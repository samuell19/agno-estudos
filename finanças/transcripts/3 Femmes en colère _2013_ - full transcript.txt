You have to move it all for a little paint? Repainting at our age. You're crazy, Alice. We're late. 3 angry women I thought you'd lost it. Me, too. Come on. We're really late. Dear Helene, I can't believe it's been 50 years. I don't know why I accepted this invitation. Maybe for you. You give me the strength. Well, wish me luck. Getting out of the cab is enough. At our age, sitting we're 50, standing, 60, on the stairs, 80, but getting out of a car, we're 120 years old. And my poor Adrien can't help me. For 50 years, Femini-Zine was a tiny group, but part of women's desire to express themselves. For the 1st time, women were heard. But first... Wait there. I don't know anyone. Who are these bimbos? Alice is still with us today, she edits our famous column, The Fight Continues. At "feminist", half of you have already fallen asleep. But without us your lives would all be very different. We have won so many battles since the 60s, beginning with number one: the right to decide for your own body, and at the very heart of that: controlling your fertility. Do you realize the Pill has only been legal for 45 years? Without it, today we can't imagine carefree sexuality. Our generation did away with traditional couples, introduced the idea of equality at home. Thanks, honey. You're prettiest when you're serving me. Seriously? Women can now have real professional careers and see their skills compensated fairly. Remember, the 1st woman professor at College de France was only named in 1973? We wanted to end the millennia where women depended on a man's good will, her lord and master. Since 1975 and the liberalization of divorce, no one is forced to endure the humiliations of a cheating spouse. We did this for you, the future generations. Dear Helene, the future generations, aren't what they were. Is Adrien here? No. He was tired, so he went home. How was it? A bunch of silly fools. Ingrates. You didn't miss anything. It was good you went to Marion's ceremony. Come on. No one gives a fig about women's rights these days. How old were you when we marched against FGM? 12. Now you're a budding midwife. Thanks to me. I have to go. Thanks, Alice. It was delicious. Miss! No, please. - Miss. - Yes? I'm going. What are you doing to your poor feet? You'll wind up in a wheelchair. No. Why do you wear those torture instruments? What's wrong with it? It's pretty, sexy. There you go. I.e, male domination. Pleasing the man, bending to his fetishist desires. No, madam, it's for me. There you go. This is it, Helene. Here I am. You imagine this instant so much, and it comes with no warning. The last face you see isn't your husband or your kids, but that of a creature out of a peep show. Yes, I'm here. I don't understand. What? The "Emergency" sign? OK. I see it. I'm coming. Go. She can't know you called me. - You're sure? - You know how she is. You're sure you don't want me to call Marion ? No. And not the girls. You're impossible. If I go... you'll have to learn to cook. Don't say that. - Shall we, Madam? - Yes. You missed the meeting. We wrote the press release. - I was with Alice. - Oh, boy! Did you tell the Guard Dog she's going to meet a real man? I couldn't. She was upset. She took a beating at the meeting today. Well yeah, if she won't let them wear skirts? You're grandma's crazy, depriving men of this. Can't wait for Friday. I'll tell her you're the queen of tofu stew. Behave yourself. She'll chew you up. Could you do the spiel for the site? I'm really busy right now? Yeah, and I've just got a year of college left. Please? Listen, your grandfather says she's doing better. Really? Is she going to Helene's birthday? She wouldn't miss it for the world. You know, dear, your grandmother's a tough cookie. Don't worry. I miss you. Are you coming to the airport? - Of course, honey. - OK. I've got to go. It's morning, here. - How's school? - Great. I'm doing great! - Bye, Mom and Dad. - Bye. Bye, honey. Our daughter is beautiful. Yes. Very much so. Thanks for the party, I didn't expect it. For France's sexiest historian, I make an effort. I went to the caterer and florist myself. I felt like a newlywed. Did you see the Martin-Campacs? 20 years of marriage, Holding hands, tickling. I thought they were gonna do it on the buffet Some people parade their partner like at a dog show. To reassure themselves. That must be it. I'll be late tonight. Don't wait for dinner. An authors' meeting. You know. Yes. For a long time. I know what it is. Anyone want more quinoa? It's great, you can nurse the 1st pregnant with the 2nd. Isn't that wonderful? - What does that do? - It's the most natural thing. It's like being a link in the chain of life, in the chain of love. Your mom must have told you. In her family, women don't have breasts. Really? Her grandma says only cows give milk. Seb, really? - Why? - They're feminists. They're missing out. Careful, Josee. It's been hard since she got teeth. - Will we do that? - Will it bite your nipples? - What kind of attack? - An anxiety attack. Physically, you're fine. You're in great shape. Better than most patients, even younger ones. Pierre, I was dying. My chest hurt. It was a heart attack. It was psychosomatic. - You think I faked it? - Not at all. In an anxiety attack, you have real symptoms. But just symptoms. "Anxiety attack", great. What's the treatment? Maybe your body is telling you to deal with something. I'm going to give you an herbal treatment, and the address of a therapist. Those quacks? Never! That's what you need. I know what's bothering me very well. And I know how to fix it. Adrien, let's go. We keep in touch. Come Prima You bring me such joy That no one Makes me happy like you Your mouth Gives me such joy I'm so lucky To live just for you You can't stand that song. Why did you buy it? It's no accident that record just reappeared. It's like Helene wanted to tell me something. Don't give up, maybe. That's what I'll do. Adrien, listen: "Based on the young generation's responsiveness, "I can say that feminism today is "trampled by stiletto-high levels of stupidity. "Such regression! "Just like in the 50s, "feminism is inherently ugly, boring, "frigid, a nag, a wet blanket, "possibly sterile, and likely homosexual." Attention grabbing. Is it a little harsh? "Harsh"? I've never held back so much. Take the speculum, insert like this. OK? Without touching the thighs or perineum. Never force it. You shouldn't feel resistance. If it's forced, you put it in wrong. Then ask the patient to push, and slowly insert the IUD. OK? Good. Very good. Get into 2 groups, please. Group A in pairs. I'll show group B presentations of a fetus in a pregnant womb. Careful. It's a bit high. Toward the bottom. Like this. Wait, look. See. OK. See you Wednesday. With the same partner write a ten page paper on the difference between hormonal and copper IUDs. We can work at my house. It's 2 minutes away. OK. Sounds good. See you. Olympe. - Yes? - Let me show you something. Will you marry me? - What, now? - I told you I wanted to. - Don't you wan to take charge? - Aren't I? It's your family's influence. Say it, midwife studies, it's to please your family. Do you really want to just palpate uteruses? Well, yes. - I mean, I don't know. - I do. You'd be better working with me, full time. You want me to drop out? Honey, there'll be 3 of us soon. You'll share a name with your child. I'm not pregnant. You don't want to. - It's not that. - So, what? Is it being the 1st to get married? They'll think I did it to piss them off. Olympe de Gouges' most important decision was refusing to marry Jacques Bietrix de Rozieres, at 23. More than words, actions define great feminist figures. By refusing marriage, Olympe is reborn a free woman. Her rejection of the time's conventions are an assertion of dignity, an aspiration of freedom, a total refusal to depend on a man's desire. It's... An... attitude that remains very rare until the 1960's. Thank you. I'm very sorry. Don't be. It's OK. Marc and I have an agreement. For 27 years. You know I admire you. Professionally? and also as? In your shoes, I wouldn't be OK. But you are in my shoes. You're not the only one. "To be honest, Marion, my wife wants a divorce. "Ironic, huh? "Now I'm free. "Finally. "I've missed you. "All these years, "I lost my French. "In this envelope is a plane ticket for any day. "We met a Thursday, so I'll wait every Thursday. "Please come to me." Should I tell her? You decide, Adrien. Each patient is different. Some talk about it. Some are quiet. I'll be quiet. You, too. Don't tell Alice. OK. Yes, yes. I get it. You think I believe that? It'll be over quick. You want to get rid of me. It'll cost you. A lot! All the money from your degrading ads will disappear! They fired me. Like a freelancer. I founded that magazine! Fired by pathetic little accountants. Because of your article? Not just that. The editors want a column by someone more in touch with young people. My mouth is too big... I like your "big mouth". That's life, Alice. The times change. People change. They've stabbed me in the back. You should have retired 10 years ago. I don't want to quit. Who said anything about quitting? Find another project. Taxi! It's no surprise they fired me. At our age, we're transparent. No one heard me, now no one sees me. It's like the manager said, "Quit barking". She'll hear me bark even louder. - I'm writing a book. - "A book"? You? I mean, now? You mean, "At your age?" She's spry. Olympe, tell your friend I'm not deaf. - I'd like to be like you? - You're wrong. What you mean is I'm old and good for nothing. Well I think it's great. - When is dad coming? - Late, I think. I hope you publish on recycled paper. Olympe says you're an ecologist. Yes. I'm starting an electric cab company. Will you plug them into trees? There are new energies. Stop. It's wrong. Under your wife's windows. She doesn't care. That's what's wrong. - Would you rather hide? - That you not be married. - Technically I'm not. - OK, Mr. Avant Garde. You've been with her 30. It's worse. You and me, it's a good time to savor the moment. Oh yeah? Your wife says you're not just savoring me. - You talked to her? - I'll call you. Are there fish left after this? - Are you OK, Mom? - Why wouldn't I be? I'm going to open the bottle. - He's a real dick. - Don't use that tone. You don't care? It's not your problem. - Really? - It's none of your business. If you must know, your father and I are honest. We respect each other. That's essential. - You don't know the whole story. - You both lie. I'm home! We were waiting. Everyone's upstairs. How are you? You? Oh, Marc! I'm writing a book. That's great. - You'll be my editor. - Impossible. We haven't taken manuscripts typed on a Remington since 1908. I don't have a secretary to retype it. Perfect. I can relax a while. Jerk. Don't challenge me. So, Sebastien, still happy with my daughter? If she's mean to you, I'll spank her. - How's the love of my life? - Fine. How can my mom stay with someone who cheats? It's disgusting. Children of the 60s aren't like normal people. - They're not hurting anyone. - Yes, me. "Organic". Yeah, right. "Traces of preservatives." E620. Hey, asthma risk. Don't buy this. Olympe, this is full of fatty acids. I've loved them since I was a kid. Look, no palm oil. - No. - Don't piss me off today. OK. if you die of cancer, it's not my fault. - Will you take care of me? - Of course. If it's not contagious. You want me again whenever you have a new mistress. She's charming. Not very sophisticated, but charming. You know I've done nothing wrong. It's the way you do it. Saying goodbye under our window, classy. Don't play the jealous wife. We're above that. No, Marc. You're already crude. Don't be a hypocrite. - Me, "hypocrite"? - Exactly. You know everything. I don't hide anything. You know my partner is more than just a fling, right? What's wrong? What's going on? Why are you acting weird? Are you starting to doubt me? Not for that. Oh, excuse me. How are things? You know, just flying over Bangkok. And you, your husband? I'm not married. I'm at a seminar in Dublin, as you see. - Is it OK here? - My wife hates it here. It's like a Brontë sisters novel. I love it here ! I love a week with you even more. You missed me so much. It's: "I missed you so much." Can you stand your French teacher? I'll try. - I'll light a fire. - OK. And? How was the Irish seminar? Interesting? Constructive? I hope. It seemed long for your daughter and me. I brought you some whisky glasses. Handmade. So this is for you. "So your book is as up to date as you are. "Lovingly, your favorite not-son-in-law." That's all we needed. OK. Let's start the lesson. OK, young man. My name's Rosalie. Sorry. Without my glasses, and you with no makeup? for the Internet, click the mouse twice. Where? On the fox. "Point the mouse on the fox"... on Radio London. What an idea, my dear. A computer at your age. Retirement is to enjoy life, not complicate it. Shit! Oh, there. No! Oh, no! Damn! Adrien! Oh, my God! I've tamed the beast! You're ridiculous, dear Alice. I'm not giving up, as you did. Did you see? Will you write about Helene? I don't know. I don't think so. It's another heart attack. - It's real, this time. - I'll call Pierre. I've been here 22 minutes. According to my calculations, you can take 52 euros off my bill. It doesn't work like that. You know that, right? Listen? it's my 2nd heart attack this week. The doctors say this is how I get better. So cure me. Do you want to get better? Do you always answer with a question? You seem very angry. When you're my age, and no one talks to you, no one listens, and people say "As long as she doesn't die here," you'll see, you'll be angry, too. I don't think it's an age thing. What's it from? You've been fighting a battle for years on TV and the radio. I've always seen an angry woman. Say it, I'm hysterical. Who do you think I am? A difficult old woman who might bite my head off. But I think I can help fix the anger that's causing your attacks. OK. Ready to work on it? Maybe mention estrogen treatment after menopause. OK. You're right. Sorry. Hello? Yes. No. I'm working with someone from class. Can't you do it? OK. I'll do it. Me, too. - Was that the SVO? - What? The Schedule Verification Office. It's OK. He's not the type. - How long? - 2 years. He proposed. Oh, wow. Old school. Old school is comforting. I like it. You know what to do, where you fit. Where you're going. It's also nice to not know anything. No. I can't. You want it. Doesn't anyone give a shit about fidelity? I don't want to cheat or be cheated on. I'm not like the others. I'd never hurt him. Olympe, I'm working. Hold on. - Yes. - Yes, what? I'll marry you. - Shit, yes? - Yes! We're getting married! - We're getting married, Max! - Well that's great! I've been down here jangling keys for 10 minutes. I'm coming. - We won't get a good table. - I'm ready. "Ready" for what? To take a shower? OK. I'm coming. I'll get your stuff! - Tell me. - Yes? Do you have an Irish dish? My wife loves anything Celtic. - Her only flaw. - No, I'm sorry. We do have a fine beef Stroganoff, though. - Maybe a clover salad? - What? - The symbol of Ireland. - We need a moment. Very well. - Do you have an Irish whisky? - Are you OK? How long has it been since you went to Cork? 17? 18 years? I saw the ticket in your bag. When are you going? - So I can plan. - Did you read my mail? I never read it. I never will. When it's lying around... Your Brian resurfaced, it must be serious. No, no, Marc. Don't get jealous in public. - Yes, but? - You're the one having an affair. But there's a big difference, Marion. I've had a lot of affairs, but you, one lover. It's worse. We never set a minimum of lovers and mistresses. I've never had to decide between a girl and you. And obviously you've never forgotten your steward. He's not a "steward". He's a pilot. If you go back, I won't take it. Stop. Stop with your threats. If I go back, it's for good. It's because I decided, on my own. "I need to take some distance. "Please get Moira at the airport. "Say I'm at a seminar. I'll call you. "I love you." "Dear everyone, "as always, for Helene's birthday, "we're going to Feuilleraie..." - What is it? - It's Olympe. I'll teach you to click. Here, click. Oh, my! I don't know if I can do it. You carried radios during the war. A plastic mouse shouldn't scare you. You aim here. Press there. - And wow! - Oh, my. What is this thing? "Stop oral contraceptives!" "Estrogen leaked into rivers "threatens the fauna and all our health. "Sign our petition. Ban the Pill!" What is this shit? - What did you do? - It's not me. Shit! It froze. My book's in there, all my work. I'll call Olympe. She got me into this. She'll get me out. Dad and I were thinking, and since there isn't much near our house, Château de Tournette is nice. It's far from Paris, but the catering is excellent. What does your family think? Do they want a city or a country wedding? They don't know. What? They aren't married. Their view of a couple is? Alternative. Ah, yes. What with the feminist activist. He means your granny. You'd better not call her "granny". That's her. Is it OK if I answer? Go ahead. You never know with old people. Hello? That thing is attacking my computer. It's my site. I sent it to you. Did you write that? We came to help you. Be nice. We'll get the document back. What's it called? XX, right, honey? "XX"? What's that, if I'm not prying. You're prying. Bingo! There's your book. Here's a USB. Copy your text here every night. I'll figure it out. But why did you write that about the Pill? Estrogen is an endocrine disruptor. It's sterilized many breeds of fish. - Amphibians change sex. - Forget the amphibians! It's saved women's lives! Alice, the Pill increases risk of heart disease. People will stop it. Do you agree? Big Pharma doesn't care about pollution. Fanatical environmentalists, cloth diapers, mandatory breastfeeding, do you buy this? Totally alienating women to save the planet. How can you fall for those crude signs? It's your fault. Coffee, Sebastien? It's hormone-free. You're so rude! Olympe, change your tone. I'm your grandmother. No, enough hysteria and paranoia. You've harped on this since we were out of diapers. Your fight is 40 years old. The battle of the sexes ended. You're brainwashed. You've bossed us all around for 40 years, but enough! Get out! Piddling child. Do you regret saying that to your granddaughter? Yes. That's a start. I don't regret saying it to that idiot chauvinist. He deserves to eat his recycled paper. - If Helene had heard? - "Helene"? My sister. Are you close? I talk to her every day. Does she live far? She died more than 50 years ago. She must have been young. What happened? It's starting. I'm having an attack. How can I have an attack here? We found a sore spot. Tell me about Helene. No. She died of tuberculoses. That's it. This attack proves you are incompetent. - Talking about her angers you. - Enough. There's no reason to. Not for me to be here, anyway. She insulted him, Dad. You know your grandma. Sebastien didn't pull any punches. He's real. I like that. Get used to it. I think he's the one. I'm happy for you. Sometimes I'm not sure. It's hard to be sure. Nothing's easy in relationships. Even after 25 years. Is Mom back? No. She's not coming. What do you mean? She left for a few days. I hope. - Where is she? - I don't know. I'm to say "at a seminar", but I don't want to lie. Did you fight? No. But she should tell you about it herself. I have to get Moira at the airport. Are you coming? No. I'll wait here. I'm tired. See you soon. Hi, it's Marion. Leave a message. Olympe, are you there? Where are you? Mom's just marvelous. I'm here twice a year and she leaves for work. I'm glad to see you. - What's wrong? - I'm OK. What do my girls want to eat? Sorry, I can't tonight. - I have a paper to write. - Oh, wow. - See you in the country? - Yeah, OK. What do you want to eat? Olympe, did you call? What's going on? Did you talk to your dad? Don't cry. I'll explain. Explain what? I saw Brian's letters, and his picture. And Moira? - You're disgusting! - Wait. Olympe, we have to talk. Wait. It's open! - Hi, Dad. - Hi. What are you doing? - Didn't you bring Moira? - I haven't seen her. - Didn't she come yesterday? - Yes. She's here. I'm making coffee. What's wrong? Olympe found my letters. Oh! Shit. Brian's pictures. She put Brian and Moira together. She hasn't spoken to me. I left dozens of messages. What if she tells Moira. - Does Marc know? - I haven't seen him in 2 days. It's Brian. "Brian"? Your Brian? - He's not? - Divorcing, yes. That's good. His wife realized divorce is legal in Ireland, even for Catholics. I like that, too. He's been waiting every Thursday, for the 4pm plane, for a month. Marc knows it all. He went crazy. He's the best man on earth. His 25 year mid-life crisis won't change that. - You know he loves you. - Stop. You're not objective. You love Marc. Well, yes. Mom... What do I do? Only you can decide that. Don't let anyone influence you. Promise me, Marion. - No man can objectify you. - Stop with your slogans. It's not about that! Stop! I'm sorry. It's not you. It's Olympe. What, "Olympe"? We fought because of her boyfriend. He's anti-Pill. You're still mad at him? No, no. You know me. Holding grudges is the only flaw I'm missing. If she doesn't come to Feuilleraie, it'll be the 1st time she's not at Helene's birthday. Adrien. Adrien! Your daughter's going. Dad! Adrien! He's gone deaf. Alice. - They should take him now. - No. No morgue, no hospital. I don't want them to take him. We'll put him in the room. I'll see what I can do. I'll sign. He never saw the painting finished. He knew it was absurd, that he'd never see it. Was I wrong to yell at Pierre? No. Dad was wrong to tell him not to talk to you. You're sure you're OK? - Do you want me to stay? - No. If you stay I'll get bad habits. We can cancel Helene's birthday. Of course not. It will be good to see you all. I'll keep my phone on. Call when you want. - You too, call when you want. - OK. He didn't go, Helene. He didn't leave us. He's dead. I don't understand why today, no one calls things by their name. The dead don't come back home. Ever. - Do I look funny? - No. OK. Come on. Let's dance. A change of scenery. We buried Grandpa and you want to go out? It's a tribute to him. Do you want to sleep? I have to go back. Seb is waiting. The Jolly Green Giant is waiting, of course. - You'll be in love some day. - Can't wait. Come on. OK. - Come on. - OK. I'm getting a drink. Stop that, now. Is that your girl? Yes. What's your poison? Men buying drinks is an insult to feminists. Your friend's having fun. Is this the time? - Yes. Life is short, Olympe. - I'm going. Happy mourning. Are you staying here? No. I just came for some things. I've said everything about Adrien. To him. We had over 50 years for that. So why are you here? My doctor told me it was important for me. if I don't want to follow Adrien in 6 months. I can't go yet. Not now. Do you have a lot left to do? I don't know how long I have, to remember? - Yes? To remember everything we did together. You have your family. That's something. No. Like you say, "that's something." But with Adrien we did more, maybe greater things than passing on DNA. That just can't disappear. Grandpa's car is nice. Am I going too fast? Tell me if I am. Stop babying me. Sorry, but all this niceness is suffocating. - "Don't Answer", who's that? - No one. A girl I met. So you decided to be a lesbian? I thought those days were done. They'll blame me. I'm not a lesbian, Alice. - Bisexual - No. So what are you? That's over. Girl, guy, who cares. You can't be a reactionary. "Reactionary"? That's a first. - Didn't you like her? - Yes. Not bad. If you liked her, why don't you answer "Don't Answer"? I'll see her, we'll have fun, we'll go out, then we'll fight. Someone gets hurt, we break up. Sounds great. Honestly, it's better to be free and have fun. Thanks to people like you, you don't need a partner. I taught you many things, but not to think like that. You know what I miss most about Adrien? My era. It left with him. I have no one left from then. It feels like today's world and I don't understand each other. - Are you there? - Yes. Dad said you were at a seminar. No, no. I cancelled. Did you know your daughter is a cynic in love? No. I'm pragmatic. Love doesn't last long, does it? - Have you seen your sister? - Not in a week. - Is she coming? - Why wouldn't she? I was the girl they wanted me to be. You were right. They influenced me. I feel guilty for who I am. I can't take the hypocrisy and lies. My sister's hair, my mom fucked up. For 18 years, too. I'll throw it back at them. That we want a baby? Insufficient charge. Oh, no. Shit. No! Recharge battery. What am I selling? "Charged for 130 km"... My ass! Hi, Dad. How are you? - Want some help? - I'm OK. Close the door. My word, Marc. You're stiff. A man with a backache is no good. Is Marion here? She's at a seminar. In Ireland, I think. It's been a while. Very funny. - What? - Ask your mom. - What's wrong? - Nothing. My lumbar. We fight and you invent symptoms. I love you, too. And? You have something to say? We'll talk later. Marc, I like you. Adrien liked you, too. So, between us, I'm telling you: you're screwing it up with our daughter. Again? You know books. I know women. You don't want Marion to leave you. So let her know. I'd go for broke. So she realizes that behind all your degrees is a heart that beats for her alone. You know Alice, I like you, too. Shit! Dammit! What a piece of shit! Thanks, honey. Thanks for coming. Come on. 80 km from Paris, and it breaks down 2 km away. - She's carrying it alone? - Gender equality. - You should like it. - OK. Olympe! Olympe, please. We need to talk. There's nothing to say. - Hi. - I'll help you. - Thanks. You'll like it here with the Green Giant. What's wrong? You're still mad about the other day? No, Squirrel, I'm not mad at you. Mom and Dad are tense, right? Why do you say so? You think I'm dumb. A seminar in Ireland. That's rich. Even for them. It's ugly. It all ends the same. I wanted to tell you something. I wanted us to be together. First, I've made up my mind. You can't change my mind. Is now the time? OK? We're engaged. I thought you were engaged in Afghanistan. It's worse. Don't you see how this ends? - Even those in love. - Enough, Moira. You've given up on love. Not her. Marriage isn't proof of love. Olympe is the woman of my life. OK? I want to make her happy. Congrats. We're not used to this, but after all? The youth rebel. That's not all. There's more. You're knocked up? Is this the icing on the cake? Not that, Moira. I've been thinking. I'm going to quit school. What? You're joking. After all the work you put in? - What will you do? - Work with Seb. He needs me and I feel useful. You'll go for with those lemons. Olympe, your independence is sacred. My "independence"? What's that mean? Living parallel and selfish lives, like you? Between Alice who treated Adrien like a poodle and you two, based on lies and hypocrisy, where is the gender equality? Leave me alone. Olympe, you can hate me and refuse to talk. But I want to thank you. For not telling Moira. Shouldn't we tell her? How can you do this? You lied for years. You don't have to understand or excuse it. But it's? It's over. - It was destiny. - "Destiny"? We know who we sleep with and when. Of course. Brian said he couldn't have children. Your father knew I was pregnant. Before I did, even. We wanted a 2nd baby so much. When I realized he couldn't be the father, I couldn't. I didn't have the courage to tell him. I felt so guilty. You don't care about fidelity. Of course we cared. Your dad and I wanted? to be different. To be free. We could do what we wanted, except fall in love. Then there was Brian. Does he know about Moira? No. I stopped seeing him when I was pregnant. Did Dad ever wonder? No. Until Moira was born. When he saw that crop of red hair? He walked out of the birthing room and? when he came up he held her and said: "She's mine. "She's mine. We'll never talk about it." And we never did. I don't know what to think. If you're a slut or a saint. I don't know either. I loved them both. I still do love them both. What's this, Olympe? You're like your crazy family. You went through my stuff? I found them over the sink. This shit with the Pill? What are you thinking? I don't want kids now, to gain 20 kg, change diapers, night feedings. I don't want a baby eating me! - Don't you love me? - Of course. I love you. I'm not ready for the rest. There is too much going on in my life, now. Why did you lie? I didn't lie. I'm afraid of upsetting you. I never feel good enough. You're a big girl. You told your family. You want to stay together, then pick a side. - Pick a side? - Exactly. Birth control, hysteria, neurosis, or me. How can you say that? How can you say that about the people I love? You're a tree-hugger chauvinist. You're all annoying! I know I'm an old gal, but I don't like to see you unhappy. I'm mad. But you're going to spill over. Cry, let it out. I'd rather let them pull my teeth out than say it but sometimes it feels good to be a weak woman. Sorry, Alice. Sorry for insulting you. I didn't think that about you and Grandpa. Of course. You're too young to know. Relationships are mysterious. If I were as bad as you say, my royal poodle would have left long ago. You're right. Who am I to judge? I'm a mess. We all have secrets, dear. So we can live together. It's not just anything. What I said about the Pill, I secretly take it, like a 13 year old. You've caused a lot of sterile frogs. You aren't ready for a baby, so what? You've got time. Look at my parents, is it a good idea? That's silly. I'm for the Pill, not against children. Having a baby with the man you love, nothing's more beautiful. What's inhuman is not having a say whether you're pregnant or not. - What is it, Alice? - Nothing. What's wrong? - Are you OK? - Yes. It'll pass. - You're sure? - No. It's... It's nothing. An anxiety attack. I'm angry, too. For these women could be free, but aren't, when they have all the means to be. It means she died for nothing. Who "died for nothing"? My sister. No. - No, I can't. - Alice, I'm begging you. Please. If you don't do it, I'll do it myself. Jacques, it's your fault. Get her out of here. Do it, Jacques, please. Alice. Alice, please. Please. Wait. Put on some music, please. Six hours later, my 19 year old sister died at the Orleans hospital. I never told anyone. Just your grandfather. I didn't want him to live with me without knowing. Olympe, I've been crazy with rage for 50 years. Because of me, my little sister bled out like an animal for slaughter. I've felt guilty for 50 years. Now you know why it's so upsetting when women say the fight is over. I know if we don't fight for freedom, we can die. You should write that story in your book. For Helene's memoire. - Marion, come with me. - No. Leave me. Come, now. That's my cell phone. My computer. My hard drives with my backups. All the numbers of women I don't care about. There's just one I want, my wife. It's you, Marion. You're insane! Stop! You're sick! Stop! There you go! With a bad back. Who will take care of you? You, like you did and you'll do, for better and for worse. You're talking marriage? I don't want you to be faithful. Or breathing down my neck. - Yes. - No. I'm serious. Be my wife. - No. - Yes. - Stop. - Let me go, my back hurts. Her name was Helene? - For who? - Alex. For Alex, Best wishes. Alice T Alice Trajan, The Star Key - Here you go. - Thank you.
