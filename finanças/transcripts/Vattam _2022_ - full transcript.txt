Hey, why are you calling me? What did you say? No dear... Where are you? I'm at home. The neighbour complained that you're making too much noise. Too much noise? It must be the TV volume. I'm sure it's the TV volume. Why are you blabbering? I did tell you not to bring home friends. I promised you that I'd never bring them home. Fine, I'll be home this Friday. You come and pick me up at the bus stop. I'm hanging up. Okay. Okay, dear. Okay. I ought to... -You're making too much noise. -I'll reduce the volume. Please lower the volume. Don't you realize kids are sleeping? Sorry! You don't seem to understand. Hey! Give me that! Step aside! Listen, my wife is coming back on Friday. If things are not in the right place... she'll get suspicious. Ask me if you need anything. Hey! That's your last drink. Is this a house or a museum? The kid's parents must've gone to the police. -No need to worry. -Are you sure? Only if they are panicked and looking for the kid, can we demand the ransom we need. This kid we're going to kidnap goes to this school. Name: Adith. He is hearing and speech impaired. Adith's mother, Shakuntala Devi. Owner of Coimbatore's Leading Textile industry. Adith's father, Mahesh Subramaniam. He's the new CEO of the company we used to work for. He laid off 5000 workers at the same time. Also, he's the reason we're in this state. The worst fear is losing the way of life we have now. We should introduce the same fear to him. I think you should reconsider this. Not at all! I followed him for nine days and have etched out a perfect plan. There's no way to get back. Kidnap! Hey, you already sound like a professional. It's not like we are going to kidnap a kid every month. We're not hunting for rat but a deer! Just one hunt! We'll score big and settle down. This is Adith's driver. He picks him up from school every day. Hey... do you think it's possible to kidnap the kid in this crowd? I swear it's highly impossible. Asai, opportunity never comes looking for you. We should create an opportunity. Hey, follow the BMW. Come on, drive faster. Once the car leaves the school, it does not stop anywhere. I've collected the details of the entire route. After leaving the school, the car heads to the swimming pool via Nehru Stadium. The kid trains for an hour at the swimming pool. That's more like it. First, one. Then, two. Later, the kid goes to another place.... without his driver's knowledge. That's where we're going to kidnap him. To open a vast iron door, you don't need immense strength. A small key would do the job! -Hey, that's disgusting. -Here you go! As you asked, I bought all the honey candies from all the stores in this area. -Good! -Only that shop is remaining. I'll come home soon. Swimming class is about to end. I'll drop the kid and come home. Okay. Do you need anything else? Hey, the boy is here. Oh, no! Just now a man bought all the honey candies. Tomorrow I'll save some for you. Do you like honey candies too? ♪ I can create life, people say! ♪ ♪ I’m a protector, some say! ♪ ♪ I destroy things some people do say! ♪ ♪ I don’t exist some say! ♪ ♪ I got something to say... ♪ -Oh, no! What happened? -♪...my King! ♪ Oh, no. I have no clue. -Please stop the car. -Please pull over. -Pick him up. -Hurry up. Step aside. Get to the hospital. Come on, hurry up! ♪ Literature is a circle, my King! ♪ ♪ Chemistry is a circle, my King! ♪ ♪ History is a circle, my King! ♪ Screaming sirens! At the Church's entrance, our hero encounters a person. A nun at the church witnesses everything. Hero falls in love with the nun. He manages to make her fall in love with him. Later, both are seen melting in love. -How is it? -Fine, you narrate the climax. There's a twist during the climax. How would you show them melting in love? Would you hand the actors ice cream? Is this story written by you? You please continue the narration. -Final act-- -One minute! Now proceed. In the final act, the lover picks up the gun and shoots down the hero. Sounds absurd! Bear this in mind my friend. Only a hero can kill his lover. Okay? -Let's go buddy. -Yeah take away your partner. I just want to have a drink. For God sake please leave. It's 10:00 p.m. now. The police will shut us down. Let them come. I don't fear the police. You run and get me a chilled beer. -You're going overboard. -Thus, the drinking. Boss... I'm finding it hard to chase away the bully. Please help me chase him. Listen, it's impossible to chase away a drunkard. Boss, I didn't even have my lunch. My stomach is growling with hunger. Hey! Don't lay your hands on me. -Push him away. -Hey, the bottle is slipping away. Come on run back inside. -He might return. -Come on, run. You can only shut down at 10:00 p.m. But no one can dare stop me from getting high. I curse that a liquor ban on Tamil nadu and all the liquor shops will shut down. How do you plan to drink after the ban? I'll brew my own liquor. Bye, drunken monk! The doctor is on the rounds. Please wait. I'll inform once he arrives. Please wait. This manager is the root cause of all our problems. Oh, no, you have left us in despair. In this company, this has become a routine. -Look at him go. -We should arrive at a solution. Sir, the man died. The laborers are pissed. I'm sure we'll be in huge trouble. I feel it's better to inform your father. Then we can plan accordingly to his suggestion-- Mr. Sivanandham. Please keep your advice to yourself. Just keep me posted on what's happening inside the factory. I'll handle the rest. Okay, sir. Sir! Wow cashews! Give it back. My wife would've kept a count. Listen, how much are we going to demand? I thought we discussed it already. Eighty lakhs, split into equal shares. Wait... One minute! Where is he going? Why the confusion? We've already discussed it. Listen, I just spent a lot on IVF. On top of it car loan, house loan, followed by gifts and galore for sister-in-law's wedding. Finally, two months grocery bill. I have a lot of expenses. Why don't we demand for more? Grocery bills are recurring. By then I'll find a new job. Oh... I'm in need of 30 lakhs. We're going to kidnap only once. I have fixed my sister's wedding. I would need 15 lakhs to please the relatives. I think 20 lakhs is enough for me. Hey! How much do you need? I'm okay with anything above 20 lakhs. Twenty lakhs? Wait! Why do you need so much money? Hey... have you ever worn a branded jean? At least shades? Do you know how much it costs when women visit a beauty salon? How does it affect one's livelihood? Okay! Altogether, we'll demand ten million. Okay, J? -Hi, dad. -Gautham, where are you? We have gathered at your place. We are waiting for you. I'm at the mill now. I can't talk. I'll call you back later. Sivanandham told me about everything. Why do you want to drag yourself into this issue? Why don't you take his advice? Then why don't you make him the CEO? Why did you send me to Germany for higher studies? -Gautham! -I can handle it, dad. Please leave it to me. I'm sure everyone is aware why we have gathered. We're dealing with a similar incident that happened last year. The labourer who met with an accident in the factory is dead. I think... maybe we should shut this down. Accidents happen. It's not imperative for us to shut down. Unnecessary unions and protests. Red people rowdyism and police cases. I wanted to run a software company to avoid these problems. He was citing the family business and trapped me inside this company. Let's pay five lakhs as compensation to the family. Later, we'll handle the rest. Five lakhs is a little too much sir. Why don't we prepare a report that the deceased was drunk. Atrocious! How can you disrespect an employee who has worked for 25 years? Guys, guys listen! I have arrived at a solution. Love is our weapon! We'll print a huge condolence message in tomorrow's newspapers. We'll pay fifty thousand as compensation to the family. Let's pay a personal visit to the deceased house. That should be fair. It's not fair, sir. Okay guys that's it! The meeting is over. Okay! Thank you. Hey, sorry dear I was in a meeting. Paaru? Paaru, say something. I'm very pissed. Sorry, dear. I was preoccupied with something. -I'm on my way. -How long would it take? Half the guests have already left. Yeah, I understand. I'm sorry baby! Did you have your medicines? Before food. After food. Did you go for a walk in the evening? You wanna head out somewhere after I come back? Gautham... today is our wedding anniversary! How can I forget it, darling? Did you get a gift in the evening? How's it? -Yet to unwrap. -Why? I want you beside me when I unwrap your gift. Thirty minutes I'll be there. Fine, get home soon. I think there's an issue at the company. You can interfere and solve it. You're one of the board members, right? I used to be. You are 4 months pregnant. You can go to the office from next month. Have you checked if it's boy or girl? It's too soon to say. Science has always been late. I know an astrologer in Pollachi. He has never predicted wrong. Are you speaking about Muthuswamy? He'll say it'll be a girl. If not it's going to be a boy. He wouldn't say anymore. That's how he predicts. Gautham will be blessed with a baby boy. What's your opinion, Paaru? Paaru, you please go and take rest. Sir, we've collected the CCTV footage from the swimming pool. The commissioner is directly involved in this case. Okay, sir. -Tread secretly. -Sure, sir. -There should not be any leaks. -Okay, sir. Place check posts. Check at railway stations and town hall. Okay, sir. -Keep me posted. -Sure, sir. -I hope you received the details. -Yes, sir. -Is there a picture? -Yes, sir. -Jaya, come here. -Tell me. Speak confidently. "We've kidnapped your son, Adith." "It doesn't matter if you go to the police or file a complaint." "Get them off your back saying your son is at the relatives." "All we need is 10 million." "When and where we'll update on the next call." "Keep the ransom ready." That's it! Speak in the right modulation. Okay? Her? Rather you could speak yourself. -Hey-- Only women are natural in threatening. Well, that's true, though. Give me the number. 92456 22321 Hey, pace yourself. 92456 22321 Hey, hey, hey, it's ringing. It's ringing. Hello! We've kidnapped your son, Adith. Check your WhatsApp. We've sent you a picture. It doesn't matter if you go to the police and filed a complaint. Get them off your back saying your son is at the relatives. All we need is 10 million. Keep the ransom ready. We'll call you back. Don't you dare mess this up. If not, then you'll lose your son. Did she just threaten to kill? You never asked her to say this. Now you know why I asked her to call. That's about it! Oh, no! You stay put over here. Hey, pull over the vehicle. Sir! Good morning, sir! Hey, who are you? What are you doing over here late at night? Have I ever asked the police what they do late at night? It's the public that runs the nation. Why don't we have the right to walk on the road? Oh, trying to be wise, is it? Obviously, sir. -What else do you expect? -Is there an issue? It's a nasty profession. You are Govt. officials. You're appointed to serve the citizens. Okay. Good, then. I ought to whack you! Arrest the guy. Sir, I don't favour violence. So, I'll co-operate. That was a little too much duty conscious. My knees are hurting can you move the seat in the front. I'll rip your knees apart. Madam. the commissioner sent me to meet you. He asked me to handle this case personally. We've sent your son's picture to all the check posts. The investigation is going on. Don't worry, madam. We'll find your son. Did you get any phone call? Was there any problem at home? Are you sure? What about relatives or business competitors? Do you suspect anyone? Only if you co-operate can we resolve this case. Sir! Stop the vehicle! Hey, what happened? Sir, I'm getting sober. Please switch off the AC. Shut up and stay put. If not, I'll rip your skin off. Sir, do you think it's fair? You seem like a nice person. Hey, I'll break your teeth. For once, do your duty. Oh, no, sir. Please don't hit me. Please don't hit me. Take this and let me go. Bloody rascal! I think you need beatings to come to your senses. -You should've begin with it. -Really? Push him off the vehicle. Sir, please drop me from where you picked me up. Do I look like a cab driver to you? Get off the vehicle. The system is not right. -What? -I said, system! Get lost! Ranting some random nonsense. One who can afford could bribe. Ones who can't get ripped off too. Damn! What the hell? Oh, God! Hey! Don't you know how to cross the road? Idiot! Sir, thank you, sir. Thank you? It's a big deal for rich people to apply brakes. People like me are dispensable. You were wise applied brakes, and saved my life. So, you're my God for today. -Fine, move on! -Okay, Okay, sir. Sir? Sir? One minute, sir. -What? -Please drop me on your way. Please, sir. I'm in a hurry. It's too late. Only the police will be making the rounds. They don't mind giving a lift. But they don't drop at the desired location. Fine, get in. Where should I drop you? Just drop me as you please. Sir, you have an amazing car. It's damn cool! It's dark inside the car. Excuse me. Do you mind? Boss, let me check if there's something on my moustache. -What an idiot! -There's nothing. Hey! What are you doing? Why did you switch off the radio? I didn't like it. You didn't like it? There. Get the hell out of my car, now. I did say that I didn't like it! Start the car. How dare you command me? Get out! Dear, you don't seem to understand my character. You'll eventually learn. Now start the car. You don't realize that you're making a mistake. You're committing a big crime! What do you want? I concur hard work is not your forte. Why don't you take a guess? -Do you need money? -Very good! Congrats! You got it right. I don't have money with me right now. I'm yet to say how much. But you're jumping to conclusions. Wait, let me think how much I need. Until then, keep driving. You have a fantastic car, though. Listen, you're getting into big trouble here. If the police come to know, the consequences will be dire. Only after bribing the police I kidnapped you. Just thousand rupees. The bribe was cheaper than your underwear. Are you related to one of my factory workers? That means you have wronged someone at your factory. It's not wrong to steal from you. I'll drop you off if you tell me where you live. Listen, I asked you for money. What did I ask? Money! Very good! My current need is 12.5 million. Are you kidding? I don't have that kind of money. Rather I'd place you in job at my factory. I'll give you a good posting. Great salary. And you know what, we could even be friends. -Us? -Yes. Friends? You're saying we'll hang out together. Yeah, why not? -What would be my salary? -50,000 per month. So, I'll get paid 50,000 if I slog for a month. -Nice, no? -Are you an idiot? Moron! I'm holding you hostage for an hour in your own Audi car... for a ransom of 12.5 million. But you expect me to slog in your company for a month only to get paid 50,000 rupees. -Threatening for a ransom... -Is the best option! God is great! -I need to fill diesel. -Yeah, we have to keep driving. Listen, come over here. Fill up the tank. Hey! Please... no! -Do you think I was kidding? -No! A slight push is enough. You'll die even before you realize it. No! Your past, future, wealth and dreams everything will disappear. I have nothing to lose. If not for you, another rich man. Give me that. -Okay. Okay. -Stand up. We were just goofing around. Move the car. The next time you run, I won't hesitate to shoot. Cool. Cool. Cool. Okay. Okay. Cool, cool. Cool! Kiddo. Kiddo. Oh, no! He locked it from the inside. Oh, God, he can't hear me knock. If these guys come to know I'm dead meat. What if he escapes? I'm doomed! What am I going to do now? Thank god! Oh, God! It's the police. What do we do now? Are you going to stop and complaint? Hey, I'm speaking to you! I won't stop. You are speaking like this is against the law. Pull over! What are you doing late at night? Stop the vehicle. Stop the vehicle! Pull over and take out the documents. -It's the same guy from before. -Oh, the bribed policeman. Take out the documents. Stop talking. Do you have license? Under whose name is the vehicle registered? -You? -Sir, didn't go home yet? Sir, is he your friend? No, he's my brother. Brother I see. I knew he's from a rich family. -He's a good brother. -Of course! You may leave. -See you soon. -Sure! The power of money. Have you made up your mind? Hey, that's my wife calling. She'll get scared. -Hello! -Gautham? Oh, your name is Gautham. I'm Mano. Mano Bharathi Maheshwaran. -This is not Gautham. -Is this Jijo? Who is Jijo? Who is that? My office attendant. No, no, no! You got me wrong. Now your husband is my attendant, driver, henchman, all in all everything. Who is this? Madam, my name is Mano. I have kidnapped your husband at gun point. The universal reason is money! I'm in need of 12.5 million. Dot! Stop kidding! Give him the phone. Come on, madam. She wants to speak to you. -Paaru-- -Gautham! I'm alright. You don't worry. I'll be home-- How can you not worry? Mrs. Paaru... Please spare him. He does not have the money. Do you expect me to believe this nonsense? I'm sure he has some cash stashed away to evade tax. As his wife, tell me, where has he stashed the money? Has he hidden it in rice sacks or under the floor tiles? Or have you converted everything into bitcoins? That means you really don't have any money. I have some money in the locker. Take 12.5 million from it, put it in a bag and then call me. -I can't do it. -Why? Why? Why? Listen, only my fingerprint will open the locker. You guys are annoying. Only now you chose to mention it. Listen, you come out and wait near the dump yard at the end of your street. Hello? So, do you already know where my house is? Who are you? Who sent you? Bloody moron! Are you even aware of Tamil nadu tradition? There'll be a dump yard at the end of every street, but throwing the trash outside is the tradition. Paaru... Oh, so she's Mrs. Gautham! Hello, madam! I'm Mano. We spoke over the phone. Let me take it off your hands. Mr. Gautham. Head straight to your house and pick up the money and call your beloved wife. The rest we'll speak in person. Okay! Madam, you please get inside the car. No, no! Why should she? Listen... let's not do this. Come with me. I'll give you the money. For God's sake, please let her go. There will be no issues. I won't tell anyone. I promise! Boss, I don't need this trouble. You must have CCTV and a dog at your house. Why should I help in creating evidence? Let's try this. Cut your thumb and give it to your wife. Let her use the fingerprint and bring me the money. I don't have a knife. I just have a gun. What shall we do? Fine, I'll go and get the money. No! -Good. Go ahead. -No, Gautham. -Paaru, don't worry. I'll be back. -Gautham! Don't worry. Come on, hurry up! Sister! Please get inside the car. Dude, you keep walking. Brother, come over here. Listen, just in case you don't like your wife and waiting for her to die to lead a happy life then go ahead and call the police. Take care! Hey, Paaru... Your father... Speak to your father through the video... Take you away. Ask him to take you away! Hey! It's not happening! I can't shake this boy. Sir, they're here. Sir! Track and collect details of all the calls made to mobile phones of this household. Just give me 5 minutes and 20 seconds. Don't you wear a uniform? Sir, this is our scheduled dress code for today. Oh! Proceed. Here you go. Who's that joker? "Give me 5 minutes and 20 seconds?" What would he achieve in such a short time? Dear, don't fear! I won't harm you. You can trust me on that. But if you try to escape... I wouldn't do anything voluntarily. Even if you escape, where would you go? Isn't this city your native? Have you planned to hide inside your house out of fear? Look, all I need is money. Once I have it. We both are good. Are you saying yes or no? It's your car to sit comfortably. See, I've been driving it as if I own it. Your husband... will he bring me the money or... he would try to go to the police and sacrifice your life? You see, he left you all alone with me and escaped. I have my doubts about him. He will bring you the money. Wow, you address him with respect. I concur it's an arranged marriage. Arranged marriage... When I ask a question, you're obliged to answer. Okay, how much dowry did he take from your family? Respected, Mr. Gautham! 200 sovereigns of gold. Twenty million in cash. And this car. Damn you man! I'm far better. I demanded only 12.5 million for both of you. I made a mistake! Doesn't matter! -He's going to live longer. -Gautham... Boss, I believe you have my money. I'm short of 2.5 million. I've asked my friend to get it. I'm waiting for him. If you don't mind I can give you 10 million right now. I'm not in a hurry. Call me once you have the money I asked for. Gautham... Gautham, what's happening out there? Paaru-- Paaru, you don't worry. I'll be there soon. Stop sassing! I'll take care of Paaru. You better make arrangements. It looks like your husband doesn't love you. He's negotiating without understanding the seriousness of the situation. Cheapskate! Did you have a boyfriend before marriage? I asked you a question! Arranged marriage. I'm aware of it. My question was before marriage. I'm waiting. I had a boyfriend. Thought as much! I know what would've happened. It wouldn't have worked out between you two. So, you guys would've broken up. Am I right? Yes. It didn't work out. These women... end relationships in just one word.

I'll be dead! Would you like to try? One Two Three! Snatching a gun wouldn't do the trick. You should know how to shoot. Get out! Hey, what happened? Let me check. Trust me I won't hurt you. Be careful. Why are you trying to be a hero? Peg yourself to be Lady F1 racer. Do you have a first aid kit in your car? I'm sure you don't have one. No! But first you need to have this. Then I'll give you the candies. Okay? -Hey! -You deny me of cashews. -Hey! -Die! -Why are you hitting me? -What the hell are you doing? -Should I beat him more? Tell me? -Let go! -Hey! Hey! -Don't beat him. Hey, it's hurting! -He can't take the beatings. -Stop beating. -Let go! -You're going to kill him. It's hurting. Let go! -Hey! Hey! -That's enough. Only if we send a video with him crying it would make them emotional. If they're emotional, then they'll listen to our demands. Even the beatings didn't help reduce his weight. Why the hell did you beat me up? We can't beat the boy, you see. Send this video to his father. Jaya, call his father and ask him to come to the race course with money. Damn you guys! Hey, wake up! They're getting a call. -Hello... -Hello, Shakuntala? I just reached. I'm on my way home. -Did you get connected? -Our son will be fine. Check if you can track the location. -Mahesh, Adith-- -I'm in touch with the police. -That's Adith's father. -Don't worry. I'm getting a second call. I'll call you back. Hello. Sure, I'll be there! I said I'll make it. Please wait for me. That's how it'll burn. It was unnecessary. Wasting my time. It's done! Did you pass your driving test or bribed to get your license? Hello! I have the money. Where should I come? What time is it now? One to one! -What did you say? -I meant it's 12:59 a.m. Hey, you do one thing. Get to the Raja street near Oppanakara street. Okay! Go behind the old Cottage Jewellery shop. Take the second left from there. There you'll find a food cart. -Buy piping hot flat breads-- -Hey, for what? I have your money with me right now. It's not like I can eat money. I'm not a donkey. Listen, I'm dying of hunger. On top of it, I'm drunk. So, don't talk nonsense. Okay? Go to the food cart. Get me shredded flat breads with extra spicy gravy. Then two duck omelettes with extra chillies. I wanted to order more. Yeah, minced meat cutlets. Get me five of it. Get them to-go and call me. Hey, wait-- Are you kidding? You got that right. Don't you want to play? Answer only to the questions asked. I'm coming! -Do you have a bike? -Bike? I don't get you! He has the money that you asked for. What else do you expect? Why are you giving Gautham a run-around? I'm talking to you. Why don't you answer? Damn, you man. You don't have any conscience. Welcome, sir. What would you like to have? One minced flat bread... with extra spicy gravy. Sure. What else? -One duck omelette... -Okay. with extra chillies and 5 minced meat cutlets. Please make it to go! Wait for two minutes. I'll get it for you. He looks like an odd man out. Look, he's holding a big bag. Sir! Hello, sir. You don't seem to respond to my greetings. Okay, forget it. Sir... Shall we share a drink? I don't understand what you're saying. A drink! There's a liquor store nearby. I have 50 bucks with me. If you give me another 50 bucks... We can collaborate and share a drink. He has something inside the bag. I have my doubts about him. We'll finish our meal and inquire. Here you go. Please leave. Five minutes, sir. Oh, God! Why does he keep switching tables? Sir, you switched tables. I was looking for you over there, and you're here. I think you switched to escape the mosquito bites. Mosquitoes will follow us wherever we go. It's okay. I don't want it. You have. Sir, come on, have a drink! Your worries will evaporate. Come on, drink! I don't have any worries. I don't want to drink. You please go ahead. Sir, a rich person like you... sitting over here with a long face It's quite obvious. Do you think we don't understand people? Come on, have a drink! A drink will give you the courage. I believe the courage is kicking in. I was right about it! What about you? You see, I drink every day. These plastic cups don't work for me. So, I carry the utensils I need. Right! Cheers! Now it's kicking in! Listen, we don't deserve this. Until yesterday we never knew how our life would change. But now we're here as kidnappers. I don't have a good feeling about it. We're committing a sin. Stop twaddling! Money is a crucial factor in empathizing or sympathizing. These are privileged folks who stole from the underprivileged. It's not wrong for the underprivileged to steal from the privileged. The privileged were the ones who fed us all this while. The juxtaposition is we got fired! If we find a new job, everything will be fine. Just getting a job won't solve anything. Working in IT is for namesake. But we are treated as slaves. They impose a luxurious lifestyle on us. They induce the fear of being dependent on the job. They use our fear against us. To live in this society, we either need authority or money. His stature and ideologies don't go well. Sir, what do you have in the bag? Money! Sir, I've never seen so much money in my life. I'm not sure if I would get a chance in future. If you don't mind, may I take a look? Yeah, why not? Hey, what's wrong with you? I never thought I would see so much money before I died. You appeared as a God and blessed me with it. A person has to go through a lot to make money. Five days ago... my brother had gone to work. As the concrete slab broke, it fell on him, and he died. He was too young to die. A wife and a child survive him. He went to work... and died! Now I'm responsible for his family. I'm sorry I kept ranting my sob story. I believe you're stuck in a problem as it is. And I made it worse with my sob story. -What happened? -Okay. Okay. I'm leaving. Please keep this money. Sir, no need. It's enough that I took a look. It's not for you but your brother's family. I'll take my leave. Sir, I don't need the money. -I don't need it. -It's for your brother's family. Listen-- -Hey-- -Sir! Money is not everything. Only a person can help another person. I'll take my leave. Sir-- That's Adith's father. Nothing will happen to our son. Sit down. Don't worry. This is Kokila's house. Hello, ma'am, your pizza! I didn't order for a pizza. -Are you sure? -Yes! What about someone else in the house? -Kokila! -Yes mom. Yeah, she's here. -Did you order something? -No mom... Yeah I did place an order. God help her! -Pizza! -Mom might see us. I came all the way. At least a kiss. Get lost. -I said leave. -That was a miss. Idiot, that's my check for you. Come on, mom. There are only 64 squares. And you keep commanding me not to make my move. Peg, yourself to be a Lady chess grandmaster. I can win the grandmaster in just 20 minutes. Back in the day-- Mom, enough with your stories. You were a topper and got a job at the post office. You boast as if you landed a collector's job. I could've cleared my IAS exam. It's your father who wanted me to remain a homemaker. Then I had you. He dwelled on mill, union, employees and burdened me with debt. I handled you and the debt as a single woman. Do you even get it? Fine, you did pay off the debt. Why don't you find me a good match and get me married? Idiot, that's my coin. Oh! Okay. I got confused as they looked the same. I suppose it was black. Fine, you talk to yourself and continue playing. I'll take my leave. -Hello! -Hello... Tell me sweetums! -What did you just call me? -Sweetums! A nick name for my sweetheart! Sweetums! Fine, what have you been up to? Nothing much. My mother has been badgering me to teach her to play chess. Thank goodness your call saved me. Wait, let me step out. What have you been doing? I was fighting with my parents. So, I came to the terrace. Is it because they found a match from the USA? That's not the case. An old baking unit is on sale. I asked my parents if I could buy it. But they refused to give me money. So, this is the reason for the fight. I pawned my mother's jewels. You're dangerous! It's just lying there with no use. let me make money. You're a family girl. What would you do if you pawn the jewels when you get married? You sound just like my parents. I take it that I'm part of your family. It's better that you start listening to your family. I have the right to choose what's best for me. -Where shall we meet tomorrow? -At Agri Park! -Ready. -Okay. Mom, I need thousand rupees. Go and take it from the cupboard. You gave it without any questions. You're such a great mom. Mom! I'll recover the money with interest as dowry from my daughter-in-law. You already have a plan in place. Hi. Hello. Welcome... We finished loading the vehicle. We're leaving. You're listening to Early Morning Greetings! Today is an important day. We're going to talk about the same in our show. People say there's a woman behind every successful man. Today is the day to celebrate such great women. Yes! Today is World Women's Day. I'm really proud of being a woman. But the questions that we have in our show today a woman is behind every successful man. -Hello... -You're still in bed? Have you left or not? How long should I wait? I left. I'm on my way. -Happy Birthday! -Hey! -Gift? -Yes. -For me? -Obviously! Hey! Hug me! Hug me! Thank you! Who are these beautiful women? The most successful women entrepreneurs. Distinguished Women Entrepreneur! Soon, I'll be on this list! Why can't you get on the list of Distinguished Homemakers? Soon I have to buy a car. Enough with the bike rides. Shall we go for a movie tonight? -My dad is here. Ride faster. -Where is he? Dad is looking at us. Hurry up! Mr. Chandramouli! Buddy, I'm very happy. -Tell me. -I bought her a gift. Her face lit up with joy. She turned into a small kid. Not bad; there's a great human hidden inside you. You know what, while I was riding on a bike with her. We crossed her father. Thank goodness he did not notice us. It's not right to live in fear. Go and ask her hand in marriage. Buddy, first, I need to settle down in life. I would like to work hard and move up in life. Who told you that hard work helps you move up in life? That's what they show in films. Idiot! Do you think a scavenger doesn't work hard? Has he moved up in life? Bear this in mind. Even after three decades, I won't give you a raise of more than 2000 rupees. Understood? I understood the last part, though. Get married. And move to the next level in life. That's where you need to work hard. -Do you think so? -Yes. ♪ Marriage ♪ ♪ Marriage ♪ Hey! What are you listening to? Hey, why is he screaming? Enough with the stare. Hop on! Shall we? Mano... will you take me to Anuvavi temple? I'll take you to a much better place. Okay? Fine, it doesn't matter. I have a terrible headache. -I need a good cup of coffee. -I shall take you. Has everyone arrived? This is our palace. Why did you bring me here? Come in I'll explain. Put your right foot forward and enter. -I can't find Eashwari. -Here I come. -Who's this girl? -I have no clue. Mom! She's very pretty. -Mano! -This is Koki alias Kokila Mani. What do you do, dear? I work as a marketing executive at a baking unit. Oh! Good, good! -Back in the day-- -Mom! Fine, take her inside. I'll follow you shortly. Come. Dear, come over here. Come over here. Mom, what are you doing? Veni's daughter looks exactly like her. She asked me to stitch a top for her. I forgot her measurements. Mom, you should've taken her measurements. I forgot that's why I'm taking her measurements. -Sorry... -Fine, take her around the house. Most importantly, show her the picture. -Your trophy! -Yeah, I'll show her. You guys carry on. I'll join you shortly. Come in. How do you find this room? This is my room. Do you like it? It seems like your mother has dumped all distasteful things in this room. That includes you. Come on, I've been using this stuff. My mother is very busy. If I ask her to clean, she'll make a big deal. After we get married, we'll clean the room together. I was saying... let me show you around the house. I've already seen it. The cats have become a nuisance. Here you go, tea. -Shall I start the auction? -Yes proceed. Shall we get married? I asked... Shall we get married? Don't think too much. Give me an answer. This is a never-ending thing. Oh, God! After our marriage, we'll change everything in this house. I need to give my mother rest. She has been annoying me. One minute! -I need to get home. It's urgent. -What happened? Nothing much. Let me drop you home. It's better I take an auto. -I'm leaving, aunty. -Have something to eat. Another day. I'm taking my leave. That's odd! Hey, what did you do that she's leaving? Mom, she's leaving for another reason.

It's not enough that we love them truly. Eventually, they marry someone... who possesses money, wealth, and status! Am I right? I'm sure your ex-lover was a pauper too. Why are women like this? I'm asking you a question, but you're asking me the same. Without any idea, how can you blame a woman so easily? I'm not talking about a stranger. I loved her sincerely. She betrayed me and went away with a rich guy. Why should money matter the most to women than true love? Obviously, a luxurious life. Shopping, car, bungalow. And a pet to accentuate the bungalow. That's what women need. Security! At least money and authority give women the security a man can never give. How? Gautham's money is going to save me from your gun. It's not Gautham himself! Only women that travel on buses and walk on the streets get raped. Look, your philosophy is moot to me. Just because your Ex-lover gave up on you I can't do the same. Either she has to die... or she should live in fear of death. That's what I want. Damn! Hey! You and Sathish are no different. Damn it! You're reminding me of him. In a way, you're exactly like him. What I could not say to him, I'm telling you now. Do you know who I am? According to you, I'm Mrs. Gautham. You did not even bother to learn my name. Six years ago... I was the youngest and most successful female entrepreneur in South India. I was a in race to achieve my goals. Sathish could not catch up to me. Ego clash! He tried to make me fall behind. We broke up. Then came arranged marriage with Gautham. You know I used to run Gautham's business. The money you asked for... I would've slapped that money on your face and free Gautham from you. There was a time the locker opened to my fingerprint. As I could not get pregnant in one year... immediately I was nobody to them. As I could not get pregnant, they took me off the office and made me sit at home. For the past three years, I've been running around takings meds and tests. Finally... I'm four months pregnant. No matter how successful a woman is, she would remain a woman. She's meant to please... and give birth! Had I been married, I would've taken good care of her. Good care as in? Do you even know how much Gautham cares for me? You don't know how much his family cares for me. It's because, I'm pregnant with their family's heir. That heir will take their legacy forward. I'm sure you're looking for the same. It's not just you. Your father. My father. All the men want the same. Look, I loved her dearly. I dreamt of a beautiful life. But she betrayed and shattered my dreams. How does it have to do with your or mine? Why don't you blame our grandfathers too? They're a reason too. I thought your leg was hurt, not your head. Caste, religion, family, tradition, culture... Who do you think put them in the first place? Who do you think has the control? I did not study history. It's the men! We're living under the shadow of men. It's the men who designed our way of life. Aren't we your slaves? Hey, are you trying to lecture me? I'm not wrong. You claim to have loved a girl dearly. You never bothered to ask about her desire, need, or expectations. She never put forward her expectations. She would've tried to convey it in some way or the other. At least she would've tried her best to make her point. A woman never seeks another man for his wealth. Even if you could only earn a rupee, she has the maturity to run a family with it. Also, a woman is highly capable of earning more than a man. But men hold back women. After we hit puberty, women lose the right to make decisions. Think hard! Your mother, sisters or your neighbour. Your lover. You expect me to run a background check before blaming a woman for her actions. Definitely! Chemistry is not the only factor of love. Get lost! If you put effort into knowing her, you'd have some respect for her. At least it'll help you not nitpick her way of life. Perhaps they'll hesitate a bit before gang raping a girl waiting for the bus with her boyfriend. You may move on and let your ex-lover live in peace. These things are well-known to men. If you don't listen to them, we'll keep repeating ourselves. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, look at me! Sir, show me your license. -Stop the vehicle. -Hey, stop! Show me your license. I said, show me your license. Sir... -Did you drink? -Sir, the license is expired. -Hey! -Sir? Don't check the two-wheelers. Check only the cars. Okay, sir. You may leave. Stop that car and check the boot. Gautham! Put the money and take-out on the bonnet and stand 10 feet away. Hey, what happened to her? Paaru! Paaru! Hey... Paaru! What happened to Paaru? -Paaru... -Listen... are you not aware that pregnant women faint often? Come on, move away. Stop gazing like an owl. She won't gain consciousness anytime soon. Keep moving! Turn around and walk! Hey! Hey! Stop! Now that you got your money. Why aren't you letting her go? Boss, money won't resolve any problem. It'll cause create problems. Only we can resolve it. Understood? The mother and the child are safe. Okay, I'll tell you where. Bring me the money. Now leave! Hey, no! Tell me! Where should I come? ♪ The silly human weed, You assume you understand ♪ ♪ The universe will rotate Only for a while ♪ ♪ In the false world Why did you become a hypocrite? ♪ ♪ Why are you going beyond the limits and are being adamant? ♪ ♪ In the midnight a big world is sleeping ♪ ♪ The poor flowers are shining of love ♪ ♪ In the street corners ♪ ♪ Where is the homeless God Circling around? ♪ ♪ Under the blanket with the holes, Closeness gets hidden ♪ ♪ The blue moons take away the love ♪ ♪ The way he lives is a distorted vision ♪ You claim to have loved a girl dearly. You never bothered to ask about her desire, need, or expectations. You were a topper and got a job at the post office. I could've cleared my IAS exam. It's your father who wanted me to remain a homemaker. Then I had you. He burdened me with debt and passed away. I handled you and the debt as a single woman. The most successful women entrepreneurs. Soon, I'll be on this list! Love is our weapon. We'll print a huge condolence message in tomorrow's newspapers. We'll pay fifty thousand as compensation to the family. Let's pay a personal visit to the deceased house. A person has to go through a lot to make money. Only a person can help another person. All the lecturing made me hungry. Okay, this looks like a good spot. Let's pull over and eat. I ordered food for you too. Minced meat cutlets! Stop staring and eat some. At least eat some for the sake of your unborn child. Isn't that... Gautham? Yes, your husband indeed! He's standing out there as if he's waiting for a bus. -You just noticed; I believe. -Gautham! Dear, look here! Who's this guy? Didn't we ask his father to come alone? It doesn't matter who it is. Check if he's got the money. Hey, who are you people? Where is your boss? What happened? He's packing a gun and wearing a Bluetooth headset. What do we do? I'm sure he's not alone. Don't give away the kid. Kidnap the man too. -What? -Do as I say! -Hurry up! -Okay. Hey! -What are you doing? -What happened? -Who are you people? -Get inside! I can't even eat in peace. Who are those people? What's happening? Drive faster! Listen, I paid the ransom you asked for. Please let both of us leave. Don't... Why were you carrying a gun? Gautham never harmed you. The GPS is going in circles. Okay, I'll take the left turn. Damn it! It keeps shifting from one point to another. Shucks! Tell me, how many more are with you? I came alone! -Where is my wife? -Wife?! What do you people want? Where the hell is your boss? He kidnapped my wife and asked for a ransom. I paid the ransom. What else do you need more? Where the hell are they? Hey, you first call them. Give me your phone. Come on, give it to me. To hell with this mask. Hey! Who is his wife? Do you fancy an affair amidst a kidnapping? Hey, stop talking like an idiot. Something is not right. Someone is playing with us. -Play... -This mask is annoying. Adith's father number is ringing. But he's not responding to the call. We're doomed! We're doomed! The police has surrounded us. Either the police will kill us if not my wife would kill me! Hey! Suicide is the only option to escape this mess. Guys listen closely. Did you see your faces? I hope he did not. First, let's find out his whereabouts. Don't stop anywhere. Leave right now! Check the last dialed numbers on his phone. What are you doing with my phone? -His number is, 73580 38303. -Give me back my phone. There's a limit for everything. You guys are going to get in big trouble. Recently... -he called a number -Give back the phone. ...a lot of times! -95972 62298. -Shut up, damn it! Damn! What is it? That bastard is following you, damn it! Hello, who is this? I will kill the kid and the man if you dare drive any closer. Asai, the second when a stranger messed up our plan... we're making a mistake. Push them out of the car, and you guys escape. Hey, push them off the car. -Get lost! -Be careful; he's a kid. -Hello. -I got the money I wanted. I dropped your people at the racecourse. Go and bring them. I don't care who you are. Don't you dare mess with me? Hey! Damn it! -Gautham... -Paaru, are you okay? Hey! Mrs. Parvathi, I'm not done yet. Look, I paid you the ransom. Hey, Paaru! Who the hell is this kid? There's another job to tend to. If you get it done... I'll pay you 12.5 million. Hey, I don't care about the money. Set Paaru free. Hey! What the hell? Hey-- Who is the kid? What kind of sick game are you planning? You're still stuck up on the money. You want to slap that money on Kokila's face to insult her. Am I right? Asai, he's still following us. -Check the bag. -Give me the bag. Check if there's any device inside the bag. Look for it. Hurry up! Hold on, I'm looking! Damn it, there's a device. -Throw it away. -Get lost. Why aren't you answering my question? So, that applies only to me? -I asked you a question! -Please stop it! -Hello, who is this? -Buddy where are you? Oh, it's you! I'm just closing up shop. Great! I'm behind your shop. You do one thing. Bring your bike to the next street. Are you in some kind of problem? Stop asking questions and get here soon! Thank goodness! Are we safe now? Look, you tolerated me until now. One last time, please hear me out. -Please help me. - No way! Why should I help you? I'm not the wrong person as you think I am. My ex-lover is getting married tomorrow. I was in confusion whether to wish or warn her. Hello! That's when I received a call from an unknown number. It was a wrong call. A girl spoke to me. Instead of calling the kid's father, she called me. I was clueless. At that moment, I incidentally noticed your husband. -Hey, idiot! -I made a decision. I used your husband to teach the kidnappers a lesson. The entire plan got messed up. Look, I neither cared about anyone nor respected a woman. First time I'm asking a woman for help. Don't refuse. This is what you have to do. I hope you understood the plan. -Buddy. -Is there a problem? Not sure. Eventually, I'll know. ♪ Hunger for money is driving me Left?

You guys are not suitable for kidnapping. Instead, run a convenience store. I had enough! Hey! Hey, return the bag and off you go! Do you expect me to listen to you?

I will shoot you. Asai, do you know the logic behind the kidnapping? We should not kidnap who are affluent. We should kidnap the right person that would fetch us ransom. Exactly! It's better you return the bag. Mr. Hero, please return the bag. -Return the bag. -Come on, return it. Return it! Hey, give it to me. -Hey! -Hey, no! Come on, get a hold of him.

Please sir. Sir, this money is crucial to us. I swear we are not professional kidnappers. We got fired from our jobs. We could not enjoy our school or college life. I lived all my life with a notion to be happy only after I settled down with a good job. When my friends enjoyed their weekends I slogged like a dog. When the CEO makes millions, we consider the victory personal. But they never respected our intellect... and fired us like we were nothing to them. Please, sir. Give us back the money. We took a lot of loans depending on the job. If we don't get the money... we have no choice but to commit suicide. Please give us back the money.
