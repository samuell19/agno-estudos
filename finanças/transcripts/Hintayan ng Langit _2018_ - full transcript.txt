I'll take care of that later. Manolo. Manolo? -Manolo, are you listening? -Yes. Sorry. I'm listening. It's OK. Let me ask you again. Why do you think you weren't sent straight to Heaven? I don't know. It's hard to say. But do you think your time was well spent? Manolo, do you have any regrets? Loudmouths! You're all pestering me! Be quiet! Give me a moment, sir. When are they coming to fix it? It's only a wall, for crying out loud! If I could fix it myself, I would have done it ages ago! Yes. No! Otherwise, I'm not signing his papers. He can rot here for all I care. I'm sorry. I hate delays. One guest was having a bad day. Lashed out at the wall. -Anyway, are you feeling better? -Much better. Thank you. This is delicious. It's a special mix. Calms you down. Have as much as you want. Ah! Your room assignment. EVALUATOR What does it say? I'm sorry, Manolo. Your assigned room is still under renovation. And all the other rooms are already full. Just a moment. There! I think I've found you the perfect placement. -You're going to have a roommate though. -Who will I be staying with? Lodging's a little tight right now. But the person you're staying with won't be here for long. You'll have the room to yourself in no time. Besides... your new roommate is someone you know. Someone I know? Lisang, your temper always gets you in trouble. Just relax, OK? How am I supposed to relax? Those animals are always running around with no regard, acting like they own the place! Just try to ignore them. You could stay in your room for a little while. Do you want to get delayed again? Fine! But, Jesus Christ, you need to tell those kids to shut up. The ride is over! Hey! This isn't a field trip! Goddamn pests! Lisang. Watch your language. OK, I'll tell them. Noted. Don't worry, Lisang. Your husband's pulling some strings upstairs. He's doing everything he can to expedite your case. Here, have a drink. Hang on. Why are you here anyway? I'm here to remind you of your schedule. It's your turn to assist the support group. Before I forget, any news about the key to the Indulgence Hall? Don't tell me you're not granting me this. Not after all that community service! With all due respect, Lisang. That's nothing compared to your offenses. But, OK, I'll follow up on your request. Oh, I have to go. By the way, I love this look. Your husband will be so thrilled to see you. Hey, Twiggy! Did someone... -Manolo, don't forget what I told you. -I won't. I'm sure you will be tempted to leave. But The Middle just takes getting used to. Thank you. Sir, you wanted to see me? -My suitcase is over there. -No problem, sir. I'll go get it for you. Shall we? Welcome, travelers! Please remain on standby. In a few moments, your respective Guardians will bring you to your assigned rooms. Let us go. We won't see each other. Why can't we just go together? Here's your room. Are you sure they won't mind? Not at all. The Middle has been a bit crowded lately, -so everyone's sharing a room. -Darling, you're flattering me. Of course. Darling, I miss you. We'll finally be together again. I love you, darling. Lisang, you've been smoking in your room again. What's the big deal? So what if I smoke? It's not like I can die twice. My goodness. What are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing. Wait. Who are you? Who is this old man? Easy on the old. We're the same age. Lisang, this is Manolo. Manolo, Lisang. Lisa. Only my friends can call me Lisang. Sorry. Manolo, this is Lisa. OK, I'll leave you two to talk. Manolo, I'll come back for you later. -OK. Thank you. -See you. What did you say your name was? Classic sign of aging. You don't remember my name? Manolo. Ah! Manolo? Is that really you? I don't know what's worse, your memory or your eyesight. Well, can you blame me? You've gotten so old, Manolo. Look at me. I stopped aging two years ago. How are you? Still looking for answers. -How about you? -Still looking good. -Have you been here long? -I just got here. Don't worry, I didn't listen to your phone call. I don't care if you did. And that's not what I meant. I'm asking if you've been here long in The Middle. No. I arrived today. I just finished my post-mortem counseling. They dug up my entire life. And now... pending case. I find that hard to believe. Pending case? You should have gone straight to The Basement after all those years of misdeeds. Says the woman who's been dead two years but still can't get into to Heaven. You must be so sinful. Now, if only I could figure out how things work around here. You want me to help you? I am not your welcoming committee. Let your Guardian teach you. You haven't changed a bit. I hear you lashed out at some kids in the hallway. The bus crash victims. Serves them right! Why put "rest in peace" on my grave if I can't even have a single moment of solitude? Lisang, what was your cause of death again? Ah, now I remember. Your maid strangled you in your sleep because you were so mean. You're funny. It was diabetes. A complication in my lungs. Hang on. Was that Nestor on the phone? Ah, yes. That was Nestor. He called me from upstairs. Isn't he sweet? Imagine, he's up there in Heaven and all, but he still wants me beside him. Anyway, I have to be somewhere. -Where are you going? -I'm meeting my girlfriends. -What for? -That's none of your business! What's her problem? We're just passing by. Good thing you're here. I think my remote is broken. No problem, Manolo. I can get you another. But right now, we have to go. Where are we going? I'm not dead. I need to go back to my store! -What now? -Please calm down, sir. -What do you want from me? -Please calm down. Money? Well, you kidnapped the wrong man! You won't get a cent out of me! Sir, drink. It will calm you down. I don't want that! Listen to me. If you don't drink this, I will burn your hardware store to the ground! Lisang! I've been here for two days. It hasn't been so bad. I'm surviving. And I think I'm slowly coming to terms with my death. Thank you, Jolina Marvie. Miss Baby? -Baby Ruth Ortega. -Hi, Miss Baby. I'm 55 years old. Hypertension. Dead at a single stroke. I just got here yesterday. And praise the Lord! I was up to my neck in debt, you see. It was a mess. The authorities got involved. I couldn't see a way out, so I prayed to God and asked Him to end my problems. And here I am! Praise the Lord! He answered my prayers! I can't thank Him enough! I can't tell you how happy I am to be here with all of you. Lisang, are these the girlfriends you were talking about? You want to get scalded? So mean! Manolo? My name is Manolo Rivera. -Hi, Manolo! -How are you? I'm 71 years old. Cause of death: heart failure. I got here earlier today. And how are you feeling? It's hard to explain. A part of me feels like... a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. But there's another part... that feels weighed down by guilt. The suddenness of my passing... I have no idea how she is taking this. I feel like I've abandoned the people I love. Sounds familiar. Lisang, you have something to say? No. I didn't say anything. Go on. Manolo... Yes. I didn't get to say goodbye. She's my child. Every decision I've made revolved around her. She stayed with me even after she got married. I cradled my grandchild in my arms. I ate dinner with them every single night. And now, I've left my child without a father. She's old enough, yes. And I know the reason we're here... is to learn how to let go of the people we've left behind. But now that I'm dead, can I no longer be a father? So, you're a server now? Are you being punished? Still making amends for your sins? This is a respectable job. You think you're so much better than me? It's still so easy to push your buttons. You and your short fuse. Excuse me, please. -Excuse me. What floor? -Fourth floor, please. Thank you, Lisang. You've completed your hours. Let's go. Look, they've put up a new list. LIST OF PERSONS GOING UP TO HEAVEN Lisang, your name's not on it. Must be your long list of sins. Looks like you're stuck here. Get moving! Try not to stare while I change! Excuse me? You're not my type. Manolo, drink this. I'm sorry. Did I wake you? No harm in staying up a bit longer. When you passed away, did you ever wish you could be with your family again? Manolo, go back to sleep. Let's talk about this tomorrow. Let me go! I'm begging you! -Come on. -They don't have any money! -It's going be all right. -Come on, Miss Baby. It's for your own good. What's going on? -This is all your fault. -How is it my fault? Your speech, it got to her. She used the TV in her room to watch her kids. I hear they couldn't even pay for her funeral. And they inherited all her debt. Hey, wait. Where are you going? I want to check if they've replaced my remote. Manolo, I know what you're thinking. Hang on! Come here! What if I told you... there's a way to do more than watch her through a screen? What if you could visit her as well? I only have one condition. As you know, my time here is almost up. And I refuse to go to Heaven without having a little fun. What do you want? It's simple. I want you to take me with you when you use those keys. Here we are. To our dear travelers, -the official list is available... -Hi, Lisang! Please look for your name on the announcement board in the main lobby for the official letter from the management. Thank you... What do you miss? Wow, I didn't know they had this here! Here, you can relive all the earthly experiences you miss the most. It's sort of the admin's way of giving the dead one last hurrah. Listen. I just want to make the most of this before I leave. But to do that, I need your keys. Wait. How am I supposed to get in if you have my keys? That's why we have to stay together at all times. Look, I can't get in on my own. You're new so you're allowed to bring a plus one. You should be grateful. Not everyone gets to be toured around by such a good-looking guide. -Who? -Me! To happiness! Lisang... don't take this the wrong way. What's the reason you're still here in The Middle? At your funeral, the priests said, you were one of their biggest and most frequent donors. And you even organized prayer groups during Holy Week. You were the definition of devout. You went to my funeral? Of course. Why wouldn't I? But I was watching. And I don't think I saw you there. I told you there's something wrong with your eyesight. The dead can see everything clearly. Fool! Hang on. If you were really at my funeral, where did you sit? What were you wearing? Did you throw flowers into my grave? This is ridiculous. I watched my service. I didn't see you there. Not even a glimpse. White shirt, black shoes, black slacks. That's what I wore. I sat on the right side of the eighth pew from the altar. I even spoke to Nestor for a bit. I didn't stay long though. And why would I throw flowers into your grave? It's not like I was someone important. Enough of this kind of talk. Let's eat. Of all the places you could have smoked, you had to pick this spot? Fresh air. I bet your lungs look like they've been blasted by a shotgun. When did you start smoking? A year after I gave birth to Sally. But I kicked the habit. Nestor disapproved. Screw these lungs! They killed me once. I'd like to see them try again. Are you upset that I didn't throw flowers into your grave? It just didn't seem appropriate. I couldn't care less if you had nothing but a measly cheese sandwich and juice at my funeral. You think this is a joke? It's already been two years. And that gives you the right to make fun of me? There's nothing funny about my death! And off she goes. Manolo, diabetes is no laughing matter. Especially when it starts attacking your lungs. I'm not like you. You suffered a stroke and what did you do? You went on drinking and eating fatty foods. Two years later, you were a goner! Wait. How do you know that? Oh, I think I could use a drink. Do you want one, too? How long are you here for, Mayor? Based on my assessment, one year maximum. -You? -Me? Three months. A year is a long time. Let me guess. Corruption? One year is nothing. One year isn't too bad. Others have stayed here longer, right? have become staff members here as penance. The evaluator. He's a politician? He used to be a community official. Community level? Yeah. It's his choice not to leave. He's not fond of the people waiting for him upstairs. I've heard rumors about an abusive father. I had a hunch during our assessment. I thought to myself, I guess that's what happens when you spend your entire life trying to hide who you are. What do you mean? You don't know? The evaluator is gay. Why would you out him like that? But that's old news. You really haven't noticed? What about you, Ben? -How long do you have left? -Only two more weeks. So this is sort of your going away party? I really hope so. I can't wait to be reunited with my wife and all my friends. I was watching my kids on the screen this morning. Good for you, Marlon. They're learning to laugh again. Right in front of my casket. Reminds me of when my own father died. You know what they say, "Don't waste your tears on me when I'm gone." At my funeral, people flocked to send their condolences. I was over the moon! And that says something. Right? Marlon. Isn't there peace in seeing your loved ones happy even though you're gone? What about you? Was there peace in seeing your children mourn your passing? I don't know. My remote is broken. You should follow up on that. Plenty of guests don't have remotes either. I should warn you, though. There's nothing peaceful about seeing the people you love struggling to move on. -That reminds me. How are you feeling? -Better now. They made me drink gallons of that awful juice. My time on Earth was short, but I've learned a lot about guilt. The profound weight of it. No one carries more guilt than the dead. And that only adds to the guilt we already feel. You know the living. To them, there's nothing bigger than their own pain. -They don't realize the dead grieve, too. -Perhaps what we're feeling isn't guilt. Perhaps it's just love. Baby, dear. That's why guilt is so powerful. -It's fueled by love. -Exactly. Feeling guilt is like playing tug of war. Despite the pain, neither side wants to let go. Then one day, you notice their grip loosen. They almost never mention your name. They're finally happy. You think they're still grieving, but no. You're the only one who's not yet done. Stop that! You're acting like a child! Crazy woman. You got Baby drunk! She couldn't even walk straight. She's a big girl. She can take care of herself. Admit it. You're having fun. -And no hangover in the morning. -It's fun. Lisang, you really haven't changed. You mean I'm still gorgeous? I mean, the way you bring life to every room, every conversation. And that dash of crazy you sprinkle everywhere. You haven't changed either. I'm handsome? I mean, you still know how to have a good time. Not bad for a dead man. Thank you, Lisang. You've made my stay here a bit more bearable. You make an excellent welcoming committee. Don't forget. I'm only using you. But regardless of my intentions, you're welcome. -What's wrong? -It's nothing. It's just... What? I wish I had asked you to dance. That's OK. We still have a few days together. We should invite Baby and Ben and Mayor. We'll show them what a real ballroom dance looks like. Why don't you answer the phone? It might be your husband. Go on. Nestor? Oh, I'm sorry. The Guardian said my husband would be calling, that's why I picked up. This is Mona Lisa. Yes, that Mona Lisa. Yes. Hang on, I'll go get him. Manolo, it's for you. It's your wife. Hello? Ester? Love! I'm so happy you called. I've missed you so much. What? Lisang! Congratulations. What? What are you saying? You've been waitlisted. To what do I owe this pleasure? Did you like my gift? Why is my name on the waiting list? I thought I had another week. Lisang, we have 32 more souls arriving. Victims of extrajudicial killing in Bulacan. Not to mention all the natural deaths. We're overcrowded here. Besides, your husband has filed countless petitions on your behalf. And I know you, Lisang. You like causing trouble but you're a good person. So, why not? I don't think I'm ready. I don't want to leave just yet. -I've grown quite fond of this place. -Right. Or fond of someone who happens to be in this place. Lisang, I checked your files. I know you're rooming with your ex-lover. You're welcome. Why don't you just delay my departure? I know how it feels to have unfinished business. Don't you worry. Once, you're in Heaven, that will no longer be a problem. That's exactly my problem. The room I was assigned to has a leak. They're worried a séance or something might pull me through the leak, right into the world of the living. That's why they assigned me to this room. Yes, she's here. Good thing you don't get angry or jealous anymore in Heaven. OK, Ester. I'll see you soon. How long have you and Ester been together? That's a long time. Manolo, we should use the second key. Right now? We don't have much time. I should apologize. I really thought it was Nestor on the phone. You don't have to apologize. Really, it's no big deal. -You know what, Manolo? -What? Your wife has such a beautiful voice. -That's true. -Her voice sounds so soothing. But she can't carry a tune to save her life. You're so harsh. My Nestor has a different problem. He knows how to sing on key, but it's as if... How do I explain this? When he sings, it's as if he's sucking all the life out of the song. You're one to talk. You're not exactly brimming with life. My goodness. What songs did Nestor pick to karaoke? Songs from our generation. Matt Monro, Frank Sinatra... Who was his favorite? The singer with the long name? Engelbert Humperdinck! He was Nestor's favorite. He liked to sing, "Am I That Easy To Forget." Maybe. Really? You mean I wasn't memorable at all? What about me? We should go in. What exactly are we looking for? My file. Number 4301, I think. Thank you. Does Ester dance, too? Yeah, from time to time. But not like we used to. There wasn't a single song we couldn't dance to. Well, except the slow ones. You hated the slow ones. Is that what you think? Well, you're wrong. You remember my father. You could throw me in the air and spin me around all you wanted. But slow dancing? No way. Your father. Always so suspicious. I guess he didn't like the idea of us dancing so close. Nothing but clothes to keep our skin from touching. I guess he was worried we'd have too much fun. So, we never got the chance to slow dance. Isn't it strange, Lisang? Out of all the people I could possibly meet here, it just had to be you. I thought Ester would be here. I mean, I think she visited me at the hospital a few times. Oh, really? Ester visited you at the hospital? I wonder how she pulled that off. No idea. I've been thinking. Maybe meeting you here wasn't an accident. Maybe I had to see you... before going to Heaven so that I could let go of old baggage. And isn't the timing perfect? I met you right before you were scheduled to leave. Lisang, did you hear what I said? Yes, I heard you loud and clear. I've found what I was looking for. We should head back. Hey, Guardian, you're cleaning up again? I came by to visit you, but you weren't here so I decided to wait. I have news! You're too late. I already heard. What news? I might be leaving within the day. What? I'm really not in the mood to explain myself. Guardian, please clean the bathroom. I was just there. It doesn't need cleaning yet. No, I want you to clean it again! Don't listen to her. What do you mean? She likes cleaning, doesn't she? I'm just giving her what she wants. Go ahead, clean some more! Lisang, I really wish you wouldn't speak to me like that. There could be consequences. And who's going to report me? You? You wanted to clean. Go scrub the bathroom floors! Now! That's enough. Now I see why you keep getting delayed. Go ahead and report me! Eat something while you're at it! You look like a plank of wood! What are you doing, Lisang? Why are you acting out? I'm just trying to buy time. They might pick me up at any moment. Now, is there anything else you want to talk about? -Wait. I thought you weren't mad? -I never said I wasn't mad. And what did the Guardian ever do to you--? Wait. What's this? You wanted to talk? Then let's talk about what we really need to talk about. -What am I looking at? -Of course, you wouldn't know. This is what happened after you stood me up. What about this? Surely you remember this. Forgive me. There was a problem with the mail. Aren't you happy to see me? Manolo... Good thing your father let you out of the house. Nestor's waiting for me at the corner. Nestor? What is he, your bodyguard? He just wanted to make sure... you and I had a proper goodbye. How noble of him. You two must have really gotten close. And what do you mean by goodbye? -I just got here! -We're getting married. -What? -I'm pregnant. You were gone for two years. A year and a half. You never even wrote back. I never received any letters. There were rumors you ran off with another girl in Cebu. So you looked for another guy? Son of a bitch. Didn't I ask you to wait for me? You betrayed me. And you expect me to believe... you never touched any of the women on your boat? I know you better than you know yourself, Manolo. Don't act like you're innocent. You don't get to pin the blame on me. You're carrying another man's child! And how many kids would you already have if men could also bear children? You don't know what I went through in the years you were gone. You were gone for two years, Manolo. I wanted to see you... so that I could say goodbye. And to ask for forgiveness. Manolo, forgive me for not waiting. We're leaving for Ilocos in a week. To get married. No. No one's getting married. Meet me at the pier tomorrow. We're going to elope. I'm taking you to Cebu. If anyone's getting married, it's me and you. But I'm pregnant. I love you. What do you want me to say? God, you're slow. Do I really need to spell it out for you? Slow? -You just don't know how to wait. -That was then. I wasn't sure I had anything to wait for. And there it is. I knew it. How long have you been holding that in? I'm just stating facts. But you're right. That was a long time ago. It's all in the past. And please, don't flatter yourself. I spent 51 years with Nestor. And I really did love him. I loved Ester, too. And unlike you, she didn't burn my ear off with her yapping. Good for you. Then stop asking me things like, "Am I that easy to forget?" It's like you're trying to make me feel guilty. Well, I hate to break it to you. It's not going to work. You don't feel guilty? Is that why you haven't shut up since this morning? When I was getting off the boat, you were getting married to Nestor. Was I supposed to put my entire life on hold and wait for your return? Is that why you ran around with Nestor and got pregnant? Enough! I get it, OK? I already asked for forgiveness for that thing with Nestor. But I will not apologize for my children. And I don't expect you to. But is that all it took? A year and a half, and you couldn't wait for me? -It was two years! -I don't care! I guess you never really loved me if you found it that easy to give up. I guess you never really loved me either if you find it this hard to forgive. This is wrong. We should have just met in Heaven, so you wouldn't be holding on to all this anger. You fool! You really think I plan on bringing this anger to Heaven? No! I'm glad we met here instead. I'm glad I can tell you how furious I am! Let me be clear. I don't regret anything. If things hadn't happened the way they did, I wouldn't have my kids and my grandchildren. I don't want you to regret anything either. But haven't you ever stopped to think that maybe you should have met me at the pier like you promised? Haven't you ever thought of the life we could have had? How happy we could have been? I went to meet you. But I was too late. But... I was still hurting. I had doubts. Could I really take care of a child that wasn't mine? I wasn't sure. I knew I'd be reminded... of your betrayal every time I saw you. But... I just couldn't bear the thought of losing you. When you went to the province to get married, it was unbearable. If you had only waited... That's enough. We don't need to dig up the past. In the end, we both lived good lives, didn't we? We were happy. Lisang, I know it must be hard for you. I know... I'm irresistible. In your dreams! You're no movie star! Manolo, were you ever... unfaithful to Ester? More than once. And did you ever consider leaving her? Not even for a second. What about you? Were you ever unfaithful to Nestor? Not even for a second. And did you ever consider leaving him? More than once. Lisang, have you ever been outside the Philippines? Only to America. -What about you? -I went to America, too. But it wasn't exactly a vacation. I had to work on the boat. I'm sorry about earlier. You're right. We chose what we chose. Someone we'll be together with in Heaven. I'm sure you're dying to be with Nestor again. What's that? Where are you going? I'll say goodbye to the Guardian. Manolo, there's a locked room at the end of the hall. Use this key. LIST OF PERSONS GOING UP TO HEAVEN I better go, I'm not on the list, anyway. I'm still not on the list. -Come on, let's go. -So disappointing. Did you see your name? Lisang! Congratulations! Why aren't you getting ready yet? Yeah! Aren't you excited? How are you doing up there, Dad? Why didn't you say goodbye? I guess you knew I wouldn't let you leave without a fight. You can rest now, Dad. We'll be OK. Dad? Dad? It's me, Angie. -Manolo, I got you a new remote. -OK. Where did you get this? From the archives. The hole in the wall. Was that you? I have no idea what you're talking about. Why did you break through? Who were you visiting? Keep your mouth shut or else I'll kill you again. Fine. You don't need to answer. Just tell me about the day you visited my hospital room. You were stalking me, weren't you? Don't be delusional! I know what you did even if you won't admit it. I saw you in my room right before I died. I saw you watching over me. That was you, wasn't it? So, what if it was? You thought I was Ester. Listen. I just happened to hear about your heart attack, so I decided to check up on you. That's all it was. Don't make any assumptions. You're not cute. That must be why you kept all those tapes from when we were young. And my funeral was one of the last things you watched. I see right through you, Lisang. Don't try to deny it. Fine. It's true. I watched over you during your final days. Your final years. So what? You're an idiot. You think you know the whole story? You don't! I saw the hole in your old room. Fine. Savor this moment. A beautiful woman like me broke a wall for a guy like you just to be there when you had your first heart attack. You must think you're so special. But why did you do that? Son of a bitch. Go ahead. Laugh your head off! You asked me to come closer. So I did! Manolo, I know you think I'm cold and heartless. But I do have a heart, you know. Why are you still here after two years? What, because you insulted everyone on the line? Picked fights? Did you steal from them? Did you murder the already dead? Is that why you're still here? Because I don't want you to think that I didn't wait for you again! That's right! I did everything I could to delay my case. Because you told me to wait for you. You almost came with me once. But you saw your daughter on the sofa, and you wanted more time with her. You asked me to wait. That was the third time. You asked me to wait for you. My father was gone. Nestor was still alive. "Till death do us part," we said, but our vows said nothing about the afterlife. I was free to wait for you if I wanted to. So I waited. Here! You should have waited for me in Heaven. You didn't have to suffer like this. I found peace with Nestor, and I loved him for that. A quiet, simple life. But you? You're the one making me suffer. In Heaven, I won't feel a thing. I'll be nothing but another blissful soul. If you won't have any emotional baggage in there, I don't want any part of it. Not when this weighs more than anything! It's the only thing that makes me feel alive. And I'm supposed to give it up? Hell, no! I just wanted to feel alive again. Even for a moment. A small piece of what we once had. Goddamn it! Why haven't they picked me up yet? Lisang? My first heart attack... it happened... on the day of your funeral. Nestor? Do you know how I'm sure I love you? Because I chose you. Every single day. Nothing. I just wanted you to know... that I love you. OK, Nestor. I'm ready. Don't worry, Manolo. Heaven is just up there. It will be your turn soon. -Ma'am, here are the files. -Thank you. Can you page the remaining passengers? Announcement for all travelers departing for Heaven. Please proceed to the main lobby for the final steps of your journey. Thank you. The Middle bids you farewell. It's been an honor to have you here with us. Are you ready? What are you doing here? This is my room now. Shouldn't you be on your way? What are you doing? May I have this dance? Like old times. If you insist. Lisang, do you think ghosts can ride planes? -Is that a trick question? -No. I was just thinking how we've never been to many places. You could have eloped with me. That's right. I promised to elope with you. Yes, you did. Still no answer? -Where is she? -I'm on my way to fetch her. Lisang? Manolo? Lisang, you're the only one...
