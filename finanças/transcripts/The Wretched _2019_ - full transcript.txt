I fell out of a second-story window. I snuck into my neighbor's house to steal some Vicodin. I went in the medicine cabinet and... they came home so I climbed out the window. That's... how you broke your arm? - You jumped? - I guess. I barely remember that part. - It was kinda stupid. - It sounds pretty stupid. Mm. Alright, okay, your turn. That is not the deal. Ahh!

You are going to apologize. I said I'm sorry. I'm going to bed. You are gonna sit there and apologize to Sara! I'm not apologizing to some bitch you're sleeping with. I'm... just gonna head out.
