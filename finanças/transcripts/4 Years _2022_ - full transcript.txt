Some people can't offer anything. And some can't accept. Some don't know how to love. Some can't embrace that reality. Some struggle to meet their expectations. Some don't even know how to fight. Some never surrender. Some panic easily. Some are so full of themselves. Some haven't ever heard of empathy. Some think that they can never be wrong. Some won't have the ability to understand anything. Some won't be interested to understand. Some give up easily. Some don't know what acceptance means. Some get awfully wounded. Some get hurt beyond repair. Some will never come out of their pain. Perhaps, some of them are you; And some others, perhaps me! These desires, this love Your steps, your breath, -Everyone, please listen! Everyone, come to OAT. Our photographer has come. in slight sobs You drifted away Everyone, come. We can't take the photo if the light goes. That's you! That's you! Gayathri... He's not picking up the call. He's not in the hostel either. He'll pick up if you call. Why this fight on the last day? Am I the one fighting? Whatever! Just call him. Is it really needed? Don't waste time. Call. Hello! Hello! Here, everyone's waiting to take the class photo. Where are you? I'm not coming. Am I the reason for you not coming? No. I'm a misfit there. You don't need a classmate like me in your memories. Hello? You can't smoke here. Go outside and smoke. Ready? Everyone look here. Ready 1 2 3... Go! YO! That's you! That's you! That's you! That's you! Fill my every dusk. Hey, What's wrong? Come. Come, let's go. It feels weird with everything over, right? Yes. Dad brought me here, thinking I'll be doomed if I continue in Bangalore. Your Dad is smart. See, in my analysis, things went relatively smooth here, huh?! C'mon! Not like that. I hated this place in the beginning. Now that I think of it, these are the best 4 years of my life! We can start around 9 am tomorrow, right? Let's take an auto. After all, it's just us two. You have only one bag, don't you? I'm leaving most of my stuff here. Wasn't the announcement box here for last year's Sports Day? Was it? Was I here for that? You weren't? It's you who go hopping around for these things. Not me. See you, bro. We are leaving. -See you, bro. -Okay. What the hell did you do? This day isn't happening again. You missed it. Where were you? I was at the library. Don't make me start talking. Library, my foot! 31 back papers! Would be a first in college history! He must be ashamed. That's why he didn't turn up for the group photo. Not because of his break up with you. What last day for me? That's for you guys. Getting jobs, going for higher studies... I'm here with my arrears. Now don't get emotional on this last day. I'm not bothered about friends leaving. I'm used to that. In my native town, our childhood friends stop talking after a while. She at least called me even from a distance. She called you because I asked her to. It was I who wrote his record for the last 4 years. I'm sure he won't complete this course. Let him suit himself! Why bother? She used to teach me on phone even on the previous night of the exam. Even when she had exams. When she came with me to give the improvement exam, she wrote my roll number on her answer paper! To prevent me from getting a year back. Will anyone else do this? Who will water these plants from tomorrow? This doesn't need much water. It will grow on its own. We can check the next time we come to college. Silly last-day talks! What are the chances that we come here again?! Hey! This is the place where we forget ourselves. After a while, we'll return, seeking ourselves. Might be the curse of my ex-girlfriends! I got out of each, giving lame excuses. Finally, I got a taste of my own medicine. What Pooja said in Class 12 was right. True love is always a pain. There's a bigger pain than that, the pain of back papers! You should spare some time to think about that pain, dear. There's no point in thinking. I'm not able to study. Whatever! We will have a blast tonight. That Theodore is sniffing around. We need your song today. Okay? Masala dosa and ice cream. Shall we go out and eat? I'm not coming. You are nuts! We can fulfil such teeny-weeny wishes now. Is going to Paris feasible right now or what?! I'm not hungry. Go on, keep walking through your world of dreams! I am off! the shores of my soul my hitherto unseen flowers my hitherto unseen flowers Like pollens over flowers We go flying like birds burns bright the shores of my soul my hitherto unseen flowers Hello! Hello! I need to see you. When are you leaving? In the morning. Can we meet now? Now? I'll come to OAT now. Come there. They've closed the gates here. I need to see you. I'll wait there. No can do, Vishal. Please try to understand. I understand. That's why I didn't call you for this long. Isn't it you who called first? I'll wait there till you come. The whole night. If you really want, you can manage to come. Isn't this the last day? Try to make it somehow. Sit. What excuse did you give to come out? Warden let me out as I promised to be back in 10 minutes. I need to go back soon. That's alright. You go. Do you know what is special about this place? This is where I proposed my love to you. Why did you ask to meet? Just like that. What if I won't get a chance to see you again? What's your next plan? What plan! I need to join Swiggy for food delivery. A bike will be enough for that. It'll help me manage my basic needs. And your back papers? I need to clear them. What about your dream to be an assistant director in films? I haven't decided if I should pursue it or not. Why?! Back in the day, you used to ask me everything, about my daily affairs, from morning to evening to the tiniest detail. Now, you don't even know this. The reason is... this time I watched a couple of great movies in IFFK film festival. After that, I lost confidence that I could do something great in films. When are you leaving for Kharagpur? By the end of the month. That is a nice place. Have you ever been there? Shall I go? It's time. Don't go. Will you kiss me? Let go of me, Vishal. At least a hug? Okay. But just a friendly hug. Whatever! One more thing... Even a friendly hug got conditions or what?! You should delete all the pictures of us together on your phone. Do you really think that I'll misuse them? Can't say. Awesome! Here you go. Seeing your desperation, it seems like there are nudes of you; I barely got one or two kisses from you. No, Vishal. Please don't screw up our last day. I won't. You may go. Go. This has ended kind of smoothly. Don't overthink. He was good... and it's over now. Okay? Okay. Ammu, when will you come? I'll start from here in a while. What happened? We have Hussain sir's son's engagement in the evening. Come early. Hussain sir?! Who's that? I'm not coming, Mom. I want to reach home and sleep. Dude, are the YouTube views going up? C'mon! Who wants all these nowadays? I pooped in the toilet here for the last time! Heavenly! Did the guys go? They are leaving, one by one. I can't believe that she came to OET yesterday night to meet you. She is good at heart. It's me who screwed it all up. If I had said Sorry when we broke up, she would've come back. Then, go and say Sorry now. She must have left the campus by now. Can you just let go of that matter? I'm worried about going to the office and working like a robot. You will get paid, won't you? That's more than enough. My father will retire next year. And my brother couldn't care less! All these are getting on my nerves! He will get a pension once he retires. You go and handle your life, man! He bought me a bike even before I asked for it. I neither studied well nor made my life better. Don't dishearten yourself. Let me get settled in Bangalore first. After that, you come there. Bro, do you have anything more to shift from here? There are a few things. Need to shift them now. They will leave for tuition after 10. Unni used to say when I go there to crash, "You're an asset to this 'Suppli' house!" Bro, These are the cheat papers made of my sleepless nights. The invigilation won't be that strict in September. Go on, use this. There's one more thing for you. Here! This is my exclusive examination shirt. With custom-made hidden pockets for cheating in exams. You'll only know its worth once you use it. It stinks terribly, man! Stink is good, man! If it stinks, teachers won't come near you. Gayathri, where were you last night? Did you lose it because I was drunk? Nothing much. Went for a bike ride, that's all. Bike?! Where? I was just saying my wish. Nothing else. I saw him, said goodbye and felt relieved. Very good. Good for you. He called me precisely at 11:11! For a moment, I thought, the universe was conspiring. Of course! After all, that's what the universe does! Conspiring! Listen, I still love him. Oh my God! What are you up to on the last day?! It's not like that. I know it's not gonna work out. Still, I can love him, can't I? I can't see him as a friend anymore. That's what bites me! See, your break up in the 12th grade; you got over it so easily. This is nothing before that. Bobby, this is different. Do whatever you want! Are you gonna take a bath? -Do you know what the opposite of love is? -My foot! Are you taking a bath? Are you not?! When are you going? After a bit. Do visit occasionally. Do you even need to mention it? After all, this is our second home! -All the best, man. -Thanks, man. This is our last breakfast. Dig in. -Are you going to die? -Darn! Your bloody evil tongue! I couldn't experience any of the pleasures of life yet. Wanna rock after reaching Bangalore! Haven't your rocking phase over, bro?! Yes. Now you guys go ahead and rock! Bro, won't you be back to write the back papers? Will see you then. Don't bother. Just a petty pest! He's still irked about that issue on Sports Day. Have it. We saw your short film. Didn't get a thing. Please explain the meaning. Carry on. What was going on around OAT with a girl yesterday? That's not good practice. You've been poking me for a while now. -What's the matter with you? -Hey, no. Whoever I meet, what's your problem? Move away. Who are you to ask? He and his damn attitude! -What's it? -Move! I said move! Do you have anything more to say? Just move away. You go. You go there. What are you staring at? Enough. Come on. I have warned you several times! Is this some market to lock horns? Try to study hard somehow. Do you even think about your parents? Now there's no point in calculating the mess accounts. This is what happens when you interfere in unwanted matters. Shouldn't anyone interfere, sir? Shouldn't there be someone to question? People like you will always be a burden to society! Let me give your matter some thought! Don't bother. Come with me. What's this? Your tomb? No! Not tomb, but a memorial to the fact that Bobby John lived here! Do you want one? Nah. I am thinking of going on a solo trip. Before leaving for Kharagpur. Where are you going? I'm in too. For a 'solo' trip?! Oh! The problem is, my dad won't allow me to go. By the way, where are you planning to go? Maybe, Munnar. Bro, Munnar is like right here! You must go and explore Goa, at least. Very nice, huh! For the time being, let me go and explore the college. Now?! It's time for us to leave. Will be back in no time. I need to return this library book, meet Susan Ma'am. Such last minute errands. Didn't you get to do these with all the time you had? Don't get mad. Just a last-day trip, that's all. Be ready. I'll be back soon. Hello. Unni, What's up? What to say, bro?! Everything's in shackles. I'm thinking of ending all these and going for some job. Hey, no. Don't give up the spirit. You'll clear the papers eventually. How many back papers do you have? Thirty-one. -Whoa! -Great! Find a job for you as well. I'll keep it inside and come. I need to drop him home. -Today's lunch is at my place. -Why? Today is my granny's birthday. Tell me, Dad. Did something happen at the Mess? Warden called me now. What happened? Tell me the matter. Nothing much. He got some grudges towards me. If there is any action from the college you won't be able to write the exam in September. Please be careful. I don't have any fancy dreams about you. But to see you get that degree. Pursue cinema or music, whatever you like. Can't you get the degree first? Are you hearing me? Don't get stressed. Call your Mom once. I will. Okay, then. Try to study something at this time. What do you want? I want to join the Pune institute and learn acting. But I need to be a graduate for that. Can't you discontinue this and join an art course? What's the confusion? Hi. -Which year are you guys? -First-year. When are you leaving? I'll leave in some time. All the best. Don't you know her? She was our lady representative. I don't know any of them. You bravely present the matter at your home. Let's handle the rest. By the end of the first year, I knew that I can't get through this. I should've left then. But pressure from parents. Do these pressurising ones know our pain? Damn! Sometimes I feel like riding out of here. Where will you go? Listen, you better study well in the next 6 months. Clear as many back papers as you can. Try cheat papers and all. Everything will be fine. Damn your cheat papers! -Hey, we are off! -Do come for lunch. Yeah, will join after the tuition. -Okay, okay. -Alright. If I get a hold of that warden...! He'll ban me, it seems! Can't just ignore his warning. Our Joby got the warning for bringing the bike to the college. Do you want to take the bike to college? Why not! What can they do now?! Our course is over. Come, then. Let's see what they are gonna do. Then we'll have a blast today. -Will we screw up? -Come, man. Four years passed in the blink of an eye. I feel like going through all that again. Feel free to take my chance. Gayathri is here! Didn't she go home yet? Didn't you say a Sorry can sort everything out? Go and apologise. That won't work. Don't spoil the time because of your ego. Go, talk to her. Make it fast. Go. Window panes of memories Hey! What's up? Nothing. This is no place for goofing around, right? Come. Let's talk. The treasure of my memories I was searching for you. What's up with the criterion collection? I've told him. Your friend, that associate director... I've told him that. Film Club will be closed if no screening happens this time. -We will sort it out. -Okay My only choice Can you join, Sir? Tell me, man. The security guard caught me. He took the bike keys. Where are you now? I'm here outside. Today is my granny's birthday. I need to reach home for lunch. You leave. I'll sort this out. Are you sure? Yes. Call me if there's any issue. My only choice The treasure of my memories Gayathri, can we sit in the canteen? It's time for me to go. Bobby must be annoyed already. What do you have to say, Roshan? I've informed Bobby. Just 5 minutes, please. It will take time for the auto rickshaw to come. Can we sit for five minutes? I sent some messages on WhatsApp yesterday. I think you haven't seen them. Vishal... I've been calling you for two days now. Can't you attend the call? How many messages did I send? Anna, I'm not interested in doing a skit now. Okay, forget the skit. But still, can't you attend when I call you? Hope you don't mind. Our academics are similar. And the job profile matches too. We can back each other in our career growth. Our families know each other as well. It's not that I waited for the last moment to communicate this to you. But I feel like I'll miss you if I don't share this now. Roshan, I haven't really given it a thought. No, I won't hurry you. You think well and give a reply. Take your time. You'll pass if you approach Paulson Sir. I'm sure of it. I can help you in the evenings. Just relax. Everything will be fine. Have you got any financial problems? What problem?! I don't really want to settle in the US. I can come back and-- Sundar! One strong, black tea. Add extra sugar. Hey, get him a strong black tea with extra sugar. We are discussing something serious. Carry on. Isn't this the college canteen? Can't I sit here? Gayathri, come. Let's sit there. Yeah, go and sit there. I'll give you company. Vishal, did you start it again? What do you mean? Can't I sit here and drink tea? Drink it peacefully. Gayathri! Gayathri! Gayathri, just one minute. Let him sit there. Let's take another table and talk. I'm getting late, Roshan. You broke up with her, didn't you? What's the matter now? Hey, lover boy, be seated. Let's talk. How did it go? Was it you who arranged that meeting with Roshan? He's a cool guy. You both will make a great match. Isn't he okay? Are you not busy now? Don't you want to reach home by noon? What's wrong? I'll kill you today. Did I screw up? Sundar is great! He's been working here for 50 years now. It doesn't bore him at all. I can't even think of it. How many batches did he see?! What's your problem? What problem?! What's your relationship with him? I don't have to tell you that. Fine. Why are you stalking me like this? Can't I go to the canteen?! He's cool, huh! After all, you both are family friends. I don't really need your certification for that. Don't poke your nose into my affairs. Is that clear? Very clear! See, stop mocking me. Who mocked you? Go, marry him and get settled. You... You are never gonna change! It's in your blood. You blow up everything right at the last moment! I don't want to see you anymore. What's your issue now? Who do you want? Listen, academics, family status, social status, looks, intelligence, Roshan has all these! That's why I set you up with him. Who the hell are you? My wedding broker? You better don't part ways fighting with me at this last moment. I... I'm only trying to help you. See, either way, you were aware that Roshan's got a soft corner for you. For the same reason I was avoiding him, Bobby! You know what? Whatever! Just talk it out tomorrow when he calls! Will he call me again tomorrow?! Okay, drop it! I'll cancel it. Fine?! I don't get you. That's why I'm asking... You forsake Vishal as he was damn impractical. Okay! Fine! And now Roshan is not an option as he is damn practical?! What do you want, man?! Leave it. What did you do with Vishal? What to do?! We parted happily yesterday, talking things out. And today, it's damned. I'm not going to see him again. See, these feelings within you will tone down once you take the bus. It will tone down more once you reach home. And with time, they will disappear. Come now. It's getting late. Gayathri... come! This is the last warning. -Okay then, bye. -Bye, dear. Gayathri... Just a second. Need to tell you something. Why is he here?! Can I drop you at the bus stop? Didn't we plan a Munnar trip for our last day? Will at least go till the college junction, together. I won't screw this up. We shouldn't part ways at odds. Come. What?! -You go, I'll come. -What?! He'll drop me at the bus stop. I heard him mentioning Munnar... No Munnar and all! Only till the college junction! That's all. Wait, wait! I'll bring it for you. What if you change your mind in between?! Don't worry. I'll wait for you at the bus stop. Go. Let's go. Why is it so difficult for you to say sorry? What's the point? Can I swallow my own words? It'll bring some peace to the one who hears it. When I saw you at the canteen today, I remembered our last Onam celebration. We bunking the class and sitting in the canteen during the rain, all those... That's why, I got mad seeing you with him today. Now the canteen would remind me of today's scene. That's not true. What gave you the guts to come to the ladies hostel today? I was about to leave. But then, I felt like seeing you. This is better. Why so? It's good if you stop remembering me. Is it that easy for you... to forget me? Why should I forget you? Then? Let that memory be there... somewhere in the corner. Then why should I forget you? You're destroying yourself, Vivi... I don't want to be the reason for that. Isn't that better? What a great day to offer a bike ride! It's pouring! I will fail this paper, even if I clear the rest. I failed in this viva only because of you. So, I was a fool to teach you, now all the blame is on me! Isn't this hydraulic arm? Don't cheese me off! Where were you lost during the whole six months of lab sessions? In you! In fact, six months is not the right calculation. We barely had four months. No idea why they are brewing us in these incubators! Ain't I right? You sent me a message this morning and then deleted it. What was that? Nothing. C'mon! Tell me. I resent a haiku you sent me before. Which one? "I wish you held on to me like I held on to hope." "Like I held on to hope." Can't you trim this? On this earth For whom? In the chariot of moon leaving the door behind closed you sweet bird Isn't this enough? Let that flirt Lazar get drenched. Come. In the chariot of moon leaving the door behind closed -Do you remember that song? -Which one? The one I dedicated for you before your 200 metres. Ha! I lost after hearing that song! Flying near the slow blooming flower Strike to wear Dhoti in campus! Strike for opening the swimming pool for students! So many such flop strikes! Haven't you had enough? If there were someone to back me up, we would have won all those. You people are only fond of watching the show. you sweet bird At any cost, you shouldn't marry him! Why?! You shouldn't! Don't marry anyone from the college! Marry anyone from outside. Get lost! I search for you This day will never happen again. Everyone was very emotional while leaving yesterday. I sat on your seat for a while. What a place of fond memories, isn't it? Yeah, true! Here is where we broke up! Why did you leave me? I told you, Vivi... By 4th year I was unable to concentrate on my studies because of your calls and all the confusion. Be honest. If I know the reason, maybe I can forget you. Just tell me. Your bad temper! I was tired of trying not to make you angry. I can't live like that. It's not practical. Not practical! That's okay. Where are you? Are you coming? Got stuck in the rain. -Will it take more time? -No, we are coming. Alright. Shall we go? Okay. Today when I met Susan Ma'am, she told me about her last day here. I hate that woman! What story? As she was about to leave the hostel, a junior gave her a letter to post. They had a letter box only in the town then. Is this the so-called story?! The thing is, she forgot to post it. She saw that letter only after 10-15 years. I'll be surprised only if she does the opposite! Just listen. She realised on opening the letter that the junior wrote it to her lover. Telling him she'll commit suicide if they don't elope in a week. Ma'am got worried and called her, finding her number. But that girl married someone else and was living happily. The boyfriend in every era is an idiot! Why? Can't that lover also end up well? Do you know why exactly she told you this story now? You won't get it even if I explain. That's your problem. Are you not coming? I'll miss this place. That's for people like you. It's a place I don't have a pleasant memory by any means. You may feel so now. Your opinion was different four years back. C'mon! Do you know what your biggest advantage is? What? You only do what you like. My foot! After leaving this place, I won't be living the life I want. I'm sure. Before, you wanted to study literature and be a teacher, didn't you? Now, an M Tech in Kharagpur! Like that, this will also keep changing! For the time being, manage with what you have! Shall we go? Everyone here must be having similar stories to say! Still, we'll all remember this place. Okay then. Are you done?! We just walked for a while. Come in, man. Be seated. I don't see you here these days. Did the other guys come up with any more issues? Nah, nothing. Police won't make any issue now. Be alert when you go to the theatre and all. Chances are there for the same scenario to repeat. They're not the good ones. Hello. If you are joining, come tomorrow. The-pre production will start day after tomorrow. I barely managed to get you this chance. And what's the matter with you now? Come to a decision. Will call you later. If you're coming, reach Coorg tomorrow. Or else, don't call me again for this. Any issue? No, no worries. If there is something, don't hesitate to tell me. Let me take your leave. Didn't you go? Bobby left. I need to go towards this side, right? I forgot that. Bus will be here now. Okay. I'll see you off. If only you had taken that auto directly from the hostel. I would have reached home or would be on the bus now. I would be in the 'Suppli' House, lying, depressed. Should I throw it away?? Can you? I did! Are you hungry? Yeah, I've started feeling slightly hungry. I need to eat something on my way. Do you wanna try my cooking one last time? It's already late, isn't it? No time! Time is in our hands. If you come, I'll cook some nice food for you. Where? 'Suppli' House. I'll hardly need 30 minutes to cook. Marvellous! I'm serious! No, I'm not coming. Is it because you don't want to come or you have no guts to come? Or you're just pretending a 'no?' What?! Are you coming or not?! You'll regret this for sure! Perhaps, for the rest of your life! Why should I? If you had reached home now, you would've missed today's morning, right? Maybe! Maybe?! Alright! Yeah. Just like that, you'll miss this as well! I'm very sure! No buses are coming. Did they announce an emergency strike or something? Please come. I promise you a good food and a beautiful time. Isn't it enough? Come. Let me call my home and inform. Yes! Hello. Hello. Give the phone to Mom. I'm not home now. How many times have I told you not to go out with that phone?! Will talk to you in the evening. Sister, you hang up now! How did it go? Nothing. Come, let's go. Okay. Have you ever come here before? Yeah. There's a shortcut from the Ladies' Hostel to come here. Didn't you meet with an accident when you came to bathe here? Yeah, after that there are some restrictions here. Do you know any guys who stay here? No. But we do have a special sympathy for them in our hearts. Whenever we pass through this way, we do give them a sweet look! For inspiration. Aha! But I have never seen it. I started coming here regularly after our break up. Is there anyone inside? This place is never completely vacant. Are you not comfortable? Is nobody inside? I think no one is inside. Since there is no lock for the front door we get in through the back door. They'll be there. Let me check if there is a spare key here. Where are you? We both are at Gabri's house. And you?! Where can I find keys to the 'Suppli' House? Key... Maybe they took it when they went for the movie. Is that him? Gimme the phone. When are you coming? Granny is asking for you. Can I come later? I'm not in a good mood now. His damn mood! Suit yourself! What happened with the bike issue in college? That's cool. Okay, you come without much delay. They took the key. Shall we go, then? It's sad that I couldn't cook anything for you for the last time! That's our fate! Darn! There's another thing! -What?! -Come. Come on! You lack the expertise! Let me concentrate. Do you know all these? How did you learn all these? That all happens. Won't this be a problem if other guys get to know about this? What problem? Come in. Take a seat. Let me check what all are there in the kitchen. There is rice and lentils. Will rice and lentils do? Anything as you please. Okay. This house is nice. It got similar vibes as my ancestral home in Thrissur. Will you have fish? No. -Sure? -No. There is poppodum. Will fry it. Which one is your room? Upstairs. -In this attic? -Yes! Won't you feel suffocated? What suffocation? It's a very peaceful place. Need any help with cooking? You can give a hand, if you want! -Will join you in a minute. -Okay. Your taste is not bad. Nice ambience. That's exactly what I told you. Enough goofing around there. Come down. There's work for you. I reached home, had food and all. Did you reach home? No, I thought I'll eat and go. Will call you after reaching home. That was Bobby. She reached home, it seems. Shall we make some chutney? Don't you like it? Then, here you go. Scrape the coconut! You scrape the coconut. I'll clean the rice. Like that? Will you help? There's a chilli plant there. Can you pluck some chillies for me? My hands are occupied. I can't do so many tasks at a time! Okay! I will go and get it. What about adding some curry leaves in the chutney? It will be nice. We can try. Okay. Reduce the gas a little. Let the lentils don't get overcooked. Aha! So you know all these! Of course! Listen, make it fast. I'm hungry. If you are that hungry, I've got a special combo! With bread, mixture, shallots and all. If you want, I can make that for you. No need. Okay. Any appetiser? What's the item? Won't be any branded one. No need. Enough. Try this. How's it? It's good. Have it. Take some, or I'll finish it. There may be pickle in the fridge. Do you want it? No, it's okay. This chutney is enough. Nice. Sometimes I feel like doing something in music. Then, do it! But for that, I need to study, right? Isn't it very late for me? It's not late at all. You can still learn it. SPB, the singer, had no classical training. Do you know? One needs to be lucky for that. Luck will come. Just take the first step. Start learning. Let me finish what I need to study here! I have no clue how I can clear my back papers! Shall we go? If I don't start now, I'll be late by the time I reach home. Shall I drop you home? All the way till Kakkanad?! It's hardly a 45 minutes drive. I'll drop you. No, I'll go by myself. I won't come near your flat. I'll drop you near Infopark. Then it's just a walkable distance for you. Don't take it for free. You can pay for the fuel. Scram! Please. Okay. Okay. Then you can stay a bit longer here. For what? Will just sit. We can't, again. Great. So, don't lose your temper at anyone for a week. I'll try. If this falls in the bottle, you should show me your 11:11 tattoo. Nah! No way! You have to! It's part of the game. You throw it first. Okay, my turn. A clean shave! Yuck! Part of the game! Superb! The lover Susan Ma'am mentioned, It's she herself! Not any junior or any crap! See! She tells the same story to all the girls to ruin their affairs. Okay, okay. No smoking for a month. One month?! Reduce a little. Two weeks. One week? What's the point then? I can do what is possible, right? I would've tried if it fell. -Shall I take one more chance? -No! My turn. If this falls... I get a kiss. Shall we go? I will lose it if we go on. Shall we go? Vivi... Let's go. Sky looms above On the dreamy strings Follow me all way The spring of Life Make it memorable. Sky looms above On dreams What happened? Tell me. A bus towards my side did come. I intentionally didn't get in. Why? To see you once again when you come down. You cleared this exam, right? Then why's this book here? Didn't we get back after our first break up? You taught me this, then. I kept it here in that memory. What is this for? For you to be with me. Any objection? Then, let this be with me. I'll buy a new packet and smoke. Still, you won't smoke this, right? Don't you want to go? I have time for a tea. Do you want one? I'll nail this tea! Then go and make tea. Okay. Nice tea. My grandfather used to make great tea. He had a small tea shop in Nadapuram. Later, it got shut down due to communal issues. That used to be the regular hangout of me and my brother. Your brother is still in Chennai, isn't he? Vivi, people change after their marriage. We should give them their space. Does his space mean forsaking your family? It's been an year since he visited Dad and Mom. He should try to understand their issues as well. Have you ever tried to understand them? I do. Just that, now I'm not able to be of any help. You must be just over thinking. Your brother called you to Chennai. Just go there once. Maybe, everything will get okay with that. I might depend on anyone, but my brother. Then don't go. If nothing works out, start a mobile tea shop in front of our college. That will come off well. That idea is cool. Just be calm and think. You'll get many such good ideas. Won't you miss me? Slowly you will forget me once you make new friends in Kharagpur. Right? Do you know what I am gonna miss the most? Your smell! What do you dislike the most about my character? Your aggressive planning. What planning?! Plans like "when to get pregnant without affecting my career?" Is it a bad thing? Such over planning is what leads people to disasters. Especially when there are no right people with you. Alright. Why is Bobby always irked with me? -What irk? -She doesn't like me. Her damn bodyguard-ing! She's the reason for our break up. I wanted to give her a tight one before leaving. What are you even saying? What did she do?! She doesn't like my nature, my political stands, family background or anything about me. Even I don't like your so-called political antics! What's the issue with it? How much time did you waste on that? In fact, there is nobody as talented as you in our class. But you don't have focus. Talent, my foot! If you don't get mad, can I tell you something? Tell me. Is there a point in studying hard and clearing all your back papers? You mean, I'm not capable of it? I mean, there's no need for it. You're not meant for this college. You should be in arts, music, films, cooking, something of that sort! What on earth! I'll bet that I'm gonna clear all the 31 papers in September. Do you wanna see? And then? And then you'll be an engineer like me and work in a cubicle for life-long? After watching a few great movies, you realised that you can't be a filmmaker, right? That realisation is all you need to do whatever you want. Everyone won't get this call, Vishal. Why can't you understand that? Whether in life or in career, everyone gets to face an impasse. You should just make a conscious decision and move on. Or you'll be trapped here. After completing M Tech, and getting a job it's easy for you to advise me! You also need to understand my situation. What do you want in your life? You need to decide that first. What I need is you! Can I get you?! It's easy to advise! Follow your dreams, focus on your goal, my foot! Goddammit! You biggest problem is this temperament of yours! When you proposed to me, there was a sense of calmness. That's what I fell for. Now you behave like my father! Now you father-zone me! That's all is left to do! Let's go. You finish your speech and go. Where should I focus? Let go of me, Vishal. Just tell me where should I focus and then you go! Let go my hand, Vishal! Please tell me, Gayathri! What should I do? Sometimes, I feel like killing myself! I don't know. I was just kidding. You leave it. Is my life a joke for you? What did I do? If you were not there, this damn love-affair would not have existed. I would have cleared my exams somehow. Now you blame it on me. Yes, you're the reason! You motivate me... give empty hopes and at last you leave, ruining it all for me! It's not your mistake, but mine! That I loved you and trusted you. Just get lost! I wish I never met you! Where to? Same as hers. I screwed up again. -I didn't mean any of it. -Here's the balance. Please say something. Come. Come with me. I'll drop you. Get down from the bus. Gayathri... After getting angry, your every word is extremely hurtful. You can't take them back. I know I'm messed up nowadays. If you leave me, it will only deteriorate! Then, nothing will come to my control. Don't I have a life of my own? Is my life all about mending you or what?! I'm trying to fix everything. Give me some time. Today was the first time we spoke after six months. And then what happened? You come to your real self! What is the guarantee that you'll change? Gayathri... If you're with me, it will be very helpful for me. Many of my coming years are sorted. I need some time off from all these. We won't work out anymore. Nobody can substitute you. I know that well now. Please. There's no hurry. Take your own time, complete your course, plans and all! Maybe, I also need that time. But, please let me see you. Why are you doing this, Vishal? Please! I need you! Do you know why I came with you today? Do you know why I came when you called me last night? Because I feel safe and comfortable with you! I tried my best to make you comfortable too, and also to make this relationship work! What else should I have done?! Can't you give me one more chance? Take your own time. Two years to complete M Tech, and another year for you to get settled. I can wait one more year. Is it okay for you? Won't it take really long? Anything can happen within that time. None of these are realistic. You don't need to promise me anything. But can't we meet once? Won't we understand where we are then? Can't we wait till then? Don't contact me till then. Let's just be strangers until then. Okay. Today is the 25th of November. Then, shall I contact you on 25th November 2026? So, now you are into planning and all? Don't I need some fuel to wait till then? It will happen if it's meant to happen. I'll get down at the next stop. Can I click a selfie? One way junction! Anybody to get down here? One way junction! Stays in me, unfading Without seeing my spring close to you bid adieu even when we are close? What the hell are you doing, man? You broke the lock and kept all the doors open as well! What if the house owner sees this? Sorry. Hello. Where are you off to? Don't do anything stupid. Are you going home? There are many other places to go. Which place? I'll call you later. Are you going for that cinema thing? Or to your brother's? Stays in me, unfading Without seeing my spring bid adieu even when we are close? even when we are close? I travelled a lot. Visited many places. Saw many beautiful visuals. Studied many people. I got happiness. Shared my grief. Many days came. Many nights came. Said many truths. Was embarrassed several times. Received many. Lost many. Cried a lot. Laughed a lot. Learnt a lot. Still, I received no good memories than those 4 years, This song is for her. For the day I'm going to meet her again.
