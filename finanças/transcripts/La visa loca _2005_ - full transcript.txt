Girls! Girls! We have beautiful girls! Girls, sir? Females! Girls! We have beautiful girls! - How much? - Two hundred fifty. - Sir! Girls, two hundred fifty only. - How much? Two hundred fifty. Sir, all our girls are fresh... and fat! - Too expensive. - Sir, all our girls are fresh... and fat! Still too much. Never mind. Sir, you want girls? All our girls are fresh... and fat! Sir, you want girls? Two hundred fifty. - How much? Two hundred fifty. - You have males? - We have. - We have big males today. - You want males? One hundred fifty. Let's see them. Give us a discount. We'll get three. That's the cheapest I can go, man. Come... You have gays? No. Some dude got them all a while ago. Must be having a party. Why don't you get the females. They're full of crab fat. Look! Ms. Babes, did Dad drop by here? He was supposed to, but he didn't. Must be at the sign shop. Your Mom... is dead. A truck hit her when she was crossing the street in New Jersey. Your uncles and aunts are burying your mom in the States. Dear God, Please grant me a visa. Have mercy on me, I will hear mass regularly. I will quit smoking and stop looking at girls with lust. That's all. Please just a visa. Please. Long live Saddam Hussein! Long live Saddam Hussein! - Long live Saddam Hussein! - I'm sure he got denied... Sir, where is the courier office for approved applications? Just hand this to the lady in yellow and wait for your number to be called. Okay thanks. Many times he lost his pride, He failed to go the States and hide. Just a visa, to God he prayed and yet he failed. O true and noble chauffeur he is. An American life is all I wish. Hoping any chance will show. Just to earn some mighty dough. Will you earn more than 50 grand if you're here or in a foreign land. Good thing you're here, Jess. I suggest we buy a new television set. I've turned it to full volume already and I still can't hear anything. Can you change the channel? Perhaps the signal on this one's just bad. - Which channel? - Huh? - I said which channel? - I told you to change the channel. I said which channel? WHICH CHANNEL? Whatever. This is your chance to be blessed with a US visa. Why don't you wear your hearing aid so you can hear? What? Did you say something? I can't hear you. I'm not wearing my hearing aid. I said-- Why don't you wear your hearing aid so you can hear? It's so expensive. Annette bought it for you and you're not using it! What? The hearing aid! Oh that! The hearing aid? - Yes the hearing aid. - It's not working. Can you ask your fiancee to get me a new pair? - There, HEARING AID! - It's embarrassing to ask for a new set. It was a present for you and you lost the other pair. - Dad, did anybody call? - What? Phone? Anybody called? Phone call for me? Telephone? Oh yeah, your stingy fiancee called. What did she say? What did she say? What did she say? I don't know... I couldn't hear what she's saying. Jess, can you help me put medication on my eyes? Don't move. It's almost done. I'll help you take your insulin shots. ...You have to be patient with Dad. He's really like that. Well, what can I do? So how was your interview at the embassy? How many years is the validity? Well... I got denied. Why? Were you able to answer the questions? Were your papers complete? You should have told them you'll be here for a holiday. Did you tell them you have a fiancee here? I answered everything but the consul was really strict. He even questioned why my birthplace was spelled SEXMOAN. Is there a way you can petition for me? Well, not so soon. have to be a US citizen first. What about your nursing aide training? Can't you use that? I paid a bundle for that. They're offering me work... in the Middle East and Turkey but I don't want to go there. And there are no offers from Canada either. Do you know any fixers who can help you? I think 10,000 pesos should be enough for that. I don't know. I don't know of any fixers. My friend Estong probably knows some. I know a fixer from the projects ...but I can't remember his name. He says he's the consul's drinking buddy... What's his name? It starts with the letter "H". Hector? No. Herbert? No, that's the actor. Julio? Idiot! There's no "H" in Julio. It starts with "#"... ROGER! Roger Policarpio! Roger? There's no H in Roger. RHOGER but it's silent H like some French words. It's like Vhong... and Jhun. How much did they pay him? My cousin went to him once. He paid 10,000 bucks. - So did he get a visa? - No. He had an asthma attack during the interview. They had to take him to the hospital. He died soon after. By the way, why were you denied a visa? Estong, look! It's Lex Halcon and Salma Hayok. Gosh! Those are huge tits! Do you think it's true what she said on TV, that she's still a virgin? Virgin my ass! How can she be a virgin if she wears thong panties? - You mean, a girl can't be a virgin and wear thong panties? - Of course, man. Why would she wear it? She wants to get laid, you moron. Really? She's not a virgin? I don't like her anymore. You sound hurt. She lied to me. You sound as if you get to talk to her. I do... on TV. You're one of a kind, dude. ...And you think she likes you, right? That Lex Halcon dude's got a huge belly. And he gets weird when he's drunk. He beats up waiters. He beats up waiters? No way will I work for that guy. Being a punching bag hurts. It hurts, but I heard... He gives 10,000 pesos to the guys he beat up. - 10,000 bucks? Really? - Really. C'mon Jess, it's in the papers. He frequents the Unicorn Club and the waiters just love him. Animal! You almost gave me a heart attack! Thanks for helping. Basilio?... Crispin?... Where are you my children? That's Mr. Luna of Malabon... In line 2 is Sancho Huson... What's up, Mr. Sancho? - Hello? - Hello? Mr. Sancho? Mr. Sancho can you lower your radio's volume? We're getting feedback. Oh sorry... sorry. - I can still hear something... - Wait, I think I know where it's coming from... How's that? It's my hearing aid that's ringing. What's up, Mr. Sancho? Well, actually... I just want to make a comment on what your guest-- the gynecologist said. I noticed that the doctor uses English. She never uses the Filipino word for... penis, vagina and pubic hair. Why can't she use the Filipino word for penis or vagina or pubic hair? Is she ashamed of our language? Is our language offensive? Or she just has colonial mentality? That's probably not the case. Perhaps that's how they were taught to describe things in medical school. ...Now, wouldn't anyone be ashamed if he has a father like that? Jess... Jess, wake up. It's afternoon already. We're going to visit the doctor. Today's Saturday, you forgot. - Jess... - Dad... Today's Saturday. We're going to visit the doctor. If we're going to be late, the lines will be long... we're going to stay there for a long time. Today is Friday. - Saturday... - Look at the calendar. Look at it. It's too early... O... I thought it's Saturday today. Good morning. How are you, brother? - What are you sick of? - I'm having gas pains often. Please open your shirt. It's easy, you have to pray everytime. The oil, please... Father, we pray... We plead for a miracle. Heal this man's ailment. Help us, Father... OH FUCK! There are elements trying to disturb us... But remember I am still here... My father is an engineer. He built the Quirino bridge in our town. My mother works with a networking company. She sells weight loss products to people who will also sell the same weight loss products. My father works in Malaysia as a bass player for a band performing in a hotel. My mother is a... My mother is a... Dad, do mermaids catch colds? I don't think that's a real mermaid. Hey cheater, I want my money back! You can't ask for a refund. Damn it. Real mermaids don't catch colds! You already watched the show, you can't ask for a refund. I can let you in on the Human Spider. I'll call the sheriff! Wait... Here's your money. You're the one who's not fair. You already saw the show and then you demand a refund? You can't do that in a movie house! Mara, I think you should see a doctor with that cold. People are becoming suspicious that you're not a real mermaid. Can you accompany me? Oh c'mon, Mara. You know, I just can't leave the office. Why don't you ask your boyfriend to go with you. We broke up last week. He left as soon as he got his job as a seaman. What? You are really unlucky with men ...First that driver dude left you. What's his name? The driver? ...Jess. Right. Jess. And then after that episode, there was Bernard and then the married jerk, Raffy. Good thing you didn't get pregnant with this one unlike with Jess. How's your son now, Mara? He's fine. I'm picking him up later. Does Jess send you money? We broke off... before I found out I was pregnant. I don't know where the hell he is. And there's too much pride in me to look for him and ask for money. Ms. Bella, - You think guys are just after my body? - They like you for your brains. I told you, you should have brought this shirt to the cleaners. The stain won't come off. Look. Well, I'm not really fond of wearing these clothes. - Jess. - Yes? I think we should consider getting a maid. I'm getting old. I'm all alone in this house. You never know, I might have a stroke or fall down the stairs. Who will help me when you're out? Not that I'm complaining but... the household chores are too tiring for me. You speak as if you're the one doing the chores. Okay, I'll give your insulin shots. Ever since your mom passed away, I was left alone to raise you. Thanks, son. By the way... I remember... my pills for hypertension are almost gone. The doctor said I shouldn't miss my medication. You have to give me money to buy them. How much are they? A thousand pesos is okay. I can still get a discount with my senior citizen's ID. A thousand? That's too expensive. Don't worry. I'll give you the change if there's any. Can you spare me some money? - Here. - Can I still have some more? Hello? Annette. How are you? Well we're off to church, actually. Church? I thought we're watching a movie first. Remind her of my new hearing aid. Really? Oh that's great! He'll be pleased to hear that. It's a good thing you sent a new set. You know his specs anyway... Perhaps we'll get it next week. Don't worry, we'll pray that I get a US visa so that I can be with you. You have work to do? Okay. - Bye! - Hey! Are you deaf? I said-- remind her of my hearing aid. Let's go, Dad. You reap what you sow! You give loose change to God, don't complain if the blessings you get are also loose change. Now's the time God will shower us with His blessings! Amen! - Dad! - We're late. We can't find a seat. In a few moments, for those of you who wish to be healed-- The Lord will HEAL! Amen! Bring out your umbrellas! Bring out your passports! Dad! Where are you going, Dad? - Shit! I think the yams did this. I heed to dump. - But Dad the toilet is far. You want me to make a mess here? Raise your passports so that He will bless you with visas! Dad, the healing for your deafness and the passport blessing will begin in awhile. Passport? I need to dump! Dad, can't you pray over your diarrhea to stop? Praise God! Dad? Where have you been? I've been waiting here for so long. Here! Put it back! Jason! What are you doing there? I thought we agreed to meet at the school gates? Get out of there! Quick! Next time, ask permission first before you go anywhere. My friends invited me for a dip. Well, don't do that next time. - I need to pee, mom. - Okay. Now's the chance to earn just once. 10 grand for his fists to land. On your body and face right here on the perfect space. Don't let time drag and be a punching bag. So Jet's get it on. Get beat up by Lex Halcon. Go ahead and be punched. Have a knuckle sandwich for lunch 10 grand is waiting my man. Just take the money and run. I'm sorry. Where's my 10,000 pesos? 5,000? 1,000? Ouch... Mr. Sancho is on line 2... What's up, Mr. Sancho? I just want to say most Filipinos nowadays want to live abroad. Take my son, for example. One day he tells me he wants to go to the US. He never tells me about his plans. When he was young, he also didn't talk much. We even thought he was mute. And I wasn't deaf then. Old folks advised us... to feed him pig's vagina so that he'll talk. - I'm sorry but you can't say that on air. - Can't say what? - That word. - Which word? "Vagina". - It's censored? - Yes. Even if it's a pig's vagina? ...not a woman's vagina? - Even so. - What about "butt"? - It's also censored? - That one also. - What about "dick"? - Depends on how its said. - Excuse us, can we ask for directions? - Yes? Which way to Rosales town? - Rosales? - You know Rommel Aguilar's place? Oh, the visionary. Wait, I'll ask my friend. - You know where Rommel stays now? - Who? Rommel Aguilar, the visionary who saw the Virgin Mary. Here... Oh, they already passed it. They should have turned left at the gas station. - Tell them to go back. - Okay. I'll tell them... You already passed it. You should have turned left at the gasoline station. Turn right at the next corner then go straight. It's by the square. Excuse me. Can I ask... Hi handsome, need a haircut? Jason, I got a job offer in Italy to work as a maid. I might leave next month. The pay is good. At least, I can buy you lots of toys. Who's staying with me here? You can stay with Aunt Bella. I spoke to her already. They have a nice house. You'll enjoy it there. ...Okay. You know what, I think it's a bad idea. I heard it gets pretty cold up there. It's wet. Wake up, Jason, you peed on the bed. God. You're running a fever. What's happening to you? Jason wake up! Oh my God! We better go to the hospital. Dad! Hi Jess! ...1 ...] found a maid already! - What's your name again? - Umm...Nora. Wait... My chest hurts. - Help me, I can't breathe... - Dad! - Are you his son? - Yes. Did he have a heart attack? Not really. But something close to a heart attack. It's angina. He had chest pains. His arteries suddenly opened up and his blood gushed. He's wearing a nitrate patch. Was he taking anything? It's only now that he had those symptoms. He was never given any medication for "vagina". "Angina" not "vagina". I mean, was he taking anything that was not prescribed for him? - Like...? - Viagra. Viagra? I doubt it. He was probably having sex with somebody awhile ago. How does viagra look like? It's a blue diamond-shaped pill. Ma'am, is anybody from your family diabetic? Perhaps you or your parents? Maybe it's from his father's side. We tested your son's blood sugar. It's above normal. We gave him insulin but... we will teach you how and when to give him insulin next time. Here. You can buy these at the pharmacy. Mara? - Mara? - Jess? What are you doing here? A relative? My son. He has a fever. The doctors advised me to go here for the tests. A son? You have a baby? No, he's no longer a baby. He's seven. I have to buy his medicine. Seven years old? When did you get pregnant? Who's the father? - A friend. But we broke up a long time ago. - A friend? What's his name? Even if I tell you his name, you probably don't know him. How come you never told me you were pregnant? Why should I tell you? Our relationship was over long before then. Besides, I didn't even know where you were. Insulin? Your son's diabetic? Jason, this is uncle Jess. What are you doing? Nothing? I was just trying to find out what color his eyes are. Why? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? - Is Jason my son? - Of course not! My blue tablets are all gone. The magical diamond-shaped one I have to buy new pills, my son. ...Do you think I'm having fun? I have to buy new pills, my son. This pill for hypertension I was told. Never miss these when you grow old. This may not be a bitter pill to swallow when it helps a man improve his libido. I have to buy new pills, my son. Father!... Father! Dad did you take a bath today? Dad, did you take a bath today? DAD! I have my hearing aid on. You don't have to shout. You can just give me a tap. Why are you shouting? I'm watching TV. You're disturbing me! Did you take a bath today? Today's Friday. It's bad luck to take a bath on Lenten Fridays. You didn't know that? But you still eat red meat even if it is bad for you. I'm kidding, Dad. Dad, I want to ask you a favor. - What is that? - It's just a small favor. Small favor? I have this American client who's helping me get a job in the US... ...to work as a nursing aide. - As a nursing aide. - That's great. - Isn't that what you want? - Yes. Well, he's asking a small favor in return. He's asking for help. Sure. What kind of help? They're shooting something for TV. They need to shoot someone who'll have himself crucified this Good Friday. I'm thinking perhaps, you used to do it before. Maybe... You could do it again. Son, do you know why I did that before? As a sacrifice for mom to get healed? Sacrifice... for your mom. And... she got healed. But she got killed after a few years. Is there a need for sacrifice in what you are asking? Well, in exchange, there's a job for me in US. It's for our future. A better life in the US. You ask the sheriff-- He knows all the old Kristos here. But I am not going to have myself nailed on the cross again. Why? I have a different faith now. I don't believe in doing sacrifices in this manner. Every sacrifice has its price. Would you deny your son a future if all he wants is to be secure? Would you deny your only son hope? Why wouldn't a father want his son to be in the US? I'm doomed. Have pity on the old man. He's just going to do it once. And he's going to do it for our sake. I doubt it if there's a cross that can carry his weight. And he's deaf too. Maybe there are other reasons. I'll ask... Dad, why did you stop your vow of sacrifice? Your mother is still alive. She's in the US. She didn't meet an accident. She got healed... went to the US. Fell in love with somebody else... and left us. She got healed. Even if she didn't die... ...we lost her. We lost her and I lost my faith. A long time ago, penitents have their crucifixions all over town on Good Fridays. It was so chaotic. Then the tourists and the journalists came. We thought of organizing the event so that everything would be solemn, organized and peaceful for the penitents. We did the crucifixion on the hill inside a wire fence. The names of the penitents were listed and the crucifixion was done one at a time. Your father was the first, then Ambo, he's the oldest Kristo. Through time there were fewer penitents. Until a few years ago, we stopped the crucifixions altogether. Some of them had already died while the others went to Pampanga. We can talk to these guys if they can help in your filming. I started having myself nailed to a cross when... I prayed for my son's leukemia to be healed. - It's a commitment... - between me and God... And I won't allow it... I have to go to Pampanga. It will only be a show. You can film us there anyway. You need to film me? No way... I can't allow myself to be a freak show. How about some gin? Okay, I'll do it with you. But... you see, I've been doing this for years for nothing. Perhaps, I can ask for a small donation? Donation? - How much? - Well, a British TV company donated 100,000 pesos. But you're not Brits, so I guess, 50,000 pesos is okay? We found somebody who agreed to be filmed while being crucified. Finally, I'll be able to go to the US. Really? Your dream will finally come true. Nothing much is going to happen to me here. At least, in the US... I can find a decent job and send dad and Jason money. Why would you send us money? We're not relatives. Besides, I was able to raise Jason myself. We're not that desperate. Why don't you spend the night here? It's already late. I'll be fine. It's still early. I can still get to drive a guest or two. By the way, this is for Jason's insulin. Okay, bye. I'll just come back after the Holy Week. Bye. Hello? Who's this? What? It's Annette. You mean you didn't recognize my voice? Not really. It didn't have a Caller ID. What's up? How come you never calf? Do you still have plans of coming here? Of course! That's why I'm fixing my visa. What do you mean fixing? I have this client whose brother owns retirement homes in Florida. He's helping me land a job. Florida? That's in the East Coast, I live in the West. Well, it's still in the U.S. Jess, that's far! Are you serious in joining me here? Or you have someone else there in Florida, that's why it has to be in Florida. Well I didn't know they're far from each other. What's important is that I get there so we can be together. Do you feel obliged to come here? You think you can fool me? You jerk! And you prefer somebody from Florida, huh? The nerve! I have no other girl... Hello?... We might look like drug dealers... Sir, you can't smoke in here. Jess? Hi Mara, you want to visit churches tonight? Sure. Mommy, I'd like to buy popcorn. Okay. Your shoot is pushing through tomorrow? Yup, it's a go. Our producer paid already. Which means you're pushing through with your trip to the US? Most probably. Don't worry I'll write to you when I'm there. I'll buy a computer and we can chat. Jason will miss you. Really? He always talks about you with his playmates. You think Jason's father will come back for him? I don't think so. It's better he never knew his father, that way he'll never miss him. He's probably somewhere abroad right now. Ma, I need to pee. I'll go with you. - Can you write your name with your pee? - Yes. Okay, let's start #... ...A... Oops, I ran out of pee. I'll continue... O...N... - I'll go ahead. - Bye. Good Morning. - Hi! Where's Molong? - Maybe he's praying inside. Mr. Molong. Mr. Molong. - Follow him... - Mr. Molong. Mr. Molong! Mr. Molong! Hi! Where's Molong? He should be there. His lights were on this morning. Excuse me. Have you seen Molong? I think he left this morning. I saw him carrying a bag and wearing shoes. He never wears shoes unless he's leaving town. - Thanks a lot! - Okay. This is a scandal, Jess! The people have decided. Barrabbas should be freed and not the Nazarene. What punishment do you think this man... deserves for breaking the laws of the temple? Crucify him! I do not see what crime this man committed. It is the people who have decided and not me. Crucify him then! Crucify him! Are you ready? We'll do your left hand first. Do it slowly just in case I can't bear the pain. Just think of the visa. Could someone answer that. Hello?... No, I'm one of the deputies. Okay... Jess?... Well, uh... he's kinda not available right now. Well, he's... tied-up. I said TIED UP. Yes... ok... Jess, your father is asking... where you left the payment for the electricity. It's in the first drawer by my bedside. Hello?... He said it's in the first drawer by his bedside... - You have to speak louder. - THE FIRST DRAWER BY HIS BEDSIDE. Yes... bye. Turn that off. At fast, the test is over. Your crucifixion is your offer. Ouch, that hurts. Would you give your life so dearly so that you can settle in another country. Is it worth the pain when there is more to gain? Will you ever ask why? Should you stake your life... and die? Will you ever ask why? - 1 ticket please... - Okay. 1 ticket... 30 pesos only. Okay thanks. Okay go in. Mara! Mara! - Jess! - I have a visa! They gave me a visa! I can leave soon and go to the States! Dad, Annette and I will meet in Florida. She says she'll try to look for a hospital to work in... so that we can be together. Dad, don't forget to wear your hearing aid when I'm gone. Your insulin... Your vitamins... Dad, I'll leave you my cellphone. I'll tell you when I'm sending money. Dad Dad The dining hall is over there. Your room is on the next floor. You will be staying with Mr. Nato. Mr. Nato, I'd like you to meet Mr. Sancho Huson. Good afternoon. Jess, I need to talk to you. Can I move somewhere else? That dog's going to croak soon. Dad, we can't do that. You're the one who chose this place. Now it's my fault? As if I have a choice. Well, you don't want to stay with your sister, do you? C'mon. My sister might expire sooner than I would. I don't like her bratty kids to look after me. Well, I guess, this is goodbye. My flight is on Saturday. Bye. Go. I'll be fine. - Where to? - North to Caloocan. No, we're going south to Las Pinas. No, to Caloocan. To Las Pinas! Sir, we can take your wife first to where she wants? No, we're not going to Las Pinas. So, are you going to your mother again? You said you broke off with Lorraine and now she's sending you text messages? That was from Lorenzo, a client. Not Lorraine! A client who sends a message saying "CALL ME NOW"? ...followed by A Smiley face! At this hour? I'm sure it's an alias. - Driver, we're going south. - Driver, take us to Caloocan. Las Pinas. Hello? Mara? T's Annette. Hi Annette. How are you? Who's Mara? Oh nothing. She's a... she's our dispatcher. Why did you call? What do you mean why did I calf? You're expecting a call from Mara? No, I'm just on my way to Caloocan. Las Pinas! Who's that? Ah... er... a passenger. Passenger or Mara? Why is she listening to our conversation if she's a passenger? Is she the one from Florida? Listen, Annette. I'm going to Florida because that's where Mara... ...er... I mean my client lives. See, you even get tongue-tied because the bitch is with you! We agreed to... ...we will meet in Florida. Right? Annette, you're the only one I love. Son of a bitch! We agreed to... Hello?... Where to again? - Caloocan. - Las Pinas! ENOUGH! We'll go to Caloocan first! Then if you decide to go to Las Pinas then we'll go there! You keep on shouting. We'll go to Caloocan first! If you're the father would you leave your son? If you're the son would you leave your father? Godspeed on your journey but are you avoiding responsibility? There is no doubt you look so alike. Your eyes, your mouth, the way you rub your nose. From head to toe, there is no question... You're the only son of Sancho Huson. - Sorry. - Yuck! So are you ready to leave your father and your son Jason? What time is your flight on Saturday? 9:35 p.m. You should be at the airport by 7:30. - When will you return the car to Mr. Sammy? - Tomorrow morning. Good evening, Mr. Sancho. What's up? Good evening, Mr. Gerry. I just wish to say that there are things in this world that we take for granted ...and we only realize their value when they're gone. We take them for granted when we see them everyday. But once they're gone... Take my son, for example... He's probably in the US by now. He's a nursing aide in Florida... There are so many things I wanted to tell him. But he's gone... I always believe... You'll know what kind of father you have been... by the way your son becomes. Jess... He's a good son. I'm an old man... but nobody beats Jess... with the way he takes care of me. ...I miss my son. Where to? Where to again? Don't you know where it is? You mean Glorietta? "Your mother is still alive". She ran off with an American ...And she left us". There's one thing I wanted to say... Hello?... Shit! The line's been cut. Good thing, you've come to visit me. - I'm not visiting you. I'm picking you up. - We're going home? Yep, but first we'll have to pick up a mermaid and her son. My father is the best driver in the whole world. And my mother is the most beautiful mermaid in the whole world.
