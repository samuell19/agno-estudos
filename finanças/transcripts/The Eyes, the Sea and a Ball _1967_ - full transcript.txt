Ah right. We're coming. He was a good teacher, eh? - Right. Hurry. There's teacher's now. Oh, teacher. Otsu-san... thanks for all your help. Not at all. You're leaving? - Yes. Sorry to leave... but he's been admitted to Marugame high school. Good Kenbo. - You're very lucky. You're leaving us to go to highschool. I'll be back again. We look forward to it. - Good. Please go ahead. - Right. Since teacher came... how long is it? - Let's see... Twelve or thirteen years. He's a good man. - His wife too. - Really good. He worked hard for us on this island. - That's right. Also he paid more tax than us. Look at yourself. You got more responsible thanks to teacher Ieda. You're an idiot! You gave him the most trouble. You fool! My tattoo says... "like plovers on the waves." (In harmony with nature.) Your's is a blowhard, a whale's water spout. Until 10 years ago even Kohei's father... was such a roughneck nobody could handle him. He was fighting endlessly, day and night. Didn't you used to knock your wife around? But I submit to her now. Since now she heads the women's club. Teacher's coming. He's coming. Executive Producer: YASUE Shigeyoshi Film Processing: Toyo Film Labs Editor: SUGIHARA Yoshi Asst.

LOVELY FLUTE AND DRUM ( Natsukashi fue ya taiko ) STARRING OUZORA Mayumi NATSUKI Yosuke FUJIWARA Kamatari KOSAKA Kazuya URABE Kumeko ENDO Tatsuo, YAMAMURA Kozo, KITAMO Tadaichi SHIMA Yasuhiko, TANIGUCHI Hiroshi Written and Directed by: KINOSHITA Keisuke FEBRUARY 1954 (Showa 29 February) Marugame City, Shikoku Waiting long? The boat was slow. Was it rough? - Yes. What on earth were you thinking, writing like that? I was shocked. Anyway, let's go to my place. I'm sorry... for telling you so suddenly. And your father and mother, what did they say? How can I say? "Do what you want." - Then what should we do? You just taught for a year stuck on that island. I understand you're only half done. That means... you're saying you want us to cancel our engagement. No... I'd rather not cancel. If I go to the island school... even if we married we couldn't... That's why I told you not to go. Still you applied and went. As I explained before... - That's not you're responsibility. Just because he jumped to death in the sea... you shouldn't have to take care of his child? It beggars understanding. So we marry after another year. But it's all your fault applying for that remote posting. It's even smaller and more difficult than the island I'm on. There isn't even a regular boat. If I want to meet you on weekends, it won't always be possible. It felt like you wrote to cancel our marriage. You may feel so. I too feel bad, but what can I say? Is a battlefield comrade so important to you? On top of which, he never paid back all your loans. It caused me trouble too, as you know. I apologize. As you can see. It's sure... you're definitely going? You find another man's child more attractive than me? No? Attractive I can't say. It's just that... I feel sorry for the man who died. - But... you've already done all you could. No... not enough. We faced war and death together on the battlefield. His parents dead, the child is crying all alone. I have no choice but to go. - Is it? So that's what a man is, is it? Well... man or woman... it's how a human is. "How futile this." "A small cloud in an empty sky." "The rain already knows what's intended." Go. - Yeah. Go. - Yeah. Thanks. - You're pretty late. I didn't realize this boat... won't go for just one passenger. That's so... for the boat coming here. Because of all my baggage they finally agreed to leave. - Oh. Hey. These are your new teacher's things. Give teacher a hand. They all ran away. That's our island kids, no? Eh, this steep path is hard going. - Right. Young. - Handsome, eh? That one's short, no? Where are they? Move a little. What are you saying? We're almost there. - Thank you. We should be thanking you for coming here. This island being so remote. Still no other teachers yet? They don't return until just before school starts. They prefer to stay with their families. - Thanks. I wanted time to get to know the place. I'm sorry that it means more work for you. No, principal asked me to help you. Let's go. Right. Ooh... what a great view. When the weather's nice, it's really fine. When it's windy, it really howls up here. How many stay in this house? All except principal, who rents a house just below here. So all the other teachers are here. The head teacher has his own room. Two lady teachers share a room. And teacher Otsuka will share with you. Is that so? I think I'll stay here for some time. Look out for me. Well, we'll see. Most teachers barely manage the first two years. Let's go down for another load. - Right. Do you know Choichi's house? No, I don't know their house. My late war buddy's wife was from that family. Oh, like that. So Choichi's younger sister was your war buddy's wife. Yes. - Anyway... they say... he did something bad, that is... he jumped from the Takimatsu ferry. Died that way... or so I heard. Also Choichi's younger sister... came back with their baby. But she passed away after a sudden illness. The mourning grandma... was left to care for the baby. I'll try to visit after a while. Is it far? There's no near or far here. All the way round the island, is only 4 kilometers. Let's go. Can I ask you something? Are those the homes of west hill? - What? Mr. Choichi's house, which one is it? Choichi's house is where I live. So you're the grandma? - Yes. I'm the new school teacher, Ieda. Mr. Hayashi told me about your family. You're the teacher. Oh well. Thanks for coming. How is your grandchild? Well, he needs a lot of care. Is he at home now? - Yes, he is. Then could I see him a minute? - That's our house there. You'll find it easily. You'll hear Kenbo crying as you go. Then... I'll go there. - Right. Excuse me. Only there's nobody home. Oh, nobody at all? They're all out on the fish boats. So the baby's alone? What can I do? To carry him up this steep slope at my age is too hard. I'll go see. Kenbo... You're a good boy, Kenbo, right? From now on... uncle's love is here for you. There, there, there! Kenbo's good. Even though your mom and dad aren't here... uncle will give you lot's of love. And bring you up a good boy. There, there. Good boy. Poor fellow, left all alone. Well, well, don't cry. Don't cry... eh. Good, good. "Farewell Rabaul, until we meet again." "My cheeks are wet, my tears keep running down." "Longing memories of my beloved, and those lovely coral isles." "Behind the coconut fronds, the Southern Cross shines." Wait. - Help me! Killer, murderer. Somebody help. Someone's shouting "killer". - Happens regularly. You say "regularly"... but it's a woman's voice. Even a dog wouldn't take it. Teacher, help me. Wait. Wait, stop right now. Teacher! Teacher, please kill this idiot! Get out of here. Oh, that hurts. "This is a pen." "This is a book." "This is a pencil." "This is a map." Yasuaki! Oh, Yasuaki! Come on. We're taking a trip. Where to? - Fool! Shut up and come with me. Get away you fool. - What about mom? Fool! Your mom's thrown us out and ran away to Marugo. What's happened to you? I am... Fear me. I'm with the whale gang. Eh, this island bores me now. I'm not leaving because of her. I'm taking this kid. Come on then, get going. Dad, Dad. Brat. Come on. ODESHIMA JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL (ODESHIMA JHS) Okay? Don't start from the outset thinking that you'll fail. This year whatever we'll win. Let's think like that. Okay? Understand? You lack confidence. Are you ready to really give it your all? Don't you want to carry the winner's flag once? You'll never win with these sleepy faces. Hey, look! That school also came. They've got three boats. Which island are they from? They're in good spirits. They've got a leg up on us already. They filled three boats and are full of confidence. Compared to them... our only supporters are granny and Kenbo. What do our people think of their children? Over the years have they never won? Well, today you'll see. Anyway, if someone's running last, people say, "Oh, must be Odeshima." Hey... if you can't win don't come last. Right. Such a spiritless answer, all of you. Say yes, say yes. It's impossible. - Hey, what's impossible? Ya, it might be impossible. Our sports ground is very small. A little island, all hillsides. Up hill or down hill... they're always running. Never straight or on the level, you know. But all the islands have only limited flat land. But a totally different temperament. - What? We're the smallest Shiwaku island, people feel small. Early in the Meiji period they migrated from other islands. And no money either. Sitting between Shikoku and Honshu they feel intimidated, no? Odeshima's pulling up the rear! Hey, shout something back you guys. Like what? Can't you even keep up? What a pathetic outlook. Give them a mouthful. Idiots, fools. Anything that comes to mind. Come on. "Clam, clam, what are you doing?" (bakagai=local clam. Lit. stupid clam) "Fool, fool, foolish bird." (ahou=fool, ahouduri=fool bird=albatross) "Yesterday, today, you always cry out loud." "Tomorrow you'll be just an empty shell." "Fool, fool, foolish bird, stupid shell." Losers! Losers! SHIWAKU ISLAND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL (JHS) SPORTS FESTIVAL Ready! Poor boy. He fell. He's from Odeshima? No doubt from Odeshima. Go hard. Go hard. Ready! Not again. - What d'you mean 'again'? Must be Odeshima... coming last. Ready! Come on Odeshima boy, Try hard, try hard. Ready! Go for it! - Try hard. Go for it! Go for it! What's Odeshima doing? Again Odeshima coming last. Go hard. Do your best. Ieda-san. Are your leaving? No, I'm buying sweets for the kids. It's good you give them something. It's all they'll get... Odeshima. That's not what I meant. So... buy something you like. Granny, you get some too. You put yourself out to come. - Okay. Kenbo... shall I buy something for you too. Ieda-san. - What? You're taking full care of the baby... hard work, no? Not really. He's so cute. What's his name? - He's Kenbo. Kenichi... Hayashi Kenichi. Because of this Kenichi-kun I've faced a lot of trouble. You haven't had much trouble yet. Why? Next year it all depends on you. Either you come to Odeshima, or I come to Marugame Saturdays. - Who said so? Otherwise it won't work. What's so great about "last place" Odeshima? You're a big loser. What...? Damn it! They're too full of themselves. You'll see. I'll make us winners no matter what. I swear it! I won't accept that Kenbo's people are losers. You say you're going to train them up. How can you on such a small ground? No way you can except make them run all day. When I came to teach here... I brought a half dozen baseballs. I never hoped they'd really learn. I didn't even dream of it. Every single ball ended up in the sea. One, two, three... arms up and down, is all they know, right? I tried to get them to play 'kibasen'. They ran so fast they overshot the playground. Took me totally by surprise. They rolled down the hill in a ball. Luckily they hung up on a pine tree. What do they do at night? With just a lamp like this they can't study. You don't know? What? So the principal didn't tell you? Again! - Right. No, don't go. It's not a good time. Kids gambling is no good. It's dangerous. - I don't care. Anyway... these island guys, almost all, are bad tempered, no? Don't they care about their children's future? No use thinking like that. In any case... the population of the island... is just over 300. And half of them are children. All the more reason to care for them. They give them saké and teach them to gamble. At the time of the squid fishery... seasonal workers from Osaka... are brought in to help out. They teach young people, even children their ways. Even so, I'm shocked. You have a hard task, eh. It's a big one, that bandage you're wearing. What did you buy in Marugame? It's too early for watermelon. It's a ball... a volley ball. What kinda ball? Good. This isn't hard. Don't complain, just catch it cleanly. Put some effort into it. It's boring, no? Why do we have to do it? Hey, where are you looking? Rock, scissor, paper. Rock, scissor, paper. Ball games aren't popular here. These islanders... I can't understand either parents or kids. Yesterday and today, two third graders were absent. You know why? Weren't they out on the fish boats? No, no. Because they lost at cards... they had to work to cover their debts. Adults and kids, who knows how they think. Well then. These kids like to compete and win. Why not make teams and let them compete? True but... without a net how can they compete? I'll ask the principal. Are you guys motivated or not? Even if I train you hard... it's you who have to do the work. Every year they shame you at the meet. You're the ones who feel humiliated. No... actually it's not only you. The whole island gets laughed at. "Odeshima always comes last." You okay with that? Doesn't it make you want to win? First of all, being so timid isn't good. Kids should be kids. More lively and cheerful. You get it? If you do, say so! Yes. What a dull response. Then... let's start. Teacher... do we have to come on Sunday too? Good. Tomekichi speaks his mind. Good students don't take Sundays off. Start! Tomekichi, here. Screw it! Good afternoon. What's up? You here? "What's up" isn't very welcoming. All this way? Yes... I came. I didn't come to enjoy the view. Anyway... shall we go to my room? Yes. I want to see what your room's like. Thanks. So... I came to ask once again... have you really decided to stay on such an island? Even this island... once you settle, is home, right. How can you say that, with only lukewarm water to drink? The general store in the harbour... stocks soda. I'll get some? - No need. Please sit down. But... you said the water's not good. I'm patient. I'll manage. That's good. After all it was your idea to come. That's just mean. We meet after so long and that's all you can say? In the first place, aren't you happy to see me? When you were at Marugame school... do you know how I felt on the boat? I just kept feeling that I had to see you every Saturday. Really? "Having lived... to meet you I was content." "But now I think of the regrets in my heart." "My love knows not it's destination Neither it's end." "Only being with you now is all I know." Is that right? What's right about it? You never take me seriously. For me it's complicated. How is it complicated? It's very simple. Either you want to marry or you don't, no? I've said enough. I've nothing more to say about it. But that's why I came to see you. - Keep you voice down! Even if I shout nobody will hear me. You're the only one who stays here on Sundays. I don't understand you. Sorry. Here. Give this to your cute Kenbo. I'm sure you don't get books and toys here. I bought some sweets too. It cost me 500 yen. Thank you. It'll make Kenbo happy. Ieda-san... - What? Making Kenbo happy is a good thing. But what about me? Two more years. One more year. It's like counting reeds in a mat. I was looking forward to a happy future with you. Where are you going? Let's go out. It's getting too serious in here. But this is a serious topic. Surely you're not saying that it's not serious? Men can be carefree and take their time. A woman faces a fixed timetable. In that case why don't you get married? To whom? To me. So then... you intend to marry me? - Yes. For sure. Really? It's for sure? I was beginning to feel that it wasn't that important to you. In which case... for another half year... you work at Marugame school. Then we'll get married. So... you'll come to work in Marugame too? Not like that. I'll come every Saturday to see you in Marugame. So then what happened to "for sure"? So we're back to square one? - How so? We'll still get married. - I can't agree. So from the start you planned to live apart. Then where on earth will we start a family? Please... don't raise your voice. - There's nobody here. There are... there... many. I'm... leaving. Michiko... First you have to really want it. So get practicing. The last time Kenbo's father came to borrow money... looking back he was in desperate need. His private betting shop was failing. Without 50,000 yen the court would get involved. He was running everywhere trying to borrow money. But he had borrowed too much, so no chance. In the end he came back to me... crying the blues. He wanted me to call home and somehow get 50,000. It pissed me off. It was just too many times. On top of that... I felt he had come to the point of abusing our friendship. Moreover... that much would only cover outstanding debts. Private betting shops are illegal anyway. I flatly refused him. So that evening... it seems he decided to flee to the mainland. But on the ferry... he must have felt helpless, and despaired. So he ended it there. If, at that time, I had been kinder... - No, no. You did everything humanly possible. No, it wasn't enough. I felt I couldn't afford to lose more to him. I was his last hope. But listen Ieda-san... because of that, should you waist your life here? No, its no sacrifice. I'm doing it for my own satisfaction. And for that reason you would give up marrying me? Firstly... whether you stay on this island or not... it won't change the fact that Kenbo will grow up. All you can do is give him pocket money, and carry him around once a day, no? That's no reason to stay on this island. Michiko-san... let's do this. For now I'm responsible... to teach these children... to have courage and confidence. Please wait 'til then. And when will that be? Till we win at sports. When we win the prefecture... or at least the Shiwaku Islands level. Well... how long will that take? Is it possible for "always last" Odeshima? Don't say that. You also spent 500 yen for someone else's child. I always knew you were a good person. You are like this flower. Don't they use its scent in mosquito coils? So... that's how. But... that's not easily done here. Right, Kenbo? Here it comes. Okay, I've got it. Good. Alright, alright. Everyone, tie it tightly. Tea time soon. Teacher, save me. Teacher, help me. Stop! Hey you wait. Teacher, please help. What's the matter? Oi... Najibo. Come here. Don't be crazy. You're the crazy one. What's the trouble? - This is none of your business. I'll get you. - Why are you getting so violent? Hey, out of my way! - What did he do? You bugger... you want tax from me? How will we pay? - But it's tax. You think it's normal to pay tax? Come out front. - Wait! Wait! You're a pain. Move! But it's tax isn't it? - What good is it? This man's nothing but a thief. Teacher... what can I do? Wait! Wait. Teacher! Teacher! Wait you! We'll come again soon. Please win the volleyball game. We'll come to cheer. Goodbye. - Goodbye. (Multiple goodbyes and well wishes.) Stay well. (multiple times) Are you going away next year coach? If you lose again... then maybe I'll go. And if we win? If you win I'll stay forever. And train you very hard! Then... we better not win. - Naughty boy! Coach can't fool these kids. What a shame. - Coach, you should take a holiday. I don't care. I don't like lazy kids. - We don't like Coach's training. Hey, to the sports ground and line up! Line up! Hit it well. Move up more quickly. Strong defense! Umeko... move quicker. Catch it nicely. Good. Well done. Ready? That's it. Good, good. Good. Kenbo you'll be a good player. The big kids haven't come back... must be too exhausted. Ah, well done. Oi, do your best. Our big test... is only a month away. This one won't be unlike other tournaments. All the Shiwaku high schools will be in Marugame. Of course... It'll be the first time we'll be competing at volleyball. For you guys all the teams will be strong. But no need to be afraid. So far you've all tried hard and paid attention. I know you can win! Maybe not the final, but at least one or two games. To lose the first match is unforgivable. Don't laugh. A win... will show Odeshima's strength. That's right. Don't you agree. Yes. - I agree. That's right. Do it with that spirit. So then today, let's decide who will go. But... those who aren't chosen... train as if you were playing... and support them with all you've got. So... those whose names I call come forward. Yes! Starting nine: OKURA Tomekichi - Yes. OKURA Saburo - Yes. OKURA, Kohei - Yes. So many Okuras, I'll use first names. - Yes. Taro - Yes. Yutaka - yes. Haruko - Yes. Umeko - Yes, but I'm not an Okura. Right. But that's okay. Next is Hanako. - Which Hanako is it? Ah, I see. South village OKURA Hanako. - Yes. OKURA Kyoko - Yes. HIGASHI Bakuda - Yes. These nine... will be our starters for now. The rest of you... are substitutes, practice hard and be ready. Yes. Next year you graduate. Maybe you can work in Okayama. Now is when you can help your mom and dad. Later you won't get the chance. Stupid game hitting a ball... waste of time. So after school... you come straight home. I'm a starter. I have a responsibility. That's crazy... leave it to someone else. Not one yen for busting your butt. You're a fool! A woman should work hard. If she doesn't, no one will marry her. Forget all this school stuff. Coach said... we'll uphold the island's honor. Don't talk nonsense. Honor won't fill your belly! School is for study. It won't help you get food will it? Come straight home and help out. What else is there? You eat plenty. Costs a lot. Your parents fish far out? - Yes. Where is he usually... this little one. Mom takes him to fish on her back. Why is he with you today? She said, sometimes stay home and help your mom. All this... teacher only does it not to be bored. Keep being foolish, you'll be hungry. But if I quit it'll be bad for everyone. That's not your problem. Anyway you won't win any games. He said this time we'll definitely win. The seagulls will laugh at you. Even if the sea dries up, it won't happen. If you want to go to Osaka next year you have to work and build your strength now. That's why I'm playing sports. - Foolish boy! Using your strength without earning is just stupid. Kohei... Carrying fertilizer's tough work. Your dad hit you last night, eh? - Yes. Is he at home now? Out to sea? - He went to the temple. Oh... that's great. He went to pray. - Not that. No? - Something bigger. Bigger... what's that? - It's understood. Oh... gambling. He couldn't find enough cash so he whacked Mom and left. You see... in this part... the author achieved a big effect with a small expression. For example, what Anju did... he didn't explain in detail... by using emotive words, for example... Teacher Ieda. Just now a troublesome call came in. - What is it? It seems next volleyball tournament they won't allow a mixed team. Why's that? The Educational Council informed us. That's crazy. We have to follow the rules. - There's no such rule. No matter what you... - I'll fight it. But who will you fight? I'll go to every councilor’s house. There's no ferry for 2 days. I'll find a boat. Mr. Simula... Why can't our team compete in the Tournament. How is our application invalid? I know nothing about it. Your principal's the Vice President? - That's so. Is he in now? - He is. Right. I'll see him. You may say so, but... I know a rule's a rule. But there are unique situations. As Vice President you understand... the nature of Odeshima... and its school. Among our students... how many boys and how many girls. We can't build a team of only boys... or only girls either. It isn't possible. I'm aware of that. But make an effort. Avoid mixing girls. Then we'll lose. You're used to losing, no? - What did you say?! Now, now. I understand how you feel. Please. Make Odeshima an exception. Just for this tournament. Otherwise I pity the children. They've worked so hard. If they can't compete now, they'll lose all confidence. Please. Council President... MARUGAME CITY Please... Just this once make an exception. But then... if we make an exception here any school can demand the same. Such a crazy thing would never happen. In 3rd year at Odeshima we have only 8 boys and girls in total. And only 6 in 2nd year. So how can we make an all boys team? Is there another such school? It's because of that... this kind of school in our tournament just isn't practical. It's utterly impractical, no? - Impractical? Odeshima's children aren't practical. They're excluded; too weak, stay out. Then how will these children grow? What a problem. A problem? It's a problem they can't attend A problem... I'll try to discuss it. Please. If I don't get a good answer... I'm ready to stay here. Actually... I can't show my face to the children. Ah well... you have a real way with words. I'm speechless. I beg you. Teacher Ieda... Teacher Ieda... (repeats over and over) Thank you teacher. Thank you. Teacher. Teacher. Hard working coach. Welcome Back. Thank you. Thanks for your hard work. Welcome Back. It worked. They gave permission. Hurray! - Hurray! One-two, one-two. Put more energy into it. A little higher. Move up... That's it. How dare you. Do like that. Stop that! - Dad, let me go! Useless girl. Come home and help. - Dad. Chioko, come on. Hurry up! Dad, let me go. One less and we'll lose. So stupid. Come back and help out. Chioko, come. Dad... Dad! Tell me... why'd you miss two days. Kohei... you won't answer teacher? You're a team member... important to our team. Not many days to go now. If you can't come, it's a problem for everyone. If you don't come, we might lose. Dad said, "Don't go to school. It's okay." What? Enough playing with balls. Work at home. Really he said that? Self-study. Behave yourselves. Hey... place bets. That's too bad. - Damn. What do you want, teacher? I want to make a request. Ohh... in this rain? Let's share a glass. You may know... the tournament's in a few days. Oh... tournament... what's that? I asked you before... about Kohei. Oh... hitting the ball. For a few more days I'd ask you not to stop him. I don't know about that. Oh... where were we. Father. - Shut up! You're disturbing me and spoiling my luck. Don't you all want us to win? Don't you want to see your sons win? What?! You useless jerk! - Idiot! Let's go! I'll thump you. Come on! Okay then. Come on! Give up! ( Marugame castle and battlements ) SHIWAKU REGIONAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL (JHS) VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT KAMBESHIMA JHS OKAGESHIMA JHS MAGOMESHIMA JHS ODESHIMA JHS Try hard. - Do your best! Play hard! Mr. Ieda. I'll pray for your win. - Thank you. Please take a seat. - Excuse me. If I still taught at a small island... I'd have to cheer against your team. It's good I changed to Marugame. For us our fate rests on this tournament. You have to win here. - We'll make the semis for sure. Please listen to a few words from our tournament president. This year, Showa 30 (1955)...

At this time... we will start the tournament. Now... the first game: Odeshima JHS versus Magomeshima JHS... bow. We're honored. (All together) Captains... Rock, paper, scissors. Everyone...

My head is full of thoughts. It's amazing. My war buddy lost in life and died... After that, a guy went to his island ready to die. How is it I feel so good today? "Bakagai, bakagai, what is it?" (Type of clam. Lit. crazy clam) "Fool, fool, foolish bird." (ahoudori Lit. foolish bird=Albatross) "Pecking, pecking... what is it you say?" "Papa and mama... are no longer there." "Fool of a crazy clam..." "crying here like this." It's good I decided to come. I'm glad to be with you when you are so happy. I am happy. When we are really happy we want someone next to us. Not just somebody. Then... our promise is good? Promise? They won. So you can come back to Marugame next march, right? No... you promised me. You women can't understand. What's that? How can I just drop Odeshima. You only think of yourself. You don't feel for others. Liar. Head strong. Why did I come on this boat? You want to go back, go. Oh... those are island boats. Island boats! Oi! Everyone get up. Get up! Ahoy! Ahoy! What? They are island boats. After I called they must've decided to meet us. They are flying the "big catch" flag. We got no send-off. Now a big welcome? I knew it, island boats. Hey, everyone... get up! Ahoy! Thank you! Thank you! We won. Dad, we won. Mom, we won! Dad! - Mom! Mom! Dad! We are the best! I won too! They did their best! Thank you. This time they didn't crush us!
