God, you are so beautiful. Jesus. You're actually gorgeous, though. I'm older than you. You know that, right? I don't know. - I mean, I don't know. - Come on! But it doesn't even matter because you're a guy, so, your average conquest is... what, half my age? Sure. Well, actually, it's two girls half your age. But this just seemed more convenient. Listen, you don't wanna go fishing around in my sordid past right now. - Hmm. - Ya don't wanna do that. Mm-mm. No, I don't. Oh, no, I scared you there, didn't I? No, I'm not a murderer or a pedophile - or anything like that. - Wonderful. Ah, I'm spoiling the mood already, aren't I? No. No, no, no. It... It's just weird, isn't it? It's really weird. Chemistry is weird. Because... because I feel like I got fucking smashed on some really strong cocktails. But instead of having a hangover, I feel like... like fucking Superman. You know? I feel like... Look at those big man muscles. Do you want some water? I'm just gonna get a glass of water. I think you'd have to get the fire department to pull me out of this bed. What, the Jaws of Life? Hey, have you ever seen them use that thing before? - It's pretty amazing. - No, I've not. Yeah, there was a big wreck outside the restaurant last year. Actually, it was, uh, quite horrifying, to tell you the truth. But, um, they did manage to save the one young woman. I don't even like this bed. I keep saying I need to get another bed. Huh? Do you like the bed? Ah, I'm biased. You know, for me, it's like a... like a taxi to paradise. - You have to work today? - No. Well, I do. But I do have a couple of hours, and, um... hey, I'm the boss, so, I can do what I want. I can call in sick. Call in horny. Ooh. No, don't call in horny. Okay. Okay. So, two thoughts. We can make love, or we can make breakfast. And you should know, I'm a fucking amazing cook. How... how do you know they saved the woman? The what? Um... you mean, the fire department? Um, I don't really know. I mean, I think it was a successful extraction. They definitely took her away in an ambulance, and I heard someone whoop and cheer. I mean, I didn't follow them to the ER, but it looked like everything was going according to plan over there. What caused the accident? The ac... I don't know. I think it was a drunk. I mean, and not from my place, thank God. The girl was drunk, or the person driving - was drunk? - I don't... I don't know who was in the other car. And whatever was going on over there wasn't nearly as dramatic. I'm just really sorry I fucking brought this up, because this has to be the least sexiest conversation - we could possibly be having. - No, see, you have to work. And so we need... we need this transition, okay? So, go, go and make some coffee or something. Yeah. Uh... yeah. Look, I'm all distracted with you prancing around here, okay? - So... - I'm prancing? Okay. Or whatever the manly word is for... for driving a woman crazy with desire, so... Okay. Ah, you... boy, you've... you really never have been with a woman your age before, have you? I mean, this is, uh... um... a little privacy, you know? I mean, I know you saw the whole thing, but that was another context. This is... this, is, uh... Yeah, middle- aged woman, broad daylight, yeah. And now you can go down to the kitchen and get a big knife to murder me with. Hey, if I was a serial killer, wouldn't I have killed you already? Yeah, but how would you do it? Turn around! Um... I would slice your heart out and eat it. But, uh... I don't know. It's so strange that that's where your mind went. - You are a weird one. - I know, I know. I just have a natural tendency to... - Oh, right. - Yeah. That would be your business, isn't it? Blood and guts. Hmm, it's not really, but, you know, I just... I try to pay attention. I like the details. Well, you know, me being me, I'd, uh, cook your chopped out heart. I would roast it with some shallots and maybe a balsamic glaze. Well, leave it juicy and rare. Rare heart. Yes, the rarest. Come on, put your pants on. Yes, ma'am. So, when should we see each other again? Any time. I could call you or I could text you. You could pop by the restaurant whenever. Or, I don't know... look, if I'm allowed to visit you - at the hospital. - Clinic. Yeah, no, but... no, no, I know. But that's not really what I'm saying. See, I, uh... I... Oh, man, I don't even know what the... - You know. - I don't even know - what the rules are anymore! - Doesn't matter. My place is, uh... is public anyhow, so anybody is welcome. You're public. No. Yes. But you are especially welcome is what I'm saying. In a few days, tonight, I would love to see you again anytime. I mean, aren't you a little afraid of fucking this up? I mean, come on, man. Hmm? - No. - Why not? Well, we just started. And, um... I don't know. Uh, I'm an idiot. I'm a man. I, uh... I like you. That's it. It's, uh... You ever played sports? Yeah, I was on the volleyball team. Oh, of course, you were. Of course, you were! God, I would love to see you in those little shorts. - I don't have those anymore. - I will get you a pair. I will. But you know, like, "One game at a time." You've heard that, right? You can't go into it thinking about losing because that's a recipe for choking, right? I like your confidence. Well, you were very confident last night. No, no. That was just a low bullshit tolerance. Because I'm old and cranky. I... That's not the same as confidence. Last night? Last night, yeah. Well, I'm not normally like that, I... I trusted you. I don't know. You just... you seemed to have a natural... Idiocy. Yeah. Women find that comforting. - No, no, no. No. - Dunno why. I mean, you... you're kind. I saw the way you treated everyone around you, and how they treated you. I was trying to impress you. I really wanted to impress you. - Well, good timing. - Good timing. - Stop repeating me. - Sorry. I'll tell you one thing about timing. And, um... I mean, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I mean, let's not. But maybe we're just a couple of people with maybe imperfect records who have found each other at exactly the right moment? I... I don't know. And maybe this is a paradox, but I actually think, you know, because people our age, they have baggage, yeah? They have so much baggage. But see, me, I am such a colossal fuckup that I have hardly managed to pick up any baggage. I mean, it's like the bags just kept going past me on the conveyor belt, and I just didn't pick the fucking things up! Does that make sense? No. Um... Well, that concludes this episode of Serious Talk. I just... I just mean, of course, I want to see you again. I can think of at least 40 other ways I really wanna make love to you. And even if this turns out to be the only connection, I just think, I don't know... it... you just... I just think it's fantastic and wonderful to be able to feel like this. Much better than volleyball. Please tell me if I'm digging myself a grave here. Because I have been known, you know, to put the suit on, dive right in there, - and read my own eulogy... - No. I like what you have to say. Oh, shit. You're the serial killer. Is that it? Come on then. Come on. Come and show me. If you think you're so bad... ...come and I don't know, fucking... what are you gonna do, put a pillow on my face? Just keep talking. You're beautiful. You're warm and you're brilliant. And all of that is just fucking obvious to anyone who's halfway paying attention. - Do you believe me? - Sure. No, fuck that. - Do you believe me? - No. But not because I don't want to. Do you fucking believe me, - for Christ's sake? - Yes, fine! Yes! Yes? - Yes. - Good. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, my God, wait. I do. I do have to go in to work today. My boss, she arranged this special... ...it's like a special - training session. God. - Yeah, no problem. Are you late? No, no, no. I'm not late. No. I just... I just... Oh, this was... this was so, so nice. And I'm gonna come visit you. I'm gonna barge in on you at work and I'm gonna embarrass you, okay? You know, there's this new girl, this... this young girl, and the... and the truth is, we... we never should have hired her - in the first place, you see? - Uh, yeah. Because... because she's not... she's not qualified. But she's... she's sweet. I mean... I mean, she means well, but she, oh, she just needs a lot of supervision. So, I've kinda gotta get, you know, remedial with her, try to get her up to speed. - Yeah. - I mean... I could... I could... I could never kill you by putting a pillow over your face because you'd fight me off with the big muscles, so, that's a ridiculous idea. Well, we'll have to resume that discussion later, hey? I'd have to tie you to the bed first. - Huh! - You'd probably be fine with that, I imagine. You're sending some mixed signals here. Am I really? Yeah. I don't want to leave either, you know? - I really don't. - No, you should. You should. You have to. This is getting ridiculous now. Do you know what, I'm gonna rip off the band- aid and run away, because I can do that. Okay. But this certainly isn't goodbye, so... Can you look at me? I was so happy. I mean, I was bursting with happiness. And I don't know what it was. It was like the way the... the light came in the window, or I don't know but, all of a sudden, I had a panic attack. - And this man had to leave. - Hmm. And, I mean, he was getting ready to go anyway. I mean, he had to go to work for real. I mean, at least, I think for real. Maybe he was just trying to get away from me too, and... No, he liked you. You liked each other. Yeah. That's good. And, you know, you can't second guess. - I... I sounded crazy. - Well, men love crazy. - And you didn't, I'm sure. - No, I, um... No, he was telling this story about this drunk girl that got in a car accident outside his place, and I took that girl from his story and in my imagination, in my crazy head, I said that I had to go give her training at work. Probably because I wanted to call you and beg you to come talk to me. So, I was the crazy girl. Yeah. Well, it felt really good. He felt good. Okay, come on. What are we doing here? I mean, I'm not one of your girlfriends. I'm your friend but... why are we here? Well... he made me feel like anything was possible. Mm-hmm. And I know that anything is not possible. Mm-hmm. - But amidst everything, there was a thought flickering across my mind that... that maybe I could have a drink. That, you know, it wouldn't matter. That's a classic. - I mean, sneaky one. - Yeah, I guess. I guess it's kind of obvious. It was a first for me, though. Well, bless you, but that's like the most normal, common, garden variety alcoholic magical thinking ever. - Yeah. Textbook, right? - Yeah. But, I mean, you had your own feeling about it. And, look, by the way, this has nothing to do with whether or not you're in love. I mean, I certainly hope you are. The disease just takes whatever opportunity you give it. That's why you're here talking to me. I'm not gonna let you slip. Yeah, because you'd kick my ass. - You're an asskicker. - Don't flatter me. You know, my last sponsor? - Alison. - Yeah, Alison. Yeah. I know she was an Earth mother and an empath and not a weird abrasive bitchy lady. I mean... Well, that's why I asked you to be my sponsor. I mean, not that you're "Bitchy." - No, you're just... - Hmm. - ...not at all. - You know why I love you? You're pure sunshine, y'know? - "Anything is possible." - Please. I'm not making fun of you, I'm not. It's just that you have a way of making, um, I mean, anything, even a crisis, seem sweet, and I treasure it. Listen, I've never inventoried my joy before. I mean, fear and resentment, yeah, all day every day. I called Alison a thousand times about... - But, um... you know. - Sure. You... you know how it ended with her? No, I don't. And I don't need to know those details, sweetie. Yeah, I mean, why would you? I know people adored her, and I know that losing her in your life must have been so, so hard for you. Yeah, yeah, it was, but it was also... I mean, she was an old hippie, yeah, for sure, and she did all of that commune life and... and pretty much any way a human being could be dragged through the gutter. I mean, she... she'd been through it, she had seen it, and, uh, lived it. But as weird as stuff got, like, I think she really just approached it all with a big, big heart. I always had a hard time with hippies. Well, she was sober for a long time, you know. She was actually sober through some of her most difficult times. But like you, she was just super dedicated. Mm-hmm. - But her husband, man. He just, you know, he just relapsed. He was always relapsing and, um... He just was in a lot... had a lot of problems. I don't know. It wasn't my business. But... but she was super reliable, and we talked every day. And then there would be these hints of things. Like, uh, sometimes... Well, just a couple of times, but I heard this guy like literally screaming in the background, like a... like a raving maniac. And Alison, she would just be cool as a cucumber. At most she'd say, "Let me call you back in five minutes." - So... - Well, she may... - Uh... Maybe she... - Maybe. - ...shouldn't have been... - I mean... But she was very devoted to him. Very devoted. I mean, she would do anything for anybody. In fact, she had come into some pretty good money, like, ten years before because she had sold some real estate that they'd had forever. But then, by the end, it was gone. I mean, she'd basically... she gave it away to anyone that asked. That's a heart too big. - Like you. - No. No, no, no. Not like me. So um... ...she would tell me... well, I would ask her because I'm... I like to... I like to know what's going on with people, you know. I like... is there a napkin around here? Uh... So, there was this homeless woman who was sleeping in her car outside of Alison's house. Mm-hmm. And, you know, Alison, um, of course, couldn't... couldn't resist being nice and so she... she brought food to the woman and, um... - you know, lentil soup... - Hmm. I can smell it. Oh, I like that stuff, I like the macrobiotic. Um, but Alison had been homeless too, more than once. And so she said to the woman, "Look, you know, as long as you're parked outside here, um, you can... you can use the shower in our house if you... if you need to. You know, mi casa, su casa." - Uh... - Well, I... I... I actually think that's beautiful. But then the next part is that after a few weeks Alison, you know, sensed something weird or noticed something, I don't know, maybe it was obvious, um... So, she confronts the woman and she says, "Look. I know you're having sex with my husband. And it's okay. I understand. What I'd like to do, with your permission, is record it. Record the sex and beam it out into the universe." She told you this? Her first husband had been an engineer, and so she had some of his old equipment. Uh, radios, transmitters, and I don't even know what else. So, yes, she recorded the sex and she beamed it into outer space. See, I think the thing was is that she wanted to make contact with the extraterrestrial... the... extraterrestrial life forms... see, I don't know. I don't even know the right terminology. Um, it's like, the elders of their race would communicate with the elders of our race, the dead people, and then, they would pass messages to her husband, to her parents, and we never spoke about it, but I think that she had lost a child years before, which would make anybody crazy for the rest of their life. So, I don't even know if she was crazy. Stop... stop. Wait. Stop. Yes, she was. Sick. She was sick and suffering. I mean, very sick and suffering. And it's so important that you know that. Yeah, no, I don't pretend to understand all the stuff she was talking about. But she could be... she could be very convincing. So, she record... she recorded this and sent this out, and she wasn't certain, but she thought she was getting something back. See, it's like her mind was trying to catch up to her spirit, which is where she was very knowledgeable. Um, she felt like she was getting light, pure light, and it frustrated her that she wasn't advanced enough to... to read the messages. Yeah, I mean, I know it's... it's some weird stuff - but I um... but I loved her. - This is... breaking my heart as you tell me this. Why? Because this woman shouldn't have been a sponsor. This should not have happened, and it's a testament to your strength that you... Well, she wanted the best for me. I mean, she wanted me to receive that light too. It's a red flag. I mean... red fucking flag. It's bright red. See, a part of why I like you so much is that you're in touch with your anger. I'm... I'm open to... yeah, I mean... I mean I... I believe in spirit. I believe in a higher power for real. Okay. Yes, I understand what a higher power means in my life... I mean, we don't have to get into a theology thing, because I... I don't need sponsorship to be about... Okay, but can we please see eye to eye on the fact that it's not fucking aliens bathing you in a sex jacuzzi? I mean, I'm sorry. I'm out of line here, but fuck that and fuck her for sharing that, - for exposing you to that. - Look, I am... I am always open to anyone's spiritual journey. You know, if... if you wanna put crystals on me or whatever. I mean, I'm... I'm gonna always say yes because I think goodness and beauty flows through all of us all the time. If you let it. Okay, look, I know, I can see you're upset, and I'm sorry. I understand. I am telling you this, so, that you understand why I was listening to Alison. So, anyways, we did some light- bathing together, and I don't know if I felt... I don't know, but, I mean, I felt the presence of my grandmother, that's true, but I often feel the presence of my grandmother and I don't... I don't think, I don't know if that's radio waves or I don't know. But... Do you have to take that? So, the... the husband, not the... not the dead one, the one that was still alive, she had been giving him some legal and, uh, financial advice from these signals and it led to some bad decisions. So, he was in some trouble, on top of the trouble that he was always in, and so she asked me to help her, um, to do... to do some favors. Um... Look, she had some health issues, so, it wasn't always easy for her to get around, so, I did some errands. It's like, easy... when it was just like easy to drive a... to drive and drop a backpack off somewhere. What was in the fucking backpack? I don't think I did anything illegal, and even if... even if I did, I mean, it was... I don't think I'll get in trouble for it. This was a couple years ago, and anyways, whatever it was, it was very small. But then, you heard they disappeared. So... so I'm talking to Alison, you know, as every day, and she picks up as usual, and this time I hear airport announcements behind her, and I ask, and she says that she was going away. And that we wouldn't see each other again. And that... that she would always be with me. She said it as if she was boarding a flight to Pittsburgh or the same as ascending to Heaven. Or Centauri- Five. And, I mean, I'm not even telling you half the things that she said, things that she could've only known by, you know... through the divine, or extrasensory or... But... it's all about faith. It's about faith. And the way that Alison believed in that stuff, you know, the stuff that scared me, she also believed in me. And so, I don't... I don't... I don't know if I'd be sitting here sober - without that. - No, no. Listen. No. Don't go making her your higher power. I know. That's textbook too. I know, right, but... No "But." No, but. We lift each other up! We... we feel things, we feel things deep. And you know, sure, yeah, and there are people who don't need other people, God bless them. My dad was one of those. I mean, he could... oh, he wanted nothing more than just to go live on a desert island and... and watch the birds fly around. Me, I... I would slit my wrists. I mean... I mean, forget about a relapse, I would... I would go... ...straight to the razor, if I couldn't share my joy and pain with people. So, I needed Alison. Like I need you. And God willing, hopefully this man will be part of the tapestry of people that keep me up, keep me above myself. You know, we need... we need each other. We... you know that. We can't do it alone. Um, let's see. Um... all his written assignments have been very good quality. I have spoken to him about presentation and formatting, you know, the occasional pizza sauce on a piece of paper or something, which for boys this age, you know, is incredibly common. It's crazy the kind of things and stains you'll see on paper. But, um... but overall, really good. Really, really good. I mean, he's obviously very smart, you don't need me to tell you that. He obviously gets it. And it's like, sometimes, you know, I'll get something wrong, and he'll correct me. Call me out on my mistake. So, he's definitely sharp like that. He definitely gets it. He's definitely one of my favorites, he's a great kid. God, I don't know why they don't turn those off for parent- teacher conferences. So, that's it from me. So, like, good job, let's keep it going. He's, um, he's definitely on track for his grade level, so, we'll just keep the momentum up and I guess... Um, less pizza stains or... fewer pizza stains, and, uh... ...and we're good. So, do you have any questions for me or... Okay. I do have a question. Um, what do you do in here? Like... day to day? Um, we'll usually discuss whatever the reading assignment was, and I'll lead the discussion, but the kids are really engaged, they bring so much to it. Or we'll do specific exercises, vocabulary, worksheets, response journals, or we'll do breakout groups. We like to keep it fun. I'm so sorry, I... I don't understand. I... I teach English. How long is this class? Like an hour, 45 minutes? What are you doing as those minutes are ticking by? Sorry. Uh, ma'am, it seems like you're upset with me, and I'm not sure why but if you'd like to have a discussion... Yes, good, I'd like to have a discussion. Um, my son is on his phone during your class. Um, my son is engaging in perverse, criminal activity on his phone during your class. So, I want to know, where are you? I'm not... I'm not... Ah. This is his phone. I have no idea how he's pulling this off. I don't know if he's got it hanging from a backpack strap or what. I don't know. Do you know? But, like, the cool thing about it is it's kind of universal. Like, on one hand, it's super, super specific obviously, because not everyone has been in prison - or a political prisoner... - I think in the porn industry, this is known as an "Upskirt." ...but on the other hand, it's like kind of a metaphor or whatever, I think everyone who reads... You're disgusted. I know. It's disgusting. Well, um, this is criminal, and we should report it to the authorities. Well, as you can imagine, I have mixed feelings about turning my son over to the police, but I can't argue that he doesn't deserve punishment. Do you know the girl in question, by the way? I mean, I'm not assuming you recognize her underpants. Okay, ma'am, I... I think this is... I think this is an important conversation, but I feel extremely uncomfortable. Ooh, me too. I think we should just schedule a meeting with the principal. Mm. Well, we can do that. Um, but there's one other part... - No, I don't... - ...I wanna show you. - So stupid, like... - You don't have to watch - the video if you don't want. - Seriously? The point, listen, the point is that we all respect each other in this room... You're a fucking idiot. Hey! - I'm talking to you. - Listen... - Ah, oh, I'm sorry. - Respect is - a two- way street here, buddy. - I thought it was her. - And... - Oh, I'm sorry, is there some reason I'm supposed to respect you? I know that kid. - I am your teacher. - He's a total prick. - Kick him out already! - I'm about to, believe me. I'm about to kick all you fuckers the fuck out. I don't come in here to get shit on - by you fucking clowns, okay? - Ma'am... - Oh, my God. - You can suck my dick - if you think... - Ooh. Believe it or not, I can relate to you here, I can. I'm not proud of it. Why does the video go on so long? Nothing happens. How long does it take for these guys on the Internet to jack off? What, do you want to get me fired? You bring that video to the principal, your son also gets arrested, you know that. I could just give them the audio, if that's what I wanted. Don't be a dumb little girl. I didn't say you were dumb. I said don't be dumb. Okay, you want to talk about something? Okay, let's not make it this whole fucking harassment. They don't pay you enough, I know. And I agree, by the way. My next parents are here, so... It's not their time slot yet. You gotta give me my ten minutes. I mean, Jesus, this is the only time all year I get to see my kid's teacher. I'm always available for parents and any of their concerns, you know that. Oh, really? I... no, I didn't. Well, now you do. Hmm. Come on back. Come on. I won't go overtime, I promise. He's making money. I guess there's some kind of site they use, or he uploads it somehow. I don't know... - Ma'am. - ...if they put ads on it. I... I mean... ...what would an English teacher know about tech stuff, right? - Ma'am! - What, dear? - How can I help you? - You can't. It's just... I know I seem angry. And that's correct, I am angry. Why do you let him bring a phone to school? Excuse me? Why do I let him bring his phone? There's a phones- off policy. Well, good. Great. Um, it's a tracking device. Do you understand? I want to know if he's in school, and if he's not, I want to know where he is. And so I tell him to keep it with him and to keep it on. And you're supposed to tell him not to whip it out. What do you want to be doing? Career- wise. You're not happy teaching. - So, what is it? Tell me that. - Fuck you. No. You just want to sit in silence until the time runs out? Until you're saved by the bell? I mean, I know this seems like a big impersonal system... ...but I am telling you, it's very personal. I, um... It's very personal to the parents who entrust you with their children every day. It was true in kindergarten, - and it's true now. - I work hard. I do my best. That's all I'm going to tell you. I'm not a bad teacher. Oh, sweetie, you are. You slipped through the cracks. I've had jobs... ...I didn't care about. - I get it. - No, I didn't say that. But you don't know anything. You really don't... don't know anything. - Okay. I'm listening. Excuse me? You're not my mom, you're not my therapist. You're just like a crazy old bitch. And I'm sorry, but you called me a dumb little girl, so, I think I have the moral right to call you a bitch, who came in here and ambushed me with all this shit like it's my fault or there's something wrong with me just because your son is a fucked up evil perv. I'm so sorry, just one more minute, we're almost done. You want to be a yoga instructor or... a corporate executive? Volunteer at the animal shelter? What is it? I wanted to be a lawyer. Well, really, I think I wanted to be a judge. You think I'm judgmental? None of this has anything to fucking do with me, - you hateful black hole. - Wrong. Your time is up. Go. If it hurts, it has something to do with you. How does this have anything to do with your son? Like... like, do you even care what he does in my class? Like, do you read his papers? Uh, do I want to know a 16- year- old pervert's insights into the oeuvre of Toni Morrison? Oh, Jesus Christ! I was a worse fuckup than you when I was your age. So, no law school for me. Ooh, we're almost out of time. Do you want a minute to get your composure before, um, Christiane's parents? Oh, God, I hope that's not her on the Internet. Ugh. I don't mean to torture you. I really don't. I do want to help you. Get the fuck out of my classroom! Go! - They can hear you. - Go! - Deep breaths. - Deep breaths. Okay? You're a bad mother. Yeah, no one's saying that you invented porno. That's not the issue here. The issue here is that you have created and are profiting off an infrastructure which allows, and, they're claiming, not me, actively encourages minors to produce and consume inappropriate and frequently illegal content. Okay. You know, and then these kids get paid for it. That's... that puts you in the position of being... of being... uh, uh... Uh... Listen, the law is mostly on your side here actually. But you're... you're creating additional challenges for yourself. - What... what is that? Is that your... fucking balls monitor just telling you that you're empty? Yeah. Yep, that's right. How did you know? It's, uh... I'm low on jism. I've gotta go, uh, get some. Would you mind, uh, if I just go chug some for a second and get my levels back up? One sec. Oh, whoops. Shit. What the f... Oh, no. You're a platform developer. You don't curate content, you're not a content creator, okay? Ninety- five percent of the videos that you host are cooking videos, or viral dance videos, kitty cats. - Yeah. But I do curate. - You don't! You don't! And don't ever say that you do in a deposition. I kick people off, that's curation. So, boost people I like. Right. Who do you kick off? Whoever the fuck I feel like. But not masturbating 16-year-olds. No, because that's nature. And why would I fight against that? Automatic cappuccino maker. Really good. Like, really good. It's... it's amazing. Yeah, I mean, I used to have one of those big fucking Italian barista machines, you know, but I hated it. I... I couldn't do it and it required all this maintenance. It's like, you know, I'm not trying to own a fucking Ferrari here, I just wanna stay awake a little bit and get some enjoyment out of life. You know that girl in Paris was underage, right? That's not funny. I don't know what you're doing but it's not funny. The, uh... the party. Yes, I talked to... I talked to a girl at the very stupid party you dragged me to in Paris. I'm just saying that she was underage. I know that, dipshit. We were talking about her... her university applications. But I never laid a hand on this person, nor would I, so, fuck you, and... and fuck you! You want to release a statement? No. "Information wants to be free..." That's not a statement. "And if that sounds deadeningly familiar, it's because it's never not been true." That's not a statement. "Capitalism is an engine. Technology is a lubricant." Look, man. "And the freedoms that undergird - a legitimate democracy... I just don't wanna dig your grave for you, all right? For one thing... - ...are inherently open source." - ...I care about you. And, um, for another, I think that you made something important. Really important. Could be really important, if you don't piss it all away. Have I done anything illegal? I don't know. Probably. I don't know. When? Professionally, limpdick. I don't know that either. And I don't want to know. My job is to anticipate and make sure that you're adequately prepared for and defended from specific challenges. Hmm. Fuck you. You're fired. I suppose this is an example of your famously awful sense of humor? Yeah, if not, que será, será. Because you want to know... you want... you want to know the truth? Hmm? As your friend, not as your lawyer, because if you're serious, if you were serious, then... then I'm not your lawyer, right? So, as your friend, I feel bad for you. I feel bad for you because I think that you, you live your life in fear, man. And I know you... you walk around, you jut out your chest, your big manly chest, you're a fucking ambitious kid who's shaking things up and "Disrupting," but you're not... you... ...you've got a... you've got a disruptive mind. You do. And you know what? You're afraid. You're afraid of success. Now, I know you can say, "Well, I made all this money, and Bitcoin, and fuckton and whatever." And I totally get it and I respect that, because I'm a capitalist too. But, man, I... I've never seen anyone less interested in taking responsibility, more evasive, while simultaneously being too stubborn to know this about yourself and let people, other people, more responsible people pamper your ass, which is all anybody ever wanted to do, you entitled fuck. Just gonna read from the... ...the letter I sent you. How are you still talking? "While we've never expected your professional conduct to reflect any personal sense of decency, we must expect at the very least that you will respect your own self- preservation instinct and comply with the existing court orders rather than risking the complete annihilation of your remaining corporate assets and 'reputation.'" And... ...they put "reputation" in quotes which I think is rather funny. I mean, it's good writing, uh, poetic. Um... - Goodbye. - Bye. Good. Great. I dare you. I fucking dare you. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Can you see me? Ask yourself if you could have built what you built without me. Honestly, ask yourself, if we're more powerful together, or apart. That's it? That... that's all you got? Yeah, well, I'm not gonna sit here and plead and debase myself. Uh, I mean, you do keep telling me I'm your only major client anymore. I'm pretty sure your wife is gonna fuck you in the divorce. Yeah, we're not getting a divorce. Oh, that's... that's... I'm glad to hear. That's awesome. We're figuring things out. Yeah. You'll be all right. Kristine is cool. She... she's gonna put the kids first at least. Yo, where is your hot wife right now? Where are the kids? None of your fucking business. They're with her parents for next couple weeks. The point is... I love you. Of course I do. Probably more than anybody else does. What? Is that... am I... am I crazy? Is that so wrong? I mean, do you remember the first time, um, that we met? At the... we got a beer at the... that bar. Oh, what was the name of that place? I don't know, it's... it had the dance music like a... I mean, I don't even know how they let you in the place. You didn't look like you were more than 12 years old to me at the time, and... Yeah, that was like three years ago. Well, you looked young. And you acted young. And I still think you'd a lot to learn about the world. And, I mean, I did too. - Hmm. - I... I did too. But... ...taking this journey with you... and helping you, uh, achieve your dreams of financial success... it's... it's been a wonderful education. But the... the one thing I'll... I'll never forget, despite, you know, how much of an asshole you've been to me over the years and probably right now... is I'll always say to myself, "That kid trusted me." That I don't take for granted. - It's like... - Hmm. ...have you ever been in love for real? I mean, I... I know you've fucked. You've fucked your cock off and I've heard you speak admiringly about various ladies, but, I mean, have you... have you even been in love? You're the worst lawyer in the world. - You... you know that, right? - Hmm... No. But you can go ahead, continue to impugn my character - all you want. - Look, I didn't keep you around this long because I thought you were competent. Right. Hey, you're a great dude. I know. I mean, you're a piece of shit... ...yeah, but... but I love you too. You're too much fun, you goofy bitch. Too much motherfucking fun! So, no matter what happens... always know that I love you. And, yes, okay, I know what love is. Do you? I mean, do you... do you think you'll ever get married? Yeah, man. Yeah. I could definitely raise some kids, fuck yeah. - Yeah. - But I'm talking... I'm tapping into... all of love. You know... family, romantic, sexual, love of mankind, love of the Lord, all of it. Wow. So, you're all religious now and shit? Now, are you fucking with me? - Look... - Ha- ha. I wanna keep working with you. So, let's work together, hmm? - My only condition... - Mm-hmm. Listen, man... is that... you know... no more little ideas. Let's do something big and majestic together. - Yeah. - Okay? Peace. I love you, dawg. Peace. Ah, fuck! For real? I'm sorry, I can't. I can't. I'm so tired. Not trying to make excuses here, but I... I'm exhausted. You know? I mean, I tried. I mean, sort of I did. You... you gotta... you gotta deal with the world you've got, not the one you want, and you gotta be willing to make compromises. Does that mean you're damning your soul to Hell? Does it? Yeah, it does, actually. Hell? Hell, Hell? I don't believe in Hell. You don't either. Eternity. It's just another word for consequences. Anyway, it's a long time, bubbe. Hell for what? That seems a little extreme, if you ask me. I mean, say what you will about a lot of things, and I would say... that the only thing that really matters... The only, you know, the only way you can really judge a man, or me, on, is what kind of a father have I been to my girls. You know? Imperfect? Definitely. Definitely. But committed, devoted. You know that. Everybody knows that. Boo- yah. Plus, I'm a pretty good lawyer too. I mean, despite what certain fuckwit clients might say, and I know you know that. Would you please stop staring at me like that? Just sitting there presuming a moral authority. - But I don't trust ghosts. - I'm not presuming anything. You just started talking. Okay, you're right. You know what, go ahead. Bring it on. I mean, I know you've been gone for a while, so, just to bring you up to speed, Kristine has told me plenty about my deficiencies over the last several years, so, I'm pretty well informed in that regard. But... ...how do you measure a man? By his choices, certainly, but I also pose to you this... Are you arguing a case here? Don't open your mouth if you haven't prepped. I know that. You taught me that. I just wanna have a conversation about choices versus circumstances, okay? Okay. Fuck, you loved baseball! Right? Could you choose to be a major leaguer? No. But you did the best you could with what you had, and you accepted that with dignity. By the way, I always think of you as a man with exceptional dignity. I still do. So, what, you're... you're expecting me to believe that you're... you're burning in Hell? Come on. I'm here. I'm here. Can I get some more water, please? Is that allowed? I wish I smoked. Ah, of course, you know... ...more than... Make yourself at home. I... I'd get you water but I, you know... Congratulations, that's terrific. What would a good man do? Get in the car... be up there by... a little bit before breakfast, surprise Kristine and the kids. Of course, there was a reason I wasn't invited on this trip. Plus, her father would murder me, which kinda ruins breakfast. You ever fart somewhere, like a, um, a car or an elevator maybe, and think, if I just inhale enough of this fart myself, that'd be like a public service? You know, like, if... if I can filter enough of this air myself, it's like a service to others, and... in fact, I might just get away with it, and... and they'll be none the wiser for my efforts. Extremely private, extremely personal, I know. But isn't it a kind of a metaphor for sin in general? Were you a dandruff sufferer perchance? I still do get outbreaks in my eyebrows from time to time... Nah, come on. You know what, not constructive. Say hi to my dad, would you? Ask him why he's not here doing this. Seems like this ought to be his job. Seems pretty spineless to send you. Your father loves you. - I thought you loved me too. - Yeah, I do, but... I'm not afraid to kick your ass. Yeah. I was at your funeral. I cried. I cried so much. I hope you saw that. I hope it made you feel bad. I cried when your niece sang that stupid Barbara Streisand song. To this day, if I... if I hear like even a... a Muzak version of that song, I get emotional. - So, fuck you. - Okay. Fuck you for dying. Fuck you for the fact that we'll never know what was going through your head. Or the fact that we'll never know what kind of pain you were in. Oh, you'll know. You'll learn all about that. This is a little embarrassing, but... are you just a projection of my conscience? Whatever you need to tell yourself. If you need new analogy, you... All right. And the general idea here being that you want me to make changes. Start live righteous, stop making excuses for all the shitty things that I do in my personal and - professional life, am I right? - Yes, this is... Yep, you're getting it. You get... you're moving along now. Uh- huh. And you want me to stop resenting the dead too, - is that part of the deal? - Worry about the next life when you get here, okay? Huh. Yeah, well. I'm depressed. Can... can we walk around a little or something? I... Stress eating. You see that? "Of course I do. Why, I see everything. I've got God on my side." Hey, do you... do you like ever see Babe Ruth up there? Or down there, wherever. DiMaggio? - Don't be an idiot. - Okay, okay. Are you inhabiting the, uh, cappuccino maker now? That'd be fun. Hey, buddy, it's me, your attorney. Um... do me a favor, give me a call when you get a second. Um... I... I'm thinking about making some changes here and, uh, I think I've got to cease our professional relationship. Uh, not that you need any advice, but, um, you know, I'm happy to refer you to other counsel. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to have you. Um... you know, it's not you, it's me, homie. I'm just... I'm thinking I gotta get into some more pro bono type work, you know. Little less pro boner, little more pro bono. Sorry. Okay. Bye. Push- ups. Hey, Dad? If you can hear me... I miss you. I... I'm sorry about calling you spineless. That was out of line. Am I being raptured? Or is it an actual earthquake? Whoo! Good! Good! I don't assume anything about anybody, you know. I don't bring any preconceptions here because that's a way to shut your mind off. You're wrecked, girl. Ah. How many did you have before I even show up? You pre- gaming... - ...pretty hard here, yeah. - Well, wouldn't you... wouldn't you want something to take the edge off before meeting someone as hot, hot, hottie with the body as you, sir? Yeah. What... but... but seriously, like, what... what's your skin care regimen? You should have a YouTube channel. And I should be watching it. Your body is a temple. So, sloppy drunk is not exactly my thing, so. Sorry. Bye. Sloppy drunk is every guy's thing! Who the fuck do you think you are, you judgmental piece of shit? So sorry for the disturbance. Enjoy your evenings. Enjoy them. I need another. I surely do. - Ma'am? - Hmm? Ma'am, excuse me? Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. - Fuck. Um... - Yeah. I'm... I'm a... I'm a good person, I just... I got angry at this guy. But, um... but I'm... I'm a good customer, - a loyal customer. - And yet, it is time to go. - A good tipper. - Let me walk you out. Come on. Let's go. You're the... you're the owner, right? I... I'm in here, like, every week. There's a... there's a group of us. - Uh- huh. - We do... we do a teachers' happy hour thing. My purse, sorry. I'm sorry. I... appreciate the help. I'm fine. - Ma'am. - Um, one last thing. What I would most like to do is just sit down here very, very quietly and sober up. Like, maybe have some water or coffee if you think that that's the way to go but, um... I shouldn't drive. You know, I could call you an Uber. Thank you. I'll be... I'll be so quiet. Like a little... like a little church mouse. Like a dormouse. Can I just have like a large water? When you get the... when you get the chance. Which one's quietest? Uh, church mouse, dormouse? Good question! Uh... I don't know anything about mice. - Ah. Not a science teacher. - No, definitely not. There. You were roaring like a lion at your friend there. I know, and I'm... I'm super sorry. I really am. - What'd he do to you? - Um... I... I don't even know him. I just... He seems like a real asshat, but, uh, I just swiped right, you know. Well, looks like you swiped wrong. Boo! Um... well, not about him. My self-esteem is not so hot right now, so, uh, I don't know... yelling. Well, you're very articulate. Me teach English. Cheers. Tell me about the restaurant business. You know, I'd rather not. What are you, like, a rugged fisherman, - Jimmy Buffett fan? - Jimmy Buffett? One day you were, like, frying up some flounder or something and the other fellas on the boat were like, "Hey, Captain, you're really good at this. You ought to start a bar and grill." Whoo, some big Buffett energy. Are you married? Put up... Show up... show me your left hand. Wow, okay, so, either not married or not wearing the ring. Ooo-la-la, what happens at the bar and grill, stays at the bar and grill. Well, nothing happens at the bar and grill. Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. - Really? Not even after closing time? You ever had, like, a young, sexy bartender? Ma'am. Ma'am. Ah. Okay. Inappropriate. I know. Sorry, I've read the handbooks. I'm a teacher. Bad. Seems like you've had a tough day. Yeah. They're all tough, right? Not supposed to be easy. I have seen you with your teacher gang. You all seem to have a lovely time together. Maybe you get a little bit silly, you get your giggles going, but then you all head off home safely in a good mood. That's exactly what this place is supposed to be for, actually. You noticed me. - I know your group. - Yeah, but you noticed me. I'm the sexy one. Well, there's your self-esteem roaring back. That's not self-esteem. You're a man, old enough to be my dad... Our kind of sexiness isn't the kind that fades. Don't let one douchey guy from a... from a dating app - throw you off. - No? God, you're laying it on pretty thick, huh? Trying to seduce the drunk teacher. If you might recall, I'm the one that's generously allowing you to finish that water before I evict you from my premises. And into your bed. - Excuse me? - On your houseboat. - Come on. - Arr, matey! This seacraft is rocking, - don't come a-knocking. - It was, um, it was lovely chatting with you. You can finish the water if you want to. And let me know if you need that Uber. Ah, come... Take a fucking joke, man. - Shirley Temple. - Don't call me Shirley. - You know, now, I am... - What? Well, I've treated women disastrously in my life. Of course, you have. I mean, when I was younger, like that date you had, and more recently. No doubt. But I'm trying to do better, you know? I'm trying to not lead with fear and self-hate because that's gotten me into lots of trouble. What am I... what is... Am I in your men's group with you? Well, um... what I mean is... things can get better. And, look, I wouldn't be bothering to try and cheer you up if it weren't for the fact that someone cheered me up and made me feel good about myself just recently and I just really... I really love the example that that set... - so... - Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So... what's up, dude? What do you mean? Are you in love with this person who "cheered you up?" How'd she blow your mind? I do not know. I don't... I... I'm trying to figure that out myself. It sounds pretty serious. Well, we just met. You and me, or you and the magic healer lady with the crystals in her pants or whatever? Did you, uh... did you meet her here? Uh, yes, we did. We did. But that was incidental. I mean, she wasn't, you know, like, sitting at the bar drowning her sorrows. - No, of course not. - And we left here. We... well, um, I'm not gonna narrate the whole thing, but it was... it wasn't... wasn't like this, you know, certain power dynamic. Is she 22? She's not. She's age appropriate. - Thank you very much. - Hmm. - What'd you do to her? - What did I do? You took her home and satisfied her, - I'm assuming. - A gentleman never tells. Like she's never been satisfied before. Come on, you ain't no gentleman. You're Jimmy Buffett vibin' old man, don't-even-know-your- illegitimate-grandkids-names. Oh, thank God. You really are an English teacher. I might not be for much longer. You're very funny. Very funny, you know that. - When I'm trashed. - And you're smart. I always thank God that I'm not too smart. All the really smart people I know are just... they just fucking torture themselves. All that sharp, sharp razor wit, just like...you know... You keep that back there for self-defense? In a way, yeah. Shit, man, don't you have work to do? Me? Work? With my vibe? Oh, you're shady. Tell me something positive about yourself. Will you knock it off with this Dr. Phil bullshit? Go on. I mean, one thing. I assume you're an amazing teacher. - Pfft! - And you're the life and soul, that's for sure. I mean, and that's... ...that can be a good thing, you know. People like that kind of... that kind of energy in their life. You lift other people up with you. I mean, you've certainly given my evening a lift. Hmm. Um... I'm a good driver and I'm not just saying that because I'm about to walk out of here still somewhat buzzed and be, like, fucking impeccable on the road home. Um... I have a good memory. Steel trap. I remember every fucked up thing my mom and dad ever did, - which freaks them out. - Come on, come on. Give me the good stuff. The... the serious stuff. - Oh, fuck. Um... - Come on! Okay. I am smart. I am kinda burnt out on people ages, I don't know, 14 to 50, but I get along really well with small children and the elderly. And I think I treat them all right. I am a good friend. Faithful friend. I give a phenomenal blow job. I am diligent and determined. I think I'm generally pretty open-minded and curious. And... I'm a good cook. - I like myself. Okay? - See, there you go. Wasn't too hard. Yeah, feel like a million bucks, pal. Hey, I was serious about the Uber. I have my own phone. But I really appreciate the chivalry, though. But, um... Phone number if you want. But also my address if you wanna Uber yourself over and fuck the shit out of a nice young, young-ish, schoolteacher. No? Okay. Huh. Wow. - You were gonna do it! - Oh, Jesus. You were gonna do me! You dirty, dirty, dirty... I was just cleaning off the bar. - Come on. - Oh, my goodness. What about your new girlfriend? She was such a game-changer until you forgot she existed! Ma'am. Please. "Ma'am." Okay, leaving for real now. Good night, creepo!
