Backtrack starting to make up good yardage. He's closing on the outside. They run past the quarter pole, and cozy girl is gone clear by three lengths. Now, backtrack coming up. Come on, cozy girl. Come on, cozy girl! He's gonna be a danger to cozy girl. They come for home. Cozy girl is clear by two. 114 to roper. Come on, dig in, cozy girl. Dig in! Roper here. 114, roper. Code two, C. P., 4th and grand. Backtrack is catching stride for stride on the outside. Come on, cozy girl! E. T. A. In five. I'm en route! Cozy girl is tenacious, but backtrack keeps on making up ground on her. Cozy girl and backtrack! Gonna be a tight photo in this one. Come on, cozy baby! Break the wire! Here's the wire! Come on. Come on, cozy girl. Come on, cozy girl. It's so close between those two, cozy girl! Cozy girl! But backtrack has won it... In a nose over cozy girl! Cozy girl, you lazy bitch! Backtrack wins. Cozy girl second. You lazy, hag-ass bitch! That cozy shit is why we lost this race, being fuckin' cozy! You need to get the fire under your ass! Move in. All the way. Clear! Take position! I'm all right. I got this one. Bar windows. I'm 97 at the inner perimeter. No, no, communications are down. He ripped the phone out. Yeah, yeah, he's here now. Got it. Hey, Scott. Hey, Eiko, where's the command post? It's down here. Hey, Bob, I need two guys to go to C. P. Now what's going on? Suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. Teller hit the silent alarm. He's taken 17 hostages, shot one, the guard. He's still alive. So far, he's asked for a... car. And a plane waiting at the airport. And if he doesn't get that... He'll kill all the hostages in five minutes. Right. What's the suspect's name? Earl. Earl. Shit, you'd think on a day like today, Earl would go to the park or something, right? Ladies and gentlemen. What's up, man? Scott. Hey. Roper, glad you could make it. Captain Solis is on his way down. You guys got a profile on Earl? Yeah. This guy's no genius. They ain't usually graduate students. SWAT wants to go in. What, they ain't killed nobody yet this week? Okay, we got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459s. He's been busted on possession. Never been busted on a major felony. What's this guy's demeanor? He's a little fuckin' agitated. He ripped the phone out. I gotta go face-to-face. No. I don't think so. Sam, you got a building full of hostages. One of them is hurt, we don't know how bad. This nut pulled out the telephone. SWAT said he had a gun to somebody's head. If SWAT goes in there, you're gonna lose one person, possibly two. You gotta let me go in there, look around and make sure everything's all right. I don't know. Sam, look at the guy's rap sheet. There's no violence on there. The guy's never offed anybody. Hey, look, are you gonna let me go in there... Or we gonna stand around and talk and let this guy bleed to death? Can I have a dozen doughnuts, please? What makes a guy do something like that? Give me a roof and a rifle any day. C.P., I see a W.M.A. In window three... Holding a handgun to Asian female's head. Suspect is wearing a black vest and t-shirt. I'm gonna kill somebody! If they don't give me my goddamn car, I'm gonna kill somebody! Who the fuck are you, man? Hey, how you doing, Earl. I'm Scott roper, the negotiator. Get up! Get up! Get up where I can see you! Hands up! Get back! Get back! Stop right there, motherfucker! Hands up! Hands up! Get back! Get back! Step back! Stop right there, man! Stop. Okay, Earl. All right. I'm stopping. All right, turn around. I don't carry a weapon, Earl. I'm a negotiator. I have no gun. See? Keep your hands up! I'm just pattin' down, pattin' down for you. Hands up! All right? What's in the hand, man? What's in the bag? These are doughnuts, Earl. I know y'all been in here for awhile, so I brought some doughnuts in case anybody wanted a snack or something. Drop the fuckin' bag! Drop the bag. Okay, no problem. I'll put the doughnuts down. It's just doughnuts, okay, Earl? Relax. Kick 'em over! Okay. Hands up! Goddamn it, let me see you! Kick it over, man. Kick it over! Pick it up. Pick it up! Pick it up! Open the bag! Show me what's in the bag! Open it! It's doughnuts, man. That's what I said, man. I told you they were doughnuts. This is bullshit, man! You poisoning that shit! You put fuckin' powdered shit in it, man! Earl, no, no. You're fuckin' with me! No, Earl. Look, I'm not playing with you. They're just doughnuts. Eat it! Eat one! Please, eat. Don't even worry about the doughnuts. Eat the doughnut! Let them eat 'em. See? Where's my fucking car, man? I'm getting you your car, but first things first. All right, Earl? We have to do this thing right. All right? Okay, Earl? I want you to take that gun and point it away from... what's your name, miss? Debbie. You point that gun away from Debbie's head, okay? Debbie's fuckin' brains are gonna be all over the floor in five minutes, you don't give me my car, man! No, Earl. That's the worse thing you can do. That's a really bad move if you do that. Okay? Let's be clear about something. If you kill anybody, I can't help you. No, please, god, no. All right? I can't help you. The rules of the game change. SWAT will take you out if you kill somebody. That's what they gear up for. No. Please, no. They're ready to do you right now. I want you to see something. Come here. Just look... Just look out the window here. Look across the street. There's a sniper in the window. He's looking at you right now in the scope on his rifle. The window next to it... Sniper in there too. Oh, shit, man. Fuck. All around the building, you got SWAT on the roof. Fuck, man. And they've been given the word. If you kill anybody... Anybody... they take you out. And they don't give a shit. They'll take you out and go right to lunch, okay? Fuck! Fuck, man. Fuck. What are my chances, man? Not bad. You know, last month somebody robbed a bank in Daly city. He made it to the freeway. Cops gave him a car, he got on the freeway and he lost 'em. Really? But they didn't kill anybody. Hmm? How you doing, Harold? Hey, what are you doing to that man? Okay, Earl. I gotta take Harold outta here. He's bleeding pretty bad. I took an oath as a negotiator. If I ever go into a hostile situation and there's an injured party, I'm duty-bound by that oath to take the person to safety. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator is gonna tell you the same thing. Just give me my car, man. All right? Give me my car. Everybody, everything's gonna be all right. We're gonna get everybody outta here. Okay? You give me my car! I'll do her, man! I fuckin' swear! I'm not fuckin' around! We'll get you your car. All right? And Earl, Earl, take that gun down from Debbie's head. Don't mess with me. Don't fuck with me, man. You don't want any accidents. Everything's gonna be cool. Give me my car, man! Don't kill me! Shut up! Come on! Hold your fire! Let's go! Let's go! That's one out. Seventeen to go. Okay, Harold, here you go. Give me your gun. What? Give me your gun. I haven't had to shoot anybody in three years. Why not keep the streak alive? 'Cause this strung-out junkie's gonna kill somebody. What the hell are you doing out there? What's goin' on? Okay, Earl, it's happening. Got your car comin'. Harold's gone to safety. Everything is cool. We're gonna get everybody out of here. But first, as a show of good faith, give me another hostage. Give me Debbie. I gave you the old fuckin' man, man! He don't count, man. He was bleeding. He was gonna die in here. That would have been on your ass. I did you a favor taking him outta here. Now give me a hostage. Give me Debbie. Am I gettin' my car, man? You're gonna get your car, but give me a hostage. Give me Debbie, man. Take them, man! Take 'em! Take 'em! Take them! Take them! Okay, you three, let's go. Go! Please don't kill me. Please don't. I see we're making progress. We're gonna get everybody out. Everybody relax. I'm gonna get your car right now. Get me my car, man. You'll get your car right now. Give me my car, man. I'll get your car. Oh, there's one other thing. What? What? You want a hardtop or a convertible? Fuck, man. A fuckin' hardtop, man. Hardtop. Hardtop, man. Hardtop. All right. Manual or automatic? Automatic. Stay down! Don't you fuckin' move! Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me! I give up, man! Everybody down! On the floor! Don't shoot me, man! Don't shoot me! On the floor! Don't shoot! Don't shoot, man! Don't shoot! Don't... Captain Solis, can we speak to inspector roper? Captain Solis! Inspector roper! Please, hold your questions. You successfully negotiated nine times in the past. What was different about this situation? Please, ladies and gentlemen, the inspector is not available to answer your questions now. We're just very thankful nobody got killed in this incident. Can't you give us something? The inspector will be available to answer your questions in two hours... At the official police briefing at police headquarters. Inspector roper, are you okay? Are you okay, inspector? I'm fine. Please, please. We have no further... Hey. That is one for the front page. What are you doing coming down here and torturing me? You know I'm in love with you. Don't start. Don't tell me not to start. Look, Ronnie. That baseball player you're running around with; That guy is bad news. Really? Let's think about this. He makes two million a year. Really nice guy. And he worships me. I worship you too. Scott, you worship your bookie. No, forget that. What's this guy's name? Greg. Well, I read that Greg's knees are blown out. Ten years, you're pushin' him around in a wheelchair. Lot of hills in this town. You know what I think? I think you only want me back... Because you can't have me. Well, I don't think it matters what you think. What matters is I think we should be together. Hey, hey, hey, listen to me. Can we please go out this weekend? No way. And talking of going out... What about Troy? You told me you'd take him out over a month ago? Veronica, I had a rough month. I know I was supposed to get with him. He misses you. I tell him you're coming around and his eyes light up, then you don't... Now why you wanna lay all this guilt on me, huh? Look, Saturday. We'll get together on Saturday; Me, you and Troy, we'll go to the park. We'll have the most beautiful day. One big, happy family. No, no. You and Troy. We spend enough time together. Troy needs a man in his life. And besides, I'm seeing Greg on Saturday. What do you mean you're "going out with Greg on Saturday"? You're gonna go out with Greg and I'm supposed to go with Troy to the park? That's a little tacky. Tacky? Yes, that's tacky. And it's gonna confuse Troy. You don't think so? Can I drive you to the paper so we can talk about this? Please, can I drive you? Huh? Hey! Hey! Hey, that's my car! Not anymore! Now it belongs to silver hills financial! Good work today, Scott. Thank you, inspector. I needed it two days ago. How we doin' for tonight? Two on the floor. You're my hero. Dinner's on you. You got yourself a deal. I gotta meet with Solis. Okay, go get him. Later on. Absolutely. Yes, sir. I agree with you 100 percent. Yeah, he just walked into my office. Chief says, "good job this morning. Congratulations." Tell him to give me a raise then. He said, "thank you very much." That's not what I said. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I'll discuss it with him right now. Yes, sir. Good-bye, chief. Roper. What? It has been decided that you will take on a new partner... And train him to be able to take over for you. Is that why you got this guy in the Sunday school outfit sitting out here in the lobby? His name is Kevin McCall. Oh, Captain. Every Metro Captain agrees he's their best sharpshooter... And the most likely to succeed. This is bullshit, Captain. Tested high on his intellectual aptitude, didn't he? Not as high as me, but pretty high. That's true. National marksman's finalist, attended NYC, went to college. Very impressive. FBI sniper school. Mayoral commendation. Additional skills: Biathlete, marathoner, lip-reading. This is great. Why don't you send this guy to the marines? He's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks. You let me worry about that. Well, I hope there's gonna be some kind of expression of y'all's appreciation... If I gotta hang out with Huck Finn over there. What, uh... what kind of appreciation did you have in mind? Honestly? Five thousand dollars. Okay, I can do that. And a car. I'm not giving you a goddamned car. I just gave you a $5,000 raise. Get your own damn car. Come on, Captain. I've been down to impound. I saw what you got there. You got a beautiful black Benz just sittin' there right now. Nobody's doin' nothin'. Impound is not a rent-a-car company. The car's part of the deal. I don't have a car. Well, what the hell happened to your trans am? They repoed my shit. Look, I'm not promising you nothing, but I'll see what I can do. Look, do what you can. Oh, and I get to keep all the money even if this guy quits 'cause SWAT guys don't have... The temperament or the background for what I do, you know what I'm sayin'? How you doin', man? I'm lookin' forward to working with you. You'll be good. You've got a lot of hard work in front of you. I'm up to it. Don't worry, I'll be around longer than two weeks. So, don't, don't worry about that, okay? Hey, man, don't be readin' my lips and shit. You save that for sniper school. Okay, well, don't worry about what I'm gonna do for the next weeks, okay? Gentlemen, can we move past this? We got past it. We're getting acquainted with each other. I'm fine. Well, I think that's very nice. Now, if you both excuse me, I do have other work to do. My bad. We're gone. Thank you, Captain. Roper? Sir? About the transportation issue? See the impound sergeant. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. So, you ever been in a hostage situation? Only at the very end. Yeah, what did you feel like after the shooting? Like it had to be done. It very rarely has to be done. And I've very rarely shot anyone. Yeah, well, SWAT is a lifesaving unit. Remember that. Now I know that, okay? You know, you know a lot. You're a wiseass. No, excuse me? You heard what I said. You're a wiseass. And I got a special little test for first-day wiseasses here. Look. I want you to get this cap out of the bottle... Sure. Without touching, without destroying the bottle. Okay. Okay, don't move it. And what's the point? It's a little test in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution. You got options. Use your head. Use your mind. Don't break the bottle. Okay. Have a nice day. Okay. No touching! Hey, don't look at me. I went to public school. Right. Great. Thank you. Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on the Polk street jewelry heist. Phony Frank? Don't waste your time. That guy'd finger his firstborn to dodge a collar. I still got to do it. Wasting time is half my job. Yeah, all right. You know, I think that SWAT guy might be a good idea. May take a little pressure off you. I'm beginning to worry about you. Where is... what are you worryin' about me for? I saw you talkin' to Ronnie this morning. I don't know why you can't get it back together? Ah! I mean, you got to be out of your mind not to get with that one. What are you talking about? It's not me. It's her. She's goin' out with some baseball player named Greg Barnett. No kiddin'? Mm. Get out of here. That boy can hit... and run. And throw! Why don't you just get some pom-poms and start chanting, "Greg, Greg, Greg." Fuck him! What is wrong with this car door? Come on, man. Give me the keys. There's no alarm on those. Hey, y'all got a spare key so I can get to this kill switch in here... And turn this shit off? This shit is bad. You hear me, Sam? This is some bad shit. Rope, this is it. This is too fly. This is it. What? This is it. This is your ride. No, that's not my ride. This is my ride over here. This black car's my ride. No, no, no. The black one is mine. That's the one I'm... this is my ride. This is your ride. Oh, come on, now. Who am I, Redd Foxx? I can't roll in no shit like that. Man, what's up, Sam? That shit's not funny, Sam. I gotta roll around in this shit all week. Man, where's your stereo? Never mind the stereo. What's that smell? Oh, man, just get in. We ain't got all day. Man, this truck smells like fish. Fish and shit. Apartment 304. You want me to come up? Nah, it probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him. Good, 'cause I don't wanna be late. Hey, you want anything on the game? What's the line? Warriors plus six. I'll take half your action. Very, very smart man. Hurry up, man. Who is it? Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco police department. Everything all right? May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions. Absolutely. Come on in. Thank you. Nice. Very nice. Thanks. Count Basie? Ellington. "Things ain't what they used to be." It was recorded July 30, 1945. Yeah, yeah. Now I can hear it. Where did you find an old recording like that? There's a used record shop down on Turk street called memory Lane. I went in there looking for a rare Robert Johnson. I think I know the place. I'd like to get in there. You should. Mr. Korda, do you know a Frank Antonucci? Guy who owns the bakery down the street? No, this is a different Frank. This is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen, usually. You wouldn't know anybody like that? No, I certainly would not. Is it... no, it's just a little something here. Could I have a little water, please? Sure. Thank you. The reason I'm asking you is because... We arrested him with some stolen jewelry. We traced it back to a robbery of a store down on Polk street. He said he was fencing it for you. Obviously, there's been some mistake. Look, I gotta level with you. I got this cousin. Here you go. He's had a lot of run-ins with the law. I wouldn't be surprised if he's trying to entangle me in this situation. It wouldn't be the first time. This cousin of yours. What's his name? Clarence teal. Believe me, they'll know who I'm talkin' about. Your cough seems better. Oh, yes. Two hundred bucks. I'll take the points. Yeah. Okay. Hello, judge stone? This is lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a suspect's residence. I'm requesting a telephonic search warrant. There's visible evidence on the premises, glassine envelopes with jeweler's markings. That is correct, judge stone. I believe a full search of the premises will turn up... Jesus! Sam! Sam! Call an ambulance! Now! Now! Oh, my god! Clear for rescue. I'm a cop. Move! Yes, sir, all of our forces will be brought to bear. We will get this guy. Yeah, he's here. I'll tell him. The chief wants you to know how sorry he is. He said he was just going up to talk to the guy. He said... I wanna be put on this case. I can't do that. No, I want&gt; To be put on this case. I cannot assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You're too close to Sam. You let the department handle it. Who's runnin' it? Roper! Who's runnin' it? Kimura and glass will head the investigation. Scott. Go home. Okay, check on it. Tell me what you've got on the son of a bitch. Let me get back to you. Solis said to keep you out of this. I don't give a shit what Solis said. Anybody get any information on this fucking korda, you tell me about it. Just a minute. Hey. Hey yourself. I came to see Troy. It's a little late for that, Scott. He's asleep. Oh, shit. Jack Daniels? Yes, I spent some time with Jack tonight. But I'm not drunk yet. Maybe you should be. You heard about what happened? Yeah. I'm sorry. Can I come in for a minute? Is that a new picture? It's about four months old. I've been working on a different style. Hey, Troy. How ya doin'? How ya doin'? Did you miss me, huh? Did you miss me? Huh, Troy? Did you miss me? Did you? No kissing though. No kissing. You know I don't do that kissing thing, right? I'm not gonna take up too much of your time. I need somebody I can talk to. Must be pretty awful. You don't usually talk to someone when you're hurting. It was my fault. I was right downstairs. All I had to do was just go up with him. I was right there. Scott, y-you can't save everyone. Yeah, well, I definitely proved that tonight for sure. Look, uh, I don't even know why I came up here. This was a... Total waste of my time. Where'd I put my keys? Where'd I put my keys? Scott, what do you want from me? Obviously something I can't have anymore. Don't you dare try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. And now suddenly, for one night, you need me again? Well, I can't do that. I can't be more than just your friend because I know exactly what'll happen. A few weeks from now and you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again. Is that what you think? You think I didn't need you? That's what you think? Well, if you did, you never showed it. Oh, Ronnie. Look, listen to me. Listen. Look at me. Look at me. In my whole life, I never in my whole... You expecting somebody? This night is just getting better and better. Where are my keys? They're here on the table where you always leave them. Hey, baby, I thought you... Hey. Greg Barnett. Excuse me. Hey, Mike. If you weren't family I'd fucking kill you. You told Antonucci you got that shit from me? Don't say shit. What the fuck's the matter with you? I'm sorry, Mike. Sorry about what? He's got respect for you, Mike. He was gonna try and lowball me. Yeah, and what the fuck do I use you for, Clarence? To be a walkin', fuckin' advertisement. I'm sorry, Mike. You're sorry? Antonucci never flipped on anybody before. He said he had the cops paid off. Not the cop that showed up at my door! What happened, Mike? Mike. I'm sorry, Mike. Two days, I could've taken that fuckin' store. Now I can't even show my face. I got a couple thousand bucks, Mike, if you need to leave town. Leave town? They're gonna know me in Des Moines by now. Ten million dollars, Clarence. Ten million fuckin' dollars! I could've disappeared. I could've had it made! That's all right, Clarence. I'll just stick around and take care of you for the rest of my fuckin' life. Did you k-kill him, Mike? Oh, god. I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry, Mike... Mike... I didn't know, Mike. I fucked up, Mike. I fucked up, man. Oh, fuck. I'm fucked up. Come on. I didn't know. I didn't know, Mike. I messed up. Come here. It's all right. It's all right. I messed up. I messed everything up. It's all right. I didn't mean what I said. I'm sorry. It's not your fault you're stupid. Eiko! What you got on korda? We ran a search on relatives. He's got a cousin in town, Clarence teal, small-time thief. Last known address was on pine street. He moved a month ago. We've got a couple of leads to check. Did you check with DMV about vehicle registration? It's being faxed over now. How about the record room for any incident reports? We can get medical records. Have somebody check with burglary detail. See if they know him and if... Look, roper. We've... forensics on two. And bars. Find out the kind of bars he used to frequent. Scott, we're into it. I'm into this shit. Roper, we've already had this conversation. You are not&gt; Active on this case. It's in everyone's best interest. Well, y'all are doing good work here. I'm... Sorry about your friend. I lost somebody in SWAT. I know it's rough. I appreciate your concern, but let's just leave it at that. What's this you're reading? Strategies and countermeasures in hostage situations. You're not having too much progress with this thing either. Oh, wait, no. You really had me stumped. Very impressive. You get an "a." See, no force was required. No damage was done. All right? That was your partner? Yeah. Why'd he do that? Well, he figured the kid had a zero percent chance of survival. I guess he thought his odds were better. We had a plan, then SWAT opened up fire too early, and a perp took out my partner. You remember this. You always use your eyes to keep that connection. That's the most important thing. It's like hypnosis. Right. You connect with them. You're always on their side. Okay. How much money you got on you? What's that? How much money you got? I don't know, like 100 bucks. Why? Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, ten minutes to post. You know why I like coming to the track? Yeah. You're a compulsive gambler. No. The multitude of possibilities. Everything is here for you to see if you know what conditions to look for. Mm-hmm. Just like a hostage situation. See the four horse? Mm-hmm. Droppin' in class, no works, front wraps, all broken down. You wouldn't bet on him, right? Right. Wrong. You bet on him. 'Cause see the woman with the big belt buckle. That's the owner of the horse. And that belt buckle is a championship belt buckle. She wouldn't come out here with a fancy buckle on unless the horse was live. We go with him. That's how you pick your bets? By belt buckles? Well, just trust me now. You see the horse next to that. That's the favorite. Lookin' all washy, foamin' in the mouth, lookin' all rank and shit. Supposed to be the favorite. He don't even feel like runnin'. We don't go with him. He's out. Okay. Now, the six horse. The six horse looks great. A shiny coat, that bouncy walk. That horse is live. And that trainee/jockey combo? You can't lose on that. What do you think? I got two WORDS FOR YOU: Seek help. Oh, and I have three words for you: Exacta. Come on. And away they go! Come on! Come on! Okay, we're in good shape. We're in good shape. Six horse is last. Don't worry about that. That's his style. What? To run last. To run late. See! The favorite's fading and the four horse is in the lead. Just like I said. Our guy is still last. Don't worry. He'll be runnin' at the quarter pole. Come on, six horse! Come on, Russell. We need first and second. First and second. Come on, Russell. Who's Russell? The jockey. Come on, Russell. Come on, Russell! How much do we win? Eight hundred dollars. Come on, Russell. We win $800? Come on, Russell. Eight hundred dollars. Come on, Russell. Come on, Russell. Russell! Get that 800, Russell. Come on! Let's go, Russell! Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell! Way to go! Way to go! Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Come on! Come on! Go! We won! We won! Oh, shit. We lost. We won! We won! We lost! You wanna bet? You wanna bet on whether we just won? What, are you crazy? Russell, you midget fuck! You little midget m... we won! We won! We won! We won! Hey, we won! Way to go, Russell. Way to go, Russell. Hey, Russell! Don't worry about him, Russell. Hey, Russell, it's cool. Whoo! How long you been coming here? About six years. My old partner turned me on to this place. Is it always like this? Well, occasionally you lose, but today we are winners. That's right. Pay the winners, please. Oh, Benjamin. Benjamin looks so sad. I'm in such a wonderful mood. Here you go. There's your share. Wait, wait. That's only three. What? Oh, you got good eyes. That's part of your training. That's right. I was making sure you can... Hello. Okay. I'm on my way. Let's go. Gonna need another R. A. Unit! The police are approaching. What's the 10-20 on the incident? Shreve, right on the corner. Man, this looks like a shit sandwich. Yeah. You see this car? I'm riding around in a shitmobile, and Solis got this out of impound for 14 grand. It's worth at least 30. Police corruption's everywhere. Bastard. Where's Solis? Right. Okay. You relax. Joe... Joe... Thirty-two minutes ago, the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. There was a unit about a block away. The suspect got trapped inside. You got any verification on numbers? So far, we've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself Joe. Now there's no confirmation, but there could be more. An employee escaped through the rear door. As far as we can ascertain, there's two jewelers, two salespeople, a manager, security guard, elderly woman; We believe one other female. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. On any given day, they can have between eight and ten million in raw stones. They knew what they were lookin' for. What have you promised them? Just that I'd talk to my superiors. Locate any points of entrance? This place is designed to be a vault. Okay. Tape's rolling. Yeah. Hello, Joe. I'm inspector roper. How you people doin' in there? Good. Solis is off the job now. I'm the guy who's authorized to give you everything you want. First, I gotta talk to you. No, you don't. Yes, I do, Joe. I have come down there, and I have to talk to you... To make sure that there are no misunderstandings... And make sure nobody is hurt in there before we can take care of business. All right, roper. You wanna come? Come. Listen. I'm not armed, okay? We gotta operate on trust here. I'm not armed. I'm gonna talk to you and get you guys out of there. Five minutes. This is obviously the part of the job that sucks. Hey, hey, hey. How can he be sure the guy won't shoot him? He can't. Right there. Can I put my hands down? Where I can see 'em. You're roper, and you're in charge, right? Yep. Good. You listen up. I say this one time. I want a four-wheel drive. New, perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop. Drive it up right here. Leave the engine running. He walks to the end of the block. Then we'll come out. I know all the tricks, so no remote control devices, okay? When I say perfect condition, I mean, if it's low in wiper fluid, someone gets shot, and we'll start again. I want a plane waitin' at the airport. I'll tell him where I'm goin' when I get there. Is that all? For now, that's all. Okay, you're gonna get all those things, but first you gotta do something for me. Let me come inside and make sure everybody's all right. You just do shit for me right now. Wait a minute, Joe. I'm doin' a lot for you, okay? You gotta do somethin' for me. You gotta show an act of good faith. Let me have one hostage. I give you somethin'. Here. In 15 minutes, it'll be a bigger piece. We understand each other? Yeah, we understand each other. Good. No, no, no, please. No, sir, not to the best of my knowledge. That's correct. That's right. He's here right now. Let me get back to you. We're gonna have to take this guy out. Well, can't we wear him down? I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. I think it was gunfire that set the fire alarm off. I think this guy is working by himself 'cause the whole time I was talkin' to him... He had a hostage and he had a gun to her head, and he wouldn't leave the door. He's got a real calm and creepy demeanor. The guy's a fucking wacko. The scariest thing about him is he indicated familiarity with our techniques. So what do you want to do? You wanna go in there or wait for him to come out? Let him come out. There's too many unknowns. He's right. Show me. When we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet away from the curb. We put our best man high ground. Is Anderson here? Yes. Good. Okay, twenty degrees down angle. Tell Anderson to prep and notify us when he's on line. I can feel this thing going sideways on us. Well, there's some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity, and he hasn't determined whether or not he's gonna kill the rest of the hostages... yet. You. You! Up, up! Start pullin' those bodies back behind that counter. Let's go. Do it! Move! Let's go. Come on! Back behind here. Faster! Let's go! He's gonna... he's gonna kill us. Please. It's gonna be... Over there. In there. I'm not, I'm not staying here. I'm not staying here. No, no, please don't, please don't. Mrs. Dotson, please don't go. Mrs. Dotson, please! Hey! Hey! Stop, miss Dotson. Hey! Leave her alone. What? Leave her alone. Think. Doug, please, sit down, sit down! If she's not conscious by the time I'm done, she's dead. What do you got, window? We have confirmation... Okay, it's time to give this wacko a call. How come he's not answering? Wait, wait, wait. There's your answer. He's smart. He's cuttin' down visibility. Yup. He's doin' a good job of it. You have a green light. Come on. Give us one clean shot, asshole. Command one, repeat. All POSITIONS: You have a green light. He switched clothes. That's korda! That's korda! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I said hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! No, no, no. Please, let me go! Come on. In this truck. Get in! Please! Bunch of fuck ups. Get him on the radio. These your keys? What? Yeah, yeah. He's got a girl. Let's go. Hey, roper, what are you gonna do? Additional units in the area. We need all additional units in the area. Oh, oh, please, god. Hey, watch it! Stop! Please! Suspect heading west on Sutter, passing Laguna. Can we get an intercept? Move! Come on now! Let me out! Please! Shut up. Everybody okay? Just stay there, man. What's going on? Hey, man, what's this? Get the fuck off. Everybody, just stay calm. Just take it easy. What? Just take it easy. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. What the fuck is going on? I don't know, but I gotta get up there. What's going on here? Shit! Get the fuck off me! Hold the wheel! Take the wheel! What? Got it? Got it? Shut up! Get outta the way. What's the problem? I can't get the brakes to work! We're coming to the end of the line! Oh, shit. Get the car steady! Come on! Go! Move ahead! Hard right! Get outta the way! Get outta the way! Move! Oh, my god! Look at that! What the hell is that? Outta the way! Outta the way! Move! That guy down there... there, there! He's running! Hey, he's getting away! Somebody stop him! Get him! Shit! I lost my piece! God bless SWAT. Ready? You take this floor. I'm goin' up. Shit! Stop there! Don't you move! Don't you fucking move! Stay right there! Right there! Put your hands up! Put 'em up! Spread your fucking legs. You fucking move, I'll put your fucking head in the trunk. Sam baffert was a friend of mine. He had a wife, and he had a daughter! Why don't you tell that to somebody who gives a shit? Want to kill me, inspector? Huh? You can't kill me. Oh, I can't? What if we got into a struggle, and my gun went off? Could I kill you then? Huh? Could I kill you then? Roper! You got him. Put the gun down. You got him, man. Put it down. Come on, man, put it down. I'm gonna do this shit by the book, but you ain't gonna be fucking smiling at me! Give me your hands. Come up. Get up. Get up. Come on. Listen, I'll catch up with you guys later. Okay. See you. Want to get something to eat? Yeah. You weren't at the press conference. I wanted to get this out of the way first. Have you got a bet on the game tonight? As a matter of fact, I do have a bet on the game tonight. Of course you do. Then you know it's already started. Well, I was going to catch the last half on TV later on. Well, good night. You having dinner with Mr. Baseball? Greg is actually on a road trip. I was just gonna go home and make myself some pasta. Mmm, "go home and make some pasta"? The one with the garlic and the oil that I like so much? No, the kind you get out of a box. The macaroni and the cheese. The instant&gt; Macaroni? Mmm. I've been craving that stuff all week. Yeah, it's hard to get. Oh, who are you telling? Just dinner. Yeah, just dinner. What the fuck... you bring me all the way over here to tell me you ain't got no collateral? Who do I look like to you? Santa Claus? I'm a fucking bail bondsman. I know, I know. That's not what I'm saying. Pick up the phone. You think I got time to be messing around with this crap? I got the stuff on the outside. I'm just waiting for somebody to cash it in. It's real simple. Give me a fucking break. Look, give me your card. I'll get it to you by tomorrow night. Thanks. Okay, now that's the freshly ground pepper, stirred briskly. Are you listening? You stir it briskly. Then you need lemon. I need lemon. There should be one in the fridge. Lemon in the refrigerator. You know, the last quarter of the game is on. Oh, really. What game is that? Oh, whoa, you are making an effort. That's right, and I'm gonna win too. I am going to be the Victor. I'm going to score. Metaphorically speaking, of course. I didn't mean like really scoring. Just dinner, remember. I know the rules. Just dinner, just dinner. Okay, I got this lemon in here. Now, when you taste this, I want you to know that you're going to be experiencing culinary perfection. Mmm. Now just calm down. I'm giving you the background on this. This is the bomb salad dressing that I bring... To all the cookouts whenever my family gathers. Mm-hmm. They say, "Scott, bring it, Scott." You ready? Taste this. Huh? Is that not the bomb? That is the shit right there. Mmm. Honestly, something's missing. Oh, no, that's not missing anything. You're just jealous 'cause you don't know how to... See, in the U. K., they don't teach you how to make this. See? This is perfection. You know, it does need a little sugar. Why don't you put your finger in there for the proper sweetness? Scott. That's a joke. That's a compliment to you. I could have said, "why don't you put your ass in this bowl?" That's a joke. It's all sweetness. I don't see how you're offended because that's a compliment. If somebody told me to put my ass in a bowl of salad dressing, I would be complimented. What would you say if I gave up gambling? I'd say you'd be miserable. It's not so much the gambling. It's more what the gambling got in the way of. The track is where you would take your troubles instead of sharing them with me. Scott, do you remember when you lost that hostage on union square? Yes, I do. You came here that night, and you made love to me, and it was so intense and so passionate. But you hadn't even talked to me. I didn't even know what happened until I saw it on the news the next morning. That's because I don't want you to be part of that world, Ronnie. Yeah, that's the point. It's not "that world." It's your world. It's part of who you are. Look, Ronnie, it's not easy for me. I know I can't change overnight, but, listen to me, I know that I miss you, and I don't ever want to be without you again. I'd really like to believe you. Well, then believe me. Nobody asked you anything. I missed you. I'm officer McCall. What's going on? What the fuck do you mean, "what's going on?" I'm about to fucking waste everybody in here, pal! Okay, I'm a hostage negotiator. I'm here to help you. How the hell are you gonna help me, pig? Screw you, man! Fuck you, dude! Well, I want you to tell me what you need. What do I need? I tell you what I fucking need, man! I need you to fuckin' find that dirtbag... That fuckin' ran off with my wife, dude, so I can cut his fuckin' balls off, man! Okay, I can't do that. You can't fuckin' do it? Then why am I wasting my fuckin' time with you, man! You piece of fuckin' frog shit, piece of shit asshole! Hey, hey, is all the name-calling necessary? I don't like the verbal abuse. No, not really, but I like to throw all that in there... To kind of give it the natural ambiance, you know. I'm officer McCall. I'm unarmed. I just wanna make sure everybody gets outta here safely. Stop right there. Close your eyes. Okay. Tell me what you see. I see a scumbag behind the counter... With a sawed-off, nine millimeter tucked away in his waistband. There's a female hostage down in front of the cereal rack with a red polka-dot dress. Another hostage three feet to her right with blue jeans and a checkered shirt. A male hostage down; Green shirt, white pants, in front of the candy rack. There's a female scumbag behind me with a gun tucked away in her shirt, trying to pass herself off as a hostage. And there's a special on TOILET PAPER: Four for $1.29. That's a lot of toilet paper. Am I right? That's pretty good. You got good eyes. You like that? Very impressive. How you doing, Mike? You doing all right? How the fuck do you think I'm doing? Now, I got something I want you to do for me. This fucker, roper... He's got a girlfriend. She works the newspaper. So, what do you want... what... Oh, Mike... no, Mike, come on. You know that's not my thing. Hey, don't give me any shit, Clarence. I'm in here because of you. Mike, come on, man. You know, you... You were just robbing the store, and he was doing his job. Fuck you! Oh, Mike... I carried you your whole life. Hey, you needed money. You needed a place to stay. You were strung out. Bail. This time you are there for me. Mikey, don't do this to me, please. You do it! I ain't gonna get away with it, Mike. You just fuckin' do it! Guard! Fuck. Hello. Hey, how you doing? I'm gonna stop at the corner and get some wine. I got the bread already. Dinner will be ready soon. Okay. Good. I'm starving. All right. I'll see you later. Thanks. That all for you? Ow. No! No! Help me! Help me! Ronnie! Ronnie! You okay? Yeah. Watch it! If you try to hurt me or anybody else I know, I swear to god... I'm gonna find a way to get in here, and I'm gonna bust your fuckin' ass! Then I'm gonna put my gun in your mouth and blow your fuckin' brains out. You understand? I don't even know what you're talkin' about. You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. No, I'm afraid I do not. Don't fuckin' play games. You know what the fuck I'm... no, I don't. You don't know what the fuck I'm talkin' about? You see this guy here? That's your cousin, right? Well, the guy with the white gloves on is the coroner. That's what the fuck I'm talkin' about! I'm talkin' about not playing with me, motherfucker! Don't fuck with me, man! I'm not playin' with you! You know, in Naples, there's an expression: When you think you're fuckin' them, they're fuckin' you. Well, you know what? You ain't in motherfuckin' Naples right now! Fuck that Naples shit! Did you hear what the fuck I just told you? I don't give a fuck about anything or anybody. Not now. Least of all a nigger cop interferes with what's mine. And what is mine is $10 million worth. You come in here, you threaten me, show me a photo of my dead cousin, my family. I got at least ten years in here... To figure out exactly how to fuck with you... And everything you care about. Hey, fuck you! You say you don't give a fuck? I don't give a fuck neither! I don't give a fuck about you! Fucker! Try me! Fuckin' try me and see what the fuck... get the fuck off me! You try me! You enjoy San Francisco, huh? Oh, I love it. Have you been to the de young museum? Cheers. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you so much. It has an excellent nose. It's quite vintage, and you may serve it up. Thank you. This evening's specials, we have grilled squab... With a sweet potato, foie gras spring roll... With a wild huckleberry sauce. We also are offering braised sweetbreads with white truffle sauce... On cracked bulgur. "Cracked bulgur"? Mm-hmm. You know, my mouth has been screaming for some cracked bulgur all week. Can we have a couple of minutes to look at the menu, oh, sure. Take your time. Maybe see something else? Man can't live on cracked bulgur alone. Nice place, huh? Yeah, I think it's really nice. A bit expensive though. Very, very, very expensive. In fact, it's costing me quite a pretty penny... To wine and dine you in such fashion, so I hope you're appreciative of it. Mmm, but I think I'm worth it. I think you're worth it too. In fact, this is the perfect setting for my little plan. You see, I know you know... There's a very important reason why I wanted to have dinner with you tonight. I didn't realize that at all, no. Veronica, this last week has been incredible for me. You know, I... I feel like our relationship went to the next phase or something... And kind of crystallized into this new thing and... I'm hoping that the feeling is mutual. Well, of course it's mutual. Good, because, Veronica, there comes a time in every relationship... When things get more serious. Yeah. The last week... I have rehearsed this so many times. I've been sitting and trying to figure out the best way to do this, and I said this is the perfect setting. You've got the perfect dress and the perfect face and... I think I should just show you. Oh, no, no. Listen... We haven't even spoken about this, Scottie. This is going to be really embarrassing. Come on, please, can we... Eh? Tahiti? Tahiti, yes. Vacation. Yes, a vacation to Tahiti. You and I. Two trips. Round-trip tickets to Tahiti. Yes? Yeah, that I will do. All right. What do you mean, "that"? What'd you think I was going to ask you? Well, come on. The way you were talking... oh, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go to Tahiti first. Make it a little road test. So are we going to Tahiti? Did you say yes? That is a yes. We're going to... we're going to Tahiti. Stop it. We're going... hey, they're not gonna be there. They ain't gonna never see us no more. Let's toast it. To Tahiti. To being "nekked" in Tahiti. Come on, say it. "Nekked in Tahiti." Naked in Tahiti. Not "naked in Tahiti." That's how I say it. "Nekked." "nekked." There you go. Say, "nekked in Tahiti." Hold it. Let me picture you nekked. Oh, look at the sun bouncing off your ass. I'm sorry. If it's not here by 5:00, it's not my problem. Don't talk to me about Mitch. I'm running this shift, not Mitch. I don't care. Got another load. Yeah, rack 'em. Yeah, well you got the memo from city hall too, right? I've got 'em right here. No, they went down at 9:30 to San Bruno. Yeah, they've got the old forms. The new forms have the wrong date or something. '91 or '92, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, well, don't give me any grief about it. No, Frank told me. Look, I can't spend any more time on this. Okay? That's it. All done. Yeah. Well, no. Well, you can tell that to Mitch too. Okay? Don't call me on this anymore. Yeah, well, don't give me any grief about it. Hey, don't you guys keep notes down there? How come, in those foreign movies, the young girl always falls in love... With the old, fat guy? I guess women in Europe find older men sexy. Shit. When I get old and fat, I'm definitely moving to Europe. That guy was 60 years old. Shit. I forgot to feed Troy. I bet he's starving. Troy, where are you, baby? I'm sorry. Troy? Troy, where are you hiding? Troy? My eyes are still hurting from reading that movie. Troy, I've got food for you. Troy? Where are you? Scott, have you seen... Hey, baby, there you are. Yes. Hey, have you been eating my face soap again? You have, haven't you? Scott, what is it? Korda escaped. Korda's escaped? This morning. You don't think he'd try and... I-I'm just a little on edge. I need to relax. I'm sure he's gonna try to get out of town, and we're leaving tomorrow anyway, you know? I'm sorry about that. I just overreacted. Okay? Okay? Why don't we feed the dog before we have cujo on our hands, huh? You packed everything? You sure you didn't forget your bowling ball or... you know? I sent that ahead, you wise guy. You're bringing a lot of clothes to a place where you're not supposed to wear clothes. Don't you think it'd be better if you stayed in the house 'til you're ready to get outta here? No, I'm gonna stay here and help you guys. No, I'm not playing. I think you should go in the house, you know? Hold up a second. We are going to Tahiti. We're gonna have a great time. You are gonna forget everything. Everything. So just calm down. I'm calm. Don't I look... look at me. See? I just think it'd be better if you went in the house, all right? I'll get my cameras, then I'll be straight back. Take your time, all right? Man. You've gotta relax. Hey, I'm relaxed. You gotta calm down. Hey, man, I don't want nothing else to go wrong. Ronnie, come on now. Veronica? Come on! We gotta be there an hour and a half early to check in. What are you doing? Come on, Ronnie. Hey. Ronnie, how long it take to get some camera equipment, huh? Ronnie? Veronica? What's that, Troy? Is she out there? Is she? Watch it. Hey, Veronica? Roper, what's up? What is it? You missing something, roper? I got it. Now you got something that belongs to me, and I want it back. 4:15 tomorrow. Mare island, north entrance, off Dixon. You pull up to berth 16. I so much as smell another cop, I'll be sending you pieces of her for a month. He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him those jewels, he's gonna kill me and her. So what do you want to do? Scott, we go back a long ways, but you can't expect me to do this. This guy is a psychopath, and he has Ronnie. It's the only way I'm gonna get close to him. Then go to the lieutenant or the D. A. With it for Chrissakes! This is my fucking job you're asking me to lay on the line. They're not gonna approve it, and you know that. If I get the department involved, she's dead. This guy's a fucking maniac. He killed Sam, and he'll kill her. I got one shot at this guy, Frank. Alone. Now what if it was Mary? You'd do the same thing. You'd break every rule in the book. Wouldn't you? I just hope to god I never have to make that decision. This conversation never happened. I never saw you today. Now I gotta go take a leak. This place is an abandoned shipyard. He's gonna be able to get a good vantage point from anywhere. There's cranes, abandoned buildings, everything. He's gonna be able to see everything we do. You're gonna have to figure out a way to sneak me in here. Korda! Korda! Roper! Nice of you to make it. Now take the jacket off and put it on the hood. Good. Let's have a look at that tarp. Under the tarp in the back. Pull it back. Pull it back! Over there to your right. You see that concrete block? There's a radio on it. Walk to it. That's it. Come on. Come on! Come on. Ah. Before you touch it, you throw away your piece. Good. Your backup too. Do it! Pick up the bag. Bring it to me. You walk past those cranes on your right. You get to the end, you make a left. At the end of that building, you go to your right. Walk to building 36. That's it. Keep coming. That's good. Right there. Come on in. Somebody's dying to say hello. Shit. Scott! Shit. Hey. Over to the table. Open your shirt. I'm not wearin' a wire. This is between me and you. Fuck you. Open the shirt. Okay? Where are you, McCall? Right here, roper. You satisfied? Open the bag, dump it on the table. Pick something up. What? Nope. Closer to the front of the pile. There. Let's go. Stay put. That's impressive. What the fuck did you have to do, steal 'em? Yeah, I stole it. That ain't gonna look too good on the ol' service record. You let me worry about that. Let's just get this shit over with, all right? A man after my own heart. Here you go. Fill it up. Come on, man, bring him out. Move him out. Step up. That's far enough. Right there. Bag on the floor. I'm not putting the bag on the floor. I took care of my part of this shit. Now you let my girl go. Scott, just do what he says! Please, just do it! Hey, Ronnie, relax. I'm gonna get us out of here. That I gotta see. Just a little more. No! No! Scott! Hey! Back off. Don't move. Shit. Damn it. I rewired this switch. So you keep your finger... On the red button. Otherwise, it gets kind of messy. Such a nice neck too. Shit. Now walk to me. That's it. Right there. Right there. Put the bag down. Now, real nice, you kick over what's mine. Oh, no! Please, Scott! Remember what I said? Remember that? When you think you're fuckin' them, they're fuckin' you. You just got fucked. Gotta go. Got a plane to catch. Oh, shit, look at this. Got my car here, and that's the only exit, the only way out. You're standing right in front of it. Now, you can move, but... Scott, what's he doing? Damn. Scott, move. Get out of the way! Do it now, Scott! McCall, stop the... What car? Please move! Take a shot! Come on, Scott! Please! Come on! Please, help me! Come on, Scott! Scott! Stay in here. No! Wh... Stay inside, Ronnie! Stay here! McCall! He went around that way. Fuck, man! How bad you hit? He went down that way. You all right? I'm okay. Get him! Hey! Motherfucker! Get the fuck open! ♪ Oh, really? Nice, huh? I'll show you. I've never seen a sky so blue and sea so clear. This place is amazing. Yep, I could really get used to this paradise shit. Oh, excuse me, miss. Can you get me another Pina Colada, and this time can you shave the ice for me? Oui, monsieur. Right away. "Oui, monsieur. Right away." That's very nice to hear. Mademoiselle. Oui, merci. "Mademoiselle." "oui, merci." Au revoir. Au revoir. That's some smooth shit, French. Scott... There's something really special I want to talk to you about. What's that? I think it's time for this relationship to go to another, deeper level. A deeper level? I think this is it. Here and now, we should strip down... And get "nekked" in Tahiti. Oh, you talking about getting naked in Tahiti. I thought you was talking about the "m" word just now when you was... The "m" word? What did you think I was talking about? You know. What, marriage? Why are you laughing? The way you said all that we need to go to a deeper level. But you did say that you would get naked on the beach in Tahiti. No, I didn't say, "naked on the beach in Tahiti." I said, "let's get naked in Tahiti." The hotel room is in Tahiti too. I'm not gonna get naked on the beach. You're a prude. I'm not a prude. I'm just not... these are strangers. Prude. I'm not getting naked on no beach. We could go to the room, I'll take off my clothes and run around naked for you. Incidentally, that thong in the suitcase, that's not getting worn on the beach. Sorry. Yeah, I'm very disappointed. You didn't even try it on, and I bought it for you. That's for me? Imagine me in some shit like that. You actually bought that for me? It would look cute on your ass. Right. Yeah. Girl, please. What if one of my mother's friends was here and seen me walking around in that shit? Don't bring your mother into this. It's a small world. Somebody that knows my mother, sees me in that shit, then they, "oh, girl, Mrs. Roper's son be on the beach in Tahiti... "With his ass out on his vacation. Watch him, girl. Mm-hmm. I seen he had a string up his ass." Get the fuck outta here. Not today.
