Directed by Kaneto Shindo YAIZU HARBOR I'm counting on you. Head Fisherman TAMIO MISHIMA Radio Operator AIKICHI KUBOYAMA Hey look alive! «What’s up? - Hey Do a good job. Ship Manager YOICHI NISHIYAMA Hey! JANUARY 22, 1954 Bishop takes rook! Here comes white up your ass! Knight thrusts in saying, “Show some tits!“ Dammit! Map of the Pacific I hope we catch 64 tonnes this time. Last time in the Indian Ocean we caught 56 tonnes. Yeah, if we get 64 tonnes and take our commission... then I could at least buy Ma an underskirt! - Odd. We're headed in the wrong direction. - What? Where are we going? We're headed east. I didn't tell everyone yet, but I thought we'd try fishing out east. That's news to me. I thought we were going to the Solomons, right, guys? Yeah, that's right. Hey... There's no way this old boat can handle the seas out east. I only just learned of it from the Chief here myself. He thinks that rather going to the south to catch cheap yellow-fin tuna, it'd be better to catch the pricier big-eye tuna out east, even if it's rough. Out east is bound to be rough. I'm for the south. A load of cheap yellowfin tuna would still be good money I talked it over with Ship Manager Nishiyama; he says let's take a chance and search east for big-eye tuna. How about it, Kuboyama? Well, I guess he has final say over the boat... So let's head for Midway Atoll. - If Kuboyama's for it, so am I. - I'm glad we all agree. Let's scoop up those big-eyes and make loads of money! From Ogasawara Islands past Minami Torishima island Good work. I'll take over now. You're pretty good with a knife, Chief. Have a taste. Just right. Talking in your sleep, eh? I can't help it. «Kiyo-chan! Oh, Kiyo-chan!» «I want to be with you, Kiyo-chan!» Stop it, Mr Harada! Dinner's ready! The chief made curry rice for us. From Minami Torishima Island to Midway Atoll The temperature's about right... The water colour looks fine, too. Ready to go for it? Drop the lines! Please catch us many fish. Go ahead! Go ahead! Bring in the lines! Damn it, another shark... You greedy beggar! Perhaps the tuna are away on holiday! Keep trying- The lines have broken! Turn the ship! The sea's too rough... - Must've got caught in the coral. - There's a strong current, too. Hey keep a lookout! We've not found any in four days. Let's give it up. I feel bad for the ship owner and the men. All we'll bring back from this voyage is debt. We can still use half of the lines. We'll make do with that. With only half, we'd be lucky to cover our costs. We shouldn't just keep hanging around here. I say we head south, to the calmer seas. Why not head north? We'd be closer to home and save fuel. We can still fish along the way Since we're low on fuel, how about going north for albacore tuna? Everyone's exhausted. The seas up north are too rough. We can be sure of a catch if we head south. Have you contacted the ship owner? No. I'll do it now. You can't always be lucky when fishing. I'll go tell everyone. Hey! Listen up, guys! Forget about the broken lines. We're heading south. A fisherman must know when to give up. It's a new start. We'll regain our energy by heading south. How about we break open that bottle of sake we've been saving! From Midway Atoll to Bikini Atoll Let it go. Be careful! MARCH 1st Harada, we'll return home to Yaizu after raising the lines. My Kiyo-chan will be dying to see me. «Oh, Kiyo-chan!» I can't wait to see her. It's frustrating! We can cover our costs provided we pull in 8 or 9 tons. What a terrible voyage! The ship owner will be angry - We'll have nothing but debts. - Breakfast is ready The sun rose in the west! Idiot! The sun can't rise in the west! Wasn't that an atomic bomb? What was that? Let's eat. Start the engine! Raise the lines! Full speed! The bang arrived seven minutes after the flash of light. No, it was eight minutes. Look! An atomic bomb! There may be airplanes around! Be on the lookout. Back to work! Raise the lines! The speed of sound is around 1,000 feet per second. Let's say it took 7.5 seconds... That would make it 75 nautical miles. The ship's position is... 11°53' north, 66°58' east. Stay off the radio - we can't risk being intercepted. What's this, snow? It doesn't snow in the south seas. What strange stuffs falling from the sky! Get back to work. Hurry up! - What the heck is this? - Could be ash. It sticks to my feet. What is this? MARCH 14th Just what have you guys been up to?! Boss, I need to talk to you. What happened to your face? I turned into a native Polynesian! Why is your face like that? Come on, let's talk. - Everyone's turned black! - I know. Come on. - Huh? You saw an atomic bomb explode? - We saw a flash of light... After 90 minutes, white ash began to fall. We were all covered with ash. It turned us black. Why didn't you contact us by radio? We'd have got in trouble if the U.S. military intercepted us. I made sure everyone's lips were sealed. - We could be captured as spies, you know. - How's everyone's health? Our hair falls out, and we have blisters. Your face really is black! How strange. I'd like to get looked over at the hospital. Sure, go right away... Wait, today's Sunday - There'll still be a doctor on duty - He's right. Call them now. Say that you must see him. You witnessed a top secret U.S. operation; it's over for you if they think you're a spy - Good morning! - Morning. Kiyo-chan, the Lucky Dragon is back in port. The Lucky Dragon? Look after this for me. Welcome back! What happened to your face? - I'm back. - Welcome home. What happened to your face? Who's darker, your dad or the fish? You look like a ghost! Hurry and wash your face, dear. Washing won't remove it. I'm going to the hospital. Your skin's turned very dark... You also have blisters. For how long did the ash fall? For about four hours. Did you wash it off afterwards? - We washed it off right away - Any fever? For a while we felt nauseous and lost our appetites. We also threw up and our hair fell out. How do you feel now? We feel fine. Since you feel fine and two weeks have passed, you may be alright. Let's take some blood samples, just in case. They appear to have facial burns. Rub some zinc ointment on them. Kyoriisu Hospital Do you think we'll be alright, doctor? Well, you saw a ball of fire, and ash fell on you. So I wonder... - Sorry to be rude, doctor... - Hmm? But we'd like to go to a hospital in Tokyo for examination. Fine. I'll write you a letter of introduction to Tokyo University Hospital. You may be suffering from radiation poisoning. Send the two worst affected to the hospital tomorrow morning. You kept some ash, right? Yes. We brought some home in a plastic bag. Good. Take it with you to the hospital. What happened? You look like Pacific natives who've been licking the flour bowl! Hey! Do mine next. Welcome back. We sure do look like natives who've licked the flour bowl! Won't you drop in? Come on, guys. Welcome back! My aren't you sunburned! Welcome back! You were gone so long. 50 whole days! A little something for you. So young and fresh, just like us! We're leaving now. How do you feel? Show this to the doctor. - Be sure to explain what happened. - Do you have the referral? Yes. We'll be going, then. Mr Masuda and Mr Yamazaki? «On March 1st, while fishing in the waters of Bikini Atoll, «23 crew members were exposed to fallout from a hydrogen bomb... «and show signs of radiation poisoning. Please examine them». That's correct. Your faces certainly are dark. We also brought this. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I'm back. - Keizo, I just heard something terrible... The Lucky Dragon was near Bikini Atoll when an atomic bomb exploded. Who said that? I just heard it from a manager at Fujikawa Fisheries. The captain of the Lucky Dragon asked one of their employees... for advice in writing a letter of protest. The manager overheard everything! Mother, when did it happen? I think he said on March 1st. March 1st? I read an article about that... America conducted a hydrogen bomb test in the Bikini Atoll. Mom, you'd better go upstairs and tell Kabe about it. He's out gathering news about a child murder in Shimada. Hello? Kabe, a phone call from Yaizu town. Hello, Kabe speaking. It's terrible. The Lucky Dragon crew saw a hydrogen bomb explosion! - What did you say? - Hey what is it? My old man came to visit? What bad timing. But I spent all my money on a camera. Not a camera, a hydrogen bomb! A big news story! You haven't spoken to reporters, I hope? To the phone. Hurry! Shizuoka Branch Office Huh? The Lucky Dragon was... on March 1st... in the Bikini Atoll... What? Did you say «Big Nick?» The Lucky Dragon was exposed to a hydrogen bomb test... in the Bikini Atoll on March 1st? Write a news story Find the captain and crew. And get some photos! Hurry UP! - Where are we going? - To the dock. Faster! Hurry UP- Slow down. I'm out of breath. What do you want me to shoot? Take a photo of the Lucky Dragon. This heap of junk? You're wasting your time. My boss wants a photo. I wonder why]? - Hurry! - No need to rush. Get to it! Hurry up, snap the picture! - What's the delay? - I can't find the photo plate. Ah, here it is... Take this. OK, Kabe, ready to take it? Japanese Fishermen Encounter Atomic Bomb Test on Bikini Atoll On March 1st, at Bikini Atoll, a Hydrogen Bomb Test 23 Men Suffer Radiation Poisoning One Person Serious at Tokyo University Hospital 23 crewmen of the tuna fishing boat Lucky Dragon No. 5, appear to be... suffering from radiation poisoning caused by fallout... from a hydrogen bomb test conducted over the Bikini Atoll on March 1st. They must be talking about us! There's only one Lucky Dragon No. 5... and that's us. Hey! A big news article about us! That's our boat! We're in deep water now! You're the crew of the Lucky Dragon... We'd like to ask a few questions. Union Chief, what a mess we're in! I was shocked when I read the paper. - What about your tuna catch? - We unloaded it yesterday Sanitation Manager, come here. I just got a call from the Prefectural Sanitation Dept. The Head of Sanitation will soon arrive. He wants all the crew members to gather here. How big was the atomic explosion? Tell me! - Where's the chief radio officer? - Beats me. - Where's the captain? - Dunno. - What is the city's response? - What about the tuna shipment? - Were the tuna loaded on trains? What about the crew members covered with radioactive ash? I can't respond, as I don't know anything myself. And my boss is sick in bed. The Head of Sanitation and a professor from Shizuoka University have arrived. A terrible situation we're in here! Radiology Professor Fujikawa, of Shizuoka University - I'm Fujikawa. - Thank you for coming. - I'm Omiya. - The Medical Chief. These are the crewmen. Their white blood cell count is low. What is that? A Geiger counter. It measures radioactivity This is serious! An extremely high radiation level. Look out, we'll get radiated! All of you show high levels of radioactivity Some exceed the permissible level. First, your hair must be shaved and your nails cut. Then bring your clothing and possessions to the Lucky Dragon. Boss, we can't get a barber. They're all too scared. Then you guys out their hair. You know how. - Go buy some clippers. - Yes. Outta my Way! Doctor, examine me with that crackling machine! I slept with one of the Lucky Dragon guys last night! I've caught the radiation disease! I want to know whether you kissed him. Did you? Well, did you kiss him? She did... she did! - Please, check me also. - You needn't worry Just in case... Hold on there! Where's the doctor's office? I ate the Lucky Dragon's tuna! How did it go? I'll be admitted to the Northern Hospital tomorrow. I wish I hadn't given any tuna to the neighbours... I don't know what to do now. Danger! Keep Out! Atomic Bomb Task Force Huh? What to do with their clippers? Dig a hole and drop them in! The Coast Guard verified that the Lucky Dragon was outside the no-sail zone. The research team from Tokyo University just arrived. First, they'll first look at the Lucky Dragon, then go to the hospital. Thank you for coming. Some bigshots from Tokyo University are here! - What types of radioactive particles were emitted? - We plan to find out. - How does this bomb differ from the Hiroshima one? - The crew has only a few days to live, I hear. - What is your course of treatment? - Is it true the patients will be sent to America? Check their level of radioactivity We have much experience of treating the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb victims, but this experience will not be sufficient if we cannot solve the problems with the ash. For this reason, we must quickly determine the nature of the ash. For humanitarian reasons, we want the U.S. to... quickly disclose the types of radioactive material contained in the ash. Why is it beneficial to learn the composition of the ash? Knowing this, we would be able to compare it with the radiation absorbed by the crew. Some radioactive elements quickly decay but others are more dangerous, with half-lives of over 20 years. We can't embark on treatment until we clearly know what was involved. A small amount of ash was collected on the Lucky Dragon; Professor Kinoshita is now analysing it. We want to quickly analyse the ash in order to aid their treatment. Chemical analysis can determine which elements are contained in the ash. Besides the Tokyo Uni team, there's Osaka Medical Uni, the Kyoto Uni Physics Dept, specialists from Tokyo, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs... A great nationwide mobilization, and they still have no idea how to treat the crew. The American Ambassador offered to assist with their treatment. I wonder want he wants to do. They conduct tests without warning, then offer to help. What opportunists! I hear there will be reparations. Of course. Those jerks were reckless. The chairman of the U.S. Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy Rep. Cole, said the crew may have been on a spying mission. The Foreign Secretary is irresponsible too. He says a small incident like this can't be helped, if it's to strengthen the cause of democracy The Lucky Dragon was clearly outside the no-sail zone, the Coast Guard Chief says. I'm relieved to hear that. Professor Minami of Tokyo University is a great help. He has kept a constant watch over them. Those pleural tap tests are scary A needle this big goes into their chests. The patients are worried they're being treated as guinea pigs. All they do is get tested. The Ministry of Health says the Hiroshima Atomic Injuries Investigation Committee... will send their Chief and a medical specialist by US. military plane tomorrow. Ash from Bikini Atoll: Strontium Detected Ash of Death: We Must Be Told its Composition Ash of Death: Analysis Report US-Japan Battle Over Investigation of Ash of Death US-Japan investigative Meeting Begins Ash of Death - Important Statement by Professor: 10% of Patients to Die? Is it Really a Joint U.S.-Japan Investigation? American Professor Lands at Haneda Airport, Refuses to Answer Questions Hello. Those are the bigshot U.S. committee members who created the atomic bomb. All they do is look, without saying a word. As the governor said, you cannot receive proper medical treatment here. You may be lonely leaving your families behind, but we cannot allow you to stay here and have your illness worsen. Some of you have requested that a doctor from Tokyo be sent here. Your care is best handled by the national government. We have arranged for your transfer to the Tokyo University and Dai-ichi hospitals. You'll use us as guinea pigs after we get to Tokyo, eh? That's not true. No one is treating you as research specimens. All you do is take our blood and we still get worse. We take blood in order to check your white blood cell counts. Just what is strontium? Is it true that strontium is inside our bodies? Once strontium gets into the body it never leaves, so I've heard. Recently it was reported that all of you tested positive for Strontium-90. I had wanted to avoid telling you this, but strontium is a... powerful radioactive element with a half-life of over 20 years. It was detected in the ash. Once inside your body it attaches to bones and impairs the production of blood cells. Removing Strontium-90 is very difficult. That will be one of our most difficult tasks as your doctors. You are the first ever victims of a hydrogen bomb. In truth, we must develop treatments alongside conducting research. We, the physicians and scientists of Japan, will do our utmost to treat you. I don't mind if they go to Tokyo, but what about us left behind? How will we survive? - The local authorities will be responsible for you. - Even if it takes two or three years? - Even if it takes two or three years. - What if they die? How about it? Go to Tokyo. Tomorrow, an American plane will pick you up at Shizuhama. I don't want to be in the hands of the Americans Look what they've done to us. They're playing games with us. They haven't said a word. They must first apologize to us. In your condition, going by airplane is for the best. Accept it as an expression of goodwill. They might take us away someplace, mightn't they? I will accompany you, so you need not worry How about it, Kuboyama? Won't you go? Guys... Let's go to Tokyo and recover our health quickly We can't work until we get better. Let's place our trust in the people in Tokyo. As governor, I accept responsibility for you as well as your families. Regardless of reparations, if the national government doesn't support you, Yaizu town and Shizuoka Prefecture will. Leave for Tokyo tomorrow and get well as quickly as possible. Please go to Tokyo knowing that your families will be taken care of. Look after the flower garden for me. Come home quick, okay Dad? UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO HOSPITAL TOKYO DAI-ICHI HOSPITAL I am Dr. Kumagai, the head physician. I'm sure you are tired. I want you to consider me as your friend, and I ask for your cooperation in the treatment. It may be rough at times, but I will do my best. Please tell me whatever is on your mind. Seven of you are at Tokyo Uni Hospital and 16 are here at Tokyo Dai-ichi Hospital. I hope that everyone here will return home in good health. Please take care of us. KYOTO UNIVERSITY MAY 30th Japanese Analytical Chemistry Society Forum On March 16th, I was asked by Tokyo University Hospital to... analyse the ash that fell on the Lucky Dragon. The newspapers refer to it as 'The Ash of Death'. Detecting the type and atomic weight of the radioactive elements contained... in the ash are paramount in establishing the best course of treatment. We put aside all of our other work... in order to focus solely on this task. As shown in the report at hand, over 30 different elements were detected, including Uranium-237, which is of great interest to me. While conducting nuclear fission experiments at the Riken Cyclotron before the war, we produced Uranium-237 particles by colliding... high-velocity neutrons with Uranium-238. By chance, once again I've encountered this particle in the ash from Bikini Atoll. Regarding the detected Uranium-237 particles, doesn't this help to reveal the design secrets of the uranium-encased H-bomb? I only know what I've detected. I have no further comment. The U.S. executed two citizens, the Rosenbergs, as reported in the American press, for suspected leaks of H-bomb secrets, secrets which Japan's scientists are now discovering. I have only detected which elements are contained in the ash. That's all I have to say on the subject. The Lucky Dragon is finally being stripped bare. They're breaking it up and taking it to a research lab. I feel sorry for the Lucky Dragon. Yes. It can't talk back to us. I wonder how their families are doing. It's rough when their husbands or sons are taken away I read in the paper that we now can't have children, because our sperm was destroyed. The guys are really disappointed. They won't be able to marry now. Don't worry Even if that's true, your body will produce more. We've all developed jaundice. Well, your white blood cell count's low, and your liver's malfunctioning. You needn't ask about every detail of your condition. I know... You doctors will be our saviours. We compile results of every medical test, report to Tokyo University and also send reports to America via the Foreign Ministry The world's doctors are all studying your condition. Doctor, a television set has been brought here for the patients. Something nice for you, Kuboyama. Hey guys, we can watch TV now. We arranged for it yesterday There's also one at Tokyo University Hospital. Hey guys: a treat for you all! Yaizu Since Then Let's took into the town of Yatzu, now famous the world over for the Ash of Death. It's our town, Yaizu! The fish market! Three months have passed since the Lucky Dragon returned home covered with ash. The rain contains radioactive particles that contaminates cities and their people. Yaizu looks to have finally returned to normal. Tuna fish, derisively called “atomic tuna,“ can now be seen at fish shops. At one point sushi chefs cried with anger They seem to be doing fine now. We asked the townsfolk about Yaizu since that time. Excuse me, Miss! The Yaizu fishermen suffered a lot. I feel sorry for them, but I'd never want to marry one of those guys. Why, you! I'll remember that face! - The idiot! - Who is that tramp? Don't worry Your girl won't leave you! I thought I'd be home in time for the festival. Let's go together next year. Sachiko, we'll be home in the fall, when the persimmons are ripe. The chrysanthemums will be blooming. Mrs. Kuboyama, I have a hard time sleeping in this bed. It doesn't sway! Me too. It needs to be swaying for me to sleep well. I can't sleep well unless the bed is tossing and turning! How about some rolled sushi? Thanks. - Sushi for you? - No, thanks. How about some sushi? Hey, Kimi! How about some sushi? It's not radioactive. - And some for the nurses. - Thank you. The Lucky Dragon crew is in good spirits! We owe it all to you, and the other nurses. Students from an elementary school in Gunma have come to visit you. They dropped in on the way back from the beach. We live in the mountains and went to the beach to escape the heat. We've come to visit you on the way back. Thank you. We haven't any gifts for you, but the students drew pictures at the beach. We hope they will cheer you up. The rest of the students are waiting out front. Please get well soon! Still awake? You must go to sleep early A bad habit of mine. I need to do it before I go to sleep. Doctor, how many kids do you have? One. She just turned three. Once I've finished knitting these for my kids, I'll knit one for yours, too. I'll look forward to it. I hope you can finish it soon. Strontium-90 is a pest. Once it enters your body you can't get rid of it. It won't go away Be positive. You can get rid of it once you regain your health. My body is falling to pieces. The Lucky Dragon will be moved to Tokyo tomorrow. - Oh? - Indeed. The Lucky Dragon must look run-down, too. Everyone's jaundice has improved, except for Kuboyama's. Why just him? Must be to do with age; the rest are younger. It's awful. If not for that atomic bomb, they'd never suffer such afflictions. As clinicians, we must treat them without complaint. I know, I just don't want any of them to die... You're right. What's going on, everyone? - She's finally here, his girl. - Harada's? He's as stiff as a kajiki tuna fish! Please have a seat. He's so excited. Maybe his white blood cells will increase! I finally talked Dad into seeing things my way... to wait until you're healed. Thank you! Thank you! «Dear Shizuko, today is very cool, with a breeze from the south. “Colour is finally returning to my face. «I think I can recover from the jaundice by the end of August. “My liver pain has gone away. «I feel more energetic. «Today! was awake for half a day and still wasn't very tired. «With a little more time I'll get better. «Take care of things at home, Shizuko». - How's he doing? - No change. Still in a coma. Hey! His wife and kids are here. His condition suddenly worsened. - Your wife is here. - Dear! Dear! Dear! Shizuko... You cut your hand. Dear, I didn't cut my hand. Airplane! Don't cut the flowers in the garden. Escape! Cut the lines! Mr Kuboyama! «Aikichi Kuboyama, Chief Radio Operator of the Lucky Dragon... «is in a critical condition and remains in a coma. «Aikichi Kuboyama suffered radiation poisoning after being covered... «with ash from a hydrogen bomb test in the Bikini Atoll. «His hear! has weakened considerably since yesterday evening. «The medical team is doing their best to see him through, «however, his condition remains serious». «Hang in there, Kuboyama!» - from the Yoshino Maru No. 8 crew. «Kuboyama, Hang in there!» - from the Eiko Maru crew. «Kuboyama, Don't die!» - from the Hinode Maru crew. «Hang in there, Kuboyama!» - from the Maru Fuku Maru No. 3 crew. Hang in there, Mr Kuboyama. Your friends out on the south seas send you... many words of encouragement. All these telegrams are for you! Dear... Yasue, Miyoko and Sachiko are here, too. Your mother and brother are also here, together with the ship-owner. Aikichi... is it painful? Aikichi, you're going to die, after all. Mom... I won't die. I'm going to go to sea again. The Chief is talking again! Kuboyama has regained consciousness! The children have school. We will come back. He's in a very unstable condition. We'll contact you if he deteriorates. Please do. I'll stay and watch over him. You should all go home. We're home, Sachiko. - Mom, I'm hungry - Let's eat something. Mrs Kuboyama! - Are you there, Mrs Kuboyama? - Yes! - Did you hear on the radio? - No. What happened? Your husband has lapsed into a critical condition. Everyone, please come next door. Don't give up, Mr Kuboyama. - Chief! - Chief! Hang in there, Mr Kuboyama. Electricity's burning me... A high-voltage line's running through me! Chief! He's in his final moments. - Dear! - Aikichi! A news flash: At 6:56 today Aikichi Kuboyama, Chief Radio Operator of Lucky Dragon No. 5, died of radiation poisoning in Room 311 of Tokyo Dai-ichi Hospital. Despite the prayers of 80 million Japanese, despite treatment by the worlds top radiologists, Aikichi Kuboyama, who was exposed to the 'ash of death' at Bikini Atoll last March, and whose case was known around the world, passed away at the age of 40. Autopsy Room Odawara Station... Shizuoka Station... Yaizu Station... SECRETARY OF STATE «Aikichi Kuboyama, «I first heard of you after learning of your exposure to fallout in the Bikini Atoll. «I first met you at the Tokyo Dai-ichi Hospital, after hearing of your serious condition. «But, as you inched closer and closer to death's door, «your indomitable spirit and bravery in determinedly battling your illness... «made me feel as though you were a dear old friend».
