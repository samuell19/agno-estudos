What do you want? You're not drownin' there, are you, Tess? You wish. You're gonna be late for school. Thanks for getting the skim this time. Don't make sense to me, pay money for that. It seems only water. I thought you were supposed to be in school? No. There's a substitute. She just puts on a movie. I'll go tomorrow. You want some? No, I'm not long finished my lunch. Lisa asked me to move in. 'Kay... What am I supposed to do then? I don't know, girl. You're old enough to stay here by yourself, aren't you? It is your house. She's got a spare room: Danny's old room. I can ask about it if you want. Anyway, I'm sure she wouldn't mind if you stayed there. I'll think about it. Gerry and I are moving into Lisa's. You're movin' in to Lisa Sharpe's? Yeah. Gerry wants to. I don't know. He's like, so weird about me staying at home alone, so I'm just goin' with it. So you're gonna live in Danny Sharpe's house? - Yeah. - I think my sister still has his CD. I can steal it for you if you want. Yeah. That'd be wicked. Tess, you mind staying back for a minute? OK. I'm glad to see you back in school. You missed a lot of days. I didn't miss that many. Tess, if you miss many more, you're not gonna be able to graduate. Listen... I know it's been a really hard year. I could set up a meeting with the guidance counsellor. Just to talk. I think it might help. No. I'll graduate. Oh, God. This fella's still kicking! Hand me up the axe there, would you? Ugh... He's a lively bugger. - You're a good luck charm. - Yeah. Not for rabbits. You're really hot, you know that? - Uh... - You're the hottest girl - in our class. - No, I'm not. One of the hottest at least. I've been thinking about coming up here with you all day. Feel how excited I am. You like me, right? Put your hand on my dick. You're not afraid, are you? No. Lisa? Hey! Me and Tess are here. I was just, uh, changing the lightbulb. Oh, I haven't even showered yet. I'm just back from the plant. Can I get you something to drink, Tess? Uh... juice? Soft drink? No, thanks. Go ahead.

Yeah. So what are you, my fuckin' sister - or something? What? - No! Well? I moved in here with Gerry. He goes out with Lisa. Who's Gerry? Gerry O'Neal. My mother goes out with Gerry fuckin' O'Neal? - Yep. - What's he to you? He's my mom's boyf... well, like, was my mom's boyfriend. She's dead. Who's your mama? Shelly... Small. Shelly Small's dead, huh? Hey, you wanna sit? You wanna sit? 'Kay. They're out. I saw. Potluck. Where'd you come from? Lisa, I'm told. Where were you at last night? To get that... A cabin party. It was stupid though. - Why was it stupid? - I don't know. It was just stupid. No fun in the cabin? We had a dandy cabin in the backwoods there. Just made out of scrap, really. But we had lots of fun. Left the stove on one night, burnt it to the ground. Stood around and roasted hot dogs over it. Well... I suppose this place is a bit more crowded than I expected. Do you sleep in my room? You don't have a place to stay? No worries. - I'm OK. - You could stay out at my house if you want. There's no one there. - No, I... - Really! And it's a mess but... I mean, it's not fancy or anything but you could stay there. Ahem. Yeah, alright. Yeah. - Yeah? - I'll get the key. It's the green and white one that's across from the plant. Do you know it? Yeah, I do. Well, there you go. Ahem. Well, thank you. It's... nothin'. Well, I'll go. I'll just get on then. OK. Holy shit. What? Lisa's young fella showed up today. He said that you let him stay at your mother's house. Yeah. It was empty anyway, so. That's kind of fuckin' strange, don't you think? - What're you getting on with? - Well, he's been gone for nearly 20 years. Must be he wants - money or something. - Oh! I'm sure Lisa would love to hear you say that. You don't know anything about him. If he's here, he's lookin' for something. Maybe he just wants to see his mom. How long is he stayin'? - Hey, Ger? You home? - Yeah, I'm up here. - I'm sorry if I woke you up. - No. It's OK. I was pretty much awake. You wanna come in? I just gotta run up and get something if that's OK? - Yeah, it's your house. - Thanks. Stupid bear! You hungry? I gotta go to school. At least stay for a cup of tea? Yeah? You saw your mom? I did, yeah. It was strange. She... she's a lot smaller than she looms in my head, I tell you. She'll bring me to supper on Friday. So you're staying a while then? Yeah, for a week maybe. I... I mean, if that's all right. Yeah, yeah. Sure. It's a shitty couch to stay on, though. I don't mind. What's all the news around these parts these days? Uh... You, mostly. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Is that good news or bad? Ahem. I'm going for a walk. I'll look into the barns in a bit, if you wants to join me. Sure. What you looking for? I don't know. I was looking for shrooms. Used to get a lot of 'em up here years ago. We used to get ripped... ripped on 'em. Yeah, I... I found some - the other day. - You be careful with them. They're powerful little friggers. Who was that? I don't know. Well... in about 15 minutes, the whole harbour's gonna be talking about how Tess Small was up in the woods with Danny Sharpe. You should, uh, drop by again sometime. - That was fun, hey? - Yeah. I will. You can sleep in my room if you want. My mom's room, I... usually keep that closed. OK. Yeah. It's really good of you, what you been doing for Danny. Oh. It's no trouble. It just made sense. He said you've been really nice to him. Thanks. Did you have a nice visit? Yeah. It's something strange, seeing him like that, he's all grown up. He's a man. Got himself all straightened out. Told me he's coming for supper later in the week. He is! You'll be here for it. You know... With me and Gerry together, it's almost like you and Danny are brother and sister. Pass it here. I used to collect things from here when I was little. Like... beach rocks and feathers and shells and stuff. I'd bring them home and my mom was... she'd get so cracked. She said they were filthy. I was down here a lot when I was a young fella too. I spent a lot of time alone. I was there out by the river one time. I was about 12, I suppose. You know, where the sewage runs in there. All the toilet paper up on the rocks like little mummies. Used to remind me of mummies. I saw... I saw a little face in the river. I thought it was a fish or something at first, like half a rotted fish. It was bright red, raw. It was a baby. Or a... a fetus or whatever. Could've fit it in the palm of me hand. Tiny. Tiny little thing. Did someone have a miscarriage or something? Yeah. Or something. Yeah. Flushed it. Sick. What'd you do? - Ate it! - Ah! Pick one for me. What do you got here? Oh. I don't even have to go through them. Here. Got you one. Where do you want it? There. - You're so tough. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I gotta get a hot cloth. - I got it. I got it. - Gross. - Hmm! That's how you does it. - That's how all mine were done. - Mm! Hey, you know what I remembered today? Me and my buddies, we all had... Well, we all used to crush on your mama... ...when we were kids. - Really? - Yeah. She was beautiful. I guess she was a teenager then. She wore a ponytail on top of her head. I remember I thought it was the coolest thing. She was nice to me too. She was sweet. Let's see. Patience, now. - What is it? - You gotta count to six hundred. Hmm. I was hoping you'd pick this one. It suits you. It's your house. It won't be for me. - What are you doing here? - You're still alive? Check my pulse. - Cute tattoo. - Thanks. Danny just put it on. I thought you might want your homework. Oh. Sure. Yeah. You guys are in the beer, are you? What? I can't come in? Not right now. Just... give me my homework and... I'll come over tomorrow night and we'll hang out. So you wanna hang out with me now, do you? How'd you know I was here? Everyone knows you're here with him. Evan said he saw you up in the woods together. Good. I'm glad Evan saw us. You know what people are saying? You're hookin' up with Evan one day, then you're up - in the woods with him. - So you just came over here - to call me a slut. - No, I didn't! I came here to check on you because I was worried about you. - I can take care of myself. - What are you gonna do? Follow him around, be his little groupie? Everything all right? You causin' trouble for my girl? That's not gonna fly with me. Why don't you get a girlfriend your own age, you creep. Why don't you make yourself scarce, young one? We were supposed to go to town on the weekend to look at grad dresses, but I guess you don't care about that anymore. No, I don't care about that anymore. I don't give a fuck either. Come on. You all right? Yeah. Fuck her anyway. That's the spirit. Tired? I guess. Well, I'll probably go to bed now soon. OK. Maybe I should... go? 'Kay. I'll see you at Lisa's tomorrow night. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna take off then after that. I'm going back to town. I gotta get back to me bar and everything. Yeah, I don't blame you. One week in this place is enough to make anyone want to leave. There she is. Easy. Go easy now. What? Yeah... I'd... I'd say that I didn't see anything, but... Oh, she's not having any jokes. How are you feeling? Not much really. What can I get you? What do you need? Something to warm me up maybe? Drop of rum with ginger ale. - Thanks. - Don't tell Lisa. Shit! Oh, shit! What time is it? - We gotta go to supper! - That's done. That's done. We already arsed that up. Oh... - Fuck. - Don't worry about it. It's just a bit of supper. Lisa'd probably be more surprised if I did show up. We might as well spend the night here, eh? I'll bring you over in the morning. I'll come with you. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. When you left, how'd you do it? I made a mess of it, I suppose. Made an arsehole of myself... 'til by the time I left, there was nobody sad to see me leave. I wouldn't recommend that approach. I don't want you to leave. I've gotten pretty used to your company too. Come here. If you leave, I'll have nobody. Hmm. I hate them all. All the boys around here and their dirty fucking fingernails. I swear to God, if one more of them touches me, I'll slit their throat. Hey. That's a bit drastic. Why don't you just, uh... stick it out, finish school... ...hit the road. There's nobody holding you here. OK? I'm sorry we, uh... we missed supper. I had it all out. You could've called. What was so important you had to miss supper? Where the Jesus have you been, Tess? - It's my fault. - No doubt about that. I should've known that she was tangled up with the likes of you. What happened? What do you think happened? Look whose clothes - she's wearing! - I... brought the girl home. Danny, you said all this shit was behind us. Look, just get the Jesus off this deck before I throws you off. OK. You haven't changed one ounce! Not one ounce! I'm sorry they were such assholes. That's, uh... nothing to do with you, girl. You leaving now? Oh, yeah. I'll say. You gonna be all right? You look me up, you makes your way to the big city. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Come here. What the hell is wrong with you? You wouldn't even let him speak. - You don't know him. - Yeah, I do. I know him. I know him really well and he knows me too. No. Oh, you don't know him, Tess! - YES, I DO! - You don't know anything about him! Did you know that he broke his mother's nose once? - Did he tell you that one? - He was a kid when he did that! Like you are? I'm goin' home. You don't have to leave.

Since you won't call me back, I guess I have to leave it here. You've officially missed too many days to graduate. But please, come by and talk to me. There's summer school or you could do an extra year. We can figure this out. Anyway, get in touch. I wasn't expecting to see you so soon. That's all. I couldn't stay. What do you think? It's nice. Not bad. I'll dig out some blankets for you. You can go in. That's my room right there. I'm pretty good at decoratin'.

You find that funny? - What do you do? - Not much. - Go to university. - I'll assume that's on your tab as well, is it, dicky bird? Yeah, man. I'll get you on Sunday. Yeah. That's when his allowance comes through. So what are you doing in this dirty old bar - on a Tuesday? - I'm staying with Danny. Yeah. She's staying with Danny. - She's staying with Danny. - Is that - all right with you? - I suppose. People end up making these consistent errors in their judgment. Like, for instance, like this one called the prospector. Like, the guy is going to offer you a choice between a guaranteed $1000 or maybe a 50-50 chance of getting $0 if you took the bet. Most times, people don't take the guaranteed $1000 just because when it comes to a sure game, people are more risk-adverse. But in the case that, if it was like a... like a sure loss, then all of a sudden, - people become a little more... - Where's he going? Oh, who knows? You can't keep track of him. Not gonna get rid of me that easy. Hungry? That's disgusting. I thought you liked 'em. You trying to kill us or what? - I was gonna do that. - No. Where are you goin'? - I'm goin' to a party. - Already? Well, I mean, gotta go to the bar first, - but later, yeah. - Where's the party?

NO! - I'm not roping you in. - I don't know what you got goin' on in your head up there but it's not gonna happen. Why don't you believe me? Calm down. If you leave, I'm gonna kill myself. Yeah, I am. I'm gonna kill myself just like my mom did. OK. That's your solution? That's your answer to everything? Toss yourself into the harbour, is that how you're gonna do it? Tess, you need some help, girl. And it ain't me. Can't let you come crawlin' into my bed. I know it seems like a lot of people. But I swear, we're not just here to hang out. OK? Tess, I'm Dr. Summers. I'll be doing your procedure. - How you doing? You OK? - Mm-hmm. - OK. - Now, Tess? Just take this for me. This is nitrous oxide, laughing gas. Now, all right, nice and tight. OK. Deep breaths. It's gonna make you feel like you're swimming. That's good, Tess. Just give us a few of those deep, deep breaths. Thank you. - Good girl. - Now, relax for me. Knees apart. Thank you. - How are you feeling? - Mm-hmm. - OK? - Bit of pressure, Tess. There's gonna be a bit of a pinch now. OK? There you go. All right. Yup. Thank you. I slept like a friggin' pretzel last night. I woke up this morning and my arm was all in knots. I swear, I had to do yoga - just to get out of bed. - Oh, that must be nice. I never slept at all. Jaden went and wet the bed again. - Oh, God. - Oh, yeah. And then crawled in - with me. - Just be glad. I mean, mine won't even give me a hug anymore.
