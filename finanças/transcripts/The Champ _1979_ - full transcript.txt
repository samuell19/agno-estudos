Nothing about Charlie Goodman. You listen to this kid, man? What, you're gonna fight again? I didn't say nothin'. Did I say somethin'? Hey, come here. What are you getting me in trouble for? Good luck, Billy. Good luck nothin'. Why'd you say that to him? Billy, slow down. If you feel like going in the ring again, maybe you should, but be careful. You're 37. Last time you fought, you were 30. Jersey Joe walcott... Took the heavyweight championship of the world when he was 37 years old. Archie Moore was how old? He was 50. Who knows? I know that, too. All I'm saying is that neither of those guys laid off for 7 years. Hey, Jimmy. Hey. 1,200 bucks I made off you in the Johnny ward fight. Yeah. Double up on the hooks. Caught him in the 8th. Oh, you were beautiful, Billy. I remember watching your fights and saying to myself, "my god, this kid has got such talent." I figured you'd hold the title for 5 more years. But you had one bad fight, you lose it, and you walk away. I gotta go, Mr. Riley. Good luck, Billy. Come on! Let's go! What's this? What's the hold up here? Let's go, let's go! Come on, come on.

I saved this for you for 7 years. Your gloves. The gloves of a champion. Your locker, Billy. I saved all your stuff, Billy. Got the trunks, the cup, the headgear. It's all here. I said, "someday "Billy's gonna walk through that door, and he's gonna ask for it." Has Goodman showed up yet? No, not yet. But he'll be here. You think this is right, Georgie? That I should show him what I got? That I should step in that ring and show him what I got? I made a lot of money for that man. Champion of the world. It ain't right. I'm taking a walk. Billy! What are we going to tell him? You tell him exactly what I said! Hey, what's the matter? And if he wants to wait for me, that's fine. He can wait for me! I'll be back in half an hour.

It was Charlie Goodman's idea. Really. Just a couple of beers. And you know, everyone started to buy him drinks. He didn't wanna hurt everybody's feelings. Right. Thanks a lot, Josie. See ya. Oh, boy. Ohh. Boy, it's hot in here. Ahh. Thanks, t.J. You're a good boy. You're a good boy. You know why I lost the title? I lost my title, t.J. Why, champ? 'Cause i--i didn't care. I just--the hell with it. I didn't care anymore. You hear that, t.J.? I didn't care. Let's get undressed, champ. Let me take off your pants. Here. Let me do that. Whoop. Let me do it. The day a man can't take off his own pants then he ain't a man. Why don't you go brush your teeth, huh? Sure, champ. Can you help me with this? Yeah, I'll help you with this. Yeah. Look. Easy as pie.

Yes, but I've been going crazy. Of course you're going crazy. Know why you're going crazy? Because... It's hereditary. It's in your blood. You got a crazy father. Ohh. I'll tell you, you know where I was all last night? Where? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I couldn't sleep last night. Know why? Why? 'Cause I let my son down yesterday, spent all the money on liquor. What else is new? Horrible. And on top of everything else, worst of all... I stole $20 from my own son. Oh! Aw! It's ok, champ. My money is your money. Right on, t.J. No, it's not ok. What a terrible thing to do. And you know what I did with the money? What do you think? Go gambling. That's right. I went gambling. You know your father too well. So I go back to the crap table. Of course I go back to the crap table. And I lay the money down on the crap table, and your old man is shooting the craps, see? And what do you think happens there? I make 7 straight passes, lettin' it ride every time. 7 straight passes. Your old man was winning last night. Now how much do you think he won? 100? More than that. How much? 200?

Hey, Billy, what'd you get for t.J.? What'd I get for t.J.? Ohh. Ohh. What? Ohh. How could I forgot my own son? Billy. Ohh. Ohh. Oh, no. Poor t.J. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Maybe there was a little something. I gotta think now. Yeah, yeah. Well, let me see if I can find it. Mr. Riley! Mr. Riley! Would you bring that little thing I got for t.J.? Bring it right over here, please? I can't see it. Oh! It's a horse. Oh, yes. She's beautiful. Well, what's the matter? Don't you like it? I could take it back. She's mine? Yeah. All mine? Yeah, yeah.

Dolly kenyon, owner of the brilliant 3-year-old champion just a sec. Don't forget this race. I got a horse in this race, too. Of course, Dolly's chance. Yeah, that little bay over there. She didn't cost much, but she's a good animal. Anybody can do what my husband does. He pays hundreds of thousand of dollars for just a sec. I paid $5,000, and she's gonna win this race. Bullshit. Who said that? Who said what? Bullshit. Somebody said bullshit. Mrs. Kenyon, what about just a sec? Just a horse, just a horse. Thank you very much and good luck. Did you say that, little boy? You weren't supposed to hear. Well, I heard. See, boy... What are you doing here anyway? What do you mean, what am I doing here? I'm a horse owner like you, and mine's gonna win. What's your name? And speak up. T.j. I said your name, not your initials. Look, I gotta talk to my rider. I can't waste my time with you. Jeffie! Yeah? Where've you been. I've got to talk to you. Little smart aleck. Thank you very much. Jeffie, don't raid her, don't raid her. You told me already. Don't let her get boxed in. Go to the front and improve your position. Sure, sure. Relax, t.J. I'll ride the horse. You watch. Everything's cool, ok? That's some horse. Is she really yours? Yeah. Mine and my dad's. She's got an extremely attractive head. Good combination. What's her name? She's a lady. Whoever named her knew what he was talking about. She has good composure. Are you with that... Um, "sassy boy," lady? She's a personal friend of mine. Personal friend or not, don't bet on that horse. Bet on mine. You'll make a million. Believe me. Well, I need a million. You got it. It's in the bank. Ok. I'll, um... I'll bet her. But if she doesn't pay off, I'll come looking for you. Ok.

Was that a kid or a jockey? He owns the horse. What? Did you see what he did to Dolly? I think Dolly was flirting with him. How about you? I guess I was. Hello. I promised to bet his horse. Uh-oh. Will you do me a favor and put $10 on her? It's number one. She's a lady. Mmm. Oh, but I don't think you should say anything to Dolly about it. No. Ladies and gentlemen, 10 minutes to post time. Post time in 10 minutes. Got any horse owners in this line? Yes, I'm a horse owner. You're a horse owner? You're in the wrong line, horse owner. I asked about this line. I'm just kidding. I know a horse owner who's 8 years old. That's right. No. I'm telling you the truth. My son owns a horse. He's 8 years old. I got some money together. I got him a nice horse. Horses are nice for kids to be around. Anyway, I get him the horse, and he's going to sleep that night. He's actually falling asleep that night, and he says to me, he says, "champ--" he calls me champ 'cause I used to be a boxer. He says, "you would do this for me?" He said, "I can't believe it. You are a good father." He fell asleep. Yes, 10--i don't want the odds to go down. 10 on number one to win. She's a lady. Nice talking to you folks. Ladies and gentlemen, the horses are coming onto the track... The owner of the horse, please, ladies. There. Sit up, boy. Watch out. No, he's a genuine owner. Youngest owner in the history of hialeah. Move back. Yeah, lady, I'm gonna move back. As soon as the race starts, I'm gonna go right back there. Excuse me. And is the oldest in continuous use.

He's relaxed, the horse is nice. He's in good shape, see? Yeah. The flag is up. Let's be ready. All right, let's go! All right, that's it, Jeff! Hold him right there. Don't give him his head. Hold him back! Perdition around the turn, Dolly's chance head-to-head with Sunday's child. She's a lady, she's a lady. Come on. She's a lady. Man stomper is the sixth horse. And t.T.'S baby, small virtue. Yeah, come on! Hold it right there, Jeff! Don't let her make the move yet! But she's a lady is burning up that track. She's a lady is flying. She's a lady. Come on! Stop that, Annie. Who are you rooting for, anyway? But, Dolly, look at her. Man stomper making a run now at she's a lady. Man stomper trying to get up there. She's a lady, man stomper... Ohh! She's a lady. And now, running for home... Look at him! Look at him! Look at him! Look! She's in second. Sunday's child trying to hold onto third. And she's a lady falls down. Aah! Dad! Oh, oh, damn it. It's the boy's horse. That's Billy. That... That's Billy down there with that boy. Is t.J... Him? The horse was going to win that race. I'll keep her no matter what-- even if she can't run no more. I'll--I'll-- I'll brush her, and--and I'll feed her every day. Yeah. Yeah. What are you doing here? How's the horse? Is the horse all right? The horse is just fine. In 5 minutes, they'll probably shoot. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! It doesn't work anymore, Billy. What do you mean, it doesn't work anymore? It doesn't work any-- just like old times, huh? What are you doing here now? No smoking in the barn area. What do you want? T.j. Is Timmy, isn't he? Yeah, t.J. Is Timmy. So you figured it out. So what? Even a dumb horse knows her own foal. Don't you think one of us ought to be with him now? If he's out there-- one of us-- one of us-- yeah, one of us is. One of us was. Billy! You dropped your purse. Billy, will you stop it, please? What do you want to do, hold his hand? You know what I told him? I told him you had died, that you were killed in a car wreck, that you were a tramp, that we were better off without you. You're dead, you understand that? You're dead. The kid's got no mother. I am his mother. You're dead. He's got no mother. I'm here. I am his mother. You gave me custody, didn't you? And you got what you wanted. Now get the hell out of here. Billy. Billy, please. I'd just like to see him. I'd like to know what he's like. You want to know what he's like? Take a look. He's the one-in-a-million kid you dream about. That's what he's like. You ain't going to see him-- not now, not never. Come on, let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. Billy, stop it! You want me to get a lawyer? You want to do that? No. No, I don't want to do that, but you know as well as I do that no court in the country would deny me the right to see him. Superficial wound, nothing more. He's going to be all right? Ok. Champ. Champ! Where's the champ? Champ! Champ! Champ, where are you? He's ok. He's ok! That's wonderful. Champ... The doctor said it's a superficial wound. Get that? Superficial wound. Yeah. Come on, let's go. He's going to be ok. Oh, t.J., I'm glad. I saw it from the stands. I was worried. Come on. T.j.? Uh, we have this other matter to discuss. I bet on her. You owe me a flat 10 bucks. The name's Annie. Yeah, well, it's nice to meet you, Annie. Maybe I'll take you up on that invitation sometime. Are you happy, champ? Yeah, yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. Come on. Why do we have to go? Because it's fun. You know, people... People inviting other people over. Why do we have to be dressed up? Because... Because these people are rich people. You want to look nice, don't you? You look nice. You look real nice. Why did she ask me about the $10? Hey, what is this, question day? I told you about that. She didn't mean nothing by that. It's just... Her little sense of humor. Some sense of humor. Ok, come on, let's go. I forgot. I got to make a phone call. Hey, look... Here. I want you to go up there, see? Let's see. Let's see if your hair's nice. Good. Ok, that's it. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'll see you in 20 minutes. Go ahead. See you in 20 minutes. Hey, hold it. Wait just a second. That'd be beautiful, walking in with 37.50 on your sleeve, huh? All right, go ahead. Go ahead. Come on. Have a good time. Be back. Yeah. I'll be back in 20 minutes. Mrs. Phillips is waiting for you down there. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi, t.J. Hi, Annie. Where'd your father go? He had to make a telephone call. He'll be right back in 20 minutes. Ok. How's the filly? Oh, she's ok. She's getting better and better every day. Is she really? Yep. When do you start working her out? We'll be working her out in a couple weeks. In 2 weeks? Uh-huh. That's amazing, t.J. That's wonderful. We're going to start entering a couple of races, and then we're going to start collecting the dough. Mrs. Phillips, you have a phone call. Will you take a message? I'll call them back later. He said it was an emergency. All right, Bob. You know what an emergency is, t.J.? It's anything that they can't handle. Mike... Uh... Mike--t.j., I'd like you to meet my husband. This is Mike. Mike, this is t.J. Hello, t.J. Hi. Do you think you two can keep each other company for just a few minutes? There's a phone call. Ok. Sit down. So... Your filly's going to be all right, huh? She's going to be fine. The vet said she didn't even swell up. Good. Excuse me. Um... Can I talk to you honest? Sure. Annie--Annie don't understand. When you lose a bet, you lose a bet. You mean... She wants the money back? Exactly. Do you want me to talk to her? Hmm? Don't you think you should talk to her? I guess so. Who's he? Oh, his name was Thomas parr, and he was an english farmer. He was very famous because he lived to be 153-- the oldest man who ever lived. No kidding. And he might've lived who knows how long, only they took him to London to show him to the king. What happened in London? He ate and drank himself to death. How could he live to be 153? That's what I try to figure out-- why people get old and why some people like Thomas parr live so long and other people don't. Uh... Are--are you... A doctor? Mmm, sort of. A gerontologist. How are you two getting along? Oh, we've been having a great talk. What are you talking about? Old man parr. T.j., that--that was your father on the phone. A friend of his is in some kind of trouble, and he won't be able to be back until 6:30. Well, it's not that bad here, you know. Do you want to see around the boat? Come on, I'll show you around. All right? Did he say which friend was in trouble? He didn't, but he said it wasn't important, and that he'd be back in a few hours. Now, don't worry about it. Do you like boats? Oh, yeah. Well, t.J., look at that one. Oh, wow, that's pretty. Isn't it? Look how many people there are. Wow. Look at that one. That's pretty, too. Ah, I tell you, wow. I wish that Jack could see that one. He'd love it. Hey... You're pretty damn good. You a hustler? Naw, I'm just lucky. Oh. Well, try her again, then. Naw. What do I get? Anything you say. Anything I say? All right, anything I say. Right here. How about this one right here? There you are. Are you sure you don't want to try that again? Once more? Yeah, I'm sure. I tried. You're a sweetheart, too. I caught you. Oh! Oh! I'm going to attack you! Now, you keep that blanket on. Don't worry, I will. Remember where the saddle is from. That's from england. Don't lose the halter. It's expensive. Don't worry, I won't. Now, you take care of your filly, you promise? I promise. Who's your vet? Doc. What the hell kind of name is doc for a vet? Listen, if something goes wrong, you call me, understand? I got the best vet in the world. Sure. Don't worry, Dolly, I will. Bye, love. Bye. Bye, t.J. Bye. Annie. Thanks for going swimming with me. The champ won't let me go alone. And... When you go away, I'll always remember this day. Bye, t.J. Here. Bye, Annie. Bye. Any time you want, come to the backstretch, and then--and then I'll show you around. You could see my horse. Bye. The champ must be waiting for me. Bye. Bye, Annie. Champ! Ah, t.J., I must've conked out. Did you get a lot of presents? Yeah. Look-- look at this saddle. Look at it. Look at it. Saddle. It must've cost 200 bucks. Look at that. Feel it. That's real leather. I'm looking. It's-- yeah, well, they spoil you silly in there. I can see that. They were real nice people, not like most turf clubbers. They didn't have their nose in the air. Oh, I'm glad of that. Look at this halter. Look at that halter. Look at this. It even says "she's a lady." Oh, yeah. Look at that. Yeah. I'd rather have a rope halter. You don't have to clean it so much. Yeah, this is nice. It's nice. Annie was very nice. Guess what her husband is? What's that? A geritologist. Oh... A geri-what? Uh, a doctor. The old lady was rich, but nice. Close the door, will you? Oh, they have a beautiful boat, and--and then I went swimming with Annie. We had such fun. I wish you could've been there with us. What happened, champ? Where were you? Come on, Billy. One more time. Another roll. 7. One more. Come on, baby. Hey, what do you need when you walk down Broadway? What? A .44. Come on. 44! 44! And now I'm going to take a leak. Bobby's going to roll for me. Watch my chips, will you? Come on, come on. Hey, Billy. Hey, Roy, your friend's in there cleaning up. What's up, Billy? Me? There you go. Just ask for Billy. Get me a beer, will you, Phil? That beer's good. Ok, Billy, coming right up. Right there. Ok? Billy Flynn? Yeah, who wants to know? You a cop? No. I'm Mike Phillips. You look like a cop, you know that, Mike? You got just a minute? I'd like to talk to you. Not now, Mikey. I'm a-winning. I'm Annie's husband. Just a minute? Yeah, yeah, all right. Uh... Let's find someplace. We have a little problem. No, we don't have a problem. I got rid of that problem several years ago. You got the problem. I really want to talk about the boy. What did she do, cry a little bit for you to come down here? You know, you can be in a lot of trouble messing around in other people's business. I'm married to the mother of your son. You don't like that, but that's the way it is. I'll tell you the way it is. T.j. Is a healthy, happy kid, and he's going to stay that way. The track is the greatest place in the world for a kid to grow up. Oh, I agree with you. Oh, you agree with me? Beautiful place for a kid to grow up. It's a kind of a paradise. When I saw t.J., I thought, "my god, what a wonderful child." My hats off to you, Billy. You've been a great father. Well... Anyway, he knows his manners. I got to go. I'm on a hot streak. Wait. Wait. There's more to it, isn't there? I mean... He does have a mother. He's got no mother. You going to decide for him? It's up to him to make up his own mind. I got to go. Let me just ask you this-- t.j. Won't always be 8-years-old. He's a very bright little boy. What happens when he finds out that he has a mother, and that she loves him, and that she wanted to be with him sometimes, only you wouldn't let that happen? How are you going to handle that? Some goddamn mother. She never does nothing for him, and now after 7 years, it's, "oh, my, oh, my, I just love him so much. I just never knew it." Never did she change his pants or wipe his nose, teach him his prayers, tell him right from wrong, give him a bath. But what difference does that make? Some goddamn mother. Good night, gents. Good night. Good night. Good night. A horse? What am I going to do with a goddamn horse? That horse cost me 6,000. I don't care what it cost. Tell you what-- you bring me... $2,000... Within 48 hours... Or I'll take the goddamn horse. All right? I bought that horse for my kid. It's going to break his heart. Billy, I don't want to break a kid's heart. I got a kid of my own. Ok. I'll get you the money. Right. I'll get you the money somehow. Right. Hello, Harold. Billy. Billy Flynn. Yeah, listen, about the thousand dollars... About the thousand dollars you owe me. Harold, don't talk to me like that. Come on. Couldn't you work out something? I mean, there must be something you could work out. Yeah? Who do you think you're talking to? Harold, I see you at the track. You're no stranger out here. I see you with the ladies. You spend a lot of money. You got a lot of weight in your pockets, kid. Look, I wouldn't call you if I didn't-- if this wasn't important, I wouldn't call you. All right, you little-- look, you little weasel, i--i carried you-- i--i! The designers of the thirties rediscovered the beauty of the shape of a woman. They returned to languor, to sensuality. They gave women a sense of their bodies, and draped them in satin, silk, fur and filigree, clinging velvet, quantities of costume jewelry, sequins, veils, and... Feathers. Uh, vionnet... Vionnet was the first designer to, uh, completely master the art of the bias-cut dress. She created clothes that clung to the body... And yet moved freely. There is one designer in the history of fashion who stands alone, whose instincts for the needs of the contemporary woman pulled fashion irrevocably into the 20th century and showed the world that comfortable could be glamorous. The Chanel revolution gave women a total look for day and evening. And always with her perfect sense of balance and proportion, which we see in this classic dinner suit. Piccard, vionnet, lanvin, Chanel-- they were the dressmakers of Paris. They were also artists. Historians, photographers, and museums are teaching us that fashion, like painting and sculpture, is an art. Fashion. What people choose to wear has and always will reflect a time and express a way of living. You were marvelous. Hello, Nikki. I'll be back. Billy? Billy, wait. It was stupid my coming here. I don't know why I did it. Uh, it was... Crazy. Timmy's all right, isn't he? T.j.'s fine. I need a favor. You know, all those guys-- remember when I was on top, I was a certain kind of guy. Now people forget me. You don't wanna hear this. What am I talkin' about? Billy. Billy, uh... Why don't you tell me and let me decide? $2,000. I need $2,000. Ok. It's no big deal. I want you to understand that. It don't make no difference to me if you give me the money or not. I still feel the same way about what you did. I don't know when I can pay you back. It doesn't matter. I'm glad you're doing this. What are you talkin' about? The money-- for t.J. Oh, you know about that, huh? Yeah... I lost t.J.'S horse gambling. Some things don't change. I gotta go. Hey, you know what? You look pretty good up there. I couldn't figure out what the hell you were talking about, between you and me, but I... You got it across pretty good. Billy. Uh... You're a big shot now. Billy. Billy... You know what? There aren't any big shots. You know, you always did have a head on your shoulders. That's one of the things I liked about you-- that you had a head on your shoulders. Ah...ohh... Until I wanted to use it. Well, times change. People change. Ever hear of that? In those days, I wanted a woman... To be around when I needed her-- in a house waiting for me when I come home. Today...well, today... I feel absolutely the same way. Ha ha. You're something. You're really something. Yeah, I am. Well, I was only kidding. But not much. No, not much. Hey, excuse me. Barn 11? Yes, sir, it is. Is Billy around? You mean the champ? He's over there working. Billy! How ya doin'? What's the matter, you don't trust me? I told you I'd bring the money this afternoon. What's this for? What is this for? Yeah. What's that for? For carrying a horse, that's what that's for. You think I drag around a horse trailer for the hell of it? That's very funny. What horse? Come on, Billy. You know what horse. You were happy last night when I told you I had the money. Changed my mind. I sorta like the idea of owning a race horse. Billy, Billy--hey! Come on now. We had a deal, didn't we? 48 hours. Deadline was up 10 hours ago, right? It's only a horse, bubbie. Huh? Ooh. Billy! No! No! Champ. I've, uh... Talked to most of the witnesses, gotten affidavits from several of them. They all seem to tell the same story, so there's, uh... Not much question about what happened. The, uh, judge who's going to be handling this hearing is a friend of mine. So the only real problem we have, I think, is the broken jaw suffered by one of the security guards. Poor guy. He's just trying to do his job, and I brain him like a goddamn... Animal. Outside of the immediate task of getting you out of jail, Mrs. Phillips is very worried about her son. She asked me to tell you that she would like to take care of him until this is settled. Champ? I... Know how hard this must be for you. You don't know nothin'. Huh. How--how you doing... Champ? Sit down. I... I thought you might be hungry. I brought you something to eat. I brought you some ribs. I ain't hungry. Ok, champ. I don't want you to call me champ no more. Why? A champ don't use his fist nowhere but in the ring. But he was trying to take our horse, champ. I know, I know, but it don't make no difference, t.J. I had no right, see? I'm a bum. No, you're not. D-did they say when you could get out? Did they say when you could come home? They don't know yet, t.J. Could be a month. Could be 6 months. Look, there's something we gotta talk about. You know that lady... The one at the boat? The one you're going on about how nice she is all the time? Annie? Yeah, that's the one. Annie. Well, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to live with her. Why--why can't I stay in the backstretch with Josie? Because I said so, that's why. I'm your father, and that's the end of that. W-why do you want me to do that? Because... Because you're a pain in the ass, that's why. Because I can't do nothin' without... Without you naggin' at me all the time. "Champ" this and "champ" that. I go to have a drink, you say, "no, champ, don't." I go to play cards, you say, "no, don't do that." You tug at my belt. I'm sick of you tuggin' at me. I'm sick of feedin' you. I'm sick of takin' care of you. I'm sick of your hangin' around. Ooh! You're a pain in the ass! Please, champ... I'll... I'll do whatever you say. I--i won't eat that much. I won't-- I'll let you play cards as much as you want, I promise! No, no, no. You're going. That's it. Please, champ. I'll... All I want is to be with you. Please, champ. I'll be somebody when I grow up. Somebody like you. Don't talk like that. Look, you're going. That's it. I want you to go. I'll do whatever you say as long as I'm with you. I don't wanna talk no more. I want you to go. I want you to go in the boat. No, you don't. You don't want me to go. You understand now? I want you to go. No, you're a liar! Ok, champ. Ok, go ahead. Take him to that boat. Dolly, I have to talk to you. What's up? Timmy. He's here. He's here? Yes, he's here. A lot sooner than I expected him to be. Well, good. Go to him. But the party, dol. I... Oh, that doesn't matter. Will you stop it? The kid must be starved. Give him something to eat. All right. I'll try to get there later. Ok. I brought you some food. You must be hungry. No. I'm not. Honest. Have you eaten today? No. Well, let me make you a sandwich. T.j., have you ever been... To New York? No. It's a really big city. We could, uh... Could fly there tomorrow-- just for a week. Before you know it, Billy will be out, and... You'll be back here with him. Thank you, Annie. Here. You'll eat it later. How about a glass of milk? Ok. You know, you must be tired. It's time you went to bed. Come on. I'll help you undress. No, it's ok. The day a man can't take off his own pants, he--he ain't a man. Who told you that? The champ? Well, before you take your pants off, you have to take your shoes off. Come. Sit here. Here let me... Hup. I--i can do it. I--i don't know why these shoes keep on gettin' knots in them. L-let your mother do-- Champ didn't tell you? Tell... Tell me what? I'm your mother. No. M-my mother's dead. No, she's not. She's a-- she's a beautiful angel. No, she's not. I am here, and I love you. I love you very much. You don't live with us. Y-you're not married to champ. No, listen. Listen to me, t.J. You don't have to live with someone to love them. I love you. Do you love the champ? Do you? Do you love him? No. You're not my mother. No... You're not my mother. Ple--please! No, please. Listen to me. It's not that simple. T.j., listen to me. Go away. Please don't touch me. I don't want you. I don't want you! Timmy! Go away. Go away. Go away, I told you! Go away! Go away! I want champ! I don't want you. I want the champ. I want champ! Champ! I want champ! I don't want you! I wanna go back to the champ! I want champ! Get out of here! You know what you are? A pain in the ass. A pain in the ass. Yeah, that's right. Ah, I know one thing. I ain't gonna never leave you again. Oh, I love you so much. I love you so much. Yeah. Yeah? I didn't wake you, did I, Billy? There's a lady downstairs that wants to see you. Oh, thanks. Thanks, Willie. Didn't Josie tell you? He's here. He's ok. She told me. You're so lucky, Billy. God, how he loves you. Yeah. So... I, uh... I--i wanted to, uh... Talk to you. Well... Here I am. T.j... Found out last night that he has a mother. He--he's gonna need an explan-- an explanation. I'll take care of that. Billy... Will you tell him... How it was... And how it is? How is it? I'm not an angel in heaven. Who says? I'm not. I'm real. I'm here. A woman who suffers... Who wants her child to accept her as a mother who... Made a mistake. Made a hell of a mistake. All right. All right, but he has to understand why. Has to understand that 2 people just couldn't live together-- hey, hold your horses. 2 people? One person couldn't. I could. Oh, what? Billy... There are a million broken marriages. It's never because of one person! The reason why you have a broken marriage-- don't you remem-- one person doesn't care. That's your broken marriage. Don't tell me I didn't care. Then why did you leave? Come on! Tell me. Why? Look, let's not talk about what happened. Well, what did happen? I wanna know what happened. What'd you do, go to Paris and make dresses for French girls? What do I tell him? That you wanted a career, and that's why you left your son and your husband? Is that what you want me to say? Come on! Talk to me! I'm right here. I'll say anything you want. Come on. Talk to me! Billy, can't we just sit down quietly and discuss our son now? Just forget about him. Forget about him. He's a very strong boy. He can take care of himself. I can't forget about him. I know he's strong, but he's 8 years old. Yeah. 8 years of my life. But what's happening to him now? What's going on in him? What's he thinking? What's happening in his heart, his mind? What about my heart? What about my mind? What about me? What about me? Billy Flynn! Me, you know? What about me? I'm real, too. What's the matter, Billy? What is it? You can always come back. We'll--we'll take you back. You--we'll give you a second chance. Billy... I can't. I have a husband, Billy. Billy... You know, there are... There are different ways of loving someone. Can't we find our way? For t.J.? For our son? Come on, come on. Don't do that. I know what I gotta do. I know what to do. Don't worry about it. I know what to do. Ok, nothin' stands in my way. Who do we got? All the way to the champ. Andy pittman. Andy pittman? You a boxer? Ok, come on, Andy. Come on. Think fast. Come on. Whoa! Watch the right. Ok. Hold up. Andy's down, Andy's down. What do we do next? Um... Who do we got? Roland bowers. Roland bowers. Stay away from the right hand. But give him a little jab, see? Then go across the top. Inside. Inside. Bang, bang, bang! Roland is down. He's down. Bye-bye, Roland. Bye-bye, Roland is right. Ok. Now we're on our way. Championship of the world in 6 months! The championship of the world in just 6 months! That's right. Gonna buy a house. Buy a house with a swimming pool in it right in the middle of the house. Then we're gonna go traveling. Me and my kid, right? All over the world. Where we gonna go? Brazil! Brazil! What are we gonna see in Brazil? I know what we're gonna see. A lot of seã‘oritas dancing the cha-cha-cha. Right? Right. * cha cha cha * * cha cha cha * come on. Let's see what you're made of, kid. Let's see what you're made of, kid. Whoa! Oh, he hit me hard. Don't let him do that to you. Bing! Bing! You think I'm hurt, but I'm not hurt. I'm coming back, see? Bing! Bing! Oh. Watch it. They'll throw you out. You know, the rules are against you. Watch out. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's see-- oh! Good shot. Come on. Get back on your horse. We got a lot of work. Lot of work. Get your old man in shape. 37-year-old legs. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Get 'em, champ. Gotta breathe. Gotta breathe. All right. Come on. Sure, I'm hurt. What the hell does that matter? You're gonna fight again, and you don't call me? I was gonna call you, but I didn't want to waste your time. Bullshit. The fight ain't set yet. Bullshit. Jackie... You don't call me because you know Jackie's gonna give you a problem. What are you talking about? Look, Billy, this is Jackie sitting here. What, you think I don't know? You took too many goddamn punches in the last fight! Hey. Punches don't bother me. Yeah, well, they bother me. What about the headaches? You still get 'em? Headaches? Everybody gets headaches, Jackie. You get headaches, don't you? Take a few aspirin. That's it. You know. Huh? Come on, now, Billy. Look, I not talkin' about a split lip or a busted nose. I'm talkin' about something that could be serious. Let's, uh... Let's let the medical examiner decide, huh? I'm taking this fight, Jackie, for me and my boy, and nothing's gonna stop me. With or without you, I've made up my mind. Look... I gotta do something for my boy. A home. A good school, you know? I can't make that kind of money walkin' horses. I need you, Jackie. I need you with me. Ok. Beautiful, beautiful! Ha ha ha! I love you, Jackie! Hey, t.J. Yeah, champ? You got anything you wanna tell me? No, champ. Why do you keep secrets from me, t.J.? I haven't been keeping secrets from you. Oh, yeah. What about Annie's letters? What about that, huh? Uh, I'm sorry, champ. Uh, are you mad? No, I ain't mad. I just like to know what's under my bed, that's all. Huh. I ain't mad. She can write ya if she wants to. Come on. Let's go. T.j. T.j., come here. Come here. Come here, come here. Look at that, will ya? They got the right idea. Come on, let's go for a swim. Come on. Come on. Last one in is a rotten egg. Did you write her back? Not yet. Well... There's nothin' wrong with that, either, you know? Writin' to your mother. I--I'll write her tonight. Good. Last one in is a rot-- get your pants on! We're gonna be arrested for nude bathing. To hell with you. I'm going. Wait for me! Come on. Come on now. You're gonna be a rotten egg. Come on. Come on. Come on, son. All right. Whoo! Right this way. What, are you afraid of a little water? Aah! There you go. Oh, look at this one coming. Aah! Oh! Hey, hey! Hey! Champ. Yeah? Did you love her? Who? Annie. 'Course I loved her! Why do you think we had you, huh? Aah! Hold on. Here we go. Here we go. Hey. ...cab driver took a wrong turn. Like a fool, I gave him a dollar tip, and he acted as if I had stiffed him. Mmm. Are you with me or what? Oh. Yes, I'm--I'm with you. I... I--i received my first letter from my son today. From t.J. Great. Do you know how he signed it? "Your friend forever, Timothy Joseph Flynn." Ha ha. How is he? Oh, t.J.'S fine. He seems fine. It's, uh, it's Billy. What about him? Billy's making a comeback. Every fighter dreams of a comeback, huh? Yes, but... Take me out of the picture, and what have you got? Walking horses. No, I don't think that Billy would go back into the ring... If I hadn't come back into their lives. You sure you're not overreacting just a bit? Maybe. Mike... I'm worried. I'm worried about Billy. At any rate, I'm going to the fight. When is it? This Thursday in Miami. Mike, you do understand, don't you? Well, to be totally honest, I'm not sure I do. I mean, I'm delighted that t.J. Is back in your life, but the rest, all this, I'm not sure I like it at all. Well, maybe I can explain it to you. T.j. Didn't exactly say so in the letter, but I think... I think he'd like me to be there, and... Mike, what's more important is that I think I should be there. Would you prefer I lied to you? Will you call me if you decide to stay and walk horses? How's it feel, Billy? Feels good. How's that? Good. Ok, you guys. 3 more rounds. Let's get ready. Hey. Close the door, huh? Come on, champ. Punch him! Atta way. That's the way. You're lookin' good. You're lookin' beautiful. Let him chase you around. Just keep your left hand right in his face all the time. You're lookin' beautiful. Beautiful. Now just hang in there. You could do a lot more. Just don't do it. Don't do it. Champ, she's here. Who? Annie's here, champ. Look at her. Over there. Come on, Billy. Time to fight. What the hell are you doing? Come on! Don't she look beautiful? He'll run out of gas. Hit him with a good left, then right. Supposed to be an old man. Forget about it. You got 13 years on this kid. This is my night, Jackie. I can't do nothing wrong. I can't do nothing wrong. All right! Come on, Billy! Come on! Get up! Get up! Get up! Stay down! You're an old man! You're an old man! Come here, old man! Like I keep telling you all the time, you're taking a lot of punches for nothin'. This kid's legs are starting to go. All I want you to do is stick and move. I knocked him down. You see that? Yeah. Of course. Then he got right up. He's very strong. You paying attention to what I'm saying to you? I got it, for Christ's sake. I know youse is tough, but he's a good banger. He's got no legs left. Just keep movin', movin', movin'. I feel great. I feel great, kid. Billy, he's still strong. Stay away from that hand. Stay on your toes. Stay off the ropes. Go back. He'll be playin' our fight. We got it. You'll win, I'm tellin' ya. Break. Break. Get back. Ok. Hit back! Stick him, stick him, stick him! Come on, champ! Come on! Ah. It's only your head. Now will you listen to me?
