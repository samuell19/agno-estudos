GRAHAM BRINGS THE MESSAGE TODAY, HERE'S GEORGE BEVERLY SHEA TO SING FOR YOU. ♪ AMAZING GRACE ♪ ♪ HOW SWEET THE SOUND... ♪♪ [STATIC] DANG IT! OH, LORD. IF YOU CAN'T KEEP UP, WAIT HERE. HEY, JONATHAN.

YOU'VE HAD YOUR LOOK. WE'RE MOVING OUT OF YOUR TERRITORY. COME ON, NOW! COME ON. THANK YOU, LORD. YOU COULD'VE SHOT HIM, COULDN'T YOU? I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY WOULD'VE MADE MUCH DIFFERENCE, SON. YOU DID REAL GOOD BACK THERE. REAL GOOD. YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD RUN OR SCREAMED, IT MIGHT HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY. NOW, LET'S GET. THE BOY IN THE PICTURE BOOK, HE USED TO LIVE HERE? YEARS AGO. THE LADY, DID SHE DIE? LONG TIME NOW. DID YOUR BOY DIE, TOO? NO. DOES HE COME UP HERE AND SEE YOU MUCH? I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN YEARS. WE TOOK SEPARATE WAYS. HE'S GOT HIS OWN WORLD. HE NEVER FOUND MUCH USE FOR ALL THIS. MY MOM AND DAD ARE GETTING A DIVORCE. THAT'S WHY HE TOOK ME ON THIS TRIP. IT'S SUPPOSE TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT, BUT I DON'T CARE. LAURIE MATTHEWS? NEXT OFFICE. HI. CAN I HELP YOU? I BET YOU WANT PERSONNEL. IT'S LEFT OFF THE ELEVATOR. WE'RE AT THE RIGHT. IT HAPPENS A LOT. LAURIE MATTHEWS? YES. I WAS THINKING OF APPLYING FOR YOUR JOB. I'M A GOOD TYPIST, YOU KNOW, RUSTY MAYBE, BUT GIVE ME A WEEK. HOW ARE YOU AT CARRYING BABIES? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M WITH YOU ON THAT ONE. MRS. SANDERS? ARE YOU CAROLYN SANDERS? YOU HAVE VERY GOOD TASTE IN MEN. IS IT TRUE A FAST HEARTBEAT MEANS IT'S A GIRL? THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LIKE TO THINK. CAL PUT HIS ORDER IN FOR A SISTER? SOMETIMES I THINK I CAN FEEL IT MOVE, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. WHAT'S YOUR PREFERENCE? I HEARD ABOUT THIS WOMAN WHO HAD AN ABORTION. SHE WAS INTO HER FIFTH MONTH. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? ALASKAN LAW ALLOWS FOR TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY UP TO 21 WEEKS IF CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. WHO DECIDES ALL THAT? THE MOTHER MOSTLY. WHEN IS IT SAFEST... TO DO IT? I MEAN... AM I PAST THAT? YOU TELL DADDY, OK? I DON'T THINK I CAN BREAK ANY MORE NEWS THIS WEEK. LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN GUTS AND ANGER TO GET OUT OF THIS PIT. ASK FOR HELP. WE'RE WAY PAST COUNSELING, MOM. IT WOULD JUST BE EMPTY WORDS. PROMISES GOT LOST. IT HAPPENS. IT'S THE KIND OF WORLD WE LIVE IN. I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LORD. YOU LEFT HIM ON A SIDE ROAD A LONG WAY BACK. CAN HE MAKE THE LAST MONTH NOT HAPPEN? CAN HE BLOT OUT LAURIE MATTHEWS? NO, BUT HE CAN GIVE YOU HOPE. LISTEN, KIDDO. IF YOU DON'T GET IT, ALL THAT HURT INSIDE OF YOU, IT'S GOING TO TURN INTO SCAR TISSUE. YOU'RE GOING TO GET HARD, CAROLYN. YOU'LL BE HARD TILL THE END OF YOUR DAYS. YOU WON'T TRUST ANYBODY. GIVE IT TO THE LORD, HONEY. IF IT WAS ONLY THAT EASY. IT'S NOT EASY, BUT IT'S REAL. IT'S A WHOLE LOT BETTER. PRIDE. PRIDE'S A MIGHTY POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR WHAT THE LORD CAN DO. WELL... I'M IN FOR SOME HEAVY PRAYING. IF YOU'VE STILL GOT ANY GOOD SENSE LEFT, YOU'LL START ON YOUR KNEES. DOES CAL KNOW? HE KNOWS. I SAW IT IN HIS EYES WHEN HE LEFT. THESE CONNECTIONS SHOULD HOLD TEMPORARILY. I'VE GOT AN ALL-BAND SHORT WAVE RIG AT HOME SOMEWHERE. BATTERY-POWERED. IT WOULD BE JUST THE THING FOR UP HERE. I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET IT. MY BOY MADE THAT OLD RADIO WHEN HE WAS 15. HE WOULD TELL ME IT COULD PICK UP INVISIBLE WAVES AND MAKE THEM TALK. I NEVER SAW THEM, BUT ONE DAY HE FIRED IT UP, AND THERE THEY WERE. THAT WAS THE DAY I KNEW MY BOY WAS SMARTER THAN ME. I'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH ALL MY STUFF ANYWAY. I'LL BE MAKING A MOVE SHORTLY. YOU'D BE DOING ME A FAVOR TAKING IT OFF MY HANDS. YEAH. YOUR BOY SAID THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME REARRANGING GOING ON AT YOUR HOUSE. WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH A DIFFICULT TIME LATELY. YOU KNOW THAT OLD RADIO TAUGHT ME PLENTY. YOU TAKE THAT HOUR OF DECISION. YOU KNOW, OLD BILLY GRAHAM. HE COMES UP WITH A LOT OF STUFF TO CHEW ON. IT'S LIKE THOSE RADIO WAVES. THEY'RE ALWAYS OUT THERE, BUT YOU GOT TO TUNE THEM IN. SEEMS TO ME THAT A NOW-AND-THEN FATHER WON'T WORK FOR A LAD LIKE YOURS. TIME AND MILES KIND OF GETS IN THE WAY. BETTER TOTE SOME WATER. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? JAKE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? HEY, JAKE. WHERE DID YOU GO? I WAS JUST LOOKING AROUND. WHAT IS THIS PLACE? I COME HERE WHEN I FEEL A NEED. HOW CAN YOU HAVE A CHURCH WITHOUT PEOPLE? IS THIS WHERE YOU PRAY? YEP. I DON'T THINK MY DAD PRAYS. WELL, MAYBE HE AIN'T NEVER STARED DOWN A BEAR BEFORE. HEY, DAD! HEY, DAD! LOOK WHAT I FOUND. SON, THAT'S OLD. WHERE'S JONATHAN? I THINK HE'S STARTED SUPPER. OK. JONATHAN, LOOK WHAT I FOUND. I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THOSE IN YEARS. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'LL HIRE YOU OR NOT. PRETTY SCRAWNY FOR A MINER. BEANS MUST BE YOUR FAVORITE. COMPLAINING ABOUT THE GRUB? TRY ANOTHER HOTEL. AND THAT'S WHAT I SAID TO SWEENY. OLD SWEENY RAN ONE CREW UP THERE IN THE NORTH SHAFT, AND I RAN THE OTHER. WE BORED AND GOUGED A TUNNEL CLEAN THROUGH TO THE HEART OF MYSTERY MOUNTAIN. DID YOU EVER FIND GOLD? THEY MUST'VE TAKEN MILLIONS OUT OF THESE HILLS OVER THE YEARS. BUT OLD SWEENY WAS DANG SURE HE NEVER HIT THE GLORY HOLE. KEPT INSISTING IT WAS BACK UP ON THE OTHER SIDE, SOMEPLACE NEAR THE NORTH SHAFT. HE USED TO GO UP THERE AT NIGHT, SCRATCHING AROUND IN THAT BLACK MAZE. THE ONLY LIGHT HE HAD WAS ONE JUST LIKE THAT ONE. OLD SWEENY. HE HAD A HABIT OF SINGING DEEP DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE MINE. HE COULDN'T CARRY A TUNE WORTH SPITTING AT, BUT HE SURE COULD MAKE THAT MOUNTAIN MOAN. SOMETIMES WE'D HEAR HIM UP THERE AT NIGHT BELLOWING DEEP DOWN IN THE PIT. SOUNDED LIKE SOME WEIRD WIND HOWLING. THEN ONE DAY, OLD SWEENY TURNED UP MISSING. ALL HIS STUFF WAS STILL IN THE DORMITORY, SO WE FIGURED HE MUST BE ABOUTS. SOMEONE THOUGHT THEY'D HEARD HIM UP IN THE NORTH SHAFT THE NIGHT BEFORE. WE LOOKED ALL THROUGH THOSE TUNNELS. THE ONLY THING WE EVER FOUND WAS HIS CARBIDE HEAD LAMP. JUST LIKE THIS ONE. MAYBE OLD SWEENY EVEN USED IT ONCE. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? SOME SAY HE JUST UP AND LIT OUT OF THE COUNTRY. AND OTHERS THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE LOST HIS LAMP AND GOT HIMSELF TWISTED UP BACK IN THOSE TUNNELS, WENT INSANE IN THE BLACKNESS. SOME NIGHTS WHEN THE WIND WHIPS AROUND THE MOUNTAIN, IT KIND OF REMINDS ME OF OLD SWEENY SINGING. SOMETHING WRONG, LARRY? MY HAND, I-- DAD! DAD! HELP ME GET HIM ONTO THE BED. WHAT'S WRONG? LARRY, CAN YOU HEAR ME? DAD! I'LL HAVE TO GO FOR HELP. HEY, WE FACED DOWN THAT BEAR TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE? YEAH. AND WE'LL MANAGE THIS. OK. NOW, IF YOUR DAD WAKES, GIVE HIM SOME WATER, BUT MAKE HIM ASK REAL HARD. AND DON'T LET HIM GET UP FOR NOTHING. OK. GOOD. JAKE, YOU STAY. [DOG WHIMPERS] JESUS, I'M A FRIEND OF JONATHAN'S. MAYBE YOU ALREADY KNOW, BUT MY DAD'S HURT REAL BAD. WELL, I'M REALLY WORRIED. GOD, CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE MY DAD WELL? JESUS, COULD YOU CHECK UP ON JONATHAN, MAKE SURE HE'S OK, TOO? [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! HEY, JONATHAN. JONATHAN! WE'LL WAIT HERE, SON. NEVER GOING TO LOVE ANYONE THE WAY I LOVE YOU. MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T TALK NOW, OK? WE ALL NEED YOU, CAROLYN. YOUR HUSBAND HANDLED SURGERY WELL. HE'S HAD A SEVERE CONCUSSION WITH INTERNAL BLEEDING. WE TOOK CARE OF THAT-- NO PARALYSIS. HE'S IN RECOVERY NOW. HE SHOULD SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT. I'LL LOOK IN ON HIM IN THE MORNING. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. DENNIS HOBART. DENNIS HOBART. PLEASE CALL 610. HEY, SWEETHEART. COME ON, HONEY. WAKE UP. DON'T NORMALLY POKE MY NOSE INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS, MA'AM, BUT CAL, HERE NOW, HE GOT ME TO THINKING. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A BOY OF MY OWN. OH? HAVING CAL AROUND STIRRED UP A LOT OF MEMORIES THAT... THAT I'D PACKED AWAY. YOU KNOW, AFTER MY MISSIS PASSED ON... THANKS. ME AND MY BOY HAD A TERRIBLE FALLING OUT. OH, THE REASON SEEMED IMPORTANT AT THE TIME, BUT NOW THAT I LOOK BACK ON IT, IT DIDN'T AMOUNT TO A HILL OF BEANS. IT'S OCCURRING TO ME THAT I'M THE LOSER. WHAT DID LARRY TELL YOU ABOUT US? MOSTLY THAT--THAT YOU WERE A FINE WOMAN, AND THAT HE'D CAUSED YOU CONSIDERABLE HURT. BLAME'S A FUNNY THING-- EASY TO SHOP FOR, BUT IT ALWAYS COSTS TOO MUCH. JONATHAN. LOOK WHAT I FOUND. JUST LIKE DAD PROMISED. HEY, THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING. [MUSIC PLAYING] BOY, THAT'S A MIGHTY EXPENSIVE PRESENT. WE OWE YOU A GREAT DEAL, MR.... SORRY. WHAT'S YOUR FAMILY NAME? JONATHAN WILL BE FINE. YOU KNOW, IT WORKED OUT REAL GOOD, SON, ME BEING HERE IN TOWN, WITH BILLY GRAHAM BEING IN THE AREA. I'VE GOT TO GET TO THAT SULLIVAN ARENA. HEY, THAT'S TOO FAR TO WALK. WE'LL TAKE YOU, JONATHAN. WON'T WE, MOM? MAY NEVER HAVE A MOMENT LIKE THIS IN THIS GENERATION, SO PRAY AND COME. DURING THIS CRUSADE, GOD IS NEAR. PEOPLE HAVE PRAYED. PEOPLE HAVE WORKED. THIS HASN'T TAKEN PLACE BY ACCIDENT. YOU'RE NOT HERE TO SEE A SHOW OR HEAR BILLY GRAHAM... WE'RE LOOKING FOR SEATS. RIGHT DOWN THAT NEXT AISLE. PROBABLY THE WORLD'S MOST PRAYED SPOT. PEOPLE EVERYWHERE KNOW WE'RE HERE FOR THIS CRUSADE, AND THEY'RE PRAYING FOR ALASKA. AND SOMEWHERE DOWN IN AFRICA, THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE ALASKA IS, BUT THEY KNOW THERE'S AN EVANGELISTIC CAMPAIGN ON IN A PLACE CALLED ALASKA. AND IN ANSWER TO THEIR PRAYERS, YOU'RE HERE, AND YOU'RE CLOSER TO GOD'S KINGDOM THAN YOU'LL EVER BE AGAIN. ANY CHANCE FOR THREE SEATS? COME WITH URGENCY. SEEK THE LORD WHILE HE CAN BE FOUND BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU WON'T FIND HIM. HE'S NEAR NOW. JESUS OF NAZARETH IS PASSING BY. HE MAY NEVER COME THIS WAY AGAIN. SOME OF US WOULD HAVE CHRIST CHEAP, BUT THE PRICE WILL NOT COME DOWN. THE PRICE IS THE CROSS, FOR HE DIED AND SHED HIS BLOOD FOR YOU. IF YOU'D HAVE BEEN THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD, HE'D HAVE STAYED THERE FOR YOU. HE THOUGHT OF YOU AND SAW YOU WHEN HE WAS ON THAT CROSS. THAT'S THE WAY GOD LOOKS AT US. WE LOOK AT OURSELVES AND SAY WE'RE ALL RIGHT. BUT WHEN WE LOOK THROUGH THE EYES OF GOD'S HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS, WE'RE SINNERS. WE'RE FLAWED. SO THAT DRIVES ME TO THE CROSS, AND I SAY THERE, "GOD HAVE MERCY ON ME, A SINNER." AND CHRIST AT THAT MOMENT PROVIDES YOU WITH A RIGHTEOUSNESS ACCEPTABLE TO GOD THAT YOU COULD NOT EARN. SO I'M CLOTHED TONIGHT IN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I'M GOING TO HEAVEN NOT BY MY OWN EFFORTS, NOT BY PREACHING TO PEOPLE. I'M GOING THERE BY THE MERCY OF GOD, SOMETHING I DON'T DESERVE. BECAUSE WHEN HE SAID, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?" IN THAT TERRIBLE MOMENT, HE WAS ALONE. GOD WAS LAYING UPON HIM THE SINS OF US ALL. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HE WAS MADE TO BE SIN FOR US. MADE TO BE SIN FOR YOU. THAT MEANS HE TOOK YOUR SINS AND BECAME GUILTY OF YOUR SINS. AND YOU'RE GOING TO WALK OUT OF HERE THROUGH THIS OR THAT DOOR IN A FEW MINUTES, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MADE A DECISION, YES OR NO... ABOUT CHRIST. SOME OF YOU MAY SAY, "I'LL COME BACK ANOTHER NIGHT." YOU MAY NOT. I HOPE YOU DO, BUT YOU MAY NOT. "I'LL PUT IT OFF UNTIL SOME OTHER OCCASION "WHEN THINGS ARE STRAIGHTENED OUT AT HOME BETTER, I'VE GOTTEN MY ACT TOGETHER, I'LL COME TO GOD." YOU'LL NEVER GET IT TOGETHER. AND THAT'S THE REASON YOU CAN'T COME TO CHRIST INTELLECTUALLY ALONE. YOU CAN'T THINK YOUR WAY TO GOD ALONE BECAUSE YOUR MIND... I NEVER HAD A DEEP SENSE OF MYSELF. I'M NOT SURE WHY. OH, GOD, IF I'VE LOST ANY SENSE OF YOU... I MOVED OUT ON MY OWN. I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PRAY LIKE MOTHER... EXPECTING ANSWERS. BUT LET ME KNOW THAT YOU ARE HERE, GOD... THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ME... IN US. SIN HAS AFFECTED YOUR WILL. WHEN I WANT TO TALK, WHY DO YOU BACK OFF? JESUS SAID THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE. KNOW CHRIST'S TRUTH TONIGHT. HE CAN FREE YOU AND GIVE YOU THE JOY AND PEACE IN YOUR HEART. COME. THAT'S THE MESSAGE. THAT'S THE GREAT MESSAGE FROM THE CROSS. COME TO THE CROSS WHERE THE BLOOD WAS SHED FOR YOU. COME TO THE CROSS AND FIND NEW LIFE, PURPOSE, AND MEANING IN YOUR LIFE. CAN YOU EVER REJECT CHRIST FROM THE CROSS WITH THAT BLOOD STREAMING DOWN HIS SIDES, HIS HANDS, HIS FACE WHERE THEY PULLED HIS BEARD, HIS HEAD WHERE THEY PUT THE CROWN OF THORNS? HE'S DYING IN YOUR PLACE, SAYING FROM THE CROSS, "I LOVE YOU," AND THEN TO REJECT IT? NOBODY IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY HAS THE ANSWERS THAT HE HAS. HE SAID, "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO MAN COMETH TO THE FATHER BUT BY ME." HERE HE IS, CLAIMING TO BE THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL TRUTH, ALL SCIENTIFIC, ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL TRUTH, ALL SOCIOLOGICAL TRUTH, ALL SPIRITUAL TRUTH, ALL MORAL TRUTH. "I AM THE TRUTH." NOW THAT'S SOME STATEMENT. HE MUST HAVE BEEN A LIAR OR AN EGOMANIAC THAT DESERVED PSYCHIATRIC CARE, OR HE WAS WHO HE CLAIMS TO BE. HE CLAIMED TO BE THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE. NOBODY COULD GET TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD EXCEPT THROUGH HIM. AND ONE DAY I ACCEPTED THAT BY FAITH AS A FACT, AND IT CHANGED MY LIFE. I TALKED TO MY WIFE TODAY AND WENT OVER PART OF THIS SERMON WITH HER BECAUSE SHE'S THE BEST SERMONIZER I KNOW. AND SHE'S MY BEST CRITIC AND GIVES ME MORE MATERIAL. SHE'S GOT STACKS ON MARRIAGE. I THINK SHE COLLECTED IT FOR OUR OWN MARRIAGE THINKING SHE'D NEED IT OCCASIONALLY, AND SHE HAS. SOMEONE ASKED HER ONE TIME, HAD SHE EVER THOUGHT OF DIVORCE, AND SHE SAID, "NO, BUT I HAVE THOUGHT OF MURDER." AND, UH... YOU KNOW THERE'S A TREMENDOUS SATANIC ATTACK AGAINST THE HOME TODAY, AND SO-CALLED CHRISTIAN HOMES ARE NOT EXEMPT. EVERYWHERE I HEAR OF CHRISTIAN COUPLES WITH TENSIONS AND PROBLEMS, EITHER SEPARATED OR HEADED FOR THE DIVORCE COURT. WHY? HOW COULD THIS BE? BECAUSE THEY'VE TRAGICALLY SIDESTEPPED GOD'S PLAN FOR MARRIAGE-- ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN, GROWING IN LOVE FOR A LIFETIME. I WANT WHAT I WANT. I WANT IT NOW. ME FIRST. AND THAT CHOICE CAN WOUND YOUR LIFE FOREVER. AND ONE PARTNER FAILS, AND THE OTHER FEELS BETRAYED. THEN THE WALLS GO UP. AND WHEN THE SEASONS CHANGE AND THE WINDS OF STRESS BLOW ON SUCH MARRIAGES, THE RELATIONSHIP THAT SHOULD HOLD THEM TOGETHER CRUMBLES. YOU NEED CHRIST. I KNOW THAT HE CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE. HE CAN MAKE YOU A NEW CREATION. HE'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. HE'LL SATISFY YOUR HEART. HE'LL FORGIVE THE PAST, WHATEVER IT IS. I'M ASKING YOU TONIGHT TO DO SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE ON EVERY CONTINENT. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO WHAT WE'VE SEEN THEM DO. WHAT I SAW PEOPLE EVEN IN THE SOVIET UNION DO. I'M ASKING YOU TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME STAND IN FRONT OF THIS PLATFORM AND SAY BY COMING, "I'VE SINNED AGAINST GOD. "I MAY BE THE BEST CHURCH MEMBER, "BUT I FEEL LIKE A HYPOCRITE. "I HAVE REALLY NOT RECEIVED CHRIST "INTO MY HEART AS I SHOULD. "TONIGHT I WANT TO MAKE SURE. "I WANT MY LIFE CHANGED. I WANT PURPOSE AND MEANING IN MY LIFE." YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON WITH YOUR WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF YOU. IT MAY BE ONE DAY, IT MAY BE 1,000 DAYS. WE DON'T KNOW. BUT GOD HAS SPOKEN TO YOU TONIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT. GET UP, COME AND STAND HERE, AND BY STANDING HERE YOU'RE SAYING SILENTLY, "I OPEN MY HEART TO CHRIST. "I'M WILLING TO CHANGE MY WAY OF LIFE. I RECEIVE HIM AS MY LORD, MY MASTER, MY SAVIOR." [CONGREGATION] ♪ JUST AS I AM ♪ ♪ WITHOUT ONE PLEA ♪ ♪ ALAS THY BLOOD ♪ ♪ WAS SHED FOR ME ♪ ♪ AND AT LAST A PEACE ♪ ♪ WILL COME TO ME ♪ ♪ O LAMB OF GOD ♪ ♪ I COME ♪ ♪ I COME ♪♪ PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT HERE TONIGHT AS A FAMILY. BUT CHANGE CAN START RIGHT NOW IN YOUR FAMILY WITH YOU. YOU WILL DISCOVER THE GREAT POWER OF BIBLE READING AND PRAYER. IT'LL SPREAD TO OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TONIGHT TO MEET JESUS CHRIST. YOU'LL NEVER BE DISAPPOINTED IN HIM. I'M GOING DOWN TO THANK JESUS FOR HELPING DAD. I'M ASKING YOU TO MAKE SURE CHRIST LIVES IN YOUR HEART. GET UP AND COME... QUICKLY. HE'LL FORGIVE ALL THE PAST. HE'LL MAKE YOU THE RIGHT KIND OF HUSBAND, THE RIGHT KIND OF WIFE, THE RIGHT KIND OF BOY, THE RIGHT KIND OF GIRL. COME PUBLICLY AS HE CAME PUBLICLY FOR YOU. IF THERE'S A DOUBT IN YOUR HEART, YOU COME AND MAKE SURE TONIGHT. A MARRIAGE THAT BEGINS AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS IS ONE IN WHICH YOU SAY BY GOD'S GRACE, I REALLY LOVE YOU AND ACCEPT YOU AND FORGIVE YOU AS GOD HAS LOVED AND ACCEPTED ME AND FORGIVEN ME. THERE'S GOING TO STILL BE PROBLEMS, BUT NOW YOU'LL HAVE THE SAME GROUND TO WALK ON. LARRY? I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HERE. YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO SHOW WHAT I FEEL. YOU GOT TO PRY IT OUT OF ME. IT'S BEEN LIKE... GETTING A REPORT CARD WHEN YOU'RE A KID, FINDING OUT THAT EVERYTHING YOU DID JUST DIDN'T MAKE THE GRADES. I NEVER WANTED MY LIFE TO BE JUST PATCHED-UP COMPROMISES. I GUESS... WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS... I'M SORRY, TOO. SOMETHING HAPPENED TONIGHT. IT GAVE ME HOPE FOR US. YOU'LL BE SURPRISED WHEN YOU HEAR. LETTER WRITING HAS NEVER BEEN MY STRONG SUIT, JAKE, BUT YOU CAN'T TELL OTHER PEOPLE TO MEND THEIR FENCES IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN. YOU REMEMBER ETHAN, DON'T YOU, JAKE? YOU AND HIM USED TO SPEND YOUR DAYS TAILING RABBITS. HOW SHOULD I START? DEAR SON... DON'T FAINT DEAD AWAY, AT LEAST NOT UNTIL YOU HEAR ME OUT. JESUS SAID THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES OVER THE WORLD LIKE THE WIND, TOUCHING WHOM HE WILL. WATCHING THIS STORY, HAVE YOU SENSED GOD'S SPIRIT CALLING YOU? WHAT CAROLYN EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHT IN SULLIVAN ARENA THE BIBLE CALLS BEING BORN FROM ABOVE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE IT ALL WORKED OUT THE INSTANT SHE CAME FORWARD, BUT SHE DID KNOW THAT SHE WANTED TO CHANGE AND ASKED GOD TO TOUCH HER LIFE. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS REPENTANCE. JESUS SAID, "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE." I ACCEPTED THAT FACT ONE DAY BY FAITH, AND IT CHANGED MY LIFE IN WAYS I NEVER DREAMED POSSIBLE. NONE OF US DESERVES SALVATION. IT IS GOD'S FREE GIFT TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE. WHATEVER YOUR SITUATION, AND ONLY YOU AND THE LORD KNOW FOR SURE, THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HE READS ALL HEARTS, AND THAT HE STANDS READY TO FORGIVE YOU AND GIVE YOU PEACE AND ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH HIS SON. LET GOD SHOW YOU HIS WAY. GOD BLESS YOU.
