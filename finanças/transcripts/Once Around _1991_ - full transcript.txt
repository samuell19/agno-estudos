You can't believe the dresses that they make in Tokyo. - I would love to buy you a dress from Tokyo. - Wow! My dad used to sing that song to my mother. "Fly Me to the Moon." I, of course, was born in the '40s, when they wrote incredible songs. That's why I have such intense passions.Oh. I believe that 100%. I mean, I know all those songs 'cause of my dad, and... Hell.

You know, Sam, I saw you for the very first time, standing as you looked out at the ocean... Yeah? and the moment I saw you, a voice inside me said: "I'm gonna kiss this guy in front of an altar with God as a witness." It did? That voice inside me. Yeah? I've never heard it, ever, until I saw you. I can't believe this. I can't believe you're driving me here. Why? It's only logical. You wouldn't let me feed you baby shrimp in New York. Daddy. Renata! Daddy! What are you doing here? Oh, God, I'm so happy to see you. Daddy, um... God. Oh, oh. Let me shake the hand of the first man that my little rosebud ever loved. Daddy, you're coming in there.

So, uh, he detoured Renata in New York City, - just so he can drive back to Boston. - How nice. If I had my way, I'd have driven her all the way to California. Well, how do you like the job? You love it? Mmm. I learned I wouldn't be good at selling condos. She'd be sensational. It just wasn't the right place for her. - Really. - So, uh, you're back to where you started. Well, not really, Dad. "Not really, Dad." What's that supposed to mean? Hi, Tony! Tony! Come on. Come meet him. Hi, Tony. Hey, Renata! You're home early. How's the condo biz? This is Sam.

Or a priest or Jan or a medical doctor or... I'm clutching for dear life in there, okay? Hell... I've been split down the middle. Split down the fucking middle. I've been flung into this wasteland to figure out how come two plus two made five. And at the same time, I feel like I'm gonna turn into a white flame and suddenly go pfft! Disintegrate. And you ask me if I'm okay? That's not the point! That's just not the point! The point is, I don't want to be told when to go to bed. All right. Stay up late. No problem. You bet. You bet I'm staying up late if I want. Okay, Mom? Okay. Sure. You stay up as late as you want. And then again, I just might go right to bed. - That's okay too. - Sure. Absolutely.

Sam, what are you doing? Get out of the car. Come on. Come on. Sam, we're on the bridge. Come on. Where are we going? Trust me. It's cold out here. Renata, when I was eight years old... I used to stare at the photo of my grandfather, who was a general in Lithuania. What are you talk... We were talking about me back... Wait, wait... Wait, wait, wait. Wait. I used to... I used to say to myself: "Sam, the blood of this powerful, virile man is coursing through your veins." And I would get so, I would... I would get... I would run out of the room, dying to do something decisive. And I would say, "Mommy, Mommy! Did I really suck on your tits when I was a little boy?" Sa... Sam! What are you talking about? Oh! I'm freezing. Let's go back in the car. What am I talkin' about? I'm trying to tell you that from the first minute I ever saw you... Renata, look at you. Look at you. Everything you do. The way you eat your food. The way... The way you... you put on your shoes. The way your eyes are looking at my mouth when I'm talking to you. Renata, you name anything you do. The way you hug your mother. The way you talk to your family. You move me. Give me the phone. Sonny! Give me the phone. What're you doing? I'm dialing my accountant's number. I'm gonna look at the Charles River every day for the rest of my life. And when he asks me why am I moving my business from New York to Boston, I'll be able to say to him: "Cause, man, I is in love." Mar, give me the needle-nose again. Yeah. Coming up. He lives in New York City. I'm glad too. I'll get it. Imagine that guy on a day-to-day basis? Marilyn Bella? Oh, my word! Oh, will you look at this! Look what Sam sent. Look at that. Is he darling? Oh, I've never seen so many flowers in my life. Are those American Beauties? I don't know why I'm putting in this fixture? I'm 140 years old today. You'd think my goddamn son, your husband, would help out. He had to go watch that plumber. I don't look that old, do I? No. You look great, Dad. Thanks, honey. So wait a minute. Renata really likes this guy? Likes him? She's almost as enthused as your mother-in-law. Ta-da. I told you, Marilyn. Don't do anything fancy for my birthday. Oh, I suppose you think this cake is for you, huh? It's not for you. Can't you just one time accept something without spoiling it with your thinking? There was never a day I could or would court you like that. All I wanted to do was... sit on the stoop and hold your hand.Yeah. Me too. Isn't it funny? On the one lousy day you wanna put a gun in your mouth, everybody wants to come over to celebrate. Yeah, that's 'cause we love you. - You want some coffee, baby? - Renata, I want you to try the greatest chocolate cake you've ever eaten. Sam, don't believe anything he says. How about you, Sam? More coffee? Thank you very much. Marilyn, where's the bananas? Bananas. You got it. Tony, Gail... go. Don't have eat it yet. Don't eat it? Okay, okay, okay. I was going to get it myself. Sit down, Marilyn, sit. I am. - Where's the cream? - The cream. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You ruined it. You ruined it. She ate it. She ate it. She ate it. Sam, you got presents. Okay, Sam. I got it. Uh, Joe... Why don't you, uh, answer the doorbell? Ma! Why? I think it's right that you answer your doorbell. All right. What's going on? Just do it, Dad. Answer the door. What's goin' on? You'll see. What's up? Hello. You are Mr. Joe Bella? That's me. Look at his face! Come on, Joe. Come on! Ooh! That's it! Oh, whoa, whoa! Way to go! Yeah, you! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Come on, keep up.

She probably sat in museums all day. Sam, come here. Sam, this is my sister Jan. And this is her husband Peter. How are ya? This is Sam Sharpe. I hope you both have a lifetime of great sex and joy. Well, that's what it's all about, isn't it? Hey, Miss! Why don't we have something to eat? I'm starving. Let's all go to the kitchen and sing "Happy Birthday" to Daddy again. No, for chrissake, lay off with the birthday. No more. Wait for us, okay? We'll wait. Don't give me the birthday, okay? Oh, thank you, I will. That's sweet. Bye-bye! Why didn't you ask your friend to join us for cake? Oh, no, no. She wouldn't want to stay here with a bunch of strangers. She'd rather go home, you know, with her tits full of cash. Ha. She's married. She's dyin' to get out of here. Joe! Yeah! She said "Happy birthday" in Lithuanian! So, we'll be in here. Yeah. Oh, my God. I saw you come home last night. Jim! I need you! God, I need you.Jim. Remember how you, uh, needed me at your wedding, and you couldn't explain it? Yeah. You really missed me, didn't you? I met a woman. She's phenomenal. She asked me to marry her. I want you there. Next, uh, Thursday. You have to be there. How could you meet a woman? I've been away only... A bar. - A bar? - Yeah. And you're gonna marry someone you met in a bar?

You used to talk about having a job, but... I'm asking how you feel about Sam. What do you think? I think you should take it slow. I thought you were supposed to be selling condos by now. And what are you doing that's so goddamn important? At least I'm worried about my future, not avoiding it. Oh, give me a break. You're so stuck here. Me? Ha! Your feet are nailed to the fucking kitchen floor. You don't do anything without Daddy's permission. Or is it Sam's now? I'm mean, at least I... I... What? Have Peter? Or is it Jim? I saw you this morning. I'm just asking you to give me and Sam the same kind of consideration... you give a neighbor. Come on, Renata. I mean, you hardly know the guy. I mean, for chrissakes, he puts money in women's breasts. Okay, fine. You can just screw off, okay? Just screw off. Oh, yeah, right.

What's the matter? Huh? I'm sorry to wake you, but... I cannot sleep unless I say the following. Uh, then say it, then. Does anyone care... that Renata's spending day and night with some bozo? Renata doesn't think he's a bozo. Ma! We don't know a thing about this guy, do we? Do you, Dad? No. Uh, no, not really. He could be a criminal. Oh! No. I should know more about him. We should. We all should. And why is he living with us? He's not living with us. What do you mean, he's not living with us? Is he here? He's here. Do I see him in bed or not? He's visiting. Well, okay. Technically he's not living with us, but he's here. He's staying here. That's what she's asking us. Is that what you're asking? Exactly. He's living with us for some weird reason. Hey, I think we should just stay out of it. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Marilyn... I mean, goddamn it, he's been with us long enough. Enough is enough. I'm sick and goddamned tired of-of smelling smoke and-and drinking vodka. I'm sick of it. Sick, sick! I'm sick of it! That's what I am. Janny, she's awfully happy. Come on! Come on! Ho! Hey. Oh! Ow! Oh! Whiplash! Ow, whiplash! Come on, pull over. Let me see your license! Come on. Come on, out! Daddy, he's more excited about this wedding than anyone. Crazy wedding, crazy wedding. All my instincts tell me, "Take this kitten aside and say, 'â€˜What's your rush?'" Well, sometimes people know. They just know like that, Dad. They're in love. I'm glad you're so open-minded, Jan. Peter, come on! Listen, Renata. Let's forget about the other day, okay? I overreacted. I'm sorry. I was a real bitch. I just want you to be happy. And you're right. No. I understand your concerns. I do. I'm gonna cool my jets with Sam. We are gathered here to unite in holy wedlock... Jim Redstone and Honey Beach. Do you, Jim Redstone, take Honey Beach... for your lawful wedded wife? To love, to honor and to cherish all the days of your life? I do. Uh, do you, Honey Beach, uh, take Jim Redstone... I, Sam Sharpe, take Renata Bella... to be my lawful wedded wife. To love and to honor... Stop it! and to cherish all the days of my life. That's not funny. - Say the vows to me. - Come on. I do. Say it, Renata. Leave me alone. I, Jim Redstone... I, Jim Redstone... take thee, Honey Beach... take thee, Honey Beach... to be my lawful wedded bride. I, Renata Bella, take Sam Sharpe... Sam! This is not a fun game. And now you, Honey, repeat after me. I, Honey Beach... I, Honey Beach... I, Renata Bella, take Sam Sharpe... to be my lawful wedded husband. My lawful wedded husband. To love, honor and cherish... all the days of my life? Then may God bless you both. And I now pronounce you man and wife. I would like to propose a toast. A toast. Those of you who know me even a little bit by now... aren't gonna be surprised to hear that I would like to make a toast... to the consummate happiness of Jim and Honey. Hear, hear. Hear, hear. Jim is a heck of a guy. I don't know him well myself, but could tell by the way Jan is sweet on him... that he must be one heck of a swell guy. And, Honey... Well, I don't need to say a lot about Honey. We did get a chance to get acquainted a little bit... in the men's room a few minutes ago. Just kidding. Just kidding. All right, all kidding aside, to Jim and Honey. Hear, hear.Jim. Now don't finish. Don't finish. Just leave a little bit. Um... Inspired by the great happiness and joy that I see around us, by the shining example of Mr. Joe Bella and his lovely wife Marilyn, by darling Jan, their daughter, and her lovely husband Peter, I would like to take this opportunity... to announce the engagement... Miss Renata Bella to Sam Sharpe IV. Oh, yeah! There is an old Lithuanian proverb. It goes... Roughly translated that means, "Dogs can't make their dreams come true, so people have to." And I just did. Oh, wow. Congratulations. Congratulations to you. Come on, once around... for the bride. It's a fertility rite. Eggs, bread... They're dancing with genitals. Oh, come on, Joe. They are not. Look at that car. I can't believe all this. I mean, look at it. It's like he's purchasing her. How can she do that? Dad. Look, I'm old-fashioned, and I'm as sexist as the next guy, but, Christ, I have always treated your mother as an equal. Dad, we've all got to let Renata live her own life now, all right? Such a nice ceremony.Oh. Renata, you look beautiful. Thank you. I've been waiting for this dance... for over a quarter of a century. Ho. Ho! Hello. Hello. Hi. Come on in. Everybody, come on in. Hi. Yeah, come on down front, you little guys. Is that a rocket in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? Um... I... I'm overwhelmed. I... I am standing here in front of this microphone, and I'm... I'm overwhelmed. I'm overwhelmed by my beautiful bride. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. And I'm overwhelmed by my beautiful new mother-in-law Marilyn Bella. And I'm... I'm overwhelmed by everybody. I am... Really. Every single person in this room is... I-I... You are love. You are love embodied in great-looking outfits. Give yourself a big round of applause. Come on, really. Come on. Everybody! Yeah! Oh, oh, oh, oh. There is one person here who is Mr. Love. I'm not talking about dollars and cents... when I say that he is the richest man... in this room. He is the richest in this room because of what is in his heart. You know who I'm talking about. Let's have a round of applause for the big guy, Mr. Joe "head of the family" Bella. Joe! Come on up. Joe, come on. Joe, come on up! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! All right. Do it, Daddy! All right, all right. Uh... I'd just like to say that... Excuse me. Sorry. I'd like to sing this song to Renata. But, Sam, you should listen carefully to it... because for some reason, Renata, after meeting Sam, you were always humming this song. I mean, for some reason. It's been in the air since you two met. I know what it is. ♪ Fly me to the moon ♪ And let me play among the stars ♪ Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars ♪ In other words ♪ Hold my hand ♪ In other words ♪ Baby, kiss me ♪ Fill my heart with song ♪ And let me sing forevermore ♪ You are all I long for ♪ All I worship and adore ♪ In other words ♪ Please be true ♪ In other words ♪ I love you Yeah! Whoo! Come on! Come on. Lookin' good, girl. Oh, Renata... Renata, please put your coat on. Keep it closed. No peeking. That's it. Here we go. And a drumroll, please, ladies and gentlemen. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Do you like it? It's a pottery wheel. Look at this! Isn't it great? Very few on the market. Very... Hey! Hey, you're getting to be an expert. What is that, a flower? No, it's, uh... It's, uh, off-center a little bit. It's kind of an abstract. Marilyn. Thank you. From Renata and myself. Hope you like that. Oh, my God, will you look at this? Oh, you kids are just going crazy. We really are, Ma.Oh, they're beautiful. We're just stark raving mad. You guys are just really too much. It's so extravagant. Ma, let me see. Oh, my... Sam. I mean, we have... Look at these rocks. Oh, Daddy, this is so beautiful.Gorgeous. I'm not sure I want to be a locations analyst. Lot of money. More money than you ever dreamed of in your life. Isn't that right? It's certainly a very generous offer. Come on. Why don't you take it? It's awful. You don't even know what it is. How can you evaluate it seriously, for one? Daddy? Daddy, what do you think? Come on, why don't you give 'em a try? Try it out. I can quit. Sam, I can quit, right? Anytime. This is America. What do you think? Joe. Look at this. People used to have to... Hi.Hi. Where's Jan? Upstairs, I think.Thanks. Excuse me. Excuse me. It's the refrigerator. A lot of cashola. VCRs, uh, CDs. Digital TVs.God, Peter... Porsches, shih tzus. Guess how much. Wrong. Whatever you just thought, it's twice what you just thought. He threw me a bonus. How much of a bonus? Come on. Get it with your mouth. You know you want to. Come on! Oh, God. It's getting hard to separate you... from your professional life. Shit! What the hell was that? Wonderful. Terrific. Ma? Ma, you all right? I'm gonna put a bomb under your father's chair and I'm gonna light it. He just sits there in that robe. All day. All night. Ma, he's resting. Resting? Hey, You want to talk about work? Take a look at this place. I mean, it's making beds, hanging up clothes, dusting, mopping, cooking, doing windows. I mean, what is this supposed to be, the thrill of my lifetime? Shit! Ma, calm yourself. Oh, no, no. I'm sick of it. We were gonna travel. We were gonna go deep-sea fishing. I was going to learn Italian. I decided what I really want to do. I want to build a boat, paint it, put it to sea and die on it. Go take a flying leap. What are you doing, sleeping at 12:00 in the afternoon? Will you tell me that? I'm trying to daydream, Marilyn. Now why don't you leave me alone? Ever since I retired, you can't take it, can you? Oh! Well, I'll be at my pregnant daughter's if anyone cares. Dad? Nice view, huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, your mother, she doesn't understand. I just wanna slow it down. Do nothing. Sam could never stop working. Never. It worries me. I... I wish Sam was more like you. I wish he could just relax. You stopped working 'cause you wanted to. Now when you were Sam's age, you worked all hours too. Of course I worked all hours. - I had you. - I had Tony. Honey cakes, your big daddy's home. There he is. Throw the turkey in the oven and bend over. Hi, Sam. Dad! Hey. I was just thinking of you. Gotta go. Oh. Don't go. Hey, Joe, don't go home yet. Please. I need your help on something. I need your advice. Okay? Take just a minute. Come over here. Take a look at this. Now, which do you like better, the blue or the red? I do too. Yeah, this one is way too provocative. Now first off, you start the thing off with a goddamn question. If I were sent a brochure... which I got a shitload at work every day... and it started with a question, I'd say they're assholes. They're being provocative where I want safe. They're asking questions where I want answers. Really. Fuck 'em. I'd put it in the basket. Renata, your father is one smart cookie. No one has to tell me that. One smart cookie. What was that word that you just used? Provocative? Provocative, right. Mr. Bull's-eye. - You picked the blue, right, Joe? - Yeah. The blue. Okay. Okay. I'm going with the red. See, I'm going for the new breed. I'm going for the people who want provocative. Thank you, Joe. I really appreciate it very much. You've been very helpful. If you need an old fart, give me a call. See you later, Joe. Old fart. Daddy, can I... can I talk to you? Don't be late for your grandmother's memorial.Okay. Bye, sweetie. Why... Wh-What did you just say? What? You trapped him. - I did not. - Why'd you talk to him like that? Why did... Why did you trick him like that? I asked his opinion because I value it. No, Sam. Can't you be sensitive to another person? Don't you notice what he's going through? I think you're underestimating your father. Jesus, back off a little. I'm right on this. Honey, I think you'd better get dressed. We're getting late. ♪ Oh, Mamma ♪ Mamma Wow. All right, let's all enjoy ourselves. I like your father. That was nice, Dad. Thanks, Peter. That was great, Daddy. There's a song in Lithuanian like that. That honors the mother. Joe, that was magnificent. That was really magnificent. I don't want to hear that. Okay? But thanks, Sam. I'm not kidding. It was magnificent. Sam, cut it out. What the hell is he gonna do, make a speech now? It's not appropriate here, Renata. Hello. Hello. Greetings. Can you hear me? Can you hear... Sam, what are you doing? Um, I'm gonna sing a Lithuanian song I know about motherhood. Oh, I wish you wouldn't. Um, you know, the Bellas are a funny group, and they're very funny about the memory of their mother. Don't sing. Please don't. This is a song about a woman who is completely devoted to her son. Everything she does, every action... you know, all the cooking and cleaning, everything... is done for her son, who is... who is going on a journey. It's really... Yes, it sounds like a wonderful song, but... We'd like to hear it sometime, just not today. No, you listen and you tell me after if you think I was wrong, okay? Sam, um, I have the microphone in my hand... because I can't seem to reach you. And I know it's my fault because I probably sound as if I'm asking you not to sing. What I'm actually doing, Sam, is I'm telling you you can't. You cannot do it. Marilyn, I think this song... Let me see what's going on, Daddy. I wanna talk to Sam alone. Give me the microphone and go to your seat... and sit next to Renata where you belong. Marilyn, I want to sing a song about motherhood. Over my dead body, okay? Now go sit down. I know how you feel. I really do. Give this to me right now. I'm gonna sing this song, and I know in my heart this is the right place. It is totally the wrong place, and you are the wrong person to sing today. Now you have had free reign over us, but I'm telling you, as of this moment, it's over. I will kill you before I let you sing that song... and upset my husband and his family. Oh, go ahead. I'll kill you. Is that right? That's damn right. Marilyn, I don't believe that you really mean that. I certainly do mean it. Sam, stop it! Wait... I just... Look... Daddy, unplug this damn thing, please. All right, I have it. I have it. Take it easy. Take it easy. My God. Sam... You're tearing us all apart. Oh, God. Renata, please forgive me. I know you want me to leave you alone. I know that. I know you want to watch this, but I... I have this... I have this really bad feeling that, uh, if I walk out of the room you're gonna decide not to forgive me. I keep thinking that if I just you know, don't move and stay where I am, I'll... I'll think of something. You know, I'll... I'll just... I'll get another chance with you. I don't know... I don't know shit. Okay. Okay. There. Now you can... Now you can watch it and you don't have to look up at me. Is that you? That's me. That's me. My son's gonna have your spirit. There's Jan. And Jan's fire. Playing with Daddy. Renata, no one can tear your family apart. I hope he'll have my father's goodness... and my mother's wisdom. He will. He will. We're going to have a beautiful baby, aren't we? It's a girl! I can't believe it. Is she okay, Sam? I didn't think I could make her. Is she okay? Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's fine. Oh, baby. Hi, Ma. Are you okay? Oh, I'm pretty tired. She's beautiful. God bless you. I'm so happy to see all of you. She's got your eyes... She looks just like you. Not really, Daddy. Look at the fingers. So beautiful. Marilyn, about what happened at the memorial yesterday... Oh, no, no. That was my fault. You were just being enthusiastic. Sam. Sam, let's put all that behind us. We got good reason to look ahead. I hired the band for just 10 minutes. I thought, what the hell, you know? Here, come over here. I wanna... I wanna form a ring of love around the baby, okay? Okay, Joe? Here... Here, you-you put your left hand on Renata. That's right. Here we go. Peter, take your dad's hand. And Jan... That's it. Oh! Oh, God. That's all right. That's okay. Jan, take Peter's hand. Marilyn, you can take Tony's hand. That's it. That's it. Gail, take... There you go. That's it, honey. Thank you very much. And now Marilyn. Perfect. This is the song I wanted to sing yesterday. I know. I feel the same way. No, no, no... With the one child we only have one option. You have several options. Marilyn... Marilyn, shut up those babies, all right? Listen. Listen. All we have to get... Excuse me. All we have to get... All we have to get is a baptism date. Now, we should be capable of doing that. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I want Jan to be godmother, and I would think it would be an honor... I mean, I want Tony to be godfather. And I'd like to add that Sam here is being pretty terrific. Hell, he has friends of his own. Okay. So he's quite happy that Tony be godfather. Why do you have to have the baptism... on the first day that we are going away... - on our very first vacation in 12 years? - Because... My parents are really not going to understand... how their granddaughter is born... and is not baptized on a preordained date... Sam... that has been followed... - in Lithuanian tradition for all of their lives. - Sam. They're really not going to understand why... Excuse me. Sam... Sam, what, uh... I don't want to be rude, but your parents are dead. Exactly. That's exactly the point. The bottom line is, Tony will not give up shit to be there. The bottom line is, is that you would rather follow some absolutely bullshit tradition... rather than think about my happiness, Gail's or Mikey's. Okay, fuck you, Tony. That's the bottom line. Don't you ever say that to me again. Joe, do something. There's a baptism and there's a date. You are the godmother and you are the godfather. I hope you can fucking attend. Jan, you don't suddenly have to leave town, do you? You are such a selfish bitch. I can't believe what a selfish... Oh, God, I... - Hey... - That's it! That's it! Now the end. Done. It's finished. I want everyone out. Everyone. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Now Tony... and Gail, just go to your car and go home. You did nothing wrong. And, Jan, Peter, go to your room, please. Joe, maybe this isn't the best time... Marilyn, please. Don't you start. I know what I'm doing. Joe, uh... If it's a question of financial loss, I'd be happy to make up anything Tony feels... Sam, I don't want to discuss it further. Renata, I want you to ask Sam, because he's your husband... Ask him to wait in the car for you. Why are you acting like this, Daddy? Renata, please. Okay, Sam, will you please go wait in the car for me? What is this, Ma? Renata, I'm gonna say something for the first time in my life without consulting your mother, but I think she's gonna very much agree with me. Renata, Sam's a wonderful man. He's a generous and kind man. But he's killing us. He's killing us. Is it true, Marilyn? He means so well. Marilyn, is it true? Yeah. How can... How can you say that about Sam? He has done nothing but great, great things... Renata... for this family. Now, look, I hate to say this, but I'm more afraid of what will happen if I don't. Now, you and the baby, you're always forever welcome here, but I don't want Sam in this house again. At least, you know, not until we all get control of ourselves. See, I simply don't know what else to do. I'm sorry. Well, why don't you just get a gun and blow my head off? 'Cause if Sam's not welcome here, I'm not welcome here. My baby. In fact, why don't you just douse the place in kerosene and blow it up? Oh. And do me a favor. Do not come to the baptism. You're not welcome. - Renata, wait. - No! You wait! That man... I know he's different. I love that he's different. I love that he flatters me and he flatters Mom and Gail and Tony and Jan and you. Hell, Peter copies him. You're impressed by him. So what, he gives gifts? Big deal he's arrogant. Why shouldn't he be? He's remarkable! This is my adventure, Dad, my goddamn adventure. If you don't get it, well, I'm sorry. I take it back. I'm not sorry. No way! Once I thought... no, once I wished... that my parents would drive off the road in their car and die. 'Cause then I'd be different. Those are your parents, Renata. Your irreplaceable parents. Don't ever talk like that. Okay, Sam. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's all right. Drop it like that... It's all right. I've got it. I've got it. Renata? We're here. Renata? Come on. Hello, Sam. This is the godmother. ...godmother or what? It's them. That's my family. Jan, Tony. Oh, Tony. Tony. You're supposed to be up here. Tony, Jan. Get up there. Sorry, Dad. Yeah, yeah. Button your coat. Button it. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Just take the cap off. Remove the cap. Yes. They pour water on her forehead. Sam... Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Sam... Lift his head. Get an ambulance. Sam. So, Mom, butter's got 35 milligrams of cholesterol. What's that, per ounce? No, that's one tablespoon. So with cholesterol deposits in the arteries, definitely no butter for Sam. Yeah, but turkey is great, isn't it? Yeah, but dark meat is saturated with double fat proteins. Okay, we'll give Sam all the white meat.Right. You know, maybe we shouldn't even serve wine. I'm shocked by every person in this house. Mom? Mom, I know it'd be better to clear a path to the back. It'd be longer that way, and those extreme swings in temperature... that can cause a real shock the circulatory system of a heart patient, so... Well, it's safer to stay with the front then, I think. Yeah, I think so. Christ! You've all gone nuts. Sam comes up the front walk, and if he wants to go out and make a fucking snowman, he'll do it. If he wants to smoke a pack of cigarettes, he'll smoke a pack of cigarettes. Dad, he'd die if he smoked. Just die. Think of Renata, Joe.Yeah. On the tree. No, really, Dad. Normally a guy wants to jump out a window, okay, but this is different now. It's kinder to let the man be a free man. Just think about that. Answer the door. Hey, doll.Hi. He's here. He's doing fine... Hi, Ma.Hi, darling. Although his bronchial tubes suddenly restricted, but his inhaler regulated him immediately. Thank God. Merry Christmas! Merry, merry. - Merry Christmas, Sam. - Merry Christmas to you. Are we glad to see you. You look fabulous. You look wonderful. You look hot. We sure are glad to see you. Sam, how are you? I'm great. How are you? - Everyone, move away. - Merry Christmas, Sam. Jesus Christ, give him some air to breathe. Yeah, he's right. Come on. Why don't you all go in the house? Let's go have some dinner. Come on. Be careful. Tony! Help your sister. You okay, buddy? In family paradise. Oh, that's so good, isn't it? Okay. Okay. Look at your aunt. Not the whipped, Ma. The roasted. Thank you. Sam? Sam, there's really good meat up here. No, no, it's okay. I tried the white. I want some dark now. Mmm. This is fabulous. Sam, they're all on the attack because you're eating dark meat. Aaah. I say, live your life, and that doesn't mean let me live it for you. Thank you very much. I just want to try a little... of Marilyn's fabulous turkey. I'm not gonna make a life habit of it. Recognize anything? That's the bowl. That's the bowl! You made it! On the thing. You made it. You did it. I can't believe it! I'm so proud of you. Well, you know, it's slightly off-center. I think it's fantastic. Look at that. It's got lines and everything. It's built like a brick shithouse. Look at that. It took me about eight and a half days to make. Mmm. I love this. It's like... It's got fruit in it. It's got utilitarian uses. And, Marilyn, you did everything like, uh... You're using it in fruit. You could use it with anything, right? Excuse me. Ren. Renata. Oh, God. Renata. I'm sorry. I'm afraid to make love to you. I'm afraid you'll die in my arms, and you're smoking. No! What are you trying to do, die? You rush into my life like a beautiful flash of light, and then just as suddenly go pfft! - Vanish. - I am not going to die on you, Renata. I'm living for the first time in my life. I could kick death in the teeth. I'd spit in its face, Renata. If death had hands, I'd chop them off. If death had eyes, I'd burn them out of its sockets for you. If death had a liver, I'd bite it out with my teeth... and stomp on it. You would, huh? I would. I would. And you know what else? What else? Come over here. Come over here and sit on my lap. No. You come to me. Okay. And if death... had a cock... If death had a cock... Hmm? Hmm? You'd kick him in the balls. And send him off squealing. Here we go. I can do it. I can do it.Okay. Hey. Hey! Hey, do you know we're gonna skate out here together one day? Yes, we are. Yes, we are. I'm gonna skate faster than anyone has ever skated in the history... of heart patients. Here. Here, here, here, here. Let's not break any records yet. There we go. There we go. So, what do you want to see? My figure eights? My spin? One leg? On one leg with a spin? What? You see that hole out there in the ice? It's like... It's like a fishing hole. It's like a pile of ice in the... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I see it. Go straight out there, and then come right back. Yeah, sure. Shh. Not bad! Not bad! Sam! Are you crazy? Let's go back. I've had enough. No, no, no. One more. The ice boat. Okay, you got it. Hey, you. Watch me go backwards. Backwards! Sam. Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam. Sam! Sam! No! Oh, no. God, no! No! No! No! No! Jan. I had the greatest time of my life. The greatest time ever. It's sleepy time. It's sleepy time for you. I used to love watching you sleep when you were that age. Why don't you come and lie down with Dad and me a few minutes? Okay? You're gonna need your strength today. Hi, doll. You gonna lie down?
