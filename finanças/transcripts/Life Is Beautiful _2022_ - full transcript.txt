Oh no… Mister! Wait! Wait! Thank you! Oh my! Excuse me. Can I borrow your lipstick? Just a bit on my hand? Thank you! Hello? Where are you? I’m almost there. I’m at Jongro 3-ga, so… What? Hello? Oh no. What? Not again! I swear I got on bus 125. But why is this bus 152? Why you! Sorry! I’ll be right there. Take a cab, not the bus again! Okay, okay. Taxi! Taxi! I don’t have all day! It’s not fatal! Why make me come? They said I need a guardian for this endoscopy. Then why are you so late! Oh my! What? What now? - Know where I am now? - You said Jongro 3-ga! Guess what I’m looking at. Who cares! Take the cab now! It’s Seoul Cinema. We used to watch movies here often. It changed so much. I can still remember Through the morning sun Your shy smile Back in those days With nowhere to go We always watched movies with morning discounts Though I said saving money was important But I really wanted to see you earlier I missed you Although our dates together Have now become like classics I sometimes miss it My young, first love Countless lovers Must still be there Making memories Like you and me In the backseat of an uncrowded theater For the first time I felt your lips To my surprise In that secret miracle I was reborn as a man Although our dates together Have now become like classics I sometimes miss it My young, first love LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL Ms. OH Se-yeon! OH Se-yeon, please! - The line is… - Yes! Where is she? It’s non-small cell carcinoma terminal lung cancer. The prognosis is not good. Maybe two months at most… Two months? Two months… October, November… My son’s college exam is in November. Ms. LEE Jin-young, please! Honey! - Oh no! - I’m sorry! So sorry. - Are you okay? - I’m fine. Honey! Couldn’t eat noodles for a change? Aren’t you sick of rice? Are you still mad? I said I’m sorry. People gave me the wrong directions. I said take a cab! Scared me. I’m sorry. Excuse us. Sorry. What did the doctor say? I don’t need the endoscopy? Min-jung’s mom said the back pain could be reflux esophagitis. And everyone coughs these days from the fine dust. Should we get an air purifier? You have lung cancer. Do you smoke? I warned you to eat rice, not junk! I said to see a doctor a thousand times! You never listened! Damn it! You’re serious? Don’t joke with me. I gotta go back to work. - It’s a wonder drug! - Seriously? Yes! He’s always tired. - You gotta hear this. - Okay. When men can’t get it up, make them take two pills. Then the next day, you won’t be able to walk! Why you! It’s important! Whatever you suggest works wonders. My sister-in-law’s mother-in-law had terminal stomach cancer. The hospital gave up and said to take her home. So I gave her some chaga mushroom like you suggested. It’s been three years and she’s still alive! My sister-in-law got so mad for saving her! - There they come. Bye! - Bye. - Call me if you want some. - Okay. Let’s go! Must I call you in here every day? Look at your skirt. Is it your underwear? I grew, so it got smaller. - If you’re vexed, get me one. - Vexed? Why you! Watch it! You’re asking for it! Hey! You! - I didn’t hit her! - You smoked? - I should cut off your wrists! - Wait! Ma’am! I’ll report you for abuse! Do it! Report your death while you’re at it! Please! Ma’am! Come back here! Open up! It’s because of that jerk with the red hair, isn’t it? Did he tell you to smoke? Don’t call him a jerk! What the hell do you know about him! Watch your tongue! Why do you keep stabbing my heart! You really wanna see me die? How annoying! You always say that! I’m the one who wants to die! How dare you say that! Open up! KANG Ye-jin! CITY HALL I’ll call you when it’s done. Is something wrong? What do you mean, chief? Why aren’t you fighting with anyone? When did I ever fight with anyone? 80 percent of the civil complaints here is for Mr. KANG Jin-bong. 89 percent, chief. Really? 89 percent? Too bad. One percent more and you’d have a nice even number. Jeez. Damn jerk! I’m not eating your damn rice! Take it back, you bastard! What? I didn’t report my wife’s death to get her pension? It’s true you didn’t report it even after three months! You got the basic allowance, pension, and disability benefits in her name! Why you! What’s with him! Sir! Damn it! Oh my! Oops. Eat the fried shrimp on the table! Son! Studied hard today? Everything going well? How do you feel? Careful you don’t catch a cold. Tell me if you get a sore throat. You have to stay away from getting sick. Why didn’t you wear the mask I gave you? You should wear it all the time. - The fine dust these days is… - Observe. What? Serve? Observe means take note, make a remark, watch. Take note… I made fried shrimp, your favorite. Drink the herbal tea too. Don’t forget to eat all the fruit for vitamins and… Come on. Tell me! What’s the matter? Is it because you failed the test for a promotion? Did the boss fire you? You should’ve watched your tongue around him. Come on. Spill it. - Chief! - What? What is life? What are you, a teenager? I’m not sure. I don’t know what to do! I have no clue. When will I know all about love? When will I know all about life? How long must I live to know? Will the day ever come? Can I turn back the clock? Please slow it down just a bit? Oh how I miss nmy glittering, good old days Today is just another day Why does time fly so fast? Sometimes, I’m surprised by my reflection in the mirror I’ve changed so much Once I had sweet dreams My heart fluttered I couldn’t sleep all night When will I know all about love? When will I know all about life? How long must I live to know? Will the day ever come? Can I turn back the clock? Please slow it down just a bit? Oh how I miss my glittering, good old days I suddenly miss my first love You must’ve changed like me Yes, I sometimes smile at the thought of you Things were great between us However This is enough We were so in love Memories can be so sweet When will I know all about love? When will I know all about life? How long must I live to know? Will the day ever come? Though many days to live remain Can I turn back the clock? Please slow it down just a bit? Oh how I miss my glittering, good old days Don’t tell the kids yet. SUMMER CLOTHES WINTER CLOTHES Damn. Eating seaweed soup is bad luck before taking exams! I forgot. I’m sorry. Sorry. What were you thinking! Take this! Where are my stockings! - It’s in your second drawer! - It’s not! It should be. Don’t pick at the food. Take big spoonsful. That’s bad luck. Can’t you look for it? - Did you pack your gym suit? - Where is it? Seo-jin! Wait! Son! Have a good day. It’s still wet. Hey! There’s no toilet paper! Hurry up! Why let the toilet paper run out like that? Look at the mess! I’ll arrange everything in order. Good! Why don’t you arrange everything else while you’re at it. Like our insurance, bank accounts, and credit cards! I have to know to manage them now! Is that all you want to know? Are you okay? Aren’t you scared? Is there nothing we can do? Aren’t you curious about that? Honey! I’m dying. They said I’m going to die! Don’t you care at all? I couldn’t sleep one bit. You snored and slept well. But I couldn’t waste a second to sleep. So I organized my clothes, but… I don’t know to throw away my summer or my winter clothes. I didn’t even wear some of them yet. I was saving them to wear next year. The tags are still on them!

BEING LOVED I can’t sleep tonight What’s that? What are you doing? I’m leaving home. What? I’m practically invisible in this house. But I have work to do. I gotta find stockings. I gotta refill the toilet paper. But I can’t stand it anymore. I quit! Cut it out. Know what today is? Right! Your birthday! I got you something. Here! Not just any birthday, my last birthday! Where’s my gift? I cook and buy cakes for all your birthdays! But why don’t you do anything for me? Think it’s a waste for a dying person? Why you! Does it cost you money to congratulate me? Congratulations. It’s tradition to eat seaweed soup on birthdays. But you won’t let us eat it because it’s bad luck? I didn’t expect anything anyway. You never bought me anything on our anniversaries or birthdays. I didn’t get birthday parties even as a kid! The only party I had in life was our wedding! Damn it! Not knowing I’d live like shit and die like this! I said that’s enough! I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t live long anyway, so I refuse to live like this! So? How are you going to live? I’m going to meet the man I love. Go ahead! Go meet him! What’s that? You find him! Who the hell is this? My first love. Your first what? Love. Why? Thought you were my first love? - What? - Did you find him yet? I’m damn busy! Bye! CHANEL $6,560 CHARGED She spent $6,560? What? What did you do? I bought a purse. - What? - I’m damn busy! Bye! Wait! Hey! Damn it! JINDO FUR $10,000 CHARGED Have you lost your mind? No one else did, so I bought myself 20 years’ worth of gifts. Like them? Aren’t they beautiful? Get down now! They say good shoes take you to good places. Maybe they’ll take me to heaven. Hey! Stop calling me that. I have a name. Look! OH Se-yeon! What’s this? Divorce? Let’s get divorced. Then half of everything is mine. I’ll spend every penny before I die! Why are you doing this? It’s unfair. I’m mad. My life with you is so pitiful, it’s making me crazy. I looked after you and the kids my whole life. All my life, I ate your cold leftovers! I wore your worn-out socks and clothes! Damn… Can’t you help me meet my first love before I die? What crazy fool would do that? So just sign the paper. Are you insane! It’s damn cold. It’s cold. Fine. Let’s go. I packed for you. Let’s just go. Jeez. Why bring that? I gotta return them! Unlock the trunk. - Don’t forget to take your vitamins. - Okay, okay. I’ll count them when I get back. Don’t party all night because we’re not home. Fine. Don’t fight with your brother. I won’t! Bye! What took you so long? So two-faced. When buying, I’m a ma’am. When refunding, I’ll be damned. - Watch your tongue. - Sorry. - Say it. - What? - The address. - What? What’s the damned fool’s address? I don’t know. What! I thought you said let’s go because you found him. How am I supposed to find him with just his name and age? You work at city hall. Can’t you find that? I’m not a NIS agent! I don’t believe this. Then let’s just go to Mokpo. Mokpo? Yup. He went to high school there. They’ll have his old address. We can start there to track him down. Man… Damn it! What? You wore makeup? The cosmetics shop did it for free. Like it? Hate it! I hate myself too I’m leaving to find my love The one who will fill my heart Where are you hiding? Please wave your hand The one to dance with me all night Someday you’ll come into my life I believe with my heart The mountain and the sun laugh at me Where did my love and youth go? Oh! The sky The birds laugh at me Countless lovers laugh at me - Now, I’m tired - Tired - Please find my love - My love The one who makes my heart skip My only love If you wave to me The sky and the clouds Will someday kneel before me I believe with my heart I hate myself too I’m leaving to find my love The one to bet my life on Where are you now? Please wave to me The one to hold me through the night Someday you will come to me I believe with my heart I know you’ll come to me I believe with my heart What took you so long? I got your favorite. Oh my! This place changed so much! Where is this place? It’s Dong-tan. Ye-jin was born here. How could I forget. I had morning sickness for nine months while pregnant with her. One day, I craved mackerel. I waited all day for you and told you I was craving it. Know what you said then? Make it! What mackerel? I can’t make that. Please? Don’t act special because you’re pregnant. Who says I am? The smell of food makes me puke. Really? It means food won’t sit well. Just starve. That’ll do the trick. Then what about your dinner? Don’t make it. I already ate. What did you eat? Mackerel bowl. The walls are so thin, I couldn’t help but hear. It’s raw skate. It smells. Can you eat it? Mokpo! Me! Mokpo! Love fish! Eat slowly. Use chopsticks. Se-yeon? What’s wrong? Is it stuck? Is the baby coming out? 911! What’s the number? Oh no! We gotta call the hospital! KANG Jin-bong! If it wasn’t for Mrs. LEE, I would’ve been in trouble. She took care of me like a mother. I wonder how she’s doing. Thinking of back then, too? I should’ve bought land here. Hey! Take them. She’ll count them. I’m staying overnight at study hall. What if they’re not practicing today? No practices before a concert? I can’t wait to see the concert tomorrow. I hope my mom doesn’t come back tomorrow. I wish she won’t come back ever. Whoa! Things haven’t changed at all. Why are you crying? It’s my hometown. I haven’t been back since my dad’s funeral. I miss my dad. He had a hard time raising me alone. Thanks to you, I got to see my dad. I guess I’ll see him soon again. MOKPO HIGH SCHOOL You raise two kids and forgot school is closed on Saturday? So clueless. You forgot too. Clueless civil servant. Why say I’m a civil servant now! A teacher said to come inside. - Really? - Yes. Heard… Is she really sick? What took you so long? Se-yeon! Se-yeon! We’re late! Just go. I’m not ready. You crazy! The broadcast club seniors will flip! Hurry! Are you enjoying your lunch? Here’s to another day together. MPBS. BROADCASTING CLUB MEETING Who’s that? PARK Jung-woo. He’s in my church choir. Do you know? How light the hand of life becomes and how songful the night, How come he can speak with no accent? His dream is to be an announcer. …when one is loving and trusting all. STUDY HALL You’re Hyun-jung’s friend, right? Yes. If you don’t have an umbrella, want to share mine? Jung-woo lives in the opposite end from your house. Dang! Jung-woo must like you! That’s crazy! Jung-woo! Listen. Like ‘Starry Night’ radio show? I applied for a live show recording. It’s an invitation. What! For real? But Seoul is far. Can you go? Yes. If Se-yeon goes, I’ll go! Right. I borrowed a camera. My dad’s friend runs a studio. Wow! Then we can take pictures with the DJ? How should I pose? Like this? Or… Like this? Let’s try it. Ready? Come closer. So who’s this? My first love. I see. Then who’s this? He’s my husband. Oh, I see. I’d love to help you, but you know I can’t. The Privacy Act. You understand. Take care, then. Bye. Bye. What was that? See? You can’t just ask for someone and expect to find him. By the way, why’d you tell him you’re looking for your first love? He didn’t even ask. And why mention I’m your husband and make me look stupid? His dad’s friend! Is she really sick? Hello, sir. Check yourself in the mirror and sit over there. I didn’t come to have my picture taken. I’m looking for my first love. He’s not my husband. He’s just an acquaintance. The number is no longer in service… It doesn’t exist. Of course! It was years ago. Man! This woman looks like she had quite the temper. She’s my wife. She died. Is the number gone? Well, it’s been over 20 years. Can you recall anything else, sir? I’m not sure. All I remember is Busan! He worked at the shipyard here, then moved to the biggest one there. Busan? What! Try this. Eat it. Come on. Try it. Why? Want water? If I go to Busan Can I see you again? Your silky hair tossing in the wind You greeted me We blindly went up The Moonlight Hill Only the old sea Only the old memories As if time stood still Let’s keep holding hands Like we did then And stroll together Wait for me! My heels keep sinking in the sand. Why you! I told you not to wear those heels! I’ll break them off! Can’t you talk more nicely on our honeymoon? I gave up going abroad like others and came here. They’re out of their minds! During a national financial crisis, traveling abroad is wrong. What a great patriot. When they failed you for seven years on the high civil servant exam. Why bring that up now? I got a job, didn’t I? Wait! Slow down! What’s the rush? Casually I can’t wait! Troublemaker! Honey! I want raw fish! It’s my favorite! Not now. Later! - Your smile back then - Cutie-pie! The scent back then With our shadows on the faded sea We put together the pieces crushed By the waves If I go To Busan What’s with you? You bought sashimi? My favorite? I like raw fish too. What’s this? Pay for the room. Why can’t you do it? It’s embarrassing. Why? We’re married. Why would married couples come to a place like this? They’ll think we’re having an affair. I’ll go buy some alcohol. Text me the room number. Son! Did you have dinner? Yes. Took your vitamins too? Yes. I’m sorry I’m not there to take care of you. I’ll be back soon. Study hard and… Hello? Did he hang up? I’ll talk to you later. Bye! Damn screaming! What are they killing each other? What the heck? Damn it! Lying here like this brings back memories. Came to a place like this with him? What? Are you jealous? Who says I’m jealous! Like I was your first. Of course! We were innocent. Nothing like what you’re thinking. We? We! How can you say that! Don’t smile! Why did her appendix have to burst on a day like today? I know. Se-yeon. Yes? If you go to Bogildo Island in the south, there’s a pavilion built by YUN Seon-do. Though he was framed and exiled, he wrote many great poems there. I only saw it in pictures. I want to live there someday. Do you know what it’s called? What? Se-yeon Pavilion. It means pure, good and happy to be with. Like you. STARRY NIGHT RADIO SHOW Stop! We have tickets! The recording started. We came all the way from Mokpo! Can you let us in just once? Why didn’t you come earlier? I can’t. - Just once? - Can we stand in the corner? - Please! - It took us five hours! - Go! - How heartless! Golly, dang it! Seoul folks are dang cruel! Here. A Seoul ginkgo leaf for a souvenir. Then I’ll give you… A Seoul maple leaf. It’s for Hyung-jung! Ice cream, please That’s full of love Just two, please Share the love Close your eyes Feel the happiness now Let’s talk about love My beloved dear I want to hold you close forever I want to kiss your sweet lips My forever love You and I Like a bird to a flower You and I We are thrown in love You and I Straight to the heart My love, we are two Let’s talk about love My beloved dear I want to hold you close forever I want to kiss your sweet lips My forever love You and I Like a bird to a flower You and I We are thrown in love You and I Straight to the heart My love, we are two You’re looking for Mr. PARK Man-su? Yes. He was my manager. What’s this about? I went to school with his son. I need to find him. Do you know his number by chance? Mr. PARK’s son? What was his name? He was a tall and good-looking lad. Good-looking, my ass. His name is Jung-woo. Right! PARK Jung-woo. Jung-woo! He did well in school. He got a job at a TV station. Right! It was MBC in Cheongju. Our Jung-woo became an announcer! Hey! He’s not ‘our’ Jung-woo! Seoul, Mokpo, Busan, and Cheongju! What am I doing? Want me to drive? I have a license. The plastic card you keep in the closet? It’s useful for getting dirt out of fingernails. I told you to cut the small-talk with other moms and practice. I asked you to teach me, but you pretended not to hear. If couples practice driving together, they’ll get on bad terms. Like we’re on great terms now. If we’re still together, we’re good. There aren’t many cars around. See? I can drive! I’m good! Anyone can drive well at 30km/h. It must be hard for the soldiers. That’s nothing! Back in my days, we served for 30 months. We carried 40kg worth of gear in -20˚C weather wearing nothing but briefs. It’s nothing like that now. That’s nothing! When I fought in Vietnam, bombs dropped from above and exploded all around me. People went flying dead! Cut it out! Hey! Will you wait for him? That loser? You’re just like him. Damn it. Stop. Let’s go and give them some time. Come on. - Why didn’t you go earlier! - Stop! Why fail the high civil service exam for years and go so late! Come on! Let’s go! Newly enlisted soldiers! Please assemble in the court! Don’t make a sound Or our love may fly away Don’t move Or our love may grow weak Don’t speak Don’t wait for me! - Or our love will be heard - What the hell did you say, jerk? Don’t come near Or our love will drift away Left flank, march! Left flank, march! About-face, march! Right flank, march! Don’t say goodbye I am looking at you But tears continue to flow I can’t see you clearly Don’t wait for you? KANG Jin-bong! You bastard! You slept with me over 100 times! How can you say that? You know I can’t do anything without you! I’ll wait for you! Don’t think of breaking up! Don’t say goodbye We don’t know what parting is yet Don’t say goodbye We don’t know what parting is yet We don’t know What parting is yet Se-yeon! Seo-jin will have to serve soon, too. If he’s not disabled, he must go. Can’t you talk more nicely? For what? He’s our loving son! He loves music but you made him study for college exams! Burned all the songs he wrote. - You even broke his guitar! - Stop. You should be thankful he didn’t go astray and is good. It’s because you baby the kids, they’re so weak! Fine. Let’s see how well you raise them. But why? I’m not sure. Goodbye. Mr. Know-it-all got canned. This must be the end Now, I will go back I won’t fight against fate And trouble it no more Stop it! This must be the end He made many shows. ‘Mornings at Ulleungdo Island’, ‘Songs of Islands’, ‘Road to Namdo Island’, ‘Island-bound People’… The titles make me want to change the channel. Boring! Forget it! The station doesn’t even know. How can we find him? I found his Facebook! Korea is surrounded by three seas. With pebbles on the beach, it can’t be the west or east seas. Then it must be the south. There are over 2000 islands there. What? He’s crazy about islands, so he must live on one. He made all his programs on islands. Islands… Wait! If you go to Bogildo Island in the south, there’s a pavilion built by YUN Seon-do. I want to live there someday. I know where he is! It’s Bogildo Island! No! There’s no way! - Honey! - No! Bogildo Island, my ass! If we go there now, I can’t go to work tomorrow. Are you out of your mind? Then drop me off over there. Good. I wanted to meet him without you anyway. The second string is flat. - We gotta rehearse. Let’s go. - Coming. NO FERRY TODAY Jeez. Silly… See? I told you ships don’t sail at any time we want. The land ends here, so I thought it’d be over. But there’s an island out there. I wish life was like that too. When you think it’s over, I hope there’s an island out there. Here. Text me. Aren’t you curious? How I met him and why we broke up? I’m curious. It’s totally killing me. Let me ask one thing. You met me when you were 20. We were together for 30 years. But why him? Why miss him at a time like this? Did I treat you so bad… Well, I guess I did. But isn’t this going overboard? I feel bad. I’m so sorry to him. Aren’t you sorry to me? How could you! Eun-ju? The prettiest girl in grade 12? Yup. I can’t believe it. Me too, so I went and asked Eun-ju. Know what’s even more shocking? He cheated on Eun-ju and dumped her for someone else. He’s the worst flirt there is, don’t you think? I think heaven helped us to find out who Jung-woo really is. So let’s just forget about that jerk. Se-yeon. Se-yeon! Wait! If you call me one more time, I swear I’ll scream! Please take this? Eun-ju! Eun-ju! Wait up! KIM Hyun-jung! - What is it? - Come here! What’s with you? How could you? About what? Why’d you lie to me! Eun-ju doesn’t even know who Jung-woo is! I can’t explain it, but… You like him, don’t you? No way! Dang. It’s so obvious that you do! Se-yeon, let’s not do this. Right. Let’s not do this. Let’s not talk to each other ever again! I’m not your friend anymore! He moved away? Didn’t know? He left two weeks ago. Hurry! Run! Hurry up! Jeez. Why wear heels to a protest? No wonder you’re hurt. I didn’t come to protest. I just came here to buy a book. You’re not one of us? Jeez… You bastard! How can you cheat on me? I’m sorry. I deserve to die. Please… Wait! Not so hard. It hurts a lot. Please! Are you busy tomorrow? Why? How about a morning movie? You hit hard. Played volleyball? Once, twice I want to see you again and again I want to see your pretty smile again and again Anyone will want to see you again and again Is she single? I’m dying to know Everyone is in love I’m in love too Everyone is in love I’m in love too Once, twice I want to see you again and again I sneak glances at her again and again Everyone is in love I’m in love too Everyone is in love I’m in love too CHOI Won-bin rocks! I have something to say. The one I made this song for is here tonight. Sophia! Can you come up? Next up is ‘Alive’, making their comeback in two years! Ye-jin! Isn’t that your brother? Why’s he up there? Alive! Alive! Alive! Deep in your eyes All I couldn’t tell you Now, for once I’ll tell you Seo-jin! Seo-jin! This is everything that I gave him. They’re vitamins. What’s this? He’s receiving cancer treatment? Pardon? MY SON What a surprise! You’re calling me first? Hello? Son? Son? What is it? Is something wrong? Did Ye-jin cause trouble again? I warned her not to bother you. You said you’d return You said it’d only take a while You told me to wait right here Lies, lies, lies OH SE-YEON Mom! You don’t have cancer, do you? No way! You can’t die on me! Though the sun went down on me Though I crouched through the night You never came to me Lies Lies Only you I waited for endlessly What you said I believed foolishly WE LOVE YOU MOM & DAD! The road is frozen from the wind I am frozen still too Lies, lies, lies It was only a matter of time. They’re all grown up now. Hey! Hurry up! Wait up. I’m exhausted. And don’t call me ‘hey’. Can’t you call me by name? Hey! Hey! Hey! Who said to come this far? Wait. Hold on a second. What? Sorry. I thought no one was home. May I help you? - By chance is… - PARK Jung-woo. Is this his house? Yes. Who are you? His wife? He’s married! What a young, pretty wife he has! I’m his sister, Jung-ah. Nice to meet you. I used to be in the same club with Jung-woo. I heard he lived here. The broadcast club at Mokpo High? Yes, that’s right. I heard so much about you! Please, come in. Come in. Jung-woo passed away? How? He quit working at the TV station, then moved here to live. One day, his fishing boat sunk… Oh no. Why’d you come now? You’re too late. He always talked like folks in Seoul. But he’d talk with an accent in his sleep. It came out when he got mad we couldn’t see ‘Starry Night’. Hell! They cry and laugh! It’s like a variety show. I wrote the postcard for the tickets. He said he has to go there with someone he had a crush on. I guess that was you, sis. Since when is my wife your sis? What? Have some apples. I don’t eat apples in the morning. Wanna go to my room? No! Talk here. I know everything anyway. I know he was her first love. I’m open-minded, so just talk here. I don’t know if I should say this. Jung-woo missed you dang much. He kept it from us, but he tried hard to find you. After you dumped him, he got shocked and didn’t even date much. What a loser. Really? Dang right. He kept the picture you took together and a letter he wrote for you. Wait here. I’ll bring them out. Why bring them out? Jeez. What the heck? Why are you crying? How annoying! Here. Look. What? Who’s this? It’s not you! It’s not? Aren’t you Hyun-jung from Mokpo High? To Hyun-jung. I didn’t mean to startle you. I’m sorry. If I don’t tell you how I feel now, I feel like I’ll never get to. I really like you. I liked you for over ten years. I can’t believe it. But Se-yeon said you… This is insane. It can be anyone else but you. Can you tell me what you meant by it can be anyone else but me? I’ll wait outside the church at 7 p.m. tomorrow. You can come with Se-yeon like always. What first love? You had it all wrong for 30 years? How embarrassing! Holy cow. The apple is so good! So sweet! Then who are you? She’s OH Se-yeon. I’m KANG Jin-bong. Dang. See? Do you get it now? At least I lived with you. That was so embarrassing. You came all this way for that? Was that fool blind or something? Why that girl over you? Ask anyone! OH Se-yeon is 100 times better. I’ll go and tell him that. What? Go where? Where else? What? You’ll go and meet him there? Don’t you have pride? No! Don’t meet him! When I go and see you two together, you’re dead meat! I’m sorry to make you come this far. Are you okay? Aren’t you scared? Is there nothing we can do? Why didn’t I ask that? Actually… I’m not okay. I’m scared. And I couldn’t ask in case there is nothing we can do. I’m sorry to make you come this far. Quietly, you watch me Speechless, I stand You are so close to me But why must we part? The crescent moon floats in the sky The shadow falls on the river The world hasn’t changed But why must we part? Do me a favor? Now, I can never see again Your sad face When time goes by Dad said to break up. OH Se-yeon! I know you’re inside! I won’t take the civil exam! I’ll stop studying! So don’t break up with me! Marry me! Please! Can you live without me? I can’t! OH Se-yeon… But why must we part? Why must we part? Did you have a good trip? Yes. I’m sorry I had to miss work. It’s okay. It was nice and quiet here. Remember Mr. CHOI Man-seok? - Who? - He came and threw rice at you. Right. He registered his wife’s death yesterday. Really? That’s good. But he didn’t delay it for the reasons we thought. He said he couldn’t do it. If he did, it’d be admitting his wife is really dead. After a lifetime together, how could he end it with a piece of paper? Please file it. REPORT OF DEATH Is it our second wedding? Why do that a second time? Then what is it? A party. What? You complained that you never had a party on special days. Everything’s ready. Hyun-jung? Se-yeon! Oh my! Hyun-jung! Hyun-jung! How did you come here? I heard you lived in the States. I came by plane. It’s dang far. Jin-bong found me by radio. Radio? I'm looking for Mokpo Girls' Alumni Kim Hyun-jung who broke up 30 years ago… LA Korea? Write in Korean. A PARTY JUST FOR OH SE-YEON Oh my! It’s good to see you! How’ve you been? Mrs. LEE! Oh my! I can’t believe this! How’ve you been? Good. Thank you for taking the time to grace us with your presence. As I mentioned, my wife is not well. Still, while she is this beautiful, while she is healthier, when she can greet you all like this… Along with our loving family and dear friends, I prepared this day to thank and greet everyone. I wrote a letter for the first time. Hey! No, you asked me to call you, OH Se-yeon. Thank you for everything. For living a hard life after meeting me, I’m sorry. Thank you for living with me. The end. Next, the star of tonight! Let’s all welcome OH Se-yeon to the stage. Come on up, OH Se-yeon! OH Se-yeon! OH Se-yeon! After hearing the bad news, I wrote down ten things I wanted to do. Miraculously, they all came true. I went sailing on a ship. I traveled around the country, and even got to drive. Though I returned them, I bought expensive luxury goods. And I had a makeover done like this tonight. Thanks to my story on the radio, I met my dear friend Hyun-jung again. But what makes me the happiest is realizing how much I was loved. Thank you very much. Thanks to you, I had a great life. If you bump into Seo-jin or Ye-jin, please ask them if they are eating well and taking their vitamins. And… if they’re doing anything bad, scold them like your own kids, please. And… Last but not least, my husband, KANG Jin-bong… You were my first love after all. Don’t live alone. You can’t do anything by yourself. Meet someone nice. Don’t be lonely and live a long life, then come to me. Promise? Meeting you Touching your hair Meeting you Breathing with you Holding you and crying with you Oh, how fortunate That you, my beautiful world, is here I’m sorry. Let’s just have some fun! Seo-jin! Wait. Hold on! It’s cold out! Honey!
