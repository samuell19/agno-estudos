Actually, 8:30 would be better since you're our receptionist but it's now almost 9:40 and that makes me feel like you're just not committed to this office. - No, I am, and I'm sorry, and it won't happen again. - I mean, this isn't a one-off, it's a habit. - Well, I mean it this time, I do. - I hate having these conversations just as much as you do, but if things don't change, I'm gonna have to bring someone else up here. - Nine o'clock, got it. - Sweet. Good. (somber atmospheric music) (upbeat music) (man chuckles) - What's up, Toph? - Put these on. - Why? - Come on, put 'em on. Come on. - Alright. - You like sunshine, Felix? - Uh, yeah. - Good, because, and we're gonna make an announcement a little bit later but I wanted to float it to you early, the company is moving. - Oh, we're movin', what, to a bigger office with a sundeck? - (laughs) Nice. Cupertino, my man. - California? - Yeah, California, man! (laughs) - When, when, when did we? - Well, I mean, it's been in the works, but the whole idea is to have the team out there in about two and a half, three months. - Oh. - So, I mean, what do you think? You're down, right? - (chuckles) Um... - Look, look, I know you just started, but, we're all really excited about what you're gonna bring to the table and we hope you are, too. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah! - I'm in. - He's in? - Definitely. - Alright, man. - Yeah. - California. - California. - Hey. Alright, man, catch you later. (pensive music) (audience cheers and applauds) - Hey. - Oh, hey, Becca. - Oh, are you doodling something, can I see? - Oh, it's not really finished. - Oh, I get it, top-secret. You know, I used to draw when I was in high school. It must be so fun to have the time to do that kinda thing. - Mm-hm. - Any little shows coming up? That's too bad. I'm sure you'll get something. I'm gonna grab a latte, do you want anything? - No, I'm good. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Totes. - What about some nosh? - [Olympia] Thanks, no. (melancholic music) (upbeat music) - Hi, Olympia. - Hey, Susan. Hey, um, how's she doin' today? - Well, it looks like that clot's clearing up. But we're keepin' a close watch, even with the Heparin. - Did she eat today? - The nausea's been a lot for her lately. - Oh. When do you think she'll be strong enough to start chemo again? - Doctors are keeping a close watch on her blood work. We're gonna have to wait and see. (somber atmospheric music) - Are you asleep? - Not anymore. (Olympia chuckles) - I'm sorry. - It's okay. What time is it? - Six, maybe? - Aren't you supposed to be goin' to dinner at Grace's tonight? - Yeah. - You should go. - I will. (audience cheers and applauds) (upbeat music) (chuckles) - Hey! - Hello! - [Grace] What if you wanna have a baby or buy a house? I mean, I know that wasn't always your style, God knows. - Just because he has this job now doesn't mean, he has debts, he has, why are we talking about babies and houses? - Because, I mean, 30's not old and all, but... - Oh, my God. - Okay, fine. (thuds and clunks) (moody electronic music) - Watch right. - Yeah. - Watch the left. - I know things are hard. Right now, even my friends with useful degrees... - As opposed to my shitty, impractical art degree? - I mean degrees where you get a job and you make money. Like money-money and you get vacation and you get benefits. Even they are having a hard time sometimes. And you haven't been talking a lot. About Mom or Dad. - Fuck Dad, though. - Geez, Olympia. - It's been a year, do you think he's found himself yet? When's the last time you talked to him? Did he say when he's coming back? - Okay, alright. (moody electronic music) - Whoa, whoa, whoa! I thought you were playing in your room! - I ate part of the rug. - You ate part of the... Why did you do that? - He probably just needs to ease into the job. I hope he's over the recording studio. Probably wasn't the smartest move and losin' all that money, I can't even imagine... - Grace? - [Grace] I'm just trying to say that he's great. - Don't. - Don't what? - Do what you're doin' right now. - And what am I doing right now? You're impossible, I'm just trying to, I'm just wondering what's next, you know. - Why does something always have to be next? - Because, Olympia, that's the way life works, you just... - Need help with anything? - No, we're just about done. Actually, can you open up that wine on the table? I don't even know how to talk to you sometimes. What part of the rug did he eat exactly? - I don't know, I didn't ask him. - It was probably just the fringey stuff on the side. - Yeah, probably the fringey stuff, he'll be fine. - What if it was the bottom part, that's the scratchy part, it could be scratching up his insides. - (laughs) Not scratching up his insides. - How could he have gotten at the bottom part? He has baby teeth, for God's sake. Felix, how's the new job going? Development, right? - Yeah, yeah. - What's the name of that new app? Harry, Harry. - Carey? - Harry. - Harry, Carey. Harry Carey, Hare Krishna. - No, no. The app is called Henrietta. - Henrietta. - And it's goin' pretty good, yeah. We got some exciting new developments. - Like what? - I mean, they're, um, still... - In development. Developments in development. - I guess so, yeah. - Mm-hm. - Why so secretive? - Let the man, hey. Cheers to your exciting new developments, whatever they may be, cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. There we go. (peaceful music) (fireworks whistle and crackle) - So, "exciting new developments?" - Company's moving. - Henrietta's moving? - Yep. - To a bigger office? - To California. And, uh, I would like to know if you, Olympia Welles, will like to come with me, to California. - Oh, wow. - I know, I know. - Is it decided, are you going, you definitely have to go? - Think so. Kinda gotta make this job work. - Right. - And I've been thinkin' about it, Lym, not just today. We could get married. - What? Don't do that, what're you doing, don't do that. - Right, no. No. Look, I know you never thought about yourself as a relationship kind of person. - I never said that. I just said we should be able to walk away whenever we want. - And I'm happy that every day for the past three years neither one of us has. And now, I know your family. I know how you like your eggs, you know where I'm ticklish. I know where all your beauty marks are. We could build something, if you wanted to. You want to? - I... - Guys. Dessert. - What do you wanna bet Grace made that ice cream by hand? - I wouldn't take that bet. - Let's talk about it later, okay? - Okay. - Oh, my God. Was ice cream always this good? Mm-mm, that's mine. (moody hop-hop music) - I'm just gonna... - [Man] My lovely goddess. - Oh, hey. - Felix! May I present to you, my smart and charming lady friend, Shane. Smart and charming lady friend Shane, may I present to you, my roommate Felix. - Felix! - I'm Felix. - Oh, Damn the Man Dan was just showing me your guys' place. - And our couch. - We're going to a reading, if you wanna come. - Shane's reading some of her poetry, she's so good. - You are. - Olympia. My love! Did you draw me anything today? - No, I'm sorry, Damn the Man Dan. (Dan groans) - I forgive you. Hey. How's Angie? - Still in the hospital. - Tell her I live for her. - I will. - Okay. DMD, over and out. Let's go, boo. - Bye. - Hey, I think I'm gonna stay at my place tonight actually. - You sure? - Yeah, I think I just wanna chill. - Okay. Yeah. Is everything okay? - Yeah! - Do you want a ride? - It's nice out, I'll walk. (upbeat music) - Remember that interview I had with that... - [Both] "Hip but ironic online journal." - Yeah. So, guess what? They want me to come in for a second interview, in person. - Oh, I thought... - I know, I thought the same thing. I just assumed, I don't know, I was just too fabulous for them. That they couldn't handle all of this. - Do you think you'd take it, all the way to New York? - Yeah. Do you know how hard it is to get someone to pay you to write for them? I mean an actual, sufficient amount of US dollars. Not just a handshake and a Starbucks gift card. - Yeah. Yeah. Can you believe we've never lived more than 10 minutes away from each other our whole lives? - Hey, I might not even get it. - When's the interview? - Couple of days. They're flyin' me in and out, it's real fast. - God, we're almost 30. (friend chuckles) - You're not 30 until next week. - Yeah, but there's gotta be a cutoff point for getting your life together. Like, in your 20s, you can be as much of an adult as you wanna be, but in your 30s, if your life is still a mess, then you're probably just a standard fuck-up. - You're not a standard fuck-up. If you're a fuck-up, you're a unique snowflake of a fuck-up. (both laugh) - [Olympia] Can you call my student loan office and tell them I'm a unique snowflake fuck-up? (friend laughs) - Yeah, what's their number? - I don't think I'm gonna be what I thought I was gonna be. - Of course you are. You're an artist. - I'm not selling anything, I'm not even up in a cafe. And I got rejected from Nouveau. - Oh, shit. What's the definition of modern art? - I don't know, what? - It's when someone says to you "hey, I could've done that," and you say, "yeah, but you didn't." I know that you are not even checking your phone right now while we're having a conversation. You're being totally rude. - Oh, my God. It's Nouveau. - Shut up, what'd they say? - "Dear Miss Welles, we've had one of our artists "drop out unexpectedly, if you'd still like your work "to be a part of the show..." (jazzy piano music) (background chatter) (cameras snap) This is a terrible idea, why am I here? - Relax, drink the wine. (phone rings) (phone rings) I have to take this, I'll be right back. Talk to her. - Hi. Hello. - Hi. - I'm Olympia. - You're the artist? - That's, yes, I'm the, uh, artist. - It's interesting, simple. - I know, it's simplistic. - Simple, not simplistic. Have some confidence. - Are you an artist? - I'm an artistic entrepreneur. I'm working on a zine, prose, illustrations, varying themes. - That's sounds really interesting, I'd love to, I guess, hear more as it develops. - You guess you'd love to hear more? - I'd like to hear more, yes. Do you have a card? - Think I have a few left. Here. This has some potential, I think. - What do you know about zines? - Oh, zines? Zines are great. - Yeah, but like... - What? (TV audience laughs) - Hey, that was a marathon. - Why are you here? Why are you not at some after party with your friends? - 'Cause I wanna be here. Jemma got a really good job in New York, and Felix's job is moving to California, and Felix asked me to go with him. - And are you gonna go? - I don't know. - Well, why wouldn't you go? - Because. To be here with you. - Why would you wanna be here with me instead of out there, doin' things? Oh, I wish I'd done more, you know? Well, I guess you don't. You can't know until you've had the distinct feeling of something important having passed you by. A feeling you don't have, (somber atmospheric music) until the thing that passed you is long, long gone. - Mom. - No. Back when I was still tryin' to be an actress... (audience cheers and applauds) Everything shone. Everything was possible. Your father was gonna play his music, and I was gonna be on the marques. - Mom. - Olympia. You're gonna have regrets. No matter what. So, you might as well regret the things you did do, rather than end up regretting the things you didn't. 'Cause then at least you'll know, okay? I ever tell you why I named you Olympia? - To provide focus and intention for my middle school bullies? - I think I wanted you to have a name that was... How would you say it? Epic. - [Olympia] When do you have to move? - [Jemma] Brace yourself. Two weeks. - That's soon. - I know. I keep thinking, though, that I'm gonna get there and, and there's gonna be like some secret handshake that you have to know in order for people to not be rude to you. I hear that's an issue. - You should just use our old handshake, remember that? - Are you kidding me? (both laugh) - I'm really happy for you. I am. - I know. So, is Felix gonna take you out on the town tonight? - Oh, he has a work thing. - Oh. Well, why don't you just come over my place after work? I gotta pack, you can have dibs on whatever I don't take. - Yeah, okay. Oh, shit, I gotta get back, I'm late. - Oh. (pensive music) - (chuckles) I don't think that'll be a problem. Oh, I know. Two o'clock is the worst. (Scott sighs) (upbeat music) - When was this? - Oh, Felix took that. Remember, that was the night you guys met. I took that one. Look how he's lookin' at you. (peaceful guitar music) (background chatter) (audience applauds) - Thanks, thanks, everybody. (soft rock music) Hey, can I join you? - My friend is sitting there. - Can I keep her seat warm at least? - How do you know it's a her? - Happy to keep his seat warm, too. - Okay. Is it safe to take a drink from a stranger these days? - [Felix] I hope so. - Just so you know, my friend'll be back in a minute, so, if anything goes down, she'll definitely kick your ass. - Thanks for the heads-up. - I'm just saying, it could turn out badly for you. - So it should. Oh, hey, that's me. - Oh, yeah. - I like it. You draw? - Kind of. - Hi. - Oh, um, Jemma, this is... - Felix. - Jemma. - Olympia, I'm... - (chuckles) Jemma, what're you drinkin'? - One of those. - Cool, be right back. - Can I keep these? - [Jemma] Just steal all my memories, why don't ya. (phone rings) - Hey. - [Felix] Hey, I got done early, wanna come over? Shh, shh, shh, she's coming, she's coming. - [Woman] Be quiet, be quiet. - [Olympia] It's dark in here. Felix? - Surprise!

(somber atmospheric music) - [Scott] Olympia, it's Scott, it's 9:20, we're wondering if you're planning on coming into work today. Hi, Scott again, we hope everything's okay. Still waiting for you at work. Look, it's pretty clear that you don't value or respect this job, so if we don't hear from you by the end of the day, we're gonna have to figure out something else on a permanent basis. - Hi, Scott, it's Olympia. I know I missed work today and I didn't call. I'm really, really sorry, it's just that my... Look, I do respect this job. I know I fucked up, but I will make it up to you. I'll be in bright and early tomorrow, okay? Thanks, thanks, Scott. - Good morning, I'm Jen, can I help you? - Who are you? - Oh, I'm Jen. - No, no, but who are you? - Jen, from the staffing agency? - No, no, no, I work here. - It's your first day, too? - Olympia, I'm sorry, I need you to go. - Scott. - Olympia, just... - No, no, really, really. - Hey, hey, hey. Let's not make a scene about this. I've given you plenty of second chances, and now I need you to leave. - [Toph] Pretty sweet, huh? - Yeah. (Toph chuckles) - Hey, listen. Timeline has moved up a bit and we would love-slash-need you out there in about three weeks instead of a couple months. Now, look, I know, I know, but just think about it, okay? Take some time. Yeah? - Yeah. - Cool, man. Hey, Chad, I'll be right back, hey, Chad. You've gotta delete that picture off your phone, man. (somber atmospheric music) - Hey. - If my mother was here, she'd say, "Hay is for horses." - How long you been here? - Hard to say. - Are you okay? - Can I sleep here tonight? - Yeah. - And can we not really talk about anything, and watch a movie that doesn't require a lot of thinking and eat food that has, like, no nutritional value whatsoever? Can we do that? (peaceful guitar music) Thanks for walking me home. - Yeah, sure. - Goodnight. (chuckles) - Hey! - I'm off one-night-stands for the time being, so... - No, I was actually gonna ask if I could take you to dinner. That's what I wanted. Sometime? - So, like a date? - Yeah, like a date. - I don't know. - How can I get you to know? - I'm not sure. (Felix chuckles) - Well, at least, if I'm not gonna see you again, for the rest of my life. At least let me, um...

(Olympia chuckles) (peaceful piano music) - Anyone who knew my mother-in-law knew how funny she was, and how she had a smile, and a laugh that could fill an entire room. The truth is, the time we have with each other is short, and whether it's 15 minutes or 50 years, we don't know. So we really have to hold everybody close. And when we have someone who comes into our lives and touches our lives, and changes our lives, that's somethin' to celebrate. Sometimes people come into our lives like lightning, and turn the whole thing upside-down and wake us up and then they're gone. Others come into our lives and they change us slowly, so slow that we don't even realize we're changing. And there will always, always come a time, when we have to let go of someone. No one stays in our lives forever and Angie knew that. But what we can't hold in our arms, we can hold within ourselves, because that person, even if they're gone, has already changed us and they're with us forever. And I think Angie would want us to be happy about that. ♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪ ♪ Awake unto me ♪ - Is that it? - That's it.

Why, have you never paid... - No, yeah, I've paid bills. - Are you one of those trust fund people? No judgment, that's great, that's great. - I wish I was, why, are you? - Dad gambled a little too much for that. - Oh. - Oh, that's probably, sorry. - No, it's fine. - No, I... I'm not really great at this, um, I'm divorced. Recently divorced, so, still tryin' to re-figure out the whole, uh... - It's not like riding a bike. (Nathan chuckles) - Nope. Definitely not. I'd like to leave here, with you. - And go where? - My place. We could go to my place. - Oh, right. - I know what you said earlier, I'm not tryin' to sound... Life is short. - There we go. Ta-da! - How long have you lived here? - A few years. I'm gonna get some water, do you want some? - Do you have anything stronger? - [Olympia] Right, yeah. - [Nathan] Who's this? - [Olympia] It's my parents. - Your mom's really beautiful. Does she live here? - Why, do you want her number? (Nathan chuckles) - [Olympia] My mom died. - Shit. How long ago? - Like a week ago. - Shit. Sorry. - It's just one of those things. Cheers. Is that your brother? - No. - Are you married? - No. Not married. - Okay. Okay. (Olympia moans) (phone rings) Um, hang on, my phone. (phone rings) My phone, um... - Ignore it. - I should, um... - Ignore it. (phone rings) - [Olympia] I think... (retches and coughs) (toilet flushes) - [Nathan] So, I'm just gonna, um... I'm gonna go now. (somber atmospheric music) (sighs) - [Phone] You have one unheard message. - [Felix] Hey. I'm sorry about how that went, just, call me back, okay? (phone chimes) - [Father] Olympia. Daughter. A lot has happened since the last time I saw you. Since I've been gone, I've wondered all the time how you and your sister are and how much Hunter has grown. Grace sent me a message saying your mother died. I know you resent me for being away, and I know you might never forgive... - Fuck you! Fuck you, Dad, do you hear me, wherever the fuck you are. Fuck you, I hate you! (background chatter) (upbeat guitar music) (upbeat music) (intercom buzzes) - [Woman] Can I help you? - It's Olympia Welles. (door buzzes) - Come on in. - [Olympia] Thanks for making time to see me. Especially on such short notice. - Well, I don't really have a lot of time, so have a seat. (suspenseful music) Remind me what you wanna talk about? - Well... - I hope you don't mind if I take care of a few emails while we talk. - Sure. - So, how can I help you? - I, well... I looked you up and I know the zine is a small operation. - Yes, by design. - Yes. But I think I can contribute in a strong way. - [Entrepreneur] In what capacity? - In regards to illustrations? - We have an illustrations editor, but you're welcome to submit your work to be considered for a forthcoming edition. - Okay. Could I... Could I show you something? - What is it? - This is something I always wanted to do and I always imagined it hard-cover and bound like some big, substantial, real thing, but then I looked at what I had and I thought, why not just do it myself? - This is pretty good. Okay. Tell me about your vision. - I guess there's what I see and what I imagine, and I think I try to draw the place where those two things collide. I like to draw people. I like to draw them how they are but also how they might be. Essentially. Like, everything's always changing, obviously. And fading. But sometimes along the way there's this tiny, tiny moment that's just... Everything. (upbeat music) (peaceful music) (phone rings) - [Felix] Felix, you missed me, but why are you even callin' me? You should be textin' me. (knocks) - What're you doing here? - I can't do it. It's overwhelming. It's demanding, it's never not demanding. Like, every moment. And the secret handshake does not work. - Right. - And I really, really, really, really, really, really didn't know it would be like this. I mean, nobody told me. Seriously. - So, today you just got on a plane? - [Jemma] Yeah. - I think you just got scared. (Jemma chuckles) - I did. - Yeah. But you're also like the bravest person I know. - Yeah? - Yeah. And tomorrow you should get on another plane and go back. - Won't you miss me? (chuckles) - Yeah, I will. - I don't know, I just kept thinkin' in New York, I wish I had just stay put, you know, like you. It would've been so much easier.

Moving, you have to pack. - Right. What's Damn the Man Dan planning to do? - He says he and Shane are gonna go down state and live and work on an ethical farm for a while, and write poetry, and milk cows. Look, we can we not do this? - Do what? - The whole part of the conversation where we dance around what we're really here to talk about and try to surmise. Don't wanna do it. - Yeah, we can skip that. - So... What? - I... I got a job. - Different one? - I lost the last one, I got fired. - When? - After my mom died. - Why wouldn't you tell me somethin' like that? - I don't know. - You, you keep doin' this, Lym. Like, you don't let people in on things, you don't let me help, it's like you wanna push everybody as far away from you as you can. - So, anyway, I got offered this job at a new zine as an assistant illustrations editor. - Congratulations. Look, I gotta pack. - Can I help. - Fuck you, Olympia, okay? If this is what's gonna happen, if I tell you I have to move, come with me, and the first thing you do is go find a job that's gonna keep you from coming even if you... - It won't. - What won't? - The job. It's mainly web, I'd have to travel some, but... So, I'm thinking... I'm thinking I'll move to California. - [Felix] You wanna come to California? - Yes. I don't wanna get married, it's just not something I want. I was scared before. But the last couple of days, I don't feel so scared. - Just like that, huh? Now that you're not scared anymore, everything's supposed to be fine. - I don't know what I'm supposed to say right now. I'm sorry I called you a quitter. - I did quit. I did. Look. I found a studio apartment out there today and, uh, I think I'm gonna take it. - I'm telling you I wanna come with you. - And what happens if you get scared again? What am I supposed to do if you leave? - I don't know, just let me go. And let me be alone and figure it out. - And what if you don't come back? - What? - What if you don't come back? Can't do it, can you? Just say you'll come back. Can you leave now? (gentle blues music) (books clatter) - Felix?
