DEATH ROW CONVICT ESCAPES FROM PRISON WITH AID OF FELLOW INMATE CRIMINALS HIDING IN TOKYO? NO TRACE OF THE CRIMINALS A WEEK HAS PASSED SINCE THE ESCAPE THE THREAT DIRECTED BY KINJI FUKASAKU Nukii has been a member of our firm for 6 years. I… Although I’m unworthy, I'm the head of our sales department. He has worked hard as my right-hand man. And he has become an indispensable asset in our sales department. The bride, Noriko Mukai, in 1960, graduated from Shirakiku Women's College, a famous mission school. After graduation, she was soon employed at Kyohoudou with outstanding grades. She worked in the secretarial section of the General Affairs Department until now. During this period, she was the senior managing director's eyes, ears, hands, and feet. I believe her achievements in fulfilling the important responsibilities of a core department of the company deserve special mention today. Misawa's in a difficult position. Matchmaker between a subordinate and the senior managing director's lover. But now he might also be remembered by the senior managing director. It might not be too unpleasant. This must have been in his calculations too. But... Hyping up the groom as an indispensable asset in the sales department? Misawa's too good at talking. But it's like marrying off a bride for a senior managing director. It's tricky business. Maybe in time he'll overtake his superior? Anyway, that was too much of an introduction. "The senior managing director's eyes, ears, hands, and feet"? She contributed in other places too. Hey, that's mean! Dad, where are you going? You wait here. Sir, thank you for coming. No need to thank me. It seems like a great event. Yes, thanks to you. This way, please. Director... For the bride from the senior managing director. Please be careful not to be misunderstood. Got it. MUKAI FAMILY NUKII FAMILY It's finally over. Yeah. The bride is beautiful. The groom looks sophisticated. Those two are a perfect couple! --in the East Strait-- The wedding was so grand it made me nervous, though. We're not home yet? We're almost there. No, no. Masao. - Change your clothes first. - Uh-huh. Why did you come in wearing slippers again? Come here! Did you fill the bathtub? I will. Just a moment. Here, do it yourself. ...20, 21, 22, 23, 24-- What's going on? Mom! Masao, hurry up and get dressed. Keep it open. Keep the door open. Darling. You're quite old, but you still say "darling"? Move faster! A piece of glass and you're scared? You're a big man with a weak heart. What do you want? Money? Do you have enough money here to satisfy us? How much do you want? Don't try too hard. You seem to have good living. I bet you're paying for everything in monthly installments. That's how it is for office workers nowadays. Ma'am, at least give me some tea. - How much do you want?! - Shh! What do we want? The first thing's food. Then we need to borrow your car. Ours happened to break down near here. And then the house. The house? A place for us to sleep. And then this guy's caretaker. That's you, Mom. Darling... Why did you choose our family? It's like winning the lottery, right? Does that mean you're going to stay? Are you going to refuse? Huh?! How-- How long will you stay? Until tomorrow night. You can't refuse. Who the hell are you people? Don't you even read the newspaper? Sabu. DEATH ROW CONVICT KAWANISHI UNABLE TO BE TRACED ALREADY A WEEK SINCE THE ESCAPE, HE MAY HAVE FLED ABROAD We can stay the night, right? I've already told you about myself. This baby? Sabu. While you're over there, tell them. Here. THE SECRET OF LONGEVITY PLAYING WITH GRANDCHILDREN CANCER AUTHORITY DR. SAKATA & LITTLE KENJI Kidnapping! Kidnapping! Kids are smarter than adults these days. Hey, kid. You watch a lot of TV, don't you? That's right. That's about it. Get your car. Get your car. Son! - No! Stop! - Son of a bitch! Stop it! Darling! You son of a bitch! Sabu! Kid. It's real. I'm sorry. Please don't. Now that you know what's up, hand over the car already. Your wife will stay and cook food. Just get moving! Mom. Do you think Dad can beat that guy so there's only one other guy left? - Masao! - Ma'am. You have bad manners. This kid watches too much TV, doesn't he? Masao, don't say things like that. Kids just have to behave, okay? Hey! Stop the car! Get out! Untie the rope. What's taking so long? Do it already! Come on! Back up. Straight backwards. Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! What is this? Isn't this a bowl lid? I'm not a dog. Hey! Aren't there any bowls for guests?! - How am I supposed to eat from a lid? - Sabu. She's a good housekeeper. Her husband's really lucky. Bastard. What's that look for? You're touching other people's things. Shut up! If you have a complaint, speak up! - Sabu. - What? Don't do anything petty. We still need his cooperation. Mister. Let's go for a drive again after dinner. We'll go a little further this time. This car's on an installment plan too? There's still a lot left. But it's a pretty good car. Not too shaky either. How's the fuel consumption? - 12 to 13 kilometers per liter. - Right. Oh! Turn right here. You're a good driver, too. How long have you been driving? I learned it in the army. You were in the army, too? - Where did you fight in the war? - In the south. For about a year. Ever killed anyone? No. That seems right. Probably never raped a woman, either. You had no problem doing it, right? Huh? It's good for both of us that you understand it that way. But then again… You've got one heck of a disaster on your hands, eh? What would a soldier who's never killed anyone do in this situation? Are you gonna turn a blind eye and put up with it? Huh? Not bad. I get along with people like you. Oh! Turn left there. So where did Dad go? Yeah! That's it! That's it! That's it! One more punch! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! Come on, one more! One more punch! That's it! That's it! Whoa, yeah, yeah! That's it! This guy's really loud! Ma'am, you take this kid! I can't stand it! Oh! Well done! Turn right there. Stop! Back up. A little further. A little further. It's a little further. Stop! SAKATA GENERAL HOSPITAL There's one more thing I need you to do. Make a phone call. Just say what's written here. A nice voice like mine is easily recognizable. Hello, this is Sakata residence. Is that for me? Hello, this is Sakata. Uh, hello, is this Dr. Sakata? Are you really Dr. Sakata? Uh, I'm… I have your grandson. Yes, that should be fine. Can you please bring the ransom? Now? Huh? 200,000 yen? That's okay. Tonight at 8:30. Can you go to the mailbox across from the elementary school just by yourself? We'll find a way to return the child to you. Oh, and don't contact the police-- Okay, take a shortcut this way. Go. There he is. Okay, start the car. Oh, wait. When you pass that pathetic doctor, remember the guy's face. Go. Turn right there. Turn left ahead and go in. Take a good look at that face again. Do as I say. Go. Turn left here. Stop. It looks like the cops weren't contacted. Did you remember his face? Okay. Let's go back. What's that look on your face for? You think I'm going to stop at 200,000 or 300,000 yen? Okay, your wife's waiting at home. Let's go. Masao. Masao. I won't tell your husband. He'll never know. Don't! Be quiet! Do you want your kid to watch? Don't! It's okay. He won't notice. What's with that look on your face? What did you do? Nothing. Hiroko! Darling. Darling! There's no need to be angry. Nothing happened between us! Sabu! We're not here to play. Dumbass. I know. Hiroko. No matter what, there's no escape. Bring the ashtray over here. Bro. What are you doing? Shut up. Keep you mouth shut. Are you still angry about what just happened? I ain't got that kind of time. I'm thinking. About what? About tomorrow. About the ransom? Yeah. I decided to have him do it. You gotta be kidding me. That's too risky. And it's not risky if we do it? My face and yours are quite well-known. But even so, if he's the only one-- I'm in charge of everything. From this house. From this house? Yeah, by phone. Using the "remote control", the newest fad. A remote control? As long as we hold on to his wife and kid, he has to keep going on the track we've set. Like a robot. It's a role that suits him well. Hiroko. Are you still sulking? I… I didn't expect you to beat me. Hiroko. We'll be heard! You were kissed by that man again like this, weren't you? No way! Be quiet. Don't. At a time like this? Stop! - I'm not stopping! - Bastard! Just thinking about that guy makes me-- You're so stupid! Stop it! Darling! Stop it! Darling! Darling! Bro. What's going on? He's just the kind of man I thought he was after all. What? He'll just bear and swallow it all. Perfect. Tomorrow will definitely go well. Yeah, hello. Connect me to Niigata 234059. Yeah. It's Kawanishi. How's the boat? Three o' clock? Tomorrow morning at three o'clock? Okay, got it. By the way, if anything comes up, you can call Tokyo here at 4-- Ready? 416…1256. It's 6:00. Call me. What the hell? So you're up. Why shouldn't I be? Isn't that a little cold? What? How come I didn't know about the boat in Niigata? It's just been decided. It didn't sound like that. That's enough! I'll give you your share, like I promised. You shouldn't have anything to complain about. Maybe not before. But now it's different. What? Only you will escape safely and I'll be left behind?! You gotta take care of me! Sabu! Keep your voice down! If you want, I'll take you with me. But you're responsible for the cost of the boat. Nothing was reported about us. Looks like today will go well, right? How long would it take to get to Niigata in that guy's car? If we race through the night, maybe seven hours. Plus two hours to spare. To be there at 3:00 tomorrow morning, we have to leave here by 6:00 at the latest. Once he gets the money. What about that? What do we do with them? We can't just leave them here. What if the police surround us? I know. There aren't a lot of options. It's up to him. Hello? Yes, it's me. What's going on? I waited there for three hours last night. I'm sorry. Uh... There were some difficulties on my end. The baby? Hello?! Please, we'll do anything! Please give us back our child! Please give us the child! Hello? Please let me talk to Mr. Sakata again. Please let me talk to him again. Hello? Is this Mr. Sakata? Uh... Please prepare a ransom of 10 million yen. What? 10 million? Yes. 10 million. And… If you care about the baby, make sure you bring it. I'll call back later to tell you the location of the transaction. And… Please don't contact the police. Hello? Such a huge amount is too-- Hello?! Hello?! Mr. Misawa. You're getting better at it! The real challenge is yet to come. Ma'am. Don't cry and drag your husband down. Don't treat me like a fool! What's wrong with you, you arrogant bastard? You mock my husband! Do you really think that human life is so worthless? Hiroko... Hiroko... Enough. If you cry like that, Masao will be sad. Please hold it back... You should watch your words in the future. It'll be too late to change things after you've been hurt. You have a very important job today. I'll talk to you later. Go ahead and leave. Don't worry. Oh, leave the car behind. Lack of sleep is a recipe for an accident. Oh, ma'am. Call the kid's school when it's over. Get him permission to be absent. Aren't you glad? No way! Coward! Masao! NEW STRATEGY FOR THE INFIELD KYOKODO SALES DEPARTMENT THE FIVE "HOWS" FOR LANDLORDS Good morning, sir! Thank you for your hard work! Change the ashtray. SALES DIRECTOR It's okay. SALES DIRECTOR There is still no trace of the kidnapper Akira Kawanishi and his accomplice Saburo Nakayama. This kid is noisy! Quiet! The alert has been raised to expand the search to the whole country. Next up is the weather. First, the national weather… Damn, the kid's noisy! I'm gonna kill-- It's normal for babies to cry! How can he understand what adults say? Sabu! Excuse me. - What is it? - Oh... Actually, a stolen vehicle was found in the woods nearby. Did you notice anything suspicious between last night and this morning? I'm not sure. Uh, I didn't notice anything. Oh. Oh, I see. By the way, you have a car at home, right? Is it your husband's? Yes. Oh, I see. So, he didn't go to work today, did he? Ah, right, something came up today. Oh! Oh, I see! Then I'll take my leave. Masao! What's wrong! Heh-heh. It's tough having a naughty son. Then I'll leave you now. Masao! Masao! You brat! He's really something. Hello. Central Police Station? Director. You have a call from an outside line. Yes, this is Misawa. Hello? Hello?! Please connect me. Yeah, it's me. It's not a good idea to talk there. Go outside and call me from a phone booth. Your husband's happily working. Yeah, it's me. And now for your next instruction. Don't get the order wrong. The handoff will happen on the roof of the Teiou Department Store. You know where, right? It's set for 12 o'clock. Call Sakata from there. You remember what he looks like, right? Yeah, right there. Sorry to interrupt. I have a favor to ask of you. You see the children's train boarding area over there? Know where I mean? Yeah. And then… The cafeteria ticket booth. - Huh? - Yeah. It's where cafeteria tickets are sold. At 12:15, could you please slowly walk over there? Uh-huh. I can give you five thousand if you do it. Okay! - Okay? - Yeah! 12:15. Fifteen minutes? Hello? Is this Teiou Department Store? An acquaintance of mine named Mr. Sakata should be on the rooftop. Can you please call him? Yes, Sakata. Mr. Sakata, Mr. Sakata. Your acquaintance is calling you. If you are there, please come to the phone booth in the the furniture department on the sixth floor. I'm Sakata. Do you have a call for me? Yes, this way please. Hello? Is this Mr. Sakata? At 12:15, a middle-aged man in a raincoat will walk slowly from the children's train boarding area to the canteen ticket booth on the roof. Please give the ransom money to this man. Understand? You. Stop! Stop! Let me use this! Hello? Hello?! Okay, understood. What?! It went badly? What the hell is going on? Hey! Hey! Explain! Clearly! Huh? The cops were there? Oh. Asshole! Whatever! Hey. Come back to the house. Are you listening, asshole? Get your ass back here! Yes, I'll-- I'll be back. But please wait a little longer! I'll be back! I swear! Hey! Hey! Damn it! He hung up on me! Bro, were the cops really waiting for him? Who else could it be?! - Hey, watch your tone... - Shut up! What the fuck! What do we do with them? What if the cops surround us? I know. There aren't many options. It's up to him. What's going on? Is something wrong? No. Where is everybody? They're all home. It's Saturday. What is it? What's going on? Hold on a second. Hello, this is the Gochome police box. Yes. Yes. Okay, got it. Hello? Darling! You're all safe, right? Masao too? Huh? Are you all alright? Hey! What are you dawdling about? Oh...uh...money. I'm trying to raise some money. Dumbass! You think you can do it alone? Get your ass back here! What? Two more hours? You son of a bitch! Hey! Hello? Damn it! He hung up again! That bastard! Get your asses back in the room, damn it! Bro, get it over with. Don't mess around! Bro! We can't take the boat if we go empty-handed. But we can't just sit here and wait, bro! Don't touch me! Bye, then! See, I told you! What? That's why I was against letting him go solo from the start! What about the remote control? What about the robot? That's what happens when you're cocky! Anyway, bro, you're a double-talker. You said that if I cooperated, I'd get two million. But then you told me you still had to get the money and you asked me to help. I figured we were already in the same boat, so I'd go along with it. And then this happened. What about my share?! I see, bro. I got it. I'll go alone. You take care of the cleanup! Wait. Bro! This business is not over yet. If you're determined to go, then you start the cleanup. Got it? If you got it, then sit down. You can get rid of them anytime. We have to wait patiently. Right? We wait until the last moment. Mom. Dad's coming back, right? He's not going to run away somewhere else, right? Silly boy. Of course he'll come back. Hey, what's wrong? He's in a good mood! The local train to Kuroi will depart from platform 8 at 18:56. Passengers are requested to go to the platform as soon as possible. The four cars at the back are headed for Kuroi. The first six cars are headed for Kumane. Please board the train promptly and check the final destination. The local train to Kuroi will depart from platform 8 at 18:56. Please be careful and wait behind the white line on the platform. Bro. Are we finally gonna do it? Why? Because… You're drinking even though you can't drink. Dad! Where have you been hanging out? Hurry inside. You! Where the hell have you been? Hey, where's the money? - Masao. - Did you get it? Just put him to bed. You bastard! I'm asking where the money is! - Hiroko. - Did you get it? Hiroko, hurry and put Masao to bed. Don't let Masao see this! Don't fuck with me, asshole! Damn it! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! You son of a bitch! Where's the money? Damn it! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Get up! Get the fuck up! Don't fuck with me! Damn it! Yeah, it's me. What? Good. Got it. Sabu. It was from Niigata. The ship's departure is postponed a day. This gives us another day to negotiate with Sakata. Mr. Misawa. You won't get much sleep. Get some rest. Hey. He's waiting at the teahouse over there. There's a red phone booth in front of the store. - Hey, are you listening? - I'm listening. Dad... Use this. Calm down and be careful. If you screw up again… Hello. There's a Mr. Sakata in your store. Could you please call him? Is Mr. Sakata there? I have a call for you. Hello, this is Sakata. Mr. Sakata? I would like to change the handoff location. Change? Hello? A change of location? Yes, get out there soon. Go to... Hey. How was it? He'll come out. But he has some companions. As I expected. Stupid old man. Sabu! Good. Now do it again the same way. The next location is... Mr. Sakata from Den-en-chofu, there's a call for you. Please come to the front desk in the lobby to take the call. Is this Mr. Sakata? I don't like it when there are four plainclothes cops around. I can't promise a lot. I understand. I'd be alone from now on. No, I swear. You can pick a new place that's convenient for you. Then please come out right now. Walk to the American Embassy. There, get into a cab. Go to... Sabu, get ready. Yeah. It's finally time. Go. Mr. Sakata... Please put it away quickly. The bag. My grandchild...? He's okay. Really? He's still alive, right? Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be returned to you. There he is. What the hell are they doing?! Bro! What the hell are you up to? I don't know anything! Bitch! Stop! Bro! - Damn it! - Wait! Hey, bro! Do you even know what the bastard's up to?! Are we just going to let him go? Damn it! Bro, what should we do? Hey! Damn it! Hey, you go bring him here! Or I'll blow this little brat's brains out, damn it! Go! Still not going? What are you dawdling for?! Get your ass out there! I've had enough of this! I won't listen to you! If you're going to kill me, kill me! - Bastard! - Sabu! Wait! Sabu! - What's going on? - Let's go check it out. What's going on? Hey. Gimme the baby. Gimme the baby! Hurry up! Hurry up! You old hag! Son of a bitch! Dad! Masao! Please make way! Get in! Please! - Please give us a statement! - Please! Ma'am, please! THE END
