“Sometimes the most scenic roads in life are the detours you didn't mean to take.” Angela N. Blount You got it? - Yes, I got him! Hold his wrists. Are you keeping him? - I hold his wrists! Otherwise, what the fuck am I holding? You're dropping him, can't you see? - And what should I do? No... No, no, no! My jacket! Jesus! What's up? What you looking at? I’ll slap you, Motherfucker! Fuck you! - No, fuck you man! Do you know how much I paid for this, did you? But it was already dirty! - Will you stop squabbling just as if you were two little virgins? You keep your big fucking nose out of this! My jacket... What an asshole... We’re going to bring him out or not? Come on! Let's do it! You got it? Can you do it? - Yes, I got him! Fuck... Wait! Take it easy! Bring him! Take him out! I'm here! - Help me! What the fuck did you eat, bro? Fuck! Holy shit! Go! I know what you're thinking... Who we are? Who's the beat up man and what the fuck are we doing here? Do you want really to know? How we got in here? So, brace yourselves, because what you're about to see... Is fucking insane. ROAD TO HELL Come on! But how could you miss a shot so easy? - Shut up! No, no, no, no, no! Be careful with it, okay? You made me lose my match! You idiots! I'm sorry Rusty! I'm sorry! See ya later, Rusty! If you break my record, I'll buy you a pizza! Hi Rusty! Your pizza is coming. There's something wrong! Hi Rusty! - Here your pizza! Hi Rusty! Hi Rusty! Oh, Hi Rusty! It all started right here. You know what you’ve got to do, right? - Ahhhh! Hey, hey,hey, where the fuck are you going? Come here! Be quiet guys, please! - And you, give us what we asked for, come on! And the first one that makes a wrong move or just tries to say a word will get a big stamp on his forehead! As you can see, my friends are very nervous. We don't want to go from bad to worse, right? Right?! - No... Good! All. I want it all. Okay, maybe I started from the wrong side of this story, so let's take another step back. Good, another one and it should be enough. - Damn Rusty, still another one? Take it up with that dickhead and not with me. What the fuck do you want? - What the fuck I want? What the fuck I want? If you hadn't been an asshole, now we wouldn't in debt to Vincent Costello of those fucking EUR 30000. So we have three choices: A) We get shot in our head because of you. B) We'll pay the fucking EUR 50000 to the Swiss to state we're dead and to reach Switzerland, so if you don't sell your ass to a fucking rich man, you’ll not get 50000 bills even in 30 years. And then the last one, the C choice, i.e. that after twelve fucking successful robberies thanks to me that I wasn’t part of it, we’ll do a final job to settle a debt that you caused. Or there’s an extra choice. What? I’ll kick your ass and I’ll carry you to Vincent Costello to settle the debt you caused. Motherfucker! - Come on, hit me! Hit me! Hit me! - Oh, oh, oh! Stop for fuck's sake! We’re in deep shit now, right? So set this fucking job and pay what we owe. Okay?! All right?! Okay? Anthony this is none of our goddman business. We’re helping him and he disrespects us, I’ll kill him! He gets shot right between the eyes next time bro, but Costello knows we’re helping him, so we’re involved and we must to do this for ourselves, so as not to have any more trouble. Call Lucas and tell him to fill up. Now you understand why we were robbing that drugstore? Because Dario, my ass-wipe cousin, fucked the daughter of Vincent Costello. And Vincent Costello’s men caught them in the act. Ohhh! - What the fuck are you doing? So the boss asked me to do him a favor. I want the head of your cousin Dario. Why me? Because you’re the most badass and unscrupulous man in this Town. Did you do it? Did you do it? - Why don't you start the fucking car? Oh, my God, you did it! Oh yes! O yeah fuck! Oh yeah fuck! We did it! We did it! Thanks guys, thanks! - Okay, okay you blow me later. We’ve been cool, didn’t we? Lucas was cool. A great driver. Thank you Rusty, it’s a great honor for me, really a great honor. Stop to the next service station, I’ll make a call, let’s just get some food and then we’ll go on. Tomorrow we’ll give the money to those motherfuckers and then Adios Italia! Where will you go? Where we’ll go, you mean... To the City of Angels, my friend, to the City of Angels. And what you’ll do there?! - What we’ll do, you mean. Well yes... In short, what all of you’ll do? Well... We’ll open a pizza place! And have you already thought about a name? Big Trouble in Pizzeria! - What happened? No no, we will call it Big Trouble in Pizzeria. Cool! Holy shit! We’re out of fuel! Didn't you have your fill? Asshole... Lucas, you're such a dick. Fuck! I’ll miss you guys, really. I’ll miss you a lot. Thanks! Thanks Rusty! How is that there’s no fucking fast food on the road? I’m hungry, shit! And hope to find one refuelled with petrol. Yes. I think that we’ll be there by ten. Who gets there first wait. See ya later. Why you didn't fill up the car yesterday? - I'm sorry guys... I don't give a fuck of your apology. - Here we are! It's about... Time! Thank you... This is for you too? Yes, he’s coming… I think he's in a meeting in your bathroom. That guy! Excuse me, can you tell us where’s the closest gas station? There should be one at 15 miles, I believe. - We hope to get there! I make you feel my guy... But at least does it still work? You want to try it? - No! I don’t want to be disappointed. - You’ll be happy, instead Why don’t you eat? No eating until everyone’s seated. You fucking rude. Did I miss something? Anthony was flirting with the maid. Shut the fuck up, moron! Are you paying together or separate? - Together please. I can’t wait to get me into a fucking bed and sleep for two days. You won’t have time to sleep. And here's the change. Listen, I know it sounds trite, but if I asked you for your number, would you give it to me? Oh... I’ll guard it with my life! Hold on and don’t move a muscle! Not a sound, shit! Or we’ll unload into you a rain of bullets! You didn’t hear him? Hold on, fuck! Oh, holy shit! You bitch! Put the money in here! Move! What the fuck are you looking at? What the fuck?! Gionata! Gionata, are you okay? He broke my nose! He just fucking broke my nose! I think it’s a bad day for you, guys. I suggest you to get your fucking bags, to get your ass back in your car and to go home! And what if I will don’t give a fuck about your advice? Well, you have two choices. The first one is that we’ll kick your ass and the maid behind me… What's your name? Sara! - Sara! Sara will call the cops, so you’ll be thrown in jail and some black man with a truncheon instead of a foreskin will fuck you. Or, the last choice is-- Hello? Morning my love... - Hello darling, you just woken up? - Excuse me! Yes, just two minutes ago and you’re always my first thought, as you can see. Thanks baby but I’m working, remember? I’ll see you later at the pub, okay? - No, wait , don’t hang up Honey, I can’t talk now! Come on! Wait a little longer... Please, at this time I touch myself. - Oh God! Lily, please... Mmm come here, take me! Oh, Jesus Christ, Lily! Believe me, I wish I was there and to do a lots of nice things with you but I’m working! There you are! You call this complicity? No! This is to treat your girlfriend like some cheap hooker! Rusty, what the fuck are you doing? Whenever I want to fuck you, you always tell me: I don’t want! I’m working! I have a headache! Then when your K2 wakes up and you want jerk you off or to fuck me, I have to be ready for a blow job or to get you excited. And no my dear, no! It doesn’t work that way! It doesn’t work that way! Baby, honey, you’re absolutely right, but now I’m working. I promise I’ll make it up, okay? Sure, like I didn’t know who you are! Lily, please stop yammering for two seconds, relax, listen to music and I’ll call you later. Huh? Okay…I love you... I love you too. Well? Are you done? We were at the second choice, what’s the last one? That we kill you all! Nobody shoots anyone. You understand? The police are coming, so you’d better to lower your weapons and to bring yourselves to justice peacefully. Did you hear what I said? Yes, we heard you! Get down! Rusty! Nooo! Lucas! Ahhh! No, no, no, no, no. Fuck, no! Hold on, my friend. Go away... The cops are coming. - Fuck, no. I won’t leave you here. Go away! The time for me is over. Come on Rusty, we have to go! There’s no enough fuel to reach the next gas station. Take the policeman’s car. I’ll meet you again, brother. That’s a promise. What the... Rusty, that man isn’t a cop. Look at this. For fuck's sake, come on guys! - Meanwhile, go start the car. What... What’s the car of this motherfucker? - Those aren’t the keys of a car, asshole. Those are a camper keys, don’t you fuck see it? Let's fucking go! - Come on! Someday I’ll explain you everything. Fuck! Fuck! It’s no fair! This is wrong! This is wrong, fuck! Lucas died for a good cause. We’ll always be grateful to him. For a go…a good cause? Fuck you Dario! No, fuck you! - No, fuck you! Lucas was a good guy and it’s your fault if he died. My fault? - Yes, your fault. And you don’t give a shit because you’re selfish bastard! If it weren't for us... I remind you that if it weren’t for us you would have been six feet under yet. o, you don’t have to be grateful to him, but you should suck his dick in the grave. You always reproach me, fuck! - Yeah! I’ll hold it against you to my last breath! It's a fucked-up situation! Did you see his badge, Rusty? He wasn’t a cop. What the fuck is Crisalis? - You think I know? I don’t work for the government! And why the fuck should a cop to drive a camper? Anyway, I don’t have to blow anyone! Really? Are you still talking? Are you still fucking talking? What the fuck are you doing? - I'll kill you! Ahhh! - Ohh! Ahhhh! That’s disgusting, Rusty! That’s fucking disgusting! He fell on me, Rusty! What’s a dead man doing in a camper? - That’s disgusting! Please help me! Somebody help me! What the hell? Rusty! Ahh! Who the fuck are you? Yes, when you believe that the worst is over, the unexpected that’ll make your life a ling hell comes. And now we’re all in a world of shit. Did I tell you or not that we were in a fucked-up situation? Ma'am, calm down. There’s a child and I think he’s your son… So put that knife down, I promise we won’t hurt you. Get off my camper, now! Ma'am, we would really like to get off your camper, we never wanted to would get on it indeed! But now we're in here and if you calm down, you can get off at the next gas station and we’ll both be on our way. Okay? Maybe you didn’t hear me. This is my camper and I want you to get off it, right now! Okay! What the fuck are you doing? What the hell is wrong with you? What is this? The Wild, Wild West? Maybe! Listen, dickhead, much blood has been shed today, so calm down or the next bullet goes between your eyes! You hear me? If you need to shoot so much, aim at your head and go fuck yourself! I won’t give you the knife. I didn’t want your knife, I just wanted to shake your hand. Let’s throw down this asshole, he’s starting to smell. A witness told me that three guys came to robbery but that other four guys men shot. One of them was killed. Can I have a minute of your time?, madame? Have you seen these criminals before? No. Can you tell me how my colleague died? He said the police were coming… One of them drew his gun and… The others didn’t agree, they didn’t want to kill him What car they got away in? They took the keys of a camper out of the pocket of your colleague. And drove off with that. Could you recognize that? No... No, I can’t. And tell me, madam, were these people with them? No. Well? They weren’t with them, but the guys that shot killed 087 and got away with a camper. What should we do with the camper? 087 had the keys. Ah! I think that the bitch is in the camper! Did 043 die in the crossfire too? There’s no sign of him, sir. No, no, no, no, no... Dad, you don’t seem to understand, I don’t give a fuck of your men. The bitch has something that doesn’t belong to her and we have to get it back before it’s too late! Don’t worry, son. We’ll find her. According to witnesses, the fugitives weren’t untrained, they knew what they were doing. I suppose they’re pros. Security cameras weren’t online and the girl said that the camper went that way. Pros, eh? - Ah! So, it went that way? And what the fuck are you waiting for to chase them? Claudio, be patient! Okay? 066, take me to the town. Perhaps, I have an idea about who might know these "pros". I know it’s none of my business, but today one of my friends died because of one of these motherfuckers. I think that… You killed 043. Who are they? Not your problem. Sure it is. Fuck, it is. Untill we reach our stop, it’s my problem too. No one told you to get on this camper. Instead, I think it’s really good for you that we got on here and not the partner of your friend in suits. As you said, our boy was dead. Don’t you think that his partner... Could have done the same way? A mother that kills someone without pity in front of her son... Is mad... Or hopeless... Or she’s hiding something. And what if there’s a fourth chance? Chances are always three. Wake up! Don’t you hear your mobile ringing? Hello? Rusty, it's for you! I'm gonna go take a leak. Hello? Rusty, change of plan. I need that money as soon as possible. We’ve had a setback, but we’ll be on time tomorrow. We’re on the road. I heard about the crossfire and that’s the reason why it’s too risky to meet you in the city tomorrow, so I decided that we’ll join you. Do you remember The Blond? Yes, I do. Well, meet us there. Where’s this place? Mr Di Caprio asked me for a favor and I’ll do it. But this is my business, so I ask you to stay out of it. To decide if to trust a person or not is like climbing a tree or not, because one could enjoiy an amazing landscape or simply to get dirty with resin. This is the reason why many people want to spend their time alone and at home, where is harder to prick themselves with a sliver. Snicket said so. Trust me and you’ll have what you asked me. Thank you! You promised me that you will not hurt Dario. And I always keep my promises, my child. No... Costello asked to meet us in the cabin. The cabin of torture? Exactly. Why? I don’t know but the faster we get the fuck them out of our way, the better. Me and my son need to stop. Why? There’s the toilet on the camper, use it. It’s out of order, or we would have use it already. What the... Holy shit! Why should I do anything you ask me to do? I don’t even know your name and honestly you’re not even funny. And why would I be funny with some strangers and killers, no less? - And professional thieves. Yes, it's true. We’re engaged in a special job. But now, we have a long journey to do together, so to know your fucking name would be less than nothing. Julia. I’m Julia and he’s Nicolas. Rusty. - Dario! The toilet is out of order. So don’t go in. Anthony! I’m fucking starving. Come on, stop at Lili’s pub. Are you serious? I’m always serious. Hell, yeah! I’ll eat a hamburger as big as this fucking camper. Did I miss something? You smell like shit. Aaaaaaaaaaah! What the hell! I’ve told you everything , Jesus! Why do you keep fucking torturing me? And what if I don’t believe you? Well, that’s not my problem! Last chance, what happened to The Blond and above all where? I... I... No... No, please no! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah fuck! Aaaaaaaaah! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I don't fucking know, man! I’ve never worked for Vincent Costello! The guy who sent us to talk to you, before becoming fertiliser, has assured us that you know Vincent Costello very well and above all his business. Maybe, you know even his robbers. Rob... Rob... Rob... Robbers? Do you know them? Oh, man... If you’re talking about Rusty, you’re in deep shit. He’s mad! He’ll kick your ass, really! Really? Nooo! Nooo! Mirko!! What the fuck are you done? Nooo!! Mirko! Mirko! I hope you understood that I don’t want to waste my time. What happened to The Blond? Where he was killed? You son of a bitch! Okay... Okay... I spit it out! The Blond lost a Vincent Costello briefcase full of cash at betting. He begged the boss for mercy, but Vincent Costello gave him one last change. 24 hours, not a second longer! But The Blond didn’t obey. He tried to escape but he didn’t know that Vincent Costello thugs were after him. Costello asked to Rusty to find a remote location to torture that motherfucker and Rusty brought him into his cabin in the woods. Rusty!! Rusty please!! Help me! Rusty don't leave me here! Rusty please! - Make it quick, then clean! Rusty, please!!! Rusty!! Rusty!! But I don’t know where that fucking cabin is! Okay. I trust you. Really? Thank goodness! Oh my God! Thank goodness! Thank goodness! So will you let me go? I’ll do. But he won’t. You can’t smoke inside here. Are you a fucking cop? It bothers me eating with the smell of smoke. I don’t see you eating. - Yes, but the smell of cigarette smoke gets up through my nose and I don’t like eating with smoky aftertaste. If you weren’t Rusty’s cousin I’d have kicked your ass. Rusty... What the fuck are you laughing at? Do you know why he calls himself Rusty? The nephews names were chosen by my granny. His real name is Ferruccio. Obviously, I’m not saying anything to you or he wouldn’t think twice to shoot us in the head. What’s it to me? You’re the one who is telling me all. - Yes, But now you know all too. You’ve been thick as thieves from ten years, there’s must be a reason if he never told you anything, right? Anyway, when he was foureen one of his own age took the piss of him all the time because of his name. What’s up little Ferruccio? Do you want your granny’s boob? Do you want it? Rusty clearly got angry, so he took a rusty crowbar and broke him the jaw and both his cheekbones. He put him in a coma. Hence his name Rusty. Rusty means with rust and everybody in the city began to call him so. That’s was the first of a longer list of crimes and fights. But Rusty has never hurt innocent people, he has always killed and extorted money to those who had a criminal record but you’re supposed to know that, right? And it was fine, till you came along. I’m the chili in the soup! Have you already ordered some food? Not yet. Why? Do you want to order some food too? I have not eaten in two days, you know? Excuse me! Are you hungry? Can you pay the dinner? I don’t have my handbag. Rusty! What are you doing? - What have I done? We can’t do it here in front of everybody. But if there’s a fucking nobody! Yes, I know... But you know that I like to making love with you, lying in bed, having snuggle… I don’t just want to fuck, that’s all! But I’m not fucking you. Really? And what is this? If you keep doing that, it gets hard, huh? - Yeah? Oh yeah! A beer, please! Come back later, she’s busy now. If I saw her busy with other customers, I would have waited my turn, but I think she is free. Baby, calm down, okay? Look man, today has been a fucking day, so I need to relax, thus go into another fucking pub and get the fuck off! I’m passing by and... I don’t want to drink anywhere else if not here. Look man, you’ve picked the wrong guy to-- Ah! I didn’t recognize the voice of a fucking cop. Ops, of a retired cop, sorry! Are you done being a dick? Or what, you’ll arrest me? Or did you forget to bring your handcuff? I can’t arrest you as you know, but I could stick a bottle of beer up your asshole. I know you like it. Honey, could you give a beer to me too, please? Thanks. So, how was the robbery? Robbery? What robbery? But how, haven’t you heard? The usual four sons of bitches that did another theft and this time they even killed four people. As you can see, there’re three of us. In fact that sissy of Lucas was found dead at the fast food. - Hey! Okay, he was one that he sucked cock, but he was a good boy. Respect him! It wasn’t meant it as an insult, I respected him. He was the one that could be saved between you. I saw the camper outside, are you taking a trip? Yeah love, I saw it too. It’s a bit dated but it’s very nice! Is that for us? No honey, I just borrowed it. Yeah? And from whom? From the woman that is sitting at the table with Anthony and Dario. Ah! And since when do you travel with a woman? Honey, don’t start, okay? - Why not? Are you sneaking around now? That's why today you did not give me satisfaction on the phone? Did you already fucked her? - What... What the fuck you talking about? Christian, don’t you pay? He said he’s buying. Where the hell is he going? Hey, that isn’t his table! - And who pays for the beers? They were two pints! - How fucking are you expensive? Keep the change. Hello guys! - There... We needed a fucking cop sitting at our table to ruin our night. Ex-cop. But I still have the gun, you prick! What are doing a beautiful woman and a child with these dickheads? Hey man, get the fuck out. And when did we became friends? Yeah, we aren’t, so fuck you and go away! What’s your name? I told you to go away, fuck! I’m going to get another beer. Are you always so nervous? Only when someone pisses me off. It seems to me that almost everyone pisses you off. - Perhaps this world isn’t for me. Well, there's a hotel here in the back, you and the midget could sleep there. Tomorrow you’ll call a taxi and you'll go wherever you like. Maybe, it's not clear enough to you that the camper is mine and I have a precise destination where to go. Therefore, as agreed, you will stop at the next stop tomorrow morning, while my son and I will leave for our business. This is the agreement. And where are you going? This doesn't concern you. She’s good, eh? Who ordered this sandwich for me? I’ve ordered a Bacon Burger. Don’t you always order this? Yes, but... But yes! Nicolas... Nicolas wake up! How much does he eat? My little boy is hungry! Excuse me? What? I’ve ordered a Chicken Burger no cheese... - And? Well, there’s cheese here. - Take it off, huh! Honey! - What? Have I offende your little slut? Wait - come again? Honey, stop that, okay? Come here! Sit down here and be nice. I would pluck your eyeballs out of their sockets, you stupid bitch! - What'd you say? That you’re nice! You eat a lot for being a midget! What a gaze! Nicolas! Boy, why don’t you speak? Cat got your tongue? My son is of few words. - No, your son doesn’t speak at all, which is quite different. Maybe, he has nothing to say. Can I eat my sandwich in peace, Christ! You talk too much, fucking hell! No, I already ate. Are the latest ones? Yes, Sir. Doctor Leonardi, are you telling me the truth? Are the latest ones? I swear, Sir. Every test tubes have been destroyed. Claudio call 066 and ask him if there are some news, then tell him to come and pick up the package for delivery. Give him the details. Why me? I’m not one of yours kiss-ass. Why don’t you let this nice pussy to do it? Isn’t her business to doing that, son. Really? Mr Di Caprio, if you’re done with us we’d like to go back to the lab to clean up and then to pack for the transfer. What’s your rush? Claudio! No, no dad, wait! So, what’s your rush? I… I’m in no hurry, sir, but we did our job, we delivered everything two hours early. We have cleaned out almost the entire building, but there’s still so much work to be done, that’s all. You know what? What sir? You don’t like me. No, no, I don’t trust your face. Mr Di Caprio, tell to your son that he’s wrong, please. I’ve been working for you since I was a boy. My dad was your closest friend. Claudio. What a pretty face! Thank you, sir. Mmm, you smell good. Mr Di Caprio, can we go now? Doctor Leonardi, watch your tone. My son isn’t doing anything wrong and then, it seems that the lady doesn’t mind his attentions. Doctor Leonardi, It’s not nice having hurry if there’s so much to talk about. For instance, do you know what happens to those who betray us? No, sir. I knew it! - Maria!!! Why did you do this? She was my friend! She was a brilliant doctor. She trusted you! But we didn’t trust her. Now you know know what happens to those who try to fuck us. Doctor Leonardi, come back to your room. That’s all for today. Was that really necessary? No, but I wanted to do. She had a small mouth and I wouldn’t like to stick it in her mouth. Instead of thinking about these bullshit, you should have been more careful with your wife. Ex-wife. Ex or not, she is on the run with my own property. But you let her slip away. Just a little bump in the road. - Well! So fix the tarmac and take my property back! Yes, sir! As you asked to me, I’ll send a message to the puppy 066. If you'll excuse me. Get somebody to clean my office. Well, if there’s no one, then you come instead to clean it! Pick me up when you’re done, okay? Sure, baby. Stay close to him. - No need to say it! You instead, stay away from him. Okay? See you cop, in this life or another. You better hope never see me in this. What the fuck? I told you that we’d see each other tomorrow. I didn’t want to wait. How did you know we were here? Rusty, Doesn’t look good, Rusty. - Come on, Rusty! What a foolish questions! We all know this is your lady friend’s pub. She’s my girl. Watch your mouth about her. I don’t think you’re in a position to threaten me now, Rusty. Am I wrong or have you something of mine? Go get the bag. Dario! Go get the bag! Give me the keys! - It’s already open. What a great guy! Rusty, I heard you shout, what’s up? - Honey, go inside. Don’t worry... Lily! Just stay here with us. It’s so good for my eyes to see you. Is it all there? Count it! No, I know Rusty, he’s a pros and very exact in his work. You got what you wanted. Now we’re even. Actually, we’re not even yet. No, Lily! You stay here with us! What the fuck are you doing? You’re a dead man Vincent! You’re a fucking dead man! Now, the man who has a gun to his head, it’s not me. If your thug shoots, you’ll die. Ooh, I don’t think that. You’re really at a disadvantage. I could shoot you and your friends first and your cousin last, right? Let her get out. Dario! Dario! Katia... What’s she doing here? What’s she doing here? - Dad, let him go! Dad! I want this to be a lesson to all of you, to teach you don’t mess with me. We did our job, Vincent. We got you what you asked for. We know you’re a man of honor. And I’m. Nobody’s dying today if… If you’ll hand me the woman and her son. Are you running away from Costello? Who? I never saw him before! Rusty! What the fuck you waiting for? Hand them! - Rusty, please! Rusty, for Christ’s sake! If you don’t go through with it, we’ll all die! Don’t do it, please! Why them? Come on, Rusty! You’re still the same nosey. None of your business. Hand me the woman and her son and I’ll go away satisfied! Who guarantees that none of your men will pull the trigger? - The honour Anthony, you said it before, isn’t? - Rusty! Fuck, bro, do what he says. All right. Nooo! Nooo! Fuck!! You bastard! My love… My love! My love! No! You’re a monster! You’re a monster! I hate you! I hate you! I can do another daughter whenever I want. The woman and her son, Rusty. Or I’ll take them by force. No... Nicolas. Hey, man! Go inside the camper! No! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! No!! Let me go! Go inside, come on! Go inside! - No! My son! I have to take my son! I have to take my son! I have to take my son! - I’ll take you son! But now you have to go inside the camper! Nicolas! Nicolas! Nicolas... - Let me through! Relax, my boy. It’s all over. It’s all over. What’s the feeling you get before you die? We need to leave here. It's freaky, isn’t it? Just as in a few hours every single piece of your life can change. Mother nature has the power to mocking us, of our fears, our of weaknesses. We are many ants, inside a sphere standing on nothingness... Who are we? What’s our worth? Why so much suffering? No one’s a saint, and we don’t want to be. But we too... We too have the right to grieve. We have the right to hope. Hope that one day we will hug our loved ones one more time, and we will be able to tell them what we should have said to them every day. But now... Right now… I only wish for one thing Revenge. I wish rip his heart from his chest, I wish to gouge his eyes with my own hands. I want him to spit blood, I want to smash his skull and piss inside. This is what I want. I want to fuck every inch of their souls. Whoever did this will feel my wrath! You’re twelve minutes early. What a precision! The taxi arrived early and I didn’t want to wait in the lobby. So? Are you going to invite me in? You treat you right. A man like you would be able to rage hormones fire in a menopausal woman. That was a compliment. So, do we get this towel off or not? Take off your dress. What a hurry! Take off your dress. Mmm, how mean you’re! That’s the way you like me! Do I get something else off? Your body is so... Hard... Carved... Exciting. I wonder how many women would love to touch a body like yours and I’m, instead, so lucky that I can touch it and enjoy it. What impetuosity! Lie down. I love the tough man. Lie down I said. - And even a boss. Take me. There's... There's a bathroom in the back if… If you want to have a shower. There must be some clothes in the rooms. I hope they’re okay. I doubt we all get in the house, but if we adapt… perhaps... - It’s fine. I’ll sleep on the couch. I’d like to have the opportunity to take a shower... If I may. I think that we’ll all take that opportunity. I’ll be the last If you want, have a shower you and your son first, I can wait. Thanks. Come on... Don’t say a word. I don’t know how to answer that. Oookay! I’ll get to the stove since I doubt that anyone wants cook. Never mind. I’ll be right back, okay? May I? Ehm, you said there’re some clothes in rooms and… Me and my son would need them, that’s all. It’s for him? It’s to protect him that you’re running away? Yes... Who are they? They're the bastards who ruined my son's life. And is there... A cure for that.. I’m going to get it. I’m going there. We’re going there . You can find the clothes in the other bedroom. In the closet. Perhaps they could be a little large or small, I don't know... Thank you, Rusty. A toast to Dario! - A toast to Dario! If he could have been with us now,x surely he would have fucked me off about my cooking the hamburgers. And not only about that, man. - Your hamburgers are delicious! You’re not short of anything. Do you like it? It’s not bad. It’s for sale if you’re looking to buy. How much? It’s worth € 1 million at least. - Ahh!! I’ll build it myself. Well, but this has more value. Because of many dead bodies buried in the garden? Who would’ve thought that someday I’d dinner with a fucking cop in my home. And me with a fucking thug. And me with a little Hannibal. Be careful what you say. I don’t even try to threat you. I still have a pending fuck. With your right hand? - No, with your sister. She’s lesbian. - I know how to please her a dick. By the way Rusty, Guess what I found in my pants. The maid phone number. I swear that if I survive this crap situation , I’ll be my first stop. To fuck your right hand? - To give a real dick to your sister. There’s a child sitting at the table, in case you haven’t noticed. - And there’re ladies too. What else? Julia is right. There’re children sitting at the table. What a fuck! So, tell me, why they say that you’re a retired cop? Because I was suspended from duty for a brawl. Mr good guy put three men in the hospital. And then he become a lawman with us. I’ll put in there the fourth soon. So, what will happen tomorrow? The hell. The hell is waiting for us. Well, if this is my last dinner I’m glad to be with you. Even with a fucking cop. So, a toast to our last dinner. And the last dinner be! Christian! Yes? Why don’t I come over? Nicolas is sleeping in the bedroom and the others are "busy", so I don’t know where to go since I’m not sleepy yet. Sounds like they like to stay with us. - Looks that way! Do you smoke? No, I quit ages ago. Me too. But after what I saw today, I think I might have one. What happened to your son before? He almost died, this is what happened. What do you mean? Every time he... He transforms, his body endure a huge stress and he could die at any moment. Is he born this way? No. Those men did it? No, No, but I know who sent them. And your husband was… Was killed, I mean? He’s the one who is hunting me. He and his father are the head of a society called Crisalis. I worked for them. They are a secret society specialized in creating chemical and biological weapons. Many disease have been created and spread by them. I worked together with Davide Leonardi, a young chemical but one of a kind. That bastard of my ex and his father cut a deal with people in highest ranks. I’ve never known who these people were, but they often work with politicians and military. They created a vaccine able to alter aggression, strength and adrenaline levels of a living being. They created it with the intention of turning man into a military weapon. But when they did the first test on an animal it was a total disaster. Imagine a Labrador with the strength of a lion and the aggressiveness of a snake. The dog suddenly went mad and mauled the whole crew in the room, and then the animal died, alone. Jesus Christ! I feel like I’m in a fucking videogame. And the irony is that it’s true. Obviously my "ex husband" wouldn’t listen to him and claimed that the animal body is lower than human being. Now, try to imagine on who he tested the vaccine. How the fuck could anyone do something like that to his son? I think you’re attracted to psychopaths given the fact that you’re also traveling with crazy people. It can be, but about my ex, he was rich I was young, and I thought I would have had a good life and instead… Instead you got a son with the super powers. That I’m afraid to lose every time he activates his "powers". This is so fucked up. Yeah! This is so fucked up. And tell me, you’re a psycopath too? Well, it’s the two of us, Sara. Ohhh yeah!! Do you like it baby? Do you like it? Ohhh yes! Sara!! Where are you? - What the... I’m here waiting for you! - Get back in the kitchen, you asshole! Where’s the chicken? Go to jerk off or your balls will explode! - I’ve done it twice. What’s this? It's so big! Okay! Okay! I’m going, I’m going. Lily! - Rusty! Rusty! Go get the boy! Nicolas! Run! Alive. - Noo Nicolas! Get out Nicolas! Holy shit! Nooo! Leave my son! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! You son of bitch! Your husband’ll be happy to see you. Let me go! Let me go! - Get her too. Let me go! Let me go! I’ll find you, Lily! I’ll find you! - Rusty! Rusty! Rusty! Hey, you! Fight like a man. I‘ll please you. Christian, don’t do it. Kill them and set this place on fire. I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you all. It's a promise! We have to go! Yes, but where? There’s no address on his I.D. What the fuck are you doing? Are you calling the cops? Can’t you just shut up for a second? Hi skinny, Navolio’s speaking. Listen, I need to ask you something. Remember when you told me about a strange mansion where you delivered the package? That's right! Just where there’re the men in black. Do you remember the address? Don’t ask me why and do me this favor. Thanks man, text it to this phone number. Being a cop has its perks. We can’t get in there looking like this. Then let’s just get us settled and let’s go dressed for the prom. I hope there’s my size! Lily! Hi, my love. Did you sleep well? Where’s Nicolas? He’s safe. For now. Sottotitolo What are you going to do? What’s it for that? Davide, please... Don’t do it. Don’t worry honey, You’ll not be hurt. Not by our hand, at least. - You’re a bastard, Claudio. You son of a bitch! What do you mean? You know Nicolas, her son? Well, Here, we’re going to transform his mom too, just like him. To satiate her, we’ll give her you. Davide, please! Please don't do it! Doctor Leonardi, do it! I'm sorry, Julia. No! Nooo! No, Davide! Please don't do it! We’re friends. I never hurt you. I never hurt you! Do it, I said. Are you tired, kid, eh? But you have shown much more resistance than expected. You're about to die you, know it? I told my son we could run some more tests before injecting him, but... He didn’t listen to me. You proved that man is more resistant than an animal, but not strong enough to survive for long. After the last test we’ve run, three transformations were enough to kill a man, but apparently your body is tougher than those of adults. Maybe, we should use children as war machines. What do you think about it? You have the same eyes as your mother and you also get the same hate. When she get transformed, release her and lock them up in the room. - No, sir. What? I said no. I won’t be an accomplice of one of your sadistic playing. The motherfucker just chopped off his nuts. Go open the door. Cut me loose, please! Please! Send immediately 066 and 072 and any available unit to the front door. - Only a unit stayed at the headquarter, sir. The others have already moved as you requested. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! How long do I have? - Little, very little time. Julia, listen to me, You have to get out of here. I'll pick you-- Ahhh! - Nooo! You filthy whore! They’re on to us, shit! - Really? I didn’t realize it! If I shoot, they’ll hit me! - Then die by staying still! I can’t go on! - You are such a fucking dick... Instead of complaining like a fucking toddler, grow a pair and shoot. Motherfuckers! I want to try too. What the fuck! Why didn’t you come up earlier? Who’s shooting inside my building? - Don't worry, sir. We’ll fix the situation soon. 066! Where’s the suitcase? - It’s in the trunk of my car, sir, ready to leave. Good, fix this situation and let’s go. Oh, shit! Julia! Julia! Tell me. I didn’t mean it. They killed Maria too. I know, I know you didn’t mean it but now you have to tell me where can I find the antivirus? It’s too late. I was told to eliminate all test tubes. The doctor has last antivirus. They’re moving, I don’t know where they’re going to, but they’re bringing everything with them. - No! Nicolas’ll die without the remedy. Nicolas’ll die, Julia. He will die. Face it! And you with him. Shut up! - Shut the fuck up or I’m gonna shoot you! Julia! Listen to me, I was... I was said to eliminate all test tubes, but I didn’t. What you mean? What the fuck are you talking about? - Shut up! I saved one, but only one. I saved it for you, but now you have to decide if use it for you or your son. - Julia, what’re you waiting for? Inject yourself. No... This isn't for me! Ahhhh! - Julia! Oh, no! Lily! Take it! Go to save my son! Fuck you! Go to get her son! Go! That was cool, I must say it. Rusty! - Lily! Where’s Julia? - She has been transformed her just as her son. She was injected with something in her arm. Shit! - A doctor has given the antivirus to her, but she wants to use it for her son! - Where’s the boy? I don't know! It gets better and better. - I’m going after Julia. I’ll come with you. You stay with Lily and find the boy! Please, don’t leave me again. - I’ll be back soon. I promise. Stay with Lily! Come on, Lily! Let's go! Julia! You know me? I'm Davide... Your-- Help me! Please, help me! Ahhhhh! We found Julia. Julia, relax! It’s me, Christian! Please, relax! Julia! Relax... Julia... Julia... Christian... Yes. Lovely to see you. For me too. Please... Save my son. I will. Oh oh! What? We got company. Go to take the boy, I’ll manage. Are you sure? Go fuck yourself. Well, here we go. I can't wait! What’s up? You’re harmless in chains, right? You stupid son of a bitch! You’ll die here, monster! Why are you in such a hurry? Here’s the boy! Where’re you taking me? - Out of here. My son is in there! - They’re already looking for your son, but it’s no longer safe for you here. Oh, shit! Not so sassy now, are we? Fucking get him off me! Get him off me! - Ahhhhh! That’s Julia! - Follow him! Now, we’re going to have a little talk and you’ll tell me where the antivirus is. Stand back! Don’t come any closer! Noo! Noo! Nooooo! Let me go! Let me go! As you wish. No! No! No, no, no, no, no! Nicolas! Please, no! Nicolas, don’t, please! Nicolas, don’t, please! No! Nicolas! Goodbye. No harm comes to the women and children, motherfucker. Rusty! What’s wrong? A little spat. But it was worth it, now I know where the antivirus is -- Aaaah! You know what old Jack says at time like this? No! What the hell! Where are you hit? In my shoulder. Luckily, it’s just a scratch. Thanks, man. I’m ready to follow you everywhere, bro. Even in hell. I’d give my life for you, too, bro. And now let’s go to take the fucking antivirus! - And be gentle, shit! Hold on honey! Hold on! Lift up his sleeve. Please let this work. And, how will you do? My son is more important than me. No... No! No, no, no, no, no, no! My love! Don't leave me! Honey, please... Honey, don’t, please. Mom... Yes, Honey! I’m here, Mommy’s here. Julia! - Mom! Julia! Holy shit! Christian! The antivirus is in the trunk of that asshole. Not so tough, huh? You, motherfucker! First the son, then the mother. It runs in the family. Do you think they’re vegan? But if just the boy ate two Big Chicken Burgers. - You’re right! We have to stop her, otherwise she’ll eat all of us, far for being vegan. Okay! We’ve survived till now, we’ll survive this too. Come on, let's go! Where the... Honey, calm down. What big eyes you have! They’re unusual but beautiful. Blue or yellow? Fuck if I know, man! What’s the color of the wire you should never cut? - Blue, it’s the blue one. Hold her down. - As if that’s so easy. What a fucking day! Lily! Where’s the serum? The blue one is inside you, the yellow one is away with the giant man. You kicked his ass, though. Yeah! I kicked his ass. Mom! Ah! Now Hannibal can speak! Are we friends? We're. But you’re still a fucking cop. And you’re a two-bit clown. Keep in touch, won’t you? We’ll see you whenever you want. I’ll see you in my pub. I’m counting on it. Are you sure you don’t want a ride? No, thanks! I don’t want to see this shitty camper anymore and then Anthony gave himself a gift. Do you like my new baby? If I’ll go see her with this, do you think she’ll give it to me? - Tell her what you experienced and she’ll give it to you everyday. You bet, I’ll tell her all! See you! Rusty! Thank you! Don’t worry, I’m not jealous. See you, Hannibal! And so, even our history has a happy ending... More or less. Of course, liters of blood have been spilled and a lot of people have lost they lives but at least... Well at least we survived this storm and that's what matters. And, waiting for another one to come, I am sure that when it comes, we will be ready to face it. Ah! I almost forgot... Ahh! Ohh!! Oh, yeah baby! I love you, fuck! How I missed you... How I missed you! Really have you killed lots of people? Ahhh! You wouldn’t believe! Oh my God! I’m gonna come, I’m gonna come! I'm gonna come! Ten minutes? Really? I’m out of practice, for fuck’s sake! ROAD TO HELL
