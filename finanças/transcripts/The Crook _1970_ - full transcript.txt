BECAUSE IT WAS OUR TELEPHONE. WE WON A CAR WITH THE PHONE. THE KID, TOO. THEY HAD A CAR FOR HIM. I SEE. A SORT OF LOTTERY? THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. A LOTTERY. IT'S A LOTTERY.

AND PLEASE DON'T HARM THE BOY. (policeman) THAT'S ENOUGH. (reporter) HOW OLD IS THE BOY? DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE KIDNAPPERS? AT WHAT TIME DID IT HAPPEN? THE CAR! GET A CLOSE-UP. [television playing] [Daniel playing joyfully] WHAT A DRAG. YOU WATCH HIM, WILL YOU? HEY, MARTINE. YES? YOU KNOW SOMETHING? HE'S A NICE KID, BUT HE WEARS THE HELL OUT OF YOU. GETTING OLD, GRANDPA. THAT'S THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I KIDNAP A KID. AFTER HE PACKS ALL THAT AWAY, I HOPE HE GOES TO SLEEP. WHAT'S HE DOING? BEING A PEST. NO, THANKS. [telephone ringing] HELLO? YES. NO, NOTHING NEW YET. [bell ringing] HOLD ON, WILL YOU? IT WAS JUST DELIVERED! (policewoman) THEY JUST DELIVERED A LETTER. LEAVE THEM ALONE! LOOK AT THAT. ONLY A MINUTE AGO. HOLD ON, WE MAY HAVE SOMETHING. IS IT THE FIRST CONTACT THEY'VE MADE WITH YOU? LOOK, IT'S HARD ENOUGH, LEAVE US ALONE. HOW MUCH DO THEY WANT? DO THEY WANT TO BE PAID IN DOLLARS? (man) CAN YOU TELL US THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER? WE JUST RECEIVED A LETTER. YES. NO, IT WAS DELIVERED. WAIT, I'LL READ IT TO YOU. "MADAM, YOUR LITTLE BOY, DANIEL, "IS VERY MUCH ALIVE AND WELL. "NO HARM WHATSOEVER HAS COME TO HIM. HE'S RECEIVING THE BEST CARE." "MADAM, YOUR LITTLE BOY, DANIEL, "IS VERY MUCH ALIVE AND WELL. "NO HARM WHATSOEVER HAS COME TO HIM. "HE'S RECEIVING THE BEST CARE. "WE HAVE ONLY ONE REASON FOR TAKING YOUR BOY: "TO DEMAND A RANSOM. "WE HAVE SET THE AMOUNT OF THIS RANSOM AT $1 MILLION. "WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND "ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO PAY SUCH A LARGE SUM, "BUT YOUR HUSBAND IS AN EMPLOYEE "IN ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKS IN FRANCE "AND IT IS THIS BANK YOU WILL ASK TO PAY THE MONEY. "A PERIOD OF 24 HOURS WILL BE ALLOWED "IN WHICH THE EUROPEAN BANK OF CREDIT "WILL MAKE ITS DECISION "WITH REGARD TO THE MONEY IN QUESTION. "BY THE END OF THIS GRACE PERIOD, "YOU WILL RECEIVE ALL THE INFORMATION NECESSARY "CONCERNING THE MANNER IN WHICH "THE MONEY IS TO BE HANDED OVER TO US "AND HOW YOUR SON WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU. "SHOULD THE BANK REFUSE TO PAY THE RANSOM, "YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE "OF SEEING YOUR BOY AGAIN. "THE BANK WOULD THUS BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE "FOR THE DEATH OF YOUR SON. "NO POLICE INVESTIGATION IS TO BE UNDERTAKEN "DURING THIS PERIOD OF 24 HOURS. "OTHERWISE WE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PUT THE BOY TO DEATH." NATURALLY THERE'S NO SIGNATURE. AND IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED, THE LETTER WAS COMPOSED ON AN OFFICE LABELER. I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED A DEMO. GENTLEMAN, LET'S GET DOWN TO WORK. YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE THIS ROOM UNTIL WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION. SINCE TIME IS SHORT, WE HAVE TO ACT FAST. MR. PRESIDENT, SURELY YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY BANK THAT WOULD GIVE IN TO SUCH BLACKMAIL? I'M ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO IT. A CHILD'S LIFE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. IF WE WERE TO GIVE IN TO THEIR DEMANDS, WE WOULD SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. BEFORE LONG, NO ONE WOULD BE SAFE. UP TILL NOW, THESE KIDNAPPINGS, THESE ABDUCTIONS HAVE PLAGUED ONLY THE CHILDREN OF THE RICH. SOON THEY'LL BE KIDNAPPING ANYBODY. MAY I CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO JUST ONE PASSAGE OF THIS LETTER? "SHOULD THE BANK REFUSE TO PAY THE RANSOM, "YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE "OF SEEING YOUR BOY AGAIN. "THE BANK WOULD THUS BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF YOUR SON." THE BANK. THE STOCKHOLDERS WILL MEET AT THE END OF THE MONTH. WHY DON'T WE PUT THE QUESTION TO A VOTE? MR. ALEXANDRE, THE STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING IS IN 2 WEEKS. THE RANSOM HAS TO BE PAID TODAY. TONIGHT. JACQUES, YOU ARE JEOPARDIZING YOUR POSITION. IT'S NOT MY POSITION WHICH IS IN JEOPARDY. IT'S THE BANK'S REPUTATION. I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE YOUR FACE TOMORROW. WHAT IF THEY DON'T PAY? DO YOU HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT? YEAH, FIRST NATIONAL. IMAGINE THE FIRST NATIONAL IN THE SAME SITUATION. THE BANK WON'T PAY. THE BOY IS KILLED. WHAT DO YOU DO? CHANGE BANKS. THEY WON'T LIKE IT IF YOU CHANGE BANKS. OUR PROBLEM IS 50 MILLION FRENCH PEOPLE, AND NOT MERELY ONE KIDNAPPER. COME IN. AND AMONG THESE 50 MILLION FRENCH PEOPLE ARE OUR OWN CUSTOMERS. THE AFTERNOON PAPER, SIR. THANK YOU. I'D SAY THAT THE AFTERNOON PAPER HAS PUT THE PROBLEM VERY CLEARLY. "THE EUROPEAN BANK OF CREDIT IN THE FACE OF PUBLIC OPINION." "DANIEL'S FATHER EARNS 150,000 OLD FRANCS PER MONTH." "RANSOM OF 5 MILLION OLD FRANCS DEMANDED." THE LIFE OF A CHILD IN THE HANDS OF A BANK." (radio announcer) AND AS THE SECRETARY'S TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE MOUNTAIN OF TELEGRAMS AND A HOPELESSLY SNARLED SWITCHBOARD, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MET IN CLOSED SESSIONS TO DECIDE WHAT COURSE OF ACTION TO TAKE. NEITHER THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN BANK OF CREDIT NOR HIS BOARD MEMBERS NEEDED REMINDER OF THE FUROR THEIR CUSTOMERS WOULD CAUSE BY THE MASS WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR DEPOSITS IF THE RANSOM OF LITTLE DANIEL WAS NOT PAID. THE BANK'S PRESIDENT PERSONALLY BROKE THE NEWS OF THE BOARD'S DECISION TO US JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO. IN A VOICE CHOKED WITH EMOTION, HE ANNOUNCED THAT IN A SPONTANEOUS AND HUMANITARIAN GESTURE, THE BANK WOULD MEET THE $1 MILLION DEMAND. HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE FURTHER AND CONCLUDED THE INTERVIEW WITH THESE WORDS: "IT IS OUR SINCERE HOPE THAT DANIEL BE RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY." AND IT IS OUR HOPE TO HAVE GOOD NEWS OF HIS SAFE RETURN ON OUR 11:00 BROADCAST. GO INTO THE CAFE AND ASK FOR-- THAT ONE THERE? YES. ASK FOR 2 ORANGE SODAS. NO, 2 CHERRY SODAS. 2 CHERRY SODAS. ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR THE DOG. ASK FOR 2 STRAWS. YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER WILL COME FOR YOU. WHEN WILL THEY COME? THEY'RE GONNA COME RIGHT AWAY. BUT I WON'T HAVE TIME TO GIVE HIM A DRINK. SURE, YOU'LL HAVE TIME TO GIVE HIM A DRINK. DON'T WORRY. GOODBYE. GOODBYE, UNCLE SIMCA. BE GOOD. BYE. SO LONG, LITTLE SIMCA. DON'T FORGET NOW WHEN HIS NOSE IS WARM, IT MEANS HE'S SICK. YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR HIM. BUT IF HIS NOSE IS COLD-- YOU CAN CALL ANYTIME. TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD THEY CAN BRING YOU WHENEVER YOU LIKE. [pinball machine dinging] HELLO, YES? A LITTLE BOY JUST WALKED INTO YOUR CAFE. DO YOU SEE HIM? YES. THE BOY'S NAME IS DANIEL GALLOIS. HE'S THE ONE THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

I GAVE THEM THE LICENSE NUMBER, AS YOU TOLD ME TO. OK. WHERE'S THE MONEY? IT'S ON ICE. WHAT ABOUT MINE? YOURS IS ON ICE, TOO. BUT WE AGREED I WAS TO GET MY SHARE TONIGHT. I CHANGED MY MIND. WHY? TOMORROW THEY'LL PRINT THE NUMBERS OF ALL THE BILLS IN THE NEWSPAPERS. IT WOULD BE SUICIDE TO USE THAT MONEY FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS. IN A LITTLE WHILE, YOU'LL QUIT THE BANK BECAUSE OF YOUR HEALTH, YOUR HEART. YOU'LL QUIETLY SLIP OUT OF THE COUNTRY. ONLY THEN WILL YOU GET YOUR MONEY. WHAT PROOF DO I HAVE THAT YOU'RE NOT LYING? NONE. BUT YOU MIGHT GIVE ME A LITTLE ADVANCE. YOU'VE BEEN BROKE FOR 40 YEARS. YOU CAN WAIT ANOTHER 6 MONTHS. REALLY? I ALREADY TOLD YOU, IT'S ON ICE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE AGREED. WHAT WE'RE AGREEING TO RIGHT NOW IS THAT YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY IN 6 MONTHS. FORGET IT. THAT WASN'T WHAT WE AGREED UPON. WHAT WE DID AGREE TO WAS THAT YOUR WIFE WOULD BE IN ON IT. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF MY WIFE WAS IN ON IT OR NOT? A BIG DIFFERENCE. GET LOST, GALLOIS. FAST. [engine starting] DID EVERYTHING WORK OUT? YES. HE WAS TOO JUMPY. I THOUGHT I'D BETTER SCARE HIM A LITTLE. I HOPE I DIDN'T SCARE HIM TOO MUCH. IS THERE ANY BEER? YES. NO, DON'T GET UP, I'LL GET IT. (Martine) WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M CHECKING THAT YOU HID IT PROPERLY. (Martine) YOU KNOW, I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS. TAKING UP COOKING? JERK. IS IT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU OR FOR ME? FOR BOTH OF US. IS IT ME WHO'LL HAVE TO PLAY SANTA CLAUS NEXT CHRISTMAS? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME BEFORE? ARE YOU HAPPY? VERY. REALLY! "THE EUROPEAN BANK OF CREDIT PAYS RANSOM AND SAVES CHILD.

WE THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. WE'RE ALL GRATEFUL TO YOU. MOREOVER, THE NEWS WE'VE RECEIVED FROM ALL OUR OFFICES IS EXCELLENT.

NOW, GENTLEMEN, WE'VE ARRANGED TO HAVE YOU MEET SOMEONE WHO'S HERE AND WHO WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO YOU. MR. GALLOIS? COME RIGHT IN.

[birds chirping] ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU, WARDEN? NO, NOTHING. COME ON. QUICKLY. LET'S GO. (radio announcer) SIMON THE SWISS IS BACK IN THE NEWS AGAIN. HE HAS STAGED A SENSATIONAL JAILBREAK, TAKING AS A HOSTAGE THE WARDEN OF THE PRISON HIMSELF. THE DARING ESCAPE WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE HELP OF FELLOW INMATE ALDO FERRARI, WHO WAS CONVICTED ON A CHARGE OF ARMED ROBBERY 3 YEARS AGO. NATURALLY, DURING OUR NEXT NEWS BULLETIN, AT 6:00 P.M., WE WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SITUATION AS THEY OCCUR. THANK YOU, AND PLEASE STAY TUNED FOR OUR 6:00 BULLETIN. TICKETS, MONEY, INSTRUCTIONS, ALL IN THE POT. IS OUR MARRIAGE VALID? COME ON! [speaking in Italian] THEN WHY DID YOU SEND FOR ME? WHY DO YOU THINK? HE ENGINEERED THIS, HE'S THE BRAIN. [all speaking in Italian] OK, IT'S VALID, GET IN. [speaking in Italian] (radio announcer) IT'S 6:00, AND NOW FOR THE NEWS. THE SPECTACULAR ESCAPE OF SIMON THE SWISS IS NOW RELUCTANTLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY POLICE TO HAVE SUCCEEDED. ALL ATTEMPTS TO TRACK THEM DOWN HAVE FAILED. ALTHOUGH THE AREA HAS BEEN SEALED OFF, THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGN OF EITHER OF THE 2 CONVICTS. THEY SEEM TO HAVE VANISHED INTO THIN AIR. HOWEVER, THEIR HOSTAGE HAS MATERIALIZED. THE WARDEN WAS PICKED UP SAFE AND SOUND, THOUGH VISIBLY SHAKEN ON A COUNTRY ROAD, WHERE HE WAS TRYING TO HITCHHIKE BACK TO TOWN. IS IT USUALLY ON TIME? IT WAS ON TIME FOR 4 DAYS STRAIGHT. WHY WOULD YOU DRESS UP LIKE THAT? [scoffs] SPORTY. (radio announcer) THE ARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR SIMON THE SWISS THEREFORE OFFICIALLY CONFIRMS HIS ESCAPE FROM PRISON. PORTS, AIRPORTS, HIGHWAYS, AND RAILWAY STATIONS ARE NOW UNDER SURVEILLANCE AND IT APPEARS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SIMON THE SWISS WILL BE ABLE TO ESCAPE POLICE. ODDLY ENOUGH, PRISON AUTHORITIES RATED SIMON A MODEL PRISONER. HE WAS EVEN BEING CONSIDERED FOR PAROLE AT THE TIME OF HIS BREAKOUT. EVIDENTLY, HE FELT THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE WERE TURNING TOO SLOWLY AND TOOK MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS. ORIGINALLY SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS FOR THE KIDNAPPING OF DANIEL GALLOIS, SIMON DUROC, ALIAS SIMON THE SWISS WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE GANG EVER APPREHENDED. THE IDENTITY OF HIS ACCOMPLICES WAS NEVER DISCOVERED. HOWEVER, THE POLICE ARE CONFIDENT THAT HIS DARING ESCAPE WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD THEM TO THE ARREST OF THE ENTIRE GANG. FAR FROM BEING DISHEARTENED, IT SEEMS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE IN HIGH SPIRITS. (radio announcer) AT 6:35 P.M., JUST MOMENTS AGO, WE RECEIVED WORD THAT SIMON THE SWISS GETTING OFF A TRAIN THAT HAD JUST PULLED IN. HE MANAGED TO SHAKE OFF HIS PURSUERS WHO CHASED HIM INTO THE STREETS. THEY LOST HIM IN A CROWD JUST OUTSIDE 2 MOVIE THEATERS. HE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE SLIPPED INTO ONE OF THEM. IF SO, SIMON THE SWISS HAS AN IRONIC CHOICE OF FILMS: THE CONFESSION AND THE GANGSTER. SIMON WOULD BE TRUE TO FORM IF HE WERE TO HAVE CHOSEN THE GANGSTER, THE NEW MUSICAL BASED ON THE HIGH JINKS OF A SMALL-TIME GANGSTER. I HOPE HE SAW THE CONFESSION, BUT I AM BEING PARTIAL. AND TO CAPTURE SIMON THE SWISS, POLICE MUST FOLLOW BETTER CLUES THAN MY OWN PERSONAL TASTE IN MOVIES. ♪ LE VOYOU ♪ ORCHESTRA. THANK YOU. ♪[music playing] ♪ ALL THE EVIL I'M DOING ♪ POLICE.
