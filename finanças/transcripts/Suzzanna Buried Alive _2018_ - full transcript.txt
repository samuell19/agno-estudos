MAY, 1989 Sir. -Thanks. -Yes, sir. Mr. Satria. Where is she? She is in the bedroom, sir, getting some rest. But she is fine. All right. Honey? Oh? Why are you home early? You called me and told me to come home early. Yes, but I meant after you finish work. Not now. -Have you eaten? -Not yet. -Let me fix you a plate. -All right, honey. -Are you tired? -Not at all. I thought you were the door. Nonsense. How many times do I have to say it? Don't read scary stuff like this, honey. What's wrong? Are you sick? Don't lie to me. You look pale. I wasn't feeling good. But I am okay now. I called the doctor, too. And? It's normal. Normal how? Normal for early pregnancy. You mean... You are... Yes. Finally... We've got what we have been wishing for for five years. Thank God. She's pregnant! What is it, Mia? Mrs. Suzzanna is pregnant! Pregnant! Thank God. I hope the child looks like me. Ew, no. Why would a baby have a mustache? Come on. Let's celebrate. What do you want? I just want your time. To spend more time with you. I think I am craving you! I have to go back to the factory first. I had to excuse myself earlier. But I promise, tonight, all my time is yours. Can I come? No, you're not feeling well. The doctor said I needed fresh air. Besides, if I can spend time with you now, why wait until tonight, right? All right, keep going, keep going. Someone help over there! Mrs. Nur! -How are you? -Good. What about you, Mrs. Nur? I'm good, thank you. Just a minute, honey. Tell me everything! Production is increasing, sales are good too. I'm happy to hear that. This is the third time you've asked for a raise in three months. Are you serious? It's the request of other employees too, sir. Don't tell me it's the request of other employees, when in fact it's you two who plotted this. Your welfare is a primary concern for me. But I will not give you another raise after giving you one three months ago. If you don't, the other employees are thinking of doing a protest, sir. Well, we were just thinking of our welfare. Oh, then gather up all the employees. Let me listen to their thoughts. Hang on. We understand your position, sir. I will try talking to the other employees. Thank you. Let's go. Honey. Honey. Let's pray. It's dawn already. Okay. -Hello. -Hello! Mr. Satria, Mrs. Suzzanna. Let's go. -How are you? -I'm good. I have asked Gilang. He said he's ready to replace me for the work in Japan, sir. Of course he says he's ready. I don't think he's ready. I need someone who doesn't just understand everything about our products, but also someone who can develop a relationship with the Japanese. And I think only you and I can do that. Are you saying I should go to Japan? No, sir. I understand what it feels like waiting for your firstborn. But Satria, trust me. Your wife and child will be there when you get back. All right, sir. Thank you. Don't pack too much, honey. I've packed enough. Besides, you wouldn't want to wear the same outfit for days, right? What would I do without you? Be the Satria you are right now, of course! Thank you, honey. For making me the happiest man on earth. I promise, I will never let anything happen to our little family. I will always protect you and our child. Take care. You too. Take good care of yourself. -Thank you. -You're welcome, sir. Aren't you guys bored being like this? Having no money. And work? We can be fired at any time. I'm not just bored, Jonal. I have had enough of always having to work late like this. What's up with you, Jonal? I have an idea. Let's rob Satria's house. You're crazy. Are you for real? Haven't you heard? Satria is leaving today. To Japan. If we just take one of his cars, and split the money between us, that's more than our salary for months. But there's a lot of people there. What about his wife? What can she do, Dudun? We go there at night, when everyone is asleep. I don't want to do anything that will send me back to prison. I don't want to go to prison either, Umar. Me neither. Let's just cover our faces and not spend too much time there. Who would know? Jonal. The house is practically crowded. There's a man at the gate, there's a maid. And then the gardener. That sounds tricky. Way too tricky for me. The gardener is an old man, right? Can't the four of us handle just a couple of those helpers? You have a point. But Suzzanna is there. Don't let anything happen to Suzzanna. Then you should come, too. Take care of that girlfriend of yours. Honestly, I need money too. But working late like this will never cover the fee for my mother's medication. -She might die because of it. -Oh, no. Don't say that. It's too much. All right! We're doing it? Tomorrow. Why wait until tomorrow? Because tomorrow, Suzzanna and her helpers will go to the movies. Then let's do it tomorrow. So, it's on? Come on, have a drink. Hey, come on. Come in. Mia? Ma'am. I just wanted to tell you that we're going to go to the movies now. Wait, why didn't you tell me beforehand? I want to come too. Are you sure? Shouldn't you be getting some rest? Mr. Satria might call. Satria knows that I like to watch movies on Saturday nights. That's right. Besides, if he wants to call, he'll call a little later. All right, wait for me. I'm going to change. Yes, ma'am. Let's sit here. Get inside. These decorations must be worth a lot. You're right. This is much better than doing business. Go find the car keys. And check the bedrooms. There might be jewelry, gold or other stuff. -Don't worry. Just run her over. -Yes, boss. Hey. What are you doing? This is worth millions! This'll pay for my mother's medication bill for months! If you had a truck, I'd help you myself. Now let's go. Dudun? Keys! Look, keys! Gino... So you can't tell the difference between car keys and house keys? No. Peasants! You think poverty gives you the right to be ignorant. -What's wrong? -We heard crying... Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am. What's wrong? I don't feel well all of a sudden. Maybe you're right, I should have stayed at home. Let's go home, ma'am. No! Keep watching the movie. -I'll just go home. -It's okay, ma'am. I'd rather go home with you. Now, now. Besides, it's only once a week you get to hang out with the others here, right? -Right. -Go and watch with them. Cecep can take me home. Are you sure? Thank you, ma'am. I'll get Cecep for you. Cecep! Come here! Take Mrs. Suzzanna home. All right. Take care, Cecep. Yes, ma'am. Take care, ma'am. Bye, now. Dudun! Where is Gino? Over there! Hey, come on! Wait a second. Where are Satria's car keys? -Can't find them. -Well, keep looking! I've looked everywhere! Hey! Someone is coming. We have to hide. Hide! Gino! Hide! Just cover your face! Umar! Umar, someone is coming! Jonal, I forgot the crowbar! One hundred, right? -Thank you, ma'am. Good night. -Yes, good night! -Thanks to your dating, it's now raining! -One's got nothing to do with the other! We're going to get struck by lightning. Hurry up! All right! Jeez. What are you doing? Ew, you smell! What are you talking about? Tohir smells so bad! Whatever, I want to stay warm! Jonal? I'm thirsty. -What are you doing? -Taking care of her. She's alone, Jonal. She's going to cause trouble. Calm down! Come on. Get her. Where are you going to go? Come here, you! Where are you going? Calm down. Come here! Jonal, don't! Are you all right? What do you mean, don't?! She saw my face, now she's seen yours. Even if she didn't see our faces, I won't risk her recognizing us. Does she recognize us? It's useless! If she's seen one of us, she's seen all of us! So what do you want to do now? You want to let her go? You want to let her call the police? And what if Satria finds out? Oh, God. That bastard would call the police. I don't want to lose my job, let alone get thrown in prison. I don't want to go to prison, I don't want to! I told you! Don't let anything happen to Suzzanna! It was your job to stop her! Who would have thought she could easily defeat you? -And what about you? -Hey, she hit me with a stone. Enough! Why are we even fighting?! You told me I'm here to keep her safe. And now you want us to go to prison? You really think she loves you so much that she wouldn't turn you in? Look! She's running! Ma'am. Wait. Don't! Where are you going? Dudun. You killed her, Dudun. It wasn't me, it was an accident. You saw it, right? You saw it, right? It wasn't me. I swear I didn't mean to. You saw it, right? Hey, let's take her to the hospital! She's still moving! -Let's take her to the hospital. -Don't be stupid! I don't want to go to prison. I don't want to go to prison. Let's run! Run! Shut up. Shut up! We should run! You shut up! Nobody is going to prison. Gino. Go back and clean up the house. Gino! The others will help bury Suzzanna. We have to make the disappearance of Suzzanna as natural as possible, as long as we can. Well, carry her! Hey, don't just stay still. Hey! She's still alive, her eyes are open. Look! So? You want to take her to the hospital? You want to go to prison? -Hurry up! -Move aside. Keep going. Keep going! -Her hand. Her hand! -Dudun, quickly. Come on, Dudun. Dudun, we don't have much time! Hello, honey. Are you awake? I called last night but nobody answered. Hello, honey, are you there? Did you just wake up? Honey, what's wrong? You're not mad at me, are you? I promise I'll come home as soon as I finish work. I will wait for you at home. Ma'am, what's wrong? Mrs. Suzzanna? It's okay. It's just a nightmare. Should I get you a glass of water? No need. Yes, ma'am. I'll be going then. Stop messing around, we're getting to the scary part. Why is this one so scary? This isn't scary. Sundel bolong tales are much more frightening! Sundel bolong? Right, sundel bolong is an old urban legend. If a pregnant woman dies, she becomes a sundel bolong, because she's not only bearing her own death, but also the death of the baby inside her. That's why she turns into a strong vengeful spirit. But she can hide her true form? All ghosts can hide their true form, using their own power. But when they are weak, they'll show their true forms again. Why are there ghosts in this world? -She popped up out of nowhere. -When did you come, ma'am? Because they have unfinished business in this world. That's what people say. Well, I personally think that spirits shouldn't meddle with our world. Especially with vengeance. Getting revenge always ends badly. I'm the total opposite, Rojali. If someone makes a ghost out of me, I will kill all of them. To stop their evil deeds. So they will all die. Who cares? Mrs. Suzzanna? One, two, three. Enough. I should sleep. Help! -Help me! -Calm down! -Please help me. -Why are you shouting? It's because of that ghost! That ghost! She has a hole in her back, her hair is long! She was here, she's a sundel bolong! There was a sundel bolong here! -Dudun... -It's true! -You're being weird. -She was here. She was here earlier. Her face. Get your act together. I'm not lying! I-- Her face... looks like... Mrs. Suzzanna. How is it, sir? Hey, Dudun! Be careful! You're sleepy. Thank you. I couldn't sleep. I haven't had any sleep since last night. Why not? Don't tell me it's because of that ghost. It's true. Every time I close my eyes, I see the sundel bolong! -It looks like Suzzanna! -Shut up! When I was little, my aunt used to scare me. She'd tell me stories about sundel bolong. What? -What now, Dun? -What if-- What if... Suzzanna was pregnant when she was killed? Listen. Listen! I'm warning you! Don't let anyone be suspicious of us. Understand? Do you understand? But I'm telling the truth. It's true. I keep seeing her every time I close my eyes. It's true. Who is it? Dudun! Oh, hang on a second! Hi. Dudun. This is Maya, Jonal's favorite masseuse. We notice that you've been feeling tired. I am. -I feel really tired. -All right then. Maya can help you with that. This is on the house, right? When have you ever paid for anything? Now go. Make him feel good. -But-- -All right then, thank you! Thank you. Thanks! Your muscles are so tense. Let me give you a back rub. Foreplay? Well, why not. -I'll be right back. -Okay. I'm going to get a glass and a bowl. -For the oil. -Okay. -I'll be right back. -Okay. Don't take too long! You can do it. You can, Dudun. -Hello? -Yes? -I'm going to start now. -Okay. Maya, can you do it gently? I prefer it gentle. Ouch! If it hurts, that means you may have a cold. -Hang in there. -Oh, I will! Ouch! Maya! Why does it feel like you're using a knife? Ouch. You will feel better in a moment. Oh, right. How did you end up with a cold? It's all right, you can tell me. Ouch! You won't believe me if I tell you, Maya. Ouch! I haven't been getting any sleep lately. Ouch! Because I'm being haunted by a vengeful spirit. Are you sure? Yes. I'm really sure! Who is the spirit? And why are you being haunted? Ouch! That hurts, Maya. Hello? Open up! Why is it locked? Suzzanna! It's Suzzanna! Suzzanna? Mr. Satria's wife? Suzzanna, I saw Suzzanna. -Quiet. -It's Suzzanna! -Shut up! -Suzzanna. -I saw her. I saw Suzzanna. -Are you out of your mind, Dudun? No! I swear I saw Suzzanna. She has turned into... a sundel bolong! I swear! -I'm telling the truth, I swear! -Calm yourself down, Dudun. If you keep acting like this, you'll end up paying for it. Do you understand? Say Suzzanna one more time, and I will kill you myself! I swear! Here, take a look at my back. It's all bloody. Look! There is nothing on your back! It's just your imagination, Dudun. The more afraid you are, the more you are haunted by your own thoughts. Face it, Dudun! Even if you are seeing a ghost, why would you be so scared? Mia. I just heard a weird thing from the neighbors! What weird thing, Tohir? There's a worker from the factory who saw a sundel bolong. He said it looked like Mrs. Suzzanna! -A ghost of Mrs. Suzzanna? -Yes! All the people in the village already know about it! It could be true! Haven't you noticed that Mrs. Suzzanna is acting weird lately? She isn't even up yet, still in her room. It's just hearsay, Tohir. What if it's true? What's wrong with him? He's choking! I'm over here dying and you guys just kept talking. Why didn't you tell us you were choking? How could I tell you? I was suffocating. -Sorry. -Stop saying sorry. Tohir, is that story true? About someone being haunted by Mrs. Suzzanna's ghost? Yes, that's what they said. If you think about it, it's kind of funny. If it really is Mrs. Suzzanna, that means we've been living with a ghost. -So we are the helpers of... -A ghost! Don't point at me! Why are you being so handsy all of a sudden? -Stop shoving yourself like that! -I'm scared! What are we going to do? What is it? Come on, man, wake up. Wake up. Come on. Dudun? Dudun? Dudun? Where? Where are you? Dudun? Can you see me? Come here, Dudun. Come here. Dudun. Dudun? Dudun, come inside! Where are you? Where? Come over here and play with me! Dudun! Where are you? It wasn't me! It wasn't me, I'm sorry! Please, forgive me. It wasn't me! Please. Right here, stop. Come on. -This one? -Yes. Who is it? It's Gino. I'm with my friends. How are you, Uncle? You haven't visited in a while. Yes, because mom is still sick. What can I do for you? It's like this, Mr. Turu, we came here to... I guess he lives up to his name. Suzzanna! You killed her! She has become a sundel bolong! -What did you do, Gino? -But... We didn't mean to. But still! You meant to harm her! Excuse me, sir. You mentioned sundel bolong earlier. What is it, actually? It's one of the ghosts with the most anger. That makes it one of the strongest ones, too. She can blur the human senses. And she can also meddle in our world. The stronger the ghost, the stronger they can manipulate and use their world and ours. So what does she want? What else if not revenge? Sir... -Just leave him be. -Sir? Sir. -She's also waiting for her husband. -He knows. A ghost cannot kill. If it kills, it will be sent straight to its world. It can only scare people. Convince people to kill themselves. -Or kill each other. -Dudun... But rest assured, she will come for you. Nothing is scarier than a ghost that seeks vengeance. Uncle, please help us. What do we do if Suzzanna comes? If she comes, hold this. She won't be able to touch you. Not for free. Yes, sir. If you should lose me and your child, would you be ready? What do you mean, honey? Of course I wouldn't be. Will you? Never. What's bothering you, honey? I hope... I will never lose moments like these. Jonal. Jonal! Umar. Gino! Did you hear that? Jonal. Jonal. Jonal. Where are you? Jonal! That's Gino! Jonal! I just want... my mom to be healthy again. Gino! So, what should we do? What did Mr. Kasan say? It's true! What is? Mrs. Suzzanna is a ghost. A sundel bolong. -Are you sure? -Mr. Kasan seems sure. He saw it himself, he said. The point is, I am leaving this house tonight. If you think about it, the villagers love to gossip. Especially Mr. Kasan. Besides, we've never really proven that Mrs. Suzzanna is a ghost. That means we have to really prove it. Right. I have a plan for us to be sure. How? Let's wait until she falls asleep. Then we meet up. Tell Mia to come, too. Have a drink. What is this? A shroud taken from a dead person. According to myth, this is the easiest way to see a ghost. We just cover our head with it, and then we can see ghosts. Where did you get it? From Abe, the undertaker. All right. You're wearing it, right? Why me? I'm the oldest one here. It works best if the wearer is younger. I can't do it. My skin is sensitive. Not to mention that it's dirty. Besides, to the best of my knowledge, shrouds work best with old people. -Their age is closer. -To the grave. You say that like you're immortal. I have another idea. Hey, Mia. Mia, come on. Yes! What if she wakes up? Then just tell her you're waking her up to pray. That's why it must be you. Mia, make sure this mirror is in front of her face. If she is a sundel bolong, the mirror will show it. Go on. Go on. Get in there. Open the door. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Ghosts don't sleep. Whatever. She's not a ghost. How do you know ghosts don't sleep? Are you friends with ghosts? Hurry up! We have to find out! Come on, Mia. Don't worry, I'm here. Slowly! Sir! It's fine, she's just stretching. Go on, go forward. Steady. Slowly. Steady. Reach for it! It's under there. Go. Keep going! I can't reach it! Go help her. Help her! Help her. Go. What is it? I got it. Mia, stop grabbing me, I'm not your pet. Dragging me like I'm your stepson. -Don't go too far. -Ouch. Your hand, Mia. Your hand. You're stretching out my shirt. Ma'am? Where is she? Where are you going? Ma'am. I want to ask for permission to go home. My wife is sick. Didn't your wife pass away? Yes, I mean I wanted to visit her grave. Ma'am. I also want to visit my mom's grave. Isn't your mom still alive? I mean, I want to visit my mom. I don't want to lose her. Ma'am, as for me, I want to visit grave visitors. I mean... Right, Mia? Run away. Run! -Why am I going inside the room? -Excuse us, ma'am! -Bag! -Your bag is in my way! Here you go, sir. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Tohir? Tohir? How are you, darling? I missed you so much. Me too, honey. And I miss the baby, too. Can you hear what the baby is saying? The baby says you smell. You haven't showered. How was your trip? Exhausting. How are you? I'm fine. Honey. Wake up. Let's pray. Honey. Let's go. You go ahead. I don't feel well today. Go and pray at the mosque. Why? I'd rather pray here if you're not coming. It's more rewarding if you pray there. -Sir, I will see you later. -Oh, see you later. Mr. Satria! Mr. Naryo? It's been a while. Yes, sir. I just got back from a trip overseas. I had to leave for work. Where's Mrs. Suzzanna? She's not here? Not this time, ma'am. She's exhausted. We went out yesterday. We haven't seen Mrs. Suzzanna in a while. Really? Doesn't she pray here every morning? It's been a week since she last came. Maybe it's because of the unpleasant stuff people say about her. What stuff? Didn't she tell you? Not yet. Actually, this isn't the right place to tell you. But since you asked... There have been two people who died because people say they were haunted by Mrs. Suzzanna. There were witnesses too. Haunted? My wife is doing fine at home, ma'am. That's the thing. Well, you did ask earlier. All right, we'll be going now. -We'll see you later. -See you later. -Let's go. -See you later. Gino is dead? Sir. Please help us. We beg you. Please help. If my charm doesn't work, that sundel bolong must be very strong. Whatever you ask for, we will give you. -Yes, sir. -But please help us. Here... We have some money. You can take this. -You can have this. -I don't need your money! You think money can bring back my stupid nephew? That sundel bolong has forgotten her place. And now, Gino has fallen victim. Then... Then what should we do? We don't want to become victims, too. Please. Please help us. If you want to survive, we have to destroy the sundel bolong. How do we do that? Sir. How? There are two things about the sundel bolong. First, the house. The house that is still there makes the spirit have a place to stay. Second, her husband. The love from her husband makes her have the power to go against her fate. That means the sundel bolong will be destroyed if we burn the house and kill her husband? Everything has a ritual. What do you mean? Her husband has to be killed in front of the sundel bolong. If not, killing her husband will only make her even angrier! We might be able to destroy the house, but... killing her husband in front of the sundel bolong sounds hard, sir. I have a plan. Your wife is dead. Her body is buried behind your house. Next to the jasmine plant. Who is this? My identity is none of your business. You just need to know that I'm telling the truth. You really want me to believe you? Let's meet up. If you want me to believe you. Why do you think your helpers left your house? And when was the last time you saw your wife praying? You're home? Yes, honey. What's wrong? You seem to be burdened with thoughts. Did Mia, Tohir, or Mr. Rojali tell you when they are coming back? No. There has been some unpleasant news lately. About our family. It makes me wonder. Were Mia and the others affected by that news? What news? I don't know what's going to happen. It's best we read the Quran before dusk to ask for guidance from God. So that any harm that may come our way will be stopped. Let's go. -But... -Come on, honey. I have a strong feeling something bad is coming for our family. The sooner we pray for help, the better. No. It's not Suzzanna. No, no. No, it's impossible. Impossible. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry. I should have been there for you. I should have protected you. What happened to you? Let's go! Let's go, sir! Get her out! Save this village! Let's go! Let's go! What's going on? Let's get that sundel bolong out of this village. Let's go! Sir, let's go! -Come on! -Get it out! Let's go. Satria? Who are you? Go away! -I'm Suzzanna, your wife. -No. You're not my wife. My wife is dead. Leave! I'm Suzzanna! No. You're not Suzzanna. Suzzanna isn't a ghost! Suzzanna isn't a murderer! -Suzzanna isn't a liar! -No! I'm not. -Go away! -No! Satria! Satria! I didn't mean to lie to you. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Leave! You don't belong here! I don't want to leave you. I don't want to be away from you. Satria. Open the door. Satria. Satria. I don't want to be away from you. Sundel bolong! Go back to your own world. Nobody wants you here. A bastard like you should never exist. Where did you go? You think you can stop me with that salt? Now, you die. Mr. Turu, hurry! Mr. Turu! There is a song of the night For strength and safety From all that hurts Curse on all the demons Who dare to come close Do not come close unless you want death This is a weapon from fire and water Now you're going to die! Get out! You're mine now, sundel bolong! Get her out of here! Get her out of here! Stop! What's going on? We want the sundel bolong out of this village! Get her out! Get her out of here! Calm down! She's gone! I've told her to go. Lies! -You're hiding her. -Hey! If you don't believe me, go look for yourself! Burn the house down! Sir, let's go. It's too late. Come on! Suzzanna is still here, sir. Sir! Her spirit still wanders. What really happened, Umar? I will tell you everything. But now, we have to get her to leave. We know someone who can get her back to her realm, sir. But the ritual cannot be done without you, sir. I don't want to see her again. -I've lost everything because of this! -I know. But if her spirit still wanders, there will be more misfortune to come, sir. Mr. Turu? This way. Mr. Turu? Have a seat. Please have a seat, sir. You only need to sit quietly and do nothing. The sundel bolong is evil and cunning. She will say anything to shake your resolve. Don't listen to her words. Remember. She is not your wife. She is a demon disguised as your wife. Over here, sir. By the merciful God! Satria? You have to leave quickly. Quick, leave! These are the people who killed me. Don't listen to her. Let's go. Let's go. Over here. You have to believe me. Our child and I are their victims. I don't want you to be another victim. Leave this place now! Keep your eyes shut until the ritual is over. Don't listen to the sundel bolong. Your presence alone is enough to weaken her. There is a song of the night For strength and safety From all that hurts Curse on all the demons Who dare to come close Do not come close unless you want death This is a weapon from fire and water Satria! You have to leave now! Hurry. Leave this place. They are going to kill you. Satria. -Look into my eyes. -Shut up! You are not my wife! I am your wife. In life and in death. If you really love me, look into my eyes. Before I leave this world. Satria, pull the kris dagger out of my head. No! There has been so much pain that you have brought upon me and my family. The time has come for you to regret it! Let's finish them. Mr. Turu! Cast your spell! Mr. Turu? Mr. Turu! Jonal? Mr. Turu! Why are you running away? Cast your spell on her! You fool! If the ritual failed, the only way for her to disappear is if she finishes all her business! Which is killing us! How stupid of you to fight me alone, Satria. You're the stupid one, for ruining my family! There is a song of the night For strength and safety from all hurt Thought it was wood instead of iron Curse all demons who dare come close Do not come unless you want death This is a weapon from fire and water There is a song of the night For strength and safety from all hurt Curse on all the demons Who dare to come close There is a song of the night For strength and safety from all hurt Curse on all the demons Who dare to come close Do not come unless you want death This is a weapon from fire and water Does it hurt? You can never run away from me. Damn you, Satria. Next will be your ears. You will be a mute, deaf, and blind witchdoctor! Die, Satria. Jonal. Are you ready to die, Jonal? Jonal? Help! Have mercy! Please let me out. Please let me out. Let me out! This time, don't think you can run away. I don't want to die. Please. I'm sorry. You're already dead. Since the night you buried me and my child alive! Wait! If you kill me, you will return to your world. Separated from Satria. Please. But... if I let you go, my husband will never be safe. No, help! Please! Suzzanna! My love! My love! My love. Satria, forgive me. Forgive me for putting you in danger. No, my love. It's me who's sorry. I'm sorry for hurting you. I wasn't able to protect you and our child. It's not your fault. I just wish we had more time. I have to go. Goodbye. But I don't want to part with you, love. Our worlds are different. I'm sorry. No, my love. Don't. I don't want you to go. It's all right. As long as you're by my side, I'm ready. What would I do without you, my love? I love you, Satria. I love you too, my love.
