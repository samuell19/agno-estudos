Do people really wait in line to have their pictures taken with porn stars? That's so weird. - How does that feel, you know? [Ben] What? - The words "porn star"? How does that... How does that feel? Being a porn star? - I mean, I don't know. And it's like, I don't... I don't really give a fuck what other people think, you know? - Yeah, I hear you.

'Cause I don't wanna get pulled over and I have to, you know. - I'm just making a quick stop on the way home. - What? [engine starts] [soft music] [insects chirping] [brakes squealing] Is that your cousin? - Uh, no, I guess it's her friend, I think. [Ben] You think? [Dom] I don't know. - Are you Dom? - Yeah. Who are you? - A friend of your cousins. I'm Alice. - Ah, you're the girlfriend. [Alice] Yeah. - Uh, Where's Didi? - Asleep, she's in the car. - Uh, well, this is kind of between me and her. Um... I gonna check up on her. - Actually, this is between you and me. It's my run. She just put us in touch. - I just wanna say hi, so, I think I'm gonna go walk over there. - Well, did you hear me? I said that she's resting. She's not feeling well right now. - Yeah, I heard you. Just gonna say hi. [crickets chirping] Didi. Oh man, Dee, what the fuck? What the fuck did you take, Dee? What'd she take? - I told you, okay? She needs her rest, okay? She's not feeling well. - You told me... [chuckles] You told me she's sleeping and she's right there, up. - Look, she drank too much, okay? - I know what drinking too much looks like. [Alice] It's fine. [Dom] That's not drinking too much. What's she on? [Alice] Do you want your money or what? - Yeah. - You do? - Yeah, I want the money. - Okay, great. - Mm-hmm. - Because you know, if you don't want your money, I have someone coming in tomorrow, all right? They can come down and do the run for me. They're more than happy to do it. Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Okay, good. Introduce me to your friend. [Ben] Is everything okay? - Everything's fine. - Hi. - This is my friend, Ben. - Hi. What's going on? - This is the porn star boyfriend? - Come on. This... We're friends. - All right, whatever you want. [phone ringing] Hold on. This is Alice. Yeah, no, I understand. Um... - Surprise! [Alice mumbling] Look, I just wanted to send you off to California with a little bit of cash, all right? [Alice] Yeah, I got it. - It's just a package for a friend. - Drugs? [Dom] You don't know anything about this. Just get back in the truck. - Yes, I do. Now I do know. - You're not supposed to, man. Just relax. - Come on boys, I don't have all night. [sighs] - Where we meeting up at? - So... [sighs] When you cross... - Yeah. - ...the first little town, when you cross the border. - It's Canoose, I know. - Yeah. Good. So that you know, once you go through that town, there's gonna be a little rest stop right before you get to the 24. [Ben] I know it. - Of course you know it. - What the fuck does that mean? - No judgment. What is your cell service? [Dom] My cell service, she wants my cell service. Um... - What is it? What, what cells do you have? - It's on that cell. - Okay, all right. Well, that's gonna be fine. Check your phone. So when you get to the rest stop, okay, and you finish all of the business, you're gonna text me and then I'll pick you up. Okay? - Okay. - You sure? - We're good. I'm sure. [Alice] Okay, all right, now for the fun part. [Dom] How long is this thing gonna take? You know, I already don't want to be waiting there long. - Well, that's up to you. All right, come over here, I don't bite. - You know, you could just give me the whole box. [Alice laughing] - She didn't tell you, did she? [Dom] Tell me what? I don't... - They go down the hatch before they make the trip. - Come on, fuck you. Come on, that wasn't part of the deal. - What do you think, you're just gonna shove it in your shoe or in the glove compartment? No fucking way. We do it my way or nothing. - No way I'm doing it. [Alice] Oh, come on. - No, no, I'm serious. Fuck you, we didn't agree to that shit. I'm not doing it. [Alice sighs] No way. Ben, let's get outta here, man. Deal's off. [phone ringing] - This is Alice. Mm, yeah. [Ben] What the fuck are you doing? [Dom] I don't... this wasn't supposed to happen, all right? [vehicle dings] What a fucking bitch. - Okay, let's just go. I don't need the money. Let's just go. - Ah, fuck, man. Fuck. - Dom, I appreciate it. - I'm sorry. - Listen up, you're not backing out now, okay? It's too fucking late for that. - All right. Relax. We can figure this out. You don't have to go fucking crazy on us. - Open it up. Come on, now! Okay, you see these? These need to be kept at the exact right temperature. You fuck that up, that is a non-negotiable. You get nothing. You understand that? - Just... [Alice] All right, down the hatch, come on. [sighs] - All right, just hang on. We can figure this out. - No. It's already been figured out, so... Bon appetit. Come on. - All right, I'm doing it. [Alice] Good. [Ben] You don't have to do this. - Yes, he does. [sighs] All right, let's keep going. Now, I want you to listen up, okay? So when these come out the other end, I want you to be fucking careful, okay? Nobody wants them getting torn, least of all you, honey, okay? So you help him. You be gentle. It is very important that they don't get damaged. Keep going. - Just... [uneasy music] - All right. - Good. And I want you rinse them off, okay? I don't wanna 'em to smell like shit. Nice warm water, nice and gentle. Not hot. Not cold. Warm water. And when you're done, put 'em in this box. I'm gonna give you the box. There's two hand warmers in there, okay? - I hear you. [Alice] Put 'em in there with the hand warmers, close 'em up. - All right. It's not fucking rocket science, all right? Put 'em in two hand warmers, I get it. - Okay, good. [Dom groans] All right, we're almost done. You're doing good. - Fuck you. [Alice] You're welcome. Keep going. [Dom] Fuck, Dee. [vomit splattering] Dee! Shit. - You. [Dom] God, Dee... - What? [indistinct chatter] No. - Yes. [Ben] Please, I don't wanna. - Just do it exactly like I say, okay? You're gonna be fine. Come on, let's go. [uneasy music] Good, and again. Come on. There's one more left. - What's going on over there? [Alice] Come on, let's go, go, go, go. - Hey. Hey, what the fuck are you doing? [Alice] Shh. - What are you doing? Damn it. Give me that. This has nothing to do with him. - Oh, well it's a little too late for that. [coughing] - Where's the last one? - Oh, that's already been taken care of. And he didn't gag either. You should have seen him. - What, what does that mean? - So after they're out, rinse, nice, warm, gentle. You put 'em in the box. You're gonna text me. Just something sweet, like a heart emoji, okay? - What about the money? - When the packages are delivered, safe and warm, it's all yours. No big deal. All right, and don't stop on the way, okay? Straight to the rest stop. [breathing heavily] [sniffling] - Tell me you didn't. [Ben] I didn't really have much of a choice. - Fuck. I'm so sorry. This all went to shit. - Do you even know what's inside those things? [distant engine starting] - I don't want to know. - Oh my God. - I'm fucking sorry. - Yeah, you already said that. So let's just go and get this over with. Start the car, let's go. [engine starting] [vehicle dinging] [Dom] This had nothing to do with you, man. - Well, now it does. [Dom] I'm fucking sorry. - You already said that. [Dom] I'm so fucking sorry. - You already said that. - Yeah, I know, but I'm fucking sorry! - Okay! - It wasn't supposed to happen. [horn honking] - Let's go! [tense music] [brakes squealing] [sighs] [insects chirping] [brakes squealing] - Were you two headed tonight? - We're just heading home. - What's the reason for your visit? - He took me dancing. - Any possession of any alcohol or cigarettes? - No, ma'am. - You been drinking? - I have, just a little. [chuckles] - I'm driving. - I'll be right back. [sighs] [Agent] Okay, here you go. You two have a nice night. [Ben] Will do. - Drive carefully. - Thank you. [soft music] [insects chirping] How's your stomach? - Fuck that, I don't want your money. [sighs] - You knew you could come with me. [scoffs] - To LA? - Mm-hmm. - I think they're paying for you, not your fucking burned out friend. - Yeah, but you could get a job. You could find an apartment. - This is all about you. You can do so good, man, I know it. - Yeah. 'Cause I'm so good at getting fucked in the ass and letting strangers cum on my face. - It's how fucking sexy you are when you do it. You're gonna have hundreds of thousands of people just watching you, wanting to get off on you, dreaming about you, wishing they got a piece of you. [scoffs] - You think I'm sexy? - Yeah, you know, the only reason we haven't fucked is because I love you too much. - Yeah, and you're straight. - Fuck that. I care more about you than I ever did Lacey, Trisha, Libby, any of 'em. [chuckles] [sighs] [clears throat] - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm gonna run inside. I don't wanna shit on myself. - All right. [door slams] [sighs] [sighs] [vehicle approaching] [vehicle door slams] - Hey, is that you? - Who the fuck you expecting? - I'm sorry, I thought... I thought you was someone else. [flatulence] [spitting] [groans] [Ben] How's it going in here? [Dom] It's been better. Who the fuck was that? - I don't know. Some redneck. [sighs] Nothing? - Nope. Nothing. I just want these things out, man. [Ben] I know. Okay, well just be careful. [redneck] This who you waiting for? Fucking faggots. - We're... We were just... - Relax. We're just talking in here, all right? - Is that what you call it? Why you so scared if you're not doing nothing? - Please just... Can you just leave me alone? [Dom] Hey, hey, hey. - Or what? Huh? You wanna suck my dick too? - No. - I bet you like that. What are you gonna do? - Why don't you leave him the fuck alone? - What are you gonna do about it, big boy? - You have no idea what you're talking about, man. - Stay the fuck away from me, you fucking queer. [Ben] Dom, let's just go. - No, this guy is being fucking asshole. - Am I? - Yeah, you are. [groans] - Keep it to your fucking selves next time! [ominous music] [grunts] [Ben] Are you okay? [ominous music] [air hissing] - What are you gonna do when I'm not around to protect you, huh? - Guys like that don't live in LA. - Guys like that live everywhere. [engine starting] [grunts] [tires screeching] - Is your stomach okay? - What do you think? - Stop fucking around! My God! - I was kidding. [Ben] I'm telling you to stop kidding! - Relax. All right? You got the punch... for a fat boy. [electricity buzzing] [breathing heavily] Ow. [groaning] Ah! Ah! - What, what? Okay, okay. - Oh, fuck. - Come here. Come sit down. - Ah, but the floor-- - Sit down. - Fucking nasty. [groaning] [uneasy music] [shouting] [Ben] Give me your phone. - I'm sorry. - Dom, give me your fucking phone. - No. - Why?! - I'm not letting you call anybody, all right? You're not getting fucked because of my stupidity. - I don't care about that. We need to get you to a hospital. - I'm fine. - You're not fine. Give me your phone. [groaning] What do I do, what do I do, what do I do? I dunno, I dunno what to do. [groaning] [uneasy music] - What the fuck is that? Get the fuck off. Get off. [uneasy music] [breathing heavily] - Okay, it didn't break when it came out, right? So that's a good thing, right? [Dom groaning] Right? - I can't feel my legs. - What? - I can't feel my legs. - You're, you're just cold, okay? Just sit there, I'll be right back. [uneasy music] [electricity buzzing] [groaning] [breathing heavily] Okay. We're going to a hospital. [engine starting] Just breathe. [Dom panting] [revving] What the fuck? Fuck! Okay, you texted her, right? - I think another one's coming, man. - Okay, all right. I'm gonna call 911 then. I don't know what else to do. - Ow... [groaning] - Hi, um, my friend, he... he took something and, and... [continues speaking indistinctly] I don't know. Okay, we're... we're at a... at a rest stop right outside of Canoose. Can you send someone? - Who the fuck are you calling? Give me that. - I, he-- - Why the are you calling the cops? Get the outta the car. - He needs a hospital. - What happened to your tires? - I, I-- - Fucking idiot. - Where the fuck are his pants? [Ben] I, I... [panting] - What the fuck happened? - He-- - Tell me exactly what fucking happened. - He got punched in the stomach, and, and-- - How the fuck did he get punched in the stomach? - There was some guy, I don't know. He got punched and-- - How hard? [Ben] Bad and-- - Fuck. - And then those things started coming out of him and-- - Okay, slow down. Did the bag break? - When it came out, it wasn't broken. - Where are they? [Ben] They're in, in the, the... - Yeah. Get the ice box. Get the fucking cooler. Hey, Dom. All right, I just need you to calm down. Okay, keep breathing through this. - Fuck you, man. - Get him in my Jeep and try to get his fucking pants on and I'll be right back. [Ben] What are those things? - I'll tell you all about it on the way to the fucking hospital, but he needs your help right now and so do I. [groaning] [Dom] Oh, man. - Okay, come here. Just come with me. - All right, all right. - Okay. Hey. Okay, come on. Okay. Look at me. - I'm scared. - I know. I know. It's okay. We're gonna go to the hospital and they're gonna take care of you, okay? I promise, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. All right? Okay. - What the fuck? - It's just some... sort of reaction. Here, let me just try and just get your pants back on. - Fuck my pants. Fuck my pants. I can't feel my legs. They're fucking numb. - It's okay. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. [door opens] [uneasy music] So you gonna tell us what they are? 'Cause they're not drugs. - Well, that's not true exactly. Do you ever hear of people licking jungle toads and shit to get high? - No. - Well, they do. People pay all sorts of fucking money for it, so... It's like that, it's just a little different. - So what are they then? - Bugs. [Ben] What kind of bugs? - I don't know exactly. I just know that when they hatch, the babies bite you, you get all sorts of fucked up. You're getting paid, aren't you? [uneasy music] [birds chirping] - Where are we? - Look, it's just a little pit stop before the emergency room. - I want the phone back. - We have to stop to drop those fucking off. I don't know if you forgot, but your boyfriend has a small fortune up his fucking ass. Okay, and I don't think my boss is gonna be very happy if they end up in some backwoods clinic, so... Okay, so get in. Let's go, let's go. It'll be fast, all right? It's gonna wear off in an hour anyways. [uneasy music] [phone vibrating] [uneasy music] Fuck. This is Alice. [uneasy music] Yeah. There with me. [sighs] Wait here. Okay. [Dom] Where the fuck are we? [Ben] I don't know. [Dom] It feels good too. - What? What does? - This, whatever this is. I can't move my legs, but... my dick's been hard for like an hour. - Yeah, I noticed. Do you think they like sell the bugs or... take the juice or whatever? - What about yours? - Nothing. But I didn't get punched in the stomach, so... - I was defending your honor. - All right, let's go. Come on. [Ben] Hey, hey, be careful. - Well then fucking help me. [groaning] [Ben] You okay? [groaning] - Are you gonna fucking help me or not? Are you gonna fucking help me or not?! - I'm not helping you with anything until tell me where the fuck we are. - We're at my boss's. We have to get all the fucking things out of him and then we can all go home. - Okay, then let me do it. - Fine, be my guest. [groaning] - You okay? [groaning] [Alice] Hurry up. [panting] Come on. [groaning] All right. - I thought you said it'd be worn off in an hour. - It's give or take. Plus we don't really know what's happening inside of there. - This is so fucked up. - It was his idea. [Ben] What are you talking about? - Dee said that he needed some money. He wanted it right away. God knows what he wanted it for. I mean, he wasn't forced into doing this. - You fucking pulled a gun on us. - I don't have to say shit to you, okay? I don't owe you anything. sit the fuck down and we're just gonna wait until he shits the rest out. Go. [sighs] [Dom groaning] [groaning] Does he know how in love with him you are? He must, right? [Dom groaning] [Ben] I have to piss. - Not in there, outside. There's an outhouse, but not for you guys. When you have to go shit... won't you go in here, okay? - Relax. I just have to pee. [door opens] - What the fuck are you doing? Oh, you've never seen an outhouse before. Get the fuck in here. [Ben] Hey, hey. How you doing? - I've been better. [phone ringing] - This is Alice. - Okay, all right. [Alice] I know. That's what we've been... [groans] Yeah, that's what we're fucking doing. I've been... Okay, I didn't know if you fucking kept it in the bathroom or not. Okay. Fuck! - Who was that? [Alice] You'll meet him soon enough. We have to get them out right now. - What? - You heard me. - Right now? - Yeah, right now. - But how, how are we...? - Help me. - Careful. - Fuck! - He's fine. - Let's just give it a minute, it'll come out. - We don't have fucking time for that. Okay?! Now, come on. Who's gonna fucking do this? - You, I want you to do it. Ben, I want you to do it. - Well good, you probably have more experience doing this kind of thing, so... - Fuck you. - Let's just fucking do this, okay? And get our money and get out of here. Okay, so get down and get your fucking hand in his ass. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! You don't want them fucking hatching in there, okay. - It's gonna be easier if you lay on your side. [Dom groaning] Just relax, just relax. The more you relax, the easier it'll be. [groaning] [coughing] [shouting] I'm sorry. [Dom shouting] - Put 'em in here. Nice and easy. [groaning] [groaning] All right. [groaning] You got it? [grunts] All right. Keep going. [birds chirping] Go on, go on, go on. - Okay, okay. I'm trying. [groaning] Oh fuck. [groaning] Okay, shh. Just try and breathe. It's okay, just relax. [Dom groaning] - Go, go, go, go, go. Come on. [door opens] [door closes] - All this bullshit and a real life sex show too. And such beautiful boys. - I thought you would notice. - Who the fuck are you? - Is he... bit? Oh fuck. - It was only one. We can it out of his pay. [Dom] No the fuck you won't. - Your payment is determined upon successful delivery, okay? - Only one. - Only one. - How many are there? - He's got three still and he's got one. - Well. I might just have to get that one... myself. Where did you find these two? - He's Dee's cousin. - Oh, Dee. Your cousin is a fucking whore who doesn't show respect when respect is due. - We're here. We have your shit. Just give us some money. We'll be gone. [laughs] - You will. Give me my gun. [uneasy music] My fucking gun! Continue. [uneasy music] - Please, can you just let me. - I said... continue. [uneasy music] [Dom panting] [groaning] [uneasy music] Sassy little things, aren't they? - They're just kids, Rich. - You know, sister... I think you can go now. - I mean, I don't mind. [Dom] Oh! - I mean, I can take this from here. [Dom] Oh! [Dom groaning] - Go. - I got one. - Ah... - Okay. All right, I'm going. Can I get my payment? - You will get your payment when I am finished with this. Next week when I see you. - Okay. [Dom groaning] - What's your name? - Benjamin. - Well, your name's scrumptious. You can get back in there. [uneasy music] [sniffing] [groaning] - Fuck! - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, look, I think you should just get outta here, okay? - What, are you fucking kidding me? No way am I leaving you here. - Hmm... Hmm... No, no, no, no, no. Careful. - You're crazy. - Please, just go. - No. They're fine. There's only one more, I can get it. - No, no, no. It is not fine. In 20 minutes, they'll be dead. And then they'll be useless to me. Nine goddamn years and none of this shit has ever happened. - Okay. Okay. There's only one more. I can just get it and then-- [Dom screaming] [screaming] [soft music] - What the fuck? Can you help him please?! - Move! [tense music] [coughing] - You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. [groaning] We need to get him to a hospital now, please! - Fuck! - What did you do?! Fuck. Okay, hey. Hey, come on. Come on, I'm right here. Hey, come on, come on, come on. We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Come on. Come on. [door opens] [Alice] What the fuck? [door closes] What happened? [Rich] I don't need your judgment. - Is he...? Rich, what the fuck? You can't just let shit like this happen! - This is on you as much as it is on anybody. You brought him in. So drop the judgemental bullshit. - Ugh, no one... No, one's judging you. You just... You seem a little upset. - I am upset. - Just calm down, okay? - Don't tell me to calm down! - Okay. I'm gonna take the kid and I'm gonna take him back into town, okay? - Oh. Oh, okay. I mean, that's because you're so good at your job. Obviously not. So no, no, no. God! [sighs] [Alice] Is he breathing? [Ben] Barely. - I'm gonna go talk to him. I'll be right back. You just stay here, okay? - Okay. [uneasy music] [water flowing] [Rich and Alice arguing indistinctly] I'm so sorry. [crying] [groaning] Dom? I, I thought that it... Hey, hey. - Hey. [Ben] I knew you weren't going anywhere. - It feels good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Shh. [Alice and Rich arguing] No. [crying] Come on, come on, you're okay. Come on, you're okay. Come on. You're okay, please, come on. Please, please don't leave me here. [gun shot fires] [uneasy music] - The bitch pulled a knife on me. Look, I know he's your friend. I get it. Nobody wanted it to happen like this. Nobody. Least of all me. Listen, I think that we should just... wrap all of this up and put it behind us. I dunno. [sighs] I need you to know... that I'm not a bad person. [uneasy music] I need to hear you say it. - You're not a bad person. - See, I'd never do nothing like that to you. Do you know what would be really nice? A hot bath. I think you would feel a thousand times better. I'm gonna make us a fire. [water flowing] [uneasy music] I got some real nice bath salts... that makes your skin feel so smooth. Well, I'm sure your skin is smooth, but it's still nice. You'll feel good. You know, I do apologize about this afternoon. It wasn't perfect, I know. But... she did attack me. [uneasy music] [sniffing] You're not gonna take a bath in those clothes, are you? [uneasy music] You're not gonna leave those on, are you darling? [uneasy music] Bath salts are in the cabinet. I'll be in in a minute. [sighs] [water flowing] Warm enough? - Yeah. [water flowing] - That water should help you get them things out. Are you hungry? I could make us some spaghetti. - Not hungry. [sighs] - Would you like a drink? I can make you... a Cabernet or a whiskey or vodka or a gin. Tequila. I could make you a cosmopolitan. - Whiskey's fine. - Okay. I'm gonna pull down the top shelf stuff for you. Cheers. Oh no. Let me do that. I would never take advantage of you. People took advantage of me. [sighs] You really are such a beauty, you know. - I'm moving to LA next week. - That town is going to eat you up. They're gonna love you. They're gonna lick their lips and then they're gonna come back for more. Mark my words. I lived in California for a while. This is a long time ago, but I loved it. I loved it. I had a friend who had a house in Palm Springs and he had a helicopter. Now how glamorous is that? Well, I wasn't a movie star or anything, but... I did share a line with Grace Jones at a disco club once. Oh God. Please tell me you know who Grace Jones is. You know, I met someone last week who didn't know who fucking Barbara Streisand was. Barbara fucking Streisand! [chuckling] Do you have a job lined up in California? A good job? I mean, you don't have to have it all figured out before you get there. - Well, that's what the money's for. - Right. Right. Have you ever been to Puerto Vallarta? I have a little house down there by the beach. - So what do you do with them? The bugs. - Oh. A friend of mine figured out how to milk them, but you have to do it when they're just hatched. I figured out how to lace the joints with them. Well, my business went up 10,000% when you didn't have to get bit to get high. - What does it feel like when they bite you? - Oh, it's a fucking head trip, but it's a full body experience too. The one thing I will tell you... is that it will keep your dick hard for a full nine hours. Not that you have any problem with that, I'm sure. But what's the point if you can't feel anything? - Oh, you can feel, you can feel everything. But you can't move. [uneasy music] - Think I'll have another one, please. - You can have anything you want. [ominous music] Would be a shame to cover you up. Well, I'd feel bad if I didn't offer you a towel. - I think I'll just dry off by the fire if that's okay. - That... would be lovely. So what's in LA? - Sunshine. [Rich chuckles] [Rich] Well, that's true. - The beach. [Rich] You know, main beaches just don't compare once you've been to Malibu. - I like main beaches all right. I think it's just time for a change, I guess. - You know, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were flirting with me. [ominous music] I'll take that. - You know, I think I have to pee. [uneasy music] [stomps] - I'll hold onto those for now. [uneasy music] And when you come back, we can see about getting yours out. [birds chirping] Hey, Benjamin! - I'm here. - Got a problem? [Ben] No problem. - Listen, I'm sorry about your friend. Honest to God I am. I don't wanna run my business that way. Now as for your deal with Alice, I don't know what it's all about. What I was thinking was... that I give you everything. Now, even with the bugs that you killed, gonna clear 15 grand. And I'm gonna give it all to you. We can put it behind us, not think about it again and you can go to LA. What do you think about that? - Okay. - Well, good. Then come on in. - Oh, I'd like the money now. - Oh, would you? Do you think I carry that kind of cash around? - Yeah, I do. - Look at you. Didn't you grow up fast. Come on. [uneasy music] - That's a nice jacket. Think I could try it on? - With pleasure. [Ben] I like it. - You know, I've had this jacket forever. Mother fuck! Fuck! [gun shot fires] [sobbing] [dramatic music] [truck alarm blaring] Where are you, you stupid cocksucker? You can't go anywhere. I got these! [alarm blaring] [alarm stops] You done dick teased the wrong queen, bitch. Missy. Come on out. Mommy's got something for you. [tense music] Where are you, you stupid cocksucker?! [tense music] [water flowing] [panting] [door closes] [weeping] [water flowing] [groaning] [uneasy music] [gasping] [groaning] [soft music] [birds chirping] [clattering] [grunting] [twig snapping] Benjamin? [sniffs] [ominous music] [sniffing] [dramatic music] Please, please, you don't have to do this. Don't do this, please. You don't have, you don't have to. - Shh, shh, shh. - I have money. I'll give it to you, I promise. Don't do that to me, please. - Shut the fuck up. - No, no, no. [uneasy music] - Look at me. Open your fucking eyes and look at me. - No. No. [tense music] [grunts] - Does that feel good? Yeah? Fuck you. [spits] [water flowing] [soft music] [grunting] - Hey, hey, you don't have to do this, Benjamin. I have money. I have everything. Anything you want to do, please don't do this. Please don't do this. You're gonna go to hell. You're gonna go to hell. Oh no, please. No! [Rich screaming] You motherfucking fag!
