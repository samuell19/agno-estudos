[MUSIC PLAYING] -This is Jerusalem over 150 years before the birth of Christ. Often invaded and occupied by foreigners, it has always been liberated by people miraculously faithful to the covenant made by the patriarch Abraham with his god. This is the temple, the heart of the city, where for centuries the voices of prophets resounded. Here are preserved the commandments, which God gave to Moses. But facing the temple stands the stronghold of earthly power, the Citadel. From here, many an invader has tested his power against the power of Lord. And it was here that years later the Roman Pontius Pilate presided at the trial of Jesus of Nazareth. But at the time of our story, Israel suffers under the yoke of the powerful Syrian King Antiochus. -I am not a thief. Please. -Filthy Hebrew, it takes a whip to keep you in line. -I have stolen nothing. -Make way for the guards of Apollonius. Make way. -You men have your orders. Go on. March on your labor. Get out on my way or I'll have you whipped to death like a dog. What? Are you hard of hearing? I'm speaking to you. You must have calluses on your eyes as well as on your hands. Put down that hammer, I tell you, before I lose my temper. -It seems to me you already lost it. -You're trying your best to provoke, aren't you. -If it's trouble you're looking for Syrian, you've come to the right place. -Well, I'm delighted to see that you would have changed a bit, Namel. -I can't believe my eyes. Judas. May the lord bless you and keep you. -Go back outside and keep on working. Have you got any clothes? -But of course, they're not much to look at but-- -For me, they'll do well enough. I had to put on this hated uniform to get safely into Jerusalem. Keep your eyes open. And you had better found a way on that anvil so that no one can over hear us. -Right. -Apollonius, the new governor, is about to arrive. We attacked some of his staff who are riding ahead. But we mustn't fool ourselves, however. Jerusalem is in for a bad time. Apollonius is cruel and our people need help. And that's the reason why I've come back. I'll alert the others and distribute the weapons. We'll meet in the square in front of the temple. -If you are with us, Judas, this there's nothing we can't do. -Help almighty God and show us again the path to final victory. Hey, what are you doing there? -Ah, leave that to me. There, are sword worthy of Judas Maccabeus. That other one was made of Syrian iron. -It's like a thunderbolt. -You are our only hope at salvation. The Lord bless and keep you, my son. -Go no. Go with the Lord. Do as I told you. -Come on, don't gather in the street. Move on, move on. -May the Lord purify your hands of the blood which has stained them, Judas. I can tell by your eyes that you bring violence with you. -Our brother expected a warmer welcome from you, father. -The enemies of Israel may prevail against Judas but not against the wrath of our almighty God. -Apollonius, the new governor King Antiochus is sending has the fury of a wild beast. This is why I am here. I mean to kill him before he can kill us. -Is it you, my own flesh, who preaches violence like this in the temple our Lord? Isn't it a sign of the flavor of the Lord that the invader is tolerant of our religion. -Evidently, Apollonious' reputation has not reached you yet. Once he's here, the last liberties you enjoy will cease. -Judas, as your father and as the high priest of the Lord, I order you not to raise arms within this city. -I'm not one to oppose his father's will, but some day you'll remember what I told you. -My son, I wonder if this zeal of yours is faith or fanaticism. -Father is right. -Welcome, home again, my brother. -I hear that you have chosen your friends among the enemies of our people. -Yes, you're quite right, Judas. Yet, if we continue to be so stubborn, it will only increase the hostility of the Syrians. Let me remind you that hatred breeds. -Let me remind you, that's no reason for us to love them. -You're wrong, Judas. I know that many Syrians are our friends. -Who keeps the company of idolaters. As well as base Syrians and pagan sinners profanes with his presence the sanctuary of God. -Very well, you believe in force and I believe in reason. I accept your opinion, but I will not renounce my principal. -The Syrians will make you see the truth. -Simon. -The Lord be with you. -Apollonius, the governor the Syrians have sent to destroy us. -Jonah, you'd better go and tell Namel. Hurry. -Judas, remember what I've told you and what you promised us. -I'll keep my word, father. -Take the horses away. Carry the weapons inside. -Namel. Namel. -What is it, Jonah? -All right, what is it. My father is absolutely against Judas. -What do you mean? -Our attack's called off. -That's impossible. I distributed all the weapons. We can't stop them now. -Judas is captain. No one isl to move unless he orders otherwise. But he did say to give out the weapons. -All right, quickly, hurry. Bring those things in here. Hurry. [DRUM BEAT] -Jakkar, where are the people of Jerusalem. -They must be gathered at the temple to receive you with full honors -Jakkar. -I know what you would ask, my lord. But I have no explanation to give you. -If this is a joke, they'll pay for it. And who is that fat pig? -The military commander of the garrison of Jerusalem. I received a full report on him at the court of King Antiochus. You'll find him a loyal aid who will carry out your orders. -Greetings and all honor to you, my dear, Apollonius. -You consider it an honor to receive me as if I had the plague? What a marvelous surprise I've been handed by the people of Jerusalem. Where are these Jews? -I swear by all the gods, they're going to pay for this, sir. -My horse. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Summon the high priest. -And what if he refuses to appear? -We'll teach him manners. -He's coming, sir. -Stranger, who are you to disturb an old men intent at his prayers? -I am the supreme authority who controls the fate of this city. -The people of Israel are more than ready to give joyful greeting to anyone who comes as a friend, but a friend does not arrive with an army at his back. -You're Mathathius, are you not? The high priest? -I am but the humblest servant of God. -I have heard about this god of yours. And the present I have brought him is a pledge or our earnest desire to cooperate with him. There is my present, Jove, father of the gods. He will live in the temple with your god as befits the father and a master. Move forward, take him in. -Move back, move back, idolaters. Take that pagan image of yours away from here. -Take it inside. -Stop, beware that you profane the threshold of the house of God. -I said forward. Move back, move back, I tell you. -Listen old man, sacrifice to Jove if you want us to respect your temple. Your hesitation is already an insult. -Draw your sword and put me to death for I am unworthy to be a servant of the Lord, but first remove that statue. -Who will honor Jove, the most powerful of the gods? The who sacrifices to him will be the new high priest. -We mustn't let them do it. -Keep quiet. -But he's your father. -They're trying to provoke us. The new governor is clever. -All right, who'll sacrifice. -I'll sacrifice to almighty Jupiter. -Nathaniel, you must not turn against our Lord, the god of the people of Israel. [MOANS] Let him go. -Who else of you darn to profane our sacred temple? -Take him inside. -Beware. Beware. Turn back idolaters. Depart you heathen. -Why don't you ask your god if he's able to stop the king of Olympus. -Save us oh God of Abraham. [SOUND OF ARROWS] [YELLING] -Israel. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Form a line. Stand fast men. -Right rank on your knees. Fix your arrows. Aim. -Cut that rabble to pieces. Bring them down. -Shoot -All together. -Fall back and take cover. Fall back. -After them. -We must stop them. Form a line. Hurry. [ROAR OF SOLDIERS] -Don't break ranks. Don't be afraid. Stand your ground. Attack them. -Mattathius. -Don't be afraid, Isaac. -For the glory of Israel. -Order a general retreat. -Trumpeter, sound a retreat. -Cover our retreat, Jakkar. -You men, follow me. -Look they are retreating. -They're heading to the governor's palace. -Namel will head them off. -Watch out. Here come some more of them. -Halt, you. -What do you want? -Let me pass. -Now I'm going to give you my sword. -Watch out, Judas. -Joshua. -May God you everlasting victory. -Judas, I've come to fight by your side, but it's wrong. -Keep your advice to yourself. -Listen to me. This persecution will never end and you will be the one responsible. -I'm surprised you're not wearing a Syrian uniform. -You speak the way you act. You want to kill for the pleasure of killing but it makes no difference to you who it is as long as you draw blood. -Let go of me, Simon. Let go of me and stay away from me or I'll cut your down. -Kill me and increase of glory. -Back away from me or I forget we are brothers. We don't speak the same language. -The Syrians are escaping to the palace. Namel will need men to help him. Better send Iliasar and John as well. But hurry. Stay away from me Simon. -Judas-- [GROANS] -What a beginning. As soon as we are reorganized, my time will come. -I see you managed without us, Namel. -They will never be able to get out of there alive. Come on. They're gathering at the square. -There our last prisoner. -Namel has Apollonius trapped in the palace with his whole garrison. -And they won't be coming out very soon. -Come on. [CROWD JEERING] -Father, my life is in your hands now. I failed to keep my promise. -Judas, I am proud of you. The house of the Lord was spared a sacrilege. And we owe this to you. And now harken to me, people of Israel, the enemy will return in force to destroy us. And you cannot withstand their vengeance if you remain here. Therefore, another exodus is forced on us. Leave Jerusalem to the enemy and once again carry the commandments so that they will not be profaned. God of the Israelites show thy loving kindness to us wandering in the wilderness as you did in the days of Moses and Joshua. Let they name be praised now and forever. Judas will be our leader. [CROWD CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Listen to them shouting. -Lord, give us the order to attack. We'll massacre them. -Idiot. That means fighting blind in a city where they know each alley, each corner, or each window, each wall might conceals a nest of archers. It's sheer madness. No, let them enjoy their day of triumph. Tomorrow, we'll attack at daybreak, we'll attack with all our forces. And house to house, we'll smoke them out. Take their sons hostages to work for us. They will obey. They will obey if I have to spread fire and slaughter throughout the whole of Jerusalem. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Now, don't cry there. Now, don't worry, dear. Drive on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Brother. -Well? -Is everything clear? I'll be the last to leave the city after you have to get time to get away. My task is to cover your retreat. May the good Lord be with you. -Don't worry about us. -Good luck, Judas. -Come on. Move along. No straggling. Keep moving. -Father. -Judas will over take us on the road. We're going to the oasis of Ben Yosef. John and the others in his group are going to head directly for Jericho. -Good-bye, father. -No, Jonathan, you stay here and wait for Judas. Good-bye, father. We'll be waiting for you at Jericho. -Good-bye, father. -Mattathius, what is to become of us. -The good Lord will protect us, Leah. Drive on. -Good-bye, Mother. -Good-bye. -Let us through. -Take care of yourselves. Close up. Keep moving. -Jonathan? Aren't you coming along? -We'll see each other in Jericho. -I love you, Jonathan. You know that. -I love you, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, what news have you brought me. -The worst of new. Apollonius means to bend Jerusalem to his will and show no mercy. -There'll be a massacre. -The Israelites and their families who took part in the revolt are fleeing into the desert. -Then what will happen to Simon? His family is gone. They'll think he's become a traitor. -But they should know he couldn't possibly have followed them in his condition. -Let's go see him. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] -Luckily, his wound isn't very serious. I'm sure he's getting better. -I'm afraid it will be an awful shock when he finds out what happened. Poor Simon. [GROANING] -Where am I? -You're here with me, Simon. -You must keep calm. You have to get some rest. -Judas, you mustn't do it. You mustn't. There's enough bloodshed, enough, enough. enough. -It's daybreak. The city seems sound asleep. -Now is the time to attack them. -Hm, all right. Come with me. Not a soul that I see. To the Temple. -There's not a living person here. -Now, listen to me. Keep your eyes open. This is one of their favorite tricks. They play dead and suddenly they stab you in the back. Move on. -Spread those coals. We'll burn this place to the ground. Come on. Let's get out of here. -Old man, where are you going? I'm just taking some water to my wife. What do you want with me? What do you want with me? -Where are the young men? Where are your sons? -I don't know anything. -Speak up. -I don't know anything. -You're lying. You're lying. -Please. -You Jews are all alike. We'll make your wife tell us where your sons have gone. -No, no, please. My wife's bedridden and blind. She's dying. [GROANS] -It seems the old man was right. There's only an old hag here. Burn the house down around her. [SCREAMS] -Well, what news? -The leaders of the revolt have fled with their families. And Judas has taken all the young man with him. -I wipe out every Jew in this city. For every man of ours, 10 of theirs. -Apollonius, I only want to remind you that dead men pay not tribute. -You right, we have a greater need of gold than of a pile of dead Jews. -I have already anticipated this wise decision of yours, my lord. And our soldiers, as you can see, have been drummed to obey you. -Ah, the elders of the city. Well, your heroic sons of have left. I'll make you pay for their rebellion. -We are old and feeble, and appeal to you for mercy and compassion. No hand of ours, my lord, was raised against you yesterday. -Trypho, do you hear how they touch my very heart strings. -Ah, the street is not a suitable place for a man of your rank to just these people. I have prepared a splendid hall of justice in your palace. -No, I wish to choose another residence which will have more character. That want. -That's the house of Mattathius. -And where are we to find such quantities of gold. What you are asking is impossible, my lord. -3,000 is all I'm asking. Now, leave this room. The sight of you ruins my appetite. -By all the gods, only 3,000 shekels of gold. They'll spoil their appetite indeed. -Mm, let them bring me what I've asked for. Then we can ask and get more. So on and on. But when this golden calf is squeezed and runs dry, then after that we will have it roasted. You seem to disapprove. Ah, of course, you do. I had forgotten that you and your friend are men of culture. Still, I've never seen you in battle. -My friends and I want to know what we're fighting for. But you won't we're cowards. -A soldier must understand nothing but obedience without question or explanation. -That's quite true for soldier, but I don't see how it applies to me. -Ah, you are not yet a soldier, quite true. I'd forgotten. But that's a deficiency of yours we can quite easily. I have just decided to make you and Rackus captains of a company of cavalry. -That's beyond your power. -It's not, Antinum, not when I act as the viceroy of our king, Antiochus. As for those Hebrew rebels who are your friends, your fellow soldiers are hot on their heels right now. -Halt. -Tracks of a caravan. They must be theirs. -Company, halt. -Keep moving, close together. -Judas, look over there. -Jonah. -Judas, it was a surprise attack. Ah, Jud-- -Once this was the flower of the people of the Lord. -Please, believe us. It is exactly what you asked. And to satisfy your wishes, our women folk have even given you the gold from their dowries. -Our soldiers you killed also had wives morning them today. Now leave this room. Out. -Keep them under close watch. -What's all this? Apollonius imposed a special tax on the city for his clemency after the revolt. 3,000 shekels of gold. -3,000 shekels, that's incredible. I wouldn't have thought there was so much gold in Jerusalem. I'm beginning to think my people are right. We will never reach a compromise. -Look I convinced Apollonius to listen to your proposal. Come on. He's waiting for you. -Apollonius is expecting us. -Let them pass. -I'm delighted to see you, Antinum. Apollonius put you in my division. He wants me to make a good officer out of you. My Lord. -Come in, Antinum. -This is the friend I told you about, sir. -He is your friend? Extraordinary. Strange to hear a Syrian soldier present a Hebrew as a friend of his. Don't go. I was actually only expressing a passing thought aloud. Antinum has told me about you and your ideas of brotherly love. -In which you do not seem to believe. -I'd like to hear your views. -I want to avoid the shedding of innocent blood and spare Jerusalem the loss of more citizens. -I see. Some wine? -A milder government on your part would deliver the city into your hands, at least resigned to its fate. -I've known Simon for years, Apollonius and I can vouch for his sincerity. -Very well, Simon. The people's behavior is dictated by the elders. Go and see them. Convince them. I can't promise you. But if they prove cooperative, we'll talk it over. -It won't be easy. The elders think I'm a traitor as it is. -Well, would they trust you if I confined the garrison to the citadel and took the gods away from the Temple. -If you do this, I promise you everything will change. Thank you. You too, my friend. -We have hear your proposal, but we cannot give you an immediate reply. We had no way of knowing how far we can place our faith in you. -The times unfortunately have put everyone on his guard. And I didn't expect to receive your confidence. I only ask you to compromise. -There is no way of compromising with those who have despoiled us of all that we once had. -If you've lost all that you had, what are you afraid of losing now? -Simon. -The Syrians have slaughtered all of my children. -What I want is for the future children of Israel to escape slaughter. How can you fail to see? Let's give it time to bear fruit. Now all I ask you is to try. We must convince the Syrians. I'm certain of this. Even if it's in vain, we must risk it. -Simon, I hate to discourage you but perhaps in your enthusiasm that makes you see things in a rosier light than the rest of us. I approve that our sons return to us and work at peaceful trades. But mark my words, if Apollonius fails to keep his promises, then Jerusalem will remain a city of children and old folk and our fields will not yield us their harvest. -May our almighty God show us his mercy and benevolence. Thank you. -Isiah. -I know what you're thinking, but Simon is different from his brothers, never fear. -The road from Joppa to Jerusalem must be repaired and made usable. And we will only be able to attack when we have enough supplies and reinforcements. -The Syrians are good soldiers but miserable workmen. And that is why this work is proceeding so slowly, my lord. -If there are young Jews to attack us. There must be plenty to work for us. We will set in motion our plan to snare them. And you'll see we won't lose a single man this time. Trypho, have the heralds proclaim that a spectacle will take place in the Temple square. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Look, Antinum, you should be glad. Hebrews and Syrians side by side in spite of what's happened. What's wrong? -The garrison at the governor's palace has been alerted for battle. -What does that mean? -One might think we were back in Athens with a spectacle like this. -It really is fabulous, Apollonius. -You have only seen the prelude, my dear. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What does this mean? -It means that I need young slaves to work on the road to Joppa. And what better way is there to acquire them? -Simon. -This is you your idea of being lenient, I suppose. -Quickly stop him. -Let them go. Set them free. Take me. Take me. I'm a Hebrew too. -Wait this man was a guest of the governor. He could not possible be a Jew. -Listen, I have betrayed you. I have not betrayed you. -Go back to the Syrians. -I have not betrayed you. Why don't you believe me? -Get away from us. -Traitor. -You're not one of us. -Keep away from us. -Officer, we're looking for a man, Simon Maccabeus, he was on the platform with the governor. -He went that way. -You take that street. The rest of you, follow me. Stop here. You men, block that street. You come with me. Where are you going? Who's inside this? -Why have we stopped? What do you want, officer? -We're looking for a man. He disappeared in this street. -And you think he's with me. You know who I am. -I must obey orders, my lady. -They're searching for a fugitive. If you've seen one, will you please tell him. -I saw a man running down that street. -Thank you, my lady. Hurry, men. This way. -All right, go on. [MOANING] -Take me too. Take me too. Take me. I'm Hebrew too. Take me. -Now we have plenty of Hebrew slaves to work for us. We can make short work of improving the road to Joppa. And when we discover the hiding place of the rebels, we will attack them in full force and then the road will have a new kind of milestone, the bodies of those rabble rousers. You can go. Trypho. -If you doubt his loyalty, we can assign him to patrol duty with Rackus. Don't worry about him. -Simon, wait. Take me with you. -That's impossible. And you know it. The Syrians are hunting me and to my own people, I'm a traitor. -Simon, I don't want you to leave me. -It's no use. I will join my brothers in the dessert. If I must die, let them condemn me. -Simon, in the street outside you will find a merchant. He has a horse for you. -I hope we meet again. -I think it better not to see each other. I mean, as long as we're destine to be enemies. -Antinum, you and I will never be enemies. -Don't be so sure. War does strange things. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Your father asked to carried up there to die on the site of all his people. -Father. -I've been waiting, my son. Oh, Lord, your lowly servant has reached the end of his path. As Moses before him, he led through the desert his chosen people. Receive him into thy bosom. [THUNDER CLAP] -It's raining. It's raining at last. -Water, praise be the name of the Lord. -We are save. -Water, we've received the blessing of the Lord. -You will leave immediately. You're must reach the oasis of Ben Yosef before daybreak. If you find no one there, you will proceed as ordered. Ride on until you contact the first vanguard of the enemy. You must guarantee me a free road for at least three days march. Understand? Your second in command has a tender heart. See that he gets over, Rackus. He must realize what sort of people his Hebrew friends really are. Show them no mercy. No on your horses. Trypho, I want speak to you. -Company, forward. -Trypho, I have pleasant news for you. I'm expecting a message of confirmation of your appointment as governor of the port of Joppa. -Oh, how can I thank you-- -Don't waste my time now, babbling expressions of your gratitude. If I'm sending you to Joppa, it's because I believe you are a person I can trust. You must guarantee that the port remains open when the times that I can no longer receive steady supplies from the interior. -Do you think it's possible that Joppa could be attacked by the rebels. -No, you can be sure the rebels will be destroyed soon, but even there, the Hebrews are a danger. -Leave the Hebrew to me. -I do. Now go. By dawn tomorrow, be on your way. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Where are the rebels? Speak up. -I don't know where they are. They haven't been here. -Seize him. -I swear I'm telling the truth, my lord. Please, let me go. I've got nothing. [SCREAMS] -Antinum, if you don't open your eyes, you will miss the best part of the show. Your tender heart will harden. Relax and enjoy it. Enemy blood is the most beautiful sight in the world. Look, Antinum. -We haven't seen Judah. We're not rebels. We're dying. Give us some water. -They're all lying. -Those men won't talk. -My heart is as tender as a little lamb's. Here-- here's your water, my friend. -What's the use of torture, Rackus. -Don't worry about them. They'll soon be out of their misery. -Water. Mercy. Have mercy. -Let's get out of here. The vultures will clean up after us. [SCREAMS] -Jonathan told me that you were here. -Simon, what is it? -It seems to be my destiny to destroy everyone I love. I caused the death of Antoine. And here you are forced to suffer with us. -Oh, I'm the happiest woman in the whole world. Because I'm here with you. [MUSIC PLAYING] -That's the vanguard of Apollonius' army. -Let's report to camp. -I'm getting worried, Judas. They should have been back an hour ago. -I told you to never leave your mother alone. -I've been with her life all night long. Nizra is with her now. -You must comfort her and never leave her by herself. What new have you brought? -The sight of the Syrian army, They're moving straight in our direction, Judas. -The mountains? -That's our only escape. -Simon, you and Jonathan will lead our people into the mountains. I'll try to hold off the siege and attack when it comes. -I'll go with. -You can count on my sword, Judas. -For Israel. -Glory to Judas. -God be with you. This would have been our father's were he alive. Now go. You too, Jonathan. Simon. Our people will have far more need of your brains than of my sword. -Judas. -I rely on. Farewell. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Judas, let's attack. -No, let them give the order for battle. -Launch the attack with the cavalry. Go on. [TRUMPETS SOUND] -Israel, follow me. -We are being held in reserve. When Judas sends for us, we will look death in the face without fear. -Simon, Simon, Judas has counter attacked. We will be massacred. They Syrians outnumber our men 50 to one. -For the glory of Israel. Follow me. Forward. [CHEERS] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Judas. -Judas, we're here. -I didn't send for the reserves. -But we have no other choice. -I give the orders. And the reserve is useless here. Retreat to the mountains. -Judas. -Our brother is dead. You, Simon, will have to save our people. -Why do you say this to me? -Simon, the path I've taken finishes here. -Judas -The Hebrews are retreating toward the mountains. Judas Maccabeus has been killed. -It's useless to give chase to them. We've seen and heard the last of these rebels for a long time to come. We're riding back to Jerusalem. NARRATOR: And indeed with the death of Judas Maccabeus the Hebrew revolt collapsed for a time. Then in their mountain refuge, the rebels met to choose a new leader. -But his youth is a guarantee of his purity of heart. -Simon, you've spoken like a man who is wise and free of self interest, qualities all must seek in our new leader. -If we continue to bandy words we'll never come to any conclusion. I vote for Jonathan. [CHEERS] Jonathan, your people are calling for you. Don't let them wait. -What are you saying? -I'm saying, I'm the first to embrace the new leader of Israel. Go outside. Go on. -Oh, Simon. -Don't worry. He will be a worthy successor to Judas. [SOBBING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Simon. -This wine we bought from the Arab merchant is good. Here, try it -No thanks. From now on, the leader of our people is named Jonathan. And so be it for as long as you wish it to be like this. I'm afraid-- I'm embarrassed to ask you, what should I do? -Don't doubt yourself Jonathan. You're the best of us. -How can you think that if I don't know what to do, Simon? -Only a man of honor is humble enough to seek the opinion of others. Listen to me as your older brother, Jonathan. Our people could never have found a better man to lead them. Now, here is my plan. Please understand, I'm not trying to influence your decision. We'll cut the supply line, which is like lifeblood to Apollonius and flows between Jerusalem and the port of Joppa. We'll make an alliance with the Arabs. -Hear me, my friends, I propose a toast to Apollonius, who with his brilliant gift for strategy permits the ladies and the noble lords of Joppa to drink without a care for tomorrow. -Trypho, Trypho, a vast Hebrew army is deployed along the sea coast and all the Arabs tribes of the desert have joined them. -Be quiet. Quiet you blithering fools. Keep calm. Keep calm. I shall immediately dispatch a request to King Antiochus for him to send an army to our relief. Have the heralds sound the alarm and all the Garrison ready for battle. There's nothing to fear. All we have to do is temporize and wait for troops. -Joppa is a heavily fortified city. But on this side, since they're counting on the natural protection of the sea, the walls are more accessible. In my opinion, we carry them and attack just before sunrise. -It would be much easier for us if these walls were only mere lines like these. But we have seen them with our own eyes. And I assure you it is impossible to scale them. -Nothing is impossible. -Well said. In fact, if we made a stairway of our fallen warriors we could walk right into the city. You're forgetting, young man, that the main reason we are here is you promised us an easy victory. -The reprisals taken by Apollonius and his Syrians have been severe, but they haven't hurt us as much as the losses we'd suffer if we attack Joppa without siege engines. -Exactly, I'm afraid we cannot agree to your plan, Jonathan. -What do you propose then? -A siege that will wear them down. We will at hand defeat them. We need only wait. -And wait until Apollinius relives them here. If we attack Joppa in force, we will certainly succeed in carrying it. But then, who knows how long we can hold. Perhaps you're right, Omar. Perhaps it's better to enter the city with full honors. No, I haven't lost my mind. I know Trypho. Offer him conditions to his advantage and he will open the gates of the city without striking a blow. -It's a flag of truce. -Come on, w better tell Jonathan. -Simon, even if our council with the Arabs achieves nothing else, you made it clear to me what I should do. -And? -I think you should know I've already sent an emissary to Trypho. -A wise decision of the new leader of Israel. Well done, Jonathan. I hope you sent your most convincing speaker. -My emissary is Diotima. I'm convinced I was not wrong to entrust her with this. But waiting to hear is nerve racking. Simon. -Jonathan, what is it? Speak up. -The emissaries from Joppa are here now. -Let's meet them. -Jonathan Maccabeus. -I am he. -Trypho has prepared to discuss terms. -Diotima has reported our conditions, I hope. -Trypho will grant you immunity and full honors. -Don't accept their offer. Syrians never keep a bargain. -Our proposal conceals no ulterior motive. If you wish, you can bring your soldiers with you. -Very well, I accept. -I will be by your side. And for the first time, I'll have an opportunity to wear my wedding dress. -I don't think this is the occasion for you to put it on. Take this to my mother. When the city has surrendered to us, I will make you the queen of Joppa. To your horses, quickly. -The Syrians are surrounding them. -They have not kept a bargain. -We've been betrayed. It's a trap. -They're closing the gates. It's a trap. We should never trusted them. -Men of Israel, we have been betrayed. I can only offer you certain death. -Then let us die for Israel. We will follow you until the end. -We must try and save Jonathan. To the attack. For Israel. -Stop! Come back. Oh, Lord, our efforts are hopeless. Joppa is impregnable. Now who once made a covenant with our people, give us a glorious death. Oh, God of Abraham, oh, Lord of Hosts, he is thy sword of vengeance. For Israel, follow me. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The governor's feeling to his palace. -Come with me. -Coward. Come back here. -No, no, no, spare my life. You have no right to kill me. I'm defenseless. No, no, no. -You bloated jackal. Eat, eat. Your favorite occupation in life. Where is my brother? Where is he? -Simon, the people of Joppa are with us. -The garrison is routed. -Simon, we found Jonathan. -I leave him with you. -Why you-- [SCREAMS] -Simon, he's over there. -Simon. -I swear you will be avenged. -Simon, I-- don't-- Simon-- Simon-- Simon. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ah, thank the gods, someone's arrive from Joppa. -I just arrived from Syria, my lord. -I get couriers from Syria but not a single load of supplies some Joppa. What news have you brought? -I have welcome news, my lord. King Antiochus has ordered large quantities of supplies for Jerusalem to be shipped by sea to Joppa. Perhaps they've already arrived. -Then Trypho is asleep. Get out. And the rebels seem to have vanished into the desert. Bring in that prisoner at once. Now then, what race are you? Syrian or Jewish? -I belong to the human race. -Take care. I know you've lived with the Jews. -I don't deny it. -A woman alone after having betrayed her people is found exhausted on the outskirts of Jerusalem, though certainly not in repentance for her hasty decision. -I'm waiting to hear yours, Apollonius. -You betrayed your country. You're a Syrian woman. You belong to the highest aristocracy of Antioch. Simon Maccabeus found refuge in your palace. Speak up. Where is he? -I don't know. Simon is always in my heart. I'm no different from all the other women who've lost their husband in war, whether their Syrians or Jews. -I should have guessed as much. You have been sent to plead for peace. We have utterly destroyed them. -You'll never destroy anything which has the right to live. -You have signed your own death warrant, woman. Take her away. Diotima will be sent to the gallows at dawn tomorrow for high treason. -Halt. [DRUMS BEATING] -People of Jerusalem, Apollonius, the royal governor and viceroy, has ordered the execution of this woman, Diotima, Syrian by birth. She's guilty of high treason against King Antiochus and will be hanged by the neck. -In respect to this merchandise of mine, it's all in order you know. See, my cousin's carrying sweet smelling orange. And my brother his brought porcelain vases of great value. And my husband has brought-- -I see you keep the business in the family, woman. -Syrian, you didn't let my wife finish I have brought the vengeance of Israel. For Israel, come with me. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Simon Maccabeus has entered Jerusalem. -We can't control the people anymore. -You'd better run for you life, my lord. -Pack of sheep. -Come back. Cowards. Filthy cowards, this woman will die all the same. I am the power. I am the power. [CROWD JEERING] -Wait. Stand back. Give him a sword. Now let him go. Get up. Diotima. -Stop where you are, Simon. Stop our I will kill Diotima. [CROWD CHEERS] -Diotima. -Simon, I didn't betray you. -Forgive me. -Long freedom and Jerusalem. Long live the people of Jerusalem. -Simon. [CHEERING CROWD] -Death to the Syrians. -Show them no mercy. -Crucify them. -Simon, mercy. Mercy and peace. -Come on. -Thou art appeased, oh, Lord. Throughout the land, thou has restored the children of Abraham. -Hang them. -Kill them all. -Show them no mercy. -They murdered our children. -Lord God has delivered our people. Which of you intends to strike the first blow? The tyranny which wielded this sword has fallen, so the law of this sword is broken. Let justice be done by God. [MUSIC PLAYING]
