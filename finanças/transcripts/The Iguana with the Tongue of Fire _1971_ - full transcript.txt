You! What are you doing? No... no! Oh, what awful weather! It may be romantic, mais très emmerdant, huh? Mais oui. Ireland is very beautiful but it's raining all the time. What a bore! But it's the rain that makes it so green and beautiful. Yes, yes, I suppose you're right. Where were you going? Well, I thought that you were late so I was going to do a little job. Hm. Thank you for visiting, dear. I didn't think you could get up so early in the morning. I could hardly believe it myself. If I didn't know that my husband was not in Dublin I would have thought that he was the author of such a miracle. Now you're getting evil. Perhaps, but I'm not playing the role of the jealous wife. - I know. - Come on. Here, put these parcels in the boot of the car. Er, perhaps it'd be better to put them next to me, on the seat. Yes, perhaps it's better. But if you have something else to do, I'll drive the car myself. Come on. No, no, madam. I beg your pardon, but my business is not important. It can wait. - Where can I drop you? - I have my own car, thanks. Oh... Bien alors. Mandel, stop first at Trinity College, then. Yes, madam. Bernard! Bernard, venez en voiture, chéri. But... Bernard, what are you doing? Come on, shoo! Oh, my God! What happened? Let's call the police. Yes, let's call the police. Oh... Hello? Hello, Jerry, it's you? Oh, Jerry! Something horrible has happened. Yes. Yes, here in the embassy. No, His Excellency is away as always. He's in Switzerland. - What are you doing? - Jerry? It's me. No, I came back last night. Listen, you'd better come over right away. As counsel of the embassy you will have to look after this affair. Yes. I don't think there's any need for Bernard to overhear this conversation. - Ah, but it was he who discovered her. - Well, exactly. We must make him forget what he has seen. - Darling. Darling, go. - Bernard. - Go upstairs. - Go to your room. I, uh... I came back earlier than I expected. It never stopped raining in Davos. Did you call on Marc? No. No, I didn't stop over in Zürich. Were you alone? As always, my darling. Now, when Jerry comes, will you please tell him to get in touch with the police immediately? - Who are you? - My name is Johnson. I'm the doctor. Oh, I've called for him. Well, have you written your report? Yes, it's right here. And... do you think it is possible to recognize this person? I would say it's impossible. The murderer has done a perfect job. A specialist, I would say. Like me. Inspector Lawrence. Excuse me, sir. - This letter is for you, sir. - Thank you. This must be the woman who was in the boot of the Rolls-Royce. Really? What, and nothing else? Not even a letter? What did you expect? The murderer's name and address? And an invitation to drop by for tea between five and six? - No, but... you never know. - Get a move on. According to this passport, she was born in Holland. - So? - Well, it may be a coincidence, but Mr Sobiesky, before he came to Dublin, was ambassador to The Hague. We'd better call him in for questioning. For God's sake, man, wake up! Do you think we're enough to call an ambassador in for questioning? It will be a lot if we get permission to question the members of his staff. I'd like to see him try and stop us. He can do it quite easily. I'll have to get onto the Foreign Ministry if I'm to get to the bottom of this enquiry. - Will they give us permission? - Let's hope so but it won't be much use. At the most, all we can do it is to get him declared persona non grata. While we wait for the bloody bureaucrats to make up their minds our boy will have time to slit three or four other throats. Is there nothing else we can do? Don't worry, Johnson. I'll go on making my enquiries all the same. And I couldn't care less if I am accused of being unorthodox. - Get me? - But how? You'll find out. Give her a good rub down. Your Excellency, Inspector Lawrence is here to see you. Why didn't you tell me this before? He arrived without warning. He's in the library. Inspector Lawrence of the Homicide Squad, Your Excellency. He insisted on speaking to you. - Hello, Inspector. Please. - How do you do, Your Excellency? Oh, uh... Matches. I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr Ambassador, but I find myself in a particularly... embarrassing position. I quite understand. And I'm going to collaborate with the police. Naturally, I expect this investigation to be carried out - with the utmost discretion. - Yes, Mr Ambassador. There's a question I should like to ask you. Did you know that woman? - Which woman? - I meant the one... the one that was in... Oh, the one who was in the luggage boot of my car? Well, I might tell you, Inspector, after one glance and... quite frankly I didn't feel like taking a second one, the lady seemed to me utterly unrecognizable. Because of that, do you think the man who killed her... Or woman. What makes you think the murderer might be a woman? Well, why not? It's just a thought. After all, as far as I can see, there's no evidence one way or the other. You spoke of the man who committed the murder. I seem to suggest that it might have been a woman. Why? Isn't it possible? Certainly, it is possible. The use of vitriol does suggest a woman's hand. Or a colored person's. They're expert at such things. I'm grateful for your suggestion. Don't rely too much on the words of a diplomat, Inspector. Remember we are all professional liars. We may do it with a certain amount of style and elegance but... we are still liars. So you have no idea who might have put that corpse in your car? Or why? No. No, I haven't the faintest idea. However, if it's any use to you, I might suggest that this could be an attempt to create a big scandal, which would compromise relations between our two countries which right now happen to be excellent. Yes, I suppose so. You're most kind, Your Excellency. - I don't know how to... - Oh, not at all. It's my duty to collaborate with the authorities of the country of which I'm a guest. It's a matter of courtesy, hmm? Would you allow me to question some members of the embassy staff? Yes, of course. But not here. Call them to the police station, will you? Whom do you want to see? For the moment, it will be enough to talk to the chauffeur. And the governess. Later, perhaps... Well, let's hope the matter will end there. It will be so much better for all of us. I'll take you to your car. - No, don't worry. - No, it's a pleasure. - Maggie? - You are here too. Yes. Who is it they're questioning in there now? Mandel, the chauffeur. Listen, Maggie, there is one thing I would like to ask. You can be sure, Miss, I know what I have to say and what I haven't. I'm not so stupid as to tell the police everything about the ambassador's private life. That would be quite useless to the police and dangerous for me. - So... - What do you want me to say? You've been making questions now for two hours and I don't know what I can tell you that I haven't already told you. You haven't told me much. I'm sorry. I suffer from conjunctivitis. I can't bear the light. Rather inconvenient for your kind of job. - Yes, it is. - You haven't replied. I've told you everything. That night I went out as usual. To go to the pictures, wasn't it? Yes, to the pictures, even if I can't prove it. You can take your glasses off now. There's not too much light in here. It was almost midnight. I got home. I put the car in the garage and locked the doors. Yes, you told us that. I'm telling you for the hundredth time. Take it easy. We're just asking questions. But you ask questions like you suspect that I'm guilty. That's your opinion. He only wants to know if you've forgotten some detail that might be important to us. I do not forget anything. All this means, therefore, is that when you got back to the embassy, somebody else could have put the corpse in the boot of the car. That's what I say, and the next morning I brought the car around and was waiting for Mrs Sobiesky to come down. That's not what the governess said. Why? What the hell did she...? That stupid... - And so? - A lot. She said that when she came out of the embassy with Mrs Sobiesky it looked as if you were in a hurry to go somewhere and that you only reversed the car because you saw them coming out. Well, I didn't think that was worth mentioning. Why did you take the car out? Well, that morning I thought they would come out late so I thought I would dash up to the cleaners. Are these the cleaners? - Yes, that's the place. - What was so urgent? Did you have a shirt that was dirtier than usual? I don't know what you mean. I'm only telling you the facts. We appreciate that, even if sometimes your facts are incomplete. It's a question of distraction. Then what? That's all, nothing else. Very well. If in the future you should happen to remember something else, some detail that you think is unimportant, instead of keeping it to yourself, you might let us know. You can go now. You can tell the ambassador that so far as you are concerned the investigation is over. I won't see him again. The ambassador has left. - And besides... - Besides? Nothing. Take it, but remember this is the last time. Now, get out and stay out. Hmm. Is that all he gave you? He gets tighter every day, the old bastard. I gave him what he asked for, but it's the last time. I'm fed up. All right, I agreed to keep your son, but there's a limit to everything. But... you could have let me speak to him. Maybe... No! No, this is the only way. The sooner he goes back to Switzerland, the better it is for all of us. You frightened me, sweetheart. You scare easily, don't you? How did you manage to get in? It doesn't require much imagination to find a back entrance. Guess who's here tonight. I don't care. How much? Once when you offered to give me money, as I recall, you offered it with a certain flair. And you too, when you asked for it. I'm going to need more. How much, then? A lot. And if I refuse? I wouldn't do that, if I were you. Can you give me change for the phone? Sure. Where did he go? I don't know, and I don't care. - Mr Jones. Mr Jones! - What's the problem? Is that new singer. She's dead in her dressing room. Excuse me, I'm a doctor. Maybe I can help. No, I think it's too late. Anyway, you'd better come with me. All right, go back. There's nothing to see. No. Wilhelm, go to the door, don't let anybody out and call the police. Move back, please, everyone. Come on now, move back. Go back to the bar. Go on, now. All right, everybody, keep calm now. It's only a fuse. Please stay where you are. Stay calm. No one is to leave the premises, please. We must wait until the Guards get here. You're showing a fine turn of speed there, Miss. Getting a bit stuffy, wasn't it? Are you running for your car? No. I was with a friend. We came in a taxi. Ah. Well, never mind. I'll give you a lift. - Here, you'll need this. - But I thought you had a car. Oh, the only car you're going to see around here is the paddy wagon. - You mean the police? - That's right, only we call them the Guards. Now, get your finger out and hop on. - Who is your friend? - A friend. Would it be enough to say thank you in return for your kindness? Oh, there's no need for thanks. All this trouble for nothing? I didn't exactly say that. Are you making for the airport? No, I live outside Dublin. You know the Manors? - Uh-huh. - You do? Then to the Manors. Do you always take advantage of disasters to pick girls up? Well, I wouldn't consider it a habit now. - Do you have a name? - Of course. - Well, what is it? - Helen. Do you want to hear my life story too? Turn in there. Well, now, my fleet-footed filly, are we going to have it off in the bushes or on the bike? Hmm. It's damp in the bushes. You could have asked me in a roundabout way for a scotch or a cup of tea. You know, I'm a great believer in formality. Like you. Mm, you have a nice turn of phrase too. Here, now, as long as you're going to keep me standing outside. - Isn't this the place they found the...? - That they found a corpse? Yes. Curious, isn't it? You picked me up in a club where they found another corpse. Funny it doesn't seem to worry you very much. Why should it? I'm not the murderer. Do you work here? As the ambassador's daughter. Shall we go in? You coming? - Oh! Hello, Mandel. - Good evening, Miss. You look so strange. Aren't your eyes better? Much better, thank you. - Good evening, sir. - Hi. Good night. Let's go upstairs and have that whisky we talked about. Well, now that's a good start. Thank you. Helen? Would you come here for a moment? That's my father. I hope he's in a good mood. By the way, if he asks me who you are...? Well, now, I've washed dishes, swept the streets and done a little gun-running. If he waits a couple of years, he can read the book I'm writing about my life. Oh, that's my father. He won't smoke any other brand. But I've never known him to finish one yet. Would you like one? Oh, no, I can't stand the things myself. Shall we go and hear some nice records? - Aha! Would you call that diplomacy? - Oh, don't be silly. The bushes were never like this. If you want anything, help yourself. Who are you calling? Oh, there you are. That's the way I like you. Let's go. Mother, the telephone. Mother! For pity's sake, it's the phone! - Oh, Mother! - Now, eat your dinner. - Come on now, be a good pussy cat. - Hello? Yes, it's himself. Eat it up. - Yes. - Yes, you're a good pussy cat. - Hello, Daddy. Hi, Granny! - Sweetheart. Find Granny's glasses and put them on her, for the love of God. Go on, pussy, eat it. Eat it. Come on. Now, where the devil have they got to? - All right, then. - What is it, Sacha? Come on. Not hungry? - OK. - Come on, now. Oh, dear. Give Granny a kiss, dear. Oh... Thanks, dear. Granny, why didn't you keep your glasses on? Daddy got angry because you didn't as usual. But I can't see anything. And if I can't see how can I find my glasses? Anyway, if you didn't go out all the time, you could answer the phone. Hmm! There, I've collected all the clippings on those two murders and I think I know who the killer is. - Did you say something? - What do you want me to say? If you don't put on your glasses, you'll never hear it. Keep 'em on a string. - And didn't I tell you...? - I just gave them to her! Now, then... All right, Mother. Hm... Who is it, then? You're pulling my leg. Why, it never crossed my mind, Mother! Oh, yes, you are. I know it. You think because I'm old and never go out that I can't find out who committed a crime just by studying the facts of the case. But you remember that old woman in the Agatha Christie books? You know I don't like detective stories. That's another of your defects. You read too little. Dare say. Now, who do you think is the killer? Hold on to your seat, Daddy, while Granny tells you. As for you, young lady, just you remember your place! Now, then, Mother, don't go changing the subject. Come on, now. Out with it, Miss Marple. - Who is it? - Are you listening? - Well? - Mmm-hmm. It's the son of the ambassador. - The son of the ambassador? - Mmm-hmm. No, no, no, no! You'll be saying next it's Father O'Connor. Well! - Daddy! - What is it? Daddy, where are you going? Secret mission. All right, now, get 'em up. And don't you move. Now, let's take a look at your ugly mug. God help...! Like a whisky, John? How, with these things on? Take those handcuffs off him. I told you I was going to use unorthodox methods in this case. He's my unorthodox method. You might have told me that you... that I'd find your unorthodox friend... in that flat. - It would have saved my chin. - If you went there, you went there on your own initiative. Too much zeal sometimes gets a man into trouble. Go on. Good luck. - You were too hard on those two. - Hmm. They weren't exactly kidding either. You haven't changed since... You mean, since when I was in your place, Lawrence? 'All right, then. 'I said, "Talk!" 'Talk! 'Talk! Talk! 'Talk! Damn you!' 'I know you did it! Talk! 'No, you don't. 'No!' Why do you act this way? I don't even know myself. Could be the memory of my wife's murder, the thought that every criminal I meet might be the killer. When I saw your sergeant walk in, my mind went suddenly haywire because I thought he might be the one that I've been looking for. Thanks. You know, I remember once in Brazil I stepped on an iguana hidden among the jungle foliage. This murderer too is certainly living amongst us, perhaps under our very eyes. You know, the iguana is clever at disguising itself. The only difference is that the iguana, though horrible, is harmless, while our murderer is probably pleasant to look at but he cuts throats and uses vitriol. It's his tongue of fire, you might say. Now, then, about that girl. Come off it. Don't play the fool. You know what I mean. The ambassador's daughter. Cultivate her. It could be useful. It's the only discreet way we have of finding out what the ambassador is up to. All right, if you want. Hell, what is she? Just another bird. Try not to get into too much trouble. You know the risk I took giving you this job. - I won't forget it. - Where are you going now? To the hospital, to get myself sewn up. Doctor, there's a man here who needs your help. - Well, then, sit him down. - Come along. Sit yourself down here. I won't need your help for this job. You may go. Switch off the light, please. It's rather a deep wound. A fight? You might say, yeah. I'll have to... inform the police. Oh, don't worry. They were there at the time. Don't move. Do you think that they will find the embassy murderer? I wouldn't have any idea and I couldn't care less. The police will never find him. Never. He's too clever. Much too clever. Ow! Good evening, sir. Oh, Norton... A bow of homage to the man who took my girl from under my eyes. And how is it you know my name? Who doesn't know the name of Inspector Norton? Or should I say of ex-Inspector Norton, known as "the brute"? Doesn't it ever occur to you that sooner or later one of your victims might try to do you? Do you call that a threat? No, only a little bit of advice. Then here is a bit of advice for you, my boy. Don't run into me again. Madam, I... - Oh, hello. - I'm sorry to be disturbing you. No, you don't disturb me at all. Helen won't be long. Please sit down. - Thank you. - No, here. Here, beside me. I was hoping, you see, that I would be lucky enough to have a little chat with your husband. I mean, of course, His Excellency. I am sorry, you are not lucky at all. His Excellency has gone back to Switzerland. I am alone. As always. The way you're saying it, I... How do you expect me to say it? It's the truth. Behind... this facade you are looking at there is the most terrible, unbelievable emptiness. Between me and my children, between me and... ...my husband. It's what I suppose they call nowadays uncommunicability. Yes, uncommunicability! Je suis formidable, formidable. ♪ L'amour est un oiseau rebelle ♪ Que nul ne peut apprivoiser ♪ But you see, the terrible thing is that I can't fire up. At least not as I did before. I'm no longer young. But I'm not for the rubbish heap yet. You shouldn't be talking like that. You're a very beautiful woman. You are sweet but I know you don't mean it. No, no, no, don't try to deny it. I know you don't mean it. Anyhow, it's very nice to hear it said by... such an attractive and charming man. That's a marvelous fine lighter you have. From Cartier. I would willingly give it to you, but I can't. It was a present from my first husband. Yes. When I married His Excellency I had already two children, Helen and Marc. Bernard, the little boy, was born from my second marriage. Now I only have memories. And pleasure I can get from these. One of the few advantages I can get from being the wife of an ambassador. No police, no search warrant, nothing. Poor Mr Norton. I hope you haven't bothered him too much, Mummy. Not a bit of it. Your mother has been delightful company. Another lie. You know, Helen, this gentleman, he's quite... quite charming. He's a charmeur. - Where did you find him? - Between one corpse and another. Oh, mon dieu! Quelle façon de causer. What a horrible thing to say! Well, I think I... Well, it was very nice to chat with you. - Yes, thank you. Goodbye. - Hope to see you soon. À bientôt. This friend of yours is rather becoming a pain in the arse. I don't know why you're talking like that. He's such a charming man. And not at all... boring. I'm beginning to get a little worried about you. You know, what little mind you had has been eaten up by those drugs. You are going too far, Excellency de merde. I'm merely trying to lower myself to your level. I am there at the place where I picked you up, remember? Mon chou, how can I forget it? It's one of the most lovely souvenirs of my life. But I don't know what you are bragging about. You only got to this rank just because you've been bowing and scraping to one minister after another. How dare you speak to me like that? You can order your servants around or your whores. And from now on you can go out with them to your boring reception and your official appearances. - Do you want me to break your neck? - Don't try to raise one finger to me. Ah, you have no idea how far I can go. You bitch. You fucking bitch! You bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Your place? Fabulous. What time? Yes, five. See you then. Well, then, I fixed the party for tonight. Sort of an all-male affair. Oh, yeah? Well, you can count me out. I have a date with Helen and I don't want to lose her. Count me out too. I have something else on myself for tonight. You can't! I've arranged everything. Ah, come on, Jerry. Don't get your knickers in a twist. - You can't just...? - Oh, no? Why should we do what you want? You take it easy. Don't try pushing me too far. I warn you, it wouldn't take much before I... Oh, what a roar! Well, lion, what would you do? Tell me, or shall I knock your face in? John, why don't you come with me to Switzerland? It's out of the question. Will you tell me something, Helen? Did you know your father was having an affair with that girl found in the car? No, of course not. He was going with the one in the club too. What I'm saying doesn't seem to astonish you a bit. - Now, why is that? - Why should it astonish me? My father has always been a collector. He happens to collect women. Now, why all these questions, Inspector Norton? - You know who I am? - I have known from the start, ever since that evening you drove me home. My father recognized you. Then Walter confirmed it. I see. So that's why he called you into the library and you had that argument. I don't remember having an argument with my father that evening. Then I'd say you had an unusual way of conversing. Well, it's true, Father, that is stepfather, can be a little original in his behavior at times. But he's just like that. It's not important. But tell me, why did you leave the police? I'd rather not go into it. What is the matter? - Can't say I care for that customer. - Oh? What do the papers say? Oh, there's a lot of speculation on Sobiesky's role in this affair. The usual things to arouse readers' interest. They're only agreed on one thing. That we are incompetent and inefficient. - Hello, Joe. - Norton. Will you give me a pint of the black stuff? We've got something that's been waiting for you. You have? Letter. My precious pussy. You go down to the kitchen and have some food. That's right, my pussy. Go on, down you go. That's my puss. Who's there? It's me, Mother. Is this your razor? Yes, it's mine. I thought I might shave the old way again for a while but I found out I was a bit wobbly. You see? I see there's been a new murder. And I suppose you already know who did it. And I suppose your suspicions are on the ambassador's wife because you found her lighter at the scene of the crime. But you're not listening! Oh, for crying out loud! Of course I'm listening, go on. No, no, no! A criminal on this level would never be so stupid as to leave such obvious clues behind. Somebody has done that to fool the police. That shows the murderer is an intelligent person, even if a bit infantile. If you've never read anything but the story of Tom Thumb, you must know that. So? Go on. The murderer is the little boy. The little monster. Believe me. Hi, Granny. Hello, Daddy. I'm going to the kitchen. I'm hungry. Erin, what is it? - Er, Miss Sobiesky, please. - If you go through there, you'll find the young lady in the bar, first door on the right. Have you got a pen and paper? Thank you. Would you perhaps be kind enough to see that this reaches her? Of course. Her boyfriends even follow her out here! What a surprise. I could of... missed you, you know? A bad sign, hmm? By the way, who are those two fellas you were with? You're jealous, huh? Could be. One is my brother Marc and the other one is a friend of his. I was hoping to have a word with your father. Is it very urgent? More or less. You'll find him over at the bobsleds. He spends all his time there. Uh, there's my father's bobsled. Oh! Do you mind if I sit down? Please. I'm fully aware of the reason for your visit. And I can assure that I intend to take full advantage of my diplomatic immunity to refuse any further comment on an unfortunate incident or in any of the others which followed it. Now, if that is quite clear, Norton, then maybe I can offer you a drink. Or a cigar. Thanks. Would you believe I flew all the way to Switzerland for the purpose of finding out what brand of cigar you smoke? And now you know. - There was something else. - I thought we had finished. It seems I was expecting too much from a policeman. Are you aware that your bobsled was sabotaged? Somebody was trying to kill you. Oh well, that's really very good news. I thought it was my fault. Well, in any case, you send your report to the federal police. Um, why don't you stay on another day or two? No, I have to get back. Why didn't you tell me you'd rented that place in Dalkey? I rented nothing in Dalkey. Are you out of your mind? Listen, the time is long past when I used to enjoy solving riddles. So if you're hiding something from me, it's better for you that you tell me now. But I swear to you, I don't even know where Dalkey is. It took a while but I tracked down the solicitor for the woman who owns the house. I saw the lease. It had your name on it, Helen, in nice clear letters. Some of your dresses were hanging in the bedroom closet. And one other thing. There was a guest in the house when I got there. A very dead one. And he wasn't in the closet, though. He was in your bed. Look, if this is a joke, it's in very bad taste. No, it's no joke. The dead house guest was your old pal, Walter. You haven't forgotten him too, have you? How horrible. It's terrible. I can't believe it. It can't be true. It's true, Helen. They're all facts, like the fact I also found a lighter in the room. A very special one, a Cartier lighter. Then there's the fact that... that Walter's body was covered with flowers. I've no idea why, possibly to hide the ugly gash across... ...across the poor devil's throat. Now will you tell me the truth? I've told you the truth already. I don't know what you're talking about. It's all so shocking, so awful, and... ...and after all you've just told me, you found my mother's lighter. If that's true, why didn't you immediately go to her, instead of torturing me with these silly accusations? That's just what I'm going to do the minute I arrive back in Dublin. I want that killer, and embassy or no embassy, I'll get him. - Good day. - Something terrible has happened. Thank goodness you're here, sir. Madam was trying to kill herself in the... in the bathroom. She is still alive. Will you call an ambulance? Mandel. Inspector. I was waiting for you. I want to speak with you. Have a beer? The ambassador didn't need you any longer? So you know too? Almost three weeks ago he said with my conjunctivitis I couldn't drive anymore. Mmm-hmm? Only, he has to pay me what he owes me. He thinks he can take advantage of me because he's a diplomat on foreign soil. But he doesn't know the likes of me. I will knock his block off even if they put me inside for it! And... That fucking bastard! And why didn't they give you a month's notice? I... I don't know. It was twenty days ago. That's why I'm sitting here, free as the air and without a penny in my pocket, you know? Twenty days ago... That'd be right after the murder, then? Yes... Yes, you are right, now that I think of it. - You smoke? - Uh-uh. No, I don't. Oh... they got broken when I got off the bus. Some bastard gave me a shove, you know? Uh, I heard the crack but I didn't take any notice at the time and, uh, when... - When are you pulling out? - Why? Nothing. I might just want to have another word with you, you never know. I'm sorry you're broke, you know? I'll take these with me and have them fixed. Why did you do it? I... I didn't try to commit suicide. Someone tried to kill me. Who? Who was it? I'm sorry, sir, but you'd better go now. Well, then, Hobbs, what's your opinion? There's no doubt about it, Inspector. This piece came from those glasses. Very well, you can go now. Mmm... You don't seem sure. What doesn't fit in according to you? I don't know. It just doesn't fit. We'll discuss your misgivings later. This is Jack Mandel's address. Bring him here. Well, what are you waiting for? Go on. All right, what is it that doesn't fit in according to you? Does it surprise you that a murderer should leave such obvious clues? Lawrence, if you had a mother like my mother you'd know what it means to have misgivings. We just have to wait for a few minutes and then we'll know the answer. Hello? Inspector Norton, please. Yes, put him through. It's for you. - 'Hello? Inspector Norton?' - Yes, go ahead. - 'Listen, I went to get my money.' - It's Mandel. I heard Mrs Sobiesky shouting and if I hadn't come in at that moment, she would have ended up like the other victims. No! I saw the person who was trying to kill her. Yeah. 'I cannot tell you who it was because... 'because I'm scared, you understand? 'But it was not me, right?' Yes, I know that, for God's sake. Who was it? I... I'm sure you've already got an idea about who it is since from the beginning... Argh! No! Mandel! Mandel! Just a moment. I'm not deaf! I'm coming. The lady wants to talk to Mr Norton. I said he wasn't in, but... I'm Helen Sobiesky, I'm a friend of your son. I know everything about you. - Everything? - Yes. - May I come in and wait for him? - Of course. Now, thank you, Guard. Thank you. I seem such a prisoner with these policemen but my son wanted it. He said we're safer but it's such a bore. - Will he be very late? - Oh, I don't think so. But please sit down. I'll get you some coffee. - Do you like coffee? - Yes, but don't bother. It's no bother. Here you are, Miss Sobiesky. You must think I'm terribly rude but John has talked so much about you and Erin... That's his daughter's name, I believe? ...that I felt a desire to see his home. You're a woman. I'm sure you understand my curiosity. Of course I understand, but don't worry. - Come and have some coffee. - Thank you. No, two, five. Yes, thank you. Mmm-hmm. Hello? Who do you want to speak to? Hello? This is Inspector Norton calling from Dublin. I want to speak to Mr Marc Sobiesky. I'll go and see if he's in. - Who is it? - Shh. I'm sorry, Mr Sobiesky is out. If you leave your number, I'll have him call you when he gets back. No, don't bother. You're very kind, but I'm afraid I can't wait any longer. Please excuse me, and would you tell your son that I'll call him later? Of course I will. And I do hope you'll come again very soon. Thank you, I will. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You frightened the life out of me. When will you learn that if you don't wear your glasses you can't hear anything? Somebody could come in and kill you like they did the cat. With that policeman out there that's not possible. - Well, you could bolt the door. - What? You could bolt the door! Taxi. Taxi, over here! Taxi! Oh! Help! Help me, somebody! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Do you think we... we should inform the police? There's time for that later. Right now we don't know what it was. An accident? Attempted murder? Maybe she wanted to kill herself. The only thing we do know is that you fished her out of the river in a state of shock. Do you think she's one of them junkies? Maybe. But it's strange. She has some bruises on her forearm. I don't know exactly what caused them. For the moment, the only thing to do is to let her sleep. It's all clear now. Oh... Oh, dear. Are you using his sun lamp again? Well, I hope it isn't your father. Oh, too stiff these bolts. Ah, Helen, my dear! Do come in. My son isn't here, but this time I won't let you go till he comes back. And this time you must have a cup of my excellent coffee. Please, sit down. I'll just put the kettle on. Oh, dear, I should have put on a saucepan instead of a kettle, but it's too late to worry. Help! Granny! Help! Granny! No! Let me go! Granny, help! Help! Granny! Help me, Granny! Granny! Help me! What are you...? - Hello, William. - Huh? I'll be in for the rest of the night. You can go. That's very good of you, sir. Thanks. Anything new in the papers? There's nothing the politicians won't solve, sir. Good night. Daddy! Help! Erin! - Erin... - She's got Granny! Helen. Helen! You're crazy! You're... You're her brother! For God's sake! I'll kill you like all the others! I'll kill you! Mother! Daddy! Look out! Marc had always been perverted, sick. He hated us. Oh, I think he hated everyone whom he thought was happy, beautiful, lucky. Yes, he really tried to destroy us. He tried to make us look responsible. All those murders. Mandel, the chauffeur, found out the truth and was trying to blackmail him. Well, the rest you know. Anyway, my career is quite over. At least, I shall have time to try and forget. And what's happened with Helen? She's in Paris. She'll join us later. Anyway, I hope so. It's all a bit pathetic, isn't it? You'd have put the handcuffs on him quick enough. Yes, because... ...it was he who killed the girl they found in the car. That was what touched off Marc's wild spree. Why didn't you tell me this before? It would have been useless. You wouldn't have been able to do anything. Anyway, when he arrives back in his own country he'll be in for an unpleasant surprise. He won't have his diplomatic immunity then. And this time, he won't screw the police. I'm for a drink.
