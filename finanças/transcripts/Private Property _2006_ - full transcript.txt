PRIVATE PROPERTY To our boundaries Fran?ois! Fran?ois! What do you think? Not bad. - You like the colour? Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah. - I'm too fat. - Turn around. You're not too fat. It was cheap, they were on sale. Three for 50. Yeah. You're right. That's pretty cheap to look like a whore. - Seriously? Do I look like... - Nah. No, Mum, it's fine, I'm sorry. Very nice. I'm sure it'll look great on Fran?ois. Check this out, he's got a G-string on. Don't you like strings? Thanks. How's the baby? Yeah, fine. - What about the bike? - You have to check with your mother. Look, I told you not to come here any more. Don't come round any more, full stop. Just transfer the money. - Meet wherever you want, but not here. - Pascale, I'm not a bank. - And I can still see them, can't I? - Yes, but not here. Are we going to have a fight because I came to see the kids? No, but do I go and do my stuff at your place? I bought this house. Without my money, who knows where you'd be? If you want to see your father, you'll have to do it somewhere else. I still have a right to see them, God damn it! All right, Luc, that's enough. What the hell do you care if we see him here? I'm sick of seeing your father's face, can't you understand that? If you want to talk to me, call me, but let's not quarrel in front of the boys. - Yeah, well, see them at your house. - You know how things are with Carine. - Get off my back. - Get out of here. - All right... - Get out of here. - The bike. - Keep your cash. It's for the bike. Listen, that's it. I'm not putting their money in your account any more, you got that? - Fine. - You're happy? - Yeah, I'm happy. - Fine. And if you keep it up, I won't send any more money at all. You mother wants you all to herself, well, let her fend for herself then. I've been taken for enough as it is. Yeah, right, sure, fuck off. Fuck off with your goddamn money. Get yourself a therapist. It's the same thing every time. He has a fight with her and then comes here. - How do you know? - I know him better than you do. He gets fed up there, he runs over here and thinks I'm going to greet him with open arms. - He just came to see us, that's all. - He wants to fuck things up. He just wants to wreck everything. I don't know how Carine manages. When I think of all the things he wanted me to do for him. - How could I do it? - Is there any more? No, I forgot to buy some. If it hadn't been for you, I would have left a long time ago. I promise you that. - Can I have the car tonight? - I told you I needed it. OK, take it easy. I'll drop you off. For ten years he's known he shouldn't be coming here. He's sick. - Sick. - OK, Mum, calm down. You don't know what it's like. If you ever become like him, I'll kill myself. I will. Wow, the speed... You're cheating. Yeah, but you'd... Whatever, you can't play. You're gonna lose anyway. - What are you doing? - I went back to sleep. - I missed my bus. - I'll drive you. - You're going to be late. - Doesn't matter. Fran?ois, my T-shirt. Fran?ois, where is my T-shirt? I don't know. Get out! - What is this? - You never wear it anyway. It's my T-shirt. Come on, hurry up. Tell me, Pascale, what's preventing you? I'm sure that if you don't do it now, you never will. You have to do it. Got to jump. Some day, Thierry and Fran?ois will be gone. You'll see. They'll fall in love. It goes fast. You're not just going to stay alone with all your stuff? Come on, concentrate. Are you thinking about her? You're thinking about her. Shut up. - Is she any good? - Shut up and play. - Come on, Thierry, tell me if she's good. - Yeah, she's good, of course she's good... - I bet she's dumpy. - Fuck off. Hey, I only saw her face. Tell me. Mind your own business. Do I ask if you wank with both hands? - Come on. - We can't play this way. Come on, let's go, let's play a game. So what, isn't it nice? What, your hair? What's that, Mum? You shouldn't have done it. It looks awful. Well, it's not awful. A hairdresser did that to you? - Was he disturbed or what? - Yeah, he was out of it. Kind of a Flemish-from-hell look. It's a bit of a Flemish do, yeah. Mum, what have you done? Thank God, it grows back. OK, stop it, Fran?ois. That's enough, really. Come on, we're just teasing. I think I'm going to quit my job. I want to do something else. - What would you do? - I don't know. I feel like setting up my own business. I could start a restaurant somewhere cool, rent some rooms. With that haircut? A B and B, I don't know, something cosy. - I'd like that. - Right. Why not? But, Mum, you can't start a B and B just like that. You can't even cook. Thank you very much. Anyway, I can always take on someone who can. - Who? That makes no sense. - It's a nice idea. How would she go about it? She has no qualifications, no money, no experience. - She doesn't need all that. - No, you're right. Everybody knows you can start a B and B any which way you want. - No, but when there's a will, there's a way. - There's a will, there's a way. Listen to yourself. You don't start a thing like that at her age! She's got to keep her job, like everyone else. She's lucky to have one anyway. Yeah, but if she feels like changing... Like in that film the other night, the girl went off to the country, changed her life and all that... It's not the same thing. That was a film, Fran?ois. - That girl was 30. - Hand me your plate. She was a pharmacist, she had money. Not at all the same thing. You're the one who should get off your arse instead of sitting around all day. - Wait a second, I haven't stopped. - What the hell are you doing? You're sanding a door. Is that how you're going to get rich? It's not going to get you far, Fran?ois. In any event, she's broke. How would you go about getting money? The banks aren't going to lend you anything. - Where would you find the cash? - I don't know. There you go. I could sell the house. I'm not going to stay here forever. One of these days you'll be gone. I don't want to stay here by myself. You want to sell the house? Fran?ois, it's going to have to happen one day. - Yeah, but you don't need to sell the house. - Why not? Are you stupid or what? - I'm not, and I didn't say it was a done deal. - Well, I certainly hope not. You want to sell the house so you can do your stupid B and B thing? - I didn't say that. - Yes, you did. You just did. - It's the family house. - No, it's my house. - Well, it's not your family's house. - It's been my house for ten years now. If I want to sell it, I will. Shit, you OK? Hold it. Hold it. Aren't you going to tell them? It's inside out. Come on. - Was someone here? - Jan. - Who's Jan? - The neighbour. He came by to say thanks for the lawnmower. - He borrowed our lawnmower? - Yes. And he brought you a pie? Well yes, I had lent him the lawnmower. You ate the pie together or what? Has he got a soft spot for you? - What? - Are you blind? What's your problem? Hello, thank you for the mower, Missus. Oh, here's a little cherry pie. Hello, you. Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming. You don't even know him. - You want to do him? - Shut up. I've had enough, you're filthy. Mum, we're just kidding. Sorry! And thanks again for the pie, hey! - We're going to sell the bike. - Why? Sell mine, the parts, and then buy another one, a smaller one. The parts... hang on... there are no parts left. Roger would take mine for 300 euros, 150 for the parts, that's 450 euros total. - And buy what? - A two-stroke, more of a cross bike. That would be cool, cos the big one conks out in the field. It's not that bad. I'd like to have Pichon's bike. The big one, isn't that a Suzuki? No, it's a Yamaha. - Yes, it's a lovely house. - Yes. This whole region is magnificent. Where I live is a bit... Do you have the cadastral survey? No, their father kept them. What about the roof, is it in good condition? The roof, yes. They replaced it not so long ago, I think. - Yes, it's fine. - All right. I'm sorry. I think we're going to have to adjourn. I'm almost finished, just another five minutes. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. What's he doing? - Excuse me, where are the meters? - Right, I'll go with you. - What is she doing? - How the hell should I know? - Mum? - Yes? - What are you doing? - It's nothing, Thierry. It's just to check what condition the house is in. Are you shitting me? Look, let's leave it at that for today. Could you come back next week? - Yes, yes, no problem. - Great. - So these I keep? - Right, those are for you. - Is there a problem? - No. This is yours. Thank you. - I'll walk you out. - Yes. - There. - OK. Goodbye. What's going on? Goodbye, thank you. What the hell was he doing here? Nothing, Thierry. - What the hell was he doing? - Just to see how much the house is worth. We don't give a shit how much the house is worth, we're not selling it, you got that? So you stop doing your little girl act with your piece-of-shit projects. - OK, Thierry, take it easy. - She has no right to sell it, it's ours. Dad gave it to us. She's got nothing to do with it. You want me to stay here till I croak, is that it? You want me dead? She's not entitled to sell anyway. I let her live in the house, but it's yours. She's had enough from me. She can stay in it, but it's your house. She only cares about money, anyway. We won't let it happen. - Anyway, are you OK? - Yeah. - Here. - Thanks. - Give half to your brother, OK? - OK. - Well, see you, Dad. - See you, buddy. - You need the key? - It's OK. It's probably open on the side. How did it go? What did he say? Nothing. Dinner's ready. Thierry. Fran?ois. Mum, you got 20 euros? No, I'm flat broke. What do you mean, you're broke? I'm out of cash. I spent it all. You can afford to buy yourself lingerie, but when your kids need money, you're out? If you want money, go ask your father. Can I have some water? I think he already gives enough, don't you? Take it. Go ahead. - I'll pay you back. - As usual. Pass me the salad, Thierry, please. How come you're out of money? - I spent it. Do you want salad, Fran?ois? - Don't you get money from Dad? - What do you do with it? - That's enough. Drop it. What do you do with it? Answer me. What do you do with the money? I just spend it. - I spend it on the house. - On the house... - That's a joke! - OK, give it a rest. Who cares? No, let him talk, if he's got things to say. Let him say what he thinks. You really want me to say what I think? - What? - You really want me to say what I think? Sure, express yourself. Dad gives money for us, not for you to have fun with l-don't-know-who or to buy clothes. That money's for us, not for you. See, everything is there. It's close to Bordeaux and Perigord. It's the old Mausac train station, perfect for a B and B. We could put in five bedrooms. I see guests arriving by train in the morning or at night, and we live on the ground floor, with a small dining room... - Here? - Yes, here. And when the weather's nice, we eat outdoors under the chestnut trees. You have to show them, it's beautiful. Look at this. Yes, but I don't know if I can, Jan, it's their childhood home. I know. But what do you want? When I was their age, I was living on my own, earning a living. I don't know what else you need. - Isn't it fantastic? - No, you're right, I have to talk to them. - This is boring. - No, leave it, leave it. You're watching this? It's a drag... I'm sorry. I forgot. Do you know what time it is? Where were you? Nowhere, I just went for a walk. - I can drive you now though. - Forget it. I missed my class. I told you I had a class at three. If you had said something, I could've taken the bus. I am sorry, Thierry, things happen, I forgot. - What were you doing until now? - Nothing, I was in town. Sorry. Where are the keys? They're in there. Just go strut your stuff in town. You really want to sell the house? I don't know, Fran?ois. What would we do, then? Would we go with you? I don't know. Thierry's got his studies and you'll find a job soon. You know, at your age, I was already working. I could go with you, I could help you there. There's loads of things to do in a B and B. What are you doing here? Have you seen my drill? Look, if you've got problems, I can still help you. I mean, I can help you with the upkeep of the house. Mind your own business. Why do you want to sell it? Luc, go home. - Did you stop and think about the kids? - Oh, no, never. You know me. I never think about them. Just go home. You all right? - Have you seen my drill? - It's right here. Thanks. - You need any bits? - No, it's OK, I've got everything. Fran?ois, if you need help, you know where to find me, I'm always there. Yeah, OK. All right, then. Bring it back, I need it for the shutters. Yeah, I'll bring it back. Eleven-eight. Eleven-eight... - I'm going out tonight. - Where to? None of your business. - Please clean up after you're finished. - OK. See you. - Where is she going? - How should I know? Come on, play. What was the score? - Ten-five. - No way! Ten-five, are you crazy? It was fifteen-ten, we just changed serves. No way, we had a three-point spread, something like that. Eight-twelve, it was eight-twelve. No, actually we're neighbours, that's why. I live next door to Jan. Let's not get into details. Why not? They're not details. I'm just saying... There's nothing embarrassing... So it's very recent? - Is this official? - It's the first time we meet. Well, it's our first night out as a couple. We have to toast then! Let's fill the glasses. Hang on. Excuse me! - How rude! - You know it. - Jan is coming to dinner tonight. - Who's Jan? - The neighbour, the Flemish guy. - Why is he coming to dinner? - Did he lend you something? - No. No, I invited him, that's all. I told him you'd both be here. Why did you invite him? I don't know, I just did. - Does that bother you? - No, it's really great! There. That way. Careful, it's very hot. The tomatoes. - You have to put them on like this. - OK, I know. They're gorgeous. - You OK? - Yes. All right. Do you know why lifeguards have stinky hands? You know, lifeguards that mind... swimming pools, that watch over them. - Lifeguards have what? - Stinky hands. They have hands that stink. I thought you said names that stink, I didn't get it. No, stinky hands You know why? "Well, kid, put on your swimming cap!" You see? "Kid, put on your..." This is why they have... I never get jokes. OK, I'll set them up like this. You want me to do something with the sauce? Yes, please. - Hot? - No, it smells strong. That's because... Just a little bit. - Not too much. That's enough. - Not too much. OK. It looks great. Right. That's it. That's good. It's good. - Feels nice. - Yes. Your mother told me she was having a tough time with you. I mean, not easy. She's an amazing woman, your mother. She did everything on her own, just like that. That's quite something. She fought all her life, for you, and other things. You've got a great mother... I can tell you. I think there's a time when kids have to understand that their parents have given them all they could and they have a right to start thinking about themselves again. What are you talking about? Don't you think I'm right? Yeah, so? Your mother... Pascale asked me to come because she has a hard time talking to you. She asked me to be here so we could talk more serenely... What the hell did you tell him? Thierry, she just said that you did not agree with her, that you object to her selling the house and she doesn't understand why. - Why are you saying that? - She just said it was hard. Let's not overreact. How does that have anything to do with you? Excuse me? - Who do you think you are? - I like your mother very much, and I don't like seeing her like this. At your age, you should start understanding certain things. - God damn it! Are you finished? - Jan, it's OK. No, Pascale, it's not OK, it's not at all OK! Don't let yourself be treated this way. You shouldn't talk to your mother that way. Look, I don't have to take any lessons from you. You're not my father. You only know her version. - What is your point of view then, Thierry? - That's none of your business. OK, let's stop now. Jan, it's OK. All right? Let's change the subject. I think I know my mother better than you do. You don't know what she's capable of. I know your mother better than you think. Jan, please, stop. Fran?ois, you understand, don't you? - God damn it! Are you going to shut it? - You're going to calm down! Stop it, stop it, please. Let's eat, it's getting cold. No more talking, we're here to eat. Let's eat. Fran?ois, please eat. I'm going to go home. Please stay, spend the night. No, I'm tired. I'm going home. What am I doing here, Pascale? Why am I here? They're right, you know. You have to sort this out with them. They're adults. They don't need anybody to give them a sermon. OK, all right. But you can still spend the night. It's better this way. It's better for you. Better for them, for everybody. I had a stepfather, I know what it's like. - Please stay, Jan. - It'll be all right, Pascale. It's OK. You shouldn't be at war with your sons. I shouldn't even be asking your opinion. Don't ask, then. Yes, fine, but I still want things to go well. If you want things to go well, don't change anything. How long are you going to keep fucking up my life? Fifteen years I've been killing myself for you. Now I have an opportunity to do what I want with Jan, and I can't! Oh, right, so that's why the Flemish guy was here! I just wanted you to meet him. Why do you bring that arsehole here? What the hell did you tell him? I told him how you are. And he's not an arsehole, you don't even know him. You're the arsehole! Why bring him into our family business? What's it to him? Are you going away with him? He wants to live with me. Well, go to him then. That way, you'll stop being a pain. I am going to go to him. If you hadn't been here, I would have lived differently, - I could have done what I wanted. - And what would that be? - That's none of your business. - Yeah, right. Go fuck yourself. You're getting to be more and more like your father. And mind your language. Stop your bullshit. - You arsehole! - Yeah right, see you. - You just go fuck yourself. - Shut up! What's your problem? - What's yours? - Yeah, just go. Run to your mummy. Were you sleeping? You know what he had the gall to say to me? I don't want to know. I don't want to hear about it, I've had it. It's going to work out. We'll sort it out. You'll sort it out. I have nothing to do with it. It's the house, is that it? I can't leave, so you dump me? Go sort out your problems. Go work things out with your kids, and leave me alone, God damn it. Are you OK, Mum? I'm going to keep the house. - So you're not with your Flemish guy? - OK, Thierry, give it a rest. Good night. You have a stomachache? Just a sore throat, that's all. Could you call work? Tell them I'm not well. Yeah, all right. - I have to go. - Come on, let's go upstairs. - No, I've got a lot of people in there. - I want you. - I can't, I've got a lot of customers. - I want you now. - Stop it. I have to give a class now. No! - I'll wait for you till you're finished. - No. - Why not? I can't, I have work to do. I'll be here till eleven. It's no use waiting. - You'll be here till eleven? - Yeah. - That's bullshit. Are you lying to me? - No, I'm not lying. Great. Have a nice day then. Mum! Mum! - What is it? - I have to be in town in ten minutes. - I have to drive Fran?ois. - Come on, Mum, it's really important. - Why didn't you tell me earlier? - I had forgotten. You forgot, so deal with it. - Come on, Fran?ois! - What do you have to do anyhow? - What's it to you? Come on, Mum, tell him. - Listen, kids, work this out between you. No, Mum, you said you were driving me, so drive me! Go on, get out of here. - You get out of here! - Watch it! Thierry, open that door! - Open it! Open it, Thierry! - Get out of the car! - Get lost! - Will you stop it? Mum! You bitch! - Great! - Fuck you! Where are you going? I'm going to Gerda's. What's going on? I've had it. What are you going to do there? Rest. - It'll work out. - No, it's not going to work out. Your brother is unbearable. He's not going to change. Here, you guys manage with that. When are you coming back? I don't know. Where is she going? I don't know. She left. What do you mean, she left? She left. Yeah, but where to? No idea. Why don't you ask her? - Hello. - Hello. - Is Luc home? - Yes. Luc! Can I speak to you? I'm listening. You need to take care of the kids. That's a new one. Why is that? So you can sell the house behind their backs? No, I don't care about the house. I just need to breathe a little, that's all. What does that have to do with me? I just don't know what to do with them any more. Look, Pascale, you wanted the divorce, you got the divorce. You wanted to be on your own, you got to be on your own. Now you face the music. You don't want me to come and see them, so if they want to see me, they can come here. They're big boys now. Get off, get off! Get the hell off my bike. Fuck you. Your bike! I'm not gonna break it! It's my bike. What am I supposed to do? There's no car. Work something out. It's not my fault. The bike's not insured anyway. Go on, let me borrow it. - No way, I'm not letting you use my bike. God damn it, you really are an arsehole! Take your shit bike! Do that again, I'll break your neck. What, what is it? Shouldn't you call Mum? - For what? - To apologise. Apologise for what? If you miss her, go find her. Can't you keep your mouth shut? You're a fucking pig. Your son is so cute. Yes. He's a little tired. Shall we go to bed? - Good night. - Good night. See you tomorrow. Bye, Anton. See you tomorrow. He is tired, he's rubbing his eyes. Bye-bye. Good night, Anton. You have beautiful eyes, Anton. Don't you? Look at me. They're solid blue. He's eating like a little squirrel. Ouch, he bit me! Did you bite me, Anton? What are you doing? It's the rats. They piss me off. Do you know where Pascale is? No. - When will she be home? - Don't know. - She didn't tell you? - No. If you see her, please tell her I came by, OK? Yes. Hello? Hello? Hello? Mum? Mum? - Are we stressing a little? - Stop, stop. Hi. - I'm Anne. - Fran?ois. - You're a cook now? - Very funny. So you guys are twins? You don't look alike. We're not identical twins. Funny, there is a resemblance... in the chin. Thanks. Who's the eldest then? Me. - You came out first? - Yes. He was lagging in the back. Yeah, sure! He didn't want to come out of his mum's womb. Anyway, the first one to be conceived is the last one to come out. Thank you. That's cool. I mean, it must be fun to be twins. I don't have any brothers or sisters. You guys must be super close. Aren't you? - A little wine? - Thanks. Thanks. - Do you want some? - Yes. Thanks. Come on, eat up. One twin is supposed to be more like the father and the other like the mother. - Yeah, Thierry is more like Dad. - Yeah. And he's becoming more and more like my mother. - Aren't you eating? - No, it's OK. Well, let's share then. When is your mother coming back? When he calms down. You like it? Shit. Pisses me off. It doesn't matter. - Sugar? - No, thanks. Thierry spent the whole afternoon at our birthday party, showing off in his Superman suit. There he goes... Superman! With his red cape and everything. Totally nuts. Then he drinks lemonade and he's got to piss. He goes to the bathroom, but he's got no zip, nothing. So he's trying to pull his suit off from the back. He can't make it and he's starting to piss himself. Something awful. He comes back and sits down. We're all going, "Yeah, Superman! "Come on, Superman, fly!" What is it? What's so funny? What were you talking about? Fly, Superman. What are you laughing about? I can tell funny stories about him too. You want me to, Fran?ois? I know a ton of funny stuff about him. - What did he tell you? - Nothing, just kid stuff. - Come on, tell me. - It's nothing. Everything OK? You need a hand? Stop it. Stop it. Are you getting a hard-on? Stop it. That's enough. I'm leaving. - Wait. - Let me go. Shit, Anne. Come on, Anne! I don't want to waste my time with little kids. It's him. He should just go to his room. - Right, I'm out of here. - Anne, don't. See you. Come on, stay... Anne. "Anne, come back!" Fran?ois? Fran?ois? Fran?ois? Hello, Dad? There's been an accident with Fran?ois. He fell. She's not here. Thierry! Thierry! Thierry! What happened? Thierry, are you OK? He came over. Do you know how Fran?ois is doing? No, I don't know anything. I have no news. Sorry. - How is he? - I don't know. They told us to go. - Is Thierry in? - Yes, he's up in his room. You want me to stay? - What did he tell you? - Nothing. You didn't say anything? Look at me! Why did you hit him? - Let me go! - Why did you hit him? - Let me go! - Why did you hit him? Let go of me, God damn it! Look at me! - Why did you hit him? - Get off! - Why? Look at me! - Let go of me! - Break it up! - Why did you hit him? Fuck off, you bitch! And you! She screwed you, she took everything and you let her do it. - She's a bitch! - You calm down now. Do you hear me? Enough is enough, damn it. Your mother is not a bitch, and nobody got screwed, OK? We just tried, and it didn't work out. That's all. Subtitles by LeapinLar
