[suspenseful music] [wind whistling] [waves crashing] - She still alive? - Not for long. Come here. - Too bad, she's so pretty. - Nah. - Oh, come on, she was pretty. - She's all right. [hand thudding] The car is pretty. [van door slams] [truck slams] [car engine roars] [waves crashing] [engine revving] - There's somebody over there. - That's them, maybe. [engine revving] Let's take a look. [bumpers thud] [intense music] [engine revving] [van thudding] [explosion thunders] - That's them! - Hands up! [car door slams] [suspenseful music] [guns firing] [man groans] [car engine roars] [guns firing] [tires screeching] [officer groans] [suspenseful music] [engine roars] [tires screeching] [fire crackling] [tense music] [light thuds] [radio beeping] [fingers tapping] - B14 to headquarters. [buttons clicking] This is Al Romero. Come in. - [Dispatcher] Read you, over. - North on Route 21, 11 mile mark, officer down. It's my partner, Carlos Rivas, badly wounded out at Muller's Point. And one perpetrator also wounded. But you must show at Muller Crossing - [Dispatcher] Units B34 and C5 in the area of related interchange, they're waiting for instructions, should I put them through? - No, wait a second, I'll call you back. - North on Route 21, 11 mile mark, officer down. It's my partner, Carlos Rivas, badly wounded out at Muller's Point. Get me that [indistinct]. - [Dispatcher] Who the hell's that? - Captain Badal. - This is Badal. - Officer Carlos Rivas badly wounded, and one suspect also wounded. Set up a roadblock. We got him. - [Badal] Description of the car? - It's a Jag, a gray Jaguar. I got the plate. It's W1723EO. That's W1723EO. - [Dispatcher] Got it, okay, over and out. [suspenseful music] [car engine roars] - You got it? - [Woman] It's so funny, I was just going to call you back, my hand was right on the phone. Are you running in diplomatic circles now, inspector? - Okay, who's car is it? - [Woman] It's registered to a Mr. Thomas Radeck, Columbian Consul. [suspenseful music continues] [car engine roars] - Got your ass now, prick. [car engine roars] [tires screeching] [radio buttons clicking] B14 to headquarters. - [Badal] Badal here. - Nobody at the intersection, what happened? - [Badal] Wouldn't [indistinct] - Yeah, all right, don't worry. I've got this son of a bitch. - [Badal] Let him go. - What? I got him! I said, got him! - [Badal] Let him go, Romero. - What can I do back there? I got the guy who did it. Let me put him away. - [Badal] Romero, you have your orders. Get back and take care of the corpse and your partner. [tires screeching] [handbrake rasps] [handbrake clicks] [car engine roars] [indistinct radio chatter] - He's gone, I'm sorry. - Shit! Did you tell Maria? - Not yet. - So long, man. I'll do it. - You'll do what? - I'll talk to Maria. You know where she is? - She's working on the missing American girls sting, with the Anti-Drug Force. Luis Barbosa, that's another scumbag who was in drugs. - She's got needle marks all over, in her goddamn neck. Poor kid. [knocking on door] - Captain, there's someone waiting to see you. - Let him wait, I'm busy! I'd like to speak to Don Thomas. Look, Badal calling. [phone rings] - Hello. No, this is his personal assistant, Chucho. Don Thomas is in a meeting right now, he can't be disturbed. - This is Inspector Badal. Please tell Don Thomas that one of your men is leaving Consul [indistinct]. He's driving a car which belongs to Don Thomas. [gentle piano music] We checked it from the license plate. Tell Don Thomas that I have done my best. That that is kind of mistake can't happen again, I'm not the chief of police, nor the Minister of the Interior. And this kind of thing- - [Chucho] All right, all right, you have my word, this won't happen again. - And I must clean up- - [Chucho] I will. Goodbye. - He's as oily as a snake. What did he want anyway, essentially? - It's Flores, he must've gotten rid of a girl, and he offed a cop. And he let them see the plates on one of our cars. - I never want to hear from him again. Never. All right? - Okay. [soft piano music continues] - [Chief of police] Well, we've been waiting for you. - I'm sorry for the interruption, but it seems that one of my employees, at the consolute had a little car trouble. - Nothing serious, I hope. - I hope not. May I have a review with the bidding please? - His Honor opened two diamonds, two spades, Juno trumps. - [Thomas] Fine. - Four spades. [sirens wailing] [car doors slamming] [sirens wailing] - Excuse me. - Wait a minute. - All right, I'm sorry. - No, I know, I know, I know! We- - I had him! He's one of those assholes dealing drugs to little girls, pimps them, and then kills them off when they get outta line! He killed my partner! And I had the son of a bitch! - Easy! There was no time. We didn't have a car anywhere around. - Then why'd you call me off? I had him. [hand slams] - Because I lost one of my best guys tonight, that's enough for me. I didn't want to lose you too. - What about the car? - Stolen. Registered to an ambassador or something. He reported the theft a few days ago. [Al scoffs] - Want one? - I'm on the wagon. One second, I'll be right with you. Is officer Maria Mendoza back yet? Thanks. She already knows about Carlos. - Who told her? - Who knows. Some diplomat, maybe. Would you like a cup of coffee? - No. Thank you. - You still haven't heard from your wife? - No. - Come with me. - If Maria calls, I'm in the cooler. - [Vinny] Roger. - You already saw her, didn't you? - Yeah, but I'd like you to show this man both of the girls they brought in today. - [Coroner] There were three. - It's cold in here. - You're right. [tense music] - OD's? All three? - [Coroner] It looks that way. [Paul belches] - Excuse me. - The entertainment's not so great in this place. - You think my wife will end up like that? - Maybe not. Maybe she's just getting it on with some guy who's better looking than you. - What? - No, nothing. I'm sorry, had a bad day. - I'd thank God. - Hmm? - If that's where she's gone, if that's what she's doing, I'd get done on my knees and thank God that she's alive, and that's all. - You're sure she was a user? And it's been two weeks since she disappeared? - 15 days. - Why don't you go home, I'll let you know when we find something. - Go home. Yeah. I've just been away. [lighter rasps] We got married six months ago. I didn't know she used drugs. She thought that our love would help her get her straight. - How old did you say she was? - 20. [Paul coughing] I don't smoke. - Come up to the office, we'll get a cup of coffee. - Hi, Flores. - Chucho, You scared the hell outta me. What the hell's wrong with you? Turn the headlights off, you're blinding me. - You had a little accident tonight. - You say that like I shit in my pants. [Flores scoffs] I had to get rid of a girl, that's all. It was crazy. He jumped out in front of my car and yelled "stop". Chucho, did you think I was gonna pull over and show 'em my license? - But you left your business card, man. [fingers snap] - Shit, the damn cover came off. So, you come to chew me out because the old man got mad? Turn those lights off, will you? - They make you nervous? - Come on, stop playing around. I get the message, I fucked up. Don't worry about it. Chucho, you remember when we got caught stealing that car when we was kids. - I remember. - Boy, did we ever fuck up that time, hey? It was worth it, though. Remember that car? It was a pretty car. [guns firing] [Flores groans] [knees thud] - Pretty car. [gun fires] - It was a fucking Chevy, Flores. - Thanks for everything. - Don't mention it. I'll call you as soon as we get a lead. - In any case, if you don't mind, I'll come back to see how you're doing, I don't have much else to do. - Sure. Maria. [lips smacking] - You feeling better? - Hi. - Hi. - Paul. Paul Boles. - What's going on? - They told you, right? - I came soon as I could. You need me for the identification. - Yes. - Okay. Hi. - Hi. - This one too? - Yeah. [tense music] - Carlos! [Maria sobs] - We were at Muller's Point, they opened fire at us. - You son of a bitch! You let him die, you son of a bitch. How could you do it? You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! You let him die! [crying] [eerie music] [people chattering] - They just tell me you were here. I'm sorry. - Maria, come with me. - Captain, we've got a possible homicide at the harbor, and a car that [indistinct] description. - [hand slams] Get them there! Um, you can stay here and see to Maria. - I'm going down, I wanna see if it's the car I was chasing. Can you wait for her? - I got nothing else to do. [sirens wailing] [upbeat jazz music] - Good evening, detective. I saw the whole thing. - Are you the one who called? - He was too drunk to see the numbers, I had to dial. - I was coming out of the Barking Dog, I was having a glass of milk. - Milk, my arse. - Will you please shut up, I'm telling you a story. - That's him. He's the one that killed Carlos. - [Drunk man] Guns rang out like thunder. I hid among the bushes. And did I mention that I am a pacifist? And then the cars came rolling up like butterflies. - [Sailor] Rolling up like butterflies? - Butterflies flutter, they don't roll. - Will you, please. If I'm saying the butterflies roll, they damn well gonna roll. Like I was saying, the two cars come fluttering, and two guys come up and dump that poor bastard in the fish. Then they leave so quick they forgot one of their cars. - Search him. If you find a ring, arrest him. - You cut off his damn finger, you stupid old drunk. - He wasn't using it. - Take them both in. [commentating in foreign language] - Good night. - I'll ask you to take you home. That is if you don't mind. - That is nice of you, but I'll manage. [Maria sighs] It wouldn't be too much trouble? Where you from? - California, San Francisco. - It's cold. You a friend of Al Romeros'? - Not exactly. - He's a nice guy, he's... He was my husband's best friend. That's the one, the brick. - You wouldn't wanna have a cup of coffee? - No thanks. - Sorry, I understand. - What's your name? - Paul. Paul Boles. - Bye, Paul. Your scarf. - It's Allyson's scarf. I hope she'll be able to wear it. - Why do you say that? - She's been missing for two weeks. - Drugs? I think I'll have that cup of coffee, I can't face going home. [elegant piano music] - [Paul] Maria, make yourself at home. - Is that her? She's very pretty. [leaves rustling] [wind howling] - Maria! [elegant piano music continues] - Have you been married long? - No long, no. - I was married six years. We were planning to have a baby next year. We had waited. We were both very busy working. - Allyson was... I hope to God she still is pregnant. - [Maria] How'd you meet her? - We met in New Orleans. I was doing a session, and she comes in while I'm doing a solo. - When'd she get into drugs? - I didn't know anything about that. You know, you see things. How money disappears. But I thought that was all over long ago. She said she wanted to make a new start. She said if I was strong enough I could help her. I guess I wasn't strong enough. A couple of months ago I had to go back to the States to see this guy I know about doing the music for a movie, I was only gone a couple of days, but when I got back it was different. She'd met somebody. - Do you mean another guy? - Yeah. I mean, no. Another girl. They went everywhere together. Got to the point where we hardly saw each other. So I asked her, "What the hell was going on?" She told me, nothing. For a few weeks it was fine again. Like it used to be. Then, after a while, she started going out again. Late at night, no explanation. So one night I found some works on the floor in the bathroom. I was gonna scream at her, tell her she was throwing everything away for nothing. I waited up all night long, but she never came home. She still hasn't come home. - Paul, can I tell you something? I work for the antidrug unit in the police department. So did Al Romero and Carlos, until they got transferred. The thing is, we were working on identifying the high-level dealers. Only, we had a lot of trouble getting evidence. Then came the transfers. You see what I'm getting at? - You mean the police are in on this? - Yeah. In on it or bought off. - But the antidrug is a part of the police, isn't it? - Well, it's supposed to be independent, but. [Paul sighs] - You can't trust anybody. - Myself, Al, maybe one or two others beyond that. Can I make a phone call? - Sure. [phone dial whirring] - Maria Mendoza speaking. Yes. Okay, thanks. Fine. I've got a few days off. If there's anything I can do for you, please let me know. - All right. Can I take you home? - Thanks, I'm really feeling much better, I'd like to walk a bit. - All right. - Maria, what can I do? - Go to the U.S. Embassy, bang on the table until they do something. - I already did. They swear they're doing all they can. - Why don't you try finding the girl? - You mean Melissa? - Yeah. - But she wasn't seeing her anymore. - Are you sure? [wind howling] [downbeat saxophone music] [moves to upbeat jazz music] [moves to downbeat jazz music] [horn honking] [dogs barking] [soft music] - Aren't you ashamed to be seen like that? - Why should I be? You are the first man who ever saw me naked. - I don't remember. - How could you forget, it was my birthday. - Ah, but that's not the same thing. You we're fat, pink, ugly, and you were screaming. - [Lupita] Can I have the sports car? - You have the will? No. - Why not? - I made inquires. No money, no education, common family. - Yeah, but it's a Valenti. [hand slaps] - Mind your mouth, young lady. [soft music continues] - Dad! Okay? - Take the car, but be careful, don't let that dummy near the wheel. - That nosy cop is here to see you. - I told you I didn't want to see him. - I spoke to the inspector, it's just about the report on the stolen car. - Oh. I'll talk to him. But it seems like you can't live in this country anymore without the government poking its nose into your business. [soft music continues] - You're gonna take that little jerk out for a spin? - What is it to you, pussface? - Officer. - Early Mason, very nice, very expensive. - You're an art connoisseur? - Actually, I don't have much of a chance to move in those circles. - Police work must be very difficult? - [Al] You should see some of the characters we have to talk to. - My assistant tells me you're here on business. - That's right, just routine. It appears there'd been some mistake on your report, on the stolen car. - My secretary takes care of this sort of thing. What kind of a mistake? - Your car was stolen on February 3rd. Is that right? - I suppose so. - No. - Here you are getting out of the stolen car to go to the OMS party. Do you remember that? - I think so. - The OMS party was on February 4th. - Quite right, officer, there appears to be an error in the date. - Of course. - My secretary will go to bed without his supper. - I'll release the car for you. - Fine. Will that be all? - One more thing. [plastic rustling] This. No. Is this yours? - I don't believe so. - Sure it is, sure. See.. Here's the bill on the jewelers. Expensive. It will probably cost more than the painting - Of course, I remember this ring now. - Of course you will. If you'll just sign the receipt for it. Read it. The description is- - I trust our police department. - You are very trustworthy. Don't you wanna know how we found it? - Naturally. - We found it, reported by a drunk who have cut a finger off a corpse with a jackknife to get it. - Gruesome. You do move in different stories. - You know whose? - Who's what? - Whose corpse? It was a certain Flores Fuentes. Did you know him? - The name means nothing to me. - Of course not. You wouldn't know anybody like that. He was a cheap gangster, a murder, and a car thief, not your type. - That's an interesting story. Will that be all now? - For the moment. - Thank you very much for all you've done, officer. I'll send a check to the Police Benevolent Association. - You're a real nice guy, Don. [soft music continues] - How the hell did Flores get his hands on this ring? - Maybe you ought to ask Lupita. - What would she know about that creep? [sighs] Encourageable little... She reminds me of her mother. - B14 to headquarters. [radio hisses] B14 to headquarters. Let me speak to Badal. [radio hisses] - [Badal] Badal. - I just saw him. He's a nice guy, just like you said, he was very polite. He's even going to send a check to the PBA, isn't that great? - [Badal] I told you, he's a nice boy. - He's one of the nicest pricks I ever met. [car engine roars] [metal clanging] [buttons clicking] [fist thudding] Is this the Marine Life Conservation Group? I like to speak to Mr. Steve Brevin. I'm calling long distance. [phone rings] - Brevin here. - This is amigo. Your were right. - [Steve] Then you can help us? - Carlos can't do much. - Sorry. Okay, I'll be down in about three days, in the meantime you can get things rolling with Operation Marine Life. Got everything you need? - I hope so. - See you soon, amigo. - [Al] See you later. [phone thuds] [knocking on door] - Come in. - Jeff. - [Jeff] What's up, Steve? - You got a minute? - Yeah. Come on in. - What's up, Steve? - Well, I'm ready to put Operation Marine Life into action. - Didn't you just lose an amigo? - Yeah, unfortunately, but now his partner is ready to step in. And that's the guy I was telling you about. - [Jeff] Oh, why don't you give it a few days, Steve? - A few days? For God sakes, Jeff. I mean, we're averaging six OD's a day, every day, in this country alone. - Steve, all I'm saying to you, that if you'd like to- - We're talkin' about human lives. And we can't just sit on our butts and do nothin'. And we gotta at least try and put a stop to it. - But, Steve, all I am saying- - What's the matter, Jeff, did you get another phone call from upstairs? I thought you were gonna make those DA big shots put up or shut up, back 'em up against the wall. Always had a lot of bureaucratic bullshit. - Now listen, Steve, calm down. Here. - What's that? - Take it. - You're gonna need some expenses, aren't you? - Well it's a start, but uh, [smirks] it won't be enough. - [chuckles] It never is. - You won't regret it, Jeff. Thanks. - And Steve, you'll remember, I want Thomas brought here alive. I want to take a look at this son of a bitch. - You'll see him, Jeff, warts and all. [suspenseful music] [chain clinking] [suspenseful music continues] - Melissa? Melissa! Anybody home? Melissa! Melissa! [birds flutter] Melissa! - Get out of here or I burn your face off, you bastard! - Excuse me, miss, I'm looking for Melissa. - Are you a friend of her? - [Paul] Are you her mother? - Grandmother! - I'm a friend of your granddaughter. - Let you call yourself a friend, you bastard! You and the rest, what have you done with my granddaughter? - Please, let me explain. I'm looking for my wife, and she was very friendly with Melissa. I thought she could help me find her. - You know? You know what she did to me? She hit to me, that's what. Her own grandmother, an old woman. That's not her. That's not my Melissa. - Do you know where I can find her? - If she ever comes back here, I kill her. But she's too chicken, they made her like that. She wasn't chicken before. - Who made her like that? What are their names? - The junkies of the cemetery, that's who. - Cemetery? What's this cemetery? - It's where they bury dead people. It's where the kids are. And it's called The Cemetery. - You want me to tell her something? - Yes. Tell her I said, "Go fuck yourself!" [suspenseful music] - Nice car, cop. Nice car, cop. - Look, I'm not a cop. I'm looking for Melissa. [kid with white hat speaking in foreign language] - He don't understand. - He don't understand. - [Paul] No. Look, at least- - Do we smiley to him? - Give the a smiley to him! - I just- Come on, man, I just wanna talk to Melissa, okay? - Cops aren't welcome here this often. We got sort of an understanding. - We got sort of an understanding. - Look, I told you, I'm not a cop. - You guys, you don't understand. He's just looking for a little action. - I just want to talk to Melissa, that's all. - He's no cop. - Thank you. - Cop or no cop, I think we'll take you down. - Take him down. [kids chuckling] - Go! Go there. - No. Come on, please, come on. [kids chattering] [growling] - Let him go, he's a friend of mine. You two, fuck off. - You're gonna give this cop a freebie, Melissa? - A freebie, Melissa. - Come with me. - Do you know where Alison is? - Where she is? - [Paul] She's been missing for 17 days. - I haven't seen her. I thought she went straight. I thought that she went with you. - When did you see her last? - About three weeks ago. She was with a guy, her dealer, I think. I was high, I don't remember. - You're dying, Melissa. - All our lives we're dying. - Eh! Take it easy. Who the hell do you think you are? - [Junkie] I'm right here, cop, don't get smart. [knocking on window] Don't get smart, cop. - You're right, you don't understand. [suspenseful music] Do you know why we call this The Dead Bus? Because, one day, it was driving some little kids to school, no traffic, no rain, and just like that, for no reason, it ran over into this turnover, and all the little kids go to heaven. You know what they found out? The driver didn't stop. He was high, the motherfucker. [sobbing] And one of those little kids was my own son. The man was high, see? [Melissa sighs] [Melissa sobbing] Come on, I take you to Allyson place. - [Paul] What do you mean, Allyson's place? - [Melissa] We all have a coffin. - [Paul] A coffin? - A car. It wasn't like her to show us. Maybe she left something. It's the best car. Allyson has expensive taste. [paper rustling] - "At the night's end, that's when my dreams become too much [indistinct]." [pole clanging] [tense music] Ugh! Ugh! Allyson! [Junkie barking] [Paul retching] [Paul retching] - His name! The dealer! - No. - Melissa, he killed her! - Okay, I take you there. [junkie barking] - Hey. Melissa! Melissa! You are fucking crazy! Come back! - You fucking better come back. - Did you see what they did to Allyson? - She was fucking around! - Fucking around! [Junkie] Melissa, you're fucking crazy. Come back here. [suspenseful music] [engine roars] [truck clanking] - Uh, yes, uh, chief. Yes, uh. No, ballistics was very firm. Seven shots, three different guns. I said three. Right. It seem unlikely, it was two guys who found the body. Three guns, and only two guys. - You mean one of them had two guns and found them both at the same time. Excuse me, chief, this was a drunk and an old sailor. - We have motive for theft. One of the guns. The knife they actually used to cut off the finger. We got opportunity. They were with the body. As for the guns, maybe there was a third accomplice. - [Badal] I suppose it's possible. - The evidence is all there, Badal. Now let the courts do their duty. - [Badal] But I can't consent. - Detective, your consent doesn't come in to it, anymore than it did when you committed statutory rape. Now, I have done all I can to keep that quiet for you, because I hate to see a man's career go down the drain over some silly misunderstanding. But if you can't put away two suspects with all this evidence, I'm wondering, what could your career- - Yeah, chief. All right, I understand. I stay in line. - Badal, I can sympathize with your attraction for school girls, but you don't have to act like one. Look, I tell you what, why don't we just forget about it? Goodbye. - Wait, don't hang up. I think I see your logic. I'll do the necessary. - We got a tough job ahead of us, Badal. I know I can count on you to help restore confidence, to handle all the attacks of the press, even from their own minister. We have all the hard problems. Drugs, murder, rape. - They have brought it for you [indistinct] - Drugs - That's nice, you don't have to worry about me. [lips smacking] - You want the car, or money? - Yes. - Both. - [chuckles] I always said I'm smart, daddy. - Where are you going? - Out with friends. - What happened to what's his name? - What's his name was a jerk. [car keys jingling] [Lupita giggles] - Ah, Lupita. - Yes? - May I talk to you about something? - Sure. - You don't ever fool around with drugs, do you? - Drugs users are stupid little people with no imagination. - I'm relieved to hear you say. - How can I do something so stupid when I have everything I want? And a father who loves me so much. [people chattering] [phone slams] [sirens wailing] - Nobody here? - I'm here. - I mean, no one else? - Disturbances. - Huh? - At the demonstration. I'm holding down the fort. - Ah. - I just sort of spoke with the chief of police. - I know. - You know? - You left the door open. - You heard everything? - [Al] Everything. - Are you going to report me? - To who? The chief of police? - I'm ashamed of this, Al. - Good for you. - Say what you're thinking. I'm correct, it's allowed. - That's what I used to think. Now I just think you're an asshole. - They got me by the balls. - Everybody knows about the girl, Badal. And everyone knows who raped who. - She was a minor. - She was a whore. - Everyone knows. - You're an idiot. You're so busy trying to save your arse, you don't even notice when they cut off your balls. - I have got a wife. Two kids. - And what do the kids think of their dad? - What can I do? - One, you don't frame those guys for a murder they didn't do. And two, show up tomorrow morning at Maria Mendoza's house. - What time? [phone dial whirring] - Maria. How are you holding up? Our friend arrives tomorrow. Can we meet at your house? Okay. See you then. 10 o'clock. I'll just be a minute. Please take this. [people chattering] Please. Please! Mr. Paul Boles, please. - Mr. Paul Boles has just left, officer. - Did he get my messages? - If you left him a message, I'm sure he would have received it, or we'll receive it and carry it on. - What kind of crappy hotel is this? - Please, officer. He just came in a few minutes ago, but he went out again right away. He had a lady waiting for him in the car. I told him I had messages, but he evidently didn't want to keep her waiting. - Did you get a look at the lady? - She was rather rough looking. Bold hair, hot pants, uh, like a tiger. - Okay. Thanks. - Patty, Patty, Patty something! [upbeat jazz music] [truck thuds] - That's him. - Are you sure? - Of course. Every night he's whoring, fucking around and marketing his shit in clubs. Now he's going to the Tobacco Garden. They call him "The Cowboy." - But you're sure? - He's other name is Ilrosso. I'm sure, I introduced him to Allyson. [upbeat music] [Paul breathing heavily] What are you doing with that? - [breathing heavily] What do you think? - Paul! Wait! What are you doing? Wait! [car door slams] [feelgood music] [people chattering] [feelgood music continues] - Hey! Who are you? - [inhales] I'm Allyson's husband. - Allyson who? [knife thuds] [drug dealer groans] [people screaming] [feelgood music continues] [indistinct chattering] [people screaming] - He killed Cowboy - Paul! - [Male voice] Get him. Quick. Get away. [shoes stomping] - Ugh! - Take that, you fucker. [fists thudding] [shoes thudding] - You motherfucker. - Get him, bitch. [indistinct chattering] - [Male voice] Take that, bitch. - Get him. - Asshole. - B14 to headquarters. I need help in Tobacco Gardens area. [car engine roars] - [Male voice] Leave my brother alone, motherfucker. [shoes thudding] [indistinct chattering] [junkies whistling] - [Male voice] Come on. [car engine roars] [indistinct chattering] - Police, got to move. [gun fires] - Melissa! Melissa, what the fuck is wrong with you? - We all knew you. - [indistinct]. Bitch! - [Male voice] He killed [indistinct]. - He killed The Cowboy, I saw him. - If he killed someone I'll take car of it. [engines roar] [sirens wailing] [handcuffs snap] [feelgood music] [sirens wailing] [police speaking in foreign language] [tires screeching] [police speaking in foreign language] [anxious music] [engine revving] - Melissa! [indistinct shouting] Stupid bitch, come back here. Melissa! Stop, fucking stop. [indistinct shouting] [bike engine revving] [indistinct shouting] [indistinct shouting] Melissa! Come back! Melissa! Come back! [bike engine roars] [Melissa screams] [glass shattering] - A couple of more minutes with those guys, I'd be scraping you off the sidewalk. - I might have been better off. What are the prisons like in this country? - Hell. They're like hell. - Guess I'll know soon enough. [keys jingle] I don't understand. - You will. [handcuffs clinking] - I Think that's him. [door clicks] - Come in. I'm Maria Mendoza. - Maria, pleasure. - Hello, amigo. - Hi, Al, good to see you. - This is Paul Boles, I told you about him. - Ah. Paul, how are you? I understand to got yourself a little scrape last night. - I found the dead body of my wife in the trunk of a car. I tracked down the drug deal who killed her. Slash his throat. And got beat practically to death by his goons when they caught up with me. - Uh, would anyone want some coffee? - Oh, yes. Thanks, Maria. - Sit down. - Is Inspector Badal gonna join us? - I hope so. - It takes a lotta guts to go through with a decision like that. We'd better start without him. - [Al] He's basically a good- - Al, we'll go without him. Now, as you know, the idea is to concentrate on the three main targets. I don't want anybody distracted by some nickel and dime bag type, even though we have very good personal reasons to go after them. Understood? - So, there's Don Thomas, the chief of the police, and the bank guy, what's his name? - Luis Betancourt, president of The Central Bank. They call him Bleach, because he leaves grimy drug money smelling clean and fresh. - You know, once we put this plan into action, there's no turnin' back. I wanna be sure that you're all in this to the end. Have you got any doubts, anybody wants out, now's the time. Maria? - I'm in. - Al? - You know how I feel about it. - Paul? - I'll do whatever you tell me, and I'll die trying. - Now, we've gotta act fast. Romero and this Betancourt, they're no problem. But as to Don Thomas, he's mine. I plan on taking him back alive. - To the States? [scoffs] You can just walk in and take him out alive. I mean, this guy's got more cops and bodyguards than President Bush. - Yeah, I know. But he's also got a daughter he loves more than money. A daughter I understand that runs around a lot without bodyguards. Okay. [door bell buzzes] [gun snaps] - I'm sorry I'm late. I had something to take care of. [gentle guitar music] [female vocalizing] [water sploshing] - Wanna take a walk? - If you want to. [gentle guitar music continues] [tense music] My father didn't want me to take the convertible, I was pissed off. But you know, it's nice. In private. [tense music continues] - [Guy in car] What? [pistol thuds] [guy in car groans] - One sound and I'll blow your brains out. [tense music continues] [car door slams] [car engine roars] [gentle guitar music] - There's a girl who knows what she wants. - What about you? You know what you want? - No! [suspenseful music] [phone rings] - [sighs] What is it? - [Chucho] I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's an urgent call. - Are you crazy, it's the middle of the night. - [Chucho] It's from your daughter. [suspenseful music continues] - She's not back yet? - [Chucho] No, sir. - Put the call through. - [Male voice] Don Thomas? - Yes. - [Male voice] Lupita was driving the sedan tonight. - Who is this? - [Male voice] If you want to see her again, you'll follow our orders. - What orders? - Calling back at noon. Call the police if you like, it won't make any difference. [phone clicks] - Chucho! Chucho! - May I help you, sir? - Get Chucho in here now! [ball clanging] [elegant music] [tape ripping] - Did you wanna say something? - Why don't you untie my hands, I can do incredible things with my hands. - And what about your mouth? - Yes, that too. I can show you a good time while we're waiting. - That sounds very exciting, Lupita. - Ah, come on, untie my hands. Anyway, my father won't let me stay here too much longer. - You know what, Lupita? - What? - Save it for someone who appreciate you. - Bastard! - No, your father's the bastard. That's why you're here. But if you have to go to the bathroom, just bang your head against the wall three times. [elegant music continues] [knocking on glass] - It's time to call. [ball whirrs] - Thomas Radeck, please. If you would like to see your daughter alive again, be at the opera house tonight at 10 o'clock, you'll receive further instructions. - Shoot. [phone slams] - It was too short, I couldn't trace it. - Fuck me. Who could it be, what do they want? - We'll get them, we've got the whole police force. - Well, whoever they are, they certainly knew how to get to me. - We have to see the chief of police, it's an emergency. [people chattering] - Sir. - Captain Badal. The police chief box. - Box number three. [dramatic music] [singing in foreign language] - What the hell are you doing here, I told you to watch the hall. - Come on, go in the hall! - Okay, sir. [lighter clicking] [dramatic music continues] [singing in foreign language] [fist thuds] [dramatic music continues] [singing in foreign language] [hand smacks] [people gasping] [police chief screams] [body thuds] [people screaming] [gun fires] - Run for it! [gun fires] [people screaming] - Don't go out. - I want to know what's happening! - Don Thomas. They killed the chief of police. He's knifed. [paper rustling] [tense music] - "We weren't kidding. We don't want money, we want you. Follow instructions you will receive at dawn or your daughter comes back in pieces." [tense music] - [Paul] It's a little strange, isn't it? We're gonna kill someone who we don't even know. - Did you know The Cowboy? - I don't know. He reminds me of somebody. - Look, this guy kills people he doesn't know everyday. Kids. Without him all this drug money would just be paper. - My friend. They killed my friend. [indistinct mumbling] He was such a nice guy. - Come on. - They killed my friend. They killed my friend. My friend. My friend. My friend. What? We are being followed. - It's a police car. - Hi, thanks for seeing us home. - Don't mention it. [guns firing] [Betancourt groans] [dog barking] [Betancourt groans] - Mendoza to headquarters. Shot fired on Truhilio Avenue. [gun fires] [Betancourt groans] [suspenseful jazz music] - I never felt so powerless. - We'll get them. - We don't even know who they are. They competition? Politics, maybe. - [Chucho] We'll know soon enough. - Will you stop talking like that! My daughter's life is at stake. If it's me they want, it's me they'll get. - You can't do that. - You watch me. [car engine roars] [body thuds] [tires screeching] [suspenseful music continues] - Another envelope. [paper rustling] - "We weren't kidding. We have killed two of your friends. We want you. Go to the phone booth at Royan Square with one man, no more. Otherwise you daughter gets an envelope." - They're crazy, you can't go through with it. - Would you like to come with me? [birds chirping] - Go peacefully. [buttons clicking] - Hello? Yes. I'd like to speak with officer Al Romero, please. Yes, it's Paul Boles calling. [typewriter clicking] - Al, there's a Mr. Boles on line two. - Again, Panchito. Thanks, Vinny. This is Al Romero. How are you feeling, Mr. Boles? - No, there's nothing new. We're doing the best we can. Okay. 10 o'clock would be best. See you. Bye. It was what's his name? Boles. The guy with the wife by the junkyard. - Ah. Yes, chief, yes. We're doing everything by the book. What on earth do you want? [suspenseful music] - Without him we're finished, we can't let him go through with it. Keep it safe, when the car stops get ready. The tracking signal's already planted under the dashboard. - Let's go. What were you doing? - [Chucho] My girlfriend. - I didn't know you had a girlfriend. - I try to keep business separate from my personal life. - Intelligent. - Okay, let's go. [hands clap] Now you all know what we have to do. [curtain thuds] There are the weapons. And I hope you don't have to use 'em all. - I hope we do need all this stuff. - Phone was ready? - [Al] Ready. - Okay, get her in, come on. - [Mendoza] Is that how you're planning to get Don Thomas back to the States? - At least as far as the Mexican border. - What are the prisons like in the States? - Not too pleasant. With any kinda luck at all, he'll spend the rest of his life in prison. - Yeah, with any luck at all. [suspenseful music continues] - Lock it up. - You all right? - I was just thinking. - About Carlos? I was just thinking about Allyson. [suspenseful music continues] - Let me go instead of you. - No, Chucho, it wouldn't work. - What could they want? - I suppose they want to kill me. - They won't. - Don't do anything foolish. I could mean Lupita's life. - Yeah, what about your life? - Haven't you ever loved anyone? What if it were your girlfriend? What if it were her? - Right. [phone ringing] - Yes. - [Male voice] Take the small radio receiver above the door. [phone pings] - [Lupita] Daddy. Daddy. - [Male voice] Drive to the Sierra Bridge. You have two minutes. [switch clicks] [car engine roars] - The Sierra Bridge. [tense music] - [Lupita] Daddy! - Don Thomas. You and your man will leave the car and walk slowly to the middle of the bridge. That's where the exchange will take place. Don't try anything foolish. There's a rifle trained on your daughter. - Throw down your gun. [tense music continues] [gun thuds] The little one too. Do as they say. [Chucho sighs] [gun thuds] - Oh come on. [door clicks] You sure you wanna do this, inspector? - It's a chance to see an old friend of mine. - Go ahead. [tense music continues] [tense music continues] - I love you more than I've ever loved anything. - How much is that? - I believe we've already met. - I used to be you puppet. - When I yell, start running zigzag. Now! Lupita! [suspenseful music] [Badal groans] [gun fires] [helicopter whirring] [guns firing] - Ow, shit! - Come on. [guns firing] [seagulls squawking] [guns firing] [suspenseful music continues] [van door slams] [car engine roars] [grenade snaps] [guns firing] [rifle snaps] [guns firing] [explosion thunders] - Got him! - God no! God! [sobbing] [crying] I don't wanna die! No, no, I don't wanna die! - Thank you, Chucho. I owe you my life. [Lupita sobs] - What do we do now? - We start over. Figure out a new plan. - How? We got nothing. - Let's try to take him now. We got nothing to lose. We've got guns, and they have a harder time to get things back in order. - He's right. - We got a plan with nothing? - With our balls. - Yeah, with our balls. - What do we got to lose? It just might work. Let's go, come on. [suspenseful music] [van engine roars] [dog barking] - [Guard 1] Hey, what's that truck doing over there? - [Guard 2] Get outta here. - [Guard 1] You can't stay here. - [Guard 2] What's going on? [dog barking] Get outta here. Get outta here. [explosion thunders] [guns firing] [dog barking] [explosion thunders] [guns firing] - Stop! [guns firing] [suspenseful music continues] - Don Thomas! You're under arrest. I'm taking you back to the United States, where you'll stand trail before the American Court of Justice. [suspenseful music continues] [handcuffs snap] - Move. [gun fires] - [Lupita] No! [somber music] [body thuds] - This is our justice. [somber music continues] [downbeat jazz music] [Lupita sobbing]
