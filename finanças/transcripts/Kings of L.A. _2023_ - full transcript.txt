And third, you don't owe me nothing, my nigga. SNOOKS: Yeah, bro? SATIN: For now. [SNOOKS SCOFFING] But we'll figure all that shit out later, my nigga. But... in the meantime, my nigga, you think you could, uh... pull a $20 or something out your pocket for a deluxe car wash? 'Cause you got my shit smelling peanut butter, assholes, and all the other county jail flavors, my nigga. You can't talk with your breathe smelling like that. But anyway, start this motherfucker up. Get me away from this systemic oppressionary peckerwood persecution bullshit. Persecution? Nigga, you the one who got caught driving under the influence. Nigga, I had two beers, bro, and some Flintstone vitamins I took with my daughter to build my amino acids up to be strong in these streets, my nigga. The shit must have, like, triggered a chemical imbalance or something. [SNOOKS SCOFFING] Anyway, I'ma get a DA reject. They looking for real criminals like your ass, nigga. You need to take my case and build your little rap career up. A'ight, look, going to jail ain't gangster at all, my nigga. And it definitely ain't finna to build shit, you know what I'm saying? But... nonetheless, I got your back, my nigga, on gangsters. I appreciate that, my nigga. Now start this bitch up, my nigga. I need some vaginal hugs, my nigga. [SATIN SCOFFING] Vaginal hugs. Nigga.

[SNOOKS SIGHING] Boy, some shit don't change. SNOOKS: Mama, that's nasty. Why you talking about my stuff like you've seen my thang before I saw it pre-puberty and let's just say that's one thing your daddy didn't gift you with. Maybe that's why you messing with them old Mexican girls now. Your taquito ain't built for a sister. [SNOOKS SCOFFING] Here you go. Mama, I love my sisters, but I'm just on drama overload right now. Because between you and my baby mama, y'all bring enough grief to the table for like two weekends worth of funerals. Like, Goddamn, can I breathe? Listen Donald, I've been trying to tell you this for a long time now. You need to stand on your own two feet. Because your mama ain't gonna be around much longer to clean up your shit. Mama, ain't nothing finna to happen to you. Quit playing. I'm serious, boy. Now, I'm finna to go to work. Okay? You need to straighten up, get yourself a stable job and follow suit. [BOWL AND SPOON CLINKING] You can't seem to keep a job or a woman. Mama, I got a job. I'm just on suspension right now Plus I'ma ask Ernie T. if I could process serve for him on my beach cruiser. If not, I'ma just get into the entrepreneur thing. You know, I - I got... I got big things popping, mama. I got apps developing. You know, niggas love tech shit. So, why don't you develop a help a nigga grow the fuck up app? Whatever, ma. They probably already got a app for that anyway. Then use it! Then use that Trade Tech degree you got hanging up in the wall in there. [YOLIE SIGHING] You got way too much untapped potential, son. I didn't raise no poop butts. And your granny, she didn't come all the way from Mobile, Alabama for you to just take up space in South Central. We got enough of that with our young Black men out here. [HEAVY HEARTBEAT] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HAND DRUMS] [DOOR KNOCKING] [MUSIC ENDS] [YOLIE SIGHING] Mama, I'ma - I'ma get the door, mama. 'Scuse me. [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS] [FLOOR CREAKING] [DOOR CREAKING OPEN] What's up with it big homie, Bosco! [HANDS SLAPPING] What it is, young pimp? [UPBEAT FUNKY MUSIC] SNOOKS (VO): Bosco, yeah that's my OG. He a ex-military vet. He 'bout a decade older than me, but he was that nigga that young niggas like me looked up to in the hood. He was like the Michael Jordan of my generation. ♪ Show me love ♪ Crazy as fuck. Led the hood in assaults, batteries, robberies, and just about every other criminal stat known to make a con. [FUNKY UPBEAT MUSIC] Word is, he used to carry a briefcase to high school, [BRIEFCASE THUDS] with a clawed hammer inside of it, ready to use it on any nigga that gave him or any homie he loved problems. [HAMMER THUDDING] [FUNKY UPBEAT MUSIC] It's ironic that he eventually became a carpenter slash handyman. He is as compassionate as they come. But he still has some demons that he's still dealing with, and it's said that it stems from a fucked up incident during his childhood or his time in the Persian Gulf War. Either way, I got big love for him. [MUSIC FADES] SNOOKS: Some money? Get that $50 to your mama and tell her I said thank you. Oh man, you know it ain't no thang, bro. We gotta stick together. Around here, it ain't too many of us left in this neighborhood, man. The Mexicans done ran us up outta here. Nah, we ran ourselves up outta here, young blood. Ever since after the riots, we started giving our shit away. Always remember, the strong survive. But that was real shit, bro. Real shit though. But, uh, what's up with you, though, bro? BOSCO: Shit, nut. Nigga had to fuck around and get his wisdom tooth pulled with the quickness and then the county dropped me from my Medicare. And check this shit out. Said 'cause I didn't show up to my recertification appointment. Bullshit. Hey, 'cause the night before, [BOSCO CHUCKLING] I fucked around and got twisted with Sheila Moe. Oh! Ooh!

Damn, bro! They got yo ass. [CAR DOOR CLOSING] Oh my God! This bitch, bro. Really gonna need this motherfucker after this. [CAR DOOR CLOSING] Here, nigga. Since you can't seem to pay me no child support, the least you could do is spend some more time with your daughter. Tasha, what, you can't be just popping up at my mama house on this ghetto shit. It's not cool. And you can't just be ducking your responsibility. There ain't nobody ducking nothing. I stay with my daughter all the time. Well, all the time ain't enough. And you better not have her around that Mexican hoe, I promise you. Oh my God! Daddy, what's a hoe? [SNOOKS SCOFFING] Ask your mama, baby. I'm sure she can show you a good example of one. And I ain't feeling that gangsta ass nigga Mike-Mike around my daughter either. Baby, go in the house and watch some cartoons, daddy will be in there in a minute. [SOFT FOOTSTEPS] Tasha, look we don't gotta fuck with each other. I don't gotta like you, you don't gotta like me, but we gotta respect each other. All this poppin' up at my mama house unannounced shit, this some ratchet ghetto shit. I can't fuck with this shit, for real. TASHA: Ratchet? Nigga, fuck you, okay. Fuck you and that little ass-dick. Fuck yo mama. How 'bout you fuck your mama with that little ass-dick, TASHA: broke-ass nigga. SNOOKS: You see... ... this bitch is just ratchet. YOLIE: What you say you, you heifer? What you say? SNOOKS: Mama! TASHA: Bye, mama. SNOOKS: Mama. SNOOKS: Yo, Oh, God. YOLIE: Put me down. Put me down! This is shit all... Mama, your granddaughter looking You can't just be out here chippin' with her. This is what I'll be talking about. Damn! Put some clothes on, knucklehead Oh my God! [CAR ENGINE RUNNING] [SOFT UPBEAT MUSIC] So, how's that golf stroke doing, Mayor Taylor? 'Bout as good as that pen stroke of yours is doing. I guess you forgot how much I used to whoop you up and down that golf course, my friend. I think your memory fails you, buddy. Now ,how are you supposed to run a city with so much potential like South Central when you can't even remember the last beating you took. The last beating I took was from my mother in the fifth grade when I came home after the street lights came on. Best believe that's the last hell I ever took. BARNETT: Yeah, well, let's hope that mythological winning streak of yours is unwavering for your upcoming reelection campaign. Hey, you just make sure you have that doggone check ready. Hey, what's wrong with you? Why you keep, uh, rubbing at your chest like that? Oh, I, uh, I fucked up and left my body wash at home. Had to use that damn cheap-ass hotel soap. And normally I wouldn't wash my dog with that brick shit, but I couldn't show up to a meeting with a big time mayor such as yourself smelling like MAYOR TAYLOR: Oh, whatever. the uh lost and found box at the Y, right? [CAMERA CLICKING] [ARTIE HUFFING] Damn. [LOUD GUM CHEWING] [CAMERA CLICKING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] What the fuck do you think they're over there talking about I don't know. You know, politicians are just professional fertilizer spreader Some people spread more shit on their lawn than others. The fuck do we care? [DISTANT TRAFFIC] True, true. The man wants us to observe and report, so I'm gonna sit here and observe and report for a few extra duckets. Shit, God knows I need 'em. You know, our priority is to chase dope and guns, not some entitled elitist asshole who likes waving his dick around like a 10 inch dick on a porn set. But like porn, [ARTIE HUFFING] this pays very well, it just doesn't include any high level of dignity once the job is done. [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] But we go on and get that money shot, dawg. You know, you have a very dirty way of expressing yourself. And a very dirty habit. Those things are gonna kill me, if they don't kill you first. Oh, well, hopefully they will before some South Central gang member does. [MASON CHUCKLING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] [CIGARETTE BURNING] I guess you got a point there. [ARTIE HUFFING] There's more honor in dying from tobacco fire than gun fire. You've enlightened me. Let's get the fuck out of here. [TRAFFIC BUSTLING] Bust some heads. [TRAFFIC BUSTLING] [UPBEAT DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] BARNETT: You're sure the council will approve this? You got the money. I got the land. Three out of five of the city council seats are my people and majority vote rules, which means your property development is in good hands. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Well, when we break ground, we break bread, brother. Let's just be ready to cut that check, colonizer. I travel with cash, my friend. Okay. Oh, hey, what's the status on that dispensary? Yo, word from PD is they've had trouble maintaining the added paperwork to stay in business, so doesn't look like they're gonna be around much longer. There's also rumors of possible illegal activity running through that place. So, if I were you, I'd be prepared to take possession of that property as well. All right. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hello, pussy. [GRUNTING NOISES] What do you call a man who kills and steals from his own people? [DIRTY DONNIE GRUNTING] Normally, I'd call him an ambulance, but in your case, I call him a traitor. [LIGHTER CLICKING] [DIRTY DONNIE GRUNTING] DIRTY DONNIE: Ooh! Your Black ass ain't worth the ride to the hospital. [DIRTY DONNIE GRUNTING] Yo punk-ass has committed the most egregious and heinous act a motherfucker could possibly pull off. Mm-hmm. You hear me, motherfucker?

Mm-hmm. We can arrange that for you. Oh, but you know what, that's a parole violation and you are a repeat offender. You know what? I bet you wouldn't live past booking once your jacket hit the wire. Oh, yeah. Even the guards at Wasco would turn a blind eye to a medieval molly-whopping on a serial child molester. Oh, yeah. [SUNDOWN CHUCKLING] Hey, yo, Pipe!

Usually, I don't trust no niggas as far as I can throw 'em. Especially no street nigga. Or white niggas who listen to hip hop. But this particular nigga, he's delivered in the past. So, let's just say, he on nigga trans-probation. In that case, I'll have one hand on my dick and the other on my gun. MASON: Yeah, you do it.

[MAYOR TAYLOR SIGHING] Uh-uh. Remember who you are, not who people want you to be. Yeah? Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I feel like I can sleep better at night. The question is, can you? Brandy, you knew what you signed up for. Funny, women w- you - you want a brother in the - in the limelight. When shit gets too bright, you wanna step in there and you wanna block his shine. [BRANDY SCOFFING] MAYOR TAYLOR: Yes, I have to divide my time between my constituents, my job, and you. So, what do you want? Y - You want 50% of a good man or you want a 100% of a bad one?

I'm about to take this computer from the Flintstones to the Jetsons. It got, like, sleep apnea. You know the late night infomercials? [SNOOKS CHUCKLING] They ain't got no cure for this old-ass piece of shi... I mean, um, I got the cure right here, mama. YOLIE: Mm-hmm. Uh, when you gonna turn them skills into a paying gig? [SNOOKS SIGHING] Mama, I'm trying. But Silicon Beach ain't hiring no niggas. It's like, the white man, he just gonna hire another pink motherfucker, so they don't jeopardize the white power structure. Ain't no niggas got no tech companies around here. I'm reading all these brochures talking about technology is the present and the future. They don't got no niggas in the plan. It's also a time and era for an entrepreneur to thrive in this society. Let that sink in. Either way, I hope something pop off for you real soon. Me too mama, 'cause Jackie pregnant. Goddammit, Donald! Don't you know how to use a condom? They come in like 13 different brands and different flavors and colors and shit. And don't you know them Mexican girls get pregnant if you look at them for more than five minutes. Mama, you think you gotta tell me that, mama? I know. Every time I try to make a positive move in the right direction, it seem like something just jump in my way. Yeah. Well this time, your peter jumped in the way. Again. Is she keeping it? Hell, what you think, ma? When's the last time you seen a Mexican in a Planned Parenthood ad? That's why there's so many of 'em. Well, I guess I probably should tell you that I'm selling this house. And I'm moving out to Phoenix. I got a good job opportunity out there and I need a change of scenery. This place is not good for Black folks no more, as I'm sure you already know. Mama, what am I supposed to do now, mama? You're supposed to man up. [SNOOKS SIGHING] [TRAFFIC BUSTLING] Look, Mr. Samir, I can't afford to pay you three times the amount of the rent that I'm already currently paying you. Look, I'm sorry. The decision has been made. You have three months to find a new place to sell you sweet potato pies, which by the way, are the bomb, no pun intended. And by the way, I'll take a slice with some coffee. I've been in this same location since '94. I fixed your air conditioner, I fixed all the leaks in the roof, I replaced the floor. How could you do this to me? [FUNKY DRAMATIC MUSIC] And how the hell am I supposed to find a new location to move my business and bring all my customers with me? What customers? Do I look like Stevie Wonder? Because I don't see no ribbon in the sky. This ain't right and you know it's not right. [PIPER WHISTLING] These customers. Hey, uh, Black Panthers, she'll be with you in just a minute, huh? Yeah, well, he'll be with you right now. Yeah. Take a seat, Sami. That is what Virginia Slim calls you, right? Hey, who is this Virginia Slim you speak of? I quit smoking in the '70s. [FUNKY DRAMATIC MUSIC] Sit your Figueroa prostitute patronizing ass down. And what is this guy talking about? I don't love these hoes. Sit yo' ass down before I slap the taste of slurpee juice out your mouth. [DRAMATIC FUNKY MUSIC] [SUNDOWN GRUNTING] Check this out, homie. We know why you're raising Brenda's rent. You're trying to sell this property to that group of Caucasian developers who's sole intent is to gentrify this highly coveted area. We're here to stop the bleeding from you blood suckers. This place is for sale and I can't stop it. [BULLET THUDDING] SUNDOWN: You will stop it. [FUNKY MUSIC CONTINUES] We got receipts on you. Slim keeps great records. Oh, yeah, remember it's the tech age. Click. [SUNDOWN LAUGHING] I'm sure that pretty little wife of yours that's half your age won't take too kind to find out about your patronizing to them Figueroa slut bags from Virginia Slim. Who is this Virginia Slim? I thought I was donating to the Sally Struthers Children's of African Nations. Knock it off. Here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna renew Brenda's lease for two years and at the end of the lease, she's gonna have the option to purchase this place from you at fair market value. Now, taking Brenda's check to the bank is a lot cheaper than that white bitch taking your dumb ass to the cleaners. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [PAPER RUSTLING] You dig what I'm saying? [MUSIC CONTINUES] I dig. Good. So, what's this for? That's a reminder. What happens if you happen to renege on this deal. Thank you. Hey, no problem. Hey, do you have any of those slamming sweet potato pies to go? [BRENDA CHUCKLING] Of course I do. Can I have a slice? [SOFT FUNKY MUSIC] [DOOR OPENING] PIPER: All in the day's work, right Sun-dizzy? [SUNDOWN CHUCKLING] Yeah, but our work ain't done yet, bruh. Oh, yeah. Wha... Wait, what else we got to do? Hey, man, we got to tend to these sweet potato pies. Right. [PIPER LAUGHING] Nigga, I was like, I don't see no more ghetto superhero work on my cards for today. Oh. True, true, but righting 400 plus years of wrong is a tireless job, my brother. Yeah, I feel you. [SUNDOWN CHUCKLING] Yeah, you know what, shoot, I'mma need a nap after grabbing on these joints. Hey, even us black superheroes need to rest, [TRAFFIC BUSTLING] Especially us nigga ones. [SUNDOWN CHUCKLING] [GUN FIRING] SUNDOWN: The fuck! [GUN FIRING] [GUN FIRING] [TIRES SCREECHING] SUNDOWN: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not here, not here. Not now. Weren't you hit, big homie? No, I'm good. But, who the fuck was that? Seemed like some old random shit. Nah. Ain't nothing random around here. It wasn't no niggas, though. Shit, how you know that? No, I seen a little piece of his skin. Could be the Mexicans starting up on them niggas again. Yeah. Could be. Could be not. Mm-hmm.

[MELANCHOLY MUSIC] [DOOR OPENING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] SNOOKS: Ernie T. ERNIE T.: Gots to be more careful. [ERNIE T. SIGHING] Snooks, or should I say, inmate 777-93-11. [ERNIE T. CHUCKLING] You know what, I done told Esther about leaving that damn front door open. You know what? She gonna mess around and let one of these janky ass street negroes come up here and jack Ernie T. for his duckets. When she knows they saw me go to that versatell machine this afternoon. Ernie T, I'll tell you what, you always about your money, man. You damn right, boy. 'Cause let me tell you something, a man is only as valuable as his currency. If you only got $2 in your pocket, you just a $2 nigga. But I digress. [ERNIE T. SIGHING] Why you here, boy? Did you get that check I sent you in the mail young blood? I did get the check, and you shorted me on some overtime too. That wasn't cool, Ernie. Oh, man Donald. Now you know Ernie T. don't pay no overtime less you call the labor board on a nigga. It's cool, Ernie. So, we gonna make a lot more money. I'm here to get my job back. Uh, yeah, but I can't hire no convicts. You know, my insurance won't let me hire legal process servers with a criminal record. Ernie, I'm innocent. I got a DA reject. You mean the court system's backed up and they ain't got time to deal with yo monkey ass. I mean, you got over. Go play the lotto, negro. You're blessed. Nah, Ernie, I'm serious. I just left the DMV. I'm good over there too. I'm ready to get my job back. Look... the truth is, young blood, I had to hire somebody to take over your workload. I got two new clients, there was so much business I had to turn down money, and you know how Ernie T. don't like to miss no dollars. Ernie, you gave my job away? To a Mexican fella. He came in here and he works for 50% less money and a 100% less attitude. Come on Ernie, man, you know I need this job, man. Okay, okay. Okay look, I'll hire you back, all right. But you gonna have to take the same pay Javier takes, all right, which is 50% of your previous rate. That's the best I can do. My overhead done went up since the last time I was here, man. ERNIE T.: Look man, let me know. [SNOOKS SIGHING] Until then, I got to get on out of here. I gotta go meet Chuck over off of Dinka, man. I gotta get some of that Viagra, you know? My old lady, she got a promotion and later tonight, she gonna get a little taste of this party favor. You know what I mean? Ernie, I don't gotta think about it, man. I really need this job, man. ERNIE T.: Okay. Well, cool. Square bills then, bro. You know what? I got something for you. [PAPER RUSTLING] This just came in tonight. You gotta serve that reefer store over there on Century. The city is really after 'em, all right? It's a high priority, no pun intended. Listen, go down there and play the role. You know what I mean? Be a superstar. Act like you gonna buy something when you go in there. And when you buy something, really buy something. And bring me a nickel bag of ooh wee, all right? Ernie, with the salary you paying me, I ain't gonna be able to afford nothing besides the nickel bag of stress weed. Now see, that's the attitude that got your ass written up the last time. You know what I'm saying? Ah, ah... I'm just fucking with you, Ernie T. Mm-hmm. Dry ass sense of humor, man. Don't let that distract you from the fact that I'm actually grateful for the opportunity. All right, great, 'cause I'm distracted right now, because you making me miss my trim. You're cock blocking. You hear me? Gotta go. Make sure you lock up, okay? SNOOKS: I'll lock up. God damn shit, boy. I'm trying to get some ass and here you come with your bullshit "I need a job." Nigga, that shit became the neediest motherfucker. How you gonna hire the Mexicans? ERNIE T.: Oh, shit. SNOOOKS: The Mexicans are taking over. ERNIE T.: They work and they bring oranges. [DOOR OPENING] MASON: That's it. ARTIE: Right.

Y'all gonna make a concerto up in here on a brother? Man, Take Two Video is working my nerves. It sound like two fleas fucking in the back of a funeral home. If you ask me, I think Blakk back there aimlessly pushing buttons high. Hey, is he counting that money, though? [MUSIC CONTINUES] Probably not.

Now the word is, that you guys have been selling more than the legal maximum amount of grams to any individual who offers up the right amount of cash. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [DEE CHUCKLING] Man, you know that's some bullshit. No, nigga. That's some motherfucking real shit. Y'all still don't believe that fat meat is greasy? [DEE CHUCKLING] Well y'all know we've been on the straight and narrow. We know the city didn't want us here from the beginning. Well, we gotta see how straight you guys are. [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] MASON: Come on. Let's go see all that paperwork. [DEE CHUCKLING] DEE: Y'all on some bullshit. I see what this is. Shall we take this to the back? Y'all wanna unlock that door for us now? I really don't. Please do. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [BLAKK SIGHING] [DOOR BUZZING] [DOOR OPENING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Shazam! [MASON CHUCKLING] I think we found their paperwork, partner. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] MASON: Mm, mm, mm. Now, we just gonna, you know, act like we don't see these white packages filled with non-FDA approved substances. If y'all make sure we see green this time around, dig? Now, pay attention. I'll quarterback this for you, 'cause you look a little like you deficient. Now, just what we see open in plain sight, you're looking at a long vacation in a federal penitentiary resort Mm-hmm. MASON: Oh, yeah. This is definitely some Scarface type of shit going on up in here. Now listen, we're talking municipal violations of patient purchase limit violations, failure to report inventory, state and federal crimes of possession with intent to sell, what looks like crystal meth to me and I haven't even gotten started on the RICO acts your organization has committed. Now, just imagine how they're gonna feel when this operation shut down and you just might start singing like the Temptations. [MASON SINGING] ♪ I ain't too proud to beg ♪ ♪ And you know ♪ Nigga, listen. What the nigga is saying to you is y'all motherfuckers need to liquify these palms. And I ain't talking about with Jergens, jerk-off. [SOFT UPBEAT MUSIC] ARTIE: What's going on here? MASON: What the fuck is going on here? Y'all got some damn cats? It smell like peepee in here. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GUN FIRING] MASON: Oh! Shit! [GUN FIRING] MASON: Oh, fuck! Oh! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GUN FIRING] [SECURITY GUARD GRUNTING] SNOOKS: Nigga, what the fuck! [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] Y'all niggas just shot the police! SATIN: Nigga, I'm starting to like this shit. BOSCO: What about these two niggas? SATIN: Fuck 'em. [GUNS FIRING] [GUNS FIRING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] SNOOKS: Yo, why the fuck did you do that? SATIN: Nigga, we got three dead law enforcement right here, nigga. Fuck you think they was gonna say? They just fell out the sky? Nigga, the less witnesses the better, bro. BOSCO: Nah, he right, baby bro. SATIN: Yeah. Yeah, I know I'm right, nigga. SONNOKS: The fuck you doing, bro?

SATIN: All right, nigga, let's get this shit and get up outta here, nigga. But before we go, I gotta let you know something, bro. [SNOOKS SCOFFING] SNOOKS: Nigga, that shit could wait, nigga. What the fuck? Yeah, it could wait, but I'mma let you know right now. You know that baby that's in your girl's stomach? Yeah, that's mine, nigga. SNOOKS: What the fuck is you talking about? SATIN: Do the math, nigga. You was on hiatus from the pussy for two weeks, nigga, before you went to jail. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] How you think I know about that? Huh? She told me y'all was on break. She thought you was still fucking Tasha. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] And that night after you got knocked, she called me after you called her. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Now you know why I took so long for your bond to go through. I was cashing in on that coochie first. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] She fucked me for your bail money, home boy. A pretty admirable thing to do, but kind of whorish at the same I told you, you can't trust these hoes as far as you could throw 'em. Let's just get this shit and get up outta here. We got a baby to raise, my nigga. I woulda merked you, my nigga, [SNOOKS BREATHING HEAVILY] but, uh, somebody gotta change them shitty ass diapers. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SNOOKS BREATHING HEAVILY] Nigga, fuck you, nigga. Nigga, fuck me, nigga? That's how you talk to the father of your child, nigga? [SNOOKS BREATHING HEAVILY] Man, nigga, you couldn't bust your gun on these motherfuckers, just like your daddy couldn't in that massage parlor robbery in '92. Did you think I don't know the foul? You can't even bust a nut in your bitch right. I'm 'posed to think you finna kill me? Nigga, stop playing. Put the gun down, nigga. You ain't no killer, nigga. Let's go. [GUN FIRING] [SNOOKS GASPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MASON BREATHING HEAVILY] That was a foul little nigga. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SNOOKS CRYING] [GUN THUDDING] [SNOOKS GASPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Go on, little fool. [SNOOK WHIMPERING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CAR ENGINE RUNNING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [CAR DOOR OPENING] [CAR DOOR CLOSING] [BARNETT CHUCKLING] BARNETT: Mayor Taylor. What an ingenious idea to meet outside the city limits of South Central. Big Brother can't see this far, right? MAYOR TAYLOR: Yeah. We don't need anybody seeing us together after hours. I attract attention when I move, especially when I'm with... [MAYOR TAYLOR SCOFFS] special interests. Yeah, well, my melanin filled friend, I don't think anyone's gonna be able to see you tonight. Me on the other hand... MAYOR TAYLOR: How about we cut to the fucking chase finalize this shit. Listening to your colonizer humor isn't part of the deal. Well, I hope selling out your people still is. You have the city council vote, three to two, in your favor. That's assured. It better be. Do I need to remind you of the repercussions should you not fulfill your end of things? Excuse me? BARNETT: Fuck it. You know what? Let me go ahead and do something. I have key people in high places. They will jump into action on command, and you won't know who or where they'd be coming from. Cash, [BARNETT CHUCKLING] moves people to do very dastardly things. You know this. Hmm? [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] You fucking threatening me? No. I'm just essentially reading you the unwritten penalty clause of our agreement. If you should breach this agreement, a new agreement will be executed. All right, Barnett. We do it your way. Fuck you. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] And fuck that money. [GUN FIRING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [BARNETT GRUNTING] [BARNETT THUDDING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] This South Central all mine. [MAYOR TAYLOR BREATHING HEAVILY] I'm it's mayor. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [ENVELOPE RUSTLING] [MAYOR TAYLOR BREATHING HEAVILY] [SNOOKS BREATHING HEAVILY] [CAR ENGINE RUNNING] JACKIE: Hey, Donald! SNOOKS: Oh shit! [CAR ENGINE RUNNING] JACKIE: Hurry up! SNOOKS: Oh shit! Get in the car! You scared the fuck out of me! JACKIE: Hurry up! SNOOKS: Whose car is this? It's one of my brother's. Go! [CAR DOOR CLOSING] SNOOKS: Oh fuck! Did you pack the truck? JACKIE: Of course I did. Could you not talk shit. Oh shit! JACKIE: What happened? SNOOKS: Fuck! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] What the fuck is going on? SNOOKS: Oh shit! Man, just fucking drive. I'mma tell you on the fucking road. Just go. Don't stop for shit. We got a long fucking time to talk about this shit. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HAND BANGING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GATE OPENING] Oh, look who showed up and showed out. See, I knew you still had a little nigga left in you, Randall. Real men do what they have to. I never lost sight of who I am. Let me up in this bitch before somebody sees me out here. Hey, well, come on in, Mayor. [GATE CLOSING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HANDS CLAP] Clearly, you know it's done. Of course I do. Piper is dismantling and disposing the body as we speak. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] How do I know none of this is gonna get out? SUNDOWN: Look, when you gonna come down out of that cloud you in and realize I have just as much to lose as you do, Mayor? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] You know what, you look like you need some coffee or something. You know, I got some of that freshly imported shit from Columbia. You know, let me be a hospitable boy and go get you a cup. You know, how about a Cuban, huh, to boot? Ease them nerves? Huh? Fuentes, my brother? MAYOR TAYLOR: Fuck you. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Last thing I need is a fucking cup of coffee right now, Ron. SUNDOWN: You know what? You're shaky enough without it. Which is understandable since this is your first body and all. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] My last one. Where the master files at? They're safely stored away somewhere. I thought we were square. Come on, that's leverage, nigga. You know how you politicians be flipping and flopping and shit. But don't worry. You know, they're good as long as you're good. And I'm not gonna set you up for the fall like them Feds did. Very kind to you. What do you mean by good? SUNDOWN: Good and honorable to my people. Your priority is to honor and protect this city at all costs. Now as long as we understand that and SUNDOWN: you on the right path. [MAYOR TAYLOR SIGHING] Look man, those fouls will never see the light of day. [MAYOR TAYLOR SIGHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] A'ight. They better not. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MONEY THUDDING] MAYOR TAYLOR: Here you go. The money Barnett gave me in exchange for that vote. That ain't happening now. You know what, I'm glad you brought that up. So now it's three to two against, now, right? MAYOR TAYLOR: That's right. SUNDOWN: Hmm. My vote being the swing vote. [SUNDOWN CHUCKLING] Show you right. Show you right. Well, you can take that money. Don't nobody know where it came from. [MUSIC CONTINUES] I know where it came from. SUNDOWN: Hey, man, look man, you can put that money to some good use, you know. Possibly your reelection campaign. That money got blood on it. [SUNDOWN SCOFFING] SUNDOWN: Man, what money don't? Look, you better take that money, nigga, before I change my mind. And then after that, go home and get you some rest. We don't want you going to that city council meeting looking like a man who was up all night doing dirt. You know, like committing murder. Hey look and don't forget to tell your colleagues downtown that they don't have to worry about that dispensary over there on Century. Somebody took care of that for y'all. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I bet they did. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [ENVELOPE RUSTLING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GATE OPENING] [CAR ENGINE RUNNING] SNOOKS (VO): Boy, life just seem to get tougher by the day, especially in a city like South Central. I never thought things would evolve like this. [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] I could blame the city. I could blame my father. I could certainly blame the powers to be as well. But I will forever share some of the blame. While I figure all that shit out about how I got here, I still gotta figure out where I'm going from here as well. If Satin was telling the truth about my baby and how I gotta put this dirty money to good use and just about the future overall. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] One thing's for sure, I need to get the fuck out of South Central. [CAR ENGINE RUNNING] I might never return. It's hard to say. Then again, my pops is coming home in a few months. Ain't no telling what he gonna be on or need. I mean, he is South Central. And I'm a product of him and our city forever.
