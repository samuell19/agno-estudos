Woman If you can talk to God Ask Him if I ever Stopped adoring you And the sea Mirror of my heart The times it has seen me cry The treason of your love Here you go, Emilio. Your toast... -Napkin... -Hey. Oh, yes. You're right. We have a new chef and I didn't tell him. Mario, Emilio doesn't like the tomato on his bread! I'll never understand why you order bread and tomato if you don't spread the tomato on the bread. It's about enjoying pure flavors. I order bread and tomato because I like the flavor of bread and of tomato. But if I mix them, I don't enjoy it, not one nor the other. You really like to talk. I love to. -I can't believe it! -Believe what? I think it's the first time in years that I bring your breakfast before you've finished the sudoku. It's not called "sudoku," it's called "magic square." Wow, I didn't know that. The Japanese think they invented it, but all they did was put a name on something that already existed. Alright. No, you already paid, Emilio. Well... -I was testing you. -Sure. Is everything OK? What do you mean? I don't know, you seem different. I'm fine. You, on the other hand, always the same, pregnant again. I see I was wrong, that's my usual Emilio. You and your husband would do well to try some sudoku. -The magic square, you mean. -Right. I'm telling you, these numbers cannot be right! It's impossible to solve! Listen to me, I am a math teacher at a university. I know what I'm talking about. Can you put me through to the chief editor, please? Hello? Hello? Emilio, I'm going to ask you some very simple questions. You have nothing to worry about. -Understood? -Sorry, but... is there a reason why you're talking to me like I'm retarded? Alright. My name is Catalina. But you can call me Cati. Do you have a nickname, Emilio? I use my full name, thank you. Let's get started, then. What year are we in? It's 2017. What season? -Spring. -Great. -What city are we in? -Valencia. Great. Great. -And what place are we in? -Prison. I've been in here all day doing tests. -You won't let me leave. -Emilio. Please. I need you to take this seriously, OK? -Hospital. -Good, Emilio. Now, Emilio, I need you to imagine that you have 30 coins. Can you see them? Of those thirty, you give me three. How many are left? Forgive me, Cati, but... although I'm retired, I'm a math teacher. I know, your file says so. -University math. -It says that too, I read it. Fine. I have 30, I give you three, I have 27 left. Great. What if you give me three more? -24, 21, 18, 15, 12... -Great. -Nine, six, three, zero. -Yes, I see that you... Now, Emilio, can you tell me what this is? It's a fact! You think I'm an idiot. Because I couldn't finish a magic square? Is a man not allowed to have a bad day, or what? My head is perfectly fine. Do you see this part? It's the hippocampus. This is where your most recent memories are. They'll be the first ones lost. After this, it will go to the front section, which is the home of logical thought, and that will affect your problem-solving skills. The times it has seen me cry The treason of your love I look for you everywhere I go But can't find you Well, look somewhere else. Did you say something? If you sing, I can't concentrate. What's that? A magic square. A what? -It's a math riddle. -That sounds boring. I don't like math. I don't know what it's for. Math is for everything. Like that, for example. The proportions of that S are geometric shapes. It's not an S, it's an L. Doesn't look like one, right? I'll never finish it. I hate stitching. What I like is reading and writing. They're making us do this embroidery at school for our parents. It's a math symbol that means infinity. You can tell your father that you love him to infinity. Great idea! It will reach this rear part of the brain which is where your oldest memories are stored. Math is a language, too. Math is a language, too. It tells us things, like letters. Margarita, come for lunch! That's my mom. I have to go. I'm going to the beach. You can come with me, if you like. I can't. I have to study. I have to study. See you on Sunday. I'm Margarita, by the way. Do you understand everything I said? What is the solution? No... There's no solution. I would like to talk with a family member. -No. -No? I don't have any. No family? A nephew, a distant cousin? I have nobody. No. Hello, Dr. Rodríguez. How are you? Dad? Ah, did I forget to mention my daughter? It must have started... -Dad... -Hello. Excuse me. Dad? What are you doing here? Couldn't you have called me? -I would have liked to come with you. -I forgot. It's not funny. At all... See you! It's not funny because I work in this hospital and people know me. Excuse me. Thank you. What will people think of me if you tell them you have no family? You're a salesperson. You don't work in a hospital. -I'm a medical visitor. -That's the same. It's not the same, Dad. Excuse me. Doctor! Doctor! Wait. I have to talk to her. -Doctor! -I'll call you back. Sorry, Julia, I'm in a rush. No, just a second. Look, they're ideal. They fit perfectly in your coat pocket. -It has a pen included. -Thanks. I wanted to tell you... we have a fluorocycline that's the best on the market. OK, come up this afternoon and show me. Perfect. OK. Thanks! Goodbye. It is the same. -Want a lift? -No. -Let me take you. -It's not necessary. Will you come for lunch on Sunday? I'm going to tell you something that might change your life. Just two words: "I run." It will change your life. Because you don't know whether I'm referring to sport or "running" as in management. OK. Today I'm here to tell you just two words... Blanca, honey! Wash your hands and call your dad. Dad, come out! Coming! You spend all day in there. The rice is going to burn. Julia, who's cooking the rice? So I should know if it's burning, right? Are you uploading videos again, Felipe? My followers need me. Careful with this, it's really hot. Let's see... That's everything. Listen, honey... Blanca, darling, I don't like you using your phone at the table. What else? Bread. -And water. -Coming. Honey, don't make me regret buying it for you. Can you say something to your daughter, please? Blanca, honey. Blanca, your phone. Blanca... Blanca, what do we always say? You must live in the present. The here, the now. Come on, talk to your granddad. -Hey. -What? -I have Alzheimer's. -I know. Here, honey. Have some salad. No, not that. No, honey. Give me that. Give it here. No! You can't eat this. This has added sugar and saturated fats. You'll get pimples, darling. I can't eat at the table, either. Fuck, I can't do anything in this house. What you can't do is swear, honey. Alright? Can I have a little wine? No. There isn't any. Dad, I've spoken to the doctor and we've decided that it's best... for you to come and live with us for a while. You can stay in Blanca's room. -What? -No, no, no. No way. Take him to an old folk's home like everyone else. Please, honey... Shouldn't you and I talk about this? Darling... -My father needs us, OK? -That's not true. Dad, please. Why won't you let me help you? Because you're so annoying. I have enough on my plate with losing my mind. I don't need to put up with you, too. Great. Thanks. Emilio. There are university studies, very good studies, that say that incurable diseases don't exist. Are there? It's all up here. In our subconscious. We are the ones who don't want to be cured. Imagine that. If you believe in it with all of your force... The sum of all force is equal to zero. Take that. What are you doing? No... Didn't you quit? Let me smoke in peace, I'm begging you. Where's the lighter? Where is it? Give it here. Here. Give it. Mine. OK? That's it. Please, let me smoke in peace. I will, but first, please, answer this question: what is the purpose of smoking? -Because I need it. Give it. -I didn't say "why." I said "purpose." What purpose? "Why" only brings up your ego, excuses... "Purpose" shows our true motivations inside ourselves. -To relax. Give it here. -Perfect. Great. We're doing well. What's the purpose of relaxing? So that I don't have to argue with a man who is sick and is my father. The lighter! You're doing great! What's the purpose of not arguing with him? -Because that would be wrong... -No. Wrong. I didn't say "why." -"Purpose," remember. "Purpose." -I can't believe this. Think: what purpose? To... To... To be the good daughter that he won't let me be. That I want to be. -I want to be. -Perfect. -Please, give it to me. -We're nearly there. Stay with me. Stay here with me. Stay with me. What's the purpose of being a good daughter? What does your father do? To... -Coaching. -What? A profession he made up to not admit that he's unemployed. -I want to be. -Nearly there. What's the purpose of your father needing you? For him to feel proud of me, to... To feel like he cares about me even just a little. Please, let me smoke. -Great. Great, darling. -Please. -I'm very proud of you. -I'm proud of you too, but please, -let me smoke. -No, no. Just one more thing. Think about it. Will that cigarette really make your father love you more? I think it will. -No. It won't, darling. That won't happen. -Yes, yes. OK? Please. -What? -So what's the purpose of smoking it? Will this take much longer? I want to go home before I forget the way back. What purpose, he asks. I feel like it, and that's that. You found the wine. Well. I have reconsidered, Dad. Yes, you can stay in your own house. But with a cell phone. For what purpose? That's right, Emilio. For my peace of mind, Dad. I need you to have a phone so I can contact you at all times, that's all. You know I hate those things. I don't know how to use them. Well, don't worry. Blanca will show you. Why me? Honey, because you're the best. Nobody has more experience with phones than you do. -It's not fair. -Or healthy. Those things fry your brain. Yours is already fried, right? Eat. What's this? It's not the first time your mother has made me have one. How cute. Don't make a mess. How can you tell which is which? I don't see the titles. I know the order they are in. Yeah, sure... Which one is this? Don Giovanni. Mozart. Put it back in the same place. There. At least with this music you don't have to worry about forgetting the lyrics. Lucky me. Well, what about the classes? I have to show you something, right? You don't want to show me and I don't want to learn. You mother isn't here. She doesn't need to know. My mother knows everything. I'm surprised you don't know that when you're as smart as you are. Don't you have a TV? No. WiFi? Turn the sound off on that thing. I can't concentrate. What's that? A game. You have to add equal numbers up to 4,096. Let's see. Want to try? No. Sure? Well, if you insist... Granddad, you're the shit. I have to share this. My friends will go crazy. But you didn't do it. So? What else can you do with this thing, then? You mean "what can't you do." A cell phone is God. You can do everything. You can see the weather forecast. Old people love that, right? Well, you can spy on anyone you like, you can have sex... What? People at your age still do that, right? No. Not that, go back. Spy on anyone you like. Everyone is in here. Not everyone. I'm not there. Excuse me? Teacher at the University of Valencia. Discoverer of a prime number. You sent a letter to the editor of a newspaper complaining about a... What's a magic square? All of that is there? I told you, Granddad: God. What if you write "Margarita Piquer García"? Hey, who's that? -A friend. -What friend? What do you care? Who has the power? A childhood friend that I haven't seen in years and I'm curious about where she is now. Let's see. Margarita Piquer. Granddad, what a friend! That's not her! Margarita is my age. Get rid of that. Then it must be this one. Show me. This woman was born over 100 years ago. How old are you? Are there any more? Let's see... Yes, here's another Margarita Piquer. It's a list of literature teachers in Navarra. Literature teacher? Yes, in Navarra. Does it say where she lives? No, it doesn't. Ah, well. I thought everything was in there. Wow! Welcome to the 21st century, Emilio. That's cool! I like it a lot. Great. Now you can send photos, right? WhatsApps... Bye, Dad. Remember what I said: things can only hurt you if you open the door to them. You mean what happens to people that call me lame? Yes. No. No, darling. I didn't mean that. -Who calls you lame? -Nobody. It's a joke. -See you later. -Goodbye. -Give me a kiss. -Dad, everyone is looking. Hit it. -Goodbye! -Goodbye. Laura, Lucía! Bye, girls! Did you do the math homework? The problem with the oil seller was impossible, right? No way, it was easy peasy. Look. Wait, no. It's in the other one. My homework. Wait for me, please. Dad! Dad! Are you stupid? What's your problem? Insults... are fear, are rage. How are you today? Good. Shall we get started? 2018, autumn, Valencia, hospital. Emilio... You know that's not how it works. Well, I'm perfectly fine and I wanted to save us all some time. But I suppose you don't have anything interesting to do with yours. -Dad, please. -It's just... -Sorry. -Don't worry. Let's go straight to the coins. As you will remember, you have 30 coins. How many are left if you give me three? Dad? Give me a second. One second. There's no rush. -He's a math teacher, did he tell you? -Yes. At a university, too. Yes, he told me that, too. -Twenty-seven, Dad. -Twenty-seven. -Ma'am. -What? No, sorry. He's just a little... Sometimes he... Great, Emilio. And three more? -Twenty-four. -Twenty-four. -Please. -I'm sorry. It's just that my father can do this in his sleep. Show her, Dad. There's no rush, Emilio. Come on, Dad. 21, 18, 15... -12... -Good, great. See? He can do it. Hello. Yes, hello, I wanted to know if you can give me contact details for one of your secondary teachers. Can you tell me which school she worked in, at least? Confidential information? I understand, of course. Excuse me, but... is this the department of education of the Government of Navarra? Or the CIA? Hello? Hello? What are you doing here? I came to visit my Granddad. I'm sick, not stupid. OK. I don't want to go home and see my father. Yes, I completely empathize with that. Does your mother know you're here? Yes, I texted her and she said I could spend the afternoon with you. What? No. No way. I have to go somewhere. Aren't you too old to drive? Aren't you too young to be out on your own? Wait a second... Are you going to Navarra? You're going to look for Margarita, right? It's one of those bucket list things old people do before they die. -Let me go with you, please. -What? No, no. Go on, Granddad. Your mother would kill me. You're going to die anyway, right? Come on... Absolutely not. But, Granddad, how can you go to Navarra alone when you get lost in the bathroom? The way people have travelled for a long time. Look. With this, you don't need to remember where you're going. It does it all. Your will reach your destination in four hours and 21 minutes. You have chosen the shortest route. -What's your date of birth? -January 3rd. City? Are you going to start testing my mind as well? What test, Granddad? I'm making you a Facebook profile. For me? Why? To find Margarita, we need to find out where she lives. Do you want Facebook to activate your memories? Facebook knows that I have Alzheimer's? I'll say yes. It'll be good for you. Now, smile! Push your tongue against the back of your teeth. What is this? A photo or a Rembrandt portrait? Granddad, your profile photo is the most important photo a person takes in their whole life. Get it? -You don't want jowls. -Of course not. -Come on. -Fine. -That's it. -Good. Let's see. Take exit 1A to V-23 towards Sagunto using the right lane. Granddad, you have to look in the mirror! Yes, I did. What is that? Pornography? No. In my day, people who didn't wear clothes did so because they didn't have money to buy any. He's my boyfriend. I'm in love too, you know? His name is Pau. We met online. -He lives in Barcelona. -What? Wait. Do you mean you haven't met in person? No. -Well, yes. -What? Yes or no? -Well, yes but no... -I don't want to know. It's your mother. I'll answer because she won't give up. Wait. It's a video call. You have to hold the phone like this. -OK? -OK. Hello. -Dad. -What? Dad, where are you? At home. Where else would I be? OK, but you don't need to hold the phone so close, I can still see you. -I can't see you. -Alright. OK. Is Blanca there? She said she was spending the night. -Yes, she's here. -Can I speak to her? No... No, you can't... because she's in the bathroom. What are you doing, Dad? Nothing special. Continue on A-23 for 150 kilometers. Then, take exit... Dad, what's that noise? -The television. -What? No. You don't have a television. Dad, where are you? Careful! Blanca? Blanca, please, take the phone. Where are you? I don't know who you are. I don't know you. -You don't have children. -Let me talk to Blanca. -I don't have children! -Dad! Dad! Fuck, Granddad. Well, what do you expect? You taught me to do everything with the phone except to talk on it. Talk on the phone? What century are you in? You're going the wrong way. Redirecting the route. I think the obtuse one is the most flattering. LOL. What did you say? What does that mean? I'm laughing, it's funny... Like: "splitting your sides." Splitting your sides! Thank you. Bye. -Hello. -Hello. The prehistoric car. That's 30 euros. Granddad, come on. Come on, we have to pay. Is there a problem? -No. -Yes. Granddad, it's not funny. -Do you know this girl? -No. Emilio. It's me. Blanca. I don't know who she is. He has Alzheimer's. Let go. I think I should call the police. No! No, no. Really, we're fine. Right, Emilio? You're causing trouble, Granddad. You talk to him a second. Hello, how are you? No! Forget about this for a while. We're leaving. Well. Goodness, look at this. -Can you drive like that? -Yes. What's wrong with the car? Push the clutch harder. Like that. Dad, what gas did you use? There's more than one? Big trouble, Granddad. Big trouble. -No... -No way... Right. Great. Thanks a lot. See you soon. That's that. A tow truck is coming to take the care to a garage and tomorrow it'll be ready. Tomorrow? What do you mean, tomorrow? It can't be tomorrow, no... We can't sleep in this place. It's disgusting, it's tacky. No, please. We have to. But I'm not the one who crashed our car. Because if our car wasn't in for repairs, we would go home now and come back in the morning. That's why we have to stay, darling. I don't know which of the two of you is more to blame for this. -He's the adult. -Right. She's the healthy one. Hey! Don't you have anything to say to your daughter? Ah, no, yes. Of course. We're going to have a conversation... -When we get home. -Home? Do you think that this can wait until we get home? Anything could have happened to them! Where did you think you were going? Tell me, where? Where, Dad? To look for the love of my life. What? Dad... Were you going to Huesca? Dad, Mom isn't in the village. I know that your mother is dead. I wasn't talking about her. What? Huge trouble, Granddad. I... Hello. Look what I have for you. Don't tell your mother. A phone! A phone! Sixteen gigabytes? Seriously? I only sell out for 64 and up. Darling... No, listen... Blanca... Honey... So, this woman... -Margarita. -Margarita. -She's a childhood love... -That's right. And you've always been in love with her but you never told her. And you married my mother, who I've just discovered you didn't love. I did love your mother. -Right. -A lot. But I wasn't in love with her. And now, 50 years later, you want to go to Navarra to find this woman with the intention... of what, Dad? I mean, of... I don't know, getting married? Having children, a family? What? I just want to see her. If you were so in love with her, why didn't you tell her? I had to study a lot. There was no place in the equation for that. What? No, nothing... You don't discover a prime number without making sacrifices. Do you know why I studied science and not arts? Because we only spent time together when we were doing my math homework. -That's not true. -It is. We did chemistry together, too. Yes, well. What does it matter. -Never mind. -Wait. You're always complaining that I don't ask for your help. Well, I'm asking for it now. Please, my daughter... help me to find Margarita. Why now? Mom died five years ago. Why not then? Because I'm going to forget her. I've spent my whole life trying not to think about Margarita. And now that... I know what's going to happen, I don't want to. I'm sorry, Dad. I won't betray my mother's memory. Thanks. -What are you doing, honey? -Nothing. Nothing? What a luxury, to do nothing. Make the most of it while you're small, because then you grow up and you get obligations, responsibilities... It's very important to make the most of each stage of life. Not to go too fast, you know? -Are you a coach now too? -No. I just want you to know that you're still very young. You don't need to rush, there'll be time for... boyfriends. Or girlfriends, whatever you prefer. -No. -Yes, honey. I'm a very open mom, you know? You've been snooping in my phone? No, no, no. I would never do that, honey. You made a copy of the key to my diary when I was five. You were very small. How did you guess my code? How did I guess? You tap it in 20 times a day. It's my life! No it isn't. I'm your mother and your life is mine, OK? -It's not your life. -Mom, I hate you. You hate me? Great. Tell me something I don't know. Because, honestly... Something you don't know? Dad has a lover. He's cheating on you. We're not talking about me. This about you. -Did you hear what I just said? -We're talking about you. Where did you meet that boy? -You knew. -Online? Because if you met him online-- -Fuck, Mom! -Fuck, don't say "fuck." I don't like it when you swear! You knew. Well, yes, I did know. So what? What do you want me to do? What, should I get a divorce? Well, I won't. It's not fair. Because I work really hard to keep this family together. For us to be a happy family. I don't deserve to have it all go to hell because your dad can't keep his pants on. Alright? Because I haven't done anything wrong. Maybe that's your problem, you do everything too well. Dad, can you pass the jam? Of course. Well. I was thinking... since we're going to get home early, we could all go see a movie together. We haven't gone as a family in ages. I really like the idea, yes. We could watch a comedy, the ones Mom likes. Right, Mom? It's a great plan. Of course, darling. No, no. Dad, relax. Yes, Dad, give me the cup. Dad, give me the cup. Dad! Don't worry about it. -Darling, you went the wrong way. -No. Yes, you did. It was the other way. No, I didn't. We're going to Navarra. What do you mean, Navarra? We can't go to Navarra. -To Navarra. -We can't, I have work tomorrow. -I have two coaching sessions. -I'll pay for them. It's not about the money, Emilio. My clients need me. You mean they don't pay you. We can go, then. Yes. Emilio, you have a serious problem with passive aggression. You know that, right? You're aware. Wow, and I thought my problem was Alzheimer's. Where in Navarra? Well... Navarra. Navarra in general. Navarra in general? That's just great. Thank goodness my family doesn't need me. Forgive me, Mom, please. We're going to Navarra! Forgive me. Hello, Blanca. Are you OK? You haven't been online all day. Something super important has happened. My cousin's wedding is in Valencia. I'm coming to your city! Do you want to meet up? You know that I can't concentrate with that, Margarita. Dad, it's one thing to take you to find Margarita but it's another for you to rub her name in my face. -I think this is a real one. -What? -Dad, who is she? -Margarita. No, Dad. She's not Margarita, she's your granddaughter. What's your granddaughter's name? Dad? -Mom, it doesn't matter. -No, it does matter. We can't let him slip away from reality. It does matter. Come on, Dad. Think. What's her name? Come on. Let's see. Julia, she's right. Leave it. I will not leave it. Dad. Lame. What did you say? Granddad, no! Sock. No, Dad. No. White... White... blank... Blanca! Blanca. Blanca, great. That's right. Great, Dad. See? He can when he wants to. Blanca, great. We're going to get there and he won't remember what to say. 2018, autumn, the middle of nowhere. -Perfect. -Good, good. What's wrong? I'm embarrassed. -Come on, Dad. -Granddad. This is no time to be shy. We need to record this in case you forget it later. I don't know what to say. How about this? "My life before was like a dark night until you came along and... like a meteorite, you lit up my stars." No, no, no. That doesn't make sense because stars have their own light. They don't need other astronomical objects to shine. Right, Dad. Think. What did you like about Margarita? What makes her so special? What was it? She is... like the number pi. Record that. I like math so much because it's pure logic. Numbers are rational, predictable. But, suddenly, in the middle of this harmony, is the number pi. A number that's... mysterious, infinite. A number that's alive, it creates its own path without following established patterns. That's what makes math, as well as logic, partly magic, too. That's what Margarita was to me. Magic. Beautiful, Dad. She won't be able to resist. No... -Sure? -Yes. No, it was you! A cow dressed in uniform! -Are you calling me a cow? -What? My granddaughter is lame but not fat. Granddad, that's the second time you've called me lame today. No, no... Professor Pardo, don't you remember me? A cow dressed in uniform! The cow again... -Young man, are you drunk? -What? Here, honey, take this. Mom, this man is calling me fat. -What? -"Cow," to be precise. Excuse me? -Is that true? -No, no. This man was my professor at university and I was excited to say hello, that's all. Thanks to him, I discovered how fascinating math is. Well, in fact, that's my job now. I'm a teacher too. Right. Look, I'm sorry. It's just... There must have been a misunderstanding, but... -My father isn't well, you know? -I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it, because I'm sure you said it with great affection. I can tell. Math, fascinating? He's drunk for sure. Goodbye. This thing is vibrating. Let's see. Granddad! You've been accepted into the Navarra teachers group! -Ah, yes? -Look! Really? What? What is it? Is it her? -Yes. -Show us. Let's see. "Teachers from the Estella school at the anniversary of the center." So now we know where she worked. Right? We can ask there. -No. -Yes. -What? -I mean, we can go, but not today because it's Saturday and it'll be empty. Well, she's a 70-year-old woman living in a village. There's one place they'll know her for sure. Hello, good afternoon... Paqui. Look, I... we're looking for a lady who is about 70. I imagine she's a patient of yours. Her name is Margarita Piquer. We would like to know if you could tell us where she lives. That information is confidential. Right, but we've come from Valencia just for this. It's been a really long journey. Also, I... Well, I'm a colleague. -You're a nurse? -No. Doctor? Medical visitor. Salesperson. No. -It's not the same. -It is the same. -"Tss," what? -Clear the desk. There are people waiting. Listen, really, it's just... Look, do you see that man? He's my father. He's sick and he's dying. We don't have much time. So, please, we need that address urgently. Tell me something I haven't heard before. Honestly... Well, I didn't want it to come to this, but... All this is usually just for the doctors. But I'm going to make an exception for you, Paqui. What do you think? Where did you say you're from? -Valencia. -I can tell. Look, it doesn't fall out. Adorable, right? Look. It doesn't fall out. Oops! That fell out. What do you think? Next! Right. Thanks. Excuse me, ma'am. -What are you doing? -It's my turn. Don't make things worse. Paqui, excuse me, can I ask you something? Am I right in thinking that you used to be fun? Come off it! You were the type of person who wanted to do something useful, to do more, to make a difference... Right? That's why you studied nursing. To help other people. But people... People aren't always so grateful. We're not grateful to Paqui, to her colleagues, and the work they do. -You've lost your spark, Paqui. -Please... But you must wonder: what ever happened to that girl you once were? Concerned about others, wanting to help... You ask yourself, "Did that part of me die?" I don't think so, Paqui. She hasn't died. She's in there. She's right there. I can see her. And you know what, Paqui? This man... This man needs you. Yes. Give us the address, Paqui. Paqui! Paqui! -Come on, Paqui... -Paqui! Come on... Come on, Paqui... Come on, Paqui, you can do it. Come on, Paqui! Come on! Prove that you aren't the bitter civil servant we all think you are! Come on. No... Get out of here. Out! Now! I'll leave this as a gift. Thanks. I messed up. Let's go. What are you doing? When we get back to Valencia, I want you to move out. You could have tried to hide it at least, right? I don't understand how you could do this to me. I don't understand why you did it. It's not "why." Look, honestly... -No, it's-- -No. It's not "why." Ask me. -Fuck, this is ridiculous. -Alright, no. Relax, I'll ask myself. Felipe, what was the purpose of cheating? For you to catch me, Julia. For you to catch me and leave me already. -Granddad isn't in bed. -What? He's disappeared. Wait a minute. Dad? Dad! Dad! This can't be happening. Emilio! Dad! -Excuse me. I was told my father was here. -Yes. -Over there. -Dad. Dad. How are you? -Good. -Good? What happened? Did you get confused, lost? Do you know who I am? Yes, daughter, I'm perfectly fine. What were you doing out in the street in pajamas, in this cold? Fuck, what a fright. I don't think I want to see Margarita anymore. What? Enough is enough. -What is it? -No. No. No, no. So, because of this journey my marriage has broken down and my daughter hates me. You're right. We shouldn't have come. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dad. Dad, one thing... What was the purpose of seeing her? -I've already told you why. -No, not "why." What purpose. -You too? -Yes. Listen to me. What purpose? Well... To know whether she has been thinking of me all these years. Even just a little. Right. Well, we'd better find out, right? Let's go. -Thank you. -Come on. -Are you tired, Dad? -Yes, a little. Goodbye, Paqui. What? Margarita's address. Dad. Oh, Paqui... -Well... -Thanks, Paqui. I knew she wasn't the typical bitter civil... Get out of here. -Why would you say that? -Before I regret it. It was a compliment. Goodbye, thank you. I'm freezing. -Fuck! -Blanca, please. -I've told you that-- -Fuck! Really, come on now! Fuck! -You look incredible! -Thank you. -Where did you get that suit? -It's for special occasions. Dad, one thing. That's not the suit you wore when you married Mom, right? 2018, autumn, Navarra, Margarita's house. Margarita? That's not Margarita. Margarita isn't so old. Dad, some people don't age well. Excuse me, are you Margarita? No! Angustias. I told you so. It's just that... Sorry. We're looking for a woman called Margarita. We were told she lives here. Here? No. No? But I think that was the name of the woman who sold us the house. Wait. Abundio! Abundio! What? What was the name of the woman who sold us the house? What the fuck do I know! Yes. Her name was Margarita. But I don't remember her husband's name. Granddad, she's married. Well... I hadn't expected her to become a nun. Do you know where they moved to? They moved to a different house. What a relief to know that they didn't move to a boat or a spaceship. My cousin Antonia's son lost his job and went to live on a boat. So she can hear. Right, but... do you know where the new house is? Abundio! Abundio! Abundio! He's deaf as a post, it's exhausting. Hold on. Abundio! -What? -Never mind. Where do they live now? Who? The people who sold us the house. What the fuck do I know! Do you have a contact number for them? Do you have their phone number? -Whose? -It's just... -The people who sold us the house! -What the fuck do I know! -What did he say? -Nothing. Never mind. Thank you! No problem, dear. -Who was that? -What the fuck do I know! Some tequila to forget The woman who betrayed me I don't want to ever remember her I drink to drown my sorrows I'm leaving them in this... Yes, that's better. See you on Sunday. Emilio. My name is Margarita, by the way. Pass it to me. Take care. You too. Mozart. Mozart. Of course. This one? Granddad, let's use labels. Let's take Vivaldi and put it here. Let's take Mozart and put it here. -Let's take Bach... -Like tags on Facebook. Of course. Like tags on Facebook. Great, Granddad. A fraction is the number of parts of a whole that is divided... THIS TEACHER IS BORING... HI, BLANCA IT'S BEEN A WHILE I FOUND MARGARITA Great! I'M HUNGRY Is that a cell phone in my class? DO YOU HAVE HER ADDRESS? Blanca Molina Pardo! Out of my classroom, now. Why are you still awake, honey? What is it? Listen, Mom. What? I know where she lives. Where who lives? Margarita. How did you find out? Do you remember Pau, the boy on my phone? The one I told you could be a serial killer-- You're not focusing on the important part. What about Pau? Well Pau knows someone who knows someone who knows her. And? And he'll only give me the address if we meet in person. Are you telling me we have to go on another trip with your Granddad? -Because honestly I... -No. So? Pau is here in Valencia for his cousin's wedding. But that's marvelous news! Well... What? I haven't told him. Hey, come here. Listen. You know that... when you were born they told us you would never walk. You know that, right? But look at you. I have never seen anybody strut like you do, honey. What are you scared of, warrior? Warrior. I love you, Granny! I'm getting married! Applause for the bride! Let's go! The bride is on the dance floor! Come on, everyone! Hello. Hello. I'm Blanca. Blanca. I'm Tomás. You don't have to pretend to be someone else. If you don't like me, just say so. I don't get you. Blanca. Hello. I'm Pau. Great, I'm Blanca. He's my cousin. Pau? You went a bit overboard with the Instagram filters, didn't you? You haven't been completely honest either. What do you mean? Your... Your disability with reduced mobility. This is heating up! Everybody! Why did you insist so much that we meet in person? I was tired of pretending. And my cousin has a girlfriend and keeps uploading pictures with her. I was running out of material. Now what? The bride knows best! We can dance. No. Why not? Just because. I don't dance. Everybody move your hips! Dad, what are you doing? You're dancing. -I'm not dancing. -Dad, you're dancing. I don't dance. But, Dad... See this? -That's dancing. -This is dancing. Come on. It's the wrong music, Dad. Everyone, come on! Everybody! Allow me, gorgeous! Who wants the mike for some karaoke? Dad... A microphone! Woman If you can talk to God Ask Him if I ever Stopped adoring you Dad. Excuse me. Granddad! Margarita! Margarita lives in Valencia! I have the address! -Let's go! -In Valencia? Round of applause for the man with the bow tie! -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Here. Buy yourself a shirt. -Dad. -Yes, coming. Long live the newlyweds! Are you sure this is it? Yes. -Are you OK, Dad? -I'm fine. -Yes? -Yes, hello. -Hello. -Hello. Excuse me, my father is looking for the house he used to vacation in, and we think this is it. I wondered if we could see it. I'm sorry, but this has been my wife's family home forever. What now, Dad? -Excuse me. -Yes? Could I use the bathroom? My prostate is terrible. I know what you mean. Come in. Isn't this lovely? That ceiling. My wife and I renovated it, but we retained its original essence. -The bathroom is that door. -Thank you. You've been so friendly letting us in. -Go on, give him... -Let me give you... No, no, please. -Don't feel obliged, really. -This is beautiful. Margarita? It's me, Emilio. Emilio Pardo. The one with the magic squares. What time is it? I have to go to the shop before it closes. Who are you? And this, Lorenzo, looks like a simple sticky note... It's a magnet. That would be great for leaving notes for my wife. -It's yours. -Thanks. Since she fell ill, I use them a lot. Ill with what? Senile dementia. Advanced state. It's unusual for her to even recognize her own reflection. Dad. She's still an extraordinary woman, don't you think? I'm sorry, Dad. -What are you doing out here? -Nothing. I got lost, but we're leaving now. She never liked to sew. But lately it's all she does. It looks like an S. But it's an L. For Lorenzo? Yes. -Hello. -Hello. -Don't you prefer sudoku? -No. No, no. I don't like lentils. I don't like lentils. And you know it, Carmen. Dad. I'm not Mom. I'm your daughter. I don't have a daughter. Yes, you do. Mom. It doesn't matter. It does matter. -Look at me, Dad. -Mom. Dad, I'm Julia, your daughter. I don't have a daughter! And I don't like lentils! Alright. -Are you OK, dear? -Yes. It's alright, Dad. It's alright. Don't worry. No! No, Dad. Dad, relax. Dad. Like this? Let's see. -Are they tasty? -Very tasty. Yes? Here. Is there any wine? What is it, Dad? What? Dad, what's the matter? Relax, relax. Alright... Everything is fine, Dad. Look at me. Everything is fine. What year is it, Emilio? Dad. Come on. 2019. Julia. He's finding it a little harder. If you give him some more time, please. Julia... He's very good at the coins. Try him with the coins. You have to stop. Stop? I can't let him go. I can't. Is she crying? Why? It's nothing, Emilio. Don't worry. Right. You can use a nickname, if you like. The topic for today's class is that of integration by parts. A method of integration based on the derivative of a product of functions. -Dad. -Mom. Leave him. Professor Pardo. Yes, young lady. How do you calculate integration by parts? I'm glad you've asked me that question because it is, undoubtedly, a fascinating topic. Integration by parts... Integration by parts uses this formula. It seems difficult to remember, right? But it isn't if we use our imagination. One, Day, I, Saw, A, Cow Dressed, In, Uniform. The cow! Somebody told me once that math, like letters, is a language. So, let's speak it, ladies and gentlemen. One, two, three. Smile. There. Now a kiss for Granddad. Let's see. Last one, Dad. There. This angle gives me jowls. It doesn't matter, Granddad. We're going to go, Dad. Right. Come on, Granddad. Alright, Dad, I'll help you. That's it. Come on, up. Great. Who knows where you'll be Who knows what adventures you'll have How far you are from me I can't concentrate like this. Did you say something? What's that? It looks boring. A little. Do you want to come to the beach? My name is Margarita, by the way. I'm Emilio.
