My family. Normal family. Stop it! Now you'll be pestering us all Sunday! Heck! - Very smart! - What did I say? With a very cool father. Add hate, hate! A super cute mom, especially when her sister talks to her about dad. What are you waiting for? Why don't you get rid of this asshole?! This jerk is your father, you should respect him! But my dad is not just anyone! - Are you all right? - He's unemployed. - Fine. - But it's temporary. Did you find a workshop? But what I didn't know was that I'm not a child like the others. How can you tell if a child is a child prodigy? Quite often, our little geeks get bored. Isn't that right, Leblanc? Clean sheet - "count"! IQ - 140. When I tell this to your dad, he will go crazy! Monsieur has an IQ of 140! Yes, he's a cretin! 140 stupid things - yes! Dad is pissed off about mom's success. You are ready for anything for the sake of your ambitions! You have an incredible ego! He just doesn't like feeling worthless, useless. Nothing works! My life is not what I dreamed of. Everyone knows that my father is a genius. I have always said that Robert has golden hands. Everyone except himself. I have nothing to say. My daughter hates me! And so, on the day of my communion, it broke. Don't you understand that I feel bad?! And left without leaving an address. Robert! "WUNDERKIND". "Wunderkind" Part 2. CHARLOTTE DE TURKHEIM Yves RENIER Subtitle corrected by Branko Bron' joe mars! The Prodigy character was created by GILA BROUD. Screenplay and dialogues: PHILIPPE LOPEZ-CURVALL. You are a good boy! Thanks! Why are you standing like an idol? Can you hear me? - Hey! - Hey. Come on, help! - I'm not here for that. What difference does it make if you come? I didn't come to load sofas! Film ALEN BONNOT. - Did you take a shower? - There is no hot water, the column is broken. - Do as I do, wash yourself cold. - And I want hot! Oh-la-la, already wound up in the morning? Since dad left, the house is a complete mess! And you don't help much either. Don't provoke your sister right at breakfast! Romy, it's Steve! Did I have a pimple? Ah, I knew it! As luck would have it, on the day of departure for the holidays! It's you? I'm coming! Oh-la-la! Let's ride hair in the wind like Hollywood stars. I would prefer that you take the train. - Yeah, along with everyone? Where is Romi going? To Breton, to Legree's family. They have a shack by the sea in Belle Isle. Why don't we go on vacation? - Because I have no money. But even Kiki's mother is going on vacation! - Only I'm not Kiki's mother, here! - Don't you see, you're tiring your mother? - I'm not talking to you! - And I say, do not arise! What did you just say? I misheard! Hey Karo, calm down! Well, that's all for now. Let's kiss. Chao, Vincent! - Hey, don't! - Come on! Goodbye, little one. Have a nice vacation! When you get there, call! You say it every time! Otherwise, I will worry. Promise? Oh-la-la. If only you knew how sad I am to leave without you! - Will you bring shells? - Yes, wash them with your mother. Chao. Let's go say goodbye from the balcony. Let's go! Good morning, grandpa! Oh how beautiful. Where is this from? From Morocco. Any news from dad? No. If I'm in the way, just say so! Yes, you're in the way. I don't know where your father is! - I won't interfere anymore. - No, you're not interfering. Nice to know. You come every morning, and besides, you don't call! - So what? - And then. You can find me with someone. With a prostitute? - Wow! Who do you take me for? - For a man. They say your mother wants to put you in the Geek Center? - Yes. But I won't go! - Why? Afraid of not fitting in? Oh, I can't even touch you! - New bag? - Yes. Like? - Not. - Charming. Do you know what you look like? Like Mama Legree. Naturally! I wear her things. You've got to survive somehow since your father passed away. Firstly, only 2 weeks since he left! Secondly, he did not earn anything, so you have not lost anything! - This is something new! - What? What are you saying nasty things about your father. - I'm mad at him. - That's how? With him, I wouldn't be forced to go to that stupid college! - Listen... - I'd rather do humanitarian work... At least in your Literacy Center. And I would feel useful... Don't judge until you see it, huh? Do you know that you are handsome? The speed of insertion into orbit depends on the altitude. As a result, the period of a full turn those. the time it takes for a satellite to orbit the earth will also depend on the height. This period is calculated very simply, based on Kepler's 3rd law, according to which the square of time is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. In the case of the Earth, this period is 100'069 seconds for a satellite orbiting at altitude 0. So, the task that I propose to you is: what will be the time of its complete revolution at an altitude of 170 km? You have 3 minutes. Hey Kiki, look who's there! Yeah, here's the wunderkind! Are you glad to see us? Einstein! You're dressed like a minister! I'm going to Paris to see a tutor. Do you have an IQ of 150? - 140! - Maybe 150 - IQ of his goat? Yes, look, he nods like a donkey! What do you know how, except how to trade shit? We have never been dealers! Dope is bad, don't you know, brat? Now we are fascinated by music. We'll put together a super rap group. Really, Kiki? Yeah. The only thing missing is a singer. Are you interested? Yep, awesome. - Aren't you interested, brat? - Very! To the highest degree! Only I'm not good enough - I can't wheeze like a road roller. Well, with such-and-such a father... I mean, he's a low-flying bird, can get deeply bogged down, if that. - You saw him? - Whom? - My father! - No, I didn't. Then why do you say he's low-flying? - I just know, that's all. - From whom? - There is nothing secret. You weren't asked, fool! What did you say?! Kiki, can we talk face-to-face? Go, I'll catch up. Well? You said my father might get bogged down. What does it mean? If your father doesn't play the fool, then he won't have any problems. But if you know where he is, why don't you tell me? You are no longer ours! I do not understand! A month ago we were friends, I was in your gang... You've been in my gang, you're not like the others. - Why? Because I'm a prodigy? - Look at your clothes! It can be fixed. It's my mother who makes me wear them. I myself am not like that! Listen, I liked talking to you, but now everyone goes their own way. And point! You are alone? Yes, my mother went to the beautician. Your mother is gone to have fun! Yes! Whore! Pay no attention to these fools. Want? - Oh yes, I do. - I'll bring you a new glass. You can give me yours, I'll just try... Don't worry, my freezer is full. - Hey, I want too! - Yeah, run away! We go! - Hold on. - Thanks. Listen Guillaume. I need information about my father. Kiki knows a lot, but he kicked me out of the gang. But you... No, I'm not involved in this! What if my father dies? He's depressed can do anything! - Your father got me already! - I ask you for the last time. Yep, I believe. Heck! Stop knocking, now mom will come! What do you need? Ice cream! Ice cream! Guillaume, you must help me! - But how?! Join Kiki's group! You are crazy? I never wanted to die, and now they're skinning me! - They are now looking for a vocalist. - So what? You will join a band, become a vocalist and find out about my father. - Yes, they will never agree. - And you try, damn it! Don't drift! Or maybe this is your chance in life? With your voice, a manager like Kiki will get you promoted in a year you will be a star. And you can perform on TV, Guillaume! On telly! And you really are smarter than most. Do it, Guillaume, damn it, do it! Stop knocking, I open. Yes! Go to the kitchen, just don't make a mess. Wow, he's got a full fridge! Blimey... Just don't take everything, leave it! Back off! If your mother sees you in her bedroom, she will kill you! Get out before my mother kills you. Get down! Listen... They say you're putting together a group? And looking for loot. You have? And the singer? Band without a singer... - It's not important. - But the Rolling Stones without Mick Jagger... it's like a chansonnier without an accordion. What are you talking about? We are about music, not about folklore! Yes, you sing Gregorian chants! Gregorian? Gregorian chants? Like this? Yes, but we don't need moronic screams and divine chants! Do you think I can't sing? You know, buddy, you broke my buzz. Proclaim the slogan of our district. For me, this is the main thing, this is vital, Life is cruel! Again! Do you think I can't sing? You know, buddy, you broke my buzz. Proclaim the slogan of our district. For me, this is the main thing, this is vital, Life is cruel! Yes! Yes! Yes! Cool! Tomorrow at noon, in my office. - Hello! - Hello. I brought you my daughter. I want you to take care of her. - Can I start? Yes, yes, I paid for everything. Baby, everything is in your backpack: swimsuit, towel. Good? - So, what's your name? - Caroline Le Blanc. They don't ask you! Is that what they say to mom, huh? Her brother will pick her up at 6 o'clock. - Well there is no problem. Can you leave me money for food? But I already paid for everything! - What if I want ice cream? OK. 20 francs should be enough. Just don't tell your brother. Don't tell yourself. Alright, I'm off. Goodbye. Have a good day! Went? Illiteracy CENTER IM. LOUIS CARDO Madam Ambassador, Mr Deputy Prefect, Dear friends of the Municipal Council! The creation of this center for the municipality was a priority. This operation was carried out superbly, quickly, efficiently and intelligently by our Isabelle Leblanc! Isabelle, who will henceforth be entrusted with their management! Bravo! - Who will pick you up? - Brother. And me is dad. And he has a Mercedes! - Is he a minister? - No, banker. Have you seen the time? You are 10 minutes late. If you're unhappy, go home by yourself. Come on backpack. Come on, get in. Ready? So long, Leo! See you tomorrow Caro! What is this blond? - A banker's son. - Are you dating bankers now? Pedestrians, beware! We go! - Hey kid, got a smoke? - I do not smoke! And I'm against pollutants! Where is your courtesy? Here I'll tear your mouth! See you again, I'll go for a walk. All just great. Thanks. See you. Is something wrong, Isabelle? No, it's all good. I've only heard good things about you. Yes, I didn't do anything. And you will do more. How is Vincent doing? - Vincent? - Yes. Oh yes, I was just about to tell you... In the new academic year, I want to send him to a lyceum for children like him. But this institution is located in the south of France, and I have to move. - There is no boarding house? - There is. But I know Vincent. Well, it has never killed anyone before, quite the contrary! Why sacrifice your professional life? But Vincent is the most precious thing I have. Me too. But you won't make him happier by sacrificing yourself. You are young, Isabelle, you are talented. You are positive, hardworking, you have extraordinary energy! You are a beautiful person. I entrusted you with a delicate mission: create this Center for the fight against illiteracy. You got everything up and running quickly, it was wonderful! We need women like you. - US? - Our party. You have everything to be useful in the next elections. I will add that in material terms you will not be offended. What should not be neglected in our time. - And you need an answer... - Right now? No. But don't think too long. You don't get that kind of offer twice in life, Isabelle. It all went very well. Goodbye. Goodbye! See you later! Goodbye. Iza! Is your crisis over? As children? They hardly remember you. Come on, I could tell their news! Romy went on vacation to the Legree family home in Belle Isle. Vincent goes to the center for geeks, and Carolyn is learning to swim at summer camp. Here. I take her out in the morning Vincent picks her up in the evening then they go to the store, prepare dinner. We have fun and it doesn't bother anyone. As you can see, I don't need you anymore. And you have? Everything is fine? Yes, in general, everything is fine. I even cook one business. Yes? What kind of? Dope? Plutonium? Uranus? Bazookas? - I'm serious with you, Isabelle! - I'm serious too. If you're here to say you're going to trade kangaroos, I'm not interested. That is, if I understand correctly... don't you want me to come back? You understood correctly. - But listen, Isabelle... - What's "listen, Isabelle"? - You know how I'm made. - That's it! And I've had enough! I must admit that we have some kind of chemistry... Oh, stop it! - Let me explain... - Nothing to explain here! Understand, I'm almost 40 years old! And I got tired of living like in 20 years, without a future. It's clear? But my vision of the world has completely changed, you know? A real mutation is happening in my head, you can go nuts! I give advice: you go to the end, you completely mutate and change your wife. But this adventure I want to live with you! Good? Why don't we cross the desert together? 2 months in Africa, eye to eye! Don't you think we've already done this? Not? Look, that was 20 years ago. This is what makes me sad in you, Robert! 20 years later, you're asking me to cross the desert again! - What do you suggest? - I'm nothing! You live your life and I will live mine! Man? I don't have one guy, I have two. Three! I have fun with them every night! With the mayor? And with the whole municipality! This is what I can't take anymore about you: your suspicion and suspiciousness! I don't have a man! And I don't need it! I want to be alone! I need all my time for what I'm going to do. What are you going to do? It's my business. Vincent, is that you? - Have you already arrived? - Where have you been? I was with Guillaume. We made a mess there, we had to get out. Is there a mess here? Oops, did your inauguration go badly? No, why? Do not know. You're in bad mood. Bad because you don't help me! - I can't be everywhere! - You could at least be here! Think you are here? Vincent, don't talk to me like that, okay? I'm not your girlfriend, I'm your mother! - Why are you attacking me? - I'm not attacking, just demanding respect! How was it in the center? And I asked how your inauguration went! Now everyone has their own life! Nothing is impossible, provided the creation of a machine flying at the speed of light! Let's turn to Einstein. His theory of relativity shows that the mass energy of any object tends to infinity when the speed of that object tends to the speed of light. As a consequence, it is enough to apply an infinite force so that the object... You know, my merit is not here. I started at 4 and my mother is a pianist. I fell into notes from birth. Is your father also a musician? No. He couldn't take it and left home when I was 5 years old. Now he lives in Canada. And where did you come from? Nowhere. - I.e? - It is hard to explain. - Are you an orphan? - No, I have a mother, but she is very busy now. How? Philology. But this is not a profession! Yes I know. She is now cooking... uh... - A dissertation? - Yes exactly. And what concept does it develop? How do I know! Philology... I prefer computer science. Well, like all men. No, not everyone. I know those who are very far from it. It's obvious you don't belong to them. It's a pity. I was hoping I finally found a guy who is different from all these geeks... Well... I can be terribly retarded too! - I don't think you're stupid. - Not. But I live with people. I don't touch anyone and if I touch, it means that I really want to know this person. Here you are, for example. I could say that you are a virtuoso but you play without soul, without passion, mechanically, without faith. It's like your mother forced you to become a pianist. Not? - What is your name? — Vincent Leblanc. Heck! Where are you walking?! I've been waiting for you for 10 minutes! - We've been gossiping, ma'am. - Concierge gossip, young man! - What kind of boy? - Vincent. He has a very sharp look. Who are his parents? - My father is an orchestra conductor. - And the mother? Administrator of the National Orchestra of Paris. Who knows? This might come in handy. You're right, honey. You have to choose your contacts very carefully. - Is everything okay, mom? - Yes, yes, everything is fine. Can we go to the movies with you tomorrow night? - No, I can't tomorrow. I have dinner. - Again?! And they will be with me more and more often. Guillaume's mother also has dinner every night! You are too kind to Vincent. Do you think so, sweetheart? You do everything just for him. How is it - "only for him"? Firstly, we did not go on vacation because of him. Here's how? The center where he was enrolled is very expensive! - You're talking nonsense. - It's not me talking, but Leo. Who is Leo? My best friend from the pool, the son of the director of Interbank. Looks like we took out a loan from his father to pay for the Vincent Center. And I go to the stupid pool with the poor! - Directly with the poor? - The whole area goes there. - But also the son of a banker? - It's not the same. He was punished. - BUT! What do you mean? - That everything is only for Vincent. And you, then, are an unfortunate, useless poor thing? - Yes. - Yes? Come on my knees, honey. Do you think no one loves you? No. My poor one. What about your Leo? Does he not love you? - Loves. But this is different. - Why is it different? He is not a member of the family. It's the same with my son. Unstoppable! And you still do not know the main thing! He wants to be the lead singer of a rock band! And you don't know their names yet! "Cool Angels"! Oh well, who knows...? When you see bands on TV, you think, "Why not my son?" This pig has a beautiful voice. - Yes? - Well, yes. Once I had a client who was a priest. He wanted to be his protégé, well, in a noble way... - Yes, sure. - And then I found out that he was a homo! Careful, I'm not saying that something happened. I'm sure! But can you imagine the picture? You know my Guillaume. What would he do for ice cream! If he hears me, wretch...! I hear everything, mom! Oh you, damn! - Hit! - Come on. Kiki will be the manager. His black girlfriend is on drums. There is a bass guitar and my voice only keyboards are missing, but that's his problem. Did you know about my father? Do you think I'll just tell you everything? - I paid! - Not. - How is it "no"? - Well, yes. - And who put you in the group? - Say it too, group! Just a minute ago, she was brilliant! Creatively, yes. But in terms of attendants, to buy tools - bullshit! He's changed a lot. Who? Kiki! It's news that he's buying tools. He wants to change his image. We play for little money. Even if just for 500 francs. If you know anything about my father, you must tell me! It is very important! This is perhaps, to be honest, a matter of life and death. No. You don't want to help me for free, even in the name of the old friend? Friendship is a scam. And you've been cheating on me for years. Now I have changed. I don't have butterflies. If you want, I'll find you a keyboard player for the band. A super girl that I met in my center! Well, what is she? I have, physically? I'll put it in front of you, and your fly will burst! No, I'm serious! In what style - in comparison with your sister? The style is the same, but more sexy. - Hot? - Still would! I have to talk to the group. Can't you decide for yourself? But we are a group, brother! A group is a group! Or then not a group. Oh well! I hope you don't write the lyrics. You know what I meant to say... Yesterday with your mother... maybe I was a little cold? You know, you're not the first person my mother has embarrassed. I guess if I invite you to a party won't she be happy? What do you think about this? Well, how? Fabulous! OK. And where will your party be? In my house. - And where's your house? - In the suburbs. - In Neuilly? - Much better. I'll say yes, but my mother will say no. I don't know what kind of mother you have... Super cool! What can not be said about Madame Debacker. She gave her life to for her daughter to become the great pianist of the 2000s. I have no right to let her down. It's not about letting her down. Let's just have some fun. I hate to offend you, but you don't seem to have much fun. Yes? And I think I have nothing to waste time with a bully from the suburbs. But I'll write to your mother anyway. It is also necessary that your letters reach. Don't expect me to give you an address. Today, with the "minitel" - it's easy. Dare! We are on the red list. Debaker Judith, st. University, 24. - You are walking? - I've been waiting for you for 2 hours. Missed you? Mom said that you would pick me up. I obey. Sometimes you can disobey, banana! - Hey! - Hey. - Is Robert here? - In the hall at the back. Every 2 months the driver brings bags of tokens to the mayor's office. Isabelle said it was income from undercover operations. One evening, with laughter. That is... with a laugh your wife told you that every 2 months dirty cash passes through city hall? Well, at that time, we could not even know that one day it might come in handy. The next transit is in a week. OK. So what? We'll take it from. And we'll divide 50 by 50. Are you crazy? When I called you, you said you were in deep shit! I told you to get away from me. Are you a loser and don't want to get out? It's easy to say to someone who has a Mercedes. - Stop fooling around! - You're doing it! I don't want to play gangster. Yes, you are a complete psycho! Don't look at me like that. I know. What I'm suggesting to you is actually not exactly theft. Not! This is dirty money. If we don't take them, they'll serve as propaganda for the assholes who run us. And Isabelle? Are you thinking about Isabelle? If you do that, there will be an investigation and they will get to your wife. I know you've got your back against the wall, and yet... If you need 2-3 thousand francs, I can help you out. - You don't have to rescue me! - Hey, Robert! I don't advise you to do this, Robert. Oh, I'll be embarrassed! How about a week in Corsica? Ides and I rented a villa. Well, like a villa... an improved hut by the water's edge. A week in the sun... diving... pastis, bowling... I understand why you will never be a star. All the best, Jean-Jean. Do you think it's better? Ah, here she is... Isa! Iza! Hey! Are you still an animator? Er... no. No no... I'm rehearsing the show. I was just wondering if City Hall has... No. I saw Robert. Where did you see? He called me. We met with him. At the bistro where we used to go. - At Ahmed's? - Yes. - How is he? Well, physically, it's fine. But in the head - a mess. I.e? He hatches some kind of murky plan. You better talk to him. How can I talk to him? I don't even know where he is. Even his father doesn't know. He will call me in the evening to see if I agree. Agree to what? Nothing. They say that money passes through the city hall in black cash? - I do not know. - Like this? He said he knows from you. He made it up so you would come to me. No, no, I myself came to you to reason with him. But there is no dirty money here! - But since he told me... - So he's crazy. And I go around psychos like the plague. Listen, don't be so harsh! - Do you think he's gentle? - Well, it's just a difficult period. Age, time is running out, no work... 50th anniversary is not far off. Not enough luck, not enough luck, constantly not enough money! Enough for me! If you see him, say so: "I've had enough!" You got me with your stories! Got it! How long are you going to piss us off with your moped? I have the right to make noise until 10 o'clock, fuck you! No, you don't! And you got us! I'll teach you politeness, you scoundrel! Take the baguette, I'll talk to Guillaume and come. - Good. - And you are crazy! - Keep going and you'll see! - Yes, you went! It's incredible! Where is the world heading?! Well? The group settled for your girlfriend. Did you find out about my father? - Yes. Going to rob a bank. Who told you this? Cousin of Kiki's cousin who owns a bar. Your father met a friend there. - And where is this bar? - Contract first. "The market is the market"! I warn you, if you're lying, I'll rip out my kidneys. Just touch it - the whole group will cut your balls off, faggot! I am pleased to note how your vocabulary is expanding. - Vocabulary gives the street. - She gives a stock of vocabulary! Stock! Vocabulary, not vocabulary! Yes, even if there was a special law that defines it, I wouldn't give a damn about him because the law... How do they say when they send...? Shut up, I'm not interested. Come on, get lost! Karo, help put it on the table. It's not my turn today! I said go collect on the table! Do not command! No, give it up! When you put it on the table! If dad were at home, he would show you! But he is not. And the role of the head of the family passed to his eldest son, okay? - Hey, calm down! - Mom, you're so beautiful! Thank you, puppet. I'm not having dinner with you, I have a meeting. - Important? - Not. Not important, but are you wearing a new outfit and high heels? Oh-la-la! When you say that, it's like I hear your father! Every time I put on new shoes he would ask Where are they from, as if someone gave them to me! Estimate! And stop looking at me like a cop! You don't have to be a cop to know what's in your head. - And what's in my head? - You're erasing dad! Don't you think he erases himself? Hello? Yes, don't hang up. Mom, Mom Legree is calling. - You are sick? - You know, that grandma. Hello? Yes, good evening. No, sorry, I'll be right there. I had problems at the last moment. See you! Don't ever do that again. You are crazy? OK. Can I go to dinner at Legree's? Yes. But don't come back too late, you look tired, mommy. - Hello. - Hello, Vincent. - Judith is not here today? Judith is sick. And what? There is nothing. - Oh, hello, Vincent! - Hello madam. Everything is fine? Are you starting to like us? Yes, very much, ma'am. Is that why you skip your astronomy classes? Don't look at me like that. I won't punish you. This is not a prison, not a school, but a place of freedom, where everyone can express himself as he wants. If you prefer music, you can go to music. Good? My father is bad. Can I go home? Wait, I'll call your mom first. Heck... Wait, let's help! Oh, how kind you are! What floor are you on? - I came to visit a friend, Judith. - This is my neighbor in the stairwell! Are you into music too? Yes. We are now preparing a game in 4 hands. What play? I just came for us to choose. In that case, I advise you to immediately go up to the 7th floor. - On the 7th? - Yes. To the servants' room, where her mother locks her up as punishment. Judith! It's Vincent! - Vincent? - Yes! Open! I can not. Mother locked me up. Heck... Yes! Vincent! Vincent! - Judith? - Yes I'm here. And I think where are you going? Help me. Give me your hand. Why are you locked up like this? My mother is a strange woman. - And you never wanted to... - Run away from her? Yes! If I do this, she will die. Well, she wants you to think so. No. These idiots are to be feared. They are great actors, better than us. Will you be here tomorrow? - Tomorrow I will come to visit you. - And your mother? She will not be, she will be at the notary. Give me your adress. Er... no. I'll follow you, it'll be easier. Okay. Look out, she's coming! Yes. What should I do to make you act normal, huh?! You ran away from class like a thief. The headmistress called to find out if your father is really sick! What about you? You don't care! No, don't give a damn! I don't want you to run away without warning! I'm not a child anymore! I got your center! - You said... - Your geeks got me! I don't care what you do, damn it! - Don't talk like that! - Whatever I want, I will do it! Look, don't you dare talk like that! Go to your room! Heck! Oh, it's just impossible! What else? - Vincent at home? - No, he's not. Hey, what are you? Not in yourself? - It seems to me that we did not understand each other. - Yes, we did not understand each other! Goof off somewhere else! Go to hell, fool! - You fool, get out of here! - Mom, what's wrong with you? Go clean your room! Fast! - Hey, calm down! - And shut up! ABOUT! What a family! Guillaume, are you there? Yes. I knew that you would call me. - What did you want to tell me? - About your ancestor. According to Cousin Kiki's cousin, he stole a dozen old computers. And I want to know where he is hiding, bitch! Heifer! Until there is a heifer, you will not know anything. Yes, you went! If I want, I'll ask my cousin Kiki myself! Aha! And you can plug your ears with his squirrel tail so as not to hear how he yells at you. And don't forget! If you want to see your father while he's not in prison, chick! You look nervous. Er... no, no. But I still have to warn you. My friends are not geeks from the center. Don't say anything, dear friend. No, but it can be shocking not to know. I love surprises. And then, you know, I'm not that innocent. For example, music is not Chopin's Nocturne. And then a disco is not quite a disco... Understand? It's here. - Here? - Well, yes. Hey Kiki! It's the chick... it's the keyboard player I told you about. Yes? Okay. - Yes, I understand everything. - I warned you. - Any problems? - No problem. Just a lack of information. Yes, it is clear that the ambush. - Sorry? Yes, it's obvious that's a problem. Where did you get it from? Listen first before judging. Yes, with such an appearance, she is definitely against the music! Here's how? Hey, you! Set the rhythm. Not bad! Cool! Yes, you went! Jerk! You're an idiot, you fat pig! Heck! - Hey, stop it! - Goat! You went! - Shut up! Stop yelling! We didn't agree! I brought a chick! And he doesn't say where to find my father! Yes, you went! You may be a child prodigy, but that doesn't stop you from being a jerk! Enough! If I understand correctly, you used me? Well no! You gave me wings and you took them away yourself. Liar! - I'll explain everything to you. - Not worth it. - Judith! Let me go! - Wait a minute! Hey, wait, wait... Damn! Do you know that you play cool? We're having fun here. We are a group, and he is a goat. I'll explain everything to you now. Dad? - Vincent? - Well, yes. Wow! I could say it's you! But I didn't know you were here. - I could cut you in two! Well, next time. Idiot is unfortunate. Listen, dad, since you left, everything in the house is messed up! If this continues, my mother will become depressed. Come on! I've been preventing your mother from leading the life she dreamed of for 20 years. - No that's not true! - Do not insist, Vincent! It's over between me and your mother. Don't talk about her anymore, please. Prefer to talk about your business? - About what business? - Everyone is talking about! Some even call you a scoundrel. Nice! And you want me to go back to live there? No, I overdid it. Nobody called you a scoundrel. But about the deeds - the truth. They say you stole all the computers from the college. - I? Thief? - Are these the same computers? But this... this... Jean-Jean and I are picking up in the garbage. With that actor, remember? By the way... you treated Jean-Jean badly! It's to help you pay your rent. You need to get out, dad! You can't die like a rat! We all need you! The house is a complete mess, the washing machine is broken, everything is bad! And before, with you, everything was cool, as in advertising! I don't care about your life, Vincent. I have black holes... Nobody can see them only those who are already there. But for you... It's like being in space. Do you know space? So... I'm right there. Not! You are alone - in the house of the tiger. You just need to overcome 10 steps to get out of the darkness. Listen, get out, Vincent. Get out. Vincent! Tell your mother that I will send her the money as soon as I can. If I leave. Do you want to dump? Yes, I have ideas on this subject. But if you betray me, it will happen sooner. You understood me? Okay, you can trust me. But on the other hand, you must not betray me! I mean all your dealings with Jean-Jean! I don't want you to go to jail. Bye. Where are you from? I went to see erotic paintings. In a den? At the Picasso Museum, fool! I may be a fool, and you are a scoundrel. I? Why didn't you say you have a dad? To keep you away from him. So I say - you're a scoundrel! And in the face do not want? Catch first! In this condition... Hooligan! You will end up like your father! And my father won't end up the way you think! And now the waves! Reminder: it is forbidden to dive and jump, throughout the duration of the waves. Mom, look! Let's! Let's! Well done, pup! Come on, I'll help you get out. Ready to take it? Yes, sure. Give me your hand. Give a hand! Op-la! Come on, come here! Come on, jump! - Was it a good day? - Excellent, yes. Tell. - I was not in the center. - Thanks I know. - Well, now, I... - And what did you do? - I saw my dad. - What?! But, mother, I won't tell you where he is. It is forbidden! Not yet. - Did he call you? - Not. Tell me, Vincent! - He's doing pretty well. - That's how? And he still loves you! What? Stop! Stop it hurts me! I won't tell you anything! Let me go! You will stay here! Let me go! Come in! Like this! And if you don't tell me where you've been today I'll lock you up here all summer! I won't sit here! I'll climb out onto the roof and throw myself off it! Judith! Judith? Judith! Stop making such stupid jokes! Hey, show yourself! Show yourself! Judith! Where are you?! Judy-and-it! Everything, get down. Keep your backpack! Come the evening. Until the evening! Hey! Hello boy, how are you? Well? I left home. Is your mother at home? No, I am alone. She went to Marseille for the day. There is a school for geeks there. Yes I know. Yes? And how is it? - Fine. - Have you been there? No. They don't teach music there. I have a friend who studied there. She received her diploma at the age of 13. Admitted to the University. At 14?! - IQ 140, my friend! - Oh, me too! Here's how? Yes. Everything is ready. Thanks. My feet are small, right? No... do you want orange juice? No thanks, that'll do. You are walking? I now! Everything in the system? I can hardly imagine us with a child. You also need to be able to have it. The psychologist told me that I am an early development. This does not mean that you are developed in every sense. Sexually, you're only 12, Vincent. You are still young to make love. - You do not want? - Not. Then why did you reach out your hand to me? I want to be closer to you. Have you already made love? - Hello? - Vincent? Yes it's me. Do you know where Judith is? No, no, I didn't see her. Who is this? Center director. Wants to talk to you. - Let's. - What are you! I said you're not here! Hello? Judith on the wire. I assume my mom is next to you? Yes, she is here. Give her the phone. She wants to talk to you. Hello, honey! Why are you doing this to me? I turned heaven and earth to find you! Even called your father in Canada. Listen, mom, it's okay. But I need to rest for a couple of days. I did everything you made me do for 14 years! I obeyed, fulfilled all your whims of an offended pianist! But now you leave me alone! And I warn you: appear here - not the red carpet awaits you! Where will you live for these few days? - Here. - Here?! - Is it a problem for you? Not for me, but my mom... I thought she was super cool? Yes. But not in everything. I'm not a plague. I know how to behave. I know, but she can be understood... She is very nervous right now... Grumbles on every nonsense. So I'm stupid? Well no! But you must understand... To understand what? What are you not noble at all? If you had warned me, I could have arranged something. - Can't you improvise? We don't have a maid's room! OK. If that's how you feel about it... Life is part of our party. We are firmly on the ground. Young people have a very difficult time. Young people are waiting for stress, unrest and problems. You are waiting for blows, slaps and elbows. Don't be nervous, stay relaxed. Otherwise it will only get worse In the face of problems that stand in the way. Life is not easy. Life is cruel! Hey pa! - Hello son. - Did you go out? What for? There are more and more computers. A. Jean-Jean brings me this. What for? I have one idea. What's an idea? So... Tell me better about yourself. BUT? Do you keep going to that center? - Yes. - And what do they teach you there? Most importantly, I learned to be confident in myself. I don't know how to explain it... As it turned out, I was too closed in myself. And there I was taught to take the height, take the width... be positive. Well, any such bullshit. But this is not the most important thing. What is the most important thing for you? For you to come back to us. You come here every day, but you can't bring your father back! We must be cunning, play differently! But how? - Jealousy, my boy! - Jealousy? Yes, jealousy! There is nothing better to wake up a man! Might as well throw them out my window. Don't worry, no one is home. Right? Listen, is there "Blond" or what? - Blond. Nothing? - Oh, yeah... Blondes, brunettes - in principle - all the same. - This thing is heavy! - Still would! This is my whole life! You didn't think I'd leave her outside, did you? Come on, come on! Yes, it's Versailles! - Well, not really... - Oh, yes, yes! Beautiful! This is what my father did. Look at the shelves. Come on, I'll show you! Look - he made a countertop, a tile, all cabinets, all drawers, shelves - he did everything himself! Yes, listen! Beautiful! Good job! Well done your father. Listen, won't he break in now? No. He left home long ago. Ah, damn. I'm sorry. Look - here is what is left of his workshop. Actually, he's a radio technician. If I wanted to, I could become a super engineer! Yes, just like me. I could go to military school. Truth? Yes, but I have one leg shorter than the other, so it didn't work out. But that doesn't stop me from being an engineer. - Yes, but... But it interferes with marching, that's the problem! Imagine, July 14 at the parade on the Champs Elysees - Military School cadet marching like this, limping! Doesn't fit, you know? Yes... That doesn't work, that's the problem... Oh yes, cigarettes! Let's go. Yes, cigarettes... Hold. Take more! No, no, I don't want to deprive someone of... No, it's friends forgot! Come on, we don't smoke. Take everything. Thanks, that's nice. Would you like something to drink? Yes, I won't refuse. Tea, orange juice, cola, milk? Do you have cold foam? It would be heaven! Now I'll take a look. Awesome! - Have a seat! - No no... Hold. Sit down, make yourself at home. Thanks. Yes, it's still great to have a roof over your head. Thunderstorms were predicted in the evening. If you want, we can give you shelter in my sisters' bedroom. No, no, don't. I have film. What if lightning strikes a tree? Well... then it would be total bad luck. To be honest, do you think you're lucky right now? It's true, I don't have any luck, but... It would be a shame to be crushed by a tree, at the very moment when you are offered help! But I don't force you to do what you want! Yes... I'm a little embarrassed, but... Yes! Hey! It's mom! Robert? Robert? What are you doing here? It was your boy who asked me to take a bath. And who are you? Don't you recognize me? No. You pass by without noticing me... You have been walking past me with your Carolina for 2 weeks now. Homeless at the entrance! It's me! Yes understood. Well, yes, it's understandable. What came over you to bring this guy into the house? You are crazy? I'm sorry, but the poor need help. You tell him to get out immediately! - I'll tell you, don't be afraid! - Will you? - Yes. So you say? Why did you put in 4 appliances if you won't leave it for dinner? Sorry! Can't find a razor. So go shave somewhere else! - What are you, mom! - And you be polite! Here, Vincent, I think your mother is right. You weren't asked to comment! Listen, what a strict lady! She's always like that when she likes a man. Do you like my robe? You didn't hesitate! Hold. And you will not have "Gilette"...? Not! I don't have a Gillette. And if you are not satisfied with our conditions, I will not detain you! - No, what are you, everything is fine! - All the better. Come to yourself. Do you know that you are psycho? Don't swear, I swear he's not bad. But you don't know what's in his head! He won't cut our throats with a one-time "Beak"! And in general, many people with loot are much worse than him! - Okay, let's not argue. - Why are you moping? - I'm not moping. - Oh well! If your father were here, you would never have done this! But he wouldn't swear that I'm helping a poor man. I waited 2 hours for Vincent! Oh, I completely forgot about you! How did you get there? One! On foot! You could meet me! Don't yell at me, and neither will you. Look, I took the liberty of borrowing some things... I threw mine in the wash. And they didn’t take the worst ones! I still have a sense of taste, dear lady. Who is this? Uh... daddy's cousin. Yeah, well... a distant cousin. Hey pa! Hello. How are you? Okay. How is your mom? Also good. She's got a friend, look! Yes? Funny! Reminds me of a homeless person who settled at our entrance. All I know is that he drives carts. He won't be with us for long. - Yes, great! - Mom, I want cocoa! Yes, drink cocoa. Oh, listen, this dinner was delicious! Nothing special... I haven't felt this good in a long time! - You are walking? - Where are you two going? - Let's take a walk. - But not to long! I won't refuse... And if you still have some coffee... Shall we lie down? Here? If anything, I have a mattress in my basement... So romantic! Where were you today? Went to rehearsal with friends. - Everything goes well? - Yes. I just don't feel like I belong among them. Besides... Besides? Kiss Me. Hello, Gilbert! - Hey. I am making breakfast. You are walking? Yes, yes, now. Hey Judith! Judith? Where is Judith? She's left. Her mother became ill. What?! Judith! Wait! Why did you leave without telling me anything? Forgive me, Vincent, for doing this, but we will not meet again. But you can't leave me! Especially after what happened last night! We kissed. So what? I didn't tell you, but... I'm leaving with artists of the same age on tour to Canada. You should have told me! Is it possible? Girls have their own ways of defending themselves. I didn't mean to hurt you. But it's disgusting! In any case, know one thing: I will never forget what I experienced with you. You will forever remain in my heart. Come on, you're not the first man to be dumped by a slut. She's not a slut! Yes, not a slut. But a woman leaving a man like that... it's not very fair. You haven't lost anything, trust me. BUT? How are your friends doing? Guillaume? We don't see each other anymore. They have a group, they rehearse day and night. What are they playing? They don't play, they spew their hatred. Blimey! It would be good for you to sing with them. It would be useful for me to have you come home! I'll tell you honestly: or you will calm down, Or you won't see us again! Because we all got it! It's easy to hide from reality in your father's barn! Can you calm down? Sometimes I want to punch you in the face! Are you crazy? Your grandmother left you, and your father is to blame? Mom is right - you're an asshole capricious old man, unable to notice that everything is changing, nostalgic for old stinky values! Is that what your mother said about me? Why be ashamed? That's why she found a man to go to! What is this bullshit? Hey! Hey, is there anyone here? - Monsieur? - Open the damn thing! Who are you? Isabelle's husband. - E... slippers! - What are "slippers"? To walk here, you need to wear slippers. What if I say this is my house? Yes, but I'm leaving. And I want my work to be respected! Do me a favor, get out of my house! - Wait, Monsieur Robert... - I said to bring down, then, go! - Okay, but I wouldn't want to... - Pack your suitcase! It's impossible, I don't have it. - How is it, "no suitcase"? - No suitcase. This we will see. Er... Monsieur Robert! My things are in the girls' room. - What the hell is this? - My suitcases. - Your suitcases? - Well, yes. I don't know what you imagined, but I just got adopted. - I don't understand anything. Your son invited me. I was so good, I didn’t ask anyone for anything. But he told me: "Yes, yes, let's go, my mother agrees help a bum..." So you're a bum? Well, yes. You can't see it because I'm in your shirt and shaved... But... Can not be! Well, if you don't believe me, I have a certificate... Yes, I'm not talking about this with you! I'm talking about my son! Oh Vincent! Ah, well that's... I didn't want to get into something that doesn't concern me, but... I don't think your boy did it by accident. Yes, I understood that. Ha! He takes me for an idiot! Yes. And me too. Here's the bastard! Ah, bastard... Yes - a bastard is a bastard, but not a fool. Not a fool. Hey, stop snoring! Shh! Crap! Karo! Stop it, Carolina! Mother! What's the guy in the bed? Your father's cousin. I didn't know you'd be back so early! With Steve - just hell! He's such a jerk! Such a jerk! Here's how? - You know? - Not. I almost threw myself off a cliff once, he's such a jerk! Yes? But your father warned you! By the way, any news from dad? - Not. Would you like a tincture to calm down? Drop it. I'm tired of everything, I don't want to move anymore. I want to lie down and sleep. - Go here. Oh, how tired I am... Oh my darlings... Let's sleep... Why are you leaving? Ah... well... I'm suffocating here! But you won't go far? - Well no... I'm going on vacation to Paris. And good luck to you guys! - Bye then. And thanks! - Bye! Be healthy, my Vincent! LITERACY CENTER Find the difference between the expressions presented here... Hello Isabelle. Sounds like a good teacher, doesn't it? - Good! Hooked on! - You too. I don't have day to day. - Have you thought about my proposal? - Yes Yes. - Tempting, huh? - Very! But at the same time... Let's say there are other priorities. - Think of yourself, Isabelle! - I think. But I have a family, so I doubt it. Well, if you win the election, you won't have a second to doubt. To be honest... I do not feel very well in the world of politics. Well, I can't twist your arms. But make up your mind. I give you a week. - Good. - Goodbye, Isabelle. Goodbye, Madame Legree. Did she ask you? Yes. I will refuse. I do not understand you. There is nothing to understand. Hey Vincent! Are you going to your classes? - Yes. And you? - I don't do anything. Well? What's "what"? - Shall we reconcile? - Not. Tell your snob that the group is waiting for her. It will take a long time to wait - she went to Canada. Will you see her? No. Case is closed. Well, in a way, you can, it's better that way. I'm changing these women... Yes, it's easier for me, as the vocalist of the group, to shoot women. On the other hand, I think it's better. What's better? Yes, change girls all the time in life! The only one? Thanks, that's not enough for me. BUT? Do not you agree? BUT! Yes, yes, yes... Yes, probably... You know, Vincent, I thought a hell of a lot. Especially since I started writing lyrics. Well, yes... in what genre? In what genre, in what genre... These intelligent questions! The genre of my songs is my genre! - Psychic! - And you're still the same moron. I don't think we have anything else to talk about! Goat. We are moving anyway. - That's how? Where? - South. It's not because of you, but because of me. Rather than send me to a boarding school, my mother decided that we would all go together. Did she find anything farther away? - He's the only one. - Okay. And that center where you go in Paris? They only work in the summer and on weekends while studying. It's more like a club. Ah, got it. And when are you moving in? At the end of the holidays. - Turn on the light. - Yes. Gift from my father. Do you know how much he paid? - Not. - 3 thousand! Expensive, right? - Yes. - But it's a great gift. Hey, did you see that car? Yes, I saw. He also beeps, you hear? Yes, I heard. To whom is he making signs? Oh... I don't know. Ah, here's my father. Till tomorrow? Yes, see you tomorrow. Can't you see that I'm giving you signs? - I did not recognize you. - Oh well... There aren't many cars like mine. Yes. What do you need? Are you mad at me too? - Yes. Why? Are you asking why? You left us and you ask why? It doesn't look like you're in a lot of pain. Where have you been? He left to do business. Will I take you home? BUT? Let's go to. Can you give this to your mom? Why don't you give yourself up? Don't ask too many questions, Karo! Your mom and I are going through a difficult period right now. But everything will be fine. And yet, goodbye! What are you doing? I'm moving. - I didn't kick you out. - Not. I'm leaving myself. Like this, no warning? I leave you to your favorite pastime - solitude. But do you have time for coffee? I'll have a drink on the way. Ah... well, okay. Before you leave, go to the office. I have something for you. Vincent? Run here quickly! Your father wants to leave. Where? He doesn't tell me. Come, maybe he will be more talkative with you. - Hold him. I am running. - Good. You wanted to see me? Yes. Because I don't know if we'll ever see each other... I thought maybe I should let you go not entirely empty-handed. I tried to talk to him, to detain him - nothing happened. You didn't even ask where he went! I tell you, I asked 100 times! You know your father - it's like a demon possessed him. - Everything was bullshit! - What bullshit? Make dad jealous! I told you it wouldn't help! Just a minute, my boy! If you want to rave - go back to the area to your friends. I'm sure it was you who pushed him to leave! He is your son! And before that, he kept it to himself, like an old miser. Miser? I? And the telescope I gave you? This is your friend's gift. And the 3 months that you lived with me - you and your family? You annoyed us so much that we had to move out. But you, too, are not the cutest family! Come on, keep yelling, and then you get hit. Aren't you ashamed to talk to me like that? Besides, I note, I did not let your father go empty-handed. I.e? I gave him my Picasso. You know, a little cubist painting? But she's not worth anything. - Yeah, how! - She's very small! - Written before the war! The rarest copy! Happy fool! Maybe it's fake? If it was fake, it wouldn't cost 80 grand! 80 grand?! That's it! Of course, what I told you is ultra confidential! State secret! Promise. I'll send everything to the warehouse while we look for an apartment. It makes more sense to find an apartment before you move, no? Oh... we have to move before the start of Vincent's year. Here's the devil! Vincent again! And we? We'll go to the hotel. Yes? Four of us in a hotel room? Oh, what are you grumbling about! I got two numbers! Aha! Where do you get the funds from? No, I don't have the funds. Therefore, we will not stay at the hotel for more than 2 weeks. Do you want to find an apartment in 2 weeks? I found this one in 2 hours. Not surprising! Nobody else wanted her. Oh, stop it! And roll carefully! - You know? - What? I feel hot. What if I'm pregnant? Again?! ABOUT! Are you looking at me? Mother! Are you looking at me? Yes, we're watching! - Are you looking at me? - That's all we're doing, blonde! I'm not calling you, but my mother. Yes, I'm looking at you. Let's! Yes, great! Mom, come help me! - Come on, mom! - I don't want... Come down, come down, please! Thank you, puppet. Massage me right here. - You burned out. - Yes, right here. See? And how is your girlfriend doing? Which? Well, you don't have 36. - Judith? - Yes. We didn't stick. So is it over? I don't know... She went to Canada for an internship in music. Her father lives there, so... Are you looking at me? I'm looking at you, darling! This is Dad! Dad! - My daddy! - Let's! And I? Do I smell like gas? No, no, you don't smell like gas, but it's still bad. I'm bored, damnit! All right, my Vincent? My favorite daddy! - Dad, get wet! - You're just jealous of me! Nasty! No, don't swear today - the day I returned! And not with empty hands! Yes? Did you bring gifts? Yes. I have one present. One gift for all. What is it? Dad! You keep getting better and better! Well, you're fine too. Dad, what is this present for everyone? - Gift? - Do you know what it is? I'll swim first, and then we'll see. Carefully. Hold on properly! Vincent! Look, he left us, it's no coincidence. One two Three! Open up. What's this? Oh, how cool! Ah, I see you couldn't resist? I'm here too. It is 20 km from Marseille. Yes? Vincent will be able to come home every evening. - Great! - Unless you have other plans. No. But you could keep me posted. - I kept it. - Like this? Well, yes! Karo, I gave you a letter 2 weeks ago. - Is it true, Karo? - Yes. Why didn't you give it to us, banana? - I forgot. - And what did you do with him? - I do not remember. - You're a fool, little sister! Well no. - Come on, don't be scared! - No, it's scary! Okay, stop it. It's just that if they gave me this letter... You should have read it right away! Your dad is right about something. Yes... Okay, back to our plans. If you don't like it, no big deal. I have just signed a purchase commitment. - What? - Yes, I decided to buy. Buy? But how... Are you asking about money? - Well, yes... - Did you rob someone? - No, not at all. 2 weeks ago in Cannes, on the Croisette, I met a very rich old lady... Rave! This is crazy, dad! It's very stupid, but very funny. Well, racing? Attention! I believe: one, two... Come on mom! Let's! Today is Sunday, so no one is there. Would have come on Friday, then they would have seen! Voila! It's like repairing cars... Only there are computers. I see. Now I understand why you filled Grandpa's basement. - You were in the know? - No no. - How is it "no-no"? - Just don't start! - She's right! - I think it's a brilliant idea. And what is her genius? It is impossible to find spare parts for 2-3 year old cars. And the poor fellow with computer problems... will be terribly glad to find a workshop, like dad's. Vincent, hurry up, I've found a new game! You already made one happy. And I have a home for you. I registered it in your name. Yes, so that she herself spent on it. Angry! It's great, isn't it? Yes, it's brilliant! Well, yes! Here you can do whatever you want! Yes, that's great! And the air... Do you feel how clean the air is? Damn, I can't believe it! There is no pool here! There is a sea! Is this not enough? How about shopping? There is no shop here! You will fish! How can I get to the disco? On an octopus? I understand why it's so cheap, this shed. Listen, I'll tell you what! You are starting to piss me off! Yes, it's just heaven, honey!
