Ow. Who fucking told you? Hellen. Don't fuck with me. Motherfucker. Goddamn men, you know. Big Al thinks the worst thing you can do is sleep with another guy, right? Let another guy fuck you. Oh yeah? But it's okay for him to fuck other girls, right? He did it all the time. It's a double standard, right? But only on his side. Yeah, well that don't fly with me, you know? I, you know what? I just don't get it. I don't get why, why guys think they're the ones that are getting over. You know, why they think they're the ones doing the fuckin', all right? 'Cause, you know, when I sleep with a guy, I make sure he knows who's fucking who. And I stick my finger up his ass just so he knows it. You didn't sell Clancy the .45 with the two tone stainless, did you? Huh? What? The .45. No, I'm not an idiot. I know that's your gun. Yeah. It's the only one I have that's legally registered, okay? Come on, put your fingers. I'm getting horny. I know. Baby, don't fuckin' touch the .45, okay? Okay. You wanna know about Al? Al is really good at getting things. Cars, jewelry, clothes. Women. But he doesn't know how to take care of them. I was his property. And call me crazy, I just wanted something a little bit more than that, okay? So we broke up, and now no one will date me, all the guys are scared. I gotta date guys from Jersey, it's horrible. What? God, it's Vic. Aw fuck, it's the dyke from the brook. Yeah. Oh, shut up, she's my friend. Be nice, one second! Can't fucking stand her. She always ruins everything. Shut up! She's bisexual, okay? So what? She's still a fucking dyke. You have to remind me about your fling with her, huh? It was one drunken night. Don't be such a fucking woman. Fuck. One sec, sweetie. Hi. Hello, lover. How are you, beautiful. I am great. Please, no lesbo action in front of me, okay? Unless it's a threesome, come on. Don't mind him. That's all right, I'm used to his slime. Charm, charm, Al. Hey, how you doing? You look so great. Oh my god, your hair looks amazing? You like that? Don't you think her hair looks great? Looks like she did it with a wrench of something. - Just shut up. - Nice to see you too, buddy. Sit down. You want something to drink? Sure. Hey. She lives with me now, lesbo, okay? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it would seem so, seeing as I knocked on your front door and she answered it and everything, Al. You confused yet? What? Drunk yet? Come on babe, you can do it. It's that obvious, is it? You fucking drunk. Come here, baby. Fuck! Son of a whore! Al, stop it! Jesus Christ! You sir are a moron. You are the walking talking reason that we should all be lesbians. Yeah, I think I just became one. So, your hair looks amazing. Thank you. It really looks good. Plus you know I've bee, uh, I been hitting the gym a lot. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. I've already added like two inches to my arms, an inch to my chest. Nice. Trying to get those big shoulders so I can beat up Al. I wanted Al dead from the moment I met him. It was his maleness that I detested. His essence. It wasn't his fault. He couldn't get away from it, you know. It was him. He was the product of his horrible childhood. But... Yeah, see what you're missing? See you later, huh? No tongue fucking action while I'm away, girls. I just came in her five minutes ago. Thanks for the head's up. Get outta here. Is it good? So who's it for? Jose Vargas. What? The one thing we gotta stick to is I didn't sell it to Jose, okay? Al would kill me if he knew I sold to a Puerto Rican. As long as he doesn't think I sold to a Puerto Rican, we're fine, we're fine. He's just the muscle. I'm the broad with all the plans, right? I'm the businesswoman, I got the big plans. You got big plans? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I hope I'm in them. Hmm. You know you are. Kat, if he hurts you again, I'll fucking kill him. That's a promise. Hmm? My daughter Kat. Yeah, she was always attracted to danger. Yeah, even as a little girl. She was always doing something that she wasn't supposed to do, I mean, you tell her not to do something, she would do it anyways. "Don't drink", she'd drink. "Don't do drugs", she did drugs. "Watch out for boys,". Forget about it. I mean she was just always defiant. She just always wanted too much, you know. She could never just be normal. She always had to be special. And look where it got her. Yeah, well, I am not surprised. She was always beautiful and most proud of her hair, and she got that from me. Reilly, Reilly, Reilly, Reilly, you get more ass than a fucking toilet seat. I'm talking about some quality ass. Yeah, quality, shit. Yeah, Dona Valetti sleeping on your bed. But you got Kat. Yeah, well. You can't have everything, right? What do you think of me going back with Dell again? Aw fuck, Reilly, will you please fucking get over her, she's a fucking ho. Fucking been fucked in the ass so many fucking times her ass looks like a science experiment. What can I tell you? She turns me on. Everything turns you on. You're the horniest guy I know, Reilly. You would do anything for a piece of fucking pussy. I've decided to turn over a new leaf. What? I'm going back to church, becoming Catholic again, renouncing it all. Reilly. I'm so fucking sick and tired of hearing this song and dance, I've heard it all before, all right? That's it for me, man. I want a normal life. Have a normal life, get a normal job. What are we doing here? What are we doing? Don't fucking worry about it. Nothing illegal, all right? I told you, I started this morning, I'm turning over a new leaf. Leaf. Reilly, you need to turn over a new fucking tree. You know, there's always a place for you in my organization. Why don't you come and be my right hand man again, huh? You not hearing me, man? What the fuck are you talking about? I was never your right hand man. I was my own man with my own operations. I did my own fucking jobs. Jesus Christ, I never worked for you, Al! You fucking need me, Reilly. Ya need me. Bullshit, Al. The only fucking thing I need from you is a woman like Kat. That's what I need. What the fuck is it with this Kat obsession? It's not obsession. It's just she's a great girl, that's all. Hey, pull it over here. What's going on, Al? I'm gonna steal that car. That's the fucking car we took last week. Yeah, that's right. But now I gotta fucking take it back. The guy we stole it from wants it back. He's got a big fucking reward. I thought I'd be a nice guy and I'd take it back to him, okay? What about the guy we sold it to? Fuck him. He's a fucking nother normal guy at work, just like you wanna be, a normal guy. You know what happens? Normal guys get fucked, Big Al doesn't. You're about to make a month's salary in 10 seconds. Are ya in or are ya out, Mr. Normal? It's the last time, Al. This is it. Last motherfucking time. Al shoulda got outta this neighborhood. Kat wanted that. And as things turned out Al should have listened to her. Did I wanna kill Al? Yeah, many times. Did he have something I woulda killed for? Yeah. Hello, ladies. You got the money? It's right here. Let's have it! Why don't you get it from me. Asshole. Chill, chill, I'm just joking. Just joking, come here, baby, I'm just joking. You know I wouldn't play you like that, right? Yeah, all right. You know I like doing business with you, know that, right? Oh yeah? Well same as always, Duvic, all right? Now get your paws offs me. I'd like to do a lot more with you, baby. Who wouldn't? You need a man like me, baby, you know? I could show you a couple things, you know what I'm saying? - Oh yeah? My boyfriend, Big Al, he wouldn't like that very much, okay? I'll get rid of your boyfriend, Big Al. Not interested, Sanchez. Keep walking, thanks. Could you? Could you get rid of him? Nothin', like nothin'. Why you with him anyway? He's small time. A beautiful lady like yourself. You need to be with a man who's going places in life. You see me right here? I'm going places. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Like Ryker's. That's where you're going. See you later, Chico. I'll never want to fuck you or your attitude. Shit, you can fuck my attitude, but I'm a hell of a lot more fun, baby. See ya around. Mita, mm. I can never, never thank you enough, detective. Reid. It's amazing, there isn't even a scratch on it. Thank you so much. Sure. And if there's anything I can do for you. Nah, I'll have the station contact you in the morning, okay? - Okay. - Thank you. Anything. Thanks. Thank you so much. To me, sex with men is like snow. You never know how many inches you're gonna get or how long it's gonna last. You know, and the differences between men and women are just too great for me to even begin to comprehend. You know, like, like, okay, a woman, all she wants to hear from a man are three words, right? "I love you." A man, all he wants to hear are three words too, but they're different. "It's so big!" Right? Wha? Assholes! To me, Big Al is the perfect reason to legalize abortion. You talk about sex more than any girl I know. You're like the horniest girl I know. It's being around you that makes me horny. Oh, fuck off. When are you gonna dump Al? Serious? Come on, Vic. Oh, look. We're having fun, right? I mean come on, it's bad timing. I'll wait for you. I mean what do you two have in common, anyway? Guns. We both love guns. And we're both in love with him. That's what we have in common. You're in love with him? Yeah, Vic, I am. I'm sorry, but... No, hey, know what? Possession is not love. Alcoholics can't have lovers, they hold hostages. And he is no good for you. I am. I'll even treat you like shit if you want me to. Thank you, let's go. - Huh. - You're late, you fuck. So somebody's gotta make a fucking living around here. Shit. Look at Reilly. Dumb. Dumb and confused. No, dumb like takes two hours to watch 60 minutes kinda dumb. I think I'm gonna head home with Vic tonight. Good luck. She's a fucking beast. You know she prefers pussy, right? It's a challenge. Yeah, well I wouldn't fuck her. She can't be that bad if Kat puts up with her. What's that supposed to mean? Hi, girls. - Hey. - Hi. What are you laughing about? Hey, I wanna talk to you in the back. Reilly, how are you? Good. - Hey. - Oh, I see. Hey. - Hey! - What? Fuck's sake. Do you see what I gotta deal with? Come on. Wait, I'm comin'. My drink. Hey Vic, could I buy you a beer? I don't drink. I'm Irish, been Irish my whole life. Really? What a coincidence. Look, Reilly, I'm not, uh... I wasn't born in Ireland, but my family was. They got the greatest brogue, my parents. You gotta hear 'em some time. And my mom, she makes the best Irish oatmeal in town Really, she make those cute little sweaters too? Yeah, she does, actually. Oh my god. She does. She must have a set of those sweaters that go back to the early 1800s, I think. She knows all those Irish songs, Danny Boy and shit. And my father, he knew the guy who invented Irish Spring soap. How about that, yeah? Everyone in this whole fucking neighborhood was Irish. All right, I get it, you're Irish. Just relax, eat a fucking potato. What? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm, uh, not feeling like myself tonight. I'm a little agitated. No worries, right? What nationality are you? I'm Jewish. Oh yeah, Jewish? Where's that from? The Bible. That must go really far back and stuff, huh? Yeah, it does. Where do most Jews come from? Long Island. Now would you leave? ♪ I'm not afraid I heard you slept with some women. So, what about it? Nothing. So have I. Really? Good for you, Reilly. Your mom must be really proud of you. Now would you do me a favor please and just fuck off? Wait, am I bothering you or something? No, I'm always this hostile when I don't like someone. I really like horror films. I tell you that? Yeah, I like 'em a lot. I might go see one on Friday night, you wanna come with me? Jesus, Reilly! You are a fucking horror film. Buddy, take the hint, all right? Move on to your next victim. I'm not interested, all right? Why not? Because all you wanna do is dip the stick. That's not true. That's not true? Nah. Jesus. You're so tough, you know that? All right. Gimme one good reason why you won't let me poke you. - One good reason? - Mm. Well don't take this personally, but I don't - like you. - That's not a reason. That's an excuse. Reilly. That's what that is. Look, you don't want me anyway. You want Kat. But you can't get her. Yeah, there's only one problem there. What? Al. Why don't you knock Al off? Do us all a favor, get rid of him. Maybe then she could be yours. Al's my friend. I don't do friends. I don't do things like that. It's a mere detail. Come on, Reilly, be bold. Try something new. Do a friend. I mean he doesn't like you, anyway. He talks shit about you behind your back all the time. Oh yeah? Like what? Tell me. You're not afraid of him, are you? Hell no. So get rid of him then. He thinks you're a punk. Fuck, I'm not doing things like that anymore. I'm making some changes and I'm really following my religion now and stuff. Following your religion? How sweet. I think it's a little late for that, don't you? All of this very stimulating conversation is making me have to go to the bathroom and throw up. Wait. Come on, can I have you, huh? Come on. I want you. All right. All right, Reilly. There is one way that I will sleep with you. Get rid of Al. You're pretty demanding, huh? You should see me in bed. You're a good guy, Reilly. Thanks. You should think about it. I will. I'm worth the trouble. Yeah. I bet you are. He's now a fucking good Catholic boy. What's going on? - Nothing. - Okay. Fucking don't play the Romans, turn the other fucking cheek, you know, like, fuck you. Hey, hi, Reilly, how's it going? Yeah. You're beautiful, you know? Are you fucking drunk? I wanna kiss you right now. You're fucking drunk. I've always wanted you to be my girl. Hey Reilly! Come on, you're up. I'll be over there in a minute! I'm coming! Papa's calling you, Reilly. You come with me and I'll get you outta this fucking neighborhood. You know he won't. And one for Kat. Yeah. Quite a catch, eh, that Reilly. He's pretty hot. Pretty sexy. Sexy? I thought you were in love. Just because I ordered dinner doesn't mean I can't see what's on the menu, huh? Well, I don't know if your waiter told you, but I'm one of the specials this evening. Shit! Look who just walked in. Fuck! Assholes. I told them never to come here. What's up, my mamita? Got a light for my cigarette? You fucking crazy coming round here? What the fuck are you doing here?

I want to suck your cock! Oh, baby. Baby. I'm gonna cut your fucking hair. No! Fuck you! No! Get off me! It's the only way you're gonna learn. It's the only way you're gonna fucking learn, baby. It's the only way you're gonna fucking learn, baby. Come here! I wanna spend the rest of my life with you, you fucking cunt! Help! Help! I'm gonna get you a new mirror baby, tomorrow. I'll get you a new mirror tomorrow. There's no excuse to go around treating people the way that he did. There are some people out there who've had childhoods far worse than Al's go on to do great things. Become model citizens, you know? Like, there's a secretary that I used to know. She had a very terrible childhood, like, too bad to get into. Like raped, incest, ate with her hands, everything. A nice smile on her face and everything, delightful, funny. Not like this animal, Al. Death penalty. Shoot him. It should be quick and brutal. It's okay. It's okay. Okay? You got, you gotta go, Vic. What? You gotta go, 'cause if, I don't want trouble, okay? Please just, you gotta go. Please. I am not going anywhere, all right? You are coming home with me. No. What are you doing? I can't, 'cause he'll just come after me, Vic. You know him, please. I don't want any more trouble, please. I'm just scared. It'll all calm down. It'll be fine. How the fuck can you stay with him after this? I love him. I fucking love him. That's fucked. Love isn't supposed to hurt, Kat. But I love him, Vic. Was this about the guns? No, it wasn't about the guns. He was just jealous. - Kat? - What the fuck? It's Reilly. Don't let him in, please. Hey. Oh, fuck, Jesus Christ, you all right? Al. Holy fuck. All right, let's sit down. Let's just sit down. It's Al. It's Al. Fucking lowlife motherfucker! Hitting a woman. Reilly. How could he do something like that? Don't act so surprised. This isn't the first time. It's gonna be okay, baby. It's gonna be all right. What do you mean, okay? You're the one who went and cut off Jose. You're fucking one of them. No, I didn't. I didn't, I didn't do anything, okay? I don't work for Al, Kat. I don't. Clancy did that with some other guys, I promise you. Reilly, Reilly, Reilly. Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right I'll do anything you want, okay? It's your call. You're full of shit, Reilly. You guys are all full of shit. All right, I'm gonna get your stuff. And we're gonna get you outta here, 'cause you can't stay here anymore, okay? - I'll take you... - You come home with me, okay? That'll be better. I don't wanna go with anybody, shit! Stay here, and I'll wait with you, and I'll beat the fucking shit out of him when he comes home, right in front of you. Stay right there, stay right there. Honey, it's okay. Baby, I'm sorry. You shouldn't have done this, Al! Get the fuck outta my fucking house! Fuck you! Don't fucking touch her! No, you don't touch her! You don't deserve her, you motherfucker! Stop it, Reilly! Reilly, watch out! Stop it! Stop, Reilly get off him! Reilly, watch out! Reilly, get off of him! He has a fucking gun! Somebody call the police! You're hurting him, Reilly! You're hurting him, Reilly, stop it! Al! Al, are you okay? You're hurting him, Reilly! Get off! They were noisy. Very noisy. That's all I have to say. I don't wanna get into any trouble. What went on behind those closed doors is none of my business. Get them to let me see Al, okay? I'm here to help you, not Al. You think I believe that, huh? You think I'm fucking stupid? You don't think I know that you want me to help the cops put Al away for a long time and I'm not gonna fucking have anything to do with it. You got that? Look, I, I don't know what Al's done in the past, and honestly I don't care. I'm here because I was assigned to your case, to help you. This is my job, all right? I talk to battered women. Battered women? What the fuck does that mean, battered women? What is that? What, a fucking shake and bake or something? Fucking battered fucking chicken. What the fuck are you talking about? Come on, Kat. Look at you. He clearly hurt you. What? He threw me a beating, so what? I mean, I get a beating once, once in a blue moon. This wasn't just a beating. You gonna wait til the next time, until he actually kills you? He didn't mean it, okay? Listen to me. You can protect yourself, all right? Talk to me. Nothing you say is gonna leave this room. Yeah, right. The fucking walls have ears. I am not asking you to rat out your boyfriend. All right? All I'm asking you is how a man who loves a woman would do this to her? And why a woman like you would stay? You don't have to say anything if you don't want to. We can, uh, we can just sit here for awhile. He cut my hair. Oh Jesus Christ, look, it was a fucking accident, all right? I didn't try to kill her. It would've been murder if the bullet had hit her. Yeah, but it didn't. It grazed her, okay? It was an accident. I wouldn't kill Kat! She gives the best fucking head in New York. I can see you think quite highly of her. Okay, look. If somebody was trying to come after your man, right? You wouldn't wanna hurt her? No one is worth killing for. I guess you haven't had a taste of Kat. So, um, you married? Divorced. Lonely, huh? Not at all. My work keeps me very busy. Oh. You wanna fuck me, don't you? This may be hard for you to believe, but I can resist your charms. Okay. You would be the first. What about your girlfriend who's about to put you away? What would she say if you heard you talking like this? Please don't be so dramatic, okay? I'm not going anywhere except for home. Home sweet home, betcha. Kat's not pressing charges. She can't live without me, you see? She fucking loves me. So what do you think of me, huh? I think you're homicidal and psychopathic. And that if left on the streets, you'll probably kill someone. Maybe yourself. Don't you fucking say that, I'll fucking kill you! Clancy! What the fuck is wrong with you, moron? You're a tough guy? You're tougher than me? You think you're cute, Clancy, but I know you. All I said in the bar was she was talking to the fucking Puerto Rican. Fuck off, bitch! I know you're an asshole, all right? Coward scumbag motherfucker whose feet smell and Kat caught a beating because of what you fucking said! Bullshit! She deserves it. You can't trust her. You wanna watch what you say, Clancy. I'm telling you, mind your fucking business or you're gonna get hurt. Are you threatening me? Hey, Fuck you! You don't have anything to worry about from me! You got Kat, you got Reilly, you got the fucking spics! You think Jose's gonna drop you cutting him? Do ya? I'm telling you watch your back. You got a big fucking mouth and it's gonna get you killed! You're not scaring me, you know. I'm not? Well then, you're just fucking retarded! See you in the morgue, genius. Look, I don't plan to live here all my life, all right? I got dreams of getting out. You know, Al and I have big plans to maybe move into the beach or something. You know not, not this year, but hopefully next year. You like the beach? Yeah, I like the beach. I love the beach, okay? I love it. Al says he's gonna get us a place there, he promises me. Kat, you don't need Al to get that far. You'll be surprised at how much you can do all on your own. All right, we better stop here. Why? Because, okay? I don't want trouble, all right? I got neighbors, and they're gonna talk and stuff, okay? Give me a call, okay? Come on. You are trouble. This is stupid. Fucking shells! What the fuck? What the fuck was I fucking thinking? Fucking shells! Somebody should have killed Al a long time ago. I wanted to a lot of times, but I couldn't. You know, I knew him a long time and shit and it just wouldn't have been a good thing to do, you know? It's a neighborhood thing. We got rules. Sure, we had fights. Yeah. We saw things differently many a times. Most times. But it wouldn't have been cool. Hey, trouble. Hi. It's on the house. I, no, I can't accept stolen goods. You kidding me? I didn't steal it. Al stole it. Just take it, all right? I mean, come on, don't make me feel like shit, please? All right, all right. You wanna come in? Yeah. - Thank you. - Okay. I'll make you some toast. Okay. Now, listen to me. Al's gonna be a free man in 24 hours, so you have to make a decision. Press charges or get a court order. I mean, how do you know so much about Al? Because I was married to a man just like him. Wow. I wanna show you something. Jesus Christ. How long ago was that? It was, uh, 6 years. After I left him I went back to school, you know, I got my degree. You're crazy. My whole life changed for the better. It did, and leaving him was the best thing I ever did. I'm scared. You can do that. You can do that too. You weren't scared, though? You weren't scared he was gonna come back and come after you? You know, I couldn't afford to be scared anymore. Hey, Sarge. Hey, Reilly. Hey. You hear anything yet? No, and you? No. Beer. Yeah. There you go. ♪ All that ♪ You said ♪ Were lies I wanna kill him. ♪ I believed I'll kill the motherfucker. ♪ Wasting my love on you Reilly, that's probably the smartest thing you've ever said. This is it. I mean, it's not like where I live. We need to find you a place to live. I could stay at my friend Vic's house, but uh, I don't think that's a very good idea. Why not? Because I'll start off on her couch and end up on her bed. You know what I'm saying? What? Does that freak you out, that I slept with a girl? - No, no. - Excuse me. No, why? No, no. Live and let live, I always say. Yeah, live and let live. That's what I always say too, you know. Live and let live. You are so uptight. No. You gotta loosen up. Come on. Anyway, besides. It's not far enough. It's down the block, I mean, I'm probably gonna, you know, end up finding a hotel downtown or something, you know. You could stay with me. I couldn't ask you to do that. No, ah, no, it's no trouble, at all. I have the room. I'll think about it, thanks. Listen to me. You are a woman and you have power and you need to use it. Lips, tits, hips. All woman. You know, you gotta think about it that way. Use your power as a woman to change your life. Have you slept with a woman? No, no, uh. Are you coming on to me? Maybe. Do you want me to? I mean, come on. That's what this is all about, right? Help. No, no, that is not why I'm here helping you. And contrary to what you might believe, not everybody wants something from you. I'm here doing my job. I'm not here to take advantage of you. I promise you that. I promise. Well, thank you. But I don't believe a word you're telling me, okay? Nobody does something for nothing. When I was 9 years old, he told me he wished I'd never been born. He said he'd never fucking wanted kids. But he was always so fucking horny, he just had this incredible sex drive, so he couldn't keep his hands off my mother. I told him, "That's no excuse." "If you don't want kids, don't fucking have 'em." I mean, there's too fucking many unwanted kids out there, right? Just turn the bitch over and fuck her in the ass. That's my solution for birth control, overpopulation. Turn the fucking bitch right over and fuck her in the ass. Hey, how you doing? - Al. - Come here. I'm gonna yell for Vic and Liz, they're downstairs. They're gonna call the cops. No you won't. Al, you're not supposed to be here, okay? Don't make this harder for me than it already is. I don't want that fucking bitch coming around here investigating us, okay? No! I'm fucking warning you, okay? I don't want her coming around here. I'm fucking warning you. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Okay. Come here. Well, she has never had any luck with men, but, I mean, she just doesn't know how to keep a man. Never has. Like me, my fourth husband and I, we have been happily married for two years. It just works. Gertie, will you shut your fat mouth and cook me something? Just shut your fat yap, you fat fuck! We're gonna eat when I'm goddamned good and ready, okay? Look, I do not know where she got her problem with men from, okay? Maybe it was from her father. I mean, he is crazy. Shit, Clancy says he saw you talking with the Puerto Rican motherfucker again. I didn't talk to him, all right? Did you wanna suck his cock? No, I didn't suck his fucking cock! Then why not fucking answer me when I fucking ask you a question? Why'd it take you so long to think about it? You have to fucking think about it? No, I didn't have to fucking think about it! Jesus fucking Christ, you're making me goddamn fucking nervous, all right? All right. I feel like I'm on fucking jeopardy! Fuck! Are you gonna leave at the first sign of a domestic disturbance? Al. Oh Al, oh Al. No, no Al. What? Insanity is not a fucking domestic disturbance, Al! It's a disease. It's a rot. And you're nuts. Okay. Let me go, please, just just let me go, please. Okay, I promise I'm not gonna hit you anymore, okay? You said that the last time. This time I mean it, all right? No, no, I need some time, Al. This time I mean it. I need some time to think about things, okay? Don't leave me. To see if I can forgive you for fuck's sake! All right, cut the fucking shit! Cut the fucking shit! You're not going anywhere, okay? Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Don't you fucking tell me what I can do to you. I own you. You don't have a fucking inch of me that's yours, okay? I fucking own you, okay? - Al. - Yeah? I'm filing a court order of protection against you, Al. - It's within my rights. - Yeah. - I have... - You got fucking dick! You don't have any power! I got the fucking power! You're a fucking woman. I'll cut your fucking face up into a million pieces if you put the fucking court order. You won't be able to get within 50 feet of me, Al. I won't have to. I'll have somebody else do it. I'll be sitting right here watching the TV, okay? When you're getting your face all torn off, I'll have three fucking witnesses. Police, my fucking friends. And when you're getting your face all cut up, well, I'll be right here, you won't have any fucking proof, okay? So, you'll be so fucking ugly when you come crawling back to me I won't even fucking want you anymore. Hey Kat, what's going on? - Sit down. - Let's go. Sit the fuck down. Kat, are you okay? What the fuck is he doing here? Tell her to put the bag down, Kat. Tell her. Vic. She's staying with me. Listen to me, Kat. Remember what we talked about. I can call the police right now if you want me to. Tell her you're staying. Tell her you're staying. - It'll be okay. - Yeah. Tell 'em to get the fuck out of the house, go on. Guys, just please can you fucking please go 'cause I'm, we're gonna work this out. I don't want any fucking trouble, okay, please? - Kat. - Okay? You listen to me, Albert. You hurt her, I'm not your scared little girlfriend. I'll fucking end you. Yeah, I ain't fucking scared, okay? You should be. Fucking nigger. Get the fuck out of my house so I can fuck my little piece of pussy. Call me any name you want to. You hit her again, it's gonna be you and me. You understand me? Kat? Please, guys, just please go. Please go. It's gonna be okay. It's a private matter between us. Fuck you! Don't fucking make me get up. I got married when I was 18, to a guy who I thought was Prince Charming. But it was a frog, right? - Right. - Yeah. He had me fooled for awhile though, God. I was crazy about the guy. You were young. Maybe you were just crazy. Or drunk. Probably both. It was great, it was great at the beginning, you know? Great. But then, well, he started drinking and acting just like Al. I was six months pregnant. With a girl. Tess. He had come home late one night. I don't know, he was drunk and we started fighting about his drinking, or everything, or nothing. And he started hitting me, and he just would not stop. Somehow, I got away and I, I ran into the hallway screaming and neighbors called the police again, and I got to the top of the stairs and he caught up with me. He hit me so hard I fell down the stairs and, uh... I lost the baby. I'm sorry. Yeah. You know, I didn't even go home for my clothes or any of my stuff. Wouldn't let him come see me at the hospital. I was so mad. Men are dogs. One day we're gonna wake up, they are gonna start barking. Right. Anyway, I really would like to help Kat, so, um, if you think of something. Anything. Yeah? Let me know, all right? I will. You're fucking me. You're fucking only me. Can you hear me? You fucking, fucking whore! Fucking whore! Why don't you say my fucking name? Al Say it! Ow! Al! Ow! What are you suggesting? Well, if Kat isn't strong enough to leave Al, maybe Al needs to leave Kat. Yeah, he's, uh, he's never gonna do that. Maybe not voluntarily. What are you saying? You look like you play by the rules and my suggestion is a little bit risky. Well, without risk, there's no reward. You're filthy, I love it. Come on, go ahead. I'm talking a friend of mine into knocking Al off and he'll do it for a price. Okay, um, wait a minute, wait a minute. This um, this conversation never happened. What? He's not that expensive. We can chip in. Chip in? This isn't a fucking dinner. You're talking about a murder. Are you insane? That is the only way we can get her away from him so that she can be with me. Ah. You're in love with her? I'd do anything for her. I'm crazy about her. Or maybe you're just crazy. Do you realize you're talking about a murder? You said "no risk, no reward". I read that in a fucking book or something, okay? I wasn't talking about killing someone. God! You met me two hours ago and you want me to be an accomplice to murder. Not anymore. You, you people in this neighborhood, you think you're above the law, but you're not. This isn't the Wild West. That's what you think. Fuck you! Let me see Al! I don't think you understand something, all right? I'm not rolling over on him. You got that? You like that? It's all right. So I thought you were gonna take care of this little problem of ours. What happened? Backfire on you? I thought you were gonna take care of it. I'll be right back. I'm working on it. I like you. I like you, too. For a guy. You know, Big Al was the leading cause of death in the neighborhood for a while. So you're saying a lot of people would want him dead? I'm saying this is a very dangerous neighborhood we live in. One has to be careful. That's exactly what I was thinking. Just don't let me hear that you've been talking to Reilly, okay? Or Vic. I was gonna say that I love you. Okay. Don't worry, I won't talk to them. All right, or there'll be trouble, okay? Okay. Gimme a kiss. Right. We've got two hours. We've got two hours. Oh yeah? Well, that's all I need. God, I wish I'd have saved all my first times for you. Really? I wish I was a virgin for you, Reilly. Fuck. Hey. What? I'd do anything to get away from him. I'd do anything to get rid of him. Anything? Yeah, you know that, right? I promise you, you come with me, I'll take care of you, baby, forever. You promise me? I wish I'd have saved all my first times for you, Vic. God, I wish I was a virgin for you, Vic. Fuck! Why? I can't take it, Vic. Every time he fucking touches me, all I can think about is you, Vic. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore, Vic. Kat knew exactly what she was doing. And she was a smart one. She liked the numbers. You know, gambling, taking the risks, playing the odds. If she wanted something for Christmas, she would tell four different people to get her the exact same thing 'cause she figured one of them would come through for her. And she was right. You're the best sex I ever had. Will you get me I want? She played everybody like a fucking fiddle. Hey. Hey. Hey. Aren't you glad that everything's back to normal? - Yeah. - Getting back, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah. You're always right, Al. You're always right. What's that? Huh? What? I love you, okay? I love you, too. Listen, I want to take you to the, uh, I don't wanna come back here after dinner, I wanna go out to some fancy place, you know? Take you out. No, what do you mean? Wait, but you were gonna stay here and cook dinner and make... No, no, no, no, no. I wanna take you to a fancy French restaurant, you know the one with the snails and shit. Hey, Al. Hey, Al Where's my coat? You know, I got this new, got this new prison fantasy I've been working on. Yeah. And I really, uh, wanted to try it out on you. - Yeah. - Would you like that? Yeah, I guess so. Not as much as I would. Okay, I'd like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. Where's my coat? Well don't wear the, uh... The Big Al coat, where is it? Don't wear the Big Al coat, I got you a new coat. Where is your new coat? I want the Big Al coat. Why? I got you, there it is, I got you a beautiful new coat. Come on, baby. For me? Okay. Al's problem is he never thought big. He was strictly small time. But he met his match when he met Kat. Oh, I'm tellin' ya. That's a smart cookie. Yeah. Tough! There was a period in her life when every guy she went out with changed his name to plaintiff in the first three weeks. Am I right? I really wanna change this time, Father. I'm just so sick and tired of being mean to my girl. I just, I wanna be, I wanna be a good man, you know? But I'm telling you. I just have this problem keeping it in my pants even when I'm in church praying every time I see a pretty girl walk up the aisle I just wanna crawl up underneath her skirt and... And what do you do? Well, I go back to praying, you know? It's good that you're trying. How do you think I feel? What are you sayin'? I have a line of women who stand in front of me, and get on their knees, and open their mouth, and stick out their tongue and look up at me and go "Ah". What do you do? I go back to praying. That's fucked up. How can you say this? How can you think like this? These poor girls are coming to you for hope and you want them to suck your cock. You fucking disgust me. I'm just a man, Al, with a collar and a cock. Oh, you're gonna burn in hell. I'm no better than you, no worse. You. You're weak. I fucking hate weakness! You! You disappoint me, man! Stay away from the kids, okay? - That's him! - Hands up, pal. Right there! - Get him! - Get your fucking hands up! Get him! Get your fucking hands up! Fuck you! What the fuck are you doing, Al! Fuck you, motherfucker! Stay there, man! What the fuck you doing out here now? You're under arrest for the murder of Clancy O'Hara. That's right, you prick! Don't you move! You're not goin' nowhere. Fuck you! I didn't fucking do it! It's a fuckin' mistake! Hey! Fuck off me! Get the fuck off me! Get in there! Come on. Go! You're not fucking going nowhere! Fuck you! Get in the fucking car! Come on, watch your fucking head. Fuck you! Al, he should've done something with his life. I mean, he was always in trouble. So I figured, "If you're always gonna be in trouble", "then you do something to make your mom proud of ya!" You rob a bank, you rob a gas station, you know, something to write home about. You want people to respect ya? Then you gotta do something to make 'em respect ya. Who cares if they fucking like ya? Now, if they fear ya, then that's something. Make the headlines, am I right? I can't believe we finally got rid of him. No one can connect you to this, right? You're dangerous, huh? You know I like that. Never know what you're gonna do. There's nothing sexier than being afraid. God. If I knew I was gonna meet you, I would've saved all my first times for you. You're the best sex I ever had. Let me find a way to pay you back. Kat, oh no, she's a doll. A real cunt. And I mean that in the nicest possible way. You hear anything on the street? No, nobody heard a thing. I want you to talk to Clancy's mother, okay? Find out who was after him. Reilly doesn't know anything, hm? Why don't you tell him to get his ass in gear. I need to get the fuck out of here right now. What are you so worried about? They don't have any evidence. Kat, they got my fingerprints all over the fucking gun, all right? How? I don't know. My lawyer says the good thing is that I got proof that I wasn't anywhere near Clancy's house that night, right? I got you. But I just don't get it, because the guy who lives downstairs, he says he sees me running out the fucking building at 10:45 right after he hears the gunshot. He said he knows it's me because he sees the Big Al jacket, right? But I lost that fucking jacket, what? Weeks ago. Anybody could be fucking wearing that thing. I don't fucking get it. You follow me? Was Clancy killed with the gun I sold? No, no. He was killed with the fucking .45 that's registered in my name. I don't understand. Somebody's fucking with me, okay? Who? I don't know. Somebody who knows us. Are you accusing me? No, I don't know I mean, I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. The good thing is I got you as my proof, okay? You're my alibi. What proof, Al? Where were you that night? What do you mean? Where were you that night? Well, I was with you. We were at home, sitting there, playing cards, watching TV, remember? You didn't wanna go out that night. We came back after the movie. I made fucking baked beans with toast and a tuna melt for me. What? I don't remember. All right, don't fucking, just don't fucking play games with me, Kat. You're my fucking alibi here. I'm getting all mixed up with the dates. I was with you. No. I was with a friend. And he would swear on a stack of Bibles. He's a very religious man. You wouldn't do this to me, Kat. Betcha? Betcha? It's not too fucking late for us. Please. Just please. Don't beg. You... You pussy. I'll fucking kill you. I'll fucking kill you you fucking cunt! Sit the fuck down like the dog you are, sit down. You'll be fucking sorry. You listen to me, because I'm in control now. And the way I look at it is: Hips, lips, tits. A whole woman. What are you talking about? What the fuck? Who the fuck have you been talking to right now? I want you to listen to me, Al. I'll kill you. Listen to me, good. I'll fuckin' kill you, baby. Al, you're making me very angry and you don't want that. Because I have the power. And you will rot in this motherfucker if I want you to. Do you understand me, Al? Do you? You set me up, right? You set me up. Don't be so dramatic. You and Vic, right, okay. You and Vic, fuck. Right? Wrong. Wrong. Not you and Reilly. You didn't... Tell me you didn't fuck him, okay? Just tell me you didn't. Tell me he didn't fucking ask you to suck his fucking cock! He didn't have to, Al. I volunteered. Oh, Kat. - You wouldn't do this to me. - Al. Yeah? Thanks for the haircut. It's a whole new me. So how'd you do it? What? Set up Al? I didn't. Come on. I know you were in on it with Kat. I wasn't. Have you, uh, slept with her recently? No, have you? Nah. Bitch. But you still want her bad, though, don't you? To tell the truth she's too much trouble. After all this, I could never trust her. I'd be looking behind my back the whole time. She scares me. I think I should be with somebody more like you. Really? Yeah. I don't think I've ever talked to a woman as much as I have with you and it not end up in bed. You know? If you're lucky, Reilly, you might have a lot of first times with me. This isn't a game, is it? I don't play games. I play pool. This could be a whole new approach. Becoming friends first and then, you know, fuckin'. You got some nice legs, Vic? Yeah, you like those? Yeah, I do. I really do. You play your cards right, they can be wrapped around your back in 10 minutes. What would I have to do? Don't say a word. I'm mute. Right there. What was that about? What? Oh, look, you didn't cure me. I'm not sick. I'll always swing both ways, and I got a soft spot for redheads. So do I. Come here. How was that? It was all right. Let's get outta here. Okay. Hey. So, you wanna get your stuff? And take it over to my place? No. No? Uh, what do you mean? No. I thought that with Al out of the way, that we would be together. Did I say that? You didn't have to say that. Your body said that. Okay. I get it, I get it. You got what you wanted and now you're gonna play me. So, who is it? Is it Vic, is it Reilly? No, no, it's not like that, okay? It's none of them. I need to be alone, you understand? So, after all of the, everything I did for you all I get is a kiss? What, what happened to you? What about all that shit? Hips, tits, lips, all woman? Power? Use it? You stop it! You do not throw my fucking words back in my face! You used me! I didn't take anything from you, okay? You told me I could trust you, that you didn't need anything from me and in the end, you treated me just like everybody else, all right? You got what you needed. You took from me. So don't play the victim, hm? Fuck you! Fuck you! You don't have to fucking throw people away like this! You don't do this! Hey, Jeff, can I get a hot dog? Hey, what's up with the ketchup? Big Al was a great fuck. I mean, it was great until it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, when we first started going out, it was exciting, you know, dangerous. He was funny, sexy, wild, made me feel safe, protected. But he couldn't protect me from himself. Big Al could've gotten me almost anything in the world, but almost isn't good enough. You know, life is like sex. If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself. Going out with Big Al made me realize that the best feeling in the world is taking care of number one.
