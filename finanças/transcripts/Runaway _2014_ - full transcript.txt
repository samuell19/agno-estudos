You were busy with the stock, Dad, you were Ansos. - Ansos, what is that? - Anti-social. I'm not anti-social. I am working, Son. We'll meet at the front alley. We'll meet at the same place, Tala. Okay? Sorry, sir, there are many stressed people here. - Just like in Jakarta. - What was your name? - Widodo, originally from Solo, Dad. - Yes, sir, my name is Widodo. Mr. Smith calls me Naga. It means dragon, sir, in order to bring me luck. Here it is! Not enough? Here. No! I'm confused! Let alone paying the hospital for Mom, my debt will never paid off with only this much everyday. Easy, I'll help you. What will you do? Gamble again? Gambling is an effort, Tala. If we have win, the money could multiply. - And if our money... - You never win! I was just unlucky. But they said this week my star will shine. You promised Mom that you would never gamble again. I didn't. I just told you about the zodiac forecast this week. You lie! Don't judge me. How do you know that? Your eyes are lying. I know them very well! Come on, just go home. - Come on, Son, let's go inside. - When will we go home, Dad? We just arrived, and you already want to go home. How come? I'm bored already. Don't be like a kid, you're an adult now. Come on. Speak Indonesian, sir. - 10 a.m., sir. - 10 a.m. we have to meet people, okay? - Where are you going, Musa! - Learn to be an adult, Dad. - You take care of him, go! - Okay, sir. Mom. - You just came, Tala? - Yes. Mom, I brought dim sum for you. Why are you so late? Were there many guests at the restaurant? Yes Mom, the restaurant was very crowded. Finally, the manager told me to work late. Poor you, Tala. You have to work so very hard for me. It's for me too, Mom. Let's eat now, the food will get cold. Your uncle isn't home yet. Leave some food for him. We don't need to wait for him, Mom. I'm sure Tony has eaten outside. You are disrespectful. Tony is my brother. But you just call him by his name. He himself asked me to do that, so that there is no distance. I'm sure he will feel shame if I call him uncle. People would know how old he was. This is your favorite, Mom. Have a nice meal. Why, Mom? Do you feel pain in your chest again? Did you already take the medicine? You should take this medicine regularly. Bear's Heart is good for your illness. You will recover if you take this medicine. Drink it, please. Here. Tala. I want to go home. Did you forget, Mom, we're illegals here. You shouldn't need to catch up with me here. Your life has become hard now. No need to worry, Mom. I'm a strong woman. And the most important thing is I can be with you here. I have told you many times on the phone. There is Tony who taking care of me here. - But you didn't believe me. - How can I trust Tony, Mom? You don't remember that his job was only gambling in Indonesia? That was the past, Tala. He has changed now. Even though I know it is difficult to change a habit. I saw he works seriously in the port now. He earns a decent income. What's up, Tala? Anything that I don't know about? His job is legit, right? Yeah, it's legit, Mom. How much do you want to borrow? No, brother. I have a lot of debt. Brother, Felix Chiang is coming here. They want to collect the debt of... Oh, my God. Are you okay, Musa? What have you done? He could be killed, and we do nothing? They are gangsters, mobsters, they can kill anyone. You want to be killed? - Yes, but... - There is no "but." Come on! This is Hong Kong, not Indonesia, Musa. You see, Son, the sun has risen. Don't waste our time. You are so very difficult to give advice to. I told you, no more betting, no more gambling, but you keep doing it! And this is all you got. You fool. I was stupid. You are looking for trouble, you know? Felix Chiang won't keep quiet about you taking his money. And he will be looking for you. Please don't tell Mother about this. Why aren't you with my Dad right now? One of my main tasks is to accompany my boss's son. Where are you going now? Please just say it. - Dono, Indro? - I am hungry. Hungry. Okay. Here is the Central Pear, Musa. Hong Kong's landmark. You can see from here. The transportation is one of the places for money circulation. Look. The buildings are soaring high. The rotation of the money is the reason your dad invested in Hong Kong. Musa, this is not halal meat. We should look for something else. But the burgers are cute. Please take a picture. Ready. - What's up? - My wallet. - Your wallet? - Go, run! My wallet is lost! - Indonesian? - Who? Musa Pahlevi. - Musa who? - The guy who chased me. What do you want to do with it? Don't. I haven't checked yet. He lives in a luxury hotel, Uncle. Yes. But after graduating middle school... Right, Dad? Are you okay? Here's your drink. I have to go to toilet, Dad. Where is it? Here. Only this? No way, Tala. Obviously he's a rich kid. I'm not a thief! Thief, pickpocket, robber, they are all the same! Give me! You're so noisy! Be quiet! Can't you see my other shoe is lost? - Musa, what are we doing here? - Looking the owner of this shoe? Shoe? Do you know her? - The hamburger one yesterday. - Hamburger? You mean, the thief? - Why the do you have the shoe? - It's a long story. Musa, your Dad is meeting Mr. Smith. Aren't you coming? Tell him that I got lost on the way. Lost on the way? If you meet the hamburger, what will you do? Kiss her! With this? What? With your lips? Wow, it's still warm. - Delicious? - You want to try it? How did you know I was here? Sorry, I can't. I have business to take care of. Who are you looking for? Everyone knows that you were at my place last night, and you brought my bag! Now you can regret and enjoy this cigar! Next time, if you don't return my money, you will suck your own finger! Do you understand? You're so spoiled! Small wounds, you scream as if you have been stabbed. Don't talk like that, Tala! He was injured because he was buying medicine for me and he fell from the escalator. - I'll make you a breakfast. - Fine, sister. Thank you. Those injuries aren't caused by falling from an escalator. It hurts! What happened? Boss Felix, right? Be careful when you're talking about him! Why? What did he want? He just wants his money back. But how? Mom? - Mom. - You... You make breakfast for Tony. What's up, Tala? Tony, besides picking pocket and gambling, is there any other way to get more money faster? What are we doing here? You said you wanted the fastest way. This is all I know. - I mean, other than gambling! - What is your chosen horse number? - Number 4. - Four, right? Okay. Why are we gambling? This is not gambling, this is sports. Dad. - I want to get a closer look. - Jeanie will accompany you. - Yes, I'm coming with you. - No, I can go alone. Musa. - Musa! - What's the number now? I don't know! Tala! We always won, Tala! That's enough, Tony, we've won many times. It's not enough, Tala! We'll bet again on all of them. If we win, the problem with Mr. Felix Chia will be solved! Then all your debts are paid off. Most importantly, Mom can get treatment. The problem is I'm not sure about my choice. Tala, you will win. Let's go! - No! I don't want it! - Come on! Tala! - Tala. - Bet all that we have. We will win, Tala! Tala! Tala! Tala! Tala! Tala! Why are you following me? - I don't know you. - Then why did you run? - That's my business, if I run or not! - Hamburger. I know how you got my wallet and passport, Tala. You're that hamburger, right? If I am, then what? I gave your wallet and passport back. - So our business is over. - Not yet. Our business is not finished. - You have to make up for your mistake. - Report to the police? - That's not what I want. - Then what? You want me to pay with money? It's useless, I have no money! Accompany me while I'm here, I'm bored. Me accompany you? - Why should I? - With you it will be more exciting. I just have to give you company? Nothing more, right? If you try to do more than that, I'll beat you up! Understand? Tony, where is my money? - I'll talk to you later! - You lost? Damn you! Give me back my money, Tony! - Tala. It's enough. Stop it. - You shut up! Don't interfere! Who are you? Who is he? I am Musa. Oh, he is your guy, right? It's really difficult to give you any advice. Don't gamble anymore! Stay here. This is a family matter! Tala. Tala, I have a new idea. Money. No, I don't wanna hear your new idea! Listen to me. Musa likes you. You're lucky. He's a rich kid. Don't waste it. - You can ask for anything. - Shut up, Tony! You have to be patient with a girl. Especially with Tala. You like her, right? You like her! If you like her, go get her now. I am her uncle, I know her character exactly. She is bitchy, but if you seduce her, she will be a gentle one. So if you can make her happy, she will definitely like you back. Do you get it? Got it. But remember... her uncle. Go get her now. Go! And you... Don't follow me around. - What have I done? - I'm angry now! Why are you angry? Because your uncle lost the bet? Because life is not fair. Life is easy for people like you. You can get anything you want. But for me... Musa, just leave me alone. - This is not the deal. - What deal? Accompany me while I'm in Hong Kong. The deal is cancelled. - Why? - Because I'm not a tour guide. I don't need that, I just need a friend. I'm an impatient person, you can't stand it. How about we try it first? - I want payment then. - Deal. - I will decide where we are going. - Deal. - I will eat anything you eat. - Deal. - And what you buy, I will buy too. - Deal. - And I decide it how much you pay me! - Deal. - Let's go. - I will follow you. - Your mother didn't come with you? - My mother has passed away. I'm sorry. Illness? Road accident. I was the driver. That night, my father was to drive the vehicle. As usual. He is always busy with his work. So I had to replace him. Until now, we still haven't been able to get rid of our guilt. You blame your father and your father blames you. So, when will it end? Well, it's all over. You don't need to look for the fault. That won't bring back your mother, right? At first, I thought your life was the most perfect. You are handsome. Born into a rich family. You could get anything you want. What else is lacking? But everybody has their own problems, Tala. And we all think that our problem is the hardest one in this world. What are your problems? Not too much. My father remarried in Indonesia. My mom suffered a lung problem but I didn't have money for her treatment. And I have an uncle who loved gambling, he had a lot of debt. And the three of us are trapped in this country. Can I help you, Tala? No need. I'm sharing this because you shared yours. Not because I ask to be pitied by you. Let's go home. Just like our deal. Here. Yes, just like our deal. Well, what time is it tomorrow? What do you mean? Tomorrow I am still in here. So our deal is not expired yet, right? - Where do you want to go? - You choose the place. Do you want to... Just like our deal, everything I buy, you buy. See you tomorrow then. Damn shoes! I want to return something you have left in my room. It's useless, Musa, I already threw it away the other one. Here's the other one. - But how? - I am the one who looking for it. Here, use it. - May I? - Yes, sure. It fits. - Is it good? - Good. - Thank you, Musa. - You are very welcome, Tala. I told you, don't mess with me. - Sorry. I was thinking... - What were you thinking? I was that easy? Son. Where have you been all day? Strolling around, enjoying Hongkong. Just like you want, Dad. Become an adult. Anything wrong? So you left Jeanie just like that? No, she is with her dad. You didn't say a word? Why should I? She is no one to me. Musa. You know what I mean, right? No. I never understand what you want, Dad. Sorry, Dad, I am sleepy. How was the date? Was it cool? What do you mean? What did he buy you? You have to share with me, if you get a fortune. You better shut up, Tony. Tala. I am serious. You know that I need money for Mr. Felix Chiang. When did that become my business? Please, help your uncle. Borrow the money from Musa. If you borrow it from him, he will give it. Yeah, you can show some love, give him a hug, and a little kiss maybe. Enough! Go away! You are so annoying! Wait a little bit longer. Wait and wait again. There she is! It's not her that I want. I mean the hamburger. Hambabau. She is a Hambabau too, Musa. Nice Hambabau. - Where are you going? - I was going to go to... How about you come with me today? So we can go to Macau. - You've never been to Macau, right? - Right! Sorry, Jeanie, I can't go with you today. - And then? - You go with Jeanie, okay? - Musa! - Musa! Tala! I thought you wouldn't come today. I shouldn't have come. But these shoes brought me here. Oh, her. I can explain, Tala. You are too much! - I'm sorry, Sis. - What kind of person are you? How dare you teach the wrong thing to Tala? - It's all what she wants, Sis. - Shut up! Tala is my daughter! I know her exactly! And I know you really well! From the beginning until now, you just gave me trouble! I'm sorry, Sis. I'll give it up. You gave it up, you said! How are you going to repay your debt? I'm also confused, Sis. You can only be confused. Damn you! Sis. Take it. But, this is - the money you saved for your treatment. - Useless! This money is illegal money! I will never be healed! Take it! No, Sis. Take it! Sis! - So, who was that girl? - Should you ask that now? - Surely she is rich. - Yes. She is very rich. You two seem to be a good match. - But our hearts are not match. - Really? - In my opinion... - Tala, please. Can you stay silent for a while? The world feels calm if you are silent. I will not make a sound. He is a good match if he's there. What do you want to say? Do you want to protest? Musa, you are really tacky. - Still not enough, boss. - It is still not enough, Tony. I know, boss. Please give me more time. I promise, I'll pay it off. I know how to get that money back, boss. You make too many promises, Tony. I swear, Boss. But I need help to carry out this plan, boss, please. Do you think that I will believe in your words easily, Tony? All the 20 million dollars is for you, boss. This is your last chance! - Mom, this is Musa. - Good evening, ma'am. Where are these things coming from? Musa asked me to go shopping. I also bought something for you, Mom. Take them home, son. We do not deserve to receive them. Don't get me wrong, ma'am. I sincerely bought all this for Tala. For what reason? What Tala did for you that you are willing to buy all these things for Tala? - Take them to your home. - But Mom... Take them to your home, son. Please! Please wait for me outside. I will excuse myself, ma'am. Mom, Musa has no intentions at all. He is sincere. Stop insulting yourself, Tala. I don't understand your meaning here? I know what your plan for Musa is. You just want to use him, right? So he'll pay for Tony's debt and my medical expenses! - Am I, right? - But that was Tony's plan, Mom, not me. But finally, you gave in, and you did it! It was the same when you decided to quit your job and preferred to be a pickpocket on the street! Tala. We are indeed poor and didn't have anything, but that is not a reason for you to do this shameful thing. Please pick up the phone, Musa. Please, pick up the phone. Musa. I heard everything. No, Musa, what you heard is not true. I didn't intend to use you. - And all that is Tony's idea. - Tala. I believe you. Musa! - How are you? - I'm fine. What's up, Tony? No. I just need you. Let's talk. - Okay, but... - Musa! I was looking for you everywhere. Where did you go to? - Come here for a minute. - Sorry, lady. - Sorry, but I am... - You shut up! This is not your business. Talk to you later, Tony. What else do you want? Where have you been? You were just going this morning, why? Here's the thing. I want to know you more. ...you, me, your dad, my dad, the four of us go to dinner? And if you want your female friend could join us. Okay then. - You look different. - You ask me for it. Remember, they don't have to know the real you. - Yeah, don't worry. - Musa. How come you never told me that you have a friend in Hong Kong? I think I've seen her before. - I don't know where. - No. Maybe a familiar face. You lived in Hong Kong for a long time? I am... Moved here, two years ago. After graduating, I moved to Hong Kong with my family. Since then we never met again, right, Musa? Do you study here too? What is your major? - Fashion design. - Architect. Architect? - Yeah, architect. - Let me explain. Well, I take two majors, so the first one is home design - and the other one is fashion design. - You are great. - Where? - At Hongkong University. Tala, let me help you. I'm fine, Musa. Excuse me for a moment. - I will help her, okay? - Yes. Who are you really? What do you mean? I know you are lying. What do you know about me? Like most Indonesians who came and lived here, you are a restaurant waiter. Your Mom is a migrant worker, and your Dad, a construction worker maybe. You are amazing. You better than me. You are so very easy to deceive people. What would Musa's dad think, if he finally found out that his Son was dating a con artist. He doesn't need to know if you keep quiet! Yes! I'll keep my mouth shut. I won't tell anyone. But I want to know... how does it feel to be a coward? - Mr. Surya. - Yes. - Forgive my attitude earlier. - Tala, what are you talking about? I have not been honest with you. What do you mean? I stole Musa's passport. Really? I am a pickpocket, sir. My mother was a migrant worker. And my uncle is an alcoholic gambler. And me... I am stupid, sir. I didn't know why I wanted to be invited here and tell lies like that. And I just want to say thank you. And once again, I'm sorry. Please excuse me. - Tala. - Musa, don't! Come sit now. Sit! Sit! I said, sit! This is not Musa's fault. Indeed there are many girls like Tala who... - I know girls like them. - No. Tala is not like them. - What do you want to say? - She isn't like them! Musa, listen to me first! Tala! Please listen to me, Tala. Forgive me. I know I was wrong. - I should've not lied like that. - No, Musa. You are not wrong. I am the one who is the fool. I can't see the difference between reality and a dream. This is real. Everything is real. All the things I felt. No, Musa. What happened earlier, that is the real truth! Now, later, and until whenever, it won't change. Our worlds are different. Our ways are different, all is different. Tala, there is love that unites all of it. And the lies, Musa. That is real. My mom was right, we can't ignore this. Because one day, someone will be hurt in the end. I'm returning this back to you. Tala. Tala. Tala! Tala! Let me go! Tala! Let me go! So here is the daughter of the tycoon? - How much ransom are we asking? - Five million dollars. What is her name? - Jeanie, boss. - Open it. I want to see her. Jeanie. Come on, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Who are you people? Let me go! We just want to ask money from your father. You guys got the wrong person, I am not... Sorry, boss, I was wrong. Now, call her dad and tell him his daughter is with us and tell him the ransom is five million dollars! I am Surya. - Please sit down, ma'am. - Musa's father. What do you want to talk about? You see, ma'am, as parents, we do have difficulties managing our children as per our expectations. Especially about love, right? Love. Tala! - Tony, help me. Let me go, Tony. - I can't, Tala! Why? You are with them? The important thing is, as a parents, we have to give a provision for our children. Just let them find their provision by themself. For their future life. The wrong provision? We can learn from mistakes, right? You don't know Musa. Maybe you don't know Musa yourself. Just like you know Tala, you mean? Listen to me. They have taken the wrong person. They should've kidnapped Jeanie. What's important now is, you have to pretend as Jeanie, okay? Don't let Mr. Felix Chiang know that they took the wrong person. Otherwise we both die! You got that? Easy, ma'am. Tala doesn't have to be chasing Musa so hard. You need this, ma'am. Please excuse me. Sir, you've been young, right? - Haven't you fallen in love? - Love. If indeed you had, you would never consider things like this simple and can be fixed by this. Now, please excuse me. The wind is strong in this place. - Not good for my health. Here it is, sir. - It's already rightfully yours. Please. - What if we call him later, after... - Don't mess with me, Tony. - Don't mess with me, Tony! - You can call my Dad's other number. - If you do that, I'll shoot your leg! - What is the number, Jeanie? - Hurry up! - 852-12-565. Tala. - Musa? - Dad. - Dad, please help me. - What's going on? One thing that makes me give you this money is because I don't want to lose the one I love anymore. I was told to bring the ransom. Here's the money! The rest will follow once I have met your hostage! Tony. Quick, throw the bag! Tony! Jeanie! - Don't mess with the gun, Jeanie. - I'm not Jeanie. I am Tala! Musa. Stop! Tala! Musa. Musa, are you okay? Musa. Musa, what are you doing? - I brought this for you. - No. Stop it. I don't need this. Musa. Musa! - I need you. - I... I can't. Seriously, Tala. Can you see me? You are fine. You can do this, okay? I... I apologize, Tala. I am the one who has to apologize to you, Musa. I... I... Musa. Yes, me too. Me too, Musa. Musa. Musa! Musa! Musa, you are right. That the fact is what we feel at the moment. Pain, fear. But I don't want to hide anymore. No more compulsion. Because the choices are always there. Thank you, Musa. I have chosen my path. Whatever happens, I promise you, I will not run again. Tala. It's time to go home. Tala. I... Let's go home, Mom. Tony.
