[EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD NOISE] [TROLLEY APPROACHING] [CROWD NOISE] Sir, there's the body you asked for. Why is it so small? It's the only one in the morgue. Let's make it a thousand. Deal? - Call. - Call? Call. [PLACING CHIP] [CROWD TALKING] Take it. That's expensive Japanese gold. It's in good quality. Take it now so that I'll be able to get back some of my money. Hi, grandma. What took you so long? Sorry grandma, traffic. Okay. Let's go. It's already okay. I'm sorry, Solomon. I lost. Bye. [CAR APPROACHING] [GATE CLOSING] Hi, auntie! Good evening. Hi. We'll go ahead. - Okay, bye. - It's still early. I have work tomorrow. - Okay. - I may have difficulty going home. Okay. Thanks for coming! Okay, bye. Do you know what time and what day it is today? It's eleven o'clock. Saturday. Why? Eleven o'clock. Saturday, and it's my birthday. Happy birthday, auntie. Dear, happy birthday! Don't fret anymore. I'm your daughter, mommy. You should have at least consulted me. I don't care who your new husband is! Why didn't you tell me? Didn't your aunt tell you? No! Maybe because you're always not around. How will I go back there? Where will I live? I don't wanna be homeless. I'll be away for two months. We're having our honeymoon in Hawaii. The hell with your honeymoon! I'm not gonna wait for two months. I wanna go home now! Hello, sis? [BILLIARD BALLS HITTING] Hi, Bea! - Hi! - Hello. Hi. Can I? Thank you. Don't tell me you're tired again. [CUE STICK HITTING BALL] - Hi, babe. - Hi. [CUE STICK HITTING BALL] What's wrong with you? Why don't you look at him? [HITTING BILLIARD BALL] See, he's not hip but he looks good! What's with you? [HITTING BILLIARD BALL] [CROWD CHEERING] Rest for a while, buddy. Our opponent is quite lucky. Do you have some cash? - I only brought my card here. - But I don't have any. You shouldn't have gone for double or nothing. - My suspicion is true. - What's that? You don't have money. Bea, Bea! I really need some cash. I promise I'll pay you back tomorrow. Okay, come on. Don't be angry with me. Bro, any problem? You're lucky I'm not in the mood today. [SCOFFS] You son of a bitch! Stop them! [MAN SCREAMING] Let go of me! Come here! [MAN SCREAMING] Cut it out! I won! Wait! Stop it! It's over! Cut it out! Stop it! It's over! Stop it! Stop It! I'm all right. Wait. I have to do something. Ma'am, you should have played against me. Don't come back anymore! [THINGS CLUTTERING] [LIGHT SWITCH CLICK] Are you a student or a GRO? Maybe you're forgetting that you're not in the States. Decent women here don't go home at this ungodly hour. Why don’t you send me back? I don't wanna live here anyway. Okay, fine. Go back to your spoiled friends. [DOOR OPENS] [LIGHT SWITCH CLICK] It's even better if you sell your car so that you'll stop going out. [SLAMS DOOR] [CLOSED DOOR] [CROWD TALKING] Fix the spike. It might loosen. Don't worry. I'll handle this. [CHICKEN CLUCKING] [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] We're out of luck. We lost again. How can you become a millionaire? If you always come here and lose your money? You'll always lose for sure. Someday, shit will turn to gold. See, I told you to come with me to the casino. Lots of money, lots of women! They will come at the right place and time. Aunt Martha. Good morning. There, your favorite. There, there! [TROLLEY APPROACHING] [KIDS TALKING] Martha! Hey shorty! Did you bring something for us? Hey, wait, let me see that! Are you sure these are real? Tell her that I need cash, okay? Give me that! Wait. This is not a toy. Where did you get this? Take good care of this. Where are you going later? I still don't know. Here, there. I'm so busy. Why? Do you want to go out with me? Fool! I was going to ask you to come with me. Oh, where to? Let's just go to the casino. There are lots of women there with money! Don't you want to? Brother! When are you going to bring me to the casino? You're coming with us? Better get circumcised first. Have you been circumcised? Come on. We might get late for work. Hey! Your payment? He got you, didn't he? You thought you'd get away with it. That's it. Are you going back for that? Yes. Okay. Go on! He got you, didn't he? What are you going to do now? I'm going back to the States. But I don't wanna live with my mom and her new stupid husband. Why don't you just stay here? At least you have a place to stay. Oh no, Amanda. I can't take it anymore. I feel like a chicken in a coop. I thought you were going to move? Uncle Carding's house is worse, with his nine kids, five wives, three dogs and everything else he has there. Hello? Hello. You're an American girl, why don't you live independently? That's what I'm planning to do. I just need five thousand dollars. Five thousand dollars? Sis, that's over 200 thousand pesos, okay? What kind of a miracle are you going to do to get that kind of money? You're not going to school again, aren't you? Sis, Ronnie and I made plans. I'll text you later. - Bea! - Bye! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Okay, go there now. Yes, Ma'am. Thirty, I know she's Ms. Thirty. Give it to her. Ma'am. Thank you. Thank you, Ma'am. Hi. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Try it. You'll have fun. I said five. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] What now? It's nine again. I lost again. We'll just return another time. Okay. Tomorrow. Here. Looks like our collection is small. Yes. [VEHICLES DRIVE BY] I'll leave you to take care of business now. Sure. [VEHICLES DRIVE BY] [VEHICLES DRIVE BY] [VEHICLES DRIVE BY] Let's go over there. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSED] [MUSIC PLAYING] This is new. It's good. Boss. Come here and sit down. Take something. Do you have good news? Not very. Many wakes sprouted along the railway. Don't worry. They have to bury them soon. Here, boss. The exact amount. Exact amount? Of course! That's my boy. He’s been doing okay since I picked him up in jail. My trust in him is still the same. The problem is he doesn't eat well. Hold on. Here, get some grease inside your gut. Thanks, boss. I'll go ahead. Okay. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] Wait, wait! Blackjack! Life is like a gamble. From the time you step out of your house, your life depends on others. A car may run you over, you may be robbed, but you may also win in the lottery, or in the casino. At my age, what else can I do or expect? All of my children are living their own lives. I need to look for diversions, so that I can forget the pain of being alone and lonely. Since your grandfather died, gambling has been a part of my life. I was just trying my luck, but days passed by and I realized that the games are pulling me to come over and over again. I don't know. I can't explain it. [UPBEAT MUSIC] [ENGINES REVVING] Hey man, the blue one has no chance. The black one is fully charged. Let's see if it can catch up. Are you on the blue one? The black one is going to win. Wanna bet? Sure. Bea! [ENGINES REVVING] [DOOR CLOSED] [ENGINES REVVING] [TIRE SCREECHING] [CROWD CHEERING] Faster, faster! [TIRE SCREECHING] [TIRE SCREECHING] [TIRE SCREECHING] Are you stupid? We could have won the game! Stupid bitch! Fucking asshole! [DOOR SLAMMED] [DOOR SLAMMED] Bea! Bitch. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING] Give me that. It's my turn. Later, it's my turn! Give me that. It's my turn. Ouch! Damn you! I'll stab you! Are you going to fight me? Hey, what are you doing? Give me that. Stop fighting! Stop it! [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING] [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING] Hey man, how's everything going? What in god's name did you do to stay alive? Come here! What can I do for you? I just want to borrow some money. What's up? For a... girl? Just for a girl? We have lots of things for that. Wait. I'll show you. Here. Choose from here… This! This suits you. Right? Doesn't it look old? No, it’s not! It suits on you. [OPENS LOCK] Then add some accesories, some necklace rings And this bracelet, this is just cheap. If you need anything, just go to my house in Tutuban. - Dude, I'm glad you're here! - Yeah, how are you? Does bossing know about this? Why don't you ask him, isn’t your face always following his ass? You’re right. They actually look a like. He might get pissed. [MAN LAUGHING] Come on, let’s play! Dude, let’s go there. My palms are itchy for money. Alright! Let’s go there! [SLAMMING CHIPS] Solomon. Ma’am. I need money. I’m sorry, Ma’am. But Berto doesn’t lend money to new members. Excuse me. What’s her problem? She’s running out of money. You know Berto, he doesn’t lend money if there’s no collateral. [CROWD TALKING] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CHIPS JUGGLING] Miss, can I put this here? I can feel you’re my lucky charm. You're lucky! [CHIPS JUGGLING] Thank you! You really are my lucky charm! [OBJECTS FALLING] [WOMAN LAUGHING] [WATER SPLASHING] What are you thinking, Mom?! What's wrong with our family? Starting from you, my brother, my sister are so into gambling! Where are your inherited jewelries, mom? Were they stolen or pawned? Don't tell me you also used up your pension? And now, your granddaughter is following your footsteps. [SLAMS DOOR] How rude. Mom, we're moving next week, so that you'll stop gambling! My child. You know that ever since you were little, gambling has been my life. I just gamble to have fun. I'm old and I need to amuse myself. I need some diversion. I hope you understand. [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING] [BILLIARD BALL HITTING] Hi! What's the problem? You just disappeared? Listen to me. I have a plan. But this should be a sure ball. Can you produce two hundred thousand? What game? They say you're good at gambling? How about the money? We'll split. I'll produce two hundred thousand. And rest is your problem. Can you do it? I'll do anything for you. [BILLIARD BALL HITTING] My favorite please. Right away, Ma'am. It's good now. Lots of people are back from the province. Why are you here so early? I was ordered by the boss. [TROLLEY PASSING BY] Jack, I'll go ahead. [TRAIN HONKING] The boss made a lot today. Yes, he did. Quite a sum. We should also have a share. Hey. I don’t know what’s going on in your mind. Just don’t do it. If you go against boss, he'll crush your bones. Listen to me. One time, big time man. If we hit the jackpot, we'll have lots of money. And we can get away from here. Alright, but it's your life that is at stake here. I don't want to gamble during your wake. Whatever. Damn, you're in love with Bea, aren't you? Well, she's beautiful. But take care. You're on dangerous grounds. Five thousand plus the sim card. It's loaded. Dual band. You can get that for eight in the market. I'm not sure. I can take it for 5,500. Okay. Seven. Take it or leave it. - Six thousand. - Fine, as long as it's cash. Why are you so desperate for money? Are going to have an abortion? No. I'll be a godmother in a christening. I need money to buy a gift. Stop it! Do you think I didn't know that you go to the casino? Someday, you might even sell yourself just to be able to get in there! [STUDENTS CHATTERING] What are you doing here? How much did you get? Ten thousand. You? Fifteen. I still need to get more. I'm not yet finished. Let's pawn this. Sorry sis. We have to go. [DOOR OPENS] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE STARTING] [DOOR OPENS] Bea! [VEHICLE LEAVING] [DOOR CLOSES] [VEHICLE LEAVING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [BUSY STREET] [TIRE SCREECHING] Shit! [BUSY STREET] [CAR HONKING] [BUSY STREET] Cards, cards, sir. Why did you go for double? I know what I'm doing. So let me play for a while. [CROWD TALKING] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Danny, let's stop this. I'm broke. Please. You're ruining my game. It's not our day, let's go. Bea, wait, what's with you? I was going to win that one. That's what you said a while ago. Look at this, it's almost empty. You're destroying my strategy. Give me that! Give me that! [CHIPS FALLING] Wait! Hey! We're losing! Let's forget about this. No. Do you even know what I did just to get that money? Let's leave now while we still have some money left. I lost my share. If I don't get it back, I'm dead. Then get mine. No, that's yours. All I'm asking you is a little more patience. How much do you need to get back the money? [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, man. Yes. Card? Give me a check! I'll accept it even if you postdate it for a month. Don't you trust me? I do, but this is not a charity. Wait, wait… I should have a collateral. Give me the key to your Civic. Get it back next week, or else... [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD TALKING] [CROWD TALKING] [PIANO PLAYING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Sis, just one night. I'm not in the mood to go home. Outsiders are not allowed in our dorm and you know that. Okay, bye. What did she say? [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] Danny, my aunt will get mad if she finds out that I don't have my car. Come with me. Let's fix all these. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] Hey! What's taking you so long? Go home right now! That girl is so hot! [KNOCKING HARD] Solomon! [KNOCKING HARD] Solomon! [KNOCKING HARD] Solomon! [KNOCKING HARD] Bro! [KNOCKING HARD] Wait! Hurry up, buddy. [KNOCKING HARD] What's up? Quick. [KNOCKING HARD] Coming- Come in! Ma'am! Come in. I'm sorry, this is so small. [VEHICLE PASSING BY] I said close it! We have guests. Ma'am… I'm going to be frank with you. I know Berto. He's really going to sell that Civic if you don't get it next week. You really need to do something. Can't you do something about it? I'm sorry, man. My girlfriend is going to have her birthday soon. We have to prepare that. I'm sorry. Sorry. Hon, please hurry up. Just a moment. Are you sure the taxi crashed into your car? Where is your car? In the repair shop. We're supposed to go to your Uncle Carding in the province. Aren't you going with us? I'll just follow you there. I can get my car this afternoon. I told you to sell that car of yours. It's just a headache. If I don't see you tomorrow, I'll just have you jailed, with your arrogant boyfriend. I don't know with you. Here. That's four thousand. Have that car of yours wrecked again. Just when we need to save because we don't know when your mother will send money again... I don't know what I'm going to do with you! Bea. Take this. I know you're still going to take many journeys. You will need that. Thanks, grandma. - Take care. - I will. [BUSY STREET] - Good afternoon. - Why? Do you have five there? What for? You don't have a family. You don't have a child. You don't have a wife. You don't have a house. You didn't study. What are you going to do with the money? This is personal. For what? For gambling? To pay a loan? Or to impress someone? This is a man thing. Hey, don't tell me our rooster has finally learned how to love? Please Aunt. Please. I'll pay it back promise. Since I am your aunt and because I'm nice, I'll lend you the money but it's a loan, okay? A loan! You will return it in time! But before I give it to you, you have to fill up my drum with water. Agreed! Thanks aunt! [TRAIN PASSES BY] [TROLLEY APPROACHES] Oh! What a beautiful girl! More beautiful than the morning. Oh, oh, love... What do you want to eat? We have pork stew, salted pork, fried pork, sweetened pork, sour pork, pork in sour broth... I don't eat pork. You know what miss, you're really pretty. You look like my girlfriend. Beware of that boy! He's from a family of witches. Miss, you have to watch for guys who like to drink soup. They're dangerous. - But that's true. - That's true! That's true. Watch out for that guy. He likes to breed. Sis, I need to get back my car. Can you help me? If you're going to stop gambling, maybe I can. What's happening to you? Before, it was your cellphone. Now, it's your car. What's next? Sis, I just wanna get out of this situation. Please give me a chance, please? I have some money here but it's for my tuition fee. I can lend it to you but you need to return it within this week, okay? - Yeah, I will. - If not, I'll be dropped out of school. Sis, I promise, I promise. - Here. - Thank you. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Did you win in the lottery? This is not enough! That's forty thousand. How come it's not enough? Eight percent daily interest. We didn't talk about that. I can't just have my saliva as interest. All right, two percent for you. Berto, is there a problem? Boss, we gave her forty and now she's returning the same amount. Are you sure you explained it clearly to Miss? Bea. Bea, I hope you'll forgive him. Okay. Finish your transaction first. [KEYS JANGLING] Maybe sometime, I can test-drive your Civic? I'll look forward to that. Sure. Berto, that's a babe. One of your men has her already. Who? Danny, sir. [TRAIN HONKING] [TRAIN PASSES BY] Has Bea been here? No. I don't even see her grandmother anymore in the casino. [TRAIN HONKING] [TRAIN PASSES BY] [BUSY STREET] [BUSY STREET] Hey, what's wrong with you? Drive on! [TRAIN HONKING] Hey man! [TRAIN PASSES BY] That's annoying! Good morning. - Here's my payment. - You're more beautiful than the morning. Come here and sit down. What do you want? I have fried fish here. There's also pork with blood. Pork with blood and soy sauce...What? Come here. Have you seen Danny? Why are you two looking for each other? Earlier, he was asking me if I've seen you. Come and eat. Why aren't you together? He asked me if I've seen you. I told him I haven't. Thank you. How did you become Danny's aunt? Me? That's a good question. I'm everyone's auntie when they want to eat but have no money. Oh. So it's not true that you and Danny are relatives? Of course. Danny's not my relative. How can he become my relative when he doesn't have any? He just sprang from nowhere. You mean... You mean you don't know who his parents are? No, I don't. But that's not important anymore. What's important is how he lives here everyday. That's survival. This is delicious. Have some soup. [APPROACHING TROLLEY] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] Long live the newlyweds! [CROWD CHEERING] You're really great with girls, Danny! [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] [TRAIN HONKING] Hey, do you want to use this for protection? I don't like that. No thrill. If you say so. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] [TRAIN PASSES BY] [TRAIN PASSES BY] [SHOWER POURING] What will you do if I get pregnant? What? If we have a baby, would you like a boy or girl? I'm young. I'm not ready yet. If you were to ask me, I'd like a girl. We'll name her after your mother. What's her name? Son of a bitch! Who gave you the right to dig into my past? And what do you care about my parents? I don't have a mother, and a father. I have buried them in the past. In fact, the only thing I remember about them was when they sold me when I was little! Look like money's coming in very slowly. What's happening? But Boss, we always give the income to Danny. You can even ask him. Boss, we already gave him five thousand. That's right boss. It looks like he doesn't distribute our boundaries. That can be. Aside from the boundary, he even took our territory. No, I can't let some pest do this to me. [TRAIN PASSES BY] [TRAIN HOMKING] [TRAIN PASSES BY] Bea! [TRAIN HOMKING] [TRAIN PASSES BY] [TRAIN HOMKING] The kid! [TRAIN PASSES BY] [TRAIN PASSES BY] [CROWD TALKING] The boy! Oh no! How horrible! So much blood! What's that! He shouldn't have played here. - Bea! - Danny! I'll fix it. Fine! Fix it. What's the problem here? Nothing. She just saw a child get run over by a train. That was nothing. It's okay. Right. That was nothing. One more. Bea, those are just common here. Forget about it. Let's eat. Fix that. Don't think about it Bea. Come on, let's eat. Come on. That was nothing Bea. Let's eat. You know what? Life along the railroad is a gamble. Everyday, we gamble. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CUE BALL HITTING BALL] [CUE BALL HITTING BALL] [CUE BALL HITTING BALL] Wow! That's great! [CROWD CHEERING] Your money! You lost. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] You're lucky! [CROWD CHEERING] Wow, impressive! You're great! Hey, my share! Let's go. Come on. Over there. He's coming down. Sorry. I have to go. Okay, come again! [UPBEAT DRUM ROLL] [BUSY STREET] [BUSY STREET] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [DOOR OPENS] Hey! You jerk! There! Punch him! Punch him! Punch him! [INTENSE MUSIC PALYING] Hey! [INTENSE MUSIC PALYING] You're running? Man, are you all right? Son of a bitch! Come on! Let's go! [TRAIN PASSING BY] Ouch! Ouch! [TRAIN PASSING BY] [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] [DOOR OPENS] Come in. Let's go. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Sir. Later, okay? Do you know this guy? Oh yes, I know him. He's enrolled here. He's always in the company of Benz owners. Hey man, we'll fix everything about that kid. Let us take care of that, okay? Thank you. Hurry up! Let's go there! Slowly! Pepito always helps me. Who's Pepito? He's like a professor in a school. A great professor. Surprise! Go away! I'll slap each one of you! Come on! Faster! Who are they? They're homeless and were adopted by Pepito. So now, they are experts in snatching. By the way Bea, would you like us to sit down? Sure. We'll stay here for a while. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sit down. How was your trip? It was fine, boss. Jackson went here two days ago. He said you always get the collections early. How's your new girlfriend? I counted that right, boss. It's the exact amount. Relax, pretty boy. I know I can trust you. Let's talk about this. Come here. I'm going to ask you a favor. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Are you Danny? Is this what you need? Where's the girl you're always with? Who? Bea! You're looking for the wrong person. I'm not that guy. Wait! Just a minute! Hey, wait! Come here for a while. You animal! [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, stop that! Hey! Police! Run! Buddy, what happened? Come on, let's go! Relax. What happened to you? Boss played with him. You're making me nervous! Does boss already know? I don't know. Listen to me kid. You're against the wall. You can't fight with a knife and a pipe. What you need are bullets! You know who's going to help you? Who? Old man will! Old man owns every gambling den from the city jail to the railroad. He has a lot of connections in the police. So, when boss was fired from the service... There, he got him. So, there's Pepito, boss and now Old Man. Do they know each other? Old man is the root, Boss is the trunk, and Pepito is the branch. How about you? Are you the leaf, the thorn or the fruit? You choose. The thorn I think. Because when it comes to girls, he's sharp. Old Man is nice. He even gave all his gambling dens to Boss. Problem is, this man even entered the casino. He used Old Man's money to go about the business. And Old Man doesn't know about it. [ENGINE REVVING] [PLATES CLANKING] Hey Danny. Come in. Old Man is over there. Come with me. [CROWD TALKING] Come here. Take a seat, please. It's good that you paid a visit. I thought we were going to see each other in City Jail once again. Why? Is your boss treating you bad? Well, actually that's why I am here. Oh, well, anyway, your timing is just right. Tomorrow is the town's fiesta. I'll show you around then. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, And the kid too. You all look tired. You relax for a while, take a shower and rest. - Let's just talk tomorrow. - Thank you. Hey kid, wait. She's beautiful. You're lucky but I noticed something. Do you want to tell me something? The man didn't want to talk but the girl spoke readily. Tell the men! Let's attack first! [COINS JANGLING] Five! Five! Guys, please move aside! If I tell you to move, move fast! Solomon! Come here! Stay here and relax. Hurry up! [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] What are those for? I have to go back to Manila. Why? Old Man wants me to take care of something. I'll go with you. That can't be. It's too dangerous in Manila, and it would be better for you to stay here. And besides... Old Man will look after you. - It's safe here. - I don't want to. I don't want you to leave me. Something wrong might happen to you. I can take care of myself. Do you understand? Do you get it? [WOMAN MOANING] [WOMAN MOANING] [WOMAN MOANING] [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] You know Danny? You showed me a world that I didn't see in America. Thank you. There's nothing that you need to thank me for because you've gone through hell. I don't know. Whatever it is, heaven or hell, I'm happy as long as I'm with you. Come back here! Give me that money! Go there! Give it to me! Give me that! You plan to keep that? Give it to me! Give me that! [TABLES DESTROYED] Give me that! Okay, give the money! Bring out your money! Have pity on us! [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Auntie, I brought you something. You might want to eat. Pancit Bihon, Pancit Malabon, Pancit Canton, and of course, your favorite Pancit Luglug. Come on, let's eat. What do you say to that? Auntie? Boss has already had Solomon killed. Take care of yourself. [CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] Are your bets complete? They are. Sure? Yes. Okay, let's pick the next one. Letter N. Thirty-one! Three, one. What happened to Solomon? Who's that? Solomon! Oh no! We just took him from the morgue! Two thousand per day! Shit! [THINGS CLATTERING] [THINGS CLATTERING] No please! Tomorrow, you return his body in the morgue! Yes! Make sure about that! Yes! I will! [THINGS CLATTERING] [CHEERFUL MUSIC] [CROWD TALKING] So, do you want to try that? Don't be afraid. It's really simple. It's a pity that only a few people know how to make those balloons and make it fly. Thanks a lot. [CHEERFUL MUSIC] [CROWD TALKING] [CHEERFUL MUSIC] [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] Let's go over there! [CROWD CHEERING] [FIREWORKS SIZZLES] [CROWD CHEERING] [FIREWORKS POPPING] [CROWD CHEERING] Let go of me! [GUN SHOTS] [GUN SHOTS] I wasn't able to wait for your invitation to test drive your car, so I just found a way to see you. What do you want from me? It's easy. What? - Do you love Danny? - Yes. Then, you’re ready to sacrifice everything for him. What did he do? He's a traitor! Do you know what’s the punishment for his sins? Death! But he already paid for it. Not yet. It's still not enough. What more do you need? His life. But... But what? But if you can exchange something for his life, we can talk about it. [OMNIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [OMNIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Go on and walk! I don't know anything! Nothing! I don't know where boss gets the money! Where's Bea? You sold me to them, didn't you? And you killed Solomon, didn't you? Boss did it! Boss did! He just ordered me to do it! I just follow orders! He just ordered me! [OMNIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Stop moving! [KNIFE STABBED] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] Hold him! Asshole! [GUN CLICKING] You fooled us! You made it difficult for us to catch you! [GUN SHOT] [BOY SCREAMS] [MUFFLED NOISE] [BOY SCREAMS] For sure, they disarmed Danny and the rest. [CROWD TALKING] He has tons of money. Jackson is coming. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CLAMMORING] [GUN CLICKING] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] You go first! [OMNIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [KNOCKING HARD] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [DOOR SLAMMED] [DOOR CRASHES] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] Whatever happens, keep this money.
