DISTRIBUTED BY ATG PRODUCED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE DIRECTOR'S COMPANY & ATG Get me some tea! Thanks, that's what I need! You should quit as a fisherman and be a singer. I'm beat. Good job. I don't want to sell my land, and I'm opposed to the amusement park. How about you, old timer? Like you said, I'm not young. Going out to sea isn't worthwhile anymore. First, they'll feed us a line about how great it is. Remember the plan for yellowtail aquaculture? They promised us a big time payday, but we ended up getting Chump change. The project fell through and they skipped out. Overfeeding left the seabed rotten. How long will it take for the ocean to recover? Don't shout, it's bad for business. Do you have to keep taking photos like this!? Shohei! Are you OK? You tell the old man, Shohei! First the observation tower and now the amusement park. Maybe our mothers and daughters can swim naked for a water show. Then, when the "Sweating Buddha" statue sweats the black sweat of misfortune, the whole damn thing will be washed away in a storm! Keisuke! Keisuke, wait! I'll call you a cab. Wait at the restaurant. Forget it, I'd just start drinking again. Grow up, man. It's pathetic. I'm tired, and maybe I want to quit. But dammit, we're fishermen! It's pathetic that we can be bought out so easily by building contractors! I wouldn't know about that. That's because you're the spoiled, rich son of the Miyamoto empire. - Asshole! - Keisuke! We're not cut from the same cloth. And my cloth is a fisherman's uniform. MERMAID LEGEND SHIRAO Mari ETO Jun SHIMIZU Kentaro AOKI Yoshio MIYASHITA Junko KAN DA Takashi KATQ Kazuo TSUJI Mancho SEKI Hiroko EMI Juntaro MIYAGUCHI Seiji Directed by IKEDA Toshiharu When I pull the rope, you have to bring me up immediately! I know that. - You were late! - You have to pull harder. Then you go down next time. If that's how you feel, you can do it by yourself. If we can't catch abalone, we won't be able to eat anything but cold rice. Don't you forget it! She'd be a fine gal if she didn't talk so much. We got four big ones. You're the best. You silly pickle, it's just luck. What the hell is that greenhorn doing? Idiot. He isn't going to catch anything this far inland. There are nets up! Watch out! I've haven't heard a thing. Could you check with the fishing association? If there were such an accident, a body would certainly have surfaced. It wasn't an accident, someone was killed! Really? Where? None of your business. Nobody fishes there at night. Stop all of this talk about death and murder. - It'll hurt our business. - Who asked you! You could put your mind to better use thinking of ways to catch more abalone. I do. I'd be ashamed about such a meager haul! Shut up already! Keisuke, I'll look into it for you. - Newlyweds sure do fight! - After reconciliation it's even better! I'm going home. If anyone wants to buy him, you can have him for cheap! This is awful. If you care to remember, it was your company that built it. It was our company's first contract. We researched as much as we could... This is the result of your research? We could have made money out of this project. Mr. Miyamoto! The mayor and the Chairman of the Fishing Association. - What do you want? - We need to talk. - We'll be waiting upstairs. - I'll be along. I want you to repair all of this, free of charge. This is Mr. Ota and Mr. Tani of Kinki Electric Power's Location Development. - I'm Ota. - I'm Tani. Are they here to talk money? Don't be rude, Mr. Miyamoto. It depends on how the conversation goes. I have something to show you. Our plan is to acquire all of this land under the guise of an amusement park. - How's it going? - It's proceeding smoothly. You'll meet Mr. Shimogawa from the Kansai Tourist Development Company. As busy as bees, they are! - Is Shimogawa here? - Not yet. - I see. He went out fishing last night and hasn't returned yet. - Mr. Shimogawa... - You know him? - We met him. - What'll become of your staff? I'll fire everyone. - Hey, make sure to get the rust off. - Right, boss. If you lose one round, you'll raise your game in the next. That's how I do things! Boss, we've prepared a discreet place. I think we should talk there. Right here. Keisuke, we're here. I'm terribly sorry about this. I can't believe that you're drinking like this! Ever since we were kids, I never wanted to lose to him. But he always wins. He can even outdrink the women. I've never seen him so dead drunk. - You must hate me. - On the contrary. I'm grateful. Migiwa, Shohei and I are going out drinking again! Don't go! Thank you. You dope. An amusement park... Ridiculous! Drink some water. Let's go to bed. Hey... What would you do if I died? Are you thinking about that night fishing boat again? What would you do if I died? I'd marry a man who doesn't drink. - I see. - Just kidding. If you do, I'll haunt you to your dying day! And what if I died? Even if someone kills you, you wouldn't die. Don't worry. Maybe all this was just a dream. Migiwa! We won't make money, if I search for it on workingdays. I won't do anything bad. I just want to chase away my husband's bad dreams. Please don't be angry. Hey! - What are you doing? - Worrying won't do you any good. What? Oh, the fishing boat. You were talking about it in your sleep. I'll dive and look for it. I'll get ready. What are you doing? - Taking the boat out. - But today's a fishing holiday. - We're not going to fish. - Hey, let's go! Long ago, the Buddha seeped black sweat on this day and nine diving women died. I know. I asked the Buddha's permission. - You'll be next! - Don't go out! Don't worry! - Here? - Yes. The current is strong, but you might find something that hasn't been washed away. What is it? I thought marrying you was a mistake. Fool! That's supposed to be my line. Maybe it cuts both ways. - Don't take any unnecessary risks. - You're unusually kind today. I'm humbled by this honor. Take care! I will. Just make sure to haul me up when I tug the rope. Who does she think she's talking to? I told them not to go out. Did they cast off over there? - No, between the inlet and that low saddle. - Over there. Keisuke! Wait. Wait! My husband... Aren't you Migiwa Saeki? - My husband was killed. - What? When I was diving, my husband's body suddenly sank down. Then the tide rushed in, and I don't remember what happened after that. It's OK. You did the right thing turning yourself in. "Turning myself in"? You killed your husband and tried to kill yourself. No, you've got it all wrong! They killed my husband and left me for dead! Calm down! Hey! Come back! Don't run! Don't go! You always want me to come when the bar is busy. It's bad for business. Why? Why did this have to happen to us? I don't know. I suppose my mother's death doesn't really compare. - You could go to Watakano Island. - Watakano Island? Only women live on the island. You should blend in easily enough. Why do I have to run? That cop is badly injured. The police will blame it on you. They're conspiring to frame me for murder. It's their job to be suspicious. They're just doing their job. There's no police on Watakano Island, so it should work out all right. I talked to the owner of a bar I know. She's sweet on me, so she'll help. BAR OSAKA - Good evening, party of one? - I need to talk to the owner. Hey, it's the camera man! Long time, no see. As you can see, we're exhibiting your photos elegantly. Go ahead. This way. The last girl left a few things behind. Feel free to use them. Come in. - It's hot. - Don't! The window faces the hills. It's not safe if it's lit. - Even during business hours? - That's the deal. Make yourself at home. That's Natsuko. She's not bad. Have a seat. It sure is hot. I guess it's okay, if the lights are out. I wonder if his body has surfaced? It won't, because the current is too strong. That's good. I entrusted him with my life every day. He always pulled me up. Those clothes look good on you. My departed dear mother wasn't good for anything but catching abalone. She was ugly, her face always dark from sunburns. You knew her. Yes. The fishermen jumped her for illegal fishing. She died. That makes me the son of a thief. You're leaving? - You think I did it? - No, it's not that... Don't go! - I'll throw this away for you. - Don't! I'll keep in touch. My husband and I didn't do anything wrong. I believe you. ISHIYOSHI CONSTRUCTION Hey! Hey, are you up yet? You should get something to eat! The owner asked me to get you something to eat! Hurry up! You hear me! Come on! This way. Come on in! Sit down. You haven't washed your face. There's a basin out back. Where's the towel... here you go. Wash! Hurry! Hurry! Honey! Hurry and wake up! Breakfast's waiting! Shohei! Hey, Shohei! Could you get the car out for me? What! I'm not your chauffeur. My chauffeur can't come in today. You seem very busy since Shimogawa disappeared. Are you working with the electric power company officials? Why are you acting so coy? Your necktie is too plain. It is? Forget about it and take a look at this. I don't know anything about this. Just look at it! Is this...? - A once in a lifetime opportunity. - The amusement park? That was nixed. This is the only project left to us. You know that fisherman named Keisuke? Did you kill Keisuke? I'm never directly involved in such things. What's the difference? I told you, it was the chance of a lifetime! Sometimes your hands get a little dirty! Not a word of this to anyone! I've lived there almost my whole adult life. After I met my husband we came here. Four years after the War ended. Whenever there was a storm, scores of large ships would dock here. They completely surrounded the island. It was a thriving place. Tell me more. I want you to leave. I don't want to get involved in it. Natsuko's brothel is all I can handle. My husband read about it in the newspaper... All about your "incident". He said he wants you off the island. Stubborn old man. - That's not how it happened. - I really don't care. Just go. Shohei, telephone! Shohei! Hello, may I ask who you are? - They won't give a name. - Hello? Mr. Miyamoto, we should probably leave now. Already? Let's have another drink. Let's postpone that until we go to Watakano Island. Nobody goes to Watakano Island for the liquor! See you. I understand. I'll come meet you tomorrow. - It looks like the project is on track. - Yes. When I'm on board, everything falls into place. Are you going to Watakano Island? The day after tomorrow. I invited the guys from Kinki Electric Power. The day after tomorrow? Shohei... Who was that? On the phone. - Just a girl. - That much I could tell. - Who is she? - A girl not easily seduced. I know I've heard that voice somewhere. It must've been the night that Keisuke was murdered... - Dad... - She called that night. I remember well. Dad. Was it his wife, Migiwa? - So what if it was? - This is a fine kettle of fish. Why? I don't know whether I can cover your ass on this one. What do you mean? You could meet the same end as Keisuke. I thought that you decided to kill both Keisuke and Shimogawa on your own. I'm talking about people that you can't just reason with. Listen, just keep your mouth shut. You don't know anything. And I'll pretend I didn't hear anything. OK? Forget all of it! I'm going to bed. Remember what you told me about your dead mother? I forgot. You said that she wasn't good for anything but catching abalone. I'm the same. I can't do anything but fish for abalone. Coming here I realized that. When I look back, all we did was fight. We fought on the boat, we fought on the way home, then at dinner, we'd fight again. Now that I'm here, I think morning, noon, and night... about who'd kill him and who'd try to kill me? Who set it up? "Who? Who? Who?" is all I can think. The only thing that comes to my mind is... my husband's face. When he was confused, he just smiled. I should shut the window. Natsuko will be angry. It rains. A cloudburst. Just kidding. It was just a joke. What...? What... are you doing? Turn out the light. Do you want to run? Where to? I don't know... - To Osaka? - Why? You like it here? No, but even if I can't be in the same town, I want to be near him. I have something to tell you... If you like it so much here, you might stay for good. What are you...? Your life is worth nothing to my father. Your father? Where have you been? There's a call for you! Use your head, girly! Hello? It's Shohei. Did you find out anything? No, stay where you are. I want you to stay there at least through tomorrow. You started to say something about your father... Are you seeing him tomorrow? - We didn't discuss it. - I see. That's too bad... His father is coming, so I thought he might be here to rescue his princess. - His father is Mr. Miyamoto? - Yes. He's holding a banquet. All of the girls will be working tomorrow. Tomorrow Mr. Miyamoto will hold a banquet? This banquet... May I take part in it? What? Please, I'd like to attend Mr. Miamoto's banquet. Really? You'd be a big help. But don't you mind? He's Shohei's father. It could be unpleasant. I don't mind. Working the banquet will mean taking a customer who's to stay the night. You're still willing? Excuse me. Where's your wife? Off yammering with someone, no doubt. I'll come back later. Is there anything you need? I was hoping she'd let me make an offering to the Buddha. If our altar will do, be my guest. Make an offering for us too, while you're at it. This is all we have. - I don't need anything. - Have it anyway. It's dinnertime. By the way, I can't leave this island now. I don't own this island. Oh... Ma made me out to be the bad guy? She told you that I wanted you off the island? - I'm right, aren't I? - Don't you? It was her idea, but she didn't mean any harm. You must forgive us. You're forgiven. She just didn't want to be involved. She has a sharp tongue, but she's actually very kind. Does she treat you well? You might not understand at your age, but I decided long ago to take care of her until my death. When I came back from the War, she was the lover of an army buddy. That's her'? Sure enough. That pruny old crone. He asked me for it as he lay dying. I didn't do it, because he was dying for his country. I suppose it was because his death seemed so pointless. It would've have made more sense, if he'd been killed by his wife or something. My husband told me that if he died, he'd haunt me. But I've seen no sign. Pay your respects to him properly. Hey, babe! Pour me a drink. I came late, so I've to catch up. Do you know Mr. Miyamoto? No, not really. Are you going to spend the night with him? It's not decided yet. Then, how about me? - Aren't you... his employee? - Yes, that's right. I'm his right-hand man. You promised a yakuza that you'd spend the night with him? - Yes. - Are you sure? It's your first time. - I'll be fine. - I don't want any trouble. - Want a drink? - Nope. - I have a question. - What? There was an incident in a nearby town. A young fisherman was killed in his boat. - That guy killed by his wife? - Yes. Do you know whether Miyamoto was mixed up in it? Yes. Mr. Miyamoto had him killed. - Then why was the wife blamed? - Oh, that? We failed to kill both of them. So, we pinned the crime on her. Why... Why did you want to kill them? The fisherman, Keisuke, witnessed the murder of Shimogawa. Kinki Electric Power is scrambling to build the nuclear power plant. - A nuclear power plant? - Right. But problems occured to purchase the land for it. So we cooked up the plan about the amusement park as a ruse. That's how Mr. Miyamoto got caught up in it. Shimogawa's stubbornness got him killed. Then we killed Keisuke as the sole witness. Only ordinary people worry about such mundane things. Enough of the Q&A. Take off your clothes. All of it. Come here! This body is too good to kill, Mrs. Migiwa. Mr. Miyamoto's son is even worse than his father. He wanted me to kill a beautiful woman like you! - You mean Shohei...? - Yep. He said this girl with a cut on her arm. I wanted to kill you as husband and wife. I'll show you heaven in your last minutes on earth. Then I'll send you quietly into the next life. Mrs. Migiwa... Turn out the light. Shut up! Get away! Get away! God, the smell... What is it? I see... That's the smell of blood. It was because of a nuclear power plant... Darling. It seems to be a stupid reason to die for. Darling... You can rest in Buddha's paradise now. Shohei, could you grab me a beer? Huh, he's not here. Who are you? I have a favor to ask. - Give me back my husband. - What? Give him back! I don't care about your nuclear power plant! Nor if it's on the beach or in the ocean! Just give me back my husband! Bring him here right now! Are you crazy? Murderer! Give him back! You stupid bitch! - Sir. - OK. How's everyone doing? I have to get ready for the wake. Be at the groundbreaking ceremony tomorrow. Don't let us down. Don't forget, you could be next. You're obligated to succeed your father at Miyamoto Industries. Miyamoto had been planning a party in the observation tower. Yes, I've inherited the position. We can't possibly leave the company in the hands of that halfwit. We didn't plan to engage a jerkwater outfit like this anyhow. WORLDLY NAME: KEISUKE SAEKI DIED AGED 29 MIYAMOTO INDUSTRIES The deal is done. Disappear. Why did you disrupt our mourning ceremony? I'm here for a funeral, too. Shame on you... You should've waited for me. HAMAMACHI NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SITE Darling! COMMEMORATING THE CONSTRUCTION OF HAMAMACH'S NEW NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ASSEMBLYMAN DAIJI HANAOKA RECEPTION TONIGHT The other day I... drank a glass of water from a nuclear reactor. I couldn't believe how tasty it was. I was just joking. People tend to equate nuclear power plants with nuclear weapons. I frequently hear, "The radiation, isn't it dangerous?" But these are the fears of the uninformed. I beg you to sweat black. And please, make it storm tonight. To wreak havoc, I beg you for a terrible storm. You must be every bit as capable as your father. Mr. Hanaoka, Sir, let me shake your hand. Don't move! Go to the entrance. Move! What... what're you... Where are the people building the plant? Where are the men who killed my husband? Stop! This is madness! That's because I'm insane! I don't like the light. They just keep coming... Killing is supposed to wrap things up... But no matter how many I kill, they just keep coming. There's no end to it. Darling... Your death... Who was really responsible? Darling... This is no laughing matter. Darling. Darling! You have to make sure to surface closer to the boat! Darling! Here you go! Dive! You make sure to pull me up quickly. Directed by Toshiharu IKEDA
