[Instrumental Christmas Music] ♪ [Instrumental Christmas Music] ♪ Deep in the valleys of Vermont, there's a town called "Evergreen," where... Now, storybook, let's not rush things. I was just getting to that. Our story starts in a city that's not so far away. A place bustling with the busy rush of Christmas shoppers. [Jazzy rendition of "12 Days of Christmas"] ♪♪ [Jazzy rendition of "12 Days of Christmas"] ♪♪ Does this line up? Yeah, perfectly. [sighs] Ugh, I've got to start over. Good. I thought we were actually going to be done in time to get dinner. You know, symmetry is just - Lazy design? Yes, I know. Yup. Note to self: When we open our own store, everything's gonna have to be just slightly off-kilter. Yet, impeccably designed. ...and locally sourced. Mm-hmm. [chuckles] Tree really does look great. [sighs] Yeah. Yeah, it does. Wait, do you think we need a second tree back there? You know what? I was just thinking that. I mean, it would pull the eye of the customer back that way. Yeah, and that's where the most expensive items are. We need a second tree. -Second tree. -Yeah. [knocking at door] Oh! There's Polly. Hi! Hello! Come on in. [gasps] It looks amazing in here! Oh my gosh! Yeah, we, uh, pulled the counter to the side of the store. Which opens up the flow from the door to the rest of the store. And you redesigned the entire shelving unit. It looks great over there. Oh my. And to top it all off, you decorated for Christmas. Is that a partridge? In a pear tree. Yes, it is. And, we have, two turtle doves, three French hens, four calling birds, and... five golden rings. Oh! [giggles] It's just a little service that we throw in for jobs this time of year. You two are the best at redesigning stores like this. Have you ever thought of opening your own store? -Well, in fact, yes. -Eventually. Yes. Eventually. [laughs] Yes. Well, you know I'm expanding, right? I plan to open three new stores in the new year. Wow, that's... that's great. Where you thinkin'? I'm still searching for locations, but I would love to have your expertise in designing them. if you're free for more work. Oh. Ah...Yes! -Yeah! -Yeah. Of course, we would love to help in any way we can. Oh, wonderful! Oh, my goodness look at this. [both laugh] Bye Polly. See ya. [sighs] You know, if we keep getting work at this rate, we'll be able to open up our own store in less than two years. Yeah, the very best in home decoration and design. Custom kitchen wear, fixtures, design accessories. Everything you need to turn your house into a home. What? Nothing, it's just... I love what we do. We get to travel around, and redesign spaces, and... I know. I know. But I mean, hey. We've been together through every business decision, every terrible date. Look, all I'm saying is that I'm just not sure I'm ready to put down roots and stay in one place. Speaking of which, someone has their final New Years' resolution from last year to take care of, and time is ticking! [groans] Hey, every year we make these resolution lists, and every year you have the same goal. I know, visit my hometown for Christmas. I know, I know. But what if it's not the same as I remember as a kid? Well then, either way, you'll cross it off your list! But I was just thinking that maybe I should wait for my parents to go... But your parents are in Europe... and working. Now you can go back to your hometown. Let me show you. Look. That's what it is. Yeah, it's gorgeous. Isn't it cute? Yeah. Okay, come on. Drive off to this almost real-life Santa's Village, take a quick look, and then come back to Boston in time for Christmas Eve dinner. And by the looks of that town, you'll be dressed up as one of Santa's elves, and handing out candy canes. [laughs] You know, I think you underestimate how good I would be as one of Santa's helpers. I don't think I am. Now, get on the road. Have fun, enjoy. Hey... What's the name of the town, again?

You're just messing with me. I am, I am. No, seriously. Can I do something to help? Uh... how are you with old engines? Astonishingly good. Really? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Okay, all right. What have we got here? Have you tried this? Yep. Okay. What about this? Twice. Uh, bet you have not tried... Yeah, I tried that. Didn't seem to work. Okay. All right. Let me just...

[engine starts] Hey! Teamwork, huh? Yeah! Although, I contend I did most of the work, and most of that before you got here. That is fair, that is fair. However, had I not come along, you'd still be standing here with your little feet in the snow. Also fair. [laughs] You, uh, heading into Evergreen? Am I that obvious? Christmas tourist, snow globe. Lucky guess. It's the only road in and out of town. -Oh. -Yeah. Oh. Oh yeah, there's that, huh? There is that. Oh. Uh, well, um... Thanks. You're welcome! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas and all that. [laughs] Welcome to Evergreen! Thanks. [honks] Dear Santa. This year for Christmas, I would like... (Daisy) I seem to give away more candy-canes away every year. I remember when your parents would come in for them. Here you go. Did you write your Christmas letter to Santa? Yes. Oh, thanks for coming, Henry. The storeroom shelf needs a little patch. Sure thing, Daisy. Did you put your truest Christmas wish in your letter? Maybe. Are you sure I can read it? "Dear Santa. "This year for Christmas, "I want to have Christmas in Evergreen every year." Is that your truest wish? Well, we're moving away, and I'm excited, but... I love Evergreen, so... Lisa, what about this? What if instead of saying you'd like to have Christmas in Evergreen every year, you'd like to have Christmas like it is in Evergreen. That way, wherever you go, you can always feel the warmth of home. Every year. Excuse me. Huh? Can you tell me what happened to Daisy's store? Oh, they closed. A little over a year ago. Aww. It's a shame. I... I loved that place. Truly, it was the anchor of town. Made of joy, that place. Yeah... And Daisy? Daisy... passed away this year. Oh... Oh, I'm sorry. What, did you know her? Uh, well, uh, only sort of. I mean, I was actually born here, but then we moved away when I was about seven. You probably went to Kindergarten with my daughter, Allie. Always wore pigtails, always chasing animals? Oddly enough, I do have a memory of that, yes! Lisa Palmer. Ah... Palmer. Were your parents scientists? No, military? Right? Uh, right on both accounts. Wow, you have a great memory. I'm Carol, and this is my husband Joe. We own the Kringle Kitchen. Hi. Nice to meet you. Oh, you guys own the Kringle Kitchen. Love this place. And the snow globe's still here! Oh, it sure is, granting wishes by the dozen. We get a lot of people from all over coming to our Christmas Eve festival. Ah, Kevin. Hey! My vegetables. Yes. Hey, sorry I'm late, Joe. Had to deliver a few more trees. I'll take these in. Oh, sure. Lisa, this is Kevin. Oh, we met on the road. She is an astonishingly good mechanic. [laughs] I gave him a little help with the truck. It was my Dad's. Now it belongs to my daughter. She's in Florida visiting her boyfriend's family. Come back for dinner! Yeah, I will. 'Kay? See ya, Joe. -See ya later, Carol. -Hey, Kev. We've got to stop running into each other like this. Yeah. Townspeople are gonna start to talk. Ah, it's what they do best. Well, that, and uh, harmonize the last three bars of any Christmas carol. [laughs] See ya. Bye. [Jazzy version of "Deck the Halls"] ♪♪ [Jazzy version of "Deck the Halls"] ♪♪ Wow! Those are beautiful. Oh, I meant to get those up, but... No, no, no. No, no worries. They're gorgeous. Are they hand-blown? Yeah! Did you... make them? I did! Thank you. I'm Megan. Nice to meet you. I actually have a reservation. - Lisa Palmer. -Yeah. You'll be in Room 8. I'm Hannah, by the way. Hi, Hannah. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Michelle. Welcome to Evergreen. Hi Michelle, nice to meet you. Everybody is just so nice here. Good, you brought the tree. Oh, wow. [laughs] Come on! Seriously? This is getting slightly weird. Yeah, I don't know who's following who. [both laugh] Oh, I'll, uh, I'll get this tree set up for you. (Megan) Thank you! Ma'am. Sir. (Hannah) So, you've met Kevin already. Yeah, yeah... um. Like three times today. [laughs] You're all checked in. You're upstairs second door on the left. Let me get this for you. Thank you. Thanks ladies. All packed up? Why so sad? You're on your way to a new home and that's an awfully big adventure. But I don't want a new home. How will Santa know how to find us? Oh, Lisa. Santa knows how to find all boys and girls. No matter where you go, Christmas will find you. You have a good trip, and mind your parents. And come back to visit us soon, okay? Off you go. Oh, hey Lisa! I didn't want you to have to eat alone. Oh, you're so sweet. I hear you went to elementary school here. Yeah. I'm actually the principal of the elementary school now. Oh... I'm Michelle. Cool. And this is... Ezra. I'm the mayor of Evergreen. Oh, nice to meet you... Wow, the mayor! Well, I have to tell you, your little town is the dictionary definition of charming. It is really great. Well, let's hope we can keep it that way. Ezra. Why would you say that? Sorry, I've been distracted. Trying to get the general store sold has been weighing on me. [clears throat] Ezra. No business at the dinner table. There is no stress in the Kringle Kitchen. Unless we get the general store sold, we could end up with a chain store, or... fast food. It would put smaller places like this out of business, our tourism trade could dry up. But mainly, Evergreen wouldn't be so... Evergreen. And, who owns Daisy's store now? I do. Daisy was my godmother. Oh, sorry. Anyway, looking to sell it. Let me just take a look at something. Well, it could use a good staging. Staging? It, uh, staging. It's like when you're going to sell a house, you add furniture and paint a few walls. Just to make it more attractive to the potential buyer. Could you do that to a store? Yeah. During an early snowstorm, the roof practically caved in. We're going to have to fix that beam. [sighs] Need to brighten the place up, put some Christmas decorations... if you want to sell it that quickly. Quick is what we're after. If I can't sell by the end of the year, the store's going back to the bank. They've already said that they'd repossess it. [coughs] Well, I won't lie, I mean, it's not going to be easy. But I have seen places in worse conditions turned around on tighter schedules. [sighs] All right. Tell you what I'll do. Point me in the direction of your town's best contractor. I'll get this place fixed up and ready to sell by Christmas. Kevin... is a contractor. Of course he is. But he's only in town for a week, staying with his dad. Well, I mean, I don't really need more than a week, I don't think. Well, he's good. Very precise. Kevin! Hi! Let's just say that I was getting ready to start a project and I needed someone... handy with tools. [chuckles] You gonna buy Daisy's store? Uh, uh... No, no, no, no, no. I'm just gonna fix it up for Christmas and get it ready for a buyer. No, no, no, no. Just throwing up a few decorations won't help. That place needs a lot of work. I know... Which is why I need someone to help me do that. And you think I'm your man? Well, I have no idea if you're my man, but I'm willing to bet that you care about this place just as much as any of these other people. I do. Why do you care? I don't know, because I have some pretty special memories here too. Look, take a week and help me do this. I'm sorry, I... Look, it... it just... It's not enough time to get it done right. What are you talking about, of course we have enough time. I mean, I have tons of experience, and I'm sure that you... have some experience too, right? Yeah, I... Yes. Look, I... I... I started off doing freelance construction gigs, I uh, over time people realized I was pretty good at leading a team, a good eye for detail, that kind of thing. And after a while word got around, now I get calls from all over. People bring me in as a kind of foreman-for-hire. Just finished a library in Denver. Ah, see, you're perfect for this! But look, even if you had a whole fleet of magical helpers- Which I don't. But I'm willing to bet that you know some people. Yeah, who I'd have a hard time getting to work over the holidays. Not if you told them that it's a Christmas gift for the entire town. [chuckles] You are really persistent. Yes, I am, I am. Okay, so then what's in it for you, if you don't mind me asking. I don't know. I guess it just feels like something I should do. And, plus, I was told that you are the best contractor in this town. I am the only contractor in this town. Yeah, there is that. Look, I can promise you we will be fast. No, no, no. If we're going to do this, it can't be rushed or thrown together. Oh, no, no, no. Not rushed or thrown together. We work fast, but smart. Deal? Deal. [Jazzy version of "Jingle Bells"] ♪♪ What can I get for you? Good morning. I would love a peppermint hot cocoa please. Right in on the Christmas spirit, good for you. And what can I get for you, Kevin? Oh, coffee, just black. Please. What? T'is the season, Kevin. Yeah. Live a little. Oh, okay, fine. Um... Coffee with whipped cream, then. Caramel? No. Wait, uh... Yes? Yes. Yes. Please. [laughs] Okay, so I want to get some decorations, and I would love to stop by a Christmas tree lot. Do you guys have one of those? Uh, we have five. You have five? Yeah, it's gonna be a tough choice, but I'll probably push for the one my dad runs. Yeah, I think that's pretty much a safe bet. Yeah, he'll appreciate that. [laughs] Um... and you know what, I was thinking we could use a tree on the outside and then a smaller one on the inside. Don't you think two trees is a bit much? Ambition is the key to success. And here you go. Merry Christmas. Oh, Merry Christmas to you. Thanks Joe. Thank you. All right, and first thing's first, we need a good window display and supplies. I got a guy. Mm-hmm. Okay, so I'd like to get some pine garland. Lots of white paint. Sure. And some wainscotting.

You never know what you're gonna find. What are all these keys? Well, we don't know what they actually go to, but you know every time you throw out a key, you find a lock that it might fit. What about this one? Hmm. Been here long before my day. Look, uh, anything you... you find here in these boxes for a nickel a piece. Are you sure? Christmas discount.

Yeah, you remember my brother Thomas and my nephew David. Oh, yes of course, Thomas. Good to have you back. It's good to be back. We missed the Kringle Kitchen and your incredible apple dumplings. Why thank you. Um, Thomas... Have you met Michelle? Oh. The famous Michelle. Anna talks about you all the time, and somehow we haven't met. Yeah. Always miss each other when you're in town, I guess, yeah. Oh, nice to meet you! Nice to meet you. [laughs] Well come on and take your coat off, and have a seat right next to Michelle.

Well, then, shall we get the wishing started. Hmm-hmm, my favourite part. So, Thomas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you and David spend Christmas here every other year, right? Yes, my ex-wife and I, we trade off Christmases, yeah. I see. [laughs] So what did you wish for? Dad, you know if I tell you, it wouldn't come true. Oh! Hey, Lisa! Hey. Why don't you come join us? This is my brother Thomas, and my nephew David. Hi, it's nice to meet you. Hi. So, how's the store update coming? Oh, well, uh... Well, it's a work in progress. We're getting there. [chuckles] What's that? This? This is a key that Kevin and I found at the hardware store. Still haven't found a place to put it, though. Where does it go to? Well, now that is a very, very good question. I don't know. It could go to anything in this town, really. It's kind of like a little puzzle. Well... how are you going to figure it out? Sounds like you'd have to try every keyhole in town. [sighs] Right? I mean, sounds like a lot of work, huh? I mean, I just imagine all the locks that this key could open. I just wish I had somebody... that would maybe be... Wait a minute, would... would... would you want to try? Yes! Yeah! Yeah? Okay. I mean, can I? Yeah, yeah. Go for it. [laughs] There you go. Good luck. Woah... Thank you! You're welcome. Where should we start, Aunt Hannah? Me? Um, uh, maybe we start in town hall? Hot apple dumplings! No calories. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, Carol. I need to ask you somethin'. So, Kevin and I thought it might be a good idea to keep this safe. Oh... So we were hoping that maybe you would let us keep it over here. We'll find room, of course. Oh! What's this? Looks like a... It's a... it's a... Looks like it's a letter to Santa. Maybe it got stuck under there. It's... it's old, though. You gonna read it? Well... I mean, that's someone's Christmas wish. Yeah? I would definitely open it. Looks like it's already open. Well, well, yeah, it's open, but it's a matter or not whether we read it or we don't. All in favour? Come on. Okay, alright... Let's see... It's typed, and it's dated. That's... that's 25 years old! That's been in that store that long. Wow. Okay. It says "Dear Santa, tis year I ust want a Chr..." Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, it looks like some of the letters didn't work very well on the typewriter. The... the H and the J. Right. Uh, okay, so let me try this again. Okay. "Dear Santa, this year I just want Christmas like "it used to be. "I'm sure you know it's been a tough year. "It would be nice to have Christmas like it used to be, "with the candles and the carols and the bells. "This Christmas, just this once, "I want it to go back to the way it was. "Best wishes, K.M." Who's K.M? Kevin Miller. Shop's looking good they say. So is that. Why thank you Kevin. And, um, the ca-- uh, candles and the carols and the bells. What is that talking about? That's all the stuff we used to do in the town, and before Daisy was the main Christmas event planner, Ruth Miller was. And Ruth Miller is... ...was. Kevin's mom. And his letter never made it to Santa. No, it didn't. I'm usually out managing a job until just before Christmas, so... Oh, hey guys! Oh, hey. Hey. What is all this stuff? Every year at the Christmas festival, we have a local arts and crafts fair. Yeah, and we bring all of our stuff down here before we set up the booths. Like these... are my hats! [laughs] Cute. That's nice. There's a lot of good stuff in here. (Hannah) Hmm-Mm. This is one of the oldest buildings in Evergreen. I've tried the key on all the locks. So far, nothing. Hmm. Wow. Oh. Beautiful. Yeah. Daisy always wanted to get these bells working again. Uh, my dad tried for a while. Nobody knows exactly what's wrong with the mechanism. C'mon Aunt Hannah. Let's go see if the people at the bank know. See you guys later. See you guys. Bye. You know, you said you were born here. Do you remember the bells ringing? -Oh, it was so long ago. -Yeah. It's all hazy. We moved around to so many towns, I mean, they kind of all blend together. However, I do remember Evergreen the most. Yeah, I remember the snow globe, and the mailbox. I remember Daisy. Ah yeah, Daisy, she's the one who took over all the Christmas planning and the festival after my mom... Mmm. Let's, uh, let's get these wreathes hung, huh? Sooner we get back to the store, get it done, the sooner we can get on with our lives. Sure. I just need to make one more stop. Okay. Thank you, ladies. [chattering] Oh! What's going on in here? Oh, wow! Oh, it smells so good in here. Woah, that's a lot of cookies! Yeah! [laughs] Wanna help us? I don't think we have time. Oh, well, actually, I have to ask you a question, Megan. Um, but Kevin here I'm sure would like to help. [laughs] Sure. I like your... crown? Actually, no, no, um, it's a... It is a reindeer. Oh. A reindeer. Okay. Yeah, I am, uh, genuinely terrible at decorating cookies. Yeah. It would only be for a few days, I just want the store to have some Christmas decorations, you know. So what I would do is I'd put these and the garlands around the door. I mean, I have a lot of them, so you're welcome to take some. Thank you. You're welcome! [laughter] They're having a lot of fun in here without us. Okay, ready to go? Okay, should we head back? Yeah. Why would you do that? Ah, we still have a lot of painting and decorating to do. Isn't frosting cookies painting and decorating rolled into one? [all laugh] Okay, yeah, sure! I think he's got you there. All right, fine. We'll do three cookies each, then we get out of here.

Don't mind us, just stopping in. Hi everyone, this is... Nancy Reddinger. It's so good to meet you. [surprised] Oh! Hi! Hi. Nice to meet you. Um, you're just a bit early. [laughs nervously] Yes, and I'm sorry about that, but I wanted to make this decision before first quarter. I mean, new year, new decision. You know how it is. [all agree and laugh] [laughs] Know how it is. Solid. I like it. Sturdy frame, centre of town location. Hmm. Fresh pine smell. [sniffs] Oh, uh, we should... Yeah. ...Should get out of your way. I'll just be a few minutes. I usually get a sense of these things right away. Okay. Looks like she's still deciding. (Lisa) Anyone read lips? (Hannah) Mmm-hmm. Oh... I mean, she has to see the potential, right? This place is all potential. Hey! I'm kidding. We did great. This is so exciting. I mean, nobody can replace Daisy, but... Yeah, it sure would be fun to run into each other at the store again. Yes. Anything would be better than it being turned into a parking lot, or something big and bulky that changes the town forever. I mean, it's like what the letter said. "What Christmas used to be." Yeah. What ... what letter? Uh, well, Lisa found... was moving the mailbox, and she found... Yeah, yeah, and I was gonna mention this to you, but... uh... I found your letter. My letter? Well, I just assumed that it was from when you were a kid. Oh! Here comes Ezra. Unfortunately, she's not going to put in an offer. Did she say why? She said she loved the store. It just wasn't right for her. Well, you have another buyer, right? I'm afraid the other one dropped out. It's just too close to Christmas. (Carol) Oh, Joe. I was waiting for the right time to ask you about- No, I understand. This... thank you for this. You're welcome. Um. I, uh... Excuse me. You know, maybe it was too big of a job for the time that we had here, but... You know, Kevin and I just really wanted it to work. And now... And now you'll think of something, because you always do. So, cut to the chase and tell me about this guy you clearly have a crush on. [laughs] Oliver, I don't think I have a cr-- I do not have a crush, okay? I mean... Maybe it's... No, I do. I do. And I shouldn't. I mean, I don't live here, and he doesn't live here. I don't even know if he likes me! Well, have you asked him to do something? Maybe it's just the season. I'm all caught up in the... The Christmas of everything. Lisa, just ask him to do something with you. Something not work related. If he says yes, then he likes you. If he says no, he probably still likes you. Thank you for that very confusing advice, Oliver. [sighs] Ah. I just wish I knew what to do with this store. [phone beeps] Oh, uh, Lisa, I should get this. This is Polly. Aw, tell her I said hey... Wait a minute! Oliver! Oh! Oliver, you're brilliant! I appreciate how hard everyone tried to help, but it's just... it looks like we just don't have the resources to- I think I got us one more chance at a buyer! What? How? Who? Yeah, okay, well... well, first of all, slow down. Okay, so, my partner and I have this client named Polly. And Polly is looking to expand, so we've convinced her to come to Evergreen during the Christmas festival to look at the store. Oh, that's amazing, that's great! Before we get ahead of ourselves, I mean... there is still a lot of work to do to impress this woman. [sighs] Oh... I just wish we... I just... There's the snow globe. Please work. What did you wish for? Hold on, I thought we weren't supposed to tell our wishes. That's what people always say. Usually, just before they tell us what they wished for. So! Spill it! I wished for a new idea. And by the way, why don't people ever tell their wishes? I think that's kind of silly. If it's an important Christmas wish to you, I think you should just share it with people. That is why we write to Santa. Yeah, it's... wait a minute, what? Say that again? We tell Santa what we want. That's why we write him letters. That's why we write... Letters! Kevin's letter! [excitedly] That's it! The, the, the letter is the... is the key! We use this letter to sell the store! Wow, that snow globe works fast. So, like the candlelight processional? Yes, yes, yes, all of it, the... the candlelight processional, the carols, the, the bells, all of it. Everything that is in this letter, we use it. Christmas like it used to be. That's not going to be very easy to pull off. I mean, Daisy kept some of the things, but nobody did this like Ruth. I know... I know that. But I still think we have to try. And we can show Polly what Evergreen is really made of. Please tell me you're with me. [all cheer] Yes! Yes!!! Hey. Hey. Peppermint hot cocoa? Wow, you remembered! Thank you, that's very sweet of you. I'm a very sweet guy. [laughs] Oh... Okay, listen, I just want to go ahead and... Listen, listen. About yesterday, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I left really abruptly. No! It's not your fault... I- I heard about your plan. Use the old traditions to sell the store? Yeah? I wanna help. You do? Yeah. That's how Christmas is supposed to be in Evergreen. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. (Carol) There they are! Hannah, she's got a great idea about the letters to Santa mailbox. Go. So, we'll continue the tradition, and we'll set it up right here, on Main Street. That's brilliant! And then, once the store's up and running, we'll put it back in the store. Love it. I love it, that's a great idea. Oh, and what about the choir and the carolling? Oh, yeah. Oh, don't worry about that. That's my baby. We're gonna go set this up. Bye girls. All right. All right, I guess we should head on inside. You know, but first, there's um, there's one more thing. Ooh. Come with me. Mysterious. You're going to like this, come on. Yeah, I'll take a look, Kev. I've worked on these bells for years, I don't think we have all the parts. Yeah, but the letter said it... Shhh... What was that? Oh, um, uh, nothing. Um, just do the best you can, Henry. And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. Thank you so much for helping out with this. Well, there's nowhere else we'd rather be. Would you look at this! Daisy's old mailbox! Hey, Nick. You know Thomas, and... Of course I know David! He and Hannah came by the hardware store the other day. How's the search for the key going? Not great. We've tried just about everywhere. Well, keep trying. Sometimes the best way to solve a puzzle is to step back and wait. And then, a bell goes off in your head and everything makes sense. Yeah! That makes sense. Thomas, are you new to Evergreen? You know, trying to be. In fact, we're thinking about branching out the logging business, and setting up a place here in... in Evergreen. Really? He's been talking about it for the whole day. Wonderful. Keep up the good work. Putting the mailbox here is a wonderful idea. I'm sure that Santa will appreciate it. Bye, Nick. Okay, here we go... Let's see... Oh. "Thank you cards." Well, everyone deserves a "thank you card", especially Santa. Just a little crooked there, just... Oh, let me get it. Perfect. [sighs] Okay, pipe's all done, and now this is finished. Just gotta let it dry. (on the phone) No. That... No, that's okay. Uh. No, I appreciate it. Thank you, Shawn. Bye. Everything okay? It will be as soon as I find somebody to give us supplies. I mean, here's the thing. You know, I need things that would go in this store. Like, like pillows, and pretty little Santa Claus people, and stockings... [laughs] What are you laughing at? Oh, you. You uh, you really love this. Yeah! Yes, I do really love it. You know what I love about it? I love that you can take something that no one sees the potential in, and you can turn it into something beautiful, like we're doing to this store. That's amazing. I always see my job through this lens of, you know, what's not done yet. I always feel like I'm behind, just gettin' it done. You enjoy the process. Y'know, watching someone get so excited, well, I guess I've been ignoring the fact that that's the most interesting part. The potential. Yeah. Hey, uh, I've gotta run over to the inn and pick up a few things. Why don't you take a break and ride with me, and we'll get some dinner? I have a thing I have to do. Oh. I, no, uh, um... look, I'm late as it is, but rain check? Yeah. yeah. You should, you should go. Rain check? Yeah, yeah, fine. All right. Bye. [sighs] [classical music] ♪ [classical music] ♪ Hello, how are you all doing? Having fun? Enjoy! -Cheers! -Cheers everyone! Hey! Hey! You're just in time, dinner's ready! Oh, great! Oh! Come with me for a sec. Let's put up some decorations. Okay... Aww. You're doing this all alone? Aw, everybody loves decorating a tree, I'm sure any one of those guests in there would love to help you. Which reminds me, I should check on the new guest. He's just arrived from Boston. Oh. He figured I could use a little R&R while helping out a friend. [screams excitedly] Oliver! What are you doing here? I mean, hey, what's Christmas without my bestie? Aww... Megan, this is Oliver. Yes, we've met, but he didn't tell me he knew you! I live for surprises. I know you do. [laugh] Oh! Excuse me a second. Aww, here. Help me decorate. Yeah, sure. There you go. Well, you got here fast! Ah, well there's a shockingly adorable little train that leads right into Evergreen. Yeah, I know the one. [chuckles] Plus, you said you needed help, so... Oh, Oliver, I do. The shelves are completely bare, I mean, the decorations look amazing. You know me, I can stage a store with no merchandise at all, but this is Polly we're talking about here. You know, she's gonna expect, like... Wow. This is gorgeous. They are, aren't they? Yeah. She's going to expect stuff like that, like handmade. And... You know what you are? What? You're brilliant...

I wanted to have dinner with you. I promised. You are full of surprises, Mr. Miller. I, I know. It's... it's ridiculous. No, it's handsome. [flustered] It's, uh, cute, uh, no. Hey. Hi. Hi; I'm Oliver. I work with Lisa in Boston. Right. And all over. Yes, you do. And this is... Kevin. I, I, I work with Lisa, here. [laughs] Hey, guys, come here. So, I had an idea. Do you remember the other day When you brought me downstairs to the basement and there were those boxes with the arts and crafts for the Christmas festival? Oh yeah, now that we moved everything to town square, we're barely finding space for all the booths. Okay... What if we put it all in Daisy's store? Give the appearance of an actual store, with customers. Yeah, we feature local artisans. It's great. Love it! We have quilters, we have ornament makers, we even have a maple syrup sugar shack in town. Well, someone show me these boxes. You got it. Come on! Awesome, great idea. -Bye. -Bye. Um, so I guess we should just... Nah, I should head back to the store. Oh. Oh yeah. Then I'll... Yeah, I'll uh, I'll see you later. Okay. How's that key search going? We've tried everywhere. He's right, I'm starting to think that key doesn't go to anything in Evergreen. Don't lose heart. I'm sure you're closer than you think. See ya, see ya later. Thanks a lot for coming to see our choir. We're actually a lot better in performance than we are in rehearsal. You are very good in rehearsal. Yeah, you know it's nice to have an audience. You know, it changes things up, so you hear things differently. If you ever want to come... -see us perform another time, that would be good. I mean, it might be something... That. Exactly that. Do you think this is going too fast? I feel like it's moving too fast. What do you think? I think, uh... this feels nice. We can go whatever pace you like. Hey, so you didn't take the job. I didn't. I want to open a store with you in Boston. [laughs] I mean, sure I've always wanted to work for a big company like Julia Weiz Lifestyle or even Polly's company but nah, you and I are a team. Oh, are you sure? Of course, I'm sure. I mean, I've always been the one who wanted to open the store and you've... you've gone along with it. I'm going to be honest with you. I've been thinking here lately that you're right. I mean, but the thing is... is we start a store we've got to stop and put down roots and you know how I am. It's just always been hard for me to do. So, what changed? Well, it's not just this town. It's the people. It sounds crazy, but it feels like magic to me. It feels like home. And then there's... [together] Kevin. Oh. Am I that obvious? Just a little. I mean, he's smart, and he's driven, and he's super talented. [laughs] And he makes me laugh. On more than one occasion. Oh! You do love that. Yeah, I do love that. [laughs] You know, I mean, it'd be different if I was going to be in one place for more than a while, but... You're still holding on to that "grab a bag and go" thing, huh? I'm just not sure I'm ready to stop travelling. Well, no, I mean, we have some time. We have a good amount of savings, but Boston is definitely more expensive than other places. Yeah, Boston is more expensive, but I mean... -Hey! -Hey! I was just coming over to see... I finished working on the floor, it needs to dry overnight. So until then, there's nothing more to do. Oh, well... I thought we were gonna do that later. And Oliver and I could've helped you. Nah, you do your thing. How's Oliver settling in? Oh, it's taking him a minute to get used to a small town, but yeah, he's okay. No, he's good, he's good. Extra pair of hands never hurts. Yeah. Hey! Do they call it the Kris Kringle Kitchen all year round, or do they change that during the summer? Ah, well, they put little shorts on the Santa Claus sign in the summer. It's a bit of a wedding destination. Ah, tourist towns know what they're doing. [laughs] Yeah. Oh, uh, Kevin said that since we don't have access to the store, that we should go to the ice skating pond. I don't remember saying anything like that. There's an ice skating pond? (Lisa) I knew you would love that. Where is it? It's just over the bridge. What are we doing just standing here? Do they rent skates? Yeah. Let's go. Meet you there. Oh, okay. See you there. See you guys. Why don't you come along? Walk with me. Sure. Looking good, David. I'm really glad you and my brother seem to be getting closer. Yeah... you sure? I mean, it's not like weird or anything for you? Why would it be weird? I've never seen you this happy. Either of you, in fact. Whoo! Hey guys. Hey Michelle. Come skate with us! Yeah. Oh, go ahead. We got the cocoa covered. But don't... Don't expect any fancy moves outta me. [laughs] I'm gonna do my best. Come on, we got you. I'm not really good at this! (David) We got you. (Michelle) Oh, thank you. (Kevin) This is where I learned to skate when I was a kid. (Lisa) Really? (Kevin) Yeah. It's a pretty special place. (Lisa) Yeah. Here's a good view. [gasps] [laughs in awe] Oh! It's gorgeous. Wow. What? It's just... the way you look at this town. You see the best of it. It's nice. Well, Hannah told me that people have been skating on this pond for over a hundred years, so... what's not to love about that, right? Come on down! The ice is warm! [laughing] (Lisa) Yeah, bronze medal. It seems like you two, um... have got it all figured out, huh? Well, I mean, we do share a brain. [laughs] It's kind of like, when you spend that much time with someone, I guess, you just start to form a pretty solid team. Yeah, it must be nice. Every job I take, I get this whole new crew of guys. Takes work to catch up. Yeah, and you have to find a new place to get supplies. Plus, living out of a suitcase. Ugh. Laundromats. Yes. Staying single the whole time. You know, Oliver and I are always complaining about being single. Wait, what? What? You, you and Oliver aren't... a, a thing? No! [laughs] No. Oh... Oh, I guess I just thought... No, we're not "a thing." No. Oh, look, we are... we are best friends. But that's... that's where it ends. Okay, well I... I guess instead of jumping to conclusions, I... Should've gotten the whole story? Yeah. It's embarrassing. It is. It is embarrassing... for one of us. And that is why I'm going to save you right now and ask you to skate. I would love to.

It just feels... it feels like home. You did that. You're welcome. So, does this mean that you've given more thought to Thomas's offer of staying here instead of going to Maine? Uh, I don't know. I... I mean, I love this town. I just, I'm not sure exactly what's here for me. [clears throat] Well, I mean, what if there was something here for you? What if... somebody that you wanted to spend Christmas with? Then, um... Yeah. Are, are you... Are you thinking about it? Maybe. I don't know, maybe. [laughs] Maybe a little. [door chimes] Merry Christmas! Hey. Merry Christmas. I came looking for some candles for the processional. Yeah, yeah, I, I actually saw some in there yesterday. Of course you did, because Daisy would never let me down. Where were we? [door chimes] Maybe we should consider taking that bell down. Maybe. Wow! It looks so good in here, guys! Thank you.

Still coming through in a pinch. Wow. You really do think of everything. [laughs] More like overthink. You know, I'm a little scared that maybe, once you get to know me more, that... Hey, listen. None of what you feel worries me, Michelle. You think I don't spend a lot of time worrying, and thinking about the complications? And I'd like to still keep getting to know you, Michelle. Either way. I like you. I like this. David, I have something for you. Nick wanted me to give this to you. Woah. Thank you! You're welcome. Does it have a remote? Oh, no, I don't think it has a remote. It's pretty old. I think they worked a little bit differently back then. [door chimes] Polly! Oh, Lisa! This store's absolutely gorgeous! I love it!

I remember you. We were... We were both there at the same time? Wait a minute, wait, I'm confused. So, you did, you did all this, with the store and the festival, because of the letter? It was you. You swept in here, and... For the first time in a while, I got back a piece of what Christmas used to be. [laughs] And then when I read the letter and I realized it was from my dad, it was more of a reason. This was all your doing, son? Dad. I wrote that letter 25 years ago. When the townspeople... they brought your mother back. Preparing the candlelight procession and the choir. I just wanted you to have what you asked for in the letter. You did. You did. You did, son. You did. You both did. [laughs] Thank you. You're so welcome. ♪ There it is! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Allie. Merry Christmas. [bells tolling] Are those church bells?
