(Upbeat music) (Traffic roars) (Dramatic music) (Group mumbles) (Dramatic music) - What's the matter with you? - Mary, Mary! - What are you talking about? - Mary's dead. - Mary's dead? I can't believe it. - You killed her, ah! - [Frankie] You're crazy! (Dramatic music) (Grunts) (Dramatic music) - If you ever come near my house again, if I ever see you again, I'll kill you, I swear it. (Soft, dramatic music) (Groans) (Soft, dramatic music) (Soft, upbeat music) - (Doorbell chimes) - The first time I saw Mary, I knew there had to be trouble. Maybe it was the way she looked, like a startled child when she saw me, I don't know. All I can remember is that even then I wanted to take her in my arms. - Yes? - Hello. - Is Bob home? - No, what is it? - I'm Frankie. - Frankie? - Bob's brother. - Oh, of course. I'm Mary. - Won't you come in? - Thanks. - [Mary] This will be a wonderful surprise for Bob. (Soft, upbeat music) Do sit down, can I get you something to drink? - No, thanks, but I am tired. I've been traveling all day. - You'll stay for dinner, won't you? - Well, I don't know. - Do stay, Bob will be so happy to see you. - I'm anxious to see Bob too, it's been a long time. - [Mary] I think that's all Bob ever talks about, you. - [Frankie] Well, I hope he didn't tell you the truth about me, but I will tell you this, he didn't write much about you or I would've been here sooner, much sooner. - Oh, now really? - I mean that. - [Mary] Do stay for dinner, please. - I don't wanna be any bother. - Bob would be absolutely furious if I didn't insist that you stay. - In that case, all right. Bob did okay. You're quite a dish. I never expected this from the old boy. He's a sly one. - [Mary] Bob will be home any minute now, I better finish preparing dinner. - Will you excuse me? - Sure. (Soft, upbeat music) - So that's Frankie. He's so different from Bob. Doesn't seem possible that they're brothers. He seems so exciting. So he would never let life pass him by. So everything he touches becomes alive. I'm glad he's here. And yet, somehow I'm sorry. What's the matter with me? I'm acting like a silly school girl. - Bob seems to be doing pretty well. It's a nice place he has here. I've been away for two years, traveling around the country, selling factory equipment. During that time, my brother Bob had gotten married. Bob, a married man, it was hard to believe. When he wrote and told me the news, he didn't say too much about Mary, his wife and I hadn't expected to find this little beauty. (Soft music) - Mary I'm home. (Soft, upbeat music) Hello, Frankie, you old son of a gun. - [Frankie] Bob, it's good to see you. - How have you been? You look great, this is a surprise. - You look pretty good yourself. - How long do you expect to stay? - Oh, I don't know. I was just passing by passing. - Passing by nothing. It's been two years, Frankie. I won't take no for an answer. Now that you're here, you're gonna stay. - [Frankie] You haven't changed a bit, still my big brother Bob, looking after little Frankie. - Come on, let's get comfortable. It's been a long day. You've met Mary, of course? Isn't she great? - [Frankie] She sure is. - I knew you'd like her. - Dinner's ready. - Okay, honey. Come on. (Soft music) Sit down, here. Mary, will you bring the scotch? We'll have a toast. (Soft, upbeat music) Here's to two people I love best in the world, my wife, Mary (soft music) And my brother, Frankie. (Soft music) Well, boy, what are your plans? - Oh, I don't know. I really haven't thought much about what I'm going to do. - You're not a kid anymore. - Well, I know that. - You should settle down. - Well. - Get married. You can take my word for it, there's nothing like it. Isn't that right, Mary? - [Frankie] Maybe for you, Bob. - [Bob] Don't you agree with me, Mary? - Of course. - Marriage is not for me, you know that. - Well, I used to think that way too. Now, if anything happened to Mary, why look kid, why don't you stay in town? - Well. - Get a job. - I can't stay put. - I'll speak to Mr. Norris. - I'll see. - I'm sure he can use you at the plant. - [Frankie] I'll have to think about it, I just don't know. - [Bob] By the way, I met an old friend of yours the other day, zena, she's still in town. - Really? How is she, anyway? - [Bob] Fine, fine. She wanted to know all about you. I told her I hadn't heard from you for quite some time. - Good old zena, we had some great times together. - What about food, Mary? (Soft, upbeat music) Pretty good meal, huh? - Sure was, food was really great. The best I've had in a long time. - [Bob] Frankie, I wish you'd stay here with us. We have an extra room. - Are you sure that I won't be putting you out? - Of course not. It'll be wonderful having you with us, Frankie. I really mean it. Tired, huh? - I had a rough day. - I bet. Come on, why don't you turn in? - [Frankie] Okay, Bob. - I'll show you to your room. - Right. - Come on this way. (Soft, upbeat music) Well? - Say, this is nice. - Take it easy for a few days. And when you decide just what you wanna do, we can sit down and talk about it, what do you say? Is it a deal? - [Frankie] It's a deal. - [Bob] Unpack and get a good night's sleep. You really look tired. - I am tired, I'm beat. - It gets pretty cold at night, so I brought you another blanket. - Hey, I almost missed the TV wrestling matches. See you in the morning, Frankie, goodnight. - You can put your things in that chest. - Okay, thanks. - Here, I'll help you. Unpacking seems to be a woman. (Dramatic music) - What's the matter? I have a permit for that gun. It's a souvenir from my army days. - [Mary] Oh. - [Frankie] Traveling around the country at night by car - can be dangerous. - Yes, I suppose so. Well. - [Bob] Mary, where's today's TV guide? - Please excuse me. (Soft, upbeat music) - That Mary really has class. She's quite a gal. Now just what could she have seen in (indistinct) Old Bob? You can't possibly have that much money, enough to make a girl like Mary marry. He had nothing when I left town two years ago, I just can't figure it. But I guess I never will understand women. This is not a bad setup for me. I can stay here for a couple of weeks, take it easy, eat and sleep, just like a paid vacation. And with a little loving on the side. That is if I can make Mary see that she didn't start living until she met me. It shouldn't be too hard to convince her. She sure looks bored. (Laughs) (Soft music) So zena's still in town. Now that's a girl for you. She's got everything and a little bit more, the kind of a dame a fella never forgets, no, sir. I guess she thinks I gave her a pretty dirty deal. And maybe I did, but what's a fella gonna do when all the chips are down? - I'm scared. I don't know why, but I am. I wish he'd go away. No I don't, I want him to stay. Every time he looks at me, every time I meet his eyes, I feel as though he's undressing me, undressing me. (Crowd chatters) (Laughs) (Upbeat music) (Crowd chatters) - [Zena] Hey, take it easy, lil. (Upbeat music) - [Female] Hey zena, what's with you? This is your party, remember? Why don't you join it? - Stop your kidding. Somebody's got to stay sober. (Dramatic, upbeat music) (Doorbell rings) (Soft music) Hello. - Hi. - [Zena] Well. - Can I come in? - Why not? Come on in. (Upbeat, dramatic music) - I see you're having a party. - Just some friends. (Upbeat, dramatic music) - I wanna talk to you. (Soft music) I missed you, zena. - You did, huh? I'll bet you did. - [Frankie] I mean it, kid, honest. - Oh, sure. - You've gotta believe me, zena. Jeez, zena, I couldn't help it, I had to leave town. - [Zena] Don't touch me. This time I'm not falling for anything you say. - We had some good times together, didn't we? Come on baby. You know that I'm crazy about. (Soft music) - If I had any sense, I wouldn't have let you come through that door. (Soft, upbeat music) Oh, frank. (Soft, upbeat music) - [Frankie] All the time I was away, I couldn't get you outta my mind. (Soft, upbeat music) I had to see you. You're the only reason I came back to this crummy little town. - Honest Frankie? - Yeah, baby. - [Zena] I never did have the willpower to stay away from you. (Soft, upbeat music) - Hi, hi babe. (Soft, upbeat music) - [Mary] Stop it. Stop it, I say. I'll tell Bob, he'll. - [Frankie] You won't tell Bob. You're too smart for that. Besides he wouldn't believe you. (Slap sounds) (Soft music) (Soft, dramatic music) - Bob? - Huh? - Do you think I'm pretty? - Oh yeah, sure. - Do you think I have a beautiful body? - Oh sure. - Why don't you tell me I'm pretty? Look at me. Why don't you make love to me? We're married. I'm your wife, remember? - What's the matter with you? - [Mary] Bob, listen to me. - Are you all right? - I'm 23 years old. When I go to bed with my husband and when he's feeling affectionate, he kisses me on my cheek of course. - [Bob] Mary, what is it? Mary you must be sick, I'm worried about you. - [Mary] How's that for loving? For living? And when I'm 25 and when I'm 30, you won't even kiss my cheek, will you, my great lover? - What is the matter, Mary? - I'm beautiful, I really am. Don't you want me? - Mary are you sick? - Yes, I'm sick. Sick for want of affection, sick because there's no one to love me. I cry myself to sleep at night, did you know that? I've never known another man and I hunger for the caresses of my husband, my body cries out for his love. - Mary. - Oh. Where must I go for love? Where? Don't you understand that I want to be loved? - [Bob] I can't figure you out. Maybe you'd better see Dr. Brown tomorrow. - [Mary] What's the use? (Soft music) - You're beautiful. I know this had to be. (Soft music) - [Mary] I never thought it could be like this. This is what I've been waiting for. This is what I've been yearning for. (Soft music) Bob? - Yes? - How long is your brother Frankie going to stay here? - Why? - Oh, I don't know, just wondering. - What's the matter Mary, don't you like Frankie? He's a nice kid. Don't you think so? - Yes, of course I do. - I'm not much company for you and I thought you'd be glad I have someone like Frankie around. - [Mary] No, Bob, I really don't need anyone, but you. - Are you ready, Bob? - Okay, boy, let's go. - Will you be back soon? - Yes, see you later. (Soft, upbeat music) So long. (Soft, upbeat music) How does it feel to be back in your old hometown? - [Frankie] Well, everything is the same. Nothing has changed, as though I never left the place. - [Bob] I know just what you mean, but it's home to me. I have everything I want right here. Wonderful wife, good job, nice home. A man doesn't have a right to ask for anything more. - [Frankie] I'd say it depends upon a man, wouldn't you? - [Bob] I guess you're right. - [Frankie] Hey Bob, you're taking the long way, aren't you? - [Bob] Well, that's right, but I wanted to talk to you. - [Frankie] This is center park, isn't it? I spent plenty of afternoons here when I played hooky from school. - [Bob] Oh, I know what you mean. We all go through that period. I used to come here with a book and read until it got too dark for me to see. And mom would think I was in school studying, always made me feel guilty. Those were the good old days. - [Frankie] Yep. - [Bob] Pretty here, isn't it? Gee, Frankie here, I wish you'd forget that traveling job of yours. Stay here, settle down and make a life for yourself. You gotta make roots some place. - [Frankie] I don't know, I haven't decided yet. - [Bob] Well, take your time. I'm sure you'll see it my way. Just remember my home is yours. Stay as long as you like. - [Frankie] Thanks Bob. But that could be a very long time. - Ah, go on, now we'll see how good you are. (Soft, upbeat music) Well, that's the table I always use, the place is kind of empty. But in an hour it'll really be packed. (Upbeat music) (Balls clatter) (Upbeat music) Good shot. - [Frankie] Not bad, huh? I haven't played since I left town, that's more than two years ago. (Upbeat music) - [Bob] Frankie, you don't know what it means to me to have you here. (Soft music) (Upbeat music) Hi, honey. - How about some coffee? - All right. - That sounds good. - I'm going to change. - [Mary] Frankie, you must leave here. - [Frankie] You don't mean that, do you? - [Mary] No. (Soft, upbeat music) - Zena? Zena are you home? - Wait, I'll be through in a minute. (Soft music) - Hi, zena. - Hello, handsome. (Soft music) - [Frankie] Zena, I'm crazy about you. (Soft, upbeat music) I've never felt like this about anyone. (Soft music) Honey, how about a drink? - [Mary] I'll just take my coat off and fix one for you. (Soft music) - [Frankie] I guess by now, you know what I take? - [Mary] I sure do. - [Frankie] Well, it looks as though I'll have to start thinking about getting back to work. That means traveling again. I've decided the road is for me. I hate to leave you, Mary. I feel terrible just thinking about how much I'll miss you, but I'm in pretty bad shape financially and a fella has to live. - This needs some ice. (Soft music) - [Frankie] What's matter, Mary? Why so quiet? - You're not saying a word. - Oh? You see, I just never thought about you leaving here. I don't know how I can stay here without you. You've become such an important part of my life. The most important part, I guess. I suppose I should have known that one day you would go away, alone, without me, but I just didn't wanna think about it. Maybe I thought that not thinking about it would keep it from happening. Can you understand that Frankie? - [Frankie] Sure, sure, I know what you mean, Mary. - [Mary] For the first time in my life I'm happy, for the very first time. - [Frankie] She kidding? You know, I'm not gone because I want to. - Well then why go? - [Frankie] Well I have to, I'm down to my last dollar. - Maybe I can help you. - Yeah? (Soft music) - [Mary] Tell me you love me, Frankie. - [Frankie] I love you, Mary. - Honest? - Honest. - [Mary] Then nothing else matters. (Soft, jazzy music) Frankie, don't go away. - [Frankie] How would you like to go with me? - [Mary] Oh, how could I? - We could get married. - Married? - Oh, Frankie. - Sure. We can go to Mexico. You can get a quick divorce and then watch this stop us. - Do you really mean it? - Sure. - [Mary] When could we leave? - [Frankie] Well, it's just a matter of money. We have to live, you know. Then there's the divorce of course, so that we can get married. We need money for that. - [Mary] I know, but we'll work it out somehow, you'll see. (Soft, jazzy music) (Dramatic music) (Soft, upbeat music) - [Zena] You sure were stoned last night, lil. - [Lil] I know, it was real nice of you to ask me to spend the night with you, I don't think I could have made it home. You were a real friend, zena. - [Zena] Ah you'd do the same for me, I'm sure. - Right. - And besides what are friends for? (Soft, upbeat music) I never thought you'd ever sober up. (Soft, upbeat music) - [Lil] And neither did I, frankly, but I feel great now. Oh golly, I really do. (Laughs) (Soft, upbeat music) Hey, I think Frankie's hanging around here again. You sure go for him, don't you? Well, as they say, to each his own. - That's right, lil to each his own. (Soft, upbeat music) (Upbeat music) - [Frankie] Mind if I join you? (Soft music) Why so glum? - [Mary] Frankie, I can't go on like this, hiding and scared. If only we could be together, just the two of us. - If I had the money Mary, I'd take you away tomorrow. - [Mary] Frankie. - We'd go to Mexico and get married like I said. - Frankie. - What's the use of wishing. Where would I get any money? - I can get some money. - [Frankie] You can get money? Where? - [Mary] Well, Bob and I have a joint savings account at the center bank. - [Frankie] What's in it? - We saved $2,000. - [Frankie] 2000 isn't much, but it'll help. - I can't take all of it. It wouldn't be fair. - Then forget it. (Soft music) $2,000 is little enough. If you're gonna split it, then just forget it. - No, don't go. I'll take all of it. I'll take the $2,000. (Soft music) - Oh, that's my baby. That's a smart girl. (Soft music) - [Mary] Frankie, when are we going away? When are we leaving? - Soon, very soon. - Oh. (Soft music) - [Frankie] Of course we can't leave without the money, the $2000. - [Mary] I know, I'll get it, it's just Bob. - [Frankie] Be careful. It wouldn't do for Bob to find out about us now. Be careful, but get the money. (Soft music) - [Mary] Frankie? You know, I've never really been in love before. - [Frankie] What about Bob? - [Mary] He was so good to me and I was so lonely. You don't know how kind Bob has been to me. (Soft music) That's what makes it so difficult for me - to hurt him like this. - He'll get over it. - [Mary] Oh, I hope so. Honestly, I do. (Upbeat music) - Wait. I'll get into something more comfortable, okay? (Soft, upbeat music) - Hi baby. (Soft music) - Frankie. - What's the matter baby, what is it? - Well, it's my cousin, della. - Della? - Yes, Frankie. - Who's della? I don't think I know her. - No, you never met her. - [Frankie] Well, what about della? - [Zena] I'm spending the weekend with her. - You mean I won't see you for two days? - [Zena] That's right. Lately I've been kind of scared of della. - Tell me. - No, I don't wanna talk about it. What about the $2,000 you were going to get so that we can get out of this (indistinct)? - [Frankie] I'll have it real soon. Then we'll get out town. You can forget all about della and I can get away from Mary. - Who's Mary? - Someday, I'll tell you all about her. Right now, let's not talk anymore. (Soft music) - This is a terrible thing that we're doing to Bob. Please understand. - What Bob doesn't know won't hurt him, besides he's old enough to be your father. And a dull one at that. You never should have married him. You know that. You think too much. Mary, what about the money? I can't hang around here much longer. Are you going to get it? - [Mary] Yes, yes, I'll get it. - [Frankie] Good, that's what I want to hear. - [Mary] You don't know how I hate to do this to Bob. It's been wonderful having you here all weekend. Oh, there's the door, it must be Bob. (Soft music) (Upbeat, quirky music) (Upbeat music) - Some mail for you, here. - Frankie? Frankie? (Upbeat music) - Oh, what's this? A pamphlet about Los Angeles. - [Zena] Dear Frankie, when you read this letter, I'll be on my way to Los Angeles. I had to leave town. I had to get away from della and I just couldn't wait until you got the $2,000. I'll be at the colbit hotel on main street. If you get the money, meet me there. But if you don't, just forget it, I won't be there. Like I said before, without money, you're without zena. Of course, if you're as crazy about me, as you say you are, if I'm in your blood, you'll get the money somehow, zena. (Soft music) - Frankie? - What do you want? - I wanna talk to you. Why are you so afraid? You look so pale, are you sick? - [Frankie] Oh no, I'm alright. - What's the matter with you? Why are you avoiding me? - [Frankie] Say, I don't know what you mean. - Yes, you do. Frankie, I can't go on like this. - [Frankie] But what do you want me to do? - You do love me, don't you? - How many times do I have to tell you that? I love you. - [Mary] Please, please tell me. I love you so much, Frankie, I can't live without you. - I love you. - [Mary] And we'll go away together as we planned. - [Frankie] Just as soon as you get that $2,000, we'll leave here. - [Mary] We'll never be apart after that, will we Frankie? - [Frankie] No, never, but I can't wait for that money much longer. - [Mary] Oh, we'll be so happy. You'll see, I told you, I never loved anyone before. - [Frankie] I know, I know. (Soft, dramatic music) I have to go now, I have an appointment. - [Mary] But there's so much we have to talk about. - [Frankie] Okay, then meet me at our bench in the park in an hour, see you later. (Soft, dramatic music) - She's so young, she cried out for love, for life, but I didn't listen. I pretended not to hear her. Now she's leaving me and I'm without love, without life. I'll let her go, I'll tell her so and she can take the money. Without her I don't need it, I don't need anything. My own brother. (Soft, upbeat music) - Hello, Tom. - Hi. - [Frankie] Only have time for one game, I have to meet some dame but I'll be back as soon as I can get rid of her. - [Tom] Okay, don't be too long. (Soft music) (Pool ball sounds)? - Well? - Don't be angry with me, I have to talk to you. - All right, so talk, I'm listening. - You promised we'd go away together. - [Frankie] And you promised you get the $2,000. This is it, I'm leaving town alone. - [Mary] No, Frankie, you said you'd take me with you. - I would, if you got the $2000 I told you before, I haven't any money. - [Mary] But I have, I took the money out of the bank. - You did? - Yes. - [Frankie] Well, how much money did you take? All of it? - Yes, all of it, $2,000. - [Frankie] Where is the money? - I have it at home. - We'll go to Mexico. - When Frankie, when? - As soon as I can make arrangements. - Oh Frankie, I'm so happy. - Good. - I have some personal matters to take care of. It should take me about a week, okay? - How's that? - A week? Oh, I don't know if I can wait that long. (Soft music) (Birds chirp softly) I can get my divorce and we can be married right away. Isn't it wonderful? - [Frankie] Yeah. Today is Wednesday the second, suppose we leave for Mexico next Tuesday. - [Mary] Next Tuesday? That would be the eighth. (Upbeat music) (Birds chirp) - [Frankie] I'll need all of the money for the tickets and other expenses. - [Mary] Of course. Just as soon as you get home, I'll give you the 2000. - [Frankie] It's just a loan, of course. I'll pay it back. (Sighs) What's wrong? - [Mary] Poor Bob. - [Frankie] I have to go to town, I'll see you later. Have the money for me so that I can get started with the arrangement. - Yes, Frankie. - When you get home, you can put my things together so we can begin packing. - [Mary] But you have all week to pack. - [Frankie] I know, but I'd like to get started. - All right. Oh, Frankie, I love you so much. I couldn't live without you. (Soft music) Next week at this time, I can't believe it, I'll never ask for anything again. Married to Frankie, married to the man I love. We have so many things to take care of. We have so many plans to make. But I just wanna sit here and daydream. I know I'm doing a terrible thing to Bob. Maybe someday he'll understand. Maybe someday he'll forgive me. (Soft music) No, no, it can't be, it is impossible! (Soft, dramatic music) Why Frankie? Why? (Soft, dramatic music) How could you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? You were my life. You were everything to me. But now, now there's nothing. Nothing. (Soft music) (Soft, dramatic music) How do I go on? What do I do? (Soft, dramatic music) This must be a bad dream. If it is, I don't want to awaken. (Dramatic music) (Gun shot sounds) (Dramatic music) - Mary! Oh my god! (Dramatic music) - I suppose I should have kept away from her. She is, was my brother's wife. (Dramatic music)
