presents Film restored in 1998 using an intermediary from an original incomplete nitrate negative and a Dutch fragment in the Cin?math?que. An Argentinian 16mm intermediary was also used in this as yet incomplete reconstruction. In 2013, the Cin?math?que attempts a 2K digital restoration of Prot?a by adding tints from the Dutch nitrate copy. Tinting was also informed by the original negative, not taken into account originally. The typography of the Francis Lacassin cards was reworked according to the ?clair intertitles from 1913 found on various copies. At Gottenberg, Messenia's capital, police prefect Baron Nyborg receives news of considerable diplomatic importance. Kingdom of Messenia Ministry of Foreign Affairs To Baron Nyborg, Police Prefect Sir, We have learned from a reliable source that Celtia and Slavonia have just concluded a treaty contrary to our interests. We must obtain this document at all costs. M----- , Ministry of Foreign Affairs Baron Nyborg calls the only one capable of succeeding in such a difficult mission. Shrouded in mystery, a genius of spycraft... ...the famous adventurer Prot?a. Prot?a accepts, on one condition: Her jailed assistant The Eel must be freed. Some time later... The Eel doesn't enjoy being guarded, preferring unconditional freedom. The Prefect learns of The Eel's escape... In Gottenberg, the Ambassador of Slavonia, signer of the secret treaty with Celtia... Mr. Ambassador - Baron Nyborg has hired Prot?a to steal the document. She leaves Celtia on the Orient Express tomorrow evening. The Ambassador orders his secretary, Count Varallo, to take the Orient Express and to slow Prot?a's arrival, as well as alerting authorities. Prot?a and The Eel have spotted the man who is watching them... At the station buffet, Prot?a distracts Count Varallo. Despite his forced vacation, The Eel has not lost his touch... At Celtia's border, Prot?a and The Eel find treasure in Count Varallo's luggage... From: Ambassador of Slavonia To: Mr. Robertsau - Celtia Foreign Affairs Sir, Count Varallo, whom I've given a secret mission concerning your government will call to present his credentials. P------ Unable to prove diplomatic status, Count Varallo is arrested for contraband cigars and lace. In Metropolis, Celtia's capital... The Foreign Affairs Minister entrusts a copy of the treaty to his secretary for safekeeping. Meanwhile, in the Ministry's waiting room... That same night... The next day, after the watchman's report, M. Robertsau orders the precious document secured in a safe. He then prepares to receive an old woman with a petition... A gift sent from the Viceroy of Numidia is carried in. While The Eel completes the plan, Prot?a intercepts the Minister's aide. Mr. Chief Secretary: Entrust the document which is known to you to my aide. Despite his "aide's" orders, the Minister is awakened. The chloroform wears off earlier than planned. The Minister struggles in the crate and cries out. Meanwhile, Prot?a tries to obtain the treaty from the Minister's secretary. But Prot?a is not easily discouraged... Later at the Minister's ball... A Romany musician and her stylish servant prepare entertainments... Count Varallo, finally exonerated, will also be in attendance. Count Varallo warns the Minister he has recognized Prot?a among the musicians. The ruse has failed... ... but it is too late: The bird has flown away! The new Albanian Ambassador and his wife paid the price for this precipitous escape. Prot?a and The Eel mix with guests, and the party is a success. Suddenly... The "wife" faints. Her "husband" takes her to rest in the Minister's office. His safe is no match for The Eel's expert fingers. But all exits are guarded. To escape, the pair set a fire and disguise themselves as firefighters. Taking advantage of the distraction, they leave unnoticed. The treaty's disappearance causes massive police searches and interrogations. A policeman finds their hideout... Surprised, Prot?a and The Eel are tied to a bed. The policeman runs for backup, but the bed is rigged to fall through the floor with a disguise kit. They free themselves and adopt new disguises, escaping through a chimney next door. Police return for a rooftop chase, but the pair are much too agile, and police are thwarted. It would take much more to discourage Prot?a! A few days later, she buys a traveling circus. As a lion tamer, she'll be able to cross the border. The circus lacks a monkey, but The Eel knows how to do anything... Being true professionals, they practice their new roles. A good spy needs to master all vocations... At the Golden Pigeon Lodge, waiting for police operations to end... Breaking news: A theft has endangered the security of Celtia.

Inspector Max is determined to retrieve the treaty. But Sadie disagrees... Early in the morning, to build distance with pursuers, all means of transport are valid... The only bridge leading to the border... Prot?a having eluded her pursuers, now is the time for a reunion. A few hours later, at the last station before the border, the entire Celtian Army awaits Prot?a. On the train platform, two officers are unaccustomed to carrying their luggage... At the Good Pastor Inn... - Officers, you horses were just stolen! Excellent equestrians, "officers" Prot?a and The Eel gallop to the border, receiving all the respect their rank deserves. In Messenia, their welcome is not so warm. Mistaken for Celtian spies because of their uniforms, they are arrested. Meanwhile, in Metropolis, the Foreign Affairs Minister awaits the news of a promised capture. Much more was necessary to apprehend Prot?a!... Excellency, Using diabolical ruses and odious aggressions, the two spies have crossed into Messenia disguised as Celtian officers.
