A FILM BY YEON SANG-HO PART I If you saw me now, you'd think that I was in a tough situation, right? But I'm actually a lucky person. And there was no other choice but to go this far. HELL That's me not too long ago. Up to that point my life had been a boring routine. Not so great, but not so bad. I was an ordinary person shuttling back and forth between work and home. The kind of person who is invisible in the crowd at work. I was an ordinary person. Going to work in the morning and leaving work in the evening, then reading a magazine while drinking coffee with a lot of cream was my daily routine. The only unique thing about my routine was that I would stare at this calendar. It was a cheap calendar from the supermarket in front of our apartment, but this picture had a strange power. I wanted to know if that was a real place. Not everyone was indifferent to me. This person, Section Chief Hong, thought he could take out his anger on me just because I'm his subordinate. But I didn't really hold it against him because I'm not a sensitive person who cares about stuff like that. Then an angel appeared to me. Angels always do the same thing. They suddenly appear and tell you what is to come. I heard a story that someone at work saw an angel. - Hey... - Huh? Yesterday an angel appeared to me and told me all about my future marriage. An angel's prophecy always comes true. It simply states the facts about what is to come. But the angel's expression was unusual that day. You will die at 1:50 a.m. You are judged to be rank 3, so you are bound for the 2nd ring of Hell. And the agony of Hell is ten times as bad as the worst pain you have ever felt. Ten times as bad as I've ever felt? Ten times as bad as I've ever felt... When I was in high school I was hit by a car while riding my bike. I was knocked to the street covered in blood. I couldn't even lift a finger. I was in the hospital for half a month. Even the slightest movement would cause pain to shoot through every nerve in my body. But even more excruciating than that was the mind-numbing boredom. But ten times that much pain for an eternity... I was feeling hopeless. I wanted to ask why I had been judged so negatively. In 50 minutes the reapers would attack. I had to come up with a plan. I decided to run away. The reapers are controlled by a strict contract. I would run away from my home and take advantage of their confusion. And I would go far away and stay unnoticed and wait for my ranking to improve. How far did I run? All was quiet in the darkness before the dawn. And then... It was Section Chief Hong. Hong said an angel had appeared to him and prophesized that he was bound for Hell at 1:50 a.m. He said he was so scared that he ran away. It was a strange coincidence. I told him that I was in the same situation as he was. Hong apologized for his attitude toward me. But at this point that really wasn't important. Section Chief Hong and I fell into a long silence. Just what time is it anyway? This is my room. Their plans were unhindered. The pain that Section Chief Hong was now feeling was the pain that he would be feeling forever in Hell. They skinned Section Chief Hong alive. Section Chief Hong began to scream. And they began to beat me. The pain Section Chief Hong felt was conveyed to me through his screams. Do you realize that if you run away you will go to an even more painful Hell? I ended up rank 4, which is worse than rank 3. Section Chief Hong had already gone to Hell. Now it's your turn. A maddening fear overcame me. Then an angel appeared. Do you want to run away? But if you run away and get caught again your rank will go down even further and you will go to an even more painful Hell. Do you still want to run away? When I came to my senses I was in this place. Where is this place? And how much time has passed? It's never safe here, but the angel gave me a chance to escape. I've been plagued by nightmares. So far I've been able to narrowly escape them several times since then. But each time I'm torn between the relief that I've gotten away and the fear that I'll be going to an even more painful Hell. The fear causes me pain and torment. It's like Hell. They're coming. I have to run again. PART II You will die five days from now at 10:00 p.m. You have been judged to be rank 1 so you are bound for Heaven. HELL JAE-YEONG: They say that there is no pain in Heaven. When I was young I thought, "As long as people possess reason, can there ever be no pain at all?" But they say that there is no reason in Heaven. Five days from now I will completely cease to exist. Looking at the photos brings back vivid memories of my childhood. Like this... I remember this so clearly... The moment I go to Heaven, these memories will become nothing. 4 DAYS, 19 HOURS, 35 MINUTES, 2 SECONDS LEFT 4 DAYS, 19 HOURS, 35 MINUTES, 1 SECOND LEFT 4 DAYS, 19 HOURS, 35 MINUTES, 0 SECONDS LEFT 4 DAYS, 19 HOURS, 34 MINUTES, 59 SECONDS LEFT 4 DAYS, 19 HOURS, 34 MINUTES, 58 SECONDS LEFT 4 DAYS, 19 HOURS, 34 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS LEFT 4 DAYS, 19 HOURS, 34 MINUTES, 56 SECONDS LEFT Yeah, it's me.

How come you're away from the school on a weekday? You need to eat first, right? Go wash your hands and I'll make you something to eat. You didn't have a hard time getting here? Wow, the school still hasn't given you a raise? Any you're supposed to get married to Chang-gyun, - so you need to be saving money. - Mom, I'm dying in four days. Still... I'm glad you're not going to Hell. You... You've always been a good person. Have I? JAE-YEONG: Have I always been a good person? I have no idea. 2 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 11 MINUTES, 55 SECONDS LEFT 2 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 11 MINUTES, 54 SECONDS LEFT 2 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 11 MINUTES, 53 SECONDS LEFT 2 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 11 MINUTES, 52 SECONDS LEFT 2 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 11 MINUTES, 51 SECONDS LEFT 2 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 11 MINUTES, 50 SECONDS LEFT I have many memories of hurting a lot of people in my life... Those people... Have they just forgotten the hurt I caused them? If I've been a good person, why do I have to die so young? I've been happy up to now... More than Heaven... Should I sleep? Or should I not sleep? I'm about to sleep forever. So what should I do? I have to recall all my memories... Uh, like eating ramen noodles with my friends in the reading room... The time a classmate hit me over an eraser I'd taken... The time I snuck out to the movies with a friend in middle school... And that time I went on an errand for my mom... I got lost... 1 DAY, 14 HOURS, 1 MINUTE, 2 SECONDS LEFT 1 DAY, 14 HOURS, 1 MINUTE, 1 SECOND LEFT That was hard... 1 DAY, 14 HOURS, 1 MINUTE, 1 SECOND LEFT That was hard... 1 DAY, 14 HOURS, 1 MINUTE, 0 SECONDS LEFT 1 DAY, 14 HOURS, 0 MINUTES, 59 SECONDS LEFT And also-- 1 DAY, 14 HOURS, 0 MINUTES, 59 SECONDS LEFT And also-- 1 DAY, 14 HOURS, 0 MINUTES, 58 SECONDS LEFT What? You wanna break up? What are you saying all of a sudden? What's wrong? Tell me! Come on! I'm...going to die. What? What are you talking about? Explain! Fuck... This is bullshit! What's wrong? Calm down. What's wrong? I'm calm, so why aren't you? I'm not going to Hell, so what's wrong? It's not about whether you're going to Hell or Heaven! You think I don't know that? It's not like I don't know that... Please. Please don't. Don't even talk about it. Forget me. And just-- Forget? Can you forget me? Yes. I will forget you. Soon I'll forget all about you. I'll forget you, my mom, my friends, everything. So... Let's run away together. Are you crazy? If I actually run away because you said that, don't you know that I'll go to Hell and so will you? Take it back right now! Take it back, I said! I can't! I can't! Damn! JAE-YEONG: Chang-gyun said a horrible thing. "Let's run away together." Now if I run away instead of going to Heaven like I'm supposed to, Chang-gyun will go to Hell too. Chang-gyun has put even more of a burden on me now. It's just another burden on me when I'm trying to sort out my life. Goodbye. He probably can't accept a sudden breakup because he's in love with me. On the one hand, I'm grateful. Someone like that will surely remember me long after I'm gone. That way I won't disappear completely, right? TV: Then the landlord shouted, "Hey! Where are you gonna go at this hour?" In the end, I was only occupied with running away... JAE-YEONG: I thought five days wouldn't be enough time to sort out my life. But... Now there's nothing left to sort out. Was my life really so empty? I should run away. Even if I have to live in fear, I want to feel it in my own skin. To talk with loved ones. To cry. To fight. Isn't that true happiness? A craving starts with a small thought like this, then gradually it takes over. 1 DAY, 9 HOURS, 9 MINUTES, 52 SECONDS LEFT 1 DAY, 9 HOURS, 9 MINUTES, 51 SECONDS LEFT 1 DAY, 9 HOURS, 9 MINUTES, 50 SECONDS LEFT 1 DAY, 9 HOURS, 9 MINUTES, 49 SECONDS LEFT 0 DAYS, 23 HOURS, 12 MINUTES, 30 SECONDS LEFT Wow! Only my favorite side dishes today! Mom, I want to run away. Are you crazy? Are you crazy?! You should be happy you're going to heaven! How can you think such a thing? I want to live! I want to live! I hate the idea of going to heaven without any pain or happiness and just disappearing! I hate it! So... You think you can avoid the reapers forever? What if you're caught? You know what happens if you're caught? Shut up, shut up! Mom, why can't I even say that I want to run away with you? Why? Because if you tell me to run away and I really do run away then you'll go to Hell too? That's why, isn't it?! I'm leaving. I'm probably never coming back. 0 DAYS, 7 HOURS, 6 MINUTES, 32 SECONDS LEFT 0 DAYS, 7 HOURS, 6 MINUTES, 31 SECONDS LEFT 0 DAYS, 7 HOURS, 6 MINUTES, 30 SECONDS LEFT 0 DAYS, 7 HOURS, 6 MINUTES, 29 SECONDS LEFT 0 DAYS, 7 HOURS, 6 MINUTES, 28 SECONDS LEFT 0 DAYS, 7 HOURS, 6 MINUTES, 27 SECONDS LEFT JAE-YEONG: Should I run away? Should I run away? I think about it dozens of times a day. Should I run away? Should I run away? There are only a few hours left. I don't have the courage to do it. Going to Heaven is a happy thing. No, it's not. I'm not someone who deserves to go to heaven. Mom... I miss my mom. I said something that broke Mom's heart. I need to apologize to my mom. Before we part forever. NEIGHBOR 1: What's all the fuss about? NEIGHBOR 2: Things like this make the property value go down. So won't our building's value go down too? NEIGHBOR 1: Yeah. This lady's not the type to do something like this all of a sudden. NEIGHBOR 3: What happened? I heard arguing last time I was here. NEIGHBOR 1: Oh. Last time? NEIGHBOR 3: Tsk, tsk, tsk. NEIGHBOR 4: Hey, did someone call the police? NEIGHBOR 4: What? Someone died here? Oh... Are you the daughter? I'm really not sure what to say. She committed suicide earlier today. I really don't understand it. Because we all know that you go to Hell if you kill yourself. After committing suicide, she was taken by the reapers. Oh! She left her last will and testament for her daughter. Here. "Mommy loves you so much. Please believe me about that. I wanted to leave it up to you whether you run away or not. But if I'd told you to run away, you wouldn't have out of concern for me. You don't know how much I've wanted to tell you this. What I'm saying is... What I'm saying is..."

Take it back, I said! CHANG-GYUN: I can't! I can't! No, I wasn't thinking about running away! I didn't go anywhere! I need to bring Chang-gyun with me. I haven't run away yet... So that means...

And the agony of Hell is ten times as bad as the worst pain you have ever felt.
