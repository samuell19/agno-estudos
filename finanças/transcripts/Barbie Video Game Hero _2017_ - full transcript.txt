You guys ready? I finally finished the level I was working on. Can't wait to see what you think. Can't wait. Super-stoked. Game on. Welcome to Cupcake Caverns. Are we llamas? Yup. Okay, the caverns are tricky. We're going to left, right, left, straight, left, right. Then you'll see the sugar flies. Jump and duck the flies. Spacebar to jump, and left click to duck. Look for any power-ups. We're gonna go up and over Sprinkle Falls. Remember, avoid the bears and their cupcakes. Got it? Roger that. Who's Roger? Heh. Sorry. Never mind. Everyone ready? Ready. Ready. The in-game tutorial is who I am. If you have any questions, then I am your man. Thanks, cloud man, we got this. Well, Barbie does. And go. Hey, guys, wait for me. Okay, so to get to the other side, we're gonna jump onto the mixer. Oh! Good job, Barbie. Way to go. This level is delicious. Ah, I wish we could just eat our way through the levels. Oh, sugar flies. Smash those cake pops. Piece of cake. Get it? Piece of cake? That was terrible, Renee. Okay, now to Sprinkle Falls. I'm going to code us a little power-up to help us over. It's so cool that you know how to code, Barbie, but isn't that cheating? Not if you're the one who created the game. Just one second. Flying power-up, engaged. I want wings. Renee, come on. Grab the power-up. Sorry, total newbe. I forgot how to jump? Space bar. Cool, we can fly. Over Sprinkle Falls, and we're done. Oh, cupcakes. Huh? What happened? Is it supposed to do that? No, something's wrong. Let me try this again. This should do it. Huh. I don't get it. That should've worked. I never thought I'd see a stumped Barbie. What's up? I don't know, Renee. I am definitely stumped. Could be a virus. Hmm. Not sure. This could take a minute. Sorry, Barbie. I gotta jet. I wish I could help, but I gotta go too. Good luck. See you, guys. Huh. Why won't this work? Maybe I'll try a reboot. Hey, Chelsea. What you doing? I'm trying to figure something out with my game. And what are you doing? Oh, sorry. Can I see your tablet, please? Yes. Or you can help me debug "Cupcake Cavern." Yes. Welcome to Cupcake Caverns. So, I'm the llama guy? You're the llama guy. Where'd I go? The wrong way. You're supposed to go into the cavern. Welcome to Cupcake Caverns. Why does that keep happening? Because you're going the wrong way. Oh, okay. Welcome to Cupcake Caverns. Chelsea, you have to go into the cavern. It's called "Cupcake Caverns." But I don't wanna go that way. It looks scary. It's how you play the game. But I don't wanna play the game that way. I wanna play the game my way. You can't. Why not? Because that's the way it's designed. Why does there only have to be one way? Because that's how it's programmed. Well, that doesn't sound like fun. You know what's fun? Your favourite game. Just Dance. You wanna play? I do love that game... ...but I wanna look into why this level is being glitchy. Maybe later? Okay. Smell that? I think Mom just made some cupcakes. Bring one back for me? But leave the tablet. Let's see if I can find a clue, see what's going on. All right, what's up with this tablet? What did Chelsea do this time? Huh? The in-game tutorial? Hello, Barbie. As a gamer who is better than all the rest... ...there is a new game we'd like you to beta test Tap yes or no, if you'll join this quest. Hmm. Yes. What a weird game. Ready, player one? Ready. Whoa! Huh? Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! What's happening? Whoa. Where am I? Huh? What am I? Do not worry, you will be all right. Thank you, Barbie, for accepting my invite. It's you. You asked me to beta test the game. Which means, I'm in the game. I'm in the game? How am I in the game? Well, you traveled across the Codeverse and beyond the sun. The place that you are is known as Level One. Okay, I like first-person games, but this is ridiculous. Uh...Uh, Barbie, I am sorry, but we cannot delay. Whoa! It is important that you get to play. Listen, two minutes ago, I was sitting in my bedroom... ...and now I'm in a video game. So you're going to have to give me a second. Okay, tell me who you are. Oh. Uh, heh. I'm sorry, I wish to be no stranger. I am the in-game tutorial known as Cutie. And our world is in danger. In danger from what? The Emoji Virus is what it is called. And our entire world, it will overhaul. Oh, emoji. They're so... ...not cute. Barbie, you are the most famous in the gaming land. Without your help, our world will not stand. Wow. I play a lot of video games. Barbie, um, well, I'm sorry to make this disclosure... ...but without your help, this world will be... Game over. You know, antivirus software could clear that up really quick. I could just pop out and run it. It wouldn't take me a minute. Well, it's not that easy, to my dismay. To beat this virus, you must win each level you play. So all I have to do is win the game, and that will destroy the virus? Cutie, you should've started with that. Let's play. Barbie enters the game. Hey, watch it. Bella enters the game. Oh, look, a newbie. Hey, Kris, check out the competition. Hey. Kris enters the game. Really, Bella? Heh. She doesn't look like competition to me. Hmm. Oh, really? I can skate. Ooh, she talks. Ha. That means you can say, "Congrats on your win, Bella." I think you mean, "Congrats on your win, Kris." So you're NPCs? You're an NPC. Yeah. Okay, what's an NPC? Non-Player Character. You're not controlled by a real-life player. Trust me, no one controls Bella. You'd better believe it. We're pretty good. Yeah, Oh, for sure. Uh...Uh, one more thing, Barbie. Before you begin, it is important that every level you do win. No problem. These two will be so busy trying to beat each other that I can just sail on by. Let's do this. Are you ready for what the Kris is cooking? That doesn't even make any sense. Racers, ready? Racers to the start line. Get set. Three, two, one... ...go. ♪ If you wanna fly ♪ Huh? ♪ Spread your wings and reach the sky ♪ See you. Wouldn't wanna be you. I don't think so. Unh!

Better luck next time. There's not going to be a next time if you don't let me win. Nice try, but you'll need a better trick than that to beat me. What's that? Oh, I can't stop. Neither can I. A power-up. Hang on. Serious air power-up, engaged. That was close. Huh? What were you saying about "close"? Oh, no. Well, that's a slam dunk. Why did you do that? Do what? Save you? Well, "save" is a pretty strong word. You're supposed to be competing against us, Barbie. Yeah, the goal of the game is to win. Right now the goal of the game is to defeat the virus. Because if the virus takes over, there is no game. The reason is clear why Barbie is here. She must win first place for all our sakes. So how do we stop it? I need to beat every level of the game. But I could use some help. Help? Our help? Heh. That's not how we play. We play to win. Me too. So let's win for all of us. Like a TM? Team. Yeah, I don't know about that. Listen, If you stay, you're going to become corrupted by the virus. You have to come with me. But we've never left this level. There's a first time for everything. Tornado power-up, engaged. And that time is now. Whoa. Quick, jump. Hurry. Quick, this way. Oh, no. Aah! What? Wow, Barbie really jumped the shark. We have one last jump up and over the finish line. I guess I'll let you win. You mean, I'll let her win. Oh, you two don't need to let me. Watch out! Aah! No! Bella! Huh? Whoa! Bella, I have an idea. Give me your hand. Barbie wins. Bella, awesome. Kris, nice try. Yes. All right. Uh... The virus is getting awfully near, but no need to worry. That portal is our way out of here. Let's go. Whoa. Where are we? I think this takes us to the next level. The level you did indeed defeat... ...but between levels is where you get your end treat. My what? Huh? Oh, my trophy. Hey, I win my level all the time. No one gives me a trophy. Uh, we're supposed to win our level. You mean, I'm supposed to. Oh, no, no. I'm supposed to. No, I'm supposed to. It looks like code. Wow, great trophy. What's code? Code is a set of instructions... ...that build or change functions in computer programming. If I put pieces together right, I can make changes to things around us. Here, let me show you. Wow, great trophy. I wanna try. See, each piece of code is unique. So if it doesn't work the first time... ...try again with a different piece. Whoa. Cutie, does every level have one of these? Oh, that's a good one. Uh...The...The answer to your question is yes. After each level, new code you'll possess. Now through the portal below to the next level is where we must go. You mean that tiny little door a million miles away? Uh-huh. Oh, well, in that case... And, oh, I love this bit. Without any further ado, welcome, players, to Level Two. Uh, Kris? You feeling a little flat? Very funny. Where did the acorns come from? Don't ask me. Ask them. Okay, we need to figure out what the game is. Can't we look around first? We never left our level before. But we're a... Thanks so much. You're the best. ...team. Woo-hoo! Yeah. Okay, Barbie, I guess we're flying solo for this one. Ten points. This is amazing. Who knew we could leave our level? I could get used to this. Taking it easy, making leaf angels. I'll bet I can beat you at taking it easy. No way. I'm the king of taking it easy. Taking it easy is my middle name. No, it's not. Ah. There you are. I've been searching about. Barbie might need you to go help her out. What? But it's our first day off in like forever. Yeah. And I'm beating Bella at taking it easy. No, you're not. Yes, I am. If this game is too hard, then here you should stay. If you think you can help, then, please, come and play. You know, for a cloud, he's not very uplifting. Yeah, he's kind of raining on our parade. He's always got his head in the clouds. Looks like it just got cloudy with a chance of showers. And no silver lining. I guess we kind of owe Barbie. She sort of saved us. I guess you're right. I'm always right. No, you're not. Okay, so the name of the game is to destroy the tree house. Please. Come up with a harder game. So now you're here to help? I can bring down the tree house faster. It's not a comp... Huh? Oh, you're on. What you doing? We have to knock the tree house down to finish the level. We're almost done. Hmm. What's she got to say about that? Huh? Who? Her. Oh, no. Help. Please. Not that Cutie is so wise... Well, actually, he is. ...but maybe look at the squirrel's eyes? Um, Bella, Kris. These squirrels have been corrupted by the virus. Not me. I didn't do it. Help! Please. We have to get her out of there. Bella, Kris, cover me. Uh, I just want everyone to know that it was Barbie's idea... ...to throw acorns at the tree house. Is it too late to ask what "cover me" means? Phew. Got you covered. No problemo. Huh. Hi, it looks like you've got a squirrel problem. I hope you have a squirrel solution! Huh. You don't, by any chance, have extremely long hair I can climb, do you? No, but I do have something nutty. Oh? Yes. Watch out! Ah! Oh, no. Wow, the girl's got moves. Ehh. I could do that. Oh, no. Oh, this isn't the game at all. I think the squirrels' code has been scrambled... ...but they turned on me before I could check. It's a virus. Ugh. Of course. Is it affecting the whole game? It will if we don't stop it. I have to beat this level. But how can you beat this level when the game no longer exists? It used to be a crystal-matching game. You match three crystals on the tree... ...they explode into acorns, and bring my house safely to the ground. Then the squirrels come eat the acorns. But suddenly, the squirrels started throwing acorns at my tree house. I'm doomed. Oh, no, you're not. Climb down. You can do it. I can't. What's your name? Crystal. Crystal, I'm Barbie. I don't want you to be scared. But if the squirrels keep going, you're going to be forced to leave this tree. I'm sorry. I'm afraid of heights. It's okay, Crystal. We'll get you out of there. Whoa. Whoa. She's a superhero. Aah! Bella, Kris, hello? A little help? Hmm? Huh? You go, girl. You got this. Uh, hello, Cutie alert. Barbie's point, you totally missed. I believe what she needs is you to assist. Right. Right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Speed power-up. Coming right at you. Batter up. Hey, Barbie. Teamwork. Oh, yeah, teamwork. Oh, no. Speed power-up, engaged. Barbie? This isn't good. It's the thought that counts? If we survive this, we're going to have a long talk about helping. I do not mean to worry, but you must beat this level in a hurry. Huh? Barbie, remember those virus guys from before? They're back, and they brought their friends. Oh, this isn't good. You know what we have to do? Yup. Unh! ♪ No one should do own their own ♪ ♪ We all need someone on our side, side ♪ ♪ Just look how far that we will go ♪ ♪ Together we come alive, alive ♪ Glad you could join us. Does their power-up ever run out? I need to complete the game. But I can't play if we're fighting off these squirrels. Whoa. I thought squirrels were supposed to eat acorns, not throw them. That's it. Cover me. Huh? That means you fend off the acorns while I try out a plan. Oh, sure, of course. Oh yeah, totally knew that. Aah! ♪ You'll never be alone ♪ ♪ Not now and not there ♪ OH! ♪ Cause we play, we play ♪ ♪ We play ♪ ♪ together ♪ ♪ We only get better ♪ Time to sing for your supper. ♪ No, we'll never say never ♪ Whoo! ♪ I know that we can beat... ♪ Oh, no! ♪ ...the odds ♪ Time to meet your match. ♪ Combined, our powers' strong, strong ♪ Yeah. ♪ We're always thinking out the box ♪ ♪ Cause the bad guys are nothin' on us, on us ♪ ♪ Now we're team ♪ ♪ That's all we need ♪ ♪ Now we can reach infinity ♪ ♪ Yeah, I guarantee that you and me ♪ ♪ Can be whatever we wanna be ♪ Winner, Barbie. Oh, hi. Crystal, you have to come with us. The virus is still out there. I don't know if I can. She's never been out of her tower before. I'm afraid her tree house was built with no door. You know, you could climb out of the window. I can climb out the window? Ready to try something new? Ha, ha. Uh-huh. Wow. I was programmed to stay in my house, but this feels amazing. Yeah, we pretty much ditched our programming too. Now we're a team. So, ah,... part of teamwork isn't disappearing when someone on your team needs you. Now you tell us. We told you we've never done this before. But we won, and that's all that counts. Yes. Um, excuse me, I hate to interrupt this moment of victory... ...but we must get to the end of this level, and quickly. Whoa! Hold on. I've always wanted a chance to use this. Oh Yeah! Yeah! Buckle up. Whoa, Cutie, do you even have your license? Whoa! Whoa! It looks like we lost the squirrels. And found a bunch of new ones. Turbo jump power-up, engaged. Cutie, what do we do now? Do not begin to fear. Cutie will get us out of here. Whoa! Hey, Cutie. We can leave this level through that waterfall. Um, I thought you weren't supposed to go chasing waterfalls. Collect coins for speed. Yeah! Woo-hoo! She's not good with heights. It's okay. We've got you. It's even kind of pretty if you open your eyes. See? There's the portal down below. Yes, it's beautiful, thank you. Hmm. What's that? Oh, Barbie, do not fret. Our mission there is one to forget. But what if the virus goes there too? There must be other players in there. The players there can stay retired. This bonus level is not, uh, required. Oh, it's a bonus level. So it's not part of the main game. This path is a risk you needn't take. The rest of the world is what's at stake. Hmm. I have to at least warn them. I don't know, if Cutie says we don't have to... You don't have to do. I do. I'm the one that needs to beat all of the levels. You brought me here for a reason, right, Cutie? What? Catch you on the flip side. Barbie, wait. Don't you wanna find more code first? Welcome to the bonus level. Player, take your mark. Let's do this. Welcome. You don't need to welcome me every time, Gaia. I was talking to the player. Oh, right. Hi, that's Gaia. And that's my sister, Maia. Hi, I'm Barbie. We don't get many players over here. Why not? Not everyone can unlock it. So it appears you're not everyone. Huh? Three. Listen, I need to warn you, your world is in danger. Two. I think the only one in danger... One. ...is you. Go. Whoa. ♪ Go ♪ ♪ We all have one simple goal ♪ Whoa! ♪ We just wanna celebrate ♪ ♪ Having fun, letting go ♪ No one said it would be easy. ♪ And we wouldn't have it another way ♪ ♪ Lalalala ♪ ♪ whooaah ♪ ♪ Lalalala ♪ ♪ whooaah ♪ ♪ Lalalala ♪ ♪ No telling just how far we could go ♪ ♪ Lalalala ♪ ♪ whooaah ♪ No. ♪ Lalalala ♪ ♪ whooaah ♪ ♪ Lalalala ♪ ♪ Make it what you wanna ♪ ♪ But you gotta just know ♪ ♪ Nothing's ever stopping you ♪ ♪ Got the power to choose right now ♪ ♪ you will never ♪ Huh? ♪ gonna ♪ Hi there. ♪ loose ♪ ♪ If you get up and move right now ♪ ♪ Get up ♪ ♪ Get up ♪ Hey! ♪ Get up ♪ ♪ Get up ♪ Did you really think you would outrun me? ♪ Get up and move right now ♪ I actually kind of did. ♪ Get up.

Ha, ha. ♪ Got the power to choose ♪ Whoa. Whoa! Why couldn't it be a dancing game? Time to go for the glow. Speed power-up, engaged. Whoa! Awesome. A virus is coming to take over your world. It's already here. What are you talking about? A virus is coming to take over your world. Why should we believe you? You don't need to believe me. Believe that. Whatever that is, I don't want it. How do we make the virus go away? I need to beat this level. Which means you need to beat us. There's only one problem with that. You can't beat us. We can't slow down. We're programmed to win. Oh, no. My power-up is powering down. Winner, Maia. Oh, no. Oh, no. Whoa. Barbie. Oh, you're okay. But you're not okay. The virus went into the level. And I... I didn't win. I'm sure you did the best you could. But I was supposed to win. And now there's no way back. The portal is gone. Cutie said it was a bonus level, right? So it doesn't matter, in terms of saving the bigger game. It matters to everyone in that level. I didn't save them. It's my fault. Barbie, you can't beat yourself up. It's not your fault. Whoa. Wait. What happened to the rhyme? Well, you see, it's, um... Heh. Well, it...it...it's not your fault, because it's mine. Seriously, is no one else freaking out about this no-rhyming thing? All of the players were having so much fun. At least, it looked like fun. Hey. Hey. No one talks to the in-game tutorial. So I had this idea. Uh, what if I wrote some code to create some friends? Ah. Except it turns out that the in-game tutorials don't know a lot about code. Heh. Oh, no. I created the virus. You created the virus? Wait, Cutie created the virus? Didn't you just hear that whole story? No, I was too busy nabbing this for Barbie. Wow, thanks. I am totally the best at this team thing. Yeah, you might need a little more work. Just saying. I didn't mean to create the virus. I was just a lonely in-game tutorial who,... well, as it turns out is terrible at programming. Which brings me to you, Barbie. I've seen you play. And you're the best. Cutie, you might have overestimated my skills. Oh, Barbie, I didn't just bring you here because you could beat the game. I brought you here because you can change it. Speaking of change, where did my elbows and knees go? Oh, finally. A soft landing. Oof! Speak for yourself, blockhead. You might wanna look in a mirror. So, Cutie, you brought me here because I can change the game? Change it how? I don't know what to do. Actually, this final level is where you can build... ...as it is a thing in which you are most skilled. When the game throws you rocks, then it's time to think outside the box. Think outside the box? Or maybe... Hmm. Hiya! Ha! I could think with a box. What are you doing? I'm changing the game. See? When I pound these boxes, they break. But these boxes multiply. I can build what I need. Huh? Huh? And what I need now is a way back. But isn't back the wrong way? Sometimes the wrong way is the right way. And sometimes you have to go back before you can go forward. Ah! Some people need my help. Hold down this level, and I'll be right back. Back? But where is she going? Am I the only one who's lost? Barbie! Barbie! Player, take your mark. Last time, I didn't use my head. Two. But I'm going to change that. One. I promise. Go. But, Barbie, you can't beat us. We told you, we're programmed to win. Don't worry, I've got a plan. Meet me at the finish line. Forge your own path. Yes. Ready. Player two. Player two? Oh, no. No, no, no. Miss me? What are you doing here? Helping you win the game. Isn't that what a team does? Yes. Yes, it is. BT dubs, that shortcut you built? Brilliant. Why don't we save the chit-chat for later? Let's go. Come on. Let's win this. Winner, Barbie. Barbie! The virus! Yeah. You're back. I couldn't have done it without Bella. You guys are getting pretty good at this team thing. Actually, I was only after the trophies. Huh? Just kidding. Went to help Barbie. But trophies. Right? Check it out. Turns out, when you win a bonus round, you win bonus stars. But the real bonus was bringing back Maia and Gaia. Huh? Where'd they go? Heh. There they are. Wait till you see how fast they are. Ha, ha. I... ...don't have... ...to run. I can go... ...as slow... ...as I want. Yeah. I think you might be mixing up your fast and your slow. And they're already a really great team. Yeah, speaking of team, what do we do now? Hmm. Oh, no. Cutie, what's wrong? My actions are what have brought us all here. I'm certain the virus is getting quite near. What makes you say that? Earthquakes are normal in this level, right? Save yourselves. Aah! Oh, no. Run. Oh, no. Oh, no. We lost the others. I thought they were right behind us. Bella, take a look around and see if you can spot them. We can't stay out in the open. Maybe I can make us somewhere to hide. Hmm. Ooh. That looks fun. I'll help. Hey, Barbie... ...you know all that stuff about working together as a team? Yeah? We're not the only ones doing it. What? Okay, that's different. I hope those guys are safe. Look. Kris. Hey. Oh, no. Huh? I can't look. No, look. Maia, Gaia. Hey. Hey. Mm. Cupcake blaster power-up, engaged. Sweet. Over here, virus ball. All right. Whoo! Yay! Ha, ha. Come on. Ha! That'll keep them occupied for a while. Did you guys see that? Cupcake blaster to the rescue. Just the cupcake blaster? Hmm? Oh, uh, heh, thanks for the assist. Poundsies? Huh? Huh? No? Anytime, slowpoke. Huh? Heh. Uh-huh! This cave will protect us while I try to code something to stop the virus. Kris, that was way too dangerous. Yeah, well, "way too dangerous" is my middle name. What? No, it's not. Uh, over to us, you got in a hurry, but everyone was quite filled with worry. I figured the virus couldn't follow all of us if we ran in opposite directions. So you didn't just panic? Because it looked like you panicked. Okay, there was some panic. But I asked myself one question: What would B...? What would Bella do? What would Barbie do? Or Bella. Both work. Ha, ha. I think we know what Barbie would do. Interrupting. Exclamation mark. I hate to cut our celebration short, but the virus out there we still must thwart. I saw it up close. It's getting bigger all the time. I don't know if we can thwart it. Can't we just avoid it? Let it have this level. We'll go someplace else. Where would we go? It's everywhere. Even with a place all of its own, the virus will never leave you alone. That's the nature of a virus. To spread quickly and infect everything... ...and everyone. Oh, no. And that's why I have to win all the levels, to save the game, and to save you all. Let's do this together. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Barbie, what's the plan? Remember all these code stars we won in the bonus level? That's our level. We brought those. I think we can use these like an antivirus. The code stars should change the corrupted emojis back into themselves. That sounds great. Except that I haven't figured out how to deliver the antivirus yet. There's got to be something we can use in here. Hey, Kris, give me your cupcake blaster. You know this is empty, right? That power-up ran out. Think you can make this shoot stars instead of cupcakes? I sure can. That's brilliant, Bella. It's not empty anymore. Huh. Nice idea. Let's go. I can't hit it. Not while it's out in the open. I need a place where I can get a good view... ...and where the virus can't run away. Something like... Like that thing right there? That's perfect. But it's going to take every last piece of code we've got... ...and every last move you've got to make it work. Here's the plan. What? Ah. Everyone in? Aye. Yup. I'm in. Uh-huh. Yes. Uh-huh. Let's win this. Hey, virus breath. Over here. Ha, ha. Ha! That's all you've got?

We need to blast it from all sides at once. But we only have one blaster. I know. But we have a lot of doors. I'm going to blast it with everything I've got. Clear the area and keep yourself safe. We're not leaving you. We're a TM. I know we are. And I won't let you down. I'm only going to get one shot at this. Your plan is good, but you must delay. It seems that Crystal is still in the way. Aah! Oh, no. Crystal. You need to move away from the door. I can't. I can't move. Come on, you can do this. Crystal, we don't have much time. Please, hurry, Crystal.

Uh, did someone turn up the bass? Not again. Come on. Follow me. We have to stick together. We need to come up with a plan to beat this level. This time we're stuck, there is no doubt. Oh, I don't know what to do. There is no way out. Barbie, what do we do now? There's gotta be another way. I'm not having fun right now, guys. Just letting you know. My sister, Chelsea, asked me why there's only one way to do things. I didn't have an answer. But when I came here, you all helped me learn something. We did? Yes. We don't have to do what we're programmed to do. I can change the game. But you've been changing the game all along. You made the antivirus. And went back to the bonus round. And you beat us. And you beat us. And you fed my squirrels when they went nuts. You're right. Now it's time to change the game to fit me. But I'm going to need a little more code. Uh, Barbie? What? I kind of have some code left. I didn't think it would make any difference against the virus... ...and I wanted a trophy of my own. I'm sorry. Bella. Huh? You're brilliant. We're done running. It's time to change this game and have some fun. ♪ And right now it's your chance ♪ ♪ High how you wanna Play♪ ♪ How high you wanna play ♪ Welcome to the Final Level. Barbie, what are you doing? Don't worry. I got this. What kind of game is this? The in-game tutorial is who you need. I'll tell you the rules before you proceed. In this corner stands the Emoji Virus. He's big, and he's purple, and he wants to destroy us. Boo! But over in this corner, look and you'll see... ...she's courageous and fearless, it's our friend Barbie. And follow the pictograms is what you must do. It's a "Just Dance" dance battle, which is well-known to you. Keep an eye on the score bar to see who's ahead. The leader has the crown, and now it's all said. This thing can't dance. The big boss has entered the level. Oh, no, it can dance. A backup dancer boosts your score. Only thing better is having some more. Huh? I can't bend my elbows or knees. Cutie, I need your help. Barbie, I hate to digress, but last time I coded, I made quite a mess. I know you can do it, Cutie. Hurry, Cutie. Cutie knows just what to do. Once again, to the rescue. Yes, I got my elbows back. Huh? He's blocking the pictogram. Let's help Barbie. I'm on it. Coming in hot. It's working. But it's not enough. What we need is a boost. Surely you jest. From little to big works the best. Yeah! Yeah! We're catching up. You guys, I can't get ahead. Barbie, we might not make it. Then I'm gonna do it my way. Huh? Ha, ha! Winner, Woo-hoo! Barbie. Uh-oh. Yeah! All right! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Oh, jubilation. Oh, the virus is gone, and we are saved, you see. Thanks to the imagination of a girl named Barbie. You did it! Ha, ha! We did it. Oh. Gaia, can I keep them? We'll talk about it later. I can't wait to show you all the cool stuff in our level. Ours too. Ours too. Oh, and mine. That sounds great, everyone, but... You have to go back. I do kind of have a life on the other side of the screen. But I'll miss you. Ah. Me too. You'll come back, right? I'm just a few taps of the screen away. There's a screen? Uh, I'll explain it when we're back home. Thanks for helping me be less scared, Barbie. It's okay to be scared. You just can't let it stop you. So if I'm scared of you leaving, does that mean you'll stay? Aw. You know, you're the first real friend I've ever had. Hello? I'm right here. Oh, you know what I mean. We spend so much of our time trying to win our level that sometimes... We miss out on who we're playing with. Well, now you can try a whole new way to play. So, Cutie, I guess this is goodbye. I'm not very good with goodbyes. Thank you, Barbie, for all that you do. I'm sorry for creating the virus... ...but not sad I met you. Aw. Aw. Okay, now it's time to go. Wait. There is one last thing. There is? Kris is right. Oh. Barbie needs to get her trophy. Oh? Wow. Huh? I think this is my ride. Bye, Barbie. Later. I'll miss you. Bye-bye. See you. Don't think of it as goodbye. Think of it as "good game." Ha, ha. Come on. Ha, ha. Good game. Whoa. Teresa, Renee, you there? Hey, Barbie, what's up? Did you miss us or something? It's only been 10 minutes. I did. Heh. Sometimes 10 minutes can feel like forever. I figured out what wasn't working. Did you find the answer in that code book of yours? Let's just say, sometimes you need a little change in perspective. Here it goes. You guys ready to help me beat this level now? Sure thing. Game on. Welcome to Cupcake Caverns. I love that we're llamas. Remember, we need to get over the mixer and past the sugar flies. So far, so good. Over Sprinkle Falls, and we're done. Well, we've heard that before. Avoid the bears and let's go for the win. Yes. Barbie, you did it. Yeah, your code totally worked. Whoo! Well, I couldn't have done it without some help from my friends. Huh? Hey, Chelsea. Guys, there's someone I need to talk to. I'm gonna sign off. Great job, Barbie. Time to celebrate. TTYL. TTYL. See you, guys. Where were you? What's that? A trophy. A trophy? For what? It's for someone who inspired me to think outside the box. Who's that? You. Me? Really? Yes, really. Awesome. Do you know what's even more awesome? No. What? Just Dance. Wanna have some fun? Yes.
