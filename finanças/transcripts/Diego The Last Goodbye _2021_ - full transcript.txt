"THERE IS NO EASY WAY FROM THE EARTH TO THE STARS." SENECA When you're high, high, high, high, there's no pressurization up there, and not many of us get there. That's why they can talk a lot about me, but nobody was up there with me. There's loneliness, there's cold, but there's also a heart that beats much faster for having done things well. SAN ANDRÉS GATED COMMUNITY TIGRE, NORTH OF BUENOS AIRES The night before I asked him "Are you okay? Do you need anything?" He answered "Chamita, let me rest." He gave me a kiss and I left, without thinking what was going to happen the next day. I saw him for the last time when I brought him some sandwiches. He was lying down and that's the last time I saw him. If I had known that was his last night, I wouldn't have let him sleep. NOVEMBER 25, 2020 JULIO CORIA "CHAMA" MARADONA'S BODYGUARD At 6:30 the nurses were changing shifts, so I used that opportunity to take a shower. We got to his bedroom's door. We called him, he didn't answer. He was half covered, face up. It looked as if he was sleeping. When I go down, the only thing I hear is "He's non responsive." The nurse came in to do CPR. Was it five minutes, ten minutes, half an hour? I have no idea. For me it was an eternity. It was hell. I thought he was going to wake up. ROMINA RODRÍGUEZ "MONONA" COOK Even now I think I hear his voice: "Monona!" I was getting ready to go to work and I received a call from the community's security, and they ask me if I can go see Diego Maradona. They told me that he had become unbalanced, that they had already called an ambulance and if I could go see him. I go in through the right side of the house, through a gate, and when I entered the kitchen I saw the maid. They were very nervous, very desperate for me to come in and see what I could do. When I entered the room, I saw Diego on the left side of the bed, he seemed to be sleeping, and his bodyguard was giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and the nurse was on the bed doing chest compressions. I tried to look for vital signs and I noticed that his body temperature was well below normal. There are five ambulances. Something happened to him. Six! Eighth ambulance. Something happened to Diego. When the first ambulance arrived, it was at that moment that we really, for the first time, had the elements to be able to do something for Diego. The nurse came down with a briefcase with medication, we moved the bed to be able to have an access to the airway, he put the defibrillator to see if there was any type of electrical activity in the heart. A female doctor caught my attention that all she did was go in and out of the room shouting "Come on, Diego, come on, Diego!" At that moment we looked at each other and all it took was a look and a gesture to realize that Diego was no longer alive. SEPTEMBER 8, 2019 14 MONTHS BEFORE HIS DEATH GIMNASIA Y ESGRIMA LA PLATA STADIUM THE HEART DOESN'T UNDERSTAND REASON AFTER 8 YEARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY DIEGO MARADONA RETURNS AND TAKES OVER AS COACH OF GIMNASIA Y ESGRIMA LA PLATA, A TEAM ABOUT TO BE RELEGATED. I think that going back to work and being on a field was the best thing that could happen to him. Diego's appearance as coach caused a revolution in Argentina's football and the world. He was very excited because... DANIEL LÓPEZ MARADONA DIEGO'S NEPHEW At least when we were in Mexico, he said to me "Do people in Argentina still love me?" I think he was the only one who could lift the situation Gimnasia was in. A very difficult situation, fighting the relegation, and the team as a group was bad, mentally down. I'm not a magician. I like to work, as I've done all my life. So nervous! I'm Eva Pardo. I'm the official photographer of the Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata team. He was very excited and very touched, as we all were. He was coming from his knee recovery and it was difficult for him to walk. We thought that the presentation was going to last five or ten minutes, which was what we had scheduled, but an hour passed, an hour and 15 minutes and he was still there. From very early on we were in the locker room waiting for Diego, until he came to me and hugged me and told me: "Don't worry, we're going to move forward together. I need to be inside a field." Returning to Argentina and returning to train in the First Division, with "the smell of grass", as he used to say. STEFANO CECI FRIEND AND MANAGER That made him happy, plus, he found a good atmosphere. I saw Gimnasia as a little Napoli. NAPLES, ITALY We've gone to great lengths to have you! Oh, mama, mama, mama! Maradona is better than Pelé! My heart is beating, I've seen Maradona There's only one Maradona And, mom, I am in love! When the Napoli bus arrived, everyone looked to see if Diego was there, because if Diego was there, Napoli would win. So when we saw him get off the bus... "We won!" Go, Diego! In Diego's presentation in "El Bosque", there was a flag that had his parents, La Tota and Don Diego, and it said: "Pelu, when you're down, go where you are loved." I learned from my parents that you should never forget what you went through. Everything gives you experience to face life. So we can't forget what we went through, all my dad's effort, he got up at 3 a.m. to go to work, he came home without sleeping and took me to training. Material things can help, but what Mom and Dad taught us at that time was all with love. That's why we are like this, that's why Mom is proud of the children she has. VILLA FIORITO LANÚS, SOUTH OF BUENOS AIRES I'm the oldest. Kitty, Lily, Mary, Diego. ANA MARADONA DIEGO'S SISTER Lalo, Hugo and Claudia. In Fiorito they were a very united family, everyone pulled together to the same side, trying to get out of that situation. My grandfather worked in the factory, Tritumol. The only one who supported the family was him. Sometimes we brought him food and we had to walk a lot because from home it was over half a mile to Tritumol. TRITUMOL BONE GRINDER VILLA FIORITO There were times when they would give him milk in the factory, but he wouldn't drink it, he gave it to us. He used to say "No, I'm not going to drink it", I'll take it to the kids." One day I don't remember what mess I had gotten into, and my old man was waiting for me at the door. "Come in," he tells me, and he had a branch in his hand. I tell him "You're going to hit me, dad." "No, no, no, come in. You come in." So I always say that's where I started to score the goal against the English, because of the feints that I made to my old man, because I tired my old man. When I saw the opportunity, "bang", I got in. He landed one hit sometimes, but it was one. Sure, he gave me a smack and he threw me 80 feet. I'll never forget in my life, my mother said to him: "You touch my son again" and tonight, when you fall asleep, "I'll put a knife through your heart." Good, skinny! Good, skinny! Move it, move it! Move! He had a vision with players that were not taken into account and he empowered them. - You look fit. -Yes? I'm old! I'm Eric Ramírez and I'm a football player. My nickname is "Pearl". I wasn't playing very much. I was neither training nor in the bench, nothing. ESTANCIA CHICA - GIMNASIA Y ESGRIMA LA PLATA TRAINING When Diego arrives, before traveling to Mar del Plata, he tells me: "Look, Perla, you're going to play", so make use of it and I'll always support you." A boy from a humble family, who fought out there, just like Diego, who also fought since he was a child. Being something similar, I think it comforts him. He always wanted to win. We always started winning, they tied us and sometimes we lost the game. So that pissed him off a bit, not keeping up the result. Nobody bet a dime on Gimnasia, everybody thought we would be relegated. The only one who bet for us was Diego. Gimnasia needed to win, we needed to add three points. Gimnasia believes in miracles. Ramirez hit it, it diverted on top. Maradona's Gimnasia. Gimnasia in the lead in Avellaneda. Diego got crazy, he got inside the field screaming the goal. When I left he congratulated me, he gave me a hug that I'll never forget. It was totally crazy, obviously with Diego at the head of all those celebrations. Traveling through the interior of the country where he played was beautiful because people went crazy with Diego's presence. It was seeing people in airports, people who followed the bus, in the hotel, everywhere. Seeing people cry, people with kids, people with signs, people waiting for him. LONG LIVE THE KING On the Newell's field, I think it's one of the times where I was most moved, because people were crying, crying, people hugging, people were very moved. All those tributes, without a doubt, was what he deserved. It was the tribute that Argentine football wanted to pay to the best player in our history. AVELLANEDA - TRIBUTE FROM INDEPENDIENTE CLUB CÓRDOBA TRIBUTE FROM TALLERES CLUB BUENOS AIRES - TRIBUTE FROM BOCA JUNIORS CLUB MARCH 20, 20206 MONTHS BEFORE HIS DEATH We have made the decision in the National Government to issue a decree of necessity and urgency. ALBERTO FERNÁNDEZ PRESIDENT OF ARGENTINA By this decree, all of Argentina must comply with the preventive and compulsory social isolation. No one can leave their residence. Everyone has to stay at home. Hi there. Romina Rodríguez, "Monona", unemployed. I started going to Diego's. I went to cook, I served him. I had no intention of meeting him. I had a bad image of him. I didn't want to go near him. And he said "I want that chubby girl to come with me." That's how it started. CAMPOS DE ROCA GATED COMMUNITY BRANDSEN During the lockdown they told me to stay as a live-in maid. He named me "Monona", he named Julio, the security boy, "Chama", for chamamé. One day he was calling everyone and no one heard him and he yelled "Chamamé!" Everything could be fine and then he would get angry and tell you "Go away, shut up", and didn't want to talk to anyone. And no one spoke. And one day I was doing the laundry outside and he called me and I didn't hear him. So he said: "Grab your things, Monona, and walk away." He thought that I wasn't going to leave, like everyone else. I knocked on the door and said: "Well", it's been a pleasure working with you. I'm leaving now." And he says to me "Where are you going?", I answered "Didn't you tell me to go?", "Yes, yes, but you are going to leave at the time I want." The next day I came down with my bag and my things, and he looks at me and says: "Hello, Monona, my dear!" I remained serious and said "But you fired me." "Yes, but that was yesterday, today is another day. You're not fired anymore, today you're here." "The next time you fire me, I'll go and you'll never see me again." "No, Monona, I won't fire you anymore," he told me. And he never did. But he was always firing everyone. When I found out about the lockdown, I got really worried about Diego, because I thought "Now Diego isn't going to come out anymore" and on top of that no one could go to see him, no one could go in to be with him. We made video calls, he called me on the phone. He needed to see us, he wanted to make a barbecue and we didn't want to because we wanted to take care of him. We didn't want it to be our fault that we brought the COVID to his house. I think it was a hard blow for him too, because he needed to train, he needed the motivation. Being alone used to kill him. I spent more time with Diego than with my real brothers. My daughters were born and I wasn't there. My father passed away and I wasn't there. Where was I? I was with Diego. His fear was being alone. His alcohol issue was according to how he was at that moment. When he was angry or lovesick it was one thing, and when he was happy it was another. When he was in a bad mood, he started to drink, but he also had the gastric bypass problem. Diego had a beer and it was three beers, so when he had four or five, it was 10, 15, so, in 20 minutes he was already... He never stopped drinking. And he really suffered his children's detachment. He wanted to have everyone together. At one point he told me: "Matito, I can't stand it anymore." In fact, he was so bad that I took him to a therapist. Hi, how are you? Carlos Díaz, I'm a therapist specialized in treating substance use and addictions. The first time was four days before his 60th birthday. And they suggested me that I used the words "psychiatrist" or "therapist" as little as possible because of the previous experiences that Maradona had. Deception is a terrible starting point. A therapist can never agree to not saying what he's doing. OCTOBER 30, 202026 DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH It had been a difficult week, nobody knew if Diego was going to be able to be present, the match was on the day of his birthday, the day the championship started again. When I saw him appear, it really surprised me, it was kind of a shock, right? Happy birthday, Diego! The tripero town greets you. He was very deteriorated. Whenever we saw him like that, it hurt us. So when he got closer, so I could take his picture, I said to him: "Happy birthday, Diego." Happy birthday, Diego! Hi there. Happy Birthday! He didn't answer me or anything. It seemed like he wasn't there. And that was the last time I saw him. We were about to enter the field and he asked us to forgive him. "Sorry, I'm going to recover to come back stronger for you." The saddest moment in Diego's life. RICARDO GIUSTI WORLD CHAMPION MEXICO 1986 It's incredible that they exposed him that way. Seeing someone you love so deeply in a situation you don't want to see them in... I think that was a sad day for everyone. Diego's appearance was not only painful, but it also forces us to ask ourselves "All those people who said they loved him, did they love him?" NOVEMBER 3, 202022 DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH DIEGO MARADONA UNDERGOES SURGERY FOR A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA ON THE HEAD. DURING THE POST-OP PERIOD HE SUFFERS ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL ATTACKS. I am Enrique da Rosa Alabaster. I'm a psychiatrist, neurologist and forensic doctor. What are the causes of a subdural hematoma? The most common, obviously, is a head injury that doesn't need to be very big, that's the danger. But we mustn't forget the consumption of substances, among them, particularly, alcohol. Diego, darling, Gimnasia is with you We saw that in the postop he experienced some confusion. We, along with therapy doctors, associate it with a withdrawal condition. The idea is to do a treatment for this withdrawal. We think this will last a few days. I accompanied Diego to the hospital in Dubai. During the night he ripped out his IV drip and he started saying "Let's get out, let's go", there was blood on the floor, "Let's go, that's it, let's go." CANTEGRIL HOSPITAL PUNTA DEL ESTE, URUGUAY, 2000 LA PRADERA MEDICAL CENTER HAVANA, CUBA, 2000 ARGENTINA-SWISS CLINIC BUENOS AIRES, 2004 Admitting a patient like Diego is not an easy task. They didn't accept us anywhere. We were rejected in an incredible way and there came a time when we didn't know what to do. I get the impression that this is the last chance we have. MARADONA HOSPITALIZED AGAIN GUEMES HOSPITAL BUENOS AIRES, 2007 When he was admitted in November it hit me hard. I remember writing to a friend: "Are you watching TV, are you watching Diego?" She answered "Yes, but it's Maradona", he always gets out." In the year 2007 I had a very big depression and my mother decided to admit me to a clinic. When I came in, I saw him sitting on the patio. It seemed fantastic. "I'm in a neuropsychiatric" with Maradona. They won't believe me." I had been around long enough and I began to have crying fits, crisis. They held me down between three nurses and in a quite violent situation they injected me. I couldn't move, I couldn't gesticulate, everything went black because I don't remember anything else. I don't know if one, two or three days later, I had another uncontrollable crying attack and the same three nurses came. Diego stood up, stood in front of me, held me with both arms, he looked at them and said: "It's not going to happen," not with the girl! "Bring me the phone, I'm going to call her mother." And they told him "No, the phone call hours has ended." And in a moment he got fed up and told them: "In five minutes I'll set everything on fire. Bring me the phone." "Hello, madam," "Who's talking?", "Diego", "What Diego?", "Diego Armando Maradona. Don't worry, the girl is fine," but I think you have to come pick her up "and she has to spend the night at home, with you." Maradona saved my life. NOVEMBER 11, 202014 DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH Diego has a very good prognosis, a very favorable evolution regarding the surgery and the withdrawal picture that we discussed previously, that's why we're considering a discharge. We are preparing the place that will receive him, which will be a house designed for his recovery. The good thing is that Diego is whole, Diego is firm, there is Maradona for a while and what's needed now is family union and being surrounded by health professionals. Home hospitalization is always complicated, much more in the field of addictions. The relatively serious patient will be a patient who isn't in a position to be controlled by relatives or therapeutic assistants. The treatments don't involve locking up a person or tying their hands. Recovery for an addict takes place in the community. That's what the scientific evidence shows as well. A patient with a heart disease but also an addiction, a subdural hematoma means transferring a neurosurgery department, an intensive care unit, a cardiology department and a psychiatric ward to a private setting. We were great in La Plata, and from there we went directly to Tigre. I got there and everything was prepared, let's say. I have lived in the San Andrés gated community for years and we are a very small neighborhood where we all know each other by name. I didn't think we were going to lose peace, I saw it as something special. We were going to be a part of his life. We never saw him walking around the neighborhood. My husband and my son saw him once, there was a little hole and you could see him, he was sitting there on a chair. Then, when you walked by, there was the World Cup that was on the grill. It was one of the issues on the famous Olivos Clinic meeting. His daughters and family members said they were going to see to it that there was no alcohol, and there was no alcohol. Anyway, let me tell you, there was no alcohol because Diego was already in a condition that I don't know if he even wanted to drink alcohol. Everyone knew that Diego had heart problems, he wasn't good. They sent an email to the neighborhood saying that there was going to be an ambulance 24/7. There was never an ambulance. It wasn't easy being his doctor and saying to him: "Look, Diego, take care of yourself in this, and take care of yourself in that", because he had that temper. He told you: "Doctor, are you going to tell me what to do? I know my body and I know how to handle myself." He didn't do what he had to do. Diego managed his body, Diego disposed of his body, and he knew PABLO LLONTO JOURNALIST and he listened to what his family told him, and then made the decision to continue with his body. It's the same as if I told you "don't smoke" or "don't drink" or "don't eat." We are old enough so as to tell you the things you have to do. He had a very, very, very screwed-up temper. It was a Sunday, he wanted to see me and it really was something wonderful because I found a committed Maradona, a willing Maradona, a receptive Maradona, a human Maradona. I'm not a doctor, but I'm not stupid either. Diego had 20 years of cocaine addiction, Diego had alcohol problems, Diego had heart problems, liver problems, kidney problems, knee problems, back problems, head problems. He had problems everywhere. That's why I'm telling you: only Diego Armando Maradona could reach 60. NOVEMBER 25, 2020 1:06 P.M. Football legend Diego Maradona has died. MARADONA IS DEAD "Diego passed away." "Don't screw with me," I tell him. It must be someone who made something up because they want news. "Diego died." Then I replied "What are you saying?" And he, between angry and in pain, shouted "Diego died!" And I cut him off. I was in London, taking a nap, and my wife came to wake me up with my youngest son and they told me that Diego had died. And then the phone calls begun, the WhatsApp messages, "Diego died", "Diego died", "Diego died." I immediately got in the car and came to Buenos Aires. And I didn't understand anything, I didn't understand anything of what was happening and I was really shocked. I was shocked, stunned, hearing the news that no one wanted to hear. I think the natural reaction that everyone of us who loved Diego had was to break into tears, to start crying without finding a... Thinking it's not true until it really is. I didn't want to get to my house. It was impossible to walk a block and get to my house, it was like... "No, no, no, no, no." My mom always used to ask me two questions. "How are you, good? Did you speak to Diego?" I think that every Neapolitan feels they have lost a relative. When I received the news, I froze up, "I talked to him the day before yesterday." What remains with me is my brother's smile. Nothing more. "Thermos head", "I vaccinated her", "The turtle's got away." I was until 3 in the morning debating with many journalists what was the right translation for "You have it inside." "You have it inside" means absolutely nothing. My name is Marcela Mora y Araujo. My job is to write. I feel that my task is to explain us Argentines to the world, and that soccer is the best tool to do that. Immediately I began to receive requests for live interviews from Sky News, the BBC, Channel 4, a Turkish radio. The BBC is many different programs, television, radio... I also had to deliver an obituary to the London Guardian, that I had been putting off for years because I never believed that he was going to die. And the hours passed and they kept asking me "And how do Argentines feel?", as if there was only one answer from Argentines, like we all feel the same. I met them when they were two kids madly in love with each other in Barcelona in 1983. They were discovering the world, a world that, I believe, they didn't even dare to dream of, because kids who are born in those conditions aren't allowed to have big dreams. I'm not absolutely certain, but I don't think I'm wrong, she was his biggest love. Seeing them together was a pleasure. I saw that couple and saw an eternal love that seemed indestructible. Claudia was always good for him, from start to finish, and I know it. I know that because I lived it. Besides, she was very young when her relationship with my uncle began, and she was and always will be my aunt. We were going to northern Italy, the two of us, talking about a thousand things and talking about relationships, and he at one point told me: "Professor, neither Claudia" nor anyone else is going to forbid me "to do with my life whatever I want to do." NOVEMBER 25, 2020 1:50 P.M. When Claudia arrived, the first thing that struck me is that she wanted people to get out to try to take care of privacy. If there had to be people from the police or from the prosecutor's office, fine, but not one person more nor one person less. Until the last moment you could tell that she was taking care of him. The police were there, the forensics teams were there, they were all there and they wouldn't let us in. Then we asked them to please let us in. My son was even there too, he said "He's my godfather, he's my uncle, I want to..." and, well, they let him in. It was terrible, but even to this day I still don't believe that... I thought he was asleep, and I still believe he's asleep, that one day I'm going to see him. When I arrived and they saw me crying, my daughters told me "Mom, why don't we make a flower arrangement for Diego?" To get to Diego's house, which is on the corner, you have two entrances. I went in through the first one and there I saw Claudia, Giannina, Dalma, the truck, Diego was there. Claudia looked at me and said "Come here", and that's when she cried, she hugged me, I hugged her, Dalma and Giannina too, I gave them a kiss, they said "Thank you", I threw the flowers and they landed on top of the truck. With great sorrow we can confirm with great grief the death of Diego Armando Maradona. No signs were noticed... Diego Armando Maradona's body leaves the building... ITALY 1990 WORLD CUP FINAL ARGENTINA 0 - GERMANY 1 It cost me a lot. PEDRO MONZÓN WORLD CUP RUNNER-UP ITALY 1990 Because of that baggage that I had to... Of having lost a World Cup, of having been expelled, that many people yelled at me in the street that it was my fault "You lost the final, little drug addict son of a..." And a lot of things mixed up. Addictions too. I thought that life was no longer worth living and once I had decided that this was going to be the last day of my life, I thought to make a deal with myself. "I'm going to call Diego." "If Diego doesn't come, I'll stop living." I had a loaded gun and I remembered his phone number. And suddenly I heard a tap on the window, and there I saw him, in shorts, flip flops, and there we started talking But I never told him what I was thinking, because we would get into a fist fight, and how could I raise my hand to Diego? From there, my life began to change. I started believing much more in God. I am Gabriela Pepe, I'm a journalist at Casa Rosada since December 2019. CASA ROSADA - HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT President Alberto Fernández announced that Diego's wake was going to be at Casa Rosada. He said that he had spoken with Claudia and that the Government had been made available. My first thought was that the farewell was going to have to last several days. I get to Casa Rosada, ask how the farewell will be, how long it will last, and there they tell me that Claudia had set some conditions and had asked for it to end at 4 in the afternoon. My first thought was "This is going to be a disaster." NOVEMBER 25, 2020 11:50 P.M. Diego's body arrived at La Paternal, where he had begun his football career, a few blocks away from the Argentinos Juniors stadium, as if it were a circle that was closing in Diego's life. DIEGO MARADONA'S SANCTUARY LA PATERNAL, BUENOS AIRES I was 17 years old and they assigned me to cover Argentinos Juniors. And I start going to the trainings at La Paternal and there I met Diego. This is the day of his debut, he is on the bench, before joining the match against Talleres de Córdoba. I remember from those years several fans who made songs related to Maradona's origins. They yelled at him "damn slum crap." Those things hurt him and he reacted to that and he insulted. I prefer that they call me "mean Maradona" rather than "the poverino", do you understand? I don't like that "poverino", because they say it derogatorily. I prefer them to call me "mean". I am mean, but "volantiere", as they say. - Volantiere? How is that? - Yes, yes, with pleasure. The house that the club bought him and that became the first house with certain comforts for the Maradona family was a very simple house. Diego himself over the years always used that house as an example like the great breakthrough for the family, being able to get out of that Fiorito that he never rejected, but that clearly marked the difference. In Lascano we were billionaires! But we were happy, we were happy with very little. Lascano's house was not just a building, it was a symbol, from which Diego consolidated as a "pater familia." Parents, brothers, nephews, brothers-in-law... From that moment they would all depend on Diego. And he thought of the family, he thought of my parents. And that is a pride for us. - I was sunbathing yesterday. - Really? Perfect! Luis Manrique. Retired, unemployed. Do you speak English? Yes, sir, I lived 44 years in the United States. I was deported. One day I called my sister in Mendoza and she told me that my mother had passed away. So I called my deporter and told him to deport me as soon as possible, that I was done fighting. Listening to the radio, I found out that a lot people were already gathering downtown. Diego, darling, The people are with you I have to be there. I have to give a farewell to Diego somehow. My name is Damián Juárez, I own a workshop. I wore River's shirt. I already had my mind set on giving that shirt to Maradona. So my dad and my brother, when they saw me leave wearing River's shirt, they told me: "This guy is crazy, they're going to kill him." That night, "The 12" was already in Plaza de Mayo. One group even climbed the Manuel Belgrano monument, as if it were a great paravalanche. He's worth 10 thousand dollars His name is Maradona And all the chickens Can suck his balls And when he goes to the field "The 12" thanks him For everything Dieguito deserves Rafael Di Zeo, Boca fan, fanatic. Profession, employee. I can't include "The 12" in that presentation. I can't say... I don't usually say "Chief of the Boca hooligan firm" because the police has a chief. We are friends. Is this one better? I sent him that shirt, from the 12, and he took the picture and sent it to me. Our friendship was kind of secret. Because of who he was and because of who I am. You know how it is, the media tells you "How can Maradona be friends with him" or can he be friends with Maradona?" Those are prejudices that people and society have. The boys were on the monument tying the flags and they stayed on top of the horse, the police wanted them to come down but they didn't pay attention. So they came to ask us if we could do it, and when we told them to get down, they did it immediately, and the police looked at us like saying "You tell them once and they get off, we were 10 minutes asking them and they didn't do it." I met a boy, Damián. As soon as he saw me, he said... He pointed at me like this, "We'll go in together." I said "okay, okay, we go in together." We were all drunk, I thought "He must be drunk." I, since he was an older man, I told him: "Rest assured that I'm going to accompany you." Because I thought "This man is going to break down." Some boys, apparently Boca supporters, were handing out flowers. So I asked him for a flower, but he wouldn't give it to me, because I had River's shirt. And Luis spoke to him and he came after a while, he apologized and gave me the flower. My instinct was to tell him: "Give him a flower, we are at a wake." NOVEMBER 26, 2020 1:30 A.M. We were with Ruggeri saying: "Can you believe that Diego is in there?" "Can you believe that Diego is in there?" And there was Diego. We couldn't understand it. His daughters wanted us, the employees, to participate. At no time did they say "no", on the contrary, they included us. "You, Monona, have to be there, the security guys have to be there." I didn't leave at any time, I was all night on the outside. I went in and out, but stayed more on the outside. I approached at one point, I wanted to put a T-shirt that says "The 12, the owners of history." I asked Claudia for permission, she said yes, no problem. So when I put the shirt on his feet, I touched his leg with my right hand, his just left leg, precisely, and at that moment a lot of things went through my head, because it was that leg the one that made him who he was. His face had the expression of someone who has suffered. But he was... He was calm. I mean, you left without suffering. NOVEMBER 26, 2020 6:00 A.M. When the family's wake ended, the coffin was taken to the Latin American Patriots Hall, where the public wake was going to take place. During the morning, the preliminary results of the autopsy were known. Diego had died of chronic acute heart failure that caused pulmonary edema. What I remember in the morning is that there were some Lanús fans who were making a mess and that because of them they disarmed our line. And the police came, before we got in, they came to where we were and wanted to hit the people. They threw the fences and well, then I lost Luis. I told one of the boys, there were two helping me, I told him: "Wait, I have to give this shirt to Maradona." He told me: "Wear it, because Diego has many shirts," and he told me that this shirt was worth a lot. And yes, for me this shirt is worth a lot, that's why it was the one I wanted to give him. But, hey, it couldn't be. When I got out, I saw Damián. "I was looking for you," he told me. And I said "I was looking for you too and we got lost." When I opened my eyes, I saw a lot of cameramen and photographers taking pictures. Diego immortalized me. I believe that these things could only be done by Maradona. Only Maradona could do them. NOVEMBER 26, 2020 10:00 A.M. Argentina had taken very severe measures regarding restrictions to the circulation and the gatherings from the month of April onwards. USE HAND SANITIZER There was nothing, nothing that showed that we were in a lockdown due to the coronavirus or anything like it. It was the first time that so many people met on the street, it was also like shaking a little what the pandemic had meant. I had the possibility of entering the Casa Rosada as a journalist, but I decided to queue to say goodbye to Diego like the rest of the people. I also wanted to tell that way. There was an atmosphere, of course, of great pain. There was also an atmosphere of celebration. Somehow Diego's life was there. MEXICO 1986 WORLD CUP My family is a family of political exiles who arrived in 1977. Four months later, I was born in Mexico City. Since '77, a group of exiles was formed that we got together as a community. The Argentine National Team set foot in Mexico City. ARGENTINA'S TRAINING SESSION MEXICO CITY, 1988 What a player, what a player! Some of the parents knew "the teacher" Signorini, he made us the connection and we, a group of children, entered the concentration. The training ended and the one who paid us the most attention at that time was Maradona. When he signed our autographs, he asked us where we were from and who we were. He knew we were children of exile, but he reaffirmed that. Through his magic, he made us fall in love with Argentina, be Argentines. He was like a San Martín, one of the last loyal warriors. He never forgot where he came from. When I was little, my first poster was of Diego Maradona with the Argentina National Team shirt. Every night when I went to sleep I looked at him and dreamed, not with meeting him, but with football, right? You have to let the Universe conspire. You have to release the idea and the dream must be there and the Universe will conspire to make it happen. The subject of the match comes up and Diego tells the boys that were there that they could mark him, they could follow him one, two, three at a time, as it happened, but the only one that they weren't going to find or mark was me because of how I played. Diego told them to pass me the ball, that he could be covered but they wouldn't find me, and that I was going to make the team work as he could. In the end, his words were fulfilled. Hi, my love! How are you, Tota? I love you, mama! Dear! We are living really exceptional moments. - I love you so much, mom! - Me too, my love. Go to rest, my son, today you have made me the happiest mother in the world. The WhatsApp group is called "Champions of '86" and I'm the administrator, that is, I can add and remove. I have that authority. When we were on the plane back, Diego came with the Cup, he did not want to let go of it. He didn't give it to anyone. If one wanted to take a picture with it, you had to... "Please, Diego, please!" At one point I think he fell asleep hugging the Cup. Wonderful, really. PLAZA DE MAYO, BUENOS AIRES, 1986 PLAZA DE MAYO, BUENOS AIRES 2020 I love you, Diego! Who was the best Maradona you ever met? The best Maradona? Don Diego! By far. The son played football better, but the best Maradona was Don Diego. The relationship between them was not one of many words. No! It was of many looks. It was very difficult to be estranged from my father, because he did not talk to you. You didn't know if his foot hurt, his knee hurt, his head hurt. He would let you talk. I had a lot of discussions with both of them, but one look is enough to say "I love you." He told me "I want to reunite with Don Diego." In fact, they practically did not speak to each other. I told Diego to go to Isla del Cerrito. We arrived at the pier, a very, very nice boat with a guide, we went fishing. I had no idea of the level of distance that was between the two. Until at one point he told me "Ask Don Diego if he's hungry." I got close to him and I said "Don Diego", Diego asks if you're hungry." "Tell him no." I go to the side, "He says no." Really very difficult. Until suddenly the "Kilómetro 11" song starts playing on the radio. Diego threw the fishing rod, Don Diego threw the fishing rod, he says "Pelu, listen", "Yes, do you remember when...?" And they hugged, hugged and cried, both of them. I hug them both, we all cry. And in the middle of the hug, Diego turns around, looks at me and says "Play it again." "How am I going to play it? It's a radio." They start to investigate, we find out what radio it was. "How's it going? Good afternoon, you just played the song "Kilómetro 11", I wanted to ask if you could play it again." They told me that they couldn't do it, I said "Look, I'm with Diego Maradona" and then there's a silence on the other side of the phone and the person didn't believe me. "Diego, here, ask him yourself." Diego grabs the phone, and says "Hello, how are you? Diego here." And we could hear on the other side "Diego Armando Maradona, on FM whatever...!" Of course! They played it fifteen times. NOVEMBER 26, 2020 11:00 A.M. DR. ALBERTO FERNÁNDEZ PRESIDENT OF ARGENTINA It was weird because on one side was his family around the coffin, mourning, and right next to it, the main political figures of the National Government began to parade with the intention to try to convince his family to extend the wake time. The line was getting longer with every passing hour. Thousands and thousands of people under the sun. I arrived and he was in 9 de Julio and Belgrano. A while later they begin to tell me that he was already on San Juan Avenue, then in Constitución. There was a very dense atmosphere. Argentina! Argentina! Argentina! Argentina! Argentina! Argentina! Argentina! Argentina! The guests made a line in the internal courtyards of the Casa Rosada and that led to a place next to where his family was around Maradona's coffin. They asked people not to take pictures and that they try to stay a few minutes only and move on. That allowed you to see those who entered from the street and to observe what was happening around Maradona's intimate circle. No, I had never been to the Casa Rosada. Seeing the people, seeing his family... Being there made us stronger as a group. On top of being our coach, he was our idol. We could greet his daughters and bring them flowers and leave him a flower. It still feels like it never stops hurting. I cried a lot, I thanked him for everything he had given me, what I had experienced with him. I still remember him in the best possible way. He was happy in Gimnasia, so I'm keeping that. NOVEMBER 26, 2020 2:45 P.M. FERNÁNDEZ DE KIRCHNER VICEPRESIDENT OF ARGENTINA Cristina came in around 3 p.m. It was an hour before everything was supposed to finish. She prayed there for a few minutes and at that moment her, the President and some others Government officials talked to Claudia, Dalma, Giannina and Jana and ask them to reconsider their decision, they tell them that there's a lot of people outside who want to come in and ask them to please extend the hours a bit. Claudia was in a mother role, being there trying to collaborate with her daughters, above everything else, in a very painful and overwhelming situation, which had nothing to do with processing their father's death. When Cristina Kirchner was already inside the Casa Rosada, what ends up detonating the situation is the moment in which they close the door. They closed the door and there was no one to take responsibility for that decision, nor the military nor Federal forces. As the finishing hour started drawing near, the access to Avenida de Mayo was closed. There was a reaction from some organized groups, the hooligan firms, that are used to confronting the police. What was supposed to be an expression of collective pain, but also a celebration of the idol, turned into repression of that people's demonstration. The absurdity is evidenced the moment when Alberto Fernández decides first to go out and yell at the people behind the fence, to ask them to wait, to have patience, they were going to be able to get in. Nobody could hear him and they gave him a megaphone! To the President... Listen, we're trying to organize more hours... Who controls the people's affection? How do you put limits, schedules, on that affection? It's difficult to put an end to something that depends more on those who are outside. I was in the Palm trees Courtyard when I saw that suddenly a lot of fans entered the courtyard. It was a kind of a surreal scene. If they had intended to break or steal something, it would have been a disaster. Obviously they didn't have that intention. Those who were in the street, who were more than a million, were a million Maradonas. They were there with grief because they knew that something more than a football player had died. Someone that represented them had died. At that time of the incidents, they decided to take him out of the room and take him back to the room where his close family had been that night. At one point, yes, I was afraid. A huge crowd, there was a lot of smoke. There was us, Diego's people, his entire family. His daughters, his sisters, everyone... Nephews, nieces... But Jana and I said "Let's put on music," and we put perfume on him. And everyone started to dance. He left with his music, and although it hurts to say it, he left with his whole family. He was in the coffin and all his people were there, hugging and dancing. At the last moment, he made it. It seemed that he was smiling, that he was happy that we are all there, united, as he liked so much. He was a person at peace. Deaths occur from natural causes, due to negligence or homicide. Which of these three possibilities is the one that determines what happened to Diego? I think that we are closer to the first one. Diego managed his life as he wanted, without letting his environment influence him so much. I would love to have many people face to face to ask them "Why?" "Why did you let him die?" "Why didn't you make sure that he had what he needed?" I thought he was going to have 20 nurses, 40 doctors, 14 ambulances. Money wasn't a problem. It will remain in each one's conscience what they didn't do. The Diego of the end was a Diego in loneliness. There was no friendly hand. They were all strange faces. He couldn't find Doña Tota, nor Don Diego, nor the girls, not even Claudia. He was running away from his own ghosts, which had been so many, and that practically nobody had discovered. After the loss of his parents, I think that, in a sense, he couldn't take it anymore. Couldn't and didn't want to. I believe that all of us, including myself, cried his death, not because of the impact of "How can Diego die?" but "How can a part of our lives die?" It was our own past that we were losing. NOVEMBER 26, 2020 5:45 P.M. The flag with La Tota never appeared again. It was that day that he arrived and not... It's probably with him, wherever he is. I said: "Diego, I want to take a picture with you with the Cup." We both posed, and Pedro Pasculli, who slept with him, gave us this photo, which is the best gift I have from that World Cup. My wife died in a car accident, one of the first calls I received was Diego's. It was really... We had a game against Vélez. That game, thank God, we won it and we dedicated it to him and everyone was so moved. We were playing "Chancho va". At one point he stole my card, he looked at me and said "The turtle got away from you." It was as if Romeo came and said "I love you, Juliet." They didn't forgive him that he had Che Guevara and Fidel Castro and met with Chávez and with Lula and with... No! He had to be a little puppet for the powerful, a fool with a colonized brain to be how the system wants to, as most of us are. Just as I have my kid's names, I have him here. And I wear it with great pride. It's a wish we all have. When we leave, my dad's barbecue will be on the table. My love, go to rest, my son, today you have made me the happiest mother in the world. AFTER A FIRST INVESTIGATION STAGE, SAN ISIDRO'S PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE CHARGED 7 PEOPLE FOR DIEGO MARADONA'S ALLEGED HOMICIDE WITH GROSS NEGLIGENCE. ALL OF THEM WERE OFFERED TO TAKE PART IN THIS DOCUMENTARY. ONLY THE THERAPIST, CARLOS DÍAZ, ACCEPTED THE OFFER. I used to tell him to let his hair grow long, because he had beautiful, curly hair, and he told me "Monona, I had curly hair" because I had a perm." - I love you, kid! -The day has come. - I love you so much! -Me too. He saw Passarella sitting there, and he walked over and asked for an autograph. Passarella told him "No, I'm not Daniel Passarella", I'm not Daniel Passarella." "You see? That's how River people are." When we were leaving, he tells me "The fish". I told him "Diego, why are we going" to take the fish? "We'll travel in a private plane." "We'll take them because I'm going to eat them with Don Diego." This lady is Diego's maternal grandmother. She smoked a pipe. Fiorito rules!
