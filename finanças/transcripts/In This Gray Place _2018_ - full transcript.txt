How did you come to be here in this gray place? Were you back in into the cold by something larger than you? You were flush and vibrant... now covered in mist, a wasted match stick. Were you deceived into life? Was your heart cut so untruly? Let me hold you... take you to the places not yet known, give to you the riches you lost. This, I promise. I promise. Can you hear me? Aaron? I'm here. I'm here. Now, breathe. Come on! - Hey, man, what's up? - Sam! I need you to come and get me right now. - Woohoo, slow down bro. - Sam, shut up! I need you right now, okay, right now. I'm in a rest stop off 26. - What are you talking about? - Off... Jesus Christ, are you for real, man? - Right now... - Chill out, okay. - Sam, now. - What happened dude? I'll tell you when you get here. Where? Rest stop off 26, come get me! - Jesus, just drive. - Drive? No. I... I don't have the truck. I'm in a bathroom and I'm bleeding. - I'm hurt... - You're what? If you have a kit, bring it, I don't care, just put your jacket on, get in your car and come and get me! Aaron, where's Elijah? Look, I'm just freaking out, man. Hello. Hello! - Shit. - Excuse me, sir. I'm Officer Burgess, can you step outside, please? Aaron, are you there? Appreciate your cooperation. Oh, yeah... - Sir? - Yeah, in a minute. Dude, what's going on? It's a cop, there's a cop. Last time I'm gonna tell you. I need you to come out... Tell him you're taking a piss. No, wait, I'm taking a piss. - Tell him you're using the bathroom. - Shut the fuck up. Step outside right now. Oh! Just... just give me a second. Open up! I'm ordering you! Open up. - Alright. I'm... I'm on the way. I'm coming! - Hurry up! - Stop resisting. - Where's Elijah anyway? - Open up right now! - Jesus Christ! You can't let him in. Just tell him to fucking go away - Open up, sir! - Aaron. Aaron. Aaron! Aaron. Aaron! Come on, Aaron! Answer me. Aaron! Pick up! Pick up the phone. Aaron! What the fuck, Aaron, come on? Answer me. Yeah. Holy shit, Aaron! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm... - Okay, I'm... I'm coming. - Please. - I'm coming, I'm on the way. - Yeah. I'll be there soon. Stay there. Yeah, okay. Okay, I'm on the way. Is this our beginning? So many of us, each unique, toiled, imprinted on the other, our whole lives ahead of us, free to choose, only parts of the greater whole marshaled into our place, so close, never to touch. Can you feel them? Billions of lives apart like us? Should it be across the cradle of time from every soul there ever was, mine would find yours? How is that anything but fate? Aaron? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. Aaron, I just got off the phone with Sam, he said... Yeah, yeah, it's okay. Oh! Are... are you hurt? No. - Goddammit, Aaron, talk to me. - I'm here. You gotta talk to me, baby, what happened? Sam... Is... is Sam coming for me? I mean, he called you, he's coming for me, right? Yeah, yeah, he said... he said that he's picking you at a rest stop somewhere. He said you're at some rest stop, but Aaron, he said... he said he heard gun shots. He said that you might be hurt. - He said that you're freaking out right now. - No, no, no, no. I don't want you to worry about that, okay? I don't want you to worry about that. I'm... I need you. My God, Aaron. What happened? I think I killed someone. Uhm... Okay. Okay. I think he might be dead. Uhm... Are you okay? I have to go. No, no, no, no, Aaron, you can't hang up on me right now, don't hang up on me, please... Baby, I love you. I love you so much, but I have to go, okay? I have to. Aaron, don't, please, do not hang up on me right now! You can't hang up on me right now, please... Hey, it's Vern. Sorry I didn't catch you. Leave it at the beep. This is some Shakespearean shit. Hello in there. Hello? How are you doing? I'm Lieutenant Arnold Koch. I'm here to talk with you. Can you talk to me? Look, I'm just here to talk with you, is that okay? Yeah. Great, good. First, I need to ask you if everyone in there is okay, if you're not hurt or anything? Get to the point. Is there anyone with you in there? Anyone? Hello? I have my girlfriend and you better... You better back the fuck up, man! Back it up! All right, please, listen to what I'm saying... No, you listen! Back the fuck up, man, you hear me? All right, all right. We're gonna work on a message to talk to you a little better, okay? Fine! Just give me some space! Back it up! Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Your soul was born in the heart of a dying star. You were not flesh. You were something more... elemental. Heaven beneath the soft earth. You were light made to breathe. Hey in there. Hello! Yeah. It's Arnold Koch. Yeah, Lieutenant Koch, got it. Hey, what's your name? Are you all right in there? Listen, man, I'm not giving you my name, and you're not getting in here. Do me a favor though, back up. I know you must be feeling scared, maybe regretful. - Now, I'd like to listen... - Mitch. Excuse me? Mitch. I'm gonna say my name is Mitch. It's my eighth grade algebra teacher. Your teacher? Did he mean a lot to you? You want a name, there you go. Okay then, Mitch, thank you. Hey, Mitch, I need to know how many people are in there. Well, it's me, my girlfriend, and fuck off! Mitch, if you don't help me, then I can't help you. These guys... Oh, you're pulling every trick in the book, man, every single trick! "Oh, you must be feeling scared and regretful." "Oh, did your teacher mean a lot to you?" "Oh, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch." Like you care what my name is. Let me make this shit as crystal clear as I can, Lieutenant! I'm not coming out and you're not getting in. And I swear to God, if you try and make a move, bitches die! Got it? I don't think bloodshed is the best way to end this, Mitch. Now, I'm here to help you. I wanna know your side of things. There's nothing you can do that you can't turn back from. Okay? You can turn this around. All you need to do is open that door. I don't think so, Lieutenant. The way I see it, this door is all I have right now. I think I'll hang on to it just a bit longer. Can you hear me? I'm here. Hey, it's Vern. Sorry I didn't catch you. Oh, this is Vern, I can't pick up right now because my phone is in my ass. - Hey, man. - Hey. - Are you here? - Yeah. Awesome. Listen, Sam, I need you to charge the cop. - What? - Bum-rush him. What? No dude. Listen, Sam, hit him. I can't get out of here unless I have... I can't do that, man, are you... are you nuts? Just do this for me, man. Just... We're almost at the finish line, okay? You don't understand, man, the place is crawling. - What? - Yeah, dude. I'd count like eight cop cars, Five-O's everywhere. Fuck! Fuck! Yeah, fuck is right. I thought it was just one dude. Stupid, stupid! Yeah, well, it ain't. Shit! Well, that fucks up my plan. What? Your plan was for me to hit a cop? Yeah, and run. Shit, shit, shit! What now, dog? I don't know yet, man, I'm thinking. Well, they look like they mean business, bro. I could see one dude, his gun pointed at the door. Don't fucking tell me there's a SWAT team. No. Good. What the fuck did you do, man, to piss them off? It's been a day. Yeah. Where's Elijah? He bailed. - Hey... - What? Sam, do me a favor. - I need you... - Bailed? Yeah. Sam, I need this favor, all right? Can you see the door? Yeah, the pisser, right? Yeah, see the holes? Holy shit, was that you? You did that? Kinda had to. Shit, man. Yeah. Can you like... Can you like... Can you see if there's blood on the door, can you see? No, man. No? I can't see anything. An ambulance, a fucking body bag, anything, anything at all? I see a dude with a camera snapping pictures. That's it. But listen, man, I gotta bounce, I gotta back off. It looks sketch as hell me sitting here like this. - And I'm carrying, so... - Yeah, do what you gotta do. We'll figure something out. All right? I ain't leaving you. I really appreciate it, man, thanks. I know, I'm a peach. Just... You okay? How does the light blind us? Carry us in its glow? Reveal to us the world? We live so little of its spectrum. Drink in so little of its warmth. Wrapped in it and blind to its nature. Hey, it's Vern. Sorry I didn't catch you. Leave it at the beep. Motherfucker. Mitch? Yeah. I still like to hear things from your point of view. You know, I don't really feel like talking. That's okay. It's okay. Okay then. You have a phone in there, Mitch? So what? Maybe we can talk together on the phone. You would think that would be easier. No, I need to take this. You need to talk with me, Mitch. We're talking, we're just talking. But right now, I wanna hear from your girlfriend, okay? Jesus, would you shut up? We have to know she's okay. She's fine! I'm making a phone call right now, give me a minute. We have to know she's okay. Piss off! - What the fuck, dude? - Vern, goddammit! I've been trying to reach you all night. I'm in a movie, bro. Well, you picked a hell of night, dumb shit. Elijah and I did our thing. Just now? I don't know, man, like an hour ago. Well, this ain't eBay. Okay? I can't exactly get rid of the jewels this fucking second. I thought you were waiting a few days anyway. Vern, shut the fuck up. Shit went south, man, real bad. Gone? Like motherfucker behind the counter pulled a knife, yes. Okay, okay, but you got this shit, right? Yeah, but... But what? I'm up the creek, man, the cops got me. What the fuck, you fucking... Vern, Vern, chill the fuck out, man. I'm not under arrest, I'm hiding. So, what? The cops know where you are? Where... where the fuck are you? I'm in a bathroom, man, fucking nasty ass bathroom and it's grimy. Fuck, man, can't believe you fucking tried to call me. You realize they're gonna trace this shit? I need your help. Listen, you're fucked. God can't even help you, man. You just bought yourself like twenty years, and right now, you're dragging me in it. I'm not gonna be in an accessory to your dumb ass. I know. I know, man. I just need to delay it. I just gotta keep those guys on the other side of the door just a little longer. Tell them you'll shoot yourself if they try to breach. Jesus, I'm in a lobby right now. Yeah? And I'm in a trucker's hell hole. But I can't tell them that, I told them I got a hostage. Are you fucking out of your mind? What? Goddammit, I can't believe this. You are such an amateur, you realize that? Vern, I need your help. I don't need your crap right now. - Just walk me through this. - Well... They're gonna wanna talk to the hostage, otherwise they'll breach, especially since they think you're dangerous. - Goddammit. - Heat. What? Heat. They have these heat cameras. They know the second there's someone else in there. All right. I got this covered, thank you. - Don't call me again! - Talk to you later. Can we go back? Cross out the punishment of years scratched into our hearts? Are we still alive here? An arrow cannot change its course. Like our very birth, do we have no choice in this? Are we the consequence of ourselves? Aaron! Laura, baby, you gotta listen to me. Okay? Aaron, what the hell is going on right now? Please baby, I don't have a lot of time, okay? - I want you to focus on... - What are you talking about? Will you shut up for a second! What do you mean you don't have a lot of time? What the hell does that mean? I know you have a lot of questions, and I'll answer them, baby. - I promise. I promise. - No, no, no, goddammit. No, Aaron, I'm not gonna be able to do anything until you tell me what the hell is going on right now. Laura, we don't have time for this. You said you killed somebody. You said you were hurt! Aaron? If you hung up on me again, I swear to God... Elijah and I were gonna do a job. You're with my fucking brother right now? Give him the phone? - Laura... - Give him the phone, Aaron. - I wanna talk to my brother. - He's not here. What do you mean he's not there? - He ditched you? - No, it's not like that. Yeah, of course he did, 'cause that's what he does, Aaron, 'cause he's a fuck-up. I love him to death, but he is. And he jumps ship at the sign of any sight of trouble. I mean, why do you think I told you not to get mixed up in his bullshit? I told you it's not like that. God, this is gonna break my mom's heart. What the hell did he get you into? - We need the money, it was... - Oh, my God! You did not kill someone for money? No, of course not, it's not like that. What the hell did Elijah drag you into? I went to him! It was supposed to be a quick in and out. Wait, what are you saying? What you've robbed a guy? Laura, we can make sense of this later, but right now... - I want to know right now. - I need your help. - None of this makes any sense, Aaron! - Please! Please. I need you to help me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now, baby, I need you to sound like you're scared. Scared? Like, I need you to sound like a hostage. Aaron, is this a joke? You want me to sound like a hostage? Trust me baby, please, okay? I need you to say, "I'm here, I'm okay." Aaron, I don't understand what's going on right now. Just say it, just... Just say it just like this, say, "I'm here, I'm okay." I'm here, I'm okay. Okay. Good. But I... I need it to sound more real. Do you know what I mean? I'm here for you, okay? I am okay, and I'm here for you. No, no, no, no. It's not about me. I need you to sound like you're scared. I need you to sound like you're stuck and like you're scared. Please. I need this. I need this bad, baby. Please do this for me. Please. I'm here, I'm okay. Good. I'm here, I'm okay. Louder, Laura. I'm here, I'm okay! - Again. - I'm here, I'm okay! - Again. - I'm here, I'm okay! - Again! - I'm here, I'm okay! - Say it! - I'm here, I'm okay! I'm here, I'm okay! Why are you making me do this? 911, what is your emergency? I need to talk with Lieutenant Koch right now. Lieutenant Arnold Koch. You need to call the station directly sir, this line is for... No, no! Damn it. I'm the guy. I'm the guy in the bathroom. You say you're in a bathroom? Yeah. Whatever, the standoff, I need to talk with Lieutenant Koch. So, transfer me, patch me through, do whatever you gotta do, okay? I gotta talk with him right now! Tell him it's Mitch, I've got a hostage... Damn it, lady! I'm the guy in the bathroom! Okay? Get me Koch now! Hold please. Mitch? I told you to give me time. I told you to back off. We need to hear from your girlfriend... I'm here, I'm okay! I'm here, I'm okay! Why are you making me do this? You heard her. She's here, she's okay. I haven't touched her. Okay, Mitch, that's... that's good. Thank you. Now, back off, Koch. I'm trying to sort shit out on my end, and I don't like you stepping. Now, Mitch, you know that we can't... Hey. Hey. What's up? Bad fucking news, man. What is it? SWAT? Yeah. These guys, like normal cops, just roll up. They're pulling gear out of the truck, man. Now, on TV they always got these big ass tanks, who are wearing like bad asses, but no, no, these guys, they just look like high school cops. What else is going on out there? Uh... Helicopter has been buzzing around. Uh-huh. There is a dog, no news crews or anything, I mean, not from where I am. Oh, where are you? Like five hundred feet away in a parking lot. Sam, do you see a guy in charge or a guy who looks like he's in charge? I've seen two guys who look like they're calling the shots. Do you think the SWAT team is gonna come get me? No doubt. I called to check on you. I'm okay. Bullshit. Right now, you need to tell me the game plan. Look, man, I don't have a plan, all right? I gotta come up with something. Aaron, come on! Dude, just come on, just put the gun down, kick the shit to the side, just walk out of here alive. Hold your hands up and walk out. I want to, Sam, okay? Believe me, I do, but it's not that simple... Cut the shit, Aaron. Listen goddammit, you got a shit hand dealt to you right now, but it's fucking better than getting killed. It's bad luck, I know, but you can get out of this. I mean, what about me, asshole? What about Laura, you're gonna walk away from that? I mean, this is stupid. No. Look the longer this goes on, the more likely the cops kill you. No, you don't get it. What don't I get? What don't I get? I know what the score is. I know this basically means I'm a goner. - No, no, no, no. - It's for her. These rocks, I gotta get them to her. - You gotta think about you! - I'm going in! Forever! I can't be thinking about me, she's gotta be taken care of! That's why me and Elijah did it in the first place, for Laura. So, I can't give up to the cops. That's why I can't surrender! Not now! I need more time. For what exactly? To hide the shit. I need... I need to get it to you. Oh, hell no. Listen, man, if I can stash it or get it to you or to Vern, you can get it to Laura. I can't provide for her if I'm locked away. You... Oh, do you wanna hold up the cops while you bury your treasure? Yeah. Christ on a cracker. Oh, you got a better idea? Yeah, give up. It doesn't seem like you're gonna hear me out on that. No. Listen, just... just give me some time to come up with something. Right. Thanks, pal. Hey, it's Vern, sorry... What? - Sam and I are working on a... - You called Sam? ...working on a plan to get the rocks to you. I'm hanging up. If you hang up, I swear to God I will have Sam show up at your place and beat you to death, Vern. Oh, that's very scary. Listen, you fucking ruined my movie, you're a dick. I'm getting Sam the rocks. How quick can you turn it around? The cops will be hard to try it. This shit takes time. Next time, don't fuck up the job. Why did you call Sam? Why not Elijah, this shit is for his sister, isn't it? How quickly can you get it turned around, Vern? Maybe forty-eight hours. And you can get the money to Laura? Yeah, but I'm taking a bigger cut. Fine. Start setting it up. Sam will get you the goods, do not fuck this up for me. Fuck! Was it you to set this in motion? Was it your hand guiding us in this life? What are you doing? Was it your stone cast to cause these ripples? Did you choose this? I'll kill you! Can you hear me? Fucking cop! Oh God! - Yeah. - Hello, Aaron. It's taken you longer than I expected. Aaron, I think you should know the Sheriff's Department is here. They wanna speak with you. Fuck you. You're talking with me. I'd love to talk to you. I'd love to listen to you, Aaron, but you haven't been talking to me. Oh, fuck. Aaron, you know my name. You traced my number. Calling was the smart idea, it was a good thing to do. Aaron, can you tell me if your girlfriend is okay? Fuck you, Koch. You're trying to get someone killed in here, aren't you? Aaron, there was an incident up the road. You know anything about that? Yeah. Will you tell me about it? My lungs are on fire. If you wanna talk with me, don't gas me, dick. She's fine, we'll be okay. Don't try that shit again. Get it? Can you hear me? Aaron? I'm here. Now breathe. I will give you half the take for one drop. I am the world's best friend, you know that? What did you do? The woods, man, near the bathroom, on the other side from the cops? Like... the woods, the trees? Yeah, the woods. Yeah, the woods, you know? Cops are in the parking lot, and then the road, there's like the road. But on the other side there's like a ditch, man. Sam, Sam! Yeah, it's like ten feet or so, man. There's a big ditch and then a bunch of trees. Damn it, man! I can't fit through that window. It's too small, that'll be too slow, they'll grab me in a second. You? Hmm, not... not you, screw you. You're going to jail. Well, thanks, world's best friend. Well, dude the jewels. The jewels, man, toss them out the window, I can pick them up, and, you know, I'll slip in real quiet like. No, Sam... For fuck's sake, Aaron! But they'll spot you, dude. Then make a big ass distraction for me, would you? Toss that shit through the window, I'll be waiting in the trees, when the coast is clear, I'll snag it. And it goes to Laura, okay? Well, Elijah gets his cut, so does Vern, and so do I, fucker, 'cause I'm dodging cops too. Okay, and the rest goes to her. By the way, Vern's been a dick, so don't let him get handsy with his cut. I got you, dog. Do what you gotta do. Hey. I called Elijah, but he isn't answering, so... I called Sam. Aaron, are you there? Yeah, I... of course. You talked to Sam? Yeah. He didn't mention that. He said that you're surrounded by the police right now. No, no, baby, baby, I'm almost... I can't do this. No, no, no, it's fine. Sam and I are... I can't do this, Aaron! I can't do this! I can't sit around waiting for you for my entire life. No. I don't want your blood money. Did that ever occur to you? Did it cross your mind that I don't wanna sit around and pay bills with blood money while you rot away in prison for the rest of your life? You're kidding me right now? Do I sound like I'm fucking kidding? I've gone through hell for you. Sam is outside right now putting his life on the line for you. I don't give a hot fuck about Sam! I don't care about Elijah, I don't care about Sam, I care about you, Aaron! And I can't live with this money knowing what you did to get it. Laura... I'm sick of it. My back is breaking, my knees have gone to hell. I am sick of digging holes for fence posts and stacking boxes, scraping by at eight bucks an hour at a grindy-ass job. Laura, I want a life. I want a house with you. I wanna drive a car not ride a bike. Laura, I wanna sleep in. I wanna wake up every morning and see you there. I wanna give you the life you should've had. I gave you everything I am, and it cost me everything I could've been, but that's okay. Because you will go on and at least I will know, at least in quiet minutes, that you're gonna be okay. Okay. I gotta go. Okay. I love you. Promise you'll call back. I love you. Aaron. Yeah. You feeling okay? Not even close, Mr. Koch. Is your girlfriend there? Why don't you tell us her name? Jesus, man, you're relentless. Laura. Her name is Laura. The Sheriff's guys want me to ask you about that incident up the road. I'm sure you have it very well figured out. Look, I'm sure you must feel like we're trying to set a trap for you, but the truth is... You gassed me, bro. We're not friends right now. Aaron, if we cannot confirm that Laura is okay, these deputies are coming through the door. We need reassurances. Shit. Let me tell you how this is gonna work. You're gonna back the fuck off or I'm coming out shooting. Aaron, you sound to me like a real smart guy who ran into some real bad luck. Like you give a damn. I do. Look, it's my job to make sure we all walk away from this alive. Now, please give me something to ease these guys up. Piss off. Do you care about her? Uhm? Aaron? Don't you wanna see her safe? Yes. Then let her go. - I can't do that. - Why not, Aaron? I don't know. I don't know. Aaron, if you don't give me something, if you don't give me something now, they'll breach, they'll come in there. I'm doing my best to help you. How is he? Excuse me? The cop, how is he? Who? The guy I shot. It's... Did I kill him? What was his name? He's absolutely fine. What? Yeah, he's okay, Aaron. You didn't hit him, you missed, he's okay. You didn't kill anyone. It's okay to come out, Aaron. Oh, God, please, please. This world wasn't made for you. It has dirt in its seams. Come on. Come on. It's too weathered to live under a light like yours. Your soul... clung to a dirty window. Hello. Aaron! Jesus, I thought something happened. I'm sorry. I've been calling, man. Oh... Yeah. I'm in position. Huh? Outside. Just outside in the trees, the cops can't see back here, they aren't looking. Dude, come on. I can't really see. I'm right here, I'm right here, see me? No, I can't see. I don't see you. I don't have a good vantage. Oh, scrooge. Toss me the money. Which way? What? Which way do I throw it? I'm just in front of you, just in front of you. Give me a minute. There're cops everywhere, man, this is stupid! It'll work, just do it, come on. - Fuck! - You just gotta be quick. Aaron. Okay, let me try something. You need to hurry, man, I don't think I could be here that long. Dude, what are you doing? Stop messing around, hustle up. - I think I see you. - Okay, finally. Throw me the bag. Aaron. Oh, come on. What happened? Aaron? Can you hear me? Aaron? I'm here. What? Hello? Aaron? I fell down. Can you call for help? - Can I? - No. Where are you hurt, Aaron? Can you tell me where you're hurt? I feel lit at my teeth. Oh, my God, baby. I can't... I can't... Stop, hey, hey, just take... take a deep breath, okay? Just take a deep breath, Aaron. Come on. Okay, good. Good, good. Now, now just listen to the sound of my voice, okay? Just listen to me. All right? You're fine. Now, breathe. It's okay, it's okay. I'm so sorry. No, you're okay. I told you I'd be right here. I don't know what to do. You're too good. I never earned it. I don't deserve you. Tell me why. For us. No. There wasn't a choice. Is this your fate? That you have no choice? I love you. Tell me why. - My sister, Laura. - Hey. Stop it, go away. Did you do it? You did it! For us. I love you. I love you. I gotta go. Oh, no, damn it. Damn it. Come on, don't do this to me. Why should the universe arrange itself for you? You... one of many, no more or less than the other. What is a single tear in a life of sorrow? A joy? Is it destiny that rearranges us, that forces us together? Through this chaos are we shaped, is it chance? Choice? Faith? Hello. What did you say happened to Elijah? Vern. I just tried calling him. What? Elijah, I tried calling him. - Vern... - Fuck you, Aaron. You know who picked up? The cops. No, it's... it's not like that. You left him, didn't you? You left him behind. No. Yes, you did. No wonder they were on your trail, you grabbed the goods and you bailed on Elijah, and that's what you meant when you said, "We got separated," you piece of shit. - Vern. - You ditched him, didn't you? You don't understand. I tried telling you, things went south. You're a fucking coward. Vern, I can explain it to you. Fuck you! I'm not helping you. It's not for me, it's... I can't believe you'd fucking do that to Elijah, man. I hope they nail you to a cross, you spineless piece of shit. Please. Fuck! We got someone over here. Freeze, Sheriff's Department. - Aaron! - Sheriff's Department! Sheriff's Department, get down on the ground. Sheriff's Department! Stop resisting. Sam. Yo, Aaron, Aaron! - Sam! - Get down, get down on the floor right now. Knock down the door. Hurry! - Let me see your hands. - Let me go, dude. Sam! Hello. Aaron. Sam! I'm sorry, bro. No, no, no. - No, it's... it's me, I should... - Aaron... It's time to come outside, man. It's over. Put him on. Oh, please, buddy, I'm asking you. Sam, put him on. Hello, Aaron. Let him go. Your friend wants the same thing we want, Aaron. I think it's time to come out now. You haven't made any demands all night. You've kept your head on your shoulders. I shot at one of your guys. But you've been talking with me. No, I can't do that. Aaron, we know it's just you in there. What? We know you've been calling Laura all night. We know she's not in there. You were looking after your guys, that's why you haven't tried to breach again. We're looking after you, Aaron. Go easy on Sam. Fuck off. Please, Vern, don't hang up. It's not for me, it's for Laura. It's absolutely for you. Vern, the cops can come in here any minute and kill me. - Good! - Goddammit, Vern! In ten minutes, I'm gone for good, all right? This isn't a fucking joke! Oh, it's the biggest fucking joke I've ever heard. You are, you are the joke. If you don't help me out, it was all for nothing. Vern, it was for nothing, but you can make it worthwhile, okay? You can, right now, you can make all of this worth something. - It'll be a cold day in hell. - Goodman it. What happened to Elijah? What happened to him? You have to come here. After they take me away, you have to come back here and get the money. All right, I'll rope it off or something... Aaron! Vern, me, Elijah, Sam, we got it this far, okay? Right? And we're counting on you. Laura, Laura is counting on you, all right? This is why you're here, man, it was... it was you all along. Right? It was you, you were the last piece of the puzzle. All right? And I'm begging you. I'm begging you right now, please. Vern, please, help me. Please, help Laura. No, no, no, I'll leave some cash in the bag, all right. I'll throw them off the trail for a bit. They'll think that's everything. By the time they realized I stashed some stuff away, it'll be too late. You see? Now, you gotta be quick back here, and you need to pick the rest. Okay. But you have to tell me. Tell you what? The truth. Aaron. Yeah. I'm here. Why did you leave Elijah behind? He was shot. I didn't think you'd call back. It won't be long now. Please surrender, Aaron. I need to tell you something. Okay. Elijah. What about him? Aaron? Aaron, what about him? Aaron! I'm here. What about Elijah? He's dead. What? No, no... No! Oh, my god. Oh, my God. No! No, no! No! No, no. I don't understand. I have to tell you, Laura. No! I don't understand. What happened? Laura. Tell me what, Aaron, what happened? I wanted to tell you sooner. Aaron, what happened? What happened? No... What happened? Aaron, what happened? On the ground everybody, down! - On the fucking ground! - Get down on the floor. - Whoa, whoa. - Get down on the fucking floor. Don't look at me, stay on the ground. The drawers! - Alright, alright. - Open the jewel cache. - Open your bag! - Get back. Give me all the cash you have. - That's it? That's it? - Yeah. Son of a bitch. Eli, what the fuck are you doing? What are you doing, bro? Go get the stuff. - Fuck, man. Don't... - Go get it! Eli, I've got... Oh, God! Eli, no. No! - Eli! - No! - Eli, don't! - No! Eli! Laura. Aaron... What... What have you... Aaron, no. Aaron. You killed him. You killed him. Eli is not... You killed my brother? Yes. Why, why, why? - Why, why, why? - It was only to help. He's gone. It was only supposed to help. Elijah's gone. Laura... There is nothing I wouldn't give to trade all this. - You killed him. - I had to. You asked about destiny, well, this is mine. I didn't ask for this, Aaron, I don't want this. And I'm giving up my life for you, my freedom for you, everything for you. I didn't want to either. But I had to. I'd stop Elijah hundred times if it meant protecting you. Laura... I'd do it again if I had to. I'm gonna be sick. You have to take it. You have to take the money. What? No! I can't think about it. No, not I'm not gonna take it, I won't take it. - I don't want it. - You have to. I can't... How, Aaron, how could you do this and still say you love me? You don't love me. You don't love me. You don't love me. I have nothing left to give. I have nothing left to give you. And somehow you managed to take everything away from me. I only wanted a future. We had a future. It may not have been bright, but it was ours. You have to take it. Take it. Promise, promise me, Laura. Promise me, Laura! Promise me! I promise. Now, breathe. Aaron! Aaron! Come back. I'm here. I'm still here. I promise. I promise.
