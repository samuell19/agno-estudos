Sit there. Oi, hold this. OK. Flat to the stone. And you're gonna pull it back. Come here. Try again. Put the pressure on. Just guide it. There you are. OK. Ow. All good. It's OK. Don't want to lose any of the golden blood, yeah? Dad! Dad! You want to steer us out of here? Ready? Oh! You have a good time today? - The best. - Yeah? Ouch. Hmm. Did you eat some fish? No. Deer. So good. What happened to his finger? What was that? What happened to his finger? Oh, it's just a nick. He'll be fine. Hey. How are you feeling? - Fat. - Yeah? Mm-hm. Want me to sand it a little back? How are you doing in there? Doing OK? She's not moving. She's asleep. OK. That's a wonderful thought. Sleep inside of you. How's it coming along? Yeah, it's good. Be finished by the time she's 16. Hey. Gotta go to bed. Did you have a good time with me camping? Yeah. Yeah, I did too. What is it? Will I be brave like you one day? Like me? There's many ways to be brave. Like… like remember when I told you to shoot the deer, you said no? And when you said that, you were kind of scared that you were gonna disappoint me. But you said it anyway. That's being brave. Get some sleep. Get some sleep. Ah, get in. Tuck you in like a burrito! Ouch. It's hot. I heated it up a bit. Are you trying to cook me? - Like this? - Yeah. And what is this meant to do again? Um… supposed to prevent stretch marks. Yeah, not working. Fuck you. OK here. Shh. Is it time to get up? Sh…sh… Mummy's asleep. OK. Come here. Come here. Yeah. Cool. OK. Don't look. What's in your sandwich? Jam? - Chicken? - Yes! Remember what to do? Got to do it nice and gentle. Nice and gentle. Squeeze it tight. Tight. There you go! That's the one. - Kelly? - Nup. - Kelly, that's nice. - Nup. Okay? - Um… - Ah… Kiana. - Kiana? - Yeah. - That's not a name. - Yes it is. - You made it up. - That's your friend... No, it's your friend from netball. Kiana. The tall one. Goal…goalkeeper. Goal attack. GA. Kiani. Not Kiana, Kiani. I've been calling her Kiana. Oh, that's her… that's the wrong name. Why hasn't she said anything? Who calls themself Kiani? What does that mean? Honey, you're such an asshole. Why am I an asshole? She's the one… - This whole time? - You'd think… My name… Sorry, you've been calling me the wrong name. My name is Kiani. You got any idea what you're gonna say to these kids? I got no idea. Probably the same shit you dribbled to me. Yeah. Just be honest, son. No, we're all just men. None of us is Superman. We're not made of steel. We're not invincible. Just trying to walk a line between courage and fear. Pure courage is… taking on a task that you're ill equipped to do. The job of the instructors here is to equip you for any situation you find yourself in the field of duty. We minimise the fear by the repetition of training. Pure courage is minimised… because it needs to be. Because in the face of fear your actions and decisions can be compromised. And you're in near the end? Right? - Right? - Yeah. Yeah. That's good. But we're still gonna push you physically and mentally harder than you ever thought possible. You just gotta keep your line. You just gotta keep the line. Just gotta try and keep your line. That's it. Mate, are you right? Ambulance. Yeah. Just please don't go. When then? And just as a final thought, Your Honour, I'd ask you to take into consideration the upheaval this young man has faced over the past seven years. He's been to six schools. Lived in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and now here. And what are the reasons for that? His father, Your Honour, has had trouble finding fulfilling employment since leaving the army. - Is your father here, son? - Yes, Your Honour. Mr Logan? Yes, Your Honour? So did you see active service, Mr Logan? Yes, Your Honour. Well, I had an uncle in the Army, served in Vietnam… He…well, he struggled in the years after. I'm fine, Your Honour. Now, hear me out, Mr Logan. Now, look, I have read over your son's offences. Now this is the third time that he's appeared here. It was stealing, drug possession and now destruction of property. And all occasions he's been picked up by the police after some days away from your care, that being, he's run away. And I also read here that his mother passed away eight years ago, so it's only you? Yes, Your Honour. Mr Logan, I sympathise with your situation. I've seen your struggle firsthand. You're also a single parent, but the situation with your son is dire. And by that, I mean, if he appears before this court again, he'll either be sent away or taken from your care. Now that's the process. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, Your Honour. And son, do you understand this? Yes, Your Honour. Good. You're free to go Mr Logan. Thank you. - Bow, bow. Missed 10 days over one term. Does that sound right? Yeah. Billy… could you wait outside for a moment? Thank you. Mr Logan, paying the amount of money that one does for school like this doesn't guarantee anything. What do you mean? What I'm saying is… Billy could be just as well suited to a good public school. You don't want him. It's not about what I want. He doesn't seem to want to be here. Does he? Mr Logan… you haven't paid last term's fees. All I'm saying is there are good alternatives. He might be happier at a public school. It might be better for him and easier for you. I'll make sure that I pay what's outstanding. And he won't miss anymore school. Hey, here he is! You look thin. - Do I? - Yeah. What have you done to your fucking hair? What you don't like this? Well, it's good on you. But I did try that, mate, I looked like a fuckwit. So you came home, eh, mate? Yeah. Better job. See her and, you know, kid's in school. They're buried here. Well, it's really good to see you, son. Billy good? How's Layla? Na, she sort of cut me off. She ended up fucking some bloke she worked with. Big fat cunt. I followed him, he's one of those guys that gets all dressed up in lycra to ride his bike on a weekend. I nearly run the fucker over. - But you didn't? - No I didn't, Corporal. Your daughters… you had two of them? How are they doing? Ah, they don't talk to me. Sorry to hear that. No, what can you do? You know, I thought about going back bush there for a little while, you know, going home. Good idea. Why didn't ya? Me mum and dad died and then… there's no work. Me brother and me sister, you know, them they… they fucked off, there's just no one there I knew. What about your boy? How old's he now? He's a teenager. Fuck. What's he like? Like a teenager. Does he listen to you? Nup, it's hard being a soldier, when you're not a soldier. No cunt will listen to you. What are you doing for work? What do you do? I'm a sales rep. Yeah… what about you? You… still doing the same thing? It's what we're good at, Corporal. And I haven't got enough room in my brain to learn other things. One of the reasons I want to see you, son. Wanted to know if you'd be interested in doing something with me. I need your help, son. Alright. So we can stop talking this kind of shit now and talk about stuff that really matters? Look, I need help. One night, right? In and out. Zero rounds. That's it. Just fucking think about it. Stay with me, mate. Mate, you gotta stay awake. Hey buddy. You're doing well. Yeah, his pressure's 80 over 30. His pulse's thready. - We need to move quickly. You can start the transfusion. What's the status of the baby? You got shit in the corner of your mouth. What's that? Nothing. 2009… It is for drinkers who enjoy rich, mouth-fill… It's for drinkers who enjoy a rich mouth-filling wine with plenty of fruit and flavour. Hey mate. Hi, I'm Ryan Logan, I work for Playfords. I'm the new rep. Just thought I'd come by introduce myself and get you to check out some of the specials we've got this month. What happened to the other bloke? Um… I dunno. Um… So we've got a sauvignon blanc, right, earthy tones, real leathery on the palate. Mate, you want to tell me about the specials, you call in make an appointment, it's how we do it. OK. What's a good day that I can make an appointment? You make a phone call, make an appointment. And then we get there. Is there someone else I could talk to maybe? Because, you know, we've got some great tempranillos, have you ever heard of them... Just fuck off. Um… I'll just leave you with this. Thank you for your time. Now, you ever talk to me that way again I'll cut you so deep and so much you'll need a fucking team of dress makers to put you back together, do you understand? Yeah. This one time, we had this Afghan, we were interrogating him. He was…Taliban. You know what that is? Yeah. Anyway, we had to… transport him to another province, so the Afghan interpreter, he fucks off. And I take the cuffs off this fella so I can take him to the helicopter. And gets his arms free… and first thing he does he goes for my rifle. Fuck was I supposed to do? Did he die? Did my dad ever kill anyone? Your dad was a sniper, son. Hey… Your dad's a fucking hero. You understand? Yeah. Do you ever think about the guy you killed? Oh… it's strange, you know, you… you kill someone and… after you wonder just how the fuck your paths crossed, you know? How people get into situations where someone's gonna die. It's always someone you've never known, someone you don't know a fucking thing about. And that poor cunt had never seen me before that day, and I'm the one that turned out his light. Just like that. Johnny. Corporal. Hey. Talking to your young fella, mate. He's all grown up. Yeah. Here. How'd you know where I lived? I had you under surveillance. You didn't give him a beer did you? - No. - Good. What do you want, Johnny? You know what I want, mate. Just want to have a chat. He's a growing boy, he's gotta eat. How about I meet you down the pub? Yeah, yeah. Hey… really good to see you again, son. Yeah. Should be proud, mate. See you down there, brother. What was he talking to you about? Nothin'. He's just… just telling me stories. Yo. You alright? Yeah, I'm good, son. John, I'm gonna pass. I'm not interested in this. Whatever it is, you know, it's not for me. Yeah OK. No Drama. OK. Hey… to be honest, I didn't expect to hear that, Corporal. You forgotten about Tony McManus? No. No. And I did that 'cause I love you. Because you're my brother and you'd done the same thing for me. Wouldn't ya? Son? That felt good at the bottle shop today, didn't it? Who the fuck did he think he was talking to? He doesn't know you. None of them do. Every party he went to. Rooting at 14. - Your dad? What? No way. - Yes. - That's a lie. It's bullshit. - You're full of shit. No mate. Swear. Swear to god. What the fuck do you want, Logan? My dad was in the SAS. Sure. Bit of a badass is he? He go to war and shit? Yeah. He kill people? He was a sniper. He's like a hero. Says who? The other soldiers. Do you reckon you're some type of hero as well? No. Lay off it, Jesse. Do you wanna sit down? Sit down. Fuck alright. You going to the party Friday? - Yeah. - Are you? Yeah, let's go. Anyone else coming you know? Hmm few of those chicks from friend group over the side of the back of the hall there are going. Oh yeah, yeah. They're alright. You asked him. And what do you do when you don't have this? Not much, just ride dirtbikes. Same as always, Corporal. Yes sir. Ah fuck! Stay there. Sh sh. Hey hey. You listen to me, you will give me the fucking code. You see these? I don't get the code the next one I'm not gonna fucking break, mate, I'll cut that fucker off. - OK. OK. OK. OK. - Quietly cunt. What's the code? 3-5-6-4-5-6. Shh. Sorry, Johnny. Fuck, Ray. Fuck. Bring him in. Corporal, bring him in. Corporal we don't have fucking time, bring him in. We have to go right fucking now, so bring him inside. Tell me that didn't feel good? You must miss that, son? Being a soldier. Fucking IED. That's it, you're out. Now you said no rounds? Fuck him. It was in his knee. I heard two pops. You're hearing things, Corporal. Yeah, I don't really want to know what it's all about, so… Yeah, right. When have you ever really known? Missed you at Jacko's funeral. I missed ya. You ever thought about doing that? Billy. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for tonight, son. Thank you. He said you threatened to cut him. Is that right? Mate, you cannot be talking to customers like that. Can't be talking to anyone like that. Do you understand that? Yes. Can I ask exactly what prompted you to say something like that? It was just the way that he spoke to me. Like what? Like, I was… just a… Yeah, I get it. Yeah mate, I've gotta be honest, I just didn't see this coming. I mean, you haven't… you haven't set the world on fire with your numbers, but your effort, mate, your effort's been brilliant. Now, look, the shop owner… the shop owner will accept an apology, right? Can you do that? We apologise. We put it down to having a bad day and we move on. Can you do that? Yeah. Yeah, I can apologise. But what I can't do is promise you that I won't do it again if someone speaks to me that way. You can't speak to people like that with so fucking little respect. I'm sorry, Ryan, I can't. Can't risk it, mate. Not after I've just warned you, I'll end up without a job. Sorry. It's cool, man. It's cool. Thank you for the opportunity. - What a bitch, bro. - Shut up, Brad. It's good, eh? Want some? I can't. - Why can't you? - 'Cause he's a fucking pussy. Just do it. Doesn't have to do it if he doesn't want to, boys. Shit, I'm sorry. Chill out. Fuck, sorry, Brad. Thank you. For before. Yeah, all good. It's fine. They can be dickheads sometimes. You know, I've had it before. Hm. Been to court for it. For real? Yeah. Some other shit. One more time and I get taken away. Taken away where? Juvie, I guess. Doesn't that scare ya? Isn't juvie like…jail? I don't know. Isn't your dad SAS? Wouldn't he be really strict? He's pretty useless now. Not like he used to be. - Fuck. What happened there? Car accident. That's gnarly. - Sorry. - Oh…you can touch it… if you want. Fucking weird eh? Having a party at my old man's house on Friday night. He's away for the weekend. You want to come? Really? Yeah, it'll be fun. Bunch of drinks. Different people. Girls. It'll be mad. What are you gonna do? You're failing him. - So how many is that? - 8 or 9, I think. Well mate, you're a better man than me. 'Cause the last proper job I had was selling fucking power tools. It was fucking great. Boss was a fuckwit wouldn't look me in the eye. Told me I had to wear an eye patch. Like a fucking pirate. Yeah, like a fucking pirate. So I knocked that cunt out at Christmas party and was fucking dismissed. You know, if you've got anything that I can help you with, sir, it'd be great. I got some money, that's Billy's for his school, I can't touch it, but I just need a little bit for the normal civilian shit. And I don't think my pension's gonna cut it and I'm certainly not gonna win it off a 10 to 1 beef rocket, am I? Son, you don't have to explain anything to me. Yeah, but I… it's a bit embarrassing asking. I got something for you. I've got something you can keep an eye on for me. - Twitchy fucker I don 't trust. - You don't trust many people. I trust you, son. So yeah, if you want it, it's yours. You going hunting? Do you want to go hunting? You know, with me, like before. Do you remember how to sight a rifle? Kind of. Go on then. - Dad? - Mm-hm? Can I go out tonight? Where? A house. Who with? Friends from school. You gonna come back? Yeah, I promise. OK. Thanks. But thank you for asking me. Oi Jesse, skull it you dog! Go on. Go Jesse. Logan and Brad. 3-2-1. Logan's got a squirter! - You cheated, bro. - Fuck off. That's what I do cunt. Fuck off. Good on you brother. I'm just saying, whoever done this were trained like you. I mean, boys said it was like two fucking ninjas come through the joint. And you know, Ray. No. You know fucking Ray. Alright, if you say so. Right, well he copped it. Dead. That's no fucking good is it… Ned? Boys said the door were locked too, so someone's picked that. Look, I'm just wondering… if you know anyone else out there in the game, that's got the same skill set as you? I mean, it could have been you. You've been there before, you know what's in there. Maybe you swiped the keys. We're not saying that, John. Man, that's exactly what I'm fucking saying. Listen… I didn't fucking take anything. I didn't go into your fucking apartment, I didn't open any fucking safe, I didn't pick any fucking lock. I work for you. Last I checked. Come on, Ned, are you gonna trust this cunt? Fucking look at him! Mate, I am telling you. Mate, I'm having a chat, right? I never liked Johnny. I never fucking liked ya Johnny. - Fuck... - We're having a beer. We're having a chat, alright? Just relax. Fucking relaxed. This is me relaxed. What are you doing? This is how you're taking care of it? Oh! I'm driving. Bullshit, Jesse, you had your turn. Why the fuck do you get to decide? It's my dad's car. Are you up for it, Logan? Don't be a soft cock now, Logan. - Get the fuck in the car. - What are you scared of mate? - Come on. - Everyone's had their go. Get in the car. - Yeah, come on mate. - Don't be a pussy. Get in there, mate! Please don't say anything. Oh Billy. Slow down. Where are you? You OK? Yeah. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna go to the cops? Dad's fucking gonna kill me. Look at it, it's fucked. I'm sorry. We're in so much shit. It's fine, we were just passengers. Billy was driving. Sit down. - Did anyone see you? - No. No one came by? - No. - No? Whose car is it? - It's my dad's car. Anyone know you got it? Who was drinking? Were you drinking? I was drinking, Dad. Get in the car. Billy! Unlock the door! Billy! Open the door! - No! - Open the door now! Fuck off! Hey. Hey. Look at me. Look at me. OK. OK. Yeah, mate, yeah. About seven. Righto. - Can I help you? - I'm Ryan Logan, Billy's dad. Right. You better come in then. You were in the army my son tells me? - Yeah. - You serve in Iraq? Yeah. Well, we shouldn't have fucking been there, should we? So, where's my car? I burned it. I beg your pardon? I burned it, it was a write-off. Figured you'd have insurance. So you want me to say it was stolen and then torched? Do you know what I do for a living, soldier? I'm a solicitor. Principal at a law firm. Very fucking prestigious one. Do you have any idea what would happen if I made a false insurance claim like the one you've set me up to make? And upon the mandatory investigation of the claim, it was found to be fraudulent… I could go to jail. At the very least I wouldn't be practicing law ever again. My son said your boy's a fucking ratbag. OK. He's already been in trouble with the cops. Yeah. Your boy… he was pissed. They were all drinking. Yeah, they might have been drinking, but they didn't get behind the fucking wheel of a car, did they? My car. Yeah. You need this to go away? Please. Sorry, I can't help you. To claim on my insurance, I need to be honest. But here's some free counsel. As far as the fire goes, I'd let that fall on your son's shoulders. Sounds like he's in enough trouble already. And there's no upside in you admitting to that. OK, so the police are gonna be involved? Of course. What if I pay for the car? Do you know what a car like that is worth? I'll get you the money and then you just leave it alone. Yeah? You get me the money, we'll see what we'll see. In the meantime, tell your boy to find some new friends. I don't need my son hanging around with trouble. Just give me a couple of days. Thank you for your time. Hey. Hey, come here, son. Alright, just take a breath. Look at me. Just take a breath, you'll be alright. - OK? - Yep. I got you. You understand? Mr Logan. Yeah? Mr Logan, your wife and your son are both in the RH null blood group. There's no RH antigens. Yeah, that's right. So you're aware of what the problems with that are? Yeah, they give blood all the time. They have to. It's here. So there's not enough blood. There's some on the way, but we don't have enough time. They're both bleeding internally and your son has ruptured his spleen. Your wife… she's lost the baby. OK. And she has severe head injuries. She's bleeding from her liver from her entire gut. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, well, give them the blood. How is the baby? The baby's died. OK? So there's not enough blood for both of them. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Yep. OK. Dad? Dad? Yeah. - I'm finished. - Good to go? Yeah. It's Mum who you talk to, isn't it? Wish I could talk to her. I miss her. I gotta find another place to drink, every fucker looking at me like I've got three heads. I need more money, John. Alright, son, whatever I can help you with. It's not a small amount. - How much? - Couple hundred thousand. I don't even know if I can pay you back. It was something Billy did and I need to… Sh sh sh. Hey, I don't need to know. Corporal… there's a way to get this done. But you have to engage. You understand? So you let me know, son. I'm here. Let's get it done. Yeah. Yeah? There he is. Boys. Search him. - Let me. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mate, I haven't got anything. Look, nothing. Nothing here. Nothing. Johnny, can you do us a favour mate? Please explain to us, please, why the fuck?! Are you stupid, man? Are you slow in the head? No. Because I could. That's it. That's your fucking answer? 'Cause you could? What do you want me to say? Because it's dirty money? 'Cause you're drug dealers? I don't give a fuck about any of that. See, I don't have a moral compass left. Like I said… I did it because I could. Because I am very capable. Because it was fun. And 'cause you're both fucking useless. Whoa, whoa. We're not that fucking useless, Johnny. We figured it out it was you. Mm genius. Yeah, I fucking am. Now where is it? - Johnny, where is it? - It's in the back. Ned? Done it this time, didn't you Johnny? Hm? We good? Ned, we good?! No, we're not fucking good. It's not here! You fucking dog cunt! Come on then! Oh shit! - Go! Sniper on the hill! - What? Sniper. Fuck! Fuck! Please. Please. You can go home, Corporal. I'll complete here. You did good, son. You're a soldier. You did what you had to do, you mopped up. Just go home, mate. Hey. It's not safe anymore. It's time to go. We have to move away from here. I won't do anything like that again, I promise. It's not that. I'm sorry. I won't run away ever again. I just want to stay here. These boys, they're not your friends. Dad, they're the only friends I've had. I'm sorry, Billy. - Yeah, you're sorry? - Yeah. No, you're not. You think this is my fault don't you? Yeah, yeah, my fault you left the Army, my fault you can't hold down a fucking job! You had to leave the Army to look after me! Who else was gonna take care of me? Mum was gone! Please don't… And that's my fault, too. And you wish she was still here and not me! You want to know why I run away? Because you don't fucking want me, Dad! Don't say that! Don't you say that! I'm sorry. Get out! Get out of my fucking room, Dad! Her brain? We can't possibly tell the outcome of her injuries. My boy? His head is fine. But he's bleeding internally. Mr Logan? You need to make a decision. Fuck! Turn the car off. What the fuck do you think you're doing? Turn off the car. In the glove box… It's all there. Don't think this is a tab that keeps on running. It stops now. You have a son. Just think what you would do for him. Don't test me. Jesus fucking Christ. We've reviewed the CCTV footage from a traffic lights and run diagnostics at the scene. The other driver, he crossed through an intersection on a red light and the impact was at high speed. The driver, we tested his blood alcohol level. He was over the limit. I'm sorry. Fuck!
