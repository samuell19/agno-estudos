[gong] [orchestral music] Hello, Johnny. What're you up to? I'm trying to get this down to the kitchen. [postman] Oh. Half a mo'. [telephone rings] Hello? Hello? -You've missed your ferry. -I know. How long have the tadpoles been in the bath? -Oh, there's a letter from Ardwick House. -Well? "No further cases of scarlet fever reported, school will reassemble for the last three weeks next Friday." -Nothing about any remission of fees? -No, but can't you claim the insurance? That's where they're cunning. We aren't covered if he's in quarantine. Don't sound like you want him to have it. [telephone rings] Hello? -Hello? -Oh, it keeps doing that. They must be testing the line. [telephone rings] -Shut up. -[dog growls] And you. I found this in the loo. What's the idea of entering up our washing in Morse code? It's the laundry book I lost. Johnny must have taken it. Oh yes. "John David Brent. Friday, 1950." Oh, he is naughty. I told the laundry they must have lost it. "Secret language of tramps." What's this about? "Mrs. Beale, 48; Miss Denton, 29; Daddy, 36." He had a burst of curiosity the other day about people's ages. I didn't dream he was writing it all down. Oh, do get on! I find that rather interesting, the subconscious desire to cling to one's youth motivating the ego at the age of ten. "Mrs. Brooks, 28"? That's rich! Isabelle Brooks? I shouldn't have said she was any more. Thirty-five if she's a day, dear. I've forgotten your egg. I don't believe it. He's got it from Terry, and she'd hardly lie about her age to her son. And you call yourself a psychologist. How you ever manage to make a living! [hits window] [dog growls] Hello there. What's the hurry? -Given up saying good morning to me? -Sorry. Good morning, daddy. -Don't eat too fast. -I'm not eating. Shut that window. You're sending a draft down my neck. I can't quite shut it or it'll cut off the current. What's the idea? I've got a bell running down to the kitchen so, when you're ready for your egg, you press this button. -Well, I'm ready now. -I'm not. Half a sec. Wouldn't it be easier if I just gave mommy a shout? Well, anyone can do that. Nearly ready. Right, now push it. Something's shorting. I know. It must be this terminal. I lost the proper nut so I borrowed one off the gramophone. I'll put it back. I know where it goes. -Mind you do. -[Johnny pants] Must you puff like that all over the toast? Nearly done. Right, now try again. [bell rings] And here comes my egg. Miraculous. -Oh, mommy, you've gone and spoiled it. -Have I? Get that mess away before Mrs. Beale arrives, or she'll be giving me notice. -You can see that it works, though. -Hmm, certainly does. Do you know, when a dog's near a ringing bell, it makes him thirsty? Where did you get that from? I don't know. I just know. Oh, Johnny dear, you never see your father sitting like that. If you want something to do, get my shoes. The black ones. Here, take these. Any idea what time you'll be home? Won't be before seven. I've got a hospital board meeting at five. Will you want any more tea? -Bound to, if you take the pot away. -These them? Those are they. I wish I knew what I was paying £70 a term for. -Any new ships in? -I don't know. Let's see. Yes, here we are. Empress of France. Due in today. [Ursula] You'll miss another ferry if you keep dawdling. She's a Canadian Pacific. Can I come and see her? Only if you're ready now. I'm starting when I finish my egg. Ow! Oh, it's my sting winkle. You've broken it. It's your own fault. Your father's shoes are not for sting winkles. Now then. Throw it away. Put your jacket on. You can go down to the beach and find another. Go on, off with you. [energetic music] -Daddy, can a fish be seasick? -I've no idea. I shouldn't think so. Terry Smith said he ruffled the goldfish pool water and one of them was sick. I said I didn't believe him… Daddy, look! Tramp! -Have you got a bit of chalk on you? -I'm afraid not. Look, I can't wait. It's all right. I just found some. [carefree music] -Secret language of tramps? -Yes. How did you guess? What sign did you put on our gate? -[laughs] -Bad people: keep away. [both laugh] -[ferry horn] -There she is. The Empress of France. Daddy, can't I come with you and see her properly? No, it wouldn't be fair. Don't want to give another boy scarlet fever. Come along, sir. -So long. -So long. Try and keep away from other kids. If you have to go near them, put a hankie in front of your face. Blimey, he's not that ugly! [upbeat music] Hello, nice dog. I'm afraid I haven't anything for you. No, nothing. What are you doing in my garden? I was just getting a bit of bread for that dog. You've no right to steal bread. I put crusts there for the birds. You're trespassing. Go away at once. What are you doing now? What's that? -It's a secret language. -I'll have no secrets. Chalking on my gate post. What does it mean? It means the lady here is kind and generous. [sniffles] And that made the big bear laugh, and then I laughed, and he laughed and I laughed and… and then I think I woke up. That was a funny dream, wasn't it? All right, Sally. Pop back to the waiting room and see if you can find a comic I hid for you. She's been much better this week. Just one little accident on Monday, but apart from that-- Yes, we're getting along fine. Mrs. Mercer, I'd like your husband to come have a word with me. Husband? I don't think he could tell you anything. I'd like to see him all the same. This recurrent dream of hers, about the big bear. It's clear to me that Sally's utilizing that bear as a symbol of her father. Really? It may sound odd to you, but it is an established fact that, when a child experiences a peculiar fascination for some kind of animal, it's nearly always identifying that animal, sub-consciously, of course, with their own father. [seagulls cry] [ferry horn] Morning, Mr. Pickering. Hello, Johnny. What are you doing that for? Tell me something else to do and I'll do it. You've missed a bit there. Ta. Need a pair of spectacles, I do. You'd be able to see better if you bored little holes in your ears and stuck golden earrings in 'em. Fancy you knowing that, now. It's what they did in the olden days. I read about it. Education's a wonderful thing. I wish I had more time for reading. In the olden days, when they wanted to make a man confess, they'd wait until the tide was going out, then they'd cut open his stomach and tie a piece of cork to his insides. -Trip on the boat, lady? -No, thank you. Come along, dear. What are you trying to do? Ruin me? Go on, push off. Go on. Push off, now. [inquisitive music] I've got a magnet. Yes, and it's a jolly good one, too. Let me have a go. Where did you get it? Here? Want to swap it? I'll give you this golf ball for it. It's got two miles of elastic. Stretch it all out and you'll have five miles of elastic. I'll give you the golf ball and this potato. It's a very rare one. All right, swap for this. It's got a range of 25 yards. See your nanny over there? You could hit her from here with this. Come on, swap! Torch. I'll give you the pistol and all these. [music swells] Will you swap it for my invisible watch? Show me. I can't see anything. That proves it really is invisible. -Nan, nan, look what I've got! -If you're bringing me another crab… -No, it's a watch. Look! -Well, I can't see anything. -It's an invisible watch. -Let me hear it, then. It's stopped! [cheerful music] -Boy, you give that back. -He swapped it. -I'll give you swap. Hand it over at once. -I gave him my invisible watch. You stop telling fibs. He's got nothing of yours. Well, he's dropped it, then. I'm coming to the end of my patience. Hand it over. Stop, thief! I'll have the police after you. You're a thief, that's what you are. Just a little swindler! Stop! Stop! [lively music] [slow music] -Look out! -[car horn] [brakes screech] They'll be measuring you for a wooden overcoat. [music swells] [slow music] [upbeat music] [snores] Here, sonny. You don't want to lose this. [clatter] Here, let's have a loan of this. You've got something here, chum. Come on, I'll show you. Got a penny? Don't matter, I have. Split the fags, see. Fifty-fifty. Three for me and two for you. He's not looking, is he? Now, watch this. In you go, my beauty. [machine dings] Up a bit. [machine dings] See? Easy. [machine dings] That's it. [machine dings] Keeping an eye out, aren't you? Back to the five. Now back to the three. [machine dings] -And that'll do for the first. -Come 'ere! Fiddle it, would you? Give that here. -I'll have you locked up for this. -It's his. Yours, is it? No, you don't. Do you know what this makes you? A juvenile delinquent. Do you know what they do to juvenile delinquents? They send them to Borstal. Come on, we'll find a copper. [clinks] -What's the big idea? -I'm sorry, missus. Caught you proper. Where's that policeman? I've a good mind to give you in charge. Here, get out of it! What are you up to, son? Look! Is he dead? Well, what's to do, my friend? Habeas corpus? Imminent collapse of building? Or is the place on fire? This young man thinks you've got a corpse down there. [man] So I have, indeed. Murder is a fine art. It's my great passion. Better take him to the station, hadn't we? [man] Shame on you, teasing the boy like that. Come on, lad. Come and meet my corpse. Go on, son. I'll look after you. Here he is. A fugitive from the Waxworks. Used to be Queen Elizabeth before they turned him into Danny Kaye. I knew he wasn't dead really. Oh, he nearly met a fate worse than death. When I rescued him last week, he was about to become Sir Stafford Cripps. [chuckles] Oh, I get it. It's meant to be an iron lung. Correct. The hospital asked me to make it for demonstration purposes. That's Corporation English for "publicity stunt." What's this for? They put sick people in when they can't breathe properly. It does the breathing for them. See? Can I work it? Of course you can, and you may. -How much is the real one going to cost? -[man] Oh, about £450. Can't you get one free from the National Health? -He'll go far, this lad will! -[chuckles] No, son. St Valentine's is a disclaimed hospital. It doesn't come under the Scheme. Well, I wish you luck. Here, put that towards it. [man] No, I didn't invite you down here to relieve-- That's all right. I'll come round later with Police Ball tickets. -Good morning. -Good morning. I'm afraid I haven't got any money. Don't you worry about that, son. It's quite the fashion these days. [chuckles] Would this be any good? Oh, you don't want to part with that. I do. Now, look, my friend. You may regret this generous impulse later. I won't, honestly. It's worth quite a lot. The little ones are nine-pence, and this is the best one ever. Yes. Yes, I'm sure it is. Thank you, son. Thank you very much. Never before in my experience… [orchestral music] [light-hearted music] -Car's here. -Right. Goodbye, darling. Goodbye, mommy. -Got your cap? -In my pocket. It'll get crumpled in there. Why not put it on? Not until I have to. Take care of yourself. -Mommy, the taxi driver's watching! -All right, darling. That's the last, I promise. Goodbye, Danny. Goodbye, old man. Be a good dog while I'm away. -Come on. We shall miss that train. -Coming! Wait! Cap! There. -You've got your ration book? -Yes, mommy. -Goodbye, mommy. -Goodbye, my darling. -See you later. -Goodbye. [applause] [jazz music] -Good evening, Doctor. -Good evening, Harper. Nice looking job. Yes, even a mechanical age has its craftsmen. Good of your friend to turn up. [announcer] Number 14, Miss Gwen Mumford of Birkenhead. [jazz music starts] Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. Sorry about this. George was at the office. I stopped for a drink. How unfortunate! -Have I missed much? -Only them. [Ursula] But they aren't what you came for, are they? Hardly. Did Johnny go off all right? Oh, fine. Ran into a pal of his at the station. Which one? That boy whose beard caught on fire at the Christmas play. -Butterworth? Oh, he's no pal of Johnny's. -They seemed quite friendly. -Punched each other in the stomach. -Really? I'd understood that Butterworth was an object of derision because he can't belch. [announcer] Last but not least, number 16, Miss Marion Forbes of New Brighton. Oh, by the way… [Ursula] You started to say something. [Brent] Oh yes, erm… -I was just going to say… -Well, get on with it. Don't keep on interrupting. You'll only make me forget. You'd better get our ration books next time. What are you talking about? She works at the Food Office. [applause] And now, ladies and gentlemen, while the judges are making their decision, I want you to give your attention to Mr. Adam Harper of the Board of St Valentine's Hospital. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen. This here is a demonstration model of the iron lung, which, by your presence here this evening, you're helping to provide for the local hospital. This drum here, on being set in motion, by the turn of a switch… [scattered laughs] This'll be the evening's success. Don't! I suffer terribly on these occasions. [scattered groans] [man in sea] Bring those mermaids round again! -[laughter] -All right. All right. Never mind. Never mind. This gives me a chance to tell a story. The story of the little chap who came into my workshop the other day. A story that'll make all of you proud to be his fellow citizens. -He's good, old Adam. -Is he making it all up? He wanted to know what this apparatus was for. Well, I told him as simply as I could. And then… Then something very, very wonderful happened. I can see the look on his little face now. I wish I had a penny to help the poor sick people. Never mind, sonny. Perhaps one day when you grow up. Will this be any help to the poor sick people? Indeed it will. But surely, isn't it something you treasure? Yes, it is. But please take it for the poor sick people. They need it more than I do. [Harper] So I took it, and here it is: a simple offering of a little unknown lad, who gave up for this cause, the most precious thing that he possessed. -[applause] -Wonderful story. Made my eyeblack run. I've got an idea. -Auction it for the hospital! -An excellent idea! Who'll make me an offer for this magnet? Proceeds to help the fund. You'll start me off, sir? Five pounds? [Harper] Five pounds, I'm bid. -Cunning devil. -You asked for it. Ten pounds. [Harper] Thank you, sir! Ten pounds, I'm bid. -Fifteen! -Erm, 20! Twenty pounds from Mr. Jervis. -Where's the rival grocer? -[laughs] [Harper] Now, what about it, Mr. Fogg? -Twenty-five. -Twenty-seven ten. Thirty. -[Harper] Any advance on 30? -Thirty-five. Can't let those fellows get away with it. Silly old ass. Why won't he let 'em battle a bit longer? Are you all finished at 35? -Thirty-six. -Darling, we can't afford it. The Mayor will buy it. His firm wants to build a real iron lung. -Going… -Thirty-seven. See? -Thirty-eight. -[Harper] Thirty-eight, I'm bid. -[Harper] You again, Mr. Mayor? -[Mayor coughs] [Harper] Going at £38. [Harper] Going… Going… Forty. [Harper] Thank you, sir. [Harper] No more bids? Right! Sold to our popular Mayor, Mr. James Hancock. [applause] Don't you ever give me a minute like that again. -It took three years off my life. -Still, it was a marvelous idea. -Forty pounds for a cheap magnet. -The boy takes the credit. I do hope his parents are here. They must be feeling terribly proud. This week's big attraction. Now, what would I do with a thing like that? Take it away. Auction it again. A magnet. A toy magnet. I can see him now, in his little ill-fitting clothes… Go on, sir. Take it. I reckon they need it more than me. Now, look here, son. Are you sure you won't miss it too much? That's all right, sir. I don't mind so long as it's to help the poor sick people. He gave his all. What about you? There he stood, holding it out to me, his poor little thin arm showing through his ragged shirt. This any good to 'em, guv'nor? I ain't got nothing else. It'd be very useful, sonny, but I couldn't possibly-- Go on, guv'nor. Take it. I want you to. Let the poor sick perishers have it. [Harper] But he gave it willingly… cheerfully… -[sealion cries and claps] -[applause] One hundred pounds, I'm bid. Do I hear 110? -Thank you, madam. -[light applause] We only need, erm, 12 more now. Will somebody complete the amount? Sold, to the Chairman of the Board of St Valentine's Hospital, His Worship the Mayor, for 122 pounds, which now gives us the total sum required. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, I have no intention of keeping this magnet for myself. [scattered laughs] As soon as we know which firm is to receive our new iron lung… [coughs] [whispers] As if we couldn't guess. -Ssh! -Excuse me. As soon as we know that, I shall hand over this magnet to be suitably mounted on the apparatus, as an ever present reminder of that fine little lad, whose unselfishness and high sense of public duty has set an example to us all. Hear, hear! His identity remains unknown to us, but I have given orders that the search for him is to continue, for I feel it's up to us to see that this poor little waif, so long as he breathes in our midst, shall never go hungry again. Here, Brent, try one of these. -What are they? -Marzipan wizards. -Do they go with potato crisps? -Of course, you ass. Thanks. -P and O! -Rot, she's an Ellerman. She's the Clan Line, bet you! White band round the funnel. Hey, Nosnibor! Polish flag! -Where? -Beyond that Ellerman. -P and O. -Clan Line. -[boy] Help, Nosnibor! Rescue! -I'm coming! Is your friend a Pole? Pole? No, sir. Nosnibor sounds like a Polish name. His real name's Robinson, only we spell it backwards. Oh, I see. Stupid of me. -Where's this? -Canada dock. That's us. Come on, Scatty. -Bye, all. -[boys say goodbye] Goodbye! [ominous music] Yes, ever so sad. Proper heart-breaking. Poor little mite. -Sir, may I borrow your paper? -Yes, certainly. -Pneumonia, was it? -They said it was pneumonia. But I know better. If you ask me, his poor little heart was broken. Makes you feel you want to cry, doesn't it? I cried my eyes out, I don't mind admitting it. To see him lying there, all stiff and dead. Here's a picture of him taken just before he went. Dear little chap. He wasn't mine, but I did get that fond of him. I cried enough to fill a bucket. What are your views about DeBeer's? Likely to improve? Hello, are you feeling all right? [nanny] And I'll tell you something about that… Perhaps we'd better have the window open. It's all right. I'm getting out here, thank you. All right, old boy. Hello, old man. How are you? Fine. You're looking pale. Nothing to do with your report, I hope. No, no, everything's all right, thank you. There goes our new car. -Daddy? -Yes, old man? If a person's in quarantine for scarlet fever, and he goes up to another boy and talks to him, can he give him pneumonia? No, quite impossible. Why? Nothing. I just wondered. Daddy, can a person really die of a broken heart? Heavens, you haven't broken yours, have you? Can they, daddy? [Brent] It'd be a poor lookout for poets if they didn't. What was that last word? "Billet." B-I-L-L-E-T. Is this good French? Good enough. Now let's have it in German. Oh, dear. Let me see. [in German] The reward… [in English] Don't write this down. [in German] The reward will be paid upon return. [in German] Good morning. -[Johnny laughs] -[in English] Nearly ready. Johnny, stand up and let daddy see. It's not so extraordinary. -[Brent] I say! -[Ursula] I can't believe that's my son. They suit him. -How do they feel, Johnny? -All right. It's quite an occasion, this. Look, I, erm, meant to slip something in the pocket. I forgot. -There you are. -Thanks awfully. What's all this about? I've got a parachute to send up my kite string. It comes off at the top and goes for miles and miles. "Reward paid if returned to J.D Brent." I put it in English too so if it blew across to Ireland, they'd understand it. Empty this, will you? You don't know any Norwegian, do you, daddy? No, I'm afraid not. -I may be able to work it out in Arabic. -I don't think it'll get as far as Arabia. What's this reward you're offering? I thought perhaps a tuppenny stamp. Foreigners would like that, wouldn't they? Because an English one is foreign to them. Here, take this and get on. You'll be late. [applause] It only remains for me to add that, if at some future time our little benefactor is traced, he will find awaiting him this mark of our esteem, this honor, which it has long been the custom of our ancient borough to bestow upon its most illustrious sons and daughters: the Civic Gold Medal! [applause] [dream-like music] Extraordinary how they can't trace that boy with the magnet. They'll find him eventually, you can be sure of that. [tense music] [Ursula] Who's that? -Oh, it's you. You're back early. -Where's your kite? Blown away? What a shame! You're all out of breath. You been chasing it? That's always the way with kites. I had one, once-- -[knock on door] -It's all right, I'll go. [man] Does J.D Brent live here? [Ursula] J.D? -Oh yes, it's my son. -[man] I found this in Woodchurch Road. I see. -I think that ought to cover it. -Ta. Thank you very much. Where are you, Johnny? A man's just brought your parachute back. It didn't quite get as far as France or Germany. It came down in Woodchurch Road. But you can use it again. No kite. I think perhaps the housekeeping can run to it. Like to buy yourself another? Erm, thanks mommy, but I don't think I will just at the moment. What? I've got a bit of a pain. It's all that chasing about, I expect. Why not go and lie down for a little while? I think perhaps I will. Read a book and take it easy. You can have supper in bed, if you like. Thanks, I'll see. [nanny] If you ask me, his poor little heart was broken. I cried my eyes out. I don't mind admitting it. To see him lying there all stiff and dead. -Hello, there. -Hello. -How's the pain? -Better, thanks. -Do you think you can manage this? -I'll try. It was hard luck about the kite. It doesn't matter, really. Saved me winding the string in. [laughing] There is that about it. Now, Johnny, really! Your new trousers. It's high time you learned a little tidiness. If you're old enough to wear these, you can look after your clothes. [Johnny] Sorry, daddy. Do make an effort, old man. -Have you got everything you want? -Yes, thanks. If not, give us a shout. A little off color. Nothing to worry about. Should I take his temperature? No, a good night's sleep and he'll be full of beans again. Let me go! I didn't mean to kill him! Let me go! [dramatic music] No, no! I don't want the beastly magnet! Take it away! It's all right, my darling. It's just a silly old dream. That's a boy. Ooh! There! Let mommy tuck you up, hmm? Night, night. -All right? -Yes, just a nightmare. I was trying to remember what I gave him for lunch. For a psychiatrist's wife, you have an amazing regard for the influence of the digestive organs. You don't think it's anything else? It might be. I can't say without a bit more material evidence. Look, I'd like you to keep a close watch on him tomorrow. Make a note of everything he says and does. All right. Goodnight, darling. Goodnight. Don't worry. [slow intriguing music] [sewing machine whirs] Hello. -Wearing his shorts again. -I thought it might mean something. Yes, I'm pretty sure it does. -Hasn't been out of the house? -Only as far as the shed. Here's his laundry book. He left it on the window sill. Good, this may help a lot. -I wonder what… -Another of his famous lists. No ages or numbers. What's the common factor this time? Mrs. Tucker, Mrs. Wentworth Jones, Mrs… Porridge, it looks like. [laughs] Mrs. Torridge. She's the woman who works in the dairy. What can Deidre Wentworth Jones have in common with her? They spit in your face when they talk, but-- Wait a minute. Does this dairywoman ride a bicycle? Well, she used to before she… -Oh! -That may be it. I've often seen Deirdre on a bike. -Robert. -Mrs. Tucker, too. -And Mrs. Flint. This is most interesting. -Robert, do listen. I wonder if I can explain the implications of this. -All these women ride bicycles. -Well, they don't now. What? They're all having babies. [gentle music] -Hello. -Hello, daddy. I can write nearly as fast with my foot as I can with my hand. It'll be useful next time you get 100 lines. Yes, it will, won't it? I can write with my left foot, too. You watch. You say a word and I'll see if I can write it down. Yes, all right. No, wait a minute. That's a bit too simple. Tell you what. You shut your eyes and I'll say a word. Write down the first thing that comes into your head. That's a good idea. All right. Shut your eyes and make your mind blank. [Johnny] Ready. Trousers. [intriguing music] [tense music] My toes are tired. That's a word though, isn't it? Ma? Certainly. Short for mother. And it means "my" in French. That's right. So it does. I bet you're the first person to write two languages simultaneously with your foot. -Gosh, do you really think I am? -Hmm, positive. Now, look. It's time you packed up. Come on, hop in. Shall I write to the newspapers and tell them? Hmm, you should. Get your picture on the front page. I don't think perhaps I will. -Goodnight, old man. -Goodnight, daddy. Well? Yes, I know exactly what's wrong. Everything's as clear as daylight. Oh blast! It's that fuse again. Here we are. -Haven't we got a torch? -Johnny borrowed the battery for his bell. Tell me about Johnny. I had a pretty shrewd idea what the trouble was. Now I know I'm right. He's just supplied the final proof. -You know where the main switch is? -Yes, yes. Go on. Johnny's in the throes of a mental conflict, precipitated by his new trousers. All right, switch off the main. [Brent] His first pair of long trousers, tangible evidence that he's growing up. Now, the knowledge that the thing is inevitable tends to make it frightening. I never can remember these circuits. [Brent] Therefore, he has a latent dread of the future, which gives him a desire to cling to the past. Ah. Now, the past is something which he associates with the motherly protection he's always known. You follow me? Erm, yes dear. At a respectful distance. He goes out in his long trousers for the first time, and, by a very unfortunate chance, he lets go the string of his kite, and loses a cherished possession. Now, in his subconscious, that symbolized the final severing of the cord binding him to his mother. Oh, Robert. [Brent] Do you want to understand what's happening? Yes, but connecting me with a kite… Go on. He goes back into his shorts. He stays near you all day to demonstrate his dependence on you. He becomes preoccupied with unborn babies. -Do try to keep that still. -Robert, it's frightening. Are you sure about this? Darling, just now I tried a potted version of Jung's Associative Word Test. I made him shut his eyes and write down the first thing that came to him when I said "trousers." -There we are. -And what happened? He wrote… Ma. -Ma? -Yes. -Diminutive of the word "mother." -Oh, Robert. What am I to do? You've got to make him feel there's a new bond growing between you two. A bond just as strong as the old one, with the difference that, you are now the weaker partner, growing more and more dependent on him. Give him little jobs that only he can do for you. Get him to unscrew the top of a jar because you aren't strong enough. Or… Put it on again. The top of a jar? -[Brent] The switch! -Oh. You know the sort of thing. Make a point of remarking now and again that you… don't know what you'd do without him, and so on. Oh, Robert. Isn't life cruel? Think what thousands of children suffer, going through an ordeal like this with parents who don't realize the trouble. Yes, darling. Whatever small success I may have had in my profession, I've never been so thankful for my training as I am at this moment. Yes, daddy. I did take his magnet. It broke his heart. They're after me, daddy. They'll lock me up! Mommy! Oh, you are here. I'm seeing if I can get around without touching the floor. Yes, darling. I'm going to the shops and I wondered if you'd come and help me carry things. Oh, must I? Well, you don't want to stay here alone, do you? I don't mind! I want to see if I can get around the room like this. But you may fall, and there won't be anyone here to help you. All right. I'll do a bit of Meccano until you get back. Oh, come on, old boy. It's lovely out and I don't think I can manage all those things alone. Let me stay, mommy. Please let me. Well, if it means so much to you. Thanks awfully, mommy. Ow! -[Johnny] What's the matter? -Oh, I hurt myself.. Oh, turned my ankle. Run to the bathroom, hold my flannel under the cold tap, squeeze it and bring it here. Right! -[Johnny] What's this do? -It takes the swelling out. [Johnny] When a native breaks his leg in Africa, the witch doctor rubs it with a juice from squished beetles. Well, I haven't broken my leg. I just thought it'd be fun to try if I could find enough beetles to squish. Well, I prefer this, thanks. Does it hurt much? It feels better already. What would I do without you, Johnny? You have to do without me when I'm at school. Erm, yes, but I mean this afternoon. Darling, I have to have those things for this evening and I can't walk to the shops now. I'll go and ring up a taxi. Johnny, really! When I've got you to rely on? But you said I needn't go out. But that was before this happened. Now, help me up. There's a good boy. Oh! I'll give you a list of the things I want, and it won't take you longer than about ten minutes. I'm a lucky woman having such a useful son. Get me something to write with, darling. Now, let me see. First the grocer. I want, erm… custard powder… tin of tomato soup… Erm… yes, a pound of macaroni. At the greengrocers, I want a large lettuce. A nice hard one. [Ursula] And you might ask if the frozen peas are in. If not, get a tin of French beans. But don't mention those until you've asked about the peas. -Johnny, are you listening? -Sorry, what? Do put that thing down and pay attention for a moment. Don't bother about the beans unless they say they haven't any frozen peas. -Have you got that? -Hmm! I think that's all for today. The rest can wait until tomorrow. -You'd better take my basket. -Oh, must I? You can ask Mr. Johnson to sell you one of his carrier bags. You needn't pay. Have them put down. Run along, darling. Oh, cheer up! You ought to feel proud doing all this important work for me. [orchestral music] [tense music] Half a guinea a ticket? That's blackmail! We've applied for an extension. If you get one, I shan't dance. If you don't, I shan't come. It's that boy! The boy with the magnet! Hey, sonny! Sonny! -I'll head him off. -Here, just a minute, sonny! We want you! [tense music] There he is! We've got him cornered! [engine starts] [dramatic music] There I was, dancing in a cabaret with a monstrous man in a black sombrero. He twirled me round and round, and suddenly, I found it was Mr. Faraday, our vicar. And I don't know if you know Mr. Faraday, but the most significant fact-- Excuse me, sir. Mrs. Brent is on the telephone. It's very urgent. All right, switch it through. Please excuse me, Mrs. Ward. Something rather urgent. Hello? Darling, what is it? I just sent him out for one or two things, but that was over an hour ago, and you said he wouldn't want to leave me. I'm sure he wouldn't stay away of his own accord. Darling, try not to worry. I'll start making enquiries at once. -[warehouseman] Hey, George. -Hello? -Coming for a cup of tea? -What time is it? -Half past four. -Yes. I could do with one. [train passes] [children shout] [children] Out! He ain't playing. If he caught it, he was playing. If he wasn't, he wouldn't have caught it. -Give us that ball. -Come on, get on with it. Hey, I'm in. Give us that bat. -It's my turn. -It's my bat. Well, if I'm out, I'm taking my stumps home. Call yourself a cricketer? Get out of the way. Out of the way, I said. -Come here. Where you going? -Nowhere special. -What's your name? -Johnny Brent. [mocking] Oh me name's Johnny Brent! Me name's Johnny Brent! -Ha! Your shirt's hanging out. -Where are you from? -Over the river. -Over the "rivah"? What are you doing here? -I ran away. -[all talking] Ran away from home? I'll make him talk. The police are after me. Don't believe it. You're a liar. -I'm not. It's true. -What do they want you for? Copper, lads. Hey, you, come here! We wasn't doing nothing. Have you seen a strange boy here this afternoon? Ten years old, gray pullover and shorts, blue and yellow tie… -What's his name? -[officer] John Brent. Have you seen him? Not me. All right. What's he done, mister? Don't make him nosey. Let's have a chase. Okay, you can come out now. He's gone. What do they want you for, lad? -Murder. -Murder? Well, sort of, anyway. -He's a murderer. -Murderer? Yeah. Done in a copper. Slit his throat. Well, don't all stand here nattering. We've got to find a place for him to hide. Right, eh? Do you know somewhere, then? I know! There's that bombed house in Bangkok Street. No, he wants to keep out of them. -That's how my brother got pinched. -If I was on the run, I know what I'd do. Jump a train and go to Birmingham. Why do you want to go to Birmingham? It's a long way from here. -So's Australia. -[boys laugh] Shut up! I'm thinking. Cor, I bet it don't half hurt. -I know where. -Shut up, I said. If it's an idea, we'd best hear it. I've got it. -Down the pier. The old diver's hut. -That's just what I was going to say. -You're a liar. -Thought of it long ago. -You're all liars. -You're wasting time. That's right. Come, I'll show you the way. [carefree music] Assault! Assault! [woman speaking Chinese] My mom says I've got to have my tea. Come on, then. No, Mrs. Brent. He hasn't been down his way. I haven't seen Johnny all day. Thank you. I just wondered. Oh, I say. Have you seen a small boy, about-- I'm a police officer. I'm looking for him myself. Thank you. I just wondered. -Dr. Brent! I've just seen him. -You have? Where? In this very street. Recognized him as soon as I saw him. -It's the boy with the magnet, right! -Blast the boy with the magnet! [tense music] Come on. Hurry up! -Not bad, eh? -Jolly good. Mike, Perce, get that suit down. Give you something to lie on. Got some food there? Yes. Well, I think so. I'll scrounge grub and bring it round in the morning. We'll all scrounge some. Got it? If you want to take a walk, you want to put this on. Disguise. Oh, turn it up. We're making too much noise. Yeah. Come on. -Are you going now? -Yeah, got to. See you in the morning. Come here. Goodnight. [all] Goodnight. Goodnight. [gentle music] [man] Extraordinary how they can't trace that boy with the magnet. [woman] They'll find him eventually. You can be sure of that. [tense music] [telephone rings] Mrs. Brent speaking. Yes? I see. Thank you. No news. [hesitantly] He'll turn up soon. I assure you, it's simply a case of the super-ego motivated-- Oh, kite strings! [window opens] Come in. Who's there? It's us. -Sleep all right? -Oh, I'm stiff. -Hungry? -Oh, thank you. I've got some, too. -Thank you very much. -Somebody's coming. It's only Mike. -Anybody else about? -No, come on. What are we going to do? What do you mean do? We can't play cricket here. We'd lose the ball if we had one. What do you want to do? [Johnny] That old barge looks fun. -Come on, let's break it up. -We won't have long. The tide's coming in. Hey! What's the big idea? -Who let him out? -He wanted to come out. I told you to wait for me. -Where are you going? -Smash that old barge up. -Who said so? -Johnny did. -I didn't say so. -Johnny said so. [scoffs] I've had the cops after me afore now, hundreds of times. What's that got to do with the barge? -You shut up. -Why should I shut up for you? See that hole there? -[Johnny] What about it? -I dare you to walk across. -I dare you. -You do? Come on, then. -Bet you've done it before. -I never have. -Yes, you have. I've seen you. -You're a liar. Come on! [Spike] What's the matter? Get a move on! [boys jeer] Windy. Get up. Windy. He's all of a tremble. It's easy, I tell you. I can do it backwards. -Don't be an ass. -I've done it hundreds of times. -[Perce] You never have. -You're a liar. [Johnny] No, don't! Don't! Don't! [Johnny gasps] [tense music] [Perce] He's dead! Stop! Stop! Wait! Get some help, quick! -They'll catch you. -Get some help! [dramatic music] [woman chats] [siren rings] What's the matter, fireman? Practicing? -Have a cherry. They're awfully nice. -No, thank you, nurse. -Hello, darling. -Hello, mommy. -How are you feeling? -All right. -Daddy, don't let them take my picture. -Do what? I mentioned there was a press photographer downstairs wanting his picture. -He doesn't like the idea. -No. That's all right, Johnny. Don't you worry. Nurse, go and send him away. -Yes, doctor. -Thank you. -How's Spike? -He's doing well. -What did you find? -Spinal cord compression in the neck. There's temporary paralysis of the breathing mechanism. [chuckles] We got that iron lung just in time! He's not going to die, is he? [laughs] No. No, of course not. He'll be out again in a fortnight. Here's a visitor, Spike. -Hello. -Hello. Bet you've never seen anything like this before. I have. -Bet you haven't. -Yes, I have. You're a liar. -[Spike] What's the matter? -[Johnny] That… thing. -What, that old magnet? -What's it doing there? I don't know. The nurse started telling me some yarn. Load of tripe. I'll have it off before I go. Your mother's come to take you home. Say goodbye, Spike. Goodbye. Goodbye. -Good afternoon, nurse. -Good afternoon. -The committee meeting started? -They've just gone in. Thank you. No… Yes! Got you, my lad. This time you don't escape from me! Mr. Harper, that's a patient! Gentlemen. Gentlemen, I have him at last! The boy with the magnet. Johnny! Daddy, I didn't mean to do it. I didn't think. -But, Dr. Brent, this can't be your son. -Certainly it's my son. [laughs] This is the boy we've been looking for. It can't be. You're not the boy who gave Mr. Harper a magnet? Yes, daddy, but I didn't think I was doing wrong. Not at the time. Wrong? Wrong? [coughs] You've done nothing wrong, lad. Don't you know why we've been looking for you? Why, so I can present you with this. Please, sir. I… don't think I want it. [all disagree] [applause] [soft music] [nanny] Kit! Can't you hear me? Do as I tell you! Come away from that dirty thing! [nanny] Come away, I tell you! Kit! Come away at once! -What's that? -Civic Gold Medal. -Want to swap it? -What for? I'll give you my invisible watch. You will? Show me. Listen. Tick, tick, tick! Okay. [upbeat music] Nan! Nan, look what I've got! Oh! [upbeat music]
