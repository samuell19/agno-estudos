So if you'll come with me-- (alarmed grunting) All right, Luis, we're going to do this nice and easy. (muffled rumbling and banging) (crashing) (shouting) (thumping) (unintelligible shouting) (uptempo music) (horn honking) (uptempo music) (tires screeching) - What's going on with my mind, man? I feel so sleepy. (punching) - Hey, ma. I got him. Yeah, knockout drops in the beer. Hey, come pick me up, and bring some baby wipes. Lots of baby wipes. (sighing) (guitar music) (dial rattling) (creaking) (snoring) (tense music) (rattling) (growling) (shushing) (crackling) (fire roaring) (screaming) (grunting) (meowing) (phone ringing) Ma! The phone, get it! Ah, for the love of Pete. Rosse Bonds, Rod here. Yeah, who's this? - My name is Miss Candy, and I'm calling on behalf of Senator Deathface. Mr. Rosse, you did some work for us a few years back, the Milsap case. - Yeah, I remember; what's up? - Well, we got a new problem. It's very time-sensitive. We need somebody located, and we need them located fast. - Sounds expensive, lady. - Our pockets are deep enough, Mr. Rosse. Be at the senator's office today at two. And come alone. Keep this on the down-low. - My whole life is on the down-low, lady. (clicking) Hello, hello? (dial tone) Eh. Ma, ma, we got another job! I need you to look something up for me. - What's that, Roddy, I can't here you son! I got the Taser gun to work, Roddy. Spring-loaded, wrist-release action! I adjusted the tension and watch. - Hey ma, what did you say? (sizzling crackles) (pained grunting) - [Ma Rosse] Well, it works half the time, Roddy. - [Rod] What you got, ma? - [Ma Rosse] All's I could find was the fire last night at the biker headquarters in the desert. - [Rod] Ah, is Deathface still using that biker gang for security? - [Ma Rosse] Yes, the Inland Emperors. Some real bad seeds there, Roddy. Be careful, son, stop licking yourself. - [Rod] What? - [Ma Rosse] Sorry, I was talking to Mr. Butterkisses. - Stop talking to the cat when you're on the phone with me. - Get down from there! - All right, ma, I'm almost there. I'll let you know the details as soon as I know something. - [Ma Rosse] Watch yourself, pussy! - I hope you're talking to the cat, ma. (honking) (somber music) - Welcome to my office. What a fine looking group you are. - You better stop staring at my titties! - Odell Braxton, the finest looking bounty hunter I ever did see. Ace of Spades; you're about as ugly as a badger in a storm drain. Jose Tanaka, the terror of Osaka. And last but not least, Rod Rosse, the one-man posse. You've all done work for me before. And each of you possesses a special gift. The gift of keeping your traps shut. I appreciate that. I demand that. - Senator, why all the secrecy? - This is one of those "keep your trap shut" moments, Rosse. Any of you ever keep a diary? Odell, you know what I'm talking about? Something you put your thoughts in, your innermost secrets? Well, I had something like that taken from me. You get that girl, and you get back what she stole from me. This is winner-take all. The clock is ticking, baby. Tick-tock, tick-tock. (dinging) - Winner takes all, Rosse. You wanna just give up now? - Shouldn't you be out flattening my tires, or calling the SWAT team on my office again? - Why, whatever do you mean? - I know how you play, Ace: dirty. Dirty like a day-old diaper. - Ah, is someone a sore loser? If you can't play with the big boys, Rosse, then get out of my sandbox. - You're a bearded little hemorrhoid. - I'm gonna ride you hard, like a hemorrhoid! - What does that even mean? - It means shut up! (dinging) - Excuse me. Hello? - Oh, hell yeah. - Give me 30 on number three. - What's the rush, baby? Wait, hold up, is that a tattoo? Oh, you know I be loving the honeys with the tats. - Give me 30 on number three and stop talking to me. - Chill, girl, I'm just trying to get to know you. You like house music, energy drinks? Oh, wait, wait, hold up, hold up, listen, listen. Oh, that's my jam; that's my jam! (rhythmic dance music) Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah! Check it out: I can do the moonwalk. But I can do it going forward, though. Oh, yeah! Uh, go ahead, Gary, uh, yeah! You feel that girl? Yeah, oh yeah-- (shouting) (thudding and smacking) - Jackass. (funk music) ♪ I'm about to blow my top! ♪ I'm about to go-- (tires screeching) (engine rumbling) ♪ One in the chamber, one more in the clip ♪ - [Rod] So, what'd you find, ma? - Her name's Lana Marie Oswald. 16 years old. Her parents were the founding members of the Inland Emperors. - [Rod] So this girl's mixed up with that biker gang then. - Oh, she's not mixed up, Roddy. She's biker royalty. Her parents were the founders of the Inland Emperors. Looks like they were killed in a police shootout, when she was a baby. - I think those bikers know more about this girl than they're letting on; I need to find out what they know. I got an idea, ma, but I'm gonna need to borrow the credit card for this one. - [Ma Rosse] Oh, Roddy, we just paid the card off! We can't be getting back in debt like that, Roddy. (overlapping arguments) (engine rumbling) (somber music) (dogs barking) - Adolf, Lucifer, shut the hell up, dogs! Who are you? - Somebody called for a plumber. - Oh, man, did Cosmo mess up the toilet again? Come in. - No worries, my good man. How you doing? Hi there, how's it going? (tense music) - What are you looking at? - Here it is. Have at it, man. (creaking) (gasping) - Ah, holy Moses! (unintelligible murmuring) - Deathface has made it clear that this cannot get out of control. Now, I know he hired some bounty hunter scumbags to find Lana, but we gotta find her first. Sandman, what you got? - Well, Big Mike said he saw a girl a couple weeks back looked just like Lana. She was up at Chaw's apartment, the Wayside, yeah. I don't know; what do you think? - Use your head. If you were a girl on the run, where would you be? - At my drug dealer boyfriend's house, right? - I never liked that little bastard, Chaw. (agreeable murmuring) - [Biker Leader] Deathface ain't gonna like this. (biker farting) You head over to Chaw's and find out what's up. You run into any of them bounty hunters snooping around, you end them! (groaning) Take care of it. - Yo, listen up! If this gets out, Deathface is done, man. If Deathface is done, the Emperors are done. (guttural groaning) Do you know the level of shit that will hit the fan? (screaming) (moist exploding) (hissing) (disgusted muttering) (unintelligible conversing) - So the Deathface Cares concert is gonna be huge, Senator. Biggest charity rock show LA's ever seen. We've already got Night Rattler lined up. You a big Night Rattler fan? - Sorry, Senator, I've never heard of Night Rattler. - Well, they never heard of you, either. (laughing) Still gonna rock your ass off. (laughing) - [Senator] Good one. - Miss Candy, make sure this deadbeat pays for lunch. - You idiots, you let this happen! You were supposed to be on watch. - Don't you ever touch me again! (angry shouting) (hissing deflation) (wind blowing) (uptempo music) (bird chirping) - Thanks for showing up, Ace. You hungry? I took the liberty of ordering some hot wings. They're really good here. - Cut the chit-chat; why'd you call me here? - Look, I'm sure you're missing your soap operas, or cruising the local junior highs or whatever, so I'll make this brief. I'm proposing we partner up. - Partner up? - Think about it: Rod Rosse, the one-man posse, and the Ace of Spades, a dream team. Come on, it's a guaranteed win. - Is that what you called me here for? This sounds like the desperate act of a desperate man. - We pool our resources, catch this kid, and split the haul 50-50, easy. Strictly business. - I'll tell you what I think. I think you can shove it. - We're talking about a lot of money, Ace. - Hey! I don't share my kills with nobody. Especially you, Rosse! I mean-- (slurred mumbling) (thudding) - What's the matter, Ace? Feeling a bit sluggish there? Aw, who's a tired little baby? - [Man's Voice] Uno, dos, tres! (thumping) - [Rod] Give this guy a one-way ticket to TJ, Miguel. (bird chirping) - Give me a pack of Black Lungs, unfiltered. - A'ight then. - Hey, who beat you boy? A little girl punch you? (laughing) - Hey, how you know a girl did this to me? Did somebody tell you that, man? How'd you know that? - A girl did this! (laughing) Sid, did you hear that? - What girl did this? What did she look like? - I don't know, man, she looked like a girl. - Don't be rude! (heavy thumping) You don't wanna make me angry, Gary! - [Gary] Okay, okay, all right, look, look. There, there, that's the girl right there, on the video! (somber music) - [Lana] Excuse me. I'm looking for a guy named Big Papa Booyah. - I ain't seen him in weeks, young lady. Can't do nothing for you. - Look man, I'm not a cop. I just need to talk to him. - What part of can't do nothing for you did you not understand? - I got a business proposition for him. Excuse me? (buzzing) Are you listening? (buzzing) Hey, man, I don't think you heard me. So I'm gonna say this real slow. Big Papa, now. - Okay, okay. Come on, this way. We ain't got all day, lady. Big Papa, you got a visitor. - Big Papa Booyah. - [Big Papa] And who are you? - My name is Lana, and I'm here to make you an offer. - Is this one of them predator catcher shows? Because I ain't trying to hear that, young lady. - No, Big Papa, this is about Revengeance. (rock music) (knocking) (static hissing) (knocking) - Hey man, who are you? - My name's Detective Harry Callahan, with the US government. - Government? What do you want, man? I'm clean. (spitting) - Clean, huh? Then what's this, oregano? - [Chaw] That's medical man. - Listen up, Scarface, I'm not here for you. I need to find your friend, Lana. It's a matter of national security. Where is she, Chaw? - I don't even know where Lana's at, man. She disappeared. Yeah, we were all hanging out and chilling, and then she gets all weird and starts asking me all these questions about them biker dudes. - Hold on, you're talking about the Inland Emperors? - Yeah, it's like she was obsessed with those dudes. What's up with that? - Do you have any idea where she might be headed? - She's got a step-brother named Eric. He works up at the Cha-Cha Boom Club, up in the desert, man. - Eric, huh? (engine revving) Ah, you expecting any company? - [Biker] Open the door, Chaw! Chaw, I'm not gonna say it twice. Chaw! - Hey, is there a back door out of this place? (shouting and crashing) - [Sid] Hey, come here! (rock music) (crashing) - Dude, that dude was the same dude as the plumber. - No, dude, that dude was the government. - [Sid] Shut up, both of you! (rock music) - I've done some bad things, Miss Candy. - [Candy] I know; you've done some of them to me. - You know, I'm a good person. I can bench like 400 pounds, and ah, I'm a good guy. - Bench press all you want, Deathface, but you'll never lift the weight that girl Lana's got on you. She got you all twisted. - Dammit, Miss Candy! (crashing) I love our little talks, girl. Come here! (uptempo mariachi music) - Huh? Oh, that no-good, dirty son of a bitch! (engine rumbling) I'm gonna get you, Rod Rosse! (unintelligible shouting) - Right there, right there, see that? The leg, my leg was on the rope. See there, the ref was supposed to stop the count. What's up with that? Deathface was my homie, yeah, so I thought he was. Then that Royce Vargas got to him, started talking all greasy in Deathface's ear. Built up his ego something fierce. - Sometimes, old wounds never heal. They just fester. - So what you got for me, girl? - It's not what I got for you, but more like, what I got of his. Something that can bring him to his knees. Together, we can bring down Deathface, and that turd, Royce Vargas. - Say no more. Them fools stabbed Big Papa in the back. But you know what, girl? Big Papa kept the knife. (clapping) Hell yeah! - Come one, come all, to the Face Cares charity concert. A day full of mayhem, carnage and rock and roll! I'm Senator Deathface, and I freakin' love kids, man. - Deathface bought my mommy new boobies. - Deathface got my dad acquitted of murder. - Hey kids, come to my concert. Get your asses rocked off! - [Narrator] Rock out with Deathface and all your favorite bands! Night Rattler, Tickler, Side Saddle, Snatch-Dragon! And more! Deathface cares; do you? - [Lana] Jackass. (ringing) - Talk to me. - Odell, it's Big Papa Booyah. Hey, what you know about a girl named Lana, running from Deathface? - I know that girl's worth a lot to Deathface. What might you know, Big Papa? - Well I might know she came to me for help. And I might know she in my house right now. And I might know I want 50 percent of that reward, Odell. - You keep that little trick right there, and I'm gonna be right there. (tires screeching) - I got a lead, ma. I think I know where Lana's headed. - Be careful for those bikers, Roddy, they're bad news. - Stop worrying about me, ma. I can take care of myself. - Well, don't try and be a hero, Roddy. You're not your father. - Yeah, thanks for the vote of confidence there. - Oh, Roddy. You better not poop on my rug. - Stop talking to the cats when you're on the phone with me! (rustling) (sizzling) - [Lana] So, what do you like in your tea? - [Big Papa] Big Papa don't drink no tea. - [Lana] Then why do you have tea? - [Big Papa] I don't know. Why do I have nipples? (sputtering) - [Lana] You know, this type of greasy food's okay once in a while, but you should really think about eating healthier. - I got like raisins in there; they're healthy. - Chocolate raisins don't count. You know, at first, I wasn't even sure if I could trust you, but I gotta admit, I'm having fun with you as a partner. - [Big Papa] Lots of fun, girl. - [Lana] I don't see how you could partner with Deathface in the first place. That guy, he's such a back-stabber. No loyalty. (somber music) If there's one thing I value, Big Papa, it's-- (pistol cocking) Loyalty. - Put down the breakfast, Lana. And put your hands in the air. You're coming with me. (clattering) Oh, you did it now. (gun firing) You wanna play me, bitch? (laughing) - Get her, Odell. (gun firing) You gonna pay for that door, Lana. (whooshing) (hissing) (whooshing) (booming explosion) - Hope you like your bacon extra crispy. (rustling) (buzzing) (uptempo music) - Hey, there's a $12 cover. - $12, what, is there a seafood buffet in there? (uptempo music) - Hey there, baby, what can I get you to drink tonight? - I'll take a beer, Old Gold. - Sweetie, does this look like the type of place that serves Old Gold? - All right then, just give me something fancy. - [Bartender] All right, here's one tough cookie, guy. (slurping) - Hey, I'm looking for a guy named Eric. He's supposed to work here. - Eric? Oh, you mean DJ E-Money; he's over there. (uptempo music) - Bingo. Our girl Lana. Well, it's time for Rod Rosse, the one-man posse, to go to work. (uptempo music) Who, excuse me. - Sorry. - No worries. So, what's your name. - Hey man, she's not into you, all right. Just leave her alone. - Why don't you mind your business, Eric? - Wait a minute, how do you know my name is Eric? Lana, get out of here, go! - Hey, let go of my arm! Come on, hey! (strained grunting) - You're adorable, look at you! - [Rod] Hey, hey, put me down, put me down! (muffled shouting) - The senator has been looking for you. (pained shouting) (grunting) You fight me, I fight back! (stomping) (thudding) You! I'll clean up your ugly face, Rod! (scuffling) Come on, Rod, don't pass out yet! (heavy thumping) (somber music) (crunching) (laughing) Would you like some CheeziO's? Breakfast of champions. You're costing me a whole lot of money, Rosse. Because of you, I lost her. I'm not gonna kill you. No, I'm gonna let nature take its nature-y course. Good luck with the heatstroke and rattlesnakes, Rosse. (bird screeching) (somber music) (hissing) (rattling) (chittering) (rustling) (panting) - Hey, Rod Rosse, you're gonna die! (laughing) - Hello, Roddy. - Okay, now I know I have heatstroke. - Been a long time, son. Look where you find yourself. Abandoned, alone in this hot desert. - Oh, fine thank you, and how are you, dad? - Roddy, you can throw your own life into the shitter, but there are two ladies out there who need you. Your mother, and that girl, Lana. - Why did you sign me up for football, daddy? - Don't let your mind wander. Concentrate, son! - Coach made me run laps. - Focus boy! You need to help that girl, Lana. You're all she's got. Those bikers are gonna kill her. Do the right thing, son. Make me proud. (chittering) - Dad? Where are you going? Daddy! (groaning) (somber music) - [Man's Voice] Behold what the desert has revealed to us, brothers! - Who is this guy? - [Man's Voice] Could he be part of the prophecy? - We must take him to the master! - I'm sorry, what? (eerie music) - [Man's Voice] Master, we have a visitor. We found him alone in the desert. - Uh, thanks for the ride, but where am I? (cultists chanting) Hey, could I get some water? - Greetings, traveler. Welcome to Zornatopia. Children of Zorna, behold! We have received a gift from the stars above. - Ah, yeah, thanks, but seriously, does anybody got any water? - The prophecy has been fulfilled! All praise Zorna! - Do you guys get cell service out here? - Now at last, the awakening can begin! - Water, tea, diet soda; I'll take anything. - Ladies, if you will? (ominous music) - [Chanting] Zorna! All praise Zorna! Zorna, Zorna, all praise Zorna! - Hey, I don't know if you guys are having some kind of desert rave or what, but I gotta get outta here. - [Chanting] Zorna, all praise Zorna! Zorna, Zorna, all praise Zorna! - Come forth, and bring thy gift to the altar of Zorna. - Hey, can somebody call me a cab? - [Master] It's time! (cheering and applauding) Oh great Zorna, queen of the stars, we thank thee for they sacrifice, which we shall now partake in! - I'm sorry, what? (cheering) Look, whatever you're planning to do, don't do it. How about I write you a check? (screaming) What the? - Oh great Zorna, goddess of the space armada, we sacrifice this star child to thee! (ominous music) (whooshing) (screaming) - Let him go. - By Zorna, I command thee to kill them! Kill 'em both! (guns firing) (engine revving) (guns firing) (Zornites screaming) (tires screeching) (shouting) Don't let them get away! (guns firing) (shouting and thumping) Get me out of here! - I hope you have an exit plan. - Open the glove compartment. (shouting) (guns firing) (tires screeching) (screaming) - [All Chanting] Praise Zorna, praise Zorna, praise Zorna. (whistling) (exploding) Praise Zorna! (muffled speaking) (exploding) - Remind me to stay on your good side. (phone ringing) - Yeah? (unintelligible murmuring) Yeah. You let me know if anything changes. - What is it? - That was the chief of police. Lana was spotted at the Cha-Cha Boom. Our bounty hunters just missed her. - Goddammit, Face! I told you, those bounty vermin are useless. We should have just hired a hit on that girl! - You wanna say that a little louder? I don't think they heard you on the 13th floor. - You shut your 10-dollar mouth, you hussy! Look, I'm just saying, I have a lot invested in all of this, the stakes are too high. We don't have room for mistakes. If the press gets wind of what that little puta stole, we're all ca-ca! - Royce, why don't you just put a lid on it. - You gonna let her talk to me like that, Face? - Would the both of you shut the hell up? Now I'm just gonna have to improvise. (beeping) (chiming) (chiming) (chiming) - What is it? - Well, it looks like Deathface just raised the stakes to find you. Look, my name's Rod Rosse. I'm a bounty hunter. - Bounty hunter? You look more like an accountant to me. - Deathface said you stole something from him. You're a fugitive. - Oh, is that what you heard? Well, it's time that you learned the truth. (somber music) By the way, you totally scream like a girl. (engine rumbling) (twanging) - Good girl, Lana. You did it, baby! That's my daughter. - Nice shot, good form. Watch your elbows, sweetie. That little girl is gonna be something special, sis. Lana, one day you'll be ready for the Olympics, honey. You and Kurt should really think about sending her away from this place, give her a chance. - Don't lie to me, Deathface. Just the other day, Lana said she saw you all dressed up in your wrestling tights. - Little kids make up stuff. You know, like unicorns. - Are you calling my little girl a liar, Face? - No, no, Kurt, no man, I'm just saying, I'm a biker man, not a wrestler. - You step into my face and you lie to me, and you lie to my daughter, you're asking for a chin check, my friend. - Look, Kurt, I'm sorry man. The kid's confused, that's all, that's all I'm saying. - You need to stay away from that rat, Royce Vargas. He's trying to turn you into some kind of Bitchface, the Wrestler. (laughing) By the way, a little unicorn found these behind the shed. Watch yourself, Deathface. (ripping) - [Kristi] Kurt, it's late, come on. Come to bed, baby. - He's up to something, Kristi. I think he's plotting to take the Emperors away from me. - Deathface is your vice. You've ridden together for years; why would he? - Because he's a greedy sum'bitch, that's why. And I'll tell you what, I started the Emperors. I'll be the one to end them. Not Royce Vargas. (sirens wailing) - What is it? - Attention, Kurt Oswald, you have officially been impeached. - That back-stabbing sum'bitch! - [Royce] There's been a change of the guard in the Inland Emperors. - Chrissy, get Lana and get out of the house! - Come out and let's do this the civil way. Or you can die in the street like a dog. Which I personally prefer. - You wanna take the Inland Emperors from me? Come get it. - Kurt, I'm taking this from you man. One way or another. - After all we've done for you, Deathface! We started the Emperors, this is ours! (spitting) - [Officer] Come on, lady, get out of here. Let's go. - [Deathface] Consider this a hostile takeover. - [Royce] Let's do this already; I'm sleepy. - [Deathface] Burn it down. - Oh no. Oh, oh no! I promise, one day you'll understand, baby. - No, mommy! Daddy, no! No! Mommy, no! - Kristi! Why'd you come back? I told you to go. - We started this together, and we're gonna end this together, Kurt! (barking) (somber music) - My aunt took me under her wing. She never stopped coaching me in archery. It's like she was preparing me for something. We hit the road, traveling the US. Staying under the radar. My auntie was an interesting character to say the least. She'd meet the lowest of the lows in dive bars. Predators, ex-cons, you name it. She'd lure them back to he motel room, and give those perverts what they deserved. They would never know what hit them. She called that: fixing that which needs to be fixed. And now I got one thing left to fix. (somber music) Deathface took everything from me. Now I'm gonna take everything from him. - So Deathface took out your parents for his own, personal gain. What a douche-bag. - You don't know the half of it, Rod Rosse. You see, my aunt got sick a few months back. Real bad. Before she passed, she made me promise to let go of this anger. - Child, you gotta let it go. - Letting go is easier said than done. My aunt told me about this secret Deathface is keeping. Something he doesn't want anybody to know. It was in my daddy's vault, but now I got it. Right here. I started sweet-talking this small time weed dealer, Chaw. He sometimes sold to the Emperors. A perfect way for me to keep tabs on them. Next step: payback. - Ah, this is twisted. So Royce Vargas finds Deathface as a bum biker, turns him into a wrestling champ, and then a senator? So what do you want from Deathface? - Revengeance. - I'm pretty sure that's not a word. (phone ringing) Hold that thought. Yeah, ma? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, ma. Ma, ma, things are not what they seem. Yeah, no, no, no. I'll explain, hold on, hold on. Hey, Lana, Lana what are you doing? Hey! Great, there goes my ride. (guitar music) - Long time no see, bounty hunter! (engines revving) (pained shouting) (coughing) (scraping) - Greetings, son. My, what happened to you? - Oh, man, some fools came in starting some mess with me. But I'm like, you know, I handle myself. - Child, I'm wondering if you've seen this girl, and the man that was with her? - Hey, that's that girl that sucker-punched me! Why everybody looking for her? - Now listen, child, this is of great universal importance. - Well hey now, hold up a minute there, old man. It seem like Gary got something that you want. So Gary got to gets paid, you know what I'm saying? So I'm thinking like, hey, hey! (strangled grunting) (rock music) (engine revving) - Hey, wait, wait, wait, fellas, fellas wait! Hey look, look, whatever you guys are thinking of doing, you don't need to do it. We can make a deal! - Deal? This ain't Wheel of Fortune, you stupid bounty hunter. - Hey man, you're thinking of Let's Make a Deal. - Shut your pie-hole! - Look, we're on the same team! - Shut up! I've been caught by your kind before. Yeah, you're always a step ahead, right? Always thinking, huh? Like a cop without a badge. Bounty hunters are lower than scum. How does it feel to be the hunted, and not the hunter? - He ain't hunted no more; we caught him! - Shut up! - [Radio] You're rolling with the Shademan, and Heatseeker Radio! 81 degrees in Los Angeles, and we got a hot one for you, babies. Don't forget, Heatseeker Radio presents: Face Cares. A charity concert brought to you by none other than Senator Deathface, himself! (clicking) (horn blowing) - I'm gonna get you, girlie! (uptempo music) (crashing) (tires screeching) (growling) (uptempo music) (crashing) (doors slamming) (engine revving) - Where's she headed man? - Tell us, man, where is she headed? - [Sid] Did you tell her we were onto her? - Did you tell her we're onto her, man? - Quit repeating my questions, you idiot! (phone ringing) Oh, it's your mommy. Oh, I'm sorry, the bounty hunter can't come to the phone right now. He's about to get his face ripped off. (laughing) - Why don't you turn around and say it to my face, punk? (sizzling crackle) (pained groaning) - How did you find me, ma? - I told you these bikers were trouble, Roddy. So I sewed a tracker into your underwear. - No wonder I'm all chafed. - We gotta get the hell out of Dodge. Come on, get on! (tires screeching) (shouting) (uptempo rock) (sizzling and shouting) (uptempo music) (panting) (moist bouncing) - Oh, you've done it now, girl. (twanging) (uptempo music) (screaming) Where you going, girlie? You can't run, and you cannot hide. (scrabbling) (screaming) (struggling groans) - That's what you get. - Well hello! Going my way? (laughing) (bell dinging) (struggling groans) - Yeah, Deathface, like I was saying, this big, Navy Seal guy came in. He had a strike team and stuff. And that's how the bounty hunter escaped. Yeah. He had a helicopter, yeah, yeah, that's how it happened. - Now why'd you have to ruin my workout with such bad news? - Deathface, you got a phone call. - Somebody better tell me something good, real soon. What's up? - [Voice On Phone] Hey man, Sticky spotted that bounty hunter down in Long Beach, man. - Sid, Cujo, get to that bounty hunter's office, pronto! (engine sputtering) (whistling) - Looks like we got a package, ma. You expecting anything? - We need to get in there. You need to feed the cats, Roddy. - [Rod] Those two apes are guarding the door. - Mister Butterkisses needs his worm medicine. - Well, do you got any bright ideas? - Signed, sealed and delivered. - [Deathface] Why is she still breathing? - [Ace] I thought we had some options with that. - Just give me the bag already. - There's something very important missing from this bag! - Look, I've been driving all night. - You idiot, she tricked you! - Deathface, you're scheduled to go on stage. We gotta go. - You just wrote yourself a one-way ticket to Deadville, my darling. (clanging) - What the hell was that? - I think it's the meter; it's expired. - Well, then pay it, dummy. - I'm not gonna pay, It's your turn this time. - I ain't gonna pay it. If I say it's your turn, it's your turn. - Why do I have to pay? It's your turn this time. - I already got like 50 tickets man. I can't afford another one. - I mean, no you listen, now, I'm not paying this time. (muffled arguing) (meowing) (muffled arguing) I got a ticket, I could go to jail for 15 years. - No, I'm out of quarters anyway. (tires screeching) (engine rumbling) (uptempo rock) - Hey everybody. How y'all doing tonight? (uptempo rock) I know y'all came ready to rock, baby! You ready to rock with me? ♪ You got a beautiful face, I got a beautiful place ♪ ♪ So do you wanna rock with me? ♪ (uptempo rock) - This is Connie Sanchez, reporting live for Channel Three News. Excuse me, ma'am, how do you feel about the charity work Deathface Cares is doing? (clinking) (chugging) - Woo! Party, dude! (retching) - Who's here to party? You're rolling with the Shademan, and Heatseeker Radio! (screaming) I've got wristbands for any of the ladies who wanna do a little flashing for the Shademan. (shouting and cheering) - I bet you're thinking I ain't such a nice person. Is that right? You know where nice gets you? Nice gets you working at some scumbag strip bar, in Victorville. It's sleeping with the greasy, toothless manager so he pays you for overtime that he owes you. Until the day some coked-out professional wrestler comes along and takes you to his condo in Redondo Beach, promising to change your life. That's where nice gets you. - Boo-hoo-hoo. (smacking) - That right there was reality slapping you in the face. Deathface ain't gonna play so nice. (guitar music) (cheering) - Give it up for US senator and undisputed heavyweight wrestling champion of the world, the man, the myth, the reality: Senator Deathface! (cheering) - Welcome to Face Cares! Who's ready to party? I can't hear you! (cheering) Who's ready to give me all your money? (cheering) - Okay, Roddy, now if what you're telling me is true about this Lana, there's no turning back. - Ma, I've seen what's on this tape. Believe me, I wish I could un-see it. Now, are you ready to do this? (engine rumbling) (banging) - Hey, go and see what she wants. - What's your problem? - I gotta go to the bathroom, man. - You gotta go to the bathroom? - Look man, just untie my feet. I really gotta go. - Ah, I don't know. Hey, hey Sid? - Look at you, you're a huge dude. I don't even weigh three digits. What, you gotta ask your boss? Is that dude your boss? I knew you were a big chicken. - [Cujo] I'll show you a chicken! (bashing and groaning) - All right, everybody, I know when some of you think of Deathface, you think of championships. But I'm gonna be the champion of charity! Deathface Cares will make it a better world for the children of the world. Bring out that kid. What's your name, kid? - Reed. - Tell everybody, Reed, how has Deathface Cares helped you? - Deathface Cares has helped me to go camping and fishing, and do all kinds of fun things. - And the future? - And to build my future. - All right, kid, thanks a lot. (grunting) So, are you all ready to party? (whooping and cheering) I want you to dig deep into those pockets and give to Deathface Cares! (whooping) (tense music) (surprised shouting) - Well, so nice to see you, Mister Rosse. Looking for your friend, Lana? Oh, I'd like nothing better than to snap your little pencil neck like a twig, you back-stabbing son of a-- - I need to talk to the senator. - Well, you are on the senator's naughty list. You've been a bad, bad boy, Mr. Rosse. - Look lady, I don't want any trouble. - Well, trouble's got you by the neck. Deathface ain't the only one who was a wrestler. - Aw, come on! Everybody knows wrestling's fake. (banging) - Ow, ow, ow, ow! (groaning) (guitar music) - Great job, Face! The money's rolling in! - Why don't you get out there and make sure the money's collected then, Royce? Do your job. - Hey, Mr. Big Shot, don't bark orders at me. - This dog barks when he wants to bark. And I bite, too. - Face, we got a problem. - What do you mean, problem? - Hey, I just found him like this, man. The girl's gone. - When that idiot wakes up, knock him out again. - Well, I might have found something that will help with our search. (knocking) - Hello, Miss Sanchez. - Yes, what can I do for you? - I think we should have a word. - Let's just cut to the chase, bounty hunter. I know you're running with Lana. I just wanna know why. How'd you let that happen? - Yeah right about now, I'm asking myself the same question. - I want you to listen to me and listen to me real careful, Rod Rosse. - Ugh, where'd she go? (thumping) - [Deathface] Where is the tape? - This footage is incredible. Have you taken it to any other stations? - No, Connie, I'm offering you an exclusive. That story you did on the kittens in the storm drain, oh, it was just adorable. - Surely there must be something you want for this. - Well, there is one little thing you could do for me. When's your next live feed? - [Rod] Senator, I came here to make you a deal. - A deal? - You call off the hunt for Lana, and we give you the tape, simple as that. - How about this deal: I cut your head off, use it as a punch bowl, throw a party for my dogs, and feed them the rest of your body, piece by piece. - This is not quite how I saw this negotiation going, to be honest with you. (laughing) (thudding) (pained shouting) - Choose your next words very carefully, Deathface. Are you gonna let him go, or do I gotta shish kebab this bitch? - Baby, do something. (pained grunting) - Go ahead, Lana, kill her. See what I care. - Deathface, she ain't playing around. She's really gonna do it. - But the second you let that arrow fly, you're done. - How could you?! - Now, we can play nice, or we can-- (chomping) (pained shouting) - [Rod] Let's go! (squawking) - We got a situation! Lock the front gate; don't let them get off the perimeter! (engines rumbling) (dramatic music) Scoot over! (dramatic music) (hissing) (guns cocking) - At last, by the power of Zorna, we have found you! You have escaped my grasp once before, star child. But now you're screwed. (engines rumbling) - Back off, Yoda. These are my prizes. - I beg to differ, motorcycled man. Zorna demands a sacrifice. (tense music) (gun firing) - One sacrifice, paid in full. - They killed the master! (angry shouting) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Lana, I think it's time we split this party. (sirens wailing) (rock music) Lana, I gotta thank you again. You keep saving my life. It's becoming a habit. - You're not saved yet, Rosse. Please tell me you got the tape. - Oh, it's a doozy. The tape is safe. - Which is more than I can say for you two. - Oh, crap. - You two are making this way too easy for me. (laughing) I mean, look, no witnesses. - I'm not afraid of you, Deathface. And I'm not afraid to die! - Hey, whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Lana. - Well, Lana, you tried, just like your folks did. I'm gonna enjoy this. - Deathface, you back-stabbing son of a mud duck! You were gonna let her kill me, weren't you? - Easy there, Miss Candy. Put the gun down. Look into my eyes, Miss Candy. - And after all the things I've done for you. And to you, you slimy, side-winding piece of human garbage! You were gonna let her put an arrow through my head! I'ma kill you! - Who's the one who found you in that strip club? Who's the one who turned you into Miss Candy, wrestling superstar? Who's the one who made you? Do I need to remind you? (slurping) I still got it. Now you're gonna get it. - Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? My name is Connie Sanchez, with Channel Three News. You probably recognize me. I have in my possession something that I need to show you. Something that Senator Deadface and Royce Vargas do not want the world to see. Now, I must warn you, it is quite graphic in nature. Freddie, roll the tape. - Okay, Deathface, we're rolling. Whenever you're ready. (cutesy uptempo music) Oh, you bad little girl! (kissing) (smacking and slapping) (bestial braying) ♪ I try not to need you so much ♪ ♪ You were the one, right from the start, ♪ ♪ Your eyes are saying the same ♪ (smacking and bouncing) Now you show Royce how bad you wanna be heavyweight champion of the world! (smacking) Oh, no. (groaning) (shrieking) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic music) - Stop the tape. We could show you more, but it would literally cause this reporter to vomit uncontrollably. I think we can all agree that this shocking video may signal the end to Senator Deathface's career. (dramatic music) (gun cocking) (gun firing) (whistling exhalation) - The funeral for Senator Deathface will be led by a precession of bikers from the Inland Emperors motorcycle club. Full honors for the senator's burial. Wrestling fans, bikers, and a who's who of politicians will be there to pay their respects. Rest in peace, Senator Deathface, from the Shademan, and Heatseeker Radio. (bird calling) - After everything Deathface has done, they still give him a hero's sendoff? - Well, he was a senator. I guess the scumbag part was just an added perk. - What's going to happen to Royce Vargas? - After all that money he embezzled from that charity, I'm sure he'll make somebody a good body pillow in prison. Hey, when we first met, you said I scream like a girl. You were kidding, right? Right? - [Lana] Yeah, so anyways. - [Rod] So, I heard a bunch of those bikers quit now that you're taking over the club. - Yeah, those are the ones that were loyal to Deathface. The rest, they'll report to me. After all, I am biker royalty. Look, you've helped me a lot. I want you to have this. - Wait, what's this for? - It's for the services of Rod Rosse, the one-man posse. - You never hired my services. - In a roundabout way, you actually helped me find Deathface. (kissing) Keep hunting, Rod Rosse. One day you'll find it, whatever it is. By the way, you totally do scream like a girl. (tires screeching) - Where you going in such a rush, Rosse? - Ah, long time no see, Ace. How you been? - What's in the bag? - [Rod] My lunch. - [Ace] I guess this is your lunch money, then. I'm taking it, Rosse. Hey, what's this? - That's just a thing I'm keeping from my mom. A thing? Well now, let's just see if this thing does a thing. - No, Ace, you don't wanna mess with that.

And you're under arrest! - Hello, Mr. Rosse. You did some work for us a few years back. The Milsap case? - The Inland Emperors; those are some bad seeds, Roddy. Be careful! - This is one of those keep your mouth shut moments, Rosse. Any of you ever keep a diary? - Children of the stars, behold! We have received a gift from Zorna herself!
