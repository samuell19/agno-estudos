REST ASSURED EVERYONE HERE IS FOLLOWING COVID-19 PROTOCOLS AND GUIDE LINES, THIS WILL BE THE AWARD SHOW WHERE THE WHITE STUFF GOING UP PEOPLE'S NOSESES COTTON SWABS. THIS LOOKS DIFFERENT, THE WHOLE THING IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT BUT FOLKS WILL BE EVEN MORE EXCITED BECAUSE OUR IMPRESSIVE NOMINEES WILL BE SITTING AT THOSE TABLES FOR THEIR AWARDS.

I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA FROM NEW MEXICO IN 20134. I WOULD TAKE LIKE TWO TRAINS THEN TWO BUSES TO THE SANTA MONICA PIER JUST TO BUSK. STREET PERFORMING FOR ME, IT IS KIND OF A LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP, SUCH AS BEAUTIFUL YET BRUTAL EXPERIENCE. I WOULD BE PERFORMING IN THE STREET BUT IN MY MIND I'M PERFORMING ON THE STAGE OF THE GRAMMYS. KSH WITHIN MYSELF AS A KID I REMEMBER IMAGINING WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TOKING ON SUCH A GRAND STAGE.

NOW, THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR US ALL. I MEAN, WE'VE HAD TO DO EVERYTHING OVER ZOOM-- WEDDINGS, WORK, COLONOSCOPIES. BUT SOME OF THE BUSINESSES HIT HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN THE INDEPENDENT MUSIC VENUES ALL OVER AMERICA THAT HAVEN'T HAD AUDIENCES IN THEIR ICONIC BUILDINGS FOR A YEAR. SO, TONIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO GO TO A FEW OF THESE PRECIOUS INDEPENDENT MUSIC VENUES AROUND THIS COUNTRY AND GIVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CREATED SUCH LOVING HOMES FOR MUSIC THE HONOR OF PRESENTING SOME OF THIS YEAR'S GRAMMY AWARDS. LET'S GO FIRST TO NASHVILLE, TENESSEE, TO THE STATION INN, AND MEET J.T. GRAY. (APPLAUSE) I'M JT GRAY, I'M THE OWNER OF THE STATION INN IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. MUSIC, IT IS ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY, PLAYING HAPPY MUSIC AND HAVING A HAPPY TIME, YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE AT STATION INN. VINS GILL USED TO PLAY ON MONDAY NIGHT, CHRIS STAPLETON USED TO PLAY WITH THE STEEL DRIVERS. THERE WAS A BAND PLAYED EVERY TUESDAY NIGHT CALLED THE SIDEMEN AND HE STARTED COMING DOWN AND HANGING OUT, AND DIRKS WILL TELL YOU TODAY THAT IS WHERE HE LEARNED TO PLAY AND STING QUITE HERE AT THE STATION INN. WHEN COVID HIT WE HAD TO CLOSE DOWN, WE HAD NO IDEA AT THAT TIME WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO. BIGGER NAME VENUES CAN SUSTAIN REVENUE LOSS A LOT MORE THAN A PRIVATELY OWNED SMALL VENUE LIKE THE STATION INN. WE JUST HOPE THAT ALL THE OTHER SMALL VENUES GET TO BE BACK IN BUSINESS ALONG WITH US REAL SOON BECAUSE MUSIC IS THERAPY FOR PEOPLE. GETTING TO REOPEN THE STATION INN IS GOING TO BE A CELEBRATION LIKE NEVER BEFORE. THERE IS GOING TO BE A BIG PARTY. IN THE MEANTIME, I'M HONORED TO BE PRESENTING THE GRAMMY AWARD FOR BEST COUNTRY ALBUM. HERE ARE THE NOMINATIONS. ♪ ♪ ♪ "LADY LIKE," INGRID ANDRESS. "YOUR LIFE IS A RECORD," BRANDY CLARK.

WELCOME BACK. TO PRESENT OUR NEXT GRAMMY AWARD, LET'S GO TO THE HEART OF HARLEM AND PERHAPS THE MOST HISTORIC INDEPENDENT VENUE IN AMERICA. LET'S MEET BILLY MITCHELL AT ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC PLACES FOR MUSICIANS TO PERFORM, AND FOR COMEDIANS TO GET BOOED OFFSTAGE: THE WORLD FAMOUS APOLLO THEATER. MY NAME IS BILLY MITCHELL, THEY CALL ME MR. APPALLO, I FIRST STARTED RUNNING ERRANDS AT THE THEATER, I USED TO RUN ERRANDS FOR JAMES BROWN AND HIS BAND. HE WOULD ALWAYS ASK ME, MR. BILLY, HOW ARE YOU DOING IN SCHOOL, I WOULD SAY I'M DOING GREAT, AND APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME, BECAUSE ONE DAY MR. BROWN MADE ME LEAVE THE APPALLO, GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BRONX, GET MY REPORT CARD AND SHOW IT TO HIM. AND WHEN JAMES BROWN NOTICED MY REPORT CARD HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO COME BACK TO THE APPALLO AND RUNNER RANDS UNTIL I GOT MY GRADES UP. SO WITH THAT THREAT IN MIND, I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE HONOR ROLL AND AS A GRADUATION GIFT JAMES BROWN GAVE ME SOME MONEY. I USED THAT MONEY TO ENROLL INTO BUSINESS SCHOOL AND THAT STARTED MY CAREER AT THE APPALLO THEATER. THANK YOU JAMES BROWN. THIS WAS THE FIRST YEAR THEATER THAT NOT ONLY SHOWED BLACK TALENT ON THE STAGE BUT THE FIRST THAT HIRED BLACK CREW AND ALSO LET BLACKS SIT IN THE AUDIENCE. THE APPALLO WAS THE FIRST THEATER IN HARLEM TO DO THAT. CULTURALLY THIS PLACE IS LIKE THE BEACON FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS BUILDING. IT IS SO HEARTBREAKING, WE MISS OUR AUDIENCE AND WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL OUR DOORS ARE OPEN BACK UP AGAIN. WE JUST CAN'T WAIT. AND WE DO OPEN BACK UP, IT IS GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

THERE IS A REAL SENSE OF COMMUNITY HERE AMONGST THE MUSICIANS AND PATRONS ALIKE. IT HAS GOT A REALLY LOVING COMMUNAL ENERGY. THE LAST TIME WE HAD AN AUDIENCE HERE AT THE HOTEL CAFE WAS EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO, MARCH 14th. THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN TOUGH, YOU KNOW. I MEAN THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A JOB TO ME. THIS IS MY FAMILY, THIS IS MY COMMUNITY. AND FOR THIS PLACE TO NO LONGER EXIST WOULD BE DEVASTATING. IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING. I DEFINITELY DO MISS MY REGULARS THAT I AM USED TO SEEING HERE ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT, JOHN, HE WANTS A DIET COKE, PHIL GETS A BOTTINGTON, PETER I KNOW HE WANTS AN OLD-FASHIONED. IT IS MY HONOR TO PRESENT THE GRAMMY FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR. HERE ARE THE NOMINATIONS. Announcer: "CHILOMBO," JHENÉ AIKO. "BLACK PUMAS (DELUXE EDITION)," BLACK PUMAS. "EVERYDAY LIFE," COLDPLAY.

WE WILL NEVER FORGET THAT YOU DID THIS FOR US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪ ♪ Announcer: STILL TO COME: RODDY RICCH, BTS, AND THEN THE FINAL AWARD OF THE NIGHT: RECORD OF THE YEAR. THIS IS CBS. ♪ ♪ ♪ (APPLAUSE) Trevor: TONIGHT, I'M NOT JUST THE HOST OF THE GRAMMY AWARDS, I'M THE OPENING ACT FOR A GREAT SONGWRITER, MUSIC AND FILM PRODUCER WHO ALSO IS THE RECORDING ACADEMY CHAIR AND INTERIM PRESIDENT AND C.E.O. HE ALSO HAND-SCULPTED EVERY GRAMMY STATUE HERE TONIGHT. HARVEY MASON, JR. NOW, NORMALLY, THIS IS WHEN SOME ONE WOULD WALK OUT ONSTAGE, AND YOU'D ALL TAKE A BATHROOM BREAK. BUT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THIS YEAR, WE'RE DOING THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. SO TAKE A LOOK. MUSIC REQUIRES LISTENING. YOU HEAR THE VOCALS. THE DRUMS. THE RHYTHM GUITAR. YOU LISTEN MORE CLOSELY AND YOU WILL HEAR SO MUCH MORE. LISTEN TO A SINGER-SONGWRITER TRYING TO MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE BIG CITY, A KID, LISTEN HOPE, AND HEARTBREAK. TO LATE NIGHTS IN THE ST AUDIO TO MONTHS ON THE ROAD, THE SILENT UNCERTAINTY THE NEXT DAY. LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF YOUR GENERATION, THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE YOU, AND THOSE WHO ARE NEXT. LISTEN TO THE SIGNATURE SOUND OF A GREAT PRODUCER, THE BACKUP SINGERS WHO SING ALONG WHOSE NAMES YOU MAY NEVER KNOW. LISTEN TO LOVE. TO DEDICATION PUT INTO EVERY SONG, EVERY ALBUM. TO THE YEARS OF HARD WORK THAT GO INTO EVERY OVERNIGHT SUCCESS. LISTEN TO THE WORK LIFE'S WORK OF PEOPLE WHO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO THIS WORK. THE RECORDING ACADEMY'S JOB ISN'T JUST TO HAND OUT AWARDS, IT IS TO LISTEN TO THE MUG MUSIC AND TO HEAR THE VOICES OF ALL THOSE WHO MAKE IT. AND WE ARE LISTENING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE HEAR THE CRIES FOR DIVERSITY, THE PLEAS FOR REPRESENTATION AND DEMANDS FOR TRANSPARENCY. I FIRST JOINED THE ACADEMY 20 YEARS AGO SO I COULD VOTE FOR MYSELF. BUT WHAT I QUICKLY FOUND, WHAT LED ME TO BECOME A TRUSTY AND NOW CHAIR. BOARD IS THAT THE RECORDING ACADEMY IS SO MUCH MORE THAN AWARDS, MORE THAN INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS OR EVEN WHO IS CHAIR. TONIGHT I'M HERE TO ASK THE ENTIRE MUSIC COMMUNITY TO JOIN IN, WORK WITH US, NOT AGAINST US, AS WE BUILD A NEW RECORDING ACADEMY THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. ONE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK AND SERVE EVERYONE IN THE INDUSTRY. AND WE MIGHT NOT GET IT RIGHT 100 PERCENT OF THE TIME AND WE CERTAINLY WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY BUT WE WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT IN TIMES OF NEED. WE WILL PRESERVE MUSIC AND EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION. WE WILL ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS OF ALL CREATORS TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO EARN A FAIR LIVING MAKING MUSIC. AND WE WILL STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND FIGHT FOR GREATER DIVERSITY AND MORE EQUAL REPRESENTATION. THIS IS NOT A VISION FOR TOMORROW, ST A JOB FOR TODAY. OUR WORK IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MUSIC IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT, HARVEY, I WAS LISTENING AND THAT SOUNDED GREAT. NOW IT'S TIME YEAR NOMINEE FILM FROM THE VISIONARY GIBSON HAZARD. THIS TIME IT'S ABOUT A GIFTED YOUNG ARTIST WHO EARLIER TONIGHT HELPED US KICK OFF THE SHOW. SHE'S ALSO THE REASON PARENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE LOOKING AT THEIR TEENAGERS, ASKING, "WHAT HAVE YOU ACHIEVED?" THIS IS BILLIE EILISH. THIS IS BILLIE EILISH. THERE WAS LIKE A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE I LIKE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SLEEP BECAUSE I WAS FREAKED OUT BY MY DREAMS. SLEEP PARALYSIS, NIGHTMARES, LUCID DREAMS. IT WAS SUCH A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE. AND SO I KIND OF WAS LIKE HOW CAN I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING THAT HAVE I TO DEAL WITH. WHY DON'T I LET IT INSPIRE ME. MY BROTHER FINNEAS HAS BEEN MY BEST FRIEND FOR MY WHOLE LIFE. WE WROTE THIS SONG ABOUT BEING THERE FOR EACH OTHER. SO WHEN I HEAR IT, I JUST FEEL SO LOVED AND I FEEL SO COMFORTED AND SAFE AND WARM. 2020 GRAMMYS. MAYBE THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. AND THE GRAMMY. AND THE GRAMMY. AND THE GRAMMY GOES TO. BILLIE EILISH. BAD GUY, BILLIE EILISH. BAD GUY, WHEN WE FALL ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO. BILLIE EILISH. THE FACT THAT WE WROTE THAT ALBUM IN OUR CHILDHOOD HOME, THAT'S CRAZY. THAT WAS AMAZING. I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY. (APPLAUSE) Trevor: BILLIE EILISH, EVERYONE! WHAT A TALENT. THE GRAMMY AWARDS ARE A TRULY GLOBAL EVENT, AND WE ARE NOW THRILLED TO BE JOINED BY A KOREAN GROUP THAT MADE HISTORY WITH THEIR FIRST EVER GRAMMY NOMINATION THIS YEAR. PERFORMING THEIR NOMINATED SMASH "DYNAMITE," THIS IS BTS.

NOW, I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU, BUT THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY TOUGH YEAR FOR TEACHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE TEACHING MUSIC. IF YOU THINK YOUR WORK ZOOM CALLS ARE BAD, TRY TEACHING AN EIGHT YEAR OLD WITH SPOTTY WiFi HOW TO PLAY TROMBONE. AND THAT'S WHY I'M VERY HONORED TO PRESENT THE MUSIC EDUCATOR AWARD. THIS IS PRESENTED BY THE RECORDING ACADEMY AND GRAMMY MUSEUM TO RECOGNIZE CURRENT EDUCATORS WHO HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO MUSIC EDUCATION. THIS YEAR'S MUSIC EDUCATOR AWARD GOES TO DR. JEFFREY MURDOCK, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF CHORAL ACTIVITIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT FAYETTEVILLE. (APPLAUSE) I'M ALSO HONORED TO ANNOUNCE THAT EARLIER TODAY, THE GRAMMY AWARD FOR PRODUCER OF THE YEAR, NON-CLASSICAL WENT TO ANDREW WATT. (APPLAUSE) ALL NIGHT TONIGHT, WE HAVE BEEN FEATURING OUR RECORD OF YEAR NOMINEES WHO WERE PERFORMING. BUT NOW WE WANT TO ALSO SPOTLIGHT BEYONCÉ'S IMPACTFUL RECORD, "BLACK PARADE," A POWERFUL STATEMENT ABOUT SHARING JOY EVEN AMID STRUGGLE. IT WAS CREATED TO UPLIFT, AND HAS BECOME MORE THAN A SONG, BUT A MOVEMENT TO SUPPORT SMALL BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES.
