NARRATOR: Our tale has been sung by bards and minstrels down through the centuries. The legend of Gawain and the Green Knight. Long ago, when pagan gods haunted the world and good men longed for miracles, there towered upon a craggy cliff by a winter sea the rugged fortress of Camelot. (TRUMPETS PLAYING) Many years had passed since founding the Round Table. War had ceased and the land secured. The knights grew slack and settled, chivalry declined, and the ideals of knighthood fell into neglect. Only Gawain, a humble squire, prayed for knightly glory and adventure. King Arthur feared for his realm and as the old year waned, he summoned his knights to a feast. A feast he would make sure they would never forget. Take it away! Take it all away! I am not hungry. In fact, this whole feast turns my stomach. And so to speak God's truth, do you? Not yet! We have feasted too much of late years. We have quenched our knighthood with too many cups of wine. Therefore tonight not one crust of bread, not one mouthful of wine, until I know that the men I feast with are still deservant of the name of knight! (AWED GASPS) So rich a feast and yet an empty throne? You may have found a castle with its guards asleep, but not a court without a king. By this staff, great King, you may know I come in peace. All I seek is good sport. (SHOCKED GASPS) And the ax would suggest the sport. Single combat to the death? Ha ha. It is yuletide, and the old year is dying to make way for the new. I propose a game more in keeping with the season. Here is my ax. Feel it! Huh? (LAUGHS) It is a heavy instrument, but true, and for sharpness the East wind is not its equal. Sirs, I offer it to you. I shall kneel here with neck bare for any man who dares the deed to hack my head from off my shoulders. Come, take up the ax. There is no trick. I will not flinch away or seek to defend myself. I will kneel here ready for the blow. Uh... One blow and no more. All I ask is that afterwards I shall be allowed to return it in a like manner. (LAUGHS) It's a simple game. A cut for a cut. Is there no man among you who will play my game? What kind of court is this, hmm? Where is your pride? Your prowess? Your courage? I am waiting. My neck grows cold. If you are so firmly set on seeking folly, then by Heaven you shall find it. I will take the ax myself -and bestow the boon you claim of us. -My Liege. What are you doing, you young fool? My Liege, give me the game. Let the cut be mine. (COURT JEERING) Quiet! I will have quiet! A while since I doubted your right still to be called knights. Now, God help us all, I see there is no longer any room for doubt. Only one man in the court had the courage to take up the challenge. And since he is but a humble squire, let him come here. Arise a knight, Sir Gawain. Now the challenge is accepted. Young Gawain. You have but the one blow. Take care there is no chance afterwards of its being returned to you. Sir Knight, it may be too late after I have dealt my blow for you to tell us your name and your home. You know of me all you have need to know. Come. Let the game begin. (SHOCKED GASPS) I came to challenge a man, not a boy, and a sorry thing it would be to slay one so young. Because you are green and unschooled, and you humble those whose courage could not rise to my challenge, I give you another year's grace to grow your beard. Another twelve months of life to do with as you will, and if you choose to spend them seeking me and find me before the year is out, I give you leave to challenge me to any form of combat that you will. But, mark, when four seasons have passed and you find me not then I will claim my right to an undefended blow. Where will I know where to find you? If you do not find me I will send you guides and counselors signs and portents to set you on the right path. And this shall be a sign unto you the advent of green proclaims that I am at hand. Bright green is the mark of your deliverance. NARRATOR: Gawain resolved not to pass the year in idleness, but to set out at once with Humphrey, his squire, in quest of the Green Knight. Weapons, armor, horses, all had to be borrowed from the King, the loan to be redeemed only by the success of his mission. Failure would bring death. What adventure lay ahead? Could the supernatural power of the Green Knight be overcome from a beardless boy? Gawain left Camelot a green youth determined to return a man. Seldom resting, sparing neither horse or man, he searched from dawn till dusk. Stealthily, the seasons changed and the delicate hues of spring stirred the land deep in winter somnolence. Could the budding green of spring herald the hour of combat with his mysterious foe? Gawain hoped the time was surely near. GAWAIN: At last a sign. The Green Knight. Come on. Enter and be welcome. This is a trick. You need fear no treachery at my hands. GAWAIN: What then are the signs that I have been following? Patience, young hot blood. Here is a haven. Rest, and you will learn in time. I have no need to tarry, my way is clear. I have only to find the Green Knight. Sir Gawain, I know nothing of the signs that led you here. I know nothing of this knight you seek. Yet, in so strange a quest, no trail is too strange to follow. Young man, ride on. Let your horses' shadows fall behind you, but ride on still. At the sea's edge you will come upon the Grotto of the Green Stone. There you will find a spring, a chalice and a green stone. Take the water to the stone. (ETHEREAL VOICE): Gawain. Gawain. Gawain. Gawain. Gawain. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (GULLS CRYING) MAN: Young Knight! Young Knight, what have I done to you that you commit a crime against me? What does he mean? I am protector of this grotto. I beg your forgiveness. You have violated our sacred spring. I couldn't know the storm would come. By your evil act you have brought down the torrents of Heaven. I have no quarrel with you, sir. You have defiled the spring from which our land of Lyonesse draws sustenance. Get thee an arm! (HORSE WHINNYING) (GAWAIN CRYING OUT) NARRATOR: The goodly charger cantered on, a warrior's horse bearing faithfully to the end it's dying master. Gawain had inflicted a mortal wound. MAN: The Black Knight approaches. Open the gates. (ALL CLAMORING) NARRATOR: Black Knight, by grace of God, Lord of Lyonesse, protector of the Grotto of the Green Stone, was dead. His good wife, the Lady of Lyonesse, mourned the passing of her beloved spouse and vowed vengeance. Revenge. I will be revenged! We must search for the villain who slew my noble lord. My Lady, do not send forth your men-at-arms. There is no need to search for this man. How dare you even think of such a thing. He will come to us. (ALL CLAMORING) Please take this ring. Put it on your finger, and hide the stone in your hand. So long as you hide the stone it will hide you. It has magic powers to change all things, but beware not to drop it. As soon as the gates are opened, follow me. MAN 1: He's gone. MAN 2: He's gone. Disappeared. (ALL CLAMORING) You saved my life and I don't even know your name. I'm called Linet. Does it hurt very much? I must bind it. Sweet Linet, why are you doing this for me? I'm an enemy of your land. I know only that you needed my help, and that you need it still. It's just that it was as though you were expecting me. Yes, I was expecting you. -So you knew of my coming? -Yes. I have always known it. I have always known that once within these walls, you would be in sore peril of your life, and I must use my ring to save you. And then? Do you not know what land this is that you have entered? No. This is Lyonesse, the lost land of Lyonesse. Lost in the wilderness of past dreams and ages yet to come. (BELL TOLLING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) -The Kingdom mourns. -The Black Knight? Why? Why was he wearing a green plume? Green is the color of elfin kind. Spring's resurrection, the color of the dead. No other knight in this world carries that color on his crest. Then it was he. Three days ago, a knight dressed in green crossed the path of our protector and he, when challenged to fight, refused but paid tribute with one of his own green plumes. I told my master it would bring him ill fortune to wear it, and I was right. The Green Knight. I must find him. I must play out the game. Linet? Linet. -LADY LYONESSE: I will not listen. -LINET: Please hear me out. You have been hiding him. That's why he's not been found. -Admit it. -No, you don't understand... Yes. Yes. Treason, indeed. I'll have your head for this. Guards! Guards! I submit myself to your mercy for I am the knight you seek. You may withdraw. I meant no harm to your lord. I swear to God I was tricked into that killing, and I humbly beg your forgiveness. Mmm. Forgive me, child, I have misjudged your purpose. I see now that you sheltered this valiant knight from the highest of motives, the welfare of our land of Lyonesse. Who better to be the new defender of our spring. Come. I will call a meeting of the Royal Counsel and summon my bishops tonight. As soon as My Lord is given burial. Lady, forgive us for having broken into your mourning. Oh, why should I mourn? My late husband was a terrible man. From our marriage night he proved a most cruel tyrant. He bled the very people he should have protected. And what is more, far worse, he treated me like a hedgerow hag. No tenderness, no respect... No, I cannot speak of it. And the wenching and the drinking. Many is the morning I have buckled on his armor with my own hands because I was ashamed for his squires to see his sorry state. (CHUCKLES) You cannot know what I have suffered all these years, but now everything is changed. We have a true champion to defend the kingdom. And be my husband. What have I done? It was no fault of yours. I just wanted you to stay in Lyonesse. You truly wanted me to stay? Oh, Linet. And I've done you nothing but harm and now you've got to go, and quickly, -if you can win free of the castle. -I will not go without you. You cannot know what you are saying. There must be some way of escape. For you, but you must go alone. Do you not want to go with me? I do. Yes, you do. As I knew that one day you would come, as I knew that one day I would save you. GUARD: After them! (GROANS) (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) (GROANS) GUARD: Quickly, over there! Gawain. Gawain, take care! (GRUNTING) Gawain the ring will save you. (WIND HOWLING) Linet? Linet! Linet. Linet! (MEN CHANTING) (AWED GASPS) Peace. I come in peace. Where are you traveling? We are pilgrims, we have been traveling for many years, for all time, it seems, but our wandering continues. In your wanderings, did any one of you see a fair maiden wearing a ring in which is set a strange stone? No. No. Or the knight, garbed all in green. Green-haired and bearded with eyes of green fire and ice. Once seen one would never forget such a one. Indeed one would not, my son. Such vexing questions from one so young. Then what shall I do? Come with us, my son. I am bound by another quest. I must find my own way. NARRATOR: Bereft of his enchanting Linet, and with no comrade to cheer him, Gawain tramped the vagrant by-ways resolute upon his quest. Gray spring yielded to bleak summer, a summer of dust and drought. A glaring summer without solace for the valiant young knight. Come harvest time, tidings reached him that many leagues to the north there dwelt the wisest of wise men who favored garments trimmed with green. But some claimed he was the greatest of fools to sport the color of the elfin kind. Such dubious fame Gawain could only read as a portent of the Green Knight. Is anybody there? (CREAKING) Who is it? And whom do you come seeking? I come seeking the wise man. And you have found him. (LAUGHS) I said, and you have found him. You have been long on your journey, Sir Gawain. If you know so much of me, can you tell me where I can find the Green Knight whom I seek? The Green Knight? Aye, I know all about the Green Knight. I know of the challenge between you and I know that you will meet him at a green chapel when the time falls due. I, truly. I know all about that. (LAUGHS) At last! O wisest of wise men, can you tell me the road to this green chapel? (EXCLAIMS IN FRIGHT) That is a thing beyond my telling. But, you said... That I knew of your challenge and your meeting at the green chapel. One is a thing of the past, the other is yet to come. I know all things of the past and most things of the future, but what you ask me is of the present. And the present is the one thing in all the world of which I know absolutely nothing. But you said... When you come to think of it, perhaps that's why men call me the fool. Good day! (FLAMES BURSTING) GREEN KNIGHT: I will send you guides and counselors, signs and portents to set you on the right path. (PANTING) Lyonesse! LINET: This is Lyonesse. The lost land of Lyonesse. Lost in the wilderness of past dreams and ages yet to come. Humphrey? Whoa! Hey! (BOTH LAUGHING) -Hey! -Hey! Where have you been, eh? I searched for you. I tried to find you but you disappeared. NARRATOR: Linet pondered upon her strange dream of the Green Knight and the finding of the green sash. She was not aware that danger approached from the domain of the robber Baron Fortinbras. To the eyes of his devious Seneschal, and to Oswald, the Baron's scapegrace son, a defenseless maid was always a desirable conquest. (URGING HORSE) (LINET SCREAMING) Don't be a fool. Look, there are at least ten of them, maybe more nearby. Come on. Now! Are these knaves the best you could find? My Lord, these were the only ones who were fit enough. Then they'll have to do. (SHOUTING) Stand proud. For today you join the army of his most exalted Highness, the Baron Fortinbras. (SOLDIERS LAUGHING) (SOLDIERS SINGING) (SIGHING) (SOLDIERS LAUGHING) (LOUD THUD) You! You there! Don't you know how to use a sword better than that? No. Show me. You see, a sword is three foot of tempered steel, with death dancing at every inch and hanging like a dark star on the very point. You don't wield it like a broomstick, but so! (OSWALD GRUNTING) SENESCHAL: Your pupils learn quickly. No doubt due to your excellent teaching. I think perhaps it is time for an even sterner exercise. For the Pas d'Armes. That should show us what stuff our young warrior is made of. Hey, you! Young man, you must defend that position against any and all comers from this time until sunset. Take care you don't disappoint us. That's it, get him! (GROANING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (ALL APPLAUDING) (ALL CHEERING) (MAN GROANING) (ALL CHEERING) To the death. You dare defy me! What happy occasion have I interrupted? A combat to the death? My Lord, these men found guilty of gross insubordination to your high office. We decided, quite naturally, one must pay with his life. (LAUGHING) Well done, good Seneschal. Well done! Well, our bellies are howling with hunger after our long journey and death sits not easy on an empty stomach. (LAUGHS) First let us feast. And let these wretches join our feast. Let them eat their fill on this, their last day on Earth. And then the child declared he owed his loyalty to... Bertilak! And when I said I'd have his head for that, he fled! (LAUGHING) -Father, I want a word. -Not now, my boy. Later, my boy. Later. (SHOUTING) Let's have some entertainment. Hey! Bring on the fatted calves. (ALL CHEERING) Now! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) SOLDIER: My Lord! What? -My Lord! -What is it? Sir Bertilak and retinue are outside the gates. (ALL EXCLAIMING) SOLDIER: Sir Bertilak wishes parley with you. Let him enter. (ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY) (SILENCE) Ah! Sir Bertilak. We are indeed honored by such an august presence. I did not come here to dally with you. Your ceaseless raiding into my Western provinces must stop. From this day forward, my people must be safe. Your provinces? (CROCKERY SHATTERING) This land is mine! Then it is war. Sir Bertilak, perhaps another way may be found to settle our differences. Wars, after all, are such a clumsy way to settle anything. We can offer in exchange for this desolate swamp land, a prize which fortune has found fit to strew among our path. A treasure worth a dozen provinces. It is a maiden. So fair she would put even the silvery moon to shame. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GUARD LAUGHING) (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR SLAMMING) (METAL CLANGING) (GRUNTING) (METAL CLANGING) (GRUNTING) (SOLDIER GROANING) (SCREAMS) Humphrey! Here! (BREATHING HEAVILY) GAWAIN: Linet! Here! Linet. (DOOR OPENING) (STRUGGLING) Linet! Linet! Linet! (SCREAMING) (OSWALD SHOUTING) GAWAIN: Linet! (LINET SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) GAWAIN: (SHOUTING) Linet! (GRUNTING) (STRUGGLING) (LINET SCREAMING) GAWAIN: Linet! Linet! LINET: Gawain! GAWAIN: Linet! (STRUGGLING) Gawain. You must know I share your sorrow. (SIGHING) We must keep moving. They'll be looking for us everywhere. We must find some horses. And these clothes, they could easily recognize us. Gawain! Quickly, we must hurry! No, Humphrey, I can't. It's no good, I can't go on. Well, you just can't sit there and let them take you. I'd as soon. I've nothing to live for. Well, we'll find something later on, but for now it's enough to keep moving. Look, come on, man. Come to your senses! Oh, get off! For God's sake, get off! I'll go my own way. HUMPHREY: Gawain! NARRATOR: Now was his ordeal ever more arduous. Haunted by a nightmare of his fair enchantress consumed by flames, Gawain deserted the trail of the Green Knight and, in sore distress, roamed the desolate places without hope or aim. All that somber fall he wandered, half slain by autumn gales that bared the trees. Green leaves yellowed, turned russet brown. A sign to Gawain's fevered mind that his adversary also had abandoned the game. (PANTING) (CRYING) (CRYING) I hope to God there's someone here. (SOBBING) If there's anybody there, let me in. Please, God, in the name of charity, let me in! (GATE OPENING) GAWAIN: In the name of Christian charity let me in. PORTER: Patience! Patience! I'm coming. (SHOUTING) I'm coming. Is it you who was calling? What do you mean by disturbing a good man? Go on! Off with you. We have no truck with beggars in this court, no indeed. Good man, I am a knight, not a beggar. I have traveled very far. Take me to your master. You, a knight? (LAUGHS) Take you to my master? Let me tell you, he's not so comical minded as me. He just might not see the joke of it. I said take me... All right, all right. But let me warn you, whatever you are, if he finds himself not amused, oh, yes indeed, you will be the sorry one. Come on. In you go. They're only sleeping off a hard night's drinking. All's well. (CHUCKLING) (SNORING) Great Lord! I pray your pardon for disturbing you. I am Gawain. I am a knight and of a noble court, though I look more fitted for carrying a staff and a begging bowl. I have journeyed far, I am sick and sore in need of shelter. Open those shutters there. Young Knight, you shall have what you seek and you shall not leave here till you are made right well again. I bid you welcome, Sir Gawain. Prepare the finest chamber. Meantime, we will to the chapel. (MEN CHANTING) (BELLS TOLLING) (BELLS TOLLING) (BELLS TOLLING) Oh, Linet, it is you. I thought it was the fever. Oh, Linet! (SOBBING) I've... I've been looking for you for so long, so many places. I've dreamed of you so often and of having found you, waking always to that same emptiness of loss. Now, you're here. Oh, God is good. LINET: Yes. In his infinite mercy, he sent me a protector. Sir Bertilak brought me out of my captivity. He must have carried you away. That was not the way of it. He found me when I was in peril of my life... (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) LINET: Sir Bertilak could have done what he would with me, but he set me free. And he told me that I must stay or go as my heart bade me, and I thought that I had lost you for all time and Sir Bertilak was so kind and good. So, I chose to stay. I'll take you away. (DOOR OPENING) Aha! This makes good seeing. Linet must have tended you well for already the life is coming back into you. You're on the mend, soon you will be well again. Seems that your prayers have been answered. NARRATOR: Linet's affectionate care, and the healing herbs she gave him by the homely fireside, slowly mended Gawain's tortured health. LINET: Now you look like the Gawain I used to know. NARRATOR: Winter was upon them, but not for him the rough and ready yuletide pleasures. (HUNTING HORN BLOWING) NARRATOR: Let Sir Bertilak hunt wild boar, pursue the elusive fox, chase deer in frosted woods. Gawain would husband his strength for the hour of his deliverance or death from the Green Knight, was now but one day distant. Take anything you want of me. (GAWAIN SIGHING) If we were to kiss, our hearts would fly together and there would be no parting. Ever again. (WHISPERING) Please anything. And tomorrow, after I've gone, will not the sorrow be all the more harder for the both of us to bear? And you maybe only one day left for sorrow and I shall have many. Days and days to want you and long for you. I love you. I've always loved you. Gawain! I want to give you something. Take this sash, which I wear round my waist. Wear it tomorrow and no evil will befall you. Please take it. What magic can overcome the Green Knight? I will wear it as a token of our love, for the rest of my life. GAWAIN: I'm glad to see you, Humphrey. HUMPHREY: I was expecting you. GAWAIN: Were you? HUMPHREY: I heard the maiden was not dead and in Sir Bertilak's protection. I knew that one day you'd make your way to her. GAWAIN: Linet, go back. You know where I must ride. I ride with you. Young Knight, you have robbed us of the prize. (HORSES WHINNYING) (KNIGHT GRUNTING) (METAL CLANKING) GAWAIN: Ah! (GAWAIN GROANING) (STRUGGLING) (GAWAIN GROANING) (GRUNTING) You think you are the victor? You think that, but soon you shall meet my master. Baron Fortinbras will come. He will come, I tell you! (EXCLAIMING JOYFULLY) (SENESCHAL LAUGHING) (SCREAMING) (FORTINBRAS LAUGHING) (SWORDS CLANGING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (FORTINBRAS EXCLAIMS) -(GAWAIN GRUNTING) -(FORTINBRAS EXCLAIMS) Come on. Now, let no man say he can overcome you. And let no man say he can overcome me. I must go, Linet. Welcome to my dwelling. Kneel and make ready to receive your cut. What? You who think yourself afraid of no man, you who have conquered so many, do you now flinch at the ax? I did not flinch when you let fly your blow, but held as still as the grave. Yet, you tremble. Deal me my destiny. It was foolish to dream of glory and knighthood. I was a fool ever to play your game, now as I've played it, let us bring it to an end. Strike and be done. Strike! You've had your cut. The game is over. (LAUGHING) You tell me when my game is over? I make the rules. Come. Come. Stay your sword. The full circle of the year is turned. And just as every green shoot of spring returns to the earth, so return I. Live on, Sir Gawain. Live on. NARRATOR: Now Gawain understood the aim of his quest. He had prayed for knighthood and the nature gods had taken heed. Green Knight was sent to ripen his untutored youth and reveal to him, through trial and ordeal, the mystery of life. To each his seasons, to each his moments of defeat and glory, of loving and losing, of death and joyful rebirth. That his time on this Earth might be fulfilled with courage and the purity of heart that befits a man. Thus ends the tale of Gawain and the Green Knight.
