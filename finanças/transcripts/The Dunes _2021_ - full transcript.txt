Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Hello? Hey Nick, it's Emma calling from O'Brien Real Estate. - Hey Emma, how are you? - I'm good. I've got a little bit of bad news. The rent is now two months late. I went to do an inspection on the property. And? I'm not sure what to tell you, but we can't locate the tenant. Right, let me guess, he's trashed the place. That's actually the strange part. Everything's immaculate, it's perfectly clean. The cupboards, the fridge is empty. The furniture's exactly how it was when we moved the tenant in. Um, all right. Look, uh, I'm gonna have to talk to Ange and get back to you, okay? I'll call you if I hear anything further. Thanks, Emma. Hello, Mr. Rice. - How are you? - Very good. Where's Lilly? Uh, she's in bed. - She okay? - No, she's not feeling good today. Oh, what's wrong? I think she's getting a cold. - Where's Angela? - She stays with Lilly. Yeah? Okay. Everything good with you? Um, yeah, um, can I go early today? Okay. Is it for another audition? Yeah. How much early do you need to leave? In 30 minutes. All right, well just check with Mrs. Rice. I have already spoken to her, she said okay. Okay. Can you do something for me? Yeah, sure. Can you go to the liquor store and get a bottle of vodka? - Mkay. - Cool. And don't mention anything to Mrs. Rice, our secret. Okay, surprise. - Hey. - Hey, I thought I heard you come in. How was the interview? If I have to listen to one more lying politician, I'm gonna shoot myself in the face. Why don't you just start writing about movies or sports? How's Lilly? She's all right, although I had to pick her up from school again today. She got another cold. She'll be fine. Ah, and I got a call about your dad today from the retirement home again. What happened? He's had another fall but he's gonna be fine. How? Well apparently he tripped on a power cord vacuuming. I mean, there's no broken bones or anything- Fuckin' hell, what's he trying to vacuum for! He's gonna be fine. He's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right. I should be there with him. Nick? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine, just a bad dream. Oh my god, I'm so worried about you. Maybe you should go home for a little bit. Maybe you're right. Everything'll be okay. Yeah, it was funny. Oh, my boy's outside man, I gotta go. Whassup? You ready or what? Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. You got it, man. I could not let you take a Uber, all right? Besides, I may not see you again. - Ha. - Just messin'. Oh, you better be. You know me! How you been, girl? - Hi, Mike. - Yeah. Make sure you get him to the airport safely. And no pit stops, you guys. We won't, we won't. Have you got a hug for Uncle Mike? Hi, Uncle Mike! Oh, my little Power Ranger! - I'm not a Power Ranger. - Oh. - I'm a princess. - Course you are. Oh, is that a new bike over there? - Take care. - I will. I'll call you when I land. Listen, if I have to sell the house- Yeah, yeah. Just do what you have to do. Look after Lilly. Take care. All right, I'll call you when I land. See ya. Got a hug for me? Eeee!

Okay. - Gotta go. - All right- Let's do it. Come on, brother, let's go. Ah. See? It's the same stuff from the other night, man. It is good. Ah. This should put me on my ass, man. - I know. - Come on. I gotta spend my money on it. So how's your father, man? He's all right. - Yeah? - Yeah. Ange said he tripped over the vacuum cleaner cable. Mm, that's not good. Well at least I know where you get your clumsiness from. - Fuck- - It runs in the family. You're right. Runs in the family, man. Yeah, mate. So, uh, you gonna sell the house, for real? Yeah, I think I am. I can't up the mortgage on this place. Well, you know, it all work out in the end. Like you always tell me, stay positive, right? Yeah. Not gonna take my own advice. You should. You should. Hang on, actually I shouldn't be giving you any of this, you'll get arrested. You always had the crazy good stuff. Let's go, all right? All right. - Next stop, airport. - Let's do it. Oh, hi. Hey, what are you doing here? I told you I was coming. Where are your teeth? Oh, god, I better go and get them. Okay. - Sorry about that. - It's all right. That'll be right. Ruthless toothless. Okay. - How are you? - Better now I've got my teeth in. So, how are ya? Oh, your mum will be really pleased that you're back. Al, you're wanted. Somebody wants to see ya. Dad, I just saw her, uh, she was just going to the shops, she said she'll be back soon. Is Krista here? Uh, don't know. Don't know where she is. She's probably pinching my underpants. What do you mean? Well she is always pinching my pants. What, and she wears them? I don't know. Oh, God. 'Cause I can never find them. Nick, you made it. Yeah, just in the nick of time by the sound of it. He said you've been stealing his underpants again. Henry. You telling stories about me again? She steals them, then she brings them back. - Tea anybody? - Sure. So he still thinks you're a woman. Well, I'm a nurse, he's old. How's he been? He has good days and bad days. He thinks your mum's still alive. He's happy, though. Most guys with his condition are really angry, but he's been great. So, you staying up at the house? Yeah. Mmm. Cold? It's been alright. Has the weather been alright? How's everything been going? Uh, wet. - It's up this way, hey? - Yeah. Yeah, it's nice out here, though. Oh, look, rainbow! - Wow. - Pretty good, isn't it? I'm glad you moved here, Dad. All right. Which way should we go? Well, should we go and see the ducks? Yeah, sure. If you feed them. Have you been feeding the ducks? Absolutely. I never thought I'd see the day. No, they're, they're real little characters and they can fight. - Really? - They fight each other sometimes, sometimes they're very withdrawn. - Yeah. - But, uh, once they get going, they really sort of go in for the, the bits of toast. - Oh, you feed 'em bread? - Yeah. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, I'm a bit bummed that I can't stay a bit longer. Yeah, yeah. I was thinking maybe of extending my trip by a couple of days. You might have to. Yeah, no, it'd be nice. Have you eaten yet? - No. - Today? - No. - You've got to eat, Dad. - Oh, I haven't had time. - You've got to make time. You can't starve yourself. I'll see you soon, Dad. Drive carefully. - Hey. - Hey. How's everything going? I'm just with Lilly. She's been a bit of a handful today. Yeah? It's all right. Has the real estate agent located the tenant yet? - No, I don't think so. - Well, what did they say? I haven't spoken to them yet, I'm gonna give them a call in the morning. The place looks, you know, pretty good, the garden's a mess. - Hi Daddy! - Oh, hello, sweetheart. How are you? I'm good, but I have to go finish my video game, bye! Oh my goodness. All right, look, I've got some work to do and I'm pretty beat, so- All right, well take care and if ya need anything, let me know. And say hi to your dad for me. All right, night. Cheers. Bye. Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. I haven't seen you for a while. G'day, Misty. So how's things? Same old, same old. - How're the folks? - Good! Dad's a vegetarian now. - Get fucked. - Uh-huh. Really? Yep, doesn't drink, smoke. He had a triple bypass last year, so. That's great! I mean, not about the triple bypass, but that he's looking after himself. How's your dad? He's all right. He misses Mum. You still singing on the cruise ships? Yeah, it's good. I'm just helping out here, you know. This place has a way of sucking you back in. Yes, it does. Beccy still working here? She is. Yeah is she here? She knocked off half an hour ago, aren't you married? Well, de facto, but practically. We actually have a little three year old now. Well, I never thought I'd see that day, when you were a dad. You and me both. - So, what do you want? - Oh, uh, just a America no. Really? Right, yeah, I'll have, anyway, too long. A long black. Much better. - Kayla? - Yeah? Could you get a long black, please? You still at the Times? How's that goin'? Uh, it's all right. Has its ups and downs. I'd kill to live in LA. So it's just all these? That's cool, yeah. Thanks. No worries. You know what? Keep the change. Well, good to see you and say hi to Beccy for me. I will. You behave yourself. Hey, mate, how you going? So sorry to disturb you, but look, I've got some car issues. I, I dunno, um, I was spear fishing down at Diamond Bay. It's not starting, uh, I dunno if it's the battery or, or what but, I've got some jumper cables. Could you help me give it a start? Yeah, sure. Just lemme grab my keys. Good on ya, thanks. How long's it been sitting there? Good few hours, mate. Might've left one of the lights on and battery go dead. I'll meet you up there, mate. Ah, thanks, mate. Hey, uh, I'm Knighty, by the way. Oh, Nick. Nick Rice. Good to meet you, Rice. Yeah, you too. All right, do you wanna try and turn it over? Yeah, yep. Hey! Awesome. Ah. Beautiful. Watch out, mate, you might kill someone. Oh, not bad. Yeah. - All right, cool. - Thanks, buddy. Hey, do you mind if I just wash up inside real quick? Just while I let the car get some juice in it. Uh, sure. Mm. Oh, smells good. Ah. Mm. Are you right there? Sorry? What you, you want a bowl? I mean, you wouldn't mind, would ya? Sure. Plenty to go around. I've always got more noodles. Ah, look at this, thank you. Bon appetit. Yeah, so, um, so I never knew my real parents, 'cause, uh, I was adopted at birth. So I grew up in Cairns with my foster family. They ran this charter company that would take people out on the Great Barrier Reef. And it was, it was my job to look after the spear fishing tour. Oh, yeah? Love it. Love hunting. - Really? - Mm. What do you like about it? Just the thrill of the chase. Having something at your mercy, you know, being in control of another life. Wow. That's pretty fucked up, dude. Yeah, it is. Plus, fish are delicious. So. You know, there's that. Well, I can't argue with you there. They are pretty good. How long you been in Melbourne for? Few weeks. You staying near here? Yeah, not far. Just down to fish the coast. Have you ever been spear fishing? No. No, it's not really my thing. I don't like to kill. Mate, you gotta try it. When you're under the ocean, it's like you're in another world. You can kill whatever you want, and no one will know. Oh, I'm just messing with ya! Shit, you should see your face right now. Oh my god. You're too easy, man. Oh, what about you, mate? What about me? Oh, you know, what do you for a crust? Um, I'm actually a journalist, I work at the LA Times. LA Times LA Times? In LA? - Uh, yeah. - Oh ho ho, woo! Mr. Hot Shot. So what got you into writing? Uh, it's kind of a long story, actually. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. Um, when I was at high school, something happened to one of the students there. And, uh, I wrote a story on it. And, uh, the teacher liked it, they sent it to the local paper, it got published. And, uh, been writing ever since. What was the story? One of the students, he beat his parents to death with a cricket bat. And he went to jail. So it's because of you that that kid went to jail? No, he went to jail because he beat his parents to death with a cricket bat. Listen, mate, I've got a lot of work to do. - I should probably get back to- - Yeah, yeah. Oh, hey, hey. Just before I head off, there's just something I really wanna show you. So, just, just hang on a second. Oh, sorry, better flick off the car while I'm there right? Battery must be juiced! Where do you meet these people, Nick? You a whiskey man? Uh. I'm actually taking little bit of time off. Oh, mate, come on. Just have one with me. It's my way of saying thank you. It's really thoughtful, I'm sure you got a bunch of friends who can drink with you. Yeah, but who better than sharing with someone that's just helped me out in a time of need? Come on, I'm not taking no for an answer. Grab a couple of glasses. One drink, then I gotta get back to work. Yep, yep. Absolutely. Besides, how often to you get to have a drink with a famous writer? I'm hardly famous, but thank you. Here's cheers. To the generosity of strangers. Ah. Ah. How good is it with that dip? Getting like a, like an olive taste? - Mm. - It's olive-y, which is funny. - Olive-y. - Oh, it's olive dip. Okay. - What? - That. Oh. So, your wife, she, she sounds like a fucking great chick. She's good. Mmmm. Lucky boy. We're not actually married. Oh, sorry, ah. No, we fucking might as well be. But we never got married. - My parents- - What do you mean? Well, my parents were never married either, so I don't see the fucking point in it. Have you got a girlfriend? Uh, no, no? Why not, you should have one. I don't know, I just got down here. I reckon, like, see how the fishing goes for a bit. It's working out pretty good. I dunno, just too busy fishing here. Oh, you a poof? Just kidding just kidding. I dunno, do you know, maybe you could introduce me. Have you got someone you could introduce me to? These are good, by the way. Haven't fuckin' had one of these in- No, no, no, no. I'm driving. You reckon you'll go back up to Cairns? Oh! You've gotta with me sometime! It is so good! Really? - You love it, huh? - Yeah. What is it you like about it, anyway? I dunno, it's just freeing. Just you, ocean. Prey. I've had a long day. Oh, fuck. I gotta take a piss. Okay. Oh. You okay, mate? All good? All good? Yeah, I'm fucking right. Okay. Morning! What the fuck, what time is it? What are you still doing here, mate? Mate, we polished off half a bottle of Scotch each, I wasn't exactly gonna drive home, was I? Crashed on the couch, hope you don't mind! I see you made yourself at home, how was the shower? Ah yeah, not too bad. Your water pressure's a little weak. Now, hope you like pancakes. Listen, mate. I've gotta call my wife I've got a lot of work I've gotta to do today. Yeah, do you want some help? No. Ah, just kiddin', just kiddin'. Hope you, uh, are ready for a triple stack. Now do you want butter, we got that, we've got the lemon and the sugar and then whatever. It's your place, help yourself. - G'day, mate. - Hey, mate, how you going? What can I do for ya? Um, I just got back into town, um, my garden needs a little TLC, I don't suppose there's someone here that could give us a hand? Oh, yeah. Look, I've gotta tidy up around here. In about an hour, I can drop around, yeah? All right, great. Do you want me to give you my details? Just go in the office, leave your details with the girls. I'll see you shortly, yeah? All right, beautiful. - Thanks, mate. - See ya. So this is it, thank you so much for comin' past. Yeah, no worries. Can't neglect a garden in need. Yeah, well that's good, 'cause this garden is definitely in need. Yeah, it's all got pretty, uh, overgrown. - Aboriginal art. - Oh, yeah. - My cousin done that. - Really? No, dickhead. So, uh, anyway, what do you want me to do? Bit of weeding, tidying up? Yeah, I was thinking, just clean it up a bit and over here I thought maybe we should get some landscaping done along the back fence line. Is everything okay? What? What'd you wanna show me? Yeah I was just saying, I was thinking we should get some landscaping done along the fence line. You're gonna need more than landscaping. What do you mean? Bad energy. Ugh. Come on. Seriously, what happened in the house? Nothin'. My parents bought it when it was new, we've never had any problems here. Where's your parents now? Well, my mum died a couple years ago and we moved Dad to a retirement village. Did your mum die in the house? No, she died at The Dunes Hospital. Strange. Listen, mate, I, I just need to get the garden fixed so that I can sell the place. Can you do it or not? Look, I don't wanna upset you, mate. But I, I do things a little bit different. And I've been doing this for a while, and, this land, it's, it's, the energy I'm getting off it's really, it's bad, it's a dark energy. The landscaping, mate, that's no worries, but, but when it's done, I usually do a, a cleansing ceremony which is gum leaves, you smoke it, you know, you clean it out, it makes it nice, it brings in a good presence and a good balance. But I don't think it's gonna work here, mate. The land's broken. You can't fix broken land. Look, what I suggest is, you need to sell the property as it is, mate. You're back. Yeah, I, uh, forgot to get milk. I'll get you some milk. Nick? How are you, Beccy? Misty said you were back. Yeah, I just got in yesterday. You look good. You too. Listen, can I call you? Sure. Still on the same number? Yup. All right, uh, I'll call you. Don't. What the fuck. I've gotta be losin' my mind. Time for you to get off the piss, Nick. First day, starting right. Now. Hey. So anyway, things were just kind of escalating at work, um, Ange was pregnant, and I didn't really know how to deal with that. You know, I never thought I'd be a dad. And then I was trying to make up time and I was staying back at work later, and I, I couldn't really cope and started drinking a lot more than I should've. My editor started getting frustrated with me. Then Ange had the baby, and Ange got postnatal depression. And then there was more of this and it's kinda why I came back here. Just needed to get my shit together. You've always had your shit together, Nick. Yeah, I dunno. Maybe. Can I ask you something? Sure. Why'd you leave me the way you did? Yeah, I was expecting that. It's okay. Just asking. I was so in love with you. When I got the offer for the job at the Times and, and you didn't wanna move to America. And I didn't know how to finish things with you. So I just left. And I know it was childish and stupid and immature and, and I'm really, really sorry. That's pretty messed up. I'm really sorry. Well, here's to learning from our mistakes. Can you smell that? I was gonna say, I smelled something really awful before. God. It's probably just a possum under the house or something. It stinks! Thought I could smell something when I came in, I thought it was the sewage but- It's disgusting. - Wait, Nick. - What? What is that? Over there. What is that? Oh! Jesus Christ! Oh! Get inside. So, uh, you mean to tell us that you've been staying for two days with a corpse rotting in your garden. And you only just decided to tell us now? Maybe we should take Hollywood and his little girlfriend here down to the station. Guys, I, I just got in two days ago, I dunno what you're getting at. Clearly this body was dead for weeks. The property is in your name, right? Yeah, but I told you, I live in LA. And you got no idea who he is? No, my property manager handles this place. They have done for the last four years, that was the last time I was back here. We had a renter in for a bit but he skipped out. Sounds all very convenient, Mr. Rice. So you said your renter skipped out two weeks ago? Has it occurred to you that our friend in the bushes could be your renter? What the fuck would the renter be doing in the bushes! Miss, I'm gonna need you to calm down. Didn't you say your wife was in America? What? She's just a friend, she popped in for couple of t- An old friend who helps you find bodies in the bushes? I dunno what to tell ya. Well, I think we've got all what we need for the moment. Uh, O'Brian, do you have any more questions for these two lovebirds? No. I think I've got everything I need. Don't think about leaving town. We'll have more questions for the both of you. Are being interviewed as witnesses, now criminal suspect in an effort to establish- Krista? I'm hungry. Can you get me something to eat, do you think? Sure. That was one of the strangest things I've ever seen. So creeped out. That's not exactly what I was expecting to happen when we caught up. I don't think anyone's really expecting that. How do you think he died? I dunno. It's just so awful. Nothing like that really happens around here, you know? I don't think anything like that happens fuckin' anywhere. When do you think you'll go back? My flight's booked for Tuesday. Hmm. Why don't you stay a little longer? Hey. Hey. Uh, did you forget something? No, no. No, no. I just wanted to give this to you, something to say thank you for helping me out yesterday. Oh, mate, you shouldn't have. It's the least I could do. Well, I mean, I was just in the area, thought maybe you might like to have a, have a glass. Hey, I'm Knighty. Hi, Knighty, nice to meet you. Uh, this is the guy that I was telling you about. His car broke down out the front, he had a flat battery. From the Great Barrier Reef. Ah, you told her about me. I'm really flattered. Do you wanna come in? - I, look, I'm- - Yeah, sure, I mean, I wouldn't mind, as long as I'm not interrupting. You know what? Mate, I think we're gonna call it a night. - Ah. - No, I'd love to, I just- Am I interrupting a sleepover? No, no. No, it's nothing like that, it's just, it's been a long day. And it's been kinda stressful, and I just, - you know. - Really? Why, what happened? It's a long story, I just. I think we need to call it a night. Ah. Cool. As, as long as I wasn't intruding. No, no, no, um, Nick just has a lot of work to do tomorrow. Yeah, I- Well, if you want, I can walk you out. Mate, you know what? I actually, she's gonna stay here. I set up the spare room, you know, it's best not to drink and drive. Ah, yeah. Don't I know that. Hey, if it's, if it's easier, I could drive you. Um, I'm good to just crash here, I think, yeah. Right. Mum's the word, eh? Mate, it's not like... That was really weird. Yeah. I dunno, there's something off about that guy. So weird. I can't, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. If you change your mind, you know where to find me. Rice. Hey, man. Knighty, what are you doing here? I'm, I, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm know how, I know how this looks. I get it. Please just can we just have a quick chat? Why do you keep comin' around here- - I know. - You shouldn't be here. I know, I know. I know, and I get it. I know, I understand that this must seem very strange, but please. I'm sorry I keep barging in, and I, I, I understand, please just, I just really need to talk to you. Just a couple of minutes of your time, please. I'll give you two minutes and then you gotta go, mate- I'm gone. - This is not- - I'm gone. All right, then you gotta go. Yeah. Thank you. What is it? Why are you here? Look, I haven't been completely honest with you. We have met. We, well, we do know each other. At least, of each other. This is coming out of left field, I, I know this, but, go, go with me on this. Um, my parents, they used to abuse my brother. And it only started when he turned six. He lived through it for seven years. And then the night before I turned six, it was, it was nearly my turn, but he didn't wanna put me through that. So he took a cricket bat to my parents. Oh, Jesus. You're Jamie's little brother. Yeah. Finally. Yeah. You're finally starting to catch up. Mate. I haven't spoken to your brother in a long time. Why did you write that story? You know he was all I had. He told me that your dad was hitting him. He came up to me at school and he told me what he did to your parents, he told me that they hit him, he never told me about any other kind of abuse. That was it. I didn't know how to deal with it, I wrote a story, the teacher sent it to the, to the local paper and it got published, and the next thing I knew, your brother was in jail. I was a kid. I was 13 years old. - He trusted you- - Hey. I was 13 years old, he fucking beat your parents to death with a cricket bat. What was I supposed to do? How is he? He's dead. Topped himself in prison. - Knighty. - 'Cause of you. You did this. You did this. You did this! I didn't know that they were abusing him. I didn't want him to go to jail, I didn't want him to get abused! But he was off! It's not my fault. By the way, she didn't put up much of a fight, your little girlfriend in there. Hey. She is good in bed. She, I mean, you've probably, you probably know that. What the fuck are you talking about? I think, I think she thought that I was you. What the fuck did you do? Nothing. Nothing, nothing. Knighty, what have you done? What the fuck have you done? Excuse me. Can I help you? I'm not sure, uh, I'm here for the funeral of Nicholas Rice. The funeral was last Friday. How do you know Nick? Uh, we're old spear fishing buddies. - I take it your- - I'm his wife. Was. I'm Angela. Will. Will Knight. It's weird, Nick never told me that he fished. It's a beautiful funeral home. Yeah, it is. It's Nick's little brother had his service here, too. Brother? Didn't know Nick had a brother. Yeah, Nick's little brother died when he was young and, uh, Nick always blamed himself. Hey, this might be a bit forward, but would you mind if we grabbed some lunch together? I'd love to hear more about Nick when he was younger and, and hear about his brother. What do you say? My shout. Nick was about nine years old and, you know, his little brother was a few years younger. They were playing at this surf beach and I remember his mum was supposed to be looking after them, and then, she was such a wonderful woman. But she was a drunk. Nick told me that apparently she went to the car to get another bottle of wine and left Nick to look after his little brother and- Watch your brother. Nick got distracted and He was gone. Ocean had swept him away. Nick was never able to forgive himself. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
