JINNO At ten this evening, Genpei Hirukawa, the suspect in a case... involving the rape and murder of a school girl, escaped in Setagaya. He is a dangerous criminal with six convictions of rape and theft. Serves you right. Give me money. Damn you. Where is the safe? You wanna die? You won't die. You killed plenty in the military. I was exempt from the military. I was in the Tokyo University lab. Really? You were snug in your lab while I crawled in the mud in China? Where is the money? Bitch. You wanna blow me? Stop. What are you doing? You're nice and wet. Look, your wife has a real nice box. How is it? My wife was raped in my presence. My wife is from an aristocratic family. She is modest and polite... but I know she has a secret desire. "Degeneration' Forgive me. Come on. Gasp and crawl with joy again. Show me how ecstatic you can be. Like when you were being held by that killer. No, please. Don't hit me there. I am pregnant. - Pregnant? - Yes. Don't hit my belly. Is that so? Is it mine or that bastard's? Bitch. Degeneration.

You're acting like your mother more and more. Now then, what is it you wanted to tell me? I'd like to sell 300 square metres of my land in Nerima. Your land? What's the price? - About a million yen. - A million? The anniversary of my father's death is nearing. I want to repair our house before I hold the service for him. It's all I can do for him. I understand. Tatsuya, I believe you are twenty now? Yes. My birthday was the first of last month. Then legally, you can dispose of the land as you see fit. You don't need to consult with me. I suppose not. But I have no parents. You were a friend of my father's and I would like your advice. It's been two and a half years. Your father was always very careful. Still, he died in a storm. He tried to save me. He tied me to the cruiser's cabin so I wouldn't fall overboard. Then a wave caught him and... That's how a father and son should be. It was a miracle you came back alive. Brother, aren't you lonely? You live all alone in that big house. Live and overcome solitude. Then you'll obtain something strong. That's what father used to say. If you are so concerned, be his maid. No one else will employ you. Even after you graduate from university, they still won't. A maid? I don't mind. But I cost half a million. - Prepare yourself, brother. - Expensive maid. A million yen. The idiot was surprised when it was only a million. I still have three billion and 900 million left. And it's all mine. Mine. Tatsuya, this is not a garden. How many times must I tell you, you brat? Darling, forgive him. Please. Stand aside. I'll teach him a lesson. Stand up, damn you. What's that look? Don't look at your father like that. Tatsuya, apologise. Those eyes, they are his. They are the eyes of a killer. I want to open a shop in Ginza. I know. Hey, professor. She's watching us. Piss on her. Professor, I'm going crazy. Look. I have been writing this diary, fired by hatred. But I have nothing more to write, because my hatred is gone. I know it. Tatsuya's youth, intelligence, modesty and mild manners... all remind me of my late wife. I have started to like him. I believe all men are originally good. On his 17th birthday, I will stop writing in this diary. Two and a half years have passed. My real way of life is about to begin. The great men who created Auschwitz and dropped the A-bombs... those who massacre, they are the strongest. They are peaceful now, and wear masks to hide their brutality. I will show them who they really are. Saeko. Saeko. - Who are you? - My name is Tatsuya Jinno. It's been two and a half years. I am glad you remember your promise. Well, I hope you have kept your promise to me... that this is strictly between us. What's the sense in telling people about my affair with your old man? - Hell, they know what I do. - I'm glad to hear it. Now, what will I get out of it? - Not a yen. - What? I'm getting rid of you. You're in the way. Tatsuya, you... put something in the brandy. Blood will tell. - It's my first time with a woman. - I'm honoured, kid. Untie me. You're a bad boy. Let's quit the bullshit. - Whore. - What? You dirty pig. You let father lay you in front of my mother. - Blame your father. Not me. - He was not my father. My mother was raped by a killer. I was the result. His name is Genpei Hirukawa. He is my father. You always were strange. But another man raised you. He sent you to college and left you a big wad of dough. What? What the hell is that for? From now on, my life will be like that of my real father. When my mother killed herself, the professor bribed the doctor... to make it look like an illness. They are all phoneys. Last evening my father scolded me. He was in a bad mood? He said I may have grown up physically but not mentally. He said I must stop calling you 'brother'. Why aren't you going out to sea tomorrow? - To sea? - You do that often, right? - Do what? - Squint. When you are thinking about something. - Is that so? - You're doing it again. Yumiko, my birthday party is tomorrow. A birthday party? Great. Congratulations. Congratulations. - Congratulations, Tatsuya. - What did you call me? I will call you Tatsuya from now on. - If that's okay, brother. - You said it again. Is she his fianc?e? She is pretty. I hear she is Miyahara's daughter. Tatsuya made many college girls cry for him. There is one of his victims. I'll get the old wine while they are listening. I have a perfect alibi for tonight. "Naked Body found by Tama River Ginza Bar Hostess killed" The winners of the Speech Contest were at the Shibuya Public Hall. Next, we'll hear Miss Kiyomi Nishizaki with her winning speech. Miss Nishizaki is a senior from Akita High School for Girls. Confidence in the human race? What we human beings need is confidence in other humans. In parents, brothers, sisters, wives, husbands, even strangers. Some say the history of human beings is the history of wars. People kill each other as if driven by a strange force. It is insane. Only when people rid themselves of that force... will they have true confidence, and love for peace. We could not get any fingerprints, but the semen we found is type AB. My hunch was right. I thought of him when I saw her. Murder and sex. Genpei Hirukawa. The guy who got away, just when you had him. I will never forget it. It was on a rainy day. This would be his fourth victim. I'll get him this time. Somebody, help. Stop. "University professor involved in accident." "Son miraculously returns alive." Tatsuya... I have been meaning to ask you. Why are you always reading that paper? Don't you think this guy's son looks like me? A professor's son looking like a killer? You must be nuts. AKITA SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL FOR GlRLS - Are you Kiyomi Ishizaka? - Yes. My name is Asahina. I'm from the Asahi Newspaper. I thought you'd be a homely girl who studies all the time. I am surprised you are so pretty. I came with Fuyuko Kamisaka. The critic from Tokyo. I want you to do an interview with her. Come on, get in. Miss Kamisaka? I hope I can do it. She won't bite. Come on. Your picture will be in the newspapers. You are awake? - Who are you? - Your coach. I brought you here to draw out the immorality in you. Where am I? Let me go. Please, let me go. You are a virgin, aren't you? Why are you doing this? Let me go home. I had a good look at you while you were asleep. You stink. You don't wash yourself often, do you? But you masturbate a lot, right? Your clitoris is swollen and dark red. Do you know ?Histoire d'O?? Beast. Untie me. Spare me. Please. Swear to be my slave. When did you start masturbating? When I was in ninth grade. Did you do it while writing your speech? Well? Show me. Why do you treat me like this? Then die. Stop. If I do it, will you let me go? If I can take a good look. Do it. Do it. Forgive me. I'm ashamed. Don't look. Destroy their bodies, crush their spirits, ruin their hearts. There are innumerable records of cruelty caused by war. Such as the dropping of the A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki... and the massacre of the Jews by the Nazis. The occupation of Poland was special... because they planned to destroy Poland as a nation. Hitler named this annililation plan 'Operation Night and Fog'. On September 1, 1939 the Nazis started WWII by invading Poland. They began a systematic liquidation of the Polish people... at Auschwitz, the largest factory of death the world has ever known. Their motto was: 'Crush their bodies, their spirits, and their hearts.' And the Nazis made Jews wear the Star of David on their chest. On the one hand, Auschwitz was an example of the cruelty of man... and on the other, a study of the extent to which man can degenerate. We are lucky to have been born in a time of peace. If I had been a Jew back then... The very thought makes me shudder. Don't you think so? While you were listening, you thought of the victims? - You mean you thought of the Nazis? - Actually, yes. You once said that what you hated most was power. - I still do. - I don't understand. There is something I hate even more. The masses. Since that day, 'Night and Fog' has been my bible. I was cursed with life. I needed to get even. Forgive me. I won't ask you to let me go anymore. I'll do whatever you say. - I am keeping a bird. - Really, what kind? It is lovely, but it doesn't obey me. Birds are difficult. They take patience. Yesterday it finally became friendlier. Is it cute? I see. What about keeping me? - Wouldn't you like to live with me? - Yes. But you are not easy to tame. - I disagree. Hit me if I don't obey. - Could I? Sure. But you are too gentle. Sometimes it scares me. - Do you go to church? - Not recently. I go every week. You are a bad boy. Really. You can tell from a woman's nose what kind of pussy she has. Flat noses are no good. Hooked noses are worse. - Judge women by their noses? - Yes. If the nose turns up, she has a tight pussy, like a mouse's ear. Tight? When I'm in the Turkish bath tonight, I'd better go for a turned-up nose. I laid a nun in Nagasaki once. She was nice. Probably a half-breed. With fair skin and brown hair around her snatch. - How could you tell in the dark? - I looked when it was light. Don't drive so recklessly. Don't worry. I'll buy you a flat- nosed whore once we're in Kawasaki. Any nose will do. Flat or hooked. As long as they can be laid. Old man, I am Momotaro Hoshi. You taught me a lot tonight. Studying is what counts in life. I am lucky to have met you. Look. It's Jun Yashioji. Step aside. No autographs. Out of the way. Tatsuya, are you all right? A superficial peace, a counterfeit culture. TV is a collective hypnotic machine... to procure flocks of sheep without the will to resist. She thinks she's important because she's riding the tide of popularity. She'll soon find out she's just an animal. - You like that song? - Yes. They want to take it out of the national texts. I liked it when I heard you singing it. Me? While I was asleep in the cage. You were sitting there and singing. I pretended to sleep, but I was listening. Tears welled up. My hatred for you faded away, like the water at low tide. What's that? What are you doing? I am worried about school. I am not good at math. Why? Show me. These two... fill this in... Look. Wonderful. Are you a university student? Where are we? Is this Akita city? We're in a place you don't know. Here, eat something. - You have become prettier. - You think so? Really? You can treat me rough. Do I still stink? I washed myself well in the shower. What are you? Your slave. Pig. Yes, I am a lecherous pig. I have seen 'Histoire d'O'. What do you call it in Akita? - What do I call what? - Pussy. - I'm embarrassed to say it. - Say it. - Mamo... - Louder. - Mamo. - Louder. Mamo. Please... Want to go home? No. Let me stay. Harder. More. We're in Hamatsu. I will check in. Welcome. Here you are. Miss Yashioji? There is a message for you. Thanks. "I will send a car at eight. Kurihara." You're going out? - Yes. Don't tell her manager. - You can trust me. Please. Are you from Reiji? Hurry, please. It was smart of Reiji to use Kurihara. His real name. That's why the clerk didn't know. The more famous we become, the more they forget our real names. That's the price of glory. Where are we going? Who are you? Did Reiji send you? Machiko... Let me go. Kiyomi Nishizaki, the missing high school senior... was found wandering at Numazu. She just wanted to get away. She seems to be another victim... of the university entrance exams system. Her parents are happy she has returned safely. Hi, Yumiko. When are you leaving Karuizawa? Tomorrow. You have to go to school as well, right? Vacation is over. I'm leaving this evening. - Shall we go for a ride, Tatsuya? - Why not. - Let's go. - Come on. - Want to go back? - No. What do you think about me? I love you. Take me. You... in my heart... I wish I could tear out your heart, and look at it. I wish I could, too. I'll show you something. There may be something dark in my heart. Machiko, how many days has it been? What about my TV shows? I am with you. Don't despair. You're the only person I rely on. I know. I will protect you. No matter what. Why must I disappear for love? You are crazy. Murderer. You were dropped from the New Year's show. Who the hell are you? What do you want? - I am a fan. Don't you remember? - Why should I? I have thousands of fans. So you're a star. You must have used this a million times. If you rape me I will bite off my tongue. Will you? I think you will be begging me to screw you. You are much nicer. Take a shower. No. Don't. Are you a virgin? There was an American sailor in Okinawa. If you obey me, I may spare you. Am I really nicer than her? Sure. Gasp louder so she can hear. Yumiko. Hello. I am on my way home from a tea ceremony with my aunt. - Can I come in? - Please do. I am sorry about the other day. I was surprised I could be so eccentric. - You are like that since childhood. - The way you talk. It seems I have always been selfish towards you. Remember in grade school when we both lost our way? - Yes. I cried. - I carried you on my back. We went along that dark road. But I was not scared. I felt secure with my face against your back. Don't be selfish anymore. May I see your bird? I let it go. I am keeping two others now. - Where are they? - I'm training them. - I can't show them to you. - How mean. You only love birds. Why didn't you scratch him? I am sorry. Don't forget you are nothing but my aide. That beast. Hot news. Your song disppeared from the charts. Machiko... Stand up. Look at me. Who are you? - Yashioji. - Jun Yashioji? - Who's that? - A singer. Then sing. Sing. You are terrible. You're no singer. Just a dark pig. Say it. I am a dark pig. - I am... - A dark pig. It is your turn, Machiko. Make her say it. Say it. - What are you doing? - I am a dark pig. You really are a dark pig. Who do you think you are? Give me a tissue, my powder puff. Get me a coke. You snot. Say it. I am a dark pig. I am... dark pig. Louder. I am a lecherous dark pig. I am a lecherous dark pig. Look up. I am a lecherous dark pig. This is the article. Hirukawa said this guy's his son. His name is Tatsuya Jinno. Want to check him out? That's a private matter. Just go after Hirukawa. Shit. I hope I will get into university. Kiyomi, you became so much prettier since your trip. Your math has improved as well. You'll pass easily. Just throw out your books and take a trip. I want to get married soon. That's a secret. Don't spill. Hold me in front of the pig. It excites me when she is watching. Please, help. I caught her. Somebody you have been keeping. - Who are you? - Don't you know? I've been observing you. You are like me when I was your age. It is in your blood. Father. We meet at last. I am so grateful. I knew you were my son. I thought you would feed me leftovers and let me stay in the dog house. I don't know how to thank you. Tell me what to do. I will clean the toilet. Anything. I am still healthy. He killed her in his usual way. He used butter. - What does that mean? - He didn't do it in the flophouse. The victim has been identified. It's Machiko Sugimura. She's that missing singer's assistant. What do we know about Jun Yashioji? It's Jun Yashioji. Tatsuya. You are going too far out. Are you crazy? Turn back. I have been waiting for this day. Just the two of us together. - Is man originally good, Mr Jinno? - Tatsuya. - I have read your diary. - Don't do this to your father. I am not your son. I am a killer's son. I love him more than you. I love a man who has the balls to stand up against God. Tatsuya, all men are originally good. We can only live by believing. "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me." Psalm of David. You told me to read it. I risked my life against the sea for this. If I survive I'll pick my own way of life. Tatsuya. Why the beard? What makes you think it's me? Your disguise doesn't fool anybody. I'd know you behind any mask. - A mask? - Sure. I kept my promise. I left a letter for my dad saying I'd be away for a few days. Now take me. Anywhere you like. You are squinting again. Yumiko, there is a world I want you to see. I've created it for you. I am glad. Ever since I was a child I have longed to see your world. - The day has finally arrived. - That's right. It has. - Tatsuya, show me your birds. - Unfortunately, they both died. What a pity. This time I won't let it die. The beautiful bird I've always wanted. You mean you have another one? Come. I will show you. I didn't know you had this room. Where is the bird? There. Which one will win? The God in you or the devil in me? Let me out. Why did you lock me up? - Calm down. I'll let you out. - Don't you trust me? She is cute. Are you keeping her for yourself? Pass her around. - Meet my father. - Your father? I am proud of him. Be patient, dad. Stay put a little longer. I'll show you something. Tatsuya, what are you doing? Brother. Why me? You are too pure. I'll give you a little Star of David. Now, water. What's wrong? What's troubling you? Please. Let me go to the toilet. Do it where you are. No. Let me go to a toilet. Tatsuya, let her piss at least. Brother, the toilet... please. Please, the toilet... Tatsuya, let me do it. Tatsuya. Tatsuya. Help, Tatsuya. "Lord, you are the one who returns evil for good." What's that? "Lord, you are the one who returns evil for good." - "May you give us light." - Stop that. Stop that. Stop. Stop. That mouth talks differently. Stop. Bitch. I feel sorry for you, brother. My heart aches when I think about you. I see my mother in you. You see only me. Just me. And I love you. Dear Tatsuya, forgive me for leaving you like this. It is against God's will for me to kill myself. But I betrayed him long ago. During the summer, in eleventh grade... I began a relationship with my father. Although feeling guilty, I stepped into the world of carnal pleasure... instructed by my father. I always hoped to marry you, but I knew it would never happen. Strangely, I felt closer to you when I entered your world of immorality. Was it instinct? Or was it the original sin? Even before you gave it to me, I wore the Star of David, invisibly. Tatsuya, do me one last favour. I killed Hirukawa. Then I chose to kill myself. They will believe it is your semen inside me. It's the same type as his. Your father, who loved you, would admit it is his. I will be on a journey with him. Goodbye, brother. "As long as we hate God, Who keeps silent..." 'He will continue living in our minds."
