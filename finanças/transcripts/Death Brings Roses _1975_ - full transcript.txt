[Chuck sighs] - You know damn well you're supposed to have that money ready and waiting for me at the bar when I come in. - But then I wouldn't get to see you. - Look, I got a lotta stops to make.

You should know the routine by now. - Don't they throw you a bone if you're late? How 'bout a beer? - Nah, next week. - [Man] Aw hell, man, you know he's not supposed to drink while he's working. - Aw, thanks, Pops. I'll remember that. - You call what he does work? You're outta your mind. - Well, well, well. If it isn't Charles the Famous. What are you doing here this evening? - [Chuck] I have a message for Max I'd like him to have as soon as possible. - Max is in the main dining room with a friend. Do you want to go to him? - [Chuck] Oh, no, no. Could you just send someone maybe to tell him that I'm here? - Of course. Susan, put down the phone. Go and tell Max that his man wants to see him immediately. - Yes, madame, right away. [soft music] Excuse me, missus. Mr. Max? - Yes? - There's someone outside. I think he's your associate. - Oh, damn. Thank you. - Hurry back, Max. You know the main course is coming, and I don't want it to get cold. - Please excuse me, Janice. You know I'll be back just as soon as possible. Yes, Chuck? What is it now? - I thought you should see this right away. - Don't worry about it. I'll handle it. Go on, do what you were doing. Madame. - Just one more inmate in a bust-out joint. - Come on, lay off. I think he's kinda cute. Kinda makes me itch. - The kinda itch like you always got? That you can't scratch? - You're two of my favorite bust-out ladies, so don't push your luck. - Bust-out ladies? Hell, I thought they were hookers. What does a bust-out lady do that's different? - In those beer-drinking joints on Bourbon Street, the doorman entices you in. If the girls inside see you have any ready cash at all, the only way you'll get out with it is if you bust out, so they call 'em bust-out joints. Hooking's only a side line. B-drinking and dancing? It's a way of life. - Sounds like one of Max's expressions. - I think it's an old carnie term. - What'll it be? Looks like you've been at it pretty hard. - What are you having? - Pearl. Beer of the Texas darlings. - [chuckles] Okay. Give me one of the same. - All right, who's buying? - I'll shoot you for it. - Hell, if you shoot for it we'll be here all night. - Not all night. I go to work in an hour. [drunk slurring incoherently] - Hey, you got a tab. You got a tab. [drunk slurring] Just pay it back first. - You got him. Hell, kick him! [Fred grunts] - Fred's in trouble. - Hey! Hey! [barfly groans] Son of a bitch! - [Chuck] The cops! - [Fred] Good work, fellas. That was right on time. - What you want to do with him? - [Fred] I just want my money from these guys. - Okay. Let's go. Let's go. [siren wails] [tires screech] - [Dispatcher] 21, 52 your office, re your 909. [sirens wailing] 21. USL 21. [siren wails] - Deja vu, huh? - Yeah? More like instant replay. When I saw you swing at that old baldheaded man with that cue stick, I thought it was Covington, Kentucky all over again. - Yeah, that fight with the pool hustlers? I got the same flash. That's why I lowered the blow to the neck instead of the head. Yeah, I remember it well. - Yeah? Well, I remember that newspaper headline: "Two suspects wanted for manslaughter." - Suspects? Hell, that was us. You're right. Instant replay. - Listen, you gotta learn to control that temper of yours. We got lucky this time. We walked away from that. Next time we might not be so fortunate. Listen, I gotta go check in with Max, all right? - I'll see ya. - Good morning, honey. How ya doin'? - I'm doing just great. How 'bout you? - Wonderful. Can't complain. By the way, Max wants to see you this morning. Max? Chuck's here. Yeah, I know. All right. - Thanks, sweetie. - You know, I'm still waiting for a call, honey. - Aw, sweetie. You're too nice to me. - Ha. - Hello, Chuck. How's it been going this week? - Nothing unusual. I made all the normal pickups. Everybody's totally paid up. The only problem I'm having is with those broads over at the Mardi Gras Lounge. - I have been waiting, and I've been patient long enough with those people. I want you to go there tonight and collect all of our back monies. That's four weeks' worth of commissions from those ladies. Here are the new contracts. Make sure they sign them. - Yes, sir. Take care of it right away. - And do it very efficiently, I hope! - Absolutely. Anything else you want me to take care of? - Yes. I want you come here early tomorrow. Say about 10. I have something very important to talk to you about. - Nothing wrong, I hope. - [chuckles] Nothing that won't keep until tomorrow. [upbeat disco music] - So you got yourself another live one, huh, baby? - Hello, Sid. I'm having a little trouble collecting the commission from those girls that we sent you. - I hear that. But I knew you'd be by to take care of things. Listen, I don't have to say it, but I want you to know without asking. Without Max, I can't get any decent girls in here. I don't think 10% is asking too much. - Well, I'm glad you feel that way. Do you mind if I have a little talk with the girls in their back room? - I wouldn't have it any other way. - We don't want what you're sellin', so why don't you get the hell outta here? - You seem to think that you got a choice. [girl yelps] - Wait a minute. - [screams] What do you think you're doing? - The contract is up. If you want the money you'll have to take it. - Okay, Patti. If that's the way you want it. [Patti yelps] - You son of a bitch! - Wait a minute! Okay, okay! We'll sign the contract. - And sign the contract right now! Come on. Get up. - Come on. - Just happen to have it right here. Sign it. Come on. [clapping] Hurry up. Sign it right there. - Hear they had a little change of heart back there. - I persuaded them to see it my way. While I'm here I'd like to pick up the money that you owe Max. - Oh, I anticipated something like that. I've got it right here. Sam? I've got it right here. Here you go. Paid till next Friday. - Business as usual. - You got it. - Thank you very much, Sid. - Okay, Chuck. I'll see you next week, huh? [bell rings] - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Hi, Laura. I see it's closing time again, huh? Why don't you come have a drink with me? - I'm sorry, Chuck, but I've worked so hard and I'm very tired. - Aw, come on now, Laura. Nice cool drink on a hot afternoon. Be just what you need. - Okay, maybe just one. - Okay. Lets' go. [soft music] - Hi. Can I get you folks a drink? - Yes, I'll have a Rum and Coke. - Jack Daniels and Coke for me. - All right. - Thanks. You don't really care for me, do you? You just kinda tolerate me. - It's not you. It's the work that you do. Mr. Tough Guy. What is that? That's not you, Chuck. Why don't you make something of your life? - Why is it that you don't like what I do? - It's Max. He has his fingers in everyone's pie, including yours. - Look, I don't know anything about Max's affairs. The only thing I know is he pays me, I respect him, and I trust him. - So you like to live in a mystery world, huh? One minute you're in the cloud, and the next second you're on the spot. - Honey, I don't see what this has to do with you and I. - Oh, really? Well, that's just great. Goodnight. - No. Laura, wait a minute. Laura! Laura! Laura, wait a minute! I'm sorry! Jesus. - $10, please. - Thanks. - Hello, love. You look lonely tonight. - So? What's it to you? - I've been waiting for you for a long time. When are you gonna tell me that you're ready for me? - I'm ready. How about right now? - That's wonderful. You are in for the treat of your life. Come on, let's go. [entrancing music] [sultry funk music] ♪ I was made for love ♪ Oh, I need your love ♪ I was made for you ♪ I was made for love ♪ Oh, I was made, I was made for love, yeah ♪ ♪ Nobody but you ♪ I was made for love ♪ Oh, I need, I need to love - [sighs] Chuck. You really have a problem. You don't make love. You... You just have sex. - Why do you say that? This was your idea. - If I would've turned a trick, at least I would've gotten something out of it. Money, anyway. When you make love it's like going to the toilet. No emotion, no feeling, no nothing. - Okay, okay! Shut up! I'm leaving. - No matter what the hell you say, I'm not gonna send you any people. That's right. No people. No strippers, no mixers, no musicians, no stand-up comics, no nothing. Unless I receive in cash... That's right. Cash. The $4,200 that you owe me from the past week. If I get it this afternoon, your people will be on their way tonight to make your show. If I don't get the money this afternoon, my people will be on their way to break up your place. Hi, Chuck. Done all the things I asked you to do? - I got every cent that they owed us, plus all those girls signed the new contracts. They didn't want to give me the money at first, but I was very persuasive. It's all right there. - Yes, I know. Sit down, Chuck. It's always there. Always. That's why I got you here so early today. You've been with me now, let's see, uh... Over two years. Two years, and you never stole one nickel. How much am I paying you now? - 425 a week. Plus my car and my credit cards and all my expenses. - From now on, that's all going to change. From now on, it's gonna be you and me, baby, 50-50. - 50-50? You mean we're gonna split half and half? - That's right. You're gonna be a full partner. Right down the middle. - Oh my god. You gotta be kidding me! - Chuck, you've been like a son to me, as well as a trusted friend. That's all a man really needs in a partner. So from now on, it's us. - You know there isn't anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, Max. - Well, here, you can start with that. Take it. I'm gonna arrange a weekly door for you for a thousand bucks, and anything else we'll split up at the end of the month. And you'll have to go out, get somebody on the street to make the collections. You're gonna be in the office here with me. In other words, you're gonna be replaced. - In other words, you mean I gotta find someone to do my job. And if he steals anything it comes out of my end, huh? - You catch on real quick. Son. [Chuck laughs] - Partners? - Partners. [lively piano music] - How you doing tonight, tough guy? - Well, I haven't evicted any widows or orphans yet. - Yes, but you would if Max told you to. As a matter of fact, you'd do anything Max told you. Or would you? - Girl, when I was a kid, I used to believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy and good over bad. And then I found out that you got very few friends. People who you trust and respect, and people who trust you. And Max is my friend. Just like you, honey. [lively piano music] - Oh, you're up bright and early. What's the new suit? New look? What's the big occasion? - Just got promoted. I'm a rich man overnight. I'm Max's partner now. - You're kiddin'. How did you do that? You, uh, find a body? - Remember when we first came here? We said that if we ever made anything, we'd take the other one along? - Okay, I'll keep my word. I make 200 a week. You wash the dishes, we'll split it 50-50. - No. Look, I'm serious. You think you could straighten up? Maybe work every day? Maybe, uh, become a man of means? - What, leave this fun-packed job and my loving boss to go work in a theatrical agency? When do I start? - Right now. Soon as you tell this guy you're leaving. - Okay. I'm gonna tell this guy where he can stick this job. - No, now look. Do it legitimately. Nicely. Call him over here now and let's tell him. - Hey, Mr. Anderson. Can you come here a minute? - Now what the hell's the matter? - Mr. Anderson? I want to hire away your bartender here and take him to work with Max and myself. - When do you want him? - Right now, soon as possible. - How 'bout tomorrow? Let him finish his shift. - Okay. - This is great for you. Don't blow it. - Don't you think it's about time? - Well, now that you've got your name out on the sign, I guess you want me to call you "boss." - Aw, hell. I couldn't answer to anything but "honey" from you. Lots of happiness to you both. - Well, we're gonna give it one hell of a try. - And you can go to hell too! Now, this is the way it's gonna be. Chuck and I are partners, and you are our new star employee. You've got the most important job in the company. It's gonna be your job to make sure that everybody gets to work on time, straight, not drunk, not high on anything, and they do their job. And then you go out and collect, both from the clients and the employees. - And if any cash ends up missing, it comes out of my pocket. - Okay, okay. I got the picture. You can depend on me. - So you two have been together all this time? - Yeah, through thick and thin. - And I may add, my years were a little thinner than Chuck's. - You stuck together after that big fight at the gambling house in Kentucky? The way I got it, there was a crooked card game. There was a fight. A man was killed by accident. There were two warrants out on these two guys. Here's a little present for you two. Now you can stop worrying. You can stop looking over your shoulders. - You son of a bitch. You knew all along. - I have friends, Chuck. I have a lot of friends and I demand respect from people in high places. I traded off. Your forgiveness... For some favors, for what they want badly. - What can I say? Uh... Thank you, Max. I really appreciate it. - Oh no, Al. You're not gonna get off that easily. You owe me. And remember, when the time comes for me to collect, you owe me. Now go on to work. My partner and I are going to have lunch. [crowd chattering] - Would you like to buy some flowers, sir? - Yes, I would, but I just don't know which kind to buy. - Who are they for? - For a lady friend of mine. A very special friend. Do you have any roses by any chance? - Well, roses are for complete commitment. I'd suggest a lover's bouquet. - Okay. Is that enough? - That'll do. [knock at door] - Laura, it's Chuck. I need to talk to you. - We've already discussed everything, Chuck. - Everything's changed. Look, you said you wanted honesty. Well, I'm here to be honest. Now... Can I come in, please? - Those are nice. Okay, but not for long. I think I'll put these into water, Chuck. - Okay. - Al and I got into a lot of trouble. - Well, let's sit down. - We got in a fight in Kentucky, and we accidentally killed a man. I don't know how it happened. It... It all just happened so fast. We got in a fight with this guy and before I knew what was happening, he was dead. - So what does that have to do with me? - Well, it's finished now. Max made me his partner. While he was checking into my background, he found out about it. And he fixed it. He got rid of my police record. - So no wonder you've been running around, hiding. Chuck, I'm sorry. I didn't realize. - I'm gonna change. I know you think I'm no good, but I'm really gonna change. Laura, I gotta make you understand how I feel about you. How I really, honestly feel. I want you like I've never wanted anyone before. [sentimental music] [birds singing] Laura, I want you to meet my best friend in the whole world and my old traveling partner. You're never gonna believe this, Al, but this is the girl I've been waiting my whole life for. - Well, I didn't think this day would ever come. Looks like the big search finally paid off. - Thank God. I was getting tired of looking. - Does this mean that you're really gonna tie the knot, or you just want to borrow my apartment again? - Oh, no. We're both very serious. This is the real thing. - That's the way it is. - Before I run down and buy some rice, how 'bout a little celebration with some champagne, huh? On me. Hey, Susie! Your best champagne. - This must be a special occasion. - Their new love. Our new freedom. - Well, this is a toast for the three of us. Al, I know that we're going to be very good friends, and two, because Chuck and I are engaged to be married. - I'll drink to that. - All for one and one for all. - To loyalty. [soft music] [birds singing] - Max! You son of a bitch. I've got something for you. [Max groans] [siren wails] [siren wails] - What? Can't believe that. No, no, no, don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Yeah, I'll take care of it right away. All right. Baby. Gotta get ahold of Chuck. Tell him that Max has just been killed in front of his place. Do it now. - Okay. Chuck, I've been looking for you all over. Sid sent me. Something terrible's happened. Max has been shot in front of the office. - No! You gotta be kidding me! - I'm not kidding. He was killed this morning. - I don't believe it. Thanks for telling me. Gotta go, see you. - Hello. - Well, well. What can I do for you gentlemen? - Well, that's your first mistake. We're the police. - I knew that. I was just trying to be nice. - [chuckles] We're looking for Chuck Watts. - Well, you don't have to wait long. He should be coming through the door any minute. [door opens] - You Charles Watts? - Yeah. I'm Chuck Watts. Who wants to know? - Well, I'm Sergeant Hebert, and this is my boss, Lieutenant Harrigan, NOPD. - Is there somewhere we can go talk? - I prefer to talk right here. - Have it your way. We found your boss, uh, your partner, shot to death out in front of the office this morning. - Do you know why? Or... Who would want to do that? - Well, that's why we wanted to talk to you. - We found instructions on the body and we called a lawyer. The lawyer took the body to the crematorium a couple hours ago. - We don't know who or what for. All we know is that he was shot at close range with a large-caliber pistol. I think it was a hit. - I don't think so. Too haphazard. Pro wouldn't have done it that way. You don't know much about Max, but you're fixin' to learn a whole lot real quick. - And I don't know whether you had anything to do with this, but I am gonna find out. When I do, I'll let you know, okay? Just don't leave town. - Your girl's got my name and number. Call me if you hear anything. Okay? - I'm Chuck Watts. - Ron Levy. Have a seat, Mr. Watts. - Thank you. - Well, we finally meet. My father, now deceased, and Max were close friends and were associates. Max was a very thorough man and there were provisions made in the event of his death. This sealed envelope contains the information to Max's estate, and that's all I know. - That's all you know, huh? - That's all I want to know. - Were you the one who had Max's body cremated? - That was Max's wish. - I see. - Good luck. - Well, thank you. [foghorn bellows] - Good morning. Nice to finally meet you. - Get on with it. - Well, my people are interested in Max, your former employer. Partner. Ah, pity about poor Max. Well, we're very interested in the information he acquired over the years, and we understand, fortunate young man, that you have accumulated this. We are interested in your cooperation. - And just who are you and your people? - Well, on the other side of the ocean, they're the law. Interpol. - So what? - Well, I've been instructed to ask for your cooperation in limiting the traffic in this commodity. - What exactly do you want from me? - Well, the information. I understand you are having a lot of other offers, and we'd like to enter the bidding. Perhaps more gently. And of course, there would be compensations. - That's the fifth offer of compensation I've had, so I'll just think about it. - Oh, please do. But not for too long. Time is of the essence. - We know what you have. I am to make you a cash offer, a partnership arrangement, for the information and services you can supply us. - I'm not supplying you with a goddamn thing. - Maybe you'd better reconsider. Your life depends on it. - As far as I'm concerned, you can take your offer and shove it up your ass. - I can have you killed any time. Maybe I'll show you. - Go get stuffed. All right, send them in. - You know why we're here. - I know who you are. Please sit down. - I'm Forbes, with the FBI. Agent Crawford. We've been told by Mr. Levy that you're the sole heir of all of Mr. Max's worldly possessions. - Yes, that's true. - I think we should read you your rights. - I know my rights. Just quit beating around the bush and tell me what it is you want. - We've also been informed that you're unaware of the kind of operation he's been running from this city. We've been after him for 15 years. - Somewhat unsuccessfully, I see. - That's not funny. - Look, I don't know what you're talking about and I don't give a damn. I'm not guilty of anything. I haven't done anything wrong. - Either you cooperate with us, or the big family. You know who the big family is. - Yeah, the mafia. But I don't know anyone or anything in it. - You think about it. It's time for you to pick and choose. If you pick their side, you lose. Because we'll keep after you forever, and we won't stop until we get you. - I don't think we have anything left to talk about. - Hi, Chuck. - Hello, Pam. How are you? Listen, is Ted here? - Yes, he is. Right this way, please. Ted? - Hey, Mr. Watts. - Hello, Ted. Is Madame Germaine here? - Yes sir, she is. - I'd like to talk to her for a minute. Think she has some time? - For you, sir, she always has a minute. - Good. Could you bring her over here, please? - Hello, hello, hello, hello! What are you here for tonight? Have you come for some food or some of my brilliant conversation? - I know that I don't have to tell you about what happened to Max. - No, no. Well, let's don't talk about that. It's too sad. - Look, I need your help. - My help? - I know that Max used to come in here with a blond girl. A singer, I think. - Oh, yes. Yes, yes, they used to come in here very often. Why? - Well, I need to find that girl and I know that you can help me do it. - Well, I don't think I could... Yes. Yes, perhaps I can. She works at The Inn on Bourbon Street. - Inn on Bourbon Street? - Yes. Do you know it? - Listen, thank you. You've been a big help to me. - Oh, come on. Don't thank me. I haven't done anything. - Bye-bye. - Goodbye. ♪ One of these mornings ♪ You're gonna rise up singing ♪ With Daddy and Mammy ♪ Standing by [audience applauds] - Hey, I'm busy right now. - Look, Janice. I know that you're aware of Max's death. - Of course. Everybody knows that Max is dead. Killed. But as far as I'm concerned, the past is dead. I don't want to be involved in it. - Okay. If that's the way you feel about it. Let's get outta here. - So where was your last gig, baby? - Well, I did a little work in Vegas, but you know how hot things can get over there. - Yeah, tell me about it. It gets like that around here. Oh, look who's here. - I want to see Chuck. - Well, he was here a minute ago. - I brought this file so you can see what Max has been up to. At least what we're very sure he's been doing. Goes back 20 years. Includes smuggling, hijacking, white slavery, kidnapping. - I don't want to see it and I don't want to know about it. - The reason we haven't been able to catch him is because he hasn't used money. No money. He trades people. Women for narcotics. There's no money transferred. No payout. - Look, I told you I don't want anything to do with any of it, so why don't you both just get out of here? - All right, we'll go, but I want to warn you, not just the big family, but every two-bit chiseler, every junkie, every petty thief is gonna be looking for you because they want the information that Max left with you. In other words, every two-bit cheap-shot artist is gonna want a piece of you, and you're gonna need friends. And give me a call. I'll be waiting. I want you to stick to Chuck Watts like glue. Where he goes, you go. I don't want to find him with a bellyful of bullets like Max. And I don't want one of these punks around here catching him by himself and squeezing the late Max's information out of him. You got that? - Yes, sir. - Well, things seem to be accelerating. My people are getting somewhat concerned. How about a thatched cottage, a numbered Swiss bank account, and staying alive? - Who the hell's that? - This is one more bidder in our domino pile. - Well, we could always make it a cottage for three. We're quite broad-minded. - Cottage for three? - Well, it's better than a coffin for three. - I'm afraid we're not ready for either one, thank you. We need more time. - Well, not too much. You haven't too much of that left. [smooth jazz music] - You wanted to know when he came in? There he is. - Come on and I'll introduce you now. - Hold it. Where are we going? - Just two tables away. I've told him you're coming. - Don Vincenzo. - Eh? Oh. - I want you to meet Chuck Watts. - Oh, Chuck. Hello. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - What you say we go outside, talk a little business, you and me, huh? Okay? - Okay. - Good. Go ahead, after you, after you. Sit down, sit down. You know, Chuck, that Max, he thought a lot of you. Took care of you. Left you a lot of things. Central American organization. All the Italians, you know? Far Eastern imports. It's pretty good. That's a good business. You know, Max and me, you know, we were partners. - Look. I gotta make you understand something. I knew nothing about any of this. - No kiddin'? You know, Max... He and I, we had kind of an understanding. You know, business. For keeping quiet and maybe for a few little services. We used to lay 55 grand a week on Max. That's right. Every week, son. Cash. - And now you want to make the same kind of a deal with me? Is that it? - Well, me make a deal with you... [laughs] Let me put it this way. When I was a young man like you, you know, I had no choice. You couldn't quit if you wanted to quit. Now, you know, it's different nowadays. Times change. Nice young man like you, Max liked you... I tell you what. I got a proposition. If you want to by my partner, stick around, you'll do all right, fine. If not... Well, we can work something out. A nice figure for you. You walk away, no problem. - Well, now look, Don- - Now you listen to me, son. You listen. Before you make up your mind. It's a hard business. We have strong competition. Ruthless competition. These people, they'll do anything to get their way. Young man like you, they'll kill you. Means nothing to them. Nothing. - I just can't believe it. Just when I thought all my troubles were over, looks like they're just beginning. - Yeah, well, you think about it, you know? We talk again another day. - Look, Don Vincenzo. No offense. I don't want any part of this business. I figure I'm better out of it. - You know, Max was right about you. You're a good boy. I got an idea. You know that... My theory, I call it. For a man to be happy, all he needs is a good woman. Eh, maybe enough money he can live comfortable. That's all. Some people don't think that. They need more, more, more. That's a good boy. Look, you think about it, take your time. You know, sleep on it. You call me, we talk again. Huh? - Okay. - That's a good boy. Hey, you want a drink? - Sure, why not? - Man, come on. - Good evening, Mr. Watts. - Good evening, Madame Germaine. - I understand you've been leading a very eventful and rather frightening life. - Yes, unfortunately, Madame Germaine, that's true. I came here because I badly need some advice. - Advice? You need advice? [laughs] He wants advice. - Excuse me, please. I can see this is not meant for my ears. I'll be back in just a moment. - Don't hurry. Now, I love, love giving advice, but I hate taking advice. But I'll give you some advice, and good advice. Get out. Get out as soon as you can. You think you've got friends? You haven't got friends. They're all bad men. Get out, get out, get out, as soon as you can, before it's too late. - Listen, I'm not scared of those people. I'm not gonna just pick up and run away. - I don't see why not. After all, discretion has always been a talent of all survivors. - That's very good. Who said that? - [laughs] I did. - Good evening. - Henny, uh... You know, I've been investigating your agent, Max. - What about him? If I knew anything I wouldn't tell you. I don't talk to cops. - Aw, man. Cool it, Henny. After all, let's just have a drink. [phone rings] - All right, all right, what do you got? I'm not interested in his personal life, you idiot. I just want you to follow him, see if he can lead you to Max's files and/or his source of information. Does he have Max's information yet? Well, don't think too much. You might rupture yourself. - Well, I guess there's nothing more I can do here. - Guess not. Five bucks, please. Boss will never miss it. Well. How 'bout a drink? - Yeah, I would like a beer. - You know something, kid? I've had my eye and ear at every keyhole in town and I come up empty. Nobody's talkin'. Nobody knows nothin'. - Well, you tried. I appreciate that. - You got it. - Forget about the beer. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait. You almost forgot your money. - Yeah, you're right. I almost did. - Meathead. - Man, times sure have changed. - Nah, nothin's changed. Players are still the same. It's only the winners that are different, that's all. - Nice to see you again, although I'm afraid it may be for the last time. Do you have a decision for us? - I think we'll go this one alone. - Pity. It's going to be dangerous. And, I'm afraid, permanent. Ah, well. Cheerio. [foghorn bellows] [steamboat chugging] - Hey, Mr. Watts. You remember me? - Yeah. I remember you. - Did you get my message? I sent it to you by car. - You son of a bitch! - Temper, temper! - My answer's the same: get lost. - You won't live to regret this. - All right now, here's the file. St. Charles Church over in St. Mary's Parish. Now, we sent them five musicians, couple of local TV personalities, and some miscellaneous acts. Now, the whole thing was over this weekend. So now what you gotta do is go down there and pick up the money. - Collect? What do I do? - Well, you go down there and you see Father Ryan, who's the parish priest. He'll pay you all in cash and all in small bills. Now, you gotta do this today because he doesn't like to keep that money in the rectory. - Well, how much does he owe? - 7,500. The total take was 181,000 and our cut was for the entertainment. [Al laughs] - Well, I've never collected money from a priest before. - [laughs] Jesus. - I mean, I don't even know where St. Mary's Church is let alone go down and talk to a priest. And look, it's such a good day outside. Why don't we forget this, take the rest of the day off, and go for a little ride down the bayou, huh? Give you a chance to get away from all these guys hitting on you. - For old time's sake, huh? Just you and me? Little ride in the country? Okay, let's do it. Listen, tell Laura that I'm gonna see her after work, about, 5:30 or so. [engine revving] [upbeat music] Looks like we got someone very interested in what we're doing. In other words, I think we're being followed. [tires screech] [truck honks] And you said it was a nice morning for a drive, huh? [engine revs] [tires screeching] Shit! [tires screech] - [Al] Hey, watch out! Here comes another one from the other side! Dammit, look out! Whoa! [Chuck and Al laughing] You like that one? [phone rings] - Who was involved? Oh, good. Maybe you'll get a medal. And I hope you're enjoying yourself as a spectator. Look, the only time I want to hear from you is when you've got some information, so just leave him alone for now and maybe they'll lead you to what we're looking for. - I found him. I rousted every son of a bitch in the French Quarter and I found him there with all the answers. - Fantastic! Who is he? Where do we find him? - Oh, he's some pimp disc jockey named Mike, working in an afternoon disco. Here's there now so we gotta move fast. - Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go. [upbeat disco music] - Hey, Mike! Hey, you got some information and we need a few answers. - Man, screw you. - Okay, you nickel-and-dime asshole. Who killed Max? Who killed him? - Talk! - His name is Bill Edwards. He was a partner of Max. He works for Dixie Brewery. He lives on Bank Street. - I guess you know why I'm here. I always settle my debts on time, mister. - Yeah, I've been expecting you. But before you use that, let me tell you why. Max took away the only thing I ever had. My little girl. He got her on dope and now she's dead. So go ahead and use it, I don't care. I've got nothing to live for anyway. [pensive music] - Nice-looking place, isn't it? It's kinda like what you see is not all that you get. - I don't see anything here but an apartment. - Well, whether you see it or not, I can assure you it's here. Now let me show you. - You're never gonna believe who I found in these files. In this one is the name of every narcotics dealer in Central and South America. And in this file is the listing of all the people who buy and sell Caucasian women in the Far East. And in this one is a listing of every mafia don in this country. [Laura chuckles] - This reminds me of a J. Edgar Hoover dream house. - Dream? It's a nightmare! I mean, this is like a tomb of Andrew Max's. You know something? I can almost feel him sitting here right now. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's this? Looks like a safe combination. - Combination? Let me see that. What do you say we give it a try, huh? [dial clicking] [Laura laughs] - I can't believe that! Look! Look! Look at all this money! - You did it. - I mean... [laughs] Look at this money! From every country of the world! They've got money! - Yes, I wonder what he had to do to get it too. - Hey, who the hell cares? It's money and it's ours. - That's right! All we gotta do is pick it up and carry it away! - Let me get the empty suitcases, boys. - Look at this money! [Chuck laughs] - I don't believe it. - Load it up. - Well, we are set for the rest of our lives. - Why don't you two go into business with the don? You know, 20,000 a week, that's better than a million a year. - Oh, no. It's filthy, dirty, and I don't want any part of it. - We don't want any of that mafia money. That's trash. - Well, it may be all you can get, because I'm taking this. - What the hell are you talking about? [pensive music] - I want it. I want the money. You know what this means to me? You know what this is? This is everything. This is power. This is position. This is everything I've ever wanted. This is my ticket out of here. This is trips to Switzerland, Chalais. This is it. This is everything I wanted and I'm taking it. - Al, we've been friends a long time. This money's for all of us. It's not gonna go down that way, buddy. - Chuck. You don't understand. I want the money. - Well, you're not gonna get it. [gun cocks] - Chuck, I want the money. - You son of a bitch. You're crazy! [gunshot pops] - What have I done? Oh my god, what have I done? - It's all right, sweetie, it's all right. Calm down. I'll call the don, he'll help us out. It's all over now. - I'm sorry. - Just calm down now. Oh god, we really need help now. Shh. Take it easy, take it easy. - What are we gonna do? - Shh. It's all right. Don Vincenzo? - Hey. Chucky. What's going on, huh? Why the big decision all of a sudden? - I gotta talk to you. - So talk. - You told me that no one ever gave you the chance to get out. Well, I want out. I just want to be left alone, understand? - [chuckles] I understand, believe me. Felt that way myself many times. All right. What's the proposition? - I'll give you everything. All the records, all the information, all the facts, everything. But the girl and I are out. You leave us alone. - All right. You got a deal. But why, huh? What happened? - Best friend I had in the world is dead because of me. Or maybe he just died of his own greed. His body is lying in there with the records. There are the keys. I want you to take care of all the arrangements and, uh... Dispose of his body. - I see. Greed, yeah. That's the weakness of man, all right. Tell you something, kid, though. Never mistake weakness for kindness. Now you listen. If you'd have hit that old man who got Max, would've been no way out for you. But you're lucky. You get a pass. All right, you keep the money and leave everything else. Now go on, beat it before I change my mind. - I don't know how to thank- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Buona fortuna, kid. [birds singing] - And in the words of Alexander Graham Bell, who said to his wife in bed on his wedding night: "What do you mean my three minutes are up?" [audience laughs] I love this town tonight. Folks, hang around. I gotta get outta here now. I gotta go and I have to meet my grandson, who's 25. Complains about headaches. Headaches! I've told him a hundred times when you jump out of bed, it's feet first! [audience laughs] He was so ugly when he was born, the doctor slapped his mother. [audience laughs] I just came from a pleasure trip. Took my mother-in-law to the airport. [audience laughs] My mother-in-law was in the Olympics. She was a javelin catcher. [audience laughs] Take my wife, please! I take my wife everywhere, but she finds her way home. [audience laughs] I said to my wife, "Where do you want to go for your anniversary?" She said, "I want to go somewhere I've never been before." I said, "Try the kitchen." There's a new Polish jigsaw puzzle. One piece. [violin squeaks] That's it. - Applaud! [audience applauds] - You ever see a Polish guy whistle for a cab? "Taxi." [audience applauds] Folks, I was sitting around with Brod Crawford. You know, we all sit around sometimes and we jam, and everybody wants to do a picture. And I sat with about five guys, Red Buttons, Milton Berle, Jan Murray, and Brod Crawford, and we said to each other, "What would you like to do if you made a movie?" and here's what I came up with. Now, I want to do a bunch of scenes, fast scenes, like I did in "Laugh-In" years ago. Now, in the first scene you see a priest. They send him up to Alaska. He's there for one year. Nobody hears from the priest. Now, the Bishop goes up to see him. He says, "How do you like it here in Alaska?" He says, "If it wasn't for my rosary and two martinis a day, you can have this place. Bishop, would you like a martini?" He says yes. "Rosary, get the bishop a martini." [audience laughs] Now, in the next scene, I'm sitting in a bar, having a drink on a stool. Over here's a man on a stool, having a drink. He falls down three times, I pick him up each time. "Bartender, where does this man live? I'll give him a lift home." He tells me where he lives, I grab the guy, pull him out to the car, open the back door, put him in, he falls down. I get to the address, I pull him out again, he falls down three more times on the way to the house. I pick him up each time. I knock on the door. "Mrs. Phillips, I brought your husband home." She says, "Where's the wheelchair?" [audience applauds] - Look, the next time you work here, bring a whole fiddle, not a half a one. - Look, boss, I tell the jokes here. [laughs] I like that suit, that style's coming back. Very nice. Where am I booked next week, my agent, my brilliant agent? - My dear friend Henny, you've been great. - Yeah, beginner's luck. Anyway, where am I going? Don't book me in that joint in Patterson anymore. He booked me in a place, I don't want to say business was bad, the doorman got locked up for loitering. Some guy asked for change for $20, they made him a partner. Oh, was that place tough. A guy walked up to me, he said, "I bet you $10 you're dead." Would you believe it, I was afraid to bet him? The checkroom girl's name was Dominic. All right, boss. We're going out to dinner, huh? - Who's gonna pick up the check? - [Henny] As usual, I pick up the tab. - All right, you got a deal. - Last time you picked up a check, it changed hands three times. - Oh, you two fight about it. Let me outta here now. - Well, what do you say? - I got you booked all the way up and down the line. Keep doing great. - Get me a little money this time. - Take it easy. [melancholic folk music] - Here's my favorite customer. Good morning, sir. - Oh no, not sir. Just call me Chuck. - Flowers this morning, sir? - Today I need something very, very special. Something's that got some meaning behind it, you know? - Ah, a communication for lovers. Roses. Red roses. They say everything. - How much are they? - $40, thank you. - Okay, $40. 40. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - All right. - Good morning, sweetie. - Oh, good morning. - What's going on today? - Everything. You've got a couple of messages, Chuck. - Hello, ladies. Everybody hang tight. I'll be with you in just a minute. - Is it possible I could see Chuck, if he's not too busy? - He's not too busy for you. - [Chuck] Everything's gonna be just the same as before Max's death. Nothing's gonna change. - Thank you, Chuck. - Could you take this in the other office and Milton with take care of you? - [Dancer] Okay, thank you. - I have something for you. - Do you? They're beautiful. - There are a lot of important things I gotta tell you. - I know, Chuck. I know. - But how do you know what I'm gonna tell you? - Because you never gave me roses.
