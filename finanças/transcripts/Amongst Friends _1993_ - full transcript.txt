[LIGHTER FLICKS] [WATER BOILING] [EXHALES] ADULT ANDY: When I was 12, I screwed this 20-year-old. I forget her name. She told me it was great, but it was too short, didn't last long enough. She was right, it didn't last, but nothing ever does. At least not long enough to make any sense of it. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] ADULT ANDY: There were three of us, me, Trevor and, Billy. Best friends from what seemed like birth. Came kindergarten, we were already working the master plans, Trevor and Billy'd fake a fight, candy-store owner would rush in to break it up and before he knew what hit him I'd be down the block with two cartons of baseball cards and the give-a-penny-take-a-penny jar. We didn't need to steal. We were experimenting. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] ADULT ANDY: We grew up on the suburban south shore of Long Island, the Five Towns. Crunchied-out granola-heads in Beemers and 944's. You got judges living next to gangsters next to rabbis living next to dentists. Sixteen-year-old Jewish kids thinking and acting like they're Flavor Flay. The only thing they all had in common was money, lots of money. Our parents knew what they wanted for us, but we had everything already. We saw things differently. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] ADULT ANDY: My grandfather'd sit around and tell us stories about the old days, stories about men who knew how to live. I guess that was the idea. My grandfather was a bookie to send my dad to law school. And my dad made money so that I could do whatever I wanted, and although me, Trevor, and Billy ever wanted to do was be like my grandfather. We were ashamed at how easy we had it. We felt spoiled. We felt like pussies. We were 13 and we wanted respect. ♪ I wish I could've seen you ♪ ♪ And you could run wild ADULT ANDY: I enjoyed a good fight, but I was more of an idea man.

BILLY: Good. Where's your brother at? I think he's in the back. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: Hey. ADULT ANDY: We were still hitting high school parties even after we graduated. Everyone we knew left. College. I could've gone, but I was comfortable. Besides, Trevor and Billy were sticking around. We still had plans. So we set up a business with some friends in Far Rock and just sort of lingered. There had to be a boss, Billy was it. -He loved the business. -BILLY: Okay, so which one of you guys going to do this thing, huh? Look at the look on your face, you look like you're worried about it. It's an easy drop, you just go, you do it, and you know, you know. You've done it before, it's no big deal. Yeah, but why ain't you doing it? BILLY: 'Cause if I could do it, I just told you, I would do it. But I don't have the time, I gotta be like a thousand places. I already told you this. -If you don't want to do it-- -Yo, Bill, man, I'll do it. -It's no big deal. -BILLY: You wanna do it? It's quick man. It's an easy deal. -Only one of you guys can go. -ANDY: No, no, wait a second. You asked me to do it, I can do it. Right? I can do it, I can do it, all right? It's no problem. I can't do this thing, all right, man? What do you mean you can't do it? I can't do it, all right? Billy said only one person could go. I got the girl in there. Where am I going to put her, huh, under my car? I mean, I can't do it. Dude, forget about the girl. -You're lying to me. -Nah, I ain't lying to you. -I told you I can't do-- -You're scared. C'mon, do I look like I'm scared, man? -Yeah, you do. -I look like I'm scared? -Yes. -No, I'm not scared. It's just last time I did this, man, the guys from Queens, they shoved a piece in my mouth for 15 minutes. I can't do this man. I still remember. You pissed all over yourself. Yeah, I know I did. I mean, you'd do the same thing if you were in my situation, man. -I mean, I can't do it. -It's cool, it's cool, -it's cool, relax. -I'm bugging out over this, man. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] I should hit you. Yeah, well, if I could do it, I'd do it but I can't. I should hit you. Gimme the keys, I'll fucking do it. It's all right? Yeah. It's all right. [KEYS JINGLING] ANDY: I owe you, man. TREVOR: Yeah, you do owe me one. -Hi. -How you doing? -Good. How are you? -Good. -Where's your parents? -They're not here. C'mon, let's go inside. Hmm, I'd love to, believe me, -but I can't. -What do you mean you can't? You're supposed to come over here. I gotta go do something. It's going to take me about a half hour, hour tops. I promise. ADULT ANDY: Trevor wasn't that big on the business. He could've gone away to school, but he stayed to hang out with Laura. She was still in high school. She was a good girl, I liked her, had a lot of heart. But still, I didn't get it. They were serious, too serious. All right, I'm gonna go. I'll be back in a little while, all right? All right, gimme a kiss. Go inside. I'll talk to you later, all right? I'll see you in half an hour. Get that sad face off. MAN: So, where's this kid Bill? I thought he was coming. You know Billy, he's busy, he's got things to do. You're dealing with me. So you got something for us, right? Don't tell me we drove here for nothing. Hey guys, relax, all right? You guys are with me. Everything is cool. You a cop? -Huh? -Who me? Yeah, I am. You wanna see my badge? C'mon, stop fuckin' around. What do you think? Think he's all right? Yeah, he's all right. Yeah, I trust him. Hey, you got smoke? Yeah, I got the smoke. You got the cash? Yeah, I got cash. Open it up. All right. It's in there. C'mon. ADULT ANDY: It was an easy drop. I really would've gone and done it myself, but I had to stay with the girl. Besides, Trevor was happy to do me the favor. And I'd owe him one. It's cold, huh? TREVOR: Very cold. C'mon, don't fuck around. [LOCK PICKING] TREVOR: Fuck you. There you go. Yeah, that's it. -Fuck! -You're under arrest, scumbag! [SIRENS BLARING] Yeah, your life's over, faggot. How's that feel? You're gonna need your lawyer. Detective, help me get this bag of shit up. Make sure somebody tosses a gun on the fucking car. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SIREN BLARING] ADULT ANDY: The trial was like a popularity contest. All of a sudden, Trevor had a thousand best friends. People were talking about a set-up. Billy felt bad, it could've been him. I knew it wasn't a set-up 'cause it should've been me. Judge made an example of him. Even his father's cash didn't make a difference. The kid was going away. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] LAURA: Come with me. TREVOR: No. Please? No. [CHUCKLES] -C'mon. -No, this is your education, baby, not mine, all right? Oh, like you don't need an education. No, I don't. You want to know why? 'Cause I get mine right here on the streets, that's why. Oh,, yeah! Right here on the killer streets of Hewlett Harbor. Hey, relax, all right? Beats fuckin' college. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] ADULT ANDY: A couple weeks after he was sentenced, I went up with Laura to see him and he refused the visits. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] ADULT ANDY: Two years went by and Trevor should've been out. Where was he? Fuck it, it didn't make any sense. But hey, it's nobody's fault. Just people start moving in different directions. Back home, me and Billy were out of business. He was working deals solo. His choice, not mine. He was changing, got so he'd rather crack you than argue with you as kids in our town were finding out. Still, he was starting to build a real nice bank. I hadn't heard from Trevor and I saw less and less of Billy. He'd still call me to drive him around in whatever car he had that week. I wish I had a calendar so I would know the exact date when I went from being Billy's friend to being his errand boy. The kid was always busy. Must've had a new girl or something. Whatever it was, for the first time in his life, he was laying low-key. ANDY: I'm in. ADULT ANDY: I got back into the business. I needed cash for this deal with the Ferretti brothers, Vic and Eddie. Forty keys from 'Zona. Finally, something Billy couldn't say no to. Yo, man, I'm sorry, the guy had me on hold, man. Bud, you got me sitting here for 10 fuckin' minutes. Look, get your phone fixed, I won't have to-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. What'd the kid say? Nothing, I gotta give him 20 grand in two days if I want in. And what did you say? I told him no problem. What are you, out of your fucking mind? Yo, why don't you lend me the money, man? You lay it out, I'll run everything. You don't gotta do nothing. Yeah, Bud, I can't help you, man. I'm broke. Yeah, right. You just bought a fuckin' cigarette. Stop playing me, man. You make it in a week. Borrow the 20 grand from your old man. He'd give it to you, all right? Yo, I'm serious man. Let it go, all right? Forget about it. And fuck Vic and Eddie. You ain't gonna raise 20 grand. Those guys are full of shit anyways, -they ain't got nothing. -Lend me the cash. Lay it out. I'll run everything. -I'll make us money. -Get off my dick, all right. You got me sitting here. Would you move the fuckin' car? Huh? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] ADULT ANDY: Billy spent the rest of the day checking up on his vending machines. He had a route with some wise guys kid. He could've given me the money, but it was okay, I understood. Besides, there was another way. My friend Sal ran this club and he had a plan. I wasn't worried. I wasn't blowing this deal. FRIEND: So, this is it, huh? You got me riding down here to see a house? So Mr. I'm In Love With Somebody I Haven't Seen In Four Years, why don't you go on up and, uh, see if she still remembers you? Can't, man. I wouldn't even know what to say to the girl. FRIEND: Easy, Romeo. Why don't you start off by saying, "Baby, I love you and get your ass on the back of the bike," so we can get the hell out of here, man. C'mon, just do it. You need some help? Dude, I just don't fuckin' know. You knew once. I'm starving man. You want to eat? Eat? You're serious. You spend the last half hour breaking my heart, now you want me to eat. I can't eat, how can I eat? I can't. [COINS JINGLING] [RINGS] ADULT ANDY: Billy was getting beeped like a madman. We had to stop every 10 minutes. Business must've been really good. Yeah. What's up? No? ADULT ANDY: He was holding me up, I was supposed to meet Sal. But that's it, you never know, there's a direct line, you have these plans, but fate is busy dying and, boom, it moves you in another way. Trevor was back. If I ring the bell, then I gotta deal -with her family. -Right. I don't wanna deal with her family. Oh, man. What's up, man? You look good, bro. Yeah, you were gonna call me? TREVOR: I was just gonna call you. ANDY: You lying motherfucker. What are you doing here, huh? Where you been? TREVOR: I've been all over the place, man. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Hey. -Oh, man. Where you been hiding, huh? TREVOR: Nowhere, really. Yo, man, it's good to see you. Yeah man, fucking you guys, too. So, why you back? What do you mean, why is he back, man, -this is home! -He came back to get his-- To get one last look, man. -We're heading out west. -ANDY: Yeah, for what? See some of your old buddies from 'Zona? TREVOR: Nah, man, fuck that. We're going out to California. ANDY: Hey, Cali, man. Yeah, yeah, I might get in on that journey, you know? You know, I could use a vacation. BILLY: Bud, your whole life's a fucking vacation. Why you playing me so hard, man? -So, how long you gonna be here? -TREVOR: I don't know, man. We just got here a couple hours ago. What do think, dude, how long? You say the word, man, we gone. TREVOR: Oh, shit man, I'm sorry. Yo, guys, this is my friend, Friend. [TRAIN CHUGGING] JACK: Beautiful. Beautiful. Michael! Michael! [TRAIN CHUGGING] MICHAEL: Everything okay, Mr. Trattner? Yeah, yeah. Everything is fine. Here, Michael, take these out to the car. And be careful with them, okay? -MICHAEL: No problem. -JACK: Uh-hmm. That Michael, he's a great kid. He'll do anything. You know one time, must've been 'bout four years ago, he and this other kid, they moved some furniture into my house and they dropped my desk. Forty thousand dollars, they dropped it. So the kid Mikey, he felt terrible. But the other kid got no heart, he didn't say anything, no word, nothing. He probably said, "The fucking old Jew, he probably deals in schmattas or something like that." So I call Michael on the side, see, and I tell him, "Listen kid, I want you to forget about the desk. But first, I want you to go over to this kid and cut off one of his ears. Don't make any difference which one! And bring it to me tomorrow, you understand?" So the fuckin' kid says, "That's it?" [LAUGHS] Like it ain't nothing! So he comes back to me the next day, and he don't bring me one, he brings me two of dose things. -Holy shit. -And I bet the other kid didn't even hear him coming. JACK: Yeah, yeah, yeah! [LAUGHS] I tell you, Louie, they're a perfect match. They're almost as good as your stones! That Michael, he's a great kid, he's honorable. He'll do anything I say. He's a prince, he really is. TREVOR: No, it probably doesn't seem like a long time, man, but... a bullet in Elmira's like fuckin' 10 years on the streets, man. All I kept thinking about is, how I'm gonna get passed by, you know, everybody's out in the world just... fucking passing me by. What happened to you was fucked, man. Nobody caught it coming'. -We tried to help you out-- -Look, what happened to me is done, all right? It's history. We fucked up. I took the fall, so it's dead, it's over. Fuck it. -So what's going on in Cali? -TREVOR: I don't know, man, good fuckin' question, ask him. -Pussy's what's going on. -BILLY: Yeah? I'll relocate for Cali pussy. BILLY: Bud, you don't get no pussy nowhere, you don't even get laid here. Oh, man, why you dissing on me? Oh, please, Bud, please. Relax with the diss, all right? I don't need you playing nigger now, all right, you little walkin' fuckin' identity crisis. "Everybody wants to be a nigger 'til they are one," huh? You wanna play nigger, I'll take you up to 125th and X and you can play the whole role, all right? This kid don't get laid. Like you get pussy? What are you, out of your fucking mind? ANDY: C'mon, who'd you fuck that didn't cost you three grand in drinks? Bud, please. Please, all right? You fuckin' houseboy. Hey, don't change the subject. Who? Okay. How 'bout that girl Cindy after China Club Monday night, huh? You went to China Club Monday night? Quite fuckin' naturally. I might have forgotten to throw you an invitation, so shut the fuck up. Did I get laid? What do I look like, a boy like you, huh? I'm a fuckin' man! I'm fuckin' international. I'm getting crazy pussy constantly. Crazy pussy's in Hollywood. Hey, fuck fuckin' Hollywood, all right? Those queer dick-smoking motherfuckers. So, when you guys leaving? You guys seen Laura lately? I don't know. I haven't seen her in a couple years. TREVOR: I wanna see her before I leave. ANDY: I gotta ask you, um, why didn't you come back when you got out? I don't know, man. I wish, you know-- I wish I could answer that question. I guess... I just needed some time and it kind of multiplied, you know. -I'm late. -That's a nice watch, man. BILLY: Yeah? You wanna have a good time, you gotta have a good watch, huh? -Where you going, man? -BILLY: Hey, what are you, writing a fucking novel, huh? I gotta go back up town, I gotta see somebody. These guys will dump you off. On what, their bikes? Don't worry man, we got you covered. ANDY: If you guys want, you can crash at my place. My old man, he's still doing that whole Japan thing. -Coolin'. -So you guys still gonna be here in the morning, huh? Yeah, I think so. BILLY: All right. See you then, Bill. Zee you. Some things ain't never gonna change, man. JACK: Change, Mikey. That's what the world is all about. It's the only constant action. To know what people want and can't get is half the fight. This is how we live. You understand? I understand. Do you, Michael? I think so. JACK: I hope so. I hope you never forget what I tell you. Incidentally, Michael, those stones, I want you to take 'em, put 'em in the safe. At the club? Take care of them, Michael. No problem. Anything else you need? That's it. Goodnight, Mr. Trattner. Oh, Michael. There's another thing. This, uh-- this manager you got working at the club. -Sal? -JACK: Yeah. His name is Sal. He's been sneaking around my office! You seen him in your office? JACK: This broad, Gina, she saw him. And you believe her? JACK: I can't waste my time whether I believe her or not. I just don't want 'em sneaking around my office! So what's the answer? JACK: Throw out the girl. And keep an eye on that manager. It's so easy, man. It's so fuckin' easy. We've been doing like 20 grand, drops every Saturday night. And they don't touch the cash for at least two or three weeks. There's some big fuckin' green sitting right in the fuckin' safe. Sitting right there. And guess who's got the combination, huh? The manager, man. He lined the whole thing up, it's a done deal. All I gotta do is do it. Are you outta your fuckin' mind, man? I can't believe how fuckin' sick you actually became. That place is a wise guy joint, you wanna end up dead? There ain't no wise guys in this place. Some old Jewish guy owns it. He probably thinks it'd keep him young or something'. Look, I need this move, man. -I want it bad. -Hey, come on. Look, this place is gonna be jam-fuckin'-packed with people everywhere, bouncers all over the joint. What, are you nuts? [SCOFFS] Wrong, again. SAL: The doors close at 4:00. The fuckin' place is dead empty except for the bouncers, whatever we use that night, could be four, could be eight of them. You come around the back. They ain't gonna have a fuckin' clue what the fuck's going down. Jimmy the door, bust a few heads, kick a little ass. One of you forces me to pop the safe, we're made. Hey, what am I supposed to do, huh? I'm 23, man. Twenty-three. The kids we grew up with, some of them make a half a mil a year. Half a mil pushing stocks, you believe that shit? Yo, they're running their old man's business or something. -It's something, though. -Who gives a fuck what everyone else is doing? This place is not real! This place is science-fuckin'-fiction, man, look around. Don't make this about money, man, 'cause it's not. Look at Friend. That guy's lived everywhere: California, Florida, Vegas, New York, Chicago, Cuba. The guy's never had a frigging dollar in his pocket, but he's happy. His main goal in life is to shit and sleep indoors. All the stuff about the robbery, man, that's just part of it. I don't wanna jinx it by telling you, but, uh... [WATER BOILING] ...you remember my old guys from the neighborhood? Vic and Eddie? [EXHALES] They got one of the best fucking deals in history, man. Best fuckin' deals in history, babe. I'm hooking you so big it scares me. -Gives me the chills! -I wouldn't hook my own mother -so sweet! -We's hooking you, babe, this is sweeter than sugar. The guy, Ray, out west in 'Zona. You know the guy, Dough, Ray, Me? You know, that kid Ray, with one foot? He's getting pinched in a couple of days. He's getting pinched hard, he's going away forever. -He's outta there. -Going away for a long time -and he knows it. -He needs cash fast -and with distance. -He's getting the pinch -from the Feds. -You know, the J. Edgar Hoovers? -This kid needs cash and fast. -Babe, they're all over him. He got the tip from a junkie Fed. ANDY: This is the shit I dream about! My score. Our score. Oh, man, you used to beg for a score like this! -Yeah? -Yeah. This is a fuckin' dream. He wants to get rid of a hundred pounds of hydroponic bud from, uh-- From Aravaka. He's gonna let us take it for 40 upfront and 40 when we roll. Forty grand and it's ours. -We got 20 of it. -We're half of the way there. We need another 20. We only got three days, though. He's gotta have the wood in three days, though. Kindest bud you ever smoked, babe. A hundred elbows. We's gonna make a fortune. -And roll it over. -And over. -And over. -Big money, babe. This is the kindest herb you ever smoked! ANDY: So I got a great deal going, but as usual, it just keeps getting fucked up with a problem. EDDIE: What's the fuckin' problem, huh? Borrow the cash from your old man. You're always saying, "Hook me, Vic. Hook me, Vic." "Hook me, Eddie, hook me." -Well, you're hooked! -Well, you're hooked! -So here's your chance. -C'mon man, run with it, raise the bread, huh? Borrow from the kid Bill, he's got about a trillion or so -just laying around. -Just run with it baby, c'mon, huh? So, uh, when you gonna go see Laura? Why? ANDY: I'm curious, man, you know, you came back to get her. Yeah, say what you want, I'm not that fuckin' dumb. So, what are you gonna do, huh? What do you mean? You got no money, no job, no home. Your parents are hiding from you in Florida so you don't give your old man another stroke. You think you'd give her a good life like that, huh? Yeah, man, I think so, you know, I hope. Laura's high maintenance. Plus, uh-- plus you haven't seen her in four years. That's going to cost you, man. You gotta take care of her, take care of her right. Look, you think it's coincidence that you came back here? What are you trying to say? ANDY: Fate, man, fate. -Ah, shut up. -ANDY: Hey, look, I need you on this with me, man. Even if you don't come along, I'm gonna take care of you. I owe you. You took the heat off of me. Me and Billy. Yeah. So where's Billy in this little picture of yours, huh? Fuck him, man. Shit's different now. How's that? Hey, Billy's big-time, man. You don't know him anymore. I don't even think I know him. Kid's crazy, man. You can't talk to him. He's into 10, 15 a week. I don't even have an idea how he's making it. What, you don't work with him? Treats me like a fucking gofer. Once in a while, real rarely, like he'll throw me something -but shit, you know. -Yeah. ANDY: And that's why I gotta line this up myself. Or with you, man.
