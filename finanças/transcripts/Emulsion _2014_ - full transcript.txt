Last night I dreamt that someone loved me. - Can I help you mate? - My wife. You seen my wife? They say in dreams we live and die. But a year spent between those two worlds becomes a lifetime, neither sleeping nor awake. But a story without an ending is no story at all, where the first page is the last and the last page is missing. Keep smiling. - I am smiling. Keep smiling. - I am smiling. I am smiling. - Hello? Pierre? Does anyone have news about my wife's disappearance? - Like we said every week, Ronny... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you'll let me know. - Why are you always dressed like that, anyway? - 'Cause these are my clothes. - Why the gloves, it's not like it's cold in here. Are you cold? - I'm not cold. Are you cold? - It's an odd story. - Try us. - It was about three years ago. I'm home just hanging out. There's a knock at the door. I open the door and there's no one there. Look down, find a pair of shoes sitting on the doormat. Next night same thing happens. More shoes? - No, this time a shirt and a tie. That night, same thing happens for the next five nights to a complete suit, including a hat, gloves. - And you didn't see who put them there? - No. - And you decided to put them on? - Fitted me like a glove. They were tailor made for me, so I went out See what would happen. What it all meant. That's when I met her. - Isabella. It was a beautiful day, in the park. She sat down next to me. Asked me where I got my suit from. - Excuse me. - She wanted to buy one for her father. - Did you ever find out where the clothes came from? - No. No, this isn't about me, this has always been about Isabella. - We'll call if we make any more leads. ♫ If you thought - I noticed Tte poster in the window's missing. - Listen, Ronny, there was this guy who came in tonight asking about you. - What did he look like? - Looked serious, kept his distance, you know? He just stood by the door. Was wearing a long black coat and hat. - What did he want? Had a photograph of you. - Of me? - This photo, it was strange. Looks like you but it wasn't. - What do you mean? - Your eyes, yes, but this guy, he was too rough. - What did you tell him? - Ronny, I said nothing. - Good man. You think this has got something to do with Isabella? - He did take the poster in the window. - How long was I out for? - Since we left. - Where are we, anyways? - Nearly home. - Aren't you going to change? - Into what? What's wrong? - Nothing, I just want to get home. - I've got a surprise for you. - Something wrong, this doesn't feel right. - It won't take long. You don't remember, do you? - What? - The bridge. And where I proposed, don't you remember? - I do remember now. - I love you. - You need to call Pierre. - Who's Pierre? - Trust me, you need to call him. - Who is this guy? - Great, my battery's flat. - Isabella. - Listen, you need to call him. - Can't you just tell me? - It's a surprise. - All right, Billy. Timothy Uncle Jimmy said you might have that job going again. - We all suffer bouts of selective perception once in a while. - What makes you so sure Ronny's coming back this time? - Says here the earth spins around the sun at 67,000 miles an hour and it always comes back around. - You looking for another job? - You'd like me to look for a new job, would ya? - If you'd actually been doing your job you would have seen who took his wife or had a recording but you don't. Is that why he works here? You're feeling guilty? Look, why would you employ someone that packs his bags and leaves you every single day? - Because he's the kind of guy that comes back every single day. Hey. - Evening. - He he still after my job? - Does the pope shit in the woods? Well we're all gonna need a new job soon anyway. - How do you mean? - Well, looks like they're gonna sell this place, knock it down, no one fucking parks here anymore. - And how am I gonna find her? - You know what, you really should get out more. You know, get yourself hotel room, bottle of whiskey, couple of hookers, knock yourself out. Release the pressure. - Yeah, thanks. - It's a surprise Please, call him for me. This is Red Ice Radio.

This is Red Ice Radio. - My father used to tell me stories when things were getting me down. Legend has it that many years ago in the valley there lived a prince, and this prince kidnapped Camilla Montague, a local violinist. He told Camilla that she was composing the most beautiful rendition that man has ever had but for for his ears only to be played on the night he becomes king. It can only be performed the once and the prince would order Camilla to be executed on stage by his guards so she could never play it again. Well, for many years Camilla prayed that the prince could never become king. And somehow she would escape back to her husband. But Camilla, she was a very clever woman. - So what did she do? - Well, the night came when the prince finally became king and Camilla was on stage. - What happened? - She pulled back her bow, took a deep breath, and smiled at the king. The music she played, the music was so beautiful that it, so tragic and full of so much pain that it broke the new king's heart. The king died on the spot. You know they say Camilla is still playing even today. The king's men can't kill her. - What about the husband? - He's still waiting for her. - What does this all mean? Do you need more time? Just so you know, it's not me, it's them. They just, they just wanna know what you found out. Is it the money? This is all they gave me. Do you want me to ask for some more? - Stay with me. And only me forever. Why stay when you can go? And I want go home? - I don't think I'm ready for this. This film. - Sorry? You can never be ready for something like this. - This film always ends the same, every time I watch it. - Your favourite film? - Yes, but I was hoping for a happier ending, a better one, but it always ends the same. - At the pictures again? - Sorry about that. Everything cool? - As an Eskimo. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing, can't one smile anymore? - You look guilty. - See you later sport, have a good shift. - Can I help you? - I'm a friend of Billy's. And he said you were kind of lonely. He said I could help you. There's a woman and she goes to the cinema every day and watches the same film over and over... And Over again She wants the story to change. She wants a new ending, a different ending. No matter how many times she goes there, the ending to the film is still the same. She still comes back every single day. How do you want the story to go? How do you want it to end? - I have a request. - That's better. - Turn around. That's better. Where are you? - Where dreams go to live... ...and die! - What the fuck's wrong with you? - Sorry. - Sorry? Billy said you were a nice guy. - I got scared. - I'm still scared. Order me a cab. - Can I book a taxi, please? Put it on the account. Hello? Ronny. - Billy. Is Amy with you? - Yeah, she is. Not really what I'm about, you know? That's great, really happy for you, Where is she? - She went out to wait for a cab. Right, keep her there - What's wrong, Billy? Amy, Ronny, stay right where you are. - Hello, Ronny, I've been looking for you. Hey, where's Amy? - Did you just see a black car leave? - No, why, where is she? - Let me show you something. - Ron, what the fuck's going on? It's empty. - What? Well, he must have taken it. Who? Well the guy who took Amy! - Well, you got his registration, right? - We have to call the police. This must be the same guy who took Isabella. - Don't, you've got no fucking evidence. Fine, call, but don't give them my name. I don't want this getting back to me. - Right, good man. - I'll see what the street is saying. - Speak to detective Barry Stevens? Ronnie Maze. - So you think this is the same man who attacked your wife? - Don't know what happened to my wife. - Of course you got the reg number, though, didn't you? Come on, let's have it. - So... you and this Amy, you say you just danced? - That's right. - Nothing else? - No. - And this black car, have you got the security tape? - I told you, no. - What do you have? - Seems to me all you have are stories. - You guys aren't gonna do anything, are you? - Where's the girl? - Don't worry, I'll find her. - You know Billy, my father was a dentist. He said it's not food that rots ones teeth, but every lie we tell. - Time to reap what you sow, Billy, You know how it is, you don't return the girl... - Please let me finish my drink. - There you go. - Please let her finish this song. - Unless she's cupid, she doesn't stand a chance. Find the girl or leave town. Your choice, Billy. - Hey. - Hey. - You told the police? - Never seen you like this. - I just need to get away for here. - Did you tell Amy's people what happened? - I don't know what dreamworld you live in, mate, but in this one these guys, they'd shoot an angel in the back to get what they want. - Billy, I'm sorry. - Ronny, where were you when your wife went missing? - What do you mean? - That's two women who have gone missing now - I told you, I had to make a call. - Yeah, who were you calling? - Pierre. - Who the fuck is Pierre? - I don't know. - That's not much you do know, is there? You leave your wife alone in a car parked late at night in a strange town to make a call to a man you don't fucking know? After looking out for you, you fucked me. - I never asked. - Just... Let it be, all right? - Where will you go? - Probably the same place as your wife... As far away from you as possible. Where the fuck were you when she went missing? If you were doing your job properly, we wouldn't be here, would we? I've got something to tell you. - Keep smiling. - I am smiling. Smiling. - Hello? It's me. - Who is this? This about Isabella? Stop doing that. - Who is this? Stop doing that, something to tell you. - Doing what? Stop rewinding it back and forth. - I'm sorry, I don't understand. That's right. That's me in the phone box, been trying to call you. - What do you want? You Keep going forward, keep rewinding. - Listen. There's a man... He lives deep in the woods, it's a dark place. Where dreams live and die. He's the one, he's the one doing all this. - Doing what? They watch you Measure you up. Work you out. They make the clothes fit. - Is he the one who's got Isabella? Who is he? He's the one. - What has he done with her? Hello? - Someone just called me from this number. I think with time travel we could be using that as a means of changing something, viewing something, being able to see. We don't feel we can go back in time because we would change the future. I think the idea of going forward in time. Speak of that would be fascinating. - Isabella? Isabella? Isabella? Isabella. Amy. Thank God you're okay. - I'm not okay. - Who is he? Who is he? - I don't know. - What did he want with you? - Information. - About what? - You. - Me? - Yeah, you. - I have to get you back to Billy. - I'm going nowhere with you. He's getting away. - I've toyed with him. I've played with him, in fact, he's watching me. Right now. He really has no idea how deep all this goes. I think it's time he took a peek behind the curtain. - Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you. I was just admiring your splendid suit. I was wondering if you could tell me where you got it from? - Isabella. - I need to buy one for my father. - It's a long story. - Try me. - Hello? Hello, Ronny, I've been looking for you. - How long have you been watching me and my wife? Got the evidence right here you sick fuck. Where is she? Isabella. - Is she? Is she still alive? Of course. - Tell me where she is. The last time I saw her she was in a dark place with a sword to her neck, praying the prince would never become king. - I'll do anything, just tell me what you want me to do. I want you to meet me. - Will you tell me where she is? Meet me at the bridge at seven and I'll take you to her myself. - Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you but I was just admiring your splendid suit. I was wondering if you could advise me where you got it from as I need to find one for my father. - I'm sorry, but it's a really long story. Black Jaguar... - So, Troy Westwood. You're a private detective. - Right. Why not start with something I don't know? And get me a nice cup of coffee while you're at it, angel. - You're a long way from home. What are you doing here? - My client's reported someone missing. - What clients? - You know that's confidential. It's a long word, should I spell that for you? - This who you're looking for? - Is this the person? - No. - No? - All that drum and bass made you deaf? - Do you know this woman or not? - Sure. Do you know this man? - That's confidential. - Yeah, we know him. - Are you sure you know him or you just know of him? They're two very different things. - Hi. Where the hell have you been? - Sorry? - I reported this stolen, and all the time you had it. - What do you mean? - The car. Got the keys? - I'm not giving you my keys. - I see, bit too big for your boots, are we? - Listen, I don't know you. - And I thought I knew you, buddy. - You know me? You don't know me. - No, no, obviously no. - Isabella. Where are you going now? - Isabella!! Isabella. Is... Nice dress, it suits you. Thanks. - I'm sorry to bother you, I was just admiring your splendid suit. Oh, hello, where have you been? - Who are you people? Why are you dressed like that? - Because they're my clothes. - No, they're my wife's clothes. What have you done with her? - Are you okay mate? - Where's Isabella? - Why are you always dressed like that? - Aren't you going to change? - Into what? Into what? - Remember, prop cars aren't for you to keep. Here you go, keep your piece of shit car, your majesty. - Must be blood on their swords, their fight is noble. The fool has forgotten the broken blood, and when the passion and vitriol all become plucid, the orgy of the battle becomes doused in water and fades into the stream. I beg of you, Walk wisely, look back thankfully as I do as your king. - Keep it real, good, good, good, great. Haven't seen you in ages, where have you been? - Looking for her. - She's moved up in this world. She's really going places. Pierre has done wonders for her. - Pierre? - Between you and me, the same thing he did for you. - What'd he do for me? - Don't worry, I won't tell a soul. - Is Pierre here? - No. - I still love you. - The king is dead, long live the king. - Isabella. Isabella, it's me. - This isn't real. There's a man, he lives deep in the woods. He's the one, he's the one doing all of this. I'm not your wife. You know that, don't you? I do now. This isn't real, this isn't real. I'm not your wife, you know that don't you? You know that don't you? - How long is this going to take? - Well, took you long enough to find Ronny. - Well, the longer it takes me the more I get paid, what's your excuse? - Listen, Ronny was an actor in some TV drama but he went missing after the first episode about a year ago. They had him replaced with that guy from that horror film, Sat on the Barge, remember? Jaw Lock... I like that movie. - Anyway, they said he couldn't stay in character so they sent him to see a hypnotherapist, Dr. Pierre Vallade. - And he's still living there, then, isn't he? - Who? - Well as you refer to him, Ronny. Where? - There, where the sea is black, black like the lungs of a chain smoking whore. - Working in the coal mines of hell. - Jaw Lock now, is it? - Yeah, good movie. - I can't believe you left it so long to see me. Now, just relax and take a few deep breaths. Now, remove your hat. That's it, one by one. Remove each layer. Letting go of Ronny with every breath. Repeat after me, last night I dreamt that someone loved me. - Last night, I dreamt that someone loved me. - When you hear me clap this hypnotic state will be over. Ronny will be gone. What is your name? I said, what is your name? - My name? My name is Salvador. ♫ Given that you've been told... ♫ You're always... ♫ Running from hot to cold... ♫ Don't you to go ♫ Giving up on your friends... search light on... ♫ Digging up everything ♫ You know why... when you're on your own... - Here you go.
