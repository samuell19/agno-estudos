(AIR WHOOSING) (BELL DINGS) (NEEDLE DROP) (UPBEAT MUSIC) All I need is $36 and a handgun. We got handguns. What's the $36 for? That's how much it's gonna cost for a bottle of Henny. You nervous, why you want the Henny? I just always make my best decisions when I drink. What's up Pop? Slide me a bottle of Henny on the cool. But yo let me ask you something, why we so stuck on the neighbors? Because who the fuck else is there? The pussy boy. Pussy boy, who the fuck is that? The Ellen Degeneres looking motherfucker. What? The clerk from the fucking store! You think he'd put up a fight? You talking about robbing a store that we was just seen on camera buying from? I just started thinking about it, why not? You wanna end up on the nightly news and have every motherfucker in the city knowing our faces? Then I say we stick to the neighbors tonight. It's easy, it's low risk. But easy doesn't always mean the biggest reward. Yo we gotta start somewhere, easy doesn't sound like too bad of a fucking place to start. We got it planned, we're familiar, and most importantly it's not a store that we discovered two minutes ago! But listen to me... Also, you know that every bodega got a Pakistani motherfucker with a shotgun behind the counter waiting to blow your shit off. That was a young white dude though! It don't matter man! Look it plays out two ways, he's pussy and he doesn't give a fuck or he doesn't give a fuck 'cause he's too pussy! Yo Dre, why you so set on this fucking store? Well that's the best part, while I was looking for my diet strawberry daiquiris, I was walking around and I saw a big brown box in the back. The top was slightly open. Uh huh? Some interesting shit was written on the inside of that box. And what'd it say? R-O-L-E-motherfucking-X. TOGETHER: Rolex! That's what I saw written on the little green case peaking outta the big brown box in the back which I bet houses at least 10 more watches judging by the size of the box. Hey stupid, there's no way that store had 10 Rolexes. There's no way that shit even had one. Your eyes are playing tricks on you Dre. Real Rolexes? Nah. But official or not, I could name five motherfuckers, Pip from Queensbridge being one of them, who can't tell the difference between a Rolex and a plastic watch you give a little kid for his fucking birthday. And you know how much them shits could be worth? I don't gotta fucking tell you, you already know. Yo Dre, I don't normally change plans, especially not last minute. But this time, I'mma go with you on this one. But we gotta do this shit right, no dummy shit, okay? Of course no dummy shit, of course. I'm rolling with you.

I was watching TV the other day, I never fucking watch that shit, there's too many subliminal messages. You know what I'm saying Nevertheless it was on and they're airing this documentary about a drug dealer murdered in his own home by people he sees all the time. Not some hitman but people he considered to be his friends. I thought to myself "fuck that shit", so Buddy, Al and those Airbuds there were hired. Airbuds? No more like fucking Cujos, man. I guess at means they're effective. You ever had to use them yet? No and honestly, I hope I never have to, but doesn't mean they're not experienced though. Used to belong to this mob boss Uptown.

And not everything goes with Pink Floyd or Bob Marley, okay? I got light shit, dark shit, weird shit, and it all corresponds with a different synthetic strand.

Originally this was called Agent Orange, but then I synthetically mixed it, spliced it together with California Dreamin' and turned it into a trip. Hey Stevie, let me ask you something. Ask away. I know you said it's a secret and I understand that, but is your stash close by? I mean the reason I ask is as much as I fuck with this new method, there's nothing like smelling and touching, you know? Yeah I'll tell you what, you find one you like, I'll let you touch and smell the shit out of it, but until then, let's just say that Nicolas Cage in "National Treasure" would have a real hard time finding it. (LAUGHING) - That's good. - Yeah. Hey, no but I do see where Francisco's coming from here. I mean you gotta admit it's pretty fucking difficult to get an idea of the strand solely from the music. I mean, we don't even know what this weed looks like, tastes like or smells like, and when you're looking to buy something new, which we are, all three of those things are very, very important. So um, what do you think? We could go and see your stash. I'm enjoying this. You guys don't seem to be. No, no, no. Hold on, no, no, we never said we aren't enjoying it. This is fucking great. We're just not used to doing business - in this fashion. - Right. Guys I'm conflicted here, okay. I've got two devils on my shoulder. One, the salesman in me is saying hey Stevie, these two guys are gonna have a much better idea, buying experience if you will, if they can touch and smell the shit, see what I have to offer. The second is the felon in me, saying don't fucking trust body and keep your shit hidden away and therefore safe. What's a guy to do? Look man, there's a disconnect here if you don't think you can trust us. I mean, come on. Here's the thing, I don't like to think anything, I like to know. Amen. You mind if Francisco and I have a quick word in the corner? Yeah sure. Just don't come back saying some shit I don't wanna hear, huh? Right. Yeah sure, I mean. Come on. ♪ Alright just act like we're having a normal conversation, okay? Let's not get this fucking wack job any more paranoid than he already is.

Well you know he's expecting us to buy some real fucking nice expensive shit. Problem is I don't really have the inclination to spend that kind of money.

Yeah the guard didn't catch it in the pat down, - what about you? - No, no (CHUCKLES) I forgot my piece at home because last time we came here a fucking banana gun would have been sufficient. Well I'm not about to start a gunfight where I'm outnumbered by people and by dogs. Where does that fucking leave us then? Like I said, we buy something, it doesn't have to be big, it could even be a dime bag, just enough to appease him and make it appear like we didn't waste his time and leave with nothing. We cook up an excuse as to why we need to leave early, the vaguer the excuse the better, then we promise we'll return in the future which of course we never do and we forget about this crazy fuck forever. How does that sound? What are we gonna tell the boss? We'll figure that out later. Fuck I can't think of anything else. Me neither. Alright, let's do it. You guys get enough time to talk through what you needed? Yeah. And? We're gonna have to continue this transaction some other time, man. I'm sorry. And why is that? Well we had some um, unexpected financial shit that came up. But we do wish to purchase a small sample. A dime bag, so you know we didn't waste your time. Right. Guys, there's a reason I have an $8000 apartment and why I can afford to hire 24 hour black guy/canine security. It's 'cause I put in the fucking work. I worked hard to develop my own shit so that I can make sure that my shit is the shit. You put my shit next to any guy's shit, I guarantee that my shit is gonna shit on their shit. But you know, as they say, when you're at the top, every fucking body wants to bring you down. Now figuring out who people are, that's the hard part. For all I know, Buddy and Al over here could turn a couple Nat Turners on me and wake me up one night with a bullet in my head. But I'm particularly confident in their loyalty. I can't say the same about everybody else though. So yeah, a dime bag, I'm not sure I'm interested in selling you two a dime bag after that load of a bullshit excuse you guys gave me. You know, for a second, I thought I had Louis CK and... fuck, you know I can't think of a Mexican comedian's name right now but you guys get the point. I thought I had a fucking couple of comedians in here because of that bullshit joke of an excuse. Some financial shit? Really? No guys, my desire to sell you two some high quality shit has faded. But I am interested in selling you two an opportunity. - Oh Stevie! - An opportunity to leave this apartment exactly - the way you are now. - Stevie, come on! I'm not finished! Now, I'm sure that Buddy here could break off your fingers, just as easily as Al could rip your knees caps off, and that would be very easy. Even easier still would be if Al were to hold you down while Buddy gave you a root canal with a screwdriver. Now, he is a licensed physian, I'm pretty sure he would do a great job. But none of that's gonna be necessary if you play a little game of trust with me. I'm sorry, are you fucking with us right now? You call me out of the blue, talking about something big, and then all of a sudden you gotta split when I don't show you my stash? Something's not fucking right about it and I wanna know about it right now. Everything is fucking fine, Stevie! Shut the fuck up, Kelly! Who the fuck is named Kelly anyway? That's a goddamn girl's name. No guy is named Kelly. Alright guys, this is how this works, you two are gonna tell me exactly what it is that you two spoke about over there or you're gonna leave this apartment saying, "Oh gosh, I wish I would have told Stevie "the truth, I'm so sorry, Stevie." Oh well you want to know what we spoke about in the fucking corner, you son of a bitch? I want to know the fucking truth! We already told you the fucking truth and you called it a load of bullshit, what the fuck? It's true! We have a money issue and it's gotta get resolved. There's nothing else to say. Well I'm about done with this shit. You guys still want that dime bag? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah we do. Here's the second part of that synthetic strain. Ooh, it's a real party when you smoke this shit. (ROCK MUSIC) Yeah it's good. Yeah this is good, man. We'll take this. Yeah it will blow you away guys. Let me go get it for you, okay? ♪ We're so close to getting out of here. That fucker scares the fuck outta me, man. Yeah, those guys are big. Hey man, you really a licensed physician? Man what kind of stupid question is that? Shut the fuck up, man. Are you fucking stupid? Shut up. Ah where the fuck is he? Make sure they don't leave. Oh shit! (SCREAMING) Fuck you, you son of a bitch! You don't know who you're fucking with! Fuck you! Get the fuck off! You know, I was thinking about what to do with you rats, and well, your teeth are looking a little yellow, so maybe they could use a good cleaning, uh? No, no, no!

Hey wait, hold up. What's up? Are you a Knicks fan? No. Damn alright never mind. Aye I fuck with that shirt though! Thanks bro! You're popular here. Alright is there anything specific you wanna do while you're in the city? I gotta get those dumplings again. Oh at Radiance, Radiance dumplings. - But those dumplings are expensive. - I know. Did Mommy give you the card? Of course she did. Of course she did. 'Cause I can't be funding you for an entire four days, you know that? You know, also, we should hit that vintage guitar shop on the way to your house. Okay. So that's it? Guitars and dumplings? That's all you want? I mean, yeah. Guitar, dumplings, a bar. Uh a what? A bar. - A bar? - Yes. Why are we going to a bar? You wanna drink? Yeah I wanna drink. I can't take you to a bar. Why, 'cause of Mom? Yeah cause of Mom, I told her I was gonna take care of you and watch out for you, not take you to a bar and have you drinking tequila shots. ♪ Bro I really need to take a piss. The theater's like two blocks, can't you just wait 'til we get there? No I need to go now. We're in the middle of the street, come on. I'll just go in an alley. You can't go in an alleyway bro. You're a big boy. Alright how 'bout here, the lights are on, let's check here. We already closed the kitchen. I just need to use the bathroom, is that okay? Yeah sure. Just put a dollar in the tip jar when you leave. Thank you. You know, we got a fresh brew if you wanna buy some coffee. No I'm okay thank you. Alright, I mean, you're already paying for the restroom, might as well pay for a cup of coffee. Okay yeah sure, I'll take a cup of coffee. I'll just charge you a dollar. Okay. Hi. ♪ Thanks. It's a fresh brew, right? Made in the last 24 hours. What's wrong? You don't like the taste? No, it's good. It's just different. You know, I don't like coffee. I own a coffee shop, but I can't stand the taste. love the smell but I hate the taste. (LAUGHING) That's interesting. You ready? Yeah. Thank you very much. Have a good night. You got it. Thank you. Hey boss, your door's locked. Yeah and it's gonna stay locked. Come back over here. What do you mean? Why? Don't make me repeat myself. We're gonna do whatever you want. Archer if they ask for your wallet, give them your wallet, okay? I didn't catch your name, guy. My name's Allen. Yeah. You're about to be passed the fuck out Allen, because that brew had a quart of ketamine in it. I need your little brother to finish the drink. It'll be a whole lot easier drinking a nice little cup of joe than dealing with the butt of that gun. Just drink it. Don't waste a drop now. What should we do to pass the time? Archer we're gonna be fine. We're gonna be fine. Allen! That answer your question? Come on, let's tie him up. Where do you want him? Put him in the storage room for now. And him? He goes to the normal spot, right? Yeah put the little one in the operation table. Hey Daryl, this one is scared. I bet your heart is going 100 times a minute. You know, someone would pay 200 grand for that right there. Looks like we're gonna make good on our promise after all. (RATS SQUEAKING) (GROANING) What the fuck? Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
