Mom! Forgive me, dear. Forgive me. This is all I can do to protect you. Remember, my child. Remember what I have told you. Lingsir Wengi. Can you please open your mouth? You can close it, now. Nurse, please take off her bandages. So, how is it, Doc? Here's the thing, Mr. Gatot... ...the burn injury on Mala's neck... ...is called laryngitis infection. So, she's probably can't speak... ...for the next few days. With two or three weeks of treatment... ...I can make sure she will recover. My other patients are waiting for me, please excuse me, Mr. Gatot. Good. Thank you, Doc. You're welcome. It's okay, baby. Aunt Manda... ...and Uncle Gatot will always be there for you. Okay? You'd better get some rest now. We have to take her home. I know. Mala doesn't have anybody. We are her only family. Yeah. And... ...I promised to my sister, Nawang... ...to take care of Mala if something ever happened to her. Okay. Lingsir Wengi is a ballad... ...to repel scary and haunted things in our life. It makes us strong, safe, and free from any disease... ...and bad luck. We will arrive soon. I'm sure you will love our place, Mala. Mala, this is Bagas. He is our youngest son. The naughtiest, ignorant and... What do kids these days call it? Kepo? That's it, peko. Kepo! Yeah, I know. I am kepo, but not the naughtiest. Desi is the naughty one. Mala, this is for you. You can write in here. Look. Hello. And then you can erase it. Here you go. Bagas, just let her rest. Come on in. This is our house. Make yourself at home, okay? I want to get rest first. Okay. Miss Rahma. Yes, ma'am? Mala, come here. Mala, this is Ms. Rahma. If you ever need anything, just ask Ms. Rahma here. Where's Desi by the way? She's not home yet. She said she already told you about going with her friends. Maybe she's celebrating her 17th birthday with her friends. You're probably right. See? I'm not the naughty one. It's Desi! Let's go to your room upstairs, shall we? There's your room. Mala. Come here. This is your room. Mala, you are the only niece that Uncle Gatot has. We're so glad to have you here. We hope you will like it here. Wait. My gosh, he hasn't clean this place. Right. Mala, I've prepared some clothes for you. This is actually Desi's. But I know you two wear the same size. I hope you don't mind. Here you go. (Thank you.) Anytime, dear. I'll leave you to rest now. (Tembang Lingsir is a song created for many purposes.) (One of them is to ward off evil spirits.) (Whenever disaster strikes and there are dangers of impending evil and demons...) (...then your faith to the God Almighty will protect you from accursed evil.) Mrs. Amanda asked you to join dinner, sir. Has Desi come home yet? Not yet, sir. What are you doing? Bringing that girl into this house? I don't have any choice. Her mother... Her mother passed away when their house burned down. I've no other choice than to take Mala with me. Did you forget? The time is near! Are you prepared for that? I'm prepared for that. See you tomorrow. Take care, baby. Bye. Thank you. It's okay. I got this. Wait a second, dear. Yes, mom. Hi, mom and dad. - Hi. - Hi. Desi... ...I can't allow you to celebrate your birthday out there. But I already have a plan. - I can't cancel my... - No. This is not a discussion. But I'll allow it next year. Yeah, but I have plans with my friends. Only with Gladys and Bella. And Doni, my honey bunny gorilla. This is grown up talks. Hey, come on... ...do you have to fight at the dinner table? Desi, you haven't said anything to your cousin. It's Mala. You remember? Hi. Did you wear my clothes? I gave it to her, Desi. Both of you wear the same size. You don't mind, do you? I don't mind, actually. I'm not wearing it anymore, anyway. Desi. I want to talk to you. Be good to Mala. She just went through a lot of things. Can you imagine that? She's going to live with us forever, doesn't she? Well, we're the only family she has. What about her school? She's not going to the same school as mine, right? Well, I don't really care about that. But don't ask me... ...to be responsible for her. Why did you say that? Desi, look at this. You used to be very close with Mala. See? Yeah, but this was... ...back before she got weird. Three, four, five... One, two... She used to zoned out all of a sudden. What are you looking at? Mala, is something wrong? And then, she sings. That's so creepy! What are you singing? Since then, I don't want to go to Aunt Nawang's place anymore. Let me go! It hurts! But that was back then. She's a freak, mom. She's coming for you. Remember. Lingsir Wengi Mala, what's wrong? Sorry you had to sleep on the floor. Bagas doesn't want to share his bed. Mala. I know you're still upset. You're exhausted... ...your mind is roaming. Maybe that makes you see things. So, I think you'd better get some rest. (Thank you.) Have a good sleep. Good night. ♪I came here to tell you something.♪ ♪About how important Lingsir Wengi.♪ ♪Please listen to me.♪ ♪You have to sing this song.♪ ♪My child, you still remember about Lingsir Wengi, right?♪ Amanda! Amanda! Desi! This is not real... This is just a dream... This is just a dream... This is just a dream... Help! Amanda? Amanda? Who... Oh, God. How could you, Gatot? Who are you? - Baby! - Hai! - Miss you so much. - Forget about me already? Of course not. Are your parents home? Mom's at the office, dad's inside. - Good. - Let's go inside! I miss all of you! - One, two, three, four... - Des... Who is she? Nobody. Let's go. Wow, you got six! Desi. You still draw weird things? That's your opinion. But I just love it. Yeah, but don't you have any other object that you could draw? Let me see it. Who is this? I don't know. I just dreamt about her a lot. Something's not right with you. By the way, how about Doni? He'll come tomorrow. That's sweet. The time is near. It has been 17 years since that incident. Then why haven't you prepared for it? I have started it, Gatot. I strongly advise you to bring your family out of this house. That is not an easy thing to do. Especially with my wife. Your wife is just an obstacle! The time is near! Mala's presence here was no mere coincidence. Wengi! Honey. What happened to you? Ever since Mala's incident, I feel like you're a different person now. Is there anything you want to say to me? Sis... ...let's get back inside. I don't like being here. Let's go. Amanda. I think it is time for you to know. What is this room? Who is she? She is... ...the Kanjeng Ratu. Kanjeng Ratu? Who is she? She is... ...the one who protects her disciple, so they are always under her protection. Forgive us, Kanjeng Ratu. - Amanda, please... - Don't come any closer! I can explain this... - Don't come any closer! - I am your husband. Listen to me! Seventeen years ago, that... Don't come any closer. I can explain, please. I can explain. - I don't want to hear it. - I can explain. - Stop! Stop it! - I... Forgive me, Kanjeng Ratu. Come on, let's talk outside. I will explain everything to you. Where's mom and dad going? I don't know. But I hope they won't be back anytime soon. What are you up to now? Gladys and Bella are coming again? This is grown up business. Not for kids. - Hello, Bella. Are you coming? - Weirdo. Mala. How's your voice? (Still hurts.) - Cheers! - Cheers! - Let's do a selfie! - Yeah, let's do it. One, two, three. Thanks for coming, girls. Finally you're seventeen, Des. Is there any more secret? What? Are there any more secrets that you've been hiding from me? You are a bit weird sometimes. I remember... ...you always came home at midnight. And you smell like incense. I even saw... ...a figure of a woman with roots all over her body. And when I told you about that... ...you said I was just tired and seeing something. - So, that's what happened? - Listen to me first! Stop. Pull the car over right here. Amanda! I can't deal with this anymore. You're not the husband I married to. Amanda. Where do you think our house came from? All your jewellery and all the luxury we have? Who gave it to us? Including our son's needs, Bagas. I did all of this for our family. Did what? Tell me! Pesugihan. What? Yes. Pesugihan! I made a deal... ...with Kanjeng Ratu. I did this so our family will always live in wealth. Stop. Don't you dare bring our family into this conversation. This is just about you! Who is Kanjeng Ratu? I don't know you anymore. Amanda! Amanda! Before I met you... ...I was buried in debt. What did you do in the past that you have to be buried in debt? It's not about me, Amanda. But my father. My father who passed down all his debt to me! I don't want to live as a child with no future, Amanda. I want to be rich. I just want to enjoy my life. I want to live a decent life like everyone else. That is why... ...I decided to meet Rahma. Our caretaker? Well... Actually... She is a shaman. Amanda. She is a shaman who takes care of my Pesugihan to Kanjeng Ratu. Kanjeng Ratu! Wow, a six. Come on, do it again. Another six. Wait, another six? Wait, wait. Let me try it. I haven't got my turn. Oh, man! Wait here. No... Oh, no! Mala! The dice went inside this room. I have to get inside. Come on in, it's alright. I think I saw dad opened the storeroom once. Even though I was not inside, I saw dad kept his keys on this table. But where is it? Not here. Where is it? Found the key! What did she ask for all that wealth? A soul... Our child's. Don't tell me you're going to sacrifice our daughter for this. You're going to trade away Desi's life! You bastard! Listen to me, Amanda! No one is going to be sacrificed! I love my family. I love you. It's not going to be Desi. Then... ...who? Mala. But, Mala... She is not... Mala is your daughter? Is she? But, Desi... They're twins. Twins? But they don't look... They're fraternal twins. I separated them since birth. I gave Mala to my sister, Nawang... ...so that she could be safe from the curse of Kanjeng Ratu. But it did not stop it. All of that was in vain. Kanjeng Ratu will return 17 years from then... ...and she will take the soul of whoever will be sacrificed. I made a mistake, Amanda. Please forgive me. Kanjeng Ratu! Kanjeng Ratu... Amanda, we have to go back. Now! What happened? Mala will enter adulthood tonight. And without a special ritual... ...all of us will die. No... No... We have to get back! We have to get back, Amanda! Come on! Hurry up, Amanda! Mala. Mala... ...help me. Please, help me. Help me, Mala. Mala. Mala. Help me, Mala. Mala. Sis. I found it. Come on. This is all your fault. If only you didn't do Pesugihan.. ...our kids' lives won't be in danger! We have to go back home right now. Hurry! Stop the car! Weren't we just here before? Isn't this the place where we argued earlier? Wait a minute. This is the place, right? We have to get out of this place with any cost. Forgive us, Kanjeng Ratu. Please don't lead us into astray. We're going home now. I will drive. Where's Desi? Let's look for her, this place freaks me out. Bel. Did you hear that? I heard a sound of a gamelan. That must be nothing. Come on. Let's take a look. But... Come on! Gladys! It smells incense in here. I have a bad feeling. Let's leave this place. You're not funny. Don't be such a killjoy. Are you crazy? What are you talking about? Do you think this a human painting? It looks weird. Meaning? - Hurry up, Gladys! - Careful, Bella. Gladys... Hey, where are you girls going? I'm going home. Home? But this is my birthday. Whatever, I just want to go home, now. You look like you've just seen something. Des, let us go home, or I will scream. Gladys, there's no use in screaming, we don't have any neighbours. Then let us leave! Move! Your house is creepy! - Gladys... Bel... - Hurry up! Doni? Happy birthday, beautiful. Oh my god. Did you have to go through my window? - Yeah, so? - Well... - Thank you! - You're welcome, baby. This is so cute. Where's Bella and Gladys? It's a long and annoying story. Once again, thank you, baby. I have to tell you something. We can't go anywhere. Is it okay if we just stay here? Here? - Just the two of us? - Yeah. Why not? Bella, are you serious you want to go through this place? I don't know. As long as we stay as far as we can from that house. Bella. Who is that? She's coming here! - Gladys, run! - Bella... - Gladys! - Bella! Hurry! Bella! Bel! Wait for me! Bella! Gladys! Hurry up! Bella! Bel? (Gatot And Murni) (1996) Who is this? I don't know. I just dreamt about her a lot. She is coming for you. Bella! Bel? Your house is a bit creepy. So, we're the only one here to celebrate your birthday? Yeah. Well, I don't mind. It's more fun that way. I have to go inside. Wait here, okay? Mom. Please, no! Miss? Hold on, dear. Just a little bit more. Just a little bit more, Murni. Come on. A little bit more. - A little bit more. - Good, just keep it that way. It's here! Gatot, it's your child. She's a girl. My daughter. My daughter. Hey. My daughter. My daughter. It's me, your dad. Remember your promise, Gatot. You have to hand the child to Kanjeng Ratu. That's your promise. No, not my daughter. Give her to me! There has to be another way! Hand her now! Remember your promise! She's my daughter. Gatot! There's another one! You have a twin! She's coming to claim what's hers. The promise that you have made. Hand the girl over to Kanjeng Ratu. - No. - You have another daughter now. Take this baby, Kanjeng Ratu! Take this baby, Kanjeng Ratu! No! Stop! Don't take my baby! Murni! No! Don't! Murni! Murni! No! Murni! No! No! Don? Where are you? Doni? Doni? What are you doing here? Can't you knock first? What are you doing? (We have to go.) Go? What do you mean? Wait... Wait. Gatot? Something's wrong? Don? Doni! Where is he? Mala! Mala! Stop it! Come on. We have to keep moving. Let's go. Okay. Mala, what do you want? (We're twins.) No way! We're not twins! Stop talking nonsense! Mala? What happened? Why is your face turning pale? What happened to you? What happened to you? (But she is your real mother.) Gatot. The lights are out. Get the flashlight, hurry! Come on! Desi! Desi? Mala? Mala? Mala! Desi. Kanjeng Ratu is here. She will take Mala. - Gatot, look. Desi! - Desi! Desi! Desi... Desi... - Desi... - Desi. Honey. There's Mala! - Mala. - Mala. Please, wake up. Mala, wake up. Mala, listen to me, please. You have to sing Lingsir Wengi that your mother taught you. You have to sing Lingsir Wengi, now! Mala... Wake up, Mala! Wake up! Wake up, Mala! Come on, you can do it, Mala. Please. Help me, Mala. Kanjeng Ratu, please. Nobody needs to die anymore. Just take my life! - Desi... - Desi. Desi? Desi, please listen to me. You are twins with Mala. You are fraternal twins. I'm sorry for separating both of you. Forgive me. Forgive me. I know you're upset. Please help your little sister. Come on, Desi. Come on, Desi. Mala. Mala! Wake up, Mala! Wake up! Please, wake up. You can do it. Wake up, Mala! You have to fight it! Mala! Wake up, Mala! Mala! Mala... Mala... - Wake up, Mala! - Forgive me, Mala! - You can do it. - Please, wake up, Mala. Mala... - Mala! - Wake up, Mala! Wake up, Mala. - Mala, wake up! - Please wake up! Mala. I promise... ...I will return to the right path. Bagas, come here.
