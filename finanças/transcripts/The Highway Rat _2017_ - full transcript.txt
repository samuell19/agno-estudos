ANT SQUEAKS ANTS GASP Yes, I am the rat of the highway and nobody dares to refuse. - We have no sweets! - The ants replied. We just have this nice green leaf. - Oh, no, you don't!

FROG CROAKS With never a "please" or a "thank you", the Rat carried on in this way. Flies from a spider... milk from a cat... He once stole his own horse's hay! RAT LAUGHS DUCK SIGHS SOFTLY The creatures who travelled the highway grew thinner and thinner and thinner... THEY GASP ..while the Highway Rat grew horribly fat. Ooh... He's eating up everyone's dinner! - ECHO: - Dinner! Dinner! Dinner! Ooh! - ECHO: - Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Hmm... Ah! DUCK EXHALES A duck came waddling down the road, then stopped with a... How do you do?

But I am the rat of the... - Highway? - The highway! - The highway! - Yes! I am the rat of the highway and I fancy a duck for tea! - Hang on! - Quacked the duck. For I have a sister with goodies you might prefer. I know that she'd love to meet you and I'm certain that you'd like her. For in her cave, her deep, dark cave, right at the top of the hill, are biscuits and buns aplenty! And there you may eat your fill. - Yeah! Lead on! - Cried the Rat. Ooh! RAT GRUNTS Ha! And they took to the road - which seemed it would never end. Onwards they rode and upwards. - Here. - Bend after bend after bend. At last, they came to a lonely cave and the duck began to quack. - She quacked... - Good evening, sister! Sister? Sister! - And... ECHO: - Sister! Sister! Sister! ..a voice from the cave came back! Shhh! - Do you have cakes and chocolates? - The Highway Robber cried. And... - ECHO: - Chocolates! Chocolates! Chocolates! - The voice from the cave replied. - I'm coming to take them!

Faster and ever faster, following all the bends, the plucky young duck went... - Riding, riding! - ..riding - galloping down the highway - back to her hungry... Friends! Here! THEY LAUGH AND CHEER Then they shared out the food from the saddle bags and feasted all night long. Bright were the flames of the bonfire. Loud was the music and song. ANTS CHEER Oh! Oh... Wild was the moonlight dancing... Merry the cheer and chat. For now we can live in freedom safe from the Highway Rat. And what of the Rat in the echoey cave? WIND HOWLS WATER DRIPS RAT GROANS Oh...
