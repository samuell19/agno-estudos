This is a special live broadcast of the Double Gold Cup race. Because Uncle is not feeling well, So tonight, I'll be the only commentator. Okay, the betting rate for 2 and 3 is the top bet. Only seven to one. God of Guan, please blessed that no.7 Fire Unicorn wins. We all bet heavily on this horse. -Oh shit! It'll lose this time. -I am even worse. My house is gone. Yue, Ah Shek just said on TV... that the horse is lame and has diarrhea. Is it true? Of course it is true. It was lame just to make sure it will win this time. It has diarrhea just to cleanse it's digestive system. It can race on an empty stomach. Are you sure? -You don't believe me? -We don't know if it is true or not. Let's call Rat and ask him. Just to make sure. Rat, is your information reliable? Of course it is reliable. If Accidental Guest doesn't win... I'll kill you. I took all my sister's money and bet on the horse. Okays, if it doesn't win, I come and let you kill me. Okay, it's done. We are rich. How is it? Rat said it's reliable. He said Fire Unicorn's owner had bet millions of dollar on the horse. Great, if I had money, I wouldn't have to entertain so many customers. You are hopeless. With money, you don't have to entertain but to choose your customer. You call this promising? If I had money, I'll quit working as a PR girl. I haven't thought of that. If I had money, I'll take revenge on this guy. That bloodsucker, manager Wu. Right, this guy is so mean. If we turn on the air conditioner a bit higher, he said we are wasting electricity. And count how much toilet paper we use when going to toilet. Our salary was cut this way. If I had money, I'll scold him and quit. Right. That bloodsucker's evil demeanor will come to no end. What are you doing here? There are so many customer outside, you girls have nothing to do? You turn on the air conditioner and the TV, electricity doesn't come cheap. We feel hot. You feel hot, the you go and look for customer. The air conditioning in the VIP room is freezing. Nobody asks for us. -Of course they don't ask for you. -What can we do? One, you are not sexy enough. Two, you don't spend much to pretty up yourself. Look at you, every time you go to work, you manicure. This is big taboo, of course nobody will ask for you. Go and sit outside. -Run. -Find a seat. Find a good seat first. -What are you doing? -One minute. I'll deduct your pay. Whatever. Run, Fire Unicorn. Speed up. Speed up. Speed up. Fire Unicorn come in last, why are you so happy? Right. This is bitter laugh. Speed up. Go, Run. -Fire Unicorn... -No. -What are you doing? -No. - I bet big money on it. Can't lose. -No. -Fire Unicorn... -No. I'm rich...I got it this time. Fuck it. Are you nuts? Something's wrong with you? You win and you cry, you lose and you laugh. This is abnormal. If this horse can win, nobody will have normal reaction. You girls laugh and cry, are you crazy? It's none of your business. You talk to me like this? I dare not raise my voice when I am poor. Now that I got money, I can raise my voice. You have money? I've got good news. We won 9 million dollars, I quit. No, Manager Wu. Listen to me. What are you afraid of? We quit when we have money. I'll still be a PR girl, even when I am rich. Being a PR girl is my lifetime career. I beg of you, manager Wu. We go and work somewhere else. You just said he's a mean bastard and limits our use of toilet paper. -This is not mean, this is thirfty. -What's the matter with you? -We won the horse race and can give him hell. -Right. Don't you say that. We got to have good virtue when we are rich. Screw you. Wu, I give you 500 dollars to buy toilet paper. Another 500 for this month's air-conditioning fee. Make the air-conditioner cooler. Electricity is cheap. I paid it all. You want to die? You screw me up big time. What are you doing here? I come and let you kill me. Mouse, your tips let us win big money this time. -We won't kill you. -My tips? Right, the Fire Unicorn. No, I asked her to bet on The Intruder. Where's Yu? Won the horse race? -Manager Wu. -You are rich. -Save electricity is right. -Right. It's alright to use less toilet paper. We won't scratch our asses if we use less toilet paper. I'll go and entertain the customer. Why are you talking to me so nicely? I lower my voice because I am poor. Stop dreaming. Go outside and earn your hard-earned money. Yu, I'll look for you wherever you are. Why you come to my house so late? Your house? I thought this is my house. What are you doing? You killed that cushion. -Don't scare me. What are you doing here? -To watch TV. Racing World at 23:35 on Wednesday night. Bill Tung is the host. Five more minutes. You don't have TV in your house? I have. Is she gone nuts? She lost the bet.

You are my only friend. Don't you scare me. Why? I was beaten. I can't pay them the money that I owe, they want to kill me. Don't be afraid, I'll help you. It is hard to find a true friend. Tell me, why they want to kill you. The thing is, I have a sister friend. Her dad needs to have heart transplant, and her mom needs to have kidney transplant. Her sister needs to have lung transplant. I borrowed money from the loan shark. I can't pay when the money is due. They want to kill me to retrieve my heart, kidney and lung. So fierce. Okay, I'll write you a cheque. Why do you laugh? I have a cramp. Hello. Ngor, did Yu come and look for you? What's going on? That bitch took all our money to bet on a horse and lost. Now she disappears. If you see her let us know. Actually, they beated you and made you gone crazy. This world means nothing to you. Yeah. -How much is the cheese ball worth? -10 cents. -This apartment? -10 cents. -Your dad? -10 cents. -Your life? -10 cents. Right. This is one dollar and is good enough for you. You can pay back the loan shark with capital and interests. You want me to get kill? Want you to get kill? You don't deserve to live. You think of every excuse to swindle your sister's money. Now that you know it all, and you don't help me? Why don't you level with me earlier? I am ashamed. Every time I have to trouble you. I know you are good to me. And you are my only friend. Every time I come and ask you for money. I feel so terrible. Save it. You and I are good friends. I'll help you this time. How much? Thank you very much. 800 thousands. 800 thousands? You think this is nether bank notes? Please, for the sake of our friendship. Okay? I don't have that much money. You just said a true friend is hard to come by. I didn't know a friend is so expensive. Okay, for the sake of the friendship, you say how much. 5 thousand. What? 5 thousand? It was worth 15 thousand last time. How can you say that? Interest rate is up, and the dollars' worth is up too. Not five thousand, then how much? Okay, I'll not beg you. Don't stop me, I'll go and kill myself. Don't -I'll die in front of you. -Good.

You go to hell. I should be dead. I'm dead. No, if I die, the Yue will be all alone. No way, I kill her first then I'll commit suicide. I resolve to die. I'll tie my feet, you turn on the gas for me. Then come back hours later. By then even if I am not dead, I can't go out. Okay, I'll tie you up. You don't need to tie me at the back. Oh yes, because I am not going to use the gas.

Master Hung, the ghost I raised for you this time, is brought over from Malaysia. It's a female ghost. A female ghost? She was raped and killed. She was found pregnant after dead. It's one victim with two lives. She has greater grudge than any other ghosts. Her power is greater than any other ghosts. How will she obey me? You shed a drop of blood on the um every week. That's it. Why shed blood? Because she lives on blood. However, I went through hell when I tried to suduce her. You must remember to feed her. She is so fierce, will she out-power me? I have thought of that. I put her embryo separately If she doesn't obey you, you put it in the fire pot, and burn it with cinnabaria. You have the upper hand I am sure she'll listen to you. Brothers, we raise this ghost Our organization will have a smooth operation. Okay... However, There is no reason for us to share our profits with the rebel. Rebel? -Right, “Who? The police want to bust me for a long time But fail. So they send in an insider -An insider? Is it you? -who? Waste him. Why don't you jump? I can't, I'm too nervous.

Is it an of fence to enjoy the view? -Right, you come with me to give statement. -Why you bust me? -Will you keep quiet please. I am not going. Did you see what happened? I saw a woman push her down. I of course yell at them to stop. That woman fell down. Then she was committing suicide, and not enjoying the view then? No, it's murder. Are you sure you saw that woman pushed her down. I said yes. What I don't understand is why can't we find that woman's corpse. I just don't understand. I called her house but nobody answered. Nothing on her in the newspaper. Right, we better run, go home and get the passport. Officer, all my chickens in the henhouse is gone. What? All the chicks in the whore house is gone? Is it legal to run a whore house in Hong kong? Is it illegal to run a henhouse? You operate a whore house and dare to report to the police? No, not that kind of chicks. We have a farm house, they are chickens in a farm house. Officer. -What's the name of your farm house? -SoKee Yard -SoKee Yard -Scotland Yard? Scotland Yard? No... it's SoKee Yard. -We are from Scotland Yard -How Come? To see sergeant Wong. To report to duty. Turn right, room 101 Thanks. Officer, please make charges. Officer Wong, don't worry. Of course I am worried. These two guys are nasty bastards in Scotland Yard. They are lucky, nothing goes wrong so far. They are assigned to our precinct, We will have a tough time. Is that what you worry about? You don't want them hanging around? Ask them to do those itsy bitsy jobs. They won't bother you then. You make the arrangement. What kind of a person is this Sergeant Wong? An ass-hole. How do you know? You see, he has a shitty face. Right, he looks shittier than you are. He puts on air and read English Literature, dork. Bravo Bravo? I threw only on book. Just think of an excuse. Officer Wong, I think it's them. It's them all right. He's coming You must be the Scotland Yard's action heroes. Yes, Sir. What are you doing? Indirectly knock down a buffalo. To knock down a buffalo? Right, we are practising a long lost Chinese internal kung-fu. Is it funny? Why? It is funny because you say such an absurd thing. You don't believe then? Of course I don't believe. You think you are making a kung-fu movie? Police force will only believe scientific facts. Or else, why do we carry guns. It will be much better for us to go to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts. How can I make you to believe me? Okay, you hit me with you palm in the air, and see if I will die. I order to prove it to you, I have to offend you. Hit me. Don't hit a person, hit an object. An object? Okay. I hit his office. You see for yourself. Is it really that great? Of course. Don't look, ask somebody to clear the mess. Sir, we just report to duty, are there anything that we can help? No need, Chan, you see to it. The kung -fu they teach in Scotland Yard is so terrific. This is nothing. He has much better skill. -What skill? -It's called "shootin down an aeroplane.” -You practice for a long time? -sine I was 14. He believes. Kuen. Do you have any such cases that are unimportant, but looks complex and weird, and will never come up with any results? Just give me one. Officer Chan, who offended you? He didn't offend me, but he offended... Whom? Officer Wong. They are the two trouble makers from Scotland Yard. Have a light? No. Can I borrow? He is Trouble. I have a case. What case? A PR girl committed suicide last night. And got detained. -Suicide? This is a no good case. -Not exactly. Listen to me. An eye-witness saw a girl was about to push the victim, but she slipped and fell down herself. We arrived at the scene but couldn't find the body. This case is probably a murder case, But I think, one, the eye-witness saw a ghost. And two, the victim was obsessed by a ghost. This is one weird case. We treat it as a murder case. And they will never find the murderer. Okay. Passport? Why don't you let me know that you are coming? So as to let me clean up the place and wait for you. If we let you know, then you will split. Save your breath. Give us our money or your life. You try to bully me? I am also a street-smart girl, I have nothing but a life, take it. -We dare not -But our boss dares. Boss? What kind of boss? Street cleaner is called the boss. People from the Mainland are also called the boss. The Boss, fool. You are so cocky, you dare to go to see him in the restaurant? -Why not? I fear of no boss. -Then go. - I will. You will see what's gonna happened. He is my boss. Boss. -You are their boss? I... -What? Why with your head down? Are you shameful? No, I have a terrible headache. Boss, if you got things to do, just say it, and I'll do it. You just said you see no boss. Now you are so obedient. The boss is here, how can I say I see no boss. Right? Boss. Your head. Who do you think you are? Talking to me with your head down?? You are not used to it? I am used to it. Why don't we all drop our heads when talking. Are you fooling around? Head up. Hello, boss. Have I seen you before? What? You have seen me? Can't be. I remember. -I recognise you. -Right. You were the centre spread girl of Sporting House magazine. You? The Sporting House? Yes... I did. Boss, you have such sharp eyes to recognise me. Of course. You have no tits, how can you be the photo girl? Right. No tits is a rarity. Big boobs are plenty, it's a nice change to see tiny boobs. How come you didn't say? Right. You don't wash dirty laundry in public. I owe betting debts, so I pose for the magazine to repay the debts. I don't want flesh for debts. I want cash. Boss, we are all street-smart girls and guys. We know one who repays his debts is of superior class. One who doesn't owe any debts is of lower class. One who doesn't pay his debts is of no class. I might be penniless today, but I might get rich tomorrow. I always pay my debts. Problem is will you give me a way? What kind of way that you want? -What way? -Boss. Let me think. Sit. I failed. Later. What do you want? I am thinking... You don't need to think. You won't be able to pay in one lot. How about by instalments? Okay, 10 instalments. -10? That's too long. -5 instalments. Okay? 5 instalments. 5 instalments. Boss, give me some grace periods, I don't have that many customers.

Start paying the first instalment tomorrow night. That quick? This kind of thing, quicker the better. Good, what a decisive woman. No delay. You girls go with her to pick up her passport, just in case. Okay. -Sorry if I hurt you. -It's okay. Let's go. Howe, what about that thing? My stone urn. I let that chick slipped away, Boss. You let me down. Boss, I won't next time. Last night a girl committed suicide on the roof, but she didn't die. She's in the police station. I had sent someone to keep an eye on her. Words have it that she is still in custody. I suspect that she has something to do with the stone urn. I know what to do, Boss. You were so cocky but then you turned chicken when you got there. You were so scared that you were in tears. Shame on you. You got balls, but we are sisters, don't do that to me. Wait, we don't have sister like you. You are so cheap to pose for the Sporting House magazine. If you want to do it, do it with Penthouse or Playboy. Of course I know I could earn more money to pose for them. Who doesn't? You got to see what I've got. I have no bust no buttuck With no money and no figure. I look like a box, it's flat in front. There's only a straight line on the side, with no curves.

Let go. -Beat it. -Don't look. -Let's see it -don't. -Open it -Don't look. God damn it, you stash away so much money, and claim that you are broke. The money is not mine, don't take it. If it's not your money, then don't take it. -Give it back. -You have it. Give it back. That's a lot of money. Give them back. We take the surplus as interest. You don't leave me any money. Go to hell. Stop pulling my legs. You are not dead, are you? I was only joking. Don't die. -Why you pushed me? -Ridiculous. I didn't pushed you. -Who else then? You want us too beat you? -Bitch.

Now that we have money, we should think how to enjoy life. 13, 14, 15. -15th floor. -Let's go. Of course we are in a lucky streak and become phoenixes. Can't we become swans? Phoenix is chicken. Whatever. I think this one. -I have sore wrist. -Right. -Put away all the stuff Hurry. -Who is it? Police. Looking for the two girls that just went in. Shit. How come the police are here? -They must have tailed us. -What should we do? You go and hide. I'll play with them. Let's see some |ID. Come in. Thank you, old lady. What about the two girls that just went in? They are in the loo. They live here? No, they are my grand daughter's friends. Where's your grand daughter? She's out. Please sit down, I get tea for you. Soft drink will do. You always have tea and no soft drink. Situation different. Don't know if they put poison in tea. They can also drug you with soft drink, you fool. Slim chance. Look out, something wrong with this unit. How do you know? Feeling. I feel that you are not okay. No one knows what you are talking about. Such a small unit. What's wrong with it? Problem. That old lady went in so long to get tea. What's wrong? Officer, I am old, You nearly scare me to death. -You are?... -Me? I am the husband of that old woman who opened the door for you. Where's that old lady. You look for her? She's in the room. I go get her. Old woman, officer asks for you. -Can't be. -What? Are you trying to scare yourself? We saw that old lady went in and didn't come out. Perhaps she came out while we were talking. And you didn't realized. Can't be. Are you looking for my sister? -Who is it? -Down here. Who are you? I am the younger sister of my sister. You have to wait for a long time for my sister. I have to go to the toilet. You wait, I'll talk to you after shitting. Looks like this unit is weird. You think so too? -Shit. -What? That old lady said the girl went into the toilet. So this one... that one... Open up. Who's in there? If she doesn't open up, we'll kick down the door. Okay! What's wrong with you guys? You are so impolite, barging in here and watch an old woman going to the loo? Shame on you. You mother didn't teach you that? We see all right. -Does it hurt? -It hurts. -Does it hurt? - It hurts like hell. Granny, I am hungry. You got anything to eat? Grandma is in her room, I'll ask her to fix you something to eat. You just ate. You got worms or what? I take you to see the doctor. I don't want to see a doctor. It really hurts when he gives me an injection. Did you register as a voter? Why not? Remember to register. The Hong Kong Government needs your participation and opinions. Remember to go tomorrow. Sisters, today we'll teach you the etiquette of a PR girl. You need to sway your buttock when walking. You sway it the shakier the better. You need to shake your tits. Like this. You see these two guys are having a great time. Don't you agree? Oh God, Ghost! You don't wait for my sister? No, some other time. -Bye. -Hurry. -They are gone. -We fooled these two bastards. It's fun. They wet their pants. Hurry, go tell the boss that the murderer might be a ghost. I want to buy a house with a swimming pool. I want to have a chauffeur to drive me around in a Rolls-royce. -I also want... -We want nothing. We need to go to some place that nobody knows us. Right, but where can we go? We need to book a plane ticket, no matter where we are going. We need to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible. Let's go. Put away the stuffs first. Right. Honey, I'll come to your place tonight. You prepare chicken congee for me as a late night snack. Okay...that's it then. Hold on, give me a Kiss. See you. -Sir. -Sir. Sir, we... What's going on? It's you again? What kind of kung-fu you are practising this time? Ghost. We saw ghost. You saw ghost? You saw ghost movies one too many. No, it's real. We followed that girl to her friend's house. We went to the house but we didn't see the girl. Then we saw an old lady, she said the girl went into the toilet. Then the old lady disappeared. We saw an old man. He said the old lady went into her room The old man disappeared, then we saw a midget. That midget... That midget is a girl, a friend, a kid, went into the loo. The old lady said the girl went into the loo. We barged in saw no midget and no girl. Stop talking! I don't know what you are talking about. No, she was legco member at one time, then she became a TV artist, then a midget. Are you guys police officers or entertainment news reporters? If you want to quit, then go back to Scotland Yard and practice your kung-fu. No... Then get out. I already said so. We are having a rough time. I won't believe it if I didn't see it myself. You said so too. Anybody who is smart enough will say so. What should we do now? You ask me? I ask whom? Ask me. Did you see a ghost? Right. -What can we do? -Right. At my age, I have seen everything. -When I was... -Don't be nostalgic. Think of the present, what should we do? A ghost is afraid of red undies. -It can ward off any ghosts. -Really? Before you go, you wash your eyes with water boiled with pomelo leaves. You will see the ghost wherever it goes. -Really? -Really? Believe it or not, I already told you. You believe him? What else can we do if we do not believe him? Let's go. You slut denies that you have a lover. I didn't go to work to see what you are up to. Those who came and looked for you were guys. If one more guy come and look for you, I won't be kind to you, I'm telling you. Mr. I would like to ask... Ask you mum. How would my mum knows where she lives. It must be here. Where is it? We are well prepared this time. Pomelo leaves. Did you put on your red under? I did. Let's go. It's these two pigs again. He died so terrible. Freeze, show him what we got. You are scared? You ain't see nothing yet. Switch places. What are they doing? I don't think that they are gays. He has no response. We failed to ward off the ghost. Can't be. Uncle Chung said if we turn our butts to him, he'll disappear. You take me as a ghost? Attack. Go. I'll play along. I am done. -I make you lose you abode. -Thank you. I am done. I am going now... I am done. Succeed. Go search this place and see what we can find. She makes me to do video film. You are better than I am, making video film. I pose for the Jade pavilion. I am much worse, I pose for the porno magazine. We didn't realise Yue knows such evil ways. Not evil ways? She must have kept a ghost, or else we won't be possessed. Is Fairy Lady works all right. Of course, she specialises in ghost busting. You put on your red undies? Not only red undies, bras as well. -Nothing. -We search the whole house, nothing suspicious. Let's go... Go. No escape this time. Evil ghosts, are you scared? It will ward you off. Right, ward you off. -They think we are ghosts? -Really? Scared? You ain't see nothing yet. Right. -I can't take it no more. -I am done. Wrad you off. It worked. If it worked, then we get rid of them once and for all. Get rid of? How to? You forgot what Fairy Lady told us, we raped the ghost, until their power vanishes. Rape him. Okay, let's do that. -Don't rape us. Don't. -Get up. -Get in...what are you doing? -Please don't rape me. -Get in. -Don't rape me. -Don't do this to me. -If you knew of the outcome, then you shouldn't have treated us like this. Fatty, we attack him together. Okay, get up. Why don't you come along, the more the merrier. Okay, I am not afraid of you. -Don't rape me. -Get in. Bitch You are asking for it. Let's waste her tonight. With this money, we can split among ourselves. I feel good. Then let's go. Go... I feel good. Today is the happiest time in my life. You have more to come. You won't be able to sleep tonight. How do we celebrate? We'll celebrate on the plane. Brother Hung will find us. We don't feel safe if we are still in town. -They want to run? It is bad news. -You are chicken. Why are you so scared? We have this treasure, we won't even afraid of Rambo. Treasure. You think this is a fairy, or is it the evil spirit? You are evil. It is a fairy. Not only can it bring us money, it can also protect our lives. If it didn't possessed us the other day, we won't be able to beat the shit out of those bastards. Right, please bless us. No more talking, let's go home and pack. -See you at the airport tonight. -Okay. -I'll go now. -Hurry. -Don't be late. -I won't. Treasure grabbing. Murder. Right, The two gangs kill for one No, three gangs. Three? Right. We are the gang. We? We grab the treasure and kill them all. Good. Hello. Yue, how dare of you to reap the profit. Who is it? Brother Hung. What do you want? Nothing, I am telling you, I can let go of the money. But you still have something that belongs to me. What? I don't. Stop pretending. It's okay. You can take it. I can always get another one. But you won't be able to find another friend. -Yue, Help me. -Don't. -Ngor. -Help me, quick. -So...?7 -What do you want? Tomorrow evening, seven o'clock Shatin Wai Yip Industrial Building 18th floor Her life is in your hand. Where's the money and the urn? The same statement three times in a roll. What does it mean. It indicates that the female ghost was died of an affair. Probably rape and murder. But what is weird is that the statement implies Yin and Yang will join together. There's no way that the female ghost is a shemale. Would it be that she was MC/DC? No, unless she was pregnant. And she had a boy. That's a point. The case is getting complicated. The corpse in the back alley was also a female ghost. Take this urn and watch the girl. There might be surprises. Right, we might get laid again. Screw you. Follow her. Where is the urn? In the car. Take it. You open the door. I forgot to take the key. What can we do? Anybody here? I am here. Yue, help me. Ngor. What's up? Are you afraid? Now you are scared. You bitch. How dare you. You steal from me? I am not afraid. I have this thing and I am not afraid of you. You let my friend go. Or I'll use this thing to deal with you. To deal with me? You deal with me? I know you'll do this. Give me the urn. Boss, the urn. The little ghost inside this urn, is the son of that female ghost in your urn. If she dares to do anything, I'll cast it into the pot and burn it with cinnabar. Do you really think that she'll listen to you and deal with me? I can't let him know that this urn is a fake one. I got to pretend that it is real. Bullshit, you take your father's um and said that this is her son's. Why don't you admit that she's your grandma. You are nuts. Teach him a lesson. -Teach me a lesson? -What are you doing? You beat them for me. Do you hear? Beat them. I already told you it won't work. You shit-eating dog, go eat shit. Boss, the urn works. Look, the dog is eating shit over there. You go eat shit. She says I am a shit-eating dog, and not the dog. You wise up. You are useless, you can't get it opened. Go away, let me do it. You are useless. It worked, didn't it? Why you use your head and the fist? The skull is the hardest part in human body. Not the teeth? You try and use your teeth then. It's too dangerous, I better not. This time I'll kill you two bastards. Don't push me. Or I'll break it. Now you act wildly. Okay, you let her go first. No way, I'll tell you. You give me the urn, I'll deliver her. Or I'll waste her. -And see if you can get out of here alive. -Don't Okay, let's exchange. Go. Shit, what now? -You give me the urn, and I'll let her go. -Give him... Should I give him the fake one? Looks like they are doing business. Definitely. Looks like she is holding an urn. The urn is with us, what are they exchanging? Help me. Okay, We'll exchange at the same time. 1, 2, 3. Run. Where're you going? Where are you two going? With these two urns, We can do whatever we want. What do you want? What do I want? Give it to me, so clumsy. -Kill them both. -Okay, boss. -What are you doing? -Kill them both. I am talking to the urn. Step aside. Kill them. No, please don't kill us. What are you doing? Fake dead. You have to shed blood on it to gain it's power. Try it. What are you looking at? You bugger off. That was close. Who is it? -Police. Take it easy. -Police? I don't care if you are Superman! Kill him. Why don't you go. I thought you are talking to the urn. Go fuck yourself. Every time I have to use the um, Why should I keep you around? Be a bit smart, kill him. -Kill him. -Charlie, push. Superman gives us strength. -Hit the Bull. -Shoot down the plane. Are they also raising a ghost? Cannot be. It's a fake. Bitch, you fool me. Listen, you female ghost, if you play tricks with me, I'll burn your son. Why didn't it work? Try again. -Hit the bull -Shoot the plane. Nothing happens. Draw the gun. Freeze, or I'll shoot. Howe, give me the urn. Give it to me. Don't move. Boss. -Give me the syringe, spray on it. -Boss. How dare you are, hit the bull. You two fight between yourself. Sorry, it's not my fault. I don't want to do this, forgive me. How come? Here it goes again. How come? Don't. How come I will raise my ass? Stop. Are you all right? I want you two to draw the guns. No. Shit. Be careful of my head, I got brains in there. You watch out for my happiest and most cherish part. Don't shoot or it will be game over. The two policemen will die soon. What to do? We can't escape. We risk it one more time. You go save the pigs and I'll take the um. Don't move your finger, or it will be over. Where's my urn? She took my umn. Ridiculous. Strangle them to death. I forgot to give it blood. Get me back the urn. Quick. Go after her. Hurry. Who tripped me? Where's the um? It's gone. You do... Where're you going? Catch. Let me. Sorry, I don't want it this way. Forgive me. What's going on? Give me my son. That little urn. What are you looking at? You kill them all for me, and I'll give you your son. All of you have to die. Run -Boss -Block her. Hurry. She's coming. Take it off. It worked. What now? Take off your pants. All of you, take off your pants and face her. Come on, I am not afraid of you. Facing her. She's not afraid. Give me my son. -It's useless, think of something else. -Something else? Throw at her. Run that way. Give me my son. Don't come near. Or I'll burn your son to death. I am so scared. You are scared, then you Kkill the pigs and the girls for me. You have no right to bargain with me. Give me my son. Run. What should we do? How would I know? Fight with her If we won, we might survive. -Right. -Correct. You two take off your undies and fight with her. -What? Take off the under? -Take it off. -Take it off. -No way. -I'll help you. -Take it off? -Let's do it. -Take it off. No need for you to help us. Don't come over. God of Guan is here. Come on over. -She dares not to come. -Good You are so clumsy. Who else can protect you this time? Help. Help. Ward you off. It works. Hit her. It's me. Where is it? -Where's the ghost? -It's gone. I hit you hand, and may you have a hairy hand. I hit your mouth, and may you breathless. You hit the ghost or the trouble maker? Whatever, it's urgent. Go to hell... Hit her. Drop dead. -Drop dead. -Hit her. Drop dead. Out of the way. Do you think the ghost is dead? She is half dead for sure. Shit, where's my little urn? Howe. Where're you going? You bastard raise a sorry ass ghost. You are asking for trouble. Hit him. Stop it, I gotta find the little urn first. If Howe shed blood on it, then it means big trouble. What will happened? What do you know. That female ghosts lives on blood. The Master says, We can only let her have blood once a week. If Howe shed blood on the little urn, and let the ghost comes around, the shit will hit the fan I don't understand what's with the little urn. That little ghost died an embryo. It was united with the female ghost. If we feed the little ghost with blood, we are feeding her. So we have to get rid of the little ghost. Sounds reasonable. -Of course. -Is it really that magical? I am not bullshitting you. Go find Howe quick. -What's going on -Hold it. What's wrong? We don't feel safe if we are not stick with you. Right. You stay here and watch over the female ghost. What? I watch over the ghost? You go find Howe and get back the urn then. Of course it's you. Who else could it be? Let's go. It hurts. I have to stick with this thing. It is better to have the little urn, even though I lost the big one. I wonder if it's as powerful as the big one. What takes them so long? Left, right, left, right... No response? Is it still hungry? Feed it again. Help, open up Why can't it open? Help me, that ghost comes around. -Listen. -Help, open up. Do you hear? What's going on. Sounds like it's Yue. No. You didn't hear? I'll go and take a look. Woman is paranoid and troublesome. Get me out...open up. That ghost survives. Help... get me out quick. Help. Get me out. -Yue, what's going on? -Help. Quick, help me. -Oh no. -Help. I'm coming. Help me, hurry. The door is locked, can't open. Think of something. Help me, hurry. I am thinking. Break it loose. No response. The little ghost sure have a big appetite. Don't you know that it means big trouble if you drop blood in it. -Big trouble? -Of course. I don't know that. You don't know if I hit you. You dropped so much blood in it, there must be big trouble downstairs. She's coming. -Found it -Hurry. Bloody hell. Hurry. -What's wrong? -That ghost survives. Can't open the door. Do you have a key? -Do you have a key? - I have. Bloody hell. -Don't pull, I can't open it. -Hurry. Got it. Open it up and save Yue. It's open. Get hold of him. Run. Give me my son. -Your son is here. -Give me my son. Give me my son. I don't want it, you have it. Why give it to me,? I'll give you. I don't want it. Shit, it's bleeding. Her belly will swell up if you drop blood into the urn. I give it back to you. We'll donate blood together. Donate blood? Her belly will swell up if you drop blood into the urn. We drop blood together until she busts her belly. Hold on, I have a knife. I'll donate the first blood. I cut the wrong hand, it's hurt hand Oh god. Hurry, donate blood. Hurry. - It hurts. -Drip down together. -Catch. -Pass. Catch. It's our turn. -Drop blood. -Hurry. Catch. Speed it up. Drip down together. Good. More. Her belly is swollen.

I have waited for you for ten years. At long last you fell into my hand. You two take this four eyes into the car, -and clean up the mess. -Yes sir. I take this guy and the girls. Let's go. I'll go. We have to go with him, shit. Get in. You are so clumsy. Don't touch me. Get in. Close the door. Don't be ridiculous! There are no ghost. Ask your two officers if you don't believe us. -Ask your horse. -Yeah. They are the crazy horses, and the black sheeps of the police force. They have been in Scotland for years, and mingle with the "ghost" every day. They don't know what human beings are, they don't know for sure. -Ask him, he saw that too. -Right. You ask an vicious, evil doing killer, Do you really think that, we can trust his words? If 1 tell you that I operate gambling stalls, whore houses, and go drug trafficking would you believe me? I believe you With your words I can put you away for years. Why shouldn't I believe you? If I tell you there are ghost in this world, will you believe me? No. The voice sounds very familiar. Very familiar. Don't be afraid, and stop fooling around. Don't think that you don't have to go to jail if you are gay. No, sir... -That's the voice of the female ghost. -Right. You act as if you are crazy if not gay. -He is not. -He isn't. -I am going to faint. -So am | You can also play magic. -With you eyes emitting electricity. -No. -You think you are an actress. -No. Even if you are, I am insulated.

I'll breast feed you. -Come. -No... -I don't want milk. -What? You don't like? No, sister just breast fed me. I'm full. You... I have enough for him. Since you are so nice to my son, then I let them to have a quick death. -No, I want to play. -Why? To play what? Take them to the cliff and hit them dead. It's fun. Save the troubles. -Strangle them to death. -No. Quiet. Yue is letting her on. -No, I want to play... -Okay you be good. We'll lock them in the car. Okay? -Get in quick. -Get in. Lock up. I'll drive.
