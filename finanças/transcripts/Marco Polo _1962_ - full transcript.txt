Oh, Venice, Venice. My heart beats when I leave you. It was probably the thought of Marco Polo, on the day when r. 1270 he sailed from there. The reason for its mission, as a messenger of Western civilization, he would have a trip to the heavenly realm. But under the guise, the truth was different. Marco Polo was very happy to be leaving. At that historical time, women were a big problem. And for Marc it reached a critical point. Very critical. His future wife was waiting for him in San Marcos Square. "My dear, I sail to distant lands." "I wish you all the best, I will never forget you." "Marco." I knew about the usefulness of carrier pigeons. God. Who sends? Marietta, come hear it. What is it? "" I kiss and on the mouth. Signed by M.P. "". M.P. Mòa? Who had the audacity...? Who is M.P.? I don't know, I don't know anyone. I spent the whole day at home without seeing anyone. M.P. M.P. he sends me a kiss. Well, at least I have one pigeon. But pigeons can also be wrong and sometimes they don't even fly. What now? He's not coming anymore. It will all end once. At least one word. Sign. Marco, my Marco. So it happened with this one. True to his reputation, so Marco Polo could indulge in undisturbed love games in higher society. I won't leave and leave. Your heart is made of stone, and you are also laughing at my pain. I will avenge all the women you deceived! But why, Fatima? I suffer as well. Why are you treating me like that? Don't move! Do not touch me! You don't know what love or pain is. You have a snake look. Vipers. Monster. Monster. But I know one thing. That my heart is broken. Look at me. My darling, forgive me. Ok i forgive you though she made me suffer and doubted me. Occasional stops were understandable especially from the point of view to the hardships of this journey. What do they want to do with him? He is tormented by tortureers for entering the harem. Do the torture want him? He deserves a reward. Who could blame him? Only Ester, the favorite. She's been in charge here lately. I need a young Chinese. For what? To have a guide on my way to China. The one who was convicted of entering the harem. Tell me how I can save him. Foreigner, it will not be difficult for you. Just a kiss. Sir. Did you have problems with that? You don't have to remind me, it didn't cost me anything. -What is it? -Great Wall of China, sir. What is it for? It was built by the Chinese emperors to protect against the Mongol attack. Didn't they know to do something more useful for protection? There is nothing more useful that would protect the land surrounding your house, sir. I'm not home based, Chao Lin. I prefer business. Wasn't it built to protect the virtue of your women? I will tell everyone that he meant nothing to Marc Polo. -Are they going hunting? -No, catch fish. -On the falcons? -They're cormorants. They go to the river with them. They fish for their master, for which he leaves some smaller pieces. Brilliant. Hello, how far is it to Beijing? One day and one night trip, but it is better not to travel at night. And this is the road to Beijing? To Beijing? Yes. You're a good guide, Chao Lin. Thank you. As is the case with everyone whose stories are part of history, there were various causes and reasons for his journey. But as soon as his real motives were revealed… Historians have denied that a woman was behind it. What is it? Ugly Chinese music, sir. It will be better not to notice them. Fear is the enemy of curiosity. See? -What did I say? -Beautiful spectacle. I would almost miss her. Do you want to stop? -We should go. -No, wait. What do you think will win? The one with the hair on his helmet. -One million? -One million. He did well. Look at those two. Help! Help! Help! So come on, get up, because you'll get your clothes dirty. Has anyone ever told you that you are very pretty? Warning! Do not panic. -I'll take you to your guides. -My guide. -Everyone will be dead. -No, I don't think so. I couldn't drive the bandits alone. Stranger, you speak very boldly. It's more dangerous to be with you than with bandits. Besides, I can walk alone. All right, go ahead. So jump up and don't worry. It's here! I told you he would set her free. Why didn't you come to my aid? We had to face the others. What don't deserve a reward? Let's go fast. The road is long. A moment. Isn't it too late? Forward. Wait. You can also spend the night here. When in doubt about what to do, so night is a great advisor. Lift up! Shameless. The monastery. The only quiet place for the night. My father told me that the Great Buddha Monastery was an oasis of peace. And that's him. My name is Marco, son of Nicola Polo. I'm asking you for shelter tonight. You are welcome in our monastery. You can leave the horses in the stable. They also get hay there. -Go in. -Thank you. I was familiar with your father on the occasion of his first trip. It's for me, he knows you too. My father and uncle stayed in Tibet. And I went to Beijing to greet the Great Khan. Don't worry, stranger. Here you are among friends. All brave men are my friends. Thank you. I would be your friend if you weren't a bandit leader. My name is Cudaj and I am the nephew of the Great Khan. Are you Cudaj? I've heard of you before. What am I a bandit? No, I heard you rebelled against your Lord. Your tongue is as fast as your sword. Join us. I'm sure I'd disappoint you. In my heart I am a man of peace. -I want him too. -Really? What about your lambs? I love and respect the Great Khan. However, I hate anyone who abuses his age and oppresses the people. Take a good look at those bandits. The lambs became wolves because of injustice. Get up! Get up! Who is it? We caught him in the rice fields. This is the courier of the Great Khan, someone must have betrayed us. Gather the men, we must leave immediately. Come on, everyone on horseback! What should we do with it? He will either lose his head or join us. You have an army of volunteers. I'm sorry, but don't you want to join us? Not. Come on, Marco Polo. Something tells me we'll meet again. Sir, the only safe place is in Beijing. We leave at dawn. If you want to go to Beijing, send a message to the Great Khan. My horse is very fast, he would get there before the messenger. One hundred men is more than one. I do not understand. The Grand Khan established a postal service in the empire. Messages are transmitted by thousands of messengers. How's Cudaj's prisoner? -Yes. -The relay system. Good idea. Your servant can send a message to the post office. Lin Chao, write to the Great Khan that we want to enter his service. - Do you and I have to serve the Great Khan? -Yes. It's like a spa with a tiger. Choí písa. This is chaos, a disaster. Brothers against brothers, this is a civil war. They didn't even care about my daughter. Indeed, without the alien's intervention, I would have been dead. Are you sure he was a warrior? He handled the sword like a samurai. He is tall, agile. He has vivid blue eyes. A real knight. We can thank Cudaja for betraying all this. Princess rescued by a noble alien, blue-eyed warrior. Father… my heart tells me that Cudaj and still loves. Me too. But what he did to you silenced my feelings. Your cousin rebelled against my authority. He even dared to raise his weapons. Why are you looking at me like that? I will never go against you. You are the best person in the world. I will always be with you. The future of a beautiful girl like you not to spend your life with an old man. If I and I should leave for a wedding, I would never get married. It's a must, leave me. Asia's most powerful ruler, he asks me and my wife. The candidate for your hand is already in Beijing. I apologize for blaming you, sir. You never bother me, Mongka. -I was probably... -It must be an urgent matter when the first minister arrives, he will announce it in person. I received this message from Nico Polo's son. He has come to Beijing and wishes you would receive him. You are my precious collaborator, Mongka. You save me from reading the annoying news that is directed against me. My humble mission is to rid you of as many unpleasant tasks as possible. What do you say about Marco Polo? Our country seems to be attracting foreigners, just as flowers attract bees. First the mysterious blue-eyed stranger and now, a merchant from the West. Tell Nico Polo's son that I will accept him and bring him to the palace. No, Marco. Sir, don't laugh. It's not funny, it's a sacred ceremony. -Aren't they cocoons? -Not. Just come, come closer. Quality goods, good, guaranteed, just look. Did you see? Yes. How much does it cost? 700 yen. I can give you a hundred. Not. I can't for that price. Give me 200. We are both traders. 150. Give it to me now. All right, now. -Great. -What is it? -Do you want spending? -Yes. What's that supposed to be? The Grand Khan introduced a new currency. Wait, I gave you gold and you give me the paper. If I gave you the paper now, would you give me the gold? Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. You give me the gold back. Come on, give me the baby back. Fast fast. -What do they eat? -It smells good. Spicy Chinese eggs preserved underground. -I'll be at least 30 years old. -30 years? So it went through my hunger. Let's go to my Aunt Balen, this is the best cook in the world. -Where is the? -There. Poïme. Welcome, stranger, welcome. It's a great time. -Please pass. -There is. This is my aunt's inn. She will feel honored to have such a barefoot. Let's hope so. Lin Chao! -Aunty Balena! -Lin-Chao! Little Chao Lin, hug me. You will eat well here, you will see. This is Marco Polo. He came from Venice. -Where is Venice? -From from here. If you are from such a distance, you will surely be tired. Not as tired as he was rather hungry. Same. Then come with me. I'll serve you right away. Thank you. So, I picked soup from swallow's nests for you, shark fins and fried grasshoppers. -Graps? -Yes Yes. No, I prefer vegetable soup. No, no, this is better. Are those worms? But no. This is made from wheat flour. These are spaghetti. -They're very good. -And they're very healthy. Are these spaghetti ready for cooking? -Yes, for cooking. -I'll take a few to Italy. However, they do not look like the ones I tasted. Health toast from the host. Don't move, stay in your places! What does that mean? What are you looking for in my inn? Ah, I get it. -Huo, bring the wine. -We don't want wine. You must pay the Great Khan tax for the salt. Daò za so¾? But what does the Great Khan want, including our blood? What else do you want to take from us? What do we have left then? I gave you the last yen. -What more do you want? -It turned on. -Or we'll take your divans away from you. -You leeches! -That you're not ashamed! -Get everything. Get out. You too, dos was food. -I didn't invite me here. -Give it to me. Leave me alone. -Give it to me! -Hands off! So, hurry up, move! You, come on! Where are the rebels? Phone call! -Where are they hiding? -I'll never tell you. Who supports the Manchurians in revolt? Call, you bastard! One day you will be sorry that you are tortured defenseless people. Run as soon as possible if you want to keep your head on your neck. Leave him. Leave him! I told you to keep him like that. Here and we will learn obedience. So forward, rebel. Attack! You already have one debt with me. I can connect another. Be careful, the soldiers are coming here again. The name of Marco Polo is written on the facade. Where is the? And I ask, what do you want from Marco Polo? Answer! Where is Marco Polo? He was arrested just before you came here, gentlemen. - Arrested? -Yes. Reverend Guard. Look at the prison! I appreciate what you did. I didn't do anything. You're the brave one. Marco Polo. K¾ud. Is there anything else unsettled? Not anymore. A great khan and awaits in the palace. Marco Polo, son of Nicola from Venice, is here. Let him in. Father, this is the man who saved me. Greetings, Great Khan. You too, princess. Lovely like an evening breeze in the desert. My father Nicolo and my uncle Mateo send greetings to you. They both sent me forward to your lavish court. Welcome, Marco. We are glad to welcome a son from such faithful friends. I ordered you to be rewarded with Marco Polo, for saving my daughter from a bandit attack. As First Minister, my task is to carry out the will of my Lord. What reward do you want? My little merits have already been rewarded And with your smile, Princess. You've come such a long way just to export western gallant? Each country exports what it has the most. But are you at risk of not making a profit? Princess smile, outweighs any risk. My father and my uncle bring you a gift from the pope. What for a gift? I don't know, it's in a chest that only you can open. He accepts the gift of the supreme leader of the Christian church, is a big cou for me. I'll send the couriers now, with an order for our friends to have an escort. Our paths are still not safe. But tell me, Marco. What was most unexpected for you on your trip to China? A punch to the head from your guard. He will pay for this insult, I give you my word. Don't worry, sir, he's already paid. -Please forgive us for this mistake. -It's sorry. I move among ordinary people and I have understood many things. They are only poor and slaves. People were not born in chains. Marco Polo. Tell us about your country. Your father told us about different curiosities. Is it still forbidden for me to have more than one wife in your country? Yes, we can only have one wife. Sometimes the one is too much. Why? Do you already have a wife? No, my wife needs a home and I'm just a tramp. If you want, you can choose one. As you can see, they are all nice, friendly and born. They are all beautiful. If I had one choice, I would offend others. You are young but wise. Accept our hospitality. I have been instructed to satisfy all your desires. Let me escort you to your room. Even a wise man can confuse a door. And the blind man can see clearly again. Close the door, the sun blinds me. Such disruption deserves contempt. Chang, father of lanterns, Can you tell me which room the young stranger is? Don't release falcons unless you want to hunt a hare. This is his lantern, as you can see, it's green. -It's a dragon room. -But his room. It's at the behest of Mongku. The light also burns at Mongku's command. I say too much. My tongue is like a tiger. If I don't handcuff him, he'll eat me. I want your opinion on a torture instrument. - Have you seen anything like this? -Not. That's what I invented, to fight the excess of wisdom. The executioner just opens this, so that the blade… slowly decreases towards a tied convict… she will anoint herself with him before she begins to be cut and crushed. Yes, it's a nice toy, although a little simple. In my opinion, it could be improved. I'll look into it. Yes. I already have it. I need a bamboo stick for that. Were you already in the grave? It will be just a small experiment. Tell me if you're scared? Thank you. When you place this club on a smart guy so when breathing, the stick will move up and down. A moment. It is now in focus. I will attach the mallet to the gear blade. With each up and down movement, the pinion will move it forward. And with each breath, it drops a little lower. Below. Below. The convict's torments end with death. Brilliant. -And a little more humane. -Thank you. I'll find a way to get you back soon. Have mercy on me. Have mercy on me, stranger. Save me one more time. In the name of his God, a stranger. Help me. Help me. Do you know this worm? Did I meet him during my stay in your prison? So he has to pay you his debt. Yes. You yourself open his door to freedom. -He's definitely free. -That's very explicit. There is no need to put a hard weight on a good drum. But hit the skin of others with a stick. I traded your lantern for a lantern, a stranger. This palace is a maze and is easy to get lost. Every time you see a green lantern, you can go ahead. The road is safe. Who do you serve? Ask the golden eagle. Princess, the stranger is on the balcony. Chao Lin, my coat. Please do not leave without lying in the neighborhood. Why are you always scared? If you want to talk to the princess, so you try the machine you perfected yourself. No machine can hold an Italian lover. I do not need it. Bad, very bad. What is it? Don't cry. You'll be my snake right away. Please, I would like to alone. You must be very satisfied, Marco. You are always where someone needs you. Not always. I've only been lucky since I saw you. When a man in Venice applies for a prostitute, so it will appeal to her like you my little pink bud. -Púèik? -Yes, buddy. Not a single flower has opened like you yet. Although it is spring and everything around is blooming. What sweet words. -But I can't listen to them. -Why? Are you worried that your snake can read the scriptures? Yes. Of all the secrets, we trust the snakes. Even with the name of the person we want to marry. I don't know yet who they will choose, but it will probably be some prince from a distant land. Not. I do not know. Mongka? I don't want to think of Mongka now. I'm glad you're here. Can I confide a secret to your snake? Mountains that touch the sky endless deserts that made me feel that I'm the first person to see… fairytale cities arising from nothing. My eyes are before such wonders, asked the question whether I travel at all or just dream. And nostalgia has never overcome you behind your hometown? Yes. I remember when I saw your fishermen hunting, that they use one oar like our gondoliers. -Then my eyes became wet. -Young sentimentality. Regardless of are our people different from yours? They are more sensible and calmer, we are your exact opposite, we are never silent. You can express happiness and sadness in silence. Flooded noiseless river, it can be much scarier than the raging sea. However, the ruler must hold the rudder firmly in his hands. -Using oppression and torture? -Yes, if necessary. It's easy to abuse power. Do you think? In addition, there is cholera and famine and Cudaj incites resistance in Manchuria. We sent troops to destroy the enemy. I'm sorry, sir, but on my way across China, I have seen that the problem is famine. You have not seen the greatest evil, you do not know Cudaj. I met a stranger and he seemed fair and reasonable to me. He spoke of you with the greatest love. He fights slavery, not the Great Khan. Father, Marco Polo's speech is an echo of my words. This war will bring us only the dead and the demons of hunger will spread their wings even more over China. Why don't you reconcile with Cudaj? I'm thinking about it. -Listen, Mongka. -I guessed your sensible suggestion. We'll send our barefoot to see Cudaj to talk to him. Its qualities and eloquence are certainly a good sign for mission success. Wait. I am honored by your trust, but it will be better to talk about it tomorrow. First of all, I have to consult with my pillow first. Good night. Take this sir, it will make you warmer. I won't need it. Venice has a humid climate but hot. You will not go to hot Venice, but to cold Manchuria. To Manchuria? -Do you think I'm going to Manchuria? -You said that... I said I had to consult with the pillow first, if this can be called a pillow. Besides, she looks so... Who is she? Princess. I know this language of views very well. He will want to reward me. All women are the same in pretending reasons. Yes, but she's a princess and that's something else. I bet before this burns out, will the princess call me and offer me one million? When it comes down to it, why not three million. Do you think he'll make another one? The princess is not anyone. What are you waiting for? Open the doors. Marco Polo, the princess asks you to visit her. How many times have I told you not to bet, son? You asked me to come, your request is an order to me. I wanted to tell you how grateful I am to you. Come closer, stranger. Same. My God, in Venice we usually talk a little bit before. Are you talking? But why? Well, I don't know the local customs. It is our custom to protect those who defend us. -I want to give you this amulet. -Amulet? -Don't you want him? -Yes of course. I don't want anything else. Come on, Marco Polo. With this, the gods will protect you. At the end of the journey, hand it over to Cudaj. Thank you. How nice. Beautiful and heavy. Gold from Canton and jadeite from Kataia, if I'm not mistaken. I trust you, Marco. Have faith and pass it on to Cudaj. It will protect you. -Okay, that's just the point. -Marco. Look, princess. I wanted something from you, just for me. Odo mòa? Talk and I will try to satisfy you. Okay, but I'm not asking much. -Only one kiss? -And what is it? A kiss. As a sign of devotion. This… is in memory. It must be held firmly in your hand. This is for a dream without waking up. And this, is a gift of love. I'm sorry, I didn't know you had an audience here. I would give those kisses to the whole society. Now I have no choice and I have to go. Marco. Would you leave without saying goodbye? Goodbye, princess. Happy journey. -Mr. -Yes. Don't talk to me, shut up and pay off your debt. Chao Lin. Chao Lin, are you hurt? Where, where? I do not know. There's no blood flowing in my veins. Where is the? Come and don't worry. You saved my life. I'm canceling your debt of 6 million. How come the arrow didn't cross? Prevention is always better than a wire basket. Please, sir, let's go. -Let's leave this country. -It seems to me... Please, there is nothing heroic about this. -So he's going back to Beijing. -Yeah, really? Mongka will destroy me. No, he'll be glad to know I'm dead. Tell him I fell into Cudaj's trap. What about me, what should I say? Tell him you fainted with fear and that and they spared. -Do you think they'll believe me? -Of course they'll believe you. You're a hero, but only I know. They were sent by the gods themselves to gnaw the bones. Who will know it's not me? Poor Marco Polo. Listen, only the princess can know I'm still alive. -Is that clear to you? -Why, are you in love? Can I and will he ask for something? -Choi, go to Beijing. -Sir, we bet. I don't need a game about your stuff, go! Your singing is raining with joy, but my dear, I received a sad message which deeply worried me. Unfortunately, princess. -Should I share your grief? -I'd rather save that, but you too found love in our Venetian friend. Is he dead? He fell in a heroic direction against a strong enemy. We only found this, on one gnawed corpse from vultures. I gave it to him myself. I can't believe my friend the poor stranger. Poor guy. I hate to see your tears. Haio, run her. There will be a celebration in his time tonight. He must look happy and happy in front of the guests. -Did I cry convincingly? -Yes. I was dying to tell my father that Marco was alive and that it was not the rebels who attacked him, but the hypocrite Mongka. Are you sure Chao Lin was telling the truth? -He always tells me the truth. -How do you know? Ah, so you and Chao Lin...? If he wants a drink, he has to get his feet wet. He waits under a peach every night, to one who never comes. Your servant is as weary as a llama; which has passed through thousands of hills. I can't run from my mind. Although my body wants to move on, the rebellious spirit will always turn him away like a flag waving against the wind. Tell me, sir, there really is a princess or is it just the product of your dreams? I would also challenge black demons and fire dragons to a duel, just to reach her. I feel like a month tonight will witness our happiness, That's where we entrust the snake the secret of our love. Maybe black demons whether fire dragons will try to destroy us. They're coming! We will fly like two doves with only one wing. We will be like two cherries that have grown from one stem. Whether we die in the air or we die on the ground, our love will live forever. Sir. Sir, I'm here. Once your dream comes true, your humble servant will no longer be important. Whose fault will it be? This August while you sneak up on your loved one, will reveal you with its light. Always watch the green lanterns and avoid inconveniences. Beloved. Marco. Poï. -What is it? -One kiss. One more. Dear, we are on the run… and now this is not the most appropriate. Sir. Sir. Forgive my humble advice. Wouldn't it be better to put it off until tomorrow? -The ship is full of guards. -Yes, but it won't be a problem for you. Yes sir. You didn't laugh anymore when I kissed. But, what happens after a kiss? What happens next? What's going on after the kiss? I'll explain later, come on. Nobody will find you here. When Mongka ends the persecution, you will be able to leave. But remember that the princess is sacred. How can you cut off a rose if you are a slave to its scent? Have you become a poet? I would try to be Chinese and like her. What is it? This monk pilgrim is entertained with magic dust. What is it, where did you find it? I got it from a certain Tai Fu, a strange man. He is an astrologer, alchemist and lives in the mountains. We have to check the whole city, without exception, and suspects also torture, only then will we know who kidnapped the princess last night. I don't want my daughter back either by violence or torture. Such leniency would be suspicious. It would be too easy to assure my men without revealing it. That was your idea, he wouldn't betray me. How dare you? You're crazy, Mongka. Hold him. Hold him. I will no longer obey you. Take him away. You are my prisoner. I'm taking over the government, I'm getting married to your daughter and I will thus become your rightful successor. Call your master. I'm sure Tai Fu will tell me his secret. Marco. What's going on? Why those tears? Why did you call me? Please don't disguise yourself. I know you want to leave. I talked to the monks. Right now we can be together. Why did you force me to run away with you? I have to leave, Amurray, but I'll be back soon. I'm going to visit a man who stole light from the stars. Don't leave me now. If you really have to go, please take me with you. It's very risky. We're going to sell the stardust to the people, Amurray. We will be very rich, the stars are priceless. I was born in wealth, but it only brought me boring moments. -I'm happy with you, with your love. -Listen. You want to leave your heritage and replace it with love. The princess will and will find and the princess will follow. You trust me. Remember, no survivors, no witnesses. This is Mongka, fast, fast. How dare you not know who I am? Darling. Darling. Kiss Me. Farewell. Goodbye. No offense, stranger. Confucius said, "One hundred eyes will not protect you in front of one curious ". How did you hear about me? I went a long way to seeing Tai Fu. A friend sent me here. Who sent? A monk pilgrim from the Monastery of the Great Buddha. He's a respectable friend, but naive and too cunning. I saw your magic dust. And what do you need it for? I am a traveling buyer and I intend to start a thriving business. It occurred to me to make a colored fire out of dust, as they do in Venice with glass. -Colorful? -Yes, make a fire in the shape of stars, cascades with peacock colors. They will come from all corners of China to see your fire. Wait a minute, because it makes my head spin. If we connect our minds, you will become famous. What about you? I will only be rich. A rich man is a dragon and a poor worm. What would you like, a dragon or a worm? Don't ask me stupid questions. I would like a dragon. We must find our master. When now? Sir! Poï. What do you smell like? Now we have to wait until dark. I can't wait, let's try it now. -It could be dangerous. -Now, now! Okay, now. We are friends, Marco Polo, but I will never tell you what I made the dust from. It can cause death. Let his power serve, only to illuminate the sky with new stars. Do you know what I like most about it? The excitement of the unpredictable. How we send these colored stars from us to the stars. What are you doing, exorcism? No, it's just a precaution. Wisdom of Italy and now hide. -Why? -I'm igniting a fuse. Sir! Poï. Sir! -We could be satisfied. -Are you expect a visit? Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Only this weapon can multiply your strength, Cudaj. From the mouth of this ingenuity, not only light will gush forth, but also a fiery monster that feeds projectiles. You will free your people from Mongka's will forever. And who will give us the dust to destroy his army? Tai Fu, if you can convince him. I don't like listening to death. I prefer to hear about freedom and peace. I'll give you dust Cudaj, but only the amount needed, to restore justice to this country. We will have to cut down trees to construct these intentions. Wood is useless, they must be made of metal. -You have to find him somewhere. -Where? Each house has a bronze bell. Ask them to give them to you. Then give them to melt and build weapons. That's enough. Leave it. Is it already? Yes. Forward! I will not take it at any cost. Your words will destroy your father's heart. I will not sign a decree about our wedding. The great khan is too wise not to approve this wedding. The line between hatred and love is very thin. Time, fear and habit work miracles. I hate a, Mongka. I'm looking for you. Beijing is a cross over the hill. -Will it work? -I think yes. -Mr. -Thanks, Chao Lin, do you want to? Many armed riders are coming and bring in some artifacts with hollow holes. -Probably to demolish the walls. -Give the reinforced gates. Move the best archers to the most vulnerable bastions. Let the Mongol cavalry be ready to attack. We welcome Cudaja and his chamraï as they should. -What about the Great Khan? -Full orders! Now I rule in Beijing. Choï! Be careful, be careful. Slowly, it's dangerous, you understand? Invited. I'm going to the town. The flare will signal the attack. Why are you taking such a risk, Marco? You'll get to Beijing, but you won't leave? I have an appointment, a lady is waiting for me. -Be careful, Marco. -Be worry-free. One of the two of us can do it. Poïme. See? Every time your daughter inhales, the knives drop lower. To tell you the truth, the Venetian came up with it. Sign it! One gesture and I'll stop it. No no! He tried to get to the palace. It's a big day for me, Marco Polo. Should I consider your head as a wedding gift for me? Now. Sir. -Chao Lin. -You're a great person. The people of China will be indebted to you forever. People? China? But I did it for her. What a peace. -We're finally alone. -Yes. Thank God. My father asks when our wedding will take place. You decide, Marco. -So, on what day? -No... When do you want. So in three days? Or four? Or rather said… in six days? Beautiful pearls. I have never seen such perfect. These are tiny and we use them as a wedding calendar. Do you use these tiny ones as a wedding calendar? Strange landscape. Every morning before the wedding, the bride goes to the well and throws one pearl into it. Does he throw a pearl here? That's crazy. No, you heard the legend about tears turned into pearls? -Yes. -Symbolize the pain of waiting. That's very nice, but why are you throwing it away? -And then you hunt again. -There are many of them. The girls go looking for them on the coast in Tiensin. They are found in oysters. They are in the oysters in Tiensin. How far is Tiensin? -Marco. -Yes. Do you know how to use them? Yes, I think so. You are like the shadow of a cloud that will take over everything withered. It is true. But also that and I love you, Amurray. Marco, I love you too, more than anyone else in the world. But I and I love who you are. But you can't bind. You would be too unhappy. I know what you mean but I will never go to Tiensin. Same. Sure, my love. Kiss Me. Do you know how to get to Tiensin? Yes, sir, just follow the river. WesternKasa /GM DEZ2020
