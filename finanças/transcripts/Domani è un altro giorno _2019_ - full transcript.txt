TOMORROW'S A NEW DAY I'm going. You gotta be strong, okay ? Love you ! How are you ? - You got on a plane ? - I got on a plane. - It didn't crash ? - No. Apparently not. I'm glad you're here. Come in. Pato, look who's here ! Uncle Tommaso from Canada. Remember him ? Hi. - Your suitcase ? - It's at the hotel across the street. Hotel ? Why not stay here with me ? I have jet lag, I need to sleep alone. Truth is, you've never liked my house. Pato ! That is true. Why didn't you tell me you were coming ? - I wanted to surprise you. - Well, you surprised me. But you could've done it sooner. - Don't you feel a bit guilt-ridden ? - More than a bit. - Guilt would keep me awake at night. - It does keep me awake. Thanks to you, I don't sleep and I'm seeing a shrink. - A shrink ? - Yes. What the hell do you tell your shrink ? - Not the truth ? - No ! Before I forget, I have some stuff for you. Some nice whiskey. And other things. - What's this ? - A drawing from the kids. We should avoid these kinds of things. Tommaso... - How long are you here for ? - Four days. - That's all ? - I have to work on Monday. Are you here to have a talk with me, too ? Well, when I found out about your decision... I hoped we could talk it over. - Bad idea ? - Yes. Because if that's what you think, just go the fuck back to Canada. Gather up all these gifts and go home. But I'll keep this. Listen, Giuliano... you know how afraid I am of flying, right ? Do you think I'd take such a long trip, get here, be told off by you, and just go back home ? I'll be here for four days, Giuliano. Deal with it. It might be rough, but I've dealt with you all my life, you can handle four days. Here's what you can do... take Pato for a walk at the park nearby, all right ? See you outside in 20 minutes, I'll go shower. Okay. You're a stud. A stud, so to speak... Let's go. Come on. Here we are. Sit down, sit. Down, Pato. Good boy. Hello. Pato, hi. - Know him ? - Yes. - You're Giuliano's friend ? - Yes. Give him this. He asked for it a week ago but vanished. All right, thanks. - That's 50 euros. - Right ! Sorry. I thought... you had an arrangement. - Out in the open ? - Relax. Okay. How's Giuliano ? He's taking a shower, he's fine. - You guys are close ? - We are. - Give him my best. - Okay. - Your name ? - He knows. He knows, of course. - Is that Pato ? - I guess he's a local celebrity. - Where's Giuliano ? - At home. - Are you all right ? - At home, then... I'll go there. - Hey. - Where are you ? We're coming. But this girl from the park might beat me there. She's cute but skittish. Do you two need time alone ? - Does she have blue eyes ? - Yes, cute, blue eyes... - But very skittish. - Long hair, about 5'5 ? Maybe 5'6 or 5'7. How the heck should I know ! I need to avoid that nag ! - See you in 5 minutes by the stairs. - Okay, by the stairs... How can you stand it ? Quit staring, you stress me out. Tommaso ? Let's go, she's still in the vicinity. Come on. Who is she ? A pain in the ass, a two-bit actress... I'll explain later. - Where are we going ? - To the vet. It's nearby, we can walk there. Tommaso ? - Why are we whispering ? - Dunno, you started. I did ? Before I saw the skittish girl another one gave me this for you, maybe we shouldn't walk around with it. 20 euros ? I wanted 50. No, it's 50, I paid her. She ripped you off, it's 20. Which ? Why are you pinning his photo up ? So someone will adopt him, or so I hope. Can't your cousin Paola take him ? She has a tiny apartment and a cat. He's a handful. Plus, I still need to talk to him. Talk to him ? - Mocking me ? - No. He's a dog, not a plant, he has personality. He's so alert, look at him. - Yeah. - He understands everything. I have two kids, Pato's one of them. Got it ? - You can go in, Mr. Baroni. - Thanks. Hold him. He's too sensitive to come in. Come on, Tommaso. - Check the parameters. - Okay, doc. - Hi, Giuliano. - How are you ? Fine, you ? Today's hectic. No worries. - I'll be quick. - What is it ? - An issue with Pato. - His paw ? His paw's fine. I was wondering how a dog reacts to loss, to grief. You mean, the death... Of his owner ? How might he react ? Well... it's somewhat like being abandoned. Animals are troubled by loss. On a physical level, how... He might seem withdrawn at first, have psychosomatic symptoms, digestive issues... What about those things you see in the papers, those articles that make you cry about dogs who wait around for their dead owners... - Shall we go into my office ? - No need. I'm just worried about my dog. I have to put him up for adoption, what's better: a family with kids or a single man like me ? I don't know, Giuliano. If you want I can ask my friend who's an animal psychologist. Great idea. I'll pay for his tests in advance so whoever adopts him will keep coming to you. He'll be well taken care of. - Can I leave him for a few hours ? - No problem. - Thanks. - Sure. - Bye, Giuliano. Bye. - Goodbye. You're a stud, Tommaso ! I love you. What matters in life is love. Families, partnerships, relationships. Pato and I. You and I. I come after the dog... But that's fine, buy me breakfast and I'll be fine with anything. Breakfast it is. Who would've thought we'd still be friends after all this time ? Not me. Can I say something deep ? - Yes, but I need breakfast. - I know. - I need to say something. - Say it. I've always admired the fact that you never expect anything in return. You're generous, Tommaso, I'm not. All right, thanks. - And you ? - Me what ? What have you learned from me after all these years ? - Nothing ? - Nope, zilch. You are brave. You're brave. You've always faced things with bravery, even now. This alone made the trip from that godforsaken place you live in worth it. What's it called again ? It always cracks me up. Katz Awry ? Katz Thigh ? - Katz Thai ? - Cat's Eye. - Katz Sigh ! - Cat's Eye, like eye of a cat. Eye of a cat... Taxi ! Cat's Eye ! Can you take us to... Cat's Eye ? Hello, sorry I'm late. No problem, doctor. My cousin Paola couldn't come, so I brought my friend. - Hello. - Hello. He's from Cat's Eye, a town in Canada. Ever heard of it ? It's a hotspot for people who are running from the law. - I'm not running from the law. - I figured. He came to visit. One last time. Well, as I mentioned, we should start another round of chemo. We'll change the meds, as I told you last time, and do a liver scan, which is essential. We can do blood work tomorrow and the scan on Friday. No. I came to tell you I'm not coming back. Giuliano, perhaps last time when we spoke about your test results... - I led you to think that... - No. We did all we could, right, doctor ? Yes. I'm tired of going in and out of the hospital, I'm done with it. I'll miss the nurses. For sure. We've been fighting this fucking lung cancer for a year. The minute I let my guard down... It went cruising around my entire body. Understand, Tommaso ? If I were to do chemo again with the new meds you're suggesting... Would I be cured ? Most people don't ask this, but I do. - Will I be cured ? - No. I doubt it. I'd die anyway. Yes. - So what's the point ? - To buy time, Giuliano. - Think long and hard about this. - You promised to stay quiet. You think I'd fly 10 hours to sit here and stay quiet ? - How much time are we talking about ? - It's hard to say. He'll quickly decline without the treatment. Without the treatment, how long will he have ? Hard to say, it depends on how things evolve. There's nothing more to say. - Do I need to sign anything ? - No. I'll write up a report and make sure the hospital knows. All right. I almost forgot, here's a little something for you. A movie I was in years ago. It's exceptionally bad, but I recall you like crime stories. It's called: "Cut and Run". Thanks, you shouldn't have. If you change your mind, I'm here. Bye. - Bye, thanks. - Bye. Can we talk about it ? - I'll have my cards read. - Good idea. - Tarot card time. - Pick four cards. - Four ? - Yes. - Tommaso ? - Okay. I'll lay out the cards, let me see... Want to know about love, work, passion ? - About my future. - Future ? All right. Here it is. - Are you close friends ? - Yes. But I suspect you fight a lot. He's good ! It's my job. You're a creative person, you have a creative job. You're an artist. See ! This is good news. You'll go on a long trip. Very long. You're incredible. I'll be over there if you need me. - Is he pissed off ? - Tommaso ! He's not pissed off, he's worried about me. I'm having some health issues right now. - I'm sorry. - Anyway, you're great. Some people think Tarot cards are a crock of shit but... - It's for real. - You really believe it. - All right, thanks. - Lemme guess: you don't have a cent. - You really are a genius ! - I could tell. - You are ? - Enzo. - Bye, Enzo. - Good luck ! He's a genius, if I played lotto I'd ask him for numbers. What's wrong ? Nothing, I'm just not used to it. To what ? You. - Can I buy you a gift ? - Sure. - "The Life of Souls". - You're not obliged to read it. Nonsense, you gave it to me so I'll read it. - Thanks. - Bye. Who was that girl from the park, the cute weird one ? She's an actress, very much an actress. What's the problem ? You're very much an actor. True, but she's a very sensitive actress. Too much so, she's sensitive about everything and anything. And if you're sensitive about everything, you're sensitive about nothing. Look, a letter from the Revenue Agency. - This is serious. - That's a ton. It sure is. It's a ton, Tommaso. Thanks. I have 90 days to pay. What's going on ? An actor and his wife came in and pretended not to see me. - Maybe they didn't see you. - No, they saw me. - They looked this way. - Why would they pretend ? They can smell death... and it scares them. Spaghetti and clams ? - Give me a second. - Wait, Giuliano. Don't do it. - Sergio ! - Hello. - How are you ? - Not bad. - You ? - I've been dodging punches lately. How are you ? As usual, she has tons of work and I don't. Same old, same old. Aren't you at the theater now ? Yes, a lousy rendition of "Dangerous Liaisons". I heard it was funny, we'd love to come see it. Well, you'd better hurry up, my run is almost over. Where are you sitting ? With Tommaso, my friend. - I didn't see you. - Actually, you did see me. You both pretended you didn't see me. Listen... I don't expect you to call me or come visit. I'm not saying that... but when we run into each other in public places, say hi... Or give me a hug, I'd appreciate it. Even if... I do understand how you feel. I don't know how I'd react if you, Sergio, had lung cancer. Well, I'll leave you to it. Bye. - Feel better ? - Much, much better. - So we were talking about spaghetti ? - With clams. I think I want grated bottarga on top, too. I fear Vicomte de Valmont will be returning. Auntie wants to invite him again, I hear he's quite the libertine. He's the talk of Paris, he was even able to seduce Madame Violette's engaged niece. I beg you, leave, my mother may arrive at any moment. If she were to find us here, we'd both be doomed. Why does my heart beat so fast... when I write to you ? I've seen it five times, I'm about to fall asleep. Don't despair, your beloved Cecile. Come here. - Want to sit at the bar ? - Sure. Hi. Hello. - Beer ? - Yes. Two beers, please. You look good in the photos you sent. I only send the best photos. But I am well. - Don't you miss it ? - Italy ? No, I miss you, I miss Giuliano, you guys. - How are you ? - I'm fine, I'm trying to be. - My son wants to be an actor, too. - Oh great... - Thanks. - Thanks. - And his father ? - He's nice and caring once a month. - Wow, cheers to him. - Right. How'd the doctor's visit go ? He told him what he already told us. I tried, Paola. It was useless. I did it my own way, maybe it wasn't the best way. But I'm not well-versed in this stuff. I've never had a friend dying before. You can't imagine how many people call me and ask... But they have their own lives. I'm totally on my own, I can't handle it, help me. Of course, you're not alone. That's why I came. I might not do things the right way but... I'll learn and try again. I'll keep trying. - Promise ? - Yes. - Hey. - Hi. I have some things to tell you. Firstly, talk to Alfredo. Tell Alfredo to piss off. You can be my agent now, happy ? Lucky me... - Did you like the show ? - Yes. - Did you get it ? - No. I knew it. Emilio ! - Giuliano ? - What are you doing ? Sleeping. - Tommaso... - I don't want to talk, I want to sleep. It's already a miracle I managed to fall asleep. Yes, hold on... Come over, I'll make spicy spaghetti, it's dinner time in Canada. We're not in Canada, we're in Italy and I was sleeping. We'll smoke a joint, get the munchies, and then sleep. I don't want to start the day now ! Tommaso, I have insomnia. When I sleep I have realistic dreams that scare me. I'm thinking about my dreams. The book you gave me says it's normal to dream about dead people. - Know why ? - No, why ? It's an unconscious way to prepare for the journey: thinking about those who will come get me. - They come get you ? - Of course. Where ? How does it work ? Is there a meeting spot ? Who knows ! I'm only on the first chapter. Who would you want to come get you ? Well ? Who ? I don't know, Giuliano ! Even if I never made peace with my dad, I'd like him to come. It would reassure me. But not my mom, she's a flake, she'd come late or get lost. So you're saying they come to get you and escort you to heaven ? Dunno, I think so. - Weren't you an atheist ? - Yes, totally. Before, totally. Not anymore, apparently. I'll go back to reading. If you get hungry, call. I love you. Me too. Rise and shine, Tommaso ! In here. How are you ? I ordered you scrambled eggs... And orange juice. Put it here, Camilla. Isn't Camilla pretty ? I assume... Thanks, Camilla... ... this is what you eat in Cat's Eye. Complete breakfast. I don't have a bathtub. I'll wash Pato so he doesn't smell when he meets the family. Eat up, so you don't moan about being hungry. Is there any dog shampoo ? I doubt it. Here we go. Come on, Pato. All right. The shower hose is too short. Pato, work with me, help me out. Paw up, good boy. The shower hose is short, stand up. Okay, Pato ? If you don't like the family, wink and we'll blow them off. Move it, Tommaso. Caterina ? That's Caterina ! Quick. - What are you doing ? - Crouch down. - Huh ? - Follow me. - Are you serious ? - Crouch or she'll see you. Pitiful ! - Hush. - A grown adult doing this... - Giuliano ! - Caterina... Tommaso lost his phone. Yes. - You're always around ! - You never answer my calls. I don't answer any calls. - Find it ? - It might not be here... - Can we talk ? - Not now. We're going to see people who might adopt Pato. - Adopt him ? - Yes. Dunno, we'll see. - I'll take him. - Nonsense, no. We have to go. - Can we talk after the show ? - Yes, I'll call you. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Thanks. - May I ? - Come in. Go, Pato... - He's so sweet. - He's very calm. Good, we don't want a watchdog. He's far from that... Well... - What's your son's name ? - Sasha. Nice name. We adopted him from Russia when he was 3. So, Pato, do you like this house ? It's lovely. Did you name him Pato after the Milan soccer player ? No, after Falcao's brother. It's a joke of mine. - Not just yours... - Well, our city's. Exactly. We're really happy about this. - It'll help with the therapy. - What therapy ? The therapist said it would be good for our son to adopt an animal like we adopted him. - Right. - The link between the two is... - They're both adopted. - Yes. Great. Why are you giving him up ? Because I'll be going on a trip very far away and... he can't come with me. - Where are you going ? - Where ? Where are we going ? Yes. Cat's Eye. - An amazing place. - Great. - Great. - Yes. - Why can't he come along ? - Well, because... We have a small apartment with no yard. But it's a gem. - And that town is rather... - Tolerant. You can visit him when you come back to Italy. No doubt. Leave him here today as a trial run. Why ? To see how he and Sasha get along, as a trial run. - Good idea, since we're here. - Not a good idea. To see if he likes it, too. No worries, he'll love it here. Call us tomorrow and come get him. Why not ? He drinks a lot. And he only eats dog food, kibble. I mix it with red meat. - All right. - And he's crazy about ossobuco. - Ossobuco ? - Bone marrow. - You don't have to... - I said ossobuco. - Ossobuco tonight. - Okay. Want to see the house and where Pato will stay ? - Follow me. - Thanks. This way, up the stairs... - Bedrooms are upstairs ? - Yes. We've been together so long. We eat and sleep together... We watch TV together... It's not easy. You haven't abandoned him, you'll see him tomorrow. Sleep over tonight, I'm not used to sleeping alone. - Fine. - Sleep on the couch, you don't mind. I do mind, but that's fine. Come on, I have something to do. What ? No way. You don't have to come. FUNERAL HOME Hello, I need a coffin, nothing too pricy. - For a relative ? - No, for me. - Did you have something in mind ? - Nope, it's my first time. I'll show you some models, our best sellers. See... Which would you pick ? It depends on your taste... No, I mean you. - For myself ? - Yes. Well... I really like this one, for example. The Asian model. Isn't it nice ? Why this one ? It has exquisite trim, the inside is all handmade. It's oak, and it's Made in Italy ! Right and it costs 2,500 euro. That's a ton. - 1,500. - I can't do that. The Asian model is top of the line, I'm sorry. 1,800 ? 2,300, it's oak. It doesn't matter to me if it's oak... - 1,800 ? - 2,200 ? - Did he say 2,100 ? - I think I heard 2,000. Have any used ones ? - Used ? - Like certified pre-owned ones. Fine, 2,000 it is, we'll take it now. - We're in a taxi. - We'll come back for it. - Working on your speech ? - What speech ? - The one you'll give at my funeral. - No, I'm not working on it. And I have no intention of working on it. - I won't give a speech. - If you don't, nobody will. I want a nice depressing speech with a coffin and flowers... - Knock it off. - Don't procrastinate. You always procrastinate and you'll end up giving a shitty speech. - Understand ? So ? - So... enough. I'll get the check. Jesus. - What ? - Is he sitting down ? - Who ? - The guy who just walked in. He's standing. Who is he ? A friend... I slept with his wife. They split up right after, so... He's coming here. Giuliano. Luigi ! What's up ? You look great ! It's been ages. - Still running every day ? - No, just when I have time. - I didn't see you before... - I just walked in. I wasn't sure it was you. - How's it going ? - Fine, I'm working... - Hi. - I'm Tommaso. - Do you still have your firm ? - Yes, and a new partner. That's great ! Listen, I heard about... your issue. I found out recently and it really kills me. I just wanted to tell you. I think about you now and then. I'm really sorry. - Thanks. - Chin up. - I'll leave you to your meal. - Thanks, for real. - Luigi... - This is Monica. He's Giuliano. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. You caught me off guard by coming to talk to me. You really moved me. - I came to apologize. - You don't need to. Yes, I do, because we were friends. I did an ugly thing. And I'm sorry for not having apologized when it happened. I accept your apology, thanks. But because of what happened I met Monica. We're having a baby. - Congrats ! - Thanks. Let's go, Giuliano Bye. Congratulations. I fear Vicomte de Valmont will be returning. Auntie wants to invite him again, I hear he's quite the libertine. He's the talk of Paris. It's my turn, what's my line ? What's my line ? Don't ask me ! I'm blanking out, this keeps happening. - Is it my turn ? - I'll go ask. Go. He brags about his numerous conquests. Excuse me, Giuliano forgot his lines, he needs a prompt. - Hold on. - Okay. Hello, madams ! Are you discussing love ? Hello, Vicomte. We were passing time discussing the insidiousness of love. Would you be willing to reject it ? In the name of your villainous chastity. You seem to forget that love is a remedy. It's the art of assisting nature. - May I ? - You're always welcome. - Tommaso, he's the director. - Nice to meet you. Have a seat. How are you ? Giuliano, Giuliano... I heard about your illness. When I found out a week ago... I burst into tears. I have no words of consolation. - Thanks. - But, as Oscar Wilde said... "If a friend gave a feast and did not invite me, I should not mind. But if he had a sorrow and doesn't share it, I'd feel bitter". I was a bit pissed off at you, to be honest. I think I should've been the first to find out. - Are we or are we not friends ? - We are, of course. Who fought to get you on stage ? It was considered sacrilegious to put a TV actor on a theater stage. I appreciate all you've done, I didn't want to bother you. You are a lovely person. When I found out, I wanted to call everything off but... I can't. The show must go on, always. Even if finding a replacement... was practically impossible. Who ? Filippo Buttafuoco. Please, spare me the comments... There's no comparison, it's the best I could do. Understand ? You're always on my mind. Goodnight. Did he just fire me ? Seemed like it. Everything's falling apart, Tommaso. Everything. Blackened car and scooter carcasses reveal the explosive force of this morning's bomb in al-Bab, near Aleppo. A suicide bomber drove an explosive loaded car... - Giuliano, it's Paola. - You answer it. She probably wants a recap of the day. Paola, how are you ? We're fine, yes. No, we're okay. He's a bit down. The show went fine but... after, the theater director came into his dressing room. He'll explain the story in more detail. I'll tell him, okay. Bye. Any whiskey left ? Yes. She said to call her. I will. What's the point of killing in the name of God ? He knows how to do it himself. Okay, we're going to turn off this TV. That's all we needed... I'll put on some music. What a modern system, look at this ! It still works ! - Yeah. - Let's make a toast. A toast to something that really struck me. Here. - What ? - Here. To the director's pastries. - He took them away ! - True. Why ? Who were they for ? - Dunno. - It's a mystery. He must've made a mistake. Damn, it's strong ! You know how it is when you're 5 years old and you meet another kid who you like right away and you say: "Can we be friends for life ?" That happened with me and you in college. Well, you were 5 years old in college so that makes sense. Plus, you didn't go to college, you just hovered around to pick up chicks... You've always had a great nose, like a truffle dog. For white truffles ! Did Pato behave well ? Thanks. So ? No problem, I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks, bye. - Damn it. - What ? The kid didn't have time to spend with the dog, he got home late, so they'll go to the park today. - We'll go get him tomorrow. - All right. That's good, they really seem to care. Hope so. - What's the plan for today ? - Dunno. I planned to go pick up Pato. - And Leonardo ? - Daddy's champ. He's so handsome. He's turning 23 in a few days. Time flies ! That's right ! Call him, let's meet up. We can have lunch, I'd like that. - That's not a bad idea. - Do it. - For real ? - Yes. - When ? - Why not today ? That is a brilliant idea ! You're awesome, what an idea ! If you want time alone, I'll say hi then scram. Nonsense ! I always refer to you as a role model in life. I always tell him a bunch of bullshit about you. You buy the tickets, I don't know how. - What tickets ? - The plane tickets. Leo lives in Barcelona. - Barcelona ? - He studies there, you know that. I forgot. So we'll have lunch in Barcelona ? - It was your idea. - I didn't know he was in Spain. You had this brilliant idea because you're brilliant and have a degree. If you ask me where I want to go right now, I'd say: "To Barcelona with Tommaso to visit my son Leo". For his birthday, nonetheless. Buy the tickets, I'll shower. Hey, Tommaso... If you don't feel up to it, we can buy a loaf of bread, go to the park, sit on the benches and feed the ducks. It could be our... Did I already thank you ? How is Leo ? Better. He doesn't open up much. But he's fine and I didn't... I didn't tell him the whole truth. - Meaning ? - Meaning, he... He thinks the situation is still under control. Why should I tell him ? I want him to be happy, I'll tell him when the time comes. What's that face for ? Why should I tell him ? This year was hard enough on him. He's in Barcelona with his girlfriend, he's happy. - Why do I have to bust his balls ? - He has the right to know. Gimme a break, everyone's busting my balls with their advice. And none of you understand how it feels. What's that ? Miss, can we get some water or coffee ? Not now, fasten your seatbelts. There's some turbulence. Oh great... Wouldn't that be great ? Me and you... dying together. Leave me out of it ! - It's destiny. - Keep your destiny to yourself. - Our destiny. - God ! If this is the end... It's everyone's destiny. - Dust to dust... - Knock it off ! What a great city ! Look at this city, this is the future. The future, Tommaso ! Everyone is smiling ! If this is the square, we have to go that way. Let's see... here. This way. - How beautiful ! - Here. This is 7, 5... over there. - Is he home ? - Dunno, we didn't talk. What do you mean ? I called him 20 times, left messages, but we didn't talk. We came to Barcelona not knowing if he's here ? You're such a drag ! Relax. This is 5, we're here. If he's not here ? Which buzzer ? - Leo Baroni, do you know him ? - Hold on. - They're looking for Leo ! - He's not here. He went out this morning. - Thanks. What was that ? - He went out this morning. - Where might he be ? - At school, for sure. Thanks. - Okay... - At school, easy. How beautiful ! It's full of young people. They spend all day smoking joints... making love, listening to music, you know ? Young people... The university's not that close. Who cares ! Let's face the future. We'll take a stroll. - The future. - The future happens to be this way. We have to go that way... You okay ? We're going the right way. - Need some water ? - No. We'll get water at that cafe and take a taxi. I'm all right. - Let's slow down. - All right, come on. I'll lean on you. We're in Barcelona ! Yes, on your campus. In the lobby. - It's called a cloister, not a lobby. - In the cloister. You see me ? I'm behind you. - Dad ! - In the flesh. - What happened ? - Nothing. - Look who's here ? - I saw. - How are you ? - Fine, you ? Not bad. - Are you okay ? - Yes, don't worry. Tommaso had a convention here in Barcelona. And since you're here, we decided to come visit you. - You could've let me know. - I've been calling all morning. I was in class. Want to have lunch ? I already have plans, I have a concert tonight with Sophie's friends... Not to worry, we're flying back tonight. We have to get back to Rome. Don't worry, seeing you was already a treat. No, don't say that, I just wasn't expecting you. How about if we get a bite now ? I'll call Sophie and we'll go to the beach. - Okay ? - Perfect. This is the place I wanted to take you. I'm going to look for a postcard, I'll be back. Is here okay ? How nice. - Do you come here often ? - Yes. I met Sophie here. - What is it ? - I couldn't show up empty-handed. - Well... - A little something. - No, it's great. - You know what it is ? - Yes. - A pipe. You can use it for hash, weed, whatever you like. Thanks, it's great. I don't smoke, but thanks. - What do you mean you don't smoke ? - I don't smoke. - But I like it. - Great, that's good. You don't smoke... - Let's look at the menu. - Yeah. Are you happy here ? Do you like what you're doing ? Yes, yes. Postcards are hard to come by nowadays. My wife is dead set on getting a postcard. So tell me, what kind of conference are you here for ? - The conference... - The conference ? Super boring, a drag. - Robotics. - Robotics ? I work for a company in Montreal that creates prototypes, and I teach at the university, super boring. So tell me about Canada... You just went there one day, and stayed. - You got married and live there. - I live there. - Careful, or you'll do the same. - No, I don't think I'd stay here. Actually, I'd like to go back to Rome after I finish school. Rome ? For what ? You speak languages, you can go anywhere. You want to end up being a tour guide in your city ? A centurion ? What's your plan ? It's barren... don't come back to Rome. - Here's Sophie. - The famous Sophie. Hi. My dad and his friend Tommaso. - Hello ! - Nice to finally meet you. Likewise. - Why didn't you tell me he was coming ? - I didn't know. Tommaso and I wanted to surprise him. Forgive my substandard Italian. Most Italians can't say "substandard". Pick whatever you want, it's on us. - Aren't they attractive ? - Dad, please. Please, what ? You're adorable. Thanks, you also look better "alive" than in photos. - Is that how you say it ? - "In real life". In real life... Yes, this unkempt look is my allure. Leo always talks about you. - He's says you're very special. - Very special ? He doesn't tell me much, I had to fly here to meet you. Now I feel a bit guilty... You are wonderful, gorgeous, don't worry. How are you ? Fine. - I'm fine. - Shall we toast ? It's his birthday after all ! It sure is. How about some champagne ? - Sure, we're paying. - Yes. You promise ? After exams I'll come back to Rome for Christmas. You and Sophie can have my place all to yourselves, and I'll go stay at mom's. At mom's ? Yeah right ! I have places to stay in Rome. Do you ? - Are you okay with money ? - I have plenty. No, dad, no need. I have enough. Nonsense, you can never have enough. Here. Take Sophie out for a nice dinner... Thanks. We have to go to class now. - Sophie. - It was a pleasure. - Treat him well. - Indeed. Nice to meet you, good luck. - Bye. - Bye, Tommaso. - Bye, Leo, take care. - You too. All right... bye, dad. See you for Christmas. - I took your Barcelona map. - That's all right. - Bye, Leo. - Bye. I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it this time either. Where are you going ? To cry alone. Gimme a minute. I want to get drunk tonight. With you. Because you deserve it. He's having a blast... all because of you ! Let's go dance, come on. Giuliano ? Caterina. Why are you avoiding me ? I even went to your house. - Why won't you leave me alone ? - What did I do ? Why didn't you tell me about it ? You're a smart girl, please, forget me. I know this is a rough time for you. But we can get through it together. I'm ready. We've gone out three times max. You go looking for pain. But you're young, you'll see... life dishes it out, a little for everyone. Don't be impatient. Please, at least respect my pain. If I'm asking you to leave me alone, leave me alone. And he said: "Kill the mermaid". So a guy went there and with one shot... the tail flapped until... It stopped. You're an idiot. When do you leave ? In two days. Tomorrow's my last full day. It's kind of strange. You could've stayed a few more days. Tomorrow I'll make you an eggplant pasta that's so good, it's illegal. Paola, don't leave me with him, I can't take him anymore. Same here, please join us. - I'll try. - Try is not enough ! A friend of mine took one bite and was blown away... If you don't join us, he'll make my ears bleed with his pasta tales. At the second bite, he was moved to tears. - He sounds unhinged. - Fine, I'll join you. Giuliano ? Take your vitamins. Goodnight. Night. God... Damn. I'm scared, Tommaso. Very. I try not to think about it but how can I ? The more you block something out, the more it comes back. When you don't want to think about elephants, elephants come to mind just like that. At night, when I think about my illness, my head spins. Remember the funfair ride called The Rotor ? It went so fast, you got stuck to the wall. I remember it. Like that. That's how I feel when I think about my illness. As if I were on The Rotor. We had fun on it when we were kids. But I'm too old for that now. Yes, all right. No problem. It's all right. Thanks, bye. They want puppies. When I mention Pato's age their tone of voice changes. That couple with the adopted boy ? They don't want him, the kid's afraid Pato will die. The kid's afraid Pato will die. Yes, another sort of separation, abandonment. Nobody thought about that, they didn't consider it. - So now what ? - What ? Can I feed him some of my sandwich ? - No. - Why ? Because he's a dog and dogs don't eat sandwiches. You can pet him. Gently, he's not a toy. Okay, that's enough. Go eat. Voila ! - Ham and cheese. - I just moved my knight. Take it easy. You always think I cheat. Here. Nice move... Imagine that, for someone who is far from skilled... - Watch it, the queen's there. - Butt out. - I wanted to take this, okay ? - Are we playing checkers now ? A nice game of checkers. There's an afternoon performance, I want to check out that duffer. Are you Giuliano Baroni ? Yes. What an honor, I'm a huge fan. - From day one. - Really ? - Yes. - Thanks. Can I take a selfie with you ? None of the priests will believe me. - Sure, why not ? - Come here, Pato. You're popular with us. - Really ? - Yes. - With clergymen ? - Yes. - Tommaso ? - Gloria ! - Hi. - How are you ? - Fine, you're back ? - Just to visit him for a few days. He didn't tell me ! He doesn't talk much and never takes my calls. He doesn't seem to take anyone's calls. My ex-wife with my best friend. Imagine that ! This takes me back in time. - Did you talk to Leo ? - Yes, why ? We went to Barcelona yesterday. - Barcelona ? - For his birthday. Yes, just a quick jaunt. - We had a surprise party for him. - Wonderful ! We toasted and I talked to him a bit. Finally ! I didn't know how to handle it anymore. He kept calling and bombarding me with questions. I didn't know what to say and... I just couldn't bear to lie to him. I told him everything. He was heartbroken, poor thing. I tried to explain that we must respect your decision because it's your choice. - Yes, of course. - But you talked to him now. We didn't talk that much. Well done. I'm off. - It was nice to see you. - Likewise. Bye. Call me if you need anything. You guys take me back in time, too. Attached at the hip, just like 20 years ago. I should've realized it from the hug. Call him. Of course. I will. Come on, Pato. He terrifies me, he unsettles me. I will write him asking him to steer clear of me. Hello, madams. Are you discussing love ? Hello, Vicomte. We were passing time discussing the insidiousness of love. Would you be willing to reject it... to save your villainous chastity ? He's worse than I thought. Have you forgotten that love is a remedy ? It's the art of assisting nature. And nature... Ouch. - That must've hurt. - No doubt. He'll be icing it for a week. Excuse me, yesterday I took over from a great actor. I know I don't measure up, so forgive me. I know he's here tonight so let's hear it for Giuliano Baroni ! Buttafuoco ! Giuliano ? Caterina. - Please... - I just wanted to hug you. Come here. I'll go back in... and clap for you. You're leaving tomorrow, I hate goodbyes, I won't come to the airport. I don't want you to come. - We'll say bye on the street. - All right. You'll take a taxi, get on the plane, and go back to... Cat's Eye, the end. That's right. I have to use the bathroom. What's wrong ? I peed myself. I peed myself. No big deal, we'll go home and get changed. I was a playboy. I was a playboy, you know ? Two coffees. Let's go. Here you go. Before going to school, that's the face I see every morning. Allow me. The moment of truth... - That's enough. - Just a little for me. We need to finish this. You'll spoil me and when I go back... - Thanks. - All set. What's the saying ? It doesn't matter... - The recipe doesn't matter. - The recipe... What matters is listening to the ingredients. Vintage Baroni in top form. What is that from ? God, that is delicious. You're not eating ? Not tonight. It's good. - You don't want ricotta on it ? - I don't. Neither do I, thanks. I wanted to tell you something... Here we go. Another secret ? I know all your secrets. All of them ? No way, trust me. I've decided I won't wait till the very end. When things get ugly, very ugly... I'll take some pills my doctor friend gave me. Thanks for sharing that bullshit. - Why bother telling us ? - What's the difference ? I'll just go sooner. I want to spare myself an agonizing end and having my ass wiped by you. Or my son. - Is this because of today's accident ? - No. What happened today ? I wet my pants. So ? Maybe I shouldn't have told you. I could've written a letter and been done with it. Too late now. You miss performing, I guess. - Paola... - Shut up, you said you'd try. He did try. He did what he could. But I've made up my mind. It's a joke, right ? What are these pills ? A doctor friend gave me them. Great, perfect. When did you decide this ? Just curious. When I got my last test results. When the doctor told me I was dying. Then just die now and get it over with. Isn't that what you want ? Aren't you going to say anything ? Of course not, you're just here for a reunion. I'm glad you told us. And if you want, when the time comes, I'll be there with you. I don't want you to come back. This is something I will do alone. Why don't the two of you fuck off ! Did I say something wrong ? Here, the soul book. It's interesting, read it. It's not just about life after death, it's also... about life. - What time is your flight tomorrow ? - 14:30. Then I'll see you... at 10:00 in your hotel. These four days flew by. It's crazy. - Goodnight, Giuliano. - Night. - Is he awake ? - Yes. - I left my phone there. - Don't I get a goodbye ? Bye, I'll keep you posted. Actually, I won't because you already know how it'll end. It's not your fault. It's not my fault, it's not Giuliano's fault either. It happens. - So ? - So we all did what we could. Some more than others. Know why I don't feel guilty about Giuliano ? Because I'm proud of him. Very proud. - Did you tell him ? - No. No need to. Hello. All right... - I left my phone at your place. - I noticed. - Did you call a taxi ? - No, I'll drive. Will you wait or is this goodbye ? I think we should say goodbye here. Bye. - Safe travels. - Thanks. Here, Tommaso. This is Pato's ticket. Here are his papers, vaccination records, and his tests. I wanted him to fly with you but the airline won't allow it. They'll put him in cargo in a sort of crate. They'll take him at check-in. I just got these this morning, his rabies certificates. When you land, it's the first thing they'll ask for. If you see him stumbling around like he's drunk or drooling a lot, it's because I gave him a sedative. It's totally normal, okay ? Give him a bath when you get home and he'll be fine. And tell those pesky kids of yours... to treat him well. "TOMORROW'S A NEW DAY" Subtitles:Nueva ®™
