HOW THE WAR STARTED ON MY ISLAND -VVV- to go out of the Yugoslav Federation, and the establishment of an independent Croatia and independent republic On the territory of Croatia, there were still military barracks of the Yugoslav People's Army which recognize only the laws of the Yugoslav Federation, and ignored the request of the citizens to leave the country and to release the Croatian youth serving in these military barracks "...based on police source, the reason not to trigger bus is unknown? "But more likely inability to operate and" "And in other areas tensions did not ease during the night" "From time to time there was opened fire from light weaponry but there were no reports of deaths and material damage" "According to police, it comes to provocative shots" "And yet the movement in volatile regions is your own responsibility" "The decision to block the YPA barracks, is applied in many Croatian towns" "Our reporters reported that the entrances of the military sites are blocked by citizens who peacefully demonstrate..." "And today, several barracks, dozens of beardless youths fled to freedom. They testified that many of their comrades are unwilling to fight against their fellow citizens." "Many of them say that they understand the situation" "The newly established crisis staffs offer them shelter, clothes, and organize their journey to their homes" Excuse me, I beg of you, do you know where is the army "folk hero"? Forgive me! Do you know where is the army "folk hero"? No! There is no "folk hero"! Run away! Hooligans!-Excuse me. Every day, they brake down one-Can you lend me a hand? What do you want? I am looking for the army "folk hero" - Are you a soldier? What soldier? I am an art specialist I must quickly find this army. -Wonderful! You would not believe me, you know? I paint a little bit I just jot down some associations canvas But there are no specialists here.Look, if you have a moment to glance into the studio to see some of my work. I'm in a hurry, my son is a soldier here I'd like to sneak him out of there somehow Comrade Major, soldier Sven Gaiski At your orders, I gathered all the transistors in the army Soldiers wish you a good reception and a pleasant listening Get out you animal! Sir! And where are you going? Over there.I'm going to the gate. Are you crazy? You'd best stay here. Alright, you better not cry later! You cannot,comrade.You must go. Can any of your seniors? I'm telling you they can't.I can't let anyone, now go! How about the duty officer? Can't, how do I go from here! Flee from here, someone might come and shoot you. Move! Listen, son. I'm the father of your colleague, Sven Gaiski I'd like to see him. -You can't! Negotiations are ongoing ???? ?? ??????.-?? ???? ?? ??! Just for a moment. -Are you deaf! You must not go near here! If the major comes, We'll be in trouble, you, me. All of us! Did I not tell you to stay put. What...what are you gloomy about? Come on, Roko will fix everything. Roko? -Roko Papak, Chairman of the Crisis He and Murko are negotiating inside. They are pressing that crazy major Sit down! I gotta piss, man. I gotta go. There is no going, not until the major returns! Gaiski! -Please, comrade Major Is that how you hold a rifle! Come on! Aleksa,listen! What, Roko, what do you want again? Are you sending me on a betrayal! -What betrayal? Who the heck is talking about this, Aleksa! For you, I am just a comrade Major. -Leave that now, You must give up the army, possibly until noon To allow soldiers to catch the ferryboat in 7:00 o'clock Civilian clothes are here, ferryboat tickets and the bus are also. And later we'll celebrate all of this... -First! "Combine the wires to the terminals of the machine" Second. "Put the handle in the slot of the inductor" Third. "Turn the handle of the inductor two or three rotations per second" "For around 10 seconds" Fourth. "Leave the key on the bed" "Fire is performed by turning the key to "ignition" Listen to me, Roko! This here is a machine for blowing up If someone pulled a number against the army here I'll be buried alive, blown to smithereens Everything will be gone! You, us. And half of the town You attack all you like Are you crazy Aleksa! Comrade Major from YPA! Listen, we've known each other since 10 years You here are a well known man.

You, the dishwasher, command me-the professional! Messenger Connect this! You really want to lift the whole town. I've told you my opinion, do what you want. I really gotta go take a leak. -Nope! In this army you won't even take a piss! There they are. Get up! Soldiers! Do not let YPA turn you into criminals. We are not against you. We just want freedom. Croatia does not require foreign armies. Officers, let the soldiers go outside and to embrace with their peers They should have arrived here 3 hours ago Are they even on their way? I can't be everywhere. Well, what are you doing? -Sir, Papak. Where were you? I was worried for you guys. From what group are you? -I'm from Blaj Gaiski. 55th-6th It's fine. What's important is to... My son is here in the army. I must get him out of here. So you're not that drummer? Where are they...the show stopped and this guy isn't a drummer Did you hear what I said? I need help... -I heard, why are you yelling Forgive me, I'm losing my nerves. -You think I'm not? The most important thing is patience. You must wait!

From where could I get it? Alright, apologies. Goodbye! CRISIS HEADQUARTERS What's wrong? I'm looking for Mr.Papak -He's inside. Mr Papak! You're the only one who has the telephone number for the army. It's very important to call someone and to explain the whole situation. My son... -Who should I call, to that crazy Aleksa! He doesn't want to talk to anybody, except for the commanders. Don't be like that, you know far too well that I'm in the encirclement I haven't been home Alright tell me.. He wouldn't even dare to talk with the commanders Well yes! Central...Ioco, is that you? Listen, you have connections with the army I am from the crisis headquarters! Can you stop Aleksa, cut his call Cut everything. Hello? Hello! Not me, him! Come on, that way! Smartass! Enough with this! Give the boys a beer. Dante, come on now, its your turn. Why does Dante have to speak nonsense for the 5th time.

Everything as we negotiated. I don't know how to do this, Roko. -There's nothing to be afraid of, you go there and talk on the microphone, so that he can hear you can't someone else do it instead? Who else? You're his wife and what you will tell him, will propbably influence him. -True! Mr. Papak! Mr. Papak! Here, I have written a letter to his commander Inside I have written everything with details on the situation. Now you must officially send a messenger... You're getting on my.. you know what! Don't you see we have work to do. And so what, you want that Aleksa to make a mess? No, jeez, what should I tell him? About what we talked about. To let the soldiers go, to return home, to return to his people here Aleksa! Aleksa! Alright, you hear me, and now the other thing What other thing? -What we negotiated, to get back home. Aleksa! Come back home. Is he alright? -Yes, keep going about that why he must return Aleksa, go back home. I've prepared you nettle stew He loves it. -Not that, woman... Tell him to return home because of you and these people here Aleksa! Aleksa! Return home. It's me Lucia telling you this. Do it for these people here. But also for me too! Remember everything well, as it was, Aleksa. When you first arrived here to serve, I was still going to school When you saw me for the first time, I knew that we would be together until death do us part And my mother, my father and even my brothers, said that I shouldn't marry an officer but I did not care about that and we lived well You went every day to work as I was working at home, I cooked And so you fell in love with my dishes, this town, this country And how I fell in love with you! So did the whole town like you. Aleksa, this is your place this is your country Here is your house, in which I await for you. So please come out! Let those soldiers go. Look at these people here There he is. -They've been here since 3 days! They are staying here and waiting for you. And I've been waiting for you for six days. You must tell them where you were those other 3 days while you were gone No, you must tell them I know very well where you've been You've been with that bitch, with that bitch with that musical teacher That's what you told me last year You've been on a military assignment, eh? When you've been with her for 4 days, you think I didn't know I know well what you've been doing there, but no more. No! I stay home and you go around doing things behind my back! But remember this. Don't show yourself to me You do not have to come home... -Major, I found the malfunction. Tomorrow it will be fixed. Go! ...because if I see you, I will crush your head like a snake, you hear? As for that emptyheaded woman... I will break her spine I will gouge her eyes out, rip her tongue and... Just let me see her. You listen to me well! Well...that escalated quickly! It's your own fault! You brought her here! Hey mister! Can you call someone? Thanks, I've already inserted a coin. -By the way, you can see the pictures. What pictures...I don't understand what's going with... Is that you? Everything is alright. they should release him any moment now Do not panic! Everything will go smooth. Changing the guard. Faster! Mr.Papak, please! I also beg you, don't you see we have work to do There he is. What should I tell him? Koshava, koshava...here is Bonaca, Bonaca, over and out! Bona...Bon... Kosha..over. Major, I have made contact The situation at Bonaca is serious! they cut us off, they will stop the water too What should we do, over Tell him to do something before someone comes Do not...before someone comes.. someone from....here Who? Who to come? -Who, who...! Come up with something. Do not do anything... Who? Don't do anything.. Colonel...Kostadinovich ...with the orders Fine! We'll have to wait for colonel Kostadinovich And you fix this, you can see it doesn't work! Fast, come on! Run! Are we having a stroll? Come on, move it! Come on boys. Now let it go There, now we can see it better Mr. Munita! I will try to go to the gate, and ask a solider to give the letter to my son A letter! That his father has gone crazy. Enough nonsense Why, did you not see how that guy took the rifle. Didn't you see how that guy looked like? There's Roko. If he lets you in, I don't care Mr. Papak I would like to ask...-Well, friend, patience Here, join us Your students from the bodybuilder club are calling for you. Together we exercised and trained on the equipment Do you see how it is today you're holding us on target. What are you fighting for, Aleksa! Yugoslavia is no more! It is now Croatia. Separate and independent. Go outside. Even though you're an officer from YPA, you were a member. Remember, Croatia is your home! Well? Nothing. He didn't even come out of the office -What did I tell you? Now its vocal-instrumental club "Door"'s turn. ??? ????????? ???? ????? ???? ?? ????? "??????" Aleksa, get out of there! This is what "Door" recommends you We will always sing for you your favorite song And now we shall play it, you will remember those days, so that never again will you think of killing Boys, we're starting! One and a two.. I feel like something is going away. Your brain is going away.. Get up! There he is. What? What's he doing? There he is! Now that worked. Crying! Goddamn it... So little was left for him to surrender. What did I tell you! Everyone abandoned me! My wife betrayed me, my friends left me, The music is killing me Only you, you did not! Do not worry Father will give you as much as you need! When the time comes Don't you start We'll beat your father with only a song. This hurts him the most. Did you see last night? He missed it so much, to give up the army Mr.Munita, I can't do this anymore. You again? You always want something as if you're more important Can't you be like everyone else and mind your..-Look he's coming out! With that machine! He's spinning the handle Picking up the key. He's gonna shoot! Alright. Let's run away. Coward! Look, a boat. A boat? Some idiot is going toward the army What do you mean he's going! Look... This we did not need. Hey, you there! In this emergency situation, I am responsible for the whole town. For everyone here, even for you And you're dangerous to yourself and those around you That crazy Major will think we're attacking him by sea Who knows what he'll do This is why it's best if you do not show around the army When your son goes out, we are here to help You do not need him here And because of that, tomorrow you will immediately get aboard on the very first ferryboat and go home Is that clear? Go home! Slowly get back on your way. You won't do no good here. Good afternoon. Anyone there? What do you want? Excuse me for asking, but can I use the telephone Oh, its you? Absolutely, feel free After you end your call, come back to me I have a wonderful home made rakia, eh? Listen, here I can't do much tomorrow I'm coming back home What do you mean you don't get it, I can't get close. I am guilty. Yes, you're the smartest, you always know best you know when it will start and... Listen to what I'm saying, I can't... Hello? HELLO? Thank you for the phone. -No problem. Was it nice? Thank you once again. I must go. -Wait! What about the pictures? There's no art specialist visiting daily. Please don't feel discouraged, I really don't have the time And you made this? ????? ?????. ???? ?????? ...is accusing me, because I did not let him in Germany when he was called in the army I let him go, they were going to accuse him for desertion and he wouldn't have been able to come back And as for that picture over there I need two months I couldn't figure out how an aeroplane carrier looked like And that is why who knows what he would have ended up in Germany This is New York.

Whom by this moment, thought she knew you I've been teaching for 10 years singing by now, harmony, love not violence! Do you see, it's not our victory that this is about. The enemy inside, backed by the gloomy global response acts against our brightest ideals The crazy ambitions of their leaders, Are falling down like a tower of cards ...and give up on your criminal intentions. I have not taught you how to hate But to love! This one really teaches love alright. Everyone knows this. Do this because of our love You dumb bitch! Emptyhead! Aleksa, leave that nest of evil go outside... -Well, I won't until I am alive! You better not move from there, you hear me! Please, Aleksa, Please!

Martin is doing well He's got a lot of soldiers around him It looks like he's instructing to them how to escape I put her on the roof white, soft, She was naked, completely naked Her nipples... her nipples erected... And I... sucked on them, do you understand? And the roof was slippery and in order to make it not so slippery I put one of my legs on one shoulders the other... You don't understand! Come! Up, up. You. Get up here. So! Lay down. One of my legs... ...on one of your shoulders.Like so! The other... ...on the other shoulder. Now you get it? And now you work.

What's up with you, we aren't even half ready Here, Colonel Where were we? Oh yeah, how I was fucking Stepanovich Here, Colonel, this is the machine for blasting This is the only real ensuring With just one single movement in this room within a second everything will be up in the sky Let's see them attack as much as they like The wires are tied to the machine terminals joined and buried with explosives The handle of the inductor will turn two to three rotations per second for around 10 seconds Then he sets the key on the bed and perform by turning the ignition key to position... Alright, I got it already... Excellent! Why am I even mentioning this, Colonel, when you know better than me These explosives, is someone guarding them? -Of course, Colonel! On duty are the most capable of soldiers Have a look for yourself, Colonel Open up! Here, Colonel That's it! If it weren't for this, you would have heard a shooting Except for this, I've mined two more The system for chain explosion is...my idea What do you think Colonel? Exceptional, ingenious! Is this all of the soldiers you have? Of course, Colonel All of them? Except for that one who is in prison. But I do not rely on him as a soldier. He was on duty without ammunition and did not fulfil an order I still haven't decided if he should be shot or not Take me to him right now. Of course, Colonel Come on, what are you waiting for! Attention! What are you... Mind your words, traitor! In the most difficult moments of our army and you turn your back Don't think you will pass without punishment! We got you, solidarity with those outside, and this is treason! I will personally make sure you receive your punishment and this is none other than a shooting I've seen enough, Colonel. Take me to the office right away. -As you wish, Colonel! That's my father! What are those two doing? Which two? What's Martin doing? He's still talking to them in Slovenian. -Let him talk. as long as he doesn't sing! He's still here. He's here! Damned loud noise! That's that crazy poet, he's been a nuisance every day Why did you not shut him up? -How, when the Major doesn't let us shoot him! Slow down with the poetry. As it is with us, so is for him. I think it's best with that... ...from where was that, from Vardar..yes.. Come on, we're starting As loud as possible! Three-Four.. Come see, Martin has gone mad! There's no stopping now! What did I tell you! Come on Dante, why'd you go silent? Get down here. They'll see now! Where are "Door"? Door! Attention! We're continuing boys, louder.. We've silenced them, nobody will hear them now But now we won't be able to hear each other... What'd you say? Colonel, you can now give me the orders and after that we'll have lunch and... And so. I have nothing handwritten in me Smart! Smart, Colonel So then, you have verbal orders What is our task? All of the explosives to be transported outside of the army What, all of them? Yes, all of them! And to where? That I cannot say. I understand, Colonel So it's military secret. You can't tell me. I cannot! -Understood. I understood completely, Colonel. Everything is clear as day. We're breaking the rulers, aren't we! I cannot share this, but I will probably make you happy I'm already happy, Colonel You just tell me how many soldiers do you require for guards, six, eight? Four Three for the trucks and 1 to watch the prisoner What, you'll take him also? I must hand him over to military court Yes! True! That's his place! Quickly! Quickly now!
