"To the children of the future" "from adults who lived the past" "This movie is a work of fiction based on our experiences" "and real stories we heard in Nagaoka, Niigata, in 2011." "Nagaoka Film" CASTING BLOSSOMS TO THE SKY If people made pretty fireworks instead of bombs there wouldn't have been any wars. Words by wandering artist Kiyoshi Yamashita. Taking a trip is like wandering into fantasy land. My trip to Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, in the summer of 2011 was just that. I had dream-like experiences that were full of wonder. But they were all part of Nagaoka's history. This story is based on actual experiences by the citizens of Nagaoka. Yes, they're all true stories. Here in Japan there are still many untold, dream-like wonderlands some of them forgotten before they were even told. Would you like to join me on a journey to go visit them? "A 2011 film by Nobuhiko Obayashi" "Reiko Endo's Wonderland A Journey of Emotions to Nagaoka" This is Sakon in the city of Nagaoka. They tell me it was a nice sunny day. "July 20, 1945" "7:30 AM" This siren is a warning. A signal that enemy airplanes are coming to attack. At the time, Japan was at war with the U.S. and U.K. and this happened very shortly before Japan's defeat. People were used to it and left for the fields as usual. It was a blistering hot summer morning, the sun blazing in the sky. Today is also a day in a blistering hot summer. "Shinano River, Nagaoka, Niigata 7:30 AM on July 20, 2011" I received a letter. This unexpected letter prompted me to wander into Wonderland. The letter had a nostalgic scent. Scents are cruel because they always remind you of some scenery. Even before I opened the letter, I was certain that "Early summer, 2011" it was going to take me back to the past when we were two halves of a whole. Who are you? From where did you come to greet me? From that moment, I think I was already in a dreamland of my journey. How are you? I'm fine. "Yamakoshi, Nagaoka" I'm finally able to write you a letter. It took a very long time. You went back to Amakusa and I came back here to Yamakoshi. We parted so suddenly without a proper farewell. I might sound brusque but I can only talk to you like how I used to. If this letter troubles or annoys you... - We're off. - See you later. just throw it away. Time stopped moving for me after the Great East Japan Earthquake. My past came rushing back to me in a completely different light. Amidst all that, Reiko... I thought about you and me. Watch yourself. Why? Why? Sorry. "18 years ago in Tokyo" Did you stop loving me? We have nothing to do with war. War? We broke up but more accurately I suddenly vanished. Without giving him a good reason, I erased my existence. It hurts. This rain hurts! When you mentioned the word "war" it felt really bizarre. I remember the feeling well. Your letter is right here. I took the trip with the scent of your letter. I don't know if I'd be here if the Great East Japan Earthquake hadn't occurred. No... I probably wouldn't be. That's Chosei Bridge, or "long life bridge." This view hasn't changed since before war. People fled across the bridge during the air raid. So I heard. I was born after the war. They say it was horrible. Where were you during the earthquake? The Chuetsu Earthquake? No, this one. After the Great East Japan Earthquake lots of people from Minami Soma came here seeking shelter. The town near the nuclear power plants in Fukushima... "Akiyoshi Muraoka" The Great East Japan Earthquake occurred this year on March 11, 2011. One afternoon in April right after the disaster "Chuetsu Senior High School, Nagaoka" a student from the drama club came to me with a script. But strangely I had no recollection of her before that. "There's Still Time Until a War" by Hana Motoki. Unicycles are only allowed in designated areas. Her name is Hana Motoki, "hana" as in "flower." She really did have a face like a flower. This script is made with voices, said Hana Motoki. I understood when I read it. I heard many voices calling out to me. For example, there was a 19-year-old boy. "Amakusa, Kumamoto Prefecture" When I pulled the letter out of the mailbox the slightly plump envelope held hope and uncertainty and a sense of solace that might make my heart sigh with relief. As incendiary bombs poured down, the boy stood by the bomb shelter... And poured buckets of water over the people inside. Somebody asked him... "What's your name?" someone asked. Satoru Tanigawa. He replied. In the face of death, the purpose of the war meant nothing to him. He just desperately poured water over the people. To keep them alive. Then Hana said... I know him well. That was my encounter with this young man. So we decided to produce a play based on this script of voices. If you come to feel like it why don't you come visit my hometown to see this play? It'll be performed on the night of the Nagaoka fireworks. I want you to see the fireworks too. Fireworks in the memory of the air raid victims. The fireworks are a prayer. On Dec. 8, 1941 Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, USA. The war it triggered ended on Aug. 15, 1945 with Japan's defeat. That was already 66 years ago. We've forgotten or decided we don't have to know "Is Japan peaceful now?!" and we live here today in a peaceful Japan. "Then... on a riverbank in Sakon" It happened right then. A bomb fell on top of my head. And it was... Right here. The atomic bomb landed. Atomic bomb? Of course it wasn't real. A mock-up atomic bomb. Mock-up? Of the A-bomb? Have you heard of Fat Man? Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima. Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki. The bomb dropped on Nagaoka was a mock-up of Fat Man dropped on Nagasaki. It was big and heavy and fat and looked exactly like the real atomic bomb. Fat Man... The same as Nagasaki... I can't believe it... It was a regular bomb inside. It was also called Pumpkin because it looked like one. The people back then thought it was a huge horrible bomb. And it was dropped here... That day on July 20, 1945 at 8:13 AM... Just around now. The driver's voice sounded like the devil's whisper. Do you know what "kyoshutsu" is? The citizens' offering of precious goods to the nation. Like my grandpa's gold dental fillings. All to win the war. My mother told me. People around here offered potatoes. Potatoes? There was heavy snowfall that year in 1945. When the snow melted, it flooded Shinano River. Most of the fields were flooded. Only the potatoes were ready to harvest. That day too, farmers were in the fields for the country. To dig up potatoes... They were oblivious of the siren and continued to work hard. And then... Clank clank! They heard a loud noise. The clanking noise continued for 40 seconds. It was the sound of the huge bomb piercing the air. It made a hole 20 meters in diameter and 5 meters deep right here. The older brother's lower body was ripped off "Gosaku Yokoi, age 20 at death" "Yosaku Yokoi, age 15 at death" and the younger brother was torn in pieces. He didn't look human anymore. Over there, the young mother was collapsed "Toyono Kamio, age 30 at death" without a head. The baby was blown away but survived and her cries echoed through the air. Her head and face were plastered with mud and her mother's blood. They encrusted on her and wouldn't come off no matter how much they washed her. Even though babies... have nothing to do with war. We have nothing to do with war. But... now... But now... A connection is beginning to form with the war. Even to me, who had nothing to do with war. Good morning. Good morning. Hello. One of the members who built the memorial here. He's one too. This man is also a main member. I just made a small contribution. Sorry I'm late. I had things to do at the shelter. We had a meeting about community building with the evacuees. Freshly harvested. My hoe hit it something in the ground. Potatoes? I don't use a hoe for potatoes. The mice started noticing the fat yakons. Yakons? A cross between a potato and daikon radish. I dug a little deep and found this. He was trying to get rid of mice. They should've waited until winter for the big yakons. What is it? A bomblet of an E46 incendiary cluster bomb. Incendiary cluster bomb? I was just telling her. It's a little bomb that's part of a big bomb. This is Mr. Mishima, a military history researcher. This is Mr. Matsushita. I dig up potatoes. He's also a triathlete. Do you know about incendiary bombs? Just the term. How about B-29? Also just the term. I only know the terms too. That's why I study them. Traditional Japanese houses are made from wood and paper. Light a match and start a fire. Houses burned down fast. People burned with them. Bombs tailor-made for Japanese culture. Culture? Civilization is the attacker. Culture is the attacked. Right? One B-29 carried up to 40 cluster incendiary bombs. When dropped, the propeller fuse was activated and the bombs were scattered from 1,500 meters in the air. Scattered? Scattered and opened. 4 strips of gauze came out from here which controlled the velocity of the drop. That's how it worked? When they flew into roofs or the ground the explosive charge in the tip burst and ignited the napalm. Napalm? Jellied gasoline. It showered down on and burned humans too. Even the roofs of bomb shelters. They were very efficient. 163,000 were dropped on Nagaoka. 2 per person. What a waste. Will you take it to the office? Sure. There are more around? Yeah, they're everywhere. Around here, the war isn't over yet. The war isn't over yet. Incendiary bombs are still dug up from the fields in Nagaoka. Come visit the war museum. I'll show you around after the evacuees' meeting. Thank you. Will you send 2 buses around? Nagaoka was burned to the ground on Aug. 1. 14 days before Japan surrendered. Fat Man was dropped 10 days before Nagaoka. Why Nagaoka and not Niigata? Niigata is a major city. Because Nagaoka is the birthplace of Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto. Oh... That's right. The locals believed it was retaliation for the attack on Pearl Harbor. But it wasn't. Mr. Matsushita, the man who dug up the incendiary bomb... The woman whose head was blown off was his aunt. The baby survived but it must have been difficult. The father held the baby and dove in front of an oncoming train. Where are you from? Pardon me... Mr. Akiyoshi Muraoka... I saw your name plate. I was named after Tsugunosuke Kawai whose real name was Akiyoshi. He was from Nagaoka. A top-ranking samurai of the Echigo Nagaoka clan. He advocated the clan's neutrality in the Boshin War "Tsugunosuke Kawai of the Nagaoka Clan" but was not accepted by the new national army. He was shot by a stray bullet and died from gangrene. He hated fighting and my mother always used to say "Be like Tsugunosuke and be friendly to each other." Friendly to each other... Yes. I'm Reiko Endo from Amakusa. Amakusa... In Kumamoto prefecture a town called Ushibuka that rests by a beautiful sea. Ushibuka... It merged with the city of Amakusa in 2006. You came a long way. But my real hometown is Nagasaki. The city where the real Fat Man was dropped. Nagasaki? They were going to drop a real atomic bomb on the city of Niigata too. The neighboring city? Many residents of the city don't know about it. The mock-up that was dropped here was not for retaliation but as a trial for dropping the real one over Niigata. A trial with the mock-up? Actually, 49 mock-ups were dropped all over Japan before we lost the war. But we only found out about them recently. Niigata too... Before Nagasaki became a target. I didn't know that. My journey to Nagaoka started off with a horrible, mysterious day like a nightmare. When the Fat Man mock-up was dropped over Nagaoka Chosei Bridge was mistaken for Zao Bridge and instead of the industrial zone, it landed in the fields. Bombers returned on July 26 but due to the weather the bombs were dropped over Kanose and Kashiwazaki. Niigata was spared because of these 2 mistakes. 6 days later B-29 bombers attacked Nagaoka with incendiary bombs. That script by Hana Motoki writes in great detail about Nagaoka during the war. But strangely, she knows nothing about the fireworks today. There, I can help... You worked on the Phoenix fireworks after the Chuetsu Earthquake. They asked me because I was on the project committee but... That firework craftsman, what is he like? Seijiro Nose is a legend and he's... straightforward. A man with a sense of humor who acts serious. He's 88 but seems much younger. I'm looking forward to the fireworks too. I'll watch the fireworks and your play. Is this your first time? You're from Niigata, right? I've never seen the Nagaoka fireworks. My wife and kids have but Niigata and Nagaoka are actually far apart. Niigata is a major port city. But Nagaoka is... But after what happened this year there's something special about the fireworks. You're from the mountains of Yamakoshi. I moved here when the Phoenix fireworks were launched. When Yamakoshi merged with Nagaoka the year after the Chuetsu Earthquake. Your 7th year here? But I've visited before though. Sure, you can't worry about everything all the time. So what? The essence of fireworks is... Radiation level is normal. Essence of fireworks? They're launched at night. Yes, usually. Strontium for red, copper for blue, barium for green. Sodium for yellow, titanium for gold. The compounds? It's the craftsmen's trade secret. Many chemicals for just one color. - First, the stars. - Stars? - Like mustard flower seeds. - Yes. Mix them with water and a pyrotechnic composition. - They form spheres. - Spheres? From 1cm to 4cm in diameter. 4cm for the 90cm shells? Like this. The 90cm shell. For one that changes from red to yellow to blue the chemicals are used in reverse order, from blue to yellow to red. Like candy with layers of different colors. This is education too. The dried stars are placed in half a shell. So is the bursting charge, which ignites the stars. Wine cork is sometimes used for the core. A firework's effect depends on how they're placed. For a beautiful shape when it opens up. - And scattered. - Scattered and opened. Bombs have the same mechanism. Technically speaking, they're both explosives. One good, one bad. Lastly, paper is pasted on the surface of the shell. Another technique? A thin layer makes it fast. Boom and it's gone. I see. Fireworks embody the spirit of the Japanese. But Mr. Seijiro Nose... - Mr. Atsumi! - I'm coming. I'm supervising the cleaning. It's like war too. May God prosper our arms. Charge forward! He's the king of trivia. Did you know all that? No, I just gathered the funds. So the essence of fireworks? Mr. Nose likes fireworks that open up slowly. Yes, that's what he said. I went with him. Slowly? It's not just about fireworks anymore. If you ask me "Legendary firework craftsman Seijiro Nose" I like to make fireworks that open up slowly and smoothly. Because I think smooth fireworks tug gently at people's hearts. Here you go. It was an extremely hot day. Traditional Japanese paper had long fibers unlike modern craft paper. So the fireworks opened up slowly like paper falling apart. We used to use old notebooks and calendars. They had flavor. The melon was delicious. Everything was slow in the old days. Please eat as much as you want. We're sorry our house is so small. It's fine... It was ruined by the big snowfall of 1963. It's about 200 years old. It used to be a big house. Our ancestors were fugitives of the Taira Clan. After they lost in the great war they hid by the river and became farmers. In my grandfather's days, we owned around 6 acres of land. A stubborn man. He built embankments around his firework workshop. They dug holes in those embankments and used them as bomb shelters during the war. My grandfather... I'm the head of the Nose family. Come attack me! I'm not afraid of B-29s. To hell with America. I'm Japanese male! Seijiro in the battlefield! Go get them! "Seijiro in the battlefield at that time" Making fireworks was a hobby. It was my great grandfather. When Nagaoka Castle was conquered... I bestow this chest onto you. From a man named Nagino of the Nagaoka Clan he received a chest as a keepsake. Inside, he found notes on firework compounds. It was long ago. Long ago, society and people's lives were laid-back. Fireworks and Nagaoka's history are starting to connect. My grandfather was tall and handsome. He was popular with the geishas. Fireworks used to be displayed to please the geishas. The men wanted to show off. One summer, after the offering of 2 rounds of fireworks to a shrine he got drunk and fell asleep and started to snore. Nothing out of the ordinary but he died in his sleep. His name was Tsurukichi, dead at age 84. My father's name was Makoto. An earnest man who was always smiling. He was polite and never got angry. He didn't drink either. Fireworks turned into a side business of his. This is Yae. She's like a monkey. I try to be someone in between my grandfather and father. Hot! You don't like it hot but I'm sure our guests do. Please, while it's hot. My grandfather doted on me and I was a mischievous kid. We used to steal gunpowder and threw it in the pond and let it explode. Then fish would float up. They were tasty, too. We'd also bury gunpowder and pretend they were land mines and make bottle rockets out of bamboo. We experimented. It was fun trying things out. My father always used to say to me... Be a great man like General Nogi. He'd say. The Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937. When the war escalated fireworks in Nagaoka were launched to send off the soldiers. I too was sent off on April 10, 1943 as a member of the 158th infantry regiment. I was healthy and received a Class-A certification. I think more fireworks were launched for me than anyone else. At Jo-oka Station, which is now North Nagaoka Station my father stayed until I was gone. He didn't say a word. If only there was no war... The connection between fireworks and war became stronger. We were hit and punched and given no meals. The military code of honor was drilled into us. The look in our eyes changed. "A soldier must be brave." "A soldier must be frugal." From Habomai to Shikotan to Kamchatka. On a deserted island in the middle called Matsuwa Island through air raids and naval gunfire by the Americans I ran carrying messages. All the telephone lines were destroyed. Suicide missions. It was like running through fireworks. Through fireworks... I kept at it because I wanted to move up the ladder. Private 2nd Class to 1st Class. Then Corporal. A soldier one rank above you is like a god to you. When Japan was defeated on Aug. 15, 1945 we soldiers weren't informed but we knew. We were suddenly shipped off to Siberia to work 8 hours a day in the freezing cold. With my physical constitution, I can gain weight with water. I have strong stomach that absorbs everything. After 3 years over there I was finally able to come back to Japan. "Apple's Song" was popular at the time. My father was doing well but Nagaoka was burned to the ground. In August 1946, a year after the air raid an honorable man named Juzaburo Hanagata who later became the president of Niigata TV Station organized a festival promoting the city's recovery. The following year in August 1947 fireworks were launched in the city of Nagaoka. After our defeat in the Boshin War Torasaburo Kobayashi told the hungry warriors who demanded the 100 sacks of rice received as consolation that for Nagaoka's recovery, we have to think not only about today but about the children's happiness in the future. He sold the sacks of rice and used the money for education. We must follow his principle and do something to revive Nagaoka. Recovery means to raise the children well to become good human beings. Let's let the fireworks go bang and enliven our spirits. Bang! Bang! He's talking too much and your tea has gone cold. Eat the cake. We got married in 1951. That year, we got a big job. A mortar for launching 90cm shell was found by Shinano River. A chunk of steel 4 meters long and weighing 3.5 tons. At first, we were going to offer it to the army but it was too heavy. The cylinder was upside down and on the bottom, there was a drawing of a face. It looked sad. "Let's use this and revive the 90 cm-diameter shells." The city employees asked us and my father said... Shall we then? Mumbling and grumbling from the moment we woke up until we fell sleep we thought only about the firework. It was the Thousand Ring Chrysanthemum. We conducted a purification ceremony and said our prayers. Then the siren was alarmed. Like that night, the lights in the town were turned off. 10:30 PM, the time of the air raid. It was launched downstream from Chosei bridge. It was amazing. It burst open. Yes! It was a great wedding anniversary. On the same night as the air raid. Hello. Our daughter Fumiko. Thanks for your help with the Phoenix fireworks. Hello. Hello, Mr. Katayama. You know each other? Excuse me. Yasuo, her brother. Hello. By Kiyoshi Yamashita? They're fireworks composed of torn pieces of colored paper. But my father kicked him off the site. Kicked him off? I learned about him later. I wanted his piece of work so I bought this. If people made pretty fireworks instead of bombs there wouldn't have been any wars. It's a "fox's wedding." Do you know what a "fox's wedding" is? I heard the phrase a lot when I was a kid. Kiyoshi Yamashita one day said, "Which firework festival should I go to this summer?" Then he passed away. My fireworks bloom and disappear in the sky. He composed his portraits after they disappeared. And they became prayers. Fireworks disappear but they revive. This year when the fireworks are launched Mr. Yamashita will be somewhere in Japan. A day like this is rare when the sunset feels so gentle. Even around here. Japan's history is embedded in this man's life as it is in Nagaoka's fireworks. Finally, a connection between the fireworks and our lives today. "Morning of July 21, 2011" INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED ON INTERNAL RADIATION EXPOSURE Internal radiation exposure... Good morning. Good morning. I'm sorry. Did you wait? You knew it was me? Yes, I guessed. I'm sorry I called out of the blue. You took me by surprise and I couldn't say anything. Plus... I have to wait for you to speak to me first. "Objectives of the Phoenix fireworks" Your first time in Nagaoka? The fireworks are launched every year on Aug. 2 and 3? The city was burned down twice in two wars. Not on a weekend. They're not for tourists. They're launched on Aug. 1 too, but only three. The 90cm shells. Only 3 because some people remember the air raid and get afraid. Afraid? Before the 90cm shells are launched, the siren is set off. It reminds them of the war. Those are the voices I wanted to hear. Voices of people I've never met. I'm Reiko Endo. I'm Wakako Inoue. No... I want us to be friends without all that. Before I decided to come here, I read all the local newspapers. I'm a reporter too so they give me the best insight about the city. I'm glad you did. That's Hirakata Shrine. Hirakata Shrine... This is the place? That gate collapsed too. In the air raid? No, in the Chuetsu Earthquake. It all began when I heard that voice here. That voice? "Bomb shelters provide safety." That's what people believed. There was a big one in this shrine too. Everybody was roasted to death in the bomb shelter. Bodies were piled on top of one another. The ones on the top were burnt and charred black. "Yasu Yoshizawa (74) recalls scene in bomb shelter" The ones under them were roasted and yellow-brown. And bloated. The ones on the bottom were green. They were crushed to death. You couldn't tell which body was whose. It feels like yesterday. I saw it. 13-year-olds at the time didn't know how babies were born. But a baby was halfway out from between the legs of its mother whose body was burnt black. The baby was also burnt black. All I can do now is to pass on the story as long as I'm alive and I have my voice. What do you want to do first? Walk around like you did. After I started the column I walked along Kaki River many times. Silly, isn't it? My mom's lunch bag. She wants me to carry around food for emergencies. Actually it's pretty good. Ever since the earthquake? The war... No, earlier than that. It was my grandmother's idea. "Niina" and butterbur sprout... My mom picks them in the mountain and cooks them. What's "niina"? Boiled vegetables. Usually "taina" leaves but they're not in season right now. In Nagaoka, we say "nina" but it's "niina" in my mother's dialect. She's from Tochio on Kariyata River, a village of weavers. Wakako... Are you involved with anyone? Recently... I had my heart broken. The column and the reporter's name jumped right into my eyes. The title was "There's Still Time Until a War." Time for what until a war? To do what after making it in time for a war? My parents were A-bomb survivors in Nagasaki. They're the ones that have experienced war and not me. "Ushibuka, city of Amakusa" Between my mother and me there was always a tiny ache like a hangnail. Two springs ago, she was spending her last quiet days on this earth. Knowing we wouldn't be living together for long I wanted to make normal conversations of a mother and daughter. I found out she couldn't ride a bicycle. I found out she wasn't too happy about my being a reporter. "There's Still Time Until a War"... What an extraordinary title. I covered the Great East Japan Earthquake. I wrote about its horrors but they weren't my experiences. In fact, I was the one encouraged by the victims. Being heartbroken helped too. Heartbroken? I wanted to think things over and I chopped off my hair. I know what you mean. Natural disasters are harsh on us small humans but people say they create miracles. Miracles? People's beauty and cleverness... Enduring, giving and accepting, and being grateful... We see people's goodness that's usually hidden or forgotten. People all over the world were moved by the Japanese and offered their support. The disaster victims' courage, cleverness and beauty will be the driving force of Japan's recovery. In contrast, damages from war only create hatred. War, the worst possible man-made disaster, creates nothing. I'm a reporter who has seen both types of disasters and I wanted to think seriously about war. That's why the title "There's Still Time Until a War." I had a feeling since 2 or 3 years ago that the elderly people were starting to talk about the war. There's still time? Until the next war that might break out. Next war? It's possible. It's not impossible. We've never experienced war. We actually have something to do with it after all. The day was a "fox's wedding," in other words, a sun shower. "Late spring 2009 Reiko's house in Ushibuka" Mom, more tea? Thanks. Everyone's practicing for the Haiya Festival. You're going out to work in this rain? Everyone's in high spirit. Reiko... Yeah? What are you going to do from now on by yourself? What do you mean? My health has been frail since birth. But I gave you a healthy body. I was 40 and your father was ecstatic. I know... Thanks. You should be thanked too. Life is connected. Mom... I was scared. I couldn't see anything. The war... The atomic bomb... I couldn't see anything. What I couldn't see the most at the time... was my life. It hurts. I was running away. I don't think I can make it right again. This rain hurts! I was a coward. How about minced meat cutlet today? That's fine. Using fresh oil, right? Of course. Living half a year on the southern wind The other half year Sleeping all day long Haiya-bushi is a folk song and dance from your village, right? It'll be summer again soon. Mom... How old were you in Nagasaki when they dropped the bomb? I was 13. If I can still dance like this, my life has been good. So I'll keep on dancing. Mom... You're so brave. "June 11, 2011" "18 years ago in Tokyo" How about becoming a mother soon? We... have nothing to do with war. After I started reading the column "There's Still Time Until a War" in the Nagaoka newspaper I mustered the courage to write him a letter. Because the title of his play written by that girl named Hana had the same title "There's Still Time Until a War." It was an unusual script set by a small river called Kaki River. But somehow, I was convinced it had to be made into a play. There were voices, lots of imploring voices. What is this urge? If possible, Reiko, I want to seek its meaning with you. I don't know how long it'll take but I want to think it over with you. After I left Amakusa, I made a stop in Nagasaki. "Atomic bomb dropped over Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945" It's my parents' hometown but I had never visited it. "Atomic Bomb Museum" I realize I really had been running away. In the Atomic Bomb Museum in Nagasaki I encountered the full-scale model of Fat Man that devastated the city. The mechanism of the bomb looked like that of the fireworks that I'd later see in Nagaoka Station. Next, I visited Hiroshima. "Atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945" It was my second time but I gazed at the Peace Memorial like it was my first. A departure but a homecoming... A journey to discover my soul... It was the entrance into Wonderland. So this is where they're putting on that play with the same title. Yes. The newspaper and I are backing them up. Is that so? I got a call asking if it was okay about the same title. The girl... A girl wrote it? That's what I heard. I heard a high school teacher called Katayama wrote it. Mr. Katayama... Wakako, why do you know about Kenichi?! I wonder if it was her... Sure, go ahead and do it. Please do it. "Mid May 2011" Thank you. That's great. Mr. Katayama will be happy. Where is the stage going to be? There in Forest of Peace Park. We need funds. Will you do a newspaper campaign? Are you really a high school student? Definitely a high school student. Do you want to see my ID? That's not necessary. Okay, I'll do it. They're shutting down the nuclear plants. I'm not surprised. - I have a question. - Go ahead. Why do you want to put on this play? To make people hear the voices. That's difficult. We can do it. Sincere thoughts. If we really wish it, it'll happen. All right, you're on. I've been thinking for a long time. You started that column so finally me too. You what? Was the girl's name Hana Motoki? You really are a reporter. You did your research. Wakako, I'm sorry about that insensitive question earlier. When I was about your age, I too went through a nasty break-up. That's why I became a reporter. Without a medium it's hard to find the courage to openly express yourself. After the recent earthquake Niigata was the first to offer aid to the victims. We're repaying the kindness that was shown to us. I want to get close to real people. I've been thinking that. What kind of reporter are you? From a small newspaper in Amakusa. I went to China. China? A small island called Hainan in the Guandong Province. 34,000 square kilometers in size. Yes, information must be accurate. I visited the "Apo," the old woman in Chinese term. The comfort women for the Japanese soldiers. Comfort women... Girls were taken from their homes. Now they're old women. They wouldn't speak of what happened. I wanted to hear their voices. I have no homeland I can go back to. I'd like to visit Amakusa. My grandpa died in Malacca during World War II. My grandmother was killed in the bombing of Nagasaki. I never knew her. Really? I'm a second generation survivor. Is that right? Nobody can say they have nothing to do with war. I came here feeling the same way. Reiko... You weren't heartbroken. You loved a man. I'm not sure. Did you hear his voice? He was so close yet far away. Toward the end of WWII between 10:30 PM on Aug. 1 to 0:10 AM on Aug. 2, 1945 Nagaoka was attacked by 125 American B-29 bombers. They dropped around 163,000 rounds and 925 tons of incendiary bombs. 1,480 people were killed and 11,986 homes, which made up 80% of the urban district, were burned down. My father felt very heavy. The feeling of the weight of his dead body is still in my arms even after 66 years. In contrast, my older sister was horribly light. She was burnt and her body was half charcoal. My younger sister... This is my sister, right?! She cried and cried. She was a kind, caring sister. A little after 9:00, the warning siren was switched to the air-raid siren. Wearing boots my sister laid out for us we fled into the bomb shelter in our yard. Then incendiary bombs came flying through the roof. My leg! That voice is my last memory of her. My father was a strict man who used to tell us to sit straight when the national anthem was played on the radio. He loved his family. He carried my sister on his back and we ran from the bomb shelter but we got separated. I want to forget about the night but if I don't tell the story "Sumio Shinkai, 75" my father and my sister will scold me. I know. I was 11 at the time. "Yasunari Honmura, 75" Old Auntie Yone was bawling, her face all wrinkled up. If only I knew I would've brought at least my daughter's arm with me! She cried. She was so kind, giving us sugared and salted well water. She was separated from her family and found the remains of her 4 daughters in Hirakata Shrine 2 days later. When she came back with a cart to claim their bodies they were already cremated with the other bodies. After all, 267 people died there. Oh... this little kid here is me. I watched Auntie Yone from below like this. Through my drawings, I want to tell the children of today. Why did they all have to die that day? Right? I know him. July 28, 1945... It's my birthday. The air raid over Nagaoka was 4 days later. My father, older brother, older sister and 3 cousins who were home at the time were killed. I was still in the hospital where I was born. My mother didn't want my face to get scarred so she shielded my face while we fled. My oldest brother was a mobilized student and was in the dormitory and survived. When we came home, he found 6 charred bodies in the field behind the house. He made a bonfire and cremated them right there. Their ashes were still warm when he put them in the box and took it to my mother. They spent the night crying. My mother has passed away and I also lost my brother to cancer. So now I tell the story in place of my mother and brother. I feel as though "Yoshie Yamafuji, 66" that's why I was born on that day. I know her too. Ordinary lives are suddenly destroyed. Time spent with the family... Everything was turned to ash. My brother and I were told that our mother was by Kaki River. "Fumihiko Sato, 81" We found her naked. Her clothes had burnt off. Her hair was too. She was charred black and lying in mud. My brother and I grabbed her arms to pull her up but her skin peeled off like gloves. Our mother noticed us. Her last will was "you brothers be good to each other." We took her home after that. I grew up wanting to help unfortunate people of the world and became a priest. I know him too. It used to belong to my brother. "Akira Takada, 71" The body was charred black and I couldn't recognize him. He was holding this saxophone, which he used to prize so that's how I knew it was him. After the war, when I was looking through the rubble I found this fuse from an incendiary bomb. I was just a kid. I was playing with it when it suddenly went boom. You only need one hand for a trumpet but you need both hands to play woodwind instruments. If I could play this loud and clear my brother will come back. That's how I feel. Write a good article. I know him well too. The fireworks of Nagaoka remind me of the bombs. That's why I can't enjoy them from the bottom of my heart. "Liliko Motoki, 87" Frightening. War terrorizes so many more people than the ones who die on the battlefields or in air raids. My baby too... who died on my back... I know them all. "Early June 2011" Hey, watch out! - Wanna try? - Try what? After you crashed into me, now what? Because it's fun. Come on... I wanted to meet you. Why? Because you don't know. I have a lot of things I want to tell you. About what? And I don't know anything about the things you know. You're weird. I'm so glad we meet. It hurts. YAMAKOSHI IS ROOTING FOR EAST JAPAN! "July 24 (Sun)" It feels strange going to Yamakoshi with you. Why? My ex-boyfriend was also from Yamakoshi. Also? Yours too, right? Mr. Katayama. I'm right, aren't I? Did I say that? I guessed. No wonder you were heartbroken. You're too intuitive. Yamakoshi has deep valleys and mountains covered with fields. The proper attire for Yamakoshi. Beautiful. Japan... Japan. This is what it looked like in the old picture books. We tend to forget about the old Japan. "A village sunken during the earthquake revived by people's hard work" It's left as it was after it happened. Left as it was? After the Chuetsu Earthquake, a lot of people came to our aid. A piece of bread, a ball of rice... He said it's so that we don't forget what happened. The man you loved? The house was buried in snow. Snow... Yamakoshi has the beauty of the 4 seasons of Japan. The children are lively. They're one with nature. Even after the disaster... At 5:56 PM on Oct. 23, 2004 a huge earthquake hit the Chuetsu region, where we live. The earth roared loudly. The houses shook like pudding and windows shattered. That violent tremor shook our hearts that lay half dormant in us. It re-awakened the Japanese virtue of putting others before oneself. "Everything will be fine. Let's hang in there." I promised myself that I'll never forget how important it is for people to encourage and support each other. "Bury our village if it will save the people downstream." "Then we'll build a new village," said one old man. "Haruzo Matsuo Our house submerged in water" One man put a photo of his sunken home on his name card. Magobei here was rescued by a helicopter after the Chuetsu Earthquake. A miracle, wasn't it? Build a good town for the children. It's what we adults can do for them. It was revived only 2 years after the quake. Aren't they all lively? The bulls are Yamakoshi's pride and joy. So the adults started the Phoenix Project to launch the fireworks again. They gathered funds. Let's launch the Nagaoka fireworks and our thoughts into the sky. Like the 100 sacks of rice after the Boshin War and the fireworks for recovery from the defeat in WW2 let's learn from how our forefathers encouraged the children of Nagaoka. That was the Phoenix fireworks. The symbol of eternal life. The year after the quake, the Phoenix was launched. Wakako... So why... Why did you and Mr. Katayama break up? Oh my gosh, no! You must be kidding. Wakako... Mr. Katayama is a wonderful gentleman but he's too old for me. This is funny. I'd like to know what happened to you two but I won't ask. What happened to me happens all the time. Sure, I took it pretty hard but... These days, I can hear his voice. They expected 20% of the residents at most to come back. But in the end, 80% did. They created this beautiful nature. That's the power of "home." He was also on the Phoenix committee. He made picture storybooks about recovery. He always ate half the lunch my mother made for me. You eat half. When we broke up... It's no use doing the same thing. Let's eat separate lunches. I didn't understand at the time. He now volunteers at a nursing home in Fukushima. Look at what just came. Messages from well-wishers. Niigata's Sado Okesa is a variation of Haiya-bushi from Amakusa. It was probably brought here to the north on trade ships. We're all connected in some way. Do you want to go see Mr. Katayama? His house is not far from here. That night, I stayed in an inn that finally reopened after the earthquake. There were still signs of the disaster but this hot spring is nature's blessing. "There's Still Time Until a War" We started rehearsing the play on July 19. Exactly 66 years ago today "U.S. Declares an Air Strike Scene" General H.H. Arnold of the U.S. Army made the following declaration. Today, August 1, 1945, is hereby declared the date of establishment of the U.S. Army Air Forces. We the United States Army Air Forces will use all our resources available and launch an air raid on Japan. To the citizens of Japan! Read this leaflet if you want to save yours and your precious one's lives. Within a few days, the military facilities listed on the back... These are propaganda flyers. Must be destroyed. The leaflets forewarning an attack on Nagaoka were for threatening the Japanese army and sapping its fighting spirit. There are military facilities and factories in this city. We Americans will destroy... When Nagaoka was attacked, its name had been removed from the leaflets. Bombs can't see and don't know where they'll land. So evacuate from the cities that are listed on the back. The truth is always hidden from us but projects the cruelest sights. What's that crap? From my school back home. I can't wear it here. You're an evacuee from Fukushima. Yes, from Minami Soma, the town right next to the nuclear plants. Nagaoka has taken in close to 1,000 of us. Hi, Ryo! Hello. You can use this bike. RETURNING KINDNESS RECEIVED AFTER THE CHUETSU EARTHQUAKE Really? We will annihilate Japan with military force. So how do you like this play? I don't know anything about war and it's never crossed my mind. Unconditional surrender by Japan or its complete destruction. Many people died here during the air raid. It's the citizens' duty to tell the story. There are adults who think war is necessary but not the children. Of course. That's why it's up to the children to make peace. "And July 24 the rehearsal continues" Everybody, come out. That day, on August 1, 1945 "Arrival of Enemy Planes Scene" not only Nagaoka but Mito, Toyama, Hachioji and other cities were targets of indiscriminate air raids. Put them in the middle. "10:30 PM" 66 years later, in the evening of Aug. 1, 2011 this performance by the students will be watched by many Nagaoka citizens. Everybody dies one day. However! However! - I heard from my grandma. - My uncle. - I heard from my grandpa. - My great grandpa. - I heard by Kaki River. - On Chosei Bridge. - Everybody didn't die. - Didn't die. - Everybody was killed. - Killed. By war! They were killed by war! I wonder if they're shooting up fireworks again this year... "Power of Imagination Scene" Izuho, go up the slope. You too, Aya. Rui, you too. B-29 bombers are here! When I went outside I saw red and blue lights in the sky! People must have held their breaths. Wondering what was about to happen... Aya, a little faster. Hana... Yes? Do you know when people feel afraid? No. It's when their imagination can't catch up. Imagination can't catch up? The cruelest thing one can do to others is to take away their imagination. What is kindness and compassion? Imagination about others. When it's gone it's terrifying. It's unthinkable. I never noticed her in the school before. Poet Daigaku Horiguchi is also from Nagaoka. His ancestors were Nagaoka Clan members. He wrote this poem about the Daigo Fukuryu Maru incident. It happened on Bikini Atoll in 1954. "You tamed the sun inside a nuclear reactor" The thermonuclear test by the Americans. A member of a tuna fishing boat died from radiation syndrome. "You were able to kill God with the power of science" It triggered an anti- thermonuclear movement. But the U.S. paid $2 million in compensation and Japan discontinued the investigation and people soon forgot about it. "Trembling with fear about a nuclear doomsday" "It is time to make the decision" His father works at the nuclear power plant in Kashiwazaki. They're taking in those who lost their jobs at the Fukushima plant. He's proud of that. But recently he and his friends have started pondering their future. Then his father brought him here. Think by yourselves. You can create your own future. A better era. It was their wish too. Tsuginosuke, Isoroku, Daigaku... Nagaoka citizens who hoped for peace. This is Isoroku's grave. It was horrible after the Chuetsu Earthquake. The people of Nagaoka helped its restoration. It took a year and a half. I was a rookie reporter at the time. I was so ambitious. Yeah, I was too. A diary by Isoroku's friend was discovered recently. It describes how he was opposed to the war against the U.S. to the very end. The diary belonged to Mr. Teikichi Hori of Oita Prefecture. Like Isoroku, he was opposed to the war against the U.S. On the fateful day of the attack on Pearl Harbor he saw the marshal off at Yokohama Station. Isoroku's last words were "Thanks. I may not be able to come home." "Take good care of your wife." And there's justice even in war. That's what we learned as children. For example, you don't attack a hospital ship. Cultural assets belong to the world and must be protected by both sides. That's why Kyoto and Nara weren't targeted. That's what I thought. But Kyoto, like Hiroshima, was a Class AA target of the atomic bomb. They didn't attack the prime target because they wanted to test the bomb's damage on it. Nagasaki was bombed instead of Kokura because there was poor visibility over Kokura. They stopped the Nagaoka fireworks the year I was born. Really? I was born in 1938. I was moved by the movie "Naval Battles of Hawaii and Malay." About the attack on Pearl Harbor? The great victories of Japan. We thought our army was always winning like the movies. That's what the papers said. I wonder how the reporters felt, thinking we were going to lose. Well, it was a war. We had to win. We had to win... But we lost. Even children know what happens if we lose. It's over for Japan. I was ready to be killed. But so quickly after that... A strange, unexpected peace. Strange... Americans thought the Japanese had the mentality of a 12-year-old. 12? Chocolate and chewing gum and American movies... They were so fun and cheerful. The Japanese quickly fell in love with America. Dark in here, isn't it? After March 11, the whole city became dark. When I was a child it was always this dark so I feel comfortable. No trouble at all. Are you feeling nostalgic? Humans are feeling nostalgic. There was nothing wrong with this darkness. Japan became bright because it imitated the U.S. Like idol worship. But people were afraid too. When a civilization is too advanced it will someday bring on the downfall of mankind. Like in Osamu Tezuka's sci-fi cartoons. Osamu Tezuka... "Astro Boy"... President Eisenhower gave a speech titled "Atoms for Peace." Astro Boy and Astro Girl flying hand in hand... Nuclear power for peace. Hiroshima's A-bomb was made with uranium. Nagasaki's with plutonium. The peace sign was a performance by British PM Churchill. Peace brought on by the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki... The V is for "victory." If victory is peace, wars will never end. After we lost the war, we Japanese kept blindly imitating the winners. Peace... The V sign is peace for the winners. In my younger days, I was so eager to go. "Zenjiro Hanyu Yamamoto Isoroku Museum" To the U.S.? In 1965 when I was 27, I stopped over in Pearl Harbor too. It was amazing. It was so colorful just like the American movies. We only knew Pearl Harbor from the black-and-white photos. It was beautiful and the world felt peaceful. But in the mainland... "My son died in Perl Harbor." "My father was killed." I was kicked out of the hotel. "Nagaoka Air Raid Illustrations" The war wasn't over in the U.S. After 9/11 terrorist attacks, they said "Remember Pearl Harbor." It's said that they killed Bin Laden for the same reason they killed Isoroku. The war isn't over in the U.S. In Nagaoka, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki too. Tokyo too and the rest of the world. Nowadays we Japanese kill each other, even friends and family. We have no right preaching about peace. This March, a 200-member delegation from Nagaoka paid a goodwill visit to Honolulu to launch fireworks as a sign of U.S.-Japan friendship. It was March 10. The fireworks had to be cancelled because of the 3/11 quake. The tsunami hit Hawaii. And it even reached California. It was too bad but it's not over. There's the main event. Pearl Harbor was attacked on Dec. 8. On Dec. 8 in Pearl Harbor we'll launch fireworks by Japan and the U.S. in memory of the deceased. As a Nagaoka citizen, I want Isoroku's wish to finally come true. It's been 66 years since that day. Japan has to start over from the day it lost the war. We have to use the pain caused by war for peace. "Hana's Scene" Voices yelling. Voices crying. Voices calling names. Voices looking for people. Pour water over yourselves! No! Not the bomb shelters! Has anyone seen my child? Has anyone seen my brother? Has anyone seen my leg? Will someone explain what this is? - To Kaki River! - Run! The bull is running madly through the fire. All the bomb shelters are full and I couldn't get in. Hundreds of incendiary bombs were stuck in the ground. Someone got hit by one and was torn apart. - We ran. - We ran like mad. - Not knowing what to do. - Not knowing what will be. What is it, Hana? What's happened, Hana? Run! Get out of here! "10:45 PM Running to Kaki River" "Liliko and Hana's Scene" Father! Watch your step. Mom! Hana! Mom! Hana! Mom! Hana! Hana! Hana! "August 1, 1945" A tall unicycle... A tall, tall unicycle... Hana's unicycle. I want you to listen to her story. Liliko Motoki's story. Hello. That lady is Ms. Liliko Motoki and today she's going to tell you her story about the war using picture cards. It's an important story so listen carefully and quietly until she's finished. Ms. Motoki, welcome. Hello. "The Story of That Day" My name is Liliko Motoki. You're all sitting on the floor and I wish I could too. But when you're old, your legs start to hurt. So forgive me. Today I'm going to to tell you about my daughter, who died when she was 1 and a half. Can you see over there in the back? Yes, we can. What a nice breeze... Her name was Hana. If she were alive she could have felt this nice breeze too. "The Story about That Day." Dad... Did Hana fall asleep? Not yet. What did Mom say? Nothing. Okay. August 1, 1945. There was very little rainfall that summer and it was very hot. My parents came to see their granddaughter but my mother had already gone home. My father stayed behind in Nagaoka. Outside our yard a tall unicycle passed by. My husband was volunteering at a factory. He always wouldn't be home until late at night. The stars are so pretty tonight. I wish they could see us from the sky too. If they could see you, they wouldn't drop bombs. It was a beautiful night, the stars sparkling in the sky. But suddenly, the siren went off. - I'll bring the lighting stands later. - Okay. You guys okay? "There's Still Time Until a War" Hello. May I sit with you? Sure, please. Thank you. What are you doing? A play. A play about what? My mother and me. And about the war and Nagaoka fireworks. I don't like fireworks. Why not? How old are you? 18. 18... Hey, Hana! When are the lighting stands coming? Mr. Katayama is bringing them this afternoon. Hana? Yes. Is that right? If you don't like fireworks, you must not like flowers. I do like flowers. I love them. Small flowers. Good. What do you do now? I'm a picture-card storyteller. "10:15 PM" It'll be de-activated soon. Liliko, a warning siren. I'll go check. Close the bomb shelter door tightly. Take care of Hana. So I stayed back at the house with my father and my little baby Hana. It was terrifying. The dark shadows of the B-29 bombers were about to fill the sky over Nagaoka. With Hana on my back, my father and I... Let's go in the bomb shelter. Hurry! Don't trip over yourself. Air-raid siren. We hurried into the bomb shelter. Hurry, Dad! We have to shut the door. It's actually no use hiding here. Liliko, watch closely. This is what humans are capable of. No, don't stay there, Mom. Hana! Let's get out and run. For some reason, I felt uncertain so... We can't stay here. We have to get out. I suppose we should. My father and I quickly crawled out of the bomb shelter. Hurry, Dad! Hana was quiet on my back. Hana will get crushed! Let's go to Kaki River. Mitsuko! Let's go. There's Hirakata Shrine. I heard they have a big bomb shelter. What good are they? "Bomb Shelter Scene" We need more water. It's too hot. Are you okay? More water! Run faster! Be strong! Get water! This really happened? Thank you. Water! They're burning! Sorry! Hang in there! You'll be okay! Don't give up! We need more water! Pour some on me! Do you have enough water? Bomb shelters are dangerous! You'll burn to death! - This is like hell! - We can't help you! The boy stood at the entrance under the shower of incendiary bombs and silently and desperately poured buckets of water over the people inside the bomb shelter. You have to live. You have to live or you'll die. They should be rehearsing already. Should we stop by? It's on the way. Hurry up! Here too! Here's water! Hi. - Who are you? - What's your name? You saved our lives. What's your name? Who are you? What's your name? Who are you? What's your name? You saved our lives. What's your name? Who are you? What's your name? Satoru Tanigawa. You're Satoru Tanigawa? You guys, that was great! Good job. You did great. - Hana... - Yeah? What's that "boon boon" you were doing? Do an airplane. Mine goes "boon boon." - That's cute. - Thanks. Reiko, Mr. Katayama was there. I saw him! I heard him too! Yamakoshi used to have terraced rice paddies. From over 200 years ago, they released baby Nishikigoi fish in the paddies. It became serious business with the rice paddy reduction policy. The Chuetsu Earthquake almost destroyed the business but it's again the world's largest breeder of Nishikigoi. - Taking a walk? - Hi, Motoki. Ryo from Fukushima asked me if he could read your script. He did? You really are an odd student. You know all about the past but... - What's his name? - Yasushi. Yasushi, come here. There are 3 of us here. I move away. Now there's a gap between you two. A very sad gap. The world is the same. Gap? The force that fills the gap... Imagination. Imagination... I heard you were going to cancel the Phoenix fireworks. Because of the Great East Japan Earthquake. I see the point but... A woman raised her hand. Go ahead. You must be Ms. Nagashima from Yamakoshi. Most members of the Phoenix Committee feel we should cancel this year's fireworks but I thought we should listen to some comments by the public. I... lost my little niece in the recent Great East Japan Earthquake. My sister's daughter. She was a sweet, thoughtful girl. Her body was badly damaged but her face was peaceful like she was just sleeping. My sister is still in another world. Sometimes she disappears into a world of grief that only she can enter. She's right next to me but in a world far far away. I would like to see the fireworks with my sister. To appreciate their beauty together. Our thoughts can be together. After the Chuetsu Earthquake our Phoenix fireworks must have supported people like that. I want my sister to know that I'm right by her. Especially because of what happened... Especially because... I'm sorry for my selfish remarks. It's irresponsible of me when I have no money to contribute. Hana's story about the war and the story about the Phoenix fireworks are starting to connect. Her dead niece and Yasushi here overlapped in my mind. The gap was filled. Yasushi's mother is my sister who died in the Chuetsu quake. So you joined the committee? I began to see the importance of fireworks. You're stopping the aftershocks in your soul. Motoki... Hana... You should go see Mr. Nose, the firework craftsman. He's a war veteran and the key person of the Nagaoka fireworks. A marshal if you were a soldier. The mock-up bomb was the other Nagaoka air raid. My aunt and my uncle and the "bo"... "Bo"? The baby. None of them knows why they died. Go, dad. Come on, push! "Masae, older sister, 26" The older sister is still alive today. "Sami Imai, the model for this character, is 92 and still alive in 2011" There should never be another war. "Statue of the Legend of the 100 Sacks of Rice" That's Torasaburo Kobayashi. The people of Nagaoka have suffered and survived many wars in the past. They've strived to live. Peach from my friends. Thank you. "Nagaoka War Damage Exhibit Hall" - Welcome. - Hello. My grandfather fought in Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. He always used to say war is fun when you're winning it. He looked happy when he talked of war. He volunteers here. Be someone who despises war even when you win. That's his wish. Mr. Mishima... Starting this year, this exhibit hall has started a Pearl Harbor exhibit in conjunction with a museum in Arizona. We have to start by sharing the painful history with each other. Learn from the pain we both felt. HISTORY OF PEARL HARBOR, THE FIRST EXHIBIT OF DAMAGES CAUSED BY JAPAN You need cleverness and courage to bring about peace. In last year's Peace Forum Pastor Sato talked about the comfort women to middle schoolers. In war, people both cause and incur harm. The inhuman acts especially should not be forgotten so we can learn the senselessness of war. Yes... That's courage. He wants children to learn from the mistakes made by adults. I see. This is a full-scale model of a cluster bomb. It's so big. I'll show you around. So how are you enjoying your sentimental journey? - A journey of emotions. - Emotions? Feeling a mixture of emotions in Nagaoka. Many things have touched my heart deeply. That's a golden peach. This is warship USS Arizona. Golden peach? From Mr. Matsushita's fields. Yes. My fields is this... I have to fix USS Arizona. Wakako said she's sorry to have left you alone. People in the disaster areas of the East Japan Earthquake want the Phoenix fireworks launched in their towns. She went to Fukushima to meet with our friends. Friends in Fukushima? Hello. Photos of the air-raid victims. 1,480 civilians were killed in just one night. The figure could increase if there are new notifications. That one... The mayor of Nagaoka also died in the air raid. He was from Amakusa. Are you serious? This woman here is Liliko Motoki. She tells picture-card stories about her sad experiences during the war. Motoki... It was this baby that passed away. Her name was Hana. She died on her mother's back in Kaki River. The mother wanted to be in the photo with her. Mothers are strong. Hana... Hana Motoki... This baby? These are drawings of people's memories. People who were in their teens. The hole made by the mock-up bomb, now a potato field. And a peach field. A water tank. Bombs look like fireworks when they're drawn. Fleeing from incendiary bombs... This is the old Rokujuku Bank. It withstood the fire. The whole city was burnt down so there's no shadow of the past. This is Nagaoka in 1955. The era still has a gentle and nostalgic atmosphere. When the economy grows, the old Japan becomes lost. It was war of the economy and the nation crumbled. Japan abandoned its old ways and adopted convenience and grew into an economic giant. The recent big quake has gotten us to think. How will the Japanese go on living? We had the ability to survive with nothing but now we've lost ourselves in over-abundance. Nagaoka in the past. Japan was poorer but it seemed better off than now. The Great East Japan Earthquake brought forth the beautiful spirit of Japan. What is real prosperity for this country? We have to think again. Get out of here! You're not allowed in here. - Dad... - What. That uniform is Mr. Katayama's school. Can we help you? Where's your teacher? Go home! Oh, Dad... He kicked out Kiyoshi Yamashita this way too. This place is dangerous! Go away! Can't you hear me?! Get out of here! What's so dangerous about fireworks? Who's Kiyoshi Yamashita? Are you a fool? You don't know that famous artist? You didn't know either. Come back with an adult. There are thing you can only see with your imagination. I hate people who quibble. You use your imagination too, don't you? What? You imagine how people will feel when they see your fireworks. Will they remember people they've forgotten? Will they find their lost treasures? You're a weird kid. People think I'm odd. This paper is no good. It has to be smoother. Do you know about wars? Yes. You do? At your age? If the difference in age means anything it's whether you know or don't know why you have to die. I left my war by river Amur. River Amur? You said "imagination," right? Yes. A prisoner-of-war camp in Siberia, minus 30 degrees. One small piece of black bread. Watery soup with about 5 beans. We were fed livestock feed and every day, one man out of 10 was dead. Can you imagine that? Not yet. In the morning... On a bed... He's gone. He's gone. Oh... Dead... Your friends... You're too desperate trying to stay alive that you forget you're friends. Your souls became hard as a rock. But now, my friends that are deceased come here and help me out. I loved the fireworks over River Amur. Stay healthy and fit. Fireworks again this summer, huh? You hit the very bottom in the war. Then you rose to the sky with the fireworks. Mr. Nose, the firework craftsman in the summer of 1990 in memory of fellow soldiers who died in the POW camp went to River Amur in Khabarovsk and launched fireworks. Are you Hana Motoki? Yes. I wandered into your play rehearsal the other day. I'm glad I got to meet you. I'm happy too. Let's put on a good show on Aug. 1! The day for Nagaoka fireworks! Let's change all the bombs in the world into fireworks and launch them! It's a fox's wedding! The sudden rainstorm in late July turned into a record-breaking rainfall and for 4 days... Shinano River flooded. The venue that was prepared for the big day... was submerged in water and mud. The display of fireworks seemed beyond hope. Yet the mayor of Nagaoka... Mayor! Mayor! A word, please! We'd definitely cancel or postpone them if they were for attracting tourists. But our fireworks are launched in memory of the deceased and as a message for peace. We have to keep sending the message to the world. The fireworks of Nagaoka must be launched at all costs. They're not the greatest fireworks in Japan. They're the greatest in the world. The citizens worked all night to clear the mud from the river and to prepare the field. At 10:30 PM on Aug. 1 the rain miraculously stopped and the fireworks were to be launched as planned. "Early morning Aug. 1, 2011" "Nagaoka City Hall" "Hirakata Shrine" "Kaki River Forest of Peace Park" We made these origami cranes. "Students delegated to the Hiroshima Peace Ceremony" We'll offer them to the deceased in Hiroshima. "And then..." "that evening" What is that pretty white flower? It's called a lily. Like your name, Mom? Yes. My father said if Japan weren't at war he wanted to go to New Zealand and climb this tall snowy mountain called Mt. Cook and hold these flowers in his hands. That's why he named me Liliko. He said wars take away people's dreams. Mom... Yes? The night of the fireworks is the night of my play. I'm so happy. That you came back. Are you still afraid? Yes. Fireworks are light and sound. Just like war. So you won't go see them again this year? No. A picture-card storyteller stays home when she's alone. Then Mom... Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. Hana... And simultaneously there was a live broadcast in Nagaoka of the Phoenix fireworks in Ishinomaki. You're very young, Mayor. My dance steps? No, Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor... The main event's coming up. The U.S.-Japan launching of fireworks on Dec. 8 in Pearl Harbor. Yes. I was unnerved when I heard about it. I'm prepared. Prepared. Even if we can't this year, I'm a Nagaoka statesman. I'll fulfill my duties. You have to dream to realize it. You really are young. My dance steps, right? "There's Still Time Until a War" - Mr. Katayama... - Tonight's the night. You'll be watching, right? Thanks. No, thank you. Do you feel lonely? The gap remains empty. I lack imagination, huh? Mr. Katayama, you're wonderful. Hana Motoki... You appeared out of nowhere and practiced hard for the play. I'm sure your prayers will get through to people. "Liliko and Hana's Scene" To the healthy brave children of the future like ourselves. Can you run to Kaki River? - Yeah! - Then run. How about you? Granny! Bomb shelters are dangerous! You'll burn to death! We can't help you! Let's get out! Hana! Dad! To the river! To Kaki River! It's time to perform the play we practiced so hard. Don't forget the war. By not forgetting, let's make peace. I worry about when people like us who know the war are gone. But it's reassuring to know that our memories of war are relayed to the children like this. "Ai Shichiri, 87, the model for Liliko Motoki's character" Kaki River was surrounded by wild red flames. Dad, watch your step. Hana! Hana! Senseless... How senseless... My father was gone before I knew it. He always used to have his arms crossed. I tried to give milk to Hana. It was the only thing a mother could do for her daughter. I definitely felt it. She sucked once, twice... She drank milk from my breast. Soon it was morning. I realized I was no longer hearing the airplanes. I climbed out of the river and looked around. Where there used to be a town it was now the sky as far as I could see. I crossed Chosei Bridge. Someone looked at Hana and said, "Disgusting." The sunshine was so strong so I held Hana to my chest to give her some shade. I've never wanted a parasol more than I did then. Dr. Shima of Kusama clinic examined Hana and said... Poor girl. He then... wrapped a bandage around Hana. When I saw how white the bandage was... for the first time... in my empty heart... I felt regret. When I cremated Hana on a metal sheet her ashes fit on a handkerchief. I was stumbling along holding her ashes when I ran into my husband. My husband... had dried a diaper Hana had wet on... and was carrying it with him. Time passed and I lost my husband and I've aged. But the grief I felt then has never disappeared from my heart. Still... You all can see me, right? But they couldn't see us from the airplanes. If they could, there wouldn't have been a war. But we humans have the power to see no matter how far away. This is a story about a girl who was alive for only a year and a half. Her name was Hana. What did Hana see? - Her mother's breasts. - Her hands. - Her mother's smile. - Her eyes. What did she feel? - Her mother's scent. - Her warmth. - Her mother's flavor. - Her breath. Then what did Hana see? Mom! In their future... I hope the war ends. Is there still time until a war? Is there still time until a war? Is there still time until a war? Is there still time until a war? Is there still time until a war? Flowers! "Hana"! Flowers! Fireworks! Fireworks! Fireworks! Yes! Flowers... Flowers! Flowers... There were wars. There were earthquakes. Many people died. Many people's grief lingered on. Sorrow permeated people's hometowns and anguish seeped into the rivers. But hometowns revive and rivers are still flowing. That's hope and people's courage. We felt the pain and learned from these people about their experiences engraved in their hearts. That's why we'll pass them on the others, candidly and with prayers of hope. Fireworks are so pretty because the night is dark. After the fireworks, the night is lit with light from people's hearts. "Seiji Kase, 89, the model for Seijiro Nose's character" Fireworks! They bloom slowly and smoothly. Beautiful! God must be telling us that this amount of light is all we need. Because when nights are too bright, they break our souls. Don't forget. We care about you. Don't forget. You are right next to us. I'm right next to you. Casting blossoms to the sky. Casting blossoms to the sky. Let's cast blossoms to the sky together. Let's cast blossoms to the sky. Goodbye! Goodbye! Uncle! Auntie! Bo! Goodbye! Here they are... The Phoenix fireworks. If the A-bomb was dropped on Niigata I wonder if we'd be sitting here watching fireworks. Maybe we wouldn't be here. - A-bomb? - On Niigata? No... We'd be here. With the fireworks of Nagaoka, with everybody. When we young people discuss trivia, we also need the right reason. Right reason? Wishes and prayers. You draw fireworks like bombs. You think so? Because you hurry. But fireworks disappear so quickly. Just close your eyes and draw slowly. How can I? You can draw the fireworks' wishes and prayers. Right, Mr. Nose? Yes. These fireworks bloom slowly and disappear slowly and smoothly. Slowly and smoothly... They become flowers in these skies. These fireworks today are exceptionally amazing. The fireworks of Nagaoka have matured beautifully. And this is the 90cm shell. Our flowers of prayer that bloom in these skies. Thank you. Mom, can you see me? Yes, I can see you very clearly. Hana... Spirits... Rest in peace. Hana! Good morning. You stayed. I hadn't said goodbye to you. Would we have met if there was no war? My grandparents said they've been through a war and can endure this disaster. They can rebuild Minami Soma too. To repay the kindness people showed us. Sure. And me too. I was too embarrassed to say I was trying hard but one day I'll go home. And I'll work hard to revive my hometown. Then I'll go back too to the past. You mean, to the future. "There's Still Time Until a War" What. I wanted to experience a heartbreak. You're weird. I know. Thank you. I'm sorry. Goodbye. We'll always be together. Always. I've decided to go to your hometown. I'm going there to see you but I don't know yet if I will. Let me say hello first. Please don't speak to me until I do. Please leave me alone until I'm ready. But I'm happy. June 11, from Reiko Endo. To Kenichi Katayama. The only letter I received from Reiko. "Wakako Inoue" Thanks. Here's mine. We're weird, exchanging name cards when we're saying goodbye. You think so? You're leaving without seeing Mr. Katayama? It's too sad to say goodbye the second time. If he and I had a child... If we did, she'd be 18. I just realized. For you. Lunch my mom made. What will you eat then? And the man you share it with... We'll work together again but we'll have our own separate lunches. - Boiled vegetables? - Of course. Okay then. Take care. - Wakako... - Yes? I want you to have these. How did you know? I was admiring them. I guessed. This is great. The fireworks last night really were beautiful. I'm glad. I think I was able to get closer. There's still time... I'm going. Goodbye. Who's in this gap? Mom. You can tell? I can sense her. I'm not lonely. Okay. Are you? When I feel lonely I close my eyes like this. Reiko... A tall unicycle. A tall, tall unicycle. Hana's unicycle. Hana's unicycle. "Hana" Grass transforms into flowers. Bye! ISHINOMAKI WELCOMES THE PHOENIX Kenichi... It feels like I was finally able to meet you. You and I... There are so many things we have to do over. That day too, from such a beautiful sky the fake Fat Man came flying down. Going straight back to Amakusa? I'm returning to Nagasaki. And I've decided to become a mother. I feel brave. Of course, my baby will need a father first. But first, I'll go to the disaster areas of east Japan. For research? Nagaoka, Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Bikini Atoll and Fukushima. The connection between Japan's towns and me... The U.S., the world, yesterday, today, and tomorrow... I want to think about everything that connects into my life. You have to grow so that your life can grow too. Miss Reiko Endo, take care. I will. You too. Mr. Akiyoshi Muraoka... Yes? Be friendly to others. Yes, ma'am. It is now winter and today on Dec. 8, 2011 Two 90cm shells were cast in the sky over Shinano River. The first one was launched in memory of the approximately 1,500 victims of the Nagaoka air raid. The second one was launched in memory of the approximately 2,400 American victims of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 8. Nothing like this had ever been done before. Nagaoka took this opportunity to send a delegate of students to Hawaii. They attended the 70th anniversary memorial service in Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor today is a place that symbolizes a new harmony and bond between the U.S. and Japan. That was what The Niigata Nippo reported. So one day in the skies over Pearl Harbor flowers of prayer will surely, most certainly bloom.
