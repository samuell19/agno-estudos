We do not have a residence permit. And what do you want me to do? You can take him to a clinic. Don't you think you have many requirements?

It disappeared. Nerd. Children are very expensive. Nice. It will be here in a month. Promise me you won't put them in a coffin. I promise. Here is the solution to all our problems, I prefer to call it: "Compulsory labor" The people who come here illegally will belong to the state. They become the property of the state, and that puts them to work, where there are needs. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea I totally agree. But finally you know... When you start applying this idea, you will find that the consequences are harsh... I don't think... - A minute sir, what do you mean by that? People will say that this is a new kind of business. So, and what is the problem with slavery? Below our feet
