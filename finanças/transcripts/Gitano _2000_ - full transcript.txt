We've been waiting two years for you to sort things out. We're all with you, cousin. It's the law. We have to wipe the slate clean. Cousin, say something. You, shut up. Let me breathe! Two years... Two years. No one wants blood but there was one death. Andrés! Andrés! - Go home. - Watch me dance. Later, Tiznaito. Now go. There is a death and it is the law: an eye for an eye. All is said. Right, Andrés? Where you go? Don't piss off. Want me to pay to get in? It's not true! Andrés Heredia! Good god, what a talent. Don't stay there, come in. Can I offer you something... besides the view? An ice whiskey. Lots of ice cubes? As you wish. Three ice cubes. Choni, don't hog Andrés, I have a lot to tell him. It's for me. You're so beautiful! A healthy life... Two years of healthy living. I'm happy to see you. You are so beautiful and you sing so well. To your freedom. You see, you arrive and I leave. You leave? After the Generalife concert, I go to Madrid. And yours? Mine? My family? Fed up with others, gypsies and all their stories. And Uncle Manuel? What does he say, your father? That instead of two girls, he has whores. Like mothers, like daughters... You saw it? Not for a long time. Don't worry about that anymore. Do like me. Replay and forget. I would like, but I can not. Peque! How's it going tonight? Not many people, but good people. And your brother-in-law Andrés. Thank you so much. Oh, good people... Let's see... Cousin! What happiness. What talent. In my arms. I'm very happy to see you. Where are you going, my little cat? More and more good, the Lola. Did you hear her? An angel. Let's have a drink. Choni, general tour. Let's celebrate my cousin's return! The greatest artist in the world. Tonight, we're having a blast. Like the good old times. Damn, Peque. How you have changed. I barely recognize you. Deals. I'm installed. Shit, Peque. Romero, you and I were the band Candela. To what's left of Candela! Your family wants to settle accounts with the Juncos. With you too, right? - You're a Junco. - Listen. The Juncos shot your cousin, but that guy was crazy. It was none of his business that Lucia left with a "gadjo"! I don't care. I don't want to know anything. We are gypsies. It depends for what. Not to kill each other for old stories. Take. Don't piss off. Take it, don't be stupid. After prison, we are stiff. So that you miss nothing. Do you remember, cousin? Damn, they screwed up the band. We could be there. Me and you... And Romero too. ''Candela'' Even the name sounded good. And that music we were making! We were just going to release our record. ''Bohemia''. Do you remember the single? ''Listen, whatever your country, what the street taught me is that you have to get it. Listen, whatever your country, what the street taught me is that you have to get it'' Where are you going, cousin? My house. It's true... you have a house. Or you had one. And a woman. A woman... and a house. Me, I have a wife who doesn't love me and a house they won't let me in. Here we go, Peque. Go on... But for 1000 duros I'd play more in front of "gadjos"! Now I'm my own boss. Look what you used music for! Damn his mother! Fuck them! ''In my sleep, I dream of the kiss of the one who loves me. In this loneliness I can no longer live... I'll take you to the hotel. Give the keys, you'll kill yourself. Fuck them all! But what a surprise, Andrés Heredia in the street... You didn't escape, did you? Don't move, asshole. You have nothing? Shit then. Note, everything is negotiable, right? It wouldn't be the first time. Who told you to move? I put you in the hole for nothing, I'll put you back there when I want! Now you're gonna be nice and you won't touch anything. Including? Is that clear, asshole? We're breaking up this time. And don't look at me like that. Not my fault they bang your wife. Some are born with a cuckold face. Do you have a cigarette? Do you know where to sleep? Yes. I have what it takes. What? I please you? Want my picture? - Good morning cousin. - How are you? Isn't that what we do best? - Can we come in? - Yes, Uncle Manuel is waiting for you. It's what? Gift from your cousin Peque. In case you need it. Or me... Jose, what do you think of that? The same as you, uncle. Hello, Uncle Manuel. I'm glad to see you outside. For the best or for the worst. I know you are happy. They did the Chino trick to you. - And I wore the hat. - Couldn't be less discreet. And I bet Lucia knew about it. - I don't know. - I know it. I know my daughters. They look like their mothers. The Spanish, modern. The French, whore. I don't know which is worse. Women are annoying. When they don't do anything, they cry, or they make honest men miserable. Listen to me, Andrés. If Lucia was just my daughter, I would have killed her. But since she was your wife, I couldn't get involved, even though she dishonoured us all. I can't forgive her for betraying a gypsy for a "gadjo". Even if that drug story were true, there was nothing to leave you. Before, you didn't like anything related to drugs. No less than today. Look at your cousins ​​arms. Not a sting. As for the "gadjos"... if they like the horse, we can provide the saddle... But they are one thing, and we are another. You have to manage well. But I have clean hands. Let's go. How is it going? How beautiful you are, my treasure. Here, son. Look at him. The joy of my old age. For him, I want a clean and honourable future, art. Sit down. We are gypsies, and our laws are our laws. Your cousin slept with her. It was the only solution. These are the laws. It was a big mistake. I'm not saying the opposite. If I could, I would have apologized to Isidoro. But some things don't happen. We can always discuss. What do you want me to say? We have enough balls to assume even a dead man, with or without reason. It's still time. May be... Maybe not. Until the first shot, we can always talk. And, you know Andrés... It's funny. You're the culprit and it's you that I would have preferred to see out of all this. If we don't work it out, don't come with them. How? Don't insult me. Excuse me. I know you are real gypsy. I didn't mean to offend you. It will be tomorrow night. You leave me little time for an arrangement. You said it yourself. Until the first shot, we can talk. Farewell, son. I knew that woman would be your downfall. It had to be the French... She's a gypsy, mom. His father is a gypsy. She, she is not like her sister. This one, yes. You're going to get her, huh? I don't know, mom. She has always known how to trick men. She grabbed you there, and she's got you there. Don't worry. We'll see. Leave here. Redo your life. - You have the music. - No. That's over. - For all time. - You are young. Mom, I can't leave. If I leave, I won't be a gypsy anymore. You will always be a gypsy, wherever you go. The son of a bitch! But he got out of jail... What are you doing here? Aunt, I came to see you and Rosa. She's there. Since when? Since the death of my son... Since the death of my son. Such a waste. My poor son. You are as beautiful as my son. You too should be dead! Don't say that. Only Peque fared well. He walks around as if nothing had happened, and my son, buried... He was handsome, Romero. He looked like me, didn't he? Very black hair. You were about to release the record. They fucked us well. That is true. He had you well, this "gadjo". And my son... Why did you get involved in this? I didn't get involved. It was a set up. I don't understand any of this. But anyway, you went to jail and my son is gone. My daughter in law. Look at her. Not even as a whore they want her. Give me something. - Give... - I have to go. Don't leave without giving me something... It's for tonight. If no one prevents it. You are all ready to go. That's right, Andrés. Let the old people persist with that... But you! This is my last debt to the family. - It's the law. - The law? But you can go back to the hole or get knocked down! It is written. Or it is as if it were. Kiss my ass... Leave me. You have the clock which is a century behind. What's up with Peque? Nothing. I don't need a gypsy to support me. And he, what does he say? He has nothing to say. What are you looking at? Cousin... Drop it all, and let's get out of Granada. To take advantage of it, cousin. To enjoy. And this one, fuck her. The important thing is me and you. Like the good old times. Romero is missing. I can't take it anymore. I don't support it anymore. He is your husband. I'm tired of you too. So what, cousin? You are crazy, Peque. You, the farm! All the same! Stopped! Stopped! Stopped! Don't get involved! It's none of your business, don't get involved! You all piss me off! What? Watch out up there tonight. Will you be with yours? In the end, you are a Junco. My kingdom... is not of this world! We have to go. lsidoro, it's been two years. Two years, Manuel. You are well supported. You also. I would like to talk. I'm listening to you. Listen, Isodoro. We, the Juncos, we regret what happened. One thinks that... - Stop! - It's over! Everyone quiet. I said it's over. Shit! We applied the law, we are in order. We're even. What are you doing here? You are looking for me, aren't you? Looking for you? I don't know yet. You don't know? Did Manfredi send you too? No, I came alone. To do what? I came to see you. How funny. In two years, you haven't come once. Not a visit, not a letter. I can tell you nothing. You wouldn't understand. I understand everything too well. He will get you stuck. Then you can't get away with it. - In addition, they... - They? I'm still your wife. No, you are not anymore. I'm your female. You still want me. You always wanted me. You have to help me. Won't you help me? Andrés, it's Lucia. Andrés, can you hear me? Lucia? Where are you? Andrés Heredia? I'm Pepa Molina. You remember me? Glad to see me, right, asshole? So what? Do you want to play with me? Can we play it for real, you and me? You don't like? You who are a real guy, a real gypsy... Mr Manfredi is very far away, in another galaxy. Right, Pablito? Yesterday there was mayhem, right? And you were there, right? But it's not big deal. If he dies, someone will take the blame. And that will be one less gypsy in Granada. One day there could be one less policeman. Alright fuck it's ok... We have time. We're going to make you party until you confess for last night. It seems that you want to be your sister-in-law? Or has it already been done? See how easy it is... It wouldn't be the first time. Let's go. And don't bring her back, okay? So you, nothing. Nothing at all, right? I swear it on my freedom. I swear on my children. Too bad for our mouth. You will kill yourself at work! One again? Why are you bringing me more? We interrogate half of Sacromonte, nobody knows anything. Nobody saw anything. In the hospital there is a gypsy with a hole like this, and no one saw anything. Must have balls. And you who are you? Andrés Heredia. Another Heredia... Let me guess. You haven't seen anything either. Not true? Damn his mother! He has a history. Listen, Chino, don't bother me. Here, even an infant has a history. Ortega! Kick everyone out! Hello Master. Andrés, how good you look. Are you back from vacation? Yes. Two years. Thanks to you. Don't be cheeky. I have something for you. From now on, I want you to lack nothing. Sit down. Are you taking anything? No nothing. Thanks. On the other hand, it would be good if you forgot Monsieur Manfredi. And my wife too? Yes. If it is possible, also forget the Frenchwoman. You really don't want anything? A coffee, a toast? That's why you always look so good. Luckily, I'm not gaining weight. It must be nervous. There are 2 bricks and you owe us 20. Whose? To the Candela group. To me, to Peque and to Romero. Peque doesn't claim anything, he manages. As for Romero... Romero is dead. There remains his mother and his widow, and me. Look, sweetie, that's all there is. Your Defense has incurred costs. Expenses? What costs? You let me down. André darling inflates them to me! Is it Manfredi who says my wife isn't worth more? Listen. Take the money, and forget about Manfredi and the Frenchwoman. - I have a good memory. - Remember the jail. Manfredi can get you two years back together, just for your pretty little face. Or more. Am I scaring him that much? He wants to prevent you from doing something stupid. Listen to me fucking dyke. You owe me 20 plaques, Manfredi 2 years of freedom, and for my wife, it's my business. My little Andrew... You can put them where... It's true, I'm really happy. You know it's true. How happy I am. I love you, shit. Kiss Me. Since you left, Lola wants more from me. I love her, Andrés. I'm sorry. Don't be fucking sorry. Here we are, me and you like in the good old days... There are still a few things to settle. Be careful. Manfredi is mighty, and he has everything. And you... you have nothing. It's you and me like the good old days. It's not important. I also have a pair of balls, and my knife. Drop it. He won, period. Forget him. I'm tired of hearing that word. It's life, which has balls! It's like we've all got the wrong person. Listen to me, Peque. Don't you dare knock on my house at 6:00 in the morning. Leave me alone, do you hear? Get that in your head. Damn, your sister-in-law... As I brought him this... It's not my birthday today. Leave me alone. Do you know how much it cost me? I don't care. Me, you will buy me more. I love you, Lola. Kiss my ass. Damn, Peque... I'm tired of him pissing me off. Tired of the gypsies and tired of you. If you only knew how I understand Lucia. This motherfucker, if he could die... Lucia came to see me. I know. She told me. Do you see her? Occasionally. After all, she's my sister. I want to see her. You're stupid, Andrés. You don't understand anything. Damn it... You never understand anything. Your ID please. Where are you going? I'm going to see Mr. Manfredi. - You have an appointment? - It seems. Heredia, it's not true! You look good. How is it going? I finish this and I'm yours. I thought you were in Granada, to enjoy the family. This idiot won't enter the studio. What next. We had agreed to release his title. You said it... We were engaged. Don't stay there. Enter a minute. Andrés! I'm glad to see you. So, how are you? What talent. That's great. You have talent. - How was it? - Tremendous. So much the better. I will return. See you after? OK, see you later. Look for a better plan, 1.3. 4, come on. That's it. First, 3. Yes, you are in. No close-up of the one in white. She changed managers, bitch. Second. Get me a close-up. What a bad luck, this story. But you see, that's life. Can I do something for you? Do you need a job? Silver? You have quite the nerve, Manfredi. For me things are clear. And if I can be of any use to you, let me know. You let us down. And I took it for two years. Everything can be compensated, Heredia. When we want it, we always end up getting better. And how are we dealing with Lucia? Listen Heredia, let's be clear. For Lucia... It's his life and it's his problem. - Did she tell you? - I know it. As for your group, sorry, you were unlucky. - You put me in jail. - You're wrong. It was cruel fate that put you in prison. It was to get rid of me. Come on, Heredia. You didn't understand anything, but whatever. I compensate you and you disappear from my life. And that of Lucia? It doesn't concern you anymore. You haven't realized yet? She came to see me. Don't say stupid things. When? A few days ago. In Granada. I'll give you some advice. One, and only once. Don't come near Lucia or me again. I too will give you some advice. Sleep with one eye open. Or better yet, don't sleep a blind eye. These clothes, you'll see... Curro says I'm good for Hollywood! - Me, at a dressmaker? - You accompany me! - My princess... - Curro! Welcome, my beauties. Come in, come in my children. What a beautiful gypsy you offered yourself. So big. So elegant. And if... My God, a real scandal! Are you studying or working, honey? Forget it, Andrés is not on the same side. My God, what a waste! At last... Please go to the living room, while I take care of this moorish beauty? I prepared a few things for you... Next to you, the Schiffer will become nothing at all! Hello, Andrés. Did Manfredi send you? That son of a bitch? Son of a bitch if you want, but you left with him. What did you expect? We were going to succeed. We never had the same idea of ​​success. Why did you come? I'm afraid. You already told me last time. Before you shoot. Manfredi is dangerous. He bought them all. You also. You know nothing. You told him I was coming, right? Didn't he send you? Him? So... why did you come to us? I told you. I always have you under my skin. Like her. Don't get her involved in this. When I saw you sleeping I looked at myself in the mirror and I realized there was nothing we could do about it. We don't choose the outcome. She chooses you. Don't pity me. With a mink coat, or this gold bracelet... I forget everything. You always wanted this. Now it's up to me. It's mine. And I paid for it. But what I pay or not is up to me. They will kill you. Who? Manfredi, Chino and Pepa Molina. I came to warn you. I've already been killed. It was you who killed me. I don't want you killed again. I have to go. Do you know she's in love with you? Longer than me. Or do you think I never loved you? I will leave the house, going to Madrid. Basically, it is that of Peque. He bought it shortly after Candela ended. Peque always wanted to live in that area, in this Arab atmosphere. I told you not to leave Granada, dirty gypsy. Not to annoy people. And what are you looking at? I'll put the gun in your piggy bank! We get off, shit. I don't want to see you in Madrid anymore. Next time, I'll blow your head off. Queer! Here we go, fuck. One day you will fuck me. Gypsy motherfucker. You're crazy, Chino. Go show yourself, too! Give me a cigarette... please. Does it hurt you very much? What a pleasure to see you. If the little one gives what he's worth, on Saturday at the Alhambra, he'll be a hit. Find me a seat near the kid. To the greatest Junco of all time! To his talent! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you! I'm sorry, Uncle Manuel. It was my business. The joy of my old age... Swear to me that when you find out who did this, you will tell me. Swear it to me. I swear to you. Remember your promise. It's okay, right? It's good for us? Lola, you can come up. - Yes, Luisa. - You have a visitor... Thanks Luisa. Close the door. What's the matter with you? You owe me 20 plaques and explanations. Are you kidding, Andrés? Don't make me call the police. To begin with, those of the motorcycle. What are you talking about? Look, you really should go see Manfredi. I didn't have to take care of you anymore, and that's it! I'm only an intermediary! Hold him to account, or your wife. Or his... 20 plates. Give them to me! Give them to me! Open. Open it or I'll shove it for you. Slut. What is Manfredi doing at the Alhambra concert? He has his own artists. - He has a case tonight. - But still? Someone will be at 11 p.m. at the Alhambra Hotel. Who? The. There, you have the name and the number of the room. Does this ring a bell? You got yourself into a hell of a mess. You're done, son of a bitch! You are finished! - What are you doing here? - I owe you money. What is this story? The one that Pepa Molina kept for us. Account. Not worth it. Count, I tell you. Looks like you have a date. Yes. I have an appointment. A key, a car, a briefcase and an appointment. Want to know more? We'll go together, cousin. You've always been in on it, huh? You fucked me. When things go wrong, everyone takes their marbles back. Candela was a good group. Manfredi never believed in us. What was left for me? In the "gadjo-land"... To rot there. Romero got screwed. And you... What did you get out of it? Jail and a woman who... You have Lola. I paid. - No not yet. - What? Let's go. What are you doing here? Come over there. Still? Dirty gypsy, you're going to toast. Get out before I puncture your skin. I warned you, son of a bitch. Go away! Don't do it again, damn it. I warned you, faggot. I warned you! Chino... It's full of gypsies with balls! You also? Did you switch sides? Show how brave you are. Chino, damn it! Clear. Holy shit... Get out! Go on! And take that! File! You screwed up my life. You screwed up my life! Uncle Manuel, it's Andrés. And the chinos? He's not coming. Congratulations. You did well. What could I do? I can't sing like my sister. You in prison and me without a radish... The money is there. What did you want? Pull me to jail once a month? With the guard holding the candle? What a beautiful family scene. What a touching story, this poor abandoned woman... Why not tell him everything? I told you the truth. The truth, the truth... How many truths are there? Yours, mine, hers... Won't you shut up? Lucia, tell him who's in charge here. From the beginning. I don't know what you would have given as a musician. But as a failure, you are a mine. Give me the gun. The pistol... I told you not to involve him in this. Things have changed. Now he's wet, and he's in the way. The pistol... Sure. I forgot. Your pussy. Your holy cat. You still have it there. Don't get him involved in this. We're gonna do things my way. I don't want... I protected you by leaving you in prison. From everyone and from myself. But you got out. Now I'm free, I can choose. Come with me. Daughter of a bitch. Kill me. Kill me if you got balls. Kill me if you can, son of a bitch. I still make you hard? That's it, huh? You always want to fuck me! You have no balls! You never had any, even to kill me...
