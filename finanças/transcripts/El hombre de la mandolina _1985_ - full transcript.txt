with ROSITA QUINTANA, in her stellar return to national cinema in THE MAN WITH THE MANDOLIN The star performance of: MARÍA SORTE # The student band has arrived # of the Uni. Queretana # listen to the mandolins # and lean out the window # I am the faithful bachelor # singing to his sweet love # loving you more than yesterday # but less than tomorrow # I don't want to be a lawyer # I don't even want to be an accountant # I want to be your boyfriend # even if I never… even if I never become a doctor # Because of a kiss I gave you, they wanted to flunk me # since then, I promised # that I would kiss you again # Look at who plays the violin # and the one who strikes the tambourine # one studies Latin # and the other will be an engineer # I don't want to be a lawyer # I don't even want to be an accountant # I want to be your boyfriend # even if I never… even if I never become a doctor # In geometry class # I copied you an equation # and in anatomy class # I stole your heart # While we play the mandolins # Why do you close your windows? # The student band is leaving, # of the Uni. Queretana, # I don't want to be a lawyer # I don't even want to be an accountant # I want to be your boyfriend # even if I never… even if I never become a doctor Carlos! Let's go! Wait for me a little bit. Come on! Get in there, by the shops. - Tobias… - What? I need some vacations. I'm very tired. Where are you going to invite me this time? - Take the left. - Invite you? Nowhere! It's from you that I want to rest the most. Do you remember what you said to me at the station, once? Stop there. Good afternoon, sir. - Let's go. - To Juriquilla. After this, you won't be able to live without me. Or you without me. Come in. What will you drink? Who is the man with the mandolin? Jardiel! Are you going to get up, or not?! Jardiel! Stop wasting time! You're running late! Yes, Mom. - Hurry up, it's getting late! - Yes, I'm coming. What's wrong? Well… I'm dropping out of college. What? Are you crazy? - Why? - I need the job. The money is not enough in the house. Let's go, we'll talk about it. You know I don't trust long courtships. It's just… Well… Héctor hopes that his father will give him money to start a business. A store, Mom. Why doesn't he give in advance his share of the ranch? Because Don Emiliano wants Héctor to finish a degree. But he's sure he'll get his share as soon as he knows we're getting married. Then, force him to marry. With weaknesses, you will gain nothing. How, Mom? How am I going to force him? Don't you have imagination? What are you listening to? Are you interested? Chipá again? Isn't there anything else? There are bananas, too. - Did you pay for the expenses? - Goodnight! - Goodnight. - Oh! Finally, the sir arrives! I had a lot of work at the hardware store. We did the inventory. - Thank you. - Your welcome. Hey, daddy… I need some pants. I had two, but one already broke. Here. Thanks, Dad! Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Good night, Mom. Of course… Since it's about Jardiel… But if any of us asked for something… - I'd give it to you. - "I'd give it to you." This damned life. The salary is low, but it'll help us. My poor old man can't afford the expense of so many children. I think I'll have to do the same too. How so? Because in my house the situation is the same. Also… No… No, I'm telling you no! - No? - When we get married. No! # People talk and gossip # that they see her walking the streets # without knowing who her father was # Dolores, the one who sings # I cherished her with good love # but the slander shamed her # and she couldn't clean the dirt # that evil threw at her # If you go to… # Calatayud # If you go to Calatayud # ask for Dolores # that a poem killed her with shame and disappointments # Say this, as I'm telling you. # The son of Dolores # Olé! Carlos! Hello! Hey, it's your last gig at the student house. Yes, I dropped out of college. I wanted to ask you a favor. - What's that? - At your job… Is there work for me? Are you also going to drop out of school? I think so. I have no choice. - Well, I'll let you know later. - Carlos! - Congratulations! - Thank you very much. You know Ana, right? This is my girlfriend, Eréndira. Eréndira, do you know Jardiel? - Nice to meet you. - Hello. Congratulations! - Good morning. - Morning! Hey, you… How elegant! You like them? What horrible rag is that? They're pants, Mom. In the latest fashion. You look… Decency doesn't allow me to tell you what you look like! I do like them, little brother! What happens is that these are already old. But the pants are great! Your father will know! He will know what you are spending his money on! Don't worry, Mom. I already dropped out of college! Tomorrow I'll be working, and soon I'll be able to support myself! What did you do? Moron! And don't you dare go outside wearing those pants! This will be your desk, Mr. Dorantes. - Carlos… - Yes, sir? - Introduce him to the other employees. - Correct. Very well. Thank you! Sabal, I want to introduce you to a new colleague, Jardiel. Hello! He's a bit of a joker. Ignore him. Your suit is dirty. Look, Ronal, I want to introduce you to a new partner, Jardiel. - How are you? Nice to meet you! - Nice to meet you! Do you remember Eréndira? You met her at the party. Welcome. Rocío! What's up? Where are you going? - To my house. - Come in, I'll take you there. - No. - Rocío! Wait for me! Wait for me! - Are you in a big hurry? - No. But it's not right for us to go like this. What's wrong with it? Let's park the van! Go ahead! Please, let's go! Besides, you're beautiful today. Yes? Please! Come along! What the problem? Come along! I'll bring you back… - Well, but for a little while, okay? - Of course! Come along! And what are you doing here at this hour? I felt sick. I fainted. And because of a faint you left the business alone? Very bad, Fina, I feel… - I left Rocío in charge. - You know that girl is very clumsy. You look like an old man. As delicate as your son Jardiel. - What do you have against Jardiel? - Nothing. Fine. - I'm going back to work, then. - You're not going anywhere. You're going to bed. And when you get better, you'll go back to work. Mr. Dorantes, have you finished calculating the taxes? Yes, sir. Very well. Very well, Eréndira… - Come, please. I'll dictate to you. - Yes, sir. Nice pants, Mr. Dorantes! Where did you buy them? - In Deviliex. - Ah… Deviliex. Thanks for the tip. That's the fashion clothing store, isn't it? What fine hands you have, Mr. Dorantes! Do you play the piano? I forgot! The mandolin, right? No wonder… I'm a law student. My father is Don Humberto Dorantes, the owner of "La Fortuna"… The hardware store. And I'm working as a litigator in the best law firm in Querétaro. They say I have a future there. Do you remember the fat lady joke? - What fat lady? - The one we told in college, man. Oh! The one who fell into a well… See you later, guys. - See you, Hector. - See you later, Hector. - One more beer, and a tequila. - Thank you! - Thank you, Jardiel. - Listen… Eréndira, she's your friend, right? Just your friend… Yes, I like her. Don't you? - She is cute, I like her. - Yes. - Hey… - What? I tell you one thing… You have… You have a very special look. Hasn't anyone said it before? Don't fuck around Carlos! Carlos! I'm your friend! Do you understand? Understand?! Aren't you going to work? Last night I was waiting for you until one in the morning. - At what time did you get here? - Very late. They paid you your salary, right? Where is the money? - That's all? And the rest? - I also have my expenses, Mom. Wow, you finally got up, lazy! Lulú… Here, so you can buy your books, or a dress. Thanks, brother. Carlos… I wanted to apologize… For last night. It's okay. But don't let it happen again. - Got that? - Friends? As always. Friends as always. Sometimes Mom and Dad talk about how I have to marry someone who has as much money as they do. What do you think? You know I'm their only daughter… But I think I have the right to be happy. They say that I should beware of those who seek me out of interest. Fabiola… Tell me something… Do you think I would love you just for your money? I don't think so. No, please don't… - No… No. - Look at me. Yes… - Will you really marry me? - Of course! Yes! - Will you really marry me? - Yes… # "Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honor to present to you" # "one of the greatest artists of Mexico," # "one of the most popular Mexican artists…" # "The man with a thousand voices, Ferrusquilla!" Rocío? Rocío? Yes, Mom? - Aren't you going to eat? - No, I'm not hungry. See you tomorrow, Mom. # "My dear Don Emilio. On these cold nights" # "of hard winter wind, I want to bathe in the river" # "and swim like a charal." # "Maestro Furiel, all in all, didn't ask him for anything," # "and Don Emilio gifted him a tropical path" # "but it was already paved." # "What Eva Garza asked for, she asked for it by singing and singing," # "and Don Emilio gifted her a new set of throats!" # "To Chucho Martínez Gil, author of "Dos arbolitos", # "Don Emilio offered him a taco of nopalitos." - Good afternoon, everyone! - Good afternoon. Come on, guys! Don't leave! Today is my birthday. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Thanks. Thanks. - Thank you. My mom went on a trip. - Congratulations. - I invite you to my house. I'm alone. - Right now? I prefer to leave… Come on, man! We need to have fun! We won't let Eréndira down, right? You will have to excuse me, it's just that… My wife is going to give birth. Well, then, congratulations to both of you! Congratulations, old man! - Come in, guys! - Go ahead! - Sit down. - Thank you. Is your mom really out? Of course! She went to San Juan de los Lagos to fulfill a promise. - How so? - I've behaved… - There are soft drinks. - And alcohol? I don't know, let me check. Carlos, will you come with me to buy some bottles and some soft drinks? - Are you coming? - No, man. Are you going to leave her alone? We'll be right back. Don't be late, okay? Hey, bring ice! - It's my mom. - You look alike. Yes… Especially in personality. Sit down. You're very shy, aren't you? Do you have a girlfriend? Yes… So many freckles! They're not freckles. - They're moles. - Yes? Let's see this side. You have so many. - So does my mother. - Yes? Just like you? Will you let me count them? You're so shy! Did you get angry? I'm just getting to know you… How shy! - Sorry, sir! Sorry! - Moron! Shut up, you crazy jerk! Getting lazy again! You haven't even taken off your clothes! - Come on! Get up, go to work! - I'm not going. Another lazy one in the house? No, get up! I'm telling you to get up! Fina! Why don't you leave the boy alone? The boy? Useless! You and him, two good-for-nothings in this house! What's going on, Jardiel? Dad… You are going to suffer a lot. Jardiel… Jardiel! - Hey, what happened to your hair? - Nothing. I just felt like changing its color. I was fed up. Would you give me a cigarette, Mr. Dorantes? Oh, sorry, no, thank you very much. I just remembered, that brand makes your hair change color. Excuse me. Idiot! Jardiel! Get inside. You're finally acting out, huh? Do you think that with a mother like you, I could love women? Ungrateful! You'd better have died, before staining the name of my family! - Take off your clothes! - Fina, you can't do this. - What?! - Don't you dare! Don't dare? Rocío, bring a sheet. From now on, that sheet will be your only clothing. - No! - Get off, kid! Help me, Andrés! Don't hit him! No! Jardiel! Jardiel! These damned pants. The briefs too. The sheet! Give me the sheet! Cover up! You will never leave this house again. You won't be able to tarnish my family's name! You will stay there until you rot! I love you very much, brother. Go find your father. He's capable of committing any stupidity. Carlos… I need you… Dad! Dad, are you really sick? Rocío, lock up Jardiel. With a padlock. You, go for Doctor Ibarra. You heard her Fina… Fina… I loved you, so… I loved you too… Before. Fina… Life… Life was going to be wonderful. - Jardiel… - Jardiel! Humberto! # My life is a bazaar, with toys of love, # my life is a bazaar where pain nests. # My love toy has always been you, woman, # and playing with love I adored you with fervor. # I have played to love, I have played to kiss, # my games are over, my grief began. # My pain is to love you… Life was going to be wonderful. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. May your will be done, Lord, on earth as it is in heaven. Jardiel, are you there? Do you hear me? - Yes. - Dad has died. We are mourning him. I'm leaving before they notice I came to see you. Please, Gentlemen, don't stop! Hector… Hector. What now? I'm not giving them to you until you listen to me. Well, go ahead. It's just that… I'm pregnant. - And how do you know? - Because this month I haven't… Well, we'll figure something out, right? We have time. Yes! Getting married! Yes, of course… Okay. We'll see. Are you are worried? Yes. That little brother of yours… Jardiel… Has a very bad reputation. I don't like him. Jardiel… But nobody has seen him for a while. He doesn't leave the house. Yes, but he is there. And everyone knows it. Jardiel! Come, brother! What's up, Lulú? What's up? I'm leaving this house! Where? Oh, brother! With a boy, of course. But you're just a kid. Not anymore. Not for a long time. Why don't you get married? Because he is not rich. And the last name Dorantes only marries to money. I won't forget you, brother. We're going to live in Morelia. He got a very good job there. He is a good boy. Don't worry. Why don't you run away? We'll wait for you there. He is not ashamed of you. Me neither, you know that. Thanks. I wish all women were like you. Jardiel, I no longer need these. I hope they help you. One of her friends must know who she was hanging out with. No, Mom. I already asked everyone and nobody knows anything. Jardiel… Jardiel must know something, Mom. That guy? Well, it's just… She was the only one talking to him. Call him! Jardiel! Jardiel! Come, my mom wants a word. Do you know who she ran off with or where your sister went? Speak! Where did she go? To glory. I told you that crazy man wouldn't know anything. To glory! To glory! To glory! To glory! Let's go! That damned crazy Jardiel is to blame. Héctor told me that he had a reputation that he didn't like. And you don't know where he went… Yeah, he went to Canada and he's not coming back. Then we'll have to figure something out. One of the Naredo brothers likes you a lot. And they have a lot of money. Mom, that's not possible. - Why? - You just don't understand… I'm going to have a child. What? I told you to force it, but not like this! Stupid! You! It's your fault, damn you! Take it easy! Get out, wretch! Mom! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, what do you want? This is Jardiel Dorantes' house, right? - Yes, but right now he's not here. - Oh, it's just… Look… We play together in the same student club and we are co-workers. But since he stopped going… He had to leave Querétaro and… I'm sorry. I can't give you any more information. Goodbye. Hey, but-- Jardiel! Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! Come in, Andrés. - A little cognac? - Thank you. This is the good one, huh? Sit down, please. A cigar? Well, well… I think it's time we spoke up. - Your family is broke, isn't it? - Momentarily. Next year I'll become a lawyer, and… That is a productive profession. Okay, yes. But you know that… To climb in that career you need relationships, - intelligence, ability. - I have them. And I also have an illustrious surname. Oh, that's right, of course. On the other hand, I don't have an illustrious surname, but… I do have money, Which is what you lack of. On the other hand, your surname is, well, a bit washed out. You know, with your little brother and… Your sister, by the way, is she back yet? Pretend she doesn't exist. And my brother Jardiel… - Well, he doesn't exist either… - Yes, I know. He is confined, that is the word. He is confined to his house. But what if one day he decides to go out and people start gossiping? I think it's better if we talk later, in the end, there's more time than life. You are smart, young man. We'll talk about marriage another time. Cheers? Cheers. It's 250 pesos, Mom. - No, right? - No. But for Jardiel… - Did you sell the business? - Yes, but there was little money left. In any case, this house remains for any emergency, which I hope is not necessary. No. It won't be necessary. # For all the joy # that you brought into my life # For your bright smile # that makes me happy # For the fresh tenderness # that I feel in your soul # I call you, my angel # that I sing in my love # For the childish surprise # looking at yourself # you will be the mirror # where I am reflected # Because you are fresh fruit # that was born from my branch # I call you, my little angel # I sing to you, my child # I would like, with my love, # to trust your whole being # and cover it with stars # my boy # my angel… How beautiful you are, Mom. I love you very much. Go away! You're free! To those people who walk in the darkness of the night, an intense light appeared unto them. To those who lived in the dark country of death, the light approached them. The shoes that made the earth rumble, the blood-stained cloaks will be burned. The fire will devour them. Go and pour on the ground the seven wraths of God! The fire will atone for our sins. Andrés! Andrés! Rocío! Rocío! The house is on fire! Help me put out the fire! The darkness is reserved for him. A fire that men did not light, devours him and consumes him. You are crazy, brother. Mom! It will be called angel of fire. It will be called justice. Free man, will be his name. Francisco of the fire. Oh, God! - I'm leaving on Sunday. Join me? - If I can, I will. Well… What happened, Andrés? Everything is ready, the day after tomorrow. - I'll talk to you on the phone, to confirm. - You better hurry. They stripped me clean on the cockfights again and I'm in great need. - We are going to be very rich, Tobias. - We will be… And after this little business, you won't be able to live without me. What did you say? That I will not be able to live without you? Or you without me. On my bed… At night, I searched for the beloved of my soul. I looked for it and I did not find it. I'll get up later. I will tour the city. Through streets and squares, I will look for the beloved of my soul. I looked… And I didn't find it. The sentinels found me. What's wrong? I was speaking. Speaking in the only language I have left. I came to see if you need anything. I want to run away from this cave. I'm going to help you leave. Really, Andrés? Really, yes. You can go and be happy away from here. Very far. Thanks, Andrés! Thank you! On my bed… At night, I looked for the beloved of my soul. Let's see, my love… Let's see… How beautiful this child will be! - You're hungry, huh? You're… - Francisco! - This child is ready. - Come, my love. Come here, baby. What's up, my love? What's going on? - And who opened the door for you? - Andrés. - I just wanted to touch the boy. - No! You will never touch my son. Never! Go away! Take it easy. Calm down, because with the bile, the milk can harm the child. What name will you give him? He will be called… Francisco. - Your name will be Francisco. - Handsome! I baptize you, Francisco. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Now, now, little one… My God, what does he have? Now, my love… Now, now, my life. - Mom! - Coming! - I just don't know what to do. - Give him to me. Give him to me! He could not sleep all night. That's why we're going to Doctor Ibarra. Let's go! Jardiel. Jardiel! - What? - The time has come. Put on your clothes. Get dressed, I tell you! Hurry up! Wait here. - What is this? - Money for you to move. - No. - Take it! You're going to need it. Andrés… I leave you here, brother. I don't want them to see us together. Leave as soon as you can. - Have you seen that guy? - Must be a bum. Or worse. Let's go! Yes? Tobias? Yes, It's Andrés. Done… It's all settled. Just as we discussed before. Yes. Yes, of course. # I married a toupee # He had lice, I took them off # with salt water, tequila with lime # body of a grape, pigeon, pigeon, pigeon. # Pedro Infante is already dead, he crashed in a plane # Maria Luisa wept for him. Four candles were lit. # 1, 2, 3, 4, down 24th Street # An old woman killed a cat with the toe of her shoe # The shoe broke and the old lady got scared # Even the chili died down and whispered in bed # Open up, pomegranate, if you are red # Open up, membrillo, if you are yellow # Open up, lemon, if you have a heart The light displaced the shadows. The light penetrated to the last of the corners… And the man came out, melting into it. Owner of his freedom. - What's up, brother-in-law? - What's good? What's up, scoundrel? Hey, have you seen a guy come in, about 20 years old, with a sparse beard… - Skinny and in a plaid shirt? - No. I haven't seen anyone like that. - If he comes, let me know? - Sure. - Look where he buys the ticket to. - Sure, I'll tell you, Tobi. Hey, have you looked for him at the bus terminal? - No. I'm going there. Then I come back. - See you. Strange, the lock was half-open. Jardiel! Jardiel! - What happened, Mom? - Jardiel is not here. They forced the lock on the wardrobe. Some of the money was stolen. But who, Mom? Who could it have been? - Jardiel? - Of course Jardiel! That wretch! But how did he get out of the house? With Lulú's keys. Bastard! Where's Andrés? In the office, or at the university. Listen! Wake up! - Is something wrong? - No, no. - Is there really nothing wrong? - No. Thanks. - A ticket to Morelia. - One way? Yes, please. 35 pesos. - Thank you. - I remind you that there's a transfer - in Celaya and Acámbaro. - Thank you. - When does it leave? - In half an hour. The 873. Is Tobi there? Tell him that his friend leaves for Morelia on the 8:30 train. Thanks. At last! Here he comes. Thank God you're here! Your brother Jardiel stole the money! He ran away! - What? How could he? - You have to look for him! Fast! You have to find him! Come… Come, so you can see what he did. The 873, please. Is Tobi there? It's urgent, tell him that his friend who was going to Morelia didn't take the train. That he decided to stay in Querétaro. Thanks. Jardiel! Hey, when did you come back? I never left my house. You know I went looking for you once, right? Yes… Yes, I know. Carlos… Remember that I am your best friend. Look… You are the best person I know, but… Jardiel! Why? Jardiel! The Dorantes family thanks everyone who expressed condolences for the death of our son, Jardiel, after a long and painful illness. Who is the man with the mandolin? The man with the mandolin… He's my brother. The man to whom I owe everything I have… And everything I am. # In the morning I left for work and I understood # that everything in this life was just love # A smile, a flower, a hope, an illusion # Everything reminds us that there is also love # Long live love! # Long live love! # In the morning, at night, in the rain and in the sun # Everything reminds us that there is also love # Warmth and light, love and peace delivering for others # You don't just have to see the bad things around # Your fault is not enjoying yourself and not having anyone to talk to # If one day you give your heart, you will find love # Long live love! # Long live love! # In the morning, at night, in the rain and in the sun # Everything reminds us that there is also love # Long live love! # Long live love! # In the morning, at night, in the rain and in the sun # Everything reminds us that there is also love # Long live love! # Long live love! # In the morning, at night, in the rain and in the sun # Everything reminds us that there is also love Transcription: JoeBlack.
