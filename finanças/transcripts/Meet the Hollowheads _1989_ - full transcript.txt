(circus music) (whistle blowing) - Operator, Operator? - [Operator] Operator, how may I help you? - Yes, thank you, Operator, I'd like tube 6-7-6-0-6, please. - [Billy] That's my dad! Hi, I'm Billy Hollowhead, and this is about that terrible shift when my father brought his boss home for dinner. Of course, I had problems of my own that shift. But then, we all did. (rock music) - [Operator] You are speaking to she. - Hello, Miriam, uh, listen, dear, I know how you hate it when I bring unexpected guests home for dinner, but-- - [Miriam] What? - Yeah, yes. Yes, dear, dinner. But, but you'll never guess who. My new boss, Miriam, this will be our chance to reach out and grab that brass tube. Opportunity is knocking here, I feel it, my promotion is just around the bend! - [Miriam] Oh, but this always happens, I-- - [Henry] Operator? - [Miriam] Hello? - [Henry] Operator? - [Miriam] Henry?

Oh, honey, I know he's your new boss and we've gotta make a good impression, but, but, but, the house is a mess, and I have no idea what to fix. Hmm, I'll have to get the children to help. I know, I want this promotion just as badly as you do. Yes. Yes, it'll be just fine, dear, you'll see! Yes, dear, I love you too. Alright, bye. Oh, Henry, one of these days, you're gonna drive me right to the edge. I don't even know where to start. (screaming) Billy, what are you doing here? - Same thing I'm always doing at this time, coming home. - Well make some noise next time, you gave me a fright. - Was that Dad? - Yes, and he's got me very worried right now, he's bringing his new boss home for dinner so we can try and get that new promotion, and I am going to need you to be on your very best behavior, Billy. Billy, what happened to your face? - My, my face? - Why, Billy Hollowhead, you have got a black eye. - I do? - Yes, you do! How did it happen? - Well, I don't know. - Billy, who gave it to you? - I don't remember. - Well, I guess we're gonna have to let your father get to the bottom of this. Oh. - Yes, ma'am. - And in the meantime, we can't very well have you meet your father's new boss with a black eye, now can we? - I could go over to Joey's. - Absolutely not, I need you here to help me, and besides, I'm sure your father is gonna want you here for dinner. - Come on, Mom, it's just a black eye, not even a very black black eye, you don't need to use that. - Come here. - Mom, I really don't want this. - Billy. - Mom, I really don't like this. - Shush. - But my eye feels fine now. - [Miriam] Stop being childish. - No. - Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing. (circus music) (dramatic music) (comedic music) (dramatic music) (comedic music) (Billy groaning) - Hey, Mrs. H. - Hi, Joey. - And what's the latest drain in these parts? - Why, we're just taking care of Billy's black eye. Say, Joey, you wouldn't happen to know anything about how he got that, would you? - Well. - I might be able to come up with a nice snack for you both. - Okay, it was Johnny. - You promised, Joey! - He said that Billy's dad was nothing but a spineless pipe polisher, and Billy stood up to him, but not for long. - I see. (creature sucking) - Why'd you have to tell, Joey? - I guess I'm just not as brave as you are. - Now see, Billy, that wasn't so bad, was it? I guess you boys have earned two of my specials. - Great. - Good, two specials, coming right up. (animal squealing) - Here Mom. - Thanks. (squealing) (comedic music) There you go, boys. And doesn't your eye feel better now? - Yeah Mom, thanks. - And try not to make a mess in there. - [Billy] We won't Mom. - Now what am I gonna fix for dinner? - You've got it all, a mom, a room, homemade specials. I get my flesh thinned. Hi there, thanks. Pecoriam. (dreamy music) Smooth move. You got a new splat-spray game. Come on, help me. All right, stand by, for maximum propulsion. - No wait, you've got to start with splatter panels. - Come on, that speed's for babies. - Oh okay, my turn, my turn. (upbeat music) - That's a super fluid idea. (knocking) (comedic music) - Uh oh, Mom's in a cooking mood. - Come on, don't be a squirt. Where is he? - Who? - Spike. - [Billy] Joey. You're gonna get us in trouble. - Spike, come here Spike. - Joey, my mom doesn't want him in here. He's infested. - I know that. Come here, come here Spike. - Billy? - [Billy] Yeah Mom. - I hope you weren't thinking of letting Spike in. - [Billy] We weren't Mom. - Because he needs a good depenetration. - No, no. - Taking Spike back out, right now. Great, I lied to my Mom. I'm in really big trouble. - Be a man. Stand up to her. - [Billy] You really do need a depenetration. Hope they didn't lay any eggs on you. He should feel a little better now. Don't you Spike? Joey, you're gonna make a mess. - Pipe down too bloob. We're just gonna have some fun.

Your father invited his new boss over for dinner, and I need your help. - What is this Mom, a cranium fog? You can't do this to me, Dad said I could go to the party. - What? That is for dinner. Cindy, can't you at least be here when your father gets home? I mean, I need all the help I can get, and I can't even hear myself think with that racket going on. - Go slow Mom, I'll tell Bud to choke it.

Billy! Scum squirts. - Never heard your mother cuss before. - Billy? Could you run an errand for your mom? - Sure, where, when? - Billy, what is this all over your, yuck. Every time you and Joey get together, something bad happens. I want you to change this shirt right now, and get back here immediately, or you will spend some time in the punetration box. - Sure, no problem. I'll get right on it. Well? What next? - [Cindy] Connie? Connie? Pick it up. Connie. Connie! - [Voice On Phone] Hello? - Hi, Missus Gramus, is Connie there? Connie, what took you so long? Guess who asked me to the party. No. No. Oh no, okay I'll tell you. Oliver. Yes, Oliver Digits. Well of course he's a pathetic pipe seed, but he's perfect. He's about the only tuvoid my parents would let me go with. Yeah, it's great. So what are you wearing? You bought the flotation skirt? With what? And your mom went for it? So I can borrow it, right? Oh Connie, we're gonna have so much fun. - Billy, my tubes are stuffed up again, so I want you to take this list to Stationmaster Babbleaxe, and either get them to unblock those lines, or fill this list from what they've got on hand. - Right. - Now, you know that I wouldn't send you to the pumping station unless I absolutely had to, don't you? - Yes, ma'am. - So I want you to promise me that you and Joey will not get into any trouble there. - Okay, I promise. - Now, get going. And don't stop anywhere else, boys. - Don't worry, Mom. - And stay away from the edge. - No problem, Missus H. - [Billy] Whenever Joey said, no problem, I knew we were gonna have one. As we walked to the pumping station, Joey told me about our friend, Seymour Legs. It seems Seymour was playing with his splat-spray game, except he got caught using his baby sister. His parents were gonna put him in the punetration box, for just about ever. So Seymour ran away. Some people say he fell off the edge. - [Joey] You know, I don't believe in the edge. That thing's just one of those stupid things parents make up. - [Billy] But where'd he go, then? - [Joey] I don't know. I heard someone slide off the edge once. - You did? - Yeah. I was out walking once, and I heard these footsteps coming, and then after a few seconds, a scream that went. (screaming) And then nothin'. - You haven't told me this story before. (eerie music) (dramatic orchestral music) (gas blowing) - Okay you rat-reaming tube slime, when I say read, you say, what to. You human fools, I want a volunteer right now. Give me a hero to go. You, reamer, you're up. Take 41-A. - But that's the waste tube sir. - And you are the waste. Now in the tube. - Sir this is my first reaming sir, couldn't I take the 16-D sir? (laughing) - What kind of mama's little tube boys are they sending me these days? Now you get your passive tubes into that pipe, or I will wrap you around the four-way gang valve, is that understood? - Aye sir. - Go, move it, move it. (screaming) - Watch this. - [Boss] Reamers, I want you to make me proud. - Joey. - [Boss] I want you to hit those tubes men, and I want you to ream. Everyone, let's get 'em. (upbeat music) - God, should have been having lunch. - You tubal slime. You let 'em get away. - I was just gonna try and get my mom's order filled. (ominous music) - [Cindy] Hey Mom? - Yes, dear. - [Cindy] Where's the softening jelly? - It's right next to the fem stick dear. Softening jelly? (knocking on door) - Yes? - [Miriam] Cindy, can I come in? - Sure Mom, the door's unlocked. - Cindy, I-- - Yeah Mom. - What did you want with the softening jelly, dear? - What all women want with it, Mother. - Cindy, don't you think you're a little too young to be using softening jelly? - Mom I'm 14, Connie's been using it since she was 12. - And if Connie wanted to jump off the edge, would you, too? Oh dear, you know I have never forbidden you anything, just because I'm your mother, and I said so. We've always discussed these things, haven't we? But there are some things in this life that you have to have a certain maturity to handle. - Come on Mom, you treat my like I'm a child. - Well you are a child. Honey, do you know that I had been married to your father for a long time before I even tried softening jelly? - Well Mom, it's not like that anymore. I mean, I just want to feel nice, like everyone else. - This wouldn't have anything to do with Jeff, would it? - Jeff who? - You know which Jeff I'm talking about. Who are you going to the party with? - Oliver. - Oliver? Oliver Digits? - Uh huh. - Oh, he is such a nice young man. I should have known your father wouldn't give you permission to go with just anyone. Oh well, all right. I guess you can use the softening jelly, but in moderation, darling. Don't start feeling too nice. - Okay, thanks Mom. - They grow up so fast. - Miriam? Honey, we're home. - Delightful domicile, Hollowhead. - Hello dear. - Hello. How's everything going? - I want you to meet the new head of United Umbilical, Martin Crabneck. - Oh, I am so pleased to meet you, Mister Crabneck, and congratulations are in order. - Why thank you, Miriam. - Excuse me. - And permit me to say my dear, that the pleasure is truly all mine.

You've done very well on your salary. - Actually I'm glad you brought that up. I've been meaning to ask you about my salary. - Later, Hollowhead. You need to learn timing. That's funny, for a meter reader, your timing is rotten. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to jump into it, I'll try to work on my timing, you're right. - You don't work on timing Henry, timing, timing is bred in the bone. It's a talent. You've either got it, or you don't. Now, look at me, Hollowhead. I've got it. That's why I'm the regional president of United Umbilical Housing Corporation. And thousands, like you, are not. Timing. - But Mister Crabneck, United Umbilical has been run by a long line of Crabnecks. - That's right, that's why I'm president now, timing. Right place at the right time, but Hollowhead, you've insulted me. I was not merely Umbilical born, don't accuse me of nepotism. I've got executive skills. I've got a take-charge personality. I was born to float to the top. Now, what you're good at Henry, is metering tubes, and that's it.

Oh Billy, you need to go and get cleaned up, honey. And Joey, you're gonna have to run along. We have a guest for dinner. - Okay. Next time. Tube slime. - After a while womb file. - Hi Jeff, I wrote a poem for you. Yeah, you would? Okay, I'll do it for you. Whenever I'm with you, my heart seems to burst, like mainline fluid you're quenching my thirst. Your lips on mine, taste of sweet tubal wine. My body reeking of constant despair, Jeff do you love me, Jeff do you care? Let your essence go, take my hand and let's flow to a place no others would dare, the tube of my dreams, the tube to nowhere. Billy. How long have you been standing there? - Oh Jeff, tube of my dreams, let's flow. - Don't ever repeat that to anyone, okay? - Only Mom. She'd love to know you got into her stuff. - Well I happen to have her permission. - So it doesn't matter if I tell her? - Well I'm gonna tell her you were spying. - I bet if I tell Mom what I saw, you'll never be with like Jeff. - Okay, let's just forget everything. - No, let's not. - Oh you little-- - Mom's gotta hear this story. Oh Jeff, your lips on mine, like a sweet tubal wine. - All right, what do you want from me to keep from opening your big, fat-- - Two nickels nowhere shut. Feed Grandpa. - Jump off the edge. - Make it six turns. - Billy please. - No, that's the deal. No ifs, ands, or butt polish. - All right, I'll do it. But you want to know something? You're gonna wake up one of these days and find that everything that matters to you has shriveled. - Oh, what, your boyfriends? - I think that-- - There's another problem Hollowhead. You are always interrupting. Timing is an essential ingredient to growth. You see it's what's going to make our company grow. You have to know when to flap it, and when to cap it. That's the tale of the tube, in one short squirt. - Hi Dad. - Billy, come over here and meet my new boss, Mister Crabneck. This is my son, Billy. - Well, hello there Billy. (laughing) Well he's a binky little drip off the old glop isn't he? - He was a tube baby, Mister Crabneck. - I'll bet you have trouble with the other kids, right? - Henry, could I have a word with you in the kitchen, dear? - Certainly, dear. Oh excuse me. - Your timing's improving, Hollowhead. I was about to ask where the waste chamber is. - Oh, down the hall, second orifice to the left. (ominous music) - And I'm about to fix dinner. - Oh I know dear, and I'm sorry, but you see he didn't give me any choice, he just invited himself. He came up to me, and he said, Hollowhead, I like knowing more about my employees, and I'm gonna take you up on that dinner invitation at your place after work, and I started to say but, but Mister Crabneck, what dinner invitation, and he just started laughing at me, and he said that he liked the man who could improvise and think on his feet, and make snap judgments, and I mean what could I do? - All right Henry, I understand. It's just that I wasn't prepared. I'm sorry. I'll try to do better. How do you think it's going so far? - I really don't know, dear. I read meters, not men. - Why Henry Hollowhead, you know you are a brilliant man, and a great asset to United Umbilical. Mister Crabneck will see that you're the right man for the job. You just leave the entertaining to me. - Oh Miriam, how lucky can a man be? - Oh about Billy. - Come over here son. Sit down here. Now, your mother tells me you did have a little trouble. - Well it was really nothing. - Son, fighting is always something, now we've talked about fighting before, haven't we? - Yeah. - And do you remember what we said son? - That violence never solved anything. - That's right, and I'm sure Mister Crabneck here would agree that fighting-- - Oh purge, Hollowhead, let me handle this. Come here Billy. Come on. Now I'm gonna show you something my old man taught me before I, before he died. Hey, what's you got on your shirt? Deception, son, you gotta trick the suckers, look. Up here. See how easy that was? Now I'll show you another. - Mister Crabneck, don't you think you're being just a little too--- - Meter it Hollowhead. I'm doing your boy a favor here. Come back here, you yellow-striped pipe blot. (laughing) You'd better teach that boy some manners, Hollowhead. You certainly haven't taught him any self-defense. - Well, I'm afraid that that is not our philosophy, Mister Crabneck. - I should have guessed. Stand up. - Well we try to teach the kids to reason with their peers. - Stand up. - Mister Crabneck, my wife doesn't allow any roughhousing in the front room. - Who's this? - Cindy, come over here and I want you to meet Mister Crabneck. Mister Crabneck is my new boss, at UU. Mister Crabneck this is my daughter, Cindy. - Call me Marty, Cindy. Delighted to make your acquaintance, my dear. - Nice to meet you, Mister Crabneck. - Now, you must call me Marty. All my big girls call me Marty. You're looking very, should I say, succulent. - Cindy don't you think that that dress is just a little too-- - Too enticing? Too alluring? Too suggestive? - Yes. - Not at all. Fathers are the last people to recognize those special womanly feelings, particularly in such a beautiful, fine daughter. - Thank you, Mister-- - Uh uh uh. - Marty. - Marty, good. So are you all dressed up for someone special? - I'm just going to a party with some of my friends. - When the boys get a look at you, they're going to trip over their own tubes. - Mister Crabneck, you are such a kidder. - Cindy, you'd better get going now, you don't want to keep your little friends waiting, do you? - No, I guess not. - Bye Mister Crab, bye Marty. - Get her out of here. - Cindy, I was just gonna come and get you. Billy said you volunteered to feed Grandpa. - Feed Grandpa, but Mom. - Shhh. We don't want Mister Crabneck to know, now do we? You know they would just love to find out we've got Grandpa, and then they would pump him away. - But Mom, I'm in a hurry, I'm gonna be late. Grandpa, I have your dinner, Grandpa. Hi Grandpa. I brought your food for you. (soft orchestral music) Grandpa stop. Stop it. Grandpa stop it. Stop. - Hello Mister Hollowhead. What's humping? - Well I think you mean pumping Oliver, and the UU pledge goes like that. Now come on in here and meet Mister Crabneck. Mister Crabneck is (muffled) of UU. Oliver, this is Mister Crabneck. - Hello sir. Say, did you read the imprint on super-pneumatic suction, in the Tube Times. - Well Oliver, who do you suppose developed that model? - Wow. So do you think we'll be running on bullet tubes soon? - [Henry] Just around the bend, Oliver. - [Oliver] Smooth, Mister H. I'll be you can do it too. It's like I tell Cindy, where there's a will, there's a Hollowhead. - Who is he Henry? - This is Oliver. - No, Hollowhead. Read my lips, who is he? - This is Cindy's date. - Is Cindy ready? - Yes, Cindy, Oliver's here. - Well Hollowhead, she may not have your bad timing, but she's certainly got your bad taste. Well, he's a real case of the squirts. - Hi Oliver. - Hi Cindy. You look really nice. This is for you. - Thank you. Let's flow. - Bye Honey. - Bye Daddy. Bye everyone. - [Miriam] Goodbye Honey. Have a nice time. - Well well well, if this isn't another happy home, tied to United Umbilical. A happy home, two kids. - Oh, three. Three, you haven't met our eldest, Bud. He's our musical genius. - Three? - Three. - Why you're more of a man than I took you for, Henry. Of course when you're married to a woman as enticing, as alluring. - Oh I'm sorry. Did I walk in on some man-talk? - [Henry] He was just talking about you, Miriam. - Oh Mister Crabneck. - Marty, call me Marty, Miriam. - [Henry] Mister Crabneck was just-- - Well, as I was telling Henry here, I would do just about anything to have a woman like you, Miriam. - Oh really, Mister Crabneck. Marty. - Right. - How's that dinner coming dear? - Well if you two will come to the table, I'll go and get Billy. - I hope you're hungry Mister Crabneck. - Hungry, why I'm famished. I could suck a waste tube from here to the edge. - Good. We're all here now, so we can start. - Speaking of soups, would you believe I recorded 14,937 GPM's last shift. Some of those tubes were getting real hot. - I find talking business at the dinner table awfully offensive, Henry. Don't you, Mir-- Miriam? - Well, Marty, sometimes I just don't understand all the talk about PM's, viscosity, all that technical talk like, what makes the tube hot. - You Miriam. (laughing) - GPM's means gallons per minute, dear. Viscosity is a measurement of how quickly a given fluid can pass through a certain size orifice. - That can cause an an eruption, Miriam. - What makes our tubes hot, is the friction caused by the viscous fluid flowing through the walls of the tube. - Hollowhead, I do believe you've embarrassed your wife. - So what happens next Dad? - The heat can cause a rupture pretty soon and you've got fluid spraying everywhere. - Love to. Of course the equation changes, depending upon the length of the tube, but that's not your department, is it Henry? - Oh but it could be. Henry's just a little bit quiet about his talents, Mister Crabneck. - Uh uh uh, it's Marty. - I'm sorry. I'm just not used to calling my husband's bosses by their first names. - Don't think of me as your husband's boss, think of me as a very close friend. - I believe you're the one who's embarrassing my wife, Marty. - That's Mister Crabneck to you. And who gave you permission to unplug your pipe meter, monkey. - Dinner's over, I think it's time to leave. - Seal it screw-top before you're up a purge pipe without a paddle. - Now Henry, I don't that that mister, uh Marty, really means it, I think he's kidding that's all. He's just kidding, you wouldn't want to do anything to lose your job, now would you? - I'm not gonna lose my job, Miriam. I've been with UU for almost 20 years now. I started in the waste department, as a reamer, and spent shift after shift crawling through rust-encrusted pipes. - Henry, please sit down. - Dad? - I think that Marty was just kidding, weren't you Marty? May I serve you, Marty? - Yes, I would love you to serve me, Miriam. Mmm, this looks delicious. Please forgive me, Miriam. I had a bad time at work. You see the demand for tubes, why it's overwhelming. We pump eight billion gallons in every station, and I, I am personally responsible for almost 16 million miles of tubes. What the pipe stick am I talking about? Why you must be bored stiff, listening to us talk shop Miriam. - Why no, I find Henry's work very interesting. - Yes, why I was just telling Miriam what would happen if only one of our pumping stations broke down. - You mean like what happened just a little while ago? - Are you trying to say in that half-formed way of yours that something is wrong with our tubes, young man? - Some of Mom's tubes are blocked. - [Henry] Some of the lines were blocked? - Yeah. Me and Joey had to go to the pumping station and complain to station monster Babbleaxe. - You complained? Why you little bezore. You're too lenient with your children, Henry. Too many privileges, children need discipline. You don't want them winding up as rationalists, do you? - What's wrong with that? People should have the right to think what they want to think. What difference it make? - I'll tell you what difference it makes. United Umbilical was not founded by a bunch of lowlife sludge-sucking, rat-reaming rationalists. And if they were to find out that you lean even slightly in that direction, they'd cut your tubes off so fast, the only thing you could do is crawl into a two-line and flush yourself off the edge. I should know. My ex-wife was, was a-- - A rationalist? - Didn't you know that when you married her? - No, I married her because she was a sumptuous piece of throbbing flesh. - What's that mean Dad? - Never mind, son. - And because she looked good at company parties. - What happened? - It was at one of those very same parties, that I found the leak in her mainline. She was a rationalist, and I mean a real card-carrying member. She as much as announced it right there in front of the entire upper management of United Umbilical. But of course I had no choice. - You divorced her? - Divorce is such an ugly word, I prefer, dispensed. - You must have loved her deeply. - Often. But I'm a company man, and you know what kind of business this is, Miriam. It's a cruel business. A cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel business. You never know what you're up against. That's why I have to maintain control at UU. If you're going anyplace in our business Henry, you have to be ramrod tough, ramrod. Nothing less will do. Now you Henry, you lack the substance, the real meat, your ramrod helper. Without me you're nothing. - I don't like your tone, Mister Crabneck. - Miriam, I plan on nothing less, than blazing a trail right to the top of United Umbilical. - What about Henry? - Henry? - [Miriam] Henry. - A promotion in UU? - Yes, me me. I think I'm long overdue for a promotion. - And after all, he is featured in the current issue of Tube Times. - He was voted number one meter man in his section, three times in a row. - Three times. - Yes damn it, everybody knows I'm the best meter man in the business. - Then why would anyone want to promote you? - Yes, of course. That's right. If you're really good at your job, why would anyone promote you away from it? - Now you're getting it, Henry. The fact is, that our industry isn't for boys. It's a cruel business. You're a smart woman, Miriam. You understand that it's a cruel, cruel, cruel business. Cruel, - Dad! Cruel business. So unless your husband can offer something more than his sterling qualities. - Maybe I am too good for my job. (laughing) - Mister Crabneck, are you suggesting that if I? That Henry will? - Call me Marty, Miriam. - I could screw up the whole works. (dramatic orchestral music) - It will grow on you. - Dad! - [Marty] Let me have it. Come on Miriam, you know you want it. - No I don't. - No means yes. - Promote me. Billy? Hey, where'd everybody go? Hey, what's going on in-- Mister Crabneck, what are you doing? - Cap it, before I stick you sideways through an eight-inch. Now, come on Miriam, let me have it. - You want it Marty, all right you get it. - That's it, Hollowhead. No raise for you. - Well I'm too good for your UU. You just say the word, Miriam, and this guy's crap. (muffled) - Yeah, get him Dad! - Take this. And this. - Do you remember what we talked about over dinner, Henry? Now I'm going to show you just how cruel this business really is. - Please stop, Marty please. I'll do anything. I'll do what you want. - Stop him Mom, stop him. Yuck. - Did I kill him, Miriam? Is he dead? - No. - He's not dead? - No, I mean, you didn't kill him. I did, I mean, I think I did. - Oh Billy, don't. - Yep, he's dead all right. (screaming) - What do we do now Henry? - I don't know, I've never done this before. - That's it. Starting tomorrow you're reaming pipes outside on number nine. - I have to sit down. Miriam, I don't believe this. My boss is lying there on our kitchen floor, dead. Do you know what this means? It means I don't get my promotion, he has to okay it. - Your promotion? Henry, what about your career? We just committed murder. If they find out, they'll throw us off the edge. - There really is an edge? - What about regeneration? - Oh Henry, that only works when they're still alive. - Oh, hey wait a minute, how do we know he's not still alive? We didn't check. - If you want to go back in there and check, you go right ahead. - I will. - No son, this is a job for the man of the house. (growling) - Mister Crabneck, I mean, Marty. - Oh purge. - Well, that surely should have done it. - I'm gonna find out. He's still alive! - How could he be? - Well he is, we can still save him. - Save him? Are you out of your mind? He's sleaze, he tried to kill us. - Yeah Dad, he's muck. - Billy. - We can't let him die. - We can't let him live. - I suppose you're right. - Somebody's coming! - Quick. - Wait! We can't leave him here. - We can hide him in the kitchen. - Good idea, come on, give me a hand. (light orchestral music) - Mom? Dad? What's humpin'? - He's totally liquified. - What do you mean? - [Miriam] How do you know? - Bud, what's going on here? - I just got back from the party, Dad. I'm afraid my friend here may have had a little too much to drink. - Oh Bud. I really can't believe this. - Oh yeah, home. I had to come home, Dad. I couldn't stand that party. - [Henry] Why not, Bud? - The new songs, the guys were right, they didn't work, they hated them. - Oh Bud, honey, I'm so sorry. - Miriam? Bud? - I'm so hungry. - Bud, sit down before you fall down. Can't you hear me Bud, what's wrong with you? - Don't burst the pipe. - Get some cold water Miriam. - What are we going to do? - Dad, can you forget about, you know? - Don't just stand there, do as I say, get some cold water. (doorbell ringing) - No, Miriam, you get the door. - [Miriam] I'm getting the water. - Miriam, the door, now. - The water, the door. - Another critic. - Missus Hollowhead? - Yes, may I help you? Cindy! - We thought it best that we escort your daughter home. - What happened? Are you all right? - Well, she was attending a party in which the kids found out a way how to pirate into an extremely restricted feed line, and well, your daughter obviously has gone through some experimentation tonight. - Ma'am if we could just bring your daughter into the house. - Uh, no. - Pardon me? - Well, I mean, my house is in such a state, couldn't you just leave her? - Is everything okay in here? - Well, I uh, well, I guess if you don't mind the mess. Do um, make yourself at home. Henry? (laughing) The police are here. What are we going to do? - Let me handle this. Hello officers. Good shift. - Good shift. - What seems to be the trouble? - Well Mister Hollowhead, we had to bring your daughter home. She and a bunch of her friends apparently tapped into a highly restricted vapor feed source. - How could that be possible? - The shame of it is, no matter what we do, these kids, they're gonna find a way to get in. We notified UU about the illegal tap, and we also notified them about the fact that there was minors under the influence. - Influence? - Your daughter and a friend have apparently been mixing vapors. - [Miriam] Bless you, you. - Thank you. Not now. Not now, it was earlier. (laughing) - I tell you sir, we found well over two pounds of softening jelly on her. - Two pounds? - Miriam? Miriam, dear. - And also there's some physical evidence that would lead us to believe that your daughter-- - She was-- - She had been-- - Severely compromised. - My little angel foam, tell Daddy, do you know who did this to you? - Oh yes, I'll always remember. I mean, I don't remember all of them. - Was Oliver a part of this? - Oliver? - [Henry] Oliver. - Oh Oliver, no no, he didn't. - Oliver couldn't, are we talking about one Oliver Digits? 17, brown hair, brown eyes, useless presence. - That's right. - He overdosed. He's all hopped up on the butt polish. When are kids gonna learn to just say no to butt polish? - Oh but fortunately, I had these two big strong, policemen there to save me. - Cindy, Cindy honey, don't you think it's time that you were in bed? Cindy? (sobbing) Thank you officers, I think I can handle this now. - Excuse me sir, could you please explain to me why you and your wife are covered with some sort of tubal discharge? - Well, we had a ruptured valve, in a splat-spray game. - Let's just try that again. - Well, no. No. - Our son, Billy, he has one of those new games, you know, splat-spray. - But don't forget the ruptured valve, dear. - [Cop] May we see where the rupture occurred? - No! - It's just that it's a mess. Besides, Henry works for United Umbilical as an authorized serviceman. Don't you dear? - Yes, that's right, I do, yes. - Well, could I see your identification, sir? - Oh sure. - Okay, you might want to be a little more careful in the future there, Mister Hollowhead. - Oh yes, thank you I will, I will be. - And, this thing about your daughter, remember, the wellspring of control lies within the father, then it runs out. - Cindy, honey. Cindy, Cindy sweetie, what are you doing down there? (laughing) - Thank you very very much for your time. You've been so kind, you must have children of your own. - No, I usually have to buy 'em. Hey. - [Miriam] Good shift. - Good shift. - Your daughter, she'll be fine, but for safety's sake, you'll probably want to have her drained. - Drained? - Wow, Bud, you ought to hear this. Bud? (screaming) - Let me out of here! - Hey hey hey, hold it right there. What seems to be the problem? (growling in the kitchen) - I got ya! (laughing) - When are you kids gonna learn? - They want to live life on the edge. They're going to. - Oh, why did he ever come over for dinner? - This has been the worst shift of my life. - Ah it hasn't been that bad, Mom. - Yes it has. Jeff didn't even show up at the party, and I had to feed Grandpa. - Mom, Dad, that's it. - [Cindy] Hi Marty. - It's about time you two got up. I'm so upset with both of you. To think that my children would ever make me ashamed of them. - Mom, just because Cindy got caught with all that softening jelly is no reason to take it out on me. - Bud, you spaced out son of a pipe polisher. - Cindy. - Stop it you two. I don't want to hear another word from either one of you. Or do you want us to start following children's home rules, like other parents. - Hi Dad. - Well now, there's my boy. - He's not your boy. I mean, he's your little man now. It is so nice to have everything back to normal. Billy, I fixed your favorite. - [Cindy] Brackish spring again, Mother? - It's still breathing. - Breathing? That shows how little you know. That means it's not properly aged. - When I was your age Bud, we were more interested in basic survival techniques. - Yes Henry, but things change. After all, you don't have to push everything through a tube by hand anymore. It's a different world. - That's true dear, now it just sucks by itself. Say, whose turn is it to feed Grandpa? We're all together, and we're a family, so let's all feed Grandpa together, huh? Mealtime, Grandpa. I hope your hungry, Mister Crabneck. - [Billy] Dad, there's one thing I don't understand. - Yes. - You know how you said it was bad to fight? - Yes I did. - Did we do a bad thing to Mister Crabneck? - No, not at all son. Do you remember what else we talked about? - It's the blind man who follows the trail in the dark. - That's right son. (uplifting orchestral music) Good shift, Grandpa. - And good shift to you, Marty. - [Billy] As it turned out, it wasn't a pipe dream after all. Dad finally got his promotion. He told me later, it was all a matter of timing. The right place, at the right time. As for me, I just go with the flow.
