- Am I scared? - Yes. - Terrified. - Of what? Of myself, of disappearing. Have you not observed how I have given death much thought? Since I first observed you, apart from all the others, a young boy half in a dream. What do you suppose I saw in that half-dream? Youth and beauty. And, the inglorious but - sa... Shit. Shit. - No. No. Something about a dull life. See, you're paraphrasing, Jay. I really need you to get this right. - It's hard. I'm trying. - It's in the writing. Is it? I don't get it, to be honest. Okay. Just use my words. - Speak slowly, Bette Davis. - Yes. Yeah, it took her... Took her 20 years to learn how to speak slowly. Yes. Do you want another drink? What time is it? Callisto hates when I day-drink. I have no earthly idea. Fuck it, his train doesn't arrive 'til 9:20. - In New London? - Yes. It's the transgender capital of the world. - What? - Yeah! They're all engineers at Electric Boat. They build nuclear subs. - Vodka? - Yes. Wow! - Really? - Yeah, really. Actually, I just made all of that up. But it sounds about right, right? - You're smart. - No. Smarter than the guys I know. Well... Except Callisto. He's crazy smart. - Yeah? - Yeah. He knows as much as you, probably more. Well, he should read my play, then. He already did! I gave it to him last week. - I... - He read it immediately. Callisto's a mad reader, been trying to get me to read Goodbye, Gatsby. The Great Gatsby? Right. Shit. It's the saddest sentence in the English language, - the final line of that book. - That book is fucking endless. And? - What? - My play. He liked it! I think. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. Yeah. He did have a few thoughts, though. \ "Thoughts.\" He said he'd tell you about them when you two met. There's an icebreaker. No, dude, he won't be rude or anything. He's just direct, very direct. He says it like it is. No bullshit. If he doesn't like someone or something, you'll know about it immediately. There's something to look forward to. What time does Charlotte get here? Um, her flight gets in at 11:30. - My God! - You know, Hadrian was not an easy character to write, by the way. Does Charlotte ever talk about Beyond Riches? No, she hates it. She was such a bitch on that show. Well, bitches are her bailiwick. I'm sorry, what did Callisto say about my play? You know, he's just a snob about everything. Upper East side, Greek. - You know the type. - Yes, I do, actually. My first boyfriend at Columbia was Greek, from Queens. Same church, different pew. Is it kosher to ask Charlotte about Down the Lusitania? Why not? Stars hate talking about their old movies! Okay, you should never trust what you see on Instagram, particularly from old movie stars. I don't! But you gotta admit, it's pretty accurate, especially the comments. That's what I focus on, what people say. That's why I'm not on Instagram. - You should be. - Why? Because! You're a playwright. That's how you get known. No! I write to please myself, not other people. I want to get known by writing good plays that give voice to my generation. You know, it's my material that deserves attention, not me. Fine. Do it your way. I am acting with Charlotte Christian. Yay! Life goals. How old is she now, anyway? Just a little bit older than me. What? No. - Really? - Yes, really. I am amazed. 57 is not that old, my friend. - Still. - Still what? Still, she looks better than most of the people I know that age! Of course, I don't really know anyone that age, except my parents, who party like chorus boys on a cruise ship contract and still look fucking great. Thank you, good genes and coconut water. All of my friends are still young. How nice for you! How very, very nice for you! What? No, you don't count! I really don't care anymore. You act younger than anyone I know. - No one can keep up with you! - Thank you. Charlotte takes great pictures. Movie stars have to. Her and Callisto are super blessed like that. They cannot take a bad picture. Me? No. I hate having my picture taken. Smart. I was kind of a sick Charlotte Christian fan for a hot second there in the '90s. Me and my friends used to act out Down the Lusitania in our friend Toby's garage. I played the Charlotte Christian role, of course, Lady Amelia Herbert. I had a dress and everything that I stole from my Aunt Cheryl's closet. Auntie Cher was a colonial Williamsburg reenactor. She played the lead town whore, according to her. But I never saw any other whores when we went there on class trips. She always rolled out the red carpet for us, really hammed it up. She died. Cancer. Smoking related, but was all kept very hush-hush in colonial Williamsburg. Jesus. In the '90s, I watched my boyfriend choke on his own blood and die. Another drink? Why not? Yes. Vodka? Yes. - Was he sick a long time? - Yeah, like two years. I'm so sorry. God, it was a long time ago. I don't know much about AIDS. I know. - No one my age does. - That's a tragedy. Except Callisto. He knows everything about it. He refused to do anything anal until I got tested and saw Long Time Companion. Wait, wait a minute. What... what about condoms? - Doesn't believe in 'em. - Really? Yeah, he's one of those radical anti-condom people. I didn't realize there was such red-hot controversy swirling around condom usage! So Greek, right? I guess. Of course, he knows about my past, the shit I did before him. For example? I was such a slut. Before or after colonial Williamsburg? Before, during, and after! Weren't you, like, 14? She bloomed early. She bloomed real early. In fact, my first boyfriend was head apprentice to Colonial Williamsburg's ye olde blacksmith, who just so happened to be the hottest daddy in town. Mr. Luther, fucking hot. I'm sure they fucked around after hours behind my back, - in the shop! - That sounds illegal. Shit. Colonial Williamsburg was basically a brothel with fudge. Him and Mr. Luther still fuck around when he's in New York on reenactment business. - You mean \ "Mr. Luther and he\"? - Yeah, sorry. You know, they don't teach grammar anymore. They don't? But is it even necessary? We're all autocorrected now, anyway. Um, I'm still a fan. They don't teach as much about AIDS, either. Yeah. What did they teach? No, I mean, seriously! Aren't some things still mandatory, like history, or health? Nope. We just Googled. Wow. Well, The internet didn't exist during the AIDS crisis, so if you wanted to survive, you had to fight for every shred of information you could get your bloody hands on. We survived an avalanche, and each other is all we had. Yes. Preach AIDS realness. Tell Callisto when he gets here. I suspect he already knows, based on your current reporting. Probably, he's a fucking genius. Hey, you... You've made some interesting observations here in the script. \"It takes a whole life to learn how to live\"? How sad. That's all Callisto, not me. Well, this one just says \ "Alexandria\"? That is me. Virginia, right? Egypt. That makes so much more sense. Yeah, it would. - Don't be mad! - I'm not... I'm not mad! Why would I be mad? It's just... It's cool. Where are you putting me and Callisto? Upstairs, in the bridal suite. Nice! My glutes hurt like fuck. Too many squats. Callisto gives heavenly massages! - So I've heard. - From who? From heaven's highest seraphim and cherubim, who ceaseth not to proclaim his wondrous deeds and virtues! Shut up! You saw his ad online. - He's a masseur? - Mr. Magic hands. Very popular with the silver sneaker gays. Even has a few celebrity clients who shall go unnamed. Clive Davis. But his parents are making him get his bachelor's degree, at The New School. Whoop-whoop! Don't tell him I told you, he's embarrassed as fuck by it. - By The New School? - No, no. - No, by his parents. - I know, mum's the word. Okay. This bitch is gonna go upstairs, take a nap, and get pretty for his man. Have fun. Serabin and pheraphim! Virginia. Jesus H. Christ. Morning, guys! Just checking in with an update. Running Waters' mum has been texting me. Julie Beth said that Running won't be released from prison today, which is totally messed up, I know. She thinks two legal aid attorneys might be coming from Sioux Falls today to meet with the Big Bluff tribal elders to discuss bail options. And still, the mainstream media refuses to take a stand against the oil companies and to cover this tragedy unfolding on ancestral land here. Well, there. I had to leave the Big Bluff yesterday for the East Coast. I'm now at a writer friend's summer house in paradise for a week or so for some much-needed physical and metaphysical rest. And doing a reading of his new play, The Extinction of Fireflies. Important work. Can't say anything about it right now, but basically it's about every-fucking-thing that's wrong in the world right now! Brilliant! Right. I'll check back in with you guys as soon as I hear more from Running's mum, my darlings. And remember: we've got to stay positive. Can't go to the negative. They go low, we go high. We are the Big Bluff! Vegan forever. Mwah! Namaste. Peace. - Perfection. - Jesus Christ! - Scared the shit out to me. - My God, I'm so sorry. - Don't do that again. - I was watching you live! Don't ever sneak up on me! I'm old and I smoke. I could go at any moment. Well, you look great. I look like fucking tornado wreckage. That's crazy! You look so good. Who are you? - I'm Jay. - Jay what? Jay Mulch, as in the groundcover. Charlotte. Christian, as in the religion. Smoke? Hello, Charlotte. I am so pumped to meet you. - When I was a kid... - Yes! James told me all about you. You're reading Antinous. Yes! With you! Yay! You're not at all how I imagined Antinous. - No? - Not at all. I imagined him younger. - Much younger. - Well, he was 14. Antinous broke the heart of the most powerful man in the ancient world: a Roman fucking emperor. Antinous was pure, pious, and chaste. Right! He was the most beautiful boy who had ever lived. You'll make it work, I guess. - Make coffee. - I'm on it. You are exactly how I imagined the mother, Plotina. Mother figure, darling. And it's \ "Plo-tin-a.\" - \"Plo-tin-a.\" Say it! - \"Plo-tin-a.\" \ "Plo-tin-a.\" Very good. Plotina, yeah. Exactly how I imagined the mother figure, Plotina. Exactly how you imagined? - Totes. - Like dead. I'm ashes. He's turned me into fucking dust! I spend the whole play in a fucking funeral urn. Use the organic coffee if he has any. Yeah, um, um, I'll look. Yeah. How is that urn thing gonna work, anyway? Who knows? I think James makes it up as he goes along... What the flying fuck? I'm turning into a reptile, darling. I'm shedding my skin. Do you have any body lotion anywhere? Yeah. Um... I have so many questions for James. - So does Callisto. - Great name. - Greek. - From Greece? Greenpoint. Brooklyn forever! - You two are a couple? - Yep. A year ago, Pride. We met on the Atlantis float. My first agent/husband/sponge was a Greek. - Greeks are the best! - In the sack, sure. - Girl! - But be careful, mate. What do you mean? Let's just say my Greek worm stopped working after he met me. Callisto's not like that. He's getting his bachelor's degree. - In what? - Business Administration. Christ, another one? Motherfuckers! So, how do you see... your character? - A total bitch. - Yes. Yes! Well, that's why James asked me up here, to read the thing. And because I'm the only name he knows who maybe might be able to get this thing produced. Yeah. Has he ever had a play produced? Once. But it was a failure, basically. He paid for most of it. Back when he had the money. It's hard. It's hard when you want to do something that requires a real gift, you know? Especially at his age. Time runs out. But he does work hard, I'll give him that. Except now it's do-or-die time. - Right. I... - Do my back. I've been wondering how he's doing it, to be honest. I mean, financially. I haven't known him that long. Two years? We met before Callisto. We had Will was still around then. My William. - So cool, right? - Christ. He's a fucking Christmas angel, dressed up as a toucan! Wow. How he put up with James, no one knows. Callisto had some really interesting critiques about the play, I thought. At least it's better than his last one. You know, the one about, um the pen pal murder. Yeah. What was that one called? The Pen Pal Murder. Yeah. Callisto thought that the writing felt stiff. Well, he's right. You know, James controls his characters way too much. You've got to give us room. You've got free us up. Well, at least let us speak for ourselves. Callisto's a great writer. - He did a thing last year. - A play? Yes, but without any scenes or dialogues or anything. Just, like, a long outline. He said he'd find the rest in rehearsal. Well, that's always fun! It's about a lesbian couple, both Jewish, from Poland, who fought in the American Indian Wars as men. I love it! It's based on some book he read. I need to read that outline! I'll get it for you! As soon as Sleeping Booty wakes up. She's up! - What? - Nothing! Morning, dearest heart! We were just talking about you. - I heard you. - You did? How'd you sleep, Mrs. Roosevelt? I was up all night texting Running Waters' mum. Right, Julie Beth. - Good morning. - Good morning. - We need organic coffee. - And cigarettes. We're running out. How about wine? - Do we need wine? - Always! Well, we've got to stock up, boys! Aye-aye, captain! We sail at dawn. I... I read your script. - Finally. - I know. Some good stuff in there. I'd like to maybe hear Callisto's notes, though. Wait. Now they're \ "notes\"? Me and Charlotte, we were discussing the play. \ "Charlotte and I.\" We went over this, honey. Well, that's why we're doing this this weekend, right? To read and to give you feedback. Daddy's gonna need coffee for this. Maybe Callisto can help make your play better, stronger. Of course he could. And then we could all smoke cigarettes and drink rosé while we watch him levitate in the backyard. - James! - I'm kidding, honey. - Well, he is a writer. - Since when? I told Charlotte about Callisto's new piece about the lesbian couple, both Jewish, from Poland, who fought in the American Indian Wars as men. Wait, the foof and the what and the... wait, what? I can't wait to read it. - It's just an outline! - Well, it sounds very detailed. There are no scenes or dialogues yet. It's theater. Who gives a fuck? I do. God, you're being negative. I'm not being negative, Charlotte. Well, don't hear it as criticism. - No... - Wait! Since when did defending yourself become being negative? \ "negative, \" it isn't the right word. - \"Stiff\"? - \"Stiff\"! That's what I mean. You need to be more open to letting - other people help you, James. - Are you kidding me? At this point, I need everyone on planet Earth, and Neptune, and his or her moons to help me out. What we want and what we'll allow for ourselves are very often at odds. Trust me, sweetheart, I am this close to drinking and fucking my way into gay heaven. Drinking and fucking? In heaven, you say? Good morning, baby. You're naked. - I am? - Not naked enough. Fooled ya. You're a fucking god! Get in here, you. I'm a hugger. You smell like Hawaii. - Doesn't he? - Au naturel, lovely lady. Au naturel! Christ. I need to get laid. Another celebrity client, Mr. Hands? - James. - Chill, Jay. He's our playwright! I...! I am a ginormous fan of your play. Really? 'Cause I've read otherwise. - Don't ever listen to Jay. - I don't. - The fuck! - We'll talk. - Coffee? - Is it organic? - No. - He ran out. No, but we plan to pillage some more after we rape the local townswomen. - Ha! - James! - I'm kidding, Charlotte! Jeez! - No, it's cool. - Right, Charlotte? - James knows rape isn't funny. Of course James knows rape isn't funny. - Jesus Christ, woman. - Fuck off. Charlotte and James are having a little falling out. - Over a planet. - Neptune. It's all good. Is it? Is it \ "all good\"? I'm sorry, I loathe that expression. I... I just do. I always have. No, I mean, just... Is feeling the testosterone drain out of your body on a daily basis \ "all good\"? Is it \ "all good\" when little kids in Yemen get blown up on school buses on a daily basis on their way to summer camp? Is it \ "all good\" when 90% of mankind lives on less than a dollar a day? Breathe, brother. Breathe! They make testosterone boosters. Okay. Please, do not tell me to breathe, okay? I am breathing. Now. See? I'm breathing. That's breathing. Breathing's actually involuntary. My brain will not allow me not to breathe. I don't have to tell my brain to do that, okay? I actually couldn't speak these words right now if I weren't breathing. So I'm actually breathing and thinking and speaking, right? So, I'm breathing, thinking, and speaking. Look, here's coffee. So I'm actually drinking coffee and thinking and breathing and speaking. Good morning. I think Callisto means \ "breathe with intention.\" - Exactly. - Well, I'll give it a whirl on Monday before my foreclosure. But are they happy? - Who, the bank? - No. The 90% of all mankind living on less than a dollar a day. Excellent point. Them. Well, we'll ask them when we go into town to stock up on cigarettes and organic coffee. And red wine. And a mop. Sorry. I saw dirt over here. I find in my life nothing more than a shapeless mass. What I have not been defines me most. The hero's existence is simple. It goes straight to the mark. I have occupied each of these extremes, but life has always drawn me away. My life has contours less firm. I recognize the working of fate, but too many paths led nowhere at all. And my end now fast approaches. Bravo. Thank you. Thank you! Devastating. That's huge, coming from you. - You found so many levels. - It felt really good. Yes, well. You can't teach levels, baby. You either have them or you don't. I did change a few of the words. You personalized it. Good actors do that. We all do. Quite a bit, actually. You gave it oomph! Well, someone had to. Great writers need better editors, right? - Is that a quote? - No, I just came up with it. Brilliant. \"I find in my life... nothing more than a shapeless mass. What I have not been defines me most.\" We can all relate. I don't want to end up like that. Like Euphrates? Right! Now you have too much potential. I mean, look at you. You've got it all. The face, the brains, the body, the talent. I read your play, by the way. - Well, most of it. - When? Jay gave it to me this morning, right before they went to get our groceries. - It's just an outline. - No, it's brilliant. That's what it is, mate. The world needs to hear it. The universe needs you to tell that story. So timely. The genocide of Native Americans continues. I saw it last week with my own eyes. I have videos. None of this shit has changed, and you're writing about it. - It's fucking brilliant. - Wow. Thanks. And you do massage? I am a massage therapist, yes. How about reflexology? Yes, I studied in Shanghai. Do my feet! Aww. Christ, what a grip! You have such soft skin. - Don't! - You smell so pure. I am. Why, I'm just a delicate little hothouse flower. Blanche fucking Dubois! Now there's a part. But I'm running out of time to play that one, and fast. That's good. You went to China to learn how to rub feet? My dad was there doing business for a year when I was on break from Deerfield. You live up to your name, Mr. Hands. God, you'd make a killing in Los Angeles. They're always on the hunt for body workers out there. Daddy would murder me if I didn't finish my school this time. Need to finish something. Anything. \"Time to get serious, Carly. Your mother and I, we're getting too old for this. Too many bites at the apples.\" Aww. They love you. I'm such a fuck-up. What? My dad wants me in the shipping business. Plus, Jay doesn't want to leave New York. He loves it, and my family loves him. Go figure, right? They want us to get married. My mother wants grandkids. Well, what do you want? I don't want to disappoint them. Well, I never gave two shits about disappointing anyone. I saw something and I just fucking went for it. Never got married, never had babies, so there's never been anyone there that I could disappoint. Do I have regrets? Fuck yes. I regret I didn't get married, I regret... I never had babies. I'm contradicting myself, I know, but those regrets were zilch compared to the ones I'd had had I not pursued my hero's existence. Had I not lived straight to the mark. Sounds lonely. I got over all that shit a long time ago, and now I'm out of cigarettes! - We're back! - Thank God! - Did you get my cigarettes? - Yes, ma'am. One, two, three. From the tribal smoke shop. Autumn Leaf sends her regards, by the way. Autumn's a peach. - And guess what I got? - What? New coloring book. Yay! - Ever color? - Are you kidding? You should try it! It's a great time-killer, like knitting. Callisto and I were just deciding your future. - Really? - I'm all ears. We're gonna get married and have lots of babies, right, Calli? Toss me that knitting, will you, darling? Callisto was reciting Euphrates' death plea. Was this before or after your backyard symposium - on gays and procreating? - He's a natural. Baby, go and show James your rewrites. - Wait, rewrites? - \ "Baby\"? Just a few, to make it more conversational. Um, he's an emperor on his deathbed, surrounded by the Praetorian Guard and the Roman Senate. - He's not Chatty Cathy. - I also screwed around a little bit with Hadrian's Greece speech. Oy, that. Before Euphrates kills himself, the scene with Antinous in Alexandria. Egypt, case you're wondering. - Thank you, John. - John? I love it. It's mad good. You made it more \ "conversational.\" It just wasn't flowing. - Exactly. - Interesting. - It was flowing for me. - Well, I reworked a few words and a sentence or two here and there to make it land better with a younger audience. - Important point. - But what if I don't want it to land better with a younger audience? - Why not? - You don't? - What? Everyone wants that. - Hey, maybe we read the play out loud before we rip it apart? - Sure. - So wise. You're right. It was massively uncool of me to touch a single word of your awesome play without your permission. - I apologize. - No, it's... Oof, he is stiff. I need to work on you, sexy man. He Worked on me earlier. Miss Dubois and I had a session. He made my mouth water. That sounds murky. Okay, you know what? Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for the apology. I honor your need not to change things. There's a lesson in that for all of us. Ew. So evolved, this young man right here. It's all the hot yoga. - Namaste... - Namaste... Jinx! You owe me a beer. I owe you nothing. Okay. Anyway, I got us some nice fish for tonight. - No salmon, I hope. - Nope, fresh tuna. - Okay. - Jinx again! Wait, wait, wait. What happened now to salmon and tuna? Anything from the Pacific is 1000% carcinogenic. The Atlantic too. 1000%. - I heard that. - 1000%. - I saw it online. - And on NPR. Well! We're all so fucked! I love this one. It's a unicorn. I collect unicorns. See it? I see it. Yes. Show it to James. James? Do you see it, James? Do you see the unicorn? The stars... My God. They're falling from the sky. They're really good. Bithynia has gorgeous stars. - Greece? - No, Turkey. My grandpa lived there, in a villa he built on the Black Sea before he died in his plane off Icaria. The island where people forget to die. Christ! Let's go there. We visited him every July. Papa would drink ouzo with Sprite every night, tell me and my sister the story of the stars. Artemis? Jay hates my sister. She thinks I'm not good enough for her brother. - She never said that. - Whatever. She should see a nutritionist. That's all I'm gonna say. What about your grandma? Yiayia Merope. She drowned the year my dad was born. So much tragedy. Yes. Papa never got over it. Yiayia Merope was named after the seventh Pleiad, Merope, who married Sisyphus, a mere mortal. Her sisters shunned her for it. Poor Merope. Papa said you could only see Merope when it was cold and clear \ "and the air was a corpse.\" We looked for her every night. We never found her. Papa said he only saw her in the iron sky of the January new moon. But we were never there to see that. Beautiful, right? Fuck yeah. Everybody comfy-cozies? Yes, Daddy. You missed the fabulous story of Yiayia and Merope. Sounds mythological. That's my childhood. All mythology. Mine was all New England. The only mythology we ever heard was that Dad wasn't drinking himself to death. My mom says the same thing to my dad, but she's just giving him a hard time. Sometimes, I wonder. Wonder about what? His dad's a freak of a booze hound. Freak? He's a lawyer. You'd hate him. Probably. - Wanna hit this? - Yeah, sure. Wow. Okay. Let's just continue with the play. - So disrespectful, Calli. - Sure. - Why not? - Why'd you say that? I'm gonna refresh my drink, ladies. - You say it all the time, babe. - Make me one, too. Jay, darling? Drink? I'll have a baby vodka. I'm kind of wasted. Good idea. I'll make baby's vodka. I'm pumped you two are hitting it off. - I was worried. - That's enough. Okay, boys. And girl. So, we got to Euphrates' suicide, right? No, we're still on that. - The scene before. - Shit. Okay. Christ, this thing is long. I like this scene. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thoughts? Notes? Revisions? No. It's just heartbreaking. - You got it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No tea, no shade, but this says a lot about you. All my older gay clients romanticize their past. Well, we silver sneakers usually do. Really? That's why you wrote this Russian novel of a play? To romanticize your personal crisis as an aging gay man, as seen through the eyes of a second-century Roman emperor and his 14-year-old boy-toy? We are children, my generation. - No, we're not. - Yes, you are. We're actually more sophisticated. - Baby vodka? - Thank you! No, it's like, everything's changed now. And nothing I remember is there anymore. And what about what I don't remember remembering being there? I... I feel like a phantom. Like... like an age-inappropriately-dressed phantom, just lurking... Lurching around New York City with a nasty case of plantar fasciitis. Now, many people... not me, of course, but most... well, let's call them, quote-unquote, \ "older people\" I know... -Quote-unquote, \ "your peers.\" -Well, if you will... See, they romanticize their past because they're utterly traumatized by what's coming down the pipe. Well, this is different. You actually think you had it better than today's young gays? Absolutely. Yes, I do. Despite all the AIDS and the stigma and inequality, and the no marriage and no kids... - What? - Not on the page, not on the stage, right, Callisto? I'm the wrong person to ask. Wait. Charlotte, why does this threaten you? Are you serious? I was the one marching and protesting to save your lives, you remember? And all the gays thank you. Didn't you get our card? I lost out of the biggest job of my career because of it. - Wait a minute. - No, it's true. No, it was way more complicated than that. No, it wasn't complicated, James. Okay. 1992, right? I was flat-out fired from the Lusitania sequel. The front page of Variety, the whole bit. And then, if you will recall, I was blacklisted in Hollywood by the studio that made $1 billion off me because I sued them because they refused to hire gay actors. Your peers, whom they branded \ "production risks.\" Christ. I had to finally grovel and take that shit part on Beyond Riches. Christ, I was so fucking broke. A crap show that crowned me \ "Hollywood's biggest bitch\"! You were in the running long before that, honey lamb. Go to hell. My God, Beyond Riches is, like, the greatest television show ever made. It was a colossal piece of shit, honey. And Down the Lusitania 2 was a career-ending epic flop for everyone involved. You dodged a major bullet on that deal, sweetheart. A sequel to a movie about a sinking ship? There were survivors, arsehole. Let's agree to disagree. We never acted it out. Down The Lusitania 2 never came to our movie theater. You acted out my movie? With costumes. Nicked from a hooker in colonial Williamsburg. It was quite the production. - Shit! - I played you, of course. \"Lady Amelia Herbert, cabin E14. Do drop in.\" - Aww. How old were you? - 14, 15? So, Euphrates kills himself? Yes. Wow. Okay. I thought you'd be grateful. - Grateful? - Yes, grateful. Adverb of \ "gratitude.\" Ever heard of it? - It's actually an adjective... - Grateful and honored that some sad little gay boy in a dress in Tidewater, Virginia wanted to be you. Whilst sleeping with ye olde blacksmith! Ye olde blacksmith's head apprentice. - Get your story straight. - It's your story, honey. When and if you're ever honored like that, do drop in and we'll talk. Are you serious? What? \ "If\"? Yes. \ "If.\" You don't think I'm good enough to make it? Well, I'm just perceiving and reading between the lines. Whatevs, Lady A. - Jay... - Let's keep reading. - Good idea. - What page? 28. Fix me another drink, Adonis. Here we go. Jay, did you day drink? Who the hell had time? We were too busy chasing down cheap booze and organic smokes from here to East Jesus and back. Right, James? I still can't believe we trucked our butts all the way to a fucking Indian reservation to pick up organic smokes. Who the fuck smokes \ "Minnihana Lights\"? Excuse me? First of all, \"Native American, \" not \"Indian.\" And I smoke Minnihana Lights to support the tribal women who make them. All right, let's all calm down, okay? - Jay... - What? I'm calm. I'm calm as a motherfucking cucumber. Where's my fucking drink? I might go to bed. You're not going anywhere, Lady A. - No, Charlotte, please. - Here, come sit with me. Okay. Protect me from your future husband. And the mother of your children. Yes, you two sit there nice and pretty. \"Perceiving and reading between the lines.\" All right, I'll read Hadrian. - You do that. - Jay, enough. Relax! Toss me a Minnihana Light, Lady A! Lighter! Would you like me to smoke it for you as well? I hate when he day drinks. What? I'm just getting into character. What's wrong with that? Hit it, Hadrian. \"You are flushed and confused. Your voice is low and strange. What torments you?\" \ "Nothing.\" \"Your eyes look straight at me, yet they lack the gentleness that I marvel.\" \ "So?\" \"I feel judged with harshness and suspicion, and not as a god by his adorer.\" \"You are absolute master over but one being... mine.\" \"Then where is my boy, ready to cast off his dagger and belt of gold -to lie with his master?\" -Okay, hold up, hold up, y'all. \ "Belt of gold\"? What is that? Just what it sounds like. Yeah, it's a belt made out of gold for your dagger. - Okay. - While we're stopped, I do not believe that this man is the absolute master of your being. But is he? Look at him. - He is. - You're 14. Why do I take my own life then? For the same reason Euphrates takes his. - You've read Hamlet, right? - Of course I have. I know, I know: \ "To me or not to me.\" - Jesus. - What's your point? Okay, let's continue. \"Why do you charge me to carry to Euphrates your permission?\" \"He is sick. He is old. His life no... No longer offers him -anything worth the living.\" -Depressing. Hey, why are you so petulant? - You sound like Bette Davis. - James! You know, maybe I'd like to hear Callisto in the part. Shit. Would you now, maybe? It's Jay's part. No. Would the playwright like to maybe hear Callisto - in the part? - James. - No? - Of course you would. - Be honest. - Okay, yeah, maybe. Maybe? Maybe \"it's creepy that some lecherous old dude lusts after a 14-year-old boy he picked up on a camping trip.\" - Lecherous? - Camping trip? - Jay. - Your words, Callisto, - not mine. - He's drunk. - He's drunk... - No. No! It's right here, in black and white and fuchsia highlighter. \"Isn't it creepy that some lecherous old dude lusts after a 14-year-old boy he picked up...\" \ "...on a camping trip?\" - You can be a supreme asshole. - Why did you do that? - Do what? - You upset him. - This is everything to him. - He is a mess. Am I? Isn't this what we're doing here this weekend, reading and giving feedback? Your feedback, as it were. - Show a little class. - Here we go. Lover, pour me another glass of wine. Pour your own damn glass of wine. Now I'm definitely going to bed! No, Jay is... Please. He's... Jay's not in his right mind. Are you kidding? I feel fabulous. Fuckin' done. Done with that. Want company... James. Sanctuary is left open... Sacked by Nero. Corinth in ruins, yet Greece lives on. Unchanged since Aeacus first breathed in the lavender honey in mirth. Palestra's rugged shore, where Charmides and Socrates wrestle no more. - How was your swim? - Great. Was the water warm? Perfect. Did any of the ancient peoples see you? - Ancient peoples? - My neighbors. Want another drink? - I'll take a beer, sure. - You got it. Sorry about earlier. That whole mess with Jay and your script. It's all right. - I'm used to it. - He's very direct. Says it like it is. Funny, he says the same thing about you. I didn't understand the attraction at first. - Now I do. - Okay. Seriously. I believe you. And for the record, Hadrian did not pick up Antinous on a camping trip, okay? It was a barbecue. No, it was. Seriously. Where do you think barbecues came from? Yeah. Antinous, he was a hottie. I mean, he was... oof! The Romans, they treated foreigners just like animals. I mean, to them, he was just a... human sex toy. Tell me more. Well, they fed each other grapes, and then they banged each other's brains out from Britain to Bethania and back. I know it well. But, their love endured. To Hadrian and Antinous. It's heaven here. I love your place. Your patio, your fountain. I love this fountain! Did you do all this yourself? No. None of it. - Who did? - William. - William, your gardener? - No, William, my life partner. My... ex-life partner, as it were. He made everything here beautiful. I mean, I'm barely holding it all together. This is bad. You should see this garden when Will was tending it. It was our sanctuario. Did you did you see any fireflies? - I saw a few down at the docks. - Yeah? You see that, row of pine trees there along the property line? Yes, I love them. Yeah, they used to twinkle, just yellow and green. Like Christmas in July. Not anymore. Damn. You ever hear a nightingale sing? Wait, nightingales exist? - What? - I don't know. - Yes! Of course they do! - I was... I'm mistaken. I always thought they were magical fairy tale birds, like... like mermaids and dragons. - No! - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. So, how does a nightingale sing? Like it can't decide what song to sing. So it stays up all night and sings 'em all, like Judy at Carnegie Hall. Who's Judy? Nobody. Just an old friend. From a fairy tale. You are so cute. Be grateful for the compliment. Well, thank you! I shall treasure it always. - Stop. - No, I'm just... I'm just uncomfortable. I'm just really uncomfortable. I'm just, like, Woody Allen uncomfortable. I know him! He... married his daughter. Yeah. I mean, well... - Take this off. - No, I'm good. Take off the dang shirt, Woody. Okay, okay. All right. I'll take one for the team. How do I... Just gonna make sure... Wait... You're not very good at this, are you? Like, good at what? Letting a boy have his way with you? - Your fiancé... - He knows. He knows you're having your way with me? No. That I like older men. - Relax. - I'm relaxed. I'm totally relaxed. This is... I'm not... Okay. Wow. So where is Jay, anyway? Passed out somewhere, wasted. I noticed. He's done. New York City. It's exhausting. I want this. God... looking good naked. That's what everyone's after. I don't care what anyone says. You don't need to look good naked. You've got a brain. - Okay... - And somewhat of a personality. I bet you say that to all the older men you try to have your way with. I want to be remembered for more than looks and a body. High hopes indeed. See? Now you're ridiculing me again. - Again? No. - Yes. It's okay. - I'm sorry. I... I... - You can't help it. Sarcasm. It's in your veins. Oof. So smart. \"Our brains will always betray us.\" William says that all the time. He's right. You know, it used to be that I would think something, and then at the same time, I would think, \"Jesus Christ, James, that's not right. Stop thinking that.\" And then I would, you know, stop thinking that. But now, you know... I mean, lately? More and more... No, I just... lately, I just hear these... these thoughts. I hear... I hear these words just flying, just spewing, just, like, you know, projectile vomiting out of my mouth, and I'm just like, where the hell did that come from? Like, where did you learn all this garbage? Like, \"Stop talking, James. Stop talking. Mayday, mayday. Stop talking. Everybody is gonna think you're nuts.\" But you know? They're right. I am nuts. - No, you're not. - No, I am. I am absolutely nuts. I am that crazy-haired gay guy with irreversible sun damage who says nutty things. - You don't say nutty things. - No, I... please, honey. I'm like fucking Richard Simmons. Legendary. - Right? - Okay, I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the body goes. We know that. We can... You know, we can see that. But it's, like, you know, what they... What they don't tell you is how the mind slowly starts to slip away. Just day by day, cell by cell, it just your brain, it just gets pissed away, you know? I mean, not the one that, you know, drives a car, or, you know, writes a play, or watches porn. No, no, I'm talking about the the brain that fires up the graveyard shift. The one that wakes you up in the middle of the night. The one that works overtime. The one that loses the reality of the reality, in the reality. Pragmatikotita. All that anger. And then, one day... ...\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\" I love that book. I'm gonna get another beer. Do you want one? Sure. Yes, yes, yes! I could get so used to this setup right here. Fuck Fire Island. I want to be as far away from the beautiful people as possible. Run away somewhere tomorrow, like up here, like you! By myself. Drinking a beer, smoking a bowl. Every night, all summer long. Doing nothing whatsoever but writing plays all day, and searching for fireflies and nightingales at night. Right? What's up, man? - No, what's going on? - Nothing. What happened? Whoa. James, you okay? Hey, it's okay. It's all good, man. Shh. It's all good. Happy Sunday, everybody. I wish I had better news, but... Julie Beth just texted me. She said that Running was to be released from prison today. The fascist pigs are holding Running and several other council members pending further investigation of, quote-unquote, \ "suspicious tribal activity.\" Frustrating for me, of course, because I'm still in paradise. \ "I'm still in paradise.\" Recharging this old soul. Ha! How about a little tour? What? Hello? Hello! Anybody here? Is the coast clear? Hello? I'm hearing myself. Hello? Anyhow, Big Bluffers, feast your eyes on paradise. Don't you just want to nest in the trees and eat all the flowers? Don't do it, Running Water! They're doused in Deer Out. - You're naked! - What the fuck? Joe! You've been there the whole time? It's Jay, okay? Jay? Jay Mulch. Like the fertilizer. Groundcover, asshat. Listen, guys, I've got to go. Remember, we are the Big Bluff. Vegan forever. Namaste. Mwah. Peace. # blessed! #setlife. Shut up. - Where is he? - Who? Jesus Christ, woman! Magic Hands. Lives in a speedo, smells like Hawaii. You're a frickin' piece of work, dude. - Who isn't? - Not me. I'm normal. Excruciatingly so. That is true, actually. You are. - Was he with you? - When? - Last night. - Where? - At Dunkin Donuts! - He gave me a massage, then he went for a midnight kayak. Midnight kayak. Drunk and high. Charming. - Smile, guys... - No, I don't... No! You did that on purpose, you idiot! - It was an accident! - An accident! How do you work that out? I didn't want my picture taken. That feels significant. So you threw my phone into the fucking fountain. You weren't holding it tight enough. Ha! That's my only lifeline to Running Water. - How ironic. - Shit. I hope I stored all my shit in the clouds. - God, I hope so too. - You know, your shit isn't actually stored in actual clouds. - It isn't! - Don't ruin it for her. Where's the rice? It's in the cupboard next to the fridge. It might be organic. Nothing in here is organic! She's a goddamn delight. - Where are you going? - To find Callisto! - I'll come with you. - No, no, you're naked. What? I forgot my unicorn. Does this even work? Nope. Once it's soaked, it's done. - It's over. Bye-bye. - Shit. I really hope I stored all my shit in the clouds. Well, hope springs eternal, Lady A... God, yes, that whole thing with Jacob, Jeremy, Judith, whatever the fuck his name is. And I've been nice to him all this time because I thought he was your friend. You've been a real doll. Thank you. Did you have sex? You and the boyfriend? I never kiss and tell, Aunt Eller. Well, it's just so interesting why you boys insist on objectifying each other. - 'Cause we like it. - That's bad. - Is it? - I mean, in terms of every spiritual teaching I've ever read, yes. I didn't realize butt-fucking was covered in a course in miracles. Is everything a joke, James? In this conversation? You drink too much. Clouds your judgment. - Judgment of what? - Reality. Actress, heal thyself. - I do the work. - What work? - The work on myself. - Really? Is that the secret sauce to becoming a special person? An enlightened being? A chosen one? An 11:11? Shamelessly demanding that the world cater to each and every one of your ridiculous food and beverage whims? That work? Not whims. Priorities. Whose priorities? The universe's, maybe. You know, I hate to tell you something, sweetheart, okay, but the universe? Girlfriend don't care if you eat your own offspring. Well, I disagree. Well, we'll never know now, will we? - Some of us do. - Do we, now? Well, if you did the work, you'd understand. Understand what? Some mythical pile of piping hot rat crap? - Stop attacking me. - I don't attack you! Yes, you do. You always attack me. I mean, even in your fucking play, you've turned me into ashes! I am fucking dust. Get back in your urn. And what the hell is that and where are they going? My God. Callisto. Jesus. You want one? What? Do you want one? A drink? No, a hot air balloon ride. - I'm good. - Table for one. Merci, monsieur. Why isn't he coming in? Should we go get him? He told me he's never been inside a hospital. I mean, how is that possible? I was born in that hospital. Who is Jay calling? His in-laws. They love him. - Why? - His... skill sets? - Did the police call them? - Police? There'll be an investigation, right? My God, I hope not. - What do you mean? - Jesus Christ. Maybe you should call Will. - Why? - I don't know. He's always so good at situations like this. He... has had a lot of practice. My gran committed suicide young. Well... in her mid-50s. Dad said the fairies took her because she was too beautiful for this world. Where did they take her? Jury's still out. It's terrible being discontent. Yeah. You're always so... misinterpreted. Ha. All the time. By everyone, everywhere. So fucking exhausting. Well more for anyone around you, I suppose, than yourself. And you can't... won't... Settle for any one thing or personal feeling. And so you roam about the world from this beautiful moment or place to the next beautiful moment or place. But it always comes back to you. In your flat. Alone. Making baked beans on toast. That's fucking weird. - I didn't mean to say... - Don't start. - Drink? - No! - Charlotte? - No! How is Callisto? He'll live. He's lucky to have you. - He'll be fine. - He always is. You know, you guys can stay here a few extra days while he recuperates, if you want. - Are you fucking high? - Yeah, I guess. - A little, yeah. - James! James! We would've stayed at the fucking hospital if our shit wasn't here. His parents are driving up from Greenwich to get us. God. I told Callisto to wait in the car. - Is that wise? - Why? What... You two want another crack at him? - Hey, we're all adults here. - Are we? Look, I'm going to the car and keep him company. You drink too much. This from the coloring book critic. Ha. If only your play was a tenth as witty. You've got it all figured out, don't you? I certainly have you figured out. Who doesn't? At least the booze and the bitterness. The booze and the bitterness! Quelle poetry. - Use it in your play. - I will. Hadrian can woo Antinous with it over cocktails at the Colosseum. If I use it, I'll send you royalties. - As if. - You know, listen, nothing happened between Callisto and me, okay? Nothing. Wait. You think... He was drunk, you fool. It was more than that. James, look. Don't take this the wrong way... Callisto's a fuck-up, okay? A beautiful fuck-up, yes. A... a very sexy, very charming, very flexible, very fabulous disaster. He fucks things up. He's my hero. Come what may, I love him. And he loves me. Truly, deeply. We don't have to fetishize each other into some porn cartoon fantasy. We can just be two men, together. We can get married. We can have kids, just like everybody else, much to your horror and dismay. Shame those asshole babies never live. When did you become so barren? \ "Barren\"? Your world is barren. Your play is barren. Well. You have nothing to bring into this world. Nothing to birth. Nothing to bring. You are barren. And I pity you. Don't pity me. Can't help it. You are our worst fear. What did I miss? Nothing. We were just, chatting. Maybe I should think about what I'm doing. Yeah, you should. I'd like to stay, but... A free trip to New York is very tempting. Where's my fucking bag? - Yeah, it really is. - I could see Heidi. I mean, she could do with my support, poor thing. And my asshole agent talked about taking me out to lunch. And I could finally see Wendy's play thing. - Is it still on? - Yeah, it's about to close. Shit. I can't miss it, then. I mean, I'd never hear the end of it. Yeah. She has such mommy issues. I could meet with Peter Shine at New Horizons about your play. - Talk you up. - Yeah. I mean, I know you guys don't like each other, - but I could talk up the play. - I like him. You are ready to have people read it, right? You decide. Well, I mean... I don't know. What can you lose? If he likes it, he likes it. If he doesn't, well, no biggie, right? - Right. - So, that's my plan. I think. - Sounds good. - Okay if I take this? I could give it to Peter, say it's from you. - A peace offering. - I hate wine. - Now you're mad. - I'm not mad. I know how you get. No. Charlotte, why are we friends? Well... because we - we love each other. - No, I mean... I know we love each other, but I mean... Why are we friends? Why are we friends? You! You! I need to get packed. [Footsteps receding] Hey. How you feeling? Like... an idiot. Where's Jay? He's upstairs, packing. Your folks are coming. I ruined your weekend. No. You did not ruin my weekend. Still time. I should've stayed here with you instead of screwing around in the middle of the night in a kayak on the ocean. No, adventure called you away. I get that. - You do? - Yeah. You wanna follow me? Where? Give me your phone. Yeah. One sec. - It's locked. - Um, it's 1... 19.1963. It's William's birthday. There. Now you're following me. Wow, that's quite the picture there. - Keep scrolling. - Jesus Christ! Let me see. Yeah, that one's lit, I know. Yeah, it's \ "lit, \" indeed. - I gotta push the envelope. - Pushed. - What about this one? - What's... Wait, is that a salad between your legs? - Yes. - . Well, it looks good. It's delicious. Huge portions. Great value. You should try one. - I feel like I just did! - Don't make fun. - I'm not! I... - It's how I support myself. Yeah, I know, honey. It's great. Got to shake it 'til you make it, right? Well, never worked for me. Of course, we were still using two tin cups and a string when that opportunity presented itself. Who's this? - That's me. - Aww! Awkward teenager. I hate that picture. Why? I wasn't working out then. - Who's that with you? - Prom date. Your girlfriend? Sister. Artemis. You took your sister to the prom? She took me. It's a whole Greek thing. Well, we all have our awkward phases. Mine ended last year. They're here. They're in the driveway. Boy, they look pissed. Charlotte's coming with us. It just made more sense. Callisto. Let's go. I'm not leaving. You're not leaving? Charlotte, will you please go tell Callisto's mother to come inside? No! No? Would you like me to go and tell Zeus and Hera that you've decided to live here for the rest of your life? That you found yourself in the arms of a middle-aged man and can't let go? Well... thanks for a fun weekend. It was really fun. Let's do it again real soon. We'll be in the car, Callisto. I'll call you again, darling. Honey, you gotta get in that car. Have you not observed how I've given death much thought? Since I first observed you, apart from all the others, a young boy, half in a dream. What do you suppose I saw in that half-dream? Youth, and beauty. And the inglorious but safe ending which life brings to all who accept its slow dulling from where? I feel like I lived a whole life here. ♪ Had to come rock and rolling
