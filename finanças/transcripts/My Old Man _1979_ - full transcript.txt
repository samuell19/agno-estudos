Hello, Matt. Phoebe. What are you doing here, Frank? You don't belong here. I come for my daughter, Phoebe. Em wanted her with us and that's where she's staying. A daughter ought to be with her father before an aunt or an uncle. (man) He's not wrong, Phoebe. He ain't got no rights to her. I want her, Matt. She's my flesh and blood and I want her. You ain't a fit father. What are you gonna do for her? Drag her from race track to race track? Shh. What's wrong with that? She'd have fun. Hmm. It's summer. Kid ought to have fun in the summertime. Come on, Jo. Matt. You shouldn't have come here, Frank. (dog barking in the distance) What are you doing? She needs some lunch. Let her be. She didn't have any breakfast. She needs to eat. What she needs is some time alone. (birds chirping) (knocking) (door opening) You can't come in here. (Frank) I got something I want to give her. You can give it to me. I'll give it to her. I want to give it to her myself. It's something of Em's. Let me have a minute on the porch with her. Come on, Phoebe. (whispering) I don't trust him. Come on! (dog barking in the distance) (clearing throat) Well, ya-- ya look like I thought you would. Yeah, so do you. About a foot taller maybe. A foot? Yeah. See, that's the only picture I ever had of you. (chuckling) She sure was pretty. Yeah, your mother gave me that just before we split up. I thought you ought to have it. I'll be right back. (door opening) (door closing) Where do you think you're going? I'm going with him. Oh, no, you're not. Just for the summer. I'll be back by school. You're not going any place with that man. He's no good. Goodbye, Aunt Phoebe. Bye, Uncle Matt. Thanks for everything. Uh, you sure you're doing the right thing? I'm doing what I need to do. Thanks a lot. Come back. You know, if it doesn't work out. Okay. Bye. ** How come you're staring at me? How come you forgot about me? I didn't forget about you. Then how come you never came to see me? Your mother wouldn't let me. But you did try? Yeah... once. Once? Yeah. She wouldn't let me in the door. Once?! You call that trying, huh? Aw, I thought you'd probably be better off bein' with her. Why? Oh, I don't know. She was your mother. And you were my father. How come you came along if you're gonna be mad at me? I made a big mistake. So, turn this thing around and take me back. Hey, I came a long way out of my way to get you. Well, tell me something about yourself. Like what? Well, I don't know nothing about you. Terrific. So, what do you want to know? Well... ... what grade you in at school? You don't know that, huh? I bet you don't even know how old I am either. 16? Right? Bingo. (sighing) Mmm! How come you drink while you're driving? Well, I haven't had an accident yet, honey. (tires screeching) What's going on? We better eat something. I'm not hungry. Well, I am. I didn't have any dinner. You know, maybe you ought to eat something and sober up a little bit. Listen, kid. Don't ever tell me what I ought to do. (fizzling) I didn't order this. It's okay, I did. You drink coffee? When I want to stay awake. Your mom let you drink coffee? No. Bring me a glass of milk here, ma'am. Hey, what's wrong with coffee? 'Cause you ain't got no reason to stay awake. Where are we sleeping tonight? In the van. Where do you think? In the van? That's a horse van. That's right. Mmm. Got any money? $5. Why? Well, let me have it. How come? 'Cause I ain't got no small bills on me. Miss? Here you go, baby. Keep a buck for yourself, huh? (woman) Okay, thanks. (cash register dinging) (breathing heavily) Sure smells in here. You'll get used to it. So, how am I supposed to change? (horn honking) What do you mean? I usually sleep in a nightgown. Oh... well, it's, uh, it's pitch black in here. Nobody gonna look at ya. I'm your father, for cryin' out loud. So, where's the bathroom? This ain't a motel. You go back to the diner or go outside. That's what I do. You always live in this? You mean the van? Yeah. Yeah. When I got money, I stay in motels. You and mom live in this thing? (horn honking) When we first got married... (horn honking continues) ... it was about half this size. We had fun. Nobody minded. You're drinking again. I need it to help me go to sleep. I don't think I'm gonna be able to sleep either. Just get your clothes off. Well, we could talk or something. About what? We got a lot to talk about, right? You want to cover all those years tonight? Huh? Come on. ** Did you love Mom? Yeah. More than anybody ever knew. Then how come you left her? I didn't leave her. She kicked me out. She tell you I left her? She said you didn't wanna be tied down anymore. Hmm. Well, I tried. She said she didn't wanna go on living the way you'd been living. She wanted me to have a normal life. Well, I didn't want to lose her. So, I quit the horses. I pumped gas for a while. That didn't work out. Stocked groceries for a while and that didn't work out either. She said it was the gambling. That you couldn't quit. Is that all she said? That's about it. She ever say anything good about me? Well, she said I had your temper. But she used to smile when she said that. She used to get worried because I liked horses so much. She used to hate it when I'd go out and ride. Well... ... when I first met her, she loved horses. I remember we had this exercise boy once. I was training my first champion for a very important race. She caught this kid whipping the horse real hard. So I had to fire him. Your mom took over. And I want to tell you, she was the best exercise kid I ever had in my life. You ride? You any good at it? Pretty good. How good? ** (Jo) You mean you haven't even seen him yet? (Frank) That's right. I know one of them's a two-year-old colt and the other's a four-year-old filly. And that's all you know about them? I told you. Trainer quit. I heard they were looking for someone, so I called up the owner and he told me come on. Is that how you always do business? I was expecting you earlier. Yeah, I know. I had to stop, pick up my daughter. Oh, how'd you do? Jo, this is Mr. Kiley. Hi. Hi. This is my son Roy. Can I ask you something, Mr. Butler? Sure. About Little Sister. When she won the big race in 1966, is it true she had a bum ankle? Now, where'd you hear that? I read it somewhere. (laughing) That's just hype, son. (chuckling) I knew it. My son's a horse scholar. 'Round our house we say he's full of horse sense. (laughing) What about the big race Skippy Yellow won at Pimlico, Mr. Butler? What about it? Did you know you had a winner? Well, son, I tell ya, I can pretty well tell a winner as soon as I lay eyes on 'em. A look's about all I need. He's got it in him to make Phi Beta Kappa. All he wants to do is hang around here. Ha. Well, track's not a bad place to be. It's a waste of time for a lad with a brain like his. Now, this is Cousin Doris. My personal favorite. Mm-hmm. Made me a bundle in the past couple years. That's a good-looking horse. Hey, Frank. Look at this one, he's beautiful. Now, this one's called Gilford. He's been giving me a lot of trouble. He's a little wild. He's not living up to his promise. Isn't he something? Now, you be careful. He's temperamental. Aw, he wouldn't hurt me. Would you, Gilford, huh? (Frank) Not winning for you, huh? My last trainer said he's a rogue. Nah, he doesn't look like a rogue to me. What's a rogue? A horse that hates humans. He's not a rogue. Beautiful. I'll be needing some kind of advance. What you have in mind? Oh, 500 bucks. I'll give you a hundred. (horse neighing) A lot of people think I'm nuts to use you. A hundred bucks sure doesn't go very far these days. You'll have to manage until the end of the month. I hope you're not planning to use that for whiskey. I don't drink anymore. Good. Glad to hear it. Roy! I'm counting on you, Frank. Don't let me down. (horse neighing) It's a real pleasure to meet you, Mr. Butler. Nice meeting you too, Roy. Would it be okay if I sort of hung around with you while I'm on vacation? Well, that's up to your dad. Thanks. Hey, look who I found! Frank. (man) Frank. (crowing) How you doin', Rooster? I'm doing okay, Frank. Glad you're back. Thanks. (man) Hey, Frank. Hi, Mule. Can't sit at the bar, honey. You gotta be 18. Go on over there and sit down at the table, honey. Want a hamburger or something? No thanks. What are you drinking, Frank? Soda. Soda? Yeah, I'm on the wagon. (laughing) On the wagon? How about the kid? I'm on the wagon too. All right. Two sodas, one draft beer. She don't look a thing like you, Frank. You sure he's your father, honey? Hey. Watch out how you talk in front her, will you, Mule? Just kidding. She just lost her mother, for crying out loud. Hey, Frank. Remember Tamburlaine? Good horse. You rode the hell out of him. You remember where? Glen Island. You remember how much the purse was? 25,000 smackeroos. Yeah. You remember what year? 1959. Right! (laughing) Ah, we were living high off the hog back in those days. Huh, Rooster? Yeah. I wasn't even married. How is your wife? Didn't you hear? She ran out on me, Frank. Couldn't take the life. Well... some stick, some don't. Hey, let Shimmy know if you want me to ride for you. (crowing) I sure will, Rooster. See, Rooster leans right in a race. He crows like that when he's passing another jockey. That's why they call me Rooster. Hello, Frank. Let me buy you a drink, Frank. No, thanks. What are you mad about? No matter what you think, I'm still your friend. Yeah, some friends. Well, I always ask about you. Don't I always ask about him? George here rode all your winners. Didn't he? He's the best jockey you ever had. Let's go, Jo. Huh? Let's go now. So, what was that all about? Don't worry about it. I'll be right out. Your flask is empty again? Hey, listen. If you don't like what you see, why don't you split? I don't know if I want a kid tagging around after me, putting me down for everything I do anyway. What are you mad at me for!?! And remember this... you're the kid, I'm the father! Get over here and sit down. You wait there 'til I come out. ** (birds chirping) Hey, Doc! Morning, Frank. What do you think about my new horse out there, Gilford? He's a beauty, ain't he? How's his temperament? Oh, he's been real gentle, Doc. Good, that's good. Say, who you gonna bet in the race this afternoon? I'm only placing one bet today. Scarsdale Hannah in the fourth. Oh... thanks. (man on TV) ... first, it's first. Dale Hannah in front by a length, Smarty Marty is second by three quarters of a length. Intermezzo third, moving up on the outside... Come on, Scarsdale Hannah! Come on! Now it's Smarty Marty in front. Scarsdale Hannah is dropping back. Smarty Marty in front by a head. Intermezzo is second and Scarsdale Hannah. Intermezzo on the outside and Smarty Marty. Intermezzo. Smarty Marty. Scarsdale Hannah and Perry Guard. Intermezzo and Smarty Marty. And Intermezzo is the winner by a head. Smarty Marty second. Scarsdale Hannah... (crowd cheering) I had some information from a very reliable source. You get great information. Nine ball in the corner pocket. (man) Nice shot, Robert. Care to play another one, Frank? Just a minute. Got any money on ya? No. That's it. Let's go, Jo. And even if I did have any more money on me, I wouldn't give it to you anyway. Why not? Because you're always losing. My luck will change. And I don't like gambling either. (birds chirping) She's fantastic! Just keep the time. A minute, three and four tenths. That's more like it. You were right about the blinders. You bet I'm right. Okay, I'm gonna enter him. (laughing) All right. ** You want some help? You muck stalls? (chuckling) I've mucked stalls before. You have, huh? Since I was a kid. Okay. You looked pretty good riding Gilford today. Yeah, we're good together. We understand each other. Women jocks are the coming thing. Oh, no. I promised my mom I'd be a school teacher. The day I graduate from college I'm gonna be back here training horses. I want to be first class. Like your old man. Did he ever tell you about a horse called Skippy Yellow? No one believed in her except for him. He couldn't even get a jock to race her. She won a classic race. $40,000 purse. You really think I look good riding Gilford, huh? Terrific. Thanks. (man) Oh boy... I'm gonna see you one buck, Chubby. Hey, Shimmy. Huh? I'd like to use Rooster in a couple of races. Which ones? Let's see. Second on Wednesday and the eighth on Saturday. Give me a minute and I'll check my book. Give me one. Hiya, Frank. You guys must be hard up for card players. You let anything play with you these days. Hey, let it go, Frank. The past's the past. Not for me. You got your man for the two races, Frank. Who's gonna see my ten bucks? I'm entering Gilford... second race on Wednesday. Horse wearing blinkers. Who's riding him? What's, uh, Rooster's real name? I forgot. Clyde Barrett. Clyde Barrett, that's my jock. ** (horse neighing) (horse whinnying) (man on PA) Two-year-olds in the second race may now move to the paddock area. That's you, boy. Let me have him. Come on. ** Good. Mr. Kiley. Hey, Doc. Doc. (horse neighing) Whoa. Whoa, whoa. He'll calm down, Doc. Don't worry about it. You think he'll come in on the money? I don't know, Mr. Kiley. It's a horse race. He'd better. Okay. Now, um, watch him in the turns. Right. Now, hold back. I know. Get your riders up! Go. (crowd cheering) (Rooster) Easy, boy. Easy, easy, there you go, easy. (bell ringing) (man on PA) And there they go! Golden Apple is going to the front. Rigor Mortis is second. Pie in the Eye is third. Quick Fire is fourth. Julie K, fifth. Gilford is sixth... Out on the back stretch is Golden Apple in front by a head. Rigor Mortis is second by a neck. Pie in the Eye is third on the outside. Quick Fire is fourth. Julie K fifth and Gilford. Going in to the far turn it's Golden Apple in front by a leg. Rigor Mortis is second, Pie in the Eye third. Come on, come on, Gilford. And there goes Gilford moving up strongly on the extreme outside. Turning for home we have Golden Apple in front by a neck. Rigor Mortis is second by one leg. Quick Fire now moving... Come on, come on! (crowd shouting) Now it's Golden Apple in front by a neck. Quick Fire in second and now takes the lead. It's Quick Fire in front. Golden Apple and Rigor Mortis... Oh, Gilford is just gonna stay there! I know it. Come on, Gilford! Come on! What's wrong with him?! Forget it. Quick Fire on the outside. Golden Apple on the way with Pie in the Eye and Quick Fire is the winner by a half length. Golden Apple is second with Pie in the Eye finishing third. All right, Rooster, what happened? He wouldn't move, Frank. He wouldn't respond to anything I gave him. And I gave him everything I know. You got any ideas? He's temperamental, Frank. Is that my fault? Rooster was saying the track was very slow today. Yeah, and the sun was at the wrong angle and the clouds were in the wrong place. I know all about it, Frank. Come on, you gotta be patient, Mr. Kiley. Truth is the jock is in a slump. Now, come on, Frank. The jock's only 10%. The rest is the horse. You know that better than me. I need more time. I didn't expect him to win. I just expected him to come in on the money, that's all. Now, come on, he's a good horse. Just give me some more time with him. Maybe your winning days are over, Frank. Oh, what do you mean by that? I mean, I'm giving you one more chance. ** ** (coughing) So what's up, Frank? Well, it ain't me, baby. You depressed about the race, huh? The owner's depressed. Ah, you heard him. Owners... they got more money than they got sense. They want everything to happen right now. Pressure, pressure! Well, I don't work that way. If I ever saw a horse that needed more time it's Gilford. If he was my horse, I'd give him all the time in the world and I'd make the-- I'd make a big winner out of him. I mean, a really big winner. Maybe you ought to get another jockey. Who? Roy Kiley says you ought to get George Gardner. Who says?! Roy Kiley. He don't know nothing about jockeys. Are you kidding? He knows a lot. He reads everything. Well, you gotta do something more than reading, honey, to be an expert. What's the last thing you read besides the race form? I'm beginning not to like your attitude. Roy says Gilford is subtle and that he needs to be handled. And Gardner's the only jockey at our track who can ride him. Is that right? Well, let me tell you something. George Gardner ain't never gonna get on no horses of mine. He can go to hell first! What do you got against him? None of your business! Did something to me once. Yeah, well, that's just fine. Because even if he did something and it was rotten, I'd still tell you to let Gardner ride Gilford because Roy says he's the best jockey in town and Roy knows a lot more than you think. Well, that's what you know! And let me tell you something. I got a little more experience in this game than your boyfriend. I'm the best there ever was! And you can tell your boyfriend that too. My boyfriend? Yeah, your boyfriend! Look, we'll go get something to eat, okay? There. Okay. Gosh. Hello, Marie. (sighing) Is it really you? It's me. Do you know how long I've been waiting for this to happen? Well, it's happening now. I heard you was in California. Then I heard you was back. Then I didn't hear. Well, everything's okay now, Marie. I'm back in business. Oh. Who is she? She's an old friend of mine, honey. Well, why is she mad? You looking good, Marie. Looks like you took off a few pounds. Why didn't you call me at least? For cryin' out loud. I thought you was dead. Hey, what you getting mad about? I mourned for you. (chuckling) I cried my eyes out like a widow for you, and look at you. I-- listen, we ain't alone. This here's my daughter. That's Jo. Your daughter? Yeah, I told you I had a daughter. Well, I always pictured her a baby. She ain't a baby no more. Take a look at her. How are you, honey? Fine. She's a real good rider, Marie. She could be a jock. A jock? Yeah, she's a natural. She sure is pretty. Looks just like her mama. Yeah, but she's got your eyes. Hey, Marie, when you finish your personal life, could I have a cup of coffee? All right. Keep your pants on. (sighing) Come on, you drink your coffee. I'll get you menus. You know how long I've known that woman? Since before you was born. Hmm? How many horses you got, Frank? Huh? Two. Two? Good ones. Well, how can you live off just two? I remember when you trained 12 and more. Well, it's gonna happen again, Marie. Only this time... I'm going to own 'em. ** You still got the same dream, don't ya? It's going to happen. You watch. I wish you luck. You know I do. I finally got one of my big dreams, Frank. I got me a real nice house. No kidding. Yeah. I bought myself a little one. (chuckling) It's real little. But I just love it. That's wonderful, Marie. I'm real glad for you. You-- you gotta come over and see it when you have some time. I sure will. Oh, and your kid's welcome too. Can we eat now? Oh, sure. Uh... here's the menu. (sighing) What'll you have, huh? Mom was nicer. You didn't like Marie? Mom had more class. Marie's classy. Not like Mom. You want to know something about Marie? Let me tell you, no matter what was going on with me, she never lost her respect for me and she never stopped caring about me. Now, to me, that shows a lot of class. I'm not saying Marie didn't have any good points. She's probably a very nice person. All I was saying is that I think Mom was nicer. That's all. Well... I'm gonna go to sleep. (snoring) (man on PA) Gilford is third between horses by a neck. True Devotion fourth by a length... Come on, Gilford! Come on, Gilford! (man on PA) Going into the far turn it's Lovely Lana in front by a length and a half. MTB is second by a neck. March's Calm in third by a half length. True Devotion is now fourth. Gilford fifth. Come on, you can do it! You can do it! Turning in for home it's Lovely Lana in front by a head. MTB is second. March's Calm is third. And True Devotion and... Lovely Lana in front and MTB moving up on the outside. Come on! Lovely Lana, MTB, and True Devotion. Now MTB on the outside and Lovely Lana-- it's a driving finish. And MTB is the winner by a neck. Oh, he's giving up. Oh, what is this? Enter him in the claiming race. I paid 10,000 for him. I'll settle for seven. He's worth more than that. No, I want to get rid of him. Chances are, someone will claim him first time out at that price. I think you're making a mistake. I've had it with throwing away good money after bad. (horse neighing) So, you're just gonna let someone claim him? Well, what can I do? The horse is not performing. Well, you said yourself he just needs more time. (horse neighing) Well, it's not up to me. (dog barking in the distance) (horse neighing) Here, you take him. ** Means that much to you, huh? Yeah. I don't know how... ... but we got connected. You know? I can't explain it... but I don't want to lose him. Well, I'll tell you what. What if I buy Gilford for you myself? With what? I don't know. I'll think about it. ** (Andy) How are you, Frank? Hi, Andy. How you doing, Frank? Okay, Mule. How's yourself? Good. How 'bout a... Soda? Yeah. Buy you a drink? I don't drink with you, George. Frank, can't you let go of the past? No. I can't forget that a couple of friends of mine framed me. That was three years ago. You know what those three years were like, George? I heard. Couldn't get no work. I know, I heard. What else did you hear? You were drunk most of the time. No, I wasn't. I drank a lot but I never could get drunk. Okay. So, what do you want, Frank? Nothing. I don't want nothing from you or Chubby. (scoffing) There's nothing I can do about what happened. It's done. That's right. Tell you what, though. I'm riding a horse called Kazar in the third race Saturday. Bet him. Can't lose. (crickets chirping) ** Where you going? See you in the morning. You staying out all night? I got some business to take care of. With that waitress lady, huh? Go back to sleep. Have a good time. Thanks. (door closing) (Marie) You like it? Isn't it pretty? Isn't it pretty!?! It sure is, Marie. See, I painted it. I painted it myself. (FranK) You're kidding me. You climbed up there? (chuckling) Huh? 4-8. I'm gonna bet that tomorrow. Ah, Marie. You're a terrific-looking woman. You don't look no older than before I left. Yeah? Hmm... Skin's just as soft. You're just as pretty. Oh, come on. No, I mean it. You like the house, Frank? Hmm? It's a real nice place, Marie. Isn't it pretty? This house was only half of my dream. You were the rest of it. Say, Marie... ... how'd you like to make some... ... big money really fast? Huh? Lend me $2,000 and I guarantee I'll double it for you in a couple of days. Are you kidding? No, I got a sure winner on Saturday. Well, Frank, I don't have that kind of money. Well, uh... ... what happened to your savings? Well, I put it all into this house. All of it? Well, yeah. I mean, that's what I was saving for after all. Don't you remember? Well, you... got your house and you could borrow against it. Oh, Frank. No. No, you don't want me to risk my house. It ain't no risk. No, I-- I-- I saved all my life for this place. Ain't no risk, Marie. No. No, this place means more to me than... Hey, hey, Marie. There ain't no risk, I'm telling you. Oh, Frank, I want to trust you. I really do. But, I mean, eh, you're-- you're the-- the guy who went away and never called. I mean, after all. Never mind. I'll get the money somewhere else. (sighing) Okay, Frank. Okay, what? I'll get you the money. I'll get you the money. Oh, Marie, baby. Oh, Marie. ** (horse neighing) Good morning, honey. Where you going? Let's go get some breakfast. I'd rather eat with Gilford. (chuckling) ** Are you sure about this Kazar, honey? Oh, he can't lose, I'm telling you. Well, how do you know that? Well, now, look. Let me give you a lesson in handicapping. First thing you wanna do is look up the history of the horses' wins and losses in this column. Hey, Frank. Yeah? Can I see you a minute? Sure, Andy. Hold onto that, I'll be right back. What do you want, George? You placed your bet yet? No. Good. Bet Kircubbin. Huh. Kazar's the best horse in this race. Kircubbin's gonna win. You sure? Come here, Frank. Put this on it for me. That's how sure I am. This makes up for the past, don't it, Frank? We'll see. (man on PA) Horses are on the track now for the third race at six furloughs. Attention, Mr. Robert Bowers, Mr. Robert Bowers. Please report to the first aid. The horses are at the gate. That Kazar is a real beauty. The only other horse that holds a candle to him is number two, Kur-Coobin. Cubbin-- Kircubbin. Kircubbin, cubbin. (man on PA) They're entering the starting gate. (Marie) And Jo says Kazar just far out classes him. Mm-hmm. Did you bet? I bet. (man on PA) The flag is up. Please, God, just make me a rich woman. That's all I ask! (bell ringing) (man on PA) There they go. Kazar... Right there, right there! Dolly's Love is second. Lindsay Baby third. Kircubbin is fourth. Come on, Kazar! Come on, Kazar! Yeah! Come on, hang in there, baby! At the far turn it's Kazar in front by a neck. Dolly's Love in second by a half length. Kircubbin third by a head. Lindsay Baby is fourth. Then Tommy Tucker and... Aww! ... coming into the stretch. He sure knows his business. ... Kazar in front by a head. Dolly's Love is second by a neck. Kircubbin third. Now moving up strongly on the outside. Lindsay Baby and Tommy Tucker. Now it's Kazar in front of Kircubbin. Kazar on the inside. Six to one. Kazar... Come on, Kazar! Oh, yeah. Hey! Oh, hey... (man on PA) ... Kazar and Kircubbin. It's gonna be close. Kazar and Kircubbin and it ends! It was Kazar, wasn't it? In the chance of photo finish, please retain all mutual tickets... I don't know, we'll find out. ... until the results are declared official. It was Kazar, wasn't it!?! Oh my God, what... what if he didn't even win? Oh my God! Just take it easy, Marie. What do you mean? Can't you tell me whether he won or not? My God! I'm not sure! What do you mean, you're not sure?! Oh my God! What, did you have a lot of money on-- on this race? I had $2,000 on this race. $2,000? Yes! What? (man on PA) The result of the photo, number two Kircubbin is first. Number one, Kazar is second. Oh my God! My little house! (laughing) Hey, hey! You no-good bum! Why'd you have to come back into my life for? Stop it there! I was doing great without you! Marie! What are you carrying on for? What do you mean, what am I carrying on for?! Marie? Yeah. Uh-huh. Stop it, now, settle down. Oh, you settle down! Ow! I'm ruined! Your old man ruined me! You are, you're a bum! (laughing) Quit! Stop, stop! What? What does that say? Huh? Well, that's number two! That's Kir-coobin. Kircubbin. Yeah! Right, we won, we won! Well, why didn't you tell me that?! Well, you never let me tell you nothing! Oh, you... (laughing) Didn't I always tell you he was a genius with the horses? Huh? Oh, Frank! My God! (laughing) Hey, I don't understand something about the handicap. What? What is-- what is that all about? Well, there's handicapping, then there's tips. Did Andy give you a tip? Huh? Yeah, sort of. So, we won, we won. (Jo) So, what are you gonna do with the money, Frank? Yeah? Well, first off, I'm gonna pay Marie what she's got coming to her. That's $4,000. I'm gonna buy myself a washing machine first thing tomorrow. And then I'm gonna get you a present. A present? A horse. Gilford? Gilford. (chuckling) Gil... Oh, thank you! Yeah, yeah. Gilford! ** Hey, pal, give me one of those. Let's go. ** (crowing) (all cheering) Hey, hey! What did I tell you? My little girl wanted a horse, so I got her a horse. If my little girl wanted the moon, I'd get her the moon too. Hey, I'll settle for just the horse. (laughing) She's got her old man's sense of humor, don't she? Huh? I want to buy everybody in here drinks. Step up. You satisfied, Frank? More than satisfied, Chubby. So, when are you gonna say "thank you" to George? You won some money thanks to him, right? Thanks to him, my foot. Stay out of this, Marie. That's right, Chubby. What do you want, Chub? What are you trying to say? I'm saying that Frank owes my boy a thank you. Any objections to that? Thanks, George. (George) You're welcome, Frank. That's better. Well, what was that all about? What'd you thank him for? I would have spit in his eye. Hey, come on, forget it. Let's dance. Come on. That's too fast for me. I need something slow. Oh, you don't. I been on my feet all day. You're a good dancer, don't worry about it. Come on. Jo, play something slow, honey. For the old man. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let it go. ** ** Dance? How come you're here? I wanted to celebrate with you. Come on. You know how to dance like that? No, but we can fake it. Well, you're going the wrong way. Yeah, I know. (crickets chirping) If I couldn't have Gilford, I'm glad you do. Me too. (crickets chirping) (whispering) Frank. Frank. (train whistle blowing in the distance) Dad? Huh? Are you sober enough to talk? What's going on? I need to talk to someone. Oh. What time is it? Okay, shoot. Do you think Roy's too good for me? Huh? Roy. You know, he goes to college and he's rich. You been messing around with him? No! Then what's going on? Nothing's going on. Forget it, go back to sleep. No, I saw the way the two of you was dancing tonight. I said never mind. I don't want to talk about it anymore. Well, I do. I don't. Well, then what did you wake me up for? I didn't think you was sleeping. Well, you said you wanted to talk to somebody. Well, I do. Well, talk. It's not easy. You been fooling around with him, you better cut it out. You're too young for that. I don't believe this. And from now on, I don't think you and me ought to be sleeping in the same bed either. That's just fine. Where do you want me to sleep? You know... I think I made a big mistake. You living around a track like this. I love the track. What are you talking about? All I know is that you and me ought not be sleeping in the same bed! You just... stay on your side. This will be like the old days, Andy. I got me another champ. You gonna throw some of your big parties again, Frank? (chuckling) You bet. Bigger than ever. You'll see. You remember the time you hired the all-girl band for one of them? (laughing) Yeah. Remember the drummer? I remember the bass player. (both laughing) Yeah. Mind if I join you, Mr. Butler? Son, have you been messing around with my daughter? No, sir, I haven't. How old are you? 18-and-a-half. Well, don't mess around with my daughter. She's just a kid. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Go on, sit down. Thank you. (birds chirping) I can't live off no woman. I never have and I never will. (Marie) But you won't be living off me. You'll just be living with me. The house is too small. No, it's plenty big enough now. Jo will never go along with it. Well, let's ask her. She just lost her mama, for cryin' out loud. That's right, and she needs a real home. Doesn't she? (Frank clearing throat) Hey, that's terrific! So, what'd you think? I thought it was real good, honey. He felt real good in the turns too, huh? Yeah, that's the way to teach him. You just keep pulling his head back. Uh... (horse neighing) (clearing throat) Marie wants us to live in her house with her, Jo. What? You'll have a room all to yourself, honey. Uh, with a nice bed and-- it's hardly ever been used. I like it where we are. A horse van-- that's no place for a girl. I like it. You shouldn't be sleeping with your daddy. Neither should you. I'm not his daughter. And you're not his wife either. Well, well, that's a real old-fashioned attitude. Now, isn't that old-fashioned, Frank? If you want to live in her house, that's fine. Go ahead. But I'm staying in the van. Oh, please, honey, don't ruin it for me. I'm crazy about your daddy. I've been dreaming of living with him ever since I've known him. And now I got the place. I'll take real good care of the two of you. Honest to God I will. I'll make you real happy. (Marie) You know, we'll be like a-- like a real family. I told ya. ** I'll take her, son. She's just tryin' to do us a favor. I don't know why you gotta be nasty to her. She doesn't care about me. All she wants is you. I'm just part of the package. If you want Frank, you gotta take the kid too, right? Well, you got it all wrong! She wants to make a home for you, for cryin' out loud! You don't want it, okay. Seen my flask around anywhere? I threw it away. What? Look, if it means that much to you to move in with Marie, fine, we'll move in with Marie. How come you throw my flask away? Because I hate it. Don't bug me. ** (birds chirping) I got your room all ready for you, Jo. Well, I hope you like flowers. Yeah. I used to help my mom plant flowers during the spring. I planted all of these myself. Maybe next time I plant, you can help me. Why don't you come inside? I'll show you your room. Let me get the door for you. Now, uh, your room is right up the stairs, honey, on your right. So-- so where you gonna sleep? He'll sleep with me. Where do you think he'll sleep? Come on. You like it? It's great. You mean it? Yeah. It's great. I, uh, I made these curtains myself, see? Yeah, they're nice. Now, if there's anything that you want to change or move around or anything, then you just-- you just feel free because this is your room. Thanks, Marie. Thank you, honey. Well, it doesn't matter. I want to give the horse another week. (humming) He don't need another week. Roy says he needs George Gardner. I'm his trainer. I ride him. I know him better. Oh, you know him better, do you? It's my horse. Excuse me, honey. Oh. Help Marie. It's okay, Frank. Help Marie clear the table. Why don't you help her? It's okay, I don't need any help. Help her, I said! You help her! I don't want any help. I'm a waitress and this is just second nature to me. No, I want her to get up off her fanny and help out. That's what kids do in a family. Lay off her, Frank. What? Just lay off her. Listen, I'm the father. She does what I tell her to do. Look, I want her to be happy living here. I want her to like me. So, you just get off her back. Now, I'll clear the table myself and I'll do the dishes myself. You two just keep on arguing about Gilford. * When whippoorwills call * And evening is nigh * * I hurry to * My blue heaven * A turn to the right * * A little bright light * * Will lead you to * My blue heaven * You'll see a smiling face * * A fireplace, a cozy room * (laughing) * A little nest * That's nestled where * * The roses bloom * Just Molly and me * * Just Molly and me * And the baby makes three * * How happy in * My blue heaven * Heaven * Hey, Jo. Hi. Can I talk to you guys for a minute? It's Frank's kid. Yeah, I know. I want you to ride Gilford in the seventh race on Saturday. Oh, yeah? How come your old man sends you to do his negotiating? My old man and I are partners. Well, uh, tell him we paid him what we owe him. We don't owe him nothing else. What do you mean? I don't want to ride your horse. How come? (scoffing) Because I don't like him. He's a good horse. I don't like him. Oh. Tell your old man that Chubby said... "We did him a favor and the slate is clean." What favor? You think George lost that race by accident? I don't know what you're talking about. Just tell him what I said. He'll understand. You're talking about the Kazar race, huh? Just tell him. (birds chirping) Where you been, honey? Come on, we got a lot of work to do. I've been talking to George and Chubby. Oh, yeah? Yeah. George says it was no accident that Kazar lost that race. He told you that? Yeah, he told me that. Let's get something straight. George gave me a tip, that's all. He told me to bet Kircubbin over Kazar. Got it? You telling me the truth? Wait a minute. Are you? Where do you get off calling me a liar? Did I ever lie to you? Didn't I give you a horse? Ain't we got ourselves a nice home? What's the matter with you? Mama always taught me to be honest. She wouldn't stand for anything else, and I bet you that's the main reason she kicked you out. 'Cause she found out you were such a cheat. That's not so! I just wanted to give you Gilford. That's all. So, you stole him for me, huh? I wanted to make up for all those years when I wasn't with you. I wanted to show you I was a winner. A winner? That's very funny. How can a drunk be a winner? What?! Don't touch me! (horse neighing) ** Don't! Stop! (horse neighing) Gilford, stop! Arthur, come! (horse neighing) Help him, help him! Someone get an ambulance! Someone get an ambulance! Dad! He's still breathing. Mrs. Butler? So to speak. And I'm his daughter. He's in the recovery room. We won't know the results of the surgery for a while. Maybe a week or so. His vital signs are all good. Did you find anything, Doctor? We relieved the pressure on the brain and removed a blood clot. We won't know if there's been significant brain damage until he regains consciousness. Well, when can we see him? Maybe tomorrow. Thank you. It's gonna be okay. I know Frank. Is the operation over? Mm-hmm. It's all my fault. Oh, it's not your fault, honey. It's the horse's fault. Come on, let's get out of here. We can't see him 'til tomorrow, huh? Okay, well let's get out of here. Come on, Marie. No, you go on. I'm gonna just stay here just in case. Come on, Marie. Just go on without me, huh? Okay. (birds chirping) Have you seen Gilford? Is he okay? There's a problem with Gilford, Jo. What do you mean? (sighing) They're saying he's a rogue horse. That's crazy. Now, it was my fault. I yelled. Gilford got a little scared. He jumped and it was an accident. Yeah, well, you better talk to the vet. (Jo) He's not a rogue. You gotta believe me. I know that horse. The horse has a history, Jo. His last owner said he was wild. I yelled, he got scared. Now, you can't kill him for that. How's your father doing? Not so good. Because of the horse, right? My old man believes in that horse. He wouldn't want you to put him to sleep. He's been waiting for a winner for a long time. I was gonna enter Gilford in the seventh race on Saturday. At least let him race one more time before you make any final decisions. Please. Okay. Thanks. (machine whirring) ** (sniffling) Um, I'm just sure... he's not ready to pack it in yet. He's got too much life left in him. He looks so peaceful lying there. Yeah. He doesn't look that much different from when I first met him. His-- his beard's a little grayer, though. I remember when he, uh, walked into the diner and... and he ordered the most expensive entrée on the menu. He acted like he was a king. (laughing) And then... when it came time to pay his bill, he didn't have any money. Well, it didn't matter because he was Frank Butler. He's the best. So, the bosses trusted him for the money. Oh, he used to talk about you all the time. He didn't know anything about you but he was sure you were special. Most people don't know how loving Frank can be. Oh, God, I hope he don't die. I ain't nearly had enough of him yet. No. Not nearly. Hey, Stanley? Hi, Jo. Hi. I was wondering if Zack could race Gilford in the seventh race on Saturday? Saturday? Yeah. It's a little late to start booking for Saturday, isn't it, kid? Yeah, well, you know how things are. We'll book that race. It's a pretty big one. Yeah. Do you know if Lefty's in that race? Hey, Luther. Your boy riding seventh on Saturday? You mean the big one? Yeah. Yeah, we're riding. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Hey, Shimmy. How's your old man, kid? Same. Hey, do you know if Rooster's riding in the seventh race on Saturday? Rooster is racing out at Glen Meadows for the next couple of weeks. Okay, thanks. ** (sighing) This is my old man's special recipe, this poultice. I know. You do? He told me. Oh. There's one thing about your old man. (chuckling) He's not modest. Yeah. That's one of the things I like best about him. Stop staring. I can't help it. Well, then go back to work. I'd rather stay with you. You know, maybe you shouldn't come around for a while. I mean, until after the race. 'Cause I'm not getting any work done. I'm leaving for school Wednesday. I don't know when I'm gonna see you again. In that case, you can stay. (man on PA) Jo Butler to the gate. Jo Butler come to the gate, please. Come on, I'll drive you. The hospital called. They want Jo as quick as she can make it. Did they say why? Nope. (tires screeching) I didn't know if they reached you. What happened? Didn't they tell you? No, is he dead? Dead? No, he woke up! When? Well, he was awake when I got here. He isn't talking yet. But he seems to know everything that's going on. Jo, didn't I tell you? Everything is gonna be all right. Hi, Dad. Jo. Did you see that? Didn't I tell you? He knows what's going on. He's gonna be fine. (whispering) Welcome back. You feeling better? You feeling okay? The doctor said he should get plenty of rest. You know, we shouldn't overdo talking to him today. Yeah, that's right. We sure did miss you. That's putting it mildly. Gilford. Gilford's just fine. I wanted to enter him in the big race on Saturday but I can't find a jockey. I've talked to everybody. I've talked to Zack, I've talked to Rooster. There's no one who'll do it. You ride him. What? You ride him. What are you talking about? I don't have a license. I'm not a jockey, I can't do that. You are Gilford's, Jo... Don't tax yourself, sweetie. Come on. (groaning) Don't talk about it anymore, Jo. Now, that horse has done enough damage already. (whispering) Okay. We'll let him get some rest now. We'll see you tomorrow, Dad. (grunting) You ride Gilford, Jo. I'm not a jockey. (groaning) (woman) Please go. He shouldn't have company now. He's much too weak. (air pumping) So, what do you think of George Gardner? I hate his guts. How come? Don't you know? No. Didn't your daddy ever tell ya? Well, I asked him once but he wouldn't say. Yeah, well, he probably doesn't want you to know. Well, Marie, I really need to know. And you're the only one that can tell me. Well, honey, if he doesn't want you to know, then I'm not telling you. But-- but it's real important that I know. I have to know. You've gotta tell me. George... and Chubby, they drugged a horse that your old man was training. You know, they-- they-- they speeded him up, you know? And the horse, he won a big race. But then the-- the commission they ran some tests on the horse and they found out about the drug and, uh, George and Chubby denied responsibility and they framed Frank. Frank did a real good job defending himself but then Chubby says to the steward, "Are you gonna believe a drunk?" And the steward, he listened to him. So, they suspended Frank for three years. He was like a lost soul. He just disappeared. I tell you, I... I'll never speak to either one of those guys again for as long as I live. Was he a drunk? No. He always liked to drink, like a lot of guys, but he was never a drunk. Yeah. Thanks for telling me. Well, I figure it's better you-- you know the truth. I don't want you hearing a different story from somebody else. Thanks, Marie. (Roy) When are you gonna tell him? (Jo) I don't know yet. Well, when are you gonna know? When I'm talking to him. Oh. I'll be out in a few minutes. Right. How's the old man doing, kid? Not so good. Keeping my fingers crossed for him. (man) We're all rootin' for him, Jo. I want to ride Gilford in the seventh race on Saturday and I want to ride him in your name. Have you popped your cork, kid? Look, if you don't agree to it, I'm gonna go to the track official and I'm gonna tell him what happened with Kazar. Your old man could get in a lot of trouble for that too. Look, my old man is lying in a hospital bed right now and he might not be able to work ever again. What more can they do to him? You stand to lose a lot, though. Huh, George? How 'bout if I ride Gilford? Uh-uh. I'm the one who has to ride him. You could get into a lot of trouble if they find out. That's a chance I have to take. Because I owe it to him. And so do you. I paid him back. You could never pay him for what you took from him. What do I get for doing this? Whatever piece of the action we get... you get. And it's like right before we come out of the turn I can feel him. He wants to go for it. Uh-huh. Let him. Yeah? Yeah, let him. You're probably reading him right. Okay. Time to go, Jo. Oh, what are you talking about? Come on. She can stay as long as she wants. (chuckling) Come on. Kiss Daddy goodbye. It's time for you to rest, Mr. Butler. Who says? Doctor. Too much excitement. That's why you're having headaches. Mmm... Headaches? It's nothing. Come on, say goodbye. Come on, give me a kiss. (whispering) Goodbye. (whispering) Bring me my flask. That's not funny. Goodbye. Don't worry about nothing. You hear? (sighing) It's after 2:00, honey. We need to get some sleep. I can't sleep. Well, your daddy said you should get plenty of rest before the race. I can't sleep! So, what do you want me to do?! Well, you don't have to yell at me. Well, then stop nagging me. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay. I guess I'm a little scared about the race tomorrow. Sure. That's what I think too. I keep going over everything in my head. Over and over. I know what you mean. That happens to me all the time. (sighing) Sometimes I even wake up in the middle of the night, you know, at 5:00 in the morning or so... and my mind's going over and over all the problems I ever had in my life. I'm worried about him. I know, honey, me too. (whispering) I gotta win for him. And you will. You will. I'm even gonna bet on you. (chuckling) Want me to stay with you for a while? Huh? While you fall asleep. Don't have to. Yeah, I know I don't have to. But I'll be happy to do it if you want me to 'cause I know-- I know what it's like to be so scared you can't sleep. You're still a baby, for cryin' out loud. You still need a mother. So, let me be your mother. What's the big deal? (humming lullaby) ** Jo's here, sweetie. Huh. (whispering) The headaches are worse, honey, and, uh, they don't know if they can operate again. Hi. I got something I want to tell you. Shoot. I'm not sure if I can say it right. I got this feeling for you that I've never had before in my life. It's, uh... ... it's a real special feeling. I've never had it for anyone else. It's about being a father. I like everything you do, Jo. You're a winner. I'm proud you're my daughter. I'm thankful you came into my life. Yeah, me too. How's Gilford? (crying) The vet says he's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Well, you remember to talk to him when he's comin' out of the turns. Yeah, yeah, I will. When's the-- what time's the race? In about an hour. Mmm... Well, you better get going. Yeah. You don't wanna be late, you know. Yeah, okay. Goodbye, Jo. Goodbye. Good luck. I love you. I love you too, sweet honey. (birds chirping) You the trainer? Right. (horse neighing) Easy, boy, easy, boy. Nothing to be afraid of. Good luck, Jo. How you doing? Scared. Here. There's something else I brought you. For good luck. Thanks. It's... it's beautiful. (sighing) I'm shaking. I've got total confidence in you, Jo. Thanks. Bye. Go. (static blaring) (man on radio) The day is important for another reason. Here we go. ... in the race, Gilford is being ridden by George Gardner. The race reunites Gardner with Gilford's trainer and owner... Hey. ... Frank Butler. That's Gilford he's talking about, Frank. ... as a team, Gardner and Butler came before the racing commission on charges of drugging a horse. Butler alone was found guilty of the charge and suspended from racing for three years. Butler's partner is his 16-year-old daughter Joanna...
