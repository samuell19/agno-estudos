Tonight is one of those nights I wish I had a lot of money. - For what? - To make a movie. - What would you film? - A story about young guys. - About guys like us. - How boring. Do you think so? The Old Young People - What are we gonna do tonight? - Let's go to the cinema. Again? There's nothing on. Let's stay here at Carlos Hugo's. They must be playing canasta. The jack that I was missing. 120. I lay. Good, Mecha. - Go see who it is, Coca. - Okay, ma'am. Hello boys . - Good night, ma'am. - Goodnight. Carlitos is waiting for you in his room. - Hello. - Hello. What are we gonna do? Invite us to play canasta. You joke. They go exactly 193 consecutive nights of canasta in this house. Everything is done depending on the canasta. Now I understand why the old man does not return from Europe. Poor dad. Alone and in Paris. - Whiskey? - No. Get dressed, we're going to the movies. - What's on? - Nothing. Let's have some air. This city is death. - What theater are we going to? - To any one. - Don't catch a cold, Carlitos. - No, mom. - Another red 3. 800. - But you're incredible, Mecha. Stop. Do you still want to go to the movies? Well... we might not go. - Let me speak first. - Come on. Do I get off too? No, wait for us on the corner. In half a block, I bring you all three. These girls won't believe us so easily. Believe us what? That we're good guys. The truth is that we're not very good. Look, if we were half as good as they are cute... how good we would be. Thanks for starting to cooperate. Yes, because it was cold... Look, the girl on the side doesn't think we're good guys. Too bad, she could be very cute but I would like to see her smile. Smile, the bird comes out. - Roberto, nice to meet you. - Ricardo, delighted. Hello, nice to meet you. This is Carlos Hugo. Marilú, Beatriz, Doris. Pleasure. - Good. What do we do? - We get into the jeep and decide? We never get on unknown people's cars. But you already know us, we already introduce ourselves. What would we do? We could go dancing. Where? I don’t know. To Olivos. Anywhere. Doris lives in Liniers. Do you take her after? Yes. All the girls I go out with live further away from Flores. OK let's go? Well, we never really go to discos. - Good evening, Miss Beatriz. - Good evening. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Me too. When chicks go together to the restroom they can return with any news. Get ready for the little swap. How clever, yours is worth nothing. Let's see what happens when they come back. I don't know why but you're always lucky. It's not luck. I inspire maternal instincts. The Actor's Studio airs are working well this year. Be careful, they are coming back. - How was the meeting? - What meeting? Let's dance? I want to dance with you. - You dance badly. - I didn't have time to learn. Did you have so much to do? What did you do? I learned to kiss. - Can I take an exam? - Of course. You don't need to know how to dance. Let's go to your yacht. Shut up, my head hurts. Bye. - Are you tired? - Not. Not tired. I have a headache. Let's go to take a walk along the boardwalk. OK let's go. The light bothers me. - How was she? - Who? What do you mean who? Beatriz, you moron. It was okay I guess. What's wrong? I have a headache. I'm bored, I don't know. I'm bored too. I'm tired of women that I don't care about. You're crazy. Not crazy. Old. Long live old age. - What day is today? - Saturday. What if we go to Mar del Plata? - Without sleeping? - Yes, right now. - And your Roman Law? - Whatever. I didn't study, anyway. It's been three years that I skip the exam. My mom thinks I'm in third year. She's gonna be happy next week. I'm gonna tell her that I passed to fourth. You have to be back on Monday. I can arrive at night. I have to take care of the agency program. - The fashion one? - Yes. And when your mom finds out that you're not in fourth year? Just live the present. Do like the boys in foreign movies. They spend their lives saying that two wars made them like this. - At least they have the wars. - What are you saying? Are you crazy? At least they can use wars to justify themselves. But we... what can we use? To justify what? To justify. Let's use Perón. It's the most comfortable and he's quite responsible. Are we going to Mar del Plata or not? Yes. Shall we change and get out? What a hellish wind. It's the only way not to fall asleep. It's a masochistic trip, man. What did you bring in that package? Snacks and sandwiches. Remains of the canasta. Here. This is caviar. Nice title for a movie. Caviar in the Shanty Town. Talk to me, otherwise I fall asleep. I can drive when you get tired. No, if we talk I'm fine. Let's talk. Tell me one thing. If you could film whatever you wanted... what would you film? - A movie about young people. - How? About people as similar as possible to us. Do you think We're important? Is there so much to say about us? We're very important, man. This country depends on us. Poor country. - Fill the tank, sir? - Yes, fill it up. What do you think of Beatriz for a role? Beatriz? I don't know, I didn't read the script. The script is about chicks like Beatriz and guys like us. - All newcomers? - The most possible. I would love to make a star. Take any chick, teach her to eat soup in silence... dress her up, and then make the whole world fall in love with her. Can you imagine? Millions of guys crazy for a woman you created. Why don't you tell me more about the movie, Vadim? The theme is loneliness, our absurd relationships. The thing is we don't love anyone. There you go. Who are we gonna love? Take last night's chicks. Yet they have more... in common with us that any classy little girl. The classy girls have dough, and without the chance... of love, that's what you have to look for. Okay, I'm on that too. And it makes me very angry. What? What were you talking about? Women. How do you want yours to be? Virgin. He means it. It's important to him. Nice character for your movie. Normal. For the audience, you and me would be the mad ones. Well. Long live the madness. Too bad there are no chicks in winter. Let's go to the beach to see what's up? Yes, we can find a hotel afterwards. I'm dead. You're in worse shape than Moacir. - Are we gonna find a hotel? - OK. Then we go for a walk. Looking for natives? Natives or stragglers. The winter is crazy. The whole house for us. For us and Gertrudis. Poor Gertrudis. Seventeen years in this house. Her only obsession is to protect our virtue. Why poor Gertrudis? Poor Gertrudis. The cigarettes, Miss María Cristina. Thank you, honey. We're going for a walk! Wrap up! Come on, now. You can't drive in peace on the sidewalk anymore. You can drive in peace. But be careful around the corner. There's a pothole. That girl is worth knowing. We've run out of water! Can you lend us a watering can? In this house we drink sulfuric acid. I can bath in sulfuric acid for you. So be it, let them bathe. Wait! I'll get you the water! What a stupid joke. If we just were on summer. Calm down, those chicks are worth a shower. They have a sense of humor, huh. Well, we already did our show. Can we sit down? - It seems fair to me. - What if we all go to the beach? - Will you forgive us for the shower? - Yes. - Let's go? - Let's go. We're gonna get the swimsuits in case there's sun. Did you say swimsuits? That's antique. We practiced nudism for years. Oh, we too. But today is very cold. Our advantage! Sonia, what are you doing? Game for them. 5 to 4. What's wrong? Dizziness Those dizziness are dangerous. Hell no! Well, enough with the hoop. Sit down so you get better. - You lost by abandonment. - No way. Go put your clothes on. OK, daddy. They are alright. Hey silly. Did you see how nice they are? Yes, they are very nice. We have to hurry. In Buenos Aires we won't see them anymore. We have tonight and tomorrow for something to happen. There's nothing better than freeze to death in Mar del Plata. Thank you. Do you like the sea, Sonia? Yes. Does it make you sad? If I'm happy, it makes me happier. If I'm sad, it makes me sadder. I guess you have nothing to do with your way of life. What do you know about my way of life? Nothing. So? You have nothing to do with it anyway. You don't have anything to do with Ricardo either. Why are you friends with him? He's a nice guy. And is that reason enough? No. You see. All positions are fake. What are you doing in Mar del Plata in winter? Just hanging around. How long have you been hanging around? Ten days. Are you staying for long? Some weeks. Until our families make us go back. It seems unbelievable, but you're quite shy. Quite. Me too. It also seems unbelievable. Do you want to dance? OK. They're happy. Me too. - Hello. - Hello. Stop it. Let's take a walk? OK let's go. Do you like TV? The shows are so bad. You earn a lot of money. Yes. They say that the announcers earn more than 100,000 per month. I work in TV. Do you want to be an announcer? OK. it's easy? If an influential guy helps you, yes. And you're an influential guy? Quite. And what do I have to do? Put yourself in my hands. - Totally? - Well... almost totally. - You're a brute. - I really like you. You're also in a hurry. Let's go back. I was eager to take a hot bath. Tonight I forgot about Quique. Poor Quique. Tonight he got cuckolded. Where could he be? With a girl from the Virginia Institute of Technology. Thrown between a Cadillac and an oil well. Do you mind? Today I don't mind anything. Rulo must be in Olivos consoling himself because I'm not there. I hope he's very happy. I don't know why you criticize me for hanging with guys. One night is enough for you to forget the love of your life. I go out with Coco and a thousand other guys. And I'm gonna marry Coco. I'm also gonna marry Quique. Too many things happened. Every guy care. I don't know, these are very special. You're special. They are guys like any other. Who knows if Chiche is not right. She's right. Ricardo is like her and they matched. I never felt more than a woman as tonight. Do you want to smoke? No. OK, give me. Have a light? Do you want? No, I'm fine. Never felt like you need a guy to reassure you? I do not know how to explain it to you. Yes, I know. Who reassures you. And not reassure you. All at the same time. With Carlos Hugo it's different. He's a disoriented boy. He's the first person that I find more disoriented than me. I feel like he needs me. And that almost makes me need him. Look at you. Sonia García Huergo del Solar and María Cristina... Arocena Montayo meet two blue princes in the jeep. They kiss them, wake up to life and think they are in love. Shocking. You're right. And they also need each other. I congratulate you. I don't want to think today. I do not feel good at all. - What do you mean? - Physically, I mean. Let's sleep. Envido. Real envido. Falta envido. Accept. How much do you have? You first. 25. You beat me. How much did you have? - What do you care? - Hello. - And Sonia? - She felt bad, she went to the doctor. Let's go to talk a walk around the breakwater. Let's go. What's the problem with Sonia? Don't worry. She's always scared by everything. She had an appointment with the doctor at 9. She must be on her way here by now. Look at those fishes. They're alive but they're dead. They're alive. They're gonna die. If you throw them in the water now, they die anyway. That is why they're alive but they're dead. It's almost like being old. Almost. We're old. You're less old. I'm almost like those fish. Do you have a boyfriend? What is that about? I don't know, it occurred to me. You must have. Yes, I have. Do you love him? So many difficult questions. Maybe he doesn't care if you love him. He cares. Maybe they'll live. Come on! Who wants to play! So we're two against two. You play. I watch. Hello, honey. What's wrong? I do not want anyone to know it. For two months nothing will be noticed. I'm going back to Buenos Aires and spend them with Roberto. Then, when Quique returns, I will marry him. But honey, they're gonna see you in Buenos Aires and you're not gonna be home. And Quique won't marry you. They won't see me. I'll stay inside. I don't know. I don't care. Quique will marry me. It's his. You're crazy. But I'd do the same. Cheer up. Here they come. When's your funeral? In 394 years. What are you planning to do until then? Cook ravioli for you. Sew your clothes. And sleep with you. We're gonna hire a maid and a cook so we don't waste time. How disgusting people who get cuddly in the morning. Let him. He says that out of envy. You spent your life talking about the woman of your dreams (...) besides they're crazy. You can't be without sleep. What were we looking for? How was the woman of our dreams? We were looking not to be alone. When you get locked in an asylum you're gonna be alone. Here they come. Honey. - I'm going back to Buenos Aires with you. - OK, excellent. Take me to live with you. Yes, and I'll take the breakfast to bed every day for you. - No, I'll take it to you. - OK. - Wanna go to the boardwalk? - What? I want to get on the sea lion statue and kiss you there. Let everyone see us. And take us a very cheesy picture, like the ones that my maid takes with her boyfriend. - What's wrong? - I have a craving. - Are you coming on Friday? - Yes. Rulo comes on Saturday. Yes, I know. Bye. Good luck. I'm upset. I didn't have time to seduce you. Better. Catch the following episode next week. Will the girl fall into the hands of the villain? If she doesn't fall, the villain eats the jeep. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Let's go, I'll be late for TV. See you on Friday. Bye. Bye. Three minutes to go and we're on. Perfect. - Let the signs fall slowly. - Yes, yes. You do the signs, then focus on Sarita with 90. Get ready, we're on. Ready we go! Start with 2! Attention! Come on! In the air! Give me 50, 2. Good. Good, we're on. No, I don't know which sign goes. No, there's no one from the agency. No, Ricardo did not arrive. What do I open with? - With the stockings. - Sign 1528 in the air. Sound! Announcer! The following program is an Omega Advertising production. Tell Carlos to slowly drop the signs on camera 1. I go with camera 2. 2 on the air! Focus on the models, 2. Good, 2. In the air with 1. Let the signs fall. Presents Styles and models Overprint 1 and 2. Cameras: Set design: Assistant direction: Direction: Take out 1, 2 left alone. Very good 2. - I'm going to the studio. - Be careful not (...)! Go. 1 on air! Today Sarita wears a tight design made... by our couturier in black guipure lace... on a natural soie sauvage background. The cultured pearl bracelet is a model... - And Roberto? - They left. What a rush. Hello, honey. Let's see what Hilda is wearing, who's already moving ethereally to the front. White chiffon cocktail dress... What a nice place. I couldn't stand that studio anymore. Don't put music. What? It's my own language. How can I learn it? I don't wanna leave this bed ever. Don't you think it's an important bed? Very important. It's unbelievable. When did we meet? Like a thousand years ago. Two days. Absurd. What am I doing in your bed? Don't think. But every time I think I'm more certain that I love you. Your luggage, honey. Can't we come in? Who was it? Carlos Hugo and Ricardo. We've left our things in the jeep. And this camera? I started filming something. - Do you love her? - A lot. Then I love her too. What did you think, moron? That we were gonna sleep? You're the first woman in the world who looks cute in the morning. I'm gonna conquer the world. - What do you want it for? - To bring it to you. Gertrudis! The doorbell! I'm coming, Miss! Hi. Yes, Miss. Hello? Carlos Hugo? How are you? Good, excellent. Are Sonia and Roberto coming? Oh, how lucky. Did you take your exam? Sounds good to me. Well, I wait for you. When? On Friday. Great. Say hello to Sonia. Yes. Bye. Bye. They brought this telegram, Miss. Are they coming? Yes. What are you gonna do with Rulo? - What is that? - A telegram from Quique. He arrives by plane in Buenos Aires on Sunday. We must tell Sonia. No. Let her have these days. - I bought these oranges today. - Don't buy them anymore. Do you wear Pecado bras? Yes. Use some other brand. How did it go today with the movie? They told me "you're too young and rebel". "At your age I was like you". "You have to compromise", and other stupid things. You're gonna do it. I'm sure. How? ...if I were a hundred years old. They always tell me "you're very young, you have all your life ahead of you". And the life (...) and the possibilities of young people. Those who keep our things from being known. Those who step on all the young people who have something to say and destroy them. Those who cling tooth and nail to defend their interests. We're a transition generation. They don't let us do or say things. All we have left is help our children say them. By then, today's old men will be dead. The old one will be yourself. Won't you cling just the same? You'll be with me. You're gonna be my wife. And you won't let me be the same. Miss, how do you suppose I can paint you if you don't take off that garment? Forgive me, it's that Pecado brassieres are so comfortable... that you don't even realize you're wearing them. Cut! Well, that works for me. How did it go? Was I OK? Yes, you looked like Greta Garbo. Don't be stupid. Can't be serious with you. - Carlos Hugo called today. - Oh yeah? And what does he say? He wanted to arrange a trip for Mar del Plata, for the weekend. Wanna go? Yes, I have to. Why? Don't you want yo go? Yes. What an awful yes! I got used to being alone with you. Here. This is like an island of my own. Outside are the people and the Pecado bras. Let's relocate the island. Nothing else. Let's get married now, Sonia. What for, if it's the same? Generally, this dialogue is the other way around. If I'm your woman. So let's get married. - No. - Why? 12 o'clock, Miss. What day is today? Friday. It's gonna be a busy weekend. I'm gonna have to make up my mind. What's wrong? I'm very, very coward. That's why I'm going to stay with Rulo. That's very good. He's your boyfriend. You will have a position, you will have safety. Safety... That is why I'm very coward. Carlos Hugo needs so much help... Shut up! Rulo is very handsome. You have to know that everyone envies you. Oh, honey. Sometimes I envy you. They arrived! Coco! What are you doing here? You were the only one we did not expect. What a nice reception. Come in. Sit down, my love. No, you come with me. We gotta go to the station. What for? Rulo is coming. I was not gonna come. I took Rulo to the train station after the game. He scored two tries. When the train left, I thought it would be a great joke and I came... in the car to arrive before him and look for him here at the station. Can you imagine his face? Shall the three of us go and pick him up? No, I have a fever, you know? Well, I'll be back in an hour. Bye. Let's go for a walk, I don't want to stay home. Why? Hi. How are you? Something's fishy. Why? I don’t know. María Cristina is acting weird. It's the shock. You are really a ladies' man this year. Honey. Let's go for a walk. A walk? We spent all night in the jeep! Let's go see the sunrise in Barranca de los Lobos. Ricardo and Chiche went inside. I'll let them know. Excuse me. We're going for a walk. Do you wait for us? Don't you invite us? Are you going? And what do I say? What you want. Oh, well... What's this? Who's Quique? Sonia's boyfriend. Why did you ask Sonia "and what do I say?" Because of Gertrudis. Don't lie to me. Who do you have to tell? Kiss me. Who. To Rulo and Coco. Who are they? María Cristina's boyfriend. And mine. All three of you are little cheaters, huh. When do they come? Kiss me. When are Rulito and Coquito arriving? In 40 minutes. Let's go to your room. What time is it? We have to get dressed. I disappear. Are you gonna call me in Buenos Aires? And your little boyfriend? I'm gonna marry him. I don't sleep with him. I'll call you. You like me? Yes. Bye. Bye. Hi. Hi. What's wrong? And the others? In Barranca de los Lobos. And your wife? We have to run away. There's a boyfriend's invasion. What? The little girls' boyfriends are coming. What a mistake I made. You asked for it. No, the cards were badly shuffled. These chicks have them marked. You have to cheat better than them. You don't understand. The cheating doesn't interest me. If you cheated, you would've won. Never mind. I swear I don't understand you. I will tell him. Even if it's the last thing I do in the world. I'm gonna tell him. Roberto. I'm pregnant. It's not yours. it's not yours. It's not yours. Why won't it be yours? I love you, Sonia. I want to die. Sonia... I want you to marry me. Don't ask me why, Roberto. But I'm gonna leave you. Why? Don't ask me why, I beg you. Why? There are two ways. What? I was talking to myself. And what were you saying? That there are two ways. For what? For people like you... and like me. Which are? Be brave... or be a coward. I'm a coward. And so? Cowards run away. I knew this couldn't last. THE END
