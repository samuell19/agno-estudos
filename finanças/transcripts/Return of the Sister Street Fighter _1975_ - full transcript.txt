Sho, it's been a long time. Sorry for calling you out here. Hello. Oh, Rika, you're here too? Actually, cousin Shurei has disappeared. Shurei? And do you have any clues? I have a favor to ask in this regard. It seems this incident was caused by a certain large Japanese organization that's pulling the strings. Since I'm a detective, my face is too well known. Fortunately, you're a woman. Can you go to Japan for me and find out about Shurei? What, go to Japan? Before her disappearance, Shurei met with a certain woman. A certain woman? Suzy Wong is her name. She's Shurei's friend. According to our information, she's now working in a club called the Empire, in Yokohama. The Empire in Yokohama? Shurei's sister Reika is also in Yokohama. If you go to Yokohama and see Suzy, you should be able to find out something. I understand. I'll do everything I can. Inside is a file on the organization. Give me that bag. What? Uncle! Sho... Sho! Koryu... Koryu... Rika. Take care of Rika. Shurei is... Rika's irreplaceable mother. For Rika's sake... ...find Shurei. Please! Sho! Be careful... Sho! Uncle! Uncle! Rika! YOKOHAMA Rika, there's Yokohama. Wonderful! - That's Koryu. - Right. Koryu! Get her! Rika! Deal with her! Rika! - Koryu! - Michi! - Long time no see. - Don't waste time! Rika, get back! Thank you very much. Auntie! Rika! Rika, good to see you. How do you do? I am Koryu. - Sho entrusted Rika to me. - Oh, I see. This is Michi from Yokohama. We became friends at a martial arts tournament. - How do you do? - Hello. Please come in. This way. - Here you go, Rika. - Thank you! To think that my sister is here in Yokohama. If she's really here, why doesn't she get in touch with me? We were very close siblings. I wondered how she was doing. Auntie, where's my mother? Rika, it's alright. I'll definitely find your mother. Me too. I will do everything I can to help. Thank you so much. Koryu, you can stay in this house as long as you like. Thank you. Would you like a flower? You're Suzy, right? Where's Shurei? It was you who took her out of Hong Kong, right? Please talk to me. Rika is all alone, waiting for Shurei's return. I told Shurei there was good work to be had in Japan. We were brought to this awful place. Is Shurei here too? She alone was taken to a different place. A different place? She's been made the boss's mistress. The boss? Who's that? Ryu-Mei Oh, the shadow ruler of Yokohama's Chinatown. Ryu-Mei Oh? Hey, Suzy! Who the hell are you? You're the flowerseller. What are you doing in here? You bitch! Come on, quick! Shit! You little... You're Koryu! Run! Stop! I haven't employed you all this long, just for the sake of giving you free meals! Someone has started a fight with our organization. It's Koryu Lee, the lady dragon! She's played havoc with these weaklings here, and she's after the secrets of our organization. "Kill all pests!" That's my philosophy. What I need now are thoroughly trained professionals! We're going to stage a death match to select those professionals. The ones who win this match will be allowed to serve as my four best fighters. For the losers... death! Bastard! Now drink! My wealth is limitless. If you work hard enough, you will have a chance to earn a share of that wealth. Understood? What are you doing, you bastard? So these are the four fighters you've chosen? If these are the best you can do, it'll damage Ryu-Mei Oh's fine reputation. Who are you? How long have you been working in this racket? If you don't know Takeshi Kurosaki, you're small-time. So, you're the hell-bent Kurosaki? You're the boss, alright. You're sharp. How about it? Do you want to buy my skill? What insulting nonsense! Shall I take you on? In any case, one of you has to die or there's no room for me. What? Wanna go for it? That's fine with me. If we do, the best four will become only one and that'll be me. You're a funny one! Very well... ...I'll choose your opponent. That settles it. Ryu-Mei Oh, I'd like to offer you my help. If I kill the lady dragon myself, how much will you give me? Hold it, there are four of us. We won't let you do this alone. Shut up! - I'm the only one who can kill Koryu. - What? Enough! Very well... You decide among the four of you who will kill the lady dragon. I'll pay the one who kills her 10 million yen! Shurei, what's the matter? Now that you know your daughter is in Yokohama, you're not in the mood? Don't worry. As long as you keep doing your duty, we won't touch your daughter. You have pharmaceutical knowledge, and there aren't that many women with a body like yours. That's everything. We're relying on you. Right. We're off! Hey. Koryu, I want to see my mommy soon. Rika, you will see her soon. I'll be happy then. When I see my mother, I'm going to ask her to buy me lots and lots of ice cream. You're a little pig, aren't you? Where's your mother? What's the matter? My mother died many, many years ago. Cheer up, Koryu! I'll be your friend forever and ever. Thank you. What a waste! Rika. Auntie, Koryu bought this doll for me. The park is beautiful. Don't drop it, OK? Hey, be careful! Boss, the preparations are complete. Shurei, begin your work. Shurei? Koryu, where's my mommy? Isn't it grand, dissolving gold in hydrochloric and nitric acid, and then smuggling it in? The only thing you can rely on in this world is gold. Whether it's capitalism... ...or communism... ...neither can win against gold. I've divided my wealth between both camps. Whichever side wins, the one who controls the world from the shadows will be me. It's that girl! Get her! What a blunder to let her get into our secret warehouse! Why do you think I've fed you this long? Well, then? - Our apologies, boss. - Fools! What are you doing? You're a waste of money! Out of my way! What are you standing around like fools for? Quick, go find Koryu! Apologies, sir! Boss, I have something to say. I'm now the only one who can get Koryu for you. I want you to increase the bonus for getting Koryu to 20 million. Hebikura! It's dirty of you to make deals behind our backs! What? There's no need to get so worked up. I'm inviting myself into that deal also. Boss... Isn't it better to get us in a good mood to kill Koryu? Shut up! Your tedious complaints are making me sick! I'll give you the money. Be sure to bring Koryu back with you! Let's begin. Win or lose, there'll only be one hand. The one who wins gets the 20 million job. You draw first. You draw first. The 20 million is mine. Did you think I couldn't see through your trick? My brain's different from your shallow one. The 20 million is mine. Quick, give me the drugs! Give me the drugs. Quick, the drugs! Please! Reika! Please, the drugs. Didn't I tell you never to lose sight of Koryu? Listen, if you fail again, you won't get any more drugs, ever. Reika, are you working for Oh again? How is Rika? Is she doing well? - Is she really OK? - She's fine. How's Koryu? She's all right, isn't she? I don't know what to do anymore, sis. You're not the one who's bad. Turning you into a drug addict was part of Oh's plot to use me. I can no longer escape Oh. But you and Rika are different. Reika, listen to me. Tell Koryu everything. And escape with Rika. Koryu will surely help you. Please. Shurei, what are you doing here? You were discussing silly things, weren't you? Let me see Rika. You're still talking that nonsense. I have no use for your child. What I need is you alone. Also I'll definitely get rid of that Koryu, who you're relying on so much. We'll have Reika do the inviting. Call Koryu! Hello. This is Boutique Noir. It's Koryu, isn't it? I found someone who knows about my sister. Please go to the coal dump in Honmoku at 3:00. Hello, Reika? Koryu, where are you going? Take me with you. Rika, I have something important to do. Wait here and be a good girl, OK? That's no fun. You're a strong girl, aren't you? If so, you'll be a good and wait for me, right? Yes, I'll wait. I'll be back soon. Koryu, please come back soon. Koryu! Let's see your "sure-kill" punch. Where's Shurei? I have nothing to do with Shurei. In any case, it's inconvenient for me to have you nosing around Oh. You have to disappear. You're pretty good. But it's no fun fighting here. How about it...? Here I come! You're certainly skilled. You're quite a fighter to have killed the lady dragon. Take this. See that? That was great! Kurosaki, you are now my right-hand man. You can expect plenty of sweet rewards. I look forward to that with pleasure. Drink up, all of you! Reika! Sister! Come on, quick! - Reika has escaped. - What? Reika! Come on! Sister, forgive me. I didn't want... to be a burden. Reika! Sister... Go to Rika, quickly! Reika! Stand up, you bitch! Shurei, didn't I warn you over and over not to try to escape? Stand her up! You of all people should know what happens if you betray me. You men take note, too. Go find her daughter! I'm back. Welcome home. How are you feeling? - It's really nothing, now. - That's good. Ouch, ouch! That hurt! I guess you really are okay. - Throw it to me! - Here. - Here. - Here goes. - Here. - Again. It's time. Let's go. You too, Mie. We'll come again next week. How boring! Help! Koryu, help me! Koryu! Rika! Koryu! It's Koryu! Get her. Koryu, help me! What? Koryu is alive? Kurosaki, you told me you'd killed Koryu! What does this mean? I killed her for sure, with my "hell punch". Your skills are worthless, too. Where did you hit her with your "hell punch", huh? Aiming to get the 20 million yen for nothing, eh? - What? - Hold on! Kurosaki, I'll give you one more chance. We kidnapped Shurei's daughter. We'll use her as bait to lure Koryu. We'll kill her for sure this time. Women and children aren't my forte. Even so, I'm the only one who can kill Koryu. You and I need each other. You never know what'll happen if you expel someone who knows too much. Boss, is it safe to trust someone like that? Hebikura... It's your turn now. What do you want me to do? There's no guarantee that Kurosaki can get Koryu alone. I always like having a second or third backup. Use the kid as bait and lure Koryu out to that place. I understand. Rika! Koryu! I've been waiting for you, Koryu. I'll take your life in exchange for this girl. - Koryu! - Rika! Are you all right? That's enough of a reunion. Here I come... This will be our final meeting. Come on! Quickly! Shit! What a dirty tactic. Quick, run. Get out of here! What are you doing? Come on! What are you doing? Don't worry about me, just run! Rika, hold on tight. - Koryu! - Rika, run! Koryu, stop this useless struggling! Koryu! - Koryu! - Rika! Koryu! Koryu! Koryu... The end is near. As my parting gift, I'll let you see something... ...to show that all your efforts were a waste of time. Shurei... Mommy! Mommy! Rika! - Rika! - Mommy! - Mommy! - I'm sorry. - Mommy! - Rika! Stop! Mommy! Rika! - Mommy! - I'm so sorry. Mommy, don't die. Mommy! Foolish woman. Stop. The crows will feed on her by morning anyway. Mommy! Shurei... You all did good work yesterday. Those pests have all been eliminated. There should be no problems receiving the gold bullion from Singapore next week. Boss, the lady dragon was no match for you. She was just a girl. That's how people who depend on their physical abilities always end up. Kurosaki was exactly the same. I don't know how good his martial arts skills were, but they're no use to him now that he's dead. Hebikura, you did good work. I've prepared bonuses for you all. Hebikura, we'll start with you. Koryu, you're alive? I've come to avenge Shurei's death. Kill her! Destroy her! Kill that monster! It'll be interesting to see which of us is the real monster. Shall I pull off your mask? The Chinese suit, the wheelchair, the name Ryu-Mei Oh... all lies! You're Lieutenant Colonel Ryuzo Kanbara, formerly of the Kwantung Secret Police! In the chaos following the war, you stole the army's gold bullion and killed my father, too. You've been living a lie for the past 30 years! Now I'm going to send you straight to hell! Is that so? Get him! Stop her! I can't let you live. Koryu, you're really something. But can you defeat me? Hold it! Let me have a piece of him. Please, Koryu. Koryu, it's your friend. Ah, Koryu! Koryu! THE END
