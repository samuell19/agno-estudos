RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM It's okay, we're basically done. Unless you want another set-up? No, I think you've covered everything. Thank you, Sophie. Okay, then, everyone. We're officially done. Thank you! Good job. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Good job, guys. Marissa. Good timing. I just finished the Christmas shoot. It went great. Good. Because I have other news. Steibis Skiwear called. They put you on hold for their next shoot. On hold isn't a booking. I know, but I have a good feeling about this one. I really want you to book it. Spoken like a true friend. I wouldn't mind the commission. Spoken like a true agent. So what's the next step? Besides my waiting. Well, Steibis has to nail down the budget, which should come in a couple of weeks, and when they do, they're going to want to move fast. Did I mention it shoots in The Alps? Hello? Way to bury the lead! It probably wouldn't happen until the first week of January, which means you finally have time for a real Christmas. Really? I can't even remember what that's like... Are you sure there aren't any quick available assignments? Costa Rica? Ireland? Bulgaria? I've always wanted to go to Bulgaria. They have castles. Sophie, I say this as the consummate workaholic... take a break. Go do something Christmasy with your boyfriend. Deck a hall, ride a sleigh. Fine. Castles can wait, and Brent does come back today... Perfect! And it has been a while since I've had a chance to really get into Christmas, which used to be my favorite time of year. Honey, you know I love you, but work-life balance requires both work and life. And preferably balance. One step at a time. Talk to you soon. Mr. Murphy? Order's ready. Okay... So, were there any of the nannies you've met so far that you especially liked? Not really. Yeah. Me neither. How long is Mrs. Christie going to be back in Charleston? She's gone till the 3rd, another two weeks. We're doomed. Hey! I take offense to that. We're two smart, capable, creative individuals, who can surely find a way to take care of themselves. Can Mrs. Griffith do it? I like her. She likes you, and that would be an entirely perfect arrangement if she hadn't hurt her foot. But she's watching me tonight. Yeah. Because I have to stay late and we don't have any other options. No, we can't take advantage of her kindness. So, we're going to have the service send over a bunch of potential nannies, and I've set a deadline for this Thursday for you and I to make a decision. Next week, I have to finish the annual report for the board. Okay. So, just... maybe do us both a favor, and try to find a way to like one of them. If you can. Deal. After all, there's got to be at least one person out there in the world who's strong enough for the Murphy men. Yeah. Soph! Hey. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I had to make a quick stop and change clothes, but... I did get you this. It's beautiful. Thank you. Yeah. It's your favorite color. See? I'm the "Oh, he listens when I talk" kinda boyfriend. You're being extra-charming. What gives? I got a new gig. - Congrats. - Yeah. When does it shoot? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? You just got back from a month in Australia. It is an amazing assignment, Soph. I'm going to be MondoMoon's official photographer, get to follow them on their West Coast tour... and Asia. But you'll miss Christmas. Yeah, but I'll probably be back by New Year's. Yeah, but you'll miss Christmas. I never really took you for the Christmas type of person. Your place isn't even decorated. Well, I've been crazy busy. Which I get. But, honey. You're a professional photographer, too. You know how important it is to jump on these big assignments, whenever they show up, even at Christmas. No, I know. I know. I'll make it up to you when I get back. I promise. Unless you're in Switzerland for the Steibis shoot. How'd you hear about that? We do share the same agent. Well, it's not set yet. It will be. I can feel it. They'd be fools not to hire you. You're going to have an amazing career. - Cheers. - Cheers. Look at that tree. Let me help, Mrs. Griffith. Thanks, Troy. Well, it's really starting to come together. Yeah. I was in the middle of doing it myself... when this happened. Uncle David and I, we don't really have our tree yet, but we will. Yes, you will. Your uncle is a very busy man who loves you very much. Yeah. I know. Hey. Who's this? That's my granddaughter, Sophie. She's the one who took all the photos. She's pretty. - Is she coming for Christmas? - Oh, no. I call Sophie my little Nomad because she loves to travel around so much. Unfortunately, her travels rarely bring her back to Bainbridge anymore. Too bad. I bet she's nice, like you. Thank you, Troy. And I wouldn't mind having her close by again. Especially at Christmas. I think it's Uncle David. Hey. Hey. I'm so sorry I'm late. That's fine. I've been employing Troy as my helper. My mobility's a little less than I originally thought it would be. Yeah. I took Riggs for a walk around the block a couple times, and we baked cookies, and now we're decorating the tree. That's excellent. I'm glad Troy here could be of service. Wait! That's it! What if I stay here over the break with Mrs. Griffith? That way, I could help her by doing things, and she'll be okay, and I won't need a nanny! No. That is not it. You're out of school for two weeks. It's far too long for us to impose. Now, we're getting help. At least until I finish the board report. But it's your company. Well, it's never that simple, okay? We're going to hire somebody. Okay. However, we're both more than happy to help you, Louise, if you need anything while you recover. Thank you, David. Of course. My pleasure. Now... off to bed with you, young man. Okay. Bye. Pathetic. Sophie! What a lovely surprise. Hi. I was just looking at my sad little Christmas tree and it made me think of all the great ones I used to have with you and Granddad. So you had to call. I did. I miss you. What's going on? How are you? Well... it's a funny thing... Her foot? Hairline fracture. Which means I'm going to Bainbridge. Not exactly the break for you I had in mind. Well, both my parents moved to Spain two years ago, so there's just me to help out. What does "help out" entail? Probably something to do with the Christmas Pageant. A Christmas Pageant? Those things are real? You really need to get out of San Francisco more. Are you kidding? Holidays are the only time there's any decent traffic. So have you told Brent? Well, I tried to call, but he's already on his way to Portland to cover the band, so I texted him. Well, their tour swings by Seattle, so maybe he can swing by your grandmother's place and help out with the Bainbridge Christmas Parade. Pageant. Sounds the same in my brain. I'll call you when I hear from Steibis. Okay. Thank you. Grandma! Sophie! Oh, darlin'! Mwah. It's so good to see you. It's so good to see you, too. And I finally get to meet Riggs. Easy, Riggs! Easy. You look wonderful, sweetheart. Thank you. So do you. Let's go inside. It's freezing out. Okay. I'll get my bag. She's already 10 minutes late. That doesn't bode well. Didn't the nanny service say she was having car trouble? Yeah, but that's just it... I need somebody with a reliable car. Fair enough. - But, until she gets there... - Right... Yes. We can go over the report. When did you get so pushy and ambitious? The day we started this company, my friend. So, listen, end of quarter numbers look exceptional, so the board's got to be happy about that. Yeah, and what about next year's projects? What about them? None of the apps we have in development are even remotely as inspired or inspiring as I'd like them to be. We need something with a lot more wow to it if we're going to keep people not only interested, but excited about the product. Do you have any such "wow" in mind? No. I'm afraid not. You see, my brain's fried from working and the school let off for Christmas break last week. Well, listen, the good thing is, we've still got a little bit of time left, and, hey, it's Christmas. Maybe you'll find some inspiration. Yeah, maybe. Oh, honey, I'm so glad you could come on such short notice. Me, too. I'm just sorry it had to be because you got hurt. I'll take what I can get. I wish your parents could have made it, too. Dad said Mom is teaching a seminar in Madrid on the 23rd, so they're staying there for Christmas. Okay. So besides finish decorating and walking Riggs... what do you need me to help you with? Mainly the Christmas Pageant planning committee. I missed the last couple of meetings. I'll drive you. My angel. Hey. I saw some new guy next door. Did the Gilberts move? In January. David and Troy Murphy moved in this May. They're lovely. Actually... Troy helped walk Riggs for me the other day and left this behind. Could you be a dear and take it to him? Now? Sure. Okay. Finally! I'm sorry? Come on in. Come on. I'm... Huh. What do you mean "Huh"? Well, you're just not what I expected. What were you expecting? I don't know exactly, but... Okay, so... Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I've got a video meeting with the office at 3:00 p.m. and you are late, so if we could just make this quick. - Sure. - All right. How do you feel about kids? - Kids? - Yeah. Kids. You know, children, rugrats, munchkins. You do like them, don't you? Some more than others. Okay... - Did you just takes notes? - Sure did. Did you go to college? I did. - Where? - Oregon. Why? It's a good school. They gave me a scholarship. - Do I get to ask you questions? - Not yet. What was your major? Photography and media. Struggling artist. No. Do you know CPR? Are you feeling okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Because you just asked me that? Well, safety is the number one priority of a nanny. I'm not a nanny. Okay. Caregiver, then. But Troy's never going to go for the term "babysitter." Good, not a babysitter either. What title would you prefer? Your neighbor's granddaughter. What? Yeah. I think I can clear this up. Hi. Sophie Griffith, Louise's granddaughter. - You're here! - Hi. Mrs. Griffith said you weren't coming for Christmas. My schedule opened up, and Grandma's hurt, so here I am. I'm guessing you're not a nanny... No. No. She's a photographer. I've seen your pictures, they're really cool. I like this kid. Is this Troy? Yeah. That's my nephew. Well then, Troy Murphy, that is yours. You left it at Grandma's the other day. Thank you. I am so, so sorry and so, so embarrassed. I was expecting the agency to send over another candidate to be one of Troy's temporary nannies for the next few days. That's okay. Everyone needs a spontaneous pop quiz on their life every so often. Keeps the brain active. Right. Are you staying for Christmas? I am. I'm going to help Grandma through New Year's, then, hopefully, I'm off to Switzerland. I'm up for a potential photo assignment. That is me putting my degree to good use. But first, I have to walk Riggs. Can I come? I love Riggs! Troy, we just met Ms. Griffith. Though you now know more about me than most people. And it's Sophie. Please, Uncle David. More the merrier for me. Well... It would actually help while I have my video call. See? Win, win, win. What's your number? 206-555-0415. Now you have my contact info. And just to be safe, here's my business card. After all, safety is the number one responsibility for a nanny. Shall we? He thought you were the nanny? It was hilarious, once we figured it out. Dear. I think David's anxious about getting someone to help out. What's their story? Troy's parents passed three years ago. Car accident. David stepped in to be Troy's guardian. They moved to Bainbridge from Seattle to give Troy a more family-friendly environment. How's it going? David doesn't talk about it much, but I get the impression the first couple years were difficult. But they're better now. Good. Though David doesn't date much. Why are you telling me that? Just an observation. Come on, Riggs. Come on, buddy. All set! Let's go. Hey, come on, Riggs. Oh, my gosh, you're so cute. Come on, boy. How many cameras do you have? Five. Though this is my baby. What about you? Do you have one? Only on my phone. It hurts. It really does. But, maybe I'll ask Santa for one for Christmas. Have you made up your list of wishes yet? No. You should get on that. Christmas is coming soon. It's true. What's this? Christmas Pageant. Wanna go? Yeah. Let's go. Let's go walk by it. Hi. I'm Da... Hey. Sorry I'm a little late. A little? You're over an hour late. Cars. - Yeah. - So... like, when would I start? You know what. I... Yeah, I don't think this is going to work. Thank you. Come on, Riggs. It looks like they're setting up for the Christmas Pageant play. Yeah, it does. "The Night Before Christmas," I like the classics. Simon Baylock, the director. Sophie Griffith. And this is Troy Murphy. Hi, Troy. Did you say "Griffith"? Any relation to Louise Griffith? She's my grandmother. Oh, good. I'm supposed to call her. I'm new to the Pageant Committee this year and, apparently, she's quite the organizer, but she hasn't been to the last couple meetings. Well, she hurt her foot. But we're planning on being at the next one, which is...? Tomorrow. Right before the play auditions. Are you trying out? Oh, no. What about you? - Me? - Why not? It's about a family waiting for Santa on Christmas Eve. And the original poem was published in the Troy, New York Sentinel, so perhaps there's a little Kismet at work here. Here. Here's the script. It's only a half-hour play, but it will be fun. Hey, Sophie. Is everything okay with Troy? Everything's fine with Troy. He's busy studying his lines for the play, but I was just calling to see if you'd be okay with him helping us finish decorating Grandma's house. - Are you sure about that? - Please. Have you seen how many boxes she has? We're going to need his help to put everything up before it's time to take everything down again. All right, then. I'll swing by in a couple hours. Perfect. And David? How did the nanny interview go? Ooh, let's just say you're still the lead. Obviously. These are so cute. That one is cute. That one's old, I think. Right, Grandma? It's older than you are. Put the old ones in the front. Higher, okay? How's that look? That's good, right? Yes, that's the needed touch. Lovely. Why are you a photographer? I blame her. She gave me my first camera at Christmas when I was 11, and I fell in love. I actually got some good ones of you and Riggs in the park. I'll send it to your uncle. Awesome, thanks. "It was the night before..." I'll call him back. I didn't know you were still dating Brent. Why would you think we broke up? You never talk about him. Well, he's either on a job or I am. Where is he now? He's following a band. Over Christmas? You have to take work when you can. Even when you're successful. If he's successful, he can find a way to spend Christmas with you. That's just how it goes when two photographers are dating, Grandma. I swear, in the six months that we've been together, we've been in the same place, same time, maybe three weeks. Time isn't as important as the quality of your interaction. Your grandfather and I fell in love over a weekend in college, and it lasted nearly 40 years. Well, not everyone can have what you and Grandpa had. Or Mom and Dad. Things are different now. But love never changes. - Hi. - Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. That's okay. That's something I've been saying a lot recently. - Hey. - Hey. You guys have really been at it. Or did the elves do it, I wonder? It was mostly us. Well, great job. All of you. Can Troy come over tomorrow and help with finishing touches? I'm afraid Troy has to come to work with me tomorrow. I still don't have anybody to help and I have to be at these meetings, so I can't stay home. But the auditions are tomorrow. Mr. Baylock gave me a script. I'll show you. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, please. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Let us watch him. At least for tomorrow. And maybe beyond. It's not like you have a whole lot of options, and I'm pretty sure I've passed phase one of the interview. - Right, but I can't... - But, you can. - No, but you... - Also can. You came here to spend time with your grandmother, Sophie, not to look after my nephew. Honestly, nothing about this Christmas is my usual. Which is what? Traveling. Last year, I was in Bali, doing a cover of a Yoga magazine. The year before, I was in Tanzania on the Serengeti. When my agent said I had this Christmas off, I didn't know what to do with my spare time. I grew up with doctor parents, who work every available second. It's what I learned to do. You seem so relaxed. Thank you. Mom and Dad also taught me to make the most of an unexpected situation. - Is coming here a situation? - It is. A fun one. I love spending time with my grandmother. She was the most normal part of my childhood. And Christmases with her were my absolute favorites. I know Troy's going to have as much fun with her as I did. Right, but I don't want to impose. I'm offering. I'm here, you need help. Why not help? And Troy is so easygoing. Trust me, he has his moments. But, yeah, that is basically true. So, say yes. Let Grandma and me be co-nannies... at least for tomorrow? Okay, then, but just for tomorrow. Okay. I thought you were going to relax, and now you're in Washington, acting as some kid's babysitter? Troy doesn't like the term "babysitter," so I'm going with "nanny," which is somehow better. What about your grandmother? I thought you were supposed to be helping her? She's onboard. I mean, it's not that much more, really. We're going to the Christmas Pageant meeting today anyway, so now we just go a little bit early to let Troy audition. Hey, listen, hon? I gotta go. Okay. Call me later? Yeah. Sure, sure. - Hey. - Hey. Do I smell pancakes? Hey, buddy. You already had breakfast. But not pancakes! I gotta go. Troy, we... I mean, it's pancakes. I really appreciate this. No problem. That's what neighbors are for... even temporary ones. And you'll be happy to know that Troy and I went over his lines for the play this morning. He's doing great, but he's, you know, a little nervous. I'll be very encouraging. Thank you. Look at that. I guess that's what happens when you're always running behind. Perks of being a boss... no one will say anything. True. Okay, here are my house keys, if you have to run over there for anything. Do you mind calling me, letting me know how the auditions go? - Absolutely. - Thank you. - Bye, Troy. - See ya. - See you soon. - Bye. Simon? You came! Wonderful! Simon Baylock, this is my grandmother, Louise Griffith. At last. I've heard so much about you. - Good things, I hope. - Of course. It's my understanding you're lead on the Toy Drive. That's right. Do you have a second to go over some details? - I was assigned to help out. - Of course. I'll help Troy with his lines. - Good morning, Ross. - David, good morning. Everyone's in the conference room. Already? Don't worry. I brought Christmas danishes. Smart man. Where's Troy? He's with my neighbor, Louise, and her granddaughter, Sophie. Sophie? Is she cute? What, are you 12? I mean, sometimes, yeah. Let's just get this show on the road, shall we? You never answered the question. Not gonna. Very good. Next. "It's a miniature sleigh with..." Oh, right. "Eight tiny..." "Reindeer!" Well done, Walker. Next. Troy? "Merry Christmas..." You'll have to speak up. "Merry Christmas..." A bit louder, please. "To all..." "And..." "To all a..." "...Night." Hey, buddy. So, how'd it go? Yeah. I got fifth reindeer. That's great. That's Comet, right? You should be proud of yourself. I am. I wanted Toby, he's the lead, but I got stage fright. Well, you know, that happens to the best of us. Really? Yeah. Sometimes, even I get too scared to speak, and I do it for a living. But guess what... reindeer number five, Comet, is going to be the coolest reindeer on the team. - No doubt. - Thanks. Here's Sophie. Hey. I took some photos for you. Thank you. He did pretty good, despite the quiet act. - As long as he's okay. - He seems fine. So we're finished here. We were thinking of going to the toy store to pick up some items off Grandma's Toy Drive list. Just calling to see if you're okay if Troy comes with us. David? Did you say toy drive? For the pageant. - Are you still there? - Yes. Do you mind if I join you guys? Sure. Awesome. That's cute. This was my favorite toy camera when I was a kid. I used to pretend I was on the plains of Africa, taking photos of lions and elephants and tigers. Two of them? Yeah, one for Troy and one for the toy drive. So, tech is your baby, huh? It is. I guess that makes you the guy to go to if my laptop acts up. Yeah. And I'll tell you the same thing I tell everybody... - Turn it off and on. - Turn it off and on. So what made you want to come to the toy store with us? It's a longer story, but toy drives have always held a special place in my heart, so whenever I get a chance to give to one, I do. I feel like you have a lot of stories. Doesn't everybody? You more than most. I can see it in your eyes. David? It has come to my attention that you and Troy haven't gotten your Christmas tree yet. Troy, tomorrow's Saturday. Do you want to get a tree? Can Sophie come? Me? Sophie's great at choosing Christmas trees! In a tree farm, which makes it very easy. Troy, Sophie's here to help her grandmother first, remember? It's fine. You should all go together. See? Then that's settled. Let's go get that robot kit you saw. Yeah. All right. Are you getting the impression that maybe... My grandmother is playing amateur matchmaker? Yeah. Okay, so it's not just me. Nope. I will talk to Grandma. Yeah, and I'll talk to Troy. Not that you don't seem really great. You, too! And it's a huge compliment. Same. - I'm just really busy with work. - Ditto. - And I have a boyfriend. - Oh, and there's that. We don't even live in the same state. No. It's a total non-starter. I agree. Good. You get it. Completely. Now that that's settled, do you want to come and get a tree with us tomorrow? Absolutely! Cool. - Good morning. - Good morning. Are you excited about the tree shopping with the Murphys? About that. It's not going to happen. You're not going? I'm going. But, me and David. That's not going to happen. I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sure you do. I'm dating Brent. So you say. Because it's the truth. Are you in love with him? I... we're still early in our relationship. Six months. Is still early. Fine. What do you like about him? Well, he's successful and smart. Do you have fun together? Does he need to be a comedian? He should be someone you connect with. Your grandfather always made me laugh. And think and feel. I'm sorry. You must miss him. Christmas has a way of inspiring reflection. And I just want you to have the same kind of loving relationship I knew. And if Brent can give that to you, then I'm happy for you. He's here. Have fun. Are you sure you're going to be okay? Very sure. Simon might drop by to pick up some toys for this Toy Drive. Simon? It's not like that. Bye. This is awesome! I just wish Riggs was with us. Me, too, bud, but this is going to be a long day. All right, got any preferences? Do they have Fraser Firs? I don't think so. Because Fraser Firs have excellent needle retention. Is that so? How do you know that? I did a photoshoot at a tree farm once. The things you learn. Did you know that even though spruce is popular for Christmas trees, they lose their needles quickly? True story. I want it to be tall! Tall is also good. Well, then tall it shall be! Perfect. This one, please. Thank you. Are you sure you don't want to cut it down yourself? Nah. This way, we have more time for hot chocolate and doughnuts. Yeah. More importantly... this! Gotcha! Can I get some more hot chocolate? You're done already? It was hot. It's not too hot. All right. One more. But make it small. You've already got enough sugar rushing through your veins. - Okay. - Small! - What? - Nothing. You just seem so relaxed. Have I been uptight since you met me? I wouldn't say uptight, more like focused on work. I'm sure it seems like I work all the time, but believe it or not, I cut down significantly after... ...after Troy came to live with me. Having someone to look after can really shift one's perspective. I'll bet. So, what's keeping you busy now? The end-of-the-year board report. And an app project idea. Or lack thereof. Why the lack of? Ascension Invention has been incredibly prosperous these past 15 years, and I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but I feel as though we could do more. More as in...? Well, that's just it, I don't know. It's a gut feeling, but it feels worth trusting, you know? There's this idea that we could be doing something else to connect and help people. I just can't see it yet. Does that sound crazy? No. Not at all. It sounds inspiring. Well, good, because it will be if I can ever figure it out. So what inspires you? Well, I love my career. I love being able to capture moments in time, and I like being able to take those photos of people and places back to other people who might otherwise never get to see it. That's really great. It's more than just a little bit important to love what you do. It is... I sense a qualifier lurking. Not about my career, but maybe... What? How I'm doing it. At least right now. Okay, so in what way? Well, I told you how my parents worked all the time, and I wonder if maybe that's what I'm doing now. I mean... what about... Life? Yeah, life. I was in a similar situation when the accident happened with my brother and sister-in-law. Except I wasn't thinking about life outside of work. Life outside of work found me, and I was not prepared. Well, you seem to be handling it very well, and Troy is great. Thanks. Though much of that credit belongs to his parents, Daniel and Beth. They did most of the real work. I'm just trying not to mess it up. Well, as your unofficial co-nanny, I think you're doing more than just that. Thanks again. It's been an unexpected blessing, to be honest. Before, I had no one. Now I have Troy. It's hard to imagine my world without him. He really is my best friend. David Murphy? Jodi Hall. Hi. What are you doing here? I'm getting a tree, of course. Right. Sophie Griffith, this is Jodi Hall. Hello. Hi. Temporary neighbor. It's really great to see you again. What brings you to Bainbridge? I thought you never left Seattle. That is a longer story. Maybe we should get together and catch up? Sure. Yeah. Wonderful. My number's the same. Got it. It was nice to meet you, Sophie. Yeah, nice to meet you, too. We dated three years ago. - You mean when...? - Yeah. Yeah. Everything in my life was chaotic. It wasn't fair to keep bringing her through it. Did she want to be a part of it? No. That's just it. I needed stability. - Yum! - Bam. - Shorter glass. - What? Just a small. All right. All right. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Do you know what you're going to ask Santa for? I think I have an idea. Who do we have here? Troy Murphy. - Welcome, Troy Murphy. - Thank you. Do you know what you want for Christmas? Well, I can't guarantee it, but I'll sure do my best. Okay. Thanks. Santa wouldn't have smiled if it was anything impossible, right? - I don't think so. - Okay. Good. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. - All right. Merry Christmas. - How was it? - It was good, it was good. All right. Thank you. Shall we? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Thanks a lot. - All right, we'll see you again. Next. There you are. Is everything all right? My agent just texted me to check my voicemail, said it was good news. What about? - I'll call her later. - No, no, no, no. You cannot leave me in suspense like this. That's not fair. Come on. Okay. I booked Steibis Skiwear! It shoots January 4th in Switzerland! Yes! Congratulations! That's amazing. You deserve this. Hey, Sophie! Brent! What are you doing here? Well, the band is playing in Seattle, so... Hey, Brent Willoughby. David Murphy, her grandmother's neighbor. Great. It's great to meet you, David. Yeah, you too. We were getting a Christmas tree. We? It's for my nephew and I. Oh, great. Well, you want help bringing it inside? You know what, I'd love that, yeah. Okay. - We'll see you in there? - Yeah. Do you want to get that side? Oh, yeah. I've been everywhere... the Amazon, Morocco, Antarctica. - Really? - Yeah. It's not all about the glamour, Troy. Being a professional photographer means also being alert to the dangers in the world, too. Always keep that in mind when you're trying to get that perfect shot. I will. Soph knows what I'm talking about, hmm? Yeah. Yeah, where nothing else matters but getting the shot... especially now since your career is... She got the assignment in Switzerland. You did? You got the Steibis gig? Yeah. That's fantastic. Thank you. Why... Why didn't you tell me? I just found out. Well you know what... - Congratulations. - Thank you. You're leaving? Troy's had a long day, so I'm going to get him to bed. But you'll be here tomorrow, right? What time are you coming? Troy, let's let these ladies have some time to themselves, okay? But we were all supposed to decorate our tree tomorrow. We'll talk about this tomorrow. I had really good time today. Yeah, me too. Thanks for letting me help pick out your Christmas tree. I appreciate it. Good night, Louise. Thanks for dinner. Anytime! Bye, Mrs. Griffith. - You all set? - Yup. Out we go. Is the guy who talks a lot Sophie's boyfriend? Yeah, he is. Troy... hey, buddy. Remember, Sophie's only here temporarily, then she has to go back to her own life, okay? Well, that doesn't mean she won't come back here. Let's wait till Sophie comes back to do the decorations. All right. I think that went well. Except for the part where you scared Troy about the dangers of photography. He'll be fine. Says the man who doesn't have to put him to sleep if he has nightmares. Well, neither will you. Don't forget, this suburban nanny thing is temporary, Soph. You'll be back to your normal life soon enough. Nothing about our lives is normal. Bainbridge is normal. Yeah, and boring. Hey, I grew up here. Well, as much as you grew up anywhere. You and your parents were globetrotters, just like us. Speaking of, I might get a chance to shoot an Icelandic travel book. How long will you be gone for? Three, four weeks, but you'll be in Switzerland, so there'll be a minimal overlap. Unless you book another gig, which... you probably will. This is how it's gonna be for us, isn't it? You're gonna be working over there, and I'm gonna be working here, and... Is that suddenly a problem? I think... I want more. Hey, look, Soph, I... Don't worry, I'm not proposing. I'm thinking for myself, and I just, I don't know what that looks like yet. Are you sure you're not just getting caught up in the trappings of Christmas? Feeling sentimental? Maybe... but I find myself looking at families, and wondering what it would be like to be more settled. I don't know. I do know that you and I aren't working. We're not getting enough time to see if we could work, and that's not gonna change. I can't say I'm surprised. Yes, I know. You were never Brent's biggest fan. He's fine, if chatty, and I'm glad David got to see the two of you together. Grandma, we've talked about this. But you were dating Brent then. Now you're not. That's not the only reason. There's Troy to consider, and they're a package deal, and then there's my career. I know you're not telling me to give up on that. Of course not. I know you love it, and you're good at it, and I liked mine, too. Then what are you saying? Find balance. I've been hearing that a lot lately, and it's not easy. No, it is not, but one thing older people know from experience is, it's necessary for a good life, and I want the best possible life for you, whatever that winds up being. I love you. I love you, darling. I've come for Reindeer #5. He's just putting on his boots. Great. Ross! Hi. I'm Ross Reeler, David's friend. Hi. Sophie Griffith. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Come in, guys. - Sure. Ross and I are partners. Although we've known each other since we were pledge brothers. Sophie's here to pick up Troy for the play rehearsal. I'll go check on him. Doesn't matter how many times I see it, it always amuses me to see Seattle's Best Business Bachelor go into paternal-mode. Seattle's Best Business Bachelor? Nope! No, no, no, no... Yes! 2014. Seattle Morning Magazine. You should've seen the photos. I wanna see the photos. No, you will never see the photos. Ross and I were expanding the company, and we just thought it was good publicity. It was good publicity, although I will say, the photo of you staring off into the distance with the sunlight all behind you, I mean, that was my favorite. Why don't you go take a seat, and we'll get to work in a minute. But it's more fun to give Sophie the details and watch you squirm. Speak for yourself. Anyway, it was very nice to meet you, Sophie. You, too, Ross. Yeah, I seriously wanna see those photos. No. Ready? Yeah, let's go. See you, Uncle David. Bye. Have fun! See you. Hey, she is cute. She's a nice person who happens to be being very generous with her time. She's also cute. She has a boyfriend, Ross. That's too bad. I thought you guys had a nice little banter thing going on. Well, it's a moot point. But do you wish it wasn't moot? It doesn't matter. She lives in California, I live here. Her career takes her all over the world, whereas I have to stay here and focus on raising Troy in Bainbridge. And besides, she's already said, she's only here to make the most of an unexpected situation. Nothing more. Okay. Let's try it once. Reindeer up. Now, dash away, dash away, dash away, all! Which one's yours? Well, I... Reindeer #5. He's adorable. Thanks. The Santa version, okay, we're gonna try it one more time, and I'll be Santa, okay? So I get in the sleigh, and, remember... Hi, Marissa. I've emailed you the contract. Just sign it and scan it back to me, and I'll get your itinerary. How long do you think I'll be gone for? Well, they already have a couple of the locations in mind, but they said they're willing to extending the scout by a few days if you have some suggestions. What? Nothing. Troy's playing with a prop from the Christmas play. Is that the neighbor's nephew that Brent mentioned? He told you about the Murphys? He said you've been spending quite a bit of time with them. Well, they've been such a surprise, a good surprise. I'm gonna miss them. You're not thinking about staying up there, are you? What? No! Why would you ask that? Because Brent also said you two broke up, and I can't help wondering if there's a connection. I'm not saying there is, but... I don't have to live in San Francisco, right? Since I travel so much. Well, obviously you can be based anywhere, but it helps if you're close to the action at this stage of your career. You know that. I do. Look, just... try to keep that in mind when you're there. I mean, everything is going so well. There's no reason to shake things up unnecessarily, okay? Okay. Bye... Hey, Uncle David. Hey! - How was rehearsal? - It was good. Being a reindeer's cool. I had no doubt. Hey, why don't you go wash up your hands? You've been out all day. All right. Waiting until the last possible second. Christmas is next week. Yeah, I know, and I want this place to be fully festive, so, hopefully, we can get it all done today, 'cause tomorrow, Troy and I are going into the office. Why are you taking him to work? I had an unexpected lunch. Do you want Grandma and me to watch Troy? Really? Hello, co-nanny here. Besides, I love hanging out with Troy. We've had a lot of fun. Well, thank you, that would be fantastic. I wasn't sure, you know, about asking. Why? We've been doing it all week. This lunch isn't work-related. How mysterious. It's so not mysterious. It's just with Jodi. Jodi? Like, ex-Jodi? It's not like that. It's just a-just a catch-up. That's all. Do you want to decorate the tree? I would love to. As soon as I locate those tree decorations. You can't find them? I didn't say that. It's a work in progress. All right, then, let's go look for them. Okay, how long have you lived here? Since May. Look, I know it's a bit of a mess, but it's hard to find the time. And when I do find the time... well, it's hard because a lot of these boxes came from Dan and Beth's. You'll settle in eventually. My Charles Dickens Christmas Collection. Do they go on the tree? No, no, they do not. Got it. This was Dan and Beth's. As soon as it got to the top of the tree, they used to say then they were ready for Christmas. What were they like, your brother and sister-in-law? I thought Dan hung the moon. Beth, too. When you mentioned the toy drive, it brought back a lot of memories. Sometimes, that was the only way we could get presents at Christmas. I mean, my parents did whatever they could, but we had some lean years, and so we had to rely on the kindness and charity of other good people to see us through, more times than I can remember. I'm just so grateful. I really hope that comes across. I'm still struggling to... you know, learn to be okay when I can't repay somebody else's kindness. But kindness doesn't need to be repaid, not if it's genuine... and letting others help you is just as much of a gift as receiving it. Uncle David! Did you find the decorations yet? Yeah, we're coming! Thank you. You're welcome. Perfect. You're gonna blind somebody. I'm gonna put this on top of the fireplace, okay? Perfect! Three, two... One. Whoa! Those look good. Those look really good. They taste pretty great, too. I know. We're not supposed to eat those. Her kitchen, her rules. Okay. They are good. They really are. Maybe you could quit photography and become a baker. Not gonna happen. I just thought it might be a way to see you more often. Well, that can be done without a professional overhaul. Hey, Riggs looks a little lonely. He needs a dog biscuit. Thank you, Troy. No problem. Hey, Riggs. Hey, buddy. Wanna treat? So, David's on a date? Well, he says it's not a date, but it is his ex, and she's beautiful, and she obviously wants to hang out with him, so you do the math. I feel you already did. Where are you going? Simon's coming by to take me to the theater's holiday party. It's his way of trying to recruit me. It won't work, but, still, I'll get some free food. What about your foot? Getting better every day. Okay, well, take your cane, and make sure you sit as much as possible. I'm serious. So bossy. Have fun. It's so lovely to run into you. Yeah, of all the places I thought that I'd run into you again, a Christmas tree farm in Bainbridge has to be at the bottom of the list. Yeah, well, a lot has changed. I can tell. Is Sophie good with Troy? Oh, yeah. But we're not romantic, or anything like that. Okay. How are things with Troy? Much better than they were in the beginning, that's for sure. I think we're getting the hang of it, or starting to. You have to be careful, don't you? With children. There's so much responsibility. There's a reason that I was at the tree farm, one I owe all to you... and how you... broke up with me when you did. Well, now I'm intrigued. I'm engaged. Jodi! That's why I was at the tree farm. My fiance, his daughter, and I, we were buying our first tree together. That's terrific. Congratulations. Right? Me as a step-mother. Yeah, I never pictured you like that. I know. You danced around that when you were ending things with me, but I could read between the lines. You were wrong, but you were too busy pushing me away to notice. And I'm glad that you didn't. Being engaged, it's the best thing that's happened to me, so thank you. You're welcome. Now, tell me more about this Sophie you're supposedly not dating. Number one, we're not dating. - But you want to. - No... No, don't try and sneak that past me, because I won't believe you. Come on, Riggs. You think he's tired? Yeah, maybe a little. Hey! Hi! Hi, Uncle David. You're home for the day? I sure am. You know, I had this sudden urge to go ice skating, which never happens, and I thought to myself, "Who'd want to go with me, I wonder?" Yeah. Me too? Do you want to? I'd love to. Ha ha! Pow! Come on, Riggs. Come on, Riggs... Come on, Riggs, let's go! So, how'd it go, with Jodi? It was good. I got to hear all about her engagement. She's engaged? She is, yeah. That's wonderful. Is it? It is, isn't it? I mean... I don't know. I'm happy for her. Excellent. How's Brent doing? I don't know. We... we broke up. You did? Yeah, after the dinner. We never really spent enough time together to find out if we were right for each other... Right. ...and the way things were going, I didn't think that wasn't going to change. Are you okay? 'Cause we can go... I am, thanks. Hey, Uncle David? Can we go ski up at... Squamuh... Squalmie... Snoqualmie? Yeah. Of course. We're going up after Christmas to do some sledding. It's gorgeous. Do you and Louise want to join us? She can bring a friend, hang out at the lodge for a couple hours while we tear up the snow. Yeah, that sounds fun. I'll ask. All right. Uncle David, I'm kind of hungry. A common refrain. Do you have dinner plans? Grandma's out, I'm heating up some leftovers. Uncle David made pot roast. You cook? Yeah, you know, when I have time. They don't call me "The Best Business Bachelor" for nothin'. Come on. And he is out like a light. He's kind of a puzzle wizard, isn't he? Yeah, he gets that from Beth. I kinda love this song. Well, then, it would be a shame to let a song you kinda love go to waste, wouldn't it? Shall we? I should probably head back. Thanks for spending the day with us. We had a lot of fun. So did I. What am I doing? Okay, so tell me if I've got this straight. The idea is that it's an app that helps people that want to do nice things for people at Christmas connect with people in need of specific help? "Christmas Giving," and we keep it local, just here in Bainbridge and Seattle at first. We'll work out the kinks, and we'd probably have to vet both sides, but I think this could really work. It could definitely work. I mean, it's gonna take a lot of man-hours, but it's a great idea. What got you thinking of this? it was Sophie. How generous she's been with her time and everything. It got me thinking about how this is the time of year that people are most motivated to give. Sophie. She's been so amazing, Ross. Guess she was the inspiration you needed. All right, check this out. Yeah. It's Brigid from Steibis Skiwear. Hi there, Brigid... Yes. Yes, Sophie is thrilled to be working with you, she has a ton of ideas... Push the date up? To when? December 23rd? The shoot would be the 26th, but you have to fly back to San Francisco and pack and catch a plane to Zurich. Yeah, but I have plans. The Christmas Pageant is on the 23rd. I can tell them you can't make it, but they could go with another photographer. Tell me what you want me to do. Tell them... tell them I'll be there. Okay. There she is. Louise said I'd find you out here. You were looking for me? I am. I wanted to thank you. For? For inspiring me to come up with my new app. It's called "Christmas Giving." - You figured it out? - Yeah! It's all thanks to you, and everything you've been doing for your grandmother and Troy... and me. Sophie... I... What is it? They pulled up the photoshoot. I have to leave on the 23rd. Leave Bainbridge. David... Which we both always knew you would be. I guess I just let myself forget for a little while. We both did. I'm sorry. Hey... You have done nothing wrong. It's all just... ...an unexpected situation. I don't get it. Yes, you do. No, I really don't. You obviously have feelings for one another. And very different lives. He's a single parent living in Washington state, and I'm in San Francisco when I'm not constantly on the go everywhere. Things can be rearranged. But, Grandma, think about it. I've barely known him two weeks. What am I supposed to do? Completely uproot from everything over something that hasn't even really begun? I would have for your grandfather after that first weekend, absolutely, and he would have done the same for me. The difference is here there's a child involved. That changes things. It was hard enough with Brent when we lived in the same city and we had the same profession. At least he understood when I had go to Africa, or Australia at the drop of a hat. What if Troy doesn't? I don't want him to resent me, and David's right, he's already been through enough. But why? I don't understand. I already told you, they're busy getting ready for Christmas themselves. But they were busy this whole time, and it wasn't a big deal. I just... I really miss them. I know. Troy... Troy? Come on in. I don't understand. Hey, listen, you and I? We'll always be friends, I promise, and I'll be back. I'll miss you, though. Troy! Troy! Hi. Hey. He's here. Hey... Come on, buddy, get your things. Can Riggs still come with us to the play? We'll see. You're gonna do great in the play. I... I just wish you could be there. Me too. - Good night. - Good night. Thank you. You're welcome. Make sure you take as many photos of the Alps as possible. Absolutely. Are you sure you don't want to say goodbye? I emailed a little something yesterday, and I never heard back, so it's probably for the best. Are you sure they got it? Maybe go over just to check. And there's a sign from the universe. I love you, Grandma. I love you, too. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. I'll call you soon, okay? I'm ready to go. Let's go. David, isn't it gorgeous? It's beautiful. - Are you excited? - Yeah. Of course, we're excited to see our big man in action. - Hey, can I hold Riggs? - Sure. Did you get Sophie's email? No, when did she send it? Yesterday. Can we check that email? You know you could lose the job, right? Yes, but I just have to have faith that there'll be more in the future. You can always go back to Bainbridge in the future, too. But I can't make up missing Troy in the Christmas play. I remember that. I like us like that. Yeah. You got me so good. I asked Santa for a family for Christmas. What do you say we make Sophie a Christmas card? Huh? - Sure. - Yeah. Well, let me at least check to see if we can push it, so you can leave a couple of days later. Okay, but I'm willing to let it go if necessary. I have to say, when you fall, you fall completely. I really do. I have Brigid's home phone. I'll see what I can do. Agent me wants to say you owe me, but friend me is really happy for you. Louise? Could you do us a favor and make sure Sophie gets this? Well, of course. There you are! Something wrong? Yeah, the boy who was supposed to play Toby got a cold, and he won't be here. Can Troy step in? Well, I don't know. Troy? Do you want to do this? But what about my reindeer position? I've already figured that out. Okay. Come on, Riggs. Have fun. I'm just going to step out for a moment. Are you all right? Yeah. I just need some air. Those photos Sophie took, they're... Well, she's extremely talented. I'm very glad that she's pursuing her dreams. Thanks, Marissa. - Sophie! - Grandma! Oh, honey... Where are Troy and David? Troy's backstage, and David just went outside. They made this for you. Thank you. Excuse me. "Dear Sophie. Thank you so much for everything you did for us while you were here. Part of me wants to find a way to repay you, but you're right, genuine kindness never needs to be repaid, and if there's one thing you are, Sophie, it's genuine. So instead, I'll simply tell you how much you mean to me and Troy, and how our Christmas was made perfect by having you here with us. We will miss you. I miss you. David." Thanks for the card. Sophie? What are you doing here? I thought you'd be halfway to Switzerland by now. Well, I realized that I could take the assignment and gain a new client, but I'd risk losing something much more important to me, you and Troy, and spending this Christmas with the people I love. I've never really hated technology before. Steibis is okay with pushing my departure to the new year. Does that mean you still have the assignment? If I accept it. Accept it. Really? Yes. We'll have to wait till I get back to go skiing. Well, maybe in Snoqualmie, but I hear Switzerland's not too shabby. You'll come with me? If you want us to. Yes, I'd love that. We can make this work. We can. The play! Is starting! We can't miss Reindeer #5. No, but actually, there's been a bit of a change. Up, reindeer! Now, dash away, dash away, dash away, all! Ho-ho-ho-ho. Ho-ho-ho... Merry Christmas to all... ...and to all a good night! RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
