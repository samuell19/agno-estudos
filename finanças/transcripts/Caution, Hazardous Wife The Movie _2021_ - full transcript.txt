A dream ... (Sakurai) This is a message from the Tamami city hall and the merchants' association. Smoking is not allowed on the streets around Tamami Station. Ready? Hello. It's a bargain. I recommend this too. Hi, Kumi. What would you like? Hi, Kumi. Onions and carrots. Two croquettes. Thanks again, Kumi. Thank you. After the methane hydrate R&D lab there will be land reclamation and storage tanks. It must be stopped to protect the nature of Tamami. The R&D lab must not be constructed! Let's put our strength together and fight! We must regain control of our local government! My name is Igarashi! Madam Mayor! Mayor! A word about Mr. Igarashi who announced his candidacy in the next mayoral election. A strong opponent. But I believe that the R&D lab is essential to the future of Tamami. I can't lose as an advocate of methane hydrate research. Your car is here. Mayor! Foul play may be involved in the disappearance of Prof. Kitahara. Excuse us. I want your comment. Give us a feasible explanation! Not everybody wants the lab! One submission per person to be sent in by July 16. The name will be announced on July 30, its 2-month birthday. A 56-year-old man has been missing since last month. A professor of Tamami University and a methane hydrate researcher Kenji Kitahara disappeared last month. I'm home. Hi. Here. I used herbs in the sauce. It's good. Herbs make a lot of difference. How was the workshop? Tiring. Teaching is much easier. I'll cut it for you. Evening shower. I'm finished. Correct. Class is over. Stand up. Attention. Thank you. Smile, please. (Principal's Room) Now a serious face. Here we go. Please shake hands now. Thank you. Look this way, please. Are you ready? We appreciate your huge donation for repairing our gymnasium. It's reassuring to have your support, Mr. Yokoo. The research and development of methane hydrate has just started. We'll be in town for a long time. Our research firm must contribute to the local community. What are you doing? I came to see the principal. Thank you. Mr. Yabe, do you know him? No ... Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? - Upstairs? - Not there. Where the hell is it?! Forget it. Mess up the place. Damn it. Who did this? Anything stolen? I don't think so. We don't have anything worth stealing. All right. Those dirty bastards who support the mayor ... Mr. Ohnuki! Sea bream and horse mackerel. One each. Thank you. How about an Atka mackerel? - I'll take one. - Thank you. Kumi! Yuji, what are you doing here? I thought you'd be here. You came to pick her up? You two are lovebirds. Here you go. Is this how you feel today? You seem a bit more fragile than before. The other day ... I had a strange dream. Dream? I don't know where I was. But I was fighting. It was so realistic. You said you get engrossed in combat video games. Were you playing? Yes. But ... That must be why. Video games have a strong effect on the brain. I suggest you quit playing. I understand. Um ... Yes? Will I ever get my memory back? Caution, Hazardous Wife: The Movie (18 months ago) Hi. Freeze. The target and foreign agents have been hit. Send backup. Roger that. Nami! Nami! Nami! I'm so glad you're safe. Amnesia? Yes. She's not faking it. New mission. Tamami? Methane hydrate R&D is a big deal in our country right now. There may be a big deposit off the shores of a small seaside town. The government contracted a firm owned by Global Money Holdings. It's suspected of misusing funds. Money laundering? No proof yet. But money is definitely being moved to Russia. Go undercover and investigate Yokoo. I got you a cover name and occupation. Take her with you. It's a small town. Being unmarried will attract attention. If she gets her memory back and she won't cooperate with us get rid of her yourself. Is that clear? Yes. (Present time: Zhuhai City, China) The large Typhoon 9 is expected to hit the Kinki and Chubu regions. Beware of violent rain and winds and high waves. Typhoon 9 is traveling north over the Pacific Ocean toward ... Last night around 10:40 a man was found unconscious in a parking lot in Tamami. Mr. Tadashi Masuda, a reporter of the Tamami Times was taken to a hospital where his death was confirmed. He was covering a story on the methane hydrate business. The police were informed about his troubled relationships and suspect suicide as the manner of death. You're Kumi Sakurai. I'm Yuji Sakurai. We met at a party and got married 18 months ago. For me ... it was love at first sight. What are you doing? I look really happy. I ... want my memory back. My turn to bathe. Our hottest topic these days is methane hydrate. Here are some messages from our listeners. A 56-year-old housewife. The sea of Tamami is a precious legacy left to us by our ancestors. I am strongly opposed to the R&D that would damage it. A 43-year-old male shop owner. I want our town to get back its vitality. The project will be good for Tamami ... I always feel empowered by this sea. I definitely don't want to lose it. I am strongly opposed. A 38-year-old housewife. Hello? I just finished the workshop. What are you up to? Now? I started cooking dinner. Thanks. You're welcome. When are you coming home? Before dinner. Okay. See you later. Yeah. This Russian research vessel was the first to successfully dissociate and recover methane gas. I'm sure it'll give us good results as well. I understand Prof. Kitahara, who went missing, was working on this ship. Yes ... He suddenly disappeared. We have no idea what happened. Excuse me. Madam Mayor, shall we go? This is Yokoo. Did you find it? I'm sorry. We're trying. The mayoral election? No problem, I think. You think? Listen to me. The annual subsidy for methane hydrate R&D is over 20 billion yen. The Russian ship will enable us to legitimately move at least 2 billion yen to Russia. The lab has to be built to ensure that. We already received the money. Retrieve that thing and get the mayor re-elected. Do what you have to. Understood. Here you go. 400 yen. - No change. - Thank you. Hello. Are you okay? Good ... I'm surprised you were able to dodge it. Are you okay?! Take care. Are you okay? He was driving at a dangerous speed. Wait! Investigate more thoroughly! I already told you. He stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake. I don't think so. Something's not right. Mister, say something! Find out what really happened! Excuse me. Kumi! - Yuji ... - Are you hurt? No. I just fell down. Mr. Sakurai ... Your wife? Mr. Yabe ... The police are writing it off as an innocent accident by the old driver. Was it really an accident? You think so too? After I announced my candidacy in the mayoral election we've been getting threats. The police say it was an accident but the mayor's supporters ... No. Yoko ... The mayor isn't a coward. Nobody thinks Yoko is behind it. Really? Yoko, the mayor, is his ex-wife. They started disagreeing 4 years ago over the methane hydrate R&D and ... Is that right? But until then we used to discuss how to improve this town. The fishing industry is dying. Now, the town's only source of income is tourism. Something has to be done. Yoko and I feel the same way. That's why we shouldn't resort to short-term answers! That sea is our one and only asset. Without that beautiful sea this town will definitely be ruined. They feel the same way. But they can't be together ... We'll always stay together. Let's go. What is it? Nothing. You sensed malice? Right before the truck came at me ... Since then I've become very sensitive. I always feel nervous and strung out. You lost your memory after a traffic accident. I don't remember it. You must be having flashbacks that are making you feel vulnerable. I'll prescribe a mood stabilizer. Take one before you go to sleep. It's been a while, Isayama. Mr. Kamioka, when did you come back? 2 days ago. How are ya? Good. And you? Not too bad. You got married. Yes. You were an odd trainee but I didn't expect this. Everything's good? Glad to hear that. Brings back memories. I read the report. A tough enemy. To the people of this town, he's more a savior than a businessman. Infiltrate the opposition. Yabe is the mayor's ex-husband. Your wife connected us to Igarashi. A different approach might dig up something new. All right. - See you tomorrow. - Good night. Be careful. I knew it ... Have a nice day. You too. - May I? - Of course. Homemade? Uh ... Yeah. Nice. I remember the old days. Excuse me. I heard about Mr. Ohnuki. How is he? The shogi club advisor? Your husband? He's working on the weekends to fill in for his hospitalized co-worker. That's too bad. I have nothing to do at home all by myself. Then why don't you make a baby? It'll keep you busy. Baby? One croquette. Thank you. Juri, how's your cafe? It's doing pretty well. I want some sauce. - Here you go. - Thanks. - See you. - Bye. Thank you. - See you again. - Yes. Excuse me. Thank you for the other day. Oh, it's you. How are you? Fine. Yeah? Good. We want your money, faggot. - I don't have any. - I'll kick your ass. - He really will. - Stop squirming. Here we go. Give it back! Pink wallet with a cat. - Ain't it cute? - A real faggot? What are you doing? Who's this? What do you want? Mind your own business. Ow! It's gonna break. What the hell?! Asshole! - Let go of us! - Stop it! Let's go! Screw you. Are you okay? - Hey! - Let him go. You've got some guts. You think so? My cafe. It's really small. That's my hobby. My customers find it amusing. Everyone's having fun. It's a nice cafe. Thanks. It was my dream for years. It wasn't easy but it finally came true. Dream ... Mr. Yabe? Mr. Yabe? Taking photos of the sea is his hobby. He also took the ones in the office. I've been doing this for years but it never gets boring. It's your passion. To the locals, the sea of Tamami is full of memories. In good times and bad times this sea was always here. Oh yeah? What are you drawing? My dream. Dream? After I lost my memory, I hadn't given any thought to it. So ... Let me see. Cafe? I want to open one with you. Sounds good. Really? Are you serious? It doesn't have a name? I can't think of one yet. Nami! If she gets her memory back and she won't cooperate with us get rid of her yourself. We need to talk! Why aren't you protecting us?! Two of our members were attacked! It's being investigated. We're doing everything we can. Mr. Yokoo, hello. Yokoo! Is the police working for you?! Paying them off?! The chief is waiting for you. I heard about ... Wait! Yokoo! It's off limits! A cafe? Not right away but I want to start something. All right. I'll teach you the fishermen's secret recipe. Ta-da! Looks good, huh? It tastes just as good. It's great that you and your husband share a dream. Do you have someone special in your life? That's a secret. Tea removes the fishy smell. It does? I recommend cold English tea. Kumi, you don't have to write it down. Anything else? Let me think ... I just remembered something I have to do. Another time? - Sure. - Sorry. Kumi! Yuji ... I thought you were with the club today. I'm sorry I lied. They get threats. I didn't want to put you in danger. Kumi! Are you lying about other things? About my past ... How we met ... No other lies. I'm sorry. Let's walk. Beautiful. It looks like your picture. It made me realize. That I hadn't given serious thought about our future together. I'll see you later. I'll be right there. What do you want?! Spunky old man. Go away, lady. We're just fooling around. Go away. Get her out of here. Go! Bastard! Kumi! Kumi ... I'm glad you're okay. I wasn't thinking. I just wanted to help Mr. Igarashi. That's all I remember. Thank goodness you weren't badly hurt. Mr. Igarashi? He only suffered minor injuries but he's awfully shaken up. Another thing. The mayoral election ... I can't! He needs time to reconsider his candidacy. He also has a pre-existing condition. And also ... Also what? The office was vandalized some time ago. Then our members were attacked. - Did you report it? - Of course. But the police won't take us seriously. Kumi. Watermelon? Let's eat. Sweet. Kumi? Kumi! Kumi! - Kaho ... - I heard what happened. How's your injury? It healed already. How is it? Great. Even better than before. Yuji. I have to apologize. For what? Somewhere in mind, I was doubting you. I still don't remember anything. I wasn't sure if you truly loved me. But ... I'll stop worrying. I'll leave the past behind. I'm going to embrace this life we have now. Don't push yourself. I'm not. No need to leave the past behind. My feelings won't change. So you can just be yourself. Have any of your memories returned? Nothing in particular. Really? Yes. Except ... Yes? When I saw how worried my husband was at the hospital I remembered how I lost my memory in an accident. I couldn't even remember my name after it happened. I was so anxious. But ... I knew I smelled his scent before. So I finally figured it out. I send him off to work in the morning. I do the housework and go shopping. We eat dinner together and talk about the day. We laugh at silly stories. The life that I have with him. Our life together ... is what's most important to me. We're finished today. See you in 2 weeks. What do you think? The color pyramid indicates a stable state of mind. The thermography shows no signs that she's lying. There was also nothing faked about her facial expression. Understood. Keep me informed. Hello? Thanks for coming right away. What's up? I have a favor to ask. Part-time job? Yeah. At Juri's cafe. He wants me to help him some nights. But ... I wasn't sure at first but it'll be a good experience. I'll still make your lunch. Okay? That's my hobby. Nothing to do with Kumi. Isn't it a nice cafe? It is. Good. Igarashi knows where the HDD is. Are you sure? Yes. That's no good. We have to do something fast. He's busy right now. Mr. Yokoo, it's Mr. Asanuma. Yokoo speaking. Did you find it? We have a strong lead. We're on it. I see. I also have some info. You're being investigated. Me? Be careful. If it becomes a problem, get rid of it. Yes, sir. The Public Security Bureau ... Don't worry about it. We will handle it. Mr. Volkov! When did you come to Japan? Take care. You don't need me to come pick you up? Juri will give me a ride home. See you later. She's pretty. Here you go. Oh, Juri ... - Sorry. - No problem. - Enjoy. - Clams and horse mackerel. You are so pretty. Are you a local? Don't even try. She's happily married. Too bad. You're married, huh? - She's so pretty. - Go home. Good night. You're still here? I have to catch up on my paperwork. Mr. Igarashi was released from the hospital. I hope he's still going to run in the election. Why? It's an important election for the future of Tamami. The citizens should be able to choose their mayor. What do you want? Hi. Hi. Sorry I'm late. I was learning how to keep the books. Yeah? What's on TV? An American documentary. Robert was still alive. He survived because the steel rod penetrated his body in a way that left his heart and main artery unharmed. It was a miracle that he survived. It's a miracle. Yeah. I'm a bit sweaty. I need a bath. Croquette from the market? I love it. How's Mr. Igarashi? He's still not sure about the election. But the attacks have stopped. The one on Mr. Igarashi became news. That must be why. It's just a rumor. The opposition was attacked again. No. The attackers were attacked. By someone in a black costume who was really strong and agile. Like a superhero! Protecting the weak. I heard it was a woman. - Really?! - A hot one? All female superheroes are hot! See you. See you. This feels great! Nami? Juri?! Are you okay? Iwao ... What's going on? Hello ... Why didn't you tell me? You wouldn't approve ... You're right. None of this is her fault. I don't know how strong you are but they're gangsters. They might retaliate. It's too dangerous even for you. He was on the karate team when I was its advisor. Although I hardly know karate ... He was a strong player, the hero of the team. The police are unreliable. I hear things from my customers. The research firm that's against Mr. Igarashi is paying off the police. So they'll never get arrested. I understand. I'll ask Mr. Igarashi not to run in the election. But ... I don't want to put you and my friends in any more danger. You're giving up? No. I'm still going to protect the sea of Tamami. Don't worry about it. You take care of yourself. I'm sorry for causing you trouble. It's okay. I wanted to work here. But ... I didn't want my teacher to know. But I'm glad to see you again. Mr. Yabe ... I'll come back to eat. I'll drive you home. I might be late. Don't wait up. Mr. Igarashi asked me to do something for him. Do what? Professor Kitahara who disappeared left his research data on the ship. Before that reporter died he sent me a letter and told me where it's hidden. Shinji ... Will you go get it? Me? The data apparently proves that the methane hydrate deposits thought to be found off the shores of Tamami will run out in 10 years. Only 10 years? I was daunted by the whole ordeal. But it's time to do something. I'm going to get the data and give it to the mayor. But she's the strongest advocate of methane hydrate. She's ... Yoko seriously wants what's best for Tamami. If she sees the data I'm sure she'll finally come to her senses. You believe in her. We're divorced but she was once the love of my life. You're home. I didn't want to wake you. Kumi. Let's go to the sea. What's that? Our cafe's logo. - Bye. - See you. She's a real agent among agents. How could she lose her memory? If you ... want to protect your life you will ... bring us the HDD! I'll be back in touch. Now go and listen to that young gentleman. Thank you! Thank you! Shall we? Now turn around and face this man! I have to do what I can for them. Mr. Hata wants to attend the kick-off party tomorrow. The chief cabinet secretary?! Other VIPs from the resource industry will also be there. Is Yabe going to cooperate? The mayor is attending the party on the research ship tomorrow. Yabe will explain the situation to her while I go find the HDD. Without Mr. Igarashi, it's a matter of time before she signs the papers. Inform the mayor first ... Is there a problem? It was a good idea to infiltrate the opposition. If Yabe is right we can at least prevent the funds from moving to Russia. You really don't need backup? I can handle it. All right. Be careful. Mr. Igarashi stepped down? Now you'll definitely be re-elected. I see ... Is that a problem? Of course not. Good. Methane hydrate R&D is the only thing that will save Tamami. Many people are already involved in the project. There's no turning back. I know. See you. Hold on. I almost forgot. We should take a trip. Sure. But why? Something different for a change. Okay. See you. Bye. We should get going. Thank you for coming today. Thank you for celebrating the methane hydrate project. This party is sponsored by GMH Energy Corporation that strives for a bright future. Let's start the party with a ritual to wish for safety on the seas. Mayor Sakagami! Thank you. Ready? Go! What's important to you right now? My husband and ... Go ahead. Hello? I never thought you'd start a family. Because of you, he will die. I'm going to kill the person you love. He will suffer and eventually die. Was it your husband? No. Shall we continue? The important thing is ... my peaceful life with my husband ... What? Kumi? It's over. No need to leave the past behind. So you can just be yourself. I'm going to kill everyone you care about. They will suffer and die. That was fast. You're not getting the HDD. I'm going to protect her. Our true mission is not the HDD. Go! Nami! My memory's back. Get rid of them! Thank you very much. Good luck. Yoko. Not here. Give me 10 minutes to talk to you alone. Please. Over there. Data? Are you sure? You'll get the evidence. Trust me and don't sign the papers. But ... Don't worry, Madam Mayor. There's no such data. Even if it does exist, just throw it away. Excuse me? I told you a lot of people are already involved in this project. There's no turning back. You always have a choice. Don't be fooled. Shinji! Mayor. I need your signature now on this building permit. I won't sign it. That's too bad. I thought we could be good partners. We'll talk later. Tell me what's going on. I wanted to go to the party. Stop joking. Why did you come here? If you kept pretending ... You knew? Sort of. But I believed in you. I was trying. I seriously was going to leave the past behind and stay with you. But the past wouldn't let me go. Past? Did they come from your past? On a time machine. Time machines come from the future. Whatever you say. Why? Why did you lie to me? I wanted to protect you. Over-protective. That's not nice. Well, excuse me. I bet you liked the sweet amnesiac wife. In a way. What about the trip? I wanted to go. Liar. You too. Drop the gun! At least I can kick well. What was that? - I don't know. - Go check. Nothing to worry about, folks. Stay calm. Don't worry. Everything's okay. No, it's not! Cooperate with us. I wanted to be your wife. Not a cooperator. I wanted a family. A real family with you. Playtime's over! Put the gun down. Do you hear me? Put it down now! I've been waiting for this moment. You're gonna watch the man you love die. And then I'll kill you. Nami! Why? Now I know why the organization wanted to find you so badly. Why don't you come with me? And return to the organization? I don't belong to any organization. I go where the money is. No loyalty to a country. No conflicted thoughts about justice. Did you expose Nami to the Russians? They paid me better than the organization. I didn't think you'd find out about the HDD but I also sold out the Public Security Bureau. I see ... Now I get it. I was their decoy to lure you out. It's over, Kamioka. We knew sensitive information was being leaked but didn't know by whom. We thought we could lure you with this woman with a big bounty. Is that why you approved of my marriage with Nami? Yes. But her amnesia was unexpected. Remember what I taught you. They don't care about us and our lives as individuals. Think carefully. Before you lose what's important to you. Don't shoot! Bang. Tell me one last thing. Do you love me even now? With or without your memory - My feelings ... - Liar. Shoot me. Kill me if you love me. I love you. Well done. Let's go. Let's go! The Tokyo Metropolitan Police arrested the president of Global Money Holdings for money laundering. He is suspected of ... (3 months later) Hello. Mr. Sakurai! Long time no see. Yeah. - Hello, Mr. Sakurai. - It's been a while. - Hello. - Hello. The mayor was re-elected but the research ship got wrecked. What's gonna happen to us? We're at least alive. We'll manage. - Here you go. - Thank you. Um ... How is Kumi? Is she doing well? Yes. Glad to hear that. I'm sure Kumi is doing fine. She's a strong woman. Hello. Yoko ... I heard you were here. I want your help. Coffee, please. Shoot me. Kill me if you love me. It's a miracle. I love you. transcribed, edited, retimed, translated (the foreign languages/blank lines) by neet21_
