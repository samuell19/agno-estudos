They were the craziest fractures I've ever seen. Her bones were sticking straight out. Come on, Jessica. I swear... I couldn't even get my phone out. When I got there, I dropped all my equipment. I was sure we'd get help, so I didn't panic. But... four patients, and no other ambulances showed up! Maybe if their injuries hadn't been as serious... But they were all critical patients, and you can't treat that many with only one ambulance. There's just no way. You end up not giving proper care to anybody. So I drove them to the General Hospital. So awful. The mother seemed alright and then just died. Two guys stole a motorcycle and ran over them. You know how Guadalupe Ave. has those crosswalks? That's where they got hit. Let's go, guys! We're off. Take care. I don't know how you can see with that tiny fucking mirror. Tilt the mirror up, Dad. - Code 41 is a tractor-trailer? - No, it's a drunk person. No, they use 41 for big trucks. Tractor-trailers are Code 44! When someone is drunk, we always hear Code 41. Look at you! Saying something smart for once. Code Z-2 at a bar? Let's wait for confirmation. Or you want to head out'? It's a Z-2! Is it confirmed yet? No, but I doubt it's a false alarm. What's the street'? Look it up. Let's go! Accident! Get on the sidewalk. bicycle! Get out of my way, bicycle! Here I come! Keep moving, bus! Get out of the way. This is why people die! Because people like you don't move! Take a right here. Here on the right. Let's go! This is Campeche St. on the right. It's there on the corner. That one! They've been waiting for 40 minutes! Keep it moving, taxi! Taxi, move! Listen to me! Tlacotalpan is this street. - Straight ahead! - No, it's right here. On the second floor. Eighteen-year-old male with a gunshot wound. The bullet is still in his femur. We got you. We're taking you to the hospital, okay? Do you know what happened? Loosen the strap, please! - How old is he'? - He hasn't told me. My foot! - How old are you? - My foot! What your full name? My foot! Please, I can't take it anymore! What's your full name? Loosen my foot. - Will you tell me your name? - Michel. Michel, you'll be okay. We'll give you some painkillers. I can't loosen the straps because you could bleed out, okay? This medicine will help with the pain. Okay, Michel? This will hurt a little. I can't take it. That's the best I can do, okay? Take a deep breath, man. Not enough ambulances are working tonight. They waited 40 minutes for help. Nobody was responding. Use the Fabuloso soap, so it smells nice. - I already did! - On the floor too? - And over there. - Yeah? Were you able to charge him? No, but it's not that he didn't want to pay. He said, "Thank you so much. You have no idea how grateful I am. I'd love to buy you all a coffee, but I have no money. I'd like to give you something for caring for my son, but I really don't have the means." We didn't make a single peso. Absolutely nothing. We actually lost money. We used our equipment, bandages, saline solution, medicine, splints, oxygen, gasoline, the use of the ambulance. We offer our goodwill transporting patients, and then just wait around for them. There's no way around it. Soitgoes. It's cool to see a car crash, a gunshot wound. I like all that stuff. It's exciting. I don't like seeing people get hurt. But in the end... a doctor is a doctor because he likes dealing with sick people and surgery. There's a reason for every line of work. If no one got sick, there would be no doctors. If no one died, morticians wouldn't eat. If people didn't litter, there would be no garbage-men. All these things create jobs. That's the truth. If there were no idiots, Manuel wouldn't exist. What did you say, dickhead? Nothing, dickface. One of the EMTs was a total shrimpo, Jessica. I swear, he was tiny. What! Are you kidding me? Don't call me that. You're the tiny one. I'm a handsome young man! You're old. You're a twentysomething already. I'm 16, so what? Seventeen. I just turned 17. Maybe it wasn't a blade that pierced the skin-. It could've been a screwdriver. So you'd say it was a puncture wound? Dad? There's no hot water? - What? - We don't have gas? No- Atziry! Come here. Take this. But I'll be gone all day! I'm out until 9:00 p.m. This is all you're giving me? Give her another 20 pesos. That's not my problem. This is your responsibility. Josue', give her 20! - Don't you have any money? - No. - Why do you work then'? - Last night was a bust. You don't even pay for my school! Give her 20 pesos! Just 20! - Lend me 20! - What about my lunch? 20 pesos! Look, I have like 100 pesos. Just four 20-peso bills. How much is that? Guess it's gonna we a sponge bath. Are my pants in the dirty laundry? They're not here. Why didn't you go to school? No school, no ambulance. - Hey! - Don't start! Same shitty excuse every fucking day! - If no one takes me? - No school, no ambulance. Fine by me. Be an idiot. If you ad to get up at 7 am. to buy a motorcycle, you'd wake Dad up at 6 am. A month ago... I was the first one to wake Dad up! That was once! This is your life. Don't you get it? What will you tell your kids or your girlfriend? "It was my dad's fault, he was a fucking loser"? That won't put food on your table. Don't be an idiot. Those who want to study bring their notebook. You'll see... Look, I don't give a shit. I make my own living, but this is your life. Nothing you?re saying makes any sense. - Is that the guy? - No. Yes, it is. Stay right there. Hand me all the paperwork. What papers, Fer? It's just one of those folders. There are a bunch of papers here. Look at all these, here it is. No, that's not it. It's a folder with all our papers. You were sleeping! - I know where I keep things! - Then give them to me! If you have them, then where are they? Stop screwing around. Don't be such an idiot. Where are the fucking papers? You need to take this serious. - I am taking it seriously. - Then hand them over! Where did you leave them? You had to show them yesterday! You should have put them away. They'll impound the ambulance. This isn't a fucking joke. We're not playing with Barbies. This isn't ping-pong. We need those papers! This ambulance feeds us, so stop fucking around. Yeah, of course. If I get anything tonight, I'll definitely give you a cut. Count on it. Alright? I need to get it together. I need the money, man. Where the fuck is my charger? See you, suckers. Corner of Agustin Melgar and Vasconcelos! It's a Z-4. On your left, taxi! Keep moving, taxi. Still no ambulances on the scene! Move to the left lane. We'll beat them because they turned back there. Get out of the way! Move to the right! Move! Stick to your right! We could be saving your family! Listen to me. Move to the right! Let me through! You idiot! Get on the sidewalk! Look, here comes Tawi! Careful! I'm going for it! Signal with your hand. - Put gloves on! - We can make it! They fucking beat us! We're gonna win! Close your back door! Slow down. Let him win. You're going to crash. Move to the left, taxi! Let him win. Stop playing his game. This is about to get bumpy. - You bitch! - Careful! Watch out, be careful! Take it easy or we'll fishtail. There they are. Here I go. We're coming! Come this way, dear. - What happened, dear? - I got headbutted. - Who did it? - My boyfriend. Where is he? He ran off? Is this expensive? - Do you have medical insurance? - No. Nothing? Who do you live with, sweetie? With my mother, but she has no money. What medical coverage do you have? I don't have any. - Your job doesn't cover you? - No. We need to contact your family. Please don't. They'll fucking freak out. Calm down. No need to swear. Sorry. Calm down. Everything is going to be okay. - Where do you live, sweetheart? - I don't want to tell you. Listen, your nose is broken. It's fractured. These injuries are serious enough to send your boyfriend to jail. We need to call your family. Please give my colleague a phone number. - We can't leave you here. - Can you do me a favor? Can you please give me a hug to calm me down? Of course you can have a hug. Calm down, sweetie. - Everything will be fine, okay. - Yes. - What's your name? - Andrea. Andy, what do you do for a living? Nothing. Nothing? Don't you study? I'm in high school. High school. How's that going? Okay, I'm alright. I'm going to clean you up. Relax. Close our eyes. Is this really expensive? What? Is this really expensive? It is, right? - What's your name? - Andrea. - Andrea, let me call someone. - Yes. Will you give me a number'? Yes. Hello, are you Andrea's mother? My poor mom. This is Juan Ochoa. I'm a paramedic. Let me explain. I need you to stay calm. We were driving down Baja California Ave... Your daughter's boyfriend hit her and ran off. He hit her really hard, and she needs an X-ray. Her nose is broken, and her lips are swollen. If you can afford a private hospital, that would be the best option. Okay, no need to worry. Call back if you need anything. - Is this your bag, sweetie? - Yes. I'll put it here next to me. - Do you want it on your lap? - No, it's fine. I'll sit here so you can see I'm not going through your stuff. Where does she live? She wouldn't say, but said she'll get here quickly. The mother sounds fancy. -Fancy? - Yeah. - You're 18, right? - Yeah. Handle it inside. Yeah, but inside. We've completed the transport, which you authorized. We told you that as a private ambulance we charge for our service. I already know that. Just tell me how much it is. Pass the price list. It was an urgent transport: 3800 pesos. It's on the price list. And if I don't pay? We waited there 30 minutes, and no government ambulance came. That's why I called you. Enough! Just shut up already. No government ambulance ever showed up. Cheap fucking people who won't pay. Yeah, but we can't push it. They could go complain to the cops. That girl would've been left on the street without us. Close the door, it's cold. I don't understand why people get so upset. If I were in an accident, and somebody helped me, I'd pay. "With pleasure. Thank you, here you go." It's like asking for free tacos at a taco stand. How are they going to buy meat? It makes perfect sense to me. What do you think? Ready? Is it clean? - Which one? - The middle finger. There you go. 220. It's not too high, but... - Have you eaten? - No. Take your medication. You're going to have a heart attack. You need to understand. Fix your hair a little! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13. Thirteen to two. Okay, my turn! Watch me beat you! One... One, two, three, four, five, six. Six. You beat me! The cops have been breathing down our necks lately. "We re inspecting your ambulance to see If you comply with protocols." The oops and their fucking protocols! I'm so over this shit! Where was this? Same place they screwed David. But another cop spoke up and said, "Who cares about protocols when they're the only ones helping! Why would I ask for paperwork when there are no other ambulances? Yeah, they've been messing with us too. We were pulling a guy out of a wreck, and the cop there was a fucking dick. He said that without a government ambulance there, it would be my problem if the guy died. - He really said that? - Yeah! Did he let you take the patient? He had no choice. No one else arrived. He just wanted to fuck with you. - He even called a tow truck! - Why'? To impound us, because he felt like it. That's really intense. We need to be extra careful, Fer. If our work depends on those license plates, we need to do everything we can to get them. I'm serious. It's like a taxi. You're screwed without the right plates. And with proper plates, you won't have trouble working. Then we really need to save up for them. No more breakfast, lunch and dinner. Only two meals a day. Let's spend less, use less gas. We've gotta be thrifty. If you want to eat, it's two tacos and a soda per person. Hell yeah. And that's it! You want to eat like a king, but that won't fill us up. Tiny fucking tortillas, man... Tiny fucking sandwiches... It's not enough! Get it? Now is not... Wait, wait! Now it's not about what we like to eat, it's about filling up. If we don't make any money... How much will you spend on a can of tuna? How much for tuna? It costs 15 pesos a can. Maybe 20, 15... We can buy five. Five cans of tuna! Three cans... It'll be awesome. They cost 13 pesos. Get two! They only cost 13 pesos. That's only corn. Let's get these. Get more. - We don't need two. - Get two. No, man. Stop messing around. Josu?! - We still need 23 pesos. - I only have 20. You've got money. Why can't you pay? I don't have anything. Come on, they're waiting! - You have money, Dad! - Where would I have gotten it? You low-life mooch. See you! I'm going to go eat! You forgot your corn! Where does tuna come from'? It's camel meat. It's fish! See what happens when you skip school? We need an ambulance. Give us the address and the reason you need assistance. We're on the corner of Mexico Ave and Sonora Ave. - Be careful! - Get ready, Fer! Ready! Hop the fuck out! Okay. Stop moving! - Ready? - Let's go, Fer! Here I go! Where are they? Wait! I'm conning! Help me load the patient! No, wait! Get the kid! Ready? There are two people, Juan. Which patient are you taking? Ready? One, two... We're taking care of her! You take the other one! ...and three! Ready, sweetheart. One, two, three. Let them do their work! Ready? I'm switching sides. Help me out. Ready? One, two, three. Help me with his neck. Hey asshole, what's your problem? - What health insurance do they have? - Public insurance. I don't know what hospital. Magdalena de las Salinas. - Magdalena? - Correct. I just need their social security numbers. We're good to go! Officer! - Hey, no! - No? We don't need a police escort. - But they were asking... - No, the commander said we're good. - But their commander is telling me... - No. Gus? Sweetie, stay awake. Gustavo. Gustavo, can you hear me? Stay awake, my love, please... Stay with me, Gustavo. - Can you hear, honey? - Yes. Your son is going to be okay. Okay? Your son will be fine. Manuel, check the female's condition. The minor is the priority. Locate all of his injuries. I'm with him now! - Manuel! - What? Have you checked both their injuries? I'm working on the kid! What's hurting, dear? - Ma'am... - Yes? We're here at the government hospital, but there are a lot of ambulances. I don't think they have room for more patients. I'm being honest. This is the situation. You can't see from the stretcher, but the hospital is full of ambulances. Okay. What should we do? You tell me. You want to try to get him treated here, or-- No... I think the closest private hospital is Los Angeles? It's very expensive there. I can recommend something similar, but much cheaper. I think there is one that has pediatric trauma care... - Where? - In Polanco, I think. That would be much too far. If you want a private hospital, let's go to one. - Is my husband here? - No, he had to go file a report. - I recommend going to a private... - Whatever is best for my son. Okay, let's go then. We'll go to... To Mardan? It's good there, right? Sure, that's where they rebuilt my leg. We are going to Mardan Hospital. Agreed? Okay then. -Mom? - Yes, my love'? Where's your hand? Right here, honey, but it's strapped down. I'll give it to you soon, okay? Eleven years old, right, Gustavo? El Gato has one patient. Freski, one. Dedo brought in three. Barbi, one. Imperio, three. Plus these two patients makes five, man. Here you go. Sign here, please. Damn. Finally some progress. Thank God. Son of a bitch, we have to pay that fucker. - Who'? - The cop who just called me. - Papi? - Vallejo, Vallejo! - What's up, man? I've been waiting. - I'm here, I'm here. Here's 100. I'm paying for two. We still don't know if the woman is staying. I'll circle back in a little while. It's 300 pesos for each patient, right? I'll be in touch. Throw me any accidents you hear about. Sound good? Okay. Listen up, Fer and Manuel. Fifteen hundred divided by four is... 375 pesos. And then we paid 75 each. That's 300 each, okay? Of that 300, take out 50 for food. That's 250. - Then this last round... - Yeah'? ...we each owe 77 pesos. It was 467 in total. Minus 77. That makes 173 pesos each. - Okay? - Okay. - How much did I give you? - Thirty. Minus 30, that's 143 pesos. Manuel, you owe me 35. No excuses. For what? We all need to pitch in for oil, gas and Vallejo's bribes. Two tortillas, nice and crispy. You know how I like them. - Is the salsa very spicy? - No. I'll take that to go. All together. Why aren't you at home getting ready for school? - I don't have a backpack or pens. - There you go again. They don't grade you on your pen or backpack! Don't you get it, man? You always have a fucking excuse. I forgot how to live. I forgot how to live... Your singing sucks, man. I'll play another song for you. I'm here with a patient with respiratory problems. The patient can't breathe well due to a chest injury. And the police won't let me take him to a hospital. We're not robbing anyone, chief! Here's our paperwork. We have authorization from his mother. That's all we need. Saying you're going to arrest us is completely different than asking for paperwork. What're you gonna do? You think you're the shit? Stick to your fucking job, bitch! You're just here to extort us! Do your job, fucker! You fucking thieves! Fine, take me in. Let's go. Just leave me here! You didn't read me my rights! Fer! Call Internal Affairs... and tell them these police arrested me without cause. - What happened'? - Huh'? Nothing, man. Did the cops take his necklaces? Fernando? Did they take his necklaces'? Dad, what did they tell you? This is the new administration. Now every cop is demanding a bribe. That was the end of our money. How's it going? You just need to get everything on this list. Just write it down, and I'll try to get it all. Soft and hard neck braces. Small, medium and large? What size are these? "Esmal." What does "esmal" mean'? Small. Head stabilization supports? Yes. - Automatic defibrillator? No. - Yes. Yeah, but we don't have the charger. We need both a fixed and a portable oxygen machine. Yes. On the list it says portable or fixed. - And fixed. You need both. - No, no, no, no. Read the sheet, don't be a dumb-ass! Well, make sure because we can't miss a single thing. The cops just make up all this bullshit. Now when we get to an accident, they say our ambulance can't be more than ten years old. First the license plates and now this ten-year rule. You've gotta be kidding. Not even government ambulances are that new. All their ambulances are from 2006. - Right. 2002. -2003... No ambulance is 2008. Not a single one! Okay, Jessica. Listen to me. That's what you think, but you're wrong! Okay? You can't just take my phone whenever you want. The way you keep putting me on the spot with your parents makes me want to tell your dad so you get in trouble. Don't give me your passwords or your Facebook login. Why don't we try trusting each other for once? I won't look through your Whatsapp or your Facebook, alright? Let's leave it there. Sound good? Well, that's what I want. I hope you can respect it. It's called privacy, Jessy. Let's respect each other's privacy. Z-2? Let's go. Fuck you, man! You're so fucked, you pig. Fuck off! Your fucking ambulance sucks! Move out of the way. Gray car, move. Baby. Maxi. He's just tired. He's not asleep. What did you do to him? - Nothing, he's fine. - He's not responding, man. What's going on here? He's not responding. You reek, you're high. You think it's okay to do that while holding your baby? I can smell the glue on your hands. You have a baby to take care of. He's not a toy. He's completely unconscious. Maxi? Baby? - Where's your wife? - At the bakery. - Which bakery? - La Esperanza. We sell gum and candy. - Why isn't the baby with her? - She's with all the other kids. And then security arrived... And they got aggressive so... Maxi. There we go, little guy. Stay calm. What if he hadn't done that? No, he's fine. There's nothing wrong with him. Right. baby'? Stay calm, little guy. Stay calm, my sweet boy. Everything is fine. That scared the shit (nut of me- I thought he'd stopped breathing. This could get you in a lot of trouble. Do you want your kid taken away? This is child abuse. You need to take care of your son. I know you don't have any money. Look, he lifted his hand. Easy, my boy-- Let's leave this guy here, right? If I take him, it'll make things worse. That's what I told him. They'll take his baby away. - Where's his mother? - At La Esperanza bakery. Watch your step. Where's the bakery? - Over there. - Where? He's taking the baby to the mother. That'll be better. Fucking people. Son of a bitch. Poor guy. I'd love to take just one night off to show people how screwed they'd be without us. This city would be a mess without private ambulances. Where's Josu?? Is he already in his cubby? Son of a bitch! I told you to check the tank. You said we had enough! Stop being such an idiot! Now we have to waste time getting fucking diesel. We look like a bunch of idiots! - But you're not helping! - You're the fat one! You need the exercise, not me! We're totally broke, man. We haven't made anything in three days. Our ambulance broke down. We just left the mechanic. Can you lend us something for gas? Yeah? You'll give us a hand? Cool. Are you at the funeral home? Okay, I'll head over. Thanks, man. FUNERALS Let's go. Remember me when you're in heaven! We need something good tonight. You feel sick again? No. I'm fine. Get out all the trauma equipment! It doesn't look good. The big bag! Give it to me! One, two, three. Lift. Grab her hip. Get the heart monitor! Please, get in. Severe head trauma? Here, sit in the middle. Over here, Fer! Traumatic brain injury. This is serious. Get in or she'll die! Or we'll leave you behind. Let's go! - What's the patient's name? - Sonia Aguilar. Hit it. Pass me the oxygen meter. I'm on my way with a patient in very critical condition. Do you copy? Arrival in three or four minutes. She's critical. Get everything ready! Take a right here! Move, taxi, move! Go against the traffic. The middle lane! I need to let him pass. The stethoscope, Juan? What's your relationship? - She's my daughter. - This is serious. When we arrive, sign everything so they can treat her quickly. It's a private hospital with better care and specialists. - How far did she fall? - Four floors. She fell four floors! Four floors. That's ten meters. Move to the right, motorcycle! Move to the right! Motorcycle, move to the right! And stay there! Pull to the right! To the right! Come on, motorcycle! The fall was from four floors. Ten meters. Hello? We'll be there in three minutes. We're at the roundabout. Arrival in three minutes! Keep going! To the left! To the left! All the way! - The other lane! - Too late. Get them to move! Come on, get them to move! Move out of the way, bus! We have a critical patient. Patrol car, make them move. Help me move them, officer! We have a critical patient! Move out of the way, bus. We have a critical patient! Move, bus. We have a critical patient! Let me through. - The light is green now. - All okay? They're waiting for us. Let's go, carefully. Please get out and fill out the paperwork. The straps! Were you asleep? We got there before the police. The patient had fallen four stories. She was in critical condition when we arrived. We ran into the garage of the building, and there she was, gasping, bleeding from her ears. We got her in as fast as we could, but she died on the way to the hospital, Jessica. Her mom can't stop crying. Imagine! Four floors! So crazy. Sorry to bother you. We're about to head out. So, we are a... a private ambulance. There were no government ambulances. So, I need to charge you for the transport. No, it's not right that you brought her here. The closest hospital was Metropolitano. This is very far from our house. But... Can you help us with just 1500 pesos?
