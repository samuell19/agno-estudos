Five bucks. - Cocky bastard. - You want to make it a hundred? I thought you lost all your money.

Look, I'll lend you some money. - He's not answering. - Probably out chasing some woman. - Better pull in the next one. - What do we use for money? I got an account. Okay? You're the boss. - G'day. Where's your dunny? - Down the side. Fill her up, thanks. And give us a couple of your flags. - Here we go. 10 dollars 50. - Thanks, mate. Get it off me mate, will you. But I thought he said... Ten fifty. - Hey, listen, have you got a distributor cap that'd fit that thing? - Yeah, hang on. Let's go. Get in. Get in, you silly bitch, what you think you're doing? I'm going to the ladies if you don't mind. - Here, this is the one. $18.50 the lot. - Let go. What the hell were you doing? - Why didn't you try and stop her? - I was trying to work out what you were doing. - He never paid! I'd have given you some money. - If I take your money I'd have to listen to you talk. - He's after us. Step on it. - Stop you'll kill us! I can't stop, he'll have reported the petrol. To hell with the petrol, they'll have reported the car by now. - I'm in a stolen car?! - Well, sort of. I'm in a stolen car! With two lunatic drivers! Help! - Stop the car! Stop the car! - Go, you bastard. Will everyone stop giving me orders? - Let me out! I demand you let me out! - Shut your face! - Don't you talk to me like that! - Get her off!

Don't be so nosy. You're not. Well, I would like to know why she walked out. I think I'll get married. You could do it really well, with wine and flowers... - ...music, and all the trappings. - Yeah, well not for me thanks. Well, it seems to me that if you never commit yourself to anyone... - ...or treat anything as important then... - Then you tell me, Shirl. Then you're no better than an animal. - Well you just cost me 2 bucks, so what's that make you? - What do you mean? Well, hotshot here reckoned you wouldn't be a virgin by Wanganui. You didn't.

It's no good, I can't. - I feel it here. - Where? You take the money, hitch. I'll decoy. You'll make it. Cut 'em off at the pass? There's only two ways to fix your guts, Blondini. - One, ditch the car. - No way. Then drive it to Invercargill. Right. Well, we'll have to get rid of the exhaust. Blondini... Through what? What a way to go. I wanna go to the dunny. That ought to get rid of some weight. - How long do you reckon they'll be. - Oh, dunno. Don't reckon they'll even get this far. You'll go blind. Gidday. Er, give us a banana milkshake. With an egg in it. And a Gold Pack. - Banana? - Thanks. - Hi George. - G'day. Oh, this came for you about an hour ago. Hey! Hey stop! There he goes. C'mon, Gerry, the cops are here. Oh. Sorry. Gerry! Let's break. Here you are. And now I musn't reveal my secret identity. Are you Gerry Austin. No. Blondini. Must be the other one. Here we've got one of them. You hang onto him, I'll get the car. I told you we shouldn't sell the flags. - Where's your mate going? - That way. Like that, is it? They got a gun in that car. Down! Blondini! After them! Let's go! Get in! What? Get in you stupid bastard, I can't get any speed with you up there. No, man, I'm riding the bitch. You're gonna break your stupid bloody neck. Come on, you buggers. Wankers, wankers, wankers. Oh, Gerry, your stupid fantasies. - Stop. - You hit the car! - He's dead. - Come here! He's still breathing. Get on the radio and call an ambulance. - Go on. - Move it! It's all yours, Blondini. Gerry. Come on, don't mess me about. I hate to interrupt, but your car's on the run. Piss off. Goodbye pork pie. Hi! Bring the car up. - Quick! Help me with the body. - Don't touch him. It's a boy, he's not dead. Shift the truck! Shift the truck! Come on, shift the truck. Lighten up. Fast! It's overweight. Only one of us now. I'm taking this bloody car... ...to Invercargill, boy. Like you say, Groucho... ...nothing half-arsed. - I think there's only one of them now. - What happened? - I think one of them caught it. - Oh, shit. Right, take your positions. You there, you over there. Travel right back. We must have this area clear. - First kill, asshole? - Everybody right back, please. - Break to four. - Come in. Bird on 4 with a word on some action on dead centre. The cops are aiming to bury the Blondini gang. Everybody get right back. All you people are gonna move now. Move, move, move! - You gonna splatter his brains all over the car, son? - Just get out, will ya? Come on, keep on going. Keep on moving back. Come on now. Okay. Ready. Aim. Fire! Put a speed on. Let him through, let him through! He's here. Gidday. - What have you done? - She heard some noise out the back. Surprised? Pleased? Oh, boy. He's not in the car. He's gotta be here somewhere. You take that place. That man is in there with my sister. God, he's got a hostage in there. You men, hold your positions. Al right, Blondini. We know you're in there. We have the building surrounded. There are police at every exit. Put down your weapon and come out immediately. Gotta be coming. Come on Blondini. Release your hostage, and come outside with your hands over your head. Don't make things any worse for yourself. Hey, Sue. We've got visitors. Are you decent? I love you. No, not you. You're a nice looking boy though. Hang on, hang on, ladies first. Er, Sue? I guess I'll be paying for this ride.
