Let's take a walk to the next stop. I don't think we have been lucky here too. Are you coming or not? I know those insults are mine. But I don't want to hear them. So kindly insult me in your head. We don't want the baby to hear them either. Boi, a train is coming! Yes, I heard it too! Finally! Are you stopping? Yes. Let's wait for it here. No! The train doesn't stop here. We have to catch it at the other end. What! Yeah, I know it's annoying. But c'mon, we don't have to miss this one. Hurry, Hurry! - C'mon, hurry up. - I'm trying, Boi. I'm trying. But do you think we can make it? Yes, if we keep up the speed. It arrives Boi, stop it! Stop! Stop! Boi, stop the train! We missed it. Are you okay? Don't touch me! Don't you dare touch me! What has come over you? You have! You have come… all over me! Where are you going? I'm going home. It's a very bad idea. So please don't. It's a very bad idea. So please don't. There's no help in that village. There's no help in that village. Come and let's go to your mother Stop the train, stop the train; you couldn't! But, that's not true. I did. Okay where is it? Let's go, let's jump on it now. Look at me. I'm already tired. You asked me to run, I did not say anything. I ran. I lost breath, but continued to run, trying to catch a train that we were just going to miss. So are you blaming that on me? Whose fault is it? Is it not your fault? We should have stopped at Pona. From morning, we've been going from one train stop to another. Now Look at us! The baby could have come any moment from now. What would we do? That train was for us, Boi And now we've missed it. Look; I understand. You don't understand! Don't you ever say that; you don't understand! Ok fine! We should have stopped at the station. But we couldn't stand at one place forever. We had to keep moving. Is that my crime? Fine! You too fine! Besides, I've seen women give birth several times. I can handle the baby popping up anytime. You caused this! We should have left on the market day; you said no! Train, Train, please come and hit me. I am tired. Please, come and kill me. I'm tired! What is this? I'm tired! It's not for you. I have no plans of serving you water since you want to die. It's for the baby. I like how the baby drinks water. You're right. I can't feel your pain. So, obviously, I don't understand you. But hey… you're not alone. We're in this together. You don't have to give up now. Especially in this condition. We'll go home to your mother. You'll give birth, and be happy. Hey, you don't want to know what's happening out here. So, you better stay calm. Or else, you'll get on the wrong side of this woman, and your day will be as rough as mine. Is it hurting? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. Boi... I'm sorry. Who are you? Boi? Where am I? Boi? Who are you? What am I doing here? Boi, if this is a joke, it's not funny. It's me, Atswei, your wife. My wife... Am I married? Boi, you can't do this to me now, what's wrong? It's me Atswei Boi? It's me, Boi. I'm pulling your legs. You scared me. I should kill you. Sorry. Wait till we get to Akete first. Then, I know you're safe with your mother. What's wrong? My stomach I think the baby is coming. What! Ok. Let me get you some water. My heart... I can't breathe No! no, coconut water Coconut water! Where do I get some from? Coconut! Coconut! I need coconut water. Where do I get that from? That makes it even! You are evil! I know… That's why you married me. C'mon, let's go. Ah, you're so annoying. You forgot something? Did you call me? What for? I just asked a question. No, I mean earlier. Did you call me? Is this where you've got? You are hearing voices? I thought I heard someone call me. It's the baby. Boi? I saw it. Where are you going? I'm sure it's just a rat. Let's keep moving forward. Keep moving forward? Yes… Forward ever, backward never. But I'm scared. I have your back. C'mon... Okay, you go; I'll follow. What? Let's keep going. It's gone now. C'mon, ladies first. Go ahead. Are you sure it's still not in the bush? Okay… I'll go first. Just do what I do. What was that for? I didn't know you were also scared. I'm not scared! You scared me. Oh! I'm sorry... Next time prompt me before holding me. I hate surprises! You know. I'm going to go first. No touching! Run! Do what I do. Run! Boi? Mm? My mother is going to kill you if she finds out how far I've been running with this stomach. And I'm hungry too! No, she'll be happy I'm giving her grandchild.. You think so? Your mother wanted it more. Not as desperate as your mother. She asked first. So this one is for her. The next one is for my mother. This one must be a boy anyway. We need more men in the house. No, I want it to be a girl so I can name her after my mother. Oh! It would make her smile before she dies. - Ooh… When is she dying? What? - I'm joking, I'm joking. - Well, then I missed that joke. You're too tired to notice.. Are you not the one that put it here? Did? You could have resisted me, if you didn't want it. Like you'd be pathetic. My parents wouldn't want to meet you. Exactly! Especially your mother. I'm not even excited about meeting her anyway. Always yelling for grandchildren. You could even see her intestines when she yells. Oh, don't you know? I'm shocked. I don't even care what she says or does anymore. I hope you'll come back alive after giving birth What do you mean by that? She's my mother; is she going to eat me? She talks too much. Listen... Boi! Look, look... My mother has a good reason for everything she says.. Not like yours who just talks because she wants to open her mouth. Granted… But, not like she is in competition with old age. See who's talking about old age. Your mother is in a second phase of her menopause. Wooh… That's a lie! Don't your realize the number of men that chase her? She's so annoying! Always screaming and shouting like an old witch! Hold on. What did you just say? What did you just say? What? Repeat what you just said. I said what? You called my mother old witch. I didn't. Yes, you did. And that offends me. I need an apology. Really? So, you can be offended. Are you more sensitive than I am? You started calling my mother names. And when I do the same, you are offended. You see? You see what you're doing? That's exactly your mother. Is this what you want a girl for? To take after you and your mother? Never! I'd rather hang myself before she's born! Then you will die! I won't wait to have another version of you and your mother. I wonder if this is what my mother did when she was pregnant! On a second thought, I forgive you. My mother said pregnant women are always frustrated. This is it! One day, when our child is old enough, I'm going to tell this story. And if it's a boy, I'll give him all the reasons why he should never be as stubborn as his father. I'm sure you must be hating me right now… Let me show you something fun. You know I don't come this far and retreat? Your baby saved you. So naughty... Atswei, hurry; come and see. Do you see that? Is that a house? Of course, it's a house! But I see something else. Food, food, food! I see food! Is it that you're not hungry? I'm hungry! So how come you just saw a house? Can you smell that? I can smell it. Aren't we lucky? But we don't know them... We don't need to know them. It's food we want; they'll understand. There's a baby to feed. Ah! Aren't you coming? But we can't carry all the things with us. Let's find somewhere to hide them, or... I was thinking exactly the same. We're beginning to think alike. This is strange. And there are only two houses. Knock, knock! Are you sure there are people here? I've never been here before. Or, have I? Knock, knock! Maybe we should go close to the door! What do you want? What do you want? Good day... You live here? You have... beautiful houses. They look like palace for kings and queens. What do you think? She thinks so too. What do you want? No. We got lost, we are sorry. We're leaving now. Oh no, no... That's not true. We're not lost. We missed the morning train. And we came here to find food, while we wait for the next one. You missed the morning train! - What are you doing? - Heyyy! You're not allowed to do that. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Welcome, my lady... We've been expecting you for long. Excuse me! She's my wife; not your lady. And you've not been expecting her. We came here on our own. Can we usher you in now? In where? Well, a place has been prepared for your arrival… Food, shelter, clothes, everything! Not forgetting the little one. You're mistaking. You're not expecting me. Your highness makes no mistake He's always right. Will you stand there and do nothing? You'll be fine, my lady… I'm sorry. my dearest! We'll be out of here very soon.. They are not even harmful. Let's enjoy whatever they've prepared for whoever they are expecting. You disgust me! You'll thank me soon. You bet on it. [Incantations...] Please, wait. My lady... Here is water to clean your hands and feet. Water to clean my hands and feet? Yes, my lady. What nonsense? Please, she doesn't mean anything… Forgive her. Calm down. You're not talking to me. We're not here to clean up. We want food. There's food in abundance. You need to be purified first. I'm not doing this. You don't have a choice, my lady. You have to. Heii, easy. You don't need to scare her. Shall we carry on now, my lady? I'm not your lady. Stop calling me that! Yes, stop calling her that. She's my wife, not your lady. I'm sorry, my lady. Do you people understand anything at all? Don't worry, you'll be fine. I'm here. [Incantations...] Your hands please… Careful… it'll enter my mouth! You're now ready, my lady. You'll be taken to your hut, where your meal has been served. This feels like home; don't you see? Thank you. Enjoy your meal… Not everyone does. Of course, we will! After me… These are our best meals. We prepare them once a year for our special guests. We are happy to serve you with them today. There's a seat for you too, my lady.. C'mon, let's hurry up with this, we don't have all day. Is anything troubling my lady? No. She's fine! I think some music will do… I'll excuse you. Erh, you're delaying. Boi? I don't feel right about this. This doesn't make any sense. It makes sense, my lady. I mean my dearest. They've mistaken us for their guests. That's what it is. It makes perfect sense. Shall we finish this and leave before we miss another train? It's obvious you're enjoying our meal. Very much; very tasty. This was carefully made. Yes, it was. I would like to enquire why my lady is not eating the meal. I'm not hungry. She's hungry, don't listen to her. I'll package the rest and take away. She'll eat later. My lady... You have to eat. Your highness will not be happy to hear this. Can I ask? Why are you people only concerned about my wife and not me? She will labour soon. How do you know? Wait… Let me ask! How do you know? Well... It's obvious she's pregnant. We've had women come here with this condition many times. We do our best to ensure the baby is safe and ready for delivery. He's right. Do it for the baby. My lady, you have to eat. I don't like how you keep using the baby to get me do things against my wish. Or, don't I have control over them anymore? Of course, you will, but after the baby is born. C'mon, eat something... a little Train! Quick, quick, quick! What are you doing? We're leaving. Leaving? Yes… That's our train, calling. No, no… There's a misunderstanding. You are our guests. There's no misunderstanding. We have a train to catch. Your guests will arrive soon. Yes, she's right. We're not your guests. Your highness is never wrong. He said you're our guests. He's wrong this time. Stop trusting him. Thanks for the food. I enjoyed it. Wait! Ok… Can I inform your highness, at least? He may want to say bye.. Be quick! You think we'll make it in time? We will. It didn't sound close. He's not coming. Let's go. Exactly what I'm thinking. C'mon... You cannot leave, my lady! No woman leaves here with unborn child. Excuse me? We didn't come here to birth. We came for food. We gave you food… You took something from us. You must leave something for us… the child. Is that a negotiation? No… Your highness does not negotiate. It is a demand! You're crazy! You want to take away my child He ate your food, not my unborn child! Hey, hey; be patient. No one asked you anything. It is a prophecy. Your highness is coming soon, my lady, to initiate your labour. It'll be quick. This is what we'll leave for you… Boi? You broke my muzik! Never mind… Run! [Incantations...] Faster… A little faster. You can do this. C'mon Do it for the baby! Oh! What are you doing? Are you walking? I'm doing it for the baby! It's tired and wants to walk! Noo… The baby can't be tired. Boi? You'll bury me on this ground if you keep forcing me to run. You have a plan for another train? If I did, we wouldn't be here. You sometimes can be stubborn. That's when you don't listen to me! Who's not listening to whom? It's always about what matters to you. I'm always in your blind. That's not true. Tell me what it is then. A lie... You see? Not even a moment to think about it. It'll never happen! What!...Wait... Are you speaking a language I don't understand? I don't speak in tongues. You know what? I'm done. I'm also done... Talk to me when you want to be understood.. I'll talk to you when you want to listen. Fine! I'm not the only married man in this world. I don't need to suffer this. You see? Exactly what I am talking about I can never have a mature conversation with you! Fine, you're on your own! Even better. No, no. You can't have the last word. Wait! Don't think you've made a point. Never talk back at me the way you just did. I won't take it! Don't make that face at me when I'm talking to you! Ah! Is it a crime to impregnate my own wife? What's the problem? Look. Don't try those pranks on me. Straighten your face. What's the problem? My stomach You're hungry. You should have eaten that food. C'mon, let me help you up. Gently… I've got you. Gently… We have to keep moving. I can't… I can't. Come... Bring your hands Boi, Boi! Ok, ok. Sorry, sorry. Ok... Put your hand around my neck. Bring the other leg. - Bring it close. - I'm bringing it! Boi? Yes? You can put me down now. - You need some air. - Su-re? I can walk some distance. You need some air. Boi? Yes? Will you still choose me in your next life? We're almost there. I know. We missed it. I'll go and get the luggage. We'll join the evening train back home. We can catch the morning train to Akete tomorrow. We won't miss it. I'll get the bags. Huh? Atswei! Atswei, I'm here. I've got you... I've got you. Atswei… you're bleeding. It's coming. It's coming!

Is a train coming? The evening train will come soon. We'll be out of here. Hold my hand... hold my hand. Have I been a terrible wife? Noo... You're the best thing that has ever happened to me. You're special. And, will I be a good mother? There'll be none like you. Never, ever! - Don't leave me... Boi, don't leave me. - I won't. I won't leave you. I can't breathe... My chest. I can't breathe. Don't do that! Don't do that! Atswei... Atswei? Please try... try and breathe, breathe for us; breathe for me, the baby, for yourself. Try and breathe for all of us. Atswei, don't go please. Atswei… Atswei! Don't go. Don't go… Atswei… Atswei! Don't go. Atswei... Atswei... Atswei! I think there's someone in the way. What is he doing? It's a sign-down. Stop! Stop! Get off, hey! Get off the way... get off! Get off! Stop, stop! Herh, are you crazy? Do you want to get me into trouble? Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Do you want to kill yourself? Are you crazy? My... my wife. - Stupid! Fool! - My wife... My wife is dying! Help me… Please. Hey, there is somebody on the track. Wait, I'm going to find help. Gently, gently. Get me water, get me water! Water, water, water... Here you are... Will she be fine? Her heart beats. I don't know why she's not up yet. Muzik... muzik! She needs muzik. She needs muzik. How do you know? It's happened before.

The baby is coming. What? Let's get her to Akete hospital quickly. How soon can we get there? A little after three hours. Oh no no! She won't make it. What are you doing? I'm delivering the baby. What? Are sure about this? I don't know… What... what! I've seen my aunties give birth; severally and my sisters too. I'm just doing what I see people do. Tools… Hurry, get him tools, hurry… Push. Push. - Push. - Tools... Are those okay? Or you need more? Tools! Not these tools! - We can give you more. - Push, Atswei. You can try... you can try. Push… Tools… Puuush! Atswei, push!

To the new baby. - She looks like the mother. - No, she looks like the father. Who told you? I don't know. Did you see the father's hair? Hurry, Hurry We heard an old wizard lives across the fields. Old wizard… Yes. We even heard he eats babies. That's why he was banished. But don't worry, they said a spell is cast around his house; he cannot step beyond it. Let's go, let's go. Hey! Hurry, Hurry I didn't get any help! I didn't find anyone. Oh... She has a girl! Really? Let's go, let's go... What's your destination, husband and wife? Akete… Atswei?
