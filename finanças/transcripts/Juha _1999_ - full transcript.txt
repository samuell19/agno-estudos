SPUTNIK presents In a film by AKI KAURISMÃ„KI Based on the novel by JUHANI AHO They are happy as children. - Are you the daughter? - I am mistress of the house. Wife to that miserable old man? You're too lovely for that cripple. He is a good man, Juha is. Too old for you - throw him aside. Come away with me. It's badly broken. I'll get parts tomorrow from town. Not until tomorrow? You have a beautiful wife... Yes, she is handsome... And yours? I have no wife. Marja would not be mine had she not been an orphan in our care. I raised her from a little girl as my own. I could have had a farmer's daughter, but she was to my liking, though poor. Come away with me. You shall have whatever you like. Wait... I shall fetch you shortly. You shall grow old before your time in this wilderness. Your eyes dimmed, your hair grey, your shoulders bent. SOME WEEKS LATER We leave tomorrow. - Where to? - To city. For it is what you want as well. I belong to another... Juha. You are no more his than is a bird that he has caught and caged. I have gone away with Shemeikka because I love him. My heart is withering here and I cannot breathe. Forgive me and do not attempt in vain to find me. Your Marja You are tired... sleep a moment. Marja. Wait here. They have taken Marja... Unless she was taken away by force, the authorities can do nothing. Let's go. - Where is Shemeikka? - He'll be here soon. He asks that you wait. I am his sister. His sister... Oh, I am glad. - You are so thin... - How long do you think she'll last? - You're from out of town, aren't you? Why do you sit here in the dark? Come and let me introduce you. I fear your friends. Take me away from here. Take you away? You only just arrived. You're not enjoying yourself? The cruelest of pain does not frighten me and without grief I could not live When you live the time of cherries you will know the pain of love Do you think I'll support you forever? It's time you start working. Never! Who says you are better than others? You are with child. AUTUMN WINTER To the memory of Jaakko Talaskivi
