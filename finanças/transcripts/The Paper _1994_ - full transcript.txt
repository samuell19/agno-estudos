Yo, man, we outta here. See you later. See you later. That ain't a party, man. Yeah, that party tonight's gonna be slamming. Yo, what you wearing? I don't know. Better look good tonight, you know what I'm saying? That music is dead, yo. Those guys sleeping or something? Elevator music'll knock you out. Yeah. Hey, man, I wouldn't be caught sleeping here, not this time of night. Shh! Not around here. Think we should wake them up, or what? Shit, man! Shit! The fuck's going on, man? Don't touch it! No, wait! Come on, man. Run! All news, all the time. This is WINS. You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world. It's already 83 degrees in Central Park, working its way up to a downtown high of 95. At the top of the news this morning, racial tensions flare again, this time in Williamsburg, where two white, out-of-town businessmen were gunned down outside a restaurant, a racial slur spray-painted on their car, in apparent retaliation for the murder of a black youth last week in Greenpoint. Police are said to be searching for two suspects. Keep your radio tuned to 1010 WINS for updates. 1010 WINS, all news, news whenever you need it, because your whole world can change in 24 hours. WINS news time, 7:00. Nice pajamas, Henry. Mad at me? Why should I be mad? Guy gets home from work at 4:00 in the morning. Why would that make anyone mad? Scale of one to 10. 4:00 a.m. in the morning! That was about a seven. Japanese automakers insist there's no way out... Why don't you just pour battery acid down your throat, Henry? No caffeine. Well, Daily News kind of kicked your butt today, didn't it? "Welcome to New York, you're dead." Ah, they got that? Mmm-hmm. How'd they get that? That happened out in Brooklyn at midnight. I can't believe this. Did Newsday... I don't wanna... Did they... Did Newsday? Don't show me. They got it. I don't wanna see the Post. What do you guys have today? Oh! "No parking except for me." Really, Henry. McDougal's gotta go after the poor parking commissioner again? Good shot, though, isn't it? Oh! That's great art! Look at that! Sandusky double-parked in front of his office. Hon! Look! You're missing it. Parking commissioner of the whole city, double-parked, no ticket. And as a New Yorker this doesn't enrage you? Sweetie, it's horseshit! I know it's horseshit! We tried to get the damn Brooklyn thing, but Wilder won't answer his beeper. He's up there jerking off or something. Oh! Oh. You okay? You never really appreciate bladder control until it's gone. Oh, boy. Sorry, hon. Ooh, look at that Sentinel headline. See? This kind of stuff is just shameless. "Nepal premier won't resign." That is, uh... They're just trying to sell newspapers. That's sensationalism, Marty, and I won't be a party to it. I miss everybody. Say hi to everybody for me. Everybody except Alicia. Who else do I hate? You're not gonna go nuts again today, are you, hon? No, no, no, no, no. That was a one-time thing. I've got a million projects. I never even get to finish a book when I'm reporting. Or the baby's room. I really want to get to that dresser. Yeah. I gotta go. Now, if you weren't making a sacrifice, too, that would be different. That would be a lot different. I know. You gonna call me later? Wear a tie for the interview. And promise me you won't torpedo it on purpose, okay? Why would I torpedo it? Henry, you know those days that can change your whole life? This is one of them for us. For good or bad, it can happen either way today. So, you know, don't blow it. I'm not... I gotta go to work. You're not taking my car! You parking fascist! You tell Sandusky we're not gonna take it anymore! Goddamn parking cop! Towed my car three times. Yeah, I know. That's brutality. Henry? Henry, I gotta... Can we... Morning, Phil. Is it just me, or are our lives becoming a nightmare? What have you got for me, Henry? Donald Trump jumped off a building, landed right on Madonna. And then they all went to Elaine's. This guy's sticking with that story, huh? Yeah. He's a real yo-yo. There's already another... Hey, Lou. How you doing? How you feeling? How am I doing? You wanna see the bruise on my leg? Aw, you'll be fine. Hey, Wilder, you really did do... This is nice. What's the plural of "ultimatum"? Yes, yes. I don't know what happened last night. Don't complain. They already called the air-conditioning guy. Alicia wants to see you before the staff meeting. She's the managing editor, Henry. "Ultimatums" or "ultimata"? - Both. - She's not going away. Smart guys say "ultimate." We're gonna go with "ultimatums." You say ultimata, I say ultimatum Hey, uh, what's the matter with Phil? Looks like he sat on something sharp. Well, you told him he could have Richard's old desk, right? Right. And now you promised it to Carmen. Are you completely psychotic? Well, I have episodes. Nothing serious. Phil is still pissed you wouldn't approve his $600 orthopedic chair. And now, with this desk thing? He's convinced it's a conspiracy to prevent him from sitting down. Hackett. Hello. Henry, it's Alicia. Oh, hi. Alicia. Alicia? Listen, I want to see you in my office... Alicia, is that you? - Because I'm having a hard time hearing you. - Henry? Henry? Are you in the tunnel or something? I can hear you perfectly fine. - Yeah, there's a lot of static. - Henry? Hello? - I can't... I'm losing you. - Henry! - Henry? Henry! - Are you in the tunnel? I can't... Can you? - We can't hear you. - Henry? Hello? Hey! Okay, hey, you know, call... We'll see you when you get in, okay?-Hello? Hello? Okay, all right. Okay. All right. I love car phones. What, are the presses running? Yeah, Sunday travel section. Here, sign these. Tell me what you want to do about Phil. Who's that? That's McDougal. What the hell's he doing? Sleeping. He says he can't go home. Somebody wants to kill him. Hey, Mac! Mac! - Who's trying to kill you now? - Sandusky. The parking guy? Over a couple of lousy columns? My columns aren't lousy. Geez, give it up, would you? Man, can't you get it out of your system? So they towed your car. They scratched it up a little. Hey. $6,000. $6,000 damage to a vintage automobile. Okay, you're ranting now, babe. I bust my ass to find something fresh, and when I get it, I bang it like a cheap drum. People love this shit. You should read my mail. Hey, turn that scanner down, will you? How in the hell you supposed to sleep around here? Gee, gee, what are these? Oh, subway wreck, West Fourth Street this morning. Did you find the one with the... Is that an arm? Oh, yeah, you found it. Aw, you know, don't put these on my desk in the morning, okay? Not until I've had three Cokes, okay? Morning, Kathy. Hey, Henry. Henry? Three Cokes, then a picture. That's the rule. What? You know what's going on in Fort Greene? Two dozen cops hassling anybody with a black face and a record on this Williamsburg murder thing. If there's gonna be a riot, which I think there is, then we should have somebody there. Unless, of course, you wanna get stomped two days in a row on the same story. "Get stomped two days." That's funny. Doesn't anybody say "good morning" anymore? I don't think so. Williamsburg, huh? Uh-huh. That's, uh... That's Wilder's territory, isn't it? What, are you trying to bigfoot him? Wilder? Oh, yeah, he really aced it last night, huh? Come on, Henry. I know this neighborhood... Okay, forget the desk. She can have the desk. But give me the chair, for Christ's sakes. Phil, I was talking to somebody. I can hardly stand up straight, Henry. Okay, you know what? Go do that. That's a good idea. And I'll handle Wilder. Don't worry about it. Thank you! What are you guys gonna do to Wilder? Nothing. We're not doing anything to Wilder. Come on. Look, Henry, you don't know what's it's like to live in pain. It does things to you. It... Ow! It changes you. I'm sure it does, Phil. I wanna talk to you about those changes, okay? Rub some... Look... Keep all the bullshit away from me today, okay? Because I've got a really big decision I have to make, and I just... I just need some time to think about this. What? About the job at the Sentinel? How do you know about the job at the Sentinel? Bernie told me. Bernie knows? Aw, man. It's a newsroom, Henry. I know it's none of my business, but do you really wanna count pencils uptown? Is that you? Boy, sometimes you can just smell a horrendously shitty day on the way, can't you? Just don't chop the living shit out of this one like you did with the nun thing. Look, it's early. Let me look at it. I really like this... Hey, this jerk on the phone wants a correction on the quake story. You have an early proof from yesterday? Oh, come on. Why don't you say that every morning? Hey, Bernie. I hate columnists! Why do I have all these columnists? I got political columnists, guest columnists, celebrity columnists. The only thing I don't have is a dead columnist. Ooh. And that's the kind I could really use. Right. Hey, listen... We reek of opinions, Henry. You know what every columnist at this paper needs to do is to shut the fuck up. I'm serious. Listen, can I talk to you for a second? Because I know... If you don't mind walking. I gotta walk before I die. Why? What's the matter? You don't wanna know. Well, sure I do. No, you don't. Bernie, if I said, "What's the matter?" I'm listening, so... All right, all right. I got a prostate the size of a bagel. Oh. You still coming? Look, Bernie. I know you know about the Sentinel interview. It's an assistant managing editor thing. You know, it's really more sideways than up. You know. You can jump in here anytime, by the way. What are you looking for here, Henry? You want me to make it easy for you to go to another paper? You want a ride uptown? What do you want? You want me to wait outside and think positive thoughts? That's not my job. My job is to keep your ass downstairs. Well, what am I supposed to do? You tell me, huh? I don't know. I don't know. It's 9:00 to 5:00. It's more money. It's less hours. Martha, you know, we're having the baby, and she gave up her job. So, it's for her, that's what you mean. Well, you know, not just for her. It's for me, too. Bernie, you've got kids. How'd you keep doing the job? Don't ask marital advice from a guy with two ex-wives and a daughter that won't speak to him. The problem with being my age is, everybody thinks you're a father figure, but you're really just the same asshole you always were. You do have a problem, Henry, but it's your problem. Thanks, Bernie. Been a big help. Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around Daryll! How you doing? Come on in. Hey, hi. Make sure she put on those sneakers, you hear me? Yeah. Daryll. Yo, Daryll. Yo, man, check this out. I don't wanna put... You gotta wear them, all right? What do you think's gonna happen? What does it say? Nothing. Damn. ...for the parachute. Hello? Henry? Why aren't you at your interview? Well, hon, it's not for another two hours. Hey, what's up? Janet told me you called. - Tell him to do it over. - He'll love that. What's up, honey? You okay? I mean, do you need anything? Not right away, I mean. Tell me what's going on there. Tell me everything. Leave nothing out. Oh, you know. Usual delights. Uh, honey? Can you... Can you tell me what you need? Because I got this meeting with Alicia... Don't take any crap from her, okay? Okay. I won't. Now, have you got anything? Last chance. Anything at all. - Water bed! - Water bed. Okay, honey. Phone's slipping out of my hand. No, no, no, wait. Stop, stop, stop. Okay, here it goes. No, no, no! I'll remember, I'll... Henry! I'll remember! Okay. You call me when you got it, all right? Okay. Goodbye. I love you. She's nuts. Alicia Clark. Give me a break. Oh, my God. Fred, would you let him use your phone? - They stole his radio. - Isn't that the parking cop? McDougal has got to be stopped. So how long do you think this is... Couple, three hours. Three hours? Geez. Hey, it takes time, chief. Hi. How was your meeting? Oh, it was great, great. Listen, do you have last month's phone bill? Oh, great. I want to talk to Henry first thing. Okay. Uh, your decorator called. She said the kind of wood that Bruno picked out for the chair rail was not included in the guaranteed price, and you're gonna have to approve another $600. Oh, unbelievable. Every time the phone rings it's $600. Also, Robert De Niro's office called. Oh. Bobby called? Well, his office. And said there are two seats left at his table tonight for the benefit. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. So if you want them, it's gonna be $500 a plate. Listen, tell them that we'd love to be Mr. De Niro's guests. Hit "guests." If they mention the 500 again... You son of a bitch. You promised me, Henry. For God's sakes, Alicia. We're not gonna ask some news reporter to wait until after 5:00 to make out-of-state phone calls. It's ridiculous. I'm not gonna do it. Okay, let's let them make free phone sex calls, too. What, you mean as a kind of bonus? That's not a bad idea. We can start with Phil here. Start what with me? You think my job's easy? You think it's fun firing people? Firing people? Is that what you're gonna start with me? Is it? Aw, Jesus, Bernie. Come on with the smoke. You know the doctor found nicotine in my urine again? Then keep your dick out of my ashtray. Oh, that's very funny, very funny. So... Two days after a black kid is killed in a neighboring community, two white businessmen named, what... What are their names? Hanson and MacGregor get shot up with racial epithets written on their car. Now, in response, The New York Sun decides to run a parking story. I... Keighley called me at 7:00 this morning. Yeah. I bet he did. Bless you. Joe, will you please cover your mouth? Metro. I assume we're all over the subway? Three pieces. A tick-tock, list of injured, search for heroes, standard transportation wreck stuff. We got any art? Yeah, Eddie picked up some nice spaghetti shots on this one. Love the severed arm shot. What about the motorman? They find him yet? Yeah, they found him drunker than a skunk in his neighborhood bar. Oh, God. He derails his train and steps over bodies to have a few beers? What do you do after you step over bodies? I have a cigarette and go to sleep. Okay. Here you go. We got an above-average bank robbery in the Bronx. That's good. An exploding hand grenade in Hoboken? What about something fun? Don't we have anything fun today? Nazis marching in New Jersey. There you go. Oh, yeah. Nazis are a barrel of laughs. Features. Oh. All right. Uh, we got Alison's profile of a teenage hit man. Uh, we got Grace finally done with that Hollywood, uh, who's-banging-who chart. And part three in our continuing saga on penile implants. Yeah, by the way, can we possibly get another dick drawing? It looks like a map of Florida. It also looks like, I think, the fifth at, uh, Shinnecock Country Club, doesn't it? Right out here. And I would play over the water, by the way, as a suggestion. All right, all right, all right. Business. Okay, Dow's up. Trade figures came out at 8:00. Nothing shocking. But I'm telling you, I'm sitting on Watergate out there on Staten Island. With the zoning commission thing. Listen! Jerry! If you guys could just give me a couple of city-side reporters... Wait, wait, wait. How's it possible that you always have Watergate somewhere? Listen, I'm... Piss off, Carl, I mean it this time. I got a quote from the commission chairman's ex-wife, and she's plenty ready to talk. His ex-wife? His first ex-wife. Oh! Oh, there's a reliable source. Yeah. Foreign. Terrorists blew up a restaurant in Paris, killing five. None from New York. Ferry boat capsized in the Philippines, drowning 300. None from New York. There was a violent coup in Bahrain... None from New York. Witnessed! Witnessed by two people from Long Island. All right! Yes! That's close enough. Oh! Henry, this might interest you. What's that? The mother whale in the Ukraine had triplets. Aw! She told me she was on the pill, for God's sake. Ah! Excuse me. I get any on you? Thanks for asking, Bernie. Okay. All right. So, page one, subway sounds like our wood, right? Yeah. We got great art. I think it's definitely the subway. I don't think so. I don't think so. Uh-uh. You know? TV's gonna be all over it. They already are. It's a minor derailment, first of all... And Carmen has got great day-two stuff on the Williamsburg murders. If they make a bust, we have to follow up on that. The subway's a major story. - Nobody died. - Bullshit. Somebody got maimed. Yeah, that helps. Minor derailment. All I'm saying is, people got maimed, and we have pictures of it. Let's go with it. Damn it! So we fucked up yesterday. What do you wanna tuck our tail between our legs and just take it for, do what everybody else does? Let's stand alone. Let's make up for it. We're a commuter paper. People want the subway. What are you, market research all of a sudden? Not everything is about money. It is when you almost fold every six months. Bullshit. Come on, come on. You two can slug it out at the 3:00. Let's wrap it up early, all right? Because Henry has an interview at the Sentinel. Henry! Thank you. - Hey. - Congratulations. Excuse us. At least steal us a little something, will you? What do you guys want? Tote bag? That'd be nice. Let me take some orders. Phil? Chair? That's not funny. Hello, my name is George Russell. I'm a reporter at The New York Sentinel. Hi. I'm supposed to meet Paul Bladden right about now. Map. So, I've been reading The Sun these past few weeks. Find it exciting. We're thinking of letting our hair down a little bit around here. Squeeze in some coverage of the outer boroughs. Nothing new for you, of course, but for us, well... We're the Sentinel. We cover the world. Right, right. So I've heard. Look, I won't dick around with you. I talked with Vince last night. He's gonna go with my recommendation. So, congratulations. The job is yours if you want it. Thank... Hey. Uh... Well, you don't look all that pleased. No. You know, I'm gonna have to think about that, because I haven't really... I have to talk to my wife. You understand. Oh, yes, of course. But I would like a decision first thing in the morning. Okay. And don't disappoint me. I think you're a serious newspaperman, Henry. Thank you. No, I mean it. You guys have got a cute little paper going down there, and sometimes you really pull one out. Thanks. It is... It is a cute paper. Kind of missed the boat on that one last night, though. Yeah, well... You know, I want to tell you, before I came over to this job, I hardly had any administrative, uh, experience at all. I had, uh, very minimal executive skills... Excuse me, you know, I'm curious. For instance, what would our, uh... Your, you know, Metro lead be tomorrow? Henry, you don't work here yet. Oh, you're right. You're right. Sorry. As I was saying about this book, um, I think it's something that you... You know what I'd go with? Subway. Don't you think? ...would find enjoyable. You know, though, that Williamsburg thing is pretty interesting. That's pretty tempting. Henry... You guys got anything on that? Henry. You do, don't you? It's funny, you can always tell, you know, one newspaperman to another... You can just tell there's something. What have you got? What do you guys got on that? Come on. They make a bust? No, I'd know if they made a bust. What are you guys sitting on? Let's just say that our coverage will be comprehensive. Gotcha. Comprehensive. I understand. Anyway, I'd love to borrow it. What? The book. Ah! The book. I got it right here. Nice, nice, nice. Yes, enjoy. I will. And, hey, thanks. You've, uh... You've been a big help. Now, don't overreact. If we go after it early before it metastasizes to a bone, the majority of these prostate cancer cases are beatable. Go after it how? Irradiation therapy. Well, that's fantastic. I mean, that's wonderful, because as it turns out, that's exactly the portion of my anatomy I'd like to see exposed to, uh, radiation. Um, you'll have to take an hour or two off work for each treatment, and we should start right away. How's next Monday? To burn a hole in my ass? Sounds good. Then I still have the weekend. Could you possibly be any more humorless about this? I don't believe so, uh, no. There is growing apprehension here at Kennedy among arriving tourists. Sir, can you tell me, do the possible racial overtones of what happened in Williamsburg make you think twice about visiting New York? My brother canceled his trip. Ooh! Big scoop from the TV guys. Pinhead's brother cancels trip. Does she think I can afford that? No, no, no. Come on. It's hardly Watergate. Your source is the man's ex-wife, for God's sake. Yeah, well, you try selling it at a staff meeting. I just had the shit kicked out of me. Deanne White, please. Yeah, Bernard White. Just tell her that it's her father. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, uh, okay, okay. No, I understand. I understand. It's just that, uh... Do you happen to know if she's free for lunch? I know it's kind of short notice, but, uh... Or dinner, or whatever, you know. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well, uh, it was just a shot, you know. Just a shot. You'll tell her that I called? Thank you very much. Stupid fucking thing to do. Actually, the first six weeks is no problem. The first six weeks you're so exhausted and you're consumed by these incredibly tedious domestic tasks, you have no time to get depressed. Oh! And after that, you have all the time in the world. I have tons of projects. Oh, you do? Like what? Like reading, for one. With a kid? No. I had projects. All the things that I wanted to do but never had the time? You know what my hobby turned out to be? Living Bob's life. I hung on his every word. I'll only be off the paper for six months. I'm going back. That's what I said, too, seven years ago. Oh, maybe I'm just being a bitch. No, you're probably just having a bad day. You didn't... You didn't drive into town, did you? I shouldn't be doing this to you. It's all... It's all manageable. The physical pain, the loss of adult contact, less money coming in, feeling worthless around people who work... All the crap. You can't even remember it the first time you look at your new baby. But? But he gets the baby, too, and he didn't have to... Fact of the matter is, once you have kids, a man's best work can still be ahead of him. But a woman's is very definitely in the past. I am so glad you called me today. Me, too. You know, Alicia, your husband's right. You should listen to him. Age has nothing to do with it. If anybody pushes their skin together, it bunches up. That's why it's called skin. Yeah, but it's the way it bunches. Your skin is the central preoccupation of my life. How much did this room cost? I can't afford this. I've got financial problems that make Russia look well-managed. This was the last time, Carl. I mean, you know... Really absolutely the last time. Okay. Yeah, but what about next time? God, I gotta get back to work. Boy, he had to go far into the hole for that one! - Police! Freeze! - Get down! What's going on? Nobody move! Shut the fuck up! Hey, what are you doing? Let me see your hands! I'm gonna blow your motherfucking head off! Get down now! Move it! Move it! We didn't do it! We were just walking by, man! You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. We didn't... You have the right to an attorney... We just passed by! We were just walking by! What are you doing? We didn't do anything! - You understand that? - Look, we didn't do... - Shut up! - You understand? So the dog was chasing the man, and the woman got hit with a shovel? For God's sakes, Alicia, you're the managing editor of the sixth-largest paper in the country. Now you... All I want is to be fairly compensated. No, no, you can't come in here every six months... I have other offers. Don't make me bring up the other offers. Does this have to be today? Do we have to do this today? I have pressures, Bernie. Real pressures. Oh, I see. Pressures. Okay. I know you loved running Features. I know Keighley shoved you into this overwhelming administrative job you didn't want. Yeah. I never knew how isolating it was gonna be. I mean, there are not exactly a lot of laughs around my office these days. Well, you're in management now. If everybody loved you, you'd be doing something wrong. Yeah, yeah. But the fact is, I think you're working miracles with the job. Exactly. I have 300 people doing the work they need 750 for over at Newsday. I know. Thank you. But there's no more money for you. There just isn't. Alicia, there's a ceiling in this business and you're hitting your head on it. Okay. Fine. My contract's up in 18 months. I'd like permission to start interviewing now. You leave me no choice. That contract leaves me no choice. I hope you'll pardon me saying this, and I know I'm no one to talk, but the problem isn't with your contract, okay? It really isn't. No way. No, no, no, no, no. All right, look. Let me tell you a story. Sit down. Sit down. Oh, Bernie... No, sit down. Won't take long. Very interesting. All right? Now, all right. In '68, a bunch of us that were covering the Olympics in Grenoble decided to go to the best restaurant in town. Now, the menu didn't have any prices, but we were on an expense account, so we just figured, "Fuck it," got drunk. Well... Somehow there ended up being, I don't know, 15 or 20 of us at the table, and when the check came... Whoo, it was $9,000. Geez! Yeah. Exactly. So now we're all starting to point fingers. We're trying to remember who invited who. We're talking about going to Western Union to get money cabled. And just when it was getting really embarrassing, this funny-looking old guy at the next table called the maÃ®tre d' over. Old guy. He drew a couple of squiggly lines on a napkin, signed his name, winked at us, and that was that. The old guy was Pablo Picasso and that napkin paid our bill. Well, I'm not sure I caught the segue here, Bernie. Well, I mean, the people we cover... We move in their world, but it is their world. You can't live like them, Alicia. You'll never keep up. Now if you try to make this job about the money, you'll be nothing but miserable, because we don't get the money. Never have, never will. So what can I say? Talk to Bruno about the, what, decoration, renovation, whatever. Ask him to be reasonable. Your husband's a reasonable guy. Or give up the nights in town Bruno doesn't know about. What? It won't lead anywhere good. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I know what I'm talking about. Okay. I'm gonna see Keighley tonight at the benefit. It's obvious that I'm gonna have to take this up with him directly. You go over my head on this, you'll only make it worse for yourself, believe me. McDougal. What, are you still sleeping? I went out for lunch. Get up. I need a favor. Oh, what time is it? Eh, five after 3:00. Come on. I need you to do me a favor here. You remember a... What is that, a gun? I told you. Sandusky's after me. When did you get so paranoid? When they started plotting against me. Henry! I've gotta talk to you right away. McDougal, how are you? Why? 3:07! Henry, I've got to know about that interview right now. Can it wait, hon? Because I've got the 3:00. No, it cannot wait. This is our marriage here, Henry, okay? What are you talking about? You walked in three seconds ago. When did, whatever it is, escalate to our marriage? Over lunch. You should have been there. Very enlightening. I've seen my future, Henry. I'm a bitter, nasty broad who can suck down a whole bottle of wine in a single gulp. Oh, honey, I... Just give me a second here, okay? Hey, do you remember Sedona Savings and Loan? They went under about six months ago. We did a big piece on them. I don't read this newspaper. Well, take my word for it. We did a piece on it, okay? Henry, if you got the other job, maybe I have a prayer. Yeah. Wait a second, hon. Do you still have that friend down at the Justice Department, Mac? Sure, but he hates me now. At least you'll be around to refill my Prozac prescriptions. Wait. Do you think you can get a list of investors out of him? 'Cause I will need to be medicated. Marty, please. Heavily. You know, a bunch of major investors. Guys who lost the most money in New York. - You know, Brooklyn, maybe. - Henry... They made a bust in Brooklyn. In Williamsburg. Two black kids. One 17, one 19. One of them did six months for felonious assault. But I'm telling you, they look like babies. This is a very poignant story. Marty, how are you? I thought you were on leave. - Hi. - Bust is no good. What? The bust is no good. Can we please talk alone? How do you know the bust is no good? I heard it on your scanner. It was subtle, but I know what I heard. Bunch of beat cops were talking about it. Then the dispatcher came on and told them to shut up. But not before they said they think this bust is totally cosmetic. Yeah? Well, whether it is or it is not, they're still gonna walk them at 7:30 and we need art, and please, don't send Robin. She's too green. If things get rough, she's gonna miss the shot... There she is, the Puerto Rican poacher herself. Who the hell told you to cover Williamsburg, sweetheart? Why don't you just calm down, Wilder, huh? Henry, you told me you'd handle him. Hey, let Marty talk to her husband. "Handle him"? All of a sudden you become 40 years old around this newspaper, you have to be handled, Henry? Well, if you'd answer your beeper one, two times a week, maybe you'd know what was going on. Oh, answer this one or two times. Hey, you know what? Williamsburg is turning into our lead. We could actually wood on this. Ooh, this is good. This is good. I want you both on this one. Okay, good, good. You got the cops, I get the poignant shit. I bought it! Why does she get the poignant shit? Bought the goddamn chair! This is the last straw, Henry, for Christ's sakes! "The last straw." What exactly were the previous straws? Now it's your problem, Henry! Hey, let Marty talk to her husband. Michael, I want you to go, I want you to call the cops. I want you to find out if the bust is good. I need to know for the 3:00. 3:00. What the hell's the matter with you people? 3:09! Who the hell took my stapler? I've been here a hell of a lot longer than she's been here. For that matter, I've been here a lot longer than you... Oh, for God's sake. You wanna cover Brooklyn? Then cover Brooklyn. But let me tell you a little something. You can't cover it from a bar stool in Manhattan. You see? That's the stuff I'm talking about. Just call the cops. Henry, I better see the $600 in my paycheck! I can't think about this now. Let me... From day one she's been pulling the same shit, Henry. Don't say that. Sit at a bar. This is a bunch of bullshit. I'm waiting! Christ! What was that? Let Marty talk to her husband. Please. Yeah. Cops. Maybe I can type up some fucking weather reports, huh, Henry, while I'm at it, too. - Just call the cops. - Just call the cops. You two take your time. I'm on the Sedona thing. God! I miss this place. Vinnie. Can you bring your creamy little friend along with you and join us? This heat is killing us. We got guys flying off the handle. When are we gonna be done here? Yeah, yeah. Couple, three hours, you'll see your breath. Honey, I've got like 64 seconds. What's wrong? Nah, that's... Well... Why don't you let me go to Justice for you? I got a much better contact than McDougal does. 'Cause you're on leave. Okay. I'll go anyway. So, how was the interview? Did he offer you the job? Not... Yes. You got any change? "Not, yes"? What does "not, yes" mean? It means, he offered me the job, but I said I'd have to think about it. A dime will do it. You have thought about it. I'd like to think some more. Why? 'Cause I have until tomorrow morning, I'd like to think, and that's the end of the conversation. Geez. Oof! You wish. Anybody hear a gunshot? Hey! A gunshot? Yeah, that was down at Alicia's office. Vic. I don't know what... Watch this. This is gonna be, uh... It's empty- Anybody around here respect a deadline anymore? Terrible system. Screwed up. Okay, tell me this. Have you ruled the Sentinel out? Please, don't be a reporter, okay? Don't worry. I'm not anymore. Let me give you a hypothetical. Can it be a short hypothetical? You're a professional tennis player. You love tennis, but you wreck your knee, and you can't play tennis again. Uh-huh. Your doubles partner, however, goes on and wins Wimbledon. How do you feel? Wins Wimbledon? Happy as hell. Couldn't be happier. Oh, bullshit. You hate him. Do not. I don't wanna hate you, Henry. Henry, they're doing it now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Coming. I... I gotta go do this. Okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you at dinner tonight. 8:30, Gus's Place. Your parents. Please, don't be late. Please. Marty, am I ever late? It's not funny. It's a little bit funny. Hey, see you. Give me a kiss. See you. Goodbye. Hmm? That's it? See you. Okay. "Deadline. A date or time before which something must be done." Sorry. Henry... It's a damn Marx Brothers movie every time I set foot in my office. One of our security guys actually tried to frisk me. Oh. We're having drinks later. What the hell was that gunshot? McDougal. - Is he dead? - I wish. McDougal's insane. The man is certifiable. Okay, before we go through the schedule, we still in love with the subway for page one? Yeah. No, no, no, no. Subway's ancient history. They made a bust in the Williamsburg shooting. Really? Cool. Two black kids at Fort Greene. One of them has a record. Everybody has a record. We have any art yet? No. So we'll get them at the perp walk. What's the wood? Uh, okay. Something simple. "Caught." Something like that. "Caught"? It's so boring. How 'bout something like, uh, "Gotcha"? There you go. Okay, great. I love it. "Gotcha" with a slammer. Oh, yeah. God forbid this paper ever runs anything without an exclamation mark. Hold on a minute, hold on a minute, hold on a minute. Hold it. It's not that clear cut. McDougal heard on the police scanner even the two arresting cops think this bust is bullshit. Now, let's think about this a minute. Doesn't that set anybody's alarm bells off? Yeah. Yeah, it... It could be like when everyone thought the Westies, uh... The union guy. The union guy. Exactly. Did you get anything officially from the cops? Uh, I am, uh, working on that. The other thing is, these deed guys were not your ordinary businessmen. They were on the board of Sedona Savings and Loan, and they lost a lot of money, millions of somebody's money, and the Feds are looking into that right now. So... Where did you get this? Huh? The, uh... This? I stole it off Bladden's desk at the Sentinel. I can't believe it! What? You stole it? Jesus, Henry, I was kidding. Well, you know, they called us cute, and I was right there, and they were out of tote bags. So... Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, Henry. Wait. You know, what are you saying here? That these bankers got shot up by some pissed off Wall Street guy? I don't know. I don't know. McDougal's on that right now down at Justice, trying to get an investors list. You got a cop quote? A, uh, what? Quote. You know, they talk, you write, we print. Oh, oh, oh. A cop quote. They got me on hold. Go there, talk to them and get me something. Working on the quote. All right, fine. Good. It's a great lead. We'll follow it up tomorrow, but without a confirmation, we still run "Gotcha!" Wait. What if these aren't the guys? What if they're innocent? We taint them today, we make them look good on Saturday. Everybody's happy. - Makes sense to me. - Taint them today. Wait a minute. This is a story that could permanently alter the public's perception of two teenagers who might be innocent, and as a weekend bonus, ignite another race war. How 'bout that? What do you say we think about this? Okay, what have we got? We got Nazis. - Give me a cigarette. - Okay, move it up front a little. Come on, Bernie. Listen to this. We're not talking about some publicity hound here who crawls into the cage and begs for this kind of thing. We're talking about two kids who may not exactly enjoy the whole prison experience. Oh, please, Henry. You don't care whether they got beaten up or not. That's not what this is all about. We got our ass kicked yesterday. So you wanna beat everyone else today, that's all. Yeah, I do. I do. You don't? Oh, come on. Give me a break. You don't? Tell me you don't. You do. Fuck it then. Let's not beat anybody today. Let's not beat anybody all week. Bernie, what do you say? Let's not beat anybody, uh, till October? The whole year? Fuck it. Let's never beat anybody the rest of our lives. Ah, glad you're not overreacting. So what do you wanna run, Henry? What? I don't know. Uh, what do I wanna run? Uh... "They didn't do it." "They didn't do it"? You don't have that! I don't think of these things. You don't have close to that. You have unattributed cops. She doesn't have "Gotcha." Something you read upside down. You don't have "Gotcha" either. Not for page one, not till you get a shot of the kids. So we're going on the perp walk. What's the big deal? So what time do they walk? So we stretch it a little. And you're gonna pay for that? Yes. We stretch the deadline to 8:00. If we get art on the two kids at the walk of shame, it's "Gotcha." If we miss them, the subway is page one. Oh, the subway's bullshit! Bernie, come on! Hey, hey! You don't have it. You know it. Now, you wanna run the story? You got five hours until 8:00. Go get the story. No, hey, hey, do your job! All right, you... Go ahead and do your job! Don't just take a position because it's the opposite of what she says. I mean, it's like watching a bunch of sixth graders, for Christ's sake! Photo. Where... Where the hell is Max? He went home sick. You make damn sure photo is at the perp walk, Henry. And I mean damn sure. Excuse me. Excuse me. What's up his ass? Bagel Anyway. Okay, so... You know anything about air conditioning? The problem's not down there. It's up there. - Where's Robin? - There. - In there. - In your dreams. Robin. Oh, fuck! Oh, shit. Shit, I mean, I'm sorry. Mr. Hackett, um, what's wrong? Nothing. Listen, Robin. I've got a really, really, uh, important assignment for you. For me? Yeah. This is big, okay? I mean, I don't wanna put any pressure on you, but I just wanna tell you that if you miss this shot, that means Alicia can't run the page one that she wants to. You understand? Uh-huh. Good. Yes! Who speaks Spanish? Henry. Sorry. I've had better days. Hey, Bern, please. Forget about it. It's coal into a furnace, Henry. I been doing this for 36 years. Every day you still start from zero, you know? Hey, Pete. Can you come here a minute? Go bother someone else. You okay? Nah. I'm in a foul mood. I gotta get out of here early tonight, so... Page one's up to you and Alicia, but, you know, play nice. I'll give it a shot. Well, that Sedona thing. Why does it have to be today? 'Cause "Gotcha" is wrong, and I don't wanna be wrong today. Well, hang with it if you want, but have Lou do a subway page one just in case. All right. I mean, we might get it. It's not even 4:00 yet, so... Oh, man! Good luck. Would you see what you can do with this? Hold on. Eighty-six Bahrain. They weren't from Long Island. I think it's fine. Anybody got another word for... Hey, Ed. Ed, you got Nazis. It's 9 inches. For Christ's sake, I don't have 9 inches for Nazis! Did Wilder call back? No. Do you have any change? No. You have no change? Oh, Henry, no! Check the... Henry, do you really wanna run "Smashed" for the wood on the subway? Eh, whatever fits. I don't really care. Hey, Blaisch, you have any change? Got another word for "mangled"? The thing is it implies that he was drunk while he was driving the train. He could've gotten drunk afterwards. You're accurate, ethical, and I want you out of this building. Torn, mutilated, uh... I don't care. Mutilated. Mutilated. That ought to do it. Henry, haven't you got anything on the Sedona yet? It's a quarter after 6:00. Beep Wilder. Shit! Hey, Henry. You got another word for... Oh, I got another word for all of 'em. Get the hell out of the chair. No, don't change that. Oh, that's pretty good. I got it. That baby's over here. Oh, for God's sake. Hey, we're minutes away, okay? Henry. Look, I struck out with the cops. Look, there's something definitely going on down there, but none of those son of a bitches are talking. Where'd you go? Police headquarters. Michael... You gotta go to the precinct on this stuff! Of course nobody's talking at DCPI. Jesus Christ! Hey, Hen. I've got "Smashed" with a question mark. What do you think? ...Williamsburg, where the prompt arrest of two suspects in the brutal murder of the two white Arizona businessmen... Henry, I've got "Smashed" with a question mark. What do you think? It's not gonna matter. I'm not happy with this source. I took up a collection, and you can never ask anyone again. Ooh. Hey, did McDougal call in? No. No message at all from McDougal? I have no motive for lying, Henry. I'll tell you what, Henry. I'm gonna make a proof of "Smashed" with a question mark. I'll show it to you. I'm going down to Composing. I'll check it out there. Okay, I'll meet you there. Nice chair, Ray. My back feels great. Yeah, great chair. I got about two minutes to sub that Bahrain piece. Hey! Come on, guys, huh? Oh, it's not funny! Police discovered the bodies of two men sitting in a parked vehicle... Talk to me, Chuck. What do you got? Ah, it's old news. Carmen. Wilder whiffed with the cops. Get out to the 9-1 in Brooklyn and get to the bottom of this bust already, all right? For tonight? You want this for tonight? Give me a break. It's only... 7:00. What do you think? - Well, I hate it. - Me, too. What's this? What happened to "Gotcha"? Artwork's not back yet. Perp walk's not for another 10 minutes. Bernie wants a backup. That's what we've got. We hold the page one till 8:00, not a minute more. It's 12 grand every half hour we wait. No problem. Those are union drivers waiting out there, mister. Okay. "Those are union drivers waiting out there, mister." Shoot it! What time's the arraignment tomorrow? Deanne. Just give me a second, all right? It won't kill you. What are you doing here? I came to see my daughter, and it's good to see you. Oh. My God, I don't believe this. You're married. You're married. Oh, my God. I have to sit down on this one. Look, I made it very clear. I don't wish to see you. Drop the rehearsed stuff, will you? You sound like you just walked out of your shrink's office. Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it. That was a rotten thing to say. Hold it, hold it. I'm sorry. Look... All right. Let me start over. Why are you here? Why? Why? I saw your name in that piece we ran on the Murray Hill trial. I was proud, Mrs. Whatever-your-name-is, and I wanted to tell you that. Okay? Thank you. You know... Let me just ask you this. Would you have cared to come if my name hadn't been in your paper? Do you hate me, Deanne? If you hate me, there's no point. I don't know you enough to hate you. It turns out that the guy they've been looking for, for 18 months, you know, this big search, has been dead for five years anyway. No! Oh, and he was something like 90 years old. So he couldn't have stolen a motorcycle and driven it from Kansas City to Ozone Park or something. That is so funny. Oh, yeah. I mean, that's just an example. I mean, I could tell you dozens of stories exactly like that. You could do a whole series on the Justice Department. Yeah. You know? People would like that. I bet they would. So, where's Henry tonight? Working. Mmm-hmm. Well, give him my regards. You sure you don't want some juice or something? No, no. No? You have another, though. Yeah, I think I will. So, Tom, did you bring the list? Yeah. Yeah. You can't take it. Just a look. I'm supposed to memorize every single investor in a major bank? You'll know what you're looking for when you see it. Hey, Martha. Yeah. Tell me something. Yeah. Did you honestly find even one of my stories funny? No, Tom, I didn't. Yeah. Just wanted to know where I stood. Well, you knew when I called, Tom. Yeah. Oh, my God! Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Kind of jumps right out at you, doesn't it? Justice! Justice! Justice! All right, everybody stay back. Just relax. Stay back. All right, just stay over there. Thank you very much. No, no, no, no, no. Beyond the barricade. Hey! Excuse me! Can I just... Uh, excuse me. Um, New York Sun. Hey, hey! Go around. I'm sorry. Can't you see the cable? Sorry. I'm sorry. - There they are! - Here they come! Daryll! Daryll! Daryll! Damn it! Shit! Hey! Do you have anything to say? Shit! Could you make room? What do you think your chances are? Get out of the way! Get back. Get out of the way! Hey... Hey... Come on! I'm down here! - All right, let's move it. - Party's over. Henry? Carmen on 4. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Nothing, Henry. I'm sorry. I can't even get into the building. I mean, they're not talking to any reporters. I mean, the guy from the Sentinel, he's standing over there and he's crying. No shit. Oh, man, Carmen. You're killing me here. It's 20 after 8:00. Wife line. Oh, geez. Hang on, Carmen. I'm not late yet. No, no, the Sedona thing. I got something for you. You did go to the Justice Department. Aw, Marty, this really ticks me off. What do you got? I saw the investor list. I'm reading it. It's just your average bunch of Wall Street schmoes. Trusts and stuff. Names I don't recognize. I'm thinking, "This goes nowhere." And then, all of a sudden, pow! "Pow"? Hold on. Hang in there, Carmen. Yeah? So? "POW." Sedona Savings' single largest investor, who alone lost over $5 million, E & R Interstate Trucking, Nicholas D'Onofrio, proprietor. What are you telling me? These banker schmucks lost $5 million of the mobs' money? "Dumbfellas," huh? "Unwise guys." Oh, hon, you are so good. You are so good. Oh, I love you. I love you. This is great. Do you know how good you are at this? I mean, you drive me crazy when you're like this. What are you wearing? Oh, baby. As fear of racial tension mounts, New Yorkers got their first look at the suspects in the brutal Williamsburg killings this afternoon, following their booking at police headquarters. Formal charges will be filed tomorrow at the arraignment, where prosecutors are said to be... God, we gotta get that cop quote. They gotta say it. Oh, come on! I drop a big, fat, juicy steak in your lap, and you ask for sauce? Hang on. Carmen, you have to get a quote. Henry, I can't even get past that desk sergeant. All cops wanna talk. They just don't know they wanna talk. You've gotta tell them. Henry, he took one look at my press pass and... You wore your press pass? Oh, you can't wear your press pass. Paul Bladden from the Sentinel on 6. Shit. Hang on. Paul. Hi. Can you hold on for a second? Thank you very much. Good. Marty, listen. This is so good, I'm running this tonight. You're supposed to be at dinner in five minutes. I can't help it. You're too good. That's how good you are. I can't... It's your fault. You actually got yourself into a jam here. Henry, listen. Tomorrow is fine. Tomorrow. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Today. Tomorrow. Today. Today, today, today. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Today. Now. Today. Now. Today. Henry. I'm on my way out at 8:25, and I just happened to notice that our presses aren't running, which strikes me as rather odd, since we are, after all, a newspaper. Gotta go. Okay. See you later. Listen, Carmen, just write up whatever it is you got. I'll get the quote myself. It's okay. It's okay. Hi. Hey, Paul, look. Look, looks like I'm gonna owe you one here, okay? Ninety more seconds? Can you? Thank you very much. First of all, you look fabulous. Cut it out. What's going on? Well, I didn't get the artwork back from the perp walk. Who'd you send? Robin. You sent Robin to cover the Williamsburg perp walk? Robin happens to be a professional news photographer. Robin happens to be Oh, see, now you're just being silly. That was a cheap-ass trick, Henry. Look, I'm on to something with this Sedona thing here. I just need a quote from the cops. You don't have it. And you screwed the story you do have. It's a fuck-up, Henry. It's a goddamn $12,000 error if you get the art back in the next 20 minutes, which I sincerely doubt. Okay. Bernie's not here, so this is my call. Wait for Robin till 9:00. If she makes it by then, run "Gotcha." If not, go with the subway. What the hell's the matter with you? Paul! You are the most unethical, unprincipled... I cannot believe you had the balls to do it! Slow... Slow down. Slow down. What... What are you talking about? God damn! You know what I'm talking about. The Sedona item. Why, you stole it right off my desk. Uh... "Uh, uh, uh, uh," my ass. Come on. You know you stole it! Well, hold on a second here, Paul. If we were working on a Sedona thing, how would you know about it? I mean, I hope the Sentinel doesn't have a mole over here. Did you or did you not take the item? Because, uh, gee, if they did, you know, they could get you in a lot of trouble for something like that. In fact, it might even be illegal. I'm not sure, but I can check on that for you if you want. Oh, come on, come on. Cut the bullshit. You know what? Why don't I do... Hold on a second. Janet! Henry? Get Dick Palone in the DA's office for me, okay? Just tell him I want to ask him a question. Don't worry, I'm gonna keep you totally out of this. Yeah, I just want to ask him a question, okay? I'll check on that for you, Paul. Give it up, Henry. Give it up. Our guy saw McDougal banging on doors all over the Justice Department. Now, I'm gonna ask you one last time. Did you or did you not take the item? Well, Paul, you realized you were talking to a journalist. Dick who? I realize, you know, this doesn't exactly get us off on the right foot. The right foot? Are you out of your mind? Why, the offer's rescinded. Uh... How stupid do you think we are? What did you think I'd come to when I put two and two together? Three? Three and a half? Paul, look, I'm trying to... And that you could walk in here... I'm trying to be reasonable here. If you'd just... Why don't you just, uh, take my wallet as well, eh? Let me say something! Wait a... Well, I hope you're satisfied, asshole! You just blew your chance to cover the world! Really? Well, guess fucking what? I don't really fucking care. You wanna know fucking why? 'Cause I don't fucking live in the fucking world! I live in fucking New York City! So go fuck yourself! You handled that well. Thank you. Martha? Martha? Oh, my... Oh, my God! You look like you're going to explode. Oh! That's how I feel. Oh! Where's Henry? Oh, running a little late, I suppose. No, right here, Ray. Like for E & R Trucking, what would we say? Uh, not an alias. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Good night, Henry. Good night. "Reputed mob front." We can say that. That's it. Way to go, Ray. Good, Ray. All right, I gotta go. Ray, it's a sidebar. Keep it tight. Henry? Henry, I couldn't get anything out of Justice. I told you my friend hates me. Now, why don't you send Marty? She knows that guy over there. Yeah, don't worry about it. Hey, does your friend at 9-1 hate you, too? Not for a good reason. Why? I got to talk to him. Hey, you know what? Pick me up in front of Gus's in about Henry, what's with all the grunt work? I'm a columnist. You're not a columnist. You're a reporter who writes long. Hey, grab a clipboard. Clipboard? I mean, I've got things to write here. You know, I've got my own stories I'm working on. Why don't you... Just get a clipboard! Henry! You can't leave until you okay page one. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. Working on it. Tell him to get a clipboard. ...civil rights groups and police officials. The mayor was optimistic that peace would prevail in the streets. The mayor remains in close contact with church leaders and activists in an attempt to calm fears of rioting and widespread violence Tonight, he will lead a solidarity march beginning outside City Hall and proceeding through Washington Square Park. The mayor will be urging New Yorkers to remain calm and to work with one another to get through these days without incident. Hey, he looks familiar. Never saw him before. Says he's waiting for a fight. A fight? A fight with who? None of your goddamn business. Turn it off, will you? Yeah. Hi. How you doing? Sorry I'm late. Hope you all ordered. No. We waited. Hi, Mom. Hello, darling. Dr. Hackett. How was the drive down there, pal? Made it in an hour and 45. Ooh! So, how's work? Work is, uh... Work is good. Oh, Oh, you liar! Martha told us about the Sentinel job. Congratulations, darling. Howard, let's get some champagne. The New York Sentinel. Now, that's what I call a newspaper. - Yeah. - Good evening. Have you had a chance to decide yet? Oh, Henry, uh, look fast, and then we'll fill in for you here. Sarah? Uh, well, I'd like to start with a small Caesar salad. I don't see it here on the menu, but I always just love... - Small Caesar? No problem. - Uh-huh. And then, um, well, I'll have with that small Caesar salad... Are you okay? And for you, sir? Henry? What's that, Mom? Oh, yeah. Okay, here we go. Uh, well, what I was going to say was, uh... You're probably going to find this a little hard to believe. You in particular, I think, are gonna get a real big kick out of it. I, uh... I can't stay. I have to put the paper to bed, but you know what I was thinking? What do you say, we all get together later and go have some dessert at that, uh, place? Are you kidding? It was a two-hour trip. Don't they even let you eat dinner now? And, uh, you know the other thing I was gonna tell you? Uh, I lost the Sentinel job because I stole the lead off the editor's desk. That's the other thing. I couldn't resist. They are so smug over there. Hon, they've got maps. They've got seating charts. The guys wear bow ties. No, no, no. You did it on purpose! What are you talking about? You did exactly what I asked you not to do. I... I... You're shouting, first of all. I know I'm shouting! I like to shout! Don't you notice? When I keep talking louder, it's because you haven't heard. Come here. I try to have a sense of humor about things, but all it gets me is a smile and a pat on the head. You don't listen, Henry! I do listen! You don't see! Of course I see. Hi... See what? How scared I am. I will be there. I swear to God I will be there. We mean more to me than anything else. You know that. Let me give you a hypothetical. Don't you know that? Really? Oh. A guy breaks into the apartment. Oh, breaks into the apartment. He's got a gun. He holds it to my head. He says, "Either I blow your wife's brains out, or I blow up the Sun building. "Choose now." What do you say? What do you think I say? What... What do you think I... It's ridiculous. It's not gonna happen. That is exactly my point, Henry. It is never one big dramatic choice. It is little, vague situations every single day, and you're either there or you're not. You keep waiting for the guy with the gun to show up, and it's gonna be too late. I will be there. I promise. Henry! 9:00! Let's go! What? You know, I mean after tonight, hon. I got... Martha, you would do the same thing. I saw you waddle off, eight-and-a-half-months pregnant, to chase the story. Henry! We're gonna miss this guy! All right. Wait! Hold on a minute. Henry. Come inside now. Come inside, sit down with me and have dinner like you said you would. Hon, come on. Don't take the bat out of my hand. It's the ninth inning. You know what this is like. I gotta get the quote. The guy's not gonna be there all night. I gotta get it. I have to. Okay? Why are you calm? Don't get calm. I hate this. Yeah, shout, scream or something. You like to shout. You should have just told me if we had a kid, I'd be on my own. You really should have told me. You won't. Two hours. Two hours, you hear me? Probably not even two hours. Hour and a half, okay? Martha. Come on. Honey, wait a minute. It's not even... It'll be two... Look, listen to me. Henry! Ow! Come on! Damn! Yeah, yeah, 99% of your time and effort goes into three basic things, your house, your work, your family. Well? Yeah, well, women in general, if you don't have a family. Or men or sheep or whatever you like. I made the leap, Bern. If you put 'em all together, the three of them want more than you've got to give, so what do you do about that? That's a tough one. Now, your family, I mean, they're people, and so you figure you can get a little human leeway there. I mean, you figure they'll... You figure they'll bend. But... So you crap all over them. Yeah, you do. You do. Freshen it up for you? Yeah, you read my mind. Listen. Hey, you. Bong! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh. Please. Please. Something. Anything. Anything in focus. Oh, shit! I am fired. Aw, Shit! Oh, oh, that's it. I got it! Well, I've been writing a book about my life, an autobiography of my days in the civil rights movement and other cases, and I hope it's a big success. Probably a movie. Well, we've gotten some... Ah, Gray. How are you? Hello, Cynthia. They sent me that advance yesterday. Talk to you next week. Oh, hi. Hi, Linda. How are you? Hi. How are you? It's good to see you. It's good to see you. I feel pretty good. Yeah. See you later. - Oh, excuse me, dear. - Graham? Yeah? Something I'd like to discuss with you, and I, uh, just didn't want to bother you with it upstairs. I feel an obligation to act on this directly with you because I think we have a good... Hi. I think we have a good relationship, and, uh, I would like to take it further. And I think, uh, the way to do that is face-to-face. You know, you and I, face-to-face. Alicia? Yeah? I'm gay- Oh, um... Well, I mean... wasn't... I mean, that's fine. Alicia! Yeah? I'm kidding. Oh, great. That was really good. Yeah, well, what's up? Well, I won't waste your time, but the fact of the matter is, I have other offers. Didn't we just renegotiate your contract? Well, recently, yeah, but my deal's up in just a little under a year. Eighteen months, isn't it? Well, um, technically, that would be more accurate, but, you know, with... Yeah, uh-huh. Well, I'll tell you what. If you have other offers, you have my permission to pursue them. But don't come to me again without talking to Bernie first. I don't like it. It's cheap. Okay? We done? Graham, I don't think you... I'd love it if you weren't here. I'm going to keep you as my bitch, boy. Word to my mother. Hey, I want those sneakers, man. What the hell you looking at, boy? How you doing, sweetheart? Man, I'm so scared. Don't talk. Yeah, what am I supposed to do? Stay awake. Here's your damn clipboard. And the next time you want office supplies, don't ask me. You keep the clipboard. Clipboard's for you. Hey, a clipboard and a confident wave will get you into any building in the world. Hi. How are you? Hey, Richie. Oh! Jesus Christ! You scared the shit out of me. Look, we gotta talk about this Williamsburg-Sedona thing. Oh, Jesus. I don't believe this. Come on. Let's go. I mean, everybody's on edge around here. Come on. Hey, at home, huh? I told you a million times. You want to talk to me? Talk to me at home. Look, we think we know what happened. Now, Nick D'Onofrio wanted to settle a debt, right? But his guys, they went and made it look like a race war. Now they got the neighborhoods all stirred up. Hey, you know what would happen to me if somebody saw us talking? So what's going on, huh? You guys looking at D'Onofrio? Hey, the dead guys lost his 5 million bucks. What's he gonna do? Buy them Giants tickets? Congratulations. You have a firm grasp for the obvious. Thank you. Then if you do suspect him, why are those two kids in jail? I ain't going on record. Who the fuck is this guy? We just want to know what you think. To characterize the arrest, what would you say? To who? To, uh, anybody. Wife. To your wife. You go home. And your wife says, "Hi, honey. How was your day?" What do you say? Fuck you. You say "fuck you" to your wife? You're not getting me fired over this. Okay. Okay. You know, if you're all right with "Gotcha" as tomorrow's headline, fine, 'cause that's what it's gonna be. See, me? I can't live with it. But if you can, okay. Thanks for your time, by the way. "Gotcha"? Right over a picture of the kids. Aw, come on! Don't run that bullshit. What do you think I'm trying to do? Look, I got news for you. I'm not locked up in the men's room with a cop because it's such a good time. 'Cause, frankly, I've had better times, okay? I'm here because I think the story's wrong. Is it? Is it? If you have something, give it to me now. But, you know, don't stand there and act coy and say, "Fuck you." Because, quite frankly, it's a waste of all of our time. And you know what. I don't have any more time. I have no more fucking time. I need it fucking today! I need it right now! All right. Richie. We just run what you guys give us, and you gave us "Gotcha." I didn't give you that bull shit! Downtown gave you that shit! All downtown cares is that you guys and the LA Times and the Tokyo whatever all run nice, fat, front-page stories about how we got the guys, and everybody can still come to New York with their money. Then a month from now, when the kids are cut loose 'cause of lack of evidence... I mean, they were just walking by, for Christ's sake. Turns out we don't even have a goddamn print on a murder weapon. When that gets out, you guys, you'll bury it on page 23. Nobody'll notice. Can you give me that on the record? Aw, stop the shit, will you, for Christ's sake? Bullshit! Do something. These are nice kids, Richie. They're good kids you guys threw in jail. Hey, these kids have bright futures. One of them's an honor student, for God's sake. The other one's a pretty good ballplayer. That's right. He's a tailback. He's going to Penn State this fall. Is that right? Oh, yeah. God, this makes me sick. Penn State, huh? Yeah, Penn State. Nittany Lions. You guys use my name on this, and I will fucking find you. You understand? Hey, hey. You understand? I got it. "Police department source" only. Promise. Right? These kids? They didn't do it. This is great. This is great! It writes like butter. I mean, there is actual butter coming out of my pen. The guy actually said the headline. He said the headline. He said it. He used the words, "They didn't do it." You got an honest-to-God exclusive, Henry. Alicia's gonna have to kiss my ass on this one. Come on, baby. Right here, baby! I gotta know if she hates me. I mean, if she hates me, there's no point. Hates you. Yeah. She's your daughter. What could you do that she would hate you? I kept fucking my reporters and broke her mother's heart. That'll do it. Yeah, it would. It did. Mac, I think we got room for 20 inches on this one. Give me a killer lead. By the way, you got three minutes. I need four. Three. I need four. All right. Whatever. Just make it fast. Lou, we're ripping page one for a new wood. Henry, I gotta talk to you. Pop "They didn't do it" as big as you can. All right, tell Composing I'm subbing one and three. Henry. Henry. Yeah. Main bar on three. 120 points. All caps. Really big. Henry. Henry. Henry! Slap an "exclusive" in there. Big, big. Henry, you know if we got these kids... What's the matter? Did you feel that? Oh, my God. They ran it. They fucking ran it! They ran the wrong fucking headline! God! I'm stopping it. What? We stop and replete. Go upstairs. Write up what you got. Tell Lou to send down "They didn't do it." Hey, Henry, aren't you gonna say it? You gotta say it. We'll use the same art they used for "Gotcha." Come on. How often do you get the chance? You can't just do it and not say it. Come on! I... Stop the presses! This guy! Hey! How do we stop the run? Who are you? I'm the Metro editor. How do we stop the run? We don't stop the run. I mean, if we had to. A guy breaks in with a gun, puts a gun to your head, how do you stop the run? Hit the kill button. Thank you. Hey! Hey. Hey, hey! You don't touch that. Where's the key? Nobody touches that but Chuck. Give me the key! Chuck's got the key. Give me Chuck! Chuck! Hey! Hi. How are you? This is working. This is working. Yeah. This is gonna work. Yeah. That's it. All right. Okay. Oh, yes! What the hell is going on? You sure you got authorization for this? I got authorization. How long will it take once we get the new plate in? Ah, 20, 30 minutes maybe. We gotta rethread the whole machine. Look, I'd feel better if I talked to Ms. Clark first. I told you. I already talked to her. You son of a bitch. You're not gonna stop this run. Did you run that? Did you run that headline? You're goddamn right I did. I got a desperate call at we are two hours past our deadline and nobody knew where the hell you were! It's wrong. It's 180 degrees wrong. We gotta change it. How far are we into the run? Uh, quarter of the way. Maybe more. There's 90,000 papers on the trucks already. Oh, no way. No way. We run what we got. It's wrong. Given the information we had at the time, the story's right. Yeah, but it's not right. I got a cop. I got a quote. It's wrong! Not for today it's not. Tomorrow it's wrong. We only have to be right for a day. This shouldn't be semantics. This shouldn't be money. People will read this, Alicia, and they'll believe us. We're The Sun. They'll take us with a grain of salt. We'll run yours tomorrow. No! No! Uh-uh! Not tomorrow! Right fucking now, today! You know, I bet you thought it would never catch up with you, didn't you? What? I bet you thought I didn't even know the shit you guys say about me. Oh, come on! What? You thought I don't get the bean-counter jokes? You think I don't understand your snide shit? You don't even have a college degree! Hey. You couldn't take the shit I put up with, Henry! You assholes think I don't know that you wait until I leave before you sneak off to the Bear's Head. Can't even invite me for a lousy drink. Look, you jerk, it's not about you or me! You never thought it would catch up with you. Well, fuck you, Henry. It catches up today. We run what we've got! Give me those fucking keys! Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me those keys! No. You give me those keys! Damn it! No! No! No! Get out of my way. Can you believe this? Are you all right? Okay! Hold it, both of you! Aw, come on! Give me the keys! Are you nuts? Somebody should stop this. Give me the goddamn keys. Ow! Henry! I'm sorry! Oh, God! Come on! Come on! Give me the keys! Get away from me! You goddamn son of a bitch! You arrogant bastard! Get away from me! You are so fucking fired. I'm fired? You... You can't... Can you start it up again without a web break? Uh, probably. Then do it. Yes, ma'am. Hey, Alicia. Congratulations. You have officially become everything you used to hate. Oh... What the hell's that supposed to mean? Oh... Hey! Hey! Come here! Hey! That's my car, you son of a bitch! Come here! God... Shit! Come back here, you... Oh, come on! Did you see that? Did you see that? You're a witness! God... Oh, shit. Son of a bitch. What's the matter with you? The car got towed. Again? Yeah. Want a ride? Come on. I'm not a leper. I'll buy you a drink. Thank you so much for the ugly spotted thing I got from two other people. What was it, on sale? I know you're in training, but would you have another drink with me? Oh, by the way, Bernie White's the name. Marion Sandusky. Sandusky? Yeah. Why does that ring a bell? What do you want me to say? You want me to say, "Good job"? You want me to say, "You struck a blow "for journalistic integrity today"? Can't do it. You abused your position to settle a personal score. It is what it is. Live with it. Henry was right. Oh! Cheryl, double bourbon up. What do you mean, "Henry was right"? Can I have Dewar's on the rocks, please? Henry was glib. That's all. Everything I used to hate. I mean, what does that even mean? I mean, Henry wouldn't even have a newspaper to work on if I hadn't saved it. Henry doesn't have a newspaper to work on. Oh, please! Now I'm OD'ing on righteous indignation tonight. Sandusky. I know I know that name from someplace. Common name. No, it's not common. I gotta go to the john. But we're not, you know, exactly the Washington Post, okay? No. No, we're not. We run stupid headlines because we think they're funny. We run maimings on the front page because we got good art. And I spend three weeks bitching about my car because it sells papers. But at least it's the truth. As far as I can remember, we never, ever, ever knowingly got a story wrong, until tonight. That's what Henry meant. Got any smokes? Yeah, what kind you want? Box is fine. You've been a long time coming But, darling Welcome home Hey, Victor. Oh, Mr. Hackett. What's going on? Your wife... They just went upstairs, but... Marty? Oh, God! Go, go, go, go!

Fetal heart rate's slipping down to 60 beats a minute. What's that mean? Gotta get her out of here. It's gonna be okay, honey. It's gonna be okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Yeah. Who's this? It's Alicia Clark. Get me the pressroom. Richard! Hey, big Mac, how're you doing? I heard you got a novel going. Who told you that? Hamill. Hamill? I didn't tell Hamill.

At the top of the news this morning, an exclusive story in The New York Sun reports the out-of-town businessmen slain two nights ago in Williamsburg were in fact connected to a New York crime family, which may now be implicated in their slaying. Local police have turned the murder over to the state's Anti-Organized Crime unit, and the black youths arrested yesterday have been released with no charges filed.
