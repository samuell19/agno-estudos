(Multicom Jingle) (bells brightly ringing) - Ah, this house has seen it all. I've lived here since I first married. The births of my first four children and the fun we had. But then my husband left. My kids grew up and they left too. And then I met the greatest man in the world and fell in love all over again. And then I got the surprise of my life. And we started a second family. And my oldest daughter started hers and moved in with us. So now we're just one big happy family. Well, I'm happy. (alarm buzzing) (gentle music) (woman groaning) (man groaning) Oh, yeah, good morning John. - Good morning. - Oh, look! - Oh my God, today's the day. - I know. The day I've been looking forward to for three months. I'm going back to work, I'm going back to work. - How can you like this idea. - 'Cause I want to work. And we need the money. - Well how's Robert gonna take-- - Honey, Robert's gonna just love it. - He's leaving his mother, going off to slug it out with other kids, that's-- - You get your son, I'm gonna get breakfast. - (sighs) Geez. - Oh Mom. - What? - Which one should Maggie wear for the first day, the pink dress or the overalls. - Do you think Maggie's gonna care? - Overalls, so in case some kid knocks her down, she won't skin her knees. - I didn't think of that. All those aggressive children. (John laughs) - Have you seen the way Maggie and Robert play? I think it's the other kids who oughta be worried. - Margaret? - What? - Camera, we need to get a picture of Robert going off to his first day of daycare. - Oh yeah. - I'll look for it, okay. Would you two hurry up. Do you want them to be late their first day? - Late? We don't want a reputation. Are you excited? Yeah, are you excited? Yeah. (sighs) They have no idea we're abandoning them. - Well, Mommy has to go back to work. Oh gee. Margaret has to go back to work. - Oh. - I can't believe I'm calling her Mommy. (engine revving) (horn honks) - Can you believe that? - I got ya. - [Mary] We should have gotten a roster on all of the parents, we could have called them. - Listen, I got that meeting this morning. You stay here and make sure everything's okay. If there's a problem, you call me, I'll be right down. - Okay, I'll be waiting on the curb. - Hm. - Ready? ♪ Sweetheart, I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ Let me hear you whisper ♪ ♪ That you love me too ♪ ♪ Keep the love light glowing ♪ ♪ In your eyes so blue ♪ ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ (birds tweeting) ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ Let me hear you whisper that you love me too ♪ ♪ That you love me as I love you ♪ ♪ Won't you keep the love light burning ♪ ♪ In your eyes so blue ♪ (Ann laughing) ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love ♪ ♪ I'm in love ♪ ♪ With you ♪ (Ann clapping) - Yeah!

Two years ago today, I pulled you over for running a stop sign. It's our anniversary. - Oh. You remembered this. - A good cop never forgets. - Well, you can arrest me anytime, hm. - However, I did have something else in mind. - Oh! Oh! Oh! (twinkly music) (Ann gasping) - Will you marry me, Ann? - Mm, two years, two years I waited for you to ask. I wanted to look good! Look at me! - Is that a yes? - Bet your badge on it. - [Nick] (laughs) She said yes.

They're awfully close in age. - Yeah, well the little boy is my brother. And the little girl is my daughter. - Uh huh. - And the man is my step-father. - And your mother is your sister. I saw this movie. (laughs softly) So, your husband couldn't come today, huh? - You know, I really think it's dangerous that you put your child on a motorcycle. - Tig is an experienced rider. - Well how experienced can he be, he's a child? - Have you ever ridden? - No. - No? Oh, there's nothing like it. You know, you should come with me sometime. - Yeah, well, right now I gotta call a cab and go to work. - I could take you right now, I mean-- - No, no, no, thanks anyway. - You sure? - Yeah. - It's no trouble, really. - No, I'm fine. - [Ken] No problem. (window knocking) (man laughing) (gentle music) - Boy awfully expensive restaurant for Nick and Ann to be taking us. - They have something to tell us. I think I know what it is. - What? - I'm not gonna tell you. In case I'm wrong. (John sighs) - You know, I think I'm gonna call Mary. Robert got the sniffles in school this afternoon. - Honey, it's just the sniffles. And Mary knows the number of the restaurant. - [Ann] I didn't see her car, - Can we afford this place? - They should be here. John! - Listen, Ann, please let me tell them. I want to do this properly. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine, properly. Okay. Mom, John, I'm sorry we're late. - That's fine. - Margaret, John. - Nick. - We have something that we would like to tell you both. - He asked me! (women screaming) - I knew it, I knew it! (women laughing) - So much for doing it properly. - I knew it! - She knew it. Congratulations. - Thank you very, much. - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, I have such wonderful wedding ideas. - Okay, yeah, Mom, this is gonna be small and informal. With just a few guests. Now we want to have it in June. In your backyard, just like yours and Johns. - Oh a June, June! That's only, what 12 weeks! Ah! On Annie, Annie, this is your first wedding with the family. I want it to be so beautiful. Now, the announcements I think should be understated. I'll write them. And I see the day as just full of white roses. And a harp player. - A harp player? - Ah. - We can still elope. - And somewhere Honey, a touch of teal. (Ann sighs) - What's teal? - I don't really like teal. - Okay I gotta go, (lips smacking). Okay kisses, bye, bye, (lips smacking). - [Child] I got one. - Hey, why don't you come see what I've made. I don't bite. (man sighs) (people chattering) So, what do you think? Do you like shelves? - Yeah, they're nice. - So did you think about my proposition? My bike. - Oh, the bike. Um, yeah, no, it wouldn't be right. - Lady, there is nothing more right than that bike. Come on. - What? What are you doing? - No, come on. - I can't do this. - Yes you can. - I've never been on a bike. - Well there's a first time. - All right, wait a minute. - Come on. You are gonna love this. - You let me go, I can walk. - Check this out. Scoured every part shop in the city. Built it from the ground up. - It's lovely. - Lovely? This ain't no hag rice burner, you know, this is a classic. There are 24 coats of hand rubbed lacquer on this gas tank. My lacquer, my hands. - It's great. - Sit on it. - No, I have to go to work. - Mind you this is hand stitched leather, it's very comfortable, come on sit. (engine revving) - It's nice. Now I really have to go. - Now listen, listen. Listen to this. (engine revving) You hear that? - How can you not? It's deafening. - You just don't get it, do you. - Get what? I sat on it, it's a motorcycle, can I go now? - There's only way to understand. - Wait a minute. You can't do this! Wait a minute. Let me off. Let me off! Oh my God! (man yelling) Please, just, just go slower! Just go slower! - You said faster? - No! - Okay. - No, please don't go so fast! - Isn't this great? - You know this is illegal. I don't have a helmet. - Don't worry, this cycle will outrun the cops. Oh now this is where you can really open her up. - Can, please, no! Stop! Please don't go fast! (loud rock music) (engine revving) Tell me you didn't love that, ow! - I don't believe you! - [Ken] Sheesh, you pack a hell of a punch girl. - That wasn't a punch. If I'd have punched you you wouldn't be sitting on the bike. Who do you think you are taking off with me like that? - Well, uh, just Ken Crawford. - Well just Ken Crawford. The next time you feel like hijacking a woman, - Yes? (Mary groans) (Ken laughs) (baby laughing) - No, no, no, please. Okay, all right, okay, okay. (Nick groaning) (Nick laughing) (Ann screeching) (baby laughing) - Oh no. - Oh no. - I still say a long floor length white formal. - Short dress, no veil. - And no tuxes either. (banjo strumming) - Okay, bath time. - Oh sugar. - Come on Robert. Let's go. - Mommy will be up in a minute, Sweet Pea. (lips smacking) The only thing that's going to match about the whole wedding is the tuxes and a white dress is so elegant. - Margaret, I just got the pictures back from Robert and Maggie, you gotta see them. They're great. Oh look. - Let me see, let me see. Oh, look at that. Look at that. - John? - Mm? - (laughs) I need a favor. I know there's been a couple of times you wanted to give me away. Well now's your chance. Would you give me away at my wedding? - I'd be honored. Thank you. - That is so sweet. - Oh, Mother, look at the pictures. (John laughing) - Oh, this wedding is going to be so beautiful. Especially if you listen to me about the tuxes and the dress. - Oh! - I, we have to call your brothers and ask them if they will be in the wedding. - He looks just like you. - Yeah. - I see it in the eyes. (door knocking) - Excuse me. - Wouldn't you say that? - Let me see. - Surprise! Oh. - Can I help you? - You must be the new one? I'm looking for Margaret. - Dad? - Come here, baby. - What? - You have grown into a beautiful woman. - Oh. (man laughing) - What are you doing here Richard? - I read the announcement. My baby is getting married. Mm. (lips smacking) I know haven't been much of a father to Ann, but you could have mentioned she had one? I'm very happy for you sweetheart. - Wow, I can't believe this. It's um, Richard, Dad. This is my fiance. Nick Lundgren. - Hello sir. - You'd better take care of my little girl. - You all right? - I'm sorry about the surprise but I did bring the bubbly. I think we all need a drink to celebrate. Margaret, can I have some glasses. - I'll go. - Richard Becker. - John Hicks. - Young. House looks great. Different color. - It's been over 20 years since you lived here, Richard, we painted. - Well it still feels like home. I miss it. - What, what's this about? - I want to help with this wedding. I've never done anything for our kids. And now that some of my investments are paying off, I want to help. - Well, is that okay Mom? (laughs) He is my father. - That he is. - Here's to second chances (laughing). (bright jazzy music) (bottle popping) Ah, whoa, whoa, where are those glasses? (laughing) (quiet somber music) (Margaret sighing) - You want to tell me about it? - I was just thinking about the kids. Ann, Ann was little. She doesn't remember. - Remember what? - When Richard walked out. Dennis thought it was my fault. Andrew started taking care of things most little nine-year-old boys don't have to even think about. Mary, poor little Mary, wouldn't even let her grandfather pick her up. (crying) - Honey, and you? - I used to cry myself to sleep every night after the kids were in bed. Oh God, I don't know how I got up in the morning. - Yeah, but you did. Look Honey, you have a lot to be proud of. You've got a new life. Robert, me. It's all different now. - Yeah, but-- - No, no, no yeah buts. It is, it's different. - Okay. (birds tweeting) - I'd love to stand up at your wedding, but as your future brother-in-law you have to let me throw the bachelor party. - Ah, you talked me into it. - All right (laughing). Yeah. - You know, I hate to break up this locker room chat. But one rule, Denny. No women or any variation thereof at this bachelor party. - I mean, what's a bachelor party without a stripper or two? - Kind of like a broken arm without a cast. (men laughing) - Ah, Ann. - Well. - Mom, would you tell Dennis that Nick can't have a stripper at his bachelor party. - Well, if they get one we get one. - Okay, see there. - Now, the lady from the wedding shop is waiting out back. - It was so much easier we were eloping. (doorbell ringing) - I'll get it. You go make wedding plans. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hello son. (laughs) Is this any way to treat your old man? - You may be old. But you're not much of a man and you definitely don't belong to me. - Ah, you have a right to be angry. I understand. - You understand. Hm, understand this. (door knocking) - Is your mother home? Where's your mother. - Denny, you could have let him in. - He doesn't belong here. (door knocking) - Look, I know it's weird but maybe he has changed. (gentle music) - People don't change Mare, they just become more of themselves. You can forgive him if you want. Just don't forget. - He's still our father, Denny. - Whether we like it or not. (door knocking) - Hey, is your mother here? (door knocking) - We're going for a classical cake, an ageless cake, tri-tiered with raspberries. - What is the matter with chocolate? - Chocolate? It's not a birthday cake. It's decorum at weddings to have white cake. - Ann, it's our wedding, why can't we have the cake I want. - Well look, let's not lose it over the cake, okay. We only have eight weeks, we have to order this stuff. - Oh, well may I suggest the three-tiered Forever Bliss selection. It's beautiful. It says love. And there's enough to send your guests home with a piece. - Who's gonna want to bring home white cake? - [Ann] Shut up. - [Richard] Hello everybody. - [Beatrice] Oh. - Nicolas, how are you? - Ignored. - Oh, how are you, Honey? - Oh, I'm peachy. - Richard Becker, Ann's father. - Beatrice Miller, huh. - Hello Richard. - Wedding cakes. - Yes, this is the one. This is the one-- - Now Margaret-- - I'm voting for this one. - Oh my. - Margaret, may I see you a moment? - Yeah, only with teal flowers. - With teal, teal. - Can we find some time together to talk next week? I'm gonna be looking at houses. - You mean you're gonna buy a house? Here? - Well, I decided to stay around the family, you know. And I'm gonna need a realtor. - Oh. - Have you picked a cake yet? - Yeah, um, I think we're gonna go with this one. - Oh, it's beautiful. - But does it express the breadth of your love? - (groaning) It's a cake. - Oh, yeah, like, I admit, it's small but we're not having a big wedding. - If you're not happy with the cake, get a bigger one. - We're on a budget. - Well let me buy the cake. Then she can have whatever she wants. - How 'bout chocolate? - Whatever you kids want. But make it something to remember. You only get married once. To each other. (laughs) Uh, what about the flowers? - Yes, oh that's next. All right, I thought cornflowers. - I had some fabulous ideas I was trying to talk your wife into. - Ex-wife. We did set a budget, Beatrice. - Let's at least listen to what she's got to say Margaret. Unless you're absolutely stuck on all these small things for Ann's wedding. - I'm not stuck. - Oh, may I? Picture sprays of white roses, lilacs everywhere. Where do you see the quartet? - [Richard] Why settle for a quartet? Why not a quintet? - What about the harp? - Gonna be okay? Okay, Mommy gotta go. But I'll be back, okay, I'll be back. Okay - You stay right here, okay. Kitty, what's that letter? Oh yeah. Yeah, now let's tie your shoe. - [Child] No, no. - Hey! Hey! So I thought you would have had me fired by now. - No, I wouldn't do that. But I don't have to talk to you. - Just let me make it up to you. How 'bout I cook you dinner. (Mary sighs) What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of me? - Your cooking. - Oh yeah, I happen to be a gourmet cook. You know, Julia Childs and me, we're just like this. - I'm sure. - Well, you'll never know until you try it, will ya. - Are you gonna harass me every time I drop off the kids? - Until you say ya, mm-hm. - Cook. If I don't like it, I'm walking. (air whooshing) - And the kitchen was remodeled only two years ago. Original hardwood floors. 12 foot ceilings with mahogany beams. A massive fireplace. It's a beautiful house. - You're beautiful. - Oh, Richard stop it. - [Richard] You always had a hard time taking a compliment. - Well we're not here to pay compliments, we're here to look at houses. Um, it's a big place. - Well there's room in case Andrew comes up with the girls. You know, big back yard. It's a great pool. I want to have huge barbecues during the summers. - You did look at the price. - Oh, I can swing it. I owe it to you. Especially for letting me help out with the wedding. You know and Ann have made me feel like a real member of the family. It means a lot to me. - You are her father. (laughs) - [Richard] You raised good kids. You have a lot to be proud. - It wasn't easy. - I'm sure. I'm sorry. For everything. (gentle music) - You should be. You missed the best parts of your kids lives. Um, why don't you just think about the house. Or we can see others if you like. Right now I have to get over to Beatrice's, I'm meeting Nick and Ann. - [Richard] Oh good, I'll follow you. (upbeat jazzy music) - Two weeks ago it was a simple dress. Now you want this overpriced, plunging neckline, Mardi Gras costume. - This gown makes a statement. - Yeah, I owe you. I mean, Ann, it would be a whole lot different if you could ever wear it again. - I'll be buried in it, okay? Look, I've never been married in a wedding dress. I want to do this right. - Then this dress is exactly what you need. - You are becoming the enemy, Beatrice. - Well if it isn't the happy couple. Beatrice. - Hello. - Something the matter? - Mm, you got your way, she wants a formal dress. - (gasps) Oh, great! (Richard laughing) (Margaret laughing) - This one. - Huh? Oh, uh huh. Did you see the price? - The price can't reflect on a gown that's a timeless classic. - Yeah, a '57 roadster is a timeless classic and she's not getting married in one of those either. - Kids, please, this is no way to start things off. Marriage is tough enough. You want the dress? - Yeah, yes. - We'll take the dress. - Very good, Mr. Becker. And I carry a complete line of accessories, perfect for this gown. - Richard, this isn't necessary, we can make a compromise, right Ann? - Mom. - Margaret, I am her father. I haven't done anything for her in years. Please, let me. - Father knows best. (bright twangy music) (Richard laughing) Dad. (laughs) Oh thank you. - You have fine taste, sir. - Uh, no, my daughter has fine taste. I have a gold card. (all laughing) (Margaret laughs) - Uh huh. Black Tux. - Definitely. - Big time. (crickets chirping) - [Mary] I'll admit, that was very good. - See. You have to trust me. You have a hard time with that, don't ya. - Oh, I'm not used to dating. - Well after you've been off the market for a while it's kind of tough. - Yeah. I've never really been on the market. I was in a religious order for eight years. (laughs) - What about Maggie? - Well, I wanted a baby. And so, Maggie's father was willing to accommodate. (laughs) - Oh, well that's uh, that's uh, that's understandable. (clears throat) I guess. Uh, listen, I'm gonna be right back, I just gonna go check on Tig. - Okay. Oh God. (crickets chirping) (Mary laughing) - Busted. - I don't believe you. - Well, don't get mad, you know, I. Look, I didn't get home in time to stoke the stove, so I, I got stuck. (gentle music) - I better go. (Ken blows raspberry) - [Ann] Nick, you're not inviting all your cop buddies, are you? - It's a tradition at the station. - Look guys, we must cut 40 people off this list and get these invitation in the mail by Friday. Now we have one month. I mean we're never gonna get all these people into the back yard. - What's going on. - Oh, we're cutting the invitation's list. Any thoughts? - Yeah, it's kind of up to Nick and Ann. - Thank you, John. Glad to see somebody recognizes the fact that I'm involved here. - What about, what about Uncle Bill and Aunt Dotty? They won't come anyway. - Oh, they never come but the send great gifts, we should leave 'em. Just give me just a second. - Now look. - John? - Yeah? - I need a big favor. - Sure. - Well, my dad's back. - He is? I wondered who that guy was hanging out in the dining room. - Yeah (laughs) well, um, with my dad back and paying for part of the wedding. I thought maybe he should give me away at the wedding. - Ah. - It's not that I'm not aware of everything you've done for me. It's (sighs). It's just he's my father. - It's okay, I understand. - Yeah? (laughs) Thanks. Thanks for understanding. - Sure. (gentle music) - Go cut the guest list. - Don't, Margaret. He is her father, I just don't like him hanging out at our house. - He's involved in this wedding. - Yeah, and if not the wedding, you're showing him houses. - Oh, John. Every since the baby came it seems like you and I just, we never have time to be together. And now this wedding. I think you and I should find some time to-- - Margaret. We need you back in there. Pronto. (John sighs) - Pronto. (bright jazzy music) (Margaret sighs) - [Ann] You're dating a biker? - Oh, Ann, he's not a biker. I mean, he has a motorcycle but he also has a child. - (snickers) Well he's probably got dozens more across the country. You want me to have Nick run a check on him. - No! - He could be a Hell's Angel or wanted in Arizona for bank robbery, you never know. Have you met his gang? - Gang? - All bikers have gangs. God, you're sticking me. - [Beatrice] Oh sorry, dear. - Yeah, don't let him get you alone with his gang. - Why? - Th initiation. You're gonna be chuggin' beer and swappin' spit with guys named Mongo and Snake. - Ann, he doesn't have a gang. He's a construction worker and he has a son. - Fine, fine, don't say I didn't warn you. (groans) So, did you do it? (Beatrice huffs) - No, we didn't do it! - [Ann] It's only a matter of time. (engine puttering) - [Dennis] That was a hell of a catch, John. - Yes, yes it was. - For an old guy. - What! - Yeah (laughs). - For an old guy? - For an old guy. - [John] Listen, man, I went three for three. You know that that means, three for three, not only that man did you give me four RBI. - You batted three times, I know that. - Honey, we're home. You should have been there. We blew 'em away! - I'm in the kitchen, dear. There's one for you, one for you. Put it over here. - What are you doing here? - I'm feeding the kids. - Where's Margaret. - Well, the girls wanted to try on the dresses for the wedding. Margaret's showing a house. So I said I'd stay with the kids so they could take their time. - My mother must be losing her mind. You couldn't take care of your own kids. - Thanks, I'll take over. - Everything's under control. (baby babbling) - Ah, cocktails with the kids. Put a little in their cereal they take good naps. - Drinking, while you're alone with the children? - I raised four kids, John. There's no problem. - You raised four kids? You got another family I don't know about? - I changed plenty of your dirty diapers. - Yeah, and then you took a 22 year vacation. Glad you're back after your rest. - You can go back to wherever you're staying. I'll watch the children now. - John-- - My patience is very thin. - I'm not in competition with you. I want you to know that. - I want you to know something. I know what your game is and it's not gonna work. Now find the door and use it. (upbeat quirky music) (child laughing) All right Robert my man. (John and Robert laughing) (engine revving) - [Margaret] Oh (laughs). - [Ken] How you doin'. - Hello again. - Hi, I'm Margaret, I'm Mary's mother. - Hi, I'm Ken. Could you tell Mary I'm here? - (laughs) I think she heard you. - Hi, um, this is my mom and you met John. - Yeah. Uh, listen, I got you a little gift. - Oh, this is great. Isn't this great. - Great. - In lieu of flowers. - We won't be late. - Don't drive to fast. (engine revving) She gets a tattoo I'm killing myself. (John laughing) - [Ann] Dad's staying in a nice place, nice and pricey don't you think. En suite. - Excuse me. I'm Margaret Hicks, we're meeting Richard Becker for lunch. - Mrs. Hicks, correct, walk this way. - [Man] I know. - I can't walk that way. - Try, dear. (Ann laughing) (people chattering) - [Man] Yeah. (people chattering) - I don't maybe they're gonna like take us through the kitchen. - Richard probably planned a surprise, Honey. - Won't take us through the kitchen. - Oh no, well let's ask him? - He seems to know what he's doing, but. Uh, oh no. Oh wait. Wait, excuse me. I think there's been a mistake. - There's no mistake. (Ann laughing) (laughs) What do you think. Is this a great place for a reception? There you go. - A reception here? - And I've found a great chapel, I've booked them both. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. We're having the wedding and the reception in the backyard. - Well you were saying that there wasn't enough room for everybody, so this way we can invite all your friends. Now, picture a band there, a dance floor here, cake over there and a sit down dinner for all your guests. - It would be unbelievable. (Richard laughing) - Richard, this is just a bit much. - And when they announce, will the parents of the bride please join the newlyweds for a dance, we can show them how it used to be done. (Margaret gasps) (Ann humming) (Ann and Richard humming) - Oh, Mom. - We have to get lunch. We have a lot of things to do. - [Richard] Your mother's right. - [Margaret] What, here? - Why not? (laughs) Well. (women laughing) (Richard laughing) (Margaret laughing) (Richard laughing) - Well, uh, thank you for bringing me home. Um, I think we got a lot accomplished. - I'm having the best time with you and Ann. It really takes me back. - Well it's making Ann very happy. - What about you? - Me? - I'm, I'm very glad you're a part of this Richard. I'm very glad you're taking some responsibility. - It means a lot to me to do this for Ann. - Say, have you got time to have a drink with me? - I can't do that, Richard. - Not even to celebrate your sale of the house. - Are you gonna buy the house? But that's wonderful. I just know you're going to be very happy-- (gentle music) (Richard sighs) - We'll always have that spark. I'll come by your office tomorrow to fill out the papers. (quiet somber music) - Wet this please, moisture. (Mary laughs) - So you really want to meet my father? - What? I thought all daughters were supposed to be in love with their fathers. - He walked out on us when I was eight. - That explains a lot. - It's not why I entered the convent, if that's what you're thinking. - I meant, why you have such a hard time trusting other people. - Oh, I think I trust other people probably more than I should. - I'm falling for you, Mary. (gentle music) - Yeah, right. - See what I mean? - What? It's not that I don't trust you, Ken. I don't know what I'm feeling. This is, uh, I'm not used to this. (Ken sighs) - I don't want to scare you. - And I don't want to disappoint you. - I am not disappointed. See the way you look at me, I feel special. - You are. - Okay. We'll take this as slow as you want. (both laughing) - Ah, ah, ah, I'm blind. Oh you are gonna get it. - [Margaret] Now just concentrate, Annie, you can do it. - Okay, wait, wait. - Okay. - Hang on. - Okay. - All right, wait. - Good. - Hold it. Hold it. - You got it? - Wait a minute, okay. I got it, wait. Oh! (crowd groans) - That was your fault Ann, you have to stretch out your neck. - I can't pass an orange, my neck's not big enough. - Now if we were using our mouths. (Margaret and Ann laughing) - Oh, could you say that again, Mrs. Hicks? I want to write down every funny thing that's said for Ann's memory book. - Don't sweat it, Trish, I'll remember. - I guess you win the orange pass. - I should have won. - Well, maybe you'll with the clothespin drop or the name the baby game. - The clothespin drop! No wait, the pasta shell game and then the cotton ball scoop. (woman groaning) - So exciting. - Where (laughs), where did you get these games? - Well honey, we used to play this at bridal showers all the time. (women groaning) - Okay, everybody's bored. - [All] No. - Am I wrong? - [All] No. - Okay, I did something that I swore I would never do. - Uh oh. - Mm-hm. - I called the police. - You what? - Yeah, I called the police. - (gasps) Mary! - Oh!

So do you want to open your gifts now? - I don't know, I'm afraid to see what you all got me. - Well mine is something you can use on your honeymoon. (laughs) Okay, Okay guys, Nick wants to open his gifts now, huh? Yeah! (men cheering) - [Man] Let's go. - [Man] Open mine first. - Yeah. - Hey. Anybody home? (laughs) I thought that there was a party here. (laughing) Huh? Hey, how's it goin'. - Hello, Mr. Becker. - Nicholas, I know my son didn't invite me to your party but I didn't want this time honored tradition to go by without a little gift from your future father-in-law. Nicholas, these are my friends. - I'm Chastity. And this is Divinity. - Nicholas, these girls will do anything you want. And they have some talent-- - Have you girls been paid for your services? - Hey John, they're not for you. - Yeah, we usually get a tip regardless. - Great, go buy your mother a card, let's go, out. - [Richard] I paid good money for them. - You bring two hookers into my home for the guy who's marrying your daughter? You're sick. - You should do something about your bitterness, Denny. - Oh, I'll do something about it. - Hey, hey, Denny - hey, hey. Not the time or the place. Why don't you help Nick with his gifts. - I don't have to take this from my own son. - Yeah, well then get the hell out. - Fine! My own son doesn't want me in his home. Fine. He hates me. My own son hates me. My own son hates me. (crying) - Come on. (gentle somber music) - You do remember the wedding's not at the house? Okey-doke. See you then. (phone ringing) Margaret Hicks. (clock ticking) Insufficient funds. Well, I think there must be. Could you give me time to find? Yes, of course, I understand. Cool down. - What's the matter? - Oh, his escrow check bounced. - Richard's? - Oh, I can't believe I fell for this again. - Well, you gave him the benefit of the doubt. (Margaret laughing) - (sighs) Maybe too much benefit. Where are you car keys. - On the table. - Come on. (bells tinkling) (light flute music) - Beatrice? - [Beatrice] Well, nothing was paid for. - What do you mean, nothing? The dress, the flowers, the cake. - Your husband's credit card was over its limit. - That's ex-husband. - Whatever. I've called him and got a check. Boing boing boing. - Uh, what happens if we give you a check now, a good one? - (laughs) Too late, I had another girl who loved the gown so I sold it to her. (Margaret gasps) I canceled the flowers and cake. Hm. - Can I use your phone? - Hm? - Yes, hello, I'm checking on the Becker-Lundgren, - Reception. - Reception on the 11th. I see, thank you very much. Canceled. Two weeks before the wedding. This is kill, Ann. - And when I get through with Richard he's gonna wish he were dead. (thunder booming) (rain drumming) (man coughing) - [Richard] Wow Ann, I want to see that adorable grandchild of mine. - [Mary] Uh, Dad, I think you've had too much to drink tonight. - [Richard] I was celebrating with my daughter. - [Mary] I know, but I think you should come in maybe and have some coffee and maybe sleep on the couch. - [Richard] No, no, no, he doesn't like me. - [Mary] Who? - [Richard] Margaret's new husband. - [Mary] Oh no. - [Richard] You are such a good girl. - [Mary] Oh Dad. - [Richard] I want to see my granddaughter. - [Mary] Okay, well we just have to be a little quiet. - [Richard] I want to see her. Oh, that's great. - Sh. You have to be a little quiet, Dad. - [Richard] Where's my granddaughter, I want to see her. - No, you don't want to see her because she's not, I think she's sleeping. So let me go up and check. - [Richard] Do you know that have turned into a lovely young lady. - Thank you, Dad. Do you want some coffee? - [Richard] No, I uh-- - I'll get some coffee. But let me check and I'll get her. - [Richard] Bring her to me. - I'll bring her, but sh. - [Richard] Bring her down. (Richard humming) - (sighs) Mom? Mom! - What? - Dad's downstairs, he's drunk and he wants to see Maggie. - Richard's downstairs? Oh ho, ho, ho. - Where is my gorgeous little granddaughter. - Dad. - Richard, please! Listen to me, the babies are asleep. Now you leave them be. I want to talk to you. You wait for me downstairs. - Oh, I know that tone. I am in trouble again. I just want to see my granddaughter. - Dad, please! - Richard, downstairs. Downstairs! (thunder crashing) Oh my God, John's in the study working. I hope he doesn't hear Richard, he's already furious with him. - Why? - Oh, don't you worry about that, it's just-- (baby crying) (body thudding) (glass shattering) (dramatic music) - Dad? - [Margaret] Richard! - Richard! (Margaret gasping) Richard! - Oh God. - Oh my Lord. Call 4-1-1. - oh yeah. No, not 4-1-1 that's information. It's 9-1-1. - 9-1-1. - Margaret, sh, sh. - Sh, sh. And a first aid kit. And ice, get and ice pack. - Okay we know CPR, we know CPR. - I forgot it. - Margaret, Margaret. You may not need the ice pack. He's dead. - What? - He's dead. - Dead? - Dead. (thunder booming) - Oh this is gonna make the wedding. (thunder crashing) (somber music) - I know this can't be easy, losing your dad. - He was never the best father. - Well, still. He's the only one you've got. - (sighs) I want to be sad that he just came back into our life and now he's gone but all I feel is this. - That's all right to be angry. - Yeah, but why? Why am I so mad at him? - The guy walked out on ya. - Did you love him? - He was never there. - Loving somebody that you don't think loves you back, that hurts. You know. You've got a right to be angry. It's okay to love somebody else. - Can I stay here tonight? I mean, I just want to be held and that's all. - If that's what you need, I'm your man. (somber flute music) - Thank you. Andrew, hi baby. Oh. - John. - Andrew. - I'm glad you got in for this. - Oh, he was my dad. I loved him. He was like the little brother I never had. (Margaret laughing) Denny. - Andrew. - [Margaret] Where are the girls? - Oh, they're staying with friends. Dad sent 'em some plane tickets for the wedding. They're bouncing all the way here. - The tickets weren't paid for either? - Either? - Oh. Never mind, nothing. Say hello to your sisters, they're not taking this too well. - Annie, how you doing? - Good to see you. (Margaret hissing) - Um, when are we gonna tell Ann? - Let's bury Richard first. I can't believe that on top of everything else, now we're paying for the funeral. - It's just like him, isn't it? He's where he wants to be. But we have to climb up to him. - Oh, you know, Dad always did want to have the last laugh. - Come on now, it's just a hill. - [John] Whoa, whoa. - A muddy hill. - Uh, you guys want to help your sisters? Whoa. And, uh, take your time about it. It's not like he's going anywhere. You okay? - Yes. - Oh, geez, all right. - Careful. - For each of us begins as dust and to the earth we all must return. (gentle music) But as the human, as the human body is interred in the earth, resting there for eternity, our souls rest with God in his eternal light, amen. - [Audience] Amen. - Uh, since I was not a friend of Richard's, I always ask the eldest son if he would come up and say a few words on behalf of the family. - You do it, say something. - I'm not the oldest, you're the oldest. - [Mary] Come on, Denny. - Go on. (Denny sighs) - My father wanted more than anything to be loved. But he was very afraid of being loved because it meant committing to someone. So if there's anything that we can learn from Richard Becker, it's that we need to love because people deserve it. Not because we want them to love us. - To conclude our service today, I would ask a member of the family to come and place a rose on the casket before we inter Richard's body to the ground. (casket crashing) (women gasping) (casket creaking) (casket thudding) (upbeat jazzy music) (Margaret sighing) - Oh, should we tell her now, do you think? - Yes, let's do. Yeah, you know, I think she's gonna take it just fine. I mean, she didn't even want a big wedding in the first place. - True, she didn't really want the big dress or the cake. - Only after Richard talked her into all that stuff did she finally agree. No, I think our little Annie's gonna take this news just fine. Here we go. - Oh, thanks Mom. - Mm. - Don't worry, I'll still fit in the wedding dress. - Um. We need to talk about the dress. - Don't tell me they're not gonna have it ready. - Richard didn't pay for the dress. - Oh no. (sighs) Well, don't worry, Nick and I'll figure some way to pay it off. - Uh, no honey, you don't understand. When he didn't pay for the dress they sold it. - They sold my dress? - He didn't pay for anything. His checks all bounced. His credit card was no good. - (sighs) I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Yeah, we can still pull this thing together. - Yeah, it may not be exactly what you wanted but it can still be terrific. It'll take some work but we've got 10 days. - [Margaret] I'll just start making some calls. - I can't do this. - Oh, yes, it'll be a busy week and a half but we can do it. - I can't call all those people, I can't, I can't look for another dress. I just, I can't do it. - [Nick] Ann, it's okay. - No, I've been through this twice before, I can't go into this marriage wrong. - Look Honey, what choice do we have? - Nick, I love you. But, I will not marry you feeling this, damn him. Damn him! - Ann. (John sighs) (door thuds) - She didn't take it well. - No. (birds chirping) (engine puttering) - (laughing) That was amazing! Oh, I want one! That's it, I want one! - Yeah, you liked that, I told you you would. - Yes, Mom and John are gonna lose it, but I don't care I have to have one. - I could get you a basket case and fix it up. - Really? - Yeah, I mean, you don't need a hog as big as mine, but I bet you we can get you one for next to nothing. (gentle music) - That was better than the motorcycle. (Ken sighs) - I love you, Mary. - You want to go inside? - Are you sure? - Yeah. (Mary laughing) - Just listen to what we have to say, hm? - I tell you what, I think I'm gonna listen to what you have to say. - That's all we ask. Okay. - Yeah? (dramatic music) - Nick, what are you doing here? - I called him. - Oh. - Now listen to me. You walk away from Nick you're letting your ex-husbands and your father make a decision for ya. - That's not it. - Yeah, it is, Honey. You can't tell me you don't love Nick. The only retaliation you have is your own happiness. - Oh Honey, you don't want to throw that away. - (crying) I'm scared. I'm scared of failing again. - You've never failed me Ann. And I didn't put this ring on your finger because I had any doubts about coming through for you. I don't care how or where we get married or who's there or what we're wearing. All I want is you. (Ann gasping) - We only have seven days if we're going to pull a wedding together. Of course, it's up to you. (gentle music) (Ann laughing) - I love you. - I love you. - I think that's yes. (John laughing) - So what am I gonna wear to this wedding? - Yeah, I know there's a penalty, just transfer the money to my checking account today. Yes. I know it's my IRA but we need the money for Ann's wedding. Yeah, just cash it in and I'll pick up the money tomorrow, okay? Thanks. (staple gun clicking) - This is the perfect bell. - I'd say you're, uh, gifted. - They look great. - Hm, thank you. - Tell everyone we got the table and chairs too. (men groaning) - Why don't you flip on a tape. - [Dennis] All right. - Denny, it's white, pink, white. - White, pink, white's fine. - No. (dramatic piano music) ♪ At first I was afraid, ♪ ♪ I was petrified ♪ ♪ Kept thinking ♪ ♪ I could never live without you by my side ♪ ♪ But then I spent so many nights ♪ ♪ Thinkin' how you did me wrong ♪ ♪ And I grew strong ♪ - [Andrew] I don't, maybe it's waiting for yours.

Ken's wife. - Ken's wife? - I'd show you the ring but I hocked it years ago. - I don't believe this. - Look, uh, if Ken didn't tell you about me, then jump his case. Now, if you don't mind, I was right in the middle of a nap. (somber music) - [Ann] Okay, and the flowers will be here tomorrow morning. - We are almost finished outside. - Yeah, I just have to find that stupid screwdriver. - Who said you could see the bride before the wedding? - It's not our wedding day yet. - 22 hours and 36 minutes. - Are you gonna do this to me all day long? - Mm-hm. - Get out the shotgun, Ma. We may have to keep him here overnight, make sure he don't run. (Mary giggles) - Hey, I've been through this twice, nothing scares me. - Oh, don't let that veneer fool you. She's nervous too. I think it's in the bottom drawer. - She's been over the wedding list a hundred times. - Oh something smells good. Whew. Chocolate cake. - From scratch. - [Nick] You made me a cake. - I made a wedding cake. You wanted chocolate, you get chocolate. - Oh wow, I guess this marriage stuff might not be too bad after all. - Well, don't count on seeing Betty Crocker too often. She goes back in the box after this. - I love you. - Oh. 35 minutes. (both laughing) - Nick? Let's go. - Bye. (Ann laughing) - Ah, well. Well, I don't know how we did this but, we got everything covered. Except who you'll be dancing with. - All right, enough Ann or you'll be walking down the aisle with a limp tomorrow. - You should return his calls. - Ann, leave her alone. - [Mary] Mom, I can handle it. - Well you better be able to because hark, (engine revving) I hear a hog. - Did you call him! - You know, much as it killed me not to, I was just too busy. Had a feeling this guy would come on his own. (engine revving) - Get out of here! - No, not until you hear me out. - What were gonna do, Ken, tell me it slipped your mind you were married? - Look, I haven't seen Francine in over two years. - That is no excuse, you lied to me. - No, no, I did not. (sighs) Look, I didn't tell you about Francine at first because, because it just didn't matter. Then when I fell for you. I got afraid that you would be scared off. - I'm not afraid of the truth, Ken. - Yeah, well you're not exactly the same Mary I met three months ago, you know. I mean, don't get me wrong, I liked that one. But I love this one. I tracked Francine down to sign divorce papers because I would like to be free to follow what I feel for you. (gentle music) - You mean it? - Think you can handle me? - Think you can handle me? - I don't know. But I'd like to try. - Yes! (Ann laughing) - I got you something. (Mary laughs) - I love it. Do you love it? Do you love it? - Uh huh. - Love it. - Hop on. - Mary, you can't get on the motorcycle in your dress! Oh! (upbeat synthesizer music) Now I've seen it all. - (laughing) Mom. - [Margaret] Hey, hey, we did it. You guys better go ahead and start getting ready. - They're beautiful. - [Margaret] Oh honey, thank you for all your work. - You'd do it for us, Mom. - [Margaret] Yes, I would. Andrew. - I gotta go pick the girls up at the airport. - [Margaret] All right, be careful, drive careful. - Mm-hm. - Okay. (Margaret laughs) - John, I know that you cashed in part of your savings to make this happen for Ann. I think that was a very sweet sacrifice for her and for me. - For us, Margaret. - For us. (gentle music) You know, we got married right here. - (laughs) Yeah. That was quite a week too. But we got through it. - I've never been happier about anything in my whole life. I, Margaret, take you John for my husband. - To have and to hold. - [Margaret] For richer for poorer. - For better, for worse. - In sickness and in health. - For all time to come. - You may kiss the bride. Oh, I love you Mr. Hicks. - (laughs) Oh, I love you Mrs. Hicks. (Margaret laughing) (bright harp music) (people chattering) - Okay Nick? - Mm-hm. - Whew, hey, how are you. Oh, so good to see you, you look great. Hey, Mom is around the back, why don't you go say hi, I'll be back there shortly. - Andrew and the girls haven't arrived yet. - Yeah, well, um, I'll keep an eye out for 'em. - Yeah okay. - Mom. - You know, next to my own kids, there's nobody I'd rather have call me that. (laughs) I'll see how Annie's doing in. - Say hi. Oh hey, how you doing? Good to see you. Nice to see you again. Gifts, good. - You're shaking. - Well, yeah, I need lipstick. - You have to relax! You're never gonna live through this. - Yeah, well. - How are things in here. - We're ready. - Oh! - What? - What? - Oh God. - What is it. - Oh gosh! - Ann? - Where are you going? - Cold feet. - [Margaret] Oh, Ann! - Thanks for coming here on such short notice. Be sure and sign the book. - John! - [John] What are you doing? - I forgot the most important thing. I need someone to walk me down the aisle. Would you honor me? - If I had a daughter, I'd want her to be just like you. - Well, you do have a daughter, two of them. And three sons. You're stuck with us. (John laughing) - You're gonna make my mascara run. - Grandma, Grandpa, we made it! - Jersey, Amy, we were nervous, where have you been? - The flight was delayed. - Oh. - [Margaret] Well your dresses are upstairs, I hope they fit. - Oh, you know what, we're gonna have to curl your hair and fix it Jersey. - Can we see Robert and Maggie first? - I want to see Officer Nick in his new tuxedo. I bet he looks awesome. (Ann laughing) - Get upstairs, get upstairs, we got a wedding, hurry. - Come on! - Go on. (gentle harp music) - [Man] Oh my. (laughing) - Oh gosh. - Hello. (people laughing) - Come on Robert, this way. (people laughing) - [Woman] Aw. (people chattering) - Hey, look at that, there's Mary. There's Mary. (bright organ music) - Here she is, quiet. ("Bridal March") - This is a blessed beautiful day. Perfect for a wedding-- - Could we just skip to the questions because if I faint I want to know I got to the important stuff. - All right. Face each other. (bright bells chiming) (people chattering) - I can't see what you're-- - Get in a little tighter there. Yep, that looks good. Okay, ready? And, there we go. (both laughing) all right, now let's have a little kiss. - How 'bout one of these. - How 'bout one of these. - Oh that's good, hold it right there. Right there. (laughing) All right, now we need everyone from Ann's family in here. - Oh. - Oh, oh. - [Margaret] Come on everybody. Come on. Mary, bring Ken and Tig over for the picture. - [Mary] Come take a picture with us. - No, it's your family. - No, come on. - Come on buddy, let's go for a ride. - Let's see if can get everybody in here. Come on in, the kids, everybody just squeeze in there where ever you can. Just fit right in, that's great, great, okay. Okay, all right, everybody ready here? - We're gonna have to rent chairs for the dining room table. Holidays are gonna be something. - And ready? - Look right there. - All right, and everybody say family. - [All] Family! - All right, one more time, family, ready? - [All] Family!
