This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Tracy, how long on that pork check for the VIP ticket? 45 seconds. OK. How long are the tomatoes, Lou? Pulling them out now, Chef. Perfect. Chef, that looks gorgeous. Should we plate the rest? Sheridan Reeve's last review of Chez Garrett, it was good, but it wasn't great. He needs to know the Garrett's new restaurant isn't the same. Got to give him a different experience. I love when you get that look in your eyes. Copy that, Chef. Do you want us to plate it a different way? I don't want to plate it at all. It's a risk, but hopefully it pays off. Em, you are my idol. Serving the meal family style is brilliant. Yeah. Bravo, Chef. What's this I hear about family style? Chef, hi. Yes, I did decide to serve a meal... Family style, in one of my restaurants? Yes. I just thought that this food is meant to bring people together. Yeah. I should have been here. I'm sorry. I called you the second he showed up. That's not your fault, Emma. That's what critics do. They just show up, OK? But let's just hope you're right. He's about to take a bite. He loves it. And Garrett, at some point, Sheridan asked that you come to the table. OK. Great job, everyone, especially you, Emma. Em, why don't you bring out the dessert so I can introduce you? Great. Can you tell I'm still wearing makeup from the shoot? Oh, no, no. You look good. Great work, everyone. So good. Can you start browning the cobbler for me? Yes, Chef. Great. Aunt June, hey! Emma? Where are you? Oh, I'm in the refrigerator. You are not going to believe it, but Sheridan Reeves is here, and he loves my food. Well, of course he does. And Garrett says he's going to introduce me tonight. About time that man appreciates you. Soon, we will be celebrating you having your own restaurant. That is the dream. Just know, honey, that your home away from home here on Oahu is always waiting for you. Thank you, Aunt June. And I promise, as soon as my work allows, I am going to be on a plane, and I'm going to come see you. All right, I got to go. Love you. Love you. Sheridan, such an honor to have you here. I heard rumors that your food here was vastly more elevated than Chez Garrett, but I got to be honest, I assumed you'd brought someone in. Really? Why would you assume that? You know I like your food, but tonight had so much more heart. And the decision to serve it family style was genius. I wouldn't quite call it genius, but... And that potato dish was exceptional. You know, it reminds me of my grandma's brabant potatoes, but more elevated. What was that incredible sauce you created for it? Well, that was the, uh... the, um... Smoked paprika cashew aioli. Oh, and this is... Hi. The peach cobbler. Oh. Smells delicious. Thank you, Emma. I did a little mint on the top to bring out the flavor of the actual, um... I have a Left Bank Cab Bordeaux for you, your favorite. What happened tonight? Look, Em, I really wanted to introduce you, I swear. It just wasn't the right moment. Yeah, but if tonight wasn't the right moment, then when, Garrett? You did great in there tonight, but I just can't have Sheridan Reeves knowing everything... What, knowing that those are my recipes, or that... That I'm your girlfriend? You know I want to, right? I just... the Gourmet Network is more interested in me being a bachelor on my Instagram than it is in my cooking. Garrett, you're so incredibly talented. Being honest about having a girlfriend is not going to ruin that. You're right. You're right. I know. I know. And I'm going to shout it from the rooftops just as soon as I get the show renewed, OK? Just a few more weeks, please. I don't need rooftops. I need... Listen, I'll give you the credit you deserve, OK? I promise. All right? Hello? Anyone still here? Sorry to interrupt. I think I may have forgot my phone. Nothing to interrupt here. We're just having a quick chef-mentee debrief, actually. Oh. Found it. Hey, you know, I was thinking, what if I expand my article into a cover story for Food and Wine? And I love the mentorship angle. Ella, was it? Emma. Oh, of course. I'm sure after seeing Chef Garrett prepare the food tonight, you've learned quite a bit. Oh, yes. I have learned quite a bit tonight. Garrett, I'll be in touch. Have a great night. What? I couldn't contradict what I just told him. But you can contradict what you just told me. You are a very, very talented chef, Emma. But this is business, all right? We've all paid our dues. The sooner you learn that, the better. OK. That's... that's the thing, Garrett. It's actually not just business for me. This is over, professionally and personally. Emma, what are you talking about? You're just overreacting again. Yeah, of course you would say that. Of course you would say. You can't just walk away. I gave you your shot, OK? Before you met me, you were cooking on the line for what, 10 years, huh? Without my recommendation, you are just another line cook. You need me. No, Garrett. I need me. You OK? I made us some hibiscus iced tea. Did I just pack a bag and fly to Hawaii? You did indeed. I believe it's the most spontaneous thing you've ever done. Maybe I overreacted. Maybe you didn't. Garrett was just trying to do what he thought was best. What if he was right? First of all, coming to this island is never an overreaction. And it sounds to me like Garrett did what's best for Garrett. You remember, it was your food that blew away one of the most prominent food critics in the country. You're right. I know you're right. Cheers to that. Wow. This is delicious. I'm not without skills. Emma, honey, you can't build a house unless you have a good foundation. Sorry to say, it sounded like yours had more than a few cracks. I think I knew that in my gut. But I loved him, you know? And he's right. I was just a line cook before he gave me a shot. What if I do need him? If Garrett can't acknowledge who you are, in and out of the kitchen, I can guarantee you you're better off without him. I don't know. I just need a break from it all. I need to rethink what I want. No need to figure it all out now. Take a breath. Enjoy Waikiki bliss. You're not taking a break from eating, too, are you? Let's not get crazy, now. There's my girl. Come on. Let's get you unpacked. Settling in OK? Oh, yeah. Everything's great. It's beautiful. Was this Uncle Kai's? Sure was. Do you remember when he tried to teach me how to surf? Do I ever. You were so terrified. You wouldn't get in past your ankles. I know it must be so hard to be here without him. I miss him so much, too. You two had such a special bond. I did always promise him that I'd give it a second go. You know, it's not too late. You remember him saying when you're out in the ocean, your problems just melt away? He wasn't wrong. So how about some supper? Sounds good. I'll just jump in the shower. OK. Hey, good to see you. Look at you two. All right. Have a good night. What are you talking about? That can't be possible. Sir, like I said, we don't do lessons anymore. But you can buy or rent. But you're the only surf shop at this end of the beach. It's just bad business. I'm sorry, man. I don't know what to tell you. Hermano, with those customer service skills, should have had you train the waitstaff. Shouldn't you be over there, roasting a pig or something? You wish. Mira, I brought you a little bit of food because I know how you forget to eat. This smells just like Mom's. Except her serving of mofongo would have been, like, three times this size. And if you left one little bite... Did you sleep in here again last night? Yeah. Inventory went late. Wait till you taste Franky's salsa flight. Of course, you have to pair it with a Serrano Margarita. Oh, of course you do. If it tastes good as it smells, I'm in. So I'm going to go check on the table. Why don't you take a peek? I'll come back and get you when the table's ready. OK. OK, you know I don't have a filter, so I'm just going to say it. I'm worried about you. Don't be. You'd be surprised how comfy this thing is. I'm not just talking about that. You used to love to give surf lessons. Oh, so you're worried because I no longer want to spend my time giving lessons to overeager tourists who are trying to find themselves? Ben, Estrella is... Let's just not go there. We have a customer. Excuse me. OK, but if she was still running the shop with you, don't you think that she would want you to confront your... There's nothing to confront. I'm perfectly capable of giving lessons. I just choose not to. Hey. Need any help over there? Uh, hi. Yes. Do you have surf booties in a size 6? I do, but I wouldn't recommend those for beginners. How do you know I'm a beginner? You're buying booties when there is no rocks and it's 90 degrees out. Maybe I have very sensitive feet. And that leash you're holding is for a stand-up paddleboard. Perhaps I enjoy both sports. Yeah, perhaps. Yeah. Or maybe I don't want you to spend money on things you don't need. And how do you know what I need? Let me guess. You came to Hawaii to find yourself, right? No. Come on. I came for surf lessons. Do you offer surf lessons? He's the best surfer and surf instructor on the island. Oh, look who it is. Hey. Oh, two times in one week. Good to see you. Oh, my goodness. You're so beautiful. You are gorgeous. What is this dress you're wearing? Thank you. Gentlemen, this is my niece Emma, all the way from Atlanta, Georgia. Hi, there. Hi. Seems like fate. So do you think you have time for me, or? I need to check. I checked his schedule. Believe it or not, he has an opening tomorrow, 6:00 AM. Great. Then that's settled. It's a date. No, it's not a date. Finally, an updated version of my mother's Asopao de Pollo Oh, it smells incredible. Please eat. Buen provecho! Mm. The depth of flavor is just... It's so layered. It's like I can taste every herb and spice. It just melts together into this palate-pleasing combination. Is that culantro? I'm impressed. Most gringas, they can't tell the subtle but important difference between culantro and cilantro. So how many carrots do I have to chop for you to give this recipe to me? It's the island secret ingredient. Puerto Rican dishes, they're very complementary and similar to Polynesian flavors. The one just seems to elevate the other. Franky, you have to try her Southern fried chicken. It's heaven on Earth. Sign me up, sister. I miss me some good Southern cooking so much. Fun fact, he actually went to culinary school in Louisiana. Oh, I knew I liked you. Well, if you like this, you're going to love what I have for the annual Big Wave cook-off. I watch that every year. You know, two of my idols I heard are judging this year, the fabulous Lee Anne Wong and Katie Lee. Katie Lee. Oh, my God, I just can't, right? I love her. Wait, are you competing? Is the Pope Catholic? Oh, wait. Did you come to the island to compete, too? Oh, actually, she's taking a break from the kitchen at this moment. Oh, really? That's so sad. I wanted to have a chance to taste your cooking. Oh. I mean, I guess cooking with a friend isn't the same thing as cooking in a formal kitchen. It's true. And after this incredible meal, I mean, how could I say no? What about tomorrow, my place? I'll whip up my famous passion fruit mojitos, and you all can mess up my kitchen. And maybe you're going to share with me your fried chicken recipe? Only if you'll give me the recipe for your asopao. That one might sting a bit, but OK, you have a deal. OK. Seriously, this is so good. I know. He knows. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Why? Why did you do this? Well, I'm here. Yeah. Did this really have to be at 6:00 AM? Surfer's hours, Gidget. What? I'm on time. You cold? No. You do know we're in Hawaii, right? Oh, yeah. Look, this is a... this is a surfing wetsuit. Yeah, if you were surfing in the Atlantic or Iceland. Very funny. Well, at least you won't get a rash. Rash? No, no, no, no. No one said anything about a rash. What kind of rash? You know what? Don't answer that. Do you have any surfing experience? Well, I've seen Blue Crush, like, four times, and I love Keanu Reeves. OK, so let's start from the beginning. OK. Just before we start, I just... I just have to say, I'm kind of sort of extremely terrified of the ocean. But that's not going to be a problem, right? You know how to swim, right? It's not that I don't know how to swim. I mean, pools have never been an issue. Oh there... there are no sharks on the end of the beach. It's not that. It's... it's the waves. Oh, the waves. There are no waves in surfing. Just FYI, I respond better to positive reinforcement. Noted. The second most important thing is to stay relaxed and to not panic. That's when you get in trouble. OK. All right. Well, I guess now is as good a time as any. Shall we? Whoa, whoa. Not so fast, sufer girl. We're going to start right here. Surfing it's not just about the ocean. It's a way of life. It's a mindset. So we're to start with breathing. You do know how to breathe, right? Yeah, I'm pretty good at that. OK. So let's start. OK. Now, raise your arms. OK. Breathe in through the nose, out through the mouth. Every surfer has their own ritual before getting in the water. OK. Now we're going to try a few pop ups. Uh, in the ocean? No, still not yet. All right. I feel like I've got this surfing thing down. Start paddling. And hold it, the board, on this position. And when I say pop up. All right. Well, your turn. All right. Like this? Start paddling. OK, now pop up. Uh, sorry. What do I do from this downward dog position? Just drag your foot up under you. Yeah. Oh! You OK? I'm OK. Well, not bad for your first attempt. I fell. Oh. Oh, you're going to fall. Huh? So this is your leash. This is what will keep you from losing your board. OK. You know what? Why don't you just do a show and tell today. I'm actually a really good visual learner. Hey, remember, you have to let go of the fear and relax. And besides, I don't surf anymore. I might be an amateur, but there are two surfboards here. For me today, it's just a raft to go out with you. Now, stop stalling and start paddling. It's surprisingly peaceful out here. Yeah. It's a great time to learn. There's a groundswell building. Groundswell? What's that? It sounds kind of scary. Nah, it's just the opposite. Way out there, there's a storm, and it's sending you the most beautiful waves to learn on. Well, that's perfect timing. Speaking of which, when I tell you to paddle, you're going to look straight ahead and paddle as hard as you can. OK? And when I say pop up, you're going to do just what you did on the sand. I'm going to fall. You will fall. Like I said, just make sure you cover your head on your way up so that board doesn't hit you, OK? I don't know about this. Now, most importantly, stay relaxed. Have fun. Don't fight it. Trust me. I'll be right here to get you. OK, now get down on your board. Here comes a wave. OK, start paddling. Keep paddling, Emma! OK, now pop up! You OK? Yeah, I'm OK. Good because wipeouts are a big part of surfing. OK? Here comes another one. Ready? No, no. I'm Good for today. OK, surfer girl. You did great. No, I didn't. Well, an hour ago, you were terrified of the ocean. And you wiped out like a pro. So you should be proud of yourself. It's just the waves. They seem so much bigger out here than they do from the shore. You can't get in your own head about it. When I tell you to start paddling, you have to look forward. Trust that I have your back. OK. I will. Same time tomorrow? Um, yeah. So how was this morning? Mm, it was a little like Blue Crush 2 meet a washing machine. But a lot of fun. And how was my brother? You mean other than that sparkling personality? He totally Miyagied me. So how did you meet my aunt? Your Uncle Kai gave me a job at the rum distillery when we first moved here. Ah. That's amazing. Parsley, do I use the whole bunch? Sí. Todo. My aunt and uncle were just the most amazing couple, weren't they? They were my hashtag couple goals. Right? Who could live up to that? I used to think the same thing, chica. And then on a flight back from New Orleans to Hawaii, I met Sebastian. A flight attendant? Pilot. Oh, fancy. He showed me that true love is still alive and that we all deserve it. I can't wait to meet him. All right. Do you think I need to thin out the sauce a little bit? Oh, no. It looks perfect. OK, what's the scoop? What's the story? Tell me. Spill. Spill. There's nothing to spill. Other than I quit my job, I broke up with my boyfriend, and I ran away to Hawaii. Oh, is that all? Emma, you're gorgeous, kind. Obviously an amazing chef. I hope you know that. Oh, Franky, you're so sweet. I don't know. I thought I had everything I wanted lined up. But then it wasn't what it seemed or who he seemed. Anyway. Ooh, that chicken. That chicken's ready to come out. Oh. OK. Let me get the special sauce with it. Get it ready for you. Here we go. OK. Mm. Delicioso. Mm. Yep. That is so good. Absolutely perfect. So good. Mommy would be so proud. Everything OK? No. Maria, my partner for the competition, she slipped in the fish market and broke her arm. She has to drop out. Oh, no! That's horrible. I'm so sorry, Franky. Is she OK? She says she's OK. I'm going to bring her over some food later to check, but she can't cook with one arm, and there's no way that I'm going to find a partner before the competition starts. Seems to me like you already have. We do make a great team, and you're already cooking with a friend. That's all it would be, technically. So what do you say? I say we win. Ugh, why so early? I love surfing. I love surfing. I love surfing. I love surfing. A one, two, three, four. Surf. Surf. Surf is the only way I say to make music with the ocean day by day. I surf all day, play music all night, and I just can't wait till the morning light to go surf. You know, at least I didn't jump off this time. I just old school fell off. That's progress, right? That's huge. Now we've got to get you to stand up. But that's impossible without trust. I trust. Yeah? Then why do you keep looking back when I tell you that you have to look forward? What if you miss something? You've got to have faith, Emma. You can't control the ocean. You're not in charge over there, and that's... That's a good thing. You have to turn yourself over to the wave and just ride it. Go with the current, you succeed. Fight the current... Wipe out? Drown? I'm not going to let anything happen to you out there. I've got you. I should probably... I should go. Franky and I, we got to start practicing for the competition. We only have a few days left. Thanks for doing this with him. Oh, I just don't want to disappoint. Franky says you're an amazing chef. I'm sure you'll do great. You have to tell me everything about it, OK? So you've been talking to your brother about me? Well, you know, I mean, for insurance purposes. Very funny. Are you not coming? Somebody has got to watch over the staff at the cantina. Ben, where's your faith? Aloha, everyone. I am your host, Anuhea. You might know me as one of Hawaii's hottest local recording artists and self-proclaimed foodie. I'd like to welcome you all to the 10th annual Big Wave cook-off. Today, we have six incredibly talented culinary duos. Only four teams will move on to the next round. Those four teams will then fight it out for one of two spots in our finale, where we will name this year's winners, who will receive $50,000. You didn't say anything to me about prize money. Didn't I? Are you ready to meet your celebrity judges? Woo! She's a chef, cookbook writer, television personality, and now a best-selling author. Give it up for Katie Lee. Thank you, everyone. I'm so thrilled to be here. Our next judge left the bright lights of New York City to follow her heart all the way to Hawaii. She is a TV personality, top chef, and cookbook writer. Give it up for Lee Anne Wong. Hello, Hawaii. I am ready for something sweet and spicy. And finally, I'd like to introduce our celebrity mentor. We couldn't believe it when he signed on last minute. This chef will not be a part of the judges panel but will instead watch on as our team's cook, offering them priceless advice throughout the competition. He is the culinary world's favorite bachelor. Give it up for Garrett Weston. Oh, no, no, no, no. How is this happening? Wait, the ex-boyfriend is Garrett Weston? You're not just cute. You're also smart. Oh, no. Hey, Em. Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? It's fate. Can you believe it? No, I really, really can't. This was not on your schedule. Look, when you said you're coming to visit your aunt, I knew I had to come find you. Ever since you left, I've not been the same. Mucho gusto, Franky. So nice to meet you. Garrett. Good to meet you, too. Pleasure. Yeah. We should be prepping. I really miss you, Em. Well, I'm sure you can find a new chef de cuisine. That's not what I'm talking about. Ben, what are you doing here? Who's watching my restaurant? Oh, yeah? Nice to see you, too, man. Can't I come to support my little brother? And Emma, of course. How do you know Emma? Oh, I'm her surf instructor. Ben. You surf now? Yeah. Chefs, it's time for your first challenge. That's my cue. See you soon. Good luck, she's the best, you know. Oh, I know. Hey, break an egg. Today, you'll be using an ingredient from one of our sponsors, Ko Hana Rum. With us today is the owner of Ko Hana rum. Stand up, June Ko Hana. Each team will be making a dessert using rum from Ko Hana's distillery. It can be any dessert you want, but the rum needs to be the star of the dish. You have one hour, and your time starts now. All right, what are we thinking? OK, the first thing that comes to my mind is a Puerto Rican rum cake. But it's not going to be original enough to impress the judges. We need to incorporate some island flair. Right. OK. So maybe we elevate it by making a miniature version of it, almost like a petit four. Ooh, rum poppers. I love it. With a rum glaze on top? Oh, that's so good. And you know what? We can cut back on the sugar in the cake a little bit so I can make a macadamia coconut frosting to pipe inside. Ooh, we got this, chica. Yes. Let's go. I forgot to grab the cake pan. Oh, I'll grab one. Hey, Em. It looks like you didn't come to the island just to cook, huh? That is ready. Can you pour it in and get it in the oven? Yep. I'll start the glaze. Got it. Absolutely. 10 minutes left on the clock, chefs. Taste this. Delicioso. Let's plate. OK. Oh, that looks perfect. You greased the pan, right? Ah, Franky, I don't think I did. I am so sorry. I... I'm so sorry. It's just with Garrett, I got all distracted. It's all good. It's all good. We just need to come up with a plan. Five minutes left on the clock, chefs. You better start plating. And rapido. I have an idea. Hi. Hi. And what do we have here, Team South by Southeast? Today, we prepared for you an individual pineapple rum trifle layered with macadamia coconut frosting. And a rum glaze. Oh, well let's get in here. I think that your cake has a really nice texture to it, a good crumb. The frosting is perfectly sweet. However, I think your presentation is lacking. You know, I have to agree with Katie. But that being said, the flavor is delicious and on point. Thank you. Sorry. No. This was not your fault. You were fantastic today, and you made it to the next round. That's what matters. Thanks. Don't underestimate yourself, honey. You know, I usually don't. But it takes one negative comment from Garrett, and I just... Emma, my sweet child. You've got to stop giving that man so much of your power. When Garrett's not around, you're able to make showstopping meals. Why does his presence make you question your choices? Because he has so much experience, and his opinion holds a lot of weight for me. Darling, it's your own unique instincts that will get your ahead in this life. Your gut is the most reliable opinion you can get. Don't let Garrett keep you from seizing the day. Thank you. You're welcome. Good morning, Ben. Hey! Aloha, surfer girl. You're early. That's because I have decided today is the day I am finally going to stand up on my board. That's great, but... No, no. No buts. Nothing's standing in my way. I am ready. I just have one request. Sure. But Emma, I... You're going to surf today, too. Got to meet me halfway. Whatever you say, boss. The ground is not swelling today. It's totally flat today, actually. Did you know it was going to be flat? I tried to tell you, but you were a little too excited to hear me. It's for the best. My fearless confidence faded the second my toes his the water. You'll get there. Don't worry. Like I said, you've got to surrender to the waves. Well, I would have, if they'd actually shown up. Thanks for coming yesterday. Oh, yeah. Hey, that guy I met... Garrett. We were together for a while, and he made a bunch of promises he couldn't keep. It's not the kind of relationship I want. And what kind of relationship do you want? Honesty. Honesty would be really nice. Well, honestly, if it makes you feel better, I tried Garrett's frozen pizza line, and it tasted like cardboard. But not quite as good. What about you? What about me? Oh, come on. You know what? You do the brooding, mysterious thing very well, but if you want me to trust you, you've got to trust me, too. What would you like me to do, then? I would like you to tell me something about yourself that no one knows. Oh. Well, I'm actually a huge fan of Christmas movies. Everyone is a secret fan of Christmas movies. Come on. Stop deflecting. Tell me something real. Something... Something more like... Like? Like why don't you surf anymore? Because I don't feel like I deserve to. Ben, we're going to need more than that. You said one thing. Besides, I'm starving. You hungry? Always. What is this? Chinese beans. You know, Ricardo makes the best empanadas on the island. Really? Yeah. It's over there. I'll take you. OK. You know, I didn't realize there was such a strong Puerto Rican influence in Hawaii. Yeah, there is. Can I get these, please? Thank you. Yeah, yeah. Did you know that there are now over 50,000 Puerto Rican descendants living in Hawaii? Really? That's amazing. Yeah. It's a great story. In 1899, there was a devastating hurricane in Puerto Rico, and it destroyed all the sugar plantations. So because of this, there was a shortage of sugar in the world market, which then put a huge demand on the Hawaiian sugar production. So after that, the plantation owners started recruiting Puerto Ricans to the island. Two? It all started with 54 men that made a hard journey. When they arrived, it was even harder for them. But within a year, over 5,000 men, women, and children made Hawaii their home. Two of those settlers were my great-grandparents. Wow. And here we are. Thank you so much. Yes. Enjoy. Thank you. OK, wait. That is... I know. Perfect. That is... yes, perfect. These empanadas are incredible. So did your family come here, then? No, we moved here 12 years ago. You don't know who this is? Ben was trying to be number one on the circuit. He was brought over to compete and train. Full ride. The circuit. You mean surfing? Yeah. That was another time. Ricardo, gracias. Any time, amigo. Hey, and bring her back. I like her. Thanks. I can't believe this is where you live. Part time, at least. Most nights, I crash at the shop. Is that 10-minute commute just too much? Something like that. You thirsty? Yeah. I'd love some water. Your wish, my lady. Thank you. It is the best. You won't find this in Atlanta. No, I won't. What? Where is your kitchen? OK. Sorry. Slim pickings. That's my specialty. Did I see some scallions in your garden? I'm on it. Sorry. I'm... I'm really sorry. I was just looking for spoons, and... That's OK. That's... Your girlfriend. Of course. She's gorgeous, and as your friend, I think it's great. I mean, you're a surf instructor. You chop down coconuts from trees. Of course, you have a girlfriend. Wife, actually. She, uh... she passed away three years ago. Ben, I'm so sorry. No. It's OK. That looks delicious. Let's take it outside. The sun is going to set soon. Her name was Estrella. She had one of those presences that just lit up every room. Where did you two meet? She was actually my eighth grade pen pal in Puerto Rico. Wow, that's so sweet. Did she live far? No, just a couple of hours on the other side of the island. Our schools thought it would be a good way for us to work on our writing. Are you talking about actual letter writing, or emails? Oh, no, yeah. Old school letters. There was something about never having met in person that, just let us be totally honest with each other in those letters. So when the ninth grade spring dance came around, I worked up the courage and asked her to be my date. She said yes. So her mom drove her the two hours over to my school, and from the moment I met her, even though I was only 15, I... I knew I was going to marry her. After we got married, we would move to Hawaii for me to surf competitively. And still, we never stopped writing each other. Sometimes, we'd leave little notes in hidden places for the other one to find later. So it's hard for me to do the things I used to do that brought me joy. I don't think she'd want you to feel like you don't deserve to surf. It's not that simple. Well, we should probably get you back before June sends out a search party. So the market was abuzz this morning. Something about my brother having quite the day with a charming gringa. What? How? It was... Speaking of which, oh, look. We don't have any dish towels. I got to go get dish towels. Hey. Hey. Listen, I really wanted to apologize. No, no. I'm the one who needs to apologize. I know it's not coconuts, but... These are absolutely beautiful. Thank you. Aw. Hey, I just hadn't talked about Estrella in so long. Or at all, really. And I know you were just being a good friend. Yeah. No, of course. A friend. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's... and I'm always here, if you ever need to talk or anything. Yeah. Thank you so much for these. It's really sweet. I should probably get back to prepping. Yeah, yeah. Right. Right. Of course. Yeah. Good luck today. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, to day two of our competition. Chefs, four teams remain. But after today, only two teams will move on to the finale. Now for your challenge today, you will be cooking with one of Hawaii's native vegetables, the kalo, or taro root. The kalo needs to be the star of the dish. Your time starts now. All of my taro recipes are very traditional. Since the vegetable is local, I feel we should lean into the Southern flair. OK. Well, taro food is very similar in texture to a potato. So I created a take on Vermont potatoes at Garrett's that everyone went crazy for. So what if we fry the taro, we sub it for the potato. I think the flavors will come together really nicely. OK? Great. Vamos. How are you guys doing over here? Uh, we're fine, Chef. Thank you. You want to run anything by me? We are doing a dish based on Emma's take on brabant potatoes. Oh. Um, you sure you really want to do that? I am, Chef. Thank you. It's just you have such great recipes, Emma. I really think you should stand out from the rest. Well, thank you very much for your input. I'm going to grab our ingredients. Hey. Sorry to interrupt. Are you doing this brabant potato style? Yes, with a cashew aioli. It was Garrett's recipe. What are you guys doing? Not that. Good luck. I'll see you at the judges' table. Thanks. You, too. Oh, no. Oh, no. We've got to make a new dish. Are you crazy? Why? No, no. Mm. That is delicious. That sauce. It is a paprika cashew aioli. Wow. I'm going to have to get that recipe. Well done. Thank you, Chefs. And last but certainly not least, what do we have here? Today we have for you a mofongo de taro with a Creole mojo sauce. And a freshly picked hibiscus and mint iced tea. Mm. Smells delicious. You know, I love your presentation so much more today, and the twist you've done on the sauce is great. And your hibiscus mint iced tea is super refreshing. However, I feel like I want to see more of your personality in your food. Like, you two are holding something back right now. I agree. I think this is delicious, but mofongo is in your safety zone, and we're looking for you to step outside. This is good, but I'm not sure it's enough to keep you here. OK. Thank you. Thank you. You all cooked incredible meals today. But unfortunately, two teams have to leave us. The first team to be eliminated is the Spice Girls. It was so good. And the final team leaving us tonight is the Saucy Sauciers. South by Southeast, you are in the finale. I'm so happy for you guys. Thank you so much. So the Hawaiian ancestors believed this land was sacred. Somehow, it's remained untouched all these years. If you're lucky, you will feel a ho'ailona. Ho'ailona? What's that? It's a sign from the elements. Like a cloud or a breeze or even a bird that will guide you on your path. I like that. I always feel most connected to myself when I'm here. And I wanted you to see it. What a stunning view. Thank you for sharing it with me. Yeah. So you never mentioned. How long are you planning to stay here? That's a good question with not a very good answer. Well, while I still have you, we've got to get you to ride a wave. And how exactly are we going to do that here? You know what? I think I already understand the lesson without having to actually... you know, we can just go down the path. This was such a nice day. Um, it was such a good hike. You know, to be outside. Do you have any more stories about your ancestors, or... is this going to hold me? You guys are all set. Emma, I'm not going to make you do anything you don't want to do. Oh! Woo! Just for the record, I totally beat you. You had a head start. Oh, please. Keep telling yourself that, surfer boy. Oh, wait till the next surf lesson. You're going to get it. You have a beautiful life here, Ben. I do. I guess I just forgot. Hey, I... I know I shut down the other night. No. I said too much. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Thank you. It actually felt really good to talk about her again. I'm glad. It's not just the loss. It's that I wasn't around to say goodbye. Was it sudden? She was riding her vespa to the market when, out of nowhere, a truck run a red light. Oh, Ben. That's so horrible. I'm so sorry. But it sounds like there was nothing you could have done. She was conscious for another hour before she died. But they couldn't get a hold of me. I was at a hidden beach, surfing. And 38 missed calls later, while I was training, I lost the only chance to say goodbye. That's so heartbreaking. I'm sorry. I haven't... I haven't surfed since. I get it. I really do, in my own way. How so? My dad's an army officer. And five years ago, my parents were stationed overseas, but we all agreed to meet here for Christmas. But I canceled because of work. And, um, my mom had a sudden heart attack. And I never saw her again. That must have been so difficult. This is actually the first time I've come back since. And it was Aunt June who... I mean, my goodness, she's here, grieving her own sister's death. But we became really close, and she was the one who helped me realize I had to forgive myself. And that all my mom would want is for me to follow my dreams. And to be happy. Maybe someday, I'll get there. You were the one who taught me, the only way to make progress is to stop looking back and to look forward. A very wise surf instructor said you've got to ride the current. Fight the current, that's when you get in trouble. Said that, huh? I fo. It smells in here. It's like you can just feel the history. You certainly can. Can you believe the same method has been used to craft the rum since Kai's great-grandfather first built this place in the 1800s? That's unbelievable. You know, you're lucky. Not everyone finds what you and Uncle Kai had. Is Ben coming to the party? He hasn't mentioned it. We're just friends. You know, there was a time your Uncle Kai and I were just backgammon partners. Don't you have to wait a while after breaking up with someone before you start dating again? Says who? I'd just gone through a breakup when I met your uncle, and three months later, we were engaged. We had one of those instant connections. Aw. How does that saying go? If you want to make fate laugh, make a plan. What is it? Franky just texted, come to the beach stat. We came as quickly as we could. Is... what's going on? Is that... He's beautiful. I mean, his... his technique. It's incredible. No, you had it right the first time. Just beautiful. I don't know how to thank you, Emma. I haven't seen him this happy in a really long time. Oh, Junie, I have those pineapples. Oh, wonderful. Would you be a dear and load them into my car? Of course. Onward! Pineapples, we go! Hey. How long have you been here? Long enough to understand why you're considered the best surfer on the island. Eh, I'm a little rusty. No, you're not. You are... Starving. Wow. Are you kidding me? Thanks. You know, this... this reminds me of my mom's cooking. Really? Did your mom cook Southern food? No. But she made delicious food that was full of love. Oh, hello, you two. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Although if I am, I wouldn't be mad about it. Hi, June. We're just having a bite. What are all these pineapples for? So I decided that we should serve piña coladas at the party tomorrow. It was your uncle's favorite. He would love that. On that note, I got to get back to the distillery. This party won't throw itself. Wait, what about these pineapples? You two get dicing. We need lots. You know your husband's amazing, right? Oh, yes, I do. Why put a ring on it. We've had so much fun cooking together. We have. And I can't wait for the finale. And we are definitely going to come visit you. When are you leaving, anyway? I don't know. I should probably start figuring that out. Sounds like somebody's falling in love with the island. Among other things. Stop. If you'll excuse me for a second. Wow, wow, wow. You look stunning. Thank you. You look... Hungry. I know. I was going to say handsome. I wanted to thank you for our talk the other day. It really helped me. I'm so glad. You've really helped me. I feel like myself again. I feel like I can go home and take on anything that comes my way. Right. You're leaving soon. Yeah, but I've got to ride a wave first. Well, as a instructor, I should want that to happen as soon as possible. But selfishly, I wouldn't mind if it took a while longer, you know. I wouldn't mind, either. I've... I've grown quite fond of my surf instructor. If I'm being honest, I can't stop thinking about him. Is that so? Because there's this student that I can't get out of my head, either. Emma, there you are. I've been looking for you everywhere. It's really not a good time. I'm so sorry to interrupt. Listen, I really need to speak to you, Ems. You're going to love this. Trust me. Can't it wait? I'm going to go grab us a drink, OK? I'm so sorry. No. I'll find you in a bit. OK. Come with me. Look, I've been thinking about what you said, and I owe you an apology. What's the catch? I'm serious. My ego made it hard for me to see clearly. I know I didn't handle things right with you. Thank you for saying that. I have an offer for you. What is this? It's everything you ever wanted. What are you talking about? So I had a call with my investor group earlier today, and they were going on and on about how excited they are about the food at Garrett Weston's bistro. And they wanted to know what new restaurant I'm going to open in Atlanta. And I told them it would be yours, under your name. I mean, part of the Garrett Weston collection, of course. But you'd have complete creative control and you would finally get the chance to present your recipes as your own. That... wow. That's a lot. That's... I don't want you to do me any favors, though, Garrett. It's not a favor. It's a smart business. And it's what you deserve. Look, even if you win this competition, that's not enough for you to open your own restaurant. It's the least I can do. I don't know what to say. Say you'll give me another shot, as a business partner. Thank you for this, Garrett. Really, thank you. But I have to think about it. Of course. But I need to let them know by tomorrow, so 24 hours, you could have your own restaurant. Sorry to interrupt back there. No worries, man. I actually want to thank you. Yeah? Why's that? Well, you know, you've had such a great effect on Emma. And because of you, she's in a great place to live out her dreams. I'm so glad. She has had such a great effect on me, too. You know, actually, when her and I come back to Hawaii, maybe you should take us both out for a lesson, huh? I didn't think you and Emma were spending much time together these days. Well, I mean, it's a bit hush hush, but it looks like we might be opening up another restaurant again over in Atlanta. Yeah. I just surprised her with the contracts. Yeah. I mean, I've been promising her for years but finally came through. And she said yes? She did not say no. But you know, she's looking it over. Cheers. I'm so confused. He's offering me everything I've ever wanted on a silver platter. Somehow, it feels like it could be silver plated. I know. You're probably right. I mean, his apology seemed genuine, but my own restaurant. It's just... Ben? Ben. I'm sorry to interrupt. Emma, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, of course. I'll go grab a shrimp canape. I'm really sorry about earlier. No worries. It seemed like it was important. Garrett filled me in, actually. He did? Yeah. Congratulations. I haven't made any sort of decision yet. Ben, there's a lot to consider. What's to consider? This is your dream, right? Yeah, it is. But you've shown me... Don't worry. I'll be here to give you lessons next time you come to the island. Wait, lessons? No. I haven't said yes yet. But you should. And I'm sorry, but I... I can't do tomorrow's lesson anymore. New inventory coming in. But the waves are supposed to be ideal, so you should still surf, OK? Alone? You got this, Emma. You don't need me. Maybe things weren't as intense as I thought with Ben. Are you trying to convince yourself or me? Because you're never going to convince me that you and Ben aren't falling in love. Love? I think you're getting ahead of yourself. Am I? I see the way you two look at each other. Honey, he looks at you like Kai looked at me. You and Uncle Kai had a love that was very rare. I think I'm more used to the kind of love that starts out as a romantic fairy tale and then ends up with me getting kicked out of the castle. Not every relationship is the one you had with Garrett. Yeah. You and Uncle Kai had it. Our relationship was hard work. We could get through anything, as long as we stayed honest and kind to each other. Unconditional trust. Trust. Yeah. That's a hard one for me. I feel like every time I open up and let go, the rug just gets pulled out from under me. I really think you need to trust yourself. Just stand on your own two feet. And I know, it sounds cliche, but listen to your heart. I've got to keep the calm before the storm. I don't want less. I don't want more. Must bar the windows and the doors to keep me safe, to keep me warm. Groundswell, you're mine today. I can't see in the stormy weather. I can't seem to keep it all together. And I can't swim the ocean like this forever. And I can't breathe. God, keep my head above water. I lose my breath at the bottom. Come rescue me. I'll be waiting. I'm too young to fall asleep. So God, keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar as I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. And keep my head above water above water. So how long are you going to be gone for? I don't know. It depends on the surf. Uh, Kawaki is going to start filling in at the shop starting tomorrow. I'm sorry I can't be there today, man. Sorry? You're not sorry. Dude, what are you doing? I told you. I don't want to stand in the way of her dreams. It's easier this way for everyone. Easier? Easier for who? For you, maybe. This is not what Emma wants. And you know what Emma wants? I'm trying to protect her. The Emma that I know doesn't need protection. Look, Ben. We all know you suffered a huge loss. No one's going to take that away from you. You have a chance for a new story. And just because you're starting to feel something doesn't mean you have to run. Panic a little, maybe, pero aren't you tired? When is this going to be enough? Estrella, she would want you to be happy. Can you please just give Emma this note for me. Franky, por favor. Be careful, brother, because the bed you are making, you are the one who's going to have to lie in it, alone. Seriously? You're not the one who lost everything that day. The day Estrella died was horrible. But I lost her, and my brother. I'm right here. Really, Ben? Because all I see is a ghost. You know what? I am tired of making excuses for you and sticking up for you. No. I'm not going to do that anymore. I won't watch you blow your second chance. I won't. Can't you see, I'm doing this for her? Just keep telling yourself that, and maybe one day, you're going to believe it. Just go. It's what you do best now. You know what? Sink or swim, you're on your own. Franky, come on. You're my brother. That's right. I'm your little brother. But I really miss having my big brother around. You don't understand. I'm not going to go through that again. I can't. Oh, I understand perfectly. But I'm out of here because I got people counting on me. Mi amado, Ben. How long did it take you to find this note? Do we already have kids? It doesn't matter when you find it because I know our love is eternal. Remember when you asked me to prom? You told me you had to choose between love and fear. You chose love, and I'm so grateful that you made that same choice every day since. Te amo, your pen pal, Estrella. Yes. Chef, I really appreciate all the advice you've given all week. No worries. The judges like what you're doing, so keep it up, yeah? Stay creative. Thank you. Hey, Em. Good morning, partner. Did you bring the papers? Garrett, your offer is incredibly generous. And I know that it took a lot for you to do that for me, and I'm so grateful. But I can't accept it. What? I really think this is something I need to do on my own. Do you realize what you're passing up here? Yes. It's the dream. But I also realize I've been underestimating myself for a long time. And I was really convinced that I needed you in order to succeed. And I've learned that what I really need is I need to trust my own instincts. And they're telling me that this is a journey I have to take without you. Truth is, you're ready, Em. Thank you, Garrett. Really, thank you. Hey, go get 'em. See you out there. Good morning, Mr. Diaz. Buenos días, Miss Dawson. Hey, have you heard from Ben? I haven't been able to reach him. He left to go surf on the other side of the island. I'm sorry, Em. Really? Oh, well, do you know for how long? No, mi amor. He left this for you. Hello, Team South by Southeast. It's the big finale today. How's everybody feeling? We're feeling great, Katie. Thanks. Yeah, just trying to get our heads in the game. Any words of wisdom for us? If I can give you one piece of advice, it would be to cook with your heart, not your head. Whatever you're feeling, put it into the food. Good luck out there. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, to the final day of the Big Wave cook-off. Chefs, it's time for your final challenge, which will determine this year's winners. Today, you'll be asked to prepare not just one, but two dishes... Something savory and something sweet. Now, your savory dish should be something that represents where you came from. The sweet dish should be something that represents where you are today. Now, remember, this is your final challenge, so don't hold anything back. And you know the drill. The time starts now. Mm. Ham and plantains in a dumpling. Now, that's one I wouldn't have thought of. Really good. And your dessert, so stylish and modern. I clearly see you've taken Garrett's input. This is going to be a tough dish to beat. Mm hmm. Team South by Southwest, tell us about the savory dish that represents where you both came from. Today, we made for you grilled ajillo shrimp with grits, smoked Gouda, bacon, and a touch of culantro. This is a combination of our mother's recipes that we love. It represents both of our childhoods. And tell me about your sweet dish that represents where you are now. We made a tropical fruit pavlova. It represents where we are physically, this beautiful island with the incredible beaches. But it also represents where we are symbolically. Waves, like life's challenges, can seem really scary from the shore, but once you learn to ride them, they're a lot gentler than you think. This is the final round. We asked you to make dishes that were both exciting and innovative. And not only did you do that, but you also gave us dishes that come from your heart. I can really taste the love in these. Delicious. Well done. You guys not only nailed the flavor and the presentation, but we love your background story on both your dishes. This is going to be a really tough decision. Sure is. Thank you. Thank you. Chefs, you all did an incredible job. We'll announce the winners shortly. Please return to your stations. Cook-off and $50,000 is Team South by Southeast. Oh, my god! We did it! Ya! Oh, my god. You're so amazing. Congratulations. Thank you so much, Katie. Thank you so much. I'm so excited for you guys. I don't want to bother you right now, but how about the three of us grab dinner tomorrow night? I have a little proposition I'd like to talk to you about. For sure. What about Mercedes Cantina at 6:00 PM? Oh, that works for me. Thank you so much, Katie. Perfect. See you there. Thank you so much. We did it! Oh, my goodness. We did it! We did it! Hey. you two. Oh, thank you so much. Oh! Just... It was... So happy brilliant. Thank you. Hola, it's Ben. Leave a message. Ben! Hey, it's Emma. Listen, I know you're out surfing, but I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you supporting my dreams. And I also wanted to let you know that I stood up today. I rode a wave, all by myself. And I... You did? You're here! I'm sorry I'm late. You guys were incredible. Congratulations. Thank you. And you caught a wave? I did. Look at you, Gidget. What are you doing here? I thought you were away, surfing. I was. But an hour into my drive, I realized that I was running... Against the current? You can't fight the waves, Ben. You got to surrender to them. And so I'm surrendering to the fact that I'm in love with a woman who needs to leave here and go live out her dreams in Atlanta. I turned Garrett down. But I thought he was offering you everything you ever wanted. Not everything. Hot biscuits behind, behind. Tracey. Oh! I've got a call. One second. Hola, chica. How's my restaurant doing? Burn anything yet? How's my restaurant doing? You break anything yet? Oh, Katie Lee came in last night. She loved how you built that open oven behind the bar. Oh, that's great. I mean, she was the inspiration. Oh, listen, I've got to go. But send my love to Sebastian, and do not over-stir... The biscuits. I know. I know. Ciao. Love you, bye. Sheridan, hi. What are you doing here? Can a man come to Hawaii and review the hottest new restaurant? Yes, he can. Are you here alone? I could not decide. And no, I came with my wife and son. They're taking surf lessons right now. Did you know you have some really great surf instructors here? I did. Is it true that you and Franky came up with this idea over dinner with Katie Lee? Yeah. I spent the last six months getting the Atlanta restaurant up and running, and then Franky did the same thing here. And then we switched I love the concept of you two switching between sister restaurants. That's the best of both worlds, I would say. You know what? Couldn't have said it better myself. Listen, I wanted to let you know in person that I'm writing a full front page feature on you both. Sheridan, that means the world to me and Franky. We're just so... we're so happy you love our food. By the way, Emma, I know it was you. Sorry? That night at the bistro, I know it was you who made me that spectacular meal. How? When I left my phone behind, later I realized it was still recording. I'm just glad you're finally getting the credit you deserve. I can't tell you how much that means to me. I actually have to be somewhere. So if you'll excuse me, please enjoy. And June can get you anything else you need. This is our signature mango mojito. On the house. Enjoy. Nice groundswell starting. It's perfect. Ready, surfer boy? Yes, Chef.
