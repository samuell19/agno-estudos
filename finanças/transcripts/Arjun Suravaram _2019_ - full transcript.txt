We recently did a sting operation in a pub We found some students from schools and colleges taking drugs there Upon further investigation, we came to know they are your children Play the footage Don't worry My intention is not to scare you. Then why have you called us here? To extort money? How much do we need to pay up to stop this telecast? As much as you will need to help your kids transform Be assured this footage will never be telecast You are spending all your money on your children, please spend some of your time too Hitting or scolding them will not make a difference. Instead, sit with them, talk to them Spend some time with them. Please He's always like this, dear. Arjun once asked me, if I need four days' worth of sensational news or would I rather save four lives I agree with his school of thought Since he was not supposed to name the channel during a sting operation, he must have lied to you about being a BBC reporter Working at BBC is his dream. He told me so when he joined this channel That's why I agreed to give him the work footage for his application It's ok if we can't help him, but let's try not to come in his way Hello interview for the post of investigative journalist in British Broadcasting Corporation, that is BBC, We have sent a formal email to you Ok May I come in Sir Yes, please come in Have a seat Thank you Mr. Arjun, this opening is for an investigative journalist It's all about how deeply you can investigate and how well you present the case Mr. Arjun, we have a case for you to analyze It's a case of a young lady, her name was Christine She was found dead having fallen from the eighth floor of her apartment building The door was locked from the inside and there were no traces of any visitors on the security cameras You need to investigate whether this is a suicide or a murder and as an investigative journalist, how you will present this news in a sensational manner Sir, one more time please What? One more time? Is this a movie to show you again and again? It's an interview man. You have a language problem That's the reason for your hesitation and fumbling People like you do not understand unless there are Telugu subtitles A girl died falling from the eighth floor Main door is locked from inside There is no evidence in the security cameras of anyone visiting her As an investigative journalist, you should find out whether this is a murder or a suicide And how are you going to present this case as a sensational news These South Indian reporters are not capable of presenting in English Sir What's happening in whose bedroom... Christine, the victim, was found dead, jumping from the eighth floor of the City Tower Apartment However this is considered to be a suicide by the City Police But, we do have a few clues, that'll prove this was not a suicide but a very well planned murder The victim Christine had freshly painted toe nails As you can see all the toe nails on the right leg have been painted But on the left leg, only three of them have been painted, leaving two unpolished Also the nail polish bottle has been left open on the table in her living room Nobody would even care to paint their toe nails before killing themselves Reports suggest that there were no traces of any visitors in that apartment But there were two cups of coffee on that table Which shows us the victim was not alone but had company And this person would've been a friend As you can see, the door was also locked from inside Which clearly tells us a fact that he or she was not just a friend, but more than a friend to her And surprisingly if you all notice, the security camera footage was all deleted And even more surprisingly, there was no sign of any struggle at all which leads us to the conclusion that this was not a suicide but a very, very well planned murder This is Arjun Suravaram, reporting for BBC news English is just a language Sir, not knowledge Mr. Arjun We been Selected Congratulations Thank you sir.. Thank you One Second, One Second Congratulations - Thanku Sir, You made our TV99 proud If tomorrow, someone asks you which channel did you work for previously, you must say TV99 - Claps - Sure Sir Congrats, you achieved it He should be your role model, understood Got it, Sir-Yes Sir Kavya is the one who sent your work footage to BBC Thank you for sending across the footage, Kavya Please keep your 'thank you' to yourself Are you still angry with me? What I said to you is no more a lie, but a reality now. A lie is always a lie Correct, but hiding the truth is equally wrong No one here is hiding any truth Is that so? Then why did you chat with me at the ice cream store? - Because I knew you You asked for my phone number. - Because I had some work You call me every day? - Because I don't have anything else to do Why did my lie make you cry? I need to go Where to? Personal What personal? None of your business Arjun! BBC cake, dude! Cut it Cut it! What are you waiting for?

You have no right to hit without a reason Who are you? I'm a lawyer and this is my ID card I'm Arjun's friend Who are you? I'm Arjun's father, Sir What's the reason to arrest them Sir? Education loan forgery These five idiots cheated banks and took education loans They submitted fake documents to prove they are studying MBA and MS in London's Cambridge University These guys individually have cheated five different banks. Not one or two rupees but a total of 13 Crore rupees 13 crores? They planned and looted Sir, I haven't taken any loan in any bank Sir Hey, do not interrupt when sir is talking Sir, what proof do you have that they are the culprits? Hey, get the documents These are the documents they submitted to the bank Duplicates that look exactly like the originals Fake Degree Certificates, fake school certificates, fake passport, driving license, PAN card, ration card... They didn't leave anything out They made all fakes and cheated five banks My certificates, my ID proofs and my signatures All these are mine Sir That's why we arrested you Sir, those education loans must have been transferred into some bank account Did you check those account numbers? All those accounts are on their names. We couldn't trace them so far as wrong addresses were stated in those bank accounts Three days ago, as part of BBC's background verification process, his address was provided to us That's how we caught him Using the same method, we collected the details of all those whose background verification was done in the last one year, from all Police stations in Hyderabad And that's how we caught hold of all these guys Sir, my son works in a software company He has nothing to do with BBC Sir There's been some mistake somewhere Software Company! Do you know where he works? In Infosys Company Sir Huh! It's been one year since your son quit that job He joined as a reporter in TV99 Father is not even aware of what the son is doing Sir, please Not just the banks but he cheated even you Is this true?

Leave him Sir Go, Please Sir, Hit him At least you tell him, Subba Rao Please Sir, -ask them to let him go, Please Sir, leave him Beat him up! - I beg you Sir After examining the preliminary evidence, it is clear that these five conspired and cheated the banks With no fear of law or punishment, such crimes are on the rise This crime cannot be excused they are sentenced to one year of imprisonment under section 120B of IPC and another six years under sections 417 and 420 for cheating the banks In total, they shall be sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment This special court orders them to deposit the loot amount of 13 crores within 10 days, To discourage anyone from attempting such forgeries in future, this special court issues an interim order to cancel the certificates of the accused The court is adjourned I didn't commit any mistake Sir Sir, please Sir Sir how will you recover the 13 crores?

What are you saying, son? I don't understand what is happening When will you deposit the surgery fee? How long can we postpone the operation? Is this a charity home where you can stay free of cost? No sir, my son will come today for sure The chief doctor has asked us to discharge your husband, if you don't pay the money by tomorrow Why don't you go to Government hospitals, instead of troubling us like this? Why do you come to harass us? Karthik You took great troubles to educate me, mom But, I am of no use to you now. - Don't say such things, dear No mom, it doesn't matter if I live or die My life is a waste, mom Who is that on the phone, Lakshmi?

We often see Chit fund and Credit Card scams but the new scam on the block, is Education Loan forgery Is making news. Police have arrested the five graduates behind this scam One of the accused died trying to escape by jumping out of the police van After this incident, the other four have been granted a conditional bail with self guarantee Police are now also questioning bank officials as a bank Manager is reported missing. Looks like this case is getting more and more complicated No BBC nothing, I just need my son to stay safe with me This incident leaves parents worried about the future of their children Balaji Take these house documents, Uncle Sell this house and everything in it at whatever price and get the money we need Take this and Let us pay the court's fine and be done Let us not stay here anymore. Let us go to a place where no one recognizes us Hey, what is this senseless talk? Will selling the house or paying the court fine solve our problem? We will achieve nothing All the education you provided to your son with such great difficulty, is now void The Court has stamped your son's certificates as fake Your son today is as good as an uneducated idiot He will never get a job in his life He will have to beg or live as a daily wage labourer You have to submit all your certificates in a week You are aware this is an international channel If all documents and procedures are not perfect, we will not confirm you for the job Its in your hand. Arjun, these are the case details I have collected In this case. Along with five of you, there are four youth in Khammam, four in Rajahmundry, two from Nizamabad and two more in Guntur who have been arrested under similar charges And we don't know how many more out there have been arrested Arjun, these documents tell us the students are from different cities and different colleges They have no link to each other But they are all tied together by the same conspiracy Arjun, we need to find out who is behind this Do not think link a victim Arjun, think like a reporter What happened Arjun? The photo on this original certificate and on that fake certificate in the Police station is the same Not just that, in fact, this same photo exists on all the loan papers as well Do you think the certificates and photos were leaked from your college? It is highly impossible for such a leak to occur from a Government College If not from the college, then where? Leak from JNTU means... Balaji, in addition to my certificates, I did use this same photo at another place Where? DoT consultancy Hey flower - seller What, Sir? This consultancy office is closed, When do they open? No idea Sir, it is closed since a long time Hey, I am trying to find out and why did you have to break the lock meanwhile? There will be trouble if someone spots me in my uniform here If this is closed from long as she says it is, why is this lock so new? It means someone is coming here, on the sly. Hey, you stand guard outside, Ok Let us go inside Hey, won't this shutter go any further up? Why is the place so big, dude? Look thoroughly everywhere We should not miss a single paper We have searched everywhere and cannot find a single clue I didn't find any clue either I already told you Arjun, the certificates must have been leaked from your college Listen to me and let us quickly get out of here What is this Arjun, looks exactly like an original certificate? Oh My God! B Sc, B Com, B Tech, MBA... All kinds of certificates are here Hey, this is an MBBS certificate dude! I think I have seen this Doctor somewhere Arjun, look here. Holograms of all Universities! The holograms are original. To print these, one must definitely have Government license Arjun, look so many stamps here Nagarjuna University, Osmania University, JNTU, Andhra University, Kakatiya University, All the Universities! Stamps of every University are here But these certificates are not enough to get a loan from the bank. One will need more documents There are only certificates here. I do not understand this Arjun. Don't you still get it? As we suspected, they are not just taking education loans based on fake education certificates. They are even Selling these fake certificates This is a BIG scam Now, I remember. Last month I had gone to this guy for Malaria vaccine and he injected here instead of giving it here I had such a big swelling, I was suspicious then itself. At the outset, this Consultancy seems like it is aiding students But in reality, it is only ruining their lives! Just like it ruined my life, Frauds! Rascals! Then there must be so many fraud Doctors and fraud Engineers all across our society We should somehow get a hold of this, Arjun Yes, there are photos on the certificates We can trace them and know who they are How will we trace them with just these photos? How will we know where and which department they belong to? This is very tough. This is practically impossible It Is possible Including our channel, there are 44 satellite channels in total across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Of them, 17 are News channels, where we know reporters and these reporters know, friends, their friends of friends... There will be at least one person we know in every channel, We should take their help Kavya, email these fake certificate details to everyone. Ok Just ensure the News must be telecast on all news channels on the same day, at the same time and in the same manner Why at the same time? We will be safe only if we do so Won't there be a problem if news is unofficially telecast in this manner? I am counting on that. For only when a problem arises, we find a solution Ok dude, but what news should we telecast? In the raids by special task force in Hyderabad, many fake certificates have been seized Many of those imposters may be employed in Government and private sectors We are now going to show you their details His name is Ramakrishna and is 32 years old.

All certificates are from our Ameerpet branch, Pa Who is In-charge of that branch? I am that branch's in-charge, but I have no connection with what has happened Wait a minute.

Looks like he is talking to someone he knows well I am suspicious about this I asked you to wait, right? Hey, give him your visiting card Where is this address Sir? Will you take an insurance policy from me if I help you? Of course, I will What a fool! Agreed to take a policy in return for an address This idiot is believing my offer I will give you benefits which I have never offered to anyone He has given him a piece of paper and is talking to him. I think he is the one we are looking for. Can you also get your family and friends to take policies from me? They will take it right away Sir, What? In fact, should I share some shocking news?

Brother, he is an insurance agent An Insurance agent? Hey, that lawyer is playing around with us. Finish him off Ok brother Why did you beat me so much for just asking an Aadhar card? Hey, our plan worked well, They are following me They have changed their plan now, They are not coming to kidnap you They are coming to kill you What? Kill me? Do something, dude.

Bring that fellow Sir, please Sir Lock it I am sorry Sir Sir, please Sir Bring him in I told you to deliver the goods quickly, didn't I? Shabana, get inside now Pa, we kidnapped that lawyer. He wanted to trick us and escape I felt like killing him right there, But someone came to save him That's why we kidnapped and brought him here. Idiot, you did not kidnap him, instead he tricked you into this kidnap You should have brought that guy instead What he needs is evidence, He will surely come looking for it Before he reaches, Kill this fellow Make sure he does not get any evidence. Burn everything Hey, tie his hands and legs Throw in all the files and burn him along with them Let him and the evidence turn to ashes Let's have a drink? What? A Drink dude Police raids are on at various places across the state, in connection with this scam Crime branch officials have sealed all branches of Dot Consultancy They are going to investigate the case Officials have begun investigation into those involved in this scam All students with original certificates fear they may be pulled into this scam It is now confirmed that Dot Consultancy is involved in the Education loan scam Four branches of Dot Consultancy have been sealed Banks have decided to temporarily keep education loans in abeyance because of this scam What is the update on the scam, Sir? Has the body found at Dot Consultancy been identified yet? Our investigation reveals the deceased's name is Ram alias MK He migrated from Burma to India. We do not have any further information at this time Sir, do you have a picture of the man found dead? Here is his picture Hey, That photograph is of somebody else! What? This man was not even present there, at that time. They have meticulously planned the dead body swap. Who is this man? What happened to the actual dead body? Have you identified who the 52 fake certificates belong to? All 52 certificates alleged by TV channels, to be fake have been proven to be original in our verification Here is the evidence We suspect someone is intentionally feeding fake news to media If any news channel engages in such fake news broadcasts again, we will take legal action Thank you Sir, sir... Please Sir Stop Sir, We need an answer Please sir, tell us Arjun, how did all those fake certificates turn original suddenly? Something is not right I can vouch a genuine background verification was conducted They did call up every college to check authenticity. All certificates are original What? I feel we are barking up the wrong tree If that was so, why did they kidnap Balaji? And the evidence? Why did they burn all the evidence? Why did they change the dead body? There is a huge network behind this And there will always be ONE mastermind for every network The man killed in Dot Consultancy must be some one important for them That must be the reason they switched the bodies He will definitely come looking for us No matter who he is or where he is, I will show him hell After pulling off a Rupees 9000 Crore scam, Vijay Mallya too left India peacefully What is your scam compared to him? And yet, how hard are you trying, weaving stories of murders, changing dead bodies and so on? What are all these scripts for? Leave it Sir, you will get angry If I say something I will get angry even if you do not say anything There is no logic in what you are saying You say that your certificate was leaked from Dot Consultancy All the other 52 certificates were also found at the same Consultancy If your certificate is original, then those 52 certificates can be original too, right? Who is there? I am asking who is there? Why don't you speak? Did you find any evidence? Police checked everything and they found no evidence of who had broken in No evidence even in the forensic report. It is very clean There should definitely be finger prints of our men, at least. If even those are missing in the report, he must have erased it all No matter how smart someone is, he will certainly commit a mistake. Search this entire place Motion capture camera 180 degree motion sensor and 3 frames per second Whoever moves in front of this camera, it automatically clicks a picture He put this camera here to find out who we are. Now this same camera will lead us to him Arjun! Arjun Arjun! What happened? What happened, brother? Arjun! Arjun! Son Arjun careful careful Arjun, My son Arjun, My son What happened to you? Arjun! Arjun! Police came exactly at 4:21pm How did the Police get to know? The control room got a call from an unknown number Police acted on that tip off. He escaped in a Police jeep, he may be a Cop, right? If he was a cop he would either work for money or fame. If he wanted fame, he would have bragged about it on TV, if he wanted money, he would've come to us. He is not a cop. If he is not Police, how come without an FIR, news about fake certificates was telecast in all the channels, at the same time, in the same manner? Same time? Yes, all channels telecast the news at the same time. But that is common, right? Name Ramakrishna - Age 32 Name Sukumar, age 33 - Sagar, age 27 It is common to be telecast on the same day, but not common if it comes at the same time He should either be wielding influence in the media or should be someone working in the media. Maybe he is a reporter! It was telecast on 13 channels in total, how will we know which channel does he report for? Collect details of all the reporters who telecast this fake news. I will find out who he is Arjun! Dear husband How are you feeling? What are you doing son? Mom, I need to go Where do you have to go, son? You may be fearless, but you should think of your parents too, right? Arjun, it is not safe for you to go out at this time. Kavya, they can say something like that because they do not know. But how can you say that too? What is there to understand? What if that bullet had not missed its mark? Can you imagine what could have happened? I always told you that not to take up this reporter's job This society does not need the good you do, son. Let us leave the good and bad to the public, Let us just tell them the truth Truth! Huh, do you know what the truth is? In the last 10 years, 73 reporters like you were killed in this country, trying to expose some scam or the other. Not even one case has been solved. No body has been punished, No body remembers even the names of those journalists This is THE truth here That is why we fear for your safety, son I understand your pain father but I need to go You all have gone mad behind TRPs. Trying to sell the news, you are selling away your souls. What you are doing is not journalism but prostitution. After my release on bail, I started collecting all the news on fake certificates. Separately each of these instances may look like just another news item. I did not understand till I collated all the news articles and I found that this is a huge scam Look here. Almost 15 Lakh students are passing out every year in our Telugu states Just 6 Lakh of those students are getting jobs The other 9 Lakh students are ending up on streets, jobless The reason for all this is each of these fake certificate guys in this room Father, you are feeling bad about the 73 reporters who died But do you know how many people died because of just this one fake engineer? Stop stop stop, Yes, I stopped Brother Vamsi Yes dear? Is the new school building inaugurated yet? Not yet dear, we are all waiting for MLA sir Is it? Yes Sir Then who is he? He is the Engineer who constructed this school Is it? Sir, hello Sir Ok That is fine dear, why did your teacher call me? Nothing Dad, she has a small doubt What is the doubt? To know whether you are the one who signed my progress report or not Yes, I did not sign it right? I signed it. Why did you sign dear? Did you get less marks? No Dad, I always come first in my class Then, why did you sign on my behalf dear? All my friends are making fun of me looking at your thumb impressions on my progress card, Dad Yes, MLA sir is here Dad, you come too Careful dear Where are you, man? Sir, I have come to drop my daughter at the school. I will be there in half an hour Sir Workers are waiting, come fast Not just here, but we will construct such high quality schools in all districts. Hey, what? Our Government's main intention is that Here, see Sir Oh .. This is just an air crack and is very common in any new building Thank God, I was worried Sir Don't worry These kids are our future... I will meet you later Sir, they are small kids. Better we alert them right away and send them out Sir They will thrash us if we tell them now Let us come in the evening and get it repaired Hey... Hey... Children, go out. Fast, fast. Move fast kids Divya Come on. Go! Oh no! Come out fast, Ramu Come fast, come out Divya Daddy Divya Divya Chinnu, move Get up Daddy! Divya I always come first in my class All my friends are making fun of me looking at your thumb impressions on my progress card, Dad Baby Divya Divya Divya God! That day along with Divya, 43 other children got crushed and died under the rubble, unable to breathe, Dad What was their mistake? Not just fake Engineers, Doctors, College Professors, Railway Engineers, Bank managers, Pilots, Software Engineers, Lawyers, Builders, Police Officers... There are fake certificate employees in every department When so many lives were snuffed out because of just this one fake Engineer, how many must have died because of all these people here? Then isn't the prostitution you mentioned better than all this, Dad? It is terrible that the Engineer was arrested but walked free in just two weeks Arjun I was angry because of my love for you But now, after listening to what you said, I am angrier at these people. If an individual makes a mistake, only he may be ashamed But when such large number of people commit a mistake, the whole society stands ashamed In my service, I have only seen reporters who toe the boss's line, but for the first time, I see a committed reporter in you. I feel very proud, son Do not leave any of these criminals. Whatever happens, I will stand by you. Yes, I was the one who dealt with that school collapse case In any case, usually, we get some small evidence at least. But, we didn't get any clue in this case Even that Guru Murthy's certificate passed the background verification What's this Sir? Can't we do anything when so many innocent kids have been killed? Law doesn't care for emotion my dear, It cares only for evidence Get some evidence and I'll ensure justice. There are only two things for us to do now One is to get hold of Guru Murthy or to prove his certificate is fake When there are so many 'fake' idiots, why are we only targeting Guru Murthy? Because Guru Murthy's certificate is one of the 52 certificates we found at Dot Consultancy But where will we find him? A guy who gets away with a crime shall certainly commit the same crime again Hey, Uncle and you go and find out if there are any new constructions underway, in his name We'll find out how is he passing off his fake documents as original Metro rail project! Its raining revenues for Metro rails due to the ongoing RTC strike. Trains are all looking overcrowded with passengers. Who gave the news of fake certificates, telecasted on November 27th? Tell me Bang Bang NTv reporter received the news from ABN channel's reporter. I had to tell your name in connection with the fake certificate news telecast on November 27th.

It's perfect Sir, has Engineer Sir Come? - No, he hasn't Every certificate will have a unique number That won't repeat in another certificate Why wouldn't they verify the photo on the certifcate, Sir? He must have been 20 when this photo was clicked. By now, he'd be 45 years old He also won't recognise himself unless we tell him.. Correct Sir, My photo on Aadhar card looks like Prabhas! What? Almost! See, the certificate you gave matched in our University database This certificate belongs to Mr. Guru Murthy This is definitely an original certificate Sir, has he come? No, man I'll tell it's the TV 9 reporter Tyvek Paper, Germen ink, one can somehow source all these from black market, But how can a fake certificate made by a random guy get validated in back ground verification.

Business class Does he need business class now? Cost will go up if it is needed immediately I'll pay once my certificate is given Srinu, I have reached safely. You go carefully ♫ I'm searching and I will catch you ♫ We shouldn't bring outsiders here, but since you said it's urgent I'm not doing it for money, but only to help you Such a big setup!

His name is Arjun I am checked his flight ticket.. He needs to leave for Dubai tomorrow morning for a job. Very urgent, bro Hey, I said not to bring any new people here, right? Why did you bring him? He is not a stranger. He is Guru Murthy's brother-in-law. If Sarkar gets to know, he'll slaughter you Hey Suki, come here I'll go down and get a certificate print Ok Keep an eye on him Ok Drop all your phones here! You also, keep your phone here and step back. I'll ask you three questions I'll let you go, if you answer even one Will you let me go if I answer, Sir? Deal ok Sir! Please ask Who stole certificates from Dot consultancy? Pass!! This question is a pass... Oh no! Who's the reporter who gave the 'fake' news that was telecast on November 27? Ah... This question also I choose to pass Sir! Who killed my son? Is your son dead Sir? Oh.. So sad... RIP! Hey, WHO KILLED MY SON? It's very secure here That means they are hiding something here Hey, pass me a cigarette Who is that? Oh no, so many SERVERS! Is he just selling certificates or running a software company? So many servers means, they may be maintaining a BIG database Let's see what all skeletons will tumble out of this cupboard? Oh my god, so many certificates? They're storing every certificate they sell Why are there so many certificates for the same name? What do you understand by this? 52 certificates said to be fake are proven to be original in our department's verification This certificate of Mr Guru Murthy is indeed original How did the fake certificate turn original? If my guess is correct, they're collecting original certificates from students and selling the fake certificates by matching the names Matching? Don't you understand? What's your full name? Addala Balaji Ok! There are 104 Universities in total in the States of Andhra and Telangana put together. There are about 3400 Colleges under them. About 15 Lakh students are passing out every year from these colleges There definitely will be a guy named Addala Balaji among these 15 Lakh students. Yes buddy, there are a few 'Addala Balajis' on Facebook too. I hate them Yes! If I match his name to your certificate, he will become a lawyer too. Oh yes! See those two certificates, same name, same serial number, but different photos That means they are Cloning the certificates Even if they call the University / College, for background verification, all details will match Such a PERFECT CRIME! Arjun, I have a doubt, What if the names don't match? If the names do not match, it is not possible What's this name, Arjun Lenin Suravaram? It sounds rare No one would have such a name, it won't match He is paying 3 Lakhs, let's try once Ok, give the details But for them to do all this, they need certificate of every student passing out every year How can they get hold of Lakhs of certificates every year? Consultancy? That's closed, right? Not just Dot Consultancy, Balaji, look here They are running numerous consultancies in different names in every district So, that's how they're getting original certificates from students If we bust this, this will be a bigger scam than VYAPAM! He's a lucky person. There is a match for such a rare name too. That too with 81% marks from JNTU Yes, why wouldn't it match? After all we are in this business for the last 17 years. Any name will match Hey, what happened? Name and surname matched! That's fine, but how can the date of birth also match? Is it? Is his photo there? Let's check the original certificate Kavya, we can prove the scam ONLY when we have all this data with us. I'll transfer the data to you Connect to the system in the OB van Damn! Both are the same I swear I know nothing! I got greedy, please forgive me brother I really don't know any details Sir, please leave me I have no more patience. All of you don't choose to die for just one guy We are all media people. If something happens to us, You can't escape You say. Your time is up! Pa, a guy has come for a certificate. But he came to take his original certificate pretending to ask for a fake certificate! What's his name? Arjun Lenin Suravaram Arjun Lenin Suravaram I think, I have heard this name before Check, if his name is there on our education loans list send me his photo immediately Ok Pa Check if the name Arjun Lenin Suravaram is on the channel's staff list His name matched in the previous education loan list. The name matches, Sir He's just a bloody kid! He should not escape from our mansion Ok Pa Hey, all of you come Arjun, they know where you are! They barged into our channel and attacked us Arjun 100% downloaded, you hurry out now No matter what, this evidence must reach the public Kavya, it's dangerous to go to the channel now. Go to Subba Rao uncle And you? I can't come out right now No, I cannot leave you behind like this.. Kavya, just GO Stop it What happened, Kavya? Sudden power outage means something is wrong Go and check Come on, Hello Balaji, where are you? Buddy, I left with the hard disk but Kavya has gone back for you who's that? I know you are here, come out on your own, else you will meet your end. You cannot escape. Switch the power on Sir, Madam has been constantly calling Say something and manage Ok Sir These days, even if a normal person finds any evidence, he's immediately posting that on Social Media And you have a TV channel with you Why wouldn't you put out all the evidence in the open? Why all this drama? I really wish what happened that day was a mere drama Sir Hey, are you fine? I am ok, but where is Subba Rao uncle? He has not come here yet. He still hasn't reached?
