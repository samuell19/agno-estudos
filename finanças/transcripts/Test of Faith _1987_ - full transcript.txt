- [Katie] I'm gonna miss you son. - Be good okay? Bruce, you take care of yourself. - [Bruce] Okay, you too. - And stay outta my room. (Bruce chuckles) - Hey. Oh, remember to write. - [Taylor] I will. - I'm gonna miss you. - [Taylor] I'll miss you too Mom. - Everything's gonna be fine son. - Yes sir. Thank you. Love you guys. - [Katie] We'll miss you. - [Jenny] Bye. (upbeat orchestral music) - [Karl] Dear son, your Mother and I are very proud of you. You've worked hard, and have used your God given abilities to excel in you studies. This has earned you a scholarship to study science at one of the most reputable schools available. Apply yourself diligently. Seek God's help in all you do. Always remember God's grace is sufficient to meet every trial. Love, Dad. P.S. Don't worry about things here on the farm, your brother will help out. Be sure to write when you can. We'll remember you in our prayers. (light guitar music) - He's grown up so fast. - Too fast. - I wish he could go to a university closer to home. - The Lord's will he got that scholarship Katie. Be foolish to turn it down. - I know, you're right, but I'll miss him. Supper will be ready soon. (light guitar music) (upbeat orchestral music) - Uh oh, the new inmate. - I don't room with just anybody. What are ya in for? - [Taylor] Four years I hope. - (chuckles) Serious student, I'm Steve Hershman, sike, just kidding. This is Brett Michaelson, fellow fish. - What's up? - Hi, Taylor, Taylor Mitchell, it's good to meet you guys. - Nice to meet you Taylor. What's your major? - [Taylor] Physics. - Oh, I bet you're good in math, you love it right? - [Taylor] Well, I get by. - Ah come one, straight A student, right, right? - [Taylor] I do okay. - I knew it. I'm telling ya, I'm good at this. I can classify anybody in seconds. I'm good, I really am. - [Taylor] What's your major Steve? - Well it's obvious isn't it? Psychology, I'm gonna be a-- - A shrink, and if you don't help Dr. Van Dork with his math, he'll flunk out the first semester. Hey, I gotta go. It's nice to meet you Taylor. - It's good to meet you Brett. - Country boy eh? - Reminds me of home. - Later. - See ya. So what is this thing? - It's a big John Deere Ford. - [Steve] Hey uh, what's your first class? - Ah, physics. - [Steve] Who's the prof? - [Taylor] It's Dr. Heinlein. - Great, misery loves company. (students chattering) Can you believe the prices on these books? We're being fleeced here Taylor, as in robbed blind. - Education is an investment Steve, didn't you know that? - I bet the manager drives a Rolls. - Look, the math section's over here, let's go. - Hey ah, this isn't a required book is it? - No, that's just some things I like to read. - Okay. - That'll be one thirty-six, twenty-six please. - That should do it. - Hurts huh? - You're not kidding. - Well they say spending money is psychologically healthy for an individual. - Not this individual. - [Cashier] Out of 140. Thank you. - Physics, what a way to start a day. I wonder if there's a way we can reverse the earth's rotation? I mean I could be back in bed. I could write this whole thing off as a bad dream. No no, don't tell me, this is probably your favorite class isn't it? - Look Steve, you have to take physics, you might as well enjoy it. - Good morning class. Welcome to college. If you have not yet obtained your text, course syllabi, and course requirements, please do so today. In this course, it is my job to teach. It is your job to learn. Be assured that I'll pursue my job with utmost energy, and I would suggest that you do the same. Now this class has a reputation for being difficult, but let me assure you that I will fail no one. Some of you undoubtedly however, will manage to fail yourselves. - We've got trouble. - Now please listen attentively while I call the roll. Burrus, Tammy. - Campbell, Lisa. - [Lisa] Here. - Cooper, Cindy. - [Cindy] Here. - Crutcher, Teresa. Thus far we've seen that physics is a science dealing with matter and energy and their interaction with a number of other scientific disciplines, such as mechanics, heat, electricity, radiation and nuclear phenomena. Before you are dismissed, let me say that for those of you who are serious students, anticipating graduate school, or a career in the sciences of some form, this class will be a profitable, and challenging investment of your time. For those of you who are not serious students, this class may well be a door. A door leading to a life away from college. If you want to stay in college, become a serious student. Now for our next class, read the chapter in your text on origins. As you may know, there are several theories dealing with origins, but they boil down basically to two. Natural evolution, or as some would say, creation, a supreme being, God. One calls for mankind to think, the other for mankind to believe. I trust I'm dealing with a group of people here, interested in thinking. Is there anyone here who is not? I am relieved. For this class would be to such a person, most difficult, most difficult indeed, and you can believe that. (bell ringing) Class dismissed. (light orchestral music) - [Taylor] In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. (light orchestral music) - What are you doing? You're not studying? - [Taylor] What? - We're going out, and you're coming with us. - [Taylor] Look guys, I can't. - Early burnout, it's common for people of your personality type, let's go. - Look really, Steve I can't afford this. - Hey, it's on me. - Come on man, there's a great pizza place on campus. - [Brett] Yeah, we ate there the other night. (upbeat music) - [Steve] I got it. - [Brett] So tell me, what do ya think of your new roommate? - I really like him, Steve's a lot of fun. - Yeah, he really is. You know it's incredible he manages to do as much as he does. His family's really messed up. His Dad ran out on him when he was a kid. He and his Mom have had it really tough. It's probably good he got away here at school for awhile. So how'd you wind up here anyway. - [Taylor] I was a default I guess (chuckles). No, I'm here on scholarship. - Yeah? - Yeah, as long as I can maintain a 3.5 GPA, then everything's fine, but if it drops, I'm history. - Ooh, one of those earn or burn programs. - Yeah. - That's pressure. Takes all the fun outta school doesn't it? - Eh, I try not to think about it. - I hope it works out for ya. - Here we go. - Ooh, we're getting our pizza. - Chow time guys. - Boy, that looks great. - This is awesome. Thank you. All right, how is it? - [Steve] Ah, this stuff's magnificent. - [Brett] Mm. - You ready to kill the lights man? - Yeah, I think so. - You read that book a lot don't you? - You mean The Bible? Yeah I do. - Why? - Why what? - [Steve] Why do you read it so much? - Well, there's a lot of reasons really, but I guess mainly because it keeps my head straight. - [Steve] It's not an easy thing to do these days. - [Taylor] I know. - [Steve] Good night man. - [Taylor] Goodnight. - I don't think it's necessary to spend much time on this first chapter. In the regard to development of matter in origins of the universe, it is safe to say that no serious scientist would deny that evolution has not only taken place, but is taking place right now. As a footnote to this, let me add, that the mythological concept of a supreme creative being, God, is primarily an outdated one. This is because of the social, moral nature of the issue. It certainly has no scientific basis. Social, moral issues are in a state of constant change. Continually being developed and adjusted until they are passed into a comfortable obsolescence. Thus it has been with the theory of creation. Yes? - Excuse me sir, but you said that creation was just an outdated theory. Isn't the concept of evolution also just a theory full of discrepancies? - [Dr. Heinlein] Ah, Mister? - Mitchell. - Mr. Mitchell. When the leading scientist worldwide ascribe to a certain viewpoint, they have their reasons. Yes, technically this is just a theory, but in reality it is much more than that, it is the-- - Excuse me sir, you said-- - Mr. Mitchell, I believe you have some deep, underlying motivation for this question? Are you religious? - [Taylor] Well, I (chuckles), I believe that-- - Do you believe in a supreme being, a creator? - Yes I do. - That's exactly the point. You believe in creation, and therefore you resent this course don't you? Of course you do. Mr. Mitchell, I am sorry that you disagree with the authors of our textbook, but these students are here to study science, not theology, not outdated fairytales. They have paid their tuition to study in a very difficult class, and I would suggest sir, that if you are a serious student, you would commit yourself wholeheartedly to this course of study, regardless of your personal preferences. Now we have wasted enough time on this. May we continue? Thank you. (light guitar music) (knocking on door) - [Taylor] Dr. Heinlein? - [Dr. Heinlein] Yes? - [Taylor] May I speak to you for a minute? - Mitchell isn't it? - [Taylor] Yes sir. - What may I do for you? - Well, I'm just concerned that I might've given you the wrong impression this morning. - [Dr. Heinlein] How's that? - Well you said some things that totally disagreed with everything that I've been taught and believed. - Really? - [Taylor] Yes sir. - Welcome to the real world Mr. Mitchell. There's always a shock with the release of childhood fantasies. I remember well the day I discovered there was no Santa Claus. I too was terribly distraught. It took me years to realize that faith and reason are incompatible. Faith is an obstacle, an enemy to clear scientific thinking. I've seen too many bright, promising students, such as yourself, lose their academic futures because of religion. I will not let that happen to one of my students. - Thank you for your time sir. - [Dr. Heinlein] Was there something else? - No sir. Dr. Heinlein I just don't agree with that. - Then prepare yourself young man for a very difficult term. Good day. (light guitar music) - [Leslie] Excuse me, Taylor? I'm sorry to bother you, but could we talk a minute? - Sure. - We haven't met, I'm Leslie Graham. We're in the same physics class with Dr. Heinlein. - [Taylor] Yes (chuckles). - I just wanted to tell you, I admire you. - Me? - For standing up for what you believe. I think it's great. With his reputation being what it is, but you still stand your ground. - Wait a second, his reputation? - You don't know? - No. He picks on anyone who believes in God, The Bible, or anything like that. A lot of students try to avoid his class. I tried, but I need the course. I didn't have a choice. - [Taylor] Neither did I. - How does he get away with it? Can't the university do something about it? - Well, he has the credentials. I guess they think he's an excellent professor. - Taylor, the Lord said we're to love our enemies. Our we to love a man who mocks God, and encourages others to do the same? He's very intimidating. He scares me. I don't know what to do. - Leslie, I only know that God's word is more powerful than any man. He won't be mocked. - You're right. Well, I really enjoyed talking with you, but I need to go now. Maybe we can talk again sometime? - [Taylor] Sure. Goodbye. - Mr. Hershman, Mr. Lovett, Miss Griffin, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Rinkel, Miss Crutcher, Miss Cooper, Miss Tipton. (light orchestral music) - [Taylor] Dear Mom and Dad, I just wanted to write, and let you know what's been going on. No. (light orchestral music) - Let us continue by looking at the term, the expanding universe. This theory is based upon Hubble's law, and Einstein's theory of relativity, which state that the universe began with the big bang. Another blow against the miraculous. It's critical for us to realize that. Mr. Mitchell, did you have a question? - [Taylor] No sir, no sir. - It's important for us to realize that these men faced science intelligently and logically, as they examined the very foundations upon which this world and science. (light guitar music) - You almost quit today didn't you? - What? - Heinlein's class, you almost walked out. Don't let him rattle you man. That's all he's trying to do. Fight back. (knocking on door) - Taylor, telephone. - Thanks. What's the point Steve, and what good is it gonna do? - [Brett] Hey Taylor, how'd you do on that Lit test yesterday? - [Taylor] I think I did pretty well. - Hey, who was on the phone last night? You talked long enough. - That was my Dad. - Yeah, everything okay? - Yeah, he just wanted to know if I could come home for the weekend. - Did you tell him what's been going on? - Not everything. He's got so many things going on this time of the year, he doesn't need anything else to bother him. - Yeah. - Hey, how would you guys like a change of pace? A little fresh air, a little home cooking, horseback riding, fishing. Look, it's perfectly okay with my parents if you guys wanna come for the weekend. - Hey man, say no more, I want outta this place just as bad as you do. - Sounds great to me too, but only if I drive. - [Steve] Hey, when we gonna get there? - [Taylor] It's not gonna be long. Look, we're outta fuel, go down this way, it's a shortcut, it'll save us some time. (whimsical music) - [Brett] Whoa, some shortcut. (whimsical music) - [Taylor] How ya doing? - [Karl] Hey. Good to see ya son. - Good to see you Dad, and Mom. - [Katie] Hello son, how are you? - I missed you so much. Um, this is a good friend of mine, Brett Michaelson. - Brett hi, welcome to our home. - Nice to meet you. - This is my roommate and good friend Steve Hershman. - Steve, welcome to our home son. - This is my Mom and Dad. - Thank you. - Hello Steve, nice to meet you. - Bruce, how ya doing man? Oh, it's good to see you guys. Jenny, give me a hug, oh. This is my sister, this is Jenny, and my brother Bruce. - Hi, how ya doing? - [Steve] Hi Bruce, nice to meet you. - Let's all go in the house, get something cold to drink. - Good idea. - Sounds great. - [Steve] Yeah, I'm thirsty. - [Karl] You have a nice trip? - [Brett] Yeah great. - Yeah great, no problem at all. - [Steve] Oh how delicious. - [Brett] Oh yeah, I agree with you. - [Katie] Everything's ready. - All right. - [Bruce] Looks great. - Boys we're really glad to have you visiting us here. - [Steve] It's good to be here. - [Brett] Thank you. - Let's give God thanks. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your love and your grace. We thank you for bringing our son, Taylor, and his two friends, Brett and Steven, home safely to visit us. We pray you will continue to bless us now, as we fellowship among ourselves with you, and we pray you will bless this food to our bodies, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen. - [Taylor] Amen. (family and guests chattering) - Hey, here you go guys. There's gonna be some high living from here on out. Goodnight. - Well hey, Taylor. - [Taylor] Yeah. - What're we gonna do tomorrow? - Oh, this and that. - What do ya mean this and that? - Well what time are we getting up? - [Taylor] It's gonna be early. - Well how early? - Goodnight guys. - Well hey, wait a minute, (knee thuds) ow. - Man, you all right? - [Brett] Yeah. - [Steve] What'd he turn the lights off for? (whimsical music) - Come on Taylor, you're not really gonna do this are ya? - No, no, you are (chuckles). - Me? - Come on, come on, get down there. - Well what do ya do? - Put your knee right there on him. All right, you got him. Now grab his ear, take a good hold. Now slip it, slip it on, there you go. Now mash it, hard, take a good hold of him, you got him. (cow mooing) - You got him, okay. - [Steve] All right to let him go now? - [Taylor] All right, we're gonna untie him. - [Karl] Okay, let him go. - [Taylor] All right, back up. (whimsical music) - [Taylor] Okay guys, you just grab this rope, and then kick out from this tree, but make sure you don't let go until you're in the middle of the creek. Woo, ha ha ha! Woo, let's go. - [Steve] Go, go on. - [Brett] Woo! - Let's go! - [Steve] All right man, I'll show you guys. - [Taylor] Let's go man. Let's go now. - [Brett] Let's go! - [Taylor] Let's go now! Go, don't scream! - [Steve] Woo hoo, woo, woo! - [Taylor] Come on Brett. Woo! (boys chattering) - [Karl] You boys had a good day? - [Taylor] Yes sir. Yeah, thanks for inviting them Dad. - Well they seem like good boys. - They are, I really like to be around them. - Let's go up to the house. - Dad, could we talk? - Sure. - I don't think I'm gonna make it Dad. I'm losing it. - I wish you'd told me this sooner. I had a feeling there was something wrong. - No matter what I say, Dr. Heinlein shoots me down. No matter what I do, it's never good enough. He hates me. - No, it isn't you. What you stand for maybe. - How could anyone mock God Dad? I mean, he does it all the time, he's proud of it. - The world is made up of all kinds son. There's always been mockers, people hating God. Trying to deny Him of his rightful place in our affairs down here. There's always gonna be some Heinlein fella trying to tear your faith out by the roots. Don't you let him do it son. You're standing on the rock. This professor is in sinking sand. He just doesn't know it. - It would be easier if I thought I was doing any good at all. - You're living your faith. When you're doing that, you're doing more good than you could ever know. - What about my scholarship? What if I lose that Dad? - Well, that's not for you to worry about see. God knows you're on the front lines in this one. He'll see you through it. Okay? - All right. (whimsical music) (boys chattering) (children laughing and screaming playfully) (whimsical music) (knocking on door) - Oh hello Mitchell. - Hi Dr. Heinlein. I just came by to select a topic for my research paper. - Mr. Mitchell, in light of your views, I have taken the liberty of assigning you a topic. Chemical reactions in the origins of life. Now you've had some low grades this quarter, because of your unwillingness to learn, however, if you do the quality of work on this paper, that I think you can do. You will receive a grade that enables you to maintain your scholarship. You do have an alternative. You can receive an F, but I don't think you want that do you? - No sir. (light guitar music) - Taylor, could I talk to you a minute? - [Taylor] Well sure. - I wanted to talk to you at our meeting last week, but you got out before I could catch you. What I wanted to ask you, is if you would be willing to speak to our group this week. - Speak, you want me to speak? Look Glenda, I don't talk well in front of groups. I mean this, I would be about the worse person you could get for something like this. - Oh I don't think so Taylor. I think you have something to say, and some others think you do too. Well, it doesn't have to be long. Some of them are just timid about sharing their faith. If you could encourage them just a little, it sure would mean a lot. - Well, I could be at the-- - Thanks. We meet in Sanders Hall at three o'clock on Tuesday. - Just a second, wait, Sanders Hall. You said it was just gonna be a few people. - Well, we've been growing. Could I have your attention please? Our speaker is here, so we'll begin our meeting. This is Taylor Mitchell. - When Glenda first asked me to come speak today, I have to admit I felt a little inadequate. Actually, I felt a lot inadequate. Um, I, I struggled to think of some things that I could say that, that would be helpful, because I think we all need encouragement sometimes, and so, what little bit that I have to say today, I hope will do that. You see I've learned an important lesson lately. It has to do with defending the Christian faith. A lot of Christians have their faith shaken when they attend a university. Well, here's what I've learned, or in some cases, had reinforced. First of all, our faith is based on solid evidence. Now there's many people who mock and they despise it, but they can't disprove it. You see, this isn't a fairytale. This isn't a myth. This is the truth, and listen, there's plenty of evidence to back it up. Second, I've also learned that we need to be prepared at all times to show unbelievers the credibility of our faith. It's sad to say, but a lot of Christians don't even have a working knowledge of basic doctrine. You see, wherever we are, with whatever abilities that we have, we're to bring honor and glory to the Lord Jesus Christ. 1st Peter, Chapter 3, in verse 15 says, And be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear. You see, this is our responsibility, all of us. It may not be convenient, and it may cost you something, maybe a lot, but when you consider the greatness of our God, and the commitment that He's made for us, it's a small price to pay. - In review, the second law of thermodynamics states that the universe tends toward a state of greater and greater disorder, however, this is based primarily upon observation, and is not there for a totally provable law. Mr. Mitchell. - Sir, in a previous lecture, you said that science is defined as a body of data, arrived at by observable repeatable experimentation. Why is this law considered an improvable statement? I mean, it's the way we've observed the world to function. - There are some exceptions Mr. Mitchell. Class, who can give us some common examples of this law? Mr. Chriswell. - Oh well, it's sort of like when you drop a piece of glass, you get a busted glass, and if you drive a truck into a wall, you get a wrecked truck. Well, there's lot of other stuff that gets messed up as time goes on too. Like, like I even heard that, that if you stop reading and thinking and things, then uh, then your mind starts to dissolve. - Mr. Chriswell, you illustrate your own point quite well. (students chuckles) Another way of illustrating this would be to say that, if we were to drop a jigsaw puzzle to the ground, we would be most surprised to see that it had spontaneously assembled itself. - I'm still having a problem with some of this sir. The text said that an explosion, which is a disorderly release of energy, generated a precisely ordered universe, and in my mind, the dropped puzzle is just a symbol of itself. - Mr. Mitchell, what is your point? - I'm not a qualified scientist, and I'm certainly not the author of this text, but it seems that if-- - [Dr. Heinlein] Quite right, you are sadly unqualified on both counts. - That's exactly my point sir. I mean if, if a novice such as myself could so easily see the contradictions in this line of thinking, well it seems that any-- (bell ringing) - Class is dismissed. Mitchell, I'd like a word with you. Mr. Mitchell, you obviously have your own theory about the beginning of our universe, and I'd like to hear it. - Well, we've always been told to ask questions, and I think I've been misunderstood here, but yes sir, I do, I have my own views on how things began. It's found in The Bible. Earlier this year, you said that to believe in God, creation, that it was a blind leap of faith. Well, I don't believe in blind faith sir. I think it's wrong to have blind faith in anything. - Absolutely correct. - Well then it's no different when it comes to God, or well the claims that Jesus made in the New Testament sir. Dr. Heinlein, I can't prove to you that God created the universe, but there are so many evidences that He did create, and that He does exist. Things did not create themselves. - Your point? - Whatever is made, is made by someone. A plan is drawn, methods, standards are, are developed, and then a manufactured item is produced. Look at the planning that goes into just a car, a house. Even the most simple manmade devices had a creator. The creator is usually reflected in the creation. Colossians 1:16 says, And by Him were all things created that are in heaven and earth, visible and invisible. - Mr. Mitchell, you are quoting from a source that in and of itself is highly subjective. You may quote from this source all day if you wish. It only serves to further invalidate your position. - How does it invalidate my position sir? - For your information young man, the original manuscripts of these so-called gospels which you say prove the existence of Jesus, do not even exist. You are basing your belief upon an unverified shadow of history, a phantom. - Dr. Heinlein, are the works of the Roman historian Tacitus reliable? What about the Greek historian Thucydides, or Caesar's Gallic Wars, Aristotle? Fourteen hundred years lie between the actual writings, and the oldest known copies of Aristotle's poetics. The original manuscripts don't exist, and the same could be said for Thucydides and Tacitus. Are these men, these events, are they only unverified shadows in history too sir? Over 4,000 Greek manuscripts of the New Testament exists sir, 4,000. Some as near as a hundred and fifty to a hundred and twenty years after the death of Christ. Jesus walked this earth Dr. Heinlein, he was here. There were eyewitnesses of His life, His death, and His resurrection. Science doesn't deny these facts. Why are you? (light orchestral music) Hey, what're you working on? - Trying to get my head straight man. - Steve, you're reading my Bible. - Well I got to wondering if some of what you got might start rubbing off on me. - [Taylor] What? - Well you're different man. Most religious people I know are always sticking their fingers in my face, telling me how much better they are than me. I don't need that. I have enough problems without solutions, but you've never once judged me, or talked down to me. You've almost got me believing there's something to this. - Steve, there's a lot to this. This world has a sin problem, and it's because of this sin that we've been separated from God. Now there's only one way to solve this problem. Jesus came down to this earth, and He died for guys like you and me. We have to recognize that we're all sinners, and we have to turn from this sin, and by faith, we have to except Jesus Christ as both our Lord and our Savior. - [Leslie] Taylor. - [Taylor] Hey. - [Leslie] Haven't had a chance to talk to you in awhile, how've you been? - [Taylor] I'm doing okay. - Good, how's the paper coming? - That was a real challenge, but it's done. - Really? It's not due until Monday is it? - I just wanted to get it finished a little early. - You will be back next term won't you? - Well, I don't know. That all depends on my scholarship, and this paper. - When will you know if you can't come back? - It should be a couple of weeks after the term's over, you know, when we get our grades back. If their high enough, well. - Taylor, you know what I wish you would do someday? - What's that? - Write a paper on what you really believe, and give that to Dr. Heinlein. - That's exactly what I've done with this paper. You see Leslie, the whole point that I've been trying to make is that science, and I'm talking about real science, it doesn't exclude the existence, or the creative activity of God. You see, none of my conclusions have gone against the laws of the physics or chemistry that we know about. An objective study of the scientific facts, that supports, it doesn't contradict Bible truths. I just hope that Dr. Heinlein recognizes, I'm not chasing after religious fairytales. - [Leslie] Taylor I wanna thank you. - For what? - For staying true to yourself and to the Lord. I really wish there were more people like you. - Leslie, do you think that we could write? Like, I mean if I don't come back next semester? - You'll be back. (whimsical music) - [Taylor] Dr. Heinlein? - [Dr. Heinlein] Yes. - [Taylor] Hi. - Are we having some trouble? - No sir, I just wanted to come by, and drop off my research paper. - It's not due until Monday. - Well I know, but I'm gonna be going home a little earlier than I had planned. I just wanted to make sure you got it all right. - Did you have trouble with this? - Yes sir, I did. - Are you sure you want to submit this? - Yes sir. I believe this accurately reflects the origins of life. - Very well. - Well, goodbye Dr. Heinlein. - Goodbye Mr. Mitchell. (light orchestral music) (light guitar music) - [Karl] Okay. You got it? - [Taylor] Yes sir. - [Karl] Okay. Well are you gonna hold this for me or what? - [Taylor] Yes sir. - Let's get this one. Okay, you stuff it in right there, okay. Well, you gonna check the mail? Well, so what if you checked it everyday for two weeks. Maybe this will be the day. - I'll get it. - [Karl] (grunts) All Right. - Taylor, it came, it came, Mom it came. - Why don't you open it Dad? - Taylor, you better look at this. - Woo, yes! (Karl laughs) Unbelievable, look. - [Katie] Congratulations son. (upbeat orchestral music)
