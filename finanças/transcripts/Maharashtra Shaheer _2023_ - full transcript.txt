'You're watching a live telecast of the second day...' [Male] 'It's the second day of the world peace conference...' 'Artists from all over the world...' 'are participating in this grand parade...' 'It seems like people from different parts of the world...' 'and cultures are here to represent their countries' 'Even the locals are' 'in a joyous celebratory mood...' [Music] [Duff beating] "Maharashtra... a land so versatile..." "A wondrous place..." "graced by great men..." "Saints were born here..."

I'm a bit late... means... Namaste sir... You are right on time... He is Mr. Bobby... he will take the interview and I'm Mayur Hardas... I am the interpreter [Sighs] That's a relief Else in the interview... they wouldn't get a word of what I'm saying... and I won't get what he's saying anyway... [Laughs] The yesterday's song was magnificent. We didn't understand words but it is still in our heads. It was exhilarating. He says, the song... is still stuck in his head He couldn't understand the words but it was inspiring. That was about our esteemed king. About a king? An esteemed, wise king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj That song is about a king A king? The paper says you're a socialist and still you sung about king. He says you're a socialist... so you should talk about equality. Why sing about a king? Just as I sing about... Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, I have a ballad about... Karl Marx, and the French Revolution. The song isn't just about his being a royal. It's about his ideas his values his teachings, his notion of independence... it's not only for Maharashtra but the entire nation's absorbed it. And yet... there are a few ignorant souls. Now... and back then... It takes some effort to open their eyes [Music] "Young Shivaji, Jijau's son..." "was growing up..." "All he thought about was..." "his Maharashtra..." "Like the mighty sun" "at the height of its power..." "It scorched..." "the throne of Delhi..." "He led the kids of Maval to victory..." "He led the kids of Maval to victory..." "Like lord Ram did with his army of monkeys" Shahir... Shahir, he's Mr. Aiyar... He's the chief of All India Radio. Namaste Listen, Mr. Sable, you can't sing like this. You tell him. This is All India radio, not All Bombay radio. The word Maharashtra cannot come so many times. Shahir... he says the word Maharashtra... I know a bit of English... Now ask him... if knows Marathi after spending time here... And if I avoid the word... where do I say Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born? Delhi or Kolkata? Listen we are answerable to our headquarters in Delhi. That's the throne that was struck by Chhatrapati... Delhi is scared of Maharashtra from that day on Mr. Sable! Sir... Sir... Shahir... let's not argue... You have a contract. He can ban you. Krushna, calm down. Let's see if there's some solution. Yes sir. Look here... in five minutes we are going live... don't say Maharashtra. Sir... He won't say it for the live telecast... Krushna... "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." [Krushna] 'Maharashtra was not the only thing banned in those days...' 'I was banned as well.' 'But I was used to such things since I was a kid...' 'I had a happy childhood...' 'Roaming with friends, swimming in the river...' 'playing the flute, singing...' 'I was surrounded by the music...' 'but never in front of my mother...' I'll break your leg if you sing another word... It's Nani, run... Yes... but where... You're singing again. I keep saying... singing won't put food on the table... Will you even listen... Just go to school... study... Your father has worked so hard for us... but he's under debt. Don't you feel like helping? What're you looking at? Take this... and go home. Don't leave the the story halfway Kisnya... What happens next? What did all those milkmaids say to mother Yashoda? They said... Not like this, tell us in a song. In a song? Are you crazy? If Nani finds out... she will send me to Amalner with uncle... Don't worry, we'll keep a watch... sing now... Come on... No, no. [Music] "All the milkmaids are going to the banks of Yamuna" "and ask Yashoda what to do with Kanha..." "He breaks the pots" "Raids the milk and curd" "Yashoda take care of him" "he is creating havoc for us" "Teases with lots of sweet talk" "Runs away in a flash" "Dark son of yours..."

Nabe, what happened to him? He just won't stop crying. Hari... Please sing a lullaby. No way! He calms down every time he hears you sing. You're a fool. Nani will blow her top if she hears my voice... She isn't here. [Baby crying] And she'll get angry if he keeps crying. Please Sing. I will be on the lookout. Go then... Hari... quite now... [Humming] Nani's coming... Nabu... was he singing? Tell me... Did you sing after coming home? Nani... Why don't you even ask Hari... if I was singing? [Nabu laughs] [Singing a folk song] Nani you scold me if I sing and here you are, doing the same thing. It helps pass the time if you're busy working, but that's not how you do it. Singing is all you do. My child, singing is not wrong but it's not enough for survival. Even Baba sings. The whole village comes to listen to his Bhajans. I want to be like him Nani. Will they listen to my singing as closely? Will they wait for me? Of course... But pay attention to the school first. Learn and be someone. Look at your uncle Keshav. He's younger than your father. But he went to Bombay and... Nani, Where's father? Where else? At the temple. He has a Kirtan to perform. Oh yes! Kisan wait... Eat something... No, I will eat something at the temple. What a child! [Music] "Shri Hari plays with colours in Gokul..." "Shri Hari plays with colours in Gokul..." [Music] "Shri Hari plays with colours in Gokul..."

"Don't go Kisna, don't go Kisna" "Don't go, don't go now" "Don't go Kisna... don't go now..." I'm sure Nani was in the crowd that day. I didn't see her... but one feels such things. She loved me so much and had high hopes from me... So many dreams... that's why she sent me to my grandmother's house. [Krushna] 'At Amalner.' Come... We have a tradition here, people tie strings or pieces of fabric around this tree hoping their wish to come true... Would you like to try? Yes. Give. Come now... Mother will be waiting. She will love you so much... you won't miss Pasarni village. Come in... Mother... come quick... look who's here. Go now... Keep your bag there... Go wash up first. Then come to me. Go... "Let's build a rebellion" "let's awaken those who sleep" "Let's build a rebellion" "let's awaken those who sleep" "Fight till our last breath for the farmer's rights..." "Let's awaken those who sleep" "Let's build a rebellion, let's awaken those who sleep..." Kisna just forget about this song and dance now. And study hard. That's why you are here. Long live mother India! Vande Mataram... I bow to thee, Motherland. Son in law's son, is a whole lot of trouble. Long live mother India! Vande Mataram... I bow to thee, Motherland. Long live mother India! Vande Mataram... I bow to thee, Motherland. Long live mother India! Vande Mataram... I bow to thee, Motherland. "Where did lord Krishna disappear..." "Where did lord Krishna disappear..." "Why hasn't he turned up yet..." "Why hasn't he turned up yet..." "Where did lord Krishna disappear..." "Where did lord Krishna disappear..." You have a nice voice... Guruji... Sit, all of you... What's your name? Krushna Ganpat Sable... And yours? Pandurang Sadashiv Sane. Why do they call you Guruji? [Laughs] Will you sing in our meeting? Sure I will... But which meeting? Today, we have Sane Guruji's meeting. It will begin with a song... sung by master Krushna Ganpat Sable... from our village. Afterwards, Guruji will enlighten us about the importance of education and values The Meeting will begin shortly... Guruji... Should we start? Should we wait for a bit? I don't see Krushna anywhere. Friends, we will begin the meeting in a short while with Krushna Sable's song... Aaji... Give it. Aaji... my song... I told you so many times... but you don't get it... Aaji... song... song... song. Your songs are getting on my nerves... Aaji... Aaji... You... Mai... Guruji... Why is Krushna still here? Meeting is to begin with his song. Okay... So your grandmother sent you for the meeting... on Sane Guruji's insistence... [Chuckles] [Sobbing] My grandmother tied me to a pole that night but how could she tie up a song? I kept on singing discreetly. But I took one precaution. I was often caught by my mother... but I wasn't going to, by my grandmother... [Laughs] I was growing up... I managed to reach seventh standard. Amalner gave me many things. I was in the company of great personalities. There was Sane Guruji... but I even met Hirabai Badodekar there. I was also blessed by a great man... Saint of Maharashtra... Saint Gadge Maharaj... "The man who comforts the oppressed..." "and the downtrodden..." "The man who comforts the oppressed..." "and the downtrodden..." "He is a true saint..." "a true mark of the holy..." "He is a true saint..." "a true mark of the holy..." "The man who comforts the oppressed and the downtrodden..." "Devaki Nandan Gopala... Gopala... Gopala..." "Devaki Nandan Gopala... Gopala... Gopala..." "Devaki Nandan Gopala... Gopala... Gopala..." "Devaki Nandan Gopala... Gopala... Gopala..." Aaji. Mother... Give me your grandson. Oh mother... Gadge baba himself is asking for your grandson... He is truly lucky... You must have done a good turn in your previous life... It's the villages good fortune... to have you and Kisna in our midst... Ask me anything and I will happily surrender it. Even if you ask for my house, I will gladly hand it over... I will roam from village to village with you... But what can I do... Son in law's son is someone else's wealth... how can I give it up? What will my daughter and son in law say? It will be a debt that will never be forgiven... And I wouldn't be able to face the world like that... Please forgive me... [Screams] [Krushna] 'Aaji had to refuse Gadgebaba in front of the entire village, ' 'it angered her so much' 'that she decided not to spend on my education.' 'She had already forbidden my singing.' 'What else could hold me back in Amalner?' 'So, I realised, it was time to go...' Kisan? Didn't you have a few more days of school? [Krushna] 'That day, my mother stopped talking to me.' She was hurt and my singing was the cause of it. So, I decided to stay away from singing. Nothing happened for a while... but I was growing up at the speed of a galloping horse... [Horse neighing] [Panting] Kisna, you are too much. You managed to get hold of Shankar's horse. Bhau... Nani is calling you home. Kisna, good that you're here. See who's come to visit? Its Keshav kaka... Don't just stand there, greet him. [Krushna] 'In the hope of getting my life on track...' 'my mother asked another relative for help...' 'I agreed because I saw the dreams in her eyes...' 'But this time, my destination was Mumbai...' "Mumbai city is tough" "but also a lavish paradise..." "The world sings its praise" "The world sings its praise and life is full of riches," "such are the wonders of Mumbai..." "City's always young" "with a trade across the sea..." "Ships dock all day round..." "such are the wonders of Mumbai..." [Music] [Krushna] 'Who was I?' 'Why was I here?' 'What was my aim in life?' 'I had forgotten everything to mold myself as a millworker.' 'My song beckoned but I tried my best to ignore it.' 'And that would have been my life...' 'if my Guruji hadn't come back to guide me.' Sane Guruji is coming for a visit at Sorabjee Mill. Glory to mother India... Glory to mother India... Guruji... Guruji... Namaste Guruji... Glory to mother India... Guruji... Guruji... I'm Krushna... From Amalner... Krushna Sable... Guruji... I left my singing behind... Permanently. How are you are still alive Krushna? If someone asks me to let go of my social work... love for my country... then I won't be able to stay alive. Singing is like breathing for you... Krushna, your soul needs it... Breath Krushna, take a long breath... "Gandhi is my friend, I will sing a hymn for him..." "I will go to prison, just to get my freedom..." "Kastur is my mother and I will pay her my respects..." "Subhash is my brother and I will bow to him..." You have a voice that captivates those around. We need a voice like you. You should join the struggle for independence. Guruji? I... but I can only sing... Realise the power of your voice Krushna... You don't just sing... you are a balladeer... a Shahir. Shahir? "Queen of Zashi was such a heroic queen..." [Music] "Queen of Zashi was such a heroic queen..." She taught the British a lesson in the year 1935... He is Shahir Siddharam Basappa Muchate. This is what a Shahir is... He inspires and sparks the emotions... Guruji, I want to be like him. Kisan... You're here! Why didn't you write first? Give it here, now come in. Nani, I won't go back to Mumbai. What? Keshav kaka arranged such a good job for you, and money- Nani... I'm going to sing. Huh? Yes. Kisan, I told you. Even if you break my leg, I will sing... I will sing... I will sing [Camera clicks] [Music] "Get up Sahib, gather your stuff and return to your country" "Get up Sahib, gather your stuff and return to your country" "And return to your country" "We heard your nonsense for many years" "it's time to take your ship out of the harbor..." "Get up Sahib, gather your stuff and return to your country" "Get up Sahib, gather your stuff and return to your country" [Clapping] I am Bhanumati Barsode. Even I'm a student of this school. That performance kids had before yours she's the one who hosted it. Even I write poetry. Have a look. Can I send you my poems? Sure you can. Address? I mean... Where to send the poems? Should I hold that? No... I love my duff so much... That letter you sent me... I thought it would be something important... but meeting like this, in a lonely place... You don't care for my love... Let's get married, have kids... you and me... No, never... My aim is clear... Bring a rebellion that will break the chains of slavery... our motherland is bound by... No no no, please take me with you... It's just 'Please take me', pay attention to your lines... Kisna... a letter... a letter... I met the postmaster on the way... a letter... It can wait. Carry on... Just see the letter... Bhanumati Barsode... Phaltan... It's just a poem... It's good... The girl is intelligent... Or so it seems... But that life's not for me... One should forget about such things... [Music] "My cheeks are blossomed," "with a tender newfound love," "The fresh new springtime blooms..." "My soul beckons you" "Even when you are not nearby" "Only you can find a way out..." [Music] "You are an exquisite beauty," "With laser sharp eyes" "Tell me how to extinguish..." "Tell me how to extinguish" "This ever-spreading blaze..." "My cheeks are blossomed," "with a tender newfound love," "The fresh new springtime blooms..." Bhanumati's telegram... She's run away from home... Kisna, what now? Have you decided? Or we should just go home? Bhanumati, its not right... I have decided... My verse and your voice... It's all we need I don't think it will work Bhanumati... Just let it go. Just let it go. I don't long for abode of kings, Or lavish palatial homes of the rich, I will be happy with a poor simple man... [Music] "Abundant summers bloomed in my mind" "and wafted around" "became one with your sweet music," "I remained in a daze..." "Anklets respond to hushed heartbeats," "Love grows when the eyes meet" "The beckoning of your heart" "Is a call for growing passion" "Yearning of the soul..." "Yearning of the soul" "Waiting for a sign from you..." "I feel the music all around," "And shyness overpowers," "It's the onset of something new..." [Music] So you eloped with a girl in 1942? She came on her own... to Pasarni. Hail Lord Bhairoba... Hail Lord Bhairoba... [Krushna] 'Pasarni had a fair the next day.' 'The entire village was in the spirit of it.' 'Every house had guests...' 'Even Bhanumati stayed as a guest at Vasant Sonar's home.' Brother, What's that? Nothing. I'll just show our guest around. Wow, you got her a new saree... Just get lost. Hail Lord Bhairoba... [Krushna] 'Along with the traditional attractions of the fair' 'villagers had kept my performance as well.' Shahir, how long do we wait? It's late already. Just wait for a bit. We have something different planned. [Krushna] 'No one knew what was about to take place.' 'Neither villagers, nor my family.' Come on Nabe, enough with the fancy dress. When are you getting ready? Aren't you coming for the program? You go on ahead. I'll come later to visit the temple. [Clapping] Hail Lord Bhairoba... Hail Lord Bhairoba... Hail Lord Bhairoba... Hail Lord Bhairoba... [Krushna] 'As the time passed, I got restless...' 'and then I saw her...' Come this way... 'Bhanumati...' Laxmi, why are you still here? See what Krishna is up to... Hail Lord Bhairoba... Ganpat Rao, what are you doing here? Come with me. Kisanrao has abducted a girl... a Brahmin girl! Hail Lord Bhairoba... Is this a way to get your bride home? Without consulting, or even informing us... No-one listens to me in this house... My husband sings Bhajans day and night and now the son is creating a mess of his own... What will the villagers say! Nani, it's a happy occasion. Your son got married with lord Bhairavnath as his witness on this very auspicious day... [Thuds] Just shut up. If you are so happy, take them to your own home... What will the villagers say? Keshav kaka got him a nice job in Mumbai but he ran off to become a Shahir and how will that be enough for survival? Everyone is piss poor here... Come now, will you say something? Daughter in law... This is our copy of Dnyaneshwari (Sacred writing). From this day on, it belongs to you. This is the only gift I have for you. Have it Hail Lord Pandurang! [Objects clatter] Just give them your musical instruments and even they will join in. I don't think things will work out here. Get a new home. It will be for the best... Bless you... How long do we have to wait? Shankrya, Vasanta, are you done? Can we come? Yes, come now. He's used to it. In our troupe's play, he always plays the role of Kisna's wife. Almost like a mistress... [Laughs] Come in Vahini. Come in. Like this? Yes. One... two... and... best... Now keep your hand on this... and turn your face like... Hello...! Just a minute... Are we going to hear the new radio or you will keep on taking its pictures? You think I am photographing the radio, yeah? Not 'yeah'...say 'Yes'. Yes? Not 'Yes'...say 'Yeah'... Yeah? Nope Not 'nope'...say 'No'... [Laughs] [Music playing on radio] Hey, just hold it there... Like this? Let's take a photo. What, again... Just... No, please... You with duff. No... [Laughs] [Laughs] Come on... Come... No... [Radio news] 'There's an important update...' 'about Sane Guruji's hunger strike.' 'Sane Guruji has announced a fast-unto-death' 'over Pandharpur temple's discrimination, against Harijan community' 'It's the fifth day of the hunger strike.' 'Many of his followers are in Pandharpur to meet him.' 'The government is taking the matter seriously' Sane Guruji's on a hunger strike. I should have done it instead Are you crazy? Its significant, because he's doing it. Bhauji... We should do something to support the cause. Bhauji, have this. What do we have the 'Janata Kala Pathak' for? We'll campaign and convince all to allow Harijan's in the temple. Words should follow the action. Meaning? Meaning you should definitely campaign... but set an example first. Action first, then say it. Done. We'll begin with Harijan entry In Pasrani's Bhairavnath temple... we'll begin with Harijan entry demonstration. Hail lord Bhairoba... I'm happy to be here today. I am glad that Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil... Krantisinh Nana Patil and Sane Guruji are also here. The other temple will follow suit but before that happens Krushna, Shahir Krushnarao Sable from your village has been instrumental along with the villagers, in giving the Harijan's right to enter the temple. Krushna Is this the boy who will cross the threshold of the temple. Yes Guruji. Very good. Come on. Guruji, I have a request. Bhanumati has written something... For this occasion, and for you. She would like to read it here... Can she? Come on Bhanumati... Blessed is River Chandrabhaga... Pandurang gratified... Wow! Pandurang is gratified. Guruji, you are Pandurang. Pandurang Sadashiv Sane. 'Blessed is River Chandrabhaga...' 'Pandurang gratified.' 'Pandurang gratified.' 'Pandurang gratified.' 'Pandurang gratified.' Even before Harijan communities were allowed to enter the Pandharpur temple it was allowed in Pasarni, because the village stood by me. But there were a few who did not like this. We had no time to worry about them because the country was still under British rule and we could not sit quietly. The whole purpose of a Shahir is... to spark an awareness in the society. And I had Bhanumati I could rely upon. It was her verse... and my voice. What's up? Have a look. Oh mother, let the shackles on our feet crumble... Shackles of the British rule, Shackles of the British rule, let these shackles crumble Let the spark of revolution rise in our midst... Great but if we use such direct language they will put us in jail But shouldn't we speak out our thoughts Why don't we use the form of folk art? So we can say what we want... but... No one should know... Exactly! Bhanumati... Since you've thought of mother goddess in the first line. I think we should ask her to bless the Gondhal... [Strumming] It's done. That was quick. Let me see... Sing it...

Aren't you pregnant? Please have it. [Groans] Careful... Cravings seem strong. My sister had a similar case... Brother, who's the letter for? Krushnarao Sable? Her husband... Your mother's letter. We go through this trouble... go to godforsaken places... to teach the importance of education... yet no one care. Cares'...not 'care'. That's what I said. You don't need to anymore. Meaning what?

I will get the ST tickets and drop a message to Shankrya. Not 'drop', send a message. Yes, send a message. Who's this? He's a millworker. A very fine artist. Is that right? What's your name. Raja Mayekar. 'Raja' Mayekar? Raja of name only. Otherwise just a peasant. [Laughs] See, He's cracking jokes already. "Sun has risen, its shining across the mountain," "I salute the dawn of a new day..." "I salute the dawn of a new day..." "I salute the dawn of a new day..." "Errrrrr..." "Sir, sir, what's the matter..." "I'm stung by a scorpion..." "What shall I do, about this Scorpion sting," "Whom should I ask, about this Scorpion sting," "Errrrrr..." "About this Scorpion sting," "I'm Stung by, stung by, stung by... a Scorpion." "Sir, sir, will you please elaborate?" "I'm strung by the scorpion of anger and desire," "Dark beads of sweat cover my whole being," "I find myself in throes of death," "Sir, is that really killing you..." "Errrrrr, I'm stung by a scorpion..." "Errrrrr... sir..." "Err... Scorpion stung" "Sir..." "Errrrr..." "Errrr... Sir..." "Errrrrr..." "About this Scorpion sting," "What shall I do" "about this Scorpion sting," "Whom should I ask, about this Scorpion sting," "Err... Scorpion stung" [Baby crying] Laxmi... it's a daughter. "We sing praises of lord Vitthal" "with lord's name on our lips..." "We sing praises of lord Vitthal" "with lord's name on our lips..." "We sing praises of lord Vitthal" "with lord's name on our lips..." "We sing praises of lord Vitthal with lord's name on our lips..." Kisan... Nani... Your father has left us... "Saints and disciples have gathered to sing his praises..." "Saints and disciples have gathered to sing his praises..." "We sing praises of lord Vitthal" "with lord's name on our lips..." "Facing anger with grasp on absolution," "Arming self with knowledge against indulgence..." "Keshavdas says with saints and disciples..." "Sings his praises..." "We sing praises of lord Vitthal" "with lord's name on our lips..." "We sing praises of lord Vitthal" "with lord's name on our lips..." Nani, Shahir is taking part in cinema now. He will sing and he'll be on screen as well. Shankrya... ask Kisna to look after the domestic drama as well... He disappears once he steps out the door... I'm looking after his wife and kids... "I don't need a husband" "I don't need a spouse..." "She don't need a husband" "She don't need a spouse..." "I don't need a husband" "I don't need a spouse..." "She don't need a husband" "She don't need a spouse" "I don't need a husband" "I don't need a spouse..." "She don't need a husband" "She don't need a spouse" "A broken house..." "and a splintered roof..." "Why is it so?" "A broken house..." "and a splintered roof..." "So, stay in it" "But there isn't a place in the house" "I don't need a spouse..." "She don't need a husband" "She don't need a spouse" "She don't need a husband" "She don't need a spouse" "She don't need a husband" "She don't need a spouse" [Music] "I will be a star..." "high above in the sky" "I will be a star..." "high above in the sky" "How will you come there?" "how will we meet?" "how will we meet?" [Music] "If you be a star" "I will be a small bird" "I'll go past the moon" "and come straight to you..." [Music] "I will be a fish" "and reside on the ocean bed..." "How will you come there" "how will we meet..." "how will we meet..." "how will we meet..." Had a dream of a journey together A mingling of a verse and a voice Voice has moved ahead leaving the verse all alone... It's suffocating need a moment of respite... [Music] "Music is in the air..." "And dancers front the procession..." "Groom is at edge of the town..." "How will you take the bride home?" "I'll show my respect to border guard," "And win my bride away..." "I'll show my respect to border guard," "And win my bride away..." And so we resumed our married life in Mumbai. Mumbai was facing problems of its own. Samyukta Maharashtra movement. To stop the attempts of breaking Mumbai's ties with Maharashtra great balladeers sprung to action. Shahir Anna Sathe, Shahir Amar Shaikh were leading it even I was a modest participant. [Krushna] 'But what about Bhanumati?' 'With the kids to look after' 'the poetess in her had taken a backseat.' 'So, I took her along...' Take this. 'And started things anew.' No one will hold you back. Write... [Chuckles] Come on, write one... Bhanumati ...take this... But... wait... I will take Vasu, but you get on with the writing. Come on... Write... About what? Write a ballad on Chhatrapati. It's for All India Radio. About Maharaj? Yes. That can be written effortlessly. "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "Maharashtra, a land so versatile..." "A wondrous place" "graced by great men..." "Saints were born here..." "scholars and artists as well," "displaying new craft each passing day..." Khale sir, I was banned from All India Radio just for saying the word 'Maharashtra' and you want me to sing the Maharashtra anthem? Shahir, things have changed. Samyukta Maharashtra movement has been won. Khale sir, have some tea. That's enough... The date when Yashwantrao will arrive... with the Mangal Kalash of Maharashtra, is finalized. May 1st... The day should be celebrated It will be the 'Maharashtra Day' henceforth. Not for me... put on my tab. Yes. And the anthem should grace the radio on that day. What do you say Rajabhau? Of course. Shahir, I have written a couple of songs and they should be recorded in your voice. Rajabhau I believe Maharashtra Anthem should be recorded in the voice of Shahir Amar Shaikh He's played a major role in Samyukta Maharashtra movement. I agree with you, but... Khale sir. I don't think the politicians would ever let their petty politics go. But I'm tied up with my work. When will I record, when will I rehearse... No no, We can do the rehearsals here so you won't need to go anywhere and the time will be saved. What do you say Rajabhau? Yes, but only you should sing that song. Yes... get those songs. Yes, just a minute... Here. Victory to my Maharashtra, proclaim it's my Maharashtra... Narayan, Narayan Naradmuni, what's the rush? I almost fell down a crevice trying to keep up with you. Crevice? Ah, you mean a pothole! [Laughs] You will see such potholes everywhere... But my fall could have shattered the earth from its axis... Nothing would have happened. Humans have built a world of their own. What? Only thing it lacks is the careful cosmic balance you had created, and welfare of all species. I am so concerned to hear this. Tell me Naradmuni... Yes, Brahmadeva... Why is that space empty? Didn't they think of erecting some 'colony' there? They will, eventually. The builder lobby will fight... for every last inch of the land... [Clapping] It's good response. It's called a 'Maidaan'... Maidaan? What does it mean? Maidaan... Its where no 'aid' is encouraged... [Laughs] Why is the place so crowded? Maybe someone's sitting there... on a hunger strike. Or a meeting of some leader... Leader? I created humans but who created leaders? What is a leader? Leader is someone who leads people on a road of no return. [Clapping] [Laughs] Wow Shahir! What a performance! One of the best we had! Shahir, you made us laugh so much, my stomach still hurts. [Laughs] Imagine, our committee wanted to get someone else... I said nothing doing. We want only Shahir. Yes, That's right. And songs... they were so good. Songs were written by my wife, Bhanumati. Bhanumati, come and say hello... In a moment... But, the way you sung... that's what made it so enjoyable... I agree, it's your voice that counted Writing was okay. And those songs about politicians the humour... that was perfect. Shahir, come on, we are felicitating you... Come on, come on. Yes... I will give... calm down. That day on, Bhanumati started drifting apart. As a wife and as an artist. No Charu, you won't get the car. I'm playing. Please Shahir, what's there to think about? Just say yes. Baba... Kids, please... just take care of her... Baba is here, don't worry... Chief Minister of Maharashtra himself... Mr. Yash- Baba... What's the matter my child? Something's the matter with chief minister... and you are crying over a toy... Go, play with them now... When Yashwantrao Saheb has called, it must be important... But I guess he's contemplating whether to go... There's no question of not going - Baba... Will someone take care of her... my child, please... Mayekar just wait, I'll take care of it... Charu, please calm down... Bhanumati ...listen Bhanumati... please look after the kids, we are working... Even I am working although you may think it's unimportant... Listen, Yashwantrao has called... he wants to meet for some important work... And why wouldn't he... He always tells me you are from the same village as Venu tai you'll have to be treated most cordially... He's called me as an artist. Not because of some village... Aren't you forgetting something? You are in this position because of the power of my writing... Welcome... Samyukta Maharashtra state was established with your help... I'm fully aware of the power of your writing, your voice... I know what it's capable of. In the coming elections... The party is hoping for your participation Especially we need the support of Shahir he has his finger on the pulse of the people. Sir, the work being done by the government the new schemes and their benefits can be conveyed easily enough. It's the job of a Shahir. But we won't stand for any one party or candidate. Our art shouldn't be used for the same. Mr. Sable, the candidate who stands for the election the one you'll support, won't he get a seat in the assembly? Do you consider the party different than the government? Exactly. Honorable sir, Sable is giving his personal opinion. If someone doesn't want to participate in the election campaign why bother about his views? What's the point of pushing someone who has no faith? We are artists. We answer to no one. Those who have joined the Congress recently... should take a careful look at their past. Where we used to be, who we used to support under whose directions we thrived and whose praises we are singing now... They claim to represent... the poets and writers of Maharashtra, but I've already alerted the real artists through my song... "My fellow artists..." "Put your country first," "Our art is precious," "But demand only what's deserved," "Don't let it fail," "Honor the written verse," "Put your country first," "Art of Shahir Sable," "Is devoted to mother India," "Strength to my voice," "Is the only thing I ask," "Put your country first," "My fellow artists..." "Put your country first." Sir, should I stop him? No. He's a lion of Sahyadri we can't cage him. Shahir... Ah, Mayekar is here for the Shikran give a couple of more bananas... Don't bother with the fruits... I am concerned about the word on the streets... What's that? That Sable shouldn't have said what he did. Rajabhau, don't worry. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen? He is a very smart politician... Who is? Chavan Saheb? Shhh... Shahir, Shahir... Even if Chavan Saheb looks in a certain way at someone in a meeting, or during a speech... that's it. Either the man is lucky, else... Rajabhau, we must be true to our work. Without worrying about consequences. Or we won't be able to do anything. Sometimes I feel lord Krishna wrote Bhagwat Geeta with artists in mind. He is Shahir Sable. This is from Chief Minister. Will you have some water? No... Namaste... Namaste. Shahir, open it quickly... Has he put a ban on us? Quick now... We're banned... Shahir Sable and Party is banned... I will return to Konkan... Not Konkan... We are asked to go to Western Maharashtra. What? We will promote the welfare schemes, but won't do the party propaganda. Maharashtra is lucky... to have such an enlightened chief minister. Today at 7 pm, at Wai ground the election campaign for our assembly candidate Dadasaheb Jagtap, is scheduled to begin. On this occasion... we have a performance of Shahir Krushnarao Sable. Brothers and sisters... put your faith in Congress party symbol. Shahir... the crowd is only here because of you. Shahir, where are you off to? Come on stage. Meeting has begun... No, I'll take your leave... But we haven't felicitated you yet... Felicitate the candidate, you may not see him over the next five years... [Laughs] What a punch! I'm using it in the next play! Sure... Kisna... Shankar... Look who's here to meet you... Nani! It's okay... How are you... Shahir! Nothing doing. Not Shahir... I'm still the same old Kisna... You are a big man... You are blessed by the goddess Saraswati... I was wrong in keeping you from singing... [Sobbing] It's all my fault... My fault... Nani... if you wouldn't have pulled me back would it have inspired me to achieve all this... [Crackers bursting] Get the luggage upstairs... I will. Sable Bhau... Happy Diwali to you... Didn't see you around? I was on a tour. But... wait... [Bell ringing] [Krushna] 'When the third bell rings on stage, ' 'no matter if your mother's dead' 'father's dead or your wife's disappeared, ' 'all an artist knows, is...' Krushna, get up. 'Show must go on'... 'Bhanumati suddenly left me.' 'The shock that she left with our four kids' 'was much worse... our four kids was much worse...' [Audience applauding] 'But I was on stage every night.' 'We were doing thirty or forty shows a month.' 'We were performing for white collared audience as well' 'in addition to our usual crowd from working class...' 'and they used to love it.' [Laughs] Oh, we know all these people... 'I used to hide all my grief away, and sing.' "That's Dhaniya and that one's Maniya," "And this one here's called Ganiya..." "That's Dhaniya and that one's Maniya," "And this one here's called Ganiya..." "All souls trapped in hell," "Suffering, sick and unwell..." "All souls trapped in hell," "All souls trapped in hell," "That's Dhaniya and that one's Maniya," "And this one here's called Ganiya..." "That's Dhaniya and that one's Maniya," [Krushna] 'After the show...' 'while removing layers of paint from my face...' 'all my despair would return in full force.' [Bhanumati] 'I had a dream. My verse and your voice.' 'But your voice is suppressing the poet in me...' 'So, I will stop here.' 'Even you should realise...' 'how far you can go as a balladeer' 'when you leave my verse behind.' [Krushna] 'Bhanumati's sudden departure' was a perpetually open wound for me. I was juggling the roles of writer, director, actor, singer, producer and while at home, the roles of mother and father... I was worried that the kids would feel ignored... and one fine day... someone walked into our lives like a breath of fresh air... [Knocking] Is your mother home? Who's there? Namaste... I'm Malati Kadam. Do you need anything? Bhanu tai? She doesn't stay here. Yeshu, come on... do your lesson... Yes baba. What's this? King Shahaji. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's father is king Shahaji. Baba, it hurts. Sorry sorry... I am trying to get this ponytail right... Baba, look at this horse. Charu, my neck, be careful... Yeshu, what are you looking at, write down... Yes, writing. I just have to tie the ribbon. Baba, what's this? Stories of Arjun and Krishna. Give it, I will do it. No, I can manage. No, I will do it. There's no problem, I can do it. Really, I will do it. Shahir Sable... Tell him, I will come. Victory to Maharashtra. Shivneri fort... say fort... Vasundhara, look up... What's this? Chhatrapati's mother and father Vasundhara look up... Shahaji Raje Bhosale and Jijamata... Shahir! Namaste Balasaheb! Namaste... Have a seat. You came as promised. Thanks. I read you Marmik I like it. What do you like the best? The column 'Read and do nothing!' I am disturbed by this heading. So I found the right person! Shahir, you have an organisation. Marathi Hitvardhini Sanstha (Organisation for the benefit of Marathi). We are on the same wavelength there. Shahir, you are an artist, a balladeer. You can ignite the spark in many. I have an idea! Tell me Balasaheb! Write a play. It's a controversial subject so underlying humour is a must. But it should not be just for entertainment. What disturbs us, should be put forth... People must introspect. [Chuckles] Why are you smiling? We actually are on the same wavelength. It's on my mind for some time Mumbai and Marathi Manoos... Excellent. Have you thought of a title? "Mumbai city is so tough..." "Any outsider sets up a shop here" "It happens time and again but no one's the wiser here..." "Common sense is gone, just pretension prevails," "Marathi Manoos is the third eye of Shiva," "He can destroy the injustice if only he cares enough..." [Music] Hey ...listen... Sir... just look where you're going, Can't you see this huge basket? [Laughs] Alright, now where are you coming from? I'm Zunjarrao Patil, from Marathwadi. Good good, so we're from the same area. Totally Pure Marathi. Why, are you adulterated? [Laughs] Everything's adulterated here. Yes, even I feel the same. I am asking everyone where Hutatma Chowk is but no one's saying a word. And the languages they use... Madrasi, Punjabi, Gujarati... What did you ask exactly? Hutatma Chowk. What? I said Hutatma Chowk. That's a mistake. How so? I you would've asked for Fountain, even a small kid would have directed you right here. [Laughs] Is that right? [Laughs] Thanks so much What did you say your name was? I didn't. No, I mean, what is your name? My name is... Ganpatrao... Ganpatrao... Friends call me Ganya, and the rich Mumbaikars call me... Coolie... [Laughs] Errr... These rich people just turned Ganpatrao into a Coolie... Tell me Ganpat... What were your ancestors like? You mean my great great great grandfather? Yes. They were great men. Really? They raided Surat, then called on the Delhi throne, and raised our flags high... And did you cut those flags... and made cloth pads for carrying goods? Why claim such magnificent ancestry... Why remember their courage... Why remember this history... "Those victorious drums have developed a crack" "Marathi Manoos is stepping back..." "Marathi Manoos is stepping back..." "We are smothered in our own home," "Carry on our shoulders someone else's load," "We are smothered in our own home," "Carry on our shoulders someone else's load," "Porter or a sacrificial goat," "In this intruder's attack..." "Marathi Manoos is stepping back..." "Marathi Manoos is stepping back..." Listen... keep this... Mai... Fold your hands. Let's have some fun... Mai... hold your hand out... This... for me... no... Mai... Just take it. Will you take it now? [Laughs] Happy Dasara. She's the one wearing white Jasmine flower garland... She's the one who dresses - Vasu, take the cups. Charu, that's very good... Charu, let's dance together... come on Bhauji, everyone must have lunch before leaving... food is ready... [Laughs] Oh yes... Mai, this feels like a household once more... and my Kisna is back to normal. Mai... better to have a modest lunch today... we don't want to relax... Its Shiv Sena's first Dasara rally. Victory to Shiv Sena... Long live Shiv Sena... Victory to Maharashtra Victory to Maharashtra Victory to Maharashtra Victory to Shiv Sena... Victory to Shiv Sena... Victory to Shiv Sena... [Radio news] 'In Mumbai... There's a huge public outcry in Dadar area.' 'Angry mob tried to burn down some taxis.' 'There's a deliberate attempt to anger Marathi public.' 'It's all happening because of that play...' 'Marathi Manoos deserves to get his right...' 'Matters began to heat up in Lalbaug today' 'and things escalated as it reached Visava hotel in Dadar.' 'Angry mob tried to burn down the hotel.' I wrote the play to show Marathi Manoos his mistakes and didn't know when it became political. I was never a political person and I tried to distance myself from what happened... But I felt guilty, and eventually it began to affect my work. [Indistinct chattering] Krushna... how many days will you spend dusting these instruments? We weren't supporting any political party... We existed before, and will remain after... Yes. Shahir, let the papers say anything... people know... you were not instrumental in instigating people... or turn them to violence. Yes... Shahir, let's begin something new... a new play... What an idea! No no Shahir, We must use a subject like 'Bapacha Baap' (Father's dad) 'Yamarajyat Ek Ratra' (A night in Death's kingdom)... Yes, correct. You're here... I will put the kettle on... Those plays were so much fun... Shahir, just hear me out... Don't you feel it? The humour in 'Yamarajyat Ek Ratra'... Mai, even I will have a cup, without sugar... Namaste Bhanumati tai... We were just discussing the new play... Don't you feel you are repeating yourself? Yes... That's why Shahir is writing something new... There are other writers... Just see... just see... You're sure to find something new... Yes. [Music] [Krushna] 'Bhanumati was right.' 'I decided to take her advice.' 'Vijay Tendulkar, Sai Paranjape, C T Khanolkar, ' 'P T Patankar... these great playwrights wrote the plays for me' 'in my style' 'and I began to perform them all over Maharashtra...' Footpayaricha Samrat Starring Raja Mayekar and Shahir Sable. Come one come all... Ticket rate 50 paise, Rs 1, Rs 2... Come one, come all... Namaste! Meet Jategaokar... He's arranged the show. Namaste Shahir Namaste Where's the venue? Right here. Tickets are getting sold as we speak. But where's the stage? Do we need it? We're just five hours short of showtime. I will manage it... Just coming Hey... Shahir... I don't think Jategaokar can manage it. Let me see. Why don't we visit the village... and see if something can be done? Come on... We'll just be back. Shahir, here's a funny thought... Just like we carry the set with us... why not carry the stage as well... Mayekar... Coming... Are you saying the entire theatre will fit in this truck See, the truck will open up and transform in a stage. This is an enclosure. They will sell the tickets here. Audience will sit here. This is our bus. We'll get ready in here. And the bus can park like this. I am calling this a Mobile Theatre. So, we can reach our people along with our stage... Right Mayekar? Shahir, it's like our circus. We have everything... Horses, camels, birds... a parrot... [Laughs] And a clown... [Laughs] Shahir... No... I haven't spoken to him in a couple of days... When we spoke... he mentioned that shows are unexpectedly getting cancelled. No, no, everything was fine before that... He's borrowed heavily to organize all this and now... [TV news] 'Now, a news about the drought in Maharashtra.' Let me call you back. 'Maharashtra have received deficient rainfall this year' 'and may once again face drought.' 'Government will make the official announcement' 'after analyzing the situation.' [Phone rings] The crowd was growing. People came to see the play but some just wanted to see the mobile theatre Without this drought we would have cleared your debt easily. See, when it comes to money arguments with 'if and when' have no meaning. The debt amounts to two lakhs and three quarters. Party is responsible for it. I am, not the party. Clearing the debt is my responsibility and I will do so by any means. [Music] "Let's take a walk through this barren forest oh Pal" "It's not yet time to rest, not yet time," "It's not yet time to rest, not yet time," "Partake this dried bread with water oh Pal" "It's not the time to rest, not yet time" "It's not the time to rest, not yet time" "Even when the life is ruined" "Even when the hurt's so deep," "The blaze of art within burns on..."

As god wills... That small piece of land... sold that as well. We haven't got anyone in trouble thus far... and we won't begin now. It's okay. We'll reclaim the lost ground. [Crying] We revived the older plays, we struggled a lot, but in vain. Have you seen the ECG... it goes up and down... Artist's life is like that. We wait for things to happen... for months... for years... Kedar... write down... Vasu... Just Ask Baba for money... Do it properly. Not like this. Ask her... Mai, I need some money. Mai, the rehearsal's at Dadar. If it's at Dadar, why don't you walk? Yeshu, she has to dance there at least 2 or 3 hours... be considerate. Charu, Vasu... these are the last 10 Rupees in the house. Anyone who can turn these into 20 Rupees, is allowed to go out [Phone rings] Baba, call from Kolkata, Ruma Devi... Tell her I'm out. Told her. She says she's calling for many years. Make it this year. Rumaji, Namaste. Sable Saab, will you come this year? See, people in Kolkata won't understand our Marathi songs. That's why I say no. Shahirji, music has no language. I am a great fan of yours... I have so many of your records, Jejuricha Khanderaya, Vinchu Chawala and Ya Vithucha and I love them all. You will have to come this time. It's settled. [Music] Charu, Vasu, our performance is after this, right? Yes. Will they like it? I am not used to all this now... Baba, Victory to lord Bhairava! [Clapping] Baba, Ruma Devi... Namaste. Namaste Namaste... Lots of VIP's are here, especially for you. There are writers, filmmakers... They will really enjoy your performance All the best! Presenting now Folk songs and dance of Maharashtra. From Mumbai, Shahir Sable and Party. [Clapping] Namaste. I am Shahir Sable. In Maharashtra, the song we have about marriage... Let's begin... [Music] "Who is the groom that's coming down the pier..." "Who is the groom that's coming down the pier..." "His sisters are so thin and petite..." "His sisters are so thin and petite..." "They are wearing Paithani Sarees..." "They are wearing Paithani Sarees..." "They are wearing floral garlands in their hair..." "They are wearing floral garlands in their hair..." "Anklets on their feet, are making sweet music..." "Anklets on their feet, are making sweet music..." [Clapping] [Train horn blares] [Group singing in Bengali language] Charu tai, please join us... Charu, join them... go... Vasu, there should be such exchange of music. Ruma Devi is right. Music should have no barrier of language. I agree. Baba, you had collected a lot of folk songs for HMV, right? Yes, what of it? Get them out of the storage. Why? I want them. [Music] Vasu, the script is good. What next? You can do the choreography. But my shows... I know you are busy, but... No, we can do this. For Baba, we must do this. "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Bless us, save us, O lord Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Bless us, save us, O lord Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Prayers are answered by great lord Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Prayers are answered by great lord Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Jejuri fort's turned golden O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Jejuri fort's turned golden O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Fort with 9 lakh steps O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Fort with 9 lakh steps O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "My lord's nearing the fort O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "My lord's nearing the fort O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Smearing the lord's Bhandara, Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Smearing the lord's Bhandara, Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Lord is the sheltering sky O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Lord is the sheltering sky O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Lord is the strength and support O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," "Lord is the strength and support O Malhari," "Hey we're blessed by lord Malhari," The next generation created something that helped me back on my feet. No Shahir As you sow, so shall you reap. If you hadn't inculcated certain values in them, then... Can I take autograph, please? She said... I got that. I never dreamed that someone out here... would want an autograph of a seventh class fail. It happened because of the sensitive audience like you. You keep the folk artists and the folk art alive. We need to be proud of our Marathi language... our art, songs, literature, our heritage. We have nothing if not that.
