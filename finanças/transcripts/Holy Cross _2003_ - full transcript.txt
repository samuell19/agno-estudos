SARAH: Nothing is getting me in front of that. I'd say the wrong thing. I always do. KAREN: Uh, Mum, you promised. SARAH: Like I had a choice! Something wrong? KAREN: It's the camera, it always... Got you! Mum, I'm so never going to talk to you again. Yeah. Promises, promises! Karen Norton. "Where I Live" for Mrs Lawson, class six. This is my room. My mum bought all my Britney posters for me. I've got more, but I've only space for my favs. I used to have the other room at the back of the house, but my mum says it was too dangerous, so she moved me in here. My mummy sleeps in my old room now. This is my mum's view out the back. Uncle Peter built that. But my mum wants the government to build a proper wall there. Mum and I talk about everything: TV, clothes, music. When I grow up, I'm going to look after her. (KNOCKS ON WINDOW) She's the coolest mum in the world. Most of the time. Those are the houses on the other side of the wall. That girl goes to the other school. This is Uncle Peter, my mum's brother. Uncle Peter moved again, Mum! You haven't forgotten that dole interview at 3:00, have you? -No. -(CHUCKLES) KAREN: He lives with us. We're Protestant. This is our street, Glenbryn Park. I don't know why it's called a park, cos it's a road. That's Dawn, my mum's best friend. -All right, Karen? Is this your homework? -Yes. Guess you don't want me saying nothing rude to your teachers, do you? -Oh, Dawn! -What? KAREN: Sorry, Mrs Lawson. My best friend Sonia. She used to live there. But her and her mum moved away. A lot of people have moved away. My mum works here. She says she comes here for a rest. She means from me. This is our school, Wheatfield. -My mum says it's better than any other school around here. -(CHILDREN PLAYING) And this, this is me. Hello! Don't! That's Holy Cross, the school opposite ours. They wear red because they're Catholic. -ALL: Fenians! Taigs! -BOY: Shut up! BOY: (SIGHS) I'll have to start over. CHILDREN: # They ask us, where do we come from? # We tell them we're from Holy Cross # They ask us, we tell them # They ask us, where do we come from? # We tell them we're from Holy Cross # They ask us, we tell them # We're from Holy Cross # We're from Holy Cross Who we are We're from Holy Cross # Where do we come from? # Tony, are you deaf? School or else! -Have you seen my ribbons? -No. You tell him one thing, he does the opposite. He could sleep through the Olympics. If you touch that again, you're dead! Right, I'm away here, Ann. I've got a fare booked. I want to be early for it. See you later, girls. Bye, Daddy. -You're going to be late. -That'll be a change. We'll get you ribbons when you go to school in September, okay, Tootsie? Right, come on, you two monkeys. -Bye. -Mum... Come on, out, out, go, go. Works better with bread in it. (DOOR BANGS) -(CAR HONKING) -Off the road! Do you not listen to a word I say? -I said stand still. What did you do? -The opposite, Mummy. -Sorry, Mummy. -Go on, you'll be late. -Siobhan? -Siobhan. You work hard, love, okay? -What does "opposite" mean, Mummy? -Go on, Trouble. No sign of Jackie again. We'll have to go on without any minutes, unless... Thanks, Sarah. -I spent this morning with the Community Police Liaison Crew. -Great. The CPLC again. -Statistically, they said, there's not enough attacks... -They're taking the piss! -I don't believe this. -...to warrant extending the wall. See if they lived here for a day. So, we need find other solutions. -Like what? Move out? -Uh, that's what they want, isn't it? We move out, and they move the Fenians in! We need to start by reporting every single attack. How come we never get nothing? So, every time some wee Fenian who throws a stone or a firework, we're supposed to call the cops? -They'd do us for wasting police time! -I know you're upset. By the time the cops get here, the Fenians have pissed off. We need a wall! -These things take time... -Harry, we don't have time. Any money, they'll walk in here, they'll walk all over us and they'll have us out of our houses by the end of the year. -Aye, my house is on the front line. -It's our house, Sarah. We need that wall, now. I know, but you know how these things are. They don't happen overnight. They throw paint at my house and they put bricks through my windows. Like, I've put everything that I've got into that house, we all have, but I can't move my house. -We're all in the same boat, Sarah. -No, Harry, we're not. You live one street away and that might as well be the other side of town. -I'm sorry. -No. Sorry is not enough any more. Mountain View, that used to be mixed. See those houses there? They used to be ours. And the same there and there and there. And where were the cops then? We're surrounded. Why wait? Give them to the first taig you see. Tell them... Tell them it was nothing. (DOOR SLAMS) Have a go on the slide. (SIGHS) They're worse than bloody kids. At least kids have sense! But, I mean our Peter... Like, we're sitting there talking about the safety of the house and the safety of the street and all he can come out with is, "Oh, it's our house, Sarah." -There's a chance he might wise up. -You think so? He's a man. (SCOFFS) They'll not force us out. We'll get that wall, I promise. -Oh, I hope so. -And don't you be worried about Karen. She could do worse than turn out like her Ma. -I'll say one word. Me. -(BOTH LAUGHING) -Right! - Who wants a story? -CHILD: I do! -Yeah... Yes. -What about a scary story? -(CHILD YELLING IN EXCITEMENT) MAN 1 ON RADIO: 92 to 95 FM. MAN 2 ON RADIO: It'll be dry and breezy today... -(REVVING ENGINE) -(IRISH MUSIC PLAYING) Gentle! -Ulster's effin' finest. Come on, who's up? -Come on. Don't be looking at me like that. I've done my back in. How? Getting out of bed? (IRISH MUSIC CONTINUES) -Hey, bud. -Yo! -Take that piece of shite down. -What? -That comes down, or you do. -Yeah, I'd like to see you try, Provie. (ENGINE REVS) -Look out! Look out! -(CAR TYRES SCREECHING) The obvious benefits of introducing an enriched curriculum to the school are shared learning... -Headmistress, I'm sorry to interrupt... -Excuse me a moment, please. (MEN SHOUTING) I'm really, really sorry for interrupting you. No, you did right. How did it start? It's Tuesday, I think it's our turn. Mrs Tanney, how are we going to get home? Don't worry, it'll be fine. -Get them inside, now. -Okay. Okay girls, I'd like you to line up, please! You lying bastard. You drove at us, first. Aye, after you smashed my window! -TEACHER: Please follow me, very, very quietly. -Where's my daddy? TEACHER: Thank you. No running, thank you. We can put our flag where we want to, boy. Everyone, just calm down. -I'll not miss next time, so I won't. -Let the children through, -and then we can talk about... -Ah, talk. What the hell good did talk ever do? The children are trying to get home. -They're not getting through. -They have nothing to do with this! This is about you. Not them. This is not your road! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) -My kid's up there. -This is our road. Your road? -What's that up there? -Those are our streets. -That's our Catholic school. -That school shouldn't even be there. Your days of walking up here are over. -They're our fucking Catholic kids! -Aye, in our fucking area! Ignore them? You can't miss them. Like night and day. Between the slamming doors and ignorant looks, my brain's addled. -Tony's a teenager, Ann. It's his job to wind your Gerry up. -Well, he's good at his job. MARY: Lock him in his room. That should keep him out of trouble. ANN: Who? Gerry or Tony? (BOTH CHUCKLING) (ALL SHOUTING) -(ENGINE REVVING) -For Christ's sake! -They're just wee girls! -Mary! Let us through! -No one's getting through. -My girl's up there! They're murdering each other. I'll go in by myself. Please, just let me go through! -(BOTTLES SMASHING) -WOMAN: Jesus Christ! The girls are safe. Primary one to seven is empty. That's everybody. Good. We'll assemble them like we do for our fire drills. Only today we'll send them home out the back by St Gabriel's. Okay. Come on, Gerry, come on! (MOBILE RINGS) (BOTTLES SMASHING) Had his dad seven years. Never walked away from a fight in his life. He'd look after the place when you're not around. I don't know. I know which one the kids would like. He doesn't look the sharing type. That's all I'm saying. -(MOBILE RINGING) -What's he called? Yes, love? Psycho. Nah, I'm only messing. Dusky. Una. Una, just calm down, love. TEACHER: Come on, everybody. Be very careful coming down the hill. The bigger girls at the back, watch the smaller ones. Okay? (GRUNTS) Siobhan, just leave it. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Oh, fuck it! Siobhan! Siobhan! -(BREATHING HEAVILY) -(CAR HONKING) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (HORN HONKING) -I'm sorry, Mummy! -Shh, it's not your fault. You're safe now. It's all right, darling. It's all over. But I lost my homework. That's nothing to what I thought I'd lost. You're not hit or anything? I'm okay. I didn't see anything. I just... Siobhan, this isn't your fault, love, none of it. You hear me? -Kylie's in the car. -Is she okay? Come on, pet, let's get you inside. Call your mummy. Oh, decided to show your face. Teacher said we had to wait for the trouble to stop. -Fenians. -Lucky I got you back at all then. Better get her home. They've been going buck mad out there. I'm not leaving you on your own, Dawn. You're not. Home, or else. I don't want to hear you using language like that, do you hear me? Sorry, Mum. Everyone at school says they want us out of Glenbryn. I don't want to leave. Let's just see what happens when you run out of walls for your Britney posters. Come on, before the shops close. You mean before it kicks off outside again? Right, before it kicks off outside again. Siobhan? Ann? Siobhan! (CHILD GIGGLES) Hey, Tootsie. Hey, Kylie. Come on, let's go in, love. It's getting dark. But it's daytime, Daddy. No, come on, we'll play inside, Aoife. Come on, Kylie, you come in too, love. -You can be Janey, Daddy. -Aye, all right. Hey, where's your mummy? Hey, where's my princess? -I hear you had the boys in the street fighting over you. -No, they were... We'll have to get you some security, woman. Maybe hire a couple of bouncers. "Hey, that's it, that's enough now. No more photographs, "no more autographs. Miss McClure wants to be alone. Wait!" Ah, there you are. I knew you were there somewhere. Hey... -(WHISPERING) Do you want sausages for your tea? -With chips? Talk about Daddy's wee favourite! Gerry... Ann, I'm awful sorry, love. I know. I should have been here. I should have had the mobile. I'm sorry, love. I'm awful sorry. I just kept imagining the worst. Well, I promise you, the worst is over, all right? It's over. Come here. (SNIFFLES) Riot police had to protect children and parents at a school in North Belfast this afternoon, after they were attacked by a gang of stone throwers. -(KNOCK AT DOOR) -REPORTER: It happened at Holy Cross primary school -on the Ardoyne Road. -I'll get it. Police then had to separate rival groups after a standoff developed... -Hiya. -It's okay. She's fine. Jesus, Seamus, that's some love bite. He'll have the matching pair when I get him home. Bloody Hun tried to close the school. Well, look, the main thing is they're all okay, right? Wankers. If they want to start something, we finish it. And next time, we'll be ready for them. You missed it. I swear, I've never seen or heard nothing like it. How many have you had? This is Glenbryn. Nothing changes here. Nothing happens here, nothing good, I mean. We stood together there. You should have been here, man. Speak to my dole advisor. Maybe they can change my category, "actively seeking riots". Mmm. Beer. I'm drinking your beer. That's the only thing that's changed. You're wrong and you're staring at it. I wasn't here last night. Those weren't there last night and neither was that. That's cos of us. Not the politicians, us. You hear me? (YELLING) Come on! Come on! -You think they heard that? -Couldn't miss it. We did it. We shut them out. This is our road again. Hmm, it's early yet. Is today Saturday? You know, Seamus was saying Gary had to use a wheel brace to protect himself? Well, it must be true, then. No, love, it's Tuesday. It's like every other fight around here, never matters who starts it, -it's never over. -Is it a special day, then? No, darling, it's just a normal day in Ardoyne. But what's right is right. Right? Is that why we're having chips? It's in the oven, love. Lights! I was at a mate's, all right? -Bollocks. -Gerry! If you've been out causing trouble, I'll find out about it. -Worse than a prison. -What did you say? Gerry, let it go. We won't find out cos he was at a mate's house. And you. You are not to use that language like that. Is that understood? Yes, Mummy, that's a bad word. Good girl. It's a sad day when we have to follow our children's lead. How many times have you heard me warn him about leaving those lights on? All right. "Fuck" is a bad word as well, Mummy, isn't it? (SNICKERING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (MOBILE RINGING) Sean? No, it's all right, I can talk. Yeah, I can hear it and I can see it. No, it's no problem. I should be able to marshal for a couple of hours. Yeah, see if you can stop as many as you can getting up Alliance Avenue. I'll head on up to the peelers' line. Give, uh, look... I'll ring you in a couple of minutes, mate, yeah? All right, bye. (GLASS SHATTERING) You're going out after what happened today? Especially after what happened today, love. The girls sleep easier when you're here. This way, maybe everybody will get some sleep tonight. You won't even notice I've gone. Sure. -(GLASS SHATTERING) -(SHOUTING CONTINUES) (DOOR BANGS) (DOOR BANGS) -Mum? -Are you okay? I can't sleep. Do you want me to sleep in here beside you to keep you company? (WHISPERING) It's all right, love, we're safe in here. Really? Of course we are. It'll blow over in the morning. It always does, doesn't it? Then why are you still whispering? Because it's dark. Close your eyes, now, love. -Did you bring the phone? -Of course, Toots. Go to sleep now, love. -(YELLING OUTSIDE) -(LOUD SMASHING) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) It's okay, it's only wee lads messing off. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Right, party's over, boys. I'll have that. -You, get home, now. -Go home? Oh, yes. Fancy your chances, do you? Go on! Get out of it! Go on! -(INDISTINCT SHOUTING) -(HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (BANGING) (BANGING CONTINUES) Turn that off! Turn it off! Go to your room now, Karen. -I'm not asking, I'm telling. Go! -(DOOR OPENS) PETER: (DRUNKENLY) Sarah, it's only me! I've lost my keys. Hi, Sarah, can I... (SHUSHING AND GIGGLING) You're waking Karen up. (MEN SNICKERING) SARAH: Come on. Pretend it's daytime. It's safer in daytime. It's bright. The sky's blue. People smile. It's always safer in daytime. Pretend it's daytime. It's safer in daytime. Pretend it's daytime. It's safer in daytime. Pretend it's daytime. It's safer in daytime... REPORTER 1: Public enquiry starts today to find out if Harold Shipman murdered hundreds of his patients. REPORTER 2: There was rioting in North Belfast last night, following an incident yesterday at Holy Cross primary school. Police called to keep rival factions apart were themselves a target of attacks, but the area is now calm. Peter! Peter! -Waken up now! -I'm up. I'm awake. I am this close to kicking you out. I am sick seeing you like this, always lying about the house. Look at yourself! And get him out of my house! -You're not my ma. And this is our house. -Who pays the mortgage? -Who organises the bills and who cleans your mess? -I do my share! Karen does more than you do. Peter, listen to me, because I can't do this any more. Look at yourself! Open your eyes! What's going to change it? Nothing! What's going to change you? God, if looks could kill! She's a real ride when she's angry. She hates me, right? She's right. You should listen to her. (DIALING) Don't you have school kids to go and bully? (SCOFFS) -Morning, Uncle Peter. -Morning. (SNIFFS) (SNIFFS) Are you all right, Princess? -You're up early. -So? -Gerry! -What? In one ear, out the other. -Mobile! -Mobile. Daddy, will you take us to school today? (SIGHS) Good parking, Dawn. When are you putting in for the test? Sorry, mate. I've gotta run. Later. They'll only be back again tonight, you know? Are you gonna just stand there or you gonna do something useful? (SIGHS) Harry. What's happening? Nothing. You can't do this. We've no option but to close the road. We can't guarantee your safety. What do you mean our safety? There's only a dozen or so of them. You're protecting them, right there. Look at them. Standing there, laughing at us. I walk up here every day. I'm not walking the long way for you! -Take it easy, big man. -Move back, sir, it's for your own protection. Look, they're the ones causing the trouble. Do your jobs, why don't you? Move them back. OFFICER: McClure. Move back. Oi, you! What the hell are you doing here, you Provie bastard! You're dead! You hear me? -I'll take Siobhan round the back. -You heard me? You're dead! -You Provie! -Gerry, you hear what I said? There's parents taking their kids 'round through St Gabe's. -Daddy... -No kid of mine is going to school through a back door. It's not a back door, it's a field. Do you know how long it takes to walk around that way? Listen to yourself. They're doing you a favour, come on. You could do with the exercise, come on. It's all right, love. The bad boy's just playing. (CROWD YELLING AND TAUNTING) (MOUTHING) I'm sorry, the school's closed. Oh, that's great, the Prods will just love that. The Board of Governors feel that because of the tension in the area, we have no option but to close the school today. So, what? Just ignore what we want, is that it? Come on. It's in the best interests of the girls. Please, I know you're upset... I would have thought an education was is in the best interests of the girls. (ALL MURMURING AGREEMENT) Come on, love. That's very funny. That's the new you. I thought you'd be back in bed. How's the head? -Which one? -Are you joining us? See? See that? It's working. Ben! Go make us a bacon bap, would you? Pete? What? No, it's a bit early for me. All right, Sarah. What are you doing here? There's a meeting later on about all this. You'll be there, right? I'll check my diary. Look, I'm all for doing something, but closing a school? Hey. We stopped them walking to school. We didn't close it. They did that themselves. It's about time we stood on our own two feet. They won't give us a wall, we'll make our own. Most of them are just out of prison. The Provisional IRA, Provies. -I know what a Provie is, Roy. -What are they doing, walking up here? I don't know, Roy, maybe they're just trying to take their kids to school. Siobhan, Siobhan, Siobhan! -(EXCLAIMS) -(GASPS) You missed. Na na na na... (LAUGHING) I like it when you don't go to school. Uncle Peter, I need one more interview for my video diary. Go on, then. It'll have to be quick, mind you. I've an important meeting with Roy. -Drinking? -Hey... Free nosh down at the Concorde. Fire away. First question. Why did you steal my mum's bike and sell it when she was wee? Straight in with the boot, Karen. No holding back, nothing or anything, huh? -So, it's the full Jeremy Paxman, is it? -Uncle Peter, don't! No, sorry. -There's no proof I did it. -My mum says you told her. No, see, there's your first mistake. Don't be listening to everything your ma tells you. Sarah's not going to see this, is she? You should always listen to everything your mummy tells you. Listen, it was a really, really rubbish bike. And if you think about it, I was looking out for her. I mean, it was pink. Pink! There's a reason why they don't make pink bikes any more, you know. -Besides, it's what I do. -What do you do? -Annoy you and your mummy. -Uncle Peter, this is serious. This has to be in for tomorrow. -(PARPS) -This is your last chance! What do you want to be when you grow up? Uncle Peter, what do you want to be when you grow up? (SCOFFS) (APPLAUSE) HARRY: Can we have a bit of order? Please! I've had my windows put in twice in the past month, eight times in the past six months! You know, I was cutting the grass the other day, a brick missed me by this much! Please, everyone will get a chance to talk if you'll just... These streets used to be ours! I remember when it used to be a nice place to live! (ALL MURMURING AGREEMENT) You had your windows put in one night, didn't you? Your Karen was covered in glass. If it's not the Provies, it's their kids. They keyed my car, last week. Brand new it was. My sister's kids are afraid to even play around here! I don't care, Harry, I'm not moving. If I've said it once, I've said it 1,000 times. What we need is a wall! (APPLAUSE) They get everything they want and still that's not enough! -Nothing changes, Norton, eh? Do you hear that? -Yeah. There's going to be a cross-community meeting. Better nip home and change into your riot gear. -Isn't that the woman that lives across from us? -Aye. This can't go on. We live side by side and we can't even talk to each other. They don't sort this out nice. She lives behind you and Gerry, doesn't she? Well, what's happening? They got a compromise that keeps everybody happy. Mothers and kids can walk up the left side of the road in single file. Piece of piss. What about the men who walk their kids to school every day? What sort of compromise is that? -That's what I said. -They think all the men down here are Provies. (CHUCKLES) What, him? Matt? Most of the lads that live around here have never had anything to do with the 'RA. It's like talking to a brick wall, mate. And I'm not involved any more. That was years ago. The only reason I was there today was because of the trouble yesterday, because Siobhan was too scared to walk to school with just her mother. The kids are safe to go back to school. That's the main thing, right? (SIGHS) Right. For God's sake, I thought the whole point of having this peace process was so we could -put all this kind this crap behind us. -It is. It is. -(EXPLOSION) -Aoife! Aoife, come here! Come here! -(CAR ALARM BLARING) -(DOG BARKING) (CROWD SHOUTING) No, you listen to me, right? I'm not having the UDA throw a blast bomb on my street and then tell me I can't walk my kids to school! -No way! -The Board of Governors, we... -Just do your job. -You can't give in to their threats! Please, we have taken your concerns into consideration. May 31st, they threatened a woman with a gun, and it jammed. June 1st, house on Alliance Avenue stoned. June 13th, they drove in and attacked our cars. June 14th, stoned houses. June 15th, more stones and paint bombs. Exactly! Everything they fire at one of us, -they fire at all of us! -That's right. Now, if you close that school tomorrow, what's that say to them? Holy Cross will be open tomorrow for pupils who wish to attend class. -At last! -(APPLAUSE) However, the RUC have informed us the road will be closed. What? Our kids have a right to walk that road with their parents, they have a right to education! -The police cannot guarantee your safety. -You mean will not? Families can still bring... I don't know about you, but I tell my kid to stand up to bullies. I tell her not to be afraid, because I'm here to protect her. -They want a protest. Fine, we'll get them a protest. -(APPLAUSE) We'll meet at the shops tomorrow, we'll walk to the police line ourselves, together. There'll be trouble tonight, Gerry. We'll need to keep a lid on it. Have you ever tried keeping a lid on a pressure cooker? (HUMS TUNE) I should be back about 12:00 or so, love. If I'm going to be late, I'll ring you. God knows what the hoods will be up to tonight. I'm going to the bog, okay? Would you prefer I piss myself here? Oi! Not in front of the girls! (SLAMS DOOR) If he goes out or gives you any trouble, ring me on the mobile. Yeah? -Ann? -Mmm-hmm. -All right, Tootsie? -We're going to the shops cos it's safe at daytime. That's right, my love. Now, listen. You be a good girl for your mummy, when I'm out. Yeah? -And you stay away from those windows at the back. Yeah? -What are you doing here? You're a dirty Provie, you're a dead man! (IMITATING GUNFIRE) REPORTER 1: It's become part of the school day for these parents of Holy Cross pupils, the walk to police lines, knowing there is no way through.

REPORTER 4: The situation remains. The children still have to go to school via another route. Mervyn Jess, BBC News, North Belfast. I'm just saying, nothing's simple any more. We can stand here till kingdom come, but there's still the door at the back. -At least the Provies are off our roads. -And doors can be shut. What do you mean?

Dawn, what are you doing? Something I should have done a long time ago. Charlie, leave that, will you? Get Billy to take that one. He's gonna do his back in again, I know it. Dawn, please don't! -Charlie, leave it! -Sarah, are you okay? Give it a few more nights, Dawn. We'll get the wall we want. -This is your home! -Home is where you look forward to going after work. Home is where you take little things for granted, like a night's sleep or not being afraid to put a light on for fear of getting a brick through your window. Bricks and mortar. That's all that is. And it's not worth dying for. They want it that bad, they're welcome to it. And if you had any sense, you'd do the same. I don't have anywhere else to go. Look, I know you grew up here, I know how much you love it, but anywhere, anything is better than this. Dawn, please don't go. If you go, I'm on my own. You said you wouldn't move. You said, "I'm not moving." You promised. Yeah, well, that was then. This is now. You take care of yourself. Okay? Are we going to move out, Mummy? Come on, you, let's get you some breakfast, huh? Then maybe we'll give the A-Team a call, huh? Mr. T. BA? Murdoch? Jesus wept, they teach 'em nothing at school these days. Karen, you should be filming this. This is history happening, here. Your uncle's doing some work. Some Twelfth, eh? What do you think? -I like it. -Welcome to Fortress Norton. No, I'll clear up this mess first.

Like when we went to the caravan. Exactly like when we went to the caravan. Don't I get a say in this? This room's safer. It's at the front of the house. You ready for this? Okay. Daytime, night time, daytime, night time, daytime, night time. (CONTINUES REPEATING) -Day, ni... Day... -Uh, I win! That's 10 cups of tea you owe me when you're bigger. -Double or nothing? -(GIGGLES) Daytime, night time, daytime, night time. Daytime, night time, daytime, night time, daytime, night time. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (DOOR CLOSES) -Lights. -Do you know what your problem is, Tony? You know nothing, but you've got a smart answer for everything. -I wonder why that is. -Don't flatter yourself, son. You're nothing like me. You're just a hood. You can't stand it, can you? That I'm the one out there. You're a big man when it comes to pushing kids around, Gerry-atric. You're such a fucking loser. (YELLING) If I hear so much as a whisper that you're out on those streets again running with that pack of losers... -What's going on? What's going on? -Ask him. -We'll talk tomorrow. -I haven't finished with you yet! Do you know what he was doing? What do you expect? He's your son. You knew? What do you want me to do? Say, "Don't be a bad boy, Tony, don't do what your father did?" -I was doing what was right. -Daddy... -Siobhan, you go back to bed. -Bollocks! You were in prison, I was doing what was right. I was doing what had to be done. I was here. Looking after our son! Oh, a grand job you did. He's a real credit to you. Must make you feel really proud. When he starts to keep Semtex under the floorboards of our house, then I'll worry. Siobhan, upstairs! -Please, stop shouting! -Bed now! You know what's the matter with him? You're not here half the time! He's following the same old footsteps and so am I. And we never talk about it. Nothing's changed, Gerry. Nothing! Everything I did, I did for this family. All I want is to protect you and the kids. Can you not see... (VEHICLES APPROACHING) REPORTER: Children from the Catholic Holy Cross primary school in North Belfast return to school today. For the first time since Loyalists blockaded their route in June. The talks to resolve the dispute haven't reached a solution. Some Protestants say they'll try to block the entrance again today. AMERICAN REPORTER: We begin with a terrifying morning for Catholic schoolgirls in Northern Ireland... (REPORTER SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey! How's the birthday girl? Darling, the first day is the worst. It'll get easier after this, I promise. -I cried my first day. -Really, Siobhan? -Aye, buckets! We had to go out and buy a new carpet. -(GIGGLES) Now, listen, your big present will be waiting for you when you get home from school, right? -Mummy. -Mum's gonna bring it 'round, later, right? -I know what it is! it's... -Ah! It's a surprise! Now, come on and we'll blow out these candles together and make a wish. Tony? Now if somebody wishes for a puppy, they shouldn't tell anybody. Because you can only say the opposite, otherwise it won't come true. Tony! Happy birthday, Tootsie. Right, are you ready? ALL: One, two, three... Go, go, go, go, go, go! Oh, yes! -Daddy... -What, love? Are we walking up the road today? REPORTER: The Chief Constable himself has promised that the children of Holy Cross and their parents will walk to class through the front door of their school, after they've walked up the road. A spokesperson said this action by the Chief Constable had disenfranchised the Protestant community. They're gonna force 'em through. The cops are gonna force 'em up our road. -(BANGING ON WINDOW) -ROY: Get out here now! The peelers are clearing us off our road. We need everyone out now! -Are you coming or what? -I have to take Karen to school. But you'll be there, right? They drive out Dawn. They drive out the neighbours. You gonna sit here on your own till they drive us out too? -Since when did you care? -Look, Sarah... You're the one who told me to wake up. Now, you listen to me. The only thing that is going to change this is that. I've never seen nothing like that before. That's not just Roy and his UDA mates, that's everybody! We don't have to take it any more. I still have to think of Karen, Peter, you don't... They hide behind their kids. You gonna do the same? (DOOR SLAMS) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Come on! (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) The school suggests that parents might want to use the alternative access. -If you choose to... -Alternative access, my arse! -We're walking. -Is it safe to take the kids through that? Do you want Aoife's first day at school being dragged through a field? -Did you hear me say that? -(CAMERA CLICKS) Look, what's right is right. They're not going to school through a mucky field. End of story. If those cops had done this from day one, we wouldn't be here, now. Excuse me. Are you afraid to walk up the road? I just want to take my kids safely to school. Okay? Is that what you wished, Mummy? Darling, if I told you that, it wouldn't come true, would it? (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) -This way, Karen. Just hold tight. -(MEN JEERING) This way. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry, coming through with a child. Excuse me. Sorry, I have to get through... No! Oh, my God! -Hold on! Karen! -Mummy! -Karen! I've lost my daughter! -(GLASS SHATTERING) Karen! My daughter's in there! Karen! -Karen! My daughter's in there! -Mummy! Karen! (CAMERAS CLICKING) You okay? You're all right, love. At least we don't have to walk 'round the back, this time. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) -Mummy. -Karen! -Mummy. -Karen. -I'm sorry, Mummy. -No, it's not your fault. Look at her. Look what you've done to her! Look at her. She's just 10! Does she look like a rioter to you? Does she? (THUDDING) We were just trying to walk to school! Are you happy now? You got what you wanted! Are you? (DISTORTED SHOUTING) (INAUDIBLE) Fenian bitches! Go on, you wee Fenian bitches! (JEERING AND TAUNTING) Scum! Scum! Get out! Scum! McClure, you Provie bastard! You're fucking dead! You'll not be living in that house too much longer! You hear me? Using your child like that, you're scum! -You Fenian bastard! -Don't listen to them, love. Just keep walking. We're nearly there, we're nearly there. (JEERING CONTINUES) Oh! Oh, Jesus! It's piss! -Animals, you're animals! -(LAUGHING) It's nearly over, close your ears! You're all right? Are you all right, love? The bad men keep shouting. I know, love. I know. I don't like it when the bad men shout either. But... But, I wish they'd go away as well. But, it'll get easier tomorrow, okay? Do you really believe that, do you? The ugly face of sectarian hatred was all too apparent at the gates of a Belfast school today, as terrified Catholic children ran the gauntlet of an angry Protestant mob. REPORTER: The first day of school and a riot police escort is needed for pupils and parents. Some of them the target of stone throwers, as they went through the gates. -(GLASS SHATTERING) -And in the midst... Setting it? REPORTER: ...five and six year olds. The police promised... Using their kids to walk up our road. Karen, love, time to get ready for bed. (REPORTER CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND) What's he doing there? You walk Karen up to school everyday. When do you ever see him walking his kids up our road? When? -Never. -Exactly. Never. He's not walking his kids up to school. He's walking all over you and me and your Karen. Beating us off our road for monsters like him? Should be in prison, where he belongs. Bloody cops won't be happy till we're all dead in our beds. Using their kids like that. They're monsters. That's what they are, monsters. The RUC have assured me that the Perspex tunnel will not be deployed again tomorrow. I think they recognise that today could be improved upon. -Improved upon? The problem was their bloody tunnel. -Wasn't their tunnel. It was the protesters. They shouldn't have been there. It's a nightmare. That's what this is, a nightmare. Look, what happened today wasn't human. The governors are right. I'm not putting my girls up through that tomorrow. What? You're walking away? To put my daughters through that wasn't human. What? So, you're saying I'm not human? Is that what you're saying? No, that's not what I am saying. What? I am not fit to walk past their doors? I'm not human, cos the UDA says so? Holy Cross today, St Gabe's tomorrow, the other three Catholic schools the day after that. Is that what you want, Sean? If that was a gang of skinheads blocking a street in England, we'd shift them then. Aye. But because our girls are Catholic and they're Protestant, it's okay to ignore us? Exactly! Gerry, talk to him. I don't know, Matt. If they could've killed the girls today, they would have. What, you're listening to him? Well, people don't change overnight. Some things come to the surface, but they don't change. They're monsters, you hear me? Monsters! I'm just saying. Everyone has to make their own decision, their own choice. And I've made mine. Sean, wait a minute. Sean! Look. I fixed it. See, you can't even see the tear. It's like it never happened. Please, Mummy. I want to leave. I don't want to live in Glenbryn any more. (SHUSHING) You're just scared. Don't be. I'll look after you, okay? I'll protect you. (WHISPERING) Okay. REPORTER 1: The headlines this morning. Parents in North Belfast decide whether to take their daughters back along the main route to Holy Cross primary. REPORTER 2: It's one of the ugliest examples of sectarianism the public has seen for many years... You all right, Ann? Gerry? How's it going? All right. Fine. You all right, love? Come on, darling. MARY: I went to that school. We all did. I don't want to walk over anybody. I just want to walk my kid to school, safest way possible. You ask any mother what comes first and they'll give you the same answer: their kids. REPORTER: What about the death threat from the Red Hand Defenders, on the Holy Cross parents? MARY: You bloom where you're planted. Now that is a brilliant wee school and the girls would not be happy anywhere else. Look at him. Coward! I don't know how he can show his face, using the back door. GERRY: You know what, Matt? You can be a real asshole sometimes, mate. We need everybody to stick together, as we go past the protesters. The front broke forward yesterday, it leaves you exposed. You have to stick together. (CROWD CHANTING) Scum! Scum! Fenian Scum! Scum! Scum! Fenian Scum! (CHANTING CONTINUES) -(CHANTING FADES) -Scum! Scum! Fenian scum! (SARAH ALONE) Scum! Scum! Fenian scum! You should be ashamed of yourself, walking your... (SILENCE) (SIGHS) I can never... You see the way her wee face lit up when Spike ended up here after school? Collie was the right choice, wasn't it? Gerry, tell Matt you've changed your mind. (MOCK KISSING) Come on, boy. Oh, fine. Ignore me. What... What if they took a shot at you? What if they hit the girls? They know you. They know what you've done! Yeah, "done." Past tense, Ann. Way past tense. Every time you go up that road you put the girls at risk. I am protecting them. Look, what would you tell them in 10 years' time? We did nothing. We walked away. While they threatened our kids. Mary's kids. While they closed that school. Is that your answer? Is it? I don't have the answer! ANN: I... I am not worried about 10 years down the line. I am thinking about how to get through tomorrow and the day after that. (SIGHS) I am not walking up that road with you tomorrow. I am taking them 'round the back. No daughter of mine is going to school through the back door. Right, over my dead body! Well, Gerry, you go on the walk tomorrow, there's plenty of them up there who'd be happy to oblige. Right. Fine! I'll take them up by myself. I can't do this any more! It's too hard on the girls... It's... I know, I know. (ANN SOBBING) Look... You think this is easy for me? I know you're scared. Christ, I'm scared. Look, we'll get through this. -I promise you... -Oh, Gerry I... Don't make promises you can't keep, no... These people, they look at you, they don't see what I see. They don't see my husband, they don't see a father. I can't change how they see me. What's right is right... -...and you know it! -Oh fucking here we go. You know, once... I would really like to talk to Gerry McClure, the father, not Gerry McClure, the voice of the people. (DOOR SLAMMING) You okay? The people you saw, on the road are not bad people. They're just people like us. They're angry that they're being treated like nothing. And nobody listens and nobody cares and they're just scared. They're just people like us. And if they do something that seems wrong, it doesn't mean that it is wrong. Cos sometimes, the right thing seems wrong and... If people call them monsters, for making kids cry, well... I have to cry for you. And monsters don't cry. Where'd Daddy go, Mummy? Aoife, come on. Is Daddy coming back soon? Aoife, for God's sake, hurry up. Kylie's got plenty of dolls you can play with. Good girl. I've been married for 20 years. Gerry going to prison, raising Tony. Gerry getting out of prison, I thought the worst was behind me. You know, Ann, this isn't just about you and Gerry. No matter what we... (SIGHS) No matter what I think or what I decide, I'm doing wrong by the girls. I'll have to answer to them in 10 years and if I do the right thing... I don't have the answer now. I can't breathe. Knowing the things they have seen, things they shouldn't have seen. They're different. Harder. Oh, Gerry. I'm losing my family. What is wrong with going through St Gabe's? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Only, if we all don't walk, we all lose the school. It's never over, is it? No. It's never over. (DOOR SLAMMING) Mum! Mum, are you here? Mummy! Dad? (DOOR SLAMMING) (DOOR OPENING) (LOUD THUDDING) (GLASS SHATTERING) Clear off! They're just kids mucking about. They're not kids, Roy. They're hoods. And hoods are no help to anyone. -You all set for tomorrow? -Yep. Round three. Ding ding. Come outta your corner fighting. Klaxon. Check. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Check. Hello, Pete. -(GROWLING) -(LAUGHING) Hey, cheer up, Sarah. It might never happen. What if it already has? Here, Sarah. Why the long face? (SNICKERING) (WHISPERING) Gerry. You have to talk to Tony. I'll get Seamus to give me a hand and put some grills on in the morning. (HAMMER THUDDING) Fuck you! Fuck you all! You are all animals! (BREATHING RAPIDLY) REPORTER 1: No sign of an end to the standoff. We're live in North Belfast, at the Holy Cross primary school, where the army is out in force this morning. REPORTER 2: Parents in Belfast vow to take their daughters past Loyalist protesters, for third day running. (DRILL WHIRRING) (MUFFLED POP MUSIC PLAYING) Karen, is everything all right? Karen? (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) Less fear today. Maybe the worst's over. You look tired. We're not walking down the road today. Look, Ann, we've had this argument, love. They are not second class citizens, neither are we, we're not taking them 'round the back, right? I wish you would listen to me just once. (SIGHS) I'm taking them, by myself. I want you here. You want them to die in this road for the principle, you want them through the front door of their school, fine. I'll do it. But I'll do it alone. All these years, by my side, knowing who I was. You do this now? Jesus, I ain't doing nothing wrong here... This isn't about you. OFFICER: Keep together. You have to stick together. ANN: You're right, Gerry. I am tired. -Come on, darling. -Mummy? Daddy's gonna walk with us, Mummy, isn't he? Please? Daddy, no! Don't go, Daddy, please! I want Daddy. I want Daddy to come! Daddy, no! Daddy! No! Siobhan! Siobhan, come back! Siobhan, what are you doing? Mummy's looking after you. Ann! Come on. (CROWDS TAUNTING) Can you see Mummy, Daddy? (CROWDS CHANTING) Scum! Scum! (INAUDIBLE) (CHANTING FADES) (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLOSION) (SHRIEKING) Siobhan! (SCREAMING) WOMAN: Shoot the bastards! Shoot them! Siobhan! (CROWD SCREAMING) (SHOUTING IN PAIN) Mummy! (ALL CRYING) It's over. I promise. It's over now. (CHILDREN CRYING) Sarah? Sarah! Sarah, are you all right? Excuse me. Were you here? What did you see? What, what happened? Yeah, I, I was here... Uh, something was thrown at the cops, right? Not the parents or the kids. The cops. That's what happened. No, Sarah, wait. At least they'll listen to us now. Do you realise what you've done? I did nothing. I was just here. -You lose something? -Hmm. REPORTER 1: Children make their way to a Belfast primary school. The Northern Ireland secretary called it "the path to barbarism." REPORTER 2: Some here claim the bomb had been directed at security forces, and that it had been thrown by someone from outside the area. For a time, it seemed to cause a rethink about future protests. I am ashamed today, to say that I am a Loyalist. I'm totally ashamed that anybody would do that when young Catholic girls are coming up here. Totally ashamed. MAN: My recommendation to people would be, forget the protest, -because nobody's hearing what's going on now... -(DOOR OPENS) Billy Hutchinson. Bit late to be talking sense now, isn't it? Kids finally got to sleep. Never thought I'd listen up, but... Had to give Siobhan a Calpol. (SIGHS) MARY: Ann? They're saying it's over, girls. Where's your mum? Upstairs? Twelve weeks terrorising our kids and they get what they want. This country's sick. (CRYING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) MARY: Ann! It's over. (WAILING) It's over, Ann. (SOBBING) REPORTER: Some news just in, Loyalists in Belfast have tonight suspended their protest at Holy Cross girls' school in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast. This week, the protest had entered its 12th week... They say we're getting ramps, CCTV and a turning circle at the school. (APPLAUDING MOCKINGLY) That is class. Pure class. Nice one. So, is this what winning feels like? Harry, we are going to get the wall, aren't we? Yes, CPLC said that... Sarah. Not exactly overnight. But still, 12 weeks, not bad. (DOOR SLAMMING) SARAH: Karen, you there? (DOOR CLOSES) Karen? Whatever you think of me and what I have done, if it was wrong, I could lose everything. But, I'd have nothing if I lost you. You're the one thing I've done right, Karen, and I know that sorry is not enough, but it's all I have. You know you can always talk to me, right? WOMAN: McClure? Siobhan and Aoife McClure? Siobhan back at school yet? It's her birthday tomorrow. Look, I've told the other mothers, these tranquilisers are strong. So, make sure you don't exceed the stated dose, all right? -(DOOR SLAMMING) -(BELL RINGING) I don't like it when you don't go to school. You know what I wished for? Shhh. Mummy says if you tell, it'll never come true. You can only say the opposite. Mummy says that's allowed. I wished... I wished Daddy would stay away forever.
