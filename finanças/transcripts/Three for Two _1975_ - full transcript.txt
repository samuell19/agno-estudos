(soft upbeat music) (cars honking) - Ah, Roma, Roma. Mi amore, I love you, I feel like everything I've been waiting for my whole life, will come true here tonight. (singing) (doorbell ringing) (speaking in a foreign language) Yes, you should put it right over there by the table. - Si, graze. - Oh, it is so beautiful out on the terasse, perhaps you should put it out here. Oh, and don't forget the candelabra, no, hold it, hold it, maybe the terrasse is a little obvious perhaps you better put it right here by the table. And you can go ahead and open it because my husband's in the shower and he'll be out in a moment. - Yes. - I, I guess perhaps you're wondering why I'm dressed like this? Well you see, this is the first time in 24 years we've been on a vacation without the children, and we're going to have four romantic weeks together and I'm, shall we say, setting the mood. (chuckling) (popping) Can I ask you a personal question? (speaking in a foreign language) Do you, like my ensemble? - Bellisima. - That means good? Oh now are you sure sir? Because I have the same thing in mediterranean blue, and midnight black, you'll have to excuse me for being so, so emotional, it's just that I'm so happy. I want everything to be just perfect for my husband, because he's really so sensitive to his environment, and this is our first night here in Rome, the eternal city of love. Here he comes. - (mumbles) - Herb! - What? - Uh, Herb darling, the champagne is poured and the waiter is waiting to take your order so we can have our romantic supper. - Oh, let me see a menu pal. I'll have some of that spaghetti carbonara. - Yes sir. - Side of meatballs. Bowl of minestrone. An order of steak pitsiola, and a chocolate profiterole, some fresh strawberries, no sugar. You got any good cheese? (speaking in a foreign language) - Yeah, I'll have those, and some black coffee. With skim milk. Wake me up Sally as soon as it comes. - Uh, I think I'll order now if you don't mind. Um, I'll have some of that spaghetti, carbon, whatever, and a tossed salad and a cup of espresso. Thank you. Herb darling, what are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing, I'm trying to get some sleep. You realize it's two o'clock back in Cleveland? - That's two in the afternoon, Herb. - Please Sally, will you give me a break? The pressure's beginning to get to me. - What pressure honey? We're on vacation. Herb, you haven't called your office, have you? You promised me you wouldn't. - I have not called my office. I don't wanna even think about business. And I resent your insinuation. (phone ringing) - Hello? It's your office returning your call. - Hello Phil? Oh, hmm, well I was just calling you to tell you not to call me, unless it's an emergency, we're gonna be here in Rome for about three days. Uh? - Venice. - Thank you. - Tell her she can call me at 324862. In Capri it's 462212 and 856224 in the ruins of Pompeii. You got that pal? Ciao! - I hope you feel better Herb, because all I wanna do is have us look into each other's eyes for the next four whole weeks. - I know. - Herb? This is not romantic, you're not relating to me at all. I'll bet you haven't even noticed what I'm wearing. - You're wearing blue pajamas. - I am wearing a coral negligee, you are wearing blue pajamas - All right, I'm wearing blue pajamas, you're not, what's the difference? - Herb, I don't know how to tell you this, but now that the children are out on their own, all I'm left with is you. - I'm getting very tense Sally. Very tense. What do you want from me? - Not much Herb, let's have some champagne. Here. Wait Herb, wait, wait, let's sit next to each other on the sofa, it's more romantic there. Hold it, hold it, don't you think we should toast each other? - Right now? (soft Italian music) - To Rome and love and laughter and to you and me, husband and wife, man and woman, loving each other more than heaven could ever imagine. - Ditto. (clinging) (gulping) - Herb, hold my hand. Now, look into my eyes. And tell me that you love me and that you, you can't live without me, and that my lips are like ripe cherries and my eyes are like pools of cool water that you just wanna float in, and that your thighs tingle helplessly from the love that gushes up from the bottom of your soul. - Consider it said. - Herb, I know I can say it, the whole point is that I want you to say it. - What's the difference who said it? You said it and I conquered. - Dance with me Herb? - Please Sally, I'm worn out, I'm really worn out. - Just one dance, Herb, please. (singing) Hold me tighter Herb. (singing) Now twirl me around. (singing) Now dip me Herb dip me. Now say all those things to me that you conquered with. - Well, I like to kiss your lips that are like cherries of happiness and the water in your eyes is making my thighs tingle and I'm going wild in your wilderness, how's that? - Well, it isn't that the words are wrong, it's the emotion, try it, try it once more, with passion. - Oh baby, I'm mad about you. Just looking in your eyes drives me nuts. I wanna keep the cherries right off of your lips. You make my heart go bananas. You make me feel, I feel, I feel, like I'm going crazy. You're making me crazy Sally. I know I should have never come on this trip. Back in Cleveland everything was beautiful for 24 years. Then you had to spoil what we had together with your romance. - Okay Herb, you win. Maybe I am expecting to much, I came to Rome wanting a total experience, but I will be just like you. - Now you're making sense. - Only don't wake me when the food comes. As a matter of fact, don't wake me for the next four weeks. I don't wanna spoil what we had in Cleveland either. What we had in Cleveland? What we had in Cleveland? What did we have Herb? The only romance we had in Cleveland was when you made love to me on Saturday nights. - Made love? Is that what you call what we did on Saturday night? - Well just what do you mean by that? - Look, I don't wanna hurt your feelings Sally, but you're the one who wants honesty. So don't take this personal, you want a total experience, we never even had a semi total experience, it's been zilch Sally. How do you go from zilch to total? And as far as making love, how can I make love when all the time I feel that you're mad at me? - Well, of course I was mad at you, because of the way your treated me. You treated me like zilch. You know I gave up a successful career to marry you. - You were a screw counter in a hardware store. - I was learning the business, but you wanted me home, so I let you be the one to go out and have all the fun. - I had all the fun? Do you think what I've been doing in my business for the last 24 years has been fun? I've been killing myself to support you and three kids. To put food on the table. You know, the bamboo furniture business is a cutthroat business. The only way I could beat the competition was staying up all night and pause with clients. Demeaning myself by doing Peter Lorre impersonation. I leave the office, I have chest pains, I come home at night, open the door, you hit me with your needs and I get back pains. I got it going, coming. In the office I have chest pains and at home I have back pains. And do you know why? - Why? - Because everybody has needs but me. I have no needs. Except one. To stuff my body with food. So I can forget my problems. I'm fat! I'm fat! And every pound I put on you put down. Hello, this is 5E. Call room service and tell 'em to add a double portion of Alfredo fettuccine to my order. Thank you. Are you satisfied? You did it again. - Oh, you're hilarious. Absolutely hilarious. You're telling me you never had any fun with me? Well while you were stuffing yourself, I was starving emotionally. I'm gonna tell you a big secret Herb, in Cleveland there are three men I see during the day who keep me from going crazy. Because they give me what I don't get from you. - I don't believe you. - Okay, you want names? Number one, Lou Fargazi. That's right, the butcher. And you know why? He holds up a rib roast, and we both admire it. We share things Herb. Number two. Andre Mulante, our decorator, remember? For two years, Andre and I combed every fabric house in Cleveland, looking for just the right Bindo material for the downstairs powder rooms. That's two years Herb, of feeling fabrics together. And number three, Stew Birjman, our family doctor, because he worries about me, when I'm run down, he gives me a vitamin B shot, and he says, how are you feeling today angel? He calls me angel. And these three men get me through the day Herb. And at night, I cry my eyes out while you're out doing your terrible Peter Lorre impersonation. - Do you mean that you don't like, my impersonation of Peter Lorre? - It stinks Herb. - Then our whole marriage is based on a lie. (doorbell ringing) Come in. - Good evening, shall I server the dinner senior? - Just put it over there. Hey, wait a minute. You go to the movies? - Oh, si. - Who is this? Did you get the information Mister Miller? You didn't get the information Mister Miller? You were supposed to get the information Mister Miller. - Jean Laloloprijita. - Get out. - The truth hurts, doesn't it Herb? And how dare you tell me there was no room for your needs, you don't even know what your needs are. - I don't know what my needs are? Alright Sally, for the first time in 24 years, I'll tell you what my needs are. I need another woman! I need pleasure. I could run right downstairs now and grab the first woman I see. And now that I know what my needs are, Rome is never gonna be the same again. Alright all you beautiful Bimbos, Herb Walbert is in town, and he knows what he needs, I didn't come to pray Caesar, I came to say hello to a sister. - Oh yeah, hey friends, Romans, countrymen, you wanna see a pleasure object? Well you see this, you see this bundle of pleasure 128 pounds of joy, I'm in room 5E. - Would you get out of there Sally. - Hello sailor, what's your name? My name's Sally but my friends call me hot stuff. (whistling) - You get away from here and stop doing that. And you better not come up here sailor, she's a married woman with three kids, and I'm an admiral. - I'm a pleasure object. - She's 45, and in two months, she'll be a grandmother. You hear that, a grandmother. Whoa, go ahead. - You don't think I'd dare, huh? - Let me have it. - Let you have it huh? - Let me have it! - You're waiting for it? - Yes. - Okay. I wouldn't give you the satisfaction. - What the hell are we doing? - I don't know Herb. I guess that's it, when two people wanna dump spaghetti on each other's heads, there's nothing left but divorce. - You said it, I didn't. (sniffling) - You can have the business, I, I just want the house. - Fair enough. You can have the station wagon I'll take the sedan. No. - What do you mean no? - I mean no. I'm not gonna give up the house. And I'm not gonna give up the station wagon and the sedan, I worked too hard to get those things. Most of all, I'm not gonna give up you. Because you worked too hard to give us a wonderful life together. After all, What's the matter with it. A pretty woman like you, as alive as you, wanting a little romance. What's wrong with romance? Romance helped us to fall in love and get married. Romance gave us three wonderful kids. Sally, if it was beautiful back in Cleveland, how much more beautiful it can be here? We're in Rome. One of the world's most romantic cities. A little while ago you made a toast. Now I wanna make one. To you, Sally. The most desirable woman. (clinging) - I love you Herb, I love you very very much. - What a nice fin. (soft music) - Good afternoon. Don't worry, your eyes will get used to is in a few moments. If we made it any lighter we'd lose half our clientele. Can I help you? - Oh, no, no, it's alright, I'm supposed to meet a friend here but I'll find him. - Oh, there's someone sitting in the back who's expecting a blonde, would you like me to take you to the table? - Oh no, no, no, no, no, I'll find it myself thank you. Very nice of you. - [Woman] I feel so guilty meeting you like this darling. - [Man] I'm only alive when I'm with you angel. - [Woman] We've got to get away more often sugar plum. - [Man] My wife watches every move I make lamb chop. - Pussycat, psst, pussycat, over here. - Teddy bear, is that you? - Yes, sit down quick pussycat before somebody sees you. - Boy, I've been worried sick that your wife wouldn't let you out of the house Fred. - Fred? What do you mean Fred? - Aren't you Fred Schneider? - No, I thought you were Marie Rednick. - Oh my God, this is embarrassing. I'm sorry, excuse me. Please don't mention this to anybody. - Of course not. - Because I'm not the kind of person who-- - Neither am I. - Fred? Fred? - Psst, Pussycat. - Fred is that you? - Come over here. - Who's that woman. - I don't know, some dame by the name of Mary Rednick. - Oh, Ms Rednick, your teddy bear is over there. Oh Fred, it suddenly seems so tacky meeting here like this. - Tacky? How can you call this beautiful, sacred thing we have together tacky? - Fred, I just can't believe I'm sitting here with my best friend Marna's husband and cookies tip toe in. - Well how do you think I feel? Harry's my second cousin. - Oh Fred, Fred I wish I could fight the feeling but I'm only alive when I'm with you. I'm dead at the supermarket, I'm dead at the PTA, I'm dead at the beauty parlor. - You think you're dead. I'm dead at the bank, I'm dead at the little league games. - Are you dead with Marna? - Of course I'm dead with Marna. Why, aren't you dead with Harry? - You know I'm dead with Harry. I live only for you, you're my life, my heart, you're my reason for breathing. - You're my moon, you're my stars, you're the reason for my jogging. - Oh, I love the touch of your aftershave, the sound of your hair when it moves. - And I love the smell of your Boa. - You know, I have absolutely nothing in common with Harry. We've been married 20 years but we have nothing to talk about. You're different. We have so many things to talk about. When we're going to see each other, how much time we have together, what excuses we're going to use to get out of the house. Oooh, I could go on and on. - You know, before I met you, I was just a successful banker I just didn't know who I was. And it wasn't until that night, that I went to Jake Powell's party and grab you in the tool shed, suddenly I realised who I was, Fred N. Schneider. - You think you didn't know who you were. I was just a homemaker, but now, I'm Rita Fledgman, and I only live for my togetherness with you but Fred, it's just not enough anymore. 20 minutes of togetherness here, 10 minutes of togetherness there, I can't go on like this, I'll die if I don't get more togetherness. - You're right, you're right. We gotta spend a whole weekend together. How about Labor Day? - Oh no good. How's Columbus Day? - Can't make it. - Well, than the only other possible day is Veteran's Day. - I'd love to but I, I'm marching. - You'd rather march than go away with me? - I can cheat on my wife, but not the national guard. - Well, then there's only one thing left for us. You've got to tell Marna, and I've got to tell Harry. - About what? - About us, and how we're alive together and dead with them. - Are you crazy? That would hurt Harry and Marna. I don't wanna hurt Harry and Marna. You wanna hurt Harry and Marna? - Oh course I don't wanna hurt Harry and Marna. It would hurt me to hurt Harry and Marna. - We can't hurt Harry and Marna, we'd only be hurting ourselves. - Well, then it's all over Fred. I just can't take this anymore, we can't ever see each other again. Let's discuss it. - When? - Thursday. - Where? - Tony's Hideaway. - What time? - Six minutes to five. - Wear your aftershave. (soft music) (soft jazz music) - [Maureen] Mother, I'm doing it and that's that. - [Pauline] Maureen, just wait until your father hears about this, he'll go crazy. - [Alfred] For once in my life I'm doing what I want. - [Pauline] Well you just wait out for until your father hears about this. When he hears, he'll kill you. (sniffling) - Alright Pauline, what is it? - It's nothing Mike, you relax and have your drink. - What is it Pauline? - Please Mike, I don't want you to get upset on New Year's Eve, so don't keep asking me. Alfred Broke up with Betty Dorcy and now he wants to go out tonight looking for other girls. And Steven Dolmarini, he's sick of spending New Year's Eve at our house. Mike, if you don't do something quick, your daughter's gonna be out tonight clubbing with Steven and a bunch of strange drunks and your son will be cruising down Foster Avenue asking filth to get in his car, and you and I will be left alone on New Year's Eve, eating four pounds of cold cuts. - Ah, Pauline, will you calm down? The kids have a right to their own viewpoints. And I'm anxious to hear them. Then we'll work it out so everybody's happy. (crying) - It's alright Mike. Alfred, Maureen, you get down here right this second, your father's absolutely furious, and he wants to hear your viewpoints, before he breaks both your heads. Oh your father is so mad at you, I don't know if I can control him, he is so mad. - Alright, now I'd like to start off this little discussion by reaffirming what you already know about me. I'm tough and I'm grumpy, but I also am pig headed in fact. Am I right Alfred? Right Maureen? Right Pauline? - Well, sometimes-- - Right Pauline? Alright, now your mother here on my left, has brought to my attention your viewpoints. But she's done so in an emotional and a hysterical manner, which we all know is caused by her femineity. Right Alfred? Right Maureen? So, what I'd like to say-- - What about me, Mike? - Am I right Pauline? On the other hand, I like to approach things more in a in a manly way, which is due to my masculinity. Now you can ask any of my best friends. Jonny Bridges, Georgy Shry, Tommy Ritzo, Eddie Cunz, Leppy Brian, and they'll tell you, that whenever, whenever I got into a situation with them, I always listened to their viewpoints, and made sure that I had all of that before I punched each one of them up. That must be the goal I live by. Logic and then violence. So I'm going to ask you two the same question that I ask them, whenever there's a problem. What the hell is going on here? - For three years, Steven's had to sit through our boring New Year's Eve parties, and we're through being prisoners here. I want thrills and excitement this New Year's Eve. I'm going out. - Well, Alfred. - Look, I feel bad that I broke up with Betty Dorcy, I wanna go out with my friends and really cut loose. I'm 18, I have a right to get stink and drunk and pass out. - You want thrills and excitements? You want all hell breaking loose? Well I'll put on my high pumps and jump up and down on your faces. (all yelling) - Hold it! Hold it. Now let me see if I have your viewpoints correct. You've both decided that you wanna break a two generation president, and not spend New Year's Eve with the two people who love you most, because it's boring, am I right Alfred? - That's right? - Am I right Maureen? - Right. - What should we do Mike? What should we do? - Well, knowing the situation, and having mauled through all of that, thoroughly, I'd like to express my viewpoint. Nobody's going anywhere! No how! No way! No chance! The case is dismissed! Through! Finished! Done! - Now that's fair, your father's very fair. - Fair? How is that fair? - Look, since you've been born, you've been with us every New Year's Eve at 12 o'clock, listening to Guy Lombardo, and watching the little ball go down in Times Square. And wishing each other a happy new year. Also, watching your mother and I dance to Apple Blossom Time. It's a tradition. - And as long as we're alive, you will be with us on New Year's Eve. - You wanna go out on New Year's Eve? You'll wait till we're dead. - And we don't mean just incapacitated, we mean really dead. - That'll give you something to look forward to. - Oh, this is ridiculous, I am a grown woman! Steven loves me and wants to be alone with me. - To do what? - Anything he can do with you in a nightclub, he can do with you right her in front of us. - Unless it's grab your knee while you're eating, or blow in your ear while you're dancing. I happen to know all about that, I was young. I did that with plenty of women. - Your father did that with plenty of women. - Why do you think I married your mother? - Why do you think he married me? - Because she wouldn't let me do that to her. - Your father never blew in my ear. - And I've never felt that I've missed out on anything either. - I am sick and tired of you making me feel guilty, I am going out with Steven tonight, and if he blows in my ear, I'm gonna blow right back in his. - You don't have to know this miss woman of the world, miss smarty hot pants, but if you become a loose woman, there's not a man in this town with a sought that will marry you. - Steven wants to marry me, he proposed today and I accepted. - What? - What? - We weren't gonna tell you until after New Year's, because we wanted it to be our secret, but this is a crazy house, this could have been the happiest night of my life, but you've ruined it and I'm miserable. Happy New Year. (crying) - Oh, I'm sorry baby, but it was such a big shock both you and Alfred wanting to leave us alone tonight, and it was an even bigger shock that you wanna get married. - It's alright mom, I understand, I love you. - Honey, Steven's a wonderful boy, but, I feel bad because you and I have never really discussed marriage the way a mother and daughter should. You see Maureen, there are, there are certain things that I have learned through the years with your father about, how to make a beautiful marriage. Make sure, that your sex life grows more exciting every year. Learn to kiss with the lights on. And let him see you in your slip from time to time. And gradually you will get to the point where you can sit in the bathtub and bare your whole body, while he's still in the house. Am I embarrassing you baby? - Not yet mom. - Maureen, there's something that you're old enough to know about, not too long after your father and I got married, my sister Winny told me that she saw your father put his arm around a waitress where he was working. Well, I, I didn't wanna do anything rash, so I, I asked St Theresa for guidance. You know, she's the one to pray to, any problems involving suspected smut. And we decided that I should keep calm, and when your father came home I would see with the way he behaved whether he was innocent or guilty. Now, if he was is usual grumpy self, he'd be innocent, but, if he had a smile of inner peace, then he'd be guilty. In which case we would sit down at the table like rational people and I would tell him he must never do this obscene thing again. - Well, what happened? - When? - When daddy came home, was he grumpy or did he have a smile? - Oh, I don't remember, because the minute he opened that door a picked up a frying pan and hit him on the head with it. So you see baby, marriage does have its problems. But, what makes it all worthwhile are the wonderful things you get in return, like, a companion, to share your loneliness with, and most important, you must hang on to your traditions, because, they, they give order to your life. You see, that's why I look forward to dancing to Apple Blossom Time with your father every New Year's Eve. - Mom, what made you and daddy pick Apple Blossom Time as part of your tradition? - Well, I will tell you the whole romantic story. One day, when we were first married, we were at a party and I asked your father to dance, and he said no, and Eddie Davis, a man who always kinda liked me said I'll dance with you Pauline. And Apple Blossom Time was playing and we started dancing. Later, walking home, your father said he was mad, really mad, that I had danced with Eddie Davis, and I said, I asked you and you turned me down. And your father went crazy with jealousy. He called me a wicked vamp, and then I smacked him in the face and then he banged me up against a tree, and then I started pulling his hair out, and then he twisted my arm and made my arm black and blue. Well, anyway, your father must have felt real bad about what he did because, that New Year's Eve, he walked in with a record of Apple Blossom Time. Every New Year's since then, we dance to that same song. Because, it's your father's way of begging forgiveness, for making my arm black and blue. (exhaling) I love that quality in a man, it's one in a million. - Mother, I really appreciate the advice, but Steven and I are going to have a different kind of marriage. - Oh. - Yes, we've worked it all out. For instance, I told him that I loved his mustache and he vowed he would never shave it off. And we both have the same taste in luggage, and end tables and leisure wear. Our favorite color is magenta. And we both love run rays and ice cream. We both want an english tutor house while he's in dental school. And a french chateau when he goes into practice, so you see mother, we've anticipated everything that could possibly come up in a marriage. - Oh, yeah. Maureen baby, where are you and Steven going to get the money to buy an English Tutor house while he's in dental school? Oh, well, now don't worry about it angel go out and enjoy yourself, this is a night for blowing up balloons, not bursting them. You do your go to get dressed. (soft music) - We are now going to have a little man to man talk. Why did you dump Betty Dorcy? - She started putting pressure on me to get married. - Pressure? Is she pregnant? - No. Pop, nothing like that. - Then what do you mean by pressure? - Her mother was fixing up an apartment over her garage, she assumed that Betty and I would get married and live there. - Now that's really stupid. You should've told her you're a man and you're gonna live where you want. And you wanna live over my garage. - Pop, I'm 18, I got a lot of years before I wanna get married. - I happen to know and understand all about the wild oat sawing you gotta do. I know that you wanna get yourself a loose woman. Before you find a good woman to marry. - What do you consider the difference between a loose woman and a good woman? - Well, the difference is that a loose woman lets you have a good time, then she goes on her merry way. Where as a good woman, let's you have a good time, but you never hear the end of it. (chuckling) hey, I got an idea, after you graduate college, I'll fix up an apartment over that garage, and it can be your own swinging batchelor pad. - Something I wanna get off my chest. I've decided to quit college and get my own apartment. - What are you talking about, quit college? You're an A student, you can't quit college. - Pop, I like chemical engineering, but it's too easy. I wanna do something where I can use more of my intellect. That's why I wanna be nightclub comic. - You wanna be a what? - I know, show business is a tough field to crack, but, Pop, I think I got great raw talent. Listen to this. Good evening ladies and germs. I just checked into a hotel, where the rooms are so small that the mice have hunched backs. Take my wife please. I mean, eventually, I'll need writers Pop, but you can see the raw talent is there, can't you Pop? Pop? Say something. I need you to be behind me, 'cause, if I don't do this now, I might always regret that I never took a chance. I mean, you see my raw talent Pop. - I could see something raw, and I can understand you need to have something raw like that, but I'm disappointed Alfred. I'm extremely disappointed. The only reason I wanted you to get a college degree is because I never had the chance to get one. But I'm your father. And though I may not agree with what you say, I'll fight to the death for your right to make an ass of yourself. - See, thanks Pop. I was so frightened to tell ya. I thought you'd go through the roof. Well I guess I better get going. - Oh, wait a minute, before you go out, you know that joke you tell, take my wife? Well if you'd get a little pause in that before you say please, they'd really get the joke, you know? - Oh you mean like this. Take my wife please. - Yeah, that's perfect, just perfect. - Thanks Pop. (car honking) - Oh, there's Steven. Just a minute Steven, I'll be right out. - She'll be right out Steven. - Bye Daddy. - Bye Sweetheart. - I love you and have a Happy New Year. - I love you too, Happy New Year to you. - Have a wonderful time darling and don't give us a second thought. - Happy New Year Pop. - Happy New Year son. - Happy New Year son. - Happy New Year mom. - Have a good time. - Happy New Year, Happy New Year Steve! - Happy New Year everybody. (soft piano music) We've got to let the birds leave the nest Mike. - Fish gotta have room to swim. - Change is part of the four seasons. - When you gotta go, you gotta go. - Kids have to make their own mistakes. - After all, we did. - We've had our share of good times too Mike. - Yeah, remember that great pot roast you made last week? - Yes, but you brought home a good piece of meat Mike. - Oh yeah. - Remember the first time we took the kids to see Santa Claus? - Yeah, that was really fun. - It's like a dream Mike. It's like a dream. - [Man On TV] And now, we take you to Times Square. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year Mike. - Happy New Year Pauline. (festive music) (soft jazz music)
