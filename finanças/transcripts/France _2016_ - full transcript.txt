I'm hitting the French roads. From the North to the South, from Charleville-Mézière to Nice... from Sète to Cherbourg. I'll stop by some houses, some shops, some City Hall squares. I'm going to met the French people, hear them talk. About what? I don't know yet. I won't ask any question. I'll let them take their time, record their conversations, their accents, and their way of speaking. I arranged an old caravan, put my camera inside it, installed some micros. Now I'm inviting people, people I had just met a few minutes earlier, in the street, to carry on their conversation in front of us, without any imposition, freely. Here we are. La Rochelle Boulevard. This is Bar-Le-Duc's Champs-Elysées. This is the Concorde Square. The Reggio Square is the Concorde Square. - That's true. - Otherwise... The Red Cross used to be here. I don't see them anymore. - Some houses are extraordinary. - The one behind you is beautiful. This is the Prefecture, it's superb. I heard that when De Gaulle came... they had to make the bed bigger. Mr. Legardeur was the Prefecture's secretary. They barely had the time. The Caisse d'Epargne is great! - It's too bad. - The ancient Caisse d'Epargne. - There are beautiful buildings. - Now it is... - You can have nice walks. - ...the Hunting Center. We'll see. This not the time yet. No. - We'll see. - Yes. We'll see where our life take us. We'll see. First, we need to know if it's a boy or a girl. - Yes. - I can't wait for it. I should have known the 16th. I told you, they made a mistake about the appointment. I think. - The 16th was a Saturday. - It was last Saturday. Yes. They work from Monday to Friday. I never had an appointment during the week-end. - I think they made a mistake. - If it was a private clinic, maybe. - But this wasn't a private hospital. - Maybe he took an appointment... - No, he didn't! The girl did it! - It was the secretary. It's weird she wasn't more careful. It happens. - Maybe she was in a rush. - But it had to be for you! That's it! It's okay. We'll have another appointment and you'll know. I want to know. So that I can by his first PSG shirt. He'll owe one before he is born! That'll be great. With his little shoes... - We'll have to start buying things. - Yes. Otherwise we'll be in trouble. Totally. If it's a boy... - I can take care of it. - Boy or girl, all the same. You'll take care of the baby anyway! You think you'll decide alone if it's a boy? No, but I mean, if it's a girl.... Well... I don't know what suits girls. Don't ask me to buy her a dress or... You can buy her sneakers. - Right. - Select the brand. Brand! Brand! Brand! That's the only word in your mouth! - Your eyes shine when you say Brand! - They have to! Double Poney! Eyes, ding ding ding! Of course. I can't put Winnie clothes on her, you know. Yeah, sure. But it'll just be a baby at the beginning. So what? Even a baby! What's the point of buying Lacoste or Guess to a baby? - She will have nice clothes. - That's all? You don't need these brands to have nice clothes. - You do. - You don't. - Do you were these brands? - So what? It's not about me. My girl is somebody else! - She is! - She's not. She will have nice clothes, but it doesn't have to be these brands. - Yes, but just sometimes. - Yes, like everybody. I'm right, you're wrong. Stop arguing! I'll always contradict you! - Don't contradict me! - I do. You mustn't stress me! I don't know. I can't wait for it. Can you? - No. - It's for different reasons. I can wait. You can and you can't at the same time! - I can't wait but... - "I can wait for the pain!" You can't wait to give birth but you can. I can't wait for the delivery to be over. - Be with him, see him walk... - Yes! See him, not the walking! Just be with him, that'd be great already. - Take him for a walk. - See him walk. - It'll take time. - Women must be in pain. It'll tell you. You'll see with my own eyes, don't worry! I used to be surprised, when Mom was still with us... the hear old people... Let's not say old. But aged, isolated persons. Whose companion was dead of had left. I used to be surprised to hear the word "solitude". I used to think, "one is always alone". Even though we have relatives. I didn't have a true comprehension of that word, "solitude". I think I wrote about that... After supper, around 10 P.M., when you are alone in your sofa, watching TV, actually zapping... bored! Then solitude hits you. I listened to a song by Léo Ferré and Juliette Gréco about solitude: "You come home in your building". "It's here, seating in the stairs, waiting for you" I remember those words, it was Léo Ferré, I think, and, now I think I know what solitude is. You can adapt, live with it. But it's even more difficult when we were so pampered by Mom. That moment comes and you have to re-learn how to live. I'll be 81 soon. Physically I'm fine, it seems. But I still learning how to live. I'm learning how to cook alone, how to go out alone... How to... anyway. You just meet men. Women are forbidden, they can not go in. The men decide which girl they are going to talk to. It's only escorting, nothing else. He may want to drink a glass of Champagne. Or take a bottle. It's not very easy. When you don't know the person, it's difficult, you know. You can't be shy, you have to be open-minded. You have to be accessible, give a good impression, you know. They can't be interested in someone who don't speak. That's it. You have to be pretty. That's part of the job. If you're ugly... You can't... work in there. But it's not an easy job. It's not something... easy. Well, there is a crisis, you know. One bottle is 130€. Everyone can't spend 130€. So that's a job that is not very easy, you know. You have, well... I wish I could do something else. If I had an offer, I think I'd do another job. You can't do this job forever. Especially nowadays. It's something that is not, well, easy. I work 2 hours a day. It's fine, you know. It's not tiring, it's not about that. I had to take that job because I have 2 children. I can't stay in the street, doing nothing for my 2 kids. You have to feed them, send them to school... And other things. So, you have to do something. But if tomorrow I have an offer for something else... I'd do that thing right away, that's for sure. Life don't always let you choose. Especially when you have children. My daughter is 4, my son is 3. It's not... it's not meaningless. Don't you want to get another job? I do. Your job, compared to mine, is secured. I'd rather work in my workshop. You sure, but compared to mine your work is secured. Tomorrow, they may tell me: "We're closing." Or: "No client." These I'm working for nothing, no clients are coming. Maybe somebody will have one glass. But a glass is nothing. That's the way it is, you know. I was talking about my children. My kids go to school so, you know... It's complicated with his father, he has the custody. It's complicated. When I want to see them I have to ask to the tribunal. I'll go to the tribunal soon. They really don't help. My job is really not great... and they ask me to pay a pension. For 2 kids! I'll have to look for another job. It can't work. I have my job on one side... and my kids on the other one. - You don't have kids, it's good. - No. It's very good. Well, I'm not saying it's good not to have kids. But I was too young. You have to think. Think, you know. - Have you heard from uncle and auntie? - Yes. They are not calling me anymore. What did they say? Anything about me? - No. - No? They are going to the North. Uncle is in Spain now. Spain? Well, life is beautiful. Beautiful. I don't hear from nobody. Even Mrs Ramakli don't call me. Why would she? Her husband died. Nobody called me. There are things like that... They don't want to hear from me. Fine. I live for myself, not for them, not for the other. Look, since I told my Mom about my job, she barely talks to me! "I don't want my daughter to do such a job." People don't have the same... They think differently. How long did she raise me? How long did we spend with that host family? 6 years. She raised... Yes, she raised me. For 6 years. Now I tell her I work in a night club. - What about you? - Me? - I'm struggling. - Why? - I don't want to talk about him. - You should. I think you'll regret him. You should have talked to him. - You think? - Why do you think he sent you a message? Yeah, but... he's a pain. He's too... He's not... I'm younger than him. But you're more mature. He can be such a brat. I can't believe it. - Maybe that's why you like him. - Yeah. You know he's a clown and makes you laugh. Still, he can say shit sometimes. But you're here... That's how love is. Fuck. - You think you're better? - We're done. - Really? - Over. When was the last time you saw him? 3 weeks ago. - Do you think of him? - Yes. Really? Every day? Maybe not everyday. I don't when I go out. - But in the evening... - Evening are long! - I'm like... - "What is he doing now?" Yeah! And "Asshole"! That's true! - Does he text you? - I changed my phone number. - That's true. - That was the point. I blocked him on Facebook. - You had to. - I was still receiving his letters. - I burnt them! - Good. There were papers from the employment agency. I burnt everything. "No, I got no letter." He is such a jerk. He messed up with me, I'll mess up with him. - I won't let him do that. - This summer will be... This will be a turbulent summer. I'm sure you'll meet someone. I told it to Julie. - Who? - I dunno. I just feel it. Someday you'll come with us to a nightclub! The guys will be like... - I don't want that. - No! Why? So, what are you going to do after that? - After? - Yeah. I'll go home. I'll go home pick up my stuff. - I had a fight with my mother. - Yeah, you told me. I have to pick up my stuff. I don't know things will go. I don't know how things will go. - This city is making me crazy. - I can come with you. Come with me if you want, come. So it will... If your mother see me, maybe she won't dare... Let's do this. Not my mother, but more my father. - Really? - Yeah. - My father is... - He's better? You're better with your father? My father doesn't care about anything. Really? As you want. I have stuff to pick up. I try to go home when my mother is here. My father will never let me go in. And even if he does... It will be tough, you know. If there are the two of them, you'll take my stuff. Then I'll go. Yeah. Be careful in Fréthun. Fréthun is worse than Calais. So many assholes! Yeah, just like here! You can find a bunch a nice people here. I never forbade you. You never asked me. Every time I want to go, you say no. - It's jealousy. - You make a long face. When you want to go with your girlfriends, I just let you go. But you're as jealous as me. - Yes, but. - It has to be reciprocal. When I go to cafe you always spy on me. It's jealousy. I could do the same, when my friends are here and you're the only girl... - Be jealous. - Yes, I know. Anyway, let's not... It's annoying. What can I do? That's my nature. That's my temper. You know that already, we've been together for 3 years. I know, but it would be nice to put some distance. It was nice when you were still working. We had little breaks. We were happy to see each other in the evening. It's different know. - It's a bit complicated. - Yes. I'm not saying you can't go out with your friends. You can. Have fun. We're not breaking up for a party. I hope so. - We'll have to try. - Yes. - Okay? - Yes. - I love you. - I love you too. - Are you going to fish tonight? - Yes. - With who? - Some friends. We'll see what we'll do. - I'll go home at 3 or 4 A.M. - Okay. - You have your stuff? - Yes. Good. I hope you will catch fish! - I hope so too. - Me too. My daughters are not here. At least yours... I have my daughter and my grand-daughter here. I take her to school everyday. My daughter came to visit my sister. She called me: "I'm waiting for you here." My house was very close, but she wouldn't visit me. My grand-daughter, Zoé, she's walking. I never see her. I heard she's difficult. Maybe I'll see here someday. I take mine everyday to school. You're so lucky. I wish she would have lunch with me. She always lunch with me. Every day, my grand-daughter is with us. The last time was when you all came for my birthday. I ate with my two daughters. When one comes the other one is not here. Well, it saddens me a bit. Yes. - But they work. - That's life. People are more and more distant. We used to live with our family, with our neighborhood. The neighborhood was our family. And we could go home to our family. We'd go out of the neighborhood, out of Sète. - Out of the neighborhood... - To the city! - We'd go downtown. - We'd go downtown. - Yes, we'd go downtown. - Time flies. The 3 of us would drive our cars like racers! My father, well both of my parents, were very cool about that. One day I crashed the car in the undertaker's. My father... We could go home at 3 or 4 A.M, my mother was always at the window. As soon as she saw me, she would go in. - When I came in, she was in bed. - She was waiting for you. Luckily, our parents were here. We had good reference points. The reference points, today... The youngsters, today, I don't know... - How long has it been? - 1 month. What did he tell you? I saw him at the supermarket. He told me... He told me: "Fatima, I love her!" But I'm lost. I always I tell him: "Karim, you have to make a choice". - He's not serious. - That's it. He can't get engaged. Still he said: "Fatima, I can't live without you." Yes, but a single mother with two children... It's frightening, you know. Then why do he call you, visit you? I don't get it. Don't let him... No... Yes... Maybe he wanted it at the beginning. But then he realized the responsibility it was. I don't know. You should... I told him I'm not looking for a father. The kids have one. Have you forgotten him or are you still in love? I'm in love. Fatima, don't make that mistake. Baby... I so in love with him! - You shouldn't. - I love him. - How long has it been? A year? - It's been a year. You think you're a couple? He only considers you as his... "toy". But I love him. Maybe he'll finally realize I exist. You know? Yes, but, Baby... It's been a year! You'll be 35 in August. You have to put your life in order now! Yes, but look... - The divorce was difficult. - I know. It was 11 years of my life. I don't regret it. I had 2 beautiful children with him. Being beaten up for 11 years, you don't regret anything? Sorry. - But, at some point, 11 years... - I disagree. It's not a matter of... It's not a matter of of submission. It's about... the children! You weren't submissive, but you were beaten up! - True or false? - True. - Did you hide it? - Yes. You hide it about Karim, too. - Look, it's been 11 years now. - Finally you told me. You can't just say to people you've been beaten up. Because you already feel vulnerable. - I know, I went through it too. - You feel dirty. Tell it to other people, they will answer: "Why doesn't she just leave?" If you don't experience it... You can't live because you love him. You keep hoping he'll change. Yes, but at some point you have to... We're like sisters. Unfortunately, you keep thinking it's your fault. Always. "It's my fault he hit me, I pushed him to his limit." But at some point it has to stop. You lived it for 11 years, it's not nothing. Karim now, one year. The guy just pops in in the middle of the night, go back home right after... You don't hear from him for a whole week. You're gonna be 35 and you have 2 children. At some point... Well, no. - But I love him. - I know you love him. But override that. Be strong. It's was hard for me. You know it, Fatima. I know. I lost 60 kg. - Yes. - Yes, 60 kg. - I know it was difficult, but look... - I went through hell. When you go up the Promenade Des Anglais, do you see the Agriculture Center? - Yes, yes. - There is the cube... Then you turn to Magnan, but before you enter Magnan... You go up the hills and you arrive at the Crémat castle. Yesterday, the lightning was stunning! You could see all the landscape. With a wonderful lightning. And the sea on the other side. This is a fantastic region. It is fantastic. On top of that, the city keeps getting more and more beautiful. It's so agreeable to live here. We have everything. It's more than agreeable for us retired people. Yes, there is everything a senior needs. Absolutely everything. Conferences, courses... Let's be honest. This city is really... - Every morning is sunny! - And bright! I've been here for 40 years. I'll never leave. What is bothering you here. What? Everything. The mentality! The mentality, everything. The routine. It's too hard here. It's the same everywhere. Paris is not easy either. There are more things you can do there. It's polluted. The city is too big. See, when we visit you we can't go out, we can't... When we visit you, it's no fun to us. I know. But I'm used to live in Paris now. If you weren't here, I wouldn't... I wouldn't come here so often. In Nice. Your my only link to Nice. Apart from you... Nice... It's a nice city. I grew up here. But I'm used to Paris now. And it's easier for my job. Paris is better to develop my brand. I can't stay here. But I often think of it. I miss you. But... When you retire you can visit me more often. Yes. - Don't you want to marry? Don't you want to... - Of course I do. I do. It's a project. - Yes? - But I can't marry before... Before I stabilize myself. Before my situation... is more stable. - Yes? - Yes. I can't. "Marriage" is a big word. It's not... - It's not. - It is. I can't marry before I have a stable situation. You know, a lot of people marry before... they don't... They have a little job and that's all. That's not your case. It's not my goal. You can marry, have children... I'll have grand-children there. I know, but... It's a project that is not for now. Yeah, always the same thing. We speak, we speak... Don't be in a rush. You have 2 grand-children already. But there are far away. I barely see them. Once a year, at most. I wish I could spend more time with them. - Yes. - What can I do? - Don't you start crying! - I won't cry. I won't, but... I just mean to tell you we feel a void. We feel it. Of course, when your 2 children leave it has to be tough. We feel it. We feel like... we do not exist. Hey, don't go too far. I don't. I assure you. You and your sister, you... - I know. - We miss you. We miss you too. But we have to... We feel useless. We work and go home. But it has always been like this. We have the feeling that... That... I don't know. To be useless. - Don't say that. - I assure you it's true. That's total nonsense. As soon as I sat down... She's a beauty. Physically perfect and stuff. As soon as I got a girlfriend, all the girls were around me. - It's a classic! - I hated that! - When you're single and looking for a girl... - Nobody's here! Nobody! - But when you have a girlfriend... - All the girls of Nice are after you. But you can't accept, because of your girlfriend! When you are single again, you can't find any. They mean it! They do it on purpose. I think so. I think they call each other. They are like: "Talk to him and tell me what he said." - They are mean. - That's the girls! - Imagine it's true. - Your girlfriend! When she will never admit it's a plot. You remember the little blond we both fucked? The one who lived near the school? She even prettier today! We did it in the tech lab, do you remember? Mr Ménardin. - Every time... - Not her. The little blond! The blond? My ex? - Is she your ex? - Don't you remember? - You was with her? - Of course! - I forgot that. - The little blond. Even my brother hooked her up. I swear! - He... - No, no. - She's clean, nice. - Really? She's not that kind of girl. But the other one, she was... She was... She was a lion! - The whole school fucked her! - She was such a bitch, bro! Yeah, true. Well. They do what they want with their body. - Mine is clean. - I don't touch such girls. Neither do I. Sometimes I hook up girls but not with that kind. It was the ancient time. We were so hungry! So hungry, yeah! France was the worst. Top of the top. I will never forget that girl. 3 in a row! Do you remember Laurent? 2 seconds! I had forgotten! We all lasted 5, 10 minutes. Not too long. He won. He was the champion. He went in. I looked away. I looked back. - He was done. - A champion! What did he said? "It was not good, it was bad." So how did he manage? And France is not a top model! She was the worst of the class! That girl... we traumatized her! I don't get it. After all the things we did to her! And the day she wanted to denounce us to Damek! - I wanted to kill her. - If she hadn't been a girl... I'd have hit her like a man. But after that, she... Yeah, that was cool, very cool. Yeah, it's was nice. Yeah. - It's not easy. - Yes, it's difficult. It's tough. It's not tough, it's a war! All of a sudden you end up with someone you've never been with. Maybe you saw him somewhere, but it's different. When a man lives with you, he looks at you differently. You become an object. - He owes you. - He owes you. You're his maid. You're... his sex toy. That's what we call that. In the end... you sit down all alone in your house. And you think: "I dreamt of this, but I should have..." Do that later. - Yes, later. And also... - Do a test. Do a test, yes. Living with a man, you have to deal with all his vices. - Yes, it's hard. - It's hard, it is hard. Still you have to keep pretending in front of the people. But when you are alone with... your lover and your child... It's not easy. My neighbors often knock on the door. "Could you stop fighting, please? It's over midnight." Also, do you know what... This is something I really must tell you. I think Facebook... It ruins a couple's life. It's incredible. When he come back from work, the first thing is does... His phone. Facebook. Girls on Facebook. I like her pictures. I invite her as a friend. I talk to her. But I never mention I have a child and I live with my girlfriend. Sometimes I look at what he writes. I stalk him. Sometimes his conversations hurt me. I don't tell him, because I sneaked. "You know, I live at my friend's." "I have one child but I'm single." Meanwhile you're cleaning the house and cooking the meal. It's like in the movies. "Oh, darling! I go to work!" With a bunch of flowers! - Flowers! - And a love letter! The love letter. "I went to the grocery, I'll be back soon. Love." I don't know that. But I know: "What do you cook for diner? - "What did you prepare?" - It's so different. - It's real life. - You have to hold on. - My fairy tale didn't last very long. Love stories don't exist. Anyway, they said Allah is... in omniscient. Also... What? What was the phrase? - He is forgiving and... - Merciful. And omniscient. So... This is what I like with this religion. At least... I don't know how it is for the Catholics. Because we never really read it, actually. No, we don't have to spend hours on that topic. To each his religion, to each his belief. - Everyone is free. - But I wanted to know. The thing, when they say... that Catho shouldn't eat pork. - It's written in the Bible. - So why did you say yesterday... I said: "Impossible!" It's because I think Muslims are more devoted to their religion. Yes. But there is something written like it was... You know, the 2 first lines in blue. Like it's soiled and stuff. It's soiled, pork is soiled. In the Bible. But they say its not forbidden to eat some. Because the Bible... I think, I'm not sure... I heard that the Bible, the Pope... He can change it. The Bible is changing. The text changes, when the Pope feels like it. Because it doesn't fit with our time. Whereas the Koran, it's arrived 1435 years ago... on Earth. It never changed. That's why we see things... weird things. They can not be contextualized because it's been 1435 years that the Koran was written. Things happen in 1435 years. The restriction is I can choose the specialty without choosing the city. If I'm affected to Marseille, Lille or Strasbourg... I think I'll go. My career needs it. That's the job I'll do for the rest of my life. Yes. 4 years of residential school will be quick. I have no... I have no husband, no kids, no ties. There is only you. But you'll understand if I have to go far. - You know it won't be because... - Marriage is sacred too. You have to think about it. Life is not only about studying. You know, it's important for us to see you with someone. This is not planned yet. - Still, we have to talk about it. - Yes. Destiny will determine my life. You can't do everything. I know. But, I don't know... Maybe you are hiding someone from me. Well, yes. You are almost done... studying, bookworming... Now you also have to... build your private life. It's important. - Yes. - Yes! Have kids. A little girl and a little boy, so sweet! I'm 25, I have time. Yes. You'll have to take that time. Yes, You'll have to think about it. Don't speak only about studying. Anyway, I'll be very happy the day you arrive... "Mom, you know..." I will be... That's the way it is. Mother like their daughters... blooming. First, it was your studies. You have done your best already. Now... it's the way it is. That's life, that's life. - Sure. - Yes. Are you worried? - Why? - Because it... I don't know. It's scary. It frightens me because... I grew up with you, in our cocoon... in a small town... Leaving the house all of a sudden... I don't know. I don't feel... ready to go, yet. Maybe I'm too young. I don't know. You know... We talked about it 50 times, Théo. Maybe you're too hurried. I don't know. I don't know. There are a lot of things! Look, 2 days ago I missed my driving license. It's bothering. I don't... I feel like... I don't know. I have no... vision, you know? Distant vision I mean. I'm a bit lost. I'll continue studying, without knowing what I'll do afterwards. - It's... - But you want everything. You want everything, quickly. So it has to... Yes, but it's frustrating. I need to learn patience. I'm impatient. I've always been. You're going too fast. - I've always been. - You're 19 now. 19! Wait. When you're 19 live only begins. You said that but when you were 19 your life was cool. Yes but you... Well... I always tell you... At 19 I had left. - Mom and Dad weren't here. - But it was easier. You didn't need diplomas. It's was easy to find a job. You don't need diplomas when you are determined to succeed. When you don't study, you have to work harder. When you don't study... You do, Théo. But I can't know how it was in your time. Can you image our life after the Baccalaureate? We will be in the adults' world. It will be weird when we'll have our own flat. It will happen all of a sudden! Imagine we go to the same College. - Do you think we'll work? - I will. - You will? - Yes. - I want to be a psychologist. - You were supposed to work this year. But this year is easy. I just need the Baccalaureate. Yes. - If you fail you'll retry next year. - No! You repeated a year twice already. Things always come in threes! - Well said, asshole! - I know. Being in the adults' world will be weird. It's scary. Yes! - It's frightening. - In a way I can't wait for it. I'm in no rush. I liked being a kid. The guy can't help being nostalgic. It's different. We're teenagers now. But we're becoming adults. - Kid, teen, adult. - It alters everything. - Fucker. - Damn! - I find it a bit confusing. - What? - Everything. - Everything? - I'm fed up. - What is it? I want the Baccalaureate to be over. - You're stressed? - I can't think of anything else. Me too. But it's all about mental. I'm a wannabe-psy, I can tell. - Sure. - I love talking to people so much! You won't be a psy. You like being helped, but not help. You harm people. I like helping! I helped Tiffany! She had a problem with her boyfriend. She said: "Thanks, you're my psy." I'm a good psy for sure. I will have a career. Psychologist! - I'll have a big office. - Like Monk. A big palace! 300.000€ for a consultation. - Psychologist for cops must be good. - For cops? Yeah. - Psychologist for cops. - What is it you want to be? - Businessman. - Businessman. Yeah. - Criticize it. - No. - No. - It's your job, you decide. I can't stand you criticizing me all the time. I'll hit you. Fuck! I'm missing the residential years. Crazy years! Best time of my life I think. So many shit we did! So few lessons we studied. Do you remember when we hit Fabien? He was on the floor. He was like: "Stop! Stop!" - "The 2 of you stop now!" - That was Michou. - Damn, yes. - We destroyed him. But... He reproaches me to... How can I say? To be here, with his children. He feels like her daughters are uncomfortable. But... I'm barely home. I'm working almost all the time. The four of us are all together only once a week. I don't understand why he wants me to leave. We barely see each other. I'm in the same situation. Maybe he's not really ready to start a new life. He wants to be with you, but not to live with you. He needs time. I'm in the middle of a divorce now. I don't want to start all over again with anybody. - But you want to meet someone. - I'm still too angry with men. I won't be homeless, I'll come to your place. I would never let you down, I told you already. But it's a nuisance. What about your divorce? I'm waiting for the verdict. I hope I'll be allowed to go back to the house. He'll have to find a new house. He'll find one. He will. He's not searching yet. He'll have to. When he sees the verdict, he'll have no other choice. He will have to. He will have no other choice. Of course I want a normal, peaceful life. You have to keep one thing in mind. As I told you, it's been... 3 days. I'm doing a great effort now. Not a real effort. I mean, I get rid of one thing 3 days ago. Something heavy that wouldn't let me sleep. And that... that... it... I'm very happy. I think I've done a lot in 3 days. So, I'm wondering. You can do the same thing. It doesn't have to... Don't even think of it. - That is no future for you. None. - No. I realize that. You have 2 ways. But when you look at it, the employment market is not motivating at all. You have to do so, behave so... I had... I was... I did... I've always been... serious. A lot of people told me. I always did the job. I'm not afraid of going to work. No problem. Bear the fact that... You have to grit your teeth. Do you think I enjoy it? I've been doing this job for 4 years. I'm giving the best I have. It doesn't pay back. So I'll quit. I'm done with it. That's it. Still, I'm not... I'm not thinking... "Oh, I'm going to do some business" or something like that. "I may ruin my life and ruin my family". - It's true that... - You're not alone, Jérôme. - I want to do this alone. - But you can't. It's too easy. You are not alone. I'm here, you're brother is here. Think about it. I know you're young, you don't want a complicated life. Actually, you have no respect for us. - Your behavior is... - It's not a matter of respect. I just don't want you to be involved. But you are involving us! You can't imagine, I'm not sleeping at night. That's what I reproach you! Not reproach, but at some point you have to... Stop worrying. Stop worrying! Because... It's true, really. I wish you'll have kids someday, then you'll understand me. We'll see if you can stop worrying. I don't think so. I wish you'll have kids. I want grand-children. But the path you're taking... Honestly, it worries me. I'm telling you. I won't lie. I want this situation to change. I'd like... It has to change. It's been a year and it can't go on like this. It's impossible. I've been patient. I have been... At first, chocked. Then I thought... "He'll react, he'll get over it." But one year later I realize it was a failure. So I thought: "I have to take care of him." "I'll have to reconsider." "He must understand that I won't let him ruin his life. No way!" It's visceral, Jérôme. I can't help it. It's... You and your brother are... Well, yesterday I was home. I cooked the diner for my kids. - Daily routine. - Daily routine. Then, well... You know, I have to take care of two kids . I'm raising them. I got divorced, you know. What did you do this week? I didn't see you at all. This week? Home, the routine. Food for my children, my daughter and my son. That's all. Well, I have a girlfriend but... - Didn't she call you? - She did! I see her every 2 days. - The problem is... - Did you tell her the joke? The joke? When you say: "I'm with Youssef and..." I did. Every time I talk about you she gets mad. It makes her crazy! - The problem is she drinks too much. - Really? - She drinks a bottle of whiskey per day. - What was her prescription? It's too bad, because I like her very much, really. I'm almost in love. But... I swear! She's a pretty woman, she's 33. But... The problem is I can't accept it. Everyday I tell her: "Stop drinking, it will kill you." - She won't. - No. She got divorced one year ago. I know, I saw her recently. Yeah, we brought her to Aurec. Do you remember the mess it was? - She made a crisis. - A crisis. She was drunk. She was like: "I don't want to see him!" She had a bottle of whiskey in her bag. She got drunk everyday. I don't know how to reason her. I dunno what to do. It's a shame. She's a pretty and sweet woman. When she's sober she's so cool! I'm telling you the truth. I don't ask everybody to come with me to Valencia. It's been 3 years we're together. You're part of my life now. I'd like you to meet... To meet, really encounter this city. - I know. - This is a part... An important part of my life. I have great memories there. Without any doubt the best memories of my childhood. Okay, but we won't always go to Spain. We'll have to change sometimes. I'm saying we'll always go to Spain. I loved Maghreb. It was very nice, last year. I'm a Mediterranean. I have no problem going... Tunisia, Morocco. It was really nice. I'd like to go there again, really. Or we could visit one European capital a year. It'd be nice too. We'll see. - But this is my project. - It'll depend on our budget. But... It's... it's up to you. Does this kind of holidays... Seduce you or not? You enjoyed Malaga last year. And we'll have to see about us too. Make things clear, sleep together. We'll have to talk about that too. Because, that is bothering. We sleep, we don't... What's the matter? I told you. Holidays is a good time to find out if we could live together. - But you... - During the holidays! But you can't sleep with someone! You always have to go! It's annoying, it's irritating! It really is annoying! You leave in the middle of the night. But I'm having trouble sleeping. Yes, yes, yes... It's complicated to sleep with someone. People move, make sounds... - It makes me nervous. - That's it! - So I like sleeping alone. - But that is annoying! You can't sleep. As soon as I move a bit... It's a catastrophe. I must be in good form in the morning. I need to rest in order to be able to work in the morning. We'll need a serious talk about that. Absolutely! A normal couple have to sleep together. You can't leave and sleep in another bed. I love the idea of each of us having his own flat. Also I work at home. If you work at home too, we'll need space. We'd need space, yes. We can't... None of us can be uneasy. Yes, about work and about jealousy. - You are very jealous. - Jealous? I'm not jealous! I just don't want to witness the parade of women and men... coming to see you for clairvoyance. But they mostly are women. I do have men, but 75% are women. You're the one arousing jealousy, talking about your feminine clients. I just don't feel like seeing who comes in and out... who... who... who is consulting. Also, it's not in my... you already know that... I don't believe in clairvoyance. You know our jobs and our educations are very different. We'll see that in 2016. My parents didn't taught me, not my father, actually my mother did a bit... They taught me to reason, not to believe. The job you're doing is already... For me... You know... - It's not the same. It's different. - We are kind of... We're... - Completely opposite. - Opposite! Actually, I wonder how we ended up together. - We are so different! - Yes. There's a big wedding. - It's nice. - Yes, indeed. It's Saturday, marriage. - And Lola? - Yes? Is she okay? You bastard! It's complicated. - We didn't talk about it. - Why? What? Since the day she... announced it, we haven't talked about it. Okay. I need to wait a bit before I can talk about it. Her thing is she is afraid of... It's funny to talk about it. She... She is afraid. Because she already had 2 abortions. She's afraid not to be able to give birth if she has a 3rd abortion. It's normal. It will be complicated. Yes, it won't be easy. But she's only 24. If she were 40, like the other one, I'd understand. But... Yeah. I told her: "You can't keep it only because..." "you're afraid not to have another one." It's not possible. As far as I'm concerned, it's not possible. We can't have a child like... - When you don't want it. - That's true. - It's hard. I'm not surprised. - It won't be possible. In due time then we'll talk about it. When we will have to. I hope... she will understand. Otherwise we'll have a clash. Not necessarily. - I can't stay with her if she wants to keep... - The baby. I'd tell her: "It's impossible for me." "You have to go." Because you don't want to... Is it because... What would be the problem? Don't you like being with her? - I do, but I'm not ready. - Yes, it's not easy. Look, she doesn't even have a driving license. Imagine I'm not here, I'm working. I have an appointment to sell an apartment. If something happens she won't be able to move. That's right. Taking the bus is fine, to go to work or... It's impossible. Also, you need money to have a child. - It's something that must be planned. - Absolutely. Yes, it's true. So I need to wait a bit. I let things going into my mind. - Then I'll tell her. - Okay. "You can't keep it just because you're afraid you won't be pregnant again." "Also, for a baby..." "you have to be ready and have a good job." - "You need a driving license." - It's... It's not a question of money. It's just that a child, you know... A child needs... one thing that I think is essential. It needs two people to be together. That's the way it has to happen. It needs love and affection. It's... Actually it's something that... A child is your life, actually. It's something that is huge. Too many people think life is easy. At the gynecologist she was like: "I dunno..." I was like: " What? Fuck..." Well it's not... You don't need to be smart. All you need is 5 days of training and you can remove asbestos. All you need to learn is how to wear your mask. There are all kinds of foreigners. There a French, there are Arabs. There are every kinds. It's not more... No, it's for everybody. Anyone can remove asbestos. Really anyone. The risks... It's been a man's work basically. Because it has always been said that... It's... Only assholes say so. Machos think they are better because they can use a sander. - "I can do it as well as you, boy." - So true! "Maybe even better!" - "You create too much dust!" - "I create no dust!" - At first I thought it was a man's job. It's not a man's job. It's just what people say. It's a job like any other one. You're here to earn a living. Not to... - A lot of women do "men's jobs" nowadays. - Yes. Most of the time, those who have diplomas don't. And most of the time "women's jobs" pays less than "men's jobs". It's a discrimination. My sister has a degree. What is Elise doing now? She's... What is it called? She's a social worker at the hospital of Nantes. - She earns 1100€ a month. - Damned! - Let me tell you... - Fuck! She has a degree and I earn 4 times more than her. I barely owe a diploma. Make carpets! So true! - No, no. - 1100€... You can't... No, you have a job. You can't have welfare. I asked for it. My yearly incomes are too high of 150€. - Shit. - I can have to welfare. - For 150€? - Over a year, yes. Did you ask a social worker? - Can't you have something else? - No. I have a long-term contract. Yes, yes, but... All I can do is ask Mathis' father for help. - That's all. - Yes, you can do that. - It'd be good. - That's something else. - He will have to respect the law. - He can't choose. But it's like declaring war, for sure. That's it. Things start to settle. It's been 11 years now. You have to tell him: "It's our son, I can't be the only one to pay." I have the same problem with Franco. He only gives me 25€ a month. For the canteen, the kindergarten and extracurricular. And I have to ask him 3 weeks before. The other day, the total was 24€90. He gave me 24€90. - What? - Kindergarten and extracurricular. - No. - I swear! He gave it to me at the school party. I told him: "You have to pay for half of it. It's 24€90 for each of us." I thought he'd give me 25€. No. I swear! - It's the same with mine. - Incredible but true. - I was with Teddy and Marjo. - But he gives me maintenance. He has to. We take turns so I can't have one. We were constantly fighting about that before, each month. No we take turns and he has to take care of him. It's still very difficult to get anything from him. Why don't you play it on your own? - Because... - To each his stuff. No, for the kindergarten and extracurricular. - He made me angry. - Take turns and pay one week each. No. I reserved it for me. I told the girl... "There may be more reservations. But it can't be on my welfare number." He never paid me, I was always the one paying. He owed me 75€. I sent him a message, 3 or 4 months ago. "You'll see with the kindergarten the days you need for the holidays." "But on your welfare." "Or your girlfriend's one. Because you're not paying and you owe me money." "That's the way it is." He went there. I pay 1€73 a day. With meal and snack at the kindergarten. Under his welfare number it's 8€ a day. She earns 1900€ a month. And the same for him. So the help from the welfare is very low. She pays 7€ a day for her daughter. He didn't make the reservation and called me. - No wonder why. - He said... - "I come from the office..." - "It's expensive!" "It's 7€ if I put it under my name." "But you never pay. I'm fed up of you not paying and owing me money." I told him: "I have no contract, I'm looking for a job." "I only have part-time jobs. Stop! I can't pay anymore." I told him: "Stop! That's the way it is now." "- But... No. How much do I owe you? - You owe me 75€." "- That much? - Yes." "I'll bring it to you and..." "Every month you'll tell me and I'll give you..." I said: "I'm telling you. Be late one more time and it's over." We'll try to get a bitch for him. It's so hot today. I'll kill him! I'm not here! I won't bring anything. He's sick, bro! You want to bring a girl to the hospital? - There are too many girls in Villeneuve. - I know. If you get him a girl, he'll die! Maybe he can't get a boner now. How will he do? Imagine we bring a girl there but he can't have a boner! It reminds me of a crazy story. I saw a friend yesterday. Know what he told me? I saw an old friend. He's from Villeneuve too. He told me, you know, in Paris, before... there was a street where boys could bring their girls... so that they'd be fucked. - They were lining up so that the girl could be fucked. One day, there was a big and strong black. He pushed everybody aside. He wanted to fuck. He chose a girl but he couldn't get hard. No, you're lying. Stop lying, stop. - He told me! - Stop lying. It's true! First, a black that can't get hard, that doesn't exist, bro. It's the pressure, man. The environment. The people around, it can be anything. I'm not blaming the guy. It's just... Maybe... The guy... When I heard that I laughed so hard. He pushed everybody! Then he couldn't get hard! You see how they dress up. They are looking for dicks. I can see it. - It's true. - In the subway! You can't be calm. You think: "That girl, I have to fuck her hard!" Yo man, every time I... Every time I get in a train... Every time I am in a train station... I have to have a boner. - Of course. - I have to! - You can't help it. - I have a boner. Yo, man! On your left, there is one. On your right, there is one. I dunno. I dunno, bro. This is just too much. You can never get focused. When I go to Châtelet, bro... The girls almost walked naked. Someday they will really do. - I think I know that girl. - Who? The one over there? The Arab. I think she was in my high school. - Her? - Yes. She's with her man. I think it's her man. It is. I think I gave her a ride. You remember my old car? I think I took her home. Did she give you her phone number? No, I don't think so. I think I didn't ask for her phone number. You know, Arabs are not my type. I like them small and white, you know. They are easy do deal with. Arabs are not. They come, start fighting for no reason, about meaningless things. Fuck them. It's easy to know this is the Ramadan: there is nobody in the street. You're right! - It'll be over in 3 weeks. - You will easily notice it. - It's too hot. - Unlike any other day... we almost only see... real Villeneuvian. We don't see many... gypsies. Or... blacks. Only those who work. Even the drunkards are not there, in the stairs! No. It's calm. Even the hobos are not here. There are no beer bottles scattered everywhere. It's clean. Clean... Don't exaggerate. For Villeneuve, it's clean. Downtown, it's absolutely not clean. I am... disgusted to see how dirty it has become. - Compared to before. - It's ugly. There is nothing. The shops are ugly. It's hidden behind the shop-windows. I don't even dare going in. - We have to go to Créteil to go shopping. - Yes, we will go. It's not like we could find something good here, by the way. It's either Thiais Village or Créteil Soleil. No other option. No option. There is nothing here. It's a shame we have to go so far. We used to have wonderful shops. Paris Street was superb. - It's all gone. - We had everything. It's not the case anymore. - Except for the market, tomorrow. - Yes, but... There are not many things in that market. There are only basic things. Anyway, that's what I'm saying. They adapted the shops to... the inhabitants of Villeneuve. When you see how the population has been changing in the 20 least years... And it's still degenerating. The shops are the spitting image of this population. Also, the problem, I think, is that since we have many Turks, Arabs... Blacks, colored people... It has brought a kind of global mistrust. You'll notice that, at the terrace of the cafe, except during the Ramadan... but most of the time... We are the only ones to speak French. Speak French, because we are French. We are the only ones. We noticed that with Isabelle the other day. All the tables were full. We were the only to speak French. So, I don't know... As Isabelle said: "I come from Portugal." "But my parents learnt me that in France, you speak French." Most of them can speak French. But when they are together, they speak their language so that we don't get it. Speaking their language at home, it's natural. It's the same with Antilleans. When they are together... They don't speak, they shout. - They speak Antillean. - Darn! It's terrifying. People from the East and Blacks... They don't speak, they shout. - You're beautiful. - You are. You make me beautiful. You are beautiful. - Too much feelings, babe. - Too much feelings, babe! Too much feelings, yeah. - What else? - When do we get married? We've planned it for September. "Naamou!" We'll be engaged in September. We'll marry... next year. It's not engagement, it's religious marriage! - I know. - Muslim marriage. Muslim marriage, I know. Anyway you won't be here. I'll be alone. With your uncles, say: "Naamou!" I'll call you and declare: "Okay, you are my wife." - I want a white dress! - I'll wear it later. No, you'll get me pregnant after that. - Bullshit. - Truth! - No! - Yes. If a kid comes, it's destiny! He comes, good. But I want the white dress before my body is distorted. - You'll wear the dress! - But I prefer earlier. - Earlier? - It's a life's choice. I told you. I know, it's an old story. I put the first ring on your hand, didn't I? This is... proposal ring! And birthday ring, too. - I'll get the right ring. - Good. - Cartier. - The one I saw. - With the huge diamond. - It's wonderful. - You're my soul mate. - You are mine too. Fill this heart! Yeah, you taught me yesterday: "Babe, fill my heart!" On Snapchat: "Fill it!" - I love you. - Me too, me too. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG corrected by robvanwely
