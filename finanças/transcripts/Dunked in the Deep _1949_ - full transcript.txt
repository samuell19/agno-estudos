[♪] MAN: Authorities admit that secret files, recently stolen, are still missing. A hot suspect is being sought, and results are expected within a very short time. It is believed that foreign elements are at work, since the missing documents have not been found. Fools. They will never find these documents. On this film I have record the secret of those documents for my country. [CHUCKLING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Who's there? STOOGES: Us, your neighbors. Hello. Ha-ha-ha! How do you like it, Bortch? But what are you dressed like this? We got a job. We're passing out handbills. Heh-heh! That's good. We'll bring you a sample tonight. Tonight? Tonight I will be on the ocean. My visa has expired. They are throwing me out of the country. I have to go back to my native land. That's too bad. Boys, I want you should do me a favor. I'm having too much luggage to take to the ship. I want you boys should carry these melons for me. In an hour you meet me at Pier 7. The boat will be there. MOE: Okay, pal. Now we will have a farewell drink. Oh, boy, a drink. Oh, boy. A little drink, now. This you will love. Pre-war. Ha! Heh-heh! Good. Well, here's how. Ah. Ah. Whew. Ah. [LIQUID POURING] [CHIRPING] [CONTINUES CHIRPING] Pre-war? The next one. [SPLUTTERS] This is Pier 7. I wonder where Bortch is? Aw, we're early. My dogs are barking. I'm gonna take a rest. Me too. MOE: Me three. [BOTH GROANING] [INSECT BUZZING] [CHICKENS CLUCKING] [HISSES] Want a Brazil nut? Yeah, I'll take one. [CRUNCH] Oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'll show you how to do it. Hold that. Oh! Oh! I'm sorry-- Oh! Why, you imbecile. MOE: Why, you... I'm sorry, Moe. We didn't mean it. Why, you... ALL: Hi, Bortch! [SHUSHES] Come on. Hello, Bortch. Hello, boys, I'm glad you're here. Come in. We had a tough time out there. Yeah. Hey, pass my blindfold. I'll fix you up. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, boys, wait. No, no. I-I'll take the melons, boys. Okay. Easy. There we are. [INHALES] Ah, I love the briny deep. It does something to me. Hey, number four in the blue book. BOTH: ♪ We're off to see the sea ♪ ♪ To see what we can see-- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's all this about? Don't you know? We're known as the Fish Market Duet. The Fish Market Duet? Yeah, we sing for the halibut. [ALL LAUGH] Go on. What's the matter with you guys? Clean yourselves up, here. Come on. [WHISTLE BLOWS] There you are. Well, boys. I, uh-- Guess we'll be going. So long, Bortch. Hey, the boats moving. We better get out of here. Yeah. [HORN BLOWING] It's no use getting excited. I got a secret for you. I am a stowaway, and you are stowaways. [LAUGHS] [ALL LAUGHING] Hey, what are we laughing for? Boy, now we really got something to eat. I'm sorry, boys. I have only enough for me. Aw, have a heart and give us a piece, will you? I don't have enough. Now leave me alone. Don't you understand "Engles"? I told you, I don't have enough. Now shut up. And I mean shut up. I'm telling you for the last time, shut up. Or I'm going to beat your head in. I'll cut your throats from ear to ear. And don't bother me anymore. Go away somewhere. I'm starving. You're keeping me from eating. Now let me alone. And don't interfere with my appetite. Leave me alone. Drop dead. Now, don't get excited. Go on and eat. [CRUNCHES] [GLASS SHATTERING] [SIGHS, CHUCKLES] Good. [COINS JINGLING] [CRUNCHING] BORTCH: Where did I put my garlic? [CLEARS THROAT] Hey, Bortch. [BLOWS] [SNEEZING] [CHUCKLES] Right face. One, two, three, four. [CONTINUES SNEEZING] Oh, delicious. If I only had some whipped cream. [CHUCKLES] Oh. I wish I hadn't eaten so much of this. I don't feel so good. I wish I hadn't eaten so much, either. I wish this boat would stop wobbling. Oh, softies. Can't take it, eh? Ha-ha-ha! I'll eat it. Don't worry about it. Ha-ha! [LAUGHS] Give me the high seas, give me the salty water. [MUFFLED] Oh, boy. [LAUGHS] They can't take it. Oh, no. [GROANING] Oh, no. [SHEMP CONTINUES MOANING] What's the idea? Spilling water on me. Go on, beat it. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES, EXHALES] [SPLUTTERS] [BOTH SNORING] [GRUNTING] Suckers. Let them sleep on hard boxes. I'll swing myself to sleep. Heh! Oh. How do you like that? [GRUNTS] [WHIMPERS] [BOTH CONTINUE SNORING] [GRUNTING] I made it. Now for a little peace and quiet. [BABBLES] [SNORING] [STOOGES SNORING] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! [BOTH SNORING] Oh, what a nice sleep. Ah! Oh! Oh! What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? [SHEMP SNORING] Get up. Come on. Oh. Oh, why'd you wake me up for? Why didn't you let me sleep, so I wouldn't know how hungry I am? He's right. Hey, why don't we eat the watermelons? Come on, let's go. Come on, boy. [SNORING] [CHUCKLES] Look. I don't see nothin'. Oh! [GROANING] Oh, what big seeds. Oh, a prize. What's this? Hey, get the other melon. [CONTINUES SNORING] Aha. Oh. No wonder Bortch acted so mysteriously. The melons. That melon is here. Hi. MOE: Bortch is the spy that stole those government documents. We'll turn that baby over to the authorities. [BORTCH SHUSHES] Now, you hold this film for safekeeping till we do away with that spy. That's what you think. That's what I said. Hello. Eee! Run! Argh! Give me that film. BORTCH: Give me that film. I've got you now, you rat. Let me have it. That took care of him. Oof! Yoo-hoo! Nyah-nyah. [GROWLS] I get you. Nyah-nyah. Nyah-nyah. Nyah-nyah. Oof! Oof! Nyah-nyah. Why, you. I'll kill you. Oh-oh-oh. [SQUISH] Give me that film. Give me that film, or I kill you. No, no. You give me that film. Keep away from me. Hey, kid. I'll brain you. Oh! Oh. Bull's-eye. Ha-ha! Why, you... Do your stuff, baby. Whoa! Why, you back-biter. I'll take you in myself. Mr. Bortch. Yes? There we are. You got him. Nice work, Moe. We'll turn this bird over to authorities at the first port. See if we're near land. Aye, aye, captain. Oh! Get out of here. Oh, no, not again. Land. Land! [♪]
