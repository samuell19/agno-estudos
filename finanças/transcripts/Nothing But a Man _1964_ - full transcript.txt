Thank you, ma'am. - Ain't it a wonderful meeting? - It certainly is. Thank you, ma'am, that's fine. You must be new in town. I'll have me some of that punch there, too. I haven't seen you around, have I? No. I'm new in town. You working? Yeah. On the section gang. I see. You work around town? I'm a teacher. Oh. Went to college, huh? That's right. Where? Birmingham.

Frankie, you ain't got nothin' on your mind but your hair. Hey, Riddick, how about your car? Yeah, you can have it. Man, you won't like that back seat. Why mess around with a chick like that? You won't get nowhere. Hell, Frankie, they're all after the same thing. Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money. What do you know about women, Pop? Well, I got married to one of them. Hell, I didn't know you was married. Sure. Got a 16-year-old girl. Is that right? You think you're gonna make it with her? How about the keys? I bet she's easy jam. Just get her drunk. Thank you. I know you pay no mind to my feelings, but do you think it's right for you to go out with him? I'm 26 years old, Susan. Perhaps you ought to tell her, Frank. Well, we have a position in town, Josie. We have to remember that. There are lots of other young men. I don't think your mother would have approved. I do. Well, there's just one thing you can be looking for in a man like that. I know that's what you think. Hush your mouth, child. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter. What did you expect? You know, baby, I just can't figure you out. How do you mean? Why did you come out with me? You slummin' or something? No. Well, what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this? You don't think much of yourself, do you? Hell, that's a funny thing to say, ain't it? You keep asking me why I'm here. Yeah, and you keep on not answerin', too. Well, I like a place with a lot of life. How about another beer? No, thanks. Go on, you can have one! No, thanks. Aw, hell! What is it? Well, if it ain't Duff. How you doin'? Hi there. Hi. You, uh, mind if we sit down? We was just leavin', fellows. Come on, Jocko. The man's got homework. See you around, Duff. Yeah, see you in hell. They must work on the section gang. That's right. Well, they seem just like everyone else. Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails. We do! Come on, baby, let's get out of here. School teacher. My nappy head. I guess it's hard working on the road like that. There's damn few places a man can make 80 bucks a week. I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you? That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble. How do you mean? Well, I don't get on so well most places. I see. That beer made me dizzy. You got a lovely face, kid. Ain't too often I get a chance to meet a girl like you. Hell... Baby. How many times you been kissed? Well... Let's see now. Not counting tonight... must be about 28 times. Yeah, you've got a problem, all right. Hi. They doin' anything? No, nothin'. Get out of here. Don't, Duff. Relax, man. What's goin' on? Cut that out. I said cut it out! Don't start no trouble, boy. Let's go. That's the preacher's girl. Mess with him and you'll get old man Johnson on your back. Come on. Let's go, Duff. Take it easy. Yee-haw! They don't sound human, do they? How come you stay around here? Well... my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids. That's why you come back, huh? It's hard to see any change, but I'm gonna stay. Another year, anyway. You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town. It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago, they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything. Scared, huh? Well... good night, baby. Not here, Duff. Oh, I get it. Yeah, I can see your old man with a shotgun right now. But I would like to see you again. You would, huh? Mm-hmm. If I was you, baby, I wouldn't go around stickin' out my jugular vein. What do you mean? You almost got into trouble back there, you know. I wouldn't have let you. Baby, I ain't in the third grade, you know. Well, look... what are we gonna do next time? We gonna have a nice, long chat in the parlor? No. On the porch. Oh, yeah, and then what? What? Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now, you don't want to hit the hay, and I don't want to get married. You have some very primitive ideas, don't you? All right, so I'm primitive. So what you want with me? Look, Duff... most of the men I know... they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day, I had the feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other. Hell, baby, I don't know what to say. Good night, Duff. Whoo-hah! Hah! I got him! Over there! Are you finished, Jackie? Yes, ma'am. Well, I'm not. Wait till class is dismissed. All right. Class dismissed. At first, it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. It really got under my skin, though. I almost didn't come back. Why did you? I don't know. I guess I belong here more than there. Been up north? Yeah. I knocked around a couple of months, after the Army. You been there? No. Well, it ain't that good up there, neither. Might as well make it here. Of course, I ain't really makin' it now. Anyway, they can't get to you if you keep movin'! Oh, I'm sorry. Come on in, Josie. We're all through. Daddy, this is Duff Anderson. Hello. How you doin'? All right, son. This is Mr. Johnson, our school superintendent. How are you? I'll be right back. So you're courtin' the preacher's girl, huh? You just better watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into Hell. I'm counting on you, Reverend. I understand. Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this. I know. I'll talk to the Mayor. That'll make the folks very happy. It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks, these days. Yeah. Well, I guess it ain't ever been easy. It's the changing times. Sit down, son. Thank you. Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school. How come y'all ain't sendin' them all to the same school? Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years. And we're not going to have any now. You can't live without trouble, can you? It's a nice place you got here. It's real nice. Yes, the Lord has been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you? I guess I ain't. Why? Don't you believe in the Lord? Oh, I do. It's just... seems to me us colored folks do a lot of church-goin'. It's the white folks that need it real bad. I think if you tried living in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune. I doubt it. I see. Well, I guess you and I don't have much to say to each other, now, do we? I guess not. And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter. Well, that figures. That fits in with everything else, don't it? I'm sorry. It ain't your fault. That's the way he is. Yeah. It's just like I figured. What do you mean? Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I've been thinkin'. Look, Duff... if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow. Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham. Just for the day? I'm goin' to see my kid. I didn't know you had one. Yeah. Well, I do. Are you married? No, I ain't married. Well... good-bye. Well, what do you know? Surprised? No. Women always follow me around. I'm just going in to do my shopping. Oh, it's just a coincidence, huh? That's right. Okay, I'll see you later. Sit here, Duff. No point in running away from coincidence. Baby, you must be crazy. How old is your boy? Four. What's he like? I ain't seen him in a couple of years. Are you Effie Simms? What do you want? Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson. It's about time you showed. The door's open. James Lee... come in here and meet your daddy. Where's Wilma? She done moved to Detroit. Ain't she gonna take the boy? She got herself a husband now. They don't want him around. And I'll tell you, man, I got no use for him, neither. I've been sendin' her money. Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick. Like where? I don't know. He's your boy. I ain't sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different. James Lee, I said for you to come in here. How you been, boy? Go on. Tell him. I got you something. Doctor says he could use some shots. Look... I'll be sendin' you the money from now on. Okay. Make sure he gets those shots. They say your dad's around town. Is that right? I thought he was up north. People have seen him around. Where is he at? I don't know. Are you Will Anderson? Who are you? I'm Duff. Wouldn't have known you. I wouldn't have known you. What's on your mind? Nothing. Heard you was in town. Wanted a look at your old man, huh? Yeah, that's right. How about a drink? Okay. What happened? Workin' a saw mill. There's two. Hi. Baby, I want you to meet Duff. Hi. He's my son. Come and have some coffee. I'm Lee. Sit down. Come on, Will. What's the matter? You mad at me? No. Why? Nothin', baby. She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ, I haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' on some insurance money. And, man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more. Well, let's get out of here. This place gives me the willies. You got some money? Let's stay here, Will. What's the matter? It's a celebration. Thanks. So, what's this about a woman? You got woman trouble? I said I come into town with a girl. Plannin' on getting married? No. Don't sound so sure. Well, as a matter of fact, I've done a lot of bangin' around. Yeah. That's how me and your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.

But you haven't eaten very much. How about it, Frankie? I bet you could eat some more. No, thanks, ma'am. How's that job comin'? Well, it ain't the railroad. Those guys are scared. Guess they ain't never known nothin' but takin' it. They all got families to support. Yeah. That's right, Jocko. Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at 'em. I guess you'll be making some changes around here. What's eatin' you, Jocko? Nothin'.

That's right. I want to talk to you. Okay. I hear you're tryin' to organize this place. I don't know what you're talkin' about. That's no way to talk, boy. We had one of them union men around here a couple years ago. He stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys. I still don't know what you're talkin' about. Are you a union man? I used to be. On the railroad. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now, what's all this talk about stickin' together? Well... what do you know? Now, look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now, I got an idea you're plannin' trouble. No. You got the wrong idea. All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here that you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together and all. Want to keep your job, boy? What do you think? Then do like I said. Men! This boy here has got something he wants to tell you all. Well, how about it? Boy, you're actin' like a nigger with no sense. All right. Go down to the office and get your pay.

I got to get me a job. You will. Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's. They won't. I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here. We can always do that, Duff. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I ain't really thinkin' about it. Anyhow, I don't want them white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out. Yeah, we can use you. Ever work a saw mill? Yeah. Where was that? Walker and Williams. What did you say your name is? Anderson. Sorry, boy, there ain't nothin' here. Hi, Frances. How you doin', man? Okay. Cup of coffee. I've been meanin' to talk to you. Oh, yeah? You know, over at the plant, there's just one guy that talked. Is that right? It's kind of late to say it, but we should've acted differently. Thank you. Been over to the other mill? Yeah, I been there. It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up around here. It kind of took us by surprise. Oh, yeah? Well, that's good. Well, if you tried all the mills, there ain't no other industry around here. How about that furniture plant? Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola. Yeah. Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton. They done that too long in my family. Well, they pay you 3 bucks a day and all the cotton you can eat. Yeah, I might have something for you, if you want to put on a uniform. What's the pay? Pay's $10 a week, plus tips and lunch. I see. Ain't for me, thanks. Now, what about soap? I got enough. I got a good buy on soap. You go on over there and take a look. Right over there, go ahead. Yeah? - I'm lookin' for work. - I got a boy. Thanks. Hi. Don't ask, baby, huh? How much money you got with you? About $10. The water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car. You can have what I've got. It's right there. Startin' tomorrow mornin', we got work for 15 hands. All we're gonna pay is $2.50 a day. Can't pay you the $3, 'cause there ain't gonna be much of a crop this year. Now, y'all who want to work, step up and we'll take your name. It's not as hard on a girl. They're not afraid of us. You know, Duff... we do have enough money. Especially now. Sure, baby. In fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that? I'm trying to help, Duff. Yeah! I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway. What the hell could you do? Day work. You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street. No point fixin' it. What are you gonna do? Don't do that! Watch out! It's good kindlin'. What's bitin' you now? You heard me. I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it. Stop bein' so damn understandin'. I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way. Don't look like there's a right way. Well, you have to be reasonable. Now, they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along and get what you want. It ain't in me. Well, you'll be in trouble, son. Now, just how do you intend to support your family, huh? I guess I'll rob a bank. Don't you get smart with me, boy. Maybe you ought to move. You'd be a lot better off in the North. So I've been told. It's for your own good. Oh, yeah? Seems to me, Reverend, you're more concerned about your good. I guess it looks kind of bad, havin' me for a son-in-law, huh? You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't last. You won't make it. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out. Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger. You've been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You're just half a man. Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He may have a job for you at his filling station. Oh, yeah? I'll be seeing you. Bye, Dad. Bye. How come you don't hate their guts? I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them. You were plenty scared that night in the car. Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside. Like hell they can't. They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on. Not if you see them for what they are, Duff. Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk. You ain't never really been a nigger, have you? Livin' like that in your father's house. So just shut your mouth. That's 2 bucks, Joe. Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through? Okay, I will. Hey, Duff, run the truck down Holly Road. There's a guy in a ditch. Sure glad to see you, boy. I guess I was kind of lucky, huh? My wife's gonna give me hell. How you doin', boy? Okay. Want me to hold the light for you? No, thanks. Just tryin' to be helpful. Most folks around here got no use for niggers. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy? Okay. Seems a little loose. She'll do. She ain't comin' up even. Jesus, I told you to watch it! Sorry. That's the trouble with you boys. You don't listen when a man tells you something. She don't look no worse to me. Well, it didn't do her no good to get banged like that. Don't do her no good to run into a tree. What did you say, boy? I said she's in great shape. I heard you. Now, instead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here! Can I help you? We'd like some service from that boy there. Like the way he takes care of us. Okay. Fill her up? No, boy, 38 cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it 39. We got business with you, boy. You gonna apologize to our friend here? Didn't hear you say "Yessir!" Don't they say "Yessir" where you come from? Boy, you hear me? That'll be 38 cents. God damn it, nigger, you must think you're white! Who do you think you are, king of Harlem? How about this windshield, boy? We'd like a little service. Hell, they're getting too big for their britches. Yeah, his wife's the same way. Struttin' through town like she owns the place. Shakin' that little rear end. Must be all that education they're getting. Real cool, ain't he? Just like we ain't here. That'll be 38 cents. You in a big hurry, boy? Yeah, he's tryin' to get home. Bet she's pretty hot, huh? You better watch your mouth, man. I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself. All right, now, you get out of here! Who're you tellin' to get, boy? You watch your mouth or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here. Dyin's gonna be done two ways. Let's go, Al. He ain't worth it. Now, you stay out of it! What's goin' on, huh? You better get rid of this white-eyed nigger here. What happened? Never mind! You keep him workin' 'round here and this place won't be around. And I ain't kiddin'. I guess we got trouble. You ain't got none, Mister. I'm sorry, Duff. Don't tell me. I know. I called the gas station. I've been worried. If they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no how. What do you mean? Nothin'. Quit lookin' at me like that. Duff... I love you. Well, that don't do me one damn bit of good. Come on, honey, let's go to bed. I never should have married you in the first place. Ain't you gonna say something? There's nothing to say. Well, that'll be the first time. Where are you gonna go? When I get set, I'll send for you. I don't think that'll happen. You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways. You're not a man because of a job, Duff. You don't know nothin' about it. Nothin'. And don't kid yourself... you did your bit. Okay. Duff... Like I said, baby, I'll write you. Who is it? It's your son. My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff? That's right. Beat it! Take it easy, Pop. What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must've broken some records. Come on, Pop. There's nothing you can do. Been like this for days. Got no use for nobody. Huh? What is it? What's the matter? Now you lay down and get some sleep! Oh! You let go! Now you stay put. I ain't drunk, honey. Like hell you ain't. Got a thick feelin' here. What's the matter? Better now. Where you at? Right here. Couldn't get the words out before. Better get him to a hospital. Didn't I tell you to beat it, huh? Let's go, Will. Anything you say, baby. Duff. Duff! He stopped breathing. We thought you might want these. Thanks. Would you like me to say anything tomorrow? I guess so. Have anything in mind? No. What you usually say, I guess. Where was your father born? I don't know. His profession? Well, he worked around. And his age? I don't know. 48, I guess. - Any other family? - No. Just me. Me and her. Well, I guess that's all until tomorrow. Okay. Thanks very much. What are you gonna do? Want to come up to the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point in paying a hotel. No thanks, Lee. It's just that I hate empty rooms. Sure. Well... what are you gonna do? I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town. Going back, huh? That's right. They'll run you out. No, they won't. How are you gonna live? Ah. I guess I can always chop cotton if I have to. If you want a ride, I'll take you home. No, thanks. I'll take the bus. Okay. Don't be too hard on him. Hell, I'm just like him. I know he wasn't much of a father. Who is? Goodbye, Duff. That window's broke, boy. You stay over there, you're gonna get awful wet. Hi. It ain't gonna be easy, baby. But it's gonna be all right. Baby... I feel so free inside. It's all right.
