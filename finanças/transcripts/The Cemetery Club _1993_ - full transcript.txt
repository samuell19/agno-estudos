Thank you for my heart.I love you. [ Laughing ] I don't wanna be late. I don't wanna miss the grand entrance. The groom is 80 years old. How late could we be ? [ Chuckling ] Where did Selma find this one ? I got a theory that Selma studies the obituaries. She reads where some well-to-do guy, his wife dies, so Selma calls him up and pretends to be a childhood friend of the deceased. Then she offers him a variety of condolences. They met on a cruise, Jake. - Jake, you have your keys ? I forgot mine. - He's got 'em. I can feel 'em digging into my leg.We should've taken two cars. What, this seats six beautifully.This seats six painfully. Oh, Lucille !what ? She put a run in my stocking.Oh ! I'm sorry. You should do like me. I'm gonna put my stockings on when I get there. Also the bra ? [ Man ] ...According to the laws of Moses and Israel. Do you, Selma, of your own free will, take Irving to be your husband ?i do ! She'll take him... For everything he's got.Shut up. What's with all this feckuckteh polynesian stuff ?the cruise was to Tahiti. Do you promise to love, honor and Cherish her throughout life ? I, I do. - How much are you giving ? - Same as for her last one. Seventy-five.too much, too much. That's right, I'm giving 50. I go down 25 each marriage. See, I told you 100 was ridiculous. I'm takin' 50 out.Jake, I'll slap your hand. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may break the glass. [ Whispering ] I'll do it. [ Glass shattering ] Aren't you going to kiss me ? A big juicy one. What a racket. Thank you, thank you. Hi ! [ Applause ] ♪♪ [ Orchestra ] ♪♪ I don't think he's gonna last a year. ♪♪ She's so beautiful.

[ Selma ] I tell you, I think it's worse to lose somebody the way she did, you know, suddenly like that. It's something you never get over. - I'm gonna get some wine. You want some ? - Thanks, Selma, that's nice. Personally that's how I wanna go, quick. Sounds good to me. We'll take you to the movies, Esther.We'll play gin. And we'll -- ah, Doris. Who's the looker ? The rabbi.I didn't recognize him without his tallis and everything. He's a good-looking guy ! Lucille, you're out of control. Hmph. So, let me tell you what happened. Thank you.Anyway, I can hardly sit in this dress. It's so tight. So, they're having dinner... In this lovely restaurant when all of a sudden Murray grabs his chest, and he falls face down, right smack, right in the food. I tell you, it makes you really stop and think, huh ? Crystal, make sure everything's okay. Yes, ma'am. Esther, for god's sake, let US do this for you.I can do it. Esther, we will do everything.I just want to wash a few -- I hate it out there with the mirrors covered and everything. I just hate it. It's Shiva. You're supposed to hate it. Hi, sweetheart. I've already washed those. Lucille. You okay ?yeah, I'm fine. I'm gonna kill Mel Goldstein. Schmuck grabbed me a minute ago. Made an offer to buy dad's car. What a horrible human being.Hope you told him to go screw himself. Lucille, watch your language.Where's my mom ? She wanted to be by herself for a moment. Are you all right, sweetheart ?yeah, I'm fine. I don't know what she's gonna do. She depended on daddy for everything. She can depend on US now. We will look after her. Mom ?go ahead. Grandma ? Doris and I, we've been through it. Sometimes life is hell, sometimes it's a bummer. I didn't want you to be cold. Mm-hmm. A "bummer" ? You call losing a husband a "bummer" ? She knew what I meant. How do you come to use a word like that ?it's just a word. A bummer is getting a run in your stocking, not losing your husband ! A bummer, Doris, is what you are right now. Hmph. You sure you don't want me to stay with you ?no, thanks. You go on. Jessica's exhausted. So am I. I'll be all right, honest. Okay, good night.Good night, Paul. Good night.Good night. Mom. I'll call you first thing.Okay. And so, as we gather here... To unveil and dedicate this metzaveh, this headstone and resting place to our beloved Murray moskowitz, we acknowledge that a mourning cycle of one year... Comes to an end. May his soul be bound up in the bond of life. Amen. [ Man ] Morning, morning, how are you ? Beautiful unveiling. Now, did you get the bill yet... For perpetual care ?no. Lucille, did you ?i haven't paid the last bill yet. [ Lucille ] Hi, al.Hi, ladies. Listen, when blue cross pays me for Jake being sick, I'll pay the cemetery for Jake being dead. You didn't get a double headstone. How come ? I have a nine-year-old granddaughter. It's bad enough she has to see her grandfather's name on a tombstone. What would I put under mine ? "Coming soon." Atta girl.Ladies ! Gerty, 80 years old, is telling a friend about a date she had. She says, "he took me to the movies. If I tell you, the guy was an animal. "I had one eye on the picture, the other eye on his hands. "His hands were everywhere. Here, here, here, here. Buthe couldn't find my money." So where was the money ? Forget it. It doesn't matter. - It's a joke, Doris. - That was a joke ? That wasn't a joke. A joke has a punch line. - It had a punch line. - A punch line is funny. That wasn't funny. - You have no sense of humor. - I have a sense of humor. What I don't have is a menu. If henny youngman had you for an audience, he would never have got past "go." If roseanne had you for a waiter, she'd be a size two. Oh, uh, the gentleman over there sent over this v-8. Oh, my god, do you know who that is ? I never saw him before in my life. Sol hyman, big in mail order. He heard you had the unveiling, so he's making his move. His move ?he does it with all the widows. - He tried it with me after Jake's unveiling. - You're kidding. Esther, you know Rose Solomon ? He went after Rose Solomon in the cemetery. I don't believe what I'm hearing. Believe. You're a single woman now -- - I am not ! - Lucille ! Please. I'm not saying she should go out with this guy. All I'm saying is, now, you're in the market, kid. The market ? The market. And guys are going to start hitting on you. And there is nothing wrong with you getting a little [ Clicking ]. - I don't wanna hear anymore. - What is the matter with you ? What ? I'm not saying anything the rabbi didn't say. I don't remember the rabbi standing over Murray's grave saying... She should get a little [ Clicking ]. He said that now is the time for you to go on with your life. Same thing. Only in your diseased mind. Could we just drop the whole thing, please ?don't pay any attention to her. You okay ?I'm fine. [ Lucille ] Jake's municipal bond comes due today, and that is how I am going to pay for this coat. You're already wearing the coat. Yeah, well, I already wrote a check. That's why we're here, so I don't get arrested. You about ready, Esther ? Yeah. Gail thinks I oughta cash in Murray's bonds, but... I don't think I will. I think I'm gonna leave everything just as he planned it. So... Let's go to the cemetery. Why the rush ? I have to pay this guy this bond. I don't want to be late for the cemetery. What ? If you're a little late, he leaves ? She doesn't remember what day this is. She remembers. She just... forgot. It's Abe's 4th anniversary today.Oh, my god, I forgot. Would you believe four years ago today ? You remembered. Of course, I remembered. She remembered.Of course she remembered. How could I forget ? Abe died almost exactly one year before Jake. - What ? - It was two years before Jake. - Two years ? - And three years before Murray. So then, Murray died one year after Jake. That's what i'm trying to tell you. So who died the year before Jake ?[ Together ] No one. - Are you sure ? - Of course I'm sure. Positive. Abe died four years ago today ! That's what I said ! Hmm. Why don't the two of you meet me at Abe's grave when you're finished ? We can have a little gathering for the anniversary. [ Esther ] We'd love to.Sure. And uh, janey's boy, little Bobby, looks more and more like you every day. This... is from his third birthday party. Look at that face. Your smile. Also, your big ears. It's hard, Abe. The kids try, but... They live so far away. They're all so... Scattered. So, Jake, read any good books lately ? I guess I'll have to do all the talking again. Nice, like when we were married. Except now at least I know where you are every night. [ Man ] Hey, wait a minute. It's called perpetual care... Because that's what you're supposed to do, take care perpetually. Look, I got about 1,000 graves to deal with. I don't give a shit about 1,000 graves ! I'm talkin' about one ! This one ! Myrna s. Katz ! You got it ? If you don't take better care of it, you're gonna find yourself a lot closer to your work ! Don't threaten me, asshole ! Who are you pushing, huh ? Oh, my god. Who you push-- who the -- aaah ! Get off my leg. Get off my leg ! Ow ! That's my ear ! Let go of my ear ! I'm callin' a cop ! I'm callin' a cop ! I am a cop !you should be ashamed of yourself, you asshole. Come back here. Come back, come here. Ashamed of yourself ! I'll punch the shit outta you ! Come here ! I'll be back ! I'll be back.You'll be back. You... creep ! You see that ? That son-of-a-bitch bit me. - I'm sorry about the language. - You had every right. I just, I just get crazy when they, when they don't take proper care! So, you visiting someone in the neighborhood ? Yeah, over there. You come to the cemetery, your wife stays home ?lucille. My wife is who I came to visit. She was a very nice, neat woman. And the grave, for being such a mess, it's just not right. I'm sorry again about the uproar, okay ? That's all right. It, it was very exciting. Thanks, you're a good sport. Have a nice day. You too. Did you see it ?what ? The way he was undressing me with his eyes.Undressing you ? You better believe it.I missed that. Come on. [ Bottles clattering ] Hey, you missed the excitement. I don't care about men fighting. I care about having a few moments... To think and remember Abe. Of course you do. [ Sighing ] [ Whispering ] He's a good-looking guy. Shh. Why don't we invite him to join US at nader's ? Lucille.we know he's single. I don't believe this. [ Lucille ] What ? How much longer do we have to stand here ? I would just like to have a few moments of silence for my husband... Who died exactly four years ago today ! It's okay. Okay. [ Sighing ] Have you ever seen him before ? Look, you wanna pick up men, do it at Jake's grave ! - Doris. - No, she's desecrating Abe's memory with her behavior. This is bullshit.Lucille. -Tramping on my husband's grave. -What am I standing here for ? Just because Abe kicked off three years ago today -- four years ! Four years ! - Terrific ! - That's it ! This whole day is ruined !doris. Shot to hell !doris ! Doris ! I'm sorry, Abe. Rest in peace. You stand at Abe's graveside as if he had died yesterday. That is the way I will stand for as long as I live. For as long as you live ? Good. So from now on, you can do it without me. As of today, I officially resign from this -- this... Cemetery club ! Hmph. Come on, you two, don't be like this. I've had it up to here with this goddamn cemetery. I refuse to be in a club where half the members are dead. That... that... Is a terrible thing to say. I guarantee you, if we took a roll call right now, three of the members would be marked absent. And that is why... We visit them. Doris ! Where are you going ? To the bus ! You wanna keep trimmin' Ivy ? You can do it with Doris. [ Sigh ] When you're ready to start living, you can do it with me. [ Sighing ] Bye, mur. Hey ! Why are you so humpy so early in the morning ? Let me guess. Maureen ? What happened to corene ?what do I know ? I've been going with Mildred for six months. Aaron's diner, Mildred. Oh, that Mildred. You know, you take up with these short-order types, then you get pissed off... When they can't replace Myrna.That's wrong. I'm not lookin' for somebody to replace Myrna. Myra was it.Okay, then. Then how come you keep punishing yourself ? You quit the cops, which I know you love, Ben. But professional hacking ? Drivin' a cab ?

I guess whenever I feel the need. This week would have been my tenth anniversary. Uh, I felt I should go. Only the tenth ?uh-huh. Murray and I were married for 39 years, practically my whole adult life. I married late. Came as a surprise marrying Myrna. And we had seven wonderful years together. How come you never married earlier ? Well, I always figured I wasn't the marrying kind. - And then all of a sudden you were ? - Yeah. You think you're used to living alone. Then, out of nowhere, you're not used to it. What about you ? Oh, when I was 18 I had a summer job... Playing piano for a tap-dancing class. And, uh, one day I walked into moskowitz music to buy some sheet music... And, well, three months later I was married to Murray. He got you before you learned to drive. Or much of anything else. [ Doorbell ringing ]Excuse me. Hi !hi ! Hi. We ran into each other at nader's. Are you going to invite US in or shall we stand on the lawn with lanterns ? [ Laughing ] Ben, Ben katz. Uh, this is Doris and Lucille you met last week. - He did ? - At the cemetery. We bumped into each other. He was visiting his wife -- I mean, her grave. The cop. Well, I missed the action. Yeah, I took Jessica in to buy some sheet music... And there was Ben in the store. We just bumped into each other. Again, you bumped into each other.That's two bumps in one week. We were just having some coffee. I'd love a cup. Um, uh -- Even I wouldn't let a stranger into my house. - You're a married woman. - I'm a widowed woman. And he wasn't a stranger. That's right. He drove you home. You should give him a set of keys. I still can't imagine what you thought you were doing. You'll end up on the news. They'll be interviewing Doris and me, friends of the victim. Going out with a man... Of that sort. - And what sort is that ? - The sort that for a living makes tips. He is an honorably retired police officer, a sergeant. Please ! A Kojak he's not. I don't want to hear another word on this subject and I mean that. Suzanne darling, block out June 18th. I need the works ! The full megillah. Renaldo ! Wash, cut, color. Michelle, I'm gonna need my nails with tips... And a wax... bikini.

This guy, this guy is great ! Oh, I'm nuts about him. I'm head over heels. - He's got money. - Like it's growing on trees. Which in this case, it really does. - You know the, uh, bonfigliano fruit emporium chain ? - Sure. Well, he is ed bonfigliano. Bonfigliano ?

Great, because this time I want you three to be the bridesmaids. What ?what ? What happened to the ones you used the last time ? I never use the same bridesmaids twice.

[ Man ] Hello, Esther ? - Yes ? Who's this ? - Ben, Ben katz. Oh, hello. [ Keys clanging ] - Am I interrupting something ? - Oh, no. I mean, my daughter's here, but -- who is it ?shh. Um, did, um, Jessica leave something in your taxi ? Oh, no, nothing like that. I was just calling to ask if, if maybe you would want to have dinner together one night. You mean, like in a restaurant ? I mean, US ? Yeah, US. Go to dinner... out. Is someone asking you out on a date ?will you be quiet ! - What ? - Oh, I'm sorry, not you. So what do you say ? You're gonna love this place. The food is sensational. You like Italian ?i think they're very nice people. Everything okay ? [ Clearing throat ] I haven't been on a date in 40 years. Would it make you feel better if I... Promise not to order the same thing you do ? Or, uh, we could sit at separate tables. Or better yet, I could drop you at this restaurant, then I'll eat somewhere else altogether. - [ Chuckling ] - Come back, pick you up. Sure. You got beautiful teeth. Thank you. They're all mine. [ Panting, gasping ] Esther ? Esther ? Remember I told you Murray died of a heart attack ? Yeah ? It was while we were in a restaurant. Oh. That table over there. - Oh, my god. - Mmm. Waiter ! The thing is, a cop can carry a gun loaded with the same ammo for sometimes 20 years. Really ?they don't fire their gun. They don't change their ammo. That's what happened to me the time I got shot.You got shot ? Here you go.Uh-huh. Bring US some fries. Hey, katz, long time no see.John ! How's the job ? Great, man !good, good. This lunatic had taken a hostage. We had him cornered. I was workin' with this canine cop. Now, he and his dog were ahead of me but hugging the dirt. Suddenly, the perpetrator pops up in the window and takes a shot, misses the canine couple, gets me in the shoulder. Clean shot. Bullet in, bullet out. I'm standing there breathing through my mouth... When this nut pops up again and shoots the dog. - No kidding ? - No. A dog still on a leash ? That wakes me up. So I run in the room and I shoot the perp. I get him right in the mouth. Oh, god. What happens is, the diseased bullet I shoot only cracks his two front teeth, cuts his palette, after which he swallows the bullet. Now, this upsets him. He starts dancing around screaming and we jump him. I don't believe you. Can I ask you a question ?sure, go ahead. Have you ever told this story before ?oh, yeah, a few times. Does it always work for you ? I mean, with women ? Never fails, until now. [ Esther ] So by the time the ambulance got there, he was gone. It just seems so unreal. You know, there we were, enjoying a wonderful dinner and -- when I got home that night, his cigar was still in the ashtray. His toothbrush was still damp. You know ? I mean, I just -- I couldn't make sense of it. It's like, one day... You're looking into his face as he proposes... And the next day you're standing at his grave, remembering how nervous he had been. And between those two days, 39 years had gone by. Well, how about you ? How come a police officer... Leaves the force and decides to drive a taxi ? It's hard to explain. I, uh, I quit when Myrna died. - Why ? - Kind of a gesture, I guess. She never wanted to be married to a cop in the first place, but she did. She was always scared. I felt bad for her, but I didn't quit. I put the house in her name, took out a life insurance policy. She didn't like to talk about things like that, so... I never told her. I know she prayed for me every day of our married life. Seven years. I never prayed for her. Then she was gone. That's when I quit. Too late to do her any good, but like I said, a gesture. You see this shrubbery under the bridge ?yeah. That stuff is so thick that Robin hood and his gang could hang out safe. [ Esther chuckling ] [ Woman on TV ] This is your last chance; If one piece of candy gets past you... And into the packing room unwrapped, you're fired ! [ Lucy ] Yes, ma'am. Let 'er roll ! [ Esther and Ben laughing ] Oh, no. Ah, grandma ?oh. I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep. Excuse me. What are you doing up ? Are you having bad dreams ? [ Man ] After the ceremony in the renowned lombardi chapel, we have everyone come down this breathtaking... Scardino staircase. Then, of course, we all end up here in the penelli room... For dinner and dancing, uh, under the magnificent gambino chandelier. That'll be a big surprise for your guests, because the chandeliers... Weren't here for your last wedding. So, you ladies take a look around. I'm gonna go get the menus so we can put together the dinner. And you wanted to go kosher Italian, right ? Yeah. And my husband is gonna take care of all the fruit. Of course, we'll be honored, thrilled. Excuse me. Oh, isn't this staircase romantic ?it really is. Selma, could I ask you something that's very personal ? What's the point of asking anything else ? Don't you find it hard to, you know, be with somebody, after being with somebody else for a long time ? Not really.But to fall in love all over again ? I don't wanna be in love like I was the first time. If hal was five minutes late coming home, I'd be hysterical. I'd be standing by a window, ripping my hair out, worrying... Is he dead somewhere in a car accident ? That kind of love takes too much energy.Oh. I don't know what would be harder. Being with someone that I didn't love or... Falling in love all over again. Esther, at our age you don't fall. You get hurt too easy. When you're young, it's not so bad because you heal fast. But at our age, the heart is like the bones, just a little more fragile. So, I'm careful not to fall when I walk, and I'm careful not to fall when I marry. You know what I want at this stage in my life ?uh-uh. Comfort, security. I want a friend. A good dancer. [ Chuckling ] Ah, Don Juan I don't need. Ed bonfigliano is just fine. Huh ? Okay, try it again. [ Engine sputtering ] Wait a minute. I don't know what you're bothering for. Esther, you can't let a car sit this long without running it every once in a while. Okay, try it again. Go ahead. Esther ! Oh, uh, sorry. [ Engine revving ] She's back to life. Wh-what are you doing ? Scoot over. Why ? Lady, you're gonna learn how to drive ! What ? Are you outta your mind ? It's ridiculous for you not to drive. But I can't learn how to drive at my age.And what age is that ? Never mind what age it is. It's not driving age.Well, think of it... As a big wheelchair with a motor.Oh. Put your hands on the wheel. Put your foot on the brake. Okay. Yeah. Now, I'm gonna put it in drive.Okay. Oh ! Oh, we're moving. We're moving. Whoa !sorry. You all right ? You just press your foot down on the brake gently.

Oh, uh, uh -- [ Clears throat ] Go ahead, Doris.Thank you. I'll just get straight to the point. We know you and Esther have been seeing a lot of each other lately, and that things are getting pretty serious. So ? Esther is totally shook up. I have never seen her this upset. The truth is, Esther is on the edge of a nervous breakdown. We have watched her try to keep control ever since Murray's death. She is terribly fragile, deeply, deeply vulnerable. Whatever is going on, whatever you have pushed her into, she could crack like an egg. Wait a minute. I haven't pushed Esther into anything. Unfortunately, she has also been under the influence... Of a person with no moral character whatsoever. And who are you referring to ?i think you know. Why, because I don't think she should spend her life polishing Murray's headstone ? Ladies, we're not getting anywhere here. Ben, I have to be frank with you. Esther is not used to your type. What kind of type is that ? Esther's husband, Murray, was a very gentle man, no rough edges like a cop naturally needs to have. You see ? Come here. Listen, ladies, I know you're trying to help your friend, but this is between me and Esther, know what I'm saying ? Let's go.Let's go. This door !get it ! No. No, thanks. I thought I oughta -- the other morning, I had to get moving so early. Oh, that was perfectly all right. I had to get home early too. Well, listen, Esther, that night, it was really wonderful. You are a fantastic lady. Fantastic ! I don't know what the hell you ever saw in a guy like me. You're so far out of my league. You don't have to put yourself down, Ben. Please, it's -- it's really not necessary. What does that mean ? Well, just that I -- I understand what you're trying to say... Because I've been thinking the same thing myself. As a matter of fact, I was gonna call you. We just moved too fast, that's all. I mean, we're such different people. And it's obvious that we just could never... Have anything lasting. Yeah ? Well, that's just what I figured you'd think. Thanks for being so honest. Well, I thought I owed you at least that. No, you don't owe me anything. I'm just grateful I knew such a -- such a -- such a beautiful woman... That was so smart. Well, smart enough, anyway. No, don't get up, please.Let me drive you home. No, thank you. I'll call a cab.
