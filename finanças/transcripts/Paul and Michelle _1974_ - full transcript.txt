This I would like to do with particular pleasure. Sir Robert is my father. Thank you, sir, for coming here today. Thank you for talking to us. Thank you for making us laugh. As your son, I think you'll forgive me for saying I've heard a good many of the jokes before. And I'm delighted to see they're wearing so well. Thank you. You know, when I was your age, my father expected me to carry off all the prizes. I wasn't exactly banking on you. Jolly good, anyway. Thanks. - When's your flight? - Uh... 7:30. So, you're going to spend your holiday wandering around France? That's the plan. Why not come home to Paris a few days? We could go eating and drinking together. No, really, thanks, dad. I'd rather get going. Would I be right in thinking... Yes, you would. I'd assumed you were over all that. Please realize it was just a childhood thing, finished three years ago. Puppy love. Best forgotten. I mean, there are plenty of fish more... - Well, more suitable. - I dare say. So you're going to spend your time looking for her? I'll find her. Well, if you do, and you start all that up again after... after all this, you'd be very foolish, Paul. Anyway, I trust I can count on you to turn up at the beginning of the Sorbonne term? Of course. Well, look us up. That is, if you have the time. Congratulations, anyway. - Paul, was my speech really all right? - Fine. Fine. Well, um... Bye. [BELL RINGS] How did you know that Michelle had been sent here? I didn't. But she talked about a cousin she stayed with in Paris. But the cousin had moved to Dijon. I went there and asked around until I found her. She told me Michelle had come here. You went to a great deal of trouble. Does your father know of your coming here? He knows I'm looking for Michelle. - Does he approve? - He doesn't mind. Please... Can't you just tell me? - Is she here? - No, she isn't. Where is she then? We found Michelle a home and a job with some people called Bellancourt. They run a patisserie in Nice. How long ago? Last September. And she's still there? As far as I know. Come with me. - I'll write the address for you. - Thank you. Take this big one. I've made it specially for you. - You are Monsieur Bellancourt? - Yes. I'm looking for a girl called Michelle Latour. I was told she works here. No. Not anymore. Madame? - When did she leave? - Six months. Seven maybe. But where did she go? How should I know? She didn't like the job, so she walked out. Pftt! Finish. Please, monsieur, it's important that I find her. I'm sorry. I cannot help you. What's going on? Nothing. Nothing at all. Excuse me, monsieur. I think your friend's still in Nice. I saw her in the market last week. Oh, thank you, mademoiselle. Michelle! Michelle! Michelle! [HORN HONKS] There you are. What time will you be home? I got to meet a flight from New York, so should be around 10:00. Okay. Just soup and salad, all right? Sounds marvelous. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Come to mommy. Quickly. [HORNS HONK] Michelle. Sylvie, darling, you remember I told you one day your papa would come back. Now he has. This is papa. Hello, Sylvie. Never mind. - I'd given up hope. - I hadn't. I knew it was just a question of waiting, then finding you. Did you get any of my letters? I wrote 27 times. Not one. Where did you send them? Your father's house in Paris. Bet my lovely stepmother enjoyed reading those. I didn't know where on earth to write to you. Why don't we have some lunch? Sylvie and I have to go home. Home? Does home mean you're Mrs. someone or other? No, nothing like that. But I do live with Garry. He's been very kind to us. - He's quite old. He's 32. - I see. Paul, what can I say? I had to leave my job. That man Bellancourt? Garry used to come to the shop. He rescued us really. He knows all about you. Everything. How I've been waiting all this time. So what am I supposed to do? Come to dinner tonight. Meet him. Then you'll absolutely understand how it is. Oh, no. Well, all right. What time? About 7:00. Garry will be interested to meet you. Where do you live? Rue Dauphine, not very far. - Hello. - Hello. You look so smart. Thought I better not let you down. Come in. Garry's with Sylvie. - Like some wine? - Oh, thanks. It's very nice, isn't it? Yes. We like it. Thanks. Sit down. I'd rather stand. How did he take it? Garry? Oh, fine. He just said he'd heard so much about you, it would be nice to meet you. [SYLVIE LAUGHS] Garry's reading to her. She's mad about Red Riding Hood. I'm glad he's so good to her. On, he's very kind, really. You seem quite fond of him. I am... quite fond of him. - You look absolutely marvelous. - Oh, no, I don't. I didn't have time to ch... Well, you do. Hi. Well, it's great meeting you, Paul. I've heard an awful lot about you. Micky looking after you all right? Got enough wine? Good. Good. Here. Let me take your jacket. I'll give you a hand. And get rid of your tie. Make you feel more at home. Well, Micky tells me you're going to university soon. Yes, the Sorbonne. Oh, that's right. Your home's in Paris. That's great. Mmm. Oh, Micky... Sylvie wants to say good night. - Why don't you come, too? - All right. Paul, I hope you don't mind my saying this. You've got a beautiful daughter. Thanks. I don't know what I'd do without her. Hello, Sylvie. It'll take a little time. Come on now. It's time to go to sleep. Good night, Sylvie. And what about a kiss for papa? Good night, Sylvie. How about some more, Paul? There's plenty. Oh, thanks. The Mother Superior tells me you're a dab hand at making pastry. She always wanted other people to love what she loved... God and pastry. - Hey, steady on. I'm driving. - Come on. Drink up. I just can't get over how you and Micky made it in that godforsaken swamp, in a crummy hut. Incredible. Two 15-year-old kids without a dime between you. It wasn't a hut. It was a cottage. Michelle's father had been a painter. It had been his studio. Yes, and it was not a godforsaken marsh. It was just beautiful. The Camargue is the most beautiful place in the world. Anyway, I admire you two. It must've been something, running off like that. We were very much in love. Weren't we, Paul? Paul, can I get into bed with you? Please, Paul. Very romantic. Quite a fling. It was not a fling. It wasn't at all like that. Not at all. Well, it's been really great meeting you, Paul, after hearing so much about you. - Good night, Michelle. - Good night, Paul. - Drop by again, will you? - Thanks. Who's looking after Sylvie, Garry? No, the concierge. She often does. Where's Garry, then? - Tonight's his Judo Club. - Judo? Yes, he loves it. He's the club champion, you know. Oh, he would be. You seem very nicely settled in with him. I was awake all night... thinking. Before it was so easy. Just you and me to think about. Now there's Garry and Sylvie and you and me. Well, don't look so serious. Come on. Let's go. - Where? - Anywhere. Tell you what. I'll blindfold you and take you to a surprise place. All right. We'll go to the negresco or the casino or somewhere like that - and have a magnum of champagne on the terrace. - Oh, wonderful. Come on. Oh, please, don't go so quickly. Come on. [LAUGHING] All right. We're here. Come on. One step up. Where are we? Only the best hotel in Nice. Queen Victoria slept here. Another step. Well, here we are in the great marble reception room. - Shouldn't I take this off? - No, no, no, no, no. But won't people stare? Of course not. They're much too well brought up to stare. Wait there. Thank you. Here. - Madame, you are too kind. - No, just too old. Tomorrow you can buy her a real one. Thank you. - For you. - Oh. What is it? A rose from the management. They reckon if they give you a flower, you're less likely to steal the hangers. Where are we going now? The bar. I thought we'd start off with a drink. It's incredible, the bar. Ceiling like a night sky. Oh. Where are we? It doesn't smell like a bar. A palatial bedroom. Oh. Ha ha ha! - How about the chandelier? - Oh, it's marvelous. Ever since we met this evening, I've been hot, then cold, hot, then cold. So have I. Funny. I'm cold now. Have I changed? Let me see you. As if for one moment I could ever have doubted. Did you ever? Only at really bad times. - What are we going to do? - I don't know. I want nights and nights and nights like this. I must go back. Garry will be home in 20 minutes. I don't want you to go. Five minutes. Michelle Latour, you're indescribably, earth-shatteringly, nerve-rackingly beautiful. What are you thinking? We smell much sweatier now than when we were young. And we're a million times more passionate. And otherwise just the same. [CAR STARTS] Paul... What time is it? We slept for two hours. I must fly. Oh, don't go. I'll phone you. - It's after 1:00. - I know. When I got back at 11:00, which is when I said I'd get back, I found Madame Vert asleep on the sofa. Apparently you said you'd be back in an hour. I know. Where were you? With Paul. If I hadn't guessed, I'd have been worried. I'm sorry, but we had so much to say to each other. Did you make love? - Yes, we did. - Oh! Oh, goddamn it, Micky. Why did you have to do that? We wanted each other. You wanted each other? Well, I hope it was good. - Was it good? - Yes, it was! Just like we remembered. Oh, for God's sake, Micky, you're in love with a dream. I'm sure what happened between you at the time was marvelous, but it's over now. I'm not in love with a dream. I'm in love with Paul. Ive always told you that. I've always told you that. From the first day I met you, I told you. Okay, go off and try it. I don't care. You go down to your love nest in the Camargue. Enjoy his schoolboy mind and his schoolboy skin. But just remember that what I feel for you is not a schoolboy crush. As a matter of fact, I think if you gave it a chance, it might really become something. Shh! Don't cry. Come on, Micky. Don't cry. I don't know what to do. I can't help it. Hey... Sorry if I was angry. Don't worry. It'll all work out.

Let's see if there are some horses. Let's see what state the bedroom's in. Okay. Where are all the bedclothes? They need airing outside. And then we must clean the room and light a fire, too. Oh, anything else? Oh, and, Paul, you go out and split some logs. You haven't forgotten how to split logs, have you? - And the lamps need filling, too. - Blimey! We're home all right. - Michelle Latour, Sylvie. - Paul Harrison, Sylvie. - You must get the bath out. - Oh, not tonight. Well, tomorrow. We must all have baths tomorrow. It'll be rusty. Well, what's a bit of rust? What's a bit of rust? You're good at things like that. - Like what? - Unrusting baths. Am I? You could have won a prize at school for unrusting baths. Maybe I will at the Sorbonne. When is the Sorbonne? Um... Two months and 14 days... 21 hours and 8 minutes. Almost forever. Almost. Ooh, I have eaten too much. And drunk too much as well.

He's a girl. - I always wanted a girl. - So did I. Did you ever tell your school friends about it? Are you crazy? They wouldn't have believed it, anyway. It's been so long without you.

Ah, yes. I have your report. My secretary tidies everything so enthusiastically, I can never find a thing. She has some excuse, of course... she's pregnant. Oh... And so are you. The result of the test was positive. Well, congratulations. - You sure? - Oh, yes, quite sure. - No. - What? No, it's not possible for me to have this baby. Why not? Because I'm no longer living with Garry. Garry? Yes, the man who is the father. So you see, I can't have it. Please, you must help me. It's impossible, you know that. It's against the law. - But don't you see, I... - I'm sorry, but no. Now, if there's anything else I can do to help with normal arrangements... There won't be any normal arrangements. I hoped you would understand, being young yourself. I still want to be in practice when I'm old. Now you must excuse me. Garry. Hello, Garry. Ohh... Hey, you've grown a foot taller. - Garry. - Hello, Micky. What a surprise. - Hello, Paul. - Hello. I was in Marseilles, and I thought you wouldn't mind if I came to see you. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Of course not. We're just going for a picnic. - Why don't you come? - You come, Garry. Okay, that sounds great. - Did you get my letters? - Yes, I did. Thank you. I got yours. You're staying in the same place, aren't you? God, what a beautiful place. Not quite so beautiful when it rains, but we love it, Paul, don't we? - Don't you find it lonely? - We like being alone. Sure. - Hello. - These are for you, Garry. - Are they really? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes. Well, thank you, sweetie. What a wonderful girl. I love you, Garry. Hey, do you want to have a race? - Yes. - Do you? - Yes. - You sure? Okay, let's go. We'll race till the end of that road, okay? Okay, do you think you can beat me? Yes. On your mark... Get set... Go! Oh, no. Oh... She's so fast. I can't catch her. Oh, my God. Oh. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. Come on. Oh, gosh! Oh, she's so fast. Oh, what a marathon runner she is. Bloody idiot. Oh, help me. She's so fast. Ohh... Ohh! Whee! Oop-la! - Pick me some more flowers, will you? - Yes. You all right, Micky? With Paul, I mean? Sure. - You happy? - Yes. Good. How is Madame Vert? Still concierging. Sad, though, her daughter died last month. - Oh, the one with the bad heart? - No, the married one. Poor Madame Vert. I think I can just see the beginning of a frown, can't I? - Hmm? What's wrong? - Nothing. I was just thinking about Madame Vert... how she used to say Sylvie should have someone to play with. Yeah, that would be nice for Sylvie. Well, maybe you and Paul, huh? Maybe. - Well, I guess you'll be off to Paris soon, eh? - Yes. Well, if it wouldn't be risking your life, you could send me a little postcard. Here, let me. Did you remember my toothbrush? - New socks, alarm clock? - Everything. Well, what's the face for? It won't be for long... a couple of weeks at the most. - I wish I was coming with you. - So do I, but... I don't know if it will be any good in Paris, all those sophisticated students. Oh, don't be silly. You're much prettier than all of them put together. Anyway, it's best for you and Sylvie to stay here, just till I find somewhere. I'll get it all fixed up, beds aired and everything. - Are you going away? - Just for a little while. - How long's a little while? - Oh, about so long. Mind you eat properly. - Bye, love. - Bye. - Say goodbye to daddy. - Bye. Paul!

I'm not much good at this. Don't be silly. You're doing great. [SPEAKING FRENCH] I tell you this... if they get us this time, we're finished. They'll be on top. That's why we got to succeed. What's this all about? Internal politics, really. All we want is to be allowed to cooperate in the running of our lives here. - Well, what time are we marching? - Almost immediately. I've got a train to meet. I don't think you can get out of it now. Daniel would never forgive you. Well, alright. I'll come along for a bit. Right? Come on, then. Let's go. Hey, hey... Hey! Hey, you will have to pay. Sorry, mate, can't stop now. I'm on my way to a riot. [CHANTING IN FRENCH] Aah! Aah! [SIREN] Sylvie. Aw... What have you been doing? - Have you been a good girl? - Yes. - I'm sorry I'm late. - But what happened? Just a little demonstration, you know. - We had a go at the police. - The police? Yes. It'll be in all the papers tomorrow. Good journey? Very long, but it was all right. Sylvie slept. Well, we'll soon be home. I've got everything fixed up. You'll be amazed by the splendor of it all. - Is it far? - Not far. The bike's just outside. Oh, fine. - Hi. - Hello. You all right? - Fine. How about you? - Okay. Daniel's a bit upset, though, and Susannah's with the police. I think she fancied one of them. She wasn't doing anything. - This is Michelle. Joanna. - Hello. - Hello. - And Sylvie. Hello. - Well, we better get settled in. See you. - Bye. Well? Paul, it's wonderful. Well, I told you I'd fix everything up all right, and look at this. The finest view in Paris... if you've got a periscope. Oh, it's beautiful. And now, the west wing. How's that? Come here, Sylvie. Look at the chimneys. And as for you, my love, you've got a suite all of your own. There. How's that, nice? Now you're going to keep all your toys in there, so you must remember to keep it tidy, all right? Yes. And there's the bed. Why do I always have the smallest room? Well, work it out for yourself. Now, I think you'd better have a little rest. You're tired after your long journey. Lie down. Come on. Oh, you... Feet up. - I've got some food in for tonight. - Oh, thank you. They've gone so slowly, these last three weeks. Sorry. It took a bit of time looking around. I've missed you. I must get Sylvie something to eat. She'll be hungry. Sylvie. I bought Sylvie a gingerbread man with raisin eyes... She'll like that. And silver buttons... And chocolate boots. I made her a chocolate cake. - I brought some for you. - I'll like that. - Ah, good evening, Master Paul. - Good evening. Paul! You made it. Good to see you. I didn't know you're... You invite a few people for a drink, and suddenly you have a party. - How was New York? - Fine, Paul. Very successful. Let's see if we can find you something to drink, hmm? Ah, here's Jane. Splendid! Paul, darling. How lovely to see you. Paul, I want you to meet one of my oldest friends... - Henry, Sir Henry Barton. - Sir Henry Barton. - This is Paul, my stepson. - How do you do? Would you forgive me for a moment, please? Eh, Robert never told me he had a son by Ena. I can see the likeness now. Quite a girl, your mother. - Was she? - Yes. - Are you interested in anything special? - Yes. Why? I just thought you might be. The young are so damned interested in everything these days. - Terrifying. - I'm sorry. [HITS CYMBAL] Why, Paul. I thought you'd slipped away without saying goodbye. Drums still in good shape, hmm? Pretty good. Well, nothing much has changed, has it? All just the same. Well, the room's yours whenever you want it. You know that, Paul. Thanks. Giving up creature comforts is part of the fun of being a student, isn't it? I'm very well looked after, thanks. We're nicely set up. We? I came here to tell you. I spent the holiday with Michelle and Sylvie in the Camargue. Now they're here in Paris. We're all living together. Stop that damned drumming! I might have known this would have happened. You young fool! Getting caught up again with that little tramp, whose only purpose... How dare you say that? She knows a hell of a lot more about loving than you do! When have you ever cared for me? You only care about appearances! Don't you shout at me! I have no intention of standing here to be shouted at or insulted. I also won't help you in any way until you've come to your senses! As from tonight your allowance is canceled. - We'll do without it! - Will you? How about your food, your rent, buying your motorcycle? I can do without it. We'll manage. When you've had enough of it, let me know. I'll... I'll talk to you again. I'm afraid you won't have that pleasure. Come in. - Hello. - Hello. - I brought these for Paul to sign. - He's out looking for work. Work? Yes. His father doesn't approve of me. He's cut us off completely. Well, you'd be better off independent. Decent wages are not so easy to find. Is that why you're looking so gloomy? There are other problems. I'm having another baby. Well... There won't be much room for four of you here. Do you want it? Yes and no. Of course, I mostly want it, but... - What does Paul think? - He doesn't know yet. It's easy enough to get rid of it these days. We're all right! We're rich! I'm in work! - Terrific! - Paul! - Starting tomorrow! How about that? - It's fantastic. Wonderful! - Joanna, you'll stay to a drink. - No, thanks. I must go anyway. I'll come about these tomorrow. - What is it? - A petition. - I'll sign anything tomorrow. - Right. I'm glad for both of you. - Bye. - Bye. You're brilliant, Paul. It's just a job. But I can still go to lectures in the morning, work in the afternoons, and study in the evenings. And in the evenings I can go to work. What? You don't really want to do that. Of course. It would help. Yes, but... Well, we'll see. - To the job. - To the job. What sort of job is it? Well, it's not entirely simple to describe. It's a combination of things, really. Agriculture, import, export... Common market. - Papa. - Paul. I'll be all right in a minute. I just get so bloody stiff. Ooh! Sylvie had her supper. I must go. Good night, darling. Bath and bed at half past 6:00. I'll be back about midnight. [LECTURING IN FRENCH] Darling? [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] I'll have to get rid of the baby. What about Paul? He still doesn't know. I don't want him ever to know. Do you know someone who could help me? No problem. Medical friends are all around us. Here. Daniel? Sit down. Listen, you remember how you helped Cathy? Well? Could you do the same for Michelle? She has pretty good reasons. - How far gone are you? - About three months. We'd better get going as soon as possible. The thing is I haven't any money. - I put it all down to practice. - Thank you. - You fix everything up with her. - Okay. You'll be quite safe with Daniel. He's a fourth year medical. I'll be there, too. Got it. - Dr. Duval? - What is it? I'm late. I'm on casualty duty, sir. There is a case here. - You are from the university? - Yes, sir. Daniel Gunnard, fourth year. Simple fracture of the tibia. I'd like to handle it, sir. All right. Sister Mercier's on duty. When you're through, get her to check it. - Thank you, sir. - Good luck. - Sister Mercier? - Yes. - We need a theater at once, please. - Impossible. It's an emergency. For Dr. Duval. Theater four. In 10 minutes. You're beautiful. Everything's going fine. Don't worry. - Ready? - Ready. - Is this the appendix? - No. Fractured tibia. Theater four. Ah, yes. Well, let's have a look. Sister? Dr. Duval just called. He needs you urgently in casualty. Dr. Duval? Well, thank you. Don't worry. It'll be fine, over in a flash. Here's something to make you sleepy, help you relax. All right, let's hurry. We haven't much time. Dr. Duval? Casualty, here. Sister Mercier wants you to come at once. An emergency. Thank you, doctor. - An emergency, I gather. - Yes. I came at once. - Well, what's the trouble? - Don't you know? Why should I? - But, uh... - You sent for me, didn't you? - No. You wanted me. - Did I? - I understood. - Oh, well, never mind. Nice to see you. We weren't due to meet for another four hours and then certainly not in casualty. - Oh, the fractured tibia. How did it go? - Very well. Well, a very pretty job, I must say. I wish some of our resident staff were as efficient. - Off you go. - Thank you, Sister. Ready? The car's right outside. We'll get that off on the way home. Put these in your pocket. If you have any pain, take one. If it's really bad, take two. - Okay? - Okay. I don't know how to thank you. You've been wonderful, all of you. Forget it. Come on. Don't worry. I'll be all right. I wish I knew what to do. I think I'd better go for a doctor. - No, Paul, please don't! - Well, why not? Because tonight I had an abortion. Why? I couldn't carry on with my job much longer having a baby, could I? Your job? Your bloody job? Whose baby was it? I suppose that's irrelevant, really, isn't it? All the same, it's not the sort of decision to have to make on your own. I didn't want you to know. Shh! It's all right. It's all right. Listen, you're not going to work so hard anymore. I'm used to my work now. I can do longer hours. I'll be all right in the morning. Really, it'll be much better for both of us. I'll cut the odd lecture and still have time to be with you and Sylvie. No arguing. - All right? - All right. - Hello, Garry. - Hello, Micky. Well, how are you? You look terrific. When I called you, I thought you sounded a little tired, - but you're looking as marvelous as ever. - I'm fine. - Hope you don't mind my calling you. - Of course not. Let's sit down. I've been wanting to see you. There are so many things I want to say. I don't know where to begin. Okay, but let me tell you my news first. It must be good news. You look so pleased. It is good news. I got promoted. New York. Maybe California next year. Oh, that's marvelous. I'm so pleased for you. Yeah, it'll be a new life. I like that idea. I'd really had Nice once you'd gone. - Hey! What's up? - Nothing. I was just imagining you in New York. You've never been there, have you? - You know I've never been outside France. - I know. Of course, my first reaction was... I know it sounds silly, but my first reaction was, Micky and Sylvie would like New York. Well, anyway... I'd love to have seen New York. I'd love to have shown you, but you're happy, aren't you? - You've got everything you ever wanted. - Yes. I guess that promotion came too damn late. Come on, I'll walk you back. It'll take a bit of getting used to, knowing you're not there anymore. It'll take a little getting used to New York. So, we'll be a thousand miles apart... - both getting used to things. - Yep. Hey, you had something to tell me. Did I? Oh, well, I don't suppose it was anything important. Okay. I'll buy you a book. Maybe you can find some crazy old French love poems that I wouldn't understand... or something like that. Hey, Paul! Hey, Paul, come and sit down. Up the workers! - How's the meat business? - Flourishing. - I'll get you some wine. - No, thanks. I can't stay. Oh, yes, you can, and tomorrow night you're going to the concert. - Concert? - I got you a ticket. Oh, really, I can't. Well, there's Sylvie, and Michelle goes to work at 6:00. - Anyway, I must study. I'm sorry. - But it's a fabulous concert! - You're crazy, man. - Yeah, crazy. - Here's your drink. - Thanks, Joanna, but I must go. I'll be late. Oh, belt up, old chap. Now see if I can persuade you to come to that concert tomorrow night. I'll be at least 20 minutes late. I've said I'm sorry. What were you doing, overtime? No, I stopped off at the cafe and had a drink with the others. They're all going to a concert tomorrow night. I'm sorry about that. - There's some soup ready for her there. - Does she need a bath? Yes, she does! She didn't have one last night! Why is mommy angry? She's tired, love. We're both tired. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in? Are you busy? It doesn't matter. - You work too hard. - I've got to be here. Oh, I'm way behind! You could take one night off for the concert tomorrow night. Get a sitter. - Like a drink? - Thanks. - There doesn't seem to be any. - Never mind. Why don't we go across the street for something? I can't. I've got to undress Sylvie and put her to bed. Paul, how old are you, for God's sake? You've got years to be a respectable married man. Don't start too soon. Well, I suppose if Sylvie's asleep... We'll leave the door open. If she calls, then we'll hear her. Would you like me to tell you your fortune by reading your hand? - Okay. - I know how to do it. Can you? Oh, great. Okay. That means you're artistic and intelligent. - And, let's see... those four lines... - I'm sorry. I'll have to go. Michelle! Michelle! Well, what are you doing here? I felt sick. They sent me home. But what were you doing, leaving Sylvie? - I saw you. - What do you mean, you saw me? I wasn't trying to hide. You left her alone. I was out for 20 minutes. She was sound asleep. So that's what you do when I'm working. What do you mean? - I saw you with Susannah. - Oh, shut up! - I'm tired! - Don't think I'm a fool! - Don't think I haven't noticed! - Don't be so ridiculous! Here we are so short of money, and you buy her a drink. Should I screw her here on our bed? Stop shouting! Anyway she paid for her own drink... coffee! So this is how it's to be? - When I'm working, you and Susannah... - Stop behaving like a jealous old wife! Don't you trust me? Paul! Paul! Sylvie. Sylvie! Sylvie! Sylvie! Sylvie! Sylvie! [CLANKING] Sylvie! - Darling! - Mommy! Oh, Sylvie! Sylvie. She went to sleep at once. Hope it won't be something she remembers all her life. I suppose we're awful parents. - We're both so tired. That's the trouble. - Yes. I'm sorry I shouted at you. I'm sorry I ran out. It was stupid of me. I'm sorry about Sylvie. She's all right. We're not being fair to ourselves, really. No. We must think of some other way. It's hopeless like this. Hopeless. - Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. It's so hot. - Yes. - Where's Sylvie? - Joanna is looking after her. - Paul. - Hmm? You know what you were saying the other night about working longer hours, cutting lectures? - Well, I've been thinking. - What have you been thinking? That really it won't work. It won't be any better. You can't be a student and look after Sylvie and me. I don't see why not. But you want to go on, get your degree, don't you? - Yes, of course I do. - Well, then there's only one thing to do... Sylvie and I must go. Go? But you can't do that. I mean, you belong here, you and Sylvie with me. It's the best way. Not forever. Just for the time being. We'll go back to the cottage, I'll get a job in Arles. Don't worry. We'll manage. You'll be better off without us. But if you feel like this, why didn't you go off with Garry when you had the chance? You should've gone, shouldn't you? Maybe. I mean, why do you want to do all this... the abortion, going away... just for my sake? Something to do with loving you, I suppose. You'd never believe I feel the same, the way I behave. It won't be so bad. We can have all the holidays together at the cottage. Yes, we can. We survived three years once, so I suppose we can get through another three. Can't we? And at the end of those three years when you've got your degree and a good job, we can get a real apartment... With a bathroom of our own... And a beautiful kitchen... And maybe a decent bedroom for Sylvie. All the luggage is in. Here. You take that. - It smells nice. - You're such a wit. - Make sure she writes. - Of course she will. She'll write you a postcard every week, - won't you, darling? - Yes. Bye-bye, love. [TRAIN HORN] - You better get in. - Yes. [TRAIN HORN] Remember, it's only for the time being. For the time being, yes, of course. - Goodbye, Paul. - Goodbye, Michelle. Captioning made possible by Paramount Pictures Corporation Captioning performed by the National Captioning Institute, Inc.
