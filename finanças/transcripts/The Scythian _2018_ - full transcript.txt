Last year, I drank some excellent wine and it was here in this tavern. The swill that we make is far from excellent, but we sure are famous for it. So, what's your name? You can call me anything, as long as you're a paying customer. - And where's Kudim? - Who? The owner of this tavern. He was murdered. Why is that? He watered down the wine and cheated customers, and then he got caught fornicating with a woman who was the wife of a local merchant. Are you sure she wasn't your wife? Watch yourself. Let's roast this duck to take with us? Hey, master? No, wait! Your turn. Bring me a sack. Were they the ones who maimed you? No, it wasn't. Some other Polovtsians attacked me on my way to Konchak. And I was supposed to go instead of you. Then Tatiana would've been mine. You think life with her is sweet? If only I'd known how stubborn she was. And I will say you wouldn't have lasted, not even a week. We're honored to see you and your son, Lord Oleg, at the border to welcome us. Lord Vladimir is offering me to take Chernigov. I see he's giving his neighbor what he couldn't manage himself, but I am not offended. I will take it. Was he too busy to pay me a visit? Then you, noblemen, are my guests. Today they're his guests, tomorrow subjects. If it's one thing I know, Oleg wants Kiev for himself. Get cover, we're under attack. That's him. - You should've captured him. - Yes, but he killed himself. I was late, Lord. But you saved my life. It's my duty, my lord. Hey, Master! Lutobor! My master, it's your wife, she's giving birth! It's a future warrior! Go to her, Lutobor. No, no, master, you can't go in! Not yet, you have to wait here! No, sir, you have to wait here. No, please. Be patient now, be patient. Your lady will deliver very soon. Every new life begins with suffering. Since when are you so wise? When my wife was giving birth to our sixth, I got so drunk so I would suffer less. And it worked. Everything will be fine. So, a son? Wouldn't you love your daughter? Oh no, I wouldn't. How dare she be born before my son? Give me. Look here, you do have a son, master. Lord Oleg is here! He's here! Lord Oleg's here! He's arrived. - So, you have a son now? - Yes, my lord. Will you name me the godfather, or do you have another choice? Are you joking? I would never have dared to ask. - Let's see him, let's see him. - Tatiana! Oh. Look at you. Look at that, he looks just like you. In a year's time, I want a grandson just like him. Lutobor, now this sword is yours until your son is old enough to hold it. It's an honor, Lord. You have earned it, Lutobor. Show us your swordsmanship. This sword is beyond praise, Lord. Are you any good in real battle? Want to test my bravery, Polovtsian? Are you scared? I don't want to contaminate this soil with all your blood. No swords. But instead, you can wrestle. Don't hurt the khan's son too much. They're my allies nowadays. Enough! When a blow is threatened, it's seldom given. Open the gate! Very good fight. I know, but there could be a problem. - Well. - Yes, my lord. That was very good fighting, but you may have an enemy. No, we'll be fine. The Polovtsian was asking for it. That may be true. Well, I'm going. Won't you stay for the celebration, my lord? I'd be happy to, but I have my princely duties to fulfill. Prov! Safe travel, my lord. Give me. Feed the musicians, and heat up some water so I can wash the Polovtsian snot off. - To your health, boys. - Oh yeah. What is this? Look at that, huh? Easy there, my warrior. Save your caresses for later. Is it stitched? You're good as new. I'll seal it with a spell. No, wait. Lutobor! Lutobor! Hurry, we're going now. In to war! - Hey, over here. - They're over here. - Come on. - Come quickly, over here. - This way. - Get him. The bastard's alive. - I've got him. - Can anybody help? Please over here! What are we going to do with him? Over here, please! - What's going on? - Can anyone hear me? Lock him up! Somebody help. Does anyone know what happened? What has just happened? - Pass them to me. - Oh yes. - Over here. - It's so good. - Yes. - Oh. - That's part of me. - Pass them down here. What? Lutobor, my friend, I feel your pain. We'll find them, I swear that we'll make them all pay. - Invite you? - Quick... Quick, pour me some more. Ah, who cares, pour me another drink. Get me out of here. - Very good, very good. - Cheers. I just heard about what happened. What are you going to do? What do they want? Ransom or something else? What do they want? My wife and son... in exchange for your life. That is a high price. And what did you choose? My duty to you, Lord. Thank you. Hold on to the poison for now. Here's to my right-hand man, Lutobor! - Cheers. - Ah. Hey! It was him, he poisoned me! Poison, he has the poison! My husband's going to track you down! We were told not to touch you, but I wouldn't refuse... if you got the desire. Get over there. So, where is Marten? He was killed by Lutobor. Truly convenient, seeing as Marten was going to challenge you as the leader. I was chosen by Ares as the strongest of the wolves. I will lead the pack! Ares will decide that. Huh? But why, Lord? I've been faithful to you. Yes, I know you've been. But I want my enemies to think that you were the one who poisoned me, Lutobor. And I recognized the poison, it's powdered hemlock. A person who takes it suffers for seven days before they end up dying. So, now you have seven days to get your wife and son back, and also to find the man who wanted me to die. - Thank you, I will do it, Lord. - Don't thank me just yet. Now you'll escape, and then I will announce a reward for your head. It's the only way, otherwise the enemies will not believe that you poisoned me, will they? Spare the executioner. I still need his services. Forgive me, my lord, for not sparing his life. Prov, prov! Prov, come here, man. - Master? - Be quiet. Where's the captive? He's in the shed. I think he's a Wolf of Perun, they're a gang of hired assassins. Bring me my sword, my armor and clothes, and water for washing, and quickly! No, wait. Do you want to live, Wolf? Yes, I do. Forgive me, for God's sake, I've done you wrong. Evil people took me in, and lured me into doing bad deeds for some gold. - I really only... - Shut your mouth. Help me get my family back, and I'll free you. I'll help you, I swear to God, I'll get them. I know you don't believe in my god, but you will take our oath. You'll swear it at a shrine, before the idol of your god. Well? I agree. Tell me, where is your master? I don't know where he is now. I haven't seen him since he left for the lord's palace. So, where are you taking me now? Is this an ancient temple? A secret shrine? Here's your god, Perun. Swear an oath before the idol. Perun, god of lightning, I pledge before you to help this Lutobor get his wife and his son back. And alive and well. And alive and well. But his oath has no value. He does not pray to the gods. Who are you, show yourself! He prays to a different god. He is from an ancient tribe that has lost its greatness. The last of them make a living by shedding the blood, isn't that true, Wolf of Ares? You are a Wolf. Tell us, isn't that the truth? That is true, and at home I do honor Ares, but I have respected your god. Tell me who you are. He's Perun's guardian, untie me. His people swear their oaths on a sword that has been washed in human blood. Why believe you? Believe because I am the keeper of ancient knowledge. He's blind. Oh, but is it you? You are the one... who is blind! Are you seeking death, guardian? Oh, but it is you who has found it. Kill him! Calm down now, he's dead. Untie me? Your people swear oaths on a sword washed in blood. Give your word. I give my word. It's good to have your trust, I won't disappoint you. Marten. What? I said to call me Marten. Why didn't you strangle me, Marten? Because I honor Ares, and I wouldn't disgrace him before the god, Perun. So, I will keep my word. I wonder what it's like to have only one wife. Don't you get bored? One is enough for God's servants. Let me baptize you. No, a faith that prohibits concubines just isn't for me. Also, how can a single god rule over all? I mean, all the mountains, and the forests, And the thunderstorms? For you, it's all about women, not thunderstorms. I don't think that you have a chance of going to heaven, mark my word. Lutobor? Maybe I am, but I don't remember your face. My name's Toryan, a merchant. We met once before. I heard some stories about you. What kind of stories? About your strength and bravery. And? Anything else? Lord Oleg's searching for you. There's a big reward, a nice price for your head. But I will not hand you over. Your father said a word for me before the lord once, But I can't be sold or bought, either. And not even for gold. Though, for so much gold, a father would sell his own son. Could Toryan spare two horses? I don't have many, but I will give you two. So, you stay for the night, have some food, some rest. I'll give you the horses tomorrow. They need to rest well, too. Tired horses won't take you too far. That's true, the horses are very tired. But don't tell anyone I didn't hand you in for the reward. People will think Toryan's gone mad and won't do business with me anymore. Well, now my dear guests, enjoy our food. Come on, eat. Savage! You animal! Why did you kill them? They just sheltered us. The merchant's still alive. Lutobor, please spare my life. He was going to send a messenger to the lord, And he was going to collect the reward. In the name of God, please don't kill me. What's your god's name? Is it Dajbog, Perun, or is it maybe Hors? I'm begging you in the name of Jesus. The devil tempted me to be a greedy man. The devil tempted him, then they sheltered us. I think you aren't so good, Lutobor, at judging people. And so Toryan's honor cannot be bought or sold, can it? Yeah? Harder, harder. Harder. You will be given to the man who's the one who paid us to kidnap you. Who is he? You'll find out when he comes to get you. It will be you alone, without the child. And as for your little son, he will either be sacrificed or else trained to become a Wolf. Our young boys start eating off a knife as soon as they're weaned. The training is very tough. Only one out of ten becomes a Wolf. And starts killing people for gold? Hm, we Wolves do not kill... but instead we hunt. For otherwise, my people would perish. Well, then I will pray for my son to avoid such a fate. Then pray, but in our land, your god is powerless. You're not human, you're an animal. Yeah, I am an animal. But when I'm not the hunter, I'm being hunted. Now, we're both being hunted. What? Go on, go, go now. - After them. - After them, go, go. - Come on. - Go, go, go. - Get them. - Get them! This way. - Hurry, hurry. - Go, go, go. - Here, over here. - Go on, faster. - Come on. - Faster. - Come on. - Get him. - Get down. - Get him. There, get him. - Come on. - He's dead. Get after him. Come on! Let's get down the hill! Come on, get up, get up. They'll follow our tracks and find us. So, we'll give them a fight. This could be suicide. We're outnumbered. And they're warriors, not peasants with pitchforks. Warriors or peasants, I really don't care. I can't escape with an injured leg. Hey, Marten? Marten? He left me to die. Hey, over here. One has disappeared... But we're still on their track. I need three of you, come with me! We'll head him off at the pass. And we meet again. Prepare to taste the blade of my sword. Your death will be slow. I'll chop you up and then... feed you to the animals, and when all that's left is your head, I will find your wife, and you'll watch me tear her up. Your bastard will be my slave and my eunuch. He'll live with the dogs and he'll scrub my boots while I drink wine out of your skull at the lord's table. Way too many words. Now shut your trap and fight. That was a good fight, I think. Bandage your leg, and drink lots of water. I'll go and fill the canteen up. Water will be scarce from now on. Lutobor, don't drink the- Don't take anything from the living! That water was no good. Who the hell are they? They're forest people, they worship Veles. They're giving us to Berendey, that one. It looks like no one can beat him. Why no one? No, a crowd with some spears or another Berendey could. Could both of us beat him? Not a chance, but we could try. Uh-huh. Well, we can't just give up. Lutobor, well, it was nice knowing you. What is that on him, huh? We do not take servants of their god, God, as sacrifices. He'll be our slave. Now all praise to Veles! Throw the other one! Down! Go on. That's a good knife! Ares! Lutobor? Why aren't you happy, Lutobor? We escaped death, so you should be rejoicing now! I should be happy... because I killed innocent people in a frenzy? No, because a gift was revealed in you! You can transform into a bear in battle. This gift isn't from God, but from the devil. I committed a sin that'll never be forgiven. I hate to tell you, but with that gift, you'll commit many more sins. No, I won't, I won't. Once a bear has awoken inside you, you can't stop or expel him. Oh, I can, and I will. The bear is only awakened if the warrior drinks the potion, and I will never drink it again. I hear you, but if the gift is strong in you, the bear awakes without drinking the potion, and if the gift is powerful, you can tame the beast, but your spirit has to be strong. But... God is merciful, merciful! He won't let me shed any more innocent blood. Lutobor, that god of yours is weak. Ares is strong, and he has an appreciation for bloodshed. What about your blood, that is spilled by one of your own with a treacherous blow? Now come on. We're almost there. Now I need to blindfold you. Do all outsiders get blindfolded when they come to visit? No, some don't even get blindfolded, Instead they get sacrificed to Ares. That's enough! Didn't you say that Marten was killed? What do you say, Yar? I'll tell you! Lutobor. Don't be afraid, everything's fine, I promise. Oh great one, we honor your greatness through the seasons, always. Now Ares, hear my words. I challenge Yar, leader of the pack. Now make your ruling! The challenge has been made. I accept the challenge of this Wolf, Now make your ruling. Challenge has been accepted. Anagast, I fulfilled the agreement, now release my wife and my son! What agreement is that? The lives of my wife and son for the lord's. I poisoned him. Is that true? We didn't have an agreement with you. The agreement was with the man who paid us to kidnap her. What is this? What about the letter and the poison? What letter is this? We don't know how to write. And who paid you to kidnap my wife? Name? I'm afraid his name must be kept a secret, according to our agreement. As for your fate, it will be decided after Ares has ruled. Lutobor. You swore an oath. Don't worry, I will kill Yar. I'm stronger than he is, don't doubt me, I will keep my oath. What will happen to you? Ares decides who will lead. No one will challenge me, I'm stronger than them. The pack must have a leader. Anagast will forgive me, he will punish me, but he will leave me alive, And as for Ares, I know he'll forgive, too. I swore an oath. What happens if Yar kills you? Then it will be bad, Lutobor. You'll be sacrificed, and your son will be raised by a Wolf. Your wife will be given to the one who paid the gold. Don't worry, I will kill Yar. I know I'm stronger. Hold on, it's not the gods' thing, it's people. Years ago, Yar killed my father and became the pack leader. And from this day onward... the Wolves will follow me. Is that your final ruling, Ares? I am the leader! Ares made his ruling. Is there anybody who wishes to challenge the new leader? Does anybody wish to challenge the leader? I will challenge him. There's no way he can challenge me. He's an outsider. Behold! Ares gave us a sign. The challenge is made. I accept the challenge. Where is my family? Your family has become the pack's catch. They have been paid for in gold. I killed the old leader and I am the new one, so that would mean the catch is mine, too. You are our leader now, all right then. The leader gets the first bite. Follow me. So, from now on, the pack is your family. I'm not going to live with the pack. There's nothing honorable in killing innocent people, Anagast. But we don't expect you to kill. What do you expect of me, then? You're a warrior. Even when the beast awakes in you, human nature prevails. But we are different. We're assassins by trade. Don't you want to live in peace? There's no one to protect us, so that way, the last of us will perish. If you stay here, you'll perish. Of course, I know that. Give me my family back, Anagast, we don't belong here. But you can't go back, remember? You are the lord's enemy. What if I'm not? The man who paid you to kidnap my family is the lord's enemy. The lord is alive and well. He's just pretending to be ill. He trusts me, I'm his right-hand man. If I can find out who wants him dead, he will trust me even more. I will say a word for you. He will take you under his protection, if you agree to be loyal to him. I just need to know who the enemy is. I think we can help with that. Oh, finally! I'm so tired of lying on this deathbed. My lord, I have done as you wished. Now let's see just who wants my death, let's see. Did someone make you do this? Luchezar, Kiev's envoy said I'd rule under Kiev's protection. Forgive me, father, don't kill me! Hm, and how could I? You're my only son. Lord is dead. All hail now to the new lord of Tmutarakan! May he rule wisely under the word of Kiev! Don't celebrate my death yet, Luchezar. You made a wise decision... in taking the last Scythians under your protection. They'll serve you faithfully. Well, where are they now? See, they trust your word, Lord. What is happening, what is happening? No! Help! - Take cover. - Help! No, help! Run. No, no. This is terrible. Tell me why, Lord? In my land, there will be only one people, mine, And one power, that's mine. I have been loyal to you my whole life. We had an agreement, you gave me your word. My subjects do not make agreements with me. They only make pleas, and serve me well. So, serve me well. I am not your servant. Who are you, then? The last warrior. Goodbye, Lord. We've wanted to hunt down those bandits for a while. And now, finally it's done. Lutobor killed my son. He has gone to get his wife and son. So, he is yours, if you like. Come, we're riding now. Riding now. Yeah! - Let's go. - Here we go. * Rambo Media Ltd *
