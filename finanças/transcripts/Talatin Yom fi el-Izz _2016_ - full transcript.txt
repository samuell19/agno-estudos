LIMAN 440 Adawi Al Adawi, sentenced to ten years in prison with hard labor. Yes, he is a bully, but he's the true incarnation of manhood. Sallouka Al Amouh, also sentenced to ten years in prison. Even though he lost his hair in mysterious circumstances, he's funny. Baba Mansi, also sentenced to ten years in prison. The poor are always forgotten. And lastly, Atwa the Monkey, he was sentenced to ten years, too. Honestly, Atwa is... No comment! And of course, this is the morning roll call. And, of course, this is how Atwa starts his morning. I studied all the prisoners and chose these four... to take revenge on the people who put me in jail. To take revenge for me, Al Ghazuli. Adawi! Consider yourself the playmaker of this mission. Sure, but why be so offensive? No, it's is a good thing, you're the fixer. Hey, guys! -How are you doing? -We're fine. Do you remember that matter I wanted to talk to you about? -No, we don't remember. -Very good. I don't want any of you to go to sleep tonight so I can explain to you what it is that you don't understand. -Fine! -Excuse me, sir, I’m going to the canteen. Good luck with that. Come with me. Try not to fall. They're my partners in the mission? It's fate. Mansi! Mansi! Yes, sir! I've gathered you all here to tell you about your mission which, if you complete it, means you'll get out of here and never have to come back. I want to hear everyone's story first so I can decide what part you'll play in the mission. That's the purpose of this interview. Who's going to go first? -Me. -Me. I speak very well. The bottle will choose. But the bottle doesn't know us! It's me! Atwa the Monkey will go first. I am the greatest monkey of them all. Greater than Gamal the Monkey, Fawzi the Monkey and Alaa the Monkey, and the whole zoo. I was married to a very pretty woman. Her name was Fayza. Her relatives from the country used to visit her all the time. -How are you, cousin-in-law? -I'm fine, sir, good morning! You don't need to visit as much, God bless you. Don't say that, man, we're relatives! God bless you, but I have a bone to pick with you. -What? -Why did you upset Fayza? Does she complain every time I come? Yes, she does. She's waiting for you upstairs. It was nice seeing you, have a good morning. -How are you, Atwa, cousin-in-law? -Good morning, cousin. How are you? -This is too much, really! -Don't say that, man, we're relatives! -Things are going well. -God bless you, cousin. -Tell me, is Fayza upstairs? -Yes, she's waiting for you. -I visit you too often these days. -Don't say that, Fayza likes your visits. There we go. Hurry up. I'm coming, what's the rush? Welcome! You brought chicken? -Good morning, Fayza! -Good morning! -Lots of things for you. -You always come with something. Hurry, before your stupid husband comes! -You're always in such a rush! -Hurry, Fayza! -Oh, dear! -Hurry, Fayza! -Bolbol? -Hey, Fayza! -What is it, Bolbol? -Slow down because my heart aches. Duck face. You're sweet like honey! Come back tomorrow, I’m busy right now. I got all dressed up and you're telling me to come back tomorrow? You really do scrub up well! Uncle Said didn't leave before helping me finish my look. -And what a finish! -I want my payment for the pants. Did I say I wouldn't pay you, Bolbol? I'm just a little busy. Busy how? Let's go inside and we'll be finished in five minutes. -I wish. Tomorrow. -No, I can't tomorrow. -Come back tomorrow, sweetheart. -I swear I’ll tell Atwa. Tell him, sweetheart? -Go, sweetheart! Go! -You're so pretty. -Hey, Atwa! -What a damn morning! Everybody in the neighborhood is talking about Fayza's visitors, Atwa! Let them talk! Then you should know she hasn't paid for the pants you're wearing. What? She didn't pay? Fayza! Fayza! What do you want? What are you yelling about? -Are you making fun of me? -What are you talking about? Oh dear! You haven't made a payment for the pants in two months, woman? I made all the payments, dear! I got one payment but you didn't pay the rest. Do you believe this duck face? You're a liar and a jerk! -Really? I’ll tell him what you said. -What did she say? -She called me "honey." -You'd call this face "honey"? I’ll tell you how she made the payment for the pants. I swear on your honor. What a scandal! Everybody watch! Everybody watch! My wife, Fayza, receives men all the time. "Who's that, Fayza?" "He's my cousin!" "Who's that, Fayza?" "My other cousin!" And on top of that, she hasn't paid for my pants. I’ll teach you a lesson, you witch! -You've killed her. -Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! How many payments did you owe on the pants? One year’s worth. She made the first payment and didn't pay the rest. -Did you complete the payments or what? -Her cousin did. What color were the pants? This isn't the time for that, man! The second story. Have some self-respect, Sayed Balcony, and go to sleep like your friends. I’ll tell you what, I will do it. I’ll speak no matter what! -We don't want to hear your stories! -He's not going to speak. What's the matter with you? I will speak. Do I get to speak? Of course you get to speak. I’ll tell you how she made the payment for the pants. I swear on your honor. What a scandal! Everybody watch! Everybody watch! My wife, Fayza, receives men all the time. "Who's that Fayza?" "My cousin!" "Who's that?" "My other cousin!" And on top of that, she hasn't paid for my pants. I’ll teach you a lesson, you witch! -You've killed her! -Go away! Go away! Go away! You'll waste your life! You're such a failure! Yes, that's me. There I am. You're wasting our time pretending to be a tough guy! -No! -Calm down, Adawi. Wait guys, this gentleman did me a favor and brought me here. Continue, Balcony. Continue. Go away! Go away! Go away! -Get in it! -Where are you taking me? -I’m going to hide you. -Where? -On my balcony. -Where? On my balcony. You savage! You monster! -Where do I go? -Go outside. The balcony is spacious and airy, what else do you want? Spacious and airy? Damn you, I'm suffocating. The police will never know you're here. -Don't leave the balcony or I’ll kill you! -Why? Walls have ears but the balcony doesn't have walls. Stay here until we decide what to do about your problem. I am in heaven! Go inside. I can't wait for you to kiss me. Go inside. Why don't you answer me? Yes? Should I sing for you? It's been years that I’ve been into you And your love is always on my mind You never talk and never greet And you never talk! You drive me crazy! Stay here, I’ll be right back. A woman! Give me a kiss, woman. I've been imprisoned on that balcony for a year! Atwa! Why have you left the balcony? I want a kiss, Balcony! I've told you before, you can't break into people's houses! You're with a woman every day, Balcony! Go outside man! It's like a prison, man! Go outside, idiot! -Damn you and your balcony. -Go outside! You never talk What did I do, my God? Solitary confinement has more space than this damn balcony. I should do something. The police. The police! Help me! Help me! Police, I'm a fugitive! Balcony is hiding me on his balcony! Police! -Sergeant! -Let's go! Help me! -Come on, son! -God damn you, Sayed Balcony. Did you ever even dream of a balcony like mine? God damn you and your damn balcony. I was going to die on it and you brought home a mute woman. God damn you! Go! Hey, girl! Take care of the balcony. I'm angry that I didn't tell the police about you, man. I would've been sitting on my balcony right now in peace. We need two days to understand those two sentences. Come on already, guys! Who's next? Come on! -The bottle will choose. -Spin the bottle. Mansi, the third story. I was the best parking attendant in the best parking lot. I would wink and the car would park itself. Any car I washed would stay clean for a month. Talk, then. I was engaged for ten years to a girl named Asila. She was very devoted. She was waiting for me to build myself up. To the point that I called her The Patient One. I can't take it anymore, find a solution, my father finds me a new suitor every day. I just said how patient you were. -I can't take it anymore, Mansi. -You're right. I've decided to go to Libya and make something of myself there. Who goes to Libya and comes back again? Don't worry, girl, everything's going to be all right. What do I do about my dad and his suitors? Do what any honest girl does. Refuse to marry them, is that so hard? -What do you say to him? -I don't want him. What do you say to him? -I don't want him. -Say it again! I don't want him. -What? -I don't want him. -What? -I don't want him! -What do you say? -I don't want him! I don't want him! -So, honey, what do you say? -I don't want him! I don't want him! I don't want him! I don't want him! I don't want him! I don't want him! I don't want him. I don't want him. It's my fault, I made you say that you didn't want him. She doesn't want him! She doesn't want him! She doesn't want him! "She doesn't want him", "she doesn't want him!" What is that? The story of Sallouka Al Amouh. They pick on me! They pick on me! They pick on me! They should with a brain like that. They pick on me! They pick on me! My mom used to treat me and my brother differently, I don't know why. Why did you cry so much, Sallouka? I was like any baby that cries and wants a pacifier. You're so annoying! Have some mercy! You leave the kid on the mosque's doorstep every day. I can't keep him, he's so annoying! -He's our son. -That's true, but he's still annoying. 30 YEARS AFTER SALLOUKA'S WHINING Listen, Sallouka! I've left everything in my will to my son Kamel, I haven't left you a cent. My dear father! -You're so stupid, boy. -And also annoying. -Am I not your son? -No, you're damn irritating! You killed our dad, you irritating boy. He died of his own accord, why are you doing this to me? I am your son. -No, you're not, Kamel is my only son. -And you're an irritating boy. -Kamel is my only son. -And you're an irritating boy. -Kamel is my only son. -And you're an irritating boy. -Kamel is my only son. -And you're an irritating boy. -Kamel is my only son. -Enough! That's enough! There, I've killed him. Who's going to be your son now? And they pick on me. They pick on me. You are an irritating boy, they were right to pick on you! Shut up, honey. Shut up. You talked and you talked, and this one got fed and slept. Who hasn't spoken yet? I'm the only one left, you idiot. Give me my bottle please, Adawi. Talk then. I was the last respectful roughneck. Very tough guys used to work for me. And did people pick on you? Lock it, boy. Lock it. Come on! Come on, boy! Come on, boy! Good morning, guys. -Good morning, boss. -Good morning, boss. -Welcome, boss. -Mind your own business. I want to talk to you, Adawi. What do you want, Tawhida? -Good morning, boss. -Good... Look away, all of you! -What do you want, Tawhida? -Good morning. Come with us. Wake up, man. Go away, man! What do you want? What's brought you here? I’ll wait for you today, don't be late. Wait where? Didn't you agree with my father that you'd come to propose to me today? Yes, but I'm busy today. You need to support me in such moments. Really? I've been supporting you for three years, but today you're busy? Make yourself free for me. You're going to shout at me in front of my men? -Yes, I am! -Girl! You know that I'm not the marrying type. Really? Since when? Why did you come? Quickly. I'm going to the market. -Okay. Ginnesh! -What, boss? Go to the market with Tawhida and if anybody looks at her, tell him that she's mine. Whose is she? -She's yours. -Go, Tawhida. Okay, Adawi, but I'm sick of this. I swear I’ll humiliate you. Go, girl! -Take care of her. -Yes, boss. I don't know who's going to take care of who. Heaven help us! Hot! Hot! Hot! What's wrong with you people? Hot, hot, hot. Can't you see I'm with her? She's the boss' girl. I swear I’ll call the boss, Adawi. It seems that you're cheating, wait. This is Adawi, who gets people what they're owed. Yes, Boss Adawi. Bring the guys and come to the market, boss. They hit on Tawhida, boss. Don't hurt anybody. I have to hit all of them, boss. Hold yourself back, boy. I'm coming. A massacre is going to take place in the market, guys. The market, where there are no real men! The market, where there are no real men! What's the matter? Tell him what the matter is, boss. Tell him what the matter is, boss? Yes. Tell him. You don't know what the matter is? No, tell me. The matter is that I have a hottie. I swear to God, she really is a hottie! -Hottie or not, boy? -Hottie, boss! -Hottie or not, guys? -Hottie, boss! Hottie or not, boy? Hottie. But she's my hottie. Tell them to go easy on him or else he'll die. I told you only to punish him for what he's done in the last three years. Teach him a lesson for the last three years only. Back off! Back off! Back off! Tawhida! Who's next? Nobody's after me. Nobody's after me! Don't worry, boss! I've gathered you here today for a very dangerous mission. You are going to escape this prison to save a woman. -No! No more women! -She's not just any woman, she's a foreigner and doesn't have anyone here. She's a dancer. She seduced a rich, old man and took his villa, garden and cabaret. Unfortunately, the man was keen to make her happy and so he took a lot of different medications. He died, of course. He left her the villa, garden, cabaret and his son, Adham. God bless him! God damn him, you think he's a baby? He's as big as a mule. He closed the cabaret and wants to rob her of everything. Where do we come in? You're to get rid of Adham and reopen the cabaret. And after we get rid of Adham and reopen the cabaret? Then what happens? You kill the woman. I don't understand anything! Is the cabaret inside the villa? Or the villa inside the cabaret? O night! Gain a good man and lose ten jerks Losing a jerk is always an advantage Don't befriend just anyone Having a lot of friends Is not always a good thing A good man is worth a hundred friends Don't ever befriend a jerk A good man is worth a hundred friends Don't ever befriend a jerk Don't ever befriend a jerk A good man is worth a hundred friends But the jerk is worth a hundred foxes Foxes Easy girl I've seen many things Because I'm a good man But all of this changed And bad people can never approach me From now on I will not forgive From now on my heart is dead Those who are good will gain my heart But bad people will never be my friends Bad people will never be my friends I will never forgive From now on my heart is dead From now on I will not forgive From now on my heart is dead Those who are good will gain my heart Bad people will never be my friends From now on I will not forgive From now on my heart is dead From now on I will not forgive From now on my heart is dead I saw many things But those days are long gone I'm really fed up But those days are long gone I'm really fed up But those days are long gone I'm really fed up But those days are long gone My good heart made people think That I'm weak See who's weak now! No more goodness No more good heart People don't deserve my goodness People don't deserve my goodness From now on I will not forgive From now on my heart is dead From now on I will not forgive From now on my heart is dead No more goodness No more good heart People don't deserve my goodness No more goodness No more good heart People don't deserve my goodness People don't deserve my goodness From now on I will not forgive From now on my heart is dead From now on I will not forgive From now on my heart is dead Adham. He used to go to the cabaret day in and day out to annoy customers and make them leave, until he had ruined it. Is there a balcony in the villa? What... balcony? What balcony? What balcony? No worries, boss! How much time do we have to do this? The mission should be done in 30 days, but not just any 30 days. Thirty days of glory. Why 30 days? It's the time I have left before I'm released. Heaven help you! None of you bastards wants to ask me the girl's name? Right, what's her name? Shafika. Her name is Shafika and she's a foreigner? How? It's a nickname. None of you bastards wants to ask me her address? Why the rush? What's her address? It's the first house on Desert Road in Alexandria, Villa Shafika. Her name is Shafika and she's a foreigner? None of you bastards wants to ask the last question? You reminded me. The most important thing is, none of you should look at her during the mission. Otherwise you will be attracted to her and you will fall in love with her. You will ruin the mission and all of you will fall into the trap. Is the trap in the villa? Or the villa in the trap? What is he saying? What is he saying? What is he saying? At 9:00 a.m. all the prisoners will go out to the recreation area. Seven p.m. is action time. All the prisoners, except for you guys, will go to their cells. You'll find a sergeant in the control tower. He's in on everything. He'll meet you by the light. Come on! Come on, man! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Let me play hide-and-seek with them. They're escaping! They're escaping without telling me? The bastards! -This is the villa? -Yes. -I think we should knock. -Are you coming to propose? You're a thief and should jump the fence, what's wrong with you? Stop it! Stop it! Did you forget what Al Ghazoul said? -What did he say? -Nobody is to get attracted to her or like her or love her, or else the plan is ruined and we'll all fall into the trap. The most important thing is that there's a balcony in the villa. Aren't you tired? -Go ahead! -You're taking that thing? I won't let go of what helped me escape. Give me patience, God! None of you should look at her during the mission, else you'll be attracted to her and fall in love with her. Men! Come on! Come on! Come on. -Are you Ghazuli's men? -Yes. Why are you standing there with your backs to me? Never mind, this is just what we're like. We talk from behind and hug and greet from the front. Golly! We should put our heads together to figure out how to deal with Adham. I'd love to do that! There's no need for that, really no need. Go to your room. -Where's our room? -Downstairs in the garden. Let's go, guys. My assistant will bring you everything. And take a shower, you smell. And where's your room? My room? There. There? Can I take you there? Golly! At your service, sir! We'll recapture these men in a few days, sir. We won't rest until we've found them, sir. Bonsoir! The weather's nice. There's even a full moon tonight. Look, Ghazuli, I have four words for you. -Four or ten? -No. Four words are better than ten. -Where are the men? -I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. -I do know. -Good boy, where are they? They went to Dream Park. Very difficult mission, guys. It would've been easier if it was Mission in Tel Aviv. What are you blubbing about, guys? She's just another utterly worthless woman. What sort of woman? She's the hottest woman ever! She's a woman like any other woman. She's human, you guys! -What else could she be? -She's sweet like honey! Level with me, I have a complex about women. Let's go to sleep early so we can wake up early and go get revenge on them. Now go to sleep. I'm going to get some fresh air. I'm going to get some air too. I'm going to walk in the air. -You stay. -We're all in this together! I'm coming for you, dear! God, give me patience! What is this? You're so busy dancing you have no idea what's going on around you! -Get out. -I'm hiding for her. Here he is, I caught the second one. You're cheating on me? Come here! Come out! Okay! What's this? What are you doing here? We came to find out... What this is. What is all this? -Is there anybody else? -Yes, Balcony! Yes? I'm here. Is there no respect? Is there no respect? Is there no decency? I don't understand... All these wolves in your room and yet no dog comes to howl at my door. It seems I can't even relax in my own room. No, you can relax in your room. And if you need a massage, I have silky hands. You mean hands that are used to handcuffs? Sallouka, Mansi, Atwa, Balcony! Yes? I'm here. Out. Get out of here! Come on! -Out of here! -This is so unfair. Come on. -My heart is your prisoner. -Come on, boy. Lock your door from now on so that no one can get in here at night. Excuse me! You're acting like children! Is that the mission we came to accomplish? What a disappointment! Pervert! Those who make women their trade will lose. Get to bed. Get to bed! Because I was correct I am hurt I am hurt I am hurt I am hurt I held them in my heart And I never disappointed them in my life I was correct But I was hurt I am hurt I am hurt I am hurt They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful They were ungrateful She was ungrateful to me And she made me cry She was ungrateful to me And she made me cry She betrayed my goodness And she made me cry all the time And complain all the time Cry all the time And complain all the time No one betrays except the ungrateful No one betrays You forgot me And forgot our love You forgot me And forgot our love I'll forget you And leave you I'll forget you I'll forget you And leave you I'll forget you And leave you. Why, why, why Were you so ungrateful? Why, why, why Were you so ungrateful? You were ungrateful Ungrateful Ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful Do as you want and forget our love Forget our love Life will teach you a lesson Teach you a lesson -Abuse me and forget me -As you want -And tell everyone -You're the one Abuse me And hurt me Abuse me And hurt me You were ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful You were ungrateful What, guys? What were you doing in the bathroom, Atwa? -I was taking a shower. -Man! That's not a habit of yours. What's so strange about it? Who takes a shower at midnight? We're not up to this mission, or this woman. She's got a pair of eyes that would make any guy fall for her. This girl is worthless, by the way, none of you can talk to her. Be men, guys! I think I'm speaking clearly. Half of his words are true! That's enough, you guys! Listen, from now on, whenever you stand in front of this girl, no one looks into her eyes, everyone looks at the ground. You hear me? Go to sleep now. Go! Go to sleep! Come here. -Come here, where are you going? -To the bathroom. Again? Your health is at stake, son! I don't want to hear another sound. You arrogant guy! What is this? You're better than drugs. Give me that, I'm the drugs guy. -You know what I'd like to do, Mansi? -What? I'd like to plant this whole garden with cannabis and build an empire just like Ahmad Zaki in the movie The Emperor. And then get a bullet in my head at the end. -You know what I'd wish for? -What? To commit a crime or kill somebody and get put into the women's jail. Yes, so it is men and women. Hello, Aunt! Did you consider my offer? Yes, I did. And I won't sell the villa. I'm also going to reopen the cabaret. Was there anything else, Adham? You're playing with fire, Aunt, and it will burn you. Who are you? And how did you get in here without a permit? -Who are these men? -I'm her cousin. I was in Iraq and have just got back. I'm her other cousin. I was in Libya. And I'm her neighbor's son. I've just got back from Sudan. I'm her other cousin, and I was in Yemen. And I was on my balcony and just got here. When are you going to leave? When things calm down in the area. Then you'll be staying a while. What are you going to do with them? -With who? -With the band of men downstairs. I'm not thinking about that. These are people from Cairo. They're here on a mission, dear. When they finish it they'll leave. Yes, dear, but they're criminals. They may well complete the mission then decide they want the cabaret and kill you. -What? -You should think about how to play it. -How? -Make them all fall in love with you. No, my dear, you can play with everything but love. That's when you love them in return, but the reason we're going to make them fall in love with you is so that they don't hurt you. How can I make five men fall in love with me? Even I love you, you sweet honey pie! Give me a kiss, girl, come here, honey. Where are you going, sugar babe? R! F! Sibai! Yes, boss? Go to Shafika’s place and kill those boys that are there with her. -Yes, Mr. Adham. -Go! Okay, boss. What do you want, Shafika? Why won't you look at me? Be quick, what do you want? I want you for a mission. We could work together to get some money. Do you know why I don't look at you? Money ruins beauty. I don't ruin things, Adawi. I just need money to open the cabaret. Move! Don't think that they'll protect you. You seem like a good guy, a real man. Get your hand off me. And mind your own business. Don't play around with me, get straight to the point. Okay. A quarter of a million pounds. Take this, and take your loser friends, and get out of here. Leave my aunt alone. That's what you want us to do? That money will change your life and solve all your problems. Is that what you think? -Say hi to my aunt. -I will. What's this? Money. Adham wanted to buy me off with this. And did he? Nobody buys me. My instincts were right then. I knew you were the one the second I set eyes on you, Adawi. Don't try to play me. -You're going to ignore this beauty? -Your beauty is a curse. I'm a beauty that nobody can ignore. Tell me what you want exactly. You are the man that should protect me. We are all protecting you. What else do you want? I'm here on a mission, Shafika. I will complete it, then leave. This is the money you wanted to reopen the cabaret. Keep it with you. That's all I have. See you. -Come here. -Where? Here. What are you doing? Stop it! Come here, boy. Come here and make me forget the past Come and fill my lonely heart Come here and make me forget the past Come and fill my lonely heart Tell me where you’re taking me. Dear God! What is this beautiful car? -Is it a toy car? -You're the toy. My late husband bought me this car. But I didn't drive it because of Adham. He bought you a car? Whoever married you should have bought you a plane. Do you know what I want? Yes, you want to turn this car into a taxi and for me to drive it. Taxi? Is that what you think, bald man? You noticed that I'm bald? -Can I ask you for something? -Your wish is my command. I feel like taking a ride in this car. But if I take you for a ride in this car I will upset my friends. Your friends? Please, Salluki! Damn my friends! My Salluki! -Have pity on me! -My Salluki! I don't know if I'm Salluki or not right now. Clean the car before we go. Okay. I wonder what she likes about me. Bobos! Bobos! Bobos! Bobos! Where are they? Bobos! "G" is for "getting fat" "B" is for my "big stomach" "Q" for "quickly" -Where did they go? -Our guests? -No, Shafika and Sallouka. -He took her for a ride in the car. I'm sorry! -Is this the time to go for a ride? -It's not my fault. -Damn you! -Forgive me. Forgive me. Go and get me some paper and a pen. No, I'm not into temporary marriage. And I'm not into temporary marriage or formal marriage or proper marriage. Are you into a mutual agreement? -Go and get me some paper and a pen. -Why do you want them? -To write a letter to Al Ghazuli. -You can write? You think Ghazuli can read? -I really love violence. -Really? Take that then! Here it is! Hello, from the King of Liver. Why are we here? I'm going to feed you the best liver sandwich ever. I don't like liver. It's not just any liver, it's an elephant's liver. -Elephant liver? -Yes. King of Liver? Yes, sir? -Two sandwiches of elephant liver. -Are you out of your mind? Any sandwiches, my friend, she's not going to analyze them! Your wish is my command. Two sandwiches of elephant liver. You can see how he has the body of an elephant. I hope you don't grow a trunk after eating it. -Great sandwiches of elephant liver. -Eat, honey. Eat. Eat. -Tell me what you think. -This isn't elephant liver, you liar. You want us to kill an elephant so that you can eat a sandwich? Eat! I will show you our beautiful urban neighborhoods and the beautiful people in them, who love and help each other. Everything is beautiful here. -Listen, man. -What? -I want this girl. -Why? Isn't she with someone? -I said I want her. -You're causing a problem! God damn you, Shafika. You've stressed the guys with your trip. I don't want you to get so worked up, he's probably on his way. He said he'd be back in half an hour. He's really late. Don't worry, he'll be back. Waiting is the most difficult thing in the world. Come here, I’ll tell you all about the pain of waiting. I've been waiting for "the one" for years. -He won't come. -He will come. He won't. I was actually considering that you might be too much for me. But now I've discovered that I'm too much for you. -You're too much for anybody! -What? -You're too much for anybody! -You're saying he will come? -Here he is! -Who? Sallouka? The Kanafeh guy! Haven’t you noticed? I haven't eaten anything since this morning. -Why are you standing like that? -I'm standing by myself. And what kind of posture is that? It is the posture of Ramadan Sobhi on the football pitch. If you're Ramadan Sobhi, then I’m Hazem Emam. My God! Is this the cabaret they want to fix? It'll take a lot of money.

Get out, sweetie pie. Get out! What a beauty! I would've taught that guy a lesson if you'd let me. But I'm more handsome with this injury. They're all jealous, pretend you don't love me. We were-- What's wrong? Is this the international day of getting beaten? -Stop it! -I want to tell you something. What is it you want to say? You again? Stop it! I won't... I want you to say to me, "I love you, Touha!" Who's Touha? Touha is the only name I can pronounce. Say it to me, just once. -How could I love you? -Because love is blind. I don't understand anything. Do you think I understand anything you say? What language do you speak? The language of love and feelings, the language of sensations. Is that right, Veranda? Veranda? My name is Balcony. Call me Balcony! My Balcony! My God! -Ciao! -Goodbye, my dear! Stop it, Adawi! -That's not enough! -What's this? What are you doing to each other? They're doing that because of you. This one loves you and this one loves you, this one loves you, and even this one loves you. They've forgotten what's important. Everything Ghazuli said was right. Okay, people, let's focus on what's important. We will open the cabaret and solve all of our problems, then I’ll choose one of you. I don't understand what's going on. Don't forget Sallouka Al Amouh. Mansi, manufacturing diploma. Atwa the Monkey. Just so you know, she already made her choice. No Adawi, no Sallouka, no Balcony. No, I want them all. My heart and its key Are yours I said someone would come. I want Shafika to love me, what can I do for her? -An ultrasound. -Is she pregnant? I want her to love me, what do I do? -Do what she likes. -What does she like? What does she like, Bobos? Get her a classic chicken dinner and coleslaw. And that will make her love me? Yes, just listen to what I say. Do you have money for the bus? -Yes. -Go! -One second and I’ll be right back. -Okay. -"Cole" what? -Coleslaw. Bosbos, I want to find a way into Shafika's heart. Where do I begin? Are you asking for directions? I want to reach her heart so that I can marry her. You should marry me as transportation and reach her through me. But it wouldn't be fair to go between you both. She'll have two nights and I'll have one. -Is that fair? -Then give her three and me one. -That's unfair to me. -What do you want now? One night with you and a lifetime with her. -No, my friend, I'm monogamous. -Tell me what I can do to get her. -You're from Port Said, aren't you? -Yes. Get her some fish. Good girl! Who's the best girl ever? The chubby girl! -Good evening, my chubby honey. -Good evening, my heart. I want to reach Shafika's heart quickly. In that case, I’ll make you reach for Shafika and her mother and give you Armenian nationality with no visa. But money isn't everything, romance is beautiful as well. You should be her Romeo so that she becomes Juliet. Romeo? I know who Romeo is, but who's Juliet? He's a chair-maker in Port Said, I’ll take you to see him one day. -But... -You can go. -What's this? Are you trying to kill me? -Who am I? I don't care who you are! -I’ll tell you something, my dear Bobos. -What? I want to reach Shafika's heart. What do I do? Go away and play! I'm not kidding, Bobos. -I want her to love me in a selfish way. -What way? A selfish love. You must be sick. I’ll get you some medicine. I'm not sick, girl. Ever since I saw her, I've been eating more, and drinking more and sleeping more. I just need to marry her. -Come here. -Leave me alone. -Come here and listen to me. -Have you lost your mind? You want Shafika? Pretend I'm Metwalli. Just a little kiss! Where did the boys go? They went to get some things I needed. Stop messing around, girl. What are you talking about? I don't understand why you're so serious. -Be a little flexible. -How? -Come here. -What do you want? -I want a kiss. -Really? Have some decency, close your eyes. -This is how it's done? -Yes. Close your eyes tight. Are you ready? Was that a kiss? All right! -What's this? -That's for me. -I mean, for you. -For me? Did you get hot or spicy sauce? -Hot. -Thank him. Thank you... Mansi. Mansi. Nancy. Nancy? She forgot my name, how can she love me? -Love me. -Love you? From which side? From this side. What a picky man! -Who made Mansi bring this chicken? -Me, I told him you really like it. He doesn't know that it's for me. Every one of them is willing to do anything for you now. Atwa will be a Romeo. I'm Romeo! Romeo! My dream woman My sugar pie My dream woman My sugar pie -Oh my God! -Let him go to hell. What's this beauty? You drive me crazy All this love, Atwa? I wish you'd be grateful, Fayza wasn't. You men are all so playful! I've never loved anybody but Fayza! Go back to your past, my dear, and remember how many times you fell in love. How many times you felt the pain. How many times? No! You should be beaten. I will not get beaten again. Where's this smoke coming from? This is what happens when I remember my past. Let's go. I want to tell you what's in my heart. Tell me. My heart is full of grief because of you. And my hand wants to reach out to you. Reach out to you... I love you, Satamouni, no matter how much they blame me. -What's that smell? -It's this, I brought you fish. What's wrong? Tell me you're okay. Tell me you're okay. Is it your bedtime now or something? Or are you pretending to pass out so I'll carry you? I will make your wish come true, just a second. Just give me a second to record this historic moment. Have you seen Shafika? Who's Shafika? What's wrong with you Egyptians? You're all chasing after a foreigner? I'm the oldest one in this villa. Men were wonderful to me before. Why doesn't anyone want to marry me? They used to marry anyone before. They were open-minded. What's wrong with you men? -Neighbors will look at us. -Why would they look at us? Let them look at our ruined country. All women have Botox. And I can't have that! We are in the Botox era! I’ll go to Shafika. Go see her, that's all any of you are good for. -What's wrong with you? -Why are you all running after her? I'm an open book in front of you. -Close it quickly. -Why? -I'm being totally honest. -Cut it out. -Where's Shafika? Shafika. -God damn you, pretty Shafika. What's wrong, my dear? What is this? This is for adults and you're not an adult, my love. I'm a mess! Why are you upset and crying? Because none of you are paying me any attention. The problem is that you're too big, my love. -What? -Too big. That's what you're good at, making fun of me. I'm too big? I'm a poor girl! I wish a man would pay me some attention! Hello. Like that! Come and see how beautiful you are. Come here. Adawi! You're busted! If you like him, what do you expect me to do? Go to your room. Damn my obesity That makes me need people My stomach disappeared And things have changed And I wore tight clothes And made men lose their minds Why are you all alone? I like to be alone. Why? I'm here. Look, Shafika. I don't want to be unfair to my friends. We're here on a specific mission. I'm begging you to let us finish it and leave. Damn the mission! I love you, Adawi. Don't play with me. You just said that to Atwa, Mansi, Sallouka and even Balcony. Yes, I did, because I was afraid of you. But when I got to know you, I saw that you were kind. But you know that I only love you. Just say it and I’ll be yours. And the villa and the cabaret and everything. Just say it! Be careful. Is he the only one leaving? You've to take good care of him. I'm not afraid of facing lions, I'm only afraid of the treachery of dogs. This is the easiest mission I've taken on, by the way. Don't worry, we'll kill him for you and bury him on my balcony. This slingshot never misses. Ignore these beginners! Atwa the Monkey is your man! Good heavens, hide me, he's come here! Good heavens, hide me! Good heavens! Oh my God, they'll kill us! You idiot! They're shooting! Oh my God! God damn you! I’ll teach you a lesson. -It's me, Mansi, you fool! -I forgot! You scared me! Zaky Chan! Zaky Chan! Tell your boss, if he thinks he's a big boss, I'm Bobos the Great. Hit him! I'm not with them. I'm not with them! Come to Papa! I will drown you. I’ll teach you both a lesson. Where did Shafika go? The angel of death sent me for your soul. Get up!

Honestly, all five are really good men. Go make me some tea while I decide. Make a decision without drinking tea. Do you have to make me work? Make tea so that I can think clearly. Okay, I will make tea, but choose quickly. It's just a man. May the doors to happiness open up for you! -You too! -The fridge door is my door to happiness. Hello, police? Yes, she loves me, she will choose me. She loves me. She will choose me, of course. I'm the prettiest out of all of you. And I just look like Hassan Youssef. You look like a joker! She chose me as soon as she saw me. If she doesn't choose me, she will be making a big mistake. She's into love and romance. Don't overthink it! She chose me, my dreams always come true. Just don't fight and keep an open mind about it. What's this? What's this? You're finally caught. Take them! Wait till we see which one she chooses. She chose all of you, all of you! I missed you! I really missed you. I'm impressed by your intelligence, Shoushou. I'm impressed by your cunning, which is better than intelligence. You executed everything exactly as I planned it. You got rid of Adham and we reopened the cabaret, and gave up our dear friends. Hello, police? I want to report five escaped prisoners. -Is that so, Veranda? -Veranda? Is that so, Salluki? Is that so, Atwa? You... -Mansi. -Nancy. Did you love any of those bastards, Shoushou? Is that what you think, Ghazghaz? You only fall for the big boss. A special salute to the big boss!
