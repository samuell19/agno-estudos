AT PRESENT, 15 PRIESTS IN SPAIN ARE AUTHORISED TO PERFORM EXORCISMS. IN ORDER TO CARRY THEM OUT POSSESSION MUST FIRST BE VERIFIED BY THE VATICAN. THIS FILM IS FICTIONAL, INSPIRED BY STATEMENTS FROM THOSE INVOLVED IN RECENTLY DOCUMENTED CASES IN SPAIN. Lord Jesus. You are the bread of life, and we praise you for the food that you have given us mercifully. We thank you for life and for sustenance. You grant it us in your infinite mercy. Blessed be those who made it possible for us to receive it. Help those in need and may we all hunger and have thirst for you. -Amen. -Amen. Laura, your hair. Two for you, Jesus? Guess what I heard. Maria Luisa spent 400 euros on her daughter's communion dress. And her husband says he hasn't got any work. They're mad. Get anything for the the other day? That was just a favour. He paid for my petrol. Petrol doesn't fill the fridge, Tomas. Come on. Eat up. -Jesus... -I can do it myself. Let him do it himself. It takes longer to clean up than to feed him. I'd like some water. What's wrong with you? Nothing. You're not eating. I've been invited to a party tonight. What do you mean? It's for Halloween. Mireia's going. | don't care what Mireia's doing. Mum... | don't like these modern parties. -Please, they're counting on me. -So let them dis-count you. Can't you let her? | said no. MEET YOU AT THE SQUARE Laura... your pill. Don't stay up late, your mum wants to get up early for the cemetery and you'll be tired. Okay. -You know your mother and I love you. -Yes. We only want what's best for you. It won't be like the last time. Really, I promise. Come on. Get your pyjamas on and go to sleep. It's late. When you say your prayers, pray for your brother Adrian. Give me a kiss. The glass. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. She's watching you. Jesus. What are you doing up? Are you going to go...? Are you going to that party with Mireia that mum doesn't want you to go to? Promise me nothing will happen. | promise... You're the only one who gets me. Laura! Mireia! Where were you? You look much better in those clothes. There you go. Now you look perfect. Look at your boobs in that, you bitch. Come on, we're late and we need to get drinks. Wait! Where are you going? Aren't we going to a party at the club? We are, but first I've got a surprise. What? You'll see. | don't know, Mireia... | just want to have fun tonight. That's all I ask. And you will too, okay? | don't know why I let you do this. It's because you know that this is where it's at, babe. Because we're 17 and hot. Hang on. This place is really creepy. Good. It's Halloween. You're going to have so much fun. Come on, then. Hello? Hello? You're going to die tonight! Idiots! What's going on? Where the fuck were you? We thought you'd gone. We were ready to party. The Chinese lady wouldn't sell us the drink. I'm glad you got your friend out of the convent. Don't listen to this prick. Arturo, did you bring them? You're up for it, huh? You're an idiot. -Where are you going? -For a walk. Want some? You do drink, don't you? | don't know if it's a good idea. -You're... -What? I'm just saying | like the way you look. Thanks. Come on. Are you okay? You're shaking. Yes, yes. I'm just a bit nervous. Right. | know what will help you relax. What's going on here? -What's up, Don Juan? -Prick. Listen... We were thinking... Seeing as we're in his house and because it's Halloween, let's contact the doctor. Look what I found. Who's that? Laura, the doctor. You don't know the story? No. Okay. The doctor brought them here. He sat his three daughters on this sofa... and made them watch him stab his wife. Forty-seven times. He cut her open and pulled her guts out. Then... he strangled his daughters. The bastard put them out on the balcony for everyone to see and whistled a lullaby. -What a freak. -No, no, no. The doctor said it wasn't him. He said that the devil possessed him and forced him to kill them for being unchaste. Unchaste? Mireia's dead in that case, surely. The only one safe here would be Laura. Let's get him to tell us himself. Are you up for talking to the dead? -Le:. We're in. Right, Laura? Don't you need a board or something? What for? That's just in the films. We don't need... Hey, the degreaser. This is for you. Okay. To a terrifying Halloween. Let's hold hands, like good brothers and sisters. Now close your eyes and don't think about anything. Why? The spirits only come if you're relaxed. You're scared shitless, aren't you? Okay. Don't be afraid of the dead. If anyone's here, amongst us, reveal yourself. If anyone's here with us, show yourself now. If anyone's here... with us... we just want to make contact. Come. Come to us. Come... lost souls... Make contact. What did you say? Did you lose your voice or something? Arturo, this shit doesn't work. Wait a second. Something was missing. Wait. What the hell was that? Laura, babe... Laura... Babe. Stop, it's not funny. What the fuck are you doing? She's mental. Laura, stop it now. Laura, what the fuck are you doing? Stop it! Laura, please... Fuck! Where the fuck is she? Laura? Laura, please... Stop it right now, Laura. Laura! Laura, please, Laura... Laura, please. Who is it? What is it? -Laura! -We met up to go out and... -Did you do this? -No! She just drank a bit. You call this "a bit"? | hope you're happy! I'll be calling your parents tomorrow. Go home. What's all this? She'll get pneumonia. Pneumonia"s the least of my worries. Have you seen the state of her? How embarrassing! Pray! Ask for forgiveness for what you did tonight. -Don't you see what you've done? -Stop! What have you done? What have you done? -Carmen! -Once was enough for me, Tomas! | won't have it. | don't want this. Pray! Pray. Father... Pray! Father... -Father... -I'm to blame... -I'm to blame. -I ask for mercy. -I ask for mercy. -Forgive me my sins. Forgive me my sins. | come to you in absolute faith. | come to you in absolute faith... ...| know you favour penance. What are you doing? Keep praying. -No, please... -Continue. Water won't be enough to wash away your sins. | know you don't favour revenge. | know you don't favour revenge. -Or bitterness. -Or bitterness. Your heart is compassionate and full of mercy. Your heart is compassionate and full of mercy. And I know you want me to be humble and confess my sins. And I know you want me to be humble and confess my sins. Time to get up. We're going to the cemetery before mass. Don't you think I've forgotten about last night. We'll discuss your punishment. We'll go ahead. Your brother would have loved them. Come on. Laura. Come on! It's important we remember... -Go to confession. -...today on All Saints Day. Our Lord also experienced death. You're late. Your daughter. Hail Mary, full of grace. Conceived without sin. Tell me, child | have sinned, Father. | lied to my parents. And... And I did something I shouldn't have. A sin of the flesh? No. You're lying again. You didn't commit the sin of lust last night, Laura? Laura. Laura. Wait. Are you okay? What's the matter? Come here. Asuncion! How lovely to see you! Good to see you too, Carmen. Hello, Laura! | wanted to introduce Father Olmedo. He's the new priest here for the next few months. -Nice to meet you. -Asuncion's talked about you. She says you're an example to the community. -Prominent members of his Work. -We do what we can. And you? Won't I see you at confirmation? Of course you will. Right, darling? If you need anything, remember that the house of God is always open to his servants. Thank you, Father. Well, have a nice day. Laura, see you in class. -Goodbye. -Have a good day. Lau... Laura... What? Are you sick? I'm fine. | don't want what happened last time to happen again. Nothing's going to happen to me, okay? Shall I put the mattress on the floor and sleep by you? I'm scared. What are you scared of? The man you talk to. What man? | woke up last night... and you were talking to a man. | must have been talking in my sleep. He was answering you. | heard him. What was he saying? He said he was the doctor. And that he would never leave you. If you dedicated more time to contemplation, time in your day before a crucifix, you'd love Him as He loves us. We can demonstrate our love for Him with our actions so that evil does not triumph. We must not forget that our duty as Christians is to conquer evil. To talk to God you don't always have to look to heaven. You look gorgeous. Bowl Cut's hot, isn't he? Not everyone is able to help you. That's why I'm here. We have summer camps organised for you. Open your books to page 102. | want everything finished for tomorrow. Come on! We've got ten minutes for some writing. | want you to reflect on all the acts that distance you and that bring you closer to God each day. Is that clear? Okay. Come on, then. Ten minutes! Laura... Laura, where are you going? Okay, settle down. Come on, keep writing. Eh! Eh! What's going on? -You okay? -Yes. -You're bleeding. -It's fine. Better? I'm Lola, I'm the new psychologist. What's your name? I'd ask the headmaster but I don't know him very well yet. Laura Villegas. Great. Laura Villegas... Do you want to tell me what happened? Laura... | won't lie to you. Hitting a teacher is very serious and you could be expelled. Look. Anything you say stays between us. Unless I have your permission, | can't tell anyone. Not even your parents. We did a seance. And... And since that day... something's been harassing me. Something? Do you believe in hell? No, I don't. | do. And I'm scared I'm going there because of what I've done. No. Nothing you did at a seance will make you go to hell. It's just pretend. Nothing else. So I'm going crazy. All right, look. You tell me everything, and everything will be okay. | promise. You're going to be okay. I'd like to see you next week. Is that okay with you? Okay. Laura, don't be afraid. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our minds play tricks on us. Here's my phone number. You can call or text me at any time. Put it in your phone, okay? Thanks, Lola. You know what? I like your haircut. It's like the singer's from The Butterflies. It's cool. Laura... Hey! How are you? Would you like a ride home? No, no, I'd better not. If my mum saw me on a moped, she'd kill me. You can put this on. Yeah? There we go. Here, put it on. There we go... It's caught. -Okay? Too tight? -No. Okay, get on. Okay. -Okay? -Yes. Let's go, then. Stop! I should get off here. -Here? -Yeah, I'll get off here. -You live up there. -I know, I should walk the rest. -I'll take you to the door. -No, I'll get off here. Okay. Thanks. -Are you okay? -Yes. -Here. -See you tomorrow, yeah? See you tomorrow. -Bye. -Bye. Sorry. | don't know what happened. I'm worried about you. Are you here to tell my mum? Your mother's still upset about the other night. | warned you about Mireia. | hope you change your mind and that we see you at summer camp. You could learn from your brother. He always comes. He never complains about anything. Laura... We're all going to save ourselves. You've heard it said it so often that it feels like the truth. Right? Well, it's a lie. Do you think God's going to save you? Can I go home now? | was young once too. | was also tempted by boys. Lots, Laura. And do you know what God did? He punished me. He took my light away. My mother helped me realise that God was testing me... so I wouldn't give into temptations of the flesh. Don't be fooled by butterflies... or kind words. He's behind all of this. "And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: let there be weeping and gnashing of teeth."” That's the last time you get on that motorbike... Listen to your mother. Don't give us any more trouble. Come along. Laura! Laura! Open up! What's going on? Move! Laura! Open up! Oh my God! Darling! It's over, it's over. I'll pick you up from school tomorrow. -We're going to see Dr. Mosquera. -No, Dad, please, I don't want to. If you won't go for you, go for us and for your brother. Give me a kiss. Mum. Yes? Leave the light on in the hallway, please. The light on? What? Please leave it on. Don't turn it off. Okay. God Almighty, defend and protect me tonight from all danger and sin. Let the light of your love illuminate these hours of sleep. Protect all my loved ones, near and far. | beg you, Lord, visit this home... and deliver it from evil. | don't care about my own suffering, only that you look after and bless my loved ones with your love. Amen. LOLA, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU Michelangelo's pictorial work is characterised by a perfect anatomical drawing which heavily increases the volume and leaves the background undefined... Look at this. ...and the compositional expressiveness of foreshortenings. The first stage of his pictorial work, belonging to the Holy Family Doni, or Tondo Doni, from 1504 to 15086, shows idealised beauty through emphatic and volumetric compositions. This is Michelangelo's famous vendetta against Biagio da Cesana. He left him there, immortalised and ridiculed. -With a snake coiled round him... -You're a hot dude. ...and biting his genitals. Caronte. Those souls who could not pay had to wander the Acheron lagoons for 100 years until the boatman agreed to take them. Saint Bartholomew. According to ancient tradition, the apostle was martyred by the skinning of his leg. What the fuck are you doing, Bowl Cut? You can't be here. Don't you have toilets? | did you a favour. When they see how big your mouth is, you'll have all the guys. -Where am I? -You're in hospital. Breathe, breathe. Breathe through your nose. Slowly. Inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouth. That's it. -He's punishing me. -No, no one is, Laura. He's harassing me. The devil wants to kill me. -Yes. No. Listen to me. He doesn't exist. No demons, no angels, no heaven, no hell. They don't exist. Whatever's happening to you, it's in your head. The rest are all just things people tell themselves to make sense of what they don't understand. But... So... There's nothing when we die? | think that when we die... we just switch off. Like when you turn off a computer. Deep down, no one knows. When I die if... If there actually is something, can I come and tell you? You're not going to die. You're not going to die. Laura... Hi, I'm Lola, the school psychologist. Can we talk for a moment? It'll only take five minutes. How are you? | don't know how aware you are of the difficulties your daughter's been having. What difficulties? Laura's very frightened. She thinks that since doing the seance a demon is harassing her. My daughter told you she did a seance? Yes. Anyway, that's not what's important, Mrs Villegas. -I'm not listening to this nonsense. -Mrs Villegas. Mrs Villegas. -Mrs Villegas! -What is it? The seance isn't what's important... More importantly, since then she thinks that there's a demon controlling her body. -Jesus Christ... -Obviously, there's no demon. She's punishing herself because of certain religious beliefs. Who are you to judge us? -Listen to her! -Listen to what? That she's sick for believing in God? Laura! Laura! Get a doctor! -Call the doctor! -We need a doctor! Laura... We need you to stay still. It's very important you don't move, okay? This will only take a moment. Something's wrong. Stop the machine. Shut it down! -Laura Villegas' parents? -Yes. She's fine, don't worry. She had to have emergency surgery, but she's fine. Her body couldn't expel the crosses naturally and there was already a perforation, as you can see. We have to really watch patients like Laura. It's not unusual for them to ingest dangerous objects, blades or glass... -You should have been informed. -Sorry? | see from her records that she's been treated for anorexia and anxiety. Does this look like anxiety to you? No, no. Unfortunately, | think this is far more serious. So, do you know what's wrong with her? Well, a diagnosis can't he made until she's been re-evaluated. What for? To be told the same thing again and end up back here? I'm tired of this. Mr Villegas. How did she swallow them without injuring herself? | don't have an answer for that. I'm sorry. Excuse me. How is she? I'd like you to leave. -It's not a good time. -Tomas. You think you're helping her but you don't know how much harm you're doing. Let me know what happens, please. Mum... Mum... What is it? It's the devil. He says he won't leave me. -Thanks for coming so late. -There's no need to thank me. Asuncion already filled me in on everything. -Let me help you. -Thank you. I knew this was going to happen. | felt it the first moment I saw her. With your permission, I'd like to talk to her tomorrow, to confirm my suspicions. -What suspicions? -Tomas, let him explain. | believe that your daughter has been possessed by the devil. Carmen, | won't hear any more nonsense. Tomas, it's natural for you to react like this. It's simply proof of how much you love your daughter, and your duty as a parent. But my duty, Tomas, my duty is to go where you cannot go. Believe me, for the love of God, | know what I'm talking about. This isn't the first time I've seen a case like Laura's. | told you to call Father Olmedo as he's the only one who can help her. If I were to ask you... Well, I am asking you, how much do you know about exorcists? -Do they exist? -They do, Tomas. We do exist. The Vatican itself authorises our work. You're not touching my daughter! You do believe, don't you? You believe, you believe in God. You believe in God, don't you? Yes, I do. If you believe in God's mercy, why don't you believe in the hatred and evil of the devil? That hatred is now inside your daughter and will not leave her until we expel it... or it kills her. What if you're wrong? What if you're wrong? What if I'm not? Please, Tomas. -Listen to him, -Carmen, I won't listen to him. Please. No. -God's punishing us... -Stop it. What did you say? That's enough, Carmen. No priest, not God, nor anyone else can help us. -The only... -You've no shame. Let me finish. We're the only ones who can help Laura. -Do you hear me? -Don't shout. -I'll shout if I want to! -Fine, shout all you want. Doesn't change the truth. First, Jesus. Then Adrian and now the girl. Adrian, it was an accident. No. It wasn't an accident. We came off the road and lost a child. But it won't happen again. Not again, Tomas. Not again. Asuncion. The door, please. What's she doing? You need to request voluntary discharge. We can't do it here. We need somewhere where Laura feels safe. I'll wait to hear from you. Thank you. At home. Jesus can stay at your brother's. The Church, like a mother, has a very serious duty to procure peace for its children. And that includes, where necessary, practising exorcism. But you must not be afraid. God is by our side and all he asks for in return is our trust and faith in Him. And that faith must be unwavering if we want to help Laura. I have already spoken to the Bishop and I have his permission. No one will disturb us. It is imperative that you are aware: The devil knows how to corrupt us. He will do everything in his power to feed upon our weaknesses. That's why I ask that you be vigilant. God knows how to make us strong. How to save your daughter. Think of this as a fight. It will go on until he who is possessed loses consciousness. Which would signify that we are on the right track. How many exorcisms are necessary? That we don't yet know, but we shouldn't go beyond 13. Laura's body wouldn't be able to take it and we'd have to give up the fight. You're going to get better. Please go. Please go. He's here to help you. Mum, make him go, please. The Lord is your keeper, he is your shade... the sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. He keeps you from all evil and protects your life. The Lord will keep thy comings and goings from this time forth and for evermore. Where is she? Go and check the fuses. I'll get the torches. The Lord keeps thy comings and goings. The Lord protects your life! The Lord is your keeper... from this time forth and for evermore! -Laura! -From this time forth and for evermore! Laura! Is all this really necessary? It's wise in order to prevent further harm. Do whatever you have to, but return my child to me, please. Uncover her. Laura. No, Tomas. No! Stay away! Stay still or leave. If you want to help, pray with me. Laura, don't be afraid. You're not alone, I'm with you. Lord, King, Father unbegotten, true essence of God, have mercy on us. Lord, have mercy on us. Source of light, creator of all things, have mercy on us. Lord, have mercy on us. Drink, Laura. | need you to drink. Why are you hiding in this creature of God, you filthy beast? Manifest yourself. Manifest yourself! No, no, no! Laura... -He's here, isn't he? -Please! Leave me be! -He's here. -Please, leave me be! -He's here. -Please... -Please, leave me be! -I can help you, but it's you, -it's you who has to force him out. -No, no, no! -No, no, please. -Force him out! -No, no, please. -Force him out! No! That's enough for now. What's he doing? Spirits always come back. After every encounter, you must light a candle to guide them. Mireia? You're Enrique, right? -I'm Lola, the psycholo... -The school shrink. You must have your work cut out here. Can we talk for a moment? I've got English class. It's about Laura Villegas, | know you're friends. I'm in a hurry. I don't want to know. -Are you in a hurry too? -Yes. It's very important we talk, your friend's very sick and needs help. Sorry, I have to go. | know something happened when you were at the doctor's house. Christ, truest God, truest of men, have mercy on us. Christ, have mercy. Christ, the guiding light... for all things, have mercy on us. We must cleanse her soul. Lord, bless this water. | exorcise you... in the name of God, the Almighty Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, his Son, our Lord, with the power of the Holy Spirit, to drive away the strength of the enemy, by virtue of Jesus Christ our Lord, who will come to judge the living and the dead. Amen. It's burning me, it burns! Have mercy, Lord, repentance and penance! Father, she's drowning. Have mercy, Lord, repentance and penance! Have mercy, Lord, repentance... and penance. She's drowning. She can't breathe. Tomas... Manifest yourself. Manifest yourself. Manifest yourself! Were you looking for me, priest? The Lord is your keeper, he is your shade, the sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. He keeps you from all evil, and protects your life. The Lord will keep thy comings and goings from this time forth and for evermore. The Lord is your keeper. He keeps you from all evil! He keeps and protects you from all evil! Almighty God... Laura! Laura! Laura! In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit! My strength resides in the name of the Lord, creator of Heaven and Earth. -Mum, he's hurting me. -Don't listen to her. Move aside. Carmen, Tomas, move aside! Move aside and pray with me. -Mum... -Have mercy, Lord, repentance and penance. Have mercy on this creature's wails and tears and on all those who are present here imploring your glory and mercy. Glory and mercy? He abandoned you! | renounce and go before the almighty and ineffable God Satan! | renounce the false God Jehovah, | renounce his vile, despicable son Jesus Christ, and I renounce his rotten Holy Spirit... | adjure you, Satan, enemy of human salvation, acknowledge the justice and goodness of God our Father. Acknowledge the power and might of Jesus Christ, who overcame you in the desert, prevailed in the garden and stripped you on the cross. Back away from this creature who, at birth... Our Father, in Heaven... ...dying acquired it with his blood! Daddy... Please... | need you. Adrian? Come here. Tomas, no. Daddy... Son... You left me all alone. You didn't watch me. No... I'm sorry. | died because of you. -Don't say that, please. -Yes. I'll be drowning forever, I'm still drowning. Please... | don't care about what you are telling me! | don't care! I can't! | can't see her like that! I can't! If anyone inside that room doesn't believe in what we're doing, we'll have lost Laura forever. Carmen, please! She's my daughter! She's my daughter. That was the 11th. You don't want to lose her, do you? Mr Villegas? I've been trying to contact you but it's been impossible. What are you doing here? | came to your house, but no one answered, | saw you coming out of the door. | came out to buy some food. Tomas, please. Where's Laura? Is she in a different hospital? Listen to me. Enrique confessed to me that they put drugs in her drink. Laura was drugged and drugs can have terrible effects on certain people. Your daughter doesn't have a demon inside her, your daughter is sick. If you'd seen what I've seen... Tomas... | command you, in the name of God, what is your name? | command you in the name of Jesus Christ! What is your name? What is your name? You filthy beast! Tell me your name! What is your name? Never! | command you! What is your name? | command you in the name of Jesus Christ! What is your name? What is your name? Lucifer. Praise the Lord. Now we know, it's Satan himself. It's there. It's that doorway. Stand down, Lucifer! In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Stand down by the faith and prayer of the Church... that lives and reigns forever and ever. You ruined everything. You ruined everything. You ruined everything. What have you done, Tomas? Save my daughter. What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? Dad... | wish I had been better. No! No! Laura! And that's all I can tell you. Okay, thank you. You can't believe them. Whatever they told you, you can't believe it. That girl was sick and she was harassed. Read the report. If it can be proved, they will be tried. Don't you worry. -LOLA, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. -SORRY, MY PHONE WAS TURNED OFF. HI, LAURA. WHERE ARE YOU? CALL ME, I'M WORRIED. | WANT TO TALK TO YOU. IT'S URGENT. CALL ME IF YOU CAN. RECORDING VOICE MESSAGE Lola... Lola... Lola, help me. EXORCISMS CONTINUE TO BE PERFORMED IN SPAIN TO THIS DAY. THIS FILM IS FICTIONAL, IT DOES NOT TRULY REPRESENT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CASES THAT WERE THE SOURCE OF ITS INSPIRATION
