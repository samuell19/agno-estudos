None of what I have told you has been picked up by the press. It will. In fact, until the Guild sorts it out, this picture is officially directed by nobody. We are unofficially scheduled to screen at Venice, which the rational thought might be to pull out, but if we were to do that, between the official un-director and the unofficial withdrawal from the unofficial Venice selection, what we'd wind up with is a very fucking official disaster.

Sound speed. Marker. Action. I forgot my key. It's like A Place in the Sun. Love means never having to say... - You're sorr... - Cut. Cut! Sure, it's exactly like A Place in the Sun, except that he isn't Montgomery Clift, that's not Elizabeth Taylor, - and Arthur... - Action. God love him, sure as hell isn't Mr. Stevens. I forget my key. George Stevens? Do you know George Stevens? I'm sorry. A little. Don't. Dotty Langer. Love means never having to say... - Cut! - I'm cutting this... - Allie! - What? - Movie. - You're saying "never"! - Cutting? - The line is "not ever"! - I can't work with... - I'm the editor. - It's the same thing! - Love means... Editor. Not ever! Okay. Then say it right! Okay! It's the same thing! Holy shit! Quiet on set! Had to see it for myself. Place in the Sun, meet Red River. You look like a fuckin' monk! They call me Viking Man. Vikar. Good to meet you, Vicar. His name's John. He's writing a western for Huston. - Love means never. - John Huston? - Having to say you're sorr... - Cut! Cut! Allie! The line is "not ever"! It's the same thing! It's not, you're saying "never"! It's... I don't, I don't understand. You keep saying "never". I... Over and over. No, I... You still think it's like A Place in the Sun? - No. - It's a shit line, anyway! I'm not shooting til Bob's here! Bob's the new head of production. Bob needs to pork her in her tight little Wellesley ass, then maybe she'll get the line right! John has a charming perspective. You surf man, you surf? No, I don't surf. Hey Viking Man, hey! Miss McGraw wants you to get the fuck outta here! Well, tell Miss McGraw to learn her fucking lines. Get the fuck outta here! Fuck you. Somebody get me Bob! Why don't you go buy another cream colored jacket, tubby? What'd you say, Viking Man? Love means not ever having to say you're sorry, even I fucking got it by now, Jesus! - Piece of shit! - This is ridiculous! I'm off this movie! Have fun with this turkey, good luck! Somebody get me fucking Bob! I'll pick you up this weekend, okay? We'll hit the beach. I don't surf. Gotta get out of the office sometimes, Vikar! He senses an untapped reservoir of psychosis. Makes him all wet. So cute. Room 928, please. Okay, room 928. Okay. $40 a night. $40. Well... I'll have it for one night. Okay. Montgomery Clift stayed in this room. Who's McGoverly Cliff? Hey, Vikar... joint's there in the glove box. Pass me one, would you? There's a gun in here. It's a .45. Feel free to point it, just not at me. So, why that one? Which one? Place in the Sun, why? It's the first movie I ever saw. What, when you were a kid? No, 11 months ago. You fuckin' kidding me? Not fucking kidding. Jesus fucking Christ, Vikar! Movies are a goddamn birthright! They show them to fuckin' prisoners! Did you grow up in a goddamn cave in Cambodia or something? No, a seminary. In Philadelphia. Holy shit, you keep getting better and better, Vikar. So, what happened? So you see the Stevens picture, you have a fucking psychotic break, you go to the first tattoo parlor you can find? I think it's a very good movie. And I had a dream. We all do, Vikar. We all do. I can't be the next Howard Hawks, because I can't do screwball comedies or musicals. I know my limits, Vikar. So... I got to settle for being the next John Ford, and there you have it in a scrotum sack. What I'm settling for, all these pussies would kill for! I'm too overpowered. Where are they gonna go after me? Francis, Marty, this fucking giant space robot guy? Goddammit! Mister big game. - Who? - Or Hitchhike Kong. He doesn't want to be John Ford. He wants to be Alfred Hitchcock. Bon jour, assholes! This is the Vikar. He builds churches. He's an autistic, which means he lives and breathes movies, and I'm pretty sure he's a virgin! That movie sucks. It looks like shit. Well I got about a dozen East Coast critics that would say otherwise. That's great. There's a scene where a robot jerks off a guy. They're droids! They're droids, okay? They're droids? They're not robots, they're droids? - They're sentient beings. - Oh, I'm sorry. - You shut the fuck up, okay? - Okay, okay, okay. Fine, fine. What is everyone working on right now? What is your next project? I got this new idea. It's a modern Batman as a taxi driver who roams the streets saving prostitutes. It's much better way than I use prostitutes. Is he like plucking them off the street and giving them a new home? How the fuck are you gonna make a movie about something other than the war? That's all that's fucking happening right now! - What are you workin' on? - Hey, hey! What, what, what? I got an idea about this... great white shark that terrorizes a town, like a New England town. Robot shark. - Robot shark. - Robot shark. Fucking robot! What the fuck is wrong with you? Why's everything have to be a goddam robot? You two can't make movies together anymore! No sharing ideas! - Shut the fuck up! - They're droids! They're sentient beings! I'm gonna shoot this motherfucker in the face. Gonna need more booze! Want a drink? I've never had alcohol before. Well you should try it. It's fucking fantastic. Who's that? Ha. Soledad? Where do I start? Rumor has it her father is Bunuel illegitimately. She spent some time in nuthouse. She was cast, actually, as the woman who vanishes in L'Avventura, but they replaced her at the last second. Someone once told me she's a witch! And that, 20 minutes down the sand from here, she gave Coppola's friend, Jim Morrison, the blowjob of a lifetime, channeled from the fuckin' netherworld or something like that. The whole bottle? You're gonna feel that. I wanna talk to her. Well, no time like the present. Seize the moment! Hi. Are you an actress? Yes. What movies are you in? Nothing important. Just a few European movies. I'm sure they're very good movies. Are you a gangster? Did I know you... a long time ago? Sleep it off, Vikar. Why you! What's the matter with you? Oh boy you! Murray, say somthing' nitwit! Where are you? What are you lookin' at? Your hair. I think it saved you. Man, look in the mirror if you wanna see some freaky shit. Clifton and Taylor in the terrace scene from A Place in the Sun tattooed on this white mother fucker's head staring at my head. That's what it actually is. Ah, hey man! Sunset Boulevard! Apotheosis of Hollywood's golden age. I believe it's a very good movie. One of the greatest movie openers of all time. You got the dead man floating in the pool, telling a story from beyond the grave. Hey, you know, Montgomery Clift was supposed to play Joe Gillis. Really? Billy Wilder wrote the part for him. And Monty pulled out at the last minute, claiming the role was too close to his own life. Hey, you see the little butler, man? Yeah. He's one of the most talented directors of his time. He was? Erich von Stroheim. He also directed her, Gloria Swanson, when she was young. Queen Kelly. Queen Kelly. And that's exactly what they're watching right there. - A movie within a movie. - Mm-hm. Nothing else. Just us. And a camera. And those wonderful people out there in the dark. - All right, Mr. DeMille. - All right, Mr. DeMille. - I'm ready for my closeup. - I'm ready for my closeup. You work in movies, man? I build sets. Ah, I can dig that. This one of yours? Looks like a church. That's not for a movie. I built that in divinity school. Oh, man! My Darling Clemintine! Ho ho! Apex of Ford's art, you feel me? I feel you. Some people think it's The Searchers, which is no doubt one wicked, badass movie whenever my man The Duke is on screen, evil white racist honky pig fucker that he his, but give me Clementine anytime. I'm gonna let you go. But I don't want you to break into my house anymore. Okay. Okay. Hey man... You mind if I... hang out for a little while? I'm tired. Oh, go to sleep, man. I'm just gonna sit here and hang with my man, Henry Fonda. - Okay. - All right. You are going into the services, aren't you? Yes, ma'am. When you watch movies, do you ever dream? What are you gettin' on about now? Nothing. This is all wrong. These elements are from different time periods. This arch is from 23 years later, when the character of the prostitute dies of consumption. Excuse me? In 23 years, the prostitute will die of consumption under this arch. Elvira? Joe. Have I received the latest changes for the Man of La Mancha script? It's not in the script. I'm sorry. What are you talking about? It takes place 23 years after the script. Not on my set! Change it! I hear you've been vexing them over in set design? I vex people. Come on in. Come and sit down here. I've set up A Place in the Sun for you. A Place in the Sun. I worked on it. Do you know what an editor does? Puts the scenes in order because they were shot out of order. That's the first thing. Now watch this. I love you. I've loved you since the first time I saw you. Jesus. Is that the sexiest moment in the history of the movies? I love you. Are they watching us? No other man could have given himself over to this scene the way Monty does. Hold you next to me. Between Liz and Monty, none of the closeups match. In terms of sheer continuity, it's all fucked up. Stevens is going for rhythm! And intimacy, pure and simple. If I could only tell you all. Tell Mama. Tell Mama all. Fuck continuity. Yeah. Fuck continuity. Will you teach me how to edit? Sure. That's what I'm doing. The one over on the left. Yeah, yeah, that one. It's good. It's good. Hello? - Hello? - Vikar, my man! You sound far away? Yeah, 'cause I'm in the fucking depths of the Philippines! Good surfin' here! But look, this call's expensive, so I'm gonna get right to it. I need you to come down here for a couple months. What? I wrote a nightmarish war film. Napalm, wild armies, drugs, the heart of fuckin' darkness! We need need someone to put her up together while we're shootin' if we're gonna hit our schedule. Dotty says you've got a hell of an eye. You got a passport, son? Passport, no. Of course you don't. That'll take an extra day, but we can do it! No, I can't leave. Why the fuck not? I don't... I don't want to leave Hollywood. Jesus Christ, Vikar, I love you, but you're being a fuckin' pussy right now. Don't you understand? This is Hollywood. What do you mean? This godforsaken stretch of jungle is fuckin' Hollywood! Manila's Holltwood, Paris, Tokyo, fuckin' Norway! The only place that isn't Hollywood is fuckin' Hollywood! Now get your ass over here! Vikar! One minute! Are you going somewhere? Philippines. Right now? She's getting big. Yeah, they do that. Well, it looks like your career is really taking off. Mine is going absolutely nowhere. You're going nowhere? Well... I mean, I'm here, auditioning for a part in The Long Goodbye. But I don't think I'll get it. If I made all the movies, I'd put you in every single one. Vikar. There you are. Good to see you. - I made it. - Yeah. Here's the story. We're shooting for eight months. Everything grinds to a fuckin' halt when the big guy shows up. Last Tango in Paris, The Wild One, Streetcar Named Desire. Yeah, the man himself. Shh, shh, shh. Marker. Action! Okay, I'll think of adding more dialogue. We'll see. What's going on? Marlon's being Marlon. All right, stop! Okay, Marlon. I just need you to say the dialogue. It's T.S. Eliot. Good enough for most people, but go ahead, paraphrase it, do what you have to do. Please! T.S. Eliot was my idea. I don't want to die in the jungle, Marlon. I don't want to die in the jungle! Now let's go! Action! The eyes are turned from in sleep, and demise of the castle that disappears. You see them, the light from a battered beam. Further and more dignified than they dying sun. Vikar! My man! What have you got for me? I cut together the battle sequence that you guys shot yesterday. Let's see it. Oh hell, Dotty was right. The Stevens kid's got a hell of an eye. I don't know what the hell you're doing, but it's working, son. Fuck continuity. That's right, fuck it. Have you seen Vampiros Lesbos? Soledad's masterpiece, yeah, I've seen it. I don't think it's a very good movie. You'd be spot fuckin' on about that one. Jesus Christ! You're still hung up on her, Vikar? She's unpredictable, she's unreliable. She's actually crazy. She was institutionalized in Scandinavia. I told you about that. This. The work, Vikar. This you can depend on. You're good at this shit, you're really good at it. There's something different. Keep it up, Vikar. Mr. Vikar, telephone. Hello. Mr. Jerome, do you know who I am? No. I'd like to fly you to New Work, work on a project. Can you tell me about it? It's a new film, it's very delicate. It stars Vic Thorn, Soledad Paladin. Do you know who she is? Yes. How far is New York? What? Just get over here. Flying from LA. Mr. Jerome. Your head precedes you. Mitch Rondell. President of production. Call me Vikar with a K. None of what I've told you has gotten out to the press, but it will. In fact, until the Guild sorts it out, this picture is officially directed by nobody. We are unofficially scheduled to screen events, which brings us to you. Viking Man says you're very good. We're more than willing to match what you currently make and increase that by 25%. 27%. 31%. Done. I'm not working on anything right now. Okay, back to 25%. I will edit your movie. Great! We didn't have to do all this talking, did we? Welcome aboard. Boo. So... You are editing my film. Yeah. I didn't know until Rondell told me. I've been watching you for weeks. I play the model's friend. Yes, I know. I auditioned for the model. They should have cast you. I was also supposed to play the gangster's girlfriend in The Long Goodbye. The scene with the Coke bottle. And at the last second, the director decided that nobody would smash my face with a Coke bottle. The director, Robert Altman, M♪A♪S♪H, Brewster McCloud, McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Yeah, him. Maybe it's a good thing that I didn't do it, though, because I talked to him like a year later, and he said that that actress went to a party, her boyfriend took LSD, bit her nose off, jumped out a window and died. Could have been me. And your nose. And my nose. Where's your daughter? She's in LA with friends. She's a big girl now. Are you doing anything right now? Let's go dancing.

You can fall in love with whoever you want, sleep with whoever you want, live happily ever after as often as you want. Liz would understand more than anybody. Dotty? When you were working on A Place in the Sun, did you know what it was gonna be? You mean did I know it was gonna be great? Yeah. Of course not. You didn't? Young man, most pictures, they come and they go. A really good picture, like... say Casablanca. Casablanca. They seem to live beyond the time they're made, and then a few sublime, perfect pictures, like The Third Man, The Shop Around the Corner, that silent film Joan of Arc, they seem to live before they're even made. The movie's in all times, and all times are in the movies. Yeah, sure. But the making of any movie is always in the here and now. I see. I love you, Dotty. I love you too, honey. Take care. You know what, I have to make a quick stop. Here's fine. I'll be right back. Where are you going? It'll be just a second. I'll come with you. No, no, no. You hold the cab. I'm gonna be right back. I always loved you. Hello? Vikar, you are behind schedule. Are you fucking around on me? I've been, uh... I'm having a gig at my house tomorrow. Get your ass there! That's it! You got it? I always loved you. What does he want to talk about? I don't know. I don't want to be here. Vikar! Get over here. You're here with Soledad? Yeah. You think you have a chance with her? I'm the producer. You're a fucking editor. You know what the joke in Hollywood is? The Polish girl is so stupid she sleeps with the writer. But even the Polish girl isn't stupid enough to sleep with the editor! What does an editor do? You just sit there and snip, snip, snip, snip. I'm the producer! I'm getting shit done. Did you put the sex scene in, huh? No. I shot that sex scene! I don't think it's a very good scene. You don't think it's a very good scene? That took me a week and a half to shoot that, and I used three cameras for that! I'm not putting in that scene. You put that scene in! I'm not putting the scene in! Put that scene in, you hear me? That's the only reason why she's in the movie. Do you think people want to see her act? You want to see who gets the girl? We'll see who gets the girl. All right, everybody! Out by the pool!

I like watching you die, because I can bring you back to life. Well I don't think the movie would make very much sense if you did that. The movie's really saved you, huh? I feel like I've known you a very long time. What's it gonna be like next week? All summer long? You have Joan of Arc's eyes. When I was young, I felt like Joan of Arc. What do you mean? They put me in a hospital when I was a teenager. They tried to erase who I was. The hospital was in Oslo, Norway. Oslo. What? I saw, I saw, I saw! What? On the screen. I saw you in Joan of Arc again. You were burning. Oslo. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay now. You told me something about Oslo. Shh, it's okay. Gentlemen. Watch this right here. I directed this scene. Something else, huh? Oh, it gets better. Three cameras. You killed the movie! Vikar, what are you doing here? You killed my movie! Scene's not over. Continue watching, gentlemen. It's all right. Hey, Mike. Really liking the way that disco movie is looking. Who's that fella, John Travalina? Those moves! Really fun! What the fuck are you doing? That's my executive team in there! You stole my movie! It's not your movie! It's my movie, and I hired you to do it! It's not finished yet! Well if I waited on you, Cassavetes, it'd take 10 years! It's art! - It's art! - It's not art! It's art, it takes time! Shut up! Stop saying it's art! So I'm fired? I brought on Walter Merch. He's a very smart editor, very hip. I know who he is. Even he doesn't get it, all right? He watched the first 10 minutes and thought you were completely incompetent! But by the time he got to the end, he said no, that wasn't it. So I asked him, I said, "What are you saying to me?" "Is he a genius?" He said, "No, of course not." "There are no geniuses." Billy Wilder. Sunset Boulevard. Shut up! "But what I am telling you is that" "he's editing in a way that I've never seen done before," "so we should stick with it." "Otherwise, we ruin the aesthetic continuity of the piece." Fuck continuity! Would you shut up? To answer your question, Vikar with a K, you're not fired, at least not for now. Just go finish it! Hey. Hey! Leave the Soledad thing alone. For your own good. Actresses... They're nothing but trouble. You know what, can you go right here please? You stay here, you keep the cab. I'll be right back, okay? Hold on. Just stay right here. I'll be right back. - Love you. - Soledad! What are you doing here? This is how you treat your daughter? Stop, stop. Stop! Stop! Zazi! Stop it! You're scaring her, stop! Get out. I'm okay. You're both staying with me. A - murder has been reported from one of those great big houses in the 10,000 block. You will read about it in late editions, I'm sure. You'll get it over your radio and see it on television. Because an old time star is involved. One of the biggest. But before you hear it all distorted and blown out of proportion. Before those Hollywood columnists get their hands on it. Channel 2. Good morning.

WCBS TV is owned by CBS Incorporated and operated by the CBS Television Safety Division. The programs broadcast by this station are for viewing by the public without charge and may not be rebroadcast, recorded, or otherwise used without the prior written permission of CBS Incorporated.

I watched Casablanca after you fell asleep. It was pretty cool. I believe it's a very good movie. Except for this one thing. In the end, Bogart gives this big speech about... you know, why they can't be together, and they have to do what's right, and that her place is with her husband. And then he says, "Some day you'll understand that." And that really pissed me off! Because she understood the whole time. It's why she left him in the first place. She spent the entire movie trying to get him to understand, and now he's telling her? It's bullshit! I think you're right. I think I'm right too. Hello. - Mr. - Rondell's assistant. Sorry for the interruption. What's wrong? I have a message from Soledad Paladin. She had to leave town. She's gone? Yes. She's taking hiatus with her daughter and won't be returning to New York.

I'll have my assistant get in touch with you with all the details. Everyone listen up. Your Pale Blue Eyes is going right to Venice. I always loved you. I still love you. Where are the buttons? There are no buttons. Where are the buttons? That's not my name. That's not my name. I'm setting the record straight. My name is Vikar with a K! How do you feel about A Place in the Sun? I believe it's a very good movie. What are some of your other favorites films? I believe Belle Du Jour is a very good movie. I believe the Passion of Joan of Arc is a very good movie. I believe The Third Man and The Shop Around the Corner are sublime movies that existed before they were made! The Searchers, which is a wicked badass movie whenever The Duke is onscreen, evil white racist honky pig fucker though he may be! I'm just trying to set the record straight! Do you think they got the part about my name? I'm sure. Mr. Jerome! I've been reading in the trades what you said to the press. It was only this morning. Well, news travels fast, Vikar. They got my name wrong. I'm not talking about your name, Vikar. In Hollywood, it's important that they're straight on the name. Well in Hollywood, you know what they're straight on, Vikar? The fact that you're a lunatic. And by lunatic, I mean that no one can figure out what you're gonna do next. And they don't want to miss out on it. Do you understand what I'm getting at? Have you seen Soledad and Zazi? What's that? Soledad! Oh, yeah. You know, she's just doing her thing. Do you know if she's all right? Don't you worry about Soledad. She's a survivor, all right? Oh, and by the way, my condolences on Dotty Langer. What? That editor. I know she was important to you. There's someone at the door. Oh! Good! That's you present. I got you something special to celebrate. Enjoy yourself. It's gonna be a great night. Rondell send me. Vikar! The conquering hero returns! Get over here! You were right, the editor can save a movie. I was wrong, and I'm never wrong. Get in here. Come here, come here. Ah! Good to see you. Have a seat. Please. So, what's next? What are we gonna do next? - Soledad. - Soledad. Viker. Come on, not this again. That's not gonna happen. I want to see Soledad. Listen. I consider you a friend, all right? We can talk, 'cause we're friends. We've been through a lot, but we're friends. Soledad's living here with me. She's here. She's here? No, she's not here right now here. But I mean, she's here. We're... We're living together. Where's Zazi? Zazi's here too. Vikar! Hey! Vikar! Come on! Hi. Hi. I want you to promise me something. What? If anything ever happens to me, you'll take care of my little girl. I promise. This is a very weird movie. Yes. See you in the movies, Vikar. Today we gather to grieve the loss of our lovely Soledad. If I had to say one thing about Soledad and one thing only, I would say this. She was the light of my life. And I was the light of hers. I can say that with extreme confidence. She was a unique individual, a true one in a million. Unfortunately, she never found - that one movie. - I'm sorry. That one quintessential piece of work that would show off her artistic talents. Just listen to this asshole. Then again, what is talent? Anyone really know? I know she had many physical talents that she shared with many, many people. It's just a cliche. You know all of it. And I know that I'm a cliche. The precocious, bitter teenager. Where've you been? I've been working. Making music with some friends. Can I help you? Somewhere that we'll probably never know. Only she knew. All I can say and all I can hope... Can I come stay with you for a while.

All the others have played for a while. It's your fault, you know. I would've never seen Patti Smith at CBGB if you hadn't taken mom there. Keep your mouth shut and empty your pockets. Nice and slow. Okay. Oh, man! A Place in the Sun! Yo, it's me! My Darling Clementine? Sunset Boulevard? What's it been, five, six years? 11 years. Oh, man! See any good movies lately? The Long Goodbye, Robert Altman. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Stony detective, I can dig it. Real cool. You see Scorsese's latest? Taxi Driver? No, man! Raging Bull! Oh, you got to see that one! That's all I can tell you. It's... It's like a opera for boxing. It's about the confusion of white folks, how they think they all civilized and shit, arias playing overhead, all while they beat the shit outta other folks, black folks! White America needs to see who the are, the animal inside! 'Cause they all a bunch of raging bulls trying to keep the Black Panther down! In the end, DeNiro gets the shit beat outta him by Sugar Ray! Okay? "You never got me down, Ray." "You never got me down." Is this a robbery or a movie review. I don't know. How much you got on you? Like $138. You think I could just get the $38? I'm pretty strapped. Take the $100. Ah, man. Get to see a movie. You know what? For a freaky white boy, you are okay. Thank you. Oh, and kudos on Venice. I saw the article in Variety. Thank you. Hey. Take care, Sid and Nancy. Do you want gold? Yes. This is fucking weird. What? It's fucking weird. I like it though. Oh my god! He's melting his poop. Is that poop perfume? You can change yourself into gold. Did you see that? What? What, Vikar? Come on. - No, we can't just leave... - Shh! Okay. Gosh. So loud. Vikar, we can't go up here! Vikar! What are you doing? Run! Run! Hey. I heard you were looking for a print of Joan of Arc. Did you find what you were looking for? No. I was sure I saw this image in the film years ago. But whatever you saw was not the real passion of Joan of Arc. What do you mean? It was a substitute. The original vanished in 1928. Dryer was able to reassemble it using outtakes and bits and pieces from a print that he had. Joan of Arc is a masterpiece, but it's made up of leftovers. Where's the real film? It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. But there are rumors that an original cut of the film circulated mental institutions. Mental institutions? The rumor was that the head of an institution bought it and showed it to patients in Oslo, Norway. Oslo? My mom always took me here. I want to show it to you. It's like from my dream. Get a parking spot in front of the screen. But not too close, otherwise it'll be hard to see. It'll be dark soon. Vikar! Come back! Where are you going? Vikar! Come back! They put me in a hospital when I was a teenager. It was in Oslo. Soledad? Soledad! Ah! Ah ha ha! Ah! Zazi, Zazi. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. You're fucking nuts, just like my mom! No, I found the image! Oh, fuck off, Vikar! - Come back with me... - Fuck off! Woo! I want to dedicate this to a real motherfucker!

Monty? That tattoo is fantastic. I never expected to be on the back of somebody's head. I think it's a very good movie. Your face, it's all better. Yeah, it's better. Was it bad? How's that? The accident. Did it hurt? Yeah, it was bad. Can't pretend it wasn't. Liz, she... She saved my life. Elizabeth Taylor? She reached into my mouth and pulled my teeth out of my throat. She's the only reason I didn't choke to death. Yeah. Gave her the teeth later as a keepsake. You gave her the teeth? You really should have a drink. Am I possessed? Am I possessed by the movies? Just because you love something doesn't mean it loves you back. Why me? Is it really just you? There's a secret movie that's been hidden in all the movies ever made. Who made it? Who put it there? The secret movie, the one that's hidden frame by frame in all of the other movies. Yeah. Perhaps someone is showing you a way out. Or a way in. I'm so tired I know. I haven't slept. I know. For days. It's been longer than that. Since before you came to Hollywood. Since before you ever went to the movies. Yes. Since you were just a little boy. Yes. You must sleep now. She's waiting for you. The most beautiful woman in the world is waiting for you to come to her right now. This morning. I should probably call the police. You probably should. Oh, Vikar. Never got your place in the sun, did you? Penny. For what? For your thoughts. Highest prices paid. I was just wondering why you invited me tonight. Oh, 'cause of my reasons. Good evening, Miss Vickers. Good evening. Good evening, Miss Vickers. Monty Clift is so beautiful. Liz Taylor's not too bad herself. This is the best scene in the whole movie. Aren't you happy with me? Happy? The trouble is I'm too happy tonight. Stop, wait stop, stop the film! I'm warning you, Zazi! It's gonna burn! It's so deep and far away. Why am I doing this? Shh!
