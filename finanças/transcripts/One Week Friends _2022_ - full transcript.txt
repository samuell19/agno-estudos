Listen to me, guys Last night, I had another dream about the end of the world So? This one was especially clear Exactly the same as what I had read in the magazine You're repeating your final year How do you still have time for magazines? Shut up According to the Maya Calendar, the earth will meet its end in the 5216th year And that... will be the end of the world Wait a minute, since that will happen 5216 years later, what does it have to do with us right now? You idiot It's calculated according to the Maya Calendar The earth can only exist for 5216 years The last day... will be Dec. 21st, 2012 What? Right in this year? Exactly Then what will happen, Xiaonan? There are a few possibilities The first is a meteor strike The second is a sulfur acid rain All cellphones, electric devices, and computers will break down Does that mean the College Entrance Exam will be cancelled? In your dreams We'll still have to take the exam What's that? Run! Where are we going? NO Ah! Youshu Youshu Couldn't you leave me alone for a while, Song Xiaonan? I was sleeping How dare you throw a ball at me, Xu Youshu? On your feet Just forget it On your feet Just let it go Everybody just calm down You don't have to wait till the end of the world Today will be the end of your life Xu Youshu, get on your feet What are you doing? Keep quiet Dear class, today I'm going to introduce a new student Here, please come to the podium This student just transferred to Shenghua Senior Repeating Class from another school Her name is Lin Xiangzhi Please welcome her with a warm clap Hello, everyone, I am Lin Xiangzhi All the students down there are going to become your friends who will keep you company day and night Come on Take a seat over there Sir, Xu Youshu is playing basketball in class again Song Xiaonan Stop there You Xu Youshu, what is your problem? Song Xiaonan, how can you try to frame a classmate? Have you got any idea of the urgency? How come you just won't concentrate? Do you want to take the College Entrance Exam or not? Xu Youshu, go and clean the gym warehouse after the noon break go and clean the gym warehouse Song Xiaonan, you'll have to clean the library Three days in a row Sir, it was his fault No, it was she Knock it off End of this question Let's move on with our lessons First we'll go over what we learned in the last class We've learned the trigonometric function of acute angles, which is a function with the variation of acute angles, and the functional value of ratios Song Xiaonan With mushrooms and pork You know what Song Xiaonan made such an accurate hit Hey, by the way, I suppose if you're really going to start a fight, you would be no match for her I gave her a break just because she would be my elder brother's wife What are you talking about? Song Xiaonan has a crush on you Everybody in our class knows it Just mind your own business The whole morning, you just couldn't take your eyes off the transfer student You think I've never noticed that? Don't talk nonsense She was the one that kept looking at me So, is that supposed to be love at first sight? Even if you call it love at first sight, she's the one that set it up Last week I just watched a movie about love at first sight Here it is Trust me It's really amazing That's it? Hey, don't underestimate it This is the guide book of puberty romance for millions of girls Jiang Wu, do you need to borrow a DVD? I can help you with that No, thanks. I've already got it I haven't finished reading "A little thing called love" You're repeating your final year How can you indulge yourself in romantic stuff like that? You've gone too far This is Jiang Wu's DVD That's so sweet But we're still students now I think study is our foremost priority No, it was Youshu that wanted this DVD Zip it That's nonsense It was really Youshu Song Xiaonan, the next time you want to start talking trash, could you please take the audience's feelings into consideration? For what purpose would Xu Youshu borrow a DVD like this? It's like a blossom on an iron tree All right, I'm an iron tree But you're just a dry tree with no sprouts You're calling me a dry tree? Yeah I'll make your tears dry How come you always start fighting every time you meet each other? You threw a ball at me in class I haven't got even with you for that How's that? Isn't it awesome? Of course it is I've learned a few tricks in the DVD you've recommended Check it out You can do this Go! Lin Xiangzhi, here's bottle of orange juice A humble gift of sincerity I wonder if we can become good friends? I'll help you put the straw in My clothes are damp Juice stained damn I, I Hey Lin Lin Lin Xiangzhi I didn't mean to do that Wait a second Lin I'm so sorry Give me a chance to say sorry Ah! Are you all right? What is your problem? How could we be all right? We were almost knocked over Lin Xiangzhi, just tell me if he dares to bully you again I'll make him pay Read after me Okay? Everything that happened that night was obliberated from her memory Everything that happened that night was obliberated from her memory Stay in sync, okay? One, two, begin Everything that happened that night was obliberated from her memory Dear Xiangzhi I am Youshu Let's go to the movies Shall we? One, two, begin! Sir, Xu Youshu just disturbed a classmate with a note Xu Youshu, it's you again! Can't you just behave yourself and listen carefully? Yes, Madam Don't laugh Lin Xiangzhi Go, go, go Well, this is for you Hey, Lin Xiangzhi Wait a second The stupid thing I did was just a mistake I'm not some kind of weirdo or nerd I just want to know you better I have got this thought since the first day you transferred to this school So, please read this letter Hold your horses Youshu just wants to be friends with her No way Hey, don't go there All right I'll wait for a bit longer I'd like... I'd like to be your friend What do you mean? Have I told you that I need you to be my friend? I don't wanna be friends with you Please don't get so close to me Hello, mom Xiangzhi, how's everything going? Why haven't you been heard much since you moved into your aunt's home? Have you caused her any trouble? There's nothing wrong Fine, then. What matters most now is your study You must make up for what you have left behind Do you understand? Mom, I What's the matter? I just wonder if I can change school again? What's wrong? Have you got into any trouble over there? No Not really Remember to take the pills Stop imagining things Goodbye then Jiang Wu Youshu Is everything all right? You know pretty well what kind of person I am That's true. You never admit defeat Do you think I need to explain that to her? The letter I gave her that day was just so sudden Lin Xiangzhi What's up? The letter I gave you last week might make you feel awkward I apologize for that Who are you? I I am Xu Youshu I don't know you at all What a kill shot lesson learned For what purpose did she say that? Is it reluctant acceptance? I don't think this is the right term to describe it This is obviously just a polite refusal You guys What are you doing here, looking so shady? Your desk mate is so unpredictable A weekend has passed and now she says she doesn't know Xu Youshu at all What? So much for this class We will have a test tomorrow Xu Youshu Yes Ma'am I'm watching you You must carefully review the lessons Let's call it a day Hold on Just go What are you doing? I'm going with you It's none of your business I just want to figure out what's the matter with Lin Xiangzhi Your mom has briefly told me about your past College Entrance Exam is the one and only goal in the senior repeating class Just tell me if you have any trouble I'll definitely help you out I just find it so weird Last Friday she tore up your letter While this morning she pretended that she didn't know you Well, perhaps Lin Xiangzhi is just someone who always keeps to herself You're over reacting Silence A woman's intuition is always reliable There must be something wrong The two of you will only click when you're gossiping Song Xiaonan Hey, she's over there Silence What should we do? We've been spotted There's nothing to worry about You're just here to ask some questions Hey, Lin Xiangzhi Come on Jiang Wu wait for me Jiang Wu Stop there Lin Xiangzhi Wait a second Hey Lin Xiangzhi, Please wait a second This morning why did you pretend that you didn't know Xu Youshu? Xu Youshu? Who is he? No way We've been in the same class for a week Last week you even tore up a letter from me What about me? Do you remember who I am? You're my desk mate All of you are my classmates But I really don't know what you were talking about That's impossible Could it be that I got you hit in the head? What are you doing? She's all right Cut it out, Lin Xiangzhi I'm not pretending Then how could you forget that? You wouldn't believe even if I tell you about it I believe you I do believe in you I have this syndrome a syndrome that makes me forget my friends Because of it my memory of my friends only lasts for 7 days What does that mean? Are you saying that you have amnesia? To be exact it's called a post-traumatic stress disorder I once got hurt by accident I stayed in hospital for a while After I got well I thought everything would be okay But later I found that I wouldn't remember all my friends every Monday Neither could I recall the names and looks of my classmates even for a newly met friend I would also forget him or her on Mondays The doctor said that something went wrong with my short-term memory I couldn't even remember what happened on the day of accident After the treatment the exact reason still couldn't be found The doctor could only decide that I suffered from PTSD So there's no way I could become friends with you For as long as I get a memory of pleasure anyone I want to be friends with except my family will be erased from my memory each and every time Monday comes All the memory about friends will be gone altogether Friends Even so that won't be a problem Do you really buy her story? She's got no reason to lie about this That's right Then how can you prove that you're not lying? If you want me to prove it this is the only thing I can show you I'll never ask you to believe me Because I can never make friends in the first place Making friends with me will do you no good You'll be forgotten So could you please stop approaching me in days to come Lin Xiangzhi let us share your sufferings Even if your memory will only last for 7 days that makes no difference We can become one-week friends Until you can truly remember us Wait a minute what do you mean by us? Thank you for your kindness But I transferred to this school to prepare for the College Entrance Exam I don't want any friends Have you found that? She actually wants to become friends with me What She just said that she had forgotten everything about us in a week But she would only forget friends Friends Don't you see that?

Why do you have to be friends with me? I'll tell you if you come in Come on My solution is to keep a diary As long as you write down what you've done with friends in the diary even if you forget your friend on Monday you will remember everything that has happened once you've seen the diary But I, I just You actually want to have friends, right? I'll be your friend Just give it a shot Let's find a solution to get over your illness Choose one Xu Youshu If you really want to be my friend Can you promise me something? I promise How can you make a promise before I tell you what it is? I'll promise you anyway I want you to study hard Do not give up on the exam Okay You can help me with my study Is that all right? Don't bargain over it What color do you like? -This one - This one It's decided then Let's go Here we are Where are we? It's a deserted astronomy classroom of our school It's been out of service for a long time And I as the most excellent student in charge of sanitation of this school was once designated to clean this place Are you sure there is such a title? You can come here at noon breaks Nobody's gonna bother you here Welcome to my secret base What a huge telescope It even spins It has become our secret base I can finally become a one-week friend Just as I have promised I keep working hard But to my surprise The required answer of this problem is Youshu Hi, Lin Xiangzhi Song Xiaonan has joined us Hi Why did you bring everyone here? What's the problem, Xu Youshu? Is this supposed to be your property? You promised not to quarrel I just couldn't help it All right I'll count you in Just for your sake I never knew that there would be such a great place in our school How about coming here for shelter on Dec. 21 this year Shelter? Are you so scared of death? That's the end of the world Of course I'm scared I've never dated anyone It won't come The end of the world won't come until the exam is over How do you know that? Because getting good grades means the day of rebirth While repeating senior year again is the end of the world Is that right, Lin Xiangzhi? Then the end of Xu Youshu's world is coming soon As if you were not going to meet your end No matter what, I'm still an English class representative Okay? But I've got Xiangzhi's help, right? Hey, what if the end of world won't come just as Jiang Wu predicted? We'll come here anyway But for celebration instead of shelter That's great How's that, Xiangzhi? Okay Let's start to fix up this place Let's go Doomsday surviving squad Yeah Every Monday We get acquainted with Lin Xiangzhi once again Even though she will forget us every week You have forgotten us again But we can always find each other in her diary book Hello I am Xu Youshu In that case, you won't forget me anymore Xiangzhi it's Monday again Do you still remember us? You've forgotten us again Try to recall I've heard that a clear impression will help you get remembered So he tries to get dressed in an impressive way Hey, that's a bit too much So you should solve this problem like that I'll mark coordinate axis Try to draw it yourself Xu Youshu Yep Jiang Wu Song Xiaonan x+y= 5 Song Xiaonan is equal to a pig Xu Youshu I'm gonna kill you Come on This is to celebrate the end of the mock Cheers Hey, help yourself I've got a hunch that I can definitely enter a good college this year Of course Which major would you like to choose I prefer psychology Psychology? But you're so good at math It would be a pity if you don't choose a major about investment analysis and finance I became good at math with the help of a friend that I knew before What about you, Jiang Wu? What major will you choose? I just want to study in Beijing The major doesn't matter But why? Because Jiang Wu's parents and sister work in Beijing I'm a left-behind child I just want to enter a college in Beijing so that I can stay with them How come you've never told me about that? Because he doesn't want to Come on, Xu Youshu Have some pig brains to make you smart It's good for your own brain I appreciate that What about you, Xiaonan? I don't care about the major either Beijing is a nice choice Wherever Jiang Wu goes, I'll follow Wherever Jiang Wu goes, I'll follow Okay Let's change the topic That's outrageous How come nobody has asked me about my major? Can you ever enter a college? What are you talking about? With Xiangzhi's help I can definitely rock the boat Rock the boat? That saying doesn't work like that Xiangzhi Anyway his Chinese sucks He sucks in all the other subjects Shut up Come on, help yourself Thank you So, is that supposed to be love at first sight? I have this syndrome that makes me forget my friends How dare you throw a ball at me? Xu Youshu, it's you again! How come Why did no one wake me up?

Happy birthday Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Look here Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday You have arranged everything here? Thank you Thank you so much You're welcome However it's not my birthday today It's just 3 days away You will easily find out if we do this prank on your birthday Well, just make a wish first Okay Then I wish everybody could get good grades in the exam Well, that's a pragmatic wish My second wish is that Xiangzhi could have a normal memory You told me that getting acquainted with me every week Would keep you refreshed, didn't you? That's what dudes do What did you say? How dare you hit me? Move on My third wish is Who's up there What are you doing? Gosh Run We've been spotted What are you doing? I've enjoyed the cake with my eyes I dropped my camera Just leave it and run Hey, the window over there Who's in the house? Go Let's hurry Take care, Xiaonan Hey, which class are you in?

You haven't made the third wish You'll get unlucky if you haven't finished making that wish All right Make a wish now Xu Youshu My third wish is just for you Even though your memory only lasts a week I'll spend a lifetime loving you I will keep you company until until your illness is treated In that case you'll never forget me anymore Lin Xiangzhi I love you What's wrong, Xiangzhi? I'm sorry Xiangzhi Are you all right, Xiangzhi? I have beaten up that fool for you It's okay now Hey, Youshu Xiangzhi Xu Youshu Lin Xiangzhi have you read the diary? What diary? The diary book It has a cover with round dots There's a picture of me in it Youshu Xiaonan Jiang Wu Jiang Wu Come here Oh, this one What's up? You must remember this, right? She doesn't remember her diary Hello, I am Xu Youshu I don't know what you're talking about Do I know you guys well? Where's your diary book? All the people and things that matter to you have been written in it Wait a minute What's going on? No, I don't have it That's not right - Hey, Youshu - What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Why are you searching my schoolbag? Xiangzhi Try your best to recall Did you leave your diary at home? I don't have a diary What do you want from me? Xiangzhi No, I don't have it Please come with me What are you doing? Just come with me Youshu Let me go What are you doing?

I don't know what you want from me But I have to go back for class now Wait a minute Where are you going? Where is it? Astronomy classroom Hallway Swimming pool Silence, everyone It's time for class Jiang Wu Where is Xu Youshu? On the way home He's not feeling well today, sir Why is he always feeling unwell before class? Hello Have you seen a diary book? No I'm looking for a diary book Have you seen one? No, I haven't Jiang Wu Look Xiangzhi Xiangzhi Do you remember me now? I've found your phone number But I haven't found the diary yet I'll look for it somewhere else Stop doing that That diary is really important It's equal to your memory I don't need that memory That's because you don't remember that We once went to the astronomy classroom together And you helped me with my study Even if you're telling the truth Will that make any difference? I don't want to be bothered now I can't afford to waste any time I can't afford to fail College Entrance Exam again If we just hang out together every day and idle our time away What are we going to do in the future? Have you thought about that? Is it because of your illness? You're afraid that you will forget your friends every week If that's the case I'm not afraid that you would forget me If you just want to study hard then I won't bother you Because of you I have started to work hard I'll try my best to enter a college in the same city as you do Even if I can't that won't matter I'll find a way to live near your college In that way I can protect you all the time Because you're so important for me But you're not important for me at all You're lying That's it I don't care about you I don't want to be your friend I don't want to do that even if I don't have that illness Do you understand? Don't flatter yourself Xiangzhi Youshu You guys just stop getting close to me Especially you, Xu Youshu Especially you, Xu Youshu Especially you, Xu Youshu Xiangzhi Especially you, Xu Youshu Especially you, Xu Youshu Especially you Youshu Xu Youshu Xu Youshu Youshu What's wrong with you, Xu Youshu? Youshu I think he just broke down because of some kind of stimulation You don't have to worry so much He'll stay in hospital for observation these days All right Okay Thank you Not at all Ma'am what's the matter with Youshu? Nothing serious The doctor just said that he was just too tired He's been working extra hard recently He needs to have a good rest and get enough sleep Thanks god he's all right I was so worried It's getting late You should get back and have some rest Okay Goodbye, Ma'am Goodbye Goodbye, Ma'am Let's go Don't disturb him Ma'am Youshu Does he get along with his classmates in school? He's so nice to everyone And now he's working hard, too So much the better That's the right thing to do You must think the same, right? Actually Youshu is not silly at all He didn't do well in College Entrance Exam last year So I let him transfer to another school in hopes of him living a safe and healthy life So that I can fulfill my goal His dad died young I know you've had a hard time But do you think that Youshu doesn't need to know these true facts? College Entrance Exam is coming soon And you'll go your separate ways soon Do these facts really matter now? A lie is always a lie It cannot bring any good results I'm sorry, Youshu I lied to you I lied to Xiaonan I lied to Jiang Wu Someone like me does not deserve any friend (Four years ago. Heping Senior High School.) During my first year of senior high school in Heping Senior High School I met my best friend Xu Jie Excuse me Hi Are you Xu Jie? Yeah We're in the same class, right? Yeah Lin Xiangzhi Xiangzhi - You're skipping the class - You're skipping the class Mi la ti do do Are you all right? It was so close Who did that? That guy must suck in basketball Is this your ball? Yeah, are you all right? Okay Xu Youshu Where's the ball? Hey, I'm coming Excuse me Here it is Hey, by the way We're having a PE class, too Don't worry I won't tell on you And please don't tell anyone that I broke the glass From that day on Xu Jie and I have become best friends Xu Jie always helped me; a good-time girl with math During the breaks we would buy stuff at the store We would have lunch together in the dining hall We were best friends How's your math test No way You can't have it Xiangzhi Hurry I'm coming I've found something wonderful A star necklace You like the stars? Yeah Why? I once read a saying in a magazine The way to reach stars is extremely difficult But difficult roads always lead to a beautiful destination What about mine? We can wear it in turn Great Amazing The necklace of sisters Exactly the same Come on Pass it here Just pass him the ball To whom? When did you start to like him? The day we met in the storeroom You Jesus What are you gonna do? You're always full of ideas Just do me a favor How can you just let me watch him at a distance? I've done some research He'll definitely go past here on his way home If a girl happens to have a flat tire when he goes past here What is he going to do? He might help me fix the tire Why didn't you say fix your bike? He would definitely give you a ride Do you need help? I had a flat tire So I have to lock it here I'll give you a ride let's go Bye What a coincidence Hi Hi Thanks for helping me yesterday You're welcome By the way have you got your bike fixed? Yes Why do you come for lunch so early today? You've made much progress Lin Xiangzhi Zip it Just enjoy your meal Cheers Since that day Xu Youshu came into our lives However I didn't expect that our lives would have come to this point. Have you finished swapping your seats? Yes Let's move on with our lessons She doesn't have to do that even if she wants to study hard Hey, Xu Youshu I'm stuffed I've gotta go now Hey, Youshu On the day we looked for the diary I actually found Lin Xiangzhi was not quite herself Do you remember that when we were in hospital that day She stayed there after we left I tried to turn around and have a look But you stopped me Truth always hides beneath the surface Why did you text me to come here? Xiangzhi, you really don't remember us? Why do you suddenly act like a totally different person? What do you want from me? Xiangzhi, answer me this Which high school did you go to before you transferred here? Heping Senior High School Do you know that Youshu was also a student there before he came here? You've known him for a long time And you aren't sick You've been lying to us the whole time, right? I asked my friend in Heping Senior High School He knows about you two And he told me to stay away from you I don't know what he meant by that Because I told you that I was sick and I would forget my friends You aren't sick I checked You don't have the so-called amnesia We were fools for believing you so much, especially Youshu And what about Xu Jie? Why did you lie to us? Lin Xiangzhi, explain it. Lin Xiangzhi, explain now Why don't you explain yourself? Sorry Sorry, I... I did lie to you Actually, I wanted to tell you the truth the day Youshu found the journal I wanted to tell you everything I'm sorry, please don't look at me like that But... But the moment I saw Youshu on that day, when I looked him in the eyes I lost the nerve to tell the truth I'm sorry Because the one who really suffers from memory loss isn't me It's Youshu It all started on the day in our winter vacation of senior high The three of us went for a picnic by a lake in the suburbs Lin Xiangzhi Xu Youshu You, big fool Hey Hey What's really going on in your mind? Tell me now I put the letter in the picnic basket That's why we're here on the boat now Now you get it I thought you were going to give it to him in person Xiangzhi, look at him, is he checking the picnic basket? Is he? Seems like it He seems to be looking at something Do you see? Is he holding something? Is it my picnic basket? Oh, be careful I can't tell Me neither Xu Jie Xu Jie Give me your hand Xu Jie, grab my hand Xiangzhi Come on Grab my hand I can not swim Xu Jie Xu Jie Xu Youshu Help Xiangzhi Help Xu Youshu Help Xiangzhi Xu Jie Xiangzhi Xu Jie Grab it Xu Jie Xu Jie is still in the water Xu Jie Xu Jie is still in the water She's still down there Wait here for me Help Help Can anyone hear me? Help! Youshu Xu Jie Help Youshu Xu Jie Help Help Help Help! Can anyone hear me? Help! Anyone? Help! Stop crying Give my sister back You know she can't swim Why did you take her boating? Why aren't you dead? It should be you Why? Get out Get out I don't want to see you Get out Are you? Are you going to express your love? Yeah I'm working on it Doctor Why is my son still in a coma? Is he gonna be alright? Yaoyao Yeah? We shouldn't talk to her anymore She's bad luck So far, he's been in a coma But the injury on his head isn't serious That's the silver lining I see Thank you Who did this? No idea Maybe Xu Jie It's not okay to bully your classmates We taught you better than this I don't want to see this happen again Yes, ma'am And I know what you did to Xiangzhi You guys, come to my office after class Xiangzhi Xu Youshu is awake Youshu Youshu How are you feeling? I brought you some fruits and orange juice What's wrong? Are you okay? Should I get the doctor? Who are you? I'm Lin Xiangzhi And who's that? Cognitive confusion? It's also called PTSD He may not be able to accept what happened It was too much for him So, he developed a sense of self-protection And that is the cause of cognitive confusion He erased everything and everyone related to the accident from his memory Besides, he was deprived of oxygen for a long time in the water It's possible that he suffers from a temporary memory loss I'm his mother I need to protect my son I'm begging you Please don't come to see him again Please don't let him see you again I know it's not fair to you But you also hope that Youshu could have a happy life Don't you? I see No I am not Lin Xiangzhi You're so lucky I am not I am not I am not I am not I am not I am not I am not I am not Mom I miss Xu Jie so much Xiangzhi From now on you can try to keep a journal It can help you relax It's like talking to a hole in a tree You can write anything in your journal The good and the bad Your stress will ease In that case, your condition will be improved I've explained the answers to these questions many times in class With your current grades, how could you get into college? Xiangzhi, studying is your top priority You need to perform as you used to and get into a nice school So that you won't fail your parents and your friends Understand? I don't blame you for failing in the exam I don't think your current school suits you I've asked your aunt She said she had an empty room at her place I'm wondering if I should transfer you You may be able to concentrate on preparing for the next College Entrance Exam over there Xiangzhi, you can use this room It used to be a storeroom But I cleaned it up It should it okay now I'll leave you to unpack Come down for dinner later The first day I was in Shenghua Senior High School, the moment I walked into the class, I saw my most familiar and strangest friend Is this a joke? I had to pretend not to know him Hello, everyone I'm Lin Xiangzhi He didn't seem to recognize me Looks like he still suffers from memory loss Can I transfer again? Now what should I do to get through the rest of the days? Lin Xiangzhi, please read this letter I want to be your friend I truly hated myself at that moment Xu Jie should be the one receiving that letter I don't deserve to be Youshu's friend I don't even deserve to have friends It was like my fate was taunting me In the heat of that moment, I had to pretend not to know Xu Youshu I had to pretend to have amnesia to escape from reality Who are you? However, once you told a lie, you need to cover it with more lies So, I thought of that fishes only have seven seconds of memories I have a condition that I forget about my friends I can only remember my friends for seven days because of my condition As long as my memory only lasts for a week, we can't be friends That was the best for both of us But Youshu refused to give up He did everything he could trying to help me with this fake disease I couldn't cross the line Why did I survive instead of Xu Jie, the one he was supposed to love? I decided to hide my journal Cross out everything It may be the best Back to the beginning when we were strangers As if we never met I don't care about you I don't want to be your friend I wouldn't be your friend even if I weren't sick Don't flatter yourself If you really understand, I'm begging you again I'll take this as a coincidence I know it's hard for you too But it'll only make Youshu more miserable, if he remembers I just want this nightmare to end as soon as possible Okay? I know you won't forgive me I won't forgive myself either But I'm begging you Please don't let Youshu go through that again Just give me some time I'll make myself disappear right after the exam I promise Xiangzhi, I don't know Xu Jie But you need to know that none of this is your fault Youshu, let's go Where are you going? It's that way Don't we have plans today? She doesn't recognize us Don't do this to yourself Let's go Let's go Song Xiaonan Do you believe in the end of the world? Shh, stop talking 10 seconds until Dec 22nd Five Four Three Two One It's midnight We aren't dead See I told you nothing's gonna happen Do you think Xiangzhi remembers our plan for today? Mind your own business The exam is less than six months away I agree with Lin Xiangzhi We should all mind our own business Here's for us surviving the end of the world Yay! Cheers (Countdown to the College Entrance Examination.) My son Oh, my son You did great, my son It's finally over Xiaonan Look This is for you Wu Hey, sister How's your exam? Fine How do you want to celebrate tonight? Anything will do Let's go Let me buy you a gift How's your exam? It's not so hard this year I did alright But I still can't get my mind around it Xiaonan, have you decided which city you want to go to? You want me to go to Beijing, right? I saw Dai expressing his love to you that afternoon Y- You saw that? Actually I don't care what you said to him I just want to tell you that, Xiaonan, I love you We haven't seen each other for days And I've been thinking about you I felt so sad seeing another man confessing to you I guess this is how you feel when you love someone So, I want to ask you Will you be my girlfriend? How could you say you love me in a skewer restaurant? It's so not romantic Why didn't you say something earlier? I've decided to go to Australia That's fine It's good It'll be good for you to see the world You just said you loved me And now you're saying goodbye? No, no I'll be waiting for you Really? We can call, text and video chat with each other every day I also can visit you during holidays Because I know that my love for you will never change even we're apart Okay How's your exam? Fine If I can't get into a second-tier one I should at least get into a third-tier college Not bad How about you? Me? I should be able to get into a college in Beijing What's wrong? It should be okay if I go see Xiangzhi now, right? Youshu Can you really explain love? I've made up my mind I'll go see her tomorrow I want to ask her which school she's going to apply Then I'll apply to a school in the same city But she doesn't recognize me now So, I want you to go with me It's more convincing Youshu I can go with you But have you thought about it? When you go to college, you'll be in another city and meet more people There'll be more opportunities Besides, she says she forgets about you every seven days Do you truly want that for your life? But there's only one Lin Xiangzhi If you value me as your friend Don't see her again Hey Hey What do you mean? Going to see her is a waste of your time I dare you to say that again You despise her because of her illness I don't I'm telling you everything she said was a lie Shut up Hitting me won't make a difference There's no cure for her disease That's my business I want to heal her Don't you get it? There's no cure Youshu Xu Jie Youshu Youshu Xu Jie Youshu Xu Jie Youshu Who's Xu Jie? You remembered Give me your phone Give it to me Youshu, calm down Youshu I have something important to tell her Lin Xiangzhi said she would leave for your sake after the exam and she didn't want you to get hurt again Hello Is this Lin Xiangzhi's residence? She left to the station I'm happy I got to see Youshu again and to know Xiaonan and Jiang Wu I thought I would face it alone I didn't expect you to accept me I didn't explain myself in senior one But misunderstanding increased as rumors spread I don't want Youshu to relive the pain of losing a friend So, I left after the exam I snapped my phone card and cut myself off from everyone It's enough to have met you Xu Jie You once told me it's hard to get to the stars Are you there yet? Wait Slow down Slow down, wait for me Come on Let's take a photo Three Two One Come on Look So beautiful Delete it Delete it now No way I won't Coming Mrs Xu Jiang Wu Youshu It's me Open the door I'm here to return your PSP I'll take it with me if you don't open the door Youshu Why do you avoid me? I know you blame me for hiding the truth from you But do you know the real truth? The real truth is that we care about you We didn't want to disturb you for the sake of the exam The planetarium will be torn down in a while Xiaonan and I cleaned things up I brought you this And I want to say goodbye Call me when you're free (People who we treasured the most) (no matter where they are) (memories will last forever) Xu Xu Youshu You are? Xu Jie's brother Sorry, ma'am It took me so long to visit you I found this when I cleaned my sister's room It's filled with all of your photos There's a letter in it that Jie wrote to you I read it I believe it was an accident These memories belong to you Take it with you Thank you, ma'am I'll cherish it Wait Stay for lunch, will you? No one wants to see that accident I think no one in my family is willing to accept the devastating fact that Jie is gone But if your life gets stuck because of it, it will only make you and us live in pain Lin Xiangzhi has come many times But she never got the courage to come in You two must take care of yourselves Coming Hello A package for Lin Xiangzhi Xiangzhi Lately, I haven't been able to reach you So, I didn't dare to go see you I was afraid you wouldn't see me This was Jiang Wu's bad idea He told me to write you a journal He asked me to write about every day since I met you It also could make up for the days that I lost my memory Don't mind my poor handwriting ♪ Thank you for being tough enough ♪ ♪ to heal our loneliness ♪ I know I wasn't brave enough to tell you how I feel about you which caused misunderstanding among us I always notice you in the crowd But I always miss my chances of expressing my feeling to you Where's the girl who's always with you?
