In 1941 (Showa 16) Japanese properties in the US were frozen, Export of petroleum to Japan was banned. Due to the ABCD (American-British-Chinese-Dutch) encirclement and its economic pressure, Japan was facing the crisis of life or death and declared the war against the US and Britain for the self-defence and the fate of the nation. 12 AM in March 1, 1942 (Showa 17) Java, Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) Charge! MERDEKA 17805 Hey! I have been waiting for you. She says so. In Java, there is a legend saying that yellow people come from east to liberate people in Java from white people and release them from agony for ages. Lieutenant, she is saying that you are that person. Translater Yamana, tell them. Yes, sir! You and we are same Asians. The objective of this war is to liberate Asian people under the western rule for 4 centuries. You and Japanese people are brothers. I promise to expel Dutch people from Dutch East Indies and give freedom to you. The landing operation was a great success. The damage to our force is small. The enemies are retreating to the fortless of Bandung where the headquarter of Dutch army. However, suddenly yesterday they fought back with tens of tanks. In responce to this, the combined unit lead by Colonel Shoji fought back, with the air support, pushing the enemies back and forcing them a great damage. Shoji detachment is running after this enemy unit and approaching the fortless of Bandung. According to the report, now they are preparing to attack the fortless. Then, it's going to be the decisive battle. However, Bandung is the heart of controlling Java and their defence is solid. Besides the defence, their strength is 50,000 including Dutch, US, and Australian forces. As opposed to this, our strength is 25,000. In the case of decisive battle, we will also suffer tremendous damage. Now, what about infiltrating into the fortless of Bandung to recommend a surrender to the enemy commander? Huh? Due to the retreatment after retreatment, the moral of enemy forces is quite low now. If we take the advantage of this situation, it might work. You can do it. Let's try this, sir. Is that so. If you succeed, we can save the life of many soldiers. Takeo Shimazaki will infiltrate into the fortless of Bandung and will complete the mission at the cost of his life, sir. I cannot guarantee that we can come back alive. I'm totally aware of it because we are entering hostile territory. Aren't you afraid? Of course, I am afraid. But it's a great honor for me because I'm with the Messiah of Java. Besides, Bandung is like my backyard so I'm sure I can hep you. It's been 25 years since I came from Japan to here. For me, Java is my second hometown. People in Indonesia welcomed me with kindness. I was running a corner store, I met many other Japanese people with different jobs, and we were living happily with local people. But Dutch people are terrible. The living standard between them and local people is completely different. Local people are not allowed to talk to them, being treated like animals. What's that? Stop! Stop! Be carefull! There're Japanese soldiers. What are you doing here this late? There's a supply to the British military headquarter. Did you see any Japanese soldiers on the way? No, no we didn't. OK. Dutch headquarter in Bandung. Stop! I'm Lieutenant Takeo Shimazaki from the Imperial Japanese Army. I need to see the commander, let me pass! I'm Lt. Shimazaki, the messanger from Japanese Army. I need to see the commander, Lt. General, ter Poorten. Who is in charge, here? I swear to this sword. I came here to recommend a surrender. Right now, our 100,000 soldiers are preparing for the total attack and waiting for my report. If I don't come back, they will complete the preparation with aviation units awaiting and they will start the total attack at 0600. The moral is very high. They will wipe out the Bandung fortless. Now, shoot me if you can! General is now sleeping. Wake him up! Can you wait until he is dressed? He doesn't have to. Call him now! The commander of East Indies Army, Lt. General, ter Poorten. I recommend the commander to surrender immediately. Only one hour left until the anihilation of Bandung. Answer right now! In March 9, 1942 (Showa 17) The surrender of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army We announce to people in Indonesia, we, Japanese Army, are here to liberate people in Asia from the rule of white people. we started military operations in Malay and Burma, and gained victory. You people, please understand the objective of this holy war and support the Japanese army. It doesn't matter. Simply the ruler changes from Dutch to Japanese. Unite Asia! Japan and Indonesia share the common objective. Unite Asia. Present arms! Can you give this to others? Thank you, general. Regarding the military rule, I will inform you the intention of the central headquarter. Please, consider this. I'm listening. The policy of your 16th Army is against the intention of the central headquarter. You should take a hardline policy. I strongly believe that my ruling policy is loyal to that of the center and is well-adjusted to the reality of the local situation. Has the ruling policy presented at the beginning of the war been changed? Since the situation has changed from the beginning, I don't think we have to stick to it, anymore. We don't have to stick to the policy, anymore? How has the situation changed? We defeated the enemy a lot faster than we expected. Therefore, we should conquer local people to make them obey our order, which will make our military campaign easier and enable us to obtain the required resources. We cannot decide just by looking at only 2 month and half of rule. Unless we observe for half year or one year, we cannot tell whether hardline or softline policy is better. In Singapore and Malay, I observed the strong presence of Japanse Army but here in Java it seems to me it is very lenient. It's just a matter of different perspective. As far as Java concerned, I believe that the hardline policy of the center is inappropriate. I believe that the deployed forces should obey the policy of the center. Therefore, once we receive the order, we must obey it. If we cannot harmonize these two beliefs, you can dismiss me by reporting to the Minister of Army. Although you came to persuade me all the way from the center, my ruling policy in Java will not change unless I receive the official new policy. How is that? Do you give up? Not yet. You are such a stubborn guy as usual. Not as much as you, sir. From the Staff Headquarter, we know each other for long time. Yes, sir. Sir, half year. I can struggle for half year in the center. During this time, please show your achievement in Java. If you are being stubborn too much, you will be dismissed. Be carefull with yourself, sir. The 16th Army Headquarter The request you submitted regarding the training of local young people was accepted by the Army Headquarter. There was an opinion saying that Indonesian people are tamed by the Dutch rule for long time and are not willing to fight. However, as part of intelligence activities conducted by our 'Beppan(another team)' in the Staff Headquarter it is now permitted. Thank you very much for your support, sir! As the secret code, why don't you call it 'the Youth Training Camp?' Very well, sir! Now your dream comes true, Shimazaki. Yes, sir! I will teach them everything I learned in Nakano School (Spy School). You are chosen from many Indonesian young people In January 8, 1943 (Showa 18) The opening celemony of the Youth Training Camp and become the members. We, Japanese Army, are fighting to get Asia back in the hand of Asian people. You have been under the Dutch rule for 350 years and falling behind for every aspect. I'm hoping that you learn everything from us as soon as possible to become strong people, catch up, and liberate Indonesia by your own hands. Our Asia, your country, let's liberate Indonesia! Now, I introduce your instructors to you Lieutenant Miyata. He teaches you Japanese, the history of Indonesia, and related international affairs. He support this training camp together with me, Shimazaki. Next, Sergeant Tsukamoto. He is a veteran and will teach combat skills which you need to fight such as shooting, bayonet. What's up? It's you. Come on! Private First Class Kuriyama. He is in charge for the physical training. Fight as if he was the enemy! Fight until die! Sanpai mati! (Until die!) Similary, Private First Class Toyokawa. He will support the training and teach you how to handle weapons. Carefull with this part. Translater Kawamura. He was born in Java like you and his mother is also Indonesian. March forward! According to 'the British-Dutch pact,' Britain rules areas north from Malay. The Netherlands rules the Lesser and Superior Sunda Islands in the south and rules all Indonesia. They called 'Dutch East Indies.' Anyone can explain the Dutch rule of Indonesia? There's no one? Holland established the 'East India Company.' They conquered divided muslim kingdoms by arms, ruled Java Island, they monopolized all the resources, and deprived from Indonesia. Asep. You're from the royal family and studied in the Duch school. Were you permitted to enter the Dutch school? You're brave to enter this 'Youth Traning Camp.' It's because I was quite happy with Japan's victory over Russia We want to fight by learning from you. Are you doing Wayan Kuri? Yes, I am. Please come to see my father's Wayan. Salute! Hey! Why don't you salute? Salute? Like this. Did you forget how to greet to your superior? What is he saying? Now it's a break time. What? Lt. Shimazaki. We found him. Nurhadi! I heard the story. The instructor beat you and hurt your pride. That's my fault not to instruct my subordinate well. I'm not going to let this happen again. So come back to the training camp. He says: I don't want to go back to the camp where there is a bastard like him. You're the member of the Youth Training Camp part of 'Beppan' in the Staff Headquarter of the 16th Army. You cannot behave like this. I don't need an instruction from Japanese! Leave me! I don't want to go back to the training camp! You cannot behave like this! You think you can beat Dutch like this? Stand up! Fight me! Stand up! The independence is not what Japanese Army gives. That's what you, Indonesian, gain by yourselves. The camp is to gain the power for that. Did you forget that? Japan was also about to be colonized by the west but prevented it by people's power. Stand up! If you give up the independence, do whatever you want! We don't need a guy like you in our camp. Lieutenant, please stop standing with me. He says. No way. The runaway is my responsibility. Lieutenant has nothing to do with this. The responsibility of soldier is the responsibility of the commander. It's a group responsibility. Stand still! You're dismissed when the sun sets. Sanpai Mati! (Until die!) The spirit of fight until die! Captain. I also want to enter the training camp. You will need a nurse too. A woman cannot enter this camp. Even though you cannot enter the camp, you can support the independence. With this in mind, you do your best in your own part. Since you are a nurse, you can help a lot. It reminds me of the sky in Iwate Prefecture back home. Red leaves, Mt. Iwate covered with snow. If there was no war, what would we be doing right now? In any case, I think I would be a soldier, too. I would most probably be a teacher. An art teacher? I don't know about that but... Beside trees, lying on the grass of the castle, my heart of 15 years old staying in the sky. The poetry of Takuboku Ishikawa? When I was in Junior High, my dreams and hopes grow bigger by looking at the sky, and are rising into the sky. Into the blue sky. I used to feel like this and look up the sky. My dream was the liberation of Asia. The sky in Iwate Prefecture and that in Java are no difference. Under the same sky, people hate each other and are fighting. Although nationality and race are different, we are the same human-being. I named your baby 'Fumiko' as you suggested and prayed in the Hachiman-sama shrine. I keep your room as it was when you left for the war and we are waiting for your safe return. I wish your father come back soon. Raising the national flag of Indonesia was initiated by Japanese Army to develop the spirits of independence for Indonesian people. Now you're telling us to stop it? This is the order from the Imperial General Headquarters. I don't agree. The order also tell us that we should refrain from the activity to arouse the independence movement. Are you going to break the promise? Is this the right thing to do? No. Now we are teaming up with local people and moving toward the independence. Nobody can stop this movement. However, we must obey the order of the Imperial General Headquarters. As long as the spirits of independence is not lost, it should be fine. The objective of the military rule in occupied areas is to win the Great Asia War, not to provoke the independence movement. I'll do my best. I believe in the independence (Merdeka) and I'll do my best. I'll do my best. I'll do my best. Sanpai Mai! (Until die!) Open the door! Captain! Captain, please! Come on, girl! Captain! Please, stop! What? Are you from the Youth Training Camp? Yes, sir. I see. Useless bastard with a girl. Stand up! I can educate you. His father is ill and with a permission they are on the way to see his father. Let me borrow this girl. She's his sister. She came to tell him the news about their father. This bastard! Hey, you! I'm Captain Hamamura. If you have any problem, fight me anytime. My brother, Parto! Captain, are you all right? Let's go, sir! Who the hell are you? Appologize to Parto. Come on. You guys are too lienient to the local people. There is also some problem with the leader of the Youth Training Camp! We will consider our faults as well. However, the local people are very different in terms of the customs and religion, for instance, so in order to suppress this, It's impossible to suppress. In the front line, the Youth Training Camp is useless and not necessary. These guys are hindering Japanese Army. You are claiming the independence of Indonesia, but Java is just a base for supply. Provoking the independence movement is againt the national policy. Sir, that's not what you promised. Our mission is to complete the national policy. We should dismiss the Youth Training Camp. Dismissal? Dismissal of the camp is out of question! Watch your word. People in Java have been waiting for our help. We cannot betray them! What are you talking about? Are you disobeying your superior? I'm not going to let you dismiss. Outrageous! Previous year in June 1942, Japanese Forces lost in the campaign of Midway and keep on losing for the US forces, such as the death of naval commander, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the anihilation of Attu Island. The leader of Indonesian nationalism, Sukarno enthusiastically told people, 'Without indipendence, without freedom.' I've been working hard. I talked to everyone in the hospital to cooperate and stand up. But I don't know what to do. Nothing has changed. Although our enemy is just around the corner, what can I do? What am I saying? You don't understand me. I think I can understand what you're saying. You understand me. But how? Your eyes. Your eyes tell me everything. Now the war is in grave situation. We cannot achieve the independence by just looking at it. Young people! Take weapons and fight with Japanese Army! Yes, we will fight! Anyone can enlist in PETA (Java Local Defence Forces). You don't need education nor money. Let's gain the independence by ourselves and defend our own country! We'll fight! In October 10, 1943 (Showa 18), The foundation of Java Local Defence Forces (PETA) Present arms! Release! PETA (Java Local Defence Forces), Each platoon, march forward! Move forward! Glory to the new Indonesia Praise our Local Defence Forces. Japan lost. We should avoid the caotic situation. Yes, sir. I don't know what will happen to us but in the Staff Headquarter I will be in contact and negotiate with the home country. I leave you the command of 'Beppan' in the Staff Headquarter. However, I have soldiers of PETA (Java Local Defence Forces). That's the problem of the Army Headquarter. You will receive an order soon. ...But, sir. Japan lost and in a sense the opportunity of independence came for Indonesian. It's not easy but this is the important moment for them. Shimazaki, I heard that they need your help. However, you have fellow Japanese soldiers. Don't forget that. Do you understand that? Shimazaki. You're Japanese. Do not leave your fellow soldiers behind. Please. Takeo. Probably, you lost weight... Declaration: We, the people of Indonesia, hereby declare the independence of Indonesia The transition of power and other procedures should be conducted swiftly and acculately. Jakarta, in Imperial Calender of Japan August 17, 2605 (17-8-05) Under the name of Indonesian people Skarno and Hatta. Now Indonesia got independent. The Netherlands are coming again but we will fight as Indonesian as you taught us. We will fight to defend Merdeka (independence). However, we are not very experienced yet and we need a leader. Japan surrendered for the Allied Forces and PETA (Java Local Defence Forces) will be dismissed. We will fight as the Indonesian Army. Captain, we want you to fight with us. Why are you silent? The Allied Forces are coming soon. The war is about to begin. I know. Then, why don't you join us? You made the army of this country and educated. When Dutch come, you will be executed as the war criminal. Are you OK with this? I'm still the soldier of Japanese Army. I have my men. I cannot do any selfish conduct. OK, I see. I'm dissapointed. I have a favor, sir. What's that? We need weapons. If you give them to the Allied Forces, please give them to us. I cannot do that. Are you telling us to fight against Dutch without weapons? That's impossible. We cannot win. Are you just abandoning us, sir? Give us the key of the arsenal! Refused. Then, we will just break the door of the arsenal. Follow me! Nurhadi, Wait! What's the problem? I understand your feeling but we are not rioter. Did you forget what we learned in the training camp and Local Defence Forces? Shut up! This is the most important moment for Merdeka (independence). If we are just rioter, we cannot achieve Merdeka. 'Gain Merdek by yourself.' Did you forget the word of the captain? We've been bearing the harsh training. I will fight with faith and belief. Take the pride of Indonesian, Nurhadi. Dismissed. They all left. We always told them to fight until die. Sir! Is this the right thing to do? In September 1945 (Showa 20) The total invasion of British and Dutch forces started. Why don't you open a barber, here? That might be a good idea. I wish we could make rice. How is Japan now? Are factories still left? Well, even though nothing is left, we can build them again. Can we go back to Japan? I envy you. I'm not pure Japanese neither nor Indonesian. I haven't seen Japan, yet. Japanese soldiers are fighting against Indonesian independence army? That's the order from the Allied Forces to maintain the security of the city. Today, Endo unit left for that mission. Those who we trained are fighting against Japanese soldiers. Sooner or later, we will receive the same order. Are you telling us to fight against them? This is going to be the harsh battle. I want to help them in some way. That's not right, Shimazaki. You sholdn't help them. What? Independence should be achieved by themselves. With their own blood and struggle, the independence of Indonesia has a value. We don't abandon them but we just watch them. Shimazaki, as a soldier of the army, you must bring your fellow soldiers back to Japan. I cannot leave these Indonesian people behind and go back to Japan. We came here to receive the weapons. Could you give them to us? We are in trouble. Many people were killed and our camerades in PETA died. Many men died. Give an order to give us the weapons. Do you think I will give up by such an intimidation? You taught us that we need fighting spirits and weapons for Merdeka. We are trained but you don't help us when we really need your help, not even giving us weapons. We are not going to be deceived anymore. Take the weapons and kill anyone who prevent it. Captain, give them an order. Give them an order! Sergeant! What should we do? Let's give them weapons. Ready and aim! Don't shoot! Don't shoot them! Take weapons away. I will take the full responsibility. Forgive me. Nurhadi. Please, try to understand how Shimazaki feels. I will go back to Japan to rebuild the country but my soul is always with you all. Sanpai mati (Until die), but don't die for nothing. Captain! Asep! Enemy attack! Hurry! Get on the car. Quick! Don't move! Captain. Hang on. Go on, Nurhadi! Go ahead! Hurry! Start the car! Hurry! Sampai mati! Captain! My brother, Parto! Where's my brother? To save me... many people died. Captain, that's fine. That's what everyone wanted to do. They were happy to come save you. I will be the soil of Indonesia. When I heard the legend of Java, I made up my mind. We will fight together and gain the independence. Independence or death! You released Shimazaki. We received a letter from your father. It's been while. Fumiko, listen carefully. Dear Sanae and Fumiko, I hope you're doing well. Although Japan lost the war, I am working as a Japanese soldier. Listen carefully. It is about time our return starts. There are some soldiers who decided to stay and fight for the independence of Indonesia, but I will come back to Japan. Look! Your father is coming back! Fine. I will take the responsibility of what other Japanese soldiers did. but... if you say I'm guilty for just being a soldier. Then, what about what you, Dutch people, have been doing in Indonesia for 350 years? Stop. Turn right. Ready. Aim! Fire! Glory to the independence of Indonesia I am truly sorry for my mother and am agonizing. However, I devoted my life to our country. Please consider that my life is already lost. For the indipendence of Indonesia, becoming the soil of a foreign country is the destiny of man. Please forgive me. Now, unfortunately our country lost. Even I became the last soldier, I would fight with Indonesian young peole. If we gain the liberty for the people of Indonesia, I would have no regret for losing my life. Don't retreat! Fight back! Move forward! Fight until die! We will move back. When we lose, we retreat swiftly. This is the order of the commander. Can you run? Almost. Move back! I'm fine. Sorry. When we die, it's all together. Takeo, you wake up now. Where is this? This is the base camp of the independence army. How are you? I'm fine. I feel better. You have been sleeping for the fever of Malaria for long time. It's been for 3 days. I'm glad you're fine. For 3 days... What happened to everyone? They are waiting for your recovery. I will call them. Lieutenant! Salute to Lt. Shimazaki! You guys... Sir, you shouldn't leave your men behind. We've been looking for you. You told us 'Fight until die.' Sir. Captain Kataoka returned to Japan by saying, 'Don't waste your life, Good luck.' Is that so. Did Lieutenant. Miyata come back to Japan, as well? What happend to him? This is the photo my son sent me. I heard that my son was the comrade of your husband in China. It's your Dad. -Dad? His last letter said that he will soon return home. I was looking forward to his return with her. Within 10 days from the last letter, I received a notice saying that he was executed... Is that so. My son will not come back to Japan. He said that he will fight for the independence of Indonesia with people over there. Then, he will not... He will not see me anymore. He will bury his ash in Indonesia. First he fought for Japan and then for Indonesia. Now, I forgot the taste of rice in Japan. Soon you can eat. Lieutenant. Looks like this is your wedding. Japan and Indonesia are united. Long life to Indonesia! Long life to Japan! By looking at these sculptures, people go to heaven by learning the philosophy of Buddha. Though not being a Buddhist, my heart becomes calm and I feel like praying. What do you pray for? Me? I pray for... Merdeka, the independence, and for the peace of Indonesia. Me, too. Another thing... may the happiness with Takeo last forever. Unless we get Indonesian people back, there's no tomorrow. The red in the national flag is the color of our blood. Aryati, look at me. For my honor, I will fight as a Japanese and gain the independence. Raise the flag! In 1949 (Showa 24) Jakarta, The capital Kawamura. Long life to Indonesia. Pita, come back! Abe-san. Under fine weather, wind is blowing in autumn. the melody of singing bell crickets. Recollecting the memory of far hometown. Oh, my father and mother. Now I will leave. Hold! Don't move. He's dead. Ayu, stop it! Our war is to save the life of people. Did you forget the grief of losing your brother? Fire! Charge! Move forward! Move back! Sergeant! Sergeant. Shoot him! Fire! Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm glad to fight together. Hurhadi. Independence or death! Asep! Fight until die! Nurhadi! The day of independence is just around the corner. Thank you, Lieutenant. Well done. This achievement is because of your own power. The independence by Indonesian hands, when you told me so, I thought it would be a dream. For that, many men have died. Japanese soldiers, too. Soldiers of Indonesian independence army, too. Long life to Indonesia. Only I left... The night sky of Java is always beautiful. Especially tonight, it's beautifull. Probably, the souls of those who were killed in the combat became the starts, celebrating Merdeka, the independence. Takeo! Don't die! Indonesia is just starting now. Don't leave us, me! Don't leave us, don't go, Takeo. Takeo! You won. Although Japan lost in the war, you won... you won. Takeo. Kalibata Heroes Cemetary, Jakarta Refused to go back to Japan, there were 2,000 Japanese soldiers who fought the independence war together. Half of them were killed. This is the sword your father gave me. I was given the soul of worrier from Mr. Miyata. You father died in an unfortunate way. His soul stays with me and we fought together. His last word written on the wall of the jail, 'Glory to the independence of Indonesia' morally supported those who fought the independence war. We are pround that you father is sleeping here. Present arms! The souls of those who devoted their live for the independence war, rise to the sky, become stars, and lead us. Becoming stars... Tonight, you can also see your father and Takeo. The star of indipendence. Nameless soldiers who devoted their lives for the indipendence war, The nation never forgets you... Translated/subtitled by opnkikusui, Nikkyoku-kai
