According to a study published in 2015, 15 billion trees are being cut each year. This means that since the beginning of human civilization, only 46 percent of the trees remain worldwide. In the past five decades, we’ve seen and felt the effects of deforestation in different parts of the Philippines. Putting us in the list of countries with serious forest degradation in Southeast Asia. Hon, look at that. - I have a deadline with my Lumad story. - It’s just interesting. I’m sorry. Clear! Whew! Attaboy! Roger, keep your eye on that one. Do your job right. Are our people in the woods doing okay? Is Minda treating our workers right? They’re doing fine, Mayor. Hon, I’m in the mayor’s office right now. I’m sorry hon, but did you see my article on the headline? I’ve read it, see? It’s impressive. Powerful. I’m so proud of you, congratulations. Thank you. How are the kids? Come here! Hi Daddy! Well, I’ll be going to the forest. There’s no signal there, I won’t be able to call you. Daddy, you’ll show me the flower? Of course, I’ll take pictures of the biggest flower in the world. Once I’m done… The moment I get a signal, I promise I’ll send you pictures. Okay? I love you. - Alright, then. - Bye, please take care. - Bye, hon! - Goodbye. Alright, I’ll call you when this is over. Mr. Francis, the mayor can talk to you now. Thank you. - Francis Imperial. - Sir! Congratulations. Very nice to meet you, sir. Same here. I’ve seen your work, you’re a great photojournalist. We have a project, and I’m commissioning you so you can promote our province. - Sure! - You want to see what it’s about? I’m excited about it. This is the Rafflesia. You know, this is one of a kind. And it’s the biggest flower in the world. I’ve also done research on it before I came here. Good, good! So let’s push through with the project. By the way, this is Roger. He’ll accompany you when you go to the mountains. Believe me, he knows every path and trail there. Here’s some money for your needs. Our budget, Mayor. Thank you. - Thank you, Mayor. - Thank you, too. - We’ll go ahead. - Alright. - Are you ready? - Let's go. - Do your best, okay? - Of course. Thank you, Mayor. Can we go to my house first, I just need to drop off something? No problem. Let’s go! Thank you. How do you know Mayor? Well, the Mayor’s office called my publishing company. I flew here immediately. You have giant trees here. You really protect your forests? Yes, no one’s allowed to cut trees here. I’ll be quick, boss. Where’s Mom? You’re angry, I think. - Yes, I have a reason to be angry. - Your son’s here. Dad, Mom. Your father’s wound is not healing. Dad, it looks drier now. - Hey! - Look how cranky he is! You’re so heavy handed. No, because you're in pain. Calm down, Mom. You keep arguing with Dad. Your mom is such a nag. Grandma. - Thank you, grandson. - Have you eaten? This is for you. For expenses. Manage it well. Don’t spend it all at once. You take care of everything. I’ll just go somewhere. Does your son even have something to eat in the house? - Dad, mom. - Where are you off to now? I’ll go on a trip, but I’ll be back soon. Wait, Roger! It's good that you're here. Aunt. - How are you? - Not so good. Take this. - Here's your money. - Thank you so much Roger. Look how happy she is because she has money again. You take care of my grandkids. Yes, aunt. Don’t worry about them. - Thank you. - Return as soon as you can. Yes, Mom. Hey! Roger! Where is my daughter? What? - This guy’s crazy! - What did you do with my daughter? - You son of a bitch! - I don’t know what you’re talking about. - What happened? - My son is innocent. - That’s not my problem! - You know what happened to her! I don’t know what you’re talking about! Bastard! Where's my daughter? Francis, I will show you what they’re doing to me. Enough of that! - You’ll be punished one day! - This isn’t your turf! That’s you and your wife’s problem, don’t drag me into it! Where did you take her? I know nothing about that! - I think he’s gone bonkers! - Fuck you! You try to blame me for your daughter’s actions. You fuck, you took her! What was that about? That’s nothing, don’t worry about it. He's crazy. I don’t even know what he’s accusing me of. The people there, they’re all your family? Yes. The people living in that compound are all my relatives. You’re the eldest? Yes. I have three siblings. Are they still in school? Our parents can't afford to send us to school. I have to find ways for my family to get by every day. My family rely on me to put food on the table. May I ask how long have you been doing this job? - My work? - Yes. I’ve been doing this my whole life. It used to be a hobby. But I started to get paid for what I do. I met my wife through this job. Awesome. Do you have kids, boss? I have two. Both girls. Francis, help us. Save us. Help us, Francis. Francis, save us. Save us. I’m sorry, boss. We’ll have to park here because the truck can’t go further in the woods. We’ll get off here? Let’s go. The women in my dream, messed with my mind. What women? Don’t tell me you have another girl? No. Let’s go. Just follow me. The view is nice there. I’m sure you'd like to take pictures. Roger wait, I’ll just take photos. Are you getting tired? You silly thing, I know you miss me! - Gina. - What? - Hey, come here! - I don’t like you! - Come! - No! - Come here! - Help! - We’ll just play a game! - Let go of me! Be quiet! - Let go of me! - Stop shouting! - No! - It'll be quick. - We will just play! - Please, no! Fuck. - Help! - Gina! - Help me! - Fuck you, come back here! - Come here, you bitch! - Help me! Gina, we will just play here. Come here, you bitch! Gina! Roger, what's that? Maybe just some hunter. Let's move. Roger! - Roger, please help me! - Go away, you crazy bitch! You stink, bitch! What the fuck’s that about? Hey, Roger. See what you did to your girl? She’s wandering everywhere. She's not my girl. You don't know what you're saying. Let’s go, boss. Roger, what was that? That girl, she just went batshit crazy. That guy, he’s a hunter. That girl is always wandering here in the forest. - That guy shouldn't even be hunting here. - I see. Whatever happens, you won’t leave me? I won’t abandon you. You promise to look after me even at work? Besides you'll like working there. We’ll cook Pinakbet. I washed them already. Okay, just put it over there. Make sure you do your job well, okay? - Don't let me down. - Of course, just visit me often. Of course, I'll visit you. - Madam Minda! - Hey, Roger. - That looks delicious. - We are cooking Pinakbet. This is Gina. The one I’ve been telling you about. Hello! - How old are you, dear? - Seventeen, ma’am, turning eighteen soon. You’re still young, and you’re pretty. Come, Roger. Here. Thank you. Gina, I must go now. - Madam Minda, please take care of her. - Alright. Work hard. Roger, don't leave me, I’ll come with you. Don't be stupid. You’re here already. Attend to your job. Go on, Roger. You can leave now. It’ll be dark soon. Take care, okay? - Be safe. - Goodbye. Do you know how to cook? - Yes. - That’s Pinakbet, okay? Just cut the string beans. After that, chop this one. Put it here, when you’re done. Put it here. Whatever happens, you won’t abandon me? I promise, I will never leave you. Just take a bath, you’ll be fine. I was like you once. Boss. Let’s stop here for a while. I’m also tired walking. Maybe we can rest here tonight. - Here? - Yes. Okay. Here are your clothes, leave now! You’re useless! You stink so bad! Take a bath! You stink! How will men want you? Go away now! Go! Take all your stuff! You're disgusting! Take a bath! - You’re useless! - I have nowhere to go. Let go of me! I'm going to kill you! You traitor, you abandoned me! You turned your back on me! Fuck you, why won't you won’t leave us alone? - Roger, don't! - Fuck you! - Idiot! - Asshole! - I'll kill you! - I will stab you! - You won’t you leave us alone? Go away! - I hope you die! - I hope you die! - Sorry about that. She’s raving mad. Lucky you stopped her. Fuck it, man, what’s really happening here? Don’t mind it, boss, she’s just insane. - What? - She’s crazy. Fuck that. Let’s rest now. I’m really sorry. Thank you. You stopped her just in time. - Are you sure she's not coming back? - I'm okay here, don't worry about me. - You can sleep here. - I’m alright, go ahead. Sleep here. Thank you. Are you sure? Francis, save us. Francis, help us. Save us. Help us. Francis, please save us. Francis, please help us. Roger? Roger! Boss? Was this here last night? I don’t know, boss. This wasn’t here last night. We had a bonfire there, right? Any idea where we are? No. - I think this place is enchanted. - Oh, fuck it. - I don’t know. - What’s happening here? - Are you getting us lost on purpose? - No. We both slept in the tent. I know nothing about this. What do we do now? Let’s leave, we are being toyed with. Oh fuck. Boss! He’s the guy yesterday? Maybe a hunter’s stray bullet got him. Let’s go, let’s just keep going. Just like that? Are we still far? Let’s just go home! You want turn back when we've already come this far. Come on, let’s keep going! Hurry up! Look at that. - This is awesome. - Great, isn’t it? - I think I’ve seen this place before. - Where? I thought you haven’t been here before. - You want to go for a swim? - Sure. It’s beautiful! It’s deep here. Is it still far? How many hours until we get there? We should be close to it by now. If we hadn't taken our time, we would have been there already. Are you sure you know the way? Yes, I know the way. Don't worry. Clear! Attaboy! Why are there cows here? Where did they come from? Those are just wild cows. Sometimes they’ll just appear before you. What's that sound? - What? - Don't you hear it? Don't mind them. Let's just go. - I’ll just take photos of it. - What? Come on. I thought your forest was protected, why are there loggers here? They're not illegal, they are just trimming the branches. Let’s go. - I'm still taking pictures. - It's getting late. Who are you? Go away! - Come on. - Hey! - What are you doing? - He’s with me! Why did you bring someone here with a camera? He’s taking pictures. - Let's go. - I’ll delete it. - Want me to blow your brains out? - I’ll delete it now. Let’s go. We’ll get off track. It’s just Roger. Roger, do you really know where we are going? Why? What’s the matter? If you don’t know, just tell me. Let’s not waste time because I'm getting delayed here. We’ve been here two days, and you told me there are no loggers and suddenly one points a gun at me! Why are there loggers? You’re obviously messing with me now, Roger. How? I almost got shot and you expect me to be okay? - I know that guy, he won't shoot. - We've been walking all day. What now! Tell it to me straight! Fuck it! What the hell, Angela’s missing. You saw nothing? You like morenas? You like mestizas? What do you like? Damn it, Roger. We’ve been walking for hours. We’re getting near. I think… we took the wrong trail earlier. Looks like we’re lost. I think we’ve gone off-track. Are you serious? Let’s just keep walking, follow me. Fuck, Roger. Can you still go on? - We’ll get there. Don't worry. - We’re going in circles, fuck it. We're almost there. Stop nagging. How’s it going, Madam? John, I need your help. - You’re stressed again. - Angela disappeared, find her. - That’s alright, she got nowhere to go. - Help me find her. - She can’t go far. - But you better find her now. - Hurry up, let’s find Angela. - She must be nearby. You'll be punished for this. You’ll answer to me if she’s not found! What! Fuck that bitch. - Hurry up. - Damn it. Don’t worry about it. It’s nearly evening. She got nowhere to go. - Help me, Roger! - You dumbass. - Have pity on me! - Does Madam Minda know you’re here? - You promised us a decent job. - I didn't. Roger, what’s happening? - It’s nothing, really… - Sir, help us! - What’s happening? - My sister. - My sister is still there. Please help me. - Where? - Don’t interfere with this. - Roger, what’s happening now? - This is my problem. - Fuck! Do you want to die? What if we both get in trouble? You bitch! Why are you running away? - Stay out of this! - Roger, hey! - What's happening? - This is none of your business! - We’re supposed to find the flower, right? - Go there by yourself! Roger! Hurry up, move! You fool. Hurry, stand up! I’ll split your head. Roger! Wait for me! You’re tough, aren’t you? Why are you trying to escape? Are you planning something? Don’t worry, Minda, she will turn up. She’s a pain in the ass! Hurry up! Madam Minda. You fucking bitch! Good thing Roger found you! They looked for you everywhere! Lucky you’ve been found! You gave me a big headache! Told you she’ll be back, right? Wait. And who’s this guy? That’s Francis. I told him not to follow me. He works for the mayor. He's supposed to take photos of a flower. A flower, right? - Yes. - Says he’s a photographer. What flower? A photographer? I’ve seen him before. You’re the one who took pictures of us earlier. But I deleted it. Right, Roger? - You’re making me furious. Go inside! - Have pity, please! Francis. - Please no! - Go inside! Stay there! You can't be here. How am I supposed to go back? I don’t know, that's not my problem. I told you to go back. Go on find the flowers on your own! What are we going to do with him? Let’s just lock him up with Angela. - Do it! - Roger! - That’s not my problem anymore. - Talk to the mayor first! Your friend, Roger. Francis? Come here! He’s calling you. Call the mayor, please. Stay there. Enzo! Enzo! Hurry! What is it? Make sure you guard these two. Keep your eyes on them. They musn’t escape. Call your friend. Raven. Let’s guard these two. What do we do? I have a bad feeling about this. You know we'll be in trouble when the Mayor finds out. This man knows nothing now, but what if he finds out? - It’s his fault. - Roger! Get rid of him tomorrow. I’ll take care of it. I’ll go now. Roger. Do something about it. I know when my instincts are telling me something. - Why is he here? - I didn't invite him here. You should have stopped him. He’s persistent. He said the mayor commissioned him for a job. Okay, Oscar. You got a bottle of beer. You’ll pay one hundred. Son of a bitch, you keep hitting it and yet… We can pay half for now, Minda. Alright, how much is this half you’re ready to pay? You’re the one who the most... Three hundred fifty, half. That’s equivalent to how many hits? Here, give this to my mother when you go home. - How much is this? Five thousand? - Yes, don't spend it. Okay, I’ll take care of it. I was just commissioned to take pictures. What the hell happened? What are you doing here? Roger brought me and my sister to this place. Sis, I’m nervous. What are you worried about? Don’t worry, I won’t abandon you, alright? Besides, I’ll be with you. My grandma trusted him so I believed him. It’s all about clearcutting. We have to do any more selective cutting. What are you doing? Make sure everything is on track. - I don't want to get delayed. - Cheers, man. You got this, right? Make sure all our deliveries are on time. Hey, I’ll call you back, Roger’s here. - Hey Roger. - The new girls, they’re here. Good morning! This is Angela and Karla. - Hello! - This is Boss John. - How are you two doing? - We’re okay. Sir, if I may ask, is this the area we’re supposed to clean? You’ll clean all of it. Wait here, I’ll just get something inside. They’re all nice, don’t you worry. These are the friends of my boss, they’ll be here with you. See that? You’ll clean that part. You here, okay? Work hard, don’t embarrass me for bringing you here, okay? Roger. Yes, boss? They’re okay. Thanks, boss. You take care of them. Roger said they were kind, I didn’t know they’d abuse us here. It’s fine, she’s enjoying it. Don't feel bad about this. Please help us. I'm begging you. My sister needs help. When will you set me free? When will you let me go? You don’t like it here? Don’t be like your sister. She ran away, but got caught. Let me see. She needs me. I should be with her. I don’t know what to do. How can I help you? Sis, I’m nervous. I won’t leave you, alright? Besides, I’ll be there with you. Here! Careful, they might hear us. Let’s go get my sister. Okay. That’s the path to your sister! Hurry. Run, quick! Karla. Karla, I’m thirsty. Karla! - Karla’s missing. - What? - What did you say? - Karla’s missing. What happened… Karla? Greg. Karla’s gone. How could she leave when her sister’s here? Her sister’s here… No, she’s gone too! Enzo! Enzo! Roger! Come here! Roger! Hurry! What is it? Find the sisters, or we’ll be in deep shit! Fuck it, hurry up! They can’t have gone far! Angela! Roger, look for them. They can't go that far. Fuck them! When I find them I’m gonna kill them! Where did they go... Roger! This way, boss! She’s there? Run faster! Karla! Angela! They’re there! Let’s go there, quick! Run this way! Come! There they are. Angela! They’re right there! Hurry! Run! Karla! Angela! This way! This way! There! Karla! - Karla! - Go, run! Karla! Run as fast as you can. Keep running! Help! Let's go. Shit. - It’s okay. - No. I’m so afraid of snakes, man. Greg. - Steady, man. - Stop, don’t move! I’m gonna shoot it. I can do this. - Greg, don’t. - Just trust me. I got this. Stop, I’ll shoot it! Wait. Karla! Wake up! Karla! Wake up! Wake up! Karla! Don’t leave me! I don’t want to! Karla! Sir, what can you say about the dead women found in the forest? Ma’am, do you know who they are? What can you say about it? The dead bodies, is that confirmed? Ma’am! Sir! Let's go. Just a bit sir, what can you say about it? - Boss he’s here, you can talk to him now. - Alright. Tina. Tell them I’ll talk to them later, okay? Yes, sir. Ma’am, can we move to the session hall first? Mayor will talk to us there. Mayor will talk to you now. Welcome back. Were you able to take photos of the flowers? Yes, mayor. And... And other things too. Just do what I asked you to do. Or else there will be consequences. Grandma, why? What do you mean? Why did you do that to us? What do you want to do now? What will our future be? If you weren’t such an idiot, your sister would still be alive. What’s so bad about that place? You had food there, we have food here. You want something more. What am I going to do?! Did you even bother to consider our feelings? Do you know what happened to us there? And now she's gone! We have no food? I could always plant vegetables. I can also work in Manila. Why did you do this? Fool! Your sister died because of your stupidity! You would also become a whore in Manila. Idiot. Fool. How are you feeling? It’s the wound. It will be amputated. - Grandma, have you seen my bolo? - No. Where is it? Be strong. Mom, just have this washed. Son, your father has a very high fever. - Let’s take him to the hospital, Mom. - Where will we get the money? Where will we get the money? Mom, I’ll find a way. We’ll take Dad to a hospital. - When? - Just wait, Mom. - Where are you going? - I’m just looking for my bolo. Roger! Wait, Mom. Roger? Roger! Roger! Roger, my son! Who the fuck are you? Help! Please help us! Francis, we must let the world know about this. I’m afraid. What about our children? Francis, don’t be afraid. Our company's legal team will protect us. There’s a safehouse we can go to anytime. We can move there temporarily. We must make this public. Look at those! Francis... Don’t be afraid. I’m here. Your family’s here for you. I have always believed in you. I believe that you’re the same Francis, the same brave man that I know. We can get through this.
