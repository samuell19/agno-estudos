Boss! Please spare me! I planned it carefully. I don't know why it ended up like that. Boss! Boss, please spare me! Boss, please give me another chance! Boss, just another chance! Boss! Please spare me! - Boss, please! - Wait! Boss, please give me another chance. I promise you it will never happen again. - Boss! - Stand up! Stand up! Calm down! It's okay. Okay. - Get out. - Yes. Thank you, Boss. Bye, Big Brother! You can leave now. Daddy! We have a mole. We have to be careful in everything. I know. The next deal... just leave it to me. Your mission is to train the kids. Don't stick your nose... into everything. Yes, Daddy. I got it. My will open the store tomorrow. She will be glad if you come. I just hope that... it's best for her to stay at home. That flower shop... Okay. Let me convince her. And about My and I... I hope you will accept it. I said no. Anyway, we're adopted siblings. Daddy, please. Even if you two are adopted siblings... I forbid it. Enough! Get out! Yes, Daddy. - Ouch! - Are you okay? What the hell with you? Are you blind? Can't you see me? You... You're not bad-looking. Why are you so rude? Hey! Miss... I'm Hong Viet. Are you okay? Just back to Vietnam? I just wanna... Is it hurt? - Hey! - Hey, mister. Excuse me, is the luggage on the ground yours? It's mine. Get ready. Where is the package? Get them! Freeze! It's fake. This is a trap. What? It's a fake deal? Don't point your gun at me. I'm just selling flowers. Is it illegal to sell flowers? Son of a bitch. Withdraw. Congratulations, boss. Lay down! Lay down! Who just shot? No. 152. Come to the scene immediately. Area 2. To find the shooter. Get her. Yes, sir. I saw her go this way. You, you, follow me. Hey, miss. Get her! Hey! You... - Go! - Stop! - Go! - Stop! Stop! Stop! That’s my helmet! Stop it! Hey, what are you doing? Ride on the sidewalk! Stop. Stop! You wanna kill me? Huh? Hey, what the hell are you doing? Airport? You should remember... I'm the one who just saved you. And you didn't even say "thank you." Thank you. You deserved that. If we had hurried... we would have fallen into their trap. A dangerous guy like him still lives outside the law. It's unacceptable. The thing is... why they want to kill Huynh Dai. Who is the killer? This is the information I've just received. Just take a look. This is Huynh Dai. A drug lord in the guise of a businessman. And this is the fake deal. Look at this girl carefully. - What? - It's so scary. Why is this girl wearing red gloves? It's getting more difficult. Not only one but two. We are faced with two forces. Exactly. From now... besides Huynh Dai... we will be faced with another dark force. This mysterious crime is called "The Red Gloves". Guys, we gotta try our best... to find the instigator. - Are you clear? - Yes, sir! Thank you. It was an urgent situation. I'm glad that you're fine. Fine. Take care of yourself. Boss. Be careful. You two stay here. Keep watching carefully. It's me. Daddy had some trouble today. Luckily, he's okay. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. He's home. I'll call you back later. Hi, Daddy. I sent some guys to investigate. They were too focused on drinking today. That's why you're in danger. - It's all my fault. - No more excuses. No matter what... find the killer for me now. Yes, Daddy. Hello. I'm listening. I'm okay. Is it My? Excuse me. Nothing. Okay, don't worry. Okay? Okay. Okay, see you later. Okay, bye bye. Hey! No! Someone's breaking in. Guys, this way! Come on! This way! Why is there always a crowd around you? Hop on! - You wanna call the cops here? - I intend to do that. You idiot! Stop here! Why are you following me? Tell me! Twice... I've almost died because of you. But you... I don't need to know. If you follow me again, I will cut off your legs. Believe it? We can explain it clearly. Can you put this down? Not funny. Actually, you can kill me... without a knife in this situation. I... I like you. Where is this? Hey! Why don't you bring me to my house? I have to go to the hospital. Why are we here? Who will give me first aid? - Who will pull this knife out of me? - Here you are! Hey! You think that I don't know you're pretending? - Huh? - Shut up. Are you a human or a devil? You wanna do it yourself or will I? - Do what? - Glue your mouth shut. You are not human. Only a robot is so cold-hearted. Hey, were humans your enemies in a past life? Shut up or I'll kill you. Understand? Hey! I risked my life for you twice. And you treat me like that? You know I'm injured. I'm bleeding and I need... What are you doing? Eat or not? I don't want to starve to death. Let me tell you something. I'm allergic to noise. And you're too noisy. I dare you to say one more word. How could you be like that? Such a gruff person! Just like the noodles. I said I'm okay. Don't worry. Don't worry? You think I can feel assured? Have you ever thought about my feelings? If things go further today, what should I do, Daddy? Since Mom's death... you're my only relative. I don't want to lose you, Daddy. I understand. But... I can't stop right now. Daddy. I've heard this too many times. I'm glad that you're okay. I’d better go home. My. My. - What the hell are you doing? - Let me help you. Two girls. Looking so hot. - Is it okay? - Of course. Don't worry, my name means strong, honey. Thank you for picking me up. I'm good. Just a minor wound. Glad that you're fine. By the way, come with me to this place. Yes. Little girl. - Stay away! - You'd better stay here. How cute! Such a light-skinned girl! It's all your fault. It's very dangerous here. Why don't you come home with me? Come home with you? Your guys are all the same. Is it okay if only he is out there, Daddy? It's okay. He's used to it. He's very good. He just took a bullet for me. Oh, I forgot. Your guys are really quite something. My! This place is not safe. Stay here and care of her. Yes. I don't like your face. I know kung fu. What are you looking at? Hey! Where are you going? Mr. Dai told me to stay here and protect Miss My. My is taking a shower. What are you protecting in there? If you go in there, it's more dangerous. Can I take a shower now? Okay, take your time. Thank you... for saving my father. It's cold outside. Here. Take it and have a bath. - Wake up! - What are you doing? Very similar to mine. I have to go. Get changed and go home. Hey! What does that mean? Where do you go? You... You can't leave. My wound hasn't healed. You have to be responsible for this. We're all grown up. You can't abandon your child like that. What the fuck did you just say? Who is the child? Who is Mom? Well, anyway, you have to take responsibility for my wound. Okay? What? Stay here if you want to die. Okay? Wait! Don't tell me that... you're afraid of that bunch? Look! It's written all over your face. If you agree... I know a place... that's very safe... and very comfortable. I bet you will like it. No! My father. Dad, I thought you were on vacation. Why did you return? I returned with my wife. What? Your wife? You got married? Where is she? Your mom. Your mom's death anniversary is coming. Did you forget? I'm sorry. You two must be tired. Come in and get some rest. He's wounded. I'm okay. - I'm fine. - What happened to you? Nothing. My girlfriend is just kidding. Such a careless child. Don't know how to take care of yourself. Look at me. Full of energy. - Hey, you're a kid to me. - Yes. A long time without hitting, but you're still strong. You come here. Hey. You two stay at home. - I'll go to the market and buy some stuff. - Okay. Is she your mom? Mom. Look what I bought for you. I love doughnuts the most. Is it yummy? It is yummy. - Let's go inside. - Yes. My mother left me... so suddenly. Here. The last meal. So hot. - Fried carp. - Delicious, right? Yes. These are all my favorite foods. - You cook for yourself every day? - Of course. Gosh! You're so clumsy. - Please. - Thanks. Make yourself at home! Here. You're injured? Here. Eat more beef. And you will have a keloidal scar. That's cool. Daddy, being too handsome is not good. - That's right? - You... You're just good at talking. So... I've been focused on taking care of this kid and forgot about you. Have some, darling. So what's your name? Her name is Bay. Right, Sister Bay? Seven and Bay is the same. English. Vietnamese. I got it. Too many siblings in your house. So... What do your parents do? I don't know who my parents are. Honestly... I don't even know who I am. What is the name of that place? I don't remember. I just remember that... there is a very large yard. Oh my god. There are no orphanages that don't have a yard. Do you remember any other details nearby? Nearby? It's near a railway. Rice field. Railway, rice field. Try to remember. Are there any names? Mrs. Hien. - Yes, it is Mrs. Hien. - Okay! Let's give it a try. Hello. Can you search this information for me? An orphanage. It is near a rice field and a railway. And a person called Mrs. Hien. She has worked for 20 years. Thank you. Do you see them? The buffalo and the stork. I suddenly have a feeling that you and I are just like them. I'm like the stork... always following you. And you're like... the buffalo. Hey. Hey. Don't misunderstand. It is not for you. I just wanna ask. What is this? Then what is this? This is a flower. Finally, I can see you smile. I thought you don't know how to smile. Smile! Smile! Smile again. Come on. Smile! Hey, wait for me. This is the fourth orphanage that has a person called Mrs. Hien. Does it feel familiar? What do you need? Are you okay? I'm fine. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - Are you really okay? - I'm fine. - So I'll continue to play. - Okay. Mrs. Hien. Bang Tam? Are you Bang Tam? It's you. They said... after you went abroad... the fire took your family. I was very worried. The orphanage couldn't find any way to contact you. Bang Tam. I heard she lived somewhere in this building. Let take a look. Come here! This way! Who are you? Cheer up! Cheers! Are you all right? I like the darkness. Cause that is my life. I'm an orphan. And I made so many children become orphans like me. I will definitely pay for that. Come here with me. Whenever I'm sad, I usually come here. Sit here with me. Honestly... we are very alike. Just believe in the things... we see with our own eyes. Have a drink. Why do you like to wear those red gloves? Because there is a lot of blood. I want to hide it. I hate it. Do you know that every time I see my hands, I just wish I had never been born. But don't worry. I'm always by your side. Anytime. Be yourself. Know how to apologize when you hit other people. Know how to say thank you instead of killing the one who saved you. The most important thing is... to know how to treat an injury... more gently. Because it really hurt. Hello. I just received some news. The killers sent someone. But their purpose is still unknown. Maybe it's to complete the mission... that the other guy cannot. No matter what. This is an important unsolved crime... with an international impact. We have to coordinate closely... and provide information quickly in order to avoid serious consequences. Got it. Daddy. It went smoothly. The transaction was successful. What needs reporting is not reported. Huh? How's the killer hunt been going? Well... The kids may have lost track... but I already sent someone to collect more information. Everyone can say these words. Okay. If there's nothing else... You can leave. I have work to do. Why are you still here? Go out and tell Tran Thong... to prepare the car to go with me. Dad! I think this is our family issue... we don't need Tran Thong. Please let me go with you. You also want to stick your nose into what I do and who I meet? No, I didn't mean that. Good. You can leave so I can work. Mom. Today's your death anniversary... I've come to confide in you, Mom. But... I'm the only one here with you right now. I brought you white daisies... your favorite flower. But you're always late. Our child is always the first to come. No wonder the daughter is better than her father. I thought you forgot. You really think I'm that terrible? Stand up, my dear. - What's the matter? - I remember when I was little, you used to tie my shoelaces for me. I still do. - Dad! - Huh? Can you do it for me once and start everything over again? I'm sorry. When your mother was alive, I made her worry. And now you. Then do I have your promise? Promise what? That you won't make me worry. That you will stop what you're doing. Won't you? Daddy. Remember this. Everything I do is for you... for your future, your life. Remember that. Everything? Mom sacrificing her life is what you call everything? Those are just your own excuses. What I need is a father... I need that more than what you call everything. Go take care of her. I upset her. Maybe it's time.... I have to stop. The boss didn't show up again? He did. But I couldn't change his mind. Don't be sad. Can you look after the shop for a minute? I need to go buy some stuff. You can leave. I'm okay. I'm only following your father's orders. He loves you a lot, you know. Mr. Dai told your mother that he'd turn over a new leaf! But you have to.... Stop it! You don't have to tell me that. I know you're all on his side. Miss My... please calm down. There's still time left. Whatever it is... Mr. Dai is still your father. Your only blood relative left. Why did you drive to this place? Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. With Huynh Dai's death... all our efforts are dead too. Not really. I think... Huynh Con will take over. He's even more dangerous than Huynh Dai. While the Huynh family is a mess, we have to quickly find out the secret evidence. What about the international killer? I'll handle it. You're all just gonna sit here mourning? Do something! Do something? What do you suggest we do? Grieving won't bring Mr. Dai back! We each have our own lives. I think Mr. Con should take over Huynh Gia's business. No, he's just a foster son. When Mr. Dai was alive, he wanted Mr. Thong to take over. He just passed away. You all had better act appropriately. For the time being... I'll take over this chair. Do you have anything to say? All of you have to find out the killer... who assassinated my father. Are you clear? Yes, sir. Bang Tam. Bang Tam. Bang Tam. Why would you do that? Everything is over. - I have no choice. - I don't understand. How is it over? How is there no choice? You don't need to understand! Leave and stay out of my business! Go! What are you doing? You've become so weak... because of this guy? It's not funny anymore. You know the rules. Why did you make such a mistake? I killed many assassins who tried to run away from the organization. But I'd never want to kill you. Listen to me. Come back, and I can help you. It's too late! This is the path I chose, and I will walk it. Your path only leads you to death. If it wasn't me, you couldn't get away. But my dream is to be free. I won't be a killing tool for the organization anymore. Are you Vietnamese? I'm Vietnamese too. I know. Thanks for helping me. I'll marry you when I grow up. What do you mean marry? Do I have to fight? No. Marry means we'll live together. But we already live together now. Why do we have to wait until we grow up? Did you do it? Speak Vietnamese! Number Six doesn't deserve that. People like you and me... we have no choice. She didn't do anything wrong. She just messed something up. Failure equals betrayal. The killer who fails twice... is no longer part of the organization. If one day you have to kill me... would you do it? What are you doing here? I... - But why... - Why? I'm the one asking you. Why are you here? - No, My... - How do you know the safe and the code? Were you involved in my father's death? Who are you? Tell me! If you don't talk, I'll scream. This is all fake. Actually... I'm a police officer. I joined your father's force just to uncover everything. I don't want to hurt you. I want to protect you. I need your help. I'll help you. Whatever it is... remember that everything I did is for you. For your future, your life. Leave. Please get out. Where is he? He's gone. - Split up and find him. - Yes, sir. Such a despicable guy. I never thought that your scheme was so cruel. My father... loved you like a son, but you... you're so cruel! Useless bastards! You couldn't even handle an injured guy. If you don't bring him back tonight, don't blame me. Get out! You're just like your father. Don't want gentleness... want me to use violence? - Huh? - What did you do to Daddy? I killed your father. Do you believe it? You don't? I'll show you something. Take a look. Bastard! You're an asshole! Daddy. You believe me now? Daddy. Do you want me to help you meet him? Now you know I'm a bastard? That's what your father did! Tran Thong! Tran Thong! Tran Thong! Tran Thong! Damn it. Tran Thong! Tran Thong! Don't! Don't! Don't wake a sleeping dog! Tran Thong! Eradicate all of them! Tran Thong! Tran Thong! All the evidence is in... In where? In where? Tran Thong! Tran Thong! What are you saying? Tran Thong... Fight for justice. A noble sacrifice. No pain is forever. Tran Thong is still alive in our hearts. Don't let his death be for nothing. Bang Tam has changed. But she needs more time to divulge information to us. There is not enough proof to accuse Huynh's family. Huynh Con is the most questionable one. I heard that Huynh Con is related to the assassin who killed Huynh Dai. This guy will replace Bang Tam and kill her. We need Tran Thong's evidence to bring this case to light. Huynh Con and those sinners will soon be punished by the law. We will make an action plan. All evidence is in... In where? Tran Thong hid the USB in the table... before leaving Huynh Gia. Huynh Con has dispersed and hid Huynh Dai's property. He's gonna cross the border tonight. To start the new empire. Now, our mission is to find that USB. Okay? Hey! Where are you going? Who are you? You're a cop, aren't you? Do you know how insipid you are? You talk bullshit all the time. Is it necessary to save a person... who deserved to be punished for murder? You pretend to be a fool. Okay. You got me. So what? Your teammates are out there fighting for what they believe. Everybody is waiting for your result. Please don't stay here playing around with me. Go. Go where? There are things... - only insiders... - Have you ever had this feeling? So... Actually... I've had it many times. But... in a situation like this... not yet. What do you want? Watch her. You're so cool. But still fooled by you. Get ready! Attention! The target is dangerous. Be careful! You're surrounded. Surrender immediately. I repeat. You're surrounded. Surrender immediately! Stay there! Sit down! Go! Go! There is only one result for the traitor. Hands up! Freeze! You're surrounded. Catch them. Don't do it, give it up. We can start again. Everything isn't over. Unless I die. I'll marry you when I grow up. What do you mean marry? Do I have to fight? Freeze! Be careful, come here. Go! It hurts. Come on. Many people died because of you. - Hong Viet. - It's your fault. - Asshole. - Calm down. - Don't. - Wanna shoot me? Do it! Do it! Calm down. Bring him out. Go, go. All crime... will be punished by the law. Everything ended. Huynh Con was punished by the law. He has to pay for his sins. No.3 has been caught... he will regret for the rest of his life what he did to her. Huynh Gia's company is not an illicit business anymore. Huynh My has returned to reestablish her father's business in a better way. I'm like the stork I keep following you. And you're like... the buffalo. I saw you smile. I thought you didn't know how to smile. Thong! Do you know that everybody here misses you? We can't solve this case without you. But there is one thing I have not done... at this place. Go play with your friends. Yes. What's wrong, darling? Thanks for your gift. This is Ms. Bang Tam's gift. But where is Ms. Bang Tam? Why she doesn't come and play with us? Ms. Bang Tam is busy, so I came to play with you. She said that you had to study hard and listen to your mom. Yes.
