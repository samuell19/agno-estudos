The code of the savage. The Council of the Elders are meeting to decide which of the younger warriors shall be sent out after the lions. Most of the younger warriors wear headdresses made from the manes of the lion they have killed. Their faces, legs, and chests are painted red, yellow, and white with a substance made from the ashes of previously killed lions. For now, the main master of the wild, the terror that stalks by night, this grim lord of slaughter is to meet his doom at the hands of the only foe who dare molest him, or the man who steps back in the face of a charge is forever branded a coward. The crowded moment begin. The leader plunges his spear into the beast. He's down. His shield protects him. He's up again. Not a man will step back. Look out. There's another one. Look out! He's got an-other one. Quick as lightning, the white spears clash again. Even if he falls to his death, he fights with the spears. Strange to say, the victors appear unhappy over their victory, for the lion is a symbol to them of everything great, and they worship his power with deep respect. Shit. Piece of shit. I mean... Piece of shit. Do you think the world's going to change because it's getting warmer? It'll get cooler. It'll get warmer. It's called weather. Yeah, I think it's a big scam for a lot of people to make a lot of money. In the meantime, China is eating our lunch. I love the idea of solar, and then I do a test, and you get your money back in 36 years. The problem is you got to make it economically viable, Bill. Right now, it's not economically viable. And if it were, then somebody would be marketing it. That's for sure. - Hi, how are you doing? - Good. How are you? - I'm doing great. - Good. How did we become the richest, most powerful country in only 200 years? I guess you can always argue that there's more than one way to skin a cat, but... I'll just go ahead and stick with capitalism and my second amendment rights. What's Richard's flight schedule tomorrow But it's just like, I mean, I just can't even tell you how fucking mad I am, you know. It's like, "Come on, people." I mean this is why you don't do this stuff, you know. This is-- I'm sitting here. Anyway, so... I mean. - Hey. - Hi. Got everything organized? Yeah. What are you doing? You getting your nails done? - Yes. - Oh, good heavens. Yeah, got to get them done for the Fourth. - Please take care of my grizzly bear. Okay? - He's good. - Are you sure? - Yes, I bought him a new toy today. Okay, I'm worried about my grizzly bear. I think you worry about him more than me. I worry about my dog very much. Yes. - He's the love of my life. - Really? We're do I fall? Well I mean, you're right there, baby, but I'm just saying. Okay? Alright. Okay, talk to you later. - Okay, Love you, - Love you too. Bye, bye. Bye. Yeah. Man, oh man. I am just over the moon with this. Look at that big tuft he's got there on his elbow. That is what you call a big-maned Tanzania lion, baby. Chris, this thing is a stud. When I saw him come out, it only took but a second. Yeah, this here was... It was a big day for me. "Uh, You are one sick, twisted individual that takes great pleasure in killing beautiful animals like the lion in the video. I'm going to ask for your picture to be put across the world wide web in the hope that someone will stop you, period. If they don't, then you deserve to die a very slow, painful death, a stroke where you're paralyzed would be justice for what you're doing. I bet you are a sexual sadist. That is why you like to kill innocent animals because it gets you hard, sick fuck. Those innocent animals don't need to die because of your disgusting sexual fetish, you freak. Leave them alone." I mean, where do you-- where do you get sexual deviation, uh, from going hunting? You know when I say that... And people might think that it sounds tongue in cheek when I say that it brings me to tears, but that's really not true. It does. You know, the... It's hard to put into words, really, the feelings that I have for the lion, and it's a shame that people won't take the time to recognize the importance that all of us can bring to their protection, including the hunters. You know, and oftentimes... You know I get mad, and I'm a very type A personality, and I think people who know me see that. I lift weights, and I'm aggressive, and that sort of thing, but, you know, to get to know me and understand my real feelings for the wildlife there, would give somebody a different perspective on-- on what I believe and what I stand for. And not just me, but a lot of us. And that's why I get so frustrated that a lot of the people on the flip side of our coin you know, bash what we do and think we're there just to harm, and to rape, and pillage the wildlife, and the people, and the territory, and stuff, but, when nothing's further from the truth. I mean, you have to come there. You have to experience it. Stop telling me what you think you know. Come there and see it for yourself. You speak English. - She's funny. - Come on. baby. Too much dead grass. This dead grass is not good food for anything. There's nothing that eats it. What we do this time of year, we burn all of it, and within a week or 10 days, all the new growth comes, and it's much better, much more nutritious for all the animals, and it's better for the bush. Yeah. I'm just going to find something to shoot. Yeah, all right. Find something to kill. He said better make another plan to try and find a hippo when You've got time, and rather just go and whack a zebra. He said you should see a zebra, just to make sure we get a bait of today because if we don't find one, then we're screwed, you know? My role here is to make sure that during hunting activities, all the rules and regulation are followed. The trophy fee is quite expensive, $3,000, $4,000. We don't really want to shoot one of those for bait because it's such an expensive animal. We'd rather shoot something more cheap. We'd rather shoot something like a hippo. It's much cheaper, much more bait. Desperation is getting bad already. You'll have to start using cameramen. We've got plenty of them. - You got to hang around, hang around. Just a lot of bad luck this morning, really. Most people in the world think that the wilderness is like Serengeti National Park where there are millions of animals, but in the reality is that places like Serengeti may be 5% of what goes on in Africa. The rest of Africa is different from Serengeti. The reality is more like what we are seeing, where people live, and people-- There's conflict with people and animals, and you see the people cut the trees down, and they destroy the habitat. That's more the reality in Africa than a national park. A national park is a fairly artificial environment. They put a big border around it, and they protect it. But the rest of Africa's not like that. Populations of people increase every year. Every year they extend their villages further and further into the bush. There's less area for the animals to live. There's more poaching. It's not all good news for the animals. Lots of candy. We give candy to the kids. There you go. She saw a lion. Sometimes she's moving from one village to another village. She saw a lion, but all the younger ones, they haven't yet seen any lions. It's a delicate line you walk because as hunters, we want to maintain this are as a hunting area. As people, they want to look at it, and say: "Oh, there's some forest. There's some land. I can go and plant some stuff," so there's always that little bit of tension, you know. but overall they see us as a beneficiary here because we employ some of these guys in the camps and their families, you know. They're forever criticizing colonialism, and the white man, and what he did, and... but then I always say, Well, okay. The very man who's criticizing it is standing in a three-piece suit, wearing a tie, black shoes, belt. He woke up in a house of bricks and tiles with electricity and piped water, and he picks up his cell phone, and he cooks his breakfast in a toaster. Every single thing he does, from there, getting in his car, going on a blacktopped road to the office, you know. Turning on a computer... Everything there came from the Western world. So, he's utilizing everything that's Western, and he wants to be in that zone. That's the conflict. Yeah, Africa's very confused, you know. They have this conflict, internal conflict. Hard thing for the Western world to understand as well. Very, very ancient technology, passed down from father to son. - This is bush technology here. - Yeah. You don't have a tractor with a When you don't have a trailer, this is what you do. I love the sound of the glass. The sound of the African bush. - It might be a little strong. - What do you want? Some Red Label? Wash the dust off. Did some bush bashing today. - Cheers, guys. - Cheers. - Good day. - see a leopard. Yeah, it was cool seeing a leopard today. O-oh, well, that was a bad idea. Been a certain place. Guys says you have a big nose. Puts his fucking drink down, you know. - O-oh - Unless he put's his drink down. - That's a problem. - Okay. Grabbed him by his head, boff, headbutted him, bwak, down on the ground, - grabs him by-- - That headbutt will get you. Grabs him by his hair, walks him to the door. It's like on the second floor, so there's a set of stairs, fuck, drags him by his hair to the door. This guy's out. I mean, his eyes-- eyes are like... You know? Drags him to the steps, pushes him over, fucking kicks him. He rolls down three steps, comes back, picks up his drink. He says: "Shit, sorry about that. Uh, What were we saying?" There's like blood on the roof, and there's blood on the walls. He's talking about the guy that was convicted for murder and put in jail, P.H. Went to prison for like fighting? - No, he went to prison for murder. - Oh. Shoot. - Ten years. - Yeah, but... They said he smoked a fucking poacher. - Didn't Georgie smoke a poacher? - Aaron] Yeah, Georgie Ferrera - smoked a fucking poacher as big as Dallas two years ago. - Cliffi's, you know. Cliff House? Oh, I didn't know that. This poacher, I mean, dude, he came up and levelled a gun at Georgie, just levelled his 500 and, dou, smoked the guy. There's no issue with it. It isn't an issue. Yeah, I'm not shooting anybody. When Sammie opened in 2003, I mean, we were literally in a shootout back and forth. I was like: "Holy fucking shit. Where did I sign up for this bullshit?" The vultures were circling their camp. We went there, and I mean. And that's when we found... Man, that was back in the days of, you know just three-chip color digital, just standard def, you know, wasn't even... But I had a camera, and I videoed it all, and we found 150 dead animals. What they do is they smoke it. I mean basically turned it into jerky. They call it biltong here, but you basically-- For some reason, I pictured fresh, you know steaks, and their steak's shit. - I couldn't even sell that. - They get these monkeys and shit, and they smoke them. So, yeah. I mean, it still looks like a monkey, but it's smoked and mummified. - Yeah. - And they just-- Yeah, you go and buy the smoked monkey. And The truth is, I actually like the biltong here. But You know, they dry it, or salt it, or smoke it, or whatever. And then, later, they go and put it in a pot with boiling water, and they reconstitute it and then eat it like that. Yeah, I like it. I do like those scopes. He says that he heard buffalo, yeah, the herd. Can you see my... It 's right there. - That must be why he brought his gun. - Huh? That must be why he brought the gun. So, they're trying to find... You see him, bro? Up to the left. There's one looking right at us. See the one looking right at us? Oh, man. That's him. What? Fucking nightmare. One nice buffalo here. You just gotta tell me when. Yeah, this one bullet in a perfect area. You know, animals, when you shoot them, they don't struggle. They-- They just got-- get a sudden-- sudden death, which is fine. Yeah. Well, we've come back to this guy. We think that other one's gone over there in the grass. And so, It's getting late, so it's probably not too wise to push it into the grass. Let me do that again. It'll be better if you hold the motherfucker still. Yeah, you've got to find a way - to brace better, or something. - That's fatigue. from been doing it for-- how long? I mean, I was... Happy days, boys. The best part of the buffalo right there. Yeah, there we go, splat. Beautiful. Very tasty. Two days' time, on the cold, filled in pepper, one glass of red wine. Yeah, that's gonna be good. A big male could eat higher than I could reach. He just stands up on his back legs and he could eat way up here. Way up here. I mean, they're big, they're huge, Because he could eat all this, he could eat most of this, no problem. - It's little bit lower. - it's a little bit low. - but we're gonna change it tomorrow. - Yeah. Yeah, if he comes and gets a fill of this, he ain't going nowhere. That's right. Look out. Oh, you don't want that on you. Nuh-uh. Bad stuff. Is the shit-slinging done yet? Nuh-uh, look out. Look out. You kill a couple buffalos, you get a lion, you get a leopard. You have them taxidermized. You're probable looking at what? - 150, 175 thousand. - You're certainly looking well over a hundred. The most expensive companies in Tanzania are over a hundred thousand dollars before you even have any kind of success. If you're gonna kill a lion, this is the kinda lion you need to kill. Must be six or greater, must be on its own, must not be in a pride, must not have cubs. There's a whole set of guidelines and for people like myself and Aaron, who-- we have the lions' interests at heart, we truly do. You know, You don't just do that if you don't care about it and I care about doing it right and doing it properly and I mean that's what this is all about. Statistically, right, no, you probably won't get one, but you bought yourself a lion hunt, and you'll go home having hunted lions. A couple of hyenas, feeding here last night. Jumping up, latching on, pulling off. Sometimes you get a moment when the light hits the grass just right or the light goes through the leaves of a tree and it looks really nice. So you've got to take a picture cause this is... This is film nature is a character, so, I mean, you have to be able to capture those moments when there's beautiful things. I think that probably should, that's pretty square. - This things are all pretty wide, wide angle. - Yeah. Yeah, we'll see tomorrow if we don't get some pics we'll move it again. It should be fine. Alright, let's rock and roll. Fuck. Fucking shit. Fuck. I mean that's a perfect shot. That buffalo shouldn't have gone 200 yards and fell over stone dead. That's the same piece that would have robbed the fucking dog shit out of me. Hand me that gun, will you? Just-- At least we found it so we know that it's terminated. It's not good to find it too late like this. Yeah, I mean He's not really getting that reflector on me. Yeah, I mean it's okay. Oh, I know, but I don't want just okay. Yeah see the reflector's not even on me. See if maybe we can get Dean to hold it. Yeah. maybe just up a little bit. Up a little bit higher. No, you-- up higher. We want it just a little bit higher, just a little bit higher. - Morning. - Morning. Everybody sleep okay? Well, I wasn't dreaming I was covered in ants, yeah. You're still covered in ants? That lets you know that you're alive. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Morning, boys. - How you doing man? Well, well, well. Good, good, good. I was born funny, dude. Haven't you noticed that? When you're that ugly you gotta be something. That's right. When you gotta a face for radio, you gotta come up with some good lines. Face for radio, dreams for TV. Live a little in the mean-time. - Or a lot. - Live a lot in the mean-time. Well, let's see what kind of trouble we can get into today. Yeah, I'd like to see a big lion on bait. - That'd be alright. - The baits are in good places, it's a waiting game. If they were easy to kill, then we'd sell them on five day hunts six days hunt. It's 21 day hunt for a reason. - It's a leopard. - Claw marks on the tree. Yeah, you can see the leopard. That's a big female or a young male, it's not very big. It's the way it goes. They can drive you crazy these why didn't you do it? He gets so frustrated, you know, checking. Why didn't he come? Why did-- He says boss: "He's got four legs, we've got two." It's a simple explanation. He'll do what he wants to do, he's an animal. That water looks really tasty. - M-hm. How big does a big male leopard get? Around here, probably 150, 160 pounds. But a big male lion's 3, 4? Oh no, he's probably a big male lion, 450 pounds. - It's a big cat. - It's a big cat. The worst thing that can ever happen is vultures find your bait. It's very frustrating. In America, that's what I do there. I've been a hunting guide for 24 years. So, I've guided lots of-- lots of hunters, so... - Does it pay there, over there? - Does it what? - Pay. - Yeah. - More than here? - Uh. You know, It all depends, I mean, some places yeah, some places, no. Yeah, it just all depends. So, where I live we have elk and deer and big horned sheep and goats and mountain lions, you know, and all that stuff. But I live up in the mountains. It's very pretty, but it's cold. But it's very pretty. You know, in our country where you have, you know, only a 10% unemployment rate, You know, so 90% of the people have jobs, you know, they don't need to go live off the land, and live off the wildlife, you know? So, we can still continue to protect our wild places and wildlife resources. Here, I understand it's a different story, man. I do. Look I've seen it, I know, I understand, but gosh damn, I hate to see the wildlife and the wild lands, you know be the loser. But, eventually they're gonna be the loser. Because the people are gonna win. He doesn't have a great big mane. But I mean he has big shoulders, big, I mean-- he's not streamlined. He has big shoulders and big back. I promise you, I could have shot that lion, that's not what it is about. We're going to try to get them on bait, try to get a better assessment, try to get a better closer look at him. I mean, you want to try to get a good assessment before you just start shooting. I mean, I think that was a prime example of people thinking we just wire a wire through the bush and if a lion jumps out, we smoke him. Well, that's not the way it works. Hey watch, be careful, he's known. A little different than a buffalo, that's for sure. What we came for. I was still walking in the dark in the early morning, and the two male lions started fighting to my left, close, close, close in the dark. I don't know why they started fighting, but all of a sudden they started fighting. And then-- I mean, the sound was un believable, You know, you need to record that early in the morning when it's quiet. But, same, in the dark right here, fighting. They were mad. Could you have the chef in the future not put the tuna fish on the bread? You want it separate? Do you want some other? No. I mean, I don't really like tuna fish, so... Goddamn it, get the fuck off of me. But he can bring you some normal bread if you want. No, it's fine, it's fine. I've had seven wounded lions that I've had to follow. When you know they're aliv e and you've still got to go and find them, I've had seven, and only two of them charged. Some lions don't always charge, you know. They call them cowardly lions, but I don't like that word. It's not a cowardly lion, it's just-- But, yeah, not all of them have it in them to charge, but still, when you get the one that does, it's incredibly intimidating. If you consider the combination of speed and aggression and strength-- Mm-hmm. That combination and the fact that they can hide in the bush and you don't see them until-- you know, it's my least favorite for sure. Yeah. Waiting for the hippo to show himself. It's not a lot of fun. It's boring. You realize by the time this thing comes out of the water it's probably going to be close to dark. - It's 6:30. - Well I don't care what time it is, I'm just talking about light-wise. When they don't move like that, he's lying dead on the bottom in the sand. Yeah, we'll come in the morning and find him. Have you heard of that group Tanzanians for Wildlife? They were petitioning Tanzanian Wildlife Department to not issue me a visa to enter the country. There's some pieces of shit around the place. But the thing I saw on TV, there are these elephants walking in a field, and there's a female elephant, and then they're all grouped together, and they start trying to run, and they're grouping and the next minute you see a gun barrel, and you see a bullet come out of the gun barrel. And as it hits one of the elephants, the picture sort of dissolves and turns into a woman with two or three kids. - Oh, fuck. - Right. and she's now running in the field and they're all scared and she's holding the kids, you know? And off they go. And it's basically, you know, so flipping well done, and it's Hollywood-ed that someone sitting in a chair is gonna: "Oh, my god, shame, - is that what it's like?". - Yeah, they just shot a family. They just a family, they just a shot her daughter. - And that's what they do. - M-hm. They sway the mindset of people, that middle chunk of population who don't know any better. And we as hunters-- I'm telling you now, if we don't start doing the same Hollywood-ed up... Everybody thinks banning hunting is going to save wildlife, - Yeah. - And the reverse is 100% the case. You've been here for a week now, you've seen anybody else out here? Ain't anybody else out here. You think someone is going to come here and pay you for a photographic safari? You think when Sammy Glitchbottom and his wife and his 2.5 kids rock up from Indianapolis, Indiana, with their safari hat on... he's got a safari hat. How quickly do you think that the wife is giving the husband one of these and saying: "You get us the hell out of here, and I mean now". About the third time the nine year old is screaming "mommy, the flies are killing me". Boom! Definitely it's true. There is only one source of revenue in the entire country of Tanzania, for the Tanzanian Wildlife Department. And that is hunting dollars. Period, end of story. Yourself for example. Coming on this safari, you're supporting me, you're supporting Dean, you're supporting all the trackers, 20-30 staff, that come in here and set up the camps every year. The admin in town, all their families, the game scouts that-- and the anti-poaching guys. The pyramid is like this, by one guy coming on this safari. Cause it gives value to wildlife, it gives you a reason to look after them. You know, if they don't have a reason to look after wildlife, why look after them? You don't. We look at it, wildlife from a different perspective from what black people look at it as. Why it sits there for our entertainment and enjoyment. But, there's got to be a bigger reason to look after it, and they've got a benefit like Aaron says. They have to benefit from it, it's not just for our luxury purposes. These people that live out here, they're not saving money for retirement, they're not worried about their golf, you know, their golf house in Florida. They are simply worried about, "how do I feed my family today". These guys don't think past tomorrow. That don't mean that because they're not capable of thinking past tomorrow, it's because they live in the moment because today they've got to eat today. It's how it is. Yeah, that's reality. It's not negative, it's reality. It's unfortunate, but it's the case. His blood is shattered everywhere. As soon as it hits this rock, it's going to be as far as it's going to go. - You never surfed a day in your life. - Nope. I have now. Surfed on a hippo. That's a hell of a way to start the morning. See if it's anything for Tanzania star. - I probably won't put the surfing picture on Facebook. - No? That's a damn shame. They wanted push-ups, squats, flutter kicks, and burpees. - It's hard. - Oh, that would kick your ass. Gotta get down. Gotta get down. Get your chest on the ground. - How is it on your hands? - It's not bad. My feet hurt a little more. Oh, yeah? But you'll see, I mean, when I'm at the lion, I mean I'll give him, you know, a moment of silence and... That's killing. No doubt about it. You're going to kill him. But you know, part of it is unexplainable. Too much of what you see in the United States... That-- They don't represent, you know, the way things really are. Simba doesn't have a name, you know. He's not Simba. You know, the warthog isn't Pumbaa and all the other cast of characters in The Lion King and such, I mean. They're not buddies. They don't hang out. They don't dance and run around and throw parties together. I mean, when Simba sees Pumbaa, my friend, I assure you, he's killing him as fast as he can and he's doing everything he can to kill him. And he's killing him in any way possible. It's about survival out here. Period. A lion is a killing machine. That is what he does. That is all he does. He kills. That's how he survives and that's all he knows. That would chase the flies away, for sure. They're already gone. The only dream I've had of a lion, was when I was on a bedtime malaria medication. I was outside of the truck. My buddy was in the back of the truck. The lion jumped into the back of the truck to attack him, and I had my gun. So, instead of shooting the lion to save my buddy, I just shot my buddy in the head. - I mean it's was like, what? - A little mercy killing. Yeah. I guess I... Oh, yeah, you're screwed. Something deep down in the very core of this dream is just that Aaron is an asshole. He wants to kill all his friends. I mean, I've been told I'm an asshole by many people. That is not something new. He kills all the other lion hunters, then he will be left the last and best hunter. That's right. If you can't beat your competition, kill them. Eliminate them. We have to try to shoot one in the next two days. We need to shoot it while we still got some hippo meat left. That is really good. Six o'clock last one. - That's a good picture. - Yeah. Big lion. Big Simba. Very long mane hair. That's nine, ten inches long that thing. That's good hair. Very good hair. A deep thinking hunter. One that doesn't necessarily... shoot every animal he sees. I'd say that, that shot kind of will portray him in a way that it shows the thought process of what happens when he sees an animal. He'll sit there and he thinks about it and he contemplates it and goes through, you know, the qualifications of what is shooting animal. So, a shot like that kind of... just, you know-- It's a good light. It helps the viewer to, you know, see him in an intimate way. The way that he looks at the animal before he takes it, so. Hopefully we can get that across. Got him! This lion is not afraid of us. I mean it's 50 meters. He's not afraid. Completely, not afraid. From the backside, it seems to be a big lion. He's very happy. I'll just kill hill. I just wanted you to have a quick... It's a pretty cat, though. Pretty animal. It ain't going to be pretty. No, he's going to be angry. It should go south pretty fast, you know. One second, everything's under control. Next thing is it's fucking haywire. When that lion's looking at you with those yellow eyes. You know, they look through you. And you can-- you feel the presence that is that animal. And it's special. My father took me hunting for the first time when I was eight years, nine, whatever I was. Eight or nine years old. He didn't have to make me want to be a hunter. That first time I went, I was-- it-- I was hooked like I was hooked on the strongest drug you've ever seen. And I believe that to be one thing. Instinct. Just because some people on earth choose to suppress that, don't think it's not in your DNA because you're lying to yourself. 'Cause it is. Man is the ultimate predator. Man will determine the outcome of the lion. Man will determine the outcome of every wild living thing on this planet. Man rules the world. Uh, I think today we are going to get a lion, 'cause we have prepared it-- we have prepared it a lot, so it's time to get it. Yeah, that's what I feel. What kind of light do you have? Watching. I can't get him to stand up. I can't shoot him laying down. It's just a bad shot. I don't even know what to say. He's just fucking sleeping over there now. Range. Here we go. - Quick, to do, to do. - Yeah, yeah. - We did it, man. - The first one was perfect. Yeah. We did it. Well done. Wild-- wild lion with a bow. Wild lion with a bow. Well done, Aaron. Thank you. Oh, man. Man, what a morning, eh? - Jeez, Louise. - Yeah. I'm glad we didn't just get in there and whack him. I'm glad we sat and watched him and, you know appreciated him for a bit too. You know, I-- I don't feel bad. I feel remorseful for the life, but, I love for-- I love it for what I do and I love it for the opportunity that the good lord gives us to do this and allows us to hunt these things. And especially the lion. Wow. Alright, let's... Hang on a second. Do we need to do that again? - Well done. Well done. - Thank you. Man that was a beautiful old lion there. Really. - Yeah, it is. - Well. Yeah, that's the-- That's an old bugger, man there's no doubt. - That is exactly what we needed. Six-foot. - Oh, man. - You shot him so well. - That's amazing. Simba. Woo! Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Thank you very much. We were expecting a gun. - They were listening for gunshots. - One of you was calling. - There was no gunshot. - There was no gunshot.

Very, very important to be respectful to the animal at all stages. You know, even when you load them, you want to load it nice. You don't want to just throw it off the tailgate when you get back to the skinning shed. You don't want to throw it off and dump him on the ground. You know, you want to be respectful at all times to them, you know. It's still, you know, an old animal and a beautiful animal. And Yeah, respect them. Hold that. Oh, shit, it's quite heavy. Aaron, come check these babies out, Aaron. Ok, Let me see. Watch out guys. Oh yeah, look at that. If that thing licked you, it would tear your skin off. Just by licking you. It's for licking meat. They can lick meat off the bone. Yeah. Look it has tiny little teeth in its tongue Look at that. - Yeah, but, man that's a real indication... - That's cool.

That came out pretty cool, dude. That was great, the way he was watching us, you know. He's sitting there and he's doing... - That was pretty funny. - Did you see when he closed his eyes? Eyes closed, oh my god, he's going to sleep. Yeah. Once he started licking his face and stuff, though I figured it's not gonna be much longer now, 'cause it looks like his mouth's getting dry. He's getting bored. He's thirsty. I'll bet you a hundred dollars he was going to get up, look around a bit... "yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's cool." He was going to walk and go get a drink, then he was going to lay down and go to sleep. This is the shipping instructions. We have the lion skull. The lion's full skin.
