NORA: OH, WAIT TILL WE'’RE FAR AWAY FROM MY LAND. WE SENT A WIRE FROM THE SHIP, OUT IN THE DARK SEA, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. MAN: I WON'’T BE GOING, NORA. MICHAEL, YOU'’LL GET BETTER WHERE IT'’S BRIGHT AND WARM. I SWEAR TO YOU. YOU CAN'’T BE KEPT IN ANYWHERE, CAN YOU? JESUS, I'’LL KNOCK IT OFF OF YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL. GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME. YOU'’RE NOT MY DAD. -NORA, YOU'’RE SHAMING US IN FRONT OF-- -STOP, UNCLE TOMMY. IT'’S THE CONVENT FOR YOU, GIRL. -TOMMY, NO. DON'’T TOUCH HER. -YOU'’LL FIND IT SO EASY TO GET OVER THAT PLACE! -GET OUT! GET OUT! -[INDISTINCT CHATTERS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] [NORA SCREAMING] WOMAN: THERE'’S NOTHING LEFT TO PAWN. -THIS CAN'’T BE THAT BAD. -HOW DID YOU KNOW? YOU NEVER COME HOME ANYMORE. I'’LL BE COMING HOME, THEN I'’M GONNA BE GONE FURTHER AWAY. IT'’S TRUE, THEN WHAT STANI SAYS. YOU'’RE THINKING OF LEAVING IRELAND. STANI EVEN KNOWS WHAT I'’M THINKING NOW, DOES HE? TAKE ME WITH YOU IF YOU GO, WILL YOU? -I'’M GOING NOWHERE. -YOU HAD EVERYTHING, JIM. AND YOU'’RE THE BROTHER WHO WOULD HELP HIS FAMILY. I HAVE TO GO NOW, EVA. I'’LL CALL UP THE HOUSE LATER. I'’D SAY YOU'RE NOT FROM HERE. ARE YOU UP FOR A VISIT? -I COULD SHOW YOU AROUND DUBLIN. -SORRY, FELLOW, I HAVE TO WORK. YOU'’RE FROM GALWAY. WHERE WOULD YOU SAY I'’M FROM? I DON'’T KNOW. -SWEDEN. -SWEDEN? YEAH, YOU'’RE LIKE A SWEDISH SAILOR WITH YOUR BLUE EYES. -THEY ARE VERY SHORT-SIGHTED. -SWEDISH SAILORS ARE. -NO, MY EYES. -[CHUCKLES] OH, I SEE THESE ARE THE ONLY ONES TO SEE. SO I CAN SHOW YOU THE CITY. WELL, I'’M ABLE TO SHOW MYSELF THE CITY. TONIGHT, I COULD MEET YOU. I'’M BUSY, SORRY, I WORK IN FINN'’S. -TOMORROW? -I'’M WORKING THEN, TOO. -RIGHT. -WEDNESDAY, I CAN DO A SWAP. -YES, ALL RIGHT, ABOUT 8:30. -YEAH, WHERE? -WELL, I'’LL COLLECT YOU. -NO, DON'’T DO THAT. IN THE CORNER OF MERRION SQUARE, SO DO YOU KNOW IT? THE CANAL? THERE'’S A SEATING AT THE BRIDGE. GOOD, GRANTED. I'’LL SEE YOU THERE. OH, AND MY NAME IS JAMES JOYCE. -HEY, JAMES JOYCE? -WHAT? -DON'’T YOU WANT TO KNOW MY NAME? -OH, GOD, SORRY. -NORA BARNACLE. -NORA. -GOOD, LIKE IBSEN. -WHAT? WHAT'’S IBSEN? I'’LL SEE YOU WEDNESDAY, NORA. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'’RE GOING? UH, IT'’S ALL RIGHT. I SWAPPED WITH ELLEN. DID YOU NOW? WELL, YOU CAN GO BACK TO WORK AND TELL ELLEN TO TAKE HER EVENING OFF. -WHY? -YOU SEEMED TO THINK THAT YOU CAN COME AND GO AS YOU PLEASE, MS. BARNACLE? NOW GO AND DO YOUR WORK. BUT I DON'’T SEE WHY I CAN'’T DO THAT IN SHIFT? SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, I FIND THAT THIS SORT OF WORK JUST DOESN'’T SUIT CERTAIN KINDS OF GIRLS. "ALL I WANT, ALL I WANT," SAYS HE, "IS TIME AND SPACE TO WRITE THE BETTER PEOPLE WHO BETRAYED ME, AND WHO SENT ME INTO EXILE IN MY OWN LAND." WILL YOU PAY ME AND GO? I HAVE TO LOCK-OFF. YOUR TURN, I THINK, COSGRAVE? -COME ON. -IT'’S ALWAYS ME WHO'S CAUGHT. COME ON, COSGRAVE. WE HAVE MORE THINGS TO DO. I'’M MUCH TOO NICE FOR THIS LITTLE HAND, EH? YEAH, SURE, YEAH. LET ME SEE. HOLD IT WITH THAT NICE LITTLE HAND OF YOURS, PLEASE? STOP MESSING, WILL YOU? JOYCE? JUST IN TIME. WERE YOU LOOKING FOR US? I DON'’T NEED TO LOOK FOR YOU, GOGARTY. I CAN SMELL YOU OUT. WE'’RE GOING AROUND TO MRS. MACKS. -ARE YOU COMING? -NO MONEY. OH, COME ON. SHE'’LL UNDERSTAND YOU. WELL, IN THAT CASE, YOU'’RE A TRUE SON OF ERIN, AND IT'’D BE TREACHEROUS FOR ME TO LET YOU DOWN. HOPE YOU'’RE NOT TOO ANNOYED. JAMES: I'’VE WAITED FOR HOURS, BUT I COULD NOT SEE YOU. PERHAPS I'’M TOO SHORT-SIGHTED. IT'’S PROBABLY FOOLISH OF ME TO WRITE YOU NOW, BUT I HOPE YOU REMEMBER ME. -MS. BARNACLE? -MR. JOYCE. [MOANS] TOUCH ME, TOUCH ME. [MOANS] DO YOU HAVE A HANKIE, MR. JOYCE? -I BETTER GO IN. -UH, NO, NOT YET. -YOU'’RE NOT FRIGHTENED OF THEM, ARE YOU? -NO. MS. BARNACLE, THIS IS MR. COSGRAVE, MR. GOGARTY, AND MY YOUNGER BROTHER, STANI. WE'’VE MET. ENJOY YOUR NIGHT-OFF, MS. BARNACLE. HAVING AN EARLY NIGHT YOURSELF, GENTLEMEN? WELL, I'’LL SAY ONE THING FOR THE BARD ANYHOW. HE'’S NOT A SNOB, IS HE? YOU THINK I DON'’T RESPECT YOU AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT? NORA, BELIEVE ME, IT WAS SACRED FOR ME. YOU DON'’T UNDERSTAND ME, BUT YOU WILL. IT'’S BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY JUST MET. IT'’S THIS FEELING WHEN PEOPLE PUT THEIR MOUTHS TOGETHER LIKE THIS. -WHY? -WHY WHAT? WHY IS IT ALL RIGHT FOR YOU TO TOUCH ME AND I CAN'’T TOUCH YOU? BECAUSE I'’M BETTER AT IT THAN YOU ARE. I LOVE YOU, JIM. YOU SAY THAT, BUT I NEED MORE THAN YOUR EMBRACES, NORA. I WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE, OR YOU'’RE RIGHT TO ME. I WANT TO KNOW YOUR SECRET THOUGHTS. I HAVE NO SECRET THOUGHTS. NORA: MY DEAREST, THE TERRIBLE SADNESS WHICH OVERWHELMS ME EACH TIME WE SAY FAREWELL CAN ONLY BE DRIVEN AWAY IF I KEEP YOUR FACE, MY LOVE, CLEAR IN MY MIND'’S EYE. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS WITH ME AS I MOVE HERE AND THERE DURING THE DAY. SURELY NONE COULD SURMISE AS I WALK IN THE STREET, OR WORK AMONG THOSE FOR WHOM I CARE SO LITTLE, BUT IT IS YOUR MEMORY LOCKED IN MY HEART, AND YOUR VOICE THAT I HEAR CALLING MY NAME OVER AND OVER. SOMETIMES, I WEPT WITH EYES CLOUDED WITH TEARS. "REALIZING AT LAST THAT YOU ARE NOT WITH ME. I MUST END HERE SINCE THIS LETTER BOTH REMINDS-- BOTH REMINDS ME HOW DISTANT YOU ARE AND HOW SAD I WILL BE, UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN. YOUR LOVING GIRL, NORA." SHE MISSES YOU, LOVES YOU, WHAT'’S WRONG WITH THAT? BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT, THE STYLE? THE STYLE? FOR GOD'’S SAKE, JOYCE. SHE COPIED IT FROM A BOOK. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? BECAUSE I KNOW THE GIRL WE'’RE DEALING WITH. YOU'’RE AN AWFUL BOLLOCKS, COSGRAVE, DO YOU KNOW THAT? WOMAN: SAW OUR MOTHER ASHAMED. THE NATIONS SAW OUR HEAD BENT LOW, NOR KNEW THAT IN OUR HEARTS, UNTAMED FIRE STILL UNQUENCHABLE GOOD GLOW. MR. JOYCE, YOU'’RE NEXT. UH, RUSSELL, CAN I ASK YOU WHY I HAVEN'’T BEEN PAID FOR THE STORIES I SENT YOU? ACTUALLY, UM, SOMETHING WERE QUITE GOOD, I THOUGHT, BUT FRANKLY, THERE HAD BEEN SOME COMPLAINTS. NOT SUITABLE MATERIAL FOR THE IRISH HOMESTEAD. WE WON'’T BE PUBLISHING ANYMORE. BUT IT WAS YOU WHO APPROACHED ME. PLEASE, MR. JOYCE, THIS IS ALL PREPARED. COME ON NOW, BEFORE THINGS GET ANY WORSE.

JIM, FOR JESSIE'’S SAKE! I COULD SEE IT FROM HERE. I WAS WATCHING THE WAY YOU ARE WITH HIM. BUT YOU ASKED COSGRAVE TO ESCORT ME HERE. YOU SAID IT WOULDN'’T BE RIGHT FOR ME TO BE ALL ALONE. YOU SEE, I FORGOT HOW QUICKLY YOU GET TO KNOW A STRANGE MAN. OF COURSE, I TALK TO STRANGERS. I WORK IN A HOTEL. JIM, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN YOU CAME UP TO ME? GO OR NO? YOU MIGHT BE A STRANGER. YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO NO ONE, BUT YOURSELF. YOU HAVE YOUR FRIENDS, YOU CAN GO OUT WITH THEM. SOME OF MY FRIENDS TELL ME YOU COPIED THAT LETTER OUT OF A BOOK, THAT THERE'’S NOTHING SINCERE IN IT AT ALL. YOU SHOWED THEM? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] YOU SHOWED THEM MY LETTER. YOU HEAR THAT, HUH? THEY LOVE ME. THEY CAN'’T GET ENOUGH OF ME. I LAID MYSELF BARE BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU UNDERSTOOD, AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU ALSO-- BUT NOW I CAN SEE YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHO I AM, AND YOU THINK YOU CAN INSULT ME WITH SOME PETTY WORDS STOLEN FROM A WOMAN'’S PENNY NOVEL! NO, I DON'’T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. I WROTE WHAT I FEEL. I LOVE YOU. I CAN'’T HELP IT IF I CAN'T SAY IT DIFFERENT TO OTHER PEOPLE. EVEN WRITERS HAVE TO USE THE SAME WORDS AS OTHER PEOPLE. LEAVE ME ALONE! STANI, WHO'’S THAT TALKING TO JIM? SHE'’S A MAID AT JIMM'S HOTEL. I AM SICK OF IT ALL. THAT'’S WHY I THOUGHT THAT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US IS AT LEAST SOMETHING LIKE LOVE. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOU DESPISE ME. -I DON'’T DESPISE YOU. -BUT FOR YOU, IT'’S JUST ANOTHER FELLOW LIKE ANY OTHER. AND IF IT MADE ME HAPPY FOR YOU TO PULL ME OFF, THEN FAIR ENOUGH. BUT THAT WASN'’T TO GET CLOSE TO YOU NOW. THAT WAS RIGHT OUT. AND THAT'’S IT ALL OVER, ISN'’T IT? THUS THIS COUNTRY. THERE'’S NOTHING NATURAL ABOUT IT. NOTHING FREE AND OPEN PEOPLE, PARALYZED BY FEAR, FRIGHTENED OF THEMSELVES, FRIGHTENED OF THE CHURCH, THAT'’S WHY YOU WON'T LET ME INSIDE YOU, I CAN SEE THAT NOW. BUT I THOUGHT THAT NIGHT, THAT NIGHT WHEN YOU TOOK A HOLD AND THEN YOU LAUGHED, I THOUGHT, JESUS, WE CAN'’T BE NATURAL TOGETHER. WE DIDN'’T GROW OLD AND DIE WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHED EACH OTHER TO THE HEART. JIM, STOP ALL THIS. THIS ISN'’T YOU. OH, REALLY? AND WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU SEE ME? -I SEE YOU. -WHO? A NICE, INTELLIGENT, BOOKISH YOUNG MAN WITH A PLEASANT VOICE? SOMEONE YOU CAN MARRY IN A HAPPY SUNDAY EVENING AROUND THE PIANO WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS? DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DO, NORA, ON THE NIGHTS WHEN I'’M NOT WITH YOU? I GO TO WHORES TO CLEANSE MYSELF WITH THE SQUALOR AND PRETENSE THAT PASSES FOR NORMAL LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY. -NO. -YES, THIS THING YOU THINK SO HOLY AND PRECIOUS. ANY NIGHTS, I HAD THEM ONLY I PAY TO FUCK THEM IN A GRIMY BED, STIFF WITH THE SLIME OF THOSE THAT HAD GONE BEFORE ME. -I DON'’T BELIEVE YOU. -WELL, WHY DON'’T YOU? WHY DON'’T YOU BELIEVE ME? BECAUSE WHEN I MET YOU, YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT WOMEN. WHEREAS YOU CLEARLY KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT MEN. MAN: HEY, JOYCE? NEED ANY HELP THERE? IT'’S NEARLY CLOSING TIME, YOU KNOW? HOLD ON! DON'’T YOU SEE? IT'’S ONLY FAIR YOU KNOW WHAT I'’M LIKE AND WHAT I'’M GONNA BE LIKE. ARE YOU COMING OR NOT? DO YOU WANT ME TO WALK YOU BACK? ALL RIGHT. [BULLS MOOING] [BULLS MOOING] ALL RIGHT, GO ON. GET OUT! GO ON! GO ON! WHY ARE YOU SO FRIGHTENED? THEY WOULDN'’T TOUCH YOU. JAMES: I'’M NOT FRIGHTENED. YES, YOU ARE. POOR, SIMPLE-MINDED JIM. I HATE THINGS WITH HORNS. NOW YOU HAVE HORNS. [CHUCKLES] TOUCH ME, I'’M LONELY HERE. -WHAT'’S THE MATTER, JIM? -MY MOTHER. AFTER SHE DIED, SHE APPEARED TO ME LIKE THAT, AND SO MANY PEOPLE OUT TO GET US. IF I STAY HERE, THEY'’LL KILL ME. JIM. TAKE ME WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO. THERE'’S NOTHING FOR ME IN DUBLIN WITHOUT YOU, JIM. I THINK YOU'’RE MAD TO GO WITH HIM, DO YOU KNOW THAT? I KNOW. I'’M MAD TO GO WITH HIM. WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU DON'’T FIT? IT'’S AN AWFUL FOREIGN PLACE WHERE YOU CAN'’T TALK THE LANGUAGE, AND YOU HAVE NO MONEY, WHERE IT'’S FREEZING COLD. CAN I BORROW YOUR COAT? STANI. STANI. NOW WE'’RE GOOD AND ALL. AS LONG AS IT'’S ENOUGH TO GET US OUT OF HERE. YATES, HE GAVE A FEW SHIRTS. SKEFFINGTON GAVE NOTHING. SAID YOU DIDN'’T PAY HIM BACK THE LAST TIME. -BASTARD. -I GOT THE BOOTS ON. JESUS. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WILL TAKE SO LONG TO GET IN HERE, WOULD YOU? I KEEP THINKING WE SHOULD BE THERE BY NOW. I WILL GIVE ANYTHING TO MY FRIENDS WHEN THEY FIND OUT I'’M GONE. NORA, YOU DON'’T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'’VE DONE, DO YOU? YOU'’RE NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY AT ALL. BUT THIS IS MY SECOND TIME RUNNING AWAY. I'’M NOT ON MY OWN THIS TIME. I AM SO TIRED. CAN WE GET SOMETHING TO EAT? THE PENNIES WE'’LL GET IN ADVANCE FROM THE BERLITZ. LOOK, JUST LET ME FIND THE SCHOOL, GET US A ROOM AND THEN WE CAN EAT AND SLEEP. I DON'’T MIND CARRYING THE LUGGAGE. I'’LL CARRY IT MYSELF. I JUST DON'’T WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE, PLEASE? NORA. THE BERLITZ PEOPLE, THEY DON'’T KNOW I'’M WITH SOMEONE. THEY THINK I'’M ALONE, YOU KNOW, SINGLE. IT'’LL BE SIMPLER THAT WAY TO GET A JOB, I MEAN. IT'’LL ONLY BE AN HOUR. YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE, I DON'’T CARE. NORA, IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO BE SURE OF GETTING THE JOB. OH, SUIT YOURSELF. SIGNORINA! [SPEAKS ITALIAN] SIGNORINA. [MAN SPEAKS ITALIAN] NORA? NORA! NORA? OH, THERE YOU ARE, HIDING. YOU'’LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. I DON'’T GIVE A TINKER'S CURSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. I GOT CAUGHT IN A FIGHT. WELL, YOU WEREN'’T LEFT LIKE A UNCLAIMED PARCEL THOUGH, WERE YOU? LEFT FOR ANYONE TO POKE AT AND JEERED? -NO, I'’M SORRY, BUT HONESTLY-- -DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I SAT HERE TODAY AND I REALIZED THAT I NEED YOU FOR EVERYTHING. -I NEED YOU FOR EVERYTHING, TOO. -NO. EVERY SINGLE THING THAT GOES INTO MY MOUTH COMES FROM YOU WHERE I DON'’T EAT. EVERYTHING I WANT TO SAY GOES THROUGH YOU WHERE I DON'’T SPEAK. NORA, YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOU. NOTHING BUT TRAINS AND PARKS AND WAITING AND HIDING. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING AWAY AS WE'’RE CLEAR OF ALL THAT, TO BE FREE, YOU SAID? BUT ALL IT IS IS ONE HOLE AFTER ANOTHER. AND WHAT'’S NEXT, JIM? WHAT'’S THE NEXT LITTLE THING YOU HAVEN'’T TOLD ME ABOUT? NOTHING, WE'’RE HERE. WE'’VE ARRIVED. NO, I WANT TO GO HOME. NORA, IT'’S BEAUTIFUL, WAIT AND SEE. NO, I'’VE HAD ENOUGH, JIM. I JUST WANT TO GO HOME. WELL, WHICH ONE? THE ONE IN FINN'’S HOTEL OR THE ONE IN GALWAY? COME ON. FUCK UP. FUCK UP, LOVE. [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] I LIKE THEM ALL. EACH STORY IS SO LITTLE AND YET EVERY MOMENT STAYS. I FEEL I'’VE BEEN FOR A LONG HOLIDAY IN DUBLIN. NO, NOT A HOLIDAY. -A NIGHTMARE, PERHAPS? -NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR LOVE BUT YOU TRY HARD. YES, WHAT IS IT? MY FAVORITE, THIS ONE. -ARABY? -YES, OF COURSE. THE BOY IS SO IN NEED, HE WANTS TO BUY THIS GIRL, MANGAN'’S SISTER, SOMETHING EXOTIC AT THE BAZAAR, SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY, SO HE WILL DESERVE HER. HE IS SO HUNGRY FOR HER, BEAUTIFUL. BUT YOU KNOW, JOYCE, SOMETIMES YOU-YOU PAUSE A LITTLE. OH, I PAUSE A LOT, BUT NEVER IN MY WORK. REALLY? SO TELL ME, WHY MUST THE BOY FAIL? HE REACHES ARABY TOO LATE. IT IS DARK AND DREARY. THE HERO WEEPS BITTER TEARS AND CURSES WHAT YOU CALL AS VANITY. REALITY. YES, BUT YOU KNOW, IN LIFE, IT'’S NOT ALWAYS SO TRAGIC. SOMETIMES, LOVE CAN DISCOVER A TREASURE AS STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL AS THIS BOY WANTS TO FIND IN ARABY, AND IT'’S REAL. NORA. WOULDN'’T YOU SAY SHE IS REAL?

YOU DIDN'’T END UP WITH ME, NORA. COMPLETE FREEDOM TO COME AND GO AS YOU PLEASE. FREEDOM? TO DO WHAT? TO GO WHERE? I'’VE GIVEN MORE TO YOU MORE THAN I EVER HAVE TO ANYONE. -DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT? -ARE YOU JOKING ME? IF YOU'’RE NOT OUT GETTING DRUNK, YOU'’RE SITTING THERE WRITING, AND IF I JUST TO DROP DEAD ON THE FLOOR IN FRONT, YOU WOULDN'’T EVEN NOTICE.

I HAVE BEEN THINKING, JOYCE, WOULD YOU LIKE TO WRITE THE OPERA REVIEW FOR MY NEWSPAPER? MOST CERTAINLY. WILL I BE PAID? OF COURSE, BUT ONLY TICKETS. [CHUCKLES] SIGNOR JOYCE.

HAVE YOU ANYTHING LEFT WITH THE MONEY I SENT YOU? NO, HARDLY ANY. WELL, YOU TOLD ME TO BUY THE SUIT FOR THE BERLITZ, AND THEN THINGS ARE SO TIGHT AT HOME, I HAD TO LEAVE SOME MONEY FOR THE GIRLS AND THEN THERE WAS A MATTER OF SOME FOOD ON THE JOURNEY. I HAD TWO EGGS AND COFFEE. REALLY, I HAVE 40 CROWNS, JIM. FINE BROTHER YOU HAVE! -WELCOME TO TRIESTE, STANI. -IS SHE ALL RIGHT? WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, I DIDN'’T LEAVE HER IN THE STREETS LIKE I SAID I WOULD. [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] LOOK, JIM, WE'’RE HERE SO SHUT UP. DO I HAVE TO ROLL? NORA, GIORGIO-- GIORGIO I.

HELLO, NORA! DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING, STANI? THAT NORA THERE, SHE CAN'’T SPELL OR PUNCTUATE OR EVEN USE A CAPITAL LETTER, BUT SHE CAN PRODUCE CHILDREN, ISN'’T THAT AMAZING? YOU'’RE AMAZING, NORA! SEE, I NOTICE THESE THINGS NO ONE ELSE WOULD. [COOING] BEEN A LONG TIME WAITING FOR HIS FATHER TO FEED HIM. [BABY COOING] YOUR LUNCH IS THERE FOR YOU ON THE STOVE. WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING NOW IF YOU WEREN'’T SAVING YOUR BROTHER FROM DRINKING? JIM'’S A GENIUS, BUT HE IS DIFFERENT TO WHO I AM, SO I WOULD SEE IT AS MY JOB TO EASE CERTAIN OBSTACLES SO THAT WORK CAN BE DONE. HOW MUCH DO YOU BELIEVE? IT'’LL BE A TERRIBLE SHAME, NORA, IF JIM WERE NOT TO BECOME EVERYTHING HE WERE MEANT TO BECOME. I SEE. OH, POOR STANI. ALL THE WAY TO TRIESTE TO ESCAPE AND NOW YOU'’RE THE PRISONER OF TWO FAMILIES INSTEAD OF ONE. ALL YOU NEED NOW IS TO GET MARRIED YOURSELF. ALL RIGHT, JIM. ALL RIGHT, LET'’S GO HOME. -TRICK? -FOR CHRIST'’S SAKE, JIM, YOU'’RE HALF-BLIND FROM THAT SHITE ALREADY, WOULD YOU NOT THINK OF THE WORK? OH, GOD FORBID, I SHOULD GO BLIND BEFORE I PAY YOU BACK. WILL NOT COME OUT -UNLESS I PAY FOR IT. -WHY? THEY SAID THE DUBLINERS IS A BOOK ABOUT IRELAND, AND BOOKS ABOUT IRELAND DO NOT SELL. THERE'’S ONLY ONE WAY OUT OF THIS MESS. YOU'’LL HAVE TO GO TO IRELAND AND THEN SEE THE PUBLISHER. WHAT? YOU TAKE GIORGIO TO SEE HIS GRANDFATHER. I CAN'’T GO BACK. I CAN'’T GO BACK. I WON'’T GET BACK HERE.

IT REMIND OF SOMEONE I KNEW. JIM: WHO? YOUNG FELLOW IN GALWAY. SOMEONE YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH. YEAH, I SUPPOSE I WAS, YEAH. WE WERE ONLY YOUNG, I... I USED TO SNEAK OUT AT NIGHT TO MEET HIM. WE HAD TO HIDE FROM MY UNCLE, YOU SEE. AND THE TIME, THEY WERE SENDING ME TO THE CONVENT, HE STOOD OUTSIDE, BEGGING FOR ME TO COME DOWN, BUT I COULDN'’T. AND THEN HE DIED, NO ONE TOLD ME UNTIL AFTER THE FUNERAL, BECAUSE IT WAS THAT NIGHT HE TOOK BED. SO HE DIED FOR THE LOVE OF YOU? YEAH, HE DID. WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME? ALL THOSE STORIES OF GALWAY, YOU NEVER SAID A WORD. NO, THEY SEEM SO FAR AWAY. BUT SEEING THAT FELLOW, IT REMINDED ME. AS WELL, AS WELL-- I SHOULD GO, SEE IF GIORGIO IS ALL RIGHT. -I'’LL COME WITH YOU. -NO, PLEASE DON'’T. SEE YOU LATER. THERE WE GO. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? -SEE YOU LATER, STANI. -YEAH, SEE YOU LATER. JIM: WHERE ARE YOU GOING, FUNNY LAD? YOU'’LL FALL OFF THE BED. YOU'’LL FALL OFF THE BED. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? HMM? JIM, NORA. I'’M GOING TO MOVE OUT AND SO YOU CAN HAVE THIS PLACE TO YOURSELVES AGAIN. DON'’T BE SILLY, STANI. NO, I HAVE MY MIND MADE UP AND... IT'’S NOT WORKING OUT, WITH ALL OF US IN TOP OF EACH OTHER LIKE THIS. SO LET'’S TALK ABOUT IT LATER, ALL RIGHT? I JUST WANTED TO INFORM YOU OF MY DECISION. GIORGIO, WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE PAPERS? [GIORGIO COOS] OH, GIORGIO, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? -[COOS] -HE'’LL GO MAD. [COOS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] IS THAT ANOTHER NEW HAT? I HAVEN'’T PAID FOR THE LAST ONE YET. THEY SAY THAT LIVING WELL IS THE BEST REVENGE. THAT MUST BE HALF A MONTH'’S SALARY HERE, AT LEAST. WELL, THERE'’S A LOT MORE THAN THAT, JIM. WELL, WE'’RE STAYING HERE TONIGHT AS WELL. THE LANDLADY WON'’T LET US BACK UNTIL WE PAY THE RENT. AH, NOW THERE'’S A COINCIDENCE. I JUST GAVE MY NOTICE IN THE SCHOOL TODAY. IF STANI WILL ADVANCE US SOME CASH, IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT. NORA: IS IT MY TURN AGAIN FOR A BAD NEWS? YOU MEAN THERE'’S MORE? WELL, I THINK SO. JIM: JESUS. NORA: GIORGIO GOT HOLD OF THOSE TODAY. BUT THEY'’RE ALL HERE. WHAT IS HE DOING? I'’LL KILL HIM. THEY'’RE TORN, THAT'S ALL. -READ IT, JIM. -WHAT? THAT NEW STORY. YOU CALL IT, "THE DEAD". I READ IT. DID YOU THINK IT WAS GOOD? NORA: HELLO, STRANGER. STANI: HELLO, NORA. IS THIS LUCIA? COME UP.

READ OUT THE PART WHERE HE ASKS IS GIORGIO REALLY HIS SON. READ OUT WHERE HE ASKS WHO ELSE FUCKED ME BEFORE HE DID. "DID YOU SLIDE YOUR HAND INSIDE HIS TROUSERS AS YOU DID WITH ME? DID YOU WALK ALONG THE RIVER, OR GO DOWN THERE DAILY TO KISS--" -NO, YOU HEARD IT FROM HIS OWN MOUTH! -STOP! PEOPLE IN DUBLIN ARE LAUGHING AT HIM FOR TAKING ON THE GIRL THAT MANY MEN HAVE ENJOYED. NICE, NICE NOTE. BUT YOUR BROTHER, THE GREAT WRITER. ALL I EVER KNOW, I KNOW IS HE'’S GONE MAD, MAD. IT'’S COSGRAVE. AND THAT SHOWER OF POISONOUS BASTARDS. WELL, HE'’S BACK WHERE HE BELONGS. IN THE LAND OF THE BETRAYERS. NOW YOU'’RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO WRITE TO HIM, TELL HIM IT'’S NOT--IT'S NOT TRUE, RIGHT? HMM? NOW, JESUS, NORA, LISTEN TO ME HERE. YOU KNOW JIM. YOU KNOW THAT HE FINDS REJECTION EVERYWHERE HE GOES. AND WHERE HE CANNOT FIND IT, HE INVENTS IT. SO I KNOW THAT HIS ANGER DOESN'’T HURT YOU. BUT JESUS, NORA, IF YOU DON'’T RESPOND, IF YOU DON'’T DENY IT, NORA. HE BELIEVED COSGRAVE. HE DIDN'’T BELIEVE ME. HELLO, LUCIA, HELLO. WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE? COME, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? -WHERE'’S MOMMY? -[THUDS] WHERE'’S YOUR MOMMY? WHERE'’S YOUR MOM? SHE'’S IN HERE? SHE'’S IN HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'’M CLEANING THE ROOM. AND YOU'’RE NOT WELL. NO, I WANT IT TO STAY EXACTLY AS IT IS! [SIGHS] GO AWAY, STANI. STANI: YOU JUST GONNA HAVE TO WRITE TO HIM, NORA. GO AWAY! MAN: DO YOU REMEMBER YEARS AGO, I ASKED YOU, "DID YOU LOVE HER?" AND YOU SAID... "YOURS WAS THE MIND THROUGH WHICH SHE MUST THINK, AND YOURS WAS THE BODY THROUGH WHICH SHE MUST FEEL." SHE WAS SO EASY THAT FIRST TIME, I SHOULD'’VE KNOWN. JIM, NORA GAVE UP EVERYTHING SHE KNEW AND WENT HALFWAY ACROSS EUROPE TO BE WITH YOU. IT WAS THE BEST THING YOU EVER DID. -HOW DO YOU MEAN? -WHAT? YOU GOT AWAY FROM DUBLIN. YOU FOUND LOVE WITHOUT ASKING THEIR PERMISSION. WELL, JESUS, DON'’T YOU REMEMBER HOW COSGRAVE AND GOGARTY TRIED TO UNDERMINE YOU? HOW THEY LIED ABOUT NORA JUST TO KEEP YOU EXACTLY WHERE THEY WANTED YOU. JIM: EXCUSE ME? YES, SIR? DO YOU LIVE IN THE ATTIC ROOM? I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR? MY WIFE USED TO BE A MAID HERE. I WONDER IF I COULD HAVE A LOOK AT WHERE SHE SLEPT. IS YOUR WIFE DEAD, SIR? WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY? WOMAN: I'’LL HAVE TO GO DOWN NOW, SIR. YOU JUST LET YOURSELF OUT WHENEVER YOU'’RE READY. STANI: THAT'’S ANOTHER LETTER FROM JIM. I DON'’T WANT TO READ ANYMORE OF HIS SHITE. YOU OPEN IT. I DON'’T WANT TO READ IT, NORA. THAT CAN'’T BE WORSE THAN WHAT YOU'’VE SEEN ALREADY.

[SPEAKS ITALIAN] NORA: YOU HAVEN'’T WRITTEN FOR DAYS, JIM. IS IT BECAUSE I WAS SILENT BEFORE TO PUNISH ME? GOD KNOWS WHO YOU'’LL GO WITH IN DUBLIN TO STATE YOU'’RE IN. YOU SEND ME COCOA AND ASK ME HAVE YOU BEEN CRUEL TO ME? YOU KNOW YOU HAVE, JIM, SO CRUEL THAT I HAVE WEPT AND WEPT AND LAY IN OUR BED NOT KNOWING WHAT I WILL DO. JIM: ALL I THINK OF IS YOU, MY DARLING. NORA, THERE IS A LETTER I WANT TO WRITE, OR MAYBE WANT YOU TO WRITE, BUT I DARE NOT ASK. I WANT TO COME TO YOU NOW, TO FIND YOU ASLEEP TO BREATHE IN YOUR SMELL. TO SAY ALL THOSE WORDS YOU SAY WERE MERE LONG. WRITE THOSE WORDS TO ME, NORA DEAREST. BE SHAMELESS, DISGUSTING, I LONG TO SEE YOU, YOUR EYES BLAZING AT ME WHEN WE'’RE ALONE AGAIN. NORA: OH, JIM, I AM WEARING NO UNDERCLOTHES TODAY. I FOUND A PAIR WITH A STAIN. I WANTED TO SEND THEM TO YOU BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD EXCITEYOU. LIKE IT EXCITES YOU WHEN I SAY A CERTAIN WORD YOU WANTED ME TO WRITE OVER AND OVER. DO YOU PULL YOURSELF OFF WHEN I WRITE IT? I WANT TO FUCK YOU SO BADLY. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT WE DID IT ALL NIGHT BACKWARDS, WHEN YOU FUCKED ME ALL NIGHT LONG? [NORA MOANING] JIM: I WANT YOU TO PUNISH ME AGAIN AND AGAIN.
