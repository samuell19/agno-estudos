I dream of you my brother, and in my dreams I talk to you. In my dreams I see you, not here but in other places, not in this tomb where I buried you. You died a long time ago. You loved me, my brother. I’d like to be buried next to you. In my dream, we were walking together through the jungle. We were hunting animals with a blowpipe. I too will join you, my brother. But no one will come and see me when I’m dead. A small bottle of liquor. Breathe deeply through your mouth, as if you were breathless. As if you were in the jungle. Yes, like this. I have a lot of pus in my eye, miss. - You have pus in your eyes in the morning? - Yes. - It stings too? - Yes. It feels like sand or dust, does it? When I look at people, it seems I see fireflies. Small fireflies, here and there. I can’t see very well. Anything else Amadeo? At night I have backache, miss. And I have pains in my hips. It hurts when you walk or while sitting? Both. You have small sores here, Amadeo. On these toes. - It doesn’t hurt when I touch? - No, miss. - Nowhere? - No. - Are they stiff in the morning or in the evening? - No. - You always walk with boots or…? - With boots. - No other shoes? - No. And what about this sore? - I fell. - From high up? - No, I just slipped. - You slipped? - And nobody helped you? - No, miss. You spend a lot of time alone in the jungle. You must come here more often. - This little toe hurts. - This one? No, the last one. - It hurts if I move it up? - No. - And if I move it down? - No. - Only when I press? - Yes. Will you come to the Medical Center more often to be looked after? - Will you? - Yes. Will you go less into the jungle? Yes, miss. You must stay here, in Intuto. If anything happens to you in the jungle, who will help you? There’s no one to help you in the jungle. Ok Amadeo? Same when you go fishing, you mustn’t go alone. At you age you must have company. You must stay in town more. You agree Amadeo? And every time you’re in pain, come to the Medical Center for a check up. Agreed? Yes, miss. Animals, I’m talking to you, those who live high up in the trees. To the Choro monkey who moves around the treetops. And to the Backisapa monkey, who also lives high up in these trees. I’m going to hunt a monkey with a blowpipe to feed myself. Like the ones I used to eat, with my brother, when we lived in the jungle. Let’s have another drink. Ok, go on. There weren’t any dogs. In my grandparents’ days, we had birds, monkeys, peccarys, tapirs. Everything but jaguars. In those days jaguars would eat people. One of my brothers was eaten alive by a jaguar, while sleeping in the jungle. The jaguar ate him. All that’s over now. There are a few left, but now they're far away. Amadeo, were the oil companies over there? The workers went… as far as my father’s hunting ground. Just below Trompeteros. You see? Towards Bolonesi. Did the pipeline go through there? Yes, it did. Near Huangana, my brother. No, it went through… Through the village of Bolonesi. So it must have gone through the Ahuaruna? No, it didn’t. The pipeline went through the hills of the Ahuaruna, across the Aucayacu, as far as Bolonesi. And it ended towards Pucacuro. They don’t drink water from the river anymore. They get the water… The water that drops on the treetop leaves. That’s how the animals drink. And in the summer? There’s always water there. - The river has become black. - They can’t drink contaminated water. But there’s enough water up there? Of course! It accumulates in hollow trunks. The monkeys up there drink it. So do the birds, and the tamarins. Even the monkeys. Even the Choro monkeys. All these animals drink that water. The tamarin is too lazy, he doesn’t climb up! You’re right! He drinks the dirty water from the river. That’s what I’m saying, my brother. The other day the nurse said to me: "Don’t go into the jungle anymore!" What’s to become of me if I don't? You love the jungle Amadeo! Do you think somebody would feed me then? You know Amadeo, I couln’t find you the other day. I asked Esteban and Vaquita where you were. They told me you were in Sanango. Three days later, you weren’t back! I thought something had happened to you. And you almost got bitten by a snake! To set traps in the river, I have to stand in the water. But my friend, you almost got bitten! - Which snake was it? - The Jergón. What happened? It swam next to me while I was checking a trap. I had a stick… There was the snake, swimming in the water. I hit it and killed it. - Was it about to bite you? - Yes of course. For God’s sake Amadeo! You must take better care. I won’t have a coffin either. I don’t want one. You know, everything is changing here. There are very few animals left in the jungle. One of the tall trees has been cut down. It was the Lupuna. Men did it with axes. The men who did this are those who live on the other side of the river. The forest wouldn’t be ruined if we the Taushiros had survived. When you died, I was left alone. Now, I’m the last one. Yes, my daughter. All right. Yes, but when…? When will you come and see me? Ah, yes… Yes my little girl, ok. Me too, my daughter. Ah, all right. Yes, I understand. Yes my daughter, all right. - Have you put the cream on your feet? - Not yet. No? Why not? Why don’t you want to do it? Is it cured? I doubt it. Have you run out? No, I have a little left. - But you don’t want to use it? - I’ll put some on tomorrow. Don’t move your hand for a moment. Amadeo, I’m going to examine your ears, ok? Amadeo, why do your children live in another country? Why don’t they live with you? - I don’t know, miss. - Why do they live over there? They were adopted there. Amadeo, that’s what we’ll do. Hold your nose and push, ok? Go on Amadeo, push. Wait for me. And again. Do you spend a lot of time by the river? Do you put your head in the water? - Do you? - Yes. Has your hearing got worse since? Yes. - Same with your eyesight? - Yes, miss. Can you hear when I do this? No. - I can now. - Good. Ok Amadeo. - It hurts when I do this? - No. It aches here. When I press here? - Nothing. - It doesn’t ache? And when I do this? That’s where it’s sore. All right. I am with you, my brother. I think of you. I don’t know if I can leave Intuto. Should I go and live with my children in Puerto Rico? I don’t think I can live anywhere but in the jungle. I think of you, my brother. When I’m dead, we’ll be together. When I’m dead, we’ll be together.
