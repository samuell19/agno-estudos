- [Woman] What are your sexual fantasies? - [Man] I have this one fantasy about my penis getting really, really big, real big, it's like as tall as me and these angels are hovering over it and their wings are beating really fast and you can feel the air on my big penis, man. When I explode, it's like snowing or something, it's just raining down all over these people. Everybody's licking their Iips and shit. (Iaughs) And really smiling a lot and stuff. How does orgasm make me feel? Makes me feel, makes me feel like god, man. When I come, no not like god, more like, more like Elvis Presley or something. - [Robotic Woman's Voice] The female is sociocentric. The male is egocentric. But we have found that men can be adjusted, improved permanently and we can alter the gene pool in such a way that only convivial men will be born. Gender is a learned thing. First we need to understand the male sexual identity. We need to know which parts are intrinsic and which are conditioned and we need to know what parts are essential so that the rest may be scraped away and excised. In the first phase of our program, the subject was deprived of sleep and kept on a high carbohydrate diet. This made him more susceptible to mental conditioning. He was fed large amounts of white sugar and kept isolated in a contained observation space, deprived of human contact. We have found that a combined water and darkness context with a 15 per second low intensity flicker is effective in producing great tension and irritability. We use this as an interim conditioning tool. Later, other reinforcement and inversion techniques became applicable. When Billy Hampton first came to us, he was an aggressive heterosexual adolescent male. We encouraged his sexual fantasies. We fed him aphrodisiacs and psycho cholic stimulants. We made him adore his body, love his manhood, then we took it away. First, we found it important to simulate a homosexual experience. We facilitated the change through electroshock aversion and a carefully prescribed regimen of selected films. We learned we could control his arousal and preferences. Then we began to phase out his attraction to women. Eventually he was made to feel only guilt and revulsion toward his sexual organ. He was given medical doses of progesterone, a female hormone along with silicon inserts for female breast construction. He was then surgically castrated and restructured with working female parts. Several months of personality tests were given before the gender manipulation was reversed, complete with penis grafting into the original male mode. This process was performed successfully two complete times within the last year. We're now extremely interested to observe what his sexual preferences will be during his visit to Brendovery. Besides gender research-- - Who sent him to us? - [Robotic Woman's Voice] Experimented with the personalities-- - He answered the advert in the Siren. - Electroshock, hydro shock, spinal taps, nausea aversion? This research you are doing is costing us a good deal of money. - Look, we're not just hitting babies with a hammer to see what happens and we do not exist solely for your political posturings. - [Robotic Woman's Voice] Is given to the subject. - [Woman] Billy, this is the same test we gave you once before. We'd like to see if any of your attitudes have changed. So answer as honestly as possible. Do you have any feeling of resentment against the world? - [Billy] I don't resent the world as much as I resent buildings and things. - [Woman] Do you often feel alone even when you are with your closest friends? - [Billy] I like to be alone more than with other people. I can get along with people if I have to. - [Woman] Are you frequently depressed? - [Billy] Only when I can't have my way. - [Woman] Do you sometimes feel that life is not worth living? - [Billy] Only when I don't have any dope. - [Woman] Do you think you have received your fair share in life? - [Billy] Yeah, I feel like I'm getting a pretty fair shake. - [Woman] Are you usually confident of your looks and abilities? - [Billy] Sure, I'm real comfortable with myself. I'm pretty cool, you know? - [Woman] Do you think people usually like you the first time they meet you? - [Billy] Fuck em, I don't give a shit if they like me or not. - [Woman] Do you think that you are important or at least useful in this world? - [Billy] I feel like I am easily used. I feel like I'm used by the world. I don't feel like I'm useful. Yeah, I'm useful in the world, an easy tool. I remember my principal one time, he said to me, he said, Billy, we just can't use you around here. And I looked at that son-of-a-bitch and I said, right, man, that's fuckin' right, you ain't gonna use me either. - [Woman] Do you think that this world is a nice place to live? - [Billy] (Iaughs) Well I guess I'm supposed to say yes. Sure, it's a great place if you're not in America. - I've been through all the information, but Whitfred is the prostitution magistrate at Brendovery, Wales. Looks like a sweet old man, doesn't he? Late last year, he organized an illicit slavery operation to boost his town's economy. Many of the farmers in the area are involved sending their daughters away to the Mid East and Africa. There is, however, a dearth of good young men available, so Whitfred has concentrated on kidnapping American ex-patriots. I found in his file one peculiar thing, he delights in telling exotic stories about his days in India. One story is about a tribe of natives who he found living at the top of a mountain. They won't come down because they're afraid of the tigers that inhabit the valley. Maybe we could find some sort of aggression stimulus in that. - [Robotic Woman's Voice] Later, we accomplished personality reconstruction through means of electronarcosis. This involves 24 shock treatments over a span of four days. Next he is given Phenobarbital under hypnosis and made to sleep for several days without dreaming. This process returns the subject to a childlike state where the personality is more pliable and responsive to modification. During the sleep period, the patient must be carefully monitored and turned and massaged each day to prevent physical impairment. Each experiment was followed immediately by a memory blotting session using a combination of electroshock, LSD and hypnosis. It is important to us that the patient have no memory of pain what-so-ever. During the periods in between experiments, he was kept happy and secure. There have been a small number of complaints about bad dreams which could conceivably be some sort of subconscious outgrowth of the aversion therapy, but even so, this is not without precedent. Our earlier test subjects met with similar occurrences. Our last phase of preparatory work with Billy was a program of heavy drug testing. We provided him with an assortment of psychotropic and psycho cholic compounds which he was encouraged to take at his leisure. LSD, DMT and LSE were administered to him at regular intervals. We reserved the antidote, Ergotamine, in the event he became overextended. This lack of psychic risk influenced him towards larger and larger doses of hallucinogens. He has found these experiments extremely pleasurable. - There are not many precedents for what we are doing. By the very nature of this project, we are forced to invent our own rules. - I understood from the beginning, we would not be goal oriented. It's a think tank. We generate ideas. Others can use our findings for warfare or whatever. - Our purpose right now is to kill Major Guthry Whitfred. - A petty bureaucrat. We're spending thousands of pounds to kill one old man who will die on his own within a year. - Yes, but what you fail to realize-- - Look, if you just want someone to get your major dead for you, then hire some bitch off the street to gun him down. - You are too obsessed with the beauty of your program to render it any practical significance-- - We are established as a group for a single reason, which is to reinstate a long lost balance between the sexes. There are minor malfunctions in the male psychology-- - Yes, we're in agreement certainly, but you confine yourselves to the sterile environment and you lose touch with the world. - [Woman] What can you tell me about your dreams? - [Billy] I'm in like space. I'm hanging on something, but I can only see like my chest and my arms and my head. It feels like it's there, but it feels real numb and then I'm in the water and I hear voices, people's other voices and then I feel kind of like a, something kind of grazed by my leg and it's quick and so weird and the vulnerability of being caught just between two atmospheres 'cause you're on top of the water, you can't jump up into the sky and you can't go underwater and these things just can come at you from any angle. - [Robotic Woman's Voice] Billy Hampton is the third assassin to be trained at this institute. Kevin Brown Muldan was detached to Germany to murder prostitution commissioner, Earnst Caln and Thomas Bear to Switzerland to murder commissioner Claude Tanner. When Billy leaves here, he will have been with us for 730 days and nights, but he will remember it only as one week. He will be visiting in Brendovery under the impression that he is being given a vacation there to enjoy sexual activity. He has been conditioned to react at pre specified times. His sense of time and place may be permanently distorted because of the drugs. - After the murder, it doesn't matter if he is caught. He won't remember how he found it. - Well what will cause Billy to meet Whitfred? - If Billy wants to get a drink in Brendovery, there's two places that can be done, the King's Inn and the Whitehorse. Whitfred owns the Whitehorse and spends most of his time there playing cards. - The major's lookouts will spot him, report his actions to the major. Whitfred's general method is to invite a young man in, then ply him with wine and entertain him with war stories. - Billy has been trained to react with anxiety to the telling of the Tiger Mountain story. When he hears it from Whitfred, he will be thrown into a rage, killing Whitfred with his bare hands. - [Woman] Billy, do you know who Major Whitfred is? He is a tiger keeper. His tigers killed your father. They want to kill you too. Major Whitfred actually is a tiger. He has been sent to Earth by god to kill you. Here's his picture. See the claws and tiger stripes? He wants to kill you like he killed your father, so you must kill him first. - If this experiment is successful-- - If our experiment is successful, Whitfred will die. If not, we as scientists, must analyze our failure, improve upon our methods-- - Until we get the results that we want. - [News Reporter] An outbreak of what appears to be Scarlet Fever, has occurred in the urban centers of the upper eastern U.S. and is now sweeping down along the eastern seaboard into U.S. Proper. Believed to achieve epidemic proportions by midweek, this outbreak appears to be brought on by the garbage and sanitation strikes effective in most urban areas as well as the critical shortages of petrol and synthetic fuels which has crippled overland transportation and interrupted most food shipments into concentrated areas, resulting in numerous incidents of food variety and a reliance on substandard food sources. In addition, as a direct result of the comprehensive prophylactic medicine program enacted by the 1987 National Healthcare Package, massive immunization has caused the collapse of natural immunity systems which has in turn, irrevocably soiled the gene pool. There has been a dramatic increase of chronic epidemics in recent quarters including outbreaks of, among others, Malaria, Typhoid, Diptheria, Syphilis, and Leprosy. Of all the areas inundated by troubled signs of a volatile economy and the ensuing civil strife, perhaps the hardest hit were the five population bound Burroughs of New York City. Due to interruptions of various information sources and the increasingly sporadic output of the international IISP wire, Radio One placed corespondent, Hayes Martin, in the New York Post. - [Man] I'm standing in the 25th ward of Bell Pearl at mid Manhattan, approximately 300 kilometers from the east wall where stationed riflemen of the Common Guard cut off Bell Pearl from neighboring Queens. There is refuse everywhere from the strike standing in heaping mounds and the numerous Ieaking gas and water veins have turned the city into a river of sludge. Most of the subway tunnels and buildings are derelict and the lower tunnels have all been flooded, now serving as the traffic way for the low flat barges that continually run fresh produce. There are few people on the streets-- - I got it! - [Woman] Welcome to the beautiful gardens of Brendovery, the village where your pleasure is our business. We were charted in 1988 under the common market recreational fund as a community devoted to the refinements of sexual pleasure. Only four communities in Britain have been so charted and we were honored because of our thousand year history of prostitution to have been chosen the first one. Now, under the enlightened leadership of commissioner Major Guthry Whitfred, the village legally offers girls and boys in the pique years of allurement in a civilized village atmosphere. Ours is truly a model cottage industry of which the common market can be proud. Enjoy yourselves in safety and health. As part of the common market restructurilization program, we work for you. - [Man] Explosions occur frequently and there is occasional small arms fire off in the distance. On most roof tops, there are vegetable or fruit gardens, able to grow in the free air because of the degree shift brought on by thermo-nuclear effects. Makeshift guide wires and pulleys allow access to derelict buildings whose elevators have been disabled by both the black and the whiteouts. There are numerous post-war refugee camps and tent cities, abandoned vehicles house families. Temporary med centers have been erected to deal with the sickness, but they generally just provide pain killing or nirvana drugs. At night, groups gather around the radioactive slag heaps to keep warm. - Sir, excuse me. - I don't have time for no yanks. - Can you tell me how to-- - Filthy rotters. - Come on, would you be able to gimme directions to the Carecan Auction from here? (dog barking) The auction, I'm Iooking for the auction. - [Old Man] That's a splendid idea. Let me looksy at you. - [Billy] I don't, I forgot the directions. - [Old Man] Well, it may be this way and it may be that way. - [Billy] This way, that way, thank you very much. - [Old Man] Yeah bugger, you rack up your sweet chicks, boyo. (Iaughs) You damn yank, you bastard. (animated conversations) - [Man] Come on, man. - [Man] Look, you want one that I let go at your wound and greasing around inside of you? You like that? All ugly and act vague in two moons? - I have, probably root noise is all. And Leprosy and Jesus down-- - [Man] But do they not have rights? - [Man] Look, I got my fucking rights. Now you listen to me, Ace. Yanks is right in all our problems. They're sucking up our jobs and all a crackle and they'll use up us like they did the bloody U.S., just ship the lot of them back to god sucking America if you ask me. You want Leprosy, what? Well it's your fucking fault for, why not? - Don't be cross, man, I have a reason. - [Man] But weren't they friends in the second war? - [Man] Hey what, like rubbish. (slang trails off) (mumbling) - [Billy] Can you give me some help? - [Bartender] Yeah, what kind of help you need? - [Bartender] I'll take him, may I help you? - [Billy] Yes, I'm a tourist, American. I'm looking for the Carecan Auction or the Castle Hotel. - The Castle Hotel is two blocks down the road. Okay? - [Billy] Thank you. - [Man] Can pop this one over. We're the ones with all the jobs and we got all the crackle and they can hold it up the asses, all I care. - [Man] A postwar reconstruction project to interlace a system of canals across lower Manhattan to be used as alternative routes of commerce was left uncompleted when the church attacked nearby New Jersey and dismantled the program. The unfinished and rusting Iocks are now a home for alligators and fresh water sharks which cruise the Hudson and East Rivers and the inbred Spaniel sized rats on which they feed. There are rumors of tunnel pirates in these parts and a band of armed vet mercenaries who pray on those who stray too close to the river. The city most resembles London, following the battle of Britain, except that there has been no federal money to-- - [Man] You would be Mr. Hampton. One moment, please. - [Man] And the people look a fair sight worse for the experience. - [Man] Your key, sir. That's 29 upstairs. - [Man] Centers on Earth, now a badly scarred, badly burned testament to the worst tendencies of civilization. Hayes Martin, Radio One, in the New York Polis, outer U.S. - [Newscaster] On the economic front, the U.S. depression continues to widen as world economic powers continue to take counter productive measures rendering U.S. policy increasingly impotent. A new barter standard was offered today by the federal control board with the dollar equal to 0.84 grams of bread or roughly 1*2 of an English penny. The new barter rating is promised to last the week. U.S. representatives today walked out of the National Boden Conference in Munich in protest of the conferences refusal to consider the possibility of first world loans. The common market did not participate in those talks. Incidentally, with the interruption of the IISP wire, there is still no word on the Detroit, Toronto riots or the situation in Atlanta. This is Radio One, a British information service operating under the auspices of the common market media. We remind you that it is imperative for any free people to keep abreast of the world's situation. Please stay tuned to Radio One-- - [Woman] Why don't you go talk to him? He seems quite approachable. - [Woman] Yes, I think I will, but in a little bit though. - [Woman] But did you see him? He looked just like Sean Tull. - [Woman] Yes he did. (cheery music playing from the speakers) - [Newscaster] The following items have been added to U.S. ration list for the week of September 11. - [Woman] Sugar, potatoes, soap, aerosol, all perfumes, paint thinner, aluminum foil-- (Ioud menacing music) - Hello. Yes Mr. Shepherd, there's a boy in my room. Well, okay. I'm sure of it, later. You're the American boy, Billy. Is that your name? Do you mind if I rest a minute? You remind me of someone I knew. I'm sure you'd have liked him. - [Woman] Hello, sorry about the inconvenience. I've brought you some wine, compliments of Mr. Shepard. - Thank you. I suppose you're exhausted and I bet you'd like a bath. I'm Mrs. Davis. I hope you don't mind. I believe you have to make an effort in this life, don't you? To be with people. The major doesn't think I should care about those kinds of efforts. An old woman like me, he says. Old woman, I was the best he ever had. Here you go, love. I've given you a little something to make you good with the girls. I've turned six tricks and hour. No matter what, young or old, I'd get them off. They'd be coming before I got going. But I was in love once with John Tom, the boy I loved, John Tom. (Iaughing) (sighs) He was so solemn that when we, when we were lovers, something happened. I went to see the major and he said I shouldn't marry my lover. You're a little quiet, aren't you? You aren't afraid of me. Oh, I'd have a grandson your age if it weren't for the major. Come on, love, we could have some fun. Well, but if you want to go to the auction, you'll have to wait an hour before a runner can take you. We can talk until then. (soft menacing music) - [Boy] My real name is John. It's just that everyone calls me Sally, Sally John. I don't like girls very much, but if you do, I'd recommend Judy Church if she's available. She's the major's favorite. - [Man] Randy, 17, straight sandy hair with a pinched mouth, slender and willing, the smile of a killer who take French, Roman, Greek cultures, firm knowledge of the European scene goes for three ways coppers sandwiches groups, good with animals at 14 and seven. Dallas Ringo, 18, tall and slender, finger on the trigger, she's wet and waiting. Will try anything, straight up, sideways or domino. Also boxed lunches and golden showers. - [Man] All right gents, let's get up (mumbling) Once again, lovers for sale, let's see if we can't-- (people all talking at once) - [Man] Scrotum and nipple piercing, hands of a surgeon. Philata, 19, Persian, dark cupid hair, with a body like a whip, expert tongue, offers hand to mouth, mouth to mouth, helicopter in, oral worship by (multiple people talking over each other) Carl Sampson, 21, seven inch chest, a wall of muscles, good with body work (cross talking). Takes it as it comes, active only. Rosa Lee, 23, (cross talking). Expert at French maiden, gentle nursing, good with (cross talking), specialty is French pastry. All fetishes considered, diapers, toilet slavery. (cross talking) Judy Church, 23, thick black horse mane hair, straight only, clean and discrete-- - [Man] Judy Church, oh you're a lucky one. Just go out past the confectioner's to the railway station and follow the tracks north, the junction with the Shenandoah Line. There right to the riverAfton and cross it by the auto bridge and on to the little cottages on the far bank. Hers is the third one just-- - [Woman] The women of Brendovery are uniformly happy with their positions in the village as hostesses and courtesans as well as mothers and wives. There is always a smile on our faces and a lilt to our voices and we support the liberality of the great common market chart and the freedom it has given us, every one. Our own enlightened village charter tells us the proper attitudes and duties that all citizens must want to exhibit, that which woman were made by nature to do, we do proudly with enthusiasm in Brendovery while hard Iabor and complex tasks are kept for the men of the village. Everyone in Brendovery is grateful to the brilliant men of the role model commission whose ideas are embodied in the very fabric of our village. Brendovery is like a living organism in which each cell adapts to the function for which it is most perfectly suited. We all find ourselves in our ideal roles, the roles to which we were biologically predestined. Yet the freedom that we find within our lives is wonderful. The freedom to move within the anchor of our being as Commissioner Major Guthry Whitfred has so well expressed it. Nature has made women less complex than men, yet able to work far longer with less sleep and for that, we are justly proud. In Brendovery the life of the homemaker is a creative and rewarding challenge. She keeps the house tidy of course and bears her husband's children, but also she participates in a wealth of productive enterprises outside the home. Perhaps she manufactures wooden spools for thread or hand paints lovely calendar pictures or if she is particularly gifted, she may act as one-- - Sit down. - [Woman] For intimate encounters which bring Brendovery such fame and admiration. - [Judy] I'll put some water on the fire. Make yourself at home. - [Woman] Spreading deceit and out and out lies about the common market role model commission and we would be less-- - [Billy] My name's Billy Hampton. - [Woman] There is no question that they comprised the rabble rousers of the Yorkshire women's riots of 1987 and it is they who continue to flog the dead horse of the homemaker's union and it must be said that many of them have profound psychological problems, but in Brendovery, we have long abandoned such selfishness. We recognize that a woman's biology is a woman's freedom. It is our patriotic duty to do our best to make-- - Been a while since I've made love. But I feel so nervous. It's not you. I don't know why I feel this way, but I do. Well I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. - Come on. Oh, you'll do fine. It will be good, yes. You're just sensitive. - [Billy] Mm. - [Judy] That's nice. - [Man] Buddha told a parable in a sutra. A man walking across a field disturbed a tiger. - [Woman] Did you ever have sex with a boy from top to bottom. - [Man] The tiger chasing after him. Soon he came to a precipice where he caught hold of the root of a vine and swung himself over the edge. The tiger growled at him from above. Trembling in fear, the man looked down to where far below, another tiger was casually waiting to eat him. Only the vine sustained him. Two mice, one large and one small, little by little, began to gnaw away at the vine. The man saw a lush of strawberry near him. Clutching the vine with one hand, he plucked the strawberry with the other. How sweet it tasted. (soft distorted music) (soft murmuring) (heavy breathing) (clanking) - [Man] German freeman, Earnst Keln was shot and killed today in the German capital of Berlin as he was leaving parliamentary chambers. Keln was principally known as a prostitution commissioner, running the common market prostitution service in the Lieberstad section of Bon. So far there are no suspects or apparent motives in the killing. This marks the first assassination ever of a common market public official. (quiet menacing music) - [Man] Mafia Mormon warfare continued to rage throughout most of Utah and Nevada today marking the third straight week of such clashes. The IISP wire reports scattered outbursts in both states with the heaviest-- - Mr. Hampton, I spoke with Mrs. Davis. She won't bother you again. - [Man] However the watchtower brigade and several-- - Here's a second key, okay? - [Man] Have landed counter insurgent strikes far into mafia territory and a unified Mormon front appears to be closing in on mafia strongholds of Reno, Tahoe and Valhalla. The president of Kansas, Armando Mercado, was assassinated early Thursday morning when a bomb exploded in his mid ground bunker. Unconfirmed reports are that the apparent coup was the result of power struggles within the Mercado government. Members of both the Spangle society and the Rosicrucian army claim responsibility-- - [Man] An editorial from Radio One, British Information Service, one of the more disturbing stories to come out of this U.S. business is the increasing instances of cannibalism reported in major U.S. metropolitan areas. Unconfirmed news reports tell us that numerous partially devoured carcasses have been found in various coastal cities. Generally those most have nearly ravaged by the war-- (announcement interrupted) - [Woman] Please hurry. (low menacing music) - Atta boy. (water running) (wind blowing) (disjointed audio) (announcements and memories) - [Man] Seems to emerge with the head and trunk are left fairly in tact and the flesh eaten from the limbs and around the genitals and buttocks. In several reports, the entrails have also been removed and eaten. Reports have it that many of the victims have been homosexuals. We find this not only gruesome and sickening, but if true, then particularly indicative of the moral consistency of the U.S. people. One would not be hard pressed to remember a time when the English people faced similar kinds of crisis during the bug bombings in World War II or less obviously, during the weeks of evacuation and shelter scares in the second mega war. (whispering voices) But the English people take these and other challenges with a pride and honor that only centuries of character can provide. Yet oft times, being a poor people, but always one that has known great ages of hardship and sacrifice. Ever since their revolution, the Yanks have armed themselves with the special condescension of benevolence. It is quite easy to see, in retrospect, that such full hearts were contingent exclusively on such poor standards. (soft menacing music) (eerie squawking) (screaming) (distant animated conversation) (knocking) (auctioneer voice in the distance) - [Man] And who is the most beautiful girl in the common market? The matter will be resolved tomorrow night in the Austrian province where 880 lovely misses will show their legs and flash their smiles and flub a few lines on their way to stardom. The winner will receive a week long vacation in Nepal and a kiss from Jason Biddleman, voted tops in the sexy 16 contest last month. And good news from (bell rings) from the Frontier Weekly. Rumors of meat eating villagers in the Spanish Provence have been shown to have been in error. An investigation by police and the SPCA found no evidence of the practice and it is now believed that the particular preparation of eggplant was mistaken-- - Hey man, the bench is free, you know? You might as well sit as stand. Come on over, man. You've really been standing there a long time. I don't think I could stand up that long. I read books all the time. This book's about a phantom man. He's stronger than steel. He can break through walls. Just last night, he tore out the whole back of the Westminster bank in Felnarcly. He smashes people all the time. He can take a chick and wreck her in three seconds. He captured the old man in the tower of Felnarcly just a while ago and he pounded his face and like tore out his nostrils. Fuck he's strong and his skin's shiny black man and smooth like metal. - [Man] Assassination of freeman, Earnst Keln, commissioner of the common market prostitution service of Berlin. - You're strong, huh? I'm pretty strong. I've got a place out by the ocean. Why don't you come up there, huh? - [Man] Sophisticated high beam, electronic heart and brain monitoring devices, surgically implanted in the chest and scalp. - [Boy] Shouldn't stay here much longer. They don't like young fellows in Brendovery. I don't do any harm and they're really out to get me. - [Man] Prostitution commissioners in other parts of the common market have been alerted to the possibility of attacks and guards have been assigned to those who have requested them. - Come on, man. Come on up, you'll like it. Come on. Come on, man. Come on up, you'll like it, come on. Pirates still come, you know? And they bury their treasure just like they used to, but it's hard to find. You have to know exactly what you're looking for. I've got a pirate's knife. It'll cut through steel and it's hundreds of years old and it never gets dull, you know. - [Woman] What's your name? What brings you to this institute? - [Woman's Voice] That's essentially correct, although there is more to it than you just seeing what happens. We'll be giving you written tests, ink blot tests, and a large number of other examinations using many different techniques. Then after you've taken these tests, we'll give you certain drugs and repeat some of these tests in an effort to find out how particular drugs affect you-- - I'm not sure that ever happened to me. - [Woman] You have a question? Please, Billy, feel free at any time to ask any question you want about anything we are doing. If you're nervous, it will interfere with our testing, so please feel free to be completely honest. - I'm tired all the time now. - [Woman] What do you mean? Billy, at any point in the test, you can refuse-- - I can't seem to get enough sleep. I think my brain's fucked up from my dreams or drugs or something. - [Woman] We are a corporation that has absolutely no connection with the government. - I'm not too hungry anymore though. - [Woman] Will be held in strictest confidence. - Maybe they gave me something for that. I just hope they don't kill me in the end. - [Woman] Well if those things happen, of course we'll call your family, but an accident is very unlikely. (soft menacing music) - No sense, man. What are you trying to do, you think I get off on that? - [Woman] As honestly as possible to this Iist of questions. Are you a decent person? - Blood doesn't mean nothing to me. You're no hero, man. Nobody cares what you do. - [Woman] Are you a nobody? Are you popular with men? Are you interested in what other people do? - Actually, I'm pretty sure it's the war. - [Woman] Do you get angry sometimes? Are you a religious person? - You know, maybe it's a religious war. - [Woman] Are you a morally weak person? Are you a hateful person? Are you popular with women? Do you ever think of things too bad to talk about? (soft menacing music) (gulls squawking) (soft menacing music) - [Man] Well, he has to be somewhere, huh? (jumbled voices) Hello. - [Woman] Is he all right? - [Man] Are you all right, boy? - [Woman] Did Tony do this to you? - [Man] He can't even speak. - [Woman] How do you feel about god? Do you believe in god? What does god look like? (church bells ringing) - How in the world did you do this? It just looks terrible. And mom's sitting here looking at you with her heart and all. You young people don't realize how hard it is on old people seeing blood like that. I know what you do at night, cutting yourselves and diddling around. I know what you do and I don't like it, bleeding in front of an old woman, not to mention upsetting Ernie and me and our marriage on a rocky path like it is anyway. It just isn't very thoughtful. If you can't keep from bleeding, at least you could do it in a hospital. All right, come on. You should eat. Come on, you'll feel better if you do. - [Man] He must be hungry after all that bleeding. (church bells ringing) Lads like him ought to have more weight on him, right Love huh? - [Woman] Make yourself at home, Billy. You're welcome to stay here if you like. We'll be in the next room if you need us. (door closes) - [Man] Well I think they're going about the whole business all wrong, yeah? If they come to me, I'll plain write off. - [Woman] Well they didn't and the lord be praised for that. - [Man] He isn't supposed to even wonder, let along have clues. - [Woman] Well of course he wonders. The poor thing doesn't even know who he is. - [Man] The whole idea of trusting something like this to a bunch of farmers is dumb. - [Woman] There you go-- - [Man] What do they know about slavery? - [Woman] You're the one wants-- - [Man] Kevin Brown, indicted murderer-- - [Man] It's daft. If it wasn't daft, it would be working. And if it isn't working, so, it's daft. - How is it? - [Man] The suspect began to lock into fits of extreme feminist rhetoric berating what he called world patriarchy and calling for the elimination of the male species. (doorbell rings) The market god is now speculating that the murder may have been linked to some feminist terrorist organization. - [Man] All right, pay a call. He's here, he's eating. Everything's under control. - [Woman] Is there something not right, John? - [John] You might say that. The major's not at all happy. - [Man] Oh for he's so sick. - [Woman] Ernie. - [Man] We're watching you. - [Woman] There wasn't anything we could do, he just got out of our sight is all-- - [Man] Be more careful. Use Barbara if you need to. Do you have him on the medicine? - [Woman] All that medicine isn't good for him. I don't see why you don't just lock him up. I mean-- - [Man] Oh quit blathering. You'll be next. - [Male Voice In Billy's Head] Attention, young men between the ages of 16 and 25, a private research institute needs you for experimental drug research, minimum pay, room and board supplied, for information ring, 22-22-7822. It would be a nice way to disappear, wouldn't it? - [Man] Look you, at least we're the ones that gives them a family and makes them think someone loves them even if they do get sold away. - The Dutchman is coming at the end of next month. The major wants this one ready for Morocco. He can't have Tony getting a hold of him again and fucking him up-- - [Man] Don't you be telling us what's right or wrong now. - Look old man, don't I know what you've been up to? - [Man] It's true, we've got tenfold more on you and you know it. We're the only ones that cares what happens to them. You vipers would just as soon pack them in the cattle boats off to Tangiers or Botswana or wherever it is they send em. - [Man] The major's got his reasons for everything that he does and he doesn't have to give them to you. Your job is to nurture the boys. Whatever you think you know about cattle boats or Tangiers, you just better forget. - [Man] Puerto Rico, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Rio, Jamaica, Hawaii-- - [Billy] Operator? Oh thank god. I want to call London. - [Operator] Do you have the number? - [Billy] Yes, I have it. 22-22-7822. - [Operator] Can you wait a moment? - [Billy] Yes, I'll wait. (ongoing reporting in the background) - [Recording] You have reached the offices-- - [Billy] Doctor Ingrid? - [Recording] Pharmaceutical research group. Business hours are from 10 to seven-- - [Man] This is Radio One, British Information Service-- - [Billy] Hey, wait a minute! (woman yelling) (radio announcement sounding) - [Man] To remind you for you convenience and safety that there is a state curfew in effect until 6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. The police are not in the streets, so you shouldn't be either. Radio One will resume its broadcast schedule-- - [Woman] It's all right, go away. - Poo. (soft gentle music) The major beats me if I'm half asleep. Better to keep you from me. I worry that he'll sell me. Sometimes he keeps his favors away from me. Some people got together to kill him once, but he flew away from them and then the farmers hid him out for four days and the potter shriveled up and died. - [Woman] I'm going to count backwards from 10 to zero, starting with your toes. 10, feel all the muscles slowly relax in your feet. - I don't like girls very much. - [Woman] Nine, all the muscles from your ankles up to your knees. Eight, your legs feel warm. Seven, all the muscles relax from your hips up to your back and across your shoulders. Six-- - I'll bet you smell nice. And I don't really want to leave you anymore. But the major will probably send me away after he finds out. I'm not too afraid of him really. There's not much he can do. It doesn't even matter if I die. I just don't want it to hurt like tonight when you hit me. That wasn't fair. Tony likes that. He likes people to hit him. - [Woman] Zero, that's fine, very good. Just let yourself drift into a deep comfortable state of relaxation down deep, comfortable and completely letting yourself breath easily and comfortably as a deep profound sense of relaxation sinks in. You can always hear my voice and you will listen closely to what it is I am about to say now. As you continue to relax, all outside sounds will fade away and lose importance. The only thing that matters is listening to my voice and sinking ever deeper into that nice deep state of relaxation. That's fine. Now I'm going to count to five and as I count, you will slowly come up toward wakefulness and by the time I reach five, your eyes will open and you will be wide awake feeling alert and rested and refreshed. Ready to come up, one, two, three, coming up, four, five, wide awake. (soft menacing music) - [Man] We'll have to mutilate you, lad. First fingers then ears. - [Man] Christian Democratic government of the U.S. today released the list of state executions for the week of September 11th. Among the 11 names were four more military officers implicated in the Charlotte coup, plus Captain J. Spense, chairman of the board of the Xerox corporation, former senators, Paul Krasner and Shirley McClain, comedian Richard Dreyfus and underground Marxist playwright, John Stockwell. The secretary at Falwell has announced that he expects an end to the executions by the first week in October. To quote secretary Falwell, the whole nation breaths a sigh of relief to be rid of these vicious animals. More interracial rioting was reported today in the cities of Bloomington, Lexington, Knoxville, Fort Lauderdale and Atlanta in reaction to the Christian government's announcement a week ago of a return to Apartheid policies within perimeters of the U.S. Proper. Fortifications have been increased along the borders of the 10 states South Eastern area, separated from the rest of the U.S. by the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. There have been numerous mercenary counter attacks by the national socialist and Manson Lincoln clan on isolated black outposts around the periphery. Meanwhile, the black army past centered in Washington D.C., the former the capital of the U.S., continues to beef up Blackwater operations through various military and economic aid offered by the coalition ofAfrican states. The executive council of Niamia of the Christian Democratic state has announced its willingness and intention to use all military capabilities if provoked. Earlier this year, the province of New Jersey was pounded with several small scale tactical nuclear warheads as punishment, according to the church, for its moral negligence. (beeps) The sciences of micro computers and penology have anything to say to each other? Well, according to engineers in Bisparten German Province, micro-electronics are about to have a very large role in crime and punishment in the near future. Among the space age devices the German technicians have developed are tiny, almost invisible implants for the teeth, which when activated by criminal thoughts, cause severe and unrelenting pain for 10 hours at a stretch in the teeth, jaw, and lower skull, new wonders from the world of science from the German Province. University students in the Norwegian Province report yet another record broken in the great gum chewing contest. Neil's Nielsen, also known as Jaws Nielsen, claims to have masticated some 380 sticks of the gummy concoction simultaneously. (engine humming) (radio reporting in the background) - [Billy] You made it all up, didn't you? - [Boy] No, no, I-- - [Billy] No one's making you do anything, are they? Are they? (horns honking) Sure, let's go talk about it. - [Boy] No, you're hurting me. - [Billy] I'm not hurting you, man, come on, you can walk. You wanted it, so now you got me. - [Boy] The major takes care of us. He's good to us. He makes the food come on the trains and he's the police. He's always been here. He made the laws. The major's men, John and Nemo, they'll do anything for him. Most of the time, they just check up on the girls to make sure they're not abused by the men that they service, but they're meaner than he is and sometimes they go overboard. So I'll hate to see what happens to Tony when they catch him. Tony hates the major and the major hates Tony, but the major doesn't think that Tony's important enough to have an actual manhunt for him. Many people are afraid to go to the ocean because Tony might appear all of a sudden. He really knows that beach like no one else and he says there's treasure there, but you really shouldn't befriend him. I'll be your friend. I'll be enough. The Dutchman is this man who comes to town. He picks up boys when we've got them and he takes them to places like Arabia or North Africa. I've gone before several times actually and it's not bad. (many voices talking at once) - [Woman] Billy, I want to talk to you about pain. Do you remember pain, it's a sensation? Look within your mind for means of controlling pain. You can learn how to use this. It is a fact that it is absolutely impossible to feel any kind of pain when you are completely relaxed, when your mind and your body are totally relaxed. (voices speaking over one another) - [Boy] Major says I have to earn my food because I don't have any parents, but that's not my fault and anyway, I'd work if they'd give me a proper job. I want to be a chef if I can get away from here. I think I'd be a good chef. (voices talking over one another) I'd be very careful not to burn anything and I'd learn how to make sauces. - [Woman] How do you feel about men? - [Boy] You're rich I think-- (voices talking over one another) everyday if you had that much hot water. I could cook for you and answer the door. If they let you go, they're not so smart-- (voices talking over one another) - [Woman] You have learned this quickly. - [Woman] Have you ever felt there was anything feminine about you? (voices talking over one another) (soft distorted music) - [Woman] Billy, do you understand, Billy, do you understand, Billy, do you understand, Billy, do you understand, Billy, do you understand, Billy, do you understand, Billy, do you understand, he wants to kill you, like he killed your father, like he killed your, like he killed you father, father, father, so you must kill him first, so you must kill him first, so you must kill him first. (soft eerie music) (dog barking in the distance) (soft eerie music) (raining) (soft eerie music) - [Woman] Roast the joint at 375 degrees, allowing 20 minutes to the pound, thus a three pound leg would take one hour and 20 minutes. Baste frequently with drippings during roasting. Take eight large mushrooms-- (voices talking over one anther) - I've been wanting to meet you, boy, more out of curiosity than anything substantial. We get very few young Americans down here. Would you care for some wine? Not awfully good, but drinkable. By the way, Sally tells me he took you up to the auction yesterday. - Listen, what's this all about anyway, you know? - Well, it's not about anything, I imagine. Drink up. When you get as old as I am, you get nosy, you know. I only want to know about any interesting new faces around. Julie Church is a fine gal, isn't she? Did you enjoy yourself? - So you are having me followed, aren't you? Sally John told me you're having him spy on me. - Balls. You see that fly up there? It's got more brains than Sally. You know, it certainly is a shame that you young people today can't join the foreign service because you can't work yourself into society. You can't influence society. You can't give orders and that's how you get to know people, isn't it, giving them orders? - Yeah, whatever. What's this have to do with me? Why do you want me? I think you're trying to keep me here to be one of your boys like Sally John. - I'm not keeping you here. You're free to go anytime you'd like. There's a train out for Swansea at 1:00. You can still make it if you hurry. (church bells ringing) (car hums by) What do you think, Smith? The kind of gossip that Sally John is spreading could bring pestilence to our model community. He's giving away our family secrets. (rumbling) (squeaking) (bell rings) - [Announcer] Kevin Brown, convicted murderer of German prostitution commissioner, Earnst Keln, today committed suicide in his cell. He apparently bludgeoned himself to death by hitting his head against the concrete wall. Brown, whose speedy trial gained him life in prison was a young American Army deserter. It is speculated that he may have been a male auxiliary to a technically sophisticated feminist terrorist organization. American refugees continue to land on the western coast of England in unprecedented numbers ever since the announcement by the Holy Catholic Empire of Consolidated Ireland that it would no longer accept the tattered and starving survivors. The Catholic government has reportedly been turning away the boat people from America at all its ports. The current flow of refugees has been greatly increased by the growing number of draft dodgers among them. Surveys indicate that public sentiment is turning strongly against the illegal aliens from the states from U.S. president, Calvin has labeled war criminals. The American chief of states has called for all nations of the world to turn back the boat people to the punishment of the sea. - [Woman] Welcome to the beautiful gardens of Brendovery, the village where your pleasure is our business. - [Woman] Billy, do you understand the dread consequences? What are the dread consequences? Do you understand the wonderful rewards? - [Billy] Yes. - [Woman] What are the wonderful rewards? So what happens when you kill someone? - [Billy] They go to Heaven. - [Woman] Are you happier there? - [Billy] Yes. - [Woman] Are you happy, Billy? - [Billy] Yes. - [Woman] Do you want to die? - [Man] There are large crowds collecting outside the theaters beginning to amass in early morning hours before the first feature. They mill about attempting to pilfer or appropriate tickets into the small air conditioned cubicles. Several riots have broken out within the past week and the small security forces being maintained within each theater. The U.S. film industry, centered in the emirate of Texas, is one of the most prolific film industries in the world, producing as many as 500 motion pictures yearly. Spokesman for the industry have indicated that security costs for the protection of prints are the singles largest item in their budgets. - Hey friend, the bench is free, you know what I mean? Might as well sit as stand. Take a rest. - [Man] About their marketing difficulties. - Oh, by the by, do you want to get high with me? - [Man] Which of course, would normally work to our advantage, but the crowd seeking admittance are so anxious-- - All right, but isn't your name Billy Hampton? I've been hearing about you. You came to visit Carrie Kennon. Hm, you like to get high? It's very good dope. - [Man] We are furiously considering divesting the company of its motion picture division and placing all our resources in the promotion of our line of recreational drugs. - [Boy] Did you come over on the boats? Are things really that bad back home? - [Man] In a related story, at the premier last week of a film in nearby Ocean City, Maryland, movie goddess, Steva Maria Ahoe was attacked by zealous fans-- - I left Richmond last year. I got busted for dealing dope to college students, good market, but dangerous. They caught me with paper acid and hash. They just about put me away for life so I split. - [Man] The gas mask was a method of protection-- I've got a place up near Greenbrook. Do you want to stay there for a while? Know what I mean, sleep a little? My old lady'II make us some tea. (engine revs) Come on! - [Man] You should know the location of the evacuation centers in your area. Keep your television or radio on at all times and you will be notified the instant a disaster occurs. Then proceed immediately to an evacuation center with only the possessions you can carry in your arms. When you are away from your home, make no attempt to return there. At times, it will cost you your life. This message has been spoken by the Atomic Energy Commission. - [Man] The universal Holy Catholic Empire on the consolidated Ireland, today issued an ultimatum to the common market central calling for an enforced compliance with its recently issued moral charter drawn up to-- (audio interrupted) (rustling) - Look, it's okay, you know what I mean? I know who they are. They just want to scare us. Come on, fast! (sloshing) (suspenseful soft music) (sloshing) (fires gun) (running water) (suspenseful soft music) (fires gun) (splashing) - [Man] There he goes! (splashing) I can't get across. We'll get him later. (rushing water) (running water) (birds chirping) - [Man] Of delinquent payments on current contracts constituting what Israel contends is a breach of contract. (church bells ringing) Today's action appears to be the culmination of the long U.S. Israeli Cold War, stemming from the early 80's Christian Democratic backing of a Palestine state and the related mandatory exec-- - [Billy] I remember watching this lizard crawl through the fence one time and he got his head stuck in the fence and everyday, I would go out and look at him. By about the second day, I guess he was dead, but each day I went back, he was a little more decomposed and then after about a month or so, there was just the skeleton whose head still stuck through the fence. (disjointed audio voices) (eerie slow music) I built this little village out of sand and mud and sticks. The sticks were telephone poles. It was just my little village and I worked on it everyday. When I was 13, I could remember that because I had Rheumatic Fever and I was in the hospital for almost a year. There was a couple days like when they didn't know what I had, but they knew I was real sick and I knew from just the way about everybody was acting around me that I was real sick. And I remember a kid was in the room next to me. They told me that he went in for surgery. (disjointed voices) (eerie music) And I was really worried. I remember my dad come in one night and he said, and he was holding me, and he was looking at me and was crying and he said, man, I wish I could trade places with you right now. I mean, my old man's a great son-of-a-bitch, you know? He had this big Rolls Royce. It's really a cool car and we stopped down in front of like a store, the bank, or anywhere in town, people would come out and people would be gathered around looking at it and stuff and I always felt really cool cause he'd be driving me away, he'd put me in the back seat and he'd open the door for me like I was some diplomat or something. (distorted eerie music) Men? I like men. I think I feel closer to men than women. Soft, warm, there's a camaraderie, coveted I feel with men. I feel like there's some things I can share with men that I just can't share with women. It's rounded, rounded. It's not that I have anything against women or that I think they're Iesser or anything like that, it's more-- - [Billy Overlapping Voice] Protective of my mother. - [Billy] A kindred spirit, I find through my fellow man. (screaming) (rustling) (birds chirping) (soft eerie music) (screaming) (wind gusting) (thunder rumbling) (wind gusting) (scuffling) (low menacing music) I'm like a ghost, you know. I go wherever they call me. - [Man] Following the U.S. nationalization of all private oil holdings and reserves last August, representatives of the lateral nations of Exon, Dow Chemical, and Shell Carbide announced today, they have issued formal petitions for asylum within the Emirate of Texas. - [Woman] Why Billy, we were worried about you. Well it's good to have you back. Stay as long as you like. - [Man] 1983 oil embargo and the first mega-war-- - [Woman] You caught us just right when we were leaving to go shopping. Our daughter, Barbara is home. I'm sure she'd love to meet you. - [Man] I wouldn't associate with Tony boyo. He's an outlaw. You're very lucky that we came along when we did. That boy can do a lot of damage to you if you give him the chance. I guess you found that out, hm? - [Woman] We'll see you in a bit. (door closes) - [Man] The nationalization of any 5th world or lateral arm holdings and all such holdings are protected by world council charter. So far, however, the U.S.-- - [Billy] What were you looking at? - [Man] Has managed to override the oil nation's partial voting privileges and to table-- - [Billy] Hey come on, what are you doing? (whining) - [Man] In a related incident, the church has mandated its foster company, Texas Instruments, to take preventive strike measures against any attempts to tamper with or dismantle current oil possessions exclusively at Texas company prior to the Texas succession, TI has been responsible on several occasions for the leasing of private nuclear weapon systems to the church. TI has given no formal indications of its intentions, but the company's lack of any quick response appears to be some indication of being caught up in conflicting allegiances. (bell rings) (heavy breathing) - [Woman] Oh. - [Billy] Why do they want me? You know, I know you know. (heavy breathing) (church bells ringing) (heavy breathing) (soft eerie music) - [Woman] Oh, you mustn't leave now. - [Man] No Billy, stay here. - Have a seat, we'll put on some music. - [Man] You've already caused enough trouble-- - [Woman] Having poor Sally John killed. - [Man] Mm, you mustn't go, they'll get you too, you know. - [Woman] Billy, where is there to go? - [Man] The Nirad arms cartel, spirited by the radical members of Israel and South Africa (audio becomes distorted). (Ioud disjointed music) (radio announcement continues) - [Man] Today's action appears to be the culmination of the long U.S. Israeli Cold War stemming from the early 80's Christian Democratic backing of a Palestine state and the related-- - [Billy] You little fucker, you betrayed me. You knew all along. They're gonna cut me up, aren't they? (Ioud distorted music) (radio announcement) Jesus, Jesus, I let you love me. Why are you doing it, man? Why are you with them? Don't you care? They'll kill me, can't you see that? Well you don't have to follow them. - [Man] Down to current U.S. economic woes. The weapons deal currently under consideration consisted of 100 S99 strategic landium and air to water fighter crafts manufactured in France and Pakistan and an undisclosed sublets of laser, canon and satellite technology. (eerie distorted music) - [Billy] Hey Judy! Judy, wait! (eerie distorted music) (wind gusting) (eerie distorted music) (distorted melancholy music) God is a river. God flows, has a rhythm, has a feeling. It's an encompassing kind of a thing. I feel like I'm in the river. I only let people see what I want them to see. I feel god watching birds. I feel god looking at insects because our bodies are like masks. We'd like to thing that we're, we're open and all this bullshit (Iaughs), but we're not, we're not, no way, no way. - [Woman] Are you generally a trusting person? - [Billy] You can't trust anybody really with anything real personal cause the only people that ever fuck you are the people who really care about you. (slow eerie music) (waves crashing) (slow eerie music) Control how I act? Well, I don't like people to tell me what to do. I mean I'll do what you guys say and stuff. You know, it's cool. I don't care about that, but I don't have any time. I don't have any family, I'm not married or anything. I don't like to be told what to do all the time. Well what's wrong, is there something wrong? I mean, you're not gonna hurt me, are you? I don't care about that. I thought it'd be interesting. You're not gonna take me back. I'm kind of interested in medicine and stuff, science, biology, I used to like biology. Yes, well yeah. The experiment. Well, I need the job, I need the job. (distorted voice) (distorted music) Rats eating or something like that. You guys make me feel kind of like there's something-- - [Woman] You have a question? Please Billy, feel free at any time to ask any question you want about anything we are doing. (breathing) - [Billy] Paradise. Paradise. Paradise. - I was a major in the Indian Army at the time and we were in the southwest corner of India and we had, we were on an exercise and I took a platoon of men up to a mountain, it was shown on the map, and there was a plateau on top and when we got up, it wasn't very difficult getting up, when we got up to the top, we suddenly discovered there a native village. Because apparently these men Iived on the plains below. This would be only about up to three or 400 years ago and they were living in constant fear and not only of fear, because it was happening, of young children and old people being taken away and killed by, well there were tigers and they got really, they weren't ever killing any tigers themselves, so they had us all a pow wow and they decided that we will try and get rid of the tigers and to do this, we will, well work out a rigorous kind ofArmy maneuver you might say and to go up the mountain and get them out of the lairs which we know they were in. Well they duly went up the mountain and tried to flush these tigers out with very little success because the tigers were always managing to kill more of them than they ever killed tigers, so, we finally made the top and then they were running a bit short on food so they'd sent one man down to, half-way down the mountain, to obtain some of their provisions and he never came back. Another victim. They sent a second man and indeed, I believe they sent three or four, but none of these every came back so they thought to themselves. We are now absolute prisoners. We're up here, it looks pretty obvious, we're gonna stay up here. I, at the time, had absolutely no explanation what-so-ever and after they had originally Iived down in the plains, and they had finished up on the plateau where they still were and they had been driven out by these tigers and then it suddenly came across my mind to hear about it, but there are no tigers in that part of the country.
