It's not as if anyone can hear you this far out. Nice one.

You bellend, MDMA. It's been a while, man. Stuck with misery guts for the past six years. Now that I'm back at the farm with Ian, I could do with a bit of a blowout. She's a fucking lesbian now, did you know that? Well, I knew you could turn a woman. Definitely time to move on, pal. Look, we're gonna have a big one. All the boys are coming. All right. I love ya, you little beauty. Love you too, bro. What the? Jesus Christ. Get the fuck out of here! I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry. I thought you were down here. And well, whatever you've got in there, it stinks. There are flies down here. You going fishing, mate, or something? So where are you from, boy? Dublin, Ireland, originally. Just moved back here though. Whereabouts? Ah, Dumpling Farm, do you know it? Yeah, I've heard of that place, yeah. I've heard stories about that place. What stories? Another one, please. - Hey, man. - Hey. How many have you had? Can I have another one of those, please? You, my friend, are an alcoholic. Man, I don't feel great. Don't worry about that, pal. We'll soon sort that out. Fuckin' hell, mate. It's the middle of the afternoon, do you ever stop? You're only young once, mate. I tell you what, I can't wait for the party. It's gonna be wicked to see all the boys again. It's been too long man, every cunt's married with kids. It's not like I don't wanna settle down, there's just too much pussy around to do it yet. Besides, I'm a bastard to live with. I want to wank all the fucking time. Do you do that? No. It's like I'm addicted to fucking Pornhub. - You take card, right? - Yeah, there's a 1.58 tax. The other day I literally contacted my internet service provider to increase my bandwidth. Jesus. I was getting fourteen tabs open at the same time. Is that fine? Literally, do you know how long it takes to get through fourteen tabs? I'll tell you how long, an hour. That's how long it took me. This morning, in fact. Just cranking out, no bandwidth issues. Just feel it, more porn. I'm not a monster, I get it over and done with, finished, get out of there. I'm literally like, I set my alarm an hour early, I'll get my hour in pal. I'm basing like, my whole morning around it at the moment, gonna push a few things back. But, I'll have my hot water and lemon, I'll get my hour in and then, after that, I wont even think about it. It's the best thing about it. I won't even think about it till the afternoon. There's a wealth of content out there. It seems pretty good to me. It's not just me. It's not just me that does that. It's an epidemic. There's a big problem. I don't have a problem, but there's a big problem overall with that kind of thing. It's what it's come to. I mean, I'm not, I think everyone's the same, to be honest. People just don't talk about it, that's all. Very normal. Anyway, are you sure mate? It'll sort you out, you zombie. - No. - No? Okay, fuck it then. Look after my pint, I'm off to the bog. I just eat you all up. What the fuck? Jesus Christ. Christ. - Hey mate, how are you? - Hey, how's it goin', bud? This looks mad, man.
