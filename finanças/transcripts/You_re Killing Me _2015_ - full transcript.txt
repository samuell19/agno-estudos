[phone ringing] (Answering maching) Hi, leave me a message or text me like a normal person. [beep] Hey, it's me. Um... I just have a quick question for you, um... So if you... if you see somebody murder someone, and you don't turn in the person who did the murdering, what happens to you, or what happens to like, you and your friends do you... do you like, go to jail? Call me as soon as you can. I am so proud of you. You've only been on your own for one week and you're already making a connection with him. See. I told you that you were going to do great. Just, y'know, stay away from animals. He would hunt down these women and he would kill them. Then he would skin them and sew their skins together into a kind of skin suit. Hannibal Lecter! Leatherface! Wynonna Judd! -No.. No, the other one- -Ashley Judd! No, not the other Judd. The other guy from Silence of the Lambs! First name is an animal name... Buffalo Bill! Yes! Come on! Next one. Keep going Joe, you gotta have those papers ready. Go, go, go. I have no idea who this is.. Oh my God. Are you an idiot? No... She played Jenna on 30 Rock {end-italic}. Oh yeah, and she was in Vacation. She kissed her Dad! The Chevy Chase vacation movie is about incest? No - that's Juliette Lewis. She sucks his thumb. No, no, no, Juliette Lewis is in Christmas Vacation -I've never seen that. -What? Oh. It's SO good. You HAVE to see it. Andy, do you still have that DVD we stole from that cabin? That was such a fun trip. I'm still so mad I missed that trip because of that asshole Tom who stood me up. His tinder profile even said, "I'm an asshole." Well, when people tell you who they are, believe them. Oprah. Joe, are you still gonna go? I think it's your turn still... Oh, I didn't know we were still playing. Ah, Cape Fear {end-italic}. That's the movie Juliette Lewis puts something in her mouth, it's Robert De Niro's thumb. (Emma) You know what's crazy, I've never seen that either. (Cameron) Oh my God. Give me a minute, let me just write down all of these. Wait, Cape Fear {end-italic}is not like a killer/slasher thing, right? Oh, no, no, no, I can't watch those kind of movies. Movies like that are so bullshit, the killer's are almost always someone the victim knows. [timer dings] Okay, let's reset the timer for Joe. Can we stop for one second. I don't really know what's happening? We're starting the timer over because these crazies won't stop interrupting the game. You love it. I'm gonna go for Joe since he doesn't know celebrities. Okay Joe? Could we just stop for a second? -Who's timing me? -I am. Go. This is just really confusing. Tiny weird looking woman, -won an Oscar... -Linda Hunt! Sorry, Andy and I have this Linda Hunt thing... I fucking love her... A 90's talk show host. Jesus Christ, that could be ANYBODY. -Rosie O'Donnell. -No. -Ricki Lake. -No. .Sally Jesse Raphael. -No. You know, it's RAY-phi-el. -Barbara Walters? -90's talk show host! It's RAW-phi-el No I am 100% positive it is Sally Jesse RAY-phauel! Cameron, you need to be less certain because it's RAW-phi-el. Ok, I think we're done with this game? One idiot player on a team can kinda ruin the whole game. (Emma) Wow. I told you I'd be terrible at this. You were pretty bad. Let's get a refill. Anyone? Oh yeah, just bring the whole bottle. Jenny Jones, of course. Emma that's your handwriting. Yeah, I wrote this clue. It got really aggressive in there. They're being funny. Well how am I suppose to know all this stuff? Look, the whole attacking each other thing is just their way of showing that they like you. Man, Joe is so handsome. So handsome. Is he? I was so busy with the game I didn't really notice. Andy seems to really like him. Really? Did he say that? Maybe just smile more. Make them laugh. Joke. I don't really joke. What do you mean? I don't joke. Okay. Is this weird? What? Andy's new boyfriend. It's been six dates, they're not boyfriends. Are they? Okay, so clearly this is weird for you. Can we not do this, okay? Aww Louis, I loved you guys together. I know, you guys were so good together. I don't think they like me. Of course they like you. You're gorgeous. Mmmm. Okay... I think I know what'll make you feel better. Hold on a second What are you doing? I'm giving you my sexy look. Oh. Y'know, we've been dating for a week, and we haven't had sex yet. That's kind of a first for me. Because I'm a slut. Well, I told you, I have to take things slow. I recognize that sexy look now. Come here. You have people here. They don't care if we slip away for a second. They're in Broadway mode. (Cameron) Patti Lupone! I say we wait. Okay. Fine. But tonight's the night. For what? You're not going to make me wait any longer. Tonight you are all mine. If I ever get a boyfriend, I'm going to do whatever it takes to make it work. I'll never give up. I'll never give up. What are you guys doing in there?... Hey can I play my new song for you? You know what, now is not a good time. Did I tell you about my new script idea? I don't think so. Yeah, you don't know anything about it. Okay, so anyway it's amazing. Okay so... The movie opens with this woman. She's driving her car, and she's like rockin' out to some christian music. She's like reallly getting into it. And then she drives by this car with all these people outside of it. And the audience should get the sense that something is off because the people are acting really weird. But this woman is totally oblivious. Because... Well, okay, what the audience doesn't know is that this woman is actually in an abusive relationship. -Oh my God. -And... yeah. Because she was like married when she was 15, and her dominating husband used to beat her. But now, he's really old and sick, and bed-ridden, and um, she has to take care of him. When the car pulls up on the side of the road... I'm totally picturing Lily Tomlin. Oh, you know, that would be great. -Yeah? -Yeah, Yeah. -Okay, so she pulls over... -Do you know her? Mmmm, we've... been at events. But, when the car pulls up on the side of the road... I found Joe hoarding the wine. I don't even drink. You don't drink? No. I'll take that. You're not in AA are you?

I've been patient, Joe, but this is fucking crazy. It isn't crazy. What is wrong with you? I don't think I love you. Love? I don't need you to love me. I just need you to put your fucking dick in my ass. I'm feeling weird. Are you like, home-schooled or something? No. Do you have an STD? God, you don't like, have warts or something do you? No. Then what the fuck is wrong with you? You're being kind of a dick here. What are you into? I will do whatever you want. Joe, I will do anything that you want. Anything. I don't know... Oh come on. There's got to be something that you want to do. Huh? Yeah. That feeling you're feeling right now. Just let it take you over. Release the beast within. Really? That thing that you want to do - do it to me. Well there's this one thing... Okay. Wha... Well you forgot your shoes! ♪ Welcome to People I want to... [door closing] Joe? [noises in other room] Joe?

Why on earth are you carrying a machete? Well, it's to chop you into pieces with. Chop me into pieces? Why would you want to do that? Well, it's much easier than burying your body whole. Let's be honest, it is not easier to chop someone into pieces than it is to bury them whole. You're right, but well, it's a lot more fun. [laughing] Oh you kids. I blame video games. What about a take onDuck Dynasty called Fuck Die Nasty? Okay, and we make a dildo that like, when you suck on it it shoots out vanilla cream. -Oh my God! -How is that a video? Well, it's a dildo and when you suck on it it shoots out vanilla cream. So, you want me to put a dildo in my mouth and pretend to suck it off for a youtube video? -No. -Look, what if we just do something that's really simple? What if it's just like, this or that? Ugh. What? Just like you have to choose between two things- That doesn't make any sense. Let's not do that. The premise doesn't matter, it's not like you guys ever stick to the script. Gretchen our last video got 1,000 views. I think we know what we're doing. What if... we do something that actually has some meaning? Like it's about something important... What if we did something really character-y? You know, like, what if we were just like two crazy people -who run like, a cooking show? -Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Two midwestern pieces of white trash, who have to work in like, a five star restaurant? Oooo, I love it! We'll go wig shopping! Yeah, but we did that drag-y web series last summer- Yea but that was Pam and Tabby and they're hairdressers not cooks. These are totally different wigs. Exactly. I did just read this really interesting book about gender theory and it had this whole chapter about men in... Fine. We're gonna do it. [doorbell rings] I really think this is gonna be the one.

And her boyfriend. -So she pays you? -That's kinda sexy. And a little sad. It's his job! Did you guys come up with a new TV show? I told you, it's not a TV show, it's a web series. You know, I plan on playing a blonde bombshell in our next video. Do you like blondes? Uh. Sure. Oh you do? And brunettes. Wait... what just happened? Did I just get in trouble here? Right, we'll see you Saturday. Okay, great. -Nice to meet you Teddy. -Yeah, nice to meet you. -You're so obnoxious. -What? Seriously, I have a question. If they have sex after they work out, does that make Teddy a sex worker? Because if so I would totally pay for that, he's really hot. Who's hot? You.

Oh, did you? It was a lot harder than I thought. [chuckles] Emotionally? Physically. It was exhausting. I've never killed a person before. Only small animals. So you kill small animals? I love it. And what do you do with all those little... animal corpses? Oh, I'm getting into taxidermy. Of course you are, classic. How about you? One time I put a garbage can over a squirrel in my backyard. But I didn't kill it, I just forgot it was there. Oh, you killed it. No, it probably got away. No, you killed it. Well, it's still not as cool as killing a person though. So, here's your gold star for weirdness. I'm George. Joe. Hi Joe. Hi George. So do you live in this neighborhood? No. I was just waiting for you. So what? You're like... stalking me on the sidewalk?

God, that kind of thing NEVER happens to me. Well you don't really give off inviting energy. What does that mean? -You have an angry nose. -No I don't. I do? Angry noses can be really sexy. Is my angry nose sexy? I just told Joe that I was looking forward to seeing him and he said that was great. Also I'm more of a relationship kind of person. I'm not really a come up and cruise me in the middle of the street kind of guy. No offense but that's a little weird. -Joe's coming to game night. -My game night? -Um hmm. -Uh... -Is that okay? -Yeah, it's fine.

And did I mention that he's like, crazy hot? Yeah. A few times. He saw our video. The "People I Want to Kill" one. Thought it was hysterical. He has a really twisted sense of humor. Oli really liked that video too. So... Also he doesn't have a job. So I think he might be a trust fund baby. Oh that's great. That's just what LA needs. I just sent him an emoticon and he asked how I did it. What!? He doesn't know what an emoticon is? Those are those happy faces you send in texts, right? [laughs] Look, look at this. Look at this face my daughter just made. -Tabby. -That's neat. That's really funny. -That is neat. -She sent you a face. She did that with letters... She's very creative. She's great. Where is Jimmy? He's supposed to come over here and clean up this permanent solution. -I know. -Every time -I ask him to do something -Um hmm. He just gives me some awful look. Um hmm. Jo Ann and I call that his murder look. What is a murder look? Well it's when he looks at you real intense like, you know and tilts his head down like he's about to kill you.

Honestly, I wasn't sure if you'd be back to killing cats. (Barnes) You're kidding me right? Sister Act One over Sister Act Two? Okay, I think it's just Sister Act. Not Sister Act One. It's not like you'd say, Home Alone One {end-italic}!" -I do! -Why is he shouting?! Gretchen directs all our videos. And she also may be paying her boyfriend for sex. We are not sure.

You know Barnes, I had a really hard time in Catholic School, and Sister Act {end-italic}has always been difficult for me. Oli? Yeah. I saw Sister Act One. Oh that's cool. Can you put down your phone for ten fucking minutes? We have company! This is exactly why Gretchen doesn't bring any of her boyfriends over for game night!

Wait, did they just take our bottle of wine? I think they did. Should I kill them? Now you're just looking for an excuse to do that. I guess so. That was like a ten dollar bottle of wine though. Are Barnes and Oli coming back anytime? Ooh, I don't know. They're like the poster boys for relationships that have reached their expiration date. Oh! They are? And he's such a dick to Barnes. I mean like, we had this video go sort of viral a couple weeks ago, well not viral but Adam Lambert tweeted it, and he never even said, congratulations. -He didn't? =No. -Congratulations. -Thank you.

Cute. -Thank you. No, he is quiet, and I think that's cool. I mean, I don't always have a competition to get a word in edgewise. Okay...

Not recently. 'Cause I'm here at his house right now. I, I, I... He wasn't returning my phone calls so I came here. And his front door was unlocked, and his phone was just sitting here. You were the last person to see him. Is he mad at me? Did he say anything? Or is he... avoiding me? I shouldn't answer that. So he's mad at me. Okay, is he with you right now? Can you please put him on? No, he's not here. Just ask him what I did. [stutters] Just put him on. Just forget about him Louis. I didn't do anything! I don't want to talk to you anymore.

No. You know, I don't know if you are fantasizing or not, but either way, we have got to get you back in here. All right, because I need to evaluate these thoughts that you're having. Why didn't you just tell me if I killed people, I'd feel normal? Okay Joe, what is that look? This is the look you give before you kill someone. After all that I've done for you, and all the help I've given you, you would kill me? Yeah. Why? Well, I guess it's just because I want to. I'm sorry if that's not good enough. I wish I had a more profound answer. Joe. [yells] [choking sounds] [struggling to breathe] (George) He is SO into me. (Barnes) Yea? (George) Yeah, I feel like, he would do anything for me. Like, anything. There's one problem though, two problems really. Alright, here's the George I know. Well, we haven't really done anything sexual yet. You haven't put your fingers in his butt yet? -No. -Hmm. Andy has this really dark sense of humor. Like, he's always joking about killing people. Who? ME?! No. Not you. But like, the other day he said he was gonna kill Teddy because he was jealous of him. Hmm. At first I thought it was funny, right? But now it's like, I get it. Okay, so he keeps talking about killing all your friends? Yea, and his parents. That's not what people do. That's like, scary. Well he's not scary... he's gorgeous. He just has a weird sense of humor. And it's the joke we met on, so it's sort of his thing. When people tell you who they are, you're supposed to believe them. Did you just quote Oprah on me? It's actually Maya Angelou. But honestly George, you have to stop doing this. Doing what? Your relationships never last. You lose your head over some guy and fifteen minutes later we never hear about him again. Honestly, I can't invest in someone you care about because I feel like it's never a REAL relationship. Oh, so what, I'm supposed to be like you? You were with Oli for what, a year, and why, because you were too lazy to end it, or were you just too afraid of being alone? -George. -No, I want an answer. -Were you too lazy to end it? -That's not fair. No, what's not fair, is you putting all your baggage onto ME! -Knock knock. -Hi. Here she is, boys. Hey Barnes, I'm sorry about you and Oli. Oh, I'm glad you guys could make it. You guys didn't bring ice by any chance, did you? No. Were we supposed to? No. Gretchen was supposed to, but she never texted me back. Oh, that fuckin' bitch. Do you have a wine opener? Don't need ice for Chardonnay. "You don't need ice for Chardonnay, -the Cameron Lipsky story". -You know it. (Barnes) Bottle opener should be in that drawer behind you. It's so nice to get together and not have to play a game. I'm sorry, could it be somewhere else? I don't know, George have you seen the wine opener? -No. -I mean, if you guys do want to play a game, I could be talked into it. -Barnes invited Louis. -Did he? (Emma) Oh, that's nice, we never -we never all hang out anymore. -These are plates. OH! Did I tell you guys about Andy? Who's Andy? Oh you know Andy, Andy Lovell, The hot, hunky guy. Louis's ex. Yeah, Louis was so totally fixated on him. So... [makes a fanfare noise] I finally started seeing someone. At work, this guy Glen, And, I wrote a song for him. So, do you have one of those things where you can just plug the speaker into my iPhone, and I could just play it for you guys? Anyway, Andy is missing. Like your fucking wine opener! (Barnes) Missing? Yea, no one has seen him for a while. You know, that explains it because I sent him a video and he hasn't even liked it yet. Yeah, he was supposed to go to Berlin on a work trip. Aw. I wanna go to Berlin. Yeah, well Louis is freaking out, but then again, he always freaks out about everything... Ah, look, I found it! What? Oh, thank God! Oh, have you guys heard about George's new love? I am not in love. Ooh... Who's the guy, George? His name is Joe, and he's super weird. He isn't weird. -Okay, he's a little weird. -He is super creepy. You know Barnes, I wish you'd just stop. He's really sweet, and he's the first guy I've dated in a long time that I actually like, so for once can you just drop the bitchy gay guy shtick? Oh my fucking God, it was a twist off. (Joe) Hey Louis. Joe? What are you doing here? Why are you looking at me like that? -Is Andy here? -No. But I don't think it's a good idea if you go inside. Why? I'm seeing this new guy. Wait, you're not seeing Andy anymore? No. Actually, could you stand right over here? I thought you... Well, you know Andy and I used to be together. Could you stand just on the other side of the bricks? What? No. Why? Well, I just thought it'd be easier if you weren't right in front of the window, but... What would be easier? [whacking sound] ♪ [blender sounds] George, what's your guy's name again? -Joe Palmer. -What? Joe Palmer. Joe Palmer? That sounds so familiar. -He loves our videos. -Really? Oh, Joe Palmer. He was at Louis's game night last week with Andy. Yes! You guys played games last week? Well yeah, well he was dating Andy. Yeah, before Andy disappeared off the face of the Earth. Joe Palmer was dating Andy? -Yeah. -Oh, wow George. So, the guy you're dating who jokes about murder all the time has an ex who disappeared? -Oh that's nice. -Wow. Barnes is just trying to start shit. No I'm not, I'm not trying to start shit. I'm just pointing out that the guy you're obsessed with is kind of a freak! Joe, you're here! Sorry. Hey, you got something on your face. Got it. [chuckles] So, I guess you guys all know each other. -Yeah, from um...last week. -Hi. Hey Joe. Andy's missing. Okay I know we said no games, but let's play Card Rule, til Gretchen and Teddy get here. Oh Jesus, I hate that game. Can't we just drink? I didn't know you dated Andy. Yeah, I told you about him. Yeah, I guess I just didn't realize I knew him. Joe, have you played this before? [giggles] I don't think so. (Cameron) Barnes, you made up this game. It's okay, we'll play as a team. -No teams. -Yeah, no teams. It's basically like war, but if you play an Ace you can't speak for an entire round. It's easy. You'll get it. Barnes you go first. Barnes! I'm flushing out the good cards. Ugh! Sorry Cameron. You can't talk! She can't talk til the next round, but she's not out. If you play an ace, you can't talk. I get it. Not to worry! What? Boom! Oh, you can't talk. Okay, my turn, oh triple whammy! Oh... -I can't believe... -No talking! Uh... What if I don't have an Ace? If you don't have an ace, you have to pick up the whole pile. -Pick it up. -Shhhh! [mouthing directions to play] Hey, where are Gretchen and Teddy? They're dead. [snickering] We killed them. Well, I killed them. (George) I told you guys. He has a twisted sense of humor. (Cameron) No talking! You're strange, Joe. You don't look like you're joking. -I'm not joking. -You know what, I don't think that's very funny. (George) Okay Joe... -And George, you can't talk. Joe, it's your turn. I have all the cards. So why don't you play them? [chuckles] Okay... Well that didn't make any sense. You put down an Ace, which means you can't talk... You know what, doesn't matter, I'll pick it up. Yay! I can talk again. I'm sorry, I just have to say something. This game makes zero sense to me, I have no idea what's happening. Yeah, it's fine, we don't have to play the game anymore. Oh thank God. Thank you. [breathing sighs of relief] (Emma) Hey, that's mine! You know what, I'm gonna go make some more drinks. Can I play my new song for you guys? No, but I can show you pictures from Cancun? Okay. Can I help you with something Joe? I'm just getting a glass of water. The glasses are in the cabinet right there. You just needed a glass, right? Hey. Let's go upstairs. Okay. [chuckles] Where are you guys going? Ewww, you guys are guests in this house. That's very rude. -Ooh, ooh, me too! -Okay, okay, calm down. You guys, what was that? What was what? That was extremely creepy, right? You think you might be a little jealous? Jealous? Of Joe? No, I'm not jealous of Joe. No, I meant you're jealous of George. No, I'm not jealous of anyone. Oh my God, you're jealous of Joe? -You like George? -No, Oh my God! No, I'm not jealous. Oh my God, you're SO jealous of George! No, that's the thing, he's jealous of Joe! -What?! -You guys are stupid. This is Barnes' bedroom, huh? Um hmmm. He must like art. I guess, yeah. So did you tell Barnes about what we've done? About what? All the killings. How about we stop with the killing stuff? What do you mean? The killing stuff is not that funny. I'm very confused. Here... kiss me. You're in such a hurry. Can we finish our conversation? I, I... I'm feeling weird. No. Shut up Joe. Get off of me! [laughs] (George) What is wrong with you? [laughing] (George) Okay, what the fuck was that?! What did I do?

Oh my God, call the police! I mean ambulance. Go! Oh my God. Oh my God. -I think he's dead! -Oh my God! But he killed my hamster. [hamster squeaks] I don't know the number for an ambulance, do you just dial 911? -i don't know what you dial. -No. Just wait. What happened? He hit me. (Cameron) So you killed him? Barnes did. We need to call an ambulance right now. You weren't here, he went crazy, he was crushing her. Joe went crazy? You guys, we need to call an ambulance. They've got to help us. They've go to... (Barnes) {end-italic}Cameron! He's fucking dead all right? He's not breathing. I fucking killed him. We can't call anybody. Hey you guys, um... me and Cameron are just going to take a second. -Yeah. -What? Yeah, we're going to go downstairs and have a private conversation. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait... did... Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God! Did Barnes kill Joe because he's jealous? What? No! God. -Okay. -I don't know. Cameron, this is going to sound crazy, but is this some kind of conspiracy, like, is this a comspiracy that's happening? Are you, are you, where are you right now? I don't... we're calling 911. -He kills small animals. -What? That was one of the things he used to joke about. He does taxidermy. He doesn't joke. What are you talking about? Call Teddy and Gretchen. What? Just call them please! I'm not calling them right now. Fucking call them!! George! I am not calling them, they don't have anything to do with this. He could have killed them! What? Just call them please. Hey, it's me... Um... I just have a quick question for you. Um... [exhales] So if you... if you see somebody murder someone, and you don't turn in the person who did the murdering, what happens to you? Or what happens to like, you and your friend, do you, -do you like, go to jail or...? -Is that the police? Call me as soon as you can. What the fuck Emma?! It's my brother. He's really smart. -What? -He's almost a lawyer Cam. That was his voicemail?! Yes, he wasn't answering he's probably at work. Why would he kill his parents? I don't know. Because they were rude to me? -If what he told me is true... -Wait, what about Oli? No, just his parents, and Teddy and Gretchen. I knew there was something wrong with him. Can you go to jail for killing an insane person? I don't know. I think so. If he killed both his parents, and he doesn't have any friends, then no one knows he's here and we can just... get rid of the body. -How? -I don't know. Dump his body somewhere or something. Are you serious? We can't do that. George, I just fucking killed him, I could go to jail! You knew that he was killing people, and you didn't even call the police. I didn't know he was serious. Who's gonna believe that? This whole thing could ruin both our lives. Or, we could just, make it go away. Come on, come on... Come on answer! I've been on hold. I swear to God, it's rung like 27 times, and they put me on hold, like, what if there was a fire? Cameron, hang up. We can't just call the police, and not tell them we're calling the police. We have to give them the chance to realize it's the right thing to do. Come on, man, they're our friends. [phone rings] Hello? It's 911! What? Why did you answer the phone? I thought it would be my brother. [in fake accent] Hello, thank you for calling, I wanted you to know my neighbor's dog is very barky and loud, and is driving me crazy. Um hmm...yes...okay, thank you. That was really good. She was really mean. Come on guys, we're going to Griffith park. [trunk slams] (Radio Announcer) Investigators are linking the blaze to a cover up of the murder of District Attorney, James Palmer and his wife. The couple's son, Joe Palmer, is missing. It is estimated that the fire caused over forty-five million dollars worth of damage including the home of Sally Jesse Raphael... See? Rauphael. An Australian catamaran is home today... [radio clicks off] So he really was a killer. He killed his parents. It's a good thing to kill a killer. I mean, we stopped him, right? Okay, I'm sorry, why are Emma and I here? Joe used to joke that you could take a dead body, and leave it in Griffith Park and the coyotes would eat the evidence. I mean, at least I thought he was joking. Gross. They want animals to eat his body? If they try dragging us into this shit, I'm gonna be SO pissed. That stuff I was saying earlier about a comspiracy... I'm just saying. Do you guys even know if hitting someone with a laptop would kill them? People are harder to kill than you think. What about Andy? Andy? What do you mean? I mean, he probably killed Andy too, right? Oh my God. I mean, what are we in the middle of right now? Oh my God, you're right. He killed Andy. And Oli. Jesus Christ. What is happening?! (George) I don't know. Then why don't we call the police?! Because I KILLED him Emma! I don't want to go to jail! Okay Barnes... just, just, just think for a minute... Okay, you know there's no way we're gonna get away with this. Yeah, I am terrible at keeping secrets. -Wasn't it self-defense? -Kinda... What are we suppose to do guys? Take his dead body from the trunk and put it back upstairs in the bedroom? No, no, no, I think that's called tampering with a body. I mean, that will give you like two or three years? Three. Okay, so what is it people do? Do they just like take a dead body to the police and drop it off and say, hey sorry, we killed him, we don't know what to do! I mean, that seems nuts. But my rationality is really fucked up right now. What's the least crazy thing to do right now? [sneezes] I still think it's taking him to the park. So let's just put him in the fucking park.
