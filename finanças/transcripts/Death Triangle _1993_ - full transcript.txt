A Serious Shock! Yes Madam! Okay. Where is he? Right there. Who the hell are you? How dare you show up here? Hit him! What's going on? Lady, the man is possessed, and attacked two of our men. We don't know what to do with him. - Black magic? - Yes. Leave it to us. Hey sir, how are you? Who are you? I am the fairy Kwan Yin. Why don't you follow the Buddha? Shit! You're crazy! Crazy! Hey, wake up. Wake up. What going on, ladies? You're coming with us to the police station. Good morning, sir! I will say one thing: failure. Do you lose your spirit because of hurt feelings? One can never succeed without failure. You two are very capable police officers. Thank you, sir! Please, get up, let's get started. You are very beautiful, do I look good too? Stand a little closer together. Please, help me fix this. Wait a minute. Hey, what do you mean? How can you make me a bridesmaid? Do you want to make excuses? And it's too late for that! Hurry up. Come on, let me share your happiness. You are very naughty. Hush. It's messy. The photos turned out good. Are you gonna get them made bigger? Very good, you look the same. Where are we going? I'd rather find a guy and marry him. Or I will be very unhappy. You are not unhappy, but Ching Siu Chi is. Why don't you give him a chance? Don't talk about that idiot again. He's not an idiot, he's Siu Chi. You don't have to refuse every time, okay? My car! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey, you guys are some pretty weird cops, huh? We're with the Royal Police. We have to take your bike, thank you. Wan Chin, quick, follow her. Don't shoot, ladies! I'm pregnant, you'll kill two people! You're very brave to steal my car. Are you really having a baby? I don't think you're fit to raise a baby. Why would I need to be? The schools will take care of that. I didn't know it was your car, ma'am. You are in trouble now. I didn't know, ma'am. It's true! They told me the car is red Cimy, EL6879. I didn't know it was your car. Oh, you're corrupt. I'll tell you that. This is my fiancé's car. Is your fiancé Superintendent Tsiang? Congratulations. Now I know his wife. Hey! Are you finished? You're not the same as her, you look more like a concubine. What did you say? Move it! A concubine, a concubine is beating me! Didn't you say you wouldn't come into the station during the holidays? It's better than hanging around somewhere else. Did you come to see Officer Tsiang? No, I came for the wedding presents. There are definitely a lot of them. Wan Chin, our colleagues have given us many gifts. Let's go check on Bobby now, shall we? I'll take it for you. When are you gonna show me the new apartment? Sure.. But it's a mess right now, maybe another time. If you keep fooling around, I'll cut off your dick! You're going to cut me? Well then I'll throw acid on you! Why are they so angry? That's nothing. When they're at home, it's horrible! Please, come in. I'm telling you, I need the $100,000. Ask him to be careful if he doesn't want to return them to me. I want bail for Coco at the police station. Hurry, I'm serious! Ask for a receipt too, hurry up! Hurry! And? Are you going to pay the bail or not? Of course I'll pay it! But you have to copy your documents and sign the account, then I'll pay on time, that's the rule. You bastard! Are you trying to make me look like an idiot? Are you free tomorrow? Coco, it's $100,00. My debts are piling up, I have to be careful. We have to be fair about it, even though we.. I'm really sorry! It's family problems. You idiot. That's okay, I'm not angry. Here's my ID. Go make a copy. Lend me a pen. Let's go. So are you free? Can we go out to dinner tonight? Are you asking me out? Yes, and for a movie tomorrow. Okay? I'm really sorry. I said I could come back tomorrow. I drove for an hour, I'm so tired. Hello? Hello? I'll take a look upstairs. Hello? The wedding photos! Bobby, are you scared? I'll see if anything was stolen. It's gonna be okay. Hey, are we missing anything? I'm not, are you? I lost my watch and my chain. Maybe they just broke in for fun. Let's report it to the police. Okay. Everything okay? Go, move. Everything's okay. Don't go for the eyes or the undersides. Get ready. Ready? Start! Come on! Come on! Good try, come on! Stop! Again. Good work, keep going! Come on. Stop now! Stop! That's enough! Stop! May! May! Stop it! What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you alright? Call an ambulance! Be careful.. Why are you in here, May? Don't you know this is the men's locker room? You didn't want to talk to me in the girls' locker room, so I came in here. I will do anything! Excuse me.. Are you happy now? I don't want much. I just want to see you one more time. Don't think the wrong way anymore! Why do you have to do things like this, May? You're destroying my family and that's not how this works. You think it's all over, kicking me out like this? These are the rules of the game. Tell me, have you gotten it? You still have to pay, and don't put me in a difficult situation. I didn't lie to you. Just tell them I'm not in Hong Kong, and they won't be looking for me. What can they do to me then? That girl is pretty. It seduces me. Too hot! Yes, it's too hot. Yes, yes. Try this, it's delicious. Thank you. Hey, you owe Coco money and you haven't paid it yet. I really don't have any money, bro. I can't support myself if you force me. I wouldn't borrow from a money lender even if he had money! Coco, he says he has no money. Don't say such silly things! Even if I don't have money, I can still pay at least part of it! Coco. Go get it. Yes yes, I'll go get it. Will you pay me the interest? When you do, you have to return the profit! So talk! Yes, I will pay you part of it. I knew you needed to be slapped. So, you have to be forced first? You should've done it the first time. Yes. Eat something. Thank you. May, don't you have an aunt in England? Yes, I do. You'll have to visit us when you go there. Wilson applied for an open position for a job in England. Why didn't you tell me about this before now? I just found out yesterday. He didn't tell me right away, so as not to spoil the surprise. May.. I do not accept your letter of resignation. Do you really want to resign? Yes. I want to change. I don't want to keep doing this. I have a boyfriend. You don't have to resign if the reason is a boyfriend. My heart is very divided. I don't want my feelings to interfere with my work. He wants to get married soon. Okay, I accept your request. Thank you, sir. Bobby.. Come here, Bobby. Come and see Daddy's wedding pictures. Come here, Bobby. Aren't they beautiful? Look at this.. Just look, Bobby. Bobby? Bobby! What happened, Bobby? Bobby, be careful. What do you want? So you decided to leave me and move to England? That's right. I want to start over with Wan Chin. What about me? What will I do? Are you trying to get rid of me? Bobby. Bobby is very good. Wilson, when are you going to stop acting like this? I don't want you to leave. I can't bear to see you with another woman! I can't live without you! May! I love you! How far we have come.. I think we should be clear. I can't live without you! Wan Chin. I think we should end this now. Did you send these pictures? Yes. Where is Bobby? Wan Chin, when you promised to marry me 6 months ago, I decided to break up with her. You're lying! You didn't tell me that! You asked me to wait for you! - Please, let's start over. - Why, because you lied to me? This is absurd. May! You lied to me? Because you lied to me? Go to hell! May! I hate it when someone cheats on me! May, stop hitting him! Calm down! You'll kill him! Stop hitting him! May! Calm down! Get away from him! Get off of me! May! May, stop! You disgusting man! You lied to me! Damn you! Stop! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Are you okay? Wan Chin.. Go. May.. Wan Chin.. May, don't cry. No, no. Don't move! Don't move! May, don't do this! Why are you handcuffing her? This has nothing to do with her! I won't listen to this! Stop forcing me. She's your best friend. Why do you want to hurt her? Let me go! Give me the key! You wanna leave me and go to England. You are cruel! We could never live together! Why? I'll tell you why: I love Wan Chin, not you. Give me this! No! Stop it and give it to me! Wilson! Wilson! Are you okay? Don't move! Don't shoot! Stay still! I have to kill him! Run! She's gonna kill you! Hurry! Don't kill him! Please don't kill him! Wilson! Run Wilson! Do you want to run? Do you want to move to England and leave me all alone here? Let's see if you can. Are you afraid? You have nothing to worry about! You said! Wait there, I'll take care of you.. Come here, come here. May, take him to the doctor! Come here! No! Wilson.. I really love you. But you're leaving me and running away to England? Why? Why? Why are you being so unfair to me? Why? Why are you treating me like this? What did I do wrong?! Don't do this to me! May, leave me and take him to the hospital! We are friends. We were friends. I will not kill you. May? May? Tell me what's bothering you. May, tell me. I killed Wilson. Don't cry, don't cry. Wilson! Wilson.. You are suspected of murdering Superintendent Wilson Tsiang. Give me the gun and come with me to the police station. What do you mean, Kent? Come with me to the police station. Don't let her get away! Hello? Can I talk to Officer Wang? He's not? When does he come back? No, thank you. Officer Wang, I'd like to speak to Officer Wang. Who am I speaking with? Sergeant Hsie Wan Chin. Where are you now? We'll send men to fetch you. Hello? Sergeant Hsie, are you there? Hello? Hello? - Go help them. - Yes sir. Listen.. I live nearby, so I got here first. I saw Sergeant Hsie very angry, and she kept saying: "You hurt me!" That's all. And they were about to be married. Was there a third person? I strongly doubt it. I don't believe there's a third person. Should I write up the report? Boy.. How can you win by playing three? Who are you calling boy? Where's Coco? What do you want with her? I want her car. Wait. You scared me! Are you trying to steal cars again? How dare you still be so angry.. The police are offering $100,000 for you. Hey, what are you doing? I don't want the money. Did you really kill him? I didn't kill him. I don't want problems. It's bad when you're wanted by the police. I advise you to run away. I can't run away, it wouldn't solve anything. I'd be confessing my guilt for the murder. That's great! Do me a favor, I need a gun. I have nothing but this bracelet and watch. I'll come back again. Hey lady. I'm not your relative. Who are you to command me? I'm not your man. Do you think you're still a cop? What a pyscho. There's something wrong with her, dammit. I can do tricks too. Hsie Wan Chin? I want you to come with me to the police station and explain everything. Lady, get in the car! Why did you come help me? Dunno, ask him. He forced me. He's a good person. A nice guy? I thought he was dumb. He doesn't say anything. You're an idiot! Godfather! Godfather..? No, no, no. He's my godfather! No, leave it. No, I'll do it myself. My godfather. I don't know why I would do such a dangerous thing. Don't ask me. I prefer to do dangerous things. Is it hard for you? Isn't it hard for you? Now I really know.. ..what helplessness means. Nothing is working out. You can stay with me as long as you want, but I guess if they're looking for you, it would be better to hide. Where should I go now? This all happened so fast. I can't do anything other than being a police officer. Aren't you afraid of that woman betraying you? Remember she's not reliable. Be careful. When your best friend betrays you, you're not afraid of anything anymore. When I really needed help, only you and Coco helped me. Only you. My godfather. Hey, hey. What is it? Hey.. It's not safe enough up here, come down. It's safer here. Why are you so mysterious? What do you mean? Why don't we give her up and split the $100,000? Sure. Good idea. So you are that kind of person! What type? You'd betray your goddaughter for $100,000? No, take your foot off first. I was just testing you. No! I tested her. She's very honest. You can talk while taking a shower. Forget it. He's crazy. I have two weeks of vacation. Are we going to England? I hate England. No one in this world besides you can protect me. Promise to protect me forever? Okay? Don't worry, I will protect you forever. Take a look. Where are the bullets? No bullets. Until you pay. Okay, I'll get the money. Do you really have to kill that cop? She used to be my friend. I don't know if I'm going to kill her. But I'm sure she wants to kill me. Idiot! I told you! You know? One always takes advantage of the other! Hello? He ran away? Which school is his? What should I do now? Where should I look for him? Which hospital? Okay, got it. Thank you, bye. What happened? One of my relatives is in the hospital. Behind you! Let's split up! Hurry! Split up! Hey! Don't kill me, don't kill me! Don't shoot! Run! Let's go. You'll be fine, Gingin. I'll call your mother, okay? Does she know? Why didn't I know you had a sister and a nephew? Actually, I don't! You're saying you don't have a nephew or a younger sister? You have a son? So does that mean I'm the father? A man should be unselfish with a woman. I will take him as mine and then he will have a father. What do you think? Am I right? I'm bored, leave me alone! What happened? I'm saying that we need to get him a mother. Yes, where can we find her? Yes, where can we find her? It's difficult. I think that person could be you. No I can't, I'm too young. I really can't. No way! Why can't you? I can't! What's going on? Why? It smells like feces. Something is wrong, come with me! You bastard! Who are you? I'm asking! Shek Tong Tsui! No, no! Shek Tong Tsui! Shek Tong Tsui! Shek Tong Tsui! Shek Tong Tsui! Put out the fire! Shek Tong Tsui! Shek Tong Tsui! Shek Tong Tsui! Shek Tong Tsui! What do you mean? I don't understand you. Coco! These idiots. Does it hurt? Okay. Do you want to finish up? No problem. Let's go. What do you want? - Come on, come here. - Act normal. What's this? You're pretending to be the leader of the triad wearing sunglasses? No.. But no one bothers us. Hey, why do you look so down? Shek Kip Mei, what is it? How dare you ask me that? What happened to you? They beat me when I protected you yesterday! You're not happy? Look, you got into trouble when the boss wasn't there. It's hard to be a boss. Where have you been? Why didn't you hide when they hit you? Thankfully, Coco fought for us. Imagine how I would look. Of course, we wouldn't hire her if she was useless. Exactly. I have you to blame! Hey man, where's the stop at? "The stop"? Of course, there's a lot of them. Do you have any money? Yes, yes. Bro.. Don't you kids go to school? And yet we keep doing all these evil things? Why? Here. Thank you. There it is. Don't move! Don't touch me! Why me? Let's go. Don't move! Or I'll kill you! Don't move! Did you hear me? Don't move! Don't move! You're good at this. Drive. Put on your seatbelt. Why didn't you take me to the police station? We'll take you there when we're done eating. Eat more meat. The soup is really good. It's your favorite. I haven't eaten anything yet. Are you the older sister or the younger one? Don't kid yourself, ma'am. I'm sorry, I lied to you. I don't have brothers or sisters. Just arrest me! Quit messing around. I didn't charge you with car theft. You can be of great help. Same thing, either way. Protecting her.. ..What kind of relationship do you have with her? There is no relationship between her and me.. ..But there is one thing that makes us similar. And that's that we hate most of these filthy couples. I remember when I was 15 years old.. I killed two people. Have you seen my rap sheet? Now it won't be like last time.. I'll set you free if you do as I say. Because you're so close to her.. You will become her scapegoat. The police are offering $1 million dollars for armed robbers Tai Po Rda and Twun Tonga, who robbed a rare gold shop. The police are also looking for the leader of these theives, 31 year old Yie Chi Liang. They robbed Kwun Tong in June, they robbed him with an AK47 automatic rifle. They also robbed Shum Shui Poa. The police and thieves fired a total of 67 shots. This afternoon at a restaurant in TST, (note: *the Tsim Sha Tsui district*) the sergeant Chiang Siu Chi had an argument with a woman, and the sergeant was wounded in the neck by a sharp object and bled to death. Police are now looking for the woman to help them in the investigation. This news bulletin is over. You're causing me problems! That cop is mentally ill! She killed her friend with a knife! And said that I was the killer! She just wants to force you to turn me in. So she really loved Wilson? I'm not interested in hearing about a confused love affair! All I know is I'm out of here. I could die at any moment. I don't want to die! I don't want to die! So then let me go. Come with me to the station. You know who she wants to kill! You're going to leave me out of this! Why? Haven't you always been fair? She could've killed me. But she didn't! Instead, she killed her friend! Did you forget? There are no bullets in this gun. Don't try to be smart! You've caused the death of many people because of her! Why are people so bad? Even friends kill each other! I'm telling you, I've got the kid in my hands. When that woman dies.. I'll release him immediately. You've got to understand.. Hey, that's good. Bye bye. Hey nurse, where's the kid? A man took him away. It was the one who came here with you. He was wearing a hat. I'll check for you, and I can get back to you. Hey. What's going on? What are you doing here? It's nothing.. Upstairs. Do you really have to fight her? I really don't know.. She was my friend. It's a shame to be betrayed by a friend. Do you want to betray me too? It's normal that I betray people for money. I can't believe you would betray a friend. You don't believe it? Even I don't believe it. Hey.. There's someone here. Wait, wait, wait. If we can't capture the woman, we'll beat her up. And if we catch her, we'll split the reward into 5 parts. Why 5 parts? I'm with him. 5 parts is $5,000 less. You don't want to leave a share for Coco, do you? Why should she get paid too? She doesn't even take us seriously. She made a point of separating from us, didn't she? Yes! She doesn't even care about us! We shouldn't care either. Are you finished? I said there would be 5 parts. Come on. Coco, we're all here! That woman’s never gonna get away from us. I wouldn't betray you. Why did you do this? Don't run, idiot! Stop running! Don't come any closer. We came here to get the woman as a reward. If you came to get her, you'll have to catch me too. Coco, you're our boss. Why are you protecting this woman? Come here. We shouldn't take her as a reward. I need to trade her for my son! We can go with you if you want to save your son. That's right! When we save your son, we'll get the reward. Alright? I won't let you do this! Okay, you're the boss. Let's go. Do we really have to go? Yes, we do. Let's go. Assholes! They don’t think about anything but money. Stop! Coco.. Coco! Coco! Coco! Coco.. - Coco.. - Sau Mau Ping?! Sau Mau Ping?! Sau Mau Ping! Ma On Shane! Sau Mau Ping! Sau Mau Ping! Coco, your hat.. Sau Mau Ping! Sau Mau Ping!! Stay back, I have a gun! Mano Boy, don't come any closer! I'll kill you if you come any closer! I'll kill you if you come any closer! Don't shoot! Don't kill me! Get up! Get up! No! Please, call an ambulance! No, no.. Let me wrap your wound. Wrapped or not, it doesn't matter. It hurts? It hurts more than labor pains. Did something happen to Gingin? That's my problem, I don't need anyone's help. I don't want anything to do with you anymore. My problems will continue if you don't go away. I only have one life! Don't bother me anymore, okay? Your godfather has arranged for you to escape Hong Kong. Only then would that woman stop. Alright.. But before I go, I’d like to see Gingin. I won’t let you see him again! That idiot was obviously making a fool of me. Hello? I know who you are. You know I'll find you. Nobody.. ..besides you knows my number. May, are you aware.. ..that you no longer have any friends? Let's cut to the case. I know you're worried about Coco's son. Tomorrow I'll be waiting for you with the boy at Yau Tong's depot. I think we should just get this over with between us. How do you know I'll go? He'll die if you don't go. If you go, one of us must die. Where is my son?! May, I'm here. Leave Coco and her son out of this! You have no right to ask that. I will decide. Don't pretend to be a great woman, because then I feel even worse. Where are you hiding my son?! I trapped him in a box. I also put a time bomb in it. Mommy! Save me! Mommy! No!! Mommy, save me Mommy! No!! Gingin! Mommy, save me Mommy! Mommy, save me Mommy! Mommy! You want to go outside for help? You've gone too far, May! Why don't you just give up? My beloved "husband" is already dead. Nothing else makes sense to me now. Go save Gingin! Where are you? Gingin! Gingin! Gingin, where are you? Gingin! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! - Mommy? - Gingin! Mommy.. Mommy.. I'm really scared. Don't be scared. Wan Chin, the bomb is on him! What should I do? The bomb will go off in one minute! You have to disarm the bomb! I don't know how! Cut the yellow wire first. Everything is alright, Gingin. Be good Gingin and hide. Gingin! I'm here, Mommy! Are you still calling her Mom? One is your real mother, and the other is fake. Gingin, come here. Mommy! How are you feeling? Are you okay? Don't scare me. Gingin.. Can you call me Mom again? Mommy!
