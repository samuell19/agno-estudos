Fasten your seatbelt, I said. OK, have we arrived already? I cleaned the carburetor just yesterday. Dad, why do you drive this hearse? Fine, I'll take the train. How about some money? It's... Her birthday was last month! We have more than one teacher. In a metaphysical sense... emigration for... many Russian poets became a fantasy... a life... after death... that poetry started sounding so piercing, so desperate. Return nothing... Why bring it back? We can no longer love or forgive... We'll never learn to forget... Other countries sleep peacefully and sweetly... The waves lap evenly... Spring comes... In this world in which we... are tormented. Good, our lecture is finished. You're free to go. Excuse me! What's wrong? Can you hear me? Jesus! Have you always had low blood pressure? I don't know, I don't check. Young people can afford not to check. May I take my... 37.2... Well, you'll live. - There's no wheezing in the lungs. - Give her hot tea, let her sleep. Call me if you need me. Good, thank you. - Allow me. - OK. - Oh... - Your back again? Er... Yes, my back went again today... Sasha, come to the clinic this week - for a checkup. - Oh... - OK? Good. - Say hi to your wife and son. - Thanks. Bye... We'll be in touch. I love books. A man gives the best part of himself to books... and the worst part to his life. Tolstoy said that, I think. The poet tears the best from his life... so his writing is glorious, but his life is wretched. Yes... Exactly. Wow... so you're a writer? Hardly. Every writer has a reader, except me. Hi. Good morning... This is my daughter... this is... Anna. - Yes... - I'm coming out. Katya's here. I'm leaving. Good. Your decor is funny. It's a bit eclectic. It's the work of my... ex-wife. She's a designer. I see... I guess it's time for me to go. I don't want to impose. Thank you for everything. You make delicious coffee. Where will you go now? I don't know. Do you have... A mother or husband? No. I have nobody. Excuse me. - Alexander Petrovich. - Hello, Emma Sergeevna. - Hello. - Tea, coffee? No, I'll be quick. Alexander Petrovich, can you imagine what I've had to do? - I'm selling my father's book collection. - Take a seat. What else can I do? It's hard for an old woman... to survive. Like taxi drivers... they want so much money! Here. Take a look please. "Brawler's Poems". Lvovich offered me 100,000. But... as they say, trust, but check first. Right. Berlin, 1923. So... It's not on the antique book market. Did you know it was banned in Russia straight after its publication? No. The entire print run was almost destroyed. Which, by the way, you can't find... in any other book. Hm... I'm sure your book is... twice as expensive. Oh God! Sorry, but I think it's more than that. On page 20 there are... notes by the author. I know Esenin's handwriting well. Any expert would confirm it's his. Right. And the inscription on the title page: "To Sandro with love". That's what Esenin called his friend... - Oh! - Indeed. So you can ask for... 400,000 for this book. Ah! Jesus! Your daughter has grown... do I owe you? Emma Sergeevna... I don't take money from old friends. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, my taxi is waiting for me! I've got to rush. Thank you so much. - Bye. - Alexander Petrovich, you're... marvelous! Forgive me, I... interrupted you, Alexander Petrovich. On the contrary... you saved me from a professional mistake. Anyway... can I thank you somehow? Now I really have to go. Goodbye. Where will you go? I don't know. I'll try to find a house, work... and I'll live a normal human life. Look... you know your literature! I guess you know computers too? Yes. Perfect! I was just looking for an assistant... to sort out all this... trash, and catalog it. Sort the wheat from the chaff... as they say. I'll pay you, of course. You can... look for a job and... a house for as long as you like. What do you think? Georgiy Ivanov, "Gardens"... St. Petersburg... Petropolis, 1921. Abraam Efros... "Erotic Sonnets"? "Erotic Sonnets"... Moscow... 1922. Ah... oops... Ah... Careful! Ouch. What is it? Are you OK? - Well... when you touched me... - the pain went away. Dad, can I see you a second? One moment. Yes... what happened? I don't understand... this redhead, did she register here? Her name's Anna... she's helping me catalog my library. Hm... I understand. - What time is your flight tomorrow? - 1:20 p.m. Right, so we'll leave by 10. Don't worry, we'll take Katya's car. - Are you ready? - Yes. Give it to me. - Have you got your cellphone and charger? - Yes. Yes... We're coming. - Hello... Alexander Petrovich. - Hello, Katya. Hm... Please... I'll close it. - Where will you leave the car? - At the airport... in the parking lot. I see... OK, bye, Dad. - Call me when you get there... without fail. - OK. Well... I started reading and got carried away, sorry. My unfinished novel. It's messy and incoherent. Not at all. It's beautiful writing! Why did you stop? It all rested on the heroine, Nina. I mean... er. I feel that she's badly written. I've probably lived alone... don't understand the female psyche. Well, I'll... understand it. I want you to finish it. It's not easy. I'll help you. And here... in the dialogue. What's wrong with it? Your men and women speak in exactly the same way... it's not right. For a man, words are information... but for a woman, words are something like... music. For a woman, intonation and sound are more important than meaning. Understand? That's enough for today. Let's celebrate our project. With pleasure. Good wine... - It's almost 20 years old. - Wow! I was given it... by a Frenchman... He translated... Alexander Blok. Can you imagine? I really can't imagine Blok in French verse. Honestly, I can't either. His translations. What if I had taken another route... that day? And hadn't noticed you? I don't know. Probably be dead by now. It's scary to think about. You know... glad you took that route. The whims... a beautiful girl... at the end of my life. I'd like to go back 20 years. I'd offer you my hand and heart. Why don't you? In spirit. The age difference doesn't frighten me at all. Really? Friends! When Sasha found Anna... I lost... Yes, because love... is... the best cure for all... and makes us... Hm... [So, let's... raise our glasses... To love. Son. What an interesting signet ring. It's interesting. You know... I'd pay good money for it. - It's not for sale. - Really? Dear, don't listen... He'd rip off his own mother. Ha! That's not true. I always pay people enough... to satisfy them. Well, Emma Sergeevna was... satisfied when we told her the real price of... her Esenin book. You never did know how to do business. Edik, don't be angry. - Sasha, we're out of wine again. - Yes, yes, I promised. I'll get some. You know, when Sasha told me he was getting married, I expected... some highbrow elderly lady. Are fresh as a lily. Amazing! In one phrase, you manage to combine both a compliment and... sorry. I didn't mean to offend. I'm just trying to understand... what motivates a young, beautiful... the wine. Sasha. Oh! Hello, Masha. Hi, Masha! Hi guys! What's the party for? For me, I hope? Welcome home, darling. Some big news... for you... Anna and I... are getting married. Masha. Excuse me. Ah... - Let's drink! - Yes, to love. To love! To the young! Masha... Masha... I understand... that for you... it's all a bit unexpected. A bit? This house is mine too. I live here too. Don't I get a say? Forgive me. I thought you'd be happy for me. Why should I be... rat seduced you? Why the insults? You don't know her at all. Are you sure you know her? Into bed with you... so what? Why get married... Masha, it's not like that at all. She's a fine, delicate... I didn't think it was possible, but it... happened... and... I fell in love with her. Dad, are you crazy? How old are you? Sixty? What about her? What love?! Anna loves me too. The only thing she loves is our house and money. You mean there's nothing else lovable about me? I get it. At least try to be polite to Anna. That's all I ask. And please... come downstairs. Everyone wants to see you. Good morning. Don't try to win me over. I know exactly what you want from this marriage. What? To be a widow ASAP. Masha, please... turn off that noise. I'm working. OK, Dad. We're not getting along so well. I think she needs time to get used to it. Oh dear! That's bad luck. The inheritance will be split... What? I'm not sharing anything with her. - You'll have to... - The law is the law. If I were you, I'd do everything to... That's easy to say. OK, chill out. You can dig up dirt on anyone. Can you get her surname, date of birth, passport number? Well... probably. I know a guy in the police. I'll ask him to find out who she really is. Masha? What're you doing here? I'm looking for mom's blanket, I'm cold. This one? Yes, thanks. Good morning. Hi. Coffee? Go on. I can only give a little bit to a minor. - Sure, Dad... - alcohol is bad at my age. My darling... we're going through what I would call a difficult period. But I'm sure we'll cope... and learn... Yes, Masha? - Sure, Dad. - If you want, I can call her "mom". Masha... stop clowning around. Then... to your happiness. - Yes. - Hi! I've got something on your stepmom. - What? - Not on the phone. But that photo's not her. But her passport number, her full name... are the same. So what does that mean? Your stepmom has someone else's papers... with a fake photo. Dad, don't get mad, alright? Take a look. You see? The real Anna Petrova... has been dead for two years. Who is... this woman in our house? We don't even know. I don't believe it. Into finding the grave of someone... Are you really so obsessed with her?! Dad, she's got a stolen passport. The woman with her details... is dead. Doesn't it freak you out? I won't listen to this nonsense... you were jealous. But now I think you just can't accept that I'm happy... another woman and have children. What?! You want a baby from her?! Why not? That's the point of marriage. But I'm full of strength... and I'm ready... to take responsibility. Dad, she's a gold-digger. What babies?! So... Masha... I'm going... to Petersburg... I'm lecturing there. I'll be back in a few days. We'll talk then. Act nicely. Call me when you're there. Of course, my dear. I'll miss you. I'll be back soon. What if she really has a baby? I don't know... should I poison her? Why? There are professionals for these things. - What? - Are you serious? Yeah. After all, Anna doesn't officially exist. Do you know any? Basically... I know an expert. For 300,000... I'll arrange a meeting. 300? Should I sell my kidney? Well, I don't know. You know, you have to decide on your... priorities. So you think... you can just come here... with a stolen book? I know you need it. Why complicate things? What if your dad finds out? He won't notice. And your new mom? You don't really love her, do you? You buying the book or not? Six... 297, 298... 299. 300. Wow... 300,000 for some book. Some people are idiots. I'd rather... You just aren't... This is Masha... this is Roger. Get out... take a walk. OK. Katya said you wanted someone taken care of. Here's 300,000. Well... tell me about your target. You hungry? Shall I warm up dinner? Dad isn't here, so you don't have to pretend. I... know everything about you. You're not who you say you are. But not for long. You shouldn't have done that. Masha, open the door. You'll have to come out sooner or later. In saecula saeculorum, -... for ever and ever. - Hm... - Quite... a rare symbol. Where did you get it? Oh well... This is... the stamp on a ring that a client brought. Can estimate the age, but... what does this symbol mean... Ouroboros, Venus. - I think it's something like... - a self-resurrecting female. I'm not quite sure... there's a myth that this sect existed... Is that true? Legend, the sect consisted exclusively of women... had the ability to control the flow of vital energy. Life energy? People have called it different things: prana... and so on. So, these... women could take energy from people... so-called... or gave it to others... prolonging their lives for several centuries. Really! The gift was passed down through the maternal line. And... sect rules didn't allow... relationships with ordinary mortals. He or she cannot help giving energy... meeting men was only allowed for the purpose of having babies. Newborn boys to foster parents... but kept newborn girls in the family. Smells like female chauvinism. They had a rather cruel ritual. The father's entire life energy was given to the newborn girl. The newborn girl obtained the gift of immortality. And what happened to the father... when all his energy had gone? He died. Morning! Major Ignatov... CID. Got a minute? Please try to recall. This person? No... Who is it? His body was found... We're interviewing the locals. Hello. Good morning... CID. Tell me, do you know this person? No... I don't know this face. Where were you yesterday between 1 and 7pm? We were both at home all day. OK... sorry to bother you. But if you hear anything, call me. Uh-huh... Sure. - All the best. - Goodbye. Let's go. Calm down... Everyone makes mistakes in life. Just don't say anything to your dad. OK. This stays... between us. We should wash out the blood. It's no use! I know. Open the door. Why didn't you answer the phone? My phone ran out of battery I called you so many times. - Are you alone? - Mm... Yes. - Is that her? - Uh-huh... Uh-huh. Come on, come here. I don't understand. Why are you so happy? Know Roger's dead? Yes. Why? But I don't know why! His body had no signs of violence. Or was on something. He wasn't on anything! He was healthy as a horse, and now he's dead. But your stepmom is alive. - I don't get it. - You suspect me? I don't even know what happened to your Roger. His corpse was found near your house! Is that a coincidence? You know what?! What?! I'm the one who lost 300,000! I'm the victim here! If my dad finds out... you know what he'll do? Come on, calm down. Do me a favor, if the cops come, don't mention me. Don't worry about it. Alexander Petrovich is back this evening. That's great! How about... Masha? Masha's at school. I came... to see you. Believe me, it was... very difficult to decide to do this. Sasha's my friend, but... as soon as I saw you... since then... I can't think about anything else. For some reason I think you need something different. It's very sudden for me too, but... maybe we could just meet up? Go to a... restaurant... have a chat. You know... you should ask my husband. I can't decide that myself. Is anyone... Dad! How have you been? Everything's great. Really? All is well? Yes... we got along fine.. Uh-huh. - Really, Masha? - Sure! We even decided to redecorate. Wow! And the publisher... called me. He's delighted... with our novel, he's going to publish it! - Hurray! - Ha ha ha... I expected nothing less. Any questions? Yes, please. Your novel is open-ended. Will you write... Eh... Perhaps... but let's not predict the future. Switch on the camera! TV program "Women's Secrets". The reason behind the success of your new novel? The reason for my success... Like many writers, I found my muse... my love... – it's my wife. I'd never have written this novel without Anna. Camera! How are you, Anna? Tell us please, are you the prototype for the main character? Anna, why are you so modest? I think... the main character is a collective female image. But I hope our love was a source of inspiration. Anna, what's wrong? What happened? Are you ill? I think I'm... pregnant. This is so... This is wonderful. Masha, open the door! Hi. Who are you looking for? Hello, my lovely child. Is Anna at home? No... she isn't. Dad! Excuse me, who are you? I'm Anna's aunt... her mom's sister. Her flesh and blood, so to speak. I saw you on TV... and I thought: I must get to know her husband... a real life writer. Really? Interesting. Tea, coffee? Yes please. Whisky, please... or brandy. No need to dilute it. Anna, such a cheeky girl, says to me: "Auntie, why did you teach me... to walk and talk, then tell me to sit still and silent?" Oh... Anna is here. Hello, dear! We meet. Aunt, what brings you here? TV's a modern miracle. I left as soon as I saw you. You shouldn't have worried. Why not? Your mom and I haven't seen you for 100 years. We were worried. Then I heard you were married. And even expecting. I was just about to call mom. Why call when you can visit? We'll go see her right now. I'm not going anywhere right now. Don't you feel sorry for your own... mother? She can't wait... Excuse me... but my wife doesn't want to go anywhere right now. Oh... Alexander Petrovich... your nose is bleeding. Excuse me. I hope we understand each other? You told me you had no relatives. Right. Because I didn't want anything in common... I still don't. Your aunt seemed funny to me. If her insanity seems funny... I can't imagine what... you'd say... about the rest of the family. Nobody's forcing you to talk to them. But why didn't you tell me? Please... let's talk about this another time. OK? Agreed? How about that? Good day. Some tea? No, thanks. I'm glad you came. - Mom's waiting for you. - OK. We thought you were dead. You know the reason for my absence. What you... did to my friend... It was your own fault. There's nothing more important than family. But you... let him get too close to you. You endangered us all. The family rules are inviolate: we are bound by blood... and mystery. Anyone who finds out our secret... my dear... must die. Mom, I would never have revealed myself to him. He could guess himself. If not now... then in... ten... twenty years. But the worst thing is... you're repeating your mistakes. This time is different. Do you really think I'd betray you? I'm sorry. But, knowing you... anything is possible. I heard you're pregnant? This is very good news. We haven't had children for 40 years. What will you call her? I'm not sure it's a girl. I am, it's a she. I know. And she will become one... of us. As you wish, mom. Go. And take care of yourself. We'll keep... an eye on you. What're you doing here? Hey?! Who on earth are you? Good morning, dearest. Alexander Petrovich, I was just about to introduce Alexandra to you... your housekeeper. Thanks, but we don't need... We've never had any servants. - Well now you do... - Hmm... Dearest, don't forget - life is not the same as before. - Ah... - Anna needs care... But Masha and me, we can... tidy... the main thing - she's quiet. So, my dearest, don't be like that! Besides, it's already been paid for. - But... - Please... I don't like it. Well, it makes sense... we have the same name. Mmm... Do you know... You don't like her? It's not that. I don't get why she tells dad what to do. She comes whenever she wants... And you don't do anything. Can you keep a secret? What is it? Listen to me... carefully. Heh... You again? Yes. Sorry, but we have nothing to discuss. - This time... - we have to talk. I know... Sasha is lecturing. Have a seat. Here... take a look. - Look, look. - I think you'll be interested. Wow! This is you... at the Stray Dog Cabaret. In 1913, in fact. The 1950s... hm... Oh! You liked rock, too? Me too... I was a fan. Yes, the years go by, the times change. Ah... but you haven't changed... you're still beautiful. First you declare your love... you bring photos of some women. Are you... out of your mind? You know I'm your friend's wife? And I'm expecting... My congratulations! Let me guess: have you got a girl in there? Does... Sasha know the fate that awaits him? Well, well. He doesn't know that either... Masha... sold me... a book from his library... and I paid her 300,000... for it. I wonder why she suddenly needed such a sum? - I don't understand... - What do you want from me? I... just... really love life. Teach me to live forever. Share your secret. I swear... I swear I won't tell anyone! I'll do anything... anything... you want. I'll give you everything! All I have! Well, well. I'll think about your... I hope this will stay between us? I swear on my life... on... my mother's grave. Well hello, my young friend. Oh God! Even the interior has been restored. I haven't been in a Cadillac de Ville... for 100 years. Don't be silly, in '69 in the States... I get it... I didn't want to harm anyone. Don't worry so much. I'm gonna kiss you... and everything will pass. Masha, dear... hurry up! We're already late. - Where are your flowers? - Ah, yes... I forgot. - Oh! - Aah... You're just in time. We're going to... My dear, don't worry so much! Anna's already... us to bring you there. So we can all meet... at last. As family, so to speak. She didn't say anything to me. She entrusted this to me. Let's go. The car's waiting. Oh well. And you, dear... you'd better stay here. Please get in. Thanks. - Have you already seen... - my daughter? Excuse me... but where are we going? Want some whisky? No, thank you. My dear, come into the house. Make yourself at home! Almost everyone's here already. Your coat please. - I'm sorry? - Take off your coat. Oh yes. Give me the flowers. Mom... let me introduce you. Nice to meet you. You're so... young-looking. Where's our... little girl? Have you chosen a name? I'd like to name her after you. In our family... who gives names. Why are you all so sad? After all, today our family has grown! Let's drink... To the newborn. What are you waiting for? Kiss each other! Flesh for flesh and a life for immortality. Flesh for flesh and a life for immortality. - Masha... - Oh! - Ugh, you scared me! - Take her. - Wait in the car. - Uh-huh. Don't stop the engine, OK? Uh-huh. - Where am I? - Run, run! Hurry! Quickly! Farewell... my sister. Dad, I told you a hundred times, buy a new car! Look, is it OK? No... it needs to be higher up. As straight as possible. There... that's so great! Dad! What? We'll ask now. Well, do you like it? Wow... You're so clever! Let's decorate... Dinner's ready, come on up. All good, I'm revising for exams. I'm very glad you came... We put up garlands and a wreath... me and dad are gonna decorate the Christmas tree after dinner! You're such a good girl. Can you help me... set the table? - Sure! - Run and wash your hands. Masha, let's set... - the table! - OK, let's go. Do you still love me? Of course I do. And I'll love you... for ever and ever.
