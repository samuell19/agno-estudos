Does love happen by chance or choice? Amid a plethora of chances and choices, love finds its way toward us. Nice art, right? He's a genius. Of course, we have no idea if that love will be good or bad. A picture? Why didn't you say so? Should I stand here? Go on, take it. As this semester comes to an end, what kind of love did you find? What? Did he just blow me off? Jae Young! Congratulations! And what kind of love are you seeking? Congrats on your graduation! Quick! Let's take a picture! I'm going to make a funny face. - Yoo Na, look at the camera. - You call that funny? Be quiet, dumbass! You look so ugly. Hyung Tak! Get over here for a picture! This isn't the time for pictures. - Why not? - Look at this. What is it? - That slide design sucks. - Take a closer look! It's about you! Me? Integrity. - Academic Integrity course? - All freeriders are getting an F. Doesn't that mean you can't graduate? Give me that. Here's my take on yesterday's epic Integrity presentation. Bad news for expecting graduates. Justice prevails! In order to learn from our past graduates and re-establish a proper integrity standard at Hanguk University, I believe it's important to be honest and fair. First of all, I'd never seen a crappier PowerPoint presentation before. I'm Choo Sang Woo, and this concludes my presentation. Second, I was shocked to see he took out the names of his freeriding teammates. And that's not all... Choo Sang Woo. The professor asked if he was certain his teammates didn't participate. One person said he was homesick. Another said his grandaunt passed away. They're guilty as hell. What he said next was just epic. If a student doesn't have to participate and is allowed to fake attendance just because he's graduating soon, isn't that unfair to diligent students? Justice is served! Right? Those teammates are doomed. 221 Computer Engineering Yeah, I'm here. I'll try to change his mind and take him to the professor. Choo Sang Woo? I heard he only wears plaid shirts. Damn, I don't see him. I'm sorry. I was busy. Could we meet up and talk? He ignored it again. He sure is giving me a hard time. Yeah. I'll do whatever he wants. You worry about yourself. Sang Woo! Could we talk? - Who are you? - You know who, come on. Choo Sang Woo, right? - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. You're Choo Sang Woo. Choo Sang Woo? Hey, Sang Woo. You're not him? Sang Woo. What the... Hey! Is this a dress code or something? Are these your uniforms? - This is crazy. - What are you talking about? Looking for Choo Sang Woo? - Is he in there? - No. He was the first to submit his answers and leave. Already? But I came here 20 minutes ago! Free 1: Why'd you remove my name? My grandmother passed away. Free 2: I got an F. You happy now? Free 3: Thanks, I can't graduate. We need a talk. Freerider 3 You just won't give up. Over here! You're early. We're moving on to map designing, right? Yeah. But the thing is... Oh, I'm sorry! I suddenly got employed, so I can't do our project anymore. I'm so sorry! I had no idea this would happen. They want me to join their workshop starting tomorrow. That's very sudden. We had this all planned out. Instead, I'll introduce you to talented designers. I'll get you their portfolios. You went to the festival. Did you see anything you like? Then, is this designer available? Jang Jae Young? He's going to the U.S. to study soon. I don't think he's available. Do you have anyone else on your mind? That's okay. Thanks for all your help. Yeah, same here. But wait! We're done? Is there anything else? Well, no. But I still feel sorry. Then let me buy you dinner. Do you have time? It's okay. All right. Bye! There goes Choo Sang Woo. He's as cold as ice! Computer engineering junior. Top student for all three years. He doesn't do any activities. He's not even in the group chat. He's not in any clubs, either. Is he from Mars or something? I know. Doesn't it feel like ages since we talked to him? I can't remember his voice. Give up trying to look for him. He'll give you a splitting headache. That makes me want to find him more. You're kind of a freak yourself. Yeah. - So much effort went into this drawing. - It's a waste of good talent. Choo Sang Woo. Are you playing tag with me? He's getting me riled up. Game name. Platform. Genre. Analysis. Modes. Features. You know who Choo Sang Woo is? Oh, I heard about him. I heard Jae Young can't graduate because of him. Jae Young is obsessed with finding him. He swears he'll make him pay for it. You got any info on him? I heard he's famous in engineering. How should I know? There are so many engineering majors. - You don't know him? - No. But I heard he's really famous. Choo Sang Woo Make me pay? Yeah, right. Hi. I see you picked the same drink as usual. I'm Ryu Ji Hye. Computer engineering. I borrowed some coins from you here. Do you remember me? You're... the 800 won. 800 won isn't my name. That's fine. I'm sure we'll get to know each other better. Here. I don't have change for that, though. That's fine. I'll give you the change later. Oh, wait! Is this you? It looks like you. Even the hat looks the same. It was all over the lecture hall. Choo Sang Woo. Age 23. Computer Engineering junior. Enrolled back in September after military service. No clubs or activities. Sang Woo, come see me before I change my mind. And blocking my number won't work. He sniffs around and even threatens me? You want me to call that number? I think he blocked my number. What did you expect? I would've hid too if I got a crazy text like that. I'm hungry! This better be the last house we look at! You're dead if you don't help me with my graduation project. I'd rather sleep on the street than in that tiny place we looked at. You think the size is the problem? What about your furniture? So what? It's only six months. Unbelievable. I knew this would happen when you gave your furniture to that tenant for free. Choi Yoo Na. If I ever freeze to death on the street, bury Choo Sang Woo next to me so I can see him on my death bed. - Yeah, please die then. - Okay. - I'm sick and tired of Choo Sang Woo. - Over here. Okay. Hey, let's go. Just a sec. We hearby inform you, Jang Jae Young, that your graduation has been canceled. - You're drinking too fast. - Don't bother. He wants to die. - Who wants to die? - Oh my! Sorry I'm late. I was happy that Soo Young got employed, but you look dead tired! You guys, don't graduate! Stay in school as long as you can. Oh, yeah. I heard your graduation got canceled. Sorry! Are you teasing me? Look, you might as well have fun for half a semester! Yeah! You're talented enough to go abroad to study anytime you want. So live it up before you go! Live it up! And it would be perfect if you took over my project while you're at it. Right? No way. Come on, the developer picked your design. He said yours is the only one he likes. What are friends for? Please? He certainly has an eye for design. What is he, a computer engineering major? There he goes again. Yeah, he doesn't talk much but he's smart and driven. And he's the top student. What's his name? Choo Sang Woo. Choo Sang Woo? Choo Sang Woo? Yeah. He's scaring me. Okay. Where can I see him? Action Running Game - Veggie Man Choo Sang Woo The designer you mentioned is available, so I told him when and where to meet you. Why isn't he here? It's time. No untimely person is ever decent. Are you the designer? Yes. Are you Choo Sang Woo? You're late. You're better-looking than I thought. Do you know my name? Yes. But it doesn't ring a bell? Is that important? Aren't you here to talk about the game? I am. I'm here for the game. Can I see that? Veggie Man... I heard you're a genius coder. But this isn't too impressive. The characters look drab and the story is boring. There's nothing special about this. And you think this will be enough? Have you worked on a mobile game before? No. I'll look for another designer. Are you really going to kill him? Who do you take me for? Then what? I just wanted to see who he was. And if I like what I see, I'll play along for a bit. Is this good enough? You're not very reliable, but you sure do have talent. That's a compliment, right? Give me your number. Freerider 3 No wonder you didn't know. Freerider 3 You already have my number. What? That can't be... Team Leader We meet at last. Sang Woo. Did you enjoy ghosting me? I guess the game was an excuse and you came for something else. A bit of both. We can make up and work on a game together. Nice, no? I don't think so. I never crossed you to begin with. But you seem to be very bitter about the group project. Easy there, tiger. Don't lash out at me. I'm not here to pick a fight. Relax. I don't trust people who sniff around. I think I'm done here. In case you forgot, you're the one who asked to see me. My drawings... I heard that you like them. I did. But that was before I knew you were Freerider 3. We won't be working together, so don't contact me. No can do. It wasn't easy to find you. It'd be a shame to let you go. So here's the deal. "I'm very sorry you can't graduate on time because of me." Say it. Then I might leave you alone. Only if you fix two errors. First, the reason you can't graduate on time isn't because of me, but because of your own choices. Second, I'm not sorry at all. So all I can say is, "You didn't graduate on time." Hey. You really are a freak, aren't you? Who's calling who a freak? Look. Is there anything you hate? You. How about a color? Red? What's it to you? Any place you hate? Anywhere within ten meters of you. So... Sang Woo. I was willing to let it slide. But I changed my mind. Look forward to it. Recruiting game designer You need a designer, too? So do I. Here, your change. You kept these in your pocket just to give them to me? Since I didn't know when I'd see you. Hey... Could I have your number? What for? I just thought it'd be nice to text you from time to time. And we could share information when we find a good designer. Okay. I'm exhausted. I can't lift my arms anymore. Look at this... Did you see my arm? Stop whining. Move it! This place is pretty big. Stop getting in the way! All right, all right. I brought you a gift. Nice. I thought you hated this place. You changed your mind? It's not so bad. And there's an unexpected surprise. What you got there? Let me see. Let's eat. - How about jajangmyeon? - Yeah! - With tangsuyuk! - And a bottle of kaoliang? - Even better! - That's what I'm talking about! Big school event: D-3 Order it now! - I like to pour the sauce. - No way! You should dip it. Get up: 8:30 AM First Day of School Exercise: 8:45 AM Brush teeth: 8:58 AM Ready for school: 9:16 AM Huh? Move your boxes! - Unit 212 Going to school delayed by 2 minutes: 9:20 AM Purchase Black Holic: 9:25 AM That's odd... Black Holic: Sold out What is this fool up to? What am I going to do with all these? Starting the first day on the wrong foot. Failed to get third seat by the window I came here 30 minutes early, as planned. Whose is this? Mine. I didn't know you were taking this class. - Lee Suk Hoon. - Here. - Lee Han Dong. - Here. - Lee Hoon Gee. - Here. Jang Jae Young. Here. You're a visual design major. - Can you keep up with this class? - Certainly, Professor. I'm very interested in engineering. Is that so? I believe that a merge between art and engineering is the future. Very well then! Next... Choo Sang Woo Bug spotted! Attack head-on Bug Algorithm A Attack head-on The bug fights back! 4 sting combos Waste of time Attack head-on = Waste of time Bug Algorithm B Ignore the bug Bug loses interest Natural termination Ignore bug = Problem solved Ignore the bug Hi, it's Ji Hye who asked for your number! Did you find a designer? He's not replying. Forget it. It'll take more than ransomware to get past his firewall. You mean I'm a virus? I'm just worried about you. This is Choo Sang Woo you're talking about. Have you ever seen him with anyone like... Huh? What's going on? What's that? You want to go over there? Okay. Eat up, Sang Woo. I see you're saving your broccoli. Have mine, too. He's even giving him his food. They must be close! Have these carrots, too. Sang Woo! It's a sin to waste food! Roll call at beginning/end of class Fake attendance will result in an F Thanks to him, I can't even slip out of class. What the heck? You've been wearing that for days! If you're going to wear my hat like that, I want it back! Matching colors are great. They make me stand out! Yeah, that's the problem. They're such an eyesore, damn it. You're right. It's hard to ignore what I'm wearing, isn't it? But I don't get why he seems okay. Maybe he's just pretending. He's being a tease. You mean Choo Sang Woo? Sang Woo said he hates red. And that he hates me the most. Me, too. I hate you the most. I hate you the most. I could've signed up for Mathematics too if it wasn't for this class. What's the rush? How do you know my class schedule? Ta-da! Didn't you drop this for me? Wasting time must be a hobby of yours. But I'm not interested. You've got lots of patience. I'll give you that. He's so childish. Making small talk in French Talk partners: Jang Jae Young, Choo Sang Woo - Did you all say hi to your partners? - Yes. Professor. I find this difficult because I don't like my partner. Could I have someone else? I'm sorry. Overcoming that is also part of teamwork. Teamwork. I see. Trust me. You're in good hands. Is it a crime to wear red clothes? No. J. Soori Mansion Is it a crime to take my favorite seat? No. Is it a crime to buy up the coffee? No. Is it a crime for him to exist at all? No. Lousy laws. I must be seeing things. You scared me! Why did you have to shout? Are you insane? You'll scare the neighbors. I'm reporting you for stalking. What did I do? A fellow student moved in next door. How is that stalking? You expect me to believe that? It doesn't matter what you believe. That's the truth. I was just as surprised as you! But I waited for you to find out. I thought you were trash, but now I think you're a complete psycho. I get that a lot. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you don't bother me at all. That only makes me want to try harder. Then good luck, you psycho. Thanks, you freak. Sang Woo! Gosh, are you sick? No, I'm okay. Your nose is bleeding! Oh no! Are you all right? What's that? Who's that next to Sang Woo? I think it's Ryu Ji Hye. Ryu Ji Hye? It's her, right? From class B? Yeah, I heard she's interested in Sang Woo. I guess they're dating. So he's got time for dating, huh? Why does he drink this? Wow. He doesn't care if the seat is taken? Why are you always wearing a hat? Isn't it uncomfortable? You don't look so bad when you're not frowning. Choo Sang Woo! Dozing off on the first week? Sorry. He's definitely an art student. That error code jerk. Maybe the permanent marker was a bit much. Hey, are you crazy? You erased it clean! That's enough. I'm sick of your childish pranks. Your eyebrows tremble when you're angry. Why are you doing this to me? It's not like this will let you graduate. Graduate? The semester's already started. - Then why... - I have no issues with you. Thanks to you, every day is fun. What do you get from bothering me? Well... It just feels good. Stop bothering me and tell me what you want. What I want... Take it off. Take it off. Your hat. You like being a bully? You think this is fun? You're overreacting over a hat. Didn't you ask me what I wanted? You keep talking crap like that as if it means something. Enough is enough. I won't let you boss me around. You'd better not test my patience. You've got guts. Choo Sang Woo has a temper! He kicked your ass! Yeah. Why'd you ask for his hat? Extortion is a crime. That's not what it was. I just wanted to see his angry face. Wow. You just sounded like a freaking pervert. - Thanks for the compliment. - Thanks for confusing it as a compliment. There they go again. What? Check this out. What is it? That's the scum who made you work your ass off for almost no pay. This guy's a thug. I can't believe he's a mentor! Our school is crazy! I lost five kilograms because of this jerk! Yeah, you used to be cute and chubby. Hey! I told you to throw these cans away. This takes care of the coffee. I have to tie my shoelace, it's loose. Hey. Could you reserve my seat with this bag? Getting up early is a pain in the neck. Hey! You're worse than I am! Yeah, that's why you should look after your own things. Sang Woo! Dream about me tonight. I knew it. He's not here this early. I can sit next to you, right? Did you come up with this idea last night? Mind your own business and focus on class. I'm trying to hype you up about your idea. It crossed over the wall! Could you get it for me? Oh, maybe not. It went over the wall, so maybe it's yours now. He should be eating here... I can't believe he sat at a table full of people. He sat there just to keep me away! Yeah, yeah. I guess he hates your guts. Congratulations. No, that's not the point! He always stuck to his routine no matter what. But now, he does things he's never done because of me. So? Did you hear what I said? Jang Jae Young! What is it that you want? What do I want? Let's say he changed because of you. But why does that matter? You want to go from an awful lunatic to an even worse one? You're being unnecessarily logical today. I just wanted you to know. You look like a kid bothering his crush. Later. No way. This spot is mine. Taken by Jang Jae Young The Art of Revenge I need to increase my attack skills. Aren't you studying too hard? The semester's barely started. Your nose isn't bleeding today. I was so surprised the other day! Thanks for helping me that time. If you're grateful, then talk casually to me. Why would I do that? Because I'm two years younger! And I think it'll be more effective that way. Well, yes. Yes? Yeah. That sounds much friendlier. Jang Jae Young! What is it that you want? Let's say he changed because of you. But why does that matter? What do I really want? Too bad I can't go to that guest lecture. Can I ask you something? Is that your question? No, it's a rhetorical expression meaning I'll ask you a question. Was your nickname Sang Choo as a kid? How'd you know? I knew it. Then can I call you Sang Choo? Fine with me. Choo Sang Choo. Sounds cute. Lettuce? I don't like lettuce. Ji Hye in computer engineering, right? I'm Jang Jae Young, visual design. Hi. I'm a fan of your art! But how did you know me? Well, I know everything about Sang Woo. Are you two close? - Yeah. - Nope. Don't be ridiculous. We're together all day from dusk till dawn. I have to go. Okay. Enjoy the guest lecture! He's no fun. But a guest lecture? What lecture? He's going to that one. Quickst? Who is she? Come on, tell me! I saw you together before. Are you two dating? Leave her alone. She's just a nice person. I never said I was going to bother her. But did you know that Quickst is a piece of crap? I don't care what you think. He's famous for exploiting people. I know lots of victims. That's probably because the people you know are all stupid. Hey, watch it. I guess nobody told you about him because you never listen to anyone. What's that? This is better. It's much more noticeable! This game might be a joke to you, but it's important to me. You're nothing but a crappy scumbag to me. Nothing more, nothing less. So save your breath and buzz off. Doesn't this look fun? I bet you'll give up in three days. Nope! I can be reliable if I have to. Go easy on the darts. You'll punch a hole! Aren't you going to bother Choo Sang Woo today? Don't mention his name. Why not? You couldn't stop talking about him. Oh yeah! Let me introduce you to this girl. She's in your class, Applied Engineering. Applied Engineering? Do you even know what that is? But he's dropping the class next week so she won't matter. Why do you think that? He might stay. Are you nuts? - Just meet her once. - No way, man. Meet her. That's the jerk from Quick. Worst timing ever. That prick is nasty when he's drunk. Why'd he have to come here? Choo Sang Woo? Never mind. Let's drink. You should've prepped my seat first. Don't make me do it myself. You idiot! Idiot! I ought to chop your neck and teach you a lesson, you idiot. When will you learn? A hand chop right on your throat! Pow! Hand chop right there! I'll get going now. Your name is Choo Sang Woo? We still have things to talk about. If you could send me the project contract, I'll read it and think about it. I guess you're too young. You don't know how this world works. If you're given a chance, you should say thank you and accept it! Don't play hard to get. The intellectual property rights need to be discussed further. I'll discuss this with you in the daytime. Finish your drink before you leave. You dare walk out on me, you little...! - Finish your drink! - I knew it. He's so annoying. You want to go someplace else? After I finish this drink. I could drink it, but I don't want to right now. The antisocial ones always say that, don't they? Let go of me. You think you can take me on? You're laughing? That's enough. If you don't stop, I'm calling the cops. Why you little... Oops. My hand must have slipped. - You. - Yes? That's enough. If you don't stop, I might put a hole in your head. What is this? Are you with him? - Yeah. - No. He's with me. What the hell is this? Back off, bozo! Let go of me! Why did you push me? Shut up! Let's go. - How could he do that to me? - Relax! Listen, I didn't follow you today. I just happened to be there, okay? Yeah, I know. What if he calls the cops? He'll be too embarrassed to say an undergrad beat his ass. If he does, he's crazy. I guess he already is though. You don't seem worried at all. Good night. Damn, my bag. The key's in the bag. And my phone's dead. Sang Woo. Can I use your laptop? Who memorizes phone numbers? Let me just DM him. It might be faster to just go back there. What if that jerk is still there? I thought you weren't worried. I'm not. I just... I don't let just anyone in my house. Cold jerk. So damn cold. Ten minutes. Not a minute more. J. Soori Mansion Your place reminds me of you. It's got no warmth. What's this? Get started. You have eight minutes. You're like a talking stopwatch. I have to look up my ID and password. I won't steal anything. I'm not a hacker. Why don't you go wash up? You reek of alcohol. I won't touch a thing! ...I might put a hole in your head. I only get five attempts? Sang Woo! Do you know how to hack? I shouldn't have let him in. You're so drunk! Don't try to be a hero! I'm a firefly. zzang_jae_0_0 sent you a message. Hyung Tak! My bag, my keys! Should I just throw you away? You still haven't found it? I sent a message, but... What are you staring at? You look way better without a hat. Why do you always wear one? It's none of your business. If you're done texting, leave. It's cold outside. Leave now! Cut me some slack. The temperature drops low at night. Would you like it if I coughed next to you in class? You're wearing me out. You should've seen that coming when you let me in. What's this? Behind the arm. Are you hurt? Not me. You. You scared me. Where? I don't see a thing. Ouch! Go easy! I didn't even touch it. I meant, don't be so angry. Then you do it yourself. Don't be like that. I can't even see where it is. Okay. I'll stay still. Do you always do that when you drink? I mean, isn't it tiresome to deal with jerks? Not really. Isn't it a disadvantage to unnecessarily make enemies? I don't care. There were plenty of jerks in my life, and I beat them all. Are you some kind of lone hero? You know, you're the biggest jerk in my life these days. But... I was grateful today. I may hate you, but I can still thank you. Spoken like Choo Sang Woo. Jae Young! Your bag! Come and get your bag! Uh... I have to go. Huh? I must be crazy. Why do I keep thinking about him? What's going on? - What's happening? - Sang Choo! Here! Sang Choo? Hi! - Did you have lunch? - Ryu Ji Hye? What's up with them? Let me know if you see a portfolio you like. I'll gladly help you. Our brainchild is about to die. You save it. Everything was good until he came along! This is because of me? It was fine until yesterday, but suddenly this happened. Maybe that jerk stepped on it. My precious laptop. Can you fix it for me? No? You don't want to? Oh well, never mind. I'll just take it to some junkyard and get overcharged to fix this. Are you crazy? Give it here. You know what? I think the D drive is detached. No way. Yes way! Who said the D drive can't be detached? You erased all my pictures! I had to fix your laptop. My pictures are gone! Why'd you have to do that? Pictures aren't important. Then what is? Tell me. You said you made backups of the important files. I fixed your laptop and formatted it for good measure. Why are you complaining? How could you erase everything? That's cold. Computers are the same as humans. They won't work if you hang onto all sorts of trash. It's ineffecient. All right, smarty pants. It's amazing how you even think like a computer. Why are you teasing me again? I'm not teasing you. I'm starting to understand your thought process. You think I'm some sort of machine? That's not far off. Wait for me! Come on, wait for me! You're going to drop the course, right? Soo Young needs a designer. You interested? - Nope. - What? You're staying in the class? I don't know. Go away! Then... help me with my graduation project. - Get lost. - Damn it. What's that? Personal work? No. I'm just warming up. But you don't ever draw people. Look at those lines! I see lots of affection for the subject. You're right. I wonder why. Whatever. Then I'll tell Soo Young you're not interested. Is there something you hate? You. You know, you're the biggest jerk in my life these days. So, how did your date go with Choo? Was it good? No, it was a complete failure. Everything was good until he came along! Who? Waiting for me? Why? Do I look even better than usual? Red clothes... You noticed already? We have to practice our lines today. So you should remove this. Like this! Like this. We can use paper. Is this the 15th century? Are we scholars? So... Do you have any ideas for the script? Romance. Romance is a bad idea. How about asking for directions to an exchange student? That sounds cliche as hell. It's a good thing I'm not making a game with you. How about two people who confess their love but find out they were half-brothers? - That's messed up. - The professor likes messed up romance stories. I'll think about the plot. You think about some good lines to use. You're going to write the script? Yeah. I'm in the drama club. I sometimes direct, too. What? You thought I would freeride again? Who cares if we have a good script? A robot has more emotions than you. A few hours of practice won't cut it. Isn't good pronunciation enough? Tell me the truth. You've never dated before, have you? Why does that matter? Because you make this sound like a courtroom drama. Have you ever liked someone before? If you mean emotional illusions shown on TV or the media, no. Illusions? Love is just propaganda for the reproduction of humanity. Wow, that sounds extremely prejudiced. I'm just being extremely reasonable. Then, what do you think dating is? The act of seeing each other with the intent of marriage. Sort of like a trial version before the full software. That's for you. I hate the taste, so I'm letting you have it. What are you doing? What? Your new strategy won't work on me, so don't pretend to be friendly. I don't make strategies. I just do whatever I want. I'm off. What's with him? The plot looks normal. What's he up to? Did he poison this? No wonder you're quiet. Even his silence bothers me now. Has he always looked like this? Sang Woo. How long do I have to keep my eyes closed? I did the same childish thing. Shame on you, Choo Sang Woo. Freerider 3 French Pronunciation Video Watch this video and practice the pronunciation. Huh? He's not mad at me? I'll take a look. Put spaces between your words. You sound like my writing professor. Which one is better? Pick one. You'll be wearing it. He's not replying again. I'll have to get him something with lots of frills then. What's with the poop fly on your cheek? Oh, this? A sign that he's fond of me. I want to poke my eyes out. Then here's a sign from me. Do you think this would look good on him? Wait, you don't know what he looks like. Maybe something brighter. - Busy, busy. - Yellow? He has fair skin. - Let go of me! - It's pretty, I mean, it's cute! No, you look okay! I really hate long hair! You look great with long hair! Then why is yours short? Well, this looks better on me. This is a bad idea! You know there's no backing out. But this is too much! I wasn't going to say this, but other teams are even singing and dancing. You sure you can't do this? Did you memorize all the lines? Of course. Write it on your hand if you're nervous. That wouldn't be fair. Right. That's the Sang Woo I know. Sang Woo, look over here. What? Delete it! You want it deleted? Then call me hyung. Go on! You're not even my brother. - Delete it! - The professor's here. - Bonjour! - Is everyone ready? You're still not done? Hold on. It's here somewhere. This is crazy. He's out of his mind. Relax. We only borrowed these. No big deal. No, you stole them! I wouldn't have worn them if I had known. Oh, no! Are you scared? Be quiet. Yeah, it's in the prop box? Should I tell her I'm sorry? Okay, I'll turn it on. Should I, or should I not? Tell me. Tell me. Right, did you buy the movie tickets? You want to go see a movie? Out of Order Damn it. - Lee Gi Ho. - Here. - Lee Suk Hoon. - Here. - Lee Han Dong. - Here. - Lee Eun Bee. - Here. Why'd you suddenly leave? Don't worry about her. I explained everything. Choo Sang Woo. Choo Sang Woo isn't here? Choo Sang Woo is absent. What gives? Don't know. Maybe he's sick. When he had a massive hangover, he still came to class. That's odd. Is he really sick? Freerider 3 Search: Unusual urges Compulsive desires Hey, Choo Sang Woo! Are you alive? Why were you absent? You're not dead, right? Choo Sang Woo! I wish I could format everything. Choo Sang Woo! I know you're in there. Choo Sang Woo! I'm pretty sure he's in there. Hey! What if he's unconscious? Open up, or I'll call the cops! I'm really calling the cops! You look... Why are you disturbing me? I should be the one calling the cops. You could've told me you were sick. Did you see a doctor? I was just checking if you had a fever. Mind your own business and leave before I report you for public disturbance. How can I not worry with you looking like this? Why aren't you answering your phone? Or replying to my texts? I never asked you to be worried! You seemed okay for a while. What's your problem now? Just because we did an act together, doesn't mean we're friends. Nothing's changed and you're still giving me a hard time. You're giving me crap for worrying about you. Sure, I behaved like a freak at first. But that was only three days. After that, I dropped to my knees to make up for it! Right, regardless of how I felt. Wow. I don't even know what to say to that. Honestly, it irritates me even now to look at you. Then I guess you were pissed every time you saw me. All you think about is your damn GPA. - Good for you. - Yeah, so get lost. Don't tell me what to do, you jerk! I've had it with you. Good riddance. Where's Jae Young? Don't know. He's not replying. Why's he pissed? Could we get a soda, please? And a soju, please. I thought you weren't coming. I wish I had tried something. At least I wouldn't have regrets. Is something wrong? Lettuce... Why are you eating lettuce? Don't eat this. Damn Sang Choo! Who told you to eat lettuce, huh? Only eat perilla leaves from now on. You got that? I like lettuce, though. - Are you nuts? - Yeah, you didn't know? I did. - Here you go. - Thank you. You're crazy. You'll get yourself killed. Relax, I won't ask you to carry me home. What the hell is it now? What's going on? Never mind. It's all over now. If you hate me that much, I'll leave you alone. Choo Sang Woo. Recruiting game designer Your puffy eyes are crazy! Can you even see anything? Quit fooling around and go buy me an energy drink. You go get it yourself. Walk off the swelling. We drank all weekend, but how come you're fine? Because it's me. Obviously. Delete 23 photos. You just want the energy drink, right? I appreciate it, sir. Thank you, sir. You didn't insert any coins. Black Holic, right? I was in the mood for coffee, too. What a coincidence. Here. You're so exact. Here, your change. What? It's gone bad? No. It just tastes bad. But the ingredients haven't changed. It tastes the same as always, like watery coffee. Did you wear this inside out? That's cool! I'm going to wear it like that too. What's up? You look tired today. Jang Jae Young looking worried? That's a first. What is it? Girl problems? I'm not like you. So, what do you want this time? Wow! How'd you know I needed something? I need good-looking guys for my restaurant's grand opening. Do you know any handsome guys? Could you post it on your social media? Do you just need a waiter? Really? You really mean it? But it'll be hard as hell. You okay with that? Even better then. I'd rather be busy. He said yes! He said yes! Hell yeah! This feels odd. Everything is back to normal, but... Did he move out? Jang Jae Young A selfie before our act. Why did he upload this without asking? Nothing like skateboarding when it's stressful. These pictures are awful. He looks like a punk. Do I look good? Here I go. Dummy. Before I clean out my art room. I envy you. When are you coming back? Grand Opening. Come see our awesome waiter! It's in Yonseok-dong? That's far. What am I thinking? What have I been doing for two hours? Sang Choo, you want to get some air? Are you concerned about something? You have this blank look on your face. And I saw you sighing in the library earlier. I just... have this problem I can't solve. What is it? Try me. I'm not as smart as you, but people tell me I'm pretty smart. Well... I got rid of the cause of the problem, but it won't return to its normal state. And it lags more than before. Then getting rid of it wasn't the answer. You should rollback and take a look at the problem again. - Rollback? - Yeah. Jae Young! We're having a blind date and you have to join us! They'll let us meet acting majors only if you're there, please! I'm busy. I have to work part-time. - Please, just once! - Please! No way. Move. - Come on, please! - No. - Let go of me. - Please come. I never knew you would take me to a place like this. They all look delicious. What should we have? Anything's fine. You know that's the worst answer. But it's fine. Then I'll order two of what I want. Okay. Could we order? May I take your order? We'll have one pepperoni pizza and... Allow me to explain the menu. This is chicken, and this is... Our snow flower pizza is pretty famous. And what about your drinks? Man, it's busy as hell. Choo Sang Woo? How did he know I was here? This is for table three. I'm going on break. Of course I did well. I'll be right back. But the restroom is this way... Hey, Hyung Tak. Yeah, it's Yonseok-dong. A grand opening gift sounds nice. Come over. No, I'm not busy. Keep talking. Hyung. Hang up the phone. I have something important to say. Hyung. Let's make a game together. You said it irritates you to see me and told me to get lost. And now what? You want us to make a game? Are you kidding me? I need a skilled designer. Like you, hyung. This is nuts. If you just barge in on me and say a few words, am I supposed to say okay? - Hyung, if there's anything... - Stop calling me that! You never said that before, so why now? - Because that's what you wanted! - No. Don't. Forget it. I'm not a damn robot like you with no feelings. I don't want to do a project with you. Enjoy your little date and go home. What took you so long? - Sorry. - I was so busy while you were gone. That table over there, those were your friends, right? Nope. What do you mean? I saw him follow you out the door. Give this to him. What is this? Action Running Game Choo Sang Woo That's his, right? I don't care. Let him come and get it. By the way, that girl who was here, do you know her? Bring her here again. I'll give her free treats! I need a skilled designer! - Like you, hyung. - Stop calling me that! Damn it, don't give me that sad look. You were away for so long, I thought you ran away. The food was delicious but way too expensive, right? Yeah, it wasn't great. It would only look good on social media. - Then let's go to that cafe at... - I need a more reasonable strategy. Strategy? Thanks for coming here today. See you tomorrow at school. What? Wasn't this a date? Damn it. This won't make it go away. I tried everything not to care about him but he's won me over in just two tries. Jang Jae Young, were you this easy? That jerk probably doesn't care about me. Why did he keep this? It's making me weak. How to Understand and Persuade People Why is this book so thick? Hyung, please reconsider my suggestion. Stop calling me that! You never said that before, so why now? - Because that's what you wanted! - No. Don't. But you told me to call you hyung. Jae Young, You think that'll work? What good are these books if you can't win over one person? You were right. I should've been more involved. So I thought about ways to benefit your... Forget it. You left this. Bye. I drink Black Holic. Wait! I need you. It has to be you. So please reconsider. I promise I'll make it work! Hyung. You sure you can finish the project within this semester? Yes. Then I'm changing the project plan because Veggie Man really sucks. Overall Schedule Detailed Schedule I need you to agree to two things. First, you have to meet deadlines. Second, I don't appreciate half-hearted work. If you have no objections, prepare a new project plan until our next meeting. Are you joking? Our next meeting is tomorrow! We're short on time, so we can't allocate much time on planning. Damn. Unless you send it to me by midnight, we're going with this plan. You're what people call a toxic boss. You like this stuff? Only old people eat these. What? You're leaving? There's a reason I can't stay longer. And what's that? I don't want to tell you. And one more thing, don't touch me without letting me know in advance. It makes me very uncomfortable. See you at our next meeting. Just say tomorrow. You make it sound like it's days away. That's up to me. Why are you being so spineless? You had a big fight. Why are you helping him? He said he needs me. He always glared at me, but then he had a sad look on his face and asked me for help. - How could I refuse? - How impressive. I bet it's because he called you hyung once. Not just once, but four times. You're pathetic. Send me the plan by midnight Meet me at the engineering building tomorrow He got you good. The two of you? Within the semester? Why? You think it's impossible? That depends on the quality. But Choo Sang Woo would only want the highest quality. That's true. 5 minutes to deadline. This is a reminder because I didn't get your email yet. See what I mean? He's uptight already. Don't do it. He's not uptight. He's being thorough. If you say so. It's your turn. Call him? Freerider 3 Well, maybe he has a good reason. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Toxic Boss Toxic Boss Huh? Toxic Boss Toxic Boss What a surprise. Hello? It's Sang Woo. I know. Something wrong? It's midnight and I didn't get your email. Damn. That's why you called? I'll bring it with me tomorrow. Jae Young. Yeah? I hear someone playing pool. Please stick to your deadline next time. Okay, Mr. Tenacious. Choo Sang Woo. From now on, call me instead of texting. Why? Well, I like this more. Good night. You too, hyung. I'm calling it a night. You pick up the tab. But you asked to play! Bro! Bro! Are you listening? I'm busy, man. This is an emergency. - You remember this table? - What? Huh? That's the Ji Hye you always talked about? Holy! You know her? Then did you see the guy she was with? Is he handsome? Tall? What's he like? He... looks pretty good. And he has a pretty smile. What? Prettier than mine? Look, look! Stop being so clingy! Don't you have class at 8 a.m.? Right. You're not going home? Character Details It looks good. Let's go with this. You did great. Well, spare me the compliment. You know no one can write this in a day, right? You little devil. I know. I wouldn't expect it from just anyone. But I knew you could pull it off. What do you like about it? Be more specific. Well... it was only an overall opinion. But when you digitize the characters, separate the body parts so we can animate them. And PNG files would be... I'll write these in an email. And... I'm letting you know in advance. You did well, so I'll pat your head. What just happened? What was that just now? - I don't want to tell you. - Again? Like last time? When will you want to? Where are you going? I followed Sang Woo here, but I never expected to see you. Same here. I didn't expect you to tag along. Are you incapable of eating alone? Yeah. I can't eat alone because I'm so popular. - Sit here! - Sit here! Jae Young, don't you have a girlfriend? You seem to be really popular. I don't. Someone's keeping me busy these days. Sure. Right, Sang Choo! Did you solve the rollback problem you mentioned? Sort of, I think. Good. Let me know whenever you need help. You asked her for help? And treated me like a drawing machine? Sang Choo. You're going to the library, right? - I'll go with you. - No. He has to go somewhere with me. - Where? - Where? That... That file you wanted me to fix! I can't do it alone. We have to do it together. You're coming with me! You have to come with me! Stop resisting, damn it! Let's just go, okay? Where are we going? Let's use the library! We can't talk there! We'll go to my studio. Your studio? What? You don't want to? Since I need you to be efficient, I guess going to your studio isn't a bad idea. That's what I'm saying. Let's go. It's always better to be efficient. Do you like DEX' artwork, too? Yes. They're high-quality and liked by the public. That's a bland way to put it. Hold on, I'll get you a chair. Whoa! Choo Sang Choo? What? Sorry. Choo Sang Choo sounds the same backwards. How odd! - Knock it off. - What did I do? Don't mind her. Sit over here. Please throw away your trash. Right now. - Now? - Now. Are you satisfied? You got some nerve bossing me around at my place. That sounds funny coming from you. You can even make jokes now. Excuse me, you're not the only ones here. Let's keep it down, okay? I see a good pair of headphones there. Use those. What? There. I never thought I'd see them together. It'll be hard to make a prototype by next week. We've got to try. It's our chance to get feedback from a big company. I wish Soo Young hadn't told her company so much about this. You sure this won't interfere with your coursework? I'm feeling good these days, so I'm studying efficiently. Is that because I dropped out of the course? Not really. Then what? - I don't... - I don't want to tell you. That again? Yes, so don't ask me. But why are you making a game? With your GPA, you could easily get a job. Because I like doing it. Since when did you let emotions decide what to do? In a game, everyone starts from zero. And you get rewards depending on how you behave. You get reasonable achievements, and I like that. Sang Woo. Yes? Can I pat your head? In one minute? - Never mind, then. - It's not that I hate it. If you tell me first. Then... Let's try and make us work. Together. Save. Don't save. Oh no! I didn't save it! I must be nuts! Get some sleep. You're making mistakes because your brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's a lovely way to say you're worried about me. Okay, I'll take a 30-minute nap. Promise you'll wake me up. Promise! I'll use cold water if I have to, so get some sleep. Definitely a toxic boss. Didn't you say we're only eating? Can't have a party without alcohol! Besides, I had to pull an all-nighter thanks to you. I need a drink. I woke you up. You're the one who didn't get up. Yeah? Jae Young. Are you asleep? Hyung. Are you asleep? Are you really sleeping? Hyung. You didn't do something while I was asleep, did you? I'm not like you! I emailed them, so we'll hear back within next week. I have no doubt you did. Why aren't there any customers? This place is closed today. The owner is out playing. Then it's just the two of us? Isn't it nice and quiet? Oh, I forgot you don't drink. Then I'll just... Give me another. You drink pretty well. I didn't think you could. Well, you know... I didn't feel like drinking that day. Then, do you feel like drinking today? Jang Jae Young. Are you drunk? Let's reverse roles. You want to play that game? All right. Go ahead. Hey, Jang Jae Young. Yes, hyung. You know you're a freak, right? Of course. I know that better than anybody. You don't know anything. You doodled on my face, you nutcase. I don't know what came over me. On my brother's fine face. I'm such a jerk! You stalked me, harassed me, and irritated me. I was going to let it slide. - I was going to let it slide! - What? Let what slide... hyung? You should be thankful you're not ugly. Am I good-looking? Hyung? Get lost. Am I good-looking? Sang Woo? Yes. You're seriously good-looking. In one minute, I'm going to kiss you. If you want to run away, do it now. What are you doing? You've kissed me twice already. Where do you think you're going? I'm sorry about the first one. Without a doubt, it was my fault. But right now, it's both our faults. So please forget this happened. Both our faults? It was a drunken mistake! - We were both drunk. - It wasn't a mistake. You felt the same way I did. Am I wrong? I didn't feel a thing! Look! Does your heart beat or not when you look at me? - I would die if it didn't beat. - This isn't some biology class! It's only a temporary occurrence. It'll calm down after a while. Choo Sang Woo. So please don't give up on Veggie Venturer! Even in this moment, how could you think about the game? You're unbelievable. How do I stop here? You're telling me to leave you alone and make that damn game? It can be done. Just suppress your urges and... Are you doing this just to piss me off? - What am I supposed to do? Date you? - Yeah, why not? We've already kissed. So what's to keep us from dating? That's outrageous! Damn it! Damn it, Sang Woo. Let me go! You've got to stop running away like that! - Let go! - Be quiet! Stop making me run. Don't run from me. Now give me time to think. Wait. Choo Sang Woo. Don't you like to get to the core of the problem and fix the root cause? Yeah, so? You're not suggesting dating is the solution, are you? If you're not sure, take a free 2-week trial. You're not some streaming service. Why not? Are you scared you might want to subscribe? I doubt it. Sang Woo. Don't hide from it. Don't ignore it. Just feel it. Then the confusion that's torturing you might disappear. Give me time to consider your suggestion. Why did I stall for time? Freerider 3 About your suggestion... I refuse to... When will the test end? Are you kidding? Exams haven't even started yet. I don't mean that test. I mean a test of my patience. I'm not cut out for waiting. It's killing me. If you have nothing better to do, predict some exam questions. I'm super hungry all of a sudden. I'll call Hyung Tak and grab a bite. You're never any help. Get out. What the hell? Hey, Hyung Tak! - Kiddo! - Come here. I'm doomed. No wonder you didn't reply to my texts these days. You ignored them on purpose. How dare you? What's with the sullen face? Why did you ignore my calls? The girl that he likes seems to like you. - Don't tell him! - Why not? You can't be upset at Jae Young forever! What's going on? Who? No way... - Ji Hye? - She kept talking about you. What kind of person does he like, how does he date? Should I tell him how I feel? She said she already likes someone. It's so frustrating. You've got it wrong! She doesn't like me, she hates me. How would you know? You're the clueless one. I know! I know that so well! Never mind. I'm doomed. She said she'll confess her feelings after the exam. Confess? Are you going to accept her? Tell me you won't. Think about our friendship. Friendship? After ignoring my calls? Forget it. Give me her number. - What? - Now! I'll end this once and for all. I'll never get used to this taste. Sang Woo has a peculiar taste, doesn't he? Sang Choo doesn't drink that anymore. Look, Ji Hye, do you like me? What? I heard you asked Hyung Tak a lot about me. That was just out of pure curiosity! - Don't confess. - I don't have any feelings for you! But I have feelings for Choo Sang Woo. So don't confess to him. It's obvious what he'll say to you. "I'm sorry, I don't have time for that." Thanks for the advice, but you're crossing the line. You're no better than I am, so why should I give up? I see. I fully understand how you feel. Choo Sang Woo... I can see why you like him. He's smart, cute, pretty, and law-abiding. I'm sure he'll make lots of money after graduation. What's he saying? But I have no plans to back out. If you're going to go against me, you'd better bring your A-game. Has Sang Choo seen this side of you before? Of course he has. He and I happen to be very close. By the way, stop calling him oppa if you're not even his sister. And how dare you call a senior student as lettuce! - Sang Choo said it's okay! - It's not okay with me! Stop it. If you really have to, I'll let you call him Choo. "Hey! Choo!" Like this. What? Choo? Damn it, I can't focus! Choo Sang Choo. You're giving me a headache. You want me to call Jae Young? I said I'm fine. I can't stand this. Stop sitting on the fence. Ask me anything you want to know. I'll answer everything. I want to know who he dated in the past and for how long. Tell me everything you know. I hate giving dating advice, though. That's not what this is. I just need past data in order to predict the future. I'm trying to measure the variables. What are you saying? You're saying that you're curious about his dating history, right? Well, let me see who I remember. Joo Young, Sae Bom, Taeri, the senior he dated for two months when he was a freshman. The next two were my type, but I had a girlfriend back then. The ballet major and the flight attendant. That's how many I know. But he never dated anyone for long, and most were older than him. Why did he break up? You know how he is. Easily bored and impatient. I don't think he's serious about dating. Let's try and make us work. Together. Most of them didn't like how he didn't show much affection and tended to be curt. The perfect type to upset a lover. Is he? He wasn't like that to you? - That's not what this is! - Okay, okay. But it seems like he's changed. He said something about testing his patience. I doubt he has any though. But you're his friend! Why can't you believe in him? What do you care? You're not even his boyfriend. Anyways, I don't know who it is he likes, but he's pretty serious. He's doing stuff he wouldn't have done before. That means this one is special. Don't you think so, Choo Sang Choo? I appreciate the info, but don't call me Choo Sang Choo. - What if I called you Choi Yoo Choi? - I would like it. It sounds friendly. - Okay, you asked for it, Choi Yoo Choi. - Okay, Choo Sang Choo. I have a date to go to! This isn't like you, Jae Young. Talk about perfect timing! Go inside. What are you doing here? I thought you needed time to think. We still have to make the game. That's your way of saying "I missed you"? When will you be honest? Whatever. You're free to be delusional. I need to modify the detail renderings, right? What? Do I look like a punk? A little. What does it mean? Nothing. I just wanted one. Want me to draw you one? No, thanks. Hold still. I have just the thing for you. What are you drawing? Something you'll like. You seem to like it. You keep looking at it. I'll have a hard time erasing it, again. I put a lot of effort into that, so I would hope it lasts. Jae Young. Yeah? What's included in the 2-week trial? It doesn't mean I've made up my mind! We will hold hands. We've already kissed. That's the end of your preview. So? Do you want a paid subscription? Not really. You looked like you were going to pay. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - Did not. - Did, too. He's doing stuff he wouldn't have done before. That means this one is special. Two weeks... I could do two weeks, right? I'll announce my conclusion. Does that sound too formal? I accept your suggestion. Let's start the free trial. Holy cow! It's really DEX? Is this for real? That's awesome! That hurts, dude. This is crazy! It's from DEX! Jae Young, I have something to say. Hey, you're here. Let me get up! What is it? Well... What's going on here? Congratulations! We are pleased to offer you a position at DEX! That's how talented your partner is. Congratulations! Thanks. Then, are you going straight to France? You wanted to say something? It's nothing. Should I turn down DEX? Do you know what you're saying? What's there to know? Come on, you need me. Just focus on your remaining work. I'll take care of the rest. The rest? What do you mean? If I run out of coffee, then I'll just have to get new ones. I can take care of myself. Choo Sang Woo! Never mind. Forget it. Cheers! - You're awesome! - How'd you get an offer from DEX? You're probably the first! It's not fair. Jae Young's always had it all. Before you go, let's take lots of pictures so I can brag about it online. That's enough flattery for one day, guys. Oh, right. Then what happens to the game you were working on? People at my company want to follow up on it. I was going to call them tomorrow. They'll have to find someone else. This is DEX we're talking about. The choice is obvious! Maybe. But the people at my company were also impressed by his design, so this might affect the game. Sang Woo would be disappointed too. Do you think we could visit DEX headquarters if we went to France? - Drink up. We can get accepted, too. - Really? - We can? - Of course! - Yeah, I wish. - When are we getting a job? Not anytime soon. - I envy him. - How much does DEX pay? Probably ten times what I earn. Ten times? - That much? - Yeah! It's DEX! Those clowns talk like they envy you, but you know they'll talk behind your back, right? When I was alone with Sang Choo, he wanted me to spill my guts about your dating history. You didn't! So I kindly obliged and counted each and every one. Thankfully, I didn't have to use more than ten fingers. We were definitely enemies in a past life. I should've stopped there. I don't know what came over me, but I told him that you must be pretty serious about this one. Was I wrong? I don't know. He treats me like I'm replaceable, so I shouldn't be worried about him. But you know what's funny? Because of that fool who asked about my dating history, I can't think of anything else even as I'm sitting here. I want to ask him right now if I could. You wanted to say something? It's nothing. I want to ask him what it was he wanted to say. I want to ask him if he's also sad that I'm going away. Getting touchy-feely over love? I guess you're not so tough after all. Just forget what I said. But isn't that normal? You're supposed to be touchy-feely. You've been acting too cool all your life. If you really like someone, you can't be cool about it. Like now. You don't look great, though. What do you want me to do? Just be yourself! Don't overthink it. Just go with your gut like you always do. This is getting cringey. I'm out. You take care of the tab this time. Like I always do... Nothing lasts. Jae Young: You studying? Come outside for a second. Happy birthday. I'm the first one who said that today, right? I'm ten minutes late, but still. How did you know? You sent your resume with your project plan, remember? 1001. I can't believe even your birthday is a binary code. You're really weird. If I'm already weird, I'll say something crazy. I'm not going to DEX. I'm going to make the game with you. - But... - You said you needed me, didn't you? You said it had to be me. - But that's... - I feel the same. I need you. That's how I feel. I'll give you my answer to your suggestion. My answer is no. Go to DEX. - Sang Woo. - I can't understand it. Did you think I'd be happy if you gave up DEX for me? Sorry, but I'm not some main character in a dumb romance novel. The rational part of you is working against me again. Call me when the backup files are ready. Sang Woo. What does your heart tell you? I'm not interested in that stuff. I just want what's best for you. I mean it. Thank you for the cake. He expects me to leave like this? Bastard. Is this a curse? Happy birthday! I'll buy you anything you want! Cake looks weird but it's not my fault! Huh... Congratulations. We are pleased to offer you a position at DEX. retenir: to hold back to hold back, to endure, to refrain from Long time no see, Sang Woo. Are you doing well on your exams? Yes. Did you find another designer? I'll do that after the exams. You don't need to worry. I'm not worried. I'm sure you'll be fine. Oh, and... The backup files. They're also on the drive. I'm glad I could give this to you in person. Yes, thank you. All that in one gulp? Doesn't your throat hurt? I just needed some release. - I... - Can I go first? I don't want to get the wrong idea and give you irrelevant advice again. Oh, okay. Thank you. I... I like you a lot. I know this sounds sudden. But this feels like the only chance to tell you. I figured I might as well say it and get rejected properly. Sorry. I don't know what to say. Don't be. Your expression says it all. Honestly, I didn't expect much. I just wanted to tell you how I feel. Before, I thought my life would end if you rejected me. But now that I've said it, I feel relieved. And I think I can be more comfortable around you now. How about you? Am I uncomfortable? No. As I thought. You never know until you try! Kudos to myself for being brave. You surprised me, though. How? I thought you'd say, "Sorry, I don't have time for this," and reject me right away. But here you are, drinking coffee with me. I think you've changed. I have? Yes, in a good way. I guess those romance novels were right to say that love changes everything. I'm too jealous to root for the two of you. But I wish you happiness, Choo. Anyone home? Anyone home? Who are you? Are you the tenant? No. We're from the real estate office. Do you know where the tenant is? We came to see the property but can't contact him. - See what? - He wanted to move out fast. If you see him, could you tell him we were here? I'm sorry. Let's go. I'm glad I could give this to you in person. Yoo Choi: Sang Choo. Jae Young removed his stuff from the studio. Sang Woo. What does your heart tell you? - But... - You said you needed me, didn't you? You said it had to be me. - But that's... - I feel the same. I need you. That's how I feel. You're better-looking than I thought. You're in good hands. ...I might put a hole in your head. Let's go. Let's try and make us work. Together. Don't hide from it. Don't ignore it. Just feel it. Then the confusion that's torturing you might disappear. Sang Woo? What are you doing here? Why didn't you answer your phone? My phone? I put it on silent mode. Wow, you called a lot! You're an error code jerk! Error? You're mean! You're never punctual! You're fickle and irrational! You came here to tell me that? I don't know why I'm reacting this way. - Sang Woo. - My head tells me I have to let you go. And I know my words won't make any difference! Even though I know that... I like you! Hyung, I like you. I like you. Can I change my answer to your suggestion? No. You can't take back what's already happened. But I'll make a new suggestion. Choo Sang Woo. Date me. Not the trial version. The full version. I nearly jumped out of my skin. I already sent this to DEX and they want to discuss it further. I told them there's this awesome programmer in Korea, and that they should hire him before someone snatches him away. When did you prepare this? While you were busy finding a designer to replace me. Yeah. I wasn't going to let you go that easily. - But you were leaving. - To settle the matter with DEX. If they say no, I'm going to finish Veggie Venturer before I go. Don't let your emotions ruin a great opportunity. Veggie Venturer isn't just yours. I rewrote the concept and the plan. And you're going to take all the credit? You're definitely a toxic boss. But it's DEX... So what? I'll just work for a better company. Don't you know how talented your boyfriend is? My boyfriend... You like how that sounds? Still, promise me three things if you want to date me. Now that's the Sang Woo I know. First. If you don't want to be disturbed, go lock the door. I already locked it when Yoo Choi left. So smart! Park Seo Ham Park Jae Chan Song Ji Oh Kim No Jin Kim Won Ki You fixed all the errors? Yes. I thought it was a code error, but I just needed to change the output value. Good work. You're prepared for next week's meeting, right? We should just go to France than do all this work with a Korean company. I'm going to start here and expand globally. Of course. Who am I to object to the CEO's plan? Don't you trust me? I do, but not your Powerpoint skills. Is tomorrow is your class presentation? My Powerpoint skills are fine! Yeah, right. Why did you put him there? Well... they say blue characters give off reliability. Delete. You never change, do you? That's why I like you, though. If you keep looking at me like that, we'll never get this done. I was checking your work. I'm going to the bathroom. Don't change anything. Yikes, are these the only templates you have? What's this? Jang Jae Young? Jang Jae Young: Mozart Jang Jae Young: Board, full shots Choo Sang Woo, you pervert! - Wait! - What's this? Don't look at those! You're not supposed to see that! Okay, next. Oh wait. Do it again. I'm sorry. I don't know... I have a girlfriend. Are you throwing it? Go! Aren't you going? I'm sorry. Why? Why? Where were you looking at? This is the last take of the last shooting day!
