[GORAN] What are you giving me? You know what she said? She said she likes you. You know? She said she needs a man like you to make her feel young again. Let's go, Goran. Didn't she? I saw you looking at her, you know? I saw you, but I like the younger one, you know. Like this one. Such a shame she's dead. [GORAN IN SERBIAN] Looks who's come to see you, grandma.

I don't think they would like a Serb student, in Beverly Hills high school. So lived in France, yeah? Why did you come over here? Not many western men here for Serbs, you know. Most of them think we are the bad guys. It's good to have someone like you to see what's going on here. We just fight for our land, man. That's all. Guy! Guy! Guy! What the fuck do you think you are doing? [PETER] Hold your fire, Guy. We got a kid on the bridge. Fuck the captain's orders. We're not gonna start shooting kids. [PETER ON RADIO] We're not turning into baby killers, are we? [PETER LAUGHS] What a fucking crazy kid. It's a girl, man. She's sure got balls. Want chewing gum? Come on. Don't be afraid. [HELICOPTERS WHIRRING] [GORAN] Guy, what the fuck you think you're doing? What the fuck? Is that what you call the truce? Is that what you call the truce? Motherfuckers! Traitors! Motherfuckers! [GORAN SHOUTING] Where are you going? [PRAYING IN SERBIAN] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [GORAN] See her? She's a daughter of a Muslim boss that my father worked for. Many years worked hard, but never was paid good. Then I saw her in prison camp and I fucked her many times. [GIRL TALKS IN SERBIAN] You know what she said? She said I was the best she ever had. - And everybody had her. - They fuck your women, too, you know. [GORAN] That's shit. Our women are stronger. Most of them would rather kill themselves than be fucked by a Turk or Croat. Many good priests and we got this one. [ASKS BLESSING FROM PRIEST] Shit. He preaches, and Goran does the dirty work. Check the houses up the hill. They're sneaky bastards. [CHATTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Hello, my Serbian brothers. I got a little present for you. Good. [SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] What the fuck is she doing in the car? We're gonna take her home. She tell you where she lives? I know where she lives. Did you see the green scarves, Guy, at the exchange? Those are mujaheddin, holy Allah warriors. We're all gonna send them to their fucking god. Look at her. She's been fucking all of them. - She was raped. - Raped? She's a fucking whore with a fucking Muslim bastard in her belly. And her family, my neighbors, good Serbs, great warriors. She dishonored them. Now she wants to get back home. [GORAN IN SERBIAN] Why are you so quiet, you whore? Say something you bitch! [VERA IN SERBIAN] I don't want to talk to you. [GORAN IN SERBIAN] You don't want to talk to me? Who do you think you are? You know what she said? You know what she said to me? She doesn't have to talk to me. You don't have to talk to me? Then I'll talk to you! - What the fuck are you doing? - I'm talking! Okay? I'm having conversation here! Is that okay for you? [GORAN IN SERBIAN] You don't want to talk to me now? Sweetheart? Because I am not Muslim? [VERA] Let go… [GORAN IN SERBIAN] You fucking Muslim whore! I'll teach you a lesson, I'll make you talk!! Look me in the eyes when I'm talking to you!

Put her up to your breast. [CRYING CONTINUES] What's the matter? Are you dry? You have no milk? It's all right. You can feed her when you get home. [ENGINE STARTS] [CRYING CONTINUES] Can't you at least hold the thing? [HONKS HORN] [ENGINE OFF, SETS BRAKE] [VERA'S MOTHER] Oh my god, you're alive! My sweet angel.

[SINGING] [SINGING] [SINGING] [VERA'S BROTHER IN SERBIAN] Papa said, you and the baby must go. You must go and take them with you. I can't take them with me. They can't stay here. [BABY COOING] [ENGINE STARTS] Vera! Do you have any cousins? Do you know anybody? All right, here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna take you to the refugee camp in Bileca. Bileca? Somebody there will take you in. If you don't want that kid, somebody will take it too. I'll be done with this bullshit. [BABY CRYING] [CRYING CONTINUES] I tried to help you, but fuck it. You know? Fuck it. I'm done. [CRYING CONTINUES] Jesus Christ. That's driving me nuts. Doesn't it make you feel anything? You think maybe this one time you could just stick a bottle in that kid's mouth, so I could get you where you need to go? [CRYING CONTINUES] Son of a bitch. I'll feed the little bitch myself. [CRYING CONTINUES] [ENGINE OFF] I'm coming. [CRYING CONTINUES] Just quiet down, will ya? Calm down. I'll be right there. Where's the nipple? [WHISPERS] Oh, fuck. [CRYING CONTINUES] Where's the motherfucking nipple? You got a better idea? [WHISPERS] It should work. Voila. Be the best use I ever put one of these to. We got a surprise for ya. [CRYING CONTINUES] All right. I'd take it if I were you. It's all there is. [CRYING CONTINUES] Come on. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. You just as soon see this kid dead? Can't do it yourself? Don't worry about it. You're better off for it. It's easy to kill somebody. You just pull the trigger, and it's done. Living with it… You gotta harden up for that. [BABY CRYING] [CRYING CONTINUES] [COOING] Give me the bottle. Your mother's a bitch. But I guess you'll be lucky if you turned out to be as pretty as she is. [METAL RATTLING] [VERA'S FATHER] God bless you… [VERA'S FATHER] Good to see you. [OTHER MAN] It is not good… [OTHER MAN] Where is your daughter? [VERA'S FATHER] I threw her out, why?

[SNEEZES] [COOING] I hope you appreciate this. What do you think of this new style? Think they'll like that in Milan? [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [VERA'S FATHER] Let's go… drive! They must have found Goran's body. You gonna hold that kid? [CRYING] This road will probably take us to Bileca. Jesus Christ! That kid is a pain in the ass! Did you drink any of this? Son of a bitch!

[SCREAMS, BABY CRYING] No! Wait! No! It's not her fault! [VERA'S BROTHER] Wait, let him speak… Don't! I shot Goran. Why? He was going to kill her… and the baby… like dogs. [VERA'S BROTHER TRANSLATING] [GROANS] [BABY COOING] [VERA'S BROTHER] Father, please don't. Please don't kill them. God will not forgive us. [VERA'S BROTHER] Is it worth spilling our blood for that bastard Goran? Think about it… [ENGINE STARTING] It's going to be all right. It's all right. Yeah. It's just through the flesh. No. It's not good. You need to stop bleeding. - I knew you spoke English. - Only, not so good. Yeah. Right. [GROANS] Is there first aid in the car? Yeah. There's something in my vest. Can you get it? Bring it. [GROANS] [MOANING] Oh. [GRUNTS] Yeah. [GROANS] I'm gonna… I'm gonna be all right. There'll be a medic in Bileca. We should just keep on going. [GROANS] You are not good. You should lay down. It's okay. I was just trying to… Why didn't they kill us? He's my father. He loves me. They are my family. Don't lie to yourself. There's nothing for you here. Listen. We don't have to go to Bileca. I could help you get out of the country. And go where? Someplace… Normal. You should rest. [GUNSHOT, SCREAMS] [GOAT BLEATING] [GASPS, BELL CLANGING] [GROANS] [GOATS BLEATING] [DISTANT SHELLING] Hello! [CLANGING, BLEATING] [CAR DOOR SLAMS] [ENGINE STARTS] Stop following me. Where you going?

The English man, your husband? He is just a friend. She asked me if you are my husband. [BABY COOING] I don't remember the last time I slept in a bed. Vera. That's your name, right? That's what your mother called you. Yes. [GROANS] I'm sorry about your family. It's war. It's beautiful. - You are called Guy? - That's not my real name. It's Joshua. Joshua Rose. You are changed your name? - Why? - I had to. Joshua… Did some things. You are good man. [BABY COOING, VERA SINGING LULLABY] [SINGING] Vera. It's time to go. This'll help. Serb uniforms are no good where I'm going. I have decided, you take my boat. I can't take your boat. You cannot walk. There is a town across the lake. Maybe get a bus to Split. - They have buses, even with the war? - Sometimes. There so much fighting these days. Very dangerous. It's dangerous for you too. The clothes you wear belonged to my son. He is dead. He also had a son. Dead too. Killed fighting… For what? I have nothing more to lose. Are you ready? [SOBBING] [SERBIAN] Here is some sugar for the road. May god be with you… Let's not take any chances. I'm gonna land the boat further down. [GROANS] You are bleeding again. We still have to make the bus. I think it's better if I go alone. Wrong people may see you are wounded. No. We both go. We don't even know if there is a bus, or when. What if it doesn't leave for five hours and we have to wait? It's too dangerous. What if it leaves in an hour? It doesn't matter. You said we shouldn't take any chances. Stay here. I will look for a bus and come back. Wait. [GROANS] Leave the baby with me. She'll slow you down. [BABY COOING] Now, on your way into town, if you hear a car, get off the road.
