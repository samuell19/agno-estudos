Okay, guys, you might remember last week I gave that great lecture on Elvis Presley and the 1950s, but today we have to change gears and talk about something that's a little bit deeper, a little harder to get at, which is the civil rights movement, or the black freedom struggle, or what some historians have called the second reconstruction. Which I really like because it ties it to the first reconstruction after the Civil War to show that there is a continuum, there is a constant struggle on the part of African Americans in the south to claim their freedom, their liberty. And, without a doubt, uh, World War II really provides the fuel for this, that when you go overseas to fight Hitler, you get shot at, you see your friends killed, you're going to come home a different person. You're going to come back a radicalized individual willing to risk life and limb. So the Double V Campaign during the war is quite interesting. It stood for victory at home and victory abroad. Defeat Hitler and fascism and his racist policies, but also defeat Jim Crow, the racist south. And they tried to do that, but they needed some help, and without question in one of the most important... I can feel... I can feel the presence of almighty God in this room. Yes! Oh! The swagger is coming all upon us, isn't it? Amen! Crazy Keith, are you crazy for Jesus? Amen! Are you jacked up on Jesus? I am. I am. I'm feeling the almighty Jesus in this room. Are you all hearing me? Let's all rise. Let's all rise and get a good amen. Amen? Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise God. In closing, we are going to read one more verse. I'm going to read from 1 Corinthians 10:13. It says, "But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out "so that you can endure it." How cool is that? That's right! Dudes, how cool is that? It's awesome. You feel what that says? That every temptation, He's going to give you a way out. You all feel me? Can I get an amen? Yes! Amen! Let's close with a prayer. Dear heavenly Father, thank you so much for bringing me in the presence of these wonderful young Christians to discuss and to talk about temptation, to talk about Satan. Are you going to Florida? Yeah, I'm driving. Who you going with? Brit and Candy and Cotty. Be careful. Why? Because those girls are scary. No. Especially Brit and Candy. Why do you all say that? 'Cause they're just so cold. They got demon blood. They're evil. They give me the freakin' chill bumps. Yeah. No, I've known them since kindergarten. They're sweet. They don't seem right, though. I hope you pray down there in Florida. Pray hard core. Pray super hard core. So fucking high! Hit that baby. Good morning, sunshine. Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine, little bitch. What do y'all want? We want your money. Fuck off! Mind your own fucking business. Get out! Your roommate sucks. Come on, Faith, wake up. Wake up. I'm up. What time is it? Doesn't matter. We need your money. Where's the money? All right, really, where's your money? For what? You know what. 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. $325. What, are you serious? That's it? We're not even like half way to spring break. Fuck. That won't even get us one night's hotel room down there. I have another $20 in my purse. Faith. Faith. Do you know how expensive that place is? So tired of seeing the same things every single day. Everybody's miserable here because everybody sees the same things. They wake up in the same bed, the same houses, same depressing street lights. One gas station. The grass, it's not even green, it's brown. Everything is the same and everyone is just sad. I don't want to end up like them. I really want to get out of here. This is more than just spring break. This is our chance to see something different. Everybody else already left. Yeah, everyone's gone. We're the only ones still here. We fucking suck. We're leaving, you guys. We're not gonna be stuck here. We're not gonna be the only ones here. We've been stuck here. Yeah, we've been saving this money since the beginning of the year. We'll figure out a way to get more. How are we gonna get enough money? I don't know. All I know is I'm not gonna sit here another day. I'm not going to sit in the same fucking classroom. We're not gonna be miserable. We're getting out of here. What's up? Um... Can we use your car? No. Why? It's in the shop. Why? Um, do you know anyone else's car we can use? Shady! Do you? No. Come on, Cotty. Everyone's pretty much gone. You know where Professor Stevens keeps his car, don't you? The El Camino? Yes. I know where he hides the keys. Of course you do. Fuck you. Why? What are you up to? Don't worry. Y'all, we can do this. I know we can. Just fucking pretend like it's a video game. Act like you're in a movie or something. We can do this. You can't be scared of shit. All right, you gotta be hard. Fuck that. Don't be scared of nothing. Let's just get that fucking cash and go on spring break. Just pretend it's a fucking video game. Act like you're in a movie or something. You can't be scared of shit. You have to be hard. Don't be scared of anything. Let's just get this fucking money and go on spring break, y'all. Fuck yeah! Let's fucking do it. Fuck yeah! Move! Go! Go! Look, oh, my gosh. How much money is that? Look at all this! A lot. Where did it all come from? We robbed The Chicken Shack. Shut up. With squirt guns. With squirt guns. Are you serious? We did it. We pulled it off, we really fucking pulled it off. It was fucking awesome. Spring break. Take a hit. Fuck yeah! Fucking spring break. We have so much money. You guys are so crazy. Seeing all this money makes my pussy wet. Smell this shit. Smell this shit. Makes my tits look bigger. Spring break. We're going on fucking spring break. Spring break. Hi, Grandma. Having so much fun here. This place is special. I'm starting to think this is the most spiritual place I've ever been. I think we found ourselves here. We finally got to see some other parts of the world. We saw some beautiful things here. God, I can't believe how many new friends we made. Friends from all over the place, I mean, everyone was so sweet here. So warm and friendly. It's way more than just having a good time. God, it was so nice to get a break from reality for a little while. I'll always remember this trip. I want to go back again next year with you. Something so amazing. Magical. Something so beautiful. Feels as if the world is perfect. Like it's never gonna end. Dude, are you ready? We gonna go live! Spring break, what's happening? Yo, yo, yo, what up, St. Pete? You all just got transported. I don't know if you know that, but we're in a magic place, y'all! You are! I ain't even from this planet. I'm from a different planet. I just transported y'all out into fucking space, y'all! Here's some poetry. I was laying on the beach, yo. There's palm trees, y'all. This is the room of the world, y'all. You can change your life. You can change who you are, y'all. You just got hypnotized and transported to another realm, y'all. And this lasts forever. We're gonna change the world, y'all! This is poetry in motion. Big booties and money falling, y'all. Bikinis and big booties, y'all, that's what life is about. Spring break forever, y'all! Let me hear you! Spring break! Y'all, it's like paradise here. I know, I love it. I wish we could all buy a house here together. Oh, yes. I don't ever wanna leave. Uh, fuck school. Just fuck it. Stop. Give her some more, boys. Yeah, motherfuckers! Oil change. Check it out! You know what would be really cool? If we could freeze life. Like, if we could just click it and freeze it and say, "This is the way it's going to be forever." Like having this moment together forever. That'd be real cool, Faith. Really cool. I'm not drunk enough for that. "Really cool, really cool." "I'm so cool, y'all." Are y'all making fun of me? No, we just want to click things and freeze them. And freeze them. And buy houses together and go to church services. And pray. I'm serious, y'all. It's different here. Here we go. Here we go, baby. Doing a good job! That's what I'm talking about! Oh! Take it like a stripper. Goddamn, you look sexy. I want that pussy, baby. You're never gonna get this pussy. Hi, Grandma. I'm having so much fun here. It's so cool looking. The people here are so much fun. They're all really sweet. The food, the guys. You would love it here. I want to come back again next year with you. That'd be cool. No, I miss you, too. But I really like it here. I know, Mom, I'm sorry, I should've told you that I came. You'd never let me go. I'm fine. Mom, I'm sorry. I should've told you. I just wanted to go. I know. Well, we had enough money, so... We wanted to get away and... We're fine, we're... We're... Safe. Um, not drinking, just... We got scooters. We're just driving around. We're meeting people and I'm having fun. I'm fine. Fuck you, bitch. I'm gonna fuck your pussy tonight. No, you're not. You know why? Why? Because you're a little bitch. I will, okay. All right. I love you, too. Bye. I never want to go home. Never want to go back. Me either. Same. I finally feel like I can be who I was supposed to be here. I know you did a really bad thing, but I'm really glad you did it. I feel better here. Eighteen packs for $10. That's cheap as hell. That shit's cheap as hell! That guy we got stuck talking to... He was so weird. Next time, with those people we don't like, we'll talk deaf. We'll pretend like we're deaf. We'll pretend that we're deaf and then they'll go, ooh. That is so mean. "You want to fuck me?" Let me find my pitch. Open your mouth, bitch. I was in the car. I was sitting there, looking out for all the motherfucking police. We were in the back, we just opened the door and we go, "Freeze, motherfuckers! Hands in the motherfucking air!" "Get your motherfucking knees on the motherfucking ground, you piece of shit!" "Down, motherfuckers! Down, motherfuckers, down!" Get on your fucking knees. Faith, get on your fucking knees. "Get your motherfucking knees on the fucking ground!" What did they do? They fucking got on the ground. You wanna die tonight? I don't think so! Give me your wallet now! Give me your fucking wallet! I put my shit up to this bitch, and I was going, "Yo, fucking get on your goddamn knees "before I shoot your motherfucking face off." "Give me your motherfucking money, I won't kill you." Give me your fucking wallet, now! You fucking hear me? You fucking hear me? "You want to fucking die tonight? "You want to fucking die tonight? Give me all your goddamn money. "Give it to me now!" "Get on your fucking knees!" Y'all said that? Yeah, we said it. Get on your knees. Get on your motherfucking knees, bitch! You wanna die tonight? No. You fucking scared? You like that, you piece of shit? Give us your money. You like that, you sick piece of shit? Give us your money. Don't kill me. Give it to us. Give us your motherfucking money now, bitch. Give me all your motherfucking money, now! You gotta learn, man. It's amazing. Stick with us. It's the best way to live. And you'll be a goonie, too. You'll have all this power and all the money you want. Faith. Faith, it's okay. Why is this happening? This isn't supposed to happen. I don't understand. We were just having fun. We didn't do anything wrong. This is where we are supposed to find ourselves. This is where we were supposed to find who we are. Why did this happen? This wasn't the dream. It's not supposed to end this way. It can't end this way. It can't end this way. This is where we were gonna be forever. This isn't the end. This can't be the end of the dream. Now let me guess. Spring breakers? You're not going to be charged with narcotics possession because it wasn't found on your actual person. You will be issued citations. You're gonna have to pay the fines or you're gonna do two more days in County. We're gonna be in so much trouble. This wasn't supposed to happen. But you are gonna be issued citations. You're gonna have to pay the fine or you can do two more days in County. We don't have any money. Call mommy or daddy or do the time. Spring break is not an invitation to do drugs and commit crimes. Thank you. Have fun, girls. Somebody loves y'all. You're free to go. You just made bail. Really? Yes. Morning. Who are you? My name is Alien. My real name is Al, but truth be told, I ain't from this planet, y'all. Alien? That's what they call me. Why are you here? I saw y'all in there. You looked like nice people. Thought maybe I'd bail you out. Everyone can use a little bailing out once in a while. Why? Why not? Come on, y'all, why you acting suspicious? Get in. Where we going? We can go wherever you all want. Cotty? She's got the right idea, come on. I'll be your chauffeur. You're gonna be our chauffeur? Yeah. Y'all can play Beyonce. You all ever been arrested before? No. Never? No. Shoplifting, shit like that? Steal bras? Was you scared? No. No? Tough bitches up in here. Bunch of tough fucking criminals up in here. You went to a party and you got crazy? Did you get crazy? Come on, spring break. Did you get crazy? Smoke some weed? Cocaine? A little cocaine. Cocaine? Shit. See some bitches all up on each other. Yeah. Yeah, what did you think about that? You liked it? You all ever do that to each other? Best friends. I know you're in college. Experimenting. The time to experiment. You met the twins? Now, you got to watch out for these twins. You know, they do everything together. They eat together, sleep together, and they share their women. You know what they are all about, do you? Double penetration. That's how they do it. Ain't that right? Calm down over there. Don't worry, I'll keep them on a leash. How about this one right here. What's your name? Faith. Faith? That's a pretty name. Thank you. That mean you got faith? You believe in God? You pray for your friends over here? They bad girls? They need a lot of praying? You been doing a lot of praying on this trip for your girlfriends? I was just thinking, maybe you did all that praying, and I'm the answer to your prayers. You was all in trouble and here I am. How old are you? You look about 15. But you're pretty. You're all pretty. You run out of money? What did you spend it on, weed and motels? Scooters? Am I right? Spring break. Don't worry. I got plenty of money. How much? Shit, I'm fucking made of money. Look at my fucking teeth. They should call me "Money." Don't worry. You'll get plenty. We do it right here in St. Pete's. We do it gangster. Gangster. What do you say? You want to have some fun? Faith, you want to have some fun? You got a wild side? You know, I live at the beach all year round. I'm from here. My home. Grew up here. I was the only white boy in my whole neighborhood. My daddy cracked out. My mother, you know, same old sob story, whatever. But I'm making this shit work. Only bad part is spring break. That's when all the scum come. What do you do? What you mean? Like for a job. For a job? Straight hustle. I'm a hustler. I'm also a rapper. Making it work. I play all up and down the coast. People know me. I got this song, I got this hook, "Hangin' with them dope boys." People sing it right back at me. Shit, I don't know any of these people. They are singing at me. Swear to God, it was humbling. Like, "Shit, people listening." You can check it out on YouTube. I'm blowing up. But to pay the bills, you know, I've done about every illegal activity under the sun. I'm a G. I'm a fucking gangster with a heart of gold. I'm all about making that money. Always and forever. Are you being serious? What do you think? You better run like you're running from the police. Let the girls play. Faith, come here. Come here! That one? Yo, let Faith shoot. I'm going home. I don't like it here. It's too weird. This is not what we came here for. We came here to have fun and we came here to party and... It is fun. This is not what it was supposed to be. It's not fair to me because this is not what I signed up for, and I'm very uncomfortable. I don't know these people. And we were in jail. And this guy that I don't even know checks us out of the jail and says all this weird stuff and brings us here with these people touching us and talking to us, and I don't know them. And I don't feel comfortable and I want to go home. This is not what I signed up for. I don't like it here. Please, just take me home. Come on, just come with me. Come on, we gonna party. Stop acting scared. It's okay, Faith. Faith, we are not going to let anything happen to you, all right. It's okay. You all right? What's wrong? I just... I want to go home. Why? You upset? I don't like it here. Why? What's wrong? This isn't why we came here. Why'd you come here? I don't like where we're from, so I thought if we came here that we could... Be free or just have fun. Okay, ain't that what we're doing? Ain't we having fun? No. What kind of fun did you want to have? Not going to jail. Well, you're out of jail now. I didn't get you in jail, I got you out of jail. So don't put that on me. I don't know you. All right. And? I don't know what you want with me and my friends. But you should leave us alone. What, I'm just trying to be nice. Let's go home. Please come back with me. Please come back home with me. Let's go home. Please. I don't know you. All right. I'll tell you what. I like you. I like you. I ain't going to do nothing to hurt you. Don't you see that? If you want to go home, you can go home. But then you're just going to be home. You're going to be back right where you started. And you'll be thinking, "Hmm. "Maybe I missed something out there." You want to go? Why? Why you so upset? Nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong. I want to go home. I know. You can. Goddamn, I like you so much. Listen to me, listen to me. You're going to go, but your friends are going to stay. Your friends are going to stay with me. And I want you to know that I like you so much. I really do. And your friends ain't gonna go with you. And I'm going to be thinking about you when I'm with your friends, okay? Let's go home, please. I can tell that something really, really bad is going to happen. Let's go home. Please. I just have a really, really bad feeling about this. I just want you guys to come home with me. Please. Don't leave us. I love you. I'm going. I don't want to miss my bus. Y'all be careful with that water. Lots of sharks out there. The water looks real pretty, but the sharks are waiting. Bunch of vicious motherfuckers. Just lurking. Just lurking. Lurking. Goddamn! I must be dreaming. Like a fucking calendar. These three girls in front of me, I can't believe what I see. How can this be? They're like mermaids come up from the sea. Close my eyes. Every time I look, they're like old fashioned bitches straight out of book. These three girls in front of me, can't believe what I see. You're making it so easy for me. I don't know what I did to deserve this. My lucky year. My lucky life. Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. I must've done something good. Some little kids, they want to grow to be president. Some kids want to be a doctor. I just wanted to be bad. They kicked me out of school, I thought that was great! "Shit, I don't have to go to your school." That was the best thing in the world. Some people, they want to do the right thing. I like doing the wrong thing. Everyone's always telling me, "Yo, you gotta change." I'm about stacking change, y'all. Stacking change. That's it, money. I'm about making money. That's the dream, y'all. That's the American dream. That's it. I did it. Most of my brothers and sisters, they dead. It was all bad. They got murdered. I'm the last one standing. I'm bad as they is. It's in our blood, y'all, and I love it.

God, I can't believe how many new friends we made. Friends from all over the place. Everyone was so sweet here. So warm and friendly. I know we made friends that will last us a lifetime. We met people who are just like us. People just the same as us. Everyone was just trying to find themselves. It was way more than just having a good time. We're different people now. We see things differently. More colors, more love, more understanding. God, it was so nice to get a break from reality for a little while. I know we have to go back to school, but I'll always remember this trip. Something so amazing. Magical. Something so beautiful. Feels as if the world is perfect, like it's never gonna end. And at night here, we can see way past the stars. We can see into the light. It's just... Ah! It's beautiful. I never want it to end. Spring break forever. Spring break forever, bitches. Spring break forever. Spring break forever, bitches.
