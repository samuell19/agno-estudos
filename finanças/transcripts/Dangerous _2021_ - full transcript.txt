Hi, D, happy birthday. I wish we could celebrate it together, but just a few more months and your parole is done and, hey, you can put your past behind you. You're going to love Guardian Island. The Pacific Northwest is so beautiful. I really think I've found what I've been looking for. Susan and Freddie say hi. Your little brother, Sean. How are we doing today? Hey, D, Happy Thanksgiving. It's damn cold here on the island and I'm trying to finish these renovations before the holidays. I really think I'm in over my head this time. I sure wish you were here. I really could use your help. Sean. D, I'm so sorry. Sean's funeral is December 8th. I wanted you to know. Susan. Don't do it. Clear! Bedroom's clear. Clear! Got something. Fucking hell. Oh, Jesus, he's warm. Get him down. Somebody call EMS. Dr. Alderwood. Looks like we lost him. Sorry to keep you waiting, I wasn't... Dr. Alderwood, Special Agent Shaughnessy, FBI. May I? That's a really small badge. Special Agent, do you feel special? Do you mind if I come in? - Please, please. - Thanks. You have a patient who goes by the name of D... Dylan Forrester. Who's that now? Dylan Forrester, the man you prescribed these for. Oh, that D. Forrester. Right, that D. Forrester. He's one of my most interesting, most promising patients. When was the last time you spoke? Yesterday. Why? He broke his parole. Do you know where he is? Has he done something? Well, if by something you mean attempted murder, then yeah. Attempted. Well, that's progress in a strange kind of way. Are you sure it wasn't self-defense? He beat a man into a coma and then left him hanging in his bathroom. Like a towel. I've been working... Well, D and I have been working together to help him put his past behind him. Yeah, well, he's not doing a very good job of that. There are signs of torture on the victim. Torture. It just doesn't seem the kind of thing that he would do. It was, uh... It was me who put D. Forrester in prison for murder, eight years ago. I'm quite clear on what he's capable of. You know him better than I do. - Perhaps you and I should have a session? - No, no, I'm good. - It's on the house. - No, thanks. D has paid his debt to society. I mean, between aversion therapy and my behavioral modification techniques, he's got a full bag of tools to reintegrate into society. Live a relatively normal life. A normal life? There is a big difference in what's normal for D and everyone else. Come on, Dr. Alderwood. Hmm? You know you're obligated to contact the authorities if you suspect one of your patients might do themselves or others harm. Yes, I'm very aware of my responsibilities. I don't know where D is. I'm sure you understand that confidentiality is the basis for trust here and what we do. D is a changed man. He's proven that sufficiently time and again. People don't change, Doc. I'm sorry you feel that way. Well, then unless you have some kind of court order, I feel I can help you no further. Right. Here you go. I will hunt him down before he kills again. I don't need a court order to do that. Huh. You seem determined. Obsessed even. D is in a kinder, healthier place. I assure you, he's not a threat. - Shaughnessy. - Spill it. So D's younger brother, Professor Sean Forrester, is some big-brain history scholar. Suddenly quits his job a year and a half ago and moves to some remote island off Washington. He's opening an inn. Like a bed and breakfast. Wagner, cut to the chase. He's dead. The funeral is tomorrow. Place called Guardian Island. Guardian Island. Get me someone in the Washington State Police and a plane and a boat. You got it. I'm gonna be heading back to the mainland while there's still some daylight. Were you close with the deceased? He was my brother. Sharon, I'm sorry for your loss. The cook, really? - His name is Hugh. - Oh, I'm sorry. Hugh, your new shiny object. - That is bullshit. - Honestly, Jo, I think he's a little weird. - I think he's trouble. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I feel like you're just threatened - because he's younger than you, aren't you? - Are you kidding me, Jo? I'm trying to look out for you. Oh? U-Um... Hi. D. D Forrester. Sean's brother. I'll put you in room 12. We weren't sure you were going to make it. Oh, um... So they're all in the back with Sean. If you wanna join them, I can take your stuff upstairs and... - No. - Okay. I need to use my room first. Sure, how about I show you up? Here's your room. Sorry it's a bit dark. Sean wanted to keep the steel shutters from when it was a navy base. Here's your key. Okay, one, say, "I'm sorry for your loss." I'm... I'm sorry for your loss. Sorry for your loss. Two, give hug. Three... Oh, yeah. Is there anything I can do to help? Okay, pat shoulder. Pat shoulder. Here we go. Pat shoulder. Sean, you couldn't tell that son of a bitch anything. Am I right? He already knew it. History, science, anthropology. Brain like a goddamn elephant. Bring it down. - Show some respect. - Sure. Sure. Mom, I'm sorry for your loss. Don't touch me! You got a lot of nerve coming here. The announcement said said friends and family. And which category do you think you belong to? I'm sorry? You already said that. Is there anything else you want to say to me? No. Perfect. That's just perfect. He fell from a scaffolding. Hugh over there found him. You got my letter. I didn't know if you would come. I'm really glad you're here. Sean always said nice things about you. Me? Sean was the nice one. I am so sorry about Linda. She's just upset. Why is she upset? Well... because her son just died. I thought it was days ago. Is there anything that I can do to help? Okay, you just let me know, okay? I'm supposed to say that. You were a little hard on D back there. Hard on him? On D? He can't feel anything. That's the whole problem. You have no idea what I've been through, Susan. What that thing has done to my family. How many cops came knocking on our door in the middle of the night, waking us up. Waking Sean up while he was studying so hard, doing his best to be good enough for two sons. So if you don't mind, and with all due respect to my daughter-in-law, just pour it and shut it. Please. To Sean. Hey, I'm Massey. Massey, Sean's friend from college. - Yeah. - Archaeologist. You want a drink? It's a wake after all. No. I don't drink anymore. Okay. - Sean's brother, huh? - Yup. Yeah. I'm at a friend's wake. Guardian Island. The FBI? No shit. They sure it was him? Huh. Shoot me the details. - Alderwood. - Hey, it's me, D. Oh. D, how are you? You said that reconnecting with my family would be essential to my recovery. Oh, yes, that's correct, but you can't expect... I just saw my mother. Oh. And how did that go? She told me that I should leave. I'm so sorry, D. But that's an understandable initial response. It's gonna be hard for a while. It's gonna be hard for you. Are you doing the exercises we practiced, the breathing? Yeah. Good. Remember all the hard work we've put in. And D, take those lithium pills too, all right? Don't forget. They'll help. You may even start to have feelings or emotions. - Okay. - Okay. D... is there anything you need to tell me? Anything that may have happened recently? Mmm, no. Okay. You're not the same man you used to be, D. You show them that, all right? Okay, I will. Good. Anything else? No. All right, well, call me anytime. Bye. You're my uncle D, aren't you? You must be Freddie. Grandma says you're insane. I'm not insane. I have antisocial personality disorder. What does that mean? It means a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of rights of others. What does that mean? It means I don't care how people feel. - Oh. - Ever. I also don't have the capacity to feel fear. Neither of which make me insane. They don't? No, I just see the world a little differently. Okay. What do you have there? It's a submarine. Me and my dad were building it together before he... Japanese. Oh, shit, that's him. Sean always saw something in D that wasn't there. Until today, I haven't heard from him for years. I know he went to jail. I knew he got out. That's it. - Yeah, your dad was a really smart guy. - Yeah. - What did he tell you about this submarine? - My dad said that... Freddie, can you go upstairs? Now, please. - Bye, Uncle D. - Bye, Freddie. You don't belong here. I'm Sean's brother. That's the category I fit into... family. You gave up the right to call yourself family a long time ago. I'm not the same person that I was back then. I'm seeing a therapist now and he's got me doing breathing exercises. And I'm on medication. That won't change who you are, D. Wh-Why not? Because you're insane. Don't move. I'm sorry, y'all. You're under arrest for attempted murder. You know the routine. Hands behind your back. Hands behind your back. Now! Spread 'em. The feds are on the way. Let's go. Move. I'll hold him down in the bunker. Move! Right here. Don't even think about it. Go ahead and have a seat. So who all'd you kill? Oh, you'd have to be a little more specific. You must be pretty happy. The sheriff's got the psychopath locked up in the bunker. Every family has at least one nut job. Right, Jo? I'm taking the sheriff and the psychopath some coffee. Hey, Jo... I knew Sean. We go way back. And not once did he ever mention having a brother. A murderer? We was just on the phone talking, and he kept saying to me he wants me to come here and see him. He said that he wanted to talk to me about something. Now he's dead and you're here. It's a little strange, don't you think? What is that? I need to take my pills. I, uh... I can't reach 'em. They're in my front pocket. You see my finger? Step in. Don't budge. Be smart. What are these? Depressants. Help me control my impulses, deaden my response to stimuli. They make me more normal. Open up. Thought you might like something to warm you up. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Would you like some coffee? No. Thank you. Well, if you change your mind... Huh. I didn't expect the FBI to be here so soon. I'm gonna leave this big boy on the table right here if he gets crazy. Good evening, fellas. I didn't expect to see y'all out here tonight. Sheriff, what are you doing all the way out here? We got the call. We came out. We handled it. You handled it. Okay, well, we'll see about that. Why so many of you guys for one dude? You're in charge? No. What field office are you boys with, huh? You can't be the FBI. Not exactly. What was that? Nine millimeter. What was that? Um, w-we should do something, right? - Get the gun. - What? You can trust me. - Or you can shoot me. - What? Sniper, to the lighthouse. We search the house first, then fan out. And Pike, recon the island. Whymper, look in there. - Lock it down. - Yep. Hey, hey. Who the hell are you people? Where's the sheriff? I know who you guys are looking for, all right? He's down the hill. He's in the bunker with the sheriff. Well, well, well, what have we here? Don't move. Really, does it look like I'm going anywhere? Cell phones. Now, you all heard the boss. Every one of you is gonna put your cell phone in my lovely little bag here. Mercy, please. Thank you. Listen to me, man. I just told you where he was. Hey, cell phone. - Hands. - Cell phone. Hey, I got a pretty young thing locked up in a little cage down here. Don't call me that. No one dies until we find out what they know. Copy that. Hey, we're good. Rest of them looks clear. I've been thinking, why did that guy ask if we were the feds? Because the FBI are on their way here right now. Plan stays the same. Now, why would anybody lock you in a cage? I'm not sure. Why don't we open the door and find out? What did you do? I knocked him out. Wait, you didn't kill him? No. I don't kill people anymore. Well, shouldn't we? He's a bad guy, right? - Up to you. - What? Asshole. Jeez. Please, let me kill him. Please. Whymper, status. Okay, go find out what's going on with him. Go. Go. Blanchard, hey! Upstairs, no surprises. All right. How was your flight? Being a canned sardine. If the weather holds, I should get to the coast in about three hours. Any word from the sheriff? Nothing yet, and no answer at the inn. - Goes straight to voice mail. - Keep trying. How's our friend from the shower? Still in a coma. It doesn't add up. D knew that removing his ankle bracelet would trigger a response. In all my years of tracking D, he never left a body or a witness. So why leave this guy alive in his own apartment? Why? Hi, Sean. Where is it, huh? You really fucked up, didn't you? I had to. He was onto me. We'll talk about this later. Felix, what's taking so long? Run, Hughie! Run fast, you little prick! Run! Fuck! Hugh, stop, you fucking coward! Hugh, stop! Come on! Take him. Oh, my God! They killed Hugh. They fucking killed him. They'll kill you too. It's okay. Go sit. It's okay. Come on. Come on. So now do you understand what happens when you don't help me? I hope that makes things a little bit clearer. Hey, buddy boy. Whymper! Holy shit, what happened? What in the hell are you doing in here by yourself? Hey, we got a situation in the bunker. Jesus Christ, someone fucked up Whymper real bad. Blanchard, get down here now. Get down here! So there are three guys and it looks like they have a lot of guns. - Shut up. - Are you ever nice? - Freddie! - Mom! You watch 'em. You're gonna come with me. Oh, but wait for me. Where are you going? What did you do, you idiot? You know, there is so much about you that I don't like. Just thought I'd tell you that. Shut the fuck up. Do not move! What now? Fuck! Hey! Now, what is a pretty lady like you doing with a shotgun? Hmm? My name... - You cut me. - I needed a scream. What the fuck is wrong with you? Goddamn. This is bullshit. Fuck. He's here. My man didn't get it done. Of course, he's here. It's his brother's funeral. Guy's a psychopath, man. You remember Lansing and Harvey? Bogotá? Fucking Missoula. He killed everyone while we just watched. The guy's fucking dangerous. Here's what I don't get though. Why didn't he finish off Whymper when he had the chance? Prison make him soft? No, it's more like a tiger trying to change its stripes. Hey, hey, you okay? Yeah, it hurts boss. Oh, it hurts. Oh. It fucking hurts. - What the fuck. - That felt good. Let's get to work. Come on. - He's in a mood. - Let's go! Pike, let's move! All right, whoever kills D gets Whymper's cut. Good? - Good. - Good. Uncle D! Those steel shutters. How do you close this place down? The lever behind the lamp. The shutters are all closing. Hey, Blanchard's still in there. Well, then Blanchard's in deep shit. Blanchard? Find me a way back in. - What happened? Are you okay? - Yeah, he cut me. You bring this here now during Sean's funeral? Wait, they're here for you? They're not here for me. - Oh, my God. - Oh, right, right. This is just a coincidence. We need phones. Any of these work? I'm really struggling here. - Yeah. - It's so hard not to fall back into old habits. Well, yeah, I know. I know it's hard. I know it is, D. You're not the only one to have trouble with that, believe me. I wanna do some of those things so bad. No! D, you're different, okay? It's an act of will. Use those new pathways of behavior we've created in your brain. But what if there are things that, um, I need to do to protect myself? Mmm. Well, now, that's your animal brain kicking in. Flight or fight, you know. But just stop, count to 10, count to 100 if you need to, and ask yourself this simple question... These things you feel you need to do, are they things you think you'll be proud of later? Well... probably not. Well, then you probably shouldn't do 'em. Okay, I'll consider that. Well, call me anytime. These pills, they make my hand shake when they start to wear off. Why are you here? Fuck you. All right, man. You know how much I'd love to cut your eyes out and feed them to you? I don't... I don't do that kind of thing anymore though, Blanchard. What'd you do to him? We spoke. It was disappointing. Oh, my God, you killed him? - Watch the doors. - Yeah, I'm watching the door. I'm watching you too, motherfucker. What are you gonna do, huh, huh? You gonna go after 'em? No. There's four of 'em out there. Oh, I thought you'd killed two of 'em. I didn't kill any of 'em. That's enough. I want you out of this house and off this island. Get out and take those people with you. Linda, he saved us. No, no, no, he saved himself. That's the only person he cares about and it always has been. We wouldn't even be in danger if it wasn't for him. Isn't that right, D? - Maybe. - What'd you do, huh? Piss someone off? Steal something? Maybe you killed the wrong guy? No. Did you really kill people, Uncle D? - They were really bad people. - Freddie. Guardian Island. They should call this place Murder Island. Shoot the bastard! Just shoot them already! - Holy shit! - Oh, my eye! He shot my fucking eye out. I think I got him. I think I got him. Shoot the one with the shotgun. I can't see into the house. Then shoot through the fucking wall! The whole thing's armor-plated. Now we know he's watching. They're gonna get in here eventually. They're just testing us. They're looking for you, not us. I want you to leave, now, before you cause any more damage. Go. Okay. Okay. Turns out Sean, D's dearly departed brother, had racked up some pretty sizeable debt for a history professor in recent years. But not so much debt that he couldn't buy an island. The plot thickens. It used to be a navy base back in World War II. It gets weirder. He bought it for almost twice the market value with the help of a mysterious wire transfer. Wow. Must be some special island. Seems like being insane runs in that family. Find out who that mysterious benefactor is, will you? - I'm on it. - All right, later. This is your best bet. How did Sean die, exactly? He was restoring the lighthouse. He worked on it every day until dark. That's when he fell. He was working on the lighthouse when he died. I kept telling him just to hire someone. He was so stubborn. Hugh went out to take him dinner. That's when he found him. How long had Hugh been working here? Just over a month. Why? Just curious. Okay, follow the trail behind the inn. It sweeps around the trees and leads about a half a mile down shore. D, I think you're doing the best that you can. He's gone. Good. How are they gonna know that? Yeah, seriously, how are they gonna know he's gone? We'll have to tell 'em. Get that machine off the boat. Start searching near the inn. We need to get back inside that building. Hold. Sniper, you read that? It says D is gone. The boat. Shit. Well, we still got the other boat. Try not to lose that one, you fucking moron. Copy that. Sniper, my ass. You keep an eye out of those windows, Cyclops. I got nothing, just rocks. Hello? Dr. Alderwood, hey, it's me, D. Oh, D, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. - Oh, good. You're still with your family? Yeah, yeah, I'm still here. I was gonna leave and then, well, they needed my help and they're still my family, so... Oh, good for you, D. Good for you. You stick with it. It's just that trying to do my best here and I... Don't be too hard on yourself. Nobody's perfect. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm a little afraid it could get a little messy when I get back inside. I just still got a lot to deal with. Oh, is there a way you could deal with one problem at a time? Just one at a time, instead of all of them at the same time like we talked about. Yeah, yeah, I could do that. Usually easier that way. Yeah, it is. Yeah. You're the D we need you to be, all right? Keep at it, son. Thanks for the advice. Okay, good, call me whenever you need. Oh, for God's sake, don't kill anybody. I can't see shit. All right, let's try the other side. Oh, my God, that guy with the big teeth is just standing out there. Hello! Can you guys hear me in there? - Yeah, we can hear you! - Asshole. Sooner or later, that door is gonna open whether you like it or not. So when that door does open, I want you to, uh... I want you to remember one thing. Just go away. What do you want? I don't need any of you alive. But if any one of you happens to be able to help me find what I came here for, well, then... maybe we'll be able to work something out. What do these guys want? D's not even in here anymore. Maybe D was right, maybe they're not here for him. Maybe not, but if they don't want D, we need to find out what they do want. Did you find me a boat yet? Everything's closed till tomorrow, but here's something, it might be nothing, but a 36-foot luxury yacht was reported stolen from a marina about an hour down the coast yesterday. Was it D? No, a local boat captain from that same marina says he dropped off a guy to the island today who matches D's description. All right, send me the address of the marina. I need to get on that island yesterday. - You got it. - I'll talk to you. Fuck this, man! Where are you going? The only way we're gonna find it is by getting one of them to tell us. You know that. There's gotta be another way inside that place. Fuck it. Seismic testing. What the hell are you looking for? What the fuck is going on here? Jesus, Blanchard, hey, hey, hey, hey. What the fuck happened to you? He fucking shackled me. - Hey, you good? - Yeah, yeah. Here. Where are you going? - Hey! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking son of a bitch. You little... Oh, I hate you. Hey! All right, you little prick. You want me to shoot you through the door, huh? Don't move. Are you crying, huh? Freddie... go downstairs. You know, I embarrassed myself in front of you down in that cellar, so I'm gonna have to make it up to you. Oh, you son of a bitch! - Mom! Mom! - Freddie! Freddie! What's the matter? What's the matter? Are you okay? Move! Hey, back the fuck up! - Hey, back the fuck up! - Hey! Everyone, hands up now! Ah, you know what? It's just as well that the boy left. My friend Ethel here is gonna join in. Who doesn't like a threesome, huh? You, put the gun down. Put it down or I'll blow her brains out. I'll do it. Just don't hurt her. - No, no. - Good. Round two? You know, D, I feel... I feel that you wanna cry right now. What do you think, huh? Are you gonna beg for your life, huh? Get the fuck up, you son of a bitch. Come on, D, you gotta give me something. Not much point. And why is that, huh? Okay, okay, I get it. You are going to try and stab me with one of these here broken mirror pieces, huh? Yeah. No. Submarine. Japanese. Femoral artery. You're gonna wanna put some pressure on that. Too late. Oh, my God, I really enjoyed that. Let her go. Are you okay? - I'll shoot her. - And I'll shoot you both. What? Are you okay? Are you okay? Oh, God. Oh, my God. You almost fucking killed me. Well, good thing you moved. He killed Blanchard. He shot my fucking arm off, almost. You came back. What did you do, huh? Huh? What did you do upstairs, you sicko? Did you kill him or what? Mom, I've been giving this a lot of thought and I think that I deserve a second chance. Oh, my God! What? What did you do? Mom... ...that I can explain. D, come out. I wanna talk to you. Just stay away from me please. I can't... I can't... That was the worst thing I have ever seen. Hello, D. It's been a long time. I, uh... feel like you've been avoiding me. Well, I have. What happened to you, man? Hmm? You used to be the best at what we do. The absolute best. Now, you're in the system, all drugged out, therapy three times a week to get in touch with your soft side. So what's he call it, huh? Acute sociopathic disorder? Or current psychopathological behavior? Arrested moral development? Come on, D, these are just fancy ways for these people to call you insane. They're calling you insane. You know me, D. Personally, I-I don't believe in insane. You're not insane. I think it's just different points of view. You taught me that, right? You got a point to this shit? Yeah, I got a point to this. Are you just gonna keep pretending for these fucking people, or are you gonna accept what you really are, huh? Because what you are is awesome, bro. That's why you're here, right? Hmm? Sean must have told you what's here on the island, right? That's why he's fucking dead, D. Oh. You don't know. Take him. Take him! Seriously, you didn't kill him either? After what you did to that guy upstairs, what's the problem? - Oh, Jesus. - What did he say? He said there's something... on this island. There's nothing here. There's a couple hundred dollars for groceries, some antiques. No... something here. Sean was trying to tell me. He was trying to tell me something before he died. Sean. Come on, D. You know Sean. He couldn't have been involved with that evil... You're not listening! They were in business with Sean and they are here to find something. What is it? Hmm? What aren't you telling me? You said that Sean died while he was working on the lighthouse. I don't think he fell. No, you said Hugh found him, right? Yeah, Hugh, Hugh. The son of a bitch, he was talking to 'em too. There was something. It was like a moment that they had. - Okay, shut up. - All right. He was one of Cole's men planted here to keep an eye on Sean. But he was working on something. There was... engine grease underneath his nails. He's right. D's been a lot of things, but stupid was never one of them. Where's Sean's office? The cellar. Felix, we're gonna try over there. Come on, Sean, talk to me. Come on. What were you working on? It's not this. There's that sound again. I wanna go after him. I wanna go after him. That freak tried to kill me. If D wanted you dead, you'd be dead. I can sneak back in the window like before. They won't even know. Then maybe you should. It'll save me a bullet. Where's that door go? That's the wine cellar. He spent two months restoring it when we first moved in. You have the keys? Yeah, I know where the keys are. A footprint. From the boot. No way. What the hell? Whoa! A hidden door? Really? I never drank the merlot. I... I... - Flashlight. - Yeah. - Cool. - Freddie, come here. But it's the... Oh, Sean. What's down there? - I'm coming down! - Jesus. Are you down there? Oh, sh... Jesus. D? What do you see? The video's pretty bad, but we captured a still frame on one of the yacht thieves. I just sent it to you. Wow. It's Cole, 100%. - Who? - D's former employer. A high-level fixer for the criminally rich and infamous. D started working for Cole right after he was discharged from the SEALs for almost killing his commanding officer. D was Cole's weapon of choice. And now, here they are, D and Cole together again. Goddamn it, I thought we'd see the island from here. Look, I'm sorry. I've tried everywhere. No one is willing to sail tonight. I'll call you if I come up with anything. Hi. Is everything all right, ma'am? Yeah. Can I help you with something? As a matter of fact, yeah. You sure you know what you're doing? Oh, me? No, I'm just fucking around. I mean, I'd let you try, but it's best if you have both eyes. Asshole. D? Down here! D! What is this place? D, fucking don't leave me. D could've been halfway to Hawaii by now. Maybe he really has changed. We're gonna get lost in here. How far does this go? This is insane. Oh, fuck. What the hell? Shh! Let's hit the lights. Holy fuck. Holy shit. It's a submarine. Japanese. World War II. Huh? Oh, my God. Sean, what the fuck is this? Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I think I found something. That looks like a tunnel. It goes from the inn... Holy shit. To the lighthouse. Fuck yeah. Jackpot! All right. You guys find the entrance. I'll meet you down there. Come on, let's go. He never told me about any of this. Fuck me. That's why I never heard about this. D. Look. It's the Yamashita gold. The Yamashita gold! What? It's what he wrote about in his books. Fuck! What's that? God, you scared the hell out of me. What's going on? Where did D go? Where did Massey... Move. Come on. It's right here. It's fucking real. I thought Sean was full of shit back in school. This is crazy! That what he was trying to tell me about in his letters. He said, "I think I've found what I've been looking for." Oh, fuck! Fuck. Jesus Christ! Run! - Come on down! - Damn it. - See 'em right there! - Get 'em from the other side. Can you move? There's only one shot left. - Hey? - Yeah. Keep up, follow me. Where are you going? - Come on, take him! - Shoot him! I got the bastard! Shit! Shit! What are you doing? You have a cell phone? One of them's down. Are you making a call right now? - Shut up. - Are you serious? - They're shooting at us. - Shh. - Screw you! - Stop. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. D, what time is it? - Uh... - Can you see 'em? Three-ish. Sorry. It's late. I know. I just have one question for you. Sure, shoot. If I have to save myself, uh, could I go back to my old ways then? Well, I guess I'd have to say that you really wouldn't be saving yourself at all if you give up on all that great work that you've done. There he is! What the hell was that? 5.56 mm semiautomatic machine gun. You're being shot at? Oh, yeah, they've been shooting at us for a while now. - D, listen to me, listen. - Okay. Do whatever it takes to save your ass. Whatever it takes? Whatever it takes. Fuck. I'll lose my fucking license. Jesus Christ. Please work, please work. Kill 'em! Fuck me. Whoo-hoo. - Where are you going? - Shh! - D! - Stop! Stop right there. So you've found it, huh? I knew I could count on you. Wow, your brother kind of undersold it, didn't he? It's too bad that he's not gonna get to enjoy any of it. Stop right there. I still need you alive. Hey, asshole! Shoot! Oh, shit! No, no, no. D, listen to me. This is so stupid, huh? Let's just grab as much of this gold as we can and let's get the hell out of here. 'Cause when the feds show up, they're gonna lock your ass up forever. I didn't come here for the gold. I just want my family back. Well, then, you got a deal. You carry my gold and I'll give you your mommy back. Come on, let's go. It'll take days to get this out of here. You don't have the time. Well, neither do you. But you're a good, strong, strapping lad. Let's grab it. Hurry up. All right, give me two ingots, uh, for what your dead brother owes me. That's it. Atta boy. Two more for interest. Come on. That's it. Hurry up. And, uh, you know what, why don't you just give me two on top of that just, um... I don't know, just for the fuck of it. That's it. There he is. That's it, strong guy. Come on, D. Atta boy. Pick it up. There's no rest stops. Let's go. - Whoa! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, get up. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. All right, get up. Pick it up, or else your mom goes flying. Game over, D. You're making a fatal mistake, Agent Shaughnessy. Where's Cole? He's right here. Pick up the gold. Pick up the fucking gold! That's it. Good boy. Hey, D, what are the odds? Huh? While you were rehabilitating, your straight-as-an-arrow brother decides to borrow money from the wrong people. Well... he knew that sooner or later that I'd show up. You know how it is. And now here you are. Oh, D, I gotta tell you, thought I'd be happier to see you. But you're just so goddamn sad to me now, huh? Pathetic, powerless. You used to run this shit. You know why he's doing all this, huh? He's doing this for you, mama. That's right. You don't have to do this, D. - Shut up. - He's gonna kill us anyway! Shut up. You're right. I don't. You're fucking insane! Fucking insane! You're expending so much energy trying to hide who you are, what you are. You're a fucking monster. And I'll constantly be that voice in your head, reminding you that you're never gonna fucking change! I'm not insane. You're not gonna die here. Um... I'm sorry. Stop saying you're sorry. Sorry for your loss... for Sean. When I think back to all Sean's letters, it's clear now that he was dying to tell someone what he discovered, but to keep his family safe, he knew he never could. When he became obsessed with the abandoned naval base called Guardian Island, I figured he was just writing another book. He must have been pretty damn sure of what was under that island, the Yamashita gold, war loot taken by Japanese Imperial forces during World War II and smuggled out of the country in small submarines. Sean put together the clues, but needed help buying Guardian Island. He borrowed money from Cole's associates and before he could pay it back, Cole came after him and it cost him everything. Looks like Sean wasn't so perfect after all. Nobody's perfect, but he didn't deserve to die. They're gonna come after you, you know. Well, I've been hunted before. I can handle it. What about Sean's family, your mother? They'll be okay. I'll make sure of it. What about you? I might try being myself for a while. Bye, D.
