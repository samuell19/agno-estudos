Here... Isn't it for the better? You divorced, but you've got your mother's bar. It's just who you are, Fujiko. You can make anything profitable. To you! Actually, didn't I warn you? I said he was no good. - You did? - I did. I said I hated his face. I should have listened to you, Nonko. Of course, what I say is always true. How about you? Me? There's nothing in my life. Helping at your father's temple? It's a shrine, but that's for Kumiko. I'm really finished with that place. Doesn't Kumiko dislike it? I've no idea. We don't talk. She left, she's not there. She left? It doesn't matter. Take these... - I'll have another. - OK. Let's... become closer friends, we're both divorcees. Fine. We'll talk about everything, like we used to. OK. Here you go. It's rather sudden, but can I ask a favor? I just went out for cigarettes, so I have no money... to pay for these. She's quite pretty. Is she your friend? Not really. Just a former classmate. NON-KO June Purification Festival Here... Nobuko, wait... Ignore her. Hello. It's great! Good fortune! Great. Let's tie it. Then wishes will come true. Excellent Fortune Excuse me... Hey, excuse me! Yes? Are you a local? Kind of... Where's the entrance? Entrance? The festival entrance. I'll set up a stand, so I came to look around. and find a good place. Usual layout... I see. Thank you. Good morning. Hey, wait, wait! What's this? Saving a place. Saving a place? For what? My stand. You'll have to remove it. Please, wait a minute... You need to check with Yasukawa. Please, let me do it. Please. Hey sister-in-law! Excuse me. Wait up, wait, please! What?! Seems he wants to see Tokio. I don't know what's best yet. Maybe telephone? Right, I'll go and make a call. Can you show him the way? Are you his relative? You mean Tokio? No. Of course... No connection. Oh... YASUKAWA Is he out? - Hello? - Hello? It's Kazuto. I called Tokio, but no one answers. So I left a message that you'd drop by. Hang on, it's not for me. What's your name? Me? Fujimaki, Mas... It's for Fujimaki something. Yes... What's with you?! Alright, I'll wait. Sorry to trouble you... I'll wait here. Please go home. You'll recognize Tokio? No... Talk to whoever comes along. OK. I'll go now. Fine, thank you. Are you sure it's OK? Whatever, I'm free today. Nobuko, are you a shrine maiden? I help out... part-time. Temp-work is the trend... Lots of people are like you. Please don't lump me in with such people. You're not like that...? Totally different. Nonko's pretty, isn't she? She's an actress. Huh?! Sorry, I'm not familiar... Her stage name's Nonko Iijima. Don't know her? Been in movies? Of course she has! Right? There was the 'Babe Battles Ninja' one... Also, that 'Sexy Gambler' thing. I don't seem to... Just shut up! This coffee looks weak! It does...? No alcohol during the day? Want a drink? Get me one. Whatever... Good morning. I'm going to make a call. To Tokio? I'll talk to him. No... Want to call from here? Let live, just love, why not? Just go, let go, why not? Get skinny, dried out, why not? Crying, laughing, do it! Why not? Why not? Why not? Hey Hey Hey Hey... Where...? Well...! Good morning. You sleep OK? I'll prepare things. Please have a seat. Good morning. Actually, why am I here? Don't remember? I'm sorry... Must be ashamed. Yes... Exactly what... are you to Nobuko? Nobuko...? Sanae! Bring Nobuko here! I just want to have a festival stand. I'm Masaru Fujimaki. Yakuza connections? I have none. I'm an independent merchant. Please lend me a space. Please! Don't ask me. Please. You need to ask Tokio at Yasukawa's! Recommend me...? Hey! Where's Nobuko?! I understand what you want, but I can't be of assistance. Please... Sorry, I can't approve it. Everything we deal with needs authorization. Business is like that. There's another factor. We invite the same merchants every year. I can't just accept someone new on my own. I'm sorry. Nobuko, tea's getting cold... It's impossible for you to ask the merchants? It's impossible. How will you get authorization? At least you can ask them. Why say it's impossible without trying?! Problem...? No, it's alright. Excuse me. Hey... You shouldn't take it so hard. Regardless of what Tokio said, it should be OK. Corner spaces are empty, if that's OK. I remember! You were on that "Lovely" program! It's true! I watched it every week. Always in a skimpy bikini, holding a sign, so I didn't recognize you. Amazing! Can I shake your hand? - No. - Just a bit. - No way... - Just a bit. Please. Well... Thank you very much. All along, I was thinking the same thing as you. Tokio's a kind of Yakuza, right? So in the end, he'll show justice and duty. Thanks for today. Get on. I'll give you a ride. It's really OK. Alright... Hold on to me somewhere. You ready? Are you OK? Before, I knew a man from my part-time delivery job, someone like Tokio, named Tamasaburo. A real yakuza with a missing finger. Even if he said it's impossible, he agreed in the end. As long as I show sincerity. That's why I have faith in Tokio. It'll all work out perfectly. - This old inn? - Yes. Oh... Well, good night. OK, good night. You don't need a rest? I said I'm OK. I'm really OK. I'll prepare the futon. What's this? Huh? I want to see the world. I don't know when, but... Want to see the world? Hey... Yes? You want some water? Why the world? Well, isn't it best to have big dreams? Do you really believe that? Well... generally. How will you do it? How will I...? It's just an idea at the moment. What would you sell? What...? Well... Various things. It's great to have a dream. Don't you have one? Trying hard at acting... Stop it. I'm not trying hard... What? Nothing... Don't look at me. FROM HOME He'll stay here for a while. Really?! Well, make yourself at home... Oh, oh... I'd better leave here. Masaru, got a girlfriend? Well, do you? There's no one. So, there was before? Sure, like everybody. Really... What happened? Huh? Why'd it end? I don't know. What about you? There's nobody. Not a hint, suits me. Just stay here. Don't mind them. Please see staff Please see staff Bando residence. Well, this is... My name is Torii from Toa Publishing. Is Nobuko Bando there? Nobuko? She's out at the moment. In that case, can you give her my number? Are you ready? Here goes, 0-8-0... Well, you know this one? 'Riona.' You know her? Don't know her?! You're behind the times! I'm not behind at all. Really? Don't you look at the magazines? You must know her! How old are you? Twenty-four. What's that mean?! Hey, what's that? I'm sure she's not on TV. TV? That'll happen soon. You're 24? What's your bust size? I'll check... Stop that! Pervert! Don't touch me. I won't do it again. I'll stop. No way! She hates me. Hello? This is Udagawa. It's Hiroki. But...! Why'd you call? You're good. I used to work in a curry place. Nobuko, wait. Where are you going? Why are you here? How'd you fool Mom? Changed my voice. Space alien calling... Let's go in. She said she's your friend. That was a real surprise. Hey! Stop that. - Stop! - Sorry. You look just the same. What do you want? Well, let's try again. Wait! Not our marriage. I mean our business. Start over together. Wait... Nonko! What's it about, at this stage?! What's this about? I'll just listen. - At least have a drink. - No. At least sit down. A big opportunity! It's so hot! Broken? Try banging it. Why don't you relax? So, what's up? Listen. My partner started a production company. I'll form a partnership and promote actors. Who is your "partner"? It doesn't matter who. But I want you to be our box-office star. You're the only one who can do it. Agent for Actors: Nonko Iijima Don't worry, it's just a sample. My card will be like this. I told you before, you ruined everything. I know that. I'm not who I used to be. But I'm already 36. That's just your thinking. Look. I've... never forgotten about you. It's too late at this stage. Drink up! Even drunk, you get nothing. You're 36? That doesn't matter. There are various routes. My job is to make a road. Your job is to go along it. Right? Can I think about it? Of course! Stop that... Together, we'll see the world. I said to stop... You really mean it? Don't look, turn off the light. Slow, doesn't fit anymore... Huh? Don't know what 'fit' means. Your face says it all Nonko Iijima - "Sexy Gambler" Not there? No answer on the phone. Morning. Wait a moment, I'll prepare it. Thanks. Yes, Muku Shrine. In care of Mr. Shiro Bando. Masaru Fujimaki. Right. To arrive tomorrow, or the day after is fine. Ten boxes would be good. Thank you. - Hey! - Yes? Hey, father-in-law! Father, we brought it. Kazuto, get him to help you with other things. OK, come this way. Right. Let's go eat. I'm going. I'll call. Exhausted... - Nobuko, you eating? - Ignore her. Masaru? Sorry, I couldn't sleep. Excuse me. Want some? Sure. - Glass. - OK. Today... I worked with your father, and I'm really exhausted. But can't sleep? But can't sleep anyway. Go somewhere today? Why? No reason... I didn't see you at all. Sorry... Want to come... to my room? What? Nothing... Well, good night. Nice tower this year. Higher than before... Look at this! You look just like Kumiko. Identical laughing faces! See, just look. Kumiko looks so mature. Who's that? Coming... Please sign here. OK. Thanks. Here's your copy. - Thank you. - Thanks a lot. Know what they are? Look. Aren't they great? Chicks. Male chicks from someone I know at a hatchery. Really cheap, almost free. They used to sell them in dyed colors at night stands. That seems mean. I'll sell natural colored ones. Hey! Look at them! Father! - Get out of here! - What then? Leave with them! The festival is tomorrow! So?! - Mother? - Well... Just until tomorrow! I refuse! Why not?! You let Kumiko bring a man here! Do what you want! Are you... alright? I'm fine. Sorry. I'm sorry. Postponed Due to Rain I'll be leaving. They're cute. Never mind. Just stay. Nobuko Bando This is all there is... Nothing but this... The world is far... Out of my way, Masaru! Sorry. Come here. Come! It's over there. Huh? Come here. There! There, there! There! It's true, a man's living here. Say hello. Good afternoon. Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Fujimaki. Much obliged. Chicks! Nobody home? I said I'd come for pictures... A man? I don't care, but... you still live off our father? You'll kill him. How old are you? You look pained. Where? Still don't get it? It's all over for her. What's that about?! Monami! Yes... - Let's go to the shrine. - Yeah. This one, looks just like Kumiko. No way, not at all. - Let me see it! - Come on. - You look like me. - Do not! You look like each other. Half and half. We don't look alike! Not even half and half! Come in. I'm not hungry, I'm fine. Really? Yes, I'm fine. Excuse me. How long will he be here? I wonder... But it's fine. It's lively. Too easygoing... Bring some beer. - You want some? - Yeah. Father... Meat's ready. - Mother, some beer? - OK. Beer goes well with grilled meat. What's wrong? Let's kiss. What? Kiss... Want me to kiss you? Not really, anybody will do. I want to, now. Alright. Is anybody OK?! Excellent Fortune This will come true. Put it higher. Huh? Higher. I'm scared! You're fine, really you are. Scary! I'm scared! Really scared. You'll be fine, I won't move. Welcome back. We're home. Well, I'll go to my room. Well... It's not... It's not true... that anybody will do. Let's do it... harder. OK. I'll buy cigarettes. Have mine, if you want. I want to think about things alone. Nobuko... Nobuko, I'm in love with you. After the festival, let's go somewhere together. Thanks. I'm thinking of going back to Tokyo. Tokyo would be good. That's not it. I thought... it's OK if things just totally fall apart. I'm really a mess. But I'm not done for yet. I'll give it another try. So I'll return to Tokyo. I see... I'm sure you'll do well. - Not yet? - No. Still so demanding at your age. I want to wear it. Good. Well? Thanks for the Shinto music again this year. Good morning. - Papa. - Come on. It's great!

Let's start. OK, let's proceed. Good morning. I'm Fujimaki. Oh, you're still here? Wait, wait... Why are you so wary? That's not what it is. You're a man! Better show more guts in our future. Let's go to Tokyo. It's almost time! By the way, about there... Is that used for something? No... I see. What about there? What about what? What do you want? I'll get to the point. Please lend me a space! It's my once in a lifetime request, please lend me a space! No way. Tokio, please! Please! Tokio, please. Or I won't let you go! Hey, somebody! - What's this?! - Stop him. - Please! - Let him go! Tokio! Where's your justice and duty?! I owe you neither! Kick him out! You failed me! Stop it! What are you doing? Stop it! Stop that! I'm sorry. It's over. Back to your places. Hey, come on. What are you doing?! Get out! Leave here now! Are you OK? We're sorry for the trouble. Sorry for the disturbance, it's finished. I'll go back today. OK, let's meet there. Where should I go? What? Forgive me! I don't understand. What is it? What I said was a lie. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. A lie? I wanted to borrow money with you as guarantor. I intended to pay off my debt with the money. I talked to Fujiko, she's going to help me. We'll try hard together to lead good lives. Also, she can't stand to see... how miserable you are. Miserable? What's that mean? Fujiko...? Stand up. Just stand up! Nobuko... Can't stand it! Hey, hey, do something! Quickly! Hey, now! Masaru!
