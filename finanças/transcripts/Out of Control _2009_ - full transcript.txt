Come on. No, no, no. Don't lay that on me, OK? I'll get there when I'll get there. No, look! I'm doing you a favour, OK? I got a demand list the size of-- I gotta go. You know, you could really hurt yourself sneaking up on a guy like that. but I guess you already know that, right? So, uh, lay it on me. I--I got your money. Come on. You're the last guy that I'd mess with! Uh, so how about a little s-s-sample of the stuff while you count it up? Please! : Pencils down, please. - Come on! Come on! : And he's gonna let it go on a bounce here... - Hey, Dad! - Hey, darling. - Last Friday's game. - You can see where he's aimed it right out of bounds... - They won. I thought you were supposed to be doing your stretches. - Oh, I'm sick of stretches. - Well, I'm sick of harping on you. But... - Aw, all right, all right. Easy, easy, easy, easy. Take it from me, Marcie... don't get old. - You're not old, Dad. You're delusional. No sane person over 35 tries rollerblading. I mean, if I did what you did you'd say I went looking for trouble and I found it. - Oh, I don't need you to remind me I'm a jerk. Heh! Heh! Your mother did that till the day she died. Sometimes I just wish-- When are you gonna grow up? - Dad-- - You know what I'm talking about. You're still on that detective fantasy. - Dad, I didn't come here to argue! I just hoped by now you would've gotten over that. Be married with kids? Dad, I just-- I haven't found Mr. Right yet, OK? What do you want me to do? Go off and get married to some guy, so you can become a grandfather? - Oh, Marcie! - Let's just get back to work. - Ah. - Fabio, I'm home! So, did you miss me? Oh, I thought you did. Well, I didn't even think about you. : Hi, you've been selected for a romantic weekend for two. take advantage of this unique oppor-- What do you think, Fabio? You and me on a romantic weekend for two? You know, if you had feet or I had fins, you and I might have a life. Cutler. I'm on my way. : Jesse! Jesse! Yeah. - That's where the smart money is, but the best bet's on a renegade pastry chef. - Here comes Sutton. Ever since he transferred in from San Francisco he's developed quite a rep for himself. The poor man's Sherlock Holmes. - Well, there's a ray of sunshine! - That's me. Susie Sunshine! - So what have we got, Marcie? - Four bullets. Three to the chest, one to the back. - The phone's a nice touch. - I guess he used up all his minutes. - I see you got your happy goggles on again, Stanley. I love a man who loves his job. Give me the SIM, please. - Owner said everybody left by 6:00 p.m. Saturday night. Hi, Lisa. - Good morning, Marcie. - Looks like a 9mm. Maybe a Glock. - Glock-9. Practically every cop in the city has one. - And half the gang bangers. - Stone wasn't a gang banger, Lisa. - Yeah, I'm aware of that, Gus. - Why don't you bring forensics up to speed on our victim? - He's Ray Stone, a small-time drug dealer. - And Lisa's snitch. - Busted him 5 years ago for possession. Would've been his third strike. - The guy was gonna wind up like this. That's where guys like this wind up. Don't blame yourself. - You got something on your... May I? I don't wanna wipe away evidence. - I think it's called dust. - It's gone, Stanley. - All right, tag and bag, guys! - Dead informants are bad for business. - Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. This is the Chicago PD. More specifically, my district. - You were the one who told me to squeeze him! - "Squeeze" is not synonymous with "whack". The SOB was pumped with 4 bullets. - You're suggesting it's my fault? - Nobody's accusing anybody of anything. We haven't even had an investigation yet. - Det. Sutton, the voice of reason. Any theories on who or why? - He had 400$ in cash, which rules out robbery. We're testing the powder. It's probably coke. The lab test will tell the grade, then we'll know how far up in the food chain is his supplier. - Stone wasn't a user. - With all due respect, wouldn't your district be better served if we were out doing our job? - I think what Lisa means is we've got a lot of work to do. - Do it. - Thank you, Lieutenant. - Grant, I'm not done with you. Gus, close the door. I hear you're off the wagon. - Good news travels fast. - Look, I'm not here to judge you. I never buried a husband, but I can imagine what that hell must have been like. I've seen good cops get lost to the bottle for less. - I can handle it. - You did handle it, when you got sober and put yourself in a program. You wanna tell me why you're drinking again? - It's no a big deal, Lieutenant. - I'm putting you on warning. Get back into AA and take care of your business, and it won't be a big deal. You've got a promising career ahead of you. You wanna go down the tubes, that's your choice, but you're not doing it in this station under my watch. Are we clear? There really is a heart beating in here and I feel for you, Lisa. Just know that what's said in this office, stays in this office. - Thank you. - Now... go find out why your informant is lying in the morgue. - Wow, you got a great touch, Cutler. I mean, the way you swab is like pure poetry. - Wait until you see me dust for fingerprints. - Ooh! - I've got the pathology report. - Thanks, Gus. - Yeah, thanks for thinking about us, Augustus, but, uh, we already read it. - Hmm. - So how's the investigation going? - Tech is lifting the numbers off the SIM. We'll find out everybody who talked to Stone last night and see what shakes out. - I'm guessing "drug deal gone bad." - I'm guessing "staged to look that way." - Everybody's a cop. - Not Stanley. He's strictly forensics, right? - Well... - Call me when you turn up something. We'll sit down and go over the evidence. - Sounds good. - So you're not, uh, falling for that "just going over the evidence," bull, are you? He's the police detective in charge of the case and I am the criminologist assigned to the case. The fact that he happens to be drop-dead gorgeous can't negate the necessity of our collaboration. : Hang on! First of all... : Be careful out there. - Come in, Marcie. Have a seat. I've got a problem, and I'm hoping you can help me with it. - I'll see what I can do. - I need someone I can trust. Someone outside of my department. I think I've got a dirty cop. - I don't know. I've got confiscated cocaine being looted from the evidence room and winding back on the street. If it is one of ours, I gotta clean house before the commissioner finds out. - Lieutenant, I'm not a detective. - Top of your class at the Academy. Mike Cutler's daughter. You're my best shot, Marcie. - Lieutenant, look, don't get me wrong, I mean, this is a great opportunity, but... snooping on other cops isn't exactly what I'd envisioned. Would you snoop to bring down a drug dealer? Because at the end of the day, that's what we're talking about here. - OK. I'll see what I can find out. Marcie, whatever you find, whatever happens, this is an unofficial investigation. Do you understand? - Yeah. - So how do you want to go about this? OK, I say we start with the last call Stone made and work our way back. That means Johnny Tucci. With his priors-- extortion, drugs, money laundering, blackmail, racketeering-- murder's the next step. Is that his home address? I don't remember any residences on that street. - It's a pool hall. He lives there? - For all practical purposes. - Would you even know who Tucci was if you saw him? Here's his picture. Study it. - Over there. - Oh! - Grant, take the front! You're making this harder than it has to be, Tucci. - Drop it. Come on, drop it! Do it! - This is only about a few questions. - Yeah, right, I know what this is about. - Why don't you tell me about it? Drop the gun, Tucci. - Good work, Lisa. Where's your gun, Lisa? - Where's your warning shot, Gus? - Tucci didn't kill Stone. - Because I know this town and the people in it. You've been here, what I've been here my whole life. - You can be a character witness for this two-bit gangster. He'll need one. - What makes you think you're running this investigation? - I'm trying to do my job, Lisa. No more, no less. I'm happy to take this up with Sinclair. - Lead the way. - Fine. - You're too good-looking to be a cop. - And you're too old to be a bad boy. - Look, sweetheart, in recessionary times, we all got to cut corners wherever we can, and I don't want to get my lawyers involved. So let's you and me just talk it out, hmm? - I'd like that. I always think total candour works best. - So, you're the city's "go to" guy when it comes to extortion? Must be your charm that gets them, right, sweetheart? - You dragged me in here to charge me with extortion? - Why would I do that, if I can charge you with murder? - That's funny. - I assure you Ray Stone's mother is not laughing. - I didn't kill Stone, even though he owned me a lot of money. - And I didn't say he was dead. I know you were the last person that talked to him. - Don't be so sure. - You've got a suspect to interview. If you two can't figure out how to handle that, you're in the wrong profession. : There's lots of people who wanted to talk to Ray. : What kind of people? - The kind he owed money to... - That's a damn good question. Sit tight, Grant. - Wait. Whatever she did, she got his attention. - Well, maybe she flashed him. - That's enough. At least she's acting like a professional. - She's a forensic scientist pretending to be a cop! - Looks like she's a natural. - You and Stone had 5 conversations that night and 2 the night before. 18 calls this month alone. The shortest lasting 26 seconds and the longest 4 minutes. Short and to the point. A lot of people get carried away on the phone these days. - Hmm. - I've got a lot of reasons to think that you killed Stone. How many do you have to prove otherwise? - You're running this department, Lt. Sinclair. You can't let the criminologist conduct an interrogation! - Don't you have some work to do, Grant? Because if not, I'd be happy to give you an assignment. - There's evidence in the case suggesting otherwise. - Help me out... - Sorry about that. What did you do? : I don't know. - You can't be responsible for her behaviour. - Ray Stone was shot to death last night. Any ideas who might've pulled the trigger? - Look, I really can't help you. I know a lot of people who thought Stone was worthy of a bullet, but-- - Four, actually. They thought he was worthy of four. I'm sure you have a terrific alibi for last night, so I'd like the names, addresses and phone numbers of anyone that can vouch for you. - Whatever rocks your boat, sweetheart. I'll be out before that ink dries. - In my office, now. - Good work. - Yeah. - What the hell do you think you're doing pulling a stunt like that? - You told me to investigate. - Investigate, not interrogate. You put me in a hell of a spot back there. Look, Stone was found with cocaine. - It was too obvious. You're undercover, remember? A forensic officer conducting a criminal interrogation without permission? What were you thinking? - That I'd look like a wannabe detective. That maybe you'd call me on the carpet for it, and maybe you'd get a reaction from a nervous cop. - Did you see anything weird with Lisa or Gus? - I'm not sure. Lisa went ballistic, but she had good reason. - Look one thing I saw is that Tucci knows something. I mean, he's scared, but not because he killed someone. - All right. You got good instincts, Marcie. You do your old man proud. Stay on it. - Hey, if Sinclair brings you up on charges, I'll testify on your behalf. - Hmm! What did you do? - Nothing, Stanley. Don't worry about it. See you tomorrow. - Take care. - No, of course not! He's my associate. - I just asked. He seems like a decent enough guy. So, do I need a debriefing on Tucci or what? - Hmm. Maybe he said something to you that he didn't say to me. - No, he didn't say anything to me. Well, you look like you had something going with him. What prompted you to do it? - I don't know. Um, I just saw him there and I thought I could help. Look, it was stupid and I owe you an apology. A big one. Lisa too. I mean, I was way out of line. You're the detective on this case and I'm just the forensic scientist. - I had no idea you were "bidepartmental." Is it a right lobe, left lobe kind of thing? I just want the murder solved. I don't care who solves it. I just wish Lisa felt the same way. She went nuts over you questioning Tucci. - Oh yeah. I tried to tell her it was no big deal, but she didn't want to hear it. - Maybe I should find her and apologize. - Give her a little time. She'll come around. Look, I know she's been moody lately, but Lisa is a rock. She's the kind of partner you can always depend on. - Yeah, my dad thinks she's a fantastic cop. He taught her at the Academy. I mean, I've always looked up to her myself. - She'll get it together. She always does. - She's lucky to have a partner like you. - Ah! I'm no saint. - Good, 'cause being a saint must be boring. - You, uh, you wanna grab a beer? - I've got to go by my dad's. He had some back surgery and refused physical therapy, so now physical therapy comes to him in the form of me. - Wow! You are a woman of many talents. See you tomorrow? - Tomorrow. All right, thanks, Jessica. Just remind me I owe you dinner. Oh yeah? Your place or mine? OK, bye. I got an address on Stone's mother. You want to bring her in for questioning? - Well, you know, I'm busy. Why don't you get Cutler to do it? Grant? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. Thanks. - You, uh, you want me to apply for a new partner? - I think that bill's already been filled. * Woman singing on stereo, indistinct * - Look, I thought you might like a chance to talk outside of the station. - I got nothing to say to you. - Well, then that explains why you're so stupid. Go home. - You were gonna tell me something at the station. I could see it in your eyes. I can help you. - You got a license to kill! All cops have a license to kill. What planet are you from, hmm? How can you help me? Go home. I didn't say a word. Nobody knows anything. Look, I'm not an idiot, OK? Even a yellow dog knows when he's sinned. I'll disappear. Look, I don't even like this town anyway. I'll leave tomorrow, OK? - It's not good enough. What do you want me to do? - Die. - Aw! Aw! - Yeah! - Oy! Det. Cutler! I passed Biology. Can I work in forensics? Hmm? - Hey, Charlie. - Hey! Ignore 'em. They don't know the first thing about how to treat a lady. What'll it be? - You know, I think I'm gonna live dangerously. Light beer. - You've got me scared now! - Oh! - Yeah, he's in the back. - Charlie! Give me another vodka! - Thanks. - It's the multi-talented Marcie Cutler. - Evening, detective. - I don't remember seeing you in here before. - It's been a busy year or so. - Night school. - Ah! - Well, look who it is! It's Nancy Drew. - Let it go, Lisa. - Oh, I'm sorry. Was I talking to you? Who the hell do you think you are interrogating my suspect? - Lisa, just sit down, please. - Oh! Are we gonna be friends, now Cutler? After you stabbed me in the back? - You know, that wasn't my intention. - Like hell! No, you knew exactly what you were doing. - This isn't the place, Grant. - Stay out of it, Sutton! It's got nothin' to do with you. - You know, when I joined the force, your father looked out for me. He was my mentor. That's the kind of cop he was. But you... No, you're just waiting for me to take a fall so you can grab my job... and my partner! - Lisa, I know we have to talk about this, but not here. - I like it here. - I'm sorry, but you're drunk. We can have this conversation when you're sober. - I'll wipe that attitude right off your face. : Whoa! : Hey, hey! Whoa! - Don't do this, Lisa. - Get your hands off me! - Hmm! Remind me not to piss you off. And I was afraid that she might hurt you. - Well, in her condition, there wasn't much chance of her hurting anybody. - Her condition includes a gun. She's a cop, Marcie. She's got a license to kill. What's wrong? - No, it's just, uh, that's what Tucci said. "All cops have a license to kill". Looks like you need another one. This one's on me, champ. Ah! Boom. - This is silly. I can get home on my own. - Do it for me. - You know, I hate that Lisa's so mad at me. - She'll get over it. - Well, I mean, you're with her every day. What do you think is going on? Let's just say it wouldn't advance our careers if Sinclair found out. - Well, I'm in forensics. I don't answer to Sinclair. - We were lovers. I know, career suicide. - I broke it off a few weeks ago. At first it was a casual thing, but Lisa got more and more intense and possessive and... - Well, then she started drinking. She told me about her husband dying. Her drinking got out of control and I think it started affecting her decisions as a cop. - We'd bust a dealer with a trunk full of money and think: "This slime bag's driving his Benz "with a million in cash and my ass is on the line for peanuts." - Well, cops say that sort of thing that all the time. It's understandable. - Yeah, well... when we were about to turn in our last stash, Lisa would say "who'd miss it." Then her informant turns up dead. - So you think Lisa killed Stone? - I don't want to, but I overheard her threatening him. - No! She's my partner, he's a snitch, and I didn't hear the other end of the conversation. Look, I shouldn't be saying this. Ignore me. - You're a guy who's not easy to ignore. - I'm not sure if that's a compliment, but I'm gonna take it as one. Make sure she gets home safe. Goodnight. - Thanks. - You're lucky I don't throw you off the force! - I had too much to drink. I'm not proud of my behaviour. - You ought to be ashamed! You made a fool of yourself and the department. You're on desk duty until further notice. And desk duty means I want your gun. - I don't have it on me. - It's at home. I'll bring it in tomorrow. - I mean, I just can't believe it! Lisa was always such a great cop! Smart. Gutsy. She reminded me of you. - Maybe, but last night was a different Lisa Grant. - OK. OK, so she hit a rough patch. She's not the first cop to look for comfort in a bottle. - Gus heard her threaten her informant. " - He's not accusing her of anything, Dad. - Good. I may be an ex-cop, but I still believe in evidence. That kind of talk can ruin a career. - What, boozing and looking for fights isn't bad enough? - Look, I don't know this Gus. But if he was a good partner, he'd be helping Lisa, not bad-mouthing her. - You're right, Dad. You don't know the guy. I have to go. - Marcie! Marcie, wait up, wait up! You haven't forgotten the rule against involvement with fellow officers have you? - I'm not involved with him, Dad. - Yet. I'm not even a cop, so we're not "fellow" officers. The truth is you don't want me talking to some man without the Mike Cutler seal of approval. - That's crap and you know it! - No, I don't know it. Look, you think you know what's best for me. You don't think I can figure it on my own. That's gonna change. - The button came off an outdoor garment. The amount of wear as it relates to climate conditions relative to molecule and moisture absorption tells us it hasn't been worn much. - So basically you're saying it's new. - Yeah. - Do you know the type of garment - No, not really. I mean, they could be. I don't really know. I'm not a fashionista. - I'm thinking something like a trench coat. - Oh, OK. Men's or women's? - Definitely a woman's, due to the strength of the thread and the density of the button. A comparable man's trench would be stitched with a higher quality thread. It has to be tougher... - Hmm. - Theoretically. - Right. - All right. Now this is the fun part. See the break in the button? That teeny crack? - That crack held a sample of ethyl acetate, which is contained in clear nail polish. - Men get manicures. - But I tested the button. It couldn't have been stepped on by anyone who weighed more then a 120 pounds. So it could have been a guy who gets manicures and is, uh, anorexic. - Good work. I'm glad you're on my team. - Give this to Sutton. - Be still my heart. - Hmm, sounds like arrhythmia. You might wanna get that checked out. - Yeah. - I'm still waiting or that gun, Grant. - Tomorrow. - What about today, the day it was promised? - It's still at home. My neighbour's kid came over. I put it away. - Tomorrow morning, on my desk, or I'm sending Sutton to get it. Det. Sutton isn't here. Can I take a message? - The prime suspect in a murder investigation has slipped through our fingers! - Don't shoot the messenger! - You could ask my partner. - Come in. - I have the ballistics report if you'd like to see it. : Anything on the button? Good. Sutton, you check out every women's store that carried that coat, then I want you get a list of all the customers who purchased it. - I'm not much on women's fashion. How about if I bring Cutler? - All right. - Thank you. - You know what-- - There you go, detective. - Thank you... Ellen. - My pleasure. If there's anything else I can do, just let me know. - So have we got everything that we came for? - This is the jacket. All the buttons are specifically made to suit the cut. - Great. Thanks. - I work most days and, um, I get off at 7:00. - Oh... Hmm. - She gets off at 7:00. Well, I get off now. If you wanna stay around here, that's cool with me. - You got anything in mind for dinner? - Oh, the usual. Cheese burrito. - How about I make you dinner? - No one's ever really made me a meal in my own apartment. - Yeah. - All right. - So why did you leave San Francisco? - Ah! Well I had gone through a nasty break-up and I wanted to start over. There was an opening. - Oh, you got the wrong guy. Nora and I were together 4 years. - No, she was a teacher in High school. I was devastated when she broke it off. Look, can we just talk about something else? Maybe one of your dirty little secrets no one knows about? - My secrets aren't dirty. - I think I'll be the judge of that. Come on, lay it on me. - OK. Um... Well, I lost my virginity on prom night. - Right! Let's get back to me. No, I'm serious. I mean, my secrets aren't dirty, they're big. - Oh, I'm sure they are. - There's another one, but... You can't trust me? - I'd get in a lot of trouble for it. - Now, that's my kind of secret! Come on, give it up! - Sinclair... asked me to, um... - Sinclair asked me to, um... ask around about Tucci. You know, apparently he turned up missing and she didn't want to upset you and Lisa about the whole interrogation thing, so... - Well, I have a secret for you. Your secrets stink. What are you doing? - I was gonna make you breakfast in bed. Come on, get back in there. Hope you like eggs. - Good morning, sir. - Bien, gracias. - You're testing cocaine with bleach! - Somebody's gotta do it. - Household bleach might work for dealers testing product, but it does not cut it for scientists. - Neither does showing up an hour late. - It's none of your business. - It is my business! I have a job to do, and my "I" includes you, which makes it "we." - Thank you, Stanley. We don't know the original source of the blow. - OK, Dr. Frankenstein, what do you recommend? - Well... 2% cobalt thiocyanate with a second solution of stannous chloride. - Hmm, sounds good. - Your, uh, friend was here looking for you. - Come on! The one who makes you blush. - The tricky part is that it can interact with other compounds in the coke, producing a false positive. Excuse me. - And, uh, how do you avoid that? - Experience. So, what did he say? - He wanted to know if you were here "yet," which was an interesting choice of words, 'cause it told me he knew that you weren't here, which also told me-- - Yeah. Only you get to do that. - Yep. - Hmm! Wow! I've never seen anything turn that color before. - Yeah. Me neither. - Grant, in my office. - Do you know where this came from? - Very funny. - I'm not being funny. - It came from your wastebasket! - I didn't put it there. - I'm gonna to do you a favour. I'm gonna suspend you. And I'll recommend that you get help. and I want you in an alcohol-treatment program. The department has a good one, AA. - I think I'm being set-up. - For starters, Stone's murder. The gun is part of it, so is that bottle. You've gotta let me figure this out. - You've got 24 hours. Then I am going to start an investigation. - I'm on to you, Gus. I'd be careful, if I were you. I mean, she's a good cop. Sometimes I think I should talk to Sinclair. Tell her-- tell her that I'm partly to blame. - You're not doing either of you any favours by telling her about the affair. - I know, but watching her come unglued like this... - I know. - Let's get out of here. - OK. - Hey! - To talk. Listen, I'm sorry about the other night. I had too much to drink. - Hang on. - That's a nice fish. Got a name? - You didn't come here to make friends with my fish, Lisa. - No, I came here to tell you that your new boyfriend isn't who you think he is. - He's not my boyfriend. - Your sex buddy then. - OK, that's it! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - Look, I'm just as uncomfortable as you are. If you were anyone other than Mike's daughter, I wouldn't be here. Did Gus tell you about us? You know, Gus plays to your weakness. For me it was Bill. When Gus came into my life, it had been so long since I had been around a man. Just the smell of him reminded me of everything I missed. - This has nothing to do with me. - It has everything to do with you! I was supposed to meet Stone the night he was killed. Someone is setting me up... to take the fall. - Forgive me, I'm a scientist, and I don't understand how you make that leap. The love of his life who broke his heart? Nora Phelps didn't dump Gus. He dumped her. - Why would he lie and paint himself as the jilted lover? There had to be another reason he left San Francisco. I was just about to figure it out, when I got the boot. I need your help, Marcie. - A few nights ago, you were ready to rearrange my face! - I had too much to drink. - Lisa, I don't know what's going on with you, OK? But I know I can't give you the kind of help that you need. - I thought you were so eager to be a detective! Well, here's your chance! Or are you afraid to find out you're being taken for a ride. - Goodbye, Lisa. I hope you deal with your drinking and paranoia. - Watch your back. - This was all happening right under your nose. - I wouldn't go that far. - I've got the lab results. It's cocaine with a PH above 5.5. - What does that mean in layman's terms? - It means there's no degradation, stored in optimal conditions. - The most likely place is the police lockup. The good news is we just found the missing coke. The bad news is it was stolen by one of our own. Let's go pay a visit to your partner. - She doesn't trust me. What about taking Marcie? - It's not the worst idea. Grant came by to see me. - This morning. She thinks that Gus is setting her up. - Come on, Cutler. Let's go. Lisa, open up. Don't screw with me, Grant. Open the damn door! - Wow! - It's not that exciting. - That's easy for you to say. You don't spend every day looking at saliva. - Beretta, 32. Light, concealable, and it still packs plenty of stopping power. - Yeah, I'll take it. - Excellent choice. Anybody ever tell you look like that actress... what's her name? - Probably not. - Step over here; we can fill out the necessary forms. - No, no forms. - No forms, no Beretta 32. - I'll double the list price. - You wouldn't be considering engaging in any illegal activities, would you? - No! No, strictly self-defence. I just hate paperwork, you know. Everybody's paranoid these days, checking each other out. - I hear you. Nobody's read the damn Constitution. - Exactly. Come on! Would somebody who looks like that actress "what's her name" be a criminal? - One second. Lieutenant! - Man, Grant! What were you thinking? - I'll get it into the lab. - No, leave it. We're gonna do it by the book and get a warrant. - Look, why can't you accept the possibility that Lisa cracked under the pressure? People do that. - People, not Lisa. - You believe the best in Lisa but the worst in me, huh? - I know Lisa. - I'm your daughter! - If crimes were solved by taking evidence at face value, there wouldn't be a need for detectives. You know, when I went to the Police Academy they taught us about a little thing like motive. Have you and your buddy Sutton come up with one of those? - Yeah. Working on it. : Ah! Hot. - I suppose you've asked yourself what Sutton has to gain if Lisa goes down? - Be careful. - So that would be "no." You want to be a detective, but you don't want to consider that your suspect might be under your nose... ...or in your bed. - I'm retired, not dead. - With all due respect, this is none of your business. - If Lisa is the best suspect you can come up with, you've wasted the last year training. - I was gonna tell you. - About the romance or going to the Police Academy? - You would've disapproved of either one. Cutler. Hey. Just one second. I have to take this. - I thought you were smarter than this. - No, Dad, you got all the brains in the family... and all the answers too. Damn! - Oh, Marcie, Marcie, Marcie. - Cutler. - It's Gus. - Gus! Hey! Um, I was just half asleep. - Your light's on. Coming up. You're here? - Yeah. I thought I'd surprise you. - Um, that's sweet. But I'm not, uh, I'm not feeling very good. - Well, I do have the magic touch. - Sorry. Um, you know, how about a rain check? - You're not sending me home after coming all this way. - As tempting as it sounds, I'm gonna have to send you home, Gus. Good night. - Oh, man! Am I glad to see you guys! I forgot my keys. - Gus. Hey. - I just wanted to make sure I can collect my rain-check tomorrow night. - You're on. - Good night. - Thank you. Hi, my name is Marcie Cutler. I'm a detective with the Chicago Police Department. I'd like to ask you a few questions about your former acquaintance and San Francisco police officer. - Call Sinclair. - Whatever. Who am I to question? - Precisely. - Augustus Sutton. - Augustus Sutton. - Let me try something. Yes. No. We're shut out. - You said you could access records on anyone. - Yeah, anyone who's normal. - I'm supposed to be able to get into the full database of every cop in this country. But when an 8760 security code comes up, it means: "don't even think about it." Sorry. - Hey, Gus. How you doing? - Growing. - Say hi to the wife. - I will. Are you staying late? - I'll be quick. - All right. : Behind the line. : Can we go in now? - All right. Check out the garbage. : OK, OK. - I understand, sir. You'll have to excuse me, Commissioner. There's somebody at my door. Not another gram will leave lockup or you can have my badge. Come in. - We found Lisa's gun. The bottom of the trash outside her building. The trucks were just pulling up as we nabbed it. Doesn't look good for your partner, does it? What? - Um, I can come back. - Sutton located Lisa's gun. - You'll need to run some prints. Somebody could have stolen it. - Nobody could accuse you of being disloyal. Blind or naive, possibly. Excuse me, but why would Lisa kill her own informant? - Sutton, you wanna give her a motive? - I checked out Lisa's computer. It appears as if she's been gambling. With all of us here? I can't keep up with you. You seem to be channelling a defence lawyer. - Maybe we're not asking the right questions. - She cleaned out her bank account at 6:00 this morning. She's still in the city. - Make sure every police district receives a bulletin with her photo and description. Alert all the local motels to keep an eye out for her. Cutler, you go run the prints on the weapon. I forgot to ask what you came to see me about. - My, uh, father sends his regards. - The button didn't fall off. Look how the fibres have been frayed, as if it's been cut. - OK. I mean, sounding board? Detached observer, employee? You're my friend. - It not what I was hoping for, but it's a start - When things are as they appear, you need to look closer. - OK, uh, I'm a detached observer. That's what scientists do, right? - I'm not talking about you! - No, I'm thinking. Something I haven't done a lot of until now. What if it's not Lisa? - You lost me. Coat, Lisa's. Gun, Lisa's. Informant, Lisa's. - I don't know. The real killer. Because she has something on him. - Or her. - Whatever. - All right. What's the "something"? If I knew that, we wouldn't be having this conversation! - Lisa melted down. Being a detective might seem glamorous, but it's hell, particularly for a woman. You know, throw in her husband's death and you've got a walking train wreck. - You know how many train wrecks are walking around out there? Not all of them have put 4 bullets in a guy. Right time, right circumstances. Look what happened with you and Lisa at Charlie's. She was drunk! You've never gotten aggressive after a few too many? - Maybe she was drunk the night she killed Stone. - Maybe, or maybe we're barking up the wrong tree. - I don't bark or chirp or meow. I do what I was hired to do, which is analyze evidence. - Good. - To work. Danny, I need another favour. A big one. It's really important. - Sounds serious. - Yeah, very. I need all the activity and transactions on this account number and all the documentation for the account owner. Can you hack in? - Piece of cake. - The online activity started just about a year ago. It was spotty back then until May, then it becomes a whole new game. four or five different websites? - My sources tell me that's standard for gamblers. - Spreading the wealth. - Or debt, in her case. I matched the coke withdrawals with the dates of activity on the gambling websites she frequented. There's a clear pattern. - Grant was using the lockup as her ATM. - That's what it amounts to. She's up to her eyeballs in debt. Her snitch smokes her out and decides to blackmail her. She snuffs him. - That will do as motive unless a better one comes long. Nice work, Detective. - Thanks. Is your better half back? - I'll, uh, tell Marcie you came a-callin' when she gets here. - The prints on the gun are Lisa's, right? - The report's being typed. When it's done, I'll deliver it to the Lieutenant. And you can play 20 questions with her. - It's my case, Stanley. - Huh. Oh, Congratulations. I didn't realize you had anything to do except hang out here. - Hmm. You're a real piece of work, aren't you? - Yes. Yes, I am. - Gus. - You might wanna have a little chat with your underling here. - I need to speak with you in private. - Loser. - Later, I promise. I'm just really behind on work. - It'll be quick. - OK, just give me a sec. - I missed you last night. - Yeah. - Um, do you know how many people use this stairway? - Lucky for them. I'd like to keep my job. - OK. Look, I'm sorry. I just had this overwhelming urge to be close to you. - Don't worry about it. - Um, I've got to go by and see my dad. - After. Charlie's. - Yeah, we'll see how long I'm there. - Nothing. - It's as if you're trying to avoid me. - Don't be ridiculous. Um, how about 9:00 o'clock at Charlie's? OK? - You nearly caused a premature death! Don't sneak up on people. - What are you still doing here? I thought you left, like, 2 hours ago. - Something naughty. And if you tell anybody-- Ah, that's more like it. What time is it? - About 9:00. - Hi. Yeah, I'll be there in 10 minutes. OK. - Why do women always go for the brooding, good - Um, I think the smart, funny ones do well too. - Finally, I'm a prince! Come in. Come in. - I'm being sought for murder. - That's crazy! - I murdered my snitch because he found out that I was dirty. See, I couldn't stay out of the evidence room. All that blow sitting there while there was a fortune to be made. - I don't believe it. - Then you're the only one. I'm being set up, Mike. I'm sure you heard the story from Marcie, but you have got to believe me it is not the real story. - Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Huh? You're safe here. All right? OK. I'm gonna make you a sandwich. Sit down. - Yeah, I'd love that. Time for a cup of coffee too. Strong, if you don't mind. - Not in the least. * Rock - So our worst fear is true. It's Lisa. - Appears so. - Not "appears". The evidence is clear. She gambled away everything online and more. I've got the entire history documented. I took it off her computer. She thought she'd got rid of the trail, but she'd left enough to retrieve the entire thing. - You must feel great about that. - Great police work, even if she is your partner and former lover. - Look, of course it's a mixed bag. I feel for Lisa. But a cop's gotta do what a cop's gotta, right? - Pretty much. - Kind of like you in San Francisco. 'Cause you are not the man you've made yourself out to be. - Let me guess. You talked to Nora. She's a real drama queen, isn't she? - You've been doing your song and dance for so long, you have no idea the audience has already gone home! - Marcie. Marcie! Marcie! Hey! Hey! What's going on? - I could ask you the same question, but I wouldn't get the truth. - You're acting kind of crazy! Don't you think you owe me an explanation, huh? - I don't owe you anything! - I don't think Gus is framing me all on his own. I hate to say this, Mike, but I think Marcie is helping him. She's not doing it deliberately. Gus is a pro. He knows how to manipulate people. - Well, that excuses my daughter? - Maybe it explains her. She's just like anybody else, Mike. She's human. I gotta get out of here. - You have nowhere to go. - I'm not gonna get you thrown in jail for harbouring a fugitive. - It's me. Open up! - I'll handle it. Upstairs. My bedroom. Close the door. - I was getting ready for bed. - I know it's late. - Yeah, very. I did my workout. I'm exhausted. Can whatever it is wait until tomorrow? - No, it can't. I--I just came here to apologize. - Oh! Fathers and daughters fight. Apology accepted. - It's not just about that, Dad. It's about everything, including Lisa. - This is Lisa's purse. - Look, Marcie... - If you think you're taking her out of this house, it's gonna be over my dead body. - You're showing your usual confidence in my judgment. - I didn't know you had any when it came to Lisa. - That's why I'm here! Look, I woke up. She's innocent. Everything she said to me was true... and more. I just want to apologize to her. Where is she? - Grant! It's OK. The good guys have arrived. - Lisa... I'm so sorry. - All right, all right. Let's sit down. - Well, well, well! Isn't this cozy, huh? The whole gang's here. Nice work, Cutler. Your daughter's quite a detective. You must be very proud of her. I'm Gus. We haven't met. - I don't shake hands with dirty cops. - Oh. Then you're not aware that you have one standing a few feet from you. - Nice try, Gus, but it's over, OK? - She should be in cuffs. I'll take care of it seeing as I am the only one with a pair... and a gun. Back up! You try anything stupid, you will regret it. - I have all the evidence. All of it. - Stick to what you know, Marcie. - I know that you've been pilfering our evidence room. I know that you killed Stone and I know the real reason you ended up in our fair city. - You think you're gonna scare me, Cutler? - No, but I'll leave that up to the judge. - It's too late. We already called the police. - Good! I'm glad. We're gonna need Chicago's men in blue. This place is gonna be a gruesome crime scene with the three of you unfortunate victims. - It won't matter if you kill us, Gus. Stanley knows everything. - Yeah. - Stanley! Now there's a guy who strikes fear into my heart. - Well, he should. He's got the banking history of your alter ego, Martin Lakefield. It seems Lakefield's been making large cash deposits that coincide with the cocaine withdrawal from our evidence room. - Oh, you bastard! - You didn't leave San Fran because of a broken heart. Seems Gus had another brush with cocaine theft. I had a nice chat with your former Lieutenant. You two were friends since you were kids and he got you into the force. They had the same problem with their evidence room. But rather than bust Gus, he thought he'd give him the benefit of the doubt. He said if he transferred Gus away from his problems, Gus' problem would go away. - Game had to end sometime, Gus. It just took the right woman to do it. - Get back! Stay back! OK. This is what's gonna happens next. I shoot each of you. Then I put the gun in Lisa's hand. I arrive in time to put a bullet in Lisa. I had no choice! She already killed 2 people. She wouldn't hesitate to kill me. Who's gonna be first? Head or heart? It's your choice. - This is your last chance, Sutton. You got 3 seconds. Put down the gun down. - Or you'll be subdued by force. And who's gonna do that? - I am. - How'd you know you'd need that thing? - I didn't, but I saw what he did to Stone. - What if he had shot you in the head? - We'd all be lying inside, and Gus would have given the lieutenant a very different story from the one she just heard. - Well, they finally woke up Gus. You must pack one hell of a punch. - Runs in the family. - I owe you an apology, Lieutenant. I owe a lot of apologies. I've been a danger to myself and others. If you want my shield-- - I don't want your damn shield. I just want you to be the great cop I know you are. - Deal. - As for you, once you've done your time and moved up through the ranks, I want you on my squad. - I'd like that. - You'll make a great detective. - Yeah. - Even better than your old man. Maybe I've been afraid of that. - You're my Dad. You're not afraid of anything. - Except losing you. - Impossible, Dad. - Remember not to piss me off, huh? At least I still have Fabio. - Pfft! Don't ask. Come on, kid. I'll drive you home. - See you. - So... Who's Fabio? You jealous, Stanley? - No. - You should be. Oh, Fabio! So sleek. So silent. So orange. Well...
