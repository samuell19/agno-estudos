- Mom, come on. - Yes. - Got everything? - Yes. - We have to turn right down there. - I know the way. Sorry. Yeah. Dammit. Everything OK? Yes, excellent. Thank you. Typical. Mom. I'm trying to get hold of your dad, but he isn't answering. Maria. Kasper. Wasn't dad supposed to come with you? Your dad had an appointment. He wasn't back on time. I'm sure he'll be here any minute. Jan. Honey, where are you? Dad? Let me. How are you? What happened? Hi. We're on our way, but dad is... - I'll call you back in a minute. - What? Jo? Mats, he's afraid of heights. - Jo? - Maria, please. - Jonathan just hung up. - Take his head and let him look at you. - He hung up? Why? - No idea. He'll call me back. Nice, huh, girls? Maria Liefhebber. We're nearly complete. Take turns looking. Come over here and let's get this done. Sanne, Mats, come on. Just stay here. His phone will ring in a minute, anyway. Half of the family isn't here yet, Kasper. Let's have our picture taken. How do you cope with that Mr. busy man? Oh, it's Jonathan. Tripped? Jan tripped. Is it bad? It isn't that bad. So dad tripped and it's not that bad... ...but they're going to emergency for an X-ray anyway. - Then we'll have to do this another time. - Another time? You knew I only had an hour. Take it without me. Sam isn't here either. - Sam lives in London. - So? Take Mies to my mom, or I'll be stuck with that dog all day. Kas? Kasper? Mom? - How bad is it? - Bad. - Don't tell the others for now. - Mom... Can I come in? Mom, you scared me to death. - Mom, I can't find my field hockey stick. - Wait. Do we have sugar anywhere? - Why use these fucking containers? - Euro in the jar. He said 'fucking'. Mice. - Mice? - Yes, mice. I'm going to take a shower. Can I have something to drink? I'll get that stick. Bye. Have a nice day. Come on, guys. Here. Let's go, girls. - Where are our lunch boxes? - We'll get croissants. Come on. - You're cousin is waiting. - Bye, mom. - Why don't you stay at school for lunch? - I have the afternoon off. - It said so in that note. - But I have to work. - Can't Joris pick me up? - Noa... - I'll call grandma. - I'm going to grandma's tomorrow. Coming. Hey. Noa... Kas, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hey! Since when do we leave without saying goodbye? Good morning, ladies. Hi, Kasper. - Hi. - Bye. - Noa... don't act so angry. Marie, please. God forbid we should exchange information. Mom. I'll call grandma about this afternoon. OK? Bye. everyone. Bye. Oh, Kas, congratulations... ...to Laura. Prick. Good morning. - Hey, Lea. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Did they spoil you? - Yeah, breakfast in bed and... - That's sweet. Yeah, very sweet. - How's Jan? - He's doing fine. - OK, good. - What did Kas give you? - He gave me... a holiday to Agadir. - Wow. Really? Guys, Jacob is leaving. We're giving him a present. It would be nice if you could contribute. Jacob isn't leaving. He was laid off. We're giving him a road bike at the drinks party. It would be nice if you showed up for once, Dr. Liefhebber. Right? Tweezers. We'll give Jacob your regards. OK, so we agree on that. Then the only question remaining is: Why don't we put this pavilion here? - Then the view of the river is blocked. - Is that a problem? Kasper, your wife just called. You have to pick up the children. - What? - Pick up the children. The youngest from after-school care... Sara from hockey training, Sanne has a flat tire... so can you pick up her and her bike from school? - Where's my wife? - Not available, she said. Sorry. Laura, it's Kasper. Can you call me back? She'll call back in a minute. Oh, here. - Laura, Simone just told me... - Dad, it's me. I have a flat tire. Hi, honey. Mom said you'd pick me up. Where are you? Kasper, when are you going to pick up your daughter from after-school care? Calm down. Did your mom tell where she... - What's the date today? - September 21. - No. - Jesus, dad. - Shit. - Hello, I asked you something. Yeah, I'm still here. Leave your bike there. Daniel's coming to pick you up. - I don't have a driver's license. - Can you order a big bunch of flowers? And some chocolate. - What shall I say? - Tell them I'm on my way. - I don't have a driver's license. - At the hockey field, I know. - Daniel's coming to pick you up. - Move the Skype meeting? Take a taxi. I'll pick up the little one. We'll make it. Me again. He's on his way. Yeah, good. There you go. Grandpa. Little monkey. - Can I do that? - Yes. Yes. Sorry. Got stuck in traffic. Skype is moved to tomorrow. - Jan has to sign this. - Thank you. OK, let's surprise mom. - See you tomorrow. - Yep. Bye. Lau? Laura? Dad? 'Big sweethearts, you really fooled me...' Fooled me? '...this morning. I really thought you'd forgotten my birthday.' 'But what a wonderful present. A holiday to... Agadir.' 'I'm really going to enjoy it. See you in five sleeps, sweethearts'. Five sleeps? Not even a week. I thought she deserved a break. - Nice present, right? - Yes. Dickhead. Read yours out loud. It's just practical info. When you guys have to go to hobbies and stuff. - Hey. - Hey. Everything all right? - No. - Right. Of course. Sorry. How's it going with the new medication? Water, tea, coffee? I think I also have cola. - Did you talk to mom? - Briefly. Why? I know mom really wants that photo, but I emailed back and forth with everyone for five weeks. I'm done. See if someone else takes care of it. Hello? Maria. I have to... - Do you still have a minute? - Sure. OK. I'll be right back. What the fuck are you doing here? Tammy turned 16 and I promised her to show her Europe. - You look amazing. - How's your wife? Look, Maria, I've found this on Facebook. I was just checking on you, seeing how you were doing. Tammy when she was eight. I cannot believe you kept this from me. Does she know? Nope. - When you were planning to tell her? - When the wright moment is here. - Well, this is it. - No, she's far too young. Too young for what, for having a dad? You are not her father. Okay. So what happens now? I just walk away and forget about her. Well, you seemed not to have a problem with that eight years ago, did you? You know I wasn't going to leave my family. I knew? Are you serious, I knew?! - Marie, I... - I'm coming. I'm coming. Hi. I need your signature. Your mom's wondering if it's going well? What? Because you sent Laura on a trip by herself. I'm busy, she needed a break. That's all. Is that... - What is that? - Nothing. - It isn't finished yet. - For that new museum? You could have saved yourself the trouble. I'll be in the office tomorrow. Whatever. Jan? Nice. It's amateurish. Want to talk about it? OK. About dad. I hadn't seen him for a while and I was wondering if you... David is Noa's father. Him. - What about that backpacker? - I made him up. OK. Laura, please call me. I'm sorry. It's incredibly stupid. I'm busy. That competition for the museum has to be sent out and there's another big project. That bridge. It isn't an excuse, but... OK, yes. OK, enjoy. Love you too. Told you I still have it. Ladies... For you. - I'm a vegetarian. - Has been for a year. - That's way too much. - Just make some sandwiches. I still need braids. - Where are the lunchboxes? - I don't know. They aren't mine. Sanne, get the lunchboxes. Luna, make sandwiches. Sara, put your hair in a ponytail. Hello. We have glasses. Sanne. Sanne... Asshole. Sorry. If you aren't in front of me in two seconds... Then what? - Have you lost your mind? Apologize. - Fuck you. Sanne? Sanne. Sanne. Sanne. What do you think? Will mom come back or will she stay there? Will she... Of course she's coming back. What kind of question is that? Come on. Come. Good morning. - Good morning. - Jan, how are you? - Coffee, Mr. Liefhebber? - Yes, please. Jan, I... Are you submitting a design for the museum? - I've been doing some sketching. - Sketching? He even had a 3D animation made. Two designs from the same office sends an odd message. It's a bit strange that we'd be competing with each other. Are you scared you'd lose from an old man like me? You're giving yourself too little credit. You know that. Competing keeps you on your toes. If it stops being fun, do something else, Daniel. Simone, can you take the coffee to my office? Kas, can you spare me an hour this afternoon? A stupid present, isn't it? Why would you give someone something like that? - Maybe dad was busy and he wanted... - Yeah, right. Yeah. It's a stupid present. Know what I think? I think he forgot. And mom thought: fuck you. It was her fortieth birthday, so... Then she just gave herself a holiday. Kickass, though. Hey, I'd like it if we just... ...went out for a drink sometime. Or grab a bit to eat. I always visit the building site two or three times. And your point is? - Are you angry about the museum? - No, I'm busy... And I have to keep things going at home, so I don't have time to stroll around... while getting a lesson in architecture. You are angry. Furious even. - Know what your problem is? - Yes, you. Why the hell don't you retire? You make what you think people want to see. - You have no faith in yourself. - You were going to withdraw. An advisory role in the background. Not participate in every fucking competition. How many more buildings do you need to design before you can die? - Kasper... - What? You have to show guts. No guts, no glory, son. Come on, Mies. What are you doing? It's not working. - Alzheimer? - Just like grandma. He found it not necessary to inform us. Not necessary? - How bad is it? - Bad. I asked dad. Do you know more than us? How long have you known about this? A year. Fifteen months. You can't predict the course of the disease. That's why dad didn't inform you. I've been able to work fully in the past year. This incident was because I was a bit tired. You weren't tired. You were confused. That wasn't the first time. So how many times did it happen? How bad is this? I went through five dehumanizing years with grandma. I won't do that to you and myself. What do you mean 'you won't do that to us'? Jan... - Honey... - Dad... Where's the washroom? Jesus. Just kidding. I know quite well where the washroom is. But pretty soon I won't and I'll be pissing in the plants. And after that... ...I'll be wandering around mentally incompetent in a nursing home for years. Mom, is this OK with you? - I understand it. - Well, I don't. You're still doing fine. There must be... Jonathan... Jo, please. Hold on. You don't discuss anything with me. I'm a doctor, for God's sake, mom. Mies. I would have given you a lot more space. I would have designed that museum together with you or that library. You have to do your own things. Not with me because I'm ill. - Why not? You are ill. - But not pathetic. I didn't say that. Hi, Miesje. Hi, Miesje. - Does Sam know yet? - No. - We should call her. - Sam knows. It's broken. - Broken as well? - Yes. Remember how grandma sat there? With that vacant expression? - It's hereditary, right? Or dad... - Not necessarily. - I don't even have disability insurance. - Don't drive yourself crazy. Noa is an only child. It can be a coincidence that grandma had it. It doesn't have to be hereditary. - The chance is very small. - But there is a chance. Well, the chance that you get hit... Fuck, Maria... - Sorry. - Jesus. Dr. Liefhebber, I'm very happy with this bike. - We're going for a drink. - I just came to pick up a bag. I have to go to a conference soon. I have to... Yes, of course. Conference? Yes. No, just... ...busy. About this afternoon: - I just meant... - Do you think my life is just about you? I'm just busy. Sorry. Hassle with my family. Laura Liefhebber's voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. I want all of us to go to a cottage for some days. Please. - A big house on the Wadden Islands. - No. - Don't go along in their... - In their what? Huh? In their emotions? Their dad is ill and wants to die. And I shouldn't go along in their emotions? Why did you tell Sam? She asked about it. She sensed something was wrong. And you didn't think to tell me? Dammit. I can't answer my phone right now. Sanne, where are you? Where is Sanne? - Sanne? - Yes. Where is Sanne? - She can't get in there. - With a fake ID she can. - A fake ID? - Dad... Shit. My car's still at the office. Maybe downstairs. Take it. I'll walk. No, you go home. She needs fresh air. Dad? She's just worried about you and mom. That's it, honey. Good. Are you OK? - Want coffee? - No. I'd appreciate it if you called Jonathan today. - Or go and see him. - He'll come round. He's angry, scared, sad and you say 'He'll come round'? That isn't fair. - Sara? - Yes? Sanne, it's incredibly stupid that I forgot mom's birthday. But it's even more stupid that I didn't admit that to you. Sorry. I understand that you want to try things out. I'm only 14 and alcohol is bad for my brain and weed is heavier than it used to be. I was just angry yesterday. - I was at grandpa's yesterday. - Dad... Mom is in Morocco and I don't even know... I know. - If she'll come back. - Hold on. Listen. Grandpa is ill. Incurably ill. He told us... because he doesn't want to sit and wait until he's incapable of doing things. - Oh, how nice. - Yes, we're very happy. This way we don't have to move. Sorry, it might be my daughter. An extension must be great. Wonderful. In fact, we can... Yes? Can you prescribe me some sleeping pills? I know you all think I should have done it differently, but I wasn't able to. I decided to do it this way after discussing it with your mom. As if you're open to discussion. Thanks for the prescription. Maria, listen... I'm taking Tammy to the Efteling tomorrow and I was wondering if... Ignoring me is not going to work. I want to meet Noa. And I will. Whatever it takes. Hey. Do you still have any weed? He did a pretty good job hiding it for so long. No one at work noticed and I just thought he was incredibly annoying. I try to imagine all the time what it must be like for dad. That you know... Hey. Sam called. She was on her way to my place, but she's coming here now. - Sam? Now? By plane? - No, she swam. - No. - Oh, right. - I have to go soon. The girls... - Is there more you know and we don't? - I only just heard about it too. - Bullshit. - OK, fine. - Hey. Jonathan, wait. Come on. - You be nice. - Yeah, yeah. No, don't. OK, Jo, what should we do? Nothing. If he'd ask you, would you be able to help him? What do you think, Kasper? I'm a doctor. Oh, right. Knowing him, he's already got stuff for that. - Pills? - Gas tank. What? Plastic bag over your head hose underneath it, tape everything properly and... ... turn on the tap. Can I ask you guys something? I seriously want to ask something. What do you think of me, anyway? Kas... We were talking about dad. OK? I know, but I'm asking something and I'd like an honest answer. - Sammie. - Hey. Hey. Seriously, guys. Is everyone stoned? Did you talk to Jonathan? Sammie, for how long have you known about dad? Eight months. - He didn't want everyone to know. - Everyone? Us. - Kind of lonely for mom. - That was her own choice. - As if she had a choice. - You always have a choice. - Then you could have chosen to tell us. - Very good, sweetie. - Dad asked me not to. - And if dad asks, Sammie doesn't. Any idea how crappy this feels? That you guys know something this big and important and we don't. I think she has a point. Guys, I don't feel like this. Then do something you don't feel like for once. Jesus. - Mom wants all of us to go to a cottage. - Please. I have wonderful memories of that. The whole family in a cottage. Sorry. - I understand dad. - Yes, here. But here? - Honey, are you at the hospital? - No, why? Is something wrong? No, no, but I'm on your doorstep. - Jonathan? - Sorry. I'm at Maria's. How nice. I... - Mom, is it OK if I call you back later? - Yes, of course. But, Jo, I... - Of course it's up to him. It's his life. - But he should talk to us about it. - To the four of us. - I don't think so. - Easy for you to say. You knew. - You repeat yourself. - Have another joint. - Wow, nice. Know what's nice? Sending your wife to Africa on her birthday. Everything has been discussed already? And yes, that was a loving gesture. - She needed a break. - Bullshit. You forgot her birthday. Laura just left. Shit happens. - Sam? - What do you want? Want to know why he took me into his confidence and not you? - I just don't know. - You have enough on your plate, Marie. - But they should have informed me. - Enough on my plate? You work your fingers to the bone. You can barely make ends meet. They don't support you financially for nothing. Stop it, Kasper. - What? - Just stop it. That money from mom and dad is a loan. OK? - I'm going to pay it back. - We're not interested in that money. Even if they gave you a 100K. - Hey, Jo. Who was that on the phone? - Nobody. Typical. He gets a phone call for once and it's nobody. Oh, Jo, Jo. Sit down, have some wine and tell us. I understand it sucks that dad never appealed to you. - Kas, stop it. - Oh, come on. - He's 44. He can... - He's 45 and he's... That's what I said: 45. He's a grown man. And he's depressed. Yes, I know. - Can't we talk about anything anymore? - He's here, you know. Touché, Marie. Surprisingly on the ball. What would happen if you quit therapy. Quit that medication. Flush everything down the toilet. Kas... And just tell dad how it is. It always had to be done his way... ...because he knows everything better and there can't be any doubt. No guts, no glory. Arrogant prick. You have to have the nerve for that, Jo. But he's never approved of one of my designs. Not a single one. Just forceful advice while saying: 'It's just a suggestion. Do what you want.' So do what you want then. Throw it in the garbage and make your own plan. Or you could have started your own business. - Right. There he goes again. - Jonathan... Don't walk away for once. Homo! - Let me. - Fuck off. Let me. Mom? Noa Liefhebber. You've grown a meter. - Were you guys fighting? - No, sweetheart. Yes, we were. Did it wake you up? It's so good to see you. Jo, wait. Don't walk away for once, OK? No, no, no. Dammit. You're probably not coming inside anymore. I thought so. Mom, please. Let me. The hare pointed at the sky. But the sun shines from up high and makes everything warm and dry. Time to go to sleep, monster. Can you stay for a while? OK, a little while. Jan? Jan. Jan. Jan. You don't need to shout. I suffer from dementia, not deafness. I hadn't seen those turtles for such a long time. I suddenly wondered if they were still alive. What's wrong? Marie, you have to tell her. - What? - Not to expect anything from Joris. - She thinks he's moving in. - No. She just told me. And she wants a dad, of course, but there isn't one. - Yes, there is one. - Joris is a nitwit. I don't mean Joris. David is her father. - Who's David? - David. Dad's colleague. - David. - Yeah. Sorry. Oh, Marie. So why did he never want to see her? - He didn't know. - Huh? - I didn't tell him. - Why not? Lumbering Noa with a father who doesn't want her? I don't think so. - I'm fine on my own. - Hold on. Who doesn't want you. That's completely different. Honestly... You're such a know-it-all. As if your life is perfect. You're probably the loneliest of all of us. - Yeah, laugh it off, but meanwhile... - What 'meanwhile'? At least I haven't been alone for years. You get involved with unavailable men. Same thing. I don't leave behind a trail of broken marriages. Mom? - You really are fighting. - Noa, back to bed. Now. - I'm going to my hotel. - Sam... Sam. Sammie. Kind of a family trait, running away. And now he's here in the Netherlands and he'd love to meet you. - Who? - David. - Your father. - Really? So I have a dad? Oh, sweetie. - So I really have a dad? - Yes, honey. Wait a minute. Kas... Where did you get this stuff? It's terrific. We should do this a lot more often. This trampoline is great. - Come here. The neighbors. - What? The neighbors. I've often thought... ...that man, I'll never get rid of him. He's so healthy. He'll... He'll still be working when he's 90. Why didn't I see it? That he's ill. For years you've seen the dominant, invincible man you want to see. Kasper is right. You have to talk to him while it's still possible. It would be great if the new medication takes effect. - I stopped taking it. - Huh? When it's very bad, I just think: it will get less bad. It doesn't panic me as much as before. It's just who I am. Nicely depressed. Even though you used to be such a funny guy. Really? Of course not, idiot. - Don't tell mom. - No. I don't want her to worry about me anymore. Do you think I'm lonely? Are you lonely? Who isn't? Sometimes. I'm seeing someone. - A shrink? - No. A man. And? That's so nice. Great. - Hey, look. - What? For 46 years... ...that's an insanely big fortune. That's why I'm at peace with it somehow. - You have to try... - I don't 'have to' anything. I decide for myself how I say goodbye. And that isn't by all of us staying in a cottage. Everything I say or do... ...or not say and do will be scrutinized. I don't want that. I don't want that. Jan? Jan? What are you looking for? - What do you want? - Jan, please. Everyone wants something from me. - I can do it myself. - Please calm down. Leave me alone. Jan. Jan. Mies. - Is he still allowed to drive a car? - That doesn't stop him. Did he say anything before he left? - No. - Nothing? He just left? Jesus, mom. He disappears in the middle of the night. - Sam. - Dad is suicidal, he's in a car. I'm just trying to find out where he could have gone. - Was he confused? - He was angry. Very angry. Hey, Mies. Not at the office. Hasn't been there either. And? - What was he angry about? - Does he have his phone? - Did you do 'Find my iPhone'? - His phone is here. - Now what? - Were you arguing? We have to call the police and the hospitals. Emergency. Jo? - Maria, calm down, for God's sake. - We informed the police. So not at the office. - Where else could he be, mom? - I don't know. Kas... This makes no sense. Sam. Sam? Kas. Do you know something? Did the police say anything? Were there skid marks? What? It's not that bad. He only has some scratches and a broken collarbone. They're doing a brain scan to rule out internal hemorrhages. So far, he's reacting positively to every test. Come on, mom. I'll call right away if there's a change, but I don't expect so. Come. Bye. Sleep well. If Jo calls, I'll pick you up right away. Aren't you staying? - You can sleep in the spare bed. - No, that's not necessary. - Sam. - Yes? Why do we see you so rarely? I'm here now, aren't I? Yes. That's nice. - Sleep well. - Sleep well. Mom? If something's up, I'll come right away. OK? Are you in pain? Here it is. I should have asked for your advice. About this. It's OK. Sorry, sorry. - It's OK, dad. - Sorry. It really is OK. Take it easy. Good morning Mr. Liefhebber, Dr. Liefhebber. - Breakfast? - No. Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea, milk, juice? Tea. Dr. Liefhebber, would you like something? Coffee, please. There, cup of tea for you. There you go. - Want some fruit? - No, thank you. And a cup of coffee. - There you go. - Thank you. Well, have a nice day. Wait. Dad, this is Yunus. Yunus, this is my dad. Yunus. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Mom? Why didn't dad want us? He didn't want me. He did want you. He just didn't know you existed. Why didn't he know? - I thought it was better like that. - What do you mean 'better'? And now? Now he'd like to go to a theme park... ...and spent the night there. But now that grandpa's ill, I thought we might go for an ice cream. - I want to go to the theme park. - I can't leave right now. I can go by myself. - No, you don't know them. - But I have to get to know them. Yeah, Noa. - They only speak English. - I'm very good at English. - I'm going. - No. - No way. - I'm going. I am. Mies. Mies... He isn't here, sweetie. 1976 - Design and start construction. 1978 - completed Jonathan, Kasper and Sam weren't born here. Maria was. Spare key car (left in the cupboard) Important addresses Lea, my wife. This is crazy. - Hey. - Hi. So how do you like Agadir? Yeah, I... I don't know what's going on and I don't need to know. You don't owe me an explanation. - A belated happy birthday. - Thank you. - How's London? - Just fine. - I'm landing in an hour and a half. - Oh, OK. Well, have a good flight. - Thank you. - Chin up. You can change your mind if you'd rather not go. I know. - Hi! - Hi! Hi! So very pleased to meet you. Hey Noa, I'm Tammy. Look, I brought you something. I gave her a phone and I explained her the translate app. This is really crazy. But it's okay, we'll manage. Looks so great. See, I have the same one. Do you like it? You want to come to the Efteling with us? Okay, let's go. Come on. Noa? Have fun. Bye bye. Hi. I've been here for a while, but I fell asleep. Seen nice things? How were things here? Here. I'll pay off the rest in monthly installments. I don't want your money anymore. I don't need it anyway. Then we'll halt it, but it wasn't a loan. No, honey, it's a contribution for Noa. If Sam or the boys had needed it we'd have done the same. - Yes, but they can manage. - Well... I'm not done yet. David White, that colleague of yours... - Who? - He's Noa's father. - David? - Who's David? - He's married and has a child. - Who's David? - He has... God, what's it called? - Is he that backpacker? - Lea, help me out. He won that award. - What does that matter? - The award for that music building. - Yes. And after that, he had an affair with me for a year. - With you? - Jan. Amazing, isn't it, that such a brilliant man wants me? But it's true. For a while, at least. Until he suddenly went back to America and his wife. And then I turned out to be pregnant. So how about that story of that backpacker? Well, what would you have said if I told you David was the father? Right. Exactly. Sorry, but what would we have said? Probably that it was for the best if you got rid of it. I always get the feeling that I'm not up to scratch on all fronts. Why? Because Sam and your brothers went to college, make a lot of money... and you always lagged behind. - Oh, come on. - No, let me. That isn't the way I see it, it's how you've always seen it yourself. But you have a talent for living. More so than the other three. Noa is lucky with you. Look at how strong she is. It's because of those tons of love you pour over her. Sorry, sorry. That's not true. That's just bullshit. Is it? What do you think? That I work all the time because I enjoy it? We need money coming in each month. I think you're just trying to prove yourself to your father. - That makes no sense. - And why do you involve Sanne in this? - I didn't. - You did. She texted me to say you talked about it. No, I took her seriously. You should do that for once. Whoa. What? - I did things wrong? - I'm not saying that. - You are saying that. - Dammit. We have wonderful kids thanks to you for the most part. I know that. But what you normally do for them they had to do themselves now. And that went fine. They even enjoyed it. They can handle a bit more responsibility. Great. Then you take care of them. - And then you go back to work? - Whoa. Goddammit. Lau... If you were so unhappy, why didn't you say anything? And why didn't you go back to work? - I want to go home. - No. I want to go home. Now. Goddammit. Hey. Don't. Kasper, stop. Stop this. - What the hell? - I don't give a shit about work. You and me, Lau. Us and the kids is the only thing... The rest... Sams. - What are you doing here? - What do you think? - Got any cigarettes? - No. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. What did you do there, actually? I want to go to the children. Magnificent. For all those years I've been designing from a deep conviction... ...that a building has to bring people together. It's about people's paths crossing time and again... and what effect that has. I understood it better as an architect than as a father. Why didn't you tell me right away about Jan? Because we had to talk about us. We have not been happy for a long time. Lau... I don't want to go on anymore. I don't want us anymore. Noa? - Mom? - Yes? Honey, where are you? Where are David and Tammy? They're asleep. Is everything OK? Yes. Did you have fun today? - I want to be with you. - Oh, sweetie. Know what? Go back to bed and I'll read you a story. I'll ask David to bring you back early in the morning. Is that a good idea? 'We'll play a game,' the hare said. 'At the clearing'. He walked into the woods. 'What kind of game?' the owl asked. 'Well, we'll come up with it there.' 'Let's come up with a big game,' the hedgehog said. 'For all the animals'. Come on. 'The entire clearing is closed', said the hare. Look there. After all, we have done something good. You did. SHIT HAPPENS
