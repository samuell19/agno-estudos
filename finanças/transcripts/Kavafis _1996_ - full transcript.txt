Mr Sekopoulos, you are the person closest to him..... I'm sorry, but there is nothing we can do anymore I think it'd be wise to call the Greek Orthodox Patriarch My wife has already gone to inform him So, he was finally convinced to accept him I mentioned the name Mavroudis to him and he was very upset Is it true that Kavafis.....?
