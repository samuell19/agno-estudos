[WIND WHISTLING AND BELLS JINGLING] [♪] What a night! Christmas Eve. Don't you just love it? I do. Ha-ha-ha! Yeah. You probably figured it's the same old, same old. But this one's got a nutty little twist. [♪] SUGAR PLUM FAIRY: On a cold and snowy Christmas Eve, there was this girl named Marie. MARIE: Where are they? How can they leave me alone on Christmas Eve? Marie! It's freezing. You want us all to get sick? I'm sorry. I was looking for Mom and Dad. They should have been here hours ago. Mm, I wonder if they are coming. Well, of course they are! Uncle Drosselmeier! Uncle! Did you hear from them? It's the terrible storm that's making them late. What an awful Christmas this is going to be. Don't close your heart to Christmas, child! Why, it's the most wonderful time of the year. Wonderful? What's wonderful about it? I'm going to be spending Christmas Eve all alone. What's the big deal about Christmas, anyway? I just wish it would go away, forever! As long as the star is there to shine its light, Christmas will always be. [♪] Unh! Move over, would you? My foot's stuck. [GRUNTING] Give a girl some elbow room, will you? Heh! Man! What is it? What's going on? What's happenin'? Oh, my gosh! She wished there was no Christmas! I think I'm going to faint. [SWOONS] Oh! Oh, man. Why don't we do something to help that kid? Come on! It's academic, my macadamian friend. The girl is a human, and you are plain nuts. Mac's right. We got to help her. We just got to. Even if she's not a nut. Huh? Now, hold on there, Li'l Pea. Now, don't-- Don't you go runnin' off! [SCREAMS] [ALL GASP] Yeah, poor Li'l Pea. And just when he was starting to come out of his shell. [GRUNTING] How about one gift now, for the two of you? [GASPS] Wow! A new cannon? Thank you, uncle! [IMITATES CANNON FIRE] [GASPS] Oh, he's-- He's wonderful. [♪] Oh, is it him? Is it really, really him? Who? Where? Who? It is. It is. It is! Who? Where? Who? Yes, sir, it's true. Our gallant hero is among us again. I never thought I'd see the day. Will somebody tell me what's going on out there? [SCREAMS] There we go. Ah. That right there, boy, is the Nutcracker Prince. Or what's left of him. It all started long ago, before you'd even been planted. [VOICE ECHOING] Planted... Planted... STASH: You see, the Nutcracker Prince was in love with Princess Pirlipat, the most beautiful girl in the kingdom. MAC: .Yeah, but the old Mouse Queen, ha, she was a real shrew, and she was awful jealous of the princess. SPARKLE: And of the prince. She wanted our kingdom for herself. STASH: One day when the prince was away, the Mouse Queen gave the girl a terrible bite. And turned her into the all-time, absolute, u-ugliest thing that ever walked. Every man in the kingdom was called upon, for there was but one way to break the dreadful spell. How? How? How? By breakin' the hardest nut on the planet. Many tried and many failed. Except the Nutcracker Prince, who broke both the nut and the spell. STASH: And the princess was once again... [WOLF WHISTLES] ...if you get my drift. You mean they were nuts for each other? [SOBBING] Such a romantic story. But such a sad ending. [BLOWS NOSE] Oh, the prince was left so weak from the effort. That wicked old Mouse Queen, heh, she turned our poor prince into wood. Can you dig it? [SOBBING] A terrible loss for women everywhere. Yes, sir, there's only one force powerful enough to lift the curse on him. What is? What's powerful enough? Love. He's a wonderful Christmas gift, uncle. I'll keep him with me forever. Ah! but how is he in battle? Fritz! Is he brave and heroic? Fritz! Can he make quick decisions and give daring commands? Give him back! Stop! You'll hurt him! Oh. Oh, boy. Fritz! Come down from there! Fritz! Ow! [BOTH GASP] Look what you've done! I knew you were going to hurt him. I'm sorry, Marie. I didn't mean to-- Oh, just go away! Marie, you forget your brother is young. He didn't mean for it to happen. Oh, it doesn't matter really. I don't care about this dumb old nutcracker or Christmas. Or Mom and Dad not being here. Perhaps there is one more gift I might give her. Please forgive Fritz. He didn't mean to hurt you. Of all the gifts I've ever received, I love you the most. [YAWNS] [YAWNS] [♪] [NUTS SNORING] REGINALD: Just look at that deluxe assortment of nuts! Soon I will capture them all and command them to work in my cheese mines. Ha-ha-ha! Now this, as I'm sure you've guessed, is the bad guy of this tale, Reginald the Rat King. Hey, hey, hey! That's Mouse King! Not Rat King! That's Mouse King! Right. Anyway, Reginald is the son of that nasty old Mouse Queen, who turned our prince into a wooden nutcracker. Exactamundo. And now I am a supreme ruler of the Christmas kingdom! And all of Cheeseland!

What's wrong, Reginald? Cat got your tongue? You dare use that tone to me, Reginald, Mouse King? Soldier, sailor, lover! And soon to be ruler of the entire Christmas kingdom! En garde! [BOTH GRUNTING] [ALL GASP] Look, a shooting star! Where? Where? Come on, I wanna see it! Gotcha. Ha! ALL: Oh, no! You fool! You fall for the oldest trick in the book! Your shoe's untied.

Or I'm so small. [ALL GASP] Is there a problem? This has got to be the weirdest dream I've ever had. Princess, I can hardly believe it's you. Listen, would you mind pinching that? I need to wake up now. Ouch! Hey, that hurt! Cut it out! My apologies, princess. The name is Marie. Well, whoever you are, I owe you my life. The Mouse King would have killed me. That awful little rat, a king? You were marvelous! You go, girl! Yes, very grand. Quite so. You betcha! Uh-huh. Some kind of wonderful. Yes, sir. Hey, you know, they're nuts. Wait till you meet the squash. He's really out of his gourd. Friends, let's welcome Marie. She's broken the spell! Hip, hip-- ALL: Hooray! Hip, hip-- ALL: Hooray! Hip, hip-- ALL: Hooray! All right, baby! I broke the spell? Oh, yes! It was Reginald's mother who cast the spell that turned our prince to wood. You're kidding, right? Ever since then, that mean old Reginald has been acting like the king around here. That selfish Reginald has been tormenting us. Throwing us in jail, making us work in his cheese mines, calling us names, ringing our doorbells and running. He's a fiend, I tell ya. But now you've broken the spell. And our wonderful, kind, just and handsome prince has returned to rule again. So you rule over a bunch of groceries? He's prince of the produce. The big bun of the bakery. The king of candy. Mine are the people of the dessert. [ALL GROAN] Oh, ho-ho. Yuck! Oh, no! Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no-- no, no, no, no. No, no! The star. Just look at the star. Look, look, look! But I don't see it. Because it's not there! Oh, man. Oh, man. If there's no star to shine its light... Then Christmas will be gone forever. This is horrible. No, this is mega-terrible horrible combined. Is there a problem? The Christmas star has been guiding this kingdom since it began. Now it's gone! [FOODS SOBBING] You mean this Christmas star? [ALL GASP AND CHEER] It fell when she fell. I think I'm going to faint. [SWOONS] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to endanger your kingdom. I mess up everything! No wonder Mom and Dad didn't want to be home for Christmas. It's much worse than that, I'm afraid. If we don't get that star back on the tree by midnight, there will be no Christmas for anyone. No Christmas? Why, it wouldn't be Christmas without it. We gotta have Christmas! What'll we do? We can't not have Christmas! Where do we go from here? Like, what do we do now? Tell us what to do. It's simple. We return the star to the top of the tree. By midnight? That's only two hours, more or less, as the crow flies. It's impossible! Nothing is impossible when you believe it can happen and have faith. We'll climb to the top of the Christmas kingdom to the castle of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Of course. She'll help us get the star back in place. Sure! She'll know what to do. Why didn't you think of that? Come on, everybody! We have a long way to go and little time to get there. Out of my way! One side! Coming through! Make way! Watch your back. Women and citrus first. My friends, please! We have to work together. We have to help each other! He's right. Oh, it's true. Out of my way! One side! Coming through! Make way! Watch your back. Women and citrus first!

Such a delightful way of displaying her affection. She has pluck, she has spunk and she has the Christmas star. Where is she? Where is she? Uh, well, there is word, sir, that, uh, she heads to the Christmas kingdom in the company of the prince. She's with nut boy? How can that be? Find her! Bring her to me. She will be my queen! Or I will squish you all into tiny little cheese balls. Understand? VEGETABLE: Oh, prince, stop! You're going the wrong way! No, you are! He says "this way." He says "that way." Who said "which way"?

I stand corrected. Can you help us get the star back in place? You got the wrong broad. You have the answer right here. Eh, we do? Where? Yeah? Uh, where? Right here. Her? Me? How? Don't ask how. The Christmas star has powers we will never understand. But somehow, it always finds a way to shine. And its light grows brighter with every kind thought, every caring word and every good deed. Do you think it has the power to bring Mom and Dad home? I had hoped you'd stay, stay and help me rule the kingdom. Oh, I'd really love to stay, but I can't. I'll always be with you. [BELL TOLLS] Midnight! Well, what are we waiting for? Just visualize it back at the top and give it a toss! Go ahead, doll. Throw it up there! Have faith, and it will turn out just swell!
