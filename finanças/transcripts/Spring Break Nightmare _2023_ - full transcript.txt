I was watching that. You wouldn't have to if you were there. I know. I'm sorry, baby. I know, work. Okay, come on, my mom wants to make a toast. Hey, hey, wait, wait wait wait. Congratulations. A top 10 spot means turning pro, getting sponsorships. Okay, can we at least celebrate a little bit before you start counting your half of the divorce settlement. Oh, so now we're getting a divorce? Prove me wrong. I'm sorry, baby, I gotta take this. Work. Hello. Hi, everybody. - Hi. - Hi. Aw, thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, if everybody would gather around, I'd like to give a speech to my beautiful daughter. Oh, before you say anything, may I? Kayla, I should hate you, but I love you. You're my best friend, and you shredded out there. But just know that I'm not gonna sit back and let you take my number one ranking without a fight, so... Okay, okay, thank you. Nick? Uh. Kayla, baby. They said the odds were against you, but you won. I knew you could do it. I'm very proud of you, baby. Okay, I'd like to thank you all so much for being here for Kayla, and I know everyone is calling this an upset, but it wasn't to me. We all know how hard Kayla has worked to get here and for how long, from watching her dad compete from the beach, to surfing alongside him and winning her very first competition. I am so proud of you, sweetheart, and I know your dad would be too. My surf sensei. To my beautiful daughter! To winning the Nekton Championship next! No, girl, next is the awesome beach house Sarah found us such a good deal on. Yes. It's super fancy, and of course, I found it. Wow, doesn't that sound fun? Did you know about this? I wasn't invited. But you're Kayla's best friend. Yeah, I thought so too. I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it. No. She's just been busy. Aw, honey. So, you're renting a house? Just so Ally and I can recharge and train. You mean party. Mom, no, it's not like that. You don't think I know what spring break is. I know you girls wanna celebrate, but right now is really the time to stay focused. The Nekton Championship is the last contest of the season. I just want you to have a plan in place in case things don't go your way. You don't think I can win? Of course I do, honey, but not if you're off partying when you should be training. And applying to schools. Okay, I said I'd look into schools after Nekton. This could be my chance to go pro. Why don't you just stay here and train? What, with you? Yeah. We live right next to the ocean, and you haven't gotten in the water since Dad died. He would have wanted me to win. Your father wanted more for you than just surfing, Kayla. And, I just, I want you to have options. After I win, I'll have plenty of options. Sponsors, I could be a brand ambassador. Those aren't the options I'm talking about, and you know it. Just because you won today doesn't mean you'll win tomorrow. I mean, your dad knew that, even after he went pro, he never stopped trying to better his life. And ours. I just want some downtime to hang out with my friends and relax, it's not that big of a deal. I understand, okay? I get it. I do, okay? But I really think that you should bring Becky. Mom, why? Honey, she's your best friend. She doesn't even surf. Neither does Sarah. Okay, well, Sarah's Ally's friend. Well, this way, they can't team up on you. Fine. But don't go texting her the whole time, or I'll have her block your number. You wouldn't dare. Wanna bet? Can I go enjoy my party now? Yes, go. You're welcome. Thank you. I cannot decide. Hat or no hat? Hat. Oh, we're so excited you could make it, Becky. Yeah. Hey, are you still talking with Evan? Are you kidding me? No, no. It was so good to see you again, Miss Miller. It was good to see you too, Becky. You all packed up? Yeah, we're just waiting on Kayla. She talking to Nick? Yeah, saying goodbye. Do you like him? Kayla does. Hm. I will. Okay, bye. Nick says hi. - You ready? - Yeah. All right, let's go! - Bye, Miss Miller. - Bye, Becky. Hurry. Okay, I'll be right out. Honey, before you go, will you please just take these and look over them whenever you get a chance. Maybe ask Becky for help. I know she just got accepted to... Mom, I know you're worried. I promise I'll look through them as soon as I get back. Okay. All right, you win. Come here. Oh my God. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. That's what we need. Let's go! Okay, I'm coming. Thank you. All right. I love you, sweetheart. If we go any slower, we're never gonna get there. I'll miss you. Be safe, okay. I will. Bye, girls. Be safe. Have fun.

You just have to have one, okay. What is that supposed to mean? I can have other kinds of fun. - Pour. - Maybe later. Later? Come on, no, right now. Becky! Get wrecky! Oh my goodness. I'm gonna party, just not right now. I like to take it slow. Well, not too slow 'cause there's a lot of hot guys and you know it's not spring break unless you break a couple springs. Okay, all right. Okay, okay, okay. Why don't y'all go find your rooms. I don't think they like me. What? No, that's just how they are. Besides, they're just here to party any way. What about you? Maybe a little, but I'm here to rest. Now, let's go find your room. - Okay. - Come on. My parents were leaving the football game and this drunk guy slaps my mom's butt. I know, and my dad was like, "Hey, man, that's my wife." And he was like, "What are you gonna do about it?" My dad goes, please and head butts him. Okay, the guy passes out and he's like bleeding. I know and then he got arrested and we got sued for $2000. It's illegal to assault somebody. Yeah, so that makes sense. I know, right? Kayla, how about a surf before you go out? Surf, yes. Go out, no. You're just gonna lie around and text with Nick all night. That's why I'm here. Hey! He doesn't need to know where you are every minute of every day. You gotta leave a little mystery. Okay, no, not tonight. No, not tonight. Can I please have my phone? Your mommy texted you. On second thought, it might be fun to go out tonight. Okay, let's get you in something hot. Please. Come on. I have extra miniskirts. Let's go. I wanna do your makeup, too. Okay, okay. I gotta put you in a miniskirt, Becky. Are you okay? Did my mom tell you to ask me that? No, I'm just asking. I'm fine, I'm gonna go surfing and then I'm going out tonight. Do you mind if I tag along, too? Of course I don't. I'm sorry I snapped at you. I really am glad that you're here. Now let's go get ready. - Yeah. - Go. Let's get some selfies. Okay. Ready? I just can't get the right one. Are we allowed to be on this part of the beach? Who cares? Hi. Looks like somebody finally found our spot. Hey. How's it going? And it looks like they know what they're doing. Yeah, well, they're pro surfers. That's Kayla Miller and Ally Gates. So I'm guessing you all aren't from around here. Oh, no. Maybe we should head out. We're here for spring break. Yeah, I'm Sarah, this is Becky. Hi. I'm Zeke, this is Dean. Hi. Hi. Hey, so we're actually having a bonfire. Oh, I love parties. Yeah, totally. And you should, I don't know, bring your friends. It's right down the beach. You guys should show tonight. I mean, if you're lucky, we'll see. Okay. Okay, well, maybe we'll see you guys around. - See ya. - Yeah. Bye. Yeah, we're definitely going. You should come. Yeah, no, I'm gonna go. Okay, it's decided. Hey mom, what's up? Hey, getting some rest? I was. That's good. Well, you sound distracted. I'm just getting ready to go out. Kayla, I know I can't expect you to behave like a nun while you're there. Mom. Did you get a chance to look at that stuff I put in your suitcase? Mom, it hasn't been a day yet. Yes, I'm looking at them right now and no, I haven't even opened them yet. I came here to rest. But you know what? Now, I think I'll go out and blow off some steam. Okay, okay. I mean, it's spring break, right? Kayla, I didn't want to start a fight with you. This is my fault. It is all your fault. Since dad died, you've been breathing down my neck. He would understand. Just go have fun, okay. I'll call you tomorrow. Hey! You can have it back when you decide to have fun. The car's waiting. Yeah come on. Let's go. Come on, let's go. - Come on. - I'm coming. Wow, okay. Let's do shots, let's do shots. Come on. No, no. Yes, yes. Just do one shot. Yo. Hey ladies. - Hola. - Welcome. You made it. Cheers. Yeah. - Where's your drink? - I don't drink. Kayla right? Uh, yeah. Saw you out on the waves today, you can really shred. So you followed us? Sarah, right? Can I show you something for a second? Okay. What are you doing? - Wow. - Okay That's fast. What's going on? How long are you guys here for? Like a week. Yeah. - A week. - Yeah, like a week. Cool. Maybe I'll see you around, hang out more. We should totally shred some gnar. - Uh, we'll see. - Yeah, we're good. We'll see. Can I get you a drink? - Um, I'm good. - He's so cute, just go. I'm good, I'm good. Okay. Woo! Yeah, it's actually Venus actually brings a very feminine energy. Oh wow. Hey everybody check it out. What do you say that we get out of here and we go someplace where we can really party? Yes. Yeah, yes. - Becky! - For God's sake, somewhere where we can get Becky a drink. - Yeah. - Come on, Becky! You okay? I think I'm gonna go but you can stay, it's okay. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go. You okay? Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I just, I'm just gonna walk. I think, um. I just didn't really want to drink, so you know? Yeah. I will call a car. Ally has my phone. I will be right back. Okay. I had my fun. Phone please. No, let me... - Thank you. - Please. No, I'm gonna head out. You should leave. Bye Sarah. Wait, wait. Stay. Please. Becky doesn't feel well. Put her in a car. Stay. The cute one likes you. Okay, okay, okay. It's late and we wanna surf early in the morning, isn't that why we're here? Relax. Celebrate. Do you not want me to train? What? No, I don't care. You don't want me to win. No, of course not, but I'd still be happy if you did. Okay, okay, real nice Ally. I'm gonna go, have fun. Be safe. Or, I don't care. Wait, early surf in the morning? Sure. You know what, I think I kind of wanna walk. Okay, yeah, I'll walk with you. Oh, okay. K. Yeah. Thanks for walking. I just could not get in a car until my stomach settled. You're fine, it's not even that far. Are you feeling any better? Yeah. Thanks. How about you? Me? No, I'm fine. I didn't even drink tonight. I know, I guess I meant, well, I'm worried about you. Okay. You don't need to worry about me. No one needs to worry about me. I know, it's just that ever since you've been winning, you've been different. Since I'm actually succeeding at something I love. And it's great but, are we even still going to college together because I already got accepted and you haven't even asked me about it. Have you even applied yet? You sound just like my mom. What if I don't even want to go to college? Is that why you didn't invite me? No Becky. This is why I didn't invite you. You're only here because my mom told me to invite you and now I see why. Where are you going? To be alone, I'll see you at the house. Becky! Let me go. Becky? Come on, man! Let's go! Help me! Get her legs! Shut up! You don't think she's dead, do you? You better hope she is or we're screwed. She saw your face. Man, what happened? All you were supposed to do was get her drunk and bring her here. I tried. She was pretty damn sober when I got her in the van. But you didn't have to hit her. Hey, that is your fault. I did my part. She's awake. What are you doing? Your mask. There's no point. Thanks to you. Good luck proving whatever it is that you think you know. But just in case if you try, we will come for you and your mom. We will always be watching you. Nobody can protect you. Do you understand? Come on. Come on, hurry. Hey Becky, it's Michelle, just calling to check in. I was hoping to hear from Kayla this morning. Hope you girls are having fun. Nick, hi. Sorry to bother you, it's Michelle. I was just calling to see if you've heard from Kayla this morning. Give me a call when you get this. Please. Hello. Hey there Ally. Good morning. Ms. Miller. What time is it? It's 9:15. I was calling to see if you were with Kayla, but I guess if you've just woken up, you're not. Yeah, I haven't seen her since last night. I'll go look. Can you go grab her for me? She's not picking up her phone. Kayla? Becky? Sarah? Hello? Hold on, let me go look. Is anybody home? Kayla, it's mommy. She's not here, the bed's made. What about Becky? I can't get in touch with her either. I'm the only one here but maybe they went to breakfast. What about Kayla's jeep? Is it there? It's still here but we're supposed to surf this morning. So maybe she got a headstart. Well, can you go check? Sure. No, her board's here too. Hello? Send me the address. Now. - Ms. Miller. - Hi, Nick. I'm sorry, I came over as soon as I got the voicemail. Has Kayla called or texted you since last night? No, I haven't heard from her. All right. Well, I'm headed out right now. If anything has happened to her, Nick, I could never forgive myself. She's all I have left, Nick. Let's go find her. You're coming too? Yeah, I'll drive. You can call hospitals, check with friends. Anything else we need. Thank you Nick. Hey, I care about her too, okay. We'll find her. Okay. Hey, Ally, it's Michelle. I just was calling to see if you've heard from Kayla. I understand, I'm upset too. Finally yes, yes. I was calling to see if you had a young woman admitted last night. That was a known risk. Her name is Kayla Miller. I'm a little busy right now. What about any Jane Does? I will take care of it. I'm sorry too. Yes, I'll hold, Yes, I'll hold. Yes, I'll hold. That's the third time. How hard is it to run a search on a computer? Nothing. Pull in here. Wait, Ms. Miller. Police? I mean, do we have anything to tell them? No, but it's worth checking. Okay, um. - I'll go with you. - Okay, okay. This is work, I gotta take this. I'm sorry Ms. Miller. Okay, just keep trying to get in touch with Kayla or anybody else, okay. Yeah. This is Nick. Yeah, no, I understand, I'm upset too. Hi, I'm here to report a missing person. Can you help me? Has it been 48 hours? No, no, but it's not like my daughter to just disappear and not return phone calls from me or her friends. Ma'am, that's one thing movies get right. I understand it's spring break. Your daughter missed curfew and you're a little worried. Fill this form out and if we hear from her, we'll be in touch. Excuse me, Officer Poulet, I'm more than just a little worried, okay. It's not like my daughter to just vanish. She is a responsible girl. Ma'am, have you considered that maybe your daughter doesn't wanna be found just yet? A lot of these kids come here to escape overbearing parents. That's not what this is. 99 times out of 100 they show up here with regrets from the night before. What about the 100th time, what happens then? Can I speak to the chief please? He's on vacation. Of course he is. Ma'am, stop right there. Ma'am, what are you doing? Stop, you cannot go back there. Hey, hey, back up. Up against the wall. Have you seen this girl? Up against the wall. You wanna go to jail? You wanna get locked up? Ma'am! Ma'am! Hey, have you seen this girl? Have you seen her? Have you seen her? Have you seen this girl? Have you seen this girl? Have you seen her? Have you seen her? Hey, hey. Have you seen this girl? Have you seen this girl? Have you seen this girl? Have you seen her? Have you seen this girl? Have you seen her? Have you seen her? Ms. Miller? Sarah. Sarah, Sarah, hey, where's Kayla? Where's Kayla? I'm not her mom. Sarah, I need you to focus right now. When was the last time you remember seeing Kayla? Are you here to bail me out? Sarah, listen to me, I will, I will bail you out if you tell me where Kayla is. Tell me everything that you remember. When was the last time you remember seeing Kayla? Boardwalk. She was at the boardwalk, okay. And then what Sarah? Then what? Am I in trouble? Listen to me, listen to me. When was the last time you remember seeing Kayla? What happened? She was supposed to leave with me and... And then leave with who? The hot guys at the beach. Hot guys, what guys? Ma'am. Sarah, who are they? How did you get back here? Just tell me. This way. This way now. Right now, before you get in the tank. Call your mom! Let's go! - Go now. - Please. - She was with my daughter. - Let's go now. You wanna be in there with her? Oh, sorry. Is everything okay? No, my daughter is missing and someone in there knows something. She needs to leave or she is going to be detained, Detective Fisher. She doesn't seem like that much of a threat to society, okay. Just a worried mom. I can take it from here, thank you, Poulet. Yeah, you're lucky. All right, come on miss. Miller. Congratulations Ms. Miller, you're the only one that's made it that far past Poulet. Let's talk outside, see if I can help find your daughter. Thank you. Thank you. I understand your concern but this kind of thing happens around spring break. Just text me a photo of Kayla and let me know if there's anything else I can do to help. Well you can start by questioning Sarah back there in the drunk tank. She was with Kayla last night. Okay, I'll talk to her and see what she says, okay? Okay. Call me if you hear anything. I will. Thank you detective. Find anything? No, but Sarah is in there. - Sarah? - Yeah. Let's go. Did she say anything? Just that Kayla left with some guys. Have you heard from Ally yet? Not yet. Okay, then let's go to the rental. Hopefully she's there. I'll go around back. Ally, Ally? Ally, are you here? Becky? Oh. Sorry. Is everyone okay? Sorry, I was in the shower. I left it open for you. Have you heard from Sarah, I can't get a hold of her. She's fine. - Where is she? - Jail. What? Which room is Kayla's? Upstairs top floor. Where's Ally? She's in there. Okay, Ally I need you to try to tell me every... What? Oh my God, your back. Yeah that, I fell in the water and hit a reef. We went surfing and then to this whole beach party thing. But it was like super lame so then we left. Yeah, Sarah mentioned some hot guys. They're not that hot. Who were they I don't know. Just like locals. Do you know their names? I didn't catch them. They took us to the boardwalk and that's where I saw Kayla and Becky last. Would you recognize them if you saw them again? Probably. Okay, we're gonna retrace Kayla's steps. Go to the boardwalk, look for surveillance cameras, anything. You stay here in case they come back. Yeah sure. Come on Ally, let's go. Okay, hold on my hair isn't done. Oh, Becky's mom is calling me back. Hello. You have? She texted? Okay, yeah, yeah. I'd appreciate that. Thank you. Okay, bye-bye. Becky's at brunch with friends. She does not have any other friends. Ally, stop it. This is serious. Something is going on, I can feel it. Tell me about these guys again. I don't know, they were just guys. They brought us here, we got drinks. Kayla was with one of them like a lot though. He had like a really stupid name but he was kinda cute. Wait, you think that Kayla would cheat on Nick? That's not like her at all. They've had their issues. Don't all relationships? Ally, listen to me, you have to tell me everything that you know. Do you understand me? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, we were here and then they left that way and that's the last time that I saw her. Maybe they have security cameras. Let's see if they have footage, come on. Should we talk to like a manager or something? I don't know. Hi, do you guys need some quarters? No, sorry. I saw that you have security cameras outside. I wanted to see if you could show us the footage from last night. I really shouldn't. It won't take long and you could really help us, please. I'll have to call the owner Are you sure you have to make that call? Please we're really in a hurry. You guys can play some games as we wait. How many tickets would I have to win to see that footage? I just, I really wanna see it. Okay, come on back, I'll bring it up. This takes you back, this goes forward. Okay. Yeah, go back, go back. I think it was around midnight. That's her. It's them, it's Kayla. What is she doing? Wait, who's she trying to call? Wait, I think I know. She was calling a car, rental guy. We have to go now. Come on, let's hurry. Thank you. Good luck. - This is the place? - Yeah. So the guy's name is Harold? - I think so. - Okay. Hi, are you Harold? Yeah. Oh, hey, Ally, right? Hey, yeah. Hi, can we come in? We could really use your help. I can't. Please. All right, whatever. Hi. How do you track your customers? Phone number. Do you mind, will you check? Please. I can't be doing that. Please, it's my daughter. She's missing and I think she called for a car last night. It's not gonna look good for your business if we don't find her. Please. All right. Nope, sorry. Girls, I can't be doing this. Please just... Can I check please? Oh, got a hit on that number last night. Actually, this morning, destination was 167 Cliffside drive. That's you. No rider at pick up though. What do you mean? I'll show you. See, I record everything. After a few incidents, I installed cameras in all my cars. Here's the pick up. Okay, I got it. Let's go. Come on. I hope this helped. If you need anything else, just ask. This is where Harold's driver was called. They must have walked here from the bar. Where was she last night? We were on the beach somewhere. There was a bornfire. Where was the bonfire Ally? It was around here, I don't know, it was late. Which way did you guys leave? Which way did you go? I think it was around here. I can't remember. Just keep looking for her. Kayla? Oh my God. Kayla?! Kayla?! What is it? What is it? Ms. Miller. This is my fault. Hey, hey, this is not your fault, okay. Look at me. She wouldn't have even been here if it wasn't for me. Ms. Miller, you didn't do this to her. We're gonna get whoever did. Do you think she was killed? She could have fallen, it's hard to say. She texted her mom this morning. We know, we're contacting her parents. I spoke with Kayla's friend, Sarah Swan like you asked. Got some coffee in her. She seemed sober but scared. Do the names Zeke or Dean mean anything to you? Yeah, that's them. Who are they? We're looking into it but first names only is not much to go on. Unless you have some more information. They were buying a lot of drinks. So that's basically all I remember. It seems that Sarah was told to keep Kayla close. It's starting to look like maybe your daughter was targeted and maybe Becky just got in the way. What? Best thing that you can do right now is go somewhere safe and be near your phone. And if anything new comes up, you call me, okay? Right away. You just fine my daughter, please. I'll take you back. Is that Kayla's phone? Yeah, I'm just scrolling through it to see if I can find anything. Any kind of clue, anything. Something Detective Fisher said got me thinking. Who would target Kayla? Do we know she was targeted? Do we? What's that supposed to mean? Your trip, your plan. Michelle. And conveniently you lose track of Kayla right before she disappears and you didn't even go check on her after you guys had been drinking. Isn't that what a best friend would do? It was late, I thought that she was asleep. So you just passed out? Are you seriously blaming me for this? She left me probably 'cause she was pissed at you. Hey, this is no way to help Kayla and why would she be helping us if she was involved? So let's all just take a breath and figure out our next steps. We're supposed to stay put but I don't trust these cops to move fast enough. We've already lost so much time. You want us to find her ourselves in this city? We have to do something. Oh my God. An unknown number? What do I do? Answer it. Hello? Mom! Kayla, baby? Kayla where are you? - Are you okay? - Shut up. Just shut up. Just listen. Your daughter is alive. If you want her to stay that way... I'll, I'll do anything. If you speak again, she dies, okay. If you go to the cops again, she dies. If you don't leave now, tonight, she dies. We're watching you. You say that you'll do anything for her. If you wanna see Kayla in one piece again, you'll do nothing. Or else. Oh my God. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay, she's alive. She's alive. Look at me, look at me. She's alive. She's alive. Look, if she's still alive, it means she can still come home. What do we do, call the cops, trace the number? No, no cops. You heard them. Do you really think they can be watching us that closely? It's possible. We can't just leave. We're not leaving. Should we call the detective? Do you really want to risk that? Doing nothing is not an option. Kayla is alive but she's in trouble. So I won't call the police. What do you wanna do? I'm gonna head out of town first thing in the morning. What? If they're watching us that closely, I want it to look like I'm doing exactly what they asked. But don't worry, I'm gonna make a stop along the way. Hey. Hey, you're gonna be okay. Okay, just calm down or you're gonna get yourself hurt. Look, if you promise not to scream I won't put the gag back in. You killed Becky. It was an accident. No one was supposed to get hurt. You kidnapped me. We were just supposed to go out and have fun. Does it look like I'm having fun to you? Please, just let me go. Look, if you just hold on, I promise you're gonna be okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. What about Dean? Hey Zeke. Can I talk to you for a minute? Just out here. What do you think this is man? Play time? You're not on a date with her anymore. I know, but you don't have to treat her like that, okay. She's here, all right, we've got her. So all we have to do is wait and then let her go. No, that was the plan, man. That was the plan until you decided to commit murder. Okay, whoa, that was an accident. You know that. Oh, you think that's how a jury is gonna see it? You think that's how she sees it? Bro, don't you understand? We can't ever let her go. Not after what you've done. All we gotta do is dump her, okay and get out of here. I mean, she's hurt, she can't even compete. What, and trust her to keep her mouth shut? Look, I can talk to her, I'll explain. She likes me. Wait, you think she likes you? Zeke, Zeke, you murdered her best friend. Zeke, look at me. Let me be very clear here, dude. She's not your friend. Now I need you on my side, okay Zeke? Look, buddy, we're just gonna stick to the plan and be ready on schedule, okay? What's going on? She's going to the cops. Come on. Hey, hey. Hey, Dean! Detective Fisher, I found my daughter. Miss Miller, hi. She's... Hello? It's your daughter. Put it on speaker. Hi, mom. Hi, honey. Sweetie, I'm here with Detective Fisher. Hi Kayla, I've heard a lot about you. Is everything okay? Yeah. Glad I caught you. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I lost my phone... after I got separated from Becky. Sorry, I'm just finding out about it. Well rest assured Kayla. We'll find out who hurt your friend, okay? Okay. And Kayla? Where are you right now? The rental. I mean the beach, the beach near the rental. Yeah, we're leaving town today. Too much excitement. The girls just wanted one last day at the beach to say farewell to Becky. Kayla honey is there anything else that you needed? Just, thank you detective. Sorry for all the trouble at the beach. Please don't be. I'm just glad to hear that you're okay. Okay, well, it was good to see you Detective Fisher. I should get going. I'm gonna take you off speaker phone now. Okay, honey? Bye. Kayla? You just don't listen, do you? You talk to him again and she dies. We're watching. Are you trying to get us caught, huh? I swear to God if he comes sniffing around for you. Hey, that's enough. I told you to stay out of it. Just stay away from her. What are you trying to do, huh? Oh, yeah, you're gonna try to rescue her? Let me go. I'm done man. I'm done, I'm done waiting for the cops to show up, man because her mom's not gonna quit. We have to move her. But the plan is to wait. I'm not getting caught and I didn't kill that girl. Do you understand? You did, you killed her. Dean! Dean! She's gone. Find her. Find her! Kayla! Kayla! Move. We're going on a trip. There we go. They knew, they knew. How did they know? What? Can we go through your night again? We went to the bar. She left, that's what happened. Until what time? This is pointless. Are you telling them what we're doing? I'm not, I'm not doing this with you again. So it was just a coincidence that they called right when I went to go see Fisher? They could be tracking your phone. Your back. How did that happen again? I told you, surfing. Look, no reef rash. Did you get this when she fought back? Is this because she beat you? I fell, okay. Outside the bar, I fell. And I didn't want to tell you because I was drunk. I don't believe you. This entire trip was your idea. Did you plan this? No, Kayla's my best friend. You were her rival first. I would never do anything to Kayla. Let me see your phone. Give it to me. Fine, here. Why don't you read my texts from Kayla and get a good idea how she really feels about you. It's literally all she talks about. - Where is she? - You're crazy! Stop, stop, it's the detective. It's Fisher. I'll deal with him. Detective Fisher, hi again. Is this bad time? No, no, not at all. I was actually just headed out myself. Okay, I just figured I'd stop by and check in on Kayla and tie up some notes. I'm sorry. You just missed her. Oh, no kidding. Yeah, she went to surf county line. I thought you were leaving. This evening, She takes every chance she gets to train. She said she'd be back around four. Okay, I'll swing by around five and catch her before you leave. - Sounds like a plan. - Okay. It was good to see you again, Detective Fisher. You too. Thank you for stopping by. No problem. If you keep lying, he's gonna get suspicious. We have to figure out how they know what we're doing otherwise we can't be sure of anything. Maybe we talk with the neighbors. See if they've seen anybody weird looking around. We've only been here for a day, Nick. Wait, what about Sarah? Detective Fisher said that she knew more than she was saying. Would she talk to you? Yeah, I mean, she tells me everything, so. Nick would you go and pick her up from the station and bring her back here? I don't think they're gonna let me in after last time. Yeah, sure. Are you two gonna be okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too Ally. I just, I need to be alone right now. Are you gonna keep quiet? Yeah, you sure? There we go. Make yourself at home. I don't feel like defending myself again. Why don't you and me go for a walk, get some fresh air, talk things out. I'm good. I think I'll stay here. I was out of line Ally, I'm sorry. Please. Ally please. Fine, whatever. I would never hurt Kayla, okay. I don't know why you keep accusing me. Look if we want to find her, we have to work together. - We cannot be... - Stop, listen. We're being watched. There's a camera in Kayla's room. What? We have to get out of here. No, no, no, stop, don't react. Do you think Harold? He said it himself, he records everything. It must be how they know what we're doing. They've been watching us this entire time. What do you want to do? We're gonna go back to Harold's. And this time we're going to find out what he really knows. And I'm gonna get my daughter back. Come on. I think your detective friend is following us. We have to lose him. Go, go, go, go, go! I think we lost him. Zeke, it's almost time. Get ready to move. All right sweetheart, time for a... Help! Help! Someone! Zeke, Zeke. She's getting away! Help! Kayla stop. Kayla, Kayla. Kayla stop. Don't. Kayla, don't. She's heading for the back. Hurry before she gets by. Get her legs! Help! Help! Help! Come on Kayla, you shouldn't have done that. Stop. No! Stop. Stop. Stop fighting. You don't have to do this. Yeah, I do. No, no, stop. Creel Motors. I found the cameras. I have video of my daughter. I know where you are and I am coming after you. You screwed with the wrong family. How was that? Threatening enough? Convinced me, yeah. I'm gonna go in. Let me go with you. Stay here, and if you have to, call 911, okay? They said not to. Michelle. Stay here. What are you doing here? Where is my daughter? I know you know. I already told you, I don't know where she is. I found the cameras. There's a perfectly reasonable explanation for that. Well, then you can explain it to me or the police. Which is it? Kayla, Kayla! I told you Ms. Miller. I already told you, I don't know where she is. Kayla! I really wanna help you in any way that I can if I can. But I didn't know about your daughter going missing until you came in yesterday. It's all documented here. So what is all this stuff? Are you some kind of pervert or something? Do I look like a pervert to you? People steal stuff, I'm just protecting my business. So you record everything right? Yeah. Well, I mean not everything, but. The cameras are there for security purposes only. All the footage comes here and just so you know, I'm the only one that has access to it. So you can pull up all the footage from Kayla's rental house. I will show you anything you wanna see. Let's just please keep the police out of this. All of this stays between you and me if you just help me find my daughter. Deal. Ally, it's okay. Harold's gonna help us, right Harold? In any way that I can. Have a seat. Yeah all right, so. Yo Dean, he's here. Finally. Nick? Nick? What the hell happened? No one was supposed to get hurt. It wasn't as easy as you said it would be. Okay, give me a minute. Hey, are you okay? I don't understand. Why are you here? This is complicated. Are you taking me home? Of course. Right after Nekton. Hey, listen, I'm in a lot of trouble and I made some very bad bets. Baby, I just lost everything when you beat Ally and then I bet on her again for Nekton. And so I just need some insurance. You bet against me? These people, they are very bad people, okay. And this is the only way. Trust me. No, Nick, Nick. Nick. Where's Dean? He's up top. I don't even know what I'm looking for. Just keep going back. Keep going back. There, there, play it. Renters? No. Hold on, hold on. Stop, stop, stop, stop. That's them. Those are the guys from the party. They followed her. She was targeted. Keep playing it. I totally know that van, dude. I know that van. Belongs to a guy named Dean. Him and his buddy Zeke rent out mommy's yacht for parties. Where? My bet's they're at Hoffman shipyard. They're not exactly a legit business. So they don't dock at a marina. Hoffman. Let's go. I'll send you a pin. Hey, good luck. I mean it. I'm taking this. It's on the house. Hoffman, I knew that name sounded familiar. It's where Nick works. It came up with his caller ID. Have you heard from him since he left? Not since you told him to get Sarah, he hasn't been answering any of my texts. He showed up first thing so that he could be with me when Kayla went missing so he could know exactly what I was doing. They have had someone running this entire thing from the inside. It's him Ally. It's how they know where we are. They're not tracking our phones. I'm calling Fisher. Wait, don't you think we need proof this time? Let's get there and then call. Come on. Let's go. You shouldn't have come here Nick. Apparently I should have come sooner. Do you realize how many times you almost got us caught? Oh, I am literally the only one who has done their job. If you wanna blame someone, blame Zeke. He murdered that girl. And what about you? You were supposed to make sure that Sarah kept everybody close, but you couldn't do that. Could you? Now where is she? Or, um. Are we gonna have to make another stop. She is out and she knows nothing, I made sure of it. All right, all we have to do is keep Kayla here until after the competition and the bets clear. She can't compete if she's dead. That won't be necessary Things are different now, Nick, do you understand? She was never supposed to know who we are. - I know. - That part was crucial. I know. I know. Okay, um. The thing is, Nick, we don't have a choice. I know. I know. Even if we let her go now. I know. I know. I know. I know! Nick, we have to kill her. - No, no. - Yeah. No, wait a second I can talk to her. I can explain. No, man, you can't explain it. No. No more explaining, no more talking. Let me tell you what I told Zeke when I saw him catching feelings for your girl. There is no scenario in which she lives and we walk free. Do you get it Nick, any of us. Nick, Nick, where are you? Nick, I'm ready to go. Get rid of her. Nick? Come on. Sarah, hey. Hey, hey, hey, I told you to wait in the car. But you said you'd be quick. I know. Look. I'm really grateful you bailed me out, but I'm tired. I'm cooped up. I mean is Kayla in there or something? No, no, no, no. Hey baby. It's... Look, I told you it's for work, okay, and Kayla is done. You promise? Yeah. It's getting dark, let's get you out. Okay? I know but... And I'll be back later and we can chill all night long. You promise? I promise. I promise. We haven't spent any time together. I want seafood now. You can have whatever you want. Go get us some dinner. Ew, what is he doing? I knew he was a loser. Fisher. It's Nick. He's here, he's in on it. He's at Hoffman shipyard. No, Sarah. He said just to stay here. There's no time, I gotta go. Michelle, Michelle, wait. I'm gonna go save my daughter. Michelle, wait. Michelle. Stay here. Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? What are you doing? Move. Hey! Dean? What we should have done from the start. Dean! No, no! Please. No. No. Stop! That's a good girl. Oh come on, man. Come on. Put the knife down. Dean, Dean, please. Please, please, please, please just put the knife down. Move. Come on, man. You're gonna make so much worse than it already is. Please man. Please, I'm begging you. Just please put the knife down. Hey, whoa. Let her go. Zeke, buddy, look at me. I know you don't like this. Come on, come on man. All we have to do is run. Not if we wanna get paid. Zeke not if we wanna be free. Come on. I didn't sign up for this either, but I am not the one who is a killer here. I am not a killer. Oh yeah? What would Becky say to that? Shut up, shut up. Zeke, listen to me. We do this, that is erased. Do you understand? I am not a killer. Stop, hey. It's too late Nick. Too many loose ends, we need to cut our losses. Zeke, you pull that trigger, that's it. You might as well put that gun to your own head next. Just put it down and think this through man. Dean, give her to me. Give her to me, Dean. I mean, did you two both think this was all gonna end happily ever after for everybody? Somebody has to die. Not her. Zeke. Are you really willing to go to prison for this girl? Yes. I'm the only one that knows how to drive the boat. I'll figure it out. Kayla! Hey, hey. Don't. Baby, no, no, no. Don't, don't. Stay. Baby. This is all just for a bet? No, no, no, no, I did this for us. This is for our future. You have to believe this was for us. Did you ever actually love me? After the bets clear, we can do whatever we want. We can go wherever you want. I'm not going anywhere with you. I'm gonna walk out of here. You know I can't let you do that. Then you'll have to kill me. Get off of my daughter. Stay here. Don't. Kayla. - Kayla. - Kayla baby. Put down the gun. Put the gun down, Kayla. Baby, put it down. Kayla. Kayla. Kayla. Kayla just put it down. Put the gun down, baby. It's me. - Put the gun down. - It's me Kayla. Put it down, honey. Don't do this, okay. Listen to your mom. Don't do this, okay. Please. Listen to your mom. It's over, it's over. Stop. So it turns out Nick Sawyer was part of a gambling ring. He owed a bookie a lot of money and he bet against your daughter. So he wanted her out of the way? Ew, what a pig. Thank you for believing me, Detective Fisher. I'm sorry we were here so late. It's okay. How are you feeling, young lady? I'm sore, but I'm okay. Well, you have a very special mom. I know. She was like right on my tail. No, she wasn't, it was not that close you're better than you think. And you were awesome today at Nekton and totally deserved that win. Competition was a little slim without you. Don't get too excited. Today is just for fun. Yeah, right, it's on. Mom, we're ready to go. I'm coming. Look at this. Okay, so she was like coming right at me. And I was like, girl. Oh my gosh. Hot momma. Mom, you're actually gonna get in the water? Yeah. You haven't surfed since dad died. I know, but I figured it was time to change that. It's your last surf before your first semester and I really wanted to share that with you. It's not exactly my last surf. I'll get back out there. Hey, be careful. She is not quite easy to keep up with. Take it from me. Don't I know it. Mom come on. I'm right behind you.
