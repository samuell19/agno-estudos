During the restoration of the Altarpiece by Veit Stoss in Cracow, a yellow slipper was found. How did it get there? Who could it have belonged to? Could a worker wear shoes made of morocco leather? Could a grown man have a foot this small? Did he throw it behind the Altarpiece on purpose...? THE STORY OF THE YELLOW SLIPPERS Wawrzek! Wawrzek! You damn stray! Where are the cows? Again, with the pruning knife?! You'll get it now. You and that damn knife! Get back here, I tell you! I'll break all your bones at home! Grandma, grandma! Wawrzus, shouldn't you be with the cows? - I was... - What happened? The landlord plans to beat me up again. O, Jesus. I wanted to watch the cows, but they wandered off. - I found a huge root... - Climb up. - Sit still, don't move an inch. - Yes, Grandma. Wait. Take this. Go, go on up. Wawrzek! Is Wawrzek here? Good to see you! Won't you eat something? How about some milk? - Where is he? - Wawrzek? He keeps distracting himself with that stupid knife. I'll beat it out of him for good. The cows went and stomped the crop again. Wawrzek, get down here. Right now. I'm telling you, get down here. Please, sir, I won't do it again, please, spare me! Are you really going to beat him again? Grandma, grandma...! You'll remember this. I work hard from dawn until dusk and you play around with a knife. See what you've done to yourself. Did it hurt? No. No? Show me. You want to watch? Come on in. See Wawrzus, you can't keep doing this. The landlord told you not to take the pruning knife, - and you keep doing it anyway. - It wasn't me. Ah, the knife grew legs and followed you, did it? If you keep taking things you were told not to take, you will become a thief. And then they'll cut your hand or ear off. If you lie, they'll cut your tongue out. - That's the law. - But it wasn't me. What's this? A root? A cow, but it's missing its head. So, you were using the pruning knife! I was... But I didn't steal the knife off the table. Oh, you. See, you can help if you only try! Now, drink your milk and go herd the cows. It's time. See, a week has passed, everything calmed down. No issues with him. He's watching the cows well. Isn't that right, Wawrzus? He's watching the cows... He's playing with that knife again. Picking at a root instead of helping. What good could come of that? Can he make a living with it? Go now. Just go, go. He's a good child. So helpful and kind. Anyone would be, if you hit them with a belt. Kindness yields better results than anger. Kindness or belt, to each their own. The knife's gone! Burek! Why did you bring me the knife, doggy? You want me to get hit again? Every time you bring it, I get hit. I must watch the cows! Take it back, you hear me? Hey, cow, don't you like the grass? Eat it! Are you sure nobody saw you take it? Eat! Hey, kid, come here. Come! What are you looking for? Birds' nests? No. - Jasiek? - Yes? Hurry it up. We don't want to spend the night in a ditch instead of a tavern. - Did you give water to the horses? - I did. Hitch them up, then. How far are we from Cracow? - Where? - Cracow. I don't know. What are you staring at? Never seen a slipper? - What do you need that trunk for? - They'll make statues from it. - Statues? - Of Saints, for the altar. - That big?! - Three times your size! Did you take the cauldron? Is this your dog? Mine. But who will make those statues? - So clever. - Sir, who will be making the statues? Who will craft them? Who? The one that this sign belongs to. - Where will these statues stand? - Where the King lives, in Cracow. Get lost now, I have no time for this! Jasiek, we're leaving. You were supposed to be watching the cows! What are you staring at?! You damn stray, you! Can't even watch the cows! When I get you I'll break all your bones! Just you wait, you'll get it at home tonight! Malgos, get on the line! - A dog... - A dog? - It's dancing. - Dancing? Where? - A dog! - A dog. It's sitting... Play, play! It's trained... - Maybe we could... - Well, then... A boy. Well, then... Froncek! - Is that your dog? - Mine. Who are you? Where are you from? - From Poreba. - Where is that? - I don't know, we're lost. - Got lost with a dog? - Not a very good dog, then. - He's good. His name is Burek. A good dog, you say? - What do you want in exchange? - Nothing, we're together. We can take you, too. We're minstrels. You can learn all kinds of things from us, you can see the world! It's his dog. It's my dog! Did I ever say it wasn't his? I'm just asking if he wants to trade it. - He doesn't. - I don't. Stop butting in, keep practicing. If the wolves find you at night, your Burek won't help you! He will. We're leaving. Froncek, hitch the horses up already. Froncek! He'll help me! We're leaving. - A rope. - What rope? The dog. It could come in handy. It's a good dog, it can do tricks. They'll follow us. We're leaving! Who cares if they get eaten by wolves! That's right. - The horses! - They're ready. - Get up. - Yes, yes... - Where are you going? - That depends. We travel from town to town. Wherever there's festivities. - Why? - We perform for people. - Didn't you see? We're minstrels. - What are minstrels? We perform. On the road the whole year. We're heading to Cracow this Autumn. - Cracow? - That's where the King lives. - Are there big statues in Cracow? - What statues? Of Saints. They're supposed to be on an altar of some kind. I didn't see anything like that. Right, they're transporting the trunk right now. It's this big! - What is it for? - They'll make the statues out of them. From a trunk? Yes! With a pruning knife, only bigger than this one. - Are you going there? - Shush, don't say it so loud... - Malgos, we're leaving! - Coming! Meister Gregorius is calling. Follow us, you'll find a town, and then you can head to Cracow! You'll find the people transporting the trunk. Alright? Mayor and his assessors wish to warn us all. Turn your lights off, dear citizens! Turn your lights off! Turn your lights off! Turn your lights off! What a big city, Burek! The houses... - Who's walking outside at night? - I'm from Poreba. You better run home, or my dogs will get you! Your mum is waiting for you! Let me sleep! Don't be afraid, Burek. Don't be afraid. Quiet down! Help! Someone, help! Thief, thief! Somebody help me! Thief! Someone, please! Help me! Thief! - What's wrong, boy? - There was a thief chasing me! - Maciej, Maciej. - There, there, there. To the right. They robbed the church! Hold him tight! Come with us, Mikolaj! Where is he? - Who, the boy? - What boy? The thief! - You're asking us? - Right through here, Maciej. Look what I found under the fence! Who cares about that, better chase the thief! Dear Lord! They caught him! They caught him! - Come, we can't see anything! - Come closer! Here he is, the sacrilegist! We caught him in the street. Without a light! Silence! We found Holy objects by the fence. Do I deny the possibility of theft? But the thief has escaped, and you're accusing an innocent man. I'm but a servant of God, coming back from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. What were you doing in the street without a light? I was looking for a place to rest for the night. He doesn't look like a thief. To call a servant of God a thief...! - Maybe he really is a pilgrim? - He doesn't have the look of a thief! Let him go. Did you catch him in the act? Let him go. - Wait. - The boy saw the thief. Where's the boy? Burek, Burek! That's my dog. - Are you the one who saw the thief? - Yes. Burek, come here. The dog will be fine. We must catch the thief first. - This is the boy, sire. - Finally. Look closely. Do you know this man? No. It's clearly a child. Silence! This is serious. See? God Himself doesn't want me to be falsely accused. So, you didn't see him commit sacrilege? Of course I did. He was holding a bag in his teeth and was sliding down a rope. So why did you say you didn't know him? Because I don't know him. That was the first time I saw him. Look closely, maybe he's a different man after all. It's him, for sure. See for yourselves. The thief was missing his left ear. So, he's met an executioner before. You'll pay with your head this time around. It's definitely Black Raphael! Get him! Put him in a dungeon! I'll be seeing you again, little one. And you, too. Yes, surely. In another world, maybe! Legs straight. Legs straight! That's good. Did you ask where that Poreba of yours is? I asked, but no one knows, where that is. - Then you should stay with us. - Alright. Anyone can watch. You have to practice to actually do it! So, you're not going after those people with the statues anymore? Shush, don't say it so loudly. Look! Meisters of guilds of all kinds, craftsmen and their households! Youngsters of both sexes! And you, lords and their wives! Before we get to work, allow me... ...To fill my stomach a little. I have not had my breakfast yet today. He escaped. He escaped! Oh, Lord, what are we to do? He escaped! - Who? - The robber. He broke the bars and escaped. Black Raphael. We have to find him! The sacrilegist... He was supposed to lose his head in the morning! The dog is good. It's smart. The boy could come in handy, too. He's weird, keeps talking about that "Poreba". - He'll go back there. - He won't. - He will. - He won't. - He will. - He won't. He will. He'll see the big city, he'll take liking to the arts... Or maybe he won't. And if you perform your part well, people are happy and they clap! It feels nice when everyone's watching you and praising you. They don't mind giving you a bit of money then! And you know... Here. This is for you. Where did you find that? In the forest, in the grass. It resembles a horse, doesn't it? No, it's more of a dog. - But when you flip it so, it's a horse. - But this way it's a dog. Meister Gregorius took my knife away. I know. Give me a moment. What, is Meister afraid? I'm not. I just hope they don't close the gates in our faces. Giddy-up! Let me see. See, it's a magic knife. If you had one like that you could make real statues. No way. For the big statues you need an even bigger one. - Like this one? - Bigger! - Like this? - Give it to me. - Wait. - Let me. - Careful, don't break it. - I won't. Giddy-up! Malgos, hand me the safe-conduct. We're almost there. Hand me the knife. Look! - What a nice trunk! - Isn't it? You made it just in time for dinner. - Have a good night! - You too! Hand it to me. It's that trunk! Gate, gate! Open up. Open up! - Who are you? - Us? Minstrels! - Is the boy yours? - Ours, sire. - We have the safe-conduct. - It's getting late. - We'll let you in tomorrow. - But the safe-conduct...! Horses! You idiot... - Will they let us in? - They will, surely. Are we supposed to stand waiting at the gate? - So that a bandit can just... - ...murder us? Minstrels, you say? Show us something. Performance of some kind! What do you mean? Here, at the gate? What's stopping you? Meisters of guilds of all kinds, craftsmen and their households! Youngsters of both sexes! And you, lords and their wives! Before we get to work, allow me... ...To fill my stomach a little. I have not had my breakfast yet today. I don't like the taste this morning. What about this one? Or this one? I'll never find them. We'll find them tomorrow. And they're making statues from those trunks and I'm looking for them. - The mark on that trunk... - What if she falls? She won't. Look, the mark looked like this. There was a big trunk on that car, a linden tree. At the bottom of it was this mark. They rode through the gate. And then? Wawrzek! You'll take me there, then? Wawrzek, did you find out where they took that trunk? He's supposed to take me there after we've finished our performance. Hold this. Wait here for me. It's Burek's turn. Follow the dog. First the merchants and the nobles. Maybe they'll give us a ducat. - Keep smiling! - Friendly smile! Stand, Burek, very nice. For what? For what? - Wait here! - I will. Hold this. Yes, yes, yes. Meister, I saw the robber! He's dressed as a merchant. Stupid. You're seeing things. No, I'm sure of it. It was him! This city is full of cheapskates. Skinflints! Hey, you. You want to earn more? If you want to make more, follow me. Where? Is it a wedding? A feast, my lord? What do you require? Fire-eating, tightrope walking? I'll call my assistant. Froncek! No need. Come. You come, too. Who knows what this is about. - Can't Froncek come instead? - No, you're coming. Froncek needs to hide the money. No, I better take it with me. Listen, it's that one. He'll be back. Remember well. Hey, you! What are you doing? Get out of here. Yeah! Froncek, wake up. We have to gather a crowd. - Malgos, Malgos! - What? I need to tell you something! - I saw! - What? The statues! Why did you need to see me? You'll be King Balthasar. Here's a ducat. Many thanks. I told you I'd be seeing you. What happened? Black Raphael. Hey, wait! I'm telling you; I'll show up there every day. And when they kick me out, I'll come again. Won't you take me with you? Froncek! Where's Froncek? - What happened? - Get in, we're leaving! The dog, where's the dog? Froncek. Froncek! Hitch up the horses, we're leaving. Hitch them up! Get on! Hitch them up! Hitch them up! Giddy-up! Out of our way! Giddy-up! The children are asleep. How many were there? Around ten. Maybe fifteen, even! Maybe. Enough to have to run from Cracow? They'll just catch the bandit and hang him. Sure. They caught him back in Myslenice, too. They'll do it right this time. I value my life. He won't spare you, you know. - Me? - You. Giddy-up! Keep sleeping. Giddy-up! - What will you do there? - I'll whittle statues, just like them. - Will they let you? - I don't know. - Will you take Burek with you? - Of course! Me and Burek will always be together. What's wrong? We could escape together. What do you think? - Well? - No. I'm happy here. Go. Quietly! When I'm older... When I'm older, I'll come back for you. Good people, please, open the gate. Please, open the gate. Open up. Burek, Burek, come here. Open up, please! Who are you? Get out of here! Please, open it up, if only a little! I'm begging you. Sure. We're running down the stairs as we speak, all three of us. Get lost, kid. Come back tomorrow during the day, then you can enter like everyone else. - You should try the window! - I'll help you with a stick! Fine, my lord. Catch! What a squirrel! About those minstrels you asked about, Father... ...that performed in the town square... Where are you going, kid? The door is here. Thank you. They left yesterday evening. I won't be needing their assistance anymore. God bless you. Amen. Who's there? Why are you running around at night? See? You're all wet now! Whose are you? I'm Wojciech's, from Poreba. What Poreba? - There. - Wait. And the dog? - Is it yours? - Mine. - Where do you live in Cracow? - Nowhere. Nowhere? Then why are you looking around? A bandit was chasing me. - A bandit? - Yes. There are no bandits in Cracow. The King would order to catch him and cut his head or hand or ear. You're so troublesome. Come, I'll dry you out. Walking around the city at night, talking of bandits... Why are you always so sleepy, Wawrzus? If you take so long with every turnip, you'll never finish! You still have to bring wood from the shed. Close the window, it's cold! He'd spend the whole day by that window if he could. What are you even looking at, Wawrzus? Leave him be, Jagna. Wawrzek, tell us. Did he chase you again? Tried to strangle you? Leave the boy alone. He's always looking for that bandit of his, my Lady. He'll never catch you in here. But you better spend the nights sleeping, not walking around. Hurry it up, Wawrzus. Or you won't be done in time for dinner. How many do you have left? This again. You better fetch some wood. Meister, I have a little... What are you doing? Didn't they tell you to stay in the kitchens? Kitchens, kitchens. I was looking for some chips for tinder. You have enough in the shed. Why the long face, Burek? Didn't you want to come to Cracow? Are you sad? You miss Poreba, don't you? You'd even take the occasional beating. After that we'd just go to the forest with the cows. But they'd never let me carve there like they let me do here. Only at night. They have tools here. What do you know, anyway. If I catch you again I'll beat you so bad you won't even be able to pick yourselves up! Scoundrels, bandits! You've ripped the head of the rooster, that's not enough for you! And our wondrous council decides to give that man an order for an altarpiece. You should be the one making it, Meister Martin. - Or you, Meister Paul. - I saw the sketch. And I'm telling you: he's breaking all the rules! Defying all the canons. It's an insult to our craft! I'll tell you more: he gives his statues the faces of the members of his household. Desecration! You'll be praying to God on your knees, Meister Martin, facing Mother Mary, whose face is based on the glorified Meister's own wife! Heresy. Heresy and sloppiness. Let him carve roosters for taverns, not whole altarpieces. A rooster. Meister Veit. Good day, Meister Veit. So glad to see you in good health. We've been hearing news around the town. Apparently, the King wants to visit your workshop. To see your grand artwork. It's a great honour for our guild. All thanks to you, Meister Stoss. All thanks to you. You'll bring honour to our whole... One sends you in the morning, you'll come back in the eve. You probably went to the Wawel castle. - Did you see the king, Wawrzek? - He went to the market. To see slippers in the Sukiennice market! Wawrzek, did you buy your own slippers already? Leave him alone. Get to work, brothers! ...or you won't make it in time for dinner. Was he chasing you again? Tried to strangle you? Leave the boy alone. ...always so sleepy, Wawrzus? If you take so long with every turnip, you'll never finish! ...a feast, my lord? What do you require? Fire-eating, tightrope walking? I'll call my assistant. - Froncek! - Come. You come, too. Who knows what this is about. - Can't Froncek come instead? - No, you're coming. Meister's coming! What? Stanko? - What do you want? - Give me this wood. Take it and go. Wawrzek! What are you doing here at night? I broke the rooster at the tavern. I never lit the light. I woke up with the sun. I always put the tools back. I only took wood I absolutely needed. Are you aware all the decent people are asleep right now? Why aren't you asleep, my Lord? My Saints won't let me sleep. They keep asking me for favours. To dress them nicer. To dignify and add gravity to their postures. And to make them look as if they were alive. And they're so needy, they won't even let me rest at night. If you'd let me, my Lord, I could stay up with you. I'd help you with all my might. You want to carve this much? I want nothing else in the world. Forgive me, my Lord. I didn't have any place to put the animals that I took from my village. The lizard... And the dog... And the cow... But... But I... I want to shape trees into people. So that they're as big as trunks in the forest. And just as beautiful... ...As they are when you carve them, my Lord. You can stay with me for as long as you wish. But you must swear to always do as I tell you. And finish every task I give you. You'll leave your dreams of wooden people behind. But starting tomorrow you'll be studying carefully, and most importantly, learn how to handle a chisel to make it follow your will. How to boil glue to make it stick. How to mix the paint to achieve the colours you desire. And now you'll go to sleep immediately, and I'll never see you at night again. You'll have to paint the rooster. And these animals... These animals of yours... Hide them and guard them with care. The lizard, and the dog. And the cow. It looks so real! Who made this rooster for you? I have no idea. I came out at dawn to clean, I opened the shutters, and there it was! A rooster. - And you don't know who made it? - You didn't order one? And you don't know who hung it up there? Well it couldn't have climbed up there on its own. Someone carved it and hung it up. And a good craftsman, at that. Why do you look so sad? I worry the kids will break the rooster again, I can't stop them. And a rooster like this, no less! There's one, now. Go away! It looks so wonderful up there. Just like the real thing. And look at its tail! You call this "craft"? So sloppy. The other one was better. Stupid kid. - Barely reaches above the table! - Better? Are you blind? Its head is crooked. Sloppy work. What are you saying? That its head is crooked, and so are its legs. He doesn't like it. Wawrzek. Come here. Wandering around for nothing. Bored already? The Meister has a soft spot for him. Did you see? Go to Stanek. How many times a day can you go to see that rooster? - I can't stop myself. - What, are they praising it? Yes, they're saying a good craftsman did it. I swear to God, Stanko. - And you believed them? - Yes. No. Okay, now look. I'm supposed to do this all. There's an empty space here, we have to fill it. Maybe a cottage, like in a village? Stanko. Just like in Poreba. - You'll help me. - Me? I'll be helping? Yes, the Meister said so. We have to hurry up. The King said he wants to see the Altarpiece this autumn. - What's wrong? - Nothing. His Majesty, the King Casimir. It's a great honour, my good Lord, for a simple craftsman such as me. Usually I try not to disturb people at work. But I was overtaken with curiosity, and needed to see the artwork I've heard so much about. They're but parts of the finished piece, Your Highness. The finished Altarpiece will be a triptych. The passing of the Holy Mother in the centre. Above that, Her Assumption. The predella at the base of the Altarpiece I plant to carve into a tree, suggesting Mary's genealogy. The Altarpiece will be topped off with an arch. Just like in Italian meister's works! That is precisely right, Your Highness. They are able to see God not just in the sky. They see Him on Earth. In the nature that surrounds us. And in humans, too. Humans and nature, you say. Meister Kalimach told me a lot about your Altarpiece. It will take a long while to finish, Your Highness. I think two years. This is John the Evangelist. Here is Jacob supporting Mary. On these panels, that will become the foldable parts of the altar, I placed 18 scenes executed in relief. I hope you take notice, Your Highness, not only of God and his Saints, but the plants and flowers of this country, too. And the people, too, carved as they are. The old men with all their flaws. The young, with their beauty and brightness. It's hard work. We might have to wait a long time for this art piece, Meister Veit, if you have more helpers akin to this one. He's still only a child, Your Highness. But his love for the craft is great, and he pursues his goal like a grown man would. And even though his hands struggle to hold the heavy chisel upright, I must admit, Your Highness: they're gifted hands. He carved many of the things you see in this room. A child? Come closer. I hear you're a great craftsman. You deserve a reward. What would you'd like? Tell me. Slippers, Your Highness. Yellow ones. Slippers? Why specifically yellow? It's the prettiest colour! If that's what you want... After we get back to Wawel, make sure that a Page... Give him a ducat from me. I'm extremely grateful. You've managed to add glory to my time of rule with your hard work. If in the future someone recalls Veit Stoss' name, maybe they'll think about King Casimir of the Jagiellonian bloodline, too. Burek, Burek. - Do you recognise me? - Yes. Of course you do, little one. That's good. We can talk. Where are you going? We have time. I'll just lock the door so that we're not disturbed. I did tell you we'd meet again, didn't I? Didn't I? Get down. Get down! Where could he go? I'm sure something bad happened. He probably went to break that ducat he got from the King. He's buying sweets at Sukiennice. But it's night. The stalls are closed. Whatever. I told you! He's back. He's not here. He's not here. - Go look for him. - What for? He'll turn up on his own. Let the dog go. Are you still up there? Fool. I don't need to climb up there to get you. You'll come down. We have time. Sleep well. - Take your lanterns. - Right, right. Lead the way, Burek. - I'll go through here. - Fine. Follow the dog. Good job. But they're not the keys for the door. I wanted to kill you for exposing me back then. But you can come in handy. I've been watching you for a while now. - I think he's in there. - Should we knock? - Come here. - Wawrzek, Wawrzek! I can teach you. Not just in the citizens robes, but in chests - ducats, gold. You can slip in through a whole in a roof. I can't do it. You can be rich! Look. Look. It's all yours for the taking! What did the King give you? A single ducat. The King! I'm the King around here! - Wawrzek, can you open the door? - Wawrzek, Wawrzek! Wawrzek! Stanko, I'm here! He's in there! Wawrzek! Open up! Wawrzek. He's in there! - Stanko, help me! - Silence! He wants to kill me! It's Black Raphael! Stanko, he wants to kill me! Help me, Stanko! Stanko, he's going to kill me! Wawrzek, Wawrzek! Wawrzek, where are you? Come on! Watch out, Kudras! It's Black Raphael! Kudras! Yes, it's me, Black Raphael! - Let me through! - Watch out, he can hurt you, too! Who's next? Just try to come closer! What, are you scared? Better give up now, you're not making it out of here alive! But I'll take some of you with me! You want to catch Black Raphael alive? - Take this! - Get him, now! Get him! - Wawrzek. - Stanko. You're so brave, Wawrzek! We got you! Get him! Tie him up with chains! Tightly! Very tightly, or he'll just break out. Stop struggling! You can't avoid punishment this time! Your time has come. Lead him to the town hall! - Go on. - Go on. Come on. Let's go. Have the herald announce that we have captured Black Raphael! Somebody help me! Kudras, Czeslaw, get over here! Get over here. Who missed this? Do I have to take care of everything?! - What happened? - What's wrong? What's wrong? This! Look! The King is coming with his entire court in an hour. I think I'm going to have to run. What, can't you see? Saint Stanislaus is standing emptyhanded, and his crosier is here! - What are you doing? - Get down, Kudras can climb. - I'm too heavy, it will break! - Get down here! I was trained by tightrope walkers. Don't worry, Meister. He can climb it, he's light. Be careful. Don't look down. Careful, stop staring. Be careful! He's holding on, he won't fall. He did it! Slowly. Be careful. Hold on! What happened? Climb back down, now. Wawrzek. Why aren't you coming down? My slipper... It fell behind the Altarpiece. Climb down. You'll get another one. - He did well. - What a brave kid. - You're a hero, Wawrzus. - Come now. - Don't cry. - Don't cry, you're a journeyman! So big and still crying? Don't cry. I'll buy you two pairs. Even three! Things like that happen sometimes. One moment you think you've finally reached happiness, and then the next something happens and it ruins everything. But that's the wonderful strength, the incredible power of a human being that they rise up and keep walking forward. Only one thing can truly satisfy them: leaving a permanent mark on the world. A deed or a thought. Sir! - Where is that slipper now? - What? What slipper? There was no slipper.
