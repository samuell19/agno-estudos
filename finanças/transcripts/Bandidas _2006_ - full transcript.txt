Please, take notes. There are no wounds to indicate foul play from a weapon. The contents of the safe are intact, ruling out robbery as a motive. We found only the victim's fingerprints, on the doorknob and door frame. Indicating no one entered or left the room. The window is locked from the inside. No one entered that way, ruling out homicide as a cause of death. There's no whisky in the glass or on the deceased's breath. There are no fibers on her shoes, so she never stood on the carpet. There's a scuff on her right shoe tip. There's traces of polish on this upturned bit of carpet. There are traces of flower pollen on the edges of the nostril. I therefore conclude from the evidence gathered... The deceased entered with some flowers. She placed them in a vase by the door. She took the vase and the whisky tumbler, and went across the room. The flowers got too close to her nose, and she sneezed! Her foot slipped forward. Caught her shoe on the carpet. Tripped, hit her head. Died from shock to the brain. It was not foul play that killed this poor woman, but an accident caused by a simple sneeze. And in fact it is not a woman at all. But a man, wearing a horse-haired wig. Bravo! Bravo! Oh, Quentin, I'm so proud! - You know what this means? That we can marry! - Science has a place in police work. I proved it. I convinced all of them. - Now there's only 1 person left to convince. I'm convinced. But you must remember Mr. Jackson, if we don't own the land within 90 days, the railroad will go to other banks to finance their expansion. No worries, Mr. Ashe. In 90 days we'll be laying track right through Mexico City. Go! That's a good one. You do better. How could you sell my farm to the gringos? - Pedro, we have no choice. The American banks control the cash flow, and so, they control us. Don Diego is doing all he can. - I'm sure Don Diego is. But I've worked my whole life to leave something to my poor daughter. All she knows is the farm life. What will become of her? You cheated! I wasn't concentrating. Best of 3. Let me talk to Bernado. - He just follows orders. So we're going to stand by and let them steal our land? Unless some higher authority intercedes... Maria, where are you going? - To the higher authority. Up! Up! Her mother's spitting image, God rest her soul. My condolences, Don Diego. - 20 years she's gone, now. She left you a beautiful daughter. - She's been at school 10 years in Europe. Left a girl, came home a woman. - Indeed. My problem now is convincing her to stay. She's been home for a week and already, she wants to go back. Where's Don Diego? He can't be disturbed. - Neither can I, but I am. He's with an important person. He's always said every client is important. - This is not a client, Maria. This is a man from the Bank of New York. I knew it. Gotta pay the toll. Mi corazon, may I present Mr. Jackson from the Capitol Bank and Trust of New York. How do you do, Mr. Jackson? - Infinitely better in your presence. Gracias. - Afternoon tea. How civilized. Are you surprised that we're civilized? - No. Not at all. I find it charming. - Charming? If you use this word, I presume you've never experienced the pleasure of an afternoon tea. Mr. Jackson's bank will provide us with the capital to continue what we're doing. We were just going over the papers. A big New York bank interested in our small Mexican bank. Why is that Mr. Jackson? If you can't help friends in need, who can you help? In Europe we have another perspective on the American definition of friendship. Forgive my ignorance, Señorita. I'm uninformed on the European perspective. But I'm always willing to learn. I'd be delighted if you'd enlighten me, perhaps over dinner? Perhaps some other time. I have a long ride tomorrow. Checkmate! Hasta mañana, Papa. - Hasta mañana. Goodbye, Mr. Jackson. Men! They only have one thing on their minds! And by the way, that includes you. I see how you look at that little filly of Señor Gomez. A little more. A little more. Stay here! Don't talk to anybody. Excuse me? Excuse me? What was that hmm? Is there a problem? - For me, no. For the horse you poke with metal, every time you want it to do something? For him, I'm sure it's a problem. But he's too polite to say anything. Certainly more polite than you. Thank you for your opinion, misinformed as it is. What are you doing in my house? - So, you're the daughter. Yes, I am. And you are? - Maria Alvarez. Do you work for us? - No, I do not work for you. Why are you here? - I have business with your father. What sort of business? - Private business. Hey! Hey, stop! Maria! Maria! Stop her! I knew it! You helped the Gringos steal our land! You betray your people! - How dare you accuse me! Get her out of here! Have her arrested! - Traitor! Thief! You'll pay for this! I'm sorry. They're stealing our land! Don Diego is a traitor! Don Diego is a traitor! The future. - To the future. Buenos dias amigos. Are you lost? Mister Alvarez, Pedro? You're delinquent on your loan payments. How can I pay when the interest is more than I earn? Says here that if you're in arrears, we have the right to foreclose, and buy this property for 1 peso. Que cabrones. Over my dead body. No problem. There's your receipt, Mister Alvarez, Pedro. Burn it! You should have locked them up, not me. They didn't break into a house. - They're doing worse. You want my advice? Stop trying to change the world. You want my advice, Gustavo? You should start trying to change the world. Eat! The poultice to help your horse's hoof. Thank you. Now who's gonna be outside? Keep an eye on her. What are you doing here? - Read this, old man. What's this? - It's for you. You haven't made your payments so we're foreclosing on this property. I've given you everything you're getting from me. Get out! Papa! Papa! Papa! Maria. Papa! Papa! Somebody please, go get a doctor. What did you do? - I didn't do anything. We were finishing the arrangements... - You killed him. You killed my father! - He's evidently had a heart attack. No! He was health... He was healthy! You did something to him! I know you did! I know this is a terrible shock for you, but you need to try and remain calm. In fact, you need to sit down. Grief is intense, I understand. But if you can, let's review this calmly. Your father's dead. Everything he had, is mine. In your belief that I caused his death, you attacked me. You're trying to kill me. I react in self-defense. Before we can stop this, I shoot you dead. But it doesn't have to end that way. Look at that, darling. It's choosing time. That's it. I guess we've got a deal. If you don't mind, I need to go to my room. I must lie down. This is all too much for me, at once. You understand? Yes, absolutely. I understand. Take all the time you need. Don't worry about a thing. I'll make all the arrangements. Oh, darling? You like your afternoon tea sent up to your room? That would be very nice. Thank you. Hey, get back here! Come back here, you bitch! Come back! I got you now! Hey! God dammit! Padre! - Maria! They shot him. - I know, my child. I know. What do you want from me? I have nothing to give you! Nothing! You should have eaten when you had the chance. Get out of here! Shoo! Hands up! No one... move! What are you doing? - What do you think? I'm taking this bank. - With an unloaded gun? How do you know? - There's no bullets. You're not robbing this bank. Find another one. It's the only bank in town, and it's my father's. Take that off. It doesn't match your shirt. Everyone knows It's you. Who wouldn't recognize that voice? "My father's bank!" It is my father's bank. Now I need to finish my job. Señoritas. - Stealing from the people is hardly a job. Señoritas! I am not stealing. I'm taking it back from the bastards who murdered my father. They killed him? - Señoritas! What? We're going to secure, and then remove all deposits from this bank. Then instill some new confidence in it. I want the stars and stripes flying up there. So it starts looking a little more American, down here. Señor Manager? This establishment is now a subsidiary of the Capitol Bank and Trust of New York. Let's open up a vault. See what kind of cash is on hand, in the liquid assets department. Excuse me, where is the vault? - In Don Diego's office. Well. I guess that would be Señor Jackson's office now, wouldn't it? Ha ha ha! We did it! We did it! We did it! We did it! We did it. - What do you think you did? We'll help lots of people. To help, you'd have to reverse the massive theft of property that's taken place. Listen. How many kilos of rice can we buy with this? We can feed 500 people! Why were you robbing the bank? - Revenge. So you weren't doing it to help the people? - No! What? Stop looking at me that way. My life is not here. What are you doing? - I'm taking the money. I'm going back to Europe. - You're joking? Alright, you can take half. You can even keep the dog as a bonus. If you want to go, go. But the money stays. All of it. No, it doesn't. - Yes. No. it doesn't. We were debating the basic economic theories of wealth distribution. Yes. Yes, we were. - That's good. But before you reach any hasty conclusions, let me show you something. What? Rice and beans are not good enough for you? I can't eat when I see what's been done to the people. At least tonight they can eat. We have to get their land back. We must come up with a plan. Something that would benefit the people, and destroy these murderers. I think we should rob more banks. Yeah. Let's go! - Let's go where? Let's go rob more banks. We can't just go, right now, and rob a bank. Fine. Finish brushing. - That's not it. We're not ready. Yes, we are. We just did it. - We were lucky. We can't rely on luck. We need to think first. We need to consider the implications, the consequences. You're so complicated! - You're so unrealistic! This is a noble cause you seek to undertake, Señoritas. But if you keep fighting like cats and dogs, you won't make it to sunrise. My daughters, you know... When Columbus proposed his journey to discover the New World, everybody said it was unrealistic. But he succeeded. He had the King and Queen of Spain to help him. Who do we have to help us? I think I might know someone who can help you. Can I help you? - We're looking for these two. Why would Señoritas like that be way out here? Found this on a cactus a half mile down the road. You find any more of that, you can make a nice little hankie. Would you get your foot out of my door? - And if I don't? I'll kill you. Now, get your sorry ass off this porch. You too. Fuera! Fuera! Fuera! Come on. Shut up! - Hey, does this belong to you? Thank you. - Excuse me... Where are you going? - Far away. Guys like that come back with reinforcements. You said you would help us. - I just did! The Padre said you'd teach us to rob banks. Where did he get that idea? - You used to do it. You robbed 37 banks and never got caught. 37, huh? Last time I go to confession. Listen, high-minded ideals is one thing, robbing banks is another. And neither of you pass the muster. We're well aware of that. - That's why we came to you, to learn. To learn, you need resources. All you've shown me is a talent for bringing trouble to my door. Buena suerte, ladies! Mr. Buck! You're not going anywhere until you tell us what we need to know. If you pull the trigger the way you're pointing it, it might rain. You ever fired a pistol? I have. - You didn't kill anybody. There's always a first time. - This ain't it. Hey! What are you doing? Come on! Come on! Get up! Goddamn! Come on! Come on! Get up! What did you do to this horse? - They killed my father. And they almost killed mine. You're breaking my heart. Alright, no whining, complaining, or fighting or I'm adios. I never whine. Oh, please! - Oh, please. Well I don't. Don't. - Don't hit... Don't you hit me. - Ladies. Hey! What's it going to be? Deal! Alright, you first. That's pretty good. How many you got left? - I don't know. You need to know. Many a man's died, for want of an extra bullet. She's not good with numbers. - Your turn. I can't do this. When I'm nervous, I hiccup. - Guns make you nervous? What are you going to use to rob banks? - My education. My education! - What's so funny? To rob a bank! To rob a bank! You wish you had one, you ignorant show-off! Fort Granger, Oklahoma. US Cavalry. That's my education. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! No one moves! - Get on the floor! How are they going to get on the floor? I said don't move! Right. So get on the floor and no one moves! Sara, I have to tell you something. - Hold on. This has nothing to do with robbing banks. Robbing banks is easy. Getting away is the hard part. Sara! - How long do we have to do this? As long as it takes. What? - I don't think I can hold any longer. So drop off and swim to the shore. I can't swim! Sara! Sara! Maria! Hold on to the rock! Thank you. For what? - For saving my life. You noticed this time. Good. Sara? - What? I guess... I guess this makes us friends now. I don't know about friends. But partners? Definitely partners. Single file. You got to aim the gun. Aim it. No, higher, higher, higher. Stinky, I'm sorry! Come on, go! Faster, faster! Before you kill your dog, let's try something. Take that. See what you can do with those. I knew she had talent. 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 24... That's the expert? Mr. Cooke. Welcome to Mexico. Clearly, they're amateurs. Robbing a bank in less than a minute with no casualties, is pretty professional. That's odd. These land transfers they left behind. Who sells a farm for 1 peso? The claim is that you're an expert in criminal science, correct? Yes. - Down here I'm the expert in land finance. Why don't we both just focus on our respective areas of expertise? Time's slipping away here. What's the 1st rule of robbing a bank? No one gets killed. - 2nd? Take no more than you can carry in 1 hand. - 3rd? Getting away is the 1st rule. - Perfect. So, are we ready? You only needed to know 1 thing all along. You learned that in the river. Trust your partner with your life. Why did you make us do everything else if we were ready? Well, I kind of liked having you two around. Now go rob you some banks. Everybody, hands up! The room has been left undisturbed since the death? Yes. You've worked here long? - Almost 20 years. Did he take medication for his heart condition? Don Diego was healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life. Thank you. If you'll excuse me. This'll cover the farms north of the river. I was thinking, we already have a lot of money. Maybe we should stop before the regulat... - They took 10 banks. We take 10 banks. Right. We still have 5 to go. 4. - That's what I said. 4. But one of my parishioners told me about a specialist they brought in. A specialist? For us. I'm afraid, yes. A detective from New York. - Let him come. Hola. Are you Padre Pablo? - Yes. May I come in? - No. I thought the house of God was open at all times. It is but God is not at home right now. He's down the road at the orphanage. Where I was just going. I'm Quentin Cooke. I know who you are. Oh, you do? - It's my job to know what concerns my flock. Okay, then maybe you can help me. This girl. Do you think you could tell me... - No. I didn't finish. - You want to know if I've seen her. I'm sure you haven't seen her. Could you tell me if she had any problems with her father. I loved my father. Why does he ask this? She loved her father. Why do you ask such a question? Just the way he died. Anyway... I'm at the hotel in Santa Rita, if you have any information. What did he mean about my father's death? - You heard what I heard. If you want to know any more, you will have to ask him. Come on. Come... We can take him right here. What? - Wonderful. How do we get the information? We ask him. - Our picture's all over the town. So what? We wear bandanas. - I have a better plan. Hello, mister, do you want company? What are you doing? - Saving time. Yes? Hola! Wrong... room! - No. We're compliments of the management. She's new. - I'm sorry, ladies but I have a fiancée. And we have some questions. - Hands up! Down! - Up! Down! - Excuse us for a minute. You've never seen one? - Yes, but in the dark. Up! - My wallet's over there. This is not a robbery. - Oh my God! You're them! Yes, it's us. - You're not getting any answers out of me. I will not dishonor my profession. What are you doing? - We ask the questions. Is this the fiancée? Not bad. What are you doing? - Puts me in the mood. Ready? - Smile! Mamacita! Beautiful! Unless you tell us everything we want, these pictures will appear in every paper from here to New York. With a special set going to your fiancée. You won't have to worry about dishonoring your profession. Because you won't have one. Now, tell me about my father. - I'm not telling you anything. This is a waste of time. - Excuse her, she's a bit impetuous. Mr. Cooke, I'm asking you as a daughter who lost her father. Did you father drink wine? - His passion. It wasn't a heart attack. He was poisoned. How do you know that? - Science. But you have no right to rob American banks. - Mexican banks! They're owned by Capitol Bank of New York, and are protected by American laws. Your country always manages to justify interfering in other people's affairs. You break the law. You're breaking it! - What? By helping them rob our people. Help! Help! Enough with the hat. The hat belongs on this head. And that... That is nothing to be ashamed of. - Who said I was ashamed? Have you been with a man? - Yes. Of course. - You haven't! Yes, I have. - Prove it! Do you want a paper signed by a witness? - No, kiss him. What? - Well... Kiss a man right, he'll never forget you. Do it wrong, he won't remember you. If you've made love, you know this. If you haven't, you don't. That's the proof, kiss him. I have a fianc... ...cée. Kiss a man like that and he'll forget you instantly. Is that what you want? - No. Watch. I don't think that... That's a kiss. - That's a kiss. Now you try it. Come on. Think of the sweetest summer fruit. Open... How was that? - Better. I thought that was pretty good. - Yes, technically. But now... You have to capture the nuance. Sara! - What? It's 10 to 3. Sara! - What? The bank closes at 3. - Damn. Where are you taking me? - You wanted proof. You already took the money! - We're not here for that. Here's your proof. Who sells a farm for 1 peso? Who would sell a farm for 1 peso? - Here. Check the railroad map. Look who's the real criminal. I think there's something you should see. Tell me you have a plan. - No. We have two choices. Run or fight. - Right, die now or die later? Well, do you have a better idea? - I do. Put your guns down or he dies! - Fine by me. I said put them down! Now! He's the boss's son-in-law. Never mind. The expert from New York was kidnapped by the Bandidas. Excuse me, what? - Kidnapped by the Bandidas. How did that happen? He was in the middle of his investigation, when two she-monsters overwhelmed him and took him by force. Oh my god! My poor darling! Don't tell me they killed him? Now, I'm out of time here. And I am completely out of patience. And I would dearly like to see those two little split-legged bitches dead! Follow me! Get in there! We warned you! Damn, get out of here. What is this? It's fingerprint powder. - What's fingerprint? See these swirls on your finger? If you touch something and I put that powder on it, I can see your fingerprint, and I know you were there. How do you know it's mine? - No 2 people have the same print. Have you checked everyone in the world? - No, but it's proven by science. Doesn't sound very scientific to me. What's this? That's a microscope. It helps you see things that you can't normally see. Like a thought? - Yeah. Sort of. I don't see anything. - Think harder. Sara, what's wrong? - What's wrong? Everything. Jackson's brought in reinforcements. Real killers. Every bank is guarded now. They're hunting us. I'm out of ideas. I hate to disappoint these people, but I can't do this. I think you can. - Quentin, look at me. I was raised to be a spoiled lady, not a renegade. 1 minute I think I have all the answers, the next I am crying for a manicure. I am lost out here. Maybe I'm just lost. My mother is gone. My father is gone. I have no place in the world. - Maybe out here is where you belong. Besides, you're not alone. - Right. A gun-happy farm girl, an ugly dog, a wet-behind-the-ears cop and a spoiled brat. What a team! This may seem odd, having dedicated myself to the law, but I think what you are doing here is good. In fact, I think it's damn noble. And I'd like to help. How? They're after 2 women. I guess this is what it feels like, huh? To be married. Yes. May I ask you a favor? - Of course. It's our wedding day. Can we lose the horse? It's a little obvious. Don't disturb him. I need him to concentrate. You know what you have to do? Okay. Here we are. It'll never work. Because she's wearing the wrong shoes. I'd have done it, but I'd rather die than wear that dress. Good day, welcome to our bank! Welcome. Step in, please. Your family jewelry will be quite secure. He takes such good care of me, my Quentin. The slut! She can't even get the kiss right. We've got work to do. She's very excited. The walls are two feet of poured cement, reinforced with iron bars. The safe is bolted into the ground, which is three feet of solid rock. Did you hear that? - What? Sounded like a horse on the roof. I have to ask you a personal question. Do you drink before dinner? - No. I was just wondering. Hearing horses on the roof... Can we see inside the safe? - Only if you're ready to make your deposit. How about for... withdraws? Great! Just great! - I didn't know he was going to faint! These are like megaphones. Quiet! Are you sure you can open it with that? - No, not officially. Hey! Can't you go faster? I'm going as fast as anyone half deaf can go! We got you surrounded! How much longer? I did it! I did it! I did it! Open this damn door! Fire! You've only got one more chance! - I know! They blew the safe. There it is. OK, you got it? Let's go. - Can I ask you something? What? - How was my kiss? Perfect. How the hell... Come on! Anything wrong, Mr. Jackson? - Nothing to be concerned about, Governor. To be honest, Mr. Jackson... My ministers worry about the safety of our state's gold deposit in your bank. They're suggesting we move the gold to a bank not owned by your company. That gold is as safe as if it was deposited in my own pocket. Judging by the success you had stopping these Bandidas, you may want to check your pockets. May I show you something? This is a prototype of a revolutionary new system of security devices. We're installing this in all of our banks. Including the one that holds your gold. You! Step on the floor. Step-o on-o floor-o. Cut it off! That floor is fitted with a system that reacts to the slightest weight change. Before anyone can reach that safe, they'll be dead! Dead. I'm reassured that our gold is in good hands. - Thank you. But I'm concerned about people who deposit money in your bank without the new system. These Bandidas can strike anywhere, anytime. - May I tell you something in confidence? Until those new systems are installed, all the cash will be stored... upstairs. They'll never get anywhere near it. I'm so sorry. Her mother was her life. - I understand. My daughter is the same way. She would just die if the jewelry her mother left her, wasn't in the safest place. That's why I brought her here. - Oh. Sweetheart, you understand me... ...so well. She's very upset. May share a confidence with you? Today we put in the most advanced security system ever. Oh, can we see it? - Sorry, no one can see it. We can't do it. - Yes, we can. The only place not covered by the alarm is 1 inch on the seam. How would you get across? Her education. At least I have one. And what will you use to open the vault? - The key. Nice shot. Thanks. - What's this? Careful! It's dipped in poison made from South American tree bark. The Indians use it to hunt. It puts the animal to sleep. Use this if you have a problem. Okay, go! I got it. - Okay, okay. Go! Come on! - Okay. Calm down. Sorry. Great. When were you last on these? - I was 10. Great. - Don't worry, I can do it. No need to rush. Don't take any chances. Stay calm. Don't be nervous. - You're making me nervous. What's wrong? - I need to be calm. Yes, you're right. Calm down. Okay, I'm calm now. - Me too. How was my kiss? Perfect. - I knew it. Do you really have to sing? - Yes! It puts me in the mood. - Okay. Bravo! Santa Maria! - Oh my... I'm gonna go check the vault. - I'll stick that banjo up your... I'm tired of that banjo. Hey, what's the matter with you? You alright? More fire for the wood. More wood for the fire. Tequila must be pretty good, down here. Sara! Hurry up! - I'm doing my best. Everything calm? - Yeah. What are you doing? - I was taught to finish what I start. If I'm going to rob a bank I'm going to do it properly. You damn idiot, what are you doin' with my gun? Okay, slow, slow, slow. Who are you calling a damn idiot? I ain't no damn idiot! Come on. Come on. Shut up! - Stop. Don't move. Quentin! Hold it. Hold it! Quentin! Sara! Come on, let's go! Go! Go! Go! Party's over! Looks like we're about to start the party. You may want to do some last rights, Padre. You can't even do a simple thing like stare at the street! You were supposed to be looking out! - I was. If you had, we wouldn't be here. - Well, if you weren't so greedy... You are inefficient and unprofessional. I saw those kisses at the bank. That's what brides do. And don't play innocent. You stuck your tongue down his throat. Brides don't smell like horses and kiss like chickens. I was a widow in need of comfort. Well, he said my kiss was perfect. - Well, for your information... I'm sick of both of you fighting over kisses when the future of your country is at stake! What am I doing? You're not serious. You're silly girls playing with thousands of lives. A spoiled brat and a farm hand. Do you think you're changing history? What was I thinking? Throwing away my life and my career! And for what? You know what's sad? No one will care, nothing will have changed because we're dead! Viva! I might not know who I am, but I know who I'm not. I'm not someone who'll let her country down! Viva Mexico! Viva Mexico! Viva la Revolución! Governor, I have good news and bad news. My people were able to save a portion of the money. We even had both Bandidas in custody. The bad news is, your people freed them! I must apologize to you. I didn't expect the situation to become so unstable. Your help has been invaluable. Now I'm hoping you have a solution. Rest assured, the Capitol Bank and Trust of New York has a solution. They're moving the gold reserve to Texas. - What does it mean? It means it's over. He figured it out. Figured what out? - How to beat us. We're beating him! We're strong enough to take the other banks. So, let him have the gold. We'll have all the money! Maria, the money is just paper. It represents the value of the gold. It's the basis of the entire monetary system. Without the gold, the paper has no value. Then we should rob the gold. What's wrong? Shut that and lock it. - Yeah, right away. You know, this might be the last time we get to talk. Don't say that, it's bad luck. I'm a suspicious peasant, remember? No, you're a lot more than that. You always know what you want and you always know what you feel. I admire you. You admire me? How can you admire me? All I know about is horses and chickens. Well, now I also know how to really give a good kiss. You've been a good partner. You've been a good friend. You've taught me a lot about caring about people. And you were... you were a beautiful widow. - Well, black is always a flattering color. I'd like to get something off my chest. This bloody corset. It's been squeezing my gut my whole life. Thank you so much for making the effort. Mr. Governor, it's not an effort, it's an honor. You wanted me here to show our support for your plan. Here I am. Señorita Clarissa, thank you for gracing our journey with your beauty. I wish I could be better company. I'm so nervous about Quentin. Is there any word? - Mr. Jackson? I wouldn't be surprised if your man was by your side real soon. Really? - Really? If you'll excuse us, miss. Gentlemen. Did you hear that? - Every word. It's sad that my nation's wealth must be protected by another country. Sir, you're acting in your people's best interests. Governor, I'd like for you to review our security measures. Of course. Excuse me. - Yes, yes, certainly. Mr. Jackson, was my trip down here really necessary? Mr. Ashe. In order to get that gold released, the governor needed a show of confidence. In order to catch those 2 women, I need that gold on board. - Catch them! What do you mean? The walls have ears in Mexico. So I whispered into them. That gold is my bait. The fish are on board, I guarantee you that. - Good God! Once we get to Texas our law takes effect. They'll be hanged by sundown. Hanging someone without a fair trial is not our law. Oh it will be. As soon as those two pop up. There's no security out here, Mr. Jackson. Oh, but quite to the contrary, Governor. Indeed there is. Security for my old age. Your gold. Or rather should I say, my gold. I'm not following you. - No, sir, you're not. What is that? - What do you think it is? You'll shoot one of us. - Thanks for your confidence. I'm just being realistic. - You realistic? That's a first. You shooting a gun? That's a first. - Could we just stick to robbing the train? If they don't smell like soup in here, my damn nose is broke. Oh my my my, black beans! Bandidas! Bandidas! Where's the governor? - Stretching his legs. How do you mean? He fell off the train. - Daddy? What's going on? - Look, We had 60 days to lock up the railroads. When I saw that because of those bitches we were going to lose that opportunity, I decided, why not take advantage of the situation, if I could? You're stealing the gold? - Yes sir, I am. Stop this train, right now! - No, sir. I won't. I am not a thief. I will have no part of this! I don't believe I offered you a part. - No! No one moves! - Hands up! Daddy! - Don't move! Turn around! You Okay? - Now see here! I said turn around! You! Drop the gun! You're playing a losing hand. I got men all over this goddamn train. Guess again! You won't get away with this. - You're the one who won't! Killing and robbing our people is over! - What does she mean? He murdered my father! - You ain't got no proof. We have fingerprints and litmus paper. - We have a microscope! What are you talking about? - The scientific method! Quentin! Quentin! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? God! Get out of my way! What are you doing? Come on! - He shot you! God dammit! Where are you going? Are you letting him get away? Is he dead? - If he's not he will be. Should we hold him for the law? - He killed your father! I know. I want to kill him. I dream of killing him. But if I do, that makes me no better than him. Maria. I don't think I can kill a man. - Me, neither. But I'm going to anyway. - Just wound him. Will this give me a bad reputation, shooting people? No, it would just add to your legend. I have a legend? - Of course we do. Always count your bullets. Adios, Señoritas! He was enlisted to uncover the real Bandido. - He helped to fix our country. So we honor him for bravery above and beyond the call of duty. And for his service to the people of Mexico. And for helping to bring our people together. - I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you. I too wish to express my appreciation. Now, if you please, get on the train. I... better go. I can't believe you made it all work out. I'm so happy. She's not a very good kisser. Well, she is, but you're much better, much better. I can't believe the way he was kissing her. So insincere. Such a liar! Telling me my kiss was perfect. Then you. I'm sure he's telling her the same thing. What do you think? Sara! - What? Isn't it obvious he doesn't love her? - Is that why you woke me up? I was having such a nice sleep. - At least you can sleep. I could sleep before I met you. Now, I can't stop thinking. You should be grateful that now your brain is thinking. Please be quiet so I can enjoy the sunset. - You've never seen a sunset before? This sunset reminds me of a particularly beautiful one I saw in Cadiz. Where's that? - Cadiz? In Europe. Can I ask you one more thing? - One more. How are the banks in Europe? Bigger.
