(metal clangs) - Stop! - Come on. I don't wanna hurt you. I don't wanna cut your throat. Got it? (metal clangs) (dramatic music) (footsteps echo) (dramatic music) - Drop it. Get the fuck out of here or I'll blow your nose off. (gun fires) (upbeat music) Do you have a job? - For one thing, I'm not a waitress in a blonde wig. - What do you do? - I take pictures of interesting things and people. - Oh, an artist. I see you sitting here every day all day long. I just wonder. What's your name? - Clarence. - I'm Trinh. So tell me, do you have a girlfriend? - Do you? - I asked you first. Okay, boys, what will it be? (trumpet music) - Ow. (trumpet music) (upbeat music) (phone rings) - Hi, Mr. Johnson. Oh, I'm sorry. No, I can do it. Actually, could I call you back? You could just call me back. Yeah, it's extension three one four five, uh huh. No, I have somebody here, yeah. Okay, okay, thanks. How are you today? - Fine and you? - Good. - Oh. Right, sorry. - Thanks. - I was wondering, were you planning? (phone rings) - Grace speaking, may I help you? Oh, yes, Mr. Johnson, it's only been like three seconds. I don't, yes, I can... Uh huh, okay, yeah I can look it up right now. What's the number? Okay, two. (phone rings) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - But you can't remember where you were? - I lost my wallet, my pager, and my cellular phone, and I can't remember a thing. - Was that the only blackout you had this week? - I imagine so. I sometimes can't remember what I do in the afternoons anymore. Everyday just seems like any other day. - Katherine, this is just a suggestion, but I am thinking about putting you under hypnosis. You think you'll feel comfortable with that? (toilet flushes) (upbeat music) (phone rings) - Hello? No, not yet. (piano music) Oh, I just started cooking. No, it's all right. Bye. (phone beeps) (piano music) - Take off your shoes. Going for the George Clooney look, huh? - Yeah, pretty hip, huh? - Move these boxes for me. I haven't had time to unpack. - Yeah, sure. - Matt should be back any second now. Hey, be careful with that box. - So how old is this one? - What's it to you? - What are we having? - Chicken stir fry. - You know how to make it? - Yes. - Are you sure you wanna move in with him? You've only known him for a month or so, right? Have you told Mom and Dad? - Look, would you just stop with this big brother bullshit? I am an adult now. - Look, I'm just... - Hey. You must be Phil. Oh, excuse me. - Yeah. - How's my little gal? - Hon, can you set the table? - Sure. - Thank you. (dramatic music) - How's the (speaking foreign language)? - Is that what you call 'em? - In Taiwanese, yes. - Oh. - Honey, the garbage disposal's down again. - Okay, I'll take care of it later. - Okay. So, how's work? - Same old stuff. - Are you seeing anybody? - Been kind of busy lately. - I think you'd better start dating soon. Mom and Dad are beginning to worrying about their only son. Hon, do you know anyone you could set him up with? - Sure. I know a few available women. I don't know, what's your type, Phil? - Don't have any guidelines. - Cindy. I'll give my friend Cindy a call. Yeah, I can see you two together. - Naomi tells me that you're an author. What kind of stuff do you write about? - I just finished my latest book. It deals with lycanthropy. Werewolfism. - Oh. I love horror novels. - I write nonfiction. - So have you seen real werewolves? - Well, I did write a book about them, didn't I? - No, I didn't mean that. - Look, lycanthropy might not be well accepted in this society but it's been around before Siddhartha could walk. - Honey, I forgot to get the salad. Why are you busting his balls? - What are you talking about? It was a legitimate question. - Be nice. - I am. - Phil, look, I'm really sorry I snapped at your earlier. - Don't worry about it. - I'm just conditioned to be a little defensive. - You forgot to get the dressing. See what you started. - Phil, I really am sorry. - Don't worry about it. - You know what, Phil offered to do your taxes this year. - Thank you. - Sure. - Hi. - Go back to sleep. - How was dinner with the client? - Same old shit. - Dr. Salarius said he might put me under hypnosis. - You know, Katherine, I think you're fine. - Jim, are you seeing someone? - What did you say? - Is there another woman? - Why did you say that? - Just wonder. - You're being paranoid, darling. - Do you love me? - Of course I love you. (moaning) - No, please. Jim. Jim stop. - What is wrong with you? - Why are you yelling at me? - Let's just go to sleep. (dramatic music) What's wrong, Katherine? - I don't know. (groaning) (radio host speaking indistinctly) (dogs howling) - Karate chop, him. Larry, how do you feel about movement implementing? Hit the legs and fight like a samurai. (can clatters) (upbeat music) - This is not a library, you know. - So tell me, why do you wear sunglasses all the time? - I was born with them. - I suppose you were born with your blonde wig, too? - You're a smart boy. She's my girlfriend, isn't she cute? - Yes. She's very cute. - I just didn't want you to get the wrong idea. I like women. - Very interesting. - I'll catch you later. (customers chatting) - So? - So what? - What about that guy? - What about that guy? I was just giving some more coffee. - You two look good together. - I'm a lesbian, May. - Oh sure. - He came home late that night and I asked him if he was having an affair with another woman. He said no, and then he tried to have sex with me but I didn't want to, and he just kept doing it. - So you told him you were not in the mood, but he kept coercing you to have sex with him. - I told him to shop. - Did he stop? - Not until I pushed him off. Then he yelled at me, and I felt really bad. - Did you feel violated? - I felt guilty. He's my husband, and I feel I've somewhat failed him. - What do you mean by you failed him? - I couldn't give him enough sex. - But it was your choice. You didn't want to have sex with him, did you? - I wasn't in the mood. (phone rings) (keyboard clicks) - Hey, guy, how's it going? - Mr. Lee. - I'm just walking around, scouting out potential players for the company football game. You'll be there, won't you? - Yeah. - You know I'd rather take a brother when I can. Buddy, you know, we have strict guidelines about you know... - Oh, yeah. (razor buzzes) (dramatic music) - May I join you? - Sure. - My name's Grace. - Hi, I'm Phil. - You're the paycheck guy, right? - Yeah. - Oh, that must be fun. Seeing such joy when you disperse them. - That's pretty much the only plus. - Well, at least there's sunshine for you every two weeks. It's better than angry people yelling at you all day. - Were you planning on going to the company picnic? - No way, I try to stay as far away when I'm not working. Why, are you going? - Yeah. - Got suckered in, huh? - Yeah. (laughing) - Well, I've been meaning to talk to you for the longest time, you know, but something always gets in the way. Are you busy next Sunday? - Well, um... - Oh, you're going to the company picnic, right, right. What about next Sunday? - Sure. - Yeah? Would you like to go for an early dinner? - Okay. - Great and afterwards we can go with some of my friends for bible study. - So you're telling me that you're not interested in men? - Not in the same way you would be. - Well, if you don't want him... - He's all yours. - Who are you writing to? - My girlfriend. She left her wallet at my place last week when she came to visit. - She lives far away? - Yes, in New York. - I know a girl who lives here. Her boyfriend lives in Hong Kong. - I guess I should feel lucky. I will see you next week. - Bye, bye. - Well, I told you about how I lost my wallet and everything last week, well someone mailed it back to me, but without my driver's license, and I also got a note from this person. - Your picture is so beautiful, I thought I'd keep your driver's license. - I think the same person has been using my cellular phone, too. - Well, did you talk to the police about this? - No. - Did you tell Jim? - No. - May I keep this note? - Sure. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - And how old is he? (knocks) I'll be off in a minute. Where did you first notice what might be termed an episode? - Can I use the bathroom? - Let's say when you first noticed behavior that might, exactly. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - Shit. Look, I'm sorry. It looked really interesting and... - Tracy. She thought it was all a part of puberty. She can rule a mile at three minutes flat. - She'd make millions pitching sneakers. - And she makes a living being a stunts person. Nobody can understand why she never gets hurt. Oh, excuse me. - Sure. (birds chirping) Hey. - Hi. - Listen, I was wondering. - Come here. - What, what? Ow. - Where is the mole? - Matt, come here, look at this? I pulled this off his neck. - What the? - So what brings you anyway. - I was wondering if you guys would happen to have a bible lying around anywhere. Are you Christian? - No, I just travel a lot. Here you go. - Oh, thanks. - Hon, I forgot to get the radish. - I'll get it later, hon. - No, I think you should go now. - I'll be back. - Do you always send him off every time you wanna talk to me? - It works, doesn't it? Since when did you become a Bible thumper? - A friend recommended it. - This friend wouldn't happen to be female, would she? - Give it a rest. - Going to church is not a way to get laid. - Someone is waiting for you. - Did he order? - I don't dare to compete with you. - What do you wanna eat? - Club sandwich. - And coffee. - Yes, please. Hey. I have something to show you. That's my boyfriend, Kent. He lives in Taipei. - He's a cutie. Is he going to come back? - I don't know. We've been writing each other for a year now. - Let me put your order in the kitchen. I'll be back. - Did I order that? - No, it's on me. Can I ask you a favor? - Sure, if I can help. - I get off work around four. Can you meet me outside? - Okay. (upbeat music) Hi. - Hi. - So, what do you want me to do? - I just want a few pictures of me so I can send my girlfriend. - Okay. Do you wanna do it here? - Sure, why not? Let's take one right at the entrance. Hey, hey, hold my purse. (camera shutter clicks) (trumpet music) (knocks) (trumpet music) - Yeah, could you keep the racket down please? - Oh, my son's trying... - Yeah, no, if that's what you call it, it's a little bit too loud right now. - Wait, he's practicing. He has a lesson tomorrow. - I don't care about the lesson tomorrow. - He's working on something course. - No, just cut it out right now, okay? - He'll stop in a couple of minutes. - No, I don't mean a couple of minutes. - You are a very rude man. - Look, listen... - Okay, that's enough. - What kind of a neighbor are you? - All right, good bye. - No. - Right, bye. - Fuck you. Fuck you. All right, knock your ass, fuck you. (men grunting) (upbeat music) - All right, man, way to go. - Good job, Phil. - Thanks. - Let's go. - Six, eight, 11, 32, 21, hut, hut, hike. (men grunting) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Katherine? - Yes? - Are you all right? - Oh, I'm fine. Do you want some more coffee? - No, what are you reading? - Nothing, really, just some junk mail. I'm going to get some more coffee. Are you sure you don't want any? - No, thanks, sweetheart. (upbeat music) - Those are really bad for you. Didn't you hear what I said? Those are very bad for you. - So is pissing me off. Now scram, shit. - You shouldn't cuss, it's a sin. - So is eating little boys, but I could always go to confession. - I'm telling my sister on you. - I'm gonna eat her, too. Does he belong to you? - Let's go, Timmy. - Sally, he said he's gonna eat me. (customers speaking indistinctly) - Well, it looks like all your tests came out normally. Cough for me. (coughs) - I have a question. - Yeah? - My hair seems to be growing pretty fast lately. - Oh, it's nothing that a shave and a haircut can't cure, breathe. - Yeah, but I have to shave practically every hour. - Well, your testosterone level's a bit high. - What does that mean? - Besides, the hair growth have you felt any different? - What do you mean? - Mood swings, tension? - Some, I guess. - Well, there was this researcher who was studying birds on a deserted island, and he was there for a year, and during that year, he noticed that he had no contact with any other human beings, and he particularly missed the company of women. As the date of his return home approached, he noticed that his hair growth had also increased substantially. Phil, maybe you oughta think about releasing all that tension. (upbeat music) - I'm not going crazy, am I? - Did you expect this person would be a woman? - Yes, because I never felt threatened by her letters. She also left me a few messages on the answering machine. - In normal circumstances, I would consider this harassment. - What should I do? Call the police and put her in jail? - Perhaps a restraining order might help. I can't exactly advise you on what you should do, but in normal circumstances, I would call the police. - She knows where I live, but she's keeping her distance. She could have come to my place and slit my throat. She's probably just lonely. - Are you lonely? - Yes, in a sense. - Are you attracted to women? - Given the right person, maybe. - Are you attracted to this woman? - She intrigues me. In the messages, she said she was just calling to say hi and to check up on me. - Seems like she's become obsessive with you. - I actually don't mind her calling, and I know she's been using my cellular to call me. - Have you told Jim about her at all? - Of course not. - Do you plan on telling Jim about it? - No. Do you mind keeping them in my file? I don't feel like leaving them at home. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (customers chattering) (dramatic music) (knocks) - Excuse me, could you roll down your window? - You have any spare change? Get the fuck out of the car, bitch. (dramatic music) Thanks, bitch. (engine revs) (dramatic music) - Thanks. - Did you break up? - How'd you know? - You have that look. I'd go out with you if I were a guy. - Should I be flattered? - So what happened? - He left a half hour long message on my answering machine from Taipei. - That's it? - It's not like I didn't know things weren't gonna work out. But before he left the message, there was always something to think about, something to hope for. Now I can't bear thinking about him. It's just too painful. - What are you doing tonight? Let's go see a movie. (dramatic music) (phone rings) (siren blares) (upbeat music) (tires squeal) - Oh, shit. - Come on, motherfucker, let's go. (engine revs) (dramatic music) - Do you remember the boy that played Webster on TV? You know, the little African American boy? I was watching TV the other day, and I swear, he looks exactly the same, and he must be like 30 years old now. Isn't that kind of sad? I think he has that disease. Do you know what I'm talking about? (dramatic music) - I am the Lord and there is no other. Besides me, there is no God. I will guard you though you have not known me. Isaiah 45:5. And in chapter 44, verse six, the Lord says, "I am the first and I am the last, "and there is no God besides me." That's what I tell my parents when they ask why I'm always at church. They don't understand, they don't accept it, and the saddest thing is, we will not be able to spend an eternity together. That's why we shouldn't just preach the stuff at people, we need to live our lives according to what we believe. I bring up my parents, our parents, because our parents are the ones that know us the best. They're the ones that will recognize when there's a change in our lives. A change because of the Lord. (insects chirping) - Katherine? (insects chirping) Katherine? (dramatic music) - Hi. - Hi. - Am I late? - No, you're just on time. - Something wrong? - You're gonna take those off in the theater, right? - No. (machine beeps) Hi, Katherine, it's me again. I'm calling because I'm thinking about you. I still carry your photo with me and I look at how beautiful you are when I'm alone at work. I hope we'll meet soon. (speaking indistinctly) And peaches, big peaches. And the fruit cocktail. (laughing) Yeah. - So how can see wearing sunglasses at night? - Why are you so fascinated with my sunglasses? I told you I was born with them. - Right, right. - So you have friends here? - Not really. After he left, I was pretty much alone. We lived together and went to school together, so. - Where are your parents? - In Singapore. I came here for high school, and then I went to college to study photography. After I graduated, I just stayed. But I don't have a green card yet. - Why do you wanna stay here all alone? - I don't know. I guess, I just got used to living here after all these years. Anyway, what about your parents? - They died when I was very young. I don't even remember what they look like. My girlfriend's the only person I have. - Do you miss her? - Yeah. But I know she cares about me a lot. - But is knowing enough to keep you alive? - Most of the time. (dramatic music) - You live here? - Yeah. - How long have you stayed here? - I don't know. (laughing) Have a seat. - Okay. (dramatic music) I don't know what it is. Even though I haven't known you for very long, I feel very comfortable with you. - Sometimes it's not a matter of how well you know someone, it's just a gut feeling. That feeling can last you a lifetime. - Some people live longer, some people live shorter. - That's precisely the point. - Thanks for inviting me over. - Thanks for trusting me. (birds chirping) - Trinh? Trinh? (keyboard clicking) (phone rings) - Phil. What's wrong? We were all concerned about you after you left the meeting last night. - I have more important things to do, okay? - Well, when are you coming back? We could have lunch together in a couple hours. - I'm not. - Phil, what are you trying to avoid? - Would you leave me alone? - I'm just concerned about you. - Look, go find yourself some other little soul to save. (footsteps echo) (birds chirping) Hey, brother. - What can I do for you? - When's the next picnic? - What? - Can't wait to stick that football up your ass. - Excuse me? Katherine? Where the hell were you? (dramatic music) What's going on, Katherine? - These two men carjacked me. - Katherine. - I blacked out. I don't know what happened next, Jim. I can't remember. - You don't remember anything about the last 20 hours? Nothing at all? - No. - How can you not remember? - Why, do you think I'm lying to you, Jim? I can't help it. I don't even know what's going on inside me. - All this weird shit never happened before you started seeing that nut doctor. - You don't understand. - In fact, I understand it better than you do, Katherine. He's fucking with you. Fucking with your mind. - You have no idea what's going on. - So tell me what goes on in his office? - You're crazy. - No, you're crazy, Katherine. You're the one who's out of your mind. - Yes, I'm crazy. You married a crazy woman. - I love you. You know I love you. - Jim. I don't know what we should do. - Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. - Everything's not going to be fine, Jim. (footsteps echo) (upbeat music) (dancers chatting) (upbeat music) - So where's your little brother? Hey, two beers. - It's gonna take more than a couple of beers, honey. - Do you look like that naturally, or do you have to go to school? - Hi, what's your name? - Sammi. - Sammi, that's a nice time. I like the name Sammi. Is it short for Samuel or is it? - Sammi. - So this is where you hang out at? (upbeat music) - What did you tell him? (upbeat music) (laughing) (upbeat music) (rummaging) - Hey. - You got a lot of meat stocked up in here. - I don't know, I've been craving it lately. - Care for a late night snack? - But it's raw. - But I love sushi. And baby, I like it raw. Sammi. Oh, fuck me. Sammi, you here? Sammi? Oh man. - Yes. - Good morning, ma'am. I'm Detective Wade. - And I'm Detective Mike. We'd just like to ask you a few questions, ma'am. - Okay. - A few routine question. Yesterday, did you notice a 25 year old Caucasian woman? - Blonde haired woman? - Blonde hair, wearing a tan dress. - Wearing a tan dress. - What happened? - Ma'am, we're not permitting that information at this time? - Has there been another murder here? - Ma'am, we cannot disclose that information... - If there has been, you've got to tell me, sir. - Everything's under control. - I, look, I... - Ma'am. - I am a single mother with a son... - Ma'am, did you see this woman last night? - And you have to tell me, I will tell you that, you tell me what happened? - We need your help, ma'am would you help us here? - Please. - All right, thank you for your time, ma'am. - We'll keep you posted if there's any further information. - Goodbye, ma'am. It's almost time for lunch. Wanna go to over the deli, get a nice fat pastrami sandwich. - I don't know if I can go there. (knocks) - Oh yeah, I'm not eating meat at the moment. - I'm not eating meat. - Oh, this? (knocks) Hey, you got that thing. (dramatic music) (dog barks) - Are you comfortable? Close your eyes. And just relax. I'm gonna count from one to 10, and you're gonna start going back in time, okay? One, two, three. How old are you, Katherine? - Almost six. - Where are you? - I'm in the dark, I'm on a boat. I feel nauseous. - Are you alone or are you with someone? - I'm crouching in the corner with my brother. There are cockroaches. I'm very hungry. I'm starving. Three men are coming towards us out of the dark. - What do they look like? - One of them has a lot of pimples on the face, the other one has a scar across his cheek. I grab my brother's arm. He pushes my hand off and stands up against the three men. They start pushing him. One of them grabs the jade pendant on my brother's thraot. My brother pulls out a knife and stabs one of them in the throat. The other one pulls out a gun. (gun fires) You fucker, you motherfucking rapist. I'll rip your balls off. My parents gave us some jewelry and money, and put us on a boat from Saigon to Bangkok. My brother died on the boat. They shot him and took everything. I remember everything now. Jim, it's me. I'm calling to tell you that I'll be taking a short trip alone. Please don't worry. I'll talk to you in a few days. Okay, bye. (customers chatting) Excuse me, is there someone named Trinh who works here? - Who? - Trinh? - Oh, she's sick today. - She's sick today? - Who are you looking for? - Trinh, she has blonde hair. - She's sick today, she's not here today. - Is there anyway I can... - Are you Katherine? - Yes. - I'm Trinh's friend. - Have I met you before? - No, but come sit with me. - Can I get you anything? - The same, please. - Thank you. - What is that? - Don't worry, it's good. So you just came in from New York? - New York, no, but how do you know who I am? - Red bean delight. - May, we're trying to have a private conversation. - Oh, private conversation, I see. - Trinh told me to give this to you yesterday. She's waiting for you at home. (knocks) (siren blares) - Hello? (dramatic music) (bird calls) - Who's there? Phil, God, are you all right? Been waiting here long? - I've got a couple of questions. - Sure, come on in, we'll have a cup of coffee. - No, I don't have time. - Come on. - No, God. Sorry. - Hey, Phil, wait a minute. Jesus Christ, when's the last time you slept? - How do most people get rid of the curse? - What people, what do you mean? - Those people in your research. - Why all the sudden are you interested in my research? - Fuck, it's a simple question. - People with lycanthropy usually don't wanna give up the power, it's a privilege to be chosen. - What kind of bullshit is that? - Phil, these people have powers way beyond our comprehension. - And I suppose that they can do whatever they want, because they can. - Well, they don't go around trying to create havoc if that's what you're getting at. They can handle it. - Bullshit. Don't tell me all werewolves are boy scouts. - Contrary to popular belief, the only time a werewolf kills, which is rare, is when there's an element of danger that threatens its own existence. It's a survival of the fittest instinct. But we all have that. - How do they cope with the uncontrollable rage? - Like the rest of us, they just do. - It's not like that. You can't just turn it on and off. - Unless you know when it's gonna be on. The REM cycle is the only time when one loses conscious control, they just do what has to be done to contain it during that time period. Phil, you're not a werewolf. - Did I say I was? - Hey, Naomi's gonna be back any minute. I'm sure she'll want to see you. - Don't tell her about this, okay? (machine beeps) - Jim, it's me. I'm calling to tell you that I'll be taking a short trip alone. Please don't worry. I'll talk to you in a few days. Okay, bye. (machine beeps) - Hi. Nice look. Got a girlfriend, I see. - Matt's been talking to you? - Well, I think I have to know if my brother comes to my apartment fucked up out of his mind. - Everything's fine. - Look, Phil, first Bibles, now werewolves? - Just leave. - Just because you have a little facial hair does not mean you are a werewolf. - What do you want from me, huh? Matt's not enough for you? You gotta go find other people's lives to take over? - Sorry. Come on. It's my job being the youngest of the family. Do you want something to eat? - I haven't slept in days, okay? - Tell you what, I'll cook. - No. - I'll cook. I think you need more fiber. Grab a basket. - Ooh, smell this shit. - Empty the drawer, put the money on the counter. You two, put your money on the counter. Hurry up. - Come on, man, you don't wanna do this. - Put it on the counter, back off man. - Just relax. - Put the money on the counter. Back off, put your money on the counter. - Have you ever done this before? - Put the money on the counter. - Relax. - Back off. - Phil, what are you doing? - You wanna shoot me? - Back off. - You wanna shoot me? - I'll shoot you. - You wanna shoot me, you don't wanna shoot me. - Hurry up. - Shoot me, come on, shoot me. That's what you want, huh? Come on, big guy, here you go, here you go. (grunts) How's that feel, huh? Come on. (grunting) - Stop it, stop it, stop it. Let's go, let's go. Hey, you can't talk about what just happened? - Please go home. - Why can't you just talk to me? - You won't understand. - Phil, you are not some superhero. He's good, I've been going to him for years. Remember when I was really bossy? - I don't need a shrink. - Just give him a try. - I'm fine, I can handle this. - Then it wouldn't hurt to go. Look, I called and he can squeeze you in early tomorrow morning. Call you in the morning? (suspenseful music) - Sammi. I can't tell you how glad I am to see you. - Hi, baby. - No. - I like it raw. - No, no, no. (glass shatters) (engine hums) (dramatic music) (door creaks) (dramatic music) - Can I help you with something? (engine revs) (knocks) - Hello? Doc, you there? Doc, oh. (dramatic music) Come on. (water rushing) (dramatic music) (crying) (door creaks) - Thanks, Charles. So what do you think about next week? I thought we could get everything together? - Grace? - Who is it? - It's me Grace. Don't you remember me? - Phil? - I need your help, Grace. Grace, Grace, listen to me, please. I want salvation, I need your help. - Just don't touch me. Just don't. - I killed two innocent people. I don't know. I don't remember doing it and next, it's all messed up. I didn't mean to do it, I swear, and then, I don't even know who the shrink was. - What do you want me to do for you, Phil? - Grace, I need your help to get rid of this thing. - Just stay away from me. Phil, stay away, back. (dramatic music) - Grace, please take care of yourself tonight. (door creaks) (chains rattle) - Trinh, I haven't seen you for a few days. Are you feeling better? - Better than ever. - Your boyfriend is waiting for you outside. - I'm a lesbian, May. (laughing) (upbeat music) - You look happy. - Yes, yes. - So how's Katherine? - She's still sleeping. - I envy you, Trinh. - So what have you been doing for the past few days? - I met someone at a club a few nights ago. - Well, what's he like? - He's Japanese. He was visiting from London. He bought me a drink. Invited me to his room. Next thing I knew, we woke up in each other's arms. - And? - And nothing. - What do you mean nothing? - He had to catch a flight back to London that afternoon. - And you're mourning him now. - No. I feel content, satisfied. I'm learning to take things day by day, not worry about the future too much. We had very good sex, and it'd been a while since I'd had sex. - I'll be right back. (customers chatting) (upbeat music) I'll be right back. (customers chatting) (upbeat music) Do you need more time? - Oh no, I'm good. I'll have a cup of coffee first. (customers chatting) (upbeat music) I have to look at this. (customers chatting) (upbeat music) - You ready? - I wanna talk to the other waitress. - Why, I can take your order too. - I need to talk to her. (upbeat music) - Can I take your order, sir? - I'll have the club sandwich. - Excuse me? - I need to talk to you. - I think you're mistaken. - Hey, this is you, isn't it? - I didn't send them to you, did I? - No, you sent them to my wife. - What's the problem? - Personal business. - What's going on? - I just wanna talk to her. Can I talk to her alone please? - Why don't you leave her alone? (laughing) - What's that? - Sit your ass down, bitch. Go mind your own business. You have a restaurant to run. I just wanna talk to her. - You're talking to me, Mr. - Mr. Lee, where's my wife? - Who's your wife? - I'll pull this trigger, don't fuck with me, bitch. Where's my wife? - Doesn't she tell you where she goes? - I don't wanna play games. Just tell me where she is. I need to talk to her. - Maybe she'll come back to you, maybe she won't. It's her decision, not mine. - You slept with her, didn't you? - Maybe. - Did you or did you not? - Yes, we did, and you'll never know what it's like. - How many times? - As many as you can imagine. - What does that mean? - Whatever you want it to mean. - Who are you? Take off your sunglasses. - Put down your gun. - I said take off your sunglasses. - Only if you stop pointing that thing in my face. (upbeat music) - Oh, shit, oh, fuck. (upbeat music) Goddammit. (upbeat music) Shit. (upbeat music) Where's that bitch? Where is that bitch? (upbeat music) (dramatic music) - Come on, asshole, fight me like a man. Bet I'll whip your ass. - Yeah? - What are you afraid of? - I'll rip your cunt off, bitch. - Not before I rip your balls off, first. - Yeah, you wanna fight like a man, huh? You dyke. - Come on, sissy, drop your gun. - All right, we'll do it together. (screaming) (punches) (dramatic music) (water running) What am I going to do next? You tell me, Katherine. I don't know. I don't know what I should do. Tell me what I should do. Do what you have to do. Trinh, who am I? You're Katherine. Who's Katherine? Whoever you want her to be. Trinh. Don't go. (dramatic music) Hi Jim, it's Katherine. I'm calling to tell you that I want a divorce. I'll be taking a trip alone for some time, so don't worry. Take care of yourself and we'll talk soon. Bye. (laughing) - Oh fuck. Fuck no. (grunting) - Where are you going? - Anywhere. - That's the same place I'm going. I'm Katherine. - Phil. - Trinh? Trinh? (dramatic music)
