Felipe... We're leaving! Hurry, we don't have all day. You're not thinking of getting in with those feet. C'mon, go home and pick up your things, I said we're leaving. I'm coming, I'm coming... Let's go, Felipe. Hurry up! - The keys! - They're upstairs. C'mon, hurry up! I wish I could see his face. I taught him a lesson. Won't he be surprised! What, you have nothing to say? Not even about the furniture? Well, I'll tell you. That guy wasn't returning the rent deposit, so his furniture... Learn Felipe, my son. Never let anybody get the better of you. Never. BACKROADS What, interested in where we're going? Where? You'll see the new flat. Bigger than the last. A new complex. What's this one called? Sunbeach, Seaview... Sun & Sea. The Sun & Sea complex. Name's unimportant. We're not gonna spend all our lives this way. The flat's fine. In fact, it's great! In a few months, soon as I... In a few months, we'll move to a big city. Enough deserted complexes! I do it for you, Felipe. Think this bothers me? On the contrary, I like this life. Empty beach, just for us. No annoying neighbors... When I talk about the big city, it's for you, your age. You should go to a good school with good teachers. That's enough, Felipe. At least, we got rid of Estrella. Your worst girlfriend. Always calling me "big man". Hello, Antonio... Hello, Estrella... Aren't you going to say anything? Felipe, come and say hello properly... Well, well, well, Felipe, what a big man you are, eh? Come, let's see that flat. What do you think? Like it? Good, real good. Let's see. Good walls, yes sir. They remind me of home. Estrella, remember that I grew up in a 3-storey house? Yeah, 3 floors, with a wine cellar. Your family was rich. You've told me countless times, Antonio. You haven't seen the best part yet. What do you think? - My God... - Antonio! Estrella! Oh, Estrella... Oh, Lozano... Good morning, Felipe. Here's your breakfast. - Do I look OK? - You look very handsome, really. You aren't the first to say so. Why do you have to put on those tatoos? You look like a legionnaire. They're called stick-ons. Hurry, you'll be late the first day. I'll be ready in a moment. Felipe, son... you're leaving the merengue. Everybody, line up! What does your Dad do? Scientist. He's a scientist. No talking on line! Is your Mom a scientist too? Mara√±on! I'm talking to you! What do you want? What? Gonna act stupid or what? Suck my cock or I'll belt you one. You deaf? Suck my cock or I'll belt you! Call Brother Ramon. Brother Ramon! Brother! Last Friday, February 4th, Patricia Hearst was kidnapped. Daughter of magnate, Randolph Hearst, she is considered one of the premier heiresses in America. Hearing the news, her boyfriend... Happy? You've staged your annual act again? Tell me, why do you have to do these things? Say something, where did you learn that filth? Hey, Antonio, it's not so bad. Yeah, but every year it's the same thing, in every school. Felipe, hon... taste this rich yogurt, it's just the way you like it. If you told me I was to blame for this vocabulary, but I'm a decent man and I want my son to be the same... and look at him... Estrella, they have liqueur. Felipe, try the yogurt. The sweets, I told you. Try the yogurt, son. Don't call me son. I'd never have a Mom like you. What am I gonna do with him? - Put in five hundred. - Yes, sir. That road I passed with Mom. Sure, I'm certain. She was carrying you. We went to the beach for the weekend. Five hundred, sir. Let me try. Fucking kids. Another? Shouldn't you all be in school? Hey, do you jerk off? I do it three times a day. One when I wake up, one before lunch and another at night. Shut up! Know what I do? I jerk off in my sock. Feels better. Ever try it with a fly? You take the fly, rip off its wings and place it on your cock. Or better, try the bath tub, but leave your cock outside the water like a periscope, right? Why are you such a pig? Didn't I tell you to shut up? - Shut up! - Alright, OK, shit! Let me go. I swear I'll shut up. What? What do you mean no? No, Estrella, I beg you. Please don't tickle me. Don't tickle me, no, no... Felipe, you're just the person I want to talk to. You could lend a hand. What are you saying? Estrella is the star, Estrella Pinseque. Read the poster. Let's see, when did you ever see a star putting up her own posters? Felipe! He was all ready to come to the concert, Antonio. Forget it. It's his loss. Right, his loss. Watch the images carefully. We repeat, these shots were taken by bank security cameras. We can clearly see Patricia Hearst taking active part in the bank holdup. Where were you? Because of you we were almost late. We might have been better off. To bed. Haven't you seen the time? Good night. Estrella, why are you so upset? This is your first recital. Wait till the next one. More people will have heard about you and will go. And you heard Don Nicolas? He liked it. Liked it a lot. Told me he'd pick up all the expenses again. Where's all the money I gave you? What do you want? The newspaper. For the puzzles. You said it was an investment. An investment, my eye! It was a con! The cost of the classes is nothing compared to what I gave you. Who do you think convinced Don Nicolas? What have you done, Antonio? Nothing, that's what. I did the promotion. Sure, and nobody came. Hey, Estrella, you're a bit nervous lately. Shut up! I only get nervous when I listen to you. I'm coming! Estrella... Don't insist, hon. It's useless. Just think it over again. That's it. I've thought it over. My answer's the same. Antonio, we can't continue. Bye, Antonio. Take care of Felipe. Estrella... Things weren't working out. So I asked her to leave. At least, for awhile. Hope I'm not wrong. She could've been a good mom, Felipe. I know you were fond of her. I'm sorry. Face it like a man. The world doesn't end here. See those factories? That's wealth. That field? Wealth. The world is wealth, Felipe. How can there be poor people with so much wealth? I don't know. You can't know, it's absurd. Another example. This road. Think there's wealth here? Yes, here too. Problem is bad distribution. We all can be rich but only a few are. To be rich, you only need one thing. What? No idea. Money, Felipe, money. Bad distribution. Only those with money can earn money. Aunt Elvira. Remember her? Say hello. He must be around. There... There it is. My Mom, was she like you? I was naughtier. Or so everybody says. She was a better student. Got a degree in education. Yeah, but how was she? She like movies? She paint her nails? She tell jokes? How would she be now? Would she criticize my stick-ons? Oh, they're very nice. You like them? I have many more. Look, here's one. What's this? A clock. I'm gonna show you something fun. Come. Look, this is from the wedding. And this is you, one summer. Look at this one. The house in Vitoria. They're rich. Very rich... cinemas, hotels. Even a ball court. Dad told me. If they're so rich, why are we so poor? Why don't I know them? I don't know. Yes you do. What happened? Your Dad hasn't told you? Neither will I. Elvira, we're waiting. Coming... - Can I keep it? - Sure. Antonio says it can't fail. Four...block. Your turn, Felipe. - What do you think? - I don't know. I don't know the business. Well, it's a guarantee, to draw future investment. Next month we get it all back... with profits. What happened? Sorry... What did you do? Aren't they rich? Why ask Aunt Elvira for money? What did you do? They won't talk... I won't talk to them. Why didn't they like Mom? Too poor for them? You're not gonna tell me? Listen, listen... I'm feeling your intoxicating perfume. HOW TO BECOME A MILLIONAIRE PLAYING FOOTBALL POOLS Felipe, don't bother me, please. I have a maddening headache. Goal in Alicante! Goal for Hercules! Hercules-Salamanca, 1 Mallorca-Valladolid, 1 Huelva-Sabadell, 1 Felipe... Felipe. Late this morning The Civil House of the Head of State officially announced the admission of Francisco Franco to the hospital for treatment of phlebitis in his right leg. Phlebitis can be fatal at his age. What'll happen? Someone at school said there'd be another war. Look, that could happen. Good morning. Identification, please. Yes... anything wrong? Go ahead. Thanks, good day. Asshole! Least he could do was answer you... and say good morning. It's not important. Yes, it is. He ignored your greeting. When you said goodbye, the same. Who the fuck is he? Felipe, don't talk like that. - Must've been nervous about Franco. - So am I. I've always lived near the sea. Why are we moving away? A city, Felipe. I've always said, we'd live in a city. A province capital with parks, avenues, pools, good schools and a cathedral. Perfect for someone like you. Bullshit! We're two vagabonds. Me, a vagabond? Calling me a vagabond? Really think I'm starving to death? Let's see, think a starving man could drive this car? Answer me. Could a starving man own a car like the President of France? Must I remind you who I am? Remind you? My own son? Yeah, remind me. Don't you remember when I sold gas stations? Station. And Forzacao? Right, two months drinking chocolate. What about the mushrooms? Forget that company too? Bye, good day. Bye, good day. Wasn't that the city? Where... We're going to a place better than the city. It's the future. The philosophy of residential areas...like America. Living near the city, with its advantages and none of the disadvantages. Alright, OK! Can't you see I'm a stranger here? Why don't we stop and ask? Me? Ask? You're kidding. I ever get lost? Thanks. Sorry for staring...that look reminds me of another person. Still here? What are you waiting for the fruit to rot? Lady, lady. She's a subordinate... Subordinate? She's my niece. And I'll treat her the way I please. Let's go. Move, Paquita. And your wife? Tell me something about her. What do you want to know? She died. Suddenly I was a widower. With a 2-year-old on the street. On the street? What's the relation? It's a long story. Why does someone like me fall for men like you? Men like me, how are they? My aunt's gonna kill me. That'll end, Paquita. When I leave here, you're coming too. That's it... That's the way men like you talk. You don't know how much I've brought. Esparragus, peas, mayonnaise sausages, everything. Let's see. Thanks Paquita, but you have to take it back. Forget it. She'll never miss it. Are you stealing from your aunt? Stealing to eat is not a crime. Here. Want an ice cream? No, sorry. I can't allow this. I won't be an accomplice. Do you have money? No. So there. If you were rich, I wouldn't steal for you. Here eat this ice cream before it melts. Paquita, take it back. - Think were're vagabonds? - We're poor, so what? Ain't so bad. But... We're poor? Don't be silly. Cancer, right? Only Cancers react like that. Come one, take it. Well, but don't think... Know how some London friends earn a living? They let people make long distance calls at half price. Flat was always full of South Americans. What happened with the bill? Nothing. They didn't pay it. Later when the line was cut, they'd move to another flat and start again. Great idea! Why don't more people do it? It'd work like a charm here, with the seasonal workers. I'd never do that. No. Though I'd have reason to. I sure spent money on phones as an artistic agent. Amalia, I sent the money. Get on line, please. Honey, I sent it three days ago. No idea. Try the post office. Spain awaits the recovery of its Caudillo, whom we see last summer practicing one of his favorite sports. - How much? - Hundred pesetas. - Good bye. - Bye. Next! Hi. The sheets are stuck. Come. Ah, there. Your Dad's about to arrive. Come. Can I ask you something, Paquita? Depends... No, forget it. Come on, tell... Nothing, it's just that. What? I've never kissed anyone. How's it done? You don't have a girl. Why are you curious? I'll need to know for when I do: Right, come here. You're naughtier than your Dad. Like this... No, not like that. What do you mean, not like that? Here, sit down. Now, this way. Lips parted a little more. There... Your Dad. Happy birthday. Congrats, Felipe. For he's a jolly good fellow, he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which no one can deny. Very well. Look, fifteen years, fifteen candles. My present was better, wasn't it? No secrets. Let's eat the cake and go. They cut the phone line. Come. I'm coming. What do you think? It isn't amazing, but not bad, right? The key was having the phone connected, you see. Magnificent, you were great! Antonio, you smell of cognac. You'll wake up Felipe. Don't worry. He sleeps like a log. Wish I could see him. It's late though. You'll see him, Estrella. Sure you'll see him. Estrella... Antonio, no. Estrella... Antonio, no... Why you dressed like that? My Dad's idea. What's up? Francos's recovered. He's left the clinic. Color TV, wow! Let's go, Felipe! Bravo! Bravo! Between acts. Paquita. Really? Sit up, Felipe. We'll see her later. Wanna keep still? Can't you keep still for a second? Can I say hi to Paquita? Keep still. I thinking she's looking for us. What, don't say hello anymore? Paquita! Why didn't you tell me you were coming? Enjoying it? You like that woman? I like her. Can't deny it. - She has a voice... - What can you expect from a Cancer? I don't understand. I'm tired. Give me the car keys. I want to rest. The keys? Yeah, sure. What are you doing? Sit down, sit! Quick, come with me. It's important. Come, are you deaf? What's eating you? Have you gone crazy? Hush and get in. Paquita: an explanation! What are you doing? What are we doing? We're running away. And there's no turning back. I've stolen money, a lot of money. I've stolen from the box office and cafeteria. What? You have to pack. We're splitting. This is getting exciting. His name is Bernabe. Well, go back up and return Bernabe. Forget that. He'd die. Look, one thing's stealing from Auntie. Another is holding up theaters. Let's see if we can fix things. What do you mean? We're returning the cash register. Do what you want... but think it over. I feel your intoxicating perfume and your voice murmur sweetly... There's not even 200 pesetas. Why did I listen to you? How could I listen to a nut like you? You want to go back? Yeah, and what do we say? Oh, we robbed your register and are returning it cause its empty. Paquita, did you want to finish me off? I don't need any help for that. Don't cry, say something. Answer, at least. I did it for love... For love. I had to stop you from running off with that singer. Now, you can't do without me. You're in my hands. You're crazy. Yes, I am... but I'm with you. I'm sorry, Paquita. That's it, good. Estrella has a sugar daddy. She'd never come back with me. She has expensive tastes. I'm not made for women like that. My specialty is petty thieves. My stomach's turning. Felipe, give me a hand. One, two, three... Good night. - Is this yours? - Uh, yeah. My wife must've dropped it. She feels indisposed. And this bird? It's dead. Oh, poor Bernabe. My wife'll be very upset. Who thought of putting the cage there with the windows wide open. Must've felt like a hurricane for the birdy. Sure your wife's OK? Sure, she's fine. Don't worry. Identification, please. Mom, you almost finished? These men are waiting. Felipe, my son, can you bring me some paper? Good night, madam. Have a good trip. And watch for the bird next time. Come on, let's go. Now, what do we do? What do we do? Keep going... it's all we can do. Looks more like your girl than mine. Wanna play? You want to? Miranda... A dollar. How did I know? I should've framed my first dollar. Isn't that what they do in films? These American bases are a fine idea. Can't understand all the protesting. I'm coming. Be right there, Felix. - Want to come to the base or not? - Sure I do. Good morning. Give way. Here everything's like the U.S., even traffic lights. Even Coca Cola. Do you know they import Coke from the States? A Hercules. Now you'll see Main Street. The church is used by all, first one religion, then another obviously. Look at the cut-rate store. Hairdressers, cinema. Nothing's missing. They even have their radio station. Impressive! It's time for lunch. And the homes, you said you'd show us the homes. - And the meat? - Everything is brought over, the meat too. It's not only better, it's cheaper. I have an idea... The colonel's my friend. Should be no problem getting you a pass. Any contacts in the cut-rate? Supermarket? They're my clients. Why? For the meat? Exactly, the meat. Look...three dollars. You see? In my family, we're born businessmen. Golf balls, 200 pesetas. See what I mean? It's not the same. Of course not. My deal's bigger. - Call it Import/Export. - Call it contraband. Not allowed, I told you. Will you help me or not? What...feel better? Where do the cigarettes go? Behind, Import/Export, Felix. My Dad's crazy, mad. He thinks you can be a millionaire overnight. I'm Felipe. Yeah, like Felipe Il, an ancient king or emperor, not sure. You're beautiful, Miranda. You can't understand me so I can say anything. I'd love to kiss you. I love your lips. I want to touch you everywhere. Yes, love, my idiot Dad. How the fuck do I play the machine? Look, I'm doing business and you're worried about the machine. I'm fed up with your business. The meat was going to be a good business and we were nearly poisoned. Look, the mistake was... well, there were buyers. I just didn't have time to find them. And meat is a perishable product. Perishable product...rotten meat. Yeah, but once fool, twice wise. From now on, no more perishables. Remember these words: non-perishable products. See that box? Peeled sunflower seeds. New! Peeled seeds? You could've bought washers, fridges. Don't you know they sell all at half price when they leave? That's a good business. What do you know? Stick to golf balls. I do the business here. That's for sure. See, this man gives you two dollars. What if he made ten calls? Mutual trust, essential for all business. Some business! What? You want me to sell things second-hand? To become a rag vendor? I'm just saying there are better businesses than peeled seeds. Keep hanging. Probably think you'll grow that way. Filipo no, Fe-li-pe. Five balconies, no less than five. Two of them overlooking the river. Look at the view, Felipe. And the phone? Forget the phone. That's the past. Now it's the buy-sell business. - Rag-vendor. - It was a figure of speech. But our lives will change. Before the house was full of people wanting to use the phone. Now it'll be fridges and TVs. Exactly. It's only the beginning. Cars, hear me? American cars. What's Miranda? - A soft drink? - Yeah. What? Antonio, I told you. One thing is fridges and washers. Another is foreign cars. The police have received a complaint. Why'd you get mixed up in this? Now what? You must disappear. Felipe, Felipe... You eat? Eat something. Then get dressed and pack. Leaving again? Yes. Help me with the boxes. Why? Help me. Choose a TV. Tell me at least what happened. That was Logro√±o, next is Vitoria, then Bilbao. After that? Where we going? Sleepy? Me too. OK, we pull over at the next stop. Where we going? Good night. ID card and Family Book. Family Book, too? It's the law. Take the stairs on the right. Thanks. Antonio Lozano Zalduondo. Police. You're under arrest. Ten minutes to freshen up, and pack your things. Life Insurance. Beneficiary Felipe Lozano Sanchez. Guaranteed capital: 25 million pesetas. Thanks. Good morning. Can I call my son? Don't worry. They'll take care of him. I'm Uncle Jorge. You eat yet? This kid hasn't eaten for hours. Bring him something. What? Croquettes, eggs, sausages, whatever fast. And you shower and clean that. Angel, send someone to this address. Take note. Empty your pockets, please. Count this. Norms. Remove your clothes. My wife. I remember her, Antonio. Remember perfectly. Can I keep it? Sure, no problem. Thirty-eight. - Mr. Lozano? - Come in. You're tense, Antonio. Relax. It doesn't hurt. It's not the first time. You're thinking everyone who passes here returns. Truth is, I didn't expect you. Well, that's better. Now, let's see grandma. - Good morning. - Morning, Ernesto. - They're in the garden, sir. - Very well. Come, Felipe. Help me, Benita. Come. Don't be afraid. Give me a kiss. I'm your grandmother. You're my grandson. They're finger-licking good. We thank thee O Lord for these Thy gifts which we receive... Amen. You can eat now. Splendid, Felipe! Getting to know one another, eh? Luis is my nephew. He'll help you study. Right, Luis? Yes, Father. Behind in your studies? We'll fix that soon. Luis is first in his class and has spare time. Right, Luis? Yes, Father. Sorry, Father. Felipe, your grandmother's calling. Come, my son. Sure you're interested in knowing the land of your ancestors. He was Felipe. Like you. He was the founder of the factory. I don't think the factory interests Felipe. He'd prefer the cinemas and handball court. Tomorrow you keep grandma company. See you at Rosary. I'm sure you need it. Your Dad's clothes. His room. Antonio Lozano. He was talented. What happened? Come to bed. Tell me what happened. Your Mom was ill, very ill. What your Dad did, he did for love. And something done for love can't be bad. What did he do? He kept money that wasn't his. A client's money, to pay the clinic. Think that's stealing? Good night, Felipe. It's not the best bedroom for someone your age, but... See you, tomorrow. Good night. This suit is new. Let me see your shoes. Very nice. I thought you only liked sneakers. And the tatoos? Erase them? How are the people inside? Good. I'm lucky. I'm with political prisoners, students, union organizers. Very clean and educated. Not common criminals. They're elsewhere. Those have real tatoos. Not like yours. Why erase them? Need anything? Uncle Jorge says he'll handle all. Right. He treat you well? What do you think of them? Well, I suppose you know all. They probably said I was a thief. And why not believe them, given the place I'm in. Well, I always wanted you to feel proud of me. In business, Felipe, you must always be on top. Trust no one. Temptation lurks everywhere. And unfortunately... Grandma, you OK? She fell asleep. Always the same, whenever she gets in the car. And this lad? The lady's grandson. He lives outside. For a minute, I thought you were your father. It was like 30 years ago. When your Dad was your age, he accompanied me to the Rosary. Let me, let me... Very well. Slowly. That's it. Very good. It's a clipping from ABC. Estrella? Alvarado? Why change names? I thought Pinseque was fine. Sounded nice, classy. But Alvarado... Maybe for a bullfighter, not a zarzuela singer. Now she sings Spanish songs. Says at the bottom, "The New Voice of Spanish Song." Alvarado... what's the point? What are you thinking? Listen, Felipe, you want to live here? I mean, with your uncles? You could study in a good school. You'd never need anything. Your not serious. Your education is paramount. Look at me... here in jail. Shit, you're not gonna be here forever. Prefer me to wait or go with them? My brother and his wife love you like a son. Don't think about it. It's better for everybody. But, do you want me to wait or not? Who cares what I want? OK, again. The derivative of the function at X is the tangent of the curve at said point. Understand, right? What's the matter, Felipe? Not in the mood? But it's very easy, it's just you don't pay attention. The tangent and derivative are the same. And you shut up, you're making him dizzy! Shut up! Shut up, goddammit! But... Where are you going? Come here. Suck my cock or I'll belt you one. You deaf? Suck my cock or I'll belt you. - Congratulations on the kid. - Thanks. - Good luck. - Thanks. We're leaving. What are you doing here? I came to pick you up. Leave and don't follow me. Get in the cab and go back home. Come. Let's go. Let me, let me I'm leaving jail, not the hospital. Antonio! What are you thinking? Come, give me the car keys. BARGAIN Come, I'll show you. Antonio! It's not great, but... I've brought mattresses, chairs, a table... Like the army barracks. With the TV, check the antennas. It's no Citroen, but it rides. That door leads to the garage. Thanks, Felix, pal. I don't know how to thank you for everything. Tomorrow at seven. EMPLOYMENT Good afternoon, madam. Excuse me for intruding, but we have a watch promotion. No, thanks. Felipe, Christmas menu. Consome, tuna salad and nougats. Shit, the gas went out. Christmas menu: tuna salad and nougats. I wish you a Happy New Year and may God grant Spain and all of us what we all wish: unity and peaceful coexistence. Good night. Turn the TV off? Yeah, turn it off. Your present. Shouldn't have bothered. Don't worry. I didn't have to pay. Now I sell watches, door to door. Thanks. Thanks a lot. What, don't you like it? No, it's not that. Of course I like it. Then? Well, I couldn't... I have nothing for you. Five minutes. If you're not here in five, I'm gone. OK, OK. It can't be Felix. Wait, wait. Let's see if he leaves. He would've called my name. Coming. Sorry, I was sleeping. Are you Antonio Lozano Zalduondo? What's up? Are you Antonio Lozano Zalduondo? No, it's my father. It's important, from Court. A moment. I'll get the key. Is it the police? No, please. Not again. Hide in the garage. About time. You have to sign a few things. I'm a law officer. Your father must appear in court. He's required for testament proceedings. An inheritance, says it here. Someone in Vitoria has died. Your grandmother, I suppose. Sign here. If my father were disinherited, it would say so? Of course. Well bye, and sorry about your grandmother. Thanks. Shit! We're rich! You just inherited half the cinemas in Vitoria! Dad, you can come out! Have you seen my Dad, Carmelo? Took the car a minute ago down the canal road. I don't know what happened. Ground was wet. The ball. Sorry for staring, Miss, but that look...it reminds me of another person.
