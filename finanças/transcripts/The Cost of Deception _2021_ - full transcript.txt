That the government Ines to maintain support even during the municipal elections on October 1. My father once told me there 're two kinds of people in this world. Those who give... and those who take. Any news in Bratislava? Take the car, and get the guys together. My father says those who give... sleep better. But those who take... rule everything. Don't rush. I need to call the PM. I always knew where I wanted to belong. Until tonight. SEPTEMBER 2006 BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS THE COST OF DECEPTION Why do we buy certain products and choose certain brands? Advertisers are trying to find an answer to this question. There's no simple answer. But there's a super method which helps advertisers: focus groups. Until the 1940s, market research was mostly about quantity. Pollsters looked at how much companies sell from a product. However, during World War ll, all this changed. American researchers wanted to find out how war propaganda affected people. Instead of a large-scale poll, researchers interviewed people in smaller groups. Instead of quantity, the new method focused on people's choices and thoughts. Focus groups won't tell us how many sellers sell a certain product, but they do tell us more about those who buy it. Am I a fool for hoping for even a tiny bit of spark in them? I told you it won't be easy. When you taught us, the hall was full, and we didn't play Snake... Maybe you're too covered up. You know I'll tell you if I can hire you full-time. I know. And I'm thankful for that. You know what I always say: Consultants starve in peacetime... and crises earn them shitloads of money. Hey! Watch where you're going! Here's your burger. Thai Chicken... - Medárd. - Hmm? - Have you checked your inbox? - Yeah. - Not bad. Who are the sources'? - It's there. I could tell you but they want to stay anonymous. So we got a broadcast from TG. It needs formatting, and grammar's awful too. Sure. Nándi... you've written it well. You say that the cabinet lies to Brussels about the budget numbers. It's not me saying it. Please correct the TG material. Yeah, and... A new dodgem opened in the Amusement Park. We need a clip of that too. Okay. Horse breeding. Use that one. Hello. I doubt they'd find it interesting... Réka, hi! That's your best article, don't shy away. Tell him Réka! They came over after work for a drink. Medárd and... Lilla? We're trying to set off his career. Honey, this is Réka. She works with Endre. That Endre. Hi. She's pretty. He said "Horse breeding! Use that one." You should get a Pulitzer for it. - Are you done? - I am. You should be glad we're getting along. You're getting along only because I work for Endre. Come on. He just wants a good work mate. And he's teaching me. He might hand over his position too. You check his shitty grammar... and fetch lunch for him. You're his intern at this point... or his delivery man. What did I say? I didn't mean that you're not going to be a better reporter than him. What you meant is that he came over to ask about your boss. I get it. No... just... Can't you see? What? That you go above and beyond. And they just look us down. Me maybe. But not you. That's not true. They don't see me as you do. To them I'm just a country girl, nothing more. I work for Endre? Sure. But I'm still just a country girl. Lucky I'm into country girls. Do you think... Endre sees me as a talent? Or just...? I'm sure he'd be over the moon if he had a shot. There's no one like you. Goon... Not this. Okay... this too. Leave it. Let me skip it. It's Endre. It must be important. Yeah, sure... Hello, Endre? Réka, I know it's late but if you want, you could come. I'm at the boss's. And... is it important? I don't know. I've just invited you to the PM's house. HI introduce you to some people. You decide. Go, I'll be fine. Leave me be, would you? Come on. You must join us. I can't... I'll have the kid with me. What kid?! - Where did Klára say it'd be? - In Valencia. So what kid? Are you keeping it a secret from him? It's his own. That's right. His own. Do I know the woman? He's already in work mode. So this year you knocked someone up just to have an excuse? Just kidding. As a father I've got to stand by him. - Bring them too. - There? Please don't. Cut it out already, would you? A decent family man skips Valencia. So how many are coming? If the boss gets good news from Moscow, a lot. First let's wait for the election results. Aren't we doing good? Supposedly. Speaking of Moscow... In the press conference held after Putin's and Gyurcsány's meeting the president called Hungary a... They talked in private? The usual. Klára too? - We got the green light. - Already'? Can I have my scoop? What? Minister... Not now. Endre. Zoli. Stay here. - Bandi. - Gyuri, you look awful. Klára. How much time do we have? They plan to play it at the rally. Less than eight days. PM's voice: All I say is, everyone take a deep breath, drink hell a lot of wine, sleep a couple of nights, and decide for themselves... If everyone can only say the things that were said in the last years... There is not much choice. Because we have fucked up. Not a little but a lot. No country in Europe has fucked up as much as we have. It can be explained. We have obviously lied throughout the past 18 to 24 months. It was clear that what we were saying was not true. We are beyond the country's possibilities to such an extent... that we could not conceive earlier... that a joint government of the Socialists and the liberals would ever do. And in the meantime we didn't do anything for four years. Nothing. You cannot mention any significant government measure... that we can be proud of, apart from the fact... that we got governance out of the shit. Nothing. If we have to give an account of the last four years, what then? THE OLD LADY NEXT DOOR SMILED AT ME TODAY. HURRY BACK, OR I'll CALL HER OVER. Fancy a smoke? My boyfriend would kill me. I don't see him here. Uh-Oh. Réka, arrange the focus group scheduled to September for the morning. - What? The morning? - And we need the questions. - But I can't... - You wanted a task. Sure but... it's past midnight. It's impossible to arrange a political focus group for the morning. Then feel free to go downstairs and tell them. I'll drive you back to the office. My briefcase is at your feet. Apologies. In it, there's a folder. The page on the left shows the popularity of the government sent to the press. And those are the actual data. - Uhh... - Yeah... it's normal that after a parliamentary election popularity drops. This much? No, not this much. But they made many resolutions before the elections, and Nirvana never came. So, as I understand it, there's a crisis now? Let's just say we got ourselves a fat project. And I'm counting on you. Oh shit. Okay. Boo, please don't be mad but I need to stay. I know it's 1am... but Endre needs me. Guess what! I got myself a whole political polling job! Yes, I know it's the middle of the night, and this is very last minute. You're right, but... Hey! Today at 10am. Great! Réka. Thank God! I'm glad I don't have to do it on my own. - What? - Organizing the archives. All the bills! Seems endless. Oh, that's not why I... - That's a pity. - Sorry. - Lili. - Yeah? Do you have a brush? - Morning. - Good morning. You did a great job. Well... It took a litre of coffee and about a thousand calories. - It's your fault if Nándi complains. - Please tell them to come in. I want to be over with it as soon as possible. But wasn't it... Please help Lili with the archives. She can't do it all by herself. Sure. Just... I've read the questions. They're perfect. Fuck. Good morning. What I've already told you... Thank you for being available under such short notice. Please introduce yourselves briefly... Not even a word. He gave me some tasks but we haven't spoken since. What tasks? Whatever. It's nothing. Why do you think the intelligence minister was so tense last night? Drop it, okay? I want to show you something. I got this at work today. Germany's far away. It's a scholarship. I'd still be living here. Of course, I have to get in first... What do you think? Have you applied yet? No. Don't know what article I should submit. The one on horse breeding. All I'm asking is to keep your eyes open. - You're using me. - I'll make it up to you. Forget it. MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS - Réka? - Endre, hi. I'm sorry for calling so late. Just wanted to know how it went? I'll call you back. Okay, sure, I just thought I'd ask... Next time please let me know if you wanted to use the observation room. I'm sorry, I just... You know you can trust me. You know I do. But that's irrelevant. See you on Monday. Réka, hey. - They're here. - Who? - Your folks. - Shit... - Okay, got it, I'll amuse them. - No, wait. - Tonight I'm not going anywhere. - But they came for you. Nándi, tell them I can't. Please. Peek-a-boo. Where's Aunty? Shit, Attila, I'm having a shower! We thought you were ready. I'm sorry, I can't make it today. I worked late, I'm barely alive. - We set the date a week ago. - I'm sorry. I didn't plan this. Réka. You're fine as is. Jeez, could you just get out? We asked for one evening. - What is it? - She's tired. And I asked you to get out. - But if you just do your make-up... - Dad! I'm not going. I'm sorry, not today. It's your godson's first fucking birthday. - Hey, watch your tongue. - Would you get out at last? - Sorry. Hi, Réka. - Hi, Kata. Why won't you come? Because... Here. I had no time to wrap it yet. I'm truly sorry, but I really can't play family today. Okay. Have fun at work. Dad, come. We're late. I'll make some tea. Show the blue lights. I can sell them all. There're some brand new, those are trendy now, but if you listen to me, you'll buy state-owned. I can help you get 20-25 apartments. So? Want to have a view from the Danube Bank? And District 13 is the new Buda Hills. Good evening. Róbert. Szilárd. What's wrong, Rob? Gentlemen, see you tomorrow. Don't make dinner reservations. Interrogation starts at 9.40pm, 16 September 2006. People present are Lieutenant Szilárd Major, and... And Róbert Jakab, suspect. I inform the suspect that at the Parassapuszta border crossing a commando unit captured a Mercedes lorry in the evening of 14 September 2006. The driver was interrogated as a witness. In the vehicle they found 23 tons of goods imported for charity reasons. Shortly after that, National Security Service recorded a call from a Slovak businessman who's been under surveillance for years. "Chinese didn't arrive, nobody says a word in Pest, Softy won't pick up." Any idea who Softy could be? What time did you say it is? 9.40pm. And you are here with me. - I'll tell you who I think he is. - 9.40pm. I'm sure my wife's already put away the roast beef. She's put the kid to bed, and worries why I'm late. You have the right to make a call. Who'd you call? - My solicitor. - No. Do you have a wife? How does it feel to know that a man like me is more expected home than you? If I were you, I'd be a workaholic too. Keep doing this, and don't cooperate. But then the beef will rot, and your kid'|| grow up without you. Smuggling in a highly public non-profit organisation. Selling of goods imported for charity, embezzling billions of forint... You'd get at least 8 years for these. Szilárd... Let's go home. What if I told you that you'll get a call in ten minutes from a Captain or a Colonel to tell you the captured lorry isn't enough to keep me in. Would you believe me? Would you? The... organisation you talked about is a highly public non-profit business because I do it with people you call "General"... or "Minister". Your Boss who talked shit about this country you serve... You think if I'm behind bars, this country will be a better place. But even if you can keep people like me inside, which I seriously doubt, this north-Balkan swamp will collapse like a house of cards. After 24 minutes, DVSC fans... Menya, do you want another? God no... Maybe one. Hey- Guys, what can I get you? She was here first. She can wait. I'm sow. We've got tap ale, Ászok... I'll take an Ászok. - Béla, hi! You're a good boy! - Béla! Come here. Réka's busy now. At least he still recognises you. 'Hope your work's okay. I see... I shouldn't have come. 200 forints. What did you expect? That I'd hug and kiss you for apologising? I'm just trying to... I get it. You're trying to build a wonderful career. Nobody's got a problem with that. We only asked you to get out of your boss's ass for one bloody night. Endre's got nothing to do with this. I was upset. You know what? I'll make it up to you. Can I come over? We already have plans. We're having a cartoon night. - Can I have a lemonade? - Sure. Hello? I've got an idea what was the secret meeting about... MTV now! Can I have the remote please? -Good evening. In a recording... Seriously? - Shut up! - That was leaked today, the Prime Minister said, and I quote, “We've obviously lied throughout the past 18 to 24 months. We didn't actually do anything for four years.“ The speech was held at a Socialist party meeting, and published online by The Hungarian Radio. There is not much choice. Because we have fucked up. Not a little but a lot. No country in Europe has fucked up as much as we have. It can be explained. We've obviously lied throughout the past 18 to 24 months. We reached the PM at the Autumn Festival in Győr. It's a spiral of lies. .. You watching it? That the whole Hungarian political elite got into. From this trap, the left-wing parties... “PM's self-criticism.“ Come on! Are you still there? If your boss is involved in this... What was in your focus group? What were the questions? ENDRE OFFICE +11. - Hey. Night shift? Yeah, I mean no, I just left something in... my drawer. I'm still trying to organise the bills. Have you heard? - You know, this... - Yeah... Crazy. MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS SEPT 2006 - The secretary. - Yeah, I heard that too. - Is anyone else here? - Réka. She forgot something. You go home now. See you tomorrow. Found it? - What? - The thing you left here. Oh, that! Yes, I've found it. Bye. Bye. - Holy fuck. - Was I right? All the questions are about finding ways to leak the speech. If I break this, not only will I get the scholarship, but also a job at the BBC. It'll be made public anyway. I'm not so sure. Things like this usually aren't. Yeah, so it's up to us now. Up to you, actually. What's your problem?! Don't you see it'd hurt Endre? Honestly? I don't give a shit. This is bigger than him. He's not the one I'll expose. But... this doesn't make any sense. Why is a colleague leaking it? That speech could easily bust Gyurcsány. Why do you think I want to write it? Don't fuck up my chance. Help me. - He hasn't even hired me full-time. - See? If we go after this, you could 'persuade' them to get the job you want. The people have the right to the truth. Fine. I tell you... I'd also like to know... Just how and why it got out. Where next? So far so good. I'm thinking! I was told a dispatch rider took the tape to the TV Station. If we find out who he was, maybe we can get closer to the source. Is that your 'big plan'? You got any better? Well, I wouldn't call Endre to ask if he was involved in busting the PM... Then we go to the TV. Alright. I've already broken into my boss's office... It's your turn. Resignation! Resignation! The crowds been trying to break into the television building even though police forces try to stop them. They want to read their demands live on air. I see. So he didn't take off his helmet. Did anybody talk to him? I didn't see his face. He didn't say a word. Maybe 'hello'. He left it and went away. Didn't you ask about the recipient? I don't know. Didn't care. Bon appetite. Isti. What we don't get's that the man arrived, and no one asked "what for?" Like who was the delivery for? Nope. No idea. I've gotta go sort the storage room. Best return that Dictaphone... you borrowed a week ago. Okay, | will. Nándi. Nobody's gonna know anything around here. What do you mean? Thanks for the tissue. Ria, Ria, Hungária! Get the water hoses! Come on, hurry! Where's the key?! Where the fuck is the storage key?! - Any idea'?! - I've just got here! I have no idea. The mob charges again. But now they've suddenly stopped. Levi! Krisztián! We go out with the unit. Everyone, get your helmets! - Where's the exit'? - Follow me. Any answers yet? They won't re-deploy anyone to us. Now what? Who goes out? The Provincials could be sent out. But they've got no fucking shields or boots! There's nothing I can do. And the Regulars hang around at the Parliament?! And the PM's home... Fine. I'll go out with them. Unit! Shit luck. We're going out. Fuck! Oh my God! Nándi, please get us out! I don't know which exit's open... if any. Then find a way out! You work here! Alright. Stay here with the paramedics. I'll look. Hurry! They're asking the mob, with a megaphone, to stop throwing stones. Because ifs caused serious injuries. The safety wire on the windshield of the police car is broken... And the vehicle can't leave the scene, it's stuck. The policemen are defending themselves but they're stuck there. They can't get out, and the... They're cornered. They're stuck in that earl! And the mob lights it on fire. Oh my God... There're people in there... Was this pan of the plan? The burning car that's been put out... Me and my crew have to back away because the car'll explode. We must go further away. PARAMEDIC Could you help? Yes, you. Press it down firmly. The guys... Are they still out there? Colonel. With all due respect, I can't keep them out with this many men. If no backup comes... if I obey the order civilians and policemen will die. We have a problem. They poured petrol on the barricade, and they'll light it up. We cant put that out with water. Start the attack, or we'll die in here! Fm gonna withdraw all forces from this fucking building! Copy that. But he order is to stay there. There's nothing I can do. They've put it on fire!" Medan“! Channel 2! That's it. Medan“! - Nándi, you here? - Where's the exit? - All the gates are closed or blocked. - I don't know. It's a fucking mess! Those fuckers set my car on fire! - No gates open? - No clue. Maybe the one to Nádor Street. We need a paramedic here! Coming! SECURITY Excuse me, is there a Director or chief of security around here? - There. The director. - Thank you. Wait! Director, please... - Wait! - He's busy. But it's important. Director! I heard from injured policemen that there's no backup coming. If you called the PD, they might do something. He's on the phone with them. Understood. The Lieutenant Colonel told me they can't help. The police are giving up the building. What? Gyuri. - Who's it'? - You better have a car waiting for me. Juhász. You still there? Where the fuck would I be? The debates just ended. Where do I go? Can I send a car for him? Wait a minute. He said he's good there. Are you serious? - Where have you been'?! - Follow me. - The police are giving up the building. - No way?! I heard the Director say it! - Let's go. - What is going on here? Nothing. A bunch of assholes act like it's a revolution. But why not send backup for the police?! Let's move already! Fuck me. If it doesn't turn into a crazy mess. If it does, no way. Who agrees with Mátyás? The situation you described is quite absurd. I hardly ever agree with Mátyás but now I couldn't agree more. An anti-government protest is acceptable until... a violent, far-right wing mob seizes control of it. I see. Who agrees with Mátyás and Krisztina? Make a bigger scandal. What? "People's attention must be drawn to secondary issues..." "It must be diverted from real and serious social dilemmas... with news that has small social impact but is emotionally..." What do you mean? Endre doesn't want Gyurcsány to fail. He's helping him. They learned the speech was leaked, and somebody was going to publish it. Who? I don't know. But that's why the Minister of intelligence was so tense. Endre and the consultants figured out a way to divert attention from the speech. But this... Oh my God. I was the one who organised the focus group. Hey... Listen. Even if you did, nobody's going to think you're involved. Réka, listen to me. You're just an employee at a company that might be involved in the scandal. Let's copy the cassette. Are there any empty cassettes here? The guy with the bleeding head kept asking the paramedic if backup was coming... Listen. It's not your fault. We need a policeman who'd confirm what happened. Hey, where're you going? Leave me alone. What happened? My dad... If he hadn't retired last summer, he could've been there today. We need to find a cop. He must've had a reason for doing this. Who? Endre. Fuck Endre! Now we've got to prove that the police didn't send backup on purpose. They must've blackmailed him so he had to help them. Does your dad have connections? Nándi, if you write about this, I'll be a shelf-stacker for the rest of my life. This is the sentence I quoted. We can listen to it once we get the tape. It's not about the entire political elite lying for the last 16 years. You said, I quote: “We've obviously lied throughout the past 18 to 24 months.“ Because those last 18 to 24 months are my responsibility. So you admit... that in the last 18 to 24 months of your Prime Ministership, you've been lying to the voters? Let's just try to be... a bit more abstract. In this context, lying doesn't refer to... I LEFT EARLIER. MADE PANCAKES FOR BREAKFAST. LOVE YOU! Hey. Wrong time? - Not at all. - Great. So? [How to say this]? - Unthinkable things happened. - Indeed. And... I don't know what to make of them. Oh? I mean... you might have more insight... Réka, sorry, I don't have time for this. Do you need anything? I'm not sure... Last night... I wanted to tell you tomorrow. I had Lili prepare your resignation. [Can't we just]? Can't we just son this out somehow? What do you mean? What's all this about?! I thought we were polling, figuring out what voters think. Who they hate, who they like. I didn't know why... you left me out. You know I'm crazy thankful for everything you did for me. You recommended me at university, you hired me here. If I knew it's confidential, I'd never have watched it. How could I prove that you can trust me completely from now on? You had your chance. Next time rewind the tape. I understand. Was anybody with you? Who? He saw almost nothing. - I'll tell him to forget about it. - Who was it'? It's alright. Nothing major happened. I'll make him stop. I'll fix this. Just give me a chance. You'll make him stop? This is it. You brought your boyfriend here? The journalist? Endre, please... Trust me. Let me go home, and tell him that what we saw was a misunderstanding. Go. Really? - Call me as soon as you talk to him. - I will. Thanks. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Fuck me. POLICE DEPARTMENT Good afternoon. I'm looking for It. Szilárd Major. In what matter? I must speak with him. I work for National Television. I have some information on an investigation. You have? Correct. That's not how it works. Get an appointment. It's urgent. Wait there. Nándi, we have to talk... Come to the PD in District 5. I've found someone. Who? A cop. Excuse me. Lieutenant? I'm Nándor Szőke from National Television. Do you have a moment? No interviews. I wouldn't turn up out of the blue if I had another choice. - It's not an interview I want. - I'm on my way to lunch. I'll be quick. Can I join you? It's about troopers' safety. What I have to say... might make you want to leave. But please hear me out. Nándi, hi. Good afternoon, sir. - Nándi, we need to talk. - This is Réka Vincze. She's involved. What? No, I'm... Hello. Involved in what? We were there last night. Please hear us out. - I've got nothing... - Her father's a cop. Please. It was a close call that he wasn't there. Where does he serve? Vecsés. But he's retired. What happened yesterday... - was not right. - I know. You were on duty, right? We were in the TV Building. I'm an assistant editor there. - Nándi, please... - Sorry. - So... - How did you find me? You had an interview once on TV. I was hoping you might help us... This isn't an interview. I heard a police radio conversation the other night. Or rather she did. The commander begged for backup but the dispatch said... that he can't send any. Look, I've got nothing to... But outside there were, like, 200 troopers ready for action. I only heard the radio calls. I'm not saying that you or any of your colleagues made a mistake. We think you got an order... From above. I don't know where it came from. Calls kept coming from the TV building. "We need more men!" "Control the riot! Start the attack!" With so few men they couldn't control those... hooligans. Still, the riot police never came. We were told the Regulars were needed elsewhere. At the Parliament, at the party headquarters... and at the PM's house. Almost no one got directed to the TV building. These... radio calls are recorded, right? Your father's a cop so you must know what I'd get for this. - Trial in military court. - If he gets caught. "If." Of course I would. Couldn't you 'accidentally'... What was your father's rank? Sergeant first class. That's not too high. He's a troublesome... hot-headed, stubborn man. Or just always followed his conscience. What'd you do with the recordings? There were about 300 policemen. More than 200 of them suffered head trauma, got smoke poisoning, or had some other injury. We want them to know they weren't let down by other policemen. It would cause some cleansing up there if... these higher orders were published. I find that a bit naive. I'll think about it. That's my number. You think he'll call? I don't know. You wanted to talk. It's not important. - Hold on, Endre's just got in. - Who is this girl? Réka Vincze. We had no problem with her until now. Loyal as a puppy. So what changed? Your husband's worried about the rally. With good reason. If they organise it, so many will vote for them we'll definitely lose Demszky. We're working on it. I entrusted her with something a little too soon. Gyuri, you should vet the girl and her boyfriend. Don't vet but stop them. The guy's a journalist at National TV. How exactly did they find out? I made a mistake. The girl broke into my office. No need to make such a fuss. Half of the TV work for us, the other half's too scared to do shit. The guy's an intern, and he's applying for a scholarship abroad. And praises the freedom of the press. Does he have anything? I'm not sure. Okay. Then I'll call Zoli. No. You send a couple of guys there, and bring this intern in. We can't take any risks. And now the news... The parliamentary leader of the ruling party asked the opposition to calm their supporters. He added that they oppose any violence, and assured police of their support. Our reporter now joins us live from the scene... POLICE DEPARTMENT Gentlemen! I'm sure you all know this ain't gonna be a walk in the park. The events of last night can't happen again. Ask yourselves: What would you rather do? Patrol? Chase junkies and thieves? You may arrest them but nobody will remember it. However, today is a day that people'|| talk about for years. Every policeman serves their country, and protects the residents of Budapest tonight. There're 6,500 police officers in Budapest. Most of them serve their whole lives. Their backs hurt, their wives cheat on them, their kids fail in school. Their only joy is that they can be proud as a cop! Yo! True! - Louder! - Yo! And that pride was taken last night. Give them what they deserve. We stand up today as we should have last night. The rest will be told by the unit commanders. May God give you strength and health! Strength and health! First unit, to the vehicle! Second unit, to the vehicle! We have a problem. They poured petrol on the barricade, and they'll light it up. We cant put that out with water. Start the attack or we'll die in here! I thought he payed for your consultancy. Among others. He expects a call from the PM's office, and asked me to take it. He's busy with getting his tooth filled. But I assume that's not what you wanted to know. I need you to find someone. An analyst. - For what task? - Yours. They'll become pretty influential if they play along. And I want you to put the Liberal Party on hold. And get more involved. Until... we stabilise the position of the PM. What about Réka? Gyuri's already approved of this. The secretary of state'|| surely, too. So you want me... to quit one of the boss's best coalition partners? Look, he won't be PM for long if we cannot solve the crisis. I'll see you at the office tomorrow. Gábor Ham's phone. And Gergő... Work starts at 8am as usual. I'm listening... Holy fuck. You're working hard? Yeah. It has to be ready by the time we get the recordings. Then what? What do you mean? Where will you submit it? THE PERFECT TRICKI THE EXPENDABLE POLICE OFFICERS OF BUDAPEST I'm not naive. We need to talk. Yeah? I messed up. What? - Could you listen for a sec? - Sorry but... I'm listening. Go on. Endre knows. He knows we saw the footage, and you're writing that article. What? I didn't know what to do. He'd already found out. And he fired me. - I had to tell him. - Are you serious? We have to stop! Both of us! Réka, what the actual fuck?! You told him? When? - Who else knows? - I don't know. Why couldn't you tell me sooner? He's probably already alerted the whole gang! He promised not to tell anyone if I can convince you... You believed him? That man who's... messed up in this?! Réka. Can you tell me, calmly, what happened? I'm not asking as a journalist but as the idiot you're in love with. What happened? Please... drop the story. - Hello? - I have the recording. I'm at your address. Can you wait there? What? No. Fm kinda busy... Are you crazy?! You want me to put it in your mailbox? - That'd be great. - Are you insane?! Jeez. Come down now, or I'll fucking change my mind. Alright, alright. I'll be there in a sec. Wait here. - We'|| continue. - No, I'm coming too. Here. Does anyone know you made a copy? If you screw up, I'll never admit I gave it to you. Of course. Good luck. Know them'? Give me the car keys. - Nándi... - Give them! You said you'd stop. I said we'll talk about it. Give me the keys. No, this is over. Nándi! Nándor Szőke? Nándor Szőke? Yeah? I need your ID please. - For what exactly? - Your supervisor filed a complaint. Which one? Would you identify yourselves? One cannot be cautious enough. - Hey! He's bolting! - I can fucking see that! Nándi, please stop! Réka. You come with us. Move. We don't have the time... Shit! Nándi, this is insane... Come on! Half of the nation is in uproar. I've got a thousand problems... And now this idiot's running away. Réka. Is this what Endre taught you? Please, let me call him. I'll get him to stop. - Just don't hurt him. - Okay... Hugs and kisses to your boss. Nándi, all's going to be fine if you stop. They won't hurt you. Oh, so you're in the car with them?! Fucking hell, Réka! This is insane. I want to help. Yeah, sure. I take it he didn't listen. Please, let's just stop, I'll convince him. What? No one will publish your article... after this. They have connections. There's no chance, not even abroad. I'll try anyway- And I'll write about this chase, too. Ask where's he headed. What's the plan? Where are you going? Good question. It depends. The tank's full. I won't stop till Berlin. Nándi, stop it, I'm begging you! - Réka, I'm... - I love you! Disappointed in you. There's no time for this. Ram it off the road. What? No! Please don't! - Open the door! - Hey, stop! Let me out! - Open it! - Calm down! Fuck... - Stop! - Nándi, you idiot! - Get him out. - Please help him! Calm down! He's not here. Hey! You there! - You trashed my car! - Go back to the car. Lajos, for fuck's sake, I need your help. Right now? Yes. Wrong time? - I'm handling the rally. - I need you to trace a mobile. When? Now. Send me the number. The boys will do it. Sorry. There's a situation. - It's alright. I'll order another... - We're done here. You know your lines and the phone number. I do. But you haven't told me why I need to cross the Slovak border for this. No need to know. - Why can't I use a booth? - Róbert. I'm serious. Leave the thinking to us. What if they recognise my voice? It's taken care of. The call's an excuse. It'll be deleted. Nándi, pick it up! Goddamnit! Is he asleep? - No, not yet. - Will you let me in? - You're here? - Yeah. - How come'? - Wrong time? No, of course not. Come. The riot was not over with that. Troopers kept using tear gas on Oktogon. Casualties complained about extreme and unreasonable police actions. This time no policemen were injured. I'm sorry. He couldn't sleep all day. Stan the dishwasher when you're done. You couldn't reach him since? Are you... Are you safe? Yes. Or rather not. I don't know. [Don't you know someone]? I don't. If you listen to me, you cross fingers that he comes back in one piece. And you beg your boss for another chance until he takes you back. I don't want to work for these people anymore. You chose this. Why do you need to make me feel that you're somebody, and I'm nobody who just gives you trouble? Because, unlike you, I know how certain things work. You do? Then tell me. Tell me which one of us was there with the injured policeman. I clearly don't understand what's going on. It's one thing to know, and another to try to do something about it. You? Alone? Or Nándi, that know-it-all intern, who's playing the hero? By getting himself fired? And arrested? I want you to stop because people've been taken for much less. Simply because they're in the way. Hey, there's no Communism anymore. There's a cop who's helped. Jesus fuck. The last thing to do now is to go to the police. - It's different. He helped. - With what'? Gave out some radio calls?! See? That's why I'm treating you like a kid. Because you act like one! Go fuck yourself. Béla, It's okay. Come on now. - We didn't do anything! - We did nothing! Run! Get down on the ground! On the ground! On the municipal elections on the 1st of October. But as a political consultant and analyst, you surely have an opinion. Look... The we/I-organised attempt to overthrow the government, the not that was the result of the provocation by the opposition, created an extremely unstable situation. Endre. - What's all this? - You alright? - What the hell is going on? - Come in. Maybe he did something you don't know about. Look, the police has to protect the order in this tumultuous situation. Don't bullshit me. Is everything okay, Endre? Sure, honey. Go back to bed. Réka! I haven't seen you in ages. Hello. Sweetheart. Go back to bed. Let me make some tea for Réka. Not now. I said go back to bed. What happened? Get your coat. What do you want? To know what I know? Or to meet people who know even more? Just get my brother out. He didn't do anything. The whole country's protesting. Everyone wants their heads. Don't you think they'd do anything to stop them? Like in your case. That's what happens when you don't stay home. I can't get him out. Just... go home. You would? You'd go home? For a start, I wouldn't have been so nosy. You left me out of everything. All I wanted to know was what's going on. I did it for a reason. I wanted to protect you. Went well... This is the shittiest day of my life. Réka. You must go. We can't talk anymore. - Why can't you get him out? - Because it's all chaotic now. There're more important things at stake than a few protesters. - He wasn't protesting! - That doesn't matter. We really can't win against the opposition without arresting innocent people? What opposition? Don't you get it? - I do. - No, you have no idea what's going on. Do you smoke? What? One of my clever former students recently started her lecture with "Why do we buy certain products and choose certain brands?" Not only advertisers want an answer for that but also politicians. Let me introduce two notions here. There're sales-orientated parties. And there're market-orientated parties. A sales-orientated party works like this: Here you go, this is me. My packaging's blue, I have lots of tar, nicotine, and also a filter. I taste a little bitter. The question this party asks is: This is me. How can I get the most people to stand behind me? The market-orientated party doesn't say... what kind of party they're. It asks: What do I need to be to get the most people to stand behind me? What should my packaging look like? What about tar and flavour? Which one sells more? Now, I'm no big fan of the PM and his wife, but they understood this. Two years ago the governing party was like the first pack. It was alright. But the people got fed up with the packaging and the bitter taste. The "Management" felt that if they go on like this people'|| quit smoking. They panicked. "How are we going to sell our pack in the next election?" The 'old guards' moaned but none understood what Gyurcsány did. He said to all those big shots: We shouldn't tell people what we're like. Let them tell us what they want us to be. Gyurcsány wanted a market-orientated party. At first, he was told to fuck off. Then they realised... If they want to win the 2006 election, they need him. All who opposed, started to support him, and he started to reform the cigarette factory. And from a well-established but outdated Socialist Party... he created a modern, fashionable brand. But there's a problem. When a company asks "What should I be like?" to get more customers, they'll need resources. To promise without resources that you'll keep gas prices low, do a five-year tax cut project, and give out a 28th-month pension, you'll have to be bold. They realised too late that after winning the election they wanted so bad, they'll go bust and bankrupt. - That's why he told the speech. - Correct. To tell them, they can't burn any more money because a seven-year-famine's going to come. When the party leadership realised that he'd bankrupt not only the factory but also the country, they stopped supporting him. "Get him the fuck out before he ruins everything." "He fucked up, not us." Is that how the speech got leaked? They couldn't decide... who should publish it. Then Gyuri found out that the speech probably got to the opposition. They knew what they wanted to do with it. Publish it before the municipal elections. Probably. But, because this "wonderful" man... or rather his wife and mother-in-law have connections, they became aware of it, and moved faster. They published the speech, and still had enough time to blow up an almost civil war before the municipal elections. But this... makes no sense. Everybody hates them now. Yeah... in other places in the country. But in Budapest, where they can cause scandal, by letting police officers be beaten up, and allowing arson to happen, they've achieved something. A fascist mob on the streets of Budapest. Who do you hate more than a lying PM? That's why I told you not to fuck with these people. But after that speech... How can he stay in his position? When so many are against him in his own party? The Socialist Party? They'll be the first to join forces with Gyurcsány. They know if they fail now, there'd be a new election, and they'll lose. They've only one chance to stay in power. To stand by Gyurcsány, and keep Budapest in the municipal elections. Do you think it'd work? If they can prevent Fidesz from organising their rally, it could. If they can 'prevent'...7 In politics there are ways and means. I'm calling about the Fidesz rally planned at Heroes' Square. It's come to my attention that groups that may be associated with the Slovak and Hungarian underworld are planning an armed attack. A bomb will explode. Nothing will change. Everyone stands by Gyurcsány, and this remains for another four years until the parliamentary elections. Your brother won't be released until the fascist mob's needed in political 'negotiation'. I'm sow. Shit. I thought you were here. Kata... Where's Attila? He got arrested. I have to call Dad. Where are we going? What's the charge? POLICE DEPARTMENT Hey! Let her go! She didn't do anything! Okay. I see. Thanks anyways. Nothing. They're just pointing fingers. Did you tell them it's covered by CCTV? Even this wasn't enough. Come. I'll take you home. Let's go. Fidesz president told us on Wednesday that they'd hold their rally. Party leadership decided otherwise based on police and intelligence reports. National Security Service informed Fidesz leadership that they got a tip-off on a planned bombing. The country's turned orange. Except for Budapest, the coalition's failed. In many cities, which had a Socialist or Liberal mayor, elections were won by Fidesz. Budapest's won by then Mayor Demszky but only by a hair's breadth. The Socialists and Liberals will have only 33 members in the Assembly altogether. With the voting, the government's fate lies in the hands of the Parliament. If the majority votes... If they vote confidence, we'll continue our work. This no-confidence vote's not only about government politics, but also the PM himself. DON'T LOOK FOR ME Ferenc Gyurcsány's won no-confidence vote. This was the first no-confidence voting in the history of Hungarian democracy. Well, it's not like a suburban block flat. What are you doing here? I thought I'd see why you always cancel our lunches. I'm glad you're here. You can't let it go, can you? Nándi? No news? He's keeping a low profile. At least I hope. Would you show me how you teach? It really suits you. Stop. You were right. About what? Wanting to belong there. - No. Not at all. - You were. You should've. When I was your age, I only wanted to be the good guy. Refused the hush money. And the corruption. That was that. I've taken a bribe just once. 50 forints. You and Nándi wanted something more. Leave it. - Just too early. - Can't we just have lunch? - You can't do it without the tools. - Dad... Whether you teach at university, work for National Television, or serve as a cop, it's worth nothing if you can't get among them. Yeah. Okay. Is the buffet any good here? - If you can't get among them... - What'? What did you mean by that? In this country, you can't accomplish anything... unless you're 'in the room'. Let's grab lunch. - Tomika, don't forget our lunch. - I'll be there. - Réka? - Tamás, hi! I've never seen you here. There's always a first time for everything. I'm cold. - Coming to the sauna? - Yeah, sure. Not seen much of you lately. Yeah... Endre's been giving me independent tasks. I don't want to jinx it, but... The point is that I have good things going on. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I know, I'm just superstitious. And you know Entire... He has a thing for promises. He's been promising to get me my parliament-pass so that I don't have to call him every time I bring his documents. And no pass card yet, right? That's so like him. I've already told you that you should join us in Communications. Yeah... He's having this meeting with the big shots on... when exactly? Wednesday. - Yeah. And he asked me to bring in the charts. But you don't have your pass. Listen I could get you... Oh, no, it's not your job. It'll be a good reminder for Endre when his charts are not there. Come on, I'd be happy to help. It's just a phone call. Would you? This would be a life-saver. Of course. And Endre'|| owe me. Put your bag here. Through there, please. Excuse me. I must check your bag. Alright. Chewing gum! The wrapper is full of metal these days. I see. Good afternoon. Hey? Hi. I brought these polling materials to the meeting. Of course. Go ahead. Not now. Endre's assistant's here. Already? - Hello. - Hi. - Is Endre here already? - No, he's coming later. Hope it's good news. Oh, it's just statistical blah blah... The important things'|| be discussed here. When this mess is settled, I'll ask Endre... not to hide his colleagues. Yes... That would be nice. No worries. in my first two weeks working here, I kept getting lost too. You should go to the library. I'll see you there in 2 hours. So? What did he say? We're on our own. Fuck! He said he'd just talked to them. They're stopping resources if we don't son this out by November. Did he tell them it'd lead to national bankruptcy? That'd be bad for them too. They're already lobbying for an early election in Brussels. We're screwed. Soto avoid being kicked the hell out, we have to son things by November. - Endre, what're the results? - Fifty-fifty. There's constant dissatisfaction. Popularity is... I'm not going to lie, it hit rock bottom. The good news is that the communication works. Most of the public thinks that only far-right fascists, football fans and hooligans take part in a protests. You're forgetting that October 23rd is right around the corner. It gives people a good reason to protest. I totally agree. Memorial Day makes me worried as well. And they won't cancel it. There'|| be like 50,000 people in the streets. More like 120,000. Correct. On Astoria. I'm telling you, if they have the memorial on the 23rd, there won't be order by November. Just even more mess. What if somebody calls in again? You can't announce terrorist threat on every event. And they'd just postpone their demonstration. Endre... After the riots at the National TV Building... What were the numbers after the arrests? What do you mean? Has the willingness to protest decreased? Should we do it again but bigger? The city is full of fascists and hooligans... We could do some cleanup. That'd surely be big. After that I wouldn't demonstrate at all. But please correct me if I misunderstand the voters. It'd be all over the press. And not only in ours. - We could become a police state. - Doesn't matter. Just make is clear that there're fascists in the streets of Budapest. That's feasible. And the civilians? The crowds that go to the memorial? - What about them? - They could walk right into it. Collateral damage. Are there enough policemen who'd still do it? Were you a soldier? Team morale; a good commander... a few nights of no sleep, and some vodka. Gyuri, would you discuss it with Péter? We need to make sure the police can't be identified. If each of them gets separate lawsuits, we'll go crazy... Can we take ten? What? Why? I need a smoke. Fine by me. And the civilians? The crowds that go to the memorial? - What about them? - They could walk right into it. Collateral damage. Réka! She's in the stairwell. Here! Get the cars! Hey! Out of my WHY! She's on a delivery scooter. Resignation! Nándi? Boo, where 're you? Is that really you? I thought... - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Where are you? - At the university. Where you're supposed to be holding your lecture. - Why aren't you here? - Well... That's a long story. - Come here. - No. I mean... How many students are there? No clue. The hall's full. Since the riot, everyone tries to get into political classes. - Could you do me a favour? - Sure. Would you keep as many there as you can? I'll be there in ten minutes. - Sure, but... - Would you? And invite as many as you can. Teachers, students, the janitor, everyone. And your journalist buddies. Whoever you can. Everything okay? - You'|| see. Remember you said you were disappointed in me? - Eh... - Now you won't be. To the uni. It's faster that way. Sure... Sorry, just my boyfriend... he called again, we're meeting today. Good for you. He's a journalist. He wrote something dangerous, and he's just come back. Dangerous...? Politics... Seriously, someone like that just go fuck himself... I'm telling you, in a normal country he would've resigned the next day. When did anything go normally here? Well, yeah... Let's stop here. Good luck. Watch the news tomorrow. If you can get this jerk... to get the fuck out of here, this is on me. Really? Let's agree on 1500 forints. You did it? As you wished. What did you say? That a big shot analyst comes. Shut up! First you need to meet someone. What's this? Réka. You must go with them. I had to tell them... They 'convinced me. I want to be a journalist. You will be. Can I hold my class at least? Réka. Thank you. Endre. Are they really doing it? On the 23rd. Did the Boss approve of it? ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, THERE WERE 195 PERSONAL INJURIES DURING THE EVENTS OF 23 OCTOBER 2006. IN MANY CASES, CIVILIANS WERE ABUSED AFTER BEING ARRESTED AND SHOWING NO SIGNS OF RESISTANCE. PEOPLE WERE ABUSED BY POLICEMEN, ALTHOUGH LEGAL CONDITIONS FOR SUCH AN ACTION WERE NOT MET. ON OCTOBER 23, THE GUESTS OF A PUB WERE CHASED INTO THE STREET, ALTHOUGH NOTHING INDICATED THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN THE PROTEST. ON THE STREET, RIOT POLICEMEN PUNCHED AND KICKED THEM, AND SHOT RUBBER BULLETS AT THEM FROM A FEW METRES DISTANCE. AT LEAST ONE VICTIM SUFFERED LIFETIME INJURIES IN THE INCIDENT. SKI MASKED POLICEMEN DIDN'T WEAR IDS, ILLEGALLY. IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY LEGALIZED BY THE HEAD OF BUDAPEST PD, PÉTER GERGÉNYI. HE REFERRED TO THE POLICE DRESS CODE. ON 17 NOVEMBER 2006 HE WAS GIVEN MEDALS OF HONOUR FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE POLICE WORK THAT SECURED PUBLIC SAFETY IN BUDAPEST. IN SEPTEMBER 2011, HE WAS DEPRIVED OF THE MEDALS BY THE NEXT ASSEMBLY.
