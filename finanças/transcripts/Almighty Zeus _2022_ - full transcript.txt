Hate crimes against Asian Americans are on the rise. Every disease has ever came from China! Everything comes from China. You guys are disgusting! The China Virus At least 3,000 anti-Asian incidents since February Asia! Oh my God! Out of here! We don't want you here. That's why we elected President Trump! I'll kill you! I'll decapitate you! We did everything we could. I'm sorry. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family I always done my job to protect Rob, but this? This is something I never saw in a million years. Shit, Joe. It ain't your fault. It's those damn Chinese spreading this shit! Rob might get it next. Hell, any of us could be next. Rob ain't the same. I feel like he don't even wanna fight anymore. I've seen it in the gym. It's like he's got nothing to fight for. Well, let's give him something. What do you mean? What are we suppose to do? Just sit here and offer our condolences? His momma just died! I get that! God rest her soul, but we still got life in us. We're acting like we're next or somethin. I know there's still life in Rob but if we don't give him something to fight for, he's just gonna end up drunk, drugged up. What do you suggest we do? If it wasn't for COVID, his momma still be alive today. So I say he fights to avenge her. You saying we should have Rob fight in China? No I'm saying we have Rob's next opponent be Chinese and we beat his ass! And make an example of him. A super fight! Rodeo against the biggest Chinese boxer for the title. That way, Rob's got something to fight for. And we make a shit ton of money. The problem being. Ain't no Chinese people big in boxing. Nobody? Nobody anyone will pay to see. No Chinese? None. Then we'll just open it up. Chinese, Asian, whatever the fuck. If you can fight, you have a chance with the champ. We just gotta find someone that Rob can beat the shit out of. Fucking loser! Oh my God, Zeus! Look at your face! I'm alright mom. Huh? You're ugly now! Mom, I'm fine. God, please! Stop this boxing now. Mom, I'm not going to stop boxing, alright, I just won! Oh yea? How much? Not much. How much? Thirty-six dollars. Thirty-six? You risk your life for thirty-six dollars? Please! Stop this boxing now. And and just be a nurse! Mom, I don't wanna be a nurse. Fine, then just work at the post office. It's a stable job, Zeus. See, that's why I don't want to live here anymore. You always tell me to find a stable job. Like I'm trying to fight for my dream here. Oh, my God. You're going to give me heart attack. You want to give me a heart attack? Mom, calm down. Please! Stop this fighting. No! Then I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die, Zeus! Oh, that's what you want? Oh, okay you want me to die. Lord, God. Please strengthen me to be the next Boxing World Champion. Please allow my mom to be proud of me. And please Lord, allow me to never become a nurse When I'm all alone and far away. Floating further into outer space. I can count on you to remind me of my gravity and pull me back to earth I can count on you How you holdin up? I'm doing alright. I know you got a lot going on now. I just wanted to say Your momma, she meant the World to us. I appreciate that. Which is why I wanted to bring something up to you. What's that? See these Chinese they started this virus. And now we got thousands of people dying all over America. I mean, hadn't started with them, your momma would still be alive. This is the greatest country on the face of the earth. Are we going to let this virus keep Killing our people? Killing our moral? Our hope? I say we fight back. For your momma. For America. I say we put a Chinese boxer In the ring and you beat the shit out of him. Show him what happens when You fuck with America. Son, they took your momma. Well, let's take their fucking heads off in the ring. Zeus! Hey! What's going on? What's up, man? I heard you won your fight last night. Damn right I did. Ah, that's what I like to hear. I also heard Lorenzo quit. He was giving me bad advice. Ok. Ok, I understand. I also heard you were thrown out. They only gave me thirty-six dollars. And? So you hit him? You lucky you even got that. You gotta build your record up. You don't just get a shot at the World Title. You gotta build your way up there. You're not even paying attention to me right now! Who's that? That guy? Yeah. You don't wanna fuck with him. He only trains black fighters. Why's that? I just heard he's from the streets. And he only trains people from the streets. But forget about him. You follow my plan. You be making the big bucks. And then you can hire whoever you want. You always say that shit, man. I'm tired of being broke. You know how embarrassing it is to live at home with your mom? You're Asian! It's cool! You can stay at home until you're like forty. You think I want to live at home with my mom till I'm forty? Well, you can always be a nurse. Man, fuck you. What? I'm just saying, it's a noble job. Plus they pay well. And besides, you're Filipino. All nurses are Filipino. Man, the only time I want to see a nurse Is in the ring when I knock out my next opponent. And speaking of my next opponent, You got that set up for me yet? I'm working on it. Man, you always say that shit. Let me ask you. Have I ever failed you? Yes Well, have you ever lost a fight? No, but I control whether I win or lose. You control who goes in the ring with me. Do your job or I'm going to find somebody else. Don't talk to me like that. Look, I'll do my job. You just worry about knocking them out. I'm gonna get out of here. You did a good job last night. Almost forgot to put on this mask. You know this Corona virus shit. You don't know about it because you're Asian. Whoa, whoa what's that supposed to mean? You're immune to it. Why would I be immune to it? You're Asian. It started in Asia. I'm Filipino American, man. I was born here in LA. I know. But you know what I mean. You know that. No, I don't know what you mean, man! Man, stop being a fucking racist. I'm not racist. I'm just telling you the facts. The facts is you don't have to be Asian to have the Coronavirus. I'm just following the news. Just get out of here. You don't hear them talking about COVID. COVID. To be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China as opposed to calling it “The Chinese Virus”. And despite the fact that we, I have done a phenomenal job with it. Aye bro. What? Check it out. What the fuck? Fuck that! Yo get that shit! Hey old man! What's up old man? Get the fuck out of here! You know where you at? Looks like you need some hand sanitizer. Just get out of here, man! Spreading the fucking virus out here. You need some hand sanitizer, buddy? We don't like that shit. Nobody likes that shit. Hey! Get the fuck out of here. Why you messing with an old man for? What? You want some too? What he ever do to you? This! We greatly appreciate y'all being here. Now this is a tough time. For all of us. As difficult as a time it is, we would like to announce that this will be the last fight of Rob Rodeo Cooper's career. But, but with that said We would also like to announce, That Rob would be given an opportunity For a shot at the title to anyone Would like to apply. What do you mean by anyone? Rodeo understands how hard it is to become world Champion. How sometimes It's unfair that Up and coming fighters have to make their way up the ranks. So Rob would like to give this unique opportunity to the right person. All they have to do is apply on our website. And we will announce who the lucky opponent will be. Or, unlucky should we say. Why now in these tough times? Why so soon? Didn't your mother just pass? I believe that fighting is the thing I do best. Hell, It's the only thing I know how to do. But, with my mother gone. I feel like there's nothing left to fight for. But my team Coach Bundy, Luke Mahoney. The only family I have left. They brought to my attention what I must fight for now. And that is? Justice. And how will you do that? Find out on October 10th. Thank you very much. Wait, just one more question! Can you tell us who you're going to pick? Who gave you this idea? Oh, hi auntie Zeta. Morning, Zeus. Where's your mom? Oh, she's at the grocery store. Grocery store? She asked me to color her hair. Oh, sorry auntie You still boxing? Yes, auntie. Gorilla in Manilla. Zeus, you're not from Manilla. You're an Am-Boy. What's an Am-Boy? American Boy. No, I understand a little. Have you ever been to Manila? No, when I was young, yeah. You're an adult now. So start acting like one. Stop wasting your life in this boxing. You're too old, Zeus. Gorilla in Manilla. You're not even a gorilla. People say I fight like one, auntie. But are you a gorilla? No. You're getting older, your mom is getting older. Who's going to take care of her? A gorilla? I'll take care of her. Grow up, Zeus. Get a stable job, make good money! How much money are you making now? Not much. Not much? All this boxing, boxing and you're making nothing, nothing. Don't be a loser. Don't you pity your mom? She works two jobs just to support both of you. Two jobs, Zeus! You Am-Boys have no respect for us. You have no idea what we went through to get to this country. All you do is waste your life pursuing these dreams while we break our backs to support you. You are not a true Filipino. You did great Rob. Now we wait. I like how you sold that equal oppportunity bullshit. We got to. Otherwise they'll say we're racist. We want people to see this fight. At the end of the day, it ain't about being white or black or yellow It is all all about the green. Hey fellas. I think we found our guy. Oh, shit! You believe that shit? Oh, hell yeah. Anak, can you help me? There's more in the trunk. Zeus! Where you going? I'm going to the gym, uncle. Come here! Let me talk to you first. I want to know what's happening in your life. I'll only take a few minutes of your time. Come So What's going on in your life, anak? Nothing much, uncle. Just training for my next fight. You're still boxing? Yes, uncle. You're too old for that, Zeus. That's just a dream. I always tell him that. He doesn't listen to me. I still believe in this dream, uncle. Well, you need to wake up. You're not getting any younger. Pretty soon, another year will go by. And then five years and then you'll be old like me. You need to find a good stable job. A government job. Have you ever think about uh joining the Navy? Yes. It's a good paying job. With benefits. And you got to serve your country. You know I was in the Navy for twenty years. It's how I came to America. I got to see the world. Buy a house. And live a good life. I'll think about it. You say think about it but nothing happens. Write it down. Make a plan or something. Come on! You have to help your mom here. You're her only son. When she gets old, no one's going to take care of her I mean look at her She works just for you. And what do you give her in return? See? Nothing! Aren't you ashamed? I'll take care of her uncle. With what? When I win these fights… You have no money! When I win these fights I'll have enough money. There you go again. Dreaming. You're a dreamer, Zeus. If you join the Navy, at least you have money. And then you can do whatever you want. Right now, all you do is beg your mom for money. “Mommy, can I have twenty dollars?” “Mommy, can I have money for gas?” Your uncle is right, Zeus. I'm tired of working two jobs. Mom, just wait a little longer, okay I got another fight coming up And if I win… See! There it is! "If!" You see... Me and your mom grew up poor. There was never an “if”. If I didn't bring food home You know what would happen? My dad would beat me. If I didn't make any money, you know what would happen? My dad would lock me in the room and hit me with the belt. You Am-boys have it so good here in America Well I believe I'm gonna be the next Middleweight Champion of the world uncle. Do you think you're really going to be a big boxer on the TV? Huh? How many Asian boxers are there on TV? And who the hell are you? You're not even good! Only one in a million can get there. So tell me, Zeus Are you one in a million? Or just one in a dozen? Pray for your son that he wakes up. Stop this dreaming now. Next time I see you I don't want to hear about this boxing. It's time you help your mom. Time to be practical. Give up this dream! Look at your mom's face. That's the look of hard work just to support you. It's time you support her. Zeus! You get my next fight yet? No, no no I got you something better. Come on, man. Look! I got you something better. Oh, damn. Just saw it. Everybody is wondering who it was. I knew it was you when you threw that right. You're going to be fucking famous man. I know you're trying to be off the grid, but right now is the perfect time to get back on it. You're blowing up. So does this mean you'll get me my next fight? Yes! This means big bucks for you and for me. Alright then. I just wanted to show you in person. You really knocked the shit out of that guy. Oh, my God! All you had to do next was give him a blanket.

Sorry to interrupt. Uh, but how much money will my son get to fight this uh Rodeo? Well this would be a big fight so you'll be receiving about 1.2 Million dollars. Oh, my God! A Million dollars? Anak, Zeus, say yes! Rodeo would be getting ten. Obviously because of his record. But you will walk away with a million win or lose. Hold on mom let me get the details for a second. I don't care about the details. I don't want to work anymore. Where's the contract? I'll sign. Hold on. What's the catch? There's no catch. Win or lose. The money is yours. Alright, let's do it. –What the fuck just happened? –Hold on, calm down for –a second. –no, no, no. I look online –and your mom posted something about you being a millionaire? –I signed the deal. –Signed what? A 1.2 million dollar contract to fight Rob "Rodeo" Cooper Why didn't you call me? I thought I was your manager. Man, it happened so fast. What do you want me to say? No. And besides it's not like you're getting me deals anyways. You're always like, “Zeus, you gonna be famous!” “Zeus, you gonna get this and that!” Man, at the end of the day I just want to fight. And when you're at home living with your mom and all you hear is that you're a loser. And you won't amount to nothing. Man, something inside just said sign the damn thing. I get it. I understand. But I have to ask you as your manager, the one who always believed in you… –Aw, man here it is –I mean always believed in you I gotta know, are you gracious enough, generous enough, to give me ten percent? First of all, you never get me any fights. Second of all you always all talk and no delivery. At the end of the day, loyalty is more important than money. –Yup. –So I'm gonna give you some –money. –Yeah? Alright, alright, aye! Don't make me knock your ass out. Hey, hey, hey! Save that for the ring with Cooper. Alright. But let's be serious. What are you gonna do for a trainer? You're not going to like this answer. But I think I know the right guy. It better not be Coach Green. No. No, no, no, no, no. –He's crazy! –And that's why he's perfect. You're the one in the ring. Not me. As long as you sign the check for the ten percent, we're good. I'm out of here. Back so soon? I sent your ass the money. –I sent it back. –Now why would you do that for? –Because I want you to be my coach. –Your coach? Yeah. I don't have one. And I need one to beat Rob Rodeo Cooper. –Hear this nigga? No offense man. But I train real fighters. Mother fuckers that came from the streets. Not no social media viral one hit wonder mother fuckers. –I grew up in a tough area too, alright. I got into my first fight when I was eleven. What else you did in kindergarten? Man, if you don't want to train me, that's fine. I'll find someone else. Hold on. Hold on. Now, I'm not saying I'm gonna be your coach. But I'm gonna give your monkey ass a chance to show me the fuck you got. Alright. Now, get the fuck out my face before I change my mother fucking mind. Aye, put it back! Aye, put that shit back! Or I'll knock your ass out! Here, just take it! Keep it! Just don't mess with her anymore. Thank you. You didn't have to do that. No problem. That guy always does that. What do you mean? He doesn't take a lot, but I see everytime he does it. I'm sure he needs it more than I do. So you let him steal from you? I don't look at it as stealing. Well, I usually see you here working hard and singing and you can't let people like that rob from you. Well, what's worse? A robber or a stalker? Woah, woah, who's a stalker? Hold on, I'm trying to do a good thing here. Help you out. I'm not some creepy guy that just stares at you all day. Right. –I'm Cora. –Zeus. –That's a cool name. –lt's short for Corazon Corazon Punongbayan. –Oh, so you're Filipino? –My name always gives it away... It means, Tree... “Tree of the People”. Yeah, I'm Filipino too. –What's your last name? –Ortega. –Sounds more Mexican. –Aren't Filipino's the Mexican's of Asia. I think I heard Jo Koy say that once. Jo Koy's hilarious! Yeah, he put Filipino's on the map! Look, um I don't know if It's your lunch break right now, but I do know a good place around here that sells good halo halo. If you want to try it. I mean I did save you from being robbed so… I love how Villa Manilla makes the best halo halo. It's like finally, white folks would be able to enjoy our food. I know, right. For the longest time I was always embarrassed to eat any Filipino food in front of my white friends. Because they would always be like, “What's that smell?” I wish I can go to the Philippines someday just for the food. Yea –Have you ever been? –Yeah, when I was really young. But I haven't been there ever since. I always see photos on social of I always see photos on social of Boracay, Palawan, I'm like That's my hood! It makes me proud to see Filipinos being recognized for something. Yeah. It's either that or balut. Oh, that nasty egg fetus thing? –Wait! You don't like it? –Gross! You like that stuff? Yeah! How would you know unless you try? How about this, if I find a good balut place you gotta take me there? –lf you find a good one. I'm really picky when it comes to good balut. And the way you gotta eat it I see you got them good balut skills. So, are you training for a marathon or something? No, I'm training for a pretty big fight. Oh, you're a fighter? MMA or boxing? I box. Well, show me what you got. Oh, my God! I am so sorry! –lt's fine. –I thought you were fast! I am fast. I just you know didn't expect it. Um, but anyways uh, what do you do? Obviously, you didn't hear me singing back there. Oh, I have and you sing really well. –Right. –No really! You're just saying that. No, I know I'm toward the end of my run when I start to hear your voice. There's something unique about it where I don't hear the ocean or People. I just hear you singing. I moved here from San Francisco. To become a singer. But I never caught my lucky break. Been here for about five years now. No recording contract, no deal, no luck. Well you know I don't really believe in luck. I feel like we're all blessed with unique gifts. And it's up to us to use these gifts every single day. Some people never really realize their gifts. You know? And they just waste their lives trying to figure it out. But once you do. I feel like you gotta fight for it. Because life is a fight. Well... I better get going. Are you on social? Not really because I'm trying to stay focused for this fight. But how about you come over sometime? And we can try some balut? Sure. Leave your shit in the car and come with me. See this neighborhood out here? It's where I first got jumped by eight motherfuckers. I had to try and crawl out here alive. See that block right here? That's where I first got stabbed. I was just minding my business. Then all of a sudden it was blood everywhere. See that curve right there? I took that same guy, put his head on that curb and kicked his motherfucking teeth in No one ever fucked with me after that. –What up Coach Green? –What up young blood? How you doing? See you got some fresh meat in the house. Yeah, we about to put his ass on the grill, see what he's made of. Alright. Well, let's see what he can do. –Yo!

We got some fresh new meat in the house. –Yessir. Yea, You got no where to go now, kung flu. Now, you sure you want to learn how to fight? Yeah. Be careful what you ask for. This is where the real fighting is done. In the streets. Not in no damn boxing gym. These guys here, they do this for a living. It's not a sport to them. It's life and death. They fight every motherfucking fucking day. Some of these guys you may not even see them tomorrow. This is survival for them. Be warned. They're not going to be easy on you. I'm just here to make sure they don't kill your ass. Are you sure you want to learn how to fight? –Yeah, I just need some gloves. –This nigga said gloves. Gloves? There ain't no gloves in a street fight. Oh, and another thing. There ain't no clock either. You both go at it till one is left standing. –Huh? Lesson number one, always keep your hands up. Feels different to get hit with a bare punch, huh? Yeah, it's a pain you'll never forget. We exercising your muscle memory today. When I'm done, there won't be no muscle memory left. Lesson number two, remember they always fight dirty. So be prepared. Trash –Jones. –Yessir. You up next. Lesson number three never ever give up. You still want to learn how to fight? Yeah Wait till you meet the cholos from South Central. Zeus, anak is that you? –Yes, mom. –Oh, my God! –Look at your face! –Mom, I'm fine. –Ugly again! –Mom, I'm fine Oh, my God!

I think all Filipino guys are momma's boys. No, not all of them. I'm not a momma's boy. It means, it means you'll treat your future wife right. –Where's your dad? –Uh, he left when I was young. –I'm sorry to hear that. –No, no need to be. So, are you ready? For what? For my favorite part of the night? What's that? Eating balut! Yeah! I'm excited. Oh, no I can't. I can't. Come on, Zeus. Yes, you can! Ah, man. I can't. Here, that balut thing is all you.

Yo! Wake up. Training's over man. –What do you mean? –You don't got what it takes, man. I don't train losers in the gym. I train fighters and you're not a fighter. –What are you talking about? I fought all those people you were telling me to. Oh, you got your ass beat. That's what happened. I was listening to what you told me to. Listening and doing is two different things. You just like those other boxers out there. They watch a boxer on TV and they want to be on TV. But I put your ass in the street And you can't fight for shit. They see people on social media training and posting and talkin about they putting in work. But in reality they all fluff. No core. They all for show. They soft, just like all those other millennials. Well, I'm different and I fight different. How you different? What is different about you? Huh? Are you saying you're a Gorilla in Manilla? Cause you can't fight for shit. You're just all for show. And you're not even a real trainer. Taking people out into the streets. Teaching them how to fight. That's not how the greats did it. That's not how Ali did it. –ls you Ali, huh? Is you Fucking Ali? –I'm Zeus! Who the fuck is Zeus? Huh? Your mother should have named you Goose or Loose cause you can't fight for shit. Man, I'm out of here. Only true fighters train with me. Motherfuckers from the streets. I'm a true fighter. When you told me to fight those gangs, I was down. I'm even down to fight you right now in the ring. –You sure you want to do that? –Yeah. Ok. Let's get started. Ok. You ain't no Gorilla in Manilla. How the fuck you gonna take on Rodeo Cooper? You can't even hit an old man. What the fuck is the matter with you, boy? Look at you, you can't fight for shit. Get your monkey ass up. You could get hit a hundred times. But with a one-hitter-quitter, it's over Anak? Are you ok? Anak! What did I say? Stop getting hit. Look at your face. –Mom, it's boxing. –Stop getting boxed You box them. –I'm going to go to bed. –Oh, wait. Let me fix your face. I'll get my things. Anak You don't have to keep fighting If you don't want to. I want to mom, I have to. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to prove anything. –Yes, I do, mom. People say I'm a loser. You're not a loser. You cousin bong bong always in the Casino. He's a loser. –I just want to make you proud. I'm already proud of you, anak. But you always tell me to be a nurse or work at the post office. I just care about you. I want you to have enough money. Because without money, we can't move in this world. I grew up poor. With nothing. It was so hard. I don't want you to go through what I went through. And that's why I fight. I want to buy us a big house someday. And take care of us the way dad didn't. He left and now I'm the man of the house. You have, anak a million dollars, you're a millionaire. Not yet, mom. I still have to fight. I have to win. Uh, you don't have to win. You show up, let him beat you and come home. –I have to fight and I have to win. For all of us Filipino Americans. For minorities across the world. That don't have a voice. What will you accomplish? What will you promote? More violence? I'll promote that anything is possible in America. And that a man can be born from a poor woman in the Philippines and become a boxing World Champion. I'm proud of you, anak. Win or lose. You do what's in your heart. But remember Always pray to God. So he's with you in the ring. Always. Thanks, mom. Now, you get some rest so you're ready to fight again tomorrow. Hey! Yo! Hey! Wake the fuck up! Coach Green? How'd you get in my house? –Your momma let me in. –lt's so early I keep hearing knocking then this big guy scare me. He said he's your coach. I said, “Ok.” I didn't know you still live with your mom. Momma's boy. Get your monkey ass up. –Aren't all gangsters sleeping? It's like 3AM. –Gangsters sleep with one eye open. And so do fighters. –You say, what's all this gangster gangster? Are you gangster? No ma'am, I'm not a gangster. I'm a cold-blooded killer. And your son's about to be one too. You got one more stop. Long Beach. –Coach Green! –Uncle Yao! Ladies, fellas. Rule number four, What is it? No sex. What? No sex before a fight. No masturbation, no porn no nothing. That makes no sense. We need as much testosterone inside of you as possible. Got it? Got it. I'm serious! Got it. Let me take you to the warehouse. Now, this your kind. You better take all that shit that you learn and apply it now. Tom here he's been fighting his whole damn life. One of the baddest motherfuckers in the hood. A Muay Thai fighter. And today I'm allowing him to kick your ass. What? You can't kick in boxing. –Oh, yes the hell you can. This is a street fight, remember? Adapt or die, gorilla! Adapt or die. Footwork! Come on let me see some footwork. Hands up! Hands up! Remember why you started. Remember what you're fighting for. You want to know why gorillas pound their chest? Cause they ready for combat. And you ain't ready for no damn Combat. Let's go! Let's go! My man. You crazy, you know? Coach Green believe in you. He said you have heart. I say he crazy. I say you crazy. Perfect combination to win. You got heart, kid. You go down fighting and you keep getting your ass up. And that's what it takes to be a champion in my book. Let's get your ass up so we can get you ready for this fight. Two. Two. One. One. One. Three. Three. Three Find that spot. Start speeding it up. There you go! There you go! There you go! There you go! –Zeus! –What? Come here, man. Who designed the shirts? Me! Manila has one “L” not two. Fuck! Come on, man! You gotta let me design the shirts next time. Must have gotten this shit from the flea market. One. Two. Check this out, Zeus. You ain't doing this for you no more. You doing this for us now. You a gorilla now. Let's go, let's go! Come on, push it! Push it! Ladies and gentlemen, you can feel the electricity in the air. This is the fight we've all been talking about. Rob Rodeo Cooper versus some unknown fighter, named Zeus, “Gorilla in Manila” Ortega. They're making the announcement at the press conference now. After searching through thousands of potential opponents for Rob Rodeo Cooper, We are proud to announce that we have selected Zeus, “Gorilla in Manila” Ortega. To fight on October 10th, 2020. We spoke to so many potential strong fighters we felt that going with Zeus Ortega was the best option. I'm going to hand over the mic over to Rob. He's going to share his thoughts on the match. When I saw a video online of Zeus Punching an innocent American. And I just saw this man collapse I knew this type of behavior would have to be handled the right way. I stand today not as a boxer, But as a person fighting for justice. Today, I fight on behalf of the American people. On injustice and bullying. And I'm going to make an example. Out of Zeus Ortega on October 10th. Hold on, hold on. I got to interrupt. I got nothing but respect for you, Rob. And I greatly appreciate you giving me this opportunity. But let's set the record straight. That guy attacked me first. And I was just trying to defend an old man. Yeah, but you're a trained fighter. How about you pick on somebody your own size? Not some innocent bystander who was standing up for what he believed in. I know your kind. –See, this is the problem in America. People like you, misinterpreting The facts and spinning it around to make me look like the bad guy. After hearing what you just said I got no problem knocking your ass out on October 10th. What country are you fighting for? –Both of my parents are from the Philippines but I was born right here in L.A. and I'll be fighting for America. –You're not American. I'm American. American's don't fuck with weaker people just cause they can. American's don't take injustice. Why don't you fight for your own Country, wherever the fuck you came from. How confident are you in Zeus defeating Rob Rodeo Cooper. I'm very confident in Zeus will kick Rodeo Cooper's ass. In fact I got a proposition to make. If Zeus loses to Rodeo Cooper he'll leave this country. But if you lose, you leave America for good. Done. –What are you doing? –Relax. Mind games. He fuck with you, you fuck with him back. You losing the mind, You lose in the ring. Ok. It's settled then. Hey, coach! What the fuck was that about? –Mind games. –What if I lose? –Then you leaving America. –What the fuck? I don't want to leave America. Well, then win. What the fuck were you thinking? Why'd you say yes? What are you talking about? I'm gonna knock his ass out. –What if you lose? –I won't. –What if you do? –I won't. Everything ok? I don't know if I could take out Rodeo. And deep down inside I don't even know if I should fight. What do you mean? I see you out here and you play and people walk past you. With me, people think I'm some Asian racist that just beats up people. They look at me like I'm some loser. Well, maybe I am a loser. And maybe this whole Rodeo thing is just a payday. A loser? Stop talking like that. That's how I feel. And that's why you fight. You make sure the world knows you. It's why I'm out here everyday, every night, I don't care about the money. I don't care if people walk past me. I don't care if people steal from me. All I care about is that one person who feels my music. Who appreciates what I'm putting out in the world. I'm not like you Cora. I'm not making music. You're making history. You're fighting for us. For Filipinos. For Americans. I'm not American. People don't even know what I am. Is he Chinese? Is he Vietnamese? –And that's why you fight! You make sure they know who you are. I'm a nobody alright! Nobody gives a fuck about me. I'm a loser. A stupid fucking Asian loser! If that's what you believe, then you're right. Hands up! Come on! Hands up! Come on! Hands up! Come on! Hands up! Life's a fight and you're a fighter. So show me you're a fighter. Coach. What are you smiling for? You look like you had some. Oh, hell no. You did not. Please tell me you didn't sleep with her. Did you sleep with her? Zeus, did you? Yup! You dumb motherfucker. What the fuck did I say, when I said, no sex? Are you really trying to get knocked out in the ring? No We need as much testosterone inside you As possible, and here you go blowing up it inside her. If you get your ass knocked out I'm gonna say it's because of that pussy. Am I interrupting? –Nope. –Did you guys have sex? How was he? What? How was he in bed? Uh, aggressive? See, that's the shit we need in the ring. And here you go blowing up inside her. No offense, listen Miss Corazon Do me a favor please, for the love of God. Do not have sex Only after the fight. Got it? Dumb motherfucker. Finally the long-anticipated fight is here. Rob Rodeo Cooper will be going head-to-head with a local young Filipino American boxer named, Zeus “Gorilla in Manila” Ortega.

And so I contacted, the commission and I asked them if you could sing, the Philippine National Anthem. On fight night, and they said, Yes! This is so amazing! You're amazing. You deserve it. Wow, this is a blessing. What the fuck is this shit? Ladies and gentlemen, finally the fight we've all been waiting for. Rob “Rodeo” Cooper versus Zeus “Gorilla in Manila” Ortega. Yes, it's finally here and these times are truly crazy, Joe. I mean this is the first time, in history where the audience is all on TV. I mean there's really no audience in this arena and it's really weird. But one thing's for certain. Covid will not stop these two fighters tonight. –I know, Chuck, hey. COVID has taken a lot of things in this world, but one thing it hasn't taken over is the sport of boxing. Fighters will fight no matter what. Hey, it could be Armageddon and these two Still get in the ring with each other. Especially with the animosity Rodeo has towards Zeus. Now, check this Coach Green did say that if Zeus Loses this fight, that he'll Move out of the country. –Can you believe that? –Oh, my gosh. Oh, this fight's going to be truly interesting. I mean these times are crazy, but you know who's even crazier? Is Rodeo Cooper. I mean giving Ortega a chance at the Middleweight title of the world All while his mother just passed away not too long ago. I mean this fight means a lot to him. –Yeah, but Zeus is an underdog too now. He was born in America. Born in Los Angeles. That's my son. That's my son. And he went viral. Let's not forget he went viral. Yo! Remember when I knocked that chino out? Aye! There's my man. Let's go! Man, I knocked this guy out already. –Man, you stepped on his shoe. Yeah, alright. Nah, you did. We got a professional fighter and some kid who was viral on YouTube. Absolutely no shot. I mean it has to be a respect for the game. You can't just go viral after one hit and get an opportunity like this. –You know my brother knocked me out after one hit when I was eight years old. Should he be in this ring right now? –My momma knocked me out because I wouldn't clean the dishes. Could I step to my dad after that? Tell you what, your mom, my brother toe-to-toe right after this. How about that? –Let's do it. You know what, let's go. Might as well. –Oh, Zeus is so cute. –What'd you say? –What! He's cute. –I don't know. My money's on Cooper. Man, fuck you. Who's side are you on? I twenty thousand on Zeus. I knocked his ass out, he ain't that hard. That's because you used your legs. Try using your hands next time. I'll use my hands on him alright.
