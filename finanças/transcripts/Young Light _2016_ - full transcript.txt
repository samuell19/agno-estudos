Aah - Lippek? - What? Do you hear? Coal is coming! Yes! They're crazy. How shall I do my job? The Motzkat says to me: "Yes, you are right, Waller." "You know that ass." "He sits at the top of the drawing board and thinks the coal grows at a right angle." I say: "Fuck him, you are the pit foreman." "Make sure that the pit is being properly expanded." What are you saying? I said? "I'm not stupid." No, you're not, father. I fell. It's not bad. On shaft 3 they have the new coal plow. They are crazy. Instead of having two meters working height, at 70, 80 meters. What is happening? Then a whole coal layer falls down and buries H?bner. - H?bnerr? - H?bner. Who wanted to dance with me? Exactly him. The small fat one. And? What, and? We drag the man 1/2 kilometer up to the shaft, on a ladder. - On a ladder? - And now listen: The driver opens the elevator and asks me for weather book. Me! According to the weather book! Am I the weatherman? I say: "We have an injured man." "Do you want him to die?" I would like to have a... - How is he doing now? - Whom? The miner you brought out? H?bner. Some say so, others so. The leg becomes stiff. But he also has his good one. He does not have to work anymore. With accident and pension he has more money than before. - But the leg remains stiff. - So what? If they continues in shaft 3... with the coal plow. They won't make the expansion. Do you know what the hanging wall says to this? Says nothing for a long time. Very long time. And then a coffin lid comes down. What is a coffin lid? What is that? I can tell you. That is... That... that is... a stone. This is a grave stone. A huge... As big as our table? Nope! Much bigger, big as a house. And why do you say coffin? If a such one comes down, you are buried. Or, daddy? Julian, do not make your sister frightened! A coffin lid is not properly grown together with the mountain. It hangs so loosely. - Like a loose tooth? - Stop it now! Must not fall down, can also get stuck. And if so? Then the glasses rattle in the cabinet. Walter! Another one. We're done? In the corner. In the corner! Open your notebooks! What'is this? I could not write. I'm injured. But since when are you writing with your left? And? Can I leave? Hey you! What are you doing around here? Can you explain that to me? - I'm sick. - You look so. What else? - Tosca is gone. - Whom? Just ran away. - Who is Tosca? - He never did that. This is my dog. Can you hang this up? Maybe someone saw him. Of course. He's coming back. I hang him here.. Every information is on his badge. My name, where I live. She should have worked in a bar earlier. In Cologne.. As a singer. Why are you still standing around here? Get lost! There! Well? I'm just waiting. Nonsense. I wipe shortly once more over there. Go quietly upstairs. You're surely hungry. Come on. Ops. How is it at school, Juli? Well, so-and-so. But with this Maasdorp guy you don't go around the houses, or? Never. Thank God. And now go up up. Hello. Come here. Why aren't you school? Huh He hurt his finger! Yes, and? Why not? Blame yourself, no homework! Come here! - No, Mum! - But! Juli! Ouch! Ah! Juli! Stop it now! Mum, please don't! Liesel? I need a cup of flour. - Can you help me? - Yes, Trudchen. Come... Oh! Come in! Hey Well? Wait a moment. I don't know. So bad? Last Sunday she wanted to go to the church in a short skirt. Really? Of course Konrad forbid it. He said: " She mustn't be surprised, if someone drags her into the bushes. Here. I know how much you wanted one. - For me? - Do I talk with the mailbox? Nevertheless, you are a peeper. Just like me. Taking photos? This is like drawing, only with light. When you visit has. Then tell us, will you? I'll lend it to you over the holidays. - Do you know how to use it? - Yes. It's so fast! Couple of compliments, a little of liqueur. And then I'm grandma and the asshole is gone. Time, aperture and distance. I'll develop the film for you. But I want to see some good photos. I photographed the deer in the animal park. Puff. Deer. Isn't that boring? Take pictures of your buddies instead. I'll do that. Nevertheless, you are travelling to Baggersee. Will be pleasing to look at later. You find that funny? Yes, I find that funny. You'll soon be grandma! Quiet! Quiet! Have you heard? Nope. WALLER. Ah, let's go. - Have you already had breakfast? - Nope. Take off your pants. I want to wash them. - You stay with your sister today. - What? - It's holidays! - Exactly. Then you can do something for me. I have to go for an analysis. And I have to go for a spot of work And who makes us dinner? You! Get a package of Miracoli for you and Sophie. That is not enough. With the bottle deposit it's enough. Watch that Sofie doesn't go to the oven. During the holidays I can get some chicken. - You promised. - But not on the 23rd. You're good. Next month maybe. Boah! Well, don't one say "good morning"? Morning. I slept badly! The heat makes you mad, doesn't it? As in an incubator. - Leave the window open. - Hence you come with me? Why? Why should I come with you! Are you going on holiday? No Why not? You're not going neither Because we pay for the house, little one. Maybe she must go to the hospital. That's why we stay. - Are you getting a little brother? - Nonsense. -She did it with the bile. -What is this? You shall take your pants off! I want to start the washing machine. I only have this one. The others are short. - Are you going out? - Would be nice. I must go to the city. Oh, by the way My son will become an adult. Then act like that. Big men do not creep around in the grass. At least not with pants. Down with it! Yes, soon. No, at once! I have to go. Are you deaf? Take off your pants! Nevertheless, I'm going. Why? Where to? The washing machine stands here. You are all driving me mad. Come! Come on. Hurry up. I'm afraid. I want to go home. You wanted to see Papa! What is it? Come. Yes. I will also see! Ha ha, they're all naked! They're all naked! Now come on! Clear off! - Sorry! - I don't care - I... - Can you read? Read the place here. Very loud. "The fathers have eaten sour grapes." "But the children's teeth became sore from it." Na prima, sounds good. You're the lector. "Everyone who sins shall die." - Yes, yes. Get dressed now. Pay attention while turning the pages! The gold edge sticks. So, now set it up. And off, slowly. Oh, thank you, sweetie. You have a beautiful voice. The father eats sour grapes. Children's teeth became sore. Wonderful! Like a real professional. - Thank you, Mrs. Morian. - Will you visit me? I could use some help. But you want to become priest! I? No, not at all! "The children's teeth became sore!" The children! Sore! As if I've not got enough on my mind. I was at Marian yesterday. Do you have too much money? Nope, too much ink in the pen. And how much? How much what? Ink in the pen! Nope. How much did you have to pay? Nothing. I left my watch there. Kienzle? It is broken. Yes, I said so. Have you won in Lotto? You should buy Stuyvesant, idiot. I couldn't. Should be for my parents. Do you understand? Hey, idiot? What is that for a hot thing? Take a picture of us! Come over, boys. Come on,quick! Get going, idiot! And careful, don't be shaking! - It's in the film roll. - Else, wanker! Each of us three gets a copy. I am so horny, I could eat a panty. Am I a member now? Let you eggs grow first! Then I'll think about it. And bring us photos of Marusha! Shit, not to jack off to. Understand? - Do you understand? - Yes. What are you doing here? And how do you look? Now Waller, getting escort? - Bye. - Bye. What is there to eat? - I think spinach. - And? Fried potatoes and fried egg. Are you a girl? Hold firmly on to the saddle. Mum? Mum, we're back! Mum? What's it? Mum's gone. As in away? Can't be. Liesel? Mum? Daddy, she's here. Do you have a colic again? Shall we call an ambulance? No. Just let me lie here. Do you want a hot water bottle? Now listen. If you are sick, then please visit the doctor. And if it's something with the bile, then please let them fix it. What else are hospitals for? I'm sorry for all of this. When I'm coming home from work, I want something to eat! Do you understand? Then set the darn dinner on the table! If you can smoke so much, then you can also cook for your family! Kindly get up! What is it now? Bile? No. The doctor says it's something psychological. What psychological? What does it mean? I don't know. Has something to do with emotions. Or with the nerves. My brother became divorced because of "mental incompatibility". What that means, he can't tell me to this day. But I have a guess. Watch out: My brother has a much too long dick. A real hanger. And after every number his wife asked him: "Tell me, Rudi, have we fucked or have you hit to me in the arse? In the long run my brother... mentally kinked. The doctor ordered her a lot of rest. Now she wants to take the little one to her mother by the sea - And the boy? - Stays with me. Tomorrow, Jupp drives her to the train station. Brother-in-law? With the Opel Captain? What else? Hey, what are you looking at? So what? Nowhere! - You looked under my dress. - Not at all. Good trip, Mrs. Collien. - Thank you, I will. Get well, okay? Sophie should not swim too far. - Yes I know. - And don't leave them on the paddock. - The horses have got their foals. - Yes, yes. Noodle salad in the fridge. Use the vacuum cleaner from time to time. Do not be too wild when they're gone. Bring her safely to the station. Don't forget the plants! Hey, you peeping Tom! Are you not ashamed? Why? I drank a glass of milk. - You photographed my tits. - Not at all! - Just from behind. - So you looked in. When you leave the window open, where am I supposed to look? Are your father there? No, at work. But I'll get you one of his cigarettes. Leave it. Too strong for me. Have your mother already written? Nope, she's just left. What's wrong with her? What does she have? What she has? Bile! Sure. I mean why she always beats you! Doesn't happen so often. I can hear it. Almost every week. She hits you with the wooden spoon till it's broken. Not on Sophie. - Don't you get spanked? - Nope. - Your fatheralso hits you. - Which father? I don't have one. Gorny. Because of the short skirt for the church. That's my affair! I become 16. If he does this once more, I'll tell Jonny. Or I'll leave. Really? You would do that? - And then? - Well, nothing. If you choose freedom, nothing can happen to you. Never! Look, this becomes a scar. This is not a scar, little one. This is a scratch. Will become one. Do you like that? So-so. This is our kitchen! Do I get to know your girlfriend now? You have a storm-free hangout. I don't have a girlfriend. I'm 12. You're almost 13. Whom do you like in your class? Do I know her? We're just guys. So what? Never kissed a girl? Nope. Then you must learn it, or? Kissing is important. Most guys can not. They always want more at once. Ask Jenny. To boys don't care whether a woman is ugly or have a bad breath. Do you know what he says? "Put a towel over her." Why? That's stupid. With the towel he doesn't see them anymore. I'll bring your belongings from the hotel. You can wait the car. There are people who always remain a mystery to us. Even though we may love them. Are you stupid? You don't cheat me, or? Jonny and I just want to discuss something. Are you kissing him? Don't be cheeky, little one! Go to sleep! Who's there? Who is it? Can we pee here? We talked and drank too much beer. - Why don't you use your pot? - It's full. Please, Juli. You'll get something for it. - Straight ahead. - He knows that. Has he strangled you? What's this, you asshole? Are you stupid? Why? Is a small brand mark. So everyone can see that it's from Jonny. Yes? How shall I explain this at the job? - You mean, What they think? - Shut up. Take a pee. Your own fault, or? How old are you, little one? Almost 13. So 12. Do you already have pubic hair on your balls? Don't be offended. You're not a girl. Do you want to ride my Kreidler? Would you let me do that? You are driving my Kreidler tomorrow. I've never driven a moped. Never say moped to my Kreidler! You mustn't call me mister, either. You're the Julian and I'm the Jonny. Clear? Sure.. But... - A Kreidler is a moped? - It doesn't matter. - Thank you, Juli. - And don't make a fuss! Tomorrow the spot from today is from yesterday. Go to bed now, okay? I'm also going to sleep now. We will see if she goes to sleep. Julian, now please close the window! Julian? What is it? Why do you close the door? Actually, I don'tt want to. It ran like a creepy movie. You are crazy. A movie is a movie and you are you. Who should do you something? - No one. - So what. Shut the TV, man! The door will not be closed, right? I want an answer! Yes. What are you doing with the dog? Want to become a member? Hold the dirty whore's dog firmly! Living torch. Do you understand? Hey! Where are you taking him now? And now go away! Go away! I baptize you "Fackel". What was that noise? Sorry. I didn't want to wake you. I wanted to make you bread and tea for work. What does it smell it here? Have you lighten a fire? I? No, no. The fat one, Olaf, he... I was allowed to help repair the Z?ndapp. Uh, that was broken. Come over! Come out! What are you doing in my shed? I photographed the dog. Did I say you should take pictures of dogs? Where did you get him from? This is a hunting dog. Pure breed. He obeys me. You can't lock him up in the shed. That's animal cruelty. He needs exercise. Could have asked me. My shed is also your hiding place. We had something like that before. If our parents knew what we were doing... What are you doing? We are playing cards. Autoquartett or Mau-Mau. And mostly I'm drawing here. Tell me what things are you doing here? What things? Do you think I'm stupid or what? No. Don't be embarrassed. It's normal. We also did it. What do you mean, Mr. Gorny? What you think. Now listen. When father is on night shift, are not you bored? You're all alone. I mean, I'm also sleeping badly. I could come by and visit you. We play something together. Your Autoquartet or something. About the dog, it remains between us. Yes? Julian? Say a phrase from Bochum, Cologne and saxophone. "He turned around the corner to pee. You could see his balls from the side." Gorny has recently asked me what I want to become. I said, miner, like you. And he said, "So, what did I tell you!" How do you know? What else can he say? Typically Gorny. I don't want to become a miner, either. I'm going to be a coker at the coal plant. What? Working on coal plant? Why? I like the fire and the white steam. You're still free. Can be a miner or steel worker Or coker. In the steel mill is it most fire. The steel mill makes the sky red. The white steam comes from the coal plant when the coal is extinguished. Exactly every ten minutes. Yes. The ovens must never extinguish. Not even in Christmas? A coke-oven always works. Christmas and New Years Eve. Easter and Pentecost. Simply always. Day and night. And you will work there? Not in a mine? Under ground it's always night. Can also be nice. Once all forests were down there. 145 different, overlapping forests lie below us. How do you know that? Local history. So what do you learn at school? Phew! Hell I'll be coker. And what do you do as a coker? What everyone else do. Burn and erase coal. Moment. If you mean, I get coal from the earth, so you coker can burn it? Not? Coal is extracted. What? Why? Because it's like that. Everything that was in these woods, comes back when cooking. The black gold. Good, mother hasn't had laundry outside. Tell me, Gorny is a miner like you, isn't he? Why does he have a house and we not? The house belongs to the bank, not to Gorny. That's out of the question for me. I want to be free. So do I. Make me two slices of breads. Aaaaah! Don't be scared! I just want to know where your repair kit is. Shut your mouth, milk-teeth become sour. Where is your repair kit? Inside the shelf. And what are you doing here? Getting coal. I see. And why don't you do it? Forgot. You can forget the football team Rot-Wei?-Essen. Ha, ha, ha. A boy your age squat at work! That's for girls. Work with thrust, not with pressure. Bend down. No, not so. Watch out. With force, come on! And! And! You see it works? Already taken photos? - Yes, little Schulz. - Do you two come along? Okay. He never cheats when playing cards. Like me. Little Schulz is a sweet brat. He will surely become gay. You're bored, eh? Nope, it's ok. But, you're bored. Watch out. We can do something. We visit Lippek. He is quite a fine fellow. And his brother is a real criminal. Really? He robbed seven millions. Do you remember the diamond robbery two years ago? Yes. That was Lippek's brother. We'll go there? You clear the table. I'll shave. Then we'll go. These Sundays are deadly boring, right? You're waiting all week until you're off work, and then you don't know what to do. I think I'll emigrate. Maybe to Holland. There are those bums. They don' t work and still live well. Do something with Jenny. With who? That ass doesn't need me to come any more! We're making a trip. To Lippek. He's a real diamond robber. - Was even in the newspaper. - Really? Anyway, he was there. He or his brother. Come along and ask him. Do you think so? Hello, Mr Collien. - You're making a trip? - Nonsense. We're going for a walk. Can I come with you? - You are not even properly dressed. - I need a minute. - Maybe next time. - 30 seconds. Please, Mr Colllien. Juli said I could come with you. OK, I don't mind. But we're only going to Kleekamp. And tell your parents. You start early. Get dressed and comb your hair. Chop chop! Can I go like this? Like that I'm not taking you with me. Take on something else. Why? It's almost 3O degrees. You know what I mean. Alas. Does one see that? I'll be right back. In which building do you work? In none. I work beneath the earth. Oh God, all day? Now all night.Why? How can you work there? That's unhealthy, isn't it? The dust, the bad air, dirt under the fingernails. And always something happens. On the construction, you can fall from the scaffold. And in the steelworks... What do I know... What's important, is that you feed the family. Aaaah! -What is it? -I stepped on a thistle. Youngster, youngster. Stepped in a thistle... Come! Sit down there. Waller, old horse! Wait, I'm coming. If you had told me, I would have shaved. - This is my eldest. - I know. And she's your daughter? - Gorny's daughter. - Sure? - Sure. - She's a real jewel. - Do you have a beard? - That's the hormones! Admit it! You stubble with the vacuum cleaner all day long. Do I look like that? Enter. I'll get something to drink. Don't run away! Sit down! Nope, you get the malt beer. Sunday is still something else. Ladies First. It goes down like a song. What's the matter? Pregnant? She doesn't get anything. Nothing strong. - She is only 15. - Seriously? I'm going crazy. Good you said that. One want to know, why you go to jail, right? I thought she was ready for marriage. - But one can that, Waller! - Only one, Mr Collien. - I'll be 16 soon. - You see, she'll soon be 16. So ladies and gentlemen, to your father! No one works like him. And he's a real buddy. What I became in the old pits, is only due to Waller. Waller-banger! Bottom up! Mmm. It's not as sweet as I thought. Really tasty. Is it true that you are a diamond robber? You watch out! Before you say one more word: We're here in my apartment! Or where are we? In my apartment one behaves politely. - For you, I'm you, right? - Sure. Stop it! Nope Waller, this is my territory. Bottom up! So now what? Did you steal diamonds? Unbelievable, isn't it? Would you have thought she's 15? - A real woman. Fully skilled. - No, I'm still in the apprenticeship. Nevertheless, you are fully educated. She's really in the apprenticeship. Smart ass! I'm a textile seller at H?velmann & Schmitz. Oh, shit! Honest? I once bought under pants there. But that was embarrassing. Some matron asks me: "What Is your increment?" In front of people. And I said: "No idea, I haven't yet measured." "Maybe a meter." Everyone looks at me as if I had a big one. That was surely G?bel. She asks such questions. - Was G?bel. - What do I know, the name of the bitch. Now I'm only buying from the bargain table. Come, Heine you're falling behind. In one go! Stop it, Herbert! Gorny throws us out when she comes home drunk. - Gorny has nothing to tell me! - Gorny? I've also boozed with him. Do you accept as little as your father? He's not my father! Cheers, Waller! And, did you steal diamonds? With weapons and everything? It wasn't him, but his brother. I told him. It was also in the newspaper. Can you tell. All idiots. Stupid like skipper's shit. Guess someone is in jail now. Diamonds have no value. Remember that. Diamonds are also just coal. Smart ass! It is true! - Do you have any music? - Old Vinyl discs. Sure. The whole music box is full. Oh, God. Don't you have anything more modern? Lords, or Searchers? Am I Pillek? - Negro music does not come into my house. - Right, Waller? - Nope! I got something for you. On your knees. Go down to your knees. Just kneel down. And now you're doing so with your chin to the edge. Exatly. Wait. Ha ha, war! You have certainly shot many, Mr. Collien. Him? Not a single one! He was chauffeur. If you want to know one who has fought in the war, then sit here. Now listen, he is interested in girls, right? He draws well. Especially animals. He always draws animals. He's a country bumpkin. Once... - ... maybe it was two... - Papa! What is it? Will he become uncomfortable now? Not seriously, Waller! The boy is right. I have to sleep. Then we'll have another drink. Come here. Fruits are healthy. Herbert. Bottom up! ? Gl?ck auf, Gl?ck auf! Caution head! the pit foreman comes, and he has his bright light in the night,? Ui! ? Gl?ck auf, Gl?ck auf! Gl?ck auf, Gl?ck auf! Steiger kommt, and he has his bright light in the night, and he has his bright light in the night, already lighted.? Lippek: Gl?ck auf! ? The miners are most honest people, because we wear the leather before the ass at night since they carry the leather on their ass in the night, and booze spirits. and booze spirits.? Do you like Lippek? Nope! He drinks too much and is too short for me. Too short? I want someone to lean on. If he were like your father, then... What are you talking about? Herbert is the same size as me. But you look bigger. Because you're more quiet. Such rubbish. Drop it! Shoes. Julian. Until then, you two. Was a nice trip. I will return. Brush your teeth, do you hear? Otherwise, Gorny thinks, I made you gotten drunk. You also did. Fackel! Fackel, come! Fackel! Fackel? Fackel! Well, sissy? Do you think Morian let's you in? What are you doing here? Fuck! Do you want to look, incense swinger? Have you gotten dickspit yet? I'm looking for the dog. - He has no mud on the pipe. - Shut up! Come, we're looking for your dog. And they? They'll keep watching. Come on now! Hey buckle, where are you? Come and fuck! Come! Come here, Juli! She's waiting for you. Oh, God! Is she sick? Don't make a fuss! Never seen a dead one? She was always sick. But always very drunk. For a bottle of Martini you got everything from her. I believe you're the only one she hasn't served. Man, damn shit! Scrapes off easily, stupid cow! Whom must we call? Police... and a priest? Whom does one call then? The fire department? Come here, altar boy! You don't get this every days! No please don't! There is corpse poison! Not so horribly, or? The first tit in your life. Shall we pimp her? That is still good. Are you crazy? How so? She doesn't notice anything! I'll show you how to do it. Is quite easy. I'll take it all back! She's not good anymore. Juli? Juli? Juli? Juli? - Dad? - What? Oh, nothing. Well, say it! There's no body poison, is it? Can't one die from it? What's with you? Drop it. - When are you coming back? - Soon. I have only a short maintenance. Go to sleep. I have to go. Dad? Dad? See, I'm going. Why does the boy always close the door? Ha ha ha Good night. Wash yourself. Good, Konrad. Then everything is discussed. - And now get out of here! - You mustn't be insulting. I can also be different. One call. Three numbers. Do as you want. Can't stop you from that. But now get out of here! In the end of the month you are out! - Where shall we go, Konrad? - That's not my problem. Get lost! I won't say it again! What did he mean by "out"? I got to go. Make me some slices of bread. Now! What's on it? Nothing. Fridge is empty. If you give me money, I'll get you sausage. Stray salt on it. Done. Why are going so early for the shift. What happened? No. Don't worry. Must only settle something. And then to the miners' guild. What did Gorny want? Do we really have to move out? Well. Seems so. Why then? Because of the dog? Because of me? What? Why because of you? Not because of you. Why then? Well... You don't understand that yet. Who would he call? The police? Why the police? Don't know. Hasn't even a phone, right? He does it with smoke signals. Like the Indians. Don't worry. It'll be fine. I call mum. You've grown again. Juli, you know what? I can ride without a saddle. I had a pony with spots. That was Murmel. And I had a friend. He always gave me half of his raisin bread. And sometimes even more. And do you know what his name was? - Get going, upstairs! - Very funny. Ole! Have you ever heard that? Grandma always made me potato pancakes. And you? What did you eat? Chicken. Every day barbeque chicken with French fries. A small truck will be enough for the few things. It's a no-brainer. I'm coming Saturday morning. Then you can have breakfast in the new apartment on Sunday. Really nice. Central heating. You will like that. Girl, stop crying! Shall I tell you something? No, thanks. But I do. We're moving! Into a new apartment. Aha. Who says that? That's what mum said to Jupp. In the car. Because we are minors. She said, if one is a minor and makes nonsense, then you fly out of the apartment. Did you make nonsense, Juli? Me neither. What is actually underage? When you are young. We both are underage. And Marusha, too? She.too. Men are idiots! Is that why you're crazy? Is it worth it? Yeah what's up? Nothing. I've been thinking if the curtains fit. The curtains. Was custom made. What doesn't fit, will be made fitting. So girls, till then. Julian, Sophie? Come. Say goodbye uncle Jupp. The plant gets no light in the corridor. They have to be placed somewhere else. There is no place... for the plant. That looks stupid. It needs light and sun. Juli? Help me with the table! Seize! It must be clean. Nah, come around! You're scratching the door frame! That is not straight! Can't you see when it's straight? I don't like soup for breakfast! It will be eaten! Otherwise, it will become bad. Look out for bone splinters. Grandma is not a butcher. She chops the animals like wood. Juli, what happened when I was away? Hm? Who was in my apartment? Don't know. And what is that? Don't know. What have I swept up there? These are hair. Of course it's hair! But from whom? - They wanted to burn him! - Burn? I've cleaned the whole apartment! Even the tub. Twice with ATA! I can't trust you! The apartment is neglected! The plants dry out! You bring animals in and poison the apartment with hair! Why am I sick, huh? I'm going now. Will you take your rubbish with you? Moment! Juli? How do you look? I? How so? Here, I want to return it. Going on a trip? Nope! Well, then. What is wrong with you? Don't you have a home? You have no church service, or? No. But I would like to confess. Confess? Confessions are on Saturday, boy! But I will confess now. Hm? How come? I have to. I'm so curious about what is so sinful now. In remorse and humility I confess my sins. I was disobedient, stole and lied And I was impure. Amen. What did you steal? Well Not really stolen.. I had them write it on the account of my parents. Aha. Chocolate, gum, Filthy magazines? - Beer and cigarettes. - Beer and cigarettes? What did you do with it? Gave it away. I wanted to be a member of the gang. They said... Yes, yes, yes, all right. So. How was that with impure? Come on, how were you impure? Alone or with others? Both. And when you were impure with others, who started? - Not me! - Was it a girl or a boy? Rather a girl. What did you do? I don't know. So you don't know? Did she touch you? She stroked my hand. From inside. And we kissed. That is, I wanted to kiss her. With the tongue! Mm. That was all? I touched her breast. Whose breast? I can't tell. Yes. Julian, you wouldn't need to confess today Julian. You had time until Saturday. You're now in an age that such temptations increase.. Not everything is equal to sin. Important is, that you don't forget God. How to pray the Lord's prayer? "Lead us not into temptation." But the original version of the prayer is different. Namely: "And lead us in temptation." Do you see the difference? Mr. St?rwald? I hear, boy. I hear. Now that I have confessed my sins, can I also confess for another? You will what? For whom? I can't say. Listen. To make it short: No one can confess for another. But he never goes to church. Do you know his sins? Yes. And what are they? Well... Actually, he is a good person. He never beats me and he gives me money for soda and so on. But he was also impure. Where did you get that from? Have you been there? I? For God's sake! Repentance belongs to the confessions, otherwise it would be pointless. You cann't regret the sins of another. Why not? That's logical! If your sister broke her friend's doll, you can't be sorry for her. No? Of course I can that. Very definitive no! You can pray for the person that God forgives him, etc. But you can't repent for his sins. And I can't give him absolution. Was there anything else? Julian, don't dream! Yes... well no. There's not cadaveric poison, or? Stop it! You can't stop the whole service here! So: Ego te absolve. Two our Father and one Ave Maria. And goodbye! Thanks be to God. Mum! Look what I found! Julian in the snow. With short pants! When did he you that? Nonsense. Don't you see it's old? In 1936. Your father was 12. But he looks like Juli, right? The hair. And the eyes. Exactly! But why does he wear short pants? It's winter. Just so. Wears long socks. What are you doing here? I have run away. With backpack, supplies and everything? Where do you want to go? Don't know. Scram is no way. Would be nice, but I can't. What happened here? Something has broken. The morning shift was already outside and the afternoon shift isn't yet in there. The next workingshift was going to start, but then, the mine collapsed - A big stone which suddenly collapsed? - Maybe. Come, let's go home. Subtitles by Jean
