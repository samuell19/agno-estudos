Woohoo! Woo! Uh-oh. All lined up! Go time! I made it! Oof! Oh! It has been described by scientists as an insect paradise with thousands of species of insect calling it home. In fact, it has the highest concentration of insects - Wow. - in the entire world. The insects are drawn to this oasis due to its warm weather and abundance of plant and flower life. Golden Canyon is truly a sight to behold. It is considered one of the Eight Wonders... Wow. It's like a fantasy land! If you do decide to visit, don't forget to bring bug spray. Huh? Hey... Wha... Who are you? Whoa... The target is somewhere in this building, sir. That slippery scum's done for! Holy moly! You're like, all the way out there! Sir, no sign of the target. Hey, you. Googly Eyes. You seen a green dragonfly come through here? We need to have a talk with him. Uh... a green dragonfly, you say? Yeah. I did see one... Oh, where did he go? Oh, yeah, I remember. He went thataway! Is that so? Better be true. If you're lying, you're gonna meet the business end of my backside. Oh! Let's buzz out! Yes, sir! That was a close call. Thanks, mounted insect pose. You too, Googly Eyes. Wowzer! Would you look at that? So cute, tiny homes! Fiddler crab? Scary. Roaring tiger worm? Aww... Ah! Huh... Knockity-knock. Anybody home? Huh? "Invisible slug." And they were able to catch you? Should've just turned invisible, geez. So, Googly Eyes is a sweet little ladybug, huh? Did I scare ya? Oh, dear! Hey! That is not a nice thing to do to your elders. Sorry. So what do those guys want from you? The ones that flew around like this. Oh, those guys? They're just jealous of my kung fu skills. Lucky I didn't feel like fighting or I would've kicked their heinies. Master Dan never loses a fight. Who's that? That's me. I'm, like, a super big deal. Surely you've heard of me. I'm not Shirley. Don't know a Shirley. My name's Ruby! Whatever. Seriously? You never heard of me? Huh? I'm the one and only Master Dan. We dragonflies are the greatest of all flying insects. We hold the record for the furthest distance traveled. And I am the greatest of them all! Really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Definitely the greatest. Of all dragonflies. Yep, for sure-sies. Wow. That's way cool! But if you're the greatest, why did you have to hide from those guys? Well, I told you. I didn't feel like it. Moving on. I'm a brilliant globetrotter. Been everywhere. Well, have you ever been to the Golden Canyon? Duh. Of course! It was amazing! Maybe the prettiest place I've ever been in my entire life. You wouldn't believe how many ladybugs were there. They're all over the place. Seriously? I have to go there! You and everyone else. Ah, those trees and flowers... I can still smell them! And springs with the crispest water. It truly is an insect paradise! Hey! Let's go now! Uh, well... about that, uh... Yeah, I can't do it. I'd really love to but, you see... I'm supes busy right now. Huh? Wait, I'm coming with you! I don't think that's safe. Wow. Well done. Googly Eyes got some skills. - -Danger! Danger! Bye-bye! Whoa! Red alert! Open cage! Huh? That was close! Ah... Poor little Googly Eyes! Sure showed a lot of gumption. Wait up! I'm coming, Master Dan! I thought you were a goner. Oh... What's that? Wow. Wow... Huh. We're free! Wow, I did it. I finally made it out! Golden Canyon, I'm coming! Master Dan! Googly Eyes! Hold tight! I'm coming for you! Help me! Help me! Please, help me! Hey there! Woo! Huh? Chill out. What you worried about? Yippee! Tubular! Wow. Gnarly! Wahoo! Huh? Whoa! Wah! Righteous! I'm catching some sick speed! Woohoo! Radical! Googly Eyes! What are you doing? Flap those wings! Flap 'em hard! Why do I have to be such a nice guy? Master Dan's coming to the rescue! Stop playing around in there, Master Dan! You have to concentrate on the driving! You're not helping! Drive better! No, that's worse! Party, party! Party, party! Please wake up. I don't want to accidentally pull off your legs. Ah! Hmm... Ah! Master Dan! What's going on? Where am I? What happened? Hi. Hey, there. You nearly got me splattered! That's it! We're done! You're on your own! I'm done being a nice guy! How will I get to Golden Canyon? You're the only one that knows how to get there. You're still talking about Golden Canyon? Well, guess what, Googly Eyes? I was lying! I've never been! I just wanted to sound cool, okay? That's okay. You're still my friend. Let's go together! We're not friends, capiche? Stop following me, right now! Stop it! I get cranky when I'm hungry too. Get out of here! I don't want you anywhere near me! Master Dan is a solo act! Gimme that! Thanks. See ya. Master Dan... I don't know what to do. I don't know how to get to Golden Canyon. I don't even know if it's real. Golden Canyon is real. It has to be. I will find you, Golden Canyon! Yeah! Alrighty. If I were Golden Canyon, where would I be? - Party, party! - Huh? Party, party... Excuse me. Hi. Huh? You guys happen to know where Golden Canyon is? Party, party... Hey, wait a second! Where'd they run off to? Ladies and gentlebugs, get ready to get down! Let's eat, drink, and buggy! Huh?

Hey, sir. Check it out, it's Googly Eyes! The kid from earlier! Googly Eyes? Yeah, the one who lied to us about Master Dan. She's mine! Not so fast, Googly Eyes! Where do you think you're going? So, we meet again, Googly Eyes! Thought you were real slick, didn't ya? You better start talking, kid. Right now! Where is that scummy, no-good dragonfly? Huh? Ah! I'm not telling you anything! You big, ugly bully! Hey! Name calling hurts feelings! Show 'em what we do to name callers, sir. I'd be scared, too! That's not cool. I didn't do anything! - Huh? - Eh? What are you pea-brains waiting for? - Stop that bug! - Yes, sir! Get 'em, boys! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Freeze, kid! Huh? I'm really not in the mood for this today! I'm going to get you, Googly Eyes. It's just a matter of time. Little wings getting tired? Come on! Ah-ha! Please help me, Googly Eyes! I'm begging you! Don't leave me this way! Better not mess with me! I'm the great Master Dan. Master Dan! I'm so happy to see you. And by the way, those guys are still looking for you. Huh? Well, of course they are. They're jealous of my awesomeness. Always somebody trying to steal my... ...thunder. What the heck... Hold on! Help me! Don't worry, I'll save you! Help me! So that's over there. Big giant hungry frog. So, sir... You wanna go first? Don't be dense. Our job is done here. - Let's go. - Yeah. Are you okay? You're alive! Come on. Wake up! Ha! I did it! We're still alive! Yes! Come on, Googly Eyes! Let's skedaddle! It's stuck. Oh, no! Please help me, you guys. I'm tongue-tied. I shouldn't have tried to eat you. I'm sorry. Okay. I can give you a hand. Have you gone bonkers? What are you doing? It's a trick! He just wants to gobble you up! We'll help you. But you have to promise not to eat us. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okey-dokey. Don't do it! You're gonna end up being his lunch! All done! Oh, great! We're done for now! So much better. Can't tell you how much I appreciate this. No problem. My name's Ruby! Thank you, Ruby. My name's Ribbert. Newsflash! He tried to eat me! I am the king around here. And I promise I will not eat you. Sure. Doesn't look like a king if ya ask me. You guys are from out of town, aren't you? Mm-hmm. Golden Canyon is where we're going. You're gonna love it in Golden Canyon. But you have a long journey ahead, my friends. So, you've been there before? I have not. But my father has told me many stories about it! Cool! Wanna come with us, then? It's too far. I can't go. But it'll be easy for you guys. Oh, really? Just because we can fly, huh? Did you not see these tiny wings? Do I look like a giant bird? Cause I'm not. You're actually on the right track. A giant bird can take you there. And I know just where to find one. Oh? You have to show us the way. You're insane! Stop trying to make us food! Scaredy-bug! Don't you wanna get to Golden Canyon? I am not a scaredy-bug. That was mean. Um... My guards and I can safely escort you to the giant birds. What guards? They invisible? Whoa! I promise not to eat you, but I can't say the same for them. Careful with your words, flyboy. Off we go! There they are! You see? These are the giant birds I spoke of. We made it! - Finally. - Hello! They can get you to Golden Canyon in no time at all. But wait... How do we catch a ride from one? Don't worry. This escort is full service. Whoa! Look out! Nice catch! Truck! What, now there's another one? I did it! We're still alive! Voilà! Safe and sound. It's... bigger than I thought. This is it! Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go! Oh, why do you have to be such a nice guy, Master Dan? There you go! I bid you both farewell! Wait, King Ribbert... Are you sure you can't come? I am a king with frogs to lead. And now I must teach them to live in harmony with insects! Thank you, guys! We'll never forget you! Uh-oh! It's taking off! Travel safely, my friends! Bye-bye, my amphibious friends! Goodbye, Ruby! All right, Golden Canyon, we're coming for you! Whoa. Wait a sec, did the bird's legs just eat us? My antennae! They're gone forever! I'm done for! Oh, there they are. Attention, passengers, welcome aboard. Thank you for flying with us today. Now, sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight. Who... Who is that? That would be me. Hi. Sorry, it's been a while since I've had any passengers. - So, who are you? - Yeah. Oh, whoopsie! Hold on. I've got a whole little thing. I was a small alley earwig. But I knew I was meant to travel the world. Now, I'm Marty the artist! - Huh? - So you're... Marty the artist? Then are you going to Golden Canyon, too? Oh... Did you hear that? That red thing called me an artist! Wait, why would I go to Golden Canyon? That's not our destination. Huh? You're kidding me! That frog king is a lying snake! I can't believe we came all this way for nothing! That's so sad. My best friends have lost all hope! Their quest seemingly impossible now! It's just heartbreaking! I'm sorry I got us into this mess. We should probably just give up. Why don't we just ask? The giant bird will totally help us. People don't just help each other for no reason. That's not true. I'd love to help my best friends! You can get us to Golden Canyon? I'm gonna try. In order to do so, though, I'll have to create a masterpiece! Ah... Eureka! Ah... Oh... I finally did it! I've painted my magnum opus! Mwah! Huh? How does a painting help us? It doesn't. He's an artist. He's crazy. You mean, crazy smart! Hmm? The plane is flying over here. But Golden Canyon is way down here! Which would then mean, based on my calculations, you get off here! He did it! I knew it! I knew King Ribbert wouldn't lie to us! As soon as this giant bird lands, we'll eat till we can't move. Then, we party! Uh... No, no, no. The plane's not landing. Huh? We don't have much time. Come on! Let's go! Oh. I'm gonna need you to turn off your antenna. Don't wanna mess with the plane's radar. Huh? Wait a second, what about yours? These bad boys are on the Wi-Fi. So high-tech. I'm helping my best friends chase their dreams! This is so cool! Just a little further. Scary, huh? I know! Watch your head! Tough part over! Now a little drop and you're there! Huh? "A little drop"? Are you insane? Wait, of course you are! You know what? Let's go back to the plan you had. There's gotta be an easier way! Huh? No. Wait. It was a great idea! I'm sorry! My bad! I never should have made fun of it! No, no, no! Bad idea! Googly Eyes! Hey, Golden Canyon! Here I come! Go! Go and get your destiny! You need a hand. Say what? Hi-ya! Bye, best friends! I love you! Chase those dreams! And never give up! Gross! What is that smell? Ugh! Are we still alive? Yep. Still alive. Master Dan! Don't pull my head off! I'm trying! Oh, man, my thorax is killing me! Master Dan! What's that? Those are big balls of dung. Dung ball on the loose! Sorry, sorry, sorry! Hi, I'm Ruby. Cool dung ball you got there. Quick question. Are we in Golden Canyon right now? This is not Golden Canyon. Way too much dung! Like way too much. You're acting like your dung doesn't stink too. Well, it doesn't, I don't think. That looks heavy! We should help him out, Master Dan! No! Stay away from that dung! Come on! Give us a hand! No way! Huh? Hey! Don't leave me! I'm coming! Whoa... That's a lot of dung! Thanks for helping. So you guys are trying to get to Golden Canyon, right? Mm-hmm. Head that way through the Gilded Forest. You'll get to Golden Canyon soon enough. Yeah? Whoopee! Let's go! We're almost at the finish line! What? So tired. We should get some grub in your tummy. Hm? Please, eat. It's our finest dung. It's all right. No time, sorry. We really should be on our way. Looks great, though. I can take you if you want. That'd be awesome! Hey! This way. Oh. Onward! Wow! That's crazy. I can't believe you went through all that to get here. Yep! But it's all gonna be worth it! I'd do it all over again if I had to. I can't believe we're almost there. You're both so brave. I've never left my home. I'd like to, but I don't think I could ever really do it. All you have to do is believe! Yeah, that's the truth. Don't worry. We've got your back. Oh! Hey, we made it. Googly Eyes did it! My hero! We actually did it! My dream, my destiny... Golden Canyon! Huh? It smells glorious. Ah, the overwhelming scent of diesel gas is intoxicating! Huh? Must be back here. No, this is it. Huh? You said you were looking for Golden Canyon. It's not a canyon. That's a construction site! Very different. I swear to you this is Golden Canyon. I wouldn't lie. What happened? It was supposed to be a beautiful forest. It was a beautiful forest a long time ago. With streams, flowers, and insects. But it's looked just like this ever since I was born. Googly Eyes! Where are you going? Ruby, hold on. This can't be it. Hey, at least we made it here. Let's go grab a bite. It's my treat. I could use a nice massage, too. I left my home to come to this. It's really not that bad. My tummy's grumbling. Let's eat. This was all a big mistake. I should have stayed right where I was. What? Now you're gonna say that? I almost died a bunch of times. A "big mistake"? Yeah, you're not kidding. This is your fault. You told me you'd been to Golden Canyon. Huh? Are you really trying to put the blame on me? You have got to be kidding. You were all, "Oh, my gosh! I wanna go to Golden Canyon!" It was your dumb idea. Fine! Go then! I don't need you anyway. I'll go somewhere else beautiful! Well... good luck with that because I am out of here! For good this time! I'm serious. I'm on my way. You came back! That's the one. Quick! Grab her. What are you doing? Let go of me! Let's head back. Master Dan! Help me! This ain't too shabby. No Golden Canyon but... Life is not bad. Not gonna lie, this place could make for a pretty rad pad! Woo! No! Fly away! Hey! Where are you guys going? What? The Squatty Giant? Whoa! A dragonfly! Super cool! Let me out of here! Where are we? Mommy! How do you like that, you bully? Hey, wait! I'm taking you down! She's tiny but she's so strong. It really hurts! Get her to stop! It's all right! Bad ladybug! Stop that! Please! Buzzbrain! - Do something! - Just chill! We made it. Hear ye! Hear ye! Queenie is arriving! Silence! Hello... Your Highness, she was all we could find. So you're Googly Eyes. No, my name isn't Googly Eyes. It's Ruby. What's your name? Ruby, huh? I need you to tell me where the dragonfly is. Are you talking about Master Dan? I don't know where he is. Do not lie for that con bug. He must pay for what he's done. So, where is he? Master Dan isn't a con bug. There must be some kind of mix-up! What do you think he did to you? He told us stories of a faraway land. One with an abundance of resources. We traveled to this "Golden Canyon" and found it a desolate wasteland. We gave up everything to get here. This "Master Dan" must face judgment! But... but wait! This place was a paradise! He wasn't lying! You do not raise your voice to a queen. Now, tell me where he is! A scout returns! Your Highness... I have tracked down the dragonfly for you. You have? The Squatty Giant has him. Squatty Giant? His misdeeds finally caught up with him. His punishment will be far greater than one we could deliver. Justice has been served. Oh... You can let the ladybug go now. The Squatty Giant's reign of terror continues. Yes. That beast has taken many of our friends and family. What does the giant do to them? Not sure... But he captures them in these small glass jars. Let me outta here! You're messing with the wrong bug! Save your breath, dragonfly. Don't fight the inevitable. There is no escape from here. I'm going to save him! I applaud your courage. But you really shouldn't risk your life for that deceitful dragonfly. Says you! Master Dan is my friend. I'd do anything for him! I have to save him. He'd do it for me! Yeah, well, good luck with that. Oh, it's gonna happen! I guarantee it! But you must be very careful. Saving your friend will be extremely dangerous. To this very day, I still have nightmares! The Squatty Giant's that bad? The Squatty Giant is the least of your worries. There is a creature in the Squatty Giant's lair that lurks in the shadows, patiently waiting for the right time. When the sun disappears and the world is consumed by the night, he emerges from his veil of darkness. He makes his way through the lair, climbing with ease, until he arrives at the jars, ready to feast. The beast's name? The Mighty Rex! You're looking tasty. No! So scary! What? It's nighttime now. We need to go! - I'm sorry. - Right away. But you are on your own, brave one. The danger is far too great for us. Well, fine then! My best friend's in danger! And I'm going to go save him! Then that is your decision. But don't forget, I tried to warn you. Another good bug lost... Such a pity. Such a pity... What if I got caught? Would you all come save me? What if Rex found out about this place? No! I don't want to be eaten. I'm never gonna be able to sleep now. If we work together, we can defeat Rex for good! No way. Don't drag us into this mess. This is your fight. Yeah... I don't want to fight a monster. I'm leaving, taking my family. Gonna move some place safe. Fine then. Can anyone show me where the Squatty Giant's home is? Oh, sure. No problem. This place doesn't look that scary. Come on, what are we waiting for? It is very scary. We gotta go full stealth. Freaking out right now. But the coast is clear. Giddy up. Hey! Ruby? Ruby? Where'd she go? Where'd she go? Wait for me! That didn't go as planned. There's some kind of force field. I bet there's an opening somewhere. Slow down, please! What? It's true. I saw them enter the Squatty Giant's lair. I can't believe Ruby's actually doing it. I wish I had a friend who would do that for me. Wow, she's so brave. She's out of her mind! Her and Frank versus Rex? Enough. I don't want to hear another word about that ladybug. She decided to put her life at risk for a liar. That's her own fault. I'm still worried. I wonder if she'll make it. Did none of you hear what I just said? Just drop it. Your Highness, please forgive me but... I think Ruby was right. I think we should help her fight Rex. If we don't do something, our friends' and families' lives will continue to be in danger. I think... it's finally time to stand up to that monster! Well, I'll be. I'm tired of being afraid all the time! - Let's do this! - I'm in! I'll take that punk down myself! Huh? Sorry. I got caught up with the whole yelling things. Don't really think I could pull that off. Who knew a tiny ladybug could leave such a strong impression on us? Showing how brave even the smallest bug can be. Let us help! For Ruby! I'm not sure. Hey, Master Dan! Whoa! Hey! Master Dan! Googly Eyes? Great. You're hearing things now. Hi! It's really you! I'm still mad at you. You hurt my feelings. You were really mean! Why did you come anyway? I came because you're my best friend! Sorry I was all grouchy. I forgive you. Googly Eyes! Get outta here! Quickly! Before the monster gets here! No one's going anywhere! How kind of you to bring me a dessert, dragonfly. I might just have to spoil my dinner. You'll have to catch me! Oh, playing hard to get? I like that. You want me? Come and get me! You dinosaur wannabe! I'll kick your tail back to... Googly Eyes! Get over here! Ahh! How do you like that? I'm getting bored with this. Yeah! Playtime's over. Get in my belly! Your breath smells prehistoric! - Googly Eyes! - Wait until you smell my stomach! You put up a good fight, but the Mighty Rex never loses! Whoa! Good shot. What's he dancing for? Huh? Master Dan strikes again! Hi-ya! Whoa! Look at all those other bugs still trapped in jars! Master Dan, we can't just leave them sitting in there. Let's break them out! What a great idea! That's what I was gonna say. How... how are we gonna open all these things? We can't even open one of them. There's like a million of them. Wait! I got it! Huh? Come on! Give me a hand! Uh... Okay. You're crazy! You forget we're insects. There's no way we can fly these out of here! We just gotta push them off the ledge. But Googly Eyes, if we push them off the ledge, the jars are gonna break! Wait a second... If we can break the jars, then they'll be free to escape. I'm a genius! I figured out how to save them! Great, Master Dan. Now do you feel like helping? Oh, yeah. Right. Sorry. I'm free! We did it! We actually did it! Yeah! We're not done yet. We've still got a lot more jars to break! And push! Yay, thank you! I can help. Woo! Yes! Woo! That's it, guys! Yeah! Keep it up! Let freedom ring! Whoa! Whoa! This is wonderful! Fresh air! I hate to dampen the mood but we gotta figure a way out of here fast. I'm coming, Ruby! Hey, everyone! Sorry I'm late. I had to go through the front door. Frank, you beautiful bug! Come on, everyone! Let's go! Oh, wow. A lot of you guys. Okay! Come on! Right through there! Hurry! Huh? Ninja run! Keep coming! We're almost there. Just a little bit further... Just up ahead, there's an open window we can use to get out. Go, go, go! Looks like I'll be having a feast tonight. We're not scared of you! If we stand together, we'll defeat you! That's cute but I think you've overestimated your friends' courage. Ruby's right. Let's show him what we're made of! Yeah! How sweet. Thanks for making this easier for me! Foolish ladybug. You thought I could be defeated by insects... Don't you dare touch that ladybug, you stegosaurus reject! Did you just threaten me, bug? That's exactly what I did. Finally! It's time to get it on. Whoa! The Royal Guard? They're here to help us! Don't forget me! I came too! Great, guys! Fight with bravery! Tonight will be remembered forever! Stop flying and fight me! Thank you. Queenie's kicking tail! The queen's sting shows no mercy, lizard! Neither does my tongue! We're all lined up! It's go time! You'll pay for that. Ouch! Sure. Send the bill to "Master Dan's Super Fruit-a-pult!" Time for our secret weapon. Ready? Let's go! We're coming for you! All right! That's it. You guys want to fight dirty? I'll fight dirty. Hey, where'd he go? That's not good! He's camouflaged! Don't let your guard down! Man your positions! Fire as soon as you see him! I'm freaking out! Is that him? Maybe he left. Huh? He's right behind you! Behind who? Behind you! Quick! Alpha team, charge! Bye-bye. Where is he? Bravo team! Go! - He disappeared again! - Anyone see him? You thought you could defeat me? I knew insects had tiny brains, but come on. He's right! My brain is really tiny! This tiny brain's got an idea! What are you doing? You look like you could use some extra muscle. Thanks, Extra Muscle! Yes. Of course! Use it so he won't be able to hide! I've rescued us yet again! All right, guys. Get him! I don't need tricks to defeat brainless bugs! Yeah? Then bring it on! You've been a real thorn in my scales! Huh? Would you care for a dash of pepper with your dinner? Not pepper... Just a touch. Have some more. Whoa... Cool. So, score one for the brainless bugs. I can't believe it either, guys. I gave him the one-two hyah! We can celebrate at home. We need to go. Ready to get going? That's everyone. Good! Let's get out of here. Oh, no! What happened? Mom's gonna kill me! Why would you do this, Rex? You have been a bad lizard. A very bad lizard! You are grounded, Rex! For at least a week! Wow! Pretty good! ...and that's when the hideous monster cornered me. But Master Dan wasn't afraid. You see, I'm a kung fu master! So I karate chopped him, like this. - I tell you, that lizard... - May I have a word? But of course. He was out for the count. Your Highness... The bravest bug should bow to no one. I would like to thank you. You showed me how to be a true leader. This was nothing though. I've been in way worse situations. One time, I... Hey, finish the story! Go away! Any way you could forgive Master Dan? I can. I wish you would stay, but I know your heart isn't here. I have to keep looking for Golden Canyon. Hey, you wanna follow me to Golden Canyon? Together, we could find a way! I mean, come on. It's me. It's my mission! You can be my sidekick! But Ruby... Golden Canyon no longer exists. Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Goodbye, everyone! Take care! I'll miss you! Aw, look at that. You got so excited to be my sidekick, you left without me. Hold on, Ruby! I'm supposed to be taking the lead on this! You're just the sidekick! Wait up! This is bad, real bad! - What's wrong? - I made a little oopsie! What? This is not a little oopsie! Oh, no! - This is a gigantic oopsie! - This is bad! Maybe they're over here. Ah, woo!
