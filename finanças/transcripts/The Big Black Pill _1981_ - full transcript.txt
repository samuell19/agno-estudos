[ Whimsical music playing ] [ Big band music playing ] Joe dancer's voice: Los Angeles, California-- one huge produce market, land of fruits and nuts, the last exit to mecca for people running away, mostly from themselves. But occasionally you turn a corner and find somebody to like. My name's Joe dancer and I work this town. I carry a faded piece of paper that says i'm a private detective. And because of it I live on the edge. Clients only hire me when the police won't handle it, lawyers and friends won't touch it or if the deal is too shady. Everybody has a heartache. Some try to solve it for themselves, others try other ways. Who's to say who's right? I handle people's garbage. I get paid for it. I was on my way to the orphanage where I grew up. The old poker sack who ran the joint was trying to get in touch with me. Figured she wanted something. I loved her and she loved me, but we stopped talking about it long ago. If I live to be a thousand, I'll always be five years old when I come to visit here. I keep this place secret, separate, and safe from my world. In my line of work, you keep a lot of distance between the things you love and yourself. If you take a fall, you're the only one who gets hurt. I intend to talk with you. Go to sleep. Say your prayers. Now to get back to you. When I called for you, you didn't respond to me. That wasn't the least bit nice of you, Joseph, and you were such a nice little boy. - You mind? - Yes, I do mind. You are not going to make any phone calls until we talk about this Ferris wheel. Well, then do you have a little... Yes, I have a little nip for you. I'm not foolish enough to think that I could get you to stand still without one. Sister, the last time I got a snort out of you this easy, it cost me. We want to have a carnival with games and races to raise money. And we need a Ferris wheel. And the bishop says no dice. He thinks we've been to the well once too often. Well, I can't think why. You've only been picking his pockets for 40 years and he don't even like this joint. No one is going to close this home. How much? Well, um, the first-- well, I have several notes here about-- you know all the people in the street, and the neighborhood has been absolutely marvelous. Now we're going to have... Dancer's voice: I only half heard what she was saying. It took me a minute to get my head in the right place, to look beyond how pretty she was and see the nun. It wasn't easy. Oh, excuse me. Sister Theresa, this is the young man that I was telling you about, Joseph dancer. Oh, yes, the man who's gonna be kind enough to help US. Sister, you're the one they hired to run this place when sister Clara goes out to pasture? With all due respect, you look like those little two-step-away- from-the-penitentiary rug rats in there could wrap you up and deliver you for a Christmas present. I appreciate your concern, Mr. Dancer. I'll try to keep that in mind. Joseph, sister Theresa has transferred from attica. Remember the riots? We don't all wear pants in the world, Mr. Dancer, but we all get along, don't we? I think you can make your phone call now. Yeah. [ Phone ringing ] Where the hell have you been? You said you were going to call at 5:30. Do you know what time it is? Oh, sweetheart, you got such a beautiful personality. Listen, save that line for whatever lady is in the room with you right now, okay? I got other dummies here I'm working on. Hey, listen, we got a lot of messages from all over the world, Joe, and one sounds like money. Where do you want me to start? Upper left-hand corner, letter "a". Uh, Bernie serica-- the man from D.C. Who I don't know who he is because you never told me-- called. You still don't know anything about him, but if he calls, I'm working on it. Okay. Get to the money call. She sounded like vassar or barnard, you know? And I told her that you were working on a case. And she said she was sure you would find the time. So, Joe, I made an appointment for you for 9:30 tonight. You are going fishing. Charlie, you know that personality improvement course you're working on? Get another one. On what, the salary you pay me? My name is Tiffany farinpour. Are you Joe dancer? Mm-hmm. Do you always meet prospective clients out here? You do have an office. Yeah. Folks in my line of work got a habit of getting dusted - along with their desks. - Excuse me? Nothing. Hold that for me, will you? So how'd you come to give me a call? State senator Dixon recommended you very highly. Mr. Dancer, I know there's a reason for my holding this fishing dole. Am I going to have to ask why? That's the first law of the jungle: You always fish with your back to the ocean. I only like to fish when there's something to catch. - Are they biting? - The big ones do. The little ones just kiss and fool around. Talk to me, miss farinpour. I want you to find my younger brother. His name is David. Why? My family, Mr. Dancer, has had its share of disagreements. Families have disagreements. Why do you want me to find your brother? David left the family. I stayed. I was wrong. I want him to know that. I want him to know that I love him. I haven't seen my brother in over a year. I want to have him found. It's just that simple. No, it isn't, miss farinpour. Nothing's that simple. And nothing in this world smells like what it is, or what people say it is. I was told you were for hire. I'm for hire, but only on cases I think are legit. I'm not saying you're not legit. I'm just saying you haven't convinced me, not yet. Mr. Dancer, I love my brother and I need your help to find him. I don't know what else to say. Miss farinpour, with a family like yours-- I mean... You have an older brother who's a councilman running for governor-- you have a battery of lawyers. You don't need me. I don't want the rest of my family involved in this. This is between David and me. I love that boy. He's my brother. I don't have a husband or a career. I didn't realize how much I cared for David until recently. I get $200 a day. And $1,000 if I find your brother. And you can fire me anytime you want. I need $500 in advance. I have a photo of David and a check. It's signed. You can fill in the amount. If it's all the same to you, I'll cash this before I get started. Mr. Dancer, the way you fish, it's a wonder you ever catch anything. Yeah, but i'm still alive. And I catch one once in a while. Uh, pal, can I have a burrito and a black coff--? Dame UN burro con cafe negro para llevar. Okay. Dancer's voice: I had some favors owed to me downtown. I cashed a couple of markers when I began my search for David farinpour. I checked the telephone company and the I.R.S. Both came up empty. The only bingo was the d.M.V. Keep it. David owned a new four-wheel. He and his four-wheel were cited for running a stop sign in a little town in the Santa Clara valley. But with my luck, David was just passing through and was now living in Zanzibar. They told me to start collecting butterflies, do anything, but just forget that I ever heard the name David farinpour. I knew better than to reach for my gun. The arm pressing into my windpipe told me it knew exactly what I was thinking. The trouble is, when you live on the edge there's always some dude that's got the edge on you. They were professionals and my instincts told me to follow their advice-- buy a butterfly collecting kit. Funny, this could have been a routine drive. Because of them, it wasn't. The juices were flowing again. I wanted to know what was waiting for me. I was being cautious. I wasn't going to be tailed. The drive was long. I had time to ask myself a lot of questions. One of two things had happened: The two gorillas had tailed Tiffany when she came to meet me, or somebody tipped them that I was looking for the farinpour kid. Like I told Tiffany at the beach, nothing was simple, nothing smelled like what it was in this world. Tiffany wanted David found. Whoever the gorillas were working for didn't. Wouldn't it be nice to someday get hired to do something that everybody wanted done? Last question: Did Tiffany know somebody didn't want her brother found? Nobody laughed and nobody fainted when I showed them a snapshot of the kid. And nobody gave me any information.

That's nice work. Thanks. - Oh, it's yours? - Uh-huh. Well, you do very nice work, sister Sara. Well, thank you. My name's not Sara, but I'll answer to it if you're buying. I'm buying. How much? $20. Hold the change. No, I'm buying, I'm buying. But I'm also looking. Don't worry, I'm not the fuzz. I'm looking for him. He likes Indian jewelry a lot. Somebody misses him very much. Three weeks ago he bought two matching squash blossoms. What's a squatch-- squash blossom? That is the Indian name for these necklaces. Ah. Why two? Did he have somebody with him? No. Maybe he's got a girlfriend. Maybe he's got a girlfriend. Like I said, Sara, you do nice work. Thank you. Dancer's voice: I laid the $50 on her, gave her back her merchandise and was told about a old ranch way out in the country. I could find it if I followed the railroad tracks. It was beautiful country. I wondered to myself what a rich kid from a jillionaire family was doing living way out here with the jackrabbits. [ Sheep bleating ] If you're looking for the lake, it's on the other side of the highway. I'm not looking for the lake. Fresh oregano, tomatoes-- you got a nice garden, kid. Plenty of quail, rabbit. You do all right, huh? Not a bad way to live. Magazines, books, a typewriter-- you come out here to write the great American novel? Are you a literary agent? Nope. Private dick. Your sister sent me out here with a message. Allegra? This one called herself Tiffany. I didn't know there was another one. I guess you made a long, dusty trip here for nothing. I don't do nothing for nothing, kid. I got paid. Then enjoy the sun and leave whenever you feel like it, 'cause as far as I'm concerned, Tiffany and I have nothing to say to one another. - Yeah? - Yeah. Anyway, the message goes, she wants to apologize. She wants you to know it. I don't know if she's playing games. She gave me the money-- I'm here. She says she loves you. She says she misses you and she wants to see you. What do you got to lose, one day away from the country? How'd you find me? Checked with the d.M.V., found out you got a traffic ticket for running a red light and I had a funny conversation with a pretty Indian Princess. You didn't answer my question. Let me think about it. Good. You sure got a pretty place here. [ Gunshot ] [ Gunfire continues ] [ Train horn blaring ] [ Horn blaring ] Hang on, kid. We made it. Hang on, kid. Hang on. Attaboy. Attaboy. We got it made now. We got it made now. Kid? Kid? Dancer's voice: I had lied to the kid. We didn't make it. I did. Hell of an end for a nice kid who just wanted to raise tomatoes and be left alone. What did it mean? Everything was gone-- David's garden, the goats, the chickens-- everything. No trace of David's car. No trace of mine. The tire tracks were even erased. No live rounds. No dead ones. His books, his clothes, his furniture-- gone. Nothing to show that David farinpour had ever lived there. Nothing to show that anybody had ever lived there. It was six miles to the nearest highway, so I paced myself. My mind traveled in two directions: One direction was the gorillas who had worked me over. I had no way of knowing who they were or where they were. The other direction was Tiffany. And then I saw it. Had somebody done me a favor or was the car wired to take me out? After I checked the car and found out it was cool, it was 40 miles to town and to the address that Tiffany had given me. I bribed my way past the guy at the door. Part of me wanted to go upstairs and comfort her, but the part of me that had been around the block too many times told me everybody was a suspect. I had to test her. I had to get my hands on the small of her back where the muscles don't lie. I had to know once and for all what she was made of, whose side she was on. - Hello. - Hi. - What happened to you? - Nothing. Nothing. Did you find David? Yes. I found him and I, uh, talked to him. Hang on, Tiffany. This is gonna be rough. Like I said, I talked to him... And then somebody put a bullet in his heart. Your brother is dead. No, you're lying. No one would kill David. I'm sorry. David died in my arms. And whoever killed him tried to kill me too. David never hurt anyone. Tiffany. Tiffany. - What? - Tiffany. What? - Oh, no. - Just take it easy. - Okay. - [ Sobbing ] Okay, let it all out. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He's gone and there's nothing we can do about that, but I promise you we'll find out who did it. Oh, David. He never hurt anybody. He was the only decent thing that ever happened to me and my family. I know. I loved him. I know. I promise you we'll find out who killed him. I promise you that. We have to find out who killed him. Yes. Yes, we will. What did the police say? I didn't tell the police. Oh. Tiffany, where are you going? I'm calling the police. No no, wait wait. You can't do that. I have to explain to you why. When I got back to where David lived, they, whoever they are-- they had moved everything. His trailer was empty. The yard was empty. Even my car was gone. The only thing that I can prove is that I was there. That makes me the number-one suspect. Don't you see? David is gone. I'm-- I'm sorry. Maybe we're both to blame. Maybe we'll both have to live with that the rest of our lives, but sending myself to jail is not going to help anything. I can't deliver anything to the police except me and David's body. The police are not gonna find out who killed him, I am. I promise you that. Where is my brother? I put his body in a safe place. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh my god. Dancer's voice: I got her to take a couple of nembutal and I stashed her in one of the rented places I kept around town. I figured she'd sleep for at least 24 hours and hopefully when she woke I'd be there. I spent a useless night and was starting the day with a cheeseburger and a little sour mash when the heat nailed me. He told me jacqualone was waiting for me in the park. Jacqualone was homicide. He didn't like me and I didn't like him. The people of this state are going to vote whether to reinstate the death penalty. Which way are you going, dancer? I would think that someone who lives the way you do would have to give that a great deal of consideration. You ever raise pigeons, dancer? Nope. What do you think of them? The ones that fly or the ones that blow the whistle or the ones that get suckered? All three of them. They come with the turf. You got color in your cheeks. You been out in the sun? The neon lights in the bars. I got a call. I figured you did. The party on the other end of the line talked about a David farinpour, about a murder and Joe dancer. So I talked to a sweet little girl in the country selling jewelry. She said someone had asked her about a David farinpour. Her description fit you. She wondered when you were coming back. Did you find anything? Stop dancing around, dancer. You know I didn't find anything. But with that girl's statement I can hold you. The body will turn up. They always do. I think we're gonna reinstate the death penalty. What do you think? I think I could use a couple of days to get my voice back. Sure, I got a couple of days. And that's all you got. So you stay in touch, dancer, or you know what I'll do. The suntan looks good. I'd hate to see you turn gray in a cell. Dancer's voice: Whoever fingered me was connected with the murder and wanted me to fry for it. Jacqualone smelled blood and wouldn't quit till he got what he wanted-- Joe dancer, murder one. I needed answers fast, so I went to the answer man. Years ago Wally had 10 reporters on his payroll and a syndicated column. After a lot of great stories and a pulitzer prize, what he had left was his birds, his tropical garden, his booze and a mysterious way of knowing things. We had markers going back 20 years. We didn't know who owed who. We'd stopped counting a long time ago. We hoisted one and I told him my problem: An hour ago I was working on a murder case. Now I was trying to stay out of the cooker myself. I asked Wally for a rundown on the farinpour family. He talked about two sisters, Allegra and Tiffany, two brothers, David and councilman jerrold, and how after the old man had croaked, the widow Eliza had taken over the reins. I could have got that from the library. What I needed was a hell of a lot more. I know what you need, Joe. I know you're in a wringer and I know that's why you're here. You know, in all my life there were only two stories I had to back away from. One of them I can't even tellyou about. The other was the farinpours. Let me dig through these files, see what I can come up with. Give me a little time. That's what I got-- a little time. Dancer's voice: Wally had planted a seed. Was David's death a byproduct of the farinpour dynasty? Had somebody gotten even? Did the farinpours know about David's death? Had jacqualone told them about the call? If the answer was yes, did they know about me? I conned my way onto the farinpour estate with some jive about a d.D.T. Contamination. I saw some dippy broad shooting pictures. It looked like she snorted enough coke to sink a battleship. I figured for sure she'd bust me, but she just walked away. Why? The guard that let me in was a breeze. Why? It was like I was an expected guest. Good morning. I'd just like a few words with the head of the household. Who gave you permission to come onto this property? Mrs. Farinpour, I think I'd better handle this. Who are you, sir, and what do you want? I'm a private investigator. Mrs. Farinpour, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a few questions. My name is Joe dancer. Indeed. Well, as long as you're here... Dancer's voice: She sent the monkey suit to get a cup of coffee and asked me to sit down. We blue-skied for a while about nothing in particular. She was a sharp woman, cunning and clever as a snake. When the time was right I hit her with a left hook. But she came back with a haymaker that put me away. You do know that he's dead, I expect. May I ask, Mrs. Farinpour, how you know? He was visited by someone-- a man. The man lured him outside. There was shooting. David was assassinated. The killer escaped. Then the, uh, police have the matter well in hand. I don't believe we quite understand one another, Mr. Dancer. The police would only stir up negative excitement. Don't you agree? Yes. This is being handled then by the farinpours personally? In a manner of speaking. Suppose the farinpours offered you... $10,000 to capture the man who killed my son? Well, I'd certainly have to think about that. Of course, you'll want to speak to jerrold. That's councilman farinpour. He's the only one of US with all the details of the case. I see. You do understand that the entire issue is strictly confidential, don't you? Yes, I understand. Dancer's voice: I had a check in my pocket for 10 grand and my brain was registering tilt. She knew who I was and what I was and had offered me hush money and I was damned if I knew what for. Nice, really nice. How about one with you in the car, huh? You must be the one they call Allegra. You always take pictures of your mother's guests? Only the ones I find interesting. What do you do, put them in a scrapbook? No. I make them materialize if I'm lonely or bored. Well, we're getting along so charming here, - I hate to break it up. - Then don't. How good a private detective are you, Mr. Dancer? I sneak along. Let me give you a little piece of advice in your own vernacular: You'd better stay in your own ballpark because you don't belong in this one. Drive fast. Dancer's voice: It stood to reason that the farinpours were antsy about negative excitement. The councilman didn't want any ripples in his campaign for governor. When I got to his office I'd found out he was in El centro talking to the farm workers. I decided to drop in on farinpour's opposition in the governor's race-- commissioner Charlie wilke, an off-the-board longshot. Oh, yeah, of course I remember you, Joe. - Come on in. - Thanks. Sit down. What can I do for you? And will it keep me honest? I just got a couple of questions for you. You're running for governor. You think you got any kind of chance to beat farinpour? Do the saints have a chance against the rams? Yeah, that's what I figured. How come you're running? Well, to gain more public recognition, a shot at another office. You don't have any plan-- I mean, last-minute big disclosure or something like that? The farinpour family has virtually run this state since 1948. It'll take a bombshell to unseat them. Some of US are not born with a hook shot. You know what I think, commissioner? I think they got skeletons. Nobody even knows what they look like. Not yet. Thanks for your time. Dancer's voice: I badgered a few more friends in city hall, then headed back where I left my car. The place was quiet-- a tomb chock-full of Detroit iron. The silence was just what I needed to remind me what I found out about the farinpours-- nothing. - [ Keys jingle ] - I heard some keys hit the cement. I knew I had company. Lose something? No, I'm looking for butterflies. Come on, get up. Spread. We told you not to press for the farinpour kid, dancer. Now what happened out there? - Nothing. - Remember now? [ Screaming ] Never mind. Let him go. Come on. [ Moaning ] At the trailer with the kid, what happened? [ Grunts ] - Somebody croaked him. - You croaked him! - No. - The kid, did he say anything before he died? We just blue-skied. What the hell do you two dummies want with me anyway? Answers. And we want them now, sweet pea. We're going to stick your hand in there. And you're going to lose one finger at a time. Now you tell US, and you tell US good. Did the kid give you anything? He didn't give me nothing. I can't hear you, friend. I said he didn't give me nothing! I don't know nothing! Don't you understand? I'm the one who's on the hook for killing the kid in the first place. Tell US or you lose your hand. Then go ahead, do it and get it over with! But you'd better stick my head in there and kill me because I don't know nothing! [ Sirens blaring ] You hear me? I said I don't know nothing! A couple of punks, that's what you are. A couple of punks. I don't know nothing. Who the hell are you working for in the first place? You ain't nothing! Don't you understand? Those gorillas were trying to kill me. David knew something or he had something. You're his sister. If you love him half as much as you say you did, then he told you. What did he know? What do you know?! - He didn't tell me anything. - You're a liar! You're a liar. He wanted to come and see you. That means that he loved you. He told you. He didn't tell me anything. Stop screaming at me! - You have no right. - I have every right! I'm the one they're trying to kill! Stop screaming at me! How do you think I feel knowing that all of this is going to lead to my mother? She's a pollutant and I detest her, but she is my mother. Now whatever David knew or whatever he had, it was something that only he and my mother were aware of. I have no idea what it was, but I'm sure that whatever it is could destroy the farinpours. That's what she was so afraid of. I've had nightmares about it. See, my mother is possessed with her drive to make jerrold governor because for her it is only a stepping stone. Because the only thing that she has ever really wanted and the only thing that she couldn't drive my father to buy for her is that big white columned house in Washington. And even though my-- my father is dead, she's determined to get it. My baby brother-- I should have left him alone out there where he was safe. You were innocent. You didn't know what was going on. I should have known better. No, Tiffany. I'm the detective. That's my ballpark. I should have been smarter. I'm sorry. I was wrong about you and I'm sorry. Tiffany, it's late and people get crazy when they're tired. I'll-- I'll take you home. No. No. Oh, it's a beautiful morning. [ Imitates Stan Laurel] It certainly is, Ollie. It was a beautiful night too. How do you like your coffee? Just a little cream. Joe you know, this apartment-- it's so bare. There's nothing of you here. [ Chuckles ] There ain't much of me anyplace, darling. I keep three or four of these things around. I rent them by the month. Then a couple of times a year i-- oh my goodness... - Good morning. - Good morning. Uh, apartments, right. I-- I change them three or four times a year. [ Sighs ] No roots, no ties, huh? - That's no way to live. - Nope. Good way to stay alive though. Joe, shouldn't we go to the police? We can't do that. I told you. I'm still the number-one suspect. Where we're going is-- where you're going is to your apartment. And I'm going out to where David lived. What for? 'Cause he knew something or he had something. And somebody thinks I got it - or I know it or something. - [ Gunshot ] [ Screams ] Stay down! Stay here. Stay here. [ Tires screech ] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. They thought that mirror was you. Who the hell wants you dead? Dance's voice: I tried to think of a safe place to hide her so I could get underway. But there wasn't anyplace. I couldn't go to the heat and I damn sure couldn't leave her here. Who wanted to kill Tiffany anyway? I decided to take her with me. I'd made enough mistakes already. I didn't know what I was looking for, but there weren't any answers in town. There had to be some out here. Come on this way, honey. [ Cows mooing ] Whoever shot your brother was right here in this pile of junk. Go ahead. He must have been watching. He saw everything-- me driving up... David was there, then we went inside. Last time I saw him, he was standing right here, shooting at me. Joe... Let me see those. I know these glasses. They're trotter's. That guy that works for your family? Honey, these are those, uh, pilot glasses. There's millions of 'em all over the world. How do you know they're his? He's worn the same kind of glasses for as long as I can remember. When I was a little girl I used to play with them. They're prescription. What was trotter doing out here? He was killing your brother. Come on. This ain't gonna float. What the hell have I really got? A flimsy case against trotter, a pair of glasses? What did those gorillas want who worked me over? What do I tell jacqualone-- I got a pair of glasses and a pipe dream? What difference does it make? - Won't he believe you? - No, they won't believe-- what's the matter? Nothing. Just stand there. When David got shot he fell right there, against the wall. If trotter shot him, there's no way in the world that would have happened. He would have fallen over here. But he didn't. He fell right here.. I came over and I took him in my arms. Trotter didn't kill your brother. Whoever did it shot him from out there. But you would have seen him. Yeah, but I didn't see him. I heard David hit the wall. I have no idea what you're talking about. I heard David hit the wall and then I heard the shot. That means a high-powered rifle. Trotter was firing a pistol. With a high-powered rifle the slug gets there first, then you hear the shot. That's why whoever killed David had to be out here someplace. - Do you understand? - No, I don't. Dancer's voice: I'd been behind on this caper from the start, but I was beginning to come up with a few answers. And the more answers I got, the more frightened I was about what was at the end of the trail. He parked down there and came up the back side of this hill so nobody would see him. Who was he hiding from, David or me? Maybe trotter. Or was he working with trotter? This is it. He laid right down here. He had some kind of a bipod. That means one of those fancy military weapons. He laid here and he killed David. Dancer's voice: Eliza farinpour had talked as though she knew I had killed her son. What was she trying to do, gaslight me? Somebody had copped to jacqualone. But if it was the farinpours, what was their reason for not coming up with their eyewitness, trotter? He was there. He saw everything. He could finger me. Maybe they didn't cop to jacqualone. But if they didn't, who did? Maybe trotter knew about the sniper. Was he working both sides of the street? If he was, I had the goods on him and maybe if I squeezed him hard enough he'd cop, he'd roll over and tell me who he was working with. It was beginning to add up. I didn't know what my first move was, but I knew I couldn't take Tiffany with me. My best bet was to run the bluff on trotter, but I had to find him first. I found myself back at the farinpour joint talking with the coke-head sister. Wow, you and your car look a little haggard. Uh, your mother's errand boy, trotter, where is he? What you need is a bath. There's nobody home and i-- lady, I don't have time to play toy duck. I don't know what your game is. I don't know what anybody's game is. All I know is the only decent person connected with this whole thing is dead. And I think I got a handle on who did it. This has something to do with my brother's death, right? You got it. - I would help you. - Where's trotter? With my brother jerrold at his office, city hall. May I help you, please? I'm sorry, sir. - It's all right. - Mr. Farinpour isn't seeing anyone. Councilman, my name is Joe dancer. I work for your mother. Hey, you... You might need these next time you're out in the country. Go on, take 'em. Go on, pick 'em up. They're yours. Pick 'em up. Pick 'em up. You were out there, weren't you, trotter? Huh? I found your glasses. You're the one who killed the kid. And then you tried to Bury me right alongside him, didn't you? He's the one, Mr. Farinpour. He killed David. I saw him. You're lying. You killed the kid. You were out there hiding in that pile of junk all by yourself and you did it-- all alone, trotter. I saw David fall. - And you killed him. - You're a liar - and I'm gonna fry you for it. - Gentlemen. Gentlemen! Trotter works for me, Mr. Dancer, and he reported that you were at David's and that you killed him. It never occurred to US that a professional might take his life. I see. I killed him, huh? And then trotter here took it upon himself to clean the whole place up, empty the trailer, make it look like the kid never existed? Why did you do all that? Just for me? Why did your mother hire me? To turn myself in? Quite frankly, Mr. Dancer, as long as you keep quiet until after the election, we don't care what you do. Well, somebody better give me a good reason to be quiet, because I didn't kill the kid. No? With these and trotter's testimony, I'd say it was an airtight case. I didn't kill him. You know it - and he knows it. - [ Phone ringing ] But I'm gonna find out who did. And when I do, I'm gonna fry him. And I don't care what office he holds. - [ Intercom buzzes ] - Secretary: Councilman farinpour, Mr. Dancer has a phone call. It's a woman and she's very insistent on talking to him. By all means take the call, Mr. Dancer. It must be you. What do you want? Joe, a very ugly voice just got off the phone with me and they said to tell you you'd better get over to Wally haskell's right away. I'll be there. Councilman... If you're playing half as rough as I think you are... Dancer's voice: I wished my car could fly. What had I gotten Wally into? I tried to cloud my mind with other thoughts: Had trotter been telling the truth? What did David have that everybody wanted? I tried, but all the questions faded and all I saw was my old friend Wally haskell. Wally? Wally? [ Birds chirping loudly ] Wally had been warm and safe, content with his birds, his plants and his memories. Then I had sent him out on the street to help me solve a murder. Now there were two murders to solve. [ Phone ringing ] Hello. Man: Friend, what took you so long? Did you find everything there you needed? Did you get the answers you asked for? Oh, by the way, there's a lady here-- sister Theresa. She's a real nice lady. Would you like to talk to her? Sister Theresa: Mr. Dancer, it's me. Man: We'd like you to meet with US. Paradise cove at the end of the pier. Half an hour. We don't have to say anything dumb like they do in the movies, like "be alone," do we? No. I'll be there. Keep moving. Get aboard. All the way forward. Where are we going? You're going bye-bye, friend. Now turn around. Wait a minute. Before you do that, if you hurt sister Theresa in any way, I ain't leading you to nothing. All bets are off. How does the head feel? The head's fine. [ Moans ] What does this have to do with Ferris wheels? What--? Ow! I'm Eliza farinpour. Pardon US, but if Mr. Dancer hadn't been so clever, this never would have happened. Oh, but it has, hasn't it? Mr. Dancer's my friend. Then I suggest you urge him to comply with the terms of his employment. I know nothing about his work, Mrs. Farinpour. What's important to me is his integrity. And I'm going to urge him to keep that. Take it easy, sister. They already killed a helpless old man. David deserves a decent burial. Don't you agree? Why haven't you had the kindness to return his remains? Mrs. Farinpour, the day that body turns up I'm expendable. I don't know why. Supposing you tell me what's so important about David's body. I'll tell you and maybe you'll understand why I'll stop at nothing. The farinpour dynasty is at stake, not to mention my son's election, and I'm starting to become impatient. So am I, Mrs. Farinpour. Two people are dead. And if you think I'm going to turn over that kid's body just to pull the councilman's chestnuts out of the fire, - well, think again! - Mr. Dancer, suppose I instructed these gentlemen to... borrow a child or two from the orphanage? You despicable excuse for a human being! Please god! Leave her alone. Now, Mr. Dancer, will you tell me where David's body is or do I instruct these men to go to the orphanage? [ Muttering ] No. I put him on a train. Speak up! I-- I put him on a train, in the refrigerator car. The car's on the number-two siding in cudahy. In which car, Mr. Dancer? I don't know. Take them both to the stateroom. Sister? Sister? Are you all right? What do you mean, am I all right? Are you all right? You're supposed to be fainted. What's all that? Well, in attica the prisoners told me when you're up against a wall with nowhere to go... - Yeah? - ...Play dead. The prisoners told you that? Yeah. It worked. It certainly did. Sister, give me a push. - Can you swim? - Yeah. Okay, you gotta go. Hit the water. See you later. No, I'm not leaving without you. Look, sister, you just saw I can't make it through that hole. You're our only chance. You gotta go. Well, I am not leaving without you. - [ Footsteps ] - Now listen, up till now I've been pretty proud of you. But you got to figure this thing out. Mama farinpour already tipped her hand. Whether she finds that kid's body or not, we're dead. If we stay in this box, we're dead. - All right. - You're-- right. Okay, uh... Now listen, when you get to shore, if you don't see me - in, uh, 20 minutes... - Uh-huh. ...then I want you to get to a telephone, call the cops and tell them everything you know. - All right. - Okay? I'm going to let you down in the water. There's a rail down there. Get your feet on it. Okay. No, wait a minute. You gotta go in feet first or you're gonna come out wrong. Oh, okay. No no, that's not gonna work. Uh, turn around. Uh, excuse me. [ Grunts ] Okay. - Okay. - There. Hang on, sister. Okay, get your feet on the rail. Don't let go now. Hang on. - Okay. - I got you. Not yet. Let me get you out there a little further. [ Grunts ] Dancer's voice: I was frightened for her, out there in that ocean all by herself. I would have given anything to be there with her, but I had my own war to fight. Something inside told me if there was one woman in the world I could count on, it was her. That beach was out there someplace and she'd get to it. I figured to make a move on that lock, to Jimmy it open. But any dummy knew there had to be a gorilla waiting just on the other side. I had to catch him by surprise. If that door didn't give, the ballgame was over. Man: He's out! Dancer's voice: Nobody reached for a gun. The two at the back looked like the easiest Mark. I kicked my way loose and just when I had it made, somebody whacked me and the lights went out. Mr. Dancer! Where are you? Come up. Come on up! Please don't take him. He's a good man. I know he is. Oh, god, please don't. Oh, god, please don't. Oh, god. Thank you. Oh, god, thank you so much. Thank god. Don't thank god, sister. Thank that water for not being too cold and these old bones for holding out. You must be freezing. You must be exhausted, Mr. Dancer. Sister, after all we've been through, I don't think the man upstairs would mind if you called me Joe. Okay, Joe. [ Machinery humming ] [ Train horn blaring ] Man: Hey, there's more than 50 cars out here, man. It's gonna take US all night. Well, you'd better get started. You take those over there and I'll take these. Dancer's voice: I had one ace on those two henchmen-- I had held back on 'em. I knew the number of the car. Hello, kid. I thought back to Sara, the girl who had sold David the necklace and what she told me about him buying two of them. I knew where the missing necklace was. It was soldered to the back of the one he was wearing. [ Banging ] [ Train horn blaring ] The key around David's neck was to a post office box. I remembered a million light years ago when I came up here looking for him, and a nice old lady in the post office who said she didn't know him. It was the size of a Gideon Bible but that's not what it was. It was a videotape. I had a whole collection of them, but mine were bogart films. Uh, my name is David farinpour and the fact that you are playing this videotape is evidence of my death and that the farinpour black widow syndrome of devouring their own remains intact. Now I never intended for this tape to be discovered while I was alive. And now that I am dead my only hope is that this tape is given to the authorities before my family destroys it. Um, the foundation of the farinpour fortune was framed in the mid-'30s. My father, Jacob farinpour, and his brother Jonathan began a salvage company. By early 1938 they had become the main suppliers for a German company which converted scrap metal into weaponry. By late 1938 the echoes of war had surfaced across and throughout Europe. My uncle Jonathan insisted the shipment cease. My mother insisted the shipments continue. My uncle Jonathan died. He died a mysterious unsolved death. The shipments continued. They continued to supply parts for Nazi Germany, for Nazi weapons, and the farinpours grew rich. Now I've documented these facts for you in the hope that someday someone somewhere will be able to use the farinpour name with some sense of dignity. So who do I collar? Councilman jerrold farinpour-- accessory before the fact, murder one, Wally haskell. Ditto, a guy named trotter, works for him. If you squeeze trotter he'll cop a plea. Eliza farinpour-- also accessory to Wally haskell's murder. I got a witness. You can talk to her later. Two cold fish in a freight yard out in cudahy-- kidnapping and the same murder. Which one of them killed the kid? I don't know yet. Do you mean it's personal? Yeah, Jake. It's personal. Dancer's voice: Jacqualone was right-- from here on in it was personal between me and David farinpour. Hi, kid. Can you come on over here right away? I got something for you. Okey-doke. Hi, boss. I was worried about you. There's nothing to worry about. I got something for you. It's a videotape your brother made. It's all about your family, how they made their fortune, what they're really like. It's not very pretty. I know why your brother left the family and why he wanted you to go with him. I should have left when he left. Yeah. You go home now. I gotta sleep. Joe, I wanna stay. No. We'll see each other tomorrow. Please. Tiffany, there's nothing in the world I'd rather do than be here with you tonight, but you have to go home. - Please let me stay. - Shh. Take the tape, you look at it and be with your brother. We'll see each other tomorrow. Will you call me in the morning? Yeah, sure. I'll call you. First thing? First thing. Dancer's voice: It was time to settle old business. This one was for David and it was personal. I slipped down the back way and watched while he turned his ugly head to check my place. He checked his gun and came after me, just the way he came after David. Only this time I was waiting for him. [ Gunshot ] Congratulations. You finally shot the right man. - [ Door opens and closes ] - Man: Tiffany? Darling, you got it? He gave it to you, didn't he? Yeah, he gave it to me. Oh, baby, if half of what you think is on that tape I'm going to be governor and you're going to be the first lady of California. It's over there. Hey, what's the matter? Come on, this is our ticket. This is a ticket to all of our dreams. My mother told me it could destroy all the farinpours. She didn't know how right she was. Dancer's voice: Tiffany, I know you won't be disappointed. David's tape is on its way to the people, which is what he wanted and what you wanted, but for different reasons. He wanted it to clear his conscience and the farinpour name. You wanted it for your own game. You hired me to find David so that your hired gunsel could kill him. We both did our job, didn't we? But your mother spoiled things for you. You didn't know that she had a bird dog out there watching David. Yeah, when trotter started shooting at me that blew the whole thing wide open. If trotter hadn't been there I would have turned the kid's body over, the tape would have surfaced and your brother the councilman would have been ruined. And you and your boyfriend would have waltzed into the governor's mansion. It took me a long time to put all the pieces together. From that first night out there on the-- - where are you going? - Going? Away from you. It's a bluff. I always thought I knew where I was going until now. I guess I was wrong. I guess I'm going to them before they come to me. That's a good idea. Maybe you can make a deal. Joe, you don't have any proof against US. I don't, huh? You made your first mistake when you had your freak with the earring, who killed David at 1000 yards, miss her at 50. I don't know which one of you planned what. That was supposed to throw me off the trail, but it didn't. It threw me on. And then you really overplayed your hand when you had him try to kill me. Joe, I didn't tell him to kill you. Maybe you didn't. All that kid ever wanted was to be left alone. That tape was his hedge to keep the family off his back. He didn't know who his real enemy was. He didn't know his sister. You talk about your mother. You're the same as she is. You wanted all the same stuff. You wanted the power and the money and to be the governor's wife. You know what the real world is like. You think the farinpours are any different than the rest of them? This is what it's like in the big league. I guess I hoped you could be part of it. Baby, where you're going, there's only room for one. It's a friend of mine from homicide. This is commissioner wilke. Right this way, commissioner. You know, some of what you said is true. I don't know if it makes any difference now. I didn't know they were going to kill David. And I never thought it would go this far. Tiffany, it went this far that night on the beach when you hired me to find your brother. - Joe? - Yeah. Do me a favor, will you? If I can. Always fish with your back to the ocean. Yeah, sure. Dancer's voice: For the next couple of days the booze didn't work. And I knew it wouldn't work for a long time. Nothing would go away, not David, not my dear old friend Wally, and most of all not her. It hurt because something did happen to US on the beach. It hurt because I knew Tiffany was right. Life isn't like the old movies I used to see. The bad guys in the black hats don't always lose and the good guys in the white hats don't always win. There are no more good guys and no more bad guys. It's all one store. But I did have the Ferris wheel. And maybe some of sister Clara's little whippers would turn out okay. [ Carnival music playing ]
