London. 20 years of blank factual. You wake up one morning and you know you're washed up. You keep going through the motions, though it means nothing. You've lost your tenderness. Your love of people. Hope you lost long ago. All you have left is your work, and work turns out to be nothing but a job. Pays the rent. Pays the booze. Keeps you off the street. SNOOKER BALLS CLATTER Solidarity's not enough. Never was. You realise you are granted one great comfort. Every day is one day less. But even then, you still think you've got a choice, and you're tempted. So, for once, you want to give more. PHONE RINGS RINGING CONTINUES DOOR OPENS Yes? MAN ON PHONE: Guess who this is. It's been a long time. Oh, fuck! DRINK POURS PHONE RINGS MAN ON PHONE: Same old temper. Berlin '68. Nothing? Even you can't have been drinking that much. HE SPEAKS IN GERMAN MAN ON PHONE: Speak English. Don't mention my name. Go to an international payphone. Railway station is best. Take down this number. 312580. - Have you got that? - 312580. - MAN ON PHONE: Ask for Manfred. - Manfred? Ist Manfred da? MANFRED: You'd be surprised how I followed your career, David. I even read all your art criticism in those glossy magazines. I really had expected bright things from you. Your words are the words I remember best from '68. It was you who taught me that if Germany did not deal with its Nazi past, did not settle the accounts left open since 1945, then all other political talk was bullshit. And you had no fear of violence. If violence was the only way to deal with fascism, then violence there would be. DAVID: What does it matter what I thought in '68? MANFRED: What matters is that you were right. Absolutely right. DAVID: Right? Wrong. What do you want? MANFRED: We have a comrade from Chile here. She and her husband taught at the university and opposed the junta. They were caught. The man was tortured to death. She was allowed to leave. The doctor of the secret police in charge of the torture is attending an international congress in London in three weeks' time. We want to set an example to all fascists. We want him to pay for what he did. We do not want him to return. We want him dead. Why tell me? MANFRED: Because you are the ideal choice. Are you crazy? I mean, why me? Because of something I said 20 years ago? MANFRED: Because of what you said and because you meant what you said. You were not playing, like so many others. Or were you? David? There is no connection between you and this torturer. No connection. No motive. No threats. You must know that things will happen in Chile like they happened in Argentina. All torturers will be sent home with a nice pension. Just like it was here. Just like it always will be. Look at the file. Call me Friday, nine o'clock. Sharp. CALL ENDS CLATTERING OUTSIDE For once, you want to give more, but you haven't even got that... ..because there isn't a lot to give. So you arrive at the big gesture. Of course, there is no such thing. So... ..there. Could you retype it and then fax it? - Yeah. - Yeah? Here are the illustrations to go with it. It's a review of the Henry Moore exhibition... Oh, before I forget. This came for you. Who left this? It was delivered by taxi first thing. I like your piece. Very persuasive, all this rhetoric of postmodernism. There's nothing wrong with rhetoric. Well, I suppose the problem's with the art, rather than with your piece. I can't get into it. Can't get involved the way I used to and I don't like being persuaded that I ought to. So why show the art, then? Public spaces are here to supply information. The most interesting, the most talked-about artists are doing this or that, and the public have a right to see it. - I don't have to like it. - You just end up showcasing - for the big galleries. - It was better in the old days. '68 and all that. When Joseph Beuys was going to save the world! - It's fine to provoke me. - Now we know better. Now we're all disillusioned. If it's all hype now, why wasn't it all hype 20 years ago? So, when do I get paid? Oh, that? Talk to Daphne. Don't forget your VAT number. - Seriously, David... - Hm? I'm surprised to hear you talking like this. Well, let's put it down to age, shall we? How about you buying me a drink? (SNIGGERS) All right! How careless of us... DISTANT CHATTER DISTANT LAUGHTER PHONE RINGS Hello? WOMAN: Hello, David? It's Catherine. - Hi. - How are you? Look, it's terribly short notice, but could you have dinner with me tonight? Charles is in Zurich. It'd be really nice to see you. Well, I'd love to have dinner with you. Great. There's a new place in Smithsfield. I'm not quite sure how... We'll find it. Still no car? Still no car. It's too dangerous. Dangerous? What are you talking about? Well, I might kill someone. All right, then, I'll pick you up around eight. FILM NARRATOR: I think we must not count on Dr Gachet at all. Firstly, he's sicker than I am. I think. Or shall we say just as much? Now, when a blind man leads another blind man, then they both fall into the ditch. It is difficult to know oneself. DOORBELL BUZZES But it isn't easy either to paint oneself. I should like to have a soul less unquiet than mine. Which is foundering. DOOR SHUTS CATHERINE: Hey. What's happened? It looks so different. Have you been decorating? TV OFF No, not really. I, uh, removed a couple of things, that's all. Looks good. DAVID: Hm. CATHERINE: That one. You like it? Gruetzke? Yeah. SHE INHALES DEEPLY I don't. So... Who's putting up with you these days? Nobody, really. I sort of solved it - I never overstay my welcome. You mean you don't any longer get involved. Oh, no, I get involved, but from a distance. - And that works? - More or less. The fucking gets harder, though. Mm! How's the drinking? Good. The drinking is good. David, be serious! You're not getting any younger. How much longer do you think you can go on like this? You turn away from people. You're never firm. All you do is drink. I do my work. Yes. Why are you so desperate? If I knew that, my sweet Catherine, I would possibly drink less. Or then again, possibly wouldn't. CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE You know what Tolstoy says? La vie est une terrine de merde don't il faut manger. David! It's my favourite quote! Oh, thank you, thank you. Practical man, Tolstoy. Where are you on your novel? - What, my book? - Mm-hm. Oh... Haven't done much with it for ages. I lacked a peace of mind to work on it. It took me days even to get into the mood to think about it. I really can't believe you get much satisfaction out of being pretty. Only to write about other people's work. Always to know better. Never to risk anything yourself. Beats working in an abattoir. You have something to say. Not many people do. How long would you need? Why... At least half a year away from it all. Even longer. But I agree, I... I do hope to write it one day. We have a house in Tuscany, near Siena. We hardly ever go there. Charles finds it too primitive. He hates the Italian food. All that pasta. You go there. And write. Nobody would disturb you. You must. It's silly to throw a chance like this away. I mean, I-I can't just drop everything and go to Italy! Yes, you can. We have a young relative who's coming over from Australia to do his PhD at Imperial College. Sasha could use your flat. We'll pay the bills, give you extra money for the flat, enough for you to live on in Italy. And it'd be much nicer for Sasha to have somewhere of his own here.

DAVID: That's fine, in an hour, thanks. - Ciao. - Ciao. Good luck with your novel. What's it called? Oh... I hope you're still here when I get back. I don't know, I'm trying to get a job in the New York office, but they're giving me a hard time with the green card. London is such a bore, don't you agree? Quite. I like that. When I'm in New York, you must come and see me. Good luck with the green card. - There's always marriage. - Yeah, thanks. DOOR CLOSES MAN ON PHONE: Is that you? Yes. I'll write that Beckmann expertise. MAN: Beckmann expertise? Excellent. Who knows about it? MAN: Only the lady who owns the painting and myself. The owner will bring you all the information with the best photographs we have. I don't even keep a file on this sort of action. You'll have all the materials on Monday. How? MAN: You'll see. You'll have it. Just you and her? Who'll draw up the first description? MAN: The owner. It is as an important for me as it is for you that nobody knows anything about this. You must see that?

Tell you what, why don't you meet me in half an hour at the food halls, flower department? Then you can drive back with me, keep me company while I cook. That's good, as long as I don't get entangled with the bank. CATHERINE: Don't be such a baby. You're more than a match for any of them. What a horrible idea. See you in half an hour. DISTANT CHATTER - Oh! - David. So, how may people are you going to have for dinner? Ten. Company boys, bankers. - Boring stuff. - Well... Yes, hello. I'd like a fillet of the best Angus. - Enough for ten. - Certainly, madam. Right away. How about this one? Mm, no. How about that one there? You prefer this one? The biggest we have! CATHERINE: Perfect. To your decision. To my decision. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH Champagne? Celebrations? What's going on? Hello, Rachel. David has finally decided to finish his novel at the house in Tuscany, and I believe that I have been instrumental in helping him make up his mind. DRINK POURS Are you hungry? Get him something from the fridge. I'll get some bread. What's your book about? It's about the collapse of all human standards - art, politics, morals. In short, about decadence. Triste, solitario y final. Triste, solitario y final? Sad and lonely and final. I'd better get back. I'll try for a taxi in the street. You'll never get a cab at this hour. I'll take you. Can I take your car? CATHERINE: Sure. Here. - Mum's very fond of you. - I know. Do you mind if I ask you a question? - About Catherine and me? - No! I know about that. Catherine told you? No. It's obvious. It is? Yes! What do you think of political violence? Why? Well, I'm in this group. We're against animal tests, vivisection, sort of Animal Liberation Front. But you wear leather shoes. You eat meat. I do not. I'm a vegetarian. But I do admit I wear leather shoes. But you must agree that what happens in those labs is far worse than any slaughterhouse. Yes, but the result is the same, isn't it? I'm...I'm sure you're right. We've had protests, denounced products, that sort of thing. Mm-hm. But some of feel now we should go a step further. Like what? Well, like raiding the labs and destroying the equipment and freeing the animals. Yeah. We used to call that violence against property. It was generally thought of as acceptable. So you think it's OK? Yeah. It must look tempting, immediate results. Famous direct action. Direct action doesn't work. Why not? Because it invariably achieves the opposite of what it sets out to do. Could you pull up there, please? I'd like to walk the rest. Hello, David! TRANSLATION: - DAVID: Ah. - Ja. God protect us... TRAFFIC DROWNS OUT WORDS PHONE RINGS - Hello. - WOMAN: David Keller? Yes. WOMAN: This is Sarah Yelin. Hello. Where are you? SARAH: I am in London. Can I see you? Right. Meet me in an hour at... ..at the Serpentine Gallery. Take a taxi to Albert Hall. Opposite, you see this...Albert Memorial. Behind it is a small grey building. That's the Serpentine Gallery. Go inside, and I'll approach you. What...what will you be wearing? SARAH: A red coat. DOOR CLOSES FOOTSTEPS SOFTLY: Sarah Yelin? DOOR CLOSES SARAH: Can you prove to me that you are the person that was talked about? You heard from Manfred? When did he call you? He didn't. He was here. Yesterday afternoon. He was here? So he decided... ..it is really off, then? That's what I thought. What did he say about me? As you were politically responsible, you would come around. He was just using me. He was planning it all along. I became a decoy. He played me along because he needed my contacts, my first-hand information. I realised it too late. He certainly has a sound grasp of tactics. He never intended to go through with it? No. When we met and I confided in him, I'm sure he genuinely wanted to help me. But it game him the idea to approach Vargas. Vargas left Chile some time ago. He prepared for the change. Vargas wants to be a survivor. He only made one mistake in his life. He became a torturer. He will do anything to erase that. Manfred must have seen like a gift from the gods to him. Manfred knows no humanity. He is a fanatic. Now, Vargas, who killed my husband and tortured me, is going to get the chance to whitewash himself. Still, so far, I understand what's going on. With one exception. I don't understand you. Manfred says go, you go. Manfred says don't go, you stop. What are you, a machine? I am... I am fucked. Because you are prepared to help... ..then you pull back. I cannot comprehend that. I counted on you as a friend. Well, this is not to do with friendship. I have reasons of my own. Now I'm told what I was supposed to do will do more harm than good. So I agree. I don't like it, but I agree. This way, he has a point. This way, the whole world will learn what the Americans have been doing and are still doing. The media will jump at it. It's not just testimony from the victims and the families but proof from the inside. It will have repercussions in America. They might even withdraw their support. Withdraw their support? Do you know what they did to him? Do you want to know? They carried me there. They forced me to watch. They destroyed him systematically. In the end, there wasn't a person any more. Just a... That was how I saw Berto last. That was where I saw Vargas last. And that was where I lost our child. He could have saved him but he let me abort. He thought it was funny. Can you understand that? No, you can't. I know you cannot understand what happened to Berto and me. You dare to talk about... ..political responsibilities with me? Are you mad? Are all you Europeans mad? I wanted to do it myself. It doesn't take much strength to pull the trigger of a pistol. But I know I can't. Faced with Vargas... ..I would just freeze. Just thinking of him terrorises me. Please... ..help me. Please do it. I'll try. Who knows about me? Just Manfred, and I am pretty sure about that. How did you find him? He found me. Where does he work? 26 Ballindamm. He is a partner in the law firm Wegener, von Gerlach und Lang. Uh-huh. Does he know you're here? It would be better if you did not return to Hamburg. What passport are you travelling on? - Italian. - Good. Do you have anybody you can stay with? I have relatives in Florence. My mother's family moved there after the war. Very good. Go there. Don't go back to Hamburg. Leave London tonight. Take the boat train to Paris. No reservations. Take second class. In Paris, take another train to Florence. Again, no sleeper. No reservations. Try to get to Florence without attracting attention. In Paris, drop a little note to Manfred saying you will spend a couple of days there and that you will be in touch. Can you do that? It's all right. I have done similar routines. I shall destroy your name and telephone number. Nothing will connect us. Nothing visible. Can I please have Berto's picture back? Does he know you have relatives in Florence? No, he does not. If you need to contact me... ..the number is... ..216086. 216086. 216086. How will I know? It'll make the papers. Look after yourself.

TV: The Greek cabinet is to hold an emergency meeting on terrorism following the murder of a state prosecutor. Rebel forces in El Salvador have, for the first time in nine years of civil war, offered to take part in elections. They want the presidential elections postponed until September, and a promise to stop any military action while the polling goes ahead. A correspondent for the BBC in San Salvador says the offer marks a bold change in strategy by the guerrillas, who in the past have described elections as a farce imposed by the United States.
