(BLEEPING) (RAPID BEEPING) Shit. (CAT YOWLS) GRIFF: Night mode. (KEYS JINGLING) (GRUNTING) Get out of my neighborhood. WOMAN:...outside my flat. Hello, I need to speak to the police, please. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (PHONE RINGING) Shipping, Griff speaking. - (GASPS) - Whoa! (LAUGHS) Griff. There you go. How was lunch? Sorry. Sorry. - What did you have? - A sandwich. What was in the sandwich? Cheese. Egg. Mayonnaise. I love mayonnaise. Was it whole egg? Yeah, I think so. I don't know. That's for Gary. Tax time. He wants them sorted into categories, dates, and then added up. I know. Sorry. Short straw. (GASPS) Hey, hey, hey. Don't fight it, Griff. I just want to... Stop it! (MOCKING) Just stop it! Griff. How'd you go? - All done. - Great. Just... They weren't really for Gary, were they? No. (CAR ALARM BLARING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) Stay out of my neighborhood. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) It's OK. You're safe. Go away. I've got mace! It's OK, you're safe. You're safe now. Never fear. Griff the Protector is here. No. Griff the Hidden. (DOORBELL BUZZING) (SOFT JAZZ RECORD PLAYING) - Who is it? - It's Tim, Griff. TIM: For a minute, I thought it was you. It better not be, Griff, because I moved back here for you and you'd promised me that you'd stopped. No, it's not. I promise. - It better not be. - It's not. Better not be. How's work, anyway? - It's really good. - Good. - It's good you have that job. - Yep. - Keeps you out of trouble. - It does. Good. Well. Oh, you know how before I said I was in the neighborhood? Well, the reason is because I was on a date. Her name is Melody. Melody. Like music. Yes, it is like... It's like music. Anyway, I think she could be it. (GRUNTS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Melee? Are you back already? Mmm-hmm. - Did you bump your head again? Clumsy. - Mmm-hmm. So, how was the date? He is adorable. - Yeah, he's lovely. - Oh, he is very right for you, Mel. Well done. Tim and Melody. Mel... OK, Mum, look, we've been on one date, OK? I'm just figuring out if I like him. Have there been any, you know, - intimacies? - Goodnight, Mum. Goodnight, darling. (SIREN BLARING) Sorry, Tim. I made a promise. To rid this city of evil, in the name of justice. It's not a choice. It's a responsibility. (TROUBLE IS A FRIEND PLAYING) ♪ Trouble, he will find you ♪ No matter where you go ♪ Oh, oh ♪ No matter if you're fast No matter if you're slow No problem, sir.

Don't enjoy it too much. It's still work. (PHONE RINGING) Shipping, Griff speaking. It's Tony. Hi, Tony. Just wondering what you're doing for lunch. - Why? - I'm going to this little Chinese restaurant and they do great pork balls. I know that you love balls. - No, thanks. - Hey, here it is. I really, really like you. A lot. And I love balls, too. Two ball lovers... State championships. I got three perfect tens. But even then, Heather Twinkletoes won. Well, you look like a champ to me. TIM: We met at a Chinese restaurant. I was paying for the bill for my table, and it was $19, and we'd all had a banquet. $19! What? - Oh, dear. - And I said to myself... - Thanks. - ..."That's pretty good value!" Melody! Oh, it's not so bad. (TIM CHUCKLES) I'm OK. TIM: So, anyway, so I look over at Melody sitting by herself, and she was looking at her bill. How much was it, Mel? Mel? $218! BRONWYN: Why were you eating alone, Melody? She does funny things. She's fine, though. (PHONE RINGING) Yes, sir. There definitely seems to be more activity in recent weeks. COMMISSIONER: Well, the press are calling it a crime wave. What do you think? - A crime wave? I'm not sure, sir. - Well, you've got to do something. (DOORBELL BUZZING) We're running out of men. - Yes, Commissioner. - So you say you'll help? - Yes sir, I will. - Thank you, Griff. Can't do it without you. Thank you, sir. (DOORBELL BUZZING) (SOFT JAZZ RECORD PLAYING) - Who is it? - It's Tim, Griff. Who else? GRIFF: No, no, no. Griff, this is Melody. - Hello. - My new girlfriend. - I didn't say that would be OK, Tim. - No, I know, but... I'm sorry. She really wanted to meet you. Wants to meet you, don't you? - Should we go? - No, no, no. (FOOTSTEPS) (CLATTERING) GRIFF: OK. I thought I'd bring Melody over, so you could actually meet her instead of me just talking about her all the time. I got Griff his new job, through a friend. Platonic. Female, platonic friend. Yeah, got bullied at the last job, didn't you? Just like at school. Always bullied at school. Lucky I was there. Won't happen anymore, though. Right, Griff? Is that your cat downstairs, Griff? I don't have time for a cat. Or a dog. You know they reckon cats can see spirits? - Did you know that? - I don't think they're spirits. I don't think that ghosts exist. I think they are real people, but in parallel places and... And maybe there are nine parallel universes and cats live in all of them at once. That's why they can see everyone, but we only live in one at a time, and then, when we die, we branch off into this other parallel existence where we didn't die, and meanwhile, where we did die everyone is sad and going, Oh, no, she died. From, you know, whatever happened to you, accident, or cancer. So they're here now? I don't think so. - What's under the sheet, Griff? - It's just a mannequin, I think, babe. Oh. Oh! TIM: Are you OK, hon? - You OK? - It's OK. We're good. Didn't hurt yourself? - No, I'm fine. - Oh, good. Stupid chair. Anyhoo, we'd better go. Hey, we should all have dinner next week. Get you out of the house. Shame Melody doesn't have a sister. Do you have a sister? No. BOY: Sorry. Sorry. (UNDONE PLAYING) Short stuff. TONY: Oh, there he is. Gary, Griff's here. Call off the search party, everyone. Where've you been? We've been worried sick. (SCREAMING) (ALL CHEERING) Sorry, Gary. Hi, Griff. How's your brother? - Same. - That's good. Has he got a girlfriend? Yep. Ah. - Griff. Can you pop in for a word? - Hmm? Do you want to tell me what's going on? - It's nothing, Gary. Sorry. - Doesn't look like nothing. Are you on drugs? What? No! Girl trouble? Do you owe someone money? No, it's nothing like that, Gary. Sorry. What happened, Griff? You started out so strong. - I know. - You've dropped the ball. - Have you dropped the ball? - No, I haven't. Want to know what I think? You're making yourself a target. I think you're making yourself more visible when you should be trying to be invisible. How? How do you mean? Well, Griff, I see how people look at you. And, well, this is hard to say, but when you hide and you don't interact, well, you come across a bit odd. - Invisible. - People notice you even more, ironically. You've got to chat to people, like I do. I mean, I'm a bit odd, too, but I just go around. I'm chatting to people all the time. And the amazing thing is, after a while of acting normal, you become normal. It's like an accent. I mean, if I was to start talking in an American accent all the time, I'd become an American, right? Just don't give that goose fuel. The only way to make him back off is to beat him at his own game. Act normally. Then you can get on with becoming the best client liaison we've got. And you could be. Yes? Invisible Man. Hello, Griff. Doing some painting? Of course. Sorry. So, that it? Do you know anything about invisible ink? No, no. Oh, yeah. I think you can use baking soda, though. Do you have any? (WHISTLING) Put it on the tab. Can I have that receipt, please? You didn't see me. - This is nice, Mel. What is it? - Shark. Flake. Which is shark. So, Tim, Melody tells me you have a brother. - Griff, that's right. - Griff. I know a Griff. Comes into the shop. - Came in today, actually. Odd chap. - Darling. - That's probably him. - Always leave with, "You didn't see me." That's definitely him. Hope he's no trouble. BENSON: No, no, not at all. Is he older or younger? Younger. In every sense. Actually, he's the reason Melody and I met. Well, indirectly, I suppose. I was living in Adelaide and I had to come back because Griff lost his job and was in need of a big brother again, so I got a transfer. And now he's OK again. And then I went to that Chinese restaurant. (LAUGHS) And we know what happened there. You're not going back to Adelaide, are you? Maybe. We'll see. You'd want to stay here though if, say, you and Melody got married. (COUGHS) Who knows? Yeah. Melody! Did you know 40% of people don't believe statistics when they read them? No. No, I didn't. So that means that 40% of responses should be ignored, because the people giving them, they don't believe them anyway, so they can't be trusted. Don't know. Well. - Thanks for another lovely evening. - Thanks, Tim. You're really lovely. Right-ee-oh. (CAR DOOR OPENS) Hey, Melody. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) $218? What?

What are you doing? I'm at home. - Are you OK? - Yeah. - Is Tim with you? - No. Maybe I should come in or something. Well, I'm kind of in the middle of some things. And sleeping. Sorry. Sorry. I was just, you know, in the neighborhood. But I'll go. Do you want some water before you leave? Here you go. Isn't that funny to think that I just poured hydrogen and oxygen into this hole in my face, and now it's merging with all the other atoms in my body to become part of me? That is, until my body decides to use it to flush out toxic waste. Can I use your toilet? No. Well, hang on. Oh. Um... - It's just through there. - Thanks. (DOOR CLOSES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) So, I should go. Yeah. - Thanks for the water. - It's all right. It's just tap water, so... I just wanted to say that I think you're really nice. - Not nice, but... - OK. Bye.

And so he doesn't want to, or he... He doesn't want me to hurt you. Sorry. Sorry, what? Sorry? Tim, I think you'll be really good to go out with. Right. With someone who is right. Right. But I'm... - Not. - Not. - Not right, no. - Right. So... Hang on. So, Griff, what is he... You and Griff? Yeah, I think so. He's... He's like me. I don't need to know details. I'm fine. That's good. I'm glad. Really glad. Why did you run? Did you think we were there to arrest you? What have you done that warrants arrest? We've had reports of someone stalking residents in your neighborhood. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? Stalking is an offense, Griff. As is prowling and voyeurism. Were we to inspect your home, do you think we'd find anything that might incriminate you? You've... You've got the wrong man, sir. OK? I've seen what you're looking for, I have, and it's out there. And, well, no one's doing anything about it, so... Taking the law into your own hands is also an offense, Griff. Is that what you are? A vigilante? No, I'm not a vigilante. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Come! Chief says, "Let it go." Right, Griff. Having seen you, we've decided not to press charges. Lucky for you. Lucky I'm in a good mood. I don't want to hear any more reports of stalking, understood? I'll do my best to help, Commissioner. Don't push me, freak. I've had it, Griff. I'm going back to Adelaide. You need help. Professional. Oh. Griff. Did Tony do that to you, Griff? Griff.

Look, I don't know what it is, but it is marked "Top Secret." Top Secret? Yeah. - You didn't see who brought it? - No. Be careful. I think there's a note.

Do you read, over? How is it real? He's a Custom Liaison Officer who thinks he's an invisible superhero. (CLATTERING) If you want to be his friend, or more, or whatever, then you need to help him to stop, not tell him it's real. He's not hurting anyone. He may even be saving them. Who? Invisible people? Yes, maybe. (ALL GRUNTING) OK, so in the real world, where the rest of us live, what do you do with a boyfriend who's a superhero?

He's not coming over to dinner, Tim. I would never ask him over because he's Griff, and he needs to grow up. He would not fit in with them or anyone else in the real world because he's a freak. (STATIC) And so am I, and that is exactly why I love him. (STATIC) (MELODY'S VOICE BREAKING UP) We see the world one way, and you see it this other way, and because you don't understand, you want to change it, but I don't want to change it.

In the middle. Inevitable. (LAUGHTER) Hi. Where've you been? When? Oh, yeah, a bit busy. Just had some stuff to... I had to fix some things. Sorry. Well, yum yum, chook's bum. GRIFF: Thank you, sir. No. Benson, please. Griff just got a new job, darl. Oh, what is it? I'm a customer liaisons officer at DHL Transport. I'm not really sure what that is. (ALL LAUGHING) Melody and I, we met through Tim. And Tim and Melody met at a Chinese restaurant. And now Tim and I are taking cooking classes, and guess what we cooked last week? Sweet and sour pork. Mmm. Which is Chinese. It's so funny. BRONWYN: Well, that's a good idea. Cooking classes for men. Oh, whoever's responsible for this meal is in no need of cooking classes. I don't... I don't know about that. I... I must have the recipe. BRONWYN: Of course. I've always had a flair with food. Are you sure you won't stay? I should get back. Early start at the office. But... But thank you. I had a lovely evening. Well, we'll let you two say goodbye. Goodnight. Well, goodnight, my love. He's nice. Griff. Griff, open up! - What's happening? - What's happening? What's happening? Let me see. I can't do this. - Do what? - This. Us. I cannot do this us, Griff. Wait, you're ending it, already? - But I thought this was... - Griff, please. You're either punishing me, laughing at me, or you were seriously convinced that this is what I want. No, I don't understand, Melody. What about the missions? What... What about your duty to defend the innocent and uphold... It's not real, Melody. I'm not a superhero. Yes... Yes, you are. What do you miss? Did you enjoy laughing at me? Was I a dancing monkey, or something? It's not real, Melody. This is real. - No! - Yeah. - Everything you see here is real. - No! - This pantry... - Griff, please don't do this. Is real. - Rice. Real. - You were real. - Griff! - Real! Stop it. Listen, Griff. I live in a bubble that no one, no one gets into. I feel like an alien. I... I live in a completely different world to the one everyone else is in. I can't communicate with anyone. I can talk to them, but I cannot communicate. But you, Griff, you get into my bubble. Everybody has to grow up. No, they don't. I would have loved you. Forever. (CRYING) (CRYING) Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. OK. - You just... - You just went through a door. Sorry. - Yeah. How did you... How did you... You just... (EXCLAIMS) I can't believe it. You can. You can believe it. Yeah. MELODY: What is it? It's a package. For you. What were you doing? I can't say. I'm going to put the suit on. There's probably a note with it. Use these to be the only one who can see Griff when he's invisible. So he doesn't have to wear the hat. - Tell me when you're in it. - I'm in it. Does it work? Can you see me? Yeah. Yeah, I can see you. I can see you.
