Suat died in an accident, Nazire. You know that, too. He didn't die in an accident. He drove the car towards the dam. He killed himself. Don't do this, Nazire. He is coming to my dreams every night. He is telling me. He says, "I died because of my father". We'll entrust ourselves to God. Why doesn't your bride talk to you? They told me about that, too. Because, she is afraid of you. She is afraid you will infect her with darkness at the mountain. Your grandchild is suffering, Burhan. After her father died, she doesn't want to live. Your punishment is inflicted on your bloodline. You are bringing an end to your bloodline slowly. Don't you miss Suat, Burhan? Don't you miss Suat, Burhan? Don't you miss Suat, Burhan? I am going to my room. I have things to do. Don't you miss Suat, Burhan? Don't you miss Suat, Burhan? Don't you miss Suat, Burhan? Don't you miss Suat, Burhan? Ece, Dad, come on in. Dinner is ready. Alright, we'll be there in a minute.

Open your eyes. Zehra! Open your eyes. Zehra! Ece? Ece, girl. Ece! Ece. Ece! I don't know what I am supposed to do! I have no purpose left. I don't know why I am still alive. Dear God. Brother. You lost your wife and daughter. You have no purpose to live for. You don't remember but you keep suffering bigger pains. You are afraid to see... ...what would happen to you if you kill yourself. Kill me, too, brother? We can die together. I have no one left but you in this life, Zehra. Help me keeping myself alive. Help me to survive. You killed them, brother. Your wife. Your daughter. You killed them. What are you saying? You killed them... ...and you turned me into this. You crippled me, brother. That night you came home... ...to your wife, you said,... ..."This child is not mine. I won't let you fool me any longer. You have no right to turn my life into hell." You stabbed her so many times. You didn't stop. You just didn't. Then you killed your daughter Hilal. I tried to save Hilal but you turned me into this. You crippled me. Remember that, brother? What are you saying, Zehra? What are you saying? Get your hands off me! You don't remember it because... ...you can't live with the calamity you caused. That's why you are forgetting everything. You have done something so evil,... ...even your mind doesn't let you remember. Your brain has been possessed! Why can't I die? Why can't I die? Why can't I die? You are having a nightmare. Wake up! Wake up! You were having a nightmare, Sabahat. I tried to wake you up but I couldn't. Bring my pills to me. Alright, sis. Tell Burhan that I am going to die. May God forbid, sis. Don't say that. Oh God. They are haunting his grandchild. Tell him not to do what he has in mind. Sabahat! Uncle. -What happened, girl? Sis. She..... Ece? Girl. I called your grandfather. He didn't answer. My dear girl. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them. You'll suffer. You'll suffer so much for what you did. Don't forget what I tell you, dad. Don't leave me alone. Look me in the eye. You'll suffer so much for what you did. Look me in the eye. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them! Brother? Brother? Brother. Do you remember, brother? You lost your wife and daughter, brother. You have no purpose to live for. You killed them, brother. You are the one who crippled me. Look! I tried to save Hilal but you crippled me, brother. You killed your wife and daughter. You killed them! Do you want to remember? Do you want to remember? See that room over there. Look! This child is not my daughter. You have no right to turn my life into hell! Don't do this! Stop! Don't Brother! Stop! Brother, don't do this. Don't do this! Dad, stop! Stop! Don't do this! -No! Don't do this! Stop! Don't! -Dad, stop! Dad, don't do this! -Brother! Stop! No! No! You have no right to turn my life into hell! No, no! Alright. Calm down. Calm down. It's alright. It's alright. You can do it. You will do it. It's alright. It's alright. You have no purpose to live for. Kill yourself. Be free! I saw..... They showed me. They showed me my wife and daughter. My Melek, My Hilal. I killed..... I killed them with my hands. Who am I? What kind of an entity am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who? Who am I? Who am I? Don't believe what they show you. Don't believe what they tell you. A human's mind is a dimension of games and tricks. You have no guilt. What I am about to tell you... ...if I told you about that some other time,... ...that would be pointless like trying to... ...add water to a container full of mercury. I don't want to make you say, "Should I believe my eyes or you?" And drive you into ignorance like the ignorant ones... ...who deny God's existence. I am afraid of losing you forever. But you'll hear them and understand them in such a time. You'll grasp them like a man who kneels before his enemy... ...but finds a stone for... ...his survival on the ground. A dark force trapped you. A dark force trapped you. It avenges for the harm you gave to its bloodline. It avenges for the harm you gave to its bloodline. You destroyed its family so it takes revenge. You destroyed its family so it takes revenge. It tricked you and it inflicts you pain from hell. It tricked you and it inflicts you pain from hell. You are not the old Araf. Your pain is fresh. It can fool you again. It can fool you again. This was your test, Araf. Don't let it fool you. Don't let it fool you. It will hide its name from you. If it makes you weak. Remember this moment. If it makes you weak. Remember this moment. That entity's name is..... Leave this body you foul creature. Or get outside this body you foul creature. Leave this body you foul creature. Or get outside this body you foul creature. Gather your strength and fight. Turn your back to the evil. Fight it. Close your doors for the evil. Turn your back to the evil. Find strength in Prophet's words. Gather your strength and remember that you are the Fire Executioner! If one doesn't know where to start,... ...he can't know how to finish. It wasn't you who didn't allow me to reach you. It was the entity in you and the darkness in you. An evil harbored your darkness... ...kept you away from you. It was you who allowed this evil to do that. My words I am about to utter will disturb the evil... ...but cause you pain. Once you feel that the pain is unbearable,... ...turn your back to the evil and find strength in Prophet's words. They are not your family. You have no wife. You have no daughter. You have never had and you will never have. They are not your family. If you had a wife and a daughter,... ...wouldn't you have even the smallest proof? You got this necklace for me. Remember me whenever you look at it. To possess you and to eliminate you, it made you weak. And to do this,... ...it gave you the biggest pain in the universe,... ...the pain of losing a child. The only thing it can do to eliminate you... ...was to make you kill yourself. Dad, look me in the eye. You'll suffer so much for what you did. Now, when you find out about the truth,... ...nothing may make you feel peaceful but you should know this. And be free of the poison inside you. A dark entity trapped you. It gave you a memory of merry times you have never had. Then it gave you the misery... ...of losing those you love who never existed. Such big pain and sadness. They don't have to be real or lies. You have experienced them. This pain and misery have been... ...carved into the cells of your mind. Now, you know that none of them was real but still,... ...that doesn't cleanse the pain away. You have experienced this feeling... ...and now it won't be possible to forget this. For how long have I been in this State? Since last night. Maybe this horrifying pain feels like it's been there for years,... ...but it's just been a couple of hours. I felt like I was in pain for years. It gave you hell. Because last night you made a big mistake. Like many times you did earlier,... ...you were there to help those two innocent bodies. But this was an entity you hadn't seen before. It possessed two bodies. The most wicked of all evils. It was paining both of them so severely. You don't have the right to make them suffer. Just release them. If you want them be free, you'll pick one of them. I don't know what your purpose is. Set them free. Release them. Let them be on their way. You have to choose one of them. Leave them be! Go back to your hell! Go back to your dark dungeon! Leave these bodies! Mom! My mother is dying. Save her! It made you believe. It put you in a dilemma to save which one. I took your power. You are weak now. I darkened your heart and got your power. Leave these bodies. Go back to your Hell! Leave these bodies alone! -Dad, look me in the eye. You'll suffer so much for what you did. Don't forget what I say, dad. Don't leave me alone. You'll suffer so much, dad. You'll suffer so much. You'll suffer so much. It took an advantage of a moment of weakness... ...and it possessed your body. Dad. You'll suffer for so much what you did. Don't forget. Don't forget what I say. You'll suffer for what you did. It set you a terrible step. Don't ever leave me, dad. You'll suffer so much for what you did. You'll suffer so much for what you did, dad. A mother and a daughter you didn't know. You went there to help and save them. It made you see them like your family. It dragged you into despair. Do you know the girl whose house you stayed at last night. She said she was my sister. Your sister died years ago. She is not your sister. She is just a poor, half-witted girl. She is just a beggar. It is a puppet of flesh. They played with your mind. I experienced that pain. It was real. It attacked you with all its evilness... ...to make you kill yourself. But the "you" in the dark part of your mind,... ...it stopped the evil in your brain. You are stronger with these pains now. They stopped me from reaching you. It had no power against me but... ...it threatened me with my family... ...with my wife and with my grandchild. It gave them pain and stopped me from reaching you. Rumor says, in ancient times,... ...those who destroyed the bloodline of the evil ones... ...and the demons were used to be called Fire Executioners. The cost of the divine power bestowed on them... ...which they pay is their tests. According to me, these have been your tests. If I hadn't been sure of this,... ...I wouldn't have let my family suffer so that I could save you. You have survived and that's the only explanation. Now you are the Fire Executioner. From this day on,... ...you can't be a slave of your feelings or emotions. It has no power on you. Go to it. Control your emotions and mind. Your pains are fresh. You know what you must do. You'll suffer more than you inflicted. I won't let you get away with this. You'll suffer more than you inflicted. I won't let you get away with this. Get out of this body! You have no right to cause pain to this body. You'll suffer more than you... ...inflicted upon me and the innocents! You cannot best me you desperate Mahlukat! Who are you? Where did you come from? I am talking to you! Who are you? Where did you come from? You can't give me orders, you desperate Mahlukat! Who are you? What's your name? Speak to me! Who are you? Where did you come from? Answer me! I came from Ur! I came from Babylon! I came from Nippur! Talk to me! What is your name. Where did you come from? I came from Bagdad! I came from Damascus! I came from Jerusalem! I came from Cairo! I came from Fire! I came from Hell! I came from disease! I came from curse! You evil entity! Tell me your name! My name is Hedliyac! My name is Haffur! My name is Habilah! My name is Hannas! My name is Teykel! My name is Mahluk! My name is Mahhar! My name is Şoğal! My name is Marid! My name is Azazel! My name is Vacca! Deccal! Iblis! Ezzih! Marah! Hablis! You can't beat me you desperate Mahluk! You can't beat me you desperate Mahluk! Dad? Look me in the eye. Don't leave me alone, dad. Don't say that! Don't speak like that. It will try to control you again. Your pain is still fresh. Look me in the eye. Don't leave me alone, dad. Don't let it fool you. Remember, dad. Don't believe what they show you. A human's mind is a dimension of games and tricks. Dad, don't believe in what they tell you. A human's mind is a dimension of games and tricks. Don't leave me alone. Remember, dad! It will hide its name from you. If it drags you into weakness. Remember. That's entity's name is..... Gather your strength and fight. Gather you strength and remember that you are the Fire Executioner! Go back to where the mighty God imprisoned you! Go back to where the mighty God imprisoned you! Go back to where the mighty God imprisoned you! Go back to where the mighty God imprisoned you! Good God. Thank you! I give you my gratitude. Good God! What you went through over a night,... ...it showed you how weak you are against a big evil. When you feel that the pain is unbearable,... ...turn yourself against the evil and remember Prophet's words. The calamities and maligns can be the penance of a test or a sin. Tests are not always done with a pen and a paper. Sometimes we are tested with pain, misery and suffering. Sometimes we are tested with a pleasure we cannot refuse. The misery you experienced and that found place in your brain,... ...it may make you become stronger and more resilient. You have passed this test. Now you are stronger. You are now the Fire Executioner. Surrender to the responsibilities of this title. Never forget, among the trappers,... ...God is the One with the best intentions. No living beings were harmed during the making of this movie.
