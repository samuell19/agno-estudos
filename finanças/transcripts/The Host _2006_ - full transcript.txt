I'll clean again. You don't have to clean up now. Why don't you dump this first? That's formalin. Formaldehyde, to be precise. To be even more precise, dirty formaldehyde. Every bottle is coated with layers of dust. Pour them into the sink. Excuse me? Just empty every bottle to the very last drop. It's just... they are toxic chemicals and the regulation states that... Pour them right down the drain, Mr. Kim. If I pour them in the drain, they'll run into the Han River. That's right. Let's just dump them in the Han River. But, you know, this is not just any toxic chemical... The Han River is very broad, Mr. Kim. Let's try to be broad-minded about this. Anyway, that's an order. So, start pouring. June 2002, Han River What the heck is this? What? That's pretty gross. Is it a mutation? Is it dead? No, it moved a second ago. Yeah? Wait... My cup! That was close. My daughter gave me this cup. Look, it's swimming away. How many tails does that thing have? You got me. Makes your skin crawl. - Mr. Yoon! - Sir! October 2006, Han River Bridge What the hell are you doing? Don't do it! No! No! Did you guys see that? Underneath... In the water! Something dark in the water... You really didn't see it? What the hell are you talking about? Morons, to the very end. Have a good life.

Three squids for mat #4, roast them quickly. Gosh, how much sleep can a body take? director BONG Joon-ho Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Here you are. Oh, that hurts. Did your uncle do a good job? He came, at least. I was worried. I was the only one whose uncle came to parents' day. That's why I kept calling, but you didn't answer. Why didn't you answer? You think this phone can receive signals? I'm too embarrassed to use it in public. You take it. What's wrong with it? Oh, and about uncle... I could smell alcohol on him when he stood in the back of class. That punk, getting drunk at this hour. Hasn't it started, Grandpa? What? Today's Nam-joo's competition, aren't we gonna watch? Oh, Nam-joo! Right... Why isn't it on? - You know what this is? - What? I'm saving up to get you a new phone. There's a lot, huh? They're all dimes! That'll never be enough. There are some quarters, too... What's this penny doing here? This is all from the change box, huh? I'll tell Grandpa. - Go ahead, tell the geezer. - Geezer? It's a dead body.

I received a complaint from mat #4. Their squid had only nine legs. Did you eat one? No... Don't deny it! Why touch other people's things? Think of it from the customer's perspective. A squid... The torso tastes delicious, but the legs. especially the longest one, has got something special, right? From a paying customer's perspective, it's important. Take this to mat #4. Tell them it's on the house. ...4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... Mat #4, - I've brought your order. - Oh, put it down there. What are you looking at? There's something there. Come on. - There, under the bridge. - See it? - Do you see it? - How long has it been there? - It's been a while. - I told you. Ah, it's construction equipment. - Something they hung...? - No. Don't think so. It's moving. Yeah, it just moved. Did it? Bullseye! She's amazing! I'm not just saying that because she's my daughter. How could she hit the exact center like that? Right! I can't believe it! Let's close the stand today. It's going in. It's huge God, it's huge Did you see that? He ate the can! - Maybe, it's a dolphin. - All in one gulp. Have some beer nuts too! It swam off. It's gone now. It's an Amazonian river dolphin for sure. This time there are ten legs. Mister. This time there are ten legs. Count them yourself. Run away! Everyone run away! In Kyung-boo high way has little bit of traffic jam, the traffic is going slow from Soowon to Dongjak bridge, The way of Pusan... Open up! Young-ho! My son must be in there. Someone help, please! There are people in there. I gotta go help. Hey, mister, my kid... Donald, don't go. Come on, Donald. Come back! You're gonna get hurt. Donald! Hey, hey, hey! Let me help! Let me help! Hey, man!

This is the last shot of the semi-finals. Ooh, now is not the time to lower her bow. Shoot! Because if she goes over the clock... Shoot! 2, 1... Oh no! The clock! You could have just let go. Park's Achilles' heel is taking too long to release. And today it cost her the title. She shouldn't have done that. She wasted much time. At this point, Park can only hope Yoon Ock-hee, Kyungbook Yecheon county office advanced to the final of individual woman for the bronze. Hyun-seo! - Hyun-seo! - Hey, come back! Gang-du! - Hyun-seo! - Hold anything! Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Sir! Sir! You have ten minutes to clear the area! Please take care of your things and evacuate. Restricted Area Come on. Soowon city hall Nam-joo. Hyun-seo! It's bronze. Bronze. Your aunt brought you a bronze medal. Hyun-seo, it's your aunt... Hyun-seo... Hyun-seo... Hyun-seo, your uncle came. Thanks to you, we're all together... Hyun-seo! Let go of me! What are you taking pictures of? What's so goddamn interesting? Fuck off! Stop taking pictures! Calling the owner of a Hyundai car, plate #2487! Hey lady, how could you park your car there? So you screwed up? I heard everything. You grabbed some other girl's hand? You left Hyun-seo on the ground? Your own daughter! You call yourself a fucking father? You son of a bitch! I thought it was Hyun-seo's hand... She's so pretty in that photo. She looks just like her mom in that photo. Do you think her mom even knows that she died? Not a chance. It's been 13 years since she popped out the baby and ran off. I'd run away too, dammit. Are you sleeping? Huh? Nam-il... You can sleep at a time like this? What are you doing to your brother? Her birth was an accident... and so was her death... Old people have always said, that an animal which kills a human should be torn limb from limb. That it's a human's duty to do so. Until I slit that beast's stomach and at least find Hyun-seo's body, I'll never leave this world in peace. Attention please! Ladies and gentlemen, those of you present at the river incident... there are probably a lot of you here... This is an important matter of life and death. Those who were at the scene... or those who have come in contact with these people! Raise your hands! This isn't something you should hide. Raise your hands. If you go home, it might affect your families. Raise 'em high! Hey, mister. What the hell is going on here? Fuck, shouldn't you start by explaining what's happening? - Yeah - Explain! An explanation should be appearing on the TV news now. To save time, we'll let the news serve as explanation. Okay, the news... the news... - Take off that shit and speak! ...isn't on now. Shit... Anyway, from this moment. you fall under our control, so start moving! This is for your own safety. We have transport buses waiting outside now. Okay, please move toward the buses in an orderly fashion. That's right. Watch your children. Oh, did anyone here touch or come into direct contact with the creature? Um... I didn't touch it. But some of its blood got sprayed in my face. Don't move! Tell him to freeze! Grab him! Grab that one! Please remain calm, people. What are you doing? My son didn't touch anything! Let go! Why are you doing this? - Gang-du! Get out of there! - Dad! - Don't go! - Dad! Gang-du, don't worry. I'm coming with you. Stop that! Hey, number 31! Stop! This is a news flash. It now appears that the creature, which disappeared after its attack, on surprised park goers today, is far more dangerous than previously assumed. U.S. Army Sgt. Donald White, who fought bravely with the creature, and lost an arm in the process, is now undergoing treatment at a U.S. Army hospital. After a thorough examination, U.S. Army medical staff have identified, an unknown virus, primarily in body parts, that came into contact with the creature. I can't give any of that information without the approval of the United States. The U.S. Army has shipped a sample of the virus to the U.S. Center for Disease Control, which confirmed that the creature from the Han River, as with the Chinese civet wild cat and SARS, is THE HOST of this deadly new virus. All military units sent to pursue and capture the creature, have been recalled due to the risk of infection. Only special forces trained in biological warfare, and disinfectant units are allowed access to the Han River area. Damn, they made a fuss dragging us in here! What is this shit? Where are all the guys in yellow? Look! The doctors aren't even wearing masks. Hello, sir! When might we be allowed to go home? - You can't go home. - What? We can't? Dad, am I dying? Don't say that! Just do what the doctors tell you. But Dad, my back feels itchy and weird. Like something's moving. Ah, shit... It's a squirmy feeling, like something's there. It's because you never take a bath, it's okay. Attention! Numbers 25-40, raise your hands. Quickly! This group, move to room 904 now. Not again! Don't tell anyone about the blood on your face, okay? - Mr. Park Gang-du? - Yes? You need to take a lot of tests, so don't eat until tomorrow morning. What? Don't eat anything? Don't feed him anything! No food! Hello? Hello? My battery is... Hello? It's me, Hyun-seo! Dad, can you hear me? Please answer me! Is this Hyun-seo? Dad, listen to me! I can't get out! You're alive? Where...? It's like a big sewer. Really big and deep. Where? Hello? Hyun-seo... - Come quick! - Hyun-seo Is it Hyun-seo? What is it? Did you see that? - What? - Wait a minute. Sweet! Hey! Hey, don't go near the water. Be careful! Let's go. I'm starving. It's okay, get back in. Mister! Mister! Try to turn... Your daughter, Park Hyun-seo, a seventh grader at Dangsan Middle School. She's on the deceased list. Yes, she goes to Dangsan School... she's deceased, but she's not dead. I mean, she died, but she's still alive. Now you're talking in circles. So, she's on the list... Wait, shut up. - At any rate, there was a call. - Right. So shouldn't you be able to trace the call or something? Trace the call? That's not something we do for just anyone. Are you even aware of how complicated that is? 'Just anyone' is that what you said? Stop it! Step back! What the... Please, officer, let's talk like reasonable people. - They're just kids, don't... - What are you doing? No, I mean... Your daughter never called you in the first place, okay? Your son had a dream, but it was so real that... You don't believe anything we said? Now you're obstructing an officer in the line of duty... Step back, Nam-joo. Officer, should I explain it again? The way it happened was... I know, I know. You yourself saw your daughter die. But she called you in the middle of the night? Does that make any sense? That's completely ridiculous! A servant of the people, talking back like that? - Then what's your problem? - Just a moment... Stop! This is... This is my daughter Park Hyun-seo. My daughter... I'm the creature. I ate her... Okay? And then... It happened like this. This is the sewer. You don't understand? He's received psychological treatment? He's not a bad man, but he's in shock. We should understand. - Hey. - I knew it! Officer! My daughter is alive in the sewer! - Officer? - Cut it out! Your putting on a damn show doesn't help! My friend's nephew's husband's brother-in-law is a cop, maybe we should contact him...? Right, I'm sure he'd bend over backwards for us. You're a college graduate, can't you even persuade a cop? What's college got to do with it? I put you through school selling cup ramen, and you... - Dad. - Huh? How long's it been since she's eaten? Down in the sewer? What's there to eat down there? You over there! Hey blondie, stop! Run! Out of the way! Catch them! Out of the way! Quick! This way! Hurry up! Gang-du, hurry up! - Which floor? - Close the door! Quick! I'm coming down, but I'm in the elevator, so... Where is he? B4 A3? What did I just say? B4 A3! A3. Where's A3? There it is! Stop! Catch that car. Hurry! Open the door! Go! Step on it! - Nam-joo! - Hurry up! Where is Nam-joo? Where is she? Did they catch her? - Oh, shit. - Where? Where? - There, there! - Where? Over there. That idiot! How could you leave your only sister? - We can pick her up! - Pick her up then! - She's always been slow... - Mister, can you stop here? Hurry up! What a dimwit! - Hurry it up, will you? - Quick! Quick! Hey, family! Everyone stop. Stop the van. Hey, stop! Just close it! Close! Did we make it? That does it. This won't do. The basic fee for pickup and the items you ordered is 7,400 dollars. Including the Han River sewer map. Plus, we brushed off a cop in the parking lot, and two police cars on the road. Anyway, including hazard fees, the total is 11,400 dollars. One of the escaping family... Wow, Gang-du on TV! That's my citizen ID photo. It's from one of those subway photo booths? Hey, we should tape this and show it to Hyun-seo. Daddy on TV... Jesus... We don't accept these. If you're short on cash, we accept cards. We'll just take the card. The blonde one, who made direct contact with it. He's the stupidest of all. That bitch! Listen to the mouth on her. He pounced on me and slammed me to the floor. I think he gave me arthritis. I'll need treatment, I'm sure. That's what he's like. I know who she is. Like we can't recognize her through that voice disguiser? But they keep reporting on us. The superior archer who escaped In addition, the daughter among the escaped family members The superior archer who escaped is confirmed to be Park Nam-joo, national bronze medalist in archery. What the hell? How come there's nothing about me? There's nothing special about you. Plenty of unemployed university grads these days... I sacrificed my youth for the democratization of our country, and those fuckers won't even give me a job. The passwords are all 4989? There's a white truck outside. It's a disinfection truck, you can take it. expressed concern that Korea is not adequately quarantining, - the infected. The U.S. also... - Come on, let's go. That's the truck? Does it really work? This is what you got after spending all your assets? This gun is... Fuck, we're not boy scouts. And why only two disinfectant suits? So two of us should just creep around hiding? Dad, shouldn't this be yellow? If it's not yellow, they're bound to catch us. Wow, this map is the topping on the cake. The red circles indicate sewers? You spent 500 dollars on this? Really? But... I got it from a civil servant who knows the sewer system. It's photocopied on the back of used paper. Hey, a guard post. Get down! Cover up, quickly! Your blonde hair is showing. Get down quickly! Whatever, you two handle it. Biohazard What? If that's their attitude, why even bother? Bunch of lazy bums. Quiet! Stop. Mr. Park? Mr. Bacteria? Lower your mask. This definitely a Daesung disinfectant truck. But are you Daesung people? Yes, but we're a different team. Oh, really? I'm Manager Cho from the district office. Don't you know who I am? You know that 14 different companies are doing the fumigation on shifts? But Daesung just barged in at the end. To the other companies, it seems odd. So I spoke with President Kwak yesterday... Not this! No! Let go... Manager Cho, this is all I have with me right now. Sorry, I'll see you later. Hey, Gang-du. Hyun-seo. It's your Dad. Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Park Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Why does he have to do that? He's not a kid. Let him be. He wants to disinfect himself. He's worried he'll pass the virus on to Hyun-seo. Virus... All of us are fine, why do they keep going on about a fucking virus? If the government says so, we have to accept it. What can we do? Is it the virus that's making me so sleepy? Hyun-seo... Look on the ground for footprints. Hey, did Hyun-seo describe any special traits of the sewer? Special traits? We need some kind of hint here. Hyun-seo said it was a big sewer. Look how big this is. Yes, it seems we'll find something. Yeah, sure! Wandering blindly through the sewers... We need to think of a better way. Stop complaining! Put your time into searching another sewer instead. Hey tortoise! Just try to keep up. Slow-ass bronze medalist. - You wanna die? - Wait! Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo! Turn it off. Something moved there. Move! It's this way! Get down! What is this? It's just water! God damn it! How typical of you. Sorry, Dad. Did you pee? Because of the bangs, a little. Why are they going around shooting? Wow, this cave really does lead to the Han River! It's not a cave, it's a sewer. They're all connected like this. Gosh, it's hard to make a living. Do we really have to go? So you're not hungry? No, I'm hungry! If we do this once, we'll eat well for a whole month. - Don't you know that? - I do. Wow, there's money too. Don't touch it. Why not? I'm taking it. If we take that too, it's theft. Put it back now, okay? We're stealing from this place anyway. Se-joo, this is not theft. We're now doing 'seo-ri'. Like melon seo-ri at a farm. Hey, do you even know what seo-ri means? No? The generation gap is pretty big. It's an old borrowing game kids play. So, seo-ri is a right of the hungry. Run! Hey. What should I do? Are you okay? Look at that... Isn't that amazing? In this situation? Wake him up, there's no time. Let him sleep a minute. He needs to sleep every so often. Should we leave him here? He's no help anyway. Kids, wait a minute. Sit down. In your view, is Gang-du really so pathetic? - Yup. - Yes. You wouldn't know it, but he was a really smart kid. For example, when he was two, he'd sit in front of the village store, and everyone walking by would ask him directions. That's how smart he looked. As you know, when he was young, I was out of my mind, hardly ever coming home, staying out all night. And this poor boy with no mother, he must have been so hungry. Going around, doing seo-ri all the time. Raising himself on organic farms. Whenever he got caught, he'd get beaten up. In this way, he lacked protein when he needed it most. So that's why, every now and then, he dozes off like a sick rooster. I think something up there... ...must have gone wrong, too. Have any of you heard it? The heartbreak of a parent who's lost a child... When a parent's heart breaks, the sound can travel for miles. So, I really need to say this to you. Be as nice to Gang-du as you can. Don't scold him, okay? Like last time, "Why'd you grab another girl's hand, moron?" You should never say things like that to him, OK? You know? I spend most of the day in the small food stand with him. So whenever I hear him fart, I can tell right away if he's in B- or A+ condition. What do you two know? But even still... our Hyun-seo... Hyun-seo? Hey, you're... It's watching. Huh? It's watching us. Fire! Do you see it? What's going on? Hyun... Hyun-seo! Quiet! It's moving! - What are you doing? Make sure it's dead! - Wait! It... It's running away! Don't get too close! Shoot! Dad! Shoot it in the legs! Shoot, right now! It's over there! - The bullets... - No bullets! - Where did it go? - Are you trying to kill us? Let's go to the truck. You all go on! I'm gonna finish that thing off! Just run! - Anyone got any bullets? - I've got one left. Good. Give it to me, and get to the truck. Dad! Come on! - Don't worry about me, go to the truck! - Dad! Dad! Just come here! I'll take you down with one shot this time. Get up here! Huh, what's that? Nam-joo! What are you doing? - Nam-joo! - When did she go out? Go back! Oh, no... Hey! Somebody come get Nam-joo! - Stop playing around! - Let go! Hurry back! Quick! No! Dad! No! Fuck! No! Dad! Dad... Dad, wake up! Dad, the soldiers are coming. Dad! You two, get outta here! Quick! Fuck! We should never have... Dad, what about Hyun-seo? Hyun-seo... We can't get caught. Hurry, hurry... Run! Run! Dad! What about Hyun-seo... Dad Dad! Freeze! Infected family located! One captured, one dead. Hey, come here right now! Yes, sir. Quickly! We have tragic news. Sgt. Donald of the 8th U.S. Army, who through his act of courage revealed, to the world the existence of the virus, died today at 4:20 PM. As condolences flood in from all over the world, 8th U.S. Army Commander Greenfield held a rare press conference. to express his condolences. Meanwhile the U.S. and WHO, citing the failure of the Korean government World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland to secure the remaining two infected family members, or to capture the creature in question, have announced a policy of direct intervention. Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, US Yes, in this context, the unprecedented use of... 'Agent Yellow', is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Agent Yellow, which has been chosen for use here in Korea, is a state-of-the-art chemical and deployment system, recently developed by the U.S. to fight virus outbreaks or biological terror. US, chose to input Agent Yellow This extremely powerful and effective system, once activated, completely annihilates all biological agents, within a radius of dozens of kilometers. 'Agent Yellow Is Unsafe' Citizen groups issue strong protest. Virus carrier Park showing symptoms similar to common cold. Indeed, we are trying to provide Mr. Park the most pleasant... environment that a patient could want... We are doing our best to accommodate Mr. Park Gang-du... - I see. - But he didn't cooperate... Wanted: Infected Family Deceased/Captured - When did you get here? - Just a minute ago. Nobody followed you, right? It's okay, I checked carefully. And Nam-joo? Where's Nam-joo? Nam-joo? Why? You travel separately, you two? So if you just type into the office's computer, it shows up? Really? Hyun-seo called late at night, right? Then the transmitter will be listed in the call records. That means she's within 200 meters of a transmitter. That's simple. It's that easy to get her location? That's right, you should have come to me earlier. Is all of your family so dumb all the time? Right... all those sewers... fuck. It's okay, finding her is just a matter of time. All thanks to you. You were always busy protesting, when did you ever study? It must be really hard getting work at a telecom firm. Still, I'm just a salaryman. But you must make 60-70 grand a year? My credit card debt is 60-70 grand. - Look. - Wait... The time, the number... Here. This is it! - Are you sure? - Yeah. Just a minute. This is definitely her call. - Type this in. - Yeah. ATR1020. It doesn't work. Really? The password... It must be in the manager's room. Hey Nam-il. where is Nam-joo anyway? Why do you keep asking? She's your sister, aren't you worried? When we left the Han River. we just separated in the sewer. I'm sure she's fine. I see... Now what? It'll be hard to get Nam-joo. Seems like he really doesn't know. Then, let's take care of Nam-il first. He's a real escape artist, though. You should be careful. Hey! By the way, how much is the tax on the reward money? Well, there's an exemption, and there's no tax on extra earnings. I see... Huh? This... Hyun-seo! Hey, it worked! - Mr. Park Nam-il, - are you feeling sick? - Greetings, Mr. Park! - Just stay right there. Wonhyo Bridge You should go to the hospital. Fuck off! What the... Hey! Come on! Shit! Hey, Yong-bae, did you see him? The cellphone is off, so record your message after beep sound, you have to pay the money for call. Nam-joo... Hyun-seo... Wonhyo Bridge... Hyun-seo! One new text message received. Hyun-seo Wonhyo Bridge North Side Hurry! It's me, Nam-joo. Nam-joo! I found it! A huge sewer. Right under the north side of Wonhyo Bridge! I can't reach Nam-il! Hello? Nam-joo! Nam-joo! Are you Okay? Hello? Nam-joo... Park Nam-joo... Nam-joo... Park Nam... Please calm down. Wonhyo Bridge... is it... where is... - Wonhyo Bridge... - It's near Yeouido, right? - Right! - I need to go out for a minute. Sit down. You need to get a shot. What kind of shot did you say this was? An anesthetic. Oh, right, right... I'll get the shot before going. - Okay, let your arm relax. - But Wonhyo Bridge... Hyun-seo is still... Grab him! Hyun-seo! - Let me go - He's really strong. She's near the north side of Wonhyo Bridge. Is Wonhyo Bridge named after the monk Wonhyo? What a funny! He wasn't a monk. He was a priest. Did you really inject the proper amount? - Yes. - For sure? We did for sure. And it's been an hour. - And he's still like that? - Yes. Then what should we do? We should start the tissue sampling now. Why's he like that? If we've anesthetized him, he should be sleeping. Why's he causing such a scene? Why? What's that scream? Don't they use anesthetic here? Oh my god! What's going on here? Well, I guess they... um... No, no, no, no... No. no... Stop this. Now. Mr. Park. I heard your daughter is still alive. I heard your daughter is still alive. Is she really alive? Is she really alive? Yes, he says his daughter is in a sewer near Won-hyo bridge. Yes, he says his daughter is in a sewer near Won-hyo bridge. Jesus, why didn't you contact the police or the military? Jesus, why didn't you contact the police or the military? Because nobody... Have you considered contacting television stations or human rights organizations, something? Have you considered contacting television stations or human rights organizations, something? Because nobody fucking listens to me, dammit! Because nobody fucking listens to me, dammit! Please don't cut me off. My words are words too... Why don't you listen to my words? The virus has definitely invaded his brain, just as we suspected. I agree. It's in the frontal lobe. This man has no previous history But now seems to have a mental problems. Yes, that's right. But now, he's obviously completely delusional. This man's brain is our last hope. His brain? Yes, the virus must be in here. It has got to be in here. Exactly, what are you talking about? You don't know about this? Now, this is strictly confidential. Even among our team, very few know what I'm gonna tell you. My lips are sealed. The late Sergeant Donald, the first one classified as the victim of the virus, was given an extensive autopsy, and no virus was found. He died of shock during the operation. Also, no traces of the virus were found in any of the patients quarantined. Simply put, so far, there is no virus whatsoever. Huh? No virus? You mean there's no virus? Right? There's no virus! You're talking about a virus that doesn't exist. Mister, they said there's no virus. So you should let me go now... My daughter Hyun-seo is under Wonhyo Bridge. I need to go quickly. Please let me go. Okay mister, huh? You shitheads! You bastards! Please mister, I beg you. Let me go. I'll give you my food stand, okay? I'll give the rights to you. What are you doing? Please, mister! Wait! Fuck! This is driving me crazy! I really need to get to Hyun-seo! Mister, please save me! What is this, please? Hyun-seo, I'm sorry... Daddy... Hyun-seo, you know what I want?
