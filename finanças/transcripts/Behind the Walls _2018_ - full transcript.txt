Too easy. [sighs] [soft ominous sound] Carrie? [ominous sound continues] [peaceful music] So. How'd it go? I don't know. Boss remembered my name. Assigned me to one of the projects he needed taking care of, and it sounds like a higher position is opening up soon. Well, that's good. I invited him over to dinner next weekend. Thought it would be nice. So. School? I don't know. It's fine. How's the food? Same. Tastes like crap. It's only temporary, guys. Karrie, please, eat your food.

We can fix this. But it will never be the same again. Will it? No, it won't. [ominous music building] So, what happened with you and Daddy? [pouring] You have to understand that love can get worn out over time and get torn. Sometimes things can get patched up for good and sometimes not. Some stitches aren't strong enough to last. [music continues] [paper rustling] [slow music] [creaking] [creaking] [creaking] [shower running] [gasps] [ominous sound] Hey!

And I'd like to go back. [music continues] And that's where my life is. I'm getting older. I have to finish school. Michael, he knows where you go to school. Do you really think that's smart? Trust me. If I ever see him again I'll kill him. It's not just you. I'm gonna be fine. I just... I want to make sure that you're going to be OK once I'm gone. [ominous sound] [glass breaking] [music continues] [soft whistling] [whistling continues] Hello, sexy. [tense music] Look at this mess. What did you do? That can't be my mother's china. Can it? No, it couldn't. I mean, nobody would be that stupid. Especially around my mother's china. [gasps] Sorry. Sorry? [music continues] You will be.

I don't blame you. You're 25, you should now have a life of your own. I'm over it. Listen, I... I know I don't say this enough, but thank you for everything that you do. [sighs] I know I haven't been the best mom, and I'm sorry, I'm trying. Mom. You know I'm bitter. No. Little bit. I'm sorry about school. It's all right. I've got a back-up plan. You wanna talk about it? No. I'm sorry aboutyour job, though. It's OK. [music continues] I just wanted to say thank you. [music continues] Don't mention it. [ominous rumbling sound] [pills rattling] [ominous bubbling] [ominous whoosh] [ominous bubbling continues] [scream] [ominous sound] Karrie! Karrie, honey. What's wrong? What's wrong? Just relax.

It was just a bad dream. Tell me what happened. No. You won't love me anymore. That's crazy. Of course I love you. Let me get Froggy, hold on. OK, here you go. He'll make you feel better. Tell me what happened. I, I dreamed that Derry was burning. [sudden ominous sound] He was on fire, burning. I was dreaming of Karrie but, I just couldn't... [indistinct chatter] What? Get her to wake up. That evil, it's my fault. Sweetheart. I'm scared, Mikey. It's just a bad dream, pal. No. I'm scared of Karrie. Why do you say that? It's her new friends. I'm scared of her new friends. Sometimes I hear them talking when no one's around. I think they live in the basement. [door creaks, shuts] [slow footsteps] [exhales] [ominous sound] [sighs] [mechanical sound] What are you doing down there? Nothing. I was looking for something. [soft creaking] Karrie. Karrie. Mmm. [slow footsteps] [sighs] [footsteps continue] [sighs] [dramatic beat] Hello, sexy. nWhat are you doing up this time? Darren? I know. I know. Home late from work again. It's what I do. [slurps] Work, work, work. What's wrong, Kathy? Scared or something? Are you afraid? You afraid of me, darling? Oh. [slurping] Sweetheart, all I do is work. All I do is... [slurps] everything for you. All I ask is a little a little affection. And yet you deny me. [music continues] [slurping] I gotta tell you, it hurts. My mother used to say that in god's eyes a woman who refuses her man is no better than a sodomized whore that a married woman should be down on her knees and thank the Lord to be of service to her man. You you piss me off. [dramatic sound] [grunting] I sense we've gotsome unfinished business. You could never finish. [dramatic sound] [grunting] [dramatic music pulsing] grunting] [glass shatters] [whistling] See you guys later. Mikey. Buddy, you can'tgo with me this time. OK?

I'm, I'm sorry,Karrie, but I was scared. What else is new? Close the door. [indistinct whispers] [whispering continues] Mom? Mom? Are you awake? I think there's something wrong with Karrie. [dramatic sound] -What were you telling Mikey? -What are you talking about? Mikey and Mom can't know my friends and you're...you're making fun of me! [scuffling sounds] You're not going anywhere! You've hardly been a family again and you want to leave. Isn't this house for rent. This house is gonna bring me back and I'm not going to leave you. Not you or your whore mother! Do you hear me? -Get her!-Karrie? Derry? Guys. What happened? Derry... [indistinct] and he pushed me out. -Derry! -I didn't mean it! It's OK, sweetie. He'll be fine. We'll get some thread and fix it. You wouldn't care. You'd throw it away if you wanted to. That's not true, Karrie. I'm going to get the sewing kit. I don't know what I'm gonna do with you. [door creaks, shuts] [ominous music] Derry, in the corner. I'm sorry, Mom, it was an accident. I don't care! Go! Karrie, tell her. I didn't mean to. The drawer did it. Now! Derry. It wasn't my fault.

Say something. It's on the corner. What? What are you talking about? Behind the wall. There's nobody there. [erratic breathing] No. Don't. It's OK. [soft pulsing music] It's OK, Derry. Nothing's here. It was... That's stupid. Derry'sjust being a scaredy-cat. -I'm not! -Stop! I hate it here! [creaking] [ominous bubbling sounds] [indistinct voices on television] [tender music] Shit. Disappointed? [ominous sound] Hey. Not going to the party? No. Then do you have anything to drink? I hope this is OK. Yeah. It's OK. This doesn't look so bad. Yeah, well, dimlighting does wonders for most ugly things. So you're into looks. I mean, personality goes a long way, too. Right. So how long have you lived here? For as long as I can remember. Your folks? Just me. Independent. I like that. No, I just haven't found the right relationship yet. I've felt trapped for so long. Yeah, I know the feeling. I've never had anyone. Which is? A family. It must be nice. To be loved. [music continues] [scratching sound] I'm so sorry. I do that sometimes. It's OK. I forgotsomething in the kitchen. [sighs] Did I scare off another one? Actually, you might be thebest thing in my life right now. Changed your mindabout this place? Thinking about it. You have no idea what this means to me.
