MIYAMOTO VILLAGE What will you do? Have you made a decision? - Are you going? - I am. I'll be famous after my first battle. Then what will the village elders say? What do you say? Join me. Oh, yes. You have your mother to look after. And Otsu to marry. I'm all alone. You aren't. I'll go alone. Takezo! You're so bad! Climbing trees again! Takezo. The priest will scold you. Really, Takezo! You too, Matahachi! Listen, Otsu. You're engaged to me, aren't you? If, well, for instance, if... If I left for a year, what would you do? Would you wait for me? Where are you going? I'm not going anywhere. I mean, just in case. I would wait. For a year, even for 10 years. You will? You're going to battle? No. Not I. You lie! Takezo has tempted you. Don't go, please! What will become of me? I've tested your love. Don't go! I'll never leave you. BATTLE OF SEKIGAHARA Look! What's that? Run for your life! Run! No use digging! Run! Quickly! Takezo! Unbelievable! Where are our troops? The enemy has crossed the river. We've been defeated! Routed! Damn it! Can this be the end of the war? They make us dig like slaves. But the war is lost! - You run. - And you? Our cause is not lost. I'll fight on. - Me, too. - No. Run! It's not over yet. I may get a captain's head. Courage, Matahachi! It's a minor wound. I'll die. Don't talk like that. I want to live to see Otsu. Courage! I see a house. Where? I can't quite make it out. Keep your strength up. Otsu is an orphan. After I'm gone, please look after her. Spare no one! Search everywhere! Look! Matahachi! The house! I can't go on. It's true! Look! Flowers on a single spray I left behind Where would they blossom? Mother! Give us food! And keep quiet! You must be hungry. Sorry I'm late. Matahachi. Thank you. I'll eat later. I'm tired of eating gruel. Your wound is healing fast. It's been two months already. Where is Takezo? - Riding again. He likes to. It's not just that. He's trying to conquer the horse. He rides until he exhausts it. He's always been ruthless. I like that type of man. How I long for home! But this must heal first. The skin hasn't healed over. - I can walk, though. - Don't overexert yourself. We can't stay here forever. But we're glad to have you. You see, we're all alone. It's lonely here. Stay until you recover. The enemy might discover us. They don't look for such unimportant - Pardon me! Unimportant! That's right. Let me do it. We left home thinking we could become samurai so easily. What a dream! Bear it, weakling! Takezo! Give me a ride! Otsu, my love! Forgive me. Who is this Otsu? A girl from our village. Your sweetheart? No, Matahachi's betrothed. - Matahachi's? - A nice, sweet girl. And she excelled at rough riding. You think I'll be frightened? You will be if I let him loose. I won't be! Try it! You'll scream. Your mother will be angry. Don't worry. I won't scream. Please! - Stubborn girl! - Coward! - Coward? - You big coward! Don't cry out! Are you all right? Damn horse, you scared the hell out of us! It's not his fault. You think it's mine? Don't be angry. Takezo, why don't you hold me in your arms? Women! Wench! Listen! Is your mother home? Warn her! Tell her she's trespassing! We'll collect our share of the tribute soon! Remember! I'll run you two out of this territory unless you behave! Who's that? A bandit. Hurry. He'll be back again. Say! This is splendid. What's your trade? Outwardly, herb farming. And actually? Actually? - Are you connected with the bandits? - To some extent. Mother. This is solid gold. It is. Splendid! Stripping dead samurai? Yes. Otherwise we can't live. - You're not scared? - Of what? - And you? - Of course not. They're dead. Will that bandit Tsujikaze really come? Doesn't your mother plan to run away? Is your hiding place far? Please speak to me. Don't be angry with me. Forget it! You have Otsu. Tsujikaze has no right to stop me. I can do whatever I like. He killed my husband. That's what people say. But I hate to believe it. Even though my man was a bandit as well, he was a bigger man, stronger and finer. It's smoky in here. Drink? - I cannot. Give me that wooden sword. You're a child. I won't be here long. I'll go to Kyoto City for some real business. What about you? I can't go home yet. Waiting for another battle? First fame, then I shall return home. - Parents? - No. - Relatives? - Yes. I'm unruly, so they hate me. - Lonely? - No. May you have good fortune. I will. - Already! - Tsujikaze? Good! I'll test this. - Wait. Are you alone? Where's the wench? Hey! Bring out the treasure quietly, quick! Or you'll regret it! Woman, don't you dare fool me. Search for it! The ceiling! Look up there! The ceiling! Who are you? Kill him! I'll never let you go. Never! What are you doing? A woman is drawn to a strong man. You make me feel like a woman. Take me, Takezo. Don't you understand how I feel about you? It's like death for a woman to say such a thing aloud. Take me. I'm all yours. Do whatever you want with me. Bastard! Who was that running past us? Must we leave at once? Yes. We have to get out before dawn. Tsujikaze's got hundreds of men. They won't just let us be. We'll fight. We'll wait for Takezo, won't we? He won't come back. Why not? He attempted to assault me. He's a savage! I resisted him. He ran away. Matahachi. You're gentle and kind, unlike that wild boar. Please help us. Will you? Please do. Takezo! That fool! What about your mother and Otsu? You fool, Matahachi! Give them our gold. Never! Our lives are at stake. Don't touch the women! We can talk! Stop! Matahachi! You're brave! ALL TRAVELERS MUST SHOW PROPER IDENTIFICATION TO PASS VIOLATORS WILL BE PUNISHED Where do you think you're going? - Miyamoto. - Miyamoto village? I'm going back there. He looks suspicious. Seize him! Priest Takuan. Look at yourself. "Throughout the heavens and the earth, I alone am noble." Drink, my newborn Buddha! Find me a drying pole instead. I washed my only clothes. What will you do in the meantime? I'll stay like this. Please! It's unbecoming. What do you mean? Human beings are born naked. Oh! You priests! Mother Osugi. - Otsu! My dear! - What's happening? I hear Takezo broke through the guard and is in this area. We may hear about Matahachi. So you are Takezo's relatives? We are quite distant relatives, sir. And we have nothing to do with him. He was such an unmanageable fellow. We drove him out. We call him "The Lawless." Very well. Now listen. I am organizing a hunt for him, with this temple as my base. All of you will cooperate and assist us! Understand? That "Lawless" Takezo is a terror. He let my son die alone and he shamelessly came home. We must punish him. Matahachi, where are you? How criminal! Bloodshed in a temple! What audacity to come here! He's a demon. A devil, indeed! The village will be penalized for this! Understand? Two from each family shall report at once for the hunt! That's an order! Hurry up! Now arrest all villagers related to him! They will be the bait! Come on! You lazy louts! Are you dead? Hurry up! Hurry up! Thank you for your work. If Matahachi is dead, what will you do? I'll still consider you my daughter-in-law. You are, aren't you? Aren't you? - Yes. I'm relieved to hear that. It would not be proper to leave you at the temple too long. You will live here with me. Or don't you like that idea? You should like it. I shall teach you to sew and weave. Mother Osugi. Takezo! Listen. Matahachi is not dead. I came to tell you that. He's not dead. - Where is he? - I don't know. But he's alive. - What's he doing? I cannot... tell you that. Do not ask me! Takezo. Where are you going? I hate this village. I came to tell you about your son. I'm glad. But you mustn't leave so quickly. Aren't you hungry? I haven't eaten for days. Poor Takezo. I'll get you something. No guard will ever look here. Take a bath, too. Yes. This is wonderful, so calm, so nice. I thought Mother Osugi would be bitter. I'm bitter. You didn't bring him back to me. Why didn't you? I blame you. I'm sorry. I couldn't. But why won't you tell me the reason? What's he doing? - I cannot tell you that. Mother Osugi! Quiet! A trap! Osugi! Traitress! I came to comfort you. And you betrayed me! Matahachi deserted me! He's weak! A coward! Reinforcements arrived from the castle today. REWARD: FOR CAPTURE, KILLING OR INFORMATION ABOUT MUSASHI The roadways and hills are covered by guards. He's trapped. Villagers shall continue the hunt day and night! Hurry up! Hurry! Why don't we go to the room over there? Quiet. Otsu. A letter. TO OTSU IN MIYAMOTO VILLAGE FROM MATAHACHI AND OKO What happened? Matahachi has been my lover since the Great Battle. We have since married. I learned of his betrothal to you as he spoke in his sleep. You must not wait for him. Your heart must not cry. You're out to capture me too? No, you're mistaken! Spare me! I'll get you later! It's terrible! Come, somebody! Takezo did this. Otsu, I'm going into the mountains. The mountains? All this commotion just to catch one man is idiotic. The villagers are frightened. You... alone? So many men have already failed to catch him. Do you think I should mind my own business? No. Wait and see. I'll bring him back in due time. Priest Takuan. I'll go with you. That's why you came with me. You wanted to hear more about Matahachi. He was unfaithful. Forget him. I'm glad for you. You're young. I can't think that way. What troubles you? I'm frustrated. My heart is broken. Forgive me. I didn't mean to make you cry. Otsu. Play the bamboo flute. It heals sorrows. Meanwhile, the food will get warm. Good evening. Isn't it cold and damp out there? Come closer to the fire. Priest, are you talking to yourself? Not at all, look out there in the reeds. Wait. Come here. We will not harm you. Here are fire and food to warm you up. We're not your enemies. No, not at all. Let us talk by the fire. Come. Here. Come over here. Is it good? Eat. - Why are you here? - To capture you. If you surrender to a Buddhist priest, consideration shall be given to you. Never! My boy! Do you think you can win? Yes. Are you trying to defeat yourself, too? I don't mind dying in a good fight. But before I die, I will have some blood! What about your relatives? They're prisoners on your account. What relatives? They all hate me! - Some are suffering. - Hang them all! Better off dead, all of them! Even the women? Quiet! And their children? I don't care. Let all of them... Fool! Wild fool! I punish you, with the hand of your parents! Takezo has been captured! Takezo's captured! Heave-ho! Let me down, you bastards! I did not capture him for the reward. You say you will not deliver him to me? If you refuse to leave him to me, I shall free him. Then recapture him yourself. - What do you mean? Do you want to kill me? Good. Deliver my head to Himeji Castle, to Lord Ikeda. He would probably say, "Good priest Takuan, where is the rest of you?" Is my Lord your friend? Take my head and find out. Cut it off properly. I beg you a thousand pardons, Your Grace! But what about Takezo? Will you let me handle him my way? Yes. If you'll give me his head later. Don't be ridiculous. Funerals are my job. I would have no work if you got the corpses also. Takuan! What is it? I have something to tell you. Come closer! Here I am. What do you want? Why don't you behead me? You shame me this way! And you call yourself a priest? Don't you know how to treat a samurai? Idiot! You're a spirited one. Lout! I could have crushed you! Too bad you didn't. I surrendered believing you were a man of high virtue. A true sign of stupidity. I did nothing! I'm not ashamed. I'm a samurai! Are you? Samurai? With your spirit, you won't die for some time. What? Priest! You're trash! Please! Why be so cruel? He's helpless. It's not your concern. Yes, it is. I helped capture him. No! I insist that I have my way in this. I can't believe this. I can't trust anyone. Oh, if only I had great strength! Takezo! - Maybe he's dead. - He's still alive. Let's stone him and see! Children! Go home! Whether Matahachi is dead or alive, you're my daughter-in-law. Understand? Mother Osugi, are you telling me to die? Fool! I'm telling you to leave the temple and join my household. But to me that will mean only death. Why? A house without love is a living death. Quiet! How dare you say that! You are a mere child. Ungrateful young wench! Priest! Priest! Please! Are you still there? Come inside. It's cold. Have mercy on him. Please cut him down. No! Impossible! I'm begging you. He'll die. No! Please! For mercy's sake! Priest Takuan, I promise to do anything. Only forgive him! It is justice! You're merciless! A devil! A demon! Takezo. What do you want, trash? You still have your tongue, I see. Maybe you will live. Shut up! Behead me! It's dangerous. Even after death, your head would jump at me. Isn't the moon beautiful tonight? Poor fellow. At last he's lost his reason. Silence! My body will kill you when I fall! That's the spirit, my boy! Easy now. Such a futile struggle. But you could use that force for the good of humanity. God and man would be moved. Nay, even the universe. A man must know awe, and fear God. Conceited in your strength, you ignored wisdom and virtue. You thought you could defeat the world. Look at yourself! Wisdom and strong virtue combined make a man. Understand? Think it over till dawn. I shall behead you then. Wait. Good priest, is it true? I am truly a man. Do not let me die like an animal. Spare my life! I want to live. God help me live! Well said. However, life is like a real battle. There is no rematch. Prepare for death, recite the Sutras of the Buddha. Otsu! Otsu, why? Don't ask me. Let's run. They'll kill us at first sight. Otsu. Is this a dream? Am I alive? I'm so hungry. Takezo, I have rice cakes in my parcel. But I can't open it. My hands! I'm sorry, will you open it? Otsu. Thank you! It's all right. I'm such a fool. I apologize. I apologize! As I was gazing at you, bound and hanging, I saw that I too was bound by an unseen rope. And I could not cut the rope by myself. Takezo. I cannot go back. Take me with you. Do you hate me? Once. But now... - And I... - Please! What would I do if you discarded me? I'm alone. All alone in this world. Me, too. Then you must know how I feel. But I have no power to make you happy. Takezo. Both of us are lonely. Look! Takezo! Capture them! Fire a signal! Use the gun and powder! This way, hurry! Leave me here. You run alone. I can't! Wait for me here. Understand? Wait here! Takezo! Otsu! Takezo! HIMEJI CASTLE Mother Osugi! Mother Osugi! What is it? Otsu's been taken to the castle. Takezo escaped capture. Quiet, everybody! Old one! Prepare for a trip. To defend the prestige of my name! We will kill Otsu and Takezo! Listen. You shall have the first cut at Takezo. Me? The first cut? Yes. And I'll do the beheading. Watch your step. Silence, fool! You're the clumsy one. Don't make us look after you. Takezo. Are you still an animal? Otsu rescued me. I must get her out! Fool. She's safe. Follow me. Priest Takuan! She is safely sheltered near Hanada Bridge. You dirty lying rogue! Open up! Open the door! Takezo. This room will be yours for some time. Otsu will wait. You lie! She's alone! She will wait. In those books are many of the things you need. After you master them, I will see you again. Farewell. HANADA BRIDGE It may be years. You'll be waiting faithfully? - Yes. - Oh, my! As you wish. As you know, a priest has little understanding of love matters. Farewell. KYOTO If, sadly The sky tonight Should happen to be cloudy Let it be cloudy I care not anyway For with tears in my eyes The moon will seem blurred That's not the song of a child! When did she learn it? Probably in secret for tonight. You're in love. Akemi, how old are you? Guess how old I am. Sixteen? No, seventeen. Was I mistaken? - She's already 21. Amazing! She looks so young. Is that true, Toji? I'm happy. I wish I could be sixteen forever. - Why? That's when something wonderful took place. What was it? It was the year of the Battle of Sekigahara. I was sixteen then. Yes, and? Akemi. Don't talk of old wars. You see, those days bring ugly memories to me, but probably not to a child. By the way, we should go to the Kabuki theater. Right, Master? Yes, let's. Will you go, Akemi? Wonderful! Let's change. You go as you are. Excuse me a moment. Fetch the sedan chairs. - I'll go. - No, I'll go. We wouldn't want Master Yoshioka to get lonely. Akemi, finish that story. - It's a secret. - About a man? Well... We'll offer Akemi to Seijuro in return for a fee. She would displease him. Jealous? Interested in him yourself? - Please. - Just kidding. If he accepts Akemi, we can live in luxury together. He's here? Where are you going? How long must you flatter that young fool? I know my own business. You'd even sell your own daughter? You're a strange woman. You've destroyed my life. What kind of a man are you? I wish I hadn't rejected Takezo that night. He's a man. I'm your husband. An idiot, you mean. Order the sedan chairs. Four of them. Otsu! Since Takezo comes from Miyamoto village, Musashi Miyamoto will be his new name. Musashi, it is good. You do not wish to be in my service? Why? I am far from ready, sir. So you will take a journey to continue your training? Yes, my Lord. I pray for him, my Lord. He'll need more than that to protect him. The world is vast and boundless. Be steadfast. Good-bye. What is it? May I bid Otsu good-bye? No. The parting will be sad, my friend. I must tell her I'm leaving. - I will tell her for you. - But - - No. - She saved my life. - So you must see her? - Yes. Takezo. Is that the only reason? If so, I will not stop you. But you must have another reason. Yes? Takezo. Cut off the past. You are a new man. Reborn, as it were. Break free from the past. Thank you very much. Please come again. Welcome. Takezo! I've waited. You've been cruel. Otsu. Give me up for dead. I cannot! It is our fortune. Then what have I waited for these three years? You told me we would help each other to a new life! Was that a lie? A whim? Forgive me. No! It's cruel of Priest Takuan, too. Please, Takezo. Take me with you wherever you go. One does not take a woman along on a journey of training. But why can't I be with you? Have I displeased you, Takezo? No. I love you, Otsu. I constantly thought of you in the castle. Then why can't I? If you care for me, do not follow. I will follow even beyond the Great Seas. Take me with you. I will not hinder you. Take me. If I trouble you, leave me in the wilderness, or anywhere you like. I shall be obedient. But take me with you! I'll prepare to leave. Wait here. Please. Wait! FORGIVE ME Takezo! FORGIVE ME THE END
