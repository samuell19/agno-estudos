Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God. Believe also in me. I can't believe she's gone. I know. I don't know what to say. I mean, I know what I wanna say, but I just- - It's okay, you don't have to say anything. It's just gonna be a lotta work. You mean the ranch? Should I even go back? Lizzy, what are you talking about? You love that place, okay? She gave it to you. She left it for you. Okay, so don't make any decisions right now. Just stay there for a couple days and see how you feel, okay? I've just never been there for one single day by myself. And now I'm the only one left and I'm gonna have to figure out how to take care of the ranch by myself and- - Hey, hey, hey, you're working yourself up. Okay, look, you're very smart. You know that. Your grandmother knew that. You're gonna make the right decisions. Just for right now, let's just take it one day at a time, okay? Okay. Besides you have me here whenever you need me Grandma said anything worth having wasn't gonna be easy. Let's go. Hey, Hope. Yeah, there you go. I got one for you too. Hey. Legacy's so pretty. Yeah, and she's bigger than Hope already. Yeah, I guess she is. I want to enter the Midstate Happy Valley Saddlery Event Series. It's three events, dressage, cross-country, and show jumping. You wanna do all those? Yeah, I mean, I was competing before college, although it's been a while since I've done some serious training. I don't even remember the last time I took Legacy out. Be a lot easier if Hope could still compete. Well, I think Legacy's just as good as Hope. And I know you believe that too. I mean, I want to do this. I know I do, because if I'm gonna be here at the ranch, then I need to be riding. And if I'm good, then maybe we can get some students and some horses to train and sell. Plus like with these events, I think they win like $5,000 or something. Then what's the problem? No, I'm just wishing I'd actually done some training in college instead of just focusing on classes and my social life. It'd be way less daunting. Okay, it's gonna be a lotta work and you shouldn't worry about that because I've seen you and Legacy and you guys could be unstoppable. I mean, I feel like I'm back at square one, but I'm on my own. Okay, hold on a minute. First of all, you're not on your own. You have me here with you. And secondly, you're not at square one. You know how to ride, you know how to compete, and I know you know you're good. So where do you want these bowls? Right here again? - Do you want 'em up here? - Yeah. Shall I? You got mad at me last time I put them here. Stop, just stop. Well, once I, yeah- Hi, I'm Hailey and this is my glam-mother. Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. We were at the funeral with you, but you were, you know, naturally upset. I just didn't feel it was the right time to introduce myself. Do you guys wanna come in? Sure, thank you. Who's this? Oh, this is Queen Charlize de la Pusa Soliel but you can call her Charlizey. Okay. I love your grandma. Yeah, we were really tight, you know? Actually I moved away and I just came back for the funeral and we're here now because we thought you might need some help. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be rude but I don't really know how you guys could help me. Well, you just never know what comes up, you know? It's nice to have someone around. I could make you a cup of tea. How would that help? Sure. She's potty trained. Okay, if I put her down? Yeah. Yeah? Of course. I mean, there's something that I'm seeing in your eyes, it's so strange because it kinda reminds me of me when I was younger. What kinda tea do you want? Green works. Oh, look, it's still here. Do you know anything about horses? A little. See, I'm thinking about getting back into eventing. I've been away at school for the past couple years so I haven't been here very much but when grandma left me the place, instead of looking for a real job, I've just been thinking about riding all the time. Sometimes it's good to do what you think about. They have eventing shows around here all the time. I always go and see them. Do you ride? No, Charlizey, don't do that! Yes, good job, Lizzy! Lizzy, You guys look great out there. I know, she's made for this. Oh man, it's gonna be different, but I know that if I give her my time, we're totally gonna be ready for the next event. You know, I was thinking it's not too long before the next round of competition start back up. We could just wait until then. What, no, I mean, did you see us out there? When we're together, everything just changes. I don't know, I just- I always thought I was gonna be at some boring regular job, but this just feels so right. I know we can win this one. Yeah, well, I was just thinking you know, it's not just about you guys being great together. You know, Legacy's still gotta learn some technique in the jumping and we just need a little more time. Yeah, I know. But- You don't have to sound so disappointed in me. Oh, I'm not disappointed. I'm just thinking that, you know, I don't want you pushing yourself too hard. Don't worry, I won't. I mean... Look, well, looks like I can't do anything anyways. All this stuff's falling apart. Reins, gotta get a new saddle and... It's a sign, I guess. You're right. Well, if you really wanna do it, we can just get new ones. I can't be spending money on all this stuff. I mean it's expensive and I gotta take care of the ranch. Yeah, well that's never stopped us before. We can get whatever we put our minds to. I mean, what am I even doing here, James? I thought I'd just put all this stuff behind me. Come on, let's go. Okay. Hi. I am looking for somebody completely different. I'm so sorry. Wait, you're Lizzy, right? Yeah, I don't think we've met before. I'm Hailey's mother. Linda? Hi, oh, come on in, grab a seat. What a happy surprise. Yeah, what's going on? You knew my grandma and you knew she kept horses. Well, I have this horse. Her name's Legacy and she's amazing. And she wants to do eventing. I just know she does. And I know she's gonna be great and I wanna do it with her, but my saddles and my reins, they're all old and falling apart. So I was wondering if you could just help me. Sorry. That's all right. I was gonna pay you a visit you. You beat me to it. Oh. You got a great place here. I mean all these ribbons and trophies, are they all yours? All mine. Wow, I used to dream about decorating my room like this but I never envisioned this many. Back then, I was riding just a little bit older than you. I was considered an upper level rider. Yeah, I can see that. So you paid me a visit. You need some gear. Why don't you just take a look around your shoulder there in the corner. Wow. Go ahead and take a closer look. What? Are you sure? Oh yeah, absolutely. You think Legacy will like them? Oh, I know, she'll love them. I mean, I could never afford this kinda quality. I haven't even started paying off my student loans yet. Here I am going into eventing. I just wanna do it right, you know? But I don't think I could pay you. You don't have to, Lizzy, they're a gift. You have no idea what this means to me. I think I do. I mean, look around. I understand what all this is about. I do, you know, I just know that if it's in your blood, there's nothing you can do about it. Thank you. You're welcome. So do you have a trainer? No. Why? Because if you'd let me, I'd like to help you. Yeah, you've got this fire in your eyes. I haven't seen that since I saw it in my own. Really? Yeah, it burns brightly. Look, it can't hurt to have somebody in your corner. Someone there to get your back. Yeah, I love that. Then I'm gonna unpack my bags and stay. Let's go to work. All right, so where do we start? Follow me. Okay. You guys are really good. Well, we still got a lotta work to do I love dressage. It's my favorite to watch. That's the part that I fear getting wrong the most. Why? It's poetry in motion. I mean, I look into her eyes and can see what she's thinking. You know, I was there and she was born. So it's like we're in sync. So if something goes wrong out there, it's all my fault. So then it should be easy. It requires a perfect focus and there's no way to hide any mistake you might make out there. You know you're better at this than you think. Well, thanks. Go Legacy! Hey. Hey, what is all this? Just a little something I made for the two of us. And the rose petals? Decoration. Do you like it? Yeah, I just feel a little under dressed. Well, Lizzy you're always beautiful. So did you make all this? I did. When'd you learn how to cook? I've picked up a few things in my day. Lizzy, I've thought about this a million different ways and I realized the best way to do this is right here, right now. Lizzy Evans, will you marry me and make me the happiest man alive? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. I love you. I love you too. Oh, it's beautiful. Good job. That is just gorgeous. James, you did an amazing job. How sparkly. Congratulations. You take care of my girl, all right. I will, yes sir. You knew? Yeah, he actually came and asked for my permission, if you believe it So cute. Was he nervous? Yeah. I raised him right. Yeah, that was no easy feat. He was so stubborn as a kid. I'm just glad he found somebody who will put up with him. He asked permission, like a gentlemen. I love that. I will say he is quite the insistent young man. Almost felt like I had to say yes or else. Stop it. But you wanted to, right? Yeah, we want you guys to be happy. But we had reservations Reservations? We all had them, Lizzy. Yeah, I still can't really believe it happened. I know. I'm in a state of shock myself But you're all happy for us, right? I mean, we wanna share our lives together and we can only really do that by getting married. Sweetheart, of course we are, but- - Why is there a but? Mom, you love everything to do with weddings. You used to flip through magazines with me, showing me what dress I should wear for my wedding and now I'm getting married, there should be no buts. Listen we, we just think that, well, you're a little too young. Too young, really? Lizzy, we think it too. I mean, you're still really just a couple of kids. Of course we do. This is a really big deal. You're talking about a spring wedding. But I think that's just taking things a little too quickly. That's for sure. And Lizzy, you just finished college. Yeah, maybe put on the brakes. I mean, what's another year? Well, we're not kids anymore. We know what we want and we wanna be together. We're just asking you guys to be a part of our future. We just hope you can agree to that. Please. Okay, I don't wanna argue with you guys. Can we just not talk about this right now? We just want you two to take a little more time. Like give it a year. That's not so long, is it? Dad? You guys are still very young. You've got so much growing up to do. Marriage is a big step. It's a lifelong commitment. And I understand that. I do. You don't have to get married now. I mean, what's the rush? What were you thinking? You guys are talking like Lizzy and I just met, like, we've gone through a big deal. I've given this a lot of thought. I really have. It's gonna happen. There's nothing that's gonna change your mind, is there? I'm happy. You guys can see that right? Couldn't you just be happy for us? Proud of you. Thanks, Dad. You guys drive safe. All right, we'll see ya. You know, I'm not by myself. I've got plenty of people to help me. I can do this. I'm not being self-righteous when I say that I mean, I know I wasn't the best kid growing up and I put you guys through a lot, but you guys sent me here to grow up. I can't leave this place now. I mean, Grandma left it to me for a reason Honey. You know there is such a thing as biting off more than you can chew? Lizzy, we're your parents. I'm not asking for your permission. I'm just asking you to trust me. You can't talk me out of this. I know what I'm doing here and with my life. So you can support me or you can leave it's up to you. So when did you know? Know what? When did you know you wanted to marry me? Well, the first minute I saw you, it's just a matter of timing. You're cute. I like it when you're being cute. What's wrong? Bad time with my parents, but talking to them, maybe they were right. I mean, I'm going to be really busy with all this eventing and figuring out how to take the ranch, take care of the ranch on my own. You know, maybe we should put it off another year. I'm really surprised that you're the one saying this. I mean, shouldn't we put the brakes on it? I don't think we should at all. Doesn't this feel right to you? We're not going to see very much of each other at all. I've seriously gotta train if I wanna get Legacy competition ready and taking care of this ranch. I mean, you get to go home. I have to stay here. Okay, I understand that. And I know that, but I know that I also love you and I will be here with you as much as I possibly can. And then once we get married, my home will be here with you. We're really gettin' married, aren't we? There's no other way around it. It's gonna happen. Even our parents are- - Hey, we will show them. We belong together, okay? And it's gonna be hard work, but I know that you're not afraid of hard work. And what about you? Me, I'm not too partial to hard work, but for you, you know, I can try it. What are you doing? I forgot to play this when I first proposed to you, but... What? You go, girl. first event of the season! Yeah, dressage. I haven't actually done this with Legacy before, so I'm a little nervous about it. Oh, you'll be great. I mean, cross country, I'm looking forward to but then there's show jumping and I'm nervous again. I know Legacy is gonna be great but I'm not so sure about myself. You need to stop thinking about the things you're worried about. Right answer. Okay, I wanna see you in action. Oh, well, I am a little rusty, so please not judge me too hard. Why don't you like showjumping? It's not that I don't like it. It's just that it's a lot. I have to get Legacy over these really high jumps and it's all timed, so I have to keep going constantly. And if I make a mistake, that adds penalties onto our score and that stuff we can't afford. And then the more we do it, the more tired we get and the more penalties add up. And it's just this vicious cycle and- - Why are you thinking about mistakes that you haven't made yet? I mean, and you're not going to make them, but you're gearing up against yourself before you even get out there, babe. I have to think about everything. I mean, it's all up to me and it's right around the corner. You got one thing to think about, right now, one thing, your relationship to Legacy. That's it. Yeah, we have been through a lot together. And you have something so special together. Never give up on yourself, okay? Just remember why, why are you competing? Let's go. Let's go have a party. Come on. All right, you wanna tie that one off? Hey, you're new here right? Yeah, I am. Oh, that's wonderful. You know if you don't mind me saying, your horse looks a little out of shape. We haven't been training very long so. You know, I really wouldn't dream of competing with an inexperienced horse. I trained for mine for like two years before even thinking about stepping into an events space. Well, she's a lot more fit than you think she is. I don't think you should be here. You're gonna get in everyone's way. And you know, everybody here is really serious about this. Do you even know what dressage is. I do actually. You did it! Yay, I am so proud of you! For what? For what? I messed up. Oh, so what? You've got two more competitions. - This was your first. - Yeah, but- - You set out to do something and you did it. That's something to be proud of. Why do I feel like this? I feel like I shouldn't even be here. Okay, then let's go home. You wanna go out and give this the best you got? Then that's all I wanna hear. I want you to focus. Want you to do it. That's it. Those other girls though. There's this one. She was just- - She was just what? She was saying things, you know, like making fun of Legacy. I wanna do this, but I also wanna make Legacy look good. Legacy looks good. You just think about the relationship you have with that horse. Forget about the laughter. Forget about the girls. Forget about all of it. Just focus on the now and what you're doing now. Huh? - Yeah. - Yeah? - We'll stay and do this? - Yeah. Okay, let's go. Lizzy, you guys looked so great out there. I didn't know Legacy was such an awesome dancer. Well, yeah I still messed up though. No, no, you didn't. Look you haven't been going at it for too long but look you put your mind to something and you're actually doing it. I guess I just feel like I rushed into everything, you know? I think I should've waited like you said. James? Hey, no way. You know her? James, I can't believe it's really you. It's me. So how's life been since school? Really crazy. Crazy, like you just got out of prison crazy or you're now a millionaire? Like engaged. Oh, you're the one with the new horse. Dressage is hard, isn't it? Especially when your horse has a mind of its own. Well, I'm the one who messed up so. Well, at least you finished the performance. Managed to stay on the horse. That's what people keep telling me. So marriage, I can't believe it. You're still so young. Yeah, you actually sound just like my parents right now. Well, congratulations. I know I could never do something like that. I've just got too much going on. Eventing always takes up so much time, you know? And I just have one eye on getting onto an Olympic team one day. I couldn't even think about anything else. Well, when you love something, you can find the time. Well, marriage just, I never would have put you down for something like that, but whatever makes you happy. Yeah. Oh, hey, why don't you come to the wedding? I'll send you an invite. Well, if I can spare an afternoon, I'll try but no promises. I have two more days of competition and then I gotta watch the tapes and then I have another event to prepare for. But you know, I get very serious about this. It's really not a place for amateurs. Yeah, no, I get that. Sure. But to tell you the truth, I find weddings kind of boring. Well I'll sure see you later James. And I'll see you at the next competition. See ya. So, that girl, you guys seem pretty friendly. I've never heard you mention her before. What's the matter, you don't like her? You heard what she said about Legacy. I didn't, but yeah, we're good friends. I mean, we went to the same high school together. Took a lotta the same classes. So that's it, you're just good friends? I promise, I wouldn't lie to you. I can't. Good. What's the matter? I don't know. You were just acting weird. I mean, I know you James, and that was new. Acting like what? Like you were trying to impress her or show off or something. You don't have to be jealous. Don't I? No, I asked you to marry me, remember? You got nothing to worry about. Promise? I promise. But there is something else you should worry about. What? How we're gonna plan this wedding. That's what I have to worry about? Oh yeah, it's gotta be perfect. Cool. Good. Let's go wedding planning. It's so beautiful in here. It is. Let's take a seat. Let's talk. To see two young people wanting to get married in love and loving the Lord. I happy for you both. At least you're happy for us. I don't know if our parents are. Your parents are aware that you wanna get married right? Yes, of course. He asked my parents permission before he asked me James, I'm proud of you. That takes courage. Thanks. I mean, they, they do support us and they will be here, but they just think we're too young and maybe we haven't thought this through enough. I've been married for nine years. Marriage is tough. Marriage is also one of the most important institutions in the world. It's not just about the beautiful day, parties and gifts. And those are nice. That's one day, followed by a lifetime of what will be hard work. We know that and we're ready for it. Well, I've watched you two mature and grow up and I'm proud of you and I be honored to marry you. You're ready. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. It means a lot. I've planned weddings for some of the most demanding people to ever walk God's green earth. Then you are the guy for me From Eleven Courses Catering, world-renowned chef at your disposal. I haven't thought about the menu. Then we've got a lotta work to do anything you want, we can do, wedding cakes too. You know, we work with Kupcakes & Co. You design it and we'll bring it to life. I do have a lotta work cut out for me. Well, we're here to help. Just don't leave me hanging. We can't have guests go hungry. Not at a wedding. Hungry guests will equal disaster. I do not want that. Listen, as long as you don't become a bridezilla, we should get along just fine. Don't worry. I don't have any time for that. Oh, I've seen it happen before. There was a sweet lady, kindergarten teacher, everyone loved her until she didn't get the flowers she wanted. She exploded. Wedding was called off. She lives alone in cave somewhere now, all alone. I don't want that to happen to you. I haven't thought about flowers. Or the menu. You want perfection? I can give you perfection, but you're going to have to work with me, especially if you want to Palm Sunday wedding. Yeah. Anything you want, name it, you got it. Commitment. That's a good thing to have right before getting married. That's what I'm talking about. What else are you talking about? Do you also want a perfect wedding? Hey James. Bethany, hey, hi! I like how she acts like she can't even see me. I can't wait to have a horse of my own one day. I had that same dream when I was your age. And it came true for you. Yeah, with Hope. It can come true for you too. So next event, cross country, right? So you've seen all the girls that you're competing against. How do you feel? Oh, well, I was confident, but now I'm not so sure. I'm thinking maybe throwing in the towel is the best way to go. Legacy wants to event. How do you know? When I was with her, she told me - Really? - There's no way I'm gonna let you not run. You're not gonna, you're not gonna. I mean, I don't know. I just, it's been so long since I've done any of this and I've got the wedding going on. It's just a lot. We're not gonna do this. We're not, we're not gonna have this conversation, okay? Would you be talking to your grandmother if she was here right now like this? No way, so don't do it to me. Okay. Well I guess I'm doing it. Yes. Yes, you can do it. Yeah, just gotta be better. You will be, baby. You really believe in me? - Of course. - Yes. Next event competition. Let's go, you're gonna be awesome. Let's do it. Let's do it. Go Lizzy, go Legacy! Come on, girlfriend you can do this, do it! Yes, yes! Go Lizzy, go Legacy, yes! Legacy looked happy out there. Her eyes sparkled. You could see that? Of course, she was happy excited, having the best time of her life. Yeah. I was like that when I first met her. It's like I looked into her eyes and I could see what she was thinking and she could see what I was thinking too. Can you still do that? I think so. So how'd you feel out there? It felt great. It was cross country. We were out there by ourselves. Cross country is definitely our best phase. But you didn't feel like that when you were doing dressage? No, Legacy definitely gets her dancing skills from me. And I've got two left feet. You can't dance? No, I am the worst at dancing. My prom date had to be taken away on a stretcher because I was stepping on his feet too much. Come on! No, I mean, it's true. It's like my ears hear the music but my feet just can't follow the beat. Okay, gotta put that last competition behind you, right? Gotta focus on right now. What's happening now, start all over again, okay? You're gonna be great. Hey, big boy. Wanna grab one of those brushes? Yeah, hey buddy. Let's go over this way. Hi. Hi baby. Back up, back up. Good boy. I love watching the two of you do this. You know, I have never had a pet in my life. Not even a dog, not 'til Hope, and I had to learn everything with him. His likes, his dislikes, and then when Legacy came along, it was the same thing all over again Well, you're doing a good job taking care of him. Have you ever been married before Linda? I wonder where that came from because your big day is right around the corner, right? Yeah. Yeah? Feeling a little nervous. Hailey, will you take over? Come with me. So what's going on? I don't know. I just been feeling a little nervous, thinking about everything. You can always change your mind. No, I'm being serious. Baby, marriage is a serious thing you know, but I think what you're going through is just feeling some cold feet. Don't worry about it, it's a natural thing. And yes, yes I have been married. He's not with us any longer, but I had 25 years of bliss. You know, ups and downs, but solid. He's been gone now about five years and every day I wake up expecting him to be somewhere in the house. I'm sorry. First 12 months after he died. I, every morning, I'd check out every single room in the house because I thought maybe I'd better double check. Maybe he's hiding someplace. You know, after all these years I still remember the moment that I said I do and that was even before he asked me to marry him. Marriage is just something pretty magical, isn't it? Oh baby, don't ever underestimate the power of love when two people come together like that. I don't, I guess that's why it's so scary. But great things are scary sometimes. That's why you just have to make sure that you're sure. I'm sure. You're sure? Yeah. Then there's nothing to worry about. Let's celebrate. Okay. You love James? I do more than I ever thought I could love anyone. That's what makes it so scary. It's not scary. It's a good scary. Okay, let's back up. You know, you guys coulda called us first. I know, sorry. It's okay, it's just that with everything going on right now, unexpected visits might not be the best idea. Well, we just wanted to see you and talk. Yeah, you guys can come over whenever. It's no big deal, really. First, we think you guys are crazy. Look, I'm not here to fight. I am desperate to be part of this wedding. Well, good. I just wanna say that we're here to help, whatever you guys need, however we can help, just name it and I'll do it just so I get to be there. Well, thanks mom. But Lizzy and I have already got it sorted. We shouldn't have been so against your decision. You're both adults. It's okay. It's not gonna be anything big. We're gonna keep it small and simple. Yeah, it's nothing too complicated. Well, it seems like lots of people already know about it. I mean, Bethany came by the house the other day looking for you. Yeah, I remember you guys hanging out in high school all the time. We haven't seen her lately, but I know you two were close. I don't think you can ask her to be your best man, but I'm willing to do the job if I get to do a speech using my dad jokes and all. I think we can consider that. Well, I've got great new material. Mom loves it. - No, no. - Yeah she does, she does. Well, he is- Losing weight, been workin' out. But every time he works out, he rewards himself with cake. Well, who's making the cake? You know your mom's cakes are fabulous. Oh, maybe I can make the wedding cake. I already have a caterer. Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be good though. You guys are gonna love them. It's tastes great. Can I get an apple? I'm on a diet. Do you want one? No thank you. She's in first place after dressage. I need to have a clean run at cross country and show jumping to move ahead. You'll be fine, Lizzy. You just perform like you practice. You'll be great. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you might be nervous, but Legacy isn't. You just gotta have hope. Yeah, there's just a lot more going on than that. Yeah, I mean you can just feel when somebody doesn't like you, you know? I just wanna stop. I mean, I just, what is this? What's going on? What do you mean? What do I mean is it's your turn soon! Get your head in the race. You said that the first time you competed it was disastrous. Let's not have the second time be that way too. Yeah. I'm trying. It doesn't sound like that to me, Lizzy. It really doesn't. You've gotta get your head straight. You've gotta start thinking clear and you've got to focus, please. Yeah, focus. All right, well I guess I gotta go saddle Legacy up. I'll focus. Back again? Yeah. You know, as the phases go on, it only gets harder. The mid-state eventing series is not for the fainthearted. Well, I'm not going anywhere so we're gonna be seeing a lot more of each other. Okay. Look, I know you don't like me- - I don't know you. Then why are you acting like I did something to offend you. What is it that you want from me? I don't want anything. I just don't understand why you keep acting so rude to me when you don't even know me. I don't know. But I do know James. And what's that supposed to mean? Your marriage to him won't work. Why would you say something like that? Because it's true. Well, you're wrong. No, I'm not. And you've also got no chance at beating me. Your horse is untalented and she should be left in a petting zoo, not in a competition. Well this just proves that you obviously don't know anything. I certainly know quite a bit about James. Feel kinda sorry for him. Well, you don't know him like I do and you never will. Believe me, I know James a lot better than you do. You're just jealous. That's what all this is about. See you out there. Good luck. I'm more than disappointed. I'm sorry. I felt good out there too. At least the first part You were doing so great. And you just lost your head. Right to the end and then you just gave up. I had stand out there and watch you fall apart. I tell ya, I'm ready to take off because there's no point in my being here to try and help you if you're not gonna go the extra mile out there. Actually, it doesn't matter who tries to help you if you're not gonna give extra effort out there. Do you realize you were this close to perfection and you let it all slip away because of some stupid rivalry. But- - No buts, no more buts. That girl is so jealous of you, she'll do anything she can to get under your skin and you're allowing it. You're letting her do it. You don't think I had things like that to face when I was riding? Of course I did. A lotta people do, but you've got to learn to rise above it. I had to learn to deal with it, so do you. Okay, let's get real. Is this really what you want? Yeah, I wanna finish it. I wanna do the third competition. I'm gonna see it through. Let's see it. So where am I supposed to go now? Get in, I'll drive you back. Okay. You were much better up there today. Did you see your time? You were much better than I thought you were gonna be. It's gonna make it much more interesting. And here I was thinking you were a joke rider. Look, I don't wanna argue with you so can you just leave me alone? I'm not here to fight. I'm here to talk. We tried that already. Can't say anything without insulting me, my fiance, or Legacy. There's one person who left out of that little list of yours. Who? Linda, saw you talking with her. She had a little girl. Yeah, that's her granddaughter. How well do you think you know her? Why? What's she doing with you? She's helping me. Is that why you were so much better today? I mean, you were awful in the first competition, but you did okay today. Suddenly Legacy isn't such a talentless horse after all, is she? Says you, but I'm suspicious. Well, I beat you so. How much do you think you know about Linda? Why do you keep asking about her? Because I know who she really is. So do a lotta people and it seems like you don't. What do you wanna say now? Linda isn't who you think she is. She's trouble. She shoulda kept herself hidden away and if you know what's good for you, you'll stay away from her. You just wanna insult everyone in my life, is that it? You don't know anything about her or anything else. You're just scared and jealous and people like you are bitter and twisted inside. You're just wasting your life being like this. Can't you see that? So just leave me alone. Why don't you do a little bit of research on her before you go tell me how wrong I am? Took it back anyways, got it fixed so we're gonna have, I think it's gonna be- - Hey James, I've been meaning to talk to you. Bethany. We should totally go for a coffee sometime. Actually, I was looking for Lizzy. Did you see her anywhere? Why are you marrying her? What do you mean? I mean, shouldn't you like be saying congratulations? No, not when I don't think you're right for each other. Wow, I mean, you're like the first person to actually say that. I'm just being honest. Well, to be honest, I'm kinda tired of everybody questioning my decisions. I was really hoping you'd be here today. I mean, of course I would be here. I'm here to support Lizzy. Why wouldn't I be? That's not what I meant. Look, I really missed you and I thought about you every day since high school Bethany, just stop, okay? Look, I wrote you this letter and I need you to read it. What is this about? Did I never tell you that I liked you? Bethany, I'm with Lizzy now, okay? We've been through a lot together. I'm sorry. Lizzy, hey, been looking all over for you. Seems like you're always talking to her. Those shared glances. What are you trying to say? Is there something going? With Bethany? No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Don't even. You've got nothing to worry about. Don't even think about Bethany. Well, she's my number one competition so I have to beat her if I want to win. Well, if she's your number one competition what you need to do is focus. You need to not- Just get her outta your mind and just focus on winning. That's what you gotta do. You can do this, okay? I believe in you. We're all here for you. You can beat her. Let's just go home. So much to plan. That's why you've got me here. Who woulda thought picking out flowers would be this hard. Well, here's your challenge for today. Not only do we need the flowers nailed down, we need the reception venue and everything that goes with it. Oh, if you'd only given me three things to focus on today, I would've struggled, but you've given me hundreds. From Luis Matchicau fabrics to the Nouvelle and Fairwinds. Well, you asked for perfection. Yeah, but at this rate, it's just gonna be me standing in the middle of the field, with a white t-shirt and jeans, nobody else. That's as much as I've got planned and the wedding's right around the corner Don't have a meltdown on me. I'm trying. Meltdowns are messy and I really don't do cleaning up. Just feel like that's the only decision I'm capable of making right now. Am I the only one not stressed out about this? That's because you've made less decisions than I have. And I've made barely any. You're making a big deal out of this, I mean, most of this stuff, these particulars don't bother me. Gee thanks. I'm serious, Lizzy. I mean the wedding that you want we're gonna make it happen, whatever we have to do, because it's all about you. I can give you two some space if that's what you need. No, I want you to see this. James, what kinda wedding do you want? The kind of wedding I want is as long as you're there, I'm there, and the pastor, then I'm happy And that's all? That's it. As long as you show up, then I don't have an idea of a picture perfect wedding, but I have an idea of a picture perfect bride. And that's you. That's so sweet. Decisions, Lizzy, we need to make decisions. So, what is it? Just wait until you see it. Now you're either gonna love it or you're gonna hate it. I don't know which, but I hope it's love. All right, ladies, I'll leave you to it, huh? What's going on? Well, I guess you're just gonna have to open the box and find out Mom! It's amazing. Honestly don't know what to say. There's something else inside. Take a look. Mom. Now, I know it's not much, but your dad and I wanna pay for your wedding. Now, you know how your father is. He won't even tip more than 10% in a restaurant but he really wants to do this too. So you know how serious we are. I don't know what to say. Just try on the dress before I- This part and then there's a little jacket that goes over it. It's really cute. And, veil! All right, hurry, try it on, try it on. Well, it almost fits. Well, I can alter it. I mean, I may not be the best seamstress in the world, but this I can do. Ah, my little girl is getting married! I'm gonna cry. That's the reaction I thought I was gonna get when I first told you. Oh stop. Don't say things like that. I was just a little concerned that you were getting married a little quickly, that's all. But seeing you in my dress, I just, oh, it's perfect. Well, hold that thought while I go get this sewing kit. Okay. Do you mind helping me? - I don't wanna get all caught- - Let me help you, sweetie. Just get that. Perfect. Thank you. This is always the hardest part. Awesome. That's all right, thanks. - You got it? - Yeah. All right. Hey wait. Whatever you do, don't let James see you in this dress. Oh, no worries. Got it. Hey Lizzy! Lizzy, where are you? Lizzy? Oh, there you are. What, did you get lost or something? Lizzy? Lizzy, what's wrong? Mom, I think it'd be best if you just go home. I need to take care of some things here. Honey, I'm not going anywhere till you tell me what's going on. Just a minute ago you were as happy as I've ever seen you and now look at you. I just need some time by myself, please. Honey, not until you tell me what's going on. I think we should call off the wedding. What? No, honey! No, I don't know what's going on here, but we both know that you do not wanna call this wedding off. Please just- - Honey, you and James both love each other. You could tell by the way you interact and in the way you look at each other when you think nobody's looking. Mom, just stop, stop, you don't know what's going on. Just leave, please. Sweetheart, I will respect that you don't wanna talk to me, right now but I want you to know whatever you need and whenever you're ready to say, that I'm right here for you. Honey. You don't understand. I don't, you're right, I don't understand. Please make me understand. I do not like seeing you like this. I can tell you're hurting. Please let me help you, honey. Honey, please. I don't know what to do. It's okay, honey. I'll always be here for you. What if he does love this other girl? I don't know what I'm gonna do. Hey, my friend, you gotta get ready. We got our next competition comin' up. I think Legacy will be perfect for your show jumping. Hey Linda, can I check something with you real quick? Sure, wait, wait, lemme see you. Have you been crying? Are you all right? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hailey, can you do me a favor and go check on Legacy for me? I've gotta talk to your grandma about some adult stuff. I'm not a little kid, you know. Yeah, I know, but I'm asking you as a friend. Really? Yeah, I wouldn't ask you if I didn't need it. What was the last time you evented? It's been awhile. Meet me up at the house. If I ask you a question, you'd tell me the truth, right? Come on, of course. Is this you? Yes. This article says that you're using drugs and steroids to make your horses perform better. Is that true? Is that how you got all those blue ribbons? No. But you were banned from eventing, right? Yes. Lizzy. Hey, you're back. Hey. Hey, what's going on? Lizzy! Can I talk to you? How can I believe anything that you have to say? Because I'm gonna tell you the truth. Okay, what's going on? Is that why Legacy did so well in the second competition? Of course not, it's because you two have worked so hard together, that's why. I can't believe anything that you're saying. I don't know if you're lying to me. I'm not a liar. I don't- - The newspaper article you read, that's about me and yes, I was banned from competing. So it is all true. None of it's true, none of it. Okay, I was about your age. I was riding. I was doing so well. I was earning medals. I was top of my game. I loved it. And I didn't do anything, I promise. Then why were you banned? Because I was horribly betrayed my best, my best friend. My trainer was injecting the horses with steroids so that they would run faster. I didn't know anything about it. When they found out, they banned him from training and then they banned me. Nobody would believe that I didn't know anything about it so I just, I packed it all in and I left the country. Why'd you come back? For the funeral. And then I met you. And I felt your heart, I felt your passion, I felt your fire. And it reignited mine. So I knew I had to stay and help you. Grandma, what's going on? It's okay, baby. This was just about me and my past and Lizzy needed to hear it. Look at me. I would never do anything to hurt Legacy or to disappoint you, never. Please don't send us away. I wanna help Legacy too. I love her. I really do. I'm not sending you away. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have got as upset as I did. You have every right to get upset, baby. You've got a lot going on now. You've got a lot on your plate right now. What are you doing? Waiting. No, I'm talking about the text messages and then the first thing I see you're doing is you're taking off your ring? I'm doing it for a reason. What reason could there possibly be? I think that we should put a pause on this wedding. A pause, no, no, there can be no pause. You said that much yourself. Well, there's going to have to be. You know, this is exactly what our parents- - This has nothing to do with what our parents have said. Then what does it have to do with? I've read that over and over again. Well, I haven't even read this once. I didn't ask for it. I didn't want it. Okay, I didn't open it and you shouldn't have either. Aren't you curious? No. You should have left it in the trash where it belonged. Why didn't you tell me that she'd given it to you? I don't know. I just want the truth. That's all I've ever wanted from anyone. I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. If nothing was going on, then nothing would hurt my feelings. Well nothing was going on. I am not gonna compete for you, James. And you're never gonna have to. - I will not be second best. - You're never gonna be. I've always felt like I need to compete for everyone's attention, even my parents' attention I felt like I had to compete to get them to notice me. But with you, it was different. I felt like I could be myself 100% of the time. And now I feel like you want me to be something that I'm not. I can't compete with someone else for you, James. What do you do- Where are you going? Are you leaving? I can't be here right now. You've got this all wrong. You kept this from me. Whatever's going on between you and Bethany, you tried to hide it. Just thought I was doing the right thing. Go. Come in. Hey sweetheart. How are you feeling this morning? Okay. I don't think I can go back to the ranch today though. If James is still there. Do you want me to talk to him for you? No, I might need you guys to go get me some clothes. I'm gonna stay here for a little while. I have some friends who can take care of Hope and Legacy for me. Just don't wanna see James right now. Sweetheart, you need to talk to him. I'm sure this is all just a big misunderstanding. You guys really think I should go back? Nope. Yes. Lizzy, when you're married to someone, you need to communicate with them. Now, I don't know what this letter said or who this girl is but I'm sure she's just trying to cause problems between you two for no reason. I'm sure James is just as confused as you are. The things she said, Mom. Well, you said James, didn't read the letter, right? Yeah, but why was he trying to hide it from me in the first place? Oh honey, I'm sure he just didn't wanna upset you. Exactly. Lizzy, no man wants the woman that he loves to be upset with him. When your mother and I got married, if I thought something was gonna upset her I tried to keep it nice and quiet. Inevitably, she always found out and inevitably- - And inevitably we both realized that it's better just to be open and honest with one another. Now had these little situations he'd been upfront with me, they never would've bothered me. But I mean, it took us a few years to figure that out, right? All life's lessons Lizzy, I would almost guarantee you that James thought he was trying to do the right thing by throwing away the letter. Granted, those letters should not have been in your house but Lizzy, you are marrying him for a reason. You love him and you trust him. And the fact that he didn't read those letters proves that he's the man that you know that he is. Oh, I know, marriage, Lizzy, it's scary. It's all about patience and trust and honesty. But honey, from what I've seen, James has always been honest with you. So you need to trust him. It'll all be worth it. Hey James. No hugs. You came here to see me right. I came here to talk to you. Then talk. You came here for a reason. It's for a reason you're not gonna like. James, you- - You shouldn't have written me this and I never should've taken it. And that's a mistake I'm here to fix. If it was a mistake, then why did you read it? I didn't read it. Then why is it open? I'm sorry if I gave you any indication that I had feelings for you, but I don't. I asked Lizzy to marry me, nobody else. I don't want it! Take it. I wrote it for you. Read it. Just take this! No. I hope you find someone. I really do, but it's not gonna be me. Now, honey I know you're not sick but I made you your special chicken curry pie. Dad, last time you made that for me, I was sick for like a week. Yeah, but now we know not to use the frozen chicken without the date on it, right? Yeah. Thanks. Dad, I've been thinking and, I'm sorry For what? I never thought about how you'd be feeling with Grandma's death and everything. I mean, she was your mom. I've just been so focused on myself and everything going on with my life. I didn't think about you. Kiddo, you don't have to apologize to me. I'm your father. I'm supposed to worry about your feelings but you do have a lot on your plate right now. I mean that ranch is a lot of work. Trust me, I know. I lived there. You sure you wanna do this? Are you sure you wanna keep it? Yeah, I mean, how could you ask me that? It's my home. I love it. Well, yeah, it's my home too. But nobody'd blame you if you sold it. It'd be a nice little nest egg for you to getting started in life. Dad, I know the ranch isn't your dream for my life. Definitely wasn't your dream for you, but it's my home now. I'm gonna do whatever it takes to keep it going. Okay. Well, I guess grandma left to the right person, huh? I think she knew what she was doing. Eat all that. I checked the date on it, I promise. All right Lizzy. What are you doing here? I need you to come back to the ranch. Why? Because I wanna marry you. What about Bethany? Bethany, who cares about her? I don't. She means nothing to me. And the letter? I destroyed it like I should've done in the first place. Why? Because I love you, Lizzy. Isn't it obvious? The wedding's only a week away? It is and I will be at that church waiting for you. Lizzy, all I can think about, all I can dream about is being together with you. I cannot envision myself in any other way than being with you. So what kinda wedding you got planned? I haven't got that far yet but I was hoping I could get a little help. You know I couldn't leave to plan a wedding by yourself, even with Emmett's help. No, that's why I need you beside me. To hold your hand? That would be nice. Are you sure you really wanna do this? I haven't hesitated yet. I'm not about to. I will be there at the church waiting to hear you say I do. How's Legacy? Legacy? You've only been gone for like a day. I know, but I miss her and Hope. Well, why don't you come back to the ranch and find out. I'm sure they'd be happy to see you too. Okay. Hello. Hi. Lizzy! Well, honestly, there was a part of me that wondered if I would ever see you again. Of course you would. Never know. I just had to, you know, takes some space to, you know, clear my head and figure things out 'cause it was just a lot. But I feel better now. Good, how about some lemonade? We go inside. No, I don't have time. I gotta focus on the next event. That's why I came here 'cause I need you guys. It's show jumping and I haven't done it in a long time. I think we've had this conversation before, Lizzy. Yeah, but it's different this time. How? It's not just about me and Legacy winning anymore. 'Cause I wanna clear your name. You wanna what? I don't know how, but everybody just needs to know that you're not a cheat, you know? And I feel like this event could do that. That's so nice and I really appreciate it, but no, I don't think I wanna put you through that. I am definitely up for the challenge. That's a big challenge. It's worth it. I mean, you've been helping out so much and I haven't been doing as much as I could have. So you were right to criticize me but it's all different now. I'm more focused and it's not, it's not about me anymore. It's about you guys. It's so much more. You don't need me for that. I can't show jump without Legacy but I definitely can't finish this without you. You're competing against her again, right? - Yeah. - Okay. You'll be fine. I mean, this is her whole life. It's all she does. It seems like I'm never gonna not compete against her. Okay, come on. I need you to get your head together. Be ready, okay? I'm ready. Somehow I believe that. I just have a feeling that you're gonna be amazing. This is gonna happen. I can count on you this time. It's for you and Legacy this time so it's different. Lizzy, you're the best here. We'll be cheering you all the way. Thanks. Yeah, no more coming in second place. Only by winning this thing can I really prove how great of a horse Legacy is. And for you too, Lizzy. You're great rider. I don't want you to forget that. Go on and show 'em what you can do, baby. Hey. Look, I'm not interested in anything you have to say. I'm just focusing on my jumps. I wanna make you an offer. What could you possibly offer me? Let me win. Forfeit, take your horse and go home and you never have to see me again. What? This means more to me than it does to you. You know that, right? You don't know anything. This isn't just about me proving you wrong anymore. Let me win or you'll regret it. No deal. You can't bully me anymore. I'm only gonna make this offer once. Well, my answer isn't gonna change. You have no power here so you can't bully me. Oh no? Yeah, you know, I'm sorry you thought you could steal my life, but it's mine. So get your own. Come on! There's only one thing that I wanna say. This belongs to Linda Locke just as much as it belongs to me. Some of you might think you know her past, but you couldn't be more wrong. I couldn't have done this without her and I can never be thankful enough. I'd like to welcome you to the wedding of James and Elizabeth. But before we begin, I'd like to talk to you about what I shared with them in counseling. We talked about life. We talked about relationships. Love comes easy, struggling with what happens on the day to day is gonna be the hardest. You're gonna get the best of each other and you're gonna get the worst of each other. Your marriage must be first rooted in the Lord. Are you ready? Yes. Are you ready? Yes. All right, let's do this. Do you, James Mifflin, take Elizabeth to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part? I do. Do you, Elizabeth, take James to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part? I do. You both have the rings. You're doin' great. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Ready? - I can't believe it. - Unbelievable. So how did we do? You guys did great. I've never been happier in my life. Well here's to your health and a long happy marriage full of love. Best wishes to the bride. - Congratulations to the groom. - Yes sir. Thank you. I'm gonna teach you how to ride just like my grandma taught me. Could I ever be as good as you one day? You'll be better. Are you ready? Yes. I can't believe I'm actually doing this. You're looking good out there. Oh yeah! Okay, let's go. Yes! - You go girl. - Wow. So proud of you. - Huh? - Yeah.
