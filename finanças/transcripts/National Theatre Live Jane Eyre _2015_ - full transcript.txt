You were supposed to be outside with the other children Well? Have you anything to say for yourself? What have I done, Aunt Reed? - I do not like questioners, Jane Until you learn to behave like a happy, contented mild... ...then I must exclude you from the privileges enjoyed by the others Tiresome child. off with you.

Bessie, I saw a light and I thought a ghost had come What is all this? Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre was to be left in the Red Room until I came to her myself But she screamed out so loud. ma'am She has screamed out on purpose. I mow her tricks Loose Bessie's leg. child. You cannot succeed in getting out by these deceitful means, be assured You will now stay in here an hour longer Please. Aunt Reed. have pity on me. Have mercy. Have mercy Silence! This violence is almost repulsive. Bessie! Lock the door in the days I went a-dancing No thought of care or woe The lads and {asses in their best A fang time ago It's right nice outside, you know. John and the girls have gone out I mow. I could go and fetch you one of them books Come on, Miss Jane, weer yourself up. When's all this going to end? All this crying. it will do you no good I cry because I am miserable. Bessie - Miserable? You've nowt to be miserable for Mrs Reed's done you a great service taking you in. You ought to be thankful for your good fortune It's unjust Perhaps you should learn to keep your passions under control Try to think of good things - There are no good things I don't know what's to be done with you. You'll end up in the poorhouse: how would you like that? I shouldn't like to be a beggar and have no fire and no shoes I've heard that Mrs Reed's making enquiries about sending you to school School? Do you remember those young ladies I told you about from that last family I worked for? They went to school. They could embroider. and translate from the French And play piano? And paint watercolours? But most importantly. they learned how a young lady should behave It's not easy, mind you. They have these backboards to help you sit up straight, and if you don't do as your told you get the slipper I shouldn't mind the punishment if it were fair Perhaps school will suit your temper. then. Now come on. make yourself useful This is the little girl whom I should like you to find a place for Her size is small. What is her age? - Ten years So mum? And what is her parentage? She is an orphan. Her father was a clergyman: he died of an infection whilst living amongst the poor Her mother, my husband's sister, followed soon after That is the price you pay for marrying below yourself What is your name, mild? - Jane Eyre, sir Well, Jane Eyre. Are you a good mild? Come here Do you mow where the wicked go after death? To hell, sir - And what is hell? A burning pit of fire Should you like to be falling into that pit and be forever burning? No, sir - Then what must you do to avoid it? I must keep in good health and not die And how will you do that? Children younger than you die daily I buried a mild of five years old a day or two since, a good little girl, whose soul is now in heaven it is to be feared the same could not be said of you should you be called hence Do you read your Bible? - Sometimes Are you fond of it? I like Revelation. and some bits of Kings and Chronicles. and Job and Jonah And the Psalms? I hope you like them? - The Psalms are not interesting Mr Brocklehurst, should Jane be admitted to Lowood... ...I would ask that the staff there all guard against her worst fault: a tendency to deceit Deceit? Deceit is indeed a sad fault in a child All liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone. She shall be watched I wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects, to be made useful and to be kept humble Plain fare. simple attire. unsophisticated accommodation. hardy and active habits Sum is the order of the day at Lowood I will send her as soon as possible As for the vacations. she will. with your permission. spend them always at Lowood That request can be accommodated. ma'am Little girl. here is a book entitled 'A Child's Guide'. I penned it myself Read it daily with prayer. especially 'An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha...'

I should say that I loved you: but I declare I do not love you This book about the liar. you may keep it yourself. for it is you who tells lies. and not I Jane. what is the matter with you? I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live I will never come to see you when I am grown up, and if anyone ever asks me how I liked you and how you treated me, I shall say the very thought of you makes me sick and that you treated me with miserable cruelty How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre! How dare I, Mrs Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth You think I can do without one bit of love or kindness. but I cannot live so I shall remember to my dying day how you thrust me back into the Red Room. though I cried out with distress And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy knocked me down for nothing Send me to school soon, Mrs Reed, for I hate to live here I will indeed send you to school. I will indeed Miss Jane? Miss Jane! Where is she now? As if I've got time to be looking all over the house for her You naughty little thing. Why don't you come when you're called? Come.

And she said I need not disturb her in the morning. and to remember... ...that she had always been my best friend. and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly And what did you say, Miss? Nothing. I hid beneath the bedclothes and turned my face to the wall That was wrong, Miss Jane No. Bessie. it was quite right. Your Missis has not been my friend: she has been my foe How coolly my little lady talks! I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it to me I'll kiss you and welcome...

I don't have any parents - How long have they been dead? Since I was a baby - And how old are you now? Ten years old - Can you read and write and sew a little?

Kyrie What is God? - God is the supreme spirit Where is God? - God is everywhere What was the sin committed by Eve? The sin committed by Eve was the sin of temptation What is sin? - Sin is an offence against God Girls! File out! You may be seated Eyre, come and sh here behind King. Bums, stop daydreaming Right. thread your needles and knot the tail end We are doing blanket stitch. a quarter of an inch from the edge SR up straight. King! (SLAP) Sloppy work, Bower. Take it out and start again Burns! Focus on the task in hand! (SLAP) ls your book interesting? I like it What's it about? You may look at it What is your name, besides Bums? - Helen Do you come from a long way from here? I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland Will you ever go back? - I hope so. But nobody can be sure of the future Why is this place called Lowood Institution? Why not Lowood School? We're all charity children. All the girls here have lost either one or both parents. And they call this an Institution for educating orphans Do they keep us for nothing? - Our families pay fifteen pounds a year Fifteen pounds? Then why do they call us charity children? Because fifteen pounds is not enough And the rest is paid by generous ladies and gentlemen of Mr Brocklehurst's parish So you're an orphan? - My mother's dead How long have you been here? - Two years Are you happy here? - You ask rather too many questions I have given enough answers for the present. Now I want to read Thus concludes our chapter on the execution of King Charles the First. Who was listening? Well. let's see. shall we? When was King Charles executed? Hayes? 1649, ma'am - Vague. More detail King? - January... ma'am... Do not put your hand up unless you know the answer Bums? - Tuesday January 30th 1649, ma'am And where was he executed? Outside the banqueting hall at the Palace of Whitehall. ma'am And what were his final words? 'Therefore I tell you that I am a martyr of the people. I have a good cause and a gracious God on my side' Eyre. fetch the rod from the cupboard Burns. you dirty. disagreeable girl. You never scrubbed your nails this morning Hayes! Hardened girl. Nothing can mend your slatternly habits Is it the same book? Yes, and I have just finished it You must wish to get away from this place Why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education. And it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object But that teacher was so cruel to you - Not at all. She is severe. she dislikes my faults I should resist her if she struck me with that rod. I should get it from her and break it under her nose Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr Brocklehurst would expel you It is far better to endure patiently a smart whim nobody feels but yourself... ...than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences extend to all those connected to you You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very good Then learn from me not to judge by appearances I am. as the teacher said. slatternly. I seldom put. and never keep. things in order I am careless. I forget rules. I read when I should learn my lessons That is curious. It is so easy to be careful For you. I have no doubt that it is Your thoughts never seem to wander. Mine continually rove away Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland and the noises I hear... ...are the sound of a bubbling little brook that runs through Deepden near our house And when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be wakened and I have no answer ready This is all very provoking to Miss. who is naturally neat. punctual and particular And cross and cruel. And you're so good. Helen Yes. in a passive way. but there is no merit in such goodness Yes, there is. You are good to those who are good to you if you were good to all the wicked people. then the cruel people would have it all their own way So we should strike bad! - No. I cannot believe that I hold another creed. which no one ever taught me and I seldom mention. but which I delight in and cling to With this weed, revenge never worries my heart and injustice never crushes me too low I don't understand Helen Bums, if you don't go and put your drawer in order and fold up your work this minute... ...I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it We are all burdened with faults in this world. Love your enemies. Jane. and bless them that curse you How should you finish the day? I should finish the day by kneeling down and saying my prayers After your night prayers, what should you do? After my night prayers I should observe due modesty in going to bed, occupy my self with thoughts of death. And endeavour to compose myself to rest at the foot of the Cross... ...and give my last thoughts to my crucified Saviour My plan in bringing up you girls is not to accustom you to habits of luxury and indulgence... ...but to render you hardy. patient and self-denying I have had reports that there have been occasions when your porridge has been burned This should not be seen as the spoiling of a meal, but an opportunity to muse upon the sufferings of early Christian martyrs Careless girl! Let the child who dropped her book step forward Ah, Jane Eyre. I have a few words to say regarding you Stool Place yourself upon it, child No, I wish you to stand You all see this girl? My dear children. I must warn you that this little girl is a castaway. Not of the true flock but evidently an interloper and an alien You must be on your guard against her You must shun her example. avoid her company and exclude her from your sports. Because this girl is a servant of the Evil One! This little girl... is a liar Let her stay on the stool. and let no one speak to her for the remainder of the day My feet may are a-weary My limbs may are a-sore I have travelled across this land so far How long I can't be sure Here. Eat it Why do you stay with a girl who everybody believes to be a liar? Everybody? Eighty girls have heard you so called, and the world contains hundreds of millions Those eighty, I know, despise me Probably no one despises you. Many I am sure pity you But how can they pity me after what Mr Brocklehurst said? Mr Brocklehurst is not a God if the whole world hated you while your own conscience absolved you from guilt... ...you would not be without friends November... December... January... February... March. March. April... May... June, June... June How is Helen Bums? - She is very poorly, mild What did the doctor say about her? - We must all pray for her Can I go and see her? - No. child. The sick bay is out of bounds Helen? Are you awake? What are you doing here. Jane? It's past eleven o'clock I came to see you, Helen. I heard you were very ill You've come to bid me goodbye, then Are you going home? - Yes, to my last home No! Jane. it's cold. Come and cover yourself with my quilt I'm very happy, Jane. And when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve There is nothing to grieve about We all must die some day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful Do you know where you're going, Helen? Can you see? I am going to God - Where is God? What is God? Besides this Earth there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits It's everywhere. and those spirits watch over us So will I see you again, Helen, when I die? You will come to the same region of happiness, no doubt I feel as ill could sleep. But don't leave me, Jane, I'd like to have you near me I'll stay with you, and nobody shall take me away Goodnight, Jane - Goodnight, Helen Christ with me... Christ before me Christ behind me Good morning. children.

Encore une fois - 1649 And what were the final words of the King? Saunders? 'Therefore I tell you that I am a martyr of the people. I have a good cause and a gracious God on my side' Encore une fois - Je suis, Tu es, il est, Elle est... Oh, Edwards, please don't wipe your nose on your sleeve. It is a bit cold in here though, isn't it?

Those blue peaks I must have liberty. And if I cannot have liberty then I must have mange Grant me at least a new servitude. Think! Think! Think! - What can I do? I can get a new place. with new people. under new circumstances Why do I want this? - Because it is of no use wanting anything better But how do people gel a new place? - They apply to friends, I suppose I have no friends Plenty of people have no friends - What do they do? Advertise... as a governess I must advertise in the Yorkshire Herald 'To JE who advertised in the Herald last Thursday' 'A situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl under ten years of age' The salary is thirty pounds per annum' - Dinner 'JE is requested to travel at her earliest convenience' Tea - 'Mrs Fairfax, Thornfield Hall' Goodbye, Lowood First stop Rockwith, Bramhope, Methley, (watch your bags!)

But Thornfield Hall is just down the way Ow! Fuck! Fuck this fucking place! Are you injured, sir? - Just stand to one side! Is there anything I can do to help? - You can be on your way Pilot! Pilot, get off me I cannot think of leaving you here at this late hour in this solitary lane... ...until I see you are fit to mount your horse Necessity compels me to make you useful. Come here... stand there You will have to tum Whoa! Easy, easy... There we go I'm obliged to you. Pilot, away!

Welcome to Thornfield - Mrs Fairfax? Yes indeed. Come and stand by the fire, get yourself warm Ooh, your coat is soaked. Let me take it from you Can I get you anything? Something to eat, perhaps? - No, thank you What a journey you must have had! All that way in the frost and the snow I am glad you are come Sometimes one can feel very alone, rattling around these empty corridors of a nighttime C'est Elle, ma gouvernante? - Bonsoir. Tu es encore debout? Vous parlez français! Adella! You are supposed to be asleep - Je Ne suis pas fatiguée Off to bed with you, now! - Jusqu'à demain, mademoiselle She has a few words of English but I have the devil of a job to get her to use them You must be exhausted. Let me show you to your room Aye, Thornfield is a fine old hall, though very much neglected of late in Mr Rochester's absence Who is Mr Rochester? - Why. he's the owner. Did you not mow? I thought Thornfield belonged to you? To me? Bless you, mild, what an idea. No, I'm only the housekeeper And the mild? My pupil? Adella is Mr Rochesters ward. He brought her over from France at the end of last summer Such a shame he spends so much time on the continent Great houses require the presence of their proprietors Here we are, my dear. I do hope you'll be comfortable I've put you in one of the smaller rooms. The large apartments at the front are so sombre And your fire's kept in. Good Your window looks out over the garden. with a wonderful view from the battlements... ...Rochester land as far as the eye can see ls Mr Rochester well respected? He is a good master. Somewhat peculiar perhaps. though not strikingly so My room is along the corridor: you just knock if you need anything. Goodnight, Miss Eyre Mrs Fairfax! Mrs Fairfax! Good morning. my dear. What is it? - I heard something... like a laugh Probably one of the servants. Grace Poole, very likely Did you hear it? I often hear her. She sews in one of the rooms on the third floor She sometimes has one of the maids in to assist her, and they can be very noisy together Too much noise. Grace. Remember directions Now. time for you to meet your pupil properly As Miss Adella's governess... ...you will be responsible for teaching her all the accomplishments expected of a modern young lady Of course, improving her English is a priority But she must also be able to dance, and do fine needlework, and play piano In the evenings, after she is in bed, you may sit with me in the parlour And on Sundays we all attend church together Now. Adele. in our lessons we will always speak English. We'll start with numbers... Je Ne comprends pas We'll start with numbers and then we'll move on to simple nouns. like animals Parlez français! Then we will combine them as follows: one (rat, two dogs, three pigs and so on Je Ne comprends pas! One, two, three, four, five... - Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq! Oh, I see you do understand En Français!... - English... Oh well, never mind, we'll try again another day Goose - Geese Goose - Geese Many geese. Honk honk - Well done, Adele Les derniers mots du roi furent 'J'ai une bonne cause et un Dieu bienveillant de man côté' Très bien I cannot understand a word she says when she runs on so I am learning the kings of England - History? What does a young lady need with that? Must we do sewing again? - What else would a young lady do of an evening? She was young, wildfire eyes a-gleaming Cast on the Western wind By the hands of love she was bound and blinded To her final end Who stole your crown While your back was turned? Bow your head down While your body slowly burns I cannot do it. I have made a knot again - Give it here She's tired, I'll see to her. Another day done I should be happy - I know I should I should be content - Adèle is a good pupil Mrs Fairfax has a kind heart - I know I should not be restless it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity. We must have action Women are supposed to be very calm, generally - Women feel just as men feel They need exercise for their faculties and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do Must I confine myself to making puddings and embroidering cushion covers? I wish to exercise my mind. I wish to be allowed freedom Miss! Miss Jane, you'll have to see to Adella yourself The master has returned without a word of warning. his bed's not made up and Cook's got nothing in Is this Mr Rochester's dog? Aye, and he's a blooming nuisance. Pilot! Out! Come on! You know Master wants to see you and Adella in the drawing room after dinner tomorrow evening Come on, out of it, Pilot! You? - May I introduce Miss Eyre Good evening, sir You're Adele's governess? - Yes. sir Do you two mow each other? Yes, Mrs Fairfax. This woman leapt out at me on Hay Lane and felled me from my horse I hope there were no bones broken, sir Out! Bonsai Monsieur Rochester' It's 'good evening', Adèle. 'Good evening', not 'bonsoir. You're not in bloody Paris any more Good evening. Mister Rochester - Better Excuse me. sir. est-ce Que vous avez un cadeau pour moi? No, I have not brought you a present - Et pour Miss Eyre aussi? Well, Miss Eyre, did you expert a present'! Are you fond of presents? I believe they are generally thought pleasant things Generally thought? What do you think? - I have very little experience of them. sir You are more sophisticated than Adele. She demands her present. you beat about the bush That is because I have less confidence in my deserts than she does Don't fall bad! on over-modesty! I have examined Adele: she is not bright, she has no talents... ...yet Mrs Fairfax tells me that in a short time she has made much improvement There, sir, you have now given me my cadeau it is the meed teachers most covet: praise of their pupil's progress Humbug! Take a seat You have been in my house for three months. Where did you come from? Lowood institution - Who are your parents? I have none None? So were you waking for your people as you sat on that stile? For whom, sir? - The men in green When you leapt out at me on Hay Lane that night I thought unaccountably of fairy tales Did I break through one of your fairy rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway? The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago, sir And not even in Hay Lane or the fields about it might you find a trace of them I don't think either summer or harvest or winter moon will ever shine on their revels more Adele showed me your portfolio this morning. Are these paintings all your own work'? I should think a master aided you - No, indeed Well. that pricks pride. Where do your ideas come from? From my head From that head I see on your shoulders? - Yes They are weird. The thoughts are elfish Were you happy when you painted these? - As happy as I have ever been Put the drawings away What are you about. Miss Eyre? It's gone nine o'clock. Take Adele to bed Adèle, come Bonne nuit Good evening, sir Mrs Fairfax? I thought you said Mr Rochester was not strikingly peculiar Well, is he? - He seems very chngeful and abrupt I am so used to his manner I never think of it if he has peculiarities of temper. allowance should be made Why'? - He has painful thoughts that make his spirits unequal What about'! - Family troubles I thought he had no family - Not now, but he has had He broke with them long ago. some misunderstanding with his father Mr Rochester is not very forgiving One times two is two, two times two is four, three times two is six, four times two is eight Five times two is ten. six times two is... twelve Seven times two is... fourteen. eight times two is... sixteen Very good, Adèle. That will do for today Sir? - I see you can count as well as paint, Miss Eyre You have discovered my only other talent. sir - Modesty again? I thought we had done away with that Old habits are hard to break Adèle!... Adèle! - Qu'est-ce qu'il y a? I have something for you - Quoi? La boîte? C'est pour moi? Yes. Take it away and disembowel it. but do it quietly - Merci, Mr Rochester. Merci! J'adore le cadeau! Mrs Fairfax! Take her to the nursery and make sure that she doesn't bother me Miss Eyre. pull up your chair Here, where I can see you You examine me, Miss Eyre. Do you think me handsome? - No, sir There is something singular about you You sit there sewing away in silence and then you come out with a comment like that Forgive me sir, I was too plain - Yes, you were I should have said something like: beauty is of little consequence You should have said no sum thing It was just a blunder, sir - It was, and you shall answer fork Criticise me. Find fault with me. Does my forehead not please you? You look puzzled, Miss Eyre And while you are no more pretty than I am handsome, a puzzled air becomes you: so puzzle on I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative tonight, so we are going to have a conversation. Now speak What about. sir? - Anything you like You are dumb, Miss Eyre. Stubborn I am willing to amuse you if I can, sir, but how will I know what will interest you? You ask me questions. I will do my best to answer them Fine. But as I have roamed half the globe while you have lived quietly in a corner. Don't you think that I have a right to be somewhat masterful, abrupt even, without you being piqued or hurt by my tone of command? Do as you please, sir - That is not an answer The smile is very well, but speak too I was merely thinking that very few masters would concern themselves... ...as to whether their paid subordinates felt piqued or hurt by their tone of command Paid subordinates? I pay your salary, don't I? Well, on that mercenary ground then, ill dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases, you won't think that their omission arises from insolence? I should never mistake informality for insolence. sir One I rather like: the other nothing freeborn would submit to. even for a salary Humbug. Most things freeborn would submit to anything for a salary But perhaps you are an exception I don't mean to flatter you, Miss Eyre. It is no merit of yours. Nature did it You may yet prove to have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points We are all burdened by faults in this world, sir I was set on the wrong track at the age of twenty-one and have never recovered the right course since On the whole, nature meant me to be a good man I am not. Not that I am a villain. just a sinner: a trite commonplace sinner You must wonder that I tell you this? You have a peculiar mind. You listen to me with an innate sense of pity Qu'elle est belle! Merci pour ma belle robe! Ça me Va bien? Qu'est-ce Que Je suis magnifique! Mrs Fairfax, I told you to keep her out Adèle! Adèle, get out! You too, dog! Go on, out! Do you think she resembles me? I could not say, sir I have a past existence, a series of deeds that I daily regret Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre. Remorse is the poison of life Repentance is said to be its cure. sir Her mother insisted she was mine I see no proof in her countenance. Pilot is more like me than she is Celine Varens was her name: an opera dancer. She abandoned the child and ran away with a singer You never felt jealousy. did you. Miss Eyre? I need not ask. because you have never felt love Now you mow the child is a French dancer's bastard. You will perhaps think differently of your position here? Not at all, sir. Now that I know she was abandoned by her mother and disowned by you, I shall cling more closely to her than before I like this night. I like Thornfield, with its old crow trees and lines of dark windows How long have I hated the very thought of this place, I've shunned Mike some great plague house I Mo'! like it! I dare like it! I will break any obstacles to happiness. to goodness I wish to be a better man than I have been, I wish to be a better man than I am Strange that I moose you as a confidante in this You listen as if it were the most natural thing in the world... ...for a man like me to tell tales of his opera mistress to his young governess I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the dose-set bars of a cage A vivid. restless. resolute captive is there: were it but free. it would soar cloud-high You fear me because I talk like a sphinx No, sir, I am certainly not afraid Goodnight, Miss Eyre That was an unexpected evening. He talked a lot A lot... He talked a lot... to me why? He said I was a good listener - I am a good listener I think he was just drunk - He was definitely drunk But he did say I have a peculiar mind - Is that good? Is peculiar good? - No, peculiar's not good He's peculiar - He's definitely peculiar I will like it. I dare like it Deep in the burning ice Lies a flame Who's there? Who's there? Sir! Sir, wake up! Sir, get out of bed! I heard someone laughing in the corridor. Someone is trying to hurt you. Shall I fetch Mrs Fairfax? Mrs Fairfax'? No, she will wake the entire house Jane, I have to leave you for a few moments. If you are cold, take my coat Should I not come with you. sir? - No. stay here. Don't move or call out until I return I have found it all out. It is exactly as I thought The laughter in the corridor... you will have heard something like it before, I should think? Yes, sir. There is a woman who sews on the third floor. Grace Poole. She laughs in that way Grace Poole. Just so She is strange, sir, I don't think you should keep her in the house You are no talking fool. Jane. Say nothing more about it. You ought to go to bed Goodnight then. sir You are leaving me already? You said I might go, sir You save my life, then you walk away from me as if we were mere strangers At least shake me by the hand I have the pleasure of owing you an immense debt, Jane There is no debt, sir, there is no obligation of any kind I knew you would do me good in some way. I saw it in your eye that first time we met I am glad I happened to be awake Goodnight again, sir Good morning. Grace - Miss A strange affair - Indeed. Miss May I ask. are you in the habit of bolting your door at night? I am not. but in future I shall make sure I bolt my door securely before I venture to lie down it might be wise to do so. Miss - it might be wise for Mr Rochester to do the same Well. when he returns you can advise him so yourself I did not know he was out He is gone to Lord and Lady Ingram's: he's not expected back for a fortnight. Good morning, Miss Mrs Fairfax! Mrs Fairfax! We are back, soaked to the skin and hungry A few more than expected, I'm afraid Mrs Fairfax! Bring some hot tea to my room, please. I'll catch my death in these wet things I'd forgotten how splendid Thornfield is The piano has not moved since your last visit. Blanche - Then you will sing and I shall play for you - Al a command from you, I am all obedience Enchantée mademoiselle Edward, who is this? May I introduce my ward, Adèle Varens - What a poppet of a child Adèle, Miss Ingram - Bonjour! And her governess. Miss Eyre - Sir. good evening I had half a dozen governesses when I was a child. The word itself is enough to make me feel nervous You should send the child to school - I have not considered the subject You men never do. Now... Are you in good voice tonight, Signor Eduardo? Signor Eduardo? Why, Miss Ingram, you make me sound like a Spanish mercenary A Spanish mercenary would suit me fine Mrs Fairfax. I was not aware that Mr Rochester could sing He only sings in the company of other ladies and gentlemen That Blanche Ingram: voice of an angel You. a favourite of Mr Rochester? - You. gifted with the power of pleasing him? You, of importance to him in anyway? - Listen then, Jane Eyre, and look Draw in chalk your own picture without softening one defect Write under it: 'Portrait of a governess, disconnected, poor and plain' Mad about the boy I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy I'm so ashamed of it but must admit The sleepless nights I've had about the boy Will it ever cloy? This odd diversity of misery and joy I'm feeling quite insane and young again And all because I'm mad about the boy Lord knows I'm not a fool girl I really shouldn't care Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl in the fury of her first affair Now take a piece of the finest parchment - Mix your freshest, dearest, brightest tints And paint carefully the loveliest face you can imagine Write under it: 'Blanche Ingram. an accomplished lady of rank' Whenever in the future you should chance to fancy that Mr Rochester thinks well of you... ...take out these pictures and compare them So if I could employ A little magic that will finally destroy This dream that pains me and enchains me But I can't because I'm mad... Mad about the boy A more fantastic idiot than Jane Eyre has never lived Pardon me, madam, for the late hour. I am an old friend of Mr Rochester's: I was hoping to see him He is in the drawing room. He has guests Shall I take you to him? - No. I have no wish to disturb the party If you would be so kind as to inform him that a Mr Mason is here. From Spanish Town in Jamaica I'll fetch him Jane! - Good evening, sir Why did you not come and speak to me in the drawing room? I did not wish to disturb you, sir, as you seemed engaged And what have you been doing during my absence? - Teaching Adele, as usual You didn't catch cold that night you dragged me out of bed? Not the least Return to the drawing room, you are deserting too early - I am tired, sir And a little depressed - I am not depressed There is a man who's come to see you. I have left him in the hall He's from Spanish Town in Jamaica. His name is Mason Mason? W“? Oh God! Sir? Sir? Are you ill, sir? I wish I were on a quiet island with only you, Jane. Trouble and danger on the far side of the world What can I do? Edward? Richard! Let's get you a drink, warm you up Jane! Are you up? You must come with me to the third floor You don't turn sick at the sight of blood? - I don't think so, sir Mason! How are you, Mason? - She's done for me, I fear Bear up, man! You thought you were dead as a herring a moment ago, and now you're all up and talking She bit me. She worried me like a tigress when you took the knife off her I warned you not to come up here without me, didn't I? - I thought it would do some good Well it hasn't, has it? But you are not dying. I shall go for the surgeon What about her? - What more would you have me do? Jane, try to stop him bleeding, but under no circumstances speak to this man Richard. speak to this woman on peril of your life. Do you understand? I can rely on you, Jane? - Yes, sir Mason! The surgeon's here The fresh air revives me - Open the windows on his side You must take care of her. Treat her as tenderly as may be I do my best. I have done it and I will do it. Driver! Go on! Yah! You've passed a strange night, Jane - Yes, sir Mason will be halfway to Liverpool by now And the danger you spoke of, sir: is that gone too? Not until he is out of the country. Perhaps not even then Grace Poole must be sent away from the house, sir. Your life is in danger while she remains To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on the crater crust, which may crack and spew fire at any time Then speak to Mason. sir. Tell him he must avert the danger Jane... Suppose you were a wild indulged boy in a foreign land There you commit a capital error. Mind. I do not say 'crime': my word is 'error' Over time, the results of what you have done become utterly insupportable You are desperate. You seek happiness in heartless, sensual pleasures Finally you come home. You make a new acquaintance You find in this stranger all the bright qualifies you have sought for twenty years You feel better days come back. You wish to recommence your life To attain that end, are you justified in overleaping a mere conventional impediment? Is this man justified in daring the world's opinion in order to attach himself forever to this gentle stranger? A sinners reformation should never depend on a fellow creature. sir if anyone you know has suffered or erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength and solace But the instrument! The instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the instrument I believe I have found the instrument for my cure Little friend. you may perhaps have noticed my penchant for Miss Ingram Don't you think that if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance? You look quite pale. Jane. You must curse me for disturbing your rest Curse you? No, sir - Then shake my hand in confirmation of the word You have cold fingers When will you watch with me again? Whenever might be useful, sir - Perhaps the night before I am married I am sure I shan't be able to sleep. Do you promise to sit up with me and talk of my lovely one? To you I can talk of her, for you have seen her and you know her She's a rare one, is she not, Jane? - Yes, sir She's a strapper... she's a real strapper The house will be awake soon. You'd best go in by the shrubbery In the days I went a-dancing Nor thought of care or woe The lads and lasses in their best A long time ago The breeze did blow the blossom down The green leaves died away The echoing cry of a crow on the wing Told me I could not stay My feet may are a-weary My limbs may are a-sore I have travelled across this land so far How long I can't be sure The mountains stand before me The rivers running wild The wind it howls, the rain it falls Upon this orphan child
