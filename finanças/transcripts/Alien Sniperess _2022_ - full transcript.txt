[upbeat music] [thrilling music] [meteors whooshing] [Radio Host] If you've been watching the news, you know there's a meteor shower tonight. Great chance for you to spend some time with your loved ones. So turn off your cell phones, turn off the damn lights and go enjoy this meteor shower. I'll be here playing the hits. Make sure you call in with your requests. [man sighs] Hey, babe. If we leave right now, we can make it to Lookout Point. I have this whole night planned out, and you're set in stone on staying here. Yeah, I mean, look at the view. Come on, I just want to stay home with you. Yeah, but... I know you've been saying that I don't try too hard, but I've outdone myself. Come on, babe, let's just relax. The view's nice, isn't it? Yeah, I guess, but Lookout Point's better. [meteors whooshing] [distant crashing] What was that? I don't know. I'll go check it out. No, let me call the police. No, I got this. What, no. Look, if anything, I'll bring my gun. [Camper] No, what? What the? We should go. Just a second. I want to see what caused this. No babe, really, we shouldn't be here. Look, I'm just gonna take a peak, and then we can go home, okay? Damn, check this out, what the? This is incredible. Let me see my phone. [meteorite gurgles] What the? What is it? This is incredible. What is that? [creature squeaks] [man groans] Get it off me! Oh my God, what's happening, what's happening? It said kill me! [groans] What's happening? I don't know what to do. [whimpers] Babe? [dramatic music] [woman chokes] [gunshot blasts] [thrilling music] [crow caws] Half a mile away West, 800 meters. [footsteps patter] [rifle blasts] Solid shot. Girl, it's all good. You know, you're gonna have to teach me that someday. Girl, you know, it's all about just like meditation. [laughs] Meditation? Hitting a target from at least 800 meters is more than meditation. True. It's probably that voodoo. What I do with nature is not voodoo. [phone buzzes] Hello? [helicopter propellers whipping] [Soldier] Hey, is everything okay? [siren wails] [Overhead Announcer] Dr. Davis telephone, please. Dr. Davis telephone, please. I'm Dr. Sanders. Both of his parents died immediately, okay? I'm sorry. He's in critical condition, but his younger brother's gonna be just fine. He only suffered some minor injuries. He was the lucky one. You okay? Can I see him? Yeah, but I want you to prepare yourself. I mean, he's pretty beat up. IV, oxygen, lots of bandages, you prepared for that? Okay. Right this way. [solemn music] [Overhead Announcer] Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair. Dr. Jane Hamilton, Dr. Jane Hamilton. [monitors beep] Ch... Chioma. Hey. Hi. I know you don't like surprises but, I... I couldn't resist. It... It was my idea to come see you. And my parents said they wanted to see me propose so they... So they came along. Chioma. Eze. Will you marry me? Yes, Jason, I will marry you. Well, go on, put it on then. [gentle music] The doctor says I don't have much time. But I'm happy. Aaron is safe. He has you now. My, uh... My grandparents live up north. Take Aaron to them. They'll help you take care of him. Okay. I love you. I love you too. [monitor drones] Jason? Jason? Nurse! Jason. Nurse. Nurse! Jason. Jason. Excuse me, Ma'am, if you could give me some room. - Give me some room, please. - Jason. [gentle piano music] [Chioma groans] [Chioma groans] [somber music] [tires rumble] [footsteps patter] Hey! I haven't seen you in a while. Hi. So who's the kid? My cousin. Yeah, okay. I can't wait until you have kids of your own. [keys jangle] [car beeps] It's a blessing. [gate creaks] Bye! [footsteps patter] [somber piano music] [mysterious music] [somber piano music] [mysterious music] [phone rings] [Chioma sighs] [phone rings] Hey girl, how you holding up? I'm doing okay. I'm so sorry. Jason was a great guy. Is there anything we can do? No, I'm fine. We haven't seen each other in years. I think it's about time we get together and do something. That's a great idea. I'll book plane tickets. I actually have to take Jason's brother to his grandparents, so I can't but... We'll make it a road trip then. Okay. Great, I'll get on the plane tickets. We'll see you soon, okay? [Chioma] Okay. [Dan] Lucas? Dan, it's been a while. Too long. Get over here, man. [hands slap] All right. Look at you, man, you look good. You know I try, man. You haven't changed a bit. Yeah, you know. Come on. So how are things going? Working me like a dog, man. Haven't even been back a full day. How are things with the shop? You know, same as always. But how can I help? Drug bust near the border. It involves cars. I was hoping maybe you got a spot for me to store them a couple of days or so? I think we can make it work, you know I got you. I appreciate that, man. Coffee? Always. Seen all this crazy shit going on on social media? Yeah, it's kind of hard to ignore people chopping each other's heads off. Yeah, crazy time we live in. Yup. So how's your trip back home? It's been a pain trying to bring my wife over. I hear you. I heard about your pops though. How you holding up? You know, he used to beat us every day, and every day I would wish he wouldn't come home. So he got what he deserved. And now when I look in the mirror, I make sure it's not him staring back at me. Is that why you're still single? You are not your father, Lucas. You can't let your father's sins prevent you from living your life. That's just another way of letting him win. [birds chirp] Oh, that's a scary-looking gun. Yeah, I never leave home without it. I see. Yo, I am digging this new KG cell service. It's like lightning speed compared to 5G. You should get it. Oh, no thanks. That's like cancer waiting to happen. Oh my God, Kelly. [mellow music] [tires rumble] Seeing all this violence makes me wonder about our existence. Why are we always fighting? It's human nature, Liz. Well, yeah, but you'd think we would have evolved past this by now. We just can't. Human nature is a nature of conflict. I think it takes effort to change, but things are getting better. Not in my world. People don't change. They may do something different for a period of time, but people don't change. [guests chatter] They end up doing the same thing. - Excuse me. - Oh, yes, Ma'am. - I'm ready to order. - Oh yes, I'm terribly sorry. We are shorthanded this weekend. [tense music] [tires screech] [tense music] [birds chirp] [Liz] Oh my gosh. I knew something weird was going on. Look, we popped all four of our tires. We ran over some stick or something. We only have one spare. [Liz] How are we supposed to get four new tires? Yeah, that's weird. [Kelly] Nowhere. [women chatter] [suspenseful music] When I say go, get to the back of the car. Go! [gunshots blast] [suspenseful music] [body thuds] [suspenseful music] Liz. Kell! Call 911! Liz! [whimpers] [Liz coughs] It's okay. - Okay. - Put pressure on it. - Put pressure on it! - Okay, okay. [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency? Hello? Can you hear me? My sister, she's been shot! [Liz coughs] [siren wails] [somber piano music] [door bangs] Hope you like it black. That's all we have around here. How's Aaron? The boy you've been traveling with? - Mm-hmm. - He's in good hands. You know, all of your friends keep saying that you're a hero. So I'm hoping you can help explain to me what exactly happened here. That boy has been through a lot. He lost his whole family in one day so. My condolences. Look, [clears throat] the man you shot is a key suspect in an ongoing investigation. Any information you can share would be helpful. Officer, am I being detained? I need to get him to his grandparents. [handcuffs click] As per my superiors, no, but you have to stay in town until the military police arrive. They've agreed to cooperate. But if you just help me, I'll get you on the road in no time. I promise. This is on. This is on? Yes, hello. Hello, Dr. Clark here, coming to you from the mountains out here in [laughs] God's country. And today I am testing out the new KG cell phone service. Doesn't cause cancer, they say. Better than 5G, they say. Well, today I will give you my honest opinion. As always, please like this, share this, repost this, and let's keep the truth out there. [footsteps patter] [tense music] Dr. Clark. [Dr. Clark chuckles] Well, I'd say who's asking, but I think I already know. My name's Marks. I'm with a special branch of the FBI tasked with investigating the extraterrestrial. It's our understanding you're somewhat of an expert in this field. We need your help. [suspenseful music] [footsteps patter] [gentle piano music] There you go. Yeah. I gotta stay in town until the military police show up and sort everything out. Not like we can go anywhere. Not with Liz like this. Yeah. I thought my life was heading in one direction and then... I cannot imagine what he's going through. Losing a parent isn't easy. My aunt saved us when we lost Mom. She raised us like one of her own. - She was amazing. - Yeah. I think you should do the same for Aaron. No, there is no way. I don't even know how to be a mom. And I never wanted to have kids. [Chioma sighs] That is the one thing that Jason and I could never agree on. [gentle piano music] You know, you've never met my parents. Did you ever know why? I figured you had your reasons. Did you know that I was an only child? Well, my dad was MIA and my mom, if she wasn't getting beat up by her boyfriends, was so strung out on dope that she never even noticed me. So I raised myself. I'm the product of a broken home, Kell. I have nothing to offer this kid. - I understand. - It's okay. More than, you know. And you'd be surprised what you're capable of if you just try. [gentle piano music] [crickets chirp] [tires rumble] [footsteps patter] Ah, so what's going on? I mean, unusual place for a meeting. It's not the best of accommodations. It's no World War II bunker. It's the closest location to your area, which we believe might've been ground zero for this epidemic. Epidemic? What do you mean? [footsteps patter] Where'd you find this? Not too far from here. It's my understanding you have one very similar to it, correct? [Dr. Clark] Yeah, yeah. You published a paper years ago warning people about this creature. Yeah, yeah, the world called me a nut job. I lost the respect of the science community because of it. Well, doctor, your theories have been confirmed. These creatures came down during the recent meteor shower and began inhabiting people. Per your studies, what we experienced years ago was just the first phase. We believe this time it's the real deal. Full-scale invasion. Correct. [suspenseful music] [soldier sighs] Thank you for taking care of one of our own. We're glad you guys were willing to cooperate. [dog barks] Good day, sir.

[tires rumble] Okay, so I need to make arrangements for your car to be towed back to base. - I won't be long. - Okay, thank you. [car door bangs] What you doin'? Playing a game. What's it called? Among Us. Cool. [Sergeant] All right, so we should have someone there - later today to pick it up. - Okay, thank you. No problem, thank you. - Have a good one. - Have a good one. - Okay. - Yeah. How you doin', sir? How are you? [gunshot blasts] [Chioma gasps] [suspenseful music] [glass shatters] [fist pounds] [gun rattles] [suspenseful music] It's okay, you're safe. Come on, come on. Follow me. [footsteps patter] All right, we gotta call the cops. We left our phone in the car. [Lucas] I got a cell phone. Stay right here, we'll be right back! [suspenseful music] Get down here now. We got two people down. We're at the Mountain Method. Just hang tight. [suspenseful music] Do you have a gun? - Cool. - Whoa, let's not be hasty. The police are on their way, and if anything should happen, I'll protect you. I appreciate what you did out there, but I can take care of myself. [rifle blasts] [rifle cocks] I need you to get his attention. - You want me to get shot. - Go, I'll cover you. - Your boss... - Go! [gunshots blast] [rifle blasts] [suspenseful music] Body, body. [door clatters] Hands up, hands up! To the wall! To the wall! Cuffs. Got any weapons on you? Nope. [cuffs rattle] Got any weapons on you? No, sir. The guy who did this is in there. Yeah, we'll get to the guy who did this. - You got 'em? - Yeah. Is the kid all right? Yeah. It's clear. Turn around. Start talking. Even better, I've got security footage to show you. Death follows you. I didn't ask for this. Yeah, I've been seeing some crazy stuff on social media. Social media? So we have two dead bodies. You're talking about social... [Dispatcher] All available units respond. Show officers King and Marshall responding. [Dispatcher] 257 in progress at Trail of Pines. What did you bring into my town? We have an active shooter. Don't... Just... Just don't go anywhere. Just don't move. Something's going on and I'm not gonna wait to see to find out. Can you help me with something? Depends. I need my guns and they're in my car. Yeah, I'll help you. Is that everything? - Yeah. - Where to? The hospital. [Announcer] Code Blue, Room 305. All doctors to the ER. [Nurse] Security to ER! [footsteps patter] You're still here. Yeah, it's been crazy. Who's he? Um... He helped us out of a tough spot. Hey, I'm Lucas. Kelly. What's going on out there? Some nut job shot up a bar. What? That's not the end of it. Haven't you guys been watching the news? No, why? Well. Well, let's see. The whole world has gone mad. Liz was right, something's up. People all over the world are killing each other without provocation. That's what happened to us. With over 3000 confirmed deaths, no one is sure what to make of this. Scientists believe it's some sort of virus variation. We now go live to Downtown Phoenix where our very own EMD reporter, Sylvia Smith... We've gotta get out of here. She's right. If a virus is causing people to kill, then we aren't safe here. I'm not leaving without Liz. [monitors beep] [suspenseful music] [tires rumble] [suspenseful music] - Dr. Clark, Dr. Clark! - Yeah. How are you today, sir? Good. Justin from the EMD news. - Big fan of your work. - Thank you. I've been following you since you published the paper about an alien invasion. I was hoping I could get some exclusive. Yeah. KG cell service. [tongue clicks] You're welcome. Gotta go, real press. Nice suit. Thanks. [suspenseful music] Come. Come on, come on, get out of here. Come here, clear! Get out of here, get out of here! It looks like the whole town's got mad. One thing after another, man, we can't catch a break. [gunshots pop] Here, this way. [gunshots blast] Looks like they're picking off their neighbors one by one. Best we get the drop on 'em before they notice us. Agreed. [suspenseful music] [gunshots pop] Shots, shots, shots, shots! [gunshots pop] [gunshots pop] Damn. Oh shit. Looks like they're splittin' up. Stack on me. - We got a rabbit. - I'll follow. I got him, I got him! [suspenseful music] Shit. Shit! [gunshots blast] [footsteps patter] This is Officer Marshall responding. Shots fired, we are under heavy fire. King! King, you good? [gunshots pop] [gunshots pop] [body thuds] [gunshots pop] [gunshot pops] [body thuds] [suspenseful music] [tense music] [creature squeaks] [tense music] [King] Marshall? Yeah, back here. Oh, that's gross. Where the hell did that come from? Crawled out of his mouth. I think it's dead. Hey, there's another one. Where? Hey, careful. [men shout] King, King, King! What, what is going on? King, King! I need an aid car. I need an aid car right away. King, King, stay with me, buddy. Stay with me, man. Goddamn it! Come on, King, come on. I need an aid car, I need an aid car, right away! King! King. King. Oh fuck. [dramatic music] [chokes] King. [Radio Host] It is the top of the hour here on WKGP. Here's a quick look at the news. The madness around the globe continues. And here's what a few of our listeners are experiencing locally. [Woman] My boyfriend and I were hanging out, and our roommate attacked us out of nowhere. My boyfriend's in a hospital with multiple stab wounds. [Man] Yo, my Mom just shot my Pops. I don't know what's going on, man. - Thing's are crazy out here. - Can you turn it off? I'll put some music on. [tires screech] [dramatic music] Get out of the car! [gunshots blast] Get into the bush! [gunshots blast] Go! Wait, wait, wait. Go, go, go, go, go, go! [gunshots blast] [suspenseful music] Lucas, I'm gonna go ahead and get a clear shot. - Okay, go on. - Okay. [suspenseful music] [zipper clatters] [suspenseful music] We gotta move! [Lucas groans] Come on. [suspenseful music] [gunshots blast] [sniper rifle blasts] [body thuds] [suspenseful music] [leaves crunch] [sniper rifle blasts] Keep moving. [birds chirp] - You got him? - Yup. That a girl. - I need a minute. - Come on. Put her here. Okay. I got her. Hey, are you gonna talk to Aaron? About what? About what? Chioma, he's not like you. Tell him what you would want to hear. Hey, Aaron. Let's go take a walk. Come on. Come on. [leaves crunch] [Aaron] Where are we going? I want to show you something cool. Wow. It's beautiful. Yeah. [Chioma exhales] I love nature. Have you been here before? Yeah. When I was a kid, I didn't have any friends or siblings so. I would come out here. One time, I actually fell asleep. I had a dream that nature spoke to me. That's weird. [laughs] I know. And it happened so many times that I started to realize that nature had some kind of voice. And I really think it's the one thing that connects all of us. And if you just listen. Just... [Chioma exhales] It speaks to you. [gentle piano music] [dramatic music] [Kelly] Oh my God, Liz. [fist thumps] [Kelly groans] Whoa, whoa, whoa! [gunshot blasts] - Liz! - Stay back! Stay back. You shot my friend. - Stand down. - Or what? - Stand down, Chioma! - Or what, or what? Stop! Let's cool our heads. What are you even doing here? Yeah, what are you even doing here? I'm off the grid! And my partner's dead. This is everywhere. And she's infected. - You don't know that. - Oh, I don't know that? Look, I don't know that? Come on, back up, look! Look! [Liz coughs] [Kelly whimpers] Liz, no. No. No, this is too much. [Kelly cries] [footsteps patter] Afternoon, everybody. We're here to shed some light on recent events. I am Dr. Clark, and I will get into the details. Oh, thank you, thank you. [journalists shout] While their origins remain unknown to us, we have concluded based on our findings, and in cooperation with the FBI, that these acts of aggression are carried out due to toxins injected into the brain by these creatures. These toxins affect or rather take over the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex, increasing the propensity for impulsive aggression. You know, I gotta be honest when I tell you people, I published a paper on these creatures years ago, and I said then that our first encounter with these creatures, that was a test, a feeling out, if you will. Now, what we're experiencing is the real deal. A mass genocide of the human race. [journalists shout] [birds chirp] [Kelly cries] Hey. Are you okay? Not really. [Marshall clears throat] Look, I'm sorry about your sister. I can't explain it. I've seen it. It was her or us. I've always been somebody who tries to see the bigger picture and that everything happens for a reason. But I don't know why it had to be her. Hey. Just go. [Marshall clears throat] I'm sorry. I'm just trying to wrap my head around this mess. Don't worry, man. Nobody blames you. Look, it's all over the globe. If you're watching this, my whole family was slaughtered. I barely made it out alive. This is crazy. I don't want to die. No place is safe. I really gotta get Aaron to his grandparents. No, it's best we stick together. Yeah, he's right. If we're attacked, we can defend ourselves better as a group. Sucks that we have to leave Liz behind. There's nothing we can do about it right now. We'll come back for her. Heading this way, we run into a small town so. Well, that's not good. Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose? Any alternative will cost us seven hours or runs to the freeway. There's danger on both sides. At least in town we'll have covered when night falls. It's a good point. And this town is significantly smaller than ours, so it's less trouble. I hope. All right, let's head in. [suspenseful music] [crow caws] It's too quiet. You guys, keep your guard up. [footsteps patter] [gunshot blasts] Down, down, shooter, shooter! Don't. [gunshots blast] They're bating. Any suggestions? [gunshots blast] Wait here, I'll be back. [gunshots blast] [gunshots blast] [suspenseful music] [gunshot blasts] [suspenseful music] [gunshots blast] [shells rattle] [suspenseful music] [gate creaks] [suspenseful music] [gunshots pop] [suspenseful music] [gunshots blast] [Marshall groans] [gunshots blast] [suspenseful music] [gunshots blast] What are you doing? [gunshots blast] [suspenseful music] [Chioma] It's all clear. Come on, give me a hand! Okay sweetie, rollover for me, okay? Oh. Is she gonna be okay? I don't know, let's get her up. Oh, come on, come on, okay. [Kelly groans] We gotta get her inside. We gotta get her to cover. You're gonna be fine, sweetie. Hang in there. [somber music] Keep pressure on it. Breathe regular, man. [footsteps patter] Kell, are you okay? Any chance they've got medical supplies in here? Not here, probably in town though. - I'll go take a look. - I'll come with you. - No, please. - I'll go with him. [door bangs] There's a pharmacy about a mile up the road from here. Cool. Thanks to all of your calls, we've managed to keep people informed about what's going on out there. So to show our appreciation to all of our listeners that have been supporting us over the years, keeping in mind that many of you feel unsafe out there, we want to offer you a free sanctuary here at the studio. So if you're in trouble, and you can run to us, we offer you a safe place to lay low. Now, back to the hits. [slow rap music] ♪ Got my glock around my neck ♪ ♪ Gon' let me lead fly ♪ ♪ If you see me coming with my squad you better hide ♪ [man groans] [fists pound] Sorry, this is all we could find. Find any alcohol? Place was pretty picked through, but we found a bottle. You ready? [woman groans] Now, to answer your question, initially we did believe that an infected person acted on impulse alone, but new findings show clear, thoughtful, concise action. Yeah, you know, it's like driving a car or riding a bike for the first time. You just eventually become better over time. Well, they are becoming better pilots of the human mind. [suspenseful music] May I talk to you real quick? Yeah. [door creaks] I know we've been through a lot, you know, but I need to see my grandparents. They're the only family I have left. Okay. We'll go. Kell. Hey, Kell. Kell, I'll be back, okay? I'm gonna take him to his grandparents, okay? What's going on? The kid wants to go to his grandparents. And I feel obligated to take him. All right, well, I'll go with you. I think you should stay here with Kell. I understand. [door creaks] [suspenseful music] [Martin Voiceover] Greetings, all. I bring new information. Before the arrival of our comrades, the humans possessed limited communication capabilities, but a more sophisticated way of communication called the KG was recently developed for their mobile communicators. Beware if you interact with this mobile device containing this technology. As an unintended side effect, the KG frequencies causes us to lose control of our host and effectively go into a deep sleep. [Aaron] Grandpa, we're here! [birds chirp] It's good to see you, son. It's good to see you too. [gentle piano music] [knife squelches] [Aaron groans] [knife scrapes] [suspenseful music] [body thuds] [gunshot blasts] [gunshot blasts] [Chioma groans] [gunshots blast] [Chioma groans] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stay with me. Stay with me. [creature squeaks] - Stay with me. - Get him. Get Aaron, get Aaron. [suspenseful music] [Lucas grunts] Okay, all right. Turn over. Okay, come on, come on. Can you still remember me? Come on. [Lucas grunts] [Chioma groans] [Dr. Clark sighs] Thank you all for being patient. I know it's not easy being cooped up in here all day. But it is crucial that we keep the public up to date on findings as they become available to us. So with that, we'll get into it. It's clear to us now that these creatures are evolving at a rapid rate. Based on those calculations, we predict the death toll could rise into the hundreds of millions. Hey, Dr. Clark. - Sorry, awkward place. - Yeah. - Quick question. - Yeah. What you spoke about during the press conference, would you like to elaborate? I can't get into specifics. You know that I could just tell you this. We are working on a solution. It involves KG technology, that's all I can say, okay? [Reporter] Okay. Thank you. [rain pours] [door creaks] [thunder rumbles] [suspenseful music] Ooh. Easy, easy, easy. You should stay down. Where is everyone? Chioma and Aaron left. Lucas followed pretty close after. They're probably at their destination by now. - I should call them. - No, stop moving. You're gonna reopen the wound. Look. Hey, okay, lay down, lay down. Shh. Hey, there's no service anyway, okay? They'll call in the morning after the rain breaks. [Kelly breathing deeply] Kelly. No, no, Kelly. [somber piano music] [Marshall cries] Come on! [somber piano music] [Marshall cries] [thunder cracks] [Chioma gasps] Whoa. Easy, easy. I know I told you this before, but I'm amazed by your strength. Even in pain and going in and out of consciousness, you still managed to talk me through cauterizing your wound. Did you? I had to, but I put your clothes back on. Where's Aaron? Over there. Please don't. Stay and eat. Help me up. [Chioma groans] [solemn piano music] [Chioma cries softly] [birds chirp] Thank you. [groans] Thank you. I feel like I've lost so much. I can't even pretend to know what you're going through. But just know I'm here with you. I didn't have the best relationship with my parents growing up. So I never wanted to have kids. [sighs] Then I met Aaron and, I don't know, something changed. But it's like all that was for nothing because clearly I failed him. [suspenseful music] [Aaron gasps] [suspenseful music] [fist smashes] [bodies thud] Aaron, stop! Stop, stop! [Chioma groans] [tense music] You sure about this? People might not understand. Yeah. I'm not letting him out of my sight. We'll figure it out. [Lucas] All right. Scattered across the globe are meteors from which these creatures came. Upon further examination, we discovered that these meteors act as information hubs. So disruption to their communication should cripple their efforts. Now, these... These creatures were captured near a crashed meteor. And as you know how aggressive these creatures can be, but once the meteor was destroyed, they became inactive. But each meteor is guarded by infected humans. So our countermeasure is going to require [sighs] global cooperation. Now we've developed a jamming signal based on KG technology, which should render the creatures inactive long enough to destroy the meteors. [birds chirp] What happened to you guys? Long story. We'll be fine though. How's Kell? Uh. I'm sorry. [solemn music] [birds chirp] So what happened out there? You and Aaron? Well, I got shot. And he got infected. But I've been giving him these shots every four hours to keep him asleep. I'm gonna save him. You might just be in luck. They think they've come up with a way to do just that. Mobilizing people all around the world, as many as possible, trying to execute some plan. Okay. We've devised a way to jam the effects of the KG. If you happen to fall under its effects, here's what you must do. At this point, we must assume the creatures are aware of our plans, but this is our best shot, and we must take it. At 1200 hours, we begin broadcasting the jamming signal. All cell phones across the globe will receive this signal. Instructions on how to create timed explosives with common items have also been distributed. Good luck to us all. [Lucas] It's locked. Come. Cover up. Fire in the hole. [gunshot blasts] [suspenseful music] Hey, you think there's anything that we can use in here? I don't know, man. All of this stuff's pretty old. Doubtful we'll find what we need here. I think I have some grenades in my car. Yeah, and I can rig them to a can of gasoline. Okay, and if you can light it up, I can shoot it. All right. - I'll provide backup. - Okay. I have three shots left, so let's make 'em count. - Sounds good. - Copy that. [gentle piano music] I know these last few days have been a little rough, but I promise you I'm gonna do what I can to get things back to normal, okay? [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [grass crunches] According to the satellite map they gave us, this is the closest crash site to where Aaron was infected. Okay, so everyone knows the plan? All right, be careful. [suspenseful music] Well, assuming they don't know what's coming, I've planned a second wave of attack. One that is ethically questionable, but if successful, we win. And it's, this stays between you and I if it's to work, okay? Okay. Okay. You ever hear of the fourth phase of water? No. It's a phase of water in which water is both a liquid and a solid. It's a very reactive stage, reactive to frequencies, vibrations, things like that. Within the human cell, you'll find this fourth phase. So the first blast is a decoy. Whereas the second silent blast is aimed at the cells. The theory being the cells will magnify the blast millions of times over, making it stronger than the first blast. And because it's silent, the enemy won't hear it coming. Right. There is one possible side effect. And? Targeting cells could prove to be fatal. I see.

[gun rattles] There you go. Now, come here. That's it, come here. It's nice to finally meet you. You know, your skills, they're gonna be extremely valuable to us, but if you resist, you die.

[Marshall] Does that mean it worked? I think so. What do you wanna do with him? Arrest him? How you holding up? I've been better. I'm just glad it's over. Okay, big boy. Hey, we're gonna get your home, I see you. We're gonna get you help. Nice shot. You're welcome. Gonna put these on you, okay? We're gonna get you help. We're gonna get you help.

All right, all right, come on. Don't look away, look this way. Come on. [solemn music] Thanks to the combined efforts of people across the globe, we have taken our home back from these invaders. Hopefully, we've grown a great deal in the process. We're better equipped to face any extraterrestrial threat we may face in the future. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. [solemn music] So are you sure I can't convince you to stay just a little bit longer? I have to go back to base. Well, I guess this is it then. You can always come visit. You can count on it. Cool. You ready? Yeah. Put on your seatbelt.
