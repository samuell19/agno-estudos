Mao Sheng! Mao Sheng! Mao Sheng! (creature roaring) (ominous music) (roar echoing) (suspenseful music) Zhi Yu... Zhi Yu... Zhi Yu, there is a lady who will come to see you. You better go get ready for yourself. I've told you that I don't want English tutor. If looking for me, tell her that you can't find me. [Father] Hi. Hi. Sorry, it's okay. It's okay. Oops. Uh. Sorry. (speaking foreign language) My name is... Oh, it's okay. I speak English. (sighing) (laughing) - Hi. - [Man] It's nice to meet you. Hi, nice to meet you. Come this way, please. Wow, you must be loaded. Excuse me? You have a lovely home. [Father] Well, I work very hard to make sure my son has the best. [Denise] Can I ask you a question? [Father] Of course. Why is this job a full-time live-in position? That's a lot of English studies. Thank you. Things have been difficult since my wife passed away last year. My son has also struggled. So in addition to tutoring I could use a little help at home. I understand. My condolences. Zhi Yu. Please come out and meet your new tutor. Hi, Zhi Yu. It's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, it's to me, pleasure for you meet. (chuckling) Zhi Yu, show some respect! It's okay. Just give him some time. My apologies. No need to apologize. (door slamming) So, what's the plan? I have a new job in Wanzhou and I need you to fly there with Zhi Yu, set up the house and get him into his new school. As soon as I wrap up business here I will join you a few weeks later. When do you want me to start? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Mhmm. Uh. Okay. Okay. Okay! Thank you. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (metal scraping) Duke. (laughing) Hey, Mr. Chey. - How are you? How are you? - Thank you. (laughing) (speaking foreign language) Good... good... (ominous music) Okay! (speaking foreign language) Mr. Chey? (chuckling) One more thing. How much? (speaking foreign language) A fairytale. (laughing) There's been evidence, huh? In the caves right here in this region. Not just by your farmers, but by scientists. (speaking foreign language) And we just found this. Huh? [Duke] In a bear trap. (ominous music) No bear. No, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. He wants... He wants one alive. Two million. Two million U.S., U-S dollars! Yeah? (laughing) (ominous music) Zhi Yu, some help? (plane engine humming) You ever been on a plane before? I fly one on FS ten. On what? Flight simulator. It's a computer game. Same thing. Not exactly. (laughing) It must be destiny. Yeah. Joshua Ridley, energy consultant. I'm his business partner, Piao Zhimin. It's nice to meet you. I'm Denise Nichols and this is Zhi Yu. So what hotel are you guys staying at? Zhi Yu, get out your English grammar book. [Zhi Yu] No. Please get it out, chapter six. Thank you. Where? Chapter six, here. (speaking foreign language) That's an interesting necklace. Where'd you get it? None of your business. It was my mother's. My friends tease me and say that is a girl's necklace. They don't know anything. And I think it's very cool. Want to read the newspaper? Okay. Thank you. Hey, did you know that we're flying over one of the most mysterious places in all of China? Mhmm. Where you see mystery, I see opportunity. Hey, the Yeren lives in Shennongjia, under our plane. Wow. What kind of energy business are you in? Anything that burns, baby. Responsibly, of course. Those green mountains are home to some of the rarest animals on Earth. You know, golden monkeys, giant salamanders. How many jobs has a salamander created? (ominous music) (speaking foreign language) (ominous music) (growling) (rumbling) Are you okay? Maybe. Put on your seat belt. (whooshing) (thundering) Honey, I fly over 250,000 miles a year. Nothing to worry about. (thunder cracking) Is this something to worry about? What's wrong? (ominous music) (gasping) (rumbling) (suspenseful music) (yelling) Stop screaming, you're scaring him! Help! Help! (whooshing) (booming) (birds chirping) (ominous music) (yelling) Help! Help! We're gonna crash! (yelling) We're gonna crash! (yelling) (coughing) Help, we're gonna crash! We're gonna crash! Help! Help! Help! We already crashed, you idiot! Zhi Yu! Zhi Yu's under this. He's under the seat. Let's get him up. Piao Zhimin, help! Piao Zhimin, help us! Zhi Yu? Zhi Yu? (steam hissing) (ominous music) Zhi Yu? Zhi Yu, talk to me. Can you hear me? Help! Help! You got him? Yeah, I got him. You take care of the old man. Mister Feng, can I see? (somber music) All right, listen. You're gonna be fine. Okay? Just sit tight. You're totally safe now. (whooshing) Does anything else hurt? On your body? Does anything hurt? (speaking foreign language) I think you're gonna be okay, okay? Let's get out of the plane. Hua, is flower. Fire?! Fire! Fire! Fire! (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (growling) (coughing) We gotta get out of here! (coughing) (gasping) Where's Zhi Yu? He's fine. He's over by the... By the tree. What? Zhi Yu? Piao, where is he? Who? The kid! The kid! The kid, like that tall! Girlie necklace! Where is he? Maybe he's in shock and wandered off. Don't go anywhere, I'll take care of it! He's my responsibility. I need to go and find him! No, you don't. You need to stay here and wait for the... (yelling) It's gonna be fine. I'm gonna call the rescue copter. I have my phone. It's fine. And it has no signal. Great. (thudding) (ominous music) Zhi Yu? Zhi Yu, if you can hear me, make a noise! Mr. Feng? You're a little bit cut up, but nothing that looks really serious. You're probably gonna need some stitches, but we can't do that here. So we're going to bandage you up first, okay? Thank you. Piao, go get a first aid kit. Sit tight, I gotta see if I can find the pilots. Okay? (ominous music) (water rushing) Zhi Yu?! Zhi Yu?! (suspenseful music) (water rushing) (speaking foreign language) (ominous music) (speaking foreign language) Is anybody there? Hello? (steam hissing) Pilots? We have ELT. We'll be okay. You mean the emergency beacon, right? Yes. Zhi Yu! Zhi Yu! Zhi Yu! (Zhi Yu yelling) Zhi Yu! (ominous music) Zhi Yu! Denise! (creature grunting) (growling) (foreboding music) (snarling) (eerie music) (creature growling) (creature grunting) (screaming) (sighing) Oh, Zhi Yu! You're okay! Oh, God! You're okay, you're okay! What happened? How did you get here? - I was in the plane. - [Denise] Yeah. And then I woke up in this cave. (creature growling) Okay, we need to go. (ominous music) (creature roaring) No, stay there. (water dripping) Damn it. Okay, we need to go this way. (creature growling) Okay. (echoing roar) Okay, go. Okay, go. Go, go! Go, go! (suspenseful music) Good. (growling) (creature grunting) Go! Go! Go! Go! (ominous music) (screaming) (growling) (suspenseful music) (cracking) (snarling) (growling) (grunting) (growling) Don't look at him. Keep your eyes on the floor, okay? You understand me? Keep your eyes on the floor. (creature grunting) (suspenseful music) (growling) (roaring) (grunting) Joshua. Joshua, wake up. (roaring) (dramatic music) (grunting) (growling) (groaning) (roaring) (somber music) [Josh] Zhi Yu! Where are you? [Denise] Zhi Yu! [Josh] Zhi Yu! (ominous music) Good day! Good day? (speaking foreign language) Are you Mao Sheng? The Yeren hunter, eh? (speaking foreign language) Yes. He thinks we're reporter. No, no, no, no. We're scientists. And we think you've made a remarkable discovery. (speaking foreign language) Yes! Yes! Yes! Please, sit down. Sit. Why are you doing here? We would like to hear about your encounter with the Yeren. (Yong Sai speaking foreign language) He says they only saw a bear with toothache. No, no, no. My father... (speaking foreign language) It was the Yeren. Taller than Yao Ming. Lots of teeth. You, um... Did you? Do you think you would be able to show us where you last saw the Yeren? He wants us to leave. We will pay you, yeah? For your trouble. He doesn't want our money. Sorry to disturb you then. That's it? You're giving up so easily? On the count of three. One, two... Hi! Three. Be at the river behind our house in the morning and I take you to find the Yeren. (suspenseful music) Let's make the fire really big because I want the rescue helicopters to be able to see us. That's weird. These are known medicinals. And so we're assuming that the animal did this? He is not an animal. Okay, what is he? A human? Who can, like, come out of the forest and help us? He is not a man. (speaking foreign language) He says, some people believe the Yeren is stupid, half-way between man and ape. Other people think they are very smart, the protector of the forest. I think he's very intelligent. I don't care if he's a Yeti, a Sasqautch or like a mutant hillbilly, we are the most intelligent monkeys on the planet. That's what allowed us to conquer it. That's what allowed us to invent modern twenty-first century medicine. So lets take the twigs and the dirt and the mud off the kid's leg and give him some real medicine, okay? You're mean. Yes, I am mean! Stop. We're in a forest with a creature after a plane crash, so I apologize if I hurt your feelings. But let's put some antibiotics on your leg so that it can get better, okay? Joshua? Calm down. Piao, get the first aid kit. Piao! (ominous music) Piao took the emergency kit. He took everything. The food, the supplies. Everything is gone. (foreboding music) That's ridiculous. Why would he do that? I guess he saw an opportunity. (growling) (yelling) (booming) (creature roaring) (screaming) (creature howling) (ominous music) (fire crackling) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (sobbing) (dramatic music) (creature howling) (gasping) (creature growling) (ominous music) (forest commotion) (creature huffing) (growling) (grunting) (coughing) (ominous music) Zhi Yu. (gasping) (grunting) You seriously don't remember what happened last time you left the plane? You're memory is like that... (growling) (growling) (Joshua stammering) Shoo! What are you doing? (growling) What? What are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? He's not hurting us. He's right. He wasn't hurting us. Oh well, well, I apologize then, for misunderstanding what the nice monster wanted. Yes, no that's okay, don't thank me for saving your life twice. Yep, bad Joshua always coming in, saving the day... (creature roaring) (ominous music) (birds chirping) (floor creaking) (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (birds chirping) Hello. My friend. You are late. With the high altitude, it was a little bit of a challenge, mate. (speaking foreign language) Not for me. I'm okay. I am strong. I prove Yeren really exists. Oh, good. Well you can lead the expedition then, yeah? You are in charge. Come on. (ominous music) (birds chirping) There's a plane, there's a plane. Help! It's a plane! Hello! Hey, we're over here! Help! Help! Help! Help! [Denise] We're down here! We're down here! Help! Help! [Both] Help! Help! [Joshua] I'm gonna go put more wood on the fire. Stop! The fire is not gonna work. Feng is in bad shape. We need to get him to a doctor right away. Exactly, he's in bad shape. He's in no shape to make a big mountain hike. Then we will carry him. We will follow the stream until... Oh, that's a great idea! With a big monster waiting out there to eat us. That's a chance we'll have to take. It says in every survival manual, "stay by the plane, stay by the plane, "stay by the plane!" It's like survival 101. Yet, you want to go wander off into the wilderness. That's the plan? To risk everybody's life? That's exactly what we're going to do. (water rushing) (ominous music) Ah, crikey! (ominous music) (creature squealing) (screaming) (yelling) (whimpering) Wow. You finally found your albino salamander, huh? (laughing) (adventurous music) Oh. Come on, Mister Feng. Sit down, sit down. (groaning) I think we should stop and rest. I'm tired too. Okay. Okay. We should build a shelter. It's definitely going to get cold tonight. I'll go get some branches. (ominous music) Denise? [Denise] What? That thing. I saw it. It's tracking us. It's protecting us. (suspenseful music) Look. (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) (yelling in foreign language) (somber music) (speaking foreign language) (creature growling) (coughing) (creature grunting) Hello? (pig squealing) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (growling) (gunshot booming) (speaking foreign language) We don't need witnesses. Don't worry, I'll handle this. (Denise huffing) Zhi Yu! (gasping) Zhi Yu, are you okay? The boar was chasing me, but he shot it. What? Oh my God, are we happy to see you guys. You survived the plane crash, did you? Yes, we did. Is that alive? [Duke] No, dead as a doorknob, mate. We have an elderly man with us who may have a punctured lung. Which one of you is the medic? Yeah, we've got a first aid kit. Chow? (Yong Sai speaking foreign language) First aid kit? So, you guys aren't like the main rescue team then? Ah. Yeah, no. No, no, no, we're just researching rare animals up here in Shennongjia. Duke Darwin, mate. And this is my friend, Doctor Yong Sai. Joshua Ridley, energy consultant, nice to meet you. This here is Denise, and this is Zhi Yu. We don't care where you guys are from, what you do, we just want to get the hell off this mountain. Anybody hungry? (fire crackling) So how'd you survive the plane crash? We were over a meadow and the pilots tried to land there, but they didn't make it. And we got lucky. Then we were attacked by a bear. But he was no match for the Yer... The yelling. We screamed and it scared the bear away. So what university did you say you guys are with? Privately funded, love. Corporate gravy train. It's where the money is. (Feng coughing) I will take him some water. Okay. Cigar? Thanks, Duke. Cigar? I'd love one. I'm a bit of a connoisseur, actually. Only the best, mate. I'm gonna go calibrate some, uh... Equipment. (coughing) (foreboding music) How's the old man doing? He has a fever. He's a tough old coot. He'll be all right. Hey, it's Zhi Yu, isn't it? I want to talk to you about something. Come on, son. He'll be okay. (ominous music) (speaking foreign language) Oh, thank you so much. Oh, I'm good. Thank you very much. (ominous music) Excuse me. I'm going to make sure the equipment is calibrated. Okay. See you soon. See you. Okay. I'm going to tell you something, laugh after I tell you. Okay. They're planning on killing us. Laugh. (giggling) (laughing) How do you know that? Because I speak Chinese. You what? Yeah, it's really useful in business to not let on, and like, when people are going to kill you secretly. Laugh again. (laughing) You know how we're here to study and protect endangered species? You know, like that bear you saw, right? I guess so. I'm just wondering whether you've seen any other unusual creatures around here. Unusual? Yeah, like I'm thinking extremely rare, matey. Like uh... Maybe uh... Two and half meters tall, (grunting) long red hair. Like a big ape on steroids. I'd remember. Level with me kid. You've seen the Yeren, haven't you? No. Only newspaper. You want that old man to get medical attention or not? (sighing) Okay. We saw one. He says he's the guardian of the forest. And is he close by? No. If you're lying to me kid! (growling) Tiger? He's been here all along, hasn't he? He's been following us. Following or chasing? Yeren is my friend. He's your friend, is he? No! (growling) Not exactly. (grunting) (ominous music) Come on! (speaking foreign language) Easy, old man. You're in bad shape. Take your hand off the boy. I'm afraid I can't do that. Because if this creature is the last Yeren on Earth, I'm gonna be the one to catch him. (ominous music) No! Come on! I've got other plans for you! Let go of me! Hey! You want the old man to live or die? Because as soon we get your Yeren, the sooner Feng gets medical help. You got it? Because he is the fish, yeah? And you, my friend, are the bait! (suspenseful music) Hold this for a sec. Okay. (thudding) (exciting music) Hey! Not so fast. (dramatic music) You have no idea what you're dealing with. Yeah? All I know is, we've got weapons and he doesn't. (speaking foreign language) Come on! Move it, little man! (yelling in foreign language) (growling) (snickering) You know, that's very touching. Come out, you bloody big baboon! You saved him once, didn't you? So why don't you give it a second go?! Huh?! (growling) Come out, you bloody big gorilla! (growling) Yong Sai, I need backup! I'll be right back. I've got it. Got it at twelve o'clock. Chow! Flank left. Li Wei. (ominous music) (yelling foreign language) (Yeren roaring) (suspenseful music) Yeren? Yeren? (growling) Don't move! You're in danger. (growling) (Duke yelling) (suspenseful music) (roaring) (man yelling) (growling) (man screaming) (ominous music) (Yeren grunting) (growling) (booming) (grunting) (snarling) No! I'm gonna take him alive! (suspenseful music) Feng! Over here. (Yeren growling) (huffing) Yeren. (groaning) (dramatic music) No! (growling) (Yeren groaning) Yeren! No! Yeren! Yeren! (crying) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (somber music) You've said your last good-byes. You're wasting time! (dramatic music) We're gonna make history, Doctor Sai. More importantly, we're going to be very rich! (groaning) Let the Yeren go! He never hurted you! Technically he did, kid. He gave my men a beating. Look, if you take him out of his natural habitat, he could die. His immune system could be compromised. That's enough out of you. You know, I think that we might have had a little bit of a misunderstanding. As you know, I'm a businessman. I have a win-win proposition for you. Right-o. Okay. (groaning) Professional opinion, but I think you guys are gonna have a little bit of trouble selling this monster. Got it sorted, mate. Okay, what're you getting? Two million. Two million? Really? That's all. Smart ass. Well, listen. Actually. Wait! Let the man speak. I think I can get you in the neighborhood of twenty million dollars. Well, how are going to do that, mate? I do land lease deals with this casino owner in Macao. You know, his new casino is going to have a zoo. Like an endangered species zoo. You're joking, right? You may be willing to risk your life for this oversized orangutan, I am not. He'll be in a zoo, he'll be well taken care of. Joshua! You're pigs. All of you. I get ten percent. You get five. Seven and a half. Deal. (suspenseful music) Hold on! Hold it, just hold it a minute. Put it down. Mao Sheng! Mao Sheng! (groaning) Are you okay? He wanted me to protect the Yeren, I failed him. Oh, sweetie. Look, you cannot give up, okay? Mao Sheng, why don't we go that way instead? (speaking foreign language) Mate, you're analog. I'm a digital man. Here, watch me. (ominous music) We are going that way! That way is dangerous. We could get lost. Whatever! Let's go! Come on! (suspenseful music) (somber music) (speaking foreign language) Hurry up! (Denise whimpering) (moaning) (groaning) I hurt my feet. (groaning) (yelling) The kid's got ten seconds to decide his own fate! Duke, calm down. Let's all calm down. (suspenseful music) We're at the peak. The SAT phone might work. I'll make the call, we do the deal. All righty, then. Okay. Okay. Li Wei, prepare the shot tranquilizer! (groaning) Are you okay? Give it try. (speaking foreign language) (moaning) Josh! Josh. Just one little problem. Yong Sai disabled the phone. (ominous music) (gun clicking) (gunshot booming) Drop your weapons! (suspenseful music) (growling) (groaning) (gunshots booming) (growling) (booming) (speaking foreign language) (groaning) Wait here. Police. Okay. How bad is it? It's okay. (speaking foreign language) Zhi Yu! Zhi Yu! Father! We're here! Zhi Yu, no! No! No! Go! Go! Father! (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (yelling) (thudding) (groaning) (crying) I've got use for you now, kid. Eh? (laughing) Help me! Father, help me! Father, help me! You play it safe old man and put you little stick down. You want a hostage? Take me instead! (laughing) I got your boy. You do as I say! Forget the boy. We can handle it, man to man! (suspenseful music) Nah. We do it my way. Tell the cops to back off! Nobody leaves the forest until daybreak, you got that? Yeah. Just don't hurt boy. (intense music) (groaning) (gagging) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (booming) (groaning) Are you okay? Yeah, I'm a tough guy. (ominous music) (growling) (booming) (gun clicking) (growling) (roaring) Yeren! Zhi Yu! Not again! [Father] Zhi Yu! (suspenseful music) Yeren! (whimpering) (growling) (foreboding music) No! Yeren! No! (suspenseful music) (growling) Show a little bit of human kindness. (menacing music) (snarling) You will never be one of us. You're an animal. You'll never understand the difference between revenge and justice. You beast! (growling) (screaming) (somber music) Yeren! Yeren! (grunting) (growling) (dramatic music) (moaning) [Father] Zhi Yu! (growling) Yeren? (moaning) (dramatic music) (Yeren howling) (dramatic music)
