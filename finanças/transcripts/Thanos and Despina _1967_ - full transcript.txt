Thanos and Despina What's the matter? It's not noon yet. I want you to get married, son. I'm going to get you a wife. Where? She'll have a fat dowry. I'll show them this. Wait here! I'm going to Vlahopoulos. He's got to give us his daughter. Don't go! Vlahopoulos is rich. He was our boss. You're not going to leave for Australia. Australia... I've come to make a proposal. What did you say? I didn't understand. I've found a husband for your daughter, Vlahopoulos. Leave us alone. Who are you? Come closer! Hello, Katina! What's your name? Don't you remember me? My husband used to work for you. He died here, under your roof. I'm Katina Zekos... Thanos' mother. My husband was related to you. A very distant relation. Yes, very distant. Come closer! Tell me... Who sent you? Someone who wants to know how much the dowry? Oh, he wants to know! Should the amount be the one he heard about... you can keep her. You won't get much of a son-in-law for that price. I nearly forgot. He knows your daughter very well. Tell me! Who is it? Marry her off quickly. You never know... Be quiet! His name! Don't shout. How much? His name first! I'll make you a nice gift. Really? I swear it. On my daughter's honor. 25 drachmas. - How much? - 35! You'll buy your son some socks. Tomorrow's Easter. It's Thanos. Which Thanos? Thanos Zekos! My son! Get the hell out of here! - Why? - Get out! Isn't my son good enough for you? Look! He brought this back from Germany! He stole it! That's a lie! He worked in a factory. He didn't want me to come. Look at her! She's old, ugly and not too pure. I'm rich! I have fields of tobacco. I have 20 men who get a hundred times more than your crummy son. I know how generous you are. My husband was buried naked. I'm going to squash you... all of you. Go on... If you dare. It won't work. Get her! Throw her out. Your son's a thief. He shamed us all. He dishonored our country. He's a son of a bitch. You heard him? He called me a bitch. Me! The daughter of Pope Michael on Easter Saturday! Curse you, Vlahopoulos! Despina! Take this, Vlahopoulos! It's all I've got left. - Where were you? - Here, father. - Where? - Right here. What's going on? I'm talking to your daughter. Leave us alone. - Have you seen him? - Who? That jerk, thief. That old hog's son. I haven't. You're lying! Answer me! When did you seen him last? A year ago... When he came back from Germany. - And since then? - No! Murderer! Thrown out of everywhere. He has the nerve to send his mother to me! What are we coming to? My daughter! Are you sure you didn't see him? He didn't come near you? Didn't touch you? Come! Come closer! That old witch! Come here. What's the matter? The bastards! They want to destroy me... to get me. Who? You know him? - Whom? - That illiterate half-wit... We grew up together. His father worked here. That means nothing. You must respect rank and honor. Your brother's going to be a scientist. And I'll find you a good husband. Government servant, maybe? On your wedding day... I want people to say: "What a wonderful husband... "Vlahopoulos found for his daughter. "And what a dowry!" Do you understand? Your brother's bringing a friend. Will you be glad to see Pericles? You won't be called Vlahopoulos much longer. Sit down, Papadimas. My son Yankos found you at last. Have a cigarette? Thank you, Karavidas. He's a nice boy. Are you still a go-between? I sometimes arrange marriages. What percentage do you get? It depends. I want my son to get married. Fine! To whom? I don't know yet. I see! I have more cattle than my neighbor. I employ five shepherds. Since my son was drafted... I've hired another. A good-for-nothing. He guards my goats. If I'm not mistaken... you've Vlahopoulos' daughter in mind. I have my son's future in mind. Very, very difficult. I also have your share in mind. I'm not ungrateful. I'll try. Don't waste time. I want a wife for him... before he's demobilized. He'll be with you in a minute. Take him home. We'll go to church tonight. The Vlahopoulos will be there. You're covered in dust. I'll go and change. No! Keep your uniform. Get it pressed. Do you know what your protégé did? He sent his mother to ask for Despina's hand. What a rival! His mother's idea. She wants to keep him here. - How do you know? - She told me so. It's about time you came back. I don't want him here. - What's he done? - Nothing yet. I'm watching him. You like him. That's why I hired him when he was thrown out of Germany. He was starving. You've got to help the poor folks. T.ZEKOS My son's not good enough for you? But we need the dowry... more than anyone else. My father was a well-known pope. If only he'd known how to read, he'd have been patriarch. My husband was worthless. Do you hear me? A misfit! And you're just like him. I've been insulted, thrown out. Me! Katina Zekos! "Your son is a thief, Katina! "No one wants him." No one wants you. You'll starve to death. Like your father! Let me go away. I don't want to die of hunger. I don't want to be castrated. Let me go to Australia. No! Europe! Europe, your automobiles! Look at this poverty! Shut up. You bother me. So do you... with your moaning. Did you hear... my sheep... exploding like shells? They stole my goats, killed my dog. They'll put me in jail. Germany! Shut up! In Germany, you were nothing. Ignorant there, ignorant here. You're illiterate, untrained! You're moaning... If you weren't so stupid, your sheep would still be alive. You killed them. Look at my sheep! Hear the sound of their agony? They're flying from Europe to Australia. I'm going to bury my dog. Then, I'll round up my goats. I'll help you. For heavenly music. For earthly music. For when the mountains quake. Your boss's son. Your boss too. Be careful! He's my friend. The rich distrust poor friends. And they're right. The poor don't mistrust their wealthy friends. And they may be wrong. - You returned! - Last night. Your uniform? It's being pressed for tonight's mass. Good to see you. How do you like the Army? Fine! I'm learning lots of things. - Have you used a chute yet? - No! I saw your mother this morning. Where're you going? The goats got away. Your father'll kill me. Come on! I'm coming. Thanos, your cloak... What did you say? Where are they? - Has Vlahopoulos been here? - Not yet. Want to see him? Yes, about business. These papers print anything. Sometimes even news. Apart from what they hide. A country without papers is unthinkable. A civilized country. It's quite possible... I'm telling you... What's going on? Nothing! Coffee for Mr. Vlahopoulos! Your daughter, Despina, will soon... She's young. There's no hurry. The old woman did this! I was just telling Karavidas. Manolis pretends that a civilized country doesn't need papers. Isn't Greece a civilized country? Ancient Greece didn't have papers. Manolis is right. A modern country needs the press. But not a rotten press. Where'd we get news from? During the war? During the revolution? Civil war, not revolution! Foreign countries encouraged us to fight each other. It didn't need much encouragement. Damn war! I lost two brothers. Curse it! It costs me three sons. Someone here is on the side of my father's killers. He was a traitor. And how many did you denounce? Me? A traitor? Yes, you informer. Wait for me here, you bastard. I'll be right back. I'll go with you. - They're going to get their guns. - Let's go! I'll think it over, Papadimas. I didn't know he had so many herds. Yankos is a good boy. I'll think it over. Your father! Can't you see him? He'll be your father too. Father-in-law. Your father has agreed. It'll make him very happy. Are you glad to be my brother-in-law? Of course! Didn't I tell you, Karavidas? "Katina's son is thief. "A scoundrel! "He stole the goats and is going to sell them. "Katina, your son will finish at the end of a rope. "What are you going to eat "now that he's in jail?" "Thanos, my son! "Cursed be the day my womb ejected you." "Katina, open your womb! "Your son wants to return!" You're right. Father doesn't like you. He'll have you arrested. I could run away. I'll try to soothe him. I'll talk to him, I'll implore him. Take me with you. Where can we go? He'll kill me for what you've done. He's so severe. I've got to find them again, all of them. Schweine... Reine... Raus... Mein Gott... You speak German well! Ja, ja. Gut, gut. With Despina's dowry, I'd have bought tobacco plantations. Tobacco, that pays. What about Despina? Don't you regret her? After all the German girls you've had! You must have dazzled the Germans! Vlahopoulos said no? Even if he'd accepted after this... I heard about what your mother did. Look! - Tell me! - He's going to catch it! Vlahopoulos threw her out. She lifted her skirt and showed her... Leave it alone! Get out of my field! I didn't want them to see me. Father mustn't know I was with you. Let's run away, you and me. To Australia! I want to leave as soon as I'm demobilized. My father wants me to marry. Guess who? Despina! He sent them a go-between. He wants to buy me a grocery store with the dowry. Go ahead! Marry! I don't want to. I want to go abroad with you. Try my luck. Make a lot of money. I don't want to be a grocer. Aren't you hard to please! On your return from Germany, you promised we'd leave together. Shut up! There they are! Let's go away. Leave this country! Leave our parents! Get away from this poverty! Together, we'll show them. Come on! Let's run away! We can't! I'm going to jail and you're going to your barracks. That's it! We'll come out at the same time. But where are those goats? Where the hell did they go? Okay. I'll take you to Australia. You've learned lots of useful things. Like killing my dog. And the goats? They're yours, of course. We'll settle that in Australia. Nothing difficult about that. Pull, both of you! I'll leave you. I'll need you later. Here's the letter you brought me. Your father says that he agrees. You can marry my daughter Despina. He gives you his blessing and so do I. Your parents are respectable people. They brought you up and made you what you are. From the bottom of my heart, I hope you'll follow their example. I too gave everything up for the future of my children, my daughter and her husband. I'll buy you an apartment in Salonica with the dowry. It's all arranged. There, you see? Near the big rock. She did it there? In front... of everybody. I've deposited in the bank you know how much... You can use it whenever you like in case of birth or sickness. But I'm sure your father explained all this to you. Is everything settled? Yes, father! That's fine! Come! Your future son-in-law! I want to speak to you. Today's the day when I'm rewarded for my long-lasting efforts. But my sacrifices will only end the day you marry a girl with a handsome dowry. You'll be able to set up as a dentist with my help, of course, and God's too! Go now! Tell your sister the good news. The betrothal ceremony... will take place tomorrow. Good gracious! An old woman naked in the streets in broad daylight! And on the same day... her son slaughters his goats! Something evil's going to happen. What did Thanos do? When he was told he couldn't marry you, he started to kill his goats. Then he killed his dog and ran away. The police are after him. He swore they wouldn't get him alive. What is it, Pericles? Can you leave us alone for a moment? Take your time. See you later! Father entrusted me with a mission. He asked me to tell you something important... concerning your future. I hope you'll be pleased. - What news? - No. I don't mean "pleased". I wish that... No... I mean... I hope that this news satisfies you. Or rather that you'll be happy. As if they'd allowed you to choose. What are you talking about? Making fun of me? The young man... who came with me will be... - Yes? - Your husband. He was bought with gold coins. It's called a dowry! Rejoice! A beautiful one! But you spat it out. My beautiful wedding. You seem to think it's a disaster. What's bothering you? Don't cry over my tears. Are you a vegetable or a living being? You've seen this man but once. You don't even know him. He may be crippled or be afflicted with body odor. How do you like him? I find him handsome. Father chose him, didn't he? But it's your life! Haven't you ever wanted to know other men? To talk to them, to make their acquaintance, to know who they are, to search in a crowd for a soothing hand upon your breast? That's enough! Shut up! You're not alive. Go out into the street! Learn to breathe! And choose! In the street? In the open? To pick up men? Get acquainted? Find lovers? I should choose handsome or ugly? Shepherds or wealthy citizens? To make a wise choice, I must try them out. Should I spend my life going from bed to bed seeking that elusive hand? What if I get to like this endless search? What choice? Where is it? If you're everybody's mistress! Be quiet! You poor thing! That's no way to argue. You talk like a female. I was talking about women's rights. I didn't mean love. I love my husband-to-be as I've always loved you... as I love my father. I didn't choose you. What rights are you talking about? The right to make a whore out of me? The worst kind. A benevolent whore! Grant me the choice unconditionally. My husband, yes... But I want the right to choose my father and my brother... and my mother's womb first. I'm so grateful, father! You're so generous! You're God! Give your mother a kiss! Don't cry, mother! We'll often come to see you. Stop it! Let her kiss her fiancé and her brother. We'll be late for mass. Here's your engagement gift. Wear it this night of Resurrection. You've lost everything. You've lost me... You've lost yourself. There's a curse on you. Your father was cursed when he conceived his rotten, stinking son. What's wrong, Katina? What's the shouting about? On the night of the Resurrection. You'll make him mad. He won't rise from the dead again. They've stolen my son! They've killed his dog! They're going to jail. My daily bread. Who killed his dog? Who did it? Who ever saw, who ever heard of a boss an owner who'd steal and kill his own herd? Who'd destroy his own property? Men and goats? Shut up, fool! Your mother's right. You're worthless! Where were you hiding when your dog was killed? You're a liar! No sense of honor. Go somewhere else! Go to hell! You bring bad luck! I beg you... send me away! Tell me to leave! To go to Australia. Let me go. Get up at once! Go to the big church. Wait for your boss! After mass, throw yourself at his feet! Beg him to forgive you. We both have to eat. I need a shave. When you're away, I'm dead. When you're back home, you're dead. To insult you feeds me. But soon you'll leave. I'll die of indigestion masticating abuse. I'll fetch a razor blade. The blue pearls! Come quickly! Listen to me! I've found it! Who's that? Who's shouting? It's me, Haralambos! I've found it. Are all our sheep dead? All of them! A spell's been cast. It turned to wind and swelled out their guts until they burst. Don't be silly! The spell's in your head. Shut up, Doc'! They burst because they breathed in an evil wind. A spell's been cast on us. I lost eleven sheep, all dead. All my herd! It's a cursed wind. They died through stupidity. Listen to him! You're cursed yourself. Inflated with evil! You'll burst. Get out of here! Let's chase him away. Wait! No need for that. Nothing'll happen to us. Look what I've found. What did you find? The eye of jealousy, of hatred! Of the evil spell! The evil eye. Throw him out! I was on Eagle Peak... searching for a remedy. For a long time I questioned. Then the "voice" answered me. "Tonight, Haralambos! I'll send them the truth. "Go to your village and give them the pearls! "I've chosen your village for tonight. "You'll be my messenger, my hawk!" Give us the pearls, messenger! Take this blade. Go home and shave. - What's he up to? - Be quiet! He's the smart guy. Give us the pearls. I must boil them first, mix them with herbs, follow the "voice's" secret instructions. I also want to know if you all agree to buy an icon as a token of our gratitude. We'll buy one! Bring me some milk, milked by a virgin. A little honey. The poorest villager must help me. Katina Zekos. Help me to drive the spell away from our houses, our sheepfolds. Our misfortunes will work together. Yes! Save us from the curse! Go and fetch the pearls, the milk and the honey. Yes. I'll swallow the pearl! I'll go to Communion. I'll swallow the pearl! I'll go to Communion. I'll swallow the pearl! I'll go to Communion. I'll swallow the pearl! Did all your bells ring when death struck them and the sheep died? Let's begin! For the icon. That's all I can give. They can put your son in jail. You won't starve. He didn't steal them. He's too stupid! I know. He's good for nothing. I'll offer up two candles to the Virgin. One for his brains. The other for protection. It won't help. His brain is numb. Then, that She may cure him. I've thought it over. I won't go to the police before Monday. What will people say? You don't send a poor man to jail at Eastertime. But Monday at dawn, he'll be inside. - Where were you all day? - In the village. Have you met Papadimas? No. Why? He's optimistic. Vlahopoulos didn't say no. He's an artful man. I hope he'll soon give his consent. Make a good impression on him tonight. Take this, Despina! It's all I've got left. That old witch! I like her. - Who sent the go-between? - Karavidas. He's so eager to get the dowry. - And the answer? - Was yes! Money attracts money. Like a woman a man. Give me the money but keep the girls! Son of God! Listen to a poor old woman... an unhappy mother You, who bear our sins... take one more upon you. My child's sins! Son of God, reconcile us. Reconcile our strayed brethren... the murderer and the victim... and all humanity. Unhappy creature! May the Virgin Mary hear you. May she hear your prayers. There he is! Thanos! The shepherd! He's wounded. To see you... he's defying the police... and maybe even death. Be quiet! By fanning the dim flame of generosity, you only inhale the ashes of ingratitude and lose goats. I hope you had him arrested. No, not until Monday. He took advantage of Easter to do his evil deeds. No mercy for killers! Yes, but his old mother... He should be jailed right away! How do you like the Army, Yankos? What a nice uniform! I like the Army. But my only wish is to get out to be nearer to you. Go on, Despina! I have good news for you. Let's wait for him a little further on. You'll be very pleased to hear it. It's about marriage. Where's Despina? Pericles! Wait for me, Karavidas. I'll go and get my daughter. You'll see, you'll be very happy. Come on... let's go up there. Are you crazy? We must wait for Vlahopoulos. My boss! Idiot! Stupid! Lousy swine! Why do you have to bother me here? At a time like this? Christians! Please help me! Ask him to listen to me... and not with his back turned. I'm his servant! If he were in jail, he wouldn't be here. It's not too late. No! Stay here! Look at me! In the name of God! Look at Thanos Zekos! Take a look at a thief! Get up! You dirty rat! Is he the shepherd? Get out of here! I'd put him in jail! I wouldn't... just for a few goats. For your son, Karavidas. Do it for his sake! May misfortune be mine forever! May your son get rich... remain with you... and be worthy of you! Get up! I want to show you that, in spite of everything, I'm generous and good. For the love of Jesus Christ, I won't send you to jail. I wish my father would disappear! Karavidas! Wait a minute! You can't leave him free. That thief! That bastard! You killer! You swine! Pansy! He should be jailed at once! Call the police! Let's call the cops. Come on! You can't do it! Think it over, Karavidas! For heaven's sake! You can't do that to society, to decent people! Vlahopoulos is right. Let's call the police. Forgive me, Vlahopoulos. Karavidas never goes back on his word. I've forgiven him. I'm Orthodox! Christ rose from the dead! My boss Karavidas! He's a blasphemer! He doesn't believe in anything. He's a dog! The Devil! What's he done? You refuse to have him locked up? I can't. It's too late. What would people say? But I'll throw him out. He can starve to death. The police! You're crazy! I won't! All right! Listen carefully! You're a respectable citizen. You're wealthy. You sent me your intermediary... for a marriage proposal. You have your eyes on the dowry. Only Vlahopoulos can give such a sum. You're a fellow-countryman of mine, I wouldn't have said no. But this scandal! In front of everybody... Watch what you say! I too gave my word. I won't go back on it. My son-in-law! Zakarias Soulas, a learned man! Let's go! Vlahopoulos, you'll pay for this! I'll get even with you. By God, I swear it. I'll get my revenge. Where's that thief son of a bitch? I'll get even with him too. Yankos, where are you? Où êtes-vous? They've insulted your father... dishonored me. Save my son! Forgive him! Where's Thanos? She's in the school. Hurry! She's crazy! If her father knew... he'd kill us all. She's waiting for me? The school's closed. Vacation! Hurry up! You know where the school is? Run! SCHOOL Thanos, come here! I was waiting for you. Come here. I must talk to you. I'm in a hurry. It's yours. Take it! You can sell it. It's my engagement gift. Take it and go away! Go abroad, to Australia. Quick! We've got to leave! I beg you, Thanos! Take it! I must go back. Pick it up, shepherd! Crawl! You do it so well. Bring it back to me. Be quiet, Loula! I'm coming. I can't wait any longer. Let's go. Get up! My shoes! Get up! You'll walk bare-footed. Get up! I'm hungry. Let's go! Go? Where? I must... You brought me this necklace. You want me to sell it. No one would believe such a thing belongs to Thanos Zekos. They'd arrest me. Come with me. We could sell it together. Unless you want me arrested, although you pretend to save me? If you want to save me, go ahead. Don't let me down half way, I might sink. Let's go! The... shepherd... he... wants to kill her. Come Zaharias! Catch her! Yankos! It's you? Go to hell! - I'm waiting. - For whom? Your father. Who else? - Where is he? - Looking for them. Come here immediately, Despina! It isn't Despina, Father! It's Loula. She... Where's Despina? Only she knows. But she's had a shock! She's become dumb. Catch her! Stop! She needs a sedative and rest. To the veranda. Quick! A chair! No, a couch. She must relax. Where's Despina? Water! Where did you find her? - On the ground. - Where? In front of the church. And Despina? Where's my daughter? Tell me! Don't be afraid! Unfortunate but wealthy father! Listen to me! Who are you? What do you want? Don't get excited! Look what heaven's sending you. What happened to you, my precious daughter? It's her shoe. It isn't too late. You daughter's alive and unharmed. But not for long. You'd better hurry. Put 3000 drachmas into her purse and throw it over the wall. And I'll tell you where she is and with whom. For a small portion of your fortune, I'm offering you your honor so that you can save it. Hurry! One more minute and I'm darkness! Prepare yourself. She's with Katina's son... the shepherd. I can't tell which one's leading or which one's following. You're playing the fool. Where were you? You forced me to bow and scrape for you. Get up! Who is it? Get up! It's Haralambos. I'm waiting for Karavidas. I must soften him up. It's too late to beg. Charity's over. Go back home! Where's my son? A girl offered him her necklace. She said: sell it and go away. He refused. He's got what he wants. The girl and a world of ashes. - Is she rich? - It's her! My son is born! I've some things to buy at the store. Come! Throw it as hard as you can. I don't want to. I'll do it if you like. With all your might. Kneel down! On your knees, Karavidas! What? Everyone's gone crazy. Where's my son? He's in danger. He thinks he's engaged. He didn't witness your shame. I'm going to bed. Dressed for battle, complete with knife, he's chasing after his fiancé, the dowry and his honor, kidnapped by this lady's son. I don't believe it! His battle-dress is missing, so is his knife and is he. Only I can tell you where they're meeting, your son and hers. Where's Yankos? I beg you. He's my only son. Tell me where he is. For God's sake! Kneel down! Lick! Lick, Karavidas! Don't forget to call me to tell me what your father... It's no use. It's too late! Wait! Everything can be arranged. Despina may not be... Go on! Get going! There you go again! On the route to revenge! You'll need wings. Thanos is close to the sky. Good! The deeper he'll fall into his own hell! Better a poor son-in-law than a whore of a daughter and a name a dog would be ashamed of. You're nothing anymore... nothing! Just rotten flesh and bones under the sun. Go ahead! Get going! Perched on these obelisks, you should tower over these little things. Go ahead! Parthenon! No! Don't beat me! J'avance! You hurt me! Why do you hit me, you damn shepherd? I'm walking. Why do you say: you hurt me, you dirty whore? I'm whipping you. Thief! Call me a thief! Dirty shepherd! I'm not any more. Neither dirty nor clean. You beggar! I'm carrying the flag I won from your family: You! The loot's in the bag. Puanteur! I'm a ravisher of honor. I emasculate. You son of a bitch. Please, don't do it again! Yes, you're a bandit. A big bandit... A killer! I love you! I love you. You thief! You murderer! Kidnapper! I love you... Dishonor. Ashes of my family. Remains of my name. The sun rises today... on a reconciled land... on Greek soil. Long live the Revolution! I love you, you demolisher! Don't leave me! I'm leaving you, my love! Take it! But why? Why are you doing this? It's a crime. Why is it a crime? It's your crop. A whole year's labor. No, dentist! Get this straight! This crushed tobacco is nothing but our honor. But it's murder. I'd go to prison. Murdered... dishonored? You already are. To vindicate one's honor... is lightly punished in Greece. You'll soon be free and your honor restored. This soil is yours. Don't let it be dishonored. For the last time! I'll use it... to kill you... to kill your mother, your sister... I'll be the last to go. Since we've this store... American methods... Brand new shoes... Silence! My radios! Mr. Mayor... Who? The Governor? An example? All right! I'll follow your instructions. Yes, Thanos Zekos! He signs his crimes. Does he know how to write? Well... Stop! It's me, Yankos. Stop! Don't come near! Get back! I've come to help you. What happened? Go away! Don't look at me! I've found your shoes. Go away. Go back to where you come from. Go to hell! What's the matter? What did he do to you? It's none of your business. I'll take care of it. What did that criminal do to you? Don't you understand? I've come to rescue you, to get even. But first I want to know: did he... are you still? I'm still alive. My name's Vlahopoulos. Soiled or spoiled, I'd kill myself. Go away!! My family's coming to kill the scoundrel who dared... No. I'll kill him myself. Tell me where he is. For the last time, go away! They might mistake you for Thanos. But I'm your fiancé. Who said so? Your father, in front of the church. I've been looking for you. Loula told me... that this lackey... this shepherd... in the school... Shut up! Never mention... his name to me. Not before he's killed... trampled to death... this spittle! He kidnapped me... in front of the church... threatened me with his knife. He dragged me to the school... intending to rape me... He beat me. He threw me down... That's enough! Where's he hiding? I'll drive him out. Not so fast! I want to see him die in front of my eyes... see him punished... Come, Despina! Stop! Save my son! Save him! Stop! In the name of Jesus Christ! Archimandrite! Who dares? On this day of Resurrection... I beg you to save my son. He's in danger! He's a criminal, a bandit! At this very moment... a father's carrying death to his child. She's a whore! Save her, save my son! In the name of He... whom you pretend... to represent... Silence! My power is spiritual.
