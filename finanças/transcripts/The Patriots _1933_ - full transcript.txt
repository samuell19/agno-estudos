The present Contract on the supply of boots to the army at the price of..." With a rasp, with a rasp. Clean harder, harder. Move like that, like that. Forward, German infantry! They were singing. "The Fortress on the Rhine” And our brave cavalry was finally chasing after them. The artillery, with its big guns and courage like old Fritz Cannons rumbling one by one, A wall of bayonets flashed like lightning through the open air And finally they called "Halt!" - Hello, Robert Karlovich. - Hello.

OUR VALIANT TROOPS HELD THE FRONT LINE OF THE ENEMY, HAVING SEIZED RICH BOOTY AND PRISONERS. You scoundrels, betrayers of Jesus, you're all around here... you have to be shot. You dirty Russian pigs. You will have to pay the price for all of us. To the camp for prisoners of war: Due to difficulties with food, as of today prisoners of war are permitted to leave the camp and go into the city to look for work from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Signed by Colonel... What's the watch? No, no, how... how much? What time is it? What time is it, sir? 7:00. It's 7:00 already. [ Have to get back to the base. They lock it at 7:30. After work, we can go to town, but we have to be back on time. I asked for work all over town. I am a shoemaker. Do you understand? But everybody tells me, "We don't have any work for Germans.” Russian soldiers at the front were not as hostile as the people here in town. Do you understand? You look a lot like my little sister, but she's shorter than you. I haven't heard from her in a long time. I think my little brother will soon have to join up. I hope he doesn't end up 'on the Western Front, but in Russia instead. That's better than Verdun. Do you understand? No, I don't understand. It's okay. I have to go. It's late. Goodbye. - Who's here? - Keep it down, for God's sake. It's okay. Keep it down. - Would you like to eat? - With great pleasure. - With great pleasure. - What? What? "With great pleasure. Pleasure.” "With great pleasure.” Do you speak German? We had Robert Karlovich, an elderly German. He left 2 long time ago. They played checkers with my father all the time. He was the one who taught me. Why didn't you tell me earlier you could speak German? We could have had such a nice conversation coming back. I thought you didn't understand a word. - Yes. - What, yes? Do you have a knife? Right away. Would you like some tea? I didn't come to have tea. What's the last name of your guest? - Mueller III. - What? Mueller III. Third... they had three Muellers in their army. Look, dear Third. Do me a favor, tum around and get out. I insist that you leave. Get out of here. He is a shoemaker as well. Get out of here, ugly German mug. He is a shoemaker as well. It's a shame, Alexander Petrovich. Stop teaching me! I have teachers better than you. Where's the way out? - The way out? - Yes, yes. There. Anka. Thank you for everything. Sao long. Hey! Take it out and show it. Are you a shoemaker? Yes, I am a shoemaker. You know what? Let's go. You'll work for me. I used to work from home as well. Let's go, let's go. You shouldn't cry now. Now we're in war, and before we win... we can't feel sorry for our enemies. You should be with us body and soul We are doing the right thing. Hello, hello. - Maybe you'd like some tea? - I don't feel like it. Why is he here? Listen, give me the horse. - Have you seen my folks? - No, I haven't. Goon, sew. Boy, what's wrong with you? Master, his legs are broken. What a hell. Master, what should we do now? If he dies, I'll die, too. Why are you talking about the horse and yourself, when all of Russia is crying? The entire Russian nation doesn't spare the power and lives of its best sons in the great heroic war to defend our Motherland. Russia will come out of that great struggle revitalized and strengthened. It's not the time for despair, when our hearts are full of joy, and the idea of victory near. The victory is close, victory only. Hit the Germans, defeat the Germans... complete and definite victory. We'll get you out of this dirty hole. There is no other way. Mail. You've got mail. "To Peter Ivan Gadki for me. "Dear Peter Ivanovich, with deep sympathy, we inform you that your older son, Nikolai Petrovich, is in the hospital with minor injuries and your younger son, Semyon Petrovich, was killed during an attack.” When the soldiers march through town The girls will open windows and doors... What could be nicer and more beautiful? What could be nicer and more beautiful? Stop singing. I told you to stop! What did you do? Get out! Get out of here! Get out! Get out of here! Hit the Germans! Beat the Germans! Beat him! Beat the Germans! Stop, scoundrels. So what if he is German? He's still a shoemaker like us. What do you want? You should disperse. Go, go- My Senka was killed. Take him to the bed. Move, move. He's not permitted to go out anymore, since it causes a big ruckus. Go away, go away. Pick him up. Anka, come home, you brat! Then a Russian patriot came, and he knocked me down... simply because I'm German. Then a girl came, she was nice to me. If it hadn't been for her, they would have killed me. Compatriots, have you heard? Our Tsar has abdicated. - You're lying. - Who's lying? What a rush! What a rush! Brothers, friends, citizens... the rising sun of revolution has destroyed the tyranny. Hello, Alexander Feodorovich. I don't have time, I don't have time. I greet you on behalf of the Provisional Government. Free citizens of free Russia, hurrah! Now the Duma of people will govern. Duma... To hell with the Tsar. We can assume that there will be no war anymore. We can assume that from the landowners... the land... What a rush! War is over. 'The land will be... Attack.

No, he doesn't. Explain to me, my dear... 'we don't want to fight, they don't want to fight, but still, this is the fourth year that we've been fighting. Where are you going, Nikolai? Let me talk. Every scoundrel, German agent, Bolshevik, spy and traitor, is appealing for fraternization on the front. At this very moment, when the country, covered in blood, is fighting against the external enemies, the Bolsheviks betray the Motherland. The Bolsheviks disintegrate the army. On behalf of the Provisional Government, I declare... - Shoot those scoundrels! - Don't disturb me, let me talk. On behalf of the Provisional 'Government, I declare, with no mercy, we will destroy soldiers, traitors calling for fraternization and disintegration of the army. Nikolai! Nikolai! Artillery, shoot the traitor of the Motherland. Shoot! My dear Nikolai... Don't give rifles to the commanders. Deputies, soldiers... the Winter Palace has been captured. Anka! Sit down and play! Stop! What's the matter? - We've arrived, get off. - Go to hell! - I told you, we've arrived! - I won't get off. We Kindly request you to get off. - I'm submitting to violence. - As you should! Peter, arrest him! Getup. Getup. Get up, Kolya. Kolechka. Kolechka! Kolya. - What do you want? - Get up. Now. What a rush! The End.
