Put your twos up! Put your twos up! Put your twos up! Put your twos up! Put your twos up! Hey! Hey! Hey! [MAN PRAYING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: ...just thanking you Father God for your goodness. Thank you for your emotion. Thank you, dear God, for your endurance that you have kept us through this whole tour. We thank you, dear God, for everything that we've accomplished, dear God. And no mistakes, and no casualties, dear God, and no tragedies came about. We give you thanks, dear God, because we know, without you, we can do nothing. but with you, we can do all things. So, right now, we just ask, dear God, that you continue, dear God, and keep us. Keep us in the midst of your control, dear God. We know there is a day you'll be coming in our dwelling. Bless us, dear God, during the after party and protect us from all hurt, harm and danger. Give your servants stamina, dear God, the energy to do all he has to do, Lord God. We are thankful for everything. But we know it is from you. Amen. ALL: Amen. -Yeah! -MAN: Whoo!

At the time that I needed someone, he couldn't have came at a better time. He's like a father figure to me. Hey, this is the American sandwich. That's what I was bringing Future. This is why we were coming back, when he first was on that mix CD on that swag season or whatever. This is where I first heard it at, in this... They always keep one of the boys in the hood working back there. This is his favorite wing spot, actually, on the West Side anyway. [MAN SPEAKING] -Yeah. -Used to be... Always 20-wing in the medium lemon pepper sprinkle. Sometimes in the hot Teriyaki, he like it. And then salad. -Sometimes salad. -Yeah. This is one of the... my personal favorite little wing spots on Camelton or whatever. But ironically Future's, it's one of his spots, too. When we was at the old Dungeon that was off of Cascade or whatever, me and him had this, it was like, we called them crack wings because it was like, you know what I mean, we had to have a medium with the lemon pepper sprinkles as a wake up. See mom and pops there asking me about getting Future to come back up here to see 'em or whatever. Wound up it was swag season, one of the early mix CDs that Future was on when I heard his vocals on it or whatever, like I was in here. They was playing it in the back, and I was like, it sound like my cousin. I'd only heard from Rico Wade from Organized Noize. And I knew that, you know, they were working on Da Connect. They had, like, you know, the crew and I moved to California by then, so I wasn't at the Dungeon every day in that way. I was in California working, and so when I came back, I heard this new music and I was like, "Who is this dude?" You know, it's Future, dude, you know. I was like, it's jamming. And then he comes to find out it was Meathead. RICO: Meathead was early on, like when he first came around me. And that was just what we called him. And that was his nickname since youth. So I feel like even his transformation over to Future became just because he was the future. I was at a funeral when I saw him, and I was like, you know, you put it together like... Oh, so that's your daddy, okay that's my Uncle Boo. Okay. That's your... Oh, boy. Come on. Come on to the house with me tonight. You know what I'm saying? This is how he was brought to me from my dad and my brother. You know, they was out on the street, you know, doing dirt and would come to the Dungeon and hide out a little bit. RICO: He got shot. This kind of stuff happened early on that threw him off at the time when he was supposed to be focused on certain things. I think it was just for him to even see somebody else doing something else my cousin, Rico, doing it. You know he's doing it like on a whole another level with OutKast and Goodie Mob and that kind of thing. So probably him, he's like, I can do this. We can have this shit. We don't have to dream about it no more. Like this is obtainable. That's just says a lot to his personal journey, man. Like it also says that he didn't lean on anything that we tried to do, or he didn't try to mimic anything that we tried to do to try to, you know, kind of slide in. He didn't slide in. He worked his way up. He worked it. RICO: Sound is not necessarily indicative of Dungeon Family but that's where he came from. If I didn't meet Future when I met him, he most definitely wouldn't have been the Future. I don't think that music itself would have ever happened for him.

And me being in the Dungeon and walking and seeing Andre lay down verses that came out to the masses and me just watching it and just soaking up the game and being a listener and being a fly on the wall... man, it'll like damn near bring tears to your eyes, knowing the work that I put in because being in the Dungeon and seeing him recording those verses, man, seems so far away. And music just was my escape. Just me not settling for the person that I was. The person I felt like I was becoming. I just wanted something better for my life.

It was another record coming like, "What's that?" And another one came on. It was still him and I was like, I gotta meet this guy. I just remember the feeling of seeing the change happen. From a time period when all you heard was Gucci, Jeezy and Tip, you know what I'm saying? It was like, okay, like, here's the transitional period where these guys are now, you know, the new sound coming out. I mean, Future was the front runner and the leader, and he was just... He was a problem, like record for record. -How'd you get put on? -The Dungeon Family. You know, cousin Rico Wade, I started through the Dungeon. So salute to Rico. And then I did the Racks on Racks when I wrote the Racks on Racks. Things just took off from there. You just said you wrote Racks. You wrote that song? Yeah, yeah, I wrote Racks. DJ SPINZ: You know, he was coming with something different. He had his first records in the club, which was probably digged up by T.I. You know, that was the first taste. And then after that, it was Racks with YC. That kind of shifted the sound of what was going on. It was like, oh, this is some next shit. I'm around a lot of rappers. I'm around a lot of artists. I've seen a lot of them from the beginning, you know, up until where they are now, and he's one of those guys that it's like, man, this guy's a star. I think everything he touches gonna turn to gold like, you know, he's the truth. He's one of the best of our time. And music is what drives him. That's probably what you know, makes him feel alive right now. ♪ Aye, my mama said ♪ Fuck it, nigga Hit the streets and live ♪ Got some crack in the corner ♪ And I did what I did ♪ The neighbors They don't like me ♪ I got J's at the door ♪ Told my grandma I don't need a bed ♪ I'm sleeping on the floor♪ NARD: He really is like in the forefront of the wave. No one can deny the fact that he's opened the door for so many people. So many artists in Atlanta. And not just artists, producers too. He influences everybody. Everybody right now in this day and age in hip hop, I think so. His work ethic is crazy. It's like, unbelievable, bro. DJ KHALED: This man works every day. This man don't sleep. He records everywhere he goes. He could do a show here in the studio. He can wake up in the afternoon, in the morning, here in the studio. He would be on a private jet, three shows a day. He's still going in that studio. He don't stop. Shit. When you love to create just as much as you love to make money, it's a beautiful thing. [CROWD CLAMORING] WOMAN: Future, we love you! FUTURE: I really don't take my fans for granted. I'm trying to get through to the people who don't speak English, to people who do speak English, who grew up with a father who grew up without a father, who sold drugs, who didn't sell drugs. It don't matter, like, I'm trying to get in your heart. I'm trying to get in your soul. [CROWD CLAMORING] I'm giving them a lifestyle they think about. I'm giving them a lifestyle they could dream about. I'm giving them a lifestyle they probably never wanna live. You can do it your way and you can apply all the great things that about me, and you're going to apply to your life and you can be able to be a greater person than me. You can take the bad from me, and you could be like, I don't want to do that. Cause I'm being completely honest about what's going on in the world. It's just like seeing in, you know what I'm saying? They showing people blowing up, they showing people killing, like how the fuck they're gonna show the car blow up for real. They just showed them up, but really get shot. You seeing the police really shooting the kid on the Internet. You seeing this shit. They're not blurring it out or nothing. They're just like me. Why I got to blur out my lyrics? You're not blurring out when the police just shot a man 37 times. Like so it's just everything is unfiltered, man. This raw footage. It's raw music. [MAN SPEAKING] Selling crack. Selling crack. -[LAUGHS] I'm fucking. -[MAN LAUGHING] I was the best. I could sell crack better than anything I wanted I couldn't invent. Like people gotta know how to stay in their lanes. I can talk to a junkie the best to make them feel like I care. Like I did really care. I used to be like I might serve a junkie some crack and I'll be like, man, why do you smoke this shit? Like go home to your family and try to talk to them. You build a relationship. And then you start looking at them like, man, they ain't even junkies no more, man. They start becoming friends. You know, and it's like it's crazy. This is a crazy lifestyle, bro. It can get deep. There's no rules until it is dirty. It's filthy, it's nasty, it's like... It's something that you don't never want to become because once you become it, it captures your soul, it captures your heart, it captures your way of thinking, it captures everything and once you're gone, man, it's hard to cut. It might be the hardest thing to get out that shit. Somebody stole some money from you, stealing from you... You know what I mean? You got to go and do some shit to a person. You know what I mean, like, it's back and forth with that shit. I ain't trying to go back and forth for these niggas. ANDRE: I think everything is made. Nothing is born, you know. Everything is made. So if you've become a rock star, you've made yourself in that way and it has to be respected. Me and my son, like we're Future fanatics, man, and we sit and we listen to it and I say, man, Future makes the most negative inspirational music ever. You see, he's talking about killing a man like in a week. But at the same time, if you're saying I'm flying first class flights on you pussy niggas, it's like that's a celebration, you know? We made our own money. You know, now everybody discusses, you know, the trap genre and, you know, that whole genre of rap, and they try to discredit it or, you know, make it bigger than what it is. And I listen to a lot of the artists and one thing I can say is Future has a certain pain behind what he's doing, and you can call it soul, you can call it whatever, but to me it comes off as pain. That's what it comes, straight off as pain and now I'm going to let y'all watch me balance the pain, and we're all on edge watching it. Like, yeah. All my savages in the building are the fellas done showed up. I see y'all all the way in the back. Hands up all the way in the back.

I was in like high school when... when I got shot, it just changed my mentality. I didn't... I really didn't care about life as much because I felt like that day I was supposed to die like that. I could have died that day. Sometimes it would be like, damn, why me out of all these people? How did I get here? Taliban, we wearing it. My little chain be costing ten and twelve thousand.

Esco is my road DJ, my friend, my brother. It's fulfilling to see someone that you know, loyal to the whole camp. And loyal to my dreams and being behind me with his music from day one and get recognition. So many DJs play a major role in my career. Being able to spin these records. They're like family now. Man, Esco told me he went to college for psychology. And after ever since he told me that, he got to pick my music because he psychologically know what people thinking. He's not just gonna make the first move, and I feel like that's good because sometimes you react off emotions. And when you're making a album is not good to be emotional because you don't want to have a song full of your emotions or however you feel. I feel like to make the album complete of my vision, the way I really want to come across and not how I felt that day, or not how I felt the day before is to let someone else do it. He makes so much music that he can't, uh... It's hard to filter it all when you're making hundreds of songs and you forget what songs you made 93 songs ago. You know what I mean? But we can pull it back up and say, "Yeah. We remember this." And then he'll come back in. And so he trusts our ear on that part, that the streets will respond to what we think is hot.

It's me telling the truth. Me telling you the real me, and me telling you how these records came about. I remember really having some Gucci flip flops on and I always got them, I was, you know, what I mean? I was smashing a bitch at the penthouse, right by the door with my Gucci flip flops on. This ain't no disrespect. You know I mean, I really lived that moment, and I went to the studio, I went directly to the studio. You know, he walked in. He had the Gucci flip flops on or whatever. He's going through beats, played one beat, he loaded it up. And it just... I remember the tone of his voice just when he was like, "Dirty soda, Spike Lee "White girl, Ice T "Fully loaded AP." I just made a face. I was like, "Man, what the fuck?" I didn't know I was gonna do that shit that day. And I was like, "Man, I just fucked your bitch..." "...in some Gucci flip flops" And he just kept going. I was like, yeah. This shit is crazy right here. ♪ I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci... CROWD: ♪ Flip flops! And it just came off the top of my head because it was a real moment. You know what I mean? That was, like, the first thing I just did. So it was just fresh on my mind. I remember around the same time we're doing Dirty Sprite 2 when he did Rotation. And he was like, "I had to smash lil' shawty with my jeans on "and I had my pistol in my pocket." I've been sitting down, you know, he had a little pistol whatever in his pocket, just, you know, all the way tucked in there and I was like, yeah. It was rewarding to see people react the way they reacted to real shit and raw shit and just me being honest and people that live their life the exact same way that I'm talking and these people are accepting it and the way they accepted it, because it's real. You know what I mean? It's possessive. It's music that's got feeling. You know what I mean? There's real life situations. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC] SETH: The studio is a church. This is where you're allowed to be whatever it is you want to be for whatever amount of time, because you go out those doors, that's real world. When you're in that booth, when you're in the control room, when you're witnessing really good music being made, it is different. There's some music that just is timeless. You can play whatever and a hit is a hit whether you like rap or not. Future has the ability to transcend a genre. He's not rap. He's not hip hop. It's just art. It's just music. Watching Future access what he has to, to get there, is the most impressive part. When you listen to him, he'll work out melody and let lyrics develop. So as it runs, when I hit record he'll say certain things that might fit. ♪ You keep it still You're ready for a walk And some of it's often gibberish because he's working out the melody, not the words. ♪ Hey, you burned that life ♪ So use some pretty good char ♪ It's a rented life ♪ So you prepared to catch a charge And once that melody kind of locks down for that next line... ♪ You burned that life ♪ So you're prepared to catch a charge♪ It's incredible to watch, and when I say watch, he's in the dark. You can't see him but you can hear it. ♪ You keep it still ♪ You ready for a walk ♪ You burned that life ♪ So you're prepared to catch a charge♪ It's timeless because he wasn't trying to be anything else. He was just giving you what he was at that very split second. The family comes in and I think he gets comfortable. He gleans a lot of what he says off of the conversations, that happen in the studio, whether it's couple of the guys in the back talking about some trap house they got, some dude like 10 days in the Bando, and that's why it couldn't get any more real. I mean, he's giving it to you right then. I got the call, it was saying Seth passed. It was like... It wasn't real to me, and you know what I am saying, to this day, it's still don't feel real. All my vocals still say Seth vocals, the same chair he used to sit in, I sit in and record. I spent more time with him than my family. I spent more time with him than my kids. I spent more time with him than anybody in the world. And him being from Kentucky and the part of Kentucky he was from, and how they was raised up, it was pretty much like a racist part like, of being... He's been in that racist town or whatever, man. And then meeting me when I'm totally different, totally the opposite of him. And we just bridging that gap, just like... It was like my best friend is white, you know what I'm saying, like, the person that I shared everything with is a white man. And every day, like when I'm in the studio, looking at the computer is not looking at him is just... not knowing that he right there it's like it's still... it still gets to me every single day is like, Not one day go by I don't think about him. When we started on Super Slimey with Seth having passed away... It was important for us together to put the project out. Seth loved it so much. He feel like, "man, it was a long awaited. Instead of beefing with each other, man, y'all work with each other, the world needs to see it." So the world needed to hear it. That's what we did. Catch that. Oh! I'm gonna put your ass on the Internet, boy. FUTURE: Me and Thug were going to studio just like as one. When we get on the track, and that's how much we feed off each other. I like to record a lot. He like to record a lot. When we're in the studio, both of us never want to leave. When you in it, you know what I'm saying, the more fit you are for it, you know, you can't call yourself a professional rapper and you're in the studio twice a month. You know what I'm saying, like, you know, you got to beat that shit up like it's your gym. So, and I see like his work ethic, man. I've never seen nobody like it. He's in the studio now, shit, if not more than when he started, and that's rare to me. You got times when this stuff is just it's coming out you, you know, you can't hold it in. So I got to get this stuff out. Yeah, just like an athlete that's on fire. Like, you know, Steph Curry. It's like, I'm a shoot from half court right now. Because, you know, that's how I feel right now. I feel like I'm making everything. He could just do a million songs. A million beats. Just right then in your face. Just back to back to back to back to back to back. He can be in a meeting, sitting right here and I'll play something and he'll stop the whole meeting, like hold on. And go on and rap a whole song. Like man, this guy's crazy. Like he's doing 10, 15 songs a night. He got like a 100 albums loaded. Like this ain't no lie. So he can come out with an album anytime he wanna come out with one. He can come out with a tape anytime he wanna come out with one. That's for real. Like done songs, ready to go. The first time I went to studio and we were just talking, he was like, man, that verse you did on Rick Ross album, man, that was... Whatever he said, he was like, man, he said, I would have chopped that off and made it into two like... Ten songs. You know what I mean? So, to me, I saw the work ethic. I saw okay, he's saying, you know, kind of like, kind of like in a dope sense, like take it, break it down. In this day and age of streaming, more content and the more stuff you put up is better. Like he's changing people's thought process. I don't care if we sell 500 copies or 1000, ten thousand, I don't give a fuck. I just want to get content. I want to get it out here now. Like at this point, it's almost like the more the merrier. You're in the streets and you had too much dope, I might look at it, you know what I mean, like, you probably want to keep sending it, I ain't got to be friends with the first pick. We're letting that shit overlap. You know what I mean? So I look at niggas who say that shit, you ain't got enough dope. You ain't got enough work ethic. We're going to run past you two or three times. If you know Future, you know he'd been broke before. He'd been kicked out of apartments and didn't have enough money so he know it. If you've come from that, you don't ever want to go back to that. So you know, anybody could fall on their face. All you got to do is stop working. So we got to keep working.

Try to get there quick. We got to hurry up. All right. FUTURE: I was sitting in the car, right, and I was just thanking God because I was like, man, I've been working so hard and I was like, may God really bless me, not just only for me having number one albums, but it goes beyond that. It's like the connection and the bond that I have with my kids. Man, it's a blessing. Like man, I thank him every day for it. And I was like, man, I just thank God for the connection to me and my kids, how they love me so much. And I love them back. So, man, it ain't even about speaking on somebody else. It ain't even about no one else but me. These are my feelings. This is how I feel. I'm not trying to embarrass someone else. I'm not trying to take away from their career. I'm not trying to take away from anybody's lifestyle. I'm not. And that's not my motive, man. I don't have ulterior motives. Don't have negative energy that I'm trying to give. I just want to be able to have a relationship with my kids that go beyond social media. I'm changing baby Future diaper. Know what I mean, like I'm putting my son in the tub or I'm listening to my little girl read a book because that's all she wants. Or she want to play the piano because she just learned something in her piano lessons. She want to be able to play me or she got swimming lessons or, you know what I'm saying? My oldest son, he want a drone, he wanted to know how to fly a drone and he want to shoot videos and he want a beat machine or you know what I mean? I'm getting on him by his grades, man. It's so much that I'm... It's my personal life, man. Like I don't have to argue with you in the comments. I got kids that I have to see after the, you know what I mean, and be there for on my spare time when I'm not working. I instantly have to get into daddy mode 24 hours a day. And snap out of it. They don't call me Future. They call me Dad. MAN: That nigga went too fast, boy. Y'all know it's too, uh... [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] My kids and shit in there. Make sure they pull in right there. Got it situated bro. -Okay, man. -MAN: What's up, bro? [ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Where the restroom at? MAN: Restroom ahead. Is the restroom ahead? Is he dressed? FUTURE: I pull up in my hometown in the Ferrari. Backstage, I'm walking in, about to hit the stage, before I hit the stage, my kids, my grandma and my family sharing these moments with me, I just got to give thanks to God. You know what I'm saying? He put it all together. I'm just working, I'm just working for him. [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING] [FUTURE VOCALIZING INDISTINCTLY] DJ ESCO: Let's hear y'all make some noise for Future Hendrix! [CROWD CHEERING] Three number one albums in less than seven months. I couldn't have did it without my hometown. Appreciate y'all. [CROWD CHEERING] -Future Hendrix. -He's Super Future. Fire Marshal Future, man. The guy's super hood. Actually, when I talk to him, I call him Jimmy Future. Future Hendrix, Jimmy Future. Future Hendrix is really just everything just rolled up in one blunt typeset. I think Future Hendrix quietly has already been on display. Like him wearing those hats, him wearing those hats, it's like I realized, like it's not far fetched. It's almost like he's trying to get more content in his lyrics as far as, you know, telling his story or whatever. ANDRE : He can go anywhere he wants to with the music. As far as Hendrix inspiration, I think the most thing that anybody can get from Hendrix is just being your full self and diving into it. You know, it's not putting a bandana on. I mean, that's cool if you want to do it like I did it as a kid. I was so influenced by Hendrix, but it's not... It's not necessarily, um... It's not anything about playing guitars. It's not anything about rock n roll, it's living. Yeah. It's living. It's just living. This is what rock stars are made of. You know what I mean? It's time to show and prove. Like he's been Future Hendrix since day one. Now watch out for whoever's coming next. [LAUGHS] Must for who's coming next.

[CROWD CHEERING] Normally it's the steak, the baked potatoes and the broccoli. That's pretty much his favorite. One thing about him, he gets excited about helping someone else. You know, when you see how many people around you that you've been a blessing to, and how many families that you have faith, God has allowed you to be in that position to be a blessing to others. That's where it comes from. It's not even so much about him. It's about everybody else that's around him that keeps him in the studio.

Like, nigga, I just came from a 2000 seater on this same... He was filming this shit. The venue was fucking, god damn, 2500 people, 1500 people. During Purple Reign, the biggest venue probably was 3500 people. And further thinking like, man, nobody's safe till you got the fucking heat on you, this person... All these fucking rappers, man, something bad gonna happen, but I got to work this shit. I already said nobody's safe. Why the fuck you named the tour this name? And they're mad about the name on that. The tour name was god damn X Off Derivative. But I'm like, that's the only way the tour gonna work. By the time I got Mask Off, I'm like, they know they can't even play. They know we're finna get overdue. That one song was worth the album. -Yes, it was. -Nigga, that shit is crazy how that shit happen. Bro, out of all the songs we did, nigga, Mask Off wasn't even legit. The shit was on the radio, they thinking it's not a sample, but it got so big they were like, man, it's a sample. They didn't want to believe it wasn't a sample. And then they call Esco like, Man, he didn't tell you it was a sample? He like, yes, I knew it was a sample. Yeah. I'm like, I just put it on the Internet. MAN: And it was a YouTube sample. For him to put that one on there and it didn't get cleared. He never tell nobody, though. Had this in his head. I'm gonna get him for this playlist and make them think this shit. And then when we turn to real play and listen, he got down, slide this song again and they ain't really catch the slide yet. But it's already out. They can't say nothing. Then, while I was just playing it to them, the whole aura behind Mask and how big it is, the people calling from it and knowing nigga, they got there, this nigga god damn did all this shit. About the song, that Mask Off, shit, Hendrix was down. And negative shit won't even got them cleared for the album if they put it on the Internet, on the playlist. I made that shit in the studio, I never made a song sitting down until I made Mask Off. After that shit I'm like, "man, I made this shit sitting down." Nigga, I will never stand up again. You talking about the booth, nigga, I used to be goddamn get mad about the booth. If Draco would have been the biggest song, I would have went right back to the booth.

I'm... Man, even when they called me to do an interview, man, I was just like super, super, super duper proud because we came from a time when... man, people just weren't listening to the South. Period. And so now you have kids in Brooklyn sounding like Future. So when Future goes to New York, I'm like, man, the night he went to New York for Dirty Sprite 2, I like just texted him and I said, "Man, turn that shit out, man." Because you got to think from the South, we always looked up to people in New York or in LA so even our first time doing a show at the Tunnel, in New York and the Tunnel, was like the grimy. That was like the place. You know, it's kind of like... Tunnel, you know, is people standing like that with razor blades in their mouth like, you know, and we rocked them. But you have to gain the respect, man. You've got to go in there and get it. And so, yeah, I'm super proud of Future, man. He's already won Grammys to me. You know what I mean? Like he's changed the course of things. So even if he never... Jimmy never won a Grammy. So if he never wins a Grammy, it's cool. If he does, it's awesome. But he's already done what he needed. Like if he never puts out another album, he's done for my life what he needed to do, and probably a lot of other people. So really, at this point, it's just extra shit at this point. You know, we just kind of loving it. But I do know that there's more albums on deck that we ain't heard yet. You know like multiples of them, and we want to hear all of them. All of them. Yeah. FUTURE: Man... Free my niggas. Free my brothers. My brother, Chuck, all right. It's hard being here. He's not here. You know what I mean? Him being locked up, incarcerated... it's like one of the hardest things, the challenges that I had to face... during my music career, man, it's crazy, man. My granddad are not here to see this. He wanted this for me so bad because he was like, "Man, what is he gonna be?" And he didn't get a chance to see what his grandson have become. The fucking magnificent change that I made as a person, as a grandson, and there's so many people that shedded blood, they don't even get a chance to experience the life... Dead and gone that wanted to see me here. They just wanted to see me be a great person somehow and change the way I was living. They didn't get a chance to see it. And it bothers me. You know what I mean? I gotta work through that. I gotta... find a way to block it out of my mind. So why are you smiling? You see me smiling. I'm happy. At times, you know what I'm saying, but at times I got to think about the people that is not here. At times it's affected me. You know what I mean?
