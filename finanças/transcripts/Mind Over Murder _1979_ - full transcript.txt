[traffic sounds] [screaming] You. [music playing] DIRECTOR: Four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four. Here it comes Suzy. All right. Spaghetti. Suzy, now. Try me. I'm delicious. DIRECTOR: Hold the smile. Hold the smile. Hold the smile. Hold the smile. Got it. OK. Next set up. Suzy, great fun. DIRECTOR: Clear the set everybody. Let's go. Let's go. Clear the set, everybody. Let's go. Let's go. Suzy, that means you. Bye. [inaudible]. I gave Morris Levy baby the old heave-ho. You should've seen his face. Wasn't he the guy that just last week you intended to spend the rest of your life with? ACTRESS: Same Morris Levy? You even replanned his whole life. ACTRESS: Not to mention his whole house. ACTRESS: I never liked that [inaudible]. [screaming] Ah. I got hit. Are you OK, Suzy? Oh. Sure. Come on. Let's get out of here. [disco music playing] -Hi. -Hello. Where's Jason? I thought he was coming with you. Working. Boring. Come on. Give him a break, Pierce. It's not a unforgivable sin to be ambitious. It is if you don't have an ounce of humor. Come on. Talk about the guy I'm living with. OK, OK. I didn't say a thing. Listen, whatever you do, don't look. Don't. He's behind you over there. Who? The guy I'm going out with Friday night. Table to your left, [inaudible]. (IN SLOW MOTION) He's with a guy and a girl. He's got a V-neck sweater. [ominous music playing] (HIGH PITCHED) Well, is he alone? [disco music playing] Suze, is he? Suze, are you all right? What is it? (LAUGHING) You OK? Wow. Suzy. I'm home. Where are you? Upstairs. Looks like it's one of them days. Lately it's always one of them days. Don't even get a good evening kiss? Too ugly. Suddenly, the clock ticking away. He fades back. Quarterback Jerry King back. Here's the blitz. The blitz is on. Blitzing. Watch the blitz. ---stop him. King fades back. It's a long one. -Hmm. Jason. Billy the Bullet [inaudible]. [inaudible]. Yeah, right. Hmm. Just trying to stay healthy today. Right. What happened? Well, I was was sitting in [inaudible] today, and she asked me if the guy at the next table was with the girl he was sitting with. Yeah, sounds like Pierce. What are you doing? Listen, would you, please? Yeah, what? When the girl was smoking a cigarette, smoke stopped in midair and the music stopped. Everything just slowed down and stopped. You're kidding. What did Pierce do? She stopped too. She was frozen. Pierce wasn't talking? Jason! What is that, a punchline? Is this a joke? Would you listen to me? Yeah. And then, when everything had stopped and no one was moving, A man smoothed his head. He was bald. What's so funny? You look fantastic. Are you listening to what I'm telling you? Yeah, I'm all ears. You said a girl was smoking and the smoke stopped in the air. And then everything slowed down and stopped, and Pierce lost her tongue and a bald man smoothed his hand over his hair. I heard every word. But it's true. Well, I didn't say I didn't believe you, did I? But you don't, I can tell. Would you come up here and cuddle into me? You rat. You don't believe me. You smell good. I sound like a crazy, don't I? It sounds sexy and wonderful. Turn out the lights. What about dinner? Later. Hey, Jason! JASON: What? Your steak will be ready in two minutes. OK. Put a squidge of garlic on mine, will you? I did. [explosion sound] PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): No light on the number one fire model. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): Roger. I read that. I'm going to try to snuff it. Depressurize the aircraft. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): We're getting a yaw SAS light. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): We got to set her down fast. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): She's starboard heavy. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): I know. She's starting to roll. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): We're in a blackout. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): I can't hold her Joey. She's getting away from me. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): She's rolling. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): Help me, Joey. Hold her. PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): I can't stop her. [screaming] PILOT'S VOICE (VOICEOVER): Here she goes. Here she goes, Joey. [plane crashing] Oh, my God! Honey? What's a matter? Suzy? -A plane crash! -What? A plane crash. I heard the people! What are you-- Oh, it's awful! [music playing] How you feeling today? SUZY: Much better. Well, that's good. Had me worried last night. Thought you were having a heart attack or something. Hey, I left the new Wheatley campaign somewhere. Did you see it? I put it behind your desk over there. Oh, good. You know, Jason, what happened last night was really bizarre. Could you pour me a cup of coffee, honey? I'm running late. Down to 145-- no sugar. It was almost as if-- JASON: Hey, Bill Laskey was asking about you yesterday. Think he's taken quite a fancy to you. Ought to have him over to dinner sometime. Doesn't hurt to butter up the boss. Jason, I'd like to talk to you about last night. OK. Well, we'll talk about it as soon as I get home, all right? It was so real. Frightening. Like a plane was actually crashing in our kitchen. Suz, you know what we both need? Is a weekend in Carmel. Think about it. [music playing] [tires screech] [upbeat music] Tony, you're selling hamburgers, not corsets. Loosen it up. Suzy, you are late. -I'll be just a second. [inaudible]. [paper crinkling] [ringing] This, uh-- [phone ringing] Hello? Can I talk to you for a minute? Hi, baby. How's it going? Uh, listen, it's a little hectic right now. I'm going bananas with this Wheatley campaign. Did you see the papers this morning? JASON: No, why? There was a plane crash. It happened last night. You're kidding? It was the one I heard. Suzy, now listen. It's a coincidence. Jason, I'm telling you. It's the one I heard. Look, can we save this for tonight? Things are popping right now. I've got to talk about it now. It's serious. JASON: Well, we'll talk about this tonight, OK? I promise. Jason. Jason. Jackson. Jackson. Henri Jackson-- spelt with an I. H-E-N-R-I. Excuse me-- He was supposed to be on Flight 802, but-- Excuse me. He must have missed it. I mean-- Right this way. Come here. Now if you just go to counter three, I'm sure they can help you. What about the cockpit tapes, Mr. Glazier? No comment. Have you found them yet? No comment. When are you going to release any transcripts? No comment. They went down in that industrial area by LAX. Lots of political influence. They've been pushing very hard. I've held them off so far. Good man. Joey. Did anyone call the pilot Joey? Was it a nickname? Uh, I can't answer that question. Maybe you should go to personnel. Or-- oh, Mr. Kushing. Mr. Kushing, there's someone you maybe should talk to. I can't quite make heads or tails of, well-- Hi. Ben Kushing, National Transportation Safety Board investigator. Can I help you? I hope so. What's the matter? I think I heard a conversation between the pilot of that plane that crashed and I guess his co-pilot. Well, I don't quite understand. How did you hear this. I don't know. I just-- just heard it. Well, we'll let that go for a minute. Um, what did you hear? The plane was in trouble, and the pilot was called Joey. Look-- look, I'm frightened. I don't know how I heard it. I mean, I've had strange things happen. I mean, weird sensations, like hearing and seeing. Unexplainable things. Ben. Kushing. Yeah, yeah. Just a minute. Look, would you mind? This is my assistant, Ted Beasly. I'm going to ask him to help you. I'd do it myself, but, uh-- Ted, as soon as you get her story down, get her together with John Povey. Would you do that for me, please? I think he should see her. Ted'll take good care of you. Thank you. Uh, Miss, step right over here. Do you mind if I use one of these? They save on secretaries. I want to give you John Povey's address. We worked together a while back on an American cargo plane that had disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle. He's an astrophysicist who's, uh, who's into psychic research. Let's start from the beginning. [music playing] Give me another refill, sweetheart. Huh? Pour me a glass of wine, please. Sorry, what'd you say? Sorry. OK, now what's wrong? Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Just a million miles away. Well, something's bothering you. Are you still mad at me because I hung up on you? No, I'm not mad at you. Forgotten all about it. What is it? Went to the airlines today. Jason, I'm just asking questions. Look, I know you don't believe in psychic things, but I just-- JASON: You're right, I don't. Please, Jason. Now, Suzy. Look, don't start getting hysterical on me like all your dancer friends always running off to fortune tellers-- It's not the same thing. This is different. -How? How is it different? This is a real problem, Jason. Something actually happened to me. Now, come on, honey. Now you keep going on like this and you're going to make yourself crazy. It makes me crazy when you don't listen to me. Now stop it. But I mean it, baby. You're going to spook yourself. I hate it when you call me baby like that. Yeah, well, best I can do. I haven't had any acting training. The airline guy believed me. Yeah, well, why not? He probably wanted to make it with you. Thanks, Jason. [dramatic music] Jason, Jason. What? Look in the mirror. OK. Go back to sleep, honey. About four years, give or take a few months. I'm a victim of the "English Brain Drain." Sold out to the filthy American dollar. In here. OK, well I take what is happening to you very seriously. I think it's serious. Do you understand? Yes, thank you. You're welcome. Now, let's talk about what is happening to you and why and-- [knocking] Excuse me. Yes? ASSISTANT: John, we ran back the [inaudible] and there's still no significant pre-am count. Then, I'd say we'll either run into the DB factor, or Houston screwed up. Can the Gods be wrong? I'm sorry, we're up against a deadline. We're always up against a deadline. Now we can agree, can't we, that you seem to be getting messages from somewhere outside yourself. Yeah. I'm-- I mean, I think so. Now stay with me. Everybody-- you, me, everybody-- all of our lives receive messages from somewhere outside ourselves. Are you aware of this? I don't think so. Most people aren't. See, generally, messages aren't strong enough to get through to the conscious mind. So we experience them as premonition hunches, things like that. I know those feelings. Of course you do. So does everyone else. But most people repress them, push them down. Just like they repress dreams. What's happening to you could happen to anyone, anytime. One day a leak can occur. The messages begin to [inaudible]. And the sound of the plane crashing? That was precognition-- sensing of future events. Technically, that's precognitive audio hallucination. You following me? As carefully as I can. [buzz] JOHN: I don't have the connection yet, but there's a possibility that your visions foreshadow an impending personal experience. [buzzing] I think they want me. Stay in touch with Kushing. He's a good man. SECRETARY: I think it's coming up red alert, Mr. Povey. We're always on a red alert. Where would life be without a red alert? I can't think you enough, Mr. Povey. Really. -Good, then don't. [horns honking] [indistinct audio playing] [tape rewinding] PILOT'S VOICE: Another light on the number one fire levels. PILOT'S VOICE: Roger, I read that. I'm going to try to snuff it. Depressurize the aircraft. PILOT'S VOICE: We're getting a yaw SAS light. PILOT'S VOICE: We've got to set her down fast. Ben, I want you to listen to this. [tape rewinding] PILOT'S VOICE: I'm going to try to snuff it. Depressurize the aircraft. It's the cockpit tape. Now listen. SUZY: Over the screaming, he said, I'm going to try to snuff it. Depressurize the aircraft. PILOT'S VOICE: We're getting a yaw SAS light. PILOT'S VOICE: We've got to set her down fast. SUZY: Then the other one said, we're getting a yaw SAS light. And something else-- wait a minute. Then someone else said we've got to set her down. [upbeat music] INSTRUCTOR: Five, six, seven, eight. OK, that's it, kitties. Take lunch. Suzy, if you don't mind my saying so, you look like [inaudible] dancing in a bathtub. I'm sorry. Just get with it, honey. Shape up or ship up. Suz, you're knocking your head against a brick wall. I mean, so what if you can't be Miss Corporate Image 1979. Try it alone. Different dancing partners aren't that bad, you know? You can't just give up when things aren't going well. At least I can't. Hi. Remember me? Yes. Hello. Hi. Hello. Uh, can I have a word with you? In private? Sure. I'll be in the corner doing my nails. Bye. Bye. I-- I hope you don't mind my coming here like this. No. I won't get in trouble or anything, will I? No. Well, what's a yaw SAS light? Excuse me? SUZY (ON TAPE): The other one said we're getting a yaw SAS light. I just heard it. I don't have any idea what that means. Yaw Stabilization Augmentation System. I don't suppose that rings any bells. We found the cockpit voice recorder of that crashed airliner. The recorded conversation was exactly as you heard-- everything. Every word, every detail. My boyfriend's beginning to think I'm a little strange. It doesn't surprise me that no one believes me. I believe you. Thanks. What I'm going to tell you now hasn't been made public yet, so you can't say anything. That plane crash was not an accident. Somebody put a bomb in it. Your psychic experience might give me a lead. I could use your help. OK. The vision-- the egg-- was that isolated? Was that the only one you had? I don't-- I don't know why, but there has been one occurrence. A bald man. I keep seeing the same bald man. He was [inaudible]. A bald man? Well, look, I'd like you to keep in touch with me. Phone me if you have another one of those visions, OK? Would you do that? Yes, I will. Oh, and I met John Povey. He's a big help. Thanks. Yeah, he's very knowledgeable in these areas. Well, thank you for giving me your time. Thank you. I'll keep in touch. Good. OK. Stopping by for your messages? How'd it go? FAA Regional, FFA Washington, Department of Transportation, Secretary of Transportation, FBI Local, your brother. Brother? What does he want? We've got most of the insurance reports now. A couple of passengers had pretty hefty policies, but they had them for years. Nothing there. [inaudible]. There wasn't anything there either, huh? No. I heard about something though. You know we've been going crazy trying to figure out how the bomb got on the plane? Yeah? It's not warm. Anyway, there was an incident the day of the crash. According to security records, it was "forestalled before it happened." It's warm enough. The guards saw a man climbing over the wall into the control baggage area. He got away. He was climbing over the wall into the controlled area. That's what the man says. Are you telling me nobody worked on the theory that he was climbing out of the controlled area? No. Was he bald by any chance? And how in the hell did you know that? Do they have video on him? Yeah, but not so that you could identify him. OFFICER: We're looking at the tape from camera two, the control baggage area's behind it. here's the underground entrance of the terminal. Now just a second-- he'll come out here. There he is. BEN: Yeah, hold it. Freeze it right there. All right, let it roll again. He's going down that line of cars. Headed for the underground entrance. Now that's the last picture we have of him. He spotted the two guys coming down through the terminal. Let's go to camera three. I tell ya, it does you good to get out with people. And you'll have fun at the game tomorrow. I promise. Who's this? Ben Kushing, NTSB? It's nothing. It's just a guy I met the other day. Don't look like that. I'm telling you, my nightmares are over. Come here. Come on. Jason? Jason? Honey, what's wrong? Jason? [screaming] Suzy! Take it easy. You're having a nightmare. [crowd cheering] Well, let's beat the traffic. Yeah, well, you're still not going to beat that bet. Yeah. What are friends for? Hit it. Well, it's true. Don't laugh. It's true. He got it up to the loft in the middle of the night, but what he didn't realize is you can get a horse up the stairs, but you can't get him down. (VOICE SLOWS) So the organist before the service starts. Looks down-- [indistinct slow speaking] No! JASON: Suzy! No! -Suzy! -No! Suzy! No! Suzy, this is really getting out of control. I mean, I don't know how to deal with this. SUZY: Neither do I. Now, look, you're going to have to go to a doctor or a psychiatrist or somebody-- It isn't like that, Jason. This is-- this is something else. This is different. Something is actually happening to me. Yeah. Look, I know you don't believe in these things, and I can't help that. I think these are psychic events. Suzy, I don't know how to talk to you anymore. I just don't. Why don't you go talk to your friends. Right. Here you go. Thank you. That'll set you free. There we go. Hello. Hi there. Have you been here long? Oh, a couple minutes. Thanks for meeting me. Why don't we walk a bit? Peanuts? No, thank you. So once the motor home started to move again, you didn't see anything more? No. Suzy, I got to ask you something. I don't want you to get alarmed. What? Do you own a striped yellow dress? Oh, no. No. The girl wasn't me. I'm sure of it. Why would you ask that? I just keep wondering if these visions of yours are some kind of warning. I mean, it just seems that way. You didn't have anything to do with that plane. What really bothers me is the bald man. On the day of the crash, we have a bald man on videotape escaping from the airport guards, and right now he's the only suspect I've got. And obviously, there is some kind of connection between the two of you. I don't even want to think of-- Oh, I know, but we have to. I-- I don't understand what you mean. Look, I talked to John Povey this morning. He takes it one step further. He thinks that these-- oh, what'd he call them? Precognitive audio visual hallucinations really mean what he called a lifeline intercept. Your paths will cross. [music playing] [rattling] Make nothing happen. Please. [honks slowing down] [indistinct voices] MALE VOICE: Please, it's very important to me. [indistinct voices] [loud honking] [tires squeal] [phone rings] Hello? Oh, hi, Suzy. Wait. Well, slow down, slow down. And that's what it means. I know it. He gave blood and he had to give his ID. I mean, I'm sure of it. Bloodmobile? There were people after him, and he was trying to escape. Of course, of course. OK, Suzy, thank you. Just leave it with me and I'll get back to you later. OK. Something up? Yeah, you bet there is. Come with me. Hold it, hold it. See? You see, he got inside the van just before it started to move again. He got a ride out of there. All it cost him was a pint of blood. Can you make out what it says on the side there? Uh, "give a pint, save a life"-- No, no. Anybody can read that. It's a bloodmobile. Now this down here. Uh, St. "Something" Hospital. Is that an A? Andrews. St. Andrews Hospital. That's it. Thank you. [shouting] It's $1.28, MALE VOICE: Lady. [muffled voice] Who said that? [slow-motion speaking] [loud honk] All right. Need a list of the donors. So get over to St. Andrews and use your charm. Date of the crash, bloodmobile three, last name on that list is our man. [phone rings] Hello? BEN: Hi, Suzy. It's Ben. Oh, hi, Ben. We're getting a trace on the donor. Is there-- is there anything else you can think of right now? No. Only what I told you. Well, I'll keep on digging. Is there, uh, is there any chance of our getting together for a drink tonight? What? Ben, there's a-- there's a picture. No, a poster. I remember seeing a poster. BEN: What? What kind of poster? Where'd you see it? I've seen it a number of times. A girl smiling. It's a billboard of some kind. Preen-- she advertises for Preen Cosmetics. I keep seeing her all the time. I know it's important. I have to go now. I'll call you back, OK? Hi. Hi. What are you doing home? I forgot some sketches. You were, uh, talking to that guy from the airlines, weren't you? Yes. Why? Because he's helpful. Is that all he's doing? Whoa! Wait! Where are you headed? Aren't you going South? This is bus 28, lady. SUZY: 28? 28 two-way. What's a matter with you? Can't you read? Get me off this bus. Let me off, please. I got to get off this bus. Stop the bus now! BUS DRIVER: Next time why don't you read the signs, all right? Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! TAXI DRIVER: I'm off duty. Taxi! [dramatic music] No! [shrieking] Ah! Hey, lady. Don't be afraid. [tires screeching] You all right, lady? Now we took down everything you told us, Suzy. Sergeant Musky here says that there was nothing in the alley. Now his men kicked up a regular storm searching the place. They came up with zilch, zero. A lot of rubble, but no bodies were found there tonight. It's impossible. I saw her-- she was dead. You don't think I imagined it? Tore my own clothes. Now calm down, Suzy. Take it easy. Look. I was not mugged. Impossible, is it? A young little thing like you? I came as quick as I could. Are you all right? Did he hurt you? You better take care of her, fella. She's much too pretty running around dark alleys by herself. That was that girl in that hamburger ad. You know, the one who pops out with that bun all around her in the Great Lakes? Yeah, that's right. Now, now, it's over. It's all over now. Look, I don't know. I told you, I don't know. Hold it. Wait a minute. Pierce, hold it. I think I hear her now. Yeah, it's her. I'll call you back. What's going on? This is Ben. Ben, this is Jason. Look, where were you? I've been crazy. Something pretty terrible's happened. Yeah. Well it's 10:30. I've been waiting for you for four hours. For crying out loud, the girl is-- Look, do you mind? I'm not talking to you. Suzy, now you could have called me. I've been waiting by the telephone. Take it easy. Look, why don't you get the hell out of here! Nobody is talking to you! Please, Ben. Please. I mean it. Please. Are you sure? Yeah. You know where to get me if you need me. What does that mean? What the hell is going on? Hey, I am talking to you. Now don't walk away from me. Now I want to know what is happening here. Why did you bring him here. You hear me? You're acting like a fool. Well, what am I supposed to do? I mean, you call him everyday. You see him everyday. For all I know, you're probably making it with him everyday. Are you? I won't even answer an asinine question like that. I was nearly killed today. I am not going to be able to take it if you are shouting and breaking things. What do you mean you were nearly killed? Does it matter? You won't believe me either way. What? Is it so complicated that only a genius like that moron can understand? Suzy, look, I can't take much more of this. I really can't. Now half the time you're acting crazy-- Shh. What? He's here. Who is? Who is here? He's in the building. He's come, Jason. Who has? The bald man. Look, Jason. Jason, he's coming closer. What are you doing? You're not going out there, are you? Jason, you can't go out there! Now, look. I'm going to check this out once and for all. Now just lock the door behind me. Please, Jason. No! You can't go out there! Lock the door. Suzy, open up. It's me. Come on, Suzy. Open up. Everything's OK. Open up, Suzy. It's me. Suzy! It's me. Can't you hear my voice. Nothing. Not a damn thing. All you heard was some door blowing in the wind. He was here. He was here, Jason. Look, he wasn't. Now I looked. I looked upstairs, I looked downstairs. I looked everywhere. There was nobody. He was here! You have to believe me. Well, I don't. What are we doing together, Jason? I haven't a clue. I really don't. Let's not make a big deal out of it. I shouted, I'm sorry. The number to Radio Taxis, please. Suzy-- I'm sorry too, Jason. Is there an address or do I just keep driving into the river? Please just drive. I need time to think. You're the boss. Stop at the next phone booth, please. Ben? Suzy, what's the matter? He came to the apartment-- the bald man. He knows where I live. Are you all right? No, I'm terrified. Look, you just stay right where you are and I'll be right over. Well, I'm-- I'm not home. I mean, I took a cab. I'm in a telephone booth. I left Jason. BEN: You left Jason? I'm on 18th and Cedar. BEN: Now look. You get right back in that cab and you come here. You hear me? Yes, Ill come-- [screams] Suzy? Suzy? Suzy, are you there, Suzy? Suzy, answer me. What's happening? Suzy? Hello? Suzy? [phone rings] Suzy, are you all right? Ben, I'm getting stonewalled down here. You get down to the DA's office and you get one, and I'll meet you at the hospital. My name is Kushing. They sent me up here. I'm expecting a Ted Beasly to meet me in, um, Mrs. Winterspoon's office. Oh, I'm sorry. She's gone for the day. Where can I make a phone call from? It's right over there. [screaming] What would you like to do first? Make love or die. [screaming] Then don't speak. Don't speak. When you speak, you'll say stupid, ridiculous things. You're much lovelier saying nothing at all. Nothing. You understand? Good. Good. [whimpering] [phone rings] SECRETARY: Mr. Kushing, I have the hospital manager on the line for you. Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour, but it is urgent that I see your Mrs. Winterspoon. Could you please have her come down to the hospital? [dramatic music] Eat. I wonder if you can take some bad news. Open your mouth. I hope you're not afraid of dying, Suzy. It's not really so terrible. It's not. Looks like it's going to rain. I used to like to play in the rain when I was a kid. I like it. You saw me kill that girl. That slut. It always seems to turn out the same. I knew an airline stewardess once. She was very sexy. And, you know, I treated that girl very nicely. I treated her very nicely. But she was not nice! And so I blew that little girl to pieces. [inaudible]. You see, the thing is, Suzy, I never understood why girls don't like me. I like girls. I like making love very much. I'm a good lover. You'll find out soon enough. Good girl. My name is Steven. I'm a third generation American, and I was wondering-- could you love me? Frightened? Mr. Kushing. Good morning, Mrs. Winterspoon. I hope this is important. I understand you have a court order. Well, my assistant is on his way over with it. May I please have that release, Mr., um-- Boggs. Boggs, yes. Would you please sign this for Mr. Boggs? I have to get an address in the data processing office. When I have the court order in my hand, I will sign the release. You mean you won't sing it until the court order gets here? When I have the court order in my hand, I will sign the release. You're refusing to sign it? When I have the court order in my hand, I will sign the release. Wrong. You are 100% wrong, Mrs. Winterspoon. You will sign it, and you will hand it Mr. Boggs, and he will do it this instance. Because if you don't, Mrs. Winterspoon, I am going to become violent. You're my witness that I signed this under duress. Yes, yes, yes. You signed it under duress. STEVEN: They'll go away soon. They'll just fade away. Sorry I couldn't help you. You're so lovely. Please, what-- Don't speak. Don't speak. I want you to wash yourself nice and clean for me. I think it's nice to be clean, don't you? But don't try to run away. Cause if you do, I'll have to punish you. I'll be back soon. I have to go away. I won't be gone long, so don't get jealous. OK? [printing] SECRETARY: Calling Dr. [inaudible]. Hey, Ted. In here. I think I broke a few hundred speed laws. The DA's office wasn't too pleased with their early morning phone calls either. Take the papers to administration and give them to a very upset lady. And then meet me back here. You tried to get away. I told you not to. You disobeyed me. SECRETARY: Dr. Adams. Calling Dr. Adams. Dr. Adams, please go to emergency. Steven Gerstead, 122 Weather Street. Get on to the police and get them over there. [siren wailing] [tires screech] [loud honk] [gasps] [screaming] I don't know why you're so upset. I told you I killed her. [screams] [siren wailing] Looking for Suzy? Suzy. Here she is. No! Suzy! Ben! Suzy. [grunts] Suzy. SUZY: Ben? It's all right. Everything's all right. Stand back from the door. Stand back. I thought I'd be too late. I thought I'd never see you again. There's no one to help you now, little baby. No one to help you now. [SIRENS WAILING, TIRES SCREECHING] Hey, look up there. Look there. [interposing voices] [police dispatch] Ben! Are you OK? Are you OK? Yes. [music playing]
