Sign for the snowshoe race? Check! What about the frybread contest? Check! Oh! The water balloon contest! I wonder if we'll finally win this year. We'll have to put in some serious practice.

(panting) No problem. I'll get the plane fired up. What happened? Atsaq said Auntie Midge had a fall. Is she okay? Yes, but we're gonna take her to the hospital in Fairbanks just to be safe. ♪ ♪ (engine starts) ♪ ♪ The doctor said Auntie Midge is fine, but she broke her hip and they recommend a hip replacement. She's getting a brand-new hip? You can do that? Yup. Lots of people have them now. It's pretty amazing, right? In a month or so, Auntie Midge will be good as new. (ringing) Hey, Auntie Midge! How are you? Pretty good, considering. I'll be home in ten days-- new hip and all. So you'll be back for the Spring Carnival! Uh... yes... But I won't be able to come. No walking on ice in case I slip. Doctor's orders. Don't worry, Auntie Midge. We'll handle everything for Spring Carnival. Mahsi'choo, Walter! Molly, can you give your dad my bullhorn, Big Red? He's gonna need it. Sure! Feel better, Auntie Midge. (phone chirps) Poor Auntie. Isn't there some way she could come? I wish. (sighs): But I don't think so.

They must help people with this problem all the time! Let's check out their website. (keys clacking) Hey, Tooey! Listen to what the website says. You'll have to speak up. I'm wearing a towel. (both laughing) What did you find? So the website says, "Patients will need mobility assistance using a walker or a wheelchair." "Mobility assistance"? Huh? What's that? Hmm... Sometimes there's a clue on the page about what the words mean. Like this! A walker. It's helping her walk. And a wheelchair helps you move. I bet mobility assistance means helping to move around. Could we get her that walker thingy? Mom said Auntie Midge can't walk on ice till she's all better. And there's gonna be a ton of ice at the carnival. Too bad she can't just dog sled around. Wait a minute! Maybe she could! But she'd have to stand to drive the sled. (sighs) (gasps) What if we build a sled with a chair on it, so she can sit? Listen to this. "Patients need armrests on chairs to help them "sit down safely. TOOEY: "Often, patients need a swivel seat to help them transfer to a vehicle." A dog sled's kind of like a vehicle. But what does swivel mean? Let's watch this. Seems like swivel means turn! I get it. Like my chair. Woo-hoo! I'm swivelin'!

WOMAN: You're welcome. ♪ ♪ (splashing) Ooh, I got this far! I got this far! GIRL: Hey, guys, this is where we're supposed to go. GIRL: This is called a land acknowledgment. The text here simply reads, "This is Dena'ina homeland." The Dena'ina people are the people native to this land. GIRL: We didn't know what the word "acknowledgment" meant, so we had to figure it out. GIRL: Well, the word has "know" in it. To know something means to understand it. We know that Alaska Native people have been living here for hundreds and thousands of years, and still live here today. So it's really important to remember that. And that's what "land acknowledgment" means. Everything we can see here is Dena'ina homeland. There's 1,000 mountains! GIRL: It would be so cool to do an acknowledgment at our school. ♪ ♪ GIRL: We decided to say a land acknowledgment to our school, so everyone can know about the Dena'ina people.

Only first we have to figure out how to spin it into yarn. Oh! Honey, this is wonderful. Do you know how to spin wool into yarn? Not yet. But we can learn to do it together. Oh, man! We're gonna be reading this book the whole holiday. Well, we only really need to read about qiviut. Let's see if there's an index. It's usually in the back. An index? Yes.
