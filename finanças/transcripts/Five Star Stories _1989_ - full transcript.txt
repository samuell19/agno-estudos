The cluster calendar of 2988 Easter, Wester, Southand and North. In these four solar systems of the Joker Star Cluster are found many different nations. Mortar Headd is a powerful battle weapon. A Headd Liner is the pilot of a Mortar Headd. Fatima are the facilitators of war, serving the Mortar Headds. Fatima are a form of artificial life and a female android. Fatima are born as a bridge for Headd Liners to control Mortar Headds. They were especially bred for the purpose. However, blood flows through their veins. They are exact images of normal females. Father! Father? Father! Father! Hello, Lachesis. Can you hear me Doubleipshyon? Sorry, Lachesis. You are the last one to awaken. Will you also curse me like Atropos? Do you still retain your love for that man? If that is still the case, you will suffer forever. It will take time for your face and body to return to normal. Please forgive me for making you like a monster. No, it is what I wanted, Father. Father, what of my sister? Clotho. Lachesis! Dr. Ballanche! Show yourself! Yes, Litra. I shall go, anyway. Lord Amaterasu. Aisha, I shall go to Addler. To see the new Fatima? Yes, exactly. You stay here. What the hell! I've lost control! Oh, no! I'm totally lost. I was almost there. What? Of course, it's that season now. Who'd have thought I'd find a goddess here! What happened to you, miss? Miss? Sorry about that. I didn't think. Sorry, I thought you were a girl. What's your name? Sopp, Ladios Sopp. Sopp, you say? I've heard that name before. Ah, well. I'm Voards Viewlard. I'm a Headd Liner. You are? Yes, that's why I'm headed out to Bastogne. What a coincidence, I'm going there, too. Going to see Fatima, are you? To see what? The android Dr. Ballanche made. He will reveal the Fatimas in five days from now. Is that where you're going, Sir Voards? Yes. That ship is headed there, too. Everyone's so excited. There'll be King CO-LUS III, from Juno. And King Collet from Both. And besides that, Emperor Amaterasu from Delta Belune. It's an extraordinary gathering, eh Sopp? Sounds great. I'll miss you, Sopp. Thanks, you saved my life. I'll be staying at the Lord's place. Come and visit. Sure. You're late, Sopp. You're covered in dust. Same as always. The test failed. Well, you're so stubborn. Whatever. Anyway, why did you call me here? You know Lord Juba? The new governor, isn't he? Originally a merchant. I've only heard bad things. Let's go to the factory. Brings back memories, eh? It's been more than 10 years. Lachesis and Clotho have matured. They're both being taken to Lord Juba. How about Atropos? She matured a year ago. She's gone now. You let her go? Naturally. Juba treats them as his playthings. Lachesis and Clotho, too. He won't say while everyone is there, but he intends to keep them for himself. If they cannot find masters at the preview, the rules say Lord Juba will have them. That's the end of them. Don't worry. Many Headd Liners will be there. They'll be paired off with Headd Liners. Not this time. Their minds are not controlled. What? Their emotions are even in excess of a human. That means... I need you to protect them. I'm dying. This is the last favour I can ask of you. Will you, Sopp? No way. I'm not much good with women. Sopp... Lachesis. Sopp, listen to this. I will become your bride. You will become my master. I can't? That's right. It's been over 10 years, Lachesis. So many people. The castle must be packed. Look! What's that? Look at the size of it! It's Bel Kreel! It's Emperor Amaterasu of Delta Belune. The preview will be fantastic! What? A Mortar Headd meister, you say? Yes, sir. Ladios Sopp by name. Come forward. Well, aren't you a pretty one, eh? I hear you're a meister of the Mortar Headd. Why are you here? So many things here are of interest to me. In your United Rent, Lord Juba. Well, well. You're a smart one. Are you a natural? Yes, I've had no work done on my face nor my body. Hey! Viewlard! Why didn't you tell me? You're the famous Ladios Sopp. Sorry if I managed to offend you. No need to be formal. Just call me Sopp. A meister is far inferior to a Headd Liner. Is that right? Then call me Viewlard. So tell me, you're not wearing a formal suit? I wouldn't be seen dead in one! Thank you. What are you here for, Sopp? Juba's a pervert, you know. Does that mean you are one, too? Thanks for the advice, but don't worry. I will do what I have to do. I will continue as I am. Really? Well, okay. The Emperor Amaterasu! Delta Belune's God of Light! Amaterasu Dis Grand Eaighdas Greens IV! Sorry, Aisha... Fantastic! Look at how beautiful he is! And those four behind him. The Mirage Knights? You know of them? Just rumours. The strongest Headd Liners in the entire star cluster. Like the gods of death! Enough of this. Will you come and see my Mortar Headd? What? Clotho, there's something I must tell you. Was the Mortar Headd in your Carrier? Yes, I managed to do it. This is my Bulunge. Wow, that's fantastic. You know who made it? May I? Go ahead. It's a Kallamity model. It's modified from a basic 2417 model. In Count Cortar's colours. Yes! Well done! Over here! Chase her! What's all the commotion? A Fatima has escaped! Don't harm her! Clotho! A Fatima escaping? Hey, Sopp! Such an impulsive young fellow! Sopp, get in! Listen Clotho, you must escape. It's your only chance. Go to Dr. Morard's in Betoruka. Don't worry about me. I'll stay here for the viewing. You must escape. Find yourself a good master. Lachesis... She's fast, I can't see her. I have a question. Do you know this Fatima? Yes, I do. Okay, leave it to me. A Fatima! Well, isn't she a beauty? She must be a lost Fatima. I bet she's looking for a master. In that case, we'll take care of her. What's that for?! Where are you going, my pretty? I'm trying to find Dr. Morard's place. Oh, Dr. Morard? I know him very well. Why don't we escort you over there? Sopp! I'll go this way. Good. No, don't! Stop fighting, will you? Oh, you're a beauty! We'll be your masters. Won't we? What are you up to? Who in hell are you? It ain't your concern. He's a Headd Liner! So what? Get him! Damn it! Don't move! Clotho! She's just fainted. Thanks for helping me out. Sorry to interfere. Not at all. Thank you. Is her name Clotho? Yes. So she's a runaway? For some reason she escaped from the upcoming preview. It appears she's far too emotional. Master... Who are you? I am CO-LUS, a Knight of Juno, my young Fatima. CO-LUS III? A king? That's right. You were lucky. Sopp! Sopp... I wanted to... ...escape to this gentleman's care. If your majesty wishes. But what of the preview? Sire, she has not been subjected to mind-control. I thought as much. Earlier she used the word ''master.'' As if she was talking to someone else. It's as if she was talking to the CO-LUS' ancestry. My Lord. Will that hidden man please show himself? Sire! I'm Voards Viewlard. Pleased to meet you, sire. I have been sent here by United Rent to scout. So what do we do with this girl? She should really be sent back for the preview. But she doesn't want to go back there. Perhaps it's best if she just disappears. Does your United Rent agree to this? Yes sire. But that's forbidden. I realise that. I see... I shall take her. Good! Look, Mirage Knights! Maybe it's best if you disappeared, Sopp. If it isn't King CO-LUS III. So you found our Fatima. Thanks for saving us the trouble. Please hand her over to us. Just a moment, Sir Pejoit. Despite the earlier trouble with Clotho, she wishes to go with King CO-LUS. What? What's this? That's right. We four witnessed it. But that can't be... I'm afraid we must insist. It may be a rare case, but according to all our traditions the word of three knights is law. Well, yes, of course. But please don't tell anyone. If possible, please stay with her until the preview is over. Of course, otherwise you're in trouble. Well, King CO-LUS, if you'll excuse us. What?! So you left her with him? Yes, sire. Fool! That means they must know my plan! They didn't appear to be working together. How would you know? At least I get my hands on Lachesis. She won't escape. Yes, that's right! What happened to Decors and Torrora? What are my nephews doing? They're useless! I can't? Thinking about Lachesis? No, I'm just star-gazing. Dammit! Thank you all for coming here today. Please take a good look. This is my Mortar Headd, Helmine. Made by the famous Dr. Starm. It's the best in the universe. My nephews, Torrora and Decors. They're aboard Devoncha and Barunsha. Also made by Dr. Starm. He wasn't born a Headd Liner. He's a merchant. He adopted those nephews. That Helmine doesn't require a Headd Liner. How do you know? His Fatima is an Eetoramuru. Really? The non-human looking Fatima, is that what you mean? You know a lot. Naturally. What? They're so clumsy. Is that right? What do you say, everyone? Since we're all here, anyway, can we see a battle of the Mortar Headds? Good idea! Yes, let's! Yes, I think everyone here is aware. The Fatima Clotho now belongs to King CO-LUS. Your highness, can we see how good she is in a Mortar Headd? No! I don't want to. I'm scared of Mortar Headds! Oh my God! What? Did I hear that wrong? King CO-LUS' Fatima is refusing to control a Mortar Headd? That's very strange. Please be so good as to order her, King CO-LUS. You can choose either Devoncha or Barunsha. I'm sorry, I must refuse. Well, well, how strange. Did you all hear that? The mighty King CO-LUS refusing to fight? Have I done something to offend the good king? Sorry, no. That's not the case. You don't wish to show the power of your Fatima. Excuse my rudeness. What? How dare he insult the king! Aren't they just the most magnificent Mortar Headds? Oh, my. The Emperor Amaterasu! It would be a waste... to risk damaging such Mortar Headds. Simply looking at them is sufficient. Thank you for your kind words. To receive praise from the Emperor is such a wonderful thing. That's a relief. He's a great ruler. Hey, Sopp. What's going on here? What a heavy Mortar Headd this is. Are you there, Sopp? Viewlard, I'll show you something interesting. What? Wow! You don't see many around these days. This Eetoramuru is probably a Fatima in natural form. They won't fight over these, will they? Its sole function is to take control of the Mortar Headd. They don't dream. No need to even give them a name. Lachesis! Sopp! Enough! Go away! Sopp has come for me! Lachesis, there are limits to my patience. If you refuse my advances, Dr. Ballanche will be in serious trouble. Do you understand me? Don't run away, my sweet little bird. You're free until the preview ends. Do as you please. Is that what keeps you going? Sopp? Are you thinking about Lachesis? No. I'm not saying you should love Lachesis. You can find someone else worthy of her. Like Clotho did. That's not what Lachesis wants. But perhaps that's the best choice for her. You mean she'd be unhappy with me? That's her decision. I'm leaving. I shall post Mirage Knights for tomorrow's preview. You can show yourself. You knew I was there? You've been following me. Wasn't that the Emperor? Yes. Just who are you? I am Ladios Sopp. So who are you? Me? I am Voards Viewlard. That's fine with me. Let's leave it at that. Listen, Sopp. Why do they say Amaterasu hates Fatimas? Who knows? But why? Why is that? You're so cold. Stop touching me. I hate drunks. Eh, what's that? You're drunk, too. Your face is red. No way! Nah, it's red, red. Bright red! Darling Sopp! Don't! I said stop it! Listen, Sopp. What now? I have many good friends who I can call on. Yeah. Sopp, I made this for you. It smells beautiful, thank you. You shouldn't be so selfish. Lachesis. I made one for you, too. Thank you, Princess. Clotho also made one for me? They like you very much. This is the last time they can be free. Once they emerge from the capsules, they'll be adult Fatima. Why do you say that? I hate the thought! They're just as human as we are. They shouldn't have to die in battle. They're not just tools of war. I shall make a Mortar Headd that doesn't need Fatima. You can become my master. I can't? Of course. I'll do it for you. Great! I have one more favour to ask of you. What is it? You make Mortar Headds, don't you? I want a beautiful golden Mortar Headd that will last for thousands of years. Then I can marry you in front of the Mortar Headd. A golden one? Yes, I shall pray for that while I'm in the capsule. You will be aboard that the Knight of Gold when you come to claim me as your bride. I don't think I can do that, Lachesis. Why do you hesitate? Litra? You can take Lachesis away now. I know. But you're afraid, aren't you? Me? Afraid? No, not afraid of Lachesis. You're afraid of what fate will bring. Afraid of our fate? No, I'm not. Deep down in your heart you know you are. Because you are not human. You know everything. The fate of not just Delta Belune, but of all four solar systems. You have a duty to perform. With Lachesis, not alone. I understand your fears. No, you're wrong! She's wrong. Will the press please gather inside. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to parade the Fatima for you. But first, Sir Voards Viewlard, the official witness, will speak. I am charged with witnessing these proceedings. I am to ensure that all is correct. After interviews, the Fatima will choose which master to serve. In case a Fatima does not choose a master, she will be held over until the next preview. Those with the right to claim a Fatima. will not make protest should she choose someone else as a master. Then let us begin the preview of the Fatima! I present the Fatima! Dr. Ballanche's construct, Lachesis. Well done, Dr. Ballanche! She looks so real. She looks almost human. Sopp... You are running away. Litra. It is true, you are incapable of loving anyone. You're wrong... No, you are proving to be a perfect monster. You enjoy toying with others' souls. Litra... I loved you despite everything. No, wait! Is she alright? Well... Your attention, please. Let us hear this Fatima speak. Choose your master, Lachesis. What? You're saying you do not choose anyone? Well, well, that is indeed bad luck for you all. But you can all try again next time. Do not take offence. Therefore, I shall take charge of this Fatima... until the next scheduled preview. Sopp! Come, Lachesis. Master! That's forbidden! He must be at least a Headd Liner! She needs a dose of mind-control! Arrest them! Sorry I'm late, Lachesis. Let's escape, come on. Yes! Everyone, let them pass! Sister dear! Clotho. You will not pass this point. Begone with you! Hold on tight. My nephews! Sir? Get the Air Dolly. I'll never let them escape! Bring Ballanche here. Sir! They're going to use their biggest ship. Highness. I'll go, too. Get my Mortar Headd. Wait. Should you leave now? What? There is no one in the castle now. It's a perfect chance to show the evil of Juba. King CO-LUS. Aren't you the ruler of this land? Isn't that right, President Mission Rouath? In that case, I shall go inside. My regards to Miss. Megaella. Let's start by arresting those in the palace. Sir! Seems like everyone knows about me. They're my sisters, aren't they? Yeah. I can see the Air Dolly. How far away? Wait. In 10 minutes. 25 seconds. What do you want here? You know exactly what I want. Neither Lachesis nor Clotho have had mind-control. Arrest him! Oh my God! Don't run. I am your opponent. That cannot harm me. It won't work, Sopp. You can't escape from me! Lachesis ran off with Sopp. Is that so? I knew that this would happen. It was fated to happen. I knew that one day it would come to pass. I've lost my one true love. I am sorry, Aisha. Aren't they so foolish? Of all places to escape to. Sopp... It was here, wasn't it? I was in a broken-down transport that crashed here. After much testing. I finally made it this far. That's how I met the president of the land. It's time you made your appearance. What's that? What on earth?! How did it get here? It's a golden... ...golden Mortar Headd. You know how to control it, Lachesis? I do. Be careful, I can't operate it. I understand. It only looks strong. Torrora! What?! My poor Devoncha! This is becoming very interesting. Sopp! The monster! You will use the buster cannon! It's too close, sir. It's the only weapon that can bring him down. Roger. Master, I detect a buster cannon. So what? We have one, too. It's a cut-down version of a buster launcher. And it's hard to aim and very unstable. It may even blow back. Beware of an overload. I understand. Lowering aim. Energy is accelerating, rifling is in motion. I'll handle the timing, you take the shot. Roger that. A hit! A buster cannon! Litra... At last you decided to join Lachesis, the god of light. From today, Lachesis will replace me. Take good care of her. Farewell my wife of days long gone. You have been waiting a long time. Sopp. What is it? No one can stop it. Now, a new age of history dawns. I remember... My name is... Gibih Lachesis Fannatic B Amaterasu Guriess. I wished that this would all come to pass, Father. It is my duty to capture the floating threads on a wheel, and ensure they work for good. If I neglect my duty for but one day, mayhem will ensue. My master will hold the threads of life. But still... still I have to... Yes, my master. And it came to pass that Lachesis was married to Amaterasu, in the cluster calendar of 2988, on the planet Addler in the pentagon constellation. Only they were present for the rite. In the same year, Juba Bardaim was dismissed by the minister for all his evil work. To replace Lord Juba and restore justice. they reappointed Lord Waghtlmar. This was imparted to a gathering of the people by the 14th president Mission Rouath. Also known by the name Voards Viewlard. History began anew. It was to lead the four solar systems to war. The beginning of the saddest of fates. Lachesis, Clotho and Atropos were possessed of great power and their legends have just begun.
