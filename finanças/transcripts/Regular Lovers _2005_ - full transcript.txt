You know, I'm getting married. With Yvan. With Yvan? I thought it was over between you two? We got back together 2 months ago. What a disaster! I'm telling you, he's changed. He won't do anything stupid, he's afraid of losing me. Charl?ne, you're out of your mind. - Has he still got his little goatee? - Oh no, that was horrible! I made him shave it off. He's got smooth skin and hair till here. What? I'm giving him love lessons. I make him do things he's never done before. He's discovering himself with me. And at the same time, I am with him. He's happy and we get on really well. That's incredible. We're renting a one-bedroom flat. - When are you two getting married? - Next year. Enjoy your meal! So what about you? You're not telling me anything. - Are you in love at the moment? - I am. Very much so. Is it real love or you're just having fun? I think this time it's for real. What does he do? - He's a poet. - Meaning? He writes the most beautiful poetry. He's very talented. Is he married? Why married? You're mad, he's 20 years old. Well, that's better. I wouldn't want you to get in trouble. A poet... Since it doesn't pay the bills, I thought he was old, married or shit like that. You're too imaginative, Charl?ne. No, he's a pure creature. You know, I never used to mix love with sex. It's not because you fall in love and shag that you really love someone. I always made the distinction. But this time it's both. Something deep. Admiration... and sex. So, you don't cheat on him? No. No, I don't after all. Even if at times I feel something... But it's a fleeting desire. A very strong drive. But it doesn't count. And also... I adore making love to him. We were hungry, but it was nice. Sometimes we would steal... A box of Camembert, some pat?... It was nice. We had fun. Do you remember my hunger strike? Yes. - No, nothing. - What? No, nothing. I have to go. It's time. - It was really good to see you. - And you. Don't disappear without sending any news. I promise. Will you come to see me in Savigny, with Fran?ois? I will, I promise. Bye. Safe journey. Have a nice day. What is it? Do you want me to dream of you? So, you're madly in love? It does you good. You look well. I'm not joking, it's true. Do you ever see Jean-Christophe? But the problem, the only real problem is to solve the contradiction between the pleasure of wearing bright colours and the necessity of wearing dark colours. Why necessity? Dark colours are better than light ones but less fun. One has to choose between seeing oneself and being seen. For example, you see, with this red, purple, pink, green, I look like a crazy parrot. Whereas dressed in a suit from the Bouquin shop window, in grey velvet... You would look like a Fragonard. Luc. I find you hard and cruel with me. You say hurtful things. I feel that you take it all out on me. And in these moments I prefer to be elsewhere. L?a. I'm telling you, I'm dead already. The splendours of falling in love What is it? Three is the right number. All odd numbers are the right ones. Seven. Nine. Eleven. I think I would get lost. You can also get lost in two. It's disgusting. Why is it disgusting? I guess I got scared. Me too. Two days is a long time. I'm sorry. Will you give me a smile? There, I'm ready. Where are you off to? We're not going to the same place. Aren't you having dinner with us? Crowd is not my cup of tea. Come! Lt'll be our treat. You're very kind but no, thanks. Lend me your scarf. Not a chance. You can borrow my handkerchief. Can you lend it to me? What's wrong? I've been working for ten hours. I'll fix you something to eat. - Is nobody in? - No, nobody. I'm trying to understand you. Are you? I don't need to. I know you. I love you. Oh really? And how do you love me? The way I'll never love anyone else. Are you planning to? - That I don't know. - Are you serious? I am. Will you let me read your father's stories? If they're good we'll try to publish them. I've thought about it. Perhaps one day but... not now. Tilt it a bit. Go back. - Everything okay? - Yes, I found it. It was under the bench. I've got new commissions for statues. I'll need a model for sketches. Would you pose for me? - Naked? - No. I'll pay you. I don't want to be paid. - Why not? - I'm not a model. So you don't want to? I don't know. I have to think about it. It's late. Jean wants me to pose for him. Jean wants me to pose for him. How? Like this. I mean, dressed. Oh yeah. Does he want to go out with you? No. Well, I don't know. Maybe. He just needs a model. You didn't think I would have asked you for permission? - Are you asking me for permission? - I am. Why? You don't need one. You're free. Well no. I love you. Plus I'm sure he'll pay me loads of cash. Is he in love with you? No, I think he's just generous. "A load of cash" isn't much for him. A load of cash for us is nothing for him. I got a letter from my landlady. She wants the room for her daughter. If we have to go to a hotel... We can stay at Antoine's place. I don't want to stay there for the rest of our lives. The rest of our lives may not be that long. I want it to be very long. I want us to be together for a long time. It's unbelievable, the solitude in every man's heart. Are you getting a cramp? No, I'm okay. Just there. - Is it okay like that? - Yes, thank you. You would have your own studio, time to work. I would introduce you to some people. Art dealers, clients. There's no prospects in France. No. This is dross. Here, this is opium. - Shall I read you one of my poems? - If you like. It's called "The ideal bed". Well, I'm reading it then. "The clouds, a few snowy puffs "Are there, before the blue "That you can't imagine them different "They look like angels "In that bed slept the one "whose eyes awaken "To that sky in oblivion" "To that sky... "in oblivion" I'll find her again one day. It's very nice. It's very nice. You scared me. I dreamt that you weren't there. You're crazy. It was a nightmare. I'll always be with you. Whatever happens. You swear? Yes, I swear. Let's go to sleep now. Okay. Police, open up! Just a minute, I can't find the keys! Hide the weed! There, I'm coming! I'm sorry, I didn't have the keys. Good morning, Sir. Police officer Lef?vre. Blanchard, the bailiff. I've got a court order here. For unpaid fines... - Oh yes, the fines. - Since... 1965. Do come in. I'll be right with you. It's an artist's studio. - Did you do these? - No. Mister... A relative? No, I'm a friend of Antoine's. Not bad. Modern but... It is, quite. I'm a bit of a collector too. Of less modern things but... Not bad. There, how much do I owe you? You wouldn't have a pen, Sir? Are you also an artist? No, I'm a student. Nothing wrong with that. No need to be scared. - Here you are. - That's fine. Thank you. - I didn't fill in the name. - I'll do it. Thank you. I'd forgotten about the fines. It's okay. It gives us something to do. - Goodbye, gentlemen. - Goodbye. You forgot your pen. - Just pull here. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. - Same to you. - Do they suspect something? - Of course. Of course they do. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I should have... But it's not that serious. No, of course. You know, the first time, sometimes girls can't do it. The anxiety... I was afraid of my father. Although I really liked that guy. We were both longing for it. It happened with an other while we were still together. You can eat if you like. No, I'm not hungry. Sit down. I'm making soup. - Don't you want to sit at the table? - I'm fine here. Take this. Do you think Antoine loves me? You can tell me. That's a good one! So, you stayed in Normandy? To do something we'd never done before. Spend the weekend in the best hotel without leaving the room... But that costs a month's salary. Laura has a rich husband, she can afford these things. Police! Good evening, gentlemen. Face the wall. Nothing on you? Do you have anything on you? No. No, I've got nothing. - They've got nothing. - Very well. Thank you, gentlemen. - Have a nice evening, gentlemen. - Goodbye. Do you think we're on their black list? It's obvious. Maybe we're not. Man, you're paranoid. You'll see in prison if I am... No, he's right. In the meantime, let's go the other way. Come on. Don't go there. - I said come on! - What? I've got to tell you something. What is it? You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to leave Paris and move to Morocco. - You're not! - I am. I've got a house and mates there. An old Moroccan friend. He can get me work as a trainee at his newspaper. With all that's going on here, it's now or never. So, the code word? A code word? What's that? Well, the code word. Code: We explode. We explode. Explodium. Honey, why are you here? What are we going to do now? Where will we go? Do you remember my brother Fabrice? A friend of his organised a jazz concert in Morocco. As the Moroccans didn't have any money to pay the musicians, they gave them 4 tons of hashish. What? 4 tons of hashish? How do you transport it? - You don't. - And so? You stay there, smoke it all and never come back. Morning is Italian. Night is German. Good hash, the sea, the sun. You won't get bored there, you lucky bastard. There, I'm ready for Morocco. Can a girl lend me a black eye-liner? Here you go. "The Moroccan" by Matisse. I'm ready for Morocco. The suit... I would need something with stripes, something more... - Camille, can I have a look at yours? - Go ahead. How grand you are! He's not well. He's not well. Don't know what's wrong with him. - Is it acid or pure LSD? - I don't know. - Did you give it to him? - I don't know where he got it from. - You didn't give to him? - No! Did you give it to him? Gauthier! Did you give it to him? No, but it's fun. It cracks you up. Gauthier freaked out. He freaked out... How are you going to manage without a studio? I don't know. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Now I'm making some mint tea. Mint tea. Shit! What are you doing? Are you nuts? What is it? Why did you do it? What's wrong? What? Your cash, I'll pay you back. I'll call you at the hospital. Mister Antoine left this for you. Thank you very much. Go. Idiot! Come on, I feel like walking. I'm going to the States. I thought he'd already left. Hasn't he? He has. Then why are you going there? - Do you want to join him? - Yes. Good. What about me? He's beautiful on the inside and the outside. He turns me upside down. I never told him anything. Perhaps because I knew. Asking him to wait for me wouldn't be fair. You've got your life, a man you love. You're having a baby. And I'm just chasing it. I don't know. Remember my hunger strike? I wanted to die then. You gave me a lecture. You spurred me on. Don't do anything stupid. I'll always be there if you need me. I know. Do you think we'll see each other again? Of course, are you crazy? Of course we will. New York isn't all that far. Plus I'll have to come to see your little one. - What time is your flight? - 8:50. I'll take you to the airport. No, I've called a cab. I promised him I wasn't a communist. At the American Embassy they make you sign a form where you swear that you're not a communist or a drug addict. Did you do that? So, the keys... And this? Take it with you. Are you sure you don't want me to come? No, it's okay. Since I moved to Brooklyn. I hardly ever leave this area. I share a studio with a friend. She's a sculptor like me. We support one another and encourage each other. You really need to here. So you don't feel too much like a lonely animal in the jungle. Two boxes of reward coupons. Then... Two squared exercise books, big ones. Then I need a copy of "Fables" by La Fontaine. Let's recap... 25 pens, 40 exercise books, 2 boxes of chalk, 2 erasers, 2 boxes of reward stickers, "Fables" by La Fontaine... I think that's all. Let's have a look. I'm missing... No, nothing. For the bursar's office... What's this doing here? USP... Contributions... That's not it. I must tell you that I am now an anarchist. The others make me sick. I have great news. After a year. I finally got my work permit. It's such a relief... How is it going? Some interesting things are happening. The revolution and stuff... Movements are being formed. I'll tell you everything. After a year. I finally got my work permit. It's such a relief from all points of view. The sleep of the just Oh look, a star! Come, darling. Come. Take this one. Put it down. It's rotten. A comet streaks by with all its speed! Coma? Dead. Fran?ois thought: Will this idiot policeman ever stop talking rubbish? But since Fran?ois may have screwed up himself. He died that morning.
