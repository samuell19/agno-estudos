[bells ringing] [voices whispering] [eerie music] [ominous upbeat music] [lawnmower buzzing] [girl shouts] - Bobby! [birds chirping] [saw whirring] [lawnmower buzzing] [door slamming] You clean up that mower? - Yes sir. - Fill it with gas? - Yes sir. - You do very good work. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Wanna get me a drink? - Get screwed. - Is that an offer? - Janis! Janis? - I didn't do it! - Go inside and tell your brother I want him out here right now! - He's not my brother! - All right! Then go get your step-brother, right now! - My goodness. - [Bobby] Get out! - Is that all there really is? - Get out! - I mean it does get bigger, doesn't it? Sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes. - Let's find out! You wanna find out! - You lay one hand on me boy and my daddy will break you in half! Now get on outside. - Why? - Since when do you ask why? Daddy wants you boy, and that's all the why you need. - Look at that god damn mess! All the way down! God damn cripple could have done better than that! - I'm sorry. - And the front and back is just the same. And over there by the house! - I said I was sorry! I didn't mean to yell. [water splashing] Yes sir. - And while you're at it, you can get that edger out and get to work on the front sidewalk. And when you get through with that I want the whole yard raked. - You said I didn't have to rake til tomorrow! - Don't tell me what I said. I know what I said. - But I'm supposed to go over to Jimmy's house! - You should've thought of that before you loused up this whole god damn yard! Now get on inside and change your clothes! Where you going tonight Bobby? - I don't know. - [Daddy] What the hell does that mean? - How about the movies? - I don't know what's got into you lately. - Bobby's mad at you daddy. - You be quiet. - I think he needs a girlfriend. - I said that's enough! - [Janis] All right! - Now eat your dinner. Both of ya. Stop acting like a couple of kids. If you wanna be mad at me, you go right ahead. You listening to me? - [Bobby] Yes sir. - I don't care if you're mad at the whole world. Look at me when I'm talking to you. You just keep it to yourself you hear? - Bobby keeps everything to himself. - I said shut up! - All right! I'm sorry daddy. I promise not to be rude anymore. I'll try to be more pleasant from now on. What's that brown stuff I found in your room Bobby? - What brown stuff? - You know, the brown stuff in the bag in the closet in your room? I know I ought not to be going through your room, and I really wasn't, I just ran out of some typing paper. - I don't keep typing paper in the closet! - Well you don't have to get mad about it. All I wanted was some paper. And if you'd of been home I certainly would have asked. But it just so happens you weren't and, how did I know you were hiding anything? - What's she talking about Bobby? - Here, I'll go get it. - Stay out of my room! - You don't have to shout. - Sit down Janis. - Well I was only trying to help. - Sit down. Bobby will go get it. - I don't know what she's talking about. - Yes you do. Now go get it and bring it here! Go get it! - Looked like some kind of tobacco to me daddy. [door clanking] - Bobby! Bobby! - You go to hell! - Come back here! - [Bobby] Go to hell! Go to hell! Go to Jesus! H Christ Hell! [slow paced music] - Anyone sitting here? You from around here? What's your problem? What's your problem? Ain't nothing to be ashamed of. - What? - Having a problem. Everybody's got problems. What's your name? - Look dude... - What the hell you doing? Didn't I tell you not to come in here anymore? - I can go anywhere that I want to go. You just can't come in here and do things like that. You can't. I could go anywhere. - Get out of that booth! - That god damn queer. Trying to put the make on you? - Something like that, yeah. - Uh huh, what's your name? Wanna be friends? Where are ya from? God damn. God damn! So, what's your name? [both laughing] [rock music] All hell, and you need a place to crash. What are you gonna do? Sleep on the damn street? - [Bobby] Well I really appreciate it. - Just get the hell inside. The living room's in there, bathroom's over there. You wanna beer? - Sure, but what about the grass? - Well dope makes me thirsty, don't make you thirsty? Well have a beer. Go in and look around, I'll be with you in a minute. Like it? [knife clicking] Now you keep quiet and we're gonna have a real good time. You make any noise, you're gonna get hurt. You got that? Now you be still okay? All you gotta do is just be still. Just be real still okay? All you gotta do is be still. All you gotta do is be still. [phone ringing] - [Male] Hello? - [Male] Hey, how ya doing dude? - [Male] Hey Jake, where ya been man? - [Jake] Oh here and there. You know, in, out. - [Male] Oh yeah? - [Jake] Oh yeah. Say, is Kenny around? - [Male] Yeah, you wanna talk to him? - [Jake] Yeah, ask him if he wants to have a party tonight. - [Male] Well what kind of party? - [Jake] A good as hell party. [engine chugging] [men laughing] [muffled screaming] - [Male] Jake hold his head down! Hold his head down! [men chattering] [Bobby screaming] - Hey, this a sweetheart girl? - [Male] Don't he look cute? - [Jake] Give him a drink of beer. - [Male] Put a little in his hair. Put it in his hair. Come on you little. - [Jake] Give him a drink of beer. - [Male] Hey, loosen him up there, loosen him up. - [Male] God damn it! [men shouting] - [Male] Jake man, hold his head down, hold his head down! - [Male] Bobby. - [Jake] Come on pretty dude here. Hey is this a sweetheart. - [Male] Hey, give him a drink of beer. Put a little in his hair! Put a little in his hair. [Bobby grunting] - [Male] Hey keep that head down. - Get into it man, get into it. - [Male] A cop, keep his head down. [birds chirping] - No! - Sherry! Sherry! - [Male] Hey come on, throw that damn ball! [people shouting] - [Woman] There! - [Male] Hey, over here! - [Male] Got the ball! - [Woman] Throw it! - [Male] Hey over here! - [Male] I need the ball. - [Woman] Over here! Here! - [Male] Hey get the ball. Shot up! - [Woman] Over here! Toss! - [Male] Hey, I need it! Awe! - Sherry! - [Sherry] I said no. You got that? - I can't help it. - Then I'll have to tell Simon won't I? You want me to do that? Then you better start trying to like guys. [loud slapping] [water splashing] [people shouting] - [Woman] Get it! - [Male] Now kill Joshua, come on! Come on! [men screaming] - [Male] Back over here. [male shouting] - [Male] Hey Sherry! We found this kid over by the road! Looks like somebody beat the shit out of him. - So? - [Male] Joshua said to ask you what to do about him. - [Sherry] What does he look like? He's beautiful. - [Male] He's queer. - Get out. - You got no business bringing him in here like this. - I said get out Joshua! - Simon's got rules! - Simon's not here. And while he's gone, I make the rules. - You enforce the rules, you don't make new ones. You don't change them just because you fall in love with his face doesn't mean you can bring him in here. Simon's the only one that can bring new people in and he would never bring him in! - [Sherry] Shut up! - Simon won't have it and neither will the Master. And don't say he was raped 'cause you don't know. Even if he was raped that only makes it worse. Simon don't like victims. And the Master-- - [Sherry] The Master will grant dispensation. - You're insane! - I am in charge. - [Joshua] Simon is. - Simon is gone! I have the power. I have the authority. You can either live with that or you can leave. But if you interfere with my actions, my decisions, I'll bring down the wrath of Satan himself! - You go making sacrifices seeking dispensation for a queer and you'll bring down Satan's wrath all right! You'll unleash all the demons of hell on this place! - Get out! [eerie music] - Our master which weren't in heaven, hallow be thy masters name, kingdom come, thy will be done in heaven as it is on earth. Hear me old lord, master Lucifer. [birds chirping] - I don't understand what's going on around here. - You don't need to. Not right now. All you need to do is get well. There's plenty of time for explanations later. - How many people live out here? - [Woman] 15. - What do you do? - Whatever we want. We have a good time. - [Bobby] You don't work or anything? - Of course not. [door knocking] Come in. - Danny wants the key to the altar room. - Why? - [Male] He doesn't think we have enough powder for the circle. - Tell him to go find Joshua. - [Male] We've looked all over for Joshua. He must've gone somewhere or something, we can't find him anywhere. - Go get some people together, I want him found. I also want to know. Go get your powder. Bring the key back to me immediately. - You sent Simon home master. She knows not what she does. All your followers are loyal save for her Master. They follow her blindly, believing that her course is correct and true. [evil whisperings] Simon is needed Master. [door creaking] [evil whisperings] Your children are faithful Master. You need not incur your wrath. Send Simon home Master. Send Simon home. - Both the head and the carcasses ought to be burned before she's taken to the altar room. - Sherry! - You'd think the poor girl was going to be crucified. - Sherry, Joshua's in the altar room. He's praying. - Oh don't Sherry, please. - I want you to stop screaming! - No. - Stop screaming! Through no fault of your own you have gained a reprieve. One more day. I want her left like that all night. Throw the blood out, it has to be fresh. - Hear me oh lord and Master Lucifer. [Joshua choking] - [Crowd] Satan, Master, Lucifer! Satan, Master, Lucifer! Satan, Master, Lucifer! Satan, Master, Lucifer! Satan, Master, Lucifer! Satan, Master, Lucifer! Satan, Master, Lucifer! Satan, Master, Lucifer! - I wish I didn't hurt. - Why is that? - I can't move my legs. - It'll get better. - I wish it was better right now. - I'll think of something. [crickets chirping] [body thudding] - Good morning. - Good morning. How did you sleep? - Great. - Want some breakfast? [bell ringing] - Good morning. Simon requests your presence at the breakfast table. Oh, at your leisure of course. - Hello Simon. - Good morning. - I didn't expect you back so soon. - Neither did I. - [Sherry] Have a nice trip? - Okay I guess. You have a nice hanging? - Simon, I can explain everything. - Alright. Go ahead. Go ahead. You want some coffee? - No, no sir. - No breakfast at all? Where's your friend? - [Sherry] He's in bed. - He doesn't care to eat breakfast with me? - He'd love to eat breakfast with you. - Ah. You didn't tell him he could come? - He, he can't come. - And why is that? - Joshua was thwarting my authority! - [Simon] And how was that? - My... I'm in love. - For your sake, you'd better hope he is. - Come on! - Dig okay! - [Male] Awe that's too bad! - [Male] Come on, I can't see you dig! Dig it! Hey, come on, I wanna see that shovel! - Dig! - Dig it deeper! - [Male] Let's get stoned huh! - [Male] Come on woman, dig that hole! - [Male] None of that hurts. - [Male] Come on! - [Woman] Come on, bury yourself! - [Male] Come on, you can dig! - This is not of course to say that Sherry's fate has been completely decided. Sherry has leveled certain charges against you which should they prove to be true, might serve as partial justification for some of her actions. The Masters verdicts are harsh. His judgments are final, but he is fair. And in this situation being there no witnesses as such, it essentially being a case of her word against yours. And Sherry being in all together as it is, the only fair way to get to the truth in this situation is to ask you about it. You understand that? - Yes sir. - I have no way in knowing how strong your belief in Master Lucifer is. I would hope for your sake that you have no doubts whatsoever concerning his eternal power and presence. If you do have doubts, nothing I can say now is likely to erase them, but for the record, if you do have doubts, don't bet on them. The charges are not that serious. The worst conviction could bring his banishment from the followers the grace and the protection of the lord of the earth. - I have no doubts. - [Simon] My lord and Master Lucifer. - My lord and Master Lucifer. - [Simon] Thou art my god and my prince. - Thou art my god and my prince. - [Simon] I serve and obey thee. - I serve and obey thee. - [Simon] I worship and adore thee. - I worship and adore thee. - I give thee my life, my body, my soul. - I give thee my life, my body, my soul. - Forever, forever, through eternity forever. - Forever, forever, through eternity forever. - By this oath and in the name and presence of Master Lucifer do you hereby swear that the testimony you shall give in this, the holy court of our prince shall be true to the best of your knowledge? - [Woman] Yes sir. - Have you ever in your life as a follower of Satan entertained in your mind erotic desires homosexual in nature? - No. - Have you ever in your life as a follower of Satan ever made homosexual advances toward any sister follower of Satan? [eerie music] - No. [evil whisperings] - Have you ever in your life-- [woman gasping and moaning] - [Male] Are you enjoying this bitch? - [Woman] Have a nice trip Sherry. [people chattering] [Sherry screaming] - [Male] And then you'll really enjoy it. - [Woman] You're gonna love this trip Sherry. - [Male] Sure, all over you. - [Woman] Is it a little warm in there Sherry? [door clanking] [Sherry crying] - My name is Simon and you are in trouble. - [Male] Sweets for the sweet Sherry. - [Woman] You ought to really enjoy this Sherry. [male chuckling] - [Male] Come on, bring that over here. Wait til this is all over. [Sherry grunting] - The object of course is to afford the answers much leeway as possible. Run the syrup in a straight line directly to the target you automatically determine how and very nearly when the ants will reach their target. [Sherry grunting] With a circle however, you never really know. Place an ant on the edge of a circle, he could go practically everywhere. Around and around or straight for the center. [Sherry screaming] - [Sherry] No! [Sherry crying] - Why? - She was wrong about you. Had she been right, then Joshua would have been wrong. In which case, Joshua's attempts to summon me would have constituted an improper challenge to authority. In which case, the hangings were totally justified. If she hadn't done them then I certainly would have. Undue annoyance. But she was wrong. - [Bobby] She was right! We talked about it last night. She was right I tell you. I'm willing to give Satan my soul right now. [Simon chuckling] - [Simon] He doesn't want it. - Why not? - [Simon] You're weak, you're a loser. Satan wants winners. A winner is someone who gets what he wants. And you never have. Right now you want to get up and out of that bed. You've been wanting to ever since you woke up in this room. But you haven't. And you won't. - I'm hurt. - You're in pain. To be hurt is to be physically incapacitated. You just don't feel good. Your ass is sore. Poor little boy got raped by some queers and he's perfectly willing to forget all about it. You must believe in Jesus. "Meek will inherit the earth "blessed are the poor in spirit." You must be an expert on turning the other cheek. Would you like to trade places with her? [Sherry moaning] [alarm blaring] [body thudding] He's heading into the woods directly northwest of the house. If he gets passed the fence he'll probably be in the swamp. He won't have any idea how to get out. Chances are he'll be afraid to swim. So he'll try to stick to dry land. Make his way out from there. That should put him out around Feldman's Point. - Yes sir! - [Simon] Don't sit and wait for him! Go and get him! And be sure to activate that fence too. [engine screeching] [fence clanking] [men grunting] [fence buzzing] [men groaning] [heavy breathing] [Bobby grunting] [birds chirping] [Bobby groaning] [birds chirping] [Bobby grunting] - Johnny! Johnny! - Hey, you got him? - Over here by the lake! Come on, let's go! Will you come on already god damn it! - [Johnny] I'm coming! - Johnny! - [Johnny] I said I'm coming! - Hurry! - I said I'm coming! - Johnny, I'm in quicksand! - Where? - Over here Johnny, over here! Help me! Help! Help me! Help me! Help me! Please help me! Help me! Help! Help me! Help me! Help! Help! - Grab the belt, come on! - Help! - Grab it, grab on! - Help me! - Don't jerk it god damn it, just hang on! - [Male In Quicksand] Help me! [Johnny screaming] Help please! Help me! [TV guns firing] [door clicking] - Thank goodness, I can finally stop worrying. - Shut that door! I said shut that door! [glass shattering] [body thudding] - Look you two, for god's sake! [Janis screaming] You're crazy. - [Bobby] Go get in bed. [Janis moaning] [gun firing] [male grunting] [saw scratching] [knife clanking] - Morning. Got something for you. - That's, very nice. - Thank you. - What is it supposed to mean? - That Joshua was wrong.
