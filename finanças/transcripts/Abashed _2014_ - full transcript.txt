[MUSIC] [MUSIC]. [SOUND] I'm so excited. >> David: Yeah. Really? >> Speaker 1: I am. Oh, where's the gift? >> David: Keep your panties on. I got it right here. >> Speaker 1: You're squishing it! >> [SOUND] >> David: So what'd you get the complete strangers, anyway? Hey, I know, why don't we give them a month of cable? I mean, we don't have cable anymore, so give it to somebody else. It's a good idea. >> Speaker 1: It's temporary! Hey, I know. How about we have a night where we're not talking about bills or mortgages or kids? >> David: You say that, but the bills keep coming. Foreclosure notices keep coming. >> [SOUND] >> Speaker 1: Something's gonna come through. I got a couple of ideas in my brain here. >> David: Really? >> Speaker 1: Yeah. Thinking of starting a business. >> David: [LAUGH] >> Speaker 1: What? >> David: What kind of business. >> Speaker 1: I don't know just maybe like a child care. >> David: Child care, in my house? >> Speaker 1: Yeah. >> David: Not a chance. >> [MUSIC] >> David: No, as long as it's my house, there won't be any childcare and we don't have the money for you to do it somewhere else. So, you can just kind of forget it. >> [MUSIC] >> Speaker 1: You know, why is it always money with you? >> David: Because we don't have any money, that's why. >> [MUSIC] >> David: You look really nice. >> Speaker 1: Do I? >> David: Yeah. So what do we know about these people, anyway? >> Speaker 1: What do we know? >> David: Mm-hm. >> Speaker 1: They paid their movers. >> Speaker 1: No pizza, no keggers. >> [SOUND] >> David: The guy better like football, that's all I've got to say. >> Speaker 1: You don't like football. >> David: I love football. I played ball. >> Speaker 1: Playing with your balls doesn't count. >> David: Oh, very, very fucking funny. Okay, I played ball. I was really good at it. >> Speaker 1: Right. Good. Okay, you played football. >> David: I did. >> Speaker 1: Uh-huh. All right, just do me a favor tonight. >> David: What? >> Speaker 1: No drinking. >> David: What why? >> Speaker 1: Because! I would like to meet these new people with my husband by my side, not with his head in the toilet. >> David: Okay, fine. But no real housewives of blah, blah, blah bullshit from you. Okay? If they can't take our meat and potatoes world, they can kiss my ass. >> [SOUND] >> Speaker 1: Hi. >> Speaker 3: Hello. >> David: Hi. >> Speaker 3: Welcome to our home. >> David: Thank you. >> Speaker 1: Thank you. >> David: [LAUGH] >> Speaker 3: I'm so glad you were able to make it. I just love to meet our neighbors right away. You know, it's such a shame when neighbors go years without even knowing each other's names. Don't you agree? >> David: Yeah. >> Speaker 3: Sure absolutely. That was a good one. This is my husband Trent. >> Trent: The master, good pilgrim. >> David: It's David actually. >> Trent: Beautiful. Can I get you two something to drink >> David: Yes. >> Speaker 1: No! >> David: No, coke. >> Trent: Cola, these two. >> Speaker 3: [LAUGH] >> [MUSIC] >> Speaker 3: Well, let me show you around. >> Speaker 1: Okay. >> David: Great. >> Speaker 3: We're still getting settled, but I wanted to put up Trent's art. It really feeds him. Being a mortgage broker feeds his mind, but his art really feeds his sole. >> David: So, he's a mortgage broker. >> Speaker 1: Wow. It's so I know isn't it amazing? >> Speaker 3: Trent created this on our wedding night. Didn't you honey? >> Trent: You know, when I was studying with the sacred Hopi tribes of Peru, they taught me that you give your beloved a gift on your wedding night. So I gave her my blood. >> David: You painted this with blood? >> Trent: Well, blood is life! And life is all about the sensual. Am I right? >> David: Sure. [LAUGH] >> Trent: So naturally I painted this piece with the most sensual instrument the Goddess endowed. >> David: You painted this with blood on your dick? >> Speaker 3: So pure isn't it? >> David: Sure. [LAUGH] >> Speaker 5: So just [INAUDIBLE] much ado about nothing, I feel black and white was the only artistic choice he had with that movie. >> Speaker 6: I feel like his other artistic choice was to kill himself before ever making it. >> David: Well, I don't see any ice back here. Look what I do see, a bottle of wine. >> [MUSIC] >> Speaker 1: Okay. One. >> [MUSIC] >> David: Just one. >> Speaker 1: One. >> [MUSIC] >> Speaker 1: That's all I'm looking for. Take the edge off. >> Speaker 1: Cheers. >> David: Cheers. Thanks for bringing me. >> Speaker 1: Okay. I'm going to mix. >> David: I'm going to stay here. >> Speaker 3: [LAUGH] Yes, it's like a weird, like very simple, like almost like [CROSSTALK] >> [MUSIC] [SOUND] >> David: Fuck it. >> [MUSIC] [SOUND] >> Trent: Hey Tony, I think we have another model. >> Speaker 1: Oh. [LAUGH] >> Speaker 1: Oh. >> Speaker 7: Kind of hard to make a decision. Wouldn't you say? >> Speaker 1: Kind of hard to figure out what it is. >> Speaker 7: Well I'm sure that you can tell from the aroma that everything has been soaked in vinegars. Clumsy. >> Speaker 1: [LAUGH] Sort of making my eyes water. [LAUGH] Oh! >> Speaker 7: God, you got beautiful eyes. >> Speaker 1: [LAUGH] Same to you. [LAUGH] >> Speaker 7: Thank you. >> Speaker 1: I don't wanna make it real. [LAUGH] >> Speaker 7: And you don't need to. >> Speaker 1: Oh! [LAUGH] Well, thank you. >> Speaker 7: Here, try this. I think you'll like it. >> Speaker 1: I'm gonna trust you, counselor. >> Speaker 7: Please do. >> Speaker 1: Mm >> Speaker 1: I am so sorry. >> Speaker 7: Oh my god. >> [MUSIC] >> Speaker 3: Yeah. >> [SOUND] [MUSIC] >> David: [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] Let's see. >> [SOUND] >> David: A vegetable chopper. Am I right? [LAUGH] >> Speaker 8: Wow. You have a magical wiener. >> David: That is so true. >> Speaker 8: What else can it do? >> [SOUND] >> Speaker 1: What? >> Speaker 9: Are you okay? >> Speaker 1: Yeah, what am I supposed to starve? It's a housewarming. I'm supposed to feel warm and homey inside, right? >> Speaker 9: Do you need a napkin? >> Speaker 1: Fuck no. Why don't you go eat something you god damn stick. You ever have one of these? Fucking amazing. >> [MUSIC] >> Speaker 1: Nice. >> Speaker 3: Thanks. >> Speaker 1: You really make me comfortable and I don't even really know you. [LAUGH] >> Speaker 3: I think we know each other now. >> Speaker 1: Hey, you know what we should share? >> Speaker 3: Oh, we're sharing? >> Speaker 1: You should share that husband of yours. >> Speaker 3: Oh, Trent? >> Speaker 1: Just long enough so he could teach David. >> Speaker 3: Oh, he's so good! He should come to our Tantra circle. That's what you need to do. >> Speaker 1: Do you have to be naked? >> Speaker 3: Yeah. >> Speaker 1: No, I can't, I got the bad boobs. >> Speaker 3: You don't have bad boobs, uh-uh, let me check them out. Boobs are great! >> Speaker 1: No, I got the bad boobs, they fall on my arm pits. [LAUGH] You got big thin ones. >> David: Oh [LAUGH] >> Speaker 3: Was that your >> [MUSIC] >> Speaker 3: That's like the Duracell bunny. [LAUGH] Bunny. >> Speaker 1: There he is again. Hi. [LAUGH] >> [SOUND] [MUSIC] [SOUND] >> Speaker 1: Where's the clock? >> David: Kids probably took it. >> [SOUND] >> David: Kids, get your mother's clock back to her. >> Speaker 1: Honey. >> David: Shut up. Get up. >> Speaker 1: No, leave me alone. >> David: Get up. >> Speaker 1: What? >> David: What the fuck? >> Speaker 1: And where's your pants? [LAUGH] >> [SOUND] >> Speaker 10: Excuse me, but you really need to leave my house now. >> David: There those are. [LAUGH] I was wondering where those got to. >> Speaker 1: Sorry, we just seem to have really misplaced a lot of our stuff. [LAUGH] We really appreciate you having us over. This was a really great get together, huh? We haven't been to a birthday party like this- Actually it was a housewarming party. Oh. >> [SOUND] >> Speaker 1: Of course it was. Oh I'm sorry, we've seemed to have upset you. >> Speaker 10: I just think it's best if you guys go now. >> [SOUND] >> Speaker 1: No, wait a minute. There seems to be a misunderstanding here. Do we really seem like we're out of sorts here? Like we just woke up in a strange place and we have no idea where we are. But we survived. I mean, we are adventurers and survivors. Right, honey? >> David: Yeah. >> Speaker 1: Right, right right. You know what have you done? Huh? Have you ever woken up in your girdle and you don't know where your fancy pants are? Right no. I'm going to say no. You ever woken up with a strange feeling that you have no idea what happened last night but it's probably pretty bad. Huh? Right, no! No! And little miss perfect, No. But you know what we do because we're couple of slabs, that's right, that's who we are. It's not pretty now but it's the best we've got. >> Speaker 10: It's very enlightening, but now you need to go. My pool man is coming. It needs to be drained. Who does that to someone's pool, anyway? Come on! >> David: Yeah, sorry about that. I thought I had to fart. >> Speaker 10: Ugh. >> Speaker 1: A perfectly natural bodily function. >> Speaker 10: Really? >> Speaker 1: Mm-hm. >> David: So, hey, thanks so much. We had a great time. We should really do it again soon >> [SOUND] >> Speaker 1: Really? [LAUGH] >> David: [LAUGH] >> Speaker 1: Yeah, let's do that again. [LAUGH] [LAUGH] >> David: Oh. Wow. >> [MUSIC] >> David: You were pretty awesome back there. >> Speaker 1: Yeah? >> David: Yeah. >> [MUSIC] >> David: I love you. >> [MUSIC] [SOUND] >> Speaker 1: [LAUGH] She's a bitch! >> David: [LAUGH] It's true! >> Speaker 1: [LAUGH] She's got great tits though. [LAUGH] >> David: Does she really? I hadn't noticed. >> Speaker 1: I felt them on our families. >> David: [LAUGH] I hadn't noticed though. I never notice such things. >> Speaker 1: Oh yes! You're such a good man. >> David: [LAUGH] >> Speaker 1: Let me ask you a question. >> David: Hm. >> Speaker 1: Did you shit in her pool on purpose? >> David: Yeah. [LAUGH] >> Speaker 1: Yay. [LAUGH]
