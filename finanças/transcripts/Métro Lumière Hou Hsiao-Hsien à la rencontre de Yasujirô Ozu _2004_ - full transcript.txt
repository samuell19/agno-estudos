TAIPEI, AUGUST 2004 Our love for Asian films is hard to put into words, because it primarily feeds off of our amazement. Here, in Taiwan, Hou Hsiao Hsien is considered to be a master, who knows how to capture the meandering of his country's history in the present. The film he has just finished shooting is an homage to a Japanese director who died in 1963, Yasujiro Ozu. He is the unchallenged master of sublimated everyday routine. The film Caf? Lumi?re is therefore a place where two artists cross paths, two artists passionate about their time, the older of the two having left this earth. NORTHERN LINE FILMS (PARIS) PRESENTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH WRITTEN BY HOU HSIAO-HSIEN MEETS YASUJIRO OZU The island of Taiwan was a Japanese colony for 50 years, until 1945. Born in China, Hou Hsiao Hsien spent his life in Taiwan, where he shot: "The Puppetmaster", "The Flowers of Shanghai" and "Millennium Mambo". He is an intuitive director, who eludes the codes of Western cinema the way a calligrapher eludes typewriters. The Japanese asked him to direct an homage to Ozu. For the first time, he accepted to work with a studio and to follow the commission process. Of course, it will limit your process. Someone else is assigning the topic. "You have to make a Japanese film." Actually, it's very difficult to cross national borders and shoot the film of a different culture. How many successful films have you seen? There are very few. The reason is very simple. For example, when we look at Asian-themed films made by foreign companies, it's not accurate. When we watch their films about Chinese people, it's not accurate. It's a very big challenge, because they don't know about the Chinese way of life, daily rituals, etc. But I feel this is interesting. It's a challenge; it's pretty interesting. Secondly, I have been to Japan many times. I've heard and seen many things about the Japanese. Regarding the theme of this Yasujiro film, suicide, I have my own thoughts. Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu directed 60 films before he died at the age of 60. We know next to nothing about him. He was the most evasive and the most paradoxical man. And yet his films are strikingly clear and evident. Ozu deals with technological progress and the evolution of morals with which the old generation is faced. But he is always on the side of the moderns. Ozu reaches a form of serenity, and also attempts to describe the questioning and sometimes the harshness of human relations. You know the Yamaokas... - Who? - The family above us on the third floor. Yeah... the insurance salesman. Yes. His wife was in the hospital. Really... why? She's home now. With a cute baby boy. Oh, she had a baby. They say they want to name him Koichi. Just like you. So I told them not to. Koichi is a good name. No, it's not. I don't want the baby to grow up to be like you. We don't need another Koichi. Want some grapes? I bought some today. I'll have some tomorrow. I'm sleepy. Make my bed. Wait a second. I want to eat some. Make your own bed. AN AUTUMN AFTERNOON (1962) About the refrigerator, it's a better deal if you buy it with one payment. You'll get a discount, too. When I was making "All the Youthful Days," the assistant director recommended this film to me. I watched a bit of it at home. Maybe it was because of my age, but I didn't particularly like it. And I fell asleep before the movie finished. So that was it. Until I made "The Time to Live and the Time to Die." After finishing, I went to Paris. During that time, I ran into Mark. He told me that there was a good movie, and that I had to watch it. It's Yasujiro's silent film, called "I Was Born, but..." I watched that film, and I felt it was very good. I WAS BORN, BUT... (1932) I think it's interesting without the sound, because there was no sound to rely on, there was no dialogue to rely on. The image, movement, the sense of movement and people's behavior itself had to convey all meaning. To convey agreement, feeling, etc. You could do a lot. Unfortunately, we soon had sound. To make a film like Yasujiro's Caf? Lumi?re, I wanted to see what Yasujiro's film conveys. What is its background? Yasujiro's early films already had a kind of feeling and taste of life. At that time it was more cheerful and relaxed. They processed all the different tastes that life brought. After being defeated in World War II, the whole country surrendered and brought about changes. He's also been to China and southern Asia. Which helped strengthen and enrich how he processed the meaning and feeling of life in his movies. EQUINOX FLOWER (1958) Ahh, that feels good. You know... What is it? Sometimes I think about... how during the war, when the enemy planes came, we all used to rush into the air-raid shelter. Setsuko was still in the first-grade. Hisako was barely walking. Four of us were sitting in the dark. I thought if we died here, we would all be together. Yeah... that's right. I hated the war. But I miss those days sometimes. How about you? I don't miss it. I hated those days. We didn't have anything. All the lowlifes bossing us around. For me, it was nice. That was the only time when the four of us were so close. Are you complaining because I've been coming home late these days? After World War II, the defeat of Japan, in the process of rebuilding Japan, there were a lot of changes and industrialization. There was a kind of worry. He added this worry to his movies, adding to his feeling towards life, making it thicker. Japan today is completely different. It has a strong economy. It has recovered fully and is back again. However, there is still a problem of family, and this problem is very different than before. The ability of women to involve themselves in society and survive on their own is much different than before. It has changed completely. It is a highly-industrialized, well-established, well-organized social structure. The distance between people in the big cities became more obvious. It's a totally different time from Yasujiro's. AN AUTUMN AFTERNOON (1962) Your brother is very nice to his wife, isn't he? He is quite bossy to us. I guess a man should be nice to his wife. Yes... but I don't like it when a man is too nice, either. Is that right? Sounds complicated. Here comes the train. Looking at them today, Yasujiro's movies are art films. At that time they were very popular. They related to everyday life, and their styles were very special. Hou Hsiao Hsien is often referred to as a movie character himself: A hoodlum who became an internationally-lauded director, a sentimental man, but also a real yakuza who likes dark bars and Cognac. And yet his offices are in a residential and anonymous suburb. The name of his company doesn't even appear on the door. Hou Hsiao Hsien seems to work there in the afternoon, with friends or family. For 31 years, Liao Ching-Song has been following the Taiwanese New Wave. He's also his film editor. Hou Hsiao Hsien asked him to be his producer as well. Those two functions are rarely held by one person, but it allows him to follow Hou Hsiao Hsien's handcrafted filmmaking from A to Z. At that time, Taiwan had three types of movies: For the living room, etc. We went from old-style movies to the new literary movies. The Taiwanese economy took off during the 1980s. At the same time, the format of Taiwanese movies was changing. In order to be effective, one had to restrict and limit. There was little room for making breakthroughs in film. That's why we need artistic movies. Artistic movies have a lower budget, and you can experiment in different ways. Director Hou was trained like this. Obviously, among the new wave of movie directors, Director Hou has the most complete experience. You can see, with this generation of new wave directors, all of them are burdened. Because everyone is educated to love your political party and country. We received traditional education. We grew up with traditional Chinese education. Director Hou has gone from being a commercial director to what he is today. He is following his heart. FOR THE CENTENARY OF OZU YASUJIRO'S BIRTH Before Caf? Lumi?re, I worked with Yasujiro on three movies. We were cooperating at that time; it was very pleasant. We didn't have any problems. This time was a very different experience. Because I actually had to work with their crew. Besides filming, audio recording, and the director's team, everyone else was their crew. They had directing and production groups as well. The division of labor was very detailed. For example, there were specialized crew to take care of location, onsite, finance, etc. They held meetings to discuss every issue, and clarified everything. We were not used to it at all. It was all common sense. We were all in the same business; we were quick to understand. Their division of labor was very detailed. It should not be called "Taiwan movie style," it should be the "Hou Hsiao-Hsien style." He is like a Taoist. The Japanese are like Oyomei Gaku followers. The Japanese follow the Wang Yang Ming (Oyomei) school of thought. The style of Oyomei Gaku is very clear. Taoism is a bit vague. Therefore, during collaboration, both sides needed to adjust to each other. My feeling about Japan came from novels. I read a lot of translations of Japanese novels when I was young, including those of various Japanese authors. Later I read a lot of books about the history of Taiwan and the Taiwanese democratic movement, how Taiwanese people view the Japanese. Under Japanese colonial rule, we have another understanding of Japan. We watched a lot of Japanese movies during our childhood, like the yakuza movies, movies after the Japanese mafia. Although after World War II Japan left Taiwan, Japanese movies were still popular in Taiwan until the establishment of diplomatic relations with China. Japanese movies were then not allowed to be shown in Taiwan. During my childhood, my house was Japanese-styled tatami. I didn't have any special feeling when living there; it was normal to live there. In our language, many words in the Min Nan dialect came from the Japanese language. At a Japanese Karaoke, you could find songs that had Taiwanese versions, so you could follow along and sing. So I was under the influence of Japan subconsciously since I was young. The biggest difference filming this time, filming Caf? Lumi?re, is that my feeling towards Japan changed. In Japan I am considered a popular director, and many people like my movies. I just knew Japanese people involved with moviemaking. You can see the details of the real Japan after careful observation. But it is still different than the Japan you come in touch with. You learn about their strictness, their maturity, and lack of space. Therefore they suffer from a lot of pressure. When the pressure reaches a certain degree, it gets tense in one's personal space. Others are not allowed into this space. One's own area, e.g. One's flat, etc. When I look back, my wedding was... nothing extravagant and rather plain. This is my wife here. It was not love which brought us together. We simply conformed to what our parents had arranged. On the contrary, you two are very fortunate. I cannot help feeling envious. In the years to come, I hope you two will work together. You probably don't have to work any harder, but... I hope you live in harmony and raise a happy family. I also hope you'll always be our shining example and become the envy of all. Thank you. Congratulations. EQUINOX FLOWER (1958) Thank you very much. Don't mention it. It's a special nation. You can't just say it's good or anything. Basically, you need to come to an understanding, and how to get along with it. You need to know why there was a Second World War, what happened, etc. We can't say that Japan's way is wrong. To me, I can learn their precision, carefulness, continuous meetings. We can learn from them. But the question is, more importantly, who is the creator today? Today it's Director Hou. He needs an environment for creation. To Director Hou, Caf? Lumi?re should be a challenge. After filming, I was worried whether the Japanese thought it was Japanese. After watching it, they all said that they had never watched a movie that was more like Japan. But they mentioned something to me. In Japan, it's rare, almost impossible, to have a Japanese director make a movie like this. Here is the actor Kobayashi Nenji in front of the train station. He plays a father waiting for his only daughter Yoko, who is coming back after a long period of absence. He doesn't seem very comfortable. His silence speaks louder than words. His gestures speak louder than his silence. His wife left when the child was three years old. He himself has spent too much time away from home on business trips. With time, the father felt his daughter drifting away. Today, Yoko has contacted her dad and his new wife again. But he doesn't know how to communicate with a young contemporary Japanese woman, who lives her life alone, without answering to anyone. It's been a while... How long can you stay? A couple of days. You... What is it? Don't tell me you are involved with the man. Hey! Father... Why can't you trust me a little more? He's not such a bad person. Anyway, let her think it over. She doesn't have to go to work. I don't care if she quits. You watch her, and don't let her go out. I will never approve of such a thing. No marriage, of course. Do you get it? My pajamas! EQUINOX FLOWER (1958) Hou Hsiao Hsien's cinema is rooted in the cultural relations that still solidly bind Japan to Taiwan. The making of Caf? Lumi?re symbolizes in itself the complex but rich relationship existing between two peoples, beyond geopolitical barriers. Hou Hsiao Hsien chooses a musician to be the incarnation of this relationship. A musician born in Taiwan who made it in Japan in the '30s. Our heroine Yoko embarks on a quest to find Jiang Wen-Ye, just like Hou Hsiao Hsien goes to meet Tokyo. I like the old bookstores like the one in Jimbocho. I use it as a center of activity because it can be used for imaginary sequences. How did you come here? Where do you live? What is your background? Where is a better place for you to stay? Excuse me... My name is Inoue, and I'm a writer. I'd like to ask you some questions. I'm researching a man named Mr. Jiang Wen-Ye. - Mr. Jiang Wen-Ye? - Yes. What kind of...? A composer, Taiwanese. He came here very often. First we set Jiang Wen-Ye's profession. He went to Japan at about 13, during Japan's occupation of Taiwan. That year his mother died. I think his background is a bit similar. Oh, he wrote poems, too. Yes... that's a picture of "Pansy" and "Sweet Pea." I was "Pansy." I had a round funny face. He said I looked like a pansy. That's why he called you Pansy. Yes, he called me, "Pansy, Pansy..." And he said he was slender like a sweet pea. I was calling him, "Pea, Pea..." I see. But the feeling between him and his Japanese wife, and after they have a child, is different in Caf? Lumi?re. I didn't portray it clearly, but the comparison is interesting. He was like from Yasujiro's time. That kind of love, you can feel the difference from the photos. You two were really close. Yes. What can I say... When I tell people these stories, they all sound made-up. I don't think so. But they are all true, really. Not only did it exist, it became more complicated, because the whole viewpoint changed. The viewpoint of a person, the so-called individual. Hou Hsiao Hsien wants to film our present. But how does one work in an unknown language? How to invent a story in a country where one is a foreigner? How to write a script when one wants to capture the truth of the instant? The basis of the plot was from the stories that my Japanese friends told me. Later, I read some about it. But when I needed to shoot a real Tokyo, it was simple; I just found a map. I found a map of Tokyo. A map of of trains, for scenery. I found one that was good, so I wondered how the train actually ran. I took the tramcar from here, then to Yamanote. I became familiar with his area of activity. Why did he appear at this stop and change trains? It becomes very clear to you. I used real Tokyo to set the coordinates. Basically use the simplest method, and draw the coordinates of Tokyo and its real lines. You use a familiar city, such as Taipei, or you only think about movies in your mind. You can transport yourself to any place. You needn't be restricted by logic. But because you are not familiar with Tokyo, you have such logic. But it doesn't matter, and it only tells you why it's here. Why the activity occurs here and why things happened at that time. Therefore, I had a map. I used the map, the simplest one, when I shot the film in Tokyo. We just lived here... the area is the town of Ueda. Our range of movement was from here, then from to Qiu yue Yuan, and then via the central line to Yamanote... This was the line she wanted to take. Look at the tall buildings in the city. The buildings belong to the area next to the pavement. It's impossible to set up equipment in the area of the buildings. Although lots of people are passing by, there were two guards. We waited, and when the actors were ready, we shot and left. When the guard came, we were back at the crosswalk and on the pavement. That's how we shot. It's such an important tramcar in Tokyo, that the Japanese directors didn't dare shoot there. They usually borrow a private tramcar line to shoot, which is easy to borrow, then they shoot and replace it. It's impossible to shoot on the Tokyo JR train. This script is about the story of Tokyo. If I couldn't shoot this, couldn't shoot JR, then it's all over. JR is the most important, the central line and Yamanote line. The two lines are the most important. If both of them couldn't be shot, then it wouldn't be right. If there were no subway or tramcar in Tokyo, that's not Tokyo. If they allowed us to shoot, then many movie companies would apply to shoot there, too. They're afraid of this kind of trouble. And when you want to shoot, it's like this in Japan... if they agreed to let you shoot a train, you can only shoot the appointed stop, and shoot the appointed car. They have a well-organized arrangement for the sake of safety. We shot in the tramcar for about 20 to 30 days. We got into it and shot, and stopped when something happened. We went to work casually dressed. So did Director Hou. Everyone had his own way to cover up. Everyone wore shorts. In order to avoid reflection, we all wore black shirts. It looked like an open secret activity. People could tell that we were not Japanese. The most difficult shot was the tramcar. You need to shoot that tramcar from this one. You need to see that person and this person. We shot 13 times. Almost 13 afternoons. From noon to afternoon. Because we couldn't shoot during rush hour. We went there every day. It was a bit like gambling. We weren't sure whether we could get it. Our photographer, Lee Ping-Bing, he needed to be aware of everything from all sides. He saw very clearly, but it was very complicated. Everyone had to be in sync. Nobody would tell you which car to get on. Everyone needed to cooperate to get on the same one. We had to be synchronized. Otherwise, we had to look for each other. How about changing the name to Tramcar Lumi?re? Sound good? When we edited the movie, everything was the tramcar. Therefore, sometimes we joked and said that the film could be called Tramcar Lumi?re. Please take all your belongings with you when leaving the train. Thank you for traveling with us. Later we hired a caf? to shoot in. The local producer asked who should be the waiter, who should be the master? I said they should. "They should?" We used the spare time of their business. While shooting, we ignored the customers coming in. Customers entered as usual. If they came in, took a look and left, it didn't matter. I would shoot it again, I didn't care. That's how we filmed. It's completely different from the Japanese way of filming. The same for the bookstore. I shot in the same way. I went in, shot for that day, and left. I came in another day, and spent a very short period of time. Because I knew that I couldn't get the shot on the first day. I needed time to get into it. So did the actors and actresses. Whether they could behave like the people there, it's very important. Everything took time. So it should not take long the first time. That was how I approached the filming. I completed it by observation of reality and continuously adjusting. He had a very clear image of what he had to do to complete this film. His creation was not made in a precise manner. Many directors design everything clearly. Every director has his own style. What he wanted was the most natural style. Therefore, I think he is a Taoist. He wants to seek, so we all followed him. It was very funny. A cat was walking, and the director followed it closely. If you looked behind the director, you could see a group of his crew following on tiptoe. What we want is the atmosphere of the scenes. What is it? I'm pregnant. Whose is it? My Taiwanese boyfriend. Boyfriend? You know how often I visit Taiwan. But I won't marry him. In Taiwan, if you want to shoot a dark humor movie... which actor or actress can make it? Especially when the structure is very tight, it's impossible to do it. From the beginning of our making films, we were always overcoming problems. Lack of actors and actresses and equipment, lack of everything, the limitation of shooting a real site, etc., especially the actors. People mention my use of telephoto. There was no other choice. Because you can set up cameras around actors, but what about the non-professional actors? When you look at them from a distance, they won't be nervous and it's easy for them. You can judge and zoom them into the shot. Even professional actors, to me, are non-professional. I will observe you, find your characteristic, and explore it. Or reform and recreate your character. The difference with Ozu is that Ozu is all-knowing. An angle of all aspects. He can shoot a person, his brother, his parents... I mainly follow the characters. It's easier for me to shoot. The form of expression will be different. The form of expression sometimes is indirect. Not like Yasujiro, not that clear. Not very clear also is reflecting modern society, the complexity of people. The actress in the film was born in Tokyo herself, of a Taiwanese father and a Japanese mother. It is Yo Hitoto's first role on the screen. In Japan she writes, composes and performs her own music and enjoys a wide success. Her fans appreciate her poetry and her ironic texts. There was a very large hall. That's where I read that book. I was sure it should be her. Then I went to understand her situation. And according to her situation, I adjusted the character. She had just released her first CD in Taiwan. My casting staff introduced her to me, she said that she was good. Later we listened to her singing, and it's very nice, and she looks nice too. The days my father used to watch over me... are fading away one by one... It was you. I have become more delicate. But I don't know when my wish will come true. I don't care if nothing great happens. But I wouldn't mind if it did happen. She graduated from Qingying University. She majored in Urban Studies, an unusual subject. She is very interested in modern arts and modern architecture. And you can tell that she has her own opinions and is very confident. I felt that she is an independent character, the character that I want. So I decided to use her. Then I had to see which man was suitable for her. When I met Tadanobu, I felt that he was special. He had been an actor in many films. He looks very simple, and a little bit shy. I wanted to find a young proprietor of a bookstore. He looked very much the part. He could sit still and he was very calm. It was a fun process. Like the part where he drew with the computer. His drawing was very abstract and imaginative. It was interesting. I told him that his character is a fan of tramcars, and that he draws the Yamanote tramcar in the movie. After reading the play, he drew the tramcar himself. I saw it and it was very nice. It was used for our shooting. This was how I interacted with actors. He was very nice. If you choose a wrong actress or actor, then you failed. After choosing an actress, you know who will be the counterpart. The counterpart will be good. You should find their keynote. Then design and imagine according to them. You inspect them from the very beginning to the end and adjust. Lead them in. The difficult part is the character. Including the relationship with his parents. Can I get the effect that I want during filming? It's very difficult. I'd be expected to help with the business... They produce umbrellas? They had a factory in Thailand, then moved it to China. Xiao Lin, the character, I hoped that he could say something. I told him, but he didn't say anything. His silence made the character of the mom nervous. Mom was waiting for him to say something and became nervous, which became very interesting. She looked worried. This subtle expression appeared. He's forever saying, "Come to Thailand!" Thailand... Yes. Later he didn't say anything. I thought that was good, too. In fact, he couldn't communicate with her from a certain point of view. It's the generation gap that prevented him from communication, between the previous generation and this generation. He expressed himself in this way, and I think he had his point. It fit Japanese society. I like the shooting site very much, looking at actors and their interactions. In the process of shooting, I set the scene, start looking for them, and then we all get into the scene. I constantly watch and make adjustments. I watch from the sidelines, and make adjustments until I am satisfied. I like a scene when it resembles reality. It's not reality, it's our creation, but the created reality is equal to the reality. I feel this picture and atmosphere will last forever. This is my habit from a long time of making films and overcoming problems. First of all, we need imagination, and then observe according to their conditions. Then give them freedom to complete it, and examine the results. It's difficult to tell, but you keep on making adjustments. After shooting each day I would go back and consider which part should be cut, and what should be added to the film. The original title was Caf? Lady. Caf? Lady. Later it was changed to Caf? Lumi?re. In here are general records of separate scenes. Some details of shooting, a lot inside, including the shooting schedule. This one contains general records of every scene after completion. Completed scenes would be marked "OK." Normally one scene after another. Tokyo, Tokyo, the last stop... EQUINOX FLOWER (1958) - Is this a lucky day? - What? Wonder if it's lucky... there are so many newlyweds. None of the brides is pretty. Did you see the bride on the train to Atami? Yeah, that plump one. She was pretty good. She's today's winner. Are we having some bad weather? There's a warning. Bad things always follow good things. Here they come again. That's no good. She's too skinny. STRONG WIND ADVISORY I saw Yasujiro's script with scene breakdown. The length of time for each scene, according to the schedule, the time of one shot might take only one minute. How much film would be needed, how long the whole movie is, how much total film is needed. It was about 10,000-20,000 feet. Yasujiro worked during the time of movie studios. There were many directors in a big company. There was a notice at the gate, announcing how much film was used to complete a movie for each director, including how well it sold in theaters. It was very difficult to shoot simultaneously at that time. They had less flexibility in the time of movie studios. He used his favorite way, the easiest method. He had a family of actors. For example, he always used Li Zhi Zhong. For a period of time, it's another actress (Yuanjiezi). Sometimes, Li acted as his sister, and sometimes as his daughter. Because for him, these actors were very close to reality, and he thought them convincing. So did you see Fumiko? Yes, she comes home once in a while. She's somehow doing all right. It's not easy, is it? Raising children... After all, the parents always lose. Things don't go as you planned. That's right. We must be getting old. We're talking about our children at the class reunion. Right. "Seasons change while you are dreaming..." EQUINOX FLOWER (1958) Then he arranged the symbols of life on them, to develop his plot. Therefore, he came out with his own fixed style. It's the system of movie studios at that time and under that condition which was difficult, but the most effective way. It's not the same as ours. There are real differences between Hou Hsiao Hsien and Ozu, but they are sources of inspiration. What is left of the model of this homage, then? What do we see of Ozu in your film, Mr. Hou? No, I know what he meant. But I couldn't realize it while shooting. Even though I could realize it when accepting the play and before shooting. The problem is that I couldn't realize it while shooting. You still follow your own habits and your way of shooting. He was very natural, and it's different. If the audience were interested, they can watch this film with one of Yasujiro's films, such as Late Spring. They should have a better understanding of Yasujiro's method. It's like a mirror in front of you. We shot similar themes, but with different methods of shooting. That's how we honor him.
