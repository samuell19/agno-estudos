He wanders from town to town, selling drugs, treating the sick. And in his performances, he tells ordinary people... ...about the lucky rich... ...about scandalous stories about England's peers, .. ... on the privileges of lords, to whom everything is permitted by the right of the strong, .. ...including being surrounded by fools and freaks for fun. These people have been turned into Comprachico freaks. Comprachicos buy children and turn them into little monsters... ... for the amusement of the powerful and sold throughout Europe. King James II Stuart didn't just turn a blind eye to his evil deeds. ... but sometimes even resorted to his services. King William of Orange, unlike his predecessor,.. ... chases the Comprachicos, so they leave England. In Portland Bay, sailing in... ... by throwing an eleven-year-old boy on land. At night, during a storm, they die. Comprachicos with the last prayer turn to God. Before death, they manage to throw a bottle into the sea with recognition... ...for your worst crime. Cold and night make the boy seek refuge. On the road near the dead woman, he finds a one-year-old child. After wrapping it in rags, the boy continues his journey with a burden in his hands. Exhausted, he arrives at a small village,.. ... knocking in vain at home, no one responds to his knock. Only Ursus left his house. He let the baby stay, warmed him, fed him... ... and then began to ask who he was, where he came from. The boy's name was Gwynplaine. Ursus adopted the children. Gwynplaine's face had a terrible laugh.. ... this is the work of the Comprachicos. The girl Ursus called Dea was blind. Sixteen years have passed. Ursus' wagon turned into the Green-box - .. ... a true theater on wheels, in which Ursus himself performs, .. ... the wolf of Homo, Gwynplaine and Dea. I represent our troupe. We are four. Philosopher and doctor, my friend - he's a monster. Once, pirates abandoned him on the shores of the wild ocean. Our mate is a mysterious priestess. I believe her to be the daughter of a king without saying so. She is blind. Are there really few blind people in the world? .. No, we are all blind. The miser is blind, he sees gold, but he does not see wealth. The prodigal is blind; He sees the beginning, but he doesn't see the end. The wise man is blind, he does not see his ignorance. I'm also blind. I talk to you and I don't realize that you are deaf. Master Nickles, you know the man.. ... who started clapping today today? Sure. - Who is it? - Sailor. What's his name? Tom-Jim-Jack What a pity not to be Lord! He would be a famous scoundrel. Tom-Jim-Jack This name does not bode well. Maybe he's from the police? In that case, a wapentake will be here soon. What is it? The man in black, the leader of hundreds. What does that mean? This is a terrible officer, in his hand is an Iron-weapon. What is Iron-weapon? - This is iron object. - What does he do with it? He swears on the object. And that's why it's called Wapentake, Later? With this stick, he touches you, it means "follow me". - And you need to follow him? - Yea. - Where? - I do not know. - He doesn't say where? - No... - But we can ask him. - How? He doesn't tell us anything, and we don't tell him anything. - And if you resist? - We're lost. Why would he come here? We're not doing anything wrong. Maybe he wants to look at you, and if he doesn't like his face... Face. If now I was offered to change my face, I would refuse. Well honey, why scare the lovers? Come to me, there you will not scare anyone. You will make me laugh, I really like it. Gwynplene? Gwynplaine... come here. Why don't we sleep together anymore, like in childhood? You remember, I couldn't sleep without you. No, Dea. This is sad Dea... I will go to Ursus. sleep. Goodnight Well, I'm going to marry them. Don't think too long, it's harmful. And you better, and let the music sound in the silence of your souls. There's only one thing to do, love Dea. It is happy of two happinesses: The first the crowd sees its snout; the second, that Dea doesn't see him. You gained smuggling happiness... That's not bad. You are the servant of fate. You are in a basement where a star is trapped. Please do me a favor and be satisfied. You, as a cheater, have taken possession of happiness. Do you know what it means to be rightfully happy? The lucky one is by right you. The Lord is who before he was born... ... in an unknown past was forced to engage in intrigue, .. ...to enter life through this door. How difficult it was for him to be born. Did you know that in Scotland there is a duke... ... that can jump 30 leagues in a straight line, .. ...without crossing the borders of your goods? Did you know that the lord archbishop... ... annual income of one million French francs? And His Majesty receives annually... 700 thousand pounds, ...not including income from castles, forests, possessions, rents, .. ...properties free from all duties, tithes, quitters, .. ... seizures and fines in excess of one million pounds. Those who aren't happy about it are just taking action. Yea The paradise of the rich is made from the hell of the poor. If I had power, I would help the unfortunate. But unfortunately I can't do anything. You are wrong... You give them oblivion. Making people laugh is giving them oblivion. I felt he was coming. - I'm being called to Bishopsgate. - Why? Doctors, law enforcement officers are part of this commission. They have a duty to control speech,.. ...which are publicly pronounced in all 130 London venues... ... and five parishes in Southwark. You speak in public. Yea By what right? I am a philosopher. This is not a right. I'm also a bouncer. Is different. As a mummer you can speak, but as a philosopher you must be silent. You are insulting religion. You spread outrageous misconceptions. You said that virginity excludes motherhood. No, I said motherhood excludes virginity. In fact, it's the opposite. Accused, your mistakes cannot be counted. You have justified Acteon's baseness. I think a man does not become vile by seeing a woman naked. And you are mistaken. You classified gold-pigment among arsenical products.... .... and said that it would be possible to poison with gold-pigment. The Bible denies this. The Bible denies it, but arsenic affirms it. The answer is not absurd. You spread incredible nonsense. You said that Elien had seen an elephant write sentences. No, most reverend. I just said that Oppien had overheard the hippopotamus discussing a philosophical problem. You stated that it is not true that a plate of beech wood fills itself. I said, in order for him to have such a virtue, he must have been given by the devil. - Was it given to me? - No, for me, Reverend. To nobody! To everyone! All this implies a certain faith in the devil. I am not a believer in the devil. Faith in the devil is the reverse of faith in God. Whoever believes in the sun must also believe in darkness. The devil is God's night. What is night? It's the test of the day. You denied that plants can speak. No way. But for that, they must be under the scaffold. Do you confess that the mandrake is screaming? No, but she sings. You denied that the fourth finger of the left hand would have a cordial virtue. I just said that exhaling to the left was a sign of bad luck. You spoke rashly and insultingly of the phoenix. I simply said that when you wrote that the phoenix brain was a delicate part, but it caused headaches. Plutarch was very bold, since the phoenix never existed. Detestable speech... Phoenix existed. I have nothing against it. You are a big head. I agree. Do you practice medicine? I practice medicine. - In the living? - More than the dead? If a sick person is treated by the lord and dies, the penalty is death. What if he heals? In that case, you will also be executed. It almost didn't change. When there is death, we punish stupidity. When there is a cure, we punish insolence. Thank you for informing me. We don't know all the beauties of the legislation. Keep an eye out sir. Religiously. We know what you do. - We can have him arrested. - I sense that, gentlemen. You cannot deny that you have committed arbitrary actions. My philosophy begs forgiveness. you can go We released it. From now on, I will carefully let people explode. I am the wild sapient, they are the domestic sapient. False science is the excrement of the true;... and is used to the loss of philosophers. To the rescue. To the rescue. To the rescue. Pray... Cry. From the verb comes reason From the light comes the sound Night! Go away! The dawn sings hallati It's necessary to go to heaven, you want to cry, laugh Break the yoke! Abandon, monster, your black shell Oh! Come, love you are soul, i am heart Did you see who got into the carriage with this beautiful duchess? King? Now we have no king. Jupiter? Tom-Jim-Jack Can't you stop that woman from coming here? Master, she is a goddess. She is taller than a goddess. She is a duchess. You can immediately see that you are from our poor land. I should have left you there. But why shouldn't I have my lackey? Because I myself am a lackey among the mighty of this world. Neither you nor I managed to make a career in the church field. Or maybe I will still become a bishop? Meanwhile, my field of activity is this rotten backyard. On occasion, I will give you some snacks,.. ...if you serve well. "What needs to be done, master?" - Listen and be quiet... When will the Duchess of Josiane pass .. ... curves so low you can lick the dust off your shoes. You are nothing in her eyes.. ...if she can see you among the idiots. But she is not a queen. Almost... and even better. Josiana is the sister of our beloved queen. - Sister? - Half sister... She is the illegitimate daughter of James the Second. Having inherited fabulous wealth from Josiane's mother... ... will rightly become a passion when, according to the father's will, .. ... is going to marry David Dirry-Moir. Do you know who he is, this future lord? Master, you are laughing at the poor village vicar,.. ...excommunicated for petty misconduct. Call me "Excellence". Someday I will receive the title by right. So David Dirry-Moir is handsome, the owner of elegant manners,.. ... known among the thugs of the White Shapel under the name of Tom-Jim-Jack. He is an illegitimate son and heir to a huge fortune... ... Lord Clancharlie, - .. ...an unfortunate fool who died in exile due to.. ... that he remained faithful to the oath given to the republic under Cromwell. You can be proud to serve as a minion in a person. ... which is the brightest of duchesses, .. ... came out of the mud and made her a spy. Yes Master. I apologize, Your Excellency. ... I am proud, as you are filled with gratitude... ... to this venerable benefactress. a fool. I hate her. Are you still here, Barkilphedro? Excellent. All the night owls of the court. Lord Dirry-Moir, watching is not forbidden. If there are lucky people in love, I am immensely happy. For me, the greatest pleasure is being next to my idol. I spy on Lord David on Josiana's behalf. I take care of Josiana at the request of Lord David. But as you can see, they have nothing to hide from each other. And tomorrow I will have nothing to please the queen.. ...that I report on her actions. - How did we get here? - The Duchess trusts me completely. I can penetrate her rooms day and night. She gave me the key, me and Lord David. She gave it to him - that's understandable... And you? Me?... So what? Who is Barkilfedro for her... What is he, what is he not. Like one thing. The thing doesn't reason, it doesn't see... it doesn't suffer. And so I suppose the Duchess would be pleased.. ...if I caught her in a man's arms, if, of course, ...she found pleasure in it. But imagine that this woman is a virgin. If she lived in poverty, she would be a slut. It's hard to imagine that Lord David and she,... ...besides, they're engaged. Here it is. I really don't understand anything. After all, in addition to carnal pleasures, there is also a rapture of the soul. Sorry, how did you say? souls? Whose soul? Duchess. Josiana is the personification of the triumphant flesh. Passion hasn't touched her yet, but in dreams she's experienced everything. She is frivolous and unapproachable. And do you want to hate her? .. But you... I love her Love and hate are the same thing. What are you waiting for? I hope to destroy it. Sometimes I wonder if you need a husband like me? You know, we have no choice. Our marriage is inevitable - such is my father's royal will. What a pity. Tom-Jim-Jack, known for all kinds of riffraff,.. ... who plays cards, drinks wine, gets into debt, .. ...scandals - I really like that. If you weren't my husband.. ... I would certainly fall in love with you. Everything imposed on you is repugnant. Pleasure in bed, if not forbidden, is no longer pleasure. Is there anything more vulgar, my friend, than a decent bed? For me, marriage turns love into a saying. However, Lady Josiana, you have a talent... ... turn allowed fruit into forbidden fruit. If I understand correctly, you infinitely postpone our marriage. ...so you keep liking me. Possibly. But you must admit that marriage doesn't suit anyone, it's getting old. In your forty-four years, dear sir, you should not receive more than thirty. You extend that wonderful age, you know it. I support you. Still won't leave us,.. ...so there is no desire to hurry. It is more beautiful to desire an inaccessible woman than to possess her. You have others. With a dream about you. Well, still postpone our wedding. Let's wait when we have a wish. We will continue to love each other, so the minuet is dancing,.. ...taking one step forward and two steps back. We can ask what Barkilphedro thinks about this. I am his shadow, my lord. Don't try to look like a shadowy shadow. And you know, Lord David, I put him in the Admiralty. And to what position, by the grace of God? Jetson's officer. Jetson? Jetsam Lagan officers Flotsam and Jetsamn obey the lord admiral. Everything that floats on the surface has gone to the bottom... ...belongs to the Admiral of England. Except the sturgeons belonging to the king. Suppose... And then? The ocean has created an entire department of marine finds,.. ... composed of 3 crafts .. ... Lagon, Flotsom, and Jetson, for every season, there is an officer.. If any item is placed in the background, it concerns Legon's office,.. ... one struggles - Flotson department, .. ... if the water impels to land - to the Jetson department. There is always something that floats, something that comes to earth. The sea pays tax to England. - And you serve in Jetson's office? - In Jetson's craft. Jetson Craft Chief. When the ship's captain wants to say ashore where he is,.. ...or that he's met a sea monster or that he's drowning... ...he throws a message bottle into the sea. If the waves play to land,.. ...this is the head of the trade, Jetson. Open the Ocean Bottles, Barkilphedro.. ... this post is very tiring. - And how much do you earn for it? - A hundred guineas a year. A trifle? As much as you spend in a minute, we have enough for a year. That is the advantage of the poor, my lord. He has a free apartment in the Admiralty. I'm disappointed in you. In me, master? Yes, I thought that in your face I had a cheap person, .. ... standing under me. You should die of shame, even if I spit in your face. This is beyond my means, Your Grace. I need to send money to Ireland, feed my family. This is wonderful. It would be nice if they demanded more from you,.. ... then you would have to turn to me. I humiliate you for your own good. If you want to reach the location of the powers that are,.. ... learn to crawl from the start. What power is in the worm. I'm proud that even people who love me despise me. When you're in the mud, you're strong. Believe me, whoever is below has important wires in their hands. Small creatures crawl everywhere. This is probably true if you say so. Every day, slowly weighing everything, crawling, you need to step forward.. ... but underground - imperceptibly, secretly. The greatness of my talent is.. ...that I can swallow anything. Take an example from me. After the fall of James II, I was a servant to the Duke of York. I tried to be a church man, but I failed. I found myself between two religions. My soul was thrown from heaven to earth. I fell too low - I became a writer. My Latin poems were praised and I was sleeping among resin barrels... ...under the south bridge. And now, when I have shown myself to be a realist and a republican, .. ... I have a position at court. This position is insignificant, but judicial posts are like drops of oil... ..- they spread out in different directions. Courtiers are family pets that everyone needs. The courtier is a beetle grinder. I already have a hundred guineas in salary One hundred guineas. One hundred guineas. With that money you can ten years... ... feed all the hungry in our village. I think you are thinking today and very melancholy, Lady Josiana. I confess that this is not like you. Probably. I take great pleasure in my dreams,.. ...because I never like boredom. If I were following the advice of my inner voice... ... I would live very differently, in dreams I surrender to vices. Don't force your mind. A future husband can become your confidant. Confident. I know you as an intelligent and honest person.. ...but I can easily suspect you.. ... that you experience diabolical pleasure, .. ...exploring the secret corners of my soul, if only I had it. Well this game amuses me, lord Dirry-Moir Let's talk to the devil. If you only knew how little I feel as a woman, a helpless woman. Your weakest string is feather. I never allow myself so much luxury, ever. I feel only flesh, only flesh... ... that trembles, shudders, blushes, bleeds. The flesh is tough but not firm. The king made me a duchess and Jupiter a nereid. That's why, looking at you, you feel like a heathen. Yes, I'm a virgin, I don't have a lover.. ...but I don't like being chaste. I am virtuous, but far from innocent. I am impeccable, but not plagued by doubts. I reserve the right to appear nude,.. ... I keep talking to the devil. This is the right of the flesh. I could stand naked in front of a satyr and a eunuch. I chose you in hope.. ...that my naked body will be torture for you. You play the part of a rake, which I think you are. Here is my portrait, dear sir. What will the devil say? All these feelings seem completely natural to me. Yes, and believe me, I'm honest with you. Last confession: .. ... I would like to show myself capable of the impossible. Being ugly, what is it? It's doing evil. Gwynplaine only does good. It's beautiful. To see? what do you mean by seeing? I don't see it, but I know. It seems to see hidden. What do you mean? Seeing is something that hides the true. No, Dea, no, my goddess. Hide it since you say it's ugly. Liar! The queen harbored a certain resentment towards her half-sister.. ...because she is very beautiful, very intelligent, .. ... also thinks the Duchess's fiance is handsome.. This is completely unbearable for the queen. Or maybe Josiana isn't looking for the queen's favor,.. ... it's clear she's not the least bit interested. Real envy, on the one hand,.. ... complete indifference and independence on the other. Sooner or later, when the opportunity arises, a crisis will occur. Will this case be presented? Meanwhile, the Queen's heart belongs to the Duchess of Marlborough. She is Sarah Jennings. Well, who's lucky. And if the case does not come by itself, it can be rushed, invented. ... organize. Just have a little mind and a lot of dexterity. Ah, your lordship, queen. Animals are happy, they are not in danger of going to hell. They're already in it. My dear, we talk about hell like two fools. Let's ask Barkilphedro about this. He must know these things. How the devil? Like an animal. Ma'am, he has more spirit than we do. Stay, Barkilphedro. The new queen of Prussia, my distant relation by my husband,.. ...she's not that pretty. But Your Grace must have heard,.. ...that his illegitimate sister, Baroness Drika, is very dear. Sarah, I begged you not to call me "Your Grace." But we are not alone. Barkilphedro, dear, but he's dumb as a fish. - Your Grace, I can retire. - No. Is Drake very rich? Baroness Drika is very beautiful and rich. She is young? Very young Is she as good as the queen? more beautiful. Oh these bastards. Bastards, you mean Drika and Josiana? What is love? ... I am jealous? Or is it hate? Hate, Your Grace, hate. Sarah, you are crazy. What is Josiana, if she has Marlborough. She is beautiful, tall, young, rich, influential, famous,.. ... and I'm ugly, small, old, poor, addicted and obscure. But I have a dangerous weapon - my hate. This is my only asset. Hate is my reward, my nobility. There is no little hate, hate is always huge. And I hate this woman, as the night can hate the rays of the sun. I hate her. The queen hates her. Josiana died. And rightly so, she should blame herself. She tells me "you", gave me alms as a beggar.. ...and I will not take revenge? To see her torment, I myself am ready to suffer. And for me - Barkilphedro, almost a cleric, .. ...to man to command the armies.. ... write tragedy, rule the state, .. ...she gave the chancellery... ... with the importance of uncorking bottles covered in old mucus. So I'm not taking revenge? This arrogant trash got to the point where I was homeless... ...and a piece of bread, she planted me at the end of the table... ...and sheltered me in one of the corners of her attic... ...where I live worse than horses in the stable. And I won't take revenge? You treacherously took advantage of my desperate situation.. ...to render me an insignificant service, to humiliate me. And I won't take revenge? And how much was this help worth? Have you ever deprived yourself of a fraction of your wealth? You did a good deed that cost you nothing. Josiana is as kind as all rich people. They make you feel like they sponsor you.. ... innocently trample everything underfoot, ... which is the most vulnerable and sensitive in you. Despising you, they are courteous to you. Oh, this is illegitimate. Your merit is that you scandalously came into the world,.. ...and millions are paying for this shame. You received lands, castles, reserves, forests, lakes, .. ... and on top of that, she added another luxury item to her abundance - .. ... has done a good deed. Well my dear, let's free your guts.. ...with teeth, we'll rip you to shreds. That's what we need. They are coming. Thanks Thank you, thank you gentlemen. Laughing is a good thing. If you still need me, I'm here for you. So Lord David went to Lady Cavendish,.. ... that he promised to be in the afternoon. Before that, he spent three hours in the company of his sister. So he stayed for some time with the daughter of a pierced man,.. ... whom he accompanied home. Lord David promised that she would visit him... ...and he keeps his promises. Your landlord is aware of this. Despite all this, her landlord's young maid,.. ...that you asked to take the note to Lord David,... ... informed me that there was no sign of fatigue on his face. How he loves me. You know what? Do not. I dreamed that we were animals and that we had wings. - Wings, that means birds. - Animals, that means angels. If you didn't exist, Gwynplaine... And? It is that there would be no good God. How beautiful this morning. Imagine there are all sorts of things I want to say to you. Say. I love you I like you so much You know, at night... ... when we act to the play, the moment my hand touches your forehead .. ... the moment I feel your hair under my fingers,... ... it's a thrill, I have a heavenly joy,... ... and I say to myself:. In this dark world that surrounds me, you are my light, Gwynplaine. In my solitude, you are my only support. Without you, there is no life for me. You are my support...you. You. Stay in your hands. In hand. Walk in your arms. Who is she? Her husband serves in a tavern in a large area. They have two kids and not a penny in their pocket. Take care of her, treat her and send me the bill. Yes, and tell her that her husband will be appointed chaplain. ...and the children go to school. Thank you my lord... She will be very happy. And the next time you meet a young virgin. We'll give her a dowry and a husband. And again we will remove for time a tavern. Do you agree, Lord Buckingham? You got us, Lord David Dirry-Moir. And now for the "Lady Guinea" club. What is it You don't know what the "Lady Guinea" club is... ...only gentlemen are allowed? What do you mean? Lady Josiana, dressed as a man's suit, .. ... just walked towards Southwark. I thought it might interest you. Southwark? Why in Southwark? A strange idea. Ah yes... ...she was lodged in Tadcaster. I wasn't afraid alone... That's risky. She can have a wonderful night, I almost envy her. And you, Barkilphedro, go to your house and go to bed. The rest is nobody's business. This one will never stop laughing. It would be nice to go home. You cannot waste a noble audience in vain. Mass with each other stronger, breasts, quite hot. Give them a gin. First blood. Get the flashers for him. First blood. Helmsgail spilled red wine. Bravo, Helmsgail. Long live Scotland. Great, highlander. A five-minute break. These two people slept in the same bed last night... ...and probably drank from a glass. Boxing is a noble occupation. Do you regret, Lord David, that you cannot be a judge as usual? I have no right to get involved directly... ... in a contest and I don't regret it, on the contrary. Are women allowed in boxing? Not the bourgeois, and the great ladies exist. Illegal coup. He lost a bet. Return my bid. Let my 500 guineas be returned to me, I'm leaving. Stop the fight. Let's continue the fight... ...if I receive... ... right... ...for an illegal scam. I agree Another battle for the honor of the lower city. I bet a thousand to one. Irishman Phelen-ge-Madone won.. ... knocking out Helmsgale, the Scottish tiger. I thought this sight would dispel my boredom. There is only one remedy for boredom. Which one? Gwynplaine? Oh, it's you. I recognized you... Here, take this for you. Be there tomorrow at that time on the London Bridge Road. I will lead you Where? Where are they waiting? You are horrible, I am beautiful. You're a histrionic, I'm a duchess. I am the first, you are the last. I want you. I love you Come. What is it? Anything. Deja, I have no one in the world but you. You're everything to me. What should I do for you? What would you want? Demand anything from me. I do not know I am happy We are happy. You are happy. It's a misdemeanor. I already warned you, try not to see you. Are happy! So, try not to see them. I'm tired of you after all. Dad, why do you have such an angry voice? It's because I don't like them to be too happy. Drink tea, Dea. Careful, Dea, don't get burned. Blow into my cup. How good are you today. I want to tell you a lot. Tell me. I love you I like you so much Be silent, Homo. Be quiet, they say. Wapentake. Whatever happens, be silent until you are asked. "THE MAN WHO LAUGHTERS"
