Should I be spying on you? Well, you should be doing something, God knows. Hanging out here with a bad influence like me. Trooper Joe leave these behind? Yeah. He left a lot of things behind. Little jinx, don't give me a hard time today. See, that's a little kinky. Rupert, don't you have any little friends you can go and play with? You like to spy on people don't you, Rupert? Nobody tells the truth, that's why. Look at my parents. You're the only person in the world I halfway trust. Boy, are you skating on thin ice. Well, genius, why did you quit school? I had problems relating to my peer group. Why does everyone want me to do something, do something, do something? Because there is nothing here somebody as smart as you. You're here. Besides, I'm the manager of this place. What more could I want? I am the manager, aren't I? Heh, sure. For all there is to manage. Mm. Oh, hey! For you. Saint Jude, patron shrine of hopeless causes.

I'm going to my mother's for a couple of hours. There's lasagna, just stick it in the microwave for two minutes. Damn. There's a salad in the fridge. Don't you think it's weird, Pam, to have your son live in a garage? Well, it's not weird for Rupert. What the hell is he doing here anyway? He reads, he works on his things. I went to work when I was 11. I was in Vietnam when I was Rupert's age. And you had hair in your balls when you were 3 years old, He's different from you. He tries to be different to hurt me. You used to have a wild side. Sometimes I feel like I married Jimi Hendrix and he turned into Oliver North. Oliver North is a great American, thank you. There's an opening at the mine. It's above ground, it's not dangerous. You promised me our boys would never work in the coal mine. I'm sorry. You're sorry. Dad, can we go? Right away, son. I don't know, Pam. Vietnam straightened me out. Maybe we'll get lucky and another war will come along. Sorry I'm late. My mother... Don't talk about my mother. Dude, I hated being in that church today. I thought lightning was going to strike any minute, or else the place was going to open up and swallow me straight to hell. You don't have to worry about that. Oh, Jack, you're so sweet. Wanna dance? Yeah. Horizontal dancing. Pam? Pam? Pam. Come on, Pam. Daddy's coming. Daddy's coming. We wake you up? Gonna have to get a crib in here. It's really creepy having her here. She's a good baby. There we go. There we go. The way she looks at me. Oh, did you pee-pee? Did you, pee-pee? Heh, yes, you did. You did. Do you remember when we first came here, huh? And after you went out to pick me flowers only you couldn't find any flowers so you brought me a rock? Here we go. You're daddy's girl, aren't you? Yes, you are. Yes, you are. I talked to my friend Tina in Florida. Her husband got job in construction. You won't have to work in the mine anymore. Cost of living must be pretty high down in Florida. I'll get a job at Busch Gardens. You know, in the Africa section, I could sell those little plastic elephants. I'd have to send money back to Lois. If you bring your kids that's supporting two families. So I'll get two jobs. Shit. Why does everything have to be so fucked up? Hey, come on, don't say the F-word in front of my kid. We do it in front of your kid. That's a joke, Pam. Oh. Jesus. Now, if I divorce Gary I don't get a thing. After 18 years. All comes down to money. I love you. Oh, Jack. Oh, Jack. What?

Well, I remember one of the questions he asked me was, you're sitting on a beach and in the water there are two people drowning. Now one of them has a cure for cancer, and the other is your own son. Which one would you save? How would you answer that question, Rupert? Take your time. The guy with the cure for cancer. Think for a second, will you? Your own flesh and blood. What if I save my son and he grew up and got cancer? You can't just say he's gonna get cancer. You said he was drowning. Well, goddamn it, that's different! Why? The probability of getting cancer must be 10 times greater than the probability of drowning. And if you throw in the probability of two people drowning in the same place at the same time...

Well, we'll ice skate on it in the winter. Most of the time you're in a fantasy world, Rupert. Most of the time, you're stoned. I got my reasons. Name 12. I have known Joe for years from back home and his wife. - Heh, Trooper? - Heh, yeah. Trooper Joe. I had a baby with him, a little girl. Her name is Alexandra. I was stupid, Rupert. I'm poor. So I gave Alexandra to Trooper Joe's wife to raise as their own and I couldn't let her go completely. So they moved up here and, um, then I followed them. Well, let's go see her. You show her to me. Do you wanna know the best? By the time I got here, Trooper Joe had divorced his bitch wife and being the wimp that he is, he gave her custody and then she moved away with my baby. I haven't seen her in almost a year. Call Rupert, heh. I don't know anybody who hasn't screwed themselves up. You're the only one I wanna know. - Rupert? - Shit. You have some company in there, Carla? We are not open to the public. What are you... We didn't come here for ice cream. You never come here for ice cream, do you, Joe? Where's my son? Some trouble over the high school last night. Heard you had something to do with it, Rupert. Must've been one of my many imitators. I'm staying here. - You're coming home. - Who says? The person who feeds and puts clothes on your back. You want my clothes? All right. Carla? I'm just wondering, ugh how long it's been since the last inspection here. Heh, inspected. By the health department. You wouldn't happen to have one of those inspection certificates. It'd be interesting to get an inspector down here for a day. You know, there is no telling what he might find. Carla, you know as well as I do, some people in this community would stand up and cheer to see you put out of business. They'd throw confetti. Rupert, go home. This is stupid. Do you want me to lose my place? I work here. Not anymore, you're not. Please just go home. I hate this job. Starting new job today. We'll be the only two working in the section now until we get that motor fixed. - Eat your lunch. - I'm not hungry. Well, I had trouble eating down here the first week. I got used to it, so will you. Oh, my. Our special tonight is Cajun quiche. Here you go. Okay. I'll be back in a minute to get your order. My birthday I'd have lobster. Yeah, but I want the cheeseburger. - Mom? - It's your birthday. Sit down. Let's order. Rupert, what are you doing here? Christ's sakes, Pam, shut up. I will not shut up. I mean it, honey. You want to end up like me? If I were you I'd tell him to take his goddamn coal mine and shove it up his ass and I'd ride out the hell out of this goddamn miserable little shithole. Jesus Christ. We're ready to order now. Hand me that 15 inch crusher. Carla, I know how to fix everything. What are you talking about? Just hear me out. That's all I ask. This land is worth a lot of money. But my dad is just sitting on it. He won't sell it. Well, suppose someone had to sell it. Suppose someone had to sell it to pay a ransom. What? Suppose we kidnap my father. Kidnap your... Okay, Rupert, even for you, this is one of the most lamebrain thing. Carla, we can do it. I'm alone with him underground all the time. And there's an old exit shaft that comes out right on the spot pretty. I'll sneak him out and we'll keep him here, - tied up of course. - Tied up of course. We can't forget that part of the plan. The only thing I haven't figured out is how do I get him here. Do I knock him out? Do I hypnotize him? Ugh, what's the matter? Carla? Drugs. Huh? We can knock out your dad with some drugs. Two Placidols ought to do it. - Yeah. - No, now, wait a minute. Who is going to pay to get your dad back? - My mother. - Heh. Your mother hates your father. Yeah. But she'd love to sell his land. Now wait a minute. This is no good. You know why? You're planning on doing this while you're both at work together. So if you go to work together, you gotta leave work together, or else you are the prime suspect, buckaroo, right? Wrong. What are you doing? I can make you sound like him too. Heh, oh, no, I am not even stoned and you're beginning to make sense to me. Look, my mom, she works hard too, right? So why is he in charge of everything? Because he's the king? I'm calling a revolution. Are you with you or against me? Do you know what I could do for my kid with that kind of money? Well, I'd also buy myself one incredible red dress. And I want you to write poetry. Can you write poetry, Rupert? I think that I shall never see a poem as lovely as you mean. Pie as tasty as your thigh, - or smoke pot as free... - Okay, okay, heh. Will you help me, Carla? Will you come away with me? The question is can a poor ex-hippie be saved? I'll save you. I love you. Rupert, you really are very sweet. Will you help me? No. You will? No. - You will? - No. - You will, heh. - No. - Mwah, You will. - No. Rupert. Rupert, heh. I don't wanna be a tadpole. I wanna be a dolphin. I want to be a very rich, ugh, dolphin.

Pam, Gary's in trouble. This seems extremely private to me. Ma, what the hell are you talking about? This isn't real. Come on, who'd kidnap Gary Marshetta? This is his revenge. It was little war games, we're the communist and he's the Green Berets. I knew he was gonna do something. Not like Gary know how to do a payback. So this is it. He wants to get me all worried and feeling sorry for him and meanwhile he's in a bar somewhere having a beer and a good laugh. Do you really think so? I know so. I'm not doing a thing. He'll come home when he's good and ready. Ma, if you had the chance, if you had some money, you'd run away with him, wouldn't you? Yes, Rupert. Yes, I would. I kidnapped dad. You're nuts. - Pam, he's getting nuts. - What? I kidnapped dad. He's not too far away and, uh, he's kind of tied up. See, I figured the lawyers will let you sell his land if you had a good reason. This is a pretty good reason, don't you think? You are nuts. Rupert Anthony Marshetta. Then after you gave the money to his kidnappers, I mean me, I'd give half of it back to you. So you could take off with him. Is dad all right? Yeah, he's fine. Pam. This is what we need, isn't it? You're not thinking of going along with this, are you? Let me think. Yeah, let her think. I'd only want a piece of it. I mean I'd give half of it to Gary just to be fair, all right? I'll go along with that. I vote no. You don't vote in my revolution. Ma, viva the revolution. Why the hell not? All right. All right. Yeah! Any decision? And under the circumstances, I'd do anything I could to help you sell that land, Mrs. Marshetta. Hell lot by a piece of it myself if it would help your husband. I mean, I'm just a housewife. I don't have anything my own. I'm sorry. It's just been hard. Of course. Would you like some white wine? No, thank you. It's a horrible situation. But there is a problem and I'm embarrassed to be the one to tell you. Oh, please don't be. There's no land to sell. Your husband sold that piece of property last week. What? Sold it for cash, didn't want a cheque, didn't want your bank to know. Hard cold cash. He sold the goddamn land. You're hungry. Wake up. Oh. Hey. Hey, Mr. Marshetta, are you all right? You got the keys of this cuffs, huh? You better. If you want to keep breathing, you better. All right. Now roll here. Come here and unlock these chains, Mr. Trick or Treat or I'll twist your friend's head right off his neck. Rupert. Hello, dad. Rupert, all right. Hey, come on, get me out of these chains, boy. - Come on, son. - Let her go, dad. Let her go! Hey, come on, let's get out of here. It's you. You bitch! She kidnapped me, Rupert. Shoot her. She imprisoned me. She abducted and imprisoned me. She squirted Cheez-Whiz in my face. Dad, you don't understand. Come on, Rupert, let's get out of here. - Wait outside. - No, now, come on, it's over. Wait outside! Christ, she kidnapped your old man. You can't just let her walk out of here like that. I did it. Rupert, make sense. I planned it. I did it. You did? I did. What for? For the goddamn money that's what for. Get that gun out of my face. What the hell you know about guns anyway? You sold the land. Yeah. They'll be here with the bulldozers next week. All the trees will be gone. Where's the money? Your mother? She thought you were playing a joke on her to scare her. Scare back in love with me. Do you think that's possible? Where is the money? Would you kill me for? Sometimes I felt like I could kill you. There's something... There's something else. You know, If I had just put that money in the bank and share it with all of you, your mother would be gone right now. She'd left. I figured... All this way... I'd keep her. Keep her prisoner. No. Oh, what else do you call it when you keep someone against their will? Prisoner? Hey, you're pretty smart, kid. Dad, please, I don't want to hurt you. Tell me where the money is. He sold the land out from under us. Good. It's over. Come on, let's go. You want to give up now when we're so close. Close to what? Jail? You're standing there with a goddamn shotgun in your hand. I cannot let him win, not this time. Rupert, I made one mistake in my life and I am still paying for it. This feels just like the same thing. Now come on, we'll get out of this. Come on. Don't do this, Rupert. Shit. Told you I hate this job. Well, guess your bail. I'll give you a hint, it's in the five-figure range. If it was five bucks and a smile, I couldn't make it. What about Rupert? We still can't find him or his dad. Carla, if you know where he is, I can get to him, I can try to help him. He's young. He just made a mistake. Well, everybody makes mistakes. Even you? Yeah, even me. Carla, sometimes I can act like such a... A butthead? Yeah. Joe. State boys wanna search the Harmar Mine. They think he might be hiding in there with his daddy. Okay. Right there. Hey, wait a minute. There's back entrance to that mine. "I was sent from the heaven into my mother's arms, sent by God to Earth with all the babies' charms. But that took a different route. No shelter have I found. Got a 30/30 in my hand, heaven sent and a hell bound. Like that? Mm-hm. It's a poem. Hmm. Dad, please, where is the money? Where is it? Just tell me where it is. Let me have one of them Slim Jims. Excuse me. I have to take a leak. Now the company won't let us take a leak. Weird. Yeah, I guess, they want us to shit our own time. Why don't they just take the junks out instead of keeping them locked up? Seems kind of... The Port 'O' Jonny. You hid it in the Port 'O' Jonny. Who would hide money in a Port 'O' Jonny? Let's find out. You know, the damn thing is nearly indestructible. You know, come a nuclear disaster. There's gonna be two things left, cockroaches and this goddamn portable shit. Now, be careful the flame doesn't get too high, because if it does, you have methane. You better get out of there just as fast as you can. All right, now, let's go. Watch your step, Carla. Rupert! You know, if there's any gas in here that little charge just might set her off. We'll have to take that chance. Roof might come down. Get a rip rolling all the way out of here. I angled the charges like you do into a cold phase so the explosion makes a V blowing out, not up, right? Heh, right. Rupert. I love you. What's down here? Little Genius, where are you? Did you hear? Dogs. Joe, I don't know... Joe? Yeah, this is great, Carla. Rupert! Rupert! Carla! Little Genius! Carla! Rupert, I'm over here! Come on, you've got to come out with us! Where are you? I'm in this tunnel and it's kind of quiet... There's rocks and... I'm in a tunnel! I found the money! Rupert, the cops are after you. We've got to get out of here. Carla! Follow my voice! I am! I think. Carla! Stop! Stop right where you are! Come on. Come on. Where'd he go? There he is. Hey, hotshot. No, wait, hey, hang on! - Help me, dad. - Son. You're under arrest. - What in that lamp? - Methane. We've got about 60 seconds before this whole place blown to sky high. Carla! Carla! Get out of here. Move out. - Dad, let me go. - Can't, son. Carla! This way. Get on. Please. Carla! No. Carla! 10-1, Unit 4, 10-1, Unit 4, there are two persons still missing. Request you standby, over. It's easier down the station house - to keep an eye on... - No jail. I'll keep him home. Don't worry, I'll keep him. It seems you'll get along faster without that luggage. Let me help you there. I think there's somebody you know. You're not dead? Well, they are still looking for me. Which when you think about it, puts me in a very interesting situation. Little Genius always wanted to run away. Well, now I'm ready. Go to Philadelphia to the east New York to the north, California to the west. Rio de Janeiro? Yeah, that's south. How about Sacramento? Sacramento, California? That's where my little girl is. Joe, cleaned out the savings account, he thinks maybe we can talk some sense to the former Mrs. Trooper. We could be a family, Rupert. I think I'd rather be handcuffed to a refrigerator. Rupert. Look, I'm sorry. I love Joe. I do. I love you too. It's just not same. I'm sorry. I'm sure you've had your fill of this sort of thing. I think you should see your little girl. Sacramento and Joe, but I... Not for me. Can I at least give you a ride? Tell you what I'm gonna do. When I get to Sacramento, I'm gonna put my name and number in the phonebook, okay? Okay? Carla! I hope someday I meet your daughter. Someday it would be my privilege to introduce her to you. Hey! Got a souvenir. Bye! Hey. Where you going? South America. Maybe just Pittsburg. I can't decide. Where are your friends? I lost them. I'm on my own. Like you. Hey, don't you need a passport or something to go to South America? Depends on how you go, I guess. I don't think you need one to go to Pittsburg. You want a ride? I suppose I could do that. So what do you do, anyway? I don't do anything anymore. Well, what you used to do?
