Now that the world is in chaos and confusion rules our minds: Love for fellow man, teach the world we must. For if every heart is filled with love, peace and happiness are within our grasp. All are created equal, all are blessed by God. We should walk side by side, all willing to lend a hand. If every man learns to love, whatever our color or tongue: We will be as one! Je t'aime. Ti amo, I love you... I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you: however you ca“ it, the world should learn it: Love is the answer. One work}, one song, one cry! Love! What a crap! Alright, your hand is not stiffened. Hello! Merry Christmas. Beer'? How much is a bottle? - Still cheap. For the night is still young. Now if you hear an owl hoots, then the price doubles up. Don't worry. Because you're early, I'll give you a ten percent discount! 'Nah... How old are you? Eighteen. - Are you sure? - Yes! Okay, I believe you. Eighteen percent discount! Thanks. Later, I guess... Suit yourself. You like a companion? A companion? Your first time? Your first time? I'm Belinda. I will not ask for your name. I remember faces, but I suck at names. Would you believe me if I tell you my name? Do I need to believe you? What matters is that you are true to yourself. No pretentions. Horny, if horny. Itchy, if itchy. With my two hands, I shall welcome you. Scratch it for you! Is it usually like this? All seats are empty. It's Sunday. The queer folks heard masses. Seeking penance from a week-long debauchery. You like him? Who is he? Who or what? His name is Lawrence, but would you believe it? Lawrence... I'll leave you now. But I'll be around. Thank you. Allow me, sir. I am Lawrence. All by yourself? Yes. You're so cute! Care for a bottle? Maybe later. Just one, please. Order a drink for me. No, please. Make the announcement for Marky! Damn it, Aries! Don't you say the traffic is bad. Not on a Sunday! I'll whack your balls! Sorry. I had to scrounge for a ride. It's a lean season, you know. Cock-sucker shit! I'll make it up on the dance floor. Get a move on! Belinda's breathing fire by now! Hack it good. The cashier's still zero. Dog-tired, aren't you? - Did you jerk off? - Asshole! He hit on a fag! Look at his wobbly legs! You're up! Fucker shit, I'm next! The dragon is coming out! Hey faggot! Look at me! I am a bitch! Up here my tits are growing... Squeeze me! Is this possible? Don't say I'm not a woman. Look at me, I'm a bitch. Stanley, standby! Bro', I'm done. It's still flaccid. What? Watch a porn! Done that. It won't budge. You pinch it for me. His dick's still dozed off! What's with the wilted veggie? I told you not eat a bad cum! Aries should go first. Sure! Here, take your pick. Pussy or penis?! Slap it a little. Here's a rubber band. Tie it at the base. You look cute! Thanks. Marimar, our guest is so cute! I noticed that. He even spend a hundred! If he calls you, ask for his name! Promise? - I will. Oh, a cute hard-on! All set? Hard and rock solid! What a prick! Too bad I have a crush on him. One day he's mine. When I see you dancing, every move you make, takes my breath away. In every moment, I can see how poor you are, as if it were my burden. If only I could let you know, how much I 'm longing for your love. That's a“ I'm asking for. If you give me your love, I will give you my life. The fear will be taken away from you, because I will be yours. If there's room for me in you heart, you will no longer suffer. At my side love and happiness will be your's, if only you'll love me too. When I see you dancing, you take my breath away. In every moment, I can see how poor you are, as if it were my burden. I ask the wind, if you will be mine. Just a stogie kiss would be enough. If you give me your love, I will give you my life. The fear will be taken away, because I will be yours. If there's room for me in your heart, you will no longer suffer. At my side, love and happiness will be yours, if only you love me too. If only you Jove me too. Horny now? Who is he? His name is Aries. Eighteen years old. Complete set of teeth. Seven and a half-inch dick. Bigger than usual. How much? Bar fine, one thousand. Short time, one thousand. All night long, three thousand. Motel fee, overnight, one-five. A total of five-five. Just a moment! The fish you ordered arrived. And the drift-wood. I paid it with your allowance. Two-five for the fish, one-five for the sand and drift wood. A total of four thousand. I no longer owe you money! What? Still asleep? You are such a handsome devil. More so if you've finally taken a bath! I really don't get this aquarium thing. You're like your father- one is never enough. Give me your blanket! - No, I'll do it! Need it be this many? You already collected stuff since you were young. Whatever catches your fancy, you buy it. Not once, or 'mice... over and over again. Take these for example, They're just on the shelf. For crying out loud! If all you need are decorations, you could've asked for figurines instead. Look... you never heeded my advice. Even if I hold your allowance, you still find ways to buy things. I don't see the logic in keeping these aquariums. Are you putting up a pet Shop? You don't go out as much. Get some sunlight! Since Christmas vacation started, you do nothing but stay here. Wait, are you doing drugs? Don't you ever go astray, like the Governor's boy. What his name? Aries. Aries? The one that got kicked out of school for smoking pot? Anyway, because Aries is such a pothead, he gets expelled time and again. Now because the father is prominent, he gets reinstated. What's that got to do with my life? "I'm just saying it! You talk like your father! What has he got to do with my life? Our life? What kind of question is that? Of course he matters! He's your father! Part time only. For me and you. Life's like that! I can't do anything about it. You should've never agreed on this set-up. He only comes home when he wants. We are his second family and a second priority. You should try to understand... That he collects wives? I collect comic books and you refuse to understand! What's that got to do with me? I'm just saying it. Soon you'll get a wife. Then you'll understand my predicament. If that ever happens, fire and brimstone will fall upon us. You are probably still on your own. Dad! Only women are cleaning men's underwear! Dad! That's were you live. Did you move again? I've been looking for you the whole afternoon. I live there! Since when? Since two months. Your mother wanted to come. She had no money for the bus. And someone has to look after your siblings. How are they? Okay. Also Toteng. He's still working for your aunt. But next year they will sent him to school. Alwin is still delivering onions to Catarman. He is hardly at home. And how about Weng, Dad? Nothing new. She is still with your godfather. Will she be coming home? Let your sister do, whatever she wants. You know, how resentful she can be. She's better over there than with us. Where she only hangs around at the beach. She has an affair with a council-man. Some coffee, Dad? Thanks. Put the vegetables away. It looks totally fresh, Yes, it is your favourite. We are only taking care for your three siblings. Poklong is always looking for you. And asks when you will be coming home. Wait a moment. I'll get us some food. No need, son. I can't stay any longer. Just a small something. The noodles are really good. No, I have to go to Balintawak at five. We have to go Montalban later. I just wanted to see my son. Happy New Year. No, don't. No argues! That's really for you. It's not much, but... it is for you. Thank you, Dad. Hey! One-five, I'll take everything. Three thousand is rock bottom already! You never allowed me to borrow these. Now you're selling it? That's why it's three thousand. Honeymoon. Outside. It's raining. The rain sprinkles the trees. The wind whispers at the ears of the leafs. As you are sitting on me, your eye-lashes are shut, are open. Sweat is shimmering on your lips. Your faces are glooming. Your fingers are disappearing in your hair that is wet from rain. Thanks heavens, after the ravenous croc, comes the fluttering butterfly! I've got the money. Bar fine, two thousand. Wait, I thought the barf toe is one thousand? That was last week. I'm sorry. They're extorting money from us... The big guy? He's a mere collector, the mayor's thug. Come inside. You're so early! We're still butt ugly! Want some fireworks? You're just a firecracker. Here's dynamite! I'm Aries. I know. Bar fine, two thousand. All night long, three thousand. Motel fee, overnight, one-five. A total of six-five! Go forth and be many! Hello, Happy New Year! Are you coming already? I've cooked your favorite dish, Chicken Afritada. What is it this time? You said the same thing the last All Saints Day! Then Christmas! You said you're gonna be here for the New Year! Whatever you say. “May New Year... - Happy New Year, Ma. - Happy New Year... Oh, we have a visitor. It's Aries, my classmate. - He's spending the New Year with us. - Good evening, ma' am. Oh, you better eat now. We have Chicken Afritada. Eat as long as it is hot. Maybe later. First we go upstairs. Come down in a while. It's almost midnight. We'll soon have fireworks. Come in. Your room is really special. So many fish tanks. You probably don't eat fish. I even want more. I think your mother disapproves that I came. No, it's not you. Probably Dad is not coming again. Take a seat. He's working? He's got another family. Maybe his wife didn't allow him. I guess I'm just like your father. Hitting two gay bars in one night. Sometimes three. You can do that? Sure. I'm all over the night spots. Where are you dancing? Everywhere... In Cubao, Passai, Timog. At contests for gay dancers. Contests? And do you win sometimes? Sure. Sometimes I also lose, but on the stage I always give my best. Where's the bathroom? It's over there. Even in the comfort room, I see an aquarium. Yes. I have one in the dining room too! - Wanna see it? - No, than ks. How do you call these? The small ones are called shellies. Down there are the shells. They live there. Like these, the striped ones. With the black stripes. The other ones have white stripes. They are from the same breed. Don't put your hand in! These ones are really nasty. They once bite my hand. Great. Everyone has its own area. Indeed. These are really colorful. They are from the amazon. I hold several species together. The big ones are discus. The red ones are characins. And these are white cloud mountain minnows. Are they expensive? Yes. I even sold my comic-book collection. This one looks bare. No sand at all. That's the breeding tank. They're a couple. The fingerlings you see are the offsprings. Both parents produce bodily mucous. It's like milk. The little ones feed on it. This one looks murky already. You probably don't clean it? It has to be that way. It's called biotope. I set it up to resemble the natural habitat. The water acidity. The temperature. The plants. The color of the sand. The species that live together. These are satanoperca daemon. From the murky waters of South America. The darker the water, the better. It is good for their survival. What if you mix fishes from two different habitats? One species could die. Or if it survives, it will not be happy. Some thrive on clean waters. Some feed on the dark corners. Son, it's time to eat! Midnight has come! Take some more chicken. It is a special recipe. My husband's favourite meal. More potatoes. It tastes better with sauce. Just feel like home. What's with you? Do you have chicken? Yes. Eat up, guys. Wait, have you not wearing a white shirt? Now it's pink! Mommy, you're just drunk! Happy New Year. Another new year. In the past, we celebrate the good times! Now, we celebrate because we have survived the hard times. Really, life was better during Marcos. Mum... Look at these fruits. We usually have heaps of grapes. Now it's only a handful. What did we gain from the Edsa Revolution? Nothing but a revolution of the stomach! Marcos is not corrupt. It's the people around him! That I cannot accept. That's the truth! Life was definitely better. We never heard of officials getting involved in corruption! There was no press freedom at all. So how do you know about this? What do you know? You were born during Aquino. What I know is that we are poor, because Marcos duped us big time! He made a shithole so deep, we're still buried from neck down! That's why the people are starving. They do things to survive. Our policemen are extortionists! Our women are prostitutes! Our men are macho dancers! Fine! Tell that to the congressmen! There's poverty because of womanizing weasels like them! Like your father! They should form a group! Yes, a group of Marcos loyalists! They're loyal because they believe in his leadership! They remain loyal because they're all involved in corruption! Same feather, fucking together... What fucking together?! Is that what you learn from Creative Writing! Where are you from? Sampaloc, Ma'am. After you graduate from Creative Writing, what do you plan to practice? Practice what, Ma'am? A practice. A job. Your friend wants to be a poet, I guess. I want to put up a street food stand. Don't you have any plans of writing for a newspaper or magazine? Or write a book perhaps? I might someday. Or maybe write for the theater. What do you call the person who writes plays again? We haven't taken that up. Sorry, Ma'am. Oh, I want to show you something. This is the first poem your friend wrote. He was in graduate school. I haven't read this in a while. Kindly read it for me, please. My glasses are upstairs. I can barely ready the letters. So what's your forte? Poetry? Prose? Fiction? Non-fiction? Interpretative dancing... Come, Aries. I'll show you my latest poems. That one is pretty old. Ma, don't interrogate him. I was just simply asking. We'll go ahead, Ma'am. Thanks for the dinner. What does a fish normally eat? Smaller fishes. Where can he survive? In the water. How does he breathe? Through the gills. Why do you have that? So it will always be hard. You don't need that. Are you coming back? Is it hard to find a ride here? Why do follow me? Why did you leave me? That is as far as we can go. I still want to be with you. I want to go home. Besides, you'll find me in the bar. You shouldn't leave after having sex! Sorry, it's a force of habit. Like forgetting to collect your fee? I'll come with you. I'd like to see your world. My world is a filthy, rotten place. You won't survive a minute. In the movies, the woman smokes too, after the sex scene. See, there's our ride! Have a drink! Something to eat? And your friend? One for him, too. Happy New Year! Have something to eat. Where have you been? - At work. Let us pass, please. Happy New Year, Gentlemen. The air is just fine. Stinks a little, yes. I feel alive here! It's a bit dirty. Welcome to my aquarium. What's it called again? Biotope. .. Do you know Belinda's real name? What? Anacleto... Baldovino... Da Third! What about the impersonator? Aliya? Berto... Bend? Yes, Robert is his real name. In his hometown, they call him: "Bert, the fag, get's his mouth wide open." I feel sorry for him. So as much as he can hide behind someone else's face, he'll do it. Like using a different name? A name. A face. Like performing in a bar? Like dancing. They say we do it because it's the only thing that we're capable of. We didn't go to school. No college degree. Why do you dance? Because I choose to. You think it's just the money? When I'm on stage, I do get the respect. Even for just a brief moment, people look at us in a different way. We get rounds of applause. Admirations. People throw money at our feet. They lust for it. To touch. To caress. To fondle. To lick. To drool over. Have you ever roused someone to masturbate in front of you? And be looked upon and felt like getting stripped off your clothes? Your soul? You get poetic when you're drunk. Are you okay? I want to go home. You had a happy new year? Secret .. So what's your New Year's resolution? I will not argue with you anymore. You've said that last year. No, this time it's special. I will not argue with you, when it's about Daddy. Fair enough. I will not argue with you too, when it's about your collections. Cool! Your father called. What did he say? He'll visit us on Three Kings. What? Let's just wait for Valentine's Day. For the New Year's Day. Or Chinese New Year. Your father is as crazy as you.
