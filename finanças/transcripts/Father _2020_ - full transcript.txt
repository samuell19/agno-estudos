Where to? I want to talk to the manager. -You have an appointment? -No. I'm sorry, I can't let you through. I am Biljana Stojkovic. The wife of Nikola Stojkovic. I have a bottle of petrol in my hand. If you don't pay my husband's remaining salaries, and the severance package you've owed him for two years now... I'll set both myself and my children on fire. My children are hungry. We are hungry. We have nothing to live on. I mean it. I will set both myself and the children on fire. Put it out! Come on! There! FATHER Nikola! Let me give you a lift! Your wife was taken to the hospital. The children are fine, they weren't injured. But they're in a state of shock. Did you know what she was planning to do? No. Have you in any way encouraged her to do it? No. Notice anything odd in her behaviour lately? Sign here. Thanks. She was lucky, it could've been much worse. Once we've tended to her injuries, we'll transfer her to the psychiatric ward. -What about the children? -The children were not injured. They were taken over by an employee of the Centre for Social Work. -Can I see my wife? -No. To put it plainly, she's had a nervous breakdown. Doesn't recognise anyone, has no contact. She's sedated now, sleeping. We couldn't find you, the children were temporarily placed in foster care. The children told us you were a day worker, but they didn't know where. So, they'll stay there for a couple of days, until they've recovered from this trauma and until we've established whether you have adequate conditions to be the children's carer. Now, about that, people tell us the house hasn't been plastered, that the conditions in it are extremely poor. Do you have running water? -In the garden. -Electricity? They cut it off, two months ago. See, that's it, yes... Look, I want to help you. But all this tells us that the children live in poverty, in a house that is not functional. Get the man a glass of water, please. This is how we'll do it. On Wednesday, our employees will come to visit and officially evaluate the conditions the children live in, and then we will decide on the next step, on what the best and most acceptable thing for the children would be. That's the day after tomorrow, right? Wednesday is the day after tomorrow. So you try to get the house in order a bit. Have the electricity connected, get the running water. Fix it, clean it up a bit, especially the children's room. And sort out the bathroom... A fridge, do you have one? If you don't, get one. A fridge is important, especially in the summer. If we assess the house is suitable for the children to live in it, they'll be returned to you within a certain period of time, in accordance with the law and the children's best interests. Have you noticed anything that could indicate your wife's suicidal intentions? -I haven't. -Mood swings, depression? Well... We live a hard life, I lost my job two years ago. I haven't received my remaining salaries, or the severance package they promised. Thank you. Why didn't you take your wife her to see a doctor when you noticed she was depressed? I was working all day long. To feed my family. Can I see my children? They've been through a major stress. It will take a while for them to calm down. You won't be able to see them until then. Can I talk to them on the phone? No. We're concerned any contact could upset them even more. You need to know we're doing all this in your children's best interest. Neighbour! Come on in. May I ask you something? Go ahead. Let me get connected to your power supply. They'll come over from the Centre, about the children, once they're gone I'll have someone come and connect me to the street lamp. You can connect there. There's a separate counter, I made that for the old house, so... You pay as much as you spend. If you can't pay, you can do some work for me. Chop some wood, help around the house. Right. Thanks. No boiler? We always used to heat water on the stove. You have to have a boiler. You don't even have a heater in the bathroom. I wasn't told about the boiler. These are all the toys they have? Yes. Where are their clothes? In here. They have everything they need. Children should also have a computer. It's the 21st century. You haven't painted this room? I ran out of paint. Is everything in order? I did everything that was required of me. We can't tell you anything right now. We have to write the report first. Come to the Centre tomorrow at one. Come in. So. The house is more functional now, true, you got the water and the electricity, but it's still not enough of a warranty for us that you're capable of looking after the children. I did everything you told me to. The only warranty would be your having a full time job. Being a day worker can't reassure us that you're financially fit to provide minimum conditions for their proper upbringing. In the summer, fine, a lot of work in the fields or in construction. But winter is a different matter. But it's impossible to get a full time job nowadays. Right. I know it's hard. It's hard, but... Here, there's another aggravating circumstance. We got their medical records and it says here your wife and you hadn't brought your daughter in for vaccination in time. This is a serious misdemeanour. The foster parents say that the son, Milos, stutters. You should've taken him to a speech therapist. He hadn't stuttered before. I was willing to help you, cut you some slack. But we can't, we have to do everything in accordance with the law and in the best interest of your underage children. What interest? Our final assessment is that you're not capable of looking after the children, that, financially, you're not able to provide elementary conditions for them to grow up normally, you also failed to demonstrate sufficient amount of care as a parent. Add to that the trauma the children suffered from the other parent, we find and instruct that it is in the children's best interest to remain in foster care for an indefinite period of time. In this case, the Centre for Social Work is taking measures of urgent protection of minors and acts in accordance with articles 12, 332, 334, 335 and 339. The procedure has been carried out in accordance with article 282 of the Law on General Administrative Procedure. You're still here? Is there anything you need? Where am I supposed to get a job, you tell me. I don't know that. I'm not leaving until you bring me my children back. I've done everything you told me to do. There's nothing I can do to help you. The commission ruled this way. You have the right to an appeal, submit it within seven days and that's it. Office hours are over now. Come back tomorrow, I'll help you draft one. No. I will sit here and go on a hunger strike, until you bring me my children back. I have a right to that. Why are you making it more difficult for yourself? Boss... Why are you making a spectacle of yourself? I want you to bring me my children back. You promised. -I never promised you anything. -You said it was only temporary. Look, this kind of pressure doesn't work around here. You understand? We don't fall for that. The best thing would be for you to leave now and we'll forget about it. I can call the police! Tell them you're being aggressive, obstructing the work of the Centre. I'm not obstructing anything, I'm just sitting here. I understand you're stressed out. I'm telling you this for your own good. If the police come and write a report, the chances of getting your children back will be minimal. And I can have you evaluated too, then what? We pronounce you unaccountable, like your wife. Going on a hunger strike, being suicidal. Don't push me here. You have no right to do this. We do, by law, you bet we do, because we're in charge of this, not you. If I see you here tomorrow, you'll be in trouble, I'm telling you. Get me my bag, please. Here, boss. -Bye. -Bye. Here, have something to eat. No. I have to lock up now. You staying? Eat. Hunger strike is of no use. Word has it Vasiljevic sends all these children to foster families in his own village. To his relatives and his friends. The whole village works for him. They get forty thousand dinars from the state. They say there are over thirty children there. And Vasiljevic gets thirty percent. Per child. You do the math. Everyone knows that, but people are afraid. No one dares talk about it. You can file an appeal, but he gets to decide on your appeal too. You can sue him, but he has people at the court too. That's that. I'm right there. Come if you need anything. -Am I interrupting something? -No, come in. Don't take your shoes off, just come in. Milica, this is Nikola. My co-worker from the factory. When I worked there. -We got fired the same day, didn't we? -We did. He made the pipes for our chimney. Pleased to meet you. Did you manage to find a job? -I didn't. -Me neither. I do a bit of freelancing, write some applications for people, but that's all. Milica often goes to her sister's in Belgrade and takes care of old people. She makes a bit of money, that's what we live on... Until I've sorted something out. -Kosta, I wanted to ask for a favour. -What is it? Centre for Social Work took my children because I don't have a job, they won't return them. I want to go to Belgrade to appeal, can you write that up for me? -Appeal to whom? -The Minister. It will all end up in a drawer somewhere. No, I'll give it to him in person. Can I pay you next month though, if that's alright? I'll draft that free of charge. I don't charge for things like that. -Have a biscuit. -No, thanks... I brought you pyjamas and slippers. And some apples. Get in the car! Quick! You know it's forbidden to walk along the motorway? Where are you going anyway? To Belgrade. -On foot? -Yes. -You know how far it is to Belgrade? -I do. What will you do in Belgrade? Centre for Social Work took my children. So I wanted to submit this... appeal. -Is that for real? -Yes. This is fit for newspapers, honest. The fine for this is five thousand dinars. I don't have it. No money for the bus fare? We'll take you to the exit, but then you'll have to go through villages. What are you looking at me for? Can't give you any more, there won't be anything left for me. Nikola? Want me to give you a lift? Go on, get in. Get in! I hear you're going to Belgrade. It's the talk of the town. I'm afraid nothing's going to come out of this. They'll only lead you on. I'll be stopping in about two kilometres from here. -How are you going to go on? -On foot. To Belgrade? That's 300 km! You're out of your mind, man. You'll die. I want them to see I care. You think they care? They don't give a fuck. The only solution is to take justice in your own hands. You kidnap the kids, and I'll take you across the border, free of charge. I feel sorry for you, you're a good man. Go to Bosnia, they won't look for you there. You'll be a poor bastard there, like here, but at least you'll be with your kids. Go on, go on... Come on already, enough of this... I'm out of work too, Nikola, my man. I do what I can, I make do. I fucked them up by 300 kilometres or so. Oh, fuck, they made my whole van stink... Fucking hell, now I have to scrub the whole thing. I have to go back for another round, you can take this road there... My offer still stands. Call me when you make your mind up. Here. That's my number, so... give me a call. Alright. Can you breathe? You passed out by the side of the road. We need your health card, so we can register you. -Do you have your ID? -It's in my backpack. Alright, we'll do that later. Where are you from then? From Grab. A village near Priboj. What are you doing here then, where are you going? -To Belgrade. -On foot? You're not going anywhere now. You have high fever, you're exhausted, we need to get some tests done. Are you married, you have anyone at home? -A wife? -Yes, but she's in hospital. Don't move, you're weak, it'll take us two or three days to run these tests. And you get some rest till then, you know. Pops! How's it going, Pops? It hurts. You bet it hurts, did you think you came here to enjoy yourself? This is not a spa resort. Can you give me a hand? There's a balcony here, I want to have a smoke. So, you have someone in Belgrade? I don't have anyone. I'm going to hand in an appeal, Centre for Social Work took my children. You're going because of the kids? They had no right to take them from me. Mine left me here. I have four. Not one's called yet. What's your name? -Nikola. -Nikola. I don't think it pays to fight for your family. They'll let you down soon enough. You'll see. How many children do you have? Two, a daughter and a son. Nice. Let's get back in, Nikola. I have to go. -Where to? -I'm close. Give it back! -Thanks, bye. -Bye. Good evening, how can I help you? Excuse me, can I ask you something? -Yes, go ahead. -I'm travelling to Belgrade. I thought I'd be there by this evening, but it got dark. Where's your car? -I'm going on foot. -I see. If it's not a problem, could I lie down somewhere around here? I won't be in your way. I'll leave, if it's a problem. It's not a problem, it's just you'll have to leave before eight, that's when my boss arrives. No problem, I'll leave as soon as the day breaks. -This is the best I can do. -It'll do, thanks. Here you are. Thank you. Pardon me... Are you this man? It says here they took his kids and he's left for Belgrade on foot. That's not me. Sorry, I thought it was. Good night. What's up? What are you up to there? -Working, huh? -Just don't scratch it. Good, good, well done. We should bring him along one time. -No way! -But, it's boring! He couldn't even go to the market like this! Nah, he's a party maniac, he is! Why aren't you saying anything, mate? You need to get laid? Come here. This is so you can get your teeth done by next time. Thank you. And take your girlfriend out to dinner. Where are you off to this early? To Belgrade. -Looking for work? -I am going to the ministry. They took my children, they say I can't look after them. I'm going to submit an appeal. Open the glove compartment. Open it! They were blessed at Ostrog Monastery, have one. Go on. No, thanks. Take it, you'll need it, I have plenty. Only faith and Lord Almighty can help us. When all hope and men's assistance abandon you, Ask from the Lord. And you shall receive from where you never hoped or imagined you could. Do you believe in God? -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. I'm supposed to submit this. You can't submit anything today, the clerk's office closes at two. When can I come back? Tomorrow, from eight in the morning. -Can I get some water? -Yes, down the corridor there. Put the backpack through there first and then go in. MINISTRY OF LABOUR, EMPLOYMENT, VETERAN AND SOCIAL POLICY What do you think you're doing there? You can't just sit here, at the door of the ministry. Get out of here. You hear me? Get out of here. I didn't know. Someone's on strike here every now and again. Workers, veterans, the disabled, then I get in trouble for it. -Go on, scram. -I didn't come here to strike. My children were taken from me, I came to submit an appeal. Go to the back there, you won't be in the way there. Hello. This is Nikola Stojkovic, Biljana Stojkovic's husband. Yes. Can you please tell me how she's doing? Alright. I'll call back tomorrow. I have an appeal here, I came to hand it to the Minister. Let me have it. No, I'd like to give it to the Minister in person. That's not how it works around here. This is where appeals are submitted. I'm not leaving until I hand it to him in person. I could only call someone from upstairs so you can ask them yourself. Can I help you? What do you need? My name is Nikola Stojkovic. The Centre for Social Work took my children, I want them back. This is my appeal. Appeals are submitted at the clerk's office. I'd like to hand it to the Minister myself. I walked 300 kilometres for that. I'm sorry, that's not possible. You can send an email to request a meeting with the Minister's associate. We'll get back to you as soon as possible. But you will have to leave now. You bother the people who work here. I'll be right there, in front of the building. I'm not going anywhere until someone sees me. You don't have enough credit to complete this call. Good morning. I have information you're on strike here because your children were taken from you. Is this correct? Are you the man who walked all the way from.... where was it? -From Grab, near Priboj. -That's it. I read it in some local newspapers. Should we talk about it a little? About how they won't let you... -Stand there. -Where do you want the camera? Just have the building in the shot, doesn't matter. -What about the blanket and all? -We'll do that later, let's get this first. -Yes? -Can I use the bathroom? I can't let you in. That's what I was told. Are you Nikola? We saw you on television. Here you are. Excuse me. Sorry to bother you like this... we're from the early morning show. Can we have a short statement? You can stand here. Just a bit to the side. Right. I'm going to ask you how it happened, how your children were taken from you and I'll ask you how long you were planning to stay here for. -Ready? -Just a moment. Excuse me. Nikola, Mr. Jovanovic, the Assistant Minister, would like to talk to you. -It's fine, that's more important. -Don't film me, please. Come in. Good morning. Please, have a seat. Coffee, fruit juice? -Fruit juice is fine. -Fruit juice. A fruit juice for the conference room. Thanks. I'm very sorry about your problem, I saw the report and your statement last night. It's a horrible experience indeed. Quite moving, I have to admit. Can I have a look at that, please? -Here you have the... -I see. This is stupid bureaucracy, we'll sort it out immediately. Jelena, get this Vasiljevic on the phone for me, you have the number. How are you doing, by the way? So, you walked here? How long did it take you to get to Belgrade? It takes five days. Five days. You came across Avala, right? Yes. You're tired, I suppose. I am, a bit. Admirable. No one's picking up. Alright, I'll write a recommendation to return the children and resolve your appeal in your favour, but that's only a recommendation. It's not your fault you don't have a job. This would mean poor people have no right to have children. So I'll sign it myself. Believe me, it's not easy for them at the Centre either, they see all sorts of things. Not everyone's like you, believe me. Their job is to protect the children's interests. You know, we often say poverty is also a form of violence against children. Of course, it's completely different in your case. You've proven that you care, you made a great sacrifice to get your children back. Parents' love is the most important thing for children. I haven't seen my children since they took them. They wouldn't let you? Jelena, when you reach them, tell them to bring the children tomorrow at 12, so the man can see them. By law, you have the right to see the children once a week at the centre. I'll have to have a word with this Vasiljevic. Fine, would you please just wait outside until I write this for you, alright? Of course. Now I would like to ask you for something. Could we have a picture of us, for twitter? -Yes, sure. -Jelena? -Of course. -Let's stand there. Thank you. Thank you. -Do you have money for the fare back? -I do, yes. No, don't, it's fine. Get some chocolate for the children tomorrow. Thanks. Thank you. -How much is this chocolate? -Eighty dinars. -I'd like to get two for 120. -How about these? -Fine. And some apples for 30 dinars. -Here you go. Thanks. Have a nice day. I've been to Belgrade, to the ministry. People are willing to help. It will all turn out fine, you'll see. There you are. Take a seat, go ahead. Well, the situation here is as follows. At any rate, this recommendation is helpful and it is in our interest, as it is in yours, for this whole thing to be resolved as soon as possible. However, this is not in any way binding for us. This is merely a recommendation from the ministry. It's not bad that you have it, but it's the Centre itself that decides on each case, including yours. And you know our opinion. That's how it is, it's the law. Article 212 of the Law on Family Relations says it's on the local centre to make decisions on that. So, to be honest, I don't know why they even gave you this. They told me it was sorted. They can't make decisions on our behalf in Belgrade and tell us what to do. They told you wrong. I wanted to help you out, man to man. But you're making a spectacle of yourself. Strolling to Belgrade, going on television... I wanted to do it the nice way. But this is how you pay me back. Very well... fine... The commission will be in session again in one month, but your chances of getting your children back are slim. Even if you do get a full time job now, we can always prove you're not a responsible father and not able to look after the children. After all, it is our estimate anyway. You can sue us... That will take years. And you don't have money for all that, all those lawyers and stuff... And I also happen to know some people at this court. I want to see my children. It's already quarter past twelve. -The appointment was at twelve. -Not today. They have some activities they couldn't postpone. We'll call you in the next couple of days, when they're available. The appointment was today. I want to see them, I'm not leaving this office until you bring them here. Listen. You're not exactly in a position to press anyone. By law, I am entitled to see them once a week. I want to see them, I haven't seen them for two weeks. Haven't you heard what I said? They have some activities today, how should I know what. They are my children. I want to see them. I don't know how to organise it for you now. Very well. Fine, you'll see them now. And then you can go to Belgrade another five times if you like, get it? You can bring a recommendation from the President himself. We're the ones who decide on your case. We are. You'll have to wait until their foster parents bring them over. -I'll wait for as long as it takes. -But not in here. We have a room for that over there, that's where they'll bring them. You shouldn't have said all those things around Belgrade. But never mind... Daddy's girl... Milos! How are you? Are you alright? Dad's brought you... some chocolate. Here... -Milos? -I don't want it. Come here... Is that one alright? When are you coming to pick us up, dad? As soon as they let me. Why don't you take us home now? I can't do it now. But I'll come soon. Excuse me, can we be by ourselves for a bit? Daddy's little rascal... -How is it where you are? -Fine. We have friends. There's this crazy dog, we hang around with him all day. -What's it called? -Rex. We'll get a dog too, when you come back home. -Are you going to school? -Yes. Where have you been, dad? I had to do some things, in Belgrade. And it took a while. Dad, can we go home with you now? Not now, Milos. As soon as I'm allowed. When is that going to be? Soon. Why are you lying to us? Come here. You left us. I didn't son, I'd never leave you. I'll come to get you soon. Mum will come home soon too, she's doing better, I went to visit her. We'll all be together again soon. I've done some work around the house, painted the rooms, got water and electricity. Another couple of things to do so it's really pretty when you come back. Believe me, I'll come and bring you home. The children should get going. You say goodbye here, we don't allow contact with foster parents. See you soon. Just take it easy, please. Milos! -Milos, get in the car! -Easy, please. Don't touch him! You stop there and don't move. I'll come and pick you up soon, I promise. Come now, go on. Go on, son. I'm sorry it all turned out like this. Come and see me on Monday, I want to help you. Alright. Neighbour. Where are my things? Someone broke in and then everyone started taking things. -Who? -Everyone. Except for me and grandpa Misa. They thought you weren't coming back.
