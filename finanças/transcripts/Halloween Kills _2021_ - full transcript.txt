Did you see him? - Where did he go? - Where have you guys been? I called for backup ten minutes ago. Easy, rookie. Loomis said he shot him multiple times in the chest. I saw from 50 yards away. He crossed right here and then just disappeared. Okay. Sullivan, you and Tobias search Chestnut, south to the bypass. Hawkins and I will track Market Street up to Lampkin. We'll catch him. Yeah, kill the bad guy. Jesus, Frank. I used to know the guy. - Michael. We were kids. - Yeah? Was he one of those weirdo freaks who used to pluck the wings off butterflies when he was a kid? Not that I ever saw. He was just... Just killed his sister when he was six years old? Yeah. My mom used to make me go over to his house to play. She felt bad. But he would just spend the whole time staring out of his sister's bedroom window. I always remember thinking, "The hell is he looking at out there?" He was looking at Haddonfield. Simple town where nothing exciting ever happens. Yeah. Then one day, he just snapped. Lonnie, Lonnie, weird and scrawny. Has bad dreams, so cries to mommy. He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you, Lonnie. He's gonna get you. Touch Conrad's candy again, I swear to God I'll beat your ugly ass! Yeah, we'll beat your ugly ass. That's right! I didn't do it. It wasn't me. - It was Richie. - Then show me. Open your hand right now. - No. - Why don't you open up your hand? I don't want to. - Get off. - Open your hand! Leave me alone. Yeah, okay. That's what you get when you fuck with the Mullanys. Get away from me! Leave me alone! Hey. Everything all right with you kids? Yeah. Just trick-or-treating with our new old friend Lonnie. What? You... You kids see anyone walking around in a white mask? It's Halloween. Everyone's wearing a mask. That's right. I need you to go home right now. Go home to your parents and lock your doors. - Why? What did he do? - What did he do? He murdered three teenagers down the street. Don't get murdered, Lonnie. Sleep with one eye open, Lonnie. He's gonna get you, Lonnie Elam! - Boogey, Boogey. - Did you see his face? Lonnie, Lonnie, weird and scrawny. Has bad dreams, so cries to mommy. Be careful, Lonnie. He's gonna get you, Lonnie. He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you, Lonnie. Sleep with one eye open, Lonnie. He's gonna get you, Lonnie. He's gonna get you, Lonnie Elam. Help. Help!

You-you didn't see him? - Take a deep breath. - Who? The Boogeyman. - He's gonna kill you! - Whoa. Hey, hey. - Boogeyman? - What the hell? That's it. That's the Myers house. That's where it happened. Halloween, 1963. Hey, Frank? Yeah. There's a dead dog in here. What? Nothing. Don't shoot! - Frank. Frank. - What? Oh, sh... Go for it. Three, two, one. Okay. Crazy. Ugh. Spiderwebs. Haddonfield.

Michael, stay back. Hold it right there! ...description of the subject for confirmation. - It's him. - It's him. It's Michael Myers. Officer Hawkins, tell me, what happened in here?

Hey, look here, don't be bothered by them motherfuckers over there, man. They are friends with that crazy lady that almost got killed by Michael Myers. No shit. I-I heard about that. Wha... Uh, Laura Stropes or something. - Laurie Strode. - Strode, yeah. The one that survived Michael Myers. They come here every Halloween, and, you know, tears in their beers. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce our next thespian. Now, I used to bust this guy's balls when we were kids, but he is all grown-up now. And he's become the most captivating bird whistler. - Hey, everybody. - All right, Tommy! Uh, Lonnie put me up to this shit. Uh, I'm not gonna whistle for you. I'm, uh... I'm gonna tell you a story. - Ghosts and goblins! - Oh... - You got this, Tommy! - Turn off the lights! Any of you know the story of the Haddonfield Boogeyman? Too young to give a shit? Too drunk to remember? 40 years ago, a madman escaped from a mental hospital. It was the night before Halloween, and three teenage girls were walking home from Haddonfield High. They had sightings of a... a ghostlike figure creeping right through our town. A man in a white mask. Or was it more than a man? He was watching them. Before the night was over, three people would be murdered. And in the house next door, there was a babysitter and a young boy and a young girl, and they were brutally attacked by this stalker who had a power beyond any mortal man. My name is Tommy Doyle. And I was that young boy. So, please, join me in commemorating the victims and the survivors of Michael Myers. Thank you. Now, we have, uh, the lovely Miss Lindsey Wallace. Her babysitter, Annie Brackett, was executed that night. And we have Miss Marion Chambers. She survived an assault. We have Lonnie Elam. Lonnie survived a face-to-face encounter. Help! It's Halloween night in Haddonfield. When terror's supposed to be fun. When we hide behind masks and we pretend we aren't what we are. Is he real? Who knows? Who's next? Maybe not tonight, maybe not tomorrow, but the Boogeyman is coming for me. And he's coming for you. But he's not gonna get us. Not this time. Because we will never succumb to fear. This is for you, Laurie. Wherever you are. We're almost at the hospital, Mom. Take deep breaths. Deep breaths. We're almost there. We're almost at the hospital. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. It's good. It's good. It's okay. It's okay. No, no, no, no. - No, no, no, no, no! - No! Oh, let it burn! No! Let it burn! Copy that. Utilities are being shut down. We got a gas-fed fire in here. Ten-four. Stand by. Copy. Assignment complete. - Utilities are disengaged. - Copy. - Eyes on the roof. - Watch out. With you. Let's move. All right, let's go. Command Ladder 13, do you copy? Mayday. Mayday. Radio silence. We have a Mayday alert. This is Benton with Engine Eight. There's been a structural collapse. My air supply has been compromised.

Activate the trauma team. We got an unconscious female - with an abdominal injury. - Can you hear me, Mom? Possibly penetrating, multiple contusions. Mom, can you hear me? She's losing a lot of blood. Ma'am, can you tell me your name? Allyson, wait here, honey. Ma'am, can you tell me your name? Um, uh, that's... that's my mom. It's Laurie Strode. - Strode. She was attacked. - Laurie. She's, uh... she's my mom. Sh-She's been attacked. She has probably... Ma'am, I-I think you should really let a nurse look at you. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's not my blood. Okay? It's not my blood. We'll close up the fascia, and, uh, we'll loosely staple the, uh, skin so it doesn't get infected. She's lost a good bit of blood, but it's all controllable. I think she'll be fine. Get her to the floor, into the ICU tonight. The internal organ will be repaired, and so there shouldn't be any long-term damage. Her only concern will be her abdominal wall will be very sore from the knife wound and from our midline incision here. Thank you for everything. Honey. Hey. She's gonna be okay. She's gonna be okay. Dad's gone. He'll always be with us. Even if we can't see him. No, I'm not afraid to go. I just don't feel like it. Besides, I sort of promised my father we-we were going to the movies.

That's right next door to our house. ...two patients of the local Smith's Grove State Hospital unaccounted for after yesterday's transport bus escape. Authorities have not confirmed a connection between those two events, but police are encouraging all residents to remain inside until further information is released. Tonight's tragedy an eerie reminder of an event in Haddonfield history this community has spent decades trying to forget. But police now believe that more people...

He stabbed his sister in the tits. - Yuck. - Right upstairs. And sometimes, when the wind blows just right, we can still hear her ghost calling out his name. Oh, sh-she calls. Mm-hmm. Michael. Michael... Get out of my yard, you little perverts! Wh-What was that? All right, let's go. Let's get him into code room three. - What have we got here? - Internal bleeding, lacerations, but he's gonna make it. Call Respiratory for a ventilator. - Officer Hawkins. - Go. Go, go, go. Make sure trauma two is prepped. And I need help getting him on the table. Allyson. Allyson. Hey. Can I speak with you? Ask you a few questions? I was always told that I couldn't... I couldn't talk about Michael. I could never acknowledge the tragedy. It was as if my mother's biggest fear was that my grandmother was right and the Boogeyman was real. For 40 years, he was waiting to come and kill my mother. He found where she lived. He came to her house. She put us in his path. He murdered my husband. That's what happened. Well, so how did Michael know? How did he know how to find your grandmother? He didn't. It was his doctor. Michael's doctor. He is the one that... He took him there. He knew where to go. And he's the one that brought them together. It was his obsession, not Michael's. But we got him. Shot him in the face, burned him alive so he can't hurt anyone ever again. I'm sorry, Karen. Thank you. No one told you? Told me what? Michael Myers is alive. What?! Allyson, Allyson! Allyson, are you okay? - Oh, sorry. - Slow down. - Allyson, please wait. - Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I just want to help in any way I can, okay? - He's still alive. - We're going after him. Me, my dad, you, if you want to come. We're joining Tommy Doyle. You need to get everybody here now. If he is alive, he is on his way here. Mom. Honey, I want you to go and sit in Grandmother's room and wait there until she wakes up, okay? - No. - No, no, no. She-she's coming with us. - We're joining Tommy Doyle. - She what? I don't know if you've heard, but they've... No, the police officers should be on their way here right now. Tommy's organizing groups, groups of people that care. We're gonna go after him. We're gonna find Michael. I'm going with them. We're gonna hunt him down, - and we're gonna put an end to this. - Yeah. No, he is on his way here. I keep telling them that. He is stalking her, and we are staying here to protect her. He's infected your family, he's infected my family with grief and fear for 40 years. He's gonna die tonight. - He killed Dad. - Clear the hallway! You have to move! Excuse me! My husband, he's been very badly hurt! Clear the hallway, people. Go back to the waiting area. Go back to the waiting room. Clear the hallway. I'm not gonna pretend this didn't happen. I love Dad, and somebody loves whoever is laying under those sheets right now. Look. Look at me. We failed, baby. We set a trap, we set the whole thing on fire, and he lived through it. Think about that. The police are out there looking for him. You think you're the one that's gonna find him? Sit in that room and wait with your grandmother. Now! Does the hospital have security guards? Do you have security guards? It seems like you should have security guards in case something like this happens. And this is happening right now. I mean, my daughter is in here, my mother is in here, there is a madman on the loose... Oh! Oh, God! Goodbye, Michael. This is for you, whenever you need it. She's here. She's here. We found her. Laurie's here. She's in recovery. It's lucky she survived. I just heard from one of the police officers at her compound. 11 dead bodies. They're all first responders. Holy shit. Cameron's in there. Three of his friends were killed. - It's a madhouse. - All right, Lonnie, listen. The only way we're gonna stop this is if we all come together on this. You're goddamn right. - All right. All right. - All right? How about this sassy tackle? You have a permit for all these? Some of 'em. - Dad. - Hey, hey. - Where's your girlfriend? - Uh, she's okay. - She's gonna stay with her family. - Good for her. - Hey, Mr. Doyle. - Hey, buddy. Lonnie, check it out. You guys are coming, too? Couldn't let you have all the fun. So many victims in our neighborhood. Close friends of ours, and we just want to help out. I'm a doctor. My husband's a nurse. I should've guessed. All right, we have to give all these people protection. - You got to share your shit, Lonnie. - All right. You coming with us? Let's see what you got. Yeah, just help yourself. Michael Myers has haunted this town for 40 years. Tonight, we hunt him down. Excuse me. I need some good people. People who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. Everybody else needs to go home. So, what do we do if we find him? Go inside. Go inside. It's not safe to be out. Go. It's not safe to be out. Man, I had an altercation with Myers about an hour ago, but he escaped. Now, listen, boys, there's strength in numbers. You cover Spring Creek to the bypass, and then let me know if you see anything. This man is a threat, and we need to stop him tonight! Nobody ever took him seriously. - Who? - Dr. Loomis, Michael's first doctor. He knew a killer when he saw one. Now, the only way to catch him is to play by his own game... the element of surprise. So he thinks you're going one place, then you pop up someplace else. And keep your eyes open. Eyes open. Wait, what's going on over there? Baby, who is that? Looks like kids. They all alone? Marion, give me the flashlight. It's the wrong night to be out. Careful, Lindsey. - Lindsey, I wouldn't go... - Stay here. Never fired a gun before. Right, so I don't even know why they gave you a gun. It's big, too. Can you handle it? That's a no. Give me, give me. I shot this shit before. Okay. If you want it. I got it. Okay. Fine. Hey. What are you guys doing out here? It's Halloween. We've been trick-or-treating. - We got a whole bag of candy. - You guys should not be out here right now, okay? It's not safe. - You gonna kill me? - No. Satan, not today. - Oh, I'm so scared. - Are you guys alone? - Where are your parents? - No. No, we're waiting for our friend. And, like, there's a creepy man in a white mask, and he keeps, like, trying to play hide-and-seek with us, - and he thinks... - And I think he's a pervert. Where did you see him? He's just hiding behind trees. And he pops out like, "Peekaboo!" I mean, we're not three years old. - Come on, man! - Oh, look, there he is. - Oh, hello! - Hello. What the hell are you doing? You want some candy? Is that Dennis's mask? Run. Go home now. Before he kills us all! Get out of here! Run! Do not turn around! Keep going home! Oh, my God. What if someone is disabled? - Like, that doesn't make any sense... - Yeah, but... What the hell is that? - What the fuck? - It's Michael. Fuck this bullshit! Drive! Go! Go! Drive the fucking... God! - No, whoa! Jesus, Marion. - Marion, watch it! - Marion, the door's locked! - I don't want to die in here! - Unlock the door! - Unlock the door! - Oh! - Come on! - Let me out of here! - Move! He's behind you! - The door's locked, Marion. - Move! Go, go! Vanessa, go! Get out of the fucking car! I love you, baby! No! Let go of her! - Okay, come on. We got to go. We got to go. - Oh, God. No. Shoot him! Shoot him, Marion! Hey, Michael. This is for Dr. Loomis. - Oh, God. No! - Marion! Come on. Die. Die, die, die! Mom. Oh, God. No, wait. Stop, stop, please. Take it easy. Take it easy. - I'm fine. - You're not fine. You had a knife in your fucking stomach. It's a paper cut. Where's Allyson? She was supposed to be in here, with you. - You didn't see her? - Nah... I'm so geeked out on pain meds, kiddo. Uh, uh, no. Is everything okay? She probably just needed some fresh air. My God, they just leave your bloody shirt just sitting here? Karen. Karen. Michael's gone. We got him. That's right. We got him. We burned him to the goddamn ground. Excuse us. Pardon. - Uh, over here. - Frank? - Go a little further back. - Okay. Okay. - Got the draw sheet? - Yeah. One, two... There you go. Okay. You knew my dad? Yeah, I knew Ray. He used to sell me peyote. I remember once we were out on Lake Cherokee in this canoe with a shaman from Little Rock. Your-your daddy got freaked out by his own reflection. He took off his pants, and he jumped in. I stopped doing drugs with him, but I'll-I'll miss him. - Dad. - What? It's true. No, no, no. Dad, look, right there. You see that? That's Tommy. - Yeah. - Whose car is that? Lindsey's. Shit. Lindsey's car. It's covered in blood. There's no bodies. It's Michael. He's here. Come on, I need you guys. Come on. Be careful now, all right? Keep your heads up, eyes open. Okay. Let's go, let's go. Lindsey! - Okay. - Just be safe, okay? You, too. Lindsey! Lindsey! Lindsey! - Marion! - Marion! You guys be careful, okay? Keep your heads up. Oh, shit, Tommy. Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Fuck me. Yo, Dad, Dad. What's over there? We found something. Oh, God. Oh, I'm sorry. - That's Marion, Lonnie. - He did this. Oh, God, Marion. Tommy, what the fuck? I'm gonna get you. Come and get it, man. Over here. She's over here. I saw his face. I saw everything. He's still out there. - She's lucky to be alive. - I saw him. You saw his face? He's still out there, Tommy. You'll be okay, Lindsey. You're gonna be okay. He's still out there. Frank. Frank, are you awake? Do you remember that night? At the bar? You know, I-I never said anything, 'cause I couldn't be sure. I was so messed up. But you helped me. I always liked you. You so crazy. Fuck you. Hi. Hi. I remember that night. Yeah. I kissed you. Yeah. I remember. You held my hand. That was it. Now, I was hoping for more. But I knew you were sweet for... Ben Tramer. Frank. We got him. We killed Michael. You ki... Well, it's about time. Ow. Ow. Don't make me laugh. Oh, good. You're awake. Now, on a scale from one to ten, what is your pain level, with ten being the worst? Number 11. This will make the pain go away. Laurie. Nurse, will you do me a favor? Help out my friend here. Make it a double. You stood up to that monster. I tried, Tommy. You know, when we were kids, we used to all dare each other to sneak into the old Myers house. Lonnie was the only one brave enough to do it. I lied. I never made it inside. When they arrested Michael that night, I was telling my wife that my daughter was killed, so I wasn't there to put a bullet in his brain, like we should have. This is no time for prudence. How'm I supposed to know if my brother's alive or not? - I-I don't know. - I've been waiting here for over an hour. Who the hell's in charge here? Authorized medical and security personnel only. There's not enough medical or security help. - He's going to kill everybody! - You need to relax. We've requested backup officers and medical staff from Russellville and Eaton County for support, but no confirmation. We can't handle this scope a crime scene. My son. My son Oscar, is he here? Uh, I got a call. I'm his mother. Is he alive? I have no idea, but triage expansion just opened up. I'm gonna have you sign in right here. It's spelled B-E-R-L-U-C-C-H-I. Clear the hallway, please. Somebody help! Please, emergency. Take her to the emergency room, please. You're gonna be okay, Linds. He's still out there, Tommy. - Be careful. - Karen. How are you doing? How's your mom? - How's Laurie? Is she okay? - Where's my daughter? She's okay. She's fine. She's with Lonnie and Cameron. No, no, but he's coming here. She's not supposed to be with them. He's coming here? How do you know that? All right, secure a perimeter. Hospital's on lockdown. All right, listen, folks. Listen! Folks, please. The Boogeyman is at large. He's got no choice but to emerge. He is an apex predator. When he surfaces, there will be no pause. There will be no empathy. This ends when Michael is dead! Michael Myers will be executed tonight, and it will not go without witness! We need all of you. Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! All right, everybody, calm down. The Sheriff's Department has this... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sheriff, we will not calm down. We have watched your department fail... - fail tonight! - Tommy's right! This is Haddonfield. This is our town. He killed my daughter 40 years ago and desecrated her body. Evil dies tonight. Goddamn it, Brackett! I am the law, not you. - Fuck off, Barker. - Jonesy, get over there! Robin, I need you up there. I need you over here. You two... Laurie! - Tommy, you can't go in there! - Tommy? - Tommy, you can't go in there! - Laurie. Laurie. - Tommy! - Tommy. - Laurie. He killed Marion. - Tommy. - And he attacked Lindsey, too. - What? Karen. We didn't know for sure. I didn't know what to tell you. Mom, I just want you to be okay. Listen, I just want you to know, when he gets here, I'm gonna fucking kill him, because 40 years ago, - when I was a kid, you protected me. - Yeah. So, tonight, I'm gonna protect you. Okay? Nurse. You know, I appreciate you, but could you get out, please? Like, get out now! We had him. How did he escape? I don't know. I don't know. What do we do? We don't have the police support. We fight. We always fight. - Go! Find him, Tommy! - Yeah. I will. I will. - I... No. - Mom, don't. Don't. I need you to listen to me. You need to listen to me right now, okay? All right, a lifetime of preparation, and for what? Ray is dead. So many people are dead. We're not equipped. Allyson's run off with crazy Lonnie Elam. People are losing their minds. There are authorities who are trained to deal with exactly this kind of... this... There's a system. Well, the system failed. Now, get the fuck out of my way. - Don't. No. No. - No, no, no. Get away. - What are you doing? - Karen, no! - Stop right now! - Get away! I am not gonna let you do this. - No. Mom. - Get out of my way. - Move! - Mom, please, what are you doing? Do you even know what that is? It makes the pain go away. Let him come for me. No. Let him take my head as I take his. - No. - Maybe the only way he can die is if I die, too. - No. - Karen, you and Allyson should not have to keep running because of the darkness that I created, honey. So you just have to let me go. - Karen, move! - Mom, stop. Stop, Mom. Listen. Mom. Stop. I am not gonna let anything happen to you. We want to get married. Um... Uh, I-I guess, uh, right away. Right away, yeah. Right away. The waggle dance is how bees communicate. They share the information where the flower is with the rest of the colony. They communicate the precise location by shaking their butts. What is in that honey? Hey, Mom, he wants to talk to you. Hello, Mom. Seymour Moskowitz. Right. Jewish. My mom kept bees before she died. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. And now they're at the back door. Halloween's over, kids! I'll handle it. Knock it off! Well, now they're at the front door. Let's scare the shit out of these kids. John. Don't you know whose house this was? Huh? Honey, don't do anything stupid. We don't want to get sued. I bet those bitches are in the bushes. Did you lock the back door? Uh... I'll check. Next time, I'm coming with a pitchfork. Big John? Big John? Yes, Little John? Someone's in our house. And it's not a child. Fuck that. I got this knife. I got this knife. Fuck off, man. Get out of my face. Lonnie, where are you? I'm at the hospital right now. Yeah, I brought her in to E.R. Is that him? I saw that guy on TV. Back, back, back. You know what I mean? I have no answer for you. Help me. Help me! Tommy, what's happening? - I don't know. - Who is it? Um... - Help me! - Who is it? Is it Michael? - Is it him? - I don't know. - It's Michael. Michael's here. He's not wearing his mask! - It's Michael. - Michael! Michael! Stop! Stop! Mom, Mom, you're not going near him. - I'm gonna go. - No, you're not. Block the doorway! Don't let him leave! - He's getting away. - Tommy, get him! Excuse me. Evil dies tonight! - Evil dies tonight! - Come on! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Little John? Big John. Yeah. Little John? Big John. Little John, the study's clear. Big John! Big John. No. Big John. Michael. You've come home. No! No, no, no, that's not... - That's not him. It's not him! - It's not him? It's not him! - That's not Michael! - It's not him! - It's not him! It's not him! - Get him! It's not him! You fucking sheep, it's not him! - It's not him! It's not him! - Get out of the way! Mom, Mom, Mom! Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom! I got to get you out of here. Tommy! Get back here! Help! Help! Somebody help me! Mom! Okay. Okay. Okay, be careful. - I got it, Sheriff. - You're gonna be okay. - Come on. - Get him! - It's not him. - I know, Mom. I got her. I got her. Go, go, go. - It's... not him. - Your arm. - All right, let's get her... - They're after the wrong guy. - Let's get her into bed. - It's not him. It's not Michael. Get out of the way! Okay, Mom. Come on. We got you. All right, gentle. Careful. Careful. I can handle this. Be careful of your head. Okay. All right. - Are you okay? - Yeah. All right, look, stay here. There's gonna be guards outside the door, all right? - Be careful. - I'm gonna get a nurse to get you - all hooked up again, okay? - You be careful. Hospital staff sightings on the second floor. Please stop! Please! It's not Michael! You don't know what he looks like! We're in the stairwell. Move! Watch it, asshole. Karen. You okay? Here, move over to the side. To the side with them. Careful, careful. - He's up there! - Stop! It's not him! - Get out of my way! - Tommy, stop! Chill out. Get a grip, Tommy! Get the fuck out of the way! Knock it off! Tommy! We're gonna kill him! Evil dies tonight! It's all happening. Michael's masterpiece. He created this chaos, but... I'm the one that brought it all onto Haddonfield. I could have made all this go away. It was that night that you were attacked. It's not your fault. It's mine. It was an accident. I was lost in my own regret. Did Michael kill again? I saw the look in Loomis's eyes. All he wanted was more blood. More death. And I couldn't take it. And then in that moment, all I could think was that inside that monster, there was somebody's baby boy. Purely and simply evil. No! Don't! I could have made all this go away. It's not your fault. It's mine. But now I know... ...there's nothing inside that man but pure evil. It's not just Michael. It's what he's done to this town, these people. Decent people. You're a good man, Frank. You were doing your job. But now it needs to die. 'Cause every time somebody's afraid, the Boogeyman wins. It needs to die. And I'm the one that needs to kill it. It's not you. I know it's not you. I'm not gonna hurt you. I know you're scared. They're scared, too. I'm not gonna let them hurt you. Okay. Okay. I know. I know. I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna help you. Okay, come on. Come on. Let go of my hand. That's good. I'm gonna lock these doors. Okay. Okay. Lock this behind me. They're coming. They're coming. Come on! I'm not gonna let them hurt you. It's him. Get him! Get him! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! Stop them! It's not him? - Move! - Evil dies tonight! Evil dies tonight! - Oh, my God. - He's dead. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. Evil dies tonight! Leigh! Leigh! No. It's not him. It's not him, Tommy. He's always worn a mask. How do we know it's not him? How do we know, Leigh? Now he's turning us into monsters. I swear I was just trying to do the right thing. Look at me. What I'm thinking is the killer was choking him, Pete went for his gun. As he pulled it up, it went off. Give me your gun. Don't look at it. Just be cool and give me your gun. Take this. It was an accident. He shot himself. Got it? Just because your intentions are good doesn't mean things always work out. I stood in the way. It was me. - It wasn't him. - Let me find him, then. He's after me. No, he's not. Frank. He's not. It was the doctor that took him to your house tonight. It wasn't Michael. It's not about you. - Doctor, get back in the car! - No! I'm still gonna blow this motherfucker's brains out. Mom! Mom! Help! He's a six-year-old boy with the strength of a man and the mind of an animal. I know. I've seen his face. I looked in his eyes when I took off his mask. Did you know that when he was a little boy he used to stand in his sister's bedroom and... stare out the window? My partner died the night he stood on that same spot. But for an instant, before his death, he knew. Maybe he wasn't looking out. Maybe he was looking in. At his reflection. At himself. Who knows what makes him kill, what motivates him? But in his heart, it always seemed to me he wants one thing. He's going home. - He went from Laurie's compound... - Mm-hmm. ...the victims in her neighborhood, to the park, okay? If you track those locations, that's a straight line, basically an arrow pointing straight to Lampkin Lane, Michael's childhood home. I came face-to-face with this asshole when I was a kid. He creeps, he kills, he goes home. Then that's where we're going. Yeah. Karen. Karen. Listen, I'm sorry. You were right, okay? I'm sorry. Tommy, you took my daughter to chase a killer, and an innocent man is dead. Fuck it. None of us are innocent. Karen, listen. Listen. I fucked up. I fucked up. I'm sorry. So, what now? You're sorry? You're just gonna stand here hating yourself? No. I got to keep trying. But if I go down, I'm gonna go down swinging. I need a car. I have a car. Okay, so the key is we stick together. No, I'm going in alone. - What? - Mr. Elam. You fucking dummy, you brought your kid - to the belly of the beast. - Dad, no. Mr. Elam, with all due respect, you really expect me to sit here while you go inside and confront the man that killed my father? No, I don't expect you to. But I'm asking, Allyson. For your sake and my son's. Okay? Just stay here. You see anything suspicious, you honk the horn, all right? But you stay safe. All right? I will see you at the finish line, buddy. Okay. This is so fucked up. Cameron, let's go. Come on. Go, go, go, go! Okay. Dad? Allyson.

Do it. Do it! Mom. Mom. No, Mom. You want your mask? Come and get it! You want to fucking kill someone, take me! Mom. No, Mom. I'm an innocent woman, just like your sister was. It was Halloween night. She was in her bedroom. And it was right here. Your house. Can't you feel it? No. No, Mom. Mom, no. Mom! Gotcha. Hey, Michael. It's Halloween. Everyone's entitled to one good scare. - Light him up. - Let's take him. We got this, Karen. Go be with your daughter. I always thought Michael Myers was flesh and blood, just like you and me, but a mortal man could not have survived what he's lived through. The more he kills, the more he transcends into something else impossible to defeat. Fear. People are afraid. That is the true curse of Michael. He'll always be here, won't he? Even when we can't see him. You can't defeat it with brute force. If we only knew then what we know now. It is the essence of evil. The anchor that divides us. It is the terror that grows stronger when we try to hide. If they don't stop him tonight, maybe we'll find him tomorrow. Or next Halloween, when the sun sets and someone is alone.
