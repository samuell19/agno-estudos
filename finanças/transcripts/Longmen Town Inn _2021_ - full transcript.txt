Twenty years ago, there was an invincible swordsman renouncing the world splendidly named Wolong. This man had skillful swordsmanship. He challenged the best of all sects without a single defeat. In just a few years, he became well-known and had more enemies. In the end, he fought against all masters at Broken Soul Cliff. That day, Wolong was the only one who survived. But after the battle, Wolong went to live in seclusion out of the blue. No one knew the reason. Many years later, the Rakshasa Sect from Western Regions entered Central Mainland. They searched high and low to hunt Wolong down and kill him. Almost at the same time, there were rumors that Sword Immortal Wolong founded Longmen Town Inn. Our Qingcheng Sect has never interfered in others' affairs. Just because it was said that Sword Immortal Wolong had met our Master once before going to live in seclusion, our whole sect was slaughtered. A man is sure to take his revenge. Fellow brother Tian, be patient. Sixth fellow brother, go and gather some firewood outside the yard. Don't do it. There is no turning back after practicing this Blood-Reversing Manual. We can go to Longmen Town. If your Gods and Buddhas are real, they should cast those Rakshasa beasts to hell. Where is Longmen Town? It is heard that Longmen Town is in the deep desert. If it had not been for the Longmen local guide, no one in the world would have found the place. So what if we find it? They're just a bunch of stray dogs in hiding. Hold your breath. It's no good, Sixth fellow brother. Look out! Before that old man died, did he tell you where Longmen Town is? She's Luo Xiaoman, daughter of Luo Yueniang, the manager of Longmen Town Inn. Inform Young Master. Pingan. I told you when we are outside, call me Boos Wei. I mean, why don't we just call it a day? Picking-pocket or stealing is fine with us, but, but hijack? Nothing ventured, nothing gained. What are you afraid of? Get ready to pull the rope. Where is the rope? Here. Those rats are nothing at all. Making a joint attack is the only thing they know. And I happen to have a blade method that can break them. But I can't do it with all my might when someone is next to me. You should go first. There's a river thirty miles away by the dead woods. I will find you there. Bai Wuji. Blood-Reversing Manual. Luo Xiaoman is thirty miles away by the river near the dead woods. Before that, let's find out those rats who are showing their tails but hiding their heads. Pingan. What to do? Are you the hero of the Rakshasa Sect? It seems you are. Somebody up there loves me. We three brothers grew up hearing that Rakshasa Sect is full of heroes who maintain a stark sense of good and evil, and would never... Trash. Kill them. Please spare our lives, sir! Sir! Wait. You are still alive. Sir, do you know me? Do you want to join Rakshasa Sect badly? That's my lifelong wish. All right. You have my permission. But you have to do something for me. Find that woman who has just fled to the river thirty miles away by the dead woods. By any means possible, try to follow her into Longmen Town. You go alone. Could I stay and let the two of them go? I said you go alone. It's all right. Boss. Go. Seven days. You have seven days. Don't forget. Your brothers are waiting for you. When you find it, launch the signal flare. And I'll be able to locate you based on where the fireworks appear. Absolutely. I can't wait to see him kill you with his own hands. Come on. Sit here. I'm going to deliver it to them first, all right? Go. The eldest son of the He family in Guanxi, He Sheng. Is this place Longmen Town, for real? Of course, it is. Do you know the rules for getting into Longmen? Never leave this place unless Rakshasa is down. You are the Life-taking Judge Wu Shengru, aren't you? You spread the news saying Longmen Town was founded by Sword Immortal Wolong. May I see him? I'm afraid the answer is no. Why? I'm afraid the dead will stain his eyes. When you went in, you kept checking where the doors and windows are. You were trying to figure out how to escape, weren't you? The desert is dry and hot. Coming all the way here, a normal person would have been thirsty. You have chapped lips but you didn't drink the tea handed by Cripple. You must be on your guard. It's the first time I'm here, I have no choice but to beware. You made your point. I can see that your right hand is calloused. You must be used to practicing material arts with it. But you need to know He Sheng is left-handed. The last thing you should do is pretend to be my foster son. The third son of the He family, my blood brother, He Chen. He has two wives and sixteen servants. Rakshasa dog, here is your bill. Cripple, hurry and tidy up. Don't mess up my floor. Here we go again. Lunatic. Ever since Xiaoman left, she's been torturing us every day to the point we couldn't sleep properly. It's been hours, there's no one here. Spare my life, I just couldn't stand injustice. Don't worry, I closed my eyes. I saw nothing the whole time. You are injured and poisoned very badly. Human life is beyond value, right? Sorry for being rude. This is for you. There's some left. How do you know it's poisonous? I... The smell of blood. You do know how to choose a place. The wind is blowing towards me. Can I give you a suggestion? Just put your mind on, well, on something important, and wait for that hunger to pass. It will less hungry that way. Do you usually suffer from hunger? Yes. But I can always find a way to get something to eat. When I was a kid, I used to steal some stuff, you know, for food. I got beaten up a lot, too. Right. That herbal medicine you used was something I figured out myself after being beaten too much. I am Wei Pingan. It means when the food is in the stomach, all is well. A cultural name, isn't it? What's your name? Luo Xiaoman. Well, now the world is in chaos. I heard that there is Longmen Town or whatever it's called, but they say it's an imaginary land of joy and plenty. An imaginary land of joy and plenty? It's just a prison for dragging out an ignoble existence. Never mind. It would be nice to have food and shelter and not get beat up. Longmen Town Inn, do You know where it is? Then, can you take me there, warrior? I saved your life twice already. Longmen Town only accepts those who hate to live together under the same sky with the Rakshasa Sect. That's me, I hate to live together under the same sky with the Rakshasa Sect. Let me tell you this, I grew up with no parents, and I always thought these guys from the Rakshasa Sect were the ones to blame. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. I hate to live together under the same sky with the Rakshasa Sect. You... Why do you ignore me? You... I don't care. I... I... If you don't take me there, I'll keep whining at you anyway. Sleep. The good are protected by Heaven. Eldest Young Master will be safe. How about that good-for-nothing brat? Fifty strokes of the whip knocked him out. After going there in person, he let them flee after all. Useless. Never mind. I suppose he must have learned his lesson. Forget the rest, let him be grounded and ponder upon his faults. Master absolves you of punishment and commanded you to stay in your room and ponder upon your faults. I am sorry. The poison I sucked out of you yesterday, it seems that I didn't spit it out completely. He saved my life. Ghost Doctor saved his life already. Longmen has its rules. At the most, let him go, then. Kill him after saving him, what's the point? I said he got poisoned because of you, that's why we saved him. But killing him is the rule of Longmen. He is just a punk who doesn't even know martial arts. There is no way he is a member of the Rakshasa Sect. Why can't we spare his life? What if we do that and he turns out to be a spy of the Rakshasa Sect? Will they spare our lives? Sweetheart, you must know that your mother has to consider the lives of all. I don't care. If you lay a finger on him, I'll never forgive you as long as I live. Fine. Let's do what we always do, then. The Judge will decide his life and death. Someone wants to see you. Wash your face and go downstairs. Sit properly. He got jumpy. Why did you put that cup of tea down when it's already near your mouth? It was difficult for me to get water when I was a kid so I didn't want to drink more when I've just had it. When was the last time you drink water? Just now. I was given a whole basin of water. Is it interesting? Let's assume what you are saying is true. The world knows our Longmen Town only kills people from the Rakshasa Sect. Just now, why were you so afraid of being found out? Was I afraid? This brat will be dead meat for sure. When you look out the door... If you kill him, I will hate you for the rest of my life. I... Your hands are fair and clean. If I'm not mistaken, you are a master of the internal force. I'll come clean. I am a master of the internal force in my dream. I... I've never had certain jobs. As a matter of course, my hands are fair and soft, man. Such a glib tongue you have. Even if you don't know material arts, you still have sinister motives. Whether you are a member of the Rakshasa Sect or not, I, Wu, don't want to rely on sheer good luck. Kiddo, pay your bill, then. What bill? I didn't order tea, you gave it to me at your will. Uncle Wu. Cripple, go to town and get the others back. Oh. Can I go now? Go back to your room and have a rest, for now. Sure, sure, sure, sure. Well, then, you all just talk among yourselves. Damn. Where is my signal flare? Where is it? Don't tell me they hid it from me? You two have to hang in there for me. Did you fall for him? No. You can't keep it from me. I don't want you to go through what I did. I will never fall in love with any man in my life. I just want to return the favor. Let him go. Cover his eyes and let him go. Even if I agree to let him go, others will be determined to kill him. It's about the secret and safety of Longmen Town. I don't care. Where is the signal flare? If I can't find that signal flare, how on earth could I leave? I have to think of something. These are rations and travel expenses. I will get you out of Longmen. We're even from now on. Hey, can I stay? Then you will die. Can I neither go nor die? No. Go with me at dawn. No room for discussion? Yueniang can't show up. We will follow them later. As soon as Xiaoman disjoin that brat, we will make our moves. Longmen Town doesn't allow outsiders to come in and get out alive. Get on. I don't want to go. You'll die if you don't. Die... Then I will die. There's something more important in Longmen Town than my life. I can't go. Longmen Town has your stuff? You are babbling insanely. I save you because you did the same thing to me. You're healed now, get lost. Or else I won't care whether you are dead or alive. That day, when we were underwater, although I saved you in a moment of desperation, it was the first time ever in my life that a girl and I... Luo Xiaoman, I... I fell in love with you. Anyway, I don't care. I'm not going, even if I die. It was joyful when we were together. It was bitter when we separated. There are many more infatuated men and women in the world. Xiaoman. I finally waited until you came back. Suit yourself. Xiaoman. Xiaoman. Xiaoman. Xiaoman. Luo Yueniang, Heaven and earth can be the witnesses of what I just said. I hope you can allow me to stay here. There is no room for useless people in Longmen Town. Who says I'm useless? I can do all kinds of dirty and exhausting tasks. As long as I can stay with Xiaoman, I'll do anything. I'm definitely not leaving anyway. Fine. Fine. Why hasn't he come out yet? Shengnan, go back and see what's going on with me. Yes. Cripple, stay here and watch closely. Remember, don't go anywhere until we get back. Sit here absolutely still. Let's go. Let's go. I got it. Kill him. But Xiaoman will keep his life for sure. Get him out of Longmen and kill him outside. But didn't he say he wouldn't go even if he died? Then what should we do? Men's words... All right. From tomorrow on, don't give him a slight moment of comfort. I don't believe he's not going. Old man, get up, get up, get up. It's dark, we're closed. Go home and sleep. You, you, you... Who let you bother him? Get back here. Odd. From now on, that old man can do whatever he wants. Don't bother him. Who, who has told me that? Huh? If you want to get rid of me, just say it, what are those excuses for? It's been a whole day. You want to pick on me? I will take it all. Whatever tricks you have, bring it on. I'd rather be a hammer if I'm afraid of you. If only I'd known material arts, I would kick your ass. Then do you want to learn some? You startled me. I'm in a bad mood, don't bother me. If you want to learn, meet me in town two miles north. Pretending to be a master while wearing those? I don't know what I can learn from you. This brat has no intention of leaving. Be harder on him tomorrow. That damn man. He dares to chase the same girl as I do. I'm going to let him learn his lesson a hard way. Duo. You, too. Bother Xiaoman again, and I'll cut you into pieces. Cripple has been gone all day, where the hell is he? Oops, I forgot about him. Damn. Pretty boy, your mistake was chasing the same girl as I do. It's your blessing to die in my hands. On the road to the underworld, remember my name. I am Swordsman Duoqing. Show me some respect, would you? You kept me waiting for so long. Old man. Old man. Old man. Old man. My stuff, give it to me. That Blood-Reversing Manual relies on your life to push your potential. Once your potential is pushed, your internal force will reduce. It's not worth it. Young Master. We can let him fight Wolong to death... Check what's on there. Hongxiu is just concerned about... Get a clear understanding of your place. You're just one of the servants I rescued. You have no right to interfere with what I do. Give it to me. I found out that there is an apothecary in Sangcheng. In fact, that apothecary is an outpost set up by Longmen Town. They provide supplies to Longmen and lead the way to outsiders to go there. Spread the news that the Rakshasa is coming. I want the Rakshasa to arrive in Longmen with no risk at all. That's all I can do. Xue. Kiddo. What is this? The rest is on this map. This old man has nothing left to teach you. Old man. Old man. Old man. After waiting for so long, I finally got you. Let's have a duel. Are you talking to me? When I knew what Xiaoman had suffered, I was heart-wretched. To save you, with a hemp rope, a wooden plank, I don't know how long did it take for a fragile girl like her to drag you back and saved you that made her hands all mangled. Every time I think about it, my heart aches so much that I can't breathe. Today, I want you to pay for the hardships Xiaoman suffered with your blood. So that's how she took me back? Thanks. Let me see your hands. Why do you hate it that much? Do you think I wouldn't know as long as you keep it from me? But it's so kind and righteous of you to fight so hard for someone you barely know. You saved me, I saved you. That's all. I, Wei Pingan, said I was a man who returns the favor. Tell me, what do you want? I will get it for you. The stars overhead. Can you get them? As long as it's not money. Stars? I'll give them to you. Are you sure those are Wolong's sword skills? I am, those are Wolong's sword skills. Or else, I, Duoqing... That explains why. A few days ago, that boy didn't know material arts. After one night, he made a thoroughgoing change. It must be, it must be him who taught that boy. Then this boy is absolutely untouchable. Why can he be untouchable? There are so many of us. If that's the case, this boy is much appreciated by him. So what? We can... Judging from what we saw the other day, he didn't know material arts. Maybe he's not a member of the Rakshasa Sect. Xiaoman. Can I come in? No. Tell me, do you really fall hard for Wei Pingan? I told you before. That's not the truth, I can tell. Just so you know, I've decided to accept him. But there were intimate relations between you two. We can't just let it go easily. If you like him, I will let him marry you, all right? I don't like him. I'm going to bed. It's all my fault. I left some stuff for you by the door. I won't bother you anymore. I told you I was going to bed. Don't. I've been busy all night. If you're asleep now, all my work will be for nothing. Don't just stand there. Let's go. I'm taking you to watch the stars. Where are the stars? Close your eyes. Hurry and close your eyes. Open your eyes. In all the years I've been here, I've never had such good food. And you guys are all over him today. Can't you stop being so petty? Give us a hand. Hey, Wu, try this ginger soup to see whether is good. - Come on, come on. - I think it's good. Right? My God, it's not sweet enough. Do you want to add some ginger powder? This is flour. Take it away quickly. Put it down. Why are you petty again? You don't help anything at all. I told you to put it down because it needs to be cooled down. It's so hot that if you give it to him, it will burn him to death right away. Pingan. Come. Sit here. Sit down, sit down. Sit down. In this place, every time a new member joins Longmen, we will hold a welcome party to that one. You are the star today. Me? Yeah. Ruling out the possibility that you're a member of the Rakshasa Sect, we decided to admit you into Longmen Town. Once you're with us, we will live and die together. Everyone here is all alone with no friends or relatives, so we all think of each other as family. And from now on, so will you. You are at the same age as our Xiaoman. Everyone will treat you like a nephew of theirs. Why don't you wear the clothes I gave you? It's not fit? It fits. I haven't worn any new clothes. Wearing these clothes, I've got the feeling that one arm is longer than the other. Aren't clothes always worn from new to old? Were your clothes old since the beginning? My clothes were old, to begin with. I ripped them off a dead man. It's better than when I was wearing nothing. The clothes Shengnan gave you were actually made for her brother. But she never got a chance to send it. Which one in Longmen Town doesn't hold a grudge in mind? It's all because of the Rakshasa Sect. Shengru, the descendant of Judge Wu in Guanxi, had wounded a few members of the Rakshasa Sect because he couldn't stand the sight of injustice, that Rakshasa Sect took revenge on him. Shengru was the only one who escaped from the Wu family. Shengnan and her younger brother grew up keeping each other company. Because Mister Ghost wanted to find those who were born in Yin hours to create venomous insects, Shengnan watched her brother die tragically. Here. Let's have a toast. For our new member in Longmen Town, for our Longmen Town having more strength to fight against Rakshasa. Bottoms up. Come on, bottoms up. It's too late. After all this time, I finally found someone like you. After a while, I thought she was you. I know. It's just a new guy coming in. Show yourself. Pretty girl. Your outfit and weapon. If I'm not mistaken, you must be a rising star of the Rakshasa Sect. You're that crazy woman, Mo Luo. It's Crazy Dog Mo Luo. I want you to know my name, too. I am Duoqing... I Have no interest in knowing a dead man's name. I'll get someone else to drink with me. Will you? Finding someone else to drink with? Come on, I'll drink with you. Cheers. We could often hear her sobbing in her room in the town. It was a terrible death for her brother. Come on, brother. Sister. You still need to remember my name. The Sword Saint of Nanjiang and the most handsome man of Jiangnan, Swordsman Duoqing with a heartless sword. Seven days. We were late. This is Zhao's niece. She survived by hiding in the haystack of the stable. It's only seven days. It's not like we are close to each other already. A piece of clothing and a meal... Do I have to appreciate them? They are neither relatives nor friends. Why should I care about their lives? Song and Dao have been with me for so many years. Their lives are more important, obviously. Where is the signal flare? Quit waiting. Your husband sold you out for a chance to live. Xiaoman. Luo Xiaoman. Go with me, hurry up. Where are we going? It's so far. We're running out of Longmen Town. Don't ask too much, just go with me. Where are going? Why makes it so mysterious? In brief, it will be a surprise. Is it your plan? When you fainted the other day, I saw the firework flare in your arms. Do you really like me? Wei Pingan. This is probably the only chance in my life to trust a man. The dog is coming. I've had enough of hiding for years. We meet again after all. I've waited a long time for this day. I owe them a debt of gratitude, I must protect them. Let them go. And you can take my life. You should have died in my hands. You don't have bargaining counters to talk to me. You will have to die with them. Haotian, it was an accident. That year, I was surrounded by various sects, I have never expected she would rush in. She was worried about your safety and was trying to talk you out of the final battle. But you were out of your mind because of killing. You sent my son back to me with false pretenses and then snatch him away from me. That year it was me who asked Yanzhi to be returned, what reason did I have to snatch him away? Reasons? You hated that Xue married me. You were jealous of me because Xue gave birth to Yanzhi. To torture me, when I was off my guard, you stole my son. My second son, Wuji, saw it with his own eyes. Have you ever told Wuji about my appearance? You have no shame. At the last moment, to save your life, you even try to pass the buck to a kid? Today, you will pay your life for Xue. As for Yanzhi, I will look for him by myself. I deserve to die. The clothes Shengnan gave you were actually made for her brother. Run. Take Xiaoman with you. Hurry. Hurry and run. Never, ever coming back. Run. Have you found Yanzhi? They are all the wrong age. Their bodies are also checked. No snowflake birthmark on the left shoulder was found. Brat, you're digging your own grave. I arranged for you and your father to meet here so that you could kill him yourself. But this sword, why can't you, why can't you stab through him? I said I didn't need you to get involved with my business. Get lost. Don't. That Blood-Reversing Manual relies on your life to push your potential. Once your potential is pushed, your internal force will reduce. It's not worth it. Brother. Looking at how painful you are, I am so happy. Do you know how I've felt all these years? No, you don't know. Our father has two sons, but there seems to be only one for him. Your mother died, and he missed her all his life. What about my mother? She was just a stepping stone to Central Mainland to seek your mother's revenge. When my mother passed away, he didn't even shed a tear. None of you think of me as family. I have pushed you off the cliff. Why... Why am I still me when you're gone? If I can't change anything, then I don't need to do so. I need nothing now. Old man, why are there just two words for the last move? What does "let go" mean? I can't teach you the last move. You have to figure it out by yourself. Now, with my own hands, I will send you to hell. Aren't you tired, little brother? None of your business. Why don't you kill me? Aren't you tired of living like this? You don't understand a thing. Although I can't kill you, I'll make you regret it for the rest of your life. A generation of gratitude or resentment ended. The living may suffer more. In the long years to come, there are only loneliness and redemption. This is karma, and this is the world. Longmen Town Inn. Waiter, we two brothers are hunted down by our enemies and came here by chance. Excuse me, is this the rumored Longmen Town Inn founded by Sword Immortal Wolong? Exactly. Oh my, Cripple. Stop sweeping the floor in the morning and help them out. Come on, come on. Xiaoman. I wrote a new poem for you, Xiaoman. Stop calling her, stop calling her. Let's eat! Stop calling her. It was joyful when we were together. It was bitter when we separated. There are many more infatuated men and women in the world. Bring me another bowl, Cripple. Xiaoman, let's eat. Wu, the duster cloth. Xiaoman, let's eat. A duster cloth. I told you to bring me more bowls. Let's have the meal together, Xiaoman. Bring it over here. Come, come, Pingan. Let's eat, let's eat. Why are you just standing here? Help us out. Braised fish in brown sauce. Here, Cripple. Yueniang. Your liquor for today. Pour some. Come on, there will be one more pair of chopsticks from now on. Brother Duo. If Xiaoman doesn't eat, neither do I. Don't eat, then. Drink some. I won't drink until there's something left from Xiaoman. Come on. All right. Wu. It's mealtime, stop doing accounts. All right. Let's eat, let's eat. Come on. Hurry and try braised fish in brown sauce. Longmen Town Inn was founded by Sword Immortal Wolong. The night is cold. Waiting for you to turn around. Why can't I catch up on the innocence of your smile? I kept asking again and again how much you love me. Mottled scars are still sinking in the past life. Holding the candle, who is waiting for the beauty to turn around. Wandering under the tree, who asked the world of mortals how to forget the scenes when I was with you. I am too drunk and have an illusion that you are in front of me now. If we had never met, would it be rewritten? In the end, you and I still live on both sides of the world.
