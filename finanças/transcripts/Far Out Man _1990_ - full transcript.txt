Hey, wake up, asshole. My father wrote this song 10 years ago, remember? Yeah, it's really good. It's going to be in a Blimpie commercial. You watch TV, don't' you? No, no. Casanova out your call. Yeah, we say I'm a real crowd pleaser. Good times are guaranteed for all. I got Nasty Habits. I keep bad company. If there's something I want I just grab it. You know, he's driving me crazy. He's been showing up at my set every day. Well, what do you mean? Well, I figured I would partial in the slave class. So he's been coming on the set and ruining everything. We're over scheduled, we're over budgeted. It's horrible. If its' a good time, that's all right though. Honey, I'm the man to call. I got nasty habits. I keep bad company. If there's something I want, I just grab it. He says he's looking for his girlfriend but she left him 10 years ago. Then that would have to be your mother. Oh, no. She left him 20 years ago. What's he doing now, I mean besides driving you nuts. Nothing. Nothing? He owns all this land as far as you can see. Well then, I think I'm going to be able to help him out with his problems and if he's as rich as you say he is he can help me out with mine. It's going to work out very well, I think. How did he get so rich? He got lucky. He was out looking for his girlfriend one night and he got hit by a Rolls Royce. He was so stoned, he didn't feel a thing. But he got tons of money because they thought he suffered brain damage. Good guess. Why are we stopping? We'd better put our seat belts on. Why is that? My father says the best way to take this next part, is to get it over with fast. Oh my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh! company. If there's something I want, I just grab it. Honey, I don't set rules. Yeah, I've got nasty habits. I keep bad company. If there's something I Oh, slow down. Just slow down a little bit, please. Whoa! What is this? Hands up there! Oh, my God. I've got nasty habits. I got more than I need. Nasty habits. Oh, whew. Well, we made it. If I could puke, I'd feel better. I just have a thing against puking. Ah! That was something, huh? Oh,-- - Just get my bag. I forgot to tell you something. Yeah. My dad's got weird eating habits. So don't take food if he offers it to you. He's a gourmet? You'll see. Dad! Dad! Dad! Hi! Hi, honey! I have someone here I want you to meet. What? He's here to help you. I want you to meet a friend of mine. Huh? Could you turn the music down? Huh? I can't hear you because of the music it's... I can't hear you. I have to turn the music down. OK, OK. Hey! Hey! Charlie! Charlie! Thank you. Aw, man that's the first time we came in together. This is Dr. Liddledick. Little what? Um, dick. But it's pronounced "Lie-del" dick. Well, nice to meet you, Mr. Liddledick. Um, you know, I'm going to go after rehearsal. Oh honey. Honey, where you rehearsing? I'll come and see you. Uh, I don't know. But I'm late so. Well, how am I supposed to get back to town? Oh he'll give you a ride. Thank you, darling. OK. Bye. Liddledick, huh? Well, at least you got one. Yeah, when the skipper, you know, he got mad at Gilligan, remember that? Oh, that's fine. Excuse me? Do you know where the principal is? Excuse me? Tree, did we have an appointment? You know how I am about time. Well, you wanted to see me about my son. Oh, Kyle. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to take Kyle out of school Out of school? Well, that's a bummer. Here at New Age High School, we have only two rules: no book reading and no homework. And Kyle has broken both of them. Double bummer. He just doesn't seem to understand our television technique. The children sit in front of the television sets and watch "Gilligan's Island." Afterwards, we have a little discussion of the hidden meanings and life lessons. Everybody is very happy except for Kyle. Oh, he's so weird. And I think Kyle needs therapy. Therapy? Rock and roll therapy. Have you ever heard of "The Farts"? "The Farts?" Well, "The Farts" are the loudest rock and role group in the world. I have tickets for their next concert. Perhaps if you and the boys father were to take Kyle. His father? I haven't seen his father in 10 years. Have you ever been hypnotized before Mr. Man? Uh, hypnotized? Yeah. Is that like-- Well, you know, I was in jail once. And these guys tried, you know, No, no, no. That's completely different. And this is painless. Well, that's what they said, man. It's painless and drug free. Oh, bummer. OK, now watch this very closely. You're getting sleepy. Very sleepy. You will like this film. You will tell a friend. Now, I want you to go back in time. Way back, further, further. No, no, no, not that far back. Very sleepy. Good. OK, now, Mr. Man. I'm going to say a word, I want you to give me the first word that comes into your mind. Pussy. No, we haven't started yet. First word will be, dog. Tree. Tree. OK, that's excellent. The next word is, salami. Tree. OK, that's good. Oh, Jesus! Ouch. - Tree. - Shit. Tree. No, no, we are just about-- Tree. Tree. This-- exactly what kind of tree is this that we're talking about? Blonde. Blue eyes. Nice personality. So this tree is a woman. Is this-- is this your woman? She left me. She left me and took my baby. Took everything. Took her Joni Mitchell record and she split, man. Why did she leave you? Now, think back. Said she couldn't sing, man. Oh boy, she couldn't sing. Whoa. It's a big hassle, man. I'm a black man. I'm a black man. I'm a militant black, man. I'm a militant black man. I'm a kill you, black man. I'm a kill you black man. Hey, man. Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it. Hey, man. Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it. Hey man. Hold it, hold it. Hey man. Hey man. Hold it, hold it. Wait man, wait. Wait, hold it, hold it. Come here, let me talk to you, come here. Just hold on for a minute. Come here. Told you before, man. The woman can't sing, boy. You got to get rid of her, Jack. We have work to do. And I ain't-- got to get rid of her. What are you talking about, man? I'm talking about my blue booty, boy. You got to get rid of her. You understand what I mean? I mean, she can't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow, man. You know what I mean? Get with-- Go on, you tell her now, man. You told me you were going to tell her before. I told you she couldn't sing. Got them-- I'll think of something. That was so groovy. Oh! Bunny, let's do it again. Ah! Come on, Bunny I'm still horny. Let's get it on, again. I'm still horny. Oh, shit I'm late. Look at the time, man. Oh, I got to go. I'm late. Oh damn. What do you mean, you're late? I got to rehearsal, man. Oh! We've got a rehearsal? Oh, honey. Why didn't you tell me? I've gt to get ready. I've got to get a babysitter. Ah, you don't need a babysitter, man. Yeah, cool. I'll just bring him with me. Ah, you don't need to come, man, you're not in the band anymore. What do you mean, I'm not in the band? Well, - We had a meeting, man. And we decided it'd be better if you were out of the band until we got a record contract, man. Then after that, it'll be cool. You can come on the road with us, man, and sing. You know? Just like before, with the mic off and everything, you know? With the mic off? Yeah, except for the other day, man. Someone left your mic on by mistake, man. Wow. We-- we couldn't figure out where that sound is coming from, man. I thought I blew a speaker or something. Oh, Christ. I got to pick up that girl, too. Yeah, Bobby met this chick, man. She's a topless dancer but she sings her ass off, man. She looks great. And I got to go pick her up, man. So how do I look? Huh? I don't know about this outfit, man. Do you-- Do you think it's cool enough? You know, I think I'm ready for a new look. What do you think? Hey! What are you doing, man? She cut all the patches off my jeans, man, and left me. And took the kid and the patches with her. OK. Let's go back to the very, very beginning with you and this, this Tree. When did you meet her? Think back, now. What do you see? Salad. Whoa. Lettuce, tomato, salad oil. Salami, strawberries, pasquedos. Yeah. Squishy stuff. More squishy stuff. Sourdough bread and Mexican busboys. White people, Iranian cashiers and oh, waitresses with nice titties. Oh, sorry, man. That's all right. I'll get it, Mr. Man. How's the breakfast, man? I'm sorry. It's a little rubbery. I'm sorry. Hey, I'll make you pancakes-- No, no, no. That's all right. Let's just get on with your therapy. After your wife and child left you, then what did you do? I started Hippyland, man. When my woman left, I had a brilliant flash I started Hippyland, man, just to raise some cash. I wanted it to be just like Disneyland, man. For all the hippy dippy people right across this land. With a big bong ride that would suck you inside. Spin you round and round while everybody got down. Making love, not war 'til their bodies got sore. Then you work out all your cramps in the lava lamps. But the baddest ride of all would be The Free Fall Balls that take you way up in the sky. Groovy way to get high. But first you stand in line for this real fun time and you better not cry when it's your turn to fly. And don't look down when you're way up off the ground. Oop, I changed my mind, I don't want to go. Hey, wait a minute bro. Can we take this slow? Say fool, oh, lord, look out below. Hey, it's OK. Now, don't run away because the next ride you take will be a piece of cake. And you don't have to stand for what we've got planned. This is going to be fun, unless you're too dumb to come. Just hang on tight and we will make it all right. Now, blast off time for a real space flight. And don't get sick inside this dick. We'll spin you round and round way above the ground. Are we having fun? Rides almost done. Look out below, I think I'm going to come. Things are going fine I was building the ride when old Bobby came by and somehow snuck inside. I didn't know he was there 'til I raised him in the air. He was screaming so loud, I didn't know what was the matter 'til I saw him hanging there and I ran and got a ladder. While I was getting him down, I gave the balls a little touch and Bobby took off. He didn't like it very much. Hey man what are you doing? Nose bleeds when I'm in an elevator. Don't worry about it, man. I'll fix it I just gotta get a ladder. I'll be right up. Don't go away, OK? Get me down, fool. Get me down. Hey listen, man. The truck's stuck in the up position. But don't worry, man. I'll have you down before you know it. The operating modes of the sweep delayer indicated by the LED lamp located at the right of the delay slighting switch. The switch intersects the light... OK. OK, I want you try this on. - Testing one, two-- - No, no, no. It goes right on your head. There you go. OK. What kind of tape recorder is this? No, it's not a tape recorder. What I want to do is I'm going to be testing your brain waves. You're not a reporter? No, no, no. I'm a psychiatrist. Oh, I thought you were a reporter from "High Times," man. No. Been waiting for my little gift. Well, that's funny. Let me see something. Just for a second here. Yeah, well it's not the hat. Let me try this. Try it again. Amazing. Just amazing. Well, according to your brainwave charts, your solution is pretty darn simple. You need a job. A blow job? No, no, no, no. Money. - Sure, I'll pay, man. - No, no, no. You see, you're getting way off the track here. What you need is some sort of occupation that can just get your mind right off that Tree. - Who? - Tree. Your woman. You remember, the one you're trying to forget? Yeah right. According to this, you are actually well-suited for four different occupations. I have to tell you, though, that you didn't test too high on the chart here. You're somewhere between plankton and toaster. But that still leaves four jobs open for you. Either politician, lawyer, boat anchor, or roadie. I'm a roadie, man. I really am. I got a truck and everything. Well, splendid. Then when I snap my fingers, you'll be a roadie. You'll be back on the road again. Forgetting all about this Tree business. And write me a check for $10,000. Cool. You know what? Come to think of it, make it for 20. Because after all, I did make a house call. Which reminds me, I have to be in Torrance in an hour. So why don't you call me a cab? Sorry. Hey, you're a cab. I'm a roadie. I have to been in Torrance in an hour. Excuse me, man. Just a minute. Let me plug that one in. OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's got a short in it, man. I've got to get this thing fixed. Gotta be in Torrance in an hour, man. What about my check? Oh yeah, your check. And you're a cab. Thank you. 20. $20.00! - OK, Bill. This is our last supper for a while, man. Because I'm on the road. Here you are. Seems I forgot which one's yours. Well, here. You choose. Oh, man. Well, I'm hungry, Bill. Yum. I think you're fooling me, Bill. Yum. Hmm. Honey. Kyle. Always reading. It's not healthy. That's why you're having so much trouble in school. Mom, that school sucks. The Principal's a kook. C. Thomas puts out a lot of money for that school. So, he's a kook, too. C. Thomas is a kook? How dare you talk about him like that. If it wasn't for C. Thomas, we wouldn't have all of this. He takes good care of us. Come on, honey. You just got to make more of an effort. Watch more TV. When I was your age that's all I did, was watch TV and listen to music. Mom, I do listen to music. Yeah, but what kind of music? Beethoven? So, I like Beethoven. Well, tonight we're going to go see "The Farts." So come on, honey. Get ready. Oh baby, are you dirty! Oh! I missed you. Hey, we're back on the road, though. Oh, wow , a roach. Hey! I'll save this for later. OK, are you going to start for me or what? Check this out, man. Dude calls up Keith and says he wants me to come in and audition. You know, what does he think, I'm Rob Lowe or something? You know, I'm a professional, man. I know I get offers on films. You know, I don't read for nobody. I'm C. Thomas Howell. I don't need this. I'll go do a film in the Mediterranean, with Franco Zepherelli. With my fine babe and my kid here, man. That's what I'll do. Thank you very much. - Torrance, man. Where the hell's Torrance? Torrance. I better look at a map. OK. Torrance. Torrance. Well, here's Venice. I'd better go ask that dude. Hey, excuse me, man. Hey, is this Tampa City or Almani, man? I can't figure this map out. Where you want to go? I have to be in Torrance in an hour. Hey, tell you what, man. You help me start the car, I'll take you there. What's wrong with it, man? I don't know, it's my cousin, Julio's. He;s getting married, man. I'm late, too. I think I've got. Yeah, start it up. Yeah, hey start it, man. All right. Go for it. Go for it, man. Hey, hold it, man. Stop guy. Stop, stop, stop. All right. Por que, man. I'll follow you. I ought to kill you, son of a bitch. Crazy hippy. Oh, shit. My nylon's come undone. C. Thomas, wait. Hey, Kyle, you gotten laid yet? You're so mean to me. I'm trying to help the guy out. Give him a break. Only the best, now. Look, look, grab a couple of beers and meet us in the back. Track him down. Like bursting out of the dark. Come on.

And somehow I ended up in Almani. So then I asked directions, you know? And then I ended up in Wilmington, man. And I asked directions again and I ended up in Compton. I didn't ask anybody there, man. I just drove out of Compton and ended up in Pasadena. And finally found a hitchhiker, man. And they were coming here, so I ended up here, man. I'm sorry I'm late, man. Where's Dave? Uh, Dave's not here, man. I can see, Dave's not here. But where is he? He's sick. he's sick. Sick my dick He's probably somewhere fucked up.

Hippie children love is everywhere. Hippy children come on. Hippy children all over this world there are young boys and girls taking care of their mothers. From every junior high, all the holes in the sky young girls are thinking. And out of this foolish vacation from learning come new hippy nations. Peace and love little girls talk about ecology and working together. Inner city college kids thinking about someone besides themselves. But now hippy children, they're everywhere. Hippy children love everywhere. Hippy children come on, come on, come on. Hippy children come on yeah. Now is the time for all the hippies to come to the aid of the planet. And the only pragmatic solutions are dreams about love. Hippy children they're everywhere.
