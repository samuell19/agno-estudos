(melancholy music) (fire crackling) - Some years ago on a beautiful evening in the month of April I was riding along a tree-bordered road on my way home from a long day of partridge shooting. When I saw the solitary figure of a lad who was walking slowly along the road about 100 yards ahead of me. As I was on horseback, I soon overtook the boy and was about to pass him when he spoke to me. - Sir, could you tell me the time please? - It's almost six o'clock. You seem tired. - I'm very tired. I've walked 15 miles today. - That is a long walk. How old are you? - I'm 16, sir. I'm stronger than I look. - Well in any case you can't go much further this evening. What are you gonna do about food? Where are you going to sleep? - I have a little money. I shall buy some bread and cheese and sleep in a haystack as I did last night. - Have you run away from school? Don't you think your parents will be worried? - I don't have any parents, sir, and I haven't run away from school. - Or some other relative or a friend. - I have neither relative nor friend in the whole world. - Well you better come along with me. Perhaps my housekeeper will find you something to eat and a bed for the night. - Well after my mother died, my father was a mining engineer and sadly he was killed in an accident in Canada two years ago. I was sent to a school in London where I stayed until about six months ago. And then some people came to take me away from school, of whom I don't wish to speak. They were not kind to me because I wouldn't do what they wished. So I left their house. - I knew instinctively that Frank had not told me the whole truth. But there was something about the boy I liked and I felt sorry for him. (clock chimes) I suggest you go to bed now. In the morning we will talk again. Perhaps, Frank, you could stay here a while. You know I have a feeling there's probably a better future for you here than at sea. - Oh sir, could I really stay here? I'd be so happy. - We'll see in the morning. For the time being, off to bed with you. - Oh yes sir. - [Woman] Come on, my lad. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight, Frank. - And thank you. - Please. - [Man] I was still puzzled but in a strange way excited. Though for the life of me I wasn't sure why. - Goodnight, my boy. - Goodnight. (clock chimes) - [Man] A batchelor such as I with neither parents and who lives alone is much dependent upon his servants. My butler, Watson, who had known me since my childhood, ran the household and was rarely at the loss for a solution to any problem. He had found among my boyhood possessions a suit which fitted young Frank admirably. Frank had already made friends with some of the other servants who were taken with his good manners and cheerful disposition. (clock chimes) I resolved he should continue his education and found myself acting as tutor and guide. I was starting to form an estimate of the boy's character and temperament. He was truthful and very affectionate. (thoughtful music) But he still continued to puzzle me. He would never accompany me out shooting. He said he couldn't bear to see the birds killed. It was strange that a boy who had pluck enough to run away to sea would have shrunk from seeing a partridge shot. Of course he wasn't thoughtless. He had a hasty temper and liked having his own way. And he was at times liable to treat the servants, particularly the female ones in a contemptuous way. Though I believe I have a kindly nature, but there are times when the exercise of a little discipline is unavoidable. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Watson. - Oh sir, sir! - [Man] What's the trouble? - It's Mr. Frank. He was in the pantry. He had no business to be there. Oh let alone eating jam. One of the maids told him to leave it. He hit her. - And where is Mr. Frank now? - [Maid] He ran away. God knows where he is. - I see. Watson, do you remember the canings the old man would administer when I misbehaved? - Yes sir. - How he's stomp around, swishing it this way and that way? He had me absolutely terrified before he even started. - Ah, those were the good old days, if you don't mind me saying so. - You think the old chastiser is still about? - [Watson] No doubt. - Well fetch it. There's a good fellow. This situation calls for six of the best. My library contained a number of rare volumes which I kept under lock and key. Profusely illustrated they were in their way classics of erotica. Although strictly forbidden, Frank had taken advantage of my absence to further, if illicitly, advance his education. (giggling) - Oh. (whip cracks) - So Frank, this is how you pass your time whilst I'm away. Have you anything to say for yourself now? - I am ashamed and sorry for what I've done. - Let down your trousers. - [Frank] Oh please. Not on my bare bottom. - You've behaved disgracefully and I'm going to punish you. - Please, please sir. Don't beat me. - [Man] You think you're the first to have thought of that? On the bare bottom. Bend over the stool. - I know I deserve to be punished sir, but please don't beat me. - Let down your trousers at once. I didn't think you were a coward. As this might be the last lesson I gave young Frank before turning him over to the harsher realities of an English boarding school, I resolved to give him a beating he would not easily forget. (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) (whip cracking) (grunts) I saw it. - [Frank] May I go, sir. - And everything was clear. Yes, go. All the mystery of the past few months was solved. Frank was a girl. What was I to do? Clearly my plan to send Frank, although Frances would be more appropriate, to send her to boarding school was no longer possible or practical. (thoughtful music) Should I keep her at Oakhurst? The more I thought about it the more outrageous and attractive the whole idea became. And if I kept the secret, who would know? The idea of having a young female disguised as a boy as my protege and ward became positively exciting. That evening I dined alone. Or so I thought. Until unexpectedly Frank or Frances made her appearance. She took her place at the table and seated herself not without some difficulty. I discreetly observed her as if for the first time. She certainly was very pretty. And if her golden hair had been long, and she had been dressed in the garments of her sex, she would've been irresistible. I resolved to play the game according to the rules Frances herself had made. And continued to treat her as a boy. So Frank, I hope the lesson struck home. - Oh yes sir. - Is your bottom still sore? - Very. Sir? - [Man] Yes? - Do you think that girls are often caned? - Why that's a strange question. And I shall think the answer probably is not as often as they deserve. But many a girl does get birched by her mother or her governess. - Did you ever know of a girl being caned by a man? - I've absolutely no doubt that some fathers do cane their daughters. I have no personal knowledge. Why do you ask? - Oh I was just curious, sir. - Frank, I've decided to be lenient with you. I was planning to send you away to school. But I've changed my mind. I think it would be better for all concerned if you remain here at Oakhurst. - Oh thank you, sir. (exclaims) (happy music) - A few weeks later I had occasion to make one of my periodic visits to London. Whilst I normally stayed at my London club, I also maintain a villa in Maida Vale. My destination was the villa and its present resident. An accommodating young lady known as Maud. (bright music) (Maud moans) Step. - [Maud] Oh, thank you. Oh to think that you sent her. - [Man] Goodnight. - I see. (laughing) (clock chiming) - [Man] I had known Maud for some years and she helped to make my trips to London enjoyable and rewarding occasions. (Maud giggles) (bright music) And although I enjoyed Maud's company immensely, on this particular visit my mind was elsewhere. - Charles, what are you thinking about? - What else should I think about? You. - That's a compliment. And a lie. You've been distant all evening. Why? Or should I say who? Charlie, are you getting tired of me? We've known each other a long time. - Maud, I'm always discovering something new. (Maud moans) - Charlie, you're not thinking about me. - Nonsense, Maud. And anyway all I had in my mind was Oakhurst, my place in the country. I'm resolved to make some changes once I'm back. Some unexpected problems came up. - So what are you going to do now? - I don't know. Just wait and see I suppose. - Well, when you've made up your mind, darling, tell me about it. I can be very understanding. - I know that Maud, and believe I am grateful. (Maud moans) When I returned to the country from London, it was becoming clear that I could no longer keep my discovery about Frances a secret. In an effort to contain myself, I told Frances that I would be away traveling for some months abroad. (tense music) I found that the sights and places I had so looked forward to visiting seemed sad and somehow lonely. And I realized that what I lacked was a companion to whom I could convey my thoughts. And that companion I thought about was not Maud, but another, a forlorn little figure alone in my country home and perhaps waiting for me. The weeks I spent away lengthened into months but my feelings instead of becoming weaker grew even stronger. (thoughtful music) And so finally I came home. It was late when I reached the house and the staff were in bed. So I opened the door myself. (clock chimes) (fire crackling) (clears throat) - (gasps) Oh it's you. Oh you're back. I'm so glad you've come back. I've missed you dreadfully. - You missed me? Why do you sigh like that? Men don't sigh. I do declare Frank, what would the servants say if they saw us together like this? For goodness sake, Frank, men don't cry. You're working up an absolute shower. Here. A gentleman should make himself presentable. - I'm not a gentleman. I'm a woman and I love you. - [Charles] I know. - How did you find out? - I've known for some time. It was the day you were being punished. - Oh, why didn't you say anything? - I preferred to wait until you told me yourself. I thought sure that one day you would tell me. And I'm glad that day has come at last. - I wanted so much to tell you. But I didn't have the courage to speak-- - What does it matter now I love you. Tell me, when did you first begin to love me? - Oh, the very day we met. And I was homeless and friendless and ever since my love has been growing greater. - Weren't you angry when I beat you? - Oh no, never. Of course it hurt me at the time. But somehow after I loved you even more. - [Charles] And then? - It was terrible, but very exciting. - And afterwards? - I wanted you to make love to me. - And now? - I want you to make love to me and I want you to teach me how to make love to you. - It's late. - I'm ready. (thoughtful music) - Undress yourself so I can see you as you really are. - Very well. (clock chimes) (sensual music) (Frances exclaims) Now I know that you love me. - And I truly that you are a woman. (clock chimes) (Frances moans) How did you sleep? - Very, very well. I didn't open my eyes from the time I went to sleep. I was very tired after what happened last night. What time is it? - Six o'clock. - What would the servants say if they saw us? (bright piano music) My dearest I can hardly believe what's happened. - Neither can I. Later we must decide what should be done. Never fear, our love is good and strong. Frances did not appear at breakfast but later in the day we went riding together. I felt the time had come when she would tell me the whole truth about her past and the reasons why I discovered her a year ago clad as a boy, penniless and desperate. The tale of her parents' death in Canada was true and now I was to learn of the mysterious friends who appeared on the scene when the funds for her schooling came to an end. - Come in. Frances, this is Frances Holmes. The girl of whom we spoke. Frances, this is Mrs. Leslie. Mrs. Leslie knows of your present circumstances, Frances. And that, unfortunately there is no other alternative but for you to leave this establishment. - Yes madam. - [School Mistress] Mrs. Leslie has most kindly offered to take you into her house as a companion to her young daughter. You must thank her, Frances. - Thank you, ma'am. - Go and pack your things then, Frances. You're leaving with Mrs. Leslie. So go and get ready right away. - Yes, ma'am. - A charming young girl. So pretty. - I hope she'll give you every satisfaction. - So do I. - [Charles] The home of Mrs. Leslie was in a London suburb. (unsettling music) By the security of the gate it would appear that Mrs. Leslie believed in protecting her privacy. (bright piano music) - Wait a minute for me, my dear. - [Charles] The atmosphere of the interior was luxurious and to Frances, quite overwhelming. - Rose, that'll do. Don't be shy my dear. Come in. This is Ms. Dundas, my assistant. She will show you to your room. - Come along, Frances. - Oh, Mrs. Leslie, when shall I meet your daughter? - My daughter? - Yes, am I not to be her companion? - Oh that. That was a misunderstanding. I have a son. He's away at the moment. There are however, a number of young ladies here under my charge. You'll meet them at breakfast. Now run along my dear. Ms. Dundas will help you change, hmm? (unsettling music) - That's enough. I've told you to be quiet. Please girls. Do you hear? - Silence please, ladies. I would ask you to exercise a little discretion in your conversation today. We have a new arrival. (girls murmuring) Frances, meet Alice, Ethyl, Edith, Victoria, Clara. I shall now say grace. For what we are about to receive oh Lord, we give you our sincere thanks. - [Girls] Amen. - Good morning. Excuse me, did you get to bed very late? - No, rather early. You're very sweet and very pretty. And very precious. (bell dings) - [Charles] That very afternoon Frances was brought down from her room by Ms. Dundas. And introduced to a certain Mr. Wood. - [Mrs. Leslie] There you are, Frances. Come and say hello to Mr. Wood. - Charming. Turn around my dear. What a sweet little girl you are. Would you like a sweet? Sweets to the sweet my dear. - Thank you sir. - [Mr. Wood] Don't be shy. Have another. (Frances exclaims) - Stop her. She won't go far. That girl will have to be taught some manners. I do apologize. As you can see, she's quite new here. - Yes I do see. How old is she, Mrs. Leslie? - Best not to ask, Mr. Wood. She's very, very young. Ms. Dundas, will you please go upstairs and make sure Frances has returned to her room? And while you're at it lock the door. - [Ms. Dundas] Yes, Mrs. Leslie. - Now Mr. Wood, I'm certain we can come to another arrangement for today. Clara. (Mr. Wood chuckles) (unsettling music) I have good news for you, my dear. - Yes ma'am. - Mr. Wood has taken quite a fancy to you. So much so that I've arranged for you to spend the night with him. (Frances gasps) Oh, come now, Frances. You're being fed and dressed here at a great deal of expense. I'm only asking you to trifle in return. (Frances sobs) If there's one thing I can't tolerate in a young girl, it's ingratitude. - Now Frances, crying won't change matters. You'll get no sympathy if you're disobedient. It's time you were taught a lesson. - A lesson in my 10 commandments. Thou shalt not be ungrateful, disobedient, disrespectful, uncooperative, impertinent. There, that's how we deal with ingratitude here. That was the first part of our list. The other five are a repeat of the same. (knocking at door) Come in. - Ma'am, gentleman visitors. - I'll be right down, Ethyl. - [Ms. Dundas] All right Ethyl, go on. - I'll deal with you later, my girl. I'll tell Mr. Wood that you're not feeling well tonight but that tomorrow you'll be much better. And just to be certain you haven't forgotten today's little lesson, Ms. Dundas and I will come back tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon. (Frances sobs) Lock her in. - [Visitor] Activity going on here. Be my guest. - [Visitor] Thank you. (dramatic music) - There, there, child. Dry those tears. Nobody's going to hurt you as long as you're a good girl. - But I don't wanna go with Mr. Wood or anybody else. - But some of the gentlemen who visit here are real gentlemen. Cheer up, Frances. You never know, there could be a way out. (slap cracks) That was foolish, child. You'll find you could've used a friend here. (bright music) (women exclaiming) (ominous tones) - That's ridiculous. (man babbling) Silly. - My little sugar pie. All over that. Want some more champagne. Just rub it in. That's how much I'd like to eat you up. Come here, come here, come to me. Oh, a little bit lower, a little bit lower. Yes. Ah take those mittens off. - Me? - Yes. (unsettling music) (men laughing) ♪ Come a waltzing Matilda with me ♪ - [Man] You'd like that, wouldn't you? - [Charles] And so young Frances escaped. She had no money save a few coins which she found in the pocket of the boy's jacket which she now wore. In school she had read about the sea and resolved to reach port and find work aboard a ship. She bought a railway ticket and then penniless tried to walk the rest of the way. It was thus I discovered her, worn out and half starved, two days later on the road to Southampton. (melancholy piano music) You were dreaming? - Oh yes, only of you. - [Charles] You suffered so much before I met you. - It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now that I have you. - [Charles] And that I have you. (sensual music) (Frances moans) (Frances moans) (horse neighs) That morning I had to leave for London on business. But I felt guilty. In all the guilt it was because I knew I was going to see Maud. (bright music) But Maud had a surprise for me. She told me of her intention to be married. And so I decided the time had come to confide in her my own secret, the truth about Frank, or rather Frances and I. - [Maud] Why Charlie, I'd love to meet her. - And so you shall. I'll bring her up to town next week. But I warn you she only has her boy's clothes to wear. - Well, we'll change that. You just leave her with me. (thunder rumbles) (Charles chuckles) - I can always count on you, can't I? I don't doubt that you'll be a wonderful teacher for her. (laughing) (Maud moans) (Maud moans) (Maud exclaims) (Maud exclaims) (frenzied music) (gasps) (Maud moans) (Maud exclaims) (Charles moans) (both exclaim) (tense tones) And in London you can lead a normal life as a young lady. - How wonderful. But Charles, I shall miss everyone. Mrs. Evans, Watson and all the others. Since my mother and father died they are the only family I've known. What will you tell them? - Simply that you're going away to be educated. - Little do they know how far my education has already progressed. - (chuckles) This is more in the nature of finishing school. And I have every confidence that Maud will prove a very experienced teacher. - And I'll be a willing pupil. But Charles, will she be jealous of me? - Maud? Heavens no. She has the very best in good humor. And now that she is to be married herself, I think her only desire will be to teach you how to please me. - You mean I'm not satisfactory to you? - My darling Frances, you're everything a man could desire and this man in particular. But there are certain, shall we call them maidenly graces, you must learn? - How long are you gonna be away? - For some considerable time. I have business overseas. But when I return, I look forward to finding two very fair ladies waiting to greet me. (happy music) It was with a keen sense of anticipation that I returned to England to discover how Frances and Maud had reacted to each other. I need not have feared, however, for Maud's broad minded attitude and Frances' sweet innocence made a perfect combination. It's wonderful to see you again. - Good to see you too. Charles, let me help you. You've arrived in time. - It's good to be home, I dare say. (Maud giggles) - I have a surprise for you. - What is it? - Come on. - [Charles] The surprise however was the transformation of Frances. - Charles. - Here she is. - [Charles] My word, Frances! You take my breath away. - You like the dress? You don't think it's too daring? - [Charles] You'll stop the traffic in the strand when we go to dinner. - We're dining out? All three of us together? How splendid. Where are you taking us? - [Charles] Where else but Romano's? (Frances gasps) - Oh it's splendid. (laughing) - I propose a toast. To Maud, may she enjoy every happiness in her new life. - Dear Maud, may you be as happy as I already am. - And now it's my turn to propose a toast. To the new occupants of Primrose Cottage, Maida Vale. God bless them. Frances, you look lovely. Take good care of her, Charlie. She's a real treasure. - Never fear, Maud. I intend to. It's getting late. - Oh Charlie, I just thought of something. There's only one bedroom at the villa. - [Charles] What a dreadful problem. And what are we going to do? - Oh we'll find a way. (laughing) (bright music) (Frances sighs) (Frances moans) (fire crackles) (gentle music) - [Charles] So Frances settled down into her new home and to her new life. - Charles. - [Charles] I found myself spending more and more of my time in London. And particularly in her company. However I still found time for the occasional batchelor evening at my club. I was enjoying a moment of relaxation when my solitude was interrupted by Comte Ricky von Harmstorf, member of the Austrian diplomatic service and attache to the embassy. He'd somehow arranged an honorary membership to my club. I didn't know him very well and had no real desire to improve upon my slight acquaintance. - May I join you? - By all means, Ricky. - [Man] Thank you again. - I haven't seen you here recently, Beaumont. - I've been busy. - Hmm. Perhaps you need a little relaxation. - That's just what I had in mind. - Relaxing alone? - Why not? - I have a better idea. Why don't you come with me on a little excursion I'm planning for tonight? - That all depends what you're planning. - A visit to a discreet little establishment of which I've had some very interesting reports. - Indeed. - The lady who runs the place has quite a reputation as a provider. Mrs. Leslie. - Mrs. Leslie? - Yes. Do you know her? - No, but I've heard of her. (upbeat music) - Good evening, gentlemen. - Mrs. Leslie, I've brought a friend with me. I've been telling him all about you. - Favorably I trust. - Entirely, Mrs. Leslie. This is my friend Charles. - Good evening, sir. - [Charles] Good evening. - Will you follow me, gentlemen. - Your shop gets lovelier and lovelier. Any changes in the stock since I was last here? - Oh yes. We do have one or new two new beauties. You'll meet them. I'm sure you two gentlemen didn't come here to talk to me. (both laughing) Ms. Dundas, call the girls down, would you? - Yes, Mrs. Leslie. - Won't you be seated? We pride ourselves in catering to all tastes here. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. (girls murmuring) (upbeat music) Gentlemen, may I present Rosemarie, Clara, Edith, Elizabeth and Ethyl. - That little filly is the one for me. - Wouldn't you gentlemen care to order some refreshment? - By all means. - [Mrs. Leslie] Champagne is customary. - I'm all in favor of keeping to the customs of the house. (girls laughing) - Ms. Dundas, champagne. Now gentlemen, what is your pleasure? You may go upstairs with either one or two of the girls if you like. We have rooms fitted out for the more exotic tastes. Or if you prefer you can see our tableau vivant first. I confess I take particular pride in them. - Sounds interesting, eh Charles? - Why not? Sounds like a good idea. - Come along, girls, this should put you in the mood. And after the show, Mrs. Leslie, I have a mind to make a trip upstairs with this young lady. - Come along girls, drink up. You'd better be getting dressed. (chuckles) - Or undressed, as the case may be. (girls murmuring) - And now the show will commence. - Is anything the matter? You don't seem to be enjoying yourself? - No no, I'm all right. - Gentlemen, the virgin bride on her wedding day. (tentative applauding) It is an occasion of great joy, yet restrained by the rules of decorum and tradition. The public ceremony ends and the private one begins. (sensual music) (tentative applauding) Oh thank you, gentlemen, thank you. And now a dramatic tableau, taken from recent events in Russia. The punishment of a nihilist in a Russian prison. (whip cracks) (woman exclaims) (tense tones) - You know Charles, that is not real blood. It's just red water. - Very effective. - My word, I really think you wish it were real. - Nonsense. (sensual music) (whip cracks) (woman exclaims) (tentative applauding) - And so justice is done. The nihilist receives her just desserts. And now, gentlemen for your individual amusements. The lady awaits your pleasure. - And we mustn't keep her waiting. Come along my dear. What was your name? - Kate, sir. - Come on and kiss me, young Kate. (bright music) - And what about you, sir? What may we do for your pleasure? Is there no one here who strikes your fancy? - Not tonight, I fear. Perhaps some other time. Tell me, Mrs. Leslie, did you not sometime ago introduce into this establishment the young lady by the name of Frances? - Frances? Oh, we've had so many young girls here. They come and they go. - It may help you to recollect if I tell you she left this place dressed as a boy. - Oh yes. Now I remember. Ungrateful child. When I rescued her she was about to be thrown out of her school. Her parents had died and left her penniless. I gave her every opportunity to improve her fortune. But she refused my advice. - And just what was that advice? - [Mrs. Leslie] Well, to be nice to gentlemen of course. - And when she declined, did you beat her? - I certainly did. But it made no difference. She stole some of my son's clothes and ran away. I've never seen her since. And I wouldn't care to. - I imagine she shares those sentiments as far as you're concerned, Mrs. Leslie. - Are you leaving, sir? - No, not yet. Before I go there's some advice I would like to give you. Thou shalt not be ungrateful. (slaps) (Mrs. Leslie exclaims) - [Mrs. Leslie] Oh, oh stop it. - [Charles] Disobedient. - [Mrs. Leslie] Oh, how dare you? - [Charles] Disrespectful. - [Mrs. Leslie] Oh, oh no. - [Charles] Impertinent. (Mrs. Leslie exclaims) (sad music) Why haven't you more decency? You have a good name in this town for providing pleasure for those who can afford to pay for it. Watch out. One day you may have to pay an even higher price. Goodnight, ma'am. - Ms. Dundas, if Mr. Charles should appear here again, see that he's not admitted. That gentleman is no gentleman. And what are you doing with my shoe? (sad music) - [Charles] When I returned to find Frances fast asleep, I was overcome with emotions of love and concern. This sweet girl had placed herself and her future in my hands. The following year I decided to take the grand tour and took Frances with me. I was resolved not to betray her trust. It would be no fault of mine if she ever had to return to the life in which she so luckily escaped. We traveled extensively and wherever we went we seemed to acquire friends. The friends included a young American whose conversation would amuse Frances. His name was Brook. I had made inquiries and learnt that he had a talent for making himself amusing. And what had little money and no substance. - You get better every game. (Frances chuckles) And each time you win, well you look even more beautiful. - Flattery will get you nowhere. - Not even your company for another hour? - I must be getting back to the hotel. - Oh you won't be missed. - I will. - Frances, can we have dinner together tonight? - I shan't be free. - Lucky Mr. Beaumont. - He's my guardian. - He acts more like your jailer. You're never out of his sight for more than an hour or two. And even when you are alone you're terrified he'll miss you. - You make him sound like an ogre. He's just concerned about me. - Well so am I. Now listen to me, Frances. I followed you here to Le Touquet and I don't intend to let you get away. Now don't you realize, I'm in love with you. - Oh please. I will. - I want to marry you. - It's impossible. And anyway you don't know anything about me. - I know everything I need to know. Simply that you are the most endearing and attractive girl a man could ever hope to make his wife. - I really must be going. - Not until you tell me when we meet again. - Soon. I'll send you a message. But you must understand it's impossible for me to marry you. - I specialize in the impossible, yeah. In fact I'm generally known as being an impossible young man. - You are impossible. - Did you win? - Yes, I won. - Who were you playing? - Why do you ask? - Was it young Mr. Brook? - Charlie, you're not jealous are you? - Mm, suppose I was. Would you see him again? You still haven't answered my question. - Didn't my lips give you the answer? - I want to hear the words. (Frances sighs) - Oh really Charlie, don't be silly. Mr. Brook amuses me. I don't take him seriously and I expect you to feel the same way. Well he's half your age. - That doesn't necessarily reassure me. - And if I tell you I don't care a fig for Mr. Brook, does that help? Charles? - Frances, we're leaving Le Touquet in the morning. We're going back to London. - But you told me we were staying 'til the end of the month. - There's been a change of plan. - Because of Mr. Brook? - There are other reasons. I have business to attend to. - [Frances] Business that you weren't bothered about last week before Mr. Brook turned up in Le Touquet. - Frances, if you love me I want you to promise me something. - Oh Charlie, of course I love you. - No, I'm serious. I want you to promise me not to see Mr. Brook again. - If we're leaving Le Touquet in the morning I'm hardly likely to. - I want you to promise in any case. - Very well. I promise. (bright music) - [Charles] When we'd returned to England it was the shooting season. And I couldn't resist leaving Frances in London and spending a few days in the country. The sport was good and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I had written to Frances, telling her that I was spending a few more days at Oakhurst. But in fact I returned to London somewhat earlier than I had anticipated. There was no sign of her at the villa. Then I remembered, in her letter she had told me that she had purchased a young puppy. No doubt she would be in the park exercising the dog. (tense music) - You shouldn't have come here. - I couldn't stay away. You received my letter? - How did you find my address? - The concierge at the hotel in Le Touquet. It wasn't difficult. - You mustn't write to me again and you shouldn't try to see me. - Frances, it's no use. You can't stop me from loving you. I'll continue to follow you to the ends of the Earth if I have to. - Please, you mustn't. - When can we meet again? - I don't know if I want to meet you. - But I love you. - If you love me, please go. (children yelling playfully) Oh Charles. You have to meet Tilly. - [Charles] I've seen him already. - How can that be? (Frances scoffs) (sighs) Oh. So that's why you aren't very friendly. - How often have you been seeing him? - Who, Mr. Brook? - Of course Mr. Brook. - Today was the first time since Le Touquet. He wrote and insisted he should call. I refused. - So you met him in the park? - He must've followed me. I didn't expect to see him again-- - Nor did I. - I would've told you. - Would you? - Charlie it's true. Charlie don't go. - You broke your promise. - Charlie! Charlie don't leave me. (door slams) (sighs) (sobs) Oh Tilly. - You're back again? Solitary drinking, eh? That's a very bad sign. - Do you want to join me? - Not really. I have other plans. To tell you the truth, I'm planning to pay another visit to Mrs. Leslie. I hear she's got some new attractions. Would you like to join me? - No thank you. - Come on, do you good. If you don't want to indulge yourself, there's always a tableau vivant. There are some new additions in that department too, also I'm told. Including a little more punishment. - Really? - No offense, Charles. We are all human, you know. - This way. - [Guest] I'm following. - Goodnight. - [Host] Just at the top of the stairs. - [Charles] Poor fool. - Charles, you've come back? - No. I've come by to pick up some things. Tonight I'm going to sleep at the club and tomorrow I'm going back to Oakhurst. - Oh Charles, forgive me. I know I broke my promise, but it wasn't my fault. Punish me any way you like. But listen to me and love me. - Do you mean that? - I do. Just as long afterwards you forgive me. Punish me. Are you going to hurt me very much? - You'll receive only what you deserve. (whip cracks) (Frances grunts) (whip cracks) (Frances grunts) (whip cracks) (Frances grunts) (whip cracks) (Frances exclaims) (whip cracks) (Frances exclaims) (whip cracks) (Frances exclaims) (whip cracks) (Frances exclaims) (whip cracks) (Frances exclaims) (whip cracks) (Frances exclaims) (whip cracks) (Frances exclaims) (whimpering) Are you all right, my love? I don't know what came over me. I'd never hit a woman. - Do you really hate me? - I love you. I beg you to forgive me. (sad music) When I reflected on what had happened, I felt drained of emotion and ashamed of my behavior. The term gentleman with which I'd always associated my conduct, suddenly seemed to be inappropriate. That imposter to hurt her which had seized me so recently, happily was gone. It was not the type of emotion to which I was accustomed. - [Frances] Charles? - What is it? - I have come to a decision. - [Charles] A decision? What sort of decision? - Concerning us. - Us? - Precisely. I have come to the decision that I should leave you. - [Charles] You're not serious. - I couldn't be more serious. I'm leaving you. - But Frances, why? - I'm nothing more than your mistress and much less than the woman I've decided to become. - I don't understand. - Circumstances forced me to assume the identity of another sex, thanks to you, Charles. I've become so conscious of my own sex that I suffered myself to become the chattel of another. - The chattel? - Have you a better word? How about baggage? - What are you trying to do, belittle yourself? - No, just come to terms with myself and you. - I don't understand. - I know you don't. Oh Charles, I do so care for you still. But to you I shall always be a child. And I wanna be a woman. - Have you thought about becoming a wife? - Do you mean that? - I wouldn't have said it otherwise. (happy music) (Frances moans) (Frances moans) (Frances moans) (Frances moans) (Frances moans) (bells chiming) If the servants were surprised at the sight of their new mistress they were certainly too well trained to show it. And so we settled down to married life together. (melancholy piano music) Where did you find that? - I saved it as a souvenir. Remember? (happy music) - You're so beautiful. And such a rascal. I cannot help but think that after such strange beginnings how happy our life has been. And I wonder how it would've been if he had been a boy.
