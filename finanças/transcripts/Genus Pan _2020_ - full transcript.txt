Dearest, you are my life. This heart is only yours. Your photo with me is the source of the joy of this heart. Because of you, this world is so much alive. It seems like everything has a song. The farm and the wind are even jealous. And the stream of love is singing My sweet love for you will never fade. Even though I will completely vanish from the naked eye. Forevermore I swear I won't change. I will love you until the very end. My sweet love for you will never fade. Even though I will completely vanish from the naked eye. Forevermore I swear I won't change. I will love you until the very end. Andres Hanibal. Jose Valenzuela. Baldomero Catabay. Paulo Homero. Sir Baldo. That's all for now. Can I pay later? I'll pay when we get back here in the mine. Andres, that's not part of our deal. Complete your payment. I brought you here. A deal is a deal. My sister, Naty, is sick. I'll add this money for her medication. We've been here for three months and I didn't ask to be paid every time our salary is given. A deal is a deal. Pay me in full! I'm sorry but the contract has ended. I want to beg you, Sir. -We really need the money for the medication.. -Andres! You should learn how to honor commitments. Here. Softdrink. Thank you, Sir. Have you eaten? -No, thanks. I'm not hungry. Have you packed your bags? Yes, Sir. Do we have a boat already? - Baldo is arranging it. We can leave tomorrow at dawn or on the next day. Just... Just prepare. The demand for the boat is high. That's why these boatmen are raising their prices. Are we leaving our stuff? Of course! You missed the news. They're asking us to return after a month. They will need a lot of workers. But, robbery is rampant here. Our stuff might get lost. Manager will handle it. We just hand him some money. - How much would that be? - Baldo said, 700 pesos each. But he might lower it down to 600 pesos or 500 pesos. That's a lot. With so many deductions in our salary, there's not much left for us. There's nothing we could do. Manager has a cut. We also gave money to Sir Baldo. There's also a fee for looking over our stuff. When we get to the island, we also give money to Captain. And to Sergeant. Nothing left for us. I thought I could save money for my sister's medication. It's so tiring. Maybe... Maybe I won't go back mining here. What about your stuff? Stuff? If you want, I can sell them to you for a lower price. Take all of them. I just need the money for my sister's medication. I'll check first. We've plenty of expenses as well. My wife will go to Hernani. We hope to give something to our grandkids. Their condition is not good there. What will you do then, if you won't come back here? I don't know. Efren's group will head to Claveria. They say they need men to work at the docks. If I won't be lucky, I can hunt for wild boars and birds. I will sell dried meat to the other island. Well, think about it. Here, they say there are plenty of gold. That's why we just keep on mining. I find it hard here. More than half of our earnings go to other people. That's not right. We don't have control on those things. And our lives have no protection here. In three months, how many have been buried alive here? Some deaths are suspicious. Takoy and Gener mysteriously vanished! Fuck you, Andres, shut your mouth up! You will get us into trouble! Look around you. Be a bit cautious. Andres... With our condition here, it's survival of the fittest. You should use your mind. Not your emotions. I think you should not come back here. Please don't tell my plans to Sir Baldo. Before the island was called Hugaw Island, it was called Sleeping Turtle Island. It was coined by the Americans because they say it looks like a sleeping turtle. But according to the tribesmen, the island was called Pagabuhitan. The island seem to be dancing in the clouds. There are many stories about Hugaw Island. During the Japanese occupation, they built a garrison. But they didn't build a camp. What they built was what they called "R and R," a secret place where they would rest and had sexual tryst. They abducted women from different islands. They locked them up there. So the officers who wanted to rest and have sexual tryst were brought to Hugaw Island. So that's why it was called Hugaw Island since then. Dirt. Dirty. Yes, a dirty island. But this one is true. A lot of people say I am a son of a Japanese. Paulo is also a son of a Japanese. Almost all of the people of our age were also sons of Japanese people so it's just not us. Get dressed. Hey. Dress up. Why? Let's have fun. It's on me. What will we do? We'll drink and... Manager brought girls. He said he'll give one girl to us. So, what do you say? Get up now! I'll pass. We'll have a long trip tomorrow. Then sleep at the boat! We've been working our asses off for three months here. How many times have we nearly been buried alive? Come on, we need this! Get up now. I apologize in behalf of your Sir Baldo. It's prayer time and yet we're doing something else. It's your turn, Paulo. Damn that girl for teasing me. She said it takes long for me to get a hard on. It won't be the case for you, I guarantee. You're still young. Paulo might be teased as well. He has less practice than me. Take us at the back of Hugaw Island. Not at the barrio. But why? It's dangerous there. That's the back of the forest. You would have to walk. If you drop us off in town, I'm very sure nothing will be left from our salary. Those predators will take all of our hard-earned money. Okay, let's settle it then. I'll just ask for extra payment; that's quite far. Deal. I'll just talk to Andres and Paulo then I'll get back to you. Sir Paulo? Where is Sir Baldo? He must be with Manager. Sir Paulo? I will just give you my stuff. Think about it real hard, Andres. No need. I'm done with pocket mining. But you're sure to earn money here. But if our lives are at stake, never mind, then. Anyway... Anyway, what, Andres? I can't stand what's happening here. Even in our place, in Hugaw Island. It's been bugging me even in my dreams. I always see Peping. It is tormenting me. This place is controlled by a few people. Even our very own island. They are the law. I don't want to be witness to this kind of dirt all my life. How many lives have they wrecked? How many people are left in our place? How many? It's because of them. Where would you go, Andres? Wherever. One day, Hugaw Island's destiny will change. When will that be, Sir Paulo? God will have mercy on us. Never mind. Fuck that god, Sir Paulo. Respect God, Andres. Where is he, then? Where was he when they falsely accused Aling Imang? Until now, she's locked up in jail but we're still quiet about it. Where is that god when they killed my brother Peping? When they raped the tribeswomen in the mountain? What did my brother do to deserve being chopped? Just because he didn't give enough money to Captain? Just because he didn't give enough money to Sergeant? Fuck them! Shut up, shut up, Andres! Sir Paulo, until Captain is there, until Sergeant is there, as long as the Vargas family takes hold of the islands here, nothing will happen. Quiet! They might hear you and we might be in trouble. Sir Paulo, what are you afraid of? I'm not afraid at all, Andres. I'm just protective of the situation of my children and my grandkids in the other island. I'm being careful for the few of us who are left in Hugaw Island. We should use our head and not our emotions. Baldo, we're here. Hey, Andres, your shoes. Thank you, Dong! Let's move. Let's not wait for the dark here. Safer in the mountain. Our sailing was smooth. My father and I were willing to stay at the sea for three days. My mother prepared adobo for us, dried fish and pinamarhan.. There's also rice cake. My father plans to go to Punta Negro at full moon. You went there? Wait. That's the most dangerous part of Hugaw Island. Entering is prohibited there. The waves are strong and the rocks are sharp. But according to my father, the most delicious squid and tuna are there. Your father is like that. He's got a strange attitude. And very stubborn. My mother had been begging us to stop going there to fish. But father assured her during those times that... the water is calm. My mother allowed us to go. During the first two nights, we caught a lot of squid. Of course, Father and I were very happy. That's why the third night came as a surprise. The water seemed suddenly to be in a rage. The waves were as big as houses. I got separated from my father. The last time I saw my father was... when he was struggling to get me while I was drowning. When I woke up, the sea was calm. I was floating. When I woke up, I was hugging my father's paddle. Your father is a very good man, Andres. No, he's also naughty. We used to rob at Aling Marta's guava yard. One time, Old Torong caught us and went after us. Good thing, we were able to jump at the river. There is a new and outstanding research made by scientists and psychologists, Marian. What is it about? It's about the human mind. It's about what they call Homo Sapiens. It's basically about us, humans. Go ahead and let's hear it from you, Dr. Nana Salindab. According to this research, the human beings' brain are not yet fully developed. Each of us have a different level of brain development. Humans are primate species, right? Ah, yes... We are what they consider as the modern and progressive primate species. So, our developments are far in comparison to our relatives, the apes. The closest in comparison would be those called pan or chimpanzees. According to the research of these scientists, a lot of us humans still have the brain of the pan or chimps even though their physical looks are very human. They say that the models of fully developed brains are those of Jesus Christ's, Mahatma Gandhi's, Mother Teresa's, and Buddha's. Why is that, Dr. Salindab? A complete and fully developed brain, according to them, have those attributes or likeness just like Buddha, Christ and the saints. They are well-developed and are altruistic. They no longer feel anger, jealousy, they don't lie, they're not greedy, the desire to kill, the desire to conquer, to rob or to get power. Pans or chimpanzees, still bear the negative attitudes I have mentioned. Chimpanzees are very violent and selfish beings. That's why according to these experts, people who have attributes like chimpanzees have brains which have the same level like Pan's. Wow, that research is something. Meaning, dictators, fascists, demagogues, killers, those who steal, those who get jealous, and those who lie are still in the level of chimpanzees. Yes, Marian. They are still in the level of Pan or chimpanzees. Oh no, Doctor, I still get jealous. Does it mean that my brain is still in the chimp level? Is it deep there, Andres? No, Sir. Where is Paulo? He pooped at the river. He said he'll take a bath after. How's your mother? She's doing fine. She finds it hard to speak already. I think she might lose her voice soon. Is that so? Such a pity. You want some biscuits? I already ate bread earlier while you're sleeping. I have a sweet coconut bread here. No, thanks. Manager said, next month, when we return, he'll raise our salaries. I'll just call Sir Paulo so we can proceed with walking. Be careful, the cliff is steep! Paulo. Thanks. How's Andres? He seems fine. Why? He seem to be avoiding me even in talking. He might be thinking of other things. His big sister, Naty, is in a hospital in Roxas. His mom is losing her voice. Who hasn't got problems? Don't he dare be rude at me or else, he'll hear from me. Have patience on him. I am patient, you know that, Paulo. Don't he dare disrespect me. I won't allow it. Let's go. Let's leave later. We just sat down. I will tell you when we should leave. It's getting humid. What did you say, Andres? What did you say? I said it's getting more humid. I know what you mean. You don't like my decision. No, Sir. It's true. It's getting humid. Let's be careful with what we're saying. That's how coarseness of character shows. But if the attitude is really coarse- I ask for a little respect. Let's go. Andres. I've been looking for you. Just wanted to get some air, Sir. Andres... I want to request something to you. Let's fix this disagreement with your Sir Baldo immediately. Ask for his forgiveness. Why am I to ask for his forgiveness? You heard what he told me, right? But you are much younger. You should be the humble one. But what about his extorting act on us? But that's a deal. But it isn't right. You are his friend. I treat him as my second father, just like you. Is it right that he extorts money from us? I feel bad that he's doing that to us. It is his burden. If he can take doing that extortion thing, it's his own cross to bear. It's just sad, that he's turning like the corrupt people in this place. It makes me lose respect for him. I know that. That's also how I feel. Baldomero is an old friend. It's really hard to accept it. Just consider thinking of his late wife, Maria. She just passed away. Baldo is still grieving. He's still blaming himself for it. He doesn't even want to talk about it. And his burden is also his daughter, Mariposa. Let's go now, come. Be the humble one. Let's be more patient with him. Sir Baldo... I want to ask for your forgiveness. I want to apologize for what happened. I should be the one to say sorry. I was surprised with what I said as well. Might be my age. I get mad easily now. Sir Paulo would like to know if you want to proceed. OK, let's go. Paulo. Don't you have news or music in your radio? None. No radio station can get through. There was a connection only at the start of our journey. Let's go. I'll just get us some drinking water by the river. Give me your bottles. I will tell you something, Baldo. What is it, Paulo? This isn't for me. This is for Andres but he doesn't know this. What is it? I will give you the money you took from him. Return the money to him. What? How's that? We will return the money you took from him. The money you will return to him will come from me. Let's pretend you volunteered to do that. Is that clear, Baldo? Why would you do that? You're meddling again. They badly need money. -Are you sure with what you're doing? -Yes, of course. Suit yourself. You've always been dumb. Call me dumb as you wish. Here. Hand this over to him when you two are left alone. Don't forget me, Saint Paulo, when you get to heaven, okay? Don't worry, Baldo. I will pray for you a lot. A never-ending "Our Father." Asshole. We're the same, Baldo. This is your decision, okay? Yes. Andres. Come over here. Why, Sir? I know I have a bad impression on you. But I'm not a liar. - I didn't say you are... - I'll give you something. Listen to what I'll say. If you let Paulo know about this, you'll hear from me. Okay? This is just between us. Clear? Yes, Sir. As for me, Andres... I need your word. You will honor what you tell me you would do. Clear? This is your money. My money? The one you gave me. I will explain. Paulo approached me earlier. He said he feels sorry for you. He gave me money equivalent to what I took from you. He said, I should tell you it came from me. That I am supposedly returning the money. Clear? - This is from Sir Paulo? - Yes. I take your word, okay? Paulo. Seems like Clown can hear us. Clown is here. Clown really love us. Clown! How are you? Stop it, Baldo. Clown, you want us to perform again, ha? Come. Paulo, let's perform! The crowd is waiting! Let's go! Shut up, Baldo! Come on! Let's show them we can still perform. And that we can still join the circus. Come on! Gecko! Let's do it! Twin Geckos! We are The Twin Geckos! - Come on! - I said no! Gecko! We are The Twin Geckos! Gecko! We are The Twin Geckos! Clown? Fuck you! Fuck you, Clown! Fuck you! You're an animal! - Fuck you! - Sir Baldo! - Fuck it. - Sir Baldo! - That's enough, Sir Baldo. - Fuck you! One more night of walking and we'll get there. Paulo. What is it, Baldo? Here. This is the address of my brother in Tagbilaran. If anything bad happens to me, please send him a telegram and tell him to get Mariposa. Upon his arrival, kindly give this letter. Thank you, Paulo. Sir Paulo! Sir Paulo! What is it? Andres? Hey, Andres! Why? I saw a big black horse! What? I saw the big, black horse! Don't you joke around like that, Andres! Andres! Breathe. Relax. Calm down. Is what you're saying true? Yes, I saw it. I told you that boy brings bad luck! What now? Don't believe the myths of this island. It is only a myth from the tribesmen. It's not in the Bible. It's only a pagan belief and it's not true. But he saw the black horse! Then he saw it! He saw a black horse. That's it. Nothing wrong with that. But why is there a horse here when the tribe is at the other side of the mountain? The tribe has no horse! We don't know if the Americans or the Japanese left one! Where did you see it? At the river, Sir. Let's check! I saw it right there, in the water! Are you sure? Yes! Let's check for traces. Is there any? None. Andres! You know what this means? Because of you, we three are cursed! One of us will die or worse, all three of us will die! It will be a bloody death! Let's go. Sir Paulo. Is the curse true? No, it's not true. It's just a myth. Andres... Andres! Why are you sleeping here? I'm just trying to distance myself. Your Sir Paulo is not mad anyway. He's just crazy over the curse of the black horse. Come. Sleep over there. Come. I'll go later. I want to ask you something. Earlier, before you saw the black horse, did you eat a buta fruit? Yes, Sir. I picked some at the riverside. Did you eat a lot? Plenty, yes. Therefore, there's no black horse. It's the effect of the buta fruit. It is really delicious. But eating it excessively, can affect your psyche. It makes you intoxicated. And when you take too much, it will poison you. - But I really saw the horse. - You didn't see any, Andres, it's just hallucination. Buta fruit's effect. You are in a dream state. Let's go. Come! We have to leave early tomorrow. But Sir Baldo is still mad at me. No. I have talked to him already. Let's go. Three more hours before we reach the barrio. That is, if we don't stop walking. But it's almost dusk. What do you think? We don't need to rush, really. I know we'll reach home soon. Let's spend the night here. The forest is dangerous. I brought two long necks. And- two canned corned beef from New Zealand. This is from Manager. This is good. Let's say a prayer before we eat and drink. Let's say thanks for getting past the mountain and forest safely. - Ah, yes. Of course. - Yes, Sir. Do you know what day is it? What, Sir? Today is the start of Lent. It's Lent already? The importance of this day, according to the real Christian tradition, is reflecting on your self, turning back from your selfish ways, and sincerely accepting and repenting on your sins. And not giving up amidst every form of evil in your environment. And meat is not allowed. Just this once, Saint Paulo. Please tell Christ. We will eat meat and we will drink, don't worry, Baldo. Let us celebrate our arrival. That's great. Wait. I will just make an altar. They will tie us up so our waists will join together. Twin Gecko! They will make us wear costumes made in rubber, which resembles that of a gecko's body. And we also have tails. Then they will put glue on our hands, then they will plant items everywhere. Then we will put our hands on those and they will stick in our hands. All kinds of items from tin cans, clothes, leaves and anything the audience will throw. We pick them up, they will stick in our hands, and they will be happy with it, specially the kids. But there are also those who get scared. -I agree. -Well, they made our looks scary. Our mouths are always open and with a bit of fangs like that of a crocodile's. But our eyes should always be open like this. And Clown would always have a little introduction which goes like this: "Friends!" "You are about to see the funny Twin Geckos of Hugaw Island!" And then we will come out, crawling! Crawling from a sort of a... a makeshift hole in a tree. Then, applause! During the Galleon Trade... Wait. - Are you familiar with the Galleon Trade? - Yes, of course! You're underestimating Captain Teofilo's and my knowledge. He wouldn't become the village chief... if he's not smart, right? He's a Law graduate! - Sorry, sorry, Captain. - Go ahead with your story, Inggo. This story is my grandfather's, which also came from his grandfather. Galleon Trade lasted 250 years from 1565 to 1815. It is the Spanish government's monopoly. That will connect Manila to Acapulco, Mexico. It was just stopped because of the revolution in Mexico. According to my grandfather, during the Galleon Trade, the contrabands all go here in Hugaw Island. Before they arrive in Manila, they secretly go here just to drop the porcelain and other contraband products from America. That's why this has become the camp of smugglers. And then, the Chinese also brings their opium here which they supply to the upper class society people in Manila, Cuba, Mexico, Spain and the United States. Corruption became rampant among the Chinese, Spaniards and rich Malays. So what they did was, they spread this myth that this is the most dangerous island through the Punta Negro. That the Punta Negro waves eat people up, that Hugaw Island has the black horse curse, that the lepers were being brought here, and people afflicted with syphilis. But of course, those were just fabricated by smugglers and administrators of the Galleon Trade. Our island was destroyed by myths. That's why- the story about the Jar of Truth that is here in Hugaw Island? That is true. I'm after that that's why I've never left. I've been looking for that Jar of Truth. I need to find that. I need to break that. I know that one day... I will find that. I will find that Jar of Truth here. Here in Hugaw Island. Where are you off to? I'm heading this way. Where are you going, Captain? Going home. Okay. Fuck! Your gun! Put that in its holster! It might put us in danger. Bye. We have work to do tomorrow. We have a lot of things to do. I didn't know you have a job. Mother? Mother... Please go to Aling Quirina and Mariposa. Aling Quirina? This is Sir Paulo's money. These are his things. Mariposa... This is your father's money. Those are his things. Where is my father, Andres? Where is Paulo, Andres? Last night... Paulo, just for fun. Come. Let's demonstrate to Andres our opening act. Come! No, no. I've forgotten that already. Just for now. You will remember that. Come! It's like this. Geco, geco, geco… Hey, Paulo! Because of that act, we were able to tour in the Philippines! Right? If it were up to me, I'm happy with that. Yes. How old were we when the circus took us? I was in Grade three, you're in second grade. - Yes, I was in Grade two. - We were young kids, then. I was eight years old. Then they turned us into The Twin Geckos, Andres! They made us The Twin Geckos! Clown went here in Hugaw Island. He arrived in the island aboard a motorboat. In a clown costume He looks funny and scary at the same time. He said, "Listen up, cuckolds, assholes and jerks! Disabled people and smelly ones!" He went tumbling. Showed some magic tricks. There! A white dove flew! Indeed. One after the other. Four white doves. We were all looking up! And Clown said, "Calling all the children here in Hugaw Island! Bring them all here in front! You will earn money!" What did we do, Paulo? We lined up. He stared at us, he even smelled us, and poked our ears and noses. And, he was tickling us in our armpits. And, he pulled us both. Then he said, "You two, would be The Twin Geckos! Come with me!" That is our story, Andres. That's when they began calling us The Twin Geckos. We grew up in the circus. We get to go home here in Hugaw Island when we're done touring the Philippines. We really looked like geckos. We had glues in our hands. But of course it's fake. It was fun. Fun. But it was so sad. I always look for my father, my mother and my siblings. They were cruel. Especially that Clown. If we don't do what he wants us to do, he whips us! He doesn't feed us! But one night... What, Paulo? Nothing. I just thought, we've worked for nine years in the circus. At the fair. But, nothing happened. We still ended up here in Hugaw Island. Our childhood were destroyed. Our lives were destroyed. Why are you saying our lives were destroyed? Isn't it true? Where are we now, Baldomero? We're like rats digging up golds! For our age, we're still miserable like this! We're among those who weren't able to escape Hugaw Island! This is all your fault, Baldo! Wait a second! Why is it my fault, Paulo? Don't you remember anymore? Or- you're trying hard not to remember it? Me? I've never forgotten about it! What have you not forgotten? One night... while we were about to sleep... you whispered this to me: "Paulo, the only way we could escape this hell is..." What? "..is to kill Clown!" That's not true! That's not true! So one night, we had him drink alcohol. We gave him a girl. And, there... In the Tagum forest, we butchered him. That's not true! - We didn't do that! - That is true, Baldomero! We killed Clown! We chopped him to pieces like a pig! Fuck, Baldomero! We chopped his body to pieces and threw them in the river! We did that, Baldomero. Up until now, it's still in my head and in my soul. We chopped Clown... - That's not true! - We chopped Clown into pieces! So, there, Andres. That is our secret. Don't believe him! He just made them up! He just made them up! Finally! Finally! Our secret is now out, Baldomero! - That's not true! Fuck you, Clown! Fuck you... Mariposa... I'm asking for your forgiveness. I blacked out I just wanted to save Sir Paulo that's why I did that to your father. Aling Quirina... I'm sorry. I wasn't able to save Sir Paulo. I buried their bodies by the cliffside. They're buried beside each other. I'm asking you. May we keep this as a secret? Mariposa... Dadong! Here, some money. Please give that to Captain. Andres. Inggo. Betel nut? No, thanks. I'm busy. There's plenty. Take it. Andres. Share some of your money. I don't have money, Inggo. You went mining in Inawayan in three months. How's that possible? That's not true. I was in Roxas. You know that my sister is sick. Someone saw you in Inawayan. You were with Sir Baldo and Sir Paulo. Well, whoever told you that, is some liar. Where is Sir Baldo and Sir Paulo? I repeat: I just came from Roxas. Aren't they around? Give me money. I don't have money, Inggo. I'm asking you nicely. If you give me money now, I won't ask again. I told you I don't have money. If you want money, join me in Claveria. What will I do there? They need plenty of men to work at the docks. Me? Some porter? Never mind! Come on. Andres, give me money. Hey. Give me money. A gift of sorts. I said I don't have any! Okay, then. None. None. Nothing for Inggo. None, none, none! Hey! What the hell, Inggo! Lazy bastard. Go away! Mother, The three white chickens are missing. I can't find them. A letter from brother-in-law Ninoy. Mother, Ninoy said, Sister Naty's hospital bills has now reached seventy five thousand. For now, I can only give them twenty five thousand. I'll go there next week. I'll go to Roxas. I'll visit Sister Naty and hand them the money. After that... I'll head straight to Claveria. There's work there. At the pier. The money I'll save will all be given to Sister Naty and Ninoy. Mother, I'll strive to find a place for us there. Either in Roxas or Claveria. Come what may. Aling Quirina! Hey. Good day! Got something to eat there, Aling Quirina? The food's got maggots already! Where's Sir Paulo? He is dead. He is dead! Dead? Andres killed him! My lucky day. Money's everywhere. Give me that. Give it to me! Good morning! Sir Nanding? Sir Nanding? - Andres! - Sir Nanding! I brought cigarettes for you. Thank you, Andres. This cigarette is good. Thank you, Andres. You know anything about what happened to Peping? None, Andres. How about Aling Imang? How about the Perez siblings? Sarge Sadiwa! Good day! Jesus is dead today, Inggo. What devil brought you here? If you just want to eat, no. This is just for me. You are mistaken, Sarge. What's wrong with that? It's just Holy Thursday. - Is that so? - Jesus will die the day after tomorrow. Okay, then. Eat. Inggo. If you'll only bring speculations and fake news, I don't want those. I don't have time for you. This is far more interesting than real news, Sarge. It goes like this: - Inggo! - Yes? Go ahead. Bring that butterfly woman! She's not a butterfly! Turtle! Aling Mamay. Child of the mountain breeze Blood will give birth to justice to a new land. Fertile light Shining on the grave in the arms of Manawan in the cries of Tanawan. You will never be forgotten In the leaves of history Hundred years may pass Infinite grief Infinite grief Infinite grief Have a safe journey. You will surely arrive in our mountain abode by morning. When will you come with us, my child? I will stay here in the valley for the meantime. The souls of Tanawan and Manawan are still here. And so does our ancestors. Please take care. Aling Mamay... I'll go ahead. This the herbal medicine for your mother. Thank you, Ma'am. Thank you for attending the commemoration for Tanawan and Manawan, Andres. Manawan is my childhood friend. They share the same fate as my brother Peping. I'll go ahead. I will return tomorrow. I will help you look for roots. May our ancestors favor upon you, Andres. By the way, Mariposa. Your father requested me to send a telegram to your uncle so he would come and get you. How are you, Mariposa? Fine, Ma'am. Did your father arrive already? I'll prepare something for you- I'll give you rice cakes, okay? No need, Ma'am. I'll just get the jar. But why, Mariposa? The jar was given to me by your late mother. I'll get the jar. What will you do with it? I will just get it. I need it. Okay then. Let me help you, Mariposa! Mariposa! Mariposa! Let me ask you something! Mariposa... You know something about the death of my brother Peping? I know you two are close. Mariposa! I am begging you. I demand to know the truth. Let's go, Ma'am. Aling Mamay? When will you live in the mountain? I do want to go back there. I know it's peaceful there. But just like you, I'm tormented by what they've done to us. Even in my dreams, I'm being chased by the wails of my husband and my child and others they've killed in my tribe. They were slaughtered like pigs. They even burned our huts. I'll stay here in the plains until I've learned the truth, Andres. You heard anything yet? Even with what happened with my brother Peping? How about the case of Aling Imang? There's no answer, Andres. The people in this island are mute. Fear had taken over. Let's go, Ramon. We need to talk, Turtle Mariposa. You're not listening well, are you? I've been telling you the story three times. Hey. Our stories should match, okay? Because we will build a case against Andres. That chatter box with a loud voice, greedy and intrusive! And you need to avenge the death of your father, right? You want to get even, right? Now tell me the story. When... Andres came... from.... from... Inawayan! From- Inawayan, he asked his mother to go here. His mother went here in the house. She said... Andres killed my father. And Sir Paulo... in the forest. And he took their money. But he didn't mean to kill- What the hell! Just tell them what I instructed you to say! Don't add anything on it, fuck! Continue. From... From... Inawayan, Andres asked his mother to come here in our house. His mother went here in our house. She said that Andres killed my father. And Sir Paulo. In the forest. He took their money. Andres killed my father. He hit my father in the head using a rock. He took the money of my father. Andres killed Sir Paulo. He hit Sir Paulo in the head using a rock. He took the money of Sir Paulo. Very good! Very good! Now- where's the money from Andres which you mentioned? That's my money. Bitch! Hey. You want me to slash your neck right now? Right now? Get it. C'mon, get it! Here. For your needs. Thou shall not kill. Honor thy father and mother Thou shall not steal. Sir Melchor! Can you still do it? I'll bring you to your place. Can you walk from here, Sir? Yes. Thank you, Andres. Faster! Easy, Inggo. You know how slow she is. Sorry, I forgot! How about you, Mariposa? What's your story? Hey. Speak up. Tell them your story. Andres killed your father, right? Last Tuesday... Mother, forgive me. I killed Sir Baldo and Sir Paulo. I needed to do that for the medication of my older sister. Why, Ma'am? Our palms stuck at her, and there, she crapped. Another shot! Hey, Andres. You're making us drunk. The shots are being given fast. I'm just enjoying your company. Lessen that enjoyment, then. You're making us drunk. - Our last show was in Tagbilaran. - Yes, in Bohol. Andres? Andres! Sir Nanding! Sir Nanding! Leave this island now, Andres. The soonest time possible. But why? I heard the rumours in town. The Captain and Sergeant are targeting you. Inggo and Mariposa were seen in the precinct. - Mariposa? - Yes! She had a confession about you. I'm not afraid of them, Sir Nanding. Leave now, Andres. Please leave. Mother. Mother... Start packing. I will send you to the port. Go to Roxas. But, why? Stay with Big Sister. What about you? I'll follow. After going to Claveria, I will join you. I won't leave you here. Come with me tomorrow. Stop investigating. It will get you in trouble. Mother, pack your stuff. I will send you to the port tomorrow. Andres Hanibal! You are surrounded! Get out and surrender peacefully! Why, Sarge? We are arresting you for killing of the following: Baldomero Catabay! Quirina Catabay! Paulo Homero! That's not true! I already gave your share to Dadong, Captain! Sarge! What more do you need from me? Almost nothing's left from my money! Sarge! Don't, Chief! Sarge! Sarge!
