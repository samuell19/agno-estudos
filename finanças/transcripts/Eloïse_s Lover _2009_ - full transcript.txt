Women also want to have fun. He sucks. -I should have ended it long ago. It's the hormones. Explains the behaviour and all the hair. Look, your armpit hair. Hey, stop it. Apropos guys... Check out him! -Shit, he saw us. He's looking this way. He likes you. -nonsense. You're not his type. Last year he dated an older woman. Bullshit! That's just your imagination. -It's true.

See you. Bye. -Bye. ''Hello girls. Hello Asia.'' Very obvious. I told you. He asks you to the cinema. - We all go. For us, friends stick together. Dani is cute too. Here comes the freak. She's weird. Her sect worships aliens. She took too many drugs and went psycho. That's why people avoid her. They're afraid she'll kill somebody. Wouldn't be the first time i bet. -Bullshit. Why? -She's not like that. How do you know? She had an abortion. -But she's a lesbian! Maybe she was raped. Maybe... in her sect. Let's go. l have to go home. What time is it? 8.30.

About 10. l'll let you know. -Okay. See you. -Bye. Make a goal! Or two. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry. -Thanks. ART STUDENT SEEKS MODEL 8. APRIL, ROOM 203, 5.30PM. Hello. Hello. Are you here for the job? -Yes, but I didn't know... Have you found a model? -No. You're the only one. l was just about to leave. Bye. -Wait. Aren't you here for the job? More out of curiosity. I don't want to model and definitely not... For me? That figures. Thanks for coming. See you. I thought you were leaving. l'll model for you. -l don't like wasting time. Me neither. l don't know why I came. But... But for once in my life I want to do something impulsive. l'll model for you. It was the book. -What book? The one you read at the cafe. It brought me here. Fine, let's do something impulsive! Cheers. -Cheers. To us! To my goals. -Not again! Make him stop drinking or he won't shut up. Not like you have anything else to do. What? The world is my oyster. This is a complete waste of time. l should go hunting. And you are the one's always complaining about guys? -I like guys, a lot. You can be glad she's my friend because if she wasn't... We shouldn't drink so much. Lesbians. Ew. Lesbians had bad experiences with guys. Or they are ugly, like those two. Show them a real man. 3 women are enough. -You'd like that, would you? If there was any good music we could dance Gin & Tonic. Keep doing that and you'll find oil. Sorry. -It's ok. Did you have fun yesterday? -Too much fun. I can tell. Tell me what to do and when to come. Let's postpone it. You're in a bad mood. It's a waste of time. -No. Wait. I want to talk. I just had a shit night. It's like, men are dogs. That's nothing compared to what women are capable of. And we even think it's something good. -Rivalry and Jealousy. No, It's not jealousy. It's envy. You want to be better than others and have what's theirs. How do you do it? -What? They were talking about you at school. I didn't believe any of it, but I couldn't have handled it. How were you able to take all the shit? I cried secretly. -Really? Sure! What do you think I'm made of? Sure it hurt. The ones who are closest hurt you the most. That's just a quickie. Excuse me. My daughter's been in the ER for two hours. Why does it take so long? -Where is she? Room 314. -Let's see... 3 hour surgery. They should be finished soon. Don't worry. The doctor will be here soon. Thanks. -You're welcome. Are you still together with Nat? -For almost a year. He seems nice. -He's very loving. What are you studying? -Architecture. That's why you have the folder with you. l was wondering. You're drawing? -Yes, but other stuff. Do you know her? -No. Do you smile at strangers? No. Why? Just curious. Asia. The other day at the disco... I did something wrong... l kissed Erika. I don't know why. But I want to be honest with you. It was stupid and I'm sorry. You should know. Forgive me. -I already knew. Did she tell you? -No, I saw you. Shit. Why didn't you say something? -I didn't know what to say. Shit, I'm so sorry. -Me too. Do you forgive me? -I already did. It wasn't... First it was hard but now it's okay. Thanks for being honest. -Hit me! What? -I deserve it. Don't be stupid! I wont hit you. Come here. I love you. I will never hurt you again. Thanks. -You're welcome. ldiot! I have something for you. What is it? My date canceled. They're for tomorrow. For me? -Yes. Have a nice evening with Nathaniel. Why don't you go with someone else? They must have been expensive. -Take them! No, give them to a friend. Don't worry. I'm glad if you two go. I don't know what to say. That you're looking forward to it. Ballet? Tonight? I don't know. It will be great. I... -What? I was going to watch the game. There's a game every week. This is something different for a change. Besides, you owe me one. Since when do you like ballet? No. Okay. This one's great. -Yes. It doesn't look good on you. I don't want to buy anything. -Then what are you doing here? l'm here with friends. -Yeah. Nora and Erika, I know. You don't like them, don't you? What brings you here? -My latest date. The ballet one. How was it? Great. -Really? I haven't seen this kind of ballet before. It was great. -I knew you'd like it. And did Nathaniel like it? -Yes, but... You should have gone. -It's okay. I'm glad you liked it. Nora wants to show you the pants. Coming. See you. -Sure. Bye. -Bye. Bye. Do you like it, Asia? -Looks good on you. Does my butt look fat in it? Asia, what do you think? -I would buy it. Yes? Okay. Erika, show Asia the lovely earrings you bought. Did you find something, Asia? -No. She's my daughter. How is she? The doctor will be here soon. -How is she? I'll show you to her room, the doctor will explain everything. Hello. -Hello. How do I look? -Great. Or should I wear the grey shirt? -You look nice. l don't know... -It's only dinner, Nat. l'm going to meet your family. I want to make a good impression. -With your barn door open? What? -Just a joke. You look nice. Come on, they are waiting. Hello. -Hello. This is Asia's grandfather. -Nice to meet you. Hello. -Hello. This is my sister. Let's sit. Pick a menu! -Any? -Yes. I'll take this one. Champagne? -I already had 3. Maybe Nat. ls it yours ? -Yes, thanks. What are you doing here all alone? -Getting some fresh air. I put it here. She seems to like him. -Yes. More champagne? -One for you, one for you. Like hens and the cock of the roost. Listen to them cackling. Especially your grandma. She's the worst. Women. As if he's part of the family. I'll be disinherited if I leave him. But you are with him. And if you want to end it, it's your choice... and only yours. l'll check what Asia is doing. What are you doing? You're missing some great stories. I know them all. -There's still some cake to eat! Your family is very nice. -Only at the beginning. Come on in. -I like it here. But here you are alone. Come on! No, Nat, later. Okay. But soon! She doesn't want to come. -Typical. Asia, do you know the noise of charcoal on paper? What? -You'll see. Listen! Sounds like always. But have you ever really concentrated while listening? What do you mean? Close your eyes. -Why? Close your eyes! Forget everything around you, okay? Even forget yourself! Only the charcoal exists. Imagine the lines I draw. You hear the noise. What do you feel? What do you feel? -Your heart. Now hear through my hand! -That's impossible. Can't pigeons hear music? -l don't think so. But they can. Not with this... But with that. Like this. With their whole body. They don't need to hear it to enjoy it. They just feel it. Do you feel my heart? Yes. Close your eyes! How are the lines? Fine... and curved. Like helixes. What else do you hear? A clock. -What else? Steps. -How many people? Two, no, three people. They are laughing. It's 3 girls. They are in the hallway. Music. I hear music. A piano. Play for me! The charcoal. And your... breath. It's strange to model. -l'm used to it. My parents are photographers. We used to travel around. New people, new places... we never spent more than 6 month in one place. Then something happened that doesn't go along with this kind of lifestyle. l fell in love. I was 13 and fell deeply in love. And when I had to leave, I thought I was going to die. They say travellers should fall in love with the landscape, not people. Now I understand why. After that I stayed with my grandmother and led a normal life. For the first time I went to the same school for a whole year. Are your parents still travelling? -Yes. They are in Mexico at the moment. They love their lives. And your parents? They are divorced. I live with my mother. Do you visit your father? He's dead. Car accident. Keep everything. l can't do that. -But Senora... I don't want to remember him. He hurt us. I need your signature. We'll take care of things then. -All right. Asia! Asia! Hello, Erika. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Excellent! Your turn. Excellent, Asia. Great! -Great! Fill it up! That's it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Marvelous! Whos turn is it? Nora. Go, show em! On 3! 1, 2, 3! l'm out. What? -Nothing. Are you crazy? Yes? Whose turn is it? Wait, please. Asia! It's for you. Eloise. Who is she? -A friend from University. Yes? -Hello. Hello. -What are you doing? Studying. I want to ask you something. -What? The pictures of you are great, but I have to go one step further and draw more than your hands. What do you mean? -I want to draw you naked. Uh... Completely naked? Yes. Me? -Sure, if you let me. l don't know... l don't know. Think about it and we'll talk about it later, okay? Okay. l'll come back to you in a few days. -okay. How are you? Fine. Talk to you later. Right. Bye. -Bye. I have a sore throat, Angina. Shit. -I have to cancel. It's okay. Stay in bed and get well soon. Absolutely. Is your mother already gone? -Since morning. Shit, a whole weekend for us and I get sick. Get some rest! Shall I come over? That would be great but I don't want you to catch the infection. Get some rest, okay? -Okay. A kiss. -Hey... What? -l love you. Love you too. Bye. -Bye. Eloise? It's Asia. Asia, come on! -l can't. Forget the skirt! Come on! There's one thing I miss about traveling. What? -The stars. Everywhere I went there were thousands of stars in the sky. Great. No matter where I was. I only had to look up, and there they were waiting. I've rarely seen such a beautiful sky. Where does your name come from? -My mother is french. And yours? -My father's first girlfriend. Was it okay for your mother? -She didn't know. He asked me to keep it a secret. I'm cold. -Me too. I'll show you something you don't know. Hello. -Come in! Thanks. Asun. Hello, cutie. and who's that? -Asia. Hello, Asia. -Hello. Very pretty! What do you want to drink? l'll take a Kahuna Blue. -What's that? Something special. Try it! -ls it strong? Sometimes you should take risks without thinking. You want one? -Okay, give me one. That's why I like you. The other day I met your friend. A blonde, can't remember her name. Blonde? You mean Sara? Yes, she didn't say hello. A large guy was with her, well groomed and well dressed. Doesn't matter. -I don't know him. 2 Kahuna Blues. Enjoy. I like it here. -The bar is cool. Where do you go with Nathaniel? -Cinema, restaurant. The usual. We never go to bars. Did you take her here? -Who? The ballet one. She was pretty. Her, I took right into my bed. Asun, can we have 2 more? -Sure. Another one? -Sure. Thanks. You're the best. -Everyone keep saying that. Cheers. You know what I'm in the mood for? -What? Swimming. -Now? Where? Have you ever been to a fancy hotel? Do you know the story of the Whale Kiss? A blue whale fell in love with the moon. When the other whales were looking out for plankton, he was at the surface watching the moon. He was sad. The moon seemed to be beyond his reach. The whale was only a spot in the ocean and the moon didn't see him. The whale cried and cried. One night he gathered all his strength and swam to the bottom of the ocean. Then he jumped up higher than anyone else. But the moon was too far away, he would never reach it. So he blew a kiss to him. The kiss was so full of love, the next night a reflection of the moon appeared on the spot. Let's go! You want to come in? -No, better not. Not like this. Bye. Eloise. Eloise. Morning. Don't worry. In the morning our vision is always much clearer. I'd like to take a shower before I leave. Sure, there are clean towels in the bathroom cabinet. I'll fix breakfast. You have to eat something before you leave. Thanks. You want a hair dryer? I don't use a hair dryer. I put the towel in the basket. Yes, it's the clothes basket. l'd better leave now. You haven't eaten anything. -l'm not hungry. Yes? Hello? Hello? Who is it? Hello? I have sole custody. -I have the right to see her. No. -You can't stop me. I'll call the police. I want to tell her goodbye. -You're disgusting. Let me in! Asia, goodbye. l'll be back. -No, the judge... Just because he believes your lies doesn't mean they are true. I shouldn't have said that. You know why I'm leaving? -You don't love me anymore. No, sweetie, I'll always love you. You are my precious. That's enough. Leave! -Wait. Fuck off! -l'll be back soon. After the lies are cleared. I promise. Wait, Papa. l love you. l love you too. Leave! l hate you. l've never felt something like this. l'm scared. l know. l know that feeling. -I... l'm confused. Yes? Hello, Nathaniel. No, she's not. I thought she was at your place. A part of me tells me it's not right. I'm not as brave as you. That's not the point. It's about what you want. And be happy. I don't know what I want. -Of course. When I woke up next to you I felt dirty. I was disgusted, couldn't look at you. It was very intense. But when you weren't there, I missed you. l wanted you to be here with me. Give me some time, I have to deal with things. I came to apologize and tell you I had a great time on friday. Me too. Mama, I thought you weren't here. What are you doing here in the dark? Waiting for you. This is for you. For me? What is it? Have a look! Wow, this is great! Try it on! Nathaniel called. It's suposed to be a surprise. You're going to the ballet next saturday to celebrate your anniversary. He told me you like ballet. Afterwards you're going out for dinner. The dress is perfect for this. Mama... -Try it on! Later. -Don't you like it? Of course. -You're going to look great. Mama. -What? No, I... -What? He's a good boy. He loves you. He loves you very much. Saturday will be perfect. Okay? Yes, Mama. Here. What do you want to eat? I don't care. Just anything. Tomorrow I'm going to dump Nat. Are you sure? No. But I don't want to find out I was wrong when it's too late. That I wanted something else. What are you going to tell him? l don't know yet. I don't have the courage to tell him about us. l love you. You look great. Have fun. -We will. Bye, Mama. -Bye. Bye. Is it Eloise? Hello. Let's get to the point. You will not see my daughter again. -And you are going to stop me? Yes. Your daughter is old enough to know what she wants. l'm her mother. That's none of your business. I won't allow it. -Her being happy? I feel sorry for you. A fucking reputation is more important to you than your daughter's happiness. Happiness? -A foreign word for you. Why did you forget your bag? -See you in a bit! l'm waiting. I know what's good for my daughter. Marry someone she doesn't love? Produce children and become you? Keep away from her! -That's her decision. You fucking... -Bitch? Maybe. But Asia and I, we love each other. You can't change that. Fuck off! Fuck off! Forget her, Asia. -What happened? What? It's better that way. Come on! -No. No. Come back, Asia! If you go with her you are not welcome here anymore. Asia. Hey, Asia! Asia, wait! Asia! Wait. I'm really sorry, Senora. I'm really sorry. Asia!
