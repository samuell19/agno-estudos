You know, how much I don't like to call Felix. Yeah, tomorrow I'll stop by. Have a good night. Okay, have a good night. Jake, we left a little bit of money for you, and dad left you a gift. Love, mom and dad. Awe, isn't that nice, Jake? Let's see what your dad got you. Wow, look at that thing. What are you gonna do with that, Jake? Stop messing around. Let's get started. Hi, I'm calling about the $200 special. It's tonight only, right? Yeah, I'm 21. I live on 14th Street. It's the Village East End. Yeah, I live on the fifth floor, room 503.

Have a good night. Have a good night. What's the matter, Jake? Wondering what games I'm playing with you? Wondering why you're seeing your sister during sex? It's quite simple. We need something more. I'm talking about a greater high, something so fucked up but it feels so good. Where are you going? This won't do. The usual's not gonna be enough anymore. You're going to be disappointed. Can I help you? Yeah, I was wondering if I could have a session? Did you schedule an appointment? No, but I have money. How old are you? 22. Can I see your ID? Yeah. All right. Come on in. Take your shoes off. I take my money upfront. It's the $100 special today only, right? That's right. Alright, baby, couple of ground rules to go over before we get started. This session is for one hour. When the hour is over, you must go. Um, as far as, me I'm open to anything, golden showers, pegging, everything is fair game to me. You can pick your own safe word. I don't want a safe word. Baby, I think... Trust me. Alright, well, I wasn't expecting you, so I have to get into custom. But I'll be right back. Make yourself at home. Jake, what are you doing here? Why waste your money? This isn't good enough anymore. She's not Molly, Jake. Can't you see I'm trying to help you? Can't you see what I'm trying to do? I'm talking about something better. I wouldn't do anything to hurt you, Jake. You believe me, don't you, Jake? Alright, have your fun. But this won't change anything. You'll see. I'm not going away, Jake. I promise you that. Have you been a bad boy? Yes, mistress. Take your shirt off. Yes, mistress. Throw it on the floor. Yes, mistress. Get on your knees. Yes, mistress. So, you've been a bad boy? Yes, mistress. And you're a dirty little bitch, who needs to be punished! - Yes, mistress! - Say it! I'm a dirty little bitch, who needs to be punished! Good. You don't mind this, do you? You like it, don't you? Oh, yeah. Yes, mistress. Ah, ah, ah. Fucking pathetic. Yes, mistress. Yes, mistress, louder! Yes, mistress! Oh, I'm sorry does that hurt? Does that hurt? - Oh. - Oh. I'm gonna have fun with you. Yes, mistress. Yes, mistress, louder! Yes, mistress! - I can't fucking hear you, you pathetic piece of shit. Yes, mistress! Are you ready to be punished, slave? - Oh, yes, mistress! - I can't fucking hear you! Yes, mistress! Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't get you off, but you just didn't seem that into it. It's all right. BDSM isn't for everybody. It wasn't my first time. Bye. See, Jake, what did I tell you? We need something new, something more, the ultimate high, your sister Jake. You're supposed to pick her up, right? That's perfect. Come on go see your sister, Jake. Jake. Oh, I'm sorry. Jake? Yeah. You don't remember us, Elizabeth, Chris, Korab from school? Oh, yeah. How have you guys been? Better than you, at least by the looks of it. Yeah, what the hell happened to your eye, man? Oh, it's a long story. What are you guys up to though? We were just gonna go grab something. You come with us. I was about to... I was about to go somewhere. Come on. Neither of you are gonna ask him why he just blew us all off? I mean, look, I don't wanna start any shit in a restaurant, but we have a right to know. What do you wanna know? We wanna know why you just stopped coming to school? Why you just dropped out without telling anyone, not your professors, not your friends, not me, who I thought was your best friend, not even Monica, bro, Monica, your fucking girlfriend? It's one thing to treat us like dog shit, but your girlfriend, that's fucked up. And if neither of them were gonna say anything, then I had to let you know how disrespectful that was to the people that thought they meant something to you. I mean, I don't know what you want me to say. I mean, tell me at least you had a good reason for all it. All I can say is I had my reasons. If that's not good enough, I don't know what to tell you. That's all you have to say? I mean, I don't know what you want me to say. This fucking guy, man. I don't know. I don't know what you guys want me to say. Are you okay? I mean, yeah, my eye. No, it's not just your eye. Frankly, you look like shit. What's the real reason you dropped out of school, drugs? I just wanted other things. Hey, Jake. I remembered this was your favorite. Why don't you come lick it off me? Jake. Yeah. Korab, was right. Something happened to you. Don't worry about them. Don't worry about your bitch of an ex, Jake. Didn't you hear? She's with some other guy. You're different, Jake, embrace it. Jake, don't. Jake don't remember her. Think about Molly. Embrace the high. Tell me a secret. I feel like I'm the luckiest guy in the world. Awe. Tell me a lie. I don't think you're the cutest boy I know. Cute. What's the matter with hot? Come on cute's cute, and you're cute. I mean, I guess, I'll take it. Tell me a lie. I don't love you or your family. You're not even trying. What can I say, I'm a happy guy. Tell me a secret. I wanna have your kids. Really? Uh-huh. How many will we have? Let's see, um, a boy. Definitely. Shut up. A boy and two girls. Three kids? I mean, I guess, I better get started on that boy. It's so the brother can look after his siblings, you know? Or in my case the sister look out for her brother. That sounds good to me. I'll be there. Good, 'cause I wouldn't want you anywhere else. I don't know if I can do this anymore, Jake. What do you mean? All you wanna do is watch porn. I mean, we can't even make love like a regular couple because it doesn't get your off enough. What's wrong with fucking with a porno on in the background? I'm just trying to spice things up. That's my point. You never used to call it fucking. It was always making love. Making love, fucking what's the difference? There is a difference, Jake. You used to like making love to me, and now all you wanna do is fuck. Yeah, it's me Jake. I know it's been a while. Can I come see you? I got a lot on my mind. I think, you can help. Alright, I'll be over soon. Sorry about the mess. It was my two siblings. I share the room with them till I get back on my feet. No, that's fine. So how the hell you been, man? I haven't seen you in forever. I'm actually not doin' so good. Just about to ask you about your eye. What happened, you got jumped on the way here or what? Oh, yeah, my eye it's nothing. Don't worry about it. You not back in the life? Jake, come on, man. How long? Been back in for a while. I should've known I haven't seen you at the meetings in a while. What you want me to sponsor you back and get you in, what? No, I was actually hoping you had had something to sort me out. Sort you out? You mean like pills? Yeah, I need something, man. Let me see. Now describe to me what's going on. Well, it's like I can't control my thoughts. It's like my brain is trying to get me to do crazier and crazier sexual shit, shit I would never do. I can't get off otherwise. Yeah, it's a sexual high. The brain is a funny thing, my friend. Here take this. What is it? It's some good shit. I'm a hit it myself, and it's as small as an everyday. Yeah, but you haven't told me what it is. It's a form of psychedelic. You'll see some weird shit. But it'll stop your mind from fuckin' with you even for a little bit. Yeah, listen, that's the best I can do, my friend. Alright, man, I really appreciate it. Yeah, don't worry about it. I don't have much money to pay you. Man, don't worry about it. This is on the house. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Now where you headed? I was thinking about heading down to... I was thinking headin' over to the Bowery. The fucking bar. Jake, why would you wanna go down there? You know you only hurting yourself, right? Hey, man, listen I really do appreciate this, the stuff, I mean. It was good seeing you. I think, I'm gonna be out though. Alright, Jake, take it easy man. Don't be a stranger, okay? All right. Alright, thanks again. Hey, Jake, you be safe, man. Take care of yourself. Doesn't that feel good, baby? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Talent Show. I can see we have a packed house tonight. Either way, let's get this show on the road, huh? I'm going to bring out your first contestant of the evening. Her talent is singing, and she's recently single. You know what that means guys, especially you. Please give a nice round of applause for Ms. Molly. Thank you. One more time a nice round of applause for the lovely Ms. Molly. Singing about swinging. Now who's our next lucky contestant? How about you, sir? Would you like to come on up here and show us your talent? What's your name? It's Jake. Jake. Take it away. How's everybody doin'? I'm not really good at this sort of thing. I'm not sure what I should do. Do you sing? No, I don't. You don't have to sing. What's your talent? I don't really have one. Sure you do. Your cock. Show them your cock. It's why you're here, isn't it? Ladies and gentlemen, once again give it up for Jake. Tough crowd, huh? Listen, Jake. Silence! We have a consolation prize for you, something that'll make you feel a little better. Come here, Jake. Come to me. Come on. Come on, Jake. You know you want to. Come to me. Hey, man, are you okay? You seem a little spaced out. Come with me there's something I think you'll like. How you ladies doin'? What do we have here? Who's this? He's my friend? Does he speak? He's a little fucked up. I don't know what drugs he took, but he's not doin' too good. He just needs you ladies to wake him up. We can do that. Right girls? Definitely. Against the wall. Take off your jacket and your shirt. See this whip. We gonna use this on you. Turn around. How does that feel? Feels good. Is this what you want? Yes. Say it. Yes! You like being dominated by three women? Yes, I do. You like being our property? Yes! Good. Now hit her. Hit her now, slave. Harder! Now let's put him in his place. You are weak. Weak. You are helpless. Nobody can save you. Look at him. Hey, it's just me. I guess you forget to pick me up at the station. Don't worry I won't tell mom. I'm headed to the hotel to unpack and get settled in. You should definitely come by later if you have time. I texted you the address and the number. Hope to see you soon. Love you, bye. Wild night, huh? Yeah. Who was that on the phone? Girlfriend doesn't know about your other life. It was my sister, actually. Even better. I'm Erdy. Jake. Saw you in there. You seemed to be having a good time. How long you been coming here? A while. Yeah, me too. I like it here. You can pretty much find anything you want here. I like finding new people. How come I didn't, uh... How come I didn't see you engaging with the others? Sex really isn't my thing. After a while, your mind picks something that really gets you and itself off. It sticks with it, at least that's what I think anyway. What's your thing? Well, you could follow me and find out. Follow you where? I got a place near here. You wanna walk over there with me? All right. No, no this way. Shelly, this is? - Jake. - Jake. Jake, Shelly. Oh, what a handsome young man. Yeah, isn't he? Can I get you anything, Jake? Nah, I'm fine. So, if you don't mind my asking, what am I doing here? Isn't it obvious? You're gonna fuck my wife, and I'm gonna watch. Oh, he's shy. Why don't you put on some music? Great idea. Anything in particular, Jake? It's like the perfect balance between joy and sadness. Well, Jake, let's get started. You don't have to worry, Jake. Nobody's gonna judge you here. Now pull her to face me. I wanna see my slut wife's face. Pull her, pull her hair back. Yeah. Now start fucking her. Hard. Harder. Harder. Harder. Harder. Fuck my slut wife harder. Yeah. Jake, look at you. You didn't think a pill and a Coke will keep me away for good, did you? You know what you have to do. Now go do it. Go in and take a peek, Jake. You know you want to. Jake, don't feel guilty. It's going to feel so good. Awe, it's gonna be the ultimate high. Hey. Baby brother, hi. You left the door open. Yeah, I figured you might come. How did you know? Well, who wouldn't wanna see his big sister after two whole years. How do I look? You look good. Yeah, I lost 10 pounds since you last saw me. Okay, let me go get changed. I'll be right back. Oh, my god! I can't believe I'm finally back in New York City. She does look good, doesn't she, Jake. You should've taken a peek earlier. I bet she looks good naked. No, Jake, we're not going anywhere. Don't even think about leaving. We're too close now. I tell you Colorado so boring. I can't believe I moved out there for that asshole. Hey, what's wrong? Nothing I... I just have a headache, all right. Oh, okay. Well, come sit with me. So, little brother, what's new with you? Nothing much, just keeping busy. Okay. Did you fuck any cute girls lately? What? Were any of them as cute as me? Why do you wanna know that? You know why she wants to know that? It's just a question. I'm sorry to hear that you and Monica split up. She was so pretty. How long were you two together? Eight months. Wow, that's a pretty long time. Well, I guess we're both single now first me and Greg, then you and Monica. Why'd you guys break up anyway? Let's talk about you. What are you gonna do now that you're back in the city? I'm not sure. Probably go try to get laid, first and foremost. See, I told you. Are you fucking with me? No. Oh, wait, I almost forget. I almost forget. I got you something. Happy belated birthday. Thanks. Well, open it. Wanna know why it's blank? So you can get started on the next great American novel. I don't write anymore. Oh. Really, why not? I just lost the passion. Well, I'm sure you'll find something to do with it. What did mom and dad give you? Mom gave me money, and dad he gave me his hunting knife. Dad and his hunting. Yeah, I bet he probably missing you out there. Look at her neck. Doesn't that look good? I'm so mixed up right now. I should leave. If I stay, something bad's gonna happen. Jake, what do you mean? I can't control myself. Feel your dick getting hard? Jake. You want it. You want it 'cause I want it. You smell good. Well, thank you. But, Jake, you're really freaking me out. Embrace it, embrace the high. I'm sorry. I love you. I'm really sorry I have to do this. Do what? Jake. I just can't control myself. What do you mean? Jake. I'm sorry I have to. You have to understand. I have to. - Jake, what are you doing? Jake. Jake, stop it. Jake. Jake! Stop it, Jake! Jake, get off! Jake, stop it! Jake! Jake! Jake, stop it! Stop it, stop it! Jake, stop it. No. I love Monica. Fuck my wife. You just blew us all off. Everybody's got secrets. Wanna fuck me? What do you want? Monica. Monica, you in here? Jake. What are you doing here? Monica. I miss you. Jake, you really shouldn't be here. I have to tell you something. You have to listen to me. I'm fucked up. All I think about is sex. I can't stop it. I've done some bad things. Tonight I did something I can't take back. I raped Molly. What? I don't know why I did it. I can't help myself. I can't control myself. I think, I wanted to hurt myself. Jake, I don't know what's going on, and I don't know what you did. But, you clearly need help, and I can't be a part of it. Monica, I don't feel anything anymore. Jake, I have to go. Are you okay, who is this guy? It's just my ex. No, I'm fine. What's done is done, Jake. Tomorrow you will wake up, and we will do it all again just like we always do. This is who we are now. Everybody's left you, all these people in these photos, everybody you've ever known, everybody but me. And I will always be with you, Jake, always.
