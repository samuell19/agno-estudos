Nothing at all? -That's what they're saying. But the fact that he died at Susie Yang's place does concern me a bit. I'm having some doubts. -What doubts? I wanna know. I'm here to find out. -Don't know yet. But they do say that some drugs were found at the scene. -Those stinking liars. I mean, now that he's dead. -Don't get me wrong.
