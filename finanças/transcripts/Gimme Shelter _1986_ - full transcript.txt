A Million Films Presentation Exciting Eros: Hot Skin aka 'Gimme Shelter' - Very well, let's begin. - Yes. What's with Eiji? I just went to call him a little while ago, but the door was locked. He's being such a pain when it's his own birthday. It's my birthday too. Lately that boy just shuts himself away in his room right after coming home from school. - Shall I go call him? - Forget him. Just leave him alone. - He'll come show his face later. - You're right. Then let's toast. Father, before that... Ta-dah! Happy Birthay Eiji & Kiriko Happy birthday! Now let's toast. Cheers! - A top-up, father? - Thanks. - Seventeen years? It seems a long time, but it was short. - Yes. I was shocked when you were born in the rice paddy, but you caused your mother a lot of hardships as well.

Maybe it's better not to worry so much. Oh, it's already this hour? I think I'm going to be late tonight. But you just got back from the last business trip! I can't help it. It's my job. Okay, I'm off. Take care... It was delicious. I'll be back later. Have fun. Eiji, are you awake? Dinner is ready, so come and eat. Good job working late everyday. Let's work hard all day today, too.

"A synapse is the part where the tip of a nerve fiber, "called the axonal process, connects with another nerve fiber. "A single nerve fiber is connected with over 25,000 axonal fibers. "Impulse transmissions are received from there. "In the same way as other biological processes, "the operation of the impulse transmission system is partly electrical and partly chemical. "A certain stimulus excites a cell. A certain other one inhibits it. "The drugs strengthen and weaken both stimuli..." Do it... Do it more. More... Do you love me? Thanks... but I really hate kids like you! Mother... Whispering...
