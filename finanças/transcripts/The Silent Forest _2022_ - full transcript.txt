[birds chirping in distance] [♪♪♪] GROSSREITHER: Grimm! Are you deaf? Didn't you hear that? You have to watch out! She hasn't been in the forest for that long. Darn it! ANJA: Good evening, Mrs. Gruber. [indistinct TV chatter] [inhales, exhales] [♪♪♪] [birds chirping in distance] [taking deep breathes] Did you just see anyone? No, I think we're wrong. The map shows a spruce forest. I don't see that. So what now? Let's do it. [sighs] [hammering in distance] [foot falling] OBERMÜLLER: Anything wrong? Yes. Let's take another one. Another one? Yes. [hammering in distance] [foot falling] [Obermüller grunts] ANJA: Soil Profile: 112. Strong reaction to hydrochloric acid suggests unusual calcium deposition. [♪♪♪] [indistinct TV chatter in background] ANJA: Soil sample 14-32 with moderately moist silty loam without calcium. Except 25 + 26 in the Haingries. Here calcium and sediment layers in reverse order. [indistinct TV chatter in background] [dog barking in distance] [birds chirping in distance] Shh. Shh. [dog continues barking in background] [Anna groans] XAVIER: Mother. There's digging in the Haingries. [birds chirping in background] [hammering in distance] [♪♪♪] [wood creaking] XAVIER: Leave! [breathing shakily] Xavier... XAVIER: Go away! It's me, Anja Grimm [♪♪♪] [breathing shakily] [taking deep breathes] [knocking] ANJA: Mrs. Gollas? Waltraud? Yes? We are mapping the region around Neustadt and Weiden. Today we are working in the Leybach Forest. I know. WALTRAUD: You want some more? Thank you. Xavier just pointed his gun at me. What? Oh Lord! RUPERT: Xavier is nuts. You just have to shout at him. As if he was a cow. How is your mother doing? Fine. I left my gear in the Haingries. I don't want to go back alone. Where? The Haingries. I'll go with you. No. I'll go. May I use... Of course kid, I'll show you the way. I still remember, thank you. [gulps] [indistinct chatter] [water flowing] RUPERT: I almost didn't recognize you. ANJA: What a pity. ...my internship ends next week. RUPERT: Just come along. We'll go to the house and I'll talk to him. He didn't recognize you, otherwise this would not have happened. We'll explain what you are doing. That'll be the end of it. [dog barking in distance] [door opens and closes] RUPERT: Anja! Anja! [♪♪♪] KONRAD: Thank you for now. If you recall anything else please call me. This is my number. We'll be in touch. [♪♪♪] [telephone rings] Dallmann, hello? Why? Yes, looking forward too. KONRAD: Hello Dad. How's Elisabeth? Well. GUSTAV: And the kids? KONRAD: Likewise. GUSTAV: Did they pick up Xavier already? KONRAD: He's at the forensic psychiatry. GUSTAV: Good. Can I ask you something? Sure. KONRAD: I found something strange in the old documents of Xavier. This thing with the teacher back then. He was a tourist. Gone missing. Hiking accident. A teacher from Munich. [clears throat] Johannes Grimm. Left Faunried to go on a hike on 18 August 1979. Last time he was ever seen. You quickly focused on Xavier put quite some pressure on him The first step is to investigate in all directions. After one day? The man had just barely been reported missing. There wasn't any suspicion. Are you going to teach me police work now? No, I'm wondering. No motive, no traces, no corpse, nothing. So what? KONRAD: Well, Xavier had threatened a young forest trainee in the Haingries with a gun, last week. And she's the daughter of this lost teacher Johannes Grimm. Who cares? We had two problems back then. The teacher was the less important one. We had this damn state visit. The Italian president and Franz Josef Strauß in Flossenbürg. It got worse every day. State Security guys calling all the time with new instructions So? What's the point? GUSTAV: Xavier ran around in the woods with his shotgun back then. As a precaution, we had him arrested for a few days Precautionary? Without any reasonable suspicion? A madman is always suspicious, no? GROSSREITHER: This incident with Xavier must have been very tough for you. I could instate you elsewhere, that may be better. I'm alright. Why did you even go back to the Haingries? Obermüller said you had finished there. There was a strange soil profile. Where? In the clearing. You mapped a clearing? Yes. We don't map lots when there is no forest. I found top soil at 80 cm and calcium at 120. Who digs so deep to make a hunting clearing? Miss Grimm, I appreciate your thoroughness, but we are not at university. I know you want to become a soil scientist but if you go on like this, our forest will not be mapped in a hundred years. Want candy? No, thank you. GROSSREITHER: Have you shot anything yet? No. GROSSREITHER: Why don't you make a few kills? It's part of the job. Or do you have a problem with that? In the Haingries? It's private property. The boars don't give a damn about who owns what. Dallman can't keep up, so if you want? Of course not in the Haingries. In the area around it. [barking in distance] [gunshot] [coos in distance] [deep breathes] [grunts] [deep breathes] [taking deep breathes] [Anja groaning] [groans] [breathing shakily] [grunting] I hope it is urgent. We were already asleep. Good thing that one of us is not sleeping. This Grimm woman - how much longer will she be here? How should I know that. Ask Grossreither. I am not going to ask anyone. You make sure this cunt will be gone. Got it? Wait a minute, what's gotten into you? She must leave. Now. Why? And how? We are not discussing here, Konrad. Got it? Stop playing the super cop. You better watch out that your mushy brain doesn't ooze from your ears with all that questioning. The moment you find a bomb, what do you do? You clear the place and defuse it. You don't wait for someone to come along and set it off. And blow up the whole place, do you? This Grimm woman, as if she has a sixth sense. She reads the forest like none of us can. I knew right away that there was some foul play involved. All those interrogations of Xavier. This is about something completely different. [grunting] KONRAD: What can I do for you? I ask you to dig up the Haingries and look for my father's body. And I want to press charges. Charges? Against Xavier Leybach. For killing my father. Johannes Grimm. My father disappeared in these woods 20 years ago. I'm sure you heard about it. This is the spot where Xavier threatened me. The soil profile shows profound anomalies, unusually deep digging. I first thought I had made a mistake. Why didn't you tell me right away, that you spent your vacation here as a child? And that you and Xavier knew each other. He must have recognized you when he saw you there. Right? I was eight years old when he saw me the last time. Xavier was strange already back then, he only played with us children and avoided adults. For what reason or motive should Xavier have harmed your father. I mean, a soil anomaly is... Did he need a reason to smash his mother's skull? Or has he told you by now? My father had been responsible for the hunting area in the Haingries. And this wild meadow I do know quite well. My father set it up after the death of my mother. Long after 1981. If somebody really buried there that deep, as you say, wouldn't they find out? Especially if somebody dug that deep. I must talk to Xavier. Where is he? He is in a forensic mental institution. But... for now, only family members are allowed to see him. [foot falling] [door opens and closes] DOCTOR: You won't recognize him, He's looking more neat now. Don't be surprised, your uncle is slightly sedated. He can hear you, but probably won't react. NURSE: The door will remain open. I'll keep an eye on you. RUPERT: Hello Xavier! Just wanted to check how you are doing. Do you need anything? I'll get it for you. Xavier? [dog barking in distance] [birds chirping] [gunshot in distance] [laughing] So, have you learned to swim by now? Not particularly well. Didn't Lukas teach you back then? Where is he, anyway? In Zürich, works for some insurance company. That suits him. Never wanted to get his hands dirty. At least not with soil. Does he come back here sometimes? Every other Christmas or Easter. So you hold the ground? Looks like it. The devil will take the hindmost. It wasn't your decision? My parents can't manage on their own. So I got stuck. And you? How do you cope? I'm okay. It's just my mother. She never got over it. The worst thing is not that he is gone, it's uncertainty. GUSTAV: What are you doing? I was hunting here yesterday. I fell and lost my knife. You have to inform me if you do so. ANJA: You're right I'm sorry. GUSTAV: You have a good hand for four-legged friends Dallmann. ANJA: Grimm Anja, forestry intern. You're a fine one. GUSTAV: That's Iras, tracks down the wild boars like no other. You shot one yesterday? Yes. Grossreither is complaining that I don't hunt enough. Let him know, that I will clean the area in the next few weeks. The wild browsing is a shame. And stay away from the Haingries okay? Sure. [dog barking] ANJA: Unusual rush trace in the Haingries. Rushes are marsh plants. In the forest they are compaction indicators. They grow in old trail tracks and transport ways. [indistinct chatter] GUSTAV: Lenka, two Schnaps. Sorry for your loss. Thanks. Poor Anna... Anna, your grandmother, was a fine woman. What do you know? She was horrible with Xavier. And Alois was worse. They treated him like an animal. Don't sin against your grandparents, Rupert. Not everyone has the patience of an angel. Well, now at least everyone can make their peace. You'll see, in the end it will all have been a lucky break for you. A lucky break. Maybe for the bank. Why is that? Now you got the entire forest without a madman around. And the two farms. You can finally build that fairy tale theme park. Hansel and Gretel. The house of the witch and so forth. It'll be great. Except for my uncle's rampage, really bad for business. You visited him, didn't you? Did he say anything? He never talked. Besides, he's full with stuff that doesn't exist. Maybe he just wanted to redeem her. Redeem her? By ramming a spade through her brain. Holy mother Mary. The next Schnaps will be on me. Goodbye, Gustav. Goodbye, Rupert. [♪♪♪] ANJA: Soil disturbance in the Haingries on 6x4 meters. [indistinct chatter] OFFICER: Hello Gustav! [door opens and closes] GUSTAV: Stay seated. [slurps] [gulps] As shitty as back then. She was in the Haingries again. We better give her what she's searching for, so she stops searching for, what she shouldn't find out. Just leave. I have to report this. GUSTAV: Report? I might as well hang myself, if this comes out. And the village, the entire region? I don't want to deal with this. Get out! [knocking] We're in a meeting! What you expect from me is... GUSTAV: ...is that you grow up! That's criminal. What is criminal is to blame us for something, we were not responsible for. When is it ever going to end? Dad. That was murder! This endless wallowing in guilt. How do you live with this? How can you live with it? GUSTAV: We did what had to be done. I sacrificed myself, you wimp. For you, too. Do you think that was easy? Tomorrow you get it done. Pretending you didn't know, wouldn't save your ass now, anyway. [breathing shakily] [♪♪♪] [crying] KONRAD: We re-checked all testimonies and found evidence that was not followed up, back then. We didn't have the technical means twenty years ago. That's why we brought in a ground radar, that's how we found the spot in the Doost yesterday. ANJA: And that was his grave for 20 years? He was slain, just like Anna, out of the blue, without any reason? KONRAD: That's what it looks like. Trust me we'll make Xavier talk. [breathing shakily] [♪♪♪] [coughs, spits] RECEPTIONIST: You have an appointment, I suppose? No. Are you related? Xavier Leybach murdered my father. We are related by blood, so to speak. Where is he? Listen, you will have to consult with the doctor in charge. You can't just go in there! ANJA: Look at me! Xavier! I have to talk to you. Xavier. Xavier, look at me! Look at me, please look at me! Why have you killed him? Say something. Look at me! [crying] [water falling] [splash] [keys clicking] [buzzer rings] [taking deep breathes] [water dripping] [taking deep breathes] [water falling] Go away! Now also my brother. When is it enough? What is it that you want from us? [crying] [♪♪♪] ANJA: August 16th, 1979. Urtica Dioica, Nettle. Location: Haingries. Unusual nettle field discovered in spruce forest. Such an anomaly suggests unusually high nitrogen deposition. Request 287 March 1982 Creation of a wild meadow... Client: Anna Leybach Franz Joseph Strauß and the Italian president Sandro Pertini visit the Flossenbürg concentration camp. Teacher from Munich missing. According to his landlady, he left his vacation apartment to go on a planned excursion One Tobacco please. Thank you. SHOPKEEPER: Welcome. [dog barking in distance] FRANZ: Can you hand me the bag? So sorry for your loss. Thanks. Thanks. We'll get over it. So, the extension, or the new credit line... A new credit line ? That's why we are here, to talk everything through. WALTRAUD: Yes. Why new? Father. Well, you still owe the bank roughly 60.000 Deutschmarks, we agree on that. For renovations and build-up, you will need another 30.000. For that, our headquarters needs more assurance. We now have the Leybach Farm. BANK EMPLOYEE: That we included already. Or did your mother leave a will? But Xavier... There is no will. ...but is Xavier even eligible? Another thirty thousand? Father, Mother. One thing at a time. I just want to make sure we are all on the same page. Mrs. Gollas, don't you feel well? RUPERT: Would you prefer to wait outside? I'll sort this out. Go ahead. It's all way too complicated for them. Because of what happened, the whole concept is in jeopardy. You must be aware of that. No one runs around with a gun in the forest. Maybe. But think about it: a fairy tale themed forest, where a guy killed his mother? We also got the additional forest. First we install the treetop path... That's not the point... I got everything worked out and it adds up. The treetop path will generate a profit from day one. We'll do the theme park later. The bank will give you the 30.000 Marks without a fuss. For them it's a profitable deal, even if you go bankrupt. I am telling you this in confidence: if anything goes wrong, they will take everything you have. You'll be left with nothing. [tractor cranks] [foot falling] I heard the noise. I don't get it. Do you? Nobody really understood Xavier. I thought you were finished here? ANJA: Do you remember when this lot was cleared? When I was ten or eleven. Why? The ground was dug up unusually deep. You can see that? Top soil is like the skin of a child. It remembers everything If someone went missing in a forest, no one forgets that either. No one goes on holiday here. Someone dug a tremendous hole here. They probably had to remove extremely deep-rooted rootstock. Or maybe there was an accident, a spill of machine oil. Don't you also want to know why he did that? I just want things to be normal again. [birds chirping in background] [indistinct TV chatter] REPORTER: ...and the accession of Czech Republic to EU. The tragedy of Faunried, which has already claimed one life, at the beginning of the week, has taken a sinister turn. The suspected perpetrator Xavier Leybach committed suicide in the forensic mental institution. According to the police, he was also a suspect in the murder of Johannes Grimm. [sighs] [foot falling] [door opens and closes] Your brother? Killed and buried Johannes Grimm? You believe that? He clubbed his own mother to death. He hated Anna. Just like you. Let's go! Everybody bullied and pushed Xavier around, his whole life. He could not run away. And he even took care of her up to her very end. Because none of us could stand being with her. That's how it was, wasn't it? And now Xavier is supposed to have murdered this man Grimm. I won't believe it in a hundred years. Who cares what you believe. It's finally over. I spent the entire day with Xavier back then. We even saw Grimm go into the Leybach forest. Xavier has not killed him. And especially did he not bury a body in the Doost. How was he even supposed to go there? You are lying, you are all lying. Even you, mother. Anna did it! There are mass graves everywhere around here, Rupert. From the death marches. In the Haingries is one too. The prisoners from the concentration camp in Flossenbürg were driven south. The ones who managed to escape and hide in the forest, were hunted down and beaten to death. Zebra Hunting, they called it. Xavier had to watch it all at that time. For his education they've said. And then this teacher came and started digging right there. Of all years, in the summer of '79! That year there was a memorial service at the concentration camp. If this teacher had found the mass grave then the whole world would have known about it. So everyone was fine with Anna killing the teacher. That's why everybody kept their mouth shut! Even Gustav. RUPERT: And where are the bodies now? [♪♪♪] FRANZ: One day is enough. You'll have it back in the morning. JOHANN: How many cubic meters? FRANZ: Four by six, fifty centimeters deep. JOHANN: That's more than seven cubic meters, so a tripple-axle unit would be scarce. With fluid system as well? [phone ringing] Yes? RUPERT: Anja? It's me, Rupert. The funeral is this weekend. I know. I'm sorry. RUPERT: I know your internship is over but can we meet again? I'm going home. RUPERT: Take care Anja. Is she gone? Yes. [takes deep breath] Are we doing the right thing, Konrad? What else should we do? Tell the truth. [scoffs] And ruin all of us? Xavier took revenge for it. And paid for it. Yes. We all pay eventually. Your father too. Anna murdered Johannes Grimm and he covered her. Do you call that paying? Two years ago, I got a call from the director of the concentration camp memorial in Flossenbürg. He wanted to meet me. So we drove further out to a farm, somewhere near Waldmünchen. An old woman lived there, with her daughter. The old woman had only a few months left to live. So she wanted to confess. What did she want to confess? In the spring of 1945, right past their farm, concentration camp inmates were driven south. One inmate collapsed. They've shot him. And she heard the shot. After they had gone, she went outside found the body, dragged it back to her property and buried it there. For fifty years this family has taken care of this anonymous grave. But the old woman felt so bad that she wanted to confess it, so she could die in peace. She wanted the bones to be buried in the concentration camp cemetery and for the relatives to be informed. What did you do? Nothing. Some things have to be endured in silence. Even if it's hard. That is also a way of reconciliation. [door opens and closes] [knocking] [kissing] [taking deep breathes] [screaming] [gasps] [taking deep breathes] [birds chirping in distance] [creaking] [♪♪♪] Lord, forgive Xavier. You gave him a tough life. He was just a poor man. Give him the peace he could not find here. Amen. Amen. Amen. Well then. [clears throat] [engine starts] [crying] [knocking] Miss Grimm, You can't believe how sorry I am about all that has happened to you here. If there is anything I can do... Where is that? In the Doost. In the Doost? Such a huge nettle field in nitrogen poor soil? Someone should have noticed this a long time ago. Yes. But who would ever think of that. That's true. Have a safe trip. Good bye. [♪♪♪] ANJA: Soil disturbance in the Haingries, at same location as nettle field, before creation of the wild meadow. [shoveling in background] [engine starts] [indistinct chatter] ANJA: A beer, please. The bill. I'll take it. Thanks. Good night then. Did I do something wrong? Nobody said that. Maybe he thought now she's coming back to find out what I have done. But why killing Anna, then? Otherwise, he didn't need a reason to kill my father. So it does make sense again, doesn't it? I've got to go, Anja. ANJA: You have to build you fairy tale forest. How about a gingerbread house? Hansel and Gretel in the Leybach Farm. Do you know the story? Sure. ANJA: I mean the real story. That was a pretty antisocial family. Who's abandoning their children in a forest, during a famine. But these kids weren't normal either. They were petty criminals. Did they knock on the door to ask for help? They broke into the house right away. The old woman understood immediately. And locked up the boy. I would have done the same. The girl was just as depraved. So she frees him, they beat the woman to death, rob her, burn the body and return home with rich loot. The parents have no problem believing the outrageous story about the wicked witch. And neither do we. Our favorite fairy tale is nothing but a disgusting, oversugared pogrom story. It's ingrained deeply Rupert. We don't even hear the screams of that burning woman. What do you want? Good luck with your fairy tale forest, Rupert. [clears throat] [indistinct chatter] [taking deep breathes] [indistinct chatter] ANJA: The transport route at the Haingries leads from the high seat at the wild meadow, deeper and deeper into the Leybach forest. Watchpost for operational team. I am in position. [inhales, exhales] WALKIE-TALKIE: Operational team to watchpost: On schedule. Confirm. Watchpost for operational team: Confirm. Over. [shovel clicking] [agitator starts] RUPERT: Less plasticizer! Stop. [birds chirping in distance] [♪♪♪] [taking deep breathes] [gunshot] [grunting, groans] RUPERT: Anja! [taking deep breathes] ANJA: No. [car whooshing] KONRAD: Stop! [breathing shakily] So that's how it is. KONRAD: Holy Mary! Gustav! It is for the likes of you we've done all that. Gustav! It's over. Over. Father, stop it, please! [♪♪♪] [gunshot] [♪♪♪] When the Nazis disbanded the concentration camps, shortly before the end of the war in 1945, thousands of prisoners perished on death marches across Bavaria. Their murderers were German soldiers who had orders to cover up traces. Civilians from the surrounding villages participated in the murders and tried to cover up their deeds for a long time after the war. Bones are still found in the Upper Palatinate to this day.
