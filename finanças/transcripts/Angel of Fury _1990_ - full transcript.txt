(Richard screaming) (Bolt spitting) (Bolt chuckling) I swear, I don't know anything! Ah! No! No, no, no! (cleaver thudding) (flesh squelching) (Richard screaming) - [Bolt] Martin, go get the girl now. - [Martin] Mmm-hmm. - Or maybe this is just the thing to help us get to the truth. Huh? What do you think? Come here. Open wide. - [Girl] Daddy? Daddy? - [Richard] No, don't hurt my kid. Please, please leave her alone. She's innocent, please! - Well, hello, sweetheart. - [Richard] No! (Richard sobbing) Please! - Oh. This poor thing thinks you're not dead. Why's that? (girl whimpering) - Daddy. - Aw, don't cry. Wipe your eyes off. - Daddy? - I'd hate to have to give you to Tay. (Tay chuckling) Oh, he just loves to play with little girls. He really enjoys it. - No! - Daddy. (whimpering) - You know, it could be easy, Richard. Just tell me about the courier, and you and your kid can be free. Free, Richard. Isn't that what you want? - I'll tell you everything. - [Bolt] Good. Who is it? - Please. - [Bolt] Who? - Bolan. The courier's name is Nancy Bolan. - Ah. Bolan. (girl whimpering) There. Richie, don't worry. Did you hear? Richie, everything's gonna be just fine. Hmm? (laughing) (girl whimpering) - Dad. (whimpering) - Tay. (mimicking knife slashing) (ship horn blaring) - [Man] There you go! In my dreams! (ship horn blaring) - [Man] Right this way, Ma! Right this way. - Nancy! Nancy! My mother said it's okay. - That's great. I'll be there. - It looks like you've made a new friend. - Promise? You promise you'll come? Promise? - I promise, Sarah. (Sarah giggling) - [Man] Over here! - [Man] Hey, sweetcakes. (elbow thudding) (man grunting) (Sarah laughing) - Bye-bye, see you later. - Bye, so long! - Miss Bolan? I'm with security at Gold Crane, Incorporated. Name's Tony. I must say it's an honor meeting you. I've heard a lot about you. May I? - No, I don't think so. I thought my arrival was a secret. - I was sent by Randolph. - [Man] Ee-yah! - [Tony] Look out! (men grunting) - [Man] Get the case! (kicks thudding) - [Man] Get the case! (tense dramatic music) (kick thudding) (man screaming) (kicks thudding) - [Nancy] Hah! (kick thudding) - [Man] Don't let her get away! (punches smacking) (kicks thudding) (men grunting) (punches smacking) (man thudding) (gun firing) (men grunting) (tense dramatic music) (gun firing) (man screaming) - [Man] Hey! (boards clattering) (kick thudding) (Nancy grunting) (kicks thudding) (man grunting) (board snapping) (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) (punches smacking) (kicks thudding) - Ha! (kick thudding) (boards snapping) (kicks thudding) (both grunting) (Nancy grunting) (kick thudding) (man thudding) (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) (barrel clattering) - [Man] Let's get her, man. (men grunting) - Nancy, over here! (men grunting) - [Man] Get to the boat! Where'd they go? - Over there! (gun firing) Get 'em out! - [Man] Hurry up! (gun firing) - [Man] They're getting away! - [Man] Come on, let's shove off! (gun firing) (seagulls squawking) - Ah, they're heading for the island. Got it? - Yeah. Yup. Okay. - Just getting good, eh, Miss Bolan? - Well, that was quite a welcome. Just one question, Tony. Do you mind if I call you Tony? - [Tony] Split. - [Man] Okay. - All right then, Tony. Do you mind telling me where in the hell you're taking me? (gun firing) - [Tony] Stay down! (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) Down! (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) Ha! (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) Ha! Ah! (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) (man grunting) On your left! (man screaming) (soft dramatic music) - [Nancy] What was that all about? - [Tony] It's anyone's guess. You all right? - [Nancy] I'm fine. - Andrew. (gun clicking) (dramatic music) - [Andrew] Sweet dreams, Miss Bolan. Sleep tight. - She's still out cold. (foot thudding) (pot shattering) (tense dramatic music) (kick thudding) (man grunting) (pot shattering) (kicks thudding) (man screaming) (water splashing) (punches smacking) (kicks thudding) (Nancy grunting) - Get out! (Nancy grunting) (fist smacking) (Nancy grunting) You look great. Really great. (soft romantic music) (hand smacking) What the hell was that for? - How about for making me think you've been dead for the past three years? - Okay, I can understand that. Now take it easy. Did you ever think that maybe there's a reason why I was letting you think I was dead for the last three years? - [Nancy] Oh, yeah? - Uh! All right, you know the last operation I did for the agency? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. - Three dead agents, a lot of innocent people. All because of Bolt. The terrorist just strikes like lightning. Well, he nailed me and he nailed me good, and I've been lookin' for him ever since. - Oh, you son of a bitch. Do you know what you put me through? Just so you can nail Bolt. Mark, you never even called. - I couldn't call you. If I called you, Bolt would've known where you were. And then he would've come and grabbed you. I don't want anybody to grab you. - Is that right? - That's right. (soft romantic music) So tell me about this computer you brought in. Why here? - The company wanted a sophisticated computer, so we thought that this would be a great place to test it. We're bringing in three different cases by three different couriers. If one courier gets caught, then we can beef up security on the other two, or cancel the whole operation. There's also an explosive device set in each case. If you try to open it from the outside, it sets it off and- - Boom. - Big boom. - So, naturally, you need the access code to get inside or the whole thing melts down. - Wait a minute. Why am I telling you all this? I haven't seen you in three- - Hey, I don't want your silly, little computer. I want Bolt. And Bolt wants Nancy. - And Nancy wants you. (soft romantic music) (kisses smacking) (Tony groaning) (phone ringing) (Tony groaning) - Yeah? That doesn't give us much time. All right, I'll be down. - Now let's get straight to the point. You don't know who they were, what they look like, or where they took you. And they have a case which you were carrying which may or may not be the real computer. That it, Miss Bolan? - That's just about all I can tell you. - Mmm-hmm. - Miss Bolan, in case you weren't listening, you've told us absolutely nothing. We've got zip to go on. - Don't forget they drugged her, Leo. - Now then. Chin, I want you to take some men to meet Hudson down at the airport. And Chin, I don't want anything to go wrong this time. No more screw ups. He gets in 11:20am, flight 40A. And Chin, if anything else goes wrong, I'll hold you responsible. - Don't worry, Mr. Randolph. I'll be there. Good day, gentlemen. Miss Bolan, it was a pleasure. - Chin, I want you to be careful, and watch your backside. I'm confident in your ability to handle the assignment. - Yeah, okay. - Good. - [Man] Get the file yesterday. - Uh, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I'll see you tomorrow at the airport. - Not so fast. You've already lost one bag. I don't want some pansy ass girl gettin' in the way, screwing things up. - Listen, sweetcakes. I'm still the head of security at HTI, appointed by Donald Thore, the owner. I don't know who you think you're talking to, slick, but this is my operation. All I have to do is pick up the phone and you'll be out drilling holes on some oil rig. So why don't you go home, have a nice dinner, take a cold shower, and chill out? Got it? I'm glad we had this time to chat. It was special. (David chuckling) Gentlemen, it was a pleasure. Good day. - [David] Goodbye, Miss Bolan. (David chuckling) - I've got two calls. He's gonna fax me an MO tomorrow. - [Man] Look, tomorrow would be a little better for me. - [Announcer] The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking. (tense dramatic music) The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. - [Announcer] Your attention, please. Flight 148 now arriving from Amsterdam at gate B4. Flight 148 now arriving from Amsterdam at gate B4. - [Courier] Hmm. - Move. - [Announcer] Arriving passenger E. Carson, please pick up a white courtesy booth. Arriving passenger E. Carson, please pick up a white courtesy booth. (tense dramatic music) - Get ready. They're out. - Stay with 'em. (tense dramatic music) - [Announcer] Your attention, please. This is your final boarding call for flight 429, now departing for Los Angeles, gate E3. Flight 429 now departing for Los Angeles, gate E3. - [Man] Take it easy. - [Announcer] All passengers should be on board. (tense dramatic music) (man grunting) (kicks thudding) (men grunting) (elbow thudding) (kick thudding) (man screaming) (crowd screaming) (dramatic music) (canister clattering) (crowd screaming) (dramatic music) - [Man] Let's go. - [Courier] All right. - [Man] Come on, come on. (tense dramatic music) (gun firing) (crowd screaming) (guns firing) (tense dramatic music) (courier screaming) - [Chin] I'll take that. (tense dramatic music) (crowd screaming) - [Tony] Chin! Hold it! (gun firing) (man screaming) (gun firing) (man screaming) (kicks thudding) (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) - Here. Cover me. (gun firing) (tense dramatic music) (man screaming) (kicks thudding) (man screaming) (kicks thudding) (man grunting) - Ha! (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) - [Man] You all right? - [Man] Let's go! Get out of here! Hurry! This way! - [Man] Over here! Over here! - South end. - Right. (Tony grunting) - [Nancy] Tony, are you all right? - I'm fine. - Good. Hang tight. - Yeah. (gun firing) (tense suspenseful music) (kick thudding) (gun firing) - [Man] Hold it! (gun firing) (man screaming) (Chin panting) (soft dramatic music) - [Man] No, I didn't see anything. - [Man] See you, Johnny. - [Man] Yeah, right here. - [Nancy] You see Chin? - [Mark] I thought you had him. (tires screeching) Look out! (tires screeching) (gun firing) Son of a bitch! (Chin chuckling) - Two down, one to go. (face mask ripping) You did pretty good for a dead man, old boy. (chuckling) (horn honking) - To be honest with you, Miss Bolan, I'm beginning to lose my confidence in your abilities. - Mr. Randolph, I'm still here. That means my operation isn't over yet. - Ha, I knew it! The first two were sent just to smoke out the opposition. (David sighing) It's a pity about Chin. But now we know the truth. - He'll be missed, but he can be replaced. - So much for team spirit. - Well. Let's get on with it. When can we expect the real computer? - Late tomorrow morning. I'll give you the details tomorrow at 8:00am. - We need the details now. - That's enough, Leo. She's in charge of the operation. She gives the orders. - Leo? Leo? Cheer up. (laughing) - [David] What's the matter, Leo? Don't you like taking orders from a beautiful woman? (David chuckling) - I don't know what the hell happened last time. Someone should be there when she walks out of the building. You have my word on it. Huh? Yeah. It'll be done my way. Don't worry. When the time is right, we'll kill the bitch. Give me a beer. (tab popping) Tang and seven guys are waiting to follow her. I want you to take care of this personally. She's the only one with the code to open the case. I want her healthy and alive. We need her to open the case without blowing us up, so don't fuck up. You got it? - Mmm-hmm. (engines rumbling) (man grunting) (engines rumbling) - Oh, Nancy, you really kept your promise! - Hi, there. And now it's time for you to keep your promise. It's no problem. Your mom already gave permission for you to go. - Thank you, Mommy! - Mmm-hmm. All right, but be back by nine o'clock. - Okay, Mom. I promise. - Ready? - [Sarah] Mmm-hmm. - [Linda] Have fun. - Thanks, Linda. - Bye. - [Sarah] Bye bye! (tense dramatic music) (people talking indistinctly) - [Man] Don't lose 'em. (tense dramatic music) - [Nancy] It's Mickey Mouse. - [Sarah] He's my favorite, honk-honk. (laughing) - [Nancy] Eh-eh! - [Sarah] Okay. (laughing) - Oops! (kicks thudding) Let's go get some ice cream. Come on. (riders screaming) (tense dramatic music) - [Woman] How does that feel? (Bolt groaning) - Bolt's gonna be pissed. Oh, man. (men grunting) - [Woman] Come on. Get him! Come on! Come on! - Hey, I didn't lose him and you did, so you tell him. (men grunting) - Come on. (men grunting) - [Man] I'm not sayin' nothin'. It wasn't my fault. You're in charge. - [Man] Aw, man. It's gonna be ugly. (men grunting) - Get him! Get him! (men grunting) - [Man] Bolt, we lost 'em. - [Bolt] What? How could you lose 'em? - [Man] It wasn't our fault. - I can't believe, man, you lost 'em! You idiot! (punch smacking) (woman screaming) - [Man] Did you send it by courier? - [Woman] No. - Morning. - [Woman] Good morning. - [Nancy] Morning. - Morning. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Morning, Miss Bolan. - Let's get right down to business. The final courier and case are presently on route to Northwest train station. It will arrive in exactly one half hour, which gives us 20 minutes to get there with little time for the opposition. - That's clever, Miss Bolan. - Why, thank you, Leo. - Miss Bolan? I just told him underestimated the opposition. - Trust me. - Hmm. (tense dramatic music) - [Nancy] Mr. Randolph, this tape is for your ears only. I altered the plans. The third courier will not be coming by train, as I told you. He'll be arriving at the airport at the south strip by helicopter. I originally told you the train because I suspect there's a leak in the organization. Somebody's been tipping off the opposition because they know every move we make before we make it. I'd appreciate it if you told no one of this change of plans. One other thing, Mr. Randolph. You'll need to arrange the transportation for the courier. I have a feeling I'm being tailed. I'll keep you informed of any further developments. (phone dialing) - Collins, Randolph here. Yeah, okay. Look, I need a favor. Nothing dangerous. I just want you to pick up a friend. Northwest airport. He'll be coming in by chopper. Yeah, they'll be a woman there in a red Mercedes. Her name's Bolan. No. Yes, that's it. She's expecting you. All right. Okay, Collins. Thanks. (tense dramatic music) (tires screeching) (tense dramatic music) (tires screeching) - That's him. Go on! Move it! (tense dramatic music) (tires screeching) (tense dramatic music) (tires screeching) (tense dramatic music) - Hey, what's going on? (gun firing) - Hurry up! Get 'em out of there! Now! Move! (tense dramatic music) Move your ass. (tense dramatic music) Let's go! (helicopter whirring) - [Man] This is blue team leader. LLZ is an abandoned strip. South main control. - [Man] Roger, BT1. It's post. - [Man] Roger, BT1. (tense dramatic music) (helicopter whirring) - [Man] We're heading 273, tight formation to the marker. Blue team, mark 273, bravo, tango, foxtrot. Shall we dance? - [Man] BT1, blue team, aye. Bravo, tango, foxtrot, x-ray mark. Position x-ray. - [Man] Fly to the main fall. X-ray, on. Charlie, aye, BT1. (tense dramatic music) - [Man] All vehicles should be our contacts. They will identify on visual close. (tense dramatic music) Mark the glide. 12 o'clock down. - [Man] 6410, contact in sight. (helicopters whirring) - [Man] Bravo, tango, one. Contacts in sight. We'll wait for the ID. - [Man] Standby. - Code names. - Bolan. - [Man] All right, Captain, we have our contact. Let's set them down. - [Man] Bravo, tango, one. Wing, you have it. - [Man] Channel two is called. Two is the call. - [Man] Channel two, mark. BT1. (helicopters whirring) - [Man] Put it down smartly and soft. Split the group decoy. Deploy the officers now at the marker. Mark. (tense dramatic music) (helicopters whirring) - [Man] BT1, wing post and port control will continue mission as planned. - [Man] Bravo tango team, understood. Charlie Mike. - [Man] Charlie Mike, BT leader. (tense dramatic music) - Mr. Williams? Let's go. - [Man] Goin' in. (tense dramatic music) (helicopter whirring) - Yury, it's nice to see you again. - Likewise. Let's do this, shall we? - Here's your ride. We'll go back over everything later at Gold Crane. Bye. - [Yury] All right, I'll see you there. (tense dramatic music) Hey, what the? (gun firing) (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) (man screaming) (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) (tires screeching) (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) (man grunting) (glass shattering) (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) (guns firing) (explosions booming) (tense dramatic music) - Uh! Shit! (Nancy sighing) (tense dramatic music) (flames crackling) - [David] Hmm. - You must be Miss Bolan. - [Nancy] Mmm-hmm. - I'm Captain Jack LeRoy, head of internal security. Miss Bolan, security is more effective when all the operatives are informed of the details. - Captain LeRoy, may I call you Jack? - Sure. - Jack. I'm sure that there is a leak in Gold Crane, so by changing the meeting place and time, I could throw off the opposition. - [David] Hmm. - Well, look, let me tell you something. Your thinking has left us with some dead unknowns, and a dead courier. (David exhaling) - You've lost three cases. The two dummies and the real one. - A minor setback. - A minor setback? Is that what you call it? I call it disgusting. I've been with the organization 25 years, and I've never seen this kind of bungling. I've never seen anything like it. We've lost time and lives for what? I'm gonna have to phone Mr. Thore, and I'm sure he'll agree with me. If it were up to me, you'd be on that oil rig, drilling some holes. When I'm through with my report, you'll be lucky if you can get a job as a security guard at a swap meet. - You're awfully quiet. - Why should I say anything? You've learned your lesson. Stay to women's work and let men take care of men's work. - That's it. I'm outta here. Good day, gentlemen. - Don't leave the city, Miss Bolan. - I'm not going anywhere, Captain. I have other plans. - Miss Bolan? Some friendly advice. Before you execute plans, call me first. We might save some lives. - Thanks for the advice, friend. (jazzy piano music) (patrons murmuring) (drink sloshing) Oh, Mark! I'm sorry. Here, let me dry you. - [Mark] Right. - Mmm, I've had such a bad day. - [Mark] Yeah. - I don't know, maybe Leo's right. Maybe I should just go home and leave the work to the men. - Leo, huh? - Yeah, Mr. Personality himself. - I'll fix Leo. - And how are you gonna do that? - That's who I'm working for. - Get out of here. - Leo's the head of my operation. - Are you serious? You're working for Leo, that snake? After everything I told you about him? - I know, he speaks very highly of you, too. Goodnight, Chino. - [Nancy] The man's had a personality bypass. (water running) - One thing we have in common, Sarah loves to shop. - [Nancy] Let's go to the toy shop first. - This is fun. - Right. Okay. - Ooh. These are pretty. - [Sarah] Uh-uh. - Okay, no, you don't like those? Let's see. How about this bag here? No? - [Sarah] Mmm-mmm. - [Nancy] Okay. Telephone. - [Linda] You want that? - It's for you. (laughing) - [Linda] Come on. - Look at these here. - That's nice. - [Nancy] Ah. Uh-huh. - Try them. - Try on this one here. Movie star. (Sarah laughing) No. Okay. Look, I had one of those when I was a girl. - [Sarah] You did? - At least we got a tour of the store. Okay, Sarah. This is your last chance if you want anything. - [Sarah] Hmm. - [Nancy] Oh, this is interesting. - [Sarah] Yeah, it's neat! - Let's take a look and see what's over here. - All right. - What's your favorite color? - I like that. - Sarah, do you like this one here? - [Sarah] Yeah! - How about this one? - [Sarah] No. - I don't think we're having any luck today. What do you say? Let's go. - Okay. - Come on, Sarah. I'll buy you a hamburger. - [Sarah] Good, I'm starved. - Maybe you'd like me to buy you a new car. Is that what it is? - [Sarah] Yeah. (Linda gasping) - [Linda] Nancy, look out! - [Sarah] Nancy! (Linda screaming) (Nancy thudding) (Nancy grunting) (punch smacking) (kicks thudding) (punches smacking) (man screaming) - [Linda] Oh, my arm! Let go! Let me go! Nancy, help me! (punches smacking) (Linda screaming) Let go of me! Help! Please, stop! - [Sarah] Nancy! (kicks thudding) (punches smacking) - You all right? I'll get Sarah. - [Sarah] Stop! Please! - [Man] Shut up, you little brat! (kick thudding) (cans clattering) (kick thudding) (cans clattering) (tense dramatic music) (glass shattering) (Nancy grunting) (kick thudding) (tense dramatic music) - [Sarah] Help me! Somebody help me! Put me down! Let go of me! Let go of me! No! No! - [Man] Let's go! Now! - [Sarah] Please let me go! (tense dramatic music) (engine starting) (tires screeching) - Bastards. (Sarah screaming) - Kill her! (tires screeching) (Sarah screaming) (horns honking) (tires screeching) (tense dramatic music) - [Man] Hey, come here. (man screaming) (Sarah screaming) (tires screeching) (horn honking) (cars crashing) (tires screeching) (Sarah screaming) - [Man] Keep her quiet! (horn honking) (tires screeching) (cars thudding) (tense dramatic music) - Nancy! - [Man] Get back in here! (gun firing) (tires screeching) (biker screaming) - Nancy! (motorcycle revving) (Sarah sobbing) (motorcycle revving) (tires screeching) (Sarah sobbing) (tires screeching) (motorcycle revving) - Help! (motorcycle revving) - [Nancy] Get out! (glass shattering) (man screaming) (car crashing) (man grunting) (Sarah sobbing) - [Nancy] Sarah! (man screaming) - Nancy! (tense dramatic music) Nancy! (gun firing) - No! (tense dramatic music) Sarah! (tense dramatic music) (kicks thudding) (man grunting) (punch smacking) (kick thudding) (knee thudding) (kicks thudding) (man grunting) (tense dramatic music) (Sarah grunting) (bones cracking) Sarah. (Sarah sobbing) - Mommy. Nancy. (Sarah sobbing) (tense dramatic music) - Sarah? (tense dramatic music) (Nancy sobbing) Sarah! - Sarah! Sarah! Oh! - Sorry. I'm sorry, Linda. (sobbing) - Sarah. (crying) Sarah. (crying) (soft piano music) (patrons murmuring) - How you feelin'? - Sick. I, I just can't believe that Sarah is dead. (crowd murmuring) - Look, Nancy. You can't blame yourself for what happened. Those were Bolt's men. They kill people for a living. All right, you did what you were trained to do, and if you didn't do what you were trained to do, it'd be different. You better stop beating yourself up over this. It's not your fault. I'm telling you, this guy Bolt is bad news. He'll stop at nothing and he doesn't care who he hurts. I hate that son of a bitch, and I'm thankful that he didn't finish you. - What I really wanna know is how Bolt is getting his information. (Mark sighing) Richard, your assistant at HTI. - Richard? - Yeah. He's dead, Nancy. They found his body yesterday. And from the looks of it, the kid held out a long time before he talked, so he must've told Bolt about the cases. They killed his little girl, too. - This is really gettin' out of hand. We gotta nail that son of a bitch. (Mark sighing) - Check. So, which case has the computer? - Gee, Mark, I don't know what case has the computer. - Well, that's fine. So don't trust me. But as it happens, I think I have a plan. - I always knew you'd be good for something. - Yeah. Ah, I forgot my wallet. You have anything? - See if they'll take this. - Uh! (soft piano music) So, you in? - Yeah, I'm in. - You sure? - Mmm-hmm. I'm sure. - Good. (jazzy romantic music) Hey. What are you thinking about? (jazzy romantic music) - [Nancy] I've really missed you. (jazzy romantic music) (Nancy moaning) (jazzy romantic music) (kisses smacking) (dark ominous music) (tense suspenseful music) (Nancy gasping) - [Man] Yah! (punches smacking) (kicks thudding) (men grunting) (blow dart hissing) (Nancy grunting) (tense dramatic music) (water splashing) - Well, Miss Bolan. Looks like you're all washed up. (knife flicking) Such a pretty face. You know, it'd be a shame if anything were to happen to it. - Come on, Rambo. You know looks aren't everything. - Tay, get in here! Miss Bolan, permit me to introduce you to Tay. Tay's an unusual man. He's afraid of nothing. All that fate and karma stuff. He'll open the cases. And don't worry about us. We'll just duck behind these crates before he opens the case near you. - Hah, that's really a great place to be. You'll be really safe there, Bolt. Good thinking. Tay, can I call you Tay? - Yeah. - Tay, genius here doesn't understand there's a bomb in the case. A big bomb. Am I getting through to you, Tay? If you open up that case, it means they'll be picking up pieces of you in Cleveland. That means no more you, no more me, no more fashion statement. - [Tay] Hmm. - Tay. (tense suspenseful music) (electronic beeping) - Stop! The combination's 711. (bomb beeping) - Access code. - Gold Crane. Bolan. - [Bolt] Better be tellin' the truth. (bomb beeping) - What are you lookin' at me for? Try the other one. (bomb beeping) (tense suspenseful music) (bomb beeping) - [Bolt] Dammit! - Uh-oh. What can I say? (bomb beeping) (tense suspenseful music) - Jackson, kill her. (tense suspenseful music) (flame whooshing) - Bolt, I know who has the third computer. - [Bolt] I'm all ears, Miss Bolan. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Bolt] Don't say anything. Just listen. Bring the computer to the old Denver warehouse tomorrow morning at 8:00. Screw up and Nancy's dead, got it? - Yeah. Eight o'clock. - [Bolt] Be there. - I'll be there. They got her. Eight o'clock tomorrow. - That doesn't give us much time. - I've been waiting three long years. Bolt, the terrorist who strikes like lightning. (tense dramatic music) - [Man] Go! Go! Go! - [Man] Yeah, yeah. Goin' in. (tense dramatic music) - You brought the computer? (tense dramatic music) Send the case over. (tense dramatic music) - Bring me the girl, I'll bring you the case. You and me, we'll meet in the middle. - [Bolt] Deliver the bitch. (tense dramatic music) Hold it right there. Now you put the case down and we'll release the girl. - No tricks, Bolt. Cut her loose. (tense dramatic music) (Bolt chuckling) (tense dramatic music) (wall exploding) - [Man] Oh! (kick thudding) - [Man] Over here! Comin' through there! (gun firing) - [Man] Get the girl!
