[car horn honking] [retching] There you are. -What? -[retching] [coughs] Come on. See what happens when you drink too much. Come on! Let's go. Feeling better? The manager approved it, by the way. You can reclaim your wristwatch tonight. Just bring money. I thought they accept credit cards. Before, all we had to do was sign. But the manager declined. Next time you're short on cash, let me know. I'll help you. Just don't get into trouble. Taxi! Are you okay? -You sure? -Yeah, yeah. Let's go. [groans] [female DJ] Hi there. It's a sunny morning here in Metro Manila. And if you're out there, especially on your way to Manila, you'll expect bumper to bumper traffic. And to ease the traffic stress, I'll be riding with you to give you some music excitement, courtesy of your jazz station. And it's going to be another musical experience with me, giving you the hits that will surely bring you far beyond your earthly imagination. And when I say experience, you can feel it in your bones, sounds that are hitting Metro Manila this week and you can only have it with me. [car horn honking] On the verge of doing something you don't feel like to, listen to this. Maybe then you'll make up your mind. Here's Ernesto Gonzales and his kind of music. [jazz music playing] [water splashing] What now? I've been swimming for hours. Just admit you don't have the stamina anymore. -Are you done? -It's no fun without you. You know what? I dropped something in the water. If you find it, it's yours. -What is it? -You have to dive in. Go get it. [water splashes] -What is this? -A key. -Key to what? -Key to your house. -Huh? -Drop the act. Here's the address. [chuckles] Good morning, sir. Dear? Joel's on the phone. -But it's too early. -Just go talk to him. By the way, Mom, I like this one. Use it for my bouquet tomorrow, okay? Mm-hm. [birds chirping] Hi. Hello? Grace? Guess what my Dad got us as a present. -What? -House and lot. I'm holding the key right now. Really? Let's take a look at it. Where is it located? [Joel] 6 Mount Everest Street, Carmel Village. The size of the kitchen is just right. -Yes. -Right? And we can put a breakfast nook over here. Breakfast nook? You don't even know how to cook. [chuckles] You jerk. I can cook. Oh, yeah? What dishes can you cook? -A lot, actually. Pork stew... -Fried eggs, boiled water? Stop it. [chuckles] Boiled beef, sweet and sour fish, chicken ginger stew. What else did Mom teach me? Joel? Joel? Joel? Where did he go? Joel? Joel? Joel! -[yells] -[gasps] -[both chuckle] -You're so silly, you know that? You'll get lost in this house. It's like a maze in here. Yeah. -We can play hide-and-seek! -And you want to play? -[chuckles] -Come here. [Grace] This must be the dining room. -[Joel] Yes. -[Grace] Joel, look. There's more space here. -How many kids do you want? -Seven. Why seven? -It's my lucky number. -What's this, a gambling game? -Where are you going? -I'll check out the bedrooms. -Oh! Ouch! -What happened to you? -[groans] -You should be more careful. [laughs] What's the matter with you? It isn't funny! -Ouch! -You're annoying. [chuckles] [Grace] I think this is the boys' room. Oh, the girls' room. [soft music playing] Joel? People say that white gowns are for virgin brides only. So? Nothing. I already told you that I don't care whether you're a virgin or not. What matters is that I love you. I just want to be honest. I don't like keeping secrets, especially from you. What's the matter? You seem anxious about something. No. I guess it's normal for us women to feel this way before getting married. Insecurities get the best of us. You can't really blame me, you know. All my life I've lived with Dad and Mom. Now, I'm suddenly moving in to a new house with you. You're saying you don't know me well enough? There are a lot of things I don't know about you. -Like? -Just stuff. Okay, I'll give you an idea. -I sleep on my back. -[both chuckle] I don't use a pillow for my head. I do use one for my feet. I rub my feet against it. -[chuckles] -I don't snore. I stay still when I sleep. I don't have smelly feet. [laughs] I love watching basketball games on TV. And I shower before going to bed. I like reading best-selling novels. I love to eat vegetables, roast beef, too, and chicken adobo with liver. [both chuckle] I don't drink coffee in the morning. I drink orange juice. -I don't eat a lot. -[chuckles] But unlike you, I'm not on a diet. Silly! I don't easily put on weight. What else do you want to know about me? -What else? -Nothing. -Do you love me? -Yes. [Joel] I often visit this place. Especially when I'm feeling sad or confused. I sit here and reflect on things. Sometimes, I talk to my Mom. I'm like a crazy person, right? But whenever I'm here, I feel at peace. It's hard to talk to my Dad at times. He always thinks he's right. He wants to call the shots all the time. I've never brought you here, right? Yes. You know, my Mom was a kind woman. Not once did I hear her pick a fight with Dad. That's considering Dad fooled around with other women. And that is why Mom didn't like you at first. She thought you might be like your dad. But even if Dad was a womanizer, he loved Mom very much. He said they were each other's first love. -First love? -Yes. That's why Dad never remarried. What was your answer for number five? I just copied all my answers. I don't know anything. We all secretly brought notes with us. -I have to go. -Okay. Bye. So? What's the... [women chuckling] What are you doing here? I'm here to pick you up. Let's go. I'll just talk to the driver. Mom might get suspicious. I love you. They say angels pass by when we're silent. [both laughing] Of course I lost my temper! I asked Aurora to talk to the flower vendors in Quiapo last week. So this morning I sent her back there to pay for our orders. Guess what? The flowers were bought by some matron for a wedding in San Agustin. What are you going to do? I told her to scour the whole stretch of Taft Avenue for flower shops. All I'm saying is that I won't use artificial flowers. If Aurora fails in her mission, I will cut off all the flowers at Luneta Park and use those to decorate the church. What kind of flower are you looking for? White roses. The whitest I can find. Why not use ordinary flowers? What? You want me to use ordinary flowers for your wedding? That's unacceptable. Don't you know that the most important occasion in every woman's life is her wedding? Oh, and to think that it's your wedding. Your Mom is right, Grace. I don't want ordinary flowers for your wedding. It's the wedding of my favorite daughter after all. [Elisa clears throat] What's wrong, Elisa? Momoy, every time I think about our daughter's wedding, my chest tightens. Here's a glass of water. [clears throat] Let's just eat. But keep this in mind, Grace and Joel, marriage is sacred. It's a holy sacrament. And as the elders say, it's not like food that you can spit out when it's too hot. Once you're married, you're committed to one person for the rest of your life. Look at us, Joel. We've been married for 26 years. And we're still happy with our life together. -Don't you ever fight? -[chuckles] You have no idea! Fights can't be avoided. Sometimes, it spices up the marriage. If you know you're at fault, admit it and apologize. Problem solved. If you think about it, marriages are supposed to be simple. I don't know why others want to complicate things, so they end up separating. In some cases, the husband gets a mistress or the wife finds a lover. Maybe they're not compatible. -Compatible or not, it's an-- -It's an issue of give and take. They only think about themselves. -Elisa, I was talking. -Then keep talking. We share the same thoughts anyway. [Momoy chuckles] I bet you're good in bed. Yes, sir. You and my daughter, you haven't--? -Not yet, sir. -For real? Yes, sir. She's a virgin. Have you done it with a virgin? Huh? Yes, sir. Be gentle with her, okay? Yes, sir. Don't give her a hard time. [chuckles] -Take this, Grace. -What's this for, Mom? It's for you. That ring has been passed down from mothers to daughters. It's been with our family for many generations. Grandma gave it to Mom, and my Mom gave it to me before I married your Dad. It is bequeathed to the favorite daughter. Keep it. It's for your wedding night. For the wedding night? Why? Well... Was it effective? Your Dad was gentle. Mom, Joel is a good man. [sobs] You're a virgin. [stammers] You know nothing. You're a virgin, my dear. [sobbing] Hi. Hi. [jazz music playing] [Grace groaning] -Hey, what's wrong? -[sobs] Let's go home. I thought you love me? If you really do, why don't you trust me? I'm going to marry you. I'll never betray you. [romantic music playing] [baby crying] Where's Ellen? She went to the grocery store. We're out of baby formula. -Aw... -[baby continues crying] There, there. Hush now. [woman laughing] [panting] -Did you get one? -Here. Let's play. No, thanks. I'll just watch you play. Lani! Lani! Lani! -[car engine starting] -Lani! -Dad. -Yeah? -How come you never remarried? -[chuckles] Why do you ask? I just want to know why. Mommy's been dead for many years. It's uncommon for men to stay single for a long time -after losing a wife. -[chuckles] A man has several reasons why he gets married. Some marry for convenience, others do it for security reasons. But many get into marriage by accident. Like a thief in the night, it comes without you even noticing it. You know, you can tell that someone is lucky if he marries because of love. That's why I married your mother. Because we loved each other. The reason why I never remarried is because I haven't met anyone quite like your mother. Aren't you willing to settle for someone less? No, I don't want to, Joel. If she's nothing like your mother, no thanks. But Mommy's one of a kind. You won't find anyone like her. That's why I don't want to get married again. But why? I'm happy this way. Dad, you didn't answer my question. Joel... Do you love Grace? Yes. But if I had the power to choose, -I'll marry someone else. -Oh? Who then? Somebody you don't know. [chuckles] So you have a secret. Then why don't you marry her? She's gone. She vanished into thin air. So she's gone. What can you do about it? Oh, come on, be realistic. Dad, but I am being realistic. But is love enough guarantee for a successful marriage? It's the best guarantee. Drop by my pad after this so I could help you with whatever's bothering you. I have something for you. Hi. I'm Julie. I'm Lani. Where's the bathroom? This way. [door closes] [Julie] Aren't you going to join me? [water running] [groans] [jazz music playing] ♪ Hearing samba song Makes me feel good ♪ Hi. Maybe you want to try this red snapper? It's big anyway. I can't really eat all of it. I would've asked you sooner but I saw your dinner. Hotdog and pork and beans. I figured you're afraid of swallowing fish bones. [soft chuckle] Is it cooked? Not yet. I'm not sure how you like your meat, medium rare or well-done. How do you like yours? It's more delicious if it's cooked medium rare since it's fresh. Here. Wait. What kind of fish is it? Red snapper. What's your name? I'm Lani. Aren't you going to ask what my name is? -What's your name? -Joel. -Hi. -Hi. [Joel] It's my first time here. Do you often come here? [Lani] Yes. [Joel] Do you live nearby? [Lani] No. I'm from Cebu, but I go to school in Manila. On weekends, I come here. [Joel] Alone? [Lani] Sometimes. But not when I dive. ♪ Enchanted by your eyes ♪ ♪ The palm trees awakened ♪ ♪ Shook their fronds And chanted ♪ ♪ Their hossanas of love ♪ ♪ In the prayer of your smile ♪ ♪ And the dark clouds Disappeared ♪ ♪ Light slowly filtered ♪ ♪ Into my quiet world ♪ ♪ Now I want to catch ♪ ♪ Every shimmering wave ♪ ♪ And gather from the shore ♪ ♪ Every diamond in the sand ♪ [Joel] I'm wondering.

[Joel] I'm sorry I ask too many questions. [Lani chuckles] Don't be. What is it? You're beautiful. -How did you find me? -I have my means. Aren't you going to invite me in? Come in. What is it? I love you. [both chuckle] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello? Looks like you're having too much fun. You couldn't answer the phone sooner. [chuckles] Why did you call? You might forget, you're having dinner with Grace and her parents tonight. What time is it? It's almost 6:30. Go home as soon as you're done. Okay. Are we leaving now? Yes. Close the door, please. [water splatters] Why isn't this on a hanger? It'll get wrinkled. Mm-hm. Is that what Christian made? It doesn't look like it costs 10,000. What do you mean it doesn't? Look at this. It's pure lace from Paris. [Elisa] Mind you, they don't have this here in the Philippines! Mommy, I think our daughter will be the most beautiful bride in the world tomorrow. Of course, Momoy! Don't forget that several advertising agencies have approached our daughter to endorse products like soap, liquor, and toothpaste. Even if Carling doesn't do her hair and makeup, she will still be the most beautiful bride. Joel is one lucky guy! [Momoy] Elisa, you're upsetting yourself again. [sobbing] There you go again. It really hurts, you know. After so many years? Would you rather that Grace doesn't get married at all? I didn't say that! Of course she needs to be married. She's a woman after all. Grace, this is your last night. Wait a second. You'll wrinkle this. Baby. My baby. [kisses] Baby. -Come here! -No! Ernesto, please! Damn it, Ernesto! I told you to go there, goddamn it! I can't do it! I can't! -Ernesto, please! -Get dressed! No! -Ernesto, no! -Get dressed! -I can't face her! -You don't want to, huh? Please! No. Ernesto, please! Enough! I'll do what you want. I'll get dressed. You will confess everything to her. If she doesn't agree to meet with me, I'll kill myself. Why are you wearing that? The black and white outfit I prepared looks better. Daddy, I'm getting married tomorrow. I know. That's why I want you to look your best. This will do. By the way, I'm taking the other car. -Why? -I'm going out with my friends after our dinner at Grace's place. Aren't you tired of all that? [chuckles] I'm just hanging out with my friends. Perla, don't forget my instructions. Don't bring out the fruit salad until I tell you to. -I'll just join the men. -[Manolo and Momoy chattering] [Manolo] That might happen to Elisa. [both laughing] For sure. Hey, are you two talking about me again? Because you're such a crybaby. Don't deny it. Today alone, you cried over five times. You know, Manolo, the wedding might not push through if she starts crying in church tomorrow! Of course not! Why would I break down? I know you. You'll probably faint. Oh, I'll need to bring ammonia then. You can't blame me... You know, Manolo, we love Grace very much. Between our daughters, she's our favorite. She's our lucky charm. After Elisa gave birth to her, good things kept coming our way. Our mining business flourished. And your eldest daughter? I've never seen her. -Did you call her? -Yes. She said she's coming. Why isn't she here? Maybe her good-for-nothing husband intervened, so don't expect her to show up. You know, our eldest is the bane of our existence. It's true. I don't know whom Ellen takes after. She had no interest in studying. Every night, she's at the disco. It's hard to discipline her. And if you reprimand her, she'll lash out at you until you cry. My goodness. Then one day we found out that she got knocked up by a musician. We had no choice but to marry her off. Now they're living in an apartment in Pasay. We're providing for them. Manolo, Ellen is nothing like our dear Grace. By the way, where are our kids? Grace, do you really love me? [chuckles] What's the matter with you, Joel? Don't tell me you're the one who's feeling insecure now. Because... I can't get her out of my head. "Her?" I feel the same way, Joel. The only difference between us is that I got my closure. I wish you could tell me. Maybe next time. -It's pretty messed up. -But when? I don't know. Isn't it funny, Joel? We're getting married tomorrow and yet we don't know where we're really headed. But I love you. We can start from there. I love you too. Grace? Joel? Please come inside. Dinner is ready. -This one is good. Take that. -Serve it to them. [laughs] Joel, you're drunk already. -Here, Elisa. -That's a good idea, Momoy. Let's drink up. Oops, that's enough. I've had too much to drink. And for the lovebirds, here's something to set the mood. -Dad, you're so naughty. -Naughty? -[Grace] Naughty! -Your husband -will show you naughty. -[laughing] I think Joel won't need any of this. He's already flushed. Manolo, we can drink all night. We have no worries. -[doorbell dings] -Momoy, please sit, will you? Yeah. I'm coming, dear. Your roast beef is getting cold. I'm coming. Momoy, sit here. You look like you're enjoying yourselves. Manolo, Grace looks happy with Joel. [Manolo] I hope she doesn't end up being a crybaby like her mother. [Momoy] A crybaby, yes, but very affectionate. [all laughing] Ma'am, they're having dinner already. [indistinct chattering] I'd like to propose a toast. -[Elisa] Mm-hmm. -[Momoy] Okay. [Manolo] To Joel and Grace. May they have a happy life together and may their problems be few, and may they have lots and lots of children. [all] Cheers! Ellen. -Come. -Momoy, Ellen is here. I'd like you to meet my sister. Ellen, Joel. Joel's father, Mr. de Asis. -No, it's Dad. -Dad. [laughs] -I'm glad to meet you. -I'm glad to meet you, too. Join us. -Where's Ernesto? -He can't join us. He has work. -Good evening, Mom. -Good evening, dear. Dad... I'm sorry I'm late. I had to put the baby to sleep. Uh, Perla, get Ellen a plate. Uh, and Momoy, maybe she would like a glass of wine, too. [Momoy] Uh, sure, sure. -Manolo, more wine? -[Manolo] Why not? [Elisa] Enough for Joel because he has to get up early tomorrow. [Elisa and Manolo laughing] [Elisa] The boy might get drunk. Where's Joel? He's talking to someone on the phone. Ellen, why did you come here tonight? Dad invited me. I know you have a better reason. This is the first time you came here for an occasion. -Why are you here? -I'm here because of Ernesto. Please, Ellen. Do you love him? I'm referring to Joel. -Of course I love him. -More than you love Ernesto? It's none of your business. Grace, I came here to confess. -What more do I need to know? -A lot. It's all in the past. It isn't! He's already your husband. That's my biggest mistake. You love him and he loves you! It's not a mistake! It's why you had a child together and got married! -Grace... -Please! I don't want you to end up like me. I'll never end up like you. Then don't marry Joel! I don't have time for this. You don't know everything! All I know is that you and Ernesto betrayed me! And I just want to forget that. So please leave me alone. -What's wrong? -Nothing. I have to go. I'm going somewhere. Johnny and the guys want to hang out. -We'll just go to a disco. -It's okay. Come and say goodbye to Mom. No need to, I already did. I'll walk you to your car. [engine starts] Crap! -Crap! -[glass breaks] -Crap! -[glass breaking] If you really love me, why can't you trust me? -I'm going to marry you. -You liar! [priest] Ernesto and Ellen, since you wish to contract holy matrimony, please join your right hands and express your intention before God and His church. Ellen, do you take Ernesto, here present, for your lawful husband, according to the rites of our holy Mother the Church? Yes, I do. Ernesto, do you take Ellen, here present, for your lawful wife, according to the rites of our holy Mother the Church? I do. Now, please say together after me. -Grant us, O Lord... -[both] Grant us, O Lord... -to be one heart and one soul... -to be one heart and one soul... -from this day forward... -from this day forward... -for better, for worse... -for better, for worse... -for richer, for poorer... -for richer, for poorer... -in sickness and in health... -in sickness and in health... -until death do us part. -until death do us part. And I, by the authority of the church, confirm and bless this bond of marriage. [crying] [telephone ringing] -Hello? -Grace... How are you? Why did you call? Have you talked to Ellen? Give her a chance to explain. She has something important to tell you. Please, Grace. I've suffered enough. We should settle things between us before you get married. Yes, we should. [humming] Mm. [giggles] I lied to you. And to Mom and Dad. It isn't true that Ernesto and I love each other. I just fooled you all. I was also a regular at that club... The club where you visited him while telling our parents you're at your classmate's house. That's the place... where he performs. I often went there with my friends. One night, I got him drunk and brought him to a motel. [chuckles] He was even surprised to see that it I was with him. I got pregnant, so he married me. But I don't love him. Do you know why I did it, Grace? Huh, Grace? Because I was so jealous of you. Mom and Dad loved only you. And me? I meant nothing to them. That's why I rebelled against them! I wanted revenge. And because they loved you dearly, I took it out on you. I stole Ernesto from you! Poor guy. He had no idea. Even as a child, I never felt the love of Mom and Dad. I never did anything right. They were always scolding me. But you, you were always right. You're the good daughter. You're the beautiful one. You're the smart one. You're the one who brings them good luck. Why? Is it my fault for being myself? Is it my fault? I'm their daughter too, right? I'm also their daughter!

Ernesto, I'm sorry I accused you of something you didn't do. Did you hear what I said? I love you. I heard you. You know, I was so happy when I met you. I forgot about the gap between us. I forgot about the kind of woman I am. All I know is that I was so happy. It all felt like a dream. But one person brought me back to reality. Who? Why the huge payment? I am the father of Joel de Asis. Now I know. Don't blame your father. He's just concerned about your welfare. Why didn't you tell me? -I couldn't. -Why didn't you try me? It's been five years. But I haven't forgotten. Who has? During that day, when I ran after you at your school and failed to do so, I knew I was never going to see you again. I cried. I was like a fool looking for you. I asked your classmates about you... and your neighbors, but they didn't know where to find you. I searched for so long, and spent sleepless nights just thinking about you, until I grew tired, and stopped searching. I went to the States to study. I had a lot of girlfriends, but you're different. [chuckling] Talk about fate... Of all the women you could be with on your last night as a bachelor, it had to be me. Are you sure you want to do this? You told me... you want something new. Let's see. You okay? Nes, you're on. Wait here. Poldo, get her a glass of... white wine? [saxophone playing] [indistinct chattering] [Ernesto] Grace... Grace! [sobbing] Ernesto, please! Enough! But it wasn't my fault! Don't drag me into this! This isn't just about us anymore. What about your child? And your wife? Why should we drag other people into this? They are part of our lives. Joel... Is he a part of your life too? [Ernesto] Grace? [Grace sobbing] Grace? I know you still love me. Come with me. I have a job offer in Tokyo, and in Hong Kong. We can stay there as long as we like. I'll make you happy, I promise you. You won't regret it. I'm sorry Ernesto! But I love Joel, too. Damn this life! All my life, you're the only person I loved. [sobbing] I didn't even love my damn parents. I only loved you! So if I'd lose you, I would rather die! Ernesto! Ernesto! [Grace] Ernesto! Ernesto! Ernesto! Ernesto! [breathing heavily] [Grace grunts] [laughing] I got you good! You really thought I'd kill myself? I just wanted to see if you still love me. Grace! Grace, wait! Taxi! Let's go! Joel... You're leaving? [indistinct dialogue] May we all stand to start the mass. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Grace, do you take Joel, here present, for your lawful husband, according to the rites of our holy Mother the Church? Yes, I do.
