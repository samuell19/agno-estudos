YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, WHAT MAKES YOUR RIGHTEOUS. ANGRY, EVEN. AND YOU HAVE THIS FIGURED OUT? ABSOLUTELY. GUYS THAT I TAKE DOWN HAVE NO REASON TO BREAK THE LAW, YET THEY'RE THESE OVER-PRIVILEGED, MORALLY BANKRUPT INDIVIDUALS WHO THINK THEY CAN JUST STOMP ON THE WEAK AND THE POWERLESS AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY USUALLY DO. MM. IF I DIDN'T THINK THEY DESERVED TO GO DOWN, COULDN'T TRY THE CASE. DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT. THESE CIGARETTES GO TO MY HEAD. YOU'RE A LIGHTWEIGHT. YEAH, I DON'T -- I DON'T SMOKE.

YOU DON'T THINK THEY'D FIND IT MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE? I THINK THEY PROBABLY UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT QUITE THE TABOO IT USED TO BE. I MEAN, YOU GOT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WATCHING INTERNET PORN. WHAT'S SHE LIKE? YOU MEET HER? IS SHE SEXY? UH...I DON'T KNOW. UH... MM... - YOU TIRED? - YEAH. I JUST -- I HAVE TO BE UP EARLY. CAN I GET A HUG? I THINK I CAN MANAGE THAT. JAMES, YOU READY?

YOU QUIT YOUR JOB AND YOU JUMP IN THE RACE. BUT I GOT TO KNOW NOW WHETHER YOU GOT THE BALLS FOR THIS. I'LL HAVE TO THINK IT OVER. WELL, THINK IT OVER. BUT REMEMBER, I'M THE OTHER WOMAN HERE, SO DON'T KEEP ME WAITING. NOW, NIGEL COAKER'S ALREADY AGREED TO WRITE THE LONGER ARTICLE, WHICH WILL KEEP THINGS ALIVE.

WHY WERE YOU AT THE SAINT REGENCY HOTEL? YOU CAN INTERROGATE ME LATER. JUST LET ME REST. SURE. GIVE YOU TIME TO PREP, RIGHT? JEANNIE, PLEASE. THIS? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? HMM? HUSH MONEY FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND? IT'S, UH -- IT'S A DONATION. YOU DON'T TREAT ME LIKE SOME STUPID SUBURBAN HOUSEWIFE, SAM. I OUTPACED YOU IN EVERY FUCKING LAW CLASS. I WAS EARNING A HIGHER SALARY THAN YOU UNTIL -- FUCK ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. YOU DON'T DO THIS KIND OF THING. NOT TO ME. THE NURSE SAID YOU FRACTURED A RIB. I WOULDN'T MOVE TOO MUCH. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? DO I, UH -- SHOULD I LEAVE? 'CAUSE I WON'T BE THE VICTIM HERE. YOU SAW WHAT THAT DID TO MY PARENTS. I'LL WALK BEFORE THAT HAPPENS. WE'RE NOT YOUR PARENTS. THEN GET IT TOGETHER. IF NOT FOR ME, DO IT FOR JAMES. HE LOOKS TO YOU FOR HOW TO BEHAVE. AND WHATEVER MESS YOU'RE IN, YOU NEED TO DIG YOURSELF OUT OF IT NOW. I'M GOING TO GET OUR SON. YOU'RE WELCOME. We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected Or is no longer in service. HELLO. NOAH, IT'S SAM. I NEED YOU TO CHECK SOMETHING OUT FOR ME. Uh, sure. What's up? NIGEL COAKER CALLED THREE TIMES. I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM. NOAH'S IN YOUR OFFICE WITH THE MEETING YOU ASKED FOR. OKAY. IT'S BEEN MOSTLY FBI SO FAR. WE'VE HANDLED A COUPLE OF WARRANTS. THEY PUT IN A REQUEST FOR A WIRE, BUT I THINK IT'S TOO LATE. THE AGENCY'S ROLLING UP FAST. WHAT DO WE KNOW? SOME INTERSTATE, SOME INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY. FOR THE RIGHT PRICE, A V.I.P. CLIENT COULD BRING A PROSTITUTE TO NEW YORK OR PARIS. AT THE VERY LEAST, I THINK WE'VE GOT THEM ON THE MANN ACT. WE SURE ABOUT THAT? NOT 100%. AND THE AGENTS WANT TO MOVE NOW? WHO'S ON IT? PARK AND STRELLITZ -- SOLID GUYS. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT SLIP AWAY. WELL, I WANT TO COME ON BOARD AND HELP OUT. AND I'LL LEAD THE CASE. IS THERE A REASON YOU WOULD NEED TO, SIR? IS THERE A PROBLEM? NO. IT'S YOUR CALL, OF COURSE. IT'S JUST I WAS HOPING TO TRY THE CASE IF IT CAME TO THAT. I USED TO VOLUNTEER AT A CLINIC THAT HELPED PROSTITUTES GET OUT AND GET CLEAN, AND I SAW A LOT OF GIRLS GO THROUGH THERE. EVEN AT THE HIGH END, THERE'S A PRETTY INTENSE PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL. I THINK WHAT FLYNN IS TRYING TO SAY, SIR, IS THAT WE'D LIKE TO STAY ON THE CASE UNLESS THERE'S A COMPELLING REASON FOR US TO SWITCH. YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR TIME ON THIS? YOU THINK I'M CHASING HEADLINES? IS THAT IT? YOU'RE RIGHT, MS. FLYNN. IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE MORE INVOLVED. I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT STAYS ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AND IF IT GOES TO TRIAL, YOU CAN HAVE THE CASE. FAIR DEAL? ALL RIGHT, TELL THE AGENTS WE'RE TRANSFERRING THE CASE. I WANT TO SEE THEM IN HERE AT THEIR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE. NOAH, HANG BACK A SEC. A BUDDY AT THE BUREAU SLIPPED ME THE LEAD ON THIS, AND I DON'T WANT TO BURN HIM, SO IF ANYONE ASKS, I HEARD ABOUT IT FROM YOU, OKAY? YOU GOT IT, CHIEF. JAMES, HONEY, NO. OTHERWISE, THEY'RE GONNA KEEP YOU BACK IN THAT CLASS. YOU OKAY? YEAH. FINE. SURE. ALREADY READ IT. OKAY. SEE YOU TONIGHT. OKAY. Word is the FBI sent it upstairs yesterday. WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY DO THAT? LOOK, I TALKED TO MY BUDDY AT MAIN JUSTICE. He said they split it. They bumped the case to New York, And the rest is going to OPR, which only happens if someone in this office is implicated, right? JESUS. ANY IDEA WHO THAT MIGHT BE? YOU KNOW, NOAH, I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK. JESUS. - Hey. H-- I know you called. Leave a message. Detective Brixy. Ellis, how you doing, man? You gonna nail Stiegel to the wall? You are a regular fucking hero down here, man. YEAH, I KNOW. THANKS. COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT SOME SOLID POLICE WORK, RIGHT? I-I NEED YOU TO RUN A NUMBER FOR ME. I NEED AN ADDRESS. CAN I HELP YOU? UH, YES. I, UH -- IS JENNIFER HERE? JUST A SECOND. THANK YOU. HI. I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU HERE. UM... IT'S JENNIFER, RIGHT? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE? CAN I COME IN? MY MOM'S IN THERE. IT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT. UH, IS THERE SOMEWHERE ELSE WE CAN TALK, THEN? THEY ALREADY BROUGHT ME IN FOR QUESTIONING THIS MORNING. IT SUCKED. COPS REALLY CREEP ME OUT. WHAT DID THEY ASK YOU? THEY SAID I CAN'T DISCUSS THAT. LISTEN, YOU NEED TO GET A -- A MESSAGE TO THE AGENCY. YOU NEED TO TELL THEM NOT TO VOLUNTEER ANY INFORMATION, OKAY? THE FBI DOESN'T HAVE A CASE. - EVERYBODY'S IN CUSTODY. - IT DOESN'T -- NO, I MEAN THEY GOT EVERY SINGLE PERSON. YOU HAVE TO THINK OF A WAY, THOUGH. THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH SOMEBODY. THERE'S NOTHING. NO, I'M SERB-- - WHAT ABOUT THE BOOK? - THERE'S NOTHING. - THEY'RE GONE. - CAN YOU TEXT SOMEBODY? - ONE OF THE OTHER GIRLS? - WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?! YOU THINK THEY'RE JUST GONNA USE UP THEIR ONE PHONE CALL - TO SEE HOW LACI'S DOING? - JUST THINK! - JUST THINK! JUST THINK! - THE FUCK? - THERE IS NOTHING! - JUST THINK OF EVERYBODY! - THEY ARE GONE! - HELP ME OUT! I NEVER EVEN SPOKE TO THEM IN PERSON. IT WAS ALL JUST OVER THE PHONE. FUCK. I AM SO FUCKED. THIS IS, UH -- SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING. YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. I RECOGNIZED YOU, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE A LOT BETTER-LOOKING IN PERSON THAN YOU ARE ON TV. I WAS GONNA GO POLI-SCI BEFORE MY MOM GOT DIAGNOSED. SHE HAS CANCER, DOESN'T SHE? MY MOM DIED FROM CANCER WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE. YOU GUYS CLOSE? YEAH. SHE WAS KIND OF OUT OF CONTROL. BUT... I JUST GOT INTO THIS TO HELP HER OUT. I'M ALL SHE'S GOT. BUT ONCE YOU'RE AT THE PARTY... YOU SHOULD GET OUT. I-I ALREADY SWITCHED AGENCIES. THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN COURTING ME FOR A WHILE. THEY'RE SUPER-DISCRETE. IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL GOOD, RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE. WAIT. CAN'T WE, UH... I'VE GOT, UH... IT'S ALL I GOT. I CAN GO TO THE BANK AFTER IF YOU WANT. RIGHT HERE? YEAH. SORRY I'M LATE. ALL RISE. THE HONORABLE CATHERINE LIU PRESIDING. WELL, WE'RE OFF TO A ROARING START. APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY, YOUR HONOR. BE SEATED. NOT YOU, MR. ELLIS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE HERE THAT LONG. LET'S HEAR YOUR MOTIONS. RIGHT. UH... HEY, UM, THERE'S TWO FBI AGENTS THAT WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU. I PUT THEM IN YOUR OFFICE. I HOPE THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU, DALIA. AND NEXT FRIDAY'S MY LAST DAY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THAT. LET US KNOW WHERE YOU LAND. MM-HMM. AND I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE. I NEVER MEANT TO COMPLICATE YOUR LIFE OR -- OR YOUR WIFE'S. YOU DIDN'T. - GENTLEMEN. - MR. ELLIS. - SAM ELLIS. - AGENT PARK. I'M AGENT STRELLITZ. AGENT PARK. HAVE A SEAT. YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE? YOU TELL ME. WHY THIS GET PASSED UP TO MAIN? HOW FAMILIAR ARE YOU WITH EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE? UH, NOT VERY. I STEPPED IN 'CAUSE I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT, UH, SOME OF THE WARRANTS Y'ALL ASKED FOR. HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE CASE? UH, NOAH, ONE OF MY A.U.S.A.s TOLD ME ABOUT IT. OUR INVESTIGATION STARTED WITH A PARTICULAR ELECTED OFFICIAL MOVING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY AROUND. WE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE EMBEZZLING FUNDS. TURNS OUT HE WAS A CLIENT AT THE AGENCY. - HMM. - STARTED TO BUILD A LIST. HIGH-PROFILE PUBLIC OFFICIALS, MOSTLY STATE. ALL OF WHOM ARE CLIENTS AND MANY OF WHOM -- AND MANY OF WHOM WERE SOCIAL FRIENDS OF A COLLEAGUE OF YOURS HERE. KIRKLAND? MM-HMM. WE THINK MAYBE THEY ASKED HIM TO HOLD UP THE INVESTIGATION. HAS HE EVER MENTIONED THE CASE TO YOU? UH, NO. NOT AT ALL. HE EVER MENTION THE AGENCY OR PROSTITUTION IN GENERAL? MAYBE THE OCCASIONAL OFF-COLOR COMMENT. WE'RE USING AN ESCORT AS A WITNESS ON AN UNRELATED IDENTITY-THEFT CASE, BUT...I BELIEVE SHE WORKED FOR A DIFFERENT AGENCY. AND YOU YOURSELF HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CONTACT WITH THE AGENCY OR ANY OF ITS EMPLOYEES? NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF. YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL ON TUESDAY. IS THAT CORRECT? YES, I WAS HIT BY A CAR CROSSING THE STREET. THEN YOU PASSED OUT FOUR BLOCKS FROM THE SAINT REGENCY HOTEL. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHERE I PASSED OUT. THE POLICE REPORT COULD CLARIFY THAT. I'D BE CAREFUL HERE, FELLAS. DO YOU HAVE A CASE? 'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE FISHING. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I WANTED TO CHECK THE WARRANTS. IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD ASSIST THE INVESTIGATION, - WE'D BE EXTREMELY -- DO YOU HAVE A CASE? WE SUSPECT THAT SOMEONE TIPPED THE AGENCY. THEY STARTED ROLLING UP, DESTROYED ALL THEIR RECORDS. THAT'S WHY WE MOVED IN. BUT WE THINK WE WERE TOO LATE. OKAY. SO, YOU GONNA CHARGE THEM WITH SOMETHING? NO. WELL, HOPEFULLY YOU'LL GET THEM NEXT TIME. Y'ALL SHOULD'VE COME TO ME FIRST. IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. ARE YOU A MARRIED MAN, MR. ELLIS? 13 YEARS. I'M MARRIED 38 YEARS MYSELF. I'VE SEEN EVERY KIND OF HUSBAND. YOU CAN IMAGINE FOR EVERY SORT OF INDISCRETION. GUYS TELLING THEMSELVES IT'S JUST A LITTLE VACATION FROM REALITY. OR THAT THEY'RE SOME OTHER GUY WHEN THEY STEP INTO THAT ROOM. AND I HAVE SEEN GROWN MEN BREAK DOWN AND CRY WHEN THE CHICKENS COME HOME. EVEN IF YOU'RE GETTING AWAY WITH IT, YOU ONLY GET TO BE ONE PERSON UNDER THE EYES OF GOD. AND THESE GUYS, THEY GOT TO BE ASKING THEMSELVES AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU'RE THE GUY THAT WALKS THROUGH THAT DOOR OR IF YOU'RE NOT. HAVE A GOOD DAY, COUNSELOR. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT JOGGING IS SHIT FOR THE KNEES. SO I HEAR. YOU FOLLOWED ME? YOU WANT TO GRAB A COFFEE? WE NEED TO HAVE A CHAT. HOW'S YOUR LOVELY WIFE? PROBABLY SITTING A LOT MORE THAN I HAVE LATELY. AND I HEARD YOU HAD A VISIT FROM THE FBI TODAY. THEY WERE BRIEFING ME ON A CASE. MM-HMM. IS THAT ALL? THAT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE, UM...MY SOURCES SAID IT WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT. YEAH? WHAT DID THEY SAY? I THINK YOU KNOW. HMM? YOU KNOW THEY HAVEN'T GOT A CASE AGAINST YOU, SAM, AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THE PRESSURE FROM THE TOP WILL GET THEM TO DROP IT. AND FROM WHERE I STAND, I STILL THINK PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THEIR, UM, ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY AND ASPIRING FUTURE CONGRESSMAN. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY THE HYPOCRISY THAT OFFENDS MOST PEOPLE, AND YOU'RE QUITE GOOD AT FOOLING EVERYONE. BUT SOON, PEOPLE ARE GONNA KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY ARE. THEN THEY CAN MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND ABOUT IT. NOW, I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO TELL ME YOUR OWN STORY, AND MAYBE -- MAYBE THEY WILL FORGIVE YOU IF YOU MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND. WHEN ARE YOU RUNNING THE PIECE? SOON. I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AT THIS TIME. EDWARD POLLAN, THE THREE-TERM SENATOR ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT HE INTENDS TO RETIRE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE SESSION. THE UNEXPECTED DECISION LEAVES THE PLAYING FIELD WIDE OPEN GIVEN POLLAN'S 17-YEAR TENURE IN THE OFFICE. NORMALLY ONE OF THE SENATE'S MOST OUTSPOKEN... YEAH. WANT CHEESE ON YOUR BURGER? YEAH. YEAH. HI, MOM. HERE YOU GO. CAN I GIVE JACK A LETTUCE LEAF? SURE. JUST WASH YOUR HANDS, OKAY? SO, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? AROUND. I SAW THE ANNOUNCEMENT. YOU TALK TO HILLER? NOT YET. HE WANTED SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOUR MOTHER FOR THE WEBSITE. THERE'S A BOX IN MY OFFICE. BACK TO BUSINESS. SOMETHING WRONG? NO, SWEETIE. JUST, UM -- JUST HUNGRY. THANK YOU. JUST TAKE YOUR TIME. IF I TALK TO YOU, WILL YOU GIVE ME TIME TO RESIGN AND GET MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER? THAT'S A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS, BUT OKAY. WELL, FIRST, I-I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO MY FAMILY. TO MY WIFE AND SON. AND MY COLLEAGUES AT THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, WITH WHOM IT HAS BEEN A GREAT HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO SERVE. THERE ARE NO EXCUSES. WHY TAKE THE RISK? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT. JEANNIE THINKS THE WORLD OF YOU. OFF THE RECORD. HOW ARE YOU GONNA BREAK IT TO HER? WELL, SHE ALREADY KNOWS, I THINK. YOU THINK? WHY DO WE HOLD PUBLIC SERVANTS TO A -- TO A HIGHER STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO MARRIAGE AND FIDELITY? WE'RE FLAWED LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. I SET OUT TO HELP PEOPLE. I NEVER SAID I WAS BETTER THAN THEM. GO TALK TO YOUR WIFE. JEANNIE, WE NEED TO TALK. IT'S OVER. I'M GONNA RESIGN TOMORROW. WHAT? WHY? COAKER KNOWS. KNOWS WHAT? COME ON, JEANNIE. YOU ALREADY KNOW. WHAT IS IT I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW? YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT? FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS... I'VE BEEN A CLIENT OF AN ESCORT AGENCY. "BEEN A CLIENT"? HOW WOULD YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT? YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO CLEAN. I HAVE BEEN SO AFRAID THAT SOMEBODY WOULD FIND OUT THAT NOW I FEEL I... I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL RELIEVED. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE. WHEN THIS BLOWS OVER, I'LL GET A JOB ON THE CIVIL SIDE. SOMETHING WITH LESS HOURS AND MORE MONEY SO I CAN SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU AND JAMES. MAYBE YOU CAN GO BACK TO PRACTICING LAW, IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED. JEANNIE, I NEED YOUR HELP HERE. I'M SPLITTING APART HERE. - I CAN'T IMAGINE -- JUST SHUT UP! WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? HOW MANY OTHER GIRLS DID YOU FUCK? 5, 10? I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL ME. DO YOU NOT THINK THE WIFE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW? WHAT WAS IT LIKE WITH THEM? I DON'T KNOW, JEANNIE. YOU DON'T KNOW? WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HAVE AN AFFAIR, SAM? THAT WAS MY WORST FEAR ALL ALONG. BUT THAT -- THAT WOULD'VE MADE YOU HUMAN. THIS MAKES YOU SICK THAT YOU VIEW WOMEN THAT WAY. AND THERE ISN'T ONE PERSON I CAN BLAME, NOT ONE BITCH I CAN POINT THE FINGER AT. YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME THAT! SORRY. IF LIFE WITH US WAS SO FUCKING TERRIBLE, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST FUCKING GO? I DIDN'T WANT THAT. I NEVER WANTED THAT. THEN WHAT, SAM? HELP ME UNDERSTAND. WAS OUR ROUTINE SO STIFLING? WAS THAT IT? WAS IT YOUR CRAZY MAMA WHO WANTED YOU TO BE THE NEXT KENNEDY? WAS IT ME? WAS IT MY DAD? I KNOW HE TALKS DOWN TO YOU, BUT HE PUT A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS. HE STARTED YOUR POLITICAL CAREER. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR REMINDING ME. YOU KNOW, I FELT SUFFOCATED, TOO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I DID? I STARTED A FUCKING VEGETABLE GARDEN. BUT YOU... YOU COULDN'T EVEN TALK TO ONE JOURNALIST WITHOUT DESTROYING EVERYTHING WE WORKED FOR. NO, HE ALREADY KNEW, JEANNIE. HE ALREADY KNEW. YOU THINK YOU CAN DO ANY BETTER? I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY. RIDING ME IS NOT THE SAME AS DOING IT YOURSELF. COAKER NEVER LIKED ME. HE WAS DOING THIS FOR YOU AND YOUR FATHER. THIS WAS MY FAULT NOW? SO, WE SHOULD ALL FEEL SORRY FOR YOU?! I NEVER ASKED ANYBODY TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME. PLEASE TELL ME IT WAS WORTH IT FOR THAT FEW MINUTES OF EXCITEMENT. OR IS THAT WHY YOU DID IT? SO YOU COULD HAVE A SECRET FROM ME. FROM EVERYONE WHO BELIEVED IN YOU. WELL, AT LEAST IT WAS MINE. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY, BUDDY. I SUPPOSE YOU'D LIKE TO COME IN. HOW'D YOU FIND OUT? JUST BECAUSE I'M OLD DOESN'T MEAN I'M LAZY. HERE YOU GO. ATTAGIRL. DON'T WRITE THE PIECE. IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE BRINGS HIMSELF DOWN. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO HUMILIATE ME IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE WORLD, IN FRONT OF MY SON. IF IT'S NOT ME, IT'LL BE SOMEONE ELSE EVENTUALLY. LET IT BE SOMEBODY ELSE. WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I? 'CAUSE I'M ASKING YOU TO. I DIDN'T WRITE THE PIECE IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOW IT'S GETTING INTERESTING, AND YOU WANT ME TO STOP. LOOK, I REALIZE IT'S YOUR JOB, BUT IS IT WORTH DESTROYING MY FAMILY TO SELL A FEW FUCKING MAGAZINES? I DIDN'T BREAK THE LAW. WHERE AS YOU, MY DEAR, NOW YOU JUST FOUND OUT YOUR HUSBAND'S FUCKING PROSTITUTES. NOW ALL YOU CAN DO IS DEFEND HIM? HOW MANY STUDENTS DID YOU FUCK IN EXCHANGE FOR BETTER GRADES? I MEAN, IS IT REALLY ANY DIFFERENT? IT'S NOT ABOUT ME, RIGHT? THIS IS ABOUT YOU PROTECTING YOUR TICKET TO THE TOP. I MEAN, THAT'S ALL YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE REALLY BOTHERED ABOUT ANY OF THEM OTHER WOMEN, I MEAN, 'CAUSE YOU JUST LIKE HIM. I MEAN, WHAT DOES HE DO? DOES HE PULL YOUR HAIR? DOES HE TALK FILTH TO YOU? OR ARE YOU CONTENT TO ALLOW HIS YOUNG WHORES TO DO AS THEY WILL WITH HIM? JUST AS LONG AS YOU CAN SIT ON THAT FUCKING THRONE. OH. YOU'RE YOUR FATHER'S GIRL, YEAH? NOW I KNOW I'M DIGGING IN THE RIGHT PLACE. FUCK YOU. ANYTIME, JEANNIE. SINCE YOU WERE 16. ANY FUCKING TIME. OKAY. I BEG YOUR PARDON? CALL IT AN EVEN TRADE. WHAT?

REMEMBER EVERYTHING WE TALKED ABOUT? REMEMBER ALL THE GOALS WE SET FOR OURSELVES? LET'S NOT THROW THAT AWAY. BUT WHAT IF I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE? BIT LATE FOR THAT, DON'T YOU THINK? I DIDN'T THINK YOU HAD IT IN YOU. GO TO HELL, SAM. LET ME ASK YOU ONE THING. WHAT DID THEY HAVE THAT I DON'T? NOTHING. SIR, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? HAVE A SEAT. I KNOW THE FBI ASKED YOU ABOUT ME, SAM. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT WHOLE MESS. THEY WERE JUST GRASPING AT STRAWS. SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GO AFTER POLLAN'S SEAT. WELL, I HAVEN'T OFFICIALLY DECIDED ANYTHING YET. JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M ALL FOR IT. WE NEED GUYS LIKE YOU IN D.C. STILL SEE THINGS CLEARLY. BEEN AT IT AS LONG AS I HAVE, EVERYTHING LOOKS GRAY AND MURKY. THANK YOU, SIR. FUCKING "A." LOOK AT THAT. WOW. HMM. BETTER THAN WE COULD'VE IMAGINED. SENATOR? SENATOR? YOUR WIFE JUST CALLED. SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE IT ON TUESDAY, BUT SHE'LL BE COMING DOWN FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BALL ON SATURDAY. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FINE. JUST MAKE SURE SHE HAS A PICK UP AT THE AIRPORT. YES, SIR. DO YOU WANT US TO COME IN WITH YOU? NO. WE HAVE SOME PRIVATE BUSINESS TO DISCUSS. YOU GO HAVE LUNCH. I'LL CALL YOU WHEN WE'RE FINISHED. SENATOR. GEORGE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. COFFEE? NO. KICKED THE HABIT. EVERYTHING IN MODERATION, HUH? THAT'S RIGHT. HOW'S THE FAMILY? YOUR SON DOING ALL RIGHT? CAN'T RUN HIM FOR CONGRESS TILL HE'S 25. WELL, WE'LL SEE. SO, YOU LIKING IT UP HERE? WELL, JEANNIE DOESN'T LOVE IT, BUT HER CHARITY KEEPS HER AT HOME MOSTLY. I LIKE D.C. IT SUITS ME. GOOD. 'CAUSE YOU MIGHT BE HERE FOR A LONG TIME IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT. REELECTION CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS ARE OPENING UP NEXT WEEK, AND I TALKED TO THE GOVERNOR THIS MORNING. YOU CAN EXPECT A FORMAL ENDORSEMENT. GLAD TO HEAR IT. SAM, I DO WANT TO TALK TO YOU, THOUGH, ABOUT YOUR... YOUR ZIPPER PROBLEM. NOW, IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. AND, UH, I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME. BUT THE DAY YOU SIGNED ON FOR THIS, YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON PROBATION. YOUR TIME ON THIS PLANET AS A HUMAN BEING WHO EATS AND SHITS AND FUCKS LIKE THE REST OF US, THAT'S OVER. YOU GOT A PATRIOTIC DUTY TO BE SQUEAKY CLEAN FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO WOULD TURN ON YOU ON A DIME, AND THAT IS THE CONTRACT. THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE WHO WANT THE TRUTH... IN A COURTROOM. BUT OUTSIDE, THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE SOMEHOW BETTER THAN THEY ARE. THEY NEED THAT FAIRY TALE. IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT SOCIETY HAS TO KEEP IT FROM SINKING INTO THE MUCK. THAT AND WISE POLICY. IT'S UNDER CONTROL. THAT'S ALL BEHIND ME NOW. WELL, THAT'S -- THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO HEAR. I SUPPOSE THAT, UH, IF WE RULED OUT EVERY CANDIDATE WHO EVER STEPPED OUT ON HIS WIFE, IT'D BE JUST PUSSY-WHIPPED NERDS RUNNING THE COUNTRY. WE DON'T WANT THAT, DO WE? PEOPLE STILL NEED HEROES. LET'S GIVE THEM ONE. GOOD. NOW, HERE'S THE FIRST ROUND OF DONATIONS FROM OUR FRIENDS, AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING. AND, UH, SAM, I WOULDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON ETHICS REFORM RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE A LOT OF PROMISES ON THAT. AND BESIDES, YOU GOT A LOT OF OTHER SUBJECTS THAT YOU CAN TACKLE FIRST. WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, GEORGE, BUT I CAN HANDLE TWO THINGS AT ONCE. YOU ARE A QUICK STUDY, ELLIS. YOU'LL DO ALL RIGHT.
