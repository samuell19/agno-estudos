Why don't you marry LuIu, Father? One doesn't marry such women! It wouId be suicide! What did she want here? I beIieve she wants to break into show business.

END OF ACT FOUR ACT FIVE Your Honors... I've painted a bIeak picture of a tragic Iife. GentIemen of the jury, Iook at this woman. Have I not shown that this woman did not commit murder, that her husband was the victim of tragic circumstances? Has the son of the deceased not spoken in her defense? No, this unfortunate woman is no murderess. You must acquit her, for she is innocent! Your Honors and gentIemen of the jury! The Greek gods created a woman - Pandora. She was beautifuI and charming, and versed in the art of fIattery. But the gods aIso gave her a box containing aII the eviIs of the worId. The heedIess woman opened the box, and aII eviI was Ioosed upon us. CounseI, you portray the accused as a persecuted innocent. I caII her Pandora, for through her aII eviI was brought upon Dr. Schön! The arguments of defense counseI do not sway me in the Ieast. I demand the death penaIty! CounseIor, do you know what wouId have become of your wife if as a chiId she'd had to spend her nights in cheap cafés? ...is sentenced to five years in prison for mansIaughter, minus 4 1/2 months for time aIready served.

PASSPORT - COUNTESS AUGUSTA GESCHWITZ I have the Iady's baggage. 5,000 MARKS REWARD ''RECEIVED WITH THANKS - MARQUIS CASTI PIANI'' May I prove my friendship by offering some good advice? Don't go to Paris - too many prying eyes. Come with me instead. I know a pIace that's hospitabIe and discreet. END OF ACT SIX ACT SEVEN And LuIu's stayed here the whoIe three months? It's a fine hoteI - hospitabIe and discreet! What can I say? It's our IiveIihood. I just got engaged. I'm going to stage a fantastic variety act with my fiancée. We just need 20,000 francs for sets and costumes. You must get me that money! Ask AIwa for it. Perhaps he won today. If I couId just keep on pIaying, I'd win it aII back. That Iucky deviI gets everything! You shouId onIy pIay when you're sure you'II win. How much? 300 pounds! The German poIice wouId give me 250 pounds any day. Three hundred it is, then. I'II go book a cabin. He's acting Iike he wants to buy me. I need money badIy, and you have none to give me. The Egyptian wiII give me 50 pounds more than the German poIice. You're in Iuck! I'm Iooking out for your future. The poIice wiII never Iook for you at his estabIishment in Cairo. Hurry and get dressed. You Ieave in an hour. I won't be soId. That's worse than prison. I need the money. If you're not ready in an hour, I'm caIIing the poIice! AIwa, you have to win... or eIse I'm done for. I'm warning you: If I don't have those 20,000 francs by tonight, I'm turning you in! Money... they aII want money! Go ahead and cry, my chiId. Rodrigo wants to turn me in. Save me! I'II take care of him. I know how we can aII get out of this mess. Countess Geschwitz is sweet on you, and she has money. Be nice to her and she'II cough up the dough for sure.

PoIice! Let's get out of here! I'II get a boat! PoIice! PoIice! We must find a ship to take us to London! END OF ACT SEVEN ACT EIGHT We take onIy to give to others. Brother, how can I heIp you? No one can heIp me! It's strange how you can get booze on credit... but not bread. Why aII the paint? We Iike you just the way you are. Too bad. I'd have Iiked to taste Christmas pudding once more before I die. WARNING TO THE WOMEN OF LONDON! FOR SOME TIME NOW... A MAN HAS BEEN LURING WOMEN INTO DARK PLACES IN ORDER TO MURDER THEM.
