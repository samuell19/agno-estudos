THE BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY THE PAST DOES NOT EXIST, IN THAT IT HAS ALREADY GONE. THE FUTURE DOES NOT EXIST EITHER, AS IT HAS YET TO COME. THEREFORE, ONLY THE PRESENT EXISTS, BUT IT CAN BE MADE UP OF BOTH THE PAST AND THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT IS THE POINT WHERE THEY MEET. SARAH'S MOTHER HER HUSBAND LAWYER GIORGIO'S FATHER GIORGIO'S MOTHER Look, the storm is over! Come on. It's going to pour any moment now. Come on. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve... - It's late, Federica. Let's go. - Only a few minutes, please. Fifteen... - Watch out for the gearshift. - Sure, I'm watching. - You turned the headlights on. - I'm sorry. - You're so silly. That's the windshield wiper. - This car is too small. You're right. It's too small. I need air. Duck! Final call for Air France flight 312 for Paris, Los Angeles, Papeete, Numea. Now boarding at gate seven. Ladies and gentlemen, Alitalia... - Watch your step, please. - He's drunk. Then he shouldn't drink. After Rivera, Riva and Boninsegna, we would love to know from Chinaglia what he thinks about the attitude of a few players about the football strikes. How about that, Chinaglia? - I think it's right... - You should tell the public, too... It's a big issue for all fans. A lot of players don't earn very much. Stars are the only players who get paid a lot. So many players can end up with nothing. The most famous ones are trying to protect the weak ones. This is what you mean, right? It seems to me that this behavior... Dad and football... It sucks. You shouldn't talk with your mouth full, Sarah. The crime was discovered today at 6:30 P. M. A 17-year-old young girl was raped and killed by a sex offender. A French girl. Her name was Fran?oise Pigaut. - Oh, my God. - She was a friend of yours. Federica, an eight-year-old child, was the first to find the body. The park was surrounded by the police. The officers began a thorough search, but the killer eluded the police, also taking advantage of the downpour. Forensic investigators, summoned by Inspector Berardi, have begun their investigation which should lead to the killer's identity. The major obstacle is the rain. All clues could have been washed away. It seems right now that the crime was committed halfway up a hill and that the stabbed body of the poor girl rolled down the hill. The bruises on the body seem to validate this theory. This is a rubber sole footprint. Everybody wears rubber sole shoes when it rains. Inspector, I've found this record with the books. With her name on it and today's date. What is it? Pop music? Tchaikovsky. Piano Concerto No. 1. A good version. So far, Inspector Berardi and his men have little concrete evidence. A Switchblade knife as the alleged murder weapon and a statement from a witness who saw a man running in the park and climbing the boundary wall as the police were coming. It was raining and I was closing my window. I saw it all. More or less. It was getting dark and from the third floor, you couldn't recognize your own son, so I didn't see much. He was running like someone was chasing after him. Go on. He was young. The wall was quite high to be climbed over like that. It's bitter. - So what? - He had a beige coat. I mean... A raincoat. I mean... A coat. Beige. You know? The fingerprints on the Switchblade are very clear. Maybe too clear. They're comparing the fingerprints against the ones on file. - It will be useless. - Why? Why? Because, the way I see it, the killer can be one of two kinds. If this is a psychotic episode, the killer won't have a police record, and if he's a sex maniac... If he's a maniac, he'd have had gloves or he would have wiped his fingerprints. We found these tickets in the girl's pocket and in the books she was carrying. She saved them all. Every bus and subway she took in the last three weeks. But none of them carries the date of that fatal Friday afternoon. Five stab wounds, two of which were fatal. The first three stabs were struck from bottom to top. The last two, from top to bottom, while the victim was already falling. - Any sign of sperm? - No. She wasn't abused sexually. The victim struggled with the killer and scratched him. We found traces of epithelial tissue under her fingernails but it won't help us. We only know for sure that the killer is Caucasian. The back of the girl's jacket was covered in mud because she was laying on the ground. Now we're trying to find out what might have caused the other stains. We're ready for the spectrographic analysis. After a few comparative tests and by process of elimination, we know these are pleather spots. These are recent. The cleaner confirmed it was handed back in the morning. Following the evidence and our imagination, we can reconstruct the day of the crime. We know for sure that the girl knew her killer. A girl like that doesn't go on a date with a stranger at 6:00 P.M. - What do you think? - I agree. It's too sweet. That Friday she probably had a date. She had a record with her. Maybe a gift for the person she had a date with. Let's say she was about to take the subway when someone she knew in a car offered her a lift. How can you know that? We know she went to take the subway with a school friend who left her in San Babila. We know she didn't take the subway because the ticket is not with the other ones. At that point she gets in the car. It's been raining all day and her jacket is wet. So when she leans back against the car seat, the pleather stains it. I like the way you illustrate things. Let's say the driver gives her a lift to the park. They stop near the park and they get out of the car. Maybe she wants to take a walk or the killer wants to stop awhile. The girl had her books and the record with her. Her place was 50 kilometers from there, which of course means that the record she bought was not for whoever took her there, that she was about to leave and that she had a date in the park with someone else. Right. She would have left the record in the car if she wasn't meeting someone. - How is it? - Good. And since she gets there early due to that ride, maybe the man offers to wait there with her. To be safely delivered to the person she had a date with. No, this is too strong. We're back at square one. Who killed her? The person who gave her a lift or the one waiting for her in the park? One of them tried to take advantage of her and she resisted. In the struggle, she dropped her books and the record. She must have threatened the man, maybe to tell the police. The man panicked and took out the switchblade that for some reason he had in his pocket and killed her. Wait a minute. Let's say the man in the car and the one she had a date with are two different people, why hasn't the innocent one come forward? It could also have been a third man. A maniac, an impotent. In that case, we have to pray for a miracle. We would be chasing shadows, as the newspapers are saying these days. Do you want a coffee? - Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - A little bit more. - Hello. Go up with the dolly. Until that mark. Lower that boom. I'm going to give you the scope. - Is your hand better? - Thanks to you. I took good care of you. - Are you ready, Sandro? - Whenever you want. - Are we ready to roll? - Ready to roll. Raoul, wipe the sweat, please. - The C camera and the B camera are ready. - Thanks. One. Ready to roll in 15 seconds. Athletics, discus throw. Broken record for American athlete Ted Bryan. The Kennedy Stadium... I know who the murder is. I recognized him. I'm Gabriella Giusti. All right, Madam... Miss... The Inspector is in a meeting. - You'll have to wait. - Why? What for? Listen to me and the case will be solved. Why should I wait? - Here. - Thanks. - How is it? - Good. So you're saying that you were in the park that day with a young fellow and you saw the killer. I was trying to remember who that guy was. Last night I went over to my girlfriend's place to watch television and by accident, I discovered who the murderer was. You see, Inspector. I don't have a TV. It bores me too much. Are you sure? May I call my lawyer? Yes? Speaking. Yes, sure. That's bad. Don't worry. I'll be right over. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Look at this. Maybe it's because I'm an agent, but I only like light-colored raincoats. Sandro feels that way, too, Inspector. But now he has to wear the dark one. I had to take the beige one to the cleaner's. It was all muddy. Alessandro Marchi. Look at him! Look at him, ladies and gentlemen of the jury! He's accused of murdering a 17-year-old girl, Fran?oise Pigaut. After attempting to rape her, he killed her in the most brutal manner, stabbing her five times. What feeling can we have for this man? Maybe pity. But we're not here for that. Our purpose is to see that justice is done. That justice is done before mankind and before God. After this long interrogation and all the depositions, we know we have hard evidence against him. I will summarize this briefly for you now. Looking at the fingerprint of the defendant's index finger, you can easily detect a white mark which is indicative of a scar. The scar is even more evident in this enlargement of his fingerprint. Comparing Alessandro Marchi's fingerprints with those found on the murder weapon, we can see they match. As it has been confirmed by the forensic investigators. Therefore, the fingerprints on the knife could only have been made by Alessandro Marchi. Furthermore, his car has pleather seats, and the stains found on the girl's jacket were caused by the same material. You heard three eyewitnesses testify that the killer wore a light beige raincoat. And the accused has the same kind of raincoat. Which he was in a hurry to have cleaned because it was "all muddy". Unfortunately, this precaution proved useless. The fabric absorbed traces of soil which were sufficient for a spectrographic analysis. The analysis confirmed that that soil is that of the park where the young French girl was killed. Due to its proximity to an industrial zone, this soil contains distinctive quantities of potassium, zinc, calcium and cadmium that permit unquestionable identification. And Alessandro Marchi knew the victim very well. Fran?oise Pigaut had often been in Marchi's home in Bergamo to study with Sarah Marchi, his daughter. They were classmates in Milan. Fran?oise even spent some nights there. That explains why Alessandro Marchi, once rejected by the girl and threatened by a scandal, had to kill her to silence her. As if that were not enough, we have the deposition of Gabriella Giusti, who was in that park that afternoon and recognized the man running away. That man was Alessandro Marchi. Mr Marchi conveniently has no alibi for that Friday. "I was just taking a walk." And we should believe him! It's quite rare to have so much convincing and massive evidence accumulated against a person accused of a crime. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you have the duty to convict and condemn this man to life imprisonment for a brutal and illogical crime. All the irrefutable evidence points to him, to the accused, to Alessandro Marchi. The hearing is set for tomorrow at 10:30 A.M. Those two years you spent in Paris seemed endless. You know what? I've always loved you, but you never even noticed me. I noticed you. I remember you. You had short hair and you were going to the Suardi School. It's the opposite. I had long hair and I was going to the Petteni. Yes, you're right. Long and on your shoulders. Like Lady Godiva. I wore my hair in braids. My mother made me. - Now we know each other. - It's never too late. - Do you wanna hear the echo? Sarah. - Giorgio. Thanks for what you did. Why? I only told the truth. Are you sure of it? But I swore to it in court. We don't always swear the truth. Look at this. Thanks for the ride. You made Mom happy. Our family motto reads, "Born a bastard to become a king." I won't have the chance to be a king, but I wasn't lucky enough to be a bastard either. No offence, Dad. - Giorgio, can we have a drink? - Sure. It's a nice place. You're studying difficult things. - I already know you're eclectic. - Sorry. It's not your fault. You've always been the top of the class. The world is changing... When I was your age, places like this were the servants' quarters. Today they house young protesters with big bank accounts. Sharp and funny as always... But I don't ask for anything of yours. It's very simple. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't even exist. And this bothers you. Sure. But you didn't say no to your uncle Giorgio's money. And that is my reality. It's true. And that weighs on me. What difference does it make? It would weigh on me anyway, one way or the other. The concept is the same, though. Everything that surrounds me and everything that you and people like you have taught me and shown me makes me sick. Using a euphemism... It's only shit! I excuse your colorful language, but it makes sense. For a person who passes by in the street you're one of the lucky ones. But you're desperate. And you can't even lift a finger to raise above your despair. Another glass of whisky? Yes. Don't worry. I'm going to talk about you. We already agreed on that. Everything is going to be alright. Bye. Let's look at the different prosecution points. According to the prosecutor, the fingerprints on the switchblade knife match with the ones of Alessandro Marchi and it's true. No one can deny that. But don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, what the defendant said. That Switchblade knife is mine, it's true. But my car was robbed two weeks before. They took that knife, the radio and a black leather bag. And as you know I brought to your attention a detail of great interest, which the prosecutor chose to ignore. Another fingerprint is clearly superimposed over the one of the defendant. The forensic investigators established it was made by pigskin gloves. So if the murderer took the simple precaution of putting on a pair of pigskin gloves, the only fingerprints on the knife handle would be the ones of the defendant. As for the dark stains found on the girl's jacket, I would like to quote a report from the Ministry of Transport which states that 28% of all Italian cars have black pleather seats. This means that, only in this region, we have... Wait, I want to get it right. 326,507 cars with pleather seats. That explains the inconveniences with traffic we all know. Now let's proceed with the key points which the prosecutor has declared as hard evidence. First, the fact that a man from the third floor saw another man with a beige raincoat climbing the park wall cannot even be taken into consideration. We all know that in public parks we have Voyeurs, thieves, homosexuals and perverts. They all run away when they hear police sirens. On the other hand, the defense brought here witnesses who also swear to having seen someone. A man who didn't look like Alessandro Marchi. I was walking along the park on my way to meet some friends. Suddenly I heard police sirens through the main gate. I was at the south gate. I went into the park just out of curiosity. It was raining a lot. A young man, with blonde hair and a blue raincoat, ran into me. He seemed upset. He was clearly running away from something. He got into a dark green car. - Thanks for what you did. - Why? I only told the truth. And now let's talk about the infamous muddy raincoat. It's been established beyond a doubt by special examination that the soil surrounding chemical industries often contains big amounts of potassium, zinc, calcium and cadmium. Therefore, when you heard Mr Marchi state under oath that his raincoat was muddied by a passing car in another area near an industrial complex, it's quite feasible. As you can easily verify. As for the deposition of the prosecution key witness, Mrs... Excuse me, Miss Giusti. I think I've already questioned her credibility. - With your permission, Your Honor. - Proceed. Could you please remove the makeup near your eyes? You wear glasses, don't you? Well, sometimes. I'm a little short-sighted and contacts bother me. One more question. Did you ever meet the defendant before? - No, never... - No? And maybe you didn't know that Mr Marchi wore a toupee for his TV appearances. Well, I didn't know... And in the park he was wearing a hat. You can't see a toupee through a hat. And so that Friday evening, at dusk, without her glasses, for obvious reasons, Miss Giusti says she was able to see the running murderer with his hat pulled down low and that she recognized him as the defendant. Yes, that's him. I've already told the court that during the investigation, I personally ran a test with Inspector Berardi and the investigating judge to prove the credibility of Miss Giusti's testimony, who claimed that Alessandro Marchi was the man who, in that park, that Friday afternoon of April 26, was running away after killing Fran?oise Pigaut. Bottom line, the results of the 10 tests we ran are that the witness recognized the defendant three times, was uncertain three times and four times mistook someone else for him. At this point, it must be evident to all of you that the hard evidence of the prosecutor just collapsed. Or, at the very least, raised a reasonable doubt. Yes, I know, we still have an obscure point. One might well ask, "Where was Alessandro Marchi on that infamous Friday?" I can prove my client has an airtight alibi. And for that reason I request from the court permission to interrogate Anna Bellini. Objection, Your Honor. This procedure is highly irregular. And I also find quite strange that Mr Marchi has waited all this time to give us an explanation of his whereabouts that Friday. An innocent person always hopes not to reveal facts that could compromise him. And Alessandro Marchi is innocent. Your Honor, the defendant only tried to protect the honor of his family. And this is no crime. The court will recess to discuss this new motion. Poor Dad. He's the only one who really loves me. - Give me a cigarette, please. - Where are they? On that table. Who knows what will happen? I'm afraid for him. You came hereto avoid thinking about it. You're right. But now I need something. Or someone. Are you sure you're not just looking for a justification? No, I don't think so. I'll play a record for you. Fran?oise had everything. And that gave her self-confidence that I don't have. She was in love, too. He lives here, but she never introduced him to me. She never talked about him. As she was afraid to talk about their love. They met last year in France. When was the last time you saw Mr Marchi? That Friday. The day the French girl was killed. I've checked the receipts. Can you cover your legs, please? - Sure. - Thanks. What did the defendant buy in your store of intimate garments for women? A black silk robe. I suggested a white chiffon nightgown, but he preferred the black one. Do you recall the size, by any chance? 12. Mr Marchi, do you recall your wife's size? So can you tell us who it was for? Since the defendant seems reluctant to answer, I see no point in continuing this trial as the defense requested. Sandro, now you have to say where you spent that Friday afternoon. Nothing could be worse than allowing everyone, including your wife, to think that you're a murderer. Now you have to talk, Sandro. You're right. That Friday afternoon, I went to see my mistress, Marta, Marta Clerici. As I did every Friday. I got there at 3:00, 3:30 P.M. at the latest. I had a present for her. That black robe. I like giving her presents but she'd had one drink too many, as usual. - Won't you open it? - Yes, but not now. So that I can pretend you're here when you're not. I drank too much last night. The glass she always carried broke and a sliver got stuck in her palm. It bled a lot. - I remember it well. - So that's how your shirt got blood on it. Marta Clerici. Unemployed. Single, rich and free. She could be with one of her rich friends. She's long gone. She owes me money but I'm not worried. Do you remember the last time you brought her milk and newspapers? Sure, I keep a record and I can tell you for sure. Let's see. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Friday April 26. - Thanks. That's what I wanted to know. - Wait a second, Inspector. That's the day I found the milk and the newspapers from the day before, so I suppose she left the day before. On Thursday. How did you find the shirt? The wife hadn't thrown it away. It was in a chest of drawers. She probably forgot about it. - Look, Inspector, now it reacts. - So what? Group B, Rh negative. The same blood type as Fran?oise Pigaut. Aware of the responsibility you assume under oath before God and man, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? - Do you swear? - I swear. With your permission, Your Honor. Mrs Marchi, is it true that on the evening of Friday April 26, your husband came home with a shirt spotted with blood and told you it came from his having helped an injured employee at the television studio? I don't recall. But that bloody shirt belongs to your husband, right? I don't know... Didn't you carefully hide that shirt so that the police couldn't find it at first? Or do you want us to believe that the shirt doesn't belong to anyone in your family? - I don't know... - Mrs Marchi! That shirt has the initials of your husband. AM. Alessandro Marchi. And that blood belongs to the same group of Fran?oise Pigaut. Will you tell us what you know or not? Your silence is more eloquent than any reply. ALESSANDRO MARCHI SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT - La Notte, please. - Here. We're finally free and together. I don't like how it ended. For us, it's the perfect ending. We should send a thank-you letter to the prosecutor. I lost the trial, but it's not my fault. Now I'm a great lawyer and you're here with me. - If I hadn't kept that shirt... - I'm glad you did. We would have kept sneaking around and a killer would have walked around free. Don't say that. I can't believe that Sandro... Sandro... Sandro, Sandro, Sandro. - There's too much light. - I like to see you when we make love. You scared me. You shouldn't be scared. There's no reason for it. It's late. I have to go. We shouldn't see each other for a while. There's another woman, isn't there? I'm going to call you, okay? Sarah? I'd like to know where she was. She's so cute. Now you like young girls? I'm wondering how she'll react when she'll find out about you and me. I don't wanna think about that right now. I'm too happy. I love your lips. Now I have to go. I have to get up early tomorrow. At 8:00, I have to be in court. - Good evening, sir. - Fill her up, please. Sure. Here's another one. Loredana Minucci, prostitute, 26 years old. Five stab wounds. Two were the fatal ones. No fingerprints on the Switchblade knife. Big deal. It figures. There's a resemblance to the case of Fran?oise Pigaut. And here's the question: "ls the accused in jail innocent?" That man killed a whore, you killed a school girl. God bless the faggots. They don't kill anyone. Stop it. You punched me. Are you crazy? - I was only joking... - Hey, what's going on in there? Are you fighting? At least this time nobody can say it was Dad who killed that bitch. Sarah! Why Sarah? Because I said "bitch" - or because Dad could get out of jail? - Don't be ridiculous. You seem glad he's in prison. It's not easy to discover you've been betrayed for all that time. - By a man you trusted so much. - Well said. Hello. Giorgio? This is not true! This new killer is only a man without imagination. But the murder weapon is the same. - And also the place... - It could be plausible. You're right. But there's a big difference between the two crimes. - It's getting cold. - I beg your pardon. - It's cold. - That's what I said. The first victim was a decent girl. The second one is a prostitute. In the first case, the motive was clearly sexual. But this reason does not apply to the second crime. A little money would have left him satisfied with a girl like that. How far did you come with the investigation? Well... It seems that the last people to see her alive were two of her co-workers. The girl left her usual place with the excuse that she had a date. The two girls have also declared that another car followed the Minucci girl's car. But they can't say if it was a coincidence or not. Giulio, please, get me out of here. I'm doing my best to speed up the plea, but it's not easy. I don't know if I can face all this. Be brave. Everything is going to be okay. Now sign this. Good morning, Master Giorgio. It took no less than your birthday to bring you back to us. How are you doing in school? Mother, I quit school two years ago. Really? Maybe you should leave for a while. This suburban life is so sad... Especially for young people. You should go back to France, to Paris. You lived in Paris a long time. You've plenty of friends there. Look! Your birthday cake. Happy birthday. BRERA SQUARE TODAY CULTURE BELONGS TO A GIVEN STATUS. THERE'S NO ART FOR ART'S SAKE, ART BEYOND STATUS. Sorry to bother you, Inspector. There's a guy on the phone who wants to talk to you. His voice seems disguised and he claims he murdered the two girls. - Try to locate the call. - That is what I was going to do. Inspector Berardi. I'm a smart guy, Inspector. I'm smarter than all of you. I've already killed twice and I got away with it. I won't stop. I'll kill again. I'm going to kill again soon, Inspector. Hello? Hello? The phone call was too short. We could not trace it. It's incredible. But maybe... We can't patrol the park day and night. But we have a clue. The two identical Switchblade knives. - Any news about that? - We sent a message to all the shops. Let's hope someone turns up. Giulio! Giulio! Giulio... Let me go... Stop it! Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Stop it! No! Leave me alone! Hi, Maria. I was helping Sarah with her homework. Maria, don't be so dramatic! You think you can have whatever you want! Whatever you like, you grab it and you don't give a damn who you hurt. - You know you're pretty when you're angry. - Yes, but Sarah is prettier and younger. Now that you're old, you like teenagers. All men like young girls. They're so adorable. For us they're like a shot at happiness. You're trying to convince me that you're right? You're such a master at convincing against evidence. I'm a great lawyer. Why, Giulio? Let's go on that bridge! I'll beat you! Let's just sit here. - Do you know where babies come from? - No. No! No! - Hello. - Hello. No! I said no. You have to marry me first. THE PARK MURDERER STRIKES AGAIN Alitalia Airlines flight AZ412 from Singapore, Bangkok, Teheran, Rome. Please claim luggage at the baggage counter number four. I petition the court to reopen the trial under Article 520 to hear the testimony of Marta Clerici who was unable to appear in the previous session due to her absence from Italy. Do you recall seeing Alessandro Marchi, I guess you know him, that Friday April 26? Sure, he was with me. Just like any other Friday. He helped me bandage my hand and we made love. - Does it hurt? - You're the one hurting me. There's blood on your shirt. I have a nice surprise for you. Hi. And he stayed all day. Yes. All day. - Are you sure? - Even if I drink, I have a good memory. One more question. What's your blood type? The small amount of blood I have in my whisky is Group B, Rh negative. Could you pass me some wine? - Why don't you eat, Sarah? - I'm not hungry. Eat something... Okay, Dad. Now I have to go. I have a date and it's quite late. Good bye. - Here it comes, Inspector. Sweet and strong. - Fingers crossed. What's the matter? Are you still not sure that Marchi is innocent? Yes, I am. Sweet, strong and hot. - Yes? - The lady from the shop is here. Okay, I'm coming. Come on. Yes, I sold two of those switchblade knives to the same person. - You know who he is? - Sure, he lives near me. This way, Inspector! You, there. You come with me. Ring the bell. Excuse me, madam. Did someone enter the courtyard? - If the gate is closed, no one came in. - Can we just have a look? - I'll call my husband. - Madam, we're with the police. I don't care. I'm going to call my husband anyway. Giulio won't be here for dinner tonight? No, he's busy. He's always so busy... Never mind. I'll go. Hello. Speaking. That's crazy. But... Yes. Okay. I got it. Okay. I'll be there in half an hour. I knew you would come. - Now say you're a murderer. - I'm a murderer. - Louder. - I'm a murderer. I killed twice to get you free. And now you're here with me. I saw you running away that day, but I didn't know from what. Fran?oise was mine and you killed her! Why did you do that? How could you? Leave me alone! Let me go! I'll tell everyone! I'll tell your wife and Sarah! I'll tell everyone! Let me go! Let me go! I couldn't hear her any more. I couldn't stand it. She had to stop screaming. THE PRODUCTION THANKS THE POLICE FORENSIC ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR KIND ASSISTANCE
