I searched the internet constantly. "Surgical breast removal", "How to make breasts smaller", "Breast removal". I wasn't searching for trans-related surgeries yet. I just really hated my breasts. I hated being classified as female because of them. I started puberty when I went to middle school. That's when most girls start to get breast buds and people can see them. I was repulsed by them and even grossed out. So I would shower in the dark. When I explained to my mom that I often felt that my gender was male. She said, "Aren't you just confused because you're young?" "Don't you just want to be a man" "since women are discriminated against in society?" I was miserable. I resented my mom. HANKYEOL THEY / THEM Hearing that my child was transgender, I felt confused at first. I had no idea when they were young that they were transgender. I saw that they behaved more like a boy and I understood that much. But when they talked about wanting to be a boy or wishing they didn't have breasts I just thought they hated being born female and wanted to become male because of that. That's how I saw it. NABI HANKYEOL'S MOTHER SHE / HER Before I came out to my parents first I told them I wanted to study abroad. After realizing I was gay I think I had something like a final line of defense in my mind. YEJOON HE / HIM Living abroad I could be away from my family. I thought I could live more freely as a gay man. That's what I thought. When I finally decided to come out to my parents I became resolved to do it even if they never spoke to me again. The night my child came out by letter of course I couldn't eat at all. I'd fall asleep for a few hours but wake up and read the letter again. And I'd cry some more. What should I say to him first? How do you even start that conversation? So I texted him. I said I was both sad and confused. That I didn't know what to do. That's how it went. Then I said, it's my fault that you were born with such a difficult life ahead of you. VIVIAN YEJOON'S MOTHER SHE / HER COMING TO YOU Everyone, check your gear for the night shift. - Get to it! - Yes, ma'am! I'm Eunae Jeong and I am 55 years old. My nickname is Nabi. I've been a firefighter for 34 years. I'm currently working in North Jeolla Province. My child is a sexual minority. So I'm also an active member of PFLAG Korea. At any rate you should check the pressure on the first day each week. Perform your routine safety check every other day. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven! My child introduces themself as transgender to others. But recently they refer to themself as genderqueer, non-mono, and ace polyamorist. All these terms are too hard for me to understand. - That's all for today. - Nice work. When my child said, "Mom, I want to get surgery" at first I thought, "What is this?" "Transgender? Then that means becoming a man." "Then would they like women?" "Or would they like other men?" These were things I never thought about before. Honestly, I was so confused. The truth is I didn't know my own child. They didn't talk about it with me. If they did, I wouldn't understand because I never lived that life. Some things they couldn't share with me. As a parent, I didn't know what to say. Should I press the issue? Or just wait? That was the frustrating part. I broke down and cried to my mom. Saying this is a world where it wouldn't be weird if I end up stoned to death. I was shaking when I said it, "I want to get this surgery." I talked about wanting surgery for a while. But my mom was always against it, saying I couldn't do such a thing. It was like she thought, "It just isn't right". At the time, I was hurt because she was denying my very identity. I became severely depressed because I couldn't get the surgery. But even when I thought of ending my life the main reason that kept me from doing it was that it would mean I would die as a woman. I hated that. I've worked as a flight attendant for the past 27 years. My job enables me to meet a lot of different people. Flight attendants gossip all the time. You hear things like, "Look at that gay couple!" You see it all the time. In general, they are quite friendly. They say hello and greet you with a big smile. They are very stylish too. Still, not even 0.0001% of me ever imagined my son would be gay. People can be so dumb, you know. Why did I never consider my son could be gay? Now that I look back, I was just so clueless about this topic. I also used to try to take another peek at gay couples. But now, if someone points out a person who's gay, it really irritates me. Ever since my son was young, he never stood up straight in photos. He always twisted his body or tilted his head and made funny faces. He loved being the center of attention. He loved making people laugh. Can you see me? Yes. I really thought he might become someone who performs on stage. But after middle school something changed, he shut himself down. It was a shocking transformation. Was it just puberty? Could that change him so drastically? One day I said let's eat at home. As I was preparing dinner he came and put a letter on the table. He asked my husband and me to read it and said he would be back later. I thought, what's going on? Then I started to read his letter. I remember the first sentence vividly: "I am a gay man". That was the first sentence. His letter described the pain and suffering he went through over the past 7 years. He said how lonely it was being in the closet. How he couldn't share his identity with his own mother and father so he decided to come out. He had already come out to his friends. With their support, he could tell us. He said that in a way, we might also be happy about it. He said he could tell us because he believed that we would still love him no matter what. That's what was written in his letter. When I first came to Canada I dreamed of living as an openly gay man. If I met a good-looking guy we could hold hands in the street. We could kiss and feel 100% safe. Wouldn't that be great? A country where I could feel safe. All I did was study English my first year. Now I'm majoring in graphic design in college. I'm doing well here. Hi, mom! - Hi! - Hi! - How are you? - Fine. How about you? Great. What time is it there? 11:30 am. It's 12:30 at night here. Oh, you must be so tired! I haven't seen you in so long. I miss you so much. I know. You should come see me. I just want to touch your face. Well, here I am. On October 13th, 2017 Hankyeol had top surgery to remove their breasts Does it feel good after your surgery? It does. - Even though it hurt? - Yes. I had this really strange feeling looking at my new flat chest. I realized my belly sticks out more now. You better be careful not to move in your sleep. Yeah, I'm worried about that. - If I do, the fluid might build up. - Right. October, 2017 42nd Gathering of PFLAG Korea Hello, my name is Ji-in, I have a 21-year-old son who is gay. It's been over four years since I found out he is gay. I've been coming to PFLAG meetings for about three-and-a-half years. Hello, my name is Vivian. I'm the mother of a 22-year-old gay son. Oh, did I say that too proudly? My child is transgender. They are an... F... Wait, what was it? "MTF transgender". She is living as a woman now. Nice to meet you. Hello, I am Nabi. My child... My only child, that is... is bigender, panromantic and asexual. Now, I don't know exactly what all that means, but that's that. Now let me introduce my queer child, the one who keeps me up at night. I'll skip my intro since my mom did it for me. I'm currently transitioning from female to male. Yesterday, my child who is... trans... gender, or FTM had top surgery, a decision that took a long time. We really thought a lot about this. The words they said right after surgery were, "Thanks, mom". We don't usually say that kind of stuff. If one of us says "I love you" or "Thank you". The other one asks, "What's wrong with you?" Yesterday they cried and said, "Thanks, mom". I said, "No, thank you". "I appreciate what you've endured and how you made your decision". Honestly, the hysterectomy next year will probably be more of an ordeal. I'm glad I came to this gathering to hear your support. Thank you all for being with us throughout this process. It makes me feel like we're not alone in this world. I appreciate the other parents for being with us. At first I went to meetings because Hankyeol asked me to. But at those meetings I started to feel empowered. Every parent comes for their own child. But they really care about every child. It's a pleasure to meet people devoted to sharing their beliefs and values. Toronto, Canada Mom! It's good to see you. - You too. - Welcome. You didn't have to come get me. But you came all the way here. - How are you, son? - Great, you mom? They asked me why I came here and I said, "To see my son!" - Who did? - Immigration. Oh, right. He asked why my stay was so short, I said I'm a busy lady! I prepared my pride outfit for today. It's all pride and rainbows! - Did you bring this with you? - Yeah, I did. I've been waiting for this day. That's too tight, a little looser. It's too short to tie in a ribbon. You're good at this. Better at tying ribbons than me. Good, that's it. It's still too tight. Wow, how amazing! Wow, hello! It won't fit if you write too big. You ran out of space. Make it bold like I did. Exactly. I finally understand why queer people want to experience pride day. I felt it firsthand. Even though I'm just here as a parent, I got a taste of how amazing it can feel. It must mean so much more for queer people themselves. It is Yejoon's choice to stay here or come back to Korea. But I prefer he lives in Canada. The reality of Korea is he still can't live freely and openly. So he has to live as a stranger in a foreign land. I'm just grateful he's adjusting so well. I've been on testosterone for about two years now. There are changes like my voice getting lower. And my body shape is changing slowly too. These are changes you'd expect when going on hormones, but I don't really want some of those changes. I get depressed without the testosterone shots. I take them for my health. When you apply to change your legal gender status, you have to prepare 18 different documents. One is a description of your childhood background. When I heard they require that it felt all-too-familiar. What that means is they won't believe that I'm a man just because I say so. They need me to explain how I got this way. There is an unwritten rule throughout this application process. You're expected to say, "I have a girlfriend, I will marry her,". "I feel the same as any other man". "I've always desired to have male characteristics and be masculine". "I did everything I could to be that way." It's cruel I have to prove that to them. I was born August 29, 1994 in Gunsan, Jeolla Province. I was assigned female at birth. This was based on my genitalia. So I was required by law to live as a woman. But I felt that my gender was male. In elementary school, I wore my hair the way my parents told me to but wore hats because I hated long hair. I avoided wearing skirts. When my family made me wear a skirt, I was depressed the whole day. Even in middle and high school, I chose to wear pants instead and tried my best not to look like a girl. I even asked my school if I could wear the boys' uniform instead. When they said it wasn't allowed I felt like my hopes had been crushed. Worst of all is the "Parental Agreement" legally required to change your gender status. You need your parents' written consent, no matter how old you are. Most transgender people don't see their parents anymore. It's a ridiculous demand. "Parental Agreement". Dear Honorable Judge, I am the mother of Hankyeol, the plaintiff of this case. When they were young and had to change clothes they didn't want to see their female body. So they would turn off the lights to change clothes. They never told me this. I feel sorry they had to bear these worries on their own. Even though I didn't know it then, they had self-harmed and decided to kill themself many times. Last year, they decided to have surgery to remove their breasts and reproductive organs. After the operation with tears in their eyes, they said, "Thanks, mom." After these dangerous operations they finally could appreciate having the body they always believed to be their own. After I thought, "Would it be important to live as a legal male in society?" Does it have to be official? But I realized that in our society if your physical appearance is different from your legal status there are many risks and difficulties. Dear Judge, while my tears as a mother are not enough. After having a child who is a sexual minority I decided never to cry in front of them again. For me, it was a single, life-changing day that I discovered my child was a sexual minority but my child had lived with that burden for over 20 years suffering and enduring it all by themself. They couldn't even tell their friends, at an age where friends are so important. While others thought about the future and career choices, my child thought it was better to die than go on living in this society. "Die today? Or die tomorrow?" That's what my child was thinking. My own tears are merely selfish. Selfish tears of a poor, helpless mother. On October 18th, 2018 Nabi and Hankyeol submitted the 18 documents required for a legal gender status change, including: Parental Agreement, Description of Upbringing Environment, Medical Certificate of Transsexualism, Medical Certificate of Chest Masculinization, Medical Certificate of Hysterectomy and Oopherectomy, Family Relation Certificate, Marriage Certificate (or proof of single status), Immigration Certificate, Credit Inquiry, and Written Statement from Peers and Acquaintances. Toronto, Canada It's tough living abroad I'm getting used to it, but I have no friends or family here. School life is just as difficult. The language is a problem. It's different from life in Korea. Sometimes with my other classmates we talk casually with one another but it's more like a work relationship. The relationships I'm used to in Asian culture even though they weren't ideal are just what I'm used to. I learned that here. It's funny, but I'm waiting for the day I can return to Korea. The media shows western countries as being better for LGBTQIA+ people. But that doesn't mean I'll be accepted as a member of that society just by going there. That's what I've realized. The reason many people return is because culture here is so different from what they grew up with. That kind of foreignness? I think that also exists. Living in Canada for two years I'm slowly realizing I don't want to settle here. First, there are no good guys here. My boy is back in Korea. - Can you see me? - Yejoon! - Yeah, I see you now. - Great. I have good news and bad news. How about the bad news first? Actually, it's not that bad. Then I'll tell you the good news first. Then why ask me? I got a boyfriend. I knew my mom sense was tingling. The bad news is... I'm returning to Korea to live with him for a while. - Oh really? - Yeah. How can you live together in Korea? He lives alone in Jeonju. - All the way over there? - Yeah. He goes to school there. How did you meet? The last time I went to Korea, we met at a gathering and we fell instantly in love. I always knew this day would come. The day he would bring home a boyfriend. It might be awkward for me. I always wondered how I would deal with it. I mean, they might want to... hug each other or something and I'll need to show them it's perfectly natural. Not just act that way, but really feel it. "It's natural!" Almost like I'm educating myself. I train myself mentally. I should do it more now that it's more than just training and has become a reality. I have to work hard to act completely natural in front of them. They are grownups whether they are gay or straight. If a grownup likes someone they should be with them. I'll try to be a really cool mom. Right, I'm going to be a cool mom. Last time I visited Korea, I met my boyfriend by chance. He was a friend of a friend. We fell in love. He's the reason I'm coming back early. No way. How cute. Hi! One, two... Hey, excuse me! Change poses when I tell you to. Okay. Look again at the camera. One, two... I'll walk everywhere proudly Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! - Welcome back. - Hello. Hey, Yejoon. Oh, Sungjun is here too. It's like we're visiting your home. Come on in. - How was it? - Did you take your photos? They were so pretty. Why did you sigh just now? What happened? No, it went well. Oh, you look just like anime characters. It's heavily photoshopped. Yeah, maybe too much, it barely looks like you. Just like an anime. Right? The background is all white. Do you have to wear socks like that? What's this? Since my job requires me to communicate with others I'm okay with talking to strangers. Still, he is my son's boyfriend. It's my first time meeting his partner. I was a bit nervous about it. Let's frame them and put them up. Did you take photos like this with dad? Of course we did, but that was long ago. - You took lovey-dovey photos like this? - No, not like this. Not everyone can do this level of cheesiness. Look how he's trying to get closer. - That's just like us! - He's so in my face. They're exactly like ours. It's totally us. Look at all these old photos. You're so beautiful. - Should we walk on the train tracks too? - Look at the two of us. It must be in our genes. Not a single normal photo. Look how handsome your dad was. He looked just like a Hong Kong actor. That's right, back in the day, in Hong Kong... You were never in Hong Kong. You were such a cutie. Sungjun said I still look the same. When Yejoon showed us the photos they took wearing hanbok. It felt a bit uncomfortable seeing them kissing. But I tried not to let it show. Yejoon was so proud of it. He enjoys moments like that. He's a bit of an attention hog. It was uncomfortable at first, but I quickly got used to it. I'm totally fine now. Court Appearance for Child's Legal Gender Change I'll be leaving around noon and will be back by 4 pm. Yes, ma'am. My hair looks good, doesn't it? You cleaned up for your court date. Right. It was getting a bit scruffy. They don't give you much time. Worst case scenario is they just glance at the documents. Yeah. And they just ask a few questions I don't think they'll ask anything in detail. - Still, we'd better be prepared. - Right. Tell them I tried since I was young. - Tried what? - Tried to grow my hair. You made me and in middle school I cut it short. You tried, but couldn't. I just couldn't do it. And you were depressed and dingy. Also I liked girls back then too. Do I have to say that? I hate playing into their heteronormativity. Yes, you became interested in girls. Can I say I thought you were a lesbian? - No, let's take that out. - Why? I'm worried they might say I should just live as a lesbian. It's better not to mention another option. Who are they to tell you to live as a lesbian or not? You should tell them that. These bastards hold my life in their hands. This is about your legal gender, not about living as a lesbian. The word lesbian could affect their decision on my legal gender. - I'll give them a piece of my mind. - No, it's my life, mom. - We'll show them! - It's my life! They might reject us anyway. I might as well curse at them. Just plead with them. Stop thinking of getting angry. Plead with them? I'm not that kind of person. "You bastards better change it!" I can't say that. So I'll just say, "Please, Your Honor". Court of Korea Seoul Family Court Spread your arms. You're good. This way, please. Yes, ma'am. Let's do this! I'm going home now. Okay. Get some rest. - Hankyeol Lee? - Yes, that is me. - You are the mother? - Yes, Your Honor. What do you do for a living? I work part-time as a videographer but because my legal ID says I'm female I can't find regular work. So I've just been working case by case instead of finding permanent employment. They are totally capable of finding a full-time job. Having to live like this is hard on my child and it's hard for me to watch too. There is one thing that we have to consider whether or not you've had sex reassignment surgery. You removed your female reproductive organs and had various other operations. However... physically-speaking, you still haven't had genital reconstructive surgery. No, I haven't. That was a requirement in the list of documents. To change your sex legally you need male genitals similar to that of a biological male. They need to at least be similar in appearance. The reason the Supreme Court made this decision and why applications are denied based on that is that we have determined these conditions to be necessary to form and live as a community. The court decided not to permit Hankyeol's legal gender status change because they did not undergo genital reconstructive surgery. I didn't get anything in print regarding my gender status change application but you can check the verdict online. It's simple. April 11, 2019. "Case Dismissed". I was mainly worried about two things while preparing for my legal gender status change. The first was the reconstruction of a penis, which is something I don't want as of now and even if I did I couldn't afford it. That was the first, and the second was my biological father. I didn't want to get his written consent. Even before I went to court, I didn't want to ask him. This person... Even if he is technically my parent. That man is not my father. When I heard I had to additionally submit my father's written consent I asked my mom for help but felt sorry at the same time. I've had to force her again and again to stay in touch with her ex-husband for the sake of my trans identity. No issues with the evacuation route. Obstacle-free. If I say I can't get my father's consent because my parents are divorced they might say I'm confused about my gender due to the absence of a father figure. Or some other bullshit like I'm confused because my mom has to fill my dad's shoes. It's infuriating that these judges get to decide arbitrarily what happens to trans people's lives. One person can decide your life. If you're lucky you meet a good judge and can legally change your gender. Or else your case is just dismissed after months of preparation. All of this... makes me feel I'm living my life as someone who is not quite human. I feel like I am just a ghost. Really... I don't want this to go on for too long. Go home! Go home! First Queer Culture Festival in Incheon City This is wrong! This is wrong! All you gays should leave! Police, they're trying to kill us! Go home! - Go home. - No, you go. - My son is gay. - Did you come here for fun? - Did Jesus say so? - It isn't funny! No homosexuality! No homosexuality! I came as a representative of any parent who loves their children. I love my children. I am raising my children to be healthy and strong in the Republic of Korea. My children are the future of this fine country, I love the Republic of Korea. I want to raise my beloved children to be healthy in this country. What they are doing is illegal. Homosexuality is illegal. They need to leave! It's hard to understand how much Hankyeol suffers I mean, I'm not them but at the festival, I got punched right in front of everyone. Even with all those police watching. There's hundreds of us, but there's thousands hating us just because we stood with sexual minorities. That's when I realized the kind of world we live in. We are here! Living together beside you! The interesting thing is... Seeing the amount of hatred these people have I might try to stop Hankyeol from coming because it's dangerous but I don't. Instead, I became a fighter for them. Our children live in this crazy world. As parents, we've got to fight for them. That is something hard to explain with simple logic. I love you just as you are This is the end of our wandering Say goodbye to the constant sadness See you next year! After the dismissal of Hankyeol's case, they reapplied at the district court in Nabi's hometown. Should we start from your childhood? Yes, let's try to put them in order. Let's make it look as nice as we can. Yeah, let's try our best. Starting from childhood. This is from 2000, so before 2002. - Just go by what you see. - No, the dates are written on there. Some of the dates aren't right. You're youngest here, so these ones are next. I think we can take this out. My hair is too long here. - You think so? - A bit, yeah. What if they ask why there are no photos with my father? Just say you didn't have one. - But he filled out the documents. - Yeah, but... I'm worried it might not look good. I heard if you have no dad they may think you're trying to fill that role. They might say I'm confused. I heard that happens. Let's just tear them up then. Department of Family Registration and Divorce by Agreement Let's do this! This, then that. You forgot our handshake. - Yeah. - Once more. That's it. - Ever visit the divorce room? - Sure! What a badass. Was it here? No, I don't think so. I don't remember. - Hankyeol Lee? - Yes, sir. - And this is your mother? - Yes. Well, I've taken a look through all the documents in your application. Yes. Are you really sure you won't regret changing your legal gender status? There's no chance you might want to change it back? No, I will not. Right, well I've read all the documents and met you in person. Especially after hearing from your mother. I think there is no doubt about it. So I will permit gender status change. But our society is still not entirely open to sexual minorities. Even though we live in an intolerant society I hope you will not be too hurt by it and will live your life with pride. Thank you so much. Dear Nabi! Our Joan of Arc! November, 2019 65th Gathering of PFLAG Korea Let's begin our 65th gathering with a round of applause. My name is Sori, today's moderator. I am an activist in PFLAG Korea. Hi, I'm the 54-year-old father of a 24-year-old gay son. My name is Jimmy. Hello, my name is Nabi and I am a member of PFLAG. My child is 26 and identifies as bigender, panromantic, and asexual. They have transitioned from female to male and recently finished their legal gender status process. Nice to meet you. Hello, I am the mother of a 39-year-old transgender child. She came out four years ago, which is rather late. I joined this group about three-and-a-half years ago. My name is Jiwol, nice to meet you. You said your legal gender change is now finally finished. Let's give them a round of applause. I heard it was a difficult process. It would be great if you could share your experience. It took exactly one year to complete. We applied on October 18th and it was finally changed this year. Meanwhile, my mom tried to kill me several times saying I don't even earn a decent living. Now our relationship is much better. Going through this made me think of all the parents here. I got so much information from this group and got to hear other people's experiences. If I hadn't joined PFLAG, without your support it would have been too difficult to go through this process alone. I want to express my sincere appreciation to you. Thank you. Our relationship really is getting better. Both of our lives have become more comfortable, more solid. We are bolder now. Most of all, it's great that Hankyeol decided to live their own life fully no matter what that life may be. I'm so relieved for that. Look at Hankyeol over there. Your older brother's having a blast. We went through this difficulty together, as mother and child. It's such a relief. Starting from August, 2019 after a revision to the "Administrative Guide. Principles Concerning the Sex Change of Transsexuals", it is now possible to apply for a legal gender status change without requiring the applicant's parental consent. Some courts, however, still request this document out of convention. Hello? Coming. - Welcome. - Hello. You look so beautiful today. - It's so good to see you. - She did her makeup. - You're tired, aren't you? - I'm fine, thanks. I brought you this for Valentine's Day. - Oh, is it Valentine's Day? - It's tomorrow. Thanks, I totally forgot. Did you buy this for me? - Yes. - My goodness! So what was your mom's first reaction? Oh, on New Year's Day she saw my ring and asked, "Are you dating someone?" I told her I bought it for myself. From some shop on the street corner. Later I thought it might be a good opportunity to come out. I said, "Mom, you asked about my ring". "It's actually a couples ring." "But it's from a boy, not a girl." - She was shocked. - Of course. It can get emotional as you talk about this stuff. My mom was in a state of shock but I was determined to tell her. If she couldn't accept it I wouldn't visit her often in Busan anyway. - What else could I say. - Just consider it as losing a son! It made me wonder when Yejoon came out about how you felt. But mom, about 2 weeks afterwards you were like... I brought her to PFLAG one month after coming out. But for that first month... She said she was fine. That was after one week... One week after coming out. It took four days, not a week. I was in New York and cried. I cried for two days straight. She cried again over dinner. Then suddenly said, "Okay, I'm fine now". Right. She said she felt so fine she didn't need to go to PFLAG. So I thought, "Okay, she's really freaking out now". "She's so confused she lost her way." "She's lying to herself." I wasn't confused, more like avoiding it. Right. So after a month, I brought her to another parents meeting. It was her day to say hello. I entered with a big smile. She went in looking fine. Then it was her turn to say, "I'm the mother of a gay son". When it was her turn she couldn't even say it and burst into tears. She couldn't even say the word gay. She just started sobbing. The other parents cried too. Everyone cried. There were a lot of new members. - Right. - All the new members cried passing around tissues. Let's do the meat first. I'll do the garlic. Right, garlic first. Wait, Honey. Do the meat first. I really enjoy living with my husband. We've been married for 24 years. Sometimes he is my best friend, other times my lover. Does this look okay? It looks fine. I chopped as much as I could. Getting married isn't important. I hope Yejoon is with someone he can share his feelings with and rely on. A person he can spend time and share his true feelings with. It doesn't matter if he's married or not I hope he isn't lonely. That's so funny. - You look good. - We both look great. - Did you start? - Yes. You have to ask me first. Where are we now? We are at the Gimhae Airport. I'm on my way to meet his mother. I'm so nervous. - You wore a new outfit today. - Right. This is great. - Shall we go? - Yes. - Welcome. - Hello. - What is that you have there? - I brought you some flowers. Are they for me? - I didn't get anything. - Oh, that's fine. How is your work going? It would be odd if it was going well. It can't go well during the pandemic. We came to cheer you up. On Sundays, when I didn't work, I would take Sungjun to places like the Children's Grand Park. We went all the time, didn't we, Sungjun? Yes. I was so happy then. I had no idea he was gay. He was such a soft boy... Then he... went to middle and high school and was a top student. It felt like I grew wings. A pair of invisible wings. What was this feeling? I could even die for him. I heard he was a good student. When he and his father slept, I woke up at dawn for work. In order to pay for his education. I wanted to do everything I could for him. Even though we were in a tight spot. That's what I did. Then what? Then I regretted everything. When he came out and revealed his identity I realized I didn't have to work that hard. Why did I go to two schools and get all these certificates? It was all for Sungjun. I only cared about him. If Sungjun brought home a girlfriend I wanted to be a good enough mother so she'd want to marry him. That's why I studied so hard and got these licenses. I still expected him to come back someday. - Every parent does. - He has to come back - I'm still waiting for him. - Usually, for about a year... I don't care what you do. Just come back. I know he will. You two have to try hard. - Until the very end. - The end? Until the day you die. That's the only way people will recognize you as living together as a couple. Right, but mom. I'm not sure, but I just feel... like I've hurt you so much. You say we have to live well. But rather than living to be recognized by society. We both have great families. We just want to make sure we keep that bond and live happily together. National Human Rights Commission Thank you for coming here today, on November 13, for this historical event. Let's start this press conference for same-sex marriage rights. Please hold up your signs. We came out to our families and have lived together for a long time. Naturally, both of our families already accept us as partners. But it is a sorrow that our relationship means nothing in the eyes of the law. She will help me when I'm sick, but has no legal rights as my partner. Without the good graces of our families we cannot make any decision for ourselves. This is the most unbearable part of all. Why can't we make the same decisions heterosexual couples can? When we are young and healthy, we are fine just being together. But if we ever get sick or die our relationship exists outside of the law. The assets we've built over the years are not protected by the law. I hope we are granted the same rights as others. Hello, I am Vivian and I am here to represent PFLAG Korea. This is my first time at a press conference. Hearing the words said here today I know that our country is wrong. Now I will read my statement. My name is Vivian and I have a 24-year-old son who is gay. After seven difficult years of self-denial my son came out to me when he was 21. I was completely shocked at first. Then I was saddened that he would live a lonely and sad life, unable to get married. I even said it was my fault he was born to live this sad life as an attempt to comfort him. Later as I became a parent activist I took a look back at why I reacted so strongly. The fact that my son would not be recognized by this society was absolutely shocking to me. Most parents pass away before their children. When I think of my gay son not having anyone to care for him, to take him to the hospital when he gets sick, I am choked by tears. If our society recognizes same-sex marriage more people hiding in fear will be able to come out as themselves. My son's dream to live with his partner and be accepted is something I dream of every day. Thank you. A transgender student admitted to a women's university dropped out stating she felt terrified by the opposition to her entrance. Today a 22-year-old admitted to a women's university became the talk of the town. She was a trans woman who had legally changed her gender last year but she dropped out from enrolling. She said in a statement her reason was that her daily life was completely ruined by controversy. She also said she feared for her life. What if other students didn't want to live in the dorms with them? I think that could be an issue. The radical feminist club fiercely opposed her admission. She said she would reapply to different schools and hopes society will one day embrace diversity. Hankyeol said they were disturbed by the issue at the university. After reading the comments online they were sad and depressed. Once they visited a psychiatrist to get suicide-prevention pills. Before this case, they took it once every one or two months. But just in the last week they took it four times already. I felt so depressed after hearing this and became more worried than ever. Then I read this article online. A Swiss man in his 40s wanted to die a death of dignity. It was permitted, so he took a photo smiling with his family. Then he died by injection. After reading that I thought if my child feels their life is so unbearable and it becomes too hard they might make an extreme decision. Then what if they die all alone by jumping or hanging or taking pills. I thought they might die a lonely, painful death. So if it ever becomes too difficult I'd like to say to them, though I'm not sure I could actually say this... If you really want to die let's go to Switzerland, I will protect you up until the moment you die so you aren't lonely and there is no pain. I will be with you in that last moment. I want to say these words. Life is supposed to be hard, but also happy and fulfilling. If your life is too hard and you feel the ground under you crumble away I cannot force you to go on. So if you ever make the decision to die I just don't want you to die alone. In your last moment I want to be with you. At least that way you will have someone with you. I'll be there so you don't feel loneliness or pain. Truly. I just don't want you to be alone. I thought this after reading that article. For me, it's important that they are alive. That's important for me, but... Welcome home. Look at her wag her tail. It looks like you're wearing a purple hat. - Could be. - Good to see you. Eat it. Good, huh? You only eat it after I do, you rascal. - You're her taste tester. - Right, her royal taste tester. Ow, my lip. I've got some ointment. - Huh? - It's for cold sores. - Cold sores? - Yeah, blisters. It's to treat viruses and stuff. Ointment treatment for cold sores and blisters. Why don't you try it? - How about it? - Alright. Let me see. It doesn't just treat sores, but gets the virus. This isn't from chapped lips. It's a virus. Oh, it hurts! Must be an infection. - It hurts? - Yeah. You seasoned it perfectly. I'm glad. It's hot, let it cool. July, 2020 68th Gathering of PFLAG Korea - Yejoon! - How have you been? It's so nice to meet you. I've only seen you in photos. Sungjun looks just like you. You think? - Yes, he takes after his mother. - He looks just like you. - What about us? - You too. - Thank you so much for coming. - It is my pleasure. I am also from Busan, did they tell you? I'm a Busan gal, through and through. Hello, I am his father. Hello everyone, my nickname is Il-wol. I work at PFLAG Korea as the general manager. I am a lesbian and will be today's moderator. I'm Insun Kwak. Oh dear... It's been five months since I found out my son is gay. I came as a representative of all our family members in Busan. I felt like I had to attend this meeting. I want to hear the other parents' feeling and to meet them in person. My son spent seven years in self-denial and self-loathing. I found out much later. When he first came out to me to be honest, I couldn't understand because I never knew before. But when I thought about how much he suffered I realized my needs weren't the priority. I decided to at least pretend to be supportive. It took me two years to understand and really accept him. I live in Busan while my son goes to school in Jeonju. When he first left for school I started imagining the day he would get married, preparing for the day he would leave my nest. But now it is clear I mean, literally he said I should have no expectations for marriage. Maybe he was finally fine with coming out to me. But for me as the listener I wasn't ready at all. I was speechless. If this is the price I must pay for giving birth to him... If you are gay then I must accept it. So I accepted it. I thought I did, but it wasn't true acceptance. This was something I could never even imagine. Hearing those words from my son's mouth. My husband is a bit frail so I can't say this to him. Not yet. I know I need to, but when? I wanted to hear your advice. At first I was afraid to come, but my son wanted me to so I came, worried I'd get hurt again. After coming back for a year, then two years I've heard so many stories from the other parents and the experiences of their children. It has been so helpful for me. I am grateful my son's boyfriend and his mother could join us. Now that I can talk openly with Sungjun I feel like I can reconnect with him. So, I will go back and tell his father later today that I participated in this meeting. I'm not sure I'll be back next month but will try like the other mothers here. Nothing can stop me! The most important thing now is how I live with Sungjun. I really want to give it my best shot. So what's first, making a donation? End! Discrimination! Stop! Hatred! Go PFLAG Korea! Hello and welcome! You are welcome here. After Yejoon came out I began my fight for human rights. I met so many different people. Seeing all the young activists. Working with them at the same, equal level. In Korea usually there's a hierarchy between parents and their children. But I think that kind of relationship is wrong. We should be on equal footing. People tend to believe family is the root of everything. But I think that may be some kind of fantasy. I make my own roots. I do. Sometimes we get nutrients from outside. But we can withstand storms on our own. Nutrients are just nutrients. Even without them, if you face a storm it may be harder but you'll grow stronger. When I see people with a supportive family it's great, good for them. But when I see those without that it is even better. They will be much stronger. That's what I think. The right to happiness for LGBTQIA+ is the same as your right to happiness. We are members of PFLAG Korea! I am proud of my children! PFLAG Korea started as a self-help group in 2014. In 2018, it was reformed into a human rights advocacy group for LGBTAIQ+ and their families. The parents of PFLAG Korea at this very moment continue their efforts to come out to the world.
