What's your opinion of Terminal Island? It makes me feel safe. We don't have the death penalty to protect us anymore. It's where we dump our garbage. Well I think the death penalty is the real answer to the whole thing. Why should I pay taxes to support a bunch of killers? Well, it wouldn't be no money to put a rope around their neck. Well they need to be somewhere. I think it's a good idea. Let 'em kill each other off. Why should it concern American citizens if they're on an island to themselves? Sounds like a pretty good idea to me. I mean let 'em fight among their selves if that's what they wanna do. It sounds absurd. Maybe they can get together and make a better life for themselves, or maybe it'll work the other way. That's kind of a leper colony. And what's your opinion of Terminal Island? What's Terminal Island? That's all? It's enough. How's it coming? Well, we just looked at "The Man in the Street" footage. It'll work. Okay, Craig, let's see that feature we ran last fall. Maybe we can steal something from it. It's too soon to run it again. The viewers are gonna remember. Com on, those dummies can't remember what they saw five minutes ago. Three years ago, the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. 18 months later, the people of the state of California voted two to one in favor of the San Bruno Initiative. Opponents said it was worse than the death penalty while advocates maintained it was the cheapest way to support criminals sentenced to life imprisonment. 40 miles off our coast lies the final solution, the San Bruno Maximum Security Detention Center, better known as Terminal Island. The inmates of this bleak island prison are all convicted of the same crime, murder in the first degree. The arrival of a new inmate, the delivery of the bare necessities for survival, these are Terminal Island's only contact with the outside world. There are no walls here, no guards, no rules, but escape is impossible. The picket ship Norma maintains continual vigilance over the only safe small boat channel. The rest of the island is surrounded by electronically controlled mines. Since this film was released, No newsmen or cameras have been allowed anywhere near Terminal Island. Still up to date. Next I thought we could flash some of the most famous faces on the screen and show a brief rehash of their crimes. Recognize anyone? Not yet. Bobby Far, we can use him. Oh what a punk. Who did he kill? His partner in a two million dollar robbery. Bobby didn't want to share. Hey, I know her, Lee Phillips. She threatened the Antitrust Bank, either they pulled all their money out of south America or she was gonna blow up a branch a week. Did she do it? Yeah, in San Francisco, she blew up a bank building. And a bank teller and a bank guard. Hey, it was an accident. She only wanted to destroy property. Well in that case she deserves a reprieve. She's a very bright chick. She almost got her PhD. Come on, come on. Oh, A.). Thomas, now he Killed the cop. What's so special about that? You're right. Oh, Bunny Campbell, did in her mommy and daddy with an ice pick. Her we can use. Ooh, Julian Mother Dylan, remember him? Oh, doper, biker, killer, rapist, a man they'll love to hate. Joy Lange. All she did was poison her husband. Sex, got to keep 'em interested till the commercial. Then how about something for the bored housewife? Dr. Norman Milford, the Mercy Killer. We don't have a maniac. We got to have a maniac. Here he is, Roy Teal, left 11 dead in six states. Sounds good. Then we'll end the show with footage of our star. Have you seen who we got in today? Miss Simms, how do you feel about being sent to Terminal Island? Miss Sims? - Over here. Miss Sims? Miss Sims, Miss Sims, what are your comments on Judge Clay, Miss Sims? How do you feel about being sent to Terminal Island, Miss Sims? - Over here! - Miss Sims? Over here! Okay, let me see, over this we'll tell 'em how Carmen Simms final appeal has been denied and she'll be transferred to Terminal Island immediately. We'll say how Terminal Island was headline news nine months ago when the first inmates went there. Today it's forgotten, but Carmen Simms forces us to remember. Soon it will be forgotten again, et cetera, et cetera.

Go ahead. You'd be doing me a favor. It's wild mimosa. You want a snort? I don't want to get stoned. You will. What's your name? Carmen. Mine's Milford. I used to be a doctor. Got anything that hurts? Nothing that you can help. Where is everybody? I haven't seen no one. They've seen you. Yeah, where are they? Not far, over that bluff. How many are there? Now, maybe 40. When I first came here, almost 75. How many women? Not enough. I saw two bodies in the water. How'd they get there? Well, were they killed? I don't know, maybe. Everybody on this island's a killer except me.> I'm innocent. Yeah. Aren't we all? Thank you, doctor. That's enough. Good workout, Monk. It's fine. Just fine. New bitch oughta be here any minute, huh Bobby? Yeah. Break her in. Hi brother, I'm Carmen. Yeah, you look like you could take on about three or four right off. Get your hands off of me. I don't know what you thought before you got to this island but I'm gonna tell you what to think now. If I tell you to kiss my ass, I want you on your knees before I finish talking. I don't get on my knees for nobody. Oh you son of a bitch! No! Stop it, let go of me! Let go of me! Help me somebody! Help me, please help me! Nobody's gonna help you. You move, ['ll break your neck. You let go of me. I'll kill you. You let go of me. Welcome to Terminal Island, baby. Looks like we got ourselves some nice little equipment here, Bobby. Nobody's done any work here today. Yeah, but they ain't had no ass all week. They'll get it when I say they've earned it. Now put them to work right now. Okay, Conrad, Red, Vander, Dutch- Nobody helped me. Let go! I'll bust your head open. Bunny, let go. What was that all about? You were lying in her corner. Okay, I'll take this corner if nobody objects. I wouldn't do that. Why not? That's her corner too. All right, have it your way. I'm not hassling over nothing with some spaced out freak. I don't like these accommodations anyway. What kind of bastards have you got here anyway? What do you want? We got white bastards, black bastards, big bastards. Why are we penned in here like pigs? Because we're too valuable to run loose. Valuable? We're the property of every man on this island. You have to screw every man here? You will too. You're gonna lighten our workload, baby. Who runs this show? Bobby and Monk. Well, nobody's gonna run me. I'm breaking out of here. I'm going after Monk. I'm gonna wipe out that big nigger faggot. I'm gonna smash his balls till they turn to jello. Take that finger out of my face or I'll break it off. And for an opener, things are gonna change around here. One more squawk outta you, miss freak, and I'll do to you what I did to my last cell mate when she leaned on me. I killed her. IIs that a fact? Okay cows, you can rest. Has anybody ever tried to stand up to them? Sure, they're either dead or gone. Gone where? Some guys escaped. They're hiding out somewhere if they're still alive. Maybe I'll join them. What makes you think they're any better than these cruds around here? I could use some of that too. This ain't no coffee break. Where you going, Chino? You all right? He's talking to you. I'm gonna cut your liver out, man. You think so, huh? Chino, look out. All right, all right, cut the crap. Monk's right, we can't have any violence around here. He was coming on with her and slowing up the work. Oh, you're attracted to each other? How sweet. Go on, Chino, do anything you want to her, we'll all watch. Field work just doesn't seem to agree with these ladies. Their minds wander. Starting this afternoon, you'll help build a storehouse. Maybe that'll hold your attention. You're in bad shape. Hey doctor! What is it? Strain yourself, come on over here and see! Look at her hands. I'll have to bandage them. You could have warned me, man. You could have told me what it was like and I wouldn't have come here, I'd have hid out. Look, out there alone, you'd die. At least here, you'll live. Bitch, move your ass or else you're dead. Now! Don't get too cozy, everybody's working a night shift tonight. You don't need a shirt for what you're gonna do. Joy, you got Fuller, Hagan, Kowalski and Vander. Lee, you got Warner, Burns, Red and Killerman. And you, you get Herst, Dutch, Gross, Jones and Konrad. Don't we ever get to sleep? All you gotta do is lie back and take it. Nobody says you got to stay awake. Why doesn't she go? She does. She goes to Bobby. Monk? Yeah, Bobby? Monk, get that thing on. Hurry up. I mean it hurry it up. Mmhmm. That little freak bitch is outside. Send her in and watch that light. Turn around, Bunny. How are you Bunny? What's new? Take off your shirt, Bunny. Of course if you don't want to, just say no. Then take it off, Bunny. And now the rest. You seem to be at a loss for words, Bunny. Come here and sit down. If there's anything that you don't want to do, just say the word. Okay Bunny, you can eat now. I've got tits, so I have to play Betty Crocker. I wish I could poison them all with something that works real slow. I think I've changed my mind. I'm not very hungry. You're too pretty to kill, Chino. We'll keep you around. Hey that angle is too steep, it'll overflow. What's that all about? Bobby wants running water in the storeroom. Personally, I don't think it's gonna work. No, raise that other end. Let it happen, Monk. That crazy son of a bitch. He ought to be done away with right now. No, it's just one less mouth to feed. Anybody like to say a few words? Yeah, good riddance. Wash faster. Why? We got to get back. There's guys out there who'd love to get a hold of you. Bobby kicked them out of camp before you came here and we got orders to kill them on site. Did you ever hear Bunny talk? No, she stopped when she killed her folks. I wonder why. She never told us. I thought you guys were dead. We will be if we don't get out of here. Let's go. It's okay, come on. We got 'em. We sure as hell did. Bobby's gonna shit. Bobby's gonna shit when he finds out we stole his women. The night feels real fine. I've been saving this for the right time and tonight is the right time for sure. Here. No, I don't want to be loaded if Bobby and Monk show up. They won't. Little rat won't do nothing unless the sun's out. Bobby's afraid of the dark? Bet your sweet ass he is. Well in that case. Hey, this is mead. It's what? Mead, fermented honey and water. Well now ain't that something. Back home, we just call it CP. CP? Cow piss. Three months out here and even you look good, Joy. I see your brain is still between your legs, Dylan. Hey Aiken, what do you got against them birds? You're cooking them to death. Don't eat 'em. Send some of that over here. Why you hanging back? I like to test the water before I jump in. You got to try this part, Joy. Here. Ooh, what's so great about that part? Just taste it. Well? Well, it's good, it's just fine. You know what they say? The closer to the bone, the sweeter the meat. Oh, I dropped some down my shirt. Oh, here's some. And here's some more. And here's some more. There's no more. Here, you can have some of mine. Oh, I'm all done. Ah, here's some. And here's some more. I don't think there's any meat down there, Joy. Oh I know, but there's a bone. Okay, I'm ready. You split. Now this ain't right, Dylan. You ought to ask her if she wants to first. I've been flogging my mule for three months the same as you, partner. I ain't asking nothing. Look, why don't you just let her be? Oh God, you stink of garbage. Get off of me! Stick that back in your pants, Dylan. Get off of me. I hate you. Stop it, I hate you! Get off, off! Get off of me! On, I hate you, oh. Now that would be a hell of a mistake. You're gonna wish you hadn't done that, Dylan. I'm gonna fix your ass. Where are we gonna meet? How 'bout the stream on the way to the soft camp? What about them? Yeah, what about us? Just gonna let 'em run around loose? No. Nobody's gonna put me in no cage. And anybody who thinks different is gonna eat a piece of this. I just said you ain't gonna run around loose. Now staying alive out here is a bitch, baby. So you're gonna carry your weight just like everybody else. That's cool. How are we gonna handle it? They don't even know their way around the island. Well, we have to split up. Some of you will come with us. Let's go. Is this the way you've been living, wake up and run? You keep moving, you're harder to hit. Or what do you want to do, sit around here and wait for Bobby? No, I want to go find him and kill him. Why don't you try counting how many of them there are, then how many of us? I have, but they say that when you cut off the head of the snake, the body dies too. I just hope you don't get bit. I won't. It's time to move. Your turn. In a minute. You know what this is? Let me think, a rock. It's niter. We can get potassium nitrate from it. Terrific. If we mix it with sulfur and charcoal, we can make gunpowder and some pretty deadly hand grenades. What y'all doing? You ready for World War III? Shoot honey, I'm ready for anything. What's this? Can you eat it? It's moonseed vine, grows all over the place. Ever heard of Curare? You mean that poison stuff they put on darts? Right. All we got to do is boil that down and we've got a mean mother on our side. How do you know about all this? My grandma. She was really into voodoo. You believe in it too? Only when it works. Hey. Yeah? Here's your knife. Keep it. No, I don't want it anymore. You sure wanted it last night. That was last night. Okay, I'll get you one of your own. A.J. Yeah? Why'd you take us away from Bobby? I don't like to fish alone. You can pick some of these, Rabbit. The red ones are ripe. Stay here, be real quiet. I'm gonna get us some dinner. I don't want to wait another week while you play around out there. And I'm telling you I looked under every bush. Not every bush or you would've found them. Soon as I get the chance, I'm gonna brew up some more of that sauce. What's that? That's royal jelly. Those bees'll stomp all over your body if you get any of that on you. There's a whole hive of 'em right there in that stump. How nice. Hi. Hi? I thought you wanted to cut my dong off. Oh that's the last thing I want to do. Haven't you ever said anything you don't mean and then realized how wrong you were? - You mean even after I? - Oh even during. Oh wait, ooh, just a minute. What's that? You want some honey? Some what? Honey. No, I ain't got a sweet tooth. Oh I do. I just love the taste of honey. Take off your pants. Oh hurry. Oh wow. Ooh, hurry. Oh, I'm so hungry. Lie down, lie down. Oh, oh, oh. Oh baby. That's it. More to the left, huh? Yeah. Now shut your eyes and turn over. What? Just do it. The best part's coming up. Hurry baby. Hurry, come on, hurry. Here's your pants, lover. Now we're even. Get me some time. You got it. Hey brother. You looking for something? Come on, they're getting away over there. They're on their way. That's one for A.J. I can see you found something. Vander killed Larry. Teal got Aiken. Kiki got away but he's bleeding real bad. He ain't gonna make it. But what about the others? I want them dead, Monk. Why can't you do that? How is he? Worse. If we don't stop the bleeding, he's gonna die. We can't do anything. Milford can. Is it ready? Yeah. Don't do it. We need you. Look, I can't just sit here and watch him bleed to death. You want company? No. Go on, take a break. It's my turn. I can do that. What the crud? It's that shit he shorts. You're through with this. Try and get him straight. Where's Carmen? And Cornell? Where are they? Kiki's dead. We can take them. I keep thinking about numbers. There's only seven of us. Yeah, but we can make grenades and that evens it. Oh, you think so? Ain't none of us ever getting off this island anyway. So far we've been running. They won't to expect us to be hidden. Cornell's right. Don't you think I'd like to go in there and bust that little bastard's head wide open? I'm the only one that stood up to him and I almost lost my ass doing it. The rest of you came with me, remember that? We got memories, man, but that was then and this is now. Okay Cornell. The worst that can gonna happen to us is that we die. Here it is, witches' brew. How strong is this stuff? With one of these in you, you'd be dead in about 10 seconds. This thing won't backfire, will it? Well just be sure you blow instead of suck. Does that make it? Perfect. I've got plenty of niter and charcoal's no problem. What I need now is sulfur. Then we can grind the mixture with this rock. Where are we gonna find sulfur? I don't know. My chemicals always came in bottles. Wild mustard has a high sulfur content. That stuff grows every place. Good. We're ready. We don't have any room for junkies. If you stick with us, you stay straight. Amen. You expect to get music out of that thing? Did you soak the thread in salt water? What do you think? No, something's wrong. I can't hear anything. Relax, you just have to wet the coil. The only problem now is tuning it to the correct wavelength. You can handle that. What are you gonna do with this? Listen to the news, Monk. Press harder, the mixture has to be ground under pressure. That's good. That's supposed to be a frag grenade? It's half filled with powder and half with rock coral. When you throw it, match with the striker inside and it explodes. That's a great little firecracker. Let me see. This one loaded? Don't screw the cap on until you're ready to use it. Here catch. Duck! I just wanted to see if it was loaded. Dylan, if assholes had wings, you could fly us all out of here. Where's Rabbit? She was over there. She shouldn't be out there alone. She's dead. Hold it, Bobby'll want her. Screw Bobby. Look what she did to my face. It helps. Down here. Come on, let's get her back. You coming? Oh yeah. I'm gonna use you for firewood, Teal. Mad Dog Roy Teal. I'll bet he's lying on his back cold and stiff. He was so stupid. Maybe he'll come back. No way, Monk. His miserable life is over. I know it. What is it? The picket ship, they're bringing in supplies in the morning. It's so perfect. And she'll make it so easy. It's a waste man. She's just not worth it. Nobody's asking you to come. You know what to do. Your plan had better work. It will. What are those bastards doing to her? What's wrong? Nothing but this'll make it much better. I'll get help. Hey man, lay off. I ain't waiting. Don't blow it. No one will be able to resist that. Right on time. Of course. Let's get out of sight. Yeah. I want it to work, Bunny. I had to use you. You understand. What are they pulling? Where the hell is Lee? I can't take it anymore. Cover me. Milford, go find Bunny and don't get spotted, huh? Like clockwork, Bobby. Let's trade. Come on, you'll get it back. I want you to watch the boat. I'll send Monk with some men and they'll bring the supplies back to camp. Okay. They're gonna miss that boat, ain't they? Monk push it out. It hits one of those mines out there, boom. They'll think the pilot made a mistake. Man, you don't miss nothing. Two machine guns. We're screwed. We're going down to that boat. They're holding a piece down there, man. That's why we're going. How did we get close without getting shot? Same as they did. You can swim? Like a water snake. Okay, hold it right there. Partner. I'm a peaceable man. I got no quarrel with you, stranger. I thought I told you to get out of my town. This ain't your town. You calling me a liar? No, I wouldn't call you that. I'd call you Get it? I'm on your side. I don't need you. I don't need anybody but these and a bunker. Found us some gas. I ain't got my bike with me. Bring it. We're going into battle and that burns very hot. What about this? That's too heavy and they may be back any minute now. I can't find Bunny anywhere. She must've went... I want to go home. Did you at least blow up the boat? Yeah, yeah, but we shouldn't have left Red out there alone. They got one gun. What does that mean? For three months, we don't even see 'em and now they're ripping us off one by one. First Dutch, then Red, even Teal. Conrad's all we got left. And we could have used Vander. You're afraid, Monk. Bullshit. You think they're gonna come after us now, don't you? Well, they are. How do you know that? Because they're smart and strong. The only strong ones left besides me and you. She'd have made a fine old lady, don't ya think? You ever been on a bike? You guys are fossils, you know that? There ain't nothing like sitting on a chop down hog all that power between your legs, vroom, vroom. What a scene. For sure. Remember Big Ernie's funeral? 40 bikes right up the church steps. Yeah, when we rode out of that cemetery, I kept wondering how Big Ernie liked that send off? This time tomorrow, you can probably ask him. Are you coming with us tomorrow? I wouldn't miss it for the world. The doomed against the damned. By the way, what are you fighting for? Survival. We're here forever and so are you. Or do you have some kind of dream of going back? Not after what medicine did to me. What was that? I had a patient with permanent brain damage being kept alive by artificial life support. I withdrew it with his wife's permission. In my opinion, he was already dead, but his father didn't agree, had me charged with murder and all my colleagues testified against me. I was convicted on a legal technicality. Are you dead when your brain stops working or when your heart stops beating? No, I wouldn't go home if I could. You are home. He's waiting for us. Bobby? Yeah. How do you know? Take a look at camp. There's no sign of life, is there? Where are they? They're probably hiding behind the tents or maybe they got a plan of their own. So what? It won't change anything. Don't look. You're in luck. That trough that runs down to the bunker is still standing. You think Bobby and Monk are together? No, if I were them, I'd separate and set up a crossfire. Well, wherever they've got the machine guns. Lee, give them a chance to get over by that trough before you make your move, okay? Right. Come on. Let's go. Get this done by lunch. Okay, Bunny, now when we wave this, I want you to open the cans and light this and throw it in the trough, okay? Now don't let us down. Good luck. Who would you leave up here, Milford? You're right. You'll be all right. Let's go. That dude just took his last crap. It's Bobby, he's in the bunker. Cornell, get down! Where's Cornell? He got it. Monk's behind Bobby's old tent, we got to get him. We can't do anything pinned down like this. How many grenades left? Just two. Bobby, hold your fire. It's me, Monk. Open the door. Open the door, Bobby! God damn it, Bobby, open the door. Bobby! Bobby! It's me! Bobby, open the door, it's Monk! Bobby! Bobby, you're wasting ammunition. God damn it, Bobby, you're wasting ammunition. God damn it, Bobby! I knew it. Guess it's my turn. You ain't going! Bobby? Bobby, is that you? Bobby, I can't see. Bobby? Bobby? Bobby, I can't see! I can't see, Bobby! I can't see. I can't see. My eyes, I can't see. Boy, will I be happy four months from now. 'Cause the baby will be here? No because I can stop drinking this lousy goat's milk. Ulgh! Dr. Norman Milford, report to the beach. Dr. Norman Milford, report to the beach. Dr. Norman Milford. Who wants him? Just get him. The governor's granted Milford a new trial and we're to take him back to the mainland with us. Are you Milford? Will you get him? Norman Milford's dead. Okay buddy, save the taxpayer's some money. I don't know why I did that. May have to go through another trial, maybe end up here again. Yeah, I do know why. I don't want to go back ever. Lee was right, this is home now. Hello, who are you? I'm Dana.
