These teams will represent Angkasa Elementary... ... to compete in Regional Science Competition at Kemah Kreatif. And for their team leader, we agreed it will be... ... please give it up for, Naura! Thank you. Sir! Why Naura? My team's score is higher than Naura's. As a class president, Naura had led her class to win a quiz competition. And she also won first prize in junior flag ceremony championship. So we think it's better it led by a student with more experience. - All right, Sir. Thank you. - Cheer up. - Good afternoon, Sir. - Afternoon. Hey, Bim. What's wrong with him? Bye, guys. Take care. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, honey. - Yeah. - You're home. - Hey, guys. - How's school? - Great, yeah. - Really? - I made a GPS at school. - Really? - I won a prize! - For what? - I'll tell you inside, let's go. - Okay, get in, kids. - Do you still want to go camping? - Of course. You've been asking me that the whole week. - Because you're going to a forest. - Yeah, so? Forest is cool. It's forest. It's only be for two days. Don't worry. - There's no hot bath there. - But I won't stay there long. You can't get a hot bath, and mosquitos are everywhere. At least I'll get to learn new things. Hey, my teacher told me that we shouldn't talk while eating. Understood? - Okay, finish your food first. - Can I be excused? - Okay. - Bye-bye. I'll tuck you in later. I've read in the newspaper a man was mauled by a tiger in Situ Gunung. - Why are you laughing? - Dad, the news was from 1973. The incident happened in Situ Gunung. I know, Situ Gunung is situated in Gunung Gede Pangrango. The park area is around 100.000 hectare. There are many rare trees grow there. Aren't you afraid to see a tiger? There are silvery gibbons, owls, common treeshrews, and many more.

Boss will be waiting for us in Banten tomorrow night at 8 P.M. We have to do inventory check. Understand? Hey, did you listen to me at all? Stop playing games. Where's Jawil? - I thought he was behind me. - Where is he? Jawil? Where the heck is he? He walks too slow. Shoot it! No! Don't shoot! It's me, Jawil. - What were you thinking? - What? You told me that we're going to catch some animals. We have to look like them to gain their trust. You do understand that we are professional thieves, right? We can catch animals without your stupid costum. - Okay? - Okay. We only have 10 minutes. You watch the door. And you come with me. Here's the rifle. - Stay here. - Go away. Careful. Which one first? That one. Hello. Have you eat? No? I'll go get your food. Don't go anywhere. Somebody's coming. Hurry up. Come here. Hello, here. What is that boy doing here this early? If we get caught, we're doomed. Get well soon, okay? What is that? What happened? I got shot. - Hey, be careful! - Can you hold this rifle for me? I got shot too. - You didn't forget the repellent? - No, Dad. - How about your jacket and... - My clothes, my socks, pain medicine. You've checked with me four times already. - Stay out of trouble. - Yeah. - She's 12, don't worry. - I know. And as a team leader, you should prioritized your teammates. - Yes, Mom. - And be responsible. - Yes, Mom. - If you work hard... You can conquer the universe. - Bye, Mom. - Take care, I'm gonna miss you. - It's only for two days. - Be a good girl. - Don't worry, Dad. - It's only for two days. - Be careful honey. - Bye! My name is Miss Laras. I'm the person in charge in Kemah Kreatif. I'm going to do head count. But first, I want team leaders from each school to come forward. Make a line. Hey, guys. This is our schedule. Okay? But before we go, have you checked all of our stuff? - Sure. - How about you, Bim? - Have you? - Yeah. Bimo, can you stop playing game for a second? Bim! Can you stop playing? Poor animals. We're lucky we have national parks such as Situ Gunung. Yes? What did you say? They stole lots of them. Don't worry. Your GPS is upgradeable, and you will save these animals. All of them. "Slippery Trio allegedly hiding in Lampung" Did you just pranked me? - Yeah, you! - What did I do? Don't act innocent. Do you think I didn't know? - What did I do? - You tickled my nose. - I did not! - Don't lie, admit it! - I swear, I didn't do it, Bimo. - You're embarrasing our school. - Bimo, Okky, what's going on? - I don't know, he suddenly. She keeps pranking me. Admit it! Just take a nap, kids. Everybody else too. You're going to have a long day today. Is it raining? - Get up. - All right! Where are we? Sleepy head. Get up! Quit it. - Good morning, kids. - Morning. I can't hear you. One more time. - Good morning, kids! - Morning! Now that's the spirit for Kemah Kreatif Science Championship. That's enough, Mr. Marsono. Thank you. My name is Ms. Tike. I'm the head rangers of Kemah Kreatif. Actually I wanted to show you the beauty of the nature here today. I wanted to show you the protected animals we protect in this park. We have them all. But unfortunately, I have to go to Jakarta. But don't worry, my assistants will show you around for me. Let's give it up for, Mr. Marsono! - I'm over here, Ma'am. - Mr. Marsono. Let's give it up for Mr. Marsono. Okay, everybody. Good, morning! Okay. Kemah Kreatif, I want to hear your voice! Maybe too much from my end. All right then, before we... ... do the head count, I will tell you a very funny story. - You may... - That's not necessarry, Mr. Marsono. Thank you. Let's give it up again to Mr. Marsono. Okay, before we start... ... I want one student to come up to the stage... ... to read the Kemah Kreatif Oath. Come up here.

You know what I mean. - Yes, Ma'am. - I'll see you soon, let's go. - Sir? Sir, are you okay? - That's disgusting. I'm working out. - What are you doing here? - I want to report something. I think there's something strange in the animal quarantine. - What do you mean strange? - I went there this morning and... ... here's my note. I wrote down my report. - And I found... - What were you doing... ... in the quarantine that early? - You should be in bed on that time. - I have to feed the animals. I was afraid I couldn't make it, because of Kemah Kreatif event. They've been feed. - Excuse me. - Come in. - Miss Yayas. - Sorry to interrupt. Interrupt? Nonsense, sit down. - Thank you, but I'm in a hurry. - Relax. - Sit down with Mr. Marsono. - Okay. - So, what happened? - Well. I forgot to hand out these forms to the kids. But now I have to prepare for outdoor activities. I just want to ask you if you can hand out these forms for me? Of course. Anything for you, Miss Yayas. - It's Laras. - I know, Miss Yayas. Wait here. Come here, Pli. Yes, sir. Here, make sure all the participants get these forms, okay? Everyone should get them, okay? And, excuse us. I have to keep coordinating with my staffs. About the quarantine, we'll talk about it later, okay? - Yes, Sir. - Good boy. Now, leave. Excuse me. Of course, bageur. What is bageur? - You don't know what it means? - No. - Bageur means 'good boy'. - Good boy, like me? One, two, three. Look at them. Cool. Okky, do you have any science project, for caring animals or something? I don't think so. - But I can make dry ice bomb and... - What? Another water rocket? That's an old stuff. Not many children can build my water rocket. Trust me, my drone will win this competition. But the theme of this competition is "Love the Nature". And your drone doesn't fit the theme. You're right, that's why we're going to use your GPS. Her GPS still needs a lot of work. It couldn't get any signal in-door. The judges ask that, we don't have the answer. And what if they ask you what your drone has to do with nature? My drone scored the highest in our school competition. I mean, what can it do to nature?

It doesn't matter, as long as we stick together as a team. You may sit down and relax. I mean, if you two touch my drone, you only get in my way. Bye. Have you fill out the form? Where are you going... ... Naura? I want to walk around the camp. Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. - Don't worry. - So? How long have you been working here, Kipli? Wait, thank you. Three years. How did they hire you? I used to live in a village near the Situ Gunung Park. And when my parents passed away... ... Miss Tike and the rangers asked me to live here. How about your school? I'm still going to school. I'm in fifth grade now. They said my salary is used to pay my school tuition, Cepot. - You really love... - Cepot, this is Cepot. He always finds me wherever I go, and likewise. Not even siblings would do that to each other. So you're his little brother, and he is your big brother? No way. I'm his big brother. - Can your GPS be attached to Cepot? - This one? Of course. Here, Cepot. Cepot is smart. He can put it on himself. The boss is furious. How do we leave this place? I don't want to waste our time collecting the animals and... Shut up. Hold this. - Damn, I'm stuck. - Be careful. Lift me up. What do you see? Let me see. Is it working? It's working, yes. It's so cool. Don't worry, we'll know where he goes. Someone's coming. This is the perfect place. Hey, they have toilet over there. I can't hold it any longer. Do you want me to pee in my pants? You're not circumcised? Are you scared? - Shut up! - He's not circumcised. - What are you laughing at? - You're so lucky. - You can have some of my luck. - Gross. Hey, look where you're going! Do you have a dead wish? - Tell him to get out. - Get out of the car. Say it again. What's wrong with my eyes? - What's wrong with my eyes! - I'm sorry. I said the apple of my eye. - I'm so sorry. - Are you trying to be funny? Where are you going? Go ahead, turn it on. Hey! Where have you been? You're late. We've been waiting for you! Are you stupid? Get on the stage in 10 minutes. Okay, Ma'am. Let's go. (Outbound and Fitness) - They look professional. - I think so too. - Let's hire them again next year. - Gladly. It's like aerobic... Try it.

Cepot, come here. - Cepot! - Cepot! - Where is he? - Over there. - Cepot! Cepot. - Come here. - Cepot! - Sorry. Cepot? Cepot. - Come here, boy. - He took my propeller. Are you a spy from other elementary school team? Bim, stop accusing him. He gains nothing from sabotaging your project. Is he at it again? Cepot, come here. Give it back to them! Cepot! Cepot! - Hey Cepot! - Cepot! - My goodness. - Cepot! - Cepot! - Cepot! - Cepot? - Cepot! - My God. - Cepot! Wait, I'm going to open it. God. They're stealing the animals. Okky. Don't get involved with this. We have to go back to camp. We came here for the competition. We have to be number one. We have to keep them from stealing our animals. Pli? Pli? Hit them in the head. Don't shoot them with dart. You're only wasting our tranqulizer. Okay. Let's go down. Why didn't you lock the door? Who opened it? I don't know. - I remember I locked it. - Nonsense. Check the cages. Is there anything missing? The snake is still in there. I don't get it. Darn it. We have a flat tire. Call the boss. Come in, Cebong Bewok. Cebong Bewok, what's wrong? - We have a flat tire. - How can that happen? It's okay. Kipli, the three of us must go back to camp. We still have a chance to win. We have to get my propeller back. We can't win without it. - And then we go back. - No way. We have to go back right now. Use my project. See. You're conspiring to sabotage... Bim! You want all the victory to yourself. We're a team. The only project that's ready for this competition is Okky's. Yes, right. You always blame us for everything. You're selfish. How wonderful. You only think about yourselves. Kipli! Are you going to just stand there... ... while they destroy this forest, and steal the animals? I know you're smart, but you only think about showing off a trophy. Pathetic. Kipli, do you think you can handle them yourself? You can't play this game, trust me. That's easy. Move it here. - Leave me alone, go away. - You don't need to push me. - I said, move it here. - Keep your fingers off my phone. No, I won't. What was that? What is it? Look, up there! What's that? Wait for me! Cover me too. - We have to be quick. - Let's go. Slowly, don't make a noise. - What's wrong? - What is it, Nau? - Lower your voice. - Okay. - Is there a problem?/ - Who came last? He did. Where's Okky? What is this? I feel something wet and warm. Did you pee in your pants? Sorry, I can't help it. I was too scared to do it outside. Are you stupid or something? Why did you pee in the car? Ghost! - Get out. - It's you, okay, Bang Jalu. Stop struggling. Don't even think of running away. Where did you find this boy? - Do you know him? - How do I know? Why did you scare us with those creepy noises? Do you want to scare us? So that's the person. - Where are your friends? - Answer him. I said, where are your friends? I'm, I work alone. Quick, tie him up. Don't just stand there. Fix the tire! - Help! Somebody help me! - Hey, shut up! Can you just quiet? Go up. Don't forget to hose the car seat. I've been peed on two times in just one day. - Did you pee in your pants? - I did. - I know you've done that too before. - Embarrassing. - How's the tire? - One more screw. You're too slow. - Done. - Are you sure? Let's go. - They're taking Okky with them. - And the animals too. I was rude to him. But he sacrificed himself for us. And there's nothing we can do to help him. Hurry up, move. - How? - No sign of them yet. - Have you look for them everywhere? - We did, Sir. Don't worry, Miss Yayas. Kids are like little chicks. Just scatter some corn kernels and they'll come home when they're hungry. Don't joke around. This is Situ Ginung. This park is so big. - Situ Gunung! - Whatever. Whatever? What if they got lost and mauled by wild animals? The wild animals won't dare to go near them. I trained those kids to fight wild animals, just relax. Look, I haven't even scatter the kernels. Where have you been? I've been worried sick. Are you all right? Where's Okky? Okky, he got kidnapped by animal thieves. Are you lying to us? - Are you? - Mr. Marsono. What's wrong with you? Mr.Marsono! - We're not lying. - See! We saw it when they kidnapped Okky. And what are you doing here, Kipli? Shouldn't you help the rangers for Kemah Kreatif event? And you, Bimo. You were fighting with Okky. You made Okky ran away, right? Enough! - Let's go. - Where are you going? - Rangers. - Yes, Sir. - You two standby here. - Yes, Sir. What are you looking for? Mr. Marsono, Miss Laras, we found no sign of Okky. Tell me from the beginning. What is really happening? I can explain, Ma'am. Miss Yayas. Don't worry too much about the kids. - Just relax. - Relax you said? - What if he really was kidnapped? - Did you mean the animal theft? - Yes, that too. - Listen to me. One, I've been working here for many years. And not once I've heard about animal theft here. And two, Okky ran away after he had a quarrel with Bimo. That's the reason he's missing. And most importantly, three. If they really want to steal the animals from this park... ... they have to do it over my dead body. - Right? - You're unbelievable. Are you talking about me? - Yes! - I know. Where are you going? I haven't finish talking. Is she sulking? - Okay, everybody ready? - Yes, Sir. Keep your radio on. Report to me if you find something important. - Yes, Sir. - Miss Yayas will lead... ... the search team on the east side of the forest. What are you waiting for? Are you waiting for me to make you go? Move! - Sir? - Now what, Kipli? Why are you ordered them to search on the east side of the forest? - The kidnappers went to... - Who's in charge here? Me or you? Listen, stop arguing with me, understand? I can report you to Miss Tike. I'dl tell her that you always against my order. - But I didn't... - You just did! I can persuade Miss Tike to fire you too. No more arguing, just do what you've told, get it? - Yes, Sir. - Good boy. Don't make a sound. You will wake the others. We have to do something. We can't let them take away Okky. - Lower your voice. - Bimo. Is that a DIY compass? Li, I think Mr. Marsono know this forest like the palm of his hand. I don't get it if he doesn't know the difference between west and east. Of course, he's been working here for four years. He was transferred from our national park in Sumatera. He was... That reminds me of something. We never had a chance to talk again about the quarantine. What's wrong, Li? Can you help me with something? - What something? - Just something. Have you found it? We can't stay here too long. Okay, be patient. Ugly 1, Ugly 2, Ugly 3. Why didn't you turn on your radio? Do you think I'm a debt collector? Sorry, boss. The connection here is bad. And got worse with the rain. It's not the rain. I can see you relaxing in a hut. That would interfere with the connection too. Did he install spy camera here? - Yes, Sir. I'm sorry. - Finish your job and go. And if that kid run away, I'll feed you to the crocodile. Yes, Sir. Let's go. - One second. - Stop playing games. I found this tranquilizer in the quarantine area. They kept one of the animal in the quarantine. Ranger's tranquilizers are not red. We have to tell Miss Laras and the rangers. Stop moving. What are you going to do? You are caught in the act, kids. Stop it! How dare you sneak into my office. Get in there. - Don't bite me! - Let me go! Get in! Hurry up! Hurry up! Listen carefully. Pray before you go to bed, and remember my advise. Don't play heroes. Understand? You are little kids! Don't make any noise. Mr. Marsono wants to sleep. Okky! Okky! - Okky! - Okky. Okky! Well? Any sign? Nothing. - We've gone deep into the forest. - What do you want us to do? Okky! - Where is he? - Okky! Okky! - Okky! - Where are you Okky? What's wrong? This cup is still look fresh. - This came from our stock, right? - Yes. What if he's near here? Okay, let's search a little farther. We haven't search that way. Okky! Just a second, Bim. What? Check the door, I'll untie Bimo. Help! Help! Help! It won't budge. Help! Cepot. Is that Naura's GPS? The GPS cannot be tracked... ... indoor. Hide yourself. I can't hold it. Can you pull over? I can't hold it. Shut up! Stop banging the partition. I have to pee. This young master need to go to the bathroom. Are you hungry, too? Hold it a little longer. There's a stall not far from here. You can pee in their toilet, and we'll have dinner there. - Right? - Yeah. Do you think we're online taxi? Get out! Hurry up! Hurry! How? I can't open the door. Let me try again. Help! I'm sorry, Bim, Li. It's my fault we fail to win this competition. We failed to rescue Okky.

We can't contact them, I'm serious. They keep our phone in that cottage. We have to act alone. We don't have much time. We have to rescue Okky, before we report them to the police. Are you sure they're the fitness instructors from yesterday? Me, Bimo and Kipli saw it with our own eyes. Like I said, Mr. Marsono is the brain of animal theft here. But they're older and they are bigger than us. - Are you sure? - Definitely. We can win as a team. Naura will lead us.

Maybe they have reached their destination? I don't think so. They're still around the mountainside. - I know a shortcut. - Let's go. Push! Kill the engine! Are you kidding me? And you call yourselves professionals? You can't even push a car stuck in mud. Push again. Push! Speak to yourself. I got mud in my mouth. Step on it! Let me push the car, you get behind the wheel. - What about him? - What about him? - Are you serious? - Sure. You push the car, I get behind the wheel? - Hurry up! - Why not? I've been waiting for that. Hurry up! Step on it! One, two... Step on it! Jawil? Jawil! - What are you doing here? - Get back in the car. I'll push it, I won't complain. I'm not good at driving. I don't want the car to slip deeper into the mud. - What's wrong with you? - Come on, quick. Why don't you admit that you can't drive? Shut up. I can teach you how to drive, lousy... - You scared me. - Sorry, Boss. Don't you know I have a heart condition? Why didn't you tell me? We're getting closer. Something's wrong with the wheel. Are you trying to run away? Are you? Let me see the ties. Let me see it. What is that? Turn around. Turn around! Open your hand. What is this? Your trick can't fool us. Don't do anything stupid. Stop, we've lost the signal. - What's wrong? - Your GPS lost the signal? I think so, if we lost the signal, we can't continue our pursue. The risk is too high. Once we can't track the GPS, we can't catch up with them. I have my drone, but the battery is low. What if it crashes mid-way? Don't worry. We have a Savonius. Sinsin. So, if you turn right on the crossing over there. - That crossing? - Yes, that crossing. There's a canopy trail. The bridge is quite high, you can fly your drone from there. All right then, Bimo and I will stay here and charge the battery. - You guys can keep moving. - Now, can I borrow your device? Thank you. Okay, let's keep walking. I'll explain our plan on the way. - Let me out! - Shut up! You too, I can't believe you can't even handle a kid. Yes, boss. But I'm as small as children. That's the importance of eating your veggies. Look, we have plenty here. - Let me out! - Shut up! What are you looking at? Boss, I think there's a carnival over there. - Carnival? - Yeah. What carnival? It's not Independence Day. What carnival are you talking about? Let me see. What the, this is a disaster. Boss, I think we broke the car wheel. The wheel or the car? - Yeah, I mean the car wheel. - All right, fix it. Keep on moving. I have to continue my duty as a ranger, keep an eye on that kid. I've never seeen anyone who can't handle one kid. Ridiculous. Nau, I'm tired. Can we stop a minute? Drink this. I think we should continue searching for Okky... ... on our way back to the camp. - We can still search further. - No, we should go back now. What is this? Prepare your gears to cross the river. Hello, Miss Tike? I think we have a problem here. Okay. Be careful. It's slippery. - Has it charged yet? - Yes. - I'll let Kipli know. - Okay. Kipli, do you copy? No answer. - Kipli, do you copy? - I'm in Nau. - We're in position. - Okay Nau, ready. Okay. Let's cross the bridge. What? Are you scared? Let's go. Nau. Yes, Bim? Let's go. Keep moving. This is for our friend. This is for Okky. - But it's wobbly. - All right, listen to me. - If you work hard. - If you work hard. - You can conquer the universe. - You can conquer... - ... the universe. - Repeat again, Bim. If you work hard... ... you can conquer the universe. If you work hard, you can... ... conquer... ... the universe. Hold on. Cepot! Cepot! Keep walking. And on the top of the path, split up. Okay, let's go. Target locked. - My drone is spying on the car. - Good job, Bim. Kipli, do you copy? The car is on the way down the mountain. ... driving this car. You're driving too slow. Like a snail on the way to a date. I know. Can you even drive? Do you want me to get a ticket? I don't have a driving license. I'm too small to get one. - Excuse me, but we're in a forest. - So? You can't get a ticket when there's no police here to give you. Quick, slide down! Quick. Hurry up! Somebody help me! Naura, Bimo, Kipli! Help me! First and second attack have failed. - What should we do? - We failed. Kipli, do you copy? Get Team 2 ready. - Ready? - The car is coming. Hide. Hurry up. - What is happening? - A little to the right. Stop the car! - My goodness. - Somebody help! Hurry! What is that? - Retreat! - Okay! Turn around! Retreat! Retreat! - Go straight! - Okay. Turn around! I think we're lost. We'd better go back on the track. We can't go back. We almost crashed there, remember? - Kipli, are you copy? - Yes, Nau. Get Team 3 ready to attack. Look out! - Can you drive? - Shut up you two. I should've been behind the wheel. Get out of the car. Hurry up. - I'm stuck, I'm too heavy. - Faster! I think I broke my shoulder. - Stop pretending. - I think I really broke my shoulder. We almost died. The car is broken. - What is that? - Bees! - Run! - Let's go. Have you hooked your rope yet? I did. - Let's go. We have to join the team. - Okay. - Hurry up! - I'll catch up with you. - What do you mean? - I'll catch up with you. - All right, but stay close to me. - All right. - Hurry up, Bim. - Okay. Nau, get back here. I really admire your spirit. But don't ever think that you can beat me. Nau, get back here. So, go back to that tree slowly, or I'll shoot you. - One! - Shut up, Bim. - Nau. - Two! - Get back here. - I'm coming, Bim. Three! We give up! - Don't do it, Sir! - I will do it! - Please, don't do it. - I will do it! - Please, Sir. - I will do it! Don't. Good bye! Help! - Mr. Marsono! - Miss Tike, please help us! Arrest him. Okay. I surrender. Hurry up. Let's go! - Where are you taking me? - Miss Tike! Don't give me that innocent look. Look what you've done. They are here. Yes, Miss Yayas? - So you're behind all this. - Who me? Yes! You've been a ranger for 10 years, I can't believe you. What do I get from 10 years working here? What? - How could you? - What? I can't buy a car with my salary, let alone a house. I deserve more! - Marsono! - What? I'm sorry, Miss Tike. - You deserve a prison cell. - That's right! Shut up all of you. Look what you've done to me. Look at this. Who screw this up? - Miss Laras! - Miss Laras! Hey, Nau. Where's Bimo? Thanks, Bim.
