Rebecca, you did a fantastic job with the merger, but with the consolidation, your position here just is no longer required. But I thought that I was being promoted to... senior vice president? Yes!No. Sorry. I trusted you. You said that you were gonna take care of me. The company is prepared to offer you a very generous severance package. But I made this deal happen! Becks, come on.

Get my money back. Sorry, Rebecca. That's okay. I didn't buy you anything. Then I guess I'll drive down to Florida and spend the holidays with my folks. How about you? Well, I'm not gonna let the dust settle on this one. I made this merger happen. I could do it again. This time with someone who appreciates me. This is Rebecca. Hi. I haven't gotten your RSVP. I'm getting worried. I'm sorry. I've been swamped with work. In that case, I think you should take some time off and celebrate by getting your workaholic butt here for my wedding. I don't know.

Yeah, I'm sure that you heard about the big deal that I engineered between Gannon-Foley and Lincoln. Yes, you're right. That merger was very, very big. Now, here's the deal. I am prepared to bring that exact same kind of expertise to Ketchum & Mitchell. Yes. Yes, that is right, but I only want to move up. Okay? No lateral moves for Rebecca Wesley. I mean, that wouldn't make very much sense now, would it? Great. Great. Yeah, I would love to speak with you. How does, um, Christmas Day sound? Oh, you're going to be with your family? Oh. Yes, of course. I'm also very close with my family, so... I will call you Monday. Thank you. Okay, let's see. Hi, this is Rebecca Wesley. Is Mr. Madison in? Oh, not till after Christmas. Yeah...

Unfortunately, I've got to open the diner. It's pretty dead around the holidays, but the sign says open seven days a week. Well, business is business, right? Well, there are people who depend on me, you know. Folks with no family. Where would they go if I wasn't there for them? Why do you care? I don't know, Rebecca. I just do. Take some nice pictures at the ceremony, okay? Oh, I'm sure they'll post a bunch online. Well, I'm not really good at that stuff, so thank you. I will take some pictures for you then. You know, couldn't you possibly take a later flight? Why would I do that? I don't know. I don't know. It's just that... I've haven't seen you in a long, long time. Mom... Your dad died.

How about a lesson?How about not? I'll be here all day tomorrow morning if you change your mind! Skate to be great! Oh... Would you like to buy some Christmas cookies? Cookies? No, I don't want to buy any cookies. Cookies make you fat, and especially during the holidays, there's a lot of temptation. So, no, I don't want to buy your cookies. Becky! Hi? It's me, Jenny! Jenny.

When Allison and Mark told me that they met at a Christmas party many years ago, I realized why this was such a special day. And here we are on this magical Christmas Eve to join them in the beginning of their journey as one. The ring is traditionally placed on the fourth finger because the ancient Greeks believed that there was a vein in that finger that led directly to the heart. Always loved that.

Well, my friends say that I'm married to my job. How about you? Well, after college, I went to Paris, learned to cook. I spent seven years there. I met a girl. Thought I had everything figured out, but I figured wrong. That fell apart three years ago. She was always on the go, always had someplace else she needed to be that was more important. Our lives didn't mesh. Too busy to settle down. Imagine that. So I came back here a year ago and opened up my restaurant, and I'm not sorry I did. I really love it here. I missed it. Mm. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? I was hoping to grab a drink... and a kiss. Just like old times. Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! The Pioneers! A mighty sight!

[laughing] She's making it up. I swear. Speaking of crushes, how come you two broke up? In high school, you were inseparable. Study hall, lunch period. I don't know. Why don't you ask Miss Hot Pants over there. Don't look at me. I know how to keep my man happy. Look, Rebecca went to New York, and I went to Paris. Well, I wouldn't have let this one get away. All right, all right, if I could get everybody's attention, please. I'd like to introduce you all to a very special friend of the bride's. She's your maid of honor, Molly Townsend! Molly! As I look around the room today, I can see just how much has happened since high school. Some folks have gained weight. Some have had babies. Some folks have let their hair grow out, and others have let their hair fall out. And many people have found a soul mate and fallen in love. All I want to know is, what took you guys so long? [snorting laugh] I thought even Rebecca would've been married by now! [snorting laugh] Who knew? Thank you. Rebecca? How was the wedding? [knocking] Not now, Mom! Chad's here. Thank you, Mrs. Wesley.You're welcome. [sniffling] Your mom always did make the best apple pie. I'm not really in the mood for small-town chit-chat, Chad. Can I help you? I really just wanted to talk to you. I'm just not really in a chatty mood. Look, what Molly said at the wedding was inappropriate. She is just jealous because you seem to have everything, and she's still a cocktail waitress. A cocktail waitress? Yeah. Well, um, anyway, after all these years, she's still just a really mean girl. Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway, though. Because, like you said, I do have everything. Fair enough. It's not like you're stuck in this one-horse town. I never said this was a one-horse town. [sighs] I just meant it's not New York. Do you ever think about it? Think about what? What might have happened if... you hadn't walked away? No. I don't waste my time on unproductive pursuits such as daydreaming. Daydreaming? Look, I've seen you once in the past ten years. What do you expect? I don't know. We're both adults. Let's take a chance. We were good once. We were perfect together. I used to think that, too. Once. So, have lunch with me tomorrow. Why don't you ask Molly? I have something pretty important I need to get back to New York for. Business is business, right? Well... So long, Becky. Safe travels. I hope you get everything you wanted. I already have it. I meant for Christmas. See you, Mrs. Wesley.Bye, Chad. He's still crazy about you. He had his chance. It's all water under the bridge now. You're still angry. He betrayed me. That was in high school. It doesn't matter when it was, Mom. I was so na ve. I trusted him. And, honestly, I thought that I would feel differently, but you should have seen them today. She still wants him. But he wants you.

What do you mean they can't see you? You're right... Oh, I get it. I hit my head on the taxi window when you swerved to miss that car. So, this isn't real. I'm dreaming, right? Rebecca, it's Christmastime. Don't you believe in magic? No. All you need to know is that when a soul like yours is stuck in a destructive cycle, fate will step in and show you the way. Hey, listen. I am not stuck in a self-destructive cycle, okay? I am exactly where I'm supposed to be, Mister Whoever You Are. Well, then why is this happening to you? Okay. I will play along, Mr. Destiny. How will fate show me the error of my ways? Oh, I can't tell you that. Why not? Because it's fate. Okay. So, what? I'm stuck here? I need to keep doing the same thing over and over again? Yeah. How many times? Until you find the answer to the question. And what is the question? Why? Why is the question? Yes. Wow. That's deep. You're back! I was just writing you a note.

You're really not embracing the question that fate has led you to. Wait a second. Who is this? Your ticket is valid on Christmas Day and not a day sooner. I'm sorry. Ugh! [bell tolls] [bell tolls] Oh! I need to talk to you. I'm a little busy right now. Is it important? During the wedding, you said that life was a journey, and even though the road may double back, it's all part of this master plan, or something like that. How do you know that? Oh, please, I just need to know what it all means. But I... I just wrote this this morning, and I haven't shown it to anyone. When you say double back, do you mean literally? Well, I meant that... or I will mean that although there are many obstacles and unexpected turns in the road that we all eventually end up where we're supposed to be. So God pushes us?

She had her hands all over you. Who are you? What... What happened to the old Rebecca? The one that I fell in love with? The one you cheated on? Yeah, she's gone now. She's been replaced by a better Rebecca. The new stronger, smarter, savvier Rebecca is in charge now. Is she?Mm-hmm. Yeah, I make things go my way, or they don't go at all. Becky... Just leave me alone. Hey!What? What you run off like that for? It was embarrassing, and I was just trying to be nice. There are a lot of girls here. Why don't you go be nice to one of them?

I feel like I'm losing my mind. Under a lot of pressure lately? I mean, I guess. I wish I knew what to do. Well, whenever I'm feeling stuck, I... I do something I've never done before. Just cut loose, you know?[chuckles] Yeah, I know. I actually already did that. And? I got arrested. Really?Yeah. How'd that go? Pretty good, actually. I've got to get to the diner. But think about what I said, you know? Just keep it simple. And legal. [laughs]Okay. Hey, Mom? Yeah. You don't have to go to work today, do you? I mean... I thought maybe we could spend the day together. Goodness. That doesn't sound like you. I know. Well, it's not the same since your father passed away, but I really can't imagine this town without it. So many memories. I know. All of them good ones. I should've come home after Dad died. I should've helped you. You wanted a career. I wanted an excuse. I was a pretty good daddy's girl, but... I'm lousy daughter. I don't blame you for being angry with me. Angry? Is that why you stayed away all these years, because you thought I was angry with you? I mean, you have every right to be. Disappointed, yes... but not angry. You are my daughter. Your Dad and I were always so proud of you. I'm so sorry, Mom. Oh...So sorry. It's all right. It's always been all right. You hungry? I'll fix you something to eat. Okay. You should go easy with that, you know. It's a good little hike to Allison's wedding. I know. I'm wearing holes in my shoes.

I mean, how often do you get to attend the same wedding five or six times? True. Yeah, you're darn right. So, I see you're having a good time. Is that your Porsche parked in the driveway? Mm-hmm. I figure if I have to keep doing the same day over and over again, might as well do it in style. And isn't that what credit cards are for? Rebecca, can I give you some advice? Can I stop you? Christmas is not about fancy cars or fancy clothes. Instead of thinking about things you can hold in your hand, it's time to think about things you can hold in your heart. [snorts] Have you been reading your fortune cookie again? No, not this time. Well, if you're talking about Chad, it's all water under the bridge. Is it? Mr. Scrooge! [laughing] Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge! I wonder. Hmm... Mm. Cheese and bacon rock. I forgot how much I miss this. I thought you city girls watched your weight. We do, but even us city girls can indulge during the holidays. [laughing] Well, well, the bride to be! Hi! Coffee?Thank you. Come on. Sit down. Look who's here. Hi.Becky, you made it! Oh, my goodness, of course. I wouldn't miss this day even if I could. Have a seat. Oh. Hungry, huh? You want some?No, thanks. I don't wanna be fat.Well, I don't either. I mean, thin is in, and I will be starting my new diet on Christmas Day. Thanks, Mom.You're welcome. Can I get you anything to eat? How about a poached egg on a dry piece of wheat toast? Done.Thanks. I have worked my butt off to lose 15 pounds for this wedding. You know, it's funny. We live our lives according to these perfect little schedules. You know, we get diet tips, how to stay in shape, how to land a husband. And for what? When is the last time anyone kind of sat back and let things happen? Is that really you talking? The girl who couldn't stop working long enough to come home for Christmas? She's around here somewhere. It's really good to see you. I feel like every time we talk on the phone, I just feel like you're drifting away. Yeah, maybe I was. But I think coming home has really helped me to take stock. You know? I've been doing a lot of thinking. Here you go. Thanks. Have you talked to Chad? He was asking about you at the rehearsal dinner last night. I have a question. How come he and Molly never got together after I went away? Why you talking about? Molly? Well, you know, Molly, remember? They hooked up at Gage's party in twelfth grade? I don't know what you're talking about. Allison! Don't you remember? He made out with her. Wait. Is that what you think? You think that Molly and Chad were having some hot romance behind your back? That's the truth, isn't it? Is that really why you broke up with him? Well, that and, you know, we just kind of drifted apart. Oh, well, last time I checked, you're here and he's here, so why don't you drift back together again? Well, I think I'm gonna go. Big day ahead of me. Yeah. You're not gonna eat that?No. Oh, okay. Cool. Good luck.Thanks. I'll see you later. You know it. [laughing] ♪ It's funny how time doesn't fly ♪ ♪ Isn't life all about second chances? ♪ Wow. After all these years, you still remember. Of course. Feels like it was just yesterday. Did you get a load that ceremony? It tied the knot. It certainly did. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? No, you're not interrupting. We're just talking. Right? Actually, this is an "A" and "B" conversation. You could just "C" your way out of it. Wow, so high school. Let me guess. You two never resolved your issues? Take a walk with me? Be scared not to. Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Thank you.You're welcome. Well, that must be challenging, running a restaurant. It has its moments.Hmm. I just feel like I would be so worried about what people thought. Is the food good enough? Is the service okay? And if it isn't, are people gonna tell me? Well, sometimes you just got to trust your instincts. Well, that's easy for you to say. [sighs] I have trouble trusting people. You have problems trusting yourself? Sometimes. You know, sometimes we lie to ourselves, Chad. That's true. And I wouldn't be lying if I told you that I'm really happy you're standing here right now. No lie? No lie. I'm really sorry. For what? All these years, I shut you out because you cheated on me with Molly, and I should have confronted you so you could explain what happened. Rebecca, I don't know what you heard or who told you, but I never cheated on you. I was crazy about you. I guess it's not important now. You know, when I heard you weren't coming, that you'd gotten all successful and too busy to be bothered, I thought to myself, "That's not the Rebecca I remember." Not the girl I fell in love with. I'm saying I was wrong. We all were. We thought you got all big city on us, but that's not the girl who's standing in front of me right now. Yes, it is. The girl who's too busy for her friends, who can't be bothered to comfort her own mother. That girl is me. I don't believe it. You're here, aren't you? Yeah, I am. And I bet you're having a little bit of fun, too. Well, I did sucker punch a guy and get arrested. So, what do you do for fun? I don't even know where to start. Well, what about ice skating? Ice skating?Mm-hmm. You hated ice skating. Well, no. I hated falling down. But people change. Do you not remember falling on your face and almost breaking your wrist? That was then, and this is now. Are you scared?No! I thought you were in a big hurry to get out of town. I'm done with schedules and regimens. Hi. I would like to sign up for some skating lessons, please. At your service. So, you finally want to learn how to cook? Well, I want to impress a friend. Ah! And this special friend wouldn't happen to be a chef, would he? He might be. Then we better start with the simple stuff. Oh, yes. Butter... The most important part about ice skating is knowing how to balance. It's just like roller skating, only you're on ice. Capiche?I think I got it. [laughing] Okay. Let's give it a try. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.Whoa. Steady.Whoa, whoa. [laughing] Good, good. Good. Oy. Here we go.Oh, my God. Now, I want you to kick off with your right foot and slowly glide out. Get a little momentum going. Okay? Nice and easy. Come on. Go ahead. Go ahead. Good. That's it. Easy. Careful. [man] Whoa! [sighing] Stay down. [gasps] Oh, sorry, baby. How am I doing, Sam? Never better, tiger! Look out, world! [sighing] Ay! [pastor] There is always a destination at the end of the road. No matter how many times it may double back on us, And that... is one of life's great miracles.[Rebecca snoring] [snoring continues]And... another miracle might... Is she snoring? [snoring] [bell tolls] Thank you. ♪ It's funny how time doesn't fly ♪ ♪ Isn't life all about second chances? ♪ Wow. Becky, I was hoping you were gonna make it. When'd you get in?Yesterday. My mom had to open the diner, so I figured why not come ice skating. They're having a Christmas Eve morning special. You wanna be my partner? I haven't seen you in over 10 years, and the first thing you do is ask me to go ice skating with you? Is this a trick question? People change. I've changed. You hated ice skating. I'm just, you know, trying to broaden my horizons. Plus, I have resolved to do something different every day. Seriously?Well, no, actually, I just keep doing the same thing over and over and over again, but, anyway, the point is I'm here and you're here. You wanna skate with me or not? Yeah. Let's do it. Can you do me a favor real quick? Sure.Just text Rick and tell him to bring the wedding ring. Um... Just trust me. Okay. Hey, hey.[Rebecca] Hey, Joe. Came for my skates. Can I help you? Yes. Blue box under the counter. Perfect. Just my size. Hey, how's the baby? What?Your wife. She delivered last night, right? Right. How do you know? Seven pounds, four ounces. And won't your father-in-law be surprised when he finds out you named him after him. Hiram. Now there's a name you can work with. Have a cigar. Thanks.You coming? Congratulations. Ah!Oh! [laughing] You okay? I think I...Oh, God! Are you okay? I'm okay. All right. That was a good one. [kids laughing] Smooth. Very smooth. Thank you. Hey.Hmm? How was your morning skating? Great. Just great. Great. Come on! I got a mortgage! Would you like to buy some Christmas cookies? Yeah. Actually, I would love to. How many boxes would you like? I'll take them all. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [chuckles] Merry Christmas.Thank you. Here you go.Thank you. [sighing] Merry Christmas. Jennifer! Becky! Hi! Oh, I've missed you so much. You look great. You've lost weight, right? It's so sweet of you to notice. I would love to stay and chat, but I have to go inside. Catch up with you later?Okay. Molly. Rebecca. I just love what you've done with your hair. Uh, thanks. Oh, and one more thing. If you so much as look at Chad, I'll pull every hair out of your lying head. See you guys later. Hey, guys, did you not get the memo? You've been replaced. You're fired. What?Yeah. We'll see you at the reception, but no more singing. The ring is traditionally placed on the fourth finger because the ancient Greeks believed that a vein from that finger was connected to the heart. Always loved that. May I now have the rings? Thank you. Thank you. These rings mark the beginning of your long journey together. Wear them proudly, for they represent the love you have for each other. You may place the ring on her finger. Take and wear this ring as a symbol of my love. With it, I wed you and give you my body, my soul, and my heart. You may place the ring on his finger. Take and wear this ring as a symbol of my love. With it, I wed you and commit my life to you forever. I now pronounce man and wife. You may kiss your bride. [laughing] And did you notice Jennifer's new look? Well, I think she looks great. You know, like a TV weather girl. [laughing] You know, I'm stunned. I'm absolutely stunned. How so? It's you. Everyone said you were going to change, but you're still the same fun-loving, warm, generous girl you were 12 years ago. You haven't missed a beat.Oh, I've missed a few. I missed you. I've missed you, too. What ever happened to us? Oh, I could tell you, but you would just laugh. It's that silly. Think we're just water under the bridge? Not if we don't want to be. Even the course of a mighty river is changed as it bends. Very profound. Thank you. You trust me? [Rebecca] Here we go. We're almost there. Okay.Sorry about the long walk. Yeah.All right, there's a chair right here. Go ahead and have a seat. Take off your blindfold. Ta-da! Wow. What's all this? Well, I wanted to cook you dinner, and you have to be honest. I didn't know you cooked. And you also didn't know that I skated. Dinner is served. Oh, this looks amazing. What are we having? It's a turkey mushroom risotto with white truffle. Mm. Go ahead. Is it terrible? Hmm... No, no. It's perfect, actually. Better than I can make myself. Mm. I spent the last 10 years wondering what happened to that girl I was so crazy about. That girl couldn't cook to save her life. Now, you're like Wonder Woman. I mean, the big career, and ice skating. And where did you find a string section on such short notice? It is Christmastime. Don't you believe in magic? Starting to. A toast. To coming home. To coming home. Now, I know it's traditional for the maid of honor to give a toast at the reception, but I got a special request from a very special young lady. She'd like to say a few words to you all. So, without further ado, let me introduce you to a very special friend of the bride's. Rebecca Wesley! Thank you. [clears throat] Good evening. Allison and Mark, you two are such a wonderful, loving couple. You have the kind of relationship that most people can only dream about. And I'm just so happy that I could be here to share in your special day. They met over 10 years ago, and all that time, they stayed true to who they were. They trusted each other. And they survived the many cracks in the sidewalk that so many other people would have tripped over. And that kind of love and devotion... is why we're all here today. A wise man once told me, marriage is a gift you give yourself, and I never really knew what that meant... until today. You have the greatest gift you could ever receive. You have each other. Allison and Mark, this is my gift to you.

Why are you so shiny when I'm so blue? Someone making bacon? I love bacon. Good morning. So... it's tomorrow? I noticed. I mean, it's Christmas? Really Christmas? All day. Your mom let me in on her way to the diner. That woman is unstoppable. I figured you cooked for me, so I should return the favor. Smells great. You can take it with you if you don't have time to eat it. That's right. It's the 25th. My flight leaves in a few hours. I wish you didn't have to go. [clears throat] [surprised chuckle]Here. When did you have time to buy me something? This I paid for a long time ago. What is it? It's my heart. Chad... [sighing] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [car horn honking] It's my ride. I told you tomorrow would come when you'd earned it. You were right all along. All set?All set. All right. Let me get your bags. I'm actually not leaving. Yeah, I'm not leaving today. I'm not leaving ever. I've been doing a lot of thinking. Sorry to make you come out on Christmas morning. Ah, it's all right. Besides I knew you weren't gonna leave. I couldn't be happier for you. You knew? Then what are you doing here? Eh... This? There's another lost soul who needs it badly. Well, as much as I hate re-gifting, I think I can spare it. Well, my final gift to you will bring you much happiness. You won't need this. There's another gift? The gift of giving love and being loved in return. Thank you. Any big plans for today? You could say that.
