(phone ringing) - The phone is ringing, Hagbard. - Sshh. Hell! Women...! You won't be forced into doing something. Marriage is not a brothel. Then you have to leave him. Yes, you must keep the apartment and everything. I'll be right there, Kirsten. I must go to Kirsten. They must divorce. They also just got married, so ... What do you say? He wants to force her to ... I refuse to say to what. Hagbard, that's awful! I'm taking the car. - She ought to do what he says. - You don't understand anything about it! We have given you everything, - and you have taken her virtue. - I did Einar when she was 16 years old. Have you broken your hymen? Einar probably had some pleasure in it. She lay still and let it happen. Yes, because we are decent women, - who do our duty and let our men have what's theirs. - He had his too, but this morning... - Do not talk about it. That's perverse! I give up. I love Kirsten - and have been faithful to her. But there are limits! You will pay maintenance, you beast! Goodbye. I'll just take a cold beer with the Major in the garden. (clinks bottles) Hagbard! Hagbard, where are you?! - Roooar! - (laughter) You have to stay in shape! An office job requires one to sit on his arse! - Here you go. You need it. - Cheers. - Do you regret leaving the military? - No. - But outside life was fun. - Beer, song and women, huh? - You got a lot, did you? - Yes, but then I met Inger. - You've really been lucky. - You have a wonderful wife. If we were not such good neighbors... Are you telling me she tempts you? Really? That is damned interesting...! The restroom is there. There are handtowels and hot water. It is self-contained; an entire flat. There are baths in the cellar that may be used according to the contract. I had to ban the previous tenant. She ran around in an indecent bathrobe. She was naked underneath! She stood out smoking, with my small boy watching. She got visiters at night. Just awful. My little boy is at a difficult age. She advertised in the newspaper that she enjoyed being raped! Sign here. - Absolutely not, they would never agree. - But the idea is nice to think about. Wife swapping is quite common in America and England. What does all this emancipation do if a man cannot get a roll in the hay? My wife will only do it in the dark. But you are much younger. We do it in the dark too. Inger is so bashful. Then she thinks that the sight of my body ... is disturbing. Even in the dark? Hmm, that is interesting...! Hagbard! ... Hagbard! Hagbard! Good day, Mr. Hansen! Unfortunately I must borrow my husband. I will be there in a moment! We can talk about this later on. There must be a solution. I must speak to the neighbors, and ask them to turn down the radio, if they're going to leave their windows open. Dav, I'm the new tenant. My name is Børge. Egon. I'm a son in this house. I have a darkroom upstairs, but rinse the pictures in the basement. - Do you want to have a beer? - Well thank you. Just watch out for the radio. Are you an amateur photographer? No, professional photographer. I work for an electronics plant ... with a lot of equipment. If there is something particularly exciting, I take them home with me and continue. Like this, for example. Good heavens! It looks like a cunt. You have it upside down. It is an integrated chip, DZ 531. What appears to be hairs are the wires... This is what it looks like in reality. - I am a saleman. I sell quartz lamps. - Yes, you must sell a good many. - Are you happy with the apartment? - Yes. I am newly divorced. I was thrown out into the street. With the button here you draw the curtain from the bed. There is also one to dim the lights. Your mum did not say anything about that. The girl that lived here was good-looking. I thought maybe... - Is there a lot of noise here? - No more than usual. Mum works the night shift every other week. - She watches out for your little brother. - I have no little brother. - She wanted to protect her little boy. - It is me. - It's the army's underwear. - It looks dangerous. You have to get your wife used to the idea. Say it's from your military service. - It's been a long time. - It is also well worn. Make a plan of your bedroom. I'll work out a plan for ours. Does your wife turn on the light afterwards? Yes ... We unscrew the bulbs loose in the night pots. - The lamps? - Yes of course. (lively talk) May I sit here and eat? What are you laughing at? We wanted to go out and eat in peace... I don't want to disturb you. I'll find another table. No, we are all for women's equality. Men are also fellow creatures. Sit down. Thanks. I have removed the bedspread. I am working nights this week. I am working at home today. which I do tonight. You are so diligent! Don't overdo it. - Maybe I'll go see Børge. - That's a good idea. He is so nice. He has lived here a week without any problems. Thanks. I was married for six months, but... almost half a year. Your marriage is in trouble, is it not, Rita? A man only wants to marry a woman so she'll sleep with him. I only did it to please him. I didn't need it a damn bit. It's abuse of trust. Yes, if you don't want to, you shouldn't have to. Listen, he's not the first damn man to have sex on the brain. Are we going to go to my home? It's cheaper to have a drink at home. - Cheers! - Sshh, we must be quiet. The landlady does not like me have visitors. Especially not ladies. Older people can not imagine a man and woman having a conversation, - without it being anything sexual. Then they're missing out. How delightful, my girl...! Congratulations. Yes, goodbye for now. - Kirsten has got a job. - It was about time! The same thing, every night. You sitting here with the Dannevirke assignments. These are useful tasks at the sergeant school. What does all this stand for? "Bed and bedside tables"? - Yes, uh it ... - Is it also military? Yes, it's the nursing room at that hospital - that was attacked in 1948... - Was there a nurse then? - Yes. Florence Nightingale... Do you know the story? The enemy attacks and shouts: "Kill all the men, rape all the women!" The nurses shout: "Spare our beloved matron!" Then, she shouts: "Quiet, girls! War is war!" Spare me your jokes! You asked about it. You can joke if you like. Men always want to joke, but sometimes it's not funny. You sound sensible. Why were you divorced? Because ... she wouldn't ... try something different ... ... something exciting. No mutual respect and a lot of inhibitions! - No orgasm? - Orgasm is overrated. - That's what it's about! - I has never had one. - Then, you should try. - If Rita doesn't want to, she shouldn't. How about a game of strip poker? Then we will see if you are really so liberated. Rita, are you afraid to get naked? No, and I can stop if I do not feel like it anymore. Of course. Then, lets clear the table. - I have not seen this until now. - Lovely. - You did not know it was there? - No, the landlady didn't mention it. She probably doesn't know anything about it. See, I had the bad luck! I'll take off the dress jacket. And now the last clothing. The moment of truth. You are a beautiful, Lily! Draw. Now it's just us, Rita. I see, now it is my turn. Stand up, just like Lily. Surely you have nothing to be ashamed of? I have an idea: The one who gets the highest card, must choose what he or she wants. - It was me. - What do you wish? - A cup of coffee. - Coffee?! Are you crazy? - Do you also want coffee? - No, thanks. I would like something else entirely. I want some. So, so, first coffee. - Thanks. - Here you go. Now, we play one more time. Can you guess what I want? - What about you, Rita? - I'm laying a solitaire. I think that it is rising up. (moan) Oh ...! (knock) (moan) - Oh, oh, oh, oh ... - Sshhh. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ... - Ssssshh! Mom is on the night shift this week. Thank you. - That is what I call an orgasm. - You've never tried that? Is that an orgasm? I came of course, as I usually do. Now it's my turn. Come on, both of them. (moan) Damn! There should be a large supply in here...! Here they are. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. The most important thing is to have complete silence. Yes, we must not make a sound. There is one problem: Toothpaste! What about Ultra-Brite? They say it has sex appeal. - I'm buying two tubes. - But use dark glasses and a beard. - Not to buy toothpaste. - One has to be careful. - When can we do it? - Between midnight and one AM. - Yes, but what day? - Wednesday. That is our evening. It doesn't happen every Saturday. We get martinis before dinner, red wine with food and cognac for coffee. And then we tend to fall asleep! But then ... Wednesday? Yes ... Yes, why not? Hello, Mr Hansen. - We have a new assistant for you. - Can he do anything? One cannot demand too much. She is a woman. This is your boss. This is Kirsten Sorensen. Hello, Kirsten. My name is Egon. Come, I will show you the dark room. Can you close the door? That was nice of you to invite me out. Say, I've had a fucking good day. The company gives me the addresses. If the customer buys the lamp, I get the payout. I have earned 1200 today. You must not laugh at me ... I dare not go to such places. It's silly of me. We're all like that.

Do you see the guy in the bar? It's his birthday... ... and I have promised him a fuck. - Are you interested? - (class) - What are you doing with my girl? - Absolutely nothing. - Is he bothering you, honey? - He's very kind. I only asked for the toilet. Talking to a nice lady about piss and shit! Fuck off! Do you see the guy in the bar? Sure. Why not? Dav, my name is Gerda. Happy Birthday. - It is not my birthday. - Not so modest. Can we have some more drinks? Yes, then it's me. (snoring) - Now look at the birthday boy! - I said that to get you. - You are a bit cheeky...! - I am crazy about you. What if he wakes up? I don't want someone watching. He won't wake up. Liquor is bad for sex. It arouses desire at the beginning. But later... ... It inhibits the ability. You certainly haven't drunk too much. You haven't either. (moan) Good morning. Food for the sluggard. Gerda! What the hell are you doing here? I just prettied the place up a little. And moved in some of my things. I intend to live here. - Are you not happy? - Are you out of your mind! My contract says I will be thrown out if I have someone stay. Get...! Don't say that. I waited until your landlady went to work. When she comes back you have to be gone ...! - You can 't talk to me like that. - I have to go to work! I have to go to work! I'm not coming back until you are gone...! You get me? Yes. Then goodbye for now. Kirsten is moving home to us. Isn't it nice? No! A grown woman should not live at home with her parents. - Nonsense, she's our only one. - Yes... I need some fresh air. Ah, hell! Svend, Svend, Svend! Svend, Svend, Svend! Something has happened! Our daughter will move back home. It is far too risky! - Give her sleeping pills. - So you can bowl my wife ?! - Hey, you have to fuck me too! - Hell! I have to think! - Yes, you have to find out. - Hell! Here is the sun you are longing for. You replied to our ad for high mountain soles. - Well, then I'm in. Come on in. - Thanks. - Yes, it's best in the bedroom. - It's in here. You set the tripod here. And if you throw away the clothes and lie down on the bed ... - Hey, don't get any ideas. - Pardon. But you have nothing to be ashamed of. Otherwise, you can wait until I'm gone. What about the payout? My husband is not here. He has the checkbook. Try it for a few days. Here is my card if you have problems. I'll try it out, but you have to leave first. I'm sure you will be satisfied. I'll let myself out. - Enjoy. - Thank you. - Can you pick up some 1-paper? - Yes. Oh like that! - Where did you find them? - Up in the bookshelf. A refined and beautiful girl like you should not see things like that. You are not too refined to photograph it. Who's the guy? Where did you get it? At home. He rents from my mother. - Do you know him? - No! I have dark room at home, so mistakes can happen. - Egon, you have to see the Director. - Yes, I'm coming now. Just go home, Kirsten, it's morning. - The expedition. - Can I have Egon's address? A delegation is coming from the East tomorrow. The picture of DZ 531 is so good - that it can be enlarged even more, right? Yes. I'm getting started now. I should finish that this evening. Good. Then, when it is ready ... ... leave it here. Now I am going home to prepare my speech. Good day. Here is the lamp you ordered. - Nice. Come on in. - Thank you. It's a mess here. The staff are off today - and my husband is not home. This way, please. I cannot not find the TV programme. - It's Wednesday, right? - Yes, it's Wednesday. - (door opens) - Here comes Kirsten. - Hi. - Hi. Well, have you recovered the retreat from Dannevirke? The lamp is hung here if this is where you want to disrobe and lie down... You start the quartz lamp by turning the knob here. At the beginning you have to put it in 1-2 minutes. After 14 days, you can increase the time by 5-10 minutes. You must read the brochure, so you get to know the filters. - It is best without clothing. - Such? Would you like to have a drink? Isn't it hot with all your clothes on? - You are seducing me, aren't you? - Who, me?! I need to go to the apartment this evening. I can sleep over there. Now I was just as happy you were here. Kirsten must do what she feels like. - Thank you, Dad, you understand me. - Yes. Hagbard, you must have your dessert. No, I just came to speak to the Colonel, you know. Your father has nothing else than work on his mind. Yes, yes, she's gone all night. Meet in the garden in a little while and set the time. - Now, the dessert. - Yes, Mr Colonel. - Dessert. - Over and out, Colonel! I'm just exercising. We'd better synchronize watches now. The time is 1912. Twelve minutes after seven. The exact time is 0022. It's 22 minutes past midnight. - I will see you here. Okay? - Okay! Arrrrrghhh! - What was that? - Your father has fallen down the hole! (phone ringing) Hansen. One moment. For you. Director Poulsen from the factory. It sounds like Sørensen. Well, director Poulsen ... He is an old military buddy. Yes, it's me. What do you mean, that the event has been canceled? No, it's just a sprain. You must put a bandage on your foot. Yes, Colonel. Everything is going according to plan. Hvabehar? ... Well, yes. Alright. Goodbye, Colonel. - Do we have an elastic bandage? - What's wrong with your foot? - I just mis-stepped. - In the medicine cabinet. Can I help? - What? No, I can take care of it myself. - You should do some sports. - (knock on door) - Come in. - Well, that's how you look. On this side. - Who are you? - My husband lives here. - He's done with you. Beat it! You must want his money. He's dead tired of you! - It is a lie! - You call me a liar? Ouch...! The relationship between people finds varied expressions - - in the cultural context, we here deal with, and ... Boring program. I am going to bed. Go ahead, my darling. I have to watch the rest of the news. The evolution from metaf ysik and subjectivism to objectivism ... It's boring. I am going to lie down. Go ahead. I have to watch the rest of the news. ... Gobineaux and Ghamvertin with their theories and hypotheses. They can not even empirically confirmed. The condition man comes to in when a decision is made ... - What is your actual name? - Gerda. My name is Kirsten. (parrot howl) My husband is coming. Good evening, young man. Thank you for caring for my wife so well. I haven't the energy for such a strenuous business. But I do not mind watching, if you are kind enough to continue. Well, so okay then. (giggling) Børge? - Is that you, Egon? - Do you know each other? - Only with clothes on. - We need to get this fixed quickly. - Come now and help me. - Yes. No, now do not be with it. - Is everything okay? - Yes, everything is calm and dark. We'd better swap watches. Like ... So it's happening. - Remember to take her on the butt. - Ball grip? Good luck. Remember and hump. 1 ... 2 ... 3. 4 ... 5 ... 6. 1 ... Oh, hell! ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ... Off, oh, off ...! Oh ... I had just fallen asleep, Hagbard. Can't this wait until Saturday? What are you doing, Hagbard? Are you crawling around on the floor? Stop the military nonsense. If you must have it your way, then do it, but hurry up. Do not pull on the duvet, Hagbard! I do not want to see anything. Hagbard ... oh ... what are you doing though? - (bang) - Uh, what was that ?! My new quartz lamp. ... Oh, it is broken. Well, Svend, you'll knock me over. Well, Svend, though! Well, Svend, though ... There is a lot mom has not told me about. Oh, Hagbard...! My little stallion...! Yes, Hagbard, oh, Hagbard! Hagbard, yes, Hagbard. Oh, Hagbard! (moan) Oh ... Nussebasse-Svend. - Everything went well? - Oh yes, though. - Such a lovely woman. - No details, please! - And you, are you satisfied? - About...! You could have told me about the lamp. - We do not have quartz lamp. - Yes, I knocked it over. She called me "little stallion," in her joy. No details! We must hope they never discover us. Good night. (revealing) Are you whining? Ouch...! Egon! It finally worked out, huh? And two ladies ... Kirsten! What are you doing here? - Enjoying life and freedom. - You can take a chance on him! - That's how you speak to a lady? - She is my wife! She was your wife. Hop up and join us. I'm dead tired. I have worked right up until now. I want to sleep. Worked? You have gone around and screwed everyone in sight! And that should come from you, who lies and ... You disappoint me! I learned things in one night, which you have not shown me. Because I respected you, yes. Who dialed mum, by the way? Typical of you with apologies. Come on, Egon, you never have to meddle in family showdowns. Where is the bathroom? We have just enough time before mother comes home. Mother...! - Well, goodbye, Børge. - Goodbye, Kirsten. Call if you would like to apologise. Me, apologise? When one is the fourth wheel on a wagon, it's best to get off. - No, stop it. Stop teasing me...! - You just have to wash. Do you do pictures here? No, but the big ones I have to to rinse down here. - It's naughty ... and well done. - My mother can't see it! - You are very good. - It is you. - Is it my ...?! - Yes. - What are you doing?! - I want the negative. - I have it at work. - Get it. Otherwise I will not go! - What if mom comes? - I'm going up to your room. - Let me in now! - First the negative! You can at least allow me to rinse off! SShh. What on earth ...? Why are you outside the bathroom, covered in soap? I heard the door, and then I just wanted to see ... You are stark naked. Are you drunk? No, I'm straight from work. I wanted to take a bath ... - I have to meet at 7.30. - Well, my diligent child. - I will go and clean up your room. - No! You can't! The films in there will be ruined. Well ... Then I will go to my room and go to sleep. - Sleep well, mother. - Bye for now. - Let me in now! - First the negative. You need eggs after that performance. Fried eggs today? I thought you might need it. - That was nice. - Yes it was! You were so manly, violent. You've never done that before. Until now, you have always been so considerate of me. - It was great! You just took me. - I'm glad you enjoyed it. - This is not the last time, is it? - Yes! ... No, of course not. Hagbard ... there's something I have to talk to you about. We've never talked much about sex, right? We are both self-conscious, aren't we? - Is there something wrong? - No, on the contrary. But what you did yesterday, have you never done before. It was so beautiful. I have become a completely different person. You have to do it again, right? Yes, yes ... yes. A large sirloin and a bottle of wine. I'm hurrying home, not because of the food, but you. You're in a hurry home, right? We're alone tonight. I'll probably hurry home. That you could ... and so with the bad foot. Well, it's much better. And this, gentlemen, is an enlargement of the DZ 531. (interpreter translates into Japanese) (talk and laughter) - What did he say? - It's the female genitalia. - What?! - Director, it's a pussy. I mixed up the negatives. But I have a sample image here. (interpreter translates) (Japanese are completely silent) It's all gone in the sink! You are dismissed! (Japanese language) - Yes, it went in the sink. - No, they are excited! And they want both pictures for marketing. Denmark has a high culture and know-how. - This is a million order! - Stay! You can't go. I will triple your salary, if you will only stay! - Well, you're here. - Sorry, I was a little late. I have to teach you to make duplicate negatives. Does it take a long time? I want a trip home to Børge to talk to him. Oh, the wrath of the lovers renews love. Is this the barracks? It is Svend Hansen. Is the Major H.P.M. Sorensen there? It is highly classified. You can't tell me anything about where the Major is? I'm just going to talk to him! Well, that's not possible. Yes, not even then. What has he done to her, though? - I saw it first! - I got it first! No, I did ... Is that you, Mrs Hansen? We almost quarrelled because I promised my husband beef. - He has sprained his right foot. - Mine has sprained his left foot. Isn't it funny? Now I will give him some delicious food. - Then keep it. - No! Because we are neighbours, we don't need to have the same fine meat. Here is another one just like it ... - Bon appetite. - Thank you. (snoring) Wake up now, Børge, it's late. I have food for you. (snoring) I do not want you living here, Gerda. Beat it! That's not how you talk to his wife. Is that you, Kirsten? - Yes, are you sorry? - No, on the contrary. - I've learned a lot. - I have too. One should not be afraid to try something new. In the middle of it all, I've missed you. I was so jealous yesterday. - It's because I love you. - Do you really think so? - Eat now. - Shall we not go home? - In your apartment ... if I may? - I do not really know. - Yes, I'm packing up again. - I have not unpacked yet. Go ahead, this is it. - Thank you, Egon. - What have you done? - I'm staying with you. - No, it's not possible. - Are you so scared of your mother? - No but... - No, it does not work. - Why not? - The bed is too narrow. - We're moving downstairs. It will be too crowded. - Borje has moved home to his wife. - I'm taking over the damn apartment! Truly, you don't listen to me even right in my face! Stop it! They must move immediately. - Egon ?! - Mother! I've grown up! And who is this woman, then? - It ... is my fiancé. - My name is Gerda. - Did you say fiancé? - Yes if you want to. Congratulations, my dear, dear children. Stop for a moment. Keep still until I have blessed you! - Can I help with anything? - Are you already undressed? - Then wait for me in the bedroom. - Yes, I will, darling. I'm going straight to the bathroom. - Svend, are you coming soon? - Yes. - What are you doing there? - Like yesterday, right? Hagbard, you devil! (humming) (scream) - What's wrong, my darling? - Kirsten must have dropped this picture. - It's our son-in-law! - But do you think it's Kirsten's? I have not seen her like that since I changed her diapers. Hagbard ... that's how you did yesterday. - Me? - No ... I mean the other way around. Shall we not come then in the can, little darling? No. I must know how Kirsten is doing. Kirsten, if you don't feel like it, then don't. Yes, you like it, and I like it. - Yes, if you insist ... - (phone ringing) - Ignore the call. - No, it could be mom and dad. - Yes? ... Mom, has anything happened? - No. - I wanted to see how it's going. - Børge has moved home! We are so excited. Fine. I was too shocked, when he wanted to ... You know ... But you should never be afraid of to try something new. You are right. Have you had anything to eat? We have loads of leftovers, so... Thanks, but we but we have food here ... Plenty ... Wonderful, my girl. Is he calling you? Yes, Børge ... Børge ... Børge ... Børge ... - You sound so distracted. - Børge ... now I'm coming. Hello? ... Oh, my God, she had to tend to her husband. - It's better than yesterday! - Yes, it is so! No, just like yesterday. You come crawling across the floor, and then under the duvet. Yes, yes, yes.
