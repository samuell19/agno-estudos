(UPBEAT MUSIC) (FILM REEL CLICKING) (GENTLE MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (SOLEMN MUSIC) JAMES: Last winter was brutal. MOM: This one's gonna be worse. I think I'm gonna get one of those snow blowers. Don't waste money of one of those. I'll just shovel. I like it. Yeah, me too. (CLANKING) We'll see. One thing I think we should invest in is a treadmill or something for the basement. It'll keep you moving. Keep us all moving. Yeah, be another thing to collect dust. Besides I do move, I do my walks. It's not enough. And how are you gonna lug that thing downstairs anyway? I'll just put a blanket on the stairs and boom, slide it right down. MOM: You can't slide a 500 pound treadmill down the stairs and hope for the best. They're not that heavy. I'll just bring it down by myself, if I have to. I'm gonna finish upstairs. (GENTLE MUSIC) (CLICKING) He had to ask too many questions. Which should have been told to a woman. It won't work out. I find it today. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey, Lye. Happy Friday. Hey Alessa. What's going on? LYLE: Nothing much. Yeah, just hanging out? Yeah. I saw how well your shots came out from the fall campaign. Uh, I don't know how happy I am with them. Don't play the humble card. You know they came out great. (SIGHS) Thanks. So you think Mark'll give you a bump up any time soon? Haven't really thought about it. I don't think I've tried that one. Oh, this, yeah they're pretty good. I like any of the ones that have like caramel in them. Or any of the other flavors that aren't too dry. Yeah, me too. Otherwise they get stuck to the roof of your mouth. - (CHUCKLES) - Ugh. Kinda could go for one of those right now actually. Where here, take mine. No, Lyle, I didn't... Shouldn't even be eating them anyway. Thanks, Lye. (GENTLE MUSIC) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Hey, Lyle, throw another one in? Fuck it. Yeah, why not, it's Friday. (DOOR SLAMS) (CHATTERING) MOM: Are you okay? Everything's fine. Just let me be. Tonight's not the night. Okay. So I was at the store today and there was this guy giving out free samples of this meat and the next thing I knew I had bought two cases. I hope it didn't cost a lot. We're definitely not in the place to get gypped on expensive meat. That's all I'm saying. Lyle, any plans tonight? Nothing really. James? I'll hit the gym after this and probably be out late. (CHAIR RATTLES) I wasn't finished. MOM: They're cold, you don't want these any more. James, why don't you and Lyle go to the gym together? Yeah, right. Why, maybe I wanna go? He slows me down. What? What? You said I slow you down. What does that mean I slow you down? It means I know where everything is and I don't feel like explaining to you where the machines are. No, I know what you meant. All right. All right. He's all sensitive again. Don't take it that way, Lyle. Why do you do that? Why don't we say anything any more? He's your oldest son, we have to start talking about it again. It's killing me. Stop. No. Let him go. It's just, your weight. We sit here every night and continue to watch you fall deeper and deeper down the hole. Do you wanna be 30 and not be able to look at yourself in the mirror? With every extra bite you take you fall further down. We know better than anybody. The world is moving faster and faster and it's not gonna slow down for you. And after what happened, there's no excuse for you to follow the same way. You wanna start feeling good again? 70% of feeling good is looking good. (SOLEMN MUSIC) (SIGHS) The beach. (THUDS) (KNOCKING) Yeah? (DOOR CREAKING) How we doing? Fine. (SIGHS) You know I remember when you and James were little. Before all of this and what happened. He looked up to you like you were his idol. Everything that you did, he wanted to do. Everywhere you went, he wanted to go. If you liked something, sure enough, so did he. Then it stopped. Yeah well, we grew up. I think he's trying to get that back. That time for both of you. It's getting late, mom. (FLOOR CREAKING) (SOLEMN MUSIC) (DOOR BANGS) (MOANS) (SIGHS) (GENTLE MUSIC) So you treated people like me before? Sure. And you've helped them? I'm just a guide. It's really up to the person. However long that might take. The kinda money this stuff costs, I hoped you be able to fix me in a day. What is it that you want fixed? Have you been big all your life? And your family? No, not really. And I take it, they been giving you a hard time about it? I get what people want out of me, (SOLEMN MUSIC) but I can't stop. The usual? (CHATTERING) LYLE: I wish I could stop, but I can't. Those few minutes where I feel this rush, satisfaction and then it's gone. (RADIO CHATTERING) You know food is a wonderful thing. It's a joy to many, including myself. It's just it's something that can very easily get the best of you. Then why do I look like this and you don't? Control. It's something you'll learn to work on. It's something I even need to work on. See these? Now these satisfy me. In fact, I'm gonna have one the second you leave because I can't wait long enough to even get outside to do it. This. This is just a shitty reminder of that. We all have our habits, Lyle. The things that satisfy us to get us through our day. (KNOCKING) (DOOR CLATTERS) There he is. All right. You wanna, uh, get the coaster? (TV CHATTERING) So. What's up with you? Not much. Oh, you know I met this girl at my cousin's wedding. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. Have you been seeing her a lot? I give her my number, so waiting for her to call. You look good though, man. I mean did you lose any weight? It's probably just the shirt or something. You know there's stuff you could do, like you could diet, exercise. Yeah, you know a lot of people have been bringing that up lately and ah, it's just not as easy as you think it is. At least not for me. (TV CHATTERS) It will get easier. Yeah. All right. This place is amazing. How do you even afford this? (SIGHS) Yeah, I don't. (LAUGHS) I don't know if you ever met my old roommate, Ryan, but he moved out, now I'm left pulling the slack. TV's sick. Yeah, ah, again, that's Ryan. It's um... You know we're still paying it down and it's really, it's really expensive. You still do that thing with your knuckles? Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to stop. Well, it'll get easier. Well played. (BARROOM CHATTERING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) Any time you're ready to start socializing, I'm in. Do you mind if we get out of here? I'm kinda tired. Yeah, I'm gonna go take a piss. I'll be back in an hour. WOMAN: Woo. No way. Alessa. Lyle, what are you doing here? I know. Wow, it's so nice to see you outside of the office. You look great. You, too. It's so weird, I never see anyone from work out. Me neither. MAN: Ooh, thanks. You been here a while? Uh, about an hour. We just got here. You gonna stick around? Yeah, yeah, definitely. Let me just get my jacket. WOMAN: Who's the fat guy? ALESSA: Just some guy from work. Excuse me. Hey, who was that girl? Let's go. KEITH: What? LYLE: Excuse me. - (THUDS) - Watch it, buddy. (RUMBLING) (SOLEMN MUSIC) (SIGHS) (LYLE'S STOMACH RUMBLING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey. Hey. JAMES: Where have you been? (SIGHS) Busy. (SIGHS) See you later. Where you going? LYLE: Shopping. (CART RATTLING) (CHATTERING) (CONVEYOR BELT WHIRRING) (BEEPING) (CELL PHONE PULSING) (SOLEMN MUSIC) (SIGHS) (POUNDING) Okay. (CLICKING) (SIZZLING) (BEEPING) (GENTLE MUSIC) (CLICKING) (SIZZLING) (MICROWAVE BEEPING) Lyle. I'm sorry, I fell asleep on the train. (MOUSE CLICKING) Whatever. (MICROWAVE HUMMING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey. Hey. What happened to you the other night? I lost you. Yeah, sorry, I left. Suddenly I didn't care to be there any more. (MICROWAVE BEEPING) Oh. What you got there? Grilled chicken, mixed veggies, side of brown rice. Nice. Yeah. Well it was really nice seeing you. Maybe next time we could get the whole company to go out. All get drinks together. (SIGHS) I don't know. I'm trying to cut back on drinking for a bit. Wanna get in shape. Really? Yeah. (GENTLE MUSIC) (PANTING) There's more you can eat than just grilled chicken, you know? Yeah well, this has been proven to be the best lean meat for losing weight. I think you look great. I can already see a difference. Okay, can we change the subject? Let's talk about something else. Definitely. So did anything big happen today? You guys really can't think of anything else to talk about? James, did you get a chance to pick up the computer? Yeah, like two weeks ago. Oh, good. Lyle, um, work's going okay? Yeah. (SIGHS) You can just leave your plate for me. LYLE: No, I got it. (GENTLE MUSIC) (CELL PHONE BEEPING) (PANTING) (SIZZLING) (CHATTERING) (FRANTIC MUSIC) (WIND HOWLING) (PANTING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SOLEMN MUSIC) You look tired. I am. DR. TAYLOR: How much sleep are you getting? Eight hours a week. That's about right. (SIGHS) It's hard. DR. TAYLOR: Then maybe you should slow down a bit. I can't. You can't? My whole life people have been telling me lose weight, get in shape and when I'm finally doing it and it's working, am I suppose to slow down? I'm not saying you don't have my support. Just be smart about it. (LYLE SIGHS) You know I've always had this one recurring dream. The type of dream you wake up nervous from. Makes it hard to fall asleep after. I'm at my table, I think it's my dining room, and I'm about to eat dinner and as I go to take a bite, I look up and there's an owl perched up on the counter above me. Just sitting there, staring at me with these vicious angry eyes. And I look down to my plate, but I could still feel the owl just staring right through me. Watching me eat. Funny thing is I haven't had that dream all week. Be smart about it. This is the smartest thing I've ever done. (SIGHS) (FAINT CHATTERING) (CELL PHONE PULSING) (SNIFFLES) (GENTLE MUSIC) So what do you do? I work in advertising. I do photo editing for a lot of client photography. Oh, so you make people look fake? (CHATTERING) Yeah, pretty much that's what I do. And why aren't you drinking? Yeah, Lye, why aren't you drinking? Michelle and I wanna know. Just trying to cut back a little bit. Oh, come on, loosen up. Why don't you get him something to drink? Yeah. (CHATTERING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) Yeah, so Lyle and I played Little League together. I'm on one team, he's on the other and it's the championship game. Please don't. Oh, come on, please. Yeah, come on. Fine, tell it. Okay, I'm at bat and he's in right field. You're in right field. Yeah, the place where there's no action. I think I was only there because legally they needed to play me a certain amount of games... Let me tell 'em. So it's a bright and sunny day and I'm up at bat, but like look, I'm terrible, okay? So it's like I have like two strikes against me, anyway out of nowhere I just like hit this ball. I knocked it straight in the right field, right at Lyle and I'm rounding 1st base, I'm like there's no way this guy doesn't catch it. I just remember seeing him like scurrying around, huffing and puffing (LAUGHS). And then out of nowhere it just comes down and hits him right on top of the head. Knocked him out, he looked like just a loser. (LAUGHING) Oh my god. I just remember seeing you like, laying out on the grass for three minutes. (LAUGHING) Uh, should we get some food? WOMAN: Yeah, I'm starving. (ENERGETIC MUSIC) (GENTLE MUSIC) ♪ I feel so fine ♪ ♪ I've been through hard times ♪ (SIGHS) Need any menus? Nah, I'm gonna have a burger, ah, medium with fries. Yeah, it's a cheat day. More like a cheat week. I'll have the same. Um, I'll have a chicken fingers with honey mustard. And for you? I'm good, thanks. What? He'll have grilled cheese with bacon and fries. Stop. What? It's a late night favorite of yours, you're fine.

That's cool, so maybe I can text you sometime? (LAUGHS) Thing is, sorry Lyle, I actually have a boyfriend. Oh, okay. Yeah, um, I mean I think you're a great guy. I just don't think it's the right thing to do. Yeah, of course, right. Well, it was really nice meeting you two. You, too. (ENGINE RUMBLING) (CAR DOOR SLAMS) So, glad you came out, right? She didn't have a boyfriend. (SIZZLING) (SIGHS) Fuck. (SIZZLING) Hungry? (SIGHS) Why did you make me eat that shit last night? I didn't make you do anything. This ruins everything. I think you're overreacting a bit. No, I didn't wanna eat or drink anything, you made me do both. Come on, man, you know what I'm trying to do. Yeah, I just don't think a grilled cheese is gonna ruin everything. (SIGHS) I gotta go. (SOLEMN MUSIC) (DOOR SLAMS) (PANTING) (SCALES CLANKING) Fuck. (CLANKING) (SIZZLING) (LYLE'S STOMACH RUMBLING) Can I help you with anything? Uh, yeah, are you Cynthia? Yeah, I am. Hey, I'm Lyle Bennett, James' brother. Oh I didn't know James had a brother. Yeah, he does. So are you looking for anything specific? Yeah, I'm looking for something to help me get in better shape. Okay. Oh this is our um, digestive enzyme, you can take a look at that. This is our Green Coffee Bean Extract, that one's really popular. And also, oh, our um, Raspberry Ketone. This one helps you speed up your metabolism. How's it taste? They taste pretty good. (SIGHS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (KNOCKING) CO-WORKER: Hey, Lye. Hey, what's up? Nothing, uh, Mark told me to tell you to go see him. (SIGHS) Why? CO-WORKER: I don't know. Okay. (BEEPING) What is going on with you? I'm sorry, Mark. I've been having trouble sleeping these last two weeks. I can see that, you've been falling asleep at your desk. It's this diet I'm on. I really can't fall asleep. It's no excuse though. It'll stop, I promise. You shouldn't be starving yourself. I'm not. It's just something I gotta get used to. But whatever you do outside of work, that has to stay outside of work. I mean you've been with us for over five years. You've never handed anything short of spectacular. I don't want that to change. (THUMPING) (MACHINES PURRING) (CHATTERING) (BEEPS) (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hey. Oh hey. (SIGHS) You all finished? Yeah, why? (SIGHS) I wanted to know if you wanted to lift with me. I can show you a few things. No, I'm good. JAMES: No, you're doing it wrong. Straighten your wrists. I'm trying. Hold on. (GRUNTS) I'll show you again. (LYLE SIGHS) See. Straighten your wrists, so you don't snap 'em off. And then just push out. (WEIGHTS CLANGING) All right? Come on. Get down there, do it again. No, I'm good, I got it. No, you don't got it. Get down and do it again. James, I got it. Do it. LYLE: (sighs) All right. Straighten your wrists. (LYLE GROANS) You gotta learn to... Fuck man. I told you I was done. What are you doing? Calm down. Look, from now on just let me be. (WATER SPLASHING) (GENTLE MUSIC) What is that? A vitamin. Did something happen? No. Another plate, huh? Yeah. How about that? Not a word from you. What do you mean? It's funny, I can't remember you saying anything to James about taking another plate, only me. Don't be crazy. Of course, I did. No, there's just certain things I can't help but remember and that's one of them. What's wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. In fact, I've never been better. Exactly what you guys wanted. So I guess I have you to thank. I'm confused. Were you planning on ending up like dad? Should we just not have said anything and let it happen? Yeah, well his weight wasn't the only problem. Please, keep telling yourself that. Shut up. (SIGHS) I can't live here any more. (SOLEMN MUSIC) (PANTING) (BUZZING) (CLANGING) (SIGHS) I gotta get in there. I'm late. (EXHALES) You gonna do some job hunting today? Yeah, maybe later on. You've been saying that for three months. Yeah, but this time's for real. I've already got my laptop set up. I'll believe it when I see it. What's wrong with enjoying an extended vacation? Oh, is that what they call gettin' fired nowadays? Have fun in your cube. Would you just wash the dishes, please. LYLE: Yeah, yeah. (DOOR SLAMS) (SIZZLING) (SOLEMN MUSIC) (SIGHS) DR. TAYLOR: So you're five pounds away? Yeah. You look happy. Thanks. DR. TAYLOR: But are you? What? Happy. I'm at a point now, where I'm seeing things a lot clearer. (SIGHS) But are you happy, Lyle? Yes. I'm the happiest I've been in a long time. Talked to your family? James every now and then. My mom and I have been texting more than calling. I don't think she's ever gonna bounce back. DR. TAYLOR: From what? LYLE: Me. My dad. It's a lot. DR. TAYLOR: Do you think about your dad a lot? LYLE: Sometimes. DR. TAYLOR: You wanna talk about it? LYLE: No. DR. TAYLOR: Why? Because there's nothing to say. But don't you think if you talk about it... I can't. I just can't. Okay. How's work? Is your manager still... Work's fine. I've got a lot more energy there now. I can put up with a lot more. It's great. Life is pretty great. (MACHINES RUMBLING) (THUMPING) (CLANGING) Nice hair cut. You like it? It fits you. So you come here now, too? I got one of those free passes for the week. And you? Been here a couple of months. It's good to switch things up, you know. It's an expensive switch. How's the house? Quiet. How's your place? Great. How come you don't stop by? I haven't been invited. (CHATTERING) Mom's doing good? Yeah, she's keeping herself busy. Yeah, with what? Moving on. Think she's looking to sell the house. I think she's talking to some people about it. Really? When? JAMES: Soon, I'm guessing. Well that's a good thing, I think. Yeah, not much left there any way. What about you? What are you gonna do? Glad you're doing well. You feel good? Yeah. 70% of feeling good is looking good. Right? I'll see you around. (SOLEMN MUSIC) Four. (CLICKING) (SIZZLING) (WATER SPLASHING) KEITH: I saw a beautiful girl on the train today. Yeah. Yeah. (TV CHATTERING) I sat next to her, we got to talking. I don't get how you can do that. KEITH: What? Just sit next to somebody and start talking. I mean what do I have to lose? I guess. Anyway, she's engaged. LYLE: Really? Yeah. I didn't see a ring on her finger, though. So she probably just forgot to wear it or something today. (SIGHS) Yeah, I'm sure that's it. (EXHALES) Can you not put your feet on the table? I eat there, man. Okay. Who's that? It's a girl I used to work with. Is this the girl from that bar that one night? Yeah. KEITH: Is she single? Yeah. KEITH: Is she cool? She's... Yeah. KEITH: So why haven't you asked her out yet? I mean I only really knew her when I was bigger and I don't know, just never did. So why not now? Nah. KEITH: Why not? You're not big any more. Yeah, but... Lyle, what do you have to lose? Another time. (SIGHS) (SOLEMN MUSIC) (SIGHS) (KEYBOARD CLICKING) (EXHALES) (SIGHS) (COMPUTER BEEPS) (KEYBOARD CLICKING) (WAVES CRASHING) (SEAGULLS CHIRPING) (SIZZLING) You want some? No, I'm not hungry. I'll see you later. You know, you don't need any more of this stuff. Hopefully, this is it. 73.48. Whoa, the price went up? Yeah, apparently. Uh, okay, that's fine. So how's James doing? Uh, great. Thanks. See ya. (DOOR CREAKING) (DOOR SLAMS) (MACHINES HUMMING) (FAINT MUSIC) (BEEPS) (BEEPING) (PANTING) (GROANS) (THUDS) (MOANS) (CHATTERING) Okay. (DOOR BANGS SHUT) (TV CHATTERING) Again with the feet? What happened to you? It's nothing. Are you almost at 203? I'm three pounds away. Is losing three pounds really gonna make that much of a difference? Well, what do I know? I'm going out with Alessa this weekend. I figured what do I have to lose? You can thank me later. Are you hungry? Nope. (CRINKLING) DR. TAYLOR: I gave up smoking. Really? I made a promise to my daughter. Hmm. So what now? You gonna start chewing the gum or mints or those electric ones they have now? No. Nothing? Nothing. My dad used to smoke. Did he? Yeah. I always wanted him to stop, but I knew how much he enjoyed them, so I didn't bother him about it. In hindsight, I wish I had looked out for him more. Kinda the way you're family wanted to look out for you. My family used to order a pizza and then tell me I should eat better. I don't consider that looking out for me. I think that's enabling. What's done is done. I'm more focused on what's ahead. Okay, what's ahead? I don't think I'm gonna be able to see you any more, Dr. Taylor. Its just not the best time for me right now. Financially, my rent comes first, you know? But that's okay 'cause I feel like I'm in a place now where I can move forward. I look better, I feel better. Things are lining up for me at work. Really, this has been great. I can't thank you enough. You're a good man. Now, if that's the way you feel about it, I can't stop you. It is, it truly is. I just wanna ask... No. I just need to ask, is it... Is everything... (SIGHS) Is it all just a facade, Lyle? (SOLEMN MUSIC) It's been a pleasure. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SIGHS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (KEYS JINGLING) (CAR CRANKING) (LYLE'S STOMACH RUMBLING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (SNIFFS) (LYLE'S STOMACH RUMBLING) (CLATTERING) (KNOCKING) Hey, Ronnie needs the rent. (SIGHS) I don't have it right now. What do you mean? (SIGHS) I need you to spot me, just for now. I'll pay you back tomorrow. Whoa, Lyle, I can't spot you. Just for today? Then I, I need it tomorrow, I'm serious. Okay. Really. Okay, I said. I'm stressing. (EXHALES) (SIGHS) (INHALING AND EXHALING DEEPLY) (SOLEMN MUSIC) (POUNDING) (PANTING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CHATTERING) (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) (DOOR CREAKING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - Hey. - Hey. (LAUGHS) Aw, you gotta a table. Yeah, right? I just figured we were gonna be at the bar area. WAITRESS: Did you wanna a drink? Oh. Um, well whatever's light on tap is fine. Okay. Still nothing for you? Uh, yeah, I'll just stick with this. Really, Lyle, you sure? Yeah, I'm still recovering from last night. Oh. WAITRESS: Any food? You wanna like split a plate of nachos or something? Ah, no, I'm good. I guess I'll just stick with beer then. WAITRESS: Okay. Really, Lyle, just water? I'm still kinda on this diet thing. Oh, see now it all makes sense. Yeah. Why are you on a diet when you look so great? It's just a couple more pounds. How much have you lost? Close to 80. Whoa. (LAUGHS) 80, wow, oh my gosh. How hard was it? Uh, it was a breeze. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Why thanks. So how are you, Lyle? I'm good, I'm great actually. Yeah, how's sales? Sales? Your sales job. That's why you're not working with us any more, right? Yeah, right, right. It's good, I really like it there. It's something that allows me to really communicate with a lot of different people and um, you know that helps the day go by quicker, which is good. Wow, look at you. How 'bout you? I love where I'm at. Oh, you're good at what you do. Well, thank you. I take pride in that. I wish I could love the job like that. Hey, let's not get carried away. I don't love my job, I just, I love where I'm at, you know? I can't tell you how much I love coming home at the end of the day to my couch watching some bad TV. (LAUGHS) I mean seriously nothing makes me happier, I look forward to it all day. So you're content? Yeah. What about you? Almost. (LAUGHS) Well, it was really nice to see you, Lyle. I can't tell you how nice it is to see you. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Whatever you're doing, keep doing it. You look great. Thanks, I will. (LAUGHS) We'll talk soon. LYLE: All right. Night. (KEYS JINGLING) You know I was thinking um, I'd love to go out again next week, if you're free. Oh. I could look up a nice restaurant or we could see a movie. Lyle. I'm, (SIGHS) I'm just, I'm not, I'm not really looking for that right now. You know? I mean like with anyone. I, I hope you didn't think that tonight was like... No, no. I just thought we were catching up. Right. I'm really sorry if I gave you that impression or made you think it was something more. No, no, it's okay, it's my fault. I think we're probably better off just as friends, right? Yeah. Yeah. (SIGHS) Actually no, that's a lie. Look, I just, I need to know. You think there'll ever be a chance of anything between us? Lyle. No, no, it's okay. (SOLEMN MUSIC) (RUMBLING) (ENGINE REVVING) (TV CHATTERING) (DOOR CLANGING) (DOOR SLAMS) How did it go? (DOOR CREAKING) (DOOR SLAMS) How did it go? How'd it go? The last thing I should have ever done is listen to you. - What? - I knew I wasn't ready to go out with her. You know, you gotta learn to mind your own business sometimes. Why are you coming at me right now? All I did was push you to make a move on a girl. And I wasn't ready. When will you ever be ready? Just do me a favor and get out of my room, please. You're not making any sense. Keith, get out of my room. Lyle, I was just trying... Keith, get the fuck out of my room! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (THUMPING) (CLANGING) (SOFT MUSIC) CYNTHIA: Back already? Yeah. What's up? Looking for something new. Something new? Okay. Let's take a look. To tell you truth I feel like you've tried everything. Maybe we can do a fat burner or... I'll be honest. I'm not looking for something new. I actually just came here to ask you out. Oh. What? You have a boyfriend? Or is it not the right time? Which one? No. - I think... - Think what? That I'm a nice guy, but you don't have those feelings for me. You don't see me in that way. Which is it? Lyle, I think you better go. (SOLEMN MUSIC) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MACHINES RUMBLING) (BEEPING) (THUMPING) (BEEPING) (PANTING) (GROANS) (GAGGING) (PANTING) MAN: You okay, buddy? Yeah. (WATER GUSHING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (CHATTERING) One more. (SOLEMN MUSIC) (DOOR CLATTERS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey. Hey. What are you doing? (SIGHS) Just checking to see if I got any matches. Matches? Yeah, I made a profile on this single's website. Well, do you have any? Uh. No. I had to leave the gym. I don't have the money for it. I don't have the money for that. I don't have the money for this. Ah, Lye, I can't really afford to... I know. So what are you gonna do? (SIGHS) I don't know. Lyle, I've always been amazed at everything you've been able to get through. You've been through so much. You'll be fine. I'll always be here for you, man. Well, maybe not here. (SIGHS) You know what I mean. (SOLEMN MUSIC) (GROANING) (GRUNTS) Feel weird to be back? Yeah. All right. (THUDDING) (SILVERWARE CLANKING) MOM: It's the way you like it, right? Yeah, thank you. I don't really like how the potatoes came out. They're fine. Mm, yeah, they're great. The chicken is so dry. Mom, it's fine. We got that treadmill, you know? What? We got a treadmill a few months ago. Brandon's family was throwing it out, so yeah. It's in the basement if you ever wanna... Yeah and he didn't kill anyone getting it down there. It's weird having you back. Yeah. So it's really happening. You're doing it. Yeah. I think I'm ready to, you know, get some place smaller. Especially since both of you will be out of here soon. Yeah, I was thinking about starting to look for something of my own. That's good. I was actually thinking maybe, if you wanna, um, we could look to get something together. I wouldn't bother you much or anything. Could be good. Yeah. Definitely. JAMES: I miss him. MOM: Yeah. (SIGHS) I'm gonna have this later. (SIGHS) (SOLEMN MUSIC) (SIGHS) (FLOOR CREAKING) It's great though. Thank you. (GENTLE MUSIC) (CLICKS) One more.
