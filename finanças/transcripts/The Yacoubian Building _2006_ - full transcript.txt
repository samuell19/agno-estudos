You're a cheap rascal This means you've gone to him We'll talk again Enough, Hajj l won't take much of your time l know you're very busy And l'm at your service l don't want you to be upset with me because of the past 2 weeks l didn't have any free time to see you l understand, Pasha What do you want, Hajj? l'm sure you checked me out when you heard l wanted to meet you and all l found out is good, you're a stand up man Thanks be to God Everything comes from God Listen, Pasha... l want to contribute to the service of the country and the service of the people where l have my businesses and where there are people l've lived amongst and loved We're all like you, Hajj but as they say, to each his way of doing things l've prayed and consulted God almighty and l thought l'd nominate myself to the parliament... for the Kassr Elnile district - Kassr Elnile? - Yes, they're my people Do you know what we call that district in the parliament? The piece of cake Could you explain to me? Explain what? l said ''the piece of cake'' meaning that it's sweet lt has no problems, no low income neighborhoods no one to keep asking for things or the young people asking for apartments or jobs... until they make you hate your life and get hypertension - Where did you say you were from? - From upper Egypt Why don't you look for a sweet district in upper Egypt? l haven't been there for a long time, and no one knows me there - but in Kassr Elnile... - Listen... there are people who have asked for that district they've only asked, which means there's room for negotiations - Give me some time to think - Good deeds should be expedited lt's a million, Kamal Pasha, right? Yes, but what do you think of the drawing? The drawing is very beautiful but it's a lot of money this money is not for me it goes to several people as for me, well, l have enough money l know, Pasha l want you to know who was asking for that district - Who? - Abu Rihab, you know him? - Owner of Rida Welnour stores? - Right He's with the Moslem Brotherhood, and you know that and you're not on good terms with them, how will you accept him? When he runs for parliament, no one can say no to him that's democracy - and we're a democratic country - Yes But if he runs he might win he's blowing the market, selling for half the price, and less he has so money he can buy votes Nomination is easy Anyone who wants to run, let him run, no one will stop him but how he can win? That's our game not by forgery, God forbid but you can say we've studied the psyche of the Egyptians the people are holding on to the government... as if it were their mother even if this government does whatever it wants this is our job l know, but this the first time we do business together forget the million, for my sake, make it half a million Listen, Hajj... l only know how to draw two things either a million... or a billion what do you say? l agree, let's recite the ''Opening'' ln the name of God most gracious Praise be to God... Master of the day of Judgment You alone we worship... The money has to be here next week, in cash of those whom You blessed, not of those who have deserved wrath... - Amen - Congratulations, Hajj Why is this wine white and that other one red, Hatem? When we eat fish, we drink white wine Then, the red one is for meat How smart you are! Bravo - But why is all of this? - We're celebrating Celebrating what? Everyone who finishes his tour of duty goes home quietly No, we're celebrating your working full-time also, the second surprise... is that you won't go back to your hometown How? What about my son and my wife? They'll come live with you here l found you an apartment, and in the same building there's a room on the roof whose owner left and went home and l rented it right away, for your wife and son... Cheers - What? - Cheers Cheers - Cheers - Cheers Cheers, Hatouma lt's not like you think, Zaki Pasha l mean, the reciprocal cases... between you and your sister, won't be solved quickly she's filed an incompetence case against you... and that will take years to be over and you've filed a case to prove your right in the apartment and this might take a year or two Could that be, Mr Fekry? Mrs Christine... this is our country and we know it well - What can l do, then, counselor? - l'll tell you but don't say that l suggested this some hoodlums some hoodlums who can break into the apartment in any way either by breaking down the door or a wall the point is they should occupy it... and then you go in... and live in it normally of course, she'll file a lawsuit which will take the courts forever to come to a ruling she could die before they ever rule on it - ls there no other solution? - That's the only solution - l can't do that - But your sister is evil she is very evil We are the siblings of Abdela'al Pasha, we don't that to each other But you're the victim Even if l am the victim Dawlat is my sister and l have to put up with her and anyway, l'm not out on the street - Where's my coat? - Where to, Zaki Pasha? Zaki Zaki Zaki, l've never seen you like this and l've never seen you neglect yourself like this, what is it? Why didn't l get married? l could have had children and they would have definitely changed my life of course, you'll say that you were available to me but what can say about stupidity? l was afraid l'd marry you and then cheat on you l'm weak in front of any whim and then you would have hated me and that's the one thing l could never bear No, l would have forgiven you That's what you think My problem is that there were important things in front of me and l didn't see them or l saw them after it was too late - l'm going to go - l'll take you l've never hurt anyone l've only hurt myself even the women l slept with, they were all consenting they used to come into my house and then leave very happy that's why God will be very merciful with me He'll give me the greatest discount... You are forgiving... and merciful - How are you, Buthaina? - What's up? A great day, God willing... and by the blessing of the Virgin Mary full of grace - What's your problem, man? - ls that how you greet people? There's no need to frown, your secret is safe - l have no secrets - OK, you have no secrets but l owe you a favor for the sake of being neighbors and your nice mother What do you want? - How much does Talal pay a month? - 250 pounds Because you're stupid, l swear what l'm saying is no joke l have a job for you for 600 a month a very respectable job and if it's not, you'll make it respectable Our leaders claim... that they rule us by the laws of lslamic Shari'a... and that they implement democracy and God knows that they're lying on both counts lslamic Shari'a is suspended in our afflicted country and the government earns from gambling... and selling alcohol... and fornicating tourists and what's worse... is that the government turns this money into employee salaries and thus feeding its people from illicit money... and makes them perpetrators of the proscribed and then the curse of the proscribed plagues us l'm saying it clearly and directly... and without any ambiguity we don't want our nation to be democratic... nor secular nor socialist we want it to be lslamic lslamic... lslamic lslamic... lslamic lslamic... lslamic lslamic... lslamic lslamic... lslamic - Peace be upon you - and you How are you, Buthaina?

The veil before the check l wish you'd spend one night here so l can feel like l'm you wife, like other married women Smarten up, Suad, ours is not common law marriage l married you according to lslamic law also, spending the night is not important it's not the proof of love - What are you doing? - Shining your shoe No, shining shoes is a science let me... look...
