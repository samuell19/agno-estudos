Morning. Sean. Hey. How's it going, buddy? Yeah, it came through. Well, 'cause I know you like your offers for breakfast. Yeah, it's 2.5, 5% on the back end. Yeah. Will do. Hey, did you pick up my suit? It's next to your tux. I... Emma. Hey! How was Belize? Yeah? ♪ This is your good morning song ♪ ♪ It will last, all day long No. I promise, it's Saturday! Almost. Tomorrow. And you'll be waking up at Cade's. Yes! And I get to go straight home with him, too, after school, right? Mm-hmm. You're his MVP. Go get dressed. Of course, you know you're mine too. You could stay here instead. Make popcorn, cuddle, watch Star Wars Episode 27. Mom, I'm ten. Can I have cereal? Sure. Wow. Where's Lupe? Ensenada. Visiting her mother. OK. Hurry up, Sawyer. I'm going to be late. Oh, no. I'm taking him today. Like that? Really? I don't have to get out of the car. No. I said I'm taking him. Get dressed. You have pilates at nine. I like taking him. And I told Cade's mom I'd meet her to hand off the gift. OK. I know Cade's mom. Sawyer, come on, seriously! Buddy, let's do this. I've got a flight! Wait. Where are you going? The Tony's. Rose, I told you this. Wait, they're Sunday. Who are the Tony's? It's an award ceremony in New York. Daddy's client was nominated for a play she did. It's a whole weekend, Rose. It's like the Oscars. There's parties, there's press. I just didn't realize that you had to be there. Rose, I'm her agent! It is okay. I just didn't know. Can you please transfer some money to my account? I have that hair appointment this afternoon. I'll call Christophe and take care of it. I checked your account. You have enough to get you through the weekend. Have fun, honey. Brush your teeth, and if you get lonely or scared or anything... Mom. I know. You're ten. My perfect ten. ...to the sky. Lift up and 3... 2... 1... lower down to the ground. Wonderful job, everyone! Alright... Hi, Rick. Rose! I need you. Go to the club today at noon. Garden patio, okay? I want you to wear that flowered halter tieback piece. Gary says, "A couple of the partners' wives are having lunch." They know you're coming. Now, I want you to see if Cliff's wife comes. If she says anything about him buying in. No, Rick. I can't. You can't? Why? Why not? You know that I hate those things. Rose. I need this information. It will affect whether I make partner. Well, I-I have to take Sawyer's P.E. clothes. No, screw... screw Sawyer's P.E. clothes, OK? I need you to do this. How is me glugging down Prosecco and butter lettuce going to make you partner? Okay, you know what? You're right, you're right. I'm sorry to interrupt the convenience that I buy you. Why don't you just go back to reading your magazines or whatever it is that you do, OK? China will own half of Wilshire by the end of the year. I promise you. Confucius say, "Not a bad thing when they're funding half your kale habit." Gary. Nice to see you. Ah, it's always nice to be seen. Darling, spare key. Oh, are you guys sharing a car now? That's so cute. - They're sharing a car. - No, no. It's more like trading it in. This one's already five days old. Is it five? I thought it was six. It's a new model release. That's it, I'm staying off Mulholland. Victoria. Why can't one of your five assistants handle this? Because they're busy assisting me, darling. - Need a light, boss? - Nope. I quit. It's bad for you. - But, this is good for you. - Gary, don't! Darling, please! This is L.A. No one will miss it. It's like he owns the place. He practically has an address here. And he's too lazy to drive the forty-five minutes home even though he loves his cars. Rose, you've met Gary, right? Oh, of course. I thought you were heading to New York with Rick. We have an event tonight, but I'm scooting out there tomorrow. Ladies, always nice to see you. And I was just noticing, you in the floral and you in the modern. If you switched, much better. - Just an opinion. - Oh, Gary! Just an opinion, darling! Vicki, you know me. And, oh! Dessert. On me. On us? On us! Stop it. Keys are at valet? Okay bye, darling. Bye, girls. - Bye, Gary. - Bye. God. Such a comedian. Oh, I gotta take this. Dierdre, Hi. Why not? Dierdre, they're depending on you. No, I'll let... I'm going to handle it. Okay? Did I call it or did I call it... Well. I mean, once a quitter... She walked off that sitcom on Season two. She was only a recurring... Dierdra Banks? Cliff's wife? Yeah, she signed up to teach the Life Skills course at New Haven which is a women's shelter the agency sponsors, and now she's claiming she's "out of her league"... Hi, Nancy. Hello, darling. How are you? The Tonys. Oh. Yeah. No, have the best time. Nancy, I'm sorry, I can't... I can't hear you. I think we're having a bad connection. I'll get back to you. Hey, wait a minute. Weren't you like, Miss Colorado, or something? Arizona. I was Miss Arizona. Oh, that's right! Gary was saying that. So what was your cause? My cause? Do you mean my platform? Oh, well I spoke to teen girls on making your presence a present. Can probably work with that. What's your day like? ♪ Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na ♪ ♪ Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na ♪ ♪ I guess I just lost my husband, ♪ ♪ I don't know where he went ♪ So I'm gonna drink my money, ♪ I'm not gonna pay his rent ♪ ♪ I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight ♪ ♪ I wanna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight ♪ ♪ Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight ♪ ♪ Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight ♪ ♪ So, so what? I'm still a rockstar ♪ ♪ I got my rock moves and I don't need you ♪ ♪ And guess what? I'm havin' more fun ♪ Rick made me go to this lunch, and one of the wives there asked if I could teach a class to women from a shelter. She gave me an address downtown. It's probably like a hotel ballroom or something. Apparently, they like topics like self-esteem, job skills, professional wardrobing. So, I pulled out my crown and sash! I don't know if it goes well, maybe, maybe I could go back. You know maybe this... this could be my thing. Anyway, I just, I thought you might get a kick out of it. It's been a while, Mom. - If you get a minute, call... - I'm sorry. your message has been erased. To re-record your message press one. Learn to drive! Please leave a message after the tone. Hi, Sawyer! Honey, it's me. Remember, once you get out of school you can turn your ringer back on. Call me. I miss you. And remember, I'm just a phone call away if you need anything. Love you, Honey. You have arrived. Yeah. Is this the New Haven shelter? Who are you? Oh, Rose Raynes. Bev sent me to replace Deirdre. I'm here to present to the ladies. Okay. Come on in. I'm Bigs. It's really nice to meet you, Bigs. I'm sorry, could I possibly get some help with my things? What things? Just some visuals. We'll play it by ear. Okay... Yes. Bigs! It's Friday. You know I need my insulin. I'm playing it by the rules. I'm playing it straight. You've got to play back with me. You want to play it straight, Jasmine? Go to class today and then I'll take you to get your insulin. See, I can't even tell you how many laws you violatin' by holdin' my meds from me. It's discrimination! It's blackmail, and I'm not even gonna mention the disabilities act 'cause I know my rights! You're not disabled, you're diabetic. Who Miss America? She is your teacher. You a real Miss America? No. Why do they keep bringing these pretty-ass white bitches to talk at us? So, where do the "white bitches" usually stand? Oh, right. Come on. Let's go. I'll show you where. In here. Come on. So, they'll pretty much sit anywhere. You can sit on the couch or that stool over there, maybe the rug, something like that? Ah, that's okay. I'll stand. Do you have an easel? A what? Never mind. Ladies! It's class time! Come on, let's go! You know, I did like two classes last night. So, I'm good. Yeah, that's great, but we didn't have any classes last night. Yeah, No. We watched one of those, things on Dr. Phil. It was a crazy intervention thing. Sammy and I watched it together. This woman with her daddy, her baby-daddy, her husband, whose child is it? Dr. Phil was sweating like Nixon. It... it changed me. Maybelle. Maybelle. Come out here. Bring your notebook. Let's go. Leslie! Coming! Life Skills! Hi! I'm Rose. Hey, you've got dinner duty tonight, right? Yeah, I got it. Oh, yes, I love me some Leslie-baby cooking. What you cookin'? You cook like a fat black woman. Hey, whatever twenty bucks of ingredients gets me. All right, all right. Notebooks, notebooks, and give me the phones, please. Give me the phones. Why you always gotta be takin' our cell phones. That's an invasion of privacy. House rules. No phones during class. What time is it? You got fifty-eleven clocks in here and none of them work. You got to tell me since I ain't got a phone. Why don't you get a watch? It's 3:04. This class ends at 4:00 p.m. I expect you to be outside waiting to take me to go get my insulin by 4:01 PM, Bigs. Oh, wait, I need to go, too, because I gotta get groceries for dinner. What's the matter with your car? It's moody. Yeah, me too. All right. Listen up! Class starts now. It's 3:05... 60 minutes, that's house rules. At 4:05, I will take anyone who wants to go on a little errand run, okay? What's your name again? Rose. Rose... is taking Deirdre's place this week, okay? Enjoy. - Thank you. - What's this? My bio. Could you please read it? ...why can't you read it? Well, it's written in third person, for someone else to... Typically before I present, someone introduces me? Yeah, that's what I just did. That's what I did. - I just introduced you. - I'll do it! "Rose Landry... Oh. Raynes. It's, Rose Raynes, now. Rose "Raynes" "Rose Raynes is a Phoenix native and daughter of Suzanna Landry and the step daughter of the Honorable Judge Joseph Landry. Rose graduated from Mesa Vista High School where she was captain of the cheer squad and the president of the Thespian Society." You know, I think my second husband left me for someone in the lesbian society. She said, "Thespian". That's them girls who twirl flags. - Thespian... - No, its... Actually, it's like the drama club. - Yes... Yes! - You know... acting. Oh, so you an actress. I was... You know what? Let's... let's forget the bio. Thank you. It's really out of date, anyway. Basically, what it says is, many, many years ago, I was Miss Arizona. And now, I'm here to teach a Life Skills class. I'm filling in for Dierdra, who... had some someplace else she had to be. I wish I had some else to be. You're being rude, now. You shut up, Maybelle! You the motor mouth! - Motor mouth, Maybelle! - You know what? Both of you! Shut up! Sit down, Jasmine. Thank you. Everyday, we each wake up and ask ourselves the same question. "What gift can I offer the world?" That is not my top question. Were you on TV when you were Miss Arizona? The National pageant was televised, yes. Ya know, I was on TV, too, in the studio audience of Let's Make a Deal and I almost got to come on down but this woman just bum-rushed the stage. She just lost her mind. Please! Just let her do her presentation! All right, then. Continue. The gifts we offer others should reflect our best selves, our brightest aspirations. Our boldest dreams. And, when... when we dig deep to find our inner beauty we discover the potential... of our outer beauty. We may not choose our names or where we were born but, the one present we always can control... is our presence. I'm sorry. I'm-I'm not prepared. I am not what you need. Nuh uh! Nuh uh, Miss Arizona! You ain't goin' nowhere! If you don't do this class, I don't get my insulin. Teach! Just keep going. You're doing great. Okay... How about a do-over. Yeah? Life Skills. Okay? You know what, why don't we go around the room and each of you tells me your name where you're from, and... how about what you want most in life. Right now. Jasmine let's start with you. Jasmine from south central, and I need 4:05 to happen. Great! Promise it will! Next. Her name's Sammy. She moved around a lot. Oh! Her parents in the military? Foster care. Right now, she just needs a safe place to stay. Well, then I'm glad you're here, Sammy. It's nice to meet you. Uh, my turn? Great. I'm Leslie. Born and raised a Dodger. "Whoa!" Um, I'm a hairdresser. Mother of three. 12, 10, and 7. And, what I need most right now is to find my boys. Get em back. And you don't know where they are? No. After Mick created his last masterpiece on me he... he changed the locks while I was at work. So, a friend recommended this place but they don't... They don't take kids here because there's not enough room. So, I just stayed here one night. Went back home the next morning to get the boys breakfast and off to school and, and they were gone. Anyway, Mick's still there in and out. I drive by on my way to work. Have you gone to the police? Of course, she's been to the police! They make her stand on line and fill out forms! That's their answer, their prescription for everything! Paperwork! Yeah, they referred me to a lawyer and a private investigator. The state prosecutor's backed up. I got a pro bono group reviewing my case. In the meantime, I'm um, saving my money and looking for my boys. Yeah, I'm Maybelle, short for Maybelline. I grew up in Tennessee. Lived all over the south, really. Followed my fourth ex-husband down here in '03. I'm kind of an expert on who not to marry. Divorce 101. That's a life skill I could teach! Sorry, what was your question, sweetie? Oh um, what you want most in life. Oh, what do I want most? A job! That way I could leave this joint. A job! Great! Let's start there. What would your dream job be? I think I would make a great life coach. Those who can't do, teach. Oh, let's not dismiss her dream. Okay, so to be a life coach or to get any job really, this... this is an area where your presence literally pays off! What is your job? Oh, I stay at home with my son. But, like before that. What did you do? Well, I got married young. Um. I tried acting for a minute and, You know, I spent my years as Miss Arizona, traveling and speaking to audiences. So what you saying is, you ain't never had no real job? She in here teachin' a job skills class and ain't got one! Bigs, is this some kind a joke or somethin'? Jasmine, class isn't over! Hey, being a mom is a job. So what, are you on any TV shows, like what shows what I've seen you on? It ain't like you got to apply to be no trophy wife. We in here trying to learn how to fill out job applications. Ever filled out one of them? I have, actually. You know, I'm trying to pick up a gig at night and I just... I don't even know what address to put. You can't list this one. For safety reasons, we just end up looking homeless. Yeah, I just make one up. You know, they never look, anyway. Well, on any application you only want to include things that cast you in a flattering light... awards, achievements. What if you have a felony? I... um... I mean, do I list that on my application? I-I guess it depends on the charge? Girl, you got a rap sheet a mile long. It only leads up to that felony. Well it makes sense when I explain it. So, you know when my fourth ex-husband left me, he took my dog. Let me tell you something. You threaten my dog, I'll shoot you in the face. I see. So, Miss Arizona. Does she need to put that on the application? ...I maybe wouldn't put that. See, you don't know nothing about how hard it is to find a job when the world don't need you. Actually, I do. Do you see that crown? That is the last time someone told me I was worth anything. Girl, stop! It look like you got a man taking pretty good care of you! Yeah, my husband hasn't looked me in the eyes since the day our son was born. And, Sawyer's ten. Today, he told me he's too old to hug me anymore. I'd get a job if I had a degree or experience in anything besides bleaching my teeth. Listen, I realize it might not seem like I have real problems but, you know what? I am here and I am willing to help in any way I can. Maybelle, you want to be a life coach? I believe you can! I don't know what it takes, but maybe I can help you find out. I can help all of you! Amen! She one of them girls that did a monologue for her talent. - Jasmine... - What! Why you gotta be like that? Hey, Bigs? You gettin' that? Yeah. The house line's unlisted. Sammy's ex got it somehow and called yesterday. We think he might know she's here. Which means here is a very dangerous place to be. Leslie! Is your car working today? Yeah, it's possible. I don't... Okay, we might be having some company. I need you guys to go and get Jasmine's medicine and don't come back until I call you, okay? - Okay. - Got it. Rose! I'm sorry, we're going to have to reschedule, okay? Oh, no. That's okay. Okay. Girl, damn your car! This car make me itch. You outta gas? It's the ignition. Come on! All right, all right. This isn't working. Let's get the Princess to take us. You know she's lookin' for somethin' to do. Come on, come on! Let it go! I hate this car! You ask her! Unlock it. You're taking us to the pharmacy. Uh, sure. Yeah. Hop in! This one of them cars that talk at ya? There's a voice control feature. You wanna step on it, grandma? We all got a good enough reason to get out of this neighborhood. Sure. Would think you more than the rest of us. We've hit the 5, the 405, the 101, all in Friday traffic! I said take the 110. Hmm. Let me see, valet. Ooh! So, somebody just come and park your car right now? No. Rich people. What is all this down here? So, if you put it on this, this is buying a Christmas tree? What's that? Is that for falling cactuses? Like if you get hit by a cactus? A cactus hits you in the side, you just press that? It's been like, an hour. More like three. If you give me an address, - we can punch it in. - I know where I'm going. Turn left. Oh, no no no. Turn right. What's the street name, maybe? Don't worry about it, princess. She knows the street! Sammy's carsick. Yeah, she's gonna hurl, if you keep making those hairpin turns. Y'all shut up back there. I know where I'm goin'. Besides, no one is getting car sick with Miss Turtle here on the wheel. Don't most people want to see how fast they can drive these things? See that's it. Right there. "Korean Pharmacy." Is it Korean insulin? There ain't no Korean insulin, they just got the best co-pays. Alright, y'all don't go off and leave me. Though, I'd catch up with the way you drive. Hurry. "Best co-pays." Yeah, I wanna get me some of that "Korean insulin." Is she diabetic? So, what does he do? Oh, are you asking me? Yeah, your husband. What does he do? Oh, he's a talent agent. Wait, like for actors? Yes. Do he know anyone famous? Well, he reps most of the people on that show. He packaged that show. Really? I love that show! Wait, so what does that mean, packaged? It's when an agent puts together like a, group deal of talent. Keeps things agency friendly, it's more commission. I always wanted to do hair on a movie set. I did a shampoo commercial once for a friend. I did a shampoo commercial! "Turn your locks lovely with Lovely Locks 2-in-1." I completely forgot I had a hair appointment. You know, Leslie can do your hair. Hang on, I think I saw your commercial. Dude, I recognize... I recognize you! I used to pay attention to that kind of stuff. Wait, did your husband get you that job? Only job he ever got me. Really. Yeah, he... he judged the Miss Arizona pageant. Promised me the world. Moved me to LA. But, then he signed some really big clients and... Anyway. I got pregnant, so. You ever meet Billy Bob Thornton? Wait, so do you like, go to the Oscars and stuff? I did once. Rick's actually at the Tonys this weekend. Really. So, why aren't you with him? Oh. It's just work for him. There's no point bringing me along. Well, Honey. There's just one reason a man doesn't want to bring his wife along. Miss America! Alright, they out. We got to go somewhere else. What's in your bag? My insulin. Don't worry I've got another supplier around the street. So, we can just make a quick little drive-by. Okay, do you think maybe we could stop at a store first? I mean, if Im cooking tonight, I need to get a few things. No, no. We're not going back 'til we get the all clear from Bigs. Well, I'm starving. We gotta eat some time. Okay, well there's a taco truck right there, so, twenty bucks of tacos it is. Okay, give me one chimichanga. A combo. I need some chips. I don't have enough. I told you. You can't have the munchies yet, it's only been like 5 minutes. Popped out like eight kids. Sammy. Just one taco? Rose, you sure I can't get you something? Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you. Are you sure? I got three bucks left. You don't want like a taquito or anything? You have it. We'll split it. You got all that extra money but you can't give me no chips? Zip it. Girl, you better eat that taquito! That's it. Thank you. Oh, no. No bueno? I just haven't really felt much like eating lately. I can't even imagine. Sawyer's at his first sleepover tonight and I... Mama can't rest without her cubs. You have a ten-year-old too, right? Yeah. What is he into? You know. Soccer, friends. Oh, who am I kidding. Not showering, not doing his homework, and you know, thinking he's too old for me. Mine, too. Sawyer used to be my little buddy. He would hold my hand at the mall, and play with my hair, and now, he just looks at me like, "Where you come from?" You'll get them back. I won't stop until I do. I worried this might happen. He always threatened that if I left, I'd never see my boys again. But, I just never... Anyway. At some point you have to wonder if you're doing your boys more harm letting them see their dad treat their mom a certain way, you know? Does she ever... Talk? Yeah, occasionally we can, you know, pull a few words out. It's a trust thing. I just think it's a lot easier for her to just live outside of her own life, you know? Bigs told me about when she first got to the shelter it was... it was bad. He... Her ex beat her broken. He... locked her in this tiny little garage shed for months on end. Wouldn't feed her unless she... performed. Found out the police were after him and he just like took off. Left her in there. No food. Took them two weeks to find her. Arizona! Good to go? You managed to finish half a taquito. Anyway. We appreciate you helping us. Yeah. Right here. To the right. Pull over. I don't see any drugstores. He does it outta of his house. Jasmine, are you buying drugs? Yeah, duh, of course! I told you. I am not assisting in your drug deal! Okay, hold tight. Ain't nobody gonna take your crown away from you. It's medicinal. I have a condition. It's legal now anyway. It's all over the news. Oh, are you talking about marijuana? Yeah, Sherlock. Oh, yeah, I've actually heard of the benefits. My friend's daughter has seizures and she said that the PCP oil has healing properties without getting you high. Yeah. You want to get that PCP oil any time you gotta headache, or you know, cramps or anything. That'll reallly work out. I'll be right back. Maybe we should just drive around the block. She said she'll be right back. Yeah, it might take her a little while to pay for it. Let's just drive around the block. Yeah. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! That house. That looks familiar. That's... that's Dusty's house. Who's Dusty? It's Mick's cousin. - Mick's Leslie's husband. - Ex! Ex. That's Mick's car. They're here! - My boys are here! - Hey hey hey! What are you doing?! - My boys are inside! - You got a death wish, huh? - No! - I know sweetie. What do you think, he's going to just hand them over to you? He's been hiding them from the cops for like two weeks! I'm going in there. She's right. This could be dangerous. We don't even know that they're in there. - Okay? - What! I know, just hang on. We can't be stupid about this. Rose, where are those file folders that you have? - They're in the back. - Okay. - Wait! - Hold it! You think a pageant brochure is gonna get me my boys back? I mean no offense, Rose, but... All right. Your boys have been out of school for like two weeks, right? Yes! Charlie, Leo, and James Miller. - Right? - Yes! My feeling is that paperwork has been started somewhere, right? What are you thinking? I'm thinking that you're dressed perfectly for your new job as the Assistant to the head of Child Protective Services. I'm your boss, I do the talking. Let's go! Please hurry! Hey, let's go! I thought you're an actress! What... Come on, Annette. Annette? We're not using our real names. Please! What if he pulls a weapon? I have a son, too, you know. People who were trying to keep their kids don't usually pull a weapon on the authorities. Why don't we call that authorities? We are the authorities. You and me! Will you just smile, and look pretty and serious. Lemme see that. Just keep your mouth shut. What? Mr. Miller? Who are you? I'm... Jasmine Maybelline. I'm the director of, Los Angeles Department of Child Protective Services, and this is my assistant, Annette, and we are here to speak to a... "Mick Miller" about the health and well-being of his children. Hold on a minute. Mick! What? Some ladies here to see you. C.P.S. Different ones than last time. Y-Yes! Unfortunately, our colleagues who were here just left a few holes in the paperwork. Not a big deal. Shouldn't take too long to fix. Yeah? Are you Mick Miller, the father of Leo, James, and Charlie Miller? Yeah. We're from C.P.S. I'm Jasmine and this is my assistant, Annette. Yeah, yeah, I already told you. My kids are staying with my sister, Sarah, for a while. Alright, when Leslie ran off, it about did them in. I gotta work. Unfortunately, our colleagues, when they mixed up the paperwork, We... we're just here to make it right. You know, sometimes when people, behave in a way that, um, is unreliable and... and leaves you feeling disappointed. So all we need is just, your sister's address and we can be out of your hair. It's just to process the file. You know. Paperwork. Will you grab my phone, Dusty? Paperwork. - Yeah. - Paperwork. It's just... "113 Hack's Cross Louisville, Kentucky 40206." Thank you so much. Just one more question. In your estimable opinion, Mr. Miller, do you feel like, Sarah is a competent guardian, temporarily, for these children while you work out your... domestic issues? No I... I don't got no domestic issues, all right? Their mother ran off! That's called abandonment. Waiting for the courts to prove it. You're not going to give this to Leslie now, are you? T-That bitch is crazy! She's gonna get them boys and she's going to hurt them again. Nope. This is just for our files. You've been so helpful. We're going to get going now. - Thank you so much. - Have a good night. Yeah. That was amazing! You could be an actress! What a waste of skin. We gotta make a clean getaway. Come on. Rose! Maybelle! Leslie! Wait up! Wait! Damn! - Who those dudes? They got... - Come on! Get in! Bitch! Dusty, get my gun and my keys! - Go, go, go! Why'd you leave me in the first place? Well, we found Mick. Where are my kids? - In Kentucky. - With his sister? Someone named Sarah. You know her? She's nuts! She lives in a commune in the woods. No phones. No electricity. - One of them Dateline cults? - God! He's telling everyone you abandoned them. What? No! - I would never do that! - We know you didn't. We'll get your kids even if we have to drive to Kentucky to get em. I don't think we can actually drive to... Step on it! We've got company. Pull over! Hey! Pull over! They're gonna kill us! Not if you drive! Step on it! They've got a gun! Pull over! Watch out! Come on! Pull over! We shook em! They're gone! You don't get out much, do you? Oh my gosh! Girl, scoot over, here I come. Move, girl! Move! Should we double-buckle? Girl, I will strangle you with that thing! Don't you harness me. Let me do my thing. I think we just got hit, but what... what happened? Do you have bulletproof windows in this thing? Rick bought this off a client. A rapper! It came with added security features. Surface wound! You've got insurance. This dead ends. Just sit back and spectate and let me drive! Hey, what's going on here? Just go man, just go, go! Y'all go on in. I'm gonna wait right here. Oh, you out already? - Good behavior! - Keep your nose clean. Working on it. Thank you. I told them! We know where they are, and what do they do? Start more paperwork! The Kentucky police said it would be Monday before they could file to start an official investigation. Damn paperwork. You can't wait until Monday for them to process. Your kids may be long gone by then! Right! Can't they send someone out? I mean, they sent someone to the general area that I described. They said that they found some old burnt building. I mean, it's ridiculous! They can pull up her old library fines and her old expired DMV records, but they can't find my kids! We're not waiting till Monday, all right? We're going to get you to Kentucky. - All right. - OK. Come on. Let's go. I know how far it is. I lived there. I really don't think I can drive to Kentucky. My son comes home tomorrow. I'm so sorry. Oh, of course not. I wouldn't expect you to go. No, no we're not driving there. It would take too long. He'd get the word out. By the time you got there, the kids will be long gone. Maybelle, I don't have room on my card to book a plane ticket. I do! I have money. Lots of it. Well, I don't, my husband does, but I have a credit card. I can fly you to Kentucky. Wait. You would, you would do that? Of course! What's up? We're gonna fly Leslie to Kentucky. All right. Let's see. Nonstop. Do you prefer economy, business, or first? I've... I've never been on a plane. - Really? - No. Pick whatever's gonna get her there first. Well, all seats technically arrive at the same time. Just book it! ...business. More legroom. Aisle or window? - I don't... - Window. There's a red eye that leaves from LAX in four hours. You can make it! - Thank you so much! - Of course! There's only one seat left. Okay well then book it before it's gone! I'm so happy with... What?! It says declined! I bought a dress in case Rick got an extra ticket to the Tonys. Can you return it? It's not with me. You haulin' around in this tank and you ain't got no more than gas money. Rick likes to keep low limits on credit cards. I bet he ain't got no low limits on his credit cards. Let me check my debit. Money's really not my strong suit. I'm sorry. It looks like you the one who need a life skills class. You guys, Bigs just texted, "Coast not clear. Stay away." Just get Bigs' credit card. Bigs ain't got no eight hundred dollars. Well, maybe New Haven? What am I supposed to say? I need 800 bucks to flee the program so I can chase down my kids? Let me make a call. Sorry. She fake... She fake! It's not for a hair appointment. It's an emergency. OK. This is why you have an emergency credit card. With a thousand dollar limit! Rick, please. I really need it. It's just eight hundred dollars. Take it from my allowance, now, come on. It's not for that wallpaper, is it? Because the bathroom does not need grasscloth, Rose. No this isn't about wallpaper. It's an emergency. It's for a friend. A loan. Okay, which one of your friends needs 800 dollars? It's for a woman I met at a shelter today. Okay, so you want to give a loan to a homeless person? You can kiss that goodbye. And why'd you miss your hair appointment? I had to pull strings to get you... You've reached Judge Edward Landry. Suzanna and I will be off the grid on safari. Beverly Hills go on strike? I never thought it would be so hard to drum up 800 dollars. - I'm sorry. - It's ok. I got a guy who owes me a favor. What kind? Not what you thinking. Come on, let's drive. Leslie girl, you lucky I love you. What you got here? What's in this box? What is this? Oh, God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever seen! What is that? Why is this in your car? Let me guess! It's your talent! Yes. That is Lolly. - Lolly? - They have names. What's so funny? Do you still practice, what is it, puppeteering? Ventriloquism? No, no, no. She hasn't come out of the closet in like, fifteen years. There's no place like West Hollywood. He works over there.

Whoever wins that purse tonight gets fifteen hundred dollars, right? Right? So, we're going to win it! Specifically, you! What?! No, no. I'm... I'm not a "queen" like that I'm not... I saw this movie once. The actress who played Mary Poppins she was a woman who dressed as a man, who dressed like a woman. So, you're an actress. You just gonna dress like a queen. OK, there are so many problems with that plan. Don't even get me started. Why? You won Miss Arizona, right? Yeah, but... But this is just... you know... You got a car full of talent. You got gowns, you got outfits. - You even have a crown. - But, she's not a man. You identify as a woman, right? - Of course, but... - Of course. So, in a lot of people's book that would qualify you. Where is your makeup? - In the car. - Great. You know you can't just turn up and enter these things. There's always a procedure. There's forms to fill out. Paperwork. I'll take care of it.

I don't lose paperwork. So you saying you ain't never lose anything before? You never lose your mama's lipstick? You ain't ever lose the championship soccer game 'cause sports just wasn't yo "thing?" You never lose your mind when an election didn't go your way? - I didn't know... - Nah! See, Miss Arizona ain't no loser. She came here to win. Now, we done taped her and padded her and flew all the way in business class from Phoenix, Arizona to help her. Now you gone help us? Or, you gonna help us?

This is an opportunity for you to tell us who you really are, what you really like.

And tonight, if you vote for me for Showdown Show Queen, you and I can do some good for those kids at base camp. You're going to need to state your name and your causes, okay? My cause. What's my cause? Just talk about your brochures or something. I don't know. It's not your first rodeo. Sweetheart, we all know you support the NRA. I brought the guns tonight. Buongiorno! I'm Luscious... as they come and I am thrilled to bring attention to the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice. Now, introducing Miss Arizona Night! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Arizona Night and I'm here to show support for... the New Haven Women's Shelter. May we all dare to hope and dream. Thank you, Arizona. Last, but certainly not least, Miss Delilah! Don't you mean save the best for last? Hi. I'm Delilah, the host of your local Talk Truth show. And I'm delighted to be here tonight as an authentic champion for gay rights. Tonight, I plan on donating half of my prize money to the True Colors Foundation, and I hope to inspire all the contestants to reveal their true colors. "Hello." - "This is crazy!" - You are so weird. What? I'm not weird. I'm totally normal. Do you remember how to do this? Yeah, is it kind of like riding a bike, or what? Riding a bike. Oh my god! You just threw your voice! No, no! Well, I don't do monologues. - Jesse to Braxton. - Braxton to Jessee. - Jesse to Braxton. - Braxton to Jesse, hello? Our first finalist is Delilah, dancing to... Slave! I'm sure Emerald is loving that. Are they a thing? Delilah's the puppet, Emerald's the strings, literally and legally. He's Delilah's agent. Hot Hollywood gossip, but you didn't hear that from me. Stay out of their way. Delilah needs to win this title tonight. Thinks it's gonna to get her talk show picked up by a network. How long have you known Emerald? A year or so. She's pretty new to the scene. Where are you from, honey? Arizona. Of course. and what are you running from? Nothing. This is a long way from Arizona. Yeah, I guess so. How long have you been doing this? Competing? Sure. Child, I've been performing onstage since I was about 17 years old. My mom accepted me as is, my dad... didn't. So, after he moved out, Lucious moved in and I came out. Junior year of high school. What does your puppet do? Lolly? We sing duets. Now is it hard to talk and sing through your mouth like that? Not once you get the hang of it. It's actually kind of nice sometimes. Being able to say whatever you want. I heard that! Let's here it for Delilah! - Our second finalist is Ginger. - Yay! Work it out, Ginger! Yes! - Let them have it! - What is your talent! I salsa dance. - Oh! - But, I'm not dancing tonight because I have a bad ankle. But, what if they call your name? They won't. I already told them. I'm just wearing this because it's comfortable. I made it myself. You make costumes? Day job. I work in theater. Wait, so are you out of the competition, then? Most of us aren't here to win a crown. Gazelle just likes to sing. Sunshine is an insurance broker that lives in the valley. For some of us, it's a platform. For all of us, it is an art form. A way of feeling beautiful. So, you don't care about the money? Oh honey, I stopped leanin' on the green a long time ago. You know what they say. The love of money is the root of all evils. That is true. But tonight, I could really use the money. And, what would you do with it? Something important. Hmm. Well, Arizona, good luck to you. I need to reapply. Arizona? They're looking for you. Slay them sister! Slay them! Thank you. You're welcome. ♪ So fly high in spite of the pain ♪ ♪ don't listen to darkness ♪ dream your own way...

What are you saying? I'm saying she is a she! Emerald just told me she works with her husband. What? Is that true, Arizona? And she stole my gloves. Ladies, meet Miss Rose Raynes, aka Miss Arizona. And now, why you got to come invade our show? No woman's stealing my show! Wait. Stop. She did it for me. My ex-husband did this, and he also shipped my kids off to Kentucky and if we don't get there before he does tonight, I may never see them again. So, please. What does this have to do with that? Okay? Because we needed the money to get there. That's all! And we just thought Miss Arizona could win. No offense, y'all. No offense, y'all, but there's a whole lot of other ways to make a little bit of money. Okay!? You know what? You're right, and we tried. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to take anything from you. I was... I was just trying to help. Come on, let's go. Stop! You're not going anywhere, until you've got your money. Her money? - She can't compete! - And, who are you? Why are you here? Why are we all here? This is not about winning. - Destiny. - Yes? Your sequined outfit costs twice as much as this prize. Well, that is true, I mean, but really. We're here being true to who we are, which most of the world doesn't want us to be. So, if we're going to continue to demand love, then we need to start giving it, girls. Okay? I, for one, don't think that what Miss Arizona is doing is really all that bad. Me, neither! Well, I do! And I'm telling Braxton! Miss Thing? You tell Braxton, and I will show him the video that Miss Ginger just took of what you did to Miss Arizona's personal property, to the cop that's out in the audience. Two different angles! He's not here to do the YMCA. Oh, come on... You know, I wore this dress when I won Miss Arizona. It's okay, Sweetheart. You can borrow anything of mine. Anything! Girl, what's she supposed to do with, use that as a tent? Oh, step down! I made half of your costumes. Okay? - That's gonna require a lot of stuffing. - Oh, please. I'm just saying, she got to stuff a lot. Look, we can piece something together. You're gonna be fine. I... is your radio on? The jig is up, Rose. Or what, Gary? The way I see it you have a lot more to lose than I do with our little run in, tonight. Oh, Sweetheart! Before you bring this up at the company picnic, take a look out there. There's Cliff, there's Emily, and there's your little friend. - Vicki? - Yeah, Vicki. Vicki knows, Bev knows, everybody knows. I know how to take care of the clients. Now, look. I don't know who put you up to this charade, and I don't know what you're looking for, but you're not gonna find it here. So... I think it's time for you to go home, Rose. It's past your bedtime. Eight hundred dollars for me to drop out. That's easy. I'll wire it to you in the morning. Each finalist will join me onstage to answer one last question. That will be too late. Good luck to Delilah. I'll be right back. And, audience! That's when we throw to you. Her kids are going to be gone in she doesn't get there. - I mean, why would I dress in drag for no reason? - I know, I can help you. - I'm going to help you. - Yeah? Yes. I got this. Our first finalist is like a cool glass of sweet tea. Miss Ginger! Hello, Miss Ginger. Tell us. What does it mean to you to be beautiful? Thank you. To me, beauty means finding the light in all of the darkness. I may never be the pretty one, but I will always be the beautiful one. Our next finalist, the one and only, Delilah! Hello, Miss Delilah. Delilah, what does it mean to you to be beautiful? Thank you, esteemed judges and panel. Being beautiful to me means taking time to honor the inner queen you are. And I have a big inner queen in me. What is it? It's my husband's best friend, and he owes me a huge favor. Arizona! - Arizona? - It's in here somewhere. - They're calling my name. - Just, just go. Arizona, they need you. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Nice dress! All right, Arizona. Let's get serious. You got to tell us. What does it mean to you to be beautiful? Go on, girl! I was born into a world where I was trained from the time I was a little girl to sit still and look pretty. But, as I've grown, I've learned that outer beauty can hide a hollow shell. Friendship. Being kind. Helping others. Looking out for those who need us most. And doing whatever it takes to be there for them. That's what makes us beautiful. Arizona, please clarify. You said "since I was a little girl?" If that statement is true, technically, you'd be disqualified. - Disqualify her! - Go enter Miss America! She did the right paperwork! She checked all the right boxes! Arizona. What's up? Are you a female, or what? Come straight. Yes, I am. Okay. That disqualifies you from the competition. Now, we'll fill that final position with our next finalist, Destiny, who will now show us her talent. And she looks ready. All right. It's about damned time. Who's ready for some Hot Stuff? I got all the hot stuff you need, okay? ♪ Sittin' here, eatin' my heart out waitin' ♪ ♪ I'm waitin' for some lover to call ♪ The winner is... Miss Delilah! Whoa! Get back here, Arizona! That should have been me up there! You took my spot! I didn't mean to take anything from you. This was supposed to be our night! There are hundreds of nights for girls like you. Hey, hey, hey! Back off! Hey! Go on, Ariziona! Get out of here! - Don't you touch my white girl! - Go on, Arizona! Get out of here! Go! Kick her ass, sea bass. Touch her again! Touch her again! You don't want this! You... Where's Rose? Where's Rose at? I knew she was a girl when she walked up in here, girl, I told y'all. - Y'all didn't believe me. - Nobody could ever believe you. All you do is lie. - The devil is a lie. - That's how I got in this mess. I can't believe you got into that mess. - Must have took a whole bucket of Crisco. - Somebody had to do it, okay? I have to pull over. Hey, hey, you did your best. It's okay. Yeah, you probably wouldn't have made the plane anyway. No, it's not that. That was the weirdest night of my life. When that song came on! "Man, I feel like a woman!" When I woke up this morning, I never thought my day would end up here. But I'm really glad it did. Yeah. I wish you'd won the money, though. No! No, we did! We won, we definitely won! I forgot to tell you. We are getting you to Kentucky. What? - What? - Yes! Yay! You found it. - I tried calling you. - I must have left my phone. It's okay. Everything is set. Come on. Watch your step. The big planes are with the rest of the agency in New York. But, this one can get her to Louisville nonstop. The pilot just can't get here till 7 a.m. But, there's a diner down the street if you guys want to kill some time. Yeah, that's perfect! OK, now I've got to get back to the club because I literally left everybody there. But, I'll be back here in the morning. - Thank you so much. - Of course. Best burger I ever ate. So, you think you'd really work at a place like this? Yes. Why is that so funny? I don't know, because you'd have to touch things like, butter. You've all told me that you've worked in diners. I don't see why the idea of me working in a place like this is so funny. You know they make you wear polyester. And rubber shoes. Rubber shoes! - Shoes! - Rubber shoes! You too, huh? I've never had a real job, and I just, I don't know, I think it might be fun. It really isn't. But, why a diner? Growing up, I was never allowed to eat food like this as a kid. My mom had a sign in the kitchen: "Nothing tastes as good as thin feels." But, all the people on TV and commercials and stuff, whenever they eat food like this they always seem so... happy. I don't know, I think it might be fun to serve people all this happy grease. You know what else is fun? What? Eating it. Here. For you. - Oh, no. - Oh, no no. One little ole bite. It's not gonna kill you. - I'm fine. - You'll still be a negative size 2. Stop. I'm fine. - Do it. - Do it. - Do it, do it, do it, do it! - Do it, do it, do it, do it! Guys! Fine, fine! Alright, fine! I will take a bite. Here we go. - It's good. - Just good? It's amazing! - That was easy. - This is so good! Oh. I don't know if I can swallow this. It's delicious! Your mother would be proud. Beautiful! I'll take this whenever you guys are ready. - It's sixty-two dollars! - What? Jasmine, you said these burgers were four bucks each? What the? On the kid's menu! What? Oh, look at Miss America. Living the dream. I hope you enjoy. It is so good. Hey! Tyhefe! That dude owe me money! Don't you drive off Tyhefe! I done told you! I told you I'd be lookin' for your butt! Take me to the ATM right now! Take me to the ATM, Tyhefe. Is she gonna be alright? There's one right across the street. Jasmine's always gonna be alright. That's one way to get to Kentucky. How you doing, Sammy? I'm kind of scared. Oh, baby. You got us. I don't want to go back. He knows. No, no, if our location gets out, New Haven will move us. Hey, Rose. How many people will fit in that plane? I don't know? Four or five? What if we all go? Afraid, I can't cross state lines, right now, ladies, but... I wish I could. I have to pick up my son in three hours. Can I come? Oh my gosh, that would be so great. Get a fresh start? Well, what about your things? Should we go get them? I have my ID. - You ready? - Yeah.

Well, not officially yet, but they did have a consultation, which creates a conflict. Okay. Okay, they? Who is they? Oh, dear. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say. Right. I understand, but Mrs. Raynes already came in. Yeah. Yeah. Let me guess. For a "consultation." Well, I can tell you right now, she's not hiring your firm either so, why don't you go ahead and tell me who's the douche bag she came in with? No. That was no douche bag. That firecracker was her life coach. I didn't think I could ever love you again. After all we've been through. But then I realized... it was all my fault. I made you react the way you did. When I set your car on fire, I forgot your brother was hog tied in the trunk. Rose! Hey, realtor's here. You ready to sign? - Yes. - All right. I'm going go pick up the bunk beds. Perfect. Did you get the trundle? Rita, the one from Pasadena? She has three kids coming with her. Yeah. Got it. See you, Boss. - Bye, Bigs. - See you, Bigs. Let's go, Sawyer. Are you sure I'm right for this part? This woman is kind of a psychopath. What are you talking about? I don't see it that way. She's more of a problem solver. Just like you. Hi. Good to see you again. I love that you're opening this home as a women's shelter. Once we repaint, replace the carpet... they're gonna love it.
