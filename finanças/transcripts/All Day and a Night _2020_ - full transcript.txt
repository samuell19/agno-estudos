You a lightweight hangin' with the right people. - [La-Trice] Mm-hmm. - ♪ I'm curious ♪ [laughs] And shit, you always stay mad and stressed out anyway. You may as well take that shit out on somebody. - Shit, I cook to relax. - [La-Trice] Mm-hmm. - You know my brother Raalo? - Nah. Well, he upstate, and, uh... I'm shorthanded. Marinate on that. And your first job could be to pop Malcolm's ass if you can find him. Hell yeah, that mark-ass nigga. [La-Trice shakes and rolls dice] Something wrong, nigga? Nah. - I'm good. - Smile then or something. You fucking up my mood right now. They sayin', uh... Lamark's surgery ain't go too good. Shit, I don't know why his ass joined the military in the first place. Motherfuckin' government don't give a fuck about us. I'll be damned if I lose my life over they asses.

That was after my brother got shot, Jah. Oh, fuckin' miss me. I told you I acted wild then. I didn't know you then. - Miss me with that shit! - I didn't know you. I don't give a fuck about none of that fuckin' shit, a'ight? I don't want my baby mama being a goddamn ho! Fuck you, Jahkor! 'Cause me and this baby gon' be straight regardless. All 'cause your motherfuckin' pride is hurt. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, all right. - Yeah. And you can take your motherfuckin' ass in the fuckin' house, go your ass inside of the fucking house, grab my motherfuckin' shit, and bring my motherfuckin' car keys. - Go get my fuckin' car keys! - I'm getting them! I'm getting your fuckin' keys, nigga! Yeah, a'ight. Take your keys, nigga! 'Cause I've been takin' the motherfuckin' bus. And you know what? You ain't nothin' but a hypocrite. - 'Cause I know you been cheating on me. - Come on, babies. I know you been cheatin' on me, and I ain't done shit with nobody! Know what, Taye? If I did... it's because I never trusted your motherfuckin' ass in the first place. I mean, how you expect me to be faithful to a goddamn ho? Fuck you, Jahkor. - Yeah, a'ight. - Yeah, because I loved you, that's how. And that's all that should motherfuckin' matter! [introspective piano music playing] [Jahkor] It's like... a million tiny cuts... that don't seem to matter until you realize... - I ain't being racist either. - ...your ass is bleeding to death. I'm just tired of people like Jah acting like bein' gangsta about your shit is just a black thing. 'Cause all I do... all I do is ride and keep it lit. A'ight, a bitch like me don't even fuck with nobody that ain't gangsta. See, my nigga a fucking D-boy. Moving zips... sippin' codeine. All that. So I don't give a fuck. I'm a down-ass ratchet bitch. A'ight, I... I bleed this shit with ten toes down in it. Follow that motherfucker right there. It lit? About to get some rims, nigga. - Say "lit." - Easy mark. ["Ayy" by Slimmy B playing] [TQ] Police everywhere, nigga. Today ain't gon' be my day, Jah. I ain't going to jail off no bullshit. Bruh, we on one way the fuck out here. I'm about to bounce back to the crib, nigga. This is fuckin' ridiculous. Talkin' all that shit. And livin' all the way out here. White people get on my fuckin' nerves. Why? Why does what some white bitch do even matter? Hmm? Why do anybody matter? If all you gonna do is react to other people, what they say, what they think of you, and what they do, then you ain't shit but they puppet. 'Cause I could give a fuck about white people. I'm a predator, nigga. All that matters is me. You need to open up your eyes, cuddie. 'Cause that's the American way. - [siren whooping] - Damn. [Jahkor] Do you ever notice how police act just like they do on TV? It's like they watch that shit just to see what to be like. So what were you doing in a neighborhood like Blackhawk? You sure you want to play dumb? Now, come on, Jah, you and your ace motherfucka, Anthony McFadden, a.k.a. TQ the dope dealer. Oh, you didn't realize we knew about him, did you? Damn, if we didn't find a brick of that white girl in his truck. Cocaine. Yeah. That's ten years, Jah. He don't want to do that bid. So, Q... That's what I like to call him. Y'all usually got people on the other side of this watching me and shit, right? Says you work for Stunna. See what we got here. You've already pled down an armed robbery. Robbing a liquor store, resisting arrest, home invasion. Juvenile report. Your father's serving life? Says he, uh... spent a couple months in the psych ward. He's a dope head. Is it genetic? Genetic? Dope? Nah. It ain't. Doesn't matter. Want me to call your parole officer? Don't let me find out that you missed an appointment, lost a job... This is some fuckin' bullshit, and you know it, man! I don't know why the fuck I'm up in here, bruh! I want to believe you, Jah, I do. I do. But you gotta give me something here. You know, just... something I can use, just some... fuckin' information, man, just... What about that turf war that's brewing between Malcolm and Stunna? - Can you talk about that? - I don't know shit about that. Come on, you must know something. You roll with TQ, right? Is it true he's working with Malcolm to unify the organizations behind Stunna's back? Hmm? You know, Malcolm's been around a long time. He's a big fish. Like I said... I don't know no niggas... named Malcolm. Or Stunna. [Jahkor] They pick you up for anything when you on parole. TQ never carried dope in his whip. You need to get rid of that old thing. D'you bring that money like I asked for them tickets? Ray Ray got it. Who the fuck is Ray Ray? My new man. - Ey, what's up, young playa? - What up, bruh? - Yo, how much was that shit? - Nah, don't worry about it. - Do anything for your mama. - Say thank you. Yeah, a'ight. Where we taking you? Got my car over there... in the east. Boy, I'm not even gon' ask you why you was all way out in Blackhawk around all them white people. Just hope you breaking her for some money. - It ain't even like that. - Okay. So you like them white girls, huh? - Wassup? - You ain't gotta front, young blood. I see a bunch of you youngsters out there running with them pale faces. - Hey, nigga, you don't fuckin' know me. - Jah, stop. - Ray, open the door. - Might know my mama, but you don't know me, bruh. Now you wanna get serious? You feelin' hurt? - Open the door. - Yeah, I am feelin' hurt. Ray. My bad, baby. My bad. I just thought your son was grown. I didn't know I had to walk on eggshells around him. Young boy be feelin' fragile and shit. Open the car. Jah. Jah, don't fuckin' do... Jah! - Nigga, you out your motherfuckin' mind? - I might be, nigga! Jah, I'm fuckin' tired of this shit! - I'm just opening up my mama's eyes. - We're outside the station! You wanna come around, walkin' around here like a motherfuckin' boss, nigga? Listen to me. - Just get in the fucking car. - Then school me. - Get in the... - What do real-ass, savage-ass... Jah, shut the fuck up! ...OG-ass niggas do when a young blood like myself step outta pocket? This is shit. Baby, look at me. Get in the fuckin' car. - Jah, what the fuck? - Man, fuck that nigga, Ma! What the fuck is wrong with you, Jah? Why you always gotta fuckin' be acting like this? You're just like JD was, fucking crazy! I don't want you nowhere near me no more! What?

Nigga, where that weed at? I know y'all got some fine kush in here. Say less, my nigga. I got you. [Jahkor] I quit the shoe store after Stunna started paying me to post up. And shit, mostly just watch that nigga cook. Told you this thing was gonna be smackin'. And you didn't catch her 'cause you couldn't check her phone? - Yes, ma'am. - I never cheated on him. I never cheated on him. But she hasn't caught me physically. They stupid. There you go. Rest your feet, blood, roll one. Hey, taste this. Motherfucker's smackin', ain't it? - This shit fire. - Smackin', right? That shit's smackin', right? Shit, man. I told that nigga it was gonna be good. Where that YouTube at? Thought I forgot, nigga.

That's why they at us so tough. They need clients, customers, knocks. And this plug gotta be one of them Mexicans. The fuck you thought? They don't wait on no money. You gotta pay them on time, feel me? [Stunna] They don't want the new clientele he tryin' to push. - [La-Trice] More weight. Exactly - More drama. We getting a little too loose with all these niggas around here. Well, that's why I'm here, nigga. Let me get that nigga Malcolm for y'all. Oh, you been thinking about what we talked about, huh?
