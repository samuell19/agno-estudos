Hey. We're done. All right. - There you go. - Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. - Allô? - You have a collect call from... Daniel Léger. Would you like to accept charges? Yes. Hey, Mom! How are you? I'm good. You sound... better? I'm doing much better, yes. That's nice to hear. I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. I know it was last month, but I was in the woods, and I couldn't call. It's OK. Listen, I need a small favor. Don't tell Dad, OK? But I'm at a gas station... I have my paycheck, but I don't have any cash on me. Can you give this guy your credit card number? It's only, like, $10. Uh... I don't know. Mom, it's not for drugs. You know that, right? Your father is walking in. I have to go. Mom, come on. You don't buy dope with a credit card! Allô? - $7.50. - Yeah. - Add, uh, one of these, okay? - Yeah. Let me just go grab my wallet. I'll be right back. Hey! At any given time, about how many children do you have in your care at the institution, Mr. Woodbridge? Despite massive cuts in government grants, we've managed to keep caring for more than 20 kids, which is why we created the foundation... Yes, but before we get to that, I'd like you to outline your methods for dealing with difficult children, if you don't mind. Certainly, uh, but, if I may finish, the foundation... Now, I'm speaking specifically about the recent suicides of two young boys, ages 11 and 12, that were in your care at the institution. - Norm! - No, no. Not now. What was that? Somebody's trying to get ahold of you, Mr. Malarek. And I think it's time for me to leave too. - Oh, shit. - We have testimonies on tape if you'd like to hear them and refresh your memory, you piece of shit. Mr. Woodbridge, I'm so sorry about the interruption. I-I... We have a few more questions. Mr.... Why in the hell did you leave your pager on, man? Ah, it doesn't matter. We got that son of a bitch. I know, but if it went off 20 seconds earlier, - we would've had nothing. - Yeah, but did you see the look on his face? - I did. - Victor, security left a message. Some guys from the Da Silva gang are looking for you. - They're here? - Yeah. Front reception. Ah... - Victor, what is this about? - What? - Do you want me to call the police? - Shit. Do you want me to call the police? - What? - The police. No! No, no, no, no. No police. Get your camera. He's here! Come on, let's go! Malarek! Malarek! Shit. Where are you going? Malarek, stop! - Get in the car! - Let's go. Get these fuckers! Get them! Are you filming? Rolling? Okay, let's go. Fuck. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Aw, fuck me. You run from us to a hospital? Expect to get hurt, Malarek? You think I'm running away from you, you piece of shit? Huh? Write another article about Da Silva, we'll make sure you end up in here. Let's get out of here. You tell Da Silva he can kiss my ass. Oh! Hi. I'm looking for Anna Malarek's room. - Victor! - Anna Mala... - Oh, God. - Denise. We paged you over and over. - I was in an interview. - I hope it was worth it. It cost you a moment you'll never get back. - She's done already? - Some things don't work around your schedule. - How is she? - She's fine. - Hey. - Hey. I'm so sorry. It's okay. No, it's not. I missed everything. She moves fast. Like her dad. There you go. Yeah, that's your dad. Oh. Hi. Yeah. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. - Stay with me. - Yeah. Good. Wow. Well done. Thanks. Dubé got the job? Yeah, they just announced it. I figured. Probably found out Friday night, kept his mouth shut. I don't know what the hell they were thinking. Lowest pay grade. What? I'm fine. I knew I wasn't gonna get it. Can I help you? Uh, I'm the guy who rented this place. You must have the wrong address. Um... Where's Michael? You know Michael? What do you mean, I don't deliver? Well, uh, we haven't had anything from you in two months. I just gave you the Da Silva story. That was a follow-up piece. You want shocking stories? They take serious research. Long-term investigations take time. Then perhaps you should spend a little less time on your TV show and a little more time here with us. The TV thing's part-time. You know that. Mr. Malarek, when you write something new, we'll pay you for it. But from now on, when you write nothing, we pay nothing. - Did I just get fired? - No, no. You're just gonna be freelance. Oh, Art, come on. You can't make me a stringer. I just had a baby. Why don't you just let me give you regular assignments, that's it? I don't do regular assignments. Ha! Okay. But your mind's in 93 orbits at once. You just gotta land on something. I don't give a shit. Pick an easy subject. You do one story a week, you make the exact same money. That's it. Look, Art, it's not about the money, all right? It's about my process. All right. You and you process get together, do one story a week. I'd like to cash this. Twenty, 40, 60, 80, 100... - There you go. - Cheers, man. What can I get for you? Directions. What do you mean by directions? Looking for a guy called Michael. Gentlemen, it is my true honor to be here today. And I welcome the chance to work with each and every one of you. But make no mistake. We are all soldiers in a war on drugs. The last few years have been... Daniel! Bro. Hey, man, this is the guy I'm telling you about, my best friend, Daniel, man. How you doing, bro? - Fine. I see you're doing well. - Yeah, man! Hey, Glen! This is fucking Daniel. This is his boat. Smooth, right? Hey, what's the problem with the house? Glen! This is the guy, man. You know, my trip to Thailand. - Thailand? - Yeah. Thailand party guy? Fucking A, man! The Thailand party guy. Holy shit. Hey, Thailand party guy. I'm the BC party guy. Small fucking world, huh? Small as shit. Fuck. There's something I want to show you. Uh, Aimee, get him a beer. Thailand party guy, come over here. Hey, bro, you, uh, you still owe me money for the work I did on the boat, remember? The fuck I do. Where is it? He owes me a payment. Where the fuck is it? Where the fuck is it? And what the fuck are you doing on my boat? - I... - Hey, whoa. He just got here, man. He's my buddy. Remember? - Oh, he's your buddy? - Yeah. What the fuck are you asking me for money? I owe you? No, no! I was kidding. Man, I was just kidding. You piece of shit! Where is my shit? It's probably in the bedroom where you leave all your stuff. Oh, fuck. It is. Shit. You guys looked like you were gonna fucking shit your pants. Fuck. Give me a second. Aimee. Are you gonna fucking kiss her or what? He's crazy. But he's got awesome drugs. I don't care. What's wrong with the house? She didn't let you in? I sent you some cash for rent. I had a few setbacks. Relax, man. Found it. Ah! This is what I wanna show you, Thai boy. This... Oh! Now, Michael tells me you brought some Thai number four into BC. He told you that, huh? Shit. I'd love to taste that. I mean, you can't find that shit anywhere here. - All right, I gotta go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck? I only bring this shit out for special people. Ask Michael. Fuckin' A. True, man. By the way, this smackity-yak is, like, 90% pure. W-W-Well, close enough. I don't shoot up, so... That's cool, that's cool. I don't wanna die either. That's why I like to smoke it. Give me the lighter. Fucking... I appreciate it, man, but I'm okay. Oh, you think you're too good for my shit? Ain't no place you gotta be but heaven. I'll let you in on a secret. If you're really nice to these two angels... they'll smoke the paper off your joint. Mmm... How long has it been? Six months. Welcome home, friend. Art. Big-time drug dealer. Real prick, this guy. Gets arrested in Bangkok, but when he's arrested... Right. Police officer dies. We already covered the story. Do you actually read your own newspaper? You guys covered a 50-word press release. I do a two-parter, bring in all the background. How does the international heroin trade work? I mean, how does the shit get from Thailand into our country? Right. Pull a bunch of drug-trade stats anyone can get. - No, no. - No. I don't think so. I put flesh on it, all right? An agent killed in the line. Who is this badass drug dealer? Two North Americans meet their fates halfway around the world in Bangkok, right? Deliver it by Saturday? Saturday? Sure. Saturday and Sunday. It's a two-parter. - Yeah. - Two parts, two paychecks. Okay. Did you just double your salary? Ah. He's alive. Hey, have you seen Michael? Yeah, he left a couple hours ago. Taking a bus back to Montreal. Shit. Did that cocksucker take some cash from you? Some cash? He took everything I had. You can't trust a junkie. Dude, uh, we got clients coming in ten minutes, and you kind of look like run-over dog shit. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'll get out of your way. No, I said we got clients. You want a job? Oh, man. I-I appreciate the offer, but I don't know anything about fishing. Plus, I gotta... I gotta find a place to stay. You can stay in the cabin. It's small, but what the fuck? It's free, right? You serious? As a heart attack. I've had my tough times. Just put on a shirt. It's not a gay cruise. Pays $80 a day, plus tips. Okay. Victor. - Sergeant. - Surprise visit. I'm doing an in-depth piece for The Globe. I thought a live interview could make it more human. Do you mind? There have been no news items released today. I'm thinking an oldie, but a goodie. What are your thoughts on the Thailand bust? Was the whole thing worth it? It's a tragedy. That's all I can say. Yeah, but, I mean, you guys must be in shock. Well, you can say that again. Now, come on, Bill. Throw me a quote here. Anything I can use other than, "It's a tragedy"? Well, the point of an operation like this is to make Canada a safer place. Now, a major heroin pipeline was shut down. And when an officer dies in the line of duty, it's a sad reminder of how dangerous this job really is. Okay. I read the press release. But this asshole you arrested, why is he still in Thailand? We were invited only to assist the Thai police for this operation, Malarek. - He'll be prosecuted there. - But what's this prick's story? - Everything's in the press release. - Nothing's in the press release. Who is this guy? How long has this guy been running heroin out of BC? I don't have any more comments. The matter is before the courts in Bangkok, okay? I'm not allowed to discuss the intricacies of this, especially with you. That's it? Thanks, Sergeant. All right, keep it going, guys. Here you go. Oh, my God. Those guys loved you. They even left you an extra tip. Or we could do... the trade again. Your call. You know, I was thinking... if I play my cards right, this could be my boat soon. Yeah? Hell, we could be partners, make some real money. - You serious? - Yeah. It's funny how things work out. I can't tell you how much I appreciate everything you've done for me. Hey, uh, don't smoke that yet. I need a ride to the airport. The airport? Where you going? Colombia. Got a meeting, last minute. All right. Shit, I almost forgot to ask you. Can you do me a favor? Go to that address, uh, ask for Mary. She has a package. Can you grab it for me? And if you could just hold onto it till I get back. - You got it. - Thanks. Have a safe trip. A plane ticket to go to Bangkok? Are you out of your mind? - We need an interview. - With who? - The Canadian drug dealer. - You wanna call Louise yourself, ask her for a budget to go to Thailand? 'Cause I ain't doing that, pal. Give me two days over there and I'll come back with a Globe and Mail exclusive - that looks like a national scandal. - Wait, wait... It'll be huge, above the fold, front page. - Hold on. - Then hit her with the budget. When did this easy paycheck feature become a national scandal? Don't blame me if I'm the only guy here who can see through police bullshit. I didn't even start asking the guy the real questions - when he hit me with a line of "no comment"... - Fine, you've got a hunch. Do like everyone else in the newsroom... make the calls, pull the clippings, - check computer databases... - I checked with all of my sources. No one's ever heard of this huge drug kingpin, and nobody knows anything about this pipeline of heroin - that's coming into the country. - I don't have five grand to put on this, so... Wait a minute. Did the feds call you? Are you on their payroll now? Is that what's going on? Get into my office! Yeah, all right. Come on, relax, Art. You know how I get when I find something juicy like this. - You wanna go? - Yeah. I'm paying for your trip. But if you don't come back with a front-page story, you're gone. - Okay. - Okay? Louise will never publish anything from you again. Got it. Thanks, Art. Hmm. Pigging down already, Picker? You guys are the ones that are 45 minutes late. Two coffees, please. Can we have this all on one check? And, um, they're paying. - Of course. - Thanks. That ass! Get me a fork and knife, right? Well, you guys must be humping some dry ice if you're sitting here with me, huh? How's the fishing business? Great. Lately, I've been fishing in international waters. A lot of big fish out there. What do you mean by "international"? How do you guys feel about the term "Golden Triangle"? You know people in Thailand? You know what? I think I'm barking up the wrong tree. This is too big for you guys. What are we talking about here, Picker? We're talking about international players. We're talking about 99% pure H from Thailand to BC. Most importantly, we're talking about you guys paying me more than my normal source fee. You're saying you can get this guy for us? No. I'm saying I got this guy. Pleasure doing business. Do you speak French? Yeah. Cool. Is this everything? Yes, it's all there. If Glen needs something else, where can he reach you? I have this number. Well, that's my number. OK. Thanks. Hey, uh... I thought you didn't want to work with this guy, uh... Picker. He came to us with this. The target is importing from Thailand. Well, this Léger character seems like a big fish. Comes out of the system as Code A. He's connected. Criminal records show he's tied to the Hells. Why, uh... Why don't you walk me through this thing, okay? Like, break it down into boxes for me. What's the outcome box? - Do you see yourself taking down this target in Thailand? - No. We collect the evidence under the auspices of the Thai police, and we participate in the buy. Léger goes home. The outcome box: We arrest Léger at Vancouver Airport. All right, Sergeant. I'm gonna go ahead and authorize the operation, but the maximum the source can get is 80 grand. Plus expenses. - I'll talk to Picker. - Good. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm sorry, Mr. Malarek. I cannot allow you in, sir. All right, look. We both know Canadian citizens are allowed to visit Canadian inmates. And that's a Canadian passport, so... The passport is not a problem, but I cannot let you in. Why the hell not? Have a nice day, sir. Hello, Mr. Malarek? I'm Jim Raiven, the embassy's federal agent in Thailand. - How can I help you? - Uh, I'm here in Bangkok to see, uh, a Canadian prisoner you guys arrested, and I went to the prison, and... This case is still under investigation, Mr. Malarek, as I'm sure my colleague in Toronto told you. Did the embassy put me on a blacklist at Bombat prison? I suggest you read the press release on Operation Goliath - like everyone else, Mr. Malarek. - You know what? I've been here many times. I know how the system works. I know the embassy doesn't have any right... Have a nice day, Mr. Malarek. Hello? Fuck. All right. What happens when Glen finds out you did the whole bag? Fuck him. He's off on some trip while I'm busting my ass. De toute façon, we're partners now, baby. What's his is mine, and what's mine is his. All right, then. There's a phone ringing. Yeah? Why don't you answer the phone? Hey, man! How's your trip? I'm stuck in Jamaica, but I'm coming back tomorrow. I need you to pick me up at the airport. What are you doing in Jamaica? That's none of your business. Your business is to pick me up tomorrow at 9:00. - Oh, and, Danny Boy. - Yeah? Answer the phone when I fucking call, okay? Thank you for the signed copy of your book. My wife, she's so proud. You're welcome. I'm here with The Globe. I'm writing an article on an Operation Goliath. Have you heard of it? The Canadian drug dealer who was arrested. Exactly. The prison manager won't let me in to see him. - Why not? - I was hoping you could tell me that. The Canadian police seem to have restricted my access. You should see my friend Jim Raiven at the Canadian embassy. - I'll get you in touch. - Sergeant Jim Raiven? You know him? He's a Canadian officer. He doesn't have the power to decide whether or not I see a prisoner here in Bangkok. You're a good friend, Victor. But the Thai police has a special relationship with your country. My hands are tied. I-I must ask that you go through Jim Raiven. Okay. But my readers are gonna be very confused. - What do you mean? - When I write about this, they're gonna want to know how a Canadian sergeant was able to order around General Suchart of the Royal Thai Police on his own soil. You cannot write that. Cooper? - We're a go. - How much? Your end is 60. Are you fucking kidding me? I get 40 for delivering lowlifes. Call me when you have a serious offer. How much do you want? One hundred. I'll give you 80. Forty now, 40 when Léger goes down. - For that price, I'm gonna need expenses. - Sure. But the deal is effective only if you can start before the end of the month. Fine. Hey, guys. Come over here. Hey, how's it going? Beautiful day, huh? I was just talking to my wife. My wife, pregnant. I'm gonna be a father. Padre. - Papá. - Yeah! Hey, will you celebrate with me? Come have a cigar. Please. - Trabajo. - Come on, come on. Por favor. Léger is gonna be target number one on the priority scale of the month, coast to coast. We're gonna be the only international undercover operation approved so far. If we nail it, we are gonna get the biggest budget the division will spend this year. Are you saying we're going to Thailand? We're going to Thailand! - Can you take off your coat? Take off your coat. - No, no. I want my wife to know that I'm having a good time. Come on. "Celebrate-io." Okay, now come here. All right. Look mean. Yeah. All right, that's good. Beat it. Got it. Oh, my God! I wish you were there. It was fucking crazy. I was at this party. It was insane. These fucking women were so beautiful. And I got in an argument with this fucking nigger. He's fucking threatening me, so I take a Magnum .45 and I stick it right here. Look! Right here. He's all quiet. Look at this. See that guy? That's a motherfucking Colombian drug lord. This guy is so fucking powerful and my friend now. He makes so much fucking money. And so will we. Daniel. Where'd you put the package I asked you to pick up? Oh, I didn't think it was safe on the boat with the clients, so I'm, uh, keeping it at a friend's house. - Go get it. - Yeah. I got people who want to buy it. Yeah, of course. Ah! - He was robbed? - Yeah. Fucking kicked his ass, but he swears he doesn't have it anymore. What's his name? Doesn't matter. He got robbed. - You're so full of shit. - I'm telling you. Yeah, I'm telling you to tell your friend he owes me 1,000 bucks. And every day he's late, 40 points interest. 400 a day? - He can't afford it? - Fuck no! Well then, he better find that thousand real quick. Jesus. - Yeah? - Hey. Dave Miller scooped you. - What? - Yeah, he met with your guy already. It'll be in The Sun tomorrow. Well, did you read the article? No, not yet. But it doesn't matter 'cause we don't have the exclusive anymore. I just threatened the general in charge of the Thai Narcotic Suppression Bureau to get in to see this guy. - I know, but... - I'm writing my fucking article. You can put it on the front page or not. Just stay close to your fax. Oh, and how much for this? No, don't need the helmet. Why are you selling this? You need cash? No, I just don't like it anymore. We can't pay more than $50. It's an antique. It was my grandfather's. Then maybe you shouldn't sell it. Where's your bike? This looks light. $350. This doesn't even cover the interest. Keep my tips for the next month. Jesus, would you give me a fucking break? I gave you a place to stay. I gave you a motherfucking job. When you felt like shit, I gave you the best dope in BC. I know, but every t... Don't "but" me! I don't want "but," "if," "please." And no bullshit! Business is business. Look, I fucked up, okay? I'm sorry. I trusted you. Now I need all that trust shit built back up. Here's the deal. You do this thing for me, I'll forget about your $1,000 mistake. Yeah, okay. You got it. I was gonna do this myself, but... I don't know if I have time to figure out all the angles. And since you've done this shit before, maybe I should bring you in. I'm with you, man. What happened to you? - You can't pay for protection? - What? Aren't you this huge fucking drug lord or something? - Smoke? - Yeah. All right, listen. Somehow, I convinced my paper to send me down here to interview this criminal mastermind who managed to get himself locked up, but, see, I don't think he's a criminal mastermind. Yeah? Why not? Because everyone who knows him says the same thing. "Daniel Léger is just a lowlife junkie who lies like he breathes, and his only point in life is to get fucked up." My gut tells me that there's some thick bullshit being served up on you in this operation. But I don't know if what you're gonna tell me is bullshit or not too, so I'm under the assumption that everything is bullshit. So you can either tell me what the fuck really happened or you can squander this precious opportunity and serve up more of what I'm really good at smelling. Anyone ever call you a prick? Yeah. But most people call me Victor. Did Vic the Prick bring his tape recorder? Yeah. Got this one! I got this one! Why did they want to meet here? Everybody can see us. I don't know. Who gives a shit? Showtime. Nice car. Just answer their questions. Don't talk too much. Let's go. Uh, Picker here, he tells us that, uh, you've been to Thailand. I've been all over. Yeah? Right. But we're looking for a source in Thailand. Easy. I-I mean, uh, a source in Thailand ain't that hard to come by. Every fucking tuk-tuk driver's a source, you know? Yeah, um, don't know if you want to be asking a tuk-tuk driver for ten kilos, though. Well, you might be surprised. No, we're not looking for surprises. Bottom line, Daniel is happy to go over to Thailand and find you a source for whatever you need. Yeah? Okay. Well, what kind of deal could you get us? Uh, over there, uh, $10,000, $12,000. A kilo? I mean, fuck the price, guys. How the hell are you gonna get ten kilos into the country? 'Cause my asshole doesn't stretch that much. No one's gonna ask you to fit ten kilos in your ass. All right. We'll be in touch. Take care. Take care. Jesus Christ. You tell them $10,000 for a kilo? Fuck that. You said they wanted a source. You didn't say a goddamn thing about me going to Thailand. You bought tons of heroin in Thailand. I bought it over two months and I smoked it all there. - What? - Yeah! How the hell do you want me to go to Thailand? I don't have any cash. I-I don't fucking know. But you're going. And you're gonna find them a source. Do not make me look bad in front of these people, or I will fucking skin you alive. How much do you make at the store? Did you make enough to save some? Why? You still need money? No. I was just thinking... What do you say we get out of here? You mean like a vacation? Yeah, like a long one. Where? I don't know. Thailand? Right, I want to go to Thailand with my addict boyfriend. Are you out of your mind? Besides, I don't even have a passport. - I don't have a passport. - So fucking get one. I can't. The government revoked it when I got back from Thailand the last time. The embassy lent me $500 to pay airfare back to Canada. I can't get my passport back until I pay them. Are you trying to back out of this? Do you know how much money you fucking owe me? What do you mean, he doesn't want to go? He's making up bullshit excuses. I think he knows you guys are cops. Yeah? Well, I think your international player is a fucking moron high on crack who doesn't know a kilo from a carrot. He was testing you, Cooper, and you failed. You clowns drive in like fucking Vancouver Vice. Luckily, I was there to tell him it's all cool. So, you think this guy is for real? 100%. Well, then, why don't you convince him that we're serious? No, no, no, no. You convince him. I found this motherfucker. Now it's time for you to motivate him. You're early. Oh, you remember Frank. Frank and his associate are taking the boat this weekend. - She ready to go? - Yeah. Let me, uh, grab my stuff, and I'll jump off. Adams is in with the first shot. And here's MacDonald coming in. Going around, trying to wrap it around the net. And he falls to the ice. Coming back to center ice. Allô? You have a collect call from... Hi, Dad! It's me. It's Daniel. Do you accept the charges? That was on the boat. Where's the other guy? - He didn't get off with him? - No. Well, then how the fuck should I know? Did he kill him? Would you shut the fuck up? Sit down. Look, all I know is that fucker tried to play Frank. Frank asked to use the boat. Gave me a lot of money to use it, so... This is bullshit. I want out. A little late for that, my friend. So, you're saying you never would have come here to do a dope deal - if they hadn't threatened to kill you. - That's what I'm saying. But you came to Thailand to do a dope deal before. I came here on vacation with my buddy Michael. I didn't come here to buy. You were never a dope dealer? I'm a junkie, man. I'm guilty of that. I admit it. - But that's it. - All right. But you said that you couldn't come here because of passport issues and money problems. But you're here right now. Because they paid for it. Who paid for it? Those guys. The federal agents. They paid for everything. They bought you a plane ticket? Plane ticket, hotel, food, expenses, everything. Hey, think you could spare a few bahts? They make us pay for our food in this shit hole. - Yeah. - But you need to sign it up under my name before you leave. It gives me credit to buy stuff at the shop. Sorry, one minute. One minute? - Please? Listen, when is your trial? - A few months. I don't know. Okay, you need to plead guilty no matter what they say, okay? Otherwise, the drug-dealing charges are gonna put you on death row. It doesn't matter what the truth is. Plead guilty. Hey! Back off! They want the cigarettes I just gave you, plus five more every week. I gotta find some cash. I don't have a choice. Always have choice, okay? Okay. Well, I choose not to get beat to death. In the yard later, behind the kitchen, you see Tuan. He high. Not working. Daddy is very rich. He give you money. - Can I help you? - I'm just pulling this out of my ass, but you don't happen to be Sergeant Jim Raiven? - Charming. - Are you staying at this hotel? Just making sure you're safe during your stay in Bangkok, Mr. Malarek. I'm deeply moved that my government is looking out for me. You managed to get into Bombat prison? Maybe. Daniel Léger is a drug addict and a compulsive liar. Can't trust anything he says. Finally. Something I can use from a government official. Thank you. You know what? What if I found out that you guys paid for Léger's trip down to Thailand? What would you have to say about that? If I were you, Mr. Malarek, I'd be very careful before I print anything about this case. Or what? Step back from the vehicle. Don't want you to get hurt. It's okay. Shh. Can I use your fax? Cigarettes? No! No cigarettes. Hey, come on! I don't have them. Hey, hey. Hey! No, no! Hey, hey, hey! Leave him alone, okay? Ah! Khun tay! - And where are they now? - A hotel. Victor, Anna was scared shitless. We tried calling you, but there was no answer. Where are you? I'm at the airport. In Toronto? Nope, Bangkok. Jesus Christ. I'll be home tomorrow. Anyone read the news? The DEA in Seattle are making us look like nothing is moving over here. So I want updates, starting with Goliath. Sergeant Cooper. Our, uh, players are all lined up. That's the exact same answer you gave me last week. Okay, I'm pulling Fountain to prep Johnson's Operation Black Hawk team in case Goliath goes south. Frank, what the hell is taking Goliath so long? Target disappeared. What? Shit. Picker doesn't know where he went. We gotta replace Denis fast. Dubé's not gonna spend another dime. I'm gonna use another department's budget. What department? Training. You're not seriously thinking about bringing Al in, are you? I need an asshole. This section deals with sexual offenses and deals with consent, no defense.

Cadet, we are giving you an opportunity for some in-the-field training. Operation Goliath needs a new man. This would not be paid work and would require you to take makeup classes when... I'm in. - You're interested? - Fuck yeah. All right, let me make one thing perfectly clear right now. Any bullshit, any improvisation or deviation from my orders will result in a strict, official reprimand to your superiors. Do you understand? I won't let you down, Dad. Khun tay! Khun tay! Psst! You did good today. I gotta disagree on that. Hey, what does, uh... khun tay mean? - Khun tay? - Yeah. Khun tay. Khun tay means, "You're dead." Shit. Who's this new guy? Denis is out. Al's in. - He knows the story? - Which story is that? The one where you said you had a huge player on the line that tries to stick us for travel costs and then does a Houdini? I don't have him in a fucking cage. Get in. Guess what. A cage is exactly what you're in until you find this prick. - Here you go, baby. - Thanks. - You all right? - Yeah. - Hey, Norm. - Hi. Hello! Oh, my God. - You're a lifesaver, man. - I got it. My pleasure. So they can't find us here? Trust me. This is so much better than a hotel. - Just stay with Norm. He'll be with you till I get back, okay? - Okay. - I love you. - I love you too. Well, what's this? Where's this gonna go? Put that down. Where the hell is my story? Hey. When did you get in? Léger told David Miller to go fuck himself. The Sun didn't get the article. I did. I delivered. Where the fuck is my front page, Art? Your junkie pal made some pretty serious accusations. And, you know, it could blow up in our face. Excuse me? The government can wipe its ass with an innocent victim, and we're not gonna report on it because, what, the victim's a junkie? Is that what's going on here? Well, he robbed a gas station. What? He robbed a gas station. So, I don't know. He's not as innocent as you might think. - Oh, he robbed a gas station? - Yeah. So that gives the federal police the right to leave him in Thailand to get the death penalty. That makes a lot of fucking sense. Meanwhile, they can cover up their colossal clusterfuck because the media is sitting here sucking its collective dick all because the victim's not a nice guy? Would you just relax? Did I say I wasn't gonna run the story? No. I'm having it checked first, all right? Why are you making this thing personal? Lawyer's at 3:00. Make the necessary cuts. It'll run tomorrow, all right? On Page 5? Below the fold? No follow-up? Everyone moves on? Meanwhile, a Canadian citizen is executed in a fucking third-world country, and we're not gonna do a fucking thing about it, Art? I'm sorry. You know how you gave me my first story? You made me the journalist I am today. I never thanked you for that. Can you have somebody just put my stuff in a box? - I'll pick it up tomorrow. - Come on, Vic. No, you guys aren't into my stuff anymore. I should have heard you when you said it last week. - Hey. - Hi. Um, I'm a friend of Daniel's, and I know you guys know each other, and I'm looking for him, but I don't know where he is. Do you know where I can find him? No. So you're telling me you don't know him? No, I'm telling you I have no idea where he is. Oh. All fucking and no talking, huh? Wow. Would you be my girlfriend? All right. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. How's your little side business going? Danny! Why does he want to see me? 'Cause he's the boss. He says he wants to meet you. Hop in. Frank and Glen have told me great things about you, Daniel. Really? The way we see it, this works out, could become a regular deal. See, we're looking to expand our operations in Thailand. We'd like you to help us out. Well, Don, I'd... I'd really like to help you... but I-I can't afford to go to Thailand. Hmm? Well, how'd you get the money for the train ticket? I spent everything I had on it. Well, you know... from now on, I'm taking care of everything. Flight, hotel, expenses, the whole shebang. No more fucking around, kid. You're going to Thailand. Well, what about my passport? Don't worry. Al took care of it. We fast-tracked it. Ready to be picked up. Yeah, we even got you a hotel room right next to the airport. You're going to Thailand tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Daniel. It's just a couple of days. Quick in and out. - Thanks, Daniel. - Yeah. All right, let's go. Come on. And I challenge the Democrats to stand up on this point. They say this is a war. Then treat it as such. We've got to fight the drug war on all four fronts at once. Shrinking the supply by destroying crops and labs and by patrolling our borders vigorously, increasing both the certainty and the severity of punishment... If you sell drugs, you will be caught. And when you're caught... Norm. This stuff is gold. Did you know that the DEA might have been pressuring the BC police to get results? I mean, if we can find out what the US quota system is... - Victor, listen. - What? I've been reassigned to another project. That's just gonna have to wait, man. Well, apparently, it can't. Look, I-I love this junkie story too, but Randy doesn't want me to work on it, so... The Globe paid for half of our investigation. It doesn't make any sense to take our foot off the gas now. If we just go to BC, we dig a little bit, we're... Victor, Randy wants to see you. Come in. Have a seat. Victor, I've got to let you go. I thought you said that the show was kicking ass since I got here. Yeah. I don't have a choice. It's budget cuts. You know I left The Globe and Mail, right? Yeah, I know. This doesn't have anything to do with the junkie investigation, does it? No, no. Nothing at all to do with the federal police or anything like that? It's got nothing to do with that. Yeah. Yeah, it'll be fine. Yeah. No, no. It's not a question of the space. Look at this. Yeah. No, no, space is fine. That's not an issue. It's the, uh... It's the, uh... Hang... No, hang on a second. Victor, a call for you. One second, Bianca. So, uh, what did he want? Uh... I got fired. What? Why? I'm not sure. - Yeah? - Uh, Mr. Malarek. I'm calling from the Public Complaints Commission. Complaints Commission? I've never heard of you. Yeah, we're a new entity. Listen. I just read your article on the Daniel Léger case. I'd like to discuss it with you. I don't work for The Globe anymore. In fact, I don't work for anyone. So I won't be doing any follow-ups. No, I-I'm not calling to give you information, Mr. Malarek. I think maybe I'd like to make this our first case. I need the details of your investigation. All right, stop. Oh, hey, buddy. How are you doing? Good. Come on in. Relax. Flight leaves tomorrow. Frank will call you with the exact time. And make sure he's on the fucking plane. Don't worry. He'll be there. Do you mind if we stay here a couple more days? No, sure. What? I need to go to Montreal. - Why? - Uh... I need to speak to the Complaints Commission about the federal police. You're making a complaint against the feds? No, the Complaints Commission read my article in The Globe, and they want to talk to me about the Daniel Léger case. Well, what have you got to do with that? Well, I interviewed him, so they want me to testify as a witness. I'm gonna go check on the meat loaf. You lost both your jobs because of this thing. Don't you think it's time to just drop it? I'm not gonna drop it now. - We just put our finger on something... - No, you... I have never complained about your work. Okay? I am proud of what you do. I have always been proud. But you've got to drop this thing. Well, this isn't my job. This is a court investigation. These people attacked us. To be fair, we don't know who attacked us. They weren't trying to hurt you. They were trying to scare me, as usual. We can't let these guys change the way we live our lives just because... Oh, my God. - What? - It obviously doesn't matter what I say. Of course it matters what you say. It's just that Léger is out there on his own. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Leave him out there to rot? Come on. You can't save everybody. You have a daughter now. What if it was our daughter, hmm? - Out there. - It's not. Well, what if it was, and she was dying in a Thai prison, and the government had abandoned her? Like you are? This whole thing isn't about Léger or our daughter. It's about you. But this guy isn't you. Okay? When Social Services took you away, you were a kid. You were innocent. This guy's a criminal, for Christ's sake. The government fucked him over. I know what it feels like to have the shit kicked out of you every day and to wonder if anybody is ever gonna come look out for you. No one ever does. I hope you guys are hungry. It's comfort food. Usually, it gets a bigger ovation when I arrive with a meat loaf. Our first big point in this semifinal match. It becomes balletic. That is McEnroe magic at its best. And that's a tough spot to hit, trying to get it into that corner, the forehand of his opponent. Dude, I didn't touch your cash! I swear! Forget about that. That's not why I'm calling. Who's your dealer in Bangkok? Porn? What? Porn. Guy's name is Porn. He drives a tuk-tuk. Go to the Porn Hotel. You fucking with me? No, his name is Porn. The tuk-tuk stand is in front of the Porn Hotel. And this guy can sell me 10 kilos out of his tuk-tuk? 10 kilos? Fuck no. But he can find them for you. Show him that picture of us at the titty beach at Koh Samui. You still got that photo? I think so. Show it to him. He'll remember me. And tell him about Richard. He's a client I introduced. He was smuggling heroin out of the country in his prosthetic leg. The guy's missing a leg! You're not gonna believe this. I asked for Léger's mug shot for the cash request on the drug transaction. - Yeah. - C Division sent me this. What the hell is that? Robert Léger. We've been working off the wrong record. No, I don't know. Our guy changes his first name all the time. I've seen a long list. Besides, the birth date's a match. Right. The name matches. The date and location of birth matches. The mug shot doesn't. Well, C Division sent the wrong photo. No, that's unlikely. I'll take care of it. So, what's the story on this? Well, Daniel Léger exists in the Social gSecurity data bank. - Mm-hmm. - He's got a driver's license. He's from Quebec, but he's got no criminal record. Hmm. And Robert Léger? Robert Léger and Daniel Léger are two different people. And, uh, Robert Léger is the fellow with the criminal record. Okay. Thanks. Excuse me. Do you know a Mr. Porn? Tuk-tuk driver, Mr. Porn? Over there? Thanks. Are you, uh, Mr. Porn? Go sit with Al for a bit. Yeah. Can't sleep? I just hope we didn't forget anything. Did you get all the transaction cash we wanted? I got 60 grand. What about the mug shot problem? Did you fix it? Everything is so screwed up in Archives. I had to take the surveillance pic of Léger and stick it in the file. Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute. So, we don't know if we have the wrong criminal record? Well, did you call Quebec? I didn't have time. Oh, Jesus Christ. That means it's possible our guy doesn't even have a record. Well, who cares what he did or he didn't do before? What we're after is what he's doing right now. And right now, he's in Thailand, working for us. There. - My friends. - Morning. Welcome to Thailand. These are fine men, Sergeant Cooper. They'll be happy to assist you during your operation. Oh, that's great. We're gonna need your men on scene as backup. As soon as the transaction is complete, we leave Thailand and make our arrest in Canada. You arrest your local source. How will you convict the trafficker if he's not in possession when you arrest him? No, he'll be in possession. We're gonna arrest him at Vancouver Airport once he gets his cut. I see. But, Sergeant Cooper, I'm afraid that's not possible. Yeah, why? We can't allow any illegal narcotic leaving our shores, even if it is by Canadian police. - What, higher? - Yeah. That's good. We gotta talk. - All right. - Yeah. I didn't speak directly to the colonel, - but the other guy said it'd be fine. - Oh, wait. - You didn't think to check on Thai narcotics law? - What for? - Because we're doing the fucking operation in Thailand. - Shut up, Al. - Don't tell me we're packing up. - Oh, come on. No. We're not packing up. We are gonna arrest Léger here, in Bangkok. Frank, we do that, we are never getting Léger out of Thailand. Bullshit. He's our suspect. We can do what we want with him. Fuck the Thai government. Then we make it look like an escape. Our guy gets away from us, he flies back to Canada,... Do you know what the fuck you're talking about? Fuck yourself, fat man! Okay, let's go. Come on in. You're early. Everything all right? Yeah, well, body clock is all fucked up. Yeah? This is my friend Porn. Porn. Dig your name, man. Porn, this is, uh, Frank, Al and Don. Well, come in, come in. - You want a beer? - No, I'm good. Thanks. I'll, uh, leave you guys to discuss. Oh, no. No, we need you as an interpreter. Oh, he... he speaks English. Well... I think it's best if you stay. All right, I'll take that beer then. All right, so, uh, Daniel here, - he tells us that you can help us out. - Thanks. Yeah. Okay, how much for a kilo? Thirteen. We'll give you nine. How many? Kilos? Ten. Five for ten. Five for ten... I think he means five kilos at $10,000 each. Do you have, uh, $50,000 here? Oh, yeah, you betcha. You want to count it? Oh, uh... I believe you guys. Porn, you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, where do you wanna do this? You have to meet my sister. Maybe you gotta marry her as part of the deal. My sister will decide where to do this, or no deal. Well, see, we've got the money. So, uh, we'll decide, or no deal. Happy to meeting you. Hey, Porn, come on. Porn! Hey! What kind of half-ass stunt was that? Is this what we came here for, to meet this small-time loser? If this deal goes south... it ain't gonna end good for you, I'll tell you. Daniel, relax. We'll be fine. Besides, you, uh, you got two days to make this deal happen, right? Uh-huh. I'll be back tomorrow. I love you. Yeah. Hey, Porn. I don't like this place, man. Let's just go back and convince your sister, all right? My sister's out. She don't trust your friend. She didn't even meet them. Yeah, she go to sit in the hotel and look at them. And she said they were police. Well, your sister's got a problem, 'cause they're not police. Don't be scared. This is a safe place here. Come to see my friend. Good friend, okay? Can I ask you something? Where the fuck did you guys find this junkie-ass loser? I think he's full of shit too. Right? Who's full of shit? No, I'm asking you. Who's full of shit? The junkie asshole. He just... He doesn't feel right. He doesn't feel right? That's good police work. Is that what they teach you at the academy? They teach us to trust our gut. Let me tell you something. E Division, they gave us a million-dollar budget for this operation. Now, does your gut want to be part of a team that spends that kind of budget and brings back zero results? Boulder? - No, sir. - So, we follow the junkie asshole's lead, and everyone shut the fuck up. Nipa and Pimpan? Porn got these girls? They can do it outside, in an alley next to an old cinema. How much can they get? - Two kilos. - Christ. Are you fucking kidding me? We didn't come all this way to Thailand - for two goddamn kilos. - Hey, if you can do better, go ahead. All right, look, our flight leaves tomorrow. Can they do the deal tonight? This is, uh... Nipa and, uh, Pimpan. Jesus. How old are they? Fucking Asians. Who knows? We go? - Have they got it? - Yeah, they have it. No worries. Is this it? We getting off here? Who's this? My brother. My brother have it. You go and see it, yeah? No, no. Daniel, tell him to get off the bike. I don't know them any more than you do. All right, tell him to get off the bike. Al, get in the back. We're gonna do the deal in the truck. Come on, tell him to get off the bike. I'm not gonna risk him tearing off down the street. In the back. All right, open the bag. - No, you show money. - Open the bag first. - You need to show money first. - I need to see what's in the bag. - Hey, show money now! - No, hold your horses. - You see the drugs? - Open the fucking bag! Give me! - Show me the bag! - Don't touch it. Don't move. Officer assistance! - Hey! - Hey, James, he's coming at you! - Al! - Don't fucking move! Stop the truck! Stop! - Stop! - We are police! Police! Stop! Holy... Shots fired! Man down! Okay. Stop the truck! Stop! Jesus Christ. Man down! Man down! Check him. Check him, check him! Call an ambulance! Man down! You okay? Yeah, I'm all right. We'll be right back. Look, I know this accident was terrible, but we need to move now if we want to stay in front of this. - What? - If what really happened here reaches the public, you're all fucked. And so am I. This is Norman. Leave a message. Norman... I changed my flight. I'm coming home tonight. Uh, take the girls with you to the studio, will you? I... Just keep them safe till I get back. Thanks. Mr. Malarek? We're ready for you. Ma'am, what's he saying? He said you were... The policemen's stories contradict. They are bringing in someone to give the official version of the arrest. What? I may swear to God all my statement will be true. I swear. Mr. Malarek. Robert McDonald. - Thanks for coming in. - Yeah. - This way. - Glad I could be here. Mr. Léger was convicted of assault, possession of narcotics and importation and trafficking of narcotics in Canada. He was to receive, um, 10% of the drugs and I believe $5,000... Your Honor, there's something I wish I could tell the court. This Canadian operation in Thailand was illegal. According to Canadian law, the Canadian police did not have the right to pay for my plane ticket for me to come here and do this job for them. And... They paid for everything. The plane tickets, the hotels, expenses, everything. - Daniel Léger told you this? - Yes. Why would the federal narc agents do that? They know it leads directly to illegal entrapment. You'll have to ask them. All I know is Léger didn't have enough cash for rent. He didn't even have a bank account. And more importantly, Your Honor, the police from my country lied to you in this court and to the Thai police when they came here. They have said that I have a criminal record, which is not true. And I'm sure... I've been an investigative journalist for 15 years. I make a few phone calls, I find out if someone is connected. What I found out on Léger is unanimous. He's a small-time junkie. In our country's criminal world, he's a nobody. And I can get proof of that! If I'm allowed to contact my country's authorities, I'm sure I can get a letter confirming that I do not have a criminal record. Laos, Myanmar and Thailand export over 200 metric tons of heroin each year. Operation Goliath ended up stopping a transaction of two kilos. So, yes, it's possible the Thais would set up a tiny sting like this. But in my opinion, it's completely ridiculous. They made threats to me. But, Your Honor, I have to... Do you think he could've organized this transaction? Yeah. In the case number 635412, Thailand v. Daniel Léger, Judge Wanian finds the defendant guilty of co-possession, along with Nipa Seangtong, Pimpan Seangtong and Pracha Seangtong, of more than 200 grams of heroin. Therefore, the defendant's sentence is death by execution. The court will now give the defendant a chance to change his plea. Does the defendant wish to change his plea? Yes. What is your plea? Guilty. The sentence is therefore changed to 100 years of imprisonment. You've done a good thing, Mr. Malarek. Without you, Léger wouldn't stand a chance against those guys. And he stands a chance now? Those officers broke nearly every procedure and regulation there is. Let's hope you can move fast. The average prisoner doesn't last 10 years in there. Half of that for a Westerner. This is my priority. - Thanks, man. - Yeah. Take care. Good luck! Hey. Uh, she's... she's gone. What do you mean, she's gone? I-I got your message and came home, but there was no one here. She... Sh-She's gone. Anna? Hello? Denise, put Anna on the phone, please. She's not here. Do you know where she is? - No. - Don't fuck with me, Denise. If you know where she is, I need to know now. All right? - I'm really scared that something's happened to them. - She'll call you. Happy see you. Yeah, bet you are. What are those? Guard left them for you. This is from my mother. Those fuckers kept these from me? What's this? "Public Complaints Commission." They're investigating my case back home. Holy shit! They're coming here to see me. Lucky. Lucky you. Shit, shit, shit. I need to sign this form against the federal police and send it back to them. Need contact in mail room. Yeah, no shit. I'm fucked! I don't have any money for a contact. Already got good contact. Who? In the yard. Back, back, left. Behind the kitchen. You see Tuan. He high, not working. Tuan. The junkie. He delivered this? Holy shit, you fat-ass Buddhist motherfucker. Mmm. Hello? Anna? Anna, is that you? Okay, sweetheart, I know you don't want to talk to me right now, and I... I get it. I, uh... I just... You and our daughter come first. I don't care about TV shows or newspapers or investigations or anything else nearly as much as I care about you two. Let me prove that to you. And then, and only then... maybe you'll let me save the world. Maybe just a little, itty-bitty part of the world. Anna? We're at my sister's. I knew that. Are you coming? Right away. Can I come in? Go ahead. Daniel! Is this it? You think? Open it! I'm going home, brother! I'm so happy for you! Okay, I think I'm ready. Right around here? Make sure you get as much of the background as possible. Can you count me in? Three, two, one. It's a big day for Daniel Léger, the Canadian man who was wrongly accused of smuggling heroin in Thailand in 1989. His plane landed on home soil just a few moments ago. He was escorted off by officers, who will then accompany him to a Canadian prison, where he will finally be released on parole. Léger, who beat his heroin addiction on his own, was able to mount a defense against the federal government from his cell in Bangkok by gathering thousands of documents through the public access to government information in Ottawa. Léger was able to secure himself a transfer to serve his time in his country. Actually, right now, Daniel Léger is being brought from the terminal. In on him. Welcome home, Mr. Léger. Thank you. I notice that no one is here to meet you. I, uh... I lost both my parents while I was in prison. Ah. I'm really sorry to hear that. Hey, guys, do you mind just giving us two seconds? Two seconds, please? Thank you. Uh... It took great courage for you to be able to build your case from a prison cell in Bangkok. How did you manage to do that? Zen Buddhism. Do you know what happened to the federal police that, uh, that arrested you? - No, no idea. - No? They were given medals for their work on Operation Goliath and they were awarded desk jobs. How does that make you feel? I mean, do you feel like you've been cheated out of eight years of your life? Obviously, there's no words that can describe - what Daniel Léger is... - Grateful. You ask me how I feel. I feel grateful. Thank you, Victor. Did you get that? And cut.
