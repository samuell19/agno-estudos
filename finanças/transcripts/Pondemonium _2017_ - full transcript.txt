Hey Joe, I just came up with the most brilliant idea ever! Come on Joe, you're almost there! I once broke open a hard piece of cheese by dropping it. And bang, it just cracked opened. Come on, give it a shot. Right. (GRUNTING) Huh? Oof! (BIRDS CHIRPING) (LAUGHS) So you want to crack this nut. You know, maybe this will work. Come on, tell us!

(SCREAMING) Big guy, are you all right? It's you, Cosmo. Of course it is. And what is this? The brave Joe Croaker is scared? No way. But seriously Cosmo, check out that guy over there. Oh, so that's who was bothering you, Joe. I thought you had more guts than that. Hey what are you talking about? I'm not afraid of that guy. I'm just being cautious, come on, you know I'm not afraid of him, don't you Cosmo? Really? Then prove to me you're not afraid. Go. Fine, I'll prove it. (GIGGLES) (WHIMPERS) Huh? Hey Joe, you have a plan, man? I know, how about we have a competition? Competition? Whoever gets closer to the big guy wins. So you scared? Do you forfeit? Scared? No way, you're on! I bet the guy isn't nearly as mean as he looks. Hey Joe, look, I'm touching him. Your turn. How was that? Not bad. Now check this out. I'm in his mouth. Impressed? Me? It takes a really special kind of brave to do this. Be quiet! (CHUCKLES) Yeah? Well I dare you to do that again. Alrighty! Ha ha Joe, you lost this one. Even if you press this last tooth, I'll still win 'cause I'll have one more than you, Joe. (LAUGHS) You cheated! Joe, I'm as honest as the day is long. And with that said, I retire. You can't retire! Don't touch that! (SCREAMING) Close one. Nearly took the whole thing. What just happened? I'm stuck In here! Oh no! I gotta think of a way out! You got stuck in there? Too bad. Joe, you know perfectly well I did. It's all your fault! You hear me, it's your fault! Okay, I'll get you out of there. Hold on a second! Come on, open. (GRUNTS) Joe Croaker, what are you doing? Quit messing around! You made him angry, now fix this mess! You let go right now! (GRUNTS) Huh? The jaw, the jaw's moving. Don't stop, Joe. It's stuck again, Joe. Ah, I got it now. Hold on there, Cosmo! (GRUNTING) I'll get you outta there! That's good news, Joe Croaker. I'm going crazy in here, hurry up! Whoa, what's that? Oh no! Oooo... What was that? I just broke this guy's tail off and he doesn't seem to mind. That only makes things worse. (SOBS) Maybe I'll never get out of here. (SOBBING) What's that? You don't have any faith in me, do you? That'll teach you to keep your mouth shut, Cosmo. (COSMO SOBBING) After all that. That's how he treats Joe Croaker? Have fun in there, stupid fly! I don't need you! Someone help! Hey Joe, you gotta come back! Oh Joe, please. Your crying means nothing to me. Nothing at all. I'll just go home and have a rest or two. (GRUNTING) Joe Croaker, hey Joe, come back and save me, Joe! Oh yeah. That's nice. Huh? This is... I remember this ice cream stamp. It's the one Cosmo gave me for my birthday. Those too. (LAUGHS) Thank you. Happy birthday! (LAUGHTER) Give it back, Joe! (WHIMPERING) I'm sorry! Oh my, I'm on my way! Cosmo! Cosmo! I'm gonna get you out! Is that Joe? Joe, you came back for me! Now don't worry, I'm gonna set you free. I'll get you out! I love you Joe, really. Let's go, Joe! Come on, Joe! Come on, Joe! (GROANING) Are you all right? I'm sorry, buddy. You're the bravest, most trustworthy friend I've ever had. Hey Joe, we're still good friends right? That's it! Best friends stick together! (GRUNTING) Joe, you're doing great! I finally got out, Joe! And it's all thanks to you! Well I only saved you because I wanted to bully you like before. (LAUGHS) Yeah, sure, act tough as you want. I know deep down you're just a big softie. I am not! Hey everyone, Joe has a heart of gold! JOE: Cosmo, you didn't have to kiss me. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Are we sure the sound was coming from here? Oh yeah, I'm getting closer. Oh! Oh! Ah, oooo. What is it? Whoa! Oh! Huh? What is this green thingy? Oh yeah, it must taste delicious. It's weird. Tastes weirder. Oh. Ooooh. Yeah, there's candy inside of it. (GRUNTING) It's too hard!

Yeah, and it nearly scared me half to death! Harumph. It made me dizzy, my head was spinning. I ended up dropping my beloved pollen everywhere. How annoying! It's weird. Hey Flutterbye, do you reckon someone's playing a prank on us? Yes, someone must be behind all of this. Grrr! Well then I'll find him and sort him out! He'll pay the price! It's Joe Croaker! Right, Joe Croaker. He's got a hold of some wee green object. Every time he blows it, it gives this creepy sound. I was just pushing my dung ball uphill and he gave me an awful surprise with that wretched sound. And then I fell over. - Huh? - Huh? - Joe, you're toast! - Joe, you're toast! (SNORING) Look, he's there. That's the green thing, there. You're not getting away. Not with me here. I'll make you pay all right. (GRUNTING) (GASPS) He's awake! Quick, hide!

Like Flutterbye? Yup, she stares at herself every single morning. Now you're doing the same. Huh? Why you looking at me like that? Staring is kinda rude you know. I didn't mean it! Oh Bartle Bee, you're still doing it! Looking at me sideways like that. I'm outta here! Cosmo! Where should I put these flowers? Bartle Bee! Huh? Hey Bart! Hi! What can I help you with, Flutterbye? Hi there, I want to hang up these lovely flowers, maybe you can help me. Oh, sure. Fantastic! How is it? Does it look all right? Uh... Lower the right side. Now is it okay? Just a little lower. Now it's perfect. Thank you so much, Bartle Bee! My pleasure. Okay. Let's check this out. Oh? Why is it crooked? (GROANING) McBroom, what's bothering you, buddy? I wanna get this home, but there are parts in the road there. Look. See? Oh, wait, you can be my guide. All you do is tell me which way to roll. Keep going. Stay on the track, to the right, to the right! No no, to the left! Or maybe not. Make up your mind! Oh, to the right, to the right! Hurry up! To the right, right! Whoa! (SCREAMS) Sorry about that. I gotta go. I really don't understand what's wrong with Bartle Bee today. I know! He's gone totally crazy! We should string him up and hang him out to dry! Pronto!

Hey, you led me astray and I lost my dung ball. Hey you, why did you lie to me? It's not nice! You disrespected me! I did not! - You did! - You did! MCBROOM: It's all your fault! FLUTTERBYE: You're mean! (BUGS BICKERING) Stop it, please listen to me! - Eh? - Huh? Go on. Well I have a stiff neck! - Oh my. - Oh my. What is a stiff neck? Well it all started last night, I had a nice dream, but when I woke up I realized I was sleeping on my neck all wrong, it really hurts. That's why I see everything sideways and that's why I hurt your all. (LAUGHTER) Hey, this isn't funny! Honestly, I'm in a lot of pain! All right, Bartle Bee, I'll give you a massage now, okay? But, uh... Hey, trust me, Bartle Bee. I've got strong hands. McBroom, stop it! Just relax. You'll feel better once I'm finished. Please, let me go! (GASPS) (SCREAMS) (GROANING) His head's still tilted. Huh? (LAUGHTER) Go away! - Here we come! - Here we come! FLUTTERBYE: Tickle tickle tickle! (LAUGHTER) Please untie me! It's so tickely! Guys, come on, please stop, it's so tickely! Whoa! Did it work, did it work? (GROANING) FLUTTERBYE: Doesn't look like it. You guys really aren't helping. Since tickling didn't work, we'll have to try things Cosmo's way. (CHUCKLES) Bartle Bee. What is it? (SCREAMING) MCBROOM: The humanity! Stop screaming, I'm almost finished. Cosmo, let go of me! Cosmo, I'll get you! - Get back here! - Sorry, Bartle Bee! Cosmo! (GROANING) Hey, are you all right? My neck is all better! Yeah, fantastic-a-roonie! Oh Joe Croaker, thank you so much. How nice of you. Oh this is nothing, I can handle more, and even more. More and more and more, you betcha. As much as you like. Oh I know, you're fantastic. Such a champion. There we are, just lay it down here. And Joe, thanks again. No problem. It's always my pleasure. Oh you're great! I bet this gorgeous beauty's going to light up my whole place! Huh? (GRUNTING) This is too easy. I should probably double the dung and roll a bigger one tomorrow. Wow, McBroom is really strong! Ah! McBroom! Stop! Listen, you think you're a big guy, but I'm much stronger. Oh, I, well, I, uh... Never mind that. Let's have a competition. All right. You're on. Oh my! So I can prove my masculine strength, yeah! Oh my, I lost my train of thought. So will you be the referee? All right. Oh, I... I'll go first, okay? (GRUNTING) Oh! That's awesome. (CHUCKLES) Come on, McBroom! Yeah. So go on then. (LAUGHS) Oh? Oh! It's lighter than it looks. McBroom, you're outstanding! (STUTTERING) I was just getting ready. I haven't even started yet. Oh wow. You see that rock over there? Who's first? You! What, that thing? Mmmhm. (VOICEOVER) Getting cold feet, huh? It does looks heavy though. (LAUGHS) I really hope it don't crush him. (GRUNTING) Oh! Come on, you're up. Well then, if we're gonna do it, we'll do it like professionals. Why don't we go home and make a barbell or something heavy like that, then we can come back and have a rematch. What do you say? Oh, all right. I bet you're really scared now, McBroom. I am the master of the pond. - Huh? - Huh? (HUMMING) Oh! It's you! I can't believe it. He's stronger than I expected. What am I gonna do? Oh perfect. I'm ruined if I don't win. Oh come on, Joe! No way! I'm not gonna stand for this anymore! I'm king of the pond, McBroom. I'll have you! (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (GRUNTING) There's no way I'm gonna let you defeat me! Come on! Come on! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Oh? Oh! (GRUNTING) One, two, three... Seven, 16, 100!

Okay, your turn. Don't push yourself, you might get hurt. Light as a feather. Oh! (CHUCKLES) There's no way you could've lifted that, you must've cheated! Impressive, this round is a draw. That was just something to get started with. Let's double it, I'll go first. That looks heavy. Are you sure you can do it, Joe? Just wait and see. (GRUNTING) Wow, come on! Joe Croaker's the real champion. You eat my dust. - Oh! - Oh! (GRUNTING) Whoa! Hey! What's going on here? Hey Joe, are you all right? (SOBBING) I lost to a stupid, good for nothing bug? No, no! (COSMO HUMMING) Huh? What's that thing? Wow, it looks shiny. I'll check it out. What kind of sorcery is this? I've never seen anything like it. A round, bulbous tail? A big ol' belly? And look at that head. I should introduce myself. Hi there, I'm Cosmo. Wowee, you sure are a fragrant one. Have you been rolling around in the trash? Come on dung ball, keep a-rolling. Come on. What are you doing? Woo! What was that? The life of a fly. (GROANING) I don't feel so good. The smell of that stink bug's all over me. This is embarrassing. (SOBBING) Oh wonderful! That's where it's coming from. I gotta take a rest. How can I get rid of this smell? This is amazing! Bartle Bee, why are you circling me? Hey there, Cosmo. What are you doing? You smell great! Cosmo, I want to invite you to my place. Your place? But last week you said to never come back. Did I really? I didn't mean it. How about I give you some honey. Okay? Sure! Wait right there. What's wrong with Bartle Bee today? At least I get some free honey out of it. (HUMMING) (GIGGLES) Eh? Ah, what's that? (HUMMING) I can taste it already. Cosmo? My. Hi, Flutterbye. Cosmo, I find you exceptionally charming today. (CHUCKLES) Only today? Better late than never I guess, huh? Cosmo, let's go to my place for some nectar. Seriously? Flutterbye, you've never invited anybody to your house. Oh don't be silly, sure I do. Here, take this. Well aren't you sweet. I've got even more at my place. Come on, big boy. Okay! Huh? Come on, Cosmo. I'm coming. Wait! Cosmo, I brought you honey. You wanna go to my house, huh? Okay, sure! Bartle Bee, but Cosmo's already coming with me! But he agreed to come with me. I've got a nectar stash. And I've got honey. He's coming with me! With me! With me! With me! With me! Mama, and you said I'd never be popular. (LAUGHS) Cosmo, take this, let's go purify. Let's go to my place. Flutterbye! He's all mine! He's mine! He's mine! BARTLE: He's mine, he's mine! You're annoying! I'm outta here, and I'm taking these with me! It's been a long time since I've had honey as fine as this. Maybe I can get some more out of those two. FLUTTERBYE: Of course you can. (GIGGLES) Flutterbye? Eek! Why are you stalking me? This is kinda creepy. Cosmo. Gah! What are you trying to do to me? I'm sleeping this nightmare away. - Cosmo. - Cosmo. What? Cosmo, are you tired? We'll stand guard while you sleep, Cosmo. Well whatever. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (YAWNING) - Cosmo. - Cosmo. Hiya. Ah! When are you two bugs gonna leave my domicile? Cosmo, are you hungry now? We've brought some food. Lots of sugary pollen and honey. Oh wow! Eat up, Cosmo. My favorite! So do you think we could stay a little longer at your house? Whatever. - Oh yeah, oh yeah. - Mmmm... - Cosmo! - Cosmo! Hey Cosmo! Where are you going? That's enough! Come on, this is ridiculous, don't you think? About that, we're just fans. Come on, for you! You two, that wasn't even an answer! Cosmo, the thing is, I don't know if you're aware at all, but you smell super heavenly. It's true! Huh? Smells nice? Oh, now I remember. It was that stink bug that blasted me. That's why Flutterbye and Bartle Bee keep following me. Right, I gotta get rid of them. Hey, look out! - What? - What? - What is it, Cosmo? - What is it, Cosmo? Cosmo is gone. I know, what should we do now? Let's find him. Yes. (GRUNTING) (LAUGHS) I smell better now. Isn't that McBroom? I got it! Hey! Cosmo. Hey McBroom, tell me what I smell like. Wow, so good! You smell just like me wheel, man! That should just about do it. Cosmo? Cosmo? Hey! I'm over here, you guys! Cosmo! Come here, lovely friends. Hi! (LAUGHS) - We're coming! - We're coming! I'm waiting. (GIGGLING) (SCREAMING) Oh no, that stinks! That stinks! It's awful! Where you going? (CHUCKLES) Aha, we meet again at last. Listen, you better apologize... After I drop this off, I'm gonna roll an even bigger one! It got stuck again. Come on! Hey McBroom, don't do it! (GROANING) - Morning. - Morning. Wanna play, Cosmo? COSMO: Help me! (SNORING) Achoo!

Whoa! (GROANING) Oh my head. What's going on? Why's it so dark all of a sudden? (LAUGHING) Huh? Whoa, this is fantastic! We finally opened it. Oh yeah! The suspense is over.

My my, I'd like another one. But I don't know if I could find one. Hey McBroom, have you seen any sugary sweet tubes around here? Aye, looks perfect. Hey McBroom, so that tube in your hands, it looks like mine. Oh yeah, pretty cool ain't it? Did you know that tube is a rare delicacy? It's so great! Joe Croaker, you sure you like it? Oh yeah, I just finished one of those this morning. It was the most delicious thing ever. It is soft and smooth and juicy. Tremendously sweet. Nothing can beat that taste. Hey, you're telling me the truth, eh? Of course, yes, I am being so serious. Well you've got great taste, Joe Croaker, because most people might find this type of food a wee bit disgusting. Yeah? Just ignore them. As long as we're loving them, yeah. Aye, you're right, so let's share this one. Oh yeah, Broom, you're gonna be my new best friend! It's so great to have a friend who can share my appetite for foods that may seem a wee bit strange to others. Oh? My nectar tube, where could it be? I left it right here. Joe Croaker, I cannot believe I was wrong about you. We should share it. Okay. Hey, McBroom, I'm pretty sure I just heard you say we could share it. Aye, I did say that. But I think maybe we could eat this big one first. Huh? They taste almost exactly the same. Hey, you said you would share, huh McBroom? I want that tube that you got in your hands right there! But it's mine! I don't care. No way, I can't! Then we'll do this the hard way. (MCBROOM SCREAMS) McBroom! Somebody help me! Help, somebody! Whoa! Gotcha, pipsqueak! Oh, right. (GROANING) Good to see you again, old pal. No way! Hey you! Look there! Oh! All mine. It doesn't belong to you! Give it back! You're a big meanie! JOE: Whatever. Joe Croaker! What's going on? Bartle Bee, Joe Croaker stole a tube of me dung. Look! (CHUCKLES) Isn't that my nectar tube? No, it's mine. Oh really? That's a bit weird. Where's mine then? I put it among the flower petals. (WHISTLES) But McBroom, it's gone now. I best get out of here. BARTLE: Have you seen it, it's filled with nectar. That's right! Joe Croaker said he ate one that tasted sweet. That must've been your one. Huh? Joe? Where'd that big thief go? Joe Croaker! (CHUCKLES) Quit laughing! You give it back right now! No, my sweet dung tube! It took me hours to fill that tube and you just ate it? I can't believe it. Say what? Are you telling Joe Croaker just ate a dung tube? (COUGHING AND GAGGING) Gross! (BIRDS CHIRPING) (YAWNS) So tired. Cosmo. Oh hey! Yo Cosmo! Flutterbye is really sick and I'm taking her some of her favorite food. Favorite food? Yeah, well I gotta get going, see ya. Hang on Cosmo, I'm coming with you! Coming! I'm coming, I'm coming! So Flutterbye, you feel any better? Here, I brought you some of my special reserved chocolates! Come on, try some, they're good for your health. Thank you. You're amazing for doing this. (SOBBING) COSMO: Don't cry Flutterbye, it's okay. Wow, there's tons of food! Yummy for me. I guess there's one advantage to being sick. Being sick? I've got an idea! (CHUCKLES) Time for some dumpster scavenging. (JOE COUGHING) Hmm? Joe seems ill. What's wrong? Hey Joe! (SNEEZING) Are you all right? Hold on, you're sick too? I am. Really? I can't imagine you getting sick. Okay, just lie down. I'll go find you something to eat. Oh thank you, Cosmo. (CHUCKLES) (JOE COUGHING) Oh? Oh Joe Croaker, you don't seem well. Is it a bad cold? I've brought you some of my best pollen. You're going to love it! You're so sweet Flutterbye, thank you. Oh dear, you better get some rest and I'll come see you again tomorrow. The sick one gets the worm. Hey Joe! I told everyone in the marsh that you're sick, they're coming to see you, okay? (LAUGHING) Oh yeah, look at all this wonderful food! Just for Joe Croaker, all for me! (LAUGHING) It's no fun without Joe around. That's it, I've gotta find a way to cure that sick frog. (HUMMING) Hey there, Knitty. Joe Croaker's sick. Can you help him out? Joe is sick? I think I can. I got something right here. What is that thing? It's an herbal medicine. Now you run along and give it to him right away. Thank you, Knitty! I'll see you around! (MUNCHING) This is delicious. Hey Joe! I got some medicine for you from Knitty. She says it'll make you feel better. Soon you'll be on the road to recovery. That's just bitter! I can see you're much better. Maybe you don't need any. (COUGHING) I feel awful. Well maybe I'm wrong, so just in case you should take your medicine. I don't think these herbs are working too well. (JOE COUGHING) I need another cure. For the sake of all of this food, I must remain sickly. I don't like medicine. What to do. McBroom knows stuff about stuff. McBroom, McBroom! It's Joe, he's really really really sick, and the medicine I gave him isn't working, so maybe you have an idea. You should've told me this earlier. Sure I've got a better idea. Let's stick a dung ball in his mouth. Really? (SNORING) Hey Joe! Joe wake up, come on and sniff this! Sniff it good, Joe! It'll bring you back to health! (SCREAMING) What are you doing with that dung ball? McBroom told me this is a legendary dung ball that has great healing powers. Come on, sniff away. Cosmo, that's something I just won't do! Oh Joe, just ignore the smell, do you really wanna get better? Come on Joe, just sniff it! Get it away from me! Joe, it's for your own good, hurry up! Joe, quick, what's that over there? Sniff it! Achoo! (GROANING) You! But don't you feel better? (GROANING) Cosmo, I'm all dizzy. Maybe the dung ball ain't magic. (CHUCKLES) (SNORING) Hurry up Mantis, Joe's inside. (SCREAMING) Joe! Mantis here's gonna perform surgery on you. Say what? Oh yes, surgery. Surgery? Yup. Yeah, I'm the best saw-bones in town. Trust him Joe, his arms are sharp. No! Come on, trust me. No no no no! One slice and you'll be nice. All right. Don't worry Joe, I'll be here with you through the whole operation. (WHIMPERING) Right about here. Don't panic, just relax. No, no, don't do it, Mantis! I'm not sick! I'm not sick! I'm not sick! Leave me alone! (SCREAMING AND SOBBING) (ROCK MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull (LAUGHING) (COUGHING) (LAUGHING) (SCREAMING)
