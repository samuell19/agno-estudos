The story you are about to see is true. As far as I know. Okay. I'm sorry the people just turn and look at you as if you are from the zoo. Don't worry. I am from the zoo. Somehow I don't feel it's going to be safe for you. Look, don't get out of the car until I tell you to, okay? - You're getting out? - Yeah. It's okay, I'll be fine. It's so joyful. Just had the first victory. And there are lots of other people too, and you'll see them there. Jennifer, sweetheart, it's me again. Would you call me back, please? You're not gonna believe what I found. This story that you wrote in English class. I'm worried about you. Jennifer, I really need to talk to you. I don't know where you are. I mean, you could be anywhere. I'm going to send this to you. I'm going to send it express mail, and I want you to read it. Call me, please. Hey, babe. I guess you're already on the plane. Have a good trip back. I'll see you when you get home. Love you. I think that's why my partner's special, because he's probably the only man I've really and consistently loved for 10 years. Do you want to have children? Yeah. Oh, I get the motherly urge. I want children. Then I think, no, on Monday, I have a meeting, on Tuesday, I have a demonstration, on Thursday, my bank meeting, on Friday... Babe. I come bearing gifts. You got me something? Yeah. Where are you? Nowhere. I'm just... Sorry, I was just thinking about my mom. She's been calling, and, um... she, uh, read this story I wrote when I was a kid about my first boyfriend. And... I hadn't told her about it, because he was older. So she's beside herself, trying to reach me. Babe. You know, I never shot in Atlanta before. You got everything? Yeah. I'm kinda excited. It's gonna go great. Yeah. So that came for you. Oh, yeah? - It's from your mom. - Yeah. I'm gonna miss you. - Love you. - Love you. - I'll be back Tuesday. - Okay. Mom! Mother! You're getting it all over me. I just need you to eat a little. Can you get the milk for the-- I need milk for Lucy's. Sit down! Now! Excuse me. Come here. Go and sit! Go! Sit! And does it abut on protected land? Yes. Well, I'm going to need to have it assessed. I can have my guy out there by the end of the week. Yes, of course. I'd like to begin this story by telling you something so beautiful. Yeah, hey. I've been so worried about you. - Did you read it yet? - No. Where'd you find it? It was in a box in the storage room. What does it matter where I found it? What matters is what it says. What happened? What-- what are you talking about? You lied to me all these years. Mom, this is why I didn't tell you, because I knew you'd react this way. Oh, what is that supposed to mean? That I'm too stupid to understand? No, I never said that. I found Bill on the Internet. What? There he is, for all the world to see. Famous as ever. Hold on, I'm gonna go in the office. Just a minute. Mom, what are you talking about? Did you ever try looking him up? No, I thought he was, I don't know, dead or... Well, all you have to do is type in his name. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He looks so much older. I couldn't find anything on her, though. However, I do know somebody who'd put me in touch with Becky Davis. Yeah, Becky was there that summer. Yeah, and she lives right over on Fairview. What are you talking about? You know, you haven't come down for, like, two months. I could use a little help. - Mom, what are you doing? - Well, maybe she knows how we could get in touch with Mrs. G. I can't do this this weekend, okay? I've got papers to grade, and Martin wants me to look at venues on Saturday. You're 48 years old. You've been engaged for three years. He's not going anywhere. I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? Okay. Love you. Love you. Bye. I'd like to begin this story by telling you something so beautiful. I've met two very special people whom I've come to love dearly. Imagine a woman who's married and a man who is divorced sharing their lives in close friendship. Loving each other with all their souls... yet not being close with their bodies. Get this-- I'm part of them both. I'm lucky enough to be able to share in their love. When I'm away from them, the earth seems to shake and tremble... ...and often I'm afraid I'll fall off of it. Well, that was fast. Did you come to your senses? Mom, you are so wrong. What am I wrong about now? Mrs. G was an incredible woman. Did you read what your teacher said on the back page? Read it. Now. "If what you talk about here were accurate, "I would say you had been taken advantage of by older people. "But clearly you have a fine, full set of emotions blossoming into womanhood." You see? Even your English teacher knew without telling me. Can you just let me sit with my own memories? No, I want you to nail them. Mom, please. It makes me want to see her again. Who are you? Jennifer. - Who? - Jenny. The girl over there arriving at your house. Oh. Jenny. You're coming to spend the summer here. So you remember me? Of course I remember you. You've had a few lessons. Am I talented? Am I a good rider? No, I wouldn't say so. Not a natural. Your family's rich, though. - Jews. - Jews? I'd never met a Jew until I came to America. Jews don't ride horses. Ever seen a Jew competing at Brighton? I suppose I should get on with it. Hi, there. - You must be Jane. - I am. I'm Aaron, it's nice to meet you. - So nice to meet you finally. - Finally face-to-face. - Many phone calls later. - It's a pleasure. - Jenny, how are you? - Good, how are you? I'm well, I'm well. Let's take him to the stalls. Okay. Hey, Mom, what did you say Becky's address was? Can you text it to me? Why are you telling this story, Jenny? I always wanted to have a story to tell, but nothing ever happened to me before. - This is a beautiful piece of property. - Oh, thank you. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever met. Oh, it's so nice to have her... I knew my father would fall for her. Everyone did. I did. And there are two other girls who are joining Jenny this afternoon. - I see. - Which is lovely. Good number, I think. Not too many to keep an eyeball on. When Jenny first started with this horse business I didn't understand it. - Really? - Her mother still doesn't. I see now how good it is for her, though. Do you know, in Russia, Jews were not allowed to ride horses? - Dad! - What? Because no Jew could be higher than a Russian. But Jenny's great-great-uncle, he was very tall. - And he rode a horse. - Dad, please. - What? - You ready to work hard for the next few weeks, missus? Yes. Right, off we go. Take the salad, Franny. You take the rest. Thank you, Becky. And you, Mrs. Cat. It's hot. Use your gloves, please. Never, ever, ever put a pie crust on the bottom. It only gets soggy. That and the raisins are the secret to the perfect apple pie. But don't you tell anyone. Off you go. Dr. G and I are so pleased to welcome you to our home for what we're sure will be a fine summer season. Franny, would you lead us in grace, please? - Yes, ma'am. - Mom, can I say it? Raymond! Of course you can. Bless us... - Lord. - ...Lord, And these gifts that we're about to eat. And thank you for the friends and family that are gathered here with us, and keep us safe... How do people change? When I was a child, I was obsessed with changing myself. Now I don't even remember how I got here. Or who I used to be. Wow, look at you. You know, it's funny. I don't remember anything of what I learned, riding-wise, from Mrs. G. But I remember learning discipline. Yeah, me too. Her idea that you enduring pain makes you better. You know I, um, I kept my horse there after that summer. Oh, you were lucky. You got more time with her. Yeah. My parents, they never would have let me stay. I was an only child, so they watched me like a hawk. Well, I was one of five, so they barely noticed if I wasn't there. You know, I found some photos from that summer. - Oh, great. - Thought you might like to see them. Do you ever see Mrs. G at riding events or...? Oh, I saw Franny a few years back. I-- - You did? - Yeah. She said something about Mrs. G. Oh, look how beautiful. There's some great ones of Franny, too. But I couldn't seem to find any of you. You were such a tiny little thing, so much smaller than Franny and I. - Was I? - You almost looked like a little boy. - What? - So afraid that you barely said two words. Huh. I didn't know you were here. "Hello, Mother." "Hello, Jennifer." Looking for pictures from '73. Not in that book. Here. Oh. Yeah. Look at me. No, no, no, that's later. That's '75. You were already 15 here in this picture. Let me show you 13. There. That's 13. I was so little. Yeah. Why are you telling this story, Jenny? I always wanted to have a story to tell, but nothing ever happened to me before. Ah-- It's hot. Be careful. Don't tell anyone. It's our secret. - Mom, can I say it? - Raymond! Bless us, Lord, and these gifts that we're about to eat. Thank you for friends... I'd like to begin this story by telling you something so beautiful. Wakey-wakey! Time to run. Meet outside in 10 minutes. No stragglers. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever met. Every girl wanted to be just like her. Becky and Franny did. I did. Mrs. G. Good morning. We'll be running every morning before our first ride, with Bill. You're very lucky. Bill is an excellent coach. He will teach you to go beyond the complaints of your bodies. Running gives us stamina. Makes us into excellent riders. Good morning. Good morning, girls. - This is Franny... - Hi. Bill. - Becky... - Hi. And Jenny. I'm so happy to meet you. Jane has already told me a lot about you. So, here we go. Jane, why don't you run scout, I'll run gunner. We'll see how everyone does, and then we'll switch it up in the middle. - Come along, girls! - All right. I am Nouga and you are Neets! When I say Nouga, you say Neets! - Nouga! - Neets! - Nouga! - Neets! - Nouga! Nouga! - Neets! Neets! - Nouga! - Neets! Okay, Franny, you're doing great. - Just walk for a few minutes. - Okay. Jane? Good girl, Jenny. I'll walk with them. Meet you at the top. - Nouga! - Neets! - Nouga! Nouga! - Neets! Neets! - Nouga! - Neets! - Nouga! Nouga! - Neets! Neets! Martin? Franny? Funny how you live with people in your mind. Inside of you, they're always the same. And you live with them happily. Never wanting anything to change. As documentarians, you all have been developing your own unique skills, unconsciously, since you were born. I'll speak from my experience. I was a super-shy kid. I felt invisible. At home, at school. So I learned to adapt. I taught myself the skill of being a chameleon so that I could fit into people's worlds, their environment... and have some friends. Let's try something. Joe, how would you like to be a guinea pig today? Sure. Everybody say hi to Joe. Hey, Joe. So, we learn about the truth by reading people, right? It's how we get to know them. So, what about Joe? His body language-- it's defensive. Well, you're-- Let's change it up, Joe. All right, so there's a point. We learn a lot from people's bodies. They tell us a lot. So let's keep investigating. What else? Are you depressed, Joe? No. Do we believe Joe? Do you believe yourself? A little bit. So, good point. So that means he didn't tell you the truth. Right? So how do we get to know? How do we go beyond what the person is telling us? - Yeah? - How do we know when we've crossed the boundary? Excuse me. One second, guys. Sorry. Keep talking to Joe. Hey, Franny? Jenny Fox, is that you? Hi! How good to hear from you. So surprised to get your message. Yeah! What happened to your outside leg? - Hello? - Yeah. You know, the other left one? Are you talking to me? Sorry, I'm in the middle of work. - Where are you? - Oh, you don't know? I manage Mrs. G's farm. Have for years. Oh, wow, I didn't-- No, I didn't know. - Oh. - It would just-- it would be so amazing to come visit and maybe see you and Mrs. G. Do you still ride? Jenny? Um, not as much as I used to. They invited me to lunch. Are you wearing a wire? - What? No. - Oh, you should have a wire. I thought Martin was gonna to help you, no? You have to record everything. Mom, no. Martin's not gonna help me, and I'd be way too nervous to wear a wire. Just tell me you're gonna ask about Bill. I don't know. I'm gonna play it by ear. Okay, but don't forget-- tempus fugit. What does that even mean? You took Latin, look it up. No, Ma, that was one of your other kids. Oh, who could keep track? Okay, bye. Right, girls. Here we go now. - Now you missed a spot. - Sorry, Mrs. G. You can do better than that. See here. - Finish. - Mm-hm. Good girl. What's going on here? Sorry, Mrs. G. No excuses. Come on. Mrs. G, Franny. So good to see you. That coat. I feel like I remember from years past. It's ancient. Ah, here are our drinks. What are we having, Fran? Uh, yeah. Okay, Mary, Mother will have the onion soup... You know, I have a lot of regrets. You do? I would change so many things if I could go back in time. What would you change? Jenny, you gonna eat? Uh... sorry, yeah, I'll just have a mixed green salad. Thanks. Let's slow down, eh? I don't think I know where you're from, or maybe I never knew. - But you're from London? - No, West Country. I grew up on a farm. But my mum preferred the dogs over me. I was taken away and put in a children's home quite young. Right out of Dickens. I've been wanting to ask you... Better just get it over with. No need to wallow. Ray passed away two years ago. Oh, I'm so sorry. Dr. G has cancer. He's lived with it for a long time. No one thought he would live this long. So there. You know everything. Now we can change the subject. It's funny, I didn't even think about asking about Dr. G. I feel bad. I just-- I assumed they were divorced. Why would you say that? She and Dr. G are absolutely devoted to one another. Right. But what about Bill? What happened to him? I don't know what happened to him. I don't have any idea. Why am I doing this? Don't question yourself now. You're doing everything right. I said I wanted a riding lesson. Oh, that's smart. Build a rapport. Connect at her level. I don't know, what if she finds out I'm lying? I mean, I haven't ridden since I was a kid. It's just like riding a bike, honey. You'll be fine. Don't worry about it. She's an old woman. She's broken, you know? She's different than you, and she's had a hard life. We've all had a hard life. She looks nothing like I remember, you know? Like, she looked like such a giant to me then. You must push yourselves beyond all boundaries. No limits! My mom said Ray isn't even Dr. G's kid. She's divorced. You don't know what you're talking about. Her first husband killed himself. The day before the final competition, Mrs. G gave us a break from training. Five... Jenny, come join us. Yeah, come on in, Jenny. Nouga, over here! Nouga promised to come watch me ride. Why did we call him Nouga? What does that mean? Nothing. I don't know. I never asked him. Don't you think it's a little cult-like? No? What? I mean, I didn't think it at the time. But now, in retrospect... you know, the whole group thing. Worshipping pain. Endurance. It's a bit religious, don't you think? Really? Really, Jenny? I expected so much more of you. - Hey, Jenny. - Oh! - Hey. - Find it okay? Franny, whoa. She's out back. Okay. Yes, you're a beauty. Come on. Hello, Mrs. G. Let's get you up in the saddle and see what you can do. Hope you don't end up in the dirt like last time we saw you. Whoa, hold up. Hold up there. I don't know. He is huge. This one's a shark. Oh, what a shark. But how the shark can move. It's been a while. Oh, nonsense. You ready? Okay. There we go. Mr. Shark's got perfect conformation, but he was too small for breeding, so they cut him and put him up for sale. He's a giant. Let's see if I can do this. Okay... He needs contact with your hands to feel you. I haven't ridden in a while, so maybe a calmer horse? Nonsense. Now, remember the position. Heels down, head up like a queen. Arms down, Jenny. You know, quiet hands, quiet horse. Hands down, Jenny. Quiet hands, quiet horse. You know this. Yes, Mrs. G. I'd love to be in that daydream. It looks lovely in there. - Is it nice? - Yes! Yes. Okay, well that horse needs you to be present. - Let's go. - Okay, Mrs. G. Okay, Mrs. G. He can't feel you, Jenny, he can't know what you're asking for. You are a beauty. You look beautiful. You are a beauty. Good girl. Better. Canter now. No excuses. Canter now. Canter now. The body remembers everything. It really does. Good girl, Jenny! Let's go! Take that jump again. Come on. I-- I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. No fretting. No, it's fine. Get right back on that horse. Here we go. Good girl. Up. There we go. Take a breath. Okay. Want you to use this. We don't want that horse getting any bad habits, do we? No bad horses, only bad riders. There are no bad horses, only bad riders. Right? - Yes, Mrs. G. - Okay, let's take it again. Back on the rein-in, girls. Let's canter, please. Want you to take that jump again. Thank you so much for joining us today for our final demonstration of the girls' summer intensive. Today, they will be mock competing in three very demanding events. So let's wish them all good luck. Jenny. Jenny, your mother just called me. Your sister's broken her arm. Okay. I'm fine. They won't be able to pick you up till tomorrow. Go, Jenny! Bill and I want to take you out for dinner. Now? Yeah. - Are you serious? - Yeah, you hungry? - Yeah! - Come on. I'm starving. The guy from Geralyn Hall left a message saying they're booked all of July. But I think you should call him. You know, you talk people into anything. Oh, yeah? Do I talk you into everything? Look at what I'm doing. Cooking. Chili powder, maybe? - For a little... - Yes. Yes, that would be great. - ...pinch. - I'll work the chili powder. So how was-- how was the hall you went to see this weekend? It's supposed to be a good one. I'm excited about it. ♪ If I could read your mind, love ♪ ♪ What a tale your thoughts could tell ♪ ♪ Just like a paperback novel ♪ ♪ The kind that drugstores sell ♪ ♪ When you reach the part ♪ ♪ Where the heartaches come ♪ ♪ The hero would be me ♪ There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I have been very impressed with your running this summer, Jenny. Really. But I want you to consider joining my inner-city running team when you come back from vacation. You serious? I am serious. You have talent. And, more importantly, you have guts. Without guts, talent is wasted. Yeah. Strong body, strong mind. - Yeah. - Say it. - Strong body, strong mind. - There you go. It's just-- it's just so hard to leave. You'll be all right. You'll be fine. Jane tells me that you're quite a storyteller. Do you know I write, too? - Really? - Mm-hmm. Poetry. Can I write you when I'm on vacation? - I'd love that. - We would love that. You can write us and you can tell us anything you want. Anything. There are no secrets at this table. And we don't want to keep any secrets from you, either. Jane and I have talked, and we've decided that we want us all to be equals. And we respect you too much to lie. So we want you to know that Jane and I are lovers. How do you feel? Well, I'm happy for you. I'm happy you have each other. I don't want you to be miserable like my parents. - You see? - Dear girl. Told you she has a deep soul. How did they know they could trust me with their secret? That I would never break their confidence? The other girls would have told on them. I would never tell my parents, or the other adults. It was like an unspoken oath. And I felt proud of it. What are you doing now? Hey. They sent me a bunch of letters. Where's the rest of the stuff from my room? Letters are in this box. Mom, how long did you know these were here? How come you didn't give me these before? I found them when I found your story. And I didn't give them to you because... Because I was ashamed. "My Dear Jenny, "I was so sad reading your special letters..." I hate being home. Even in this beautiful place, my brothers and sisters never stop fighting. My mom and grandmother yell at them constantly. "It's easier to be unhappy in this world. "It has been burned into my brain "that it is I that is selfish. I take, they give." "My dear Jenny, "Nouga and I shared our cards from you, "your poems of pathos. I hope you don't mind. "You have some very special kind of beauty, Jenny, and it's natural to want to share..." I'm so confused. But at the same time, I feel free. It's getting to where one can't walk in broad daylight. And that one goes running around at all hours. A woman was raped last year over on Spencer. What are you going on about? Jenny, can you go get your brother? It's time for dinner. We talked about this. I will not have your mother instilling fear in my children. Can you just keep your voice down? She gave up her summer to help me. This is still my house. I-I know... Jenny, I feel for you. Growth always means change. But then Nouga says change is almost always painful, and thus pain is joy. So we smile again. Dear Jenny, try to continue with your running. Before long, the pleasure of doing it will appear again. Each day, the well-done piece will build your confidence. Is your horse a boy or a girl? It's a boy. - It's a beautiful horse. - Thanks. So glad you've made a new friend, my dear Jenny. This wonderful experience will only open new worlds for you to come. But do not rush. You have plenty of time to enjoy everything. Mom? Dad? Are you in there? Would you keep it down, please? Your father and I are trying to take a nap. Sorry, Mom, but it's very important. My friend, well, he invited me to the fair. We'll be back by 9:00. Wait, who invited you? A new friend from the stable. Lucas Mendelssohn. - His family's from Texas. - Of course not, Jenny. We don't know his family, and you know the rule. You know we have dinner reservations with the Wheelers. Now go get dressed. He's flying home with his family tomorrow. Please? We'll be back right at 9:00. I don't want to repeat myself. And you heard your father. This is an important dinner. Your dad's gonna close the financing on the new development, so go get dressed. They said I can't go. Well, maybe my mom can call your mom. But it won't matter. It's just one of their stupid rules. I hate them. Young lady. What did we just discuss? Babes. Babe? Come on, let's go. We're all waiting in the car. I don't want to go. Honey, what was the name of your friend? That boy, his family? What was his name? - Mendelssohn. - Mendelssohn. That's right. I knew I knew the name. I played golf with his father two weeks ago. Joel Stern brought him to the club. Anyway, come on. Move it. Let's go. I have made a decision. I'm taking my life into my own hands. That fall, every Friday, my dad picked me up from school and dropped me off at Mrs. G's. Hi, my love. Let me look at you. Someone's kept up with her training. I have made a decision. I'm taking my life in my own hands. That fall, every Friday, Mrs. G picked me up from school and took me to her farm. It was pure bliss. It was heaven. I was finally home. I was finally home. We tell ourselves stories in order to live. So, what's your story? What story are you gonna tell? Thank you. I think we should tell your parents about visiting Bill at his house. What do you think? I don't think they'd understand. Ha! They don't understand anything. It's like if I was invisible. Like if I didn't even exist. Well, your parents are just afraid of the world. They're just afraid of living, of being free. They cannot accept that you are becoming a woman. They can't see you the way that we can. They're such hypocrites. I hate them. You shouldn't hate them, Jenny. You should pity them. They're just not brave like you are. You're not afraid of life. Right Jenny? You're not afraid of living. How about this? We will form our own family based on complete honesty and love. Hiding nothing, revealing everything. Just the truth. And we'll never lie to each other. Never. Like the rest of the world does. That's exactly right. I have to go. We have to go. Come on, missus. I haven't even made dinner. When it came time to leave, we had to hurry. You know how he gets when he hasn't got his dinner. Dr. G always got mad if we came home late. It's always you two going off. Jane, why doesn't Jenny have dinner with me tonight? And that way we get a little bit more time to talk about all this stuff? Then if it gets too late, you can sleep in my son's old room and I'll bring her over first thing tomorrow morning. How does that sound? It's not up to me. Jenny can make her own mind up. Can't you? Good. Then it's decided. What did I say? I have to go either way. I don't remember. I must have said something. I only remember them. Why can't I remember myself? Did I say yes? Why would you do that? Well... ...it's my life. I can make my own decisions. Really? You think so? Yeah. So, what did you say? Well, I said yes, because I want to prove to Bill and Mrs. G that I'm mature. But that's not what you wrote. You wrote that you don't want to be here. That you want to go back with Mrs. G to her house. Look in your notebook. It's right there. That's just a fiction story. What do you mean fiction? We wrote this as-- It's a version of what happened. What does that mean? A lot of it's true. My teacher says that all stories are based on the writer's life. You don't know what's about to happen. I know Mrs. G much better than Bill, but Bill is not gonna hurt me. - What if you're wrong? - Stop! You've become just like all of them. You just want to tell me what to do. It's my life. Mine. Not yours. Let me live! What if you're wrong? I never saw a gold medal before. - Pretty cool, huh? - Yeah. Watch out! I picked out a book of poetry that I wanted to show you. It's Rumi. I have wanted to show you this since the first time I read your writing, because it reminded me of you. Really? You'll see. Okay... here we go. Start there, and just read it out loud. But I'm not a very good reader. Oh, I am sure you read beautifully. Okay. "Make yourself free from self at one stroke. "Like a sword without a trace of soft iron. "Like a steel mirror, scours off all rust with contrition." All rust with contrition. "That you may see your own pure, bright essence." Nouga, it's so beautiful. Yes. I just knew you would like it. I just knew it. Jenny, are you cold? Your hands are trembling. Um, they always shake. I meant to light the fire, but now it's too late. You shouldn't freeze. Are you feeling okay? Yeah. Maybe I should just call Mrs. G-- No, no, I'm okay. I-- I feel fine. I don't want to go home. Look. Okay, well, then why don't you read the other poem that's in there with the page turned down. Yes! That's my favorite. "Call of Love." And I'll be right back. I'm going to get you a blanket. Um, okay. "At every instant "and from every side resounds the call of love." I can't hear you! "We are going to heaven. "Who wants to come with us? "We have been the friends of the angels. "We will go back there, for there is our country." Okay, now move back. All right, you'll feel a lot warmer in a second. How's that? Is that better? Yeah. "We are higher than heaven." Okay, now scoot over. I'm cold now. Don't stop. You're doing great. "More noble than the angels. "Why not go beyond them? - Our goal--" - Jenny, you are so special. Did you know that? You're so deep. "Our goal is the supreme majesty. What has the fine pearl--" I want to save you from all of those... stupid young boys out there. I think you are... perfect. "Why-- Why have--" Jenny... would you do something for me? Would you let me see you? Will you just show me what you look like without...? Okay. Are you shy? Do you think I want you to have big breasts like Mrs. G? I don't. Do you want to take your shirt off? Yeah? O-- Okay. Okay. You've been preparing for this moment. I don't think we should tell Mrs. G about us. I don't think she's quite ready. Do you want to keep reading? Hey. Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing, reading my childhood things? Who are they from? Who wrote them? From the relationship I told you about. They're from an adult man. Yeah. I told you he was older. Just please don't go through my things. I mean, how old was he? He's 40, I don't know. That's rape. That's illegal. Babe... How old were you? Like 13, 14? It was the '70s, and people didn't talk about it like that. But babe the '70s, '80s, it doesn't matter. I don't want you to justify this. I'm not trying to justify it, okay? It was my childhood, and these things happened to me and it's just, you know, I'm just saying, it was complicated. You talked about the relationship, but this is a grown man. He was my coach. But what does that have to do with it? He was 40 years old. He was my age. Taking advantage of a child. Babe... this was important to me. And I'm trying to figure out why, okay? These people were important to me. People? Who are these people? I saw a letter from a woman. Who was that? That was my riding teacher. She introduced him to me, you know? And she was there that summer. - That's why I went to see her. - But, you-- I am trying to figure it out. Why do you want to find them when you're the victim? I'm not saying that to-- Okay, I am not a victim. I don't need you or anybody, to call me a victim, okay? Because you don't have a fucking clue about my life. So we need to stop this now. Let me just figure this out for myself. Jennifer, I don't know your life? After six years? Have you ever thought about seeing a therapist? If you knew me, you'd know I ain't going to see a therapist. I'm gonna figure this out myself. Did you ever even look at the ring I brought you? Do you think I give a shit about a ring? That's you again, not knowing me. Your car is here. I'm not going to leave with us like this. I'm not going to. Look, Jennifer, let's-- let's talk. - I want to be here for you-- - Please! Please! Please go. I'm not leaving like this. Good! Then I'll leave. - So you stay. - So-- No, no, no. - You stay. No, you stay. - All right, look, - you don't have to leave. - And I'll get my shit together. I want you the fuck out of here! Go, or I go. Go, or I go. And when I come back, we're going to have to talk about this. Why did you pick me? I'm a skinny, flat-chested, introverted kid. You can't see yourself. I keep working on your self-image, but you're so stubborn, so attached to your drama. Becky was so much prettier. Becky was closed off already. You're an adult now, Jenny. You tell me. How do you find freshness in the world of adults? Look at yourself. Look at me. Doubtful, jaded. Unable to be surprised. I'm dying in my own skin. I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. That earnestness, the devotion, the love. An adult cannot love like that. Only children can. It's so pure. You still believe in possibilities. As I do. As I do. See? Two peas in a pod? Yes, exactly. I hoped you would save me from my family. Didn't I? God, I feel crazy. Maybe I'll get into a crash and the... car'll catch on fire. The whole thing'll go up in flames. All my secrets. History erased in a flash. Just like that. - Hello. - Hi. You must be Mrs. Fox. Yes. How lovely to finally meet you. These are for you. Oh, thank you. And, uh, for your-- for your husband. - Oh. Um-- - I'm a big fan. Been following his progress in the local papers. Jane wanted me to tell you that she is so sorry that she couldn't pick Jenny up tonight. Um, but she asked me to. This house is right on my way home from work. I live across the field from Mrs. Gramercy? She's... - You coach Jenny's running? - Yes. - Please, Mom. - Yes I do. She's a very talented runner. She shows a lot of promise. You should be very proud. - I am proud. - Okay... - Let's go. - A wonderful, wonderful girl. All right, please tell Mrs. Gramercy I'd like Jenny home Sunday by 5:00 p.m. sharp, so she can get her homework done. Absolutely. One of us will have her back in time Sunday night. - Okay, let's go. - Don't have to worry. All right. Uh, bye. I find that I trust him so much, I never realize where he's leading me. Just breathe. Once we're that far, I don't know how to say no. It's okay. I love him. He loves me. Not yet. We have to keep stretching you open slowly. No young boy would ever do this for you. But I'm not giving up. I'm ready for you. Ohh. Oh! Hey. Good morning. Thanks, Mom. Oh, my God, I fell asleep. Well, that's a good look for you. Trashed. Oh, my God, I'm just locked in. I can't-- I can't turn it off right now. Do you think Bill and Mrs. G paid extra attention to me because Dad was like a big developer back then? No, that didn't have anything to do with it. It was because you were an unusual child, and you knew how to talk to adults. I was thinking about the first time that you met him. You know when he came here to pick me up? Oh, I'll never forget that day. You kidding? All my antenna went off. As soon as you were out of the house with him, I ran to your father. - Flowers. - Yeah. He gave me flowers. And look, he gave you a gift, too. Here. Why would anyone do that? Just like your mother. You think the world is full of danger. Our daughter spends every weekend in the home of a divorced woman on her second marriage. Nadine, what are you even talking about? What do we really know about her? And now this Bill? Mom, sorry. I just-- Can we go-- Ow!-- Can we go inside the house? - Oh, yeah, sure. - Yeah, sorry. I just-- - Here, I'll take your bag. - Okay, thanks. Didn't Bill bring Dad, like, a paperweight? Yeah. He did. Was it like Christmas or something? No, it wasn't Christmas. It was autumn. You and Dad were going somewhere 'cause Grandma was here babysitting. Was she? I don't remember. He wasn't taking me to Mrs. G's. I just wanted to say that I'm glad you guys are all here. I wanted to share my good fortune with the people that I love. My boys, and Jenny. So, cheers. - What was that man doing to you? - Nothing! What do you mean, nothing?! You wait until I tell your parents! Grandma knew, right? So you knew something. What are you talking about? No. Well, I mean she saw Bill and I, out front, kiss, and she said she was gonna tell you. My mother saw you? She didn't tell you something about seeing us kiss? - She said she was gonna tell. - No, absolutely not. I would've killed him. Of course, whenever I asked you about Bill, you did lie. Yeah, and you lied to yourself. Whoa, wait a minute. I asked you specifically if Bill and Mrs. G were having an affair, and you looked me right in the eye and you said no. Why are you so angry now? Well, why are you not angry? That's what I want to know. How would you-- How would you feel if it was your daughter? What would you do? Huh? Mom, you knew something. You told Dad, and he talked you out of it. That's true. You were following Dad's rules, just like Mrs. G followed Bill's rules. Are you equating me with Mrs. G and you father with that--? No, no. Mom, listen. I'm saying it's complicated. I'm saying she was deeply insecure, she was probably sexually abused herself as a kid. Probably. Trust me.... I know. It can damage your boundaries. At last, you admit you were damaged. Fine, Mom. There's a question I've been wanting to ask since I read your story. Yeah? Did you like it? Mom... I was a kid. Why are you asking me that? I just don't understand. Why did you keep going back? I got something else. What? Tell me. I want to know. Love. I... I wanted somebody to think I was special. Well... you were always special to me. Mom, Jesus. And then after that, you became so promiscuous. You slept with all kinds of men. Foreign men, married men... You didn't care about the wives. - Mom... - You didn't care about anything. You sound very old-fashioned. That's old-fashioned, huh? You were with one man your entire life. I didn't-- I didn't want to be stuck like that. I didn't want to be like you. Excuse me. Bill Allens has stood on the podium in 1960 and 1964. When he moved to teaching at the university, his vision extended far beyond the valley. - And lunges. - Bill became a coaching legend. And now butt kicks. He would cultivate his larger-than-life image at universities all across the country. Coach Allens picked me out of a crowd and believed in me. They called his relay team the island of the misfit toys. We were all kids who no one would have noticed, but he saw our talent and he just pushed us to excel. And we all want to win, but that's secondary. What's most important is that we feel that we've done this as a team. And we've learned to persevere and strive for excellence. And I hope that you think of this time fondly, and that it helped make you who you are. William P. Allens. Yeah, he coached at the university from '71 to '82. You said that he sexually abused you in '73. But, um-- we were-- we had a relationship. Okay, um, I'm very sorry. I'm-- I'm very sorry. I hope this helps. I was able to get his phone number from one of my investigators. Oh. Thank you. I assume you're in the process of building a case against him. No, I just, um, I just wanted to know what's happened to him, you know, since me and... why he left the university after '82. Hello, you've reached William Allens. Best in Sports. Leave a message and I'll return your call-- Well, you probably have your answer for that. I mean if he abused-- if you had a relationship, that usually means that there were others. - Others? - There's never only one. Detective Amato said something about others. Can he find them? I don't-- Mom, there weren't others. I would have known. Oh, for God's sakes. Honestly, sometimes I find it hard to believe you're my own child. Hello, you've reached William Allens. Best in Sports. Leave a message and I'll return your call at my earliest convenience. Hey, Bill, uh, this is J-- this is Jenny Fox. Many, many young athletes. How many others were there? Was I the youngest? Someone else must have known about me. There must have been a witness. Who are you? The secret to the perfect apple pie... Don't tell anyone, though. It's our secret. Jews were not allowed to ride horses, because no Jew could be higher than a Russian. - Really? - Yeah. I don't think we should tell Mrs. G about us. Use that crop, Jenny. I don't think she's quite ready. There's always blood the first time. You remember me, don't you, silly? Sure. That's Iris. She was the college student that ran Mrs. G's barn. She was so sweet. I don't remember. Was she around all the time? She was there the day that Mrs. G put you on her stallion, Puff. Such a cute kid. A lot of heart, that one. She's made huge improvements this summer-- leaps and bounds. Funny, now that we're talking about it, there's something else I remember. Isn't he gorgeous? She is. Have you lost weight, Becky? - I've noticed it too. - Mm. You're lookin' really good. I'm sure Bill didn't mean anything by it, - but I was so repressed-- - Keep up your training, you'll be able to compete with us in the fall. Love for you to join my inner-city running team. I couldn't handle him noticing me, you know, as a woman. Do you know how to get in touch with Iris? Oh, not a clue. I don't think I even knew her last name. But Mrs. G would know. She was so close with her. You've reached the Gramercy residence. Please leave a message for Dr. G or I after the beep tone. Hel-- Hello, Jane, it's Jennifer Fox. Sorry I missed you. I'm just-- it's funny, I'm near your house. I just thought it would be lovely to come by and say hello again. Shit. I'm ready to make a group beyond marriage. Marriage is terrible. Beyond all formal rules of commitment. Jenny, do you trust me? Yeah. Do you want to come with me? I want us to make a real group. You, me, Mrs. G, and Iris. Iris. ...visiting my mom and... - Of course not. - I'm so sorry. Oh, I brought you a bottle of wine. Oh! But when I was at my mom's, I found some treasures of you competing. Oh. I wanted to compete again this summer, but with Anthony sick, I can't plan anything. I wake up every morning and don't know if I'll be able to leave the house. I understand. That must be so hard. Oh, thank you. So, I found some pictures you might find amusing from the summer that I stayed here with you. Mm. Let's see. Do you recognize that lady? Oh, my! That is a good picture of me. I don't have any good photos of me at all. Remember these girls? Who is this? Me. I was trying to remember, uh... who was the older girl? Very pretty brunette who was there that summer? Iris Rose. - Yeah. - Can you imagine? Two flowers for a name. God, she was beautiful. - Yeah. - She was in college. She worked for me all that year. Yeah, I remember that. Do you know how to get a hold of Iris? What's this? Oh, I didn't mean to-- uh... it's Bill. I-I-I was looking on the Internet, and there was a-- a book on American running, and they-- they had a whole, um... Yeah, what-- what happened to Bill? I don't know. Uh-- Let me get my glasses. There were two chapters dedicated to him and all about his coaching. I guess they've named a wing after him at a university. Last I heard, his sister called me, trying to find Bill, because their... their mother... Let's get you that map. I'll give you directions to get out of here so-- Franny told me that you had trained for the World Games, so I was sure he trained you. No, he didn't. She was wrong. I wasn't in the World Games, although I have won several gold medals. I loved you and Bill so much. Here's the turnoff for the interstate. I just need to know what happened. You just follow this road out here. - It isn't hard. - You must've known. It's a little dark out right now. And then you'll find the turnoff and you'll be on the interstate in no time. I need to talk about it with someone who was there. Please. You can take the map if you'd like. You should go now. It's very late. I'm quite tired. Jane, is somebody here? - Ah, hello. - Oh. - It's-- It's Jenny Fox. - Jenny! Jenny Fox! - Yes. - Ho ho ho! Oh, good to see you. - Hello, Dr. G. - Jenny Fox. Jenny just said that she was leaving. Oh. Sorry, it's so late. I know. Oh, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, with all your questions. I feel like you want me to apologize for something. I'm not sure. What do you want? - No. - No? Okay. I just want to know you. You can't. I'm trying to understand. Do you know how lucky you were to have a teacher like Bill? He's so special. I never had anyone like him. You never win without perseverance. Just a little while longer, and then it will be over, and it will never hurt again. You'll see. Now you are a woman, my love. Professor Fox, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, so ordinarily I'd say you should take the time to build up trust with your subject, right? But, um... sometimes you gotta surprise 'em. Right? To get beyond their defenses. So, Samantha, why don't you... tell us all about your first sexual experience. Uh, yeah, okay. I was... I was 17. His name was Rick. Yeah, he was my age. So, your childhood sweetheart or whatever? Yeah. And did you enjoy it? Did I enjoy it? Um, yeah, I think. Right, the whole thing was actually just-- It was kind of sweet, because we'd been best friends since... God, sixth grade? You know, we had no idea what we were doing. We were just a couple of kids. Looking back on it, I... I was younger than I thought of myself to be, you know? And yet, I'll never forget in the moment, there was just so much tenderness. I think I even had a little... um... you know. You know what I'm saying. No. What? Uh... I mean, if you're not going to be able to talk about sex, I don't know how you're going to interview other people about all kinds of shit, so... Okay. Uh... I think I had a little... orgasm. I don't know, I wasn't expecting it. I didn't know what it was. It just-- It wasn't the same as it is now. You know, because in the beginning it's like... it's just like these little... sparks. And, I mean, it felt really... just really natural, I think. So it's a tough thing, because what happens is, especially at that age, is that it feels good. I mean, it feels good. Someone is touching you in an area that is sexual, and so you kind of enjoy it, and so-- - There's guilt. - There's a sense of like... well there's a sense of guilt, of feeling like you enjoyed this, and not understanding that it was-- it's not a good thing and it's not appropriate. One needn't be ashamed. I mean, you know... I mean, otherwise we wouldn't be able to live with ourselves. I have friends who just, like, go on about sex like it's the most amazing thing in the world, and I just-- I can't relate. Like, what? Why? You know? What's so fantastic about it? Because I also never orgasmed. You know? Can you when you're alone? Yeah. But never with someone. Right. Yeah, but I... I feel like that's normal for most women. I wasn't abused, but for me it took me years to get comfortable, to have an orgasm with a man. I don't think that it has anything to do with abuse. Hello, you've reached William Allens. Best in Sports. Leave a message, and I'll return your call at my earliest convenience. Hey, Bill. This is Jenny Fox calling again. I'm just-- I don't want to keep calling and calling, but I think we need to talk. So can you please call me back? - Hello? - Hey, Jennifer. It's Detective Amato. Oh. Hey. Listen, I thought you might be interested to know, there'll be a big event. William Allens is receiving an award. - Oh... - Also, I found that woman you were looking for. Iris Rose? She teaches middle school. Okay, okay. See how miserable people look in their little nuclear units? - Stop fighting. - Come on. It's all those rules. Monogamy. Marriage. It's killing people. Maybe it just depends on the people. Two tickets, please. You really need to start thinking more clearly, Jenny. Thank you. Jenny? Jenny? Oh! Hey, Iris! - How are you? - Good! Good to see you! - You too. - I'm so glad you called. Do you want to, um, grab a tea or something? Yeah, there's a little place right down here - that we can go. - Okay, okay. And you and Bill were, um... were lovers, right? Yes, um... Mrs. G arranged that I would work for him part-time and work for her the other time. And I would work in his garden. And I remember I was wearing a bikini, and he invited me in. Oh, it was the '70s. Yeah, I remember him... He said that... I think you guys had a threesome with Mrs. G, right? He told you that? Yeah. Yeah, we did. Yeah, we were lovers too. You and Bill? Mm-hmm. But how old were you? Thirteen. So... Wow. That--- That's the age of the kids that I teach now. Yeah, kids, right. Do you have any memory of, um... Mrs. G and Bill planning a foursome? Do you remember that? - With you? - Yeah. I think they were planning a weekend, like around here somewhere, to go to a hotel... I don't remember that at all. The four of us? Yeah, Bill and Mrs. G and you... bringing me into it. Oh, damn it. Wow. Boy, I haven't thought about that in a long-- long time. Yeah. How'd he rope her into that? Rope Mrs. G? No, it was more like she was the cat bringing the mouse to him. - Wow. - Yeah. How-- How-- So she was the one-- Oh, yeah, she was totally into it. I've met two very special people whom I've come to love dearly. Jenny, I've got a crazy idea. What if you kept your horse with me all fall, and then you could visit on the weekends? Mrs. G has a fantasy of you sucking on her breast. My beauties. Jenny, what we really want to do is explore our unconscious. Bring it into consciousness. Together. In our family. You'll have to tell your parents that you have a track meet in Delaware. And then Mrs. G will pick you up from school, and Iris and I will meet you at the hotel at 6:00. And then we'll have you back home Sunday night, like usual. Bill and I have already spoken to Iris about it, but we'd like you to bring something special. And don't forget your running shoes. Mom, did you get me the juice I wanted? Sue, you're getting it all over-- Oh, here. Here's your juice. Hey, Harold, Harold, no. It's my favorite kind. Darling, I'm sorry. Sit. Go. Sit. Go and sit! Nana, do you like my painting? I love it. Go and sit! Hey, Dad. Hey, babe. Hello? Jennifer. - Hey. - I've been calling you. You haven't answered any of my calls. I even tried you at the university. Hello? Martin, I gotta go meet him. What are you-- what are you talking about? I need to see him. Look, I don't-- Jennifer-- I need to talk to him. I need to try to... He's not gonna tell you anything. ...figure out who he is. Listen, promise me, Jennifer. Promise me that you won't do anything until I get there. - I just want to understand. - I'm on the next plane back. - Jennifer, look... - Babe, please. ...you cannot go there alone, okay? - Babe. - Jennifer, listen to-- Oh, honey, sweetie... I feel sick. Yeah, you got a little fever. I think it's the flu that's going around. Come on. We'll get you in bed. But I have a track meet this weekend. Well, you'll have to cancel. Please, Mom? No. Nothing's that important. I'll just call Mrs. G. We'll tell her you can't come. Okay? Let's get you in bed. All right? All right. I'll come check on you in a few minutes. Just a few hours later, my stomachache was completely gone. My body had told me what my mind refused to accept. I'm tired. So tired. Tired in ways that I'm afraid. The fear is a fear of a broken dream. I have made a decision. Go get your father. It's time for dinner. - Okay, Mom. - Harold? Wait, Harold... Hello? Hello? Bill? Jenny! I'm so happy you called. I was worried sick. Jenny? Are you-- are you there? Yes, I'm here. Did you go on... with Jane and Iris without me? No, no. None of us wanted to. We all agreed, we want to wait for you. So, don't worry. We will pick another weekend. I don't want to see you anymore. Wait. It-- Is it your parents? Because if it is, I can talk to them. They don't-- They don't understand you the way that-- that I do. And if you don't want to do a weekend, we don't have to. I don't want to see you anymore. But Jenny... Jenny... please. I love you. I need you. We can work everything out. Please just... please don't leave me. I'm gonna hang up now. Don't hang up, wait, wait-- Jenny? Jenny, dinner! Gramercy residence. Jane speaking. Hello. It's Jenny. I'm coming to pick up my horse this weekend. Fine. Stupid girl. Stupid, stupid girl. Where's your father? "We had a dream. "A beautiful dream. "We were going to fill the emptiness in each of our souls with love from the other." What happened with you and Bill? Why'd you leave him? Me leave him? You don't know? You were just the beginning, Jenny. There were so many others. I tried to keep up, but I'm old. I'm old. "But as so many dreams, reality does not hold true." I couldn't ask for help. I was waiting for you to save me. Somehow in my mind, it couldn't be anybody else. It had to be you. Why didn't you? No one saved me. "The pretty colors and ribbons "I had decorated Bill and Mrs. G with "disintegrated, "and they were left naked. "The overwhelming pain of weakness. "The sickening fact of someone "who once seemed so strong. Only to find that the strength is only in their words." Thank you, Jenny. That's quite a powerful story. Do you mind telling us where you got it from? Oh... I made it up. That's what I thought. You see, class, fiction allows us to live things far outside our own experiences... Oh. Mom, don't stop. Oh, that's one of my favorite memories. In the summers, after the ice cream truck, all the kids gathered around. Listened to you play. I don't have it in my fingers anymore. I failed. I didn't want it to be true. I told myself it couldn't be true. I failed at the one thing a mother is supposed to do. Protect her child. I am so sorry. You lied to me. You told me it was a good thing all these years. And it was. I got an A. An A? You think that matters? That doesn't make it good. You want me to be some pathetic victim. Well, you know what? I'm not. I've got something no one else does. I'm the teacher now. Not just some invisible kid. You'll never get married. I don't want to get married. Have you not been listening to me? You'll never have children. I hate children. I don't want to have children. I'm sure of that. But I know one thing. He loved me. He cried. He cried, didn't you see? And for years... he's gonna send me cards. Dear Jenny, how was your graduation? Please give my best to your folks. Dear Jenny, with all the trouble in Israel... ...I read about you in the newspaper today... ...I hope you return to your running. Dear Jenny, I am so proud of your growing career. Dear Jenny, you were always such a natural. You see? I'm not the victim of this story. I'm the hero. He fell apart, not me. You couldn't even think that their lives might continue without you. That there would be others. You froze them in time, didn't you? But you know, he's still alive, and I'm gonna go see him now. No. For his lifetime dedication to the youth of Alexandria, we would like to award William P. Allens this plaque of civic excellence. Thank you all. Thank you very much. - I'm actually deeply touched. - I'm here for you. And this could not have been done, obviously, without you, without your support, the youth of this region, they've learned to persevere. They've learned to strive to excellence as a measure of your focus, your concern, your support. Thank you. Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. I don't believe we've met. I'm Jennifer. Hmm. How do you know William? Uh, he was my running coach. Of course. My husband is just completely flattered that so many of his former students - have come out to honor him. - Husband? Yeah. Would... would you like to meet him? Uh, say hello, yeah. It's been a long time, so... Okay. How are you feeling? - Really well. - Ah, good, that's good. You're the best. You're the best one we have. - I'm not kidding. - Hi, Bill. Hey. Boy, your hair. Such curls. Looks beautiful. Has anybody ever seen such beautiful hair, huh? Miss...? Do you-- It's Jenny. - Jen... - Jenny Fox. Um... Jenny. Well, I never expected to see you here in a million years. Yeah, it's been difficult getting a hold of you. Jenny. Well, I have the pit bull Marge here. - Yeah, we met. - You got one of those? No, no, I never got married. You told me that was selling out, remember? You got me. You got me with that one. Yes, I remember that. So how long has it been exactly, what... Time just flies away, doesn't it? Yeah, in a blink. Blink. And one wrong blink and you're headed down the wrong path. Excuse me, but how do you guys know each other? Bill was my coach. Remember? Sure. We had a good time-- When I was 13, right? Yeah. Natural athlete. I used to love to watch you tuck your shoulder into a turn and-- Pretty good in bed too, right? Pardon me? You know what I said. You know what happened, and so do I. I don't know what you-- what do you mean? I wanted you to know I hated every minute of it. I don't have any idea what you're talking about. No? You don't remember me puking every time we had sex? And you would tell me maybe it was because I was pregnant. But that would be hard, because I hadn't even got my period yet. Remember that? Huh? A 13-year-old kid? - None of this is true. - What happened to you that you would do that to me? - None of this is true. - I thought we were lovers. You didn't call me your girlfriend? That's not true. That's not true. You couldn't fit your dick in me? - You don't remember that? - Ohh. Okay, Jenny, it was nice seeing you. Huh, Bill? Bill. What happened to you? Can someone please go get security? What happened to you, that you would do that to me? Nothing happened. What do you mean? It wasn't me. It wasn't me, it was you! You didn't believe. You didn't trust. Oh, I did believe. That was the problem. - I believed you. - You deceived yourself. Sweet girl, Jenny. - "We are higher than heaven." - It was you. It was you. You never believed. You never believed. - Come on. - You never trusted me. I believed your story. Huh, Bill? You were the grownup! What? Nobody else was coached by Bill? I'd like to begin this story by telling you something so beautiful. I've met two very special people whom I've come to love dearly. Imagine a woman who's married and a man who's divorced. Get this. I'm part of them both.
