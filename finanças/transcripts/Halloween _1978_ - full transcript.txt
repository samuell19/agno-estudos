Covens of witches with all of their hosts. You may think they scare me, you're probably right. Black cats and goblins on Halloween night. Trick or treat! ( Owl hooting ) Girl: My parents won't be home until 10:00. Boy: Are you sure? We are alone, aren't we? Michael's around someplace. ( Qiggles ) Take off that thing. - Let's go upstairs. - Okay. ( Qiggles ) ( clock ticking ) Boy: Look, Judith, it's really late. I got to go. Judith: Call me tomorrow? Yeah, sure. - Promise? - Yeah. (clock chiming ) (Judith humming) Michael! - ( Screaming ) - ( Stabbing ) Michael! ( Breathing heavily ) Michael? ( Thunder crashing ) ( rain pattering ) ( thunder crashes ) You ever done anything like this before? Only minimum security. I see. Man: Their driveway's 200 yards up on the right. ( Thunder crashes ) Nurse: The only thing that ever bothers me is their gibberish. When they start raving on and on. You haven't anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years. Nurse: Are there any special instructions? Man: Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it. Don't you think we could refer to it as him? If you say so. Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor. What do I give him when we take him in front of the judge? Thorazine. He'll barely be able to sit up. That's the idea. Nurse: You're serious about it, aren't you? Man: Yeah. You mean you actually never want him to get out? - Never. Never. - ( Thunder crashes ) Never. Then why are we taking him up to Harden County if you're just... Because that is the law. Here we are. Since when do they let them wander around? Pull up to the main gate. - Shouldn't we... - Go on, move! Stop here. Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital and... Wait. ( Screams ) ( tires squeal ) ( panting ) Oh! Are you all right? - You all right? - Yes, I'm okay. He's gone. He's gone from here. The evil is gone. Right, I've got it. ( Door opens ) Don't forget to drop the key off at the Myers place. I won't. They're coming by to look at the house at 10:30. Be sure to leave it under the mat. Promise. ( Car starts ) Laufie! Hi, Tommy. - You coming over tonight? - Same time, same place. Can we make jack-o'-lanterns? - Sure. - And watch the monster movies? - Sure. - Will you read to me? - Can we make popcorn? - Sure, sure, sure. ( laughs ) You better hurry up. How come you're walking to school this way? - My dad asked me to. - Why? I have to drop off a key. - Why? - He's gonna sell a house. - Why? - Because that's his job. - Where? - The Myers house. Tommy: The Myers house? You're not supposed to go up there. - Yes, I am. - Uh-uh. That's the spook house. Just watch. ( Heavy breathing ) Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said awful stuff happened there once. Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade. I've got to go. See you tonight. - Bye. - Bye. J" I wish I had you all alone J". - J " Just the two of us... J" - ( Heavy breathing ) ( continues singing ) - I'm not responsible, Sam. - Oh, no. - I told them how dangerous he was. - You couldn't have. Two roadblocks and an all points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old. Well, he was your patient, Doctor. If precautions weren't strong enough, you should have told somebody. I told everybody! Nobody listened. There's nothing else I can do. You can get back in there and get back on that telephone and tell them exactly who walked out of here last night and tell them exactly where he's going. - Probably going. - I'm wasting my time. Sam, Haddonfield is 150 miles away from here. Now, for God's sake, he can't drive a car. He was doing very well last night. Maybe someone around here gave him lessons. ( Car starts ) (woman speaking over loudspeaker ) Teacher: And the book ends. But what Samuels is really talking about here is fate. You see, fate caught up with several lives here. No matter what course of action Collins took, he was destined to his own fate. His own day of reckoning with himself. The idea is that destiny is a very real, concrete thing that every person has to deal with. How does Samuels view of fate differ from that of Costaine's? Laufie? - Ma'am? - Answer the question. Oh, um, Costaine wrote that fate was somehow related only to religion, whereas Samuels felt that fate was like a natural element like earth, air, fire, and water. That's right. Samuels definitely personified fate. In Samuels' writing, fate is immovable like a mountain. It stands where man passes away. Fate never changes. - ( School bell ringing ) - ( Children shouting ) He's got a pumpkin. Yeah, how's the little witches? Yeah, you have a pumpkin. Leave me alone. Boys: He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you. The boogeyman is coming. - Leave me alone. - He doesn't believe us. Don't you know what happens on Halloween? Yeah, we get candy. - ( laughs ) - The boogeyman. The boogeyman. The boogeyman. The boogeyman. The boogeyman. The boogeyman. ( Boys laughing ) ( breathing heavily ) ( car starts ) He's on his way. You've got to believe me, Officer. He is coming to Haddonfield. Because I know him. I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him. If you don't, it's your funeral. ( Train crossing bell dinging ) ( train whistle blowing ) Girls: We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder. Can't hear us now, we'll yell a little louder. We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder. Oh, look at you. Look at all the books you have. You need a shopping cart to get home. ( laughs ) Girls: Yay, Haddonfield! Yeah, not funny. You know, it's totally insane. We have three new cheers to learn in the morning. The game is in the afternoon. I have to get my hair done at 5:00 and the dance is at 8:00. I'll be totally wiped out. I don't think you have enough to do tomorrow. Totally. As usual, I have nothing to do. It's your own fault and I don't feel a bit sorry for you. Hey, Lynda, Laurie. Why didn't you wait for me? We did. 15 minutes. You totally never showed. That's not true. Here I am. What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling. I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room. Exploring uncharted territory? - It's been totally charted. - We just talked. Sure, sure. Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him. He can't come over tonight. Thought you were babysitting tonight. The only reason she babysits is to have a place to... Shit. I have a place for that. I forgot my chemistry book. So who cares? I always forget my chemistry book, and my math book, and my English book, and my, let's see, my French book. Who needs books anyway? I don't need books. I always forget all of my books. I mean, it doesn't really matter if you have your books or not. Lynda: Hey, isn't that Devon Graham? I don't think so. I think he's cute. Hey, jerk. Speed kills. ( Tires squeal ) God, can't you take a joke? You know, Annie, someday you're gonna get us all into deep trouble. Totally. I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor. Well, are we still on for tonight? I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda. Oh, come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week. All right. The Wallaces leave at 7:00. I'm babysitting the Doyles. It's only three houses down. - We can keep each other company. - Oh, terrific. I've got three choices... watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw around, or talk to you. Boy, I was so mad. ( Chatter continues ) Want to go buy your own? You've bummed plenty off of me, girl. - What time tonight? - I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my little brother trick-or-treating. - Saving the treats for Bob? - Funny. See ya. - Bye. - Bye. Annie, look. Look where? Behind the bush. I don't see anything. The man who drove by so fast, that one you yelled at. Subtle, isn't he? Hey, creep. Laufie, dean. He wants to talk to you. He wants to take you out tonight. He was standing right there. Poor Laurie. Scared another one away. It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much. Guys think I'm too smart. I don't. I think you're wacko. Now you're seeing men behind bushes. Well, home sweet home. See you later. - Bye. - Bye. (wind blowing ) ( screams ) Excuse me, Laurie. Oh, Mr. Brackett. I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett. - I didn't mean to startle you. - That's all right. You know it's Halloween. I guess everyone's entitled to one good scare, huh? Yes, sir. Nice seeing you, sir. (girl laughs) ( laughter) - Trick or treat. - Trick or treat. (children laughing) Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition. (wind blowing ) ( phone ringing ) Hello? ( Crunching ) Hello? Who is this? ( Phone rings ) Hello? Annie: Why'd you hang up on me? - Annie? Was that you? - Of course. Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death. I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me? I thought it was an obscene phone call. Now you hear obscene chewing. - You're losing it, Laurie. - I already lost it. I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up at 6:30. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Just calm down. This is ridiculous. - Hurry up. - Hi. ( Music playing on radio ) We just have time. Yeah, Judith Myers. Myers. Row 18, plot 20. You know, every town has something like this happen. I remember over in Russellville, old Charlie Bowles about 15 years ago, one night he finished dinner and he excused himself from the table and he went out to the garage and he got himself a hacksaw. And then he went back into the house and he kissed his wife and his two children good-bye and then he proceeded... - Where are we? - Huh? Oh. It's right over here. Yeah, Myers. Judith Myers. I remember her. Couldn't believe it. Such a young boy. Are we lost? Why do they do it? Goddamn kids. They'll do anything for Halloween. - Whose grave was it? - Oh, I don't know. 18, 19... Judith Myers. He came home. Still spooked? I wasn't spooked. - Lies. - I wasn't. I saw somebody standing in Mr. Riddle's backyard. - Probably Mr. Riddle. - He was watching me. Mr. Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87. - Laurie: He could still watch. - It's probably all he can do. - What's the pumpkin for? - I brought it for Tommy. I figured carving a jack-o'-lantern would keep him occupied. I always said you'd make a fabulous Girl Scout. Thanks. For that matter, I might as well be a Girl Scout myself tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Dr. Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her. (coughing ) My dad! Get rid of this. ( Alarm ringing ) - ( coughing ) - Laurie, stop coughing. - What's the matter with you? - Oh, Jesus. Annie: Just be natural. There he is. Just be natural, Laurie. Hi, Annie. Laurie. Hi, Dad. What happened? - What? - What happened? Oh, somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids. You blame everything on kids. All they took was a Halloween mask, rope, and a couple of knives. Who do you think it was? It's hard growing up with a cynical father. - Aren't you gonna be late? - Huh? - I said aren't you gonna be late? - ( Alarm stops ) He shouts, too. BVG, girls. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. Sheriff. Pardon me, I'm Loomis. - Dr. Sam Loomis. - Lee Brackett. I'd like to have a word with you if I could. May be a few minutes. I've got to take care... it is important. - 10 minutes. - I'll be here. What's the matter with you? I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it. - No, he didn't. - He did. See the look on his face? He always looks like that. What are you gonna wear to the dance tomorrow night? I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie. You know, you could ask somebody. - No, I couldn't. - Sure, you could. All you have to do is go up to somebody and say, "You want to go to the dance?" You could do that. I couldn't. Well, you could ask Dick Baxter. He'd go out with you. I'd rather go out with Ben Tramer. Ben Tramer? I knew it. ( laughs ) So you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie? Shut up. He's cute. Ben Tramer. Shh. - Okay, see you later. - Bye. Kids: Trick or treat, give me something good to eat. Trick or treat, trick or treat, give me something good to eat. Trick or treat, trick or treat, give me something... ( knocks ) - Hi. - Man: Hi, Annie. - Come on in. - How you doing tonight? Annie: What time do you want her in bed? Woman: Be in bed by 9:00, okay? - Have a good night, dear. - Be a good girl. - Bye-bye. - Good-bye. Does anybody live here? Not since 1963 when it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted. They may be right. - Look. - What? - What is that? - It's a dog. It's still warm. He got hungfY- Come on. It could have been a skunk. Could have. A man wouldn't do that. This is no man. It happened in here. She was sitting right here. He could have seen her through this window. Standing on the lawn, he could have seen inside. You must think me a very sinister doctor. ( Chuckles ) Oh, I... I do have a permit. It seems to me you're just plain scared. Yes. Yeah, I am. I met him 15 years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding. Even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face with the blackest eyes. The devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him. And then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply evil. What do we do? He's been here once tonight. I think he'll come back. I'm going to wait for him. I still think I should notify the radio and television. No. If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner. They'll look for him in every house. Just tell your men to keep their mouths shut and their eyes open. I'll check back in an hour. "'How now, ' cried Arthur." 'Let no one pass this way without a fight.' "'Is that so?' said the knight in a bold and haughty manner." I don't like that story. I thought King Arthur was your favorite. Not anymore. Why do you keep them under there? Mom doesn't like me to have them. "Laser Man." "Neutron Man." I can understand why. "Tarantula Man." Laurie, what's the boogeyman? ( Phone ringing ) Doyle residence. Annie: It's me. Hi, Annie. What are you doing? Making popcorn. Having fun? Never mind. I'm sure you are. I have big, big news for you. (growling ) - ( barking ) - Oops. - Hold on a minute. - ( Barking ) Hi, Lester. I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog. ( laughs ) ( dog barking ) Lindsey, get this dog out of the kitchen right now. (Tv playing ) I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like. So what is this big, big news? What would you say if I told you that you were going to the homecoming dance tomorrow night? ( Scoffs ) I'd probably say you got the wrong number. Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him. Oh, Annie. Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't. How could you do that? I mean, how could you just call him? ( Kids laughing ) Laufie: What do you mean it was easy? I can't believe it. ( Kids laughing ) Please tell me you didn't. Oh, you didn't. - Laurie. - Oh, I'm so embarrassed. - I couldn't even face him. - The boogeyman is outside. - Laurie, he's out there. - Hold on. Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look. Tommy, there's nobody outside. Go watch TV. It's just Tommy. Oh, please tell me you didn't. How could you do that? Look, it's simple. You like him, he likes you. All you need is a little push. Well, it won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake. Shit! No, no. I just made a mess of myself. I've got to call you back. Oh, yuck. Lindsey. I need a robe. (Tv playing ) ( breathing heavily ) ( shatters ) Annie: This ain't ever coming out. (growling ) ( barking ) Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again. ( Dog whines ) Never mind. Guess he found a hot date. (jingle playing ) What about the jack-o'-lantern? After the movie. What about the rest of my comic books? After the jack-o'-lantern. What about the boogeyman? There's no such thing. Richie said he was coming after me tonight. Do you believe everything Richie tells you? No. Tommy, Halloween night, it's when people play tricks on each other. It's all make-believe. I think Richie was just trying to scare you. I saw the boogeyman. I saw him outside. There was nobody outside. - There was. - What did he look like? The boogeyman. We're not getting anywhere. All right, the boogeyman can only come out on Halloween night, right? - Right. - Well, I'm here tonight. I'm not about to let anything happen to you. - Promise? - Promise. Can we make the jack-o'-lantern now? Let's go. ( Pounds ) ( flips switch ) Oh, terrific. ( SighS ) Hello? Who's there? Paul, is this one of your cheap tricks? Guess not. No tricks for Annie tonight. ( Groans ) Lindsey! Lindsey, come out here! Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room. The door won't open. Man on TV: Spread out, everybody. We're gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing. Holy cats. Hey. Yeah, almost a perfect... ( phone ringing ) - We finally got one. - We found a flying saucer. Oh, Lindsey, get the phone. It's Paul. - ( Rattling ) - Lindsey! Lindsey! Paul, don't hang up. ( Phone ringing ) Hello? Hi, Lindsey. This is Paul. - Is Annie there? - Yes, she is. Get her for me, will you? She's washing her clothes. Look, just tell her it's me, okay? Okay. Annie, Paul called. Annie: Ow! - You locked yourself in. - I know. Pull my foot. I'm stuck. Oh. ( Clatters ) Now promise me you won't tell anybody about this. ( SighS ) ( phone ringing ) She got stuck in the window. She'll be right here. - Hello. - Paul: Hi, Annie. - Oh, hi, Paul. - Stuck, huh? All right, cut it out. It could happen to anyone. Sure, stuck in a window. Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions. My parents are gone. Oh, that's fabulous. When did they leave? - About half hour ago. - Oh, utterly fantastic. ( laughs ) Why don't you just walk over? You come and pick me up. Well, I can't come now. My clothes are in the wash. - Won't need 'em. - Oh, shut up, jerk. God, I've got a shirt on. That's all you ever think about. I think that's all you ever think about. That's not true. I think about lots of things. Now why don't we not stand here talking about them and get down to doing them? Man on TV: Lock your doors, bolt your windows, and turn off the lights. Don't go away 'cause here's a scene... I'm scared. Well, why are you sitting here with all the lights off? I don't know. Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul. I don't want to. Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other. I want to stay here and watch this. Okay. If I can fix it so you can watch TV with Tommy Doyle, - would you like that? - Yeah. Well, come with me. - ( Giggles) - Come on, hurry up. ( Iaughiﬂg ) ( breathing heavily ) ( doorbell rings ) Annie: Hi, Tommy. Hi. Come on in. We're making a jack-o'-lantern. Lindsey: I want to watch TV. Laurie: Annie, I'm in here. Man on TV: And now the horrifying conclusion to "The Thing." Oh, fancy. This has not been my night. I spilled butter all over my clothes. They're in the wash. I got stuck in the laundry room. I want to tell you something. I'd like you to call Ben Tramer and tell him that you were just fooling around. - I can't. - Yes, you can. No, he went drinking with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back till late. You'll have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul. Wait a minute. If you watch her, I'll consider talking to Ben Tramer in the morning. - Deal. - ( Laughs ) I thought Paul was grounded. He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so, okay? Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. The old Girl Scout comes through again. (whistling ) J " My Paul J". J " I give you all J". J " No keys J". J " But please, my Paul... J" (whistling ) J " Oh, Paul J". J " I can no longer stall J". J " Oh, Paul J". J " Oh, my Paul J". J " I can no longer stall J". J” Really, Paul J". J" My Paul... J” (whistling ) ( Squeaks ) ( Qasps ) ( gasping ) ( horn honking ) ( horn blaring ) ( horn blaring ) Attention, captain to crew. Stand by to reverse polarity. Standard class A security will be maintained upon landing. And until further notice, all hands will wear sidearms. That is all. Artificial gravity off. - Cut primary coils. - Primaries cut, sir. (whispering ) Lindsey. - Lindsey. - Where are you? ( Both scream ) Laurie, it's the boogeyman. I saw him outside. It's the boogeyman. He's outside. I saw the boogeyman. He's outside. - I saw the boogeyman. - Oh, Tommy, stop it. - But I really saw him. - You're scaring Lindsey. - He's over there. - Tommy, stop it. Now, there's nobody out there. There's no boogeyman. And if you don't stop all this, I'm gonna have to turn off the TV and send you to bed. Nobody believes me. I believe you, Tommy. ( Scoffs ) - I'm not afraid. - Bull. - I'm not. - Then go in. - Chicken. - Go ahead, Lonnie. Go in. (Whispers ) Hey. Hey, Lonnie. Get your ass away from there. - Jesus. - Are you all right? Yeah. Nothing's going on except kids playing pranks, trick-or-treating, parking, getting high. I have a feeling that you're way off on this. You have the wrong feeling. Well, you're not doing very much to prove me wrong. What more do you need? It's gonna take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes. I watched him for 15 years sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, looking past the wall, looking at this night. Inhumanly patient. Waiting for some secret silent alarm to trigger him off. Death has come to your little town, Sheriff. You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it. More fancy talk. Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is? Families, children, all lined up in rows up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse. They could be. All right, I'll stay with you here tonight, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him go. ( Lynda giggles ) Okay, this is what we're gonna do. First we go inside, right? Then we'll just talk a little. Then Annie will distract Lindsey. That's when we go upstairs to the first bedroom on the left. You got it? Okay, first I rip your clothes off. Don't rip my blouse. It's expensive, idiot. Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip Lindsey's clothes off. Yeah, I think I got it. Totally. ( Laughs ) ( cans rattle ) ( laughiﬂg ) No. No. ( Squeals ) Bob, put me down. Put me down. This is totally silly. Put me down. - Hey, it's totally dark. - Yeah. Annie. Annie, we're here. I wonder where they went. Oh, Annie probably took Lindsey out for something. ( Door closes ) Let's look for a note. Let's don't. ( MoanS ) ( howlS ) Oooh. - He's gonna get you. - No, he's not. Hey, nobody's getting anybody. Stop scaring each other. Everybody's having a good time tonight. All right, you guys, what's next? - Let's make more popcorn. - No, we've had enough. Why don't we watch the rest of the movie? - Yeah. - Yeah. ( Phone ringing ) Oh. Doyle house. Hi, Laurie. What's up? Just sitting down for the first time tonight. ( laughs ) Hey, is Annie around? I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul. Well, she's totally not here. She probably stopped off someplace. Have her call me when she gets home, though. I have Lindsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed. Okay. Later. - Have a good time. - We definitely will. Bye. Lindsey is gone for the night. - Hey, now that's wonderful. - ( Laughs ) (Tv playing ) (moaning ) ( phone ringing ) Lynda: Shit. Not again. I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing. - And I can't keep you interested? - Just answer the damn phone. I can't. What if it's the Wallaces? Get Annie in trouble, you know. ( Ringing SÉOPS ) Let's take it off the hook. (moaning ) Oh, fantastic. - Totally. - Yeah. - Want a beer? - Yeah. Is that all you can say? Yeah. Go get me a beer. I thought you were gonna get me one. - Yeah? - ( Chuckles ) I'll be right back. Don't get dressed. ( laughs ) Mmm. ( SighS ) ( door creaks ) Annie? Paul? Lynda, you asshole. Okay, Lynda. Come on out. Well, did you get my beer? ( Chuckles ) Cute, Bob. Real cute. See anything you like? ( laughs ) What's the matter? Can't I get your ghost, Bob? ( laughs ) All right, all right. Come on, where's my beer? Well, can't you answer me? Okay, don't answer me. Boy, are you weird. Well, I'm gonna call Laurie. I want to know where Paul and Annie are. This is going nowhere. ( Phone rings ) Finally. Hello. ( Qasping, moaning ) Hello? (moaning ) All right, Annie, first I get your famous chewing, now I get your famous squealing? ( Moaning, choking ) Annie, are you all right? (moaning ) Are you fooling around again? I'll kill you if this is a joke. Annie! Annie? (dialing ) ( ringil19 ) Sleep tight, kids. ( Doorbell buzzes ) Bob? Lvnua? Lvnua? Annie? Annie? Lvnua? Bob? All right, Annie. (thuds) All right, you meatheads, joke's over. Come on, Annie, that's enough. It most definitely stopped being funny. Now cut it out. You'll be sorry. ( Laurie whimpering ) ( Qasps ) ( sobbing, whimpering ) ( screams ) ( screams ) (whimpering ) ( sobbing ) ( screaming ) ( groans ) (whimpering ) Help! Somebody help me, please! Somebody help! Oh, God, help me! Please! Please help me! Oh! Help! Oh, God, help me, please! Hello? Hello? Hello? Help me! Can you please help me?! Please! Can't you hear me? Oh, God. Help! Help me, please! (whimpering ) The keys. Oh, the keys. Tommy! Tommy, it's me! Tommy! - Who is it? - Tommy, open up. It's me. Yeah, okay. Tommy, please! Tommy, hurry up! Tommy, please! - Tommy! - ( Pounding ) Tommy, please! - Tommy, get upstairs. - What is it, Laurie? Get Lindsey and lock the bedroom door. - I'm scared. - Do as I say! - It's the boogeyman, isn't it? - Hurry! ( No dial tone ) ( tapS ) Oh, no. Please, stop. Please. ( Qasps ) (crying) ( sniffles ) Where were you? I went to the Myers house. I found the car. He's here. - Where? - He's three blocks down. You go back around the back of the houses, I'll watch the front. - Go on! - All right. Tommy. Lindsey. Babies. We're gonna take a little walk. - Was it the boogeyman? - I'm scared. - There's nothing to be scared of. - Are you sure? - How? - I killed him. You can't kill the boogeyman. ( Kids scream ) Get in there. Come on, Tommy. Now lock the door. (whimpering ) ( shrieks ) (Qrunts) ( Qasps ) (thuds) ( panting ) - ( knocks ) - Tommy. Unlock the door. Come here. Just listen to me. I want you to go down the stairs and out the front door. I want you to go down the street to the Mackenzies' house. I want you to tell them to call the police and tell them to send them over here. - Laurie. - Do you understand me? - Yes. - Go do as I say. ( Screaming ) Tommy: Come on! Come on! ( Choking ) (gunshot) (whimpering ) ( breathing heavily ) ( gunshots ) (thuds) it was the boogeyman. As a matter of fact, it was. ( Music playing ) ( heavy breathing )
