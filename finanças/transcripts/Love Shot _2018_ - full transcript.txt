Oh, man, I love the smell of Korean barbecue. Yeah, it's considered one of the hottest spots in town. We might lose some customers because of the recent incident, but not enough to make a big difference. This was the table. I'm not an idiot, I can see the fucking duct tape. I'm sorry, Tony. Jesus, God, in their own place of business. That is... God, it takes some balls, huh? What about the trigger man? His back was to the security camera, and he wore a mask. God. Sounds professional. Yeah. Got any footage? Yeah. Holy shit. Hey, have you ever seen somebody move that fast, Slim? I've seen better. Was there business done with Jiho? As far as I know, yeah. Is anybody responding on a meeting tonight? None yet, but it's only been a few hours. We gotta make sure that everyone is cool with this move. My God. What about the chef? Oh, he's an asset. He won a culinary TV show. Oh, yeah? Which one? I don't know. Where do you think we can find him? I'm already in touch with him. The Korean's hit-man? No, the chef. All right, well... Drop down his salary, and give him a piece of our back-end business. How do I find him? You said you already knew how to find him. Who, the trigger man? No, the fucking chef! Yeah, yeah, he's young, so... I'm pretty sure we could persuade him to stick around. Okay, great. These pricks, man. They are not gonna be satisfied with my move in. We're gonna need this guy. The trigger man. Yes, the fucking trigger man. What is wrong with you, Slim? That wouldn't... I got it right, Tony. Wonder if he's got a signature dish. The chef. Yes, the chef... Jesus, God.

Um, you wanna meet up in, like, an hour? I just... have to... stop by my work really quick. How are you, Max? You look hungry. I'll have them bring you some Bibimbap. No, I just, I had a big bowl of Pho, so... I'm good. That's a Vietnamese dish. I'm full! I'm full, all right? Okay. What's the deal? Why do you got all these people in here? You're doing something different, or? We hired a young chef from one of those shows Elite Chef, uh, Ninja Chef, or Whatever the Fuck Chef. I'm good. Puts an organic spin on the food. Hipsters love it. Honestly. Try the Bibimbap. All right, I'll try the fucking Bibimbap. We didn't have this meeting on the books. Is there something in particular you wanted to discuss with us? That's kinda hard to explain. What's the matter? Hi. Hey. This place has the best selection. Oh, I know, right? Yeah. This is, like, my favorite place in the world, so... I try to spend as much time as possible here. So good. Yeah, it's one of my favorites. Do you have this? I used to, um... I need a new one, actually, which... Oh, I'll get it for you. What? No. Yeah, please, let me. Yeah, it's the least I can do, please. That's sweet of you. What's up, Max? You all set? Yeah, that's it. $20 for you. Oh, great. I don't have a bag, I'm sorry. That's okay, we're gonna wear it out. Out of 20? Great. Yeah. Thank you very much. You're doing great. Nice to see you. All right. Can I, um... buy you ice cream? Can I buy you an ice cream cone? Okay. Or something. Thank you. I thought you were just gonna propose to me or something. Maybe ice cream first. Yeah. The other night, when you walked into the karaoke bar? Yeah. Was that random, or... Uh, yeah, that was just like, uh, one of those kismet kind of, um... Um... Can I start over? I just don't wanna start by lying to you. If you have an issue, then speak up. There's no need to be coy. I'm, uh... Can we get some Soju? How about that? Let's get some Soju, please. Why do you have this? Uh, it was given to me by the people who hired me. Hired you for what? What if I don't take the job? We would have to hire an outside contractor. Why the hell wouldn't you do it? It's a woman. We're not asking you to kill a kid. Guess I'm just curious. Why her? Just do it. Did you put the contract on her? Ten fucking years, and I don't know how many hits. What's different about this one? Ooh, motherfucker. That actually kinda smells good. Try it. Oh, fuck. What did I tell you? It's fantastic. It's authentic. The chef grew up in Calabasas. This is your idea of some sick joke? That's not funny. I know this sound crazy. You don't have to stay here, I just thought I could help if you'd let me, and... I didn't want you to get hurt. What about the girl? We can't pretend we didn't have this conversation. Well, here's what I'm thinking about that. You want to get your outside contractor? Go ahead. Maybe he'll be better. I doubt it. Maybe he won't ask fucking questions. But the point here, gentlemen is I know too much. So... You can't get rid of me at this point. You don't talk to us like that. We're done here. I guess there's, um... nothing left to say, then. Oh, that was... That was a great job with the Bibimbap. I don't need this shit. Karen, hold on. Karen! Fuck. Fuck. Is this real? Don't have any idea who would want you dead? You said you could help me. How? Listen, if we can just go back to my place, like, No funny business implied, I'm just saying. We use it as home base, and we can figure out whatever the hell to do next. I think that's our best shot right now, I really do. Yeah, okay. Okay. I could use a drink, uh... Yeah, me too. Should we put something on? Yeah, sure. It's the Turner Brothers. Um, do you wanna, like, come inside? Cool. Wow. What? Um... I, uh... just wasn't really expecting this. Oh, what were you expecting, then? Oh, my God. Oh, this? Whoa. Yeah, it's... So many! Just a little, you know, hobby of mine. Can I take your, um, coat for you? Sure. Cool. Thank you. Of course. It's a wonderful coat. Uh, would you like a drink? Can I make you a drink? It's really smooth. Mmm. It's nice. Yeah. Uh, should I put, um... like, some music on? Should I put a record on? Sure, okay. Okay, cool. Oh, vinyl mix-tapes! Hm? You're gonna love it. All right, picture this with me, if you will. Short guy, Pershing Square stop. Uh-huh? He's wearing a Shriners' cap, three-legged poodle, You give him 25 bucks, and this guy... will make you a vinyl mix-tape. Uh-huh? And, um, yeah, you might dig this one here. This is my favorite song!

I like you, Daniel, I really do. Hey, you gotta tell me how that is. Trying to decide if I wanna keep the chef or not. Go ahead. Give it a whirl. Mmm. That's fantastic. Settled! We keep the fucking chef! You ever play Dreidel? Uh, no. When are the others supposed to arrive? It's funny... They teach you how to gamble about the same time your dick gets hard. No wonder we got a fucking gambling problem in this country. Are they even coming? Come on. Let's play Dreidel. Look, I don't have a lot of time, Tony. No, of course you don't. It seems your associates decided not to show up. Now, I think they're trying to make statement with their absence. I'll get to the point. I want the cash and your games to move through here. What about the girls? I'll let them go, I don't give a shit about prostitutes. It's a dirty business. The chase of the fuck is half the fun anyway Don't you think? Well, they're not gonna like that. I don't give a flying fuck what they don't like. Don't you see? It'll look like we're cleaning up the place. No one will be looking for a cash laundry business. Why are you guys so resistant to having your money cleaned? Well, cleaned by a Jew. And, prey-tell, Daniel, what the fuck are you? Agnostic. Were you "bar mitzvah" -ed? Come on. Let me see your dick. I'm joking. One spin. Let's play Dreidel, shall we? If it lands on the Gimel, you join me in the new venture, lands on the Hei, then I keep the whores, and everything stays the same. Lands on the Shin, and I take the games from you. Lands on the Nun, then... Nothing. Oh, too bad. Goodbye, Daniel. Sloppy. Very sloppy. Make sure you clean this place up, cause we got the health inspector coming tomorrow. Okay? Yeah. Can we please get a professional to do this next time? Yeah, get the fucking chef. How about that? Don't get smart with me. I'm sorry, Tony.

Why do they want you dead, Karen? I don't know. I don't know who they are. Wow. Um, Kar, we should probably figure out who wants you dead, then, okay? Jiho didn't order the contract, so it wasn't the Koreans. I'm at a loss. I got nothing, you know? Why don't we just leave town? And do what, Karen? I don't know, something different? Maybe go north. To a small town. Find jobs at a local bar, and... listen to good music all day. Honey, and start a karaoke night, or what? You wanna be a lounge duo now? I don't know fucking show tunes.

Oh, like you were, um, you're a domey? I didn't sleep with any of them. I, it doesn't, what do I... But some domeys do, though, right? Yeah, I know. Okay, well, more power to you, I don't... You know, like... Did you ever have trouble with any of the guys, or... No, no, I got along great with all those guys. I don't know, Karen. Wanna get out of here? Like, you really want to get out of here? Yeah. All right, then... I just... need money, and I just need to pick up another gig. That's all. But you killed your boss. Yeah, but sadly, darling, there are... plenty of contracts left in the city. There's this girl. We don't know much, but we know she likes karaoke. No, no, no. It's better if I don't, okay?

What the fuck is this? I don't know. Uh, sure you do. I've been tailing you all day, remember? Here to see about a job? Are you an idiot? Yeah, okay. Close the door. I just like went back by the old stomping grounds around the restaurant, just to kind of, vibe it out, see what's going on. Yeah. And it turns out, there's this older Jewish hood who's coming down from the valley, and he thinks he's gonna come in and scoop up all Jiho's business, so... So... What can I do for you? Well, I heard you ran into a little resistance trying to move in here, so I just wanted to offer my service to you gentlemen, and see if, uh, I could help clean up. I think we got it under control. Mm, I think your guy's a little sloppy, to be honest. That very well may be. So, how do you see yourself improving upon the situation? Well, I know these guys. I've worked with them for years, so I know their habits, I know their patterns, I know their haunts, and most importantly, I know the ones that are gonna give you a hard time cause they have a relationship with Jiho. Are you Jiho's guy? Oh, you know, don't kiss and tell. Naturally. Are you able to handle all of this fairly quickly? For the right amount of money, anything can be quick. Lay it out. All right, well, your boy kinda botched the jump there, so now, they know you're coming. He could've planned it out, but it is what it is. We'll let bygones be bygones. Give me about a week, and I'll clean it up for you. It's all said and done. And then, I just gotta... You know, you gotta pay me 50, so... My, my, sir, you are a professional. What's to stop him from taking a contract on you after he's done? Cause I'm retired after I'm done. That's why I need the money upfront, too. Come again? Well, you know, I do my job right, what's left for me? All the work's gone, so... Let me just clean up and get out of your way. I take a little indefinite vacation. A Romantic Ronan. How sweet. Well, you know, Lone Ronan plus one. Got a... young lady in the side-car there. What's his name? Tony Kaufman. Really funny guy. Total mench. Love him. Don't you think that's a little risky? Not really, I mean... The thing is none of these people know me, so I got the anonymity thing going for me. And I'm not attached, so if we gotta cut and run at any point, we can just get out of here. Well, if that didn't work out for you, I'm sure we can find you a lot of work around here. I greatly appreciate that, sir, but I think I got my future set. What is this? Chips. What kind of... They're Tony's. Pork chips. They're shit. Yeah, I'm kosher, I don't do that. So we got a deal here? Tell you what, Tommy Bahama, Buy yourself a new shirt. What's your name? Max. Don't worry.

I was told that, um... I was mauled by a tiger. Hm. Mm-hmm. Who told you that? Some fortune-teller. Yeah. Do you have any birth marks? Yeah, I just got a little one.

They just pull the rug out from under you, they rip your fucking heart out, they step on it, they chew it up, and then, they spit it in your face. It's a fucking magic trick. Fucking bitches, unbelievable! Oh, Christ. I thought mine was dead, right? She comes traipsing in here, and tries to pay me off with my own fucking money. Can you believe that? Tony, I mean... Just tell me where to find her, and you never gotta think about it again. My guess is she's trying to split town. I'd check Union Station. Studying her face? She really is quite beautiful, isn't she? Are you laughing? No, I'm not, I'm sorry. No, you are laughing. You're fucking laughing. What the fuck are you laughing at? Tony, she reminds me of someone, that's all. No, she does not. You are fucking bullshitting me. What, you fucking bigot? You think she's some sort of fucking ethnic joke? I don't like bigots, Max! She looks like the girl that left me, that's all I'm saying!

Okay. Fuck this. I'm sick of playing roles in other people's lives. For you, for Tony, for those men in those karaoke bars. You know what? Just shoot me. Do what you were hired to do. Or, you can come with me, but if you come with me, we are partners. You don't get to call the shots anymore. Because look where it got us. Please. Fuck Tony, and fuck K-Town. You're really thinking about this? No, baby, no. It's just, if we do this, then we have nothing left. We are back to square one. What are we gonna do about money, I mean... Enough about the money! We'll figure it out as we go! Are you sure you want me to go with you? About as sure as you are. Hey, Max. Shit. Oh, fuck, Slim! You asshole. Oh... Let's go! Let's fucking go! God. What the fuck? I'm sorry, he startled me, Tony. I didn't see him there. Jesus, God. You know, we just came up to ask you if we could, you know, like, follow you. You know, shadow. Looks like we came to the right place. But it seems like you're in the middle of something here. Yeah, well, I'm a fucking professional. Yeah, you are. And a good one. And such a character. Go ahead. We're never gonna let her do this to anyone else ever again. I know you fucked her. I can smell it on you, I can smell it on both of you. Let me tell you something, pal. I just wanted to see you pull the fucking trigger. Because I know you loved her. Drop the gun. Drop it! I want to kill you so fucking bad, but what difference would it make, huh? Just let me go, Tony. And you never gotta fucking see me again. It don't work that way. I'm the last person you're ever gonna fucking see. Ah! Can we go now? Yeah, let's go. You meant to graze me, right? Yeah, of course, I did! We need to work on our communication. Okay, I'm gonna work on that, I promise. Jesus. Ow! What the fuck? We're even now. Ah! Fuck you!
