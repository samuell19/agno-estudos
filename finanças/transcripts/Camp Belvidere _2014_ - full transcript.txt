I've been working on things. I read the book you gave me. AND? I've never read anything like it, But it's so true, you know. As they say that man was born, but it came in the body of a woman. Much of this is true, but in some ways it still seems challenging. For many people, yes. How did you feel? Renovated. I have seen so many of my thoughts written on those pages. But sometimes, to cut the heart. Why cut the heart? Because now it's not so different. You still have to adjust. Even choosing our own way we end up sacrificing something. One way or another. I know what you mean. I do not think you know. People assume that a woman My age does not know what he wants. And it may be that you do not have your experience But I can trust my instincts because I know you are not blinded by fear. You think I act out of fear? Is not that why you gave me the book? To make me feel better about having big dreams. I gave the book because I thought I would like it. To make me feel better about being an impotent girl? - No, not like that. - To show me that it does not matter what you do. I can not be like you. That I can never have you? - Why would the world knock me down? - I promise you'll try.

I should not have said that. I love you. I Love. But I'm not a child. You've involved me and now is afraid to take what we have. - You're scared ... - What we have? What do you think we have? You know what. What we have is a friendship, nothing more. I'll be like this with or without you. Why are you trying so hard to get away? I have no idea. You have no idea how lonely you've been. You know, sometimes I do not think so. I would know what to do if someone loved me. Because I'm so used to being alone. And I think... Well, I just think I adore you. And I do not want your life to be a struggle. You have to believe that I can only Doing right with you as a friend. I can not be your friend. Why do you decide who you are? Why are you suffering? I'm hurt too. Every time he insists in treating me as a child. Whenever you try to fix me. But you know what? You can not fix me. Just as she did not fix herself. No, I can not. I can not be your friend. I can not. I can not be near you. No. Do not leave me again. I do not want to lose you. Will you come tonight? Yes. Hi. Hi. I'm glad to see you.
