The Great Departure is a SunChild production. A Martial Raysse fable. We'll begin with News Without Borders with an exclusive interview with President Charles El Rachid. The Chief of State declared he'd nationalize good will and rally the Socialist camp. Socially, optimism prevails this week. Thanks to the schools' broadcast service, you'll see a special reportage on the Portocello Film Festival. Carla Mambo, our viewers can see that which I'll call a gaze of a distinguished, melancholic, exiled countess. The heroine of your new film Juanita and the Stars made that look unforgettable. She's pretty, huh? For nothing at all. I don't cost you much. People don't look. We get by. We find lots of things, I'm telling you. Cheap! Look at that one's face! She thinks she's so pretty. So fussy. So fake. No way! It was hard to get rid of that whole pile of bodies. I crawled under a great orange tree on the banks of a nearby stream. That's all I have to say about that. I think she's nice. And Italian women... Italian or not, I'd have said: "Here we cultivate the roses of love, "the violet of humility, the lily of virginity, "the boletus of courage..." A little imagination, please! I'm old school, but she went to school too. It's like dressing, people have no ideas. I like modern things, but not just anything. Thought-out modern. Classic modern. Don't talk of oppression, agitators, nothing at all. I'm gonna play Flight of the Bumblebee by the Russian Rimsky-Korsakov. Don't say it, you've gotta do it. That must be to warm up his fingers. That guy's still really clever. At least he's handsome. I read that he's had problems. - Oh, listen. - Let's go! The game's starting. Your dirty cat again! Could be nothing else! How surprising. Go to hell! Hello in there! Need a hand? A soldier? A general? A general! And his summer clothes. And tennis, the sport! You see this? Innocence! Cain? So, how are you? It's over. I threw it in the rubbish. She's sad. You understand? She's very sad. - Come, I'll take you to heaven. - To heaven? There are lots of animals. It's no fun living with the Mona Lisa. There are problems daily, welfare benefits, bus tickets... Anyway, we're off to heaven now. We'll go see Mr Nature. He's a funny guy. You'll see what he's like, you'll meet him. I don't know what you are. Are you a crazy boy or girl? Well, I'm both. Both'? That's good. That's why you're innocent. You know, Cain, I'm all alone. You're my only friend. Just me'? Your only friend? Cats have no friends, kid. That's impossible. You're truly innocence. Cats have no friends. But I can scratch you. You're mean! Mean cat! But I can become nice again. See? You don't like me anymore? I'll take you to heaven now. Pig-headed cat. I'm gonna sunbathe naked in the back of your car. You're right. Go on! Sunbathe. Good. Wake me when I'm in heaven. It's not a car, it's a boat. I'll wake you when we get to heaven. Monday morning, the king, his wife and the prince. Came to my house... To shake my hand. Monday morning his wife, the king... How's your song go? Heaven! We're almost in heaven! Heaven! Heaven. Oh, Cain, no, listen! It's the Great Departure today, the great meeting! We have to go, Cain. Don't be an idiot. Listen. Listen, let me go, Cain. We must go to the Great Departure, Cain! Cain, listen to me! - Let's go. - Don't be an idiot. No, I'm not being an idiot. I've a meeting, we'll miss the Great Departure. Come along my good, little cow. Don't be an idiot. I told you: stay with me! Come on, stay with me. I know Mr Nature, he's got time. I must see the girl. We can't leave her like that. Come back. Let's go! What are you doing? Listen, wait. Take this and go and see Mr Nature. - Cain? - He's already there. Let's go. Is he speaking to them? So he's determined. We're making the big trip. Hurry up. Grab all the kit. Time's getting short. We've only a few hours to get ready. My clear child, there's no reason to celebrate. So, Mrs Nature? - Hello, Cat. - How are you? Cards? Patience? Come. Coffee. May I phone? OK? Operator? Hi, darling, how are you? Pass me Barbara please. Automatic international here. You gotta speak to Carlo. He's to bring the Swedish girl. He brings the Swede, yes. And the Norwegian from the other night. Of course. Yes, the Norwegian. Because it the Great Departure. Everyone's leaving, it's over. Everyone's leaving, yes. The Great Departure, I said. Bring some brainy guys along. - Stop! - We'll need scientists. Stop your rubbish. I have to talk to him. Mr Nature, he still lives in that shack'? Doesn't want you any more'? He lives in the shack, I'll talk to him. Mr Nature! Did you announce the Great Departure? You could have spoken to them again. Here we could have stayed in peace for a while. We're not going to die immediately. You understand? I don't want to. I want to live! But if I refuse to follow you? I want to stay in my head. If I wanted just once to keep my head for myself. We're finishing this. You understand? Do you trust me'? I've no flings, no affairs. No lover. Tranquility, you understand? Conversing quietly with someone. Simple words for tranquil things. You twist everything up. Everything. We must think of simple things. In any case, when I saw that cat, I knew death had knocked at my door. Look. Is that plastic? Cool. Who's this guy'? That one's my brother. I'm with you, you gave me a blue circle. That's a good thing, we're in deep trouble. - We're in danger. - But how'? - We were followed. - We have to hide. Too late, here they are. - Come on you! - Wait. Ok, let's get going. We'll be back. You're a really strange guy. Hey, you. He's gotta leave. Leave! That's it guys, we're off. A gun. So that's what you've been doing! The truck's ready and there's no time to lose. The mountains hold but blood and cries. You're always looking for trouble. Take a hike. Keep it, it's pretty. Didn't you know? Marriage preparations? Mona Lisa's going nuts. She's marrying Mao. Tidy up. Mona Lisa's coming, everything must be tidy. I recognise you. You're Mona Lisa. Are you getting married? My life has changed a lot. I chose the sagacity of a passion free life. Look, the cat. The determination of this stranger moved me. Where are you going, little girl? - To the raft of hope. - The raft? Leave me, Cat! Do you think we'll all die'? Yesterday the flax flowered, wheat filled the stores. Everything's changed, the children... Penis is dead, live the penis. Your ancestors never saw the like. From the first dust to this clay. - What's happening? - We're waiting for Mr Nature. - Where's Mr Nature? - In the field. I'm going to see. Hurry, we're leaving. Forgive us our sins... as we forgive others. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Two plus two make four. It's such a beautiful clay. When the moon's gone, I walk with my flute toward the desert dunes.
