[majestic music] [music fades] [birds chirping] My name is Maurice Buckmaster. I've been asked to say a foreword to this story. My only claim to do so is that, as their commanding officer, I knew intimately all the volunteers who formed the French section of Special Forces. The Firm, as we called it sometimes. And I know, therefore, that this story is a true one. The people you'll see on the screen are playing, as accurately as human memory permits, the parts of men and women who are or were then alive. Captain Peter Churchill, alias Pierre Chauvet, alias Pierre Chambrun, known to us as "Raoul" a British officer, was one of the first to land in France in 1941, by somewhat unconventional means. Under the very noses of an alert Gestapo, one of the best radio operators, and certainly one of the bravest we ever had, sent his messages to London. Lieutenant Alec Rabinovitch, alias Guy Lebouton, alias Gérard Lebouton. "Arnaud" was the name we knew him by. Arnaud was captured and executed by the Germans in 1944. These two men, Raoul and Arnaud, together with Odette, were among the 400 men and 38 women who volunteered for this hazardous work in France. [radio] …was destroyed solely because the men… [Maurice] In her own words, Odette was a very ordinary woman. [radio reporter] At the recent Combined Operations raid on Bruneval, much secret equipment was carried back to London. This was made possible by photographs and models. Oh, please do not turn it off, Mrs. Ward. The news is all over. That's the postscript. -Yes, but I want to hear the postscript. -Oh, all right. [radio] …and particularly France and Belgium. So, remember, if you have spent holidays abroad, look at those holiday snapshots again. Don't send the photographs yet, but write to the Admiralty, and state quite clearly where they were taken. The envelope should be marked "Photographs" and addressed to The Admiralty, London, SW1. I will repeat that. The Admiralty, London, SW1. [Maurice] A mistake in the address, and our fate is often bound up in such things, was the reason why, on a spring morning in 1942, Odette found her way to my office in Orchard Court, Portman Square. Your slight inaccuracy in addressing these photographs to the War Office and not to the Admiralty may prove to be of value to us. What do you mean? How would you like to go to France? Go to France? Why, how can people go to France now? There are ways and means, you know. You mean to tell me that people are being sent to France by the War Office? By the War Office? Good heavens, no. They're a respectable institution. They wouldn't do things like that. Now, let me explain. You're a Frenchwoman. You were born in France and lived there until you married and came to England. We need the help of people like you. But I must warn you, if you do decide to join us, your work will be highly dangerous. But I do not think that I am qualified to do dangerous work. I am not clever. I am a very ordinary woman. A mother with three children. Your children, of course, must be considered. But we badly need volunteers who know and love France, and who would, if needs be, lay down their lives for France. [Maurice] It was in September 1942, that Odette Sansom, alias Madame Odette Métayer, number S23, known to us as "Lise", completed her training. For her bravery and bearing when in the hands of the enemy, Odette was awarded the George Cross, the highest British honour that can be bestowed on any woman. This is her story. [in French] Goodbye, Lise. -Good luck. -[in French] Goodbye, thank you. And bring me back a bottle of cognac. Oh, only one? Well, there are 15 instructors. [in French] Goodbye! You tell us you married an elderly husband. Is he still alive? No, he died in 1936. Pneumonia. -I then went to live at Le Touquet. -Address, please? 7, Rue Victor Hugo. When the war came, I went to the south of France. -Address? -37, Rue Clemenceau, St Raphaël. Sounds all right, sir. Yes. Yes, I think so. Now, where were you in December 1941? December? In December, I was at Cannes. The Hôtel Pension des Alpes. -10, Rue de l'Isère. -Good. Well, that's your cover story. Never vary that in any respect. Now, your code number is S23. And your field name, to us, is Lise. Just Lise, always. Yes. [in French] My name is Lise. No, thank you, I do not smoke. Now, Lise, for months on end, you'll be living a gigantic lie. Waking or sleeping, you'll have to be on your guard all the time. And if you slip up, there is not a thing we can do to save you. I understand. Here's your French ration book, Lise. It's now October '42, so the coupons for September have been cut out. -And your false identity card. -And these are your medicines. This one will give anyone you don't like a pretty bad tummy ache for 24 hours. Drop it in his coffee. And that one is a stimulant for yourself, if ever you need one. Don't mix those two up. Now, this is your lethal tablet. In case you get into a jam and you can't get out. Swallow that and… -You think of everything, mon commandant. -We have to. Well, that's about all, I think. -[in French] Goodbye, Lise. -[in French] Goodbye. Oh… Major Buckmaster, would you do something for me? Would you have these letters posted, one each month, from Scotland? I have put the dates on the back. Yes, we'll arrange that. -Good luck, Lise. -Thank you, Jack. [Maurice] Oh, Madame Métayer. One thing I forgot to ask. Have you any children? No, mon commandant. I have no children. This is Odette. Thank you. I am very well. Reverend Mother, I have to go to Scotland. If I am not here for the holidays, my aunt will arrange for the children to go somewhere safe. Yes, I do not want them to be in London. It is too dangerous. [bell tolls] Here they are, on their way to class. You'd like to speak to them, I'm sure. Just a moment, I'll call them. No! No, no, please. I couldn't do that. [reverend mother] Sister Therese. Could Francoise, Lily and Marianne speak to their mother? -She's on the telephone. -[woman] Yes, Reverend Mother. [bell tolls] [Francoise] Marianne, Lily, Mummy's on the telephone! -They're just coming. Here they are. -[child] Mummy! Mummy! -Hello, Mummy! -Hello! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Francoise, I am just going away to Scotland. In the FANYs. Yes, darling, you have seen them, driving cars for officers. That's right. Now, Francoise, I want you to be a good girl and to look after Lily and Marianne. And you will work hard, won't you, darling? You know your first report was not very good. Yes, I hated arithmetic too, but, you will try to learn it. All right. Goodbye, Francoise. Hello, Lily. And I love you with all my heart too. Darling… Darling, you will try to stop biting your fingernails? Oh, she put some bitter stuff on them, did she? Does she? Goodbye, Lily. Hello, my sweetie pie. Have you, darling? Does she shut her eyes when she goes to sleep, like a real baby? How lovely. Goodbye, my darling and… God bless you, baby. Oh, no, Marianne, do not cry! [Odette sobs] Do not cry. -[in French] Goodbye, Jan. Thank you. -[in French] Goodbye. Good luck! [waves crashing] [in French] Who are you? [in French] My name is… [in French] Who are you? [in French] My name is Lise. -[in French] I am Jacques. -[in French] Hello Jacques. I will take you to a fisherman's home in Cassis, so you can rest until the train. -[in French] Thank you. -Then I am to take you to Toulon. The German troops are there. There, I will put you on the train for Cannes. Raoul will be waiting for you outside the station. When you see him, go up and say, [in French] "Excuse-me, sir. Mister Chauvet?" [Odette in French] "Excuse-me, sir. Mister Chauvet?" [Jacques in French] Okay. [train announcement in French] [in French] Excuse-me, sir. Mister Chauvet? -[in French] Hello, Lise. -[in French] Hello. My instructions were to report to the Comte de Carteret at the Villa Bleue. Yes, yes, I know all about that. Why have the orders of London been disregarded? Shall we go into that a little later? Meanwhile, welcome to Cannes. [seagulls squealing] Well, your billet's up here, Lise. Number 21. Ring the top bell twice and ask for Catherine. She's expecting you. If I were you, I should get some sleep. -Thank you. I'm not at all tired. -Aren't you? After being tossed about in a felucca for ten days, you ought to be. When you've had some sleep, come to the salon de beauté in the Croisette, number 36, and ask for Madeleine. -[in French] Goodbye, Lise. -[in French] Goodbye, Raoul. Oh, by the way, Lise… The Villa Bleue was raided yesterday by the Gestapo. It's quite possible that they're waiting there to pick up any callers. [seagulls squealing] [horn honks] [car engine droning] [in French] Careful, Arnaud, the lookout car is doing the rounds. -[in French] Keep an eye on the road. -[in French] Okay. [in French] I have to decode this message, it's urgent. [in French] Okay. [car door shuts] -[pigeons cooing] -[water rustling] [relaxed chatting] -[in French] Hello, madam. -[in French] Hello, sir. [in French] I need an appointment for my wife. -[in French] One moment, sir. -[in French] Thank you. Lise will call and ask for Madeleine. Lise. -Hiya, Paul. -Ah, Raoul. She's got quite a mind of her own, has Lise. Too much? The whole art of playing this racket is to be entirely inconspicuous. Yes, Lise has quite a lot to learn. Now, I want you to take this money to Jean. He's starting something in Toulouse. And be sure you get a receipt. -Still nothing through from London? -We'd soon know from Arnaud if there were. Hey! [in French] Come here! [in French] Papers! [in French] Again! It's the second time today. [in French] Try to be polite and hurry up. Come on. [in French] Here. [in French] Pretty good photo, isn't it? [in French] Do you want my wife's too? Oh, hiya. Have a good sleep? -Yes, wonderful. -Good. Now perhaps you'll be a little less intolerant. -I'm sorry. -That's all right. -Have you had some coffee? -No, they had not any. You'll find some stewing in the back room. Help yourself. [in French] Thank you. -What about you? -Yes, I'll have a cup. [water trickling] Raoul, I got through! After three weeks, I got through! -No! -Six messages from London, six messages! -Let's have them. -Yes, in a minute. What do those fools in London think they're doing? Three weeks and not a goddamn message! Don't swear. There's a lady in the next room. -Pretty? -Not bad. Come on! Let's have these messages. Oh. This is Arnaud. This is Lise. She just arrived in the field. [in French] Hello, Arnaud. -How's Buck? -He's very well. I'm sure he's well. What does he do all day? Sits in that black bath of his, reading detective stories. But then why can't he send me the messages? Three goddamn weeks! You'd better get another one for Arnaud. He was born thirsty. No, no, no. Thank you very much. I can't find these ruddy messages. I put them somewhere when I was stopped by the flics. -Come on, turn out your pockets. -Yes. I've lost them. Were they decoded? Every one of them. Come on, let me have a look. -Now admit you're a B.F. -What's the trouble? I got them through, didn't I? I got them through, didn't I? [relaxing music] Raoul, do you that think Buck sent me to France to sit in cafés and to watch the girlfriends of the collaborators promenading their poodles? Course he did. Didn't he tell you? But, Raoul, when am I going to begin work? My orders were to go on to Auxerre. Yes, you've mentioned that before. Lise, I'd like you to know, sitting here in Cannes is not my idea of fighting a war any more than it's yours. Our job is to help organize French resistance. Does it matter whether we do it in Cannes, Auxerre, or Polperro? Oh, I suppose not, but… meanwhile, am I to do nothing but to carry messages, to find food. -Yes, yes, have a marc. I'll get you one. -Oh, no, thank you. I do not drink. You don't drink? You don't smoke. So far, I haven't heard you swear. Well, never mind, we'll soon change all that. Lise, you've been here for ten days, and I've been sizing you up. -You've… You've been sizing me up? -Yes. I think you'll do. -I'm going to give you a job. -That is very kind of you. You may not think so when I tell you what it is. It's to go to Marseille. I warn you, the town is stiff with Gestapo, German soldiers and Vichy police. And it's no small job. It's to pick up the plans of the port and to get them away to London. -Will you do it? -But of course. Good. As a woman, you have a better chance than a man. When you get to Marseille, go to the café on the waterfront called Oscar's. It's a pretty low dump, but you'll find Jacques there. [train screeching] [Jacques in French] Raoul thinks so too. [in French] Is she pretty? [Jacques in French] I've only seen her in the dark. Here she is now. -[birds chirping] -[water rustling] Oscar will leave a suitcase here. The plans are inside it. Oscar will tell you where to locate Michel. Bonjour. [in French] Sea urchins, ma'am? [in French] Yes, please, Oscar. Michel will be waiting quai des eaux vives …on the low tide. On the low tide? -[in French] Yes. -Then I must sleep tonight in Marseille. Oscar, where is a safe hotel? No hotel in Marseille is safe. But I know a good house. No, not "good". Hôtel du Paradis. Say Oscar sent you. [soft suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [knocks on door] [door opens] -[in French] Good evening, ma'am. -[in French] Good evening, ma'am. [in French] I've been sent by Oscar. Oscar? [in French] Oscar is a good friend. [in French] You need somewhere to stay? [in French] Exactly. You know what kind of a house this is? -I think so. -[woman] You think right. The house is full of German soldiers, many are deserters, but I will see that you are not disturbed. I am most grateful. But why? Am I not a Frenchwoman too? Oh, a room with a key will cost you 50 francs. Marie! Take madame to number ten. [in French] No, leave it. [in French] Thank you. [in French] Good evening, ma'am. [in French] Good evening, ma'am. Good night. [suspenseful music continues] [loud rhythmic footsteps] [in German] Detachment, halt! [suspenseful music intensifies] [aggressive knocks] [aggressive knocks] [soft suspenseful music] [loud knocking] [loud knocking] [in German] Open up! We've come to search for deserters! [door rattles] [in German] Go on up. [aggressive rhythmic footsteps] [in French] That's my room. [in French] That's my niece's room. She has scarlet fever. [loud bangs] [soldiers arguing] [loud bangs] [door slams shut] I know what Marseille is like these days and she should have got back long ago. You're very callous. My dear Madeleine, Lise can only learn by experience. Perhaps Oscar was away, or perhaps she's fallen off the jetty. We shall find out, sooner or later. [children chatting and screaming] [people chatting in French] [train clacking on tracks] I tell you, it would take a man of ten years' experience to do that job properly. And you, you send a girl! Would you mind not pointing that at me? It might go off. You give her a big job too soon. -You're a fool. -Oh, shut up! She's got guts, determination and common sense. If she's been picked up, it's just too bad. We shall hear from Oscar soon enough. Now, you'd better get along and send those off. -You make me sick. -Have one of these. It'll make you sicker. [seagulls squealing] [water rustling] [seagulls squealing] [door clicks and rattles] You've done it? Good girl, Lise. Good girl. London's screaming for those plans. Well, they are on the way. Any difficulty in locating Michel? No. He was there, on the minute. I want you to take this up to Arnaud. -Now? -Yes. And see that he gets it off to Buck at once. I suppose you do realise that I have not slept for two nights? Mmm? When you've delivered that you'll be able to sleep your head off. I don't mind telling you, I've been worried sick. Lise. Nice work. Nice work. [door clicks shut] [typewriter clacking] Marseille? [in German] For goodness sake! How can they be so stupid? [in German] I'm dealing with idiots! Yes, "idiots"! [in German] What does she look like? [typewriter clacking] [in German] She's pretty, is she? [in German] How old? How old! [in German] Yes, of course. [in German] Yes, I'll come tomorrow. [in German] Goodbye. [in German] Could you get me the Buckmaster file? Unmeister? Buckmaster! Your English is bad. But you are a very good secretary. Thank you, Herr Oberst. I am leaving tomorrow for Cannes. Kindly order me a car. -[in German] Understood? -[in German] Very well, Colonel. Come here. The heat's on. They raided my flat and Oscar was picked up last night in Marseille. We've got to clear out. [hasty footsteps] [engine droning] [speaking in German] [chatter and arguing] [arguing continues] -Hurry up with that. -What about Arnaud? He'll be here any moment. Arnaud, mon vieux, we're on our way out. Go to Toulouse and work in the Labelles' house at Montréjeau until I send Jacques for you. Okay, but where are you going to go? Lise and I will catch the night train to Annecy. It's a charming spot, Annecy. You'll love it. -It's up in the mountains. -Mountains? But how can I transmit through a lot of ruddy mountains? I hate mountains. [birds chirping] [relaxing piano music] [door shuts loudly] -[in French] Hello, sir. -[man in French] Hello, sir. -[in French] Hello, ma'am. -[in French] Hello. [in French] Two coffees and cognacs, please. Jacques. -[in French] Hello, Lise. -[in French] Hello, Jacques. -Jacques. -[in French] Hello, Raoul. [in French] This is Jean Cottet. Lise and Raoul. -[in French] Hello. -[in French] Nice to meet you. [Jacques] Simone Cottet. Lise and Raoul. -[in French] Pleasure, ma'am. -[in French] Hello, sir.. [in French] You must be hungry. Can I get you anything? -[in French] Yes, thanks. -[in French] Splendid. Simone and Jean are wonderful. They are good friends and they will do anything for us. Ah, Jules. Jules, this is Lise. -[in French] Hello. -[in French] Hello. And Raoul. -[in French] Hello. -[in French] Hello, Jules. Jules is our courier here. [in French] No, thanks. I have found a safe house for Arnaud. Twelve kilometres, a little village called Faverges. Good. And a rendezvous at a house called the Limes. I'll take a look at it right away. Will you get me a map of this area? Number 74. -I've got two. -Where is Arnaud? I sent him to Toulouse. -Do you want me to go for him? -No, no, you stay here. Jacques, I'd like you to go for him. You know the territory. I may have to go back and report to Buck. -Will you see Roger now, sir? -Oh, yes, will you send him in, please? Will you come in? -Hello, Roger. Sit down. -[Roger] Thank you, sir. Now, listen, Roger. I've got an important job for you to do. I'm worried about the security of our circuit in the southeast. I've got an idea they've got trouble coming to them. Now, I want you to duplicate that circuit by another one. We've got to be stronger there for special reasons. -I understand, sir. -Do you? I'm sorry, sir. So I'm fixing for Raoul, who's head of that circuit now, to come to meet you at Tournay and he'll come back to London for a few days. Yes, sir. [both singing] [birds chirping] [Pierre] Empty as a barrel. [insects scurrying] -And perfect for a night landing. -Perfect. What a bit of luck. Let's find Arnaud. Odette, I'm on my way! Pierre, how long will you be away? I don't know. Two or three days, I expect. Buck has something important to discuss with me. When you get to London, will you telephone someone for me? What about security? Oh, I think that is all right. But anyway, you can decide. I want you to telephone a convent and give a message to three children there. What's the message? Will you tell them that… that their mother is very well and that she sends them her love? Say you are speaking from Scotland. How old are they? Oh… Francoise is nine and two months. Lily is just turned seven, and Marianne is five. -Nice kids? -Very sweet. I bet they are. Where's Papa? Oh, their parents have been separated for some time. Ah, that information was correct. Arnaud says Raoul has been to see the aerodrome and it is disused. Good. Let's have a look at that on the map. It's, er, 84. -Let's see, the moon's in the… -Second quarter, sir. Second quarter. -That'll be all right… -Here it is, sir. About ten kilometres from the town. Yes, that's it. Right, here's the message personnel for that operation. [in French] "Women are sometimes fickle." [relaxing piano music] What time is it? 7:24. Six minutes to go. You are on the right wavelength? Just next door. That's Carroll Gibbons. Oh, yes. [relaxing music continues] Do you like dancing, Odette? Very much. If we weren't doing this, we might be doing that. And how very much more pleasant. It's dangerous even to think of it. We must not think of anything except the job. How right you are. Pierre, what made you come to France? I just volunteered, like you. Volunteering is easy. It is what goes on in your heart before you volunteer. That is not so easy. Did you go through hell too? I went through hell. Hmm… I suppose we all do. In this racket, I mean. I say, we are letting down our hair a bit, aren't we? I think it is not a bad thing sometimes to let down our hair. Helps us to go on with this work. [knock on door] -[in French] Who's there? -Arnaud. -[in French] All right. -Listen, I've got some big news. -What news? -I got some very big news. The Vichy militia's rounding up the men to take them to forced labour battalions in Germany, you knew that? Yes, we knew that. When they knock at the door and ask "Where is Georges?", Georges is not there. -Where is Georges? -I don't know. It's your story. -You better tell me, make it snappy. -Well, listen to me. Please listen! Georges is with hundreds of others, young and old, living under the sky. They've organised themselves beautifully. They trained to fight like soldiers, ambush like guerrillas, to sabotage and they call themselves, you know what? [in French] The Maquis. -[in French] Ah, the maquisard? -Yes. -But they need arms badly. -Where are they? -On the plateau at Glières. -That's where Buck must drop the goods. -Arnaud, take a message to Buck at once. -Yes. -Ask for hand grenades, Sten guns. -Yes. K-rations, medical supplies, clams, limpets, pencils… It is getting near the time. -[radio jamming] -Blast! They're jamming us again. [woman in French] Here are a few personal messages. The cow jumped over the moon. I repeat, the cow jumped over the moon. Women are sometimes fickle. God old Buck, he's fixed it! Good old Buck! Arnaud, get that message off as soon as you can. [in French] Goodbye, old chap. -[in French] The five letters. -[in French] Thanks! Bye. Now then, Lise, Jules… you know what you have to do? I'll give her the cue sign if she comes in. When the pilot answers, I'll give you this, then you flash your torches for the flare path. -[plane engine droning] -There she is. Yes, there she is! Now, take up your stations. -Pierre, you'll not forget to telephone? -I won't forget. -[in French] See you soon. -[in French] Goodbye, Odette. [plane engine droning] There she is, Paul. [engine droning continues] She's seen us. -Now, Paul, you know your drill. -[in French] Yes. Take Roger to Paris, hand him over to his contact, then beat it straight back St. Jorioz. [in French] All right. She's made it. [plane engine slowing down] -Raoul? -Welcome, Roger. This is Paul. He'll take you to your contact in Paris. -[in French] Goodbye. -[in French] Goodbye. [plane engine revving] "Well done. Good work. "One maquisard prepare three large bonfires in straight line of wind and light these only at sound of squadron's approach." "Expect delivery of 126, repeat, 126 containers between midnight and 02:00 hours…" [water rustling] -[in French] My name's Lise. -[in French] Hello, I'm Georges. [in French] Hello, Georges. You have a message from London for Milo. -What about? -About the RAF. [in French] Okay. This is the message. You must memorise it. "One maquisard prepare three large bonfires at 100 metres intervals…" Hundred metres. "…in straight line of wind." "Light these bonfires only at sound of squadron's approach and expect delivery of 126 containers "between midnight and 02:00 hours from tomorrow night." Will you repeat that? "One maquisard prepares three large bonfires at 100 metres intervals in straight line of wind…" [soft engine droning] [in French] Light the fires! [plane engine drones softly] [strong suspenseful music] [plane engines drone loudly] [suspenseful music intensifies] [suspenseful music fades] [tranquil piano music] [piano music intensifies] What a pity Herr Hitler does not like Mendelssohn. It was always my ambition to be a concert pianist. You play very well. A great concert pianist. [stormy piano music] [stormy piano music fades] But I suppose… being a Colonel in the Abwehr… [calm piano music] has its compensations. What answer is the Colonel going to give to General Keitel about the liquidation of General Giraud? [music fades] It's about time General Keitel told Corporal Hitler that military intelligence is not a murder organisation. We leave that to the Gestapo. I hate war. Interrupts my music. [calm piano music] It may interest you to know a few days ago in a café in the Champs Élysées, I arrested Paul. Did you get anything out of him? If I hadn't, my dear Jules, why do you think I should be in Annecy today? [calm piano music continues] Do you know anything about a man who goes by the name of Roger? I understand he has a most important assignment. He will contact a young lady called Lise. Twenty nine. Brunette. -Most attractive. -[music fades] [in French] Excuse me, madame. Are you Madame Métayer? [in French] Yes. Please… this is Roger. [in French] Hello, Roger. Why are you not in Paris? Well, Paul got picked up last Tuesday, so I got out of Paris as quickly as I could. -[car hoots] -Where are you staying? I haven't fixed anything yet. It's not safe for you to be here. Jacques, take Roger to the Hôtel de la Plage. That is a safe house. And I will get word to Raoul about Paul. -[in French] Goodbye. -[in French] Goodbye. -[in French] Goodbye, ma'am. -[in French] Goodbye. [car engine chugging] [relaxing piano music] [relaxing music continues] Mademoiselle Lise? -You are mistaken, monsieur. -I think not. -I am Madame Métayer. -Maybe. But I prefer to call you Lise. May I sit down? I'm an officer in the German Army. In France, mademoiselle, I go by the name of Henri. I fail to see, monsieur, what you can want with me. Oh, I have a letter for you. From your friend Paul, who is now is Fresnes prison in Paris for his own safety. Please read it. This letter is not addressed to me, monsieur. It is for you or for Raoul. Who is at present in London with Colonel Buckmaster. Yes, forgive me, but I know all about your Colonel Buckmaster. It's my job. Indeed, you know more than I do, monsieur. Let me explain myself. I am a member of the German military Abwehr, which, as you probably know, is roughly equivalent to your MI5. Personally, I hold no allegiance to the Nazi Party. This is a very great gulf between the German High Command and Hitler and his satellites. Now, if you were to act as intermediary between people who think as I do and London, that would not be an unimportant role for a young lady of your wit and intelligence. -You flatter me, monsieur. -Not at all. Now, I want you to give me a radio transmission set and a code, with which I can get into touch with Colonel Buckmaster. [chuckles] Do you expect me to believe this fantastic story? If you're as intelligent as I think you are, I do. If my conversations with Buckmaster are successful, and I have every reason to think they will be, I shall then ask you to fly me to London so that I can lay my further plans before your War Office. Do please read it. You tell me Paul is in prison. He may have written this under pressure. Why not send a courier to Fresnes to see him? I guarantee safe conduct. Paul has been arrested. I want you to go to Fresnes prison and see him. Here is a note from Colonel Henri of the Abwehr. This will ensure you safe conduct. And when I see Paul? I want you to find out if he wrote this letter without pressure. Make it clear that you must see Paul alone. That is very important. -[in French] Very well. -And take him this parcel of food. And I report to the Limes when I come back? No, come straight back to me. I shall be here. -[in French] Goodbye, Jules. -[in French] Goodbye. -[in French] Good luck. -[in French] Thank you. Arnaud, something quite extraordinary has happened. What? We must get a full report through to London. Sounds pretty bad, sir. Just about as unpleasant as it possibly could be. I'm sending Raoul back. Look, have that coded and sent out, please. Yes, sir. [knock on door] [in French] Come in. [in French] How are you, Jules? It is all true. Paul says so. Henri is to be completely trusted. And you are to do everything he asks. I see. Thank you, Jules. I must think about this. Will you come back and see me later tonight? [in French] Fine. When is Raoul returning? I do not know. Is Roger still in Paris? I do not know, but I think he is in Paris. You are not well, Jules? [in French] I'm so tired. I will give you a cachet. -[in French] Thank you. -[in French] Goodbye, Jules. [in French] Goodbye. [door shuts] Jacques, I am afraid things are not good. I want you to go to Roger. Tell him to get right away from here immediately. -The house of Mr. Gliese is very safe. -[in French] All right. And then I want you to go to Annecy station. Robert and Jean are on the evening train from Paris. Stop them from coming to St Jorioz, and give them this money. -And what about the Limes? -Go there. Tell them to disperse. And then I want you to come and meet me at the patisserie at Faverges. I'm going to Arnaud to get a message through to Buck. -[in French] Goodbye. -[in French] Goodbye. -[in French] Go on, it's your turn. -[in French] Don't rush me. -[in French] You always take half an hour! -[in French] There, I've played. -[in French] And now you're drinking. -[bell ringing] [in French] Give me a moment. There! [in French] Very good. That's exquisite. Splendid. -[in French] I had no choice. -[in French] Maybe not. [in French] There! Now you can drink! [in French] Don't bother. Set them up again. [in French] Ah, Lise, good evening. How are you? Buck has replied. Arnaud, where is your map? Here it is. -Raoul must come back at once. -Why, what's happened? Jules. He is working for Henri. -How do you know? -He asked me, "Where is Roger?" I'm certain he wanted to know that for Henri. Where is Roger now? I have already sent him away to Monsieur Gliese. So Jules is a goddamn snake, eh? Where is he? I do not know, but I do know that he has uncomfortable pains in his stomach. I gave him one of Buck's pills. I'd like to give him one of my pills. Arnaud, will you get a message off to Buck? There is only one place Raoul can land near here. -That is the Semnoz plateau. -What's the number? Seventy four. Seventy four.… Annecy… P14. [sweet string music] Lise… to think that, in peace time, tourists used to come up here for pleasure! Arnaud, this is perfect! Yes, it's very good. A bonfire could never be seen here from the valley. No, no, no. It's very good, very good. [wind blows] Well, Lise has certainly taken you at your word. I mean, about being prepared to jump anywhere. -[Pierre] Why? -Well, look at it. That's Arnaud's map reference there, on the Semnoz. Nearly 6,000 feet up, right on top of an Alp. Blimey, I hope I don't hit a mountain goat. No. They've got such sharp horns. [plane engines revving] [water rustling] Come on, Arnaud! We shall be late. It took us three hours to get up there yesterday. -Tonight we've got four. -Yesterday it was daylight. [plane engine droning] -Lise, are you hurt? -No, I do not think so. -Come on. -Please, you must help me. Oh… Listen. Listen! [plane engine droning] Arnaud! Arnaud, there he is! Yes, it's him. Come on. You must help me! Oh, shut up! Come on, then! Here, quick! Quick! [droning intensifies] Come on! We've nearly made it. Oh, shut up! Come on. No bonfire! They're sure to be here. -Ask him to circle round again. -Okay. Skipper, go round again, will you? [engine drones loudly] -Nothing doing? -No, nothing at all. [engine droning continues] Bonfire's ahead! Stand by to jump! Jump! Okay, skipper, that was bang on. [soft thud] [Odette] Pierre! [in French] My little Odette. Oh, Pierre! I was so afraid. I thought you would not be here in time. I was beginning to think you'd had it. Oh, Pierre! Did you telephone to my children? Yes, I did. They're going on fine. I put on a Scotch accent and pretended I'd met you in Aberdeen. Oh, Pierre! Welcome back! Welcome back! A nice ruddy mess we're in here, eh? I know. We've got to clear out. We are safe for two days. I told Henri that London must have until the 18th to fix the operation with the RAF and he believed me completely. Dare not risk it. We have to clear out as soon as we've had some sleep. Arnaud, meet us at six o'clock in the morning at the hotel. We'll cross the lake and stay with the Maquis. Oh! I've got to sleep with a lot of ruddy mountains! [bell tolls] [car engine droning] -[tires screeching] -[doors slamming] [birds chirping] [knock on door] [louder knocking] [in French] Who's there? A courier from Paris wants to speak to you urgently. You've played the game with great skill, Lise. I congratulate you. But now you're under arrest. Take me to Raoul. Escape's quite impossible. The hotel's surrounded, if you make any noise, I've given orders to shoot. [in German] He's upstairs. Let's go. -Keep your arms where they are. -It's no use, Pierre. The hotel is surrounded. What is your name? Pierre Chambrun. Not Pierre Chauvet? Or Raoul? British agent and saboteur? Come on. Get dressed. How the devil can I get dressed? [car doors slam] This area, as you know, is occupied by our allies, the Italians. Would you prefer to be prisoners of the Germans or the Italians? The Italians, chum. Wouldn't you? Annecy barracks. Now, don't forget, Arnaud, when you get to Perpignan, it's Madame Chasse, 32 avenue Klébert. Anyone will tell you where it is. What is it? A tiny sort of grain shop, run by a scruffy-looking woman about 50. When you get in, you say, [in French] "Hello ma'am. I'm just passing by." [in French] "I'm just passing by." -That's all? -That's all. She'll understand straight away, and you're practically halfway across the Pyrenees. All right? [in French] Goodbye, Arnaud. Don't forget to tell Buck that I'm running very short of money. Huh! Your friend Pierre Chambrun broke out of his cell last night in an attempt to escape. He was stopped by the sentries and resisted them. In consequence, he was badly beaten. I am sorry. And I am sorry for you. You should be more careful. You see, his real name is Peter Churchill and he is a relation of the Prime Minister of England. A relative of Winston Churchill? Yes. And my name is not Madame Métayer. I am Mrs Peter Churchill, his wife. [in Italian] My God! -[in Italian] Bring prisoner 11 here. -[in Italian] Yes, sir. [phone ringing] [in Italian] Yes? It has been agreed by your Chief of Staff that the two prisoners are to be transferred to our custody. Right. You'll put them on the train at Annecy. And then hand them over to the escort that will be waiting at Toulon. Those are my orders. Is that clear? Well, see that they arrive in good health. Is it true that your name is not Pierre Chambrun, but that your name is--? You're nuts! No, your name is not nuts. Your name is Churchill and you are a relation of Winston Churchill. Oh, yes. She has told me. And she is not Madame Métayer. She is your wife. Now, Jules. I want you to find out where Arnaud has got to. And also whether Roger was able to contact Lise. That is imperative. -Understand? -[in French] Very well. I'm leaving now for Paris to welcome our guests. [dramatic music playing] [in German] Come on, move it! [music becomes slow] [music stops] [in German] I'd like to get my hands on her! As for him… Thank you, I do not smoke. I am truly sorry to see you in this place, Lise. Fresnes is not for people like you. But I arrested you to save you from the Gestapo. You arrested Paul, no doubt, for the same motive. That is by the way. There is no need for you to stay here now… …if you care to help me. In what way? Apart from providing you with a transmitting set. Oh, my dear Lise, you would help me if you… chose to tell me how I could contact your friends Arnaud and Roger. I have nothing to say. Do you care for music? Why do you ask? There's a Mozart concert tomorrow night salle Pleyel. I've discovered an admirable little restaurant, best wine and food in Paris. I impose no conditions. But I do. Pity. Lise. I don't want you to go to the Gestapo. Enjoy your concert, Henri. I've got some bad news for you. Arnaud's been arrested. Together with the rest of your circuit. You must be due for promotion, Henri. It's not improbable. Now, why did you tell me that you'd only given Arnaud 30,000 francs? Because I did, the night I landed. My dear Raoul. That's a lie. When I arrested Arnaud, he had 400,000 francs on him. Really? Then the old boy must have been to the casino. How would you… like the idea… of my suggesting to London… through some neutral source… that we exchange you for… Rudolf Hess? A good idea. After all, you are a relation of Winston Churchill's. Oh, yes, but… the old man has a great sense of values, you know, and I think he'd rather keep Hess. Pity. Believe me… what I said to Lise at Annecy was not all nonsense. I do hate the Nazis. If you and I could find a way of going together to London, and establishing contact between the High Command and the War Office, we might find a way of putting an end to this misery. -Oh… I don't think so. -Isn't it worth trying? Yes, but… I'm tired, Henri. You try. [prisoners chatting] ♪ Where are you? Where are you? ♪ ♪ Ladeetee, where are you? ♪ [Pierre singing outside] ♪ Where are you? Where are you? Ladeetee! Where are you? ♪ Pierre! Oh, Pierre! [glass breaks] Pierre! Odette! Pierre! [Pierre] Odette! [loud chatter] How are you doing? I am all right! [banging on the door] I'm Father Paul. There's little I can do to comfort you while you're here, but whatever's possible, I will do. Thank you, Father. Will this help you a little? Tribunal! Tribunal! -[loud bang] -What does that mean? That you go now to the Gestapo headquarters for interrogation. God bless you, my child. And give you strength. [door bangs shut] [children playing outside] Won't you? Allow me. Why do you call yourself Frau Churchill? Because I am married to Peter Churchill. Your commanding officer and the brains of your circuit? Peter would be flattered to hear you say that. He was not the head of the circuit. I was. It was I who persuaded him to come to France. What he did here, and it was very little, he did under my influence. Is that so? Peter is not a saboteur. He's really a playboy. His favourite pastime is ice hockey. In 1932, he played for England at Berlin. Did he really? Well, thank you. It's wise of you to be so cooperative. Have a cigarette? -I do not smoke. -Do you mind if I do? Now, I want you to give me the answers to three simple questions. Where did you send the plans for the port of Marseille? Did you send them to England? -I have nothing to say. -Oh. And I would like to know the whereabouts of a man called Arnaud and an Englishman called Roger. Where did they go? I have nothing to say. We have ways and means of making you talk. I have nothing to say. Pity. [door clicks open] I have told you, we have ways and means to make a woman talk. Do not touch me! [loud slap] Undo that blouse! Will you answer my questions? I have nothing to say. Will you answer my questions? I have nothing to say. [she moans] [malicious chuckle] I complimented the Gustav on the excellence of the tea. And do you know what he told me? The British obligingly dropped it in containers for the French partisans! -[everybody chuckles] -Well? I cannot get anything out of her. What have you tried? I have tried a red-hot poker to her spine and I had all her toenails pulled out. And you got nothing? All I can get after each evulsion is, "I have nothing to say." And that is all. I'll come myself. Perhaps the psychological approach will be better. [door closes] [wheezing] You are not being courageous. You are being stupid. I have nothing to say. We shall find Arnaud and Roger. But you can save us time and trouble. I have nothing to say. Then save yourself this. I have nothing to say. [in German] Shall we continue? [in German] There's no point. Let her go. Get out. I have nothing to say. Get out! I have nothing to say. I have nothing… [sighs] [in German] Open up! [door closes] My child. What have they done to you? [in German] Oh Lord, forgive them. Father. If you… If you see Captain Peter Churchill… in the men's division… do not tell him… what the Gestapo did. He will not hear of it from me. I am afraid if he knows… he will do something rash. And then… they will hurt him. I understand. Is there nothing I can do to help you? Would it be possible… to say mass? I would gladly do so, my child. But my duties here are to comfort the dying and to bury the dead. I will ask, but I am sure the Gestapo will not permit me. Why? Are they so afraid of God? -[man] Good morning, sir. -[Arnaud] Morning. -Where to, sir? -Orchard Court, Baker Street. [man] Thank you, sir. Orchard Court, Baker Street. -But I want to go back! -[Maurice] Well, you can't go back. -What news of Raoul and Lise? -Not a word. They must be still in jail. Unless they've been shot. Why can't I go back to France? I want the chance… Never once have I used this gun. Do you mind putting that away, Arnaud? We don't like firearms. You don't like firearms? Look. Arnaud, I'm going to send you on a course up to Scotland. We've got a new transmission set I'd like you to try out. And that, Arnaud, is an order. And then you promise me to drop me back in France? Yes. That I promise. Okay. Can I have a bath in this black bath? Of course. Would you like to borrow one of my detective stories? [in German] I suggest the death penalty, gentlemen. [in German] Anything less would be stupid and sentimental. [in German] My opinion entirely. [in German] Those who agree with me, please raise your hands. [in German] Thank you. [in German] Major. I have nothing to say. I have nothing to say. [in German] Mrs. Churchill. [he is speaking German] I do not understand German. Very well. "Frau Churchill, you are condemned to die." "You are a Frenchwoman and a British agent." "On these two counts, you are condemned to death." You must make your own choice. I can only die once. [in German] Guard. [melancholic music playing] [in German] Death is too good for her. If it was up to me… -[in German] Shut up! -[in German] I didn't say anything. [in German] Open the door. [in German] Now go. [music abruptly stops] Will you believe me when I say how sorry, how utterly ashamed I am? What they have done to you had nothing to do with me. I could not prevent it. That I do believe. I have now come to tell you that… tomorrow you must go to police headquarters to have your fingerprints taken. Why? I am not a criminal. Why do they not take them after I am dead? It would be so much easier. It is the orders of the Gestapo before you… before you go to Germany. Lise, it's the Gestapo. It is not my fault! I am not responsible. Do not keep saying that, Henri. Whatever you say, however much you try to hide behind other people, you cannot get away from the truth. You are party to the horrors of this war as much as any other Nazi. Therefore, it is your fault and your responsibility. Do not say again, "I am not responsible." I… I have nothing to say. Is there anything I can do for you? Yes, Henri, there is something. Will my husband be at the police headquarters tomorrow? I believe so. Will you arrange that he will be there at the same time as I am? I… I would like to say goodbye to him. I will see that it is arranged. And you will not tell him that I have been condemned to death. He will never hear it from me. Oh, and, Henri… Would you be so kind as to have this dirty blouse washed for me? [chattering] [in German] Quiet! Quiet! Wonderful to see you. I was wondering all night if you'd be here. -How are they treating you? -Not bad. -And you? -Not bad. -Were you interrogated? -Yes. And you? -Did they hurt you? -No. Can't think why. I've been terrified they'd do something dreadful to you. -I wonder if Arnaud managed to get away? -Yes. I heard through the grapevine in the exercise yard, he got back to London. Oh, but poor Arnaud. He will hate that. He'll get back somehow. Don't you worry. Oh, it was so good when I could hear you sing! It was wonderful to find out where you were. What happened about the broken window? -Two days without soup. -Bad luck. Oh, it was worth it. Why are you walking on your heels? Oh, it is nothing. Just that I walk so much round my cell that I get blisters on my feet. Odette… we'll meet again, won't we? After all this is over. Yes, Pierre. We shall meet somewhere. [melancholic music playing] [in German] Quiet! [in German] Mrs. Churchill! [in German] The Kommandant. You are to come with us. [man in German] A train from Fürstenberg is to be expected. [man in German] Ensure the prisoners are collected from the station. [in German] Have you understood? Good. [in German] Mrs. Churchill, Herr Kommandant. [in German] Ms. Marguarite, please. [in German] Do you speak German? I do not understand German. You are Frau Churchill? Yes. Here in Ravensbrück, you will not be Frau Churchill. You will be known as Frau Schurer. You will be put in the camp prison, in solitary confinement, until your sentence of death has been carried out. [in German] Frau Schurer is to have no favours. [in German] No walks, no baths, no light. Take her away. The British are so lazy. They speak only English. I have heard Winston Churchill speaks 15 languages, Herr Kommandant. Ach! He can't even say "Nazi". Naaaahzi. When we get him, Otto, no privileges. No cognac. No cigars. [both chuckle] Frau Schurer, no privileges for you. No exercise, no bath, and no light. Peter Churchill. Alias Pierre Chambrun. Alias Raoul. The evidence from this man's wife. Thank you. It seems that you came to France at your wife's instigation, but that you were very bad at your job. What? You are, in fact, a playboy who thought playing at being a spy was rather fun. Well, let me assure you, Peter Churchill, that spying is a serious business. It's more serious than ice hockey or knocking policemen's helmets off at Oxford. -Cambridge, if you don't mind. -What? -I said Cambridge. -What does it matter, Oxford, Cambridge? Oh, but it does, you know. Inform Sachsenhausen they have a new guest. Rather an important one. He is a relation of Winston Churchill. Have them prepare a room for him. Yes, of course, and a bath! Peter Churchill, from these reports, we do not propose to waste any more time over you. You will be sent to a special camp for people of your kind and remain there till England is defeated. Oh, a life sentence. What? Oh! [in German] Guards! Take him away. [echoes of gunfire] Herr Kommandant. [in German] Frau Schurer is to go a week without food. [in German] Her heating must be turned right up. -[in German] Orders from the Gestapo. -[in German] Very well, Herr Kommandant. [grunts] [Marguarite] Frau Schurer. The Allies have landed in the south of France. The plans you stole of Marseille docks no doubt have been of assistance to them. [Odette] Why do you tell me this? Because, by order of the Gestapo, you get no food for a week. What are you doing? The Gestapo also ordered a little heat. So to make you more comfortable. [door slams] [string music playing] Otto. Last night I had a bad dream. [in German] Yes, Herr Kommandant? Have you ever thought what would happen to us if Germany… lost the war? No, Herr Kommandant. Germany cannot lose the war. It was not a pleasant dream. Frau Schurer, Herr Kommandant. -You have not let her die? -No, but she has collapsed. With no food for a week and the heat full on, this morning I found her unconscious. -What did you do? -I gave her an injection. -And she recovered her senses? -Yes. Good. Things must be changed. -You must be more careful, Margaret. -Herr Kommandant! Move her to a cell on the ground floor and give her food. -But Herr Kommandant… -[in German] Quickly! [in German] Very well, Herr Kommandant. [string music continues] [echoes of gunfire] [string music continues] [music fades] [in German] Yes. [in German] Yes, Herr Reichsführer. Heil Hitler. [gunfire] [in German] Ms. Marguarite Reinachicken, please. Cigarette. All prisoners to be executed immediately. Order from Reichsführer Himmler personally. -No witnesses, huh? -No witnesses. [Marguarite] You sent for me, Herr Kommandant? Yes. -Take good care of Frau Churchill. -Frau Churchill, Herr Kommandant? -I said Frau Churchill! -[in German] Very well, Herr Kommandant. You are responsible. No harm must come to her. [in German] Very well, Herr Kommandant. [chattering] We have only to wait. Though God knows we have waited long enough. Why did they not shoot me with the others? [loud echoes of bombs] The Americans and the Russians come! [hubbub] -[telephone ringing] -Otto, telephone! [Otto in German] Hello? Yes, straight away. -[Otto] Herr Kommandant? -[in German] Yes? -[in German] For you. -[in German] Thank you. Hello? [in German] I beg your pardon? [in German] What did you say? [in German] Quiet! [in German] I beg your pardon? [in German] No! [in German] Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the German Reich, is dead. [in German] The war is over. Hitler is dead. The Führer is dead. [chaos] -[in German] Stop! Don't move! -[gunshot] -[in German] Stop! Don't move! -[gunshot] Frau Churchill! The Americans and the Russians are here. What shall I do, Frau Churchill? You forget my name is Frau Schurer. No, no, you are Frau Churchill. You must help me. I… I am not to blame. I have only carried out my orders. It is always someone else who is to blame! But, Frau Churchill, I have three children! You must help me! You must help me! I understand how you feel. -I too have three children. -[Marguarite weeps] Frau Churchill. Come. At once. [she keeps on sobbing] [guard] It will not be necessary for you to bring anything. -[in German] Fire! -[gunshot] [sobbing continues] I think the Americans will arrive too late for me. Frau Churchill, what shall I do? Have you forgotten how to pray? [hubbub] Otto. -[in German] Have Frau Churchill get in. -[in German] Very well, Herr Kommandant. Do you know where I take you? I do not know and I do not care. I am saving your life, Frau Churchill. I take you to the Americans. What did you say? I take you to the Americans. Hey, Stan, hit that light! Pick up that car and hold it. Here is Frau Churchill. She was a prisoner at Ravensbrück. She is a relative of Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of England. -You must be responsible for her. -Who the hell do you think you are? He's the Kommandant of Ravensbrück concentration camp. Make him your prisoner. Yeah? All right, guys, take care of them. Now, how about you, lady? What are you doing here? I am a British agent, a member of the French section of Special Forces. My number is S23. I have been a prisoner at Ravensbrück. -And that guy really is the Kommandant? -Yes, yes. He's one of the guys we're after. [explosion] We'll have to check up on you, ma'am. Yes, I quite understand, but, I want to get a message through to my commanding officer in London. Okay. Looks to me like what you need right now is a stiff shot of cognac and a nice juicy steak. -Come along. -I could not eat. -I must get a message to London! -Okay! Who is your commanding officer? Major Buckmaster, of the French section of the War Office. [Odette coughs] You think my children will know me like this? Well, I think you'll find they've changed a lot too. [phone ringing] Hello. Oh, yes. Just a moment. Odette. [Odette] Francoise? This is Mummy. Yes, darling, Mummy. Oh, you sound so grownup. I suppose you'll get down to some serious work now? -Yes, sir. -Peter! Buck! Odette's in there. [Odette] It is a long time, but I am coming to see you this afternoon, darling. Yes, I am coming to see you all this very afternoon. What is that? Oh… oh, yes. Yes, I had quite a nice time in Scotland. Goodbye, my darling. [phone clicks] [Odette sobbing] Odette. [sentimental music] [sentimental music intensifies] [music fades]
