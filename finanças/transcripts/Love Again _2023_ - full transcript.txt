Love your smell. - I brought you something. - What'd you get me? - What'd I get you? - Hm? What'd I get you? - Boom! - [Gasps] - My favorite! Oh! - Mm-hm. Why eat regular when you can go tropical? - Yeah, tropical. - Mm-hm! All right, what you got? - What you been drawing? - Mm! - Oh! - Not yet. Is bhoomi finally ready to become a butterfly? - No. - Uh-huh. She's perfectly fine just as she is. - Stop trying to change her. - All right. So roxy's tonight? - Or I was thinking... - Mm-hm? How about we stay in and I can cook? - No, thanks. - What do you mean? Baby, come on, you think I'll let you back in the kitchen after last time? Wait a minute, that was your mom's branzino recipe. - Your favorite. - I don't know what that was. Never cooking for you again. Thank you. [Both laugh] I got to go. - Why? - Gotta go. - I got a meeting. - Don't go. Babe, you know I'll be thinking about you. I wanna show you something. [John] Oh. [Mira] I knew you were here the whole time. Twist ending. How? Well, I could feel you. Also, I could see you in that reflection with my eyes. - [Laughs] - Damn, I look good! [Mira] Oh, that's just an artist's touch. - You're a lucky lady. - I am. I'll see you later? - Love you so much. - Love you. - Bye. - Bye.

[Sirens wailing] [Music fades] [Poignant music playing] [Answering machine beeps] [Woman on recording] Hey, it's your sister, doing my daily check-in. How's it going today? How's mom and dad? Wanna give me a call and catch up? [Mira sighs] - Ma? - [Answering machine beeps] [On recording] Suzy again. You know what? You didn't call me back, but that's fine. Papa? What do you do with mom and dad at night there? I'm just curious. Do you guys hang out and watch British bake off? [Answering machine beeps] [Suzy on recording] I know you're still grieving, but I just wanted to say I really miss you. [Poignant music continues] [Answering machine beeps] [On recording] Hey, it's Suzy again. Like the new drawings. Little dark, though. Don't you think? Maybe you should come back to the city, to your room, which is empty, in our apartment? [Mira sighs] [Answering machine beeps] [Suzy on recording] Mira, enough. You know I'm not great with words, but John loved you. And I'm sure he would not wanna see you stuck like this. [Mira sighs] [Answering machine beeps] Mom and dad want their house back! Do I have to come and get you? [Hopeful music playing] - Bye, papa. - Bye, beta. - Drive safely. - I will. Bye, mom. [Mom speaks in hindi] - Okay. I got it. Bye. - [Mom in English] Bye. - [Papa] Bye. - [Mom] Bye. - See you, mom. - [Mom] Bye. [Papa] Tell Suzy she needs to text her parents back. I will. [Hopeful music continues] She's here!

How do you know that? - Instagram. I should be starting the podcast for the newspaper. No, what you should be doing is leaving my office to go work on céline Dion. Now, you seem to forget, Rob, that I've taken a big chance hiring you, fellow brit. But ever since you were publicly humiliated by that woman... Elizabeth. Ever since Elizabeth dropped you like a stone just days before your wedding, well, your work has lacked heart. Huh. [Scoffs] Céline Dion is all about heart. Okay? People adore her. I adore her. So get onboard, or I'll find someone who will. - [Mira] S-a-d, sad. - [Suzy] Are you joking? Shut up. It was the only one I could find. [Laughs] [Cell phone chimes] It's just five. I'm gonna lose this game. Aw! Bernard wrote back. Bernard's back in the picture, huh? Mm... not quite sure. But he wrote, "see you soon, dot, dot, dot." With a winky smiley. Means he wants to see me. I don't know about that. Sounds like a blow-off to me. What? No. Winky smiley. That's, like, way more... [purrs]... like, meaningful than, like, a regular smiley. You know what's crazy, Suzy? Our parents worked their asses off to send us to college, and here we are, decoding the winky in a smiley. Here you are, ladies. Two miras, medium rare. Wait, what is a Mira? When they put the fries inside the burger. - [Mo chuckles] - Mo, you named a burger after me? Of course. I name burgers after all my favorite customers. It's good to see you. God, I missed you around here. - You, not so much. - [Suzy chuckles] How you holding up? - You know. - [Mo] Yeah. Takes a long time. Yeah. I still have a ways to go, I think. Well, you know, there's no clock. God knows, I... I still miss roxy every day. How do you deal with it, mo? Pour a glass of wine, sit down for dinner, and tell her about my day.

I don't wanna deal with another phone. I took the phone! Take the phone. It's not a choice. And you? Duh. - Fine, fine. - Yeah. Uh, be careful. There's a rumor Hughes is tracking everything we say and do on that. - What? - [Billy] Hey. When are you going to text Jessica? I told her you would.

Yeah, she's right. You know, just let me set you up. - You're not even on the apps anymore. - Love isn't real. It... It's just a bunch of pheromones that wear off.

We make children's books here. Children. Remember them? Little people who like to look at bright pictures and laugh. Well, maybe it's better to prepare them. That life will inevitably crush their hopes and dreams. They tell us not to pressure creatives. But after two years, I think I'm allowed to put a little on you. Molly, could you come in here, please? Yes, Ms. Valentine? Mira, this is Molly. - Hi. - Big fan. Molly's a paid intern from nyu. Scholarship kid. Raised by a single mom. That's amazing.

"We should be together." Oh, my god. Gross. Rob, you could be, like, my dad. I'm, like, 35. [Whispers] I'm 35. - Ugh. - Not much older than you are. I'm pretty cool. Yeah, whatever. I just thought... - You didn't send me a text? - What text? [Lisa groans] No way. I don't flirt like that. I'm, like, good at it. I think they're nice. Oh! Whoa, that's super sad. Who is sending me these texts? Someone's smishing you. Phishing, but by text. First, they lure you in, then they ask for your credit card number. - Delete it. - Yeah. [Poignant music playing] Céline, you're arguably more popular today than when you started. How do you think you've managed to stay relevant for so long? Hm. What a question. Do you ever stop and ask yourself why people continue to read your work as a middle-aged male journalist? Maybe it's because if the work is good, it's timeless. Yeah? Miss Dion, it's been over a decade since you've toured in the states. I'm curious. Why now? For five years, it's been tough. Raising my children after the loss of their father, the love of my life, my husband, réne. - [Cell phone chimes] - And at the same time, I didn't want to just sit around and be sad. So I decided to hit the road and do what I love. Tell me about it. What was that? Nothing. Just... I was responding to a text. - Sorry. - Oh. Cool. Feel free to talk with friends if I'm boring you. No, no, no, it wasn't... I mean... I wouldn't say it was a friend. [Cell phone chimes] [Rob clears throat] Do you have a question for me? Um... Yes. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Um... Miss Dion... Céline, you sing a lot about love, obviously. For example, in "that's the way it is," you say: "When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt, don't give up on your faith, love comes to those that believe it." But in "when I fall in love," you say, "in a restless world like this, love is ended... Before it's begun." What's the question? Well, do you really believe in all these things you sing? You obviously know nothing about it. What? Love. [Journalists chuckle] [Man] Céline, are you taking your children on tour with you? [Machine guns firing on TV] [Gentle music playing] Who are you texting? No one. This the same "no one" that you were texting last night? Yes, actually. But trust me, it's totally not what you think. Mira, there is nothing wrong with putting yourself back out there again. Oh, my god, stop, please, I wouldn't even know where to start. Oh, oh, oh! Well, it's kind of amazing that you say that because your sister, who loves you, who's kind of awesome and got your back, might have already started you on an app. Sorry, what? - I hate apps! - I know. I know. They're the worst. But... You're kind of beautiful, and young, and you have your whole life ahead of you. You're not allowed to give up on dating. So just take a look. What? No, no. I'm not ready for this. Okay, why is every guy shirtless? I wouldn't talk to any one of these guys. But you don't have to worry because it's bumble. So the woman makes the first move. What? What do you think? No? What about this guy? Okay. So we do a little right swipe. - I didn't tell you to swipe. - Wait. Stop. It's a match on your first one. Who even are you? - [Clicks tongue] - Oh. Come on, that is such a sign. So we just do a little "hey" - to see what he... - Don't text him. - Stop. - You texted him? Yes. Oh, my god, he's texting back. "Nice pic." Mm. - "Do you wanna go for a drink?" - No. - Yes. It's amazing! - No. Look, just do it for me, your sister, who loves you so, so, so much. - Your happiness is my happiness. - Shut up. - One drink. - You're gonna go? - If you shut up. - I promise. - One drink.

[Exhales] [Poignant music playing] I feel like I got to know her through these texts. You know, maybe I'm just fooling myself. These texts you're receiving are saying something. Things like this don't just happen. You need to pursue this. Really? You don't think it's crazy to fall for someone like this? Oh, it might be crazy. But love doesn't always follow the rules. Take my situation, for example. René had always been my manager my entire career. But I never thought of him in that way... Until one night in Dublin. What happened in Dublin? We were there for the eurovision song contest, and it was the night before finals. I was about to go up to my hotel room and get a good night's sleep. And rené wished me good night and gave me a kiss on each cheek, like he always did. But on that night, he stopped ever so briefly at my lips... And gave me the softest, sweetest little peck. And at that moment... That kiss on the lips was the answer to everything that I was feeling deep down inside of me. It was as if that kiss had unlocked a secret that had been in our hearts. [Tender music playing] I was his. And he was mine. Love has a plan for each and every one of us. I think these texts are part of the plan for you. [Door opens] Time's up. Oh. Um... We didn't get to the interview. Come back to me as a man and we can try again. - Yeah, I'm 35. - [Céline] Then you still have time. Love takes courage.

Because you don't even know if this is from her. Okay? Okay, it's from her. Just wait there. [Panting and mumbling] This makes no sense. "Here, where never is heard a discouraging word, is nothing but joy and desire." [Lisa] It's from orpheus and eurydice. The opera? By gluck? It's playing at the Manhattan opera house. - Sorry. You listen to "opera" now? - You don't know my life. Enlighten me, please. Orpheus travels to Hades to get back his dead wife. And he's given permission to return to earth with her, under the condition that he not look at her face until they're outta Hades. - Why? - I don't know. 'Cause the gods are dicks. Anyway, orpheus can't resist but look at eurydice's face because people are weak and love makes fools out of everyone. So he ends up losing her. All over again. I'm gonna go see it. - [Billy] Why? - Obviously, it has meaning for her. [Billy] Oh, okay. Uh... How do you know if she's even going? [Lisa] And if she does, you still won't know when. I'll just keep going until she shows up. Oh-ho. You'll just keep going? That is... that is so crazy. Yeah. Yeah, but like she said... Love makes fools of everyone.

I love a crisp winter's day in New York City. Um... yeah. I love the weather. - It's been very weather-y? - [Mouthing] Hey, I was wondering, do you eat? He just asked me if I eat. I mean, I know you eat. At least, I assume you do. But some people, they're just not into food. They do it because they have to. Otherwise, they would die. But I... I love food. I can't get enough. Unless, of course, I'm full. And then I'm like, "no, I'm all set here." [Mouthing] Yeah, so, specifically, I was wondering, would you like to eat? With me? [Mouthing] Tonight. Uh... yeah. I mean, I love food too. [Clears throat] Do you like cheeseburgers? Are you kidding? Cheeseburgers. I love cheeseburgers. Um, I know this cute little spot called roxy's. Um... Do you want to meet there, say, like, 7 tonight? Yeah. That's perfect. That's 7, that's my favorite time to meet. - Okay. - Well, I'll see you. Well, see ya. Wow, I have no words. [Both laughing] Oh, my god. Congratulations. You just got yourself a date the normal way. No apps. We're meeting for cheeseburgers at 7:00. That's in, like, 45 minutes. Perfect. Now you can tell her about the texts in person. But if I do that, she'll never speak to me again. - The truth hurts. - [Hughes] Rob. May I see you in my office, please? Actually, sir, I'm kinda busy. Rhetorical question. Now! How is the céline Dion piece coming along? Good. Really good. Anything for me to read? Uh, not yet, but soon. Okay, well, that's funny because I've been noticing quite a few interesting texts on your work phone. What? I don't even know where to begin. "My heart is broken. There's also this aching inside of me." Doesn't sound very work-related to me. Those are, um... Song lyrics. From céline Dion. Wow. Sounds like you've made a connection, if she's sending you lyrics. Yeah. [Hughes chuckles] Wow! - I'm holding céline's lyrics in my hand. - Yeah, you are. You know, my wife and I danced to "have you ever been in love" at our wedding. That's a deep cut, sir. I did not know that.

We were very much in love, and he bought a ring and died before he could propose. I'm sorry. I was engaged once. Oh, really. What happened? I don't know. She decided she didn't want to go through with it. The week before the wedding. - Jeez. - The worst part of it was... Being left with all these questions. To be honest, I may have gone crazy trying to figure out what went wrong. Well, did you figure it out? Love is a mystery. And in a restless world like this one... It can be ended... Before it's even begun. You're funny. Come on. Okay. [Hopeful music playing] [Mira] Okay, okay, one more, one more. Um... would you rather say everything you're thinking or never say anything at all?

And I still can't believe it. - [Groans] I'm sorry. I'm just... - No, no. You can't really prepare for something like that, can you? I was so sure we'd grow old together. And now I'm the only one growing older. He's exactly the same. Same eyes... Same voice, same smile. Exactly how I remember it. I'm the only one who's changing. All right, enough about me.

[Clears throat] But, uh, are you any good? Well, you're just gonna have to find out, now, mister. [Both chuckle] I really like your voice. Tell me more about why you like basketball. I feel like you can learn more by playing ten minutes of basketball with someone than you can talking to them for a whole hour. How they work with other people. Face opposition. And not to sound too grandiose or anything... But kind of feel the game represents life itself. All these people are from different places... Gathered to play the same game. [Gentle music playing] Different cultures, races. It doesn't matter where you're from. Yeah. Yeah, it's what makes this country, this city, so... So beautiful.

I poured roxy and me two shots. I drank them both, as I always do. Then I lit a candle, and I said to roxy, "I will always be your husband. But what I'm really missing, like in my core, is sharing a joke with someone when I'm feeling down in the mouth." And dead people, not so funny. So, um... Thank you. - [Lilting pensive music playing] - What can we do? Huh? Oh, nothing. Nothing. Rob ruined it. What was I supposed to do? You should have said something to her right away. What should I have said? "Excuse me, I'd like to get to know you, but I keep getting these text messages you write your dead boyfriend. I would have said something earlier, but I didn't wanna take away the possibility for you to stay in contact with him.

"This was actually supposed to be a profile on céline Dion as she continues on her first American tour in over ten years at the barclays center this weekend. My assignment was to get her to open up, reveal who she really is. Unfortunately, I did not succeed. Instead, miss Dion opened me. When she told me I wasn't capable of hearing her music, I scoffed. What was there to hear? A bunch of sentimental platitudes on life and love? I had no room for such nonsense in my life because..." [Rob] ...Because I knew love was a myth. A shared delusion between two people that could end as soon as someone changed their mind. Then I got your texts. Slowly, I began to realize céline was right. I couldn't hear the music. 'Cause my heart had given up on love. I know you didn't mean to text me your innermost thoughts and feelings, but you did. And I made a big mistake by not telling you that right away. And I do not deserve a second chance. But thanks to you, I can hear the music again. I hear it in the sound of your voice when you call my name. Your laughter after asking me ridiculous "would you rather" questions. And that slow, gentle breath you take just before falling asleep. I know love is real 'cause I've fallen in love with you. And if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I promise I'll do everything I can to earn your trust back. 'Cause a new day has come for me, Mira. Where it was dark, now it's light. Where there was pain, now there's joy. Where there was weakness, I found my strength. And I'm not afraid to tell the world... I've been touched by an angel with love. Meet me tonight at the place where I learned to hear the music again. "Please give this another chance. Please give me another chance." [Song fades] [Cell phone ringing] [Groans] Seriously? She listening? - Céline Dion. - [Gasps] What even is your life right now? Just... - Hello? - [Céline] First off, I want you to know that Rob didn't put me up to this. - Sure. - You know I lost my husband, yes? He was the first and only love of my life. I'm so sorry. René may have lied to me once before we were married. He did? Yeah. About seal. The animal... The singer, seal. Of course. It was 1991, and seal, the singer, had just released his first album. I wanted to sing a duet with him so badly, but rené told me he wasn't too interested. Turns out rené was jealous. He didn't want me around seal at all. Were you mad when he lied? Of course I was mad. But we worked through it. Because that's what you do when you're in love. You work through things. Also, rené agreed to do the dishes for life in return for my forgiveness. - You guys did your own dishes? - No. We don't do a lot of dishes. But you get the point? [Exhales] I'm just a bit confused. Look, Mira. I don't really care whether you and Rob get together. You don't? No. My only concern is you. Now... How's my poster coming along? I'm working on it. [Hughes yells] Have you lost your mind? This is a newspaper. Not some sort of dating service. What am I supposed to tell our publishers, eh? What are they gonna say? They are serious people. You have put the entire newspaper's reputation at risk! Rob, this is the most unprofessional behavior I have ever seen in my life! No! You total dickhead! I have to make them think I'm ripping you to shreds. Or else they'll all try and publish stories about their personal lives.

It's great for you 'cause, uh, well, I've decided you can do your podcast. What? Seriously? That's amazing. Well, you gotta win her back now. Make for a hell of a follow-up piece.
