September 4, 1980 palermo, Saint rosalia's day cosa nostra bosses meet at Stefano bontade's villa. Palermo is the world capital of heroin. The old palermo mafia and the new corleone clan meet to divvy up the heroin trade, thus avoiding another mafia war. The fugitive tommaso buscetta,"boss of two worlds", is also present. As a simple "soldier", he can not participate in the meeting, but he has influence with bontade, head of the palermo alliance. Buscetta attends with his third wife Christina and children from his previous marriages. Where are you going? Papal! - Papa... - C'mon, get up! Get up! - Papa, why are you hitting me? - Benedetto, let's go. Papa, I love you. God is love. Gimme a hug, papa. A toast to our friends. And to our families. And to money! Cheers! Here, take your brother! Come, let's dance to something lively! Let's dance! Music, maestro! What's wrong? Your wife's good, isn't she? She raised all these kids without having kids and stepkids. Masino, will you tell me what's wrong? Do you see benedetto? He looks done in. Yeah, done in... - How did it end up? - All good. Why don't you have them come with us? They don't want to, this is their life. - You have to force them. - They're not kids anymore. Antonio's made me a grandfather. Stop talking nonsense. You don't want them. Yeah, I don't want them in Brazil. They're lost. A photo! A nice photo! This will be fun! - Hide that gun. - Why, can you see it? Masino, come here! Toto, you come here too. Everyone's gotta be in it. The kids too, here. For this beautiful family and for this peace that must never end. Peace? A farse... Be careful. The first to start, never loses. Long live Saint rosalia! The infirm want your grace. Long live Saint rosalia! Step by step we'll bring you. Long live Saint rosalia! In every street on every road. Long live Saint rosalia! He who does not say it with me is not a devotee. Long live Saint rosalia! Thunder and storms and we call you. I'm leaving. When? Why are you leaving now? Things are getting better, can't you see all the money circulating? You can't take money to the grave with you. You have to look after benedetto and Antonio. You know they're like sons to me. The traitor December 1980, Rio de Janeiro, grumari beach be careful, it's dangerous! The water's dangerous. You're freezing. I couldn't get out of the water. Remember, father, your church spread all over the earth, make it perfect in love and in the union with our pope John Paul... Stefano, I baptize you in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. Thank you. Long live Stefano! We have a problem with the stopover. When the undersecretary realized it was for planes arriving from Peru, Bolivia and Colombia... Two plus two equals four. - How much did he ask you for? - One and a half. Let's make it two... three. All right. I'd like to go live there with all my family. In amazonia? - You want to be a hermit? - Let's go. Your excellency. Mr felici! What a lovely family you have! Thank you very much. Madam. Yes, the truth is I'm happy here with my family, my father-in-law... We're among friends and when you're among friends you can get around any problem. Gentlemen, please. Hold it. One more. What's he doing here? Here we go... Don't be afraid, pippo. Stay down! You gotta be quiet. Out! - It was out! - Masino, it was in! No, it was out. Mr felici, a personal call for you. It's over. Drinks for everyone, on me. That was a goal! Hello? How are you? Who's this? Don't you recognize me? A friend, masino. How are you? The family all good? - What'd you say at your pa's funeral? - What did I say? You said you want to avenge him. Yeah, it's true. Whoever killed him's gonna meet the same end! Have you ever fired a gun? Yes. With the right or with the left? I don't understand. Everything okay? Everything good? All quiet, sir. Papa! Sit down. When a brother dies it's like losing an arm. Be strong, masino. Totuccio was saved by a miracle and now he wants to slaughter the corleonesi with his bare hands. But what can he do alone? He hasn't got this. But you've got this. Tano, what do you want? All the heroin in the world passes through palermo, there's billions for everyone. And the corleonesi are wiping out half the world, women, kids... You know what scarpuzzedda did? To Toto inzerillo's son? First he cut off his arm, then he killed him. What need was there? You're not even safe here. Stefano wanted to stop riina, he spoke to the commission about it, he wanted to shoot him. Why didn't they do it? They would have, but riina is smart and he didn't go to the meeting. Who's still on our side? We're losing many of them along the way, they've gone over to those louts of riina's. But we're not dead yet, we're not dead, we can still make it. But you gotta come back. You get me? The salvos told me too, ignazio asked me. Besides, we're not alone in Rome, there's still our friends. - What does pippo say? - Mr calo? He's in Rome, he says he's working for his career. I'm not scared of dying, I'm not scared of anything, but to go there and tell them: "Here I am, kill me"... why? For glory? Like the kamikazes? Am I a jerk? We gotta kill them, before they kill us. We need to think it through, tano. - Hello? - It's me. Can you hear me? I can't hear you very well. - Benedetto and Antonio... - Are you crying? - Benedetto and Antonio are gone. - Put my wife on. Hello? Masino, I'm here. What's going on? Did you call Cal? Of course, but he never answers. Masino, you gotta come here immediately. They're our sons, your sons! They've gone, don't you see? What do you mean he never answers? You gotta come here! I'll take care of it now. I'll take care of it now! Why aren't you in bed? I was waiting for you. What's going on? Nothing. Nothing. Stay here! Stay calm. I'm putting it down, stay calm. Stay calm. Mr tommaso "busketta‚Äù we have a warrant for your arrest and to search your house. - His name is Roberto felici. - Start with his office. Then the bedrooms, I want to find the drugs. There are no drugs here. So where's the money, then? If you collaborate things will be much easier. Here's his passport, his name's Roberto felici. You're in the wrong house. For the love of god... Enough! Shut up! Shut up! - Mr "busketta"... - Buscetta. My name is tommaso buscetta, you need to say it properly. Cuff him. Let's start the search. Please. Who did you traffic heroin with? Speak! Who's your contact? Speak, you filthy trafficker! July 7, 1984 Rio de Janeiro, talavera Bruce prison Italy's beautiful, isn't it? Yes. But I'm not going there on vacation. I know all of Italy, or rather all the prisons of Italy. Want a cigarette? Thanks. How far to the airport? First we have to stop by the hospital to get you checked out, the government wants to ensure they send you to Italy in good health. They want to show that you have been treated well in Brazil. What's happening to him? Hold his head! Go faster! Faster to the hospital. - Did he poison himself? - He's having convulsions! Go faster! Go faster, before he dies on us here. Darling. You're safe. July 14, 1984 Rio de Janeiro, extradition to Italy You all right? Doctor? What's wrong? Breathe. Breathe, come on. That's it. Breathe, slowly. - De gennaro? - Yes? - Where are you taking me? - Judge Falcone will explain it to you. - I'm not talking to anyone. - All right. Rest now, just relax. You're not eating? I'm not hungry, thank you. No, it's not necessary. July 15, 1984 Rome, fiumicino airport tommaso buscetta, 56, known as Don masino has returned to his homeland in handcuffs, hidden under a blanket. A week ago, the head of the sicilian mafia tried to kill himself in Brazil with strychnine, but it didn't help him avoid extradition. His presence had become awkward for the Brazilian authorities. In south America, Don masino had created a fortune starting in the '60s. He was first been extradited from Brazil in 1972, incarcerated first at the ucciardone, then in turin, following a conviction for drug trafficking, buscetta managed to escape from turin in 1980, where he had obtained semi-Liberty and took refuge in Brazil. Linked to the badalamentis and other families of the so-called "failing" palermo mafia... July 16, 1984 Rome, San vitale police headquarters wait here. I'd like you to meet mr pajno, the prosecutor of palermo, and judge Giovanni Falcone. I wanted to reassure you personally that your family has full protection in the United States. Also, at the judiciary committee a law is being considered, also in Italy, to offer material guarantees and personal safety to state informants. I am not an informant. Yes, of course. You're free to make all the statements you want. I only wanted to inform you that the state is not inert. Good, then I'll leave you to judge Falcone. All the best with it. So, first name and last name. Buscetta tommaso. The late benedetto and the late bauccio Felicia, born in palermo July 13, 1928, elementary school, no military service, married with children, agricultural businessman. - Previously convicted. - It's the law... Yes, yes. Good. Shall we start? I'm not an informant. Changed your mind? I confess I'm surprised, I thought you wanted to collaborate, that's why we came here. I'm not a spy, a rat... I have been a man of honor and I'm ready to pay my debt with the law. Now then... There's one question I will not answer. Actually, I'll answer it before you ask me. I have never trafficked drugs. It's pointless asking me. How much do you smoke? - None left? - No. Take mine. Right... Shall we start with your affiliation? To give the questioning an order. I'm tired. Good. Read and sign here. - The packet. - Keep it, I have another one. - Good day, then. - And to you. - If you need anything, send for me. - Thank you. - Never leave him by himself. - Do I leave the door open? Would you like me to turn on the TV? That's not necessary, thank you. - Have any preference for lunch? - I'm not hungry. - Something light. - All right. Mama. What's happening? Masino, what have you done? How could you leave me? My husband, what have you done? You left me with these kids... Masino, my husband. What a weight I feel in my chest! Our pillar is leaving us... My son, come with me. Come with me. My beautiful boy... What's going on? Judge Falcone will do the next interrogation in here. Why? Mr de gennaro ordered it for your safety. There's a phone call for you from your wife. Turn them on, please. Thank you. - Cristina? - Darling. - Sweetheart, are you all right? - Yes. - The kids? - They're safe, they're well. Everyone's asleep, they're tired. And you? How are you feeling? I'm fine... I'm fine. Where have they put you? In a house for the time being, I have everything I need. Tomorrow they're moving us somewhere else, I hope it's permanent. That's all I can say. What have you decided? Masino, think of the kids, they're asking about you, they want to see you again. Sodol. You have to talk. What's that noise? What are you wearing? I'm not wearing anything. Let's start with the question I asked you last Wednesday, the first and only one: Your affiliation. - When did you enter the mafia? - The mafia doesn't exist. The mafia is an invention of the press. "Cosa nostra", we call it. That's what we men of honor call it. You have to imagine a pyramid, on the base of which there are soldiers. I'm a soldier, a simple soldier. The soldier swears an oath of absolute loyalty to cosa nostra and for his whole life he cannot leave cosa nostra. Three families form a mandamento, each with a capomandamento, a boss. At the apex of this pyramid there's the commission, with the head of the commission who is elected by the soldiers of all the families. I swore loyalty to cosa nostra, the old one, over forty years ago. I was a kid. Last time I accepted your cigarettes because the packet was open. A carton, a new packet, I'd never have accepted. This organization that's so well structured... - What was your rank? - Simple soldier. With all your prestige, your authority, a simple soldier, why? You're a natural leader. My character. I've never been interested in commanding, I wanted to be free to travel, to play, to have fun. I've always liked women. Riina used to say: "Better to command than to fuck." For me it's the opposite. And riina's never been able to stand that. He's obsessed with power, much more than with money, which he doesn't enjoy at all. I'd left, I'd got out of the way, but that wasn't enough for riina. He slaughtered half my family, my sons... To force me to come back so he could kill me too. He's a sick soul. I'd like to tell you a story. I was very young, I was around sixteen, newly affiliated. My capo orders me to kill a person. It was the day this person's son was getting baptized and I waited outside the church. When he sees me, because he knew me by sight, he realizes he's been condemned to death and I was supposed to kill him. He immediately tears his son away from his mother and hugs him tight. I couldn't shoot, I couldn't frighten the baby. From that day on, he always left home accompanied by his son. They were inseparable, he took him to kindergarten, to elementary school, to middle school, up until high school. Then the son got married. In those days you didn't touch kids. Women, judges... Cosa nostra had values, principles shared by everyone... What values? To protect poor people. I knew a capo, gaetano filippone, he traveled by tram, died penniless. - But do you really believe in it? - In what? You don't honor your intelligence, killing carabinieri and judges, ruining kids with heroin... I'm talking about before heroin, there's a difference. And in fact, I left. Sure, before heroin men of honor didn't kill people... There are countless stories of atrocious crimes, the old and noble mafia is a myth, enough! There's something else I have to say to you. You're known as the boss of two worlds, how did you earn that title? You've never pleaded guilty to a serious crime, if you admitted to something you'd be more credible. Before you said you didn't like to shoot, but rather to watch. Don't jerk me around, buscetta! Judge Falcone, we made a deal. I'm respecting it. You can sign. Now you'll become a celebrity, but they'll try to destroy you. Professionally and physically. You can die for so many reasons, a car accident, a plane exploding in flight, cancer... Death is always with us, we die and that's it. I only want to die in my bed. That would do me, it'd be a fine victory. They put us in together. High season, all booked out. - Are you done? - Thanks, Michele. Good night. Good night. What's this judge Falcone like? I don't trust anyone. How many of your relatives has riina killed? Riina and his scumbag friends killed two cousins of mine, a few of my wife's relatives, honest people who weren't even in cosa nostra. Then they killed the doctor who patched me up when they shot me, those mad dogs really let him have it. We let them take too much space. Yes, but now riina, his whole family, his descendants, his friends... We'll kill them one by one. For my troubled mind and my pain, I'd like to kill them with myself. Pippo calo too, sly and cuckold. Let's do judge Falcone a favor and get rid of all this garbage, let's make him happy, too. Totuccio, cosa nostra is over, now you just have to talk. Good night. Remember when we were in ucciardone? We ate lobster, there was champagne and caviar... Here they brought us zucchini, rice and carrots. What kind of jail is this, masino? And all the pussy that came in? What sensational fucks we had... What grand sluts they were. How old are you? Still young. Winter 1974 palermo, ucciardone prison get out, buscetta's gotta fuck. Get out, move. - Get out, he's gotta fuck. - C'mon, get out. Get out! Get undressed. Scarpuzzedda... Giuseppe greco, known as scarpuzzedda. Killer of Stefano bontade, of Salvatore inzerillo. Tano badalamenti told me in Brazil that before he killed inzerillo's son, he cut off his arm. Come in. Thank you, put it here. I read in your eyes you thought it might be poisoned. I did, it's true. But for me or for you? Thank you. We've drunk so many, why now? No, no, precisely because we're winding up. Do you really think that what you've written is still secret? Men of honor are not only in sicily, only, they've learned how to knot their ties. Give me names, accusing the state means nothing. There are no untouchables for me. I'm more afraid of the state than the mafia. So, you want names from me? You don't know them? You read those names every day in the papers. You're a judge, you know that to accuse someone you need proof. The proof will come. No one imagined that you'd collaborate, yet you're doing it. Judge Falcone, we only have to decide one thing, who has to die first, you or me? Let's continue. - With this. - That's bagarella leoluca. He personally killed Boris giuliano. That's the pope, Michele greco, the head of the commission, that is... Because riina moves him like a puppeteer. Buscetta talks mafia commission revealed by a boss on his knees blow to the mafia judge Falcone convinces tommaso buscetta to talk attack to the heart of the mafia bosses brought to their knees the darkest day truth about 120 crimes 366 arrest warrants buscetta's confessions historical blow to crime blitz will go down in history its over Pietro! Pietro! Help! Dec. 7, 1984, Pietro busetta, buscetta's brother-in-law Here I am. - Mrs buscetta... - Don't call me buscetta anymore. I renounce that name and I renounce tommaso buscetta! Don't call him my brother, anymore, I don't want to hear that name. He destroyed my family's peace, he made our life hell! We've been living in fear since that man started talking. They killed my husband because of my last name! Just because of my last name! At home we've stopped living. I don't want to be called buscetta anymore! And if he is a real man he should kill himself. He should hang himself like Judas iscariot! Ma'am, do you believe in Christian forgiveness? Yes, but first he has to kill himself and then I'll forgive him. Who is it? Throw some stuff in a bag and come down. Hurry! Calo, don't be afraid, it's the police. You're under arrest. You're making a mistake, my name's Mario agliadoro. March 30, 1985 Rome, pippo calo's arrest badalamenti emanuele, not present. February 10, 1986 palermo, maxi trial begins the defendant bagarella calogero, at large. Bagarella leoluca, at large. The defendant brusca Giovanni, not present. The defendant buscetta tommaso, not present. The defendant calamia giuseppe, present. The defendant calista gaetano, present. The defendant calo giuseppe, present. The defendant contorno antonino, present. The defendant contorno Salvatore, not present. The defendant ennio... The defendant has sewn his mouth shut. Who? Salvatore ercolano sewed his mouth shut. Mr president! Can you speak into the intercom? Go on. Salvatore ercolano, my companion in misfortune, asked me to read this message. "My only defense is my mouth, but no one believes this mouth, so I sewed it shut." How did he get a needle and thread? What have you done? You have to speak to us! You can't do things on your own. With this gesture, mr president, my client intends to protest against the system of so-called "penitents‚Äù, who unjustly accuse him. Very well, counselor. Can we proceed with the roll call? Faia Salvatore, present... Help! Help! Sinagra Vincenzo is throwing a fi, shouting unintelligibly. Let's resume the roll call. Greco Michele, at large. Mom, help me! Again? I don't believe it! Hey, check me out! - It's a madhouse in here. - A lunatic show. Get a load of my dick! We need a resident psychiatrist. - Mr president? - Speak into the intercom. Excuse me, I'm suffering from a certain nervousness due to the fact that since this morning I have eyes on me, in front of me and behind. These guards here staring at me... I've got nothing against them, but I need to look you judges in the eye. I need to look, because looking is important, a gaze can beat you up, it can even kill. As Michel butor said: "The gaze is the expression of reality." I need to look into the eyes of those I'm being judged by. These are standard security measures, mr leggio. But what's standard security? Making the prisoner nervous? Preventing him from listening? Teresa, blood of my blood! My husband is not a traitor! They didn't sell out! What do you say? Do you want to see it by the light of day? If I could, thank you. - What do you think? - Can I see something else? Certainly, why not? - I'd like to try that one on. - Very good. Is that andreottl? Yes, it's andreotti. Here you are. What kind of function is it for? A wedding? For a daytime function gray is also attractive. The president is leaving. Goodbye, president. Goodbye. Goodbye, president. April 2, 1986 palermo Buscetta snitchand traitor buscetta filth What do we do? Nothing, let them pass. Long live the mafia that gives us work Buscetta, we've put you in here. You'll be able to follow the trial on television. You have my number, call me whenever you want. You're being watched 24 hours a day, you'll never be alone. A favor, may I see the courtroom? Of course, follow me. - Where does calo sit? - In cell number 16. Very well. April 1963 palermo, calo and buscetta April 3, 1986 buscetta's first deposition the smoking ban applies to everyone, I can't make exceptions and we can't step in every time to apply the ban. I'm asking for permission to smoke a cigar, not cigarettes, for therapeutic reasons and not for pleasure. Due to abuse in my youth, my breathing is compromised, the doctor said if I don't smoke, I'll hyperventilate. I mean, I have to smoke. I believe you, but you'll need to bring me a medical certificate and I'll authorize it immediately. Let us proceed. I believe counselor costa wishes to speak. Yes, mr president, I wish to communicate to you, that the defendant tommaso buscetta, who had declined to appear, is at the disposal of the court. Good, then let's interrogate him. Silence, it's just a first interrogation, there will be others. Bring in the defendant. Mr buscetta! Mr buscettal! Don masino! You can't take pictures of the defendant with a flash, or call out his name. So, buscetta, you... During the investigative phase, gave many interviews for a total of 487 pages. Yes and I confirm it all. I was and remain a man of honor. I entered cosa nostra with a certain spirit and inside me that spirit hasn't changed. They are the ones who have betrayed the ideals of cosa nostra. This is why, mr president, I do not consider myself an informer. Mr president, I ask to be interrogated. - Speak into the intercom. - I don't need it. They can hear me anyway. Besides, I have to look at you directly. And since mr buscetta has told a bunch of lies, for example, he says he doesn't know me, but I state that he knows me. I demand an opportunity to ask this gentleman questions. Very well, you may ask questions during cross-examination. Let the record reflect that. Mr president! I too, tommaso spadaro, ask to be interrogated. I can prove that buscetta is a liar. Very well, you may also be cross-examined. - I have certain documents... - Very well. Mr president! It's me. Excuse me, huh. My name is giuseppe bono and I want to look that rat buscetta in the eye! Mr president! I'd like to be cross-examined with mr buscetta too. Very well, let the record reflect that... Spadaro tommaso, bono giuseppe and also add calo giuseppe. Is there anybody else? I long for this cross-examination, mr president. April 10, 1986 - cross-examination between calo and buscetta Traitor! Buscetta, you're a ball-less loser! Cuckold! Mr president, we can't see buscetta and it's important we see his face. It's called "face to face". No and no! The lawyers may not see either the defendants or the witness. This is something you learn in the first year at university. Then, I have a different penal code, I have never read that a lawyer may not look the defendant in the face. You will do without, security reasons dictate it. But, mr president, buscetta is a defendant, he is not padre pio of pietrelcina. This glass booth places us in a position of inferiority. They want to convict us all. Right, because in Rome there's some big shot who's making deals to keep us in here. That's the truth! Enough! Enough! Gentlemen, enough! Those defendants who do not observe religious silence will be ejected from the court. Well, let us begin. Listen, calo, why did you ask to be cross-examined with tommaso buscetta? What are your objections? You've read the transcripts? Yes, I've read them. And it's all false, starting with the fact that we know each other. I knew his brother well, not him. We were friends, we've known each other since we were kids. I got him into cosa nostra. Then he became the boss of our mandamento, porta nuova, before crossing over to the corleonesi. It's not true I was friend of his brother, who was very fond of me. The one who's alive or the one you killed? Buscetta, I'll ask the questions. Really... may I continue? - Please. - Speak! I was talking about this brother, Vincenzo. I spent a year and a half with this brother in the same cell. One day, mr president, practically with tears in his eyes, he said: "Look what masino did to me. He's gone again and he's left me with one son in prison and the other one a junkie, he destroyed them." I'm telling you this to make you understand what mr masino buscetta is capable of. Buscetta, do you wish to reply? I'm angry with... - Angry? - With him... Because in 487 pages of interrogation, I never touched on anybody's family problems. And I never will family, for me, is sacred. Even yours. Calo, you dispute that you and buscetta know each other. Of course, I'm just meeting him now, now that he's famous, but he and I have never been friends. We've never been friends? Never, I don't know you. Mr president, may I show the court proof which may be helpful in demonstrating the truth? Please proceed. Marshal, if you would... thank you. That's me, not my brother. Together, no? Hugging. See, see. The hand on my shoulder is his. Can you see it? Please, let the record reflect that. Mr president, I entrust myself to your intelligence, and the intelligence of the court. According to this gentleman I must be friends with all the people I meet either at weddings or baptisms and I'm supposed to remember all these people? Don't you remember? I gave my blood for your son when he needed it. I gave my blood, you lying scoundrel! - You'd sell out your own mother. - You're a liar! Enough, please! Please, enough! There... there... - Mafioso consent, there it is. - You're a liar. Enough! You're the liar and you're also a swindler. You've swindled all of Italy. For that you deserve a kiss and a medal, but only for that. The medal yes, the kiss, no, because I remind you that you kissed my sons and let them be killed. How dare you accuse me? Why didn't you have me killed too? - Buscetta... - Don't call me buscetta. - Call me something else. - My dear buscetta... Don't call me buscetta. God is great, my dear buscetta. - God is great and I believe in him. - Don't say "dear". I believe in miracles. Now I'm well guarded, you'll have to wait to shoot me. - You'll have to wait a few years. - All right, we'll wait. - Good. - I'll wait. Finally, for once you've been Sincere. If we're resorting to threats, we will suspend this cross. You call these threats? I'll tell you something new. Unknown. Filthy rat spy. It's not in the statements, I just remembered now, mr president. - Are you willing to hear it? - Go on. - The latest arrival. - What? Unlike you, my memory still helps me. In 1979, I am in prison, I open the newspaper and read: "Missing..." A person, a member of his family because I no longer belong to it. As soon as I run into mr calo I ask him: "What did giannuzzo do to be disappeared?" Remember what you said? "The commission told me to." "Yes, but did you tell the commission that he was a good boy, that he'd suffered hunger, prison, that he had no one?" "The commission told me to, I had to do it." Giannuzzo lallicata was your protege, you killed him with your own hands. A man of our family, but instead of protecting him, of asking what he was guilty of... What are you talking about? Instead of asking what he had done to be snuffed out... I mean, really... These things you're pulling out... - Are they things they tell you to say? - What? - Who? - I don't know. You just keep insisting with lies. Yes, now the judges will decide if these are lies. Because otherwise you can't take the prize, am I right? You can't take the prize. The fact is you don't want to go away defeated. I am defeated, I'm incarcerated like you, I've lost everything. I've lost my family, my friends, my freedom, I've lost it all. That's your business, you know what you've done. Hypocrite. You ought to recite "mea culpa‚Äù, you know the facts. Hypocrite. Mr president, he knows perfectly well how much I respected his brother and his sons. Hypocrite. When he says these things, it really hurts me. He knows perfectly well that when his brother died, I was sorrier about it than him, he was... He was in Brazil! Leading the high life, - partying and taking it easy. - Hypocrite. Only after that he turned informer! - Hypocrite. - And why don't you turn informer too? Say things. All right. I'd say that we can end this cross-examination right here. Escort calo back to his cell. I wish you a good day. We can proceed with the next cross-examination. Spadaro. My client declines the cross-examination. Bono? My client declines the cross-examination. Leggio? He declines the cross-examination. Does anyone else wish to cross-examine tommaso buscetta? Let's go smoke, mr president. April 11, 1986 Salvatore contorno's deposition Please, enough! Silence! Silence! Silence! Silence! Contorno, you spoke about drug trafficking, about how everyone got rich and became millionaires. As long as we had cigarette smuggling it all worked fine, then when heroine came in they lost their minds over the money, they always wanted more. But now all the kids are dying, even their sons. They've been bereaved by drugs, too. - Didn't your son die from aids? - Silence! Will you let us continue? Wasn't the other one shot to death? Shut up! Wasn't your son shot to death? He was the son of that guy who shot me at brancaccio, who had a sister, who also died from heroine, it was in all the papers. They're losing everything, their kids, their blood, but they go on like sheep, like they taught me in school... I had a teacher who made me understand, then she retired... And the sheep fall into the ravine one after another. Mr riina takes a step to the side and the sheep all end up in the ravine, none are spared. President, we need an interpreter here. My colleagues from the mainland haven't understood a word. Contorno, enough, stop speaking like that. Look, they can't understand you. Speak proper Italian. It's habit, if I don't talk fast I lose my train of thought. - Sorry. - Eh, sorry... What was I saying? I don't remember. You were talking about drugs... Exactly. If you follow what I'm saying... With drugs the earnings are enormous, and they've all gone off the rails. Cosa nostra isn't "our thing" anymore, now it's "my thing". They even kill newborn babies. And you call these men of honor? You're a scoundrel! The scoundrel is you, mr Luciano liggio! Cuckold! Snitch! Who are you calling a snitch‚Äù? You bastard cuckold! How can you allow that? Contorno, you need to look at me and not make gestures! If they call me a cuckold, I insult them. No, you mustn't make gestures at the cages! But I'm not a cuckold. You're the president? Then be the president. What are you talking about? If they insult me, I insult them, or else I'll get up and go! - Contorno, please. - What are we going to do here? Sit down. May we resume, please? You were talking about earnings from drug trafficking. Exactly. The money from drugs, kidnapping, etc., mr pippo calo handled it all. He and riina are like the cat and the fox in Pinocchio. Then, after they shot me, I left palermo. You're referring to the attack against you on June 25, 1981. I don't remember the exact day, I don't want to remember such a horrible day. We cannot go on like this, we are in a court of law. - Contorno has to speak in Italian! - He's incomprehensible. Italian... Italian. I've always spoken sicilian dialect, mr president, I don't know how to speak Italian, so it's sicilian or nothing. If some Italian comes to me, I'll speak Italian, if sicilian comes to me, I'll speak sicilian, or else I'll get up and go. Let's proceed with calm, try at least to speak a little more slowly. Yeah, slowly... So, you were saying that after you were attacked, you moved to Rome. Yes, to Rome. I went to look for mr pippo calo. Again... - Since he commanded all of Rome. - All lies. - But I mean, all of it. - Yes, but look at me! Don't look there, look at me! Both because Rome could hide me because Rome's big, and because I could go and kill mr calo. Judge Falcone. I hate them, because they killed my relatives. The main motive for the killing was... Leaving? Yeah. One last cigarette? - Here. - Thanks. You're not glad to be going home? America isn't my home, my home is here. Of course, I'm happy to go back to my wife, to my kids. I've had eight kids. My father did better than me, I'm the last of seventeen. Judge Falcone, you don't... Life is not eternal, it's better with kids. I like kids. We'll wait for the sentence and then who knows... Fair enough. This war has just begun. The ones pulling the strings are in Rome, that's where we need to go without getting killed. Die in your own bed. And as late as possible. The mafia is not invincible, it had a beginning, it will have an end. As soon as possible, let's hope, so I can return to palermo and go eat a nice gelato in mondello. Have a good trip. Shall we go? December 16, 1987 the sentence In the name of the Italian people, the first assizes court of palermo, on December 16, 1987, in accordance with the law, declares: Bagarella leoluca, 6 years. Bono giuseppe, 23 years. Brusca Bernardo, a life sentence. Buscetta tommaso, 3 years and 6 months. Calo giuseppe, 23 years and a fine of 200 million. Contorno Salvatore, 6 years.

Vernengo antonino, 16 years. Winter 1990 Salem, New Hampshire Light of my life, come here. Careful. What did you do today? Nothing, I went shopping. The life of the unemployed. - It was on sale. - You already have a weapon. Yeah, but I feel safer. I promised Stefano I'd take him to dinner with tommaso and his girl. Is that a problem? No. Like some wine? Sure, red. Good morning Italy, good morning Maria with your eyes so lacking in cheer good morning god to you you know I am here too let me sing to you my guitar I'll play too let me sing a nice slow song to you let me sing loud because I am proud I am sicilian I am sicilian and I'm proud Let's go home. The roof? It opens and closes... That way your cuckold's horns stick out. If you can eat in the car? Bring what you want and eat it. Ah, heating! It's got it. Pussy? Yeah, your sister's pussy... You're really pissing me off, we've been talking for three hours take the keys and go to the boss. Ah, the money... 5,000 dollars. Come on, move it, you're pissing me off. Get outta here, go. Useless thing. - Is he taking it? - Of course he's taking it. He's holding the keys, he has to take it. It was like a conversation between deaf-mutes. You still haven't learned english? I don't even speak Italian, let alone english. Anyway, I talk with my hands. Why did you call me? I'll show you this cool car. I haven't got any money. - Earning well? - Earning. We get by, thank god. We get by... We were used to millions, billions... Now I have to let my wife support me. That bugs me. What's that? A gun in your pocket? I always carry it here, on me, like John Wayne. And Gary Cooper... But I'll leave it here, I'll find something in palermo. Revolvers, kalashnikovs, grenades, whatever you want. You're going back to palermo, to Italy? I can't relax until I've sorted everything out. Riina is still alive, I can't rest until I've whacked him. By yourself? - You wanna get killed? - I'm not alone. Besides, I got nothing to lose. But I gotta kill riina and calo, no two ways about it. Calo's in prison, he needs to stay there the rest of his life. I know, but my plan's good. To begin with, I pop riina, then I let them catch me and put me in prison with calo. In novara? He's got important connections. He'll end up escaping, do we let him escape? You're crazy. I know. That's what my head tells me. - What about your wife? - She'll wait. - Here? - She'll wait for me here. She knows I can't change, I'm a free spirit. Not even god almighty can change me. And you'll go back to Italy, to sicily, the gelato in mondello... That was the last thing I said to Falcone when we said goodbye. He shook my hand. May 23, 1992 capaci, palermo Shall I pour the coffee? I'll give the keys to giuseppe, I'll see you tonight at home. All right. Good evening, here are the first images of the shocking attack in which judge Giovanni Falcone lost his life... Let's celebrate this great cuckold! At last you're out of the fucking way! To the judge's good health! Dramatic scenes, scenes of warfare. That soil covers what was once a tract of the 20km highway... Disgusting piece of shit, dead at last! Dog! Useless thing! He's fucked off out of the way! Cheers! For those of us present, because celebrating the lord's easter we may die to sin and rise again to new life, let us pray. L, rosaria costa, widow of officer vito schifani... In the name of all those I ask first that justice be done, now. Speaking to the men of the mafia, because they are in here, certainly not christians, know that you too can be forgiven. I forgive you, but you have to kneel down. If you have the courage to change... But they won't change. I've got to go back to Italy. Why do you have to go back? Did de gennaro ask you to? I want to go back to Italy. I promised Falcone. You promised him? - But Falcone's dead. - I have to go and that's it! You and Stefano will come with me. I'm not coming and nor is Stefano. He has school and I work. Cristina! We commend, lord, the faithful souls of our brothers Giovanni, Francesca, Antonio, Rocco, vito, who have departed this world that they may live with you. January 15, 1993 palermo - everyone ready? - Ready. Go around. Stay on his tall. Again. Keep going around. Don't touch the gun. You got the wrong person, my name's Alfredo bartolo. November 19, 1993 rebibbia, bunker courtroom - you claim you do not know buscetta. - I do not know him. You reject the allegations made against you by the prosecutor, based on declarations made by buscetta, contorno, mutolo, marchese, di maggio, calderone and you declare that you do not know these persons and you don't belong to the criminal association called cosa nostra. - Do you confirm this? - Yes, I confirm it. Listen, riina, when you refused to submit to cross-examination with buscetta, you made this statement, which I shall now read out. "Buscetta is not of my stature, he is a man with too many lovers." How do you know that? I didn't say "lovers", I said "wives". All right, wives, lovers... We get the point. So you know him? I read in the papers that he had three wives, he didn't love his kids, he abandoned them. I cannot speak to anyone with such low morals. When I speak of morals, mr president, I'm referring to my family. My grandfather was widowed at forty and he had five children. He never remarried. My mother was widowed at thirty-six. In our village, corleone, we live with moral rectitude. No one wants to force you to face buscetta, but you specifically asked to face him, and not only. Your honor, please do not insist. No, of course not, it's your right. I have already explained that I don't want to face him, that is my right and I shall exercise it. - Do I have the right to speak? - Certainly. Shit stain! Cuckold! Silence, please! Silence, please! Speak clean. Silence in there, please! And you, enough with the flashes, or I'll send you out! No swearing. You have the right to ask whatever you want to mr riina. I was expecting a lion's roar, I heard the squeak of a mouse. From what pulpit does this man preach, if you allow me... How dare he talk about morality? He, who has slaughtered and ordered the slaughter of so many innocent men. I chased after women, it's true, you went to bed only with your wife because all your time was for cosa nostra. To be the star, the boss of all bosses. And now you're locked in a cage where you'll stay all your life. Riina, are you amused? Will you tell us what amuses you? No comment. Is it an ironic or a sarcastic smile? Do you know the difference? Mr president, twenty years ago, a judge said: "The mafia will end when a mafioso talks." Now it's not just me who's talking, lots of people are talking. But they won't be the ones to destroy cosa nostra. You have him in front of you, sitting in that chair, the man who helped the state defeat cosa nostra. It's you, Salvatore riina, mr riina, the man who killed cosa nostra. And this is why, not so much me, but all of cosa nostra hates you. I don't hate you, if I hated you I'd do you a favor. For me you don't exist. If you have nothing else to add... It was a cross-examination and only I am speaking. Riina, have you anything to say? Enough, your honor. I've already spoken. Have you anything to add? I can stay here all night... Then, if you have nothing to add, you may be excused. - Thank you. - You too. You too. Bring in the next witness: Salvatore cancemi. He didn't want to give me the satisfaction. Salvatore cancemi, have you decided to collaborate? Yes, I decided to collaborate when Salvatore riina began order to have his enemies killed, up to the twentieth degree of relation, starting with children of six years old, because he said: "The seed must disappear". That is? - If I may, mr president... - Please. Seed is blood, those with buscetta's blood, bontade's, the inzerillos', the contornos', must be killed, wiped out. Everyone, from the elderly to the children, no one must remain. Thank you, counselor. Cancemi, you mentioned many crimes, how many of these crimes are you stained with? A lot. I made a list that I handed to the examining magistrate. Does this list include Antonio and benedetto buscetta, tommaso buscetta's sons? Yes, tommaso buscetta's sons were killed by me and pippo calo. What the fuck are you saying? You need to shut up! - You and me chocked buscetta's sons. - Shut up! You and me chocked buscetta's sons, who you'd known since they were kids. Shut up, filthy rat! You took the one that looked most like buscetta! - How much more crap you gotta talk? - Silence! - Which of buscetta's two sons? - Benedetto. - Where's your father? - I don't know. You have to tell me where your father is. Where is he? - Leave me alone. - Where is he? You don't know where your father is? You don't know? Where's your father? What do you want from me? I haven't done anything. Tell me where he is and [I'll leave you alone. Leave me alone! Antonio, benedetto, for the last time, where is your father? I don't know where my father is! Don't you get it? Leave benedetto for me. All right. I should have forced them to come to Brazil with me, I was their father, I should have forced them. People listen to me when I speak. I'm able to persuade them, I know. "Come with me and that's all..." And I didn't give a damn. I didn't think about them. I didn't even give them the freedom to betray me, they didn't know where I was. I was tortured, I know what that means, but I wasn't afraid, I was strong, but to take it out on them was cowardly, because they weren't anybody, they didn't count for anything. By themselves... They were my kids! Those hands... I remember, he caressed them as kids, he took them down from their high chairs. Calo strangled them, looking them in the eye till the end. The bastard's gotta die! Asinara island maximum security prison Tommaso buscetta, you have always reaffirmed your accusations against the corleonesi... No details: No hands, no watch. Sure. Today, you are taking a step you hadn't wished to take in the past, you accuse politicians and what politicians. Why have you changed your mind? I owe it to judge Falcone, to his memory. What was your relationship with Falcone? I loved Giovanni Falcone, may he rest in peace. I liked talking with him, reasoning, discussing. Even arguing, at times. I liked his mind, his brain. He was the only one who always understood what I said... And what I did not say. - You're not afraid... - I'm not afraid of anyone. Not even of dying. I am only a small man who had dignity in spades and I have to tell the truth, what I know. Bringing up the most important Italian politician, accusing him directly and indirectly, it is up to the magistrates to establish it, of ordering at least two killings. You were right, it is up to the magistrates to decide. "Cosa nostra knows how to wait", those are your words. Do you feel you're in danger? Yes, but I'm used to it now. It's not so much what tommaso buscetta is, it's that I have become a legend, and it's this legend that cosa nostra wants to destroy, to lift its head up again, to get back on its feet, to breathe free now that has a death rattle, because cosa nostra has a death rattle. We thank tommaso buscetta for his time. See you next week. Good night. Andreotti trial Rome, 1996 - not many people. - It's gone outta style. Save your voice because tonight we'll sing and dance. Go in, please. I'll go in alone. Buscetta, read the statement and give us your name and particulars. Aware of the moral and legal responsibilities I assume with my deposition, I swear to tell the truth and to hide nothing of which I have knowledge. Buscetta tommaso. Born palermo, July 13, 1928. Good, you may be seated. - Good morning, mr president. - Good morning to you. Counselor coppi, you may question the witness. Mr buscetta, you have stated that tano badalamenti told you that a specific task had been ordered by the honorable giulio andreotti to personages of the mafia, for them to eliminate pecorelli. The request was made to badalamenti by the salvo cousins. No, I asked you something else. Did tano badalamenti tell you there was a specific task requested by the honorable giulio andreotti? No, there was no specific task. Not that I know of. So, the fact that you attribute the honorable andreotti with an interest in killing mino pecorell, Carlo Alberto dalla chiesa and others, is the result of direct knowledge of yours or a deduction? - It is a deduction. - But a deduction is not a proof. It's nothing. Mr buscetta, how many crimes have you been charged with? Piece of shit. I was charged with murder and concealment of a body in catanzaro, and I have been convicted three times of criminal association. Were you not sentenced to eight years in salerno or... taranto? I wouldn't want to be wrong. No, you're not wrong, I was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for drug smuggling, in salerno, in... In 1975. Naturally, you were innocent. Not "naturally", I was innocent! Let's keep going. You have repeatedly maintained that while you were in Brazil you attempted suicide, but did you really intend to die? Mr president, the question is not relevant, we are entering into matters that are not procedural. Objection overruled. Buscetta, answer me. Did you intend to kill yourself? Yes. And why? Out of love for my family. Do you deny that this attempted suicide was a means to avoid or delay your extradition? I deny it. Mr buscetta, when you attempted suicide, do you remember writing on a piece of paper information that would have enabled the immediate identification of the substance you had ingested? And yet there is a report from the hospital you were admitted to saying that you wrote the letters s-t-r-y... So they understood you had ingested strychnine and could save you. They told me that, but I don't remember a doctor asking me, as he slapped me, "what have you taken?" And me writing it on a piece of paper. - I was unconscious, I don't know. - It's true. It's true because you wrote it and it's documented. But let's keep going. Did you receive financial aid from the state for collaborating? I began collaborating in 1984 and I received the first financial aid in 1992. In 1988, you received nothing? - Yes. - You contradict yourself. Then, how much? - We received... - We? I received 200 million lire to help my family. 200 million, does that not seem like financial assistance? Yes. Do you currently undertake any remunerative activity? None. So, what are your sources of income, your livelihood? - The state. - The state? And the income you receive, allows you to take cruises with your wife, to sing and dance? The cruise has nothing to do with the aid the government gives me. - It's from other proceeds. - Excuse me, what are they? Writing books. So you paid for the cruise with your own money? Yes, with my own money. - Can you prove it? - How can I? You can't, of course. And 20 million for plastic surgery with dr barzi, who paid for that? The state doesn't give you all this money to lie. But I'm not lying, I'm trying to tell things as they are. But then, if I am not able to translate it into words, it's because of my inadequate education and I apologize. - You lied to Falcone, too. - No, never. December 4, 1984, you told Falcone you suffered from renal tuberculosis. No, I told Falcone that I pretended in prison, that the disease was fake. - In fact, it was fake. - I just said so. You lie constantly, you are a liar! I object, these questions aren't relevant. But they are relevant, counselor. Because the witness lies about everything. And so, buscetta, let me say I, you are unreliable. Masino... Go on, sing a little song for us, too. Let me sing to you my guitar I'll play too I'm sicilian I'm sicilian and I'm proud why are you looking at me like that? Let's go, the cake! In honor of masino! Marvelous! Look what's written on it. Read it, come. "Happy birthday, your grandkids‚Äù, from them. It's 89, right? Sing, sing... I've lost my voice. Maestro, what do we do? Really? Thank you above all for listening to a man who, among other things, is also drunk. To your good health. Masino, legend! - Encore! - A drunk has to sing? He never stops... Change direction. The doctor has not given me good news. He said my levels have gone up again. You need to relax, it'll all be fine, what could kill you? In the end you die and that's it. What are you talking about? April 2, 2000 Miami, Florida Buscetta's revelations led to 366 "cosa nostra" arrests in Italy. Pippo calo is imprisoned in Milan. He is serving 5 life sentences in maximum security. Totuccio contorno, after serving 6 years, was arrested for drug trafficking. In 2004 he was arrested for extorsion. Today he is free. Riina died on November 17, 2017 in jail in parma. He was serving 19 life sentences in maximum security. Cristina, buscetta's third wife, still lives in witness protection in the usa. Buscetta died on April 2, 2000. He died in his bed as he'd wished. The traitor
