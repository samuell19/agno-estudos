I LOVE YOU –You don't listen. –What are you saying? –We're going out to eat. –I just need to finish writing this. –It's going so well. Please. –So what are you writing? That you're the world's most beautiful woman. You thought I should have this. This lovely plastic ring. The world's most expensive plastic ring. I don't believe you. Do you love me? –I love you. God, no! –Louder! Louder! I love you! 18 YEARS LATER –You don't have the sole tonight? –No, I'm afraid not. –What am I going to order then? –Well, just order something else. Did I tell you? We're moving to Italy. –Wow! Really! –To Italy? Estelle has always dreamed of living in Italy. I want to make her happy. I can't remember last time Gustaf and I travelled by ourselves. Would you like to order? –What's the halibut served with? –Shallots and spinach tossed in butter. Shallots is hard to digest and spinach gets stuck in my teeth. –Do you have mashed potatoes? –Of course. –The halibut with mashed potatoes, then. –The beef tenderloin, please. –How would you like your meat cooked? –Medium. –We'll have two foie gras, please. –Very good. Thank you. You dyed your hair? It looks great. –Thank you. –Have you dyed your hair? –Yes, two weeks ago. –Yes... Cheers! A toast for us getting together like this. And congratulations on your engagement. Do you have any idea what hair colour I had before I dyed it? Where in Italy are you planning to live? Down south, perhaps? – Do you even know the colour of my eyes? – Tuscany. It's so beautiful there. – Don't you think? – No, so you've no idea. –Gustaf bought support stockings. –It's for when I fly. –It's good for the circulation. –One wonders how old you are... –Let us drink now, shall we? –Yes, very good idea. A toast to all the wonderful years ahead of us. Cheers. You get a toast as well. I LOVE YOU Marianne. I'll take the long loop. –Gustaf, we need to talk. –Mm. I want a divorce. Sorry. Are you going somewhere? I don't love you anymore and I want a divorce. –But we have dinner plans. –What? Marianne? Are you serious? You can't just wake up on a Sunday morning and say you want a divorce. –Why not? –Because you just don't do that. –Really. –Marianne, please. Have you lost your mind? We have Sunday dinner at my parents'. –I have a taxi waiting. –Taxi? I'm so sorry, Gustaf. –Excuse me. –Yes. –What have I done? –Done? You can't think like that. This is all good. You shouldn't be sad now. You've talked of this for a long time. And now you've finally done it. I'm proud of you. This is the worst thing I've done in my whole life. –I want to throw up. –You know what we should do? –We should celebrate. –Celebrate...? Yes, you're very brave. You've taken charge of your own life. It's wonderful. –I'm a terrible person. –Stop it! Let's do this. You follow my lead for the next few weeks. So you get a chance to live a little. You can live here. – It's no mansion, but it will be fun. – Thanks. Here's an 82 vintage. I was thinking of saving it for my 40th birthday... –40? –Let's not talk about me. Let's toast to a woman who has given herself the chance – – to live life to its fullest. I'm so happy for you. Congratulations. Here. Isn't it good? "Congratulations", I'm not so sure... – Hello, dad. – Where is Marianne? She felt a little under the weather. But she sends her regards. Gustaf and the children are here. Marianne felt a little under the weather. Thank you, I'm not deaf! –Isn't Marianne feeling well? –Yes, she must have caught something. –I hope it's nothing serious. –No. Hi! –Hey, bro. –So... Where is Marianne? –Or did she leave you finally? –No. I'm going to shoot myself soon. Those are for everybody. That's enough. You damn little... My little darling. You're warm. Sweetie, are you not feeling well? –He's not all well that's for sure. –I think you're coming down with a cold. Well... you may call me old–fashioned for all you want. But traditions are important for a family's unity. Marriage can be quite challenging. Nils, you know what I'm talking about. Thank you, dad. And you, Inga... Well, we'll deal with you another time. Please Inga, don't be so darn sensitive. You can't give up too easily. You have to stay strong, hold on – – when the storm comes. Because, if there's love, there's... A toast to – – us celebrating our golden wedding anniversary in two weeks. –Cheers to love! –Cheers! –Please, bro...! –What was I thinking? Cheers. –Why did you say mom was sick? –So grandma and grandpa wouldn't be upset. –Why did you lie? –I didn't lie, she isn't feeling well. – But she's not sick. – She's definitely a little tired. –Are you getting a divorce? –Most definitely not. Not at all. Mom is just a little tired and needs a break. Then she'll come back and everything will normal again. Do you really believe that? –Ulrika street 11, please. –Ok. Wouldn't it be better if I just finished these? God, the dress fits you perfectly. You look great. –You need to get laid right away. –What? Get laid. You need to get out there right away. I'm still married. Hello, married! I'm at least not in any... to just get out there. Come on, you look hot. It will be a fun night. No, I absolutely cannot go out tonight. No way. –Doesn't anybody have a family? –Isn't great? These are so strong. What's in them? Well, hello there... –How are you? –Great to see you. –You still live in Mallorca? –Yes, of course. –You should visit sometime. –I just might do that. Ciao. Bye. He is such a creep. Anybody, but him. –Anybody but him what? –That you should sleep with tonight. –I'm not sleeping with anybody. –Come now! –I love this song! –Yes, it's really terrific. I'm not feeling so good. Hey! Hello. Hot. Ok... –No. I meant you're hot. –What? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought... ... you meant Camilla, so I ... –Relax. –Yes... I just got a little... Yes... Well. Ok, thank you. –Come on, let's get out of here. –What? Get out of here? –You and me. Come on. –No, we can't... –No, but really. –What was that? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. No, that's really not... I'm sure it will come out in the wash. –Just leave everything. –Get up! –How embarrassing, Camilla! –Don't be silly. Take my keys, I'll sleep at Roffe's tonight. –Roffe? Who is he? –My new boyfriend. Here. –What ever happened to... –Carl–Henrik? He was such a stiff. Listen, drink some water. Put your leg inside. –We'll talk in the morning. Yes, I know. –I had a wonderful time, Camilla! What should I tell the children? That their mother lost her mind? I'm sure they'll survive a few days with their father. Where are you staying? I'm staying at Camilla's place. Where else would I stay? –At Camilla's?! –Why can't you just listen to me? Stop acting like a kid! –Did Camilla put you up to this nonsense? –Don't you blame Camilla. She's been very considerate. You can't leave your family on an impulse. It's embarrassing. I'm leaving you. Not the children. You're just having a completely normal mid–life crisis. It will pass. I read that in the Financial Times. It sounds like you're talking about a dog being put to sleep. This is our marriage we're talking about. –Have you met somebody? –No, I have not. You should know me better than that! Oh, mother of God! Why did you hang up? What the hell are you doing? Filip? Are you insane? Hey, you... –Dad, this is my boyfriend. –Yes, hello. Gustaf Brandel. –Gurra. –What? Gurra. My friend's name is Gustaf, but we call him Gurra. Really? How nice. –So what's your name? –Fabbe. Or Fabian Love Wachtmeister, if you want to see ID, man. –You can't only drink chocolate milk. –I'm not hungry. –Have a sandwich at least, Filip. –Are you deaf? I'm not hungry! Really? How nice. –Did you have that made recently? –Yeah, shit, this one? I had it made the other day. –It comes from right here, man. –It's so incredibly honest. –It's important to be honest. –Right, dad? Oh yes, absolutely. Well? So... where do you go to school? I dropped out in high school. Listen, here's my philosophy: "School ain't for me." Life is my school, man. –Really? So you work then? –You could say that. –Nepal. –I beg your pardon? Dad, we've got to go. We're meeting some of Fabbe's friends. –Don't you have school? –No, we have field day. –Have a nice day, Gurra. See ya. –My name is Gustaf. Filip, take a banana with you. Emma, could you come back? –Isn't he the coolest? –Oh, yes... Could I have some money? Emma, I consider myself liberal... Fabbe wants me to go with him to Nepal. That's out of the question. No. –Thanks. –You're welcome. –And no tattoos! –No, I promise. Kisses. Bloody stoner...! Transfer? Are you firing me? We're simply moving the reconstruction group outside the city due to expansion. What am I to do in the suburbs? I have my gym membership here! What? We've always liked you. You're as close to partner as one can get. –Look at this as an opportunity. –I won't commute to some suburb! You've always talked about writing a novel. Take a sabbatical, give it a shot. Write a crime novel. They seem popular. A crime novel? Why not a cookbook while I'm at it? That's a brilliant idea. A cookbook for crime–novel lovers. I can picture the cover. Bloody, raw, a foggy meadow. What? Is this candid camera? Dick! I beg your pardon. No, this will be great. Really terrific. Think about it. –Can you make an express delivery... –Jezz, what the hell! –What are you looking at? –Nothing. I'm sorry. Yes, I'm on my way. God, will you relax. Hello? What, is it serious? –You work at that clinic uptown now? –Yes, I love it. –It's not for me. –The hours are great... –How is dad? –Alright. I'll see you. Come. What's the matter? You seem totally lost. –There's a lot going on at work. –Really. –How are you feeling? –Where is the doctor? That would be me. –Are you kidding me? –Anton, please... ! –Marianne wants a separation. –She left you? No, I didn't say that. She just wants a separation. –Please don't say anything to mom and dad. –Of course not. –He just trying to be funny. –I'll see that he gets some sedative. –Hello, how are you, dad? –What's with all this concern? –A slight overstrain, that's all. –Your father was lucky. It was a severe heart attack. He could have died. Where is Marianne? She left Gustaf. What are you saying? Has Marianne left you? –No, she just wants a little break. –Has Marianne left you? A little louder, dad, everybody on the ward might not have heard you. –Has Marianne left you? –Dad, just relax. Marianne wouldn't just up and leave. You must have done something? She hasn't left me. We're just having a trial separation. –Do you really believe that? –Yes. –Have you met somebody else? –Mom, please. –No, I have really not met anybody else. –Maybe she has. –Has Marianne met somebody else? –Nobody has met anybody! –Has Marianne... –You want to kill your poor father? In that case, you're very close in succeeding. Dad, get well. I need to get back to work. It's remarkable she hadn't left him earlier. Emma! Hi. –Who died? – Well... So... Your dad and I love you very much. You are our dearest – – and what I'm about to tell you has nothing to do with you ... –But you're getting a divorce. –No, nobody is getting a divorce. Right? –But mom just said so. –She didn't mean it like that. –Could you please let me handle this? –Yes, of course. –Dad and I are getting a divorce. –It's only a trial separation. –It's sad, but it will work out fine. –I knew it! Filip, darling, it will be... Filip, all will work out fine. You will hardly notice that mom and dad are divorced. Are we finished? Yes... I guess so. You don't have to worry, it will all be fine. We're not getting a divorce. It's just a phase mom is going through. Emma? Just a phase. She'll be back home soon again. That's the nature of things sometimes. Women are like that. I think. But we aren't getting a divorce for real? That's what other people do. What do you think we just talked about? Gustaf, you have to take this seriously. We will get a divorce! Hello, hello, how charming the courtyard has become, really. And what a magnificent day we've got. You're just going to leave like that? For me, a fabrication of our genders' sexual secularization. His vigour grabbed my lower abdomen. But there you are! Marianne, let me introduce Rodolfo, my boyfriend. Isn't he talented? – It's fantastic. – Sure. If you're blind or perverted... Just a little. He's originally from Sweden. They tried to get him to exhibit here for years, but it's been impossible. A woman. It's a little stuffy in here. –That's all for me. –Yes, let's see... You'll have to give that to someone else. I have a lecture this afternoon. Fucking idiot. Hi, you got an express package for me? –Stressful? –What? No, just that my boss is an idiot. –Big fan of reading. –Yes, I thought... It's for a friend. Who needs a little inspiration. A little? Quite a lot. "In Search of Lost Time", Proust. –I recognize you from somewhere, right? –Yes, we met briefly at my office. –You were a little stressed. –Yeah, damn right. –Thanks a lot. –Thanks. –Good luck now! –Thank you. With what exactly? –Your "friend's" inspiration. –Yes. Gaby, please listen. It's all very innocent. Why do you have my cell phone? I understand how that might sound. This patient just happens to have a very personal tone. I'm sorry if I'm disturbing. Aren't we going to play squash? Damn yes, of course we are. It happens sooner or later. People get married, they get divorced. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Don't tell me it came as a complete surprise? I thought she was happy. Or at least content. Who the hell is happy anyway? What's wrong with a little melancholy? Like Kierkegaard said: "My melancholy is the most faithful sweetheart I've had." –Do you stille sleep with each other? –Is that any business of yours? –We have a perfectly normal sex life. –So you're not screwing. Gustaf said: "I'm an immigrant too, I'm from the Upper East side." Honey, I don't mind change. If only things would ever get finished. I'm starting to like these plastic curtains. Like the plastic sheets! I think I'm going to wet my pants! Did you ever hear such crazy talk? Sten? Slut! Please excuse him, his wife just left him. That's it. I'll help you, bro. I no longer know that woman. She's not going to maneuver me out that easy. –Not that easy, she's not... –I'll help you. There we go. I've never heard anybody being allergic to Thyme. If you can be allergic to coriander, why not thyme? –How long have you been single? –Pardon? Well, I... It's a bit peculiar, it's very recent. I'm in the middle of divorce, you could say. –How about you? –Well, it's been about six months. I meet a lot of interesting people at the courses I attend. –How nice. What type of courses? –Well, all sorts. At the moment, I'm attending a course in Tantra sex. Tantra...? Isn't that, what is that? To reach a deeper connection – – and greater intimacy an openness is required. One has to undress both emotionally and mentally. At the moment, we're focusing on squirting orgasms. I'm sorry, may I ask you... Do you experience squirting orgasms? No. My orgasms are completely routine. It differs a lot of course. I don't either experience those kind. You have two ears and one mouth. You know why? Because you should listen twice as much as you speak. And what happens out here – – always starts in here. When you, Maria... – Marianne. – Become your inner leader. –I just got this terrible headache. –Of course. –Are all guys that desperate? –Desperate? You have to embrace a little. You can't be this negative. I'm not negative, Camilla. I'm just... –I should never have left Gustaf. –What was that? It's such a relief that I left Gustaf. Yes. Absolutely. If one cares for pathetic psychopaths... I'm sorry. I completely forgot. You speak Swedish. Really? Ok. No, I'm good. Yes, ok then. Ok. I don't know anybody here. This is all Camilla's idea, I'm simply here because... My husband and I are... Sort of, yes... Or what one might call it. My two favourite persons on my favourite terrace. You haven't been giving the hostess much attention lately. Well? What are you talking about? We just had a conversation about... This champagne. It's something special. Taste it. Come and dance. Come on! –Hi. –Hi. You seem like such a nice and sensitive person. Thank you. –We have lots in common. –We do? What have you heard? I can feel your pain. Here. Can you feel it? –I should call for a taxi. –No, I want you. Here and now. I have the keys to the laundry room. –Your husband. –Relax, he doesn't mind. Sten, go to bed. Go to bed! –No. No. –Yes. Yes. Yes. No, I can't. This is not acceptable. Are you on Facebook? No, but I've heard it's very popular. You should be ashamed of yourself! –I can't hear you. –I said, I love you. No. What? Really! You missed... I didn't say I loved you there. You know what? I'm not the least surprised. Egocentric artist type. And Italian. Please... –Didn't you think he was so nice? –I might have said something like that. Only goes to prove how wrong one can be. Or rather, how wrong I was. We even discussed getting engaged. Really? I see... I didn't know that. Engaged...? That was a bit hasty perhaps. I feel wasted. Like some rag. Give me a few more days. Yes, yes. It's ok. Come on, don't worry. Will you relax? Trust me. I have some problems with the family. Yes. I have to go now. Ciao, ciao. Thank you. Do you have any idea how Camilla is feeling? Do you? She's a wreck. A wreck. She's deeply upset. She is unhappy. I see. Excuse me. Let me tell you something. We typically don't practice this type of dishonest behaviour here in Sweden. You think you can behave any way you like. Simply because you're some... pussy– photographer, or whatever it is you do? I'm full. It was delicious. What's with all this... ... that you don't want to commit to anybody? Where did... You don't want to get hurt. That's it. Thank you. The bike is still there. Great. –Marianne. –Yes? I bet you would. No... Please, stop it... I really need to be on my way. Thanks so much. The risotto was terrific. And creamy... –Hello there! –Oh my god, you scared me! Hi. So you're awake. Great. –Did you get lucky tonight? –What? No, no. –I've been to a... museum. –At this hour? Well, it was more of a lecture, you could say. It was about... botany. Extremely interesting. –Did you have a glass of water? –Yes, in a second. This is Marianne. Hello, hello. –Hello, hello. –Hello, hello. What does...? Camilla, when did you two meet? I don't understand. You were devastated just earlier today. Yes, well... that passed. It passed. Really? Ok, well, that's just great. I barely make it out the door – – before you decide to drag home this whole man... Why aren't you wearing any clothes? I must say this is highly... Shame on you, Camilla! Shame! She got all upset? I resign. You resign? That's not what we discussed. I've decided to finally write the novel I've been talking about for so long. Pure, analogue, for real. You suggested it. I didn't mean for you to take me seriously. I don't want to intrude – – but I understand things have been a bit... strained at home? –I'm not going to jump from a bridge. –Well, that's a relief. Maybe from a skyscraper. I'm just kidding. Well, no point in me hanging around here any longer. I'll see you soon. Respect! Get out! Let's continue. What have I done?! Stressful? Oh, hello. What? No, no stress whatsoever... absolutely not... –You study to become a doctor? –Yes. You sound surprised? No, no, not at all, that's fine. My brother is a doctor. I recognized your book. Good for him. How are you? Bought any more books lately? No. I did, however, just resign. I've worked here 15 years, but I finally had enough. –How are you planning on celebrating? –No, I don't intend to celebrate. –Are you fucking stupid or what? –Excuse me? Of course you've got to celebrate. After 15 years locked up in this place. Yes, you have a point there. I should really celebrate. –Rita. –Gustaf. –Nice going there, Gustaf. –Thank you. –See you. –Yes... You have a... Gustaf! –Hello there, old chum! –Hello, hello. –How is everything with you? –Just great. How is... Italy? I hate that place. You can't sleep for all the cats – disgusting place. –I thought you were so happy. –We couldn't stop fighting. But we changed our minds and bought a marvellous penthouse in Paris. –Really? –Gustaf. If you don't have any plans Saturday night, I'm having a "moving out" party. –I see, how lovely. –Come celebrate that you're a free man. Yes, yes, free or free – we'll have to see about that... Thank you. –Text me if you want to come. –Yes, of course. Bye. –She studies to become a doctor. – I see? Well, well. That's a... fine profession. –Please send Marianne my regards. –Yes, of course. Send my regards as well. How lovely Paris sounds. Really lovely. "None of the brothers were mine. Hence ..." –Did you have a party? –No, absolutely not. –Do you smoke, dad? –Nope. –And where did you sleep last night? – At Fabbe's place. –What's up? –Hi, hello. I understand. Well... What's that you got in your nose, Emma? –Shit, an Olivetti. That's awesome retro. –So you recognize it, great. Yes, my grandpa had one. –When did you write this? –Before you were born. I never quite finished it. But now I'm on a roll. What publishing house are you with? –I haven't yet decided that. –Fabbe wrote this awesome hit Mangabook. I was with Forum publishing, but swapped to Pirate. I dig their 50/50 split. I see. How nice. Really. –"Jack". –Excuse me? "Jack", the cult novel. Have you read it? Yes! Of course. That was ages ago. So awesome, man. A classic. Right on, Gurra! Gustaf... That ring you've got in your nose. You'll have to take it out right away! –Come on, put some clothes on, dad. –What was that? Put some clothes on! Filip? Filip. You can't just leave like this. You've got me worried. You won't even answer your phone. I understand if you're upset, Filip. I really do. Filip... Please be quiet, Melker. I need to talk to Filip. Please, I'm... Shut up, Melker! Why do you get mad at him? He hasn't done anything. I'm just having difficulty concentrating when he goes on – I'm sorry. It's your fault mom left. No, that's not... Let go. Melker. It's not my fault mom left. Filip? And mom hasn't left. She's just taken a little break. –Idiot. –Excuse me? Oh my god. Bloody hell! Ah, fuck...! Shit. You little shit. –Mom, where is Inga? – At some "get–to–know–yourself"–retreat. Which seems so popular these days. Pure humbug, if you ask me. Here you are. –There. –Am I supposed to eat this? I'm not a rabbit? Have you seriously quit your job to write a novel? –Have you lost your mind? –Well... Yes, but... I'm not sure... You see... Maybe Filip could stay here for a few days, while I sort things out? –Only a few days, I promise. – I don't think that is a good idea. Your father is not well. And I've got a lot on my plate. The boy stays here. A home without a mother is no place for a young boy. Thanks, dad. Marianne is certainly not much of an example as a mother. Time for you to see your boss and apologize. –Dad, I've got things under control. –You must think of your reputation. A wife on the loose is not acceptable. My wife is not on the loose. I'm... it's... she... Hello? What is this? –Hi. –What's up? –What have you got in your nose, Emma? –It's a gift from Fabbe. Did dad give you permission to pierce yourself? You can't just do that. Mom, love doesn't need permission. Hi. –Shit, you're nice. –Oh? Thank you. Who is this guy? How old is he? Why aren't you in school? –We have a field day. –Today? –Isn't he magical? –Magical might be stretching it... We're going to Nepal. Fabbe knows this guru. Hold on, Emma, let's not get carried away. What is your dad up to? I've got no idea. I think he quit his job. –Quit his job? –I think so. Emma, we got to yoga! I love you, girl. I love you too. Emma, have you seen my large Vuitton suitcase? That imperialistic status symbol you value more than your children? Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Thanks, Emma. I'll find it. See you later. Bye, Fabbe. Bye–bye. Come on, Emma, Nepal! I mean, it's such a cliché. Gustaf is approaching 50. He wants a divorce. All of a sudden he got this idea that he's Strindberg. Yes, but he just quit his job. He's not going to work any more. You can't just behave like that. Life is for real. I'm so fed up with this facade. Pretending... That's not really me. I don't care. What I do care about is... ... being honest with myself. To be loved by someone who sees me for who I really am. I haven't had sex in several years! I'm having a relationship with Rodolfo. God, what a relief. I mean... I thought you had gotten cancer or something. –So you're ok with this? –God yes, I got over him ages ago. You scared me. I'm sorry, where were we? Ah, yes! Yes, those little pair of pendants... –Hi, sweetheart. Hi, honey. –Mom, what the hell are you doing? Dad's working on some ancient typewriter and Filip is at grandma and grandpa's. –You're not even around. –You know what? It's been a little hectic lately. I'm sorry. I will talk with dad. What about you, pumpkin? How are you? Are you and Fabbe doing ok? Don't you even try! You're such a worthless mom. You only think about yourself. Why did you even have kids if you didn't want to be with them? –Sweetie, you know what? –Oooh! Yes, it's all good. I should travel to Berlin? Ok... Are you sure this is the correct address? Ok. Have a good evening. Bye. Hello, hello. –Hi. I'm glad you texted me. –Yes. Hi. –Here you go. –Wow! Thanks. –Would you like beer? –Yes, please. –So you're moving out of here? –Yes. My moron landlord isn't too happy with me. Claims the neighbours complain. –That's a shame. –Yeah. It will work out. –I'll move in with you otherwise. –Yes! –He's jealous. –I see. How immature. I can't figure out why. We were just "FB". –What does "FB" mean again? –Fuck Buddies. Yes! Right. I knew that. –It can also mean Female Balance. –Yeah, right. –Great music. –Do you wanna dance? I'd love to. Makes you want to swing a little. –Shall we? –Yes. –Shit, really, a novel? –Yes. –How is that going then? –Really well as a matter of fact. I think I have a great draft, if I may brag a little. Cool. So you're a writer? That's great. I need to pee. Won't be long. Hi. Are you interested? –Are those actually drugs? –Are you a cop, or what? No, no. I just wondered if that... –Is it good drug quality, then? –Absolutely, it's good stuff. You would want to know that if you ever were to try them, I mean. You want some or not? Well... Strindberg was a writer just like me, and he drank absinth... I'll try one. What's the worst that could happen? I'm your best Fuck Buddy! You're up early. Hi, good morning. Here, in Stockholm? So your biological mother lives here... How did that go? Good. How nice. Rita? Rita? Hello? Hello. Hello. What a beautiful morning! Fantastic. The fall is the best season of all. Get out there and fill your lungs! Have a great day, Göran! See you! There you are! I've tried reaching you for days. They called from school. –What are you wearing? –I got these from our storage. They're mine. They want to discuss Filip. We have a meeting with the teacher. –What's the matter with you? You sick? –No, no, it's nothing. I thought we could go together. Emma told me you dug up your old typewriter. –And quit your job. –Yes. It's very liberating. I've started writing my novel. –What novel? –My novel. Hello. Hello. Camilla will be here. –Who's this? –This is Rodolfo. Rodolfo has made all these... It's been a great success. Sure, if one cares for such filth. –Sure. –Excuse me. She has? Ok. I see. And we're still married, for your information. So there. I also took some blurred photos when I was young, so we have two things in common. Blurred photographs and poking my wife. Poking my wife. –You got it? –Excuse me. Gustaf, come with me... –Regarding the meeting with the teacher... –Is he your "FB"? –What? –Fuck Buddy. Is that who he is? What are you talking about, Gustaf? Who I see or not is none of your business. Aha, that's my Fuck Buddy calling. Hi, Rita. Yes. No, thank you. Yes, of course. Meet for coffee at 3 o'clock. Great. –Sounds great. See you. Bye. –Who was that? Who I see or not is none of your business. –I'm going to kill him! –Please look straight ahead. –Ok, so what's her name? –What does she fancy with that gigolo? He's a pornographer. Who are you talking about? –Don't be an idiot. –I only care for Marianne. –I don't want anybody else. –Please take a deep breath. Good. Spit it out now, bro. – Rita. 29 years old. Medical student. –Awesome! I love Marianne. But Rita is so... What if one could have a "FB" on the side. –A "FB"? –Yes, it means Fuck Buddy. No, of course you can't. What am I thinking? It was so much fun, really fantastic. Maybe the best time actually. But Marianne is still Marianne, the mother of my children. Acute denial. I discovered things about myself that I had no idea existed. –Sexually stimulating substances. –What? –Ecstasy mixed with some other crap. –I knew it. I'm going to die! No, relax. Diagnosis... Jealousy and infatuation. You're obviously in love with this young woman. While still having feelings for Marianne. I feel pressure here. –Hi. –Hi. Was everything ok this morning? I had to leave for work. Yes, I managed. Some nice friends you've got. Rita, I could be your father. I know and I don't give a shit. Ok? I really like that you're so unpredictable and off. Yes... I'm a little crazy. I have a lecture later, but maybe we could have dinner tonight? Listen... I've got two teenage children. I've been saving for retirement since high school. I joined the Young Conservatives. I've got arch support in my shoes. I worry about my prostate. That's what I mean. It's hilarious hanging with you. Anything could come out of your mouth. That's nice. No Rita, I think you're a wonderful person in every way. But this relationship isn't going to work. I'm so – – messed up. I've got no job. I'm in the middle of divorce. I... I've experimented with drugs. I'm completely out of my mind. I'm so confused. I've no idea what to do. I'm just going at it. Someone should lock me up. I wasn't planning for us to get married. It's so complicated when you've been married for so long and have kids. I got it. No dinner tonight. You maybe want your underwear back. Take care. Sorry I'm late. Filip has had a lot of trouble concentrating. And he's had lots of absences recently. You can't even look after Filip for a few days. You're clueless. Filip is resting at my parents' house in the beautiful suburbs. His test scores have been dropping and he's behind in his work. –Things have been a bit strained at home? –Yes, you could say that. –We're getting a divorce. –We're just trial–separated. –It's just a matter of time. –You don't know that. We're not here to discuss the definition between divorce and separation, – – but to talk about your son. In the middle of all this, my ex–husband decides to quit his job. What exactly is it that you're doing? Working on some sort of novel? I can't believe it's true. He's a lawyer. Not a writer. Jens Lapidus, Juli Zeh. Fantastic writers and lawyers. I haven't at least made a fool of myself with some pathetic artist freak. –I have feelings for Rodolfo. –She doesn't mean that. Strong feelings. It wasn't anything I planned. It just happened. My wife has met a first–class idiot. I see but could we get back to talking about your son? Gustaf, you know what? You don't control your feelings. If there's something I control, it's my feelings. But I never thought you would fall for such a pornographer. I've slept with him. Lots and lots of times! You have to stop. You have to solve your relationship problems yourselves. Did you hear me, Gustaf? I've fucked him. Over and over again. It was great. I heard you. Thank you for telling me here and now. –Thanks a lot! That's very enlightening. –Good. So then you know. It's remarkable that your son turned out so normal. Thank you. He shows his feelings and he makes me feel appreciated. –Oh, the sensitive type. –You're incapable of change. –What the hell are you wearing? –You should talk. What's that?! –Are you going for a public radio–look? –Public radio, what are you talking about? You used to care about how you looked. Don't play so damned innocent! I've seen you with your "girlfriend". You've been spying? I might take that as a compliment. Don't flatter yourself, it was a pure coincidence. Rita is almost 30 years old and a sophomore medical student. Oh my, how cute. Then you've had time to play "doctor". Perverse is what it is! You know that? That is one damn ugly beret. Damn ugly beret! I'm so grateful you've let me stay here. Thank you. Yes, see you. Great, bye–bye. –But, sweetheart. –Mom! He said he didn't love me any longer. That he'd met someone else. If I hadn't been this ordinary and boring this would never had happened. Emma, stop it. You are the sweetest in the whole world. Of course you think that. You're my mom. Darling. You will meet plenty of – – other guys. I promise. I understand that it hurts now, but it will all work out. No, I will never meet anybody as great as Fabbe. –Don't say that. –What? No, I just... –Sweetheart... –I hate Nepal! Why did you leave dad? My sweet... – Great! I'm so glad you could make it. –I can't stay very long. Marianne, I believe we're worth a second chance. Or a try at least. What do you think? –Gustaf, we're in the middle of a divorce. –Yes, I'm aware of that. That doesn't mean one can't change one's mind. –Perhaps you would like to order? –I'll have a mineral water, thanks. –Aren't you going to eat something? –No. I'm on a diet. There's no need for that. I think you look great... as you are. –You do? –Yes, like a little cake. –Alright... –Really... What are we doing? –Really? –You don't feel the meeting went well? Yes, that went really well. One could say. If we didn't get him expelled, I don't know what we have to do. No, please...! How long did you plan on having him stay at your parents' house? –I'll come to that now. –No, I had ordered a mineral water. –Yes, but this is what I brought. –Yes. Thank you. Marianne, I would like to apologize. I've been acting like an idiot. I can't speak on your behalf, but I'm not proud of – – these "performances", over the past few weeks, or whatever one might call them. I've always imagined us growing old together. I know things haven't been good these last weeks – – or years even perhaps, but... I miss you. The children miss you. And it's empty without you. A toast. It's me, I'm really sorry that... Just drop everything. It would never... Yes, exactly. Another time perhaps... Yes. It's... I hope that it works out. Ok. Ok. I'm not very... I'm really lousy saying it. You look great, Marianne. Really. That dress fits you so well. Thank you. There's a little something for you in the kitchen. –For me? –Yes. But sweetheart, haven't you changed yet? We're about to leave. –Mom, what are you guys up to? –We're going to grandma and grandpa's. Are we supposed to act like one happy family all of a sudden? –Emma, please. –No, it's so false, mom. I feel we all have to help out a little here. You are so pathetic. It's digusting! Yes. Sort of like in the good old days. I see, thank you. Gustaf, we don't have time, maybe you should... Tell Emma she needs to change and I'll call for a taxi. I already pre–arranged for one. Emma! –So, let's see now... There. –Are you coming, sweetheart? –It turned out nice. –Let's hurry up now. –Are you sure about this? –Yes, you are excpected. Well, good. Time for dad to make a speech. My dear family, my beloved wife, my beautiful Clara. Thanks for putting up with me all these years. Believe it or not – – but on this very day 50 years ago we got married. Let's not get carried away now, thank you. –I'll get it, dad. –Are we expecting anybody? I see...? Mom, I think you are receiving a flower and singing telegram, I think. Did you invite him? Why would I invite him? What are you doing here, Rodolfo? Mom, do you know this man? I've never seen this person in my whole life. Weren't you supposed to sing? You think I'm a complete idiot. I know exactly what you're up to. –Gustaf, what are you doing? –Now wait. Calm down, Gustaf. No, no, no, no. –Don't do anything stupid now. –You get your hands off my wife! –Fucking hell! –Damn you, Gustaf! What are you yelling at me for? Mom! More! Have you lost your mind? Are you trying to kill your own brother? What? I knew it. Please try and behave now, so I won't have to see you here again. Happy wedding anniversary. The summer before I meet your father... I had an affair with a young man. An Italian. He was... He was an exchange student. We fell madly in love. I was just a young girl. What experience did I have of life? Of taking care of a child. So I told Anton everything. And he accepted. Because he loved me. Anton took care of all the arrangements. Such as the adoption. I've been a coward! I didn't have the courage to present you to the family. It was unforgivable of me. Come. Nice going...! –Marianne! – Gustaf please, I can't take any more. But Marianne, things got a little messed up. But you shouldn't feel embarrassed. No shame on you. Shame? You're the one acting like a complete idiot at dinner. Yes, but that was all a misunderstanding. Anyhow, I forgive you. You forgive me. How charming. If anybody should apologize, it should be you. –I had no idea he was your brother. –Brother? I'm not sure about that. He's maybe some distant relative. What was I thinking? Marianne, you can't leave. We must be able to talk. I understand if you're upset, but... I'm upset as well, Marianne. Hey, you. Are you going home now? Where are you going? 3 MONTHS LATER Here you go. "Delusions", by Hjalmar Söderberg. Please. –Excellent. Thank you very much. –You're welcome. Pleasant reading. –See you soon. –Yes, welcome back. –Hi. –Hi. –I'm sorry I'm late. –Don't worry. Having your own shop is a lot of work, you know. –Did you cut your hair? –No. –Gustaf... –I went too far. I said and did things I deeply regret. It was nobody's fault, Gustaf. It's all just a bizarre coincidence. Yes, you can say that for sure. Before I came here, I took a long walk and thought about – – us and how incredibly lucky it was that we met – – and that we brought Emma and Filip into the world... I never intended to hurt you, Gustaf. No. Marianne, you don't need to explain yourself. Yes, I do. I haven't been completely honest with you. –It was not your fault. –Marianne. I'm as much part of this as you are. Once I could let go, I felt for the first time in my life – that I wanted to be alone. And I want you to know – – that you don't need to worry about me. I'll be fine. Yes, I never doubted that. I've never doubted that. Right... I almost forgot these. Yes. –So, then it's your turn. –And just my signature here? Yes. Listen... No matter what we do it will still feel like a failure. –That's just how it is. –But it's no failure. –No, it's not. –What is it then? –It's what it is. –It's what it is. Hello? –Hi, guys. –Hey, man. –Emma. –Hello. –Hi, mom and dad. –Hi, bro, this is Miriam. –Hello, Miriam. –You met at the hospital. Yes, right. Hi, how nice. –Sister. –Hi, Marianne. –I heard you're going to Berlin. –Yes. Rodolfo asked me if I wanted to join him – – and help out with his exhibition, so I said yes. That sounds great. It works for my part. –I mean with the kids. –That's great. –Hi, dad. –Hi, buddy. This song. I've just got to... –Who is "FB"? –It's nobody special. Yes, come on? Yes, she might be a little special. Or very special. Fantastico! Thanks.
