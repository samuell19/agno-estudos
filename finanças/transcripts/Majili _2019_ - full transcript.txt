The both Bullaiah college and Isukathota teams are beats on their opposite teams, and entered into the finals. [vehicle arriving] [indistinct voices] -Hey, Paidi, brother has come.-The prize money is 5000 rupees -and the cup... -Hey, Bhushan brother came. Welcome to the Chief guest, our Corporator Mr. Bhushan who is here to watch the final match. Who are our people in this? Hey Satya... Come here. -Brother, he is Isukathota Captain. -Greetings, brother. Hey! If you lose, it is equal to brother's loss. Why do you say so, bro? We defeated six teams and can't we defeat one team? We will win the cup and bring fame to Bhushan brother's name. What dude, you committed so with Bhushan? They won six matches, onto that they are college students and are in form. We have Purna with us. -Why did that Purna come here? -I too don't understand the same brother. Brother, it seems Satya has done match-fixing with Purna. Brother, he's our rival. Still, we know that but he isn't aware. You enjoy the match. Yes, Brother. Why did you wear a shirt when I asked you to wear a T-shirt? Have you called me for umpiring or for a fashion show? Huh! Ok. Give the coin and go for tossing. Isukathota team won the toss and elected to bat. [cheering] Bullaiah college team bowler Deepak opened the bowling. Isukathota captain Satya is batting. -Bowling dude... Bowling...-We can understand how strong... ...are the Bullaiah College team right with the first ball. -Nice bowling... Nice bowling.-Isukathota captain Satya... ...is struggling in Deepak's bowling. [indistinct voices] -Out. -Umpire? -They've appealed for run out. -Damn! -Satya escaped a run-out and took a run. -Purna started the match-fixing bro. -The team opened their account. -Purna, bowling is very tough. You should do something. -Come to the front foot and play. -What if I get out? Are you the umpire or me? -You. -I'll take care of it. Ajay is bowling second over. -Satya is clean bowled. -Out... Out... Bullaiah College is overwhelmed as Satya is out. -But umpire Purna gives no ball. -Hey... Not out. Bro, he was not given out again. [cheering]Satya hits a four on off side. Out. [cheering] Isukathota team lost their first wicket. We're getting caught to the leg when we're coming onto the front foot and playing. He just has a leg in his hands. I'll have the whole body in my hands. Um... Okay. Don't cross the crease and play on back foot. [whistling] Damn! Ten Overs... Two wickets... 85 runs. Out empire... Out empire... [indistinct voices] Not out. They're playing a wrong game by fixing with the umpire, shall we give a walkout? Come on, let's not give up. Come on boys. Isukathota team beat 152 runs from 20 overs. Bullaiah college team target 153. Bro, he'll get to know after the match that he supported our boys. That Purna will die in shame. Purna, we felt can't hit even 50 runs but you made us hit 150. Make that team all out within 10 overs. And we'll party. The captain of the bullaiah college team is batting. Ball... Ball... Ball... He made one run. Captain. [applauds] You play your game. You'll win this game. Go play. Rajesh is bowling. Kiran hit the shot. [applauds] It's six. Bullaiah college team is playing steady right. Batsman is making the scoreboard run with regular fours and sixers. Purna, why are you so silent without giving outs? The public came to know that we both fixed up and are playing the cheating game Let's leave them for five overs. Just five overs, right? Let's leave. Okay boys, come on... Come on. Bullaiah College batsmen are playing great. They haven't lost a wicket yet. [whistling] [cheering] Bullaiah College team scored 136 runs in... -...15 overs without losing a wicket. -Purna. Talk is still the same and what shall I do? I'll take care in the 5 overs. Both the openers in a good form, are chasing the target by hitting fours and sixes. Bullaiah College team without losing any wicket, achieved the target easily and won the tournament. Hey, you take money from us and support them? [indistinct voices] How much did you take from them? I'll say to Bhushan brother and you... Who the hell are you rascal, saying umpire to cheat? Huh! Management! Brother, he looks like an idiot. He suddenly changed the party. Bro, what bro? You supported them first and suddenly came to our side? Those Isukathota idiots bribed umpires all in the tournament and came to finals. Such waste idiots shouldn't win over sincere players like you. Thus I entered from their side and made you win. Bro! As you made us win, I wish to give you a small party. You are students, right? You may not have money, it's ok. No problem bro, say what do you want? Will you book a room in Taj hotel? "No way for the sensitive jasmines to reach your topknot" "Cuckoo hasn't sung with you..." "...when the day is going down" "Come to me, by crossing over the high tides..." "...my dear" "Sleep forgetting this nightmare..."

Watch it... -Super. -I can't. -Hey... hey, where are you going? -I'll go pee and come. Hey! If you move anywhere till Sachin hits a century, I'll kill you. What's the link between Sachin to hit a Century and me going to pee? -Hey! -There is a link. Tell him what happened day before in Australia match. -He messed the wide ball and got out. -Yes! It's all because of you, idiot! I'll prove that your sentiments are completely wrong. -Hey... Don't go. Please sit. -Hey wait... Please wait a minute. -Don't go. -Wait. -Shucks! -Oh God!

[door creaks] Hey, why for you? What if something unexpected happens? Let him do Sir. Your son is Electrical in ITI, right? You'll understand on the spot about what he studied. Hey, we should bash up Murari by blindfolding him. [indistinct voice] Hello, Mr.Purna... Better do prayers to your dearest God. No idea whether we can see you again or not. Dear, what are you talking? You don't know. Do you know how he talks from the morning? He's the most useless fellow of this entire colony. -Oh God! The power is back. -His face has become black.

Your son is smoking and boozing. -Oh, is it? -Yes. -Ok, leave it sir. -What is to leave? Sir, if he learns that I got to know about his boozing, he would continue it before me. It would be disgusting. Sir, we should carefully safeguard the fear of being the father. Sir, please don't tell him that I got to know. Will there be a father as such too? [vehicle leaving] Irresponsible father, idiot son. What did you say is your name? Kanakaraju. He did Fitter in ITI and stopped, brother. Srinu said that you would get him a job in Railways. Why did you tell him so late? This year's railway posts are already out. Onto that, we should manage from lower authority to the higher authority. The boy seems to work genuinely hard. We shall spend money, brother. It may cost up to three lakhs. I can pay up to two lakhs, brother. Oh, you wanted me to bear that extra one lakh. Right? When you find a good person, you'd exploit him. -Ok, I'll go to Bhubaneswar in two days. -Okay, brother. -I'll talk to all and come. -Okay, brother. -Give that two lakhs to our guy. -Okay. -I'll give the money, brother. -Ok, sit... Hey, sit. Brother, your job is guarantee now. -Hey Ganesh. -Brother. Are the boys ready for MP brother's rally tomorrow at the RK beach? Everything fine brother but that Railway new colony boys are denying to come. Why? That coach Srinu is diverting the boys by saying that there are railways placements. Distribute the cricket kits and biryanis. Let's join everyone. -Okay, brother -Did you understand? Our MP brother would feel bad if he gets to know about this. Shouldn't I talk on your behalf and arrange jobs for you? -Okay. -Then? Ok, manage carefully. Okay brother. -I'm leaving then. -Okay. What guys? It seems that you and colony team fought in the Waltair ground? Brother, I was saying not to play the match with them. Brother, it was that Ganesh who cheated us for every ball. -Thus we revolted on them. -Shut up! Why do you want to play cricket with those goons? [indistinct shouting] Don't you wish to play for the Railway's team? Selection trials are starting. In few days, there are district league and zonal matches. If you play well and get selected for the East Coast, you'll get a railway job and place in Indian Railways Cricket team at the same time. You are saying a lengthy process. There is a word outside that the job can be achieved by paying three lakh rupees. Who, who is saying so? Is it that Bhushan? He's collecting money from public and is doing prostitution in Bezawada lodge. Work will be done it seems! Sorry brother, we won't play with them again. Ok. The day after, we have a match with Navy team in the interservice competition. It's a strong team, practice well. Go -Let's go. -Phani. -Brother. -For the day after tomorrow's match... Shabaresh isn't coming, right? No problem, brother, we have another good player. -Ok, you take care of it. -Okay, brother. -Brother. -What? I wanted to take training from you for this year's Railway team selections. Oh, already so many players are here. -Brother please, I play very well. -If needed, ask in Church ground. If he hits, everything is six and four. We shall see next time. You still have age, right? Please brother, you said the same even in the last year. Do something and give me a chance. -I'm helpless, next year. -Brother... Brother, please... -What is this? -What? Do you want to play the match against the Navy team on the day after tomorrow? Yes bro, yes. The captain is our guy. I'll suggest you and he'll join you in the team. - Many thanks bro, thanks. -Arrange for Rs. 2,000. Give me if you wish to play, otherwise no. Let's meet tomorrow. Rs. 2,000? I doubted when I saw his face. Do they take bribes here too? Purna, what are we doing in the early morning? It's time for the big ship to come. Guards will be high in number. Is this huge risk needed for just 2000 bucks? Hey, are we looting the ships? Just some Copper and some Sulfur. But, we can do anything for cricket. We can do anything for friendship. We can do anything if it comes for free. -Idiot! -It's okay. Hey... Hey... -What are in these sacks. Hey, it's copper. Hey, hold it. Hey, stop it. What is this Sulfur and baking Soda? We should aim for high. Hey, what's your nonsense? Keep calm. Shall we break the container? -Hey! -Have you gone mad? It'll be a big case. Mr. Jonty, there won't be a success unless you take the risk in your life. Listen to me guys, just one shot and all four of us can settle down. -Hmm. -Hmm. [metal clunks] -It has opened. -What must be inside? Hey, slowly... Slowly... Hey, wait dude. -What did your dad say recently? -What did he say? You are settled by tomorrow morning and your dad goes silent. -Hold it, dude. -Okay, give it. Move aside. Mine is a lucky hand. -Slowly. -Open man, open it. It's on me. Why is it so empty, dude? What did you say? I'll get settled and my father will be silent? What did you say? [indistinct voices] It is not a mistake to kick you for what you've done. -Hit him guys, hit him. -Ouch! Let's lock him in this container today. -Hit him dude, hit him -Hey! Whose is that? They are cops. Let's go. Hey Jonty, pick the copper fast. -Make it fast. -Pick them fast. We will be finished if we get caught to him. Runaway, guys. Hey Masthan, take this. -Hey! Hey! -Hey! Hey, stop. Who is it? What did you steal? Stop. Hey stop, stop. Have you seen any person coming to this side? No. [footsteps leaving] Hey... Hey wait. -Did you click my pictures? -No. -Tell the truth, did you click my photos? -Why will I click your photo? Show me. Are you Shahrukh khan? -Give the camera, give the camera. -No. I'm asking you to give the camera. Give it to me. Give the camera. -Hey, give it to me... Give it. -Hey! Leave me...

Hey... -Give me my camera. -Leave me. -Get lost! -Idiot! Hello. Hey! You dirty fool. -Hey, get lost. -Police. Thief is running away taking my camera, catch him. [birds chirping] Anshu, how are you so easily saying to have lost the camera? -Why did you go to the harbour? -It's just a camera, mom. Why are you shouting at me? [weeping] I brought the camera from the US with love for her birthday. She doesn't even have a bit of concern Reetu. -Sanjana, there is nothing like that. -So... ...did I ask you to celebrate my birthday? Did I ask to get a camera for me? Shut up, Anshu. Don't take people for granted. Okay? -Mom, she is taking me for granted. -No, she is not taking you for granted. Anshu. Stop being rude to my mom. She is getting hurt. Go to hell. [weeping] I'm so sorry, Sanjana. Look, what your dear daughter has done. What, didn't she have breakfast? It's not about the breakfast. It's about Sanjana's camera. She lost the camera and now she is insulting her. She is behaving so now. Will she obey her after getting married to Kunal? Look, she is standing there. Make her understand about how to treat people. What happened dear? Dad, this Sanjana aunty is irritating. No, you shouldn't say so. -Did you start? -They are our well-wishers. Anshu, you are a Navy officer's daughter. People will look up to you. Right? You should be aware of what to talk, how you behave and what you do. -The world sails on... -Discipline. Right. Go, have your breakfast. Madhu. -Sir. -Discipline! How are Anshu's birthday party preparations going? [music] Huh! [train moving] Jontey... Jontey... Jontey... Oh no! [cheering] 180 runs it sees dude, can we hit? We can if there's a partnership. What kind of bowling is that guys? Have you guys scared by seeing those navy players? Brother, we have our batting too, right? Brother, we'll show then what our Railway team is. Fifty should be there in the first five overs. Brother, I think it will be better if we have 70. I mean it would be better if we hit the new ball before it is worn off. Hey, shut up. Let's bowl out their entire team in ten overs, okay? -Okay. -Come on boys, let's do it. [whistling] [cheering] -Hey... Kishore come... -Ball.. ball...ball.. ball... -Come on, run...

The overs are finishing. Yes, bowling is very tough. It gets loosen if two shots are hit. They are playing too soft, coach. Out, out. -Siva, you go. -Shall I play? He can't play in their bowling, coach. Ok, pad up. Thank you coach, thank you. Boys, come on. Try it. We'll anyways lose the match. I'll make a half century. Take single and give me a strike, okay? Why centuries when our team doesn't win bro? 86 for 6 overs isn't a big deal. We can hit if we both decide. What to decide? Don't overact and take a single. If not, you won't be there in the next match. Huh! -Hey, give the ball. -Hey, come... -Come. -Go, go. Wait... he will play. Didn't I told you that we'll lose the match? Hey, wait...

Actually, I should break your limbs for what you've done. Do you need my limbs or the camera? I need my camera. I gave it to your security, take it. Wounds aren't any new to me. But I will remember this for a lifetime. Excuse me. Did anyone give you a camera? Yes, madam. Here it is madam. A boy came in the morning and gave. Anshu dear, is everything is fine? -Everything is fine, uncle, thank you. -Ok, take care. Where are you going? -To Jonty's house for combined studies. -Oh, you study too? Turn this side. What's that?

You are overtaking my brother it seems? -Me? -You aren't listening to him, it seems? -What are you blabbering? -Didn't you take away my opener place? Hey, I was just obeying the coach. That means, won't you obey the Captain's order? What kind of captain are you? You are talking only one-sided. Why are you talking too much? We'll have so many things in our team, who are you in between? -He is my own brother. -You hit my brother, get lost! -How dare you to hit my brother? -Will you hit me? -Hey, Chalapathi. -Will you hit me?

Not just this match, but I won't play any match if that fellow is there. See bro, how arrogant is he talking. Not just me bro, but all our guys are hurt. Ask Phani if needed. What man? Yes bro, it seems he's saying all even at the park center. He said we won't win even one match if he is not there in the team. -Hey, who said it? -Hey! -Why are you both playing tricks? -Brother, why will he say so? -Tell me who said so? Tell me. -Did you say like that? I didn't say bro but I'm saying now. -This team is wins just because of me. -Ok, you don't need to play for this team.

Why is he doubting on me by leaving the one who committed the mistake? -Come on Jonty, let's leave. -Hey... Hey... It's a small fight dude. Why are you make this big? Small fight? It's me who was insulted and I will only have the pain. Hey Purna. Purna, Paidi said it all. It's their luck that you are playing for the new colony team. Of course. If he wasn't there in the recent Waltair tournament, they'd have lost the second match. When Purna plays is any team, they will definitley win. Let's make the whole Vizag know about this. You don't play for free. You are very young. I'll pay you per every match. Play for the team I say from next time. You know Bhushan brother, right? He's gone out, I will introduce you once he's back.

Ganesh, I don't feel this to be correct. Hey, you don't think otherwise. [indistinct voices] All the great players have come up like this. Don't mind them. Give me your hand. Have this. Go on. Don't swallow, hold it here. See now, all of your focus will be just on the ball. [applauding] Purna... Purna... Purna... [whistling] -You are super, dude. -Thanks Ganesh.

Is the sister happy? What is she saying? Nothing, she says that she need some private space. Oh God! Did she say private space? Oh no, she says to take her to room dude. Hey! No, no. she isn't of that type. She is a north indian girl dude. They wish to check thoroughly. They will get ready for the wedding once they agree for everything. Hey, if you hesitate now, she won't see your face again. How can arrange a room suddenly? Hey, tomorrow is Sunday. There'd be no one here in the party office. You and sister sit here alone and talk happily. -Hey, Paidiraju. -Yes. Give that office keys to Purna. -Alright. -Okay, then. -See you. -Thank you Ganesh. Don't ask for medicines once again without a prescription. Okay sir. What, what do you want? I need that. What is that? The one which is used as a precaution before that. I want that. Before what? Precaution for what? Helmet, man. It's the helmet for the safety. Why do you need my helmet, man? Oh God! How should I explain it to him? I need a condom. You asked so easily as if it is a chocolate. Shh! What is your age and what is your requirement? What do you mean? Do you want me to wait until I'm your age? -Wait, I'll tell to your father. -Don't tell to my father. [phone beeping] No, no. Don't tell him. -It'll be a problem if he learn about it. -What if he knows? Sir! You know, your son came to my shop and asked for a condom. If he knows that I know, then tomorrow in front of me... No need, it's waste. -Will you give or not? -I won't give you. I won't encourage antisocial elements like you. Get out! Do you think that it's just your medical shop in Gnanapuram? I'll go to another shop. Get lost! Poor girl, no idea whose life is this idiot ruining today. -Anshu, is this okay? -Ok. Tv playing: "Lag Jaa Gale song from the film Woh Kaun Thi" Singing: "Lag Jaa Gale song from the film Woh Kaun Thi" Purna! Do you know what this means? No, I don't know. So, this means, On this beautiful breezy night, let's hug each other. As we might not get a moment like this for our life time. -For our life time, we might not... -I don't even know English too. Learn. And teach me Telugu properly. Alright learn it, learn. You know, I know palm reading. -Oh! -Show me your hand. So, this is the marriage line. -This is the love line. -Oh! And this is the children line, it's the kids line, okay? The marriage and love line are meeting very fast, Purna. And regarding the kids line, I think you should take it very easy. I think it should take it slow and you should enjoy... What are you doing? You only ask for it, right? So, it is for the safety for whatever we do. Shut up, when did I ask? -You asked for a private space. -What? This one? I mean, my friend said that, all North India girls would check before marriage. So, that's why... Oh my God Purna! How can you guys be so cheap. Any girl whether she is a North India or a South India, she will give everything once she trust you completely. There will be no checkings and no need of even this. Sorry. I don't like what you did, Purna. Do you want it now? Whatever we do, it is after marriage. [door knocking] -Hey Ganesh, whats up? -Are you happy? Sister... Bhushan brother has come, dude Is it? Ok, we'll leave. You go, the girl will be here. What are you talking? Brother has never asked me for anything. For the first time, he got feelings for a girl.

The time won't be sufficient if I start narrate it to you. How did these things come to you? My name is Bhushan, madam. I'm the youth President of Gnanapuram. Nowadays, your daughter is roaming around with a boy named Purna, do you know that? Don't know. He trapped her by with his alluring words. She had been to a room with him yesterday. She forgot this bag in that room. There's a gang in Gnanapuram to trap the daughters of officers like you coming from other states. He is one of the gang members. If something unexpected happens to your daughter, your family will get ruined We can buy many bags if they are lost. But what can we do if lives get ruined? Ok sir, take care. See you. See you, Madam. What is this Rajeev? Anshu... Where did you forget these things? I had been to Kunal's friend's house to get records. -I must have forgot... -Huh! Leave it.

Get up Hey, wait. Hey! will you die? Is she more valuble than your life? You used to call her as sister, right? Would you do the same even for your sister? Rather than their bashing me up, I feel more painful for what you have done to me. What kind of friend are you? Damn you! -"No way for the sensitive jasmines" -Stop there... -"to reach your hair" -Anshu... Leave me. Leave me. Anshu... Anshu... Leave me. Anshu... -"Cuckoo hasn't sung with you" -Leave me.

Where will you go? Will you abandon cricket and all your dreams? What are you talking, Anshu? What are you talking? At one point, you'll question whether you're important to me. And again, you'd question whether cricket is important to me. Have you gone mad? Yes, I'm mad Purna. I am mad because I love you Because I care about you. Do you think this is a joke? You are not understanding. Purna... They'll kill you. I'm coming tomorrow evening, right? We will decide. We will decide about where we will have to go, what we will have to do. Please maaya(dear)...

What's that Mr Bhushan? What is with your boys and what kind of fights are they getting into? Greetings, brother. It's petty fight in the cricket ground in the morning, SI sir. It doesn't mean you should mess with ladies, right? Ladies? What guys, what happened? It wasn't us who teased, brother. Some mistake has happened somewhere, SI sir. My boys generally never do such things. Look at him... That guy is very dangerous. He says to know all guys in Cricket and keep taking money from everyone. No sir, he is not such kind. Do you know how many guys were cheated by him? -He stays in his own world, -Hey! -but he never messes with anyone. -Hey! Look how stubborn he is... -How reckless he is! -Who ruined the lives? -Please, calm down. -He doesn't even care about you. -Calm down... -Hey, stop What is this sir, will he hit and kill if somebody touches his girlfriend? Sir, he might let go if she was his girlfriend, but she's his wife whom he married by taking oaths to protect her. Then, ask her to give a complaint herself. I file the FIR. Where is she? [rainfall] Your name? Sravani Is he your husband? Are these the guys whom misbehaved with you? -Throw properly. -She's shining like tender brinjal. -Why don't you accept? -Sravani... Come on... Yes, sir. Look, they'll be punished for a month if you file a harassement complaint against them. And also, your husband will be in one day remand for taking law into his hands. It means he has to be in the jail for a day. Speak what shall we do? Complaint or compromise? Compromise Good! You can leave now. Mr Bhushan, if this repeats again, I'll put them behind the bars. Leave! [birds chirping] -Oh hot, hot... -Father-in-law... Pesarattu(pancake made from Mung bean batter) for him and I'll make Dosa for you Oh.. Pesarattu for him and dosa for me? For you... I don't need. You don't need her, but you want the breakfast prepared by her. It's been 2 years since you got married. Did you ever speak to her with love? She wanted to take you temple as it was your marriage day, but you took her to the Police station. -It was because of me. -That's not the case. Your husband didn't hit them with love on you It's just a reason for him to show up his heroism What do you do this when he's eating, father-in-law? Sir is available only while eating, right? When can we get him otherwise? [knocks] I need to talk with my daughter for 10 minutes. Didn't you have your breakfast? There's nothing here Hey... Dear, bring breakfast for your father. No need, dear. Mr Jagannatham, I thought no girl in this colony should get married to your son. But, my bad luck. I never even dreamt that I'll have to give my daughter with my own hands to marry him. I came to know that an idiot without any goal is there in the opposite house but never thought that my daughter will like the same guy. Dear Sravani, your husband crossed the stages of drinking, fighting and went till Police cases means, the next stage would be going to prision. Why do you want to bear that? Listen to me, let's to our house. -[coughs] -Come with me, dear. She is coming. Can't you understand? Our daughter is asking us to get out of the house. Come on, let's go We got to give new clothes for our son-in-law for this Pongal festival. If you give money to our daughter... You know what he does with that money? He'll will go to Kondal Rao bar and booze for 4 days continuously sitting at the same place. Will you give? Let's go. We shall have some self respect. Let's come on next Sunday. It is common for us, right? -Shekar [typing] -Madam Didn't you get service done for the printer? I'll get it done, madam. When, after all those passengers miss their train? Sorry, get your tickets in the next counter. Look at her, she doesn't say a word to her husband who doesn't even earn. But she yells at us. Usual thing, right? -Yes. It's just her stupid projection. -Yes. What did you say? Nothing. Your husband works in Wipro, right? Salary is 50,000 rupees but gives just 10, 000 rupees at home. Shall I say the balance account? One set up at Akkaya palem and another set up at Tadichetla Palem. Gives 20 here and 20 there. He's playing 20-20 match. Everyone in the office other than you knows this matter. Don't mess with my personal matters Not that Sravani... Don't mess with me! [indistinct train honking] Sir I checked all the ledgers of last month. You always talk of duty and job, but never think about the pleasures of life Be seated. -Now, tell me. -How is your health, sir? All of you thought that I took leave last week due to health issues, right? Yes Uh-uh, I lied. I went to honeymoon with your aunty. Honeymoon at this age, sir? What else can I do, dear? Marriage, job and then it was done with children's education and marriages. That's why, we've sent them far away and I and your aunty went for honeymoon. Where did you go for honeymoon? Ours was a destination wedding, We started from Goa... And till Munnar... Manali, Kashmir All... We covered everything On top of that, he likes snowy places. -Is it? -Yes. What the heck of IPL is this, man? During our time, we couldn't eat for three days when India loses. And now we are all clapping when some outside guy is hitting a six. It's become a hybrid cricket. [phone rings] Yes, brother Okay, brother. Okay. It was Srinu brother from Dehradun. He called again. He asked me to come to Dehradun if I'm free. Oho! Where the hell are we free? There's a lot of things here to finish. -Greetings, Bhushan brother. -Greetings. Be seated. Hey, Bhushan is coming. Don't look at him Purna, why are you drinking so much? Your kidneys and liver would get spoiled. Somebody advise him, guys -[laughs] -Yes, brother Hey, ask him to leave from here. -Mr Bhushan, this isn't correct. -Please leave Hey, I'm saying for the benefit of his health. You sit... How if somebody don't tell? Hey, he's such a good player. I thought he'd become a national player. Why like this, dude? We used to happily bet over him. What can he play now, bro? -What can he play now, bro? -[laughs] Pity his wife, what might be her situation? Huh! -You rascal! -Hey... Hey... Hey... Hey! Hey, I remember her seeing you. When I remember her, I forget I'm a human. Then I don't know what I do. -Hey please dude, go from here. -Hey... -Go from here -Hey... Hey... It's his emotion guys, his love. Don't hurt Hey, you sit down. I said to sit, right? Huh! Why do you keep quiet when he's talking crap? Just allow me once and I'll stab him right here. Hey, you're seeing anger in his eyes. I see pain in his heart. Do you know how soothing I feel seeing his pain? He's dead snake, leave him. Everyone's life will have bitter remembrances, dude. Would you ruin your life by not moving on over Anshu? Anshu isn't a remembrance dude, she's my life. Hey Sravani, open the door. [knocks] Hey, don't you have any other work?

He is took oath to Lord Appanna, it's unholy. Who said so? No problem, give it. Thanks. "After I completely drowned," "in admiration with love" "I wrote a love letter" "with these eyes" "No idea" "whether my present reaches or not" -"Heart with hopes" -I need water. -"is behind with hopes still alive" -Mom, get water.

Thank you. -"look at me for once" "I'm like this and will be so" "as your shadow forever" "I'm like a lamp burning" "with tears without you" "With the burden of being far away" "My life is standing still" "When are the moments for you to be with me and move along?" -Hey, what are you doing? -Hey, she is your neighbour. -Hey, what's your college? -Hey, what are you doing here? -Go away from here. -Bugger off. "Sweetness of love" "is understood from your naughty thoughts" When beloved's looks touch, -Sravani, it is full. "Won't you be moved?" "I'm waiting and trying to trap you," "can't I get you?" -Hey, leave me Jonty. She will come. -Come with me Purna. -Pullover. -She said she would come. -Everyone is watching. -She promised me. -I should be there when she arrives. -Are you mad? -Please listen to me. -Drive, go. "This beautiful girl wished for you, Oh sweet and handsome guy" It's been 4 days since you came home. Where all should I search for you? Who is the girl, son? Where did she come from? No idea whether she is there or gone? How can you ruin your life for her? You shouldn't go out of the house at all, consider this as a warning. -[weeps] Damn! -Hey, Purna [gate creaks] Sravani, Don't go.. Don't go... Did know anything about him -Excuse me, Your friend is lying at volleyball court. -Purna -Hey, Purna -Purna -Hey, Purna -Hey! -Purna, get up man. What are you doing? Did you know anything about Anshu? They have vacated their house and left the city. Purna... Hey, Purna Hey, Purna... We tried getting her phone number but we couldn't get it. Your father is searching for you from 4 days. -Hey, Purna. -Come, let's go home. Hey... Careful, uncle. -Thanks Aunty. -Okay. -I am alright. Go home, dear. -How are you feeling, uncle? No problem, uncle. Get inside. I am fine, dear. Please go to your home. Uncle had a blackout and fell. I and Saraswathi Aunty have taken him to the hospital. The doctor said his BP got lowered. He is here. You go home. -Medicines. -It's alright. Go home, dear. He is here, right? Go home, dear. Thanks. Hey... During your childhood, I held you from falling down when you learning to walk. Now you are 30 years old and I am holding you when you are falling down in inebriated state. I am your father, right! I'll hold you whenever you fall down. But I am getting old now... I won't be any longer. If I die suddenly, who will take care of you? And this grief is giving me BP and Sugar. [weeping] Why didn't you agree to get married? I won't marry anyone other than Purna He's an unworthy idiot I'm not going to marry anyone except him. What're you doing? Hit me or kill me, I'm going to spend my life with him. I'll die if you oppose me but I'll not marry any other guy. Hey! Please don't... [weeps] You heard it right, sir. My daughter said she'll marry no one except your son. She also said that she would die if this doesn't happen. I have no other way, sir. -Please accept my proposal. -Sir... How long would you be like this? Look at him, he is devastated. If you marry Sravani, he can relax that someone cares about you. If not, he will die some day with that grief. You will be the reason for that. Hey... not caring about your parents while they are with you, and when they pass away remembering that you have not done anything for them is so unbearable. [wedding chants] [railway announcement] Madam, someone came for you. -Ask him to come in. -He's asking you to come. I came to drop a friend who was leaving to Hyderabad. There are no trains go to Hyderabad from this station. Oh, is it? Oh no! No problem, he'll get to know about this. -Is the station ours? -Not ours, it's governments property. Yes, the same. -[railway announcement] -Umm... I have no need to live on wife's income. Nothing. Did you call? You didn't call me, right? Yes, I called you. While washing your clothes in the morning, in your shirt pocket... Yes, you left thousand rupees. Oh, this are mine right? -Yes, yours. -Not yours, right? No... -Sure. -Yes, sure. Ok. Walkman playing: "Lag Jaa Gale song from the movie Woh Kaun Thi" [walkman continues playing] You should have some shame, idiot. To take money from wife... Give some brains to your son. Hey Apparao, are you listening? Food eating, dress worn and finally what he drinks is from his wife' income. Who are you to say? -Ah? -Yes, Aparna. You are listening right? You should say like that, What's his problem when you both have an understanding? Still, after reaching a stage should sit home and watch Chaganti or Garikapati, but what's he scolding your husband before you? It's wrong right? There's none on the other side of the phone, right? There's none even on that other side, right? Stop it dear, he used to drink a quarter and now because of you he had full. Hey, this philosophy and songs won't fetch food. -Get up, how long will you be so? Get up. -Father-in-law! -[gasps] -See... Once you lose something nothing comes back later, son. It may be a thing or even a human. Walkman playing: "Lag Jaa Gale song from the movie Woh Kaun Thi" [sighs] Father-in-law... you feel it'd be good if he stops drinking. But I feel it'd be good if his wound at the heart is healed. Mix more water guys. Saying to give bachelors party in Goa, you make us sit here under the tree? Come on dude, budget is gone high even for this. Hey, all of you don't drink and leave. You should be here till the marriage is over. They'll be dude. -[laughs] -[wedding percussions] Hey dude! Come on, marriage party. Huh! Bring two more full dude. Why two? Hey, I thought you will not come. -Come on. -I need a job, dude. What happened now, dude? I said right? I need some job. Set a job in some bar, dude. He'll drink there and sleep right there. Hey, I'll break your jaw. -Did I speak anything wrong? -It's correct right? You come to the showroom with me Just come and sit like that I'll talk to the owner. Ok? Come on. You too decided that I'm unfit for nothing than to just sit, right? What exactly is your problem, man? You show anger over Anshu on Sravani, anger over Sravani on your dad and anger over your dad on me. You know what he said? -He said Anshu won't come back again. -She won't come and I too was saying the same. See him, you know how much did he love Indu. Some Padma it seems, match was seen just 10 days back. See how happy is he. Name of the girl we write on love letter won't be there on the wedding card, dude. Really are you happy now? That's why I am giving you party, right! -Really? -I mean, mom's health isn't well at all. I too am growing old, Indu won't come back anyways and thus. -How much the dowry? -Car, 10 lakhs and two acres fertile land. They are giving heavily. What now? What do you say? "Looking one by one girl and checking height and weight" "Parents fixing matching, dowry giving" "Looking one by one girl and checking height and weight" "Parents fixing matching, dowry giving" "Marriage bells ringing, single bed sharing" "Inside first love killing, you're dying" "Where is the, where is the..."

Leave me. -You got so high man. -Will you listen to me or not? -Hey, leave me. -All are watching. -I'm not any high. Stop. -Sravani has came to take you. -Poor Govind is getting married dude. -Let's discuss about him later. -Hey, he isn't really happy. Jonty! -Thanks, Jonty. -Take care, Sravani. Come on, drive. What, it seems sir, put up a dance show yesterday at the park center? [temple bells ringing] Yes, your dad is sent in WhatsApp even to me. That was for fun in Govind's marriage with friends. What fun? You bought him this bike with great love as a marriage gift. He won't give you a value and what will he give value to this? You've been wiping it daily like it's paint goes away. As and when he remembers that girl, drinks completely in hotel room and dances at the center. Has he any day, anytime filled 250 ml of petrol in this bike? What's your worry about, now? Is it about him or about your petrol? Put even sweaters and rugs dude. It will be very cold there, it seems. Still, why'd we feel cold, we're always on right? -Father-in-law! -Yes? He's going away somewhere feeling bad for what you said in the night. If he had so much self-respect, he should've gone long back leaving the house. Shucks! -What son, where are you going? -I'm going on a work. What is work, it'll have a place and purpose. -Where are you going? -We are going to Dehradun uncle. -Srinu brother, called us. -Dehradun! Hey, take even Sravani with you. You haven't taken her anywhere after marriage, she'll also have fun. What dear? Come on take her, son. I'm not going on honeymoon but going for a job. -Hey! -Say this dude. No need to say, he heard. Huh! Oh no! Srilakshmi... -Srilakshmi! -Yes, coming. -Here's a surprise. -What? It seems our son in law is going to Dehradun on a work. That means fame and prestige of our family, are spreading now even to the neighboring states. It's good, right? He's going for a job. What job is that? Maybe this job and who knows. Maybe this job and who knows. Come on. This year five to six students from our Academy should be selected for Nationals. Srinu, I want the whole selection process to be transparent. -I believe in you, -Sure, sir. -Good luck. -Thank you, sir. [birds] What else dude, how is Sravani? She's fine brother. I couldn't come down for your marriage. We didn't expect he would himself come to his marriage, brother. [laughing] This is the top Cricket Academy in India. It is a big matter to get selected from here. I should select the best 40 from the 100 players to be coming tomorrow. So, if you are by my side my judgment will be more perfect. What by my side, you stay back right here. If you don't have any problems... Are you a problem for me? I'll talk to the management tomorrow. Take it. [chuckles] Ok dude, how is Bhushan? After he cut his mustache, he is moving around like a swollen bull. [laughs] Poorna, when we played the match first time with Navy team, the off drive six you hit... Wow, what a shot it was. That was a beauty. Why did you remind now again? Look, he's into the time machine again. He still didn't forget Anshu. He isn't being good with Sravani also. That poor girl is feeling so bad. What can we friends say much? He should have that. He's come here, right? He'll set by himself. Sikha Saini from Jharkhand. Keep it on the off stump. Leg spin. Ishaan from Uttarakhand. -Next player. -Meera from Delhi. -Just show me defense. -Ok. Why is she playing like, bother? Meera, come here! Why did you do that? This isn't a match. I asked you to show the defense. But, I like attacking play. -Don't show attitude. -Shucks! What's that discussion, brother? Looks like she is very arrogant. How should the game be? It should peaceful like in a penance. Are you speaking about peaceful mood sir? Send that girl away brother, she's unfit for cricket. Who the hell are you? Who are you to say me unfit for cricket? If you have the guts, make me out and show. -Then judge me, ok? -Stop it. Out of the ground. Next player. Fraud is happening here in the selections. You know what, they asked me to get out. Some random Telugu guy, thinking I don't know Telugu has scolded me. If you don't come and take me in the evening, I'll come back to Delhi by walk. You know that I do what I say, right? -After making her bat first... -Hey, who is the coach here? Yes, I am the coach. Who said my granddaughter cannot play cricket? Did you say that? -No sir, let me explain the situation. -I don't want to listen to any explanation -What do you think? -Just not the technique of the sport, we also have to work on the attitude of the player. Why did he come here, dude? He took away Anshu and made me lose my life. Hey, leave about past. Why did you come? What more do you want to take from me? Did you get Anshu married? No idea whom you got her married to, but one thing is true. She won't ever be happy just like me. As if she is alive to be happy. I got her married to Kunal without her wish. She thought to die many times unable to forget you. She stopped talking with me. She thought to live only after she got a baby, just for her. But, God hasn't given her that chance. Last year in an accident, both Anshu and Kunal... The girl you scolded in the morning, Meera... She's Anshu's daughter. She got selected for Delhi under 19 cricket team just for 13 years. She's disturbed a lot with Anshu death. Unable to concentrate in cricket, she lost her place in Delhi cricket team. I changed so many academies for practice, But, no use... She is a good player. What needs to change isn't the technique but attitude. Why shouldn't that change start with you? "Not sure when does this relation date back to but it will stay forever" I can never give back your love. At least if Meera becomes a good player because of you, I feel to have said sorry to my daughter for my mistake. Poorna... Please. -"Till I reach you" -I won't go grandpa. He is not at all looking like a cricketer. I don't trust him. After going to Vizag ask about Railway Poorna. You'll understand yourself, what sort of a Cricketer is he Please... Trust me. -Ok, man. -Bye, brother. -Ok, brother. -All the best, Meera. [door creaks] Who are you dear, whom do you want? -What is this? -Whom do you want dear? Who is she? Who is this girl? Whom do you want dear? -Where is my room? -You can stay with her in that room. What in which room? I won't share room with strangers. No problem, I'll share. Err... Okay, go. Who is she? Who is that girl? Who is she? What? Who is she dear? He said Dehradun, job and why is he here now suddenly with a girl? -Father-in-law. -Yes? I think my husband adopted this girl? He's Mahesh Babu of Srimanthudu film to adopt. He isn't saying even when we are asking, did you notice? We should urgently find out who that girl is. I think God's child. Our people. She has so much respect and devotion on God that means, she would have come from a good family. What dear, who are your parents and where do they stay? Ah? -Space -Is it in the space? Dal! 120 Calories. Fried Brinjal! 67 Calories. Pickle! 80 Calories. White rice, oh my God! So many calories. I want to become Cricketer and not a weight lifter. I want proper healthy diet. Don't you have broccoli or something like spinach and boiled peanuts? What, is she scolding us? [chuckles] Diet. You should eat whatever is served here. -Eat -I won't eat. You don't even know what food needs to be given to a sports person. You've zero knowledge. [sighs] Roti? Who is that kid, son? I've been asking from the morning, say who is she? Anshu's daughter. Do you have any heart at all? Can Sravani bear knowing this? Not you, but I should say to her mother. Why did she send that girl here? Yes, is it to ruin you again by entering your life with this blame? Won't she let you live at least like this? -That person is... -She's dead dad. Her grandpa sent her here, to teach her Cricket. You shouldn't sleep hungry. -Eat at least the curd rice. -I don't want. [cicadas chirping] [humming] Do you have one more? 200 calories, you shouldn't eat. You are a sports person, right? No, no. I'll manage. [cicadas chirping] [sighs] Sravani. Meera. Is he your husband? Yes. Do you know, you are so lucky? That he agreed to teach you cricket. If he once starts, he won't stop till he finishes that work. Yes, he didn't stop till Vizag once he started in Dehradun. Ah! Meera... [door knocks] Meera! [door knocks] -Meera... Meera! -Shucks! -What? -Coach. Isn't there a shower? It's there, but it's not working. [sighs] -All the best. -Thanks. Lakshmi, it isn't the time to open the wine shop yet, why son-in-law woke up and going so early? By the way, who's that girl, hubby? We shall know the same. [cock] [crow caws] [cleaning throat] I asked him last nigh dear. [cock] Who that girl is? Our Dehradun Srinu is there, right? His coach... It seems, she is a girl from a family he knows and sent for this cricket coaching. It seems she'll leave in ten days. She'll take coaching and leave it seems. I know father-in-law... that she is Anshu's daughter, I even know that Anshu is no more. He doesn't know what he is doing dear. What he did is right. He is just fixing up a goal. I feel Meera is a hope for the change in him. Hey Kranthi, bowl off stick. Wait, wait. While playing defense, you must play with soft hands. Not in the right hand, you should've the grip in left hand, ok? [sighs] I know it. Ah! Oh, coach sir, did it get hurt so hard? I think I don't need a wicketkeeper. You better stand at third man or at the fine leg boundary, ok? Hey, girl. Hey girl, you know who I am? I'm Sravani's father. Why are you staying in this house and what is your work with Purna? My coach. When there are so many in the world, you wanted only him as your coach? When there're so many boys in the world, why did you give your daughter get married only to him? Oh God! Walkman playing: "Lag Jaa Gale from the movie Woh Kaun Thi" Hey, Meera! What are you doing? My mom likes this song very much. Why did you bring this? Give it here. If by husband gets to know... -Sravani. -Yes? Why do you fear so much about him? [chuckles] Whoever we like, we fear more to them. Why did you take that out? -Simply. -What simply? Why did you touch after knowing this is my personal? Or did you knowingly do as I would feel bad? Why would I do so? -The girl... -Why do you blame that girl? Say if you don't like her being in the house and I too will leave along with her. Why are you talking so? Look, you can come into my room but, you can never enter into my heart. You stay a bit away from me, I'll live in peace. I took the walk-man, why are you scolding her? [sobbing] It's because of me, sorry. It's okay. -Rs. 500 bet on table. -I will win the game today. -What do you have? -Who is that kid, dude? One Cornetto. She stays in Poorna's house. Delhi breed, dude. She's Anshu's daughter. So, they came to one understanding. Is she Anshu's daughter, or did he get and put in his house when born to someone else? I'm unable to concentrate on the game in so much confusion, urgently conclude who's the daddy. Hey, girl. Come here. Hi, dear. How's your mummy, is she good? -What? -Your mummy and we were close friends. Is it, really? Why are Paidi Raju and others talking with the girl, dude? How is daddy and where does he stay? Looks like they make some mess. -Say where does he stay? -Say it! Can't you speak up? Where is daddy? Ah! Hey! Hey! Oh! As he hit so hard and that's confirm that he is the daddy. Why are you taking the stick? Will you hit? Then hit. -Come on, hit. -Hey! Poorna I am warning you don't come close. Poorna I am telling you, this isn't correct. Hey! Poorna, don't hit on the head. -Hey! -Look Purna, this isn't correct. We shall sit and discuss if anything is wrong. What's not correct, idiot? -Should we sit and discuss? Come on. -First leave his hand and sit. We shall sit and discuss You first be seated come on. [screaming] Hey, you stay right here, I'll see your's and her end. What will you do? -Hey Purna, stay here. You be right here. -What you want to settle? -Hey! I will see your end, -Stop there! Stop there. Let's settle the matter come on. I'll... Hey! Ah! What? Whoever wants to come, come on. -Come on, idiots. -Hey! Purna, it's not correct. Hey get in, get in the vehicle guys. Isn't it true that you and her mother loves each other. Didn't you roamed around beaches and parks? Will you hit all those, who ask? Truth is like fire, rascal. Come on let's move. Do you know my mom? Let's talk all those at home, move. Do you know my mom? -I know. -When did you both get separated? Did you even torture my mom like Sravani? Have you done the mistake? -Or did my mom did the mistake? -Hey! -What is this Meera? -I should know right away. Poorna's dream was to play for Railway team. When we all played for jobs, he used to play with zeal that at least one player from Gnanapuram should be selected for Indian national team. Your mom got introduced then and both fell in love. Not like what you thought Meera. You know how difficult is it to leave the one we love like life and go? And your mother that day left and went away as nothing should happen to Poorna. He left playing cricket as he couldn't forget your mother. Sravani? Even God does mistakes, Meera. He can't come and say sorry like humans, right? Thus when he takes away something from us, he gives something else. Maybe he thought to have done mistake by taking away Anshu, he gave Sravani as wife. No idea when would he accept Sravani. I don't know how much did you understand in this? I'm saying this so that you should never misunderstand about Poorna or your mom. Sorry, coach. No problem. I said sorry, right? Why can't you smile? A bit more. -Bhuvaneshwar? -Yes, dear. -No, need. -What, no? Your salary gets double and your respect gets double. I'm asking as I don't understand, you know anyone would jump in joy knowing to have got a promotion. I can't jump so much sir. My husband is cricket coach, so many students, I should take care being with him and this is enough for me. Not that dear, listen. Meera, notification has come for Delhi under 19. Your grandpa sent a mail to fill in details. -We've to increase practice from today. -I won't play for Delhi team. I'll play for Railway team. Here, for East Coast. What are you talking Meera? To get into India Cricket team, you can easily enter from Delhi team. It's very tough from Railway team here. Railway Team is India Team for me. Meera, listen to me. Competition is high and facilities are low here. Whatever hard you try, you'll stop somewhere Meera, please. Then, I'll leave cricket itself. What dude? What happened? Is she gone mad, dude? When I asked to play for Delhi, she says that she will play for Railways. Hey, we anyways didn't play for Railways dude, she says to play for us, right? Let's encourage. For her to play for Railways, one of the parents should be in Railways, or should be working with Railways. Oh, this is the problem, right? If you say not to hit, scold and get into flash back, I've got a beautiful idea. What is that? Hey, say whatever you thought in a flow immediately. Tell her. -What Jonty? -Yes, uncle. -What's the matter? -You should say, uncle. -How's Meera's practice on? -She's doing fine uncle. Background song: "Matarani Mounamidi song from the movie Maharshi" [song continues] [chopping veggies] I know it may be a bit difficult for you, but... Sit, I need to talk to you. Hmm... You will get hurt, it's hot. I came to a decision in Meera's matter. Please don't ask for a divorce. What guys are you in consciousness and talking or have you come drunk? No uncle, we took this decision being very much in consciousness. If needed see him, how steady is he. Shucks! Sravani is the one who have to take decision. It's a good thought, right father-in-law? What good thought dear? Is it enough that you decide yourself? Shouldn't her grandfather agree? Can I talk once with her? -Hello. -I don't know what your name is dear. But even if my daughter was in your place, she can't take a decision like this. God bless you. -He agreed father-in-law. -Did he agree? There, even Meera has come. Meera dear, what did I say you? Didn't I say when god takes something, he'd give something else? Your mom and your dad, these both are looking to adopt you. Who are you? Are you my grandpa? -Even grandpa agreed dear. -I see. -Shouldn't I agree? -Meera, You have to, if you want to play for railways. Listen to me, please. I won't. Does that mean, you don't like me or you don't like him? We'll take care like your own mom and dad. To be my parents, you first be like wife and husband. When should that happen? There should be luck. Like a husband, it seems. Ah! Meera... [slams door] That is, we both have to sleep in the same room, isn't my intention, Meera... Meera! Father-in-law is in night duty, right? I'll sleep in his room. Hey, Apparao. you say whatever but I'm unable to do these night duties. Yes, department is sucking out the blood. You know how much am I troubled? Ok, I'll sleep on the roof. [thunders] [raining] -I'll sleep in hall. -Sleep in my room, no issues. -What? -Lizard. It was right there, it's gone. Ok, sleep. Hey, wait... wait... I have to go. What, today is a holiday for you right? Won't we have plans if it's a holiday or what? All of our childhood friends planned a picnic today. What, on this? Why? What is wrong with this? Old is gold. What are you doing? Start the bike. -No problem, we'll go in auto. -We won't come in auto. "God shows the destination..." "...of every human" "It isn't what you get by wishing for" "When you're tying me now like a truth" "I'm still in those dreams of past" "Though you always see me in your world" "I've been driving you always away" "Though you don't leave me like the tide in sea" "Have I turned like a stone without heart?" "God shows the destination of every human" "It isn't what you get by wishing for" "If you miss that come forward, he ties up something else again" "He drives you automatically to your destination" -Pass me that. -Hey, pass it to her. "All those remembrances from my past" -"How to wipe them out from this heart?" -Sravani. Come. -I can't play. -"The life within me from so long" -"How do I live separating that?" -Run Sravani, run. "How long is this getup?" "Is the fate playing this drama?" "When you're tying me now like a truth" "I'm still in those dreams of past" "Silence searched for your call" "Life is behind wishing for that boon" "Ask my heart and will let you know" "This breath is still there for your friendship" "This love destination for you..."

"God shows the destination of every human" "It isn't what you get by wishing for" "If you miss that come forward, he ties up something else again" "He drives you automatically to your destination" [applaud] [pigeon coos] Sravani, son-in-law is just changing these days. You too will get kids tomorrow. If you adopt that girl now, you'll have fights in between later in regards with kids. If such fights may occur, we don't need kids at all. Meera is my daughter, he is taking care of me forgetting everything. what do I need more than that mother? Never talk again about this to me. I feel very happy seeing you and Sravani like this, dude. No boundaries for your dad's happiness at all. You've asked place for academy, right? If we take on lease for two to three years, we can slowly develop. First player in the academy is Meera. You should give me a share dude. -It's okay, but... -Hey, stop the vehicle. -What happened dude? -I've a small work, I'll come later. Hey, no dude. [vehicle honks] -Why again... -I said to have a small work, right? Hey, listen to me. Hey... [vehicle honks] [phone rings] -Yes, Sravani. -Jonty. I'm waiting in station for him to be coming and he isn't lifting the phone. I too am not getting, you go home. Why don't you too try for once? He won't come, Sravani. You think, he is changed or what? He won't change and he's so, again the same hotel room and the same story. Say if you don't like her to be in the house and I too will leave along with her. Look, you may come into my room but you can never enter into my heart. If such fights may come up, we don't need children at all. Meera is my daughter. Poorna. Is everything fine? I don't have any work with this now, dude. [crackers brusting] Sorry, it seems you waited for long about me in the station. I went having a small work at the association. [crackers brusting] No problem. But, Meera will become a great cricketer in future. Thanks for the help you did in her matter. I getting close to you in these ten days, -what happened in between us... -Nothing. We did all this for Meera. You want to say the same, right? You don't like me even coming opposite to you and you are touching me, sleeping in the same room... Why will I think all this is true? Meera is set now and all this is no more needed now. You be as you like and I'm already habituated. -Meera, come on. -I'll come after some time. You can have food and come back, come. What Sravani, aren't you feeling well? -Sravani, it's too hot. -Is Meera watching us? Yes. [sobbing] When we thought all the problems are cleared and are happy, -why do you say to go right now? -Shall I fix a good time and leave? What did I say now? You'd never gone out of the city and when you suddenly say Bhuvaneshwar, -won't we get tensed? -Move, it's time for the train. Sravani, listen to me dear Baby, you resign the job and stay back home. It's enough that you take care of son-in-law. Let her go brother-in-law, she wishes to grow in her career and let her go. Both got along well right now, right? Why don't you stay back, Sravani? Both are happy now and let them take their own decisions. -What do you say brother-in-law? -All those you want are all around you. Why me again now? [sobbing] What Meera? -What happened? -Don't talk to me. Not that dear, you'll go back to your grandpa very soon right? No, I'll be with you only. I'll come to you when possible. -Never oppose him, ok? -Ok. -I'll go and you leave now. -No problem, I'll stay till the train arrives. Give the bag. You haven't forgotten anything, right Sravani? No. When did you get to know about the transfer? Yesterday morning. Then how did I get to know ten days back? Mr. Subrahmanyam informed me. You said no then and why are you going now? Are you going to stay away from me or to completely go away from me? Tell me Sravani, when you stood with me for so long, did I become a burden for you just in these ten days? [thunders] [raining] Say Sravani, why are you going away? Because, I'm unable to act. I haven't withstood you for all these days. I loved more than my life. Then, even if you were away from me, I didn't feel any pain. Because that had a truth in it. But these ten days, when you are acting like you love me. Every time I remember that the love is false, I feel like dying. [sobbing] I haven't acted Sravani, I haven't acted. I couldn't understand and that's all. That day, I hit Bhushan's men to death. I thought to have hit as I hit in anger that they put hands on my wife After knowing that Anshu is dead while in Dehradun, I too felt like dying. But I stopped with a thought about what may happen to you. I thought to have stopped with a responsibility as husband. Like before marriage, love after marriage won't be visible to the eyes Sravani. It lies in the right one takes over the other, in the responsibility one takes for the other. I understood after talking to you for these ten days. [sobbing] With so much of love before my eyes, I've been searching for myself in between the four walls in a hotel room... ...where I never existed. Not knowing that I'm you. It took me so long to forget the girl I loved. But even after knowing that Meera is Anshu's daughter, it didn't even take two minutes for you to accept her. [sobbing] There's so much of difference in between you and me, Sravani. Love isn't just to take, but I came to know because of you that it is also to give. All these days, though I said no you gave me your love. And now when I wish to give more love than that, will you leave me and go? Only after this life is gone... Tears should never roll out of your eyes again, ok? [music]
