(silence) (film reel clicking) (dramatic music) (wind howling) (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) (wind howling) (man laughing) - Why have you come here, Black Mantis? What do you want with my family? (chuckling) - The days of your power are over, Blue Thunder. Prepare to meet your final doom. (laughing) (ominous music) - My Mantis fists gonna put you away. Watch it! (groaning) (thudding) - Hi-yah! (dramatic music) - [Black Mantis] Putting up a fight, eh? You won't escape from me. (snickering) - Papa! (thudding) (groaning) - Yah! (whooshing) (dramatic music) (groaning) Papa! (ominous music) (laughing) - You'll never capture these. (laughing) - Oh, Papa! - You may wanna kill me but you have no right to hurt my son. He's done nothing to you. - [Woman] Save your breath, old man. Your time is over. - Blue Thunder, the secret of the Snake and Crane Fist has been with you for too long and I'm here to claim it as my own. - All right, then, if that's what you've come for, then take it! I'll give it to you now! - Ah! - Huh? - After them, he's getting away! (yelling) (wind howling) - Don't let him get away! (suspenseful music) Stop him, quick! - Follow him! After him! (suspenseful music) (huffing) - Andy, son, I'm gonna have to leave you here for your own safety. If I don't get back, you will have to carry on the work without me for the good of the family and the clan. Don't forget, I love you son. (boy crying) You must grow up into a strong young man and be proud of your family name. (dramatic music) I want you always to wear this jade pendant and when you grow up, you must carry on the work of myself, the family and the clan. - Father! - Don't forget what I've said, Andy. Understand me? Please. I must leave now. (dramatic music) (Andy gasping) - Blue Thunder, this time you can't run away any further. (laughing) - Black Mantis, you may have succeeded in killing me. My family and clan will live on to take revenge in my place. I never have and never will beg mercy from you. (yelling) (dramatic music) - Father! Father! I'll remember what you said. I won't forget! (thunder rumbling) (pleasant music) (birds chirping) (water rumbling) (water trickling) (pleasant music) (birds chirping) (squirrels chirping) (dramatic beat music) (upbeat music) Oh, the sun's bright. Oh, I'm so hungry. Oh, I must eat. (upbeat music) Huh? A fish? I wonder if I could eat it for lunch. Ugh. (upbeat music) (groaning) I must get that fish. One, two, three. (splashing) Oh, what's happening?! Ow! Ow! Ow! Let go of my finger, you horrible animal! Don't you know I'm not your dinner? Let go of me you nasty thing! Ow! Ow! Let go! Let go, you're hurting me! Ow! (groaning) (upbeat music) (groaning) Come back! Stop this minute! Come back here! I wanna eat you! Oh. Stop. Stop! Don't run away. Come back. Come on. Come back. Come back here. Come back. (upbeat music) (huffing) He's gone. I'll never get anything to eat. There he is again. This time I'm gonna eat you, I'm gonna catch you. (huffing) Come on. Ow! (silly music) (groaning) If I ever get hold of you, I'm gonna chop you into little pieces! (groaning) You're stupid. Huh? What's that? Looks like a carrot. At last, I've got something to eat. (crunching) Yuck. Oh, it tastes so bitter. Who could grow carrots like that? Oh well, at least I won't starve. Mmmmm. That's better now. Now for a quite nap in the sunshine. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) Come back, butterfly! Don't run away! (dramatic music) - Andy! Andy! I'm here! Andy! - Father! Father! Oh, Father, you're back! - Andy! - Oh, Father! (laughing) - So good to see you! (laughing) - Father, you're back! - Yes! (gasping) - It was only a dream. It's getting dark. I should be getting back to the cave. I'm afraid to be all alone in the dark. (whimpering) (screeching) (sighing) Oh. Oh, at last. (ominous music) Wow! It looks just like a garden at home. Just like home. Mmmm, these fruits are delicious. Mmmm, this is much better than that horrid carrot. Mmmmm. - Huh? (silly music) Wha?! (gasping) How dare you touch my garden! Thief! (whimpering) Thief! Thief! (grunting) (smacking) Take that! (whimpering) (silly music) No! No! No! (yelling) (laughing) Knocked him off. - Try my kung fu! - I win again. (laughing) (silly music) Ow! (groaning) Ow! Ow! Ow! (groaning) (monkey laughing) (snake hissing) (ominous music) (gasping) - A snake! A huge snake! (foreboding music) (hissing) (laughing) - A snake, what fun. (groaning) (whimpering) (dramatic music) (hissing) (dramatic music) (snickering) Oh, wake up. Wake up. Snake's gone. Oh. He's hurt. I must get the others. (dramatic music) (quivering) - Who is he? Where is he from? Oh boy. - We must try and help him. We should give him some nuts. - He must be really sick. - Yeah, he's not running. - I think we just leave him he'll wake up. (yelling) Don't think it's serious but I'm not sure. - What should we do? (somber music) Hey, Chimp, you're the cleverest animal in the forest. What do you think? Will he be okay? (shushing) - He's sleeping. - [All] Yay! (laughing) Yay! - Let's leave him to dream. Come on, let's go. - [All] Yep, okay! - Okay! - Let's go! (somber music) - Give me your hand, come on. (pleasant music) (crying) (whimpering) - Oh, my leg. (somber music) (groaning) (crying) - Andy, always be a strong man and never shed a tear. - Father. (dramatic music) (grunting) (grunting) - Andy, come over here! - Father! - My little boy! We know you'll soon grow up to be a strong, handsome man. You'll be the pride of the family and you'll take over one day for you father as head of the clan. (laughing) - Oh, Father! (snoring) Huh? (yawning) (groaning) (birds chirping) (yelping) (giggling) - Yeah, you stupid, ugly, no-good-looking monkey! What do you think you're doing?! (laughing) You've got the ugliest face in the forest. Huh? (grunting) (silly music) (groaning) I bumped my head, you too? It sounds like somebody's coming this way. (upbeat music) (yelling) - You're not allowed to go into these forests! Go away! - You stupid ape, who do you think I come here? You think I come here to take away your territory? Do you want me to teach you a lesson? - Who said you could come here? It's forbidden to come here without permission! Go away! Go away, I told you to go away! Scram! Go on! That's not allowed! (yelping) (laughing) (Chimmy whimpering) - Old man. - Huh? - I don't know who you are but why do you come in here and mistreat my friend, the monkey, huh? - Who are you and where are you from? - None of your business, old man. Now you leave here immediately because you're just not welcome here. (laughing) - Cheeky old devil. You're very sure of yourself, aren't you, boy? - If my friend, the chimp, gets angry, he'll become wild and dangerous. You'd better leave before I have to have you thrown out, old man. - I just came here to pick some plants for medical purposes. I can't leave empty-handed, my boy. (screaming) - You heard him, go on! Get out of the forest! We don't want you here! Get out! Go on! (thudding) (whimpering) - Hey! (thudding) (groaning) - Tell me, young man, how come you live in a forest all alone? - You don't need to know, old man. We're lost but now we're in your hands so you can do with us what you want. - [Man Voiceover] Hmmmm. This boy is strong and tough and healthy. Maybe I could take him with me and teach him martial arts. No, maybe not. Too much of a temper. If it wasn't for that though. - Well, what're you gonna do? - What do you think I should do, boy? - I don't care. You can just leave us here in the forest by ourselves. (laughing) - Why not just tell me why you're here alone in the forests and I'll let you go immediately. - I-- - Come on, tell me. Why are you here alone? - I've got no parents or brothers or sisters. That's why. - Oh? Well then what's your name, boy? - My name? I don't know. - [Man Voiceover] Hmmm, this kid must have a secret. There's more to him than meets the eye. - If I do tell you, will you take us back? - Well, okay, but since I've picked many of your plants, I'll teach you some Kung Fu in exchange. Then later, if you meet any wild animals in the forest, you'll be able to defend yourself. Okay? - I don't need Kung Fu, I'm not scared of animals. - Hmmmm. (gulping) You should be grateful of the offer, boy. Now come on with me. - [Andy] Okay. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Your turn. (exciting beat music) (grunting) - [Man Voiceover] He's a really a genius. He's learned so quickly without a problem. - You can stop all that now. Augie's gone. - Huh? He really is a strange old man, don't you think so? (water rushing) (dramatic music) (dramatic violin music) (exciting beat music) (cat growling) Hi-yah! (hissing) Hi-yah! (silly music) (laughing) Don't worry, he's gone. He won't be back. Hey, come on, don't be jealous. Let's just go. - Okay. (birds chirping) (ominous music) (water sloshing) (foreboding music) - This way, he must've crossed the river. Let's go! (ominous music) He must be heading down for the mountains, sir. - We will catch him before then. He's tired and slowing down as we close in. - [Assistant] He can't be far. - We've wasted enough time, here, men. Let's get after him. Come on. (ominous music) (foreboding music) - Look, there, he's here! He's been hit in the arm by the poison black dart and still alive. He's a very lucky old man. - Ha, you think that your dart's going to kill me? - Save your breath, old man. This time you can't go any further. We've got you surrounded now. (groaning) (yelling) (thudding) - Hold it! (ominous music) (screaming) (thudding) (groaning) Old man, wake up, please wake up. - It's you. Thank you. - You're badly hurt, old man. I'll go try to find some medicine. But you must stay here an wait till I get back. (yelping) - No, there's more of the gang coming and we have to get out of here immediately. - But old man, you're hurt and I can't carry you. - But staying here is too dangerous. There must be another answer. - I've got a better idea. Maybe you can hide somewhere near by and rest until your wounds heal. - I don't believe that will work. Black Mantis' gang will soon be here and they're very cunning. They're sure to find our hiding place. - I've got another idea then. I'll try to lead them away on a false trail so they don't look round this area. Then you can hide in a nearby cave and rest and they'll never be able to find you. - That's a good idea, young man. But you're so young and inexperienced, how will you be able to do it? - It's tough but I'll try. (men whimpering) (laughing) Chimmy, come on! (ominous music) Huh? Chimmy, I'll go take care of the bad guys, okay? You stay here and look after the old man, all right? - Aw. - Chimmy, don't be so stubborn! I need you to stay here, so just cooperate. (foreboding music) - So you say that the old man is in the area? - Yes, sir. We were just about to get him but this stupid kid and his monkey interfered, fought with us and saved him. - You fools! Search the area! - Yes, sir, don't worry, we'll get him this time. Don't worry, sir, he won't get away. - You better not let me down. You must fight him at all costs. Find him! - Huh? There's the little kid with the monkey! Don't let him get away! Catch him! (suspenseful music) - After him and don't let him get away! Go! (suspenseful music) Stop! Come back here! Come back here, I said! Come back here! (groaning) Okay, kid, we've got you now. (gasping) (laughing) - It's no use trying to escape, you'll never get away from us. (laughing) - Listen, kid, if you don't do as I say, you'll never leave here alive, understand? (chuckling) - Huh? This man is my father's killer. (laughing) (ominous music) - Where has the old man called Augie gone? Tell me! - I've never heard of such a name. I don't know where he is. - Don't lie to me, kid. You were seen by my men with him when you fought them, so you better tell me the truth. Do you understand me or not, kid? - Huh? I don't know where he is, I only saw him for a second. He's probably back in the forest. - Doesn't look like this kid is going to tell us the truth. (ominous music) You better start telling me the truth, kid, because I'm beginning to lose my temper with you. You're wasting a lot of my time, understand? - How can I tell the truth when I don't even know it myself? - I have no alternative but to leave you locked up in the cells until you decide to tell me the truth. Men, take him away and put him behind the bars! - [Men] Yes, sir! - Come on, kid, this way. (groaning) (ominous music) - [Girl Voiceover] Another prisoner. (dramatic beat music) - Get in there! - I've never seen such a tough little kid before. You know what I mean? - Yeah, he's tough for such a poor one. - What's all this then? You starting to go soft in the heart all of a sudden, huh? - Hey, don't get angry. I just mean that the kid's all alone and doesn't have any parents or sisters, that's all. - Huh? You should keep more on your mind in your job and stop worrying about dumb kids! - Hey, okay, keep your head on. Don't get upset about it, it's nothing. (ominous beat music) - [Girl] Psst. - Huh? Who's there? Hmmm. Huh? (dramatic beat music) (knocking) Huh? - Get up, kid. Come on, follow me. (groaning) - Hey, kid, don't act tough. Now tell me the truth. - I told you before, I have nothing at all to say. - [Mantis] I'm serious! - Sir, I think you should really let him have it. - Kid, I don't think you just realize how nasty I can be. - No matter what you do to me, I have nothing to say! I told you that! - Hey there, kid, have you had anything to eat today, huh? - [Andy] Uh-uh. (laughing) - Is that so? Well, we'll see what you have to say in a few days. - I don't care about your crummy food. - Sir, we must teach this kid a lesson. He's insolent. - Lock him back in his cell and don't give him any food, guards. We'll see this stubborn whipper-snapper takes another week of prison. Take him away! I admire his courage. If I could get him on my side, he could be a valuable asset. I must try to win him over. (crickets chirping) - Hey, hey. You, down there. - Huh? What're you doing? - I brought some food for you. Are you hungry? - No, I'm not hungry and I don't want any of your crummy food. Why don't you go back and play with you bad guy friends? I don't wanna be your friend. - Oh no, you've got the wrong idea. We're on the same side. Really, we are. - I don't believe you and your tricks. - It's not a trick. I was caught by Black Mantis' gang and have to cook for them. Honest. - Then you're a? - My father was a good fighter for justice. And one night, Black Mantis came to our house with his gang and they killed my father and his comrades and put me in prison. - I'm so stupid. I'm sorry I spoke to you like that. I didn't know you were another prisoner. - Please, don't apologize. You couldn't have known. Here, take some food. You must be hungry. - Thanks a lot. - [Girl] I must go now. I mustn't let them know that I've seen you. I'll try to come back. - Thank you. - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. - Today, I'm still alive, Chimmy, and it's all thinks to your care and hard work. Thanks a lot. But what's happened to that brave little friend of yours? We have had no news and I'm afraid he may have been captured by Black Mantis. I must try to rescue the poor boy as soon as possible. If only I could get my hands on the antidote. - Oh. Antidote? (ominous music) - So you are the ones who dare oppose me, huh? Red Cap, show these gentlemen some of our specialties. (laughing) - Which one of you wants to track my sneaking crane fist, huh? - You evil bunch of thugs! You stole the secret of the snake and crane fist from Blue Thunder and now you wanna use it against innocent people! - You sniveling worm, try this. (thudding) (yelling) (thudding) (groaning) (Red Cap laughing) - Justice will punish you one day. (laughing) - Anyone want a taste of power of Black Mantis? (ominous beat music) (laughing) - I, Black Mantis, am truly the master of the martial arts world. (laughing) I have dreamed of it for so many years now and now my dream has become a reality. (laughing) Let us celebrate this memorable day. (cheering) (ominous beat music) (laughing) Let us toast the supremacy of Black Mantis. (laughing) - You're so wonderful! (laughing) - Mmmmmm. (sighing) - This is a really good excuse to have a real feast. (laughing) - Right, cheers. - Cheers. (laughing) - Huh? - Here, for you. - [Andy] What's all that noise out there? - [Girl] It's a banquet to honor Black Mantis. - [Andy] That's just not fair. - [Girl] You must be hungry. Eat up. - You're really kind. - [Girl] Not at all. You know, today would be a very good time to escape. - [Andy] But I'm locked up. - Don't worry, I'll think of something. - Cheers! (laughing) This is the best one I've tasted for years. - Yeah and it's all free of charge too. (laughing) (ominous music) (grunting) - [Pink Cap] I can drink this all night. - Hey. Come on. - Cheers! - Cheers! (laughing) Hey, they're getting away! - Huh, oh no! - Hey, you two, come back here! Hey, they're getting away! - After 'em! - How do we get him? Warn the boss right now? - What? And ruin the banquet? You're mad, we must catch them ourselves. If the boss finds out we let them escape, he'll be after both of our heads, you know. - Yeah, that would be the end for us. - So come on, let's go after these two little squirts, you know? Come on, let's go. - Yeah. - Yeah! Come on, yeah. Stop there! - Did you think you could escape, kid? - And this treacherous scum helped him escape. - I've been looking forward to this moment for a very long time. Come on then, fatso! - Fatso, huh? Well I guess we're gonna have to teach this girl a lesson in manners. (laughing) (thudding) (suspenseful music) - Gripper! (groaning) Hey, I'm right behind you! (thudding) (groaning) (exciting music) - You couple of no good brainless idiots! You let those two kids beat you up and escape! You're a disgrace to the house of Black Mantis! - I'm sorry, boss. We both kinda had a little bit too much to drink at the party and well, you know. - Get out of my sight you bird brains and don't come back until you catch those kids or else! - [Both] Yes, boss. Right away, boss. We'll bring them back. You can count on us, boss. - Bunch of idiots. - I feel relieved to see you back at last. - Old man, do you feel better now? - Thanks to Chimmy, here, I'm feeling a little better. Now who is this young lady? - When I was caught by Black Mantis, Phoenix, here, brought me food each day and finally helped me to escape. - Black Mantis will never let you get away that easily. He is sure to have somebody sent after you. - Is Black Mantis the killer of my father? - The killer of your father?! Then what was the name of your father? - He was the soul master of the Snake and Crane secret. Blue Thunder. - What?! Then you are the son of the great man, Blue Thunder! - Yes. My name is Thunder Prince. Please, tell me old man, did you know my father? - Ah, yes, when I was still in the martial arts world, your father and I were very good friends. - Those animals killed my father and stole the secret! - Because of our friendship, I will teach you the martial arts, boy. - Oh, thank you, old man! Thank-- - That's all right, boy. Now we must leave here quickly. - Yes, master. (water flowing) (birds chirping) - Martial arts is Buddhism and Buddhism is martial arts. You're not in the world of nothingness, you'll never find the truth of martial arts. Abandoned hatred. Once hatred gets into martial arts, it is dangerous. But justice will overcome evil. This is the spirit of martial art. This is the right way. It is also your first lesson. Put yourself in the universe. Compared to the vastness of the universe, humans are just a particle and the spirit of martial art comes from the universe. It's infinite with no bounds. Once you can master the spirit, your strength will come from within and all your strength will come from the infinite universe and nothing can ever harm you or dominate you. (swishing) (whimpering) - That's enough, I won't be beaten again! - That's the spirit boy. And now. - It's easy! (laughing) It's easy now. (groaning) - We'll see about that, young man. - That's not fair, you're bigger than me. (thudding) Ow, my head! Ow! (suspenseful music) Hi-yah! - I'll get you this time! - Come on, try me. (swishing) Hi! (laughing) - Right, boy, your next lesson is to learn how to pull nails. Got it? Now you try. - This will be easy. Here I go. (groaning) (laughing) It's hard. (thudding) - Pulling nails should be fast, boy. Now try again, fast. - No problem. I think I've got the hang of it, master. Now let me see. - Very good, boy, very good. Remember, boy, strength and speed for pulling nails. Now is time for your next lesson, boy. This is the Drunken Fist, now watch. (grunting) The pine tree is tough, yet it easily breaks. The will is weak but it bends. Martial art should be tough but gentle. Your will should be tough and strong and both your spirit and your body should be tough yet gentle. This is the way. Boxing is on way of self-defense but you can not rely on it alone if you wanna be a true martial arts fighter. Don't forget that a real martial arts fighter must abandon pride. It is the only way to kill both strong in the spirit and strong in the body. Remember this always and your will reap the knowledge of the secret of the great martial art. (grunting) - Hi-yah! (laughing) (groaning) - My shoulder. I can't let the others know. (laughing) (yelling) (laughing) (groaning) I better get out of here. (laughing) (upbeat music) (laughing) - Whoa! (thudding) (screaming) (moaning) - Phoenix, you all right? - [Chimmy] What should we do? - Master, she's hurt. - Put her on the bed there. - Master, you're not well. - It's the wound caused by White Swai. It's giving me trouble again. - I must get the antidote as soon as possible. - What's the matter with Phoenix? - She's hurt her head. - I hope it's not too serious. - No. - Boy, you must try to find the antidote as soon as possible. - Yes. Don't worry, I'll be back as soon as I can. You stay here. I'll be back in a little while, okay? (dramatic violin music) - This medicine is for the head injury but as far as for your special antidote, I'm afraid I don't have any and I don't know where anywhere near where you can find it. I'm sorry, young man. - Isn't there any other way, doctor? - There is another way but I really don't think that you-- - Tell me! Tell me, doctor! - It will be difficult and very dangerous, my boy. - I'm not scared of danger, doctor. - Well there's a rare and valuable plant called Thousand Year Ginseng. It absorbs the essence of stone and grows between the rocks for at least a thousand years. - Where can I get it, doctor? - Somewhere around the peak of Mt. Ti-Ti, I believe. But no one's seen it before and no one's ever found it. It's also guarded by an evil snake, be careful. - I see, thank you, doctor. - Is anybody here?! Come out here right away by the order of Black Mantis! (gasping) Are you def in there? I said come out here immediately! - Excuse me. - Old man, this property is taken over by Black Mantis. You must pay all your taxes to him. - You can't! You can't do that, you rascals! - What?! Who are you then, huh? - I'll teach you a lesson or two, you scum ball! - Ah, you're the little brat that escaped from our master's house a few years ago. (laughing) - Hi-yah! - You've learned a lot since then. - You'll find out how much. (suspenseful music) (giggling) (thudding) - I've underestimated the kid but he won't get away. (groaning) (thudding) (moaning) (laughing) (thudding) (yelling) (dramatic music) - My boy, once Black Mantis gets word of this, he'll be after you, your head! You must get away form here quickly! - Please, doc, don't worry. I'm going right now. - Boy, what have you done with the rest of my comrades? - The fools are inside. - What? (swishing) (exciting music) (thudding) (yelping) Filthy animal! I'll get you! (exciting music) Men! Men! Go after them! Quickly, they mustn't escape! You must bring them back! - Yes, right away! - You just wait and see. - Master, the only treatment to cure your wound is the Thousand Year Ginseng. It is found somewhere near the peak of Mt. Ti-Ti. - My boy, I went to Mt. Ti-Ti many years ago but I never found any of these plants, though I searched far and wide. - Master, please let me go to Mt. Ti-Ti and try. - My boy, it is really no use trying. If that plant was meant to be found, it would've been found by now. It is my fate to die like this. It's too dangerous, I can't let you go. (groaning) (somber beat music) - That's Mt. Ti-Ti, Chimmy. (somber beat music) Gosh, I'm really lost. I wonder where on Earth we could be. (somber beat music) Huh? This place looks so familiar. - [Andy Voiceover] Let me think. The jade Dad gave me. - The design looks just like a map. I wonder if. No, it's surely not. (ominous beat music) Chimmy, come around here and look and see if there's a way down the cliff. (ominous beat music) - Over here, over here. - Hey, look. Hey, look at that. (dramatic music) Chimmy, I think we're in luck! (dramatic music) It's the Thousand Year Ginseng. - Hooray! (laughing) (hissing) (yelling) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (thudding) (hissing) (yelling) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (moaning) (ominous music) (water trickling) - You said that you trailed them and that you lost them around here. - Yes, sir, I followed them for miles and miles and suddenly, they disappeared. - You worthless son of a camel. Huh? (ominous music) Look, what's that? - Well, it looks to me like a pair of black pants. - People should be more careful when washing their clothes. - That means that the owner of the pants must live upstream. - Right. (dramatic music) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (exciting music) - [Thug] Anybody inside? (gasping) (laughing) - I was wondering how long it would take you to get here, you scumbags. - What did you say? - Augie, get up and come with us. We're gonna take you on a little ride to see Black Mantis. Now move! - Get out of here, you fools, and don't come back again. You couple of no-good thugs. - Shut up, Augie! Yah! - [Augie] Let's go, kids. - I'll get him! (thudding) - You better think again, fatso. (chiming music) (thudding) Repeat after me. "I must not hit helpless, old gentlemen." Repeat it! Now if you've had enough, you better scram! (giggling) (whimpering) - You couple of spineless cowards! - He's dangerous! - Well, this must be Phoenix, what a surprise. Come on! - Oh, Black Mantis, I, I-- (laughing) - So we meet again, young lady. If you beg for my forgiveness, I might just give you a second chance, my dear. - You evil slimy worm, Black Mantis! I hate you! - It's me that you're really looking for, isn't it, Black Mantis? And since I have never begged for anything in my life, I certainly have no intention to start now. I'll stand and fight! - Well, old man, I must say you still have your old courage left, I admire you. (suspenseful music) - Hi yah! That's it, Chimmy, I've really mastered the art of the Monkey Fist! - Yay! - Thanks a lot, Chimmy, you've been a great help! Let's go back to the master, okay? (suspenseful music) (yelling) - You still have a chance to beg for my forgiveness. What do you say? - Forget it, Black Mantis, I'm not afraid of you and I'm not afraid to die. - Not afraid of me, eh? We'll see. (suspenseful music) - Come on, hurry up! Huh? (thudding) (groaning) (laughing) - Augie, so you're finished now, eh? (laughing) (ominous music) (yelling) (suspenseful music) (grunting) - [Mantis Voiceover] Don't underestimate him! (suspenseful music) (whimpering) (thudding) (yelping) (grunting) Snake and Crane Fist is useless against him. He's really something. - Your Snake and Crane Fist is useless. - What? Who are you then? - I'm the son of Blue Thunder. You killed my father ten years ago and I have waited a long time to get my revenge. Prepare to die! - You may be Blue Thunder's son but you'll die soon. - Andy, look out for the dart! (whooshing) (yelping) (thudding) (splashing) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (thudding) - Interfering ape! - Good job, Chimmy! (laughing) (thudding) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (groaning) - Now you'll see what happens, kid! (suspenseful music) (thudding) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (moaning) (screaming) - Hi-yah! (groaning) (thudding) (groaning) - Wait! Wait, Andy, you can't. - Master, you mustn't stop me now. - Andy, you're not supposed to kill others. - But why not, master? - Because you will be judged by your actions. It's a martial art law. Whatever you do now will reflect on your future life. Killing him won't bring your father back. It's the way of Buddhism and of martial arts. Remember what I told you about keeping hatred out of martial art and respecting justice. If you change a man from evil to good and give him a chance to be a new man, you will be paying a tribute to your late father and I'm sure you will be doing exactly what he would've done in your place. Never forget the spirit of the martial arts. - Master. (sniffling) - I'll remember all of it, master. - Master Augie, please put me to death. I am a worthless, evil man. - Stand up, Black Mantis. (dramatic music) (fire rumbling) From now on, you can forget your past and be a new man. Come on, let's go. (whimpering) (dramatic music)
