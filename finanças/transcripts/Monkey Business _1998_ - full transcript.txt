Hmm, don't we got it made? Both of us sitting here, eating a couple of kosher ballparks. Doesn't get much better than this, does it? You got a little ketchup right there on the side of your mouth. WOMAN: [OVER RADIO] All units, 211 in progress on the corner of Ganesha and Mendecito. All available units, repeat, all available units, please respond. This is Beddinger, I'm responding to the 211, I'm in the area. Send backup. That won't give me time to drop you back at home, so buckle up, kid. [SIREN WAILING] [GROANS] I need a vacation. You too, huh? I'm really bummed. Today Derek is leaving, and so are my parents. First you complain that your parents aren't together, and now that they are together, you're still complaining. At least you have both parents. Besides, your babysitter is hot. I'd rather be bound and gagged than be taken care of by her. Anyway, all these changes are really traumatic for me. -I'm really gonna miss her. -Did you tell him? I tried, he wouldn't let me. "No big deal goodbyes," he says. Well, I'm not going to miss Derek's wisecracks. And what about those stupid hats? Oh, Derek! Derek, Derek! [TRUCK HONKS] I'm gonna miss you, Derek. You crying over him already? Shut up. Besides, you'll forget him in a week. You guys aren't only disgusting, but you're heartless as well. Marla, wait. Marla, we wanna talk to you about our new recruit. Don't you have any dignity left? -Derek's body isn't even cold yet! -You'll like him though. His name's Wyatt. He's cooler than Derek. And so are his hats. Nobody's cooler than Derek. -I am. -Says who? You know, Rico, the difference between champ and chump is you. You know, we'll all miss Derek. Here, doggie doggie. Here, doggie doggie doggie. [CHUCKLES] Hey, doggie doggie. Come here, you're a good dog. You're so cute. Come here, doggie. [GROANS] Nice dog. Now, that's the way to catch a dog. No, I've tried that, George. It just... It doesn't work for me. It's so deceitful. Well, you can't just say, "Here, doggie doggie," and expect him to come to you. Well, I think you're wrong, George. Because I think that they will come to you if they trust you. Now, maybe these dogs have heard about our past. -What, you think they got a pooch Internet? -No, George, not like that. But haven't you noticed how all the dogs in the shelter are talking to each other? Yeah, they're saying, "Louie's a nutcase." His elevator doesn't go to the top floor. He's a few sandwiches short of a picnic. Hey, that's not very nice, George. Hey, you know that I always have enough sandwiches for my picnics. Look, I just want to do a good job here, so that we can stay on when the Leader gets out of jail, okay? Yeah, yeah, I don't want to work for him either. Just the thought of him skinning the dogs makes me get nervous. Hey, George, what if he gets out of jail and he finds us? Look, Louie, he's gonna be there a long time. And besides, we didn't tell Beddinger anything he didn't already know. Yeah, but does the Leader know that? Hey, Cruella! Time to reenter the population. Maybe next time you won't punch the Warden. Come on. You miss Derek, don't you, honey? Well, I'll tell you what. We'll give him a call when we get back, okay? And your favorite show is on tonight, sweetie. We will be back before you know it. Now, be nice to Sheri. Oh, no, not Miss Bimbo Sheri. Come on, now, don't be mad at us. We can't go away with you mad. Then don't go! Look, I'm sorry, Dad. But does Sheri have to take care of me? I'm afraid she does. She's about the only babysitter left that you haven't karate chopped. Besides, there's a whole lot of creepy guys around here that would like to kidnap -a kid like you. -Stop that, you're gonna scare her. Oh. By the way, the Captain said that he was gonna come by and check on you two, okay? I'm not a baby. I can take care of myself, Mother. [SCOFFS] Enough. Stop encouraging her, Phil. [LAUGHS] -Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Beddinger. -Hey, guys. We hope you have a great time. MRS. BEDDINGER: Thanks, kids. Will you stay here a few minutes until Sheri gets here? -Anything. -Especially for Sheri. That's a loser thing to say. Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! Have a good trip. So, when's Sheri coming? Soon, but I suggest that you leave before she gets here. Why? She's just my type. Get serious, shrimpster. I know she digs me, I can tell. Stop it, Timothy. You're becoming a total gross-oid. Yeah, the star thing is really going to your head. -I miss the nerd she used to be. -Well, I'm not going back. I spent more time on that stupid computer than having fun. I just don't feel right about replacing Derek so fast. He's killer. He just moved in from New York. His dad works at the university. You could at least check him out. I think I'll pass. I'm gonna go take Vulcan for a walk. See you later. Suit yourself. MARLA: Dear Derek, I really miss you. I wish you hadn't moved, but I guess that's life. Well, I just had to let you know what was happening with the Cobras. You won't believe the latest mess we got into. It all started when Rico and Timothy were initiating this new guy, Wyatt. We could make him ask out Frida Hothmeyer. That is brutal. How about eating a worm? I heard old man Meyers died from that. -Gross. -[KNOCKING] Come in. -Oh, hey, guys. -Hey. We're gonna ask you a few questions to see if you, uh, fit into our club. Go for it. You're on a secret mission, and you get caught by your parents. What do you do? Rule number one is that I never rat on my friends. You have a really awful teacher that picks on you, humiliating you in front of the entire class. How do you get her back? I pretend to throw up all over my desk, making her leave in sheer disgust. -Just like Derek! -Who? Our last Cobra did just that. He's an expert in fake throw up. Sounds like a pretty killer dude. So, you think you can take his place? I may not be as cool as him, but I have some tricks up my sleeve. Well, there's still the initiation for you to go through. Are you up for it? -What initiation? -Let's call Marla and have us meet her there. GUARD: Come on, let's go. Come on, company's here. Oh, wow. It looks like they let a new animal out of the zoo, huh, Frederick? FREDERICK: Yeah. [LAUGHS] I believe prison suits you, my friend. I've eaten men like you for breakfast. You need a mint, and I don't eat breakfast. Bad for my figure. Nothing worse than an out of shape criminal, you know. [BURPS] You know, when you ever have anything useful to say, let me know. Otherwise, don't waste my time. [GROWLS] Don't you ever touch me! Especially when I'm tinkling. [LAUGHS] You're such a handsome boy! Good puppy, isn't he? -He's a handsome boy. -Look at the shine on his coat. [INDISTINCT] No, Louie, you're feeding him too much. He's gonna explode. George, that's disgusting. He's not that cool. What are they doing here? Who are they? You're on a need-to-know basis. Those are the goons that stole Vulcan. -They're here? -Who? -Oh, him. -He's a she. With a name like Vulcan? We named her that because she's so tough. Vulcan means protector of the fort. So are you ready? Okay. Is that good? You like that? [CHITTERS] [LAUGHING] You like that? -George? -Yeah? -The monkey? -What? The monkey! Oh! That was not funny. You kids ought to be ashamed... Oh, no, the Cobras. The Cobras, they're the Cobras. Affirmative. And you two should be the ones ashamed of yourselves. I bet if this place knew what kind of hideous things you've done to animals, and especially Vulcan, they wouldn't even let you work here. LOUIE: Hey, I never did anything bad to any animals. Tell her, George. I loved Vulcan. It's true. It's true, I would never hurt her. See, we got community service for our punishment, -but it's like it wasn't really punishment, right, George? -Well, um... -See, we love it here. In truth, the community service thing ended about three months ago. It did? -I was gonna tell you about that, George. -I'll deal with you later. I mean, the fact is, we're kind of good at this. Yeah, we're really sorry. Well, I guess everybody's allowed to make one mistake. Hey, back off. I didn't say we were at hugging stage yet. [LAUGHS] Let's help you round up the animals. Wait a minute, I think we have some unfinished business here. I declare Wyatt to have passed the initiation. -I second the dude. -All right. All right, all right. On a 30-day trial basis. [WHISPERS] She likes you. Can we just get on with it? ALL: Cobras! [HISSING] You know, after spending this quality time with you, I'm beginning to think I could use a man like you. I might even have a very important job for you soon. You know what? I don't work for anyone. That's why they call me Leader. Really? Not even for a large sum of money? Depends how large. So, what brings such a refined felon as you here? A man named Beddinger, an Officer Beddinger. -Me too. -Really? Well, you see, we have more in common than I thought. This guy Beddinger and the police went to some extremes to put me in jail. You know, planting evidence, tapping my mother's telephone, following my lady friends, and then concocting phony testimony. -How about you? -Uh, dognapping. [CHUCKLES] -You're joking, right? -[GROWLS] I never joke. I believe that. Anyway, I made the mistake of kidnapping Beddinger's kid's dog. She and her little gaggle of friends called the Cobras set me up. So you were done in by some kids? Boy, that's different. Hey, don't fool yourself. These kids are ruthless. Anyway, I was selling dogs to Melanesia for skin substitution serum. -Dalmatians, actually. -Boy, that sounds complicated. It isn't. Unfortunately, I had these two losers working for me. If they hadn't stolen that brat's dog, I never would have been caught. Hmm, I'll be. What do you think you're doing? MARLA: I don't think I'm doing anything. I am doing it. That is my sundae. And my TV show is on right now. I'm staying here too. In case you forgot, I'm the boss of this house while your parents are gone, and if you don't behave, I'll have you grounded. That's it. [YELLS] [STRUGGLING] Stop it! Get off me! Stop it! Hey! Oh, no, not you! Who are you? I'm Harry Reynolds, the police captain, and you better get your act together, young lady. Hey, she jumped on me. Well, she was eating my ice cream! And my TV show was on right now. I don't see her name on the ice cream, -and besides, I was watching TV first. -All right, girls. -Come on. -You are such a total and complete bimbo. -Yeah? Well you're a... -Ladies! A spoiled brat. -Bimbo! -Brat! -Bimbo! -Brat! Bimbo! Bimbo! -Brat! -Bimbo! -Brat! -Bi... [EXCLAIMS] [LAUGHING] [SHRIEKS] There's a new sheriff in town. [GIRLS SIGH] Well, it just seems like some vengeance is in order here. You know, it's not the six months that I've spent. What it really is, is all the money that I have been losing. Dreadful food that they've made me eat. With any luck, and my over-priced attorney, I'll be out of here in a few days. There's always a technicality on appeal. If you know the right people. Yeah, well I'm getting out tomorrow. The jail's so overcrowded, I guess that dognapping is low on their list. Well, then we'll have to meet for a drink next week. Discuss how we're gonna make Beddinger pay for our time. And the Cobras too. [LAUGHS] -I like it. -Yeah. -Aw, gee, did you give me five or... -Three aces. [KNOCKING] Sorry I'm late, son. I left my... Wallet, glasses, or keys? Wallet in the office, and then I locked myself out of the car. You know how it is. -Sure, Dad. -So, what you up to? Trying to hack some code. Ah, whose platform we hacking today? -NASA. -Wyatt, I told you before, you shouldn't messing with -confidential architecture. -I'm not doing anything critical. I'm just trying to see if I can get in. Their encryptions are pretty good. Hey, have you tried a Trojan horse in their Unix system? Break the connection. You remember what happened last time you messed with -government mainframes. -Yeah, that was pretty cool. Cool nothing! We were interrogated for how long? Two hours? You know, that could have jeopardized my job at the... -University. -Right, the university. [COMPUTER BEEPS] -All right. It's done. -Thank you. You know, sometimes, Wyatt, I don't understand you. Yes, you do, Dad. You did worse things than that when you were younger. Ah... By the time I was your age, I had hacked into NASA, the FBI, the CIA. They were all righteous acts... -That's not the point... -Wyatt. Wyatt, right. That's not the point. -The point is, um, the... -I'm not living up to my potential. Right, that's right. You're not living up to your potential. I want you to do better than me. You have the potential to do great things. -Don't mess it up, okay? -Sure, Dad. Attaboy. Hey, listen, I'm gonna go get a Turbo Dog and a Slurpee at the 7-Eleven. -You have dinner yet? -Thanks, I already ate. Good lad... Guess I'll go check in on Record Boy. Yo, Record Boy, how's it hanging? Space Cowboy, good to hear from you, mate. How you hanging? Pretty good, what you up to? -Just wiggin' out. -So tell me about Bronies. I heard they just got a big record deal, maybe a movie. Everyone wants to be in the movies these days. They're old news. -I wanna hear something new. -Yeah, me too. -Listen to this, mate. -[TUNE PLAYS] [LAUGHS] That was fun. [OVER INTERCOM] Wyatt! Could you come down here? I got my tie caught in the disposal. Just a minute, Dad! Later dude, my dad's in the kitchen. -Until we meet again, Record Boy out. -All right. What the am I doing? Working at a burger joint with everyone there one third my age! [KNOCKS] Who is it? TEDESCO: Your fairy godmother, now open up. Are you gonna let me in, or, um, do we exchange our greetings vicariously? Oh, there he is. How's my old cell mate? Tedesco, my golly. [LAUGHS] -So you actually made it out. -Yeah. Now, how in the world did you do that? Do? It was nothing to do, it was meant to be. Besides, after the judge saw the naughty pictures I had of him, that was that. I see that you're keeping yourself gainfully employed. Now, who is this little pretty, huh? Hey, none of your business, okay? Everything is my business. What is this, personal? She certainly must take after her mother. I haven't seen her for five years. -You have a daughter. [SCOFFS] -That was a long time ago. Apparently not long enough. Look, let's just get down to business. Let me change. What are you doing here? Are we going to go through this every time? Yes, until you leave me alone. Well, why don't you just start thinking of me as your guardian angel, always here to protect you? Aren't you a little big for an angel? Besides, angels don't smoke. Very funny. Let's just go inside, shall we? After you, angel. -Thank you. -No problem. [MARLA LAUGHS] CAPTAIN: What? What? Just you... You get out of here right now! Hey, you leave him alone! You... You have no right to do that to him. We were just studying. Studying? He should be studying something a little less private. You forgot something! [LAUGHING] I'm glad you find this so funny. So now who's gonna take care of me? You? -My guardian angel. -[LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY] [PHONE RINGING] Ah! -Hello? -BEDDINGER: Hey, Captain, you stopped by. Ah, Beddinger, yeah, I was just checking on your daughter. -Everything's well... -Dad? -What's wrong? -Well, we came upon a bit of a situation here. -Is Marla okay? -Oh, yeah, she's just fine. It's just that I sort of fired the babysitter. What is this, early maintenance? LEADER: What? You know, the style of your place. Did you come here to insult me, or to talk business? It's very tempting to do both. All right, I'll get down to business. I've spent many long hours trying to come up with a way to get back at Beddinger, and still maintain my keen sense of the absurd. Excuse me, would you cut to the chase already? -Can I talk to Marla? -Of course you can. Here. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Dad. -Sounds like you were right about Sheri. Uh-huh, you owe me big time. I know you can take care of yourself, but I'm gonna have to have the Captain stay with you until we can find someone else. But Dad! Don't argue with me, honey. Your mom and I are changing hotels. We'll let you know where we'll be as soon as we can, okay? Okay, Dad. Oh, and Marla? Don't karate chop the Captain, okay? I love you too, Dad. Bye. All right, now I'm gonna order some Chinese food. What do you think? Is that the sort of thing you people do around here? That's fine. But first, you need to learn the house rules. Okay. And just what might they be? Number one, no smoking in the house. Second hand smoke is bad. Number two, no leaving your underwear on the bathroom floor. And always put the toilet seat back down, otherwise I fall in. It's happened before. Number three, and most important, I always watch Absolutely Amazinon Monday nights, so forget the football. -No... -Oh, unless it's the 49ers, because that Steve what's-his-name is a total babe. Oh, boy. -Hu's? Yeah, you have an obnoxious child's plate? -Hey! Because of the information you've provided me, I've been able to come up with something I think that even someone with your limited mental faculties could appreciate. [GROWLS] As I was saying, I've come up with a plan that has the joy of retribution against our friend, Beddinger, and your little Cobras. And I also think we could probably drag those two former associates, George and Louie, right through the proverbial dirt. I like it. Please continue, I'm curious. Do you know the name Clive Bransom? You mean the star-maker, the recluse record company mogul? The richest man that no one has ever seen. Until now. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] MARLA: We made friends with George and Louie after they apologized to us for what they did with Vulcan and the other dogs. When Leader was in jail, he met that Tedesco guy. He was some criminal my dad busted last year. Anyway, they came up with a plan to frame my dad when he got out of jail. They hired this guy named Zipper to get the Cobras' band to play in his concert. [SNORING] [LAUGHING] Mmm. What do you suppose this stuff is made of, anyway? I'm not sure. At least it has 20 vitamins and minerals. Hmm. More? Three bowls is my limit. You know, I've been thinking about this whole getting another babysitter thing. I don't think we should. You're doing a fine job. Vulcan likes sleeping with you on the couch, and I don't think you're a total and complete geekster like I used to. -Thanks? -So, I called the station. They said you had a week of vacation left and I told them that you'd take it now. Well, that's just great, Marla. But don't you think we should discuss these things first? Funny. They almost sounded happy to hear that you weren't going to be there for a whole week. [DOORBELL RINGS] Guys, I would like you to meet my angel. Hey, nice to meet you. Looks more like the police captain to me. Duh. You kids got any ID? We're only 10, Mr. Angel. Hey, speak for yourself. I'm 11. 10 and three quarters? Your parents know where you are? ALL: Yes. Don't you think you're overdoing it a little? We're just going to the clubhouse. Only for a couple of hours. We'll be back before dark. Okay. You can go. On one condition! [CHUCKLES] I think the fingerprinting thing went a little too far. Yeah. WOMAN: Wow, look at the limo! Come on, come on! We're late. Mr. Hedley. -I'll catch up with you later, Mr. Hedley. -Okay. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Bransom. I can't... [SHUSHES] Mr. Zipper Hedley, you are correct to feel like you're someone special because I do not spend time with people. So I'm going to cut right to the chase. I want to start a new record label. I need someone to run it. This person must be a blend of vision, command, and panache. That is you, Mr. Hedley. You say you've been watching my career for a long time? I've been watching yours. Now, you may be just an insignificant promoter now, but one day you're going to be a force in this industry. I'm your man, Mr. Bransom. So as I was saying, I have been following your moves, and you have a concert coming up in a few days, do you not? I do. I'm very interested in a group. They're kids actually. They call themselves The Little Cobras. Now, if you move fast, I'd like you to put them on your bill. I would consider that a great favor, and then I could select you to run my west coast division. I don't know what to say. Good, let's just keep it that way. You take really good care of these kids now, okay? Because I'm going to put a very big push behind them. I'll get right on it. And how do I get in touch with you? You may not get in touch with me. You will go to this address, they will play the concert and nothing else. And then I will contact you. ZIPPER: Hey, this is my limo. Where am I? I'm looking for the Cobras. Who wants to know? I do. The name is Zipper, Zipper Hedley. What do you want, Mr. Hedley? So you're the Cobras. Listen, kids, I represent Clive Bransom. We're promoting a concert in a couple of days, and we want you to be in it. You're kidding, right? This has got to be a joke. No joke about it. Think about it and call me. But don't think too long. Ladies. [RALPH CHITTERING] Hey, Louie. Hi, Ralph. Hey. You know, Ralph and I were just having a little conversation and we decided we'd like to take a little vacation. We got bigger problems, Louie. I got some bad news. What? Leader is out. -What? -Yeah. What are we going to do, George? Hey, maybe we could take a really long vacation and never come back. Maybe he'll never find us, Louie. George, but if he does, he's gonna kill us. I saw a movie just like this. And they caught the guy, and they put him in, like, a deep freezer till he just cracked. You are already cracked. Yeah, but I don't want to be cracked, like, to death. I know, I know. Me neither. RECORD BOY: Space Cowboy, are you there? Record Boy? It's good to hear from you. You too, pal. Any news? Hey. Have you ever heard of a guy named Clive Bransom? [COMPUTER BEEPING] Record Boy, Record Boy, are you still there? I'm here. Did you say Clive Bransom? Yeah, ever heard of him? Can't say that I have, why? You know the new band I'm hanging out with, the Cobras? Definitely. I'd like to hear them. Yeah, they're great. Anyways, some guy showed up named Zipper something. He said he represented Bransom. Anyways, he said he wanted us to play some big concert. Sounds interesting. Uh, no, something's wrong. I'll do some research. Play along with the guy, and I'll talk to you later. Signing off! I've got some great news you're not gonna... Cute hat. I hope you like beef stroganoff. What's the news? -Well... -[PHONE RINGING] Ah! Kid, it's gonna have to wait. -But... -I'm expecting a call from the station. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Yeah. Wait, I'm still on vacation. Well, if I have to. [COUGHING] Now? All right, I'll be there as soon as I can. I'm babysitting Beddinger's kid. Okay. Bye. Marla? It looks like your food has taken up smoking as well. I gotta go to work for a few minutes, Marla, and it could be something pretty big. When I come back we'll talk about getting you another babysitter. A real one. I was just kidding around. It's nothing personal, Marla, it's just that this news, well, it could be pretty bad. Well, I don't need a babysitter. I can take care of myself! You just stay put until I get back. [INDISTINCT] [LAUGHING] -Oh. -So, they gave you the week off, huh? Yeah. There always seems to be some big emergency the minute my bags are packed. Next time nobody knows where I am. Come on. Life treating you well, Captain? Skip the pleasantries and get right to the point. If you insist. It seems your boy Beddinger has come into a little extra cash lately. Or maybe he has a hobby involving Swiss bank accounts. You wouldn't know anything about this, would you? I know before you start accusing this department's best detective, you better have some pretty strong evidence. Relax. I'm just following police procedure. No hard proof of foul play yet. It just seems suspicious that Detective Beddinger, with his police salary and all, has opened up Swiss bank accounts. Let me see that. You noticed any strange or unusual behavior from him in the last few months? We all work pretty hard, you know. We're under a lot of pressure just putting food on the table, getting home in one piece. [COUGHING] That's touching. Really, it is. There's just one difference. Beddinger has a $50,000 Swiss bank account. So rather than defend him, why don't you save us some time and tell us what you know? Are you insinuating that I'm involved in some wrongdoing? Or covering up for one of my men? Just a question, Captain. You better have something a lot more incriminating than some bank transaction before you talk to me like that. Look, we're not the enemy here. We're just trying to get to the bottom of this. And you have to admit. This does not look good. I agree. Something doesn't sound right here, but there's got to be a logical explanation. And don't forget that old expression, innocent until proven guilty. It's probably nothing. Who knows? Maybe he won the lottery and we just haven't heard about it yet. Huh. Marla? Marla? I should have never left her alone. [BANGING] [GRUNTS] Hi! I didn't hear you come in. Come on. Come on! I'm so glad you're back. Now, just sit down here, and I have a surprise for you. Oh, I can't take too much more of this, please. I give up. Chasing murderers is easier than this. Oh, wow. I thought I should make it up to you for being so mean. I don't want you to leave. You're better than any babysitter I've ever had. Please stay? Well... Please? [STAMMERING] Well, I'll think about it. Let's... Let's dig in first, huh? Well, I haven't gotten to tell you about the concert yet. Uh... So, tell me. It's gonna be really cool. Are you listening? -Hmm? -You okay? Oh, yeah. I'm fine, I'm sorry. So tell me about this... -Concert. -Concert, yeah. So, there are gonna be way cool bands there. And one of them is so cool, you know, they've been my favorite forever, and... What happened here? It looks like someone died or something. Just as bad. Here. It says they're tearing this place down. But how can they do that? I mean, it's our clubhouse. Yeah, but they don't know that, dummy. Don't call me dummy. When did this come? It was on the front door this morning. According to this, they're demolishing our place in less than a week. So what are we going to do? Maybe we can fight this. Fight the city? We don't have the time. We've got a concert coming up. I don't know, there might be a way. -Guys. -Maybe my cousin can help us out. He has a place downtown. Oh great, Rico, how are we gonna get there? -Guys! -We could take the bus. And carry all our gear, huh? That plan stinks, that's stupid. -Guys! -BOTH: What? Why don't we just fix the problem? What do you mean? Go to the source. The Building Department. Oh, yeah. And all we have to do is get into their files. Their computer files! -And bingo. -No more eviction. Cool. Let's get to work! TEDESCO: Yes, I'm only going to be in town another couple of days. Did you complete the transfers? The wire transfers. Yes, I'm going to need confirmation that the funds did go from their account into my Cayman account. Yes, it would be unfortunate if the money stayed in their accounts. No, no, I think it's better that we let them squirm. And yes, we will be getting rid of that concert promoter as soon as we can. All right. Good. My best to the missus. All right, bye-bye. MARLA: So, Tedesco put all this money in a Swiss bank account to frame my dad and the Captain. You know, I think Wyatt was really the only one that didn't believe that Zipper guy. Wyatt had this Internet dude named Record Boy check him out. None of this makes any sense. This is crazy. Someone is trying to frame him. But why? How convenient too. Just when Phil's out of town. Someone is definitely trying to get to him. Besides Internal Affairs. I better be right, for Marla's sake. I circled the Building Department office that we need to get into. -MARLA: Way to go, Rico. -You know, it's amazing what's in public domain. Wyatt, how are you coming? Good. I've got everything we need. So which one of us is gonna go? Why can't we all go? Good way of getting caught, doofus. I think Rico and I should go. Wyatt's too new. And don't forget what Marla did on the last mission. Hey, it could happen to anyone. [SCOFFS] I'm just not good with computers. I tried downloading off of my dad's computer at the police station and the Captain caught me. It was quite embarrassing. My mom will be gone all day tomorrow visiting her aunt. And Rico's mom here will be at work. We'll be on call here in case you need anything. Hold on! Incoming. It's my bud from England! England? Isn't that going to cost you a lot of money? I'm on the Net. It's a local call. Cool. COMPUTER: Good morning, Space Cowboy. Afternoon, Record Boy. I'm here with the greatest band in the world, the Cobras. Greetings, Cobras, nice to meet you. So, Cowboy, I dug up information on your Mr. Bransom from an inside source. This guy's quite a character. He loves to discover new talent, but doesn't come out in public. He supports five different youth charities and two orphanages. He seems like a man of honor, your Bransom. Anyway, that's all I have for now. Whoa, how'd you get all that info? That guy that was supposed to be so secretive. I have my ways. [COMPUTER BEEPING] [LAUGHING] I get into records. That's why they call me Record Boy. I thought that was supposed to be for your cool sounds. Well, that too. What a goofball. Why don't you Cobras play a song? Okay, but it'll have to be a short one. We have a lot of work to do. Wow, Marla, breakfast looks great. But I can't stay, I gotta get to the station. But you have to eat breakfast. It's the most important meal of the day. [CHUCKLES] Sounds more like you're babysitting me. You're finally catching on. You know, I read somewhere that a 13-year-old girl has the same emotional maturity as a 50-year-old man. Aren't you a little young to be reading those trashy tabloids? You mean The New England Journal of Medicine? Just kidding. Look I'm really sorry, but I gotta run, all right? I'll be back in a flash. But I have to talk to you about the clubhouse! "It has come to our attention from an unidentified source that Detective Beddinger "has been transferring a large sum of money to a Swiss bank account." What? This can't be right. This is crazy! -Oh, hey, just the guy I'm looking for. -Now's not a good time... No, I disagree, now is the perfect time. This isn't a request. Can we get right to it? I got work to do. Oh, I bet you do. It seems that I have uncovered something. New troubling evidence. Do you know what this is? Yeah, it looks like another one of those bank transactions. Oh, I've lost all semblance of humor today, Captain. That's a wire transfer by phone for $50,000 sent to a Swiss bank account bearing your name. You and Beddinger got some kind of big plans? -This is crazy! -Two $50,000 wire transfers made within a couple of hours of each other. Ah, this isn't crazy. This is incriminating. No, this is a setup! Oh, I see, both you and Beddinger were framed? [CHUCKLES] Maybe you were both just sloppy. You don't get it, do ya? Somebody is going through a lot of trouble to make me and Beddinger look bad! Instead of investigating your own men, maybe you should be out there trying to find a connection, -like somebody with a vendetta. -Oh! We'll make a connection all right. I'm afraid we both know where it's gonna lead. I'm telling you, neither Beddinger nor I know anything about this. I know one thing for sure, I will get to the bottom of it with or without your help. Nice. Sweet. Brief. Just tone it down. I'm the captain here. And don't you forget it. You know I wouldn't count on that pension if I were you, cappy. Well, we really ought to have a toast, 'cause things are going as planned. Transfers have been completed. Trail has been left for the police. Two transactions are pending, and when they get a load of this, Beddinger and the Captain will be buried so deep in innuendo, they'll wanna turn in their shields. -To us. -To the money. Yeah. You know, I don't know why I'm sharing my money with you when you're quite useless. You'd better watch yourself, Tedesco. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be pulling this off to begin with. Come on, don't be so touchy. I'm just kidding. Yeah, well I don't like that kind of humor. It's two-faced. Why don't we take our masks off, okay? Good idea, because you know what? I hate fakes! Well, I don't care for you. And I didn't care for you when you invaded my cell. I certainly don't care for you now. But the facts are you have helped me make a big score and gain some retribution against some people that have hurt me. Yeah? Well, don't forget that! Because I remember my friends, and I never forget my enemies. What is that, a threat? Huh? You think you're gonna threaten me, do ya? Huh? Huh? No more complaints? Huh? -She sounded pretty upset. -Hope she's okay. I can't believe all of this is happening at the same time as our big break. And the playhouse being demolished. Get your priorities straight, guys, Marla needs us. -Man, what do you know? You're just the new kid. -Marla, what's up? -Yeah, are you okay? -No, I'm not. -Well? -I found these papers in the kitchen while I was -cleaning up. They belong to the Captain. -What do they say? It's from Internal Affairs. They think my father stole money and put it into a Swiss bank account. -Get out of here! -That's what it said! -Maybe it was a fake. -I can tell the difference. Besides, there's a case number and everything. We've got to get to the bottom of this and find those bank records. What? I'm not Mr. Mission: Impossible. I mean, I'm good, but bank security and the Swiss cheese heads? We'll all end up in jail. I might know a way. You two go to the Building Department while me and Marla take care of this. Wyatt, we'd better go over to my house and talk to the Captain. Okay, good luck guys. -ALL: Cobras! [HISSING] -Let's go! Yeah! Don't pay any attention to the man behind the liquor. BOTH: He's lost it! Um, I think it's time you stopped drinking. I don't drink usually... Ever! And if I ever catch you kids drinking, that'll be the end of you. Kabam! Right in the slammer. -I know what's wrong. -Oh, really? I doubt that very much. We saw the memo on Marla's dad. Oh, no, I really messed up. -We're trying to clear his name. -Oh, I think it's a setup. I.A. is handling the case now. -I'm gonna go make some coffee. -I'm gonna check things out on my laptop. -How do you make coffee? -[SIGHS] I'll do it. Ow! Excuse me. -Ow! -Ah! Oh, while you're on that thing, see if there's, uh, any news on recently released criminals. I think there's actually a website, believe it or not. [GROANS] Here, you can use my phone line from over here. Weird. It went dead. Now it's busy. Hmm. I'll call the Captain. [SIGH] Machine... Yeah, this is Beddinger. I just tried to get you over at our house, but the line was busy. Anyway, we're on Route 1 here at our little secret destination. Sorry I missed you. Hope everything's okay, call you tomorrow. Take care. -Bye. -Bye. -Here it is. -I don't believe it! -What? -Captain, come quick! What's wrong? -You're not going to believe this. -Let me see. Leader and Tedesco were released within two days of each other. -[CAPTAIN SIGHS] -Leader is the guy who stole Vulcan. What a scumbag. This whole thing smells like a Tedesco operation. He's a pretty slick character, mostly white collar crime. Tedesco... Oh, I remember him. My dad caught him last year. Yeah, and we almost put him away too, but he got off on a technicality. Hey, Wyatt, can you check out Swiss bank accounts? We already tried that, but let me take another crack at it. No, still not working. I'm locked out. Okay, I gotta find Tedesco. He's got the information I need. Sorry. Excuse me, I gotta go to the little boy's room. [LAUGHING] -So, what are we gonna do? -I think it's pretty clear. I can't find the information on the Net. The Parole Bureau will have his address. But Wyatt, isn't that dangerous? We won't do anything stupid. We'll just check things out. Besides, if we pull this off, we'll set everything straight with your dad. There it is, Hall of Records [CHUCKLES]. Come on, let's do this. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] -Are you almost done yet? -I told you that this might work. Give me some more time. Some people are heading this way. Hurry! Shut up and let me work. Man, make a diversion if you have to. [INAUDIBLE] [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Help! I don't know what to do! Oh, my God, what's the matter, hon? I was chased here by a couple of gang guys. I ran in that room. Am I in trouble? Oh, no, for criminey's sake, you're not in trouble. Can I get you something? You want a Snapple maybe? -That would be great. -Okay, can you get him a Snapple, hon? Thanks, you're a peach. Oh, my gosh, are you all right? I'm fine, I haven't eaten since dinner last night. Oh, for Pete's sake, poor little dear, why don't I go and get you something, huh? A candy bar maybe? Oh, you're cute. Okay, maybe. I'll be back in just a minute, okay? -Sure. -Okay. -Are you almost through yet? -Done, the files are changed. -Cool! -And I changed a couple of other things -for good measure. -You're too much. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. MARLA: Here's where everything gets really weird. Wyatt's plan was to sneak into Tedesco's office and get the bank records. We didn't even see the creep that grabbed us. Then out of nowhere comes this cool karate guy to help us. We didn't find out until later that he was really working for Wyatt's friend Record Boy, who was secretly keeping an eye on us. He was really protecting us from the bad guys. You joking me? Two snotty little kids! Beddinger's daughter. Well, now I'm gonna remove my gloves. Get out of my sight! Get up and get out! Go on, get out! Useless piece of... TIMOTHY: You know, we should've heard from them already. I know. I'm getting a little worried. Hey, what did you do to the computer at the Building Department? -I just changed locations for the demolition site. -You didn't! -Where? -[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] -Zipper! What's up, man? -I came by to see if you kids are in or out. BOTH: Definitely, we're in! Good, good, good. Because the concert's tomorrow. I'll get you the contract and you get ready to be big stars. Hon. It's real, man. We're on our way! BOTH: Ow! [SHUSHES] [SNORING] Wyatt, we did it. With this, we can clear my dad and the Captain. -You were great, Marla. -Yeah. So were you. Do you still think I'm not cool? I wouldn't say that now. [PAGER BEEPING] [MARLA CHUCKLES] I'd better get going. My dad's expecting me. -Make sure you put the papers in a safe place. -I will. See you later. The police station. Wyatt? [MARLA SCREAMS] Well, even you, Mr. police chief, have to admit that my little plan is, shall we say, flawless. The poor distraught police captain, upset over him and his partner, of course, Detective Beddinger being caught embezzling, decides out of sheer desperation to save the unfortunate daughter of Beddinger from all the pain and humiliation by dispensing of both of their lives at the same time. [CHUCKLES] Do you like that? Sort of like a storyline from a movie, isn't it? A little overly dramatic perhaps, but I would say effective! -What the going on here? -I'm tying up some loose ends. Little Miss Beddinger got her fingers caught in the cookie jar. She almost got her hands on our transactions. All right, you have your papers. Now let them go. Why, does she remind you of some other little girl? -What girl? -You know, the little girl in the picture, your daughter. What do you know about her? Hmm. Listen. Don't even think about it. Besides, I don't know where she is and I bet you don't either. You know, I make it my point to know everything I can about my employees. Of course, you could never have found her. It took me about a second to find out where the little tyke was. I'll put it to you this way, it's either Beddinger's kid or yours! -You've gone too far! -You wanna see your daughter again, you leave me alone! Now look, as soon as I get my money, I'm gonna set them free and I'll forget all about your daughter. There we go. And if you talk, you're gonna end up over there with your friends. I don't want any part of this. You made a big mistake messing with me. Now, I'll ask you one more time! -Let them go! -You're in no position to be giving orders. Now get out! Or you'll never see your daughter again. Get him out of here. I said escort him out. [HUMMING] Kind of late, aren't we, Sedgwick? Make a wrong turn or something? Quit razzing me. It is still early. We've been up for quite a while. -Mr. Early Bird Sedgwick. -George, make him stop. Louie! Right, Sedgwick, what do you have for us? Well, let's see, I got two stray cats, garden snake, cockatoo! [STAMMERING] And this spotty one here. What's she doing here? Sedgwick, where did you find her? Out 'round Taylor Pass, she looked kind of lost to me. Hey, girl, where's your master? No, something's not right here. Yeah, Marla would never let Vulcan out alone. -What are we gonna do, George? -Oh, I think we should call the Cobras. -The Cobras? -Yeah. Something's gotta be wrong. I just called her and no one answered. -Okay, I'll see you in a few. -Hey, pal, you ready yet? -Ready for what? -We're going to Grandma's for her birthday. -I hope you at least got her a card. -Dad, you must've forgotten to tell me. -I can't go. -Why, you'll break her heart. Come on, you got two minutes. -I already promised my friend. -Wyatt, you're starting to upset me. Now, I'm gonna count to three for you to change your mind. One. Two. -Two and a half... -Three! You leave me no choice, young man. I'm gonna do something I've never done before. I'm... I... Can't say it. This is gonna hurt me a lot more than it's gonna hurt you. I can't believe you made me do that. I will see you downstairs. [SIGHS] Sorry, Dad, but I gotta do what's right. Marla! Hello! Anybody ho... Marla. Oh, man. Marla! Marla! Marla! Captain! Oh, man, Marla's in trouble. -I hope Marla's okay. -Yeah, I know what you mean. I hope Ralph's okay too. But he, uh, got adopted today. -Some big movie producer. -You let Ralph go! -Hey, guys, I had no choice. -What a chump. -Hey, you know the difference between a chump and a chimp? -You. [LAUGHING] This is no time for jokes. What about Marla? -Hey, guys. -What took you so long? -I stopped at Marla's house. -Is she okay? No one was there and the place was a mess. -Something happened to her and the Captain. -This isn't cool. Yeah, and our concert starts in a few hours. What's wrong with you? How can you think about the stupid concert when Marla's in trouble? -I'm not, I was just talking. -GEORGE: Whoa, kids... Quit bickering, we gotta come up with a plan. Let's call the cops. I already did that and they said the Captain was on vacation. And we couldn't do anything about Marla for 24 hours. -Oh, great. -What are we gonna do? I have an idea. Captain has a pager. If we track his pager, we should be able -to get a fix on his location. -You can do that? I think I remember the phone number... Next I uplink to Telecon's satellite and put a track on his pager. COMPUTER: All systems ready. Then I use the satellite to track his location. -Almost. Almost. Darn! -What? What happened? I don't know. The satellite was tracking, but it said the unit isn't receiving. -What does that mean? -It means that his pager's off. -Or the batteries are dead. -Or they're dead. -They can't be dead. -You've tried everything. I'm not giving up, understand? Let me try something. I think I got it. -What did you do? -I retraced the last time his pager went off with his cellular company's pager. Let's just hope the address is correct. Way to go, Timothy! Once a nerd, always a nerd! [CHUCKLES] Come on, let's go get her! Come on, you guys. She'd be there for you no matter what. -There'll always be another concert. -It's too dangerous, guys. -I live for danger. -All right. Yeah, we're the Cobras! ALL: Cobras! [HISSING] [LAUGHING] [RUSTLING] Hey, come on. Check it out. Thank you. I know you don't believe me, but I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. But... But what about Captain? I'll see what I can do. But what about Captain? He's my greatest hero. I can't go anywhere without him. [SOBBING] [SHUSHING] I'll try okay? I'll try... Oh, please don't do that. I once had a girl just like you, okay? No, no. Get down. Get down! [MUFFLED CRIES] Hey! Bozos! Police! Didn't even muss my hair. Hold it right there. [SQUISHING] -Got here as fast as I could. -The coast is clear. Come on. There we go. Come on, let's get up. There we go. I... I'm sorry, Captain. I never meant for any of this to happen. Ooh... That smarts. -Are you okay, honey? -Yeah, I'm fine. Oh, good. I need a cigarette. [SIGHS] -Hey, what are you doing? -Monkey see, monkey do. Angel... Excuse me, boys. I really hope you find your daughter someday. Well, now I have a reason. Let's go, buddy. Taking you downtown. What? Excuse me, didn't I just save your life? -There's still a small matter of that conspiracy charge. -Yeah, but, you know... Captain, I mean, let me just explain something to you. We didn't mean anything by it. I know, but I'm gonna put in a good word for you with the D.A. -Just tell her it was all in fun. -Don't worry about it. -Bye, boss. -Oh, shut up! -Are you okay? -Yeah, I just can't believe this. -We were really worried about you. -Yeah! -What about the concert? -Forget the stupid concert! -Yeah, we had to come rescue you. -Cobras to the rescue. Go! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! ZIPPER: We took in a lot of money. Mr. Bransom. I wasn't expecting to see you here. No one really knows what to expect from me, do they? -May I offer you a drink? -No, but there is, uh, something you can get for me. Mr. Bransom, I tried to get the kids. I don't know what happened to them. Shut up! I am not interested in these stupid kids. Why would I care about some snotty nosed children? I am here for something much more important. Now hand me that briefcase. Come on! Hand over the money! Now, you see, we have you and your boy compromised here, and I have a bullet with your name on it aimed right at your temple. If I were you, I would just be a good little boy and not give me any trouble. Okay? Please... Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Clive Bransom. All this play acting is becoming extremely tedious. I think it's time to flush the rats from the sewer. And get this one right out of my sight. [SIGHS] Thank God that's over. You wouldn't happen to have a job for me, would you? [SHUSHES] You just make sure that all that money gets to the right people. Ah... Amateurs. MARLA: Record Boy turned out to be the real Clive Bransom. Now we get to record a real song. Dad and the Captain got off the hook. I miss you, Derek, and I'll write you more tomorrow. Bye for now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good morning. I am Clive Bransom. Oh, no, not again. [SIGHS] Sorry, mister, but we've heard that one already. Ah, right. Well then... Perhaps this will help. Clive Bransom. I hate to tell you this, mister, but my brother once had a card that said Santa Claus. Man, we think you're just another fake. Well, now that creates a rather unique problem. -I have never had to prove who I am before. -There's always a first. You must be Space Cowboy. I think I'd better start from the beginning. It's true that my name is Clive Bransom, but you might now me better as Record Boy. Record Boy? And it's been a pleasure talking to you all these last months. As a matter of fact, I feel like I know each and every one of you. You're Timothy. A bit of a scamp, I hear, but with a voice that is sweeter than anything. Are you really Clive Bransom? Ah, now it's Mr. Rico I presume. -One and the same. -I hear that you lay down one mean rap. Not bad. Ah... And you, of course, are Marla. Now, I've heard quite a bit about you. It's nice to meet you, Mr. Bransom. And I would like to say that I have never met a more tenacious group of young people than you. In fact, if my entire organization was made up of kids like you, I'd be... I'd be, uh, even richer than I am today. -Which is stinkin' rich... Sir. -That's right. I think that now we ought to get down to business. -The record business. -Yeah! ALL: Cobras! [HISSING] [LAUGHING] Hey, guys! Hi! Hey, sweetie. Oh, God, it's good to be back home. Everything back to normal now, huh? You know, we drove right by the school, noticed there's a bulldozer out front. I didn't know they were tearing down that place. [CHUCKLES] [RAP SONG PLAYING]
