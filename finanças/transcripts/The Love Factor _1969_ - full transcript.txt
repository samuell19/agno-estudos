Miss Olsen. Anne. What are you doing here? Why aren't you at the office? Well, I came 'round to see if you were back So I started clearing up a bit. Thought I'd surprise you. Surprise me! I'd have shot you. (Laughing) ** Well, it doesn't really do anything for you. Didn't fool anybody either. Well, you're not going to shoot me now, are you? So why don't you put that gun away? I'm on your side, remember? How did you get in? I found this in your personal file, Along with your collar size, fingerprints And other interesting information. You have access to my personal file? Well, naturally. I am W's private secretary. I see. Don't worry, I won't tell anybody. Tell anybody what? There's some very private details there. What details? Mmm, just details. Well, you can tell W for me I consider it a bloody cheek, His having a key to my apartment. Well, it's not really surprising. You are a spy. Spies went out with Mata Hari and black cloaks. I'm an agent. Call it what you like. You spend your time snooping around other people. You can't really blame your boss For doing a little snooping on you. You can't trust anybody these days, can you? ** Well. What's this? Coq Au vin. (Sniffs deeply) Mmm! (Sniffs) My specialty. Mmm. Well, I'm afraid the dinner will be another half hour. What do we do till then? Have a drink? Be my guest. ** What'll you have? A "punte mays" With ice and lemon. Exotic taste. I'm afraid I haven't got any. Oh, yes, you have. It's in the fridge. I bought some. May I ask what all this is in aide of, Miss Olsen? Anne. Anne. And there's no need to be so suspicious. You are a bachelor. So I thought... I might need some care and attention? Mm-hmm. After your strenuous mission. Just because I'm a bachelor Doesn't necessarily mean I lead a monastic existence. Oh, I know all about your sex life. The files? Mm-hmm. God help us. Why do you endure? Sit down. Tell me what you've been doing. Why, you should know! Oh, W doesn't tell me anything like that. Of course not. Just the details of his agents' sex lives. Oh, he doesn't tell me that either. I found that out myself. You can find out about the mission for yourself as well. That's what I'm trying to do. I want to know all about it. ** Why don't you tell me the real reason you came here? What do you think? This isn't the Miss Olsen I'm used to. Are you surprised? It's nice to know you're human. So? So what? So, um... What are you going to do about it? Have another drink. Now then, Miss... Anne. You appreciate that whatever happens from now on Is entirely our own responsibility. Mmm. Completely at your own initiative. Mmm? And quite beyond my control. Mmm. You really are very attractive. You're not without a certain something yourself. In fact, (Zipper opening) you're very sexy. A bit conceited perhaps, (Zipper opening further) but very sexy. James? Hmm? Shall we eat before or after? After, definitely. I mean, after you tell me how the mission went. The what? Well, how you got on in Scotland. At a time like this, you want to talk about Scotland? Well, I know it had something to do with a Major Bourdon. That's all I heard. The hell with Major Bourdon. Mmmm. James. Hmm? Will you do something for me? Anything. Pour me another drink, darling. Now? Well, I like to spin things out, Don't you? Yes. Ice. Lemon? Mm-hmm. Anything else? Uh-uh. Now then. Where were we? You were about to tell me about Major Bourdon. Do I get the impression that you're leading me on? I'd just like to get to know you a little, that's all. Haven't the files told you all you need to know? No, darling. Not what I want to know. Relax, we've got all night. Well, what do we do in the meanwhile? Whatever you like. Watch television? Play chess? Strip poker? Ah! Now that's better. Strip poker? Mm-hmm. It's my favorite game. ** I'll get the cards. Winner chooses? Chooses what? What we do next. Ah. It's a deal. ** One should always play cards in style, don't you think? Oooh. Which side will you have? I'll sit here. ** (Cards shuffling) That's cheating. Oh no, it isn't. You've got more clothes on than I have. I'll start equal. ** Cut for deal. My deal. ** How many will you change? Oh. Three. ** Dealer takes one. ** One. ** Raise you one. ** See you. Pair of a kings, ace high. ** I can see you've played this game before. Your deal. ** Two. Dealer take three. ** Three. Getting very bold. Your three... And raise you one. Raise you one. Raise you one. I'm not doing very well, am I? Oh, I don't know. I'll see you. ** Pity. ** ** ** ** ** ** ** This is ridiculous. We've been playing for two hours And we're back where we started. Well, it was your suggestion to play cards. Well, somebody should have won by now. I'll tell you what we'll do. Straight cut. If you win, we do what you want to do. If I win, we do what I want. Right? Right. You promise? I promise. Do you? I promise. (Sighing) Very well. What do you want to do? I want to talk. About what? About your mission. Very well. But we talk in bed. ** James? Hmm? I thought we came to do what I wanted to do. Mm-hmm. I mean, to talk. Mmm. Well, a deal's a deal. Where shall we start? Who is Major Bourdon? Public enemy number one. What did he do? He didn't. I stopped him. Really? Tell me about it. Well, let me see now. How shall I describe it? You see, I haven't got it all figured out for myself yet. What haven't you got figured out? It was a very extraordinary business. I don't know how I'm going to explain it to W. Perhaps you can do it for me. Perhaps. Don't just lie there, tell me. Hmm. Well, let's start with Major Bourdon. ** W had a man following him in the city. Bourdon was going to meet his assistant, Swyne. ** W's man managed to overhear a snatch of the conversation, Enough to indicate that they were up to something. ** Hello, WH-One. Bourdon met Swyne, right. (Woman on phone) Okay, BB3. Did you get anything? Not much. He's planning something. Something to do with Zeta, I think he said. And that's all the department had to start with. But who is this Zeta? They still don't know. But you do. Mm-hmm. Zeta is a woman who runs a kind of colony called Angvia. What is it? It's a... A sort of... Well, no, It's a kind of... Well, you see, there's this strange race of women. Women? Mmm. But not ordinary women. Why? They don't have any men. But how do they... They don't. Oh. How boring. And they live in Angvia. Where is Angvia? I think it's out in space somewhere. Or perhaps it's not. Perhaps it's right here, In a different time scale or something. All I know is that it exists. ** The whole place is like a vast supernatural ant colony. The women... the Angvians... Are picked up From all over the world and by brainwashing processes, Conditioned for their allotted functions. Some of them become administrators, Some workers, some fighters. Zeta herself is the queen ant. Who she is or where she originally came from Is a mystery. But she holds the key to the whole set up. All the others have come from Earth. They're specially selected after careful observation, Then a kidnapping party is sent out. The girls are grabbed off the street, rendered unconscious And transported to Angvia By some sort of time or space machine Housed in a pantechnicon. In a what? A large van. Oh, you're making this rubbish up. You think so? Well, you can't really expect me to believe it. Oh, nobody's going to believe it. But you wanted to hear it. Oh, but you can't leave it like that. I mean, what happened? I mean, how did the Angvians come into it? And what was this Bourdon doing? I thought you said it was rubbish. Well, you must admit, it is a bit far-fetched. Yes, it is, isn't it? Well, where was I? Angvia. And what's it got to do with Major Bourdon? Ah yes, Major Bourdon. Well, you see, he discovered about Angvia And he thought that if he could find out where it was, He could perhaps take it over. Why? Power, perhaps? So what happened? (James) So, he got his sidekick Swyne to follow a couple of Angvian girls And W's man was following Swyne. Hey... you can't do that, love! I'll be reporting you if I see you doing that again. Oh, I beg your pardon. Just a minute, mate. Where are you going? Oh, yes, um. Um, Islington. Shan't keep you a moment. If you think I'm changing that, you've got another think coming! Oh my God, it's gonna be one of them days! All right then, go on, up the stairs! Go on and I'll come up when I've got some change. Um, I'm getting off. Just a minute here, you! Not only will I 'ave you for jumpin' on this bus, But I'll 'ave you for not paying your fare either! Come along... Thank you very much! Hey, Four-Eyes! You ain't got your change! ** Is that her? That's the lady. What's so special about her? I suppose she's got what it takes. Which is? I sometimes wish I knew. But Zeta is always right. She chooses well. The snatch is arranged then? Yes. Come on. (Delta blues playing inside club) Oh, lovely girl, sir. Show's starting right now. All lovely girls. Does this girl work here? No, not her... This one. They all work here, sir. What's her name? That's Clarissa Richambeau, Queen of the G-string. Is that her real name? Oh, no, that's her stage name, you understand. I'm not at liberty to, uh... No, of course you're not. Half a moment. That's Edwina Strain. Lovely girl, mind. (Phone beeping) Hello, Major Bourdon? (Bourdon) Is that you, Swyne? Where the hell have you been? Listen, Major. I've got some fantastic news. I've been following those two Angvian girls Here, there and everywhere. Anyway, I was walking along and following them And I was just behind them when... Get to the point, man, get to the point! I haven't got all day. Yes, well, Major, I discovered who they are going to abduct next. It's a girl who works in the striptease club. You're sure about that? Oh, absolutely certain. I heard them all talking about it. Get her over here. Bring her to you? But how? What the hell do you think I pay you for? Think of something! (Phone clicking) (Traffic passing, horn honking) Edwina Strain? Yes? Edwina, will you accept these flowers? I'm not supposed to receive presents from the clients. Oh, you misunderstand. I'm not a client. As a matter of fact, I have some very important business to discuss with you. I'm afraid that's what they all say. No, this is serious. It's very important that you cooperate with us. Us? I'm a secret agent, Department Five. Do you have any credentials? Oh, yes, of course. Here is my card. My boss... That's Major Bourdon... He's most anxious to have a little talk with you And if you don't believe me, It's only just around the corner. Mmm. Well, if there's any funny business, I'll call for the law. But of course. Taxi! (Bourdon) It may all seem a little fantastic, But it's frighteningly true. It's incredible. If what you say is true, then these... thank you. Yeah, he's got some bird with him at the moment. These Angvians, They could take over the entire world in no time at all. Unless they're stopped. And you want me to help? By finding them. I'll try. W's a boy, but he's as pecked as any. We, in uh... In Department Five, Have been trying to discover their whereabouts. They seem to have some secret hideaway, An operational base in this country. Now that's where you come in, Edwina, dear. Please call me Ted. Everyone else does. Listen, do you want me to become one of them? Well, um, Ted, I hardly think it'll be necessary to go as far as that. But if we can get you into their hideout, By swallowing this homing device, You can lead us to them. (Edwina) All right. (Bourdon) Swyne, a glass of water. (With American accent) Hello? Hello, Word... Is that you, Word? What... What, W... What did you say? I want to have a word with you About a little matter that's blowing up. Just a moment. Our friend Mr. Bourdon has been following a particular girl. W, um, tell me, is this girl blonde? An actress. Look, I want to know exactly what he's doing with her, And this is exactly what I want you to do! Yes, yes. A telegram. Well, yes, by all means. (Blues music playing) (Song ends) (Doorman on microphone) Now gentlemen, for your approval, We submit Yolande Del Mar And her passionate python, Prince Raj. Here you are, Teddy, love, it's for you. ** (Ted reading aloud) (Zeta) James Word of Department Five. Now, what do they want with Edwina? Let's send Clotho down there. See what she can find out. Mm-hmm. (Electronic buzzing, humming) You got my telegram. No, darling. You aren't Edwina Strain? No. My name's Clotho. Well, never mind who you are. Make yourself at home. Yes, darling. 287 Pelham Mews. Hmm. Standby, all areas. Operation One going into action. ** (Vendors calling out) ** (No voice) ** ** (Woman) Excuse me. Yes? I wonder if you could direct me to Pelham Mews? We seem to be lost. I was going there. It's about there... Ow! (Struggling, grunting) Ow! ** Yes, Word speaking. Yes, W. Edwina Strain? Yes. I sent her the telegram. No, she hasn't turned up yet. What do you want me to do? All right. I'll wait here till we get a reaction. W is a worrier. (With French accent) You never worry, do you, darling? Hmm-mm. I'm worried. Really? Yes. Worried. Yes, darling. What about? You haven't attacked. I can't. What do you mean, you can't? The bird hasn't turned up, has she? So you're going to attack that bird, are you? Well, talk to her. I just said I'm worried. You've got nothing to worry about. Darling. Hmm? You haven't attacked me for at least an hour. Hmm. (Horns honking, traffic passing) (Eerie droning) (Droning continues) (Droning continues) ** ** (High-pitched electronic beeping) What's the matter? Nothing... Listen! (Beeping continues) I don't hear anything. No, you wouldn't. Um, I have to go somewhere. I'll be back in a minute. (Beeping) (Clotho) Hello, Lachesis. (Lachesis) Oh, I am sorry to interrupt you when you are so busy. We got the girl. I want you to try to find out why James sent for her. Well, that's not easy. He isn't the talkative type, you know. You will have to use a little persuasion. I'm sure you can think of something. Yeah, we already thought about it. ** Bourdon's increased his security. He never had guard dogs before. Zara is in that area. She's making a reconnaissance. I'll get in touch. (Electronic beeping) ** ** ** Swyne, there's a bidge in the bushes. Go see what she wants. (Zara struggling, grunting) Here is the girl, Major. A peasant, but quite promising. God, she's an Angvian! What a stroke of luck. We might find out something from her. Swyne. Interrogation. Interrogation. (Shrieking) Oh! Oh! (Screaming) Aaahhh! ** (Struggling, shrieking) ** Well, my dear. You're now back with us again. (Bourdon) How do we get you to help us Case these evil beings who've perverted you? Let me go! Now calm down. Not until you've been brought back to the human fold. Swyne? Sir? Get a blanket, she's freezing. Major, are you joking? Get what I told you! Marquis de Sade. Now come, come, come, my dear. Now you just quiet down a bit. Nothing to worry about at all. Let's have a little chat. Now, to start with, When did they first get hold of you? Let me go! Now, calm down, my love. Just help us and you'll be perfectly all right. You see, whatever they've done, we'll have to eradicate. Or maybe you might enjoy being reconverted. Let me go! Cover her up! Yes, sir. And where's the brandy? Oh, it's just coming, sir. (Shouting) Go and get it! Well, my darling. Are you going to talk? No! (Clotho) Are you feeling a bit better now, darling? (James) Mmm? I wasn't feeling too bad to start with. James, who is Edwina Strain? Hmm? What do you want her here for? W's orders. (Phone ringing) ** Word. (W) Has the girl turned up yet? Hmm. She certainly has. What... Has the girl tuned up yet? The girl! Uh, no, I'm still waiting for her. Then forget it. Forget it? While you've been waiting, she's been kidnapped. Kidnapped? Yes, kidnapped. Stop repeating everything I say. (Giggling) Stop. Stop. Stop what? Oh, sorry, sir. Um, kidnapped. Who by? How the hell do I know? Get over here pronto. Pronto? Instantly. Instant Word it is. (Phone clicking) Who was that? W. W? The boss. Now what? I have to go. Please, darling. I just want to talk to you. ** Well, this is the most ridiculous story I've ever heard, Mmm. But there's no need to go into the sordid details. Just get on with the story. Well, I went to see W in his office. ** ** (Male robotic voice) Call out your floor please. Call out your floor please. 13th. 13th what? 13th, please? Thank you. (Doors whirring) You just don't get any politeness these days. Here's me slaving up and down all day And never so much as a please or a thank you. People like you make me sick, sick, sick. We've stopped. That's right. Well, are we going on? You can do what you like. I'm staying here. This is my tea break. Couldn't we go up a few floors? You could have your tea break then. Why should I do any favors? Please? Well, all right. I don't know what the world's coming to. I'm expected to work all hours of the day and night. I tell you straight, I wouldn't let a son of mine be a lift. Everybody out. This isn't the 13th. This is the 12th. I'm superstitious. You'll have to walk the rest. Thank you. Get stuffed. (Strange whirring) Sit down. Bit jumpy, aren't you? What kept you? I came as soon as I could, sir. The girl Edwina's been kidnapped. You told me on the phone. So what were you doing? Um, getting dressed. Getting dressed? Clotho... Uh, clothing myself. Clothing? Yes, I had a bath. Had a... you... At a time like this, you took a bath? I like my agents to be neat, but this is ridiculous. Cleanliness is next... Cleanliness is next to nowhere unless you get that girl! She was on her way to your place With information on Bourdon... Vital information. I want two things. A., I want to know what that information was, And B., I wanna know who kidnapped her. Bourdon? You think I haven't thought of that? I've checked. None of Bourdon's people were in the area at the time. I want that girl found... fast! I don't even know what she looks like. Johnson, come in here. (Blues music playing) (Music continues) (James) You want me to find that? (W) And get her talk. Supposing she won't? Word, That's the girl they've got And that's the girl I want you to try and find. You try and stop me. (Gun firing) Very good shot, sir. What interests me is what's happened to our girl Edwina. It would appear that she was kidnapped. The homing device inside her sent out the signals perfectly, But after the kidnapping, the signals stopped. (Gun firing) And you haven't picked them up again? We're working on it, sir. Right, I want to know as soon as you locate her. They can't possibly know that she's bugged. Of course. And in the meantime, of course, I think we might go and have a little fun With that Angvian girl. (Laughing) (Gun firing) ** Bourdon's got Zara. What? Bourdon's got Zara! Stay tuned to this channel. I'll report to Zeta. ** Yes, Lachesis? Zeta, it's bad news. Bourdon's people have caught Zara. How long ago was this? Only a few minutes ago. Then there's still time. I can go myself. No, no, you stay here. Are you in touch with Clotho? She, uh, she's at James Word's place. Then tell her to go at once to Bourdon's place. To Scotland? Yes, Clotho. You're the only one that can go. Well, what about James? I can't just disappear. Don't worry. W knows Bourdon is in Scotland, So he'll probably send James anyway. (Click) (Seductively) Hello. Hi. ** (Chuckling) ** (Door closes) ** So, you are Edwina. I don't know what you want from me, But I'm pretty sure you didn't go to all this trouble For just the fun of it. You know Major Bourdon. All I want to know, my child, Is how you are connected with him? Connected with who? Bourdon. You must know Bourdon. They would go to any lengths to destroy us. Why? 'Cause at many times we have stood in his way. His way to what? (Chuckling) Lachesis. Show our "guest" the colony. She obviously doesn't know much about Bourdon. ** ** This is a self-revelation room. ** ** Right, come with me. ** (Lachesis) This is where we bathe. ** (Lachesis) Here you can see the fighting force undergoing exercises For muscle control, balance and poise. ** ** Come. Over here. And have a look at the contemplation rooms. We teach contemplation as a very important part of our training. ** Atropos, would you explain to our friend? Come 'round here. This is the static time area As Zeta explained to you earlier. We all take a period of time in here So that we only live for a month in each year. Now watch this. ** (Atropos) This is one of our dormitories. ** And of course, we have to eat every few hours, But not the food that you would know. It contains chemicals to maintain our physical powers. Each day, the fighting force train. This training has two purposes. It keeps us fit And it relieves aggressive tensions. ** All our forces can be sent Anywhere on Earth at a moment's notice. (Edwina) But how do they get to Earth? It's a simple enough process, Although I doubt if I could explain it to you. ** First they are dressed into Earth clothes. The earth transmission vehicle transports them In just a few seconds. ** Lachesis, take our friend to the control room And show her the Earth monitoring screen. (James) Why kidnap Edwina? (Clotho) Maybe she had... (Lachesis) This is the control room where we monitor pictures From the various sources we are interested in. (Edwina) But they were talking about me! (Lachesis) You were supposed to meet James Word, weren't you? (Edwina) Yes, I was, until I was dragged away into that car. (Lachesis) Why? Why did James send for you? Was it because you know something about Bourdon? I know nothing about him! (Lachesis) You were connected with him in some way, weren't you? No, no, I wasn't! Don't, for heaven's sake, try and protect Bourdon! Look at this! (Bourdon) Have you decided to talk? (Zara) No! (Bourdon) Very good. Give her the number five. (Swyne) Oh, my favorite! (Humming a tune) Get out of the way, man! He doesn't really deserve any protection, does he? I hope you're not going to be disappointed this time, James. Never. You're getting the full works this time. I don't think I can stay long. (Electronic ping) (Growls playfully) Clotho? (Electronic ping) (Birds chirping) I'm not very happy about that Edwina girl. How do you mean, Zeta? I don't know. It's just a feeling. After all, we don't know very much about her. She could be working for Bourdon. Well, it would be so easy. There must be some connection. After all, that's why we brought her here in the first place. You see, Bourdon couldn't sneak anyone in here directly. He doesn't know where we are. But by getting us to kidnap one of his own people And bring her here, well, all she would have to do Is let Bourdon know our position and... Pfft!... That's it. I still don't think so. Edwina is just bewildered. Not really hostile. Hmm. I wouldn't put anything past Bourdon. Anyway, you better take the girl to the conditioning room, Just to be on the safe side. ** ** (Bourdon on radio) H-1, H-1, where the hell are you? H-1, give me your position. Give me your position! (Pilot) Base, H1. Position approximately 14 miles southwest of base, over. (Bourdon) Any signal from the homing device yet? Over. Negative. Well, keep patrolling that area! She must be there somewhere! ** ** ** ** (Rope whooshing) (Zeta) They're getting far too close. How are they tracking us? Switch to Maximum Force Field! Right. That should be about it. Good, good, just enough to de-power it. (Zeta) It'll flutter down like a sycamore leaf. ** (Zeta) Now, standby. Good... (Gasping) If you want to live, tell her to switch off. (Scoffing) Contact that plane and tell them I'm here or I'll kill you. (Zeta) I thought so. She is Bourdon's agent. Take her to the conversion room. There must be some connection between her And Bourdon's helicopter. Erase her memory and return her to where she was picked up. ** Where is Angvia? Where is your witches' hideout? (Device clicking loudly) (Shrieking) (Bourdon) I want to blow it off the face of the earth. I want to see that Zeta driven back to where she came from In pieces! For years now, Your disgusting tribe has been interfering with my plans. She's not gonna speak. We'll try her on the chair. (Gasping) (Manacles unfastening) (Swyne humming) Impertinence! ** (Screaming) (Thud) ** What a waste. ** (Electronic ping) (Car engine humming) (Edwina's tracking device signaling) (Signal continuing) We're getting it faintly. I'll soon have a direction on it. And I can do better than that. In a minute or two, I'll be able to pin down its source. Then you can't be very far off. At last. (Birds chirping) Yes. This last reading puts their position somewhere near here. That's still only a radius of 20 miles. It's not good enough. (Dog barking) (Dog barking) Bourdon's got Clotho. Action 69. (Bourdon) So another little Angvian has come to visit us. I must say, they're improving all the time. This one's right up to scratch! Come here. Well, lift up your skirts and let's see your pretty legs. Oh, darling, wouldn't you rather do that for me? Hmm, I think you're about to witness A most interesting scene. (Grunting in pain) Little bitch. Hurt my pride, would you? (Laughing) Darling, Don't you like a little fight with it, hmm? I like fighting with little Angvians. Take her to my rooms. I think I'll deal with this one personally. Swyne, get to the helicopter. Are you going to take off, sir? Not that, you fool... On the radio! Sorry. (Helicopter whirring, tracking signal transmitting) We are right over it now, Major Bourdon. Appears to be a large van heading for the London road. (Bourdon) Good. Then follow it until it stops. Report to me as soon as you land, over. (Knob clicking) Right. Now we can enjoy a little relaxation. (Dogs barking) ** (Dogs barking) ** (Barking, snarling) ** Hmm. I'm sure you enjoy a little hunting, my dear. I mean, one gets so bored With these eternal stags and foxes. Oh, don't distress yourself. I'm being very fair to you. You'll have one minute clear And then we shall follow you. Fun, eh? Right then. One minute from... now! (Dog barking) Action 69 fast! ** (Dog barking) (Exhaling) So then, a lot of Angvian girls appeared out of nowhere, Made some strange sort of signals And all Bourdon's men fell down in a heap. Well, that's going too far. It's absolute rubbish. You're cheating and making it all up. No. Cross my heart. ** (Zeta) Stand by, everybody. (Echoing) Action 69! (Loud beeping) ** (Barking) ** (Gasping) ** 46 seconds, 45... ** (Beeping continues) ** (Grunting) (Beeping continues) ** (Beeping continues) (Barking) Zeta, all fighters ready for action. Everything is prepared to go. Standby for word from me to proceed all forces to Bourdon. We must get Clotho out of there. 18, 17... ** 15, 14... 12, 11, 10... (Zeta) Lachesis, standby. Magnetic control field on. (Puddle splashing) Three... Two... (Barking) One! We're off. Actuate! ** (Dogs barking) ** (Engine revving, stopping) ** (Splashing) ** (Dogs barking) ** (Whooshing) (Whooshing) (Whooshing) ** (Dogs barking) ** ** (Dogs barking) ** (Dogs barking) ** Seen her? No. Right, come on! ** (Dogs barking) ** ** (Men encouraging each other) Right... come on. ** (Loud zapping) ** ** (Dogs barking in distance) ** (Swyne shouts in pain) Oooh, ooh, beast! ** (Dogs barking) ** (Zapping) ** (Zapping) ** (Zapping) (Grunting) ** (Zapping) (Zapping) ** (Electronic beeping) (Zapping) ** (Clicking) ** (Zapping) ** (Zapping) (Zapping) ** (Zapping) (Birds chirping) ** (Door creaking loudly) ** (Rattling) It's over... Hello, James. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. But what... where... It's all over. Over? Over. (Sighing) Too late as usual, James. Check channel red. Bourdon's men routed. Check channel blue. Um. What's the matter, child? Channel blue seems to be okay, um... (Chuckling) Oh, yes. Well, that just about wraps it up. ** (Anne) James? Hmm? You haven't finished the story yet. What, again? What happened to Edwina? Edwina. Well, she got sent back, memory eradicated. She's probably back in the strip club by now. So there you are. That's the lot. I don't believe a word of it. Don't you? Mmm-mmm. Well... Have a look at this. Is that them? Mm-hmm. How'd you get it? I took it. Is that the only picture of the Angvians in existence? I expect so. You're not going to show it to anybody, are you? Of course. I must show it to W. Well, perhaps these Angvians don't want People to know about them. I'm sure they don't. So why show it? Well, how else can I prove the story? Well, it's not as if they've done you any harm. In fact, they helped you. If they wanted the world to know about them, They'd soon make themselves known. Possibly. Oh, please. Don't show it to anybody. Please. (Sniffing) My God, the coq Au vin! (Coughing) (Electronic beeping) (Zeta) I think James Word is a danger. He'll always be a danger, as long as he knows about us. Is he virile, masculine? Then you know what to do. You know, I think he'll like that. (Electronic beeping) The coq's ruined. Who needs it? Unh! ** Viscosity 50? Yes. ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
