Alejandro Gal√†n... -You can go in now. -Is it a boy? No, it's a beautiful girl. Sir! Sir! Alejandro! Is he born? What's wrong? Is my son all right? Carmen...? Son? What son? It's a girl. Another one. Ami! Ami! Olivia's waiting for you. Go and see what she wants. There's nothing else. -A kiss. -A ''hairy'' kiss. Don't make any noise, your father's asleep. Why didn't you come? I'm doing things. -What things? -Drawings. Of what? Who for? Nothing for me... Thanks! Here, the butterflies aren't right. They're difficult. But this is beautiful! And is this me? Where shall I put it? There's hardly any room left. And Grandad? Stop it, love. This working by night and sleeping by day, would kill anybody. You'll have to put up with it. Things are tight now. They always be, with what they pay me. Forget about it now. Today's a holiday, so come on, relax a bit. I put up with it so as not to annoy Lucio. I can't complain, he was the one who got me the job. But as soon as things are a bit better... I'm through, right? At very most a year and that's it. I'm going to kiss Ami good night. Even that wasn't right. What? I couldn't even give you a son to help you. Don't say that. If we have a daughter it's God's will. It's all right. But a son... A father needs a man at his side. -Ami is clever. -She's bright, I know that. But once she's married, who'll remember your name? Or her granfather's? The less of him the better. -What? -Nothing. A name is not so important. What matters is to carry it with dignity. Well... I think so. My father had five sisters. They all had daughters. Not one man in the family. He says it's like a curse. He talks a lot of rubbish. Don't say that in his house. I'm going to see Ami. Aren't you asleep? You aren't frightened of the thunder? That's just angels playing marbles. Didn't you know? Or had you forgotten? I know, but they scare me. Angels can't scare you. Said your prayers? Did it fall over? Remember to pray. He'll look after you, even if it thunders. lf you forget, He'll punish you. If people prayed more, it would be a better world. We should fear God more, and respect Him. You understand? Well, come on. Go to sleep. Give me a kiss. Good night, love. Are you still scared? Come on, no storm lasts all night. Good night. She'll hear us. Come on... Amanda! Get out at once! Gabriel... -She was looking. -She didn't see anything. Are you sure? Yes, of course. What are you looking at? Nothing. ''The dark swallows will return on your balcony their nests to hang. And with their wings beating fast call to you. But those whose flight res... ..res... res...''. Silence! Study it again and then I'll ask you. Amanda! What? Do you know the poem? Yes, but I don't like it. I don't understand it. Is that for your son? Well, it's for my daughter. Why bring her that? Look, there are some dolls that are almost new. She doesn't like dolls. I'll bring her this. She's good with her hands, likes drawing and that. Turned out badly, did she? Keep an eye on her, or she'll be a lady lover. No, it's not that. She's got dolls at home. Why have you got the light on? Carmen? Are you sick? What's the matter? What happened? We're going to have a baby. What? Why don't you wait in the kitchen? I'm almost finished. Are you sick? I'm just a bit tired. Why not go out with Grandad? He's bored. What? Didn't you hear me? Go at once! I don't want to. He smells bad. Go immediately! You have fixed it? Well? Do you like it? And what... -What do you say? -Thank you. Thank you...? Thank you, Dad. Said your prayers? Not yet. Do not forget. For if you don't remember Him, He won't remember you either. Give me a kiss. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. What did your father say? -About what? -The baby. That it'll be another girl. It'll be what God wills. I said it wouldn't. I'd call it after him. -Alejandro. -That's not important. -What matters is his health. -But it is important. And Ami? What about Ami? What did she say? -Nothing. -Nothing? You know her, she never says anything. But is she happy about it? Of course. Of course she is. I'm going to put my father to bed. Mommy! Come here! What? I can't do the butterflies. It's impossible. Draw another animal, something bigger. A fish or a dog. -A whale. -I like them small. -Come and see. -Not just now. After I hang the washing. -Where is she? -Who? The child. I don't know, she might be in her room. Ami! You'll pull my finger off. Come on, silly, laugh. You're dying to. Give me a kiss. Don't be so stubborn! A ''hairy'' kiss. What a temper you have. Let's tidy up. You're very fat. I'm getting very fat. I'll end up looking like Goyi. Don't! When will you be back? At about seven. Waken me around four. Are you all right? -And Grandad? -Still in the room. -I'll put him to bed. -I'll do it now. He's nearly here, isn't he? There's not long to go. It mustn't happen when I'm out. It's not time yet. But Alejandro moves so much. He keeps kicking me. His name doesn't matter. So what if it's a boy or a girl! It's ours. Hush, she'll hear you. So what? Nothing, she... -...may be asleep. -So soon? Some chance! Does she ask about the baby? At times. She's still angry. About the scarf? Here. I'll go and say goodbye. -If she's not asleep. -Listen, say nothing about this. Children don't understand. And it's unlucky. Are you asleep? Goddam! Grandad... Grandad? I'll collect them all on Friday, so start now and they'll be ready on the day. Cut and stick... cardboard, colored paper. Draw something that is... presentable. Think of any object, any animal, any person. The postman, for instance. Olivia! What? What will you draw? A postman. Can't you think of anything else? A plant, a flower... No, what? A flower. And you can't think of anything else? Don't you like animals? Dogs? Have you decided? -A dog. -Very well. Olivia's going to draw a dog. Silence, silence. This work isn't for you. I want you to give it to someone else. Write their name on it.. Think of the person you love most in the world. Did anyone help you? It's lovely. Your mother will be very happy. Ami! Is Mommy sick? Is she dying? Why do you say that? She's fine. -Really? -Of course she is. I promise you. Mommy is very strong. Gabriel Basabe? It's a boy. Dad, it's a boy. Do you hear? We have a son. I know. And he's healthy. What? I'm going to feed the baby, don't come in. You heard? -Is Ami not back yet? -No, she isn't. Where's that thing I brought her? It's not in her room. It's there. She didn't bother with it. She's so tidy. -She doesn't draw much now. -She's getting older. -And more jealous. -What nonsense! -Jealous of what? -Of everything. -Women are like that. -She's got everything. None of the other girls do. But before it was just her. Madam is going to turn out spoiled. I'm going shopping. Don't let anyone in. Turn off the TV if you leave the room. And keep quiet, your Dad and Alejandro are asleep. I won't be long. -Hello, Goyi. -Hello, how's the baby? He's wonderful. Amanda! Where are you? Can't you hear me? Where are you?! Come here! What did you do? Where is he? Where is the baby? Where is the baby?! Tell me! Tell me! What's wrong? Shouldn't we talk to her? She won't come out. What for? You can't reason with her. She's like a mule. She'll forget it in a few weeks. We should say something. You act like it was normal. She knows it was a mistake. You think she doesn't? Well, she does. I'm telling you. She won't forgive me. She's bitter, like her grandfather. And her grandfather's daughter. Christ! Get out! Do you hear me?! l told you never come in when l'm here. Go away! You're not up yet? -What time is it? -Almost twelve. I'm not well. Another headache? A bad one. I'll have a wash. Then I'll lie down in the other room. Are you busy? I found this at... at work. Maybe you can use it. I'll leave it here. Thanks. I'm going to bed. If you remember call me at eight. Your mother isn't well, another headache. The dinner plates are still on the table. I'll tidy them up. Good, I'm very tired. Did you get the milk? I'll have some. Are you going shopping? Good night. The milk money? Well! Why the hurry? Drop by the house some day! I'll check your oil! So long. The milk? We're running late today. Would you hold the door, son? Angelines... Two bottles, right? What? Don't you like it? I just don't want to eat it again. What do you want to eat? No, nothing. This is fine. Do you want meat? A piece of ham? Well, if there were any... Of course there is. Go and buy some ham. What? Now? I'm waiting. For what? Forget it. I'll eat this. Go this minute. Do you hear me? It doesn't matter. I've almost finished. You'll go when I tell you. Carmen, that's enough. You'll get a headache. It's a lie. What? Your pains. Nothing hurts you. You go if you want. See? I've finished. She's going now. I'm fed up with her doing nothing. People like her are parasites. -You're a... -Ami! Come on. Do it. What? Can't you do it? Of course you can. You're the same. Carmen, please. She's just a child. A child?! She was never a child. She was born evil. Stop it! For God's sake, she's your daughter. I have no children. I have to kill you. Are you asleep? I didn't want to say anything, but I wanted to. You know your mother. You have to let her get over her moods. Some people you can talk to, others, you can't. Anyway, God made her like that. Remember how I used to tuck you in at night? See you tomorrow. Goodbye. Come on, don't be like that. No storm lasts all night. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. Maybe not. Maybe you shouldn't stay here. The milk. -You know how I am. -Shut up. -You know I'm sick, yet... -Just shut up. Shut away in your room... -You're like a slug! -Shut up! -You want to kill me! -Shut up! You're not going to do anything, are you? You are evil! You are evil! So far away. Good boy. Ami, who is it? Is it Gorka? Tell him to come in. Was the street hard to find? Not really. Who was that? Your daughter? Who, Ami? Yes. She's temperamental. Not on the head. I'm studying. Honestly. -Is your father here? -Wait a minute. I'll wait, if you take the sticks away. He's getting dressed. I'll wait. Got a light? It doesn't matter, I won't smoke. I'll send your father the doctor's bill. What? I have to see one after the fright you gave me. My nerves. Don't grow your hair. It's nice like that! Hi there, cutie. Well, she even laughs. He's almost ready. Come in a bit. A bit? Sorry, all of me has to come in. I just came to say hello. Know what? My flowerpot talks more than you. Don't go out looking like that. What? I had a friend half as pretty as you, and she got raped. It was a joke. Well, I'm off. I just wanted to say... you're beautiful. So long. So long. Hey! What do you want? Your father... What? He forgot his supper. -I don't know. -Take it to him. He'll be at the Cantones. -Look who's coming. -Who? Gabriel's daughter, the dyke. We'll have a laugh tonight. -Good night. -Hello. Looking for your father? -Where did he go? -I don't know. -What's it called? -Hi, cutie. Your dad forgot his supper? -Thanks, I was a bit hungry. -Where is he? He's over in Lizaso. I'll take you. You know Lucio? -Who? -The fat guy. Yes, he comes to the house. A pig. The problem with the job is the people. What about the garbage? It's great. You find something every night. I get everything from it. -Like you. -What do you mean? Isn't your dad a garbage man? Do I smell bad? Not yet, I've just started. Your father... Well, you're used to it. He knows about smelling. -We'll sit down. -I don't see him. He has to pass by here. See how I got out of doing my work? This is nothing. I spend entire nights accompanying girls who brought their fathers' supper. -What an idiot! -I do, really. -I guess he is not coming. -How strange. -We can go back. -I don't know... -Or I'll give it to him. -Give it to me. Give it to me, please. Really, I'll give it to him. I'll take you home. Fucking garbage! -This isn't it. -You never been here? That's odd. Everyone comes back. -Where are you going? -Like surprises? Come on. Gorka! Where are you? Know what we're going to do? Eat your father's sandwich. -Fuck! Omelet! -How can we eat it? Don't worry. I'll tell him you brought it and I ate it. What do you think of it? Well... It's a good place to be alone. Come on, sit down. Come on. Know what? I was hoping all night this would happen. What? That I'd eat this sandwich. It smelled great! Careful! You nearly squashed it. -So what? -It's dead... ''So what?''. Don't you like them? They are incredible. What are you doing? You're crazy! Fuck! What's up with you? -It's just a worm. -A worm? Why did you do that? I don't understand. Something lovely... Well... You're lovelier. -Shall we go? -Where can they be? I wouldn't have allowed it. -What? -If she were my daughter. You do as you want. What do you mean? Nothing, but just be warned. I don't trust ''the big one''. ''The big one''? Fuck! It's a nickname. My brother-in-law was inside with him. Where? Where do you think? In jail! Has he been in jail? -Tell me! -Well, he's not that bad. I know nothing. He was done for rape, things like that. Let's go. Wait a bit. Come on. Lie down here. -What are you doing? -Relax. Wait. -Stop. -It's all right. No, don't. -That's enough! -What's up? -I want to go. -Ami, it's all right. That's enough. Please, stop it. -I want to go. -Stop it! You can't go now. I have to kiss you. I can't wait. Come on, I know you want it too. You think I didn't notice. You've never done it? Don't be afraid. Just relax. Christ! Come here! Please, no. Dear God, let nothing happen to her. Bastard! Come here! Don't run, bastard! Take it easy, all right? -What's up? -Where's my daughter? What? Why are you picking on me? -Why did you run? -Why did I run? Fuck! You were crazy, like a mad man! What is it? -She was with you. -Right, she was! She left an hour ago. Mommy... Mommy! -Where will I put him? -In the room. Right at the end. Can you hear me? Dad, it's Ami. The doctors said you can hear maybe even understand. Can you hear me? Say something if you hear me. I can't take it any more. I can't even help you. Can you hear me? Move your hand if you understand. Tell me if you forgive me. Tell me. Goodbye, Dad. I love you very much. What? You're going out? Get some fruit and a bit of ham for your father. I'm not going out today. I'll be right back. Don't be long. And take care... daughter. What did you say? What? What did you say? When? What did you call me? What's up with you? What a temper! Come on, idiot. Give me a kiss. But a ''hairy'' one. Now, go on. I've to make two beds, hang out the washing, and feed the baby. He's not to cut the ham too thin. BUTTERFLY WlNGS
