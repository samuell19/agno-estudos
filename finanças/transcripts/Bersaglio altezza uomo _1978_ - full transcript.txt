I think this is the right time. We won't get another chance like this. If we exercise some prudence... ...we might even beat them. —Yes, I agree with you. Besides, it's all been arranged now... We can't go back. Let's just hope it all goes well. It's all been planned right down to the last detail... We just need some luck. —I have more faith in the organisation. You can't rely on luck alone. You'll need help. Right. We've arrived. Catch you later. —I'll be seeing you. See you rou nd. Slowly, slowly. Bring it in like that. Lower the anchor. —Hurry. Everything's okay. —Let's go. Welcome. I'm taking the captain's place, he had an accident. I don't care about the captain, I just want the cash. I've got it with me. Here. Perfect. You can start unloading. Get a move on. Okay. —Come on, let's get to work. You can unload it. I'll lend a hand, I should get back. What are you doing? He's making signals. We've been betrayed. Someone's coming. Everybody freeze. Seal off the area. —We've got them. No one can get away. Looks like it went as planned. They fell for it. —Everything okay? Unfortunately, the leader got away. We'll get him another time. —Get in the truck. Come and help. Slowly... These crates are like Easter eggs... They should contain a surprise. I don't think it's chocolate. —It could be special chocolate... The expensive type. Seeing as it costs so much. Why don't we try some? —It might not go down well. Keaton. —Yes? I'll start unloading. —Okay. But there's nothing here? Just women's clothes. And here's the powder. Check it. Exceptional powder... This heroin is very pure. —I knew I was right... Tidy it up. Come here. They could've supplied half of Europe with that load. We've got to get the bosses, not just the merchandise. One thing at a time. Did you already know? You're a gang of monkeys... Meet me at my villa. We need to talk. You're burnt out, dear. They won't forgive you... You're better of talking. That's not enough. I want the name of the boss. Who is the boss? —I don't know, I don't know him. I get the stuff from the vegetable grocer... ...and take it to Galata bridge. If they know I've talked... ...they'll cut my throat. Have you seen Zeke around? —Yes, he's in the shack. Thanks. Show me. —Relax, it's all there. Watch out. Run away. There's no way out. You're surrounded. Hands up. The arrests continue... The press are having a field day... They're singing the praises of the anti—drug police... They're the heroes of the day. Read it. This is all we need. Interpol as well. Aside from losing a pile of cash, they made us look like fools. It was probably that pig Gennari who was working with them... But that's not everything. Listen to this... "Who is the head of the organisation?" "No doubt it's an influential person able to use his position..." "...to protect the traffickers operating in the shadows." Bastards. We've got to do something. If they get to me it will all collapse. You know that, don't you? Yes, we know. —What kind of lawyers are you? We don't think it's so dangerous. —Is that all you can tell me? Right now, we just need to be prudent. —Prudent, my ass. I don't need lawyers to give me this advice... We need to do something. This Keaton is a great threat, we've got to fight back. I agree. We've got to deal with him first... He's very dangerous. We need to get rid of him. And as soon as possible. Take care of it... Talk to Schneider. Your woman is really something. They come from all over to see her. You'd better keep an eye on her. The owner's eye fattens the horse. Mind your own business. He thinks we betrayed him. Is it true? Yes, it's true. They don't believe it was a trap. They suspect you were working with that policeman. It's all your fault, asshole. —It wasn't my fault... I took all the precautions. No one knew about the appointment. No one? Then who told him? A travelling snitch? —I'll find the son of a bitch... I'll make him pay, believe me. —We'll take care of it later. If they don't trust us, we're finished. We have to prove it was the police. There's only one thing which might persuade them... I know, we have to kill Keaton. I have the right people... I'll take care of it. —Don't mess up. What long faces. It's like a relative has died. I've told you before, I don't want you involved. Get her out of here. —Okay. You heard, get out. Bravo, you're so obedient. A perfect waiter. Daddy. Can I see it? Go on, get in. I want a perfect manouver. —Yes. Start. Hi, mum. —Genghis. Happy birthday. —What lovely flowers. They're for you. Thank you, son. Dad, I'm going to stay outside and play with the boats. Yes, okay. I like to finish what I start. We only got to the small fry. We have to get to the top. To the people in charge... The important ones. —It's because they are important... ...it won't be easy. To force them into the open... We have to squeeze them. Make them scared... Get them fighting amongst themselves. That's what we're doing. Come in. Please excuse me, sir. We've identified the buyer... The one who got away. His name is Mandus... He's an ex—con convicted of robbery, extortion, blackmail and murder... Now, he's dedicated himself to selling heroin... He's part of a large organisation... He frequents the Torre nighclub, it seems to be their meeting place. I'd like to try and catch this galant man... It might be the right course. —Good luck. Right, to the Torre nightclub. I'm sorry, we're closed. I know, but I heard the staff here are really nice. Thank you. —I'd like something to drink. It's against the rules, but for you... —Good. I see you've understood. Do you know this man? —No, I don't remember him. Is this enough to help you remember? I'm sorry sir, it's not a question of money, I really don't know him. We'll say no more about it. She's good. —Yes, she's one of our best dancers... If you come back this evening you'll see her wonderful routine. I won't miss it. Help. Are you injured? —No, I've got a bulletproof vest. Here it is. Relax. Damn it. Let's get out of here. Did you see a bald guy run past? —Bald? Yes, he went in there. Let me out. —Go on, walk... If you don't let me out I'll kill her. Throw down your gun. Bastard policeman. I'll deal with you. I'll drown you. Police, everyone stay still. They'll stay still alright. They're all junkies. With all this smoke around, if we don't hurry up... We'll be on drugs as well. —That's all we'd need. Come, sit here. —I've been waiting so long for you. Yes, you're right my love. I'm not paying wife enough attention. Right. You know what we'll do? After the championships... ...we'll go on a nice holiday. A second honeymoon. Okay? Are you happy... I know you deserve it but I'm always so busy. You think about about the race too much. Yes, it's true but you are much more important... I couldn't live without you. Hi, dad. Don't make me go back to college. I want to stay at home with you. I told you, there are too many distractions here... You can focus on your studies there. You can learn to play the piano. Yes, I know but I'll study at home. I promise. You spend all your time playing football Don't be stubborn. Eric is just a kid, he's not being stubborn. Isn't that right, Eric? We'll talk about college later. Now go and wash. Okay. Stop cooing. Come to the table. Well? Are you coming? We're coming. —Fina|ly. Lucky youth. Does this one tell you anything? —No, no... This one? —Nothing. This one? I'm sorry. Take a good look. —I don't recognise them. Are there many left? I don't know anyone. Listen, you'd better try. The commissioner is waiting in archives. Do we have any new leads? Have a look at this. His name's Cayan, we know him well... He's already spent a few years inside. Cayan. Good... He's another piece of the puzzle. Get busy and try to find him. I wouldn't want to find a knife in my back... These people don't forgive. They'll kill me if I talk. Don't worry. We'll protect you... ...but you'll have to stop working. You understand, don't you? Yes, I know I shouldn't be seen around for a while, but how will I live? Don't worry about that. We'll take care of it... There's fund for informers. You've performed your duty. Good... They should all be like you. Yes, but there aren't many people who run the risk of getting killed... However, I've started the dance now, so I've got to keep on dancing... It's my profession. That whore identified me... Cayan is burnt. This could get dangerous... He might even talk. The police had better not find him. He can't say anything if they don't find him, understand? Yes, it's true. That's right. We've to get to Cayan before them. —It's not Cayan that worries me... Let's take care of Keaton first. —Difficu|t, he wears a bulletproof vest There's only one way... Shoot him in the head. We're going to need a specialist. Mr Genghis. —Yes? You have an appointment here at 5. —I remember, thank you. I finished that work. Do you want to check it? I'll look at it tomorrow. —Okay. I understand the championship is soon and you have to train... But I want those tickets on my desk by the end of the day. I'm sure you'll win the championship again this year, you're the best. Only if I train seriously. —No, it doesn't only depend on that... You're a natural. Yes, this is the place. Good morning. Police... We need to ask you some questions. I haven't seen him for months. I don't know where he's ended up. I should've know. Your friend is wanted... You shouldn't protect him. You'll be arrested as an accomplice. Give it some thought. How can you arrest me? I don't know anything. Look who it is. —You wouldn't want to kick me out? I wouldn't think of it. We're not discussing business. Not bad. What are you doing here? I came to see Ahmed. I heard the music... ...so I thought I'd do some training. You'll be waiting a while. He's on a mission. Then I'll be bored all day. What a pain. Why? You can go somewhere else. Not bad, am I? Is it your eyes or am I missing something? My eyes see too well, let's see if there's something missing together. Great You're a real champion. What did I tell you? The best around. It was only a lucky shot. Genghis, this is inspector Keaton, from Interpol You're a good shot. —Thanks. It's just a matter of training. Sure, training is important. That's why I'm here... You need to stay on form. —With a pistol? I find it very useful for the job I do. The inspector is also a good shot. —ReaHy? Let's see. Bullseye. Fantastic. I haven't seen many people hit it from this distance. If you were on our team we would be unbeatable. It was only a lucky shot. Let's a have competition. What do you say? It's better than training alone, right? I'm in. —What do you say, boss? I'm in as well. —Gentlemen, get to your places.... We'll begin. Good morning, may I help you? —Po|ice, we've got a warrant. Search everywhere. I haven't done anything, I'm a respectable citizen. We'll see about that. —That's expensive porcelain... I can have it sent to you. —Don't trouble yourself... There's no need. What's this? —Don't move. Heroin. Good. You're a hard bone. You really look unbeatable. You'rejust joking. Listen, apart from the firing range, where else do you work? I run an import and export company. Why? Put it down to the job. You're even. Come on, keep going. Shall we obey? God damn... It's the highest score. I surrender. Two bullseye's with one shot. —Put it down to the job. Can I do anything else for you? Shall I accompany you upstairs? This is what I'm here for. —No, thank you, don't worry. Calling all cars... A woman has been found murdered in the Macica quarter. Bad news. They killed the ballerina... They slit her throat. —Ki||ed? It couldn't have been anyone else. Cayan killed her. He mutilated her. A horrendous spectactle. We're ruined. We're not getting any merchandise. Get rid of that cop and everything will go back to normal... Schneider can prove he had nothing to do with the spy... He's taking care of it. —He's must succeed. I'm certain he will. His life means a lot to him. I'm not interested in his life. What about the cop? We won't get it wrong this time. I assure you. I can't go on, I'm finished. Worn out already? —I've got a lesson at the gym... You go on if you want. Don't fall over, you might hurt yourself. Yes, professor. —Not more than half an hour... You've already done enough today. —Very well, teacher. Where does he get the energy? Good morning. Do we know each other? —Who doesn't know the great marksman? This is what we came to discuss. —What do you want? Why don't you come closer? —We want you for a competition. What would the prize be? $50,000 That's right. That's a lot... What do I have to do? Let's call it a mission. I think I can guess. You've got the wrong person, gentlemen. Wait, Mr Genghis. You can't leave like this. Who's going to stop me? —You don't understand, Mr Genghis... I'll double it. $100,000 What will you do ifI refuse? Will you kill me? Not you... We'll see you again very soon. —And don't go telling anyone... ...it's not worth it. Especially the police. Remember, you've got a family. Finally. I was expecting it. Give a copy to inspector Keaton. —Very well. It looks like we're doing well. —It's report about the entire operation. The circle is getting smaller. From this report... It seems like the traffickers are moving up the river to the black sea. They're getting nervous. They know they're drowning. Sooner or later they'll have to come out... We'll have a better picture soon. Great. I didn't hit your car. It just rolled underneath it. Don't worry. You know I don't like being tickled. This time I'm going to slap you. Try it. Not the water. I'll get soaked. I got you. —Let go of me. What is it? Some guy wanted me to give you this package. For me? It's money. —Money? Where is he? —He's at the front. There's no one here. —He left. Shall I look for him? —Don't go too far away. What does this money mean? I don't know. It's got to be a mistake. They must have got the wrong person. I'm sure they'll be back for it. Wrong person? How can it be? There's no need to worry. This is will all get resolved. You're hiding something. I'm not hiding anything. I'm just as surprised. It can't be a mistake. That money means something. I'm sure it's meant for you. —We|l, if that's the case... ...they're very generous. Come on, let's go in. We should call the police. —No, just forget about it. Come on, smile. Watch out. It's dangerous here. No more than anywhere else. Hi. Can I help you? —Do you know him? Take a good look. No, I've never seen him. I don't know who he is. His name's Cayan. I heard you were friends. —I said I've never seen him. Yasmin. I usually go here. Get out, handsome. We've arrived. Come closer. It's a small world... Meeting people when you least expect it. Why are you quiet? Nothing to tell me? You're scum. I'll give you your money back. That's your money now. You're going to do this job... ...whether you like it or not. Don't mess around. We aren't very patient people. What do you want? Someone dead. —What? You're a skilled marksman... You've got to kill someone for us and I assure you you'll do it... Because you've got a wife, a mother and a son. That's enough. Get up. Good. It didn't take much for you to realise there's no other way... We need this guy dead and only you can do it... I'm sure you'll do it, champ. Open your ears and listen... You'll never be out of our sight. We will listen to all your phonecalls... We'll follow your every move day and night... One wrong move and someone you know is going to have an accident... I'm not joking, friend. Take him away. Listen, champ. Just wait for our call... In the meanwhile just enjoy yourself and it will all work out fine. You can go. Cayan. —Hi, Mandus... How's it going? Well. We've been looking for you... It's your fault we're in this mess. You shouldn't have killed that woman. She was talking to the police. I did it for you. What did they do to you? Just a little discussion. Is our boy at home? Yes, why do you ask? I want to know what's going on? I can't tell you anything now. Don't ask questions. —Why go on pretending? I'm desperate. I don't feel safe with that money... You can't go on hiding the truth from me... It's not right, we've always told each other everything. I'm begging you. They want me to kill a man. What? Kill? —Yes, it's like that... Unfotunately. It seems unbelievable... Something out of a novel. But this is the truth. But who? —I don't know. Who are they? —I don't know them... All I know for sure is that these guys won't back down... ...and if I don't obey, they'll hurt our boy. Let's go back inside. They cleaned the area before they left, there's no trace of drugs... This city has become a place where anything goes... It's clear they won't last long... Sooner or later they'll slip up... ...and we'll catch them. You promised you wouldn't send me to college. Please, dear. Don't be stubborn. Why did you change your mind? Is there something I shouldn't know? Nothing which concerns you, Eric. Just do as we say and trust us. I believe you, but do you love me? —A lot, Eric... You're the most important thing we have. We'll talk on the journey. You treat me like an old fool. Do you think I haven't realised you're hiding something? You don't think I'm capable of looking after the boy. No, mum. It's only for his studies. It will be as you say. Be careful. And don't think about non—existant things... Eric will return soon. Bye, mum. Can I make a phonecall? Hello? Police? —You'd better not do that... It could be dangerous. No, don't worry, our regulations take parental concerns very seriously. The children entrusted to us are under constant surveillance... They're never out of sight. Our staff are all trained in this area. I'm certain Eric will enjoy it here. Did you hear that? —I've got nothing against the college... ...but I wanted to stay at home. —It's only for a while. Do you believe me? —If you say so. I give you my word. I'm sure you'll understand one day. Why one day? Won't I understand now? It's not about this, at your age all you think about is playing. I trust you, dad, I know you've done this for my own good. I'm happy to hear you say that. One day, when I can tell you the truth... You'll realise we did the right thing. —You can count on me. Thank you. Do you like it? It's magnificent, if I'd waited for that fool Ahmed to give it to me... You're the right man for me. Let's make love. No, not now. What is it? You look worried... Is something wrong? —Nothing that concerns you. Things haven't been going as planned for a while. I can help you. I'll do anything for you. You're ambitious. It's normal. Most women are. Not like you. —That's real good... What a great picture. —Wait. You're a whore. I'll kill you. You're a just filthy bitch in heat. Deep down, he wasn't worth anything. Don't be like that, honey. I know, I shouldn't have told you a thing I'll give back the money and everything will be back to normal. Calm down, my love. I'm terrorised of that man. Don't be like this. Stay calm. We were so happy. I want my boy back. Let go of me. Go away. Forgive me. Try to relax. Everything will be okay. Genghis. What is it? —You're wanted on the phone. He's coming right away. Just a little more patience. I'm here. Hello. Who is speaking? I'm an old friend of yours. I've got a message from the boss. We have to see you. —Yes... You can go, mum. —Very well. I remember you. Where shall we meet? Tomorrow morning at seven. Is that okay? Or is it too early for the champion? —No, that's fine... I'm not interested in that deal. I want to give you back your money. We'll talk about it. That's your business... You can give back what you want. The important thing... ...is that you come tomorrow at seven, to the place I'm about to tell you. Great, Champion. You're on time. Here's your money. If you want to check it? No, we trust you. It's better like that. Come here, handsome. Look at this great gift we brought you. That's my rifle. They are our boats... Their microphone receivers are pointed at the villas so we can hear everything. We've got a land radio receiver also. —They're too smart to use their phones. I'm certain they'll make a mistake sooner or later... With all that equipment we will be able to trace them. Go on, imbecile. What are you waiting for? Shoot! Why don't you do it? Given you're shouting so much. But you're the champion. By the way, I forgot to tell you... I met your mother. She was going home... She looked very tired. You're making her work too much. Hold this for a moment. Stop, don't move. Give me the car keys. Let him go... We need him alive. Get ready. We've got to leave immediately. Where are we going? I don't want to leave you... I want to be with you. —Do as I say, it's dangerous. I want to take you to a safe place. —I'm not going anywhere without you. I don't want to leave you alone. They've killed her. Get in Aziz's car and lie down in the back... So they can't see you. Don't let them out of your sight. Get in, now. Let's hope they didn't see her. I'll make myself known. They're trying to shake us. Quick, let's go. Well? Do you want to get out of the way? You want me hit you? Fuck off. Come forward. He managed to lose us. —That idiot thinks he's smart. What shall we do? Shall we go back and look for him? Haven't you noticed anything? Keep going, drive out of the city. He's in the taxi. —What are you going to do? Teach him a lesson. We're still behind him. —I wonder what he's thinking. Here. —Do you want me to wait? No, thanks. You can go. Scum. "Remember, you're in our hands now. We know where your wife and child are." "If you want confirmation, go and look for him at college." Where are you going? You can't go in. Wait, sir. Sir... It's lesson time. It's not allowed. —Where is my son? If you had let me explain I would've told you... He left with his aunt. —Which aunt? He doesn't have an aunt. It's not ourjob to know if the kids have aunties or not. Can you at least tell me what she looked like? A young woman. Quite tall. And my son didn't say anything? I'm sorry, sir. He didn't say a word... ...but he was cheerful. He seemed very happy. Did he say anything at all? —I don't hear too well... ...but I think he mentioned Luna Park, the one by the piazza near here. Daddy. I'm up here. I'm so happy to see you. Why didn't mummy come? She told me to say hi. She's always talking about you. She couldn't come, she was busy. Come on, let's go and get a drink. Do you like it? Yes, a lot. This was a really nice surprise. —I'm happy. Are you hungry? —Yes. Would you like a doughnut? —Yes. Here. We can sit here. Let's talk for a while. Man to man? I didn't know I had an auntie. She's very nice... How come you never talked about her? You're right. We don't see her very often. I hope we see her more often, we had a lot of fun together. She even gave me a present for you. He can't take a step without you. —You can relax, don't worry. What's going on? Why don't you tell us? It's not the right time. I'll explain later. Be good, you'll have fun together. —Where are you going? I've got to go, I need to fix something important then I'll be back for you. You still trust me, right? —Of course, dad. Thanks. It's magic. My grandma taught me. Reading the future at the bottom of a cup of coffee... You can't go wrong. I'm not convincing you, am I? It will all work out, you'll see... Genghis isn't stupid. —You've very kind Aziz, thank you. I'll take care of it... You hide yourself. Next door. Who is it? —Your neighbour, I've got a delivery. You weren't at home. Good morning... I've got a package for you. It's from the gym. Stupid bitch. This one has been taken care of. It will serve as a warning. Let's get out of here, quick. —Hurry up. Hello. See how organised we are? We listen to all your calls. You dial a number... ...and we're ready to answer. We're eager, right? But the surprise isn't over yet, let me pass you to someone. It's your husband. They killed Aziz. My love. Help me. Don't worry about your wife. We'll show her a good time... She won't be bored. You'll see. Damn you. Let her go... She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go. Your husband is upset. Come on, let's show your husband what you're capable of. Bitch. Stay still, you. I said stay still. —He|p. Let go of me. —I'll show you... Why are you crying? Hello? Yes, I'm Keaton. —I'm a friend, Mr Keaton... I know you're looking for information about a certain Mr Mandus. Are you prepared to pay? —Sure, tell me. No, it's too dangerous. Not on the phone. As you prefer. You tell me... Where and when? —Tomorrow morning at Santa Sofia, okay? I'll be there. Recording ? — Perfect. Tomorrow morning at seven thirty in Santa Sofia, in the tower... Armed. It's illegal to turn left. Your documents, please. Take it. It's important. Act normal. We're being watched. Okay, sir. I understand. Put it in reverse. Go on. The plan is starting to work. We might just have them... They're starting to come out into the open. That certainly wasn't an informer. —Yes, I know. I understood perfectly. Relax, I won't fall into their trap. Let's go. Good morning. Inspector Keaton. He just left. Didn't you see him? I think it's very important. —I'll give it to him. Thank you. Good morning. This is for the accounts department. He shouldn't be late. Here he is. He's coming. Interested, sir? —No, thank you. Help me. Quick. In the car. Go slowly. Go. Great job. As you can see, it wasn't difficult. If you want your wife back, go to the Sultan's ruins in two hours... Everyone knows them. Someone will be there. You'll be free soon, madam. It's a shame, I was starting to like you Free? What does that mean? The champ has finally killed him. You're the real murderers. Your husband is the murderer. Fill it up. —Yes, sir. Can I have one, please? Is this one okay? That's fine, thanks. —It's all going well, what's next? I must be at the ruins of the sultan's home in two hours. We'll be there. Now, we can start again. They won't stop us this time... We must reunite the men. Reorganise them... You take care of it. About the wife and the champ... They know too much. Get rid of them. I'll take care of it. Goodbye. Fantastic. Come. He'll be arriving soon... Go and follow him. Hurry. You're so eager. Why all the hurry? It's an order from the boss. I've won his trust again. So you managed to get rid of that policeman... My compliments. I did what you asked... Where is my wife? —Don't be impatient, you'll see her soon We have to find out if you really are such an expert shot... A real champ. You're wife will be proud. Get your hands off and don't touch me. You're so touchy. Your car stays here, get in ours. Damn it. —What happened? We've got a puncture. Get out and give me a hand. I can't, I really don't trust this guy by himself. Where's he going to run? He came to us. Did it have to happen now? —Why? Is it my fault? Let's get a move on... This isn't a puncture, it's blown up. Where are you going? —You're surrounded, surrender. Throw down your guns. Just in time. Right. It all went as planned... You were smart to send me that message. It was the best solution.. For a while, I thought they hadn't delivered it to you. I had time to prepare for my own death.. ..and this is my blood. Bring the prisoners here. It's over for you. You've got nothing to lose... You'd better tell us everything. What do you want? We don't know anything. If we talk the boss will kill all of us. Would you prefer me to do it? Don't expect any help. Come on, where's the woman? If I tell you they'll kill her. —Tell me where she is or I'll kill you. Bastard, I'll kill you. —Leave him. She's at the boss' villa in the mountains Take them away. Calm down, I've had an idea. You could be useful, come on. Why are they taking so long? We've got the woman. She's more important. Why don't you have a look? I'm not feeling very relaxed. Do as she said. Did you hear her? See if you can see the car. —Okay. It's for the best. —Let's have a game. As you wish. I can never beat you. —Sure, I'm better than you. Where are you going? —To see if they've arrived. There aren't many of them. Good luck. This time I beat you. What did you do there? —What? What are you doing? Sleeping? He's dead... Help. The shots came from over here. Keaton. Hi, boss. Keaton is still alive... We've been found out. —Go to hell... ...and don't call me again. Over here. There's no way out. Drop the gun. We've surrounded the area. It's Keaton, I'll give you three minutes to surrender, there's no way out. It won't be so easy. I won't surrender... I've also got an ace in my sleeve. I'm scared. Take me away from here... Let's escape. Take me away from here. Get out of my way. —I'm scared. We'll stop here. There's no point resisting... You've still got two minutes. Look who I've got with me. I'll kill her if you don't let me go. Watch out. —Leave her out of this. I don't think so. Drop your gun. Tell your friends what's happening. Tell them. What are you waiting for? Move it. Listen to me, he's going to kill my wife if you don't let him out. You're all alone now. We can let you escape... ...but we'll catch you. You've got no way out. Do as they say. Surrender yourself. Don't try it. If you get any closer I'll kill her. I'm not messing around. I'll do anything I can to stay free... ...and your wife will be my passport. —I understand, but you'll never make it. That still needs to be seen. Don't celebrate victory just yet. Get your buddy to send a car. We're leaving... ...and you two are coming with me. Police. You're under arrest. You've got the wrong person. This stunt could cost you a lot. Your status won't save you this time... ...so I'll take the risk. Take him away. No, wait. Let them get some distance. Walk slowly, you. Stop. Bring the car. A squad car. Do as he says. Get a car ready. I'll go with you. —No, I want someone else. Don't waste time. You, go. Get it ready. Walk. Move it. Get in the front. Drive. The rifle, hurry. Calm down, beautiful. See? We did it. We're almost out of danger. Stay still. Take it. What are you waiting for? Shoot. February 2009
