FATHER AND SON Easy, easy... Calm down... lt's over, it's over... lt's over. You saved me. Saved me again. If not, they would have killed me. Killed me... Scream louder, next time. If I don't hear you, they'll kill you. Weren't you asleep? Not anymore. I... I love you. Yes... Where are you, now? I... I see trees. There's a path... a path. Are you still over there? The sun... Where is it? It's beautiful. Am I over there, too? No. I'm all alone. All alone. It's raining. Don't catch cold. It feels good. You should have dressed. I see the path, too. Yes... Now, I see you... We'd better go. They're coming this way. Come here! You know Alexei? He's second year. Send him over here. OK, I'll go. Go on, it's OK. Tell him his father is here. Hi, there. Go on! One, two! Show some spirit! Don't stop! Go on! What are you doing? Nothing. Hey, Dad! Sorry, they keep close watch. I know. They could kick us out. Did something happen? No. I just wanted to see you. And nothing more? What a smile! You don't look well. I'm fine. Just your imagination. My imagination? Go on. I don't want to bother you. Don't you want to watch practice? Let's go. OK. By the way... I saw your xrays. You don't have any spots on your lungs. You're in good health. Glad? I thought you'd be glad. I am. You know... They teach us how to read xrays. Go to practice. I'll come and watch. In a few minutes, OK? Well, I'am leaving. Have you seen Danilov? He's on duty in the barracks. That's a pity. What are you doing there? You can't stay there! You listened to everything? I heard your father. So you saw him? Yes. The exam's on Monday. Today is Saturday. Exactly. You could have come to see me. You're on duty. That never stopped you before. But... I asked you to forgive me! It's forgotten. I just needed to be alone. So why didn't you tell me? Why not? You always move ahead alone... Without me. Without me. I understand now. You're afraid of something else. Afraid your father thinks he's a bother. You take his side. Why can't I love both of you? Why not? I really need to go. You have someone else. Think what you like. With him... ls it better than with me? It's not the same. He's older. You're still a boy. You and I have the same age. Women are always older. Who? Women. I want to see him. What are you saying? What for? That's enough! Fall into pairs! First exercise! Let's go! Dad! Dad! The bag's here. It's my washing. Hey, there. Are you hungry? I ate at the canteen. Was it good? I guess it was. What's that? Your portrait. It's for scaring children. Scaring children... Why's that? It's still a photo. Just a little more revealing. You're not hiding behind clothes... Nor your muscles. That's clear. I think muscles are an exaggeration. What are you saying? You admit you worked out. You worked out... Where are you going? That was when I was your age. Alright! Where's my ball? Why didn't you change? Don't stay in your uniform! I don't feel like changing... You're the beautiful one. You're like a tree. Your legs are the roots. Your chest is like a trunk. Your arms are the branches... Sasha, have you eaten? Yes, thanks. Looking for something? I found it and ate it. Gotta go! On your way out? Wait! Where are you going? Got something to say? You didn't come by school today for nothing. I don't want to talk about that now. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Tchaikovsky... Do you like Tchaikovsky? Yes. You and me... We're so... different. You're the next in line. I'm behind you. So? That's your answer to all my questions? Not all questions have answers. You know what the saints say? About a father's love? The saints? Love? Have you been reading? Where? A father's love... crucifies. A loving son lets himself be crucified. I don't even get the meaning of that. Go to bed, OK. And change clothes, please. Kolya! Kolya! Kolya! Can you hear me, Kolya? If your son comes back here tomorrow... What should I tell him? Can I... show him these photos? Maybe give him this one? Dad I'm starting to forget your face. Dad! Dad! Dad! What? Where's Mom? Where's Mom? They gave us new uniforms. What about the tie? I have it. I had this dream... I almost killed you. Again? Someone thinks badly of us. Now I'm scared to sleep. Scared to sleep? Go whisper to the water. As if it's that simple. Try it. OK. I'll try. Troubles wash away with the water... Like night goes away with dreams. Like dreams with night... Dad! Water's boiling! Turn it off! Troubles... go with the water... Like night with dreams. Alexei! Your dreams are getting out of hand. I whispered to the water. Don't turn on the light. How old were you when I was born? 20. How old? Almost 20. Feeling better? What do you mean? You argued with her. Why do you say that? Does it show that much? Come on, get up. Yes, I need to get up. Back to the barracks on Monday? Do you have duty? Yeah. When are you coming back? I don't know myself. Come on, get up! On your feet! Go sleep in your bed. Come on, Dad. Get up. Remember I said I had an opportunity to leave? That the pay would be better? But me... I won't let you leave. I want you to be happy. What are you thinking? That I'll be happy if you leave? Don't lag behind! Run, run! Someone's at the door! Open it! Can't you hear? Open it yourself. I'm covered in soap! What's that? Dew? The roof is all wet. Yes, it's dew. But the sun's coming out from behind the clouds. It won't rain today. You sleep too late, soldier. Just go open the door! Alexei, who could be dropping by? You recognize me? Is it too early? Come in, come in. Yes, I recognize you. Put your things there. Thanks. I don't have much. Alexei, keep the doors closed! I was wondering if you would stop by. I've been waiting. Don't just stand there. Come in. Alexei, keep the doors closed! I'm glad you came. Actually, Mother and I are leaving today. Already? Well... Our three days of sightseeing are done. This city's beautiful. But living here must be tough. Come on, come on. I woke you both up. No, don't worry. Come in. Don't be shy. No. Where do we sit? How about at the table? Sit down. My same seat as yesterday. That's it. With the photos. Be right back. Are you hungry? No, thanks. I ate at the hotel. I have to dress. Of course. If you remember anything, tell me. Be right back. I didn't see this one before. Oh, yes, the helicopter... I saw it. Did it crash? I don't know if it's important, but... Can I sit down here? Sure. Thank you. I don't know if it's important, but... I asked my father one day why he and my mother divorced. I asked my mother before. But she told me to ask my father. He told me he had become another man after the war. Yeah, me too. And that no one understood him. I asked him to explain to me what he meant by "another man". He said I didn't need to know. That it didn't matter. Nothing to do with what happened. I'm just trying to figure out why he disappeared. Nothing is simple. Maybe he killed someone. Nonsense! Then where is he? Your father... is a good man. A good man. He didn't kill anyone. Even if he had, I'd stick by him. Are you cold? No. Yes, you're cold. He didn't do anything wrong. I'm sure. Yes. I know, I know. But there must be a reason. You must have some theory. Some idea... Some idea... You already know everything. Meet, you two! He came by last night, but... He's the son of my friend. Hi. My friend disappeared last winter. I didn't know that. I was in the military. When someone disappeared, we looked, we didn't write him off. But, like you, he left the military. You left the military too. OK, now it's my turn to talk to you! You didn't disappear! Don't bother him. Hey, hands off... This way! Where? In my room. I want to talk to you. Maybe I don't want to. Go on, move! Why did you close the door? Come on! This is my room. Don't bother him! Stop pushing me. Come on! Stop it! Is that your bed? Yes. Look at this. Are those ribs? It's a thoracic cage. My father's thoracic cage. Those could be anyone's. Very funny! Look at the lungs, not the ribs. Hey, I can't breathe! He had a lung wound. I want to know something. What's going on? I guess you don't know I came by here last night. No. Strange. Why didn't he tell you? He didn't have time. Are you really studying medicine? Yes, in the military. Military? Yes, a military trainer. Why the military? It's in the family. My father was in the military. That's beyond me. Too bad. There's my friend. Sasha, what's that music? Jakata? Don't blind me. ls that Sol? Alexei, come out here! I know, it's Next. I'm coming out. Next? No way! Don't you know music? I'll knock you down! Give me that CD! Don't be afraid! Sit down! Hey, Alexei! Alexei, stop it! I give up! I give up! Who's that? A guy looking for his father. I can't get rid of him. Bring him out here. Go on. Get away from here! Go on! Alexei, don't or I'll fall! Come here! Come on! Come on! What for? Come on! I'm trying. How are you doing? Hold on. That's it. I'm standing! Don't hold me. Let me go! Stand on your own. Are you afraid? Nothing compares to my father's disappearance. I know you don't care much. Hold him! It's good not to be afraid. Don't be afraid. I have no pity for those who fear. Strange... Listen to me! Never be afraid of anything! Never! Not of anything. Got that? Alexei! What do you want? You made him go out there. Why? Tell me! Come back in, you two! Me? Come on! And you, why did you go out there? Now, you. Hurry! Did you hear me? I'm coming. No need to shout. Hurry up! What have I told you? I know. So? What? Why do you push me? Just because, right? Then you get what you deserve. What are you doing? Nothing comes from nothing! I'll teach you once and for all. Next time, I'll beat you! Alexei! Don't just stand there! So you're here, too? You like playing acrobat? I've got him, Alexei! Help me! Whose side are you on? I'll help you! Will you go back out there? I can't breathe. Do you give up? Will you go out there again? Idiot! Come on, guys. Stop it! What? You tore my tshirt. Go back to your nest. Mend it! You're no match for me! You tore my tshirt. That's it. I'll get a needle and thread. You'll mend it! Just throw it out! What about lunch? Don't count on it! What are you up to today? Why? I need to talk to you. Today? I'm leaving tomorrow. A little later, then. I have an appointment. Let's say in an hour. How's that? OK. Tell your father I said bye. In an hour... Keep it down! Alexei, where's your cat? I already told you. Get off my back! I'm not interested in you. Dad... I'm sorry. Sorry. You knew about his father, didn't you? You lied to him. You can't hide it. Tell me. It's true. I can't hide. In 1998, my friend received orders. A dangerous mission. All the soldiers were killed. Only he survived. He came up with this crazy idea... to kill the guy who gave the orders. Actually... it's not crazy at all. I know exactly how he feels. It's not crazy at all. He wanted to kill the guy who gave the orders? Who was he after? Do you know? He didn't say. It's the man at the top. The one who decides. You two were tight. You saw him. You kept his secret. He chose you. He knows we have a house... Knows he's welcome here. We fought together, but he wouldn't come here. Why not? I'd really like to meet him... See what he looks like. Really. So, should I cook? Not now. I'm late. Late? On a Sunday? I promised him. Who? Our guest? Alright, go on. That's where you hid the ball! Bad hiding place, I guess. Over here! I already told you! Don't play ball here! Did you hear me? Go or you'll be late. Get dressed. Careful with him. Don't say too much. Alexei! Did you hear me? Don't come home too late. I'll cook for us. Did you hear me? Hey! You're late... Where are we going? This way. I played ball with my father. I'm training him. You, training him? This city is made of hills. We'll have to go up again after. This way. That dog has barked from that balcony since I was a kid. Nothing changes here. Let's hope it stays that way... Great door! It's just old... Come on. Look, a plane! I wanted to talk. All we're doing is walking. What's that over there? Come back and see us next summer. Next summer? Look, the tram. Hurry up! Stop! It's quicker this way. No need to shout. lt has to stop. Let's go to the back. Hey, Alexei! I want to speak about my father. Your father? OK. Hey, Alexei! Tell me. OK, but... Where do I begin? He gave me a key. So I could see him now and then. So I would be there when he came home. He wanted me to. But I never used that key. Now I realize how he needed me. I don't get it. Didn't he live with you? Mom chased him away. He started drinking after the war. Why did you let her chase him away? How is a man chased from his home? This is a strange city... Where are you taking me? Somewhere in the past. Let's stop, OK? OK? Let's stop? I'll call you. Stop, please! We're getting off. It's dangerous. I don't advise it. See you soon! This way, to the right. This way! Can I ask you something? Go on. Your mom? What does she say? About my father? She doesn't love him anymore. Too bad we don't live in the same city. Look... That bird is looking for someone. You know the parable about the prodigal son? Rembrandt... ln the Hermitage... Yes. Why the son? It's really the prodigal father. The son always knows where he has to go. And why does he know? Because he only has one path in front of him. If you say so. There's always someone with us. But the father is ultimately all alone. He survives everyone. Those aren't your words. Neither your ideas. Yes, you have a father. But I don't even envy you. Go on, go home. I'll go to the station on my own. So, that's it. You're late. What? We didn't have a date. I can't take it... Tell me who he is. Does it matter? But... But what? I had no choice but to leave home. So I did. You never told me that. Yes. No. Yes, I did. No. Yes, I did. Take off your chain. What? Take it off. What for? Give me your chain. It feels warm. That's all that remains. I had so many dreams last night. All of them... strange. First, I dreamed about my father. Then, about our son. Our son? Yes. Really. What did he look like? I didn't see him. I only heard him. I heard him moving about. But you didn't want a baby. You were always so careful... lt's not your fault. Your time hasn't come. Your time hasn't come. A father's love crucifies. A loving son lets himself be crucified. Yes... Give me back my chain. Come on, hurry... Hurry... Poor crucified boy! Crucified love means you can't be equal. You're not brothers... Are you hungry? No. It's ready. You eat. You eat! I waited for you. I don't want to eat. I saw him. And? I showed him the city. What did you tell him? I invited him for next summer. Is that all? Yes. He thinks his father is alive. He loves his father. Do you have a headache? Do you think he's alive? Of course. It's your intuition. That's a new one. I'm serious. When you were 4... Stop it! My childhood doesn't really interest me. I didn't need my own life then. Everything was about you. Without you, I was nothing. Every story has two sides. Now I'm just a bother to you. Don't say that. It's what I think. Then don't think. Dinner's ready. You might as well eat. Let's go outside. It's better outside. But I made your favorite. Come on... Where are you? Come out, Dad! Come out here! Come on! lt's better out here. I'm coming! She said we built a fortress. That we don't let anyone inside. So is this our fortress? Yes, this is our fortress. I don't remember what grade you were in... Your friends hardly ever came by. That worried me. You seemed bored. But I never felt alone. I had you. She said she's tired of banging on our door. I see everything differently now. What she thinks, what she wants... I'm not interested. She never understood me. So I don't need her. I've almost forgotten her already. Do you believe me? If you believe, so do I. Come here, Dad. Come here! Stop it, you're not a kid. Squat down. You're not a kid anymore. When I graduate, I'll leave here. If ever I see her, I won't recognize her. You'll leave here? I guess I'll be alone. You won't be alone. You'll get married. Alexei! Sasha, not now! I'm flying! Higher! The army doesn't feed you. Careful! Again! Next time. Next time... You... You won't be alone. You'll get married. I'm glad you said that. Sad about something? Did it really mean that much to you, what I said? You look... so much like your mother. God sent you to me. Everything about you is important. Sasha, come here! Me? Come here! Sasha, come here... Hi. This is my father. And this is my friend. I love him very much. I love him very much. Take me into your home. I'm a nice guy. Yes, Sasha, you're really nice. You want to live with us? Don't be sad. You live right next door. We're already together. Together... but next door. It's cold... Very cold. I should go. Where are you going? You know very well. Where are you going? For a walk. I can't sleep. I'll go with you. No, I'll be right back. I'll go with you. I feel bad. Yeah, I see that. I feel bad. Something here... hurts. You'll work it out. You'll work it out on your own. Will this happen often? I don't know. To you? I don't know. If you're human, all your life. I understand. Very clear. Very clear. It's snowing. You... Where are you? I'm not far away. And me... Am I there, too? No. I'm alone.
