The time to fight back has come, climb over that wall Like a lighthouse, ignite the light of hope That enormous strength is precisely what leads the way to freedom Let's look beyond this conflict, Ausfall! Inside the wall, with no place to run, we're stuck in restrictions and exploits Even if our glory days of youth get trampled upon, I want to at least hold on to the future I won't give in to that absurd scolding voice, either I pledged to the earth that I'd make our dreams and hopes come true The time to fight back has come, the blood in my veins calls forth the future We'll pull apart all those troublesome rules Now's the time to raise the flag of revolt upon that steep wall Seek prosperity, Ausfall!
