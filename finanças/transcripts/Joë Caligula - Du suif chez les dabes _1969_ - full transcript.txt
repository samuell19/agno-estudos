They must have had inside help. Don't we know anything about them ? - They're lost at sea for us. They know. They'll act. I swear on the Madona that I'd rather die than give up to such trash. Only hate makes people clever. Camus said so. That fat girl who's always near you ? - Who ? - Ariane. She's my Adriane's thread. She is a great help for my jobs. Well... little sister...
