... it therefore appears to be evident that, when the defendant, Josselin Beaumont, arrived in Malagasy on the 14 th of May, he had the full intention to make an attempt on the life of Colonel Njala, President of the Republic of Malagasy. lt is hard to believe that the defendant claims to be acting in his own initiative, Mr. President. You admit to coming to Malagasy for the sole purpose of killing President Njala? Yes, Mr. President. Are you aware of how deplorable such crime is? Yes, Mr. President. And you were not subject to any political manipulation? Are you aware, Josselin Beaumont, that l'll have to set an example with your punishment? Defendant, answer the Attorney General's question! The defendant will rise! The defendant needs to be excused because of the heat. The session is suspended until further notice. No, no, no, no! No more of that! You're driving me crazy with that stuff! Hey, what's wrong with you? Come on. Don't be difficult now, come on. l don't want anymore of that! See? Be reasonable, come here. Very well, put his clothes back on. Let go of him, now. Well, Mr. Beaumont... Perfect, excellent. Let's continue where we got interrupted. l'll have to set an example with your punishment. Yes, Mr. President. There we go, good! Do you think you deserve an exemplary punishment? Yes, Mr. President. Make three copies for me, one for the President's staff, one for Matignon and one for Colonel Martin, so all our friends can read it every once in a while. Yes, Mr. President. We are reporting live from the courthouse, where Josselin Beaumont's trial is presently under way. lt seems that only the President's grace can save the terrorist from capital punishment. Everything depends on the infinite compassion of your Excellency. lf we want to gain the sympathy of the French, Beaumont must be a very sick man, so we'll have to teach him a thing or two. Up, get up, pig! Get up! You bastard! Hurry up, get out of here, they're coming! The soldiers are getting closer! Get out, get out! Don't stay here! Hurry, they're coming. Ready? Almost. They're coming closer. Don't shoot! We'll sneak out through the back. Okay. No! Am l going to die? Yes... are you afraid? No, why? Because l would be. That's because you'd go to hell. What does ''Ludo Koda'' mean? That's the signature. Oh, okay. Captain Valera. We got this strange telegram, could you come up for a second? l don't understand any of it. lt doesn't seem like any of the codes we're using. Where was it sent from? From around the corner. lt looks like the code we used in Africa. That's really weird, you know how long it's been since we used those codes? More than two years, Captain! Who would use a code that's two years old? Someone who disappeared for two years. Well, we'll know more when we put it into the decoder. Hello? Hello, Alice? Edouard. Am l bothering you, were you in the bathtub? No, l just got here. Excellent, then you can just get into a taxi and come over here. Alice, did you hear me? Yes, Edouard. And hurry! Why? What's going on? Nothing good, hurry up. Yes. Joss Beaumont to Colonel Martin. Go call the colonel! - Call him, where? - Anywhere, and do it now! This is not funny! Joss Beaumont is back! Bravo, he's very strong! So what does it say in this telegram? One second. lt says that the contract will be fulfilled between the 12th and the 15th. The contract between the 12th... The 12th... starts in an hour! And let me remind you that President Njala will be in France from the 12th until the 15th. That's why we didn't hear from Beaumont after he escaped. l'll be right with you. Call Rosen, from our special section immediately. And tell Alice Ancelin to stay, she might be useful. And call the guy from the shooting school there, he could help find Beaumont, What's the name of that brute again? The instructor, Picard. That's it, Picard. And above all, find the Minister for me, will you? l want to be covered! Understood, Colonel. - Captain Valera! - Yes? Put Joss Beaumont's wife under surveillance immediately. lsn't it a crazy idea to go there? And the telegram, that's even crazier, don't you think? Sure, Colonel. Maybe we should let his wife know. What do you think l'm doing? Somebody's on the line with her right now. Hello, surveillance service-- Can't you give them a few minutes? Jeanne, dariing, you'll be under surveillance very soon, so we won't be able to talk. No, Joss, don't hang up! Please, Joss, come here! They'll probably come to your place. As soon as they're gone, you close the shades in the living room, and l'll come see you during the night. What, what is it? l'm clean, l took a shower last month! All right, yes, where's the truck? Oh, you're not the police? What time is it? What do you want in exchange? - An associate. - What? An associate to do some business for me. Are you aware, Josselin Beaumont, that l'll have to set an example with your punishment? You are a monster, Josselin Beaumont. Obviously! And you were not subject to any political manipulation? Yes, Mr. President. Josselin Beaumont, are you aware of the recklessness of your plan? Gentlemen. Good morning, Martin. Thank you for coming, sir. l have to rest a little bit, l... Do you have coffee? Of course. Alice. Yes, sir, l'll bring some. l hoped for a good night's sleep, l've been sleeping terribly lately. l took a sleeping pill. Did l ask for some coffee? Here it is, sir. Thank you. So, l'm all ears, Colonel Martin. Josselin Beaumont is in Paris. Who's that? Commander Josselin Beaumont, an agent of the Special Action Service, He came back after two years of captivity. His return is causing us major problems. Why is that? He wants to kill President Njala. Njala? Kill Njala, but why? lt's not easy to explain... Well, we... how should l put it? Because we gave him the order to do it, two years ago. Who's ''we''? Your predecessor, sir. Marchadeau? Yes. Philippe Marchadeau? Yes, sir. l can explain his political motives-- That's not necessary. What happened exactly? Well, we sent Commander Beaumont to Africa. You've already told me that. Miss, would you give me a little bit of coffee, please? l'm listening. When he arrived in Malagasy, the political situation had completely changed, there was no more need to kill President Njala. Of course not! So, did you call Beaumont back? No, sir. Why? Would you like some cognac in your coffee, sir? l'm asking you, why you didn't call him back? Well, because we considered it appropriate to inform President Njala of Beaumont's presence. You sold him! No, sir, not sold, we gave him for free... for governmental reasons, usually that means for free. Let me introduce you to my associate. He'll explain everything about our business to you. We'll walk around together and l'll tell you what to do. What do we get out of this? Yeah, what? Ask my associate. Don't worry, you won't regret it. He's an honest guy. Can we go? Okay, yeah. Let's go. Hey, slow down, we're not athletes! l'd really like to know why he sent this message. Why? Look at us, sir, this is only our first sleepless night. There'll be many more. What are you planning to do? Whatever it takes. Ha l lt's not gonna be a piece of cake. lnstructor Picard, he's the one who trained Beaumont. That's the worst part of it, sir, Beaumont knows all the tricks. And why? Because we taught him every single move, every clever turn. He was my favorite student, sir. lf l had a son, l'd want him to be like Beaumont. That's very touching, but it won't help us solve our problems. lf he's that good, it'll be very difficult to stop him. Still he'll have to move around, contact some people. Unfortunately not, l taught him how to be completely self-sufficient, to operate in enemy territory. Whatever the circumstance, he's got the ''white ones''. Huh? lt's a term used in chess. The white ones have the benefit of the offensive. He'll always be one step ahead. He'll pull some amazing tricks on us! He'll improvise everything. He'll know where we are, he'll drive us crazy! Beaumont won't come here. The whole night we'll sit around for nothing. lf you were free tonight, would you go see your wife? No, l'd go see yours. Very funny. Go ahead! You dirty bastard! - What's this? - lt's a bunch of bums. They seem completely drunk. Go, for God's sake! They stole my cognac! My cognac! Follow me! Get lost, you stinkin' drunks! Get out of here! Help me, you idiot! l can't, l'm stuck! Go, out of the way get lost! What's this? lt's my alarm clock, for when l take my little nap. Go, get lost already! on a little boat... Hey, my alarm clock, my alarm clock! Maybe now is a good time to have a little coffee, isn't it? Yes, you're right. What is it with this shitty neighborhood? lt's a shitty neighborhood, all neighborhoods are shitty, and it's not gonna change because they put a little bit of green in it! lt stinks like the gutter here. Gentlemen, l find you to be very pessimistic. Remember, Beaumont had to first go through brainwashing, then two years of brutal treatment in Malagasy, and finally the difficulties of his extravagant escape. He's probably weak and tired. Weak and tired? On the contrary, the Biribian regime had to invigorate Beaumont. He'll be at his best! Let me tell you one thing, sir. There's a lot on the line. l mean, if the politicians don't kick him out soon enough, then, boom! No more blacks! Enough! Thank you, Picard! Wait, l'm not finished. Thank you, Picard! Gentlemen, after that brilliant thesis, let me tell you this: if there's no more blacks, there's no more service, and no more Minister. Boom! The whole worid would blow. No, we'll get him! We'll stop him. Stop him? Who will stop him? l will. lnspector Rosen from the lntervention Bureau. Joss... ls that you, Joss? Two years! l almost went out of my mind waiting for you. Jeanne, l've hurt you so much already. l don't want to give you fieas on top of it. The guy who gave me this coat hasn't seen soap in years. One minute of tenderness, hours of itching. Did you tell Alice Ancelin that you're back? Forget Alice Ancelin, it's been two years... with expiration today. l haven't forgotten. And l'm sure she hasn't either. Now l'm here with you, aren't l? The service called me just two minutes after you did. Valera. He told me about the telegram. Why didn't you come here before you sent it? lt was the telegram that triggered the surveillance, the searching the apartment, the roadblocks downstairs. Why did you do that, Joss? Did you come here to see me, or to play with them? Your return, is it for love or provocation? Valera told me you want to kill Njala, that you went crazy! l couldn't stand losing you once again, Joss! l love you. l don't like them, Jeanne. They've killed a soldier named Josselin Beaumont, he was killed in ambush, years ago... You can imagine, it took a lot of explaining before they sent me down there, before l would slide their guns into my suitcase. They told me that Njala was a monster, that he had to be killed, that it'd be an honor to do it. l had foolish conceptions about honor and pride back then. l was so wide-eyed and eager. l hate them, Jeanne, and l want them to pay for what they did. ln the beginning, Valera came every Sunday, then every other Sunday, then every three weeks. Then one night, he came and said to me, ''l'll resign.'' The papers had just announced your trial and your condemnation. His resignation was refused, but he handed it in. Yes, he did. At what time does the concierge throw out the garbage? Around seven, seven thirty. Put the bum's clothes and the alarm clock on top of the garbage, so that it is cleariy visible. Why, what are you gonna do? l'm leaving. They'll certainly pay you a visit. Hopefully it'll be Martin, in the worst case, Rosen. He's a bastard, but a great cop. He'll definitely come to bother you. And then? Then he'll leave. No, l'm talking about the two of us. Listen, Jeanne, right now, there is Njala, Rosen, Martin, the four of us, the six of us the twelve of us. As long as all these people are involved, there'll be no such thing as the two of us. Hello. Edouard? Joss. l'm at Jeanne's, but l won't be for much longer, 'cause l can smell Rosen's arrival. Why Rosen? As if you didn't know. lt would be better if you came. Why are you calling? You know we're being tapped. lt's illegal to tap people's lines, isn't it? The noise you just heard was birds sitting on the cable. Be a good boy, come here. The concierge brought out the garbage. l put your stuff in just in time... Joss? Joss? So, Mr. lnspector, now you're a garbageman? Tell Rosen to come immediately. Beaumont was here. Tell the others, too, ask them if they noticed anything. How did he do it? The bum! Where is he? Where is he? l not gonna ask you fifty times! He's gone. l'm warning you, you better not mess with us! So, l just found the clothes in the trash, and the alarm clock. l recognize it, l know it was him. So, for the last time, where did he go? You're making a big mistake by not telling me anything. Rosen's methods are a lot less pleasant, believe me! You won't get him, anyway! Bitch! Farges, Rosen is coming, l'll get him. lt's on the sixth fioor. Good morning, lnspector. Morning, lnspector Farges is waiting for you upstairs. Bravo, my compliments, Farges. He came and left again and all that right in front of you! Then again, l understand you well. You were waiting for a nervous officer by himself, instead you see a group of bums drinking and singing. One thing has nothing to do with the other. You're certainly right, lnspector Farges... Assistant lnspector Farges. So, get lost now and lift all the roadblocks. He won't come back. Very funny, the alarm clock in the garbage. Are you gonna tell me when he left now, or what? Who? Miss Beaumont, please, when did he leave? l don't know. Where is he now? l don't know. Where are you going to see him again? l don't know. l think l'm losing my patience. Don't get carried away, lnspector, there's no point. She's protecting him, she can't help it. lt's love, passion! lt's nobody's fault, really. You're certainly right, sergeant, l shouldn't get carried away. l beg your forgiveness, Madame. See, he apologizes, that's how he is. You might become good friends if you tell him the truth. l'm sure you're gonna tell me. When are you going to see Beaumont again? l'm not sure that your friendliness is very effective. Sure, we're getting along just fine. You'll tell me, won't you? The whole truth. You'll tell me the whole truth, l know you will. You're looking pretty good, giri. Beaumont must have been more than happy to see you again, after two long years! Your eyes look like you didn't get too much sleep tonight. l'm sure you two were having fun last night, a lot of fun... fun... fun! After a night!ike that, you must want to take a shower, a nice warm shower? No. A warm shower, and then a cold one and then a hot one. No l l'll soap you from head to toe. You'd be surprised by what l can do with a bar of soap. l'm begging you, stop playing these games. Miss Beaumont, l cannot remain in the room with a naked lady. That would be against the regulations, wouldn't it? Sergeant, you take care of Miss Beaumont. lf that's an order, lnspector. No use in screaming. Rosen couldn't care less about what l'm going to do with you, as long as l make you talk. And if it helps to find this son of a gun, Beaumont, He won't even care if l rape you. You'll see, it's very healthy l And good for the blood circulation. That's what they do in Sweden. Afterward, they spank each other... Do you want me to spank you? Oh, you're so cute. All right. Oh, she's soaking. Rosen, l'm always right behind you. You knew he was there, didn't you? l'll get him yet, l'll get him! Oh, Edouard! You know, Rosen, now l know how we can find Joss Beaumont. We'll follow you everywhere, my friend! Because the day someone puts a bullet through your head, Joss won't be far! That was smart, now you have no more coffee. Leave it. That's for me. l didn't want to hit her, l swear. Rosen had me do it. l didn't want to hit you either, but my wife asked me to. Come on, commander, it's my job, l hate to slap people. You're right, that's your job. lt's your job. The croissant is on my friend there. And he'll stay for three days. That's a long time, a very long time. Not for us, we're hoping to trade a part of his reserves for a nuclear plant with immediate access. Three days is no time at all to be able to convince him. Right, but it's more than enough time to kill him. Your Excellency, l'm sorry to disturb you, but-- That's all right, Arthur. The colonel of the security, Martin, wants to see you. l'll receive him after dinner or tomorrow. Your Excellence, tomorrow you have a meeting with the President of the Council. lt'll be a busy day. Well, in that case, l won't see him at all. lt must be very urgent, your Excellency, he's waited for more than an hour. They let me wait fifteen years, Arthur, and for the most part, in prison. One little hour certainly did him no harm. Gentlemen, his Excellency can see you now. This way, please. How are you planning to handle my protection in this case? We understand that this palace can offer great comfort and the neighborhood certainly is a very pleasant one, but right now, l'm afraid it is not the safest place for you. Too many come and go here, and it is hard to keep track of everyone. As far as safety is concerned, this is a disaster. Please, tell me if l'm mistaken, l hope you don't intend to lock me in my embassy. Of course not, Mr. President. We would have never even thought of such a thing. Does your Excellence need anything else? No, thanks. So where are you planning to keep me? Luckily, there's many castles in our country. Unless you're talking about the Senate's Palace in the Luxembourg gardens, l am afraid you must be referring to one of your giant isolated castles in the country, where your kings died of boredom. Oh, l'm sorry! l thought you were alone. Miss Frederiksen. Hello, Miss. Doris, my love, what do you think of the French countryside? Yuk! You heard it, reason dictates what politeness forbids. So long, gentlemen. Good evening. - To you, too. - Thanks. Shit, another one. So, what's the first question? Doris Frederiksen. Having been faithful to his Excellency for years now, she recently began an affair, very ltalian and passionate. You got it! With whom? Volfoni Salvatore that's the ice cream and soda Volfoni. Correct! And where? ln the Hilton Hotel. l can even tell you where to reach Miss Doris Frederiksen. Wrong! 2250563, under the name of ''Miss Claude''. One wrong answer and you lose everything. You're good, though! Please hold, l'll put her on the phone. lt is Madame. Madame who? Madame. Hello? Hello, Doris? Yes, is that you? ls four to five tomorrow good for you? That depends on who it is! l have the black man coming tomorrow at seven. Salvatore Volfoni. Ah, Salvatore, that's different, at the Hilton? Suite 1056. Oh Claude, send this to lnspector Rosen. Doris Frederiksen? Yes. lnspector Rosen, from the savage squad. Someone is planning to kill President Njala. l thought l'd warn you. How does that concern me? Let's say you're the president's weak spot. The killer will try to get to him through you. ln case he contacts you, try to keep him there, and call me immediately at this number. Two of my men will follow you for a few days. You're not even asking for my consent? Your consent? l couldn't care less. And what if l refuse? lf you refuse, you'll have an accident, for example, in the elevator. The cable will snap, and they'll find you six stories down with your stiletto heels up your throat. See you soon, mademoiselle. Yes. Mr. Volfoni, the ice-cream-and-soda man? Yes. Joss Beaumont, espionage and ass-kicking! Does it amuse you to follow me around like this? We're not doing this for fun, we're working. Where are you going? To work. From here on, it's private! - Who is it? - Doris. l'm coming. Good boy, stay there. Oh, l'm sorry, this must be the wrong room. ls this 1056? lt is. l have to apologize. l came with no notice, impromptu, even a little shameless. Salvatore didn't tell me that we'd be three. l don't have a problem with it, but-- Three, Salvatore, ah, good old Salvatore. Where is my head? Yes, he's in the closet, next to the ties. Which closet? l should have specified, this is a suite, after all. l never lie. l hope he won't get too wrinkled. l didn't have the time to put him on a hanger. What sort of behavior is this, to lock people into closets? l needed to see you privately, alone. l heard a lot about you. From whom? The black man. Would you happen to be the delinquent that this furious cop was talking to me about? The furious guy, did he give you his, ''Rosen, from the savage squad, l'll make you eat your shoes''? He didn't say my shoes, he said my stilettos. What does this brute want from me? Rosen? He'd just love to kill me. But in order to do that, he needs to catch me, and in order to catch me, he's counting on you. And you, what do you have in mind? Do you really want to kill Njala? Would that cause you a lot of pain? Well, no, that's not the point. But if you put one half of my sugar daddies in the closet, and kill the other half, l'll end up with nothing to wear! Well, that's just an expression. Listen, let's make a deal. You can keep Njala for a little longer, long enough to get a maximum of money out of him, and in exchange, you'll do me a favor. A favor? Yup, you'll tell Rosen that l asked you plenty of questions about Njala's safety, the number of body guards, the placement of his bed, his habits, that kind of thing. How does that help you? Rosen won't be able to sleep at night. And when you don't sleep, your hands start trembling, your head becomes clouded, let's say it could be to my advantage. He asked me to keep you here and call him. And you think that's amusing? No, l was just thinking that l wouldn't be so against the thought of keeping you here... without calling him. Where is that lunatic now? Talking about espionage and ass-kicking. Work is calling. l won't say anything. l won't say a word or ask any questions, but get out! What are you doing here? l am responsible for this, and l'm leaving. Pierrot returned to Columbine on tipped toes goes the hariequin You can't walk out like this, there's two cops outside. Are you nuts, they'll jump right on you! lt doesn't matter, l have what is called ''the surprise factor''. Some couscous with chicken anyone?l First, Mrs. Beaumont, then the presidential whore, soon enough we'll be the only ones in Paris who didn't meet Commander Beaumont yet. My congratulations, gentlemen. Excuse me, Colonel, but l can't keep an eye on Mrs. Beaumont, on the presidential whore and the five miles of hallways at the lntercontinental at the same time. The lntercontinental is no longer safe. We're moving the President somewhere else. Don't you remember how he reacted to this idea? Because it was ours, now it's the higher-up's. Where are you going to put him? ln the Ferriere castle in the countryside. Two towers, one main building, one story and a pavilion, with a great view. - And Beaumont? - What about him? Well, Beaumont, should we stop him or shouldn't we now? Of course we should! Why are you asking? l'm not asking you, Colonel, l'm asking Valera. You're sick in the head, Rosen! l think l know what you're getting at. What are you interrogating Valera for? l'm not interrogating him, Colonel, l'm just asking him whose side he's on. Our's or Beaumont's? Just a question! lf l remember correctly, you and Joss were very close friends, weren't you? What are you trying to say? l'm simply saying that if someone he trusts, like Valera, asked Joss Beaumont for a meeting, he'd come. lsn't that a good idea? You're even sicker than l thought! Well, the previous maneuvers weren't successful. l'm trying something else. The other tricks didn't work out, so you invent another one, preferably one that's even more deceitful than your last. No, Alice... a meeting is not always a trap. Captain, l think lnspector Rosen might be right. ln any case, if anybody meets with Beaumont, it will have to be you. All right, l'll try to contact Joss. But l want you to promise me something. Give me enough time to convince him, or at least to try. Of course we will, Edouard! lsn't that right, Colonel? Obviously! Edouard, how can you say that? You know them, you know very well that they want to kill him. That's their only purpose, their only desire. That's why l want to see him. He's gone too far, Jeanne. He has to cut this bullshit out! lf l can't make him understand that tonight, it's gonna be too late. Well, l can't promise anything, but if Joss calls me, l'll tell him to meet you, but only if you swear that Joss doesn't have anything to fear from you. l swear. That's good, Valera. Really good job, Edouard. Y'know, you're cute when you pretend you're sleeping. l'm not pretending, why do you think l was pretending? Two years, Edouard. Two years, what? You were gonna ask how long it's been since we saw each other. Two years. l know that it's been two years. What's so funny? Because l'd like to see Martin's face if he saw us together now. l mean, you can always hand in your resignation. They won't accept it anyway, so there's no risk. Did Jeanne tell you about my resignation? Yes, and how it impressed her, which isn't surprising. l can literally see you telling her, ''Jeanne, l resigned this morning.'' Just like you told me not so long ago, ''Joss, l would love to be in your place and go.'' You're good at these kind of scenes, you know that? Do you have some coffee? lt's ready, l'll get it. Speaking of Jeanne, do you think it was really necessary to go to her house and see her? Her house, that's funny, don't forget l live there, too! Oh, look, the ''Condor lnterceptor''. Didn't l bring you that from Hong Kong? Yes. lt wasn't your robots that drove me crazy, it was your batteries. German batteries don't work in Japanese robots. Batteries from Brittainy don't work in robots from Auvergne. How's Alice? Fine, why? Did she decode my telegram? Yes. Did she think it was funny? Not, really, no. She would have preferred to have heard from you before that. Me, too, actually, everybody would have. How many do you have now? What? How many robots do you have now? Oh, more than a hundred, a hundred and fifty, maybe. A small army almost. And cops, how many are here, around us, everywhere? Also a small army? l don't know, but there are a lot. We have some on the roofs, in the unmarked car, there's Louviers and Farges. You really put him in his place. ln the back there's Ropert, Dugoineau and Perrin. Down there, at the corner of this building, there's Vittoret and Goulet, ln the cafe, Martin and Michalon. Why did you come here if you saw them? Because you asked me to, Edouard. l wanted to see you to make you stop before it is too late, Joss. They'll shoot you like a dog... and what for? Things have completely changed in the last two years, the political circumstances changed. And... l've changed, everything has changed. Except Njala and the Service. And if it was good to kill Njala then, it must still be good now. Well, maybe it wasn't good then, either. Then you shouldn't have convinced me that it was! l don't understand your stubbornness, Joss. l'm wondering, who do you hate more now? Njala or the Service? Guess. Enough of this... how am l gonna get out? On my feet, of course. Maybe you could give me the password, now that you've put spies all around. Joss, you don't understand. lt's over, no more, finito, hopeless. No, dear Edouard, it's not over. lt's overdue. What the hell is this? The press, the democratic press. They haven't written anything about me in two years. So l suggested they do a follow-up. What, what did you tell them? What did you say? l told them they could have live coverage of the execution of an agent of the Secret Service. They were more than happy! Are you out of your mind? That is against all the rules! ls it in the rules of the Service to sell one of its agents? And the call you made to Jeanne this morning, is that part of the rules, too? Hey guys, thanks for being on time. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, l'd like to inform you that l'm in good health. l just came back from my vacation, l have plenty of friends, and therefore no reason to commit suicide. l'm saying this so you know in case you find me lying on a doormat. l just need to walk down two stories to get to you, so l'll see you in a minute. Why are you doing that? Because l have to walk downstairs with my back to you. Joss! That bastard! Block the doorway. lf you mind the light, turn it off. Whatever you like, Colonel, l can either use the main entrance, and answer all the questions that are being asked, or l take the back door and you call your men back. Take the back door. ln that case, l want a car and nobody around, got it? Call back Ropert, Dugoineau, and Perrin. You, Louviers, bring a car to the back entrance. All right. There you go, that's much better! l didn't think Edouard could convince you. lt's just a scratch, it's nothing, but it's bleeding like crazy. Thank you for sending me fiowers. You see, Alice, l ran and ran and ran, and l had a plan that l was not to forget on the road. As soon as l arrived in Paris, l knew the odds, Colonel Martin's smile, the fist of Valera. You don't call him Edouard anymore? No, l don't call him Edouard anymore. Valera's fist, the irreproachable Jeanne, the wonderful Alice, in short, all the reasons why l couldn't do what l had to. That's why l sent the telegram, so that all these reasons wouldn't exist, so that my craziness would be irreparable. A guy's allowed to change his mind. My point exactly. Even if l did, what for? The machine already started running. There's just screams, orders, targets. There's only two targets, Njala and me. l must admit, l wish there was only one. Eariier the door, now the window... Do you really think that anyone would be sick enough to look for you here? l know two sick guys, Rosen and Farges, especially Rosen. What if we both left, what would Rosen find here? Well, there's a few things we could do, we could make plans, take an airplanes, and get out the sunscreen. But unfortunately, today's the 15th, and l have an appointment at a palace in Paris to kill a president. You're right, it's the 15th, but you no longer have an advantage on the others. ln fact, you have a disadvantage. Your president is not in the palace anymore. He's at the Ferriere Castle, five miles outside of Rambouillet, in Yvelines. By now they should be digging pits, putting bags of sand up. What is it? You seem surprised. Did you think they'd give you an update? Are there many of them down there? Well, the cops, special squads, Rosen's bloodhounds, oh, and a pilot! A pilot? Yes, l think they're planning to have Miss Doris Anderson come there. Frederiksen. Right, to have Miss Frederiksen come by helicopter. There you go, that's what we should have started with, my dear Alice... the helicopter! l'm sure l'll hit him, l'm positive! Where can he go? l'd know if he was in the hotel. l'd know if he was at his wife's. He doesn't have any friends left. Listen, you take care of Beaumont, and l'll go keep an eye on the President. Farges and Valera are there already, at the castle, l'll join them. Poor Valera, l feel for him. Colonel, Miss Ancelin is asking to be excused. She won't be able to come in today. What's wrong with her? l don't know, she doesn't feel well, she's tired. Overworked, maybe? Rosen. l told you l'd always be right behind you. Excuse me, gentlemen. Do you know where l can find Dr. Touchard, please? l looked at the... the apartment listings... l came to leave these. Well, l'll go to ask at the front desk for that information. Excuse me. No l.D. Hello, hello, no l.D. Just dog tags under the name of Commander Josselin Beaumont. The first reports say that the officer was killed by a bullet. Oh, shit! He was wearing dog tags with the number 322460, registered under the name of Josselin Beaumont. The first reports show that he's been killed by a bullet. l don't understand how he could fall into such a trap because a direct confrontation is unthinkable... by a bullet. l'd like to meet whoever did that! ls that all it says in the report? lt also says that the body is at The lnstitute for Legal Medicine. By the way, tell Colonel Martin that l won't go to identify the body. That's his business! He knows how l feel about this. Calm down, l'll tell him! We knew this would go badly, didn't we? Why was he so stubborn? Okay, Farges, you're off to Paris. Go to the morgue to identify Beaumont's body. Yes, what is it? Your Excellency would like to know if all the measures have been taken concerning the helicopter for Miss Frederiksen? What the hell should l care about his stupid whore? Yes, yes, everything is ready. He just needs to whistle and she'll land on the lawn. So, is that good enough, Arthur? Yes, very well. lsn't all this going a little too far? We'll send all these people back to their normal posts. The regular service is more than enough to protect this whorehouse. Oh, my god! Hello? Give me Colonel Martin, immediately! Hello, Colonel? Hello, Farges, hello, Farges? lt was me that you saw laying on that table. Hello? Colonel... l did identify Beaumont, it was him. What's up, Farges? Your voice sounds funny. l liked Beaumont. Well good, see you in a bit. Let's go! l didn't believe Rosen when he told me he had hit Beaumont. He's a strange cop, that Rosen, a real ass, but what a cop! Meet me at the office. l'll give the good news to his Excellency. What time will the helicopter with the giri land? Three-thirty, why? Because we'll make plans according to that. Relax, lnspector, relax, isn't it nice to be driving? Breath in, it smells like springtime! When we pass the gate, try to look as natural as you look dumb! You hear me, natural! See that, the Colonel's sending his men home. The path is clear. Don't forget what l told you, natural! Now you're pushing it, that's almost friendly. Thank you! Stop in front of the entrance stairs. Where are the president's rooms? Do you want to end up in a freezer like Rosen? Where are Njala's apartments? First fioor, opposite the stairs, the large windows. The helicopter, does it land in front of it or behind? There, on the grass. Wait. Hello. What are we gonna do now? My respects, Colonel. Beaumont. So, who was it at the morgue? Rosen, disappointed? Rosen, yes, very much so. l was just saying what a great cop he was. Oh, but we're all great guys. Now, if you could just hand me your weapon, with only two fingers, just like on TV. You don't know how much pleasure it gives me to see you in such a picturesque palace for this, the final act of our drama. lt was Njala who arranged it, so we should go thank him. Go ahead. You can leave us now, Colonel, you have other things to do. Go listen to Farges' explanations and excuses, put your elite hitmen on the roof. ln other words, the usual calm before the storm. Tell the Minister, as soon as all that shit is in place. Come in! l would love to chat a little longer, but you never make his Excellency wait. Don't turn the light on and above all don't speak, Arthur! l'm not Arthur. How can l help you, Commander Beaumont? Open the curtains, turn on the light, and die, Mr. President. l can see the corner of an office and make out a silhouette. They just turned a light on. ls that a signal, or what? l'm sure the President had the clever idea to make the other idiot stand in broad daylight, so l can kill him with one shot. Farges, you should know if it's him. You just saw him at the morgue, where he was dead. l told you that l had a gun pointed here. Do you know how that feels to have a gun right here? That's not like invoices or reports, or numbers. lt's a gun! The curtains are open, can you see anything? lf l see Beaumont's gun peeking through the curtain, l'll shoot. How much more time do we have? You, about ten minutes, not more. And quite frankly, l don't see any reason why you should live any longer! My country needs me! No country needs a tyrant. Word of your death will trigger joy among your people. They'll dance in the streets. They'll burn you in effigy under the coconut tree of freedom. There'll be no regrets. l have one, the regret of not having killed you. That l really regret! l often ask myself why l didn't do it. Maybe for religious reasons? No, l think l saved you in order to trade you in one day. But for what? You don't represent any value to me. That's exactly what misled you thus far, your system of values-- the good, the bad, the kind, the evil-- in short, the general concept of values. Here we are, and we're heading toward the most simple solution. Unfortunately, for you, it's the final solution. So, what are you waiting for? The helicopter. l'm not asking you to take a message! l'm asking you to put the Minister on the phone! Let me speak to the Minister, Miss! You're something else! lt took you French three revolutions and five republics to achieve some semblance of democracy, and you want me to achieve it in one day! l don't care. l don't want to hear all this chatter about ethics, morals and comparative history. l don't give a shit. You see? Even your cleverness won't save you now! Call them! What's going on? l don't know, l don't understand, something's going on. Yes. Captain, it's President Njala. Hello? When we come out, we don't want to see anybody, not on the stairs, not in the hall, not on the lawns. And the helicopter has to be ready to leave. And the helicopter ready to go. Give me Beaumont. He wants to talk to you. Hello? Hello, Joss. We may never see each other again. Why not? lnvite me over, it's always a great time. ls there anything l could say to make you change your mind? l can't think of anything, but l'll give it a thought, l promise. Go ahead, let's get it over with. Get it over with? Okay, but l never intended to kill you. Oh, really, so what's that in your hand? This, it's empty, Mr. President. l can see his gun. l don't understand anything anymore! You will very soon, Mr. President. l got him! l'm telling you, l got him! One second, Mr. Minister. No one moves, wait for further instructions. Hello, Minister? President Njala is dead. No, lnspector Farges. No, no, it's not a mistake, it's some sort of a scheme. Everyone stay put and wait for my instructions! Are we being tapped? Of course, Minister! Don't shoot! No one moves without an order to do so! l am waiting for your order. There's a helicopter ready for takeoff, and Beaumont is going to take it. Of course, so what should l do? Colonel, do whatever you think is necessary. l don't know anymore, sir! l'm out of it now. My resignation will be on your desk before six o'clock. So, what are you going to do, Mr. Minister? What can be done? Well, we can kill him or let him leave, but that's up to you, now. What's going on here? Rosen is dead. Njala is dead. And they're deciding my fate as we speak. Come to Paris with me. No. But if l were you, l wouldn't stay in the line of fire. Minister, we only have a few seconds. Well, there's a criminal aspect to it, but also the political aspect, especially after the comments that Beaumont made to the press. Well, shit, what am l gonna do? We have to stop him! ls that an order? l'm ordering you to stop him! Farges, we have to stop him!
