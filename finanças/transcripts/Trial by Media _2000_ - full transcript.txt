Hi, I'm Greta Hewitt, and today on "the focus," can your sex life get any better? Are you kidding? Can it get anyworse?! Woman: You ready? Visiting is spicey klinger, the author of "a dummy's guide to orgasms." [ Chuckling ] Spicey, welcome to "the focus." I understand you've brought some toys with you. I've got here a couple of vibrators, and we have a chocolate bundt cake... What are you guys watching? W-Where's the remote? It's the third-highest rated morning show in the country. Don't you want US to be part of American culture? Not if you're late for school. Now, go. Go! Come on, chop-chop! Hurry up! ...in your local mall. I have chocolate. I don't need sex. It's a naughty book, isn't it, spicey? It's healthy! It's a veryhealthy naughty book. And there's some protein in here someplace. Hey, you forgot your lunch! Bye, guys. Love you. Mom, you forgot to wish me good luck on my test and kiss my forehead. Good luck! Bye, mom. Bye. Mom, don't forget to blink twice for me, okay? Okay. Bye. Bye, mom. [ Horn honking ] Hey, guys. It looks fantastic! Dr. Hughes! I'm surprised to see you here. Hey, Wilson. Just checking out my mural. You know, we really miss you around here. Yeah? No pushy broad to boss you guys around? No one with as much sense to push US around. Oh! I love it! It's great. Look at that! Man on radio: The president is expected to nominate his next candidate for surgeon general at a white house breakfast. Following the death of surgeon general Dr. David burns in a plane crash, and the defeated nomination of Dr. Charles mcdermott, the president is under pressure for a swift confirmation process. His new candidate, Dr. Hughes, is scheduled to accept the nomination this morning. Good morning, everyone. I am absolutely thrilled to be here. And so, as physician to the nation, I will be in a unique position to further this administration's goal thatevery American, male or female, adult or child, will have access to the best healthcare information. Our greatest protection is prevention. [ Applause ] Dr. Hughes?Dr. Hughes? Uh...yes? Terri anzer, tribune,Washington bureau. Hi, Terri. When your father was the republican whip, he consistently voted for anti-choice legislation. How does that affect your relationship? One of the reasons my dad and I get on so well is that we both know that democracy means conflicting opinions. Man: Dr. Hughes? Yes? You come from a distinguished political family, Dr. Hughes, including being a descendant of ulysses Grant. Is it also true you're an old friend of the president's? Yes, as a matter of fact, I went to Bryn mawr with his wife. My husband, Walter, and I have been very fortunate to have their ongoing support. What do you do for fun, Dr. Hughes? Go to the dry cleaner. [ Laughter ] Congratulations on the nomination. Thank you. Secretary Gutierrez. My husband, Walter abrahmson. Oh, I loved that book of yours. What was it called? "Towards a lesser elite." It really summed up the '80s. Thanks. I've got to go. Would you excuse US? Certainly. Bye. I am soproud of you. If we weren't married, I'd hustle you right into the Lincoln bedroom. Oh, Walter, we don't have that kind of moola. Bye, honey. Have fun. Dr. Hughes, congratulations. We're all very excited about working with you. Oh, thank you. You are amazing. You're so superwoman retro-chic. I loved that crack about the dry cleaners. I loved that. [ Laughs ] Thank you. Excuse me. You know, you're much different than I expected. Am I? I thought you'd be sweeter. Sweet women are really very angry people. They're trapped by their own repressed hostility. Has Walter left already? Yeah, just a second ago. Tell him I said hello. You are... I thought you recognized me. I'm Quincy quince. I wrote "the prisoner of gender." Oh, of course, you're my husband's celebrity student -- "rebirth of feminism." "Sexism made simple." Right. We saw you on "conan o'brien." Most of Walter's students don't make it to late night. Was he expecting to see you? Not at all. I'm in Washington doing book signings and talk shows. But I can't wait to get back on the air and talk about meeting you. Oh, say that I'm not so nice. Say that I have... Bite, okay? How many times have I told you? If your name is in the papers, it's an open invitation for any crazy on the street to waltz right into the white house and crash your nomination breakfast. Happy new year, honey. A little early, honey. Okay, then happy high holidays. Sorry I'm late. There were two African-Americans at the Washington Hebrew congregation today -- the rabbi's chauffeur and me. And when that rabbi blew his shofar in front of the entire congregation, I said to myself, "Judith, next year in Jerusalem." [ Laughs ] Shh! Judy! Hi. Quincy, meet my oldest friend, Dr. Judith b. Kaufman. Quincy is Walter's star pupil. She wrote "prisoner of gender." Oh, of course, Quincy quince, the next generation of feminists. Are you ob-gyn? No, I'm the other kind of woman's doctor -- oncology, breast cancer. But it's possible I could have specialized in something women don't have, like heads, necks, or throats. Lyssa? Yes? Tom Reynolds, from the president's press office. Hi, Tom. I spoke to your father this morning in Antigua. Do you have a minute? Yeah, sure. Excuse me. So, how long have you known lyssa? Oh, we went to boarding school at miss Porter's. We were in the Gilbert and Sullivan society together. Really? That's so impressive. You know, my mother always told me a woman's life can have no boundaries. Will you excuse me? I need a little air. Should I get lyssa? Are you not feeling well? Quincy, time will teach you that a woman's life is all about boundaries. Hey, guys, have you heard of timber Tucker? Isn't it that reporter who ran away during an air raid in the Gulf war? Oh, I liked him. He was always wearing a gas mask. Now he's got this show called "time zone ii"? You mean, one wasn't enough? They're all descending on my house for brunch on Sunday. Even dad's coming back from his honeymoon early. Oh, this is going to make reallyboring television. Judith, you know, if I have to explain to timber Tucker over pancakes that gun control is really a health issue, it's worth it to me. And if he wants to watch me pick up my kids from soccer practice so that every woman in this country is guaranteed reproductive freedom, it's also worth it to me. And I happen to know it's worth it to you, too. It's worth it to all of US. I hope timber Tucker knows that. I'd be happy to talk to him about you from a younger woman's perspective. Women's issues are my priority. You hear that, lyssa? The rest of US can relax now. Quincy, I'm sorry. Maybe you should come to lyssa's for brunch Sunday. Oh, you have not had brunch in Georgetown till you've tried lyssa's homemade scones. Oh, I can't believe you make your own scones! Yes, and I made all the muffins this morning from scratch. Are you sure you want to share this important time with me? Absolutely. Come to brunch. I'm sure Walter will be delighted to see you. Will you be there, too? Yes, yes, yes. No. I have services. Do you go to one of those churches with a gospel choir? Judith is Jewish. Her father was a very famous freedom fighter. And a not-so-famous Jew. He met my mother in tuscaloosa, Alabama, but I was bat mitzvahed and confirmed in Brooklyn, New York. Quincy, I am 100% kosher. Wow. Someday, I would love to talk to you about being black and Jewish. You're a walking crown heights. Quincy, we usually do brunch around 1:00. I'll work it out. Sucha pleasure meeting you. I'll be having a wonderful life because of you. It's a pleasure meeting you, too. I hope you feel better. Why would she be having a wonderful life because of me? Why did you have to invite her to brunch?! So good to see you. Could have stopped me. Yeah, right. But I think you're curious to know just how good a mentor Walter is these days. Besides, it's no use. I felt guilty. I was awful to that girl. I behaved like a cow -- an old, bitter, envious cow. A-a-a-ah, nope, nope. Let it go. You'll buy her a pony tomorrow. Come on, I'll drive you. Man on radio: A Harvard sociology professor took 20 hostages at Boston's regal seafood restaurant yesterday. After a 10-hour siege, Dr. Blumberg handed himself over to the Boston police. The hostages remain unharmed. Dr. Blumberg told authorities he wanted to call the nation's attention to the hypocrisy of brunch. I envy him. Oh, stop. No, really. I'm going to regal seafood tomorrow. [ Sighs ] Oh, I regret my life, lyssa. What are you talking about? You're a remarkable doctor. It's just possible this could be a very good year. Yes, and it's possible there's a pill that makes white chocolate mousse the same calories as raw fennel. I wish. It's even possible that sperm catalog specimen 1147 will scramble up a few eggs with a nice Jewish, African-American doctor. You're not working on the high holy days. You're going in for another cockamamie fertility appointment, aren't you? You've been doing this for five years, Judith -- every in vitro and hormone treatment known to modern medicine. You're a good doctor. What do you think all of this is doing to your system, not to mention your mental health? It's ridiculous to regret your life. All lives don't have to be about children. How would you know? Judy, Judy, Judy, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. You are the onlyperson I know who dares call me "Judy." I hope, more than anything, that this time, one very clever spermatozoid takes a look at your eggs and says, [ deep voice ] "Hey, there, cutie." You know, you have broken one of my basic rules. What? Sometimes, decent things dohappen to decent people. I could kill you for that. Well, you better get used to it, sweetheart. Wish me luck. [ Smooching ] Good luck, good luck, good luck! [ Harp music playing ] Hey, no, no, no. I'm warning you -- you shouldn't smoke. Come on, now, you're not the surgeon general yet. Hi. Not yet. Have I told you I'm desperately in love with you? I met a friend of yours at that breakfast this morning. Who? Uh, your student miss quince? Quincy's in town? Where's she staying? I have no idea, but she's coming to brunch tomorrow to meet daddy and some reporter who's doing a piece on the family. Excuse me. Oh, wait, a piece on the family? Nice to see you. Lyssa, did you invite morrow to brunch tomorrow? Why on earth would I invite morrow? Well, 'cause we're gonna go jogging. He always comes over afterwards. Do you really want morrow at our house with that reporter? Why not? Because he's gay? No, don't be ridiculous -- I lovehim! It's just his new antiabortion stand is not exactly how I want to represent myself. [ Laughing ] Well. Hi. Good to see you. Besides, he happens to be the hippest young journalist in DC. Fine. When I launch a hip-hop newspaper, I'll invite him. Oh, come on. Now, Sally Quinn and Kay grimm would be thrilled to have him at their brunch. Besides, with morrow in our home, no one would notice that you're a commie, pinko, pro-choice, cuckoo. Morrow makes you look positively middle-of-the-road. He's your right-wing alibi. I don't know. You've been surprisingly silent this morning, Walter -- no opinions on world or local news, no nominations for whose Sunday column you could have written better. Did you hear about that Harvard professor who took hostages at the regal seafood restaurant? That must have been some really badclam chowder. I knew the guy. He's a very respected sociologist. He must have just totally lost it. God, that's depressing. Won't happen to you, Walter. You take too many vitamins. That's true. I better get back before lyssa gets back with that reporter. Are you sure lyssa wants me there? Of course, you're family. I better change. I might get lucky. Everyone says timber's gay. It's impossible. He's a war reporter. I know. Mr. Tucker, this is one of the steepest slopes in Norway. No man or beast has ever mastered it. Can last year's olympic champion do it again? The fans are going wild! Can he make it? Yes, he can! All right! Excuse me. Dr. Hughes... I saw you yesterday on c-span. I just want to tell you, I told my daughter, "I want you to grow up to be just like her." What's your name? Ida johnston from west Lafayette. This is timber Tucker. Oh, I remember you from the Gulf war! I didn't recognize you without your gas mask. Cut. Guys, you can set up in the garden. Carmelita will show you where. Oh, Walter, I'm glad you're here already. Aren't you glad i'mhere? Yes, but you're always here. Timber, this is our friend, morrow McCarthy. I miss reading your column in the post. The president doesn't, and I'm happier working on my screenplay. I don't believe lyssa mentioned me. I'm Walter abrahmson. Would you like a bloody Mary? Sure. Okay. Where are the kids? We dropped them off at Donnie's. They wanted to surf the net and download who-knows-what. Is this the portrait of the general's wife you mentioned? Yes. That's Julia dent Grant. Ulysses wrote to her every day during the war. Lyssa's named after her great-great-grandmother. "Yes, my family is American, "and has been for generations, in all its branches -- direct and collateral." First line from the great "unconditional surrenders" memoir. Walter, was your family also in the civil war? A different civil war -- the one in Minsk. Morning, all. Dad, hey, welcome back! Hi, chubby. Hello. Timber: Senator... Timber... Do you know my beautiful bride -- Charlotte? I don't believe I've had the pleasure. Please, call me "chubby." Everyone else does. I'd slug someone who called me "chubby." But I never was, so it's just amusing. [ Laughing ] I do hope that you and lyssa had a very productive morning. We took the boys to the park, and then lyssa took me brunch shopping, which always makes me happy. I know exactly what you mean. Sometimes I enjoy driving into Georgetown, parking in front of Dean & DeLuca, and cruising the cheese department. How can anyone be depressed when there are so many wonderful cheeses in the world? So, senator, how do you feel about lyssa's nomination? Oh! Do you know how damn good it feels to be asked about lyssa's nomination instead of about tax reform? I just hope you realize what a stroke of luck it was for this administration to get her. [ Doorbell rings ] Oh, lyssa, I'll get the door. Lyssa: Thanks, morrow. That boy was the best damn columnist the postever had. Really? "The prisoner of gender"! Walter: Quincy! I hope I'm not late. Lyssa: Welcome. I was doing a call-in breakfast show in Maryland. Quincy. Hi, timber. I enjoy the media. I always have a good time. Senator... Perhaps you'rethe one that should be running for office. Oh, thanks, but I have two more books to write. And I want to start my family before I focus on my public life. My next book is about women restoring their sexual identity. It's called "Venus raging." Sex for, say, lyssa's generation, became just something else to be good at, like weight lifting. But mygeneration, on the other hand, wants to come home to a warm penis. Whoa! Walter, this woman is a visionary. [ Laughter ] Is anybody hungry? Mm-hmm!yeah! Uh, I think I'll check on carmelita. Oh, carmelita, perfect! Uh, timber, carmelita's the housekeeper and her social security is fully paid. Dr. Hughes, is carmelita the one that's home when the kids get in from school? Would yoube the one home when yourkids come home from school, timber? I'd be in Baghdad, but if I were married, my wife would be home. You think so? My wife wouldn't. Oh, Walter thinks I'm entirely overcommitted. But committed to doing everything well. For instance, it used to be that whenever she got a call for jury duty, she was inevitably already scheduled to do some kind of lecture at a world conference on gonorrhea. Oh, who's hosting? And although a simple phone call to postpone would have done it, she would drag herself down to the court with her plane ticket, a copy of her lectures -- Walter, you're exaggerating. I only did it that once. I never even knew doctors had to serve on a jury. Once, a few years ago, final notice arrived on a day when both kids had chickenpox. The nanny had disappeared. Lyssa: And the crisis at the hospital. Yeah, crisis at the hospital. I advised her not to open it. Most professional women with her commitments wouldn't. Well, I didn't deliberately not open it -- I just, I misplacedit. You know what I love about the American justice system? She never heard from them again. See, my daughter has always been a hard worker. And, believe me, I know what hard work is because I was raised on a farm in Indiana. Uh-oh. Miss quince, I would like to hear more about your book "Venus raging," because it sounds like a good country-and-western song. No, no, no, dad -- ♪ well, she's a-mashin' her potatoes ♪ ♪ but Venus is a-ragin' yeehaw! Yeehaw! Lyssa, don't you wish I had the cameras rolling now? Oh, my god! Can you imagine the humiliation this poor child has suffered having me as her father? [ Laughing ] Hey, lyssa, how about that brunch? I like to call it the petit déjeuner. Yes, thank you, chubby. Everybody, to brunch! Walter, why don't you send some nice music out to the patio, and bring another pitcher of bloodies. Fizzy water -- we want fizzy water. Come, young morrow. I want you to tell timber how gay culture is redefining the midwest. Ah, have you been to Cincinnati recently, sir? One out of 10 Republicans there is gay. That explains why the Cincinnati airport is in Kentucky -- it's transport homophobia. Okay, Quincy, how do you like your bloodies -- Mary, virgin, typhoid? I don't think your wife likes me. [ Chuckles ] I thought allwomen liked you, Quincy. I'm too happy for allwomen to like me. You think my wife's unhappy? I can't find her soul. Well, you only just met her. According to time, my wife is one of our top 50 leaders over 40. Why wouldn't she be happy? I said I couldn't find her soul. You mean she's not sexy? Walter, I don't want to get into this with you. Or do you think my wife is one of the '70s good girls who came into prominence in the '90s, and schedules a half an hour a day for spontaneity? Do you want to kiss me, Walter, 'cause I think you've wanted to kiss me again all these years. Is that what this is about? Is it? Walter... Walter, you spend too much time in your head. You've been looking at me since I walked in. See something you like? Just kiss me. If you wanna get together again, it's no big deal. Quincy, you haven't told me how you like your bloodies -- Mary, virgin, typhoid? [ Chuckles ] Have I shocked you? No, but you're wrong about my wife. She's a very happy woman. Are youhappy, Walter? Me? Quincy, I live in one of the finest houses in DC. My wife is ulysses s. Grant's fifth-generation granddaughter. My children are both in the sidwell friends school and floating through cyberspace. Am I happy, Quincy quince? [ Sighs ] I would like a bloody Mary. Okay with you? Fine. Fine. Walter, I'm scared of going out there. I can tell morrow thinks I'm like virtual stupidity. [ Laughs ] Don't worry about it -- morrow thinks I'm actualstupidity. That's his job. I love it when you laugh. [ Laughs ] You're such a kind man, Walter. Quincy, do you like the beach boys? I find them unbelievably moving. Oh, all that "California girls" crap is so negative in body imagery for women. No beach boys. [ Laughs ] [ Country music plays] ♪ I been thinkin' back on the fun we had♪ ♪ the times I spent with you♪ Whoo! Yeah! ♪ ...that still remains an Ember with the glow♪ ♪ luck doesn't really seem to matter♪ ♪ and faith can let you down...♪ Walter, could you -- ♪ ...if our past could still be found♪ ♪ and I can't think of something better♪ Just bring chubby a fizzy water, please. I'll get it. ♪ Whoa-oh-oh♪ ♪ a brand-new start...♪ Lyssa, it just happened. It didn't mean anything. No, Walter. This is new. It's never happened in our home before. [ Sighs ] ♪ ...but love can start a kind of friendship♪ ♪ a glowing kind of flame♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] A great brunch, darling. Thank carmelita. No, don't give carmelita all the credit. Why not? You were certainly occupied elsewhere. Coffee?no, thanks. These madeleines are scrumptious. They're just vanilla lite wafers from a box. Our boys like them. All "lite" references are really euphemisms for "gay." Therefore, the expression "he's a little 'lite' in the loafers." I've never heard that. Oh, then, you also wouldn't know that "lite" potato chips and "lite" cream cheese are officially approved gay products. [ Laughter ] Timber, could we do this another time? I think my family's getting a little tired. I'm only going to use a minute of this. Lyssa, you've got nothing to worry about. You're the epitome of good taste. Well, actually, I ama person who always feels compelled to try to make an effort. I've always envied grace under pressure. Walter: Hear, hear. Your mother was the epitome of grace -- wonderful hostess. Timber: Really? Yeah, she was the kind of Indiana housewife who took great pride in her icebox cakes and pimento-cheese canapés. She was a terrific woman. Unfortunately, lyssa lost her when she was only 14. As I get older, I regret not knowing her better. Well, if I had to vote for the person I thought had genuine confidence and class, it would be lyssa. Okay, morrow, you can stay for dinner. No, I'm serious. With your nomination, another political dynasty like the Kennedys, the roosevelts, or the bushes is being established. Americans always enshrine their elite. Oh, I have to disagree. But that'swho's in charge, Walter. Hell-o! It's not a common story that the Asian, gay president turns to his African-American, disabled lesbian vice president and says, "we have to be sure "to have at least one straight, white guy in the cabinet. Let's give him transportation." Am I right, senator? Morrow, you lost me at the gay cream cheese. Oh, but you've argued exactly this point in congress. Liberals are complete hypocrites. They believe they deserve special treatment and forgiveness because their heart is in the right place. Now, morrow, I never mix politics with brunch. Well, take, for example, your own daughter -- wife of one of my best friends, surgeon-general nominee, a woman of impeccable commitment, at the forefront of women's-health issues, pro-choice, pro-gay, has never served on a jury. She's a very busy woman. I've always had work or family conflicts when the invitations arr-- I mean, the, um, the summonsarrived. Now, morrow, a person has two choices -- you can either shoot the cattle or run for congress -- it's an old family homily. Morrow: Wait, wait. Are you saying the people who doanswer their...Invitations, who doserve on juries, are less crucial to their families and work than your daughter? I've always presented my conflicts to the court. Except for that time when you didn't. I once didn't pay a parking ticket, and nothing ever happened. My daughter has been a brilliant and diligent public-health administrator. And she will be a brilliant and diligent surgeon general. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, timber. This has been terrific fun. I'm sorry, but chubby and I are expected at another brunch. Right. Thank you, senator. I appreciate your time. Dr. Hughes, I'm sorry. I have to ask a question just for clarification. Sure. Did you intentionally not answer a jury-duty notification? No, I believe I misplaced it. Subsequently, did you contact the county clerk's office? No. Uh, lighten up, timber. Were you intending to bring this up at the confirmation hearing? It never occurred to me. Timber, my wife is the mother of two small children. She ran a major public hospital. She is, in fact, a very busy woman. Lyssa, will you please walk with US to the car? Sure. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. That's it. We're good. Lovely brunch. I'll call you later. Okay. [ Sighs ] Quincy: There's another way to look at this -- Dr. Hughes is a prisoner of her gender. She took on so many obligations that the basic necessities of life, like responding to a simple jury form, became overwhelming. The best intentions in females often become the seeds of their own destruction. Why the hell did you do that?! I didn't do anything. Timber'sthe one who made a meal out of this. You'rethe one that brought up that jury-duty crap. You should have protected lyssa and not mentioned it. You brought it up, Walter. If I hadn't caught it, imagine where miss "warm penis" would have run with it. Don't waste your time being upset about this, lyssa. The more timber's show is talked about, the greater the buzz for you. Why can't you see it all as a game? Because it isn't,morrow. It just gives it all an edge. It's possible you could even have fun. Goodbye, morrow. Bye. Lyssa, don't worry about it. Nobody's interested. There are survivalist Nazis trying to overthrow the government in Idaho. Theyhaven't been nominated for surgeon general. Look, I can spin you out of this. I can call my old classmate Ted Kramer at the times. You know, Walter, I am really tired. Why don't you go take Quincy home? I don't want to take Quincy home. She can take a cab. I want to be here with you. I would feel better if you took her home. So then you could not talk to me for a week? Oh, go ahead, Walter, put your top down. You know, that's what girls of her generation enjoy, as opposed to the frigid, overextended, no-fun narcissists of my generation. Isn't that why you kissed her? I told you it didn't mean anything. I see. She just fell on you, Walter. Quincy! Hey. If you need more help with this, let me know. Walter said he'd drive you home. Oh, I'm at the four seasons. I can take a cab. No, no, no. Georgetown isn't as safe as it used to be. [ Clears throat ] You know, Walter has always been so proud of your achievements. Where we've erred, you will surely transcend. Thanks. Bye. Bye, timber. You're more tart than I expected. Oh, really? You and Quincy think alike. She said the same thing. Bye. So, timber, tell me -- [ clears throat ] How bad is this? Well, you can't really call it. But if it makes you feel better, watch the news tonight. You have a lot of stiff competition. A jury-duty notice isn't sexy, violent, or even bizarrely interesting. It should die overnight. So, could you not use it? It's my job. Sometimes I wish it wasn't. But just in case, have a few good answers ready. And if you do have any questions, call me. I'd like to try and guide you through this. Like a boy scout? Like a friend. It depends on how you play it. I say don't shoot the cattle yet. Keep running for congress. Thank you, Dr. Hughes. Thank you. Judy... How many times have I told you, if you leave your door open, it's an open invitation for any wet crazy on the street? Is it raining outside? Not that I know of. Then why are you wet? Why are you dry? [ Sighs ] Judy, there's a bathrobe upstairs in my closet. Lyssa, do you know what "holy tashlikh"is? No, I'm afraid I don't. Tashlikh is the festival of regrets. Good Jews throw breadcrumbs into the water and send 365 day's worth of their sins and sadness off to sea. Judy, please. My postbrunch show just blew up in my face, so [sighs] Will you just go upstairs and change? Thanks. [ Sighing ] Oh, here you go. Better? Yeah, better. Okay. I tried to drown myself, lyssa. What?! I-I went to the festival of regrets. I prayed by the banks of the potomac. I watched while the men tossed in their breadcrumbs and secret sorrow -- "oh, lord my god, I cheated on my income tax." "Oh, lord, king of the universe, "I lust for the Asian checkout girl at Hany farms delicatessen." At first, I-I remained quiet. I stood there, feeling my familiar distance and disdain, and then... Almost involuntarily, I began shredding my low-fat cranberry-orange muffin. I-I wanted this god to know me -- this yahweh to know me. So I... I tossed my first crumb into the water. "Oh, lord my god, I distrust most people I know. "I feel no comfort in their happiness, no sympathy for their sorrow." And... A tiny cranberry sits still upon the water. "Oh, lord our god, who is like you in earth or in heaven? [ Crying ] "I regret the men I've been with. "I regret never having children. I regret never having learned to be a woman." [ Sobbing ] I pull off the entire top, and the wad of muffin sails like a frigate toward the Washington monument. "Oh, lord our god, mighty of mighty, "holy of holy, I can't make life and I can't stop death. "Oh, lord my god, the lord is one, I've wasted my life." [ Voice breaking ] And then I jump in. Ha. And then? Well [sniffles] It seems like I'm still a pretty good swimmer. [ Laughing ] Oh, god. Yes, I remember -- oh [sniffles] freshman phys ed. The potomac isn't very cold in September. [ Sniffles ] So, you were fine? Oh, great, just great. I was bobbing up and down in my Liz claiborne and pearls when I noticed a box of dunkin' donut holes. It was floating by. [ Chuckles ] And suddenly I remember I must rescue the donut holes and bring them here to you, on "n" street. Lyssa... These are the donut holes of my discontent. Oh, gosh, well... Thank you. Of course, no taxi would stop for a drenched black woman who just crawled out of the potomac, so I had to walk all the way. Well... I'm glad you're feeling better. Where are you going? Um, i'm, uh... I need to call my kids. They'll be fine. Lyssa, please. I ju-- I'm -- I feel so cold... And so sad. What gives you the audacity to believe that you have failed if you can't make life or stop death? Because I was taught, if I was a good girl and I worked very hard, I could. Yeah, well, maybe they should never have taught US that. [ Sniffles ] Hi, I'm Greta Hewitt, and today on "the focus," can we do it all? Absolutely not. Greta, what about that doctor who threw away her jury-duty notice just 'cause she couldn't cope? But an impressive woman. Oh, please! We all have nanny problems. We all have a heavy workload. I don't feel sorry for her at all. Let's go, guys. Wait, mom, they're talking about you. Yeah, they don't feel sorry for you. Why should they feel sorry for me, sweetie? Come on, we all have to die, pay taxes, serve on a jury, and watch our cholesterol. That's what it is to be anAmerican. Hewitt: How is your cholesterol right now? Mom, is throwing out a jury notice a crime? I didn't throw it away -- I misplacedit. What if I did that with my homework? I'd ask you for a very serious explanation, but I wouldn't say you were no longer fit to go to school. We all have our foibles. What's that? Strengths and weaknesses. Okay, so we all have our gerbils. We all have those, too. Boy: We're getting gerbils?! No, we're not getting gerbils. We've seen the same thing over and over again with all baby boomers. The lyssa dent Hughes problem is really just the problem of her generation. Charlie, it makes about as much sense to talk about the lyssa dent Hughes generation as to talk about the Judy garland generation. [ Channel changes] Mrs. Blumberg and I would like to apologize to all of the hostages at the regal seafood restaurant. Leonard was on an antidepressant, and they changed his prescription. But now I'm on Zoloft and I'm back at Harvard. Oh, Leonard. [ Channel changes] It's up to lyssa to come out swinging. Ms. Quince, isn't it the responsibility of thepresident to come out swinging for her? Absolutely not. She may only have been waiting for the president to do the right thing. This country insists on dealing with women as casualties -- [ TV turns off] Quincy just made a very good case for you on "cross talk." Yes, my nomination is going to sell Quincy a hell of a lot of books. I'll be taking "prisoner of gender" all across the country. Oh, come on, everyone says the piece in the post this morning was very sympathetic. Shut up, Walter. No, here it is, right here -- you're "being repositioned by the media as a victim feminist." Damn it, would you just notquote Quincy to me, please? In other news, debate continues over the surgeon-general nominee. Did she disparage the mothers of america? Yeah, she was the kind of Indiana housewife who took great pride in her icebox cakes and pimento-cheese canapés. Public opinion is running against Dr. Hughes 3-to-1. I've always had work or family conflicts when the invitations arr-- I mean, the, um, thesummons arrived. Next time I get a parking ticket, I'll call it an invitation, too. You had it too easy, that's all. Everyone who grew up in the '60s had it too easy. Boys: "Lyssa Hughes knocks mothers of Indiana"? "Barry of the Barry state has word "that lyssa Hughes has more problems "than just the justice system. "First of all, she's pro-choice. Can you believe it? "And then there's her 'hackademic' husband "taking a verypersonal interest "in his gifted female students, "and Dr. Hughes doesn't seem to mind. So, do we want a fema-cuckoo being physician to the nation?" Mom, did dad ever have any other girlfriends? Of course -- before he married me. I had other boyfriends, too. Well, Barry of the Barry state says dad has no family values. He says dad has Woodstock disease. Well, Barry just wants to get talked about. Now, listen, all that matters is that your dad and I love you somuch, okay? Okay. Hey, sweetie... Oh, honey. No, I believe imisplaced it. I believe imisplaced it. Misplaced it. Man: Dr. Hughes has been somewhat silent... Woman: I'm standing outside the home of Dr. Lyssa Hughes... Lyssa: Icebox cakes... At a white-house press conference this morning, the press secretary reiterated... This is Janie dugan. ...the president strongly backs his choice for surgeon general. Another television truck just pulled up. It's all about the damn pimentos. You listening? What? Usa todaysays that the housewives of Indiana are picketing radio stations. The icebox-cake and pimento-canapé moms apparently are furious at you for minimizing their lives. Oh, my god. This is ridiculous. Yeah. I'll just go out there and tell those people the truth. You can't do that. What are you talking about? Of courseI can do that. I'll just go tell them all that here's a person who can do some good, who has donea lot of good, a-and that a damn misplaced slip of paper is being used to unravel all of her possibilities. I-It's unacceptable! It's not just a person-- it's you,lyssa. I know that, okay? No, you don't. I know it! No, you don't! This has nothing to do with a damn slip of paper! It's the women of america who are angry at you. You're pretty, you got two great kids, you're successful, you're thin, and you have a great soul. Let's face it, darling, in the heartland, that means you are one privileged, ungrateful-to-her-mother, conniving bitch. [ Telephone ringing ] I'm not gettin' it. Could be the president. Hello? Uh...no. No, Martha, I didn't know that. No, but thank you so much for calling. Seems I've made the front page of the New York post. Picture of me at safeway yesterday -- headline -- "Dr. Icebox shops." [ Chuckles ] Okay, everybody, today we're going to make icebox cakes with our special guest, Quincy quince. Quincy: This is great... [ Laughing ] Guys, let's go. Come on. Shoes and your backpacks. Come on, now! Mom, I really don't feel well. Are you sick? I don't know. I just don't feel well. Oh, baby, what's up? When the invitations arr-- I mean, the, um, thesummons. Quincy: With lyssa Hughes, we have one of the most respected public-health officials in this century being turned into a victim. Timber: Did you intentionally not answer a jury-duty notification? Morrow: The lyssa Hughes problem only came up because it was a really dull news week. If we bomb Kosovo again, no one will notice... Senator: My daughter has been a brilliant and diligent... Lyssa: I went to Bryn mawr with his wife. Quincy: This generation never examined the consequences... Woman: ...You're right. If she can't handle this... Quincy: ...Women as casualties of gender. It's time for lyssa Hughes to take back her power... ...inevitably leads US to the current "jurygate." Current jurygate... Jurygate... Jurygate... This will be a much more formal interview. I understand. Woman: Mr. Tucker?Thank you. And a much higher-profile. Of course. I've become a hot commodity, right? Just ask miss quince. Boy, she's certainly had a lot of play out of this. Oh, yeah. Are you attracted to her? What, are you kidding? No. Way too old. I'm into 20-year-old bimbos. You with me? Well, yeah. I mean, those girls on the cover of sports illustrated with the swimsuits? The swimsuit girls are much too upscale for me. I'm talking dunkin' donut twins in Eugene, the cashier of the shreveport airport. That'samerica to me. Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom. Then she gets you a beer and turns into a sandwich. [ Chuckles ] What kind of sandwich? Are you really choosing to continue this conversation with me? Timber, I haven't heard from the president in over a week, okay? I may have set back every single cause I've ever believed in in my life, not to mention cast a dark shadow on women in politics, and probably put the final lid on national health insurance, so, yeah, yeah, I really, reallywant to know -- what kind of damn sandwich? Brie with Pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. [ Chuckles ] Wow! That is a very pretentious sandwich. She couldn't have turned into a grilled cheese or something? Okay! All right! Then, so, see you Sunday. Oh, man. Good evening, I'm Lacy Anne Cochran reporting from the home of Dr. Lyssa Hughes. Do you have any comment regarding the controversy over your nomination for the surgeon general? Dr. Hughes, is there anything that you'd like to say on your behalf?! Man: Isn't it your obligation to perform? Is this the woman who hates icebox cakes and her mother? Don't forget children and trees. Hi, dad. Hello, Charlotte. Hello, darling. Oh, lyssa, you look tired. Call my Eva at Elizabeth arden's. She'll take care of you. You heard from the president yet? Nope. Lyssa, I'd like you to meet Billy Robbins from my office. Hello, Billy. He is the best spin-control man in the senate, and he's only 12 years old. Uh, professor Hughes, your father tells me Tim Tucker's doing a follow-up interview Sunday. Word is, Barbara and Diane can't believe he nabbed you. Lyssa's best friend would also like to speak with timber. Who's that? Dr. Judith b. Kaufman. She and lyssa have been friends since miss Porter's. Um, I wouldn't play up the miss Porter's bit. It's a little too elitist. Judith was the first African- American on full scholarship. Affirmative action is also dicey. All right, she was the first Jew on full scholarship. [ Sighs ] Dr. Hughes, I only want to present you in the best possible light. You may be a privileged person, but you're also a working mom, you love your husband, you love your kids, you have strong family values, and on Sunday, you go to church and enjoy hiking. Do I also coach the gymnastics team? I wish you did. She's being sarcastic. No sarcasm admitted.Sorry. Nothing east-coast, Ivy-league, no smarty-pants. "Smarty-pants." No women's lib. No highfalutin charm. Remember, you're from Indiana. You know, I haven't lived in Indiana for 30 years, Billy. [ Laughing ] Well, um, sometimes it's just a matter of finding out what the people want, giving it to them, and getting on with it. I suggest you wear feminine attire tomorrow -- professional but soft, nothing black or brown. I-I can't pretend to be somebody I'm not. Lyssa... You've gotten yourself into a bit of trouble. I'm just trying to help you out of it. Okay. I'd focus on Grant the general, not Grant the president. [ Sighs ] Okay. In the latest u.S. Ranking of American presidents, Grant came in 41st, just above last-place Warren Harding. Wow. Morrow McCarthy mentioned that on "Charlie Rose" last night. Charlie got a 3 share, which is very impressive for Charlie. I know, I'm very happy I could help him out. Morrow's a real crossover talent. We're lucky he's been so publicly very supportive -- eh -- eh -- eh -- would you excuse me, please? Yeah. Excuse me. Do you think that man ever has sex? Excuse me? Do you think that immaculate little man ever takes off those preppy little clothes and gets down and dirty and nasty-sweaty? Ew. Scary, perma-pressed creature. Do you mind if I smoke? Oh, god, of course you do. Your father has been getting at least 2,000 calls a day. He's torn. He's a very good father. But he's also a very good senator, and he'll be up for re-election next year. I know, but what can I do? [ Sighs ] Let me give you some advice, lyssa. Yeah. Protect your family. Protect your marriage. And if you don't, I certainly will protect mine. There are plenty of not-so-nice people out there, lyssa. They'll tear you apart because they're jealous or disappointed or, even worse, because they've got nothing better to do, and then, when it's all over, when all the hurt and damage is done, you come back to yourself. So you can ruin yourself by being Valiant and impressive, or you can find the most idiotic means to gracefully move forward. Frankly, that's why, until I married your father, I took two anacin every morning for 30 years. I never expected to be this happy, especially in the derrière of my life. [ Chuckles ] Charlotte said this is all putting a terrible strain on dad. This is not about your father. Oh, Walter, I'm a rational woman. I know what this is and isn't about. [ Sighs ] You're making this much harder than it has to be. I never meant for our life to become about me. [ Sighs ] National opinion is running 4 to 1 against your colleague, Dr. Lyssa dent Hughes. Well, timber... I believe, by denying lyssa Hughes this post, we will be denying the country the talents of a remarkably concerned and inventive public servant, but also denying the girls of america someone they could, with pride, imagine themselves growing up to be. What about failing to respond to the now-infamous jury notice? Is this something that, on an action, you would encourage in other young women? Who does your taxes, Mr. Tucker, your mail, your housecleaning? Dr. Kaufman, who's the interviewer here? [ Chuckles ] Stay with me on this, timber. Has any of your staff ever misplaced a piece of paper? Then why this outburst? Is it a feminist backlash, or has she become, as Quincy quince has said, a disempowered victim? I think we have more serious issues here than some trumped-up clichés created by a would-be best-selling author. Last question -- what advice would you have for your friend, Dr. Hughes, right now? "As you ramble on through life, brother, "whatever be your goal, "keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not upon the hole." Advice that's good for all of US. Thank you, Dr. Judith b. Kaufman. Man: Timber, we may have a problem with the sound on that. That's all right. We'll be fine. You sure? Yes. Okay, everyone. I'll get that. Are they shooting "Hollywood squares" here today? I'll take center square. Oh, morrow. Are you here by invitation? I was next door espousing wisdom on "week in review." It's Sunday, the day of rest and punditry. Timber, are youhere by invitation? I'm interviewing lyssa this afternoon. Thank you very much, doctor. Very helpful. Yes, you obviously came very well prepared. You look...Terrific. Why the hell did you do this to Walter and lyssa? I was just making a point. Like writing a column, I forgot they were people I know and like. That must be hard to live with. What do you want me to say, Judith? I didn't know this would happen. I don't feel sorry for you. Why can't you understand it was just a hypothetical argument? I'm a doctor, morrow. I can't afford to be hypothetical. What I say has real consequences. Well, what I say usually doesn't. I just had a good answer, and I was always taught... To give the best answer. Well, congratulations. You got another "a." [ Sighs ] Judith, would you have dinner with me? [ Chuckles ] Morrow, if you have a serious mother hang-up, I can refer you to a few numbers. I'm just looking for dinner -- a dialogue between christians and Jews. Well, I'm afraid my schedule is completely booked just now. I have the career of a 55-year-old man, the infertile reproductive cycle of a 46-year-old woman, which collapsed today for what I have decided is the final time, and the emotional stability of a 15-year-old girl. I don't need any more stimulation! I'm sorry that happened today. I -- you deserve great happiness. Is that hypothetical, too? Judith... If I don't have Walter and lyssa's house to come to, I have nowhere else to go. You should have thought of that earlier, before you gave such a good answer. [ Sighs ] I heard you got "Charlie Rose" a 3 share on Friday night. This all could have been avoided. You didn't have to run that piece. Lyssa is an earnest public servant, and she'd make a fine surgeon general. Ithink so, but youcould have fooled me. I may be just a non-Ivy-league, TV-news guy, but the things you said about Dr. Hughes last week didn't sound like an overwhelming endorsement to me. [ Sighs ] Walter: Uh, we're here for Dr. Hughes. Try the control room. Hey, Nick, kip. Hello, Walter. You a sadist or just a little creep? I came to say, "I'm sorry." Get out of here before my wife comes down here. Good luck with the interview. Dad, why are you so mean to him? Isn't he your friend? Walter: I don't know. Quincy: I think I'm gonna watch this from down in the studio. Hey, guys! What are you doing here? Didn't you know? I'll be commenting with timber right after the taping. The buzz is that the president will have to personally go to the wall to save lyssa, or he'll be forced to pull her down. This is a very big deal. Well, apparently, now so are you. Well, actually, I was wondering if you could arrange for me to spend some time alone with lyssa before the taping. Quincy, my wife won't talk to you. Why not? Are you serious? Walter, I don't think you appreciate what I've been doing for lyssa. Whether she gets this job or not, she's still gotten a lot of heat out of this, and there will be lectures, books, she can do science commentary. This is a win-win situation for her. I will not help you. Hey, Walter... I hope this isn't about the other day. You have your commitments. I have mine. Come on, let's go find your mom. Dad? Dad, is the president gonna pull mom down? No, no, no, no. It's not gonna happen. Woman: What about her eyebrows? I still think there could be more arch. Guys, I've been practicing medicine for 20 years without arching eyebrows. You need the lift. Lift 'em. But what about the headband? It's a little on-the-money. No, no, no, I want the headband, okay? All right. ♪ da-da da-dun dun-da-a-a hey, hi. Where are the boys? Oh, they're in the studio, checking out the equipment. You look just great! I owe it all to my team. Thank you. I see you and Walter have come to some conclusions. Yep. Miss quince, I'm Billy Robbins. We really appreciate all your support. Mr. Robbins, could I have some time alone with lyssa? What'd I tell you? No, Walter, I'd liketo talk to Quincy. You don't have to. It's okay. Quincy, care for a cup of coffee? They're set up for a wedding next door in the greenroom. How areyou holding up? You seem to be the expert on me. How do youthink I'm holding up? Want a carrot curl or a radish Rose? Maybe this is none of my business... Oh, but I amyour business. Sorry. ...but I amon your side. I can think of a lot of reasons why you wouldn't like me, but it's not good for any of US to watch an established icon being hung out to dry. The last time I wore a headband was at a miss Porter's school dance in 1967. I had a crush on Tommy talbott from hotchkiss, but he liked girls who played lacrosse and wore ladybug dresses and headbands, so the night that Tommy showed up at miss Porter's dance, I put one on. How'd he like it? Mmm! He lovedit! We went out for two years after that. But whenever I came back from a date with him, I would pull that headband right off my head, because mybest friends weren't the lacrosse girls that Tommy talbott preferred. No, my friends lit incense and stayed up all night reading rilke. What was odd about me was that the headband girls thought I was one of them, and the girls who wouldn't be caught dead wearing one would swear I was one of them, too. I'm a senator's daughter, Quincy. I can put it on, and I can take it off. [ Sighs ] I haven't had to do it for a while. I guess I thought [chuckles] I had earned the right not to. But I won't be hung out to dry. No, no, no, no, no. Not even if I have to wear a headband, bake cookies, or climb a stairmaster to pluto to do it. Hello, timber. You're looking tidy, Dr. Hughes. I'm feelingtidy. This will be straightforward. I will ask you a mix of questions about how you're dealing with the pressure, a little bit about your family, a little bit more about your politics. Do we have to talk about my family? Yes, but you can divert me. But here's a tip -- if you get emotional, go for it. This isn't gonna be a day at the beach, and I may come on pretty strong, but you can handle it. I've been doing double doses of estrogen in preparation. Don't worry, I'll be good. Hi, mom.Hey, mom. Mom, we just saw Veronica from "the focus." Ugh, those women are vultures. Quincy, is that any way to talk about your colleagues? Can we get started on this, please? Lyssa, don't be nervous. Remember, follow my lead. We know how accomplishedyou are. Now we need to know how humanyou are. "Human." I'll remember that. Human, human, human. Jonathan will get you miked. Okay, let's go. Bye, Quincy! [ Blows in bottle twice ] Mom, there's Veronica! Boy: Hi, Veronica! Hi. Oh, Dr. Hughes. Hello. Hello. You are so much prettier in person. Thank you. My sons and I are big fans of your show. You certainly have given US a lot of grist. Good luck, and whichever way it turns out, we would loveto have you on "the focus." Absolutely. Really? Great! Great! Okay. Bye, Veronica.Bye, sweetie. Mom, you hate her. Lyssa: Shh, shh, shh, be quiet. Hi, chubby.Oh, hi! Okay, you guys are gonna wait right here. We'll be fine. What did he mean "to show how human you are"? I guess he meant to show that I'm just like other people. But you're not. I think you're a great American, mom. [ Chuckles ] Hey, come on. Blink twice for me. Man: We're ready. Okay. You'll be fine. [ Indistinct conversations ] You all right?Yep. [ Indistinct conversations ] Man: Okay, we have speed. [ Theme music plays] Three's hot. Everybody ready? Have a good show. 5... 4, 3, 2, 1. Man #2: And here, for "time zone ii" -- timber Tucker. Tonight, a "time zone ii" exclusive -- "an American daughter: A family under siege." We'll be speaking with Dr. Lyssa dent Hughes, her husband, Dr. Walter abrahmson, who is a professor of sociology at Georgetown university, and her father, senator Alan Hughes of Indiana. Walter, how has this last week changed your life? We've done a lot of talking, a lot of holding hands, and just being there the way old, married couples do. I'm not ordinarily a religious man, but I have to admit that, in the past week, I've joined my wife in praying. Senator Hughes, how has this past week been for you? There's mounting pressure from the senate and from women's groups from the left and the right for the president to remove your daughter's name from nomination. Timber, I've been a senator for 24 years, a congressman for 8 years before that, but first of all, I am a father. Now, lyssa and I, we don't see eye to eye on most subjects, except for coleslaw. We both like it dry. But there is no one that I believe in more. But technically, your daughter did commit a crime. My daughter committed an oversight. I made a mistake. I should have answered that notice, and I apologize for it. It was simply bad juggling of a working mother. Have you heard from the president this week, Dr. Hughes? No, but this has been a very busy week for him. The battle to balance the budget is ongoing. Senator: I believe the president knows he made the perfect choice when he nominated my daughter. So, here you are, a descendant of a president, a pioneer in healthcare reform, truly an American daughter of the highest caliber in the midst of an ever-growing political and feminist maelstrom. Now, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? I don't look at things in black-and-white. It's not even, really, good medicine. If there's anyfault, though, it's mine. As I said, I made a mistake. I was wrong, and I take full responsibility. Well, you've obviously had a long and distinguished career in women's healthcare, but female opinion is running against you 4 to 1. Do you have any idea why? I don't know. I was honestly surprised by that. Most of my work in medicine has been in increasing awareness of female-health issues, so -- when you refer to female-health issues, are you referring to your position on choice? Reproductive rights are one of many issues. For instance, primary-care doctors -- yeah, but you are pro-choice. Yes. And your father is not. My father and I have differing opinions on many subjects... Except coleslaw. Do you feel as though you're close to your father and his wife? Yes, I'm very happy dad met chubby -- I mean [chuckles] Charlotte. Have you been close to all of his wives? Well, I was away at college when he married Faye Francine, and I was a resident when he married, um, ginger, um... Eichenbacher, sorry. So you weren't close to them. I believe that they were both very nice women, but I was already focusing on my own professional life, so that took a lot of dedication, and -- well, you have been, for the last 10 years, on the good housekeepinglist of American-women role models. Is that what makes women dislike you? Do they think you're too perfect? [ Sighs ] I hope not. Well, you are privileged. My greatest privilege is my family. Well, let's talk a little bit more about your family. Your mother. My mother died when I was 14. When we last talked, you referred to your mother as an ordinary Indiana housewife who made the now-infamous icebox cakes. Yeah. Can you tell US more about her? She was an attractive woman. She went to church. Did you resent her? No. Did you feel her horizons were limited? How is this relevant to my confirmation? Because there are women in america who feel that your attitude toward your mother is your attitude toward them. I promise you, it's not. Were you always closer to your father than your mother? My father and I both chose careers in public life. Do you think perhaps your father's career in public life caused your mother to suffer, like other political wives? As you know, many famous political wives -- timber, I really don't believe we can judge who will make the best surgeon general based on their mother's marital happiness. But you do agree that a family life is important. Yes, of course it's important, but it's also private. Well, the surgeon general is considered the physician to the nation, and many American women feel that your private life disqualifies you from such an important humanitarian position. How could they possibly know about my private life? They are convinced, according to our latest "time zone" poll, that you are both condescending and elitist. The women of america should concern themselves with the possibility of their reproductive rights being taken away from them. The women of america should concern themselves with the fact that breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer are grossly underfunded compared to prostate cancer. The women of america should concern themselves with the fact that their children are increasingly smoking, falling prey to drug addiction, and the rapid growth of teenage violence. The women of america should notconcern themselves with my father's wives, my cooking, or my mother. So you're emotional about this subject. Yeah! Yeah! I'm emotional! I share that with the women of america! [ Chuckles ] Would you like to know, timber [sighs] Why I have avoided public life until this nomination? Mm-hmm. Because I know that I can make a difference in the world without having to go through any of this. I know if I raise money for new wallpaper in my chemotherapy unit, it'll make a difference. People I work with, they look at life and death every day. Sometimes we manage to save life, and sometimes we don't, but I promise you, it has nothing to do with whether we did or did not like our mothers. It has to do with service. Dr. Hughes, are you saying you're not really interested in public life? I'm saying that I don't know what public life has become. Or perhaps you mean that you're too good for it. [ Chuckles ] Oh, there's nothing quite so satisfying as erasing the professional competency of a woman, is there? Hmm! Especially when there's such an attractive, personal little hook we can hang on it. "Oh, we all understand it now! "She must have hated her mother! "That's why she's such a good doctor! "She must be a bad, cold person! "That's why she achieved so much! "And anyway, it would be all right "if she were a manand cold. "Oh, that man would be tough! "We wouldn't care if hehated his mother. "But a woman-- "oh, a woman from good schools and a good family "who achieved it all so easily, "no, that woman has to be made to... "Publicly suffer so that we know she's real." "She has to soften how she looks and how she talks "so we approve of her. "Oh, that kind of hard-working woman "has to learn that it is arrogant to be herself. "And if she refuses to compensate for her achievements, then she deserves to be hung out to dry." Whoa, sorry. Now, there's -- there'san argument the pundits can chew on all night! They can argue whether lyssa dent Hughes' generation made any impact at all. The truth is, we're all still just twisting in the wind. How do you think the president's gonna feel about this? Well, I really wouldn't know, since he and his wife haven't been in touch with me, but I would gladly, gladly take their call. How do you think they're gonna react to this interview? Well, I don't know. How do youthink they'll react, timber? Senator, do you think your daughter's challenge to the president is unconditional surrender? You know, i-i-i-I've completed this interview. Tonight, lyssa dent Hughes defends her nomination to the women of america. Yeah, I'll be right there. For all of US here at "time zone," thanks for joining US. Man: We're clear, everyone. That's it. Yeah, okay. I'm okay. Lyssa, that was fantastic. You got it. Is there anything you want to add before I comment outside? No, um, I think I said what I need to say. I think I might like to mention this to a few of my colleagues before they watch it on television tonight. That all right with you, lyssa? Sure. You all right, dad? I'm fine if you are. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry it turned out this way. I tried to warn you. I appreciate it. I guess you wouldn't like to do a follow-up. [ Chuckles ] No, I don't think so, timber. Have I ever told you my chaos theory of broadcasting? No. Whatever is happening at this moment won't be happening three minutes later, so in the long run, how important is it? To the person it's happening to, it's a lifetime, a memoir. And that's the ballgame. Guess I'll go get the kids. You were magnificent. You were just great. [ Sniffles ] Judith says I don't know what it is to want. [ Voice breaking ] Well, I really wanted that job, Walter. I would have been good. [ Sniffles ] We're really smart people, lyssa. [ Sighs ] We deserve to get everything out of it that the really smart ones get. I don't -- I don't even know what "really smart" means anymore. [ Sighs ] Maybe Quincy's really smart. Did you sleep with her, too? Yeah. Why did you... Wait till now to ask? I was busy -- jury duty. [ Sniffles ] I'm sorry. Me too. I'm sorry we couldn't have broken this to timber. The women of america might have become quite sympathetic. I don't even know who -- [ sighs ] What I'm supposed to want to be anymore. This was my nomination. Can we please not make it about your...Humiliation? Hey. Hey. You guys okay? Yep. You sure? We gotta get going. Come here. I'm so proud of my husband. Aww. Bye, lyssa. Bye, chubby. Goodnight, grandpa. [ Sniffles ] Bye, dad. Hey, you guys ready to go home? You told the truth. Oh, honey, I tried. But that was a really brave thing to do. It went well, don't you think? [ Chuckles ] Oh... [ Sighs ] You okay? Sure. Fine. You know, I've been trying to work through a problem here, lyssa. Do you think the man who nominated you -- a good, well-educated man who reminds US so much of ourselves -- is, in fact, more insidious than someone who hates every damn thing we believe in? [ Chuckles ] Why don't you ask your senior seminar tonight? I was planning to skip it, stay home with my wife. No, no, don't skip it, Walter. I could be the subject of the final debate instead of my father's position on choice. Better get going. Will you be here when I get back? Where would I go tonight? Oh, I don't know. I guess I'm just afraid... Like our boys. It's all right, Walter. I'll still be here when you get home. What about tomorrow? [ Scoffs ] Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, I turn into a sandwich. What? Oh, just some useless wisdom I picked up along the way. You know what I regret even more than ever mentioning the damn jury notice? I regret not telling you how much I want US to work out. [ Sighs ] I love you, lyssa. I've had endless Patience for you. Now you have to have endless Patience for me. Just so quiet. I don't know, maybe it's better. Maybe we've both been relying on the noise a little too much. [ Door closes ] Well, the reporters' vans have all pulled out. And I was hoping to do a swift business in souvenirs. Do you suppose anyone's gonna remember this six months from now? They'll remember it was bad. They just won't be quite sure why. Take care of my wife, senator. [ Sighs ] I wanted to see if you might be interested in a late-afternoon stroll. In black tie? Did you bring me a corsage, too? Actually, I thought I'd offer, you'd decline, and I'd escort chubby to a fund raiser for the lab school. I surrendered, daddy. At 2:24 today, I called the president and withdrew. I know. I heard it on the radio in the car. Hmm. Oh, mouse. Why didn't you call me before you withdrew? Would ulysses have called hisfather? I made a quick assessment. The commander in chief thanked me for moving so quickly. You know I would have stood by you, no matter what. You tried, dad. Ahh, you're off the hook. I'm the one who didn't heed the ancient wisdom of Billy Robbins. I figured out why. You read too many of those girl books about Florence nightingale and Eleanor Roosevelt when you were young. I should have found you heroines that were more sensible people, like Ariana huffington or that missing spice girl. Come on, lyssa, walk with me. No, I'm okay. The usual route. Alan: I've brought you here from the first time you could ride on my shoulders. Lyssa: I know. Lyssa, when this term is over, chubby and I have decided to visit her born-again, golf-pro son down in Sydney. What? Well, with time getting short, I've decided I would rather shoot the cattle than run for congress. Did you come to this conclusion this past week? Jesus! I can't put anything over on you, can I? [ Laughs ] You mind if we stop and rest a little? Sure, you okay? Oh, yeah. Lyssa? Yeah, dad? Make sure I'm not buried here. There's too much competition from all these egomaniac senators and generals. You just scatter my ashes on the indy 500 speedway. Oh, please. Dad, do you remember when I was in elementary school, every two years, just before your next election, you would buy me this red chesterfield coat? That was a classic coat. Yeah, it was a classic coat for a 5-year-old! I was 12! That coat was a red badge of wool. But you brought it out of storage for every campaign. Oh, yes, always. Lyssa in red, shaking hands, passing out brochures. Until you began telling the electorate that you no longer believed in your own candidate. Well, I developed a conscience, both about the content and the garment. [ Laughs ] Do you know what is so stupid? You're anything but stupid. No, I promise you... This is stupid. [ Sighs ] I was just thinking how... I would give anything... [ Voice breaking ] ...To have you show up at my house and say... "Everything's gonna be fine." [ Sobbing ] "And here's an awful, red coat." [ Laughs ] Aww. [ Sobbing ] Lyssa... You have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about... ...unless you're scared of your own dignity. You know what, dad? You really should start thinking about writing your own speeches. [ Laughs ] Well, actually, I didn't come without an assistant. [ Laughs ] I brought a letter from ulysses to his daughter, Ellen wrenshall Grant, from cold harbor, Virginia. June 4th, 1864. Wow. Shall I read it? Please. [ Chuckles ] "My dear little Nellie, "I received your pretty, well-written letter "today in my camp. "Your mother wrote "that you no longer wish to portray "the old woman that lived in a shoe at the fair. "Dear Nellie, there are times when idon't wish to go on, either." [ Sighs ] "We've been fighting now for 30 days "and have every prospect of more fighting to do "before we get into Richmond. "It seems to me, for both of US, "our task is to rise and continue. "Look after your mother, "study your lessons, "and you will be contented and happy. Love, papa." [ Chuckles ] Dad, Nellie Grant had a disastrous life! Her parents married her off to some philandering brit, and she ended up divorced and with 4 children at 35. Our family is American, and has been for generations!And has been for generations! [ Trumpet plays ] Oh... Man: Ready! Fire! [ Gunshots ] Hi, honey. I just saw on television that the women of america, 4 to 1, want the president to have a dog instead of a cat. The women of america also feel you were mistreated 5 to 1. Apparently, the women of america give you an 80% approval rating. Now, I need a second opinion. Can you please explain, what is wrong with the women of america? I think you'd better call in a specialist. I'm, um, I'm really not equipped to answer this. Lyssa... What's that for? Something terrible must have happened. I'm in a good mood today. Mmm! [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] Hi, I'm Veronica. Today on "the focus," senator Portman's diary. Ladies, is his sex life really our business? Woman: You know, Veronica, this is the kind of thing that makes me miss lyssa dent Hughes. Shewas dull, but you'd be safe having dinner with her. I think we've lost something really good with lyssa Hughes' departure from public life. She's not as funny as senator Portman. The guy's hilarious. He's a nympho. Who are they gonna get for the surgeon general? No one. They're letting it rest. Ohhh! too hot a potato! So, what will happen to lyssa Hughes? She'll probably write a book, like everybody else. A lot of women want her to run for office. They identify with her. She's popular. I don't hear that! When are we going to stop being victims? We are goddesses! We have to be strong! Do you mind? [ British accent ] No. I hate those women. They remind me of my sister. [ Chuckles ] ...america's sweetheart. [ Sighs ] So, how are you feeling? Rather be in Bermuda. Oh, me too. If I haveto be here, at least this is a nice place. I'm glad. You look familiar. Do I know you? I'm Dr. Hughes. I run this hospital. And you're talking to me. [ Chuckles ] Mrs. Kramer... Our task is to rise and continue. I beg your pardon? You're my patient, Mrs. Kramer. Oh. [ Chuckles ] All right. captions paid for by hearst entertainment and syndication That's a gimme?
