What should we play? I know, I'm a tiger and you're my guardian. Stupid cat! Hey, Quiltshoe. Could you play with me? - I can't. I have work to do. Take this to your dad and ask him. Dad, come play with me. - I'm in the middle of my research. Ask your mum. - The postman saidto ask you. He brought this letter. From school... Mum, what are you reading? - Just looking at the job ads. Oh. Could you play with me? Where's Hayflower? - I don't know. Hayflower, willyou play with me? Yes. It is clean now. Let's play I'm a panther and you're my guardian. Drink some juice and use the toilet so you don't needto pee right away. Will we always be together? - Yes. HAYFLOWER AND QUILTSHOE Look, I'm this big! I can reach the sky! Be careful. I could go to school! - Not untilyou're old enough. How much is old enough? - This much. Why school? I heard pupils eat spaghetti at school. - Time to eat! Don't bother us! This is more important! Come, mum is calling. I'll race you. OK. I want a head start! I won! Hello, little ladies! - Hello. Look what we brought for Hayflower. A school bag. - Thank you. And a small practice bag for Quiltshoe. - Neat! We were supposedto buy a bag for Hayflower tomorrow. Is tomorrow today? - Tomorrow comes after sleeping one night. I'm hungry. - You can all eat at our house. Ljust made lunch. - It's not good. The Alibullens are better cooks. Quiltshoe... - Mum is just as good a cook. Don't mind us. We're just being helpful. Helga and Halise sewed a new button on when the old one fell off. Help, the potatoes! Yuk! Potatoes again! - Ok, time to eat. Would you please join us? If we eat potatoes, I'll eat here. You can't eat there every day. - I'll come out only for spaghetti! Dad won't let me cook spaghetti. - Potatoes are much healthier. Kids grow up big eating potatoes. Dad knows. He's a scientist. Good, Hayflower. But the food at the Alibullen sisters' is even healthier! When you eat their buns and cakes you'll be this big! Those are for dessert. First you have to eat proper food. Smoked potatoes... Mum, I heardthey eat spaghetti at school! Is it true? No, they eat potatoes. - Stupid dad! Mum, don't they eat spaghetti? - Matt! I've heardthat they do. Listen, a letter came from school. - What letter? "Dear parents, we hope your child knows how to tie their shoe laces - and peel potatoes." Children must know how to peel potatoes so they eat potatoes. I know how to peel my potatoes. - And mine too. Hayflower, come and jump! - Soon! Hayflower, it'IItake all evening to clean this. Let me show you. Come and jump with me now! We can't. It's eight o'clock. It's time to wash and go to bed. No! Mum, dad, read a bedtime story! - Hayflower will read! Good night. - Good night. Hayflower? - You mustn't talk after good night. Who will peel my potatoes when you're at school? - Mum and dad. No, they won't! And who will tie my shoelaces? Mum and dad. Be quiet now. It's children's bedtime. But they've never done that. - Because they're busy. Be quiet. I don't want youto go to school. - Children have to go. But I'll be alone. Nobody will take care of me or play with me. You can't go to school. Don't be upset. The Alibullen sisters can't replace you. They even wash the girls' clothes. Like I don't know how. It's easy for them to be perfect. There're two of them and I'm alone. Tomorrow you can do allthe laundry so they have nothingto wash. Matt, there's no sense in me pretending I'm a homemaker. Maybe I should get a job? I have a degree from a university! Mum, are you getting a job? Why aren't you sleeping? - Is Quiltshoe up too? No. Why are you up then? Off to bed! - Yes. Where were you? - Downstairs. What for? - I asked if they'dtake care of you when I'm at school. What didthey say? - They told me to go back to bed. Don't tell me you obeyedthem? - Yes. Children don't always have to be nice! They can be naughty too! Good night. - I won't sleep at all! Hayflower, Quiltshoe! Morning! It's laundry day! This is a major dust collector! - Mum, it's mine. Walter's dying! - Who's dying? Elmer! - I don't want it to die! Who's dying? - Walter and Elmer! Oh, no. Walter, please don't die. - Poor Elmer. Hanna, who's Walter? - Quiltshoe's teddy bear. Why are they yelling? Their toys are goingto be clean. Why are they so small? - They've become babies. I don't want a baby bear. Walter, please grow up again, . Girls, come and eat the potatoes. - When willthey grow up again? Why didthey shrink? - The water was too hot. I usedthe white wash cycle! I'm so sorry, sweethearts. That's OK. - It's not! I don't want a baby bear. Let's stretch them. Hayflower, take its feet. Stop! I don't want a stretched bear! Hey, girls. Eat the potatoes. You'll feel better. - Yeah... No! I want spaghetti! - Not in this house! Kids can't live in this house! Mum apologised. You have to forgive her. No! Being soft doesn't help. It's time to use the big guns! So long, squares! Watch out, Quiltshoe! Where are you going? You shouldn't walk here alone. - We'll move in with the Alibullens. At least they don't have washing machines. We can't move just like that. My school starts soon. The Alibullens willteach you. Forward! Miss Alibullen, may I say you look like a painting sittingthere. What are the police doing? - Have they been robbed? When I say go I'll push and you pull. - OK. Go! Try to move yourself. Everybody help! The bottom of the carcass is stuck. Useless. It's not moving. Push properly. - I've got the heavy end! If she didn't eat for a week, she'd pop out herself. I'm so sorry about allthis trouble. - Move aside. 85 centimetres. 52 centimetres. Miss Alibullen, how did you get stuck? - We had a fire drill - andthe window was the only way out. We're lucky. Now we know you can't fit through the window. The women would be scared if I used an axe. It's the only way. Don't touch Halise! Want somethingto eat? Some ham? Hey, girls! My leg itches. Scratch it with the rake. Here? Don't be alarmed. This is the only way! - We'll enlarge the window. Would you like some coffee? What right did you have to get out? - We saved Halise. You're so resourceful! Thank you. - Family members help each other. Family? Let's divide the rooms. - Quiltshoe! I'll count. Eeny meeny miney mo, catch a pixie by its toe ifithollers, letit go! The kitchen is your study. This must be a new game. Quiltshoe! Remember, we're just visiting. Hayflower will sleep there and youtwo will sleep there. Where willyou sleep, then? - I won't sleep at all! This is the gym. Here you climb! Here you stretch. Here you do gymnastics. Here you jump. Here you lift weights. - Look out, Helga! She smiles even when she's hurt. We don't care about little things in our house! You hear that? - They're serious about moving in. Didn't youtellyour parents you're here? What didthey say? - Nothing. They don't care. Of course they do. They love you. If I had been blessed with a family I would love them too. She's tried hard but nothing's happened. We'll see. Things needtime. They do care about us. When Hayflower goes to school I'll be alone. Hayflower gets spaghetti and I have to eat potatoes. Now you can eat as much spaghetti as you want, dear child. Why do you have kids' favourite food if you don't have kids? - But we do! Youtwo. Girls! Girls! Did you search the house and bushes? - What if something bad has happened? Hayflower? Quiltshoe! - I'll callthe police. The more robust Miss Alibullen made it. It has enough cream for my taste They know how to bake. But rescuingthem took too much of our valuable time. Police. Dear girls, the police are your friends. They'IItake you home. I'm not going anywhere! You Bellybutton! Ouch! - Are you hurt, constable? Darn kid! Stop! Stop! This means war. We won't speak to them again. Did you hear me? Not one word. Stay here, I'IItellthe parents. Make sure they don't run. Girls, let's go. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, stupid police! Stupid police! Let me go! Here we are. Mummy missed you so much. - I'm sorry. You spoke! I'll read you a bedtime story. I can do it. - I will do it. I assume the law can leave? Why did you run away? School starts soon. I didn't. I got scared Quiltshoe would get hit by a car. Mum, can Quiltshoe move in with the Alibullens? Those batty ladies... She'll be alone when school starts. - But mum and dad will be here. But what if you get a job? Quiltshoe isn't speaking. - Isn't speaking? Dad, could you peel Quiltshoe's potatoes when I go to school? Why isn't she talking? - What does she want with a potato? She wants youto peel her potatoes when I go to school. You shouldn't peelthem at all. But the letter saidthat children should know how to peel. The sender didn't know that potassium, a rich trace nutrient - is just under the skin whereas magnesium... I can't take this! Children run away and allyoutalk about is potatoes. Fine. We won't talk about potatoes. You should brush your teeth. You spoke! Nothing will ever change in this house because you ruin everything. You're so stupid and nice. Good night. Dear Heavenly Father, I've never prayed before. I'm sorry, I don't even know how. But I have to pray now. I'll start school in the fall - and our family's affairs are not in order. Mum doesn't want to be home. She'd rather have a job. And dad is just working. I guess his research isn't over yet. Most of all, I'm worried about my little sister. We're always together but I have to go to school. Quiltshoe will be all alone. Dear Heavenly Father, if I could make a wish... I wish our family were normal. That mum would like to be home - andthat she would bake buns wearing a pretty apron. I also wish dad would finish his research - so that he'd have time to play with us. I also wish - that mum and dad wouldtake good care of Quiltshoe - even though she can be horrible - so that I could go to school without worrying. Amen. Milk first. Andthen yeast. Thank you. Where's the yeast? Mum, it's here. - Morning, Hayflower. Morning. - Thank you. The yeast has to be soaked in warm water first. - What do you mean? That's what Halise Alibullen said. Otherwise the dough won't rise. Are you sure? - Yes. Halise taught me to bake. She said yeast has to be soaked. So Halise Alibullen taught that... - Yes. Then it's mixed with the milk. Did Halise teach that too? - Yes. Then you addthe flour. Halise probably taught that too? - No, Helga. Not that much! I won't speak to you! - Morning! Why don't you answer your mother? - She's not talkingto us. Yes I am! Morning! Come and see what mum made. Buns! I want one. - Don't! They are rising. Rising? - Halise's buns rose with time. Yeah! They were this big! At least everybody else's buns will rise. These are really good. Girls, come here. I know you wish I were a homemaker with an apron, smelling of baking - but this isn't working. I'm better suited for a job. - I hope you're not doing it. Well, I sure can't bake anything. The buns won't rise. - It'IItake time. Oh, yeah. Could we play while we wait? - Yeah! Sure. Let's try. This one the Alibullens don't know. I'll show you how. First, you fillthe balloons with water. Then youtie a knot at the end. Then to the balcony. More! Here. Thank you! Dear Heavenly Father, please let mum's buns rise so she'll be happy. Andthat she wouldn't get a job and stay home with us. Amen. The buns have risen! I know how to bake after all. What now? Maybe too much yeast. We should put them in the oven. Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for lettingthe buns rise. - Hayflower! How long shouldthey be in the oven? - Half an hour. Now let's go splashing! - What's that? Here, catch! Mum! - That's the idea. It can break any time. I don't want to get wet! - But it's fun! Mum, stop! - Catch. Mum, catch! - Oh my, the buns! It's wonderfulto be a child again. Let's throw them all off the balcony Hey, that's mine. - Here's a new one. What was that? Poor flowers... Did you do this? - No. We were throwing balloons. Is there someone else? - Yes. It was the other one's idea. Why would anyone hurt such beautiful flowers... That person didn't mean it. Pick a new bouquet. I can't go to Halise's looking like this. - Did she do something bad? I would like to meet the person who causedthis mess. Willthe person end up in jail? Hide. Bellybutton'll put you in jail - You didn't tell him I threw it? No. - Good. He's coming. Hide, quickly! - Help! Disturbing me is not allowed. No room for you! What's happening? - It's the police. He willtake mum to jail! - She will go to jail? What on earth is happening? - Your daughter soakedthe law. Hayflower wouldn't do that. It must've been Quiltshoe. No, it was the other person! - Who? Is there an unidentified person here? You are the police. You can't take mum to jail! ...this person didn't do anything criminal. You can't take mum to jail! Children must have a mum! Mum! - Open! You can't take mum to jail. - No. I deserve to rot in jail. I can't do the laundry or bake or even play with my kids. No wonder they prefer the Alibullens. I'm a lousy mother. The police can't put you in jail for that, can you? It's my fault mum can't bake. I prayed. Listen. The job of the police is to help, not to put you in jail. Willthe police help kids too? - Yes. The police are kids' friends. Are you sure? - Yes. I need help. I mean, dad's potato research is still not done. Hayflower! - How could I help? Don't bother the police. - But he said he'd help. That is the police's job... No one touches my potatoes. Who can do it better than me? Matt, she meant you should play with your children like other fathers. I don't understand. Doesn't the father play with his kids? You're not saying dad goes to jail? - No one is goingto jail. The police orders youto do something fun together as a family. Yeah! - Well, since you order it... What should we do? - How about sports? Let's holdthe family Olympics! - I'm goingto win! Winning isn't everything, fair play is. I always beat Hayflower. Quiltshoe is a good runner. - So am I. A runner carries the eternal Olympic torch to the stadium. Stop. - I'm practising bouncing. Why aren't you in bed? - No one's read me a bedtime story. Where's Hayflower? - Out in the yard. What is she doingthere? It's already dark. Dear Heavenly Father, had I known you were so clever- I would've prayed earlier. I'm sorry that I didn't. Otherwise I've been really good. I even let Quiltshoe win - even though I'm a lot faster. Even though Dad said that fair play is more important - please let me win the race because I've never won anything. Amen. Hayflower! - What are you doing? Ready, steady, go... Take the bar away! - Jump, Quiltshoe! Take the bar away! But the crossbar measures how high you can jump. I can't jump, it's in my way! - Just jump! Jump! - Let me show you how. Hooray! The butterfly style. - It's time for the race. I'll concentrate on hammer-throw. Everybody on the starting line! I don't want to run! Odd. The winner gets this bowl of sweets. Ready! Steady! Go! False start! Quiltshoe! - Come back! I won! - The result is not accepted! Back to the starting line. No restarts! I won! Give me the bowl, stupid Garglemouth! You cheated. - You're slow! Ready! Steady! Hayflower cheated! - No, you pushed me. Constable, hold on to the girls. - Quiltshoe pushed me. You can hold on to me. Ready! Steady! Go! I'm pacing... At least she won't win. Let Quiltshoe win. - Oh my. I'm so tired. I can't go on. - Quiltshoe is going past us! Gold! Help! The gold medal for the race goes to Quiltshoe. She tripped me. Don't take it so seriously. It's only a game. Congratulations. Stupid race. - Don't complain. You're a big girl. Look how happy Quiltshoe is since we let her win. This is unfair. You can't do that in the Olympics. Quiltshoe is so small. Try to cheer up. We're having fun together for once. We're serving refreshing strawberry punch in our garden. Sports releases you and makes you more sensitive to other people. Cheers. Let's toast! You can have a sweet. - Not interested. You can borrow this. - Keep your stupid medal. Ok, then. Why do you have that? You're not a winner! The winner carries the olympic torch! - You didn't win anything! I did! You're just slow! - I'll beat you! Mum, Hayflower hit me! - Give me the torch, you brat! Mum! Mum! What happened? - Open your eyes! I don't feel a pulse. - Calm down. We know CPR. We tendto the injured then we findthe culprit. No sign of injury. - Strange. What exactly did happen? Mum's here. What did Hayflower do? - I didn't do anything. We'll investigate. No one will be accused without evidence. She screamed Hayflower hit her. - Hayflower's not violent. This is unlike Hayflower but Quiltshoe provoked her. But you shouldn't hit anyone. - I didn't. Should I call an ambulance? - A doctor. She may have concussion. Will she go to the hospital? - No! Breath deeply. Right. She's healthy as a horse. Not a scratch. Stupid doctor! It hurts so bad. It hurts. - Serves you right. Mum, Hayflower is teasing. - Hayflower, shut up. The patient needs rest so be quiet. Do you hear me? Is the patient OK? Do you need anything? First, some gummy bears and later some ice cream. OK. Knock before you enter. Could you go and buy some ice cream? - I can't. My research is not done. What should we get instead? Pancakes? Hayflower, can you make pancakes? I can do it myself. Brlng me ice cream! -We don't have any! I'll make pancakes. No pancakes! I wantice cream! She wants ice cream. Could you go and buy some? I ask youto do somethingthis once and you sulk! I don't usually ask youto help with the housework! You could at least clear this mess! I can't get out of bed. We have to play here. Do you hear me? Bring my toys! Mum, Hayflowerwon'tplay withme! Hayflower! Now listen, Lord! I know it was wrong of me to ask youto let me win But this is so unfair. I'm not goingto talk to anyone - because I'm tired of you all. Amen. I don't care you didn't get me ice cream. I'm getting a liquorice pipe. Did you hear me? I'm getting a liquorice pipe. Are you deaf?! You're too stupidto go to school. Do you hear me? They won't let you in. What a pity. Good night. That's a beautiful sight. Good night. They're like two peas in the pod. Hayflower stopped playing with Quiltshoe. - Really? But they're such good friends. - She hasn't said a wordtoday. She's nervous about school. - Oh, yes. Our little first-grader. Why is she taking it so seriously? - She's never complained. She's such an easy child. She's never made any demands. - She's eaten everything we've made. Even mouldy bread because she didn't want to offend me. She always puts others first. She's like a human thought, imperceptible. What should we do with Hayflower? She's still not talking. - Take her to a reform school. She has always behaved well comparedto you. I don't know her anymore. She's like you on your worst day. I've never refusedto talk. Mum, let's play together. I have to clear up this mess. Ask your dad. OK. Come play with me! I don't have the time. Play with Hayflower. She doesn't play with me anymore. Try to get Hayflower to speak so that I can work in peace. OK. Mum, I have nothingto do. - Help me with the housework. No, that's boring! Let's callthe Alibullens. They know how to make her talk. No. Those batty ladies have meddled with our family's affairs too much. I have an idea! I'IIteach Hayflower to talk. Oops. Take off your shoes in bed! You have a lot to learn. Look, this is an alphabet book. Repeat after me: Al-pha-bet book. Don't make faces at your teacher! Now behave. Today we're learningthe letter A. Repeat after me: A. You're so quiet. This isn't that hard. Repeat after me: Liquorice pipe, marshmallow - whipped cream, chocolate. Oh, that wasn't right. Chocolate starts with an O. You'll stay behind if you don't learn. The letter A is your homework. Here's the alphabet book. Bye, the teacher's leaving. I left Hayflower to do homework. We learnt the letter A. What's that? - It looks like paper. Oh, no! That's my alphabet book! My favourite book! - Enough of this nonsense! You're grounded. A kind child right! Youtore Quiltshoe's favourite book! Don't force Hayflower. Better not rush her. She'IItalk when she's ready. But she tore my alphabet book! - Really? She's troubled by school. She needs to be aired. Not like a carpet. We'IItreat her with a versatile therapy programme. - Dough therapy. Hayflower can't be aired, she's grounded. Grounded? The situation is worse. - Your family has a crisis. Mum, what's a crisis? What crisis? - The Alibullens said we have a crisis. They'll use dough therapy on Hayflower. - What therapy? What is therapy? I want to know! What therapy? - Dough therapy. She gets the chance to be a little child for once. She can make a big mess. Really? And of course dough! You sure make it better than I do! I want dough therapy too. - We start at dawn. Quiltshoe calledthe Alibullens! - My research is at a critical stage. Quiltshoe calledthe Alibullens! - She knows how to use the phone? Yes. Everybody tries to solve our family's problems! What? - Our child won't talk and you worry about work? I'm constantly interrupted! - What right do you have to do it - while we're tryingto solve our problems? Ourchild asked God forhelp to get you out ofyourchamber! You've neverhelped me! There's no fathernorhusband! Start a family with a potato! That's what you love! You're like a potato, a bore! Hayflower, could you help us? Oh, you're still mad. What are you doing? Stop, don't play with fire! She's speaking! - Great! What are you doing? - Boiling potatoes! You don't boil potatoes in a bathtub! - But our potato is so big! Have you added salt and dill? - Yes! Don't boil it. It's dad! - But we're hungry! Let's eat spaghetti! - We don't eat spaghetti! Potatoes are much healthier! - Dad! Dad! Dad! Hayflower is speaking. Mum, Hayflower is speaking! Hayflower is speaking! Dad! Dad! Hayflower is speaking. - Say mum. Say mum. Where did Hayflower get this potato? I want one too. Morning! It's time forthe therapy. I want to come too! Is someone goingto dough therapy? - Hayflower. I don't know what kind of nonsense it is - but school starts tomorrow and we have to get Hayflower to talk. Take the potato in your left hand andthe brush in your right. Then scrub it until it's spotless. Why does a bad kid get dough therapy and good one scrubs potatoes? I see you're scrubbing potatoes. My, it's clean in here. - It only took half the night. Let me show you how to scrub. - You're helping with the housework? They should be the same size so they'll be ready at the same time. Listen. You spend so much time in your study - that I almost forgot how handsome you are. Too big. Bang! There is different-coloured dough in these vats. Do what you want. You can make a mess like a little baby. That way you'll learn to speak. Look! Ladidadidadi! Bear, bear, bear. The baby's tryingto say hair. She doesn't seem to understand. - It's early. Let's encourage her. Cap, cap. Dock, dock. Look. Pog, pog. Does she want to be a pig? - A clean girl like her? A flog? That's not a frog. It's Quiltshoe. What are you doing here? Are you hungry? Where's Quiltshoe? Always use a toothpick, or they break. Too much water. - Maybe she joinedthe therapy? Not enough water. Inaccuracies in boiling potatoes irritate me greatly Did you hear me? Where's Quiltshoe? - One thing at a time. Quiltshoe! Can't you be quiet for once? Now there's enough water. Now it's time to talk about Quiltshoe. What did you say? "I stoppedtalking. Hanna." Really? I'll bet you start talking before the potatoes are ready. Hanna! Hanna! Hayflower is making progress. She made contact with the primordial dough. She's using blue, the colour of peace and harmony. Maybe she wants to - make peace? Sometimes patients regress but don't let that bother you. Trust the dough therapy! Hello, sir! No manners at all. What if the Kettlefalls suffer from a disease causing muteness? In any case the therapy didn't work and I don't want any more patients. Yet another Kettlefall... Is Hayflower speaking? - Atalking Kettlefall! Am I the only one stilltalking? What's the matter with you? Hey, I came out of my study and made lunch. What's so bad about that? Hayflower, I made the toy potato for you. Fine. Let's all be quiet. Matt, now it's self-service in dough therapy. Take some dough and do what you like. Maybe silence is not a badthing. No one is screaming or arguing or saying something bad. Poo-poo. Coo, coo? Shit! - Don't swear! This is stupid! I want to start talking! I'm sorry I said a bad word. - That's OK. You can be angry if others are unfair. Let's go home. The potatoes are getting cold. - I want spaghetti! We don't eat that. - Yes, we do! Quiltshoe speaks too. - Not until I get spaghetti! Me too. - I want spaghettitoo. Maybe this once. - No! At breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day! Yes! Help, police! It is flying all over! What is happening? - The dough therapy worked. They are speaking again. There's plenty of dough. Make buns. The constables, too. Yes! - I hope they won't be disappointed. I don't know my way around a kitchen. - Don't be silly. I think they're better off with you. They talk about you. You play with them unlike a certain boring dad. Listen. You're both busy. You can't do everything. We'll help. There's no shame in that. Hanna, if you don't like housework, get a job! We can look after Quiltshoe, if you like. Of course we can't replace her parents and we don't want to - but as your neighbour aunties we're the best. We're the greatest. Guess what? - What? The person I spit at is my best friend. You're my best friend. - And you're mine. I'm sorry I cheated in the race. - It's OK. I'm sorry I tore your book How could you say such a bad word? Adults won't learn anything if kids are always nice. Listen, Hayflower? - What? Willyou be an adult when school starts? No, but someday I may not want to play with dolls. Girls, come and get some buns! Say cheese. Say cheese. I want to take pictures. Let's go over it one more time. Can you peel potatoes? - Yes. Andtie your shoelaces? - Yes. I forgot the pencil case! Do you know how to tie your shoelaces? - Yes. I have to go or I'll be late. - OK. Here. Do you have everything? - Yes. Bye. - Bye bye. Bye bye. Our little girl is at school. Time sure does fly. Soon she'll be an adult. Matt, we don't have a little girl anymore. Hey, you have me and I'm never goingto grow up!
