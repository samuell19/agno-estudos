She is dead She was killed when Tie-our robbed the fortress 10 years ago. Tie-our! At that time, he was lawless. When our master gave the order to arrest him, we never thought... He has been in hiding. Nobody has heard from him since then. Our master resigned from his position. and dedicated himself to hunting Tie-our. Hui-fun was left alone at the house. Who is Miss Hui-fun? Miss Yun's daughter The one who rode in the carriage with Yun at the temple. Won't you take a seat? Let me get you something to drink. Never mind. Where does she live? She lives in the Willow Garden. Oh, God! What happened? The master has been murdered by someone. Miss! Master! Miss! Miss! Chilung Miss, we have a visitor here.

Miss Miss Yun gave this jade to him It was stolen by Tie-our that night. Miss Yun was killed then. The master was injured and his face was burned. What jade caused my dad's death this time? Miss, take it easy. You should take care of yourself. Who was the murderer anyway It's despicable. You must take care of yourself You're the only one left in the Ho family. So I won't mourn again when this funeral is over. I must find that Tie-our who killed my dad. Yes, we must find Tie-our and get even with him. Only if you've made up your mind It's all trouble for you. I don't deserve to die. I'll follow you. But, that Tie-our is a sharp guy I don't think you... Go and bribe the best hands in the business. Even if I have to sell all my estate. How about me? How much will you pay? You're such a yellow dog, Erhfutzu I wonder how her mother treated... You'd know something for sure. I was determined to do it for Miss Yun. But, now the young lady wants to pay... So I'm obliged to ask the question It sounds... as if you've got something. You... Scabbed Tiger. So you're the famous Scabbed Tiger. I've heard you were a chivalrous man. and fight for the poor and the good. But it's too bad you were a little late. Otherwise, our master wouldn't have been killed. Erhfutzu Would you help me avenge his death? No The thug Tie-our is a personal vendetta. My reason for being is to end his life. It doesn't matter as long as you can. I'm true to my words. You'll get half of my estate when you finish Are there more such jades in your house? Only one piece. One was given to me by your mistress. Where did your father get the other one? After the death of my mother Father redeemed it from a silver shop in the white-wall town when it happened. Which silver shop? Tin-poa Silver Shop. Sir, what can I do for you? Was this jade sold by your shop? I'm not sure, I'm new here. Then bring the shopkeeper here. Master! This gentleman would like to speak... Sir This jade was purchased from here. He wanted another one to make a pair. I want to know if you still have... Sir, this was sold out long since... We don't have this style anymore. But where did you acquire it? It was sold to us by an antique dealer What was his name? Yenmaring! Ah, Scabbed Tiger! He said he wants to see... And he is waiting outside Let him in. Yes sir Please... It's truly a pleasure to have you here. Welcome, welcome Excuse me for dropping by unannounced Oh, you're welcome. Won't you have a seat? I'd like to seek your advice. Oh, yes, I'm glad to assist. I'm curious if you know about this? Well, it's the real deal. Certainly, it's the best in its field. The keeper of the Tin-poa silver shop said that it was sold to him by you years ago. By me? No, I don't think so I'm afraid he made a mistake We've been out of this line for ages. It's wrong, but this one was great It's a pair, but one of them is missing. He wants to redeem it at a high price Could you help me with the transaction? I promise you a great reward. I'm not dealing in jewellery anymore. I wish I could help you but I can't Alright, thank you for your help Good-bye! Just a minute, Chivalry! We've got other good jade. Feel free to have a look if you'd like. OK! Please! Please Please Please How about those jades All are great. This one is from the Han Dynasty. The best, without equal. You can keep it as a memento. It's not much of a gift. Mr. Yen, you've misunderstood. I never take anything without working for it. And I have a passion, to make friends with people like you. Please keep it, don't worry. I'm sorry, I can't oblige you. I'll visit you another day. Hey, Chivalry! It's better to mind your own business, What? A rattle snake wants to bite? Someone in the alley behind this silver shop? Just hand it for the other one That means you're the nosy one, not me. OK. I dare you! It's raining cats and dogs. The road... Then you have to be careful Rattle snake! Good move! Good move! Look at this. What do you think? Good, it's quite superb, isn't it? Sure, I've been through a lot. Be careful, Scabbed Tiger was here today. Why? I'm looking for him for revenge. He's been hindering my business. Thank you for these items. So, all his jewels came from you. You, sir. Just relax. Speak up! Did you buy this jade from him? - This... - So what? What do you want from me? Did you murder the old woman in the temple? Do you intend to stand against me? In the name of chivalry, Let's get straight to the point, what do you want? Listen! That old woman was my mother. I just want to settle the score with you. Fair enough! So do I! Don't get excited, you two. To tell the truth! Thank you for eliminating this villain. He's dead, there's no need to talk about it. This Juphon was the man who was called Red Whirlwind. Tie our. Having so many grudges against people He did nothing but hide his head and tail until all his money was used up, then he changed his name and started this business. His nickname was Red Whirlwind. He was known for his business in the jungle. In order to keep it in memory He translated "Red" into "Ju", and "Whirlwind" into "Phon". The name Red Whirlwind, came from the mole on his neck. Erhfutzu... what happened to you? Miss, miss Miss What is it? Quickly, fetch the Miss. Yes Get something to stop the bleeding. Are you all right? Erhfutzu What's the matter? You're hurt. This is the hair of Red Whirlwind. I killed him! He finally got what he deserved. Wait a minute. Erhfutzu It's late and you're injured. You should stay here tonight. I'll help you to the side room to take the medicine Ma, I've taken out Red Whirlwind. All right, you can rest now. Chilung! Chilung! Get this quilt for him And take good care of him. I'm living in the room opposite. Just call me if you need anything. This is the hair of Red Whirlwind. And I defeated him... Make way kid! Does it hurt? Not at all Hui-fun is entrusted to you! You must... Mother! Erhfutzu! Come on, let's get out of here Mother! Miss, Miss! What's happened, Chilung? Erhfutzu's condition is deteriorating. Erhfutzu... come back to us. Erhfutzu... come back to your senses Erhfutzu... Are you alright? Erhfutzu... Erhfutzu... Chilung, fetch a doctor quickly. Yes Erhfutzu... Miss, take a break and leave it to us No, it will be done soon Miss, Miss! You're not getting better, Why are you getting up! It doesn't matter, I'm fine, Lie down, quickly, Let me have them prepare dinner, Hey, folks, I have good news, Being famous in the jungle The Red Whirlwind, Tieour, has been killed by someone, Didn't you know? Are you kidding? The Red Whirlwind was too strong to be killed, How is that possible? Da, we'd better stop all this. Right or wrong, it happened in the past, or we'll get into trouble, It's certainly true, It's already happening in our town, Oh, yes, one night, When I was out patrolling, I saw two shadows fighting, one wearing red robes, must have been the Red Whirlwind, the other in black clothes struck, the Red one's head suddenly fell off, It's a complete fabrication, What's going on in your mind now? Nothing! Erhfutzu Your upset worries me every time, What are you thinking anyway, Nothing! There's something I want to show you, Related to the two of us... You mean... About your father! You've found the murderer? Erhfutzu, you are truly kind, What are you chopping the bamboo for? To make a crossbow, Now that the Red Whirlwind is dead, It's time to give me half of your estate Didn't you say you were doing this for the people? Why are you going back on your word? It's common sense. Nobody dislikes money, So you're also after money! OK, I'll give it to you as soon as you finish, What do you say? OK. It's a deal Father, the Red Whirlwind has been killed. Erhfutzu has found the murderer The daughter will avenge her father. Set up the crossbow when we get there. I have made an appointment with him. This man is a sharp one. Please give me a hand. If I'm defeated, he will go through the valley. You can ambush him there. When he comes, shoot the 9 arrows. Good, with this I can kill him. But I'm sure you won't be defeated. It's difficult to say. It could happen to anyone. It's late. Go to bed now I'll stay until it's finished. Make sure the arrows kill him. The sharper they are, the faster he'll die. You two lie in ambush here. Shoot the arrows as soon as possible. But make sure it's him ...I'll go with you No, you can't I want to see him die myself. Stay here, in case you need to finish it. I... Miss! You'd better stay here I believe you will beat him. Erhfutzu! You must be careful! Erhfutzu! Erhfutzu! Erhfutzu! Erhfutzu! Miss... Look! He is wearing a white robe It's not Erhfutzu! Miss, he's getting closer He's here. Shoot! Alas! it's Erhfutzu! Erhfutzu! Erhfutzu! Erhfutzu! How can it be you? Erhfutzu! Erhfutzu! Now your revenge is complete. No, it can't be you Did you kill my father? It's impossible Why have you done this? Erhfutzu! Why? For this? Erhfutzu, why didn't you tell me before? Why? Why?
