'Madurai' 'He considers himself to be a genius.' 'With the intelligence I have, I should have been in America.' 'He thinks himself to be smart..' What does he think of himself? Here, we are sitting with our heart in our mouth and there, he's busy flirting with that girl. Should love be his priority now? You're the one spoiling him. If anything happens to him you will be dead. Which area? - Tallakulam. Start the car. Sit down. You go ahead, I'll pick up the mutton pancake I'd ordered for. We don't want anything. Just hop on! - Hey! Don't raise your voice at me and stop treating me like a kid. You are controlling me all the time! Let me see who attacks me! Let it be. - Hey! Take your hands off! Leave him. He's a big shot now! He can take care of himself. Come and sit. Hey, how.. - I said, sit! Go with him. Why do you keep fighting? - Do you have any liquor? I'll deal with you later. 'Bone of Contention' That guy is dragging the bike. Forget the bike. Let us escape. Come soon. Be in hiding for two days. Don't get caught by the police. Okay, boss. - Go in four different directions. None of us should get caught. Okay, boss. - Run, run. - Come back only when I tell you. Lift him. Hey! Hey! Give a hand. Lift him up. Hurry up. Start the auto. Make him lie down on the seat. Come here. - Aarumugam.. What happened? Carry him. - Carry him. - Carry him. Get him inside the auto. - Hey! Hey, careful. Tie a cloth to stop the bleeding. - Oh, no! - Pazhani! Carry him. They have killed this innocent man. How will I face his family? 'Few days back.' Goddess Meenakshi! With your grace, we've succeeded in whatever we've laid our hands on. This time too, we should reap golden rewards with Your blessings! Who are you? Where are you from? You seem to have brought something? We're from 'Vijay and co.', ma'am. They had ordered for a cupboard, but the house is locked. They've gone to school. I have the key. I'll give it to you. Watch your step. Move it carefully. Careful. Watch the floor. Slowly. Carefully. Careful, ma'am. We'll take leave, ma'am. Bye. - Bye. My back bone is knotted! 'He considers himself to be a genius.' Hello. - Finished the job? Couldn't you get a taller cupboard? My back is aching. This is all we could get for the time being. We'll have to cut a palm tree to make one, to accommodate you in! Hang up now, I'll call when I'm done. Lefty lout! Why worry when You are there to protect me? God, protect me from all risks. Heights of intelligence! They think, they've hidden the keys in the cleverest cubbyhole! 'Wow! What a haul!' Ask him the status. Speak. - Dude, he's loaded. I think, he is a loan-shark. He has loads of money. It's all 1000 rupee bundles. I'm done, come soon. We'll be there right away. He's done with his job. Ma'am, we delivered at the wrong address. The cupboard should be delivered at Suraiyur. But we delivered it at Subramaniapuram. You men are being such a nuisance! Please help us. Okay, come with me. At least, now, deliver it to the right owner. Okay, ma'am. 'Thefts of this kind are becoming common in Madurai.' 'The police have given an assurance to nab this gang at the earliest.' 'People of Madurai are now living in constant fear of theft.' 'Along with cameraman, Senthil this is Udayarani for Kalaignar news.' Both of us worked so hard to save all that money! Some thief came and stole everything! What do we do now? We've lost everything! Sir. Sir.. You are applying powder and checking. If the thief had worn gloves how can you get his fingerprints? You! Looks like you are on the thief's side! It seems as if they had invited the thief to their house. Instead of breaking into the house the thieves seem to have been handed the keys on a platter! Who is to blame? These people. Who is the lady of the house? - This lady. Where do you work? I'm a teacher in Paalvadi. Who else are there at home? The kids get back from school. So, we give the keys to this lady who is our neighbor. Bring this old lady to the police station for interrogation. 'Cupboard-pulling thieves are rampant in Madurai now.' 'Police are on the hunt.' - Dude! Looks like even if the showroom delivers their cupboards hereafter people will panic! - Yes. Absolutely. Thieves have multiplied in every nook and corner. You be careful. No one will ever order for a cupboard! Read out what is this week's prediction for Leo sun sign. There he goes again! People born under Leo sun sign.. Your future is bright. Good events are round the corner. Good news will come your way. Not good news. It's bad news! - What? What do you mean? - Take a look. Dude, escape! - Run, run for your life. Ice candy! Ice candy! Oh, God! Oh, God! Hello! Hello! Someone, lend me a hand! A girl is lying injured here after meeting with an accident! Save this girl. Come soon! Come soon. Come on. I asked you to track the thief with our sniffer dog. Instead, you've admitted a girl at the hospital! 1000 thieves can escape but an accident victim should be saved. You and your word play! Who will answer our boss? Go! My chain has got stolen, sir. Chain snatch incident? Which area? Don't make me blush, sir. You idiot! From which area did your chain get stolen? Sokkikulam. Is it Sokkikulam? Okay, I'll enquire. Go! Your moustache looks very nice, sir! Get lost! 'Get started.' They are the cupboard-pulling thieves! Don't let them escape. Catch them!

Why is he scratching his head? Saravana? What is it? - This is the right time. Everyone is running around. All the houses are empty. Let's do our job. I'm in no mood. - Really? No house is closed. Let us steal. I am in no mood to steal. Leave me alone. This isn't an international business. Do you need a mood to steal? Come on. Bucket.. They are serving food for free at the adjacent street. Really? Is that so? Go. Gobbling glutton! I don't want to get my ears pierced. - Don't be scared, it won't hurt. Occupy the place. Move aside, ma'am. Where's my girl? Let the flies not eat your food! Excuse me, your face looks so familiar! But I'm unable to recollect. Do you remember seeing me? Hey! How dare you touch me without even thinking that I'm a girl! I'll deal with you outside, once you finish your lunch. Hey, gobbling glutton! Did you eat to your heart's content? As if you let me eat in peace! Sit carefully. Be on your guard for few days. An inspector has been transferred here from Tirunelvelli. He looks terrorizing. He'll shoot you in an encounter, if you oppose him. He'll be dealing with your cash. Why will he deal with our cash? Is he an accountant? Don't be a school master! I meant our case, the complaint. He was with Aarusamy. He sports a handlebar moustache like actor Surya in the film 'Singam'. Be careful. Looks like he is up to no good. Shall we peel his skin or make him pee? I'm being serious and you're making fun of me! Bucket, tell him, we taught Shakespeare to write 'Taming of the shrew'! This 'inch' is zilch to us. Give us the address. Stubborn people! No.13, 4th cross street, Subramaniapuram. You've just arrived and you're already receiving a call. Change your dress first, let's eat. Hello! Can I speak to the inspector from Tallakulam? Who is this? - We supply buffaloes to the Lord of death! Who the heck are you, man? - That's not important. We heard a lot about you. I believe, you intend to catch the cupboard-pulling thieves. Try your luck. - Are you acting smart with me? Why are you getting tense? Note down this address. - Tell me. 13, 4th cross street, Subramaniapuram. 'Why have you noted down our own address, dear?' Your wife is very smart! She has observed it correctly. Open your cupboard. Oh, God! They've stolen all my jewels. My jewelry! I can see the next house! - I'll take a look. Cop's cash kaput! I'm so confused. The bar I'd dragged and brought here.. Where are they pushing it to? Excuse me. May I know, what you are doing? Can't you see for yourself? We are pushing the bar. This is the 'no entry' zone. How can you say it so casually? This is public property. Won't the common people question your move? Tomorrow, after coming here, I'd have been disappointed not to see the bar. Cheers! Brother.. You say, it is a 'no entry' zone. Can't you show the right way and lend me a hand in pushing? Sorry, brother. I can't do that. My wife said that the temple is too far from our house. I pushed it gradually and have just now, shifted it near my house. I'm very tired. You push it. Push it. Why are they pushing the empty bar? Go straight and take the second right. Don't wonder, why I'm walking so fast. The boys are pushing the bar so fast. Get lost! - I'll take care of the bottle. I'll return the money, sir. 'I have a family.' - 'When you want money' 'you fold your hands.' - 'Please forgive me.' 'When I ask you to repay it, you raise your hand at me!' 'Cut his hand.' - 'Don't, sir.' 'How dare you!' What's this? Can't you see? It's called 'upma'! You know, I don't like this. Why have you served me this? Serve me something else. I'll punch you. You're so thin. I've made lamb curry to eat along with it. At least, you'll put on some weight. If I hate something, I don't change my mind about it. You and your husband can stuff all the meat you want! Don't aggravate my anger. What temerity! - Hey! Why are you screaming at night? - She acts like a son. She troubles me so much. She and her temper tantrums! She's throwing away the plate at the wall! Why do you provoke her? You know, she hates 'upma'! You want me to hit my only child. Hitting her is equivalent to disrespecting God! Why do you defend her so much? I pity the boy who marries her! Where are you taking me? Why are you torturing me by bringing me here this early in the morning? Who is this clown? He's blinding me! Keep quiet. - Wasn't I telling you about your sister? She is the one. I don't have a sister, dude. - Dude, I meant to say.. The angel who hugged me.. The girl in the yellow skirt. She is beautiful, dude! Thanks, dude! - You're hitting on the perfect one! You are really great. Did you realize that only now? Okay, don't just stand here. Go and talk to her. - Okay. Look there. They are discussing you. He's coming here. He'll come here and blabber. 'She does not look educated.' - He's right next to you now. Is it so? - Excuse me! You look familiar to me but I'm unable to recollect. Do you remember seeing me? Tell me. 'She is not responding.' 'I do look handsome.' The color of your dress matches with his. Shut up. Dude! - Yes. She is not responding. What else do you expect with that expression of yours? Which girl will respond? How else to speak? Like a flower, you should smile and talk to girls. Is that how you smile? Have you ever seen anyone 'smile like a flower'? You.. - Cool! Cool! Cool, dude. Go and try your luck again. Go on. 'Smile like a flower'? Fine, I will smile that way. Good morning, sister. - What's the matter? Nothing, sister. - Am I your sister? If male cops are called brothers-in-law then, female cops are sisters, right? - I will thrash you. Buddy, run! They are after us, wherever we go! Who is this buffoon? Why is he running so fast? His face is so familiar but somehow, I'm not able to recollect! Let's go. Good morning, sir. - Did you identify the caller? We traced the call to a fruit shop. Did you ask the shopkeeper? - The shop is closed, sir. Come in with the file. Aarumugam, Saravanan, Pazhani, Senthil. These four are notorious thieves, sir. How many thefts have happened in our area? Seven and including your house, the count is eight, sir. Robbery in the seven houses happened during daytime. Your house alone was robbed at night, sir. Which area has the maximum thefts? Sokkikulam. - Let's go. 'They robbed you by breaking into your locker from the rear.' 'How will your disguise help?' 'They are giving all the cops a run for their salary!' Will they try their smart moves on me? 'You think, I can't see through your disguise?' 'I know how to handle you.' - Put few milk packets also. 'They'll soon offer milk to your grave!' Senthil.. The matter is getting serious. What are you looking at? Fatso, I'm reading important headlines. - Stop it. Be careful. That inspector and that constable are delivering newspapers door to door. Be careful. - Why are they delivering newspapers in our area? Newspapers will pile up and we'll go in to steal, thinking that no one is at home. They'll nab us. So, stop stealing. Hey! How can we give up our profession? I'm only asking you to change the area. Which area? - Meenakshipuram. Enter the kingpin's house. Nobody will be around. They are discussing the temple festival plans. No one will be around until dusk. Let's go. My grandfather and his forefathers have protected this temple for generations together. The ceremony performed in this temple is the respect shown to my forefathers. - Stop it! You can't fool me the way you fooled my father. I'll do the honors for the temple festival. Do whatever you want. It's not you or me who will decide as to who will do the honors. God will decide it this year. Are you trying to challenge me? I'm not challenging you. I swear by the Goddess we all pray to. Greetings! - Who are you? Why did you come via the rear entrance? Why are you at the back yard? What do you want? We are from 'Mannar and Company'. We've been asked to deliver a cupboard here. Is it my boss who has asked? Yes. - Okay, bring it in. If we don't get to conduct the temple festival this year there's no point in us living. Sir! - What? Two men from 'Mannar and Company' have delivered a cupboard. Cupboard? - Yes! They said, you've ordered for it. Me? - Yes, sir. "The tiger roars, growls, snarls. Thunder claps, crashes, rumbles." "The flags in truce, flutter on seeing the hunter enter." "Intestines quake, tremble and shake." - Boss.. This must be their work. - "The flags in truce, flutter" "on seeing the hunter enter." - Fetch our weapons. "The tiger roars, growls, snarls. Thunder claps, crashes, rumbles." Open that cupboard. - "The flags in truce, flutter" "on seeing the hunter enter." Intestines quake" "tremble and shake. The flags in truce, flutter" "on seeing the hunter enter." "Look at the hunter coming with pride." Answer the call. "The prey runs in fear." Are you done? Yes, I'm done! Even I've read about the cupboard-pulling thieves. But I never imagined, you'd dare to steal from my house! Conmen to the core! The cops are searching high and low for you. That's why, we thought, we'd catch hold of one last haul and settle down in life. But he got caught! I'm giving you an assignment because of your intelligence. It's the most challenging contract. It's the lion's den where 1000 will be roaming around with sickles. If you are not careful along with my dignity getting tarnished all of you will get killed too. Hey! Eat! If you aren't alert even for a moment you will die. Try your best. Even my men will be there. But in case, you get caught my men will hack you to death. If you can't, let me know. We'll assume this to be one good feast, we had together. We won't easily get our hands dirty. When we do, we deliver. How much do you want? - We'll protect your dignity. You decide how much to pay us. Be alert. Not a single outsider should step into our area. They shouldn't get away! "Any kind of opposition, be ready for friction." "Any interference, lock horns in self-defence." "If anyone has a bone to pick, flare up double quick." "Any meddling, muddling, don't spare." "Wrestle and tussle. Treble trouble." "Button yet to be pressed to immerse in this ruckus." "Crackers go bonkers. Conflict conquers." "If four friends get together, broil, bicker, fight boils over." You guys are amazing! I'm getting goose bumps. I'm stunned. You did the impossible! Well done! Mani.. Give the boys Rs.1 lakh. Let them be happy. Okay, sir! - Hey! Just one lakh? Without consulting us how can you fix the rate? - How much do you want? Dude, shoot. It's.. - We owe our regular tea shop owner, Rs.520. He asks for it whenever I go there. Ask for that too. How petty can you be! - Hey! What are you muttering over there? Five lakhs only. What? Five lakhs? - Yes. Initially, I'd intended to pay you only Rs.50,000 but since you've taken such a huge risk I decided to be generous enough to give you an additional Rs.50,000. Are you demanding for Rs.5 lakhs? - Sir. They are young boys. Why are you even giving them an explanation? See if you are even able to count till 1 lakh. - Hey! I even know to count the number of bones in your body! Hey! How dare you raise a hand at my friend? Hey! How dare you play dirty games with us! If you cheat us I'll burn you alive! We came to lend you a helping hand whereas you're hitting us. - Hey! Those chaps are hitting our boss, get your weapons. Come on. Take the sickle. Do you consider us to be beggars? We've saved your respect, dignity, pride and prestige. We put our lives in danger to do your job. We give our lives a s***. If I tell them that the statue is in your house the walls of your house won't remain intact. They will demolish the entire house. One who honors his word is a real gentleman! Pay us the right amount. If we could take the statue we won't hesitate to take you! Mani. Go in and get Rs.5,00,000 lakhs. Hey! If I wish, I can hack you to pieces right here. But.. You had the courage to enter my house and attack me! I'm sparing your lives only because the statue is in my house now. Hey! I've paid you what you asked for. But I won't forget your assault on me. You are answerable for that. Let us know, when to answer. We'll fix a rate for that too! We will take your leave. Come. 'One who honors his word is a real gentleman!' 'Pay us the right amount'. 'If we could take the statue' 'we won't hesitate to take you either!' Sir! Let's be patient. Four kids. Four kids came to my house and hit me. They should regret all their life for hitting me. Yes, Bucket. - Oh! They are here only. Okay. Hey! What is this? Why is he dressed up like actor Vishal in the film, 'Avan Ivan'? Hey! Pazhani! I think, he's under the influence of black magic. Get him exorcised! Come with me. Bucket wants us. He thinks, he is actor Ramarajan's heir! Dude. - What? I don't know if my girl will accept my love. I don't know why but the very thought of her electrifies my body, dude. We shouldn't hesitate at all. We are not answerable to anyone. Directly go to her and ask her, how she feels about you. But I'm terrified to go and ask her that. Why are you terrified? You have robbed so many houses so easily. Don't you know to steal a girl's heart? Profess your love to her. I'll also come with you. But how do I do that? Dude, your girl is coming. Your guy is standing there. Do I look okay? Absolutely handsome! Ignore him. I need to talk to you in private. Are you eve-teasing us? Hey, you! Muck face! Dude, deal with them. Hey, muck face, come here. I'll get you something to eat. Let's go. - Come here. Stand aside. I'm trying to recall. I can remember everything else except for that incident. What's your problem? Why are you following me unnecessarily? Will a boy follow a girl without any reason? Every time I think of you, my heart starts pounding hard! I think, I'm in love with you. Go away from here. If my father gets to know, he'll kill you. I'll handle it. I know, risk is involved. And I'm ready to take that risk. Forget that. Just tell me if you love me or not. I have no such feelings. Leave. You lied to me, didn't you? I felt your love when you hugged me. I'm so 'kappy'! Dude, she hugged me. I'm so 'kappy'! What's wrong with him? He's laughing weirdly. He's acting so weird. He's in love with a beautiful girl. She is that loan-shark, Rajendran's daughter. She hugged him today. Really? Oh! That's what he is recalling! Saravana falling in love with a rowdy's daughter is dangerous. First, she'll ruin the business and then, she'll ruin our friendship. Especially, don't trust these girls from Madurai. Either like actress Sandhya in the film 'Kaadhal' they will marry someone else and make you loony.. Super performance! Or like actress Swathi in 'Subramanipuram' they'll betray you and get you killed. Be careful. Yes. We'll then, have to roam around with sickles to take revenge. Hey! Why are you maligning my girl for no reason? Hey, come here. Go. He'll share a military secret with you. Go. Aarumugam have you heard of 'as thick as thieves'? That suits them well. They're degrading my love. You are not defending me. And you call yourself my friend? Won't you support me? - Dude.. I was doing just that. Just like I supported you when she hugged you I was discussing of ways to get you united. Thanks, dude. Dude. I must share a secret with you. Tell me. Hey! This looks new. Where did you steal this from? This belongs to my girl. Out of sheer habit, I flicked it, when I hugged her! That's heights of professionalism! You didn't think twice before stealing from the girl you love. That proves, how much you respect your profession. Dedication to your job is very important! Like how Actor Vijay gave a chain in 'Kadhalukku Mariyadhai' to prove his love I'll unite you both with this chain. I'll unite you both. Thanks, dude. Hey! Her face is familiar, but.. Back to square one! - I'm unable to recollect.. You? Dude! Dude! I am unable to eat or sleep properly. I'm even unable to steal! Don't take it literally. Darn my tongue for blabbering! You don't have to doubt my love at all. My love is confirmed. If you confirm too I'll be so happy. To have found me you are very lucky. Get lost, you idiot! This place is swarming with my father's goons. If they see you, they'll kill you. Get going! - This will do for me. You're concerned that your father's men will kill me. That concern is enough for me. I've come to know that I reside in your heart. Now, I won't disturb you at all. You go in and pray. I'll wait for you outside. Thank you, God. Hereafter, I won't steal from your cashbox! Who are you? You? - Come with me. Move. Come on. Don't hang around. I don't see him anywhere. Do you know, whom you are flirting with so openly? Hit him. Let's go. Looks like they have smashed my nose. Why has a crowd gathered here? Oh, God! - Oh, God! Buddy! Saravana! - Be careful. What happened? - I banged against a wall. Who? - You banged against the wall? - I've broken my nasal bone. Why couldn't you be careful? - Don't feel. Did you think, they would spare him if he flirts with loan-shark, Rajendran's daughter? That's why, he has got a broken nose now! Take him to the hospital. - Take him. - Go. Take him carefully. - Take him carefully. He came to the temple today. - Is it so? He looked really funny with sacred ash all over his forehead. Who are you? Why are you here? Hey! All of you, come out! Mom, why is the noise level at its peak today? If you indulge in slaughter and massacre the sounds are bound to be high decibel only! Your father's goons must be thrashing someone who hasn't repaid his money. Hey! Why is he running with a sickle in a fit of rage? Go and check. My daughter! Who are you? Let her go. Stop! Let go of me. I'll kill her. Are you a big shot? It's natural for boys to admire girls! So, will you send your men to hit him? Ask them to face me now. Do you think, he's an orphan? I'll hack you to pieces. What crime did he commit? Did he make you pregnant and then, ditch you? How dare you have him hit! I told you long back not to have anything to do with this female. Look! We have no family. But, you! I'll kill you without any hesitation. - Come. You'll be a corpse, unidentifiable. Let's go. - Let go of me. Where had you been? To your father-in-law's house! I'll break your bones. - Hey! Did I tell you that she was the reason, I got bashed up? Dude.. Be glad, she's still alive. He would've made her headless if I had not stopped him. Move aside. - Hey, hey. Senthil. Wait. You promised to unite us, instead, you're being a pain in the neck! I'll do anything for your love. But if they dare to hit you I will be the first one to attack. I'll kill the whole lot of them. To heck with your love story! What happened? We hit a boy in the temple who had misbehaved with your daughter. In retaliation, his friends came here and hit us. Which area? I saw them at the temple. Welcome home, big shot! Who are those scumbags? Some guys threatened to kill her with a sickle! Did I give birth to my only child to be slaughtered like a lamb? What's going on here? You twirl your moustache in pride. But they had the audacity to come here! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - Get lost! Go inside. All you know is to vent out your anger on me! - Vela! I'll go back to my mother's house. - Yes, sir. How dare they enter my house and threaten my daughter? Search the entire Madurai. Kill them as soon as you find them. - Okay, sir. Stop! What will you achieve by killing them? You are the cause for this problem. Wherever I go, you have men breathing down my neck. These blockheads are the culprits. He asked me the way to the shrine, that's all. They misunderstood it and broke his nose. Will his friends keep quiet? So.. They came and showed their might! End this matter here, dad. Even if there's some truth in what she said her eyes are lying! Kill them as soon as you find them. "Don't trust girls." "They are not trustworthy." 'He considers himself to be a genius.' 'With the intelligence that I possess' 'I should have been in America.' - Answer the call. 'He considers himself to be a genius.' Hello? I'm Saravanan. Are you? 'Even after getting beaten up, he won't stop talking in broken English!' Hello! Why silent? Talk me. I'm Meenakshi here. Meenakshi? Which Meenakshi? Whom you torture by saying, 'Excuse me, your face looks familiar'.. I am the same Meenakshi. 'How did she get my number?' Hello.. Hello? What a surprise call! I never expected this call. Meet me at Arthi inn tomorrow. Okay. Dude, my girl wants to meet me. Why do you think she's calling me? It could be to give fermentation to your wounds? We've seen this in so many films. Your love has begun! Her father will ask his goons to break my bones while she wants to bond with me? - That's right. Most of the times, fathers push the daughters to fall in love. All these days, when you followed her did she even acknowledge you? As soon as her father's thugs hit you sympathy made her love you. Fathers fan the fire of love, in children with no such thoughts. They should be killed first. It must surely be love. Go and enjoy. Enjoy. Super, dude! You are 'great knowledge'. Thanks, dude. - Okay. "Girlfriend of a burglar!" Excuse me. Your face looks so familiar. Do you remember seeing me? "Girlfriend of a burglar!" "Girlfriend of a burglar!" "You softened my tough heart." "You softened it."

Good afternoon. Excuse me. - 'This seems to be an expensive restaurant.' 'I'll probably burgle this place someday.' One veg-rice. - Okay. One gobi manchurian with gravy. - Okay. One sweet corn. - Okay. Two juice. - Okay, ma'am. Water melon. - Anything else, ma'am? One creamy pasta. - Okay, ma'am. Hey! Don't bring it fast. Make it slow. I have lots to talk. I'm Saravanan. What is your name? Meenakshi. - Meenakshi? Beautiful name! What is your father? Businessman. - Businessman. B. Meenakshi. Very good name. 'What is your father' means, what is his job? 'Then, why didn't you say that he is a loan-shark?' 'Let me handle this.' Sorry. It was a slip of the tongue. I should be the one apologizing to you. - Why? You keep saying that my face is familiar. Actually, even I feel the same. Really? All those who fell in love with me are in the graveyard now. That's why, I stepped back every time you approached me. Okay. Your friends support you like your backbone. Looks like they'll be ready to even die for you! To have such friends you should consider yourself to be truly blessed. - Thanks a lot. So, why don't you tell what you are supposed to? I love you! - 'Bravo! Congrats!' 'Bravo! Congrats!' 'Bravo! Congrats!' Hello, lunch is here. Have. I'd never imagined that you'd accept my love so soon! I have to give you this. You like? This.. This is my chain. Are you a thief? - Hello. Like the slip of my tongue, it slipped into my pocket that day. And you are calling me a thief! No, you are a thief! I had a doubt, when you hugged me the other day! Rascal! Are thieves such low-life to you? Who doesn't steal in this country? Is your father above board? Check that menu card to see the price of the 'idli'. Just check it. Rs.30. If they can sell Rs.2 worth 'idli' for Rs.30.. Isn't this robbery? You can buy 15 'idlis' for that money. Forget this. For a year, the Government can admit only 1,00,000 students for an engineering course. But they build more colleges and join 15,00,000 people and grab money from 14,00,000 people. What we do is blatant. They do it behind the scenes. That's it. Still, you should not bestow upon me, the title of a thief. I happen to be your lover. So? Isn't stealing a crime? Look, we are like income tax officers. We steal from the wealthy. They break open the wall. We break into a cupboard! I can't win any argument with you. - That's true. Finish eating and wash your hands. Where did he go? He must have gone to Mandhara's tea shop. Call him. - Aarumugam. Maybe he's in the bathroom. The bathroom door is open. 'He considers himself to be a genius.' He hasn't taken the phone. 'For the intelligence I possess' 'I should have been in America.' Hey, check if his lover's number is there. Her number is not there. Aarumugam, see if he's there at the tea shop. Hey, Mandhara.. Did Saravana come here? Yes. Some time back a girl took him along on her bike. - 'Bike?' Tell me. - He went with some girl on a bike. I guess, it must be his girl. He has gone with her again. He might get into some tussle. Go and look for him. Stop. - Talk to me with respect. I'll cut your throat! Wretch! I should have killed you that day itself. Where is Saravanan? - I haven't met him today. You are always suspicious of me. - Don't lie to me. I know about your rowdy family very well. Mind your tongue! Don't drag my father into this. Why should he hide Saravanan? If anything happens to Saravanan I'll annihilate your entire family. Tell me. He's back. He's happily lying down and relaxing. Come back home. When did he get back? Where had he gone? He had gone to the hospital. He got stuck in the lift because of power cut. How can we blame him for that? Who knows where he got stuck? Love is also like electricity. No one can predict if it will electrocute or exterminate! 'He considers himself to be a genius.' 'With the intelligence that I possess, I should have been in America.' 'He assumes..' Hello? - I'm Meenakshi speaking. I want to meet you. Come to Azhagappar Chettinad hotel tomorrow. I'll come wherever you ask me to come! Order whatever you like. - Aren't you having anything? I already had. Your father's goons. Bend down. Get up! - Bend down. First, get up! That's the end of my story. - Bala! Yes, ma'am. - Why are you here? I came for some take-away. - Okay. - Okay. Hello. Why did you call him? What if he informed your dad about us? That's exactly why I called him. Won't I hesitate to tell my father that I'm in love with a thief? That's why. You are a very bold girl. Obviously, how else, can I hang around with a thief like you? Can I ask you something? I hope, you won't misunderstand me. I'll never misunderstand you. God has given you two gifts. One is me and the other, your friends. Whom will you choose? - First, I'll choose this chicken! You are a scumbag, thief and an illiterate bumpkin. Despite knowing all this, I fell in love with you. But your friend hisses at me like a snake every time he sees me. He threatens me with a knife in broad daylight. I'll ask you to marry me and take you away from your friends. Why are you washing your hands? Saravana! Saravana! Stop, Saravana! Saravana! Stop! What have I spoken for you to walk off in anger? Listen, you asked me whom I will choose if God asks me to choose between the two of you. I'll choose my friends over you. They mean the world to me. He's just hinting to me to leave you. If he insists, I'll ditch you and walk away. If you dare to talk ill of them.. Get lost! I'm not getting any scape-goat today! - 'Ladies and gentlemen!' Got it! Welcome to my net! Right into my trap. 'Wow! Beautiful!' Crap! - Welcome to Madurai. I'm a guide. Do you want my services? Yes. - I'm Pitt. 'Fraud' Pitt. I'm Cruise. Tom Cruise. Nice name, sir. - Thank you. Look, sir, total Madurai inside. Nice. You have something else? What? - Tamil figure? Tamil figure? - Yeah. Really? - Yes! Foreigners love Tamil much more than we do! Sir, please come on. - Okay. These are the Tamil figures. A, B, C, D.. No, no. - What? Tamil figure! Tamil figure? - Yeah. We visit Goa to lure your girls while you come here to do the same, isn't it? You don't know about the girls in Madurai. They'll rip you off your shirt and hit you. What happened? - Nothing. I have three big figures. I'll introduce you, come. Thank you. 'You are the scape goat to be slaughtered.' I'm not getting any joker at all. The joker you wanted is right behind you! You bet, he has got hold of a proper joker! Who are all these? - They are my close friends. - Oh! Who is this foreigner? Where did you find him? In Star Movies. He wants Tamil girls. You speak fluent English. Ask him what he wants. What's your name? - I'm Cruise. Tom Cruise. And what's your name? - Lee. Bruce Lee. He Jet-Li. He Idli! - Hello, boss. Oh, really? Very funny. Did you say 'Panni', meaning pork? You idiot! All are funny. Oh, my God! 'Will you ever ask for a Tamil girl again?' Which place? - Temple area. Let's go. Hello, excuse me, give one packet. How much? - Rs.70. You change dollar? - String that dollar around your neck. Give me the cash first. - No Indian money! What you funny people! Funny shop owner! Get lost, you! - Watch your tongue! I sleep with explosives under my pillow! Idli, Jet Li, Bruce Lee.. There are three of them. They will break your shop. Turn back, you'll see Dong Lee from the film 'Ezhaam Arivu'. Dong Lee? Who is this Dong Lee? How dare you hit my friends! I'll kill you. Did you dare to hit a cop? Let's go. Catch him. Fast. This cap suits you better! - Fool! Untie me. Search Madurai's every street, every nook and corner. Find him and kill him. - Okay, sir. 'He considers himself to be a genius.' I'm at the bar. What is it? Forgive me. I didn't realize, your friends mean a lot to you. I want to see you. Drop by on your way home. I'm neck deep in a problem now. - What problem? We hit a policeman. The cops are hunting for us. I'll tell my father and ask him to handle it. I want to see you. Please! Don't cry. I'll be there. One more kilometer. Push, push hard. The cops are looking for us. Be on your toes. Hey! - Push with all your strength. Hey! Sorry, boss. I didn't know, you were inside. Forgive me. Without knowing that you're inside, I pushed the bar this far. Don't worry. Take my bike keys. - For what? I'll push this bar back only after two days. I'll take it from you then. For now, you can use my bike. Please go. - Fool! Giving his bike key to a thief! - I will take care. - Here. Come on! 'Don't raise your voice at me and stop treating me like a kid.' 'Take your hands off!' - Very tired. Small break. 'He's become a big shot. He can take care of himself.' I'm Kasinathan speaking. - Tell me. Those boys are heading towards Meenakshipuram. Will you hit a policeman? I'll show you, what a cop is capable of doing! Hey, careful! How will I face his family? We were following them down this bridge, sir. Suddenly, they switched off the light, killed him and ran away. Did any of you witness this? - No, sir. Where do you stay? - Third street, sir. Which area are you from? - Near the pond. None of you saw this happen? - No, sir. How atrocious! They've killed a police man. If policemen are not safe, how will the public trust the police? Did you get any information about the murderer? Four thieves, two of them are involved in this, sir. Find out all the details and arrest them immediately. Send this body for post-mortem at once. - Okay, sir. Sir! You.. Send the body for post-mortem and inform his family members. Yes, sir. - Don't miss out a single rowdy in Madurai. Chop their legs off and make them immobile. - Yes, sir. Bring the bike to the station. Pazhani.. Why are you crying? Don't cry. If we cry our grief will reduce. Till we avenge his death we should not shed a single tear! Get up! "Let us arise from down beneath." "Answer ready, army to attack. Memories of you bounce back." "Let us arise from down beneath." "For you, my dear friend." "Eight directions on red alert. Heart's furnace ablaze, overt." "In our eyes, his face flashes. Let the world burn down to ashes." "Day to search the seed of dissent. "Date to ferret the foe 100 percent." "In the whole world, friend.. That one word is so wonderful." "Dear friend in the whole world.." "Dear friend in the whole world.." "Dear friend in the whole world.." "To avenge, settle scores.. Anguish makes the blood roar." "For the storm to abate within, let the hunt begin." "Childhood friendship.." "So precious to slay in a web of deceit is atrocious." "Today will be tribute to his obituary." - Did you eat? "Let the world tremble." "Friend forever.." Here, keep the change. "Friend forever.." "Friend forever.." Hey, Pazhani! Look at his parents. Aren't they lovely together? Where are your parents? They are no more. - We are there for you. Let's keep a name for him first. - Yes. - Come on. - Let's go. Pazhani, Aarumugam, Senthil.. You're Saravanan from today. He's our friend for life. "Fate's hands in a net of treachery." "Friend's life ended in trickery." "Skulk of foxes holed up happily" "after killing a cheetah heartily." "Blood bath, a war footing offering." "End of the ritual is nearing." "Let the disquiet conscience submerge in violence." "Even a dip in the sea" "refuse to douse the rage in the heart." He is showing off to me. See. "The rising fire in the heart" "turns the world into a singed shore." "The red soil, blood saturated" "will be another battle ground." "A chess game dawns with humans as pawns." "Let's take it as a deal to make the beasts kneel." "Eight directions on red alert." "Heart's furnace ablaze, overt. In our eyes, his face flashes." "Day to search the seed of dissent. "Date to ferret the foe 100 percent." "Unshed tears salute a friend." "To avenge, settle scores. Anguish makes the blood roar." "For the storm to abate within, let the hunt begin." "Childhood friendship.." "So precious to kill in a web of deceit, heinous." "Today will be a tribute to his obituary" "let the world tremble." I really don't know how to console you. No one can compensate the death of a friend. It will be difficult for you. Our elders say God takes away the ones He loves the most. I feel terrible. Don't cry, Saravana. He'll always be with you. Saravana! Why did you come here? As if only you can console him! Only after you entered his life, we have been plagued with problems. I feel disgusted to even look at your face. Go, otherwise, I'll kill you right here. Leave. The cops are looking for us. Let's leave this place. Greetings, sir. Greetings! Who are these men? - Pickpocket. - What? Pickpocket. - Bike thief. Are you running a brothel? Yes, but I'm paying him my dues correctly, sir. Who are you? Won't you tell him, sir? How many times should I repeat? You idiot! You think, you can get away after degrading a policeman? Rascal, get lost. Listen. - Sir. - Ensure every single thug is behind bars. Don't spare anyone. - Come on. Fast. Fast. Go in. You've no idea what the police can do! Are you trying to get me into trouble? I know, how to handle you. Sir! They say cops catch a thief by throwing a net. Why didn't you use that net on me? I'll smash your face. His bike was found at the crime spot. Greetings! Sir is taking his weapon out! Where is the rest of your gang? - Gang? All those who drink with me in the bar are part of my gang. If you want to take their head count you must shut down the Government wine shop. What is he blabbering? - Who took your bike? Who took my bike? Our person. He is right, I gave my bike to one of the boys. But I don't know them. Why did you give your bike to a random stranger? They are my bar friends, sir. They were pushing the bar one day. They asked me to lend a hand. I refused to help. 'I am in trouble now.' I asked them permission to push the bar closer to home. They nodded in approval. I managed to push the bar. Only then I realized there were four boys inside the bar I pushed. Couldn't you get a weirder wacko than this? Take him out of my sight! - Okay, Sir. Do you want some tips? - I will teach you a lesson. You are the talk of the town. Your photos are put up all over the city. Read the news. See for yourself. This must be that Inspector's strategy. To finish us in an encounter. What are you saying? Yes. To plan for an encounter first, they'll enact a drama as if one of them was killed. That's how, they killed our Pazhani. They'll target each one of us now. That inspector must have killed Pazhani. Suddenly in the dark, there was just the sound of a swish of a knife. I didn't see his face. He is taking revenge on us because we assaulted him. Stop the car. Take reverse. Look at this poster. They are big thieves. They are the ones who'd come to our house and created trouble. Start the car. Move. Don't create a scene. Get lost! All are fighting for water. - Hello. How are you? I am fine. - How is your family? Everyone's doing fine. A guy in your area has borrowed money from me and is being elusive! Tell us who he is and we will do the needful! Move from here. - He knows my power, but still, isn't repaying. What a pandemonium! They always keep fighting for water! Forever being a nuisance, wasted wastrel! Kill him. Kill him. Let's escape, else, we will be booked in a case. Do your work. - Okay, go. Okay, wait. I will come. They cut my ears off. Get into the car. Hello? - Inspector? Yes. Who are you? Kill him. What did we do? All we did was steal. You could've put us behind bars. Why did you kill our friend? Did I kill your friend? Are you out of your mind? Why will I kill only one of you? I've been hunting for all four of you as a gang. You killed a cop mercilessly. You'll be killed in an encounter. What are you waiting for? Kill him just like Pazhani was killed. Slit his throat! I want his family to mourn his death just the way we did for our dear friend. Go ahead, kill him. Kill him! Come on! Come on! Why will I kill you? Am I a scumbag like you to kill you with a sickle? I'm a police man. - Saravana, let him go. I have a gun and I can easily shoot all of you. He's not the killer. Let's run. Come. Come on! Why did you stop me from killing him? I would've killed him. Were you scared of getting caught for killing a police man? Don't be stupid. We are handling this stupidly by considering ourselves to be smart. If we continue to be impulsive, they will kill us! None of us would remain alive. How will we avenge our friend's death then? He is right. Why use a sickle when he has a gun? I remember that guy's hand very well. He was a left hander. That inspector is a right-hander. He didn't kill Pazhani for sure. We are inviting trouble and burying ourselves in it. Tell me. - Saravana.. Come to Poonga Arya Bhavan tomorrow morning. Come on. Tell me. - Should you speak to me in anger? Can't you talk to me with a smile? I'm worried about you. I want you to be with me always. I want to tell my father about us. I don't have the time to talk with you. The image of Pazhani's death still flashes before my eyes. I can't think of any happy occasion when that image comes to my mind. Please don't disturb me for few days. Will you always only think of your friend? Don't you have a life of your own? I'll change your life. I'll tell my father to arrange for some business for you. Did you call me for this? - Saravana! Father.. Yes, dear. - I need to talk to you. Today also, haven't you prepared the food properly? Yeah! Pick on me! Ask your daughter what she wants. What is it, dear? - I'm in love, father. What did you just say? Are you in love? I've lost my dignity, pride, prestige! Did you hear that? As soon as she completed her 12th grade, I asked you to marry her off. This is what you get by sending her to college. How will I face my brothers? My daughter is telling something important and you're lamenting loudly without even letting me listen to it. Go inside. Who is he? The one whom our men hit for speaking to me in the temple. He's actually a good man. Since the time you were a child I've given you all that you've asked for. Be it a particular dress, cycle, school bike, even car! I even built this house as per your wish. I'll even buy you a dog. But if you thought of feeding it from my plate I'll kill you! Being an only child, I pampered you. I sent you to college and you dared to fall in love! Looks like you want to get married. I'll find a groom for you. You had better marry the guy I choose for you. You are forbidden from going to college or any other darn place. Bala, my daughter shouldn't step out anywhere. Okay, sir. - Take good care of her. Okay, sir. - Finish those boys first. Okay. Tell me. - Saravana, where are you? What's the matter? He can never be reformed! What? - We're getting married. Change into this dress. - Why are you so impulsive? This will only end in disaster. How can you be so flippant about getting married? Go home now. No, Saravana. I'm scared. I've told my father about us. He's looking for a groom for me. I can't live with anyone else. All parents tend to be strict when they know, their child is in love. They would've built many hopes and dreams on you. You are their only child. They'd like to get you married with a lot of grandeur. You've suddenly given them such a shocking news! Of course, they'll be seething with anger. I love you as much as you love me. I will not abandon you for sure. Be a little patient. We can talk it over in a calm manner. I'll marry only you irrespective of whenever it is. Don't worry. Just leave. No, I won't go. Tie the wedding chain around my neck and then, go wherever you want to. Even if I die tomorrow, it will be as Mrs. Saravanan. Don't be crazy! Is this the age to die? Saravana, please change your dress. I can't go home now. - Saravana! Go fast. Drive faster. An auto rickshaw is following us. Are we armed? - Yes. Ask our boys to come to our brick kiln. Why are you following my car? Had I known, it was you I'd have stopped the car right there. Where is your friend who keeps prancing like a catfish? You! You killed my friend! Come, face me. Why did you kill him? Speak up! Sir! Sir! Sir! Forgive us, we didn't know, what we were doing! If you want, kill me, but spare my friend. Oh, God! I'll hack you to pieces. I don't belong to a family of back stabbers. I fight my opponent face to face! How dare anyone come to my place and cheat me! Because I kept my word, you walked away alive the other day. Even now, nothing stops me from killing all of you. I returned the sacred statue to the temple as if I found it. In their joy of getting the idol of their Goddess back the whole village made me preside over the temple festival. It's because of that gratitude, I'm letting you go now. You came to attack me just because you thought, I killed your friend. Now, I like you guys even more! Why would I kill him? You guys were about to lose your lives because of your impulsiveness. Let go of him. Come here. How could you suspect me? What's your problem? Do you need my help? Forgive me, sir. You're like brothers to me. If you have any problem you can approach me anytime. Let's go. Start the car. Go to the nearest hospital. Saravana! Saravana! Why did you come here? Why are you tormenting me like this? What's my mistake? I was avoiding you in the beginning. If you hadn't followed me I'd have happily married the groom of my parents' choice. You made me fall in love with you and now, why are you torturing me? Saravana, leave all this behind. Let's go somewhere and start a new life. Please, Saravana. - Look.. I have no idea what my future will be. I'm not even sure if I'll live. Our only goal now, is to kill the man who killed Pazhani. We're fighting our enemies totally in the dark. If I die in this struggle you get married to a suitable boy. If I'm alive, I'll definitely marry only you. Leave now. Marry someone else? Then, why did you fall in love with me? Why did you love me? Why did you love me? Don't desert me, Saravana. I can't live without you. I'll die. - Saravana! Let's go. I have to go now. You leave. I won't go. Don't leave me. I'm telling you to leave. - I won't.. Don't go. Marry me now. As much as I am important to you my friends are equally important to me. I'll move on with my life only after I kill Pazhani's killer. If you stop me.. - Saravana! - Get lost! No, Saravana. Please, Saravana. Don't leave me. I can't live without you. What will I do? Don't abandon me. Please, Saravana. Forgive me if I've spoken out of turn. Are you deaf or what? Saravana, you're going to see me dead! Here. This is Rs.5,00,000. Take it. I'd saved up this money for you. Take that girl to some far off place and stay happily. That's enough for us. Despite her affluent upbringing, she insists, she'll only marry you. She's the right one for you. I never thought, her love for you was this intense. What a girl! Despite knowing our intentions, she is willing to marry you. Take her away and get married. Go. We'll take care of Pazhani's killer. I am as vexed as you are! My heart will be appeased only when I hack that chap to pieces. I'm still unable to take in his death. Is this the time for me to live with her happily? I can get back my life anytime I want. I'll never ever get friends like you. Even if I had a family of my own I'd have never been so happy. I'm so happy with you guys. Where will I go without you? Saravana! Saravana! He's the lefty who had killed our Pazhani! He had set up his goons to kill Pazhani. We have to finish him. We must execute it cleverly. You abduct Rajendran while I distract his men. Senthil! Hey! Senthil! What happened to you? Hey! Senthil.. Hey! Senthil.. Hey! Hey! Hey, Senthil. Tell me how this happened. Hey, Senthil.. Hello? - I'm Rajendran speaking. The thieves you are looking for are here, killing each other. Which area? - Narimedu. Senthil, what happened? Tell us, please. Hey! Senthil.. Hey! Senthil.. We've made a blunder. Hey! Senthil. Hey! Senthil.. Pazhani was killed by.. Why do you get jealous if I love him? What's it with you? You threatened me with a knife. You are a novice when compared to me. I was born with a knife in my hand! You told him not to trust a girl from Madurai. Girls from Madurai will forsake their lives for love. They can also take the life of the one who interferes! Even my parents haven't spoken to me the way you've degraded me. If you don't believe in love go and kill yourself! Why do you brainwash the one who is in love? He's so obsessive about his friends! You stopped him from marrying me. I'd sent my men to kill you the other day. But poor Pazhani became the victim. I thought, I'd forgive you. But you keep bouncing back like the malefic effects of Saturn! Goddess Meenakshi protects Madurai. This Meenakshi here, is there to protect Saravanan! Who are you to interfere? You orphan! I'll kill whoever comes in between my love and me. You lefty! At least, now, do your job properly. What are you saying, Senthil? I am scared, I'll die. - Oh, no! Don't say that, Senthil. - I feel, someone is dragging me. Saravana! - Get up. - Aarumugam.. Save me. Hey! Senthil.. - Saravana! Don't leave me. Hey! Senthil. Hey! Senthil! Senthil! Senthil! Meenakshi! Buddy.. Forgive me. I killed her. Buddy, police! Excuse me, your face looks familiar to me. Do you remember me? I've seen him somewhere. I'm just not able to recollect. I want to live with you.
