The Earth is now populated by 3 billion people... In less than 40 years there will be twice as many people. The number of cars grows three times as fast... and five times as fast as the streets necessary to carry them. Julian Huxley says that stress is evident... in any city of over 1 million people. If all the vehicles in the U.S. were lined up... the line would be as long as all the streets in the USA put together. In Latin America, over 1 million people die each year... due to hunger and malnutrition. In 1954, the USA used up... 50% of the world's raw materials. By 1980 they'll be using 83% of them. Stress, a heart disease... a mental aberration... ulcers, etc, is due to... urban ennui, strenuous work and the lifestyle in large cities. Noises and worries are also stress factors for the heart. Do you want one? Leave him alone. Let him sleep if he wants to. I won't wake him up, I just want the Kleenex. Sit down. Just watch him waking up. Hold on tight. What's wrong with you? Can't I sleep? Driving the dead is no fun. Will you be like this the entire trip long? Nights are made for sleeping, days for being awake, even if you disagree. I went to sleep early last night. Yes, as usual. I was in bed at 12-12:30. - I was reading a novel. - Yeah, who with? Alone. Novels are meant to be read by yourself. What a pair! Why don't you let me sleep a while? Come on, Antonio! Don't be a bore. Wake up! Reading last night! He probably doesn't believe it himself. What about you? Why not? Not me. If you tell me what the novel is about, I'll repent. All right. In the novel, women turned into men. Men turned into women. And all the thalidomide kids were sent away to war. All because of, naturally, excess population. Which was mostly made up of... old men like this one. And what else? Well, they sent the kids away to war... and they killed each other. So the population couldn't grow. Don't you think it's a wonderful solution to the problem of wars? If only you had the same imagination for your job. Go on. What happened next? That's where I left off. I had a terrible headache. I don't know what's wrong with me... I've been sleeping badly for several nights. All those worries, I suppose. Or a bad conscience. Speaking of conscience, read this. Read it and you'll see how the world is doing. - 1968 Development Plan. - Not that. Rehearsal Against Mediterranean Fly Next week, on the island of Capri... there will be a rehearsal of a plan against the Mediterranean fruit fly, which has become a dangerous plague, using sterilized males. I liked that part about sterilized males. Just for you, Antonio! The technique consists of freeing flies that have been subjected to... atomic radiations that render them sterile. The carefully controlled radiations destroy the reproductive capacity... in males in a manner that allows them to destroy the eggs laid by the females... instead of fertilizing them. At last, a method has been found that allows for the atomic sterilization... of insects at a low cost. See what I mean? At a low cost. A few radiations and you're cooked for life. That would be handy for a few people. - Are you referring me? - No, not you. For you... not even with radiations. With a little bit of luck, I can just see you at 70 with a walking cane and... worried about the future, which, between you and I, looks pretty uncertain. My future? My future is easy to foretell. As long as we work together, I see no reason to worry. My future is certain. No, I'm not afraid of that. I'm just afraid of losing what took us so much effort. I'd be happy to go on living as we are now. What about you? What a couple! When you get tedious, you go all the way. Things are OK the way they are, right? So just let it roll. What I don't get is how you can repeat the same crap every day. You can't call such important things "crap". All right. I promise not to say anything intelligent. Well, maybe a couple of things. You were out partying. I can just see it in your face. And you probably went to bed at sunrise. Again. No! I'm not interested in population growth. Your husband's got a one-track mind today. - Do you know the city of the future? - No, I don't. - New York? - Calcutta! More than 600,000 people live, eat and die on the streets of Calcutta. No roof over their heads. - Maybe due to the good weather. - Kids eat along with the dogs. - The whole city smells of death. - That's horrible. Is it true? Must be true if he says so. So many horrible things in this world. Fernando, Thursday is our daughter's birthday. Already? If you had a child, you wouldn't be so cynical. Your concept of life would be different. Sure. And if I had a bigger house, a better car... and a few million in the bank, my life would change too. - You've said nothing new. - There are other things. Work, a family, children. And the wife, with a broken leg and locked up in the house. A broken hoof, Teresa. A hoof is a very different thing. The hoof is something else. It is a strange member some mammals have to... walk, to step, and to... how should I know? To swim, for example. - Stop for a moment. - What's wrong? Nothing, i need to get off the car. - Now? - Yes, now! Wait until the next town. I can't. Make it fast. - Want one? - No, thanks. I'll stretch my legs as long as we're at it. Very funny, ha, ha. I bet he went to get some flowers. - Come with me, come on. - Where are you taking me? Don't let him see us. Teresa? Teresa! - Didn't I tell you about the flowers? - Look what I've brought you, Teresa! I'm off, this a boring game. - And Teresa? - How should I know? Look at these flowers! Where are you? Warm... warm... I just wanted to give you a surprise. Look. They're very pretty. Don't ever do this again. All right... Have you thought about what I said? How much will you pay me? Friendship is one thing, but business is business, you know. I'm serious. I need you there. There's a lot of money at stake. I have to think it over. A whole winter locked up... Sometimes... money isn't enough. What do you think, Teresa? You won't force him to be there a whole year? That's none of your business. I can't go, and if it's not me, who better than Antonio? In short, how much will you pay me? We'll reach an agreement. If everything goes according to plan... it won't be a waste of your time, I can guarantee that. Do you still have a headache? A bit. Your husband always hits the nail on the head. Way to go. A whole year in the middle of the desert. I need a definite answer by next week. Listen, what's that? Once I had to put out a fire in a pine forest. I spent half a year without hair. I looked like a Martian. Women screamed in fright when they saw me. Please, hurry up! Help me! Help me, please! Pull! Pull! - Fernando! Fernando! - Move away! Move away! Get that woman in the car, fast! Take the woman to the car! Come on! Can't you hear me? Or are you good for nothing? Be careful! Which is the nearest town? Come on, answer! - It's nearby, I'll go with the motorcycle - Fine. You stay here and make sure nobody touches anything, I'll alert the police. Move over, I'll drive. - You go on ahead, I'll follow. - Yes, sir. - How is she? - I don't think she's aware of anything. It's best to move her as little as possible in these cases. She might have a broken bone. Stop for a moment, Fernando! - Will you stop moving? - Just stop! - Stop! - I'm not stopping until we get to the town! The sooner we get there, the better. Calm down. Calm down. - Bbb-ag... - She wants her bag. Antonio, can you get it? Here you are. - Can't get through here. - Leave the car here, Fernando. It can't be very far. We can't carry her, try to get through. We can't. Do you want me to split the car in two? Hang on, I'll check. Steer to the right. Full steer! You're clean! Straight ahead! - Have you called the doctor? - Yes, sir. Easy, Teresa, calm down. It's no big deal. What's wrong? Are you ill? Sit down. At about 11.30 PM... on September 28... 1967... in this precinct, and before the undersigned... comes a person who claims to be Fernando Serra Pardo... born in Bilbao. Born on January 10, 1932. Industry professional. Who lives in Madrid, 12 Maria de Molina Street. Married? Yes, married. Just a few formalities. You saw the car burning... isn't that so? When we got there, there was very little we could do. I tried to put out the fire with the extinguisher. He declares that when he arrived at the accident site... the car with Madrid license plate 226-288... was overturned and burning... at the 23 KM mark on the 312 county road. And that faced with nothing else to do... he did what he could to save the life of the passengers... of the aforementioned vehicle, by helping the victims and transporting the wounded woman... who's yet to be identified... to the nearest town, where the present declaration is being written. What's up? Will you just leave me by myself? - Teresa's not well. - Leave her be. You have to declare. I'm coming. What are you up to? What's with the shoe? Let's go, please. Let's go. - How are you feeling? - I'll know once we get out of here. Hasn't changed a bit. It's strange that no one is coming out. Instead of making so much noise, why don't you get out of the car? Enough, Ok? It's tedious. Juan! - Hi, Juan. How are you? - Fine, and you, sir? - Where are my brothers? - They left this morning, they didn't have time to tell you. Your husband's very affectionate lately. Sometimes he's like that. When a husband's affectionate, something's going on. Do you think it's strange that he still loves me? No, it's not that. Have you noticed he's spying on us? And you don't know where they've gone? No, sir. They left at dawn. - What's wrong? - Pablo isn't here. - Good day, Miss Teresa. - When's he coming back? Dona Matilde knows, I don't. - Dona Matilde was expecting you later. - Later? I don't understand. - If you don't need me... - Matilde! My girl! What happened to you? - Well... nothing, just a paint smudge. - Hi, aunt. Do you want one of Beatriz' blouses? Thanks, later. You remember Antonio? - Pleased to meet you, Madam. - Why didn't Pablo and Beatriz stay? I'll explain. Let's go inside. How was the trip? - No so good. - You must be tired, right? - Not much. - Will you be eating here? - I'm not sure. - Why? Listen, who's Antonio? I don't remember him. But, Aunt Matilde, he's been here many times. You must remember. He was the best man at our wedding. Nobody told me about the wedding. I was the last person to know, as usual. Matilde! Of course we told you! We let all our loved ones know. Don't you remember? - You were ill. - Nobody told me anything. I thought we wouldn't make it. Bad luck, eh? I just want to get into the swimming pool and forget about everything. - Do I have to play the guest now? - Of course not, we'll be leaving soon. Just enough time not to be rude. - What will you have, Antonio? - Anything. Bring some ice, aunt. Wait, Fernando. Let her rest a bit. - I'm not getting any younger. - Do your legs still hurt? I don't think it's rheumatism. Can I use the pool, madam? Of course you can. Be my guest. - I'll get my swimming trunks, then. - Anybody else wants to? Don't you want to go for a swim, Teresa? - Is that enough? - Yes, thank you. You could have brought the little girl here, it would do her wonders. Yes, but you know her grandmother. She insisted so much... - It's blood. - I've told you that it's paint. - Is Lucero in? - You don't want to ride now. That's exactly what I want to do! Here. In case you want to swim later. Not a bad time to start drinking. Great! Doesn't even work. I'll go for a swim. By the way... - Where can I change? - Anywhere. - Aunt, will you show him? - Sure. Come this way. Teresa, wait. I want to talk to you. - You can change in Pablito's room. - There's no need. I can change in the car or by the pool. Forget it. Pablito must be looking for critters. It's no problem. Come this way. - You can leave your clothes here. - Thank you. Here you are. Beatriz almost never wears it. - Why don't you stay for dinner? - Impossible. Some other time. I think it'll suit you. You're much thinner! I'd like to rest a bit. I'm leaving. We'll talk later, Matilde. I'll help you with the sandwiches. Don't worry. Juan will take care of that. Why don't you rest a while? I'm not tired. The accident shook you, didn't it? What do you think? What happened was not my fault. You look strange. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing's wrong, least of all with you. Fernando, hand me the blouse, will you? Fernando, please! Fernando! You've been very nervous lately. - Nervous? - Yes, nervous. Don't you have anything to say? What do you want me to say? I'd like to be alone with you. Doesn't look that way. Why did you invite Antonio? Now give me the blouse, please. - Thank you. - That's not an answer! Have I done something that bothered you? If you don't love me anymore, I'd like you to tell me. Of course I love you. Have you forgotten that I'm your wife? Fernando, what's with you these days? Nothing. Why did you pull away? I'm not pulling away. Don't you pull away from me when I'm kissing you! Forgive me, it wasn't my intention. I love you. I know it's my fault. I don't pay attention to you, do I? It's not that. I'm just this way because... I don't know, because of the accident. - No, not now. - Fine, do what you want! Here we go again. Why don't you have a cold shower? Maybe you'll calm down! The horse is ready, miss. Thank you, Jorge. My poor little Lucero! You're a handsome one. How are you? Thank you. Come on, Lucero. Easy does it, easy does it. What are you doing here? Haven't they taught you to knock before entering? - What's that? - They're mine. Help me, uncle, or they'll escape. Where did you get all these bugs? I catch some, others are sent by mail. It's disgusting! - What do you want now? - Would you like to see the motorcycle? - Which motorcycle? - Dad's. Your dad's still got one? It's new, but don't tell mom. She doesn't know. He's got it hidden. Your father's at it again. What do you mean? Let's go see that bike. How long has he had it? They brought it a couple of days ago. I discovered it. Come. It's here Come, uncle. Help me. Where are you taking me? Well, well. What do you think? Mother won?t let him ride motorcycles. He promised he wouldn't. Is it true he almost died in an accident? But when mom's away, he practices... He says you were even better than him. Is that true? Yesterday he filled it up. And the helmet is brand new! - Let me have those. - Here you are. Now you'll see who your uncle is! Wait, uncle! Wait for me! Uncle! Uncle, wait for me! Wait for me! Lucero, this way... Easy, like this. What is it? How did you like that? Did you see me? Are you nuts? Do you want to get killed? I'm still in good shape. Wait and see! Stop right now! You'll get hurt! Fernando! Get away with that bike! What is it that you want? Go away! You're crazy! You're scaring the horse! Go away! What's wrong with you? Go away! The horse will throw me off! Go away! Why are you doing this? You moron! Fernando! Are you hurt? - Let me see. - It's nothing. - No big deal. - What are you going to do? - No, Fernando, please don't. - Let me go! - Come on, let me go! - Don't do it, please... - Please, don't do it! - Leave me alone! All right, suit yourself! You're crazy! Totally nuts! Have you seen that, huh? How about that jump? - Does it hurt? - No. Follow me, try and catch me. He could have killed himself. My goodness! Every time I remember his brother... - Two days in a coma. - Aunt, it's just a slight wound. Give me the peroxide, please. It's right over there. Thank you. It's your fault! He drives me crazy. And his parents don't bat an eyelash. He's impossible! - Leave him alone. - Don't meddle with the kid. It's nobody's fault, these things happen. - Does it hurt? - Just a bit. Did you see that jump? Not even your father could do it better. It was great, right, aunt? You should get a tetanus shot. Do you remember poor old Mateo? Stiff as a board, he couldn't move. - An awful death. - If you just saw what we saw! - Fernando, please... - What was it? - No, nothing. - But what was it? - What happened, Teresa? - Nothing, aunt, just an accident. A guy burning like a torch. Like those monks who light themselves up with gasoline. Haven't you seen them on TV? They end up as charcoal mummies. Really? That's awful. Hey, what's going on? What are you doing on your knees? She's healing me. A quite painful wound. - That hurt! - Sorry. It's finished. You gonna leave me like this? Sorry, honey, but I don't know how to apply bandages. I'll get dressed. I'll do it, my child. Well, well... tough luck. Looks like the holiday's over. No way! We've got to see that land first. And decide on your future. You'll spend the most boring winter in your lifetime, all for your good. - I'm off. - Where are you going? I can't stand seeing you suffer. I'm very sensitive. Hurry up, aunt. We're leaving. - Aunt! - What is it, Pablito? This is for you. Do you like it? - It's nice. - It's a beetle. For good luck. Thank you. You've wrecked the motorcycle, uncle. It doesn't look the same. When my father sees it... Beat it, kid! Leave me alone! Go help Juan. Move it! I've finished. Get some rest, it'll do you good. Do you want me to draw the curtains? Ok, aunt, do as you please. ...moving my feet not knowing where I step... like a sleepwalker... Why don't you tell me precisely what you want? Don?t you realize we can't keep going on like this? I'm not an object! You treat me as if I were a cat or a dog. You kick them, then you pet them and wait till they come lick your hand. I'm sorry, but I'm not like that. You've got a decision to make. - Teresa, excuse me... - You could have knocked! - You scared me! - Excuse me, it's just... it hurts a lot right now. What were you doing? Well... to tell the truth, I was trying on some of Beatriz's clothes. Do you like it? Do you like it? - It's not bad. - It's a bit large. Some craze with other people's clothes! Don't you think it?s disgusting? No, I don?t! Hurry up, we're leaving. Antonio darling, do you mind watching the landscape for a while? If I must... Throw that bug away, Teresa. I never want to see it again. Why? It's a present from Pablito. To kill a bug in such a way... What would you say if someone pierced your chest with a pin? Huh, I'm not a bug. I said throw it away! I'm not a bug, I?m not a bug... My dear husband! You're insufferable! Can we know why? Well, man, just what we needed. Don't start arguing, please. There's nothing worse than being in the middle of a quarreling couple. - Give me that. - And who said we're quarreling? Come on, give me that purse. Right. May I throw it away? - That settles it. - End of the bug! The world's population will double in the next 40 years. Today it is around 3 billion. Statistics say that in 2600, every man will only have 9 square feet of ground. We'll have to die standing up. I've already reserved my 9 square feet. In "El Vate". Nobody can touch it! The only solution is war. Let a few million disappear, nobody'll notice. As long as it doesn't touch us, of course. In the seventh century, somewhere in Ireland... the population grew too much and there wasn't enough food. The Kings of Erie met with the Religious Chiefs. The Kings proposed to increase the land production... but the Religious Chiefs proposed a long-term fasting... which would provoke a plague among the lower class. They did as the Religious Chiefs said. The plague killed half the population... including the Kings and the Religious Chiefs. Where did you get that from? I read it on Esquire. I haven't made it up, rest assured. The world is a very wrong place. Very, very wrong. A war would even be more awful. You know what I say? When they drop the H-bomb... the ground will become dry, parched. Dead. Just like this. This music makes the place look better. I think scuba fishing is disgusting. Specially hanging the fish around you. They're so slimy... - You women can't stand three things. - Antonio, not again? - Right, but I bet you don't know. - Ok, do as you please... Milk, bird feathers and fish. They're all related, don't you think? I can't see the relation. Milk detoxifies. Bird feathers are used for mattresses... and fish have phosphorus. Is that clear now? Antonio! Will you ever be serious? Ah, you mean me? I'm not like your husband. He takes everything too seriously. He'll have a heart attack any day. You'll get that heart attack after a year locked into that place. But don't worry. We'll come to your burial. Do you know what my tombstone will say? "Here rests in peace Don Antonio Linares... " "resident of San Roque, born in 1933... " - "died on 2933." - What an idiot! Don't go any further. We won't be able to get out. I told you so! You should always follow your wife's advice. Women are always right. Do you want me to push? Come on, get off the car, will you? If you had listened to me, this wouldn't have happened. - Are you ready? - Whenever you say. Step on it, Fernando! More! Fernando, I'm not pushing anymore. You don't expect me to spend the whole day pushing! Give me my purse. And open the hatch, I'll change my clothes. Do as you please. Why don't we just leave it for later? No, I'd rather do it by myself. Don't worry. No, man, I'll help you. I said it's not necessary. What about the housing project? Isn't that what we came here for? - Later. After lunch. - As you please. Your call. Antonio! Who might have lost this glove? Isn't it yours? I'm not that obsessive. It must be your husband's. Speaking of your husband... How long has he been spying on you? For about a week, more or less. A week? Huh, huh... Well, there must be a reason. - Really? You think he has motives? - Oh, forget my absurd idea. Absurd, completely absurd. He's known you for so many years... he should know you only fancy those fat money chasers. - Huh, Teresa, Teresa, 14 more pounds... - Just like Ana. Isn't that true? How much are you paying Ana? Teresa, please. I'm a sexy guy. You are. And how much would you pay for me? Well, it depends. Women... get paid according to their merits. Get on the catwalk! Get on the catwalk! Get walking! Come on, walk! Stop! Turn round. Now come back with rhythm. Those arms! Those arms, that rhythm! - Can you sing? - Yes. Enough! Enough! And you can dance? Perfect. You?ve passed the practical test. Now let's see some theory. And now the essential questions. - Do you speak Spanish? - Yes. - Are you married? - Yes... - Any children? - Yes! - Thrifty? - Yes. - Home loving and faithful wife? - Oh, yes! And now the most important question... Do you hold anything against rhinoceros? Oh, no! Not at all! Great, Teresa! You're as good as cash, a blank check. - The opinion of an expert. - A blank check! Sign it! Antonio! Yours at last! Watch it, Teresa. You know you're very attractive. The only thing I know... is that he expects us to behave right the way we are. I can play along, if you wish. But... you'll have to reward me. Now, let?s go! Fernando! You don't know what this guy says about you. What does this fool say? He says you are one of the greatest bores in the whole world. - Are you hungry? - Yes, let's have something. - Want some? - Yes, I'll have a cheese sandwich. Here. So I'm boring, huh? What about you? Man, you're not precisely fun. Too much to worry about. Money, wife, a child, a job you enjoy. The result is you're afraid of losing it all. That's why you are a bore. In my case, I have nothing. What do I have to lose? You might even lose your shirt one of these days. You'll end up lonely as a rat. Some old age awaits you! How can you think of old age? Look at Teresa... full of life! And you think of old age! Second square... Take off that stocking. It's disgusting. Why? I said take it off! - Don't you like me like this? - Take it off, please. As you please. - Why don't we leave? - Right now? Yes. Right now. Please. Why? Nothing is rushing us. - Fernando, let's go now. Please. - No, not now! All right, all right, all right! More, more, don't be a miser! Aren't we going to make a toast? - A toast for the three of us... - Let's toast for our daughter. Have you forgotten we have a daughter? I make a toast to the health of my daughter and this guy's daughter. May she be just like her mother... except for her husband. You are so very funny... What a pair of bores! Come on, Fernando. Let's go take a dip. Later. Antonio. Cheer up! Try and catch me! Take a dip! Let's race! Just like this! Crawling! Like me! Crawling! Show you're still young! You jumped higher than me at school! All right, let's do it! But I'm handicapped! - Why? That's nothing! - Let's start! - Ok! - Wait a moment! What's the prize? A prize! I?ve got a prize right here! Let's go! This is the finishing line. - Get ready! - Ready! Come on, Teresa! Are you ready? One, two, three... Go! They're on the run! Come on Fernando, you'll win! Fernando! You're first! Fernando heads the pack! But Antonio is approaching fast! Antonio in the lead! Come on, Antonio! Come on, Antonio! Antonio in first place! Come on, come on! Oh my God, that's cheating! Come on! Come on, Fernando! Antonio! Hurry! Antonio! Come on! No cheating! No cheating! Now Antonio is first! No! - Now you'll see! - Stop! Stop right now! Here's your prize! You deserve it! Didn't I tell you to throw it away? You won't get away with it! You... will... learn... to... obey... me. This is what happens to misbehaved girls... - like you. - Leave me alone, you beast! Come here! Jump right beside me! Asshole! You'll pay for this! I swear you will pay for this! - Teresa! Come here! - Leave me alone! Moron! - I've said come here! - I don't feel like it! Women! When are we going to see that land? Isn't that we came here for? No, not now. Almost a year without doing any exercise. You're not tired? I'm not. I'll try and catch some fish. - Coming? - No, I'm not. - Come on, Fernando, cheer up! - Hmm. Come on, hurry up! Let me help you. Help me. Fernando! Look! Look what Antonio got! Poor little thing! All naked! You'll catch a cold. Go get some clothes. Help me gather all the stuff. We're leaving. How come we're leaving? Business is business. Shouldn't we go see the housing project? We'll come some other day. Next week. Just the two of us. - I'm coming too. - We'll see about that. Subtitles: supersoft and scalisto for the KG tracker
