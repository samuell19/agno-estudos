BEAUTY AND THE BEAST FOR ANNE Isn't he cute? His name's J?nne. All the girls are crazy about him. Really? That's hard to tell from this photo. He's so handsome. He works as a model. But he's only doing it for fun. - Is it someone from school? - Yes. He's taking his HPE. He wants to be a photographer. He's got a studio in town. - What? A studio? - Yes. - It's called Star Studio. - Star Studio? - Yes. It's an atelier. - Really? All right, then. - We bring Christmas presents. - Hello, mum. - What a beautiful tree. - Yes. We got it yesterday. How are you doing? I brought some Christmas roses. Thank you. - Where are all the others? - They're at home. I'm the only one they kept here. They look so nice. I chose them carefully. Aren't you going to take off your jacket? I've been here for 87 days, so my three month anniversary is coming up. We should celebrate. Is he kicking a lot? Mostly on the right. - Did you get what I asked for? - Almost everything. And I bought something nice for Mette. You can take it now. It's in the white plastic bag. - Can you feel it? Try over here. - Yes. - You can have it now. - Now? Yes. What is it? Is it a paint roller? Yes. Mette can help painting the nursery. - That's a really good idea. - And we'll have something to do. - That was a good present. - Just what I wanted. Lars, how nice of you to come and visit me. - And you brought a present. - That's very sweet of you. - Shall I open it? - Yes. - Don't open it, until you get home. - What is it? Look at these lovely chocolates. That's really sweet of you. I have a present for you, too. You can open it now. What is it? It's very nice. That's a very good present. Thank you. I almost can't carry all my presents. You be careful now. Let's light the candles on our tree, since I've put up the ornaments. Do you know what time it is? It's twenty to twelve. So what? It's still Christmas Eve. - You forgot to put a star on top. - That doesn't matter. - We'll put it up tomorrow. - The star's the most important bit. Turn on the one in the oriel window. You've taken out all the ornaments. Yes. Turn around. And let me see you from the front. And show me your profile. Wide hips and a bit of a belly. That's how a man's supposed to look. Oh, sure. I like your sides as well. Nice and flabby. It's an athlete's fold. I wonder what you'd look like, if we could remove all the brown freckles. - You've got a cute mouth. - And you have it, too. - But I didn't get your nose. - It's a very fine nose, though. Let me see. There's some kind of hidden beauty about you. Yes. That's the stuff. I wonder what would happen, if someone was to kiss you on the snout. I wonder what you would turn into. - Give it a try. - No. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. - I don't think so. - Well. Say uncle. - Say it out loud. - Uncle! Uncle! - Do you think, I'm a gambler? - Yeah, right. Let's sing a Christmas carol. No... I don't know what it is, but there's something about you. What's so funny? I'm sorry to say... you look like a toad. - I look like what? - A toad. Let's call a truce. I'll never say you look like a toad again. All right. It's a truce. - Don't you believe me? - You never know. Let's sing that Christmas carol. What's that? - Is it the present from Lars? - Yes. - What is it? - A silver heart. That's very sweet of him. What is it? Nothing. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. Merry Christmas. - Yes. Merry Christmas. - My name's J?rgen. - People call him J?nne. If my name's J?rgen Kj?r Knudsen, what's yours, then? What my name is? - But that is your name. - That's what I said. If my name's J?rgen Kj?r Knudsen, what's yours, then? J?rgen... Huitfeldt. Oh, J?rgen Huitfeldt. I see. J?rgen Huitfeldt, J?rgen Kj?r Knudsen. That way we can tell one J?rgen from another. That's really nifty. It really is. - We had a visit from a suitor. - What was he like? I don't know. His name's J?nne and he uses a crash helmet. They went into town. - To do what? - Don't know. Lars came by and asked for Mette, so I didn't know what to say. What did you say? That she was in town with J?nne. He wasn't too pleased. Do you know what time it is? You said, you'd be home by midnight. Mette, aren't you feeling well? Are you sick? That smells. How much have you had to drink? How much? Mette, you can't go to bed like that. At least take your jacket off. Come on, Mette. Help me out a bit. It's not funny. Get to bed. Come on, Mette. Mette, come on. Grab that side down there. I have a headache. Especially when I bend over. I can understand why. - Was it a nice studio? - Yes. I think so. - And you had a little to drink? - No. Just some eggnog. Something he bought in Germany. It's a kind of liqueur. Am I doing this wrong? Here's Mini. It'll be raucous. - That's me. Are you painting? - We were just about to. - It's going to look nice. - Don't you think? We're going tobogganing. - Do you want to come? - I promised to help painting. - That's too bad. - Have you seen the Strangler? - He hides in people's closets. - We haven't seen any stranglers. - I'll take a look. - Thank you very much. Do you really need to help? It's such beautiful weather. When Drude asks, I can't say no. He wasn't in here either. Have you seen my new pants? So, Drude, how's the poetry coming? - Have you written any more poems? - Yes. Three. - I've written one that rhymes. - Let's hear it. "People, nothing but rooftops. Shelter from sorrow and rain. And dark winter days in vain." - That sounds promising. - Yes. - Albeit a bit pessimistic. - I forgot how it ends. "And dark winter days in vain. Waiting for a bus that left." All right... Mini did the ending, just to be funny. There's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's good enough. How are you two getting along? Quite alright. I mean, we do have our problems. Mini thinks, it's time we slept together, and I disagree. I see... That just goes to show you... - Aren't you coming, Drude? - I'm talking to your dad. - A little waiting never hurt anyone. - That's what I say. What about all your friends? Are you sleeping with each other? Some do. One girl's living with a 37-year-old. But they aren't part of our group. - You're a bit more innocent? - Yes. For now. - That J?nne, do you know him? - Yes. What do you think? Is he right for Mette? - No. - He's not my favourite thing either. Lars is much nicer. It's so wild. - Would you like to try? - No, it looks a bit dangerous. - Just steer clear of everything. - That's what you say. Come on. - Isn't it funny? - Yes. You can have this one. - Did you hurt yourself? - No. Watch out! Watch out! Bully! I'll be back soon. - Mette? - Yes. Good evening. There's something I would like to show you. We took them yesterday, and then I developed them today. - So Drude was also there yesterday? - Yes. We called her. And she got drunk as well? I had some eggnog from Germany. Mette thought it was candy and had a bit too much. That can be dangerous. - Can I offer you a real whisky? - Yes, please. - Do you want some water or coke? - No thank you. - Ice? - Let me just get it on the rocks. You'll get it on the rocks. - Cheers. Merry Christmas. - Thanks. You, too. Oh, it's Chivas. That's the one I buy, when I can afford it. - It was a present. - Or Black Label. - You don't drink American whisky? - Bourbon? I don't buy that. So you're up here boozing? - Aren't the pictures great? - Yes. Have you had dinner? - A burger. A double burger. - I made pizza. - I'm not hungry. - Do you want a whisky? - Just a taste. - I'm afraid I don't have any eggnog. I've had enough of that. - I'm getting a headache again. - You have to be careful. - But you can stand some more, right? - Yes, please. On the rocks. Cheers. So you're not in Mette's class? No, I'm in second year HPE. She's in the normal upper secondary school. "Copyright Star Studio." You have to do that, or else people will copy your pictures. Star Studio, that's a very fancy name. Well... It has to be called something. So you really do own a... studio? Yes. In town. I want to become a photographer. And you're also some kind of mannequin. No, a model. But I only do it for the money. It's a stupid scene, and you have to make a fool of yourself. - But there's a lot of pretty girls. - But almost all of them are daft. Well, a few of them are university students. - All right... I see. - But I only do it for the money. But it's hard. It's a job like every other job. - And you get to be in the paper. - That's true. Everybody's an exhibitionist. But I want to be behind the camera. But I don't want to do commercial photography. - What do you want to do, then? - I want to create new perspectives. A bit more artistic. I really like to do portraits. Like that one. Yes. What is it about portraits you like? It's about finding a new truth. Or a secret about the person. As opposed to the photographers on the high street. Their job is to create a lie, so people feel good about the picture. I'm going to bed. I have a headache. - But don't mind me. - J?nne's having another whisky. - Good night. - Good night. Well, J?nne, I'll pour you another whisky. So you found out the truth about Mette in that picture? Well... - Some of it, I think. - Yes. - Do you smoke? - Yes, please. Explain to me, which secret you found out about her. It's got something to do with the expression in her eyes. It's not beautification. In that case I would have made it differently. Yes. I think the picture of Drude is much better. Yes. She's very photogenic. Very good. Bravo. And a smoke ring. It's nice to visit somewhere, where you're welcome. - How do you mean? - Fathers can be really crazy. One time this guy ran after me with a frying pan. With Teflon. But some parents react differently. They're practically honored. They like that their daughter's found a hunk. - Really? - I know I look good. Otherwise I'd be lying. That's why they use me as a model. That's true. I, too, know deep inside, that I look good. - You don't believe me? - Sure. - What's that. - That's my karate emblem. - You practice karate? - I'm a black belt. - Is that particularly fancy? - It's the highest rank. - What are you writing? A book? - You can read. Read aloud. "The self-existence of the mirror image is pursued - - because the lather lends qualities to the self, that are fictitious." Go on. "All the white lather, that covers my stubble, - - makes me an old geezer." - Do you know how to touch type? - No, but I type fast. - Try it. - Do you think I'm too drunk? "Mr. Karate Champion J?rgen..." How do you spell Huitfeldt? - H-U-I-T-feldt. - Type it yourself. H-U-I... oops... - Huitfeldt. - F... Huitfeldt. - Huitfeldt. - D-T. - Huitfeldt. - Huitfeldt. Can you do this? Huitfeldt. That one goes in there. Like that. Then we ask the pinky finger how many beers you can drink. By tapping your finger. That's good. Then we'll ask the thumb. How many fags can you smoke in a row? That's very good. Now we'll ask this one. How many times can you run up and down the stairs? You're in great shape. Then we'll ask this one. How many times can you make love in a row? Huitfeldt. Wake up, J?nne. You can't just sleep here. Come on, J?nne. Wake up, J?nne. Come on, J?nne. You must have taken a wrong turn. You should probably walk with your moped. Is that better? - And the neck, too. - A headache in the neck? That's all, folks. Now, we're even. - Let's get that room painted. - Well, excuse me. I've been waiting for you to get out of bed. Do you know what time it is? It's almost 1.30. I have to be somewhere. I'm leaving in five minutes. - Are you going to J?nne's? - Maybe. So he can find out some more secrets. What? So he can find out some more secrets. - I don't understand. - No, you probably don't. Now that you're sitting there all pouty, I've discovered something new. You have a double chin. A bit of a turkey neck. You're one to talk with that flab around your waist. That's not flab. It's an athlete's fold, and even you have one. What am I supposed to say if Lars asks for you? Tell the truth. That I'm ice skating. Can I tell him, that you're ice skating with J?nne? Can't you just tell him, that I'm ice skating? Can't you just tell him, that you don't know where I am? There's no reason to upset him, is there? No, I suppose not. I don't like that you go to that J?nne's place. Let go. - When will you be home? - Sometime tonight. Don't drink too much eggnog... on the rocks. Look. You can borrow this from me. Doesn't that make you happy? I really don't like him. Especially that air of self-absorption he has. I don't get why Mette doesn't see it. - She's a bright girl. - She's head over heels for him. - What does she say? - She hates me for meddling. I don't get why you dislike him so much. - Mette has to experience life. - This I'll tell you. There is a bond or some feelings between Mette and me, - - that are so strong, that they'll always be there no matter what. And along comes Mr. Smarty Pants and thinks he'll take care of business. What if I said, that there was a bond between my dad and me, - - that was so strong, that nothing could come between us? But your dad is an old fool. - Where is she now? - She's gone ice skating. But she outgrew her skates a long time ago. We'll see. I found my old skates. J?rgen, don't do that. Leave them alone. - Don't spy on them. - I'm on Christmas vacation, too. There's nothing wrong with me going to the skating rink. It's your choice, but I don't think you should do it. Why hasn't anyone ever called me J?nne? What's going on? We're playing tag in the dark. Mini's it. I just hit him. I see. No... Have you been to the skating rink? - No. - Okay. Kj?r Knudsen. Hang on. I'll see if I can find her. Mette! It's Lars. Hi. No. No, not now. Yes. Yes, J?nne, too. Lars, stop moaning. Maybe. Yes. That's a deal. Okay, bye. - There's no one in here. - All right. Who are you anyway? - I'm Finn, one of J?nne's friends. - I'm J?rgen. I live here. And that's my bedroom. - Can't you just stay downstairs? - All right. - Aren't you a bit too old for this? - It's just for fun. - You're playing just for fun? - Yes. We're playing tag in the dark. - Why isn't Lars here? - He can't stand J?nne. - J?nne's here? - Yes. - Where? - I don't know. Somewhere. Dad, please leave. I need to talk to Lars. I feel really bad for him. He walked around in the snow for three hours. He wanted to give me the tea pot back. It reminded him too much of me. I wanted to give him back his silver heart but he wouldn't hear of it. I really do feel bad for him, dad. I care about him. I remember presents going back and forth in my day. You'll settle this, and then he'll get his tea pot back. Why can't we just be friends? Why does it have to be so serious? I don't want to sit and stare into his eyes for hours. - I like Lars. - I do, too. He's just so immature. - Am I doing it wrong? - You're holding it like an axe. It's all in the wrist. You're crushing me with your fat belly. And I think you should do something about your paradentosis. And you could stand to go on a diet. So you don't embarrass me. You're talking to me like we've been married for 20 years. That's J?nne in a pyjamas. And here he is in underwear. Look, dad. - There he is in a pyjamas. - Yes, that's him, all right. And here he is in underwear. Those are some really spirited boys. And on the other page is pork. - This is Mette. - Kj?r Knudsen. That's so funny. I'm just standing here with a picture of you. You're in underwear. You've got nice legs. And on the other page is neck of pork with spam. And cheap ham. Hang on a minute. I'll take it downstairs. I'm back. Just a minute. Dad? Dad? Dad, I have to go now. I'm meeting someone. We've only just started painting. I know that, but this was arranged a long time ago. And it's got nothing to do with J?nne. It's true. I'll help out tomorrow. I promise. Listen, Mette. Could you go see mum? You haven't seen her since Christmas. Okay, I'll do it. But not until sometime this afternoon. If you're not going to see Mr. Smarty Pants, where are you going? I'm 16 years old. I don't have to account for what I do. I'm just asking out of interest. You have an annoying way of asking. I'm sorry. Maybe you've noticed, that I'm not too fond of J?rgen. Yes, and that's because he doesn't have any academic ambitions. It's got nothing to do with that. He's a charlatan. I'm rather disappointed, that you can't see right through him. He's a very suspicious fellow. Really? And by the way, you could be a little more modest. Don't run around the house naked. That's not easy the way you're staring! - Well, hello. - Hello. Is Mette here? - No. Should she? - No. Can I come in? Sure. - Hello. - Hello. Can we talk in private? - Yes. - I was leaving anyway. - I can make some coffee, if... - No thanks. What's this, then? I think, it's against the law to get minors drunk - - and then take pornographic pictures of them. That's a criminal offense. But they're not pornographic. They're really not. Aren't they? What's all this, then? What is it? What is it, then? - It's not pornography. - Well, excuse me, then. Is it art? Is that what you mean by "finding out secrets"? Christ! I'm sorry you see it that way. To take a good portrait the model needs to be stripped to the waist. That's the only way to get the collarbones in the picture. - You crop it afterwards. - But these aren't cropped. No, but I don't view the naked body as being pornographic. That really doesn't matter, when you sell the pictures to be on page 3. The papers don't care if you think it's pornography or art. I'll buy the negatives for 500 kroner. Shit. I don't want any money for them. I'm really sorry you see it that way. Look at the pictures. You can see she's not drunk. I really don't want to look at these pictures. And Mette is not a minor. Maybe not in terms of the law, but when you visit our home, - - you respect the rules of the house. Mette's a minor to us. So, how are you doing? Everything's the same. I'm a bit bored. - Nothing much happens here. - That's true. How's the painting coming along? Mette's got a guilty conscience. It's coming along slowly, but it's going to look nice. Mette would like to visit Liselotte in Aalborg for a few days. - Which Liselotte? - We went to school together. In middle school. She moved up to Aalborg. - Does Drude know her too? - Yes. We went to the same class. She'll be home on Thursday for New Year's Eve. - Did you get at good seat? - Yes. I reserved one. - When will you be back? - Thursday at seven past two. - I'll be here to pick you up. - Thank you. - When will you arrive? - In an hour and a half. - Say hi from me. - I will. - Say hi to mum. - All right. Take care. What about you? Are you going into town, or do you want a lift? I don't really know. I'd like a lift back. What happened that night at J?rgen Huitfeldt's? Christmas Day? Nothing, really. He took some pictures of us. And we had some eggnog. And Mette got drunk. - And then we took a cab home. - Why were you there? Mette rang me. She didn't want to go by herself. I see. And then he took pictures of Mette with bare breasts. Yes. It's the best way to do portraits. Yes, so I've heard. I'll just ask you. Has Mette slept with J?rgen Huitfeldt? No. That I can say for sure. She hasn't. - She would definitely have told me. - Good. And he didn't photograph your breasts? No, because I don't have any. What about you and Mini, that Casanova? Does he get his way? - No, I'm not giving in. - That's good. Hang in there. - He's not a bad photographer. - No, but he's a bastard. - She has the sweetest smile. - But who's she smiling to? J?rgen, you have to realize, that she's got a life of her own. I know that. I just hope that she picks the next one more carefully. - Why so you say "next one"? - That thing with J?nne is over. Nothing more will come of it. I'm sure. - He's not gone to Aalborg, too? - That's impossible. - It's in the past now. - Why are you so sure? Because... I went to the train station myself. - Oh. - You sound like you know something. I don't know anything. I'm just guessing. I could be wrong. Goodbye. - Mette? Is that you? - Yes. Why didn't you come get me? I'm sorry. I forgot. I've been painting. I took a cab. - Was it a nice trip? - Yes. I'm going to a disco tonight. Along with the others. It was arranged a long time ago. We were supposed to be at Mini's, but his parents are having company. I think you should stay with mum. She's been there for two months. I talked to mum about it. She doesn't mind. And the tickets are already booked. They cost 100 kroner. That's expensive. And maybe we can't even get in. The age limit is 18. - And it's together with Drude? - Yes. And Mini and Lars. It's going to be a blast. - But not J?nne? - I don't know. - I'll go paint some more. - Okay. Can I light it? - I thought you were steadfast. - It's New Year's Eve. - Do you want some more? - No, I've had enough. Just a tad more. - Are you tired? - A little. - How much is it? - 100. But the place is packed. - Can we get in later? - After 2 o'clock. - Room for two more. - It's packed. After 2 o'clock. - How much is it then? - 100 kroner. Can I go look for my daughter? I'll be right out. That's easy to say. She's under 18. It's illegal to even let her in. Okay. If you deposit 100 kroner. What a crock. My daughter's in there too, and she's only 11. What the hell? Isn't it Mette's dad? Happy New Year. Don't you recognize me? "That's my bedroom". Hey, J?nne. J?nne. How nice to see you. Happy New Year. This is S?sser. That's Mette's dad. Mette's right over there. - J?nne, isn't it a nice hat? - Thanks for lending it to me. - So there you are, Mini Casanova. - Who's that? - That's you. - Have you seen this? It's very clever. Can I have a bottle of champagne and five glasses? How about this? 300 kroner. For fuck's sake. Champagne for everyone. Happy New Year. Who wants some? - Nothing for me. - Oh... Drude, you'd like some champagne, right? - Yes, please. - Good. Grab a glass, whoever wants some. Cheers, everyone. Happy New Year. - Cheers. - Cheers. Would you like some champagne, too? Come join us. - Is your glass empty? - Yes. S?sser, you can have this, and J?nne finds a glass for himself. On the rocks... - Cheers. - Cheers, Mini. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Do you like it? - It tastes all right. Mette, that's too stupid. My car's right down there. Let go! Let go of me! Let go! This is Mette. I'll get it. Mette speaking. Hello. What are you saying? Hang on a minute. ...nothing. It's you I'm crazy about. Please come see me. I miss you so much. Don't you want to be with me, Mette? - Yes. - I can come pick you up. I can't. I don't know why you act this way. It's because I was trying to forget you. - Why are you doing that? - The trouble with your dad. - What trouble? - The trouble with the pictures. Mette, I really miss you. Can't you come over to me? - Has my dad been at your place? - He said, I was a criminal. Mette, I really miss you. This is really getting me down. Won't you come over? Please, Mette. Are you there? Hello? Mette? - I'll be there. - Promise? Dad! Dad? Are you in here? Why are you sitting in the dark? It was Drude on the phone. Everyone's at Mini's. They wanted me to come. That's very good, but you'll stay here. You've had your fun. It's after 1 o'clock. You can't keep on running around. It's right over at Mini's. It doesn't matter where it is. New Year's Eve is over, and you're staying home. Everybody else is up there. All right. If I can drive you there, then it's okay. Mette, you're lying. It wasn't Drude, who called you. Are you really that far out? Have you been listening to my conversation? You disgust me. I wouldn't have thought you'd do that. I'm so glad you came. It's the best thing that could have happened to me. Aren't you happy you came, Mette? It's not the reason why, but I just won a case of beer. You're not mad, are you? That's not the reason why, Mette. I'm really crazy about you. We'll share it. You really mean so much to me. I have to go now. I don't have the nerves to stay here. Maybe I'm acting in a foolish and degrading manner. But it's hard to get used to the fact that you're growing up. I thought, I was supposed to look out for you, but suddenly that was wrong. There's so much pain, you could have avoided. J?nne's one of the most stupid and self-centered people I've met. What is it? And that J?nne guy. Don't let him be your first. Because that's the one you remember. Dad, you can't be serious. That was more than a year ago. It was Mini. At that school camp. - Mini? - Yes. Oh... - Nothing happened. - No. You still look like a toad. Oh? Yes. - Good night. - Good night.
