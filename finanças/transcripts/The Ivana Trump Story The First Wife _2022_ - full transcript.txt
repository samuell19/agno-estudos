Am I... Am I okay here? Do I look okay, guys? This is the first year... I'm supposed to be with... I'm supposed to be with Clive Davis right now in Capri on his yacht. But I'm with you instead. My favorite story is when Ivana was up in Canada one time. She was selling jewelry, and she was describing this watch, and she said, "This is... This watch is gold." She said, "And the dial is mother of the pearl." "Mother of the pearl." It was the best. She always put "the" before everything. "The Donald." She was very funny. She had a good sense of humor. But she botched up the English language like you just can't even imagine. She said, "That's my charm." Ivana, How do you feel? I feel... I feel great. I feel great. ♫ Welcome to your life ♫ She was the Kardashians before there were Kardashians. She was Kris Jenner. She was the first influencer. I mean, who looked like that? Giant hair and all that makeup. The power couple of the '80s. Mr. and Mrs. Donald Trump. Glitz, sex, scandal. You name it, they had it. It was, "Look. We are so glamorous. We are so fabulous." ♫ Everybody wants to rule the world ♫ She had the same kind of raw ambition that he had. What if you had said, "Well, Donald and I are equal"? I would have been dead! She said she was his twin. She wanted to be his master, not just his mistress. Ivana was smarter than Donald. When they first got married, he made Ivana become an American citizen because he wanted to be president. He never would have been on "The Apprentice" without the image that she created. - You're fired. - And he never would have been president without "The Apprentice." I'm basically first Trump wife, okay? I'm first lady, okay? She would've loved to have been the first lady. You couldn't knock her down. She kept getting back up. That's... I mean, that's a role model to me. ♫ Everybody wants to rule the world ♫ What makes Ivana Trump tick? I love to live. I love life. I like to dance. I like to eat. I like to work. I like my family. I like to travel. Uh, I like to live. And I think that I like to do things, I think that what really makes me interesting. It came as a great shock because she was very much larger than life. Ivana was hard-edged, aggressive, ambitious. Always perfectly attired. Always eye-catching. She was unflappable. Just like her hair. Nothing was going to deter her. She wasn't like anyone else. She captured the hearts of the world. Ivana Trump had balls. Like, real big steel balls. This woman grew up in communist Czechoslovakia. My childhood was wonderful. A lot of people say living in a communistic country had to be terrible. But I got opportunity to excel. She's an only child. When you're an only child, I think no matter where you're from, you have a very different relationship with your parents. They're on top of you. They're focused on you. They're giving you strength. She was involved in competitive skiing, highly competitive. This is a girl with a mission. And it's a little bit of luck, it's a lot of talent, and it's drive. And she had the drive like nobody else. So, for me, leaving Czechoslovakia and getting out of the country, which you could not get a visa. You either run or skied away or... or whatever. I just decided to leave. And, uh... And that was most important moment because it gave me a life in... in the West and in the land of freedom and opportunity, the United States! And we reap the benefit of you being here! When she got here, as many girls do who are pretty models, they get involved in the pretty-models scene. And she wasn't doing that. She treated it like it was a job. ♫ And so we'll run ♫ And she was looking straight ahead to find the right partner and create the right life. At that time, he was a very fancy, rich developer. Donald was a realty animal. But he didn't know Paris. He didn't know London. He didn't know a king and a queen and a princess if he fell over them, unless they tried to rent a three-and-a-half-room apartment. So she opened all of that to him. When Donald was 30, he made what would turn out to be an incredibly important decision, which was to stop off at a singles bar on the East Side called Maxwell's Plum. And that was the night that he met Ivana Trump. What were your first impressions of Donald Trump the night you met him? He was just very smart, very witty. He was good-looking. And the all-American boy. Donald talked about the moment they first met on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." What was the "it" that let you know that this was it? We just got along well, and there was an energy level that was there. And, uh, you know, who really knows? Who can define what that is? She had the same kind of raw ambition that he had, the same absolute veraciousness and "stop at nothing," completely transactional way of dealing with the world. I look at that skyline, and I really say it's the greatest in the world. It's the greatest city in the world. I don't think at that moment in time he was thinking about getting married or having children. I'd really like to buy everything if that were possible. I think he was thinking about his career and finding a way to maneuver himself into the limelight in New York City. For both Donald and Ivana, each one was exactly what they were looking for. She was looking for a rich American, and, for him, she was this very glamorous blond model, really what he'd been after his adult life. They were kind of the funniest couple together. I mean, they were real outsiders. Here was Donald, who basically came from Queens and was trying to pretend he didn't. She was from Czechoslovakia, and she had an accent. And she was, like, out of nowhere, for New York City. She had a... a charm that people loved, even though they couldn't understand what she was saying half the time. And people would sit at dinner and they'd go... And then she'd turn her head and they'd go, "What did she say?" I think it's a terrific day. Giant hair and all that makeup and the crazy dresses and stuff. She didn't look like anybody we'd ever seen. Shoulders out to here. Perfectly made up. Security waiting outside the door. She loved her jewels. She loved her couture. She loved her heels. She loved to have fun. She was so adorable. And she and Donald were so much in love. Donald Trump's proposal to you. Is it true he said, "If you don't marry me, you'll ruin your life"? That's for sure. Doesn't sound too romantic. Okay. But we met in August. He wanted to get married in February. And I said I need a little bit more time to... to become to know him. So eventually we agree on April. So the threat worked. Okay. It work. Okay. There was an excitement to the relationship. I don't know if Donald felt that he had met his match, but he met some woman that he could really talk to. I think he probably fell in love with her 'cause she was so much like him. He was such a narcissist. It was like being married to himself. They were married less than a year after they met. And at the very last minute, Donald presented her with a prenup drawn up by his attorney, Roy Cohn, legendary fixer, and it was extremely stingy. My prenuptial, I did not understand what I was signing. Uh, I was younger and I did not speak very well English. And, uh, I really... My parents never had one. It did not exist in communistic Czechoslovakia. During that last-minute negotiation over the prenup, she would say, "Wait a minute. I'm not doing this." I think it was very indicative of how the future would go. She was never trying to take over, but she did hold her own. I remember their wedding had all sorts of celebrities. Every single person who was anybody wanted to go or was invited because Donald wanted everybody who was there. And he was in his height. They were the talk of New York. Mr. and Mrs. Donald Trump. Young, tall, attractive, doing things. Ohh! Oh, no! I mean, they were the toast. It was the '80s. Nothing was too much. Noth... It was just unbelievable. '80s New York was really fun. It was over-the-top. Money was important. Ivana and Donald were all over the social pages. And I think they went out almost every night. You couldn't get anything hotter. Both of them adored publicity. Both of them wanted... Although they said, "No, no. No pictures," they would walk right to wherever the photographers were. They were strivers. They were striving to be the best and the most accepted and to be part of the whole fancy social scene, which they never really were. They were always kind of laughed at. People looked their noses down at them as... as very gauche. What Ivana exemplified, and really much of that era of the late '70s, '80s exemplified, was a kind of greed, a kind of focus on material wealth, on shininess, glitziest, getting more, more, more, more, more. She created Donald Trump. Because we can do it. We can... You know, Donald Trump was just some guy with a rich daddy, wanted to be someone. He was like, "I want this!" She was like, "And now I will get it done." She said she was his twin. She wanted to be his master, not just his mistress. That might have been partly where some of it went wrong. Donald was the Empire State Building, and she wanted to be the Statue of Liberty. ♫ Welcome to your life ♫ You'd have to have been living under a rock not to have heard the story of Donald and Ivana Trump. They were the golden couple of the '80s who seemed to have it all. Good-looking and glamorous, they were an ideal match, and their luxurious lifestyle, the best money could buy. ♫ Everybody wants ♫ ♫ To rule the world ♫ She could have been the pretty blond wife with beautiful clothes who lived in a fancy triplex in New York and went around with her girlfriends every day and did nothing but shop. She didn't want that. She had a big brain. She's done so much for Atlantic City. Ivana really wasn't the "lady who lunched" kind of type. She played the part, but she was a businesswoman. She was a mogul. Ivana called me one day, and she said, "I'm going to work for Donald." I said, "Why do you want to work? You just got married. Why would you want to go to work?" She said, "No, I'm gonna work hand-in-hand with him." She said to Donald, "I want to work with you." "Ivana Work." That was one of the headlines on the Post years ago. At that time, they looked like they were quite in love. It's a little bit different. And, um, he wanted to find a place for her. She got a "vice president" title at the Trump Organization and she oversaw interior design. Ivana was pretty much the personification of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," and I think she wanted to be, and it was part of their marketing. It was "Look. We are so glamorous. We are so fabulous. Aww. You cannot be us. But you can!" Remember she came from communist Czechoslovakia. Ivana Trump was Eastern European, and it's kind of like dictator chic, right? Like, there's a lot of gilt, there's a lot of gold, there's a lot of mirrors and white carpets. Like, if it ain't baroque, don't fix it. That's Ivana. And she made that Trump's, like, inimitable style. The first time I saw her, I was working on the Grand Hyatt, and she was walking around with Donald, and I just went, "Whoa." She was just gorgeous. Then Trump Tower came along. Ivana went to Italy, and she bought a mountain. It was like... I can't tell you how gigantic it was. And it had... It was the pink marble for the lobby. And she and Donald worked hand-in-hand on building the Trump Tower, which was an amazing feat and really changed the skyline, as Donald did with many of his developments, of New York. Ivana even goes on "This Old House" to show off the interiors of the newly built Trump Tower. What is all this? These walls are superb. It's a mural which was painted by the German artist. They were commissioned by us. And you can see the very beautiful workmanship. 24-karat gold. - Yeah. And they spent two months from morning to evening to working on this. By the time Trump Tower was done, he was a big, big celebrity. He is a chip off the old block. - My... My father, Fred Trump. - This is... Right. He made it known that she worked in the business. She was "with me in the business." Ivana and Donald Trump, congratulations. Thank you so much, Nikki. Thank you. It's like having a baby, right? Tonight you gave birth. My second one, right? I believe that Donald Trump respected her power and her vision. He could trust her, and she worked for the company. When she was working, she was a company girl, 100%. I think they were very similar because she was incredibly ambitious, incredibly forward, and not shy at all. She promoted herself. She promoted Donald. She promoted all their buildings. She promoted like crazy. When Ivana referred to her husband, she famously called him "The Donald." Do you really call him "The Donald"? I really started it. I wasn't sure... It's my bad English, I suppose. So it's "The Plaza," "the apartment"... - It's... Yes. - "The husband," "The Donald"? - Yes. - Okay. Miss Trump? Miss Trump? She was the Kardashians before there were Kardashians. She was Kris Jenner. Ivana was the neck that moved the head. I don't know that he would have done as well with somebody that wasn't as smart as she. Donald was bright enough... I mean, no genius... but Ivana was smarter than Donald. They were part of that solid Upper East Side. She was not part of the nighttime scene at all, ever. I was a little bit a part of that, and I'd call her and say, "Come on." She says, "No, no, no. I have a meeting at 8:00 a. m. with the contractors." "No, no, no. At 6:00, I'm on the helicopter to go to Atlantic City." And her kids... her kids were paramount. Donald and Ivana had three children... Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. She just knocked out those kids one, two, three. I love my kids, but I didn't want them to get in trouble. I wanted the discipline and the schedule. I think you... when you keep your kids busy, you know, they have no troub... time to get in trouble. She was tight. She was strict. She was a European mother. - We have an amazing mother, and she held us to a very high standard. My mother was much more the old-school Eastern European strong disciplinarian. I grew up surrounded... as a little girl... surrounded by strong female mentors. She didn't want to be your new best friend. She wanted to be your mother. And I was flying at 8:00 in the morning after breakfast with the kids for Atlantic City on the helicopter. I was there until 5:00, 6:00. I would come back home and to do homework with the kids, have a dinner with them, and then I would go... In '80s, I had to go and dress up in the ball gown, matching shoes, matching handbag, the jewelry and all that stuff. She must have been a good mom because her kids really love her, but I don't think she was like what, you know... "I can do at all." I think she was mostly business. People loved Ivana, and I think they were really a great couple. It's not enough for just one person to be fabulous and the other one to be sort of mediocre. She was as out there as he was. She was also as driven as he was. If Ivana wasn't involved in his business, there would have been no business. Donald Trump bought The Plaza Hotel and then put Ivana in charge. She was the manager of The Plaza. I remember he, um... he was interviewed about that, you know, and he made a joke. Does he pay you a very big salary for being...? Just can't get away. People always talk money around you, don't they? I get one dollar a year. One dollar a year. Do you have any other perks? Yes, all the dresses she can buy, and that costs me a lot of money. It's a lousy deal I made. That's one of my bad deals. A dollar a year and "all the dresses she can buy." And it was such a horrible thing to say. I mean, it was just... She was devastated by that remark. I mean, he was building her up. "She ran the casino, and she's now gonna do The Plaza Hotel." She felt very bad about that. She wanted to please him, and she wanted him to respect her. But I'll tell you, they had some kind of a party for her or something, and they were applauding her. And he was like, "Who the hell are you?" It was like he wasn't there. In his face, I saw the anger. "What the hell? People are admiring her? And I'm standing here?" There was tension between Donald and Ivana because she was becoming too popular and getting more press than he was. Everyone fell in love with Ivana, and I think, deep down, Donald resented it. She was the one you went to for The Plaza. She was the one if you wanted a room in Atlantic City. She was the one for everything. And she was taking some of the excitement away. He wasn't gonna have it. What if you had said, "Well, Donald and I are equal and I feel very independent"? I would have been dead! She was absolutely as ambitious as he was and almost more so. But the interesting thing is that she sold them as a couple, the branding as a couple, but her... probably her big mistake was to make him more famous than she was because he started to believe his own press. This is the Trump Tower. This is Donald Trump, financier, entrepreneur, consummate businessman, and the man behind the Tower project. And this is Ivana Trump, the woman behind the man behind the Tower. But make no mistake. Dedicated wife and mother, she is still her own person and has her own life with Donald. They were the perfect couple. Everything was so great. And then all of a sudden, it comes tumbling down. So, I was having lunch with Ivana one day, and just at the end of the lunch, I said, "You know, I've heard that Donald is cheating on you." She goes, "What are you talking about?" She was a diamond that sparkled. That's what he loved. It's just that, after a while, the diamond lost some of its glistening. How do you know if your husband's having an affair? Well, if the man suddenly goes and starts to exercise and loses thousand pounds and he is polishing his nails and he has the, you know... He goes and he buys the new suits and... and all that. You know, there are usually signs that this is something out of the character of the person. And if he didn't do it for you, who is he doing for? Did you see warning signs? Uh, I didn't. - Hm. - I didn't. He was seeing Marla Maples at the time. Maybe everyone in the world except Ivana knew this. For the first several years of Donald's affair with Marla Maples, he was quite successful at hiding this from Ivana. Marla Maples was a former beauty queen and an aspiring model from Georgia. Beautiful, gorgeous, a model. But soft, Southern, not hard-edged... no interest in going to construction sites, no interest in being anything but supportive. Marla was... She was totally, I mean, you know... "Look at me with this 26-year-old hottie." And then came Christmas, Aspen. Can you tell us what happened, what you felt, what you learned? It's still hard, isn't it? It's tough. Tell us as much as you can of that day. You're on the ski slope with your kids. Uh... I think it was just... It was said too many times. I don't think I want to go into it. I was at New York Newsday, and a friend of mine called me up and said, "Oh, my God. I'm on the ski slopes in Aspen. And Trump's girlfriend just had a confrontation with Ivana!" My girlfriend calls me. She goes, "You're not gonna believe what's happening," and this woman, Marla Maples. I say, "Who's Marla Maples?" She said, "That's Donald's mistress." I said, "What are you talking about?" She said, "And Ivana's crying. And she's skiing backwards and she's screaming at her." Marla just charged right behind me. And she said in front of my children... they were about five feet away... And Donald was just looking up like nothing would happen, so... She said, "I'm Marla, and I love your husband. Do you?" - Yes. What did you say? I said... I said, uh... I said, "Get lost. I love my husband very much." It was very unladylike, but it was as much as I recall. That was as much as I really... as harsh as maybe I could be. It was a very loud confrontation. And a lot of people heard it. The world reacted with total fascination to the soap opera of soap operas... Donald and Ivana, the power couple of the '80s, were imploding. It was everything you could possibly imagine. Glitz, sex, scandal. You name it, they had it. The whole world was just, "Donald and Marla, Donald and Ivana, Donald and Marla." He got caught, and Donald loved it. Donald didn't care. He loved all the publicity. I mean, my life was so great in so many ways... a beautiful girlfriend, beautiful wife, beautiful everything. I began to talk to Donald daily. Every single day, I talked to Donald. She, Ivana, called Liz Smith, who was my counterpart, and she told the story. Every day on the front page of the paper, it was, "I've never had sex like this before." What do you think of Marla? Um... I really... - The truth. ...don't want to really comment on it. Hm. She says she had nothing to do with the breakup of your marriage. Wow. Uh, she's the woman in... in Donald's life. I think that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing. I mean, we'll make... we'll do an educational program here, okay? If you're in business for yourself, I really think it's a bad idea to put your wife working for you. There was a great softness to Ivana, and she still has that softness. But during this period of time, she became an executive, not a wife. I think that was the single greatest cause of what happened to my marriage with Ivana. The couple that, for many, symbolized the '80s is splitting up. The Trumps have hit some bumps. It was very acrimonious. It was very nasty. "Ivana Better Deal." The best headline of 'em all! She was having such problems because of the children. Kids at school were telling the kids, "Oh, I hear your parents are getting divorced and your father's cheating on your mother." Her main concern was not subjecting them to this wrath of the divorce. The women were on Ivana's side, and the men, I suppose, were on Donald's side. They wished they could pull that off. So everybody had a stake in this drama. Donald wanted to make Marla acceptable, not known as a home wrecker. He would call up and say, "Oh, it's getting nasty," and then try to promote Marla. All he was trying to do was legitimatize Marla and make it seem like Ivana was just a big pain in his rump. It was pretty terrible, but Ivana, to her credit, kept it together like a trouper. I just wish him happiness. He's father of my children, and I wish him best. I hope that she makes him happy, and if she does, that's all what I really want for him. You're very generous about him. He's father of my three children. We have been together for 13 years. There were reports that last year Marla Maples wanted to make amends with you. She asked the Daily News in... in London if I would accept her apology. I said, "Apology is absolutely not accepted." I never accept her apology. She ruined my family and my marriage. I just call her the show girl. That's all. And yet you accepted Donald's apology. Why accept Donald's apology and not hers? Because he was father of my three children. Very good provider. So this is why. How do you forgive something like that? It's not just that he cheated on her. He was worldwide! She was shamed all over the world as this woman scorned. Ugh! You don't forgive that. In 1992 in the final divorce settlement, what Ivana got was $14 million, a 45-room mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. She got a month a year at Mar-a-Lago, plus $600,000 a year for raising the three children. That was seen very good at the time by most people. I thought she got a pittance of what she could have gotten. She got the settlement and she got that house in Connecticut. She flipped it, and, you know, immediately doubled her alimony, as it were. Did Donald want the marriage or does he say, "This is it; I have to separate"? Um, it really was my decision. Um, I tried for two months, as you know, until February. I tried to live with the idea that I've been cheated on and I've been lied to. And... And I decided, uh, that that's not the life which I want to live. Do you still love Donald? Uh, I don't love Donald as the woman would love a man. I do have affection for him. Would you ever take him back? I would not take him back because I think the whole story would repeat eventually again. Life goes on. You have to trust in yourself. You have to believe in yourself. If you have a confidence, you... you can really do almost anything. I think she was really the epitome of looking good is the best revenge and living well is the best revenge. She sounds different, she looks different, she is different. I was invited to the Citymeals on Wheels Power Lunch for Women. And that was, like, the big, big deal to get invited. And this blonde walks in with this giant Ronettes hairdo. Now, these are the most influential women in New York. They know everybody. And we were all like, "Who the hell is that person?" I mean, back then, in the early '90s, who got plastic surgery to really completely reinvent yourself? You never looked better. You want to tell us about the transformation? You were always beautiful. You're more beautiful. If you're talking about, uh, uh, uh, makeup, hair, or... I do believe that women should take care of themselves. I do believe in exercise. I do believe in health food. I do believe in plastic surgery if needed. I do believe in improving yourself. And we were at her house in Palm Beach, and I said, "You know, my fashion show is coming up. I want you to finale it." And she said, "Yes!" And we made her this rare pale golden sable coat. She did that runway show. It was a surprise. And the room went crazy. And we had her come out to the song "I'm Every Woman." ♫ I'm every woman ♫ ♫ It's all in me ♫ She managed to not look like the sad, scorned wife afterwards. I mean, at the beginning, she did, but... but post-divorce, she... she really reinvented herself. She came out, and she was like, you know, in that movie "The First Wives Club." Ladies, we have to be strong and independent. And remember. - What? Don't get mad. Get everything! That, still to this day, is a quotable line that I think a lot of women refer to when they think about Ivana Trump. She got what she wanted on her own terms and became the face for divorce, which for a lot of people, you still didn't talk about it. Ivana is the original first wife, a woman who turned an untidy divorce from billionaire Donald Trump into a battle cry for women everywhere to not get even, get everything. She absolutely followed the advice that she gave. She developed her own business empire... It's nice to see you. What a great collection this is, Ivana. Yeah, I'm very proud of it. ...became a multimillionaire... What we have in our House of Ivana is a line of cosmetics, as you see, the perfumes. I also have a skin care. We have a line for the body. We have a line of jewelry that you can see. - We're all wearing it. - Pearls and all that. ...and wrote books, was on TV, cameo roles, talk shows, advice columnist. ♫ Everybody wants to rule the world ♫ Ivana even does a Pizza Hut commercial with her ex, Donald Trump. May I have the last slice? Actually, you're only entitled to half. I mean, how great is that! You have this sort of public battle, you get divorced. The next thing you know, both of you are looking fabulous and you're making a national commercial. I said to myself, "Wow. What strength of character." What a woman, that she could forgive Donald. I think it was Ivana's way of, like, sticking it to Marla. You know, she figured, "Screw you," you know? "They want me to do this commercial with Donald? I'm gonna do it." After my divorce or my separation, I could not even look at a man. I said I don't want to see another man as long as I live! Cannot live with them, you cannot live without them. After Donald Trump, there were two more husbands, two more divorces, both Italian men. Everybody she went with was Italian whose name began with an "R." So there was Roffredo, Riccardo, Rossano... and somebody else. Wedding bells are ringing for one of New York's most colorful personalities. Ivana Trump is getting remarried. Ivana's new husband is going to be 51-year-old Riccardo Match... Mazzucchelli. So she married this very attractive, age-appropriate, at the time, international businessman. We actually traveled with him several times, and he seemed... okay. You know, she's not the easiest girl to be married to. She's important. She's in the limelight. And those were the days still where she couldn't step out of the door without the paparazzi. And I just think that that didn't work. Like marriages don't work. He was getting madder and madder and madder by the fact that nobody ever called her Mrs. Mazzucchelli, right? So I'll never forget... we went to Las Vegas 'cause Ivana was doing a book party. So Ivana all the tickets made out "Mr. and Mrs. Mazzucchelli." The room was in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Mazzucchelli. We go down to the show, and it's Wayne Newton. And Wayne Newton comes out on the stage. He goes, "Ladies and gentlemen, I am so happy tonight. My dear friend Ivana Trump is here!" And Riccardo got up, walked out. But he was a great guy. He was, like, really one of my favorite husbands. Do you want to get married again? Well, I'm going to be probably a little bit careful, but I've always been a family person. I always like to have a man with me next to me. And, uh, you know, I like the company of the man. And I don't think I'm going to be too long. She got remarried again, married Rossano Rubicondi. It was tumultuous, but who cares? Listen. She was fabulous. Rossano Rubicondi was much younger than Ivana. She was, like, the original cougar and proud of it. Again, this is in the '90s and early 2000s when most women didn't do this, or if they did it, they kept it quiet. Nope. Not Ivana. Donald's sister officiated the wedding. So, she pulled me aside. She hands me this poem, and I look at the poem and it says, "Thou lovest till thou the end of time." So I said to her, "You know, I don't think we really need this poem because I don't think the wedding's gonna last that long." "So let's just tear this one up." You know, he died recently, and I think that that was a big setback for Ivana. They spent a lot of time together. She remained friends with her last two ex-husbands. She even writes in her book, "Two of my best friends are my ex-husbands, Riccardo Mazzucchelli and Rossano Rubicondi." Up until they split, her life was very much about him. Afterwards... it was about herself. This is my dining room. Walking into Ivana Trump's apartment was like walking into 1985. Oh, that's so pretty! It was walking onto the set of "Dynasty." She had tapestries going up the wall. And she owned it. It was all her. You could tell she designed and had something to say with everything in her apartment. That interview with Ivana Trump, at the very least, I can describe it as memorable. - Sprechen sie Deutsch? - No. Nein. - No? - No. One of the most interesting, fascinating interviews I've ever done. She was direct. She was confident. You knew that she was somebody not to mess with. She had been part of the really early on creation and image building of Donald Trump that would ultimately lead to the presidency. He never would have been on "The Apprentice" without the image that she created. - You're fired. - And he never would have been president without "The Apprentice." She created so much of that Trump brand. I don't think she ever got the credit. There were suggestions from the start, from, you know, starting in mid-'80s, of hints of presidency, but it wasn't really a serious suggestion. In New York, building after building bears his name. He gets more publicity these days than almost any movie star. And some people think he should be president. None of us really thought that Donald was gonna be president. You know, um, I don't think Donald thought he was gonna be president. I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear... I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear... I think she was very proud of him becoming President of the United States 'cause it was something he always wanted. I remember when they first got married, he made Ivana become an American citizen because he wanted to be president. Many years later, that's what happened, but when he did finally get to the White House, I always felt like she was kind of in the shadows in some way. How often do you two talk? Talk about once in 14 days. That's pretty remarkable. She also said something about, "Well, I think that Melania must be jealous of me," which drove Melania insane! I had the direct number to the White House, but I not really want to call him there because Melania is there and I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I'm basically first Trump wife, okay? I'm first lady, okay? I don't think she ever made a slip of the tongue. She was much too savvy to go on national television and say, "I'm the first first lady. Oops!" I'm pretty sure it was a little dig. It was definitely a dig. I was actually there when she said it. And, of course, it resonated around the world. Everybody picked up on that in one second, and that became sort of the mantra of the story. In response to these comments, a spokesperson for Melania Trump told ABC News today... I don't think she ever said anything that was not calculated for a response. And she realized that Donald Trump's presidency created a lot of adversaries, but she maintained a certain royal status here in New York. Ivana! She was a New Yorker, and she stayed in New York and never seemed to have any interest in leaving. Her neighbors saw her walking her dog. They... She was friendly. She was respected and liked in her community. - How you been, Ivana? - Fantastic. You look beautiful. That even a walk on the street, and then people recognize right away. "Did you see? This is Ivana Trump." And then, "You think we should talk to her?" And then she said, "Yes, come, come. Ask me. What do you need to know?" She was a first lady. She's our first lady. She epitomized the ideal of the lady who lunches. But that wasn't her be-all and end-all. She always come, she always sit there because she sees everyone. She sees everything. She seemed to live life to its fullest and never shrank in any way. The hair never shrank. The shoulder pads never shrank. The very over-the-top clothing never shrank. The makeup. None of it. They don't make them like Ivana anymore, you know? She could be uptown in the penthouse, and she could be downtown on the pavement with the kids hanging out and being just herself and be the most unpretentious, the most amazing soul, the bright light in any room. I had been in New York for about two or three months and had seen quite a bit of Ivana. Hadn't seen her in a few weeks, and I was thrilled at the fact that she was going to Saint-Tropez. You know, Ivana was completely locked down when... when this virus hit. She... She just fell apart, basically. She didn't want to leave the house. She didn't want to go anywhere. She didn't want to travel. So it was... I was sort of thrilled at the fact that she was actually gonna make her first trip. And I was sitting in the apartment. And I got a call from my friend. And she said, "Ivana's dead." I was always afraid that Ivana was gonna fall down these stairs in this house. I had been saying to her, "Please, please, please be careful." And, you know, Ivana didn't want to have anybody in the house. She didn't want any security. She wanted to be... do her own thing, be with her dog. I got a phone call from The New York Times, actually. One of the editors knows me. And said, "Did you hear the rumor that Ivana passed away?" I said, "Now, that's... that's preposterous." After I called all the numbers, the assistant, the house number, Ivana's number, and didn't receive a response, I then quickly called Eric, and Eric sent me a text back saying, "Can I call you in a little while?" I said, "Okay," but I wrote back texting him saying, "Is Mom okay?" I was on my way home from Soho, and the news pinged on the phone. Was just in total shock. I heard this, I said, "How... How did Ivana die?" They said, "She fell down the stairs." When I found out Ivana died, I, uh... I just got a little sad. It's kind of like when a legend goes and you're like, "Well, pour one out. Tip that bottle of Veuve Clicquot. Boom. There goes another good one." Here in New York, a final farewell to Ivana Trump. At a historic Catholic church here in Manhattan. Ivana Trump's three children are expected to speak at that service. You know, it's... it's interesting. Because you never think about anybody's legacy until they're gone. I was born in Czechoslovakia, started from nothing. I went to West, started from nothing. I had to work for everything I have gotten. I think Ivana Trump's legacy will be a true New York story, one of a kind. She was the first lady. She was glamorous, beautiful, smart, fun, delicious. There wasn't anybody like Ivana. There's never been anybody like Ivana. I don't dwell on the past because that's over and done for all of us. People will remember her for being the former wife... of the past President of the United States... and the true glamour queen of the '80s and '90s. But, really, how I know she wants to be remembered... as a devoted mother. Discipline and confidence. I set myself certain goals, certain commitments. You know, courage. The guts, plain, simple guts, you know, to go down that mountain, or... or go and come out of the communistic country with nothing. Her love, her irreverent attitude towards things, and the fact that she was always overdressed and looking gorgeous really made it work. You know, honey, where the hell did you go?! It's, like, a little bit annoying. You left us too early. I'm not competing with the man. No, I'm competing with myself. But you have to try your best. That's all what you can do at any given moment.
