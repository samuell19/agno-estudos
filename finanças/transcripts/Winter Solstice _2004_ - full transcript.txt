Okay. Hey. Hey, babe. How you doin'? I'm crazy this afternoon. I had to send Ray out, so I'm by myself. No, no, no. There's-- There's no problem. I need to make it earlier. Gabe. It's up to you. No, 10:30's good. Are you ready? Yeah, I'm coming. All right, I'll meet you outside. All right, I'll see you then. Morning. Hey. Is your brother up yet? Yeah, I think so. You wanna have a bagel or somethin'? No, I'm good. Okay. Don't forget the propane today. Yeah, I know. Pete, come on. Get up. Pete. Wake up. Come on. Need some help? Here, try smelling that. You should try washing 'em once in awhile. Come on. Had your sleep. Fine. Listen, I can't drive you this morning, so you gotta go, you'll be late. Okay. You gonna wear this stuff? You're gonna need this for your regions exam. Now, remember, the quadratic formula is: X equals... ...negative B plus or minus the radical of B squared minus 4 AC... ...over 2A. Everybody write this down and commit it to memory. You will need it. Pete! Out, please? Thank you. Pete. Yeah? Um, Mr. Austin told me to tell you that he doesn't wanna see you today. Really? Yeah. Apparently. So I'm supposed to go back to class? No, no. Actually he didn't say that either. So? So you're just supposed to sit there for the rest of the day until detention and, um, think about your life. My life? Yeah, that's what he said. Well, what about it? You know what, he wasn't very specific about that, actually. Um, but perhaps maybe you could just, um, free associate a bit. You know? I do that, and it helps me. Um, some-- Just-- You know, center. And just breathe. What's goin' on, boss? What's happenin'? You got any shifts you don't need next week? Why? Just lookin' to take on a couple extra. I thought you might have a few you don't need. Why? Extra shifts, extra money. You all right? Yeah. You already work, like, six days. Yeah, I wanna pick up some doubles. Why? Help me out? Yeah. You can have Friday. Yeah? All right. Thanks, man. Gabesy... you're a fucking weirdo. Thanks, sport. You got it. Good shot. Thanks. We're all done, Bill. Thanks, Jim. Why don't you go wash up. They grow up pretty fast? How are your guys doing? Good, I guess. Yeah. How are you doin' otherwise? Good. You know, the season's just starting, so it's all good. Jim, did you ever meet Sue's friend, Elaine? From the hair salon on 33? No, I don't get down to the hair salon all that much. No. No, she's been to some of the games with us. No. You know me, I wouldn't... Just... Just thought you might like to meet her, you know. Yeah. No, I appreciate it. Yeah, that... But... It's okay, just-- Hey, listen... say hi to your guys for us, okay? I will. I will. You stayin' for dinner? I told you, I can't tonight. Right, right. Hey. Hey, Jim. You hook up the tank? Did you hook up the tank? No, I didn't get around to it yet. Why didn't you do it before you showered? Because Pete's supposed to help me, and he's nowhere to be found. Well, what's Pete got to do with it? He has to do with it 'cause it's his job and he's supposed to help me. We talked about this this morning. We all do equal amount of work around here. You ever lift one of those things by yourself? Yeah, about 600 times. Thing weighs like 90 pounds. Well, why didn't you get Stacy to help you? Because it's not Stacy's job to help me, it's Pete's job to help me. You guys busy on Sunday? I don't think so. 'Cause I was thinking we could drive out to Allaire and rent a boat or something. I gotta see about work. Yeah, I gotta see about some stuff too. Hey, you know, it's okay, you guys, we don't have to-- We don't have to hang out. Really? You don't have to get so excited about it. If I'm not cool enough... That's not it. Really? Then what is it? What? You think you're cooler than me? Well, I do better cutlet-breading. Yeah. No. Hey, the salt in this breading is crushing me, man. I tell you what. When you cook, don't use it. Okay? Amen. I don't. Good. I leave it on the table. Good for you, Pete. Salt is an option. You cook bland. I delicately season, yes. I can't even taste it when you cook it. Whatever. You fear seasoning, it's an issue you have to deal with. Okay. I'll spice it up for you. Go ahead. I'm not gonna eat it anyway. I'm gonna get a little juice to counteract the saltiness. Pete. I got a letter from your school about a parent-teacher meeting on Friday night. Okay. I'm just lettin' you know. Mr. Winters? Come on in. Have a seat. Well... as you probably know, Mr. Winters, I'm... I'm just Pete's history teacher, but I've spoken with his other teachers and with Vice Principal Austin. And...we sorta felt that since I was the only teacher Pete seemed connected to, that I should be having this talk with you. Okay, yeah. Well, first... Pete will have to go to summer school again. I know you've heard this before. Looking back at his record, I see that he was left back in, um... Pete was not left back. Um... He was away from school for a while, so he lost some time, but...he was not left back. Mr. Winters... we don't think there's anything wrong with Pete. It's just that there's no telling when he'll try and when he won't. It's like, he, um... Well, we don't know what. Must be very frustrating. For you as well. Come on, Robbie! He's abusing me. Nice. Nice. Did you see him? * Something you said * And your words Hit just right * What's the score? Seven to five. * And you and I both know * That this is not The easiest thing * Hey, Mr. Winters. Hey, Robbie. How are you? Okay, thanks. * Throwing the dishes... What's up? We need to talk. I'll be home a little later. We need to talk now. We have next game. I think we need to do it now, Pete. Later, dude. * I'm moving forward * Something you said That sucks. I'll be back, dude. Okay, man. * I'm seeing things for once In a whole new light * * I'm proving you right * And pulling teeth was never This much fun * What's up? When is this gonna end? What? You have to finish high school. Okay? Then you can do what you want. I understand that your life is your own, okay? But you have to finish. Have to? Yes, you have to. There's nothing wrong with your brain, your hearing aid. What the fuck does my hearing aid have to do with anything? When does this crap--? * To this 60 cycle hum... Are we done? Can I go? Just finish, Pete. Can I go? Yeah. Hey, Bob. Hey, Mr. Winters. What's up? Well, that lady down at the Wentworths' needs a hand truck, or some kind of dolly. She's asking about a hand truck, and I suggested, like, a dolly. I'm pretty sure you have a hand truck. Yeah, fine. Hey, wouldn't you guys rather help than just stare at me all day? Seems kind of boring, just sitting there staring. Looking tough. How about some cookies? Or cash! There could be cash in it for you guys. For some reason, cash doesn't work with them. All right, now we're talkin'. Thank you. Yeah, it's the... It's the local gang. A gang who refuses cash. Yeah, well, I would accept the cash. I mean, actually, I'd help you for nothing. But I'm really busy today, and I can't. So I... No, no, no, no. That's fine. This'll definitely help. But I could help you get this on. Thank you. I'm Molly Ripken. Jim Winters. I just live down the block. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Me too. So you're, um...? You're house-sitting. Favor for an old friend, yeah. House-sitting. Plant-watering. Various other things, I imagine. Lawn-cutting. Right. Anyway, which house is yours, so I know where to return it? Number 47. It's about a block and a half down there. All right, I'll get this right back to you. Hey, no rush. No problem. Okay? Thanks. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. So listen, we gotta have a talk here. Why is that? Well, it's... It's a decision I made. What's that? I'm gonna be leaving soon. Leaving. Yeah. What, you mean you're moving out and getting your own place? Actually, I'm leaving town. I'm wanna go to Tampa. Stay with Brian for a while and then maybe get a place down there. Why? I don't know, exactly. You're leaving town, and you don't have a reason? No, I have reasons for it. Well, what's your reason? Where do you think you're going? This is between you two. I want you to sit down over there, Pete. Pete-- Pete, get back in here and sit down! Hey, take it easy! Why didn't you talk to me? Gabe? Why didn't you talk to me? What about Stacy? That's my problem, and I'm dealing with it. And what are you gonna do in Tampa? Well, Brian says he can get me a job on his uncle's boat. I'm going to do that and get a place. See what happens. You're going to work on a boat. Yeah. I am. Look, I've been thinking about this for a long time. It's got nothing to do with you. I think you should sit down, Gabe, and we should talk about this. No. There's nothing to talk about. I think there's plenty to talk about. I want you to sit down, and I wanna discuss this. I don't want to sit and discuss. I want you to sit down so we can talk about this! Listen to me! There's nothing to discuss! Okay? I'm gonna get the money together, and then I'm leaving. It's a plan. It's settled. You know, every day this place just looks a little worse to me. I just... I can't get anything started here. You know? I'll be fine. Let me see your soda a sec? What? I'm not doing anything. Okay. I'm not dealing with this tonight. I know. All right, cool. Cool. Hey, Bender! How's it goin', man? It's good, good. What's going on? I'm awesome. Good to hear it. Just drive, okay? Dude, I'm fine. Yeah, what's up, man? Nothing, man. Don't fuckin' go anywhere, man! I'm right here, dude! Get in the fucking car, asshole. I'll be right here, man! Fuck. You fuckin' pussy! Ungh! Fuck, dude! Fuck! Dude. Over some stupid girl. Are you happy? No, my fuckin' eye! Pete? Yeah? What's wrong? Nothing. What's wrong? Nothing. Let me have a look. Why? Just because I wanna have a look. Dad, I'm fine. Come on, come here. Dad, I'm fine. Come here under the light. Just for a second. Come on. Come here. Okay, put your head up. Lemme see. In the light. Okay, move your eye to the left. To the right. Okay, just hang on a second. Piece of gravel or something. Okay. One more bit. Okay. Is that it? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. You okay? All right. Get some sleep. All right? Hello. Hi. Hi. Do you...live here? No. I was just trying to return this-- Hey, Pete! What? Someone's here to see you! Okay. Hi. I'm Molly Ripken. I'm house-sitting down the street. What's your name? Pete Winters. Um, I borrowed this from your dad, and... I'm just returning it and wanted to thank him. Or you, too, I guess, so thanks. Okay, you could just leave it. Okay. Are your parents home, actually? I think my dad's working, I'm not sure. Well, what about your mom? Maybe I can help you. Well, I just wanted to... invite...your family for dinner, actually. To thank you. I don't know a lot of people here, so I'm just trying to, you know, get to know people. You can come too, if you want. Well, thanks. I'll let my dad know, okay? Yeah, you can let me know what night's good for you and... Yeah, thanks again. Nice meeting you. Both. Bye. Bye. See what I have to deal with here? This fuckin' nuthouse. Gabesy. Hey. What's up, man? What's happening? Nothing. - Hello. - Hello. How's evening shift? All right. What are you up to? What're you guys doin'? Trying to rent a movie. Bernie told me about this big party in Clinton. Yeah, probably not tonight, man. You know? Just doin' our thing. Well, fuckin' Barry is on me about next month's schedule. So if you could just finalize that tomorrow. Yeah. I... I'm actually not gonna be on the schedule for next month. Why not? I'm, like, movin'. I'm going to Florida. I'm, like, leaving town, so... Wow. Yeah. You're just, like, gettin' up and goin'? Just fuckin' doin' it? Yep. Are you goin' too? All right, well, I should head. Do you guys want the rest of this? Get outta here. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. What do you think of these? They're a little overgrown. I think you're right. Listen, before I forget, we're having dinner with Molly Ripken on Wednesday night. Who? You know, Molly Ripken. You know, she's house-sitting for the Wentworths. She doesn't know anyone. She's-- You know, she's... She's new. So...? So...we're gonna go and have dinner there Wednesday night. Well, why do I have to go? Because you were invited. Well, why don't you just go? Because we were all invited. I already talked to Pete, and we're just gonna go. Okay? I'm workin' Wednesday. Yeah, you've got the day shift. You can be home by 6:30, take a shower, meet me and Pete by 7. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. You really think whats-her-name wants me and Pete to come to dinner with her? We're gonna have dinner with Molly Ripken Wednesday at 7. Live it and breathe it, Gabe. Okay? All right. It's not like I ask you to do a lot of stuff. All right. All right? Fine. These are good. Yeah. We're gonna take a look at history through its contextual perspectives. Which is a rather opaque but very impressive way of saying that if history is a story-- And it is. --we're gonna ask ourselves: Why are they telling it? Who's telling that story? Who are they telling it to, and how does that story change itself, modify itself over time? That's all part of history. I'm sorry. What's your name? Pete Winters. Pete... Pete Winters? Yep. Yeah. Okay. Here you go. We get started at 9:30. Sorry. So I'm sure you'll wanna get here then, so you don't... You don't miss anything. Um...could you do me a favor? What's that? Could you sit a little closer? Why? I don't know exactly. Well, shouldn't my seat be my choice? Just asking. How about this one? Okay, let's look at Mongolia. Fucks. You little motherfuckers. Hey. Hi. Welcome. Come on in. Thanks. I'm sorry, my boys are not gonna be able to make it. They were... They were busy so they couldn't come. That's fine. They send their apologies. I know you have probably made food for four, and now there's just two-- It's okay. More for us. Can I get you a drink? ...um... Water would be fine. Okay. Thanks. Please don't tell me you're a...vegetarian. No. Thank you. I... make a lot of chicken dishes. I know a lot of sauces. I like to experiment. I made a... ...Moroccan sauce. It's not too spicy, but... That's, um-- That's great. Just gonna... Jim, don't worry about that. No, no. Well, they're not coming, so there's no point in having it. Should we put those away? Okay. Um... Um... Where shall I put them? The people that you're dealing with, they have ideas, and you have ideas, and then you put them together and you kind of create-- You create this garden together. It sounds like bullshit, but-- No, that's a beautiful way to describe what you do. You obviously love what you do, and that's... Then, you know, there's the maintenance part of it. You have to... Which, in some ways, it's even more important. Because gardens fall apart very quickly, you know. You really have to take care of them. It sounds like a great business. Yeah. So you, um... It seems, um... You're here for how long? Three months. So you just kind of packed up your whole life, and you come here for three months? I happen to be in between jobs, and... What do you do? I'm a paralegal. Yes, I am. I don't know, I just... You know what, I just... needed a change of, um... address. You on the run from the law or something? I don't know, I'm just... That's how I make a living, but it's not what I love to do. And... I wanted to explore the other side of things for a while. I'm... I'm a bit of an artist...myself. Really? What do you--? Like, painting or...? No, um... No. I'll tell you what. I will show you what I do after dinner. Okay. It's beautiful. How long you been doin' this? A long time. Since high school, I guess. I wish I could make a living with it, but... Every now and then, I sell something. I guess it's, um... Guess it's a very competitive world, right? There are a lot of jewelers out there. Yeah. But it's beautiful. I mean, the detail is really amazing. Thank you. Can I get you some more coffee? No. Actually, um... I have to go. Um... Okay. I have-- I have a really busy day tomorrow, and I gotta get a jump-start on it, so... Sure. Thanks for coming over. No. Thank-- Dinner was great, thank you. Tell your boys I'm sorry they missed it. I will. It's okay, I'll let myself out. Okay. All right, thanks. Good night. Good night. Shit! Fuckers. Pete. Pete? What the fuck did you do? What the fuck did you do? Didn't do shit. Well, what is this? Why are our beds on the lawn? 'Cause we fuckin' missed that dinner with that fuckin' woman down the block. Did you try the back door? Yes. I tried every fuckin' thing, it's fuckin' locked. I'm sleeping! I can see that. Comfy? Shut up. Wow. Dad has lost his mind. He's a complete maniac. God. What the fuck? Aw, fuck. Well, it's not here. Dude, how could you get a paper without a sports section? I only got it for the sports section. I don't know. Dude. Yo, why don't you go see if he'll trade? Why don't you go ask him? What brought this on? Me? You just-- I don't like him, man. Why? He's not gonna bite you. Just go ask him for the paper. I didn't do the homework. Man. God! Hey. Do you think we could trade papers? What for? We need that one for the scores. Is that today's? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Mind if I finish my article? No. Go ahead. All right. Have a seat. No, I'm good. You could have done it. He likes you. What's the--? Damn, what took so long? What, he make you buy it or something? Check San Francisco-- All right. Hey, Stace. It's me again. Just... wonderin' where you are, again. I don't know, I keep calling you and you're not calling me back, so... Just call me back, please, when you can. I figured you'd at least want to say goodbye, even if you didn't feel like hanging out anymore. So... just... get back to me. All right. Bye. What's up, man? What's up? What you know? Hey, hey. You all right? Good. Good. Good. Hear you're leavin' town. Yeah... Cool. So listen, man, where's your sister been? Just around, I guess. Well, she's not really, 'cause... I've been to your house, I've been to school. Been leaving her messages. Have you been givin' 'em to her? Some of 'em. Come on, man. How many times I buy you beer? Can you help me out here? Sorry, man. I don't know. You want me to camp out on your front yard and wait for her? Hey, there. Hey, Stacy. Gabe's still at work. I know. I just, um... wanted to return some of your stuff, or Gabe's, I guess... You know. Cool. I don't know, I think some of it's yours. All right. Maybe that little--? Nice. Been lookin' for this. How long have you had this? I told you about that a million times. You never came by to get it. Hey, you still owe me a game, you know. Yeah. You and Gabe still not talkin'? It's better this way. I mean, there's not really much to say. So... Well, you know you're welcome here anytime. We'd love to see you, you know. Definitely. I'll be around to say hello. That'd be great. Well... Well, I better get going. You take care. In the spring of 1238, having conquered most of eastern Europe, Hungary having just crossed into Austria, the Mongols decided not to press on and basically roll up the rest of Europe like a carpet, but turn around... and go back home. Anybody know why? Rebecca? Don't feel bad. It's considered one of the strangest events in all of military history. The Mongolian army, greatest, most efficient army ever been seen, was about to take Europe, but they didn't. Hey, you know why? What if I gave you the day off if you could tell me the answer? You will? Why? Do you know? The strategy guys couldn't agree on where to go next. Okay, that's part of it. What's the main thing? They found out their leader died. All right, off you go. They found out their leader died, Genghis Khan. And with that... Hey. Hey, what's up? Nothin'. What, no school? No, I was released early. You work tonight? No, I'm just packin'. Cool. Hey. Hey. What are you doin'? Nothin'. Whoo! Yeah! This is the life. That's the stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah. So Florida? Yeah. You know what I was thinking the other day? What? You don't know anything about Florida. I mean, you don't. Do you? No. Yeah, that's what I thought. I'll tell you though. I'll bet Brian lives in the most boring city there. Probably, yeah. It'll be warm, though. Well, you gotta do what you gotta do. So must I! Hey. Hey. What are you doin'? I'm just goin' through some stuff. Well, it's gettin' late. Maybe you should finish up tomorrow. Yeah. No, I'll clean up. Where did you find this? It was under the stairs over there. This is her stuff. You can't take this. Why not? Because it belongs here. Says who? Says me. Hey, you better clean that stuff off. There's dust all over it. Hey. Hey. Nice night. It's beautiful. So this is where everyone hangs out? Yeah, it's kinda like, you know, the local community center. Do you wanna get in? Sure. So how's the,...? How's the town treatin' you? I've actually made a few friends. Really? Yeah. That's good. It's nice. No. No. No, I've-- I've never been married. I... I was engaged once, but it just didn't work out. Well, I'm sorry about that. No, don't be. Because it would've been a huge mistake. I was married. I mean, I haven't been now for, five years. My wife died in a... In an accident just south of town. Wow. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. She was picking up, um... my youngest son from baseball practice and on the way home, she was at an intersection. And there was this guy, he was comin' the other way. And he was trying to, um... Tryin' to beat a yellow light. But it was raining. And he changed his mind, So he tried to-- He tried to stop... um... but... it was too late. The car went into a skid and just... skidded right through the intersection, and he slammed into my wife's car. She... She died on the way to the hospital, and... I never got to speak to her again. You know, it could've been-- You know, it could've been worse. You know. I mean, thank God Pete made it through it. Was he okay, or was he...? Yeah, he's okay, more or less. You know, it's really weird... sometimes when I'm concentrating on something really hard, or... in the morning, you know, just as I'm waking up... I forget. Just-- Just for a second. But I forget. You know, there's this really strange thing where everything that you built your life on, everything that you think you are... is just gone. It's just gone. Gabe, you got some mail. Okay. Do you have a forwarding address for Brian yet? Yeah, I took care of it. Thanks. Do you want a hand with that? No, I got it. Nah, it's kinda difficult. You have to push down here on the plate. I got it. God, it's bent. Yeah, I know. That's why have to un-- I got it--! Damn it! Sorry. You all right? Just go inside. Don't talk to me that way. Just remember where you are. Right. Sorry, what? What did you say? Forget it. No, don't forget it. What did you say? Why don't you just say it? I know what you're thinkin'. This town is for losers, right? I never thought that. Well, that's how you act. You promised that you would try and work things out here. I did try to work things out here. It doesn't really look like it. Do you know how hard it is for me to make all of this work? You think it's easy for me? I don't wanna do it anymore! Who's askin' you to? Who's asking? You've had eye on the door ever since your mother died! Bullshit! That's a fuckin' lie! You know what? It's not my fault that she's gone! I never said it was your fault! You ever think for two seconds that maybe I had to go and do something for myself? For once! For my life? And what're you gonna do? Go live on Brian's couch? Yeah, Brian's couch! Something for me for a change! For my life! No, no, no! This is your life! This is your family-- Go inside! Don't you ever talk to me that way! * Be this sunset Soon forgotten * * Your brother's left here Shaved and crazy * * We've learned to hide Our bottles in the well * * And what's worth keepin' * Sun's still sinkin' * Down * And down * Once again * Down * And down * Gone again * Be this sunset One for keepin' * * This June bug street Sings low and lovely * * Those Band-Aid children Chased your dog away * Hey! How are you? Good. Beautiful today. Yeah. What are you up to? I'm taking the boys out to dinner tonight. Nice. Hey. I'd like to see you again. Can I call you? Sure. You got a pen? Not on me. Maybe just drop by, then. I'll do that. See you later. See you. Would you, um, pass me your spoon? They took mine away or somethin'. That was good. Yeah. Thank you. So I'm wondering why Mrs. Ripken wasn't invited. 'Cause I know she likes dinner with the family. You are such a smartass. Here's your cake, smartass. I feel like a jerk now. That's beautiful, thank you. It's all right. "Good luck, Gabe." All right. You have to cut it. I'm gonna. Do you wanna do the honors? Yes. No, no, you have to cut it. Me? It's, like, tradition, you gotta cut the cake. You don't want me to pass the torch? You gotta cut it, so you can make the wish. It's your night. I was gonna pass the torch. Gimme the first piece. You get the luck piece, all right? Let's see, what do we want here? I want a lot of frosting. Okay. Hey. Hey. Thought you were asleep. Nah. Pete? Yeah, I think so. You let him drink wine with dinner, he passes right out. You got a spare one of those? What time you leavin' tomorrow? I'm thinkin' like 6:30. Get an early start, Yeah. That's good. Listen, Gabe,... About the other day... Forget that. It was... I don't know what that was. It was... stupid. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Begonias are comin' up nice. Yeah. Lookin' good. Get some sleep? All right. Good night. Night. Pete. Time to get up. Come on. Thanks. It's okay. How's it goin' there? All right. Is that everything for back here? Yep, that's it. - Thanks. - Yeah. Thanks, man. Yeah. All right, that's it. All right. All right, man. Take care of yourself, all right? Yeah, you stay in touch, bro. All right, man. You make sure and call us when you get to Brian's, okay? Yeah, I will. Hope this thing makes it.
