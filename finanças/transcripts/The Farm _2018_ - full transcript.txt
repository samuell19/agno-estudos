I just didn't remember it was gonna take this long. I'm sorry. Are you going in the right direction? I know where I'm going. So when's the next rest stop? Um, I'm not sure. They put them every X-amount of miles that's coming up. - I really have to pee. - Want me to pull over? No. I wanna go to a rest stop. All right. You're gonna have to hold it for a little while. You know I can't do that. Are you sure? Yeah, I mean, we'll see. Hello! I'm just gonna go in the back, okay? All right. I'll wait for you in the car. I wish you had came and seen the tents with me. I just wanna stay in the car and try to just like push through. No. It was like an abandoned site. - Tents. - Just can't wait? Yeah, people don't just up and leave their stuff. They take their belongings with them, their clothes. Maybe they were throwing it away. Just left it there. Maybe it was like broken. Oh, we're getting low on gas. Got like a little less than a quarter tank. We'll stop soon. Are we coming up on a gas station soon? They'll be one soon. They put them on points along the road. Hey! How's it going? I don't know. It just died all of a sudden. Is it the battery do you think? I don't know. How should I know? Well, I got jumper cables. I can try to start it. Yeah, do that. So are you from around here? Yeah. So where's the ring? Excuse me? You know, where's the ring? He's not your brother, is he? Um... That's really none of your business. Well, with you standing there, I'll make it my business. It's people like you that think they can have everything and not take responsibility for anything. We're trying to help you. Help me? Did I ask for help? You stopped and... that no-good boyfriend of yours or whatever you call him, he doesn't seem to know what's he's doing anyhow. Uh, I'm sorry. I... I don't know what the problem is. See? There you have it. You think he can build you a house? Let's get out of here. I'm sorry. Yeah, that's right. Go ahead and leave! Don't say it. Don't say it, okay? - 'Cause you told me so. - Mm-hmm. You know, it's okay. You just have to learn from your mistakes. If you wanna help crabby women on the side of the road, go ahead. I didn't know she was going to be crabby. I thought I was being nice. What? I could tell, even from 20 feet away from her, I could tell she was gonna be such a jerk to us. This is why I avoid the country. I know. 'Cause they're all like that. I don't know, man. She was having a bad day. Her car pooped out on her. Still, it doesn't give her the right to be rude to people who are helping. How's it going? Well, look at you, young and tender. Can I get y'all something to drink? Can I have a coffee, please? Sure. I'll do water. - Alrighty. - Thank you. You're not eating? Uh, sure. What's your special today? This is a diner. Have a burger. Sure. Can I have it with cheese, please? I'll check. How would you liked that cooked? - Medium-rare, please. - All right. And you? I will do the exact same thing. - You want fries with that? - That would be awesome. - Oh, me too. - All right. - Thank you. - Thank you. Be right back. "What special is on today?" I don't know what to order when I come to a diner. Maybe she likes making something special. - Oh, thank you. - And for you, water. Thank you. - It's good. - Hmm? - Mm-hmm. - Can I get some? - Sure. - Oh, thank you. Mmm. Oh, my God, I should've got a coffee. - Thank you. - Cheese. Thanks. Thank you. Enjoy. Okay? That guy. I'm sure he just likes new people. Let's go. Okay. - I'll get this. - All right. You're not safe here. Hey, what's going on? Uh, nothing. - You okay? - Yeah. Let's go. You okay? Yeah, no, I'm great. What was up with that guy? No, yeah, he was just being weird. Local weirdo, I guess. I don't know. I just never, you know... I don't wanna think about him, you know what I mean? No, he's harmless, I'm sure. All right. - Just making sure you're okay. - Yeah. Man, it feels good to stand. Do you need any help with anything? No, I got it. Hi. Hi. - That'll be $50. - Cool. And these, please. 58.40. Here you go. Here you go. You know if there's like a bed and breakfast around here? Bed and breakfast? Yeah, like a hostel or a motel or something like that? Oh, yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, there's some cabins down the road. On your right side, this guy rents them pretty cheap. Okay, so like up the road for how long? Maybe 20 minutes. You can't miss it. It's like a few wooden cabins. Cool. Well, thank you. It's my pleasure. - Have a nice day. - You too. - Yeah. - You too. Ah, this is gonna be good. I could use some sleep. Yeah, let's check it out, see how it looks and then figure out what to do from there. - What do you mean? - No, you know. Just make sure it's something that is not sketchy. I mean, if there's a cockroach in the bed, do you wanna stay there? I'll flick it out of the bed and then get in the bed and go to sleep. I don't know. That guy was... He was a little creepy and just... I don't know. What if he recommended us to his friend's place, and he's a creep too? - What if he did? - I don't know. It's just really unsettling. I'd rather just go. Let's just go. Wouldn't it be much nicer to just stay at home? Yes, it would be, but I'm tired, and I don't want to get us into an accident, okay? No, I know. I know you do. You're lovely. I mean, I could fall asleep at the wheel, you know, but it seems like sleeping in a bed might be the better, safer option. - Think so? - Yeah, I think so. This place looks creepy. What do you mean, it looks creepy? No, seriously, I don't want to stay here. - Are you serious? - I'm scared. Look how many cars are around here. Come on. Come on, just give it a shot. Come on. No, I don't wanna get hacked up in the middle of the night. We're not gonna get hacked up. Look how many cars are here. None of which are police cars. Somehow I think we are okay. You're so reassuring. Plus, you wanna know something? - What? - I'm deadly with a knife. That's kinda cool. Come on. Hello? Okay, no one's here. - Come on, let's go. - Hey. Hey, hold on, look. People have been here. Relax. Hello! It's kinda amazing. No. Nobody's here. This is... It's not ideal. There's plenty of people here. Hello? Hey there! Oh, hey. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys come in. Have you been here long? No, not that long. We're fine. Where you guys from? Los Angeles. Hey, I used to live out there myself. San Fernando Valley. So I suppose you two want a room? Uh, yeah, that'd be great. Wonderful. Just follow me. Okay. - Let's go. - Let's just check it out. If you don't like it, we'll go, okay? You're so... - Right this way. - Thank you. It's beautiful out here. It sure is. Here we go. - Welcome. - Thank you. There's a lot of beds here 'cause we used to rent it out to Boy Scout troops and church groups that, uh... They haven't been around here a lot lately, so I just kind of made it into a motel room. Cool. Hmm. So have you had this place long? Since 1989. Wow. I fell in love with it just driving by. I was driving, driving, driving. Uh-huh. Driving from everything I knew. I saw this place, stopped the car, walked in and asked if I could work here. Repaired the cabin, fixed things up. Been here ever since. Mrs. Anderson used to run the place. She passed away about four years ago now. Sorry. So I been running the place ever since. Nice. Uh, so do you get many people coming around here in the summer? The usual. Just a steady stream. Is there good hiking around here? Um, I'm sorry. Could you please excuse us? It's been a really long day. We can use some sleep. Yeah, sure. Just trying to make conversation. - Of course. - Not a lot of people stop here, so I like to talk to the people that do. I get it. - Have a good night. - You too. - Thank you. - Thanks. See you tomorrow. - A bit rude, wasn't it? - No, no, no, no. Shut up. It's fine. He's weird, okay? He seems nice. He doesn't have many people around here. "Steady stream." That's what I heard. So I'm sure he's got plenty of other people to go talk to. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to be nice to the guy. He's just a little too... repulsive, just him standing there talking so much. Repulsive? It's unsettling. Oh, my God. He's a monster. - Good night. - Good night. Alec! What is that? What is that? No! No! Hey, I said no! No! I said no! Get away! Get... You son of a bitch! Fucking... What the fuck! What the fuck did you do? You stupid bitch! Fuck! You fucking bitch! Help! Help me. Help. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey, man. All good? The food has to be ready to go in three hours. We're cooking for about 80 people. Are we even gonna have enough food for tonight? We really have to be on our toes with this thing. Do you think you can manage that? Hey, everybody! The food has to be ready to go in 2 1/2 hours, and they've added an additional 20 portions, so step it up a notch! We need 15 pounds of ground beef for the lasagna. Do we have that? We have some here. It ain't nearly enough. Looks like we have everything for the stew. And please, everybody, this time use a little finesse. Thank you! Hello? Ah, hello, sir! Absolutely. And what time were you thinking about coming by? Perfect. Okay, see you then. Shit. Hodder is coming. I guess we can use a bit of our diary livestock a bit early. We really need to come up with something special. And we have three more in the stable? And only one is ready? Hmm. Come on. You two bring the milk to the kitchen. Hey, little girl. Hey, little girl, what's up? You hungry? See? It's not so bad. You are out of your fucking mind! That's mean! You're sick, you fucking retard! Bad human! See? It's your own fault. It's your own fault! You're all bad! I'm very sorry you feel that way. Of course I did not intend to ruin your wedding. A tooth in the food? That's strange. I'll make sure to speak to the chefs about this. Yes, I understand. I understand it's too late now, but I want to make sure this doesn't happen again on your next order. Look, we'll cater your next event for free to compensate, okay? Please just think about it, okay? All right, okay, goodbye. You spoiled a perfectly healthy woman. "Andrew." Can't think, but he sure can feel. Go find Andrew. He must be around here someplace. Hey. Hey. What the fuck's going on here? You don't wanna know. How do we get out of here? You don't. They're spying outside of that rest stop where you were. They treat us like milk cows. How long have you been here? Two years. I've had one child and several miscarriages. That's insane. But soon it's gonna be over. I can't get pregnant anymore. I'm so glad I get to be done with this. Who is that? That's Ash. She's been here about two weeks. Ashley. - Yeah? - We're gonna get out of here. No, we can't. We will. I promise. They'll find us. They always do. Don't say that. It's nicer to play. But I don't wanna play. I just wanna eat! You have to be good! Eat it. Good boy. That's a good boy. Everybody can now play. It wasn't my fault! She was mean! She asked for my help, but when I came over, she wasn't nice! She yelled at me! She said I was out of my mind, but she's wrong! Sometimes my mind is out of me! I'm sorry. Why aren't you at the gas station? I don't know. I just... Just what? How many times have I told you to stop playing with the food? Now we have to dispose to two, possibly three perfectly healthy adults, one that would've given us milk for at least a year. Do you know how much that costs? I'm sorry. I won't do it again. I promise. Oh, of course you won't. Take him with you on your chores today. Don't let him out of your sight. You can start by feeding these ones. Mmm! Something smells good. And oregano! Perfect! Exactly what we need. Good boy. Hey, take two guys with you to the dairy. Take care of the one who can't produce milk. I'll take care of him for the rest of the day. Alec? Oh, my God. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Are they around? - No. - Come on, come on. - Let's get out of here. - Okay, I got you. - Come on. There. Okay. Okay. - We gotta go now. Now. - Okay. Come on. Nora. - Nora, they're coming. - Okay. Oh, shit. Come on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Patrick. Hey, how do I get out of here? Please, please, please, how do I get out of here? Please. The bus they used to transport us. There's a key in the room in the back of the house. You can find it by the window. Thank you, thank you. Ashley. Ashley, come on. What are you doing? How did you get out? It's okay. Come on, let's go. Shh! - They're gonna find us! - Shh! Keys. Come on, let's go. Keys. - Okay, stay here. - Okay. Okay, let's go. Run, run. Yes. Yes! Yes!
