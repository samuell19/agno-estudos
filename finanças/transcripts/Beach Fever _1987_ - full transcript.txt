I for one am sick to death of men who treat women like dirt. Like pieces of shit, like kumquat pie, easy meat, tuna salad, so I pledge my support to my female sisters everywhere that I Andrea Applegate ace investigative news reporter will stay on the job until I find the scum who is responsible for this filth and turn him into a citizen's castration comedy. - You know I don't know whether you could understand me or not, but I really want to thank you for getting me out of there.
