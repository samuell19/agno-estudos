A DAIEI CO. LTD. PRODUCTION What a downpour! I can't believe it! It even got in my ears. Lose my hearing, too, and I'll really be finished. Sure caught me by surprise. Is someone there? No? Then I guess I needn't worry about appearances. I'm sopping wet. I just hope it lets up soon. Still got water in my ear. Wow. Forage on scum like this and you'll get a stomachache. ZATOICHI AND THE FUGITIVES Produced by IKUO KUBODERA Original story by KAN SHIMOZAWA Screenplay by KINYA NAOI Cinematography by KAZUO MIYAGAWA Art Direction by SHIGERU KATO Original Music by HAJIME KABURAGI Edited by KANJI SUGANUMA Starring: SHINTARO KATSU YUMIKO NOGAWA KAYO MIKIMOTO KYOSUKE MACHIDA TAKASHI SHIMURA SHOBUN INOUE HOSEI KOMATSU JUTARO HOJO JOTARO SENBA HIROSHI HIJIKATA KOICHI MIZUHARA SEISHIRO HARA SHOZO NANBU ICHIRO YAMAMOTO RYUJI FUNAHASHI SACHIO HORIKITA HAJIME KOSHIKAWA Directed by KIMIYOSHI YASUDA Wow, it's hot! Amazing. The blind man fears no snake. - How do you like that? - So there! Say something, dear! Talk to me! What happened? This is bad. We need to get him to a doctor. That man's blind. DR. JUNAN Who did that to your daddy? Some yakuza? You just watched while they beat your father up? What could I do against yakuza? Please come inside and rest. Have some tea. I'll set it here. How does he look? It's pretty bad, but he'll live. We won't be able to move him for two or three days. Are you the one who helped bring Seisaku here? That was very good of you ‒ especially considering you're blind. We all need help sometimes. I should be going. Thanks again for your help. Thanks, mister. YOSHIDA INN YOSHIDA INN The folks upstairs are stirring up a lot of dust. I'm so sorry. I wonder if you'd be willing to offer your services. Sure. I was hoping I might find some work. Thank you very much. Some tea, sir. I'll be there shortly. Let go of me! Come on! Let me see it! Ugly dog. Come over here, masseur. Interesting fellow. I'll just get started. Are you folks perhaps part of a brotherhood somewhere? Brotherhood? No, we're not yakuza. - Just ruffians, then. - What was that? At any rate, you're not ordinary folk. What's it to you? Guess, then. Well, let's see. You'll never guess. Actually, I can. I've got a pretty good idea, but I value my life, so ‒ What? Never mind. Just muttering to myself. This spot right here feels awfully tight. Follow along this muscle and ‒ Idiot! Get out of here! - I've barely started. - Forget it. Get out. All right. You don't know your own strength. Normally I give a full upper and lower massage, but since I only did the upper, I'd like ten mon. You want to be paid? You barely touched me! - It's my livelihood. - Forget it. Get out! But, sir ‒ I told you to get out! Don't go, then. In fact, I'm not gonna let you go even if you want to. For a blind man, you've got guts. Here you go. Thank you very much, sir. So, blind man, what'll you do now? Look at this. The blind man's blood is red, too. What if I do this? Shall we take off one of your ears? Or would you prefer the nose? What's going on here? Go. If I'd come any later, your heads would have rolled. Don't be ridiculous. What could a blind man do? Never mind. Oaki and the others aren't here yet? No. Why are we gathering in a backwater town like this? I'll tell you later. You say that's the guy who killed Ino and Denji? Uh-huh. He's no ordinary masseur. - Damn that blind bastard! - Kumeji! The others are waiting for us. You can deal with the masseur later. Come in, sir. Thank you very much. Tobei! More sake! What happened to your face? It's nothing. Waitress, could you bring me a bottle? Did they kick you out of the inn? I left on my own accord. Here, have a drink. Thank you. Here you are, sir. Thank you. You're very good at that. You'll need a place to stay. I'm sure I can find some place. Tell you what. Come to my place. Massage, acupuncture, moxa ‒ they're all part of doctoring. You can stay with me and ply your trade. You think I'll be able to make money at your place? Of course you can. Now that that's decided, we can really settle down and drink. Hey, Tobei! Keep the sake coming. MATSUGORO MATSUGORO A woman? She said she needs to see you in private. - Is she alone? - Yes. Show her in. What is it, at this hour? My name is Oaki. I've come to request a favor. - A favor? - Yes. I'm looking for a place to hide. - You want me to hide you? - No. Six others and myself. Who are the six others? Not that band of fugitives? Actually, yes. Insolent bitch! Did you come here knowing I've been deputized by the law? I figured what safer place could there be? You expect me to let you go free after saying that? Who the hell are you? Here's how it is. We came to you because we figured you wouldn't just turn us down. We won't stay long. Just until the inspector of the eight provinces has passed through. What if I refuse? Look, Boss. You've already seen our faces. We can't take no for an answer. Wait! Stop! There's no need for that. All right. I'll agree to what you ask. But since I'll be risking my neck, I have a favor to ask, too. What is it? I'll tell you in good time. Fine. But remember this, Boss. You try to get clever and we'll take you down with us. Don't worry about that. I'm not going to tie my own noose. Have some tea. The wait shouldn't be much longer. Please pass the tray. Do you work here? Yes, I'll be working as a masseur and acupuncturist. Please give this to the doctor. Thank you very much. Oh, wow. Carp. Can't beat fresh carp as an accompaniment for sake. I'll mix some medicine for him, so come get it later. Take good care of him. Next. Somebody brought this for you, Doctor. Carp? That's perfect. Have this lady take them. But, Doctor, when I can't even pay my bill, I can't accept ‒ None of that. We need you to eat some carp and produce lots of milk. Tell Oshizu, Master Ichi. What's the problem? Show me your tongue. Oshizu, the doctor wants this woman to take these carp that someone brought. All right. Please don't. Don't worry about it. Here. - You're so kind. - Get well soon. Thank you so much. Does the doctor always give things to his patients? Uh-huh. How does he stay in business? INSPECTOR OF THE EIGHT PROVINCES TRAVEL QUARTERS Please come inside. Right this way. I hear that notorious band of outlaws is now in Musashi Province. So it seems. I'm told the string of incidents in Kawagoe, Kumagai, and Yorii were all their doing. They even kill women and children without hesitation ‒ a vicious lot. Actually, sir ‒ Was this a bad time? No, that's all right. - Who's this? - She's, well ‒ My name is Oaki. I came down from Edo seeking Boss Matsugoro's protection. I underestimated you, Matsugoro. You mustn't get the wrong idea. How long will you be staying? I'm scheduled for three days here, but one day should be enough, don't you think? Yes, sir, I have made the usual preparations. Your silk business seems to be doing very well lately. I'd hardly say that, sir. Last year's cold weather took a toll on the mulberries, and we're having trouble getting enough weavers. And I suppose that's how you can afford an Edo beauty like this? You needn't be that way, sir. You may rest assured, I won't scrimp on your usual consideration. Oaki, was it? You better watch out for this man. I'm quite aware of that, sir. Please, I beg you. How can I get it through your thick skull? Your daughter's term of service has a long ways to go. Please, let her come home. If you want to take her home, bring us the money. I'll bring her back to work as soon as she recovers her health. Please, sir. I beg you. Go home. Get back to work! That Matsugoro is really ruthless. He drives them like slaves without even giving them decent food. But that's no concern of ours. That's for sure. I don't know how much more I can take of this endless clatter. We're stuck up here in this sweltering sweat lodge. Put up with this just a little longer now, and we'll have the inspector out of our hair for a good long while. Kanzo, was it really a blind man who killed Ino and Deniji? That's what Oaki said. She has no reason to lie. Do you suppose it was the masseur from yesterday? If that was him, I doubt you guys stand a chance. The man's blind. One shot with this should take care of him. Forget it. He's mine. How do things look? The inspector will only be here one day. - That's good to hear. - Did you find the blind guy? He's staying with the doctor. Junan, I think it was. Junan? Does the name mean something to you? No. Nothing. Master Ichi? Yes? Shall we take a break? Your basket is really full. I probably picked a lot of the wrong kind. I don't think so. - What does that plant do? - It reduces fever. Thanks to you, we'll have a good supply. Have a drink of water. Master Ichi, how long have you been blind? Since I was about eight. Then you must remember a lot of things. Like what? Like the color of plants. I can distinguish plants by touch, but the colors have all ‒ What? At first I remembered all the colors ‒ green, red, and so forth. I told myself I had to remember them and tried hard not to forget. But they gradually faded away. All that's left now is darkness. Oshizu, is it always just you and the doctor at home? It is now. I have a brother, but he and my father had a falling out. He ended up leaving. That was five years ago, back in Edo. The doctor seems like such a nice man, but he must have a stubborn streak, too. Can you stay until after the summer festival? I suppose. Master Ichi. Over here. Are you okay? Is the doctor out? He said he'd be back before sundown. - What am I going to do? - Tell me what's wrong, Gosuke? It's about Okiyo. I heard she was laid up in bed, so I went to take her home, but ‒ She's that sick? They wouldn't hear of it. You should never have sent her to work in Matsugoro's mill. What do you want? I heard Matsugoro's weaving mill was a living hell. I came to see what hell is like. Are you looking for trouble? I don't know who put you up to this, but you'll watch your mouth if you know what's good for you. I came all this way. At least let me have a little look. Listen, buddy. You say you want a look, but you don't even have eyes to see. You think that's funny? All right, you can have a look ‒ at some stars! Son of a bitch! You're that ‒ I want you to tell Boss Matsugoro that Zatoichi came by to say hello. Kumeji, it's that blind man! What? Who are you? I've come for revenge. Revenge? One of the men you killed at Nembutsugawara was my blood brother. First they harassed me, taking advantage of my blindness. Then they came at me with drawn swords. Shut up! I don't care how it happened. You're not leaving here alive. I figured it was you, you son of a bitch! Why did you stop me? Don't you value your life? You could never defeat this man face-to-face. Don't do it! He'd be on top of you before that blade even left your hand. Blind dog! I'll come right at you out of the darkness. Don't you forget it! Darkness makes no difference to a blind man. I'm not done with you. So we meet again. Come in. Give me some sake. I hear you're staying with a doctor named Junan. That's right. Have you known him long? I just met him two days ago. He's a good doctor. He treats patients without regard to payment. In all my travels, I've never met anyone like him. You can't measure a man by outward appearances. Since I'm blind, I'm never fooled by appearances. Right. But I'm talking about the deepest reaches of the heart. There are things a person never lets anyone else see. Sounds like maybe you bear some kind of grudge against the doctor. Wouldn't want him to worry about me. I better be going. Pay my bill with yours, will you? Your muscles feel pretty loose tonight. Your muscles feel pretty loose tonight. Thanks to you. You're very good. You shouldn't have to wander backwaters like this for work. Always being on the road means I occasionally get to rub the shoulders of great men like you. You're really laying it on thick tonight. Perhaps a little. Hello. Did you want something? I beg your indulgence. I believe I am in the presence of one Master Zatoichi, and I wish to pay my respects. I am a member of Boss Matsugoro's family, resident in this town ‒ his second in command, Sennosuke by name. It is my great pleasure to make your acquaintance. Boss Matsugoro informs me that some of our young men have treated you rudely. To make amends, the boss would like to offer you a drink, and he has sent me to fetch you. I didn't know you were a yakuza. I understand you people have special codes of decorum. Personally, I hate yakuza. We have a palanquin waiting. Right this way. Right this way. I want to make a stop on the way. MATSUGORO We brought Zatoichi. Come right on in. You needn't be afraid. It was good of you to send a palanquin for me. I'm pleased you came. You should have come here straightaway instead of staying in a civilian household. I had no business that required your hospitality. Don't be that way. Members of the brotherhood are all family. What's with this guy? This is Gosuke. His daughter works as a weaver in your mill. It seemed the perfect chance to let him pay his respects. Express your appreciation to the boss. Thank you for looking after my daughter. So that's the story. Make yourself comfortable. Now, Master Ichi, let me pour you a drink. First, I'd like you to bring Gosuke's daughter here. I don't think I can do that. Why not? It's not so easy to say, but ‒ He made a special trip. Please let him see his daughter. Sennosuke, it's Master Ichi's request. Show this man to the mill. Wait. I asked you to bring the girl here. I also want you to cancel her term of service and return her bond papers to Gosuke. That's what I'd like you to do. Master Ichi, why did you come here? I came because you sent a palanquin for me. I didn't send a palanquin so I could hear about Gosuke. But that's why I came ‒ to talk to you about Gosuke. You've got to be joking. Then you won't do it? It'd set a bad example for the other girls. A bad example like that might actually make the girls happy. What are you saying? I came all this way to see you. I can't go home empty-handed. Very well. Here, have a drink. Thank you. If you're willing to see it my way, then I believe I will. Much obliged. I believe you said you'd bring the girl. Go get her! I'd also like you to get me her bond papers. That blind guy? Uh-huh. He's called Zatoichi. He's got quite a reputation. Come on inside. Stop dragging your feet. She seems to have arrived. Let's go. It's a happy day for you. Damn it! Father! Okiyo! Thank the boss, Gosuke. Thank you very much, sir. So long, Boss. Thanks for the drink. What are you following me for? Did you want something? I hear you're a yakuza who goes by the name of Zatoichi. That smell is familiar. I remember it from during that downpour. At that place where I took shelter. So you knew? You're scary. You're not alone, are you? You don't answer. Wait. A blind man who's a yakuza with a lightning sword ‒ You're quite a puzzle. You think so? Maybe you're the one who's the puzzle. You only get one life. Take care of yourself. I got him! Way to go, Kumeji! Even Zatoichi's helpless against flying blades. You only get one life. Take care of yourselves. Who is it? Don't you recognize me? Brother! Father, it's Brother! You don't have a brother. He disappeared five years ago after killing a man in Edo in a foolish fight. Even if he's still alive, he can't be up to any good. He hasn't changed a bit, has he? Oshizu, how long have you been living here? Three years. How about you? Where do you live now? Nowhere in particular. In that case... Father! Forget it. When I heard there was a doctor here named Junan, I had to come. But I doubt we'll meet again. Brother! Father! You have to stop him! Tell Father you're sorry. I couldn't live grinding out medicines like Father. You haven't changed a bit since you were little. Take good care of the old man. Brother! Is something the matter, Oshizu? Did the doctor scold you? Come, let's go inside. Did something happen here, Doctor? I can't imagine Oshizu doing anything to get scolded. - Master Ichi. - Oshizu. What's wrong, Doctor? Don't ask. It's a family matter. I see. I'm sorry. Master Ichi, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not angry with you. I'm sorry for what I said when I found out you were a yakuza. It's all right, sir. Until now, I've only known you as a masseur. I should have said something. You know, Master Ichi, you're an excellent masseur. Wouldn't you like to put the yakuza life behind you and settle down? Even a country town like this grows on you when you live here. First I tell you to keep your nose out of our family matters, and now I'm sticking my nose where it doesn't belong. At any rate, make yourself at home here as long as you like. Oshizu, didn't someone bring us some pickles? I was waiting for you to get home, Master Ichi ‒ to have some sake with the pickles. Sorry to have made you worry, Master Ichi. It's Matsugoro! Everybody quiet! Who gave you permission to hold a cocoon market? Don't you know what happens when you stand up to Matsugoro? All right, men. Tear the place apart. Stop it! Stop them, Matsugoro! Stop them, I say! I distinctly remember telling you, headman. Starting this year, I control the cocoon market. You may have said that, but I never agreed to it. Whether you agree to it or not, I've spoken to the magistrate. In that case, I'll tell him about this myself, and he can issue a decision. Fine. I'll take up that challenge any day. You try too hard, old man. You should act your age. Okay, we're leaving. Let's get this cleaned up. I want you to kill the headman tonight. Is that the favor you mentioned? Looks like you're getting the better part of this deal. Will you do it? We gave our word. But there is one thing. I know. I'll make sure you have an escape route. Then you can head straight for Hatcho Pass. This better not be a trap. Matsugoro of Omiya wouldn't do a thing like that. Try anything stupid and it'll be your life. Damn, it's raining again. Are you Tokuzaemon? Answer me! Yes. Let's get out of here. Oyone! Kumeiji. How'd this rabble get in here? Out! Out! Get moving! You're still in town? They massacred the entire household. Such hideous cruelty! Think you'll be able to sleep tonight, Boss? I note that these are the very people you've been at odds with. What's that supposed to mean? I'm a deputy of the law. That's right, isn't it? Say, Boss, are you aware there are some suspicious characters hanging around above your mill? That's where the weaver girls stay. Sometimes blind folk see things that sighted folk can't. Master Ichi. There's nothing more a doctor can do here. Let's go. All right. I suggest you watch your step. Blind son of a bitch! He can sniff around all he wants. The killers are long gone. The boss is back. What a pain ‒ making us run all over the place. Those officials are real slave drivers. Boss. They are? Two of you come with me. What's going on? What the hell is this about? Why'd you come back? Listen here, Matsugoro. We almost made it to Inoda, but then there were police all over the place. That can't be. It must be some mistake. - Mistake, you say? - Absolutely. Why should I do anything to ‒ Wait. You've got to believe me. If it was a trap, then why would I have come here? Knowing you, it could be some kind of act. I wouldn't do that. I came to complain about you coming back. All right. We'll believe you. But we'll be staying here a while longer. That could be a problem. After this incident, the authorities will be in and out constantly. Nobody will guess that the killers are at your place. This puts me in a real bind. How about if I immediately prepare a safer location? Would you be willing to move there? What do you think? Please. One false move and it's my head as well as yours. We'll try to get you moved as soon as we can. Thanks. Tama? Here, Tama. I gather that was Matsugoro who just left. What are you going to do to me? - I just want to ask you something. - I'll tell you nothing. Do what you want with me. I take it the men upstairs are the ones who attacked the headman's house. - How should I know? Kill me! No, I'm going to give you a new life. If the tip of this sword had traveled five inches farther, you'd now be dead. It's not too late. Make a new start. What's up, Kumeji? Something wrong? Inside! What happened? It's Zatoichi. Over there! Stay out of this. He's mine. Damn! Where's Zatoichi? - He fell in. - Then ‒ He may or may not be dead. Find him and kill him! Find him yet? No. - How about over there? - No luck. Go on around the other side. - Did you find him? - No. Let us know right away if you see anybody suspicious. Get lost. Sorry to trouble you, but would you have some booze? Doctor! Doctor! Please open up! Doctor! Master Ichi! Matsugoro's men did this to him. Bring him inside. Oshizu, some compresses. He cut the bullet out himself. I suppose he didn't want to trouble me. The idiot. Don't move. Hold him down. Things could get messy if Zatoichi's still alive. That damn troublemaker! I'd like to get you people out of here right away. I have a brewery in Shimogo. My men will show you the way. All right. But let us know as soon as you find out whether he's dead or alive. Of course. He was wounded pretty bad. If he's alive, he's going to need a doctor. Something wrong, Oaki? No. Thanks, Oshizu. How are you feeling? Better, thanks. That's good to hear. It was awfully reckless of you to cut the bullet out yourself. You could easily have made things worse. Father was very angry. I"m sorry to be so much trouble. Don't worry about it. - Boss, we found Zatoichi. - What? Someone took him to Dr. Junan's place last night. Good. This is our chance. We"ll finish him off for good. Go. What do you think you're doing? Turn the place upside down. He's not in the shed either. He's not there? Where's the blind guy? I don't know what you're talking about. We have ways of getting it out of you. You'll both have to come with us. Stubborn old man. Drag him out here. Out! Move it! Come on. - It's terrible! - What? Dr. Junan and Oshizu were taken away by Matsugoro's men. - To where? - The mill. The mill? Stop! Don't tell Master Ichi. Give it up, Doctor. Why should you put yourself through this for some crazy blind guy? I am a physician. Once he has recovered his health, you can do with him as you please. But I can't give him to you before that. Enough of that crap, you old geezer! Please stop! Please don't hit him. Then you tell us where Zatoichi is. Oshizu, you mustn't yield to such lawlessness. Shut up, shithead! Aren't we proud, Doctor? Teach him a lesson! Get out of here! This isn't a show! Since you still refuse to tell me, I'll have to try something different. I suggest you ponder what could happen to your daughter tonight. Take as long as you want. Bring the girl to my house. Father! If he croaks, just throw him in the river. Father! Dad! Uncle Ichi's gone. Oh, no! Chased by the wind The wanderer drifts In his final hour Alone On the lonesome road - He still won't talk? - No. Stubborn old man. Who left the door open? The rain has stopped. Hey, what's up? Doctor? Over here, Master Ichi. Doctor, where's Oshizu? They took her to Matsugoro's house. You can't go like that. I won't let my life go to waste. Master Ichi. No! You mustn't go! Master Ichi. I thought the old geezer was stubborn, but you're stubborn, too. Strip her naked and string her up. - Oshizu. - Master Ichi! It's me. Come on. I'll show you the way. You're going to help us? I died once under your blade. I want to make a new start. So you'll trust me? The doctor's at the mill. Take Oshizu to him. All right. Quick. Boss! It's Zatoichi. - What? The blind bastard doesn't know who he's dealing with. He's probably still hiding around here somewhere. Find him and kill him! Boss! There's no sign of him outside. Damn it! Where could he be hiding? He has to be here somewhere. I came back from hell to get you. They won't let me across the River of the Three Crossings without you. The Lord of Hell is waiting for you. Damn it! Blind son of a bitch! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Are you all right? Don't worry about me. It's Master Ichi I'm worried about. He was badly hurt. Damn it! The bastard's never off his guard. I've got a whole lot of scores to settle with you, and I intend to do it now. Damn! You're not getting away this time. Brother! Brother! Wherever you may fall Who is there to cry In a strange land The cicadas Only the cicadas cry THE END
