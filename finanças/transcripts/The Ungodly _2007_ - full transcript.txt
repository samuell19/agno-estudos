â™ª [siren wailing] [distant barking] [thump] [woman screams] No! [groaning] [woman groans] [man] Don't fucking leave me. [groans] Don't fucking. Don't-- [thump] Did you take the cross off that's been up since you were a kid? Put up this sick shit? Go away, Ma. Don't "go away" me. This is my house. Gino's on the phone. Gimme that. You got me worried. You're running the streets all hours again. I'm not--It's not what you think, Ma. Come sit downstairs with me and watch TV. I don't watch TV. Since when? I'm a film maker, Ma. Oh, is that what they call the unemployed these days? Thank you. A film maker. I'll be downstairs making some tea. It was him. What? I followed him for hours. You sure? Gino, listen. I filmed him kill somebody. I--I gotta see the tapes. You gotta make copies. Christ, Mick, what are you gonna do? Mick, what are you gonna do? Meet him. Thanks for coming. Uh, and I know you're probably wondering.. what I want. Can I have a cigarette. Oh, I-- Yeah, sure. Um, I only have lights. I know you-- I know you only smoke reds. So, what do you want from me? I'm a film maker. I wanna do this, uh, documentary about, about you. About what you do. How'd you find me? I mean, you're gonna do what with me? A documentary. And if I don't agree? I'll send the tape to the Police. But if you do, I won't release it. You know, until or if you're caught. Look. Children. Digging holes. Fathers watching their children. But who watches the mothers? Do you, um, do you like children? I like mothers better. So, why should I believe you? I wanna do this documentary. Serial killers, you know, when they're caught the media, you know, they portray them as-- [muffled voices] monsters, animals. I wanna show that, you know, you're human, and, you know, show your thoughts, and you have feelings. And, um, I wanna preserve you. What if I decide my next victim is you? I don't fit your profile. Hm. That little red light means it's capturing me? Yeah. Means it's recording. You brought a book. What is it? Blake, huh? You read a lot of philosophy? Well, you don't, Mickey? Mick. Please, not Mickey. Mick. It actually was one of my majors. Hm, what college? You have any favorites? Philosophers? You didn't bring me here to talk philosophy. How old were you when you started? Started what? Six. Six? Can you, uh, tell me about it? You never tortured an animal? Me? No. But you read philosophy. I don't see the connection. Hm. What kind of animal was it? Why don't you take a guess, Mick? A dog. No. A cat. Very good. How? I stoned it to death. When I got older, I nailed them to trees. You like hearing about tortures, don't you? No. Yeah, you do. No. So, it gave you a sense of power. Yeah, like you behind that camera with the little red light, in a safe hotel room with the door open. You know, what do you want? You want to hear a lot of gruesome stories? Is that what you want? I can read about those in the newspaper. They don't print everything believe me. What's with the eyes? You take your victim's eyes out. It's your signature. They're your trophies, aren't they? Where do you keep them? You know what? I have to go. It's time for me to feed my cats. He's a sick motherfucker. Nobody's ever done what I'm doing, Gino. Yeah. You know why? Because it's fucking illegal. You're in over your head. You're lucky you've still got a head! Now you're acting like an accomplice. To what? >> To what?! Yeah, Read me the law. How about accomplice after the fact, to the murder you caught on tape? Gino, chill out man. I'm gonna turn his ass in in a couple of days, okay? He could be out there hacking people up as we speak. I've got the tape and he knows it. And he slipped up and he knows that too because I tracked him down. This documentary is gonna launch our careers, man. You have some better plan to get out of this shit life? How many days before you turn him in? Why are you locking the door? I always lock my door. But you are what people are afraid could get in. [meow] No, baby, no, no, no, no. Come with daddy. I know. Look what I got for her. Cats, huh? Just poured some juice. You care for some? No, I'm allergic. What's the baby jars for? You allergic to juice? Cats. My eyes water and my throat is sore. Oh, uh, Joey, say hi to Mickey. Hiya, Mickey. You've been working almost a half hour. You gotta make a decision. [door buzzer] Mommy's here. I wanna stay here. It's okay, it's okay. Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna leave this board exactly the way it is, alright? I think somebody wants an express ride down them stairs! [imitates engine] Say goodbye to Mickey. Goodbye, Mickey. [wood creaks] Hey. So, who was that? It's just some kid I help out at the hospital once in a while. It's just rest in peace bullshit. An urn. That's an urn? Better be. My mother's ashes are in there. Your mother? Well, shall we begin? Okay, one second. All right. How do you choose which ones? It's a-- A special glow they have. It's as if they choose me. What do you mean? [shouts] What do I do with the bodies? You're askin' me to pull my pants down, Mick. I don't think that's gonna happen. Not tonight. Conscience is a sickbed. Under its filthy sheets lie all of our fears. It's not conscience that prevents men from killing and raping. It's the consequence. Fear of death, jails, God. But really where is he? Does he hear his name when they're screaming? Do they return to him piece by piece when I finish with them? The moment that God strikes me down, I'll smile because I'll believe in him for the first time. [woman on TV] Is there a surprise for me? What are you doing? Come on to the back. What're you gonna do in there? Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Shh. Hey, hey. Listen, listen! Listen. You don't touch anybody, you don't hurt anybody while I'm around, You understand me? Shit. [whispers] She just got done cooking breakfast. Remember to put your camera on or you'll miss some good stuff. Get over here. Get the fuck over here. What the fuck are you doing? [shouting] [woman] You asshole! Jesus Christ. Who the hell are you? That's Mickey. Oh, hi, Mickey. Mick. Meet my big sister Megan. What's with the camera? He's doing a movie on me. On you? Why? He's capturing all my transgressions. With your heart it's a wonder you ain't been canonized a saint by now. It's the kids, ain't it? It's the charity stuff. This is Jimmy with the cancer kids. Jimmy playing Santa. Oh, God. It's Melissa. I remember the poor thing could hardly walk. This was the last photo of her. God bless you, Melissa. That reminds me. I need to get some childhood photos of you. Here. This is cute. Jimmy's graduation. The Jersey shore. Why is this woman's face cut out? I, um, I wanna show you something. Come on. It all-- It all started here. Hang on, Let me focus. Look. I thought I would die and no one would know what she did to me. The hours I spent strapped to these pipes. My God. If these walls could talk, they'd cry. Oh. What you got there? [whispers] The proof that I was alive. Jim. [jumbled voices] [kid's voice] I was here. If someone does find this, will you please, please remember me? Do you remember when I asked you if you could stop killing? And you said that if the seeds, that were.. that were buried in darkness-- Were never planted, that I might be able to recapture the innocence I never had. I wondered. Who planted those seeds? She took you down and left you there, huh? Who? Who told you that? Did you take me down to that cell to justify what you do? Not everything is for your fucking benefit, Mick. Right. You know, it just seems that-- Seems like what? What? What, do you think I'm killing my mother? Yeah, it's obvious. I mean, in your mind you think you are, but in reality you're killing the innocent. Do me a favor, all right? Remove those eight women from the equation, what do you got? Wait, how do you remove eight women lying in pools of their own blood with their eyes taken out? Am I beneath compassion? What? What compassion did you have? I'm just asking. Just try to remove them from the equation. [shouts] It's not an equation. It's life! It's body identifications. It's funerals. It's families torn apart! It's moms takin' sleeping pills and praying to God that when they wake up their daughters are still alive! You know what's confusing you? You see parts of me in yourself, and that makes me human. You're fucking nuts. No, I'm not nuts! But you also see yourself in me, the potential we all have. Potential? Potential is not action. Action is what defines us. You gotta ask yourself one question. You gotta ask yourself if you still want to find the human behind the monster. Because if you don't, this whole documentary is a waste. Come on. Are you hungry? Yeah. I haven't had an appetite since I met you. Do you like pepperoni? Oh, yeah, only the cheese. Coffee? Thank you! Jennifer. Are you Polish? No. You? Yeah, a half. I remember in the holidays when I was a kid we would have huge pots of kabasi and sauerkraut. This place has the best kebasi. No way. No, my mom's butcher, Mr. Tomaszewski hands down the best. Tomaszewski's? Yeah. Two blocks from my house. Every Tuesday they got these specials and my Ma, she's always-- Anyway, they are the best. So. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Beautiful eyes. Huh? Her eyes. She's got a perfect shade of blue that puts the sky to shame. My name is Bob and I'm a, uh, an alcoholic addict. I'm coming up on 30 days, and, um-- [applause] But it ain't easy. And for days now I've just been obsessed, sweating, and, uh, I feel like I'm going out, but, uh, at least I'm still here. I slipped last night. As many of you know, I've been wrestling with it for days. I still have her blood underneath my fingernails. I was hanging out later than I should. That look in your eyes as I'm slowly pushing the blades into their stomach. My sponsor tells me, "Don't beat yourself up about it. Just don't do it today." My name is Arnold. I'm a serial killer. I have one day back. Damn it. I cut off part of Frank's hand. [Mick] Hey, hey you see the footage I dropped off? Yeah. Did I tell you? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, the cellar. Sinatra had such eyes. Beautiful eyes. This man today, he told me I had pretty eyes. You think I got nice eyes? I, I got lots of ideas. Yeah, coming right over. What do you think so far? Yeah. Oh, that looks nice, Ma. Shit. I need some more glue. Who was the guy? I've never seen him before. He was such a sweetheart. What'd he look like? Tall. I think he was tall. And he specifically complimented you on your eyes? Complimented me? [giggles] He took my picture. Said he'd send me a copy. Ma, Ma, you didn't give this guy our address, did you? Well, it might be a nice picture. [shouts] Ma, how could you do that?! How could you give a complete stranger our fucking address? I don't know! Anyway, It's not our address. It's my address! Holy fuck! You're drinking again, ain't you? That's why you never stay home with me. I smell it. Mothers know. Why don't you go to a meeting? You'll feel better. I just came from a meeting. You keep all these windows and doors locked. You understand me?! All of them locked! [Police radio transmissions] Hey, I need to see a detective right now. Sign down here. No. I don't have time for this bureaucratic bullshit. Have a seat over there and I'll see what I can do for you. You're hurting my wrist. Stop it! [cell phone rings] I know it was you. Whoa, whoa. What was me? You approached my mother. I did? Yeah, yeah. You motherfucker! Mickey, calm down. Just tell me what happened? You know what happened. What did this guy look like? It looked like you! Me? What do I look like? Yeah, you, you. You look like you. You have brownish hair and tall. I'm tall? No. Guess it wasn't me then. No, I mean-- You're not tall to me, but to my mother you're-- Is your mother real short or something? No, no, no. Ma's not short. Listen, you sick fuck! I'm calling the shots here you understand? I still got those tapes! Oh, so you do. Guess what I got? [man] You wanna see a detective? Ma. Ma! Ma. Ma! [panting] What did I do? What did I do? [horn honking] [horn honking] Where is she? Get in the car, Mickey Mouse. You can fuck with me but you cannot fuck with what I love! What? You don't love yourself? Where's my Ma? Come on. [siren wails] Oh, yeah, you're gonna cry now! You say anything, your mother dies. She fucking dies! Is there a problem? Yeah, this fucking cock sucker. Calm down. Use your head, Mick. Is this any way to treat someone who cares about you, who loves you? I'm talking about your poor Mom. She's worried sick about you right now! You know what? In about one minute I'm gonna throw the godamn cuffs on you! On me? Let me tell you something officer! He, he-- I'm waiting. My brother's off his meds, officer. I ain't on no fucking meds. Hey! Let go. Get off now! Put your hands apart. Get 'em up. Get over here. You got any weapons on you? No. Any drugs? No drugs? No. What the fuck's wrong with you? I gotta tell you something. You know what, you can tell me down at the station, alright? You stay right there! Fuck, no. No, no! [shouts] Hey! Sir, listen. Officer, listen. My brother is all messed up.. Please, let me just explain you something. Explain what? Kid is mouthing off to me. He's gone nuts. So what am I supposed to do? He just got out of the hospital a couple of days ago. Is that my problem? No, it's not. Just let me take him home, please. I'll take him home. You know, give him his meds. If we have to, we'll take him to the hopsital. I'm sorry about this. Stay here. Don't move. All right. You must be grateful you got someone looking after you. I hope you don't mind, but I thought I'd grab at why I took Mom. [whispers] Please. Tell me. Tell me you didn't-- That you, that you didn't kill her. Do you think I killed your mom? Don't do this to me. How does it feel, Mick, to be a subject? What do I have to do? What do you think you have to do? I don't know. What do you have that I want? I don't know. What brought us together? The tape. And all the other copies, of course. No. No? No. Did you ever hear your mother scream, Mick? [cries] Oh, that's good. Emotion sells. Oh, I guess no introductions are necessary. Are you out of your mind? He's got my mom. He's got your-- [Gino] Why is he here? Get him the fuck out of here! You weren't supposed to-- I know, I know. I wasn't supposed to-- Fuck you, Gino. He kidnapped my Mom! Fuck you. Fuck, fuck you. Fuck you. >> He's got my mom! Gino what's this? Come here. Is that a movie? Uh, it's his, his documentary. The one before. Before? Before what? Before my movie? I mean, it's, um-- Mickey tells me you're a good editor. [girl] I was up to about four or five bags of heroin a day. He told me I was blue. And I felt-- I felt like I was floating up on the ceiling. Just-- Just looking down on my lifeless body. In my soul, I truly believe my soul left my body. You know what? I wasn't even scared. Just looking down on my body all sprawled out, it was sort of beautiful. [Mick grunts] Oh, no, no, no! Come on! Please, please!! [cries] Take it easy. Come on. Take it easy. [cries] C'mon, we gotta go. [cries] Did you kill my mom? Did you kill my mom? You killed my mom? [whines and cries] Did you kill my-- [cries] You-- [stammers] Hi, it's me. Put her on. What do you mean who? The old lady. I'll wait. Hold on, sweetheart. hold on, hold on. Ma. [nervous voice] Mom! How did-- What did they do to you? Are you okay? Give me! That's as close as you get for now. [coughs] [sobbing] No. Nine months sobriety. It's a long time away from someone you love. Do you still feel like using? No, no, no, no, no. I didn't kill these people. Oh, these are miscellaneous. Killing alone. A loner psycho. How much time you waste on that one? What the fuck is this? "Victims. Ruth James, Consuela Roman. Perhaps following the Bible." Oh, I-- okay. These last names are from the New Testament. You gotta be fucking kidding me. You have hear of coincidence, Mick? [laughs] This is mine. These are my cigarette butts. Where did you get this? This is my coffee receipt? Where did you get this? You left it in the garbage. What garbage? This documentary is over. Where did you get this? It's over. You understand me?! I'm finished! [shouts] Stop it! I can't fucking take it anymore! Where did you get this? Oh, God. In the park. What park? Which one? Across the street from where you killed your seventh victim you sick fuck. Oh, that's brilliant. It's because of all the butts in the cup. You knew I'd spend the night watching her through a window waiting to get in. But how did you know which last drop the receipt came from? I mean, there's a bunch? 'Cause bastards like you, usually kill their first victim in their own fucking neighborhood, where they're comfortable. So, you went to the last drop, nearest to the first victim. That's the one. And then what? Then I matched the time on the receipt to the time on the surveillance tape. They got surveillance cameras in coffee shops now? They do when they've been robbed twice. And then you staked the place out for me. You-- You are a genius, Mick. [whispers] Let go of me. You're helping me! I gotta be more careful. I gotta change my patterns. [Megan] A happy memory from Jimmy's childhood? Well. [Mick] Megan. Can I, uh, have one of those? One? Two. Two. I got this, um-- Three, actually. So, um, where is she now? Your mother. Dead. Was almost a year before Jimmy stopped screaming in his sleep. When did she die? 19, 1990. July. Jimmy was-- Was? Finally free. She had to die for him to be. What did she die of? What do you mean? She died. She just died. People die. She had an infection. Influenza. A sort of-- Three weeks in Philadelphia Memorial. Then one day she just stopped breathing. Ca-can we stop right now? 'Cause I know a migraine is coming when I start seeing white.. white light. Tell me about the cellar. [Little Jimmy shouting] No, no! [screams, cries] You know, the walls. The old bricks. They're filled with his neatly folded screams. [Little Jimmy] She's calling me again. She says this time [inaudible] I wanted to stay in it. I see the light. Dear God, please, help my Mommy. [jumbled voices] The dirt lives inside of me. She says she would leave me forever. The angels live in clouds. I didn't mean to touch it. [jumbled voices and screams] [Little Jimmy crying] [mother shouting] Stop it. Stop it! [Little Jimmy crying and shouting] [mixed voices] He left this note for you. [woman] Who is it? Um, it's, um, Mick Gravatski. Who? Oh, I'm sorry. Um-- Are you the girl, I'm sorry, the wo-- Are you a waitress? Yeah. What do you want? Did you serve me the other night at the diner? Yeah, so? [girl groans] [smacking and groaning] Put these on. Put the gloves on! And get the camera. Now! [groans] [shouts] No, no, no! Film. [shouting] No, no! Help! Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming! Battery's dead. My battery's dead. Replace it. My battery's dead. You carry two batteries. Replace it. [sobs] I can't--wait, Don't do--se. Don't let me see you kill her, okay? We can hear about it. Jesus Christ. Okay, look. I can't, I can't use any of this-- Listen to me. Listen, I'm going to remove the gag. You look at me, you scream, I pluck out your eyes. Jimmy. Jimmy, please. Do your fucking job! You could've turned me in the first day you found out who I was. You could've taken that tape to the Police. And if you did, none of this would be happening. Please! Please! Jimmy, stop man. Jimmy, look. man. Do not fucking look at me. Do not! [all shout] No, Jimmy! [all shout] Jimmy, no! No, Jimmy! No. [shouts] No, look what you fucking did! No, no. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Please, don't die yet. Not yet! Please. Please, please. Please, don't fucking die yet. Please. Please! Oh, oh! [pants] [pants] [Mick] Damn! What the--? That's it?! Fuck you. Ma? Ma, you think I'm having fun? There you go, kiddo. Cute kid. A few more years she'll be just my type. Look, your camera it's inside. I took it. Fucking charity bullshit. Humanity. You see, power, real power is giving life and taking it away. You, uh, you hug a crippled kid at his birthday party, and then you cut people's eyes out. You put them in baby jars.. Fucking bullshit. Are you coming to my daughter's birthday party in a few days, Mickey? Carolyn is turning 13. Oh, look at this. Here she is as a baby. Only nine months. Look how pretty she was. Oh, and here is a baptism picture. There's Jimmy. He was the godfather. Who's the woman? It's Ma. Your mother? Jimmy's mother? Oh. She had an infection. Influenza. A sort of-- Three weeks in Philadelphia Memorial. One day she just died. Ca-can we stop right now? Jimmy was finally free. She had to die for him to be. I got you. I fucking got you. I need to film you again. Just some follow-up questions. Can't it wait unt-- Sit down. Your mother. You said she died in 1990, right? July. Right. Your daughter, she's having her thirteenth birthday? So she was born in '92. Yeah, she's-- Yeah, but your mother, she was in her baptism photo. So, how could she be dead in 1990 and alive in 1992? That. I was confused. That-- You said she died of an emphysema? Yeah. Emphysema. 1993. Now I remember. Don't you mean influenza? That's what you told me the first time. I don't know what this has to do with Jimmy's charity. Where's she buried? Please, Mickey, I'm seeing a white light-- [yells] Sit down! [woman screams] Don't you fucking lie to me! I'm sorry. Where is she buried? Potter's field. We just didn't have enough money-- That's real fucking convenient! Is there a headstone? No. Where is the grave? What's the grave number? I--I don't know. You don't know. You don't know! How can she be buried when Jimmy has her fucking ashes on the shelf? Does he? Does he have the ashes on the shelf? Where's the death certificate? She is dead. Why are you doing this to me? I just can't remember details. I swear on my eyes. Be careful where you swear it in. [Jimmy] He's got a hell of an arm, Mick. What the hell happened? Oh, nothing, nothing. I just got upset. What'd you to do her? I'm just doing my job, Jimmy. [woman] You want '90? These records only go back to '94. Really? Um, do you think you could run her name for me? Well, it ain't gonna do no good if she was here in '90. I know. It just means so much to me to find by biological mother. Emma Lemac. Well. Only cause you have an honest face. Thank you. Um, 2001, May. Re-admitted for two months. But that was in psychiatric. Psychiatric? Mm-hm. But there was a social worker assigned to the case. Really? Who? [violin solo] You hear that? What? What? What are you hearing? If you'd like to leave your number Mr-- Gravatski. I'll pass it along. That way Mrs. Lemac, if she is your biological mother, can decide whether she wants to contact you. Do you keep her psychiatric file in this office? Is there something I could look at? That's inappropriate, Mr-- Still Gravatski. Leave your number if you like. Thanks for your lack of help. [alarm beeps] [cell phone rings] Jimmy. Hey, yeah. I can't talk right now. Sure. Uh, yeah, just tell me what time. Okay, yes. I wo-- I won't be late. Makes them think they're dead you old bitch. [violin solo] I ain't surprised you're investigatin' that social worker. I knew she wasn't right by her eyes. What the fuck are you doing? She was very inappropriate with me. She wasn't listening to nothin' I was sayin'. I found her. I found your mother. What? Who the hell is this? Whose ashes are these? Not hers. Your games are gonna kill you. Do you know what I'm capable of? People. These people that come. They don't care, about nobody. [coughs] You'll let me get rid of her? The girl. I'll just take care of it. She was touching your boy you said, huh? But I wonder what they did to deserve it. Who the fuck is this, Meg? Are there even ashes in here Meg? Are there even ashes? >> No! No! Stop! You knew she was alive. You knew she was alive. You knew it. [sobs] I did it for you, Jimmy. What, lie to me? I did it so you could move on! How the fuck have I moved on? Don't hurt her. Get off of me! Get the fuck off me! No! Have I ever hurt anybody in this house? Ever? Why? Why did you have to do this? Why did you have to tell him? Oh, God. Jimmy, Jimmy. I swear. I swear I was just trying to protect you. You tried to protect me all this time? All this time this woman was alive! She was breathing in the same fucking city! You. You motherfucker! Take me to her. Take me now! You give me my Ma. And I'll give you yours. The attic. What? Ma! Ma? Ma. Ma. Ma. It's me. Ma, it's Mickey. What did you do to her? Give me. I'm gonna give her a lethal dose if you don't take me where I gotta go! I'm not leaving without my mom. She's okay. She's alive. She's not okay. She's a fucking zombie. Mom, c'mon, we're gonna go home. Let's go. I just wanna take my mom. Listen to me, you-- Carolyn knows exactly what to give her. And she knows exactly what not to give her. Unless I call and tell her otherwise. You fulfill your end of the bargain, and you get her back. [heavy metal music] Go straight. [inaudible] Don't jerk the wheel. Fingernails. Don't jerk the fuckin' wheel. Fuck, Fuck! You wanna stay out of my fucking business? Go to the right. Make a right. Oh, fuck. How could you? You fucking junkie! Yeah, you're a real contribution to society yourself. Where is it? Right...there. There. Which one? This one, that one? Which one, you junkie fuck? 21 Polito. Is she really in there? C'mon, go ahead knock. This is the door. Knock. I just did. Harder. Keep it up, you fuck. Okay, okay. I thought you said she was here. She was. If this is a fucking set up, I swear to fuck-- It's not my fault if she drags ass to the fucking store. What you want? It ain't her. Who are you? Is Emma Lemac here? You haven't heard? Poor thing. The ambulance took her off to the hospital. She ain't dead, is she? What? Is she dead? Sorry, my hearing. Is she dead? No, thank God. Which hospital? Hospital. Which one. Saint Mary's. Or was it Saint John's? I get my saints mixed up. Saint Mary's. Yeah. Thank you. [tires screech] [woman] Can I help you? Sir? We're looking for the room number of, of Emma Lemac. Uh. 6030. It's the elevator that way. [elevator bell] [elevator bell] [bell] [beep from monitor] This is it. Jimmy. Is that really you? All grown up. Come closer. Closer. I thought about you all these years. I dream of seeing you. What did you come here for? Jim, what the fuck are you doing, that's just the oxygen. [coughs] Finally found your courage. When I'm an old lady on my deathbed you come to judge me? How dare you? I brought you in to this world. I'm gonna take you out. Here. Doing me a favor. [coughs] Do it! Kill me. Be a man. Be a man for once in your goddamn life! [coughs] Jimmy. C'mon, Jimmy, do this or let's get the fuck outta here. C'mon, we gotta get get out of here. We gotta get out of here now. You, you do it. What? Kill her. I can't. No, let's go. You leave this room, I call Carolyn. Your mother'll be dead. She'll be cold by the time you get there. This is never gonna end. It's just gonna keep going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. I'll call the police. I'll turn myself in to the police. I'll do anything you want. I just need to see her die. Jimmy, you're worthless. Even for this. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Listen, you old bitch. I know what you are, you understand me? [Jimmy] Do it! No! Go ahead, boy. Jimmy ain't got the guts! Jesus Christ. Please, just do it. Please. Just kill her. [chuckles] Cry, boy. I always loved to hear you cry. [mocking] Please. Please. Please. Please. Please! [fast beeping] [shouts] No! [normal beeping] [continuous beep] [alarm goes off] [over loudspeaker] Call code. Sixth floor. 6030. [Mick] Can you stop? Are you asking me if I can be cured? A cure is inconceivable to them because the crimes are too unforgivable. They simply want people like us dead. But death doesn't end evil. Merely sets it free. Are you evil? If I choose to take responsiblity for what I've done. Do you? Do you? [heavy rock music]
