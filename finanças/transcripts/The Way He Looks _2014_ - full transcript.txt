What's your level of Laziness right now? Hmm... What about you? And a half And a half?! That much!? Ah... This sun, these holidays, this pool... It makes me feel lazy to think that this will all end Ah, I'm lazy because of doing nothing... I'm very happy doing nothing... No... We never do anything on holidays. Nothing happens. And what do you want to happen? I don't know... But the great dramas, the great romances On our holidays, they never happen... And with whom do you imagine your "Great romance"? You're the one always saying that our classroom is full of frogs. Well, it doesn't have to be a prince. And you. Don't you care about that? With what? What? Are you going to go through your whole life without kissing anyone? Giovanna! Well, it's the truth. Sleeping and listening to Beethoven during the Holidays you won't solve that... You should kiss any girl, just to get it out of the way. If I should just kiss any girl, then why don't I kiss you, then? But I don't want my first kiss to be like that Ugh, Leo. You're never going to kiss anybody. Who would want to kiss me? I bet that that Witch, Karina, would... But it's very likely that you'll become a frog. Dummy. That one is always watching you. But it's depressing to know that the only person that would hook up with me, is Karina. And she only talks shit, you know? So boring... What if we hooked up and she glues to me? Do you think she's that type? Gi? Giovanna... Hey. Did you say something? Weren't you listening to me? No... Get in the water, Leonardo. Stop being so boring. Nobody says I'm boring! Are you sure you don't want to come in, gi? Nah, I still have to get my school things ready. Give me your keys, Leo. Here. -See you tomorrow. -Bye. Mom? I'm home. Hi, Leo. Lunch is ready. I'll be right there. Hey, Leo. How was your day? -Okay. -Just Okay? Nah. It was cool. You look really burned. Did you use sunscreen? Yes, I did, mom. It was just really sunny. Are you sure? Aw, mom... You know I don't like sunscreen. It get's all sticky on your skin... Seriously. I prefer to not sunbathe. Good. Cause that's what's going to happen the next time. Relax, mom... Yeah, relax... Did you get your things ready? No. I was waiting for the laziness to go away. But now I'm gonna have to do it feeling lazy. -Hey Little lion. -Hey, Dad. You are burned. Where were you? At Gi's. You know? The other day I met Gi and I was startled. Why? Gi's all grown up all. Became a woman. What do you mean, dad? Just the other day the two of you were just kids... And now you're getting old. Becoming decent people. Chair, Leo. Dad, seriously... I must have super powers. I've been doing this for so long and I never fell. You're so funny... Leo, I talked to your Grandma And on this wednesday she has a doctor's appointment so I thought... That's okay. I can come here. And you're gonna be here alone? Why? Can't I? Leo, What are you going to eat? I don't know. I eat at school, make a sandwich. I don't know... No. I'd be worried. Mom... What's so tragic that can happen? Okay, then... -But, Leo. Call us as soon as you get home -Okay And make sure your phone is charged. Okay, mom. Up. Can I know what's the joke, Mr. Guilherme? Nothing, teacher. I'm sorry guys, but that duo is not going to work for another year. Fabio, please, sit behind Leo. -Aw, No, prof. -Aw, yes, Fabio. You know we can't sit behind Leo. That close to this infernal "tec-tec" all day long... You're a real asshole aren't you,you idiot? Take care of your things, human-cane. Fabio, you're such a dick. I'll show you what's a dick later...Seeing eye-dog. Shut up, you idiot! What is this, people?! Where do you think you are? Prof... If I sit on that chair behind Leo, I'm going to have to help him all day. Shit, he can't do anything on his own. That's enough, Fábio. You won't have to help anyone at the principal's office. Get your things. Wow prof... That's low. What about Giovanna? Is she not going to the Principal's office? What about you? Wanna be his 'plus one' there? No, Thanks. Fábio... Is this the 211? Yes, it's here. What's your name? Gabriel. You can come in. Can I sit on that empty chair? People... Yes, you can go. Welcome, Gabriel. Any more funny jokes? Huh? NOPE. The keys, Leo. Bye, Gi. Bye. Don't let that idiot, Fábio, Ruin your day, okay? Okay. I'm gonna tell you something. The new kid is very cute. Who knows? Maybe this year things get better. Looks like it. Maybe he's my enchanted prince. Don't overdo it, Giovanna. He's just in. You barely know him. Are you jealous, Leo? Yes, Giovanna. I'm dying of jealousy. Unbelievable. What the hell... -What? -Karina is always hitting on everyone What are you talking about, Gi? She just sat next to Gabriel and is already hitting on him. It's not enough to hit on you. A new guy comes and she's already going for it. Okay. Cells can be split in two basic types... Can I borrow an eraser? I don't use erasers... -Sorry... -Nah, It's cool. Ah, Hang on... Thanks. You're welcome. If I were pluto and someone told me... "Hey, You're not a planet anymore!" I'd be really mad. Seriously. Keys, Leo. Bye. Bye, Leo. Bye, Gabriel. Well... Bye to you too, then. You don't keep going down? No, I live two block back. I just always bring Leo to his place. Well. See you tomorrow, then. Yes mom. Safe and sound in my room. Okay mom. I will have lunch, Have you ever though about studying abroad, Gi? What do you mean? Exchange... Live outside... Not me. Laziness... Why? I was thinking about that. I don't know... Move to the USA. Ah, not the US, Leo. France is really cool. Can you imagine? Vacationing in Paris. But I'm not talking about vacations... And... US, France... Wherever... it's fine... I just want to leave... But why that now, Leo? It's not the first time I think about that. It's been awhile. Just imagine how cool it would be to go somewhere and no one knows you No one knows who you are You can invent a new personality if you want to. What? You don't like your personality? I do. But I am not a problem. Excuse me Are you going to stay for dinner Yes I will -When it's ready I'll call you guys -Okay, Thanks. What about your mom What about her? What does she think about that? Obviously, she doesn't know. And you intended to move to another country with telling your parents, Leo? Who knows? You're crazy, Leo. Where's yours? At home. At home? Let's go? Let's go. I'm not going with you today. I'm having lunch at my grandma's. Ah, today's wednesday! I'm sorry, I'm taking Leo to his Grandma's house. No, Gi. You don't have to. I can go alone. It's right there, I can take you. Yeah, It's right there. I can go alone. Are you sure, Leo? Yes. Okay, Your choice. Well, guys. We'll talk later, okay? Okay. -Call me, Okay? -Okay. Hey, mom. Yes, I'm here at school. Yes, I'm going to grandma's. As soon as I get there I... I will, mom... Kisses. Leo. Are you okay? Leave... Leo, are you okay? Yes. -Are you sure? I can take you to the nurse... -I'm fine, Karina. You guys are fucks, huh? Hello? Hey, mom. No, non. Nothing yet. You sure he didn't say where he was going to? Giovanna doesn't know either. It's better that you stay there. He could go to your house and not find anyone. I think It's better that way. I'll hang up now. Maybe he calls... She doesn't know anything... Leonardo! Wow, mom... what? Where were you, Leo? -Around... -Around?! You didn't think about calling your mom telling her you wouldn't come home? -Mom, chill.. -Leo, do you know what time it is? You, out there, at night, in the dark... It's always dark for me, okay? No need for all this neurosis. -Why didn't you pick up your phone? -Mom, I'm sorry. Okay? It was in the backpack. I think I'm old enough to not have to tell you about everything I do. Leonardo, you're still gonna have to tell us a lot of things.. Shit, dad. You too? -Can't I take one step without you watching me? -Oh, watching you? You disappear for one hour and we should be calm? Mom, ask anyone from my class if their parents would be so mad over a little thing like this. -Leo, You know it's different. -Why does it have to be different, mom?! Why don't you try to make it the same?! -Leonardo, your grandma said you got hurt... -It was nothing, mom. It was just a scratch. Can I take a shower? You want to give me a shower now? -Leo -Let him go, Laura... Hi kids. How can I help? So... I wanted to study abroad. So I wanted some information. So, I need your parents to come here. And then we have a chat And then we explain how everything works. -Okay. Thanks -You're welcome. But Ma'am... just so that we don't waste our time here. Can't you just give us an idea of what you need? Okay. You want to study abroad as well? Could be... Okay. Just a minute. Here it is -Thanks -You're welcome. So, we'll be back later with our parents, okay? -Okay, that's great. Just one more question... Do you think it would be a problem for me to study abroad? Being blind... Look. I'll be honest. I never a blind person that wanted to do an exchange. But I think it's all a matter of finding a family that's ready to receive you. Let's do this... Give me your phone number... I'll do some research and I'll call you. -Okay. -Okay? What's your number? It's 9483709 Well... That's it guys. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome Anything else? Dessert? -Want some coffee? -No. Thanks ma. Ma? How old was my mom when I was born? 22... no... 23 Got married soon... And you were born soon after. -Did she date anyone before my dad? -No, he was her first boyfriend. She did so many things with your dad. Your grandpa would get crazy with her. -But she only left her house after she got married... -Oh, yeah. Why? Was thinking about that the other day... -Thinking about having kids? -No... I want to leave my house... How would you sustain yourself? I'll get a job... Everybody works. There's a dude at school that is a waiter at his dad's restaurant. Isn't it a little early for that, Leo? Okay... kisses. Who was it? Girlfriend? My dad... -Your parents are worried? Like Leo's? -Hey... It's actually just my dad. My mom died when I was a child. Is it just the two of you? I have an older brother. He lives with you two? No. He stayed in the city I lived. But you two are okay? -Kind of... -Why 'Kind of'? We're very different, you know? He's an engineer, only thinks in numbers. I love reading, he hates it. At least for music, we're the same. Did you know Leo only listens to classical? Really? Yeah. I always wanted to learn classical music, but I never had the patience. How come? It's the best type of music there is. -Don't exaggerate -But guys, it really is, isn't it? Why do you like it so much? Because of my Grandma Maria. Since I was a child she would tell me. To understand anything, you must begin with the classic. The problem is Leo started with the classical and got stuck there. Dummy... -You can give me some lessons later, then. -Okay. That's all I needed. Beethoven and Mozart Together. -Guys, it's getting quite late. I have to go -Already? Yeah, I have to go as well. Okay... so wait for me to go and change to take you, Leo. If you want to, I can take Leo. Then you don't have to go and come back. No, it's right over there. My house is on Gabriel's way anyway. Makes thing easier. Much easier. Your choice. Well, Let's go. It's about an hour and a half from São Paulo It's not far, then. An hour and a half is relatively close. Sorry... -I forgot about the step. -Relax, no problem. -You warn me about the next one. -I'm sorry. Well, people. Since we're talking about greece I want you to make a project. It's a project for pairs. But the pairs have to be between boys, or girls. Girls will talk about Athene, and the boys, Sparta. Find your pairs, I want the names. Can we have a pair of three? Can I do it with you? ( THAT'S MY FRIEND) Yeah. Have you seen that video of a cat...? The cat gets inside the toilet and... Sorry... That's fine... Do people ask you stupid things like this? Sometimes... Have you always been like this, Leo? Always... I was born like this. So you never saw Giovanna's face? No... Never.. Wow... I'm too lazy to do this project... Tell me about it. We should go to the movie theater. Movie Theater? I'm sorry, Leo. I swear I'll get used to it. What? The giant robot just destroyed the church. What now? Now he has the bride and the groom, one on each hand. What? He just crushed the Groom. But is he dead? I think so... The bride just threw her bouquet on his face. -Bye, Gabriel -Bye, Leo. So... are you never talking to us again? Leo... Me? Leonardo, you know you should have warned us. You know you overreacted? -We were worried, Little Lion -You guys are always worried. I bet that if there was a school camp you wouldn't let me go. -What do you mean? -What Camp? There's going to be a camp, and I've been afraid to ask you to sign it cause I'm sure you'll complain. I just have to call the school to ask about it. See? Everything here is a huge drama. Son, it's a camp. We can't just let you go without knowing... Dad, it's not just the camp... okay? It's not being able to stay home alone. Having to tell you about every step I take. Haven't we agreed that you can stay home alone? Still... do you know how embarrassing it is to be treated like this? -If you call the school, everyone will know. -And what do you suggest? That you authorize it and that's it. Sorry, Leo, but it can't be like that... So embarrassing. It's like I'm 5 years old. I'm sorry, but I'm calling the school. If there’s no other way... So, how was it yesterday? Did you finish the project? Did Gabriel say anything about me? No. He didn't say anything, Gi. And we ended up not making the project. We went to the movies. What do you mean? Gabriel wanted to go to the movies, so we went. Get up, Leo. My leg kind of hurts.. I can't believe you went to the movies without me. But, Gi, We never go to the movies. Why didn't you call me? Sorry, Gi. I didn't think about it at the time. We decided to go and we did. What's that, Gabriel? Belle & Sebastian... A band I like.You know them? No.. My brother likes this song. When I lived in Itapira I shared a room with him and he would always plays this CD before bed. But he never made it to the end. So I stayed up listening to it by myself. look... It's not like a Tchaikovsky but... it's good. Hey. What's it like at the library, Gi? Weren't you going to make the project with Larissa? We are... Okay, I'll call. Kisses. Bye. If we get tired, we can go to Gi's place. Swim! We can also get a 0 on the project as well! Weird... Hello? Hello, Vivaldi? Dumbass! Why did you call me? I wanted to know what was my ringtone on your phone. Okay. You got it wrong, It's not Vivaldi, It's Bach. I don't wanna be Bach. What do you want to be? Can it be Belle & Sebastian? Yup. So you can dance when I call you. a lot happier than Bach, right, Leonardo? Come Dance, Leo. Not me. I don't know how to dance. What do you mean? Look at your little fingers dancing. But *I* don't know how to dance. Leo, There are good and bad dancers, but everyone knows how to dance. Some other day, okay? Boring. There we go! You can.. Dance. Feel free to move your feet, too. I must look ridiculous, Gabriel. -It's not, you can already go to a club now -Shut up, Gabriel! Okay. Your first class. I can't take it anymore with this project in this library -What's the laziness level? -Level 10! I think I might have even gone above that. Level Homicide. Relax, Gi. Next project we're together, okay? -Let's go? -Oh no, please don't go, just a little more Gi, I'm sorry. Bye, Gi. Goodbye, Boys! Impossible, Leo. Seriously. Gabriel, It's easy. Here... The train let out a... How do I know you're telling the truth? You're gonna have to trust me... Give me your hand. Let out a... -Strong.. here, this is an.. -It's impossible. I give up. Gabriel, It's not impossible. It's gonna take me too long to learn this, Gabriel. Impossible is me riding a bike, Gabriel. Not this. Hi, Gabriel. -Do you guys want a juice, something? -No, Thanks. -Thanks mom, we'll be there later -Okay then.If you need me, I'm in the living room. You should read Braille with your eyes. Just like the alphabet... but braille. Here.. -What's this? -Braille Alphabet. Leo, today's the eclipse. Wanna go see it? Of course... of course we'll see the eclipse, Gabriel. Sorry... It's just that my dad said that there's a park right here that would be perfect to see the eclipse. I really wanted to go. Let's go, what time is it? Really late, like 1:30 AM Yeah, forget about it. My mom would never let me go. We can go... hidden. What's fun about an Eclipse? -Watching the moon disappearing from the sky -What do you mean disappearing? -It disappears... I mean... it ceases to be illuminated. Meaning...? Wanna see? Do you know when you're sunbathing And you feel warmth on one side of your face? Well, that side of your face is being illuminated by the sun. What does that have to do with the eclipse? Wait up. Give me your hand. here's the sun. Earth. And the moon. The sun illuminates the earth The moon. And your face. The eclipse happen when all three are perfectly aligned And the light that was on the moon, is not there anymore. And since we can only see what's illuinated, we can't see the moon But it's really fast. And we can see the moon again. -Get it -I think so. Funny, tryin to explain this. It looks so simple. Leo, I forgot my hoodie in your bedroom. Can you bring it to me tomorrow? -Yes I can. No worries. -Thanks. -See ya -See ya Ma, for how long have you and pops been together? It's been a long time... let me see... 71... Wow... 42 years. Wow, that's a lot of time. Do you still love each other? Some days more than others... How'd you two meet? It was before we came to São Paulo. He was the bus driver, for the bus I took to go to work. In reality, I could take a later bus, but I always got on a little early, just to go with him I remeber one day i was late. I was desparate To my surprise, he was still there. Refusing to leave until I got there. And the people all screaming at him, a mess. And when I got there, they weren't happy at all. It's really early for your mom to come pick you up No. It's Gabriel. We have to work on a project and I asked him to meet me here. Really? Hello? That's me Really?! Shoot, Andreia, they can't. My parents are travelling. They're only coming back next week. Is it okay if I call you when they're back? Okay, Thanks. You're parents are travelling? No. I was the lady from the exchange agency. She said she found an american agency that specializes on blind kids. -Why did you lie? -I don't know. Your mom will never allow it. Thanks for the support, Gi. Hi! -Hey... -Hey. How are you? Have you seen Gabriel around? He's gone to the bathroom and will be right back, why? Nothing. I just wanted to talk to him about something. He's cute, huh, Gi? And those hair curls. So cute! He's not from São Paulo. Where is he from again? -I think he's from... -He's over there, kisses. She's really a slut, huh? See? She already got him... Being all cute, talking to him, playing with her hair... She touched his shoulder! She's holding his hand! She doesn't even know if he washed it! Too bad she doesn't even try to cover it up, right? I don't think you need the cane anymore. Okay. Did you hear Karina's question on Chemestry class? -What a shame. So dumb. -Poor girl... Poor girl, but kind of boring, right? You think she's cool? I think she's nice. -She even invited me to her party -What party? The super party she's hosting. She's moving and the house will be empty. She invited the whole classroom. -Fun, huh? -Watch your step. I'm even going to be the DJ. Why?! I like Karina, Leo. Why don't you like her? It's not that I don't like her... It's just that a party full of people from our classroom is the last place I want to be at. Think about it. It could be fun. People are different outside the school. -I doubt it... -Aren't you? Should I leave the door open, Leo? No, you can close it. Hey Gi. Yes, I am. Giovanna, wants to talk to you. Hey, Gi. Shoot... Sorry, my phone must be in my backpack. I'm home. We're about to work on the project What? Weren't you gonna stay to work on the project with Larissa? Sorry, Gi. Giovanna? What? Giovanna was pissed as fuck cause we didn't wait for her by the exit... But wasn't she going to work on the project with Larissa? Apparently, no... Let's go, Leo? Without Giovanna? No way, Gabriel, She would kill us. She justs passed us without saying bye. -Really? -Really. Then... Let's go. Hey, Leonardo. New boyfriend? This boy is doing you some good! You're becoming a man! -It's hot. -Thanks, mom. I was thinking about studying abroad. What do you guys think? -Do what, Little Lion? -An exchange. The other day some people at school talked about it and now I want to do it. -Are you talking about living outside of the country? -Yeah. You can only be joking, Leo... -Here we go... -Go? No, we're ot going anywhere... -Explain it to us a little better, son. -Explain what?! Are you crazy? -There's no way Leo's going abroad on his own and that's final. -But why? -Why, Leo? -A lot of people do it. What's the problem? Even if we agreed, we would take a blind boy in their home? -Where'd you get this? -In an exchange agency. There's one in Los Angeles that is for blind people. -Let me see... -Their number is there if you want to call to see who's taking care of me. -How's your English? Is it good? -There's no discussion, Leo. You're not going. Period. It must be cause I swim a lot. I did it a lot back in my city. Sometimes I hit the gym, too. What are you doing here? Yeah, I can tell. We could go for a swim together one of these day. Shoot. I don't have my togs... Who said we need it? You're on, girl. Gabriel, answer me! You have my phone number, right? Dad Dad! What, son? Are you okay? Can you help me to shave? Wait up. Here you go. Give this to me, and get the cream. That's too much. Hold up. I'll throw some of it out. There. now spread it on your face. It's me. Watch your mouth. Let me see. Yeah, you can wash your hands. Now but the Gillette in the hot water. You'll see it will be much easier. Son, I was thinking about that exchnage thing you talked about. -Really? -Really, but you can't talk while you shave. Sorry... I'm trying to understand why you want to go so far away... I think it's very natural for you at your age to want to... I don't know, see new places... Meet different people, make new friends, I don't know, I think that's normal. But I think it's very natural for you to fight with your parents all the time. I was like that too... But I think that leaving the country to escape the fight is too radical. Get it? So... I don't know, I was thinking about talking to your mom about that. But first I need to know if you want to travel for the right reasons. Do you agree, Little Lion? -Shh, do you agree? -I can speak now? Agreed, dad. -What do you think? -Let me see... psh Are you having fun? -What's his name? -Pudim -Hey, Pudim, drink up, dude. -No, he's a "baby" You know Pudim? Pudim, this is Giovanna. Hey, Pudim... Get up out of there. Go dance! Are you gonna stay there? -Hey -Hey! -So. Eyeballing anyone? -Did you see who came? Oh yea, that's true! Go for it! Hey, Dj. -Hey. -Pudim wants to request a song! -Put him on his little bed, please? -Tired, Pudim? He's a baby, he goes to sleep early. Go dance. You look like Giovanna, sitting still. I'll go dancing soon. What are you guys hiding? -Nothing... We have Vodka and Whisky. Want some? Pure? Careful, huh? -Cheers -Cheers!! Leo, come dance. -Karina, I set up a playlist, It's going to play for a while, okay? -Of course, enjoy. Leo? You on the floor? Finally, huh? Interesting, huh? Don't forget about dancing with your feet. I'm gonna go grab something to drink, you want anything? -I'll go with you. -Oh no, now that you started to dance you're gonna dance here with me. I'll be right back. Leo, I actually wanted to talk to you about something -Right now? -Yeah, It's better now that we're alone. Okay. Did Gabriel ever talk to you about me? -What do you mean? -Like... if he's into me. No... What's up, Gigi? Let's kill the longing of out last party? If I were to kill something, it wouldn't be longing from our last party. So, that's how it's gonna be? Yes. Okay. What's up, Rodrigo? What's up, Gi? What are you drinking? Don't know... What do you mean you don't know? Can I try it? You could help me out. Throw him some hints. -Sure.. -Oh Really?! Thanks, Leo. You're a sweetheart Okay. So I'll check out the party, okay? It's time for the kissing game! Yeah, go. Make a circle. What's up, Leo? Come play with us. -No, thanks -C'mon, Leo. Stay, it'll be fun! No, I don't feel like it. C'mon, Leo. Or do you want to be a kissing virgin forever? -You're such an asshole, Fábio, I don't have a problem with the game -Prove it, and stay. Okay. I'll stay. Let's sit there, then. Dmitri, move... Turn, turn, there. Sit. So, I'll start I'll spin the bottle. And whoever it's pointing at Will have to kiss me. Cool. Shouldn't you be taking care of your little buddy? He's okay. Actually, you're the one that should talk to him. Talk about what? He doesn't like me anymore. That's it. That's absurd, Giovanna It's true. And to top it all, he doesn't care about talking to me. Wait... Weren't you the one that didn't answer his call? Cause he thinks that you don't want to talk to him. This is all your fault My fault, Why? Things were great before you arrived. Now I'm not even talking to my best friend. Let's go matheus, represent! And there was that time you went to the movies and didn't even invite me. Gi... it wasn't on purpose. Leo didn't do it on purpose. Of course he did. He doesn't even want me to take him to his place anymore. It's all you, you, you, you... There it is... You don't even know how to respond... Sorry guys. Cow... Very well... Ladies & Gentlemen... This is the moment many of us were waiting for. I believe many of you are here, just because of her. Am I right, Marta? Me? No... Marie... Idiot... Scored! You really scored, dude. C'mon, get up, Marta. Gui, help him up. Get up, Get up. Sorry for getting between you and Leo. Too late, huh? Sorry, anyway... I just wanted to understand Leonardo, you know? This whole exchan ge story... He didn't even think about me, staying here alone. How can your best friend want to leave without even thinking about you? Wait... What exchange story? Leonardo wants to study abroad, didn't he tell you? No. Stay calm, people. I think that, since this is a really important moment in little Leo's life, I think we should put some music on. What do you guys think? But that's not what matters... It matters that he doesn't care about me anymore. He switched me for you in ten seconds and it's almost like he didn't notice. -It's not like that, Gi. -It's like that exactly. You don't know how things were before you came around... Why don't you tell him that, then? We should say the things we feel. It doesn't help to keep it. Right? A little more.... yes, just a little bit. Are you guys crazy!? Giovanna, what are you doing?! Giovanna, are you crazy!? -Let's just go, Leo. -I can't believe you're jealous because of Marta as well... Weren't you the one saying I had to kiss someone?! Look, Gi... I was bummed that we were separated, but you're different... I don't know if I can trust you anymore. Go fuck yourself, Leonardo. Where's Giovanna? She left. Why? The party is great, Gabriel. You want to act like Giovanna? Why don't you go after Karina? -Seriously, Leo, Let's go... It's late. -Gabriel, I don't get it... First you drag me to the party and now you want to drag me out of it? What's happening? Answer me, Gabriel. Why are you talking to me like that? Why are you so mad? Cause everyone wants to control me and nobody wants me to kiss anybody! No new calls.

Are you gonna use some sunscreen, Leo? No. I hate sunscreen. Not even on your face? Okay. There's a little leftover. What about your body? You're starting to sound like my mom, Gabriel. I think the relationship is getting spiceeyeah Take care of your life, you clown. Look at him getting pissed off. So, Leo... Let's go? We've waited long enough... Of course not. I'm not showering with a bunch of people, Gabriel. -That's so childish... -It's not childish. -Shit... It's so embarrassing. Well, Leo. Get over it. I'm going... No. Wait, Gabriel. Dummy. There's no one here. Somebody must've left it running. Take off your clothes and I'll help you getting in the shower. I'm ready. What do you mean 'ready'?

Sorry I talked to you like that at Karina's Party. Shit, Leo. They were gonna make you kiss a dog. -What? -What what? What dog? -Oh, Leo. -Giovanna, what dog? When I dragged you out of the party, Fábio was holding up a dog in front of you. Thanks for getting me out of there I'm sorry too. I think I exxagerated when I was mad at you. -But you changed me for Gabriel so quickly. -Of course I didn't, Gi. I'll never change you. Imagine an eclipse.. you know? Earth is in the way of the moon, and it disappears from the sky, but it's stil there. And then the earth gets out of the way and you can see the moon again. -Just like us -I'm not understandinganything. What does that have to do with us? It's just that if this were an eclipse Gabriel would be the Earth and you would be the moon. And you'd be the sun, handsome? Yeah.... nah, c'mon, it depends. If it were a solar eclipse, you'd be the sun. Gorgeous... Where's Earth? Hangin out with meteor Karina. Wanna go drink with them? Yup. Didn't see them yet? No. Are you sure you can't see them anywhere? No, Leo. Maybe they're hooking up... You think so?! Ah, they've been so close lately. Wanna know what? Let's go drinking without them, then. Where do you think there's vodka? Hey, Carlinhos. You've got any Vodka? Giovanna? Karina's party did you some good, huh? Yeah, maybe I'm an alcoholic. -Come in. -Wait up, Leo's here. -Get in. -Excuse me. Welcome to my HQ -Are you drinkin, Leo? -Yup. -Wicked.... Thanks. Carlinhos, have you seen Gabriel around? I did. He was with Karina. But that was a while ago. Those two don't ever let go, huh? Cheers! Am I good looking? What do you mean? Do you think people think I'm good looking? I do. Not you, Gi... I mean, do you think other people think I'm good looking? I don't know, Leo. I never noticed other people's reactions. Ask Karina Nah... she thinks Gabriel is good looking. Will you miss me, if I go study abroad? Very much. -Me too. -Do you think we would still be friends if you went? Of course. -I need to tell you something -Wow, how serious. -It's because it's not simple -Just say it, Leo... Is there anyone close? Everyone is very far. I think I'm in love with Gabriel. Hey... -What do you mean "in love"? - In love like "Boyfriend" Aren't you gonna say anything? -I'm out of drinks, Leo. I'll go get some -Gi? Leo! -Get in the water! -Come, Leo. It's really good.

Sorry, I always forget. I can't guys, I don't have my togs. We don't either! Who says we need it? Come quick! Leo, you're so hot. Here's the thermometer. I can't believe you got sick.. Aren't you the responsible adult? -It's just a col, mom... -Cold... You teacher told me you were swimming in the middle of the night. Here's some tea. And we're supposed to let you study abroad after this, huh? -It sounds like you never did anything wrong -I did, but this is different. -Why? -Cause you're my son, Leo. I don't want anything bad happening to you. -It doesn't matter what you're like -Yeah, right. -One day you'll have your own kids, and youll get it. -Not me. I don't want kids. No? Why not? -There's a lot of people in the world already. -You can adopt one. One day you'll meet someone, Start dating and who knows? -I doubt it -What do you doubt? That you'll be dating or that you'll want to have kids? Both. You're too young. You shouldn't try to force things... A lot of things... A lot of things will happen. A lot will change... You're still gonna have lots of colds and flus. It's good for you to know that I'm gonna keep trying to keep you healthy -Soon I'll call you for lunch, okay? -'Kay. Hi. Hey, Gi. How are you? Good. You? I'm okay. I see... I heard you got sick? Yeah, I did. You think you're gonna go to school tomorrow? I don't know. So... you like Gabriel, huh? Dummy. Sorry I dodged the bullet. It's just that I never thought about you like that. Well, I never thought we would fight either.. so... -Weren't you that wanted a big drama? -No. I wanted a Romance. Like you do. But in my case there's also some drama. Cause my romance is hooking up with Karina. -Is he though? -It's quite obvious... You said it yourself... But we never know those things... You, for example... I think you two would be a cute couple... Have you talked to Leo? -He sent me a text. Said he was sick -Yeah. You should stop by his place. Today's Wednedsay. He's there... alone -Who is it? -Gabriel. Only I got sick, huh? Oh, Poor little feller... But Karina did say that that pool was really bad on her hair. Too much chlorine. Did you hook up with Karina? No... Why? You guys vanished at camp. And everyone was talking about you two. Well... Remember that time you were alone talking to giovanna? I thought I should leave you two alone solving your things and went looking for drinks with Karina. When I got there, she tried to kiss me. But I turned my face. Shoot. What did she do? Asked me why I didn't want to kiss her. -What did you tell her? -Made up some girlfriend I have in Itapira. After I said that, she opened her heart out.... And started telling me a thousand stories from her Ex's and I told some stories about this fake girlfriend. The more we talked, the more we drank. When I noticed, we were already in the people. That's when you arrived. You must've drank a lot at her party, huh, Gabriel? What do you mean? If you drank so much at camp, and still remembers everything... I wonder how much you had to drink to have that alcoholic amnesia. But, Gabriel... Why didn't you hook up with her? Well.. It's that I actually like someone else... Do I know that person? You do. And, does this person like you too? I don't know if in the same way I like them... Actually... I've even kissed this person... But it was just a peck. You know... quick... But then I got embarrased, didn't say anything. They didn't either. So I thought I should just give up... Leo... If you stole a kiss... how would you return it? The Spartan society was divided between: something something something.;.; The children something were sent to the army.... -Is this room 211? -You... -Are William, right? -Yes, William. Come in... -Is that chair empty? -Yes it is. -Is this your backpack?: -Yes. Keep going. The men should dedecate their whole lçives to the army... Only after turning 60 they were free of the military service. Look at that. The relationship is really Holding up, huh, Leonardo? You got fucked, jackass...
