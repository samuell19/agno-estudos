(electric sizzling) (ominous music) (creature huffs and growls) (creature breathes loudly) - I'm so bored. (creature huffs) All right. I'm gonna make some popcorn. (creature huffs) (ominous music) (creature huffs) (creature growls softly and sniffs) (creature grunts) (crashing) (suspenseful music) (creature growls) (creature growls) There's something in the house. Yes, there's something in the house. There's something in the house. Oh my gosh, please hurry! (creature huffs and pants) (creature pants) (suspenseful music) - Kayla! Get in the house! It's not in there, it's out here! (crickets chirping) (soft breathing) (creature grunts softly) (creature pants) (creature growls) (creature growls loudly) - [Man] Holy shit! (creature roars) (creature growls softly) (creature sniffs) (creature growls) (creature growls) (creature growls loudly) (dramatic, energetic rock music) (indistinct chattering) - [Woman] Your boyfriend's here. - Um, hey, will you tell him I'll be there in a minute? I've gotta drop this coffee off at table seven and then check in on the kitchen. - I sure will, in a sec. (man grunts softly) - Oh, crap. - Is everything all right here, sir? - Uh, actually no. My bacon wasn't crispy, my eggs were running all over the place, and my toast is burned. - Well, your eggs were scrambled. But it seems like you ate a lot of it already. - Well, I struggled with most of it, and I'm not satisfied at all. - How about I go get the kitchen to make you another plate? How's that sound? - No, no! No, my stomach's upset now. - Hey Nick, Marilynn is busy over there. But she'll be here in a minute. Can I get you anything? - Coffee. - Extra cream, right? - Yeah. - Okay, got it. There we go. - Joan. - Yeah? - Why's Lisa here today? Shouldn't she be at school? - Oh, she wasn't feeling well. And you know, on such a short notice, there's no way she could get a sitter. - I'm sorry, sir. Like I said, I'd be happy to get you another plate. - [Customer] I said I wanted crispy bacon! - Hi, Nick. - Lisa, how you doing? - I'm good. - Ah, you're good? I heard you were sick today. - Oh, that's what I meant. (coughs weakly) I'm not feeling so well. - Well, I hope you feel a little bit better. Wouldn't want you getting behind in school. - Can you keep a secret? - Of course. - Well, I'm not really sick. I just didn't wanna go to school today. - Why didn't you wanna go to school today? - Well, I told Marty Schulz that I wanted to marry him someday. And he told all of his friends and they all laughed at me. - Lisa, you're in sixth grade. I think you're a little too young to be worrying about marriage. - Oh silly, I meant in high school or someday. - Well, I think Marty'd be a lucky man to marry you at any age. - You really think so? - I'm sure of it. - Now, when will you come to your senses? - Come into my senses? - When are you gonna marry my mom? - I'd be better off if you were better at your job. Oh, what's this? You called the Army in? What can I do for you, captain? - Is that any way to talk to a lady? - Well, you know, I mean, there'd be no problem here if they got my order right. - John, I get it. After they closed the mine, times have been tough for everybody. But you can't be treating people like this. - That's easy for you to say. You got a job. - Tell you what. - What's this for? - If you don't want it, I'll take it back. - No, that's okay. I'm just asking what it's for. - Just like to help you out. Got a job opening, State Park. - A state job? That's a great job, man. That's better than shoveling shit at Jacob's farm. - All right, the pay's not that great. It's my old position. But at least it'd be a start. - Well, that's okay, man, I need a job. - [Nick] Could you come in for an interview Monday at 11? - Absolutely. My wife would be really happy. - One more thing. You've got to quit drinking. Can you do that? - Yeah, I can do that. - Can I have that? - You just asked me to quit drinking. Now you want my flask and you drink my alcohol? - I want your flask so you don't drink it. - Oh. - All right. I'll see you Monday at 11 o'clock. Make sure she gets a good tip, all right? And don't forget, no drinking. You can do that? - Right, yeah, I can do that. - [Nick] All right, see you Monday. - Starting tomorrow. - [Joan] Hi, Tom. - Hey, Joan, can I get a cup of coffee, please? - Sure, I'll bring it right over. (Tom sighs) - Oh, hello, Tom. - Hey John, how you doing? - I'm doing all right. - How about a little ride home? - I'd like that. - I'm ready when you are. - All right. - Joan, I'm gonna have to cancel that coffee, okay? Thank you. - Howdy, babe. I know you are so busy. I'm sorry to stop in. But tonight, I got something special planned. - Yeah? - [Nick] Six o'clock. - Okay. - I'm picking you up. Put something nice on. I'll see you then. - Okay. - Right, I love you. - Love you. - [Tom] How you doing there? - Fine, thanks. - Where you headed? - I was gonna go up in the hills to camp. - Oh yeah. Well, there are plenty of places to pick from. Looks like you got perfect weather, too. - Sure is. - Well, you go and have yourself a good time now, and be safe, okay? - All right, thank you. (gentle guitar music) - I wanna live a metaphor life. You know, like I read in that book. People say, "He lived a life worth living." That's what I'm going for. And right there. Morning sun, man. This is where we get the National Geographic-level finish, man. - Heck, yeah. I was here last week and there were turkeys everywhere. - That's what I'm talking about. See, we don't have to sell a documentary series. I don't need to be a star. We're the documentary, the turkeys are right there. - I wanna be a filmmaker and stuff. - Exactly. So we go slow, right? Stealth, whatnot. And then you utilize your cinematographic expertise. - Like cinematic art. - I'm talking Smithsonian Channel, brother. This ain't no Honey Boo Boo. (gentle guitar music) (huffs) (gentle guitar music) (engine starts) (car rumbles softly) - Goddammit! John Hicks. Oh hi, Honey, how you doing? Yeah. Look, you never mind about that land and my brother, okay? My daddy said, "Do not sell the land to anybody." I don't, (stutters) Honey, I, listen, (stutters) wait a minute. I was down at Tammy's. Tammy's, the restaurant down on Canal Street. Yes. Listen, the Ranger came over to me and he told me that I have a job interview at 10 o'clock on Monday. Yes. I am not drunk. Honey, (stutters) look. (stutters and huffs) Honey, look, honey. Whoa, Honey, (vocalizes hissing and grumbling) yeah, (stutters) breaking up. Yeah, oh, (stutters). (soft guitar music) Why'd she got to piss me off? (mutters to himself) (twig crackles) Hey, who is that? (eerie guitar music) (door squeals) - Hi. - Hi. - Are we still on for tonight? - Of course. - What time am I picking you up? - 7:30. - Nice. That's a real nice color on you, too. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - So you're gonna pick me up at my home? - Yeah, 'course. - Okay. - Now, you gotta drive over to the diner by yourself. (woman huffs) - All right, so 7:30, okay? - Yeah, I'll pick you up at your house. - [woman] Okay. - All right, Sweetheart. - Bye. (gentle guitar music) (gunshot bangs) - [Man] Woo-hoo, heck yeah! It's a damn clean shot. - [Nick] You boys enjoying yourselves? - [Both] Uh. - Yeah, guess you could say that. - You guys do know that shooting a deer outside of the season is against the law, right? - Well, yeah, but, we didn't shoot this deer. This deer was dead when we come upon it. Ain't that right, Ernest? - That's right, Jeb, it was dead. We just walked right up on it. - [Jeb] Yep. - All right, so you're expecting me to believe that you guys were just walking through the forest on this trail, with guns, and you came across a dead deer? - Yup, yes sir. That's quite a story. Well, you don't mind if I check your guns, then, do you? - [Jeb] Wait, don't you need a warrant to do that? - Oh yeah, don't you need a warrant? - A warrant? No, no, we're all good. Don't worry about it. All right, this gun is clean. Mind if I check this gun? (gun clicks) Yeah, we got a problem, guys. (both grunt and stutter) (shot blasts) Get back here. (Jeb chuckles) Why? Why would you run? - Scared, I guess. - That gun was fine. I don't think I need to ask, but who's the owner of this gun? - That'd be mine, sir. - Now, wasn't that easier than lying? - Oh man, you're not gonna give us a ticket, are you? - Don't you think you deserve one? - Well, yeah, but, couldn't you give us a break? - Yeah, come on, give us a break. - Did you give this deer a break? - Yeah, right through the neck, can't you see that? (chuckles) - Shut up, Ernest. - All right, guys. You're catching me in a very good mood, 'cause I'm gonna be proposing to my lady tonight. - Oh! Hey, well, congratulations. - Good luck, man. - Yeah, yeah. I'm sure she's gonna say yes. You're a good looking man, don't you think? - What, you getting queer on me or something? - No man, I'm just saying. - Whatever. - Anyway. I'm gonna let you guys off with just a warning this one time. But I want you guys to take this deer down to my truck. (Ernest huffs) I'll take the guns, you grab-- - You serious? - Are you serious? - Do I look serious? Let's go. - (stutters) Could we gut it first? - Does it look like we have time to gut it? Let's go! - Shot it through the neck. What were you thinking? (both grunt and groan) (soft breathing) - Hey, who is that? Hey, who is that? You don't understand who you're messing with! Hey, who keeps doing that? Cut that out! You know I'm gonna find you. (creature grunts softly) Hey, come out here! (creature grunts softly) Who's out there? Oh, the heck with it. (mutters to himself) You ain't supposed to be here. This is private land. (shot booms, creature roars) (low, tense music) (creature grunts) Hey, you come out from behind that tree. (creature huffs and grunts) (shot booms) (creature grunts) (creature roars) (John screams) (blood squelches) (creature grunts and whines) (roars sadly) - [Paula] Wow. First class service. - I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean by that. - Car, silly. - Oh. Well, my real car is in the shop, so it's gonna have to do. - That's okay. This is awesome. Can you turn the lights on? - Uh, for you I can. Boom. - Whoop, whoop! - There you go. - That's awesome. - Pretty cool, huh? You like that? - I like it. - Guess where I'm taking you. - [Paula] Where? - Just, we're going to this place, they serve nothing but caviar and champagne. - That's it? I have to work after, I can't drink. - Okay, well, actually I'm taking you to the diner. I was messing with you. - [Paula] Ooh, wow. (both chuckle) - Is that okay? - That's okay. - It's all right? All right. - Let's do it. - You sure? - Yeah. - All right, let's do it. - Okay, let's go. (creature growls softly) (both creatures growl and grunt softly) (larger creature roars and grunts) (roars) (creature breathes softly) (sniffs) (breathes softly) (tense, suspenseful music) (breathes softly) (tent rustles softly) - Shit. (creatures growls softly) (tense music intensifies) (creature breathes softly) (creature growls loudly) (creature roars) (cracking and squelching) (creature roars and huffs) (roars) - So, uh, Paula, I had a really nice time. - I had a really awesome time, Tom. - Really? - Um-hm. - Is it something you'd like to do again? - Of course. - Okay. Well, we definitely should then. - We should. Oh wow, I gotta be at work in 15 minutes. - Okay. - Okay. - All right. (car door slams) - See you tomorrow. - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. (sighs) - Ma'am? Uh, you okay? - Did you see it? - Uh, see what, ma'am? - A big, hairy creature or something. It just jumped up in front of me. I swerved to miss it and hit this tree. - Are you sure about that? - Yes, it was, it just jumped out so fast that I, uh, didn't have time to react. - Uh, well, it was most likely a deer, don't you think? - Sonny, I know what a deer looks like, and this was no deer. It was ungodly big, huge. - Uh-huh. Ma'am, could you tell me your name, please? - Oh yeah. My name is Lois Stevens. I live up the road from here. - I'm gonna need to see your license and your proof of insurance, please. I'm gonna call you an ambulance and probably most likely a tow truck. If you could give me that paperwork, I'd appreciate it. - You sit tight, okay? I'll be right back. Just sit there. Don't move too much 'cause you might be injured, okay? I'm not allowed to touch you or move you. - Thank you. - I'll be back couple of minutes, sit tight. Dispatch, it's 239. I got a single car accident, license plate Frank, Nora, Edward, five, one, nine, seven. I'm out on Route 28, about two and a half miles south of 33. Looks like I'm gonna need an ambulance and most likely a tow truck. Copy that? - [Paula Through Speaker] Okay, 239, we're on it. - Okay, copy that. Miss Stevens, hi. I'm gonna try and open the door, just give you a little bit more room, okay? Looks like it's a little jammed, so hang on. - Okay. (Tom grunts softly) (door thuds, Lois gasps) - [Tom] You okay? - Uh, yeah. - The ambulance is on its way, okay? I'm not really allows to touch you or move you. But why don't we just get back to, you know, what you were talking about, you telling me about what you saw? - Uh, well, at first sight I thought it was a person. But it was way too big for that. No way it was a man. - [Tom] Too big, huh? - It was huge and furry, with long arms and very tall. It took maybe two or three steps to cross the road. - Uh-hm. - Well, you do believe me, don't you? - Oh yeah, no, of course I do. - [Lois] Oh. - Ambulance is gonna be here soon. - Okay. - Okay. (Lois sighs) (dog barking) - Bear, quiet down. - Hey, why is Bear barking, Tommy? - I don't know, Mom. What is it, Bear? Something out there, buddy? (dog barking) - Tommy, I got another bag for you! - [Tommy] Okay, Mom, I'll be right there! (dog barking) Who's there? Man! What is that smell? (creature growls) (creature roars, Tommy screams) - Tommy! Tommy, what is it? (pants) What? Tommy, where are you? Tommy, please come out. Oh my God, what was that? Oh my God! (pants) - 911, may I help you? - Yes, it's my son. He's been kidnapped. - Okay, ma'am, calm down and tell me where you are. - I live at 1314 School Rod Road. Please send someone, hurry! - Okay, tell me what happened. - Oh, he was taking out the garbage and I asked him to come and get another bag, and he said okay and the next thing I know, he's screaming for me. He's screaming my name, "Mom!" I go running out of the house and I'm looking and I don't see him anywhere. I heard him calling for me, started coming out, and all of a sudden I see someone running really, really fast through the woods. - Was it your son going through the woods? - No, no, there's no way! It was going way too fast and he's only 12 years old. Please, please send someone, hurry! Hurry, come and help me get my son. - Okay, Mrs. Jones. I have a deputy nearby. - Okay, okay, send him down please. Thank you, thank you so much. Please hurry! - [Paula Through Speaker] 239 dispatch. - Yeah, dispatch, it's 239. - [Paula Through Speaker] We have a missing child over at 1314 School Rod Road. Is it possible for you to check this out as soon as possible? - Well, I'm finishing up here in about five, 10 minutes. So I can get there real quick if you need me to. - [Paula Through Speaker] All right, thank you. - Copy that. - Ambulance is coming, but here's my card. Wanna give it to you. If you have any questions, you need anything, you just give me a call, okay? - Okay, all right. - [Tom] Ambulance be here any second. You just hang tight, all right? - Thank you, officer. (tense music) (brake squeals, creature growls) - (pants) Help me, help me! Oh my God, it's my son. - What's the matter, ma'am? - He's missing! My son is missing! - Okay, okay, calm down, calm down. Step away from the vehicle, please, so I can help you. - [Mrs. Jones] Please, please help me. - Talk to me, slow down, calm down. Calm down, tell me what happened. - He was taking out the trash. He was taking out the trash, and then he was already out there, so I asked him, please just take another bag for me. - All right, ma'am, show me where this happened. - It was right over there. - Do you see it, can you see the barrel? - Yeah, I can see it. - He was right there. And then they was running really fast right through there. It was something, I know it was my son. (gasps) - Okay. Was there anything that you noticed that was unusual? - Just the dog. Our dog was barking hysterically. And it wasn't like him at all. It was just odd. - Uh-uh, how so? - Well, like it was trying to protect him or something. It was just really different. - Okay, okay. - I don't know. - Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna need you to just calm down, okay? I'm gonna go up there, I'm gonna check it out, all right? - Okay. - So stay right here. - Okay. Just, just please be careful. Be careful! (suspenseful music) (tense music) (sniffs) Oh my God, damn! Shit. (huffs) All right, ma'am. I did not see anything out there. - Okay. - Okay? But if something did happen, they probably went in that direction. - [Mrs. Jones] So what are you saying? Are you saying somebody kidnapped him? - No, no, no, no. Don't jump to conclusions, okay? I'm gonna go over to my radio, I'm gonna call in search and rescue team. They're gonna come down-- - Thank you. - And they're gonna look for your son, see if they can find him, okay? This is what I want you to do right now. No, stop, stop, don't talk. Don't jump to conclusions, okay? We don't know anything that happened, all right? Okay, so this is what I need you to do. I'm gonna give you my card. - Okay. - Okay? You have any questions, you call me. But I need you to go in there, sit down, and wait until search and rescue comes, 'cause I'm gonna go, I'm gonna call 'em in right now. - Thank you so much. - Okay? Calm down, it'll be fine. We'll find your son, everything's gonna be fine. - [Mrs. Jones] I just want him home. - Of course you do. I do, too, ma'am. Go in there and sit down, darlin'. - Thank you so much. - I'm gonna call it in right now. - [Mrs. Jones] Okay. (sobs) (creature huffs and grunts softly) - [Tom] Hey Paul, will you check this out for me? - [Paul] What you got? - [Tom] I found it about an hour ago at a crime scene. Mrs. Jones' boy. - This is ripe. Well, it's not canine. There's pieces of hide here. (mumbles) - Can you just give me a second? I gotta talk to dispatch. - [Paul] Yeah, I'll be right here. - [Tom] Okay. (gentle guitar music) (men chatter softly) - Camera right there. - Okay. - [Younger Man] Man, this is it. - Don't get any better than that. - Hey, check, it's a turkey call. Turkey call, no turkey call? Yeah? Meh, I'll give it to you later. (mutters to himself) Lookin'. We need a flashlight. - What the hell? Brian, Brian, you gotta see this. - [Brian] Hold on, man. I gotta find my, my other flashlight-- - No, no, you gotta see this. - What? - [Man] Look! - Oh shit. (creature huffs) That's like a big-ass bear or something. - That ain't no freaking bear. It's got arms! It's a Sasquatch. - Goddammit, man! I'm on meds and I drink! Not funny, I don't believe you! He's, it's moving, it's moving this way. Uh. No, no. It's running this way. - Oh shit, man! (creature grunts) (both yammer) (creature growls) - Man, this is gonna be historical damn footage! - Come on, let's-- - Okay, okay, okay. (Brian babbles) Damn, no signal. Damn Obamaphone! - Who the hell are you calling? - I'm gonna call Bobby. He knows the park ranger. - Run, we gotta get to the truck! (creature growls) - This way! - This way. - Faster, faster! - I am, I am. - My back is killing me, man! (creature roars) I got a signal, I got a signal. (mutters to himself) (phone rings) - Hello? - Hey Bob, how you doin'? - Hey, Brian. Uh, how are you? - I'm doing fine, Bob. Hey, I just need the number for that park ranger guy that you know. - Ranger Nick. Why are you gonna bother him? - Well, don't worry about it, Bob. I just, me and Duane were out filming some turkeys and we seen ourselves a straight up Bigfoot. - A Bigfoot? Yeah, okay. - Yeah, we got the shit on video, okay? So ha ha, Bob. - Yeah, oh yeah, I see Bigfoots out in my back yard all the time, like seven feet tall some of them are. - Oh yeah, you ever seen a nine-foot, jackass? - (sighs) Yeah, okay, um. So here's his number, it's 555-7634. Don't tell him I gave you this number. - We'll try, Bob. Thanks. - He tried to call bullshit on you, didn't he? - Yeah. He was laughing until I told him how big it was. Son of a bitch. (Duane giggles) - So what do you got, Paul? - Well, I can see what it's not. It's not bear, it's not boar. And it's not really a primate. Whatever it is, it gashed itself pretty good because there's traces of blood here. - Look. I gotta tell you something, but you gotta promise to keep it private, okay? A few hours ago, I was investigating an accident, right? A woman had wrecked her car. And get this. She told me the reason why she wrecked was because a big, hairy creature jumped in front of her car. - And? - I didn't think much of it. I thought she was kind of nuts. So I got in my car, I was going over and checking another scene, you know, the missing Jones boy, and, uh, I saw it too. Gotta understand something. This thing was huge. Okay, it was enormous. It were covered in hair, too, like wool or something, it jumped right out in front of my car. And it took off at tremendous speed. - And you found this sample in that area? - Yeah! Listen, Paul, I know what I saw, okay, I know it. I know it sounds totally crazy, like, (stutters) I can't even believe it myself. But I think we may have a Bigfoot on our hands. Or something like it. - We might. You know, I have an old friend of mine, was very experienced in incidences like this. He knows what that smell means. - Okay, great, could you call him even now? - He lives about 100 miles from here. He'll be here in an hour when I call him with this information. We just have to keep it on the down low. - No doubt. - I'll get right on it. - Okay, thanks, buddy. (phone rings) - Ranger Nick Thomas. - Hey, hi, my name is Brian Johnson. I'm a friend of Bob Wilkes. - (laughs) How is old Bob nowadays? - Oh, he's doing fine, sir. Hey, listen, the reason why I'm calling is, me and my partner, we see a really, really weird thing up on the, in the Hawking Hills area this morning. - Okay. What exactly did you see? - Well, I'm just gonna give it to you straight, ranger. We seen a Bigfoot. - A Bigfoot? - It might sound a little crazy. But the fact is, we got it on video. Me and my partner Duane have it. - All right, first things first. Where exactly did you see this? It's only about a mile up on Happy Hollow Road. - Okay. You know, I'm actually not that far from that spot. How about you meet me at the intersection of 56 and Happy Hollow Road in, say, 15, 20 minutes? - You've got it, man. - All right, I will see you there. - Boom! (both yell over each other) Very dangerous, very dangerous. Drive, drive without passing. Please, go. - Hey, thanks for meeting me, guys. Ranger Nick Thomas. - How ya doing, man? - Duane. - So, uh, area's right up there. Are you ready to go? - Yeah, let's do it. (gun safeties click) Who, uh, we're not gonna need those, are we? - When you see the size of this thing, you'll understand. - Okay, well, why don't you show me the footage and then I'll understand. - Well, we kinda figured it'd be best to take you to the actual place. That way you can get an idea how big it is. - All right, fair enough. Let's go. All right, so which one of these trails are we gonna be taking here? - Well, we ain't going that way, 'cause that's where the Bigfoot went. We'll go up this way. - Sure, boss, come on. - [Duane] After you. - You guys ever hunted in this area before? - Yeah, I have. - Who owns this land? - Old man Turner. He's my dad's friend. (creature huffs) (sniffs) (huffs and grunts) This is it. - This is where you saw it? - Yep, this is it. Tell him, Duane. - Well, we were setting up right here, and he was right down there. - Can I see the footage now? - Well, sure. - Go ahead. - All right. That's the trigger right there? - Right there. - Oh my God. That thing is huge! - Thank you. - [Duane] No, it's monstrous huge. - Let's go down to that tree. - All right, I guess I'm not scared. - I mean, look at this. Its arms are lower than its knees. This thing is not human. - It's all right there, bro. - All right, I'm looking at this tree. If we're at standing, this thing's almost nine feet tall. - So who do we call? CNN? Ghostbusters? - Let's take it easy here, man. This is huge. - Life is different from hereon out, bro. It's like alien contact. - So it started walking this way. - [Duane] It's a good thing we got out of here when we did. - It was definitely heading in your direction. - So you had sightings like this reported before, huh? - Yeah, all the time. But it's normally pretty hokey. This is different. We've got proof. This is incredible. - So much for turkey hunting videos, huh? - Francis Coppola says film is a series of brilliant accidents. - Accidents, whatever, brilliant or not, you guys, this thing does look aggressive. I'm just, I'm glad nobody got hurt. (twig cracks) - Holy shit, did you hear that? - Hold on, you guys, just hold on a sec. Don't go shooting. That brush is thick. Just everybody relax. - Oh, oh! (shots crack) Son of a bitch! - [Duane] I hear that. - Whoa, wait a minute. Oh, you guys, look at this. - [Brian] Wow. - You know, that is a foot print. About 20 inches long, 10 inches wide. - I thought I had big feet. - Yeah, the more I think about it, I'm convinced this thing is dangerous. We should get out of here. I got a couple calls I gotta make. - [Brian] Heck, yeah. - Brian, are you comfortable with me holding on to this footage for a little bit? - Tell you what, man. I'm gonna keep the original, I'll give you a copy. - Okay, but seriously, you guys, we gotta keep this on lockdown. Don't be putting it on TMZ, don't go on YouTube with it. - No, man, I'm calling Gloria Allred. This shit's serious. (Nick huffs) - Yeah, this is my retirement, man. - Let's go, guys. (knocking) - There's no birthday party for me here. - Hey, I'm glad you could come. - Hey, good to see you, man. How you doing? - Well. This is very fresh, like last night. - (sniffs) Ho! - Yeah. - Where'd you get this? - Tom found it. Let me see if he's still here. - Tired of sitting in my chair, like, flipping buggers, you know what I mean? - [Duane] I'm hip with that. - My future's bright! - Boom! - Yes! (knocking) - [Woman] Come to this goddamn door, Duane! Open it or I'll beat your ass! - I don't have to take that. (bangs on door) - [Woman] Open this door! - I'm busy. - [Woman] I don't care if you're walking on the damn moon! I need my smokes and my lady products. - You ain't gonna believe what's about to happen, Betty! - [Betty] Shut the fuck up, Brian! - You better pack for L.A. - [Betty] Duane, I'm warning you. - I hear you, Baby, I hear you. - You'll see, Betty. - [Betty] Shut up, crack head. - Hey, I'm sober. I might drink a beer every now and then, snort a little Klonopin, but not like, you know, (vocalizes buzzing). - And here we go. - Yes, yes! All right. We got the original in-- - The place. - The place, hell yeah, full Shawshank, bitch. Worst case scenario? - We meet in the place. Yes! - Okay. - Follow me. - I'll follow you. Listen, we'll get my truck at the end of the driveway. You got the camera. - I got the. - Before we go out, you look right, I'm gonna look left. I think we're safe. - Let's do it. - I see you, motherfuckers! - [Brian] She's a scary son of a bitch! She scares me more than Bigfoot. - [Duane] You ain't married to her! - [Brian] God, I love this shit. I'm so in my fricking element. - I hear ya. - [Brian] Who needs drugs? - Yeah. - [Brian] Crack is whack. - Holy shit, look out! (both scream) (creature roars) (both yell) (creature growls) - [Brian] Grab your shotgun. - Doggone, I got no shotgun. - [Brian] It's behind your seat, you fool. Shoot that bitch! - It, it's gone. - [Brian] Shit, it's gone. Thing's a hairy ghost, man. - Why don't we, we take the long way into town? - [Brian] I heard that. I'll turn this thing around. - All right, I basically just moved the reservation back an hour. No, everything, no, everything's fine. No, I appreciate you being so flexible. Um, you know what? I gotta get going here. No, tonight's gonna be awesome. All right, I love you, too. Bye. - [Brian] Ooh, shit is getting thick, ranger. - Why, what happened? Did somebody contact you? - Somebody needs to call the fucking Air Force, man! - We saw the thing again. And we think the thing is chasing us. - All right, calm down, everybody just calm down. Where's the video? Do you have it? - Go ahead, Duane. Take the whole camera, man. Analyze it all you want. We got the original copy sequestered. So anybody starts any shit about who owns what, everybody can suck my ass. - We'll see you in court. - Um, this is a digital chip. - So what? It ain't the golden chalice, brother, don't worry. - Uh, my point is, it doesn't matter where you hid the original. That's not how the technology works. - You know what, ranger? This whole thing is frankly fucking above you, dude. We should have gone straight to the damn FBI. I mean, come on, you wear shorts. - I was in the Army for five years. I could kick your ass. - Well, wrong on me, then. I was a drug addict and I could not serve. - (sighs) One day, guys. All I'm asking for is one day. I just don't want the whole county going up in hysteria. You know, after that, you can do whatever you want with the footage. - Yeah, well, what about the son of a bitch that's chasing me right now? - Us. - You guys, I gotta get some work done here. - I must be speaking in gibberish. - The thing is out there, man. - All right, we need to do things one step at a time. (Brian sighs) Right now, the step I need you to take is to please leave. - Yeah, right. - Out. (Brian mutters to himself) - I'm Joe Hicks. I'm here to pick up the survey maps for the Hicks estate. - Are you John Hicks' brother? - Yeah. - Police department, may I help you? - Hello, officer. Yeah, this is Ranger Nick Thomas from Lake National Forest. I, uh, I think we've got a problem here. - Okay, what might your problem be, sir? - Well, I got a call earlier from a few turkey hunters, and they've got some video footage of what they think to be a Bigfoot. - Really, a Bigfoot? First off, Mr. Thomas, isn't it, say, a little crazy? - Well, consider this a curtesy call because I do believe that this thing is aggressive and it's in the area. - Now, did you see this Bigfoot, or did some cracked out crack head tell you about it? - Sir, I think you should be taking this call a little bit more seriously. - Oh yeah, why is that, Mr. Ranger? You gonna call my Chief? - Hey Paul, you needed to see me? - Oh, Tom, this is the friend I was telling you about, the expert in the field. - Tom Benson. - Hank Fletcher, good to see ya. So you're the one that saw this, huh? - Yes, sir. - Why don't you tell me about it? - Uh, well, (sighs) I was investigating a woman who drove off the road. So I thought drunk driving. But now, she drove off the road because she saw a giant hairy Bigfoot. - Because we don't know what this thing is, what it's capable of doing, or what it wants. - Answer me this. How do you know that it is not someone in a costume? - It's too damn big to be a guy in a costume. - It's just down here, follow me, please. I wanna thank you, first of all, for coming in on such short notice. - No, it's my pleasure. I'm excited about this. - You instituted a (mumbles)? - [Hank] Yeah. - Yeah, so the first location I wanna take you to is real close. - Good, sooner the better. - Okay, enough is enough! No more of this Bigfoot crap! - Excuse me. Sergeant. Who're you talking to? - It's only a park ranger who claims, get this, there's a Bigfoot on the loose. (scoffs) - Give me that phone, please. Gimme that! This is Detective Benson, who is this? Uh-huh. Okay, hang on, slow down, slow down. Where are you? Uh-huh. I know exactly where that is. Can you stay put for 15 minutes? I'll be right there. You're getting on my bad side. - [Woman] Are we still picking everyone else up? - [Man] No, we're just gonna meet them there. - [Woman] You're gonna love this place, Claudia. There are so many cute boys there. - [Young woman] (chuckles) Frankie, Steph said you're hooking me up with one of your friends, though, right? - [Woman] Wait, what, Steph? - [Frankie] Yeah, I hooked her up. - [Claudia] Come on, Frankie, you hook Susan up and not me? I love you, too. - [Frankie] Sorry, Claudia, but there's gonna be other guys there, don't worry about it. - [Claudia] Yeah, you better hope so. - What the hell is this? - (sighs) What the? - Looks like someone drug it here or something. - [Woman] Yeah, it does. - Hey. - Shit. - Sorry. - Was just looking at what you're looking at. - I don't know. It's fine, I just don't get why I'm so jumpy. - What's up, guys? - Just looking around. We should help. - Yeah, we need help moving this tree. - [Woman] Okay. (twig snaps) - You guys hear that? - Yeah, I heard it. - Damn, dude, you scared the shit out of me. - What are you all doing? - We heard a noise and we're checking it out. - Oh man, let's just move this tree and get out of here. - [Man] What's up, guys?! (girl squeals) - Oh my God! - You scared the shit out of me. (girl laughs) - Sorry, bro, just having fun. - [Man In Blue Shirt] Yeah, funny. - It's good to see you, man. - Yeah, you too. You put this tree here? - Yeah, had to get you to stop somehow, didn't I? - All right, can we please move this and just get out of here? - [Man In Gray Shirt] All right, you're the boss. - [Woman] One, two, three, now. - Thanks for meeting me, guys. Ranger Nick Thomas. - Tom Benson, this is Hank Fletcher. - It's nice to meet you. What do you got? - All right, well, earlier today I got a call from a couple turkey hunters out in the Hawking Hills area. Now they're doing a documentary film, and they came across what they believe to be a Bigfoot. So I went out, checked everything out, and saw the location of the sighting. And get this, they got a video. - Where can we see this video? - Got it right in the truck. Let's go. - God, look at the size of that thing. It's gotta be eight feet. - Nine, and a beauty. - Yeah, I was right there at that tree. We're looking at nine feet. There's also a footprint about 20 inches long. - I say we go check out the footprint right now. - Nick, you tell anybody else? - No, just called your office and talked to Sergeant Moody. - Oh God, what'd he say? - (scoffs) More like Sergeant Asshole. Told me I was crazy, said the guys are probably on drugs. Very unprofessional. - He's not exactly Mr. Popularity. The other day I was dealing with a missing child case-- - Wait, wait. You say there's a missing child? - Yeah, what about it? - This is just a hunch, all right? But just maybe this missing kid and our Sasquatch are connected. - How do you figure? - [Hank] Humans and primates share 96% of their DNA code. It's the most of any other mammal. There been actual cases where human children have been raised by primates. Most recently, the feral child of Borneo and the Nigerian chimp boy. Maybe the Sasquatch abducted this kid to raise it as one of their own for some reason. I don't know, but it's just a guess. And I say we should go check the area. - Well, now, search and rescue is still there, searching for the kid. - Great. If it did take him, maybe we'll find him. - Let's take my truck, just in case we got to off road. - I'll get a couple of walkies and a shotgun. - All right, pilgrim. - Hey. (people muttering) - I'm glad to see you made it, little brother. - Hey, how you doing? - Another day in paradise. - You still (mumbles) like Rambo up here? - Always running your mouth, smartass. But yeah, little bit of Rambo here. - [Woman] Wait, I don't think that's the one I'm looking for. - I mean-- - I'm hypnotizing you. - I mean, you could be tantalizing. If that's-- - Ooh! (man chuckles) - Is it cool? - Aren't there more people than this? - Yeah, but there's a concert or something going on in town. It's supposed to be a pretty big thing. But I mean, we got enough people anyways. We'll be fine. Where's Steph? - Uh, she forgot her cell phone back in the car. She'll be back in a second. She's walking to the car. Dude! - What's up, brother? Hey, so, which one's my date? - [Man] Oh, you see brown haired girl over there? - You serious? - Fuck yeah, man. (both chuckle) - Oh. So who's the blond girl? - Oh, that's Steph's friend Claudia. (mumbles) I'm gonna get them over. Hey guys, you come here. Check this out. - Hello. Hi, I'm Terry. - Susan. Nice to meet you, Terry. - Likewise, Susan. So you wanna go sit down? - Sure. (chuckles) - Anything to see around here? - The trail you guys just came up is the only one in and out of the parking lot. Every other trail will take you to a dead end or it twists and turns. So I wouldn't go on a walk by yourself or anything. But yeah, that's basically the main in and out trail. - Seriously? - Yeah. I mean, it's nice out here. Just not much to see. You know? - Stevens wrecked right over there, and I saw the Bigfoot probably right about there. - Little kid's sneaker. - That could have come from anybody. - Could be. How many little kids' sneakers you know have a long, thick hair attached to it that smells like shit? - Probably not too many. - [Nick] Not too many. - Looks like he went through here. I'm gonna follow this trail up, see what else I can find. - Hank, it might be a little dangerous. (gun clicks) - [Hank] I'll be fine. - Hank! Do yourself a favor. Take that. - Thanks. Talk to you in a bit. - You got it. (grunts softly) (creature grunts) (creature grunts loudly) (creature roars) (creature huffs) (creature growls) (dramatic music) - Oh, shit! (creature roars) (creature growls) (creature huffs softly) (suspenseful music) - Holy shit! Benson, this is Hank. I'm about a mile up the trail here, and I just came across a dead guy hanging about 10 feet up in a tree with a branch through his chest. - [Tom Through Phone] Me and Nick are on our way. (creature grunts softly) (creature grunts agitatedly) (creature grunts sadly) - Hank, what you got? - Right there. - God. - Yeah, that's John. - You know that guy? - Yeah. - I gotta go back to the car, go call his wife. - I'm gonna follow this trail, see where this end goes. - All right, I'll just stay here. (door clatters) (raps sharply on door) - Can I help you? (Tommy sobs softly) What happened? - I was taken by a big creature from my house last night, and I just got away. - Your name Tommy Jones? - Yes, sir. How did you know? - You're all over the news, sonny. Come on in here. Now, let's come on in here. We gotta get ahold of some folks. I know they're gonna be real happy to know that you're okay. I'll bet you're really hungry. Sit down here and have a seat. We'll get you something to eat in a minute. I gotta make a call. Yes, ma'am, my name is Dan Jones. That boy that's been missing, well, he just showed up at church on Brewer Boulevard. All right, thank you. Okay, buddy, they're sending somebody over here right now, pick you up, take you home. - Thanks, could I call my mom? I'm sure she's awful worried about me. - You sure can. Come on over here and let's make that call. (indistinct chattering) (leaves rustling) - Hey, whoa, whoa. Did you guys hear that? - Yeah, I heard something. (rustling) (girl speaks indistinctly) - Hell with it, I'll go see what it is. Anybody wanna come with me? How about you, sweetheart? - [Man] Screw that shit. - Wuss. Frankie, come on. (tense, suspenseful music) (boy roars) (laughs) - Dude, that's some fucking funny shit, right? - No, you're a fucking asshole. - Hey dude, that was fucking funny, shut the fuck up. (boys talk over each other) (boys laugh) Where are you guys going? - Oh, we're just gonna take a little walk. - All right. - Watch out for the grass man! - Yeah? - [Man] Yeah, I'll do that. - So do you wanna go for a walk, too? - Where? - I don't know, maybe somewhere a little more private, I guess. - Sure. - You guys heading out? - Yeah. Beautiful night for a walk. - [Susan] Steph, do you and Frankie wanna come too? - Yeah-- - I think we're actually just gonna hang here. All right, babe. - Yeah, just go on, have a nice walk. - [Susan] See you guys later. - Why did you do that? That was so mean? - What? Give them some time to get to know each other. - Yeah, I'm sure that's why. - Well, it is. - Yeah, whatever, Frankie. - Sure are a lot of cars out here tonight. - Yeah, this event does well every year. I used to come here when I was a kid. - They ever give you any trouble? - These kids? No. They're all good kids. - It's awfully quiet. Little too quiet. - Yeah. Well, let's just hang out here just a little bit longer. See what happens. - Wanna sit here and talk a little more? - Sure, why not? - Do you mind if I kiss you? - Sure. (smooching and sighing) You're a good kisser, Gary. - You're not so bad yourself, Susan. (Susan mumbles softly) (both chuckle softly) Do you wanna do something else? - I thought you'd never ask. (both pant) Wait, did you hear that? - Hear what? - What was that sound? - It's probably just animals or something. - There's animals out here? - Yeah, just nothing that can hurt you. - Okay, sounds like whatever it is is gone anyway. - Good. Now, where were we? - We were right about here? (deep breathing) Wait, what is that smell? - Whoa, I don't know. Oh! (Susan gags and coughs) - So, was it you? - (chuckles) It was you. (creature growls) (screams) (Susan gags and coughs) - That sounded like Susan. - Uh, Terry probably jumped out and scared her. Look, it's nothing to worry about, babe. - I don't know, that scream sounded really weird. (creature huffs) - You hear that? - I sure did. - Yeah. Come on, guys, let's go. - Go! (creature huffs softly) - Ew, what is that smell? - Oh! I don't know what that smell is. (creature huffs softly) Liz? Get ready to run. - What is it? - Just get ready. (exiting rock music) (creature growls) (Liz screams) (creature roars) (creature huffs) (creature grunts and growls) Whoa, shit! (creature grunts and growls) - [Liz] No, please no! (creature roars) - Police department! - [Boy] Watch out, there's a Bigfoot over there! - [Girl] My God, what do I do? (creature roars) (shots blast) (creature grunts) (groans) - Nick, are you okay? - [Nick] Son of a bitch! (mutters) - You guys, you gotta get me some duct tape or some sticks, (Nick groans) rags, something like that. Go, quick, quick, quick, quick. - Here. - Now get me some sticks, come on! Don't stand there. (tape rips) - Here you go, sir. - Here you go. All right, Nick. I'm gonna set your leg. I'm not gonna lie to you. It's gonna hurt like a bitch, okay? - Yeah. - All right, here we go. (Nick groans) Sorry about that, buddy. (Nick groans) Hang on. (Nick groans) Here we go. That's good. That's done. (creature huffs) (creature roars) - It's back, guys. - All right, everybody, stay calm. Nick, I gotta call this in. Where's the radio? - I must have dropped it when it threw me. - Damn, Elwood. - I don't hear any more. - No, it's just toying with us. - Hey, how many kids are up here? - Uh, 10, but four are still missing. - Can't worry about that right now. The creature's out here and it's not going anywhere. I haven't been up on this hill for years. Does anybody know if there's another way off this hill? - No, just the path you all came up. Terry knows other ways, but we can't find him. (exhales sharply) - I guess we're just gonna have to find a way with that path. (creature huffs) - I do know one thing for sure. Something really pissed that thing off, for it to go after humans like this. It's like it's on a vendetta. - How long ago did it attack you guys? - Not a long time ago. About an hour ago. - Did you get a good hit when you shot it? - I definitely hit it once. Might have missed the other times. - If it's wounded, we'll definitely have a better chance of getting out of here alive. But you guys saw that thing, it's huge. - All right, guys, everybody try and stay calm, okay? The less frantic, the better. Just stay cool. We'll all get off this hill alive. - Sounds good to me. - Nick, you okay to do this? - Time to find out. - Couple of you guys help the ranger down the hill? - Yeah, no problem. Come on, Char. (Nick grunts) Sorry, sir. - [Nick] No, that's all right. Thanks for the help. - [Boy] Let's do it. (creature roars, kids scream) (creature huffs) (Nick groans) - That's the way. Yeah, right there. You okay, man? - No, I'm not okay, but hey, Jimmy, do you have a cell phone? - Yeah, yeah. Here. Hey, I'm gonna go check on the rest of 'em, make sure they're all right. - Yeah, be careful. - Yeah. - Yeah, dispatch, this is Ranger Nick Thomas. I'm gonna need some emergency service vehicles sent up to the Buck Doll Hill camp-out parking lot. If we can get those on the fly. - What is the state of emergency, sir? - My colleagues and I were attacked by a Bigfoot. - Did you say a Bigfoot? Are you sure? - I know. Just please, we need an ambulance here ASAP. - Sir, they're on their way. I told the authorities to use caution. Can I ask who your colleagues are? - Um, yeah, we've got a Bigfoot researcher and a detective. - (sighs) Oh no, Tom. - You know Detective Benson? - Yes, I do. Is he okay? - As of right now. I don't know. Okay, please keep me informed, Ranger Thomas. - No problem. (sighs) (suspenseful music) - What do you think our next move is? - I don't know, I'm thinking. - [Dispatch] Unit 312 central, we have a report of some type of animal attack near the old gym on Buck Doll Hill with multiple fatalities. - We gotta get over there. - You're darn tootin'. - Shit. - Yeah, hey Marilynn. Babe, I'm sorry about tonight. No, everything's fine. No, you wouldn't even believe it. But yeah, I'm up by the camp-out parking lot up near Buck Doll Hill. No, don't come up here, we've got this all taken care of. But I'm sorry about the. No. Hey, I gotta talk to you. Let me give you a call back later. Bye. (creature growls and huffs) - Ranger! Hey, we heard on the radio. Are you okay? - Dang, ranger, your leg is jacked. - It's fucking broke, man. - They say we're going live mic. All right, what the heck? Going live in five, four, three, (huffs) two. Good evening. Action News reporter Steve Darnell reporting live from what is rumored to be a scene of horrors. I'm in normally tranquil Buckland, just off Highway 83. If what sources are reporting is true, it is a scene of gargantuan animal violence and murder. - Holy moly. Man, you're, (stutters) you're drooling, man. - Come on, you guys, that's my girlfriend. - Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me what's going on here? - No, come on, man. I'm dealing with this. Hey, you wanna know something about the Bigfoot, talk to those guys. Not me, them. - Right, thank you so much. - Sir, hi, can't seem to grab a sheriff or a law enforcement. Can you tell me what's going on here? - Yeah, uh-- - Let me, let me talk to you. Hi, yes, my name is Brian Johnson and this is my business partner Duane McCoy. First of all, I wanna offer prayers and condolences to the families of all those who've lost their lives. We have people up here who've literally been torn to bits. - Torn to bits. By what, did they say? - Uh, that would be by Bigfoot, sir, the Bigfoot. Possible even Bigfeet, I kid you not. - We got it on film, secretly hidden away. - Goddamn, Duane, you old turd. - There you have it, folks. I'm gonna try to get closer to speak to one of the first responders or hopefully law enforcement as we are live on scene. - Actually, we were first on scene, sir. First to see the thing and first to capture the beast on film. - Wait a minute. Why are you talking to these losers? - Hey, get the fuck out of here. - Go! - Dumbass! - Fellas, we can't do that. No f-bombs, please, we're live on air. I am so sorry, ladies and gentlemen. - I wanna apologize for my partner, sir. He's very sensitive and protective. We're actually two documentary filmmakers. We have historical footage. All inquiries call T-U-R-K-E-Y-S-H-O-T, Turkeyshot. The area code and phone number goes directly to our office. - And our website is temporary down, a little bit overloaded. But it will be updated soon. - All moneyed inquiries, call Turkeyshot. This footage will blow your fucking mind! - Okay, all right, thank you. Thank you. Officer! - [Brian] Good job! - Look, there's the detective and Hank. (Hank huffs and grunts softly) (creature roars) (second creature roars) (both creatures roar) (both creatures roar) (creature roars) (creature roars) (creature howls) (creature roars) (creatures howl and roar) (up-tempo rock music)
