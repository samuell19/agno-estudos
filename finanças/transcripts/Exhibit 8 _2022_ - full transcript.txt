[pulsing electronic music] [projector whirring] [static crackling] [ominous instrumental music] [footsteps crunching on leaves] [man humming faintly] [indistinct talking] [inaudible] [speaking indistinctly in Dutch] [cameraman speaking in Dutch] [man screaming] [speaking in Spanish] Good morning. It's a rainy day, but not for me. For me, actually, the sun is shining in my heart. [speaking in Spanish] You know why? I will tell you why. I have such an exciting news today. Because after weeks and weeks of standstill it's time. You know what? We are shooting today. Let me show you. Look at this sweetheart over here. ♪ Telelucha ♪ You like it? Yes?! Yes?! And what about this one? Ah! You did not know that, eh? We are going to do some drone time, too. So, we are meeting with this girl Aisha. When I heard about her story, I immediately reached out to her and she has agreed for me to help her document it. Her story is a really great one to tell. Obviously it is not great. The story about her brother is such an important one to tell. So, off we go. We're going to meet Aisha. [muttering] [exclaims] -Hey, Elias! -Aisha. -Hi. -Hello. [Elias] I-- I'm sorry, I-- -Flat? I am sorry, I don't... -Come on. My Dutch is really bad, because... I don't live here for so long, so... I don't speak Dutch. Just a few words. [train rumbling] How are you going to edit if you don't speak Dutch? I was wondering... Maybe in English? Do everything in English? Yeah. Is that a problem? [Aisha laughs] If that's good with you? Eh... Yes. -Yes, why not. -Great. Meanwhile you can teach me some new words. Okay. No, it's no problem. Hello, nice to meet you. I'm sorry? Um... -What? -We have to go. Oh... You...? -She's not your grandmother? -No. She's my neighbor. She's been alone, so I take care of her a bit. You know? I just help her out. This is my place. Come on. I thought it was your grandmother. No. [laughs] -Is it yours, all this stuff? -No, it is rentals. I am going to hide your microphone a little. -Because otherwise... -Yeah. I am ready. How about you? I am super ready! No, of course not. I'm a bit nervous. I'm sorry. I'm a bit bad on camera. Oh no, that's what everyone says. You just relax and we will take it from there. Okay. Um... Maybe we should take a coffee break. -Sugar? -Just sugar, a little. So... When Adin and I arrived here we were alone. I was four. And he was 13. [Elias] I imagine you hardly have any memories of him. [Aisha] No, I do remember some things. Yes, I have some memories. I remember him taking me to the forest. And I also remember him reading to me from these Dutch books... that they gave us. And him telling me what he thought the stories were about. Because neither of us could understand them or read Dutch, you know? He was sweet. [solemn music] He was funny, too. We were in a shelter for almost two years. And, um... We were about to be adopted. A couple of weeks before, Adin... He, uh... He disappeared. He just vanished? Yeah. Basically. You know, I am always thinking where he is and what he is doing. And if he is alive or... He is always in the... The back of my mind, you know? [Elias] That looks good. I am still putting in the final touches, but... Many people have already seen it. -Oh, wow. -Yeah. You never know... [traffic din] -[Aisha] It's good? -Yeah. -Can you see the camera? -No. Absolutely not. -[Aisha] Are you sure? -I'm sure. It's perfect. You can see almost everything. -Yeah? -This is good footage. -Are you excited? -I am a bit nervous. -I am fine. -They won't see anything. [Aisha] Okay, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. I've been here many times before, you know? Mind your step. Well... There haven't been any new developments, I'm afraid, Ms. Divas. -Dinev. -Dinev. But are you going to find out what happened? Are you still doing anything about it? The thing is... Yeah... The problem with these people is that... They, um... almost always go into crime. Another possibility could be that he just went back to, eh... Where are you guys from? I am from Bosnia. Well, that he just went back to Bosnia. But we obviously don't have any jurisdiction there, so, yes... Well, that isn't really our country's responsibility, is it? Okay. Well, okay. -Thanks for the information. -No problem. Thank you. -Yeah. -All right. Well... -[Elias] This is it? -[Aisha] Yes. -[Elias] This is it? -[Aisha] Yes, let's go. [Elias] This is it? -[Elias] That was so fucked up. -Well... I mean, it doesn't always seem super important to them... when I ask them about Adin. "Not this country's responsibility." If this was some Dutch kid called Hans or some shit like that and he disappeared overnight... it would be a national trauma. [FaceTime notification ringing] -Hello, hello. -[Aisha] Hey, Karl. This is Elias, the film maker I told you about. -Hello, Mr. Den Akker. -Hi, nice to meet you, Elias. -Please call me Karl. -Okay. Hi, Karl. I sent you a message, because I work at the Wilgenburg Refugee Centre... where you and your brother used to stay. Oh! Wow... Okay. Your story really moved me, you know. Yeah. Elias, I understand you are making a documentary on Adin? Yes, sir, that is the plan. -Yeah. -Great. I used to be a photographer myself. Oh, wow. What kind? I was a war photographer. I have been out of the game for a long time, though. But it helps me connect to many of the people that come through here. I have seen some of what they have seen. I still feel like I can do something good. -Oh. -Yes. -Yes. -That's nice. That's great. So you are aware of the quest we are on? Yes. I've already spoken to my boss, Robert Duikman. He is the director of the centre. He would like to invite you to come by if you like. [Karl] Always welcome. [sighs] Great. -Right? -Yeah. Yeah, this is fantastic. Yeah. -This is really great, Aisha. -Yeah, I will think about it. What is there to think about? I don't know. It's just, eh... I've never been back to that place. Never? -No. -So? You cannot really avoid... you know, going back to that place to go look for your brother. [tense music] [Elias] Are you all right? [Aisha] I don't know. I haven't talked about this for a long time. It's just, for years I couldn't stop thinking about Adin. But that made me feel so empty inside, you know? I forced myself to... just give up hope. I just couldn't live like that. [Elias] And now it's all coming back? [Aisha] Not just him. It's all of it. The escape, the centre... I just have so little memories of that place. It's so weird. Like I was there only for hours instead of years. Maybe I forgot those things for a reason. All right, Elias here for Telelucha... [speaking in Spanish] Listen guys, I have some very sad news for you guys. Because, well, I haven't spoken to Aisha in a couple of days. Not since she has not agreed to come with the invitation from Karl. It's a pity, because it's such an important search and I guess, well, guys, the project is off. No, it's not! Oh my god. -How are you, Aisha? -I'm good. -You are such a great actor. -Thank you. Applause! -You drive, I shoot? -Okay. All right. Perfect! All right, let's go. [car rumbling] [suspenseful music] [Aisha] Do you remember Maddie McCann? [Elias] The little girl that went missing? [Aisha] Yeah, exactly. -In Portugal. -Yeah, I remember. She was big news. [Aisha] Everyone in the world knew her face. On TV every day. In every newspaper. But it's how it should always be, right? With every kid that just disappears like that. [Elias] Yeah. [Aisha] I think I probably remember Maddie's face... better than I remember Adin's. [Elias] Did they ever find her? [Aisha] No. No. So much stuff. Let's go. Sorry. There is no food. She brings us some food. [clock ticking] [ominous music] [dog barking in distance] ♪ [camera beeps] [static crackling] [Aisha] Of course I'm scared, Elias. I am scared something horrible happened to Adin. But... Sometimes I think... Maybe Adin didn't disappear. Maybe he just left. Because he wanted a life for himself. Maybe he just abandoned me. That idea scares me the most, you know? [Elias] I'm really sorry about this happening to you. I think you are really brave. [Aisha] Thanks. [camera buzzing and crackling] [eerie music] [camera shutter flashes] [car rumbling] [button beeping] Hello? Aisha Dinev here. We come for Karl den Akker. [door buzzing] -[Aisha] Hey. -Hello. How are you? -Good. -Nice to meet you. -[Elias] Nice to meet you. -[Aisha] Yeah. You can shoot whatever you like. The management will have to see the final cut... and be able to make objections. Okay? -Sure. -Yes. I am sure they will be minimal. So, don't you worry. This is the Wilgenburg Refugee Centre, where I work as a, uh... -Janitor? -Yes! As a janitor. Here are the people sleeping. [woman speaking foreign language] [Aisha] What? -[Elias] Is that Bosnian? -I am so very sorry. But I also should have mentioned that we need to get some kind of permission... before we talk to the guests here. Silence, please. Come on, let's go. -[Elias] What did she say? -I really don't know. I don't understand her. [eerie music] [Elias] Did you recognize it here? [Aisha] No. Not really. I guess what I remember is what it felt like. Or how it just didn't feel like anything, you know? I don't know, it's a bit hard to explain, but... [Elias] Actually, it's not so difficult to understand. It was very similar for me, so... Sometimes it's still hard to believe that I am... really here now. You know? Yeah. ♪ [Karl] After you've talked to Robert there will be plenty of time for us to explore the centre. So, if you just wait here for a bit. [Aisha] Okay. Yeah. Hey. Wow. [boy screaming] [Robert] Easy, kid! -Ho! -Sorry. [Aisha] Sorry. [Robert] He's okay. So, hi. I'm Robert. I run this safe haven. We try to keep everything calm and quiet, but sometimes it can be a bit hectic. -Is he okay? -Yes, he's okay. He's okay. He is with Karl. Come on. The people that come through here, they, uh... they need stable conditions. After all they've been through. They can go anywhere? Yes. Yes. Yes, of course. We are not a prison. That's a very important privilege. But they don't always come back, though? When they go somewhere? [stammering] Shall we go outside? Yes, okay. And, um... What about the kids? Kids? Yeah, the other kids that go missing. Oh. Well... When minors leave, we have the policy to inform the police. Yes, but when I asked the police about Adin... Adin? Who? Uh, my brother. Adin Dinev. We came here together, but he has been missing basically ever since. No. Look. [Robert clearing throat] -This is your brother? -Yeah. [Robert] Mm. Wow. I'm sorry. -Like I said, a police matter. -You don't remember him? I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Thank you. [Elias] So you are saying you are sorry to hear it and that's it? Like I said, We are not a prison. Everyone is free to vanish if they please. [Elias] What if it was your son that would just vanish. Would you assume he just packed up and left? After going through hell coming here in the first place? That's bullshit. You're lying. Okay. [Elias] Okay what? -End of discussion. -[Elias] End of discussion. So you're seriously not going to talk to us? You recognize him. Is something wrong? -Yes, he is a liar. -Elias. -Come on, outside. -No! -You recognize him. I saw it. -Keep your distance. I would really keep your distance. Or you are going to make me vanish? -[Robert growling] -[Elias] No, no, no! [Elias] Easy, I'm going. Go! [Elias swearing in Spanish] -[Elias] Where's my camera? -[Aisha] Here. -[Elias] You have it? -[Aisha] Yeah. Is it all right? -Are you okay? -[Aisha] Yeah. You? -Is the camera okay? -Yes. I don't know. You know he bit me! What the fuck, Elias. -What? -Jesus. What? He bit me! I hope the asshole guard didn't break the skin. Do I have blood? Do I have blood? [swearing in Spanish] He has the mic. He's still mic'd. Come. Aisha, come, please. Come. He is still talking. -He's mic'd. -Give it to me. -Could you listen? -Yes. What is he saying? [Robert speaking indistinctly] They're talking about us. [Aisha] About Adin. [Elias] Come on! Where are you? Yes, I've got him. Look, look, look, look, look! [Aisha] Okay, Marcussen. We need to look for him. -[Aisha] Who is he talking to? -Bye. -[Aisha] Okay. -[Elias] Asshole. [Aisha] Marcussen, we need to look for him. [Elias] Anything? -Yeah, one hit. -It's from the local newspaper. -What does it say? He was arrested because he may have had something to do with the missing people in town. -[Elias] Weird looking guy. -I know, man. -[Elias] This was in '99? -Yes, that is what it says. Never heard of any Marcussen. No one ever told me anything about this. -Wow. -What? He literally died the next day, July 10, 1999. Jesus! Really? Really? Marcussen, yeah. Just a weird kid that became a weird man. But harmless. One day, one of our officers, he's out in the woods. And he runs into Marcussen acting all weird and stuff. And he was covering some hole in the ground. So we take him back to the station to find out what he was doing out there. But he won't say a word. Nothing. We send some guys and they just find his dead dog buried right there. In the forest. So false alarm. But then we go tell him he can go home. And we find the poor guy hanging. I guess he couldn't live without that dog. Right? [Elias] Would it be possible to see the paperwork? I wish, I wish. Uh, big fire here in '05, -it destroyed all of that. -That is terrible. Yeah. Oh, hey. This wouldn't have anything to do with that yugo that went missing back then, would it? -[Elias] Yugo? -You mean my brother? Look, I pulled this from the archives for you. We had it up when he vanished. So, um, yeah, it might trigger some folks' memories. [Aisha] Adin. [Elias] Are you okay? [Elias] "That yugo"? -What? -[Elias] Yugo. What the policewoman said. -About Adin. -Oh, that. How do you feel about that? You could have said something. What's the point? She helped us, didn't she? [Elias] You need to stand up. Call these people out. Why? We need these people to work with us. That doesn't matter. You shouldn't let that stuff slide. I just don't like confronting people, okay. [Elias] So learn. [Aisha scoffs] [Elias] Thank you. [clock ticking] [suspenseful music] ♪ [door creaking] [drone buzzing] -[Elias] No! No. -[Aisha] What? -[Elias] It crashed. -[Aisha] What? -It crashed. It... -What happened? I don't know. A bird or some... A bird or something. [Aisha] Okay. Just... Just give me. I am going to look for it. Wait here. [ominous music] [Aisha] Did you find it? [Elias] No! The GPS is off. It is really weird, because it is almost impossible. Even with a crash like that it is impossible. -[Aisha] I am sorry. -They better not have broke it. If anyone... Jesus, man, it's a rental. [phone ringing] [Aisha] Hey, Karl, Aisha and Elias here. We really wanted to say sorry for all the fuss today. [Karl] Don't worry. I understand this is all very sensitive to you. Elias is standing in front of me and he also apologizes. [Elias] Hey, Mr. Den Akker. Sorry for today. Call me Karl, Elias. Call me Karl. -Sorry, Karl, for today. -I'm so sorry. We really hope we didn't get you into trouble, Karl. -Don't worry about me, please. -Yeah. -[Karl] Listen. -Yes. [Karl] I would still like to help you. I am on your side, so to speak. It is very important to me that you know that. Um, we were actually wondering if you knew anything about Andreas Marcussen. [Karl] Why? Uh, we just found an old article about him from the local newspaper here. It just seems like a lead. Right? The police told us about the fire in the station... that destroyed all the paperwork they had on him. [tense music] [Karl] They told you that? [Karl on phone in video] They told you that? Yeah. [Karl sighing] [Karl] Let's meet somewhere. No camera. Please. Okay. [Elias] Let's get the GoPro. [suspenseful music] -Here he is. -Yes, it's on? -[Elias] Let's do it. -Okay. [Karl] Guys, um... I don't want to get you into trouble. [Elias] There was a fire, wasn't there? There was. I just don't think they lost all the evidence they had on Marcussen. Again, I don't want to make trouble here, but... I do have to warn you. [Aisha] What? -[Elias] Why? -[Karl] Not everybody here can be trusted to tell the truth. [Elias] Like Robert, you mean? [Karl] Look... I am not sure what happened. But the officer you spoke to... told me those files were stolen. Before the fire. She once told me... she strongly suspected Robert. [Elias] Okay. You ready? Mm-hmm. -Yeah. -[Elias] Let's go. Hello? No, sorry. My name is Aisha Dinev and, um... Elias, you are freaking me out. Do you really think this is necessary? Just do it. My name is Aisha Dinev and the one that's filming me is Elias Fernandez. We are investigating the disappearance of my brother, Adin Dinev, 25 years ago. We are about to enter the house of Robert Duikman. [Elias] Here. [Elias] You know this is a bad idea, right? Yes. [Elias] What do we do if we get caught? You know we fit the profile. The police will be very happy with that. If we get caught, I will tell them it was my idea. Okay? I swear. [Elias] I don't think that would make a difference. Jesus! Take this. [objects clattering] [tense music] -Is he gone? -[Elias] Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. He's gone, he's gone. [Elias] Okay, let's go. [door creaking] [Aisha] Just keep looking. Wait. [Elias] What?

I swear to you. I swear to you it was him in the car. -It was Robert! -Are you sure? Maybe he has, like, a... like a silent alarm or something in his fucking room. [Aisha] Shall we see it? Yeah, let's see it. [Aisha] It doesn't feel like paperwork. [Elias] A tape. It's a tape. [Elias] Where are we going to get a VHS player?

Sixth Sense. [laughs] Why are you filming here? We are actually filming a documentary. Hello. Hi. A documentary. -Sounds interesting. -Yeah. And we're working with some archive footage and we're in need of a VHS player. -And a video recorder. -Oh. [Elias] Do you have any for sale? No, I don't. Not many demands for VHS players these days. Oh, you don't have a video recorder? -No. -I just saw an, um... How do you say it? Um... -You saw a remote control. -Yeah, yeah. We have remote controls, but not for this video recorder. We don't have video recorders. That's okay. It's too bad. Too bad. Next time. Okay, day three. A man who bit me and who films who knows what in his secret room steals police evidence from the so-called innocent guy. Why would he do that? You know I have one at home, you know. -What? -A VHS player. -You want to go back? -Aren't you -a little freaked out? -Yeah. Aren't you just a little freaked out? I am freaked out, but we're here now. We have to do it now. To be honest, once we leave this place I am never coming back. All right, what do you suggest? [Aisha] We've heard how they talk to him when we're not there. He's the janitor. He does not know anything. [Elias] No, we don't know the first thing about him. We don't know if he is a good person or a bad person. [Aisha] Okay, but he only wants to help. Just let the man help. -What's the problem? -[Elias] He is a serious risk. [Aisha] Okay, so what do you suggest? We have been to Robert's place. We broke in. We went to the police, to the asylum. -We are running out of options. -Yeah, all right. Okay, we go there, yeah, we ask him for the VHS player. Yeah? We take it back here and we do not tell him what it is for. Absolutely not. -Okay. -Agreed? Yeah, I agree. Good. Thank you. [Elias] Ju-- -You are impossible. -Here. Yeah? -Okay, here. -Thank you. Oh. -Come in. -[Aisha] Thank you. -Don't mind the mess, please. -Okay. Fine.

Where should we set up the interview? Over there is the best light, I think. Right? [Aisha] Okay. So, did you find any more information on your brother? Um... Yeah, we are still trying to figure out some things -about the Marcussen case. -Just a minute, please, guys. -Yeah, rolling. -Okay. Uh, Karl, I need to ask you... Can you think of any reason Robert might have stolen evidence? Did you find anything? [ominous music] -What do you mean? -Yesterday. Robert sent me this. Not a very clever thing to do, guys. Did you find anything? Yes. We found this. We're searching for a VHS player. Do you have one? No, I don't. Eh, stop. Elias, eh... -[Elias] Sure. -[Karl] Just wait here. -I'll be right back. -[Elias] Sure. [Karl coughs] [whispering] Where is he going? [Elias] I'm still rolling. -Serious? -Yeah. Should we run? I don't know. What if he is making a phone call? I told you not to fucking tell him. [Karl] You know, as a janitor you know every little corner of a place, making your rounds every day.

This one is to put off the alarm. This one is of Robert's office. And this is the one he doesn't even know that I have. [suspenseful music] [keys jangling] [Elias] I-- I don't know, Karl. Why would you do this for us? To be perfectly honest with you... I know something isn't right. I just don't know what.

I found him! -This is him, right? -[Aisha gasps] [Elias] It's him. Okay, wait. Just take it. Wait for me. [crackling camera audio glitching] [ominous music] [Aisha] Oh, my god. Here. This one is for you. I have one too. It's a USB stick. It has everything on it. Everything we filmed. Okay? Put it in your pocket. Don't lose it. [Aisha] There have been so many missing cases since '99. Whatever happened when Marcussen died, it just didn't stop. Look at this woman. -What? -Look at this picture. -We have her on tape, right? -It's the woman from the centre. -Yeah. -Look at the date. That's the day of the interview. Yeah. After she spoke to us, she's been missing. Shit. [people chattering on video] [Aisha] Yeah. Right here. [speaking foreign language] It's her. What language is that even? -Do you have Google Translate? -[Aisha] Yeah. Okay, play it back. [woman speaking foreign language] [Google Translate] Child, listen to me. Run away. Disappear. It's dangerous here. [eerie music] Run away. Disappear. It's dangerous here. Run away. Disappear. It's dangerous here. She tried to warn us. Okay, we have to go. We have to go now. Just...

Did you forget something? -Yeah. -The car won't start. -Oh no. What is wrong? Is there some kind of mechanic in town? Someone quick? -His shop is closed. -Maybe a taxi company? There is a bus. It only goes twice a day. Only once now, if you're lucky. -You can make it. -Okay. It's right over there. -There? -Yes. -Okay. Thank you. -Good luck. -Yeah. [Aisha] How much longer? [Elias] 13 minutes. [electronic notification] The GPS is back on. What? You mean your drone is working again? [Elias] It's here. It's like 500 meters. [Aisha] Are you serious? It's there. It's right there. Okay. So... What? Elias! Are you going in? It's 4 minutes to get it, 4 minutes to come back... and then 4 minutes to spare. So we have time. Come on. If you want to stay, stay. I am going to get it. It has footage. It's important. 8 minutes to spare. Elias! Wait! [unsettling music] Elias... [Elias] It is somewhere around here. Keep looking. Fuck. Someone's there. Who is it? [Aisha] It's Karl. Who is he talking to? [faint conversation] [Aisha gasps] [Aisha] No. -That was Karl. -Let's go. -We have to go help him! -No, the bus is leaving now. No, he's my friend. I have to go help him. [Elias] We call the police. [Aisha] No, no, the police is in on it! What are you talking about. [Elias] Okay, we will call the real police. -When we get home. -No. -We have to go now. -No, no, no. [Aisha] No. Fuck. -Shall we go! -Elias! Elias, think of the film! Okay? Think of what you already filmed. This is dangerous. Aisha, I want to go home. I just want to go home. I thought the truth was so important, right? [music fades] -It's on? -It's on. Okay. Okay. [car idling] [car approaching] Let's go. That's them. Let's go. [both panting] [Elias] Look. Look at that. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Can you see something? Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Christ. Fuck. Don't stop filming. [Elias, repeating] Don't stop filming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Aisha] Don't... [lights flickering on] Oh, no. It's your drone. [Elias] Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. [Aisha] Shit. [gasping emotionally] Oh... [gulping fearfully] [Elias] Wait. Wait for me. Wait for me. -[Aisha whimpering] -[Elias] Wait for me.

[Aisha sobbing] [Elias speaking indistinctly] [chattering in Dutch] Adin. Adin. It is him. [girl chattering in Dutch] [Adin screaming] [man on tape growling] Sorry, I really... Come on, we should go.

Our director has done it again! I have never seen anything like this. [Karl] Thank you. I must say... I couldn't have done it without my friends and family here in town. I think Anja deserves a round of applause. [clapping] As well as Rick! What a perfect performance! Yes, but as we will agree... There is one man who deserves our applause more than any other. Our dear friend, Mr. Andreas Marcussen! [clapping and cheering] Thank you. Thank you. It's clear that my legacy will not die with me. I would like to meet the star. [door creaking] [Karl humming] [Aisha screaming muffledly] [Aisha] Elias! Elias! [spits] Hey! [chattering in Dutch] [Karl] Here we go. -Andreas! -[screaming] [Aisha yelling] [Karl screams] [people screaming, glass shattering] [tense music] [people screaming and shouting in Dutch] [muffled screaming and shouting] [wailing and shouting] [fire crackling] [chaotic shouting and sobbing] Ms. Dinev. I understand you have prepared a statement. Please proceed. Thank you. My name is Aisha Dinev. In reference to what you have just watched... exhibit number 8... I would like to say a few things. As you have now seen... I am responsible for the death of nine people. And there is no doubt whether I am guilty or not. It didn't bring back Elias. And it didn't bring back my brother. But I do believe my crime, for which I am here today... may have saved the lives of countless others. But I know from experience that sometimes when you don't do what is needed nobody else will. Instead, people will allow us to disappear. Because they simply look away. Thank you. [reporter] Today, in the infamous Wilgenburg bloodbath hearings... suspect Aisha Dinev finally broke her silence. Aisha Dinev confessed to numerous accounts of violence after a closed screening of the much-hyped evidence video that has been referred to as exhibit #8. If anything, today's statement made one thing clear: Sentenced or not, Aisha Dinev won't forget. She is still, and will remain, hell-bent on destroying any and all snuff communities that are possibly still out there. Despite her obvious guilt, Dinev has become a media sensation. Sparking thousands to voice their outrage... over the severe charges she faces. Many feel her part has overshadowed the actual horror that took place in Wilgenburg...
