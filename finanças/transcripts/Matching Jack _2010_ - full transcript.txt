How did they do that? Cool! How did she do that? Can you see any strings? Hey, listen, Dad's got to go to his meeting now. Can you pass it on to Mum? But we haven't had the cake yet. No, I know. Look, I've got to pay the bills, haven't I? Dad has to go. Dad has to go. Dad has to go. Dad has to go. I can't do it. He can't do it. He can't do it. He can't do it. Tom's too shy to tell her, Dad. OK, don't worry about it. I'll see you later, OK? See ya. - If it was real Aussie blood... - That's Dad. Hang on, hang on. Where are you? I'm just turning onto the Eastern. The traffic's crazy. Don't forget the sparklers. They're on the bench beside the water bottles. Alright. Yeah, I just didn't see you leave. Oh. Mr. Blonden was about to be cut in two. It was a tense moment. OK, make a wish, honey. I wish that the Ravens would win tomorrow! A man equally at home... designing the award-winning Gordon Institute of New Technology as he is with the exquisite restoration of this iconic Victorian building. Mr. Premier, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Professor David Hagen. We took out the hydrangeas. Apparently they're the ex-wife's favourite flower. She had good taste. And the bride's allergic to lilies. We'll just have to make sure there's some tissues handy, won't we? What time are the photographers coming? Midday. And is this how you want the orchids? Almost. Needs a lot more hyacinth, though. - We'll get onto it right away. - Gotta go. OK. Go, the Ravens. - Looks beautiful! - Thank you. That's it, keep going. That's it. - Come on, Ravens! - Good kick. Well played. Spread around, boys. Pass it. - Good kick, son. Well played. - Go for it! Jack, get in there. Get in there! Hang on. Free kick, free kick. That's OK, Jack. Come on, back in the game. OK, let's go. Spread around, defence. Spread around, spread around. Play on. - Right, play on. - You're OK, you're OK. No problem. Keep going, keep going. I said play on. Free kick now. Hang on a minute. You alright? Shame Linda's not here for this one. Marissa, this man's pooped before half-time. - Yeah, I noticed. You alright, mate? - Yeah. You know what? I'm just gonna drop him in to Doc Reid. We'll see you Tuesday practice. - Take care. - Come on, mate. We try to achieve maximum formal impact with complete unity. The new addition of the memorial hall at Broughton Park demonstrates Harvey's contemporary forms... Dad, we're home. Ah, you did the shopping already. Good. Dr. Reid took some blood and stuck my name on it! Yeah, you were really brave, sweetie. Then the ladies took it in to a psychopath. Pathologist, I suspect. You do look a bit zonked. Pussy, eh? Come on. - What's that all about? - He just got tired at soccer. Doc Reid said he should be fine. They just did some blood tests to be sure. I didn't know you'd be working. - Yep, sorry. I got to take this. - What time's your plane? - I've got to leave in half an hour. - Alright. Hi. Holy shit! Don't swear or blaspheme, mister. There's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us. Should we hurry down to the cellar? Hey, don't interrupt him, Jack. He's working. Dad, there's a comet. Dad! - You've gotta look at this thing! - Sorry, just a sec. Jack, you're supposed to knock, please. But there's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us. Yeah. Due to go past in about 21-26, I think. Now, can I finish this, please? - Yeah. - Good. - Sorry. - Off you go. So the termite guy might swing by this afternoon. Recycling's tomorrow night. Don't forget, please. Yeah, I know. But they reckon that's what killed the dinosaurs. - What, recycling or the termite guy? - A comet like Swift-Tuttle! - Here. You always forget this. - Oh! - Staying in the same place? - Yeah, usual. - I'll bring you back a shower cap. - And I'll have a marmalade. It's gonna miss us by 15 million miles. I think we'll be alright. You don't even like marmalade. Is this a new thing I need to know about, huh? - I love you. - I'll make you that for breakfast. - Travel safe, honey. - See ya! All the combined armed forces designed a weapon that would be fired at Swift-Tuttle just at the right time. Hi. Oh, hello, Dr. Reid. Sure. Yeah, yeah, I'll bring him in this afternoon. As it got closer and closer, the scientists couldn't agree where the comet was going to hit, and if Swift-Tuttle hits us, there'll only be a crater instead of this 'orrible 'ospital! "Horrible hospital". Mum, how long do we have to stay here? Just be one second, darl. Jack's white cell count certainly is abnormally high. We should admit him, keep an eye on him. There's a lot of reasons, aren't there, for a high white cell count? Maybe he's just been overdoing it. We're going to do further tests, of course. We can ascertain what the problem is and then we'll treat him. OK? - You alright, buddy? - Yeah. Almost there. Atlantis Station. - Thank you. - My pleasure. He'll sleep for a while. There you go, buddy. It's your birthday! Gonna party like it's your birthday! Drink Ribena like it's your birthday! Come on, now, it's your birthday! Come on, pick up, for God sakes. Professor David Hagen. I'm sorry I can't take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. David, it's me. Call me. It's urgent. David Hagen, please. Come on, I'm in a hurry. So am I, my friend. Why don't you hire a truck, you git? If you got out of your motor car, that would help, not sitting there sounding your horn, please. Why don't you go back to China? I Korean, you stupid round-eyed Tasmanian. Now, let's not be starting World War III, fellas. Thank you. Now, see what we can achieve when we all work together? This is the Park Royal, isn't it? Well... No, just check again. Professor David Hagen. H-A-G-E-N. No. Thank you. Ho-ho, there he is! The boatswain's mate, always ready to pipe the captain aboard. - Dad, you've finished it! - I was up all night with the frame. The Australian climate plays havoc with the planks. Give me the icy waters of the Solent any day. Right, let's get cracking. Down you go. Yeah. Right. Put this here. It's orgasmic. 'Orgasmic', you say. And what would that mean, exactly? Uh, it's something about food with no bug spray. That would be 'organic'. What's this sailor's name? He must have just arrived. I reckon she could spare us a jib. Ahoy there! How would it be if I trade you my coat? 'Cause sailing away is all those sheets are good for. Sorry, wool makes me itch. Ne'er you mind. Right. Crew in place. Steer ship to starboard. We'll be underpowered for the moment. Ah! There on the horizon. Can you see the magical islands rising for the night? But be sharp, boy. They're likely to vanish in the blink of an eye. Hear me now, dawn spirits of the east. Join us, if you will. Your magic is most welcome and wanted here. Is the father sick too, Mummy? He's just praying, darling. Go back to sleep. I'll get us our own room in the morning. Candle of white, protection of light, free us from fear by day and by night. Candle of white, protection of light, free us from fear by day and by night. - Just meet him there. - Yeah, thanks for that. He's turning the ward into a coven. Yes, I agree about the candles. But we can't conjure up beds we don't have. There's got to be a single room somewhere. We pay top cover for this. Milk run? - I'll go. - No, I'll do it. No, I'll go. You've done enough shopping for this relationship. Why didn't you get the bed by the window? It's nearer to the loo. If you're on Gleevec, you have to piss all the time. What sort of leukaemia do you have? Leukaemia? I don't think I've got that. They haven't told you? You're in a cancer ward. I am? Well, maybe I've just got a bit of leukaemia. Well, there's bad leukaemia and there's really bad leukaemia. That's all. I used to have the really bad one, but they fixed it. - Mum? - Yes, darling? Have I got leukaemia? Yeah, you have, but they're really good at fixing it here. They did say he's a good age for treatment. A good age? Where were you, David? I was calling your phone all weekend. Park Royal told me you weren't even registered there. I know, I'm sorry. There was a mix-up with the reservation. I had to go somewhere else. I just really needed you here. - I know. - Dad? - Dad. - Hello, mister. I can't leave you alone for a minute, can I? Bone marrow transplants used to be a last resort, but with high-risk children, we're finding that transplants - after the initial chemo... are mainly giving positive results. 'High risk'? But my wife just said that he was at a good age. The T cell's a strange fellow. It makes Jack's treatment more tricky. Where are all these amazing breakthroughs we keep hearing about? Stem cell work? Look, I'd say Jack's got a better than even chance of responding well to chemotherapy alone. And with bone marrow transplant, much better odds. Anything less is too risky. "Even chance"? If there's a sibling whose marrow matched, makes the odds much better. - I'm ordering a lumbar puncture. - OK. It'll give us a clearer idea of where we stand. OK. He was such a robust baby. I wonder... Well, I mean, all those paint strippers and flaking paint he used to roll in. - Hey. I've gotta move the car. - Come on, boys. One at a time. Remember where we are. No, no, kids. You can't just walk in there. We have to come sterilise your hands, OK? Jack's been diagnosed with leukaemia. No. It's because she stopped buying red meat. He just needs to eat some liver. No, not anaemia. I said... I said 'leukaemia'. Oh, yeah. He'll be back playing with all of you in no time. - That's great. - That's awesome. That's Finn over there. He sailed out here on a yacht from Ireland. - Oh! - By himself? Yeah! After pirates killed the rest of the crew. Where have you put my cherub? - Hi, Mum. - Hello, darling. Alright, boys. Thanks so much for visiting. Bye, Jack. - We'll see you all soon, OK? - OK. See ya! - Sarah, I'll call you. - Come on, boys. Bye, Jack. Is it lemonade, Gran Cleo? Oh, no, dear. It's from Mrs. Bland up the street. - Is it fizzy? - It's holy water. I'll go and get my cherub some lemonade. Coffees for you and me? Okey-doke. Oh, my! Is that a model of one of the nurses? Oh, no. My dad's making me a figurehead. It looks a bit like my mum before she died. We're going on a sailing trip to some magical islands. Her name's Asiram. She'll be at the head of our vessel. Indeed she is! Oh! Hello. - Oh, hi. - Right. Here we go! I used to be in the Girl Guides. Were you indeed? Then you would know that the bowline is the best knot for mooring. I would. Right. Finally, let's plug this boy in, turn her on... And there she blows. That's cool. Oh-ho-ho, at last! A southerly to start us on our journey. - There's a boat! - This is awesome! - Go on. - Lash it in. Keep it going! - Whoo! - Keep going. She's tacking. She's tacking. Keep pushing. - Aha! - Goin' great. She's tacking! She's tacking. There she goes. Come see our ship over the ocean! Starboard. Starboard. Keep going. Hi, Jack. Hi, Finn. Can we please have a go? - Wait, wait! I'm next. - Westward ho! How cool is this? - Ready, Jack? - Let's go! Oh! Hello! That's it. Come on, boys. That's it! Come on, boys. There she blows. Pull, pull, pull, pull to starboard. - Hey, hey! She's flying. - Oh, this is so cool. Ho-ho! Go on. Ho-ho! Watch that shark. Hey! Keep going! And because of the comet zapper, Swift-Tuttle was banished to space forever! That's a beautiful story, darling. The last bit's on the other card. It's one of Dad's you got? I only took it out of his 'Ready to Use' tray. It's alright. It's OK. This is the best bit. And because the kid saved the world, Pizza Hut gave him 10 million dessert coupons. The end, Episode 1. - Oh! Such an imagination. - You liked it? - Dad! It's a comet. - Yeah. - There you are again. - Come look at this! You're supposed to knock, please. But there's a comet called Swift-Tuttle heading straight for us. Yeah. Due to go past in about 2126, I think. - Can I finish this, please? - Yeah. - Good. - Sorry. Off you go. No, not yet... I just... I've got to work out the best time. I know, I know. Veronica, I'm leaving her. Well, for all his airs and fancy lacework, I thought at the very least he was a decent man. Back in a minute, darling. - Yep. - I'll hold the fort here. If you ever cheat on a girl, I'll kill you. OK? - Sorry. - Off you go. No, not yet... I just... I've got to work out the best time. I know, I know. Veronica, I'm leaving her, OK? I am leaving her. I... And to be perfectly honest, I don't think she'll even notice. Jack's the only thing that matters to her. - Alright. - You OK there, Jack? Nice curving the back there for me, and if you could just push that shoulder up. Good boy. Nice slow breaths. - Then we'll do the mouth. - OK. - And in... two... - That's it, sweetie. - That's it. - That's a boy. Good boy. - Almost done. Almost there. - Good boy. Just takes a little second or so. Good boy. That's it. Nice low breaths. Holy water? - Is she trying to poison him? - Put it down. That's not yours. Who's Veronica? Is she the one that did your editing when I had pneumonia? Is it that one? No idea what you're talking about. How long you been planning it? Planning what? Planning to leave us for her. How long? Marissa, I'm not planning to leave you for... You knew Jack was sick and you just went off to be with her? Listen to me. If you've listened to something out of context, then I'm sorry, but you're wrong. I'm not leaving you for anyone, alright? I'm staying. Stay for Jack. He needs you. - Yes. It's a gale. - Very good. - This one? - 5, fresh breeze? No. Look closely at the crests. Sorry I got you into trouble. Nothing to do with you, kiddo. I did it all by myself, OK? That's a boy. Hi. - Hi, Mum. - I better go, OK? I'll see you later. I love you. I'll head off, OK? Yeah. And that's... that's, er, 11. - A violent storm. - Violent storm. Yeah. 10. Ahoy there. Head sharp aft, right over left, left over right. Send up a flare if you need some help. Radar problem detected. Will investigate. Think about it, Connor... playing cat's cradle isn't going to help our kids make it round Cape Horn. Well, that may well be, but there's a lot more to treating this vile disease than medicine. And I won't have you telling me that Irish linen is a problem for you as well. Come on. Take it. I'll teach you how to sail to the magical islands of the Bean Fionn. They say that a child blessed with a kiss from the Fianna is indestructible. Do you believe this stuff, really? You do? And what about Finn? Do you think it's right for him to believe this... that he's setting sail for some mystical island? All this incredible ritual for nothing? For nothing? No! More so for everything. When the spirit dies, so does the flesh. That won't be happening to my boy Finn. Every human being on earth has two of these... these antigens, these sets, coded so. OK, now, look, don't feel embarrassed about asking questions. Just ask any question you have to ask. So I'll try and get you through it. We've got the HLA-A. That's crucial. That has 24 antigen sites. The HLA-B has 52 antigen sites. Don't be confused by the numbers... HLA-DR... 20 antigens... We can exclude it... We're looking for a sibling... We've got a 25% chance for a match with a donor... We need a blood test, the bone marrow test... We need the genetic test... The unknown... That's the combination... Now, what is crucial is that the immune system will kill any cells with different markers... Because what are we looking for? That's it. We're looking for a... That mixes... This is what we've got... Unfortunately, you have the rare antigens. Ah, David. Quite rare. OK, doesn't put us in a pickle because... OK. How many other women are there? I'm sorry. I've been seeing someone else. I have been. I've been having an affair. And what about all those women in all those houses you worked on? Huh? All those times they called the house and you said there was nothing going on except in my rabid imagination. Marissa, please, don't do this! - All those times you went interstate? - Stop it. How do you know you don't have other children? - How do you know you don't have... - I don't have other children! - Look, stop it! - How do you know that? This isn't the place to talk about this. We'll talk about this at home. Marianne, hi. - Hey, I've got you now! - Marissa. Oh, is that... is that Jeremy? God, is he eight now? Who's there? It's OK, honey. Oh, I don't even know how to say this but... I've got a serious problem that you might be able to help me with. I have to go, so... Is there any chance... that Jeremy could be David's child? - What? What are you talking about? - It's OK. - I already know about the affairs. - Marianne! - It's OK. - Just go, for Christ's sake. - I don't want you here. - Because if he is... Oh! If he is, he could save my child's life. He's not. - Thank God. - I've told you before. - Do you know that for sure? - Don't encourage these people! - She's not selling anything. - Can you get off my property? - Yeah, yeah. I was just going. - Good God! Marissa Hagen. Are you looking for your husband? Well, you're nine years too late. No, er... my boy's... No. I'm not fine. My boy's really sick. Yeah. Jack. Listen, ... Did you have an affair with David in August, 1996? Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet... Janet, Janet, I know! Listen, it doesn't matter to me right now. - Hey, Marissa. - I just... What the hell's happened to my office? Er, no. It's David. You know, Janet, I think you should talk to him about this. It might be a bit easier. - What are you doing? - Janet de Cosi. I don't want to talk to Janet. You're crazy. Listen, Janet, all I need to know... - Are either of your kids his? - For God's sake. Oh, for God's sake! Hang up the phone. He wore a condom. - Gee. How responsible of him. - Hang up the phone. Hang up. This is so fucking stupid. What are you doing? You have gone out of your mind. I'm having real problems with these numbers here, you know? It's like you called this one number in June over and over and over again. - I was working with these people. - Then here at 4:00 am? What were you doing? Don't you think we need to focus on the main thing at the moment in our lives, which is Jack? - Oh! Are you talking about Jack? - Yes, I'm talking about... You mean Jack who had to listen to his dad... talking to some whore on the phone? Look, I'm sorry... Is that what you're talking about, while he's laying in bed with leukaemia? I am sorry he had to listen to that. I am sorry! I will live with that, OK, for the rest of my life! I mean, wh...? What is this? What is this?! What is this shit?! What are we meant to do now?.! - I understand. - Get off me! - I understand what you're... - Oh, do you understand? - Yes! - Oh, really? Because this is about Jack, OK? And Jack is what we have to be focusing on now. What do you think I'm doing?! What do you think I'm doing?! What do you think I'm doing?! What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! - Calm down. - Have you seen what I'm doing?! I love you. I love you. I love you. I'm so sorry. I understand. Just get off me. We're done. OK? Get out of the house. Fully sick! - Ta-da! - Yay! - OK, which hat? - That one. - This one? - Yeah! This one? ♪ Ha, ha! ♪ Hey-hey, Finn. Look. All finished and ready for the voyage ahead, eh? - What do you think, boys? - Cool! - Yeah. Beautiful. - She's beautiful. - Yes. Wow. Cool. - Awesome. Awesome. - Alright, boys. Bedtime. - Come on. Out, out, out. Don't let those bedbugs bite. Er, your boots - are they on the wrong feet? Ah, yes. You see, it's Thursday. Eh, Finn? Finn? Mr O'Brien, could we have a word, please? Aye, aye, Captain. Hi. Have you seen Connor? Thank you. Connor? Connor? The leukocytes are way up. They can't control them. What does that mean? Don't make me say it. Oh, God. Connor, I thought he was... Just leave me alone, will you? Yeah, OK. - If there's anything... - For God's sake, woman! OK. OK. Jasmine? The flowers will make everything OK. Well, fluids are important. Finn! No... No! - No! - OK. - Go away! - OK. Come here, come here. It's OK. - No. - It's OK. Come here. It's OK. Come on. Come on. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK, Finn. It's OK. It's OK. I know, I know. It's OK. It's OK. - It's OK. - I don't want to die. Of course not. Of course not. I'm scared. Finn, of course you're scared. - I'm scared too. - No. But you're not dying. Listen, I think all of us fear stuff that we don't know about. What I do know is this... that the islands of Bean Fionn are where your dear mother is. She's waiting there for you. Now, maybe you'll get better. Maybe you'll be crook for ages. Whatever it is, I'm here with you. We'll do this thing together. And when the time comes, we'll go to those islands. And maybe I'll take you. Or maybe your mummy will take you. Either way, you'll not be alone. Do you hear me? You will not be alone. Come here. Come here. You are a brave, brave soul. You know you were named after the son of Muirne, head of the Fianna. And the bravest, the bravest of all... was Finn. It's OK. It's OK. I know, son. I know. I know. I know. Yes? - Hi. - Hi. Sorry. I was just admiring your renovation. - I mean, your house. - Oh, thank you. My husband, David Hagen, helped you with the heritage issues. Ah. David? David, could you go inside, please? - Now. - Your son's name is David? David, inside now. Yes. I quite like the name. I have to go. I have to get him to swimming. I just want a quick word. My husband was here about 10 years ago. I can't help noticing that your son appears to be about 9 or 10. - Is that right? - What are you doing here? I even notice that his face is sort of similar to David's. I'm sorry. I don't know what you want but I'm in a hurry. My son has leukaemia. He needs a bone marrow transplant. - You must be out of your mind. - Please. Coming here to my home? The donor has to have the same antigens as my husband and that means he has to be a sibling. He's not David's child. He told me you were unstable. I'm unstable? Wait. Wait a minute! Please! Dad... I can feed myself. OK. Can I see you for a minute? Hey, Finn. Finn! Guess what me and my dad are doing on Saturday. We're going to the circus. They have a special one here for all the kids! They're gonna have clowns and acrobats. And they might even have animals. And a guy who eats fire. I saw him on the poster yesterday. Please come, Finn. It won't be any fun without you. OK. Yes! I'll do room 12. Oh, OK. Thanks. Hi there. Mr. O'Brien. - Oh, look, I am so sorry about... - No, don't worry. And the report says I accidentally dropped my bowling ball down the stairs and it went through the window. Bad luck. - Thanks. - OK. My trolley! Connor! Jump in! Oh, hello. Put her in the back. Got it? - She's not gonna fit. - Tie her on the roof. There's rope. Right. Saved by the queen of the waters. Shut up or I'll crash. Where to? My boat's moored down at Williamstown. Oh, yeah, good. My shop's down that way. You've got a boat? You've got a shop? I'm going to be very preoccupied for a while. Yeah, of course. You should be with Jack. I mean, we could see each other again once I've got him through this. OK. David, I'm pregnant. Odd, isn't it? We gave it less thought than two 16-year-olds in the back seat of a car in Albert Park. You're joking. That's great. That's great! Obviously I've thought a lot about this and what with everything going on with Jack and us... No, no, no, no. You can't... you can't worry about that. - I don't think we should have the baby. - Well, let's talk about it. I don't think there's anything to talk about. - As parents. - We never talked about being parents. A lot of people don't discuss that and that just happens. David, it's you and me. It was about us having fun. - Veronica, please. - It was never about being parents. It could be a match for Jack. - For Jack? - Yeah. - Is that what this is about? - No, that's not what this is about. What, you want a baby so you can have some spare parts for your sick child? Oh, that's a disgusting thing to say. It's my boy's life, OK? And no, our baby... Come on. Sweetheart, our baby would be our baby, OK? It just so happens that he or she might also be a match for my boy. - I've made up my mind. - Can we please think about this? Can you please just go? - Amazing. - Ah. Gosh. Mary Hay. A wooden bark of 258 tons. She went down on Steeple Rock in the fog, didn't you? - You made all of these. - No, no. I copied them. There's no art in that. Purely for money. Fortunately, there are people out there with more money than sense. Oh, she is stunning. Oh, she's off the square rigger 'Britannia'. A handsome woman. Certainly ready for the water. - Careful, careful! - I got it, I got it, I got it. - Let it go. - You got it? - I got it. - OK. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I don't suppose I could interest you in sharing a nice pot of tea. No. I'll be getting back. OK. Er, how are you going to get that on the boat? That's a good point. Hello, girls. The boat felt empty without Finn so I made Nuala here to dine with at supper, then I felt bad about leaving her on her own so much so I made my Fair Midhir. Oh, they must have some great chats about salt-resistant shampoo. Listen, you're the first woman aboard that can hold her own cup. Tea. Does the boat ever leak? Oh, all the time. A constant reminder as to who's the boss. I think I'm more of a city girl. Terra firma - much more appealing. Mummy. Mummy! Mum. Mummy! Your mum's not here. And your gran's snoring. What's the matter? My... my hands are tingling. I can't move them. I wouldn't worry yourself. It's just a calcium drop. It happens 'cause of the chemo. Yeah. But now it's happening to my feet. Yeah. It's definitely a calcium drop. Could I die from calcium drop? No. And you're definitely not dying now. You know, people, they... they stop being bossy... talk to a kid sort of differently around here 'cause they're gonna die. Do you know they get their own PlayStation 3? And first choice of DVDs. And face it, no-one except your gran is making any special fuss over you. Finn, is there any way of getting your own PlayStation... that's a bit less than dying? I haven't heard of it. I've got to go. I've got a dentist appointment. - His mummy will be here soon. - OK. Jack's X-ray's at 8:00. I really need to get back. You'll be able to get a signal at the boatshed. I can't believe this. Half an hour for Jack without you is nothing compared to what lies ahead. Don't say that. They're saying Jack's chances are really good. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, Connor. I shouldn't have... - No, it's OK. It's OK. I should get going. Marissa... remember this... we met only on water. Now you're back ashore. Hi. I'd like to leave this for Jack Hagen. You can give it to him yourself. Jack, there's a delivery for you. Oh, and your mum called. She's going to be about half an hour. Imagine your incredible comet zapper blasting those nasty white blood cells. I'm zapping you dumb aliens to make room for red cells! Ready at last, Jack. Sorry about the wait, Mrs. Hagen. No, my mum's Mrs. Hagen. Gosh, Jack, I've got to fly. Here. You hold onto that, darling. And just remember... those nasty white blood cells don't have a chance. But I won't be zapping only for me. I think my dad's gonna move in with this lady that's not my mum, and if I die, my mum won't have anyone to help with the shopping or stuff like that. Bye, Jack. You OK in there? No. Why don't you come out and have some water? I've got a paper cup. What's wrong? Is it your child? It's hopeless. I know exactly how you feel. When I first heard about my Jack, it just... Look, I'll leave your water here on the sink. I'm available to have a chat. I'm up in Haematology, Room 4. Marissa Hagen. I nearly missed that one. An apple? - Ready? - Yep. - Actually, no. - Settle down. Hey! Settle down, you two! Listen, circus starts at 6:00. Your dad should easily be here by then. I'll be close by if you need anything. - OK. Yep. - Love you. Watch out. Coming through. - Have fun, kids. See you later. - Bye. - OK. You ready? - Yeah, I'll wait outside. I wish I was going to the circus! Still want to go? Yeah. Do you want me to come with you? I want to go with Jack and his dad. OK. Will do. - I'll be here to tuck you in. - OK. You know, I went to see Bernadette Saxon today. Oh, another diary entry? She and I used to work together and then she had David design their renovation. Anyway, she pretends not to recognise me. Hello? Bernadette. Marissa. - Oh! I'm sorry. - No, it's OK. It's been a while. It's been a long time, yeah. So I said, "Bernadette, any chance those kids of yours are David's?" Could be. Well, it depends. Did he spend any time in Turkana? It's right up in the north of Kenya. Here they are. Say hello to Mrs. Hagen, guys. Hi. Oh, no way. Really? That is unbelievable. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Our kids will be alright, won't they? Oh, listen, they'll be fine for an hour or two without us. In fact, it's good for them. Yeah, it will. You've called Veronica Mendelsohn. I'm sorry I'm not here at present. O-3. You finally sunk my ship. - He's not coming. - Doesn't look like it. Hey, Finn. Want to do something really exciting? Something way better than some stupid circus. Like what? Quiet. Try here. Oh, we found it! Yes! Gotta love that. Taxi! Taxi! Here we go. Hello, hello, hello. Hello. Yes, speaking. No, I'm not far away. What's wrong? No, no, no. They're with my husband David. They went to the circus event. Are you sure? Well, where's David? Yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can. They're saying the boys are missing. They can't find them. David, where the hell are you? I hope you're with the boys. Call me. Alright, come on. Come on. Veronica, look, we can adopt the baby out, if that's what you want, OK? Please. If you love me, you'll do this. Please! Please, will you do this?! Will you do it? It's my boy's life! Will you just please do it? David, please, the entire building can hear you. - Is that what you're worried about? - Yes. At this moment it is. Look, will you just please be reasonable? You are so unfair. How dare you lay this on me? I don't want a baby! I never did. Finn? Why didn't you say something? - I'm so cold. - Finn, I have to call someone. I don't know how to make you feel better. No. Make a fire. That'll make me feel better. What happened? Where are they? They're OK. They were spotted at Luna Park at about 8:00. Luna Park? Apparently they're having a grand old time. Aye. Down by the bay. Of course. We've got a car there looking for them. OK. Well, I'll go. You stay here. It'll be fine. - OK, young fella. - Hi. Are you Jack Hagen? - Where's your friend? - In the boat shed. He's really cold. With his immunity this low, we can't take any risks. - Temp's tipping 40. - He's had Panadol. - He's febrile. - Yeah. We're doing a septic work-up now. We'll get some IV into him, see how it goes. It'll make him comfortable. Hopefully bring the temperature down. It'll be alright. He's going to be fine, sweetheart. He's going to be fine, OK? - How could you forget? - I crashed the car. Can you see heaven with a telescope? Heaven? With a really powerful telescope, you can see horizons that people on earth can't even imagine. And kids who were friends, when they die, are they still friends in heaven? Nobody is sure about that, darling, but yeah, I think so. Professor. - Ah, David. - You wanted to see me? Yeah. Veronica Mendelsohn came to see me. Did she? More than that. She wanted prenatal diagnosis to test her baby for matching for Jack. Really? We've got a pretty simple procedure now. Right. So you can do it? We've done it. She wanted me to tell you that unfortunately it's not a match. She's got a pretty strong set of antigens there. - Blew yours right out of the water. - Right. - So the search continues. - Yeah. Gotta go. It's showtime, you lucky boy. I'll be back after I've had my coffee. Come on. Who's the PlayStation for? The child in bed 4. When he wakes up, it's going to be a big surprise, Jack. Hi. Kerry! Kerry. Kerry. Where's the bloody plug to the bath? - Who's she? - Hi. Hi. Sorry. Marissa Hagen. If you're selling something, forget it. If you're flogging some religion, I suggest you go next door. They need guidance. Is your name Janice Cromby? I knew it. You've got a summons. Janice Cromby doesn't live here. - Hasn't for years. - Hey, Janice! Have you got those curtains ready for my mum? Great timing, Bill. Piss off! Oh, Mum. He's the nicest boyfriend you've ever had. Don't treat him like a piece of shit. She shouldn't, should she? Do you remember David Hagen? You met him about 16 years ago. You were a model doing a shoot for Myer's at the Collins Street Uniting Church. He was in charge of the restoration. Apparently you and he had a fling. What is this? 20 questions? Look, he fathered my child, who now has leukaemia. I'm just looking for other kids he may have fathered. Cool! Like they all might have the same leukaemia? Doesn't quite work that way. - We're not complete morons, you know. - The jury's still out on that. Go find that bloody plug. Now! Jeez! Keep your shirt on. Look, is there any chance she could be David's child? That's all I want to know. If I'd thought there was any chance he was the father, I'd have hit him so hard for child support he'd have been crippled. OK. So I'll be coming off the drip, then? Yes, Finn, you will. Hi, love of my life. Here you go. We can go back to the boat and I'll wait. I don't know if I can live on the boat, son. The boat shed is very close. But we lived on the boat before, Dad. Why can't we now? He just needs a nurse that can row. Or... or sailing. We could go sailing. Do you want to go sailing, Jack? Can I, Mum? Please? Yeah. Don't see why not. You're coming home for the weekend anyway. Yes! Back on Monday, 9:00 am. Yeah, we can get a lot of telescope built in two whole days. You know how they say you can learn a language in your sleep? Well, I often go to sleep listening to your tapes. You must wake up quite the authority on rising damp. Yeah! Welcome back, Jack. Hi, everyone. Aw. What a nice surprise. - Thanks for coming out, everyone. - Nice hat. Thanks. This is for you, Jack. How sweet! What did you get? Take off your beanie, Jack. How'd you go this week, huh? Did you win? - Yeah. - Great! Now all will know you're aboard. Crew in place. We'll sit here at anchor until the storm blows through. At least I won't get seasick. No, you won't. Get ready to fall back. Here we go, Jack. Go across now. Pull the jib sheet in. Watch the boom. This is so cool. Remember to duck. - This is awesome! - I know. Point her a little to windward. Dad, I know what to do. Right. - Go faster? - Yeah. Pull on the main sheet. It came with 50 games. Which one do you want to play? Which game's the longest? Alrighty. Last lucky last. Last yucky last. Good job, honey. Are we still building the platform tomorrow, Dad? The weekend's all yours. Goodnight, my boy. Oh, it's so good to see him back in his own bed again. Yeah, it really is. OK, I'm gonna hit the road. I'll be back in the morning. Finn made some headway with that telescope today. Why don't you stay? Really? Yeah. Are you OK? It was for Jack. You trying to get pregnant? You know there's only a one-in-three chance of a match with siblings. It's better than the billion-to-one we have right now. - Mummy! - Sweetie! I'm coming, I'm coming. Mummy! It's leukaemia! I can smell it! No, it's OK. Hey, hey. - Why won't it stop? - Shh, just give me a look. - It's alright, it's alright. - Hey, listen. Look at me, darling. - It's just a nosebleed. - Take your hand... - Here, buster. Here you go. - That's it - pressure. - Just put pressure on it. - I'll call the hospital. OK, breathe through your mouth slowly. ♪ If you've got a tad too much blood ♪ And your name is nothing like Kevin Rudd ♪ Then you'd better squirt some of it out ♪ Whoo! On the sheets, on the road ♪ Out the front door till your neighbours are covered in red ♪ What you say? ♪ Till your neighbours are covered in red. ♪ Oh, that's great. Thanks, gentlemen. Thanks. Nasty shock, that one, eh? Look, it was a reaction to the cyclophosphamide. Rarely happens. But mind you, a slight change in air pressure can bring on these bleeds. You right, champ? Good boy. Stay tight. God. Your hands are so cold, son. Please don't take me back to the hospital. Please, Dad. Please. A hospital would make no difference. Really. It wouldn't. Now, who can I call? Can you build... another... Can you build... another castle... for tonight? So Mum... so Mum will know we’re home. Of course, son. Of course. What do you need? It's a south day. Jasmine will taste no good at all. I'm here for you. Mum. Mummy. Is that you? Darling, it's Marissa. He wouldn't take no for an answer. - We talked about this. I don't... - I want to be with Finn! I'll be in the car. Does... does it hurt? No. I just feel very sleepy. Listen. Jack... I want you to have my PlayStation. No, Finn. You keep it. You're going to get better. And... and I'll come over and play it with you. Whenever you want. Really. You can have it. But you've got to do something for me, though. But you have to promise. I promise. Look... look after my dad... for me. He's... He's gonna miss me, OK? You have to help him. OK? OK. OK. I want to stay awake until she comes. Imagine you're riding the waves with Fungie. Not now. It's almost... She's here. You'll be at home on those fairy islands. My boy. My boy. I shouldn't have taken him to Luna Park. You gave him his last big adventure. But maybe that was too much for him. No, no. Listen, mate. The doctors had already taken Finn off his medication. They knew he was dying. I miss him already. I know you do. I know you do. Finn must have been needed for something really special someplace else. Come on, sweet boy. Time for your bed. No! No! No! I just watched a little boy die. It doesn't have to be that way with Jack. We know what can save him. There's no-one on the register with an exact match. Goddamn elitist antigens. Look, a full match might surface, but it's more likely we'll find a partial. - Those are often successful, right? - Yeah, in 60% of cases. I'll tell you right now. If it was my child, I'd opt for a transplant with a partial match. Because this disease is progressing, and I mean progressing. - Hi. Are you Madeline Gardener? - No. That's Madeline Gardener over there. Hi, Madeline? I'm Marissa Hagen. Hi! You said your husband was in Johannesburg from March till October that same year. What does your husband look like? Oh, God. He's my height. He sort of has strong features, like your daughter. This is amazing. So, I mean... What are you saying? I might be right, then? Oh, no. I don't think so. See, Anton impregnated my sister so that we could have a child. I had a hysterectomy when I was, like, 16. It was in all the papers. - Hey, do you want something to eat? - No. I mean, this is fascinating. Claudia, hi. It's Marissa Hagen. Yeah, could be better, you know. Look, Claudia, I know this is a weird question... - Yes? - I'm not doing a survey. I'm not selling anything. I'm not a Jehovah's Witness. I'm just a mother and... ... I'd really like to ask you something, if that's OK. I really need to know what you want. My boy has leukaemia and I'm just looking for bone marrow donors. Are you going door to door? No. Not every door. Well, what brings you to my door? I believe you had an affair with my husband in 2000. Goodbye. Listen! Just, please, just give me a second! - Oh, I'm sorry! - I'm calling the police. - No, no, no! That was an accident! - Jessie, Nathan, get to your rooms. It was an accident! Hi, Jessie. Hi, Nathan. - Hey, Jessie, how old are you? - I'm nine. Jessie, get to your room now! Listen to me, OK? My boy is dying. Alright? Do you understand? If you slept with my husband, she could have matching bone marrow. It's a very simple procedure for her. She doesn't even eat meat! He was here for months renovating this house in 2000. Come on! We bought this house in 2002. - Aren't you Angela Lewis? - Angela Lewis? - Angela and Grant Lewis! I mean... - Grant Lewis? We bought this house from him. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry, kids. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. When will you be back? When Ireland's had enough of me. Fair Midhir. Always the bridesmaid. Don't despair. Your time will come. I was wondering how you'd been. Not really very good, Marissa. Not good at all. And Jack? Struggling. We still can't find a bone marrow match, so... I hope you do. You look after yourself, OK? Thanks. Not flathead. Flat bread. - Hello. - Hi. She runs her 'B's into her 'R's like 'H's. The bakery's three aisles left. Thank you. I was gonna call you 'cause I wanted to thank you... for... taking the test. I'm sorry it didn't work out. My termination's on Saturday night. Saturday night? Wouldn't have thought they'd be open on... Yeah. It's a niche market for women who work. You'd be a great mum. - Would it help... - No. No? Do you want me to take you? It's not a date, David. OK. Are you Jack? That's what they call me. I'm Kerry. Hi. I'm your sister. I am not taking you to the movies! - Jeez. - Sister? I don't have a sister. Well, you do now. How could you be my sister? You serious? Well... your dad bonked my mum, I guess. Look, I may be able to help you. ♪ I wish I was in Carrickfergus ♪ Only for nights in Ballygrand ♪ I would swim over the deepest ocean... ♪ - Come on, boys. - ♪ The deepest ocean... ♪ Cheers.

Thanks for coming in. Yeah, look, I've just got to say that I'm still not happy about this. Mum, put a sock in it. - I'm going to see Jack. - OK. He's with his dad. Dad, how are you going to live by yourself? - You can't cook or anything. - What do you mean, I can't cook? I can cook. You've had my paella many times. Twice. And the second time, I got the trots. Hey. Can I come in? - Hey. Sure. - Hi, Kerry. Hi, Dad. Mum wants to see you. Listen, Kerry, I'd really rather you didn't... Call you 'Dad'? Yeah. What about 'Pops' or 'Dadda'? Oh, 'David' is probably fine. OK, Pops. How are you feeling? Shithouse. But everyone gets really worried if I'm not OK. You know, they tested my marshmallow. Marshmallow? Bone marrow, marshmallow. I don't think she should do this. The risks are really minimal, Janice. Oh, thanks for your concern, David. I understand you've got reservations and this is a big thing for an adult to do, let alone a child. Yeah, but look, the procedure, it's very straightforward. It's like giving blood. They harvest the bone marrow and they return the blood. I know what the procedure is. How are we all? Good, thanks. - Ready to do this? - Yeah. You'll be right, mate. I guess kids, they're just so resilient. So, folks, young Kerry here's undergone the tests... to determine if she's a match for Jack. And they have HLA compatibility of 6/6 markers, which is pretty much as close as you can get. So we have a match. Congratulations. Come see me when you're ready. Kerry's a match, honey. Cool. That's very cool. - Very cool. - Are you sure you want to do this? Mum. You're 15, Kez. You need my consent. And his, apparently. - Oh, I don't think... - Of course you don't. You never did. Please, Janice. He's a really sick boy. I need you to... Please, I can see. I've always wanted a brother. - First I've heard. - Mum, Jesus, stop it. Will you just... will you just nod your head? Like this. Mum, I really, really want to do this. Please. OK. OK. Where do I sign? I guess with the professor. Thank you, Janice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're going to be OK. That's it! That's it! Come on! Come on, come on, come on, come on! He's going to... Yeah! Yes! Connor? When did you get back? A couple of days ago. I went down to your shop. Yeah, I haven't been in. But you're OK? I wanted to call. I just... I didn't know where. It's fine. And Jack? He's fine. - He just came first in a race. - What? You didn't see him. I was screaming. He wanted a boat. Well, I should go and see him, you know. - Yeah. Yeah, no, he'd love that. - Help him de-rig. Have you eaten? Eaten? It's 5 o'clock. Yes, but it's Saturday. You... It's good to see you. It's good to see you too. Ready, and... it'll come. Let it down. All the way. That's it. Good. Here it comes. - Here it comes. Perfect! - Whoo! Great. And the jib. Lift that. - Ready? - Yep.
