[Prayer] Hey, didn’t we discuss that we wouldn’t harm any living thing? Drive carefully! Yes sir... everything looks clear on the left side There are two guards. Yes sir. Hey, why did you stop? Take the bags soon.. We are running out of time. A small change in the plan. Search on the other side. - Okay sir. Hello, did you find the black van? - No sir. Couldn't catch him the guy drove too fast and he ecaped. Inform the control room immediately and alert every check post. What do you want? - Ma'am, there is a letter for you. Hello, Govt. Ladies Hostel. No way.. Not possible. Ma'am. Ma'am. There is a letter for you. Thank you. My hands are dirty... can you read it for me? Congrats Varalakshmi Madam In the yearly lucky draw held by Prestige Company you have won a prize. Please collect your gift from our Miyapur Office tommorrow morning at 11:00 a.m. I have freshly prepared Tamarind rice, would you like to have some? Yes please. - Come in. This Tamarind rice is delicious madam! My Son also loves this a lot. Anyways, you have booked such a big truck. What’s the cargo? It could be either a Fridge or a washing machine or even a cupboard. She said it's a huge company but this place doesn't look like it. Anyway, it's better I discuss my fare before-hand. Madam, even if you get small kitchen items as gifts, You would still have to pay me my auto fare. Shut up, jinx of a fellow! Jinx of a fellow...? Stay there. Okay. Just a minute... Just a minute... Just a minute... Sorry. 7th floor 7th floor A Kid! I got scared, I didn't notice her. 7th floor for you too? Come in... I've been waiting for you. Please come in. Did you send these letters? I only sent it... please come in. We'll talk about it. Thought it was a gift from a huge company. So, there is only one gift for all of us? I brought a huge truck thinking otherwise Looking at this... it doesn't seem like. - That's what I am not able to understand. I am Saraswati. My grandson Jagan. His first year death anniversary took place recently. Last year, he was one among the five to be killed in the Panjagutta bank robbery. Varalakshmi, your son Rajaram also got killed on the same day. Priya... Your fiance Avinash also got killed on the same day. Swathi's elder Brother, Karthik... this little girl's father, Brahmam. All of them got killed on the same day We are the only ones alive related to these five men Just like me, all of you are also Orphans now. The 6th person ruthlessly shot and killed our five men. All of you know, right Wait... wait.. Wait... That means, aren't you the one who has been calling me repeatedly about this case from the last one year? Not only you... I've been calling all of you. No one cared about it, that's why I had to gather us like this I suffered for a year... I completed his death rituals. I've decided to not put up with this anymore. I will take my revenge now. Revenge..? Yes, all of you have to join me. Let's kill him together What is this...? Have you gone crazy? How old are you..? May be 80 years. Forget about you and me... we finished more than half of our lives This little baby... This young girl can study and has a bright future... This one can get married and look forward to a happy life... do you want to sacrifice everyone for your revenge? Yes... even I am suffering my son's death I am also angry on the murderer I pray everyday that murderer suffers... what else can I do? Why are you smiling? What is the matter? Looks like the gifts are heavy, do you want me to help you? My foot! You successfully jinxed my lucky draw. I'll break your legs if I see you again. Madam, my fare? - Go away. You Idiot. Granny, we are common women. We won't be able to do it. Just because of we are women... should we let go off the revenge and sit helplessly? We are women. We can give life to a person... taking it away shouldn't be that tough. If that murderer killed us instead of our men... wouldn't they get back to kill him? Don't you understand? Irrespective of you four joining me, I am going to kill him. All of you can leave now. Oh, my baby... This little girl can't talk... she lost her mom at a very young age... she is living in an orphanage because of that guy. Granny, I'll also come with you. We shouldn't leave him. Let's kill him. Definitely. But how...? Where do we start? Killing five people... If he is roaming free for more than a year after robbing 300 crores... how smart would that guy be..? To catch hold off someone like him we need someone who is way smarter than him. Look at this. Pencil Parthasarathy! Famous author who writes only revenge novels. He has written 28 novels untill now. I read each of them about ten times. Every novel has a crime, a murderer... and to get hold off him there is a hero who catches him with his wits. Do you know how well he has written them? If he has written 28 such novels, Imagine how revengeful he would be? Every story has its own way of revenge. We need this kind of a guy for our revenge. Is there any address mentioned inside? Madam! That is not the house you should be looking at... this is the one. How is such a big author living in this garbage? His situation seems to be worse than ours. Everyone has their own sentimental reasons. Maybe he found success here. It’s not our concern. Let’s go inside. Come. Come. (“Jayamu nishchayambura” song from ‘Shabash Ramudu’ playing) He has left the door open. Mr. Pencil? Is anyone here? Oh Goodness! Wow! Thousands of books. If he has read all these books, He must definitely be a highly intellectual person. He must also be an old man! Anyway, where is he? He must be inside. Good. What’s your name? Catherine. She is my daughter. (Watching TV) I said I want the truth. She is my sister. She is my daughter. My sister.... my daughter. I said I want the truth! She is my sister and my daughter! This... This is what writing means! This is what climax looks like! This is what a twist in tale means! This is how i need to write. No... I must write this story itself. I found these in your backyard in the pond I found these in your backyard in the pond. I said I want the truth I said I want the truth Oh yes, probably Oh yes, probably I said I want the truth He is alone... Look at how focused he is on his work. He must be a really good author. He is not a good author, He is a copycat. He is translating the exact dialogues into Telugu from English. Did you notice all the movie DVD's around him? Show me the books which you got. Here... 'Raseedu ni champu ('"Kill Bill.") This is a very good book. A girl in this book takes revenge against the villain exactly like us. She is a pro with fist fights and swords... She does it all. I read this but I didn’t understand who this 'Raseedu' is. Granny, 'Raseedu' is Bill. It’s a movie... Kill Bill! Oh Goodness! 'No country for Old men.' - Oh no! That’s... No country for Old men. Oh... Is that so? 'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang!' This is really good. I read it. Granny, people are copying novels and making movies. But he is copying movies and writing novels. He is a very big fraud! You only put him on a pedestal. Chinnu! He might have copied 28 novels... But he probably read all these books here, He must have an iota of .... Oh no....! Hey... look at this... Look Grandma, look! Look at the thousands of books he read. This is all thermocol! He is a fraud! Fraud for sure! Oh Goodness! We need to leave from here immediately. Yes. We must. Let’s go. Full stop... Full stop... Full stop.... They put four full stops. The... End. I finished my 29th novel. I am going to look at just one novel... just one. Look... look... let’s take a look at this. Please come Granny... he will see us... please let's go. Come Granny... put it back... put it back. Oh My Goodness! Come Granny... Hello... who is there? ('Nee Toli Choopulone' Song from 'Justice Chowdary' Movie) Who are you all? Pencil? Yes... Yes... I am the pencil. The famous revenge writer... Pencil Parthasarathy. Come ... Come... Welcome... My house. She is wearing a ring, looks like she is married. Mr. Pencil... Pencil, sir... Sorry... This is how a writer’s world is, usually filled with books. All the authors who wrote these Revenge books aren't writers, they are my relatives... are my gods. They are my mentors... It's them who shaped me into a world-famous Revenge writer. Uh... we are... - My fans! My fans Am I Right? Tell me... do you want a selfie or an autograph? Why would we take a photo with you? So why did you come? A year ago, wasn’t there a robbery in the Bank at Punjagutta? Yes. I remember. One of the robbers brutally murdered the remaining five... Not brutally granny, he killed easily... If only he had killed the remaining five by torturing them repeatedly, That would have been an interesting material. Why is she so excited? This woman is the mother of one of those five men. I am the grandmother to one of those men. She is the sister of one. Oh god! That little girl is the daughter... Oh no. And this one was to be married to one of them. That means... Engaged... Not yet married? No problem.. I meant... it’s a problem.. How sad! The sixth person ran away with Rs. 300 crores. Lucky fellow. What...?! Loafer fellow! He committed a gruesome mistake! That is the reason why we have gotten together. We wanted to catch him... What after that...? Are planning to kill him. You wanted to kill him? Wonderful idea! 'Everyone should be happy.' All the very best. Kill him. We need your help for our revenge. May I know why you guys chose me for such a prestigious project? I read all of your 28 novels. All of them were about revenge. They are very well-written. That is why with your advice and direction, We wanted to catch that murderer. We want you to join us Pencil. Work with us, please. Work...? Work means money. One lakh per person... There are five people, so five lakhs... But regarding the payment, it wouldn’t be less than 5 lakhs. 5 lakhs? We can’t afford any cash. It's okay... then pay through cheque. We are very poor. We don’t have any money. That is why we need your help. Help? Social service? Help... Pure help. Mr Pencil. Get up! Get up! Get the hell up! Free help, is it? Why are you sitting here? Did you not wonder who would take a photo with me? Get up! Don’t push me! - Push you? I should kick you. And you little thing? Leave that doll alone. Leave that doll alone. Look at this arrogant kid. What...? All of you have become a gang? Get out everybody! Get the hell out! Ok, we will go. Give me your phone number. Should I give my phone number. Who asked for yours, old lady? Didn't you mention you have to kill that 6th guy...? Go and kill him. Get out and kill random people... Move. Get out. Wait.. Wait.. Wait... Hey Girl come... come... You come. Get out! What’s with that look? You have come to waste my time this morning! I just finished my 29th novel and my best friend is waiting to publish it... This nonsense! What a waste of time! Sir, money Sir. Oh..! I forgot it. Hey, MANIKYAM! MANIKYAM! Sir...? What’s wrong, Sir? Hey... he is on his way here. - Who are you talking about? That... P... P...P... Pencil ... pencil fellow is coming here. Give me my pressure ball. Take this, sir. If that guy comes up, I am going to make you read all his books ten times. No, sir. Please don’t do that to me... I had accidentally read one page of his book... And ... I suffered with cold shivers and fever for an entire week Keep squeezing this hard, I'll manage him. Go. Sir... Sir.... Sir... - Tell me, Manikyam. Sir is not in the office. But his car is here. He parked his car here and went on a world tour. Caribbean to Kazakhstan via Pakistan. Pakistan? Yes, Sir.. What am I to do with it? I finished my 29th novel today. I am dying to narrate it to someone or the other. You seem pretty unoccupied, Why don’t you come with me? No, sir. I have a lot of work, sir. Come... come... It will only take 5 hours. 5 hours? Can I not avoid it? - No. You can’t. Leave my hand, sir Please... Sir is upstairs. He is waiting for you. Go. You told me he was in Pakistan. - No, Sir.. I'll go to Pakistan Hey... Ramakrishna... MANIKYAM! Ramakrishna... Ramakrishna... Sit down. All the other stories are pale in comparison. This is a league apart. This one has a brilliant climax... and very exciting scenes... Sound effects, horror effects... In fact, I was scared while writing it. Then, why? Why do you write it if you are scared? Why should I publish it with fear? Is this struggle really necessary? Why don’t you stop? You are asking a world-famous creative writer to stop? That’s not possible. Oh my Gosh! I don’t have any money on me, buddy You don’t have any money? What about all the profits that you made with my 28 best selling novels? Profits, eh? Who bought all those good-for-nothing novels of yours? You have a copy and I have a copy And some half-wit... And some half-wit who doesn’t have even an iota of movie knowledge bought it! Listen to me, buddy I don’t have any money... I can't be publishing this... Leave me alone, please Is that so? Hey, Buddy... I am an orphan. I am an orphan. I am an orphan. Please give me a kiss. I am an orphan. Give him that kiss. 'China Bazar' [This book is dedicated to Sravani] I have been helping you right from childhood... and yet you dedicate every single book to Shravani? You can say anything about me but not a word against her. She left me but I am confident that she would realise it was a mistake and come back to me. Like hell she would! Hey, Earlier in the morning today, five women visited me. They spouted nonsense about revenge... But there was one girl amidst them... Hot, I tell you... Hot! I was enamoured. And so, I listened to all the nonsense that they spouted. Looking at them, I saw a complete life cycle... right from birth to death. Why did they come? Do you remember that Punjagutta bank robbery? They are apparently the families of the people who died in that mishap. And that sixth one... Killer. Apparently, they want to catch the killer and kill him. And they wanted my help! As If I am ready to help them! Why do they want your help? The half-wit who bought that other copy Is not a guy... she is an old lady. My fan. Revenge... And a famous writer helping them. Finally you accepted me as a 'famous writer'. You... So that writer is going to use his creative skill and nab the murderer... And how he is going to be of help to the ladies who seek revenge... That is the story. That old lady is quite enthusiastic. She looked like she would shoot that murderer on sight.. Super, buddy! Hey Buddy... I saw your eyes burn with passion when you were a child. I believed that you would turn into a great writer one day. And that is the reason why I gave you all those CDs Not to copy... but to be inspired. Is it? Yes. Help those five women and try to nab the criminal. Jot down everything that happens everyday as your novel. Those five are going to be your characters. Their journey is your story. For the first time in your life, You have an original story. You are my brother-from-another-mother! I will bear all the cost I will even sell my assets and Produce this project. What do you say? What do you say? Hey, old lady... Just like a dry leave hanging to a tree.. How long do you think you have? Everyone in your family passed away. Aren't you disgusted to be the only one left? You can also die, right? What if I broke in to your house and killed you... the police would confirm that you have died of heart-attack. No one cares about a stray dog's death That's why write this house on my name. You can rest at the oldage home which you visit regularly, Listen to me... sign on these documents Please... Granny... Granny... You came and asked for help but didn't give the address. Had to go through a lot to find you. Why are you using the stairs? Isn't the lift working? Who are you? I am this building's... Watchman? Being the watchman shouldn't you be helping this old lady who is trying to climb the stairs I am the owner... owner, sir. Owner? - Yes. If you are the owner, what are you doing when the lift is not working? Check it! Granny... Pencil. Come, I'll take you up. Come Granny... What floor do you have to go to? - 7th floor. 7th floor is it? Couldn't you find a house on the first floor? As a writer you should have physical fitness also not only mental fitness. Why did you come? You asked for help, right? You sent me away, didn't you? I'll tell you the truth, Granny. I couldn't sleep in the night. I thought it was the mosquitoes but later I understood that it was you. Regret, Granny... I Regret sending all of you away. I've written multiple revenge stories. How can I not help for a real one? I'll do it, Granny. Please... accept it. Shouldn't rest of the woman be on board too? I'll take care of the rest.. You accept it first. You say okay. Okay? Put them on. Why do we need this? Revenge needs a signature style, slowmotion, background score, there are plenty like these... You put them on. ♫ Come now, Let’s win over the world. ♫ ♫Come on, let’s rewrite the history. ♫ ♫ Come on, let’s challenge the future and march against it at all odds. ♫ ♫ Come on now, let’s put in the effort ♫ ♫ Come now, let’s harden our hearts ♫ ♫ Come on now, let’s destroy the evil ♫ ♫ With a secret strategy. ♫ ♫ Cross the rooms, hours, thresholds ♫ ♫ Cross the seas, obstacles and others ♫ ♫ Fly, Fly, Fly away♫ ♫ Fly away, Fly away Fly away ♫ ♫ And spread to the ten corners of the world. ♫ ♫ Cross those temptations; those cries and cages ♫ ♫ Cross others; the mountains and those streams ♫ ♫ Fly, Fly, Fly away♫ ♫ Fly away, Fly away Fly away ♫ ♫ And see the flash of final victory. ♫ ♫ We bring the game here ♫ ♫ We come here to stay ♫ ♫ Ah, we come here to play ♫ ♫ Repeat ♫ ♫ Sing with me ♫ ♫ We bring the game here ♫ ♫ We come here to stay ♫ ♫ Ah, we come here to play ♫ ♫ Come now, Let’s win over the world. ♫ ♫Come on, let’s rewrite the history. ♫ ♫ Come on, let’s challenge the future and march against it at all odds. ♫ ♫ Come on now, let’s put in the effort ♫ ♫ Come now, let’s harden our hearts ♫ ♫ Come on now, let’s destroy the evil ♫ ♫ With a secret strategy. ♫ What is all this Pencil? RTI... I got this from the 'Right to Information act'. All the details regarding the police investigation are in this. The details regarding the private investigation done by senior journalist Satyanarayana Murthy, sir, are in here. This has all the details regarding your five families. Would you really need a file to know about us? And what’s this board about? All the protagonists in my books had such big boards... and the details relating to the case such as Evidence, photographs, maps, paper cuttings and such details are on this. One needs to spend only two minutes on this, you are bound to find a clue. I have been thinking for two days... I don’t have a clue but I have a head ache! I am unable to understand a thing. What happened? Where is my pen? I've got a clue Between what you told me and what the police investigation revealed, There is one thing... Your family members were all ordinary people. There isn’t a single criminal background on any of them So, the police concluded that these five would have hired a professional robber... And so, they investigated people with robbery related criminal records. But it was useless. Another thing is, the escape vehicle is black colour van. A black colour van means a mortuary van. So, the police investigated these kinds of vans in the entire state. But it turned out to be useless. And so, this case hit a dead end. We already knew this... but tell us what is the clue that you found. Look at the photo. Watches? Even the police found them to be watches But the eyes of 'Pencil' found the stopwatches in them. Oh yes, stop watches. Why? For perfection. To finish the job before the police arrives on the crime scene. Practice makes a man perfect. For an ordinary person, to do an extrordinary work he needs practice. According to the records... the police arrived within 18 minutes of alarm activation. To get 300 crores from 14th floor in 18 minutes how much practice would they need? So, I am sure they must have practiced at an under construction abandoned building for a while. And that building would have been a minimum of 14 floors. So, we need to figure out where these buildings are how many of them are they? And all such details need to be procured. Where would we get them from? GHMC Get Varalakhmi dressed up as an ACB officer... and meanwhile I'll finish one Important task. What is that? Do you need any help? Please. Oh! We have enterd into the bathroom while talking to him and following him. Let's move... Officer... Move. Hey! Move... Move... What’s happening here? What are you guys doing here? Have you been giving out permissions for bribe? Yesterday in Dilsukhnagar a building of 14 floors crashed! You know how many people passed away in that accident? You are all done. How many buildings have you authorised construction on illegally? And how many other buildings with 14 floors exist in and around the city? In five seconds, I want the entire list... the entire list! I meant in front of Madam. Where is your officer? Call your officer. Where is the Officer? Hello, excuse me... Who are you people? We are from Anti-Corruption Bureau, ACB Senior officer and her subordinate. She has a sore throat, so I am shouting instead of her That's what I am talking about. We want the entire list of building with 14 floors. Immediately! Right now! First show me your ID card. ID card, eh? You said ACB, right? Show me the ID card. ID card. ID card. Damn ID card! Take it. Aadhar card, eh? Make do with that. We want the list. The list of all the buildings with 14 floors. Raju... - Sir. Close all the doors. - Ok Sir. Call the police. Would you call the cops on us? Would you call the cops on us? Would you call the cops on us? Hey... Why are they talking about police? It’s ok, officer. I will deal with it... Officer my foot! Officer.... I am in no way related to this man. I kept telling him.. But he dressed me up and got me here. Hand him over to the police. Him and his useless ideas. - Varalakshmi! This is not working... So, when we go to GHMC office we must carry a valid ID. Since I am writing the book I must be prepeared for all situations before hand. Nonetheless, writing a book by copying is a cakewalk But using creativity is something else altogether. Pencil, ACB officer, Ready. - Is that so? Tell her to come on in. Careful. Do one thing, Get two AK 47s as well. Alright. Hello, where are you going? You asked me to get you something. So, you don’t even know what those are right? Leave it. What’s with that dressing? It's for a building list not to wage war. I am sorry... Go on and change and remove that make-up Its unbearable. What about this? Go burn it... I don’t want to see it again. Anyways, I changed the plan. Changed the plan? How can you do that this easily? She is not the one who is going to come with me, it's you. Me? What’s the plan, anyways? First, we have to prepare an Anti-Corruption Bureau department fake ID. Fake ID? No.. We shall prepare for civils, get the job and then we will use the Original IDs Ok. Please don't open your mouth over there. I will take care of it... Excuse me, sir. Can we come off in? Who are you? We from Anti-Corruption Bureau. No..no.. You please Sit down Officer. Please come... sit. Tell me, Sir. You don’t have to worry. A few days ago, a 14 storey building crashed to the ground at Dilshukhnagar. You must have thoroughly checked them before you gave them the necessary permits. But that builder has escaped by submitting duplicate papers. If you could provide me the details of 14 storeyed buildings... We will go to each building and cross check the list. One minute. My ID card. ID card is not necessary, Sir. You asked me in a very cool and decent manner. I like it. I meant... just as a formality if you could check. There is no need for this formality. It’s not an Aadhar card. Its an original ID card. No need. Just take a look at it once, sir. The poor thing was awake the whole night and worked hard on it. I meant... Not only one night, officer. How many nights... I worked hard.... Those sleepless nights, without food... In a small room... I studied hard and got through the exam I finally achieved it. Great sir, Really great, sir Hey, Raju! - Sir Raju! Get the 14 floors and above floors Buildings list. - Ok Sir. Files. From tomorrow onwards, we should start filtering these buildings. We are looking at abandoned buildings primarily. This is mainly because they wouldn't have rehearsed at a crowded place. Okay. I have also created ‘Whatsapp’ group for all of us. Name is 'Revengers' I will post all the updates over there and if you have any doubts, ask me about it. But do not post any good mornings, good nights, stupid jokes, tiktok videos or dub smash videos or god’s photos... And don’t post chain messages that have a clause to be forwarded. If you do so... i'll get irritated. Our focus should entirely be on Revenge. Not on rings. Ok. My dear revengers. Wish each other ‘All the Best’ ‘All the Best’ ‘All the Best’ Thanks.

Why are you this slow? There are a lot more buildings left. Slow? What? You better lift her. She is gaining weight because of your Tamarind rice. What Granny... are you tired? Yeah, I have climbed so many steps You are not Granny... you are a Godzilla. I can't lift you from the next building onwards. You spread across and search all the corners... if you find any clue let me know. Then Sherlock holmes will enter. You go that side. You take that one. Pulihora madam.... Hey Chinnu don't go towards the edge, we are on the 14th floor After you are all done looking, come and wait at this spot. Okay? Pencil. My brother was here. How do you know that? Look at this. He loves solving these puzzles. This is his handwriting. Hey... Pencil. This is my son’s. I bought it for him. The food outside made him sick So, I packed his lunch for him every day. Your dad? That means this building... Seeing an empty wall an inner painter emerges in people and they start to feel like 'The Great Painter Jakkanna' Hey Grandma, Didn’t you find anything? Search ...Your grandson must have left something behind. He has left Revenge for me to take. Oh! Revenge. What is this? Dummy cash and other things used while practising. They must have definitely practiced here in this building. Did you see how Pencil figured it all out with his wit? So, one thing is done. We found the building we were searching for. Mr. Pencil... What we want isn’t a building! We are looking for a murderer. Let’s take this one step at a time. We just found the building... Let’s not get ahead to murderer, revenge, murder... Pencil... Pencil... Where are you going? The bank robbery happened on 7th of August 2018. So, footage from the ATM cctv that is dated 6 months before the incident could give us a clue into this robbery. There will be an admin that collects all the footage from this bank’s ATM cctvs'. We must get our hands on it. So, go and get it. It’s not that easy. They are going to make us run around in circles for a year or so by asking us to get Police Complaint letters, Permissions, etc. By then, Granny might have kicked the bucket. What does kicking the bucket mean? It means you might get fragile. You are right... So, what should we do now? He will not give if we will ask. And in the same way, The most powerful weapon in the world which can trap even the most formidable men... A woman! I will go... I will. Granny... A woman.... I don’t think you understood the concept. He needs to be seduced, sweet talked to and charmed. To extract the footage I can't do it. Now tell me who is going to volunteer? Absurd! It’s unethical to put girl who is on the threshold to be married, into this kind of situation Let’s go through the normal channels through complaints But do not put Priya into such situations. Fine, alright! It’s your revenge. The choice is yours. What is in it for me. Grandma, its best you be prepared to kick the bucket. Come on. Let’s go. I will go. What? I will go. Alright, Good luck. All the best. It’s the room on the right hand corner. - It's Ok. Dear, be careful. Miss. Priya... unbutton your top. It’s an absolute necessity, Granny. Honey trapping is not a joke. Excuse me Sir.

If there is a birthmark... then I'll manage. Birthmark? Fix it carefully... Wait sir.. Let me do it. Fix it slowly... He hid the bulbs here. So, he is into men.

There is no way we can identify the people this way. We can see that there are five people But it’s difficult to say if they are your family members. But according to the body language... That’s Avinash That’s my son. Is he your Dad? That’s my brother. The last one? Your grandson? Everyone is carrying a single bag... but my son was carrying 3 bags. Does any of your family members here have the habit of writing with the left hand? This is the 6th person that we have been looking for. They changed the colour of the Ambulance and let the police astray The name of the hospital that starts with an ‘S’ It looks familiar. - Swasth care. Swasth care... right. Swasth care hospitals... Afterall I am an ambulance driver, why are you interviewing me? That is our topic, sir. About 'Ambulence drivers and their life' How much is the salary for someone who drives an ambulance? I have been working hard for the past 10 years... I make around 15,000 Rs/month. How much money are your making? Since I am a senior reporter, I earn 3 lakhs per month. 3 lakhs? If I made 3 lakhs per month I would have my sister would have married royally. My sister's wedding is in next month. All my relatives are morons. They come to the wedding for the food but don't lend any helping hand. Let’s talk about the Interview. - Sorry sir, I am getting emotional. Isn’t there any inspiring story with regards to any ambulance drivers? Inspiring? I mean... someone who recently earned alot of money. May be bought a car or purchased a house recently? Oh yes. For sure! One of us. Who? Switch on mobiles for recording? Look behind... Behind, Sir! Behind you, sir! Dev... A year ago, he worked as a driver here. Now, he is a millionaire. While driving an Ambulance, He has a track record of 100 % success ratio. Not a single patient has lost life in his ambulance. All those blessings are making it count for him. Sir, do not write about me.. Write about him instead. This man is the number one racer in India. Fantastic... it's awesome. So, let’s welcome the sportsman of the year 2018, Mr. Dev. Welcome... Mr. Dev. Please have a seat. Not just your driving skills There is a magical speed in your career as well. A year ago, you were an ordinary ambulance driver. And now, you are India’s N0.1 racer. Youth icon and what not. You have seen the journey of being a common man to a celebrity. We have held our breath to hear your inspiring story. Please tell us. What’s there to say? It’s God’s blessing, The support of my parents And these fans support... Oh come on... But behind every success there is a lot of struggle. We are seeing your success Tell us about the struggles that you have been through How did you get interested in racing? Since when? Ever since I was born. When I was a child, my mom would always tell me You are always in a hurry That is why you were born in the seventh month. This speed did not come with practice or some rehearsal. I am born with speed. It’s there in my blood. Speed is in my blood. I am not done yet. I want more. It’s 10:20 p.m. now. In another 10 minutes, all the wine shops would be closed It takes half-an-hour to go there. What do we do? I will get it. Give me the car keys. It takes 5 minutes to get the car out of parking. How? He will get that. A bet of 1000 Rs. Tell me... Not a 1000. I will give you 2000 Rs. Just in 9 minutes? How? - Give me the money. Here... take it Deva, you are going to be a N0.1 racer. Sachin is the God of Cricket. And my man Deva... You know how much a race car costs? Rs.3 crores and how much for racing club? Rs.150 crores. What should I do to get that money? People like us shouldn't have such big desires. That's only for the rich. What ever you do you can't become a racer in this life time. Leave it. The only dream I have is to become a racer. Don't take that one thing away from me. It's not that... Everyones is doing so much for their sons. But you did nothing for me from the day I was born. I don't have a mom either. Who else do I have? Tell me... what should I do? I'll do anything for you. Please die. You lived for sixty years without any use for me... how many more do you need? You got Insurance done for one lakh rupees, right? Will get a new bike. Please die... please... Unfortunately, my father died of a heart attack. My father was everything to me. He raised me in a way that I never missed having a mother. My father sacrificed his life for me But he never got to see my success. It took me a lot of time to get over his death. Deva... Why did you spend the entire insurance money on this? You don’t have a job... what are you going to do now? Listen to me, take the post of an ambulance driver. I wanted to become a racer, not a driver. An ambulance driver is almost a racer Bro. No one can question you. To drive the vehicle fast is the only qualification required for an ambulance driver. The minute I got the patient into my vehicle, That is when my race would start. If I could successfully transport the patient alive to the hospital That would mean that I won the race If not.. I lost the race. Guess what? I never lost a race. I've won all my bloody races. Thanks for bringing my father here on time and saving him. My father would like to see you. Please come. Last night it took me 20 minutes to reach the bank from the police station... after the alarm gets activated we need 20 minutes until we load the money into the van.. Police will reach the spot by then... We need a person who can drive really fast to escape from the police. I have been observing this guy from a really long time. Amazing driver. He is the right person for our job. The money in the Bank always has an insurance. The account holders wouldn't be inconvenienced. Insurance money covers it all. If it’s ok with you, tell us. You get an equal share as well. What’s the total amount? - Probably 300 crores. I will drive. Dev... What an Inspiring story. Thank you so much for motivating all of us. Hey, wake up. One popcorn for me. Are we in a cinema hall? Pencil, listening to his story. What did you think? It looks like a story. He must be the one that we are searching for. He looks to be about the same height of the man in the footage. He also has similar body language. But still I am not completely sure. I am sure though. I'll prove it. Yeah, I am coming tomorrow You must be tired after telling them these stories. I meant you must be tired after telling them your life story. Autograph? I am a big fan of you. Sir. Nothing... a fan asked me for an autograph Thank you Sir. Everything will set right by tomorrow. He is the same man. For sure. The same man. Look at how he signed. The same man. Be ready for war. 'I'll blow the conch shell now.' Mr. Dev. India’s No. 1 racer. This is what the world knows about him. The man who murdered 5 people in a gruesome manner. We are the only ones who know this truth. He is not a driver, granny... he is a celebrity. It isn’t going to be easy killing him. And, he is not in the city. Currently he is in Europe for an Ad shoot. He wouldn’t be back until the next Wednesday. What are we going to do until then? The six of us.... By mistake... Sorry. The six of us... How is it that there's only five of us here? Where is Chinnu? Chinnu? Chinnu... Chinnu.. Chinnu.. Trying to get away from the revenge class.. What are you doing here? Are you crying? Did someone say something? Tell me? I will take care of it. Then what’s wrong?

Why would there be snoring? You irritating irresponsible revengers. Wake up... wake up... Granny... get up now! Why? What happened? You guys ate a lot and are when it's time for work you're sleeping.. Look at her. She is still sleeping. Varalakshmi madam... Varalakshmi madam... You guys want Tamarind rice.

I told you before... after he get's back to india we need to observe his activities 24x7 Bad guys roam only during the nights. Haven't I mentioned it clearly in my book? Pencil... - Yes. Look at there. Hey... why did he come to this building? Do you think we are caught? I am scared for some unfathomable reason. Please stay calm. Dear God! Dear God! Let nothing uncertain happen to us. Please God. He didn't go to the 14th floor, he went to 15th floor. It’s dark, right. He must be mistaken. We must be mistaken. Why would he be mistaken? I am sure he has come here many times. We stopped at the 14th floor... we should have check the remaining floors too. What are we going to do? We'll be waiting here until he leaves... Let’s go and surround him. Then...? I am going to dig a grave and bury him here. Oh no! Ganny. Where did you find this? - Where did you find this? This? I had it with me earlier. Oh! Is it...? It was this knife poking me since then. I will go ahead and kill him. I am going to fulfil my revenge. Granny! If we go on and kill him without a plan or preparation, we will all be in Jail. I will still look fine in a criminal outfit, But it might be difficult for you. You might look like a Zebra. Listen to me... stow it inside. No.. Not here. I will keep this with me. You let it be. We should wait here until he returns. Come on, hide. We are at 15th floor. Slowly... Slowly... Why do we need you here? You should have stayed in the car. Granny! What is it? All of you! Gather here! See... Dev's shoe marks. Come. He went that side, come. The shoe marks have stopped here. What could have he done, standing here? Cigarettes. He smoked like this... Dev is a left hander, right! Which means it's this way... There is nothing here. He must have smoked standing this way. This is not an original pillar. Go and get the rod. Hold this. Pencil, what is this? Oh my Goodness! My dear Revengers... Get ready. Game starts now. Dev, it’s 9:30 already. So what? So, the BMW Ad that we did is launching today. We have to be there within an hour Don't tell me that you forgot about it. I am coming. Mask Sir... Mask. The famous Tollywood star Mask. Each one is better than the others. Just put it on your face and become your favourite super star. Will you buy Mask, Sir? We have Megastar, Super star, power star, Rebel star, What ever you want just name it. No? You don’t want anything? Take this... It’s complimentary from my end. Today's bussiness went down the drain. Take the Mask. 300 crores were robbed in the Punjagutta bank. The robbery happened in the same bank... Just as yours. Look at the date. August 7th, 2018 Shit! This is old news paper... means that bank robbery which you did. Hey, move your vehicle. Rasool! Did you find him? - No. Welcome sir. This way. Please move. Please move. Side.. Please move. Side.. Please move. Excuse me... Side.. Please... Come let's go... Revengers... get ready. Revengers...? Revengers...? Sir please. Check once if all the channels are working. Who are you? Why did you come here? No. No.. Don’t cry. Where are your parents? One second... One second... Hello, security! Security! These guys never respond. I am here I'll handle it.. Where did your parents go? Oh, that way? Come... I’ll take you. I’ll take you. Very cute girl. Move.... move.... We don't have much time. Get done with this before he is back. Fast... fast... It's done. Let's go. Hello! Who are you guys? Why did you get in here? What are you doing here? Come on... tell me. Hello, security! Come here quick... two unknown people came to the AV room.. So you are the parents? Yes. We are Mummy and daddy. Mummy? Daddy. How can you leave this little child here? Shouldn’t you keep an eye on her? What’s this, Chinnu? You had us worried. By god’s grace, we found you. We are together now. You were born after so many stunts and sleepless nights. What do you say, Priya? Yes. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Take care her. Thank you. - Ok... ok. Ah, problem’s solved. What does 'stunts' mean? You are going overboard! Who? Me? He only said mom and dad in Telugu. You insisted on it in English. Just got carried away. Not carried away. You felt it. These are the feelings about me that are buried within you. Will you stop it? - Why would I stop? I am handsome. I don’t spray myself with perfume, I don’t go to the gym either. It’s all natural. Does that mean you would fall in love with me? Don’t try to seduce me and limit my potential. Stop! Stop this relationship dramas. Concentrate on revenge. From now on, “No love”, revenger. Only revenge... Revenge... Rev... Sir... we are extreamly sorry sir. It’s a small technical problem, sir. We should be ready in two minutes. Not feeling well... I am leaving. Talk to Rasool. You don't worry... I'll take care. I'll just be back - Ok sir. You too wear it. We didn’t get it. We left it at home. Someone is trying tell me that they found our building. Money...? Pencil, He is looking at us! Maybe he is. But he should figure out who we are. Ready revengers! - Ready. He will die of tension wondering who these people are... he doesn't have a Binocular, right? Granny! I think he is scared. Look at how he is running! Yeah, looks like that but... it doesn’t look like he is scared. We are on the fourteenth floor and Granny is also with us. He is coming towards us. Go! Get away from here! You need to leave from here urgently! Chinnu come... don't leave my hand. Where is Granny? I can't see her behind us. Granny! Why would you keep going in the opposite direction? Come.. Come..run.. Run... Why are you this slow? Are you waiting for him to catch you? Let’s go... run... Faster! Hurry! Come fast..! Fast. - Get inside. Come fast! What happened? - May be an overload. Where are you going? Keep your hands inside. Don’t get down anywhere in between, please. Keep going down. I’ll be right with you. Oh God! I am scared. Pencil. Oh no! There is a power cut. The lift has stopped! Granny... Hey chinnu! - Chinnu... What happened? Chinnu... What happened? Oh no! What happened? (Indistinct Voices) Dev...? You are the racer, right! Oh, my God! Chinnu... chinnu... be careful. Slowly. - Lift.. Lift... Lift... Sir... please just one selfie. Careful Priya. Sir. What actually happened? We got stuck in the lift. Oh...! She has a breathing difficulty due to suffocation. She was just scared. She is alright now. Make sure you don’t repeat these circumstances. See you. Chinnu... Baby... look at your granny, once. I behaved foolishly. I was stupid and thoughtless to take such a risk. I am sorry, Granny. It's not your mistake. I am the one who started it... I would be the one responsible if anything happens to your lives. Let’s end this here. No. Let’s end this here. I don’t want this revenge. Let's stop it. What is this, granny? We got this far because of you. And if you were to give up on this revenge now, Everything would go down the drain. Granny is right! By god’s grace, the child had a miraculous escape. This revenge... Enough. Let’s give up. It all started with their robbery, didn't it? If they were really considerate about the consequences of their actions on us, they wouldn’t have resorted to such an act. Who did they do this for? Don't know. I know. I know why they had to steep down to a robbery. All of the people involved in the robbery have no connection with each other Live in different localities of the city And have no criminal background as well. Why did they meet each other? Under what circumstances? What was the necessity that prompted them to commit this robbery. How did they meet Dev? I had these kind of doubts from the beginning. In Swasth care Hospital... this is the prescription given to your son. I found that in the abandoned building. I took the prescription and went to the same hospital to make an enquiry. And that is when I figured it out. Before they were killed, each of them discovered they were suffering from different type of Cancer. Can... Cancer? All of them met at the same hospital for the first time. They figured that they didn’t have long to live And they were worried for you women. Started to focus their attention not on their health.. But on your problems. They worried that if they died, Granny shouldn't face any difficulties. "Mom shouldn't be in trouble either." "My sister should study well..." "She should stay happy" "My daughter and my fiance shouldn’t suffer because of poverty." It was solely about securing your futures financially. They planned the robbery. And they met Dev at the same hospital. So, you knew this all along? Why didn’t you tell us earlier? They did this because... They didn’t want you to know. I just respected their decision. But why are you telling us this now? Granny and mom don’t want to seek revenge anymore. But without the motive of revenge, You wouldn’t have any business with me I would be left alone and lonely. I would be left alone as an orphan again. - Stop it! What’s with this nonsense? Where would we go leaving you here? We ourselves don’t have anyone. No one! Even if you scold us or throw us out... we won't go. Just missed them. That five women along with a guy. Exactly when I thought I got them... he set off the fire alarm All the money is with them for sure. Clear my schedule. We need to figure this out. How will you find who they are? How are you going to find out who they are? Regarding them, we don’t have a single clue. Rasool. What? Footage! He is the guy, Sir. Are you sure that he is the guy who took the ATM footage. Yes, Sir. Take the screen shot from video. Search for him on Google. Okay, Sir. (Mahishasura Mardini Stotram) Who is that banging the door? You have cleverly devised a plan and skill fully unmasked me. Do you think I wouldn’t be smart enough as well to figure out about you guys? Where is he? Where are the rest of them? Hey Old woman! Like cigarette smoke... Revenge is also injurious to health. What a beauty... unnecessarily it's getting wasted. He is a highly intelligent person. He can quite easily figure out about us. We have to delete the cc tv footage immediately. It might happen the way I wrote. Yes. It’s bound to happen the way you wrote it. Oh dear! How kind of you! He just stopped short of shooting Priya. Isn’t it? Why wouldn’t he? At his age.... The girl is quite beautiful... Yes... He would hesitate to shoot. That must be the cooker. I need to go. Go. How inconsiderate, granny! Recollect how much I helped you guys And yet, you guys push me into a muddle. We are helping you. You don't understand. We understand your anxious behaviour... And so does she... And that is why she left for the Pressure cooker. That cc tv footage? We have to delete it immediately. Oops. Santoor is upset. Can’t you see that I am sulking? What happened, Santoor? Don’t you know how many calls and messages I sent you? Did you respond to even one of it? It hurts. I am not in a position to reply. What happened? There is someone who has been stalking me for a month. Oops. Everywhere I go, he follows me. And, he asks me to commit to him. Commitment? Did you commit to him? Don’t tell me please. How would I do that santoor? If I am committed to a person, there is no turning back. He suspects us. He might come here to check on us. He would ask for the footage of the CCTV from my previous visit. Will you give it to him, Santoor? I already deleted that footage. Oops. I have to save my identity, right? Last time you came to see me, you held my hands. We have been physical. That is why, I deleted the entire footage. I didn't make any mistake, right Pencil? What about the current footage? Of course! With regards the footage, you don’t exist. But you exist in my heart, ok? I am not going to delete that. By the way, this is our second date. We are going steady. Hey, Pencil. We are going steady. We have to celebrate! Hello... Hello... Yes, I am the officer. I am the Chief Security officer. You have an ATM at Gachibowli, Road no. 64. Yes? Yes, we do. Did someone come by asking for the footage of that CCTV? I want the footage of the cc tv camera that recorded them, when they came to your office. It’s not possible. How is it not possible? They came and asked for the footage and took the footage of the ATM as well as their visit. They are a dangerous gang, sir. You are much better than them. You just held my collar. They beat me up. Apart from them, the one guy who came along with them Is even more dangerous. What does he look like? He must be 6 feet, sir. Or probably 2 inches shorter than 6 feet. He must have 6 pack abs Or probably missing 2 amongst them. He looks mighty... like a 'Hulk.' But like a less angry version of 'Hulk' He is intelligent, smart, Stylish and he’s got swag. Did he give you a name? Dev. He said about Dev. But he never said his name. He wants to catch the guy named Dev and they wanted to kill him. It’s a really big criminal gang. If they catch Dev, They are bound to kill him. How will they kill me? Not you, sir... someone called Dev. Sir... are you Dev? Hello... Dev, I found out where they stay Will Whatsapp you the location... come immediately. I am coming. Go on, sir. Sir... Sir... Sir... ¶¶Hey Pencil boy...¶¶ ¶¶You pricked me near my heart...¶¶ ¶¶ My he-man...¶¶ Hey, Pencil. Oops! What work do you have here, sir? When did you see them? The day before we lost the money and in front of our house, The five ladies of the same age..that you mentioned. And one guy. They waited in a blue ambassador outside our house. I thought they were your fans... So, I didn't take it seriously I brought the car with which you hit the transformer... to the nearby service station, I saw the blue ambassador here. They told me that they stay in this building on the first floor. How can you say that they both are same? - We saw them from afar Hey, Get down. (Mahishasura Mardini Stotram) Who? Are you dumb? Are you dumb is what I am aking you! How many times do I have to call you? There is something wrong with the TV. When I called you up to ask you to fix it, Won’t you sort the problem out immediately? What sir? You said you saw the six people, right? Is she the old lady from the gang? No.. No.. It can't be. There is nothing similar. Are you sure? That one was really sharp, but look at her. What’s with these hushed whispers? You at the back, I am talking to you. Look at him! He looks like a kidnapper of children. If you knock on my door again, I will kick you. Get out from here. Go.. Go... go... I have a lot of work and I want to watch the tv. Go on. Go on. Let's leave sir... I have a meeting at the bank There is a lot more work to be done. If they come to your bank again or if you see them anywhere, Inform me immediately I swear on you... i'll inform you. Dev... someone named Subramanyam who worked with you at the hospital Turn him away. D... D...Dev! Hey, Subbu! Come on in. Come... It’s been really long. How have you been? - I am good. How are you, Dev? - I am good, too. How is everyone back there? - They are all good. You know my sister, P.. Padma, right? She is getting married. It’s on the 23rd of this month. Please attend it. Ok. Ill check my schedule. - Please check... If possible, I will definitely be there. Just two minutes, Dev. You just have to make an appearance. I am always proud of your success. Someone who has worked with me and was able to achieve this kind of success. Just the other day, A reporter from Eenadu... He was persistently asking me about you and I sung your praises. Who? A journalist who was writing an article in Eenadu regarding the drivers of ambulance. What did he ask you? He asked if anyone of us suddenly came into money and built a house? Bought a car? I showed him your hoarding and told him about you. And that’s it... from then on, The entire interview was about you. 'Eenadu' did not publish any articles regarding this topic. He is fairly new to the job. Earlier, he wrote books. He has a weird name P... P...Pencil Parthasarathy It’s a really big criminal gang. If they catch Dev, They are bound to kill him. He...? Is that him? Yes. It is. All of us are ready to watch your dance performance. What about you, all set? All the best. Where is Priya? How is it? Okay? I don’t know how to put it in words even though I am a writer. Actually, women shouldn’t be this beautiful. It’s a crime Come closer. - What? Come closer. Granny doesn’t want to come to the function you go and talk to her. She listens to you... Did you ask me to come closer just to tell me that? I am not deaf... I could have heard that from a distance. Not fair. Granny... Granny... Granny, you told them that you don’t want to go. No... Not a chance. Get up and get ready. I have been feeling weak since last night. Really? I really have no patience. I can’t go with you. Hello! Our program is cancelled. We are all going to the hospital. I will call the orphanage and let them know. - No. No. No. Her teacher said repeatedly that our Chinnu is the lead performer. Nothing will happen to me mean while. All of you go. Ok. We will be back in 2 hours. We will go the hospital once we are back. Just take your medication and rest. Ok. Chinnu... Come on, Chinnu! Chinnu! Super! Chinnu! Super! Hi, Sir... Do you remember me? AV room, AD launch. What are you doing here? Earlier in the dance program, The one that looked dull, dark and greasy and danced the worst, that’s my son, sir. Oh... Is it? He looks like you. - Thank you, sir. But your daughter performed very well. - Thank You, sir. Sir? Did you plan for more kids Or are you satisfied with just one? I am ready... but she isn’t cooperating. Why don’t you convince her? Why Madam? Why do you want to take time? Two is company, Three is a crowd, madam. Why don’t you sit here and convince her? You please go... I'll convince her. Don’t think about anything else, Madam. Don't think about family planning... You should have children when the age is right Hello, who is this? You stole 150 crores from me and made a fool out of me. And you are asking me "Who is this"? Writer Pencil Parthasarathy. Dev.. Ok, I don’t have a lot of time... I am going to come to the point. In the eyes of the world, I am a big racer. Youth Icon... Sportsman of the year. They have called me many such things But my life from the inside... Do you know what the truth is? From the moment, I wake up... Up until the time I fall asleep I am constantly in fear I fear that the truth that I robbed the bank will come out and I would be caught by the police. I am anxious every minute of the day Suddenly at the point in time... You came. You showed me how I can get away from this fear. The connection between me and that crime is... That Money. That money... Is with you. The police have been searching for that 6th person Now I'll help them get to the 6th person. They have started towards your house For you. For the money that you stashed in your home. Pencil, come.. Let's watch the programme. What happened? - Nothing, I'll just be back. You stay here. OTP... Your transaction failed. What’s the matter? Listen to me. Hire a big truck immediately and take it to my house. Truck? Did the house owner throw you out? I told you numerous times to pay the rent. Shut your mouth and listen to me Take the books in my shelf and shift them elsewhere Why would you need to shift those thermocol sheets of books? They are not just thermocol sheets... Its money. Money? How much? 150 crores. 150 crores? From where did you get the money? We shall talk about it later. I will explain everything clearly to you. Just follow my instructions Immediately. Manikyam! Murthy, check why the vehicle has stalled. - Move your vehicle aside, man! Are you writer Pencil Parthasarathy? Yes, Sir. Go and check. - Ok sir. Don’t leave out any room. - Ok sir. Quick. What's happening, sir? Bank robbery. 300 crores For the past year, you tortured us. If even a single note matching the serial number is found, I’ll lock you up for the rest of your life. We looked everywhere sir... but we didn't find anything. How will you find them, sir? I am neither a thief nor a Benami... I am a writer. A really poor one. Look at those shelves inside I wanted to fill them up with books.. But unfortunately, I don’t have any money. I remembered while we are talking. I thought about writing on novel about this case... it seemed interesting. I researched on that case, someone would have suspected me and they would have informed you Now, I have to clean my house. Let's go. Where did we get the call? - It's an ananomous call. Inform to cyber cell immediately. Now a days every loafer is playing with the police like this. You bring them to the station and teach them a lesson. Hey, Bro... Thanks, buddy! No need for this sarcasm. We had a flat tyre. And that is why we are late. Where are the 150 crores? I have never seen that kind of money in my life. What do you mean? That’s one good for nothing truck Stop with these jokes... tell me the truth. That money is not mine. Why are you acting funny? How would I know? I just came. Granny! Granny... is at home. What happened? She is not well too. Granny. Granny. Granny. Granny. Even Granny's luggage is not here Ask around if anyone has seen her? Apparently some old folks went in a van. I asked about Granny ... and they said that they do not know. What’s that? One of those five men is a Christian. Varalakshmi, Priya, Swati, Chinnu... Chinnu's name is Srinidhi. Granny's name is Saraswathi. No one is christian among them. Everyone’s a Hindu. Where are you going? Hold this. John Stewart John! What happened? Orphan..! This has all the details regarding your five families. Would you really need a file to know about us? Rajaram has a mother Brahmam has a daughter Karthik has a sister Avinash has Priya. But john doesn’t have anyone. He is an orphan... like me. He was brought up in Orphanage home. John isn’t Granny’s grandson! Then has Granny been lying to us? I don’t understand. She is the one who sent the letters to the rest of others. She is the one who told the rest of them about me. She is the one who started and planned this whole revenge. Though she is in no way related to John, Why did she go through all this trouble? Who is Granny? She took it all. But she forgot something important. Madam... Just as you asked, We have distributed the money equally in these five bags. What do you want us to do with them? Place the five bags separately over there. Regarding what to do with them, I’ll tell you later. Okay. Partha...! I knew that you would find me. But how did you do it in such a less span of time. It's easy Granny... I saw you many times put money in the donation box of this old age home. A while ago your people's van had blocked my way. Leave all that... and first, give me a hug! Partha...! What great timing you have! Just before the police came over, You stuffed the bags with money and shifted them. Super, Granny! If the police found this money, we would be behind bars. But, there is something that I don’t understand. Why did hide the truth? Your grandson was not there in those five people who were killed. He didn’t kill just 5 people. He killed 6. Along with your husband We were married for 60 years. Even when he was 80 years old, He ran a bookstore on his own My husband was brutally murdered by that demon. That’s when I decided that the man should pay for his sins. I went to the police station every day to enquire about this case. Do you know what they said? "Granny! Your husband was 80 years old." "He is lucky to have survived this long. Leave the matter alone." "You are going to be on the way to deathbed soon anyways." "Is this really necessary?" That is how they criticised me and shooed me away. Everyone takes old people for granted. The children think that they are a burden The society thinks that we are a burden on this earth. Our death is similar to a street dog's death. No one cares about how we died or why we died. You asked me about why I hid the truth from you? If I told you that the one who died was my husband instead of my grandson, Would anyone understand my need to avenge him? Would anyone join me? No. That is why I lied In order to convince them. I got them to you. As soon as we had our revenge I thought of telling you guys the truth But in the meanwhile, I had fallen in love with all of you guys. For someone who never raised any children of her own to live amongst so many children Was something that made me realise how close I became to you guys. But that day, when Chinnu got stuck in the lift, I couldn’t handle the situation. And moreover, that criminal came home. That is when I decided Even if I couldn’t avenge my husband... I would ensure that no harm befalls any of you on my account. Even if you guys believed that I deceived you people and verbally abused me, I did this so that you guys would stop. That's why I have decided to give my money to Orphans and poor people like me. When you people forgot about revenge and were happy... Here... I packed your share of money into those five bags. I'll give them to you. Everything is fine. How has this become about money? Give that money. Give that money as well. From the begining there is no place for money in our Revenge. We got that unexpectedly and we kept it in our home. But we never thought about what to do with that money. I didn’t come here for money. I came for my granny. I used to live alone. All of a sudden, you women came into my life. I thought that I would write a story about you people.. That's why I accepted to help you. But, I am not selfish anymore. I am only filled with love. If there is a reason why an orphan has a great family... It’s because of you. Even if one of you goes missing, I don’t know what I would do. I need you with us, granny. Not just me. All of us need you. You must tell us stories You must scold us when we are wrong. You must strengthen us and guide us to survive just like you. I told them that you are here They are coming for you. Go with them. Chinnu asked for an ice cream I'll go and get that. Are you ok with strawberry flavour? They escaped. It’s pointless to try to frame them or let the police catch them You do know where they live, right? Go and kill them all. Leave none of them alive. Hello. Yes, this is Rasool speaking. Tell me, what's the matter? Rasool... What happened? Nothing, Dev. Nothing happened. What happened, Rasool? That is... I made a small mistake You asked me to call the police... and tell them that there is money in that writer’s house. In a hurry I called the police from my number. Apparently cyber crime traced my number. There is ... There is absolutely no problem, Dev. I took the SIM card with fake ID proofs. I threw it out. There won't be any problem. Ok, Fine. Give me the pen that’s in your pocket. Dev, seeing your angry... I was truly scared It isn’t hard for the police to come to me, Once they trace you. Can't they catch me? Sorry, Rasool. I didn't want to kill anyone... I didn't think the old Dev was needed anymore. But I couldn't avoid it. Because of a gang... no... no... because of one person... Infact because of one person from the gang. Who is it? One among the gang... One along the gang... One behind the gang... Damn this confusion, let's give it a name. GANG LEADER! How do you like it? You've got some guts, you landed in my garage directly. What else could I do? I have a Granny who visits the temple everyday... I have a mother, who goes to the market every morning. A girl I am in love with goes for her job. A college going sister and a daughter who goes to school. As long as you are alive I'll live with fear... every time they go out and come back. Is that needed? What if I get rid of you? You came alone to my Garage and talking about killing me? Where did you get this courage from? Do you know what is the long jump world record in the Olympics? 9 metres! We thought it's a quite a bit. But recently a man entered a lion's cage to feed it... only to realise that the lion was in close proximity and he had to jump to save himself. Do you know how long that jump was...? 10 metres! When the situation arrives, courage and strength are likely to come with it. When I used to see a man with a family earlier, I thought it only made him helpless... It is now that I realise... Family isn't a weakness, it's a strength. I am the man who'd sit in a room and plagiarize stories. How do you think I got the courage and come to kill you? I am still in the thriller genre Let's begin before I shift to being in the Serial Killer genre. What the hell are you going to start? Since you gifted me a family, I have a return gift for you. I'll make sure that the world doesn't know that you are the one who committed this crime. So Mr Dev, you'll die as India's N0.1 racer. Chinnu! - Look how well she is dancing? Chinnu! Where did you go? I went to buy ice cream for Chinnu. And I got late. Granny, told us everything that happened. And we need to tell you something important. What’s that? We decided to end this revenge. I am not sad that I lost a son God has given me another one. I don’t need this revenge now... No... Let him go. Karma will punish him according to his sins. I started this with the purpose of avenging for my brother. But I found my brother then, why should I bother now? The man who killed my dad is dead. India’s leading car-racer Mr. Dev... was brutally killed today evening in a fire accident that occurred In his own garage. He is dead, Granny. The one who killed my dad is dead. She .. She just spoke. Are you happy? - I am happy! Shall we have some ice cream? Yes. Let’s eat. My precious kids. Hey, come on move. What kind of a case is this? It's been torturing me since one and half year. How did this dog's leash get here? Sir, at the place of the robbery we found some unrecognised blood marks. We came to know that it's an animal's blood marks after we got it analysed at the forensic lab. The same day the robbers hit a dog with their van and killed it. This leash belongs to that dog. Sravani..! Did you findout who this dog belongs to? Ok, next... What's you name? - Suresh. Mr Suresh Ok, thank you. What's you name? - Phani. Phani? Funny name Next... Your name? Sukumar... I am a Telugu film Director. Hello, Sir. You are the Director of 'Dramaland' (Rangasthalam)...? 'Dramaland'..? Yeah, It's me. I don't watch a lot of telugu movies, It's mostly hollywood. What about this book? This is an original, based on a true story... my story. I really liked your book.. I want to adapt it for a film. Will you give me the rights for the story? Of course... why woudn't I? Before that you have to sign a copy for me. Definitely. This book is dedicated to My Granny, my mom, my wife, my sister, my daughter and Sravani.
