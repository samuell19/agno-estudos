[♪] At last we own a van Brocklyn. Oh, Walter, I'm so thrilled. Isn't it simply exquisite? It ought to be, it cost $50,000. Van Brocklyn, what a genius. And just think, the poor man died in poverty. He only died in poverty, from now on, I'll have to live in it. Oh, now, Walter, don't spoil everything. Run along and change, dear, like a good boy, our guests will be here any minute. Uh, beg pardon, madam. There's a leak in the plumbing. It's getting worse every minute. Oh, this is dreadful, Wilkes. How could I get a plumber over here at this hour? There's a new place on Elm Street, madam. The, uh, Day and Nite Plumbers, apparently they're on duty 24 hours a day. Thank you, Wilkes, I'll phone them at once. [PHONE RINGS] Nite and Day Plumbers. What's that, madam? A leak? Yes. Yes. Norfleet. 217 Linden Drive. Now, don't worry your pretty little head, we'll be over in two shakes of a martini. Ha-ha, boy. Our first case. Oh! Whoa. Why, you-- [LAUGHS] [GROWLS] [ENGINE STARTS] Come on, you slugs, we're rolling. [BOTH SNORING] Oh, stubborn, eh? Hey, come on, Shemp, it's our first call. Oh! [ENGINE REVVING] We gotta get a longer jeep. Hey, wait for me. Mr. and Mrs. Allen, so glad you could come. We're simply dying to see the van Brocklyn. Well, I'll not keep you waiting. In the living room, everybody. Oh, Wilkes, bring the cocktails. Very good, madam. [CHATTING INDISTINCTLY] [DOORBELL RINGS] Well? Day and Nite Plumbers. Yeah, come on, come on, where's the leak? I'm not the butler, he's in there. Well, lead on, pal. "Pal." Oh, it's divine. What color. What detail. And it's over 200 years old. Every museum in the country tried to buy it. It's a masterpiece, all right. I congratulate you. Thanks. Mr. Allen. Thank you. Oh, uh, the plumbers are looking for you. In the drawing room? They should have come around the back way. Thank you, sir. Look here, you men. Refreshments. Thanks. Ow! [GROANS] Oh, excuse me. Of course. How dare you come in here and mingle with my guests. Now, take it easy, lady, don't blow a fuse-- Never mind, give me that. I'll take yours too. The idea. Now, you, give me what you have in your hand. Here. Oh! Oh. [GASPS] Such impertinence. Wilkes, get them out of here and put them to work. Yes, madam. [IMITATING WOMAN] Get them out of here and put them to work. You heard what the gentleman said. Please, please. Here, here, here. The leak's in the basement. Go on, go on. It's practically fixed. [CLANGING NOISILY] They come in here to fix and leak and almost wreck the house, the clumsy idiots. [CLANGING] [LOUD CRASH] [GROANING] [GRUNTING] That's got it. Yeah, it's just a little soldering job. Hold on to this and don't let it slip. Okay. Get me that blowtorch. [SHOUTING] Oh. Get my foot outta there. Okay. Oh! [LOUD BANGING] Now, see what you did? What? Get outta here. Ow. Wait a minute. We can't fix it while it's leaking. I wonder where you shut the water off. It must be upstairs. Water always runs downhill. You're a very intelligent imbecile. Thanks. Yeah. Shut the water off! All right. Go on. I'll get the knife. Why, you-- Oh! Wet, ain't it? Heh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. [WATER RUNNING FAINTLY] [LOUD CLANGING] MAN: Ow! Sorry, buddy, you'll have to shut off that water. I beg your pardon. Come on, pal, or this will run into overtime. Come on. What'd I say? Never mind what you say-- Who are you? Who am I? I'm the plumber. Get outta here. "Who am I," thats... [CHUCKLING] Oh, stubborn, eh? Oh, it must be a loose washer. How do you like that? I'll fix up another. It's got to be a loose washer, or something. Oh. Oh, oh, oh! Ah. A great help you are. That other chowder head didn't shut the water off, now you do it. Here. Wait a minute. Where will I find the valve? That's your job, you dummy. Look in the kitchen, look in the attic. Look in the backyard. All right, all right. I'll let the water run out the window, that's what I'll do. Oh, yeah? Hm. [WHISPERING] It's a real van Brocklyn, all right. Worth a fortune. [WHISPERING] Okay, we'll watch our chance. I want you to meet my husband. Mr. and Mrs. Allen, Mr. Norfleet. Well, that's that. [GRUMBLES] I wonder where those other lugs are. All these pipes are full of termites. [SPUTTERING] That's got it. Now to get out. Moe. Larry. I'm trapped by the rising water, I'll be drowned like a rat. Oh, Moe! Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Now I'm using the old bean. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] Success at last. Just goes to show, you don't have to have brains to be a plumber. [LAUGHING] [SHOUTS] What's the matter? What's going on? Oh, murder! [LOUD CRASHING] You dimwit. What's the idea of dropping in without a calling card? Now look what you went and done. Go on, get another length of pipe. Go ahead. [GRUNTING] Hey, Moe? No wonder the water don't work. These pipes are clogged up with wires. Look. Well, yank 'em out and we'll hook the pipes up all over again. You oyster brain, go on. All right. No, we don't go in for sculpture, too bulky. We-- We-- Oh, dear. Oh. Is that--? I-- Heh, heh. I-- White, all colors. I thought-- [LOUD CRASHING] Short circuit, no doubt. [QUIET CLATTERING] [GRUNTING] [WHIRRING] That does it. End of the line. Okay. We'll try and get these pipes together and everything will be okey-dokey. All right. [POPPING] This house has sure gone crazy. I never thought I'd do it. Success. Ha, ha. I'll find this thing, or else. Dear me, I can't understand what's holding up dinner. Sorry, folks. Dinner's postponed on account of rain. Well, I'm-- I'm sure it won't be long. Shall we see what's on the television set? Uh, excellent. Uh, excellent idea. [CLEARS THROAT] [WHISPERS] Now. [GUESTS LAUGHING IN BACKGROUND] It's the very latest set, you know. We get the most amazing result. MAN [ON TV]: Good evening, friends. Well, that's-- That's odd. There's sound but no picture. Our special feature tonight will be glimpses of scenic America. First we take you to Niagara Falls. I-- I'll get it in a minute. Oh! Oh, dear! [GASPING] Clarabelle. You're all wet, darling. Oh, God. I-- I saw you television people! It's realistic, isn't it, darling? [CRYING] MR. ALLEN: Never in my day. Madam, shall I get you some water? No! Oh-- Oh, my painting, it's gone. Nobody leaves the house. Sorry, just a formality. I'll call the police. Who--? [CHOKING] Op-- Operator? What-- [WHEEZES] [GASPS] You folks going somewhere? Just looking for a drink of water. Turn on anything, you'll get it. He's gone. We can't make it out that way. We'll be searched. Yeah. Yeah. They won't find anything. I'll slip the picture in here till the excitement blows over. Anything, anything, hurry. I'll get back to the rest before we're missed. Yeah, okay. Give me that pipe, I got you covered. Oh! Oh. Oh. Whoa. Whoa. Mrs. Norfleet, the only strangers in the house are those plumbers. They must have taken your painting. Of course. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go find them! Thieves. There's one of them. Take it easy, folks. I'm just a beginner. Come, follow me! I'll take the damage off the bill. Take it easy. [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Easy. Easy. I'll take-- A hole in the floor like this can be dangerous. Oh! All right, sonny boy, the pipe. Come and get it. [SCREAMING] Get up outta there, you. There. There's the guy that took your picture. Where is it? Where is it? Stop it. No guest of mine would steal that painting. Of course not, this man's out of his head. Drop that pipe. If I took that picture, may I be struck by a bolt from the blue. You heard me, drop it. [LOUD CLANGING] There it is. Look! Wait a minute. Stand back, everybody. Hey. [COOK SCREAMS] And if you wanna keep on living, count to a hundred before you move. One, two, three-- Wilkes. [SHOUTS] [LOUD CRASHING] [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Get him up! Get up, bucket head. Get that gun. Easy-- I've got you. Wilkes, call the police. WILKES: Police? Police, police. What would you charge to haunt a house? How many rooms? Huh? Quiet. Look at me, I got the other one. Keep going, sister, I'll knock your brains out. Go ahead, take her. Oh, no you don't! [ALL SHOUTING] Stop it! Come here! The police will take care of this. Madam. Here's your picture. Oh. My painting. Name your reward and you shall have it. We don't want no reward, lady. What are you saying? You heard him, we don't want no more money. No, it'll put us in a higher tax bracket. I'll bracket your head. [LOUD CRASHING AND CLANGING] [ARGUING INDISTINCTLY] [♪]
