- I built a hand grenade in class today. ﻿- Okay. - ﻿But it was a bit of a failure. - Why? ﻿It just looks weird ﻿and doesn't fit in any of my pockets. - I'm going to give mom the big fish. ﻿- I'm going to give dad the big fish. ﻿You can't, if I'm giving it to mom. ﻿- It's my fish too. ﻿- But I caught it. ﻿With my fishing rod. ﻿Then I'll cut it in half. - ﻿How are you going to do that? ﻿- With my pocket-knife. ﻿Mom won't be happy. - Wow! Oh my god! - Shit. ﻿That was amazing. ﻿Dad, wasn't it supposed to ﻿fall to the other side? ﻿That is nice. ﻿Okay, now it's my turn. ﻿Shit, this is high. Don't be scared. ﻿I went a lot higher than that. No. Yes, I did. ﻿I'm just as high. ﻿Are you going to jump or what? ﻿Calm down, what's the hurry? ﻿There, there, is that good? ﻿Gotcha! ﻿There we go. ﻿Wanna eat a flower? ﻿You poor thing, you're okay. It's okay. ﻿Calm down calm down.. ﻿There we go. ﻿I won! - You little shit! - Stop it. You have to be careful because this ﻿could cut your head off or something. ﻿Okay.

No. ﻿I want one. ﻿I have nothing to do ﻿with some shitty Vespa. ﻿Did you know that vespas were made ﻿for old people that can't walk? ﻿I know. ﻿And they are still made for ﻿old people who can't walk. ﻿Not true. Other people and ﻿kids ride vespas also. ﻿Listen, they should be used by ﻿old people that can't walk. ﻿I know that. ﻿It's stupid to see kids thinking ﻿they are mega cool riding it. ﻿Look at me, I'm mega cool. ﻿If you could choose an ﻿animal or a bird for a pet... ﻿- What bird would you choose? - ﻿A puffin. - ﻿A puffin? - ﻿Really? Not me. ﻿They shit too much. Shit, it's shaking! - Are you scared? - No. ﻿Hey, I found a skull ﻿in the ditch. ﻿Great. ﻿- And pull! - ﻿Yes, wait. ﻿Quickly, quickly. ﻿Shit, this is heavy. ﻿Pull, pull, pull. ﻿My hand is killing me. ﻿We better not knock our heads into this. ﻿Okay boys let's do this. ﻿Well done! - I think I can lift it on my own. ﻿- Yeah right. ﻿You ready? ﻿Yes, pull. Go on, we can do this. ﻿Almost there. ﻿Yes, pull. I got this. ﻿Great. ﻿Urgh, so cold. ﻿This snow is pathetic. ﻿It's so dry. ﻿Dad! ﻿Dad! ﻿Dinner is ready! ﻿What's wrong with you? ﻿Are you an idiot? ﻿No. ﻿- Shit, you're so annoying. ﻿- You started it. ﻿Hey, dad says we're not supposed ﻿to climb over the fence. ﻿What am I supposed to do? ﻿You threw my hat you idiot! ﻿Be careful. ﻿Do you think you're alive? ﻿No, you're dead. ﻿Fix that down there. ﻿Done. ﻿It's starting. ﻿Quick, quick! ﻿This is amazing! ﻿Woah!! ﻿Shit this is loud!

Pull it. ﻿Well done. ﻿Master. ﻿I'll hold it. ﻿Do you think it's a nice bridge? ﻿Yeah, it's okay. ﻿Do you think I'm strong? ﻿No. What? ﻿Give it to me. ﻿Wow, nice bridge. ﻿Are you really going ﻿to pull me up there? ﻿Yes, but we have to tie you first. ﻿Okay. ﻿- Hello? Can I get more rope? ﻿- No problem. ﻿Thanks. ﻿One, two, and go! ﻿Shit you're heavy. ﻿One, two, and... - ﻿﻿Are you okay? - Yes, I think so. ﻿Sorry! ﻿Be careful, don't drop me! ﻿You also need to pull. ﻿Nearly there! ﻿Was it hard? ﻿Yes, my hands are kiIIing me, ﻿I think I'll get rope burns. ﻿Wow, you've made it really nice. - ﻿And the guy on this bow boat... ﻿- It's called a rowboat, not a bow boat. - ﻿Sorry, a rowboat. ﻿- Bow boat...
