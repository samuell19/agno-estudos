Good afternoon, Los Angeles. Today's weather report shows another beautiful day with sunny skies but a low pressure indicates a dramatic drop in temperature later on. We have breaking news for you at this hour. Shit, shit, shit. Real talk, LA has the highest number of unarmed men and woman of color being shot by cops, on the daily, than any other city in the county. Because developing a strategy to repair race relations between communities of color and the LAPD is a top priority. Shit. Los Angeles, 911. What's the exact location of your emergency? Yeah, this cop, this cop he got shot. I haven't been out of the house for 16 minutes and you're already riding me about some stupid Facebook picture. The LAPD shouldn't be taking selfies with half naked socialities and Venice beach muscle types. Requesting a backup patrol car at Hollywood and Gower for a 148. Baby, it's just a stupid picture. Ma'am, ma'am, calm down. Did you say an officer... Yeah on the corner of Van Nuys and Burbank Boulevard. Are you with the officer now? He needs help. Help is on the way, ma'am. - Just send an ambulance! - Ma'am, calm down. Did you say... And I didn't even want to take it but Joel's on this whole play nice with the community bullshit so they asked for a picture with them and we took it. And now they've tagged you on Instagram and Facebook. Birthday gift, I suppose? Come on, Manny, you're taking this too seriously. Oh come on. Manny, I am just busting your balls. All units, we have a 10 double zero at the corner of Burbank Boulevard and Van Nuys. Makes me wonder what else you - and Joel have been doing. - 10 double zero. Manny, Manny, quiet. Liquor store Burbank Boulevard. Corner of Burbank Boulevard and Van Nuys, all units. Oh damn it. Manny, I gotta go. Answer the phone. Shit. Hey, chick. Hey, yo I think this dude is dead, Nikki. Oh, you ended up killing Mike after all? - No, not Mike, a cop. - Good, girl. I killed him. I didn't kill him, he just might be dead. I don't know. - It all happened so fast. - Wait, wait, what? I got pulled over by this cop and... Okay, well tell me what happened. He asked me for my license and registration and I just, I don't know, and he spazzed the fuck out for no reason and he started pointing his gun at me and he told me to get out the car and it's just. Damn, Cretia, are you okay? I can't lose my son. Oh my god. I can't! You're not even on that shit no more so don't even think like that. Come to my crib and we'll figure it out, okay? I won't lose Bobby. Let me just. Wait, all this went down in the car? Yeah, I'm sorry, Nik. I promise, I'm not trying to mess up your shit. If that's a yes that just means the video camera recorded it, you did have the damn thing on, didn't you? Oh I forgot about this stupid camera. Help is already on the way, sir. Are you with the officer now? Uh, so it seems. Check his pulse. Do you know CPR? I know nothing about saving a life. I need you to check his pulse. Put two fingers on his wrist and see if you feel anything. Does he have a pulse? Uh, yeah but it doesn't seem like he's breathing. - I - need you to do CPR until the ambulance arrives. Yeah, I'm not sure that's for me. Place your hands on top of each other in the middle of the chest, push hard, push fast. - All right. - one, two, three. Let me hear you counting. One, two, three. Listen to me. One, two, three. That's the world problem. Nobody listens. I got to figure out how to replay a video on this thing. Get your paws off that camera. That's your lifeline, girl. I got to pick up Bobby from after school by five. Why don't you just call Mike and have him pick him up? I can't call his ass. He said if I miss one more pickup, he was gonna like... You don't have a choice. Call him then head to my crib. I'ma call David while you doing that, okay? Look, don't be scared, Cretia. You know I got your back no matter what, right? Yeah, chick, I know. Hi, baby. Uh no, I'm just talking to a client. - So how as San Diego? - Fuck. Oh no, no, no. Out of the way. Out of the way. Oh come on, Joel. Okay. This shit can't happen today, partner, all right? It's my birthday, remember? Happy hour at O'Brien's. Somebody shot him in the lower abdomen. Come over here and help. Now! Put your hand on his lower abdomen. Hang in there. You know those pictures got Manny mad as hell. Now, put your hands here and press. All right. Come on, come on. All right, keep going. Hey, put the phone down. Man, that's bullshit. This cop just pushed my phone away. Get back. Put the phone down. Hey, this is not a music video. Hey, hey. Handle this. - Get back. - Get them out. What is up, mi gente? I'm Lola G and welcome to Hola Lola news. This is where you all can get what is popping first and let me tell you, y'all's Facebook Live is actually on fire right now. It is filled with all this news about an officer who was shot less than half an hour ago. So if you're looking for some fresh, hot off the news press live feeds make sure you head over to my website Hola Lola News. Hey, partner, hang in there. I'm right behind you. You're gonna be fine. I need to get my hands on that dash cam video. New procedures, remember? Only jerk offs with clearance. Than who can I jerk off? 'Cause I need that footage. Hey, you and I need to tango. Uh, is this to catch up or a precursor to an arrest? Yes. Even after I performed my civic duties? Put the phone down, put the phone down. Is that thing on? Stay the fuck back. Personal property, officer. I have a constitutionally protected right to document police activity. If there is anything on that contraption that shows what happened to my partner than the only right you have is to remain silent. Okay, okay, okay. When I got here, the beginning of the movie had already happened. He was lying on the ground and the coast was clear. Now, let me warn you. There is some facts and some, you know, hashtags. Everything from blue lives matter to all lives matter to, you know, black lives matter on there and some of the shit that you're gonna find is from some racist, ignorant rednecks while some of it is from some gun toting record felony holding straight out blunted thugs but you know what I have to say to both groups? To hell with you, all right? I'm interested in connecting with people who want to learn. So if that's you and me, gente, then make sure you head over to HolaLolaNewspuntocom because I got you covered. Camera working, yes. Police car, nothing else. Okay, so what about the ones pointing towards the alley? Nothing. Mr. Chen, I know you don't want to let a cop shooter get away, now do you? No, no, no. Me no want. Okay, good. So think again and which one is gonna show me what I'm looking for? I tell you. Only police car, look. Anything? What did you hear? I have a police man shot right outside your back door and you didn't hear anything, not even a shot? Okay, if you're protecting someone... If you're afraid, Mr. Chen, we can protect you and your wife. How many times I have to say we see, hear nothing? - Jesus. - Okay. Well piss on me, Mr. Chen, and tell me it's raining and I start to lose my patience. I could haul both your asses down to the county jail where they could help jog your memory, huh? What about your wife? Nothing. All right, then I'm sure you wouldn't mind offering us your hard drive to take with us, right? Thank you for being a good citizen, Mr. Chen. Come on. No, Cretia. I'm not picking him up. You know, I'm sick of this. The custody agreement requires you to get him three times a week and one weekend I'm off. What part of that is a struggle for you to understand? Mike, I'm not gonna do this shit with you right now, man. If I could pick him up I would. Do you hear yourself? You pick up passengers for a living and you can't even pick up your only son. I drive all fucking day and night to help take care of our son. I know and right now I'm with a patient who I just can't walk out on. Are you gonna get him or not? Not. Pick him up on time or get the hell out of his life for good. You fucking serious right now, Mike? Just because I can't him from after school this one day? No, most days, Cretia. Most days that you're supposed to. You know, it was so much easier for him when you were in prison. At least he knew you weren't coming. I hate you. You know that? I gotta go, sweetie. He'd be glad to know you're here. I can't wait to tell him about the shit Manny gave me for that stupid Facebook picture. What picture? Oh, it's just a stupid picture. Just something from one of our beats, it's nothing. Wait, wait, wait, Sarah. You got to be in this shot. - No, I'm not interested. - You got to be in the shot. Uh, sir, could you go ahead and take this shot so my partner can be in it? Thank you very much. Just, come on. Party pooper, let's do this. All right, everybody say LA baby! Hard to explain to a three year old that her father may die. You don't. You don't, he's not going to, okay? Ready when you say. One, two, three, go. Reporting live... I believe you call this in your language breaking news worthy. Comes with a hefty price tag. Did you record the actual shooting? Let me see it. Let me see the full video. I don't go all the way on the first date unless it's with the boss. Or you know I could just, you know, use it to multiply my thousands of social media followers and generate advertisement revenue but you know, the slow game is just not as appealing as a deep pocket pay out. Wait, wait, wait. Let me talk to my boss. What's your name? JJ. - JJ? - Yeah. So you were here when it happened? Yeah. Hey, captain. Sarah. Have you been briefed on the blind spot in the security camera for the liquor store? How are we supposed to chase the bad guys when we have to wade through political bullshit just to see the dash cam footage? Let's talk politics after we catch this prick. Why was Joel on the beat solo? You know how Joel is, something gets in his head and forget about it. Joel's idea of public service was to prove to the community that he felt comfortable riding alone. Ride now the picture is still not clear what happened here today but what we do know is that a police officer was shot outside of Sunny Liquor Store on Burbank Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. This is usually a very quiet corner but the shooting occurred in the back alley which might explain why we have no eye witness or no one has come forth yet. I did have the opportunity to speak to some of the locals and here are their reactions. It was terrible. Who would shoot an officer, you know? They give their lives for us everyday. Honestly, that's karma and now you know how we feel. These people is here to protect and to serve. Now, I do believe that the communities and the police they have to come together. Clearly emotions are running high between the community and the police. There is a trust issue that still remains to be resolved. Recording live from Sherman Oaks, Tanya Ayala. Thank you, Tanya and we will continue to bring you updates as this shocking police case develops. When we come back, an exclusive interview with the first witness on the scene of the police shooting today. Stay tuned. Hi, JJ? Hello, Kate. Hey, I've been a fan of yours since I... Tanya told me you have video of the shooting you want to share with us. I wouldn't share more like sell and I never said it is of the actual shooting. Did you shoot him? Hell no. I mean of course not. Not having the actual shooting is an instant loss of value. However, one still can't discount the value of doing CPR on a shot cop. Wait, you did CPR? Saved his life. Who the hell is she talking to? Holy shit. Let's scarp the telephone interview and do face to face. No deal, Kate. I need the telephone interview to go viral and help increase... I mean help give my followers a heads up about the face to face. If you're bullshitting me - for some 15 minutes of fame. - Kate, Kate. I am about that lit life on social media I need more than 15 minutes to achieve my American dream. I got bills to pay, Kate. If you have what you say you do, we'll buy your video. As long as the price is fair, you got yourself a deal. All right, get me the operator. That kids got something actually interesting. Man, why you pulling me over? You know. If I knew I wouldn't be asking. Failure to make a complete stop. Man what you talking? Man, I did stop. License and registration, please. License and registration. Hey, what are you doing? Stop right now, stop. Keep your hands where I can see them and get out of the vehicle. Look, man. You asked me for my registration. Get out of the vehicle now. Do it. Come on, get out! Keep your hand where I can see them. Let's go, come on. Get out of the vehicle. Stand over here. You doing way too much - right now. - Stand over here. Turn around. Shut up right now! Shut up right now! Turn around, put your hands behind your neck! Spread your god damn legs! Shut up now and do it! Do it now! Oh my goodness this. This shit is not for real. You know what? A body search man for a stop... Shut up now! Hey, get your hands off of me, man. - Am I under arrest? - Hey shut up. Stop resiting. - I aint resisting shit. - Get you hands behind your neck and stop resisting. Somebody help me. Somebody help me! Everybody keeps asking where the fuck the dash cam and the chest cams are but come on, America, us brown and black folk we know that police video don't mean shit. How many times have we actually seen a police officer set up a scene to make it look like he's innocent or even better, when they actually they have the evidence to prove him guilty in court, they make sure that it's inadmissible or my personal pet peeve is when they simply get to walk away because they're white. This better be life threatening. You called me 15 times. I'm calling in a favor for Cretia, she needs your help, she thinks she shot a cop. And? Yeah, and. We need your help. We need a lawyer. No, she needs a lawyer. That's what the fuck I said. Look, this is her now. I'ma three way us. Hold on. Are you out of your damn mind, Nikki? If Lucretia did what she said she did then they can charge you with aiding and abetting a fugative and not think twice about it. She has a video that proves she's innocent. And you've seen this tape? Just as I thought. Here's my advice. Don't take another call from her and if you know anything about a potential cop shooter, call the cops. You've been warned, cuz. I'm out. And that's what so fucked up about this country. Everybody has a huge mouth and a huge voice and frankly a huge everything but aint nobody listening to nobody and that's the problem. Except one. You, you guys are actually listening. Those of you who have followed here at Hola Lola News since the beginning know what's up and together we're gonna make sure that the world knows that the truth is the only real hero. Hey yo, I've been calling, what you on? You are gonna be late. Yeah, I know, man, and Mike's gonna bitch about them late charges. It aint good, Cretia. That pig died? No, no. But it's allover the news. Yeah, social media is lit with this shit. Listen, I reached to somebody I think can help. You ever heard of Hola Lola News? So I guess David told me to go fuck myself, huh? She's this YouTube influencer who has all these followers. She's realer than a motherfucker when it come to shit that's happened in the hood. She might be able to help you tell your side. So you telling me you want me to trust some bitch I don't know? No thanks. Man what did David say? He said call the police. What the fuck? You called the police? Bitch, you gonna ask me some shit like that? All I know is you trying to pass me off to some YouTube chick. What the fuck? And I know why you doing this shit so you and your bae can keep living lifestyles of the rich and fucking famous. Uh huh, see, hold on. First of all, that's not my bae, that's my husband and second, don't be mad at me 'cause your husband divorced your ass. Bitch, fuck you. No, bitch, fuck you. Shit, whatever. I'm gonna go get my son. I'll work this shit out on my own. I don't need you. We have JJ on a live call and the good Samaritan from Los Angeles who performed heroic CPR measures on a cop shot this morning. Thanks for speaking with us exclusively, JJ. The pleasures all mine, Kate. There's no one I'd rather be talking to than my competent counterparts at HRS. Tell us about the scene when you arrived at the liquor store. First, for my viewers, you guys can follow me at JJ video king on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram. Okay, so about the liquor store. I'm trying to quit cigarettes, so I'm only smoking menthols and Sunny's has the cheapest ones and so I was there, that's when I saw the black and white unit and this body on the ground and uh, so I, no, I turned on my GoPro cam and after I called 911, of course, and then I started CPR. Wait, JJ, your recorder was on before you started CPR? That's what I'm trying to tell you, Kate. JJ video king always has videos worth watching. Mario, are you watching this kid on channel three? Who the hell is that kid? Chief, that's the kid that helped Sarah with CPR and then he disappeared. How the fuck did we get to the point where we can't see dash cam video but assholes like this get spots on Good Afternoon America? Captain Green. Captain, we got the license plates. Got it. Put out an ABP. Let's get this perp without a social media frenzy. You know, I'm not the same tech guy as I once was. These damn gadgets are insane. I believe in you. It's not as easy as you think. But not impossible? Nothings impossible. I knew you had my back. Yeah. Attorney Schiffern. Hi, this is Michael Sanders. Listen, Lucretia called me at the end of day, she's not gonna show up again. You know, she hasn't complied with any of the temporary custody agreements and it's been a year. She's irresponsible. For all I know, she could be going back to her hook or crook lifestyle. I don't trust her with my son. I'm about ready to terminate the agreement. I want full custody of Bobby. Please, call me back as soon as you... Stay back, stay back. Back. Hey, stay the fuck back bro. - Why, you can't film you? - Because I said so. Film nothing. Whoa. All right, here's the obvious. We have the right to record wherever the fuck we want but what about the not so obvious, all right? Do we actually have the right to interfere with the police investigation and should that pendajo have moved back when the police asked him to? Yo, hit me up with your thoughts real talk at Hola Lola News. Okay. Hey, show me your hands! Hands up! Turn off the vehicle now. Turn it off! Turn off the vehicle now! Step out of the car, ma'am. What is this about? Shut up! Turn around. Hands on the car. Y'all got the wrong person. It wasn't me. Shut up! My lawyers gonna have a field - with y'all. - Shut your mouth. Your under arrest in the connection of a shooting of a police officer. - It wasn't me! - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney present. If you can't afford an attorney one will be appointed to you. Ow, man, that's tight! Shut up! I'll show you tight. Really, just like all through my bushes and my flowers? I think you got more to worry about than your bushes and your flowers. Get in, shut up! That's a hell of a hefty price tag to pay for a video you haven't even seen yet and besides we're already covering the shooting on the ground and I've already got the chopper airborne. But fresh exclusive footage of a cop dying in the streets of LA is exactly the edge we need. The political fallout we're gonna get we don't need. It's the ratings I'm in bed with. Kate, we're over budget and the ratings are so high that it wouldn't satisfy upstairs anyway. I thought I was looking at upstairs. There's always another floor. That is the one thing I love, y'all, about a street warrior, baby, 'cause they get the four uno uno so I can bring it to you live and bringing it to you first. Big shout out to ride or die underscore four who got the name of the cop shot. Check this out, by reading the name on the name plate. All right, so here's the deal. Live and exclusive for you, it's Officer Joel Murphy, 45. Tell me the unthinkable thing I need to do to hear yes. Hey, guys. Lola News just released the name of the cop. How the fuck did we let that happen? Fuck. We need this, Shadow. We need it. No, Kate, you need this. I'm not gonna let your ego run this news room. I know exactly what you're after. Now get back to your desk, let me do my job and I'll let you do yours. Fine. Magic touch, Kate. I have some pleasant news to share. My social media is on fleek. I foresee some significant YouTube revenue in my very new future. There's not enough meat on your bone to get the network to fork over the cash. I can offer you a news bite. 10, 20 seconds. Enough to shock the audience. After we air it, you can sell the video anywhere else for the juicy price you want. That's the only deal I'm offering and you've got 30 seconds. Well? Short change my 15 minutes of fame? That's conduct unbecoming, Kate. Okay. Deal. How soon can you get it to me? As soon as you open your front door. Wow, y'all these mofos sure know how to spend our money here in LA. I mean you got kids out there with outdated books and streets that are just shot to shit but then you got Officer Joel right here, check him out, and he's buying cervesas and you know buying things for girls with fake tits and tiny waits. Clearly, LA's fucking finest, don't you think? Officer Joel Murphy has a degree in criminal justice. After serving as a San Jose reserve police officer. He has extensive training in criminal investigation, drug law enforcement, and crime scene processing. He's a devoted husband and father. I mean, this is one of LA's finest. Damn, mi gente. That is one hell of a grip he has on mamacita but don't trip, all right. Officer Joel is definitely not the first and certainly not the last to get loco with the ladies. So let's not jump to any conclusions here and real talk, I'm not trying to throw any shade. I'm just trying to get down to the facts of what the hell happened out there with Officer Joel Murphy. Which reminds me, if any of you all have information that's credible and real, then definitely slide into my DM, I'm waiting to see it. And now, the exclusive footage we promised from today's shooting of Officer Joel Murphy, currently in critical condition at Burbank medical center. Please welcome JJ. Our locals new catcher who captured the incident himself. JJ, welcome to the show. Let's take a look at that footage. So, JJ, talk us through how you were feeling at this point, I mean presumably this is an intense situation to find yourself in. Right, yeah, yeah. It was intense. When I showed up I had no idea actually what was going on and so I was kind of in a state of shock but you know instincts kicked in and so, I saw this police officer on the floor and called 911 and uh, as you can see here, the 911 operator instructs me on exactly how to do CPR. Have you ever done anything like this, do you have any kind of medical training? No medical training at all. I was just this guys, this is not supposed to be shown at this time, remember? Right? This was not... We're live, take over the situation. If you can please have a seat. I mean this is important footage. If you could please turn this video off. You know, I. - I know that our... - You were the only one there. Only one there and I know that our millions of viewers are really gonna want to recognize our local hero. - Absolutely. - I mean, - you helped save. - Get him back now! An officer's life today, right? Please, please come back, JJ. Let's talk, let's talk about this. Let's tell our audience what actually happened out there. Yeah, yeah okay. Um. Yeah, okay. You helped save an officer's life today. I mean, how does that make you feel? I don't know how it makes me feel. You know, it just all happened so fast and so, uh. Did you say hero earlier? - Yes, JJ. - Of course. - A hero. - Yeah, so I guess I just did what any decent hero would do in that situation. Well, I think you're pretty incredible. - Thank you, thank you. - For keeping calm. Thank you, thank. And I also want to let you guys know this incredible can be brought to you by, or is brought to you by JJ video king and you can find me on Facebook. - Thank. - Instagram, Snapchat. Thank you, JJ, thank you. Thank you very much. Obviously a story that continues to develop and we will have full coverage throughout the day. We'll be right back with more news. Feel free to swab these for residue. I've never even held a gun. See, I know that messes with your stereotype and all. You picked me up leaving a three million dollar house driving a 85 thousand dollar car but you want to put me in a back ally in LA? Nah, ma. That aint gonna fly. All right. Then tell me the name of your bae, this dude that's driving around in your SUV. What is it, his credits jacked so you put the car in your name? There you go again with the stereotypes. I'ma let my attorney answer that one when he gets here. You good with that officer? The LAPD Police Captain, Ken Green, has been working with the Department of Justice Task Force for the past year to address the rise in crime in the city. Officer Joel Murphy is in critical condition and continues to fight for his life. Meanwhile, we've put out an APB on a suspect and in order to keep the public safe, we are withholding any details for now. Every unit in the city is on alert and the governor appointed liaison is working on the dash cam footage. As soon as it's available, we'll release it to the public. Meanwhile, we're all running around with targets on our back and that's the reason that our relationship with cops has gone to shit. Honestly that's why I'm over there praying to hoping that the truth prevails sooner than later. Can I bum a smoke? I'm still deciding whether or not I should tweet to my millions of followers that your a wolf in sheep's clothing. Social media can be a beast when it wants to be. Smoking menthols makes you sterile, did you know that? Tell that to my beautiful two month old baby girl. Two months, huh? Congratulations. I checked your social media accounts, JJ. Insignificant. You woke up this morning a loser, now you're a hero. Cheer up, dad. I take my money matters seriously, Kate and right now you're messing with my baby girl's future. I can't give that damn footage away now that you've shown it to everybody. Just pay me what you owe me so me and my faithful GoPro can get back out there. That's your bike? Yeah. Hold on. I'll be right back. I'm here with Mr. Chen. He's the owner of Sunny Liquor Store where right outside here Officer Murphy got shot a few hours ago. Mr. Chen, so you say that Officer Murphy is one of your regular customers, is that right? Yes, for the last five years he comes in every morning for his coffee and breakfast burrito and then he comes back in the same day sometime, too. He's reason why crime so low in my store. He's always around. He's a good cop. I'm guessing you made the call about the kids video. Damn news editors, what are you gonna do? What about paying him? Come on, man, the kids got a two month old baby girl. Kate, it wasn't the actual shooting, we need more. Come on. Afternoon. Man why you pulling me over? You know. Welcome to law firm. For Espanol All right, y'all, so everybody knows that shooting a cop is bad business for everyone. So I for one certainly hope that they get down to the truth and find the shooter. Regardless of what color the person is. But here's what's up. I got to warn my black and brown mamis and papis out there because there is an ABP out which means one thing and one thing only, we are all guilty until proven innocent. So if you can, stay home, stay under covers because girl, and man, if you are out there they are gonna pull you over based on racial profiling. You all know what I'm talking about and you know it's real. Ah shit, looks like I pissed off some great Americans citizens. Messages are coming in fast and furious. But you know what, America, welcome to Hola Lola News. I aint scared of you 'cause you know what, real talk, it is time to make America smart again. There are your parents. Bye. Bye, Bobby, take care. - Bye, teacher. - Bye. - What's up, bud? - Hey, Dad. You're late. Yeah, we gotta go. Come on. I got it. It's 5:30, you're late again. I canceled two clients. Man, that's on you. You said you couldn't pick him up. And you said work it out. What is your problem? No more of this, Cretia. No more what? Me working my ass off? You know except where it concerns, Bobby. Los Angeles 911, what's the exact location of your emergency? Yes, I'm a teacher here at Valley Elementary and one of my kids just got picked up by his parents and I'm noticing a domestic dispute. - Okay. - I'ma see you soon. Give me a hug. I love you, sweetheart. I love you, too. Hey what's up, man? Hey. All right, all right. How was class? - Good. - Good, all right. License and registration? 7-0-1-40 roger 7-8-5, a family dispute. 4972 West 23 Street, Valley Elementary School. Today's your lucky day. The recording encrypts every frame before uploading it to the LAPD cloud server. All I was able to do was to extract some of the date from the digital magnets. Come on, get out! Keep your hands where I can see them, let's go. Come on. Get out of the vehicle. Stand over here. You doing way - too much right now. - Stand over here! - Turn around. - You done pulled... - Shut up right now! - Why you got... Shut up right now and turn around and put your hand behind your neck. - Stop sign? - Spread your goddamn legs. Shut up now and do it! - Criminal. - Do it now! Oh my goodness, this... This shit is. You know what? A body search? Stop now! Hey, get your hands off of me, man. - Am I under arrest? - Stop resisting. Hey, you're recording this shit? - You know what? - Jesus Christ. I got some shit for you. She shot him, Cap, in cold blood. Okay, so his protocol was a little bit off. You breaking protocol and taking his body cam or Joel and his fucking frisky fingers? She got pissed and she took his gun and she shot him. That makes this premeditated. Baby, I just, I have something really important that I need to take care of and I will be back for you. As soon as I get this stuff right. So, for now, you listen to your daddy, okay? He's a good man. I gotta go, baby. I love you so much. Mama loves you, baby. Step out of the vehicle. Step out of the vehicle. Shit. This is a 10-42, request for backup. Tell me, why? 'Cause y'all keep asking me the same damn questions, yo. Okay. Okay? - What time did he... - Man can a lady get a bathroom break around here or something? I'ma wait for my attorney. Well the minute that he walks through that door we will no longer be playing in the sandbox. I will not need you. Look, Nicole. This is a video, Nicole. Wake the fuck up! Help me bring her in. Are you crazy? Hell nah, it aint gonna happen. Look, I promise you that I will talk her into turning herself in before the shit gets real out there and look, this is what you're after, right? To protect your friend? Kate, Kate. Reports are coming in about a police pursuit, apparently it's our shooter. Choppers on it's way and I'm sending Tanya. And I want to know everything about that shooter yesterday. It's showtime, folks. In four, three, two. We have breaking news for you at this hour. Apparently there is a police pursuit. The LAPD is reporting minute by minute, only here, on the number one network. So tell me. I'm done talking. You help your friend by getting a car in her name and then she shoots a cop. So, if your phone records show that you had any contact with her this morning, you're gonna be named as an accomplice for aiding and abetting a fugative. We have contact, we have contact. I aint buying it. Nicole, we have it on tape. What more do you need to see to know that your friend is in serious trouble? Not just her, you, too. You don't need an attorney to know that you could lose everything. Please don't call her from my phone, please. Glad we're doing cash with the whole lost of trust and all. How soon could you get to the 405 North? Why? Want to make some real money for your baby girl? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice and that's just stupidity on my part. Let's just end this marriage amicably. I'm paying out of my own pocket. Here. And take this, it's a police tracker. Good luck, and call me when you see her. Y'all but what can we expect when our own president is cosigning on police brutality. Shit. Wait, wait, wait. Are you all checking out this video that Danny-j-L-A just shared on my page? Let's go check it. The police on beast mode at this black SUV. They got the choppers out and everything. Y'all see that shit? It's a chick, a chick shot that cop. Could we get any more stereotypical? That's right, Danny. No evidence, no eyewitnesses. Just a black woman being chased by cops and instantly she's a cop shooter. Shit, that's the problem I was spinning all about earlier. We are guilty until proven innocent. Y'all, do me a favor, mi gente, send me your tweets about this video Can't be the only one that thinks this is wack. It's an African American woman, milk it. More breaking news, we bring you a live pursuit of the alleged assailant involved in the shooting of Officer Joel Murphy. Now we go to live to Wide Eye Sky. All we can tell you and what we can see from this chopper is that the driver is an African American woman. She's definitely driving very very recklessly. About 90 miles per hour. This is a black SUV on the inside lane of the 405. This is definitely and accident waiting to happen which is why I believe the police have put some distance, Kate, between them and to try to keep other drivers on the road safe. It's also unclear whether or not she has a weapon. And once again, we advise our viewers to steer clear and let the police do their job. You tell your grandma about the concert you're gonna be in? Yeah. Oh, I'm so proud of you, my Bobby. Mom, this kids talented. He's much more talented than I ever will be. Yeah, you couldn't teach me what he knows. Oh really? He's better than like, I don't know, Bonnie James or Wynton Marsalis somebody like that. - He's that good? - Yeah, he's that good. You should come and see him, all right? - I will darling, I will. - Yeah, I'll get you tickets. Oh honey, I'm sure he has your father's talent. Let me tell you that I can still hear his music at night when I'm going to bed. He did play remarkably well... Tell your grandma we'll see her tonight. - See you tonight. - Oh, my Bobby. Mama. We gotta go. I'll see you tonight though, all right? I love you. See you soon. - All right. - Oh honey... This asshole on the bike. There is some on asshole on a motorcycle who's like all up my ass. Every time I look around this motherfucker is following me. He's a got a, a damn helmet camera. Standby, we're back in one. Kate, Hola Lola News tweeted her mugshot and its been retweeted over 100 thousand times. How the hell does someone working from a basement out pace a multimillionaire dollar network? You tell me. You know the power of social media nowadays. Yeah, sure do. So what do we know about her, Rolando? You know it looks like a very typical middle class single mother, with a very cute kid, that's for sure. It looks like this is something that could have happened to any of us. We're back in four, three, two. We continue live on this dangerous pursuit. So, what do we know about the felony suspect Lucretia D. Whitaker? We have contact, we have contact. Going somewhere, little girl? You aint getting away. Fucking 5-0 is deep in these streets. Where you at, you all right? Hi, Lucretia, my name is Officer Sarah Behrans. Yo, what the hell they doing to Nikki? Your friend is okay. Your friend told me that you're too smart to ever do anything to risk never seeing Bobby again. Was she right? I have a daughter. She's a year younger than Bobby, so I understand. Nikki told me that you're a really good mom. Yeah, well y'all can just let her go 'cause she didn't have shit to do with this. Well, we're still trying to figure that out. Look, I aint shoot no cop and I can prove it. I believe you. Yeah and why the fuck would you believe me? Because I know that sometimes men don't respect women's physical boundaries like they should. Oh so you know? You know that greasy fucking pig had his hands all over me. I want to see that proof, Lucretia. Can we make that happen, just you and me? Two mothers, two women. Look, if you can agree to this, I promise you, I promise that I can protect you from all those other cops that just want to get the cop shooter. Okay, all right, I'm down with that. But first you got to get 5-0 off my ass. Man, they gotta stop chasing me and then we can figure out where to meet up. Sarah, do you have the suspect locked a meeting place yet? Shit. We're gonna need time to set up... Fuck. You snake ass bitch. You was gonna set me up? No, you're gonna get yourself killed if you don't... Yeah, well I'll take my chances. Shit! Shit! All right, who can blame her for running? Dang. Just trying to catch up with all these Instagram memes but shit, this chick has got a record, too. Forget about it. Like I said earlier, guilty until proven innocent. Damn fake news. See, this is how this shit gets started. People jumping to conclusions before they got any hard evidence. I mean, they're calling her a cop killer and the cop aint even dead. Oh shit, viewers, all right. If this lead actually pays off we're about to get lit real quick. So stay tuned. - Slow. - Why'd you even pull me over? Don't get yourself killed. Nice and slow. Back up more! - Okay. - More! Okay. Down on your knees, down on your knees. Put your hands out.

Okay, well we're gonna get into that. What is happening to me? Okay, can I get you some water? Okay, or a chair, or maybe some space. Maybe you need some space right now. I need you to get the fucking camera out my face, just for a minute. Okay, okay. We look like high school news! We look like a number one news station not afraid to leave our comfortable recliners to give the viewers what they're turning to the Lolas of the world to get. Give me more, I need more. Well, you asked for it and now you have it. Live with it. I want you gone, Kate. Step back, keep them back. - Get back, get back. - Get back. Are you stupid? No, sir. Well you are now.

All we have are the tell me everyone's dirty, distorted misery filled secrets to help take attention away from our own. Who cares what happens to that woman? Nobody. Kate, get out, now! Rolando, you're on. We're back in four, three, two. Welcome back, folks. We continue with live coverage tonight of what happened earlier today in the valley. As you know, there's been a police pursuit that we've been following over the last couple hours. Oh my goodness, did you see that? Okay so real talk, we're here. We have her, hold on, one second. Let me give her the tour. Okay, so this is Lola G's headquarters, as you can see this is my office, that's my room over there. You have the virgencita in the back. You can get, you know, say hi to her, pray to her. Do all those things. Okay, let's sit you down right there. Perfect, we got to make sure we got this in a two shot, girl. All right, everybody, welcome to Hola Lola News. You know what to do. If you haven't already shared this, feel free to share this with your friends, your neighbors, your friend's neighbors. Okay, get this story out because here's what is up. I am sitting here with the shooting suspect, - Lucretia D. Whitaker. - I didn't shoot nobody. Okay, but that's actually why I said suspect. Stay with me, chica. This, this is why I love Hola Lola's News, it's real, raw unfiltered and it's what I've been bringing live to you guys for the last two years. I mean think about it. Stories like Lucretia is the reason that I broke out on my own. If we don't give voice to the voiceless, who else will? All right, mi gente, the police know where we are. So really technically it's only a matter of time before they come in or we go out. So let's get to it. Did you shoot the officer this morning? I just told you I didn't shoot nobody. Okay but aint nothing cute about a routine traffic stop that ends with a shot cop. And nothing cute about one that ends with a dead black man or a black woman but that shits happening every day in this country, expect nobody's asking why this shit keeps happening. All anybody wants to know is what did he do to deserve it or what did she do? Man, we aint got to do shit but be black. So, what are you some sort of vigilante? The fuck, Lola? Thought you was on my side. I'm on the side of the truth, that is the only side we take here at Hola Lola News which is why you guys follow. Make sure that you're following me at Hola Lola News across social media, if you're not already. 'Cause this, this is once in a lifetime. Well, do you want to know the truth? - I do, we do. - Why don't we watch my video, it shows what really went down. Oh, look at this. A Hola Lola exclusive. You heard the woman, let's skip the foreplay and get straight to the nasty. Plug you in. Play the tape. Can I help you? - Captain Green. - Yes? We want to give you this. What is it? The shooting behind our store, Officer Murphy. Yes, on here? Watch it, please. Hey, Manny, it's me. I got your text about stopping by the hospital and sit with Lucy and check on Joel, hey that means a lot to me. I uh, I told a perp today that I have a daughter. Can you imagine that, me a mother and you a father? I mean really though, can you imagine it, us as parents? Anyway, I just wanted to call and thank you for checking in on Joel and for basically being a fucking awesome husband and um, and that birthday present that you gave me this morning. You are the only person in this world who gets me and I don't know what I would ever do if, uh look, I just want to make sure that you know that I, I really really love the birthday gift. I'll talk to you soon, okay bye. Hey, what's the situation? They're streaming this from inside the house. Now I'm gonna need you to walk us through it? I do ride share for a living. So I know about obeying the traffic laws. I mean, it's not like I'm just doing whatever. Okay but, you were complete stop right here. Exactly, I came to a full stop but this fool says that I didn't. I think he just wanted to pull somebody over from the get go. He didn't have no reason to pull me over. He rolled up. Look, you can already just tell his demeanor. Look at this posture, this guy. Banging on the window all crazy, like he was running after. Wait, how do you pause it? Okay, oh hit the space bar. So this is the part right here where he asked me for my license and registration and when I reached over, he just started freaking the fuck out, it's like, he, I reached for the glove compartment, he reached for the gun. Keep your hands where I can see em and get out of the car. My hands, look, always visible, just like my moms told me. See, check that out, mi gente, that's what's up, though. Here's the thing though, we all know is that different angles of the same video tell different stories and right there, like, you definitely have your hands up. Stand over here. Turn around, put your hands behind your neck. Spread your goddamn legs. Shut up now and do it! Do it now! Man this, this shit is not for real. A body search man, for a stop sign? - Shut up now! - Get your hands off of me. Shut up, stop resisting. Keep your hands behind your neck. Do we have any indication of where they are in the house? Looks like a living room, maybe, could be a bedroom. Do you know if they're armed? Haven't seen anything. Okay wait, what's going on here? He's way too aggressive and that so called pat down. A body search man, for a stop sign? - Shut up now. - Get your hands off of me. Okay? - Am I under arrest? - Stop resisting. What the fuck? - Aint nobody resiting shit. - Keep your hands behind your neck and stop resisting. Okay, so I don't understand. If you had the video, why run? Did you see that motherfuckers hands all over me? - For a fucking stop sign? - Shut the fuck up! God damn it. - Man, you don't know me. - 11 Adam, requesting back up. - Shut up! - Somebody help me. I don't give a fuck about hurting you! You see this motherfucker? Hey you recording this shit? Jesus Christ. You know what, motherfucker. I got some shit for you. You trying to push me. Yeah, well. I can show all the fucking videos I want, don't make a difference right? Nobody gives a shit about the truth. Plus, I'm a survivor, okay. My survival instincts kicked in and I did what you or anyone like me would of done. I ran for my fucking life. Man you trying... Yeah, it's like, a cop gets shot. No, Lucretia. Not shot. A nurse just tweeted, rest in peace Officer Joel Murphy. That's his name. I think we just went from shot to killed. All right, mi gente, you know what to do. This is where you step in. If you have any evidence to prove this is real or better yet, that it's fake news. Please I'm urging you to send me a tweet... Thank you very much. This is going allover the internet. Look at you. - Oh Joel, stop it. - Party pooper. - I am officer... - Don't. Sarah, are you still there? We have set up a perimeter and we are going in to get this cop killer. Now that you've been upgraded to a cop killer what's your next move? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I just hope I'll see my kid. Okay, yeah. You know what, let's switch gears for a minute. Okay, you have a son. Mr. Chen from Sonny's Liquor just came forward with another recording of the shooting. From this angle, Sarah, it looks like the girls hands were nowhere near the gun. Bullshit, we saw it with our own eyes. And I'm telling you what I just saw with the same set of eyes and you want to know what else I saw? Joel arrest this black kid with what some may call excessive force. Same alley, same MO. Innocent people do not run. You want this shit getting out about Joel, huh? 'Cause that's exactly what will happen if you blow this up. She has her video and we have Joel's. Which is why we need to get all the cameras together, take our time, and see what really... Cap, I gotta go. Sarah, what I said earlier still stands. Alive! Do you copy? That boy is my heart. He's all. He's all I got. Lucretia. It's obvious how much your son means to you. You know, look, I aint got kids yet but I got three nieces and I would die and most definitely kill if anything or anyone did anything to hurt them. Which is why I'm confused, hermana, like you did time, which means that took you away from your son who you love so much. Come on, why you gotta bring that shit up? Yeah, I did time. Okay. I did 18 months. We continue with this breaking news and now we will take you live to Lola's News house. Apparently this is the YouTuber that is harboring Lucretia D. Whitaker, the suspect of shooting the police officer earlier in the day. Tanya Ayala is live at the scene. The images that you are about to see are dark. LAPD has asked all news media to turn off their lights and apparently all the lights have been turned off in the neighborhood. Viewer discretion is advised. Tanya Ayala reporting life. The police are ready to make entry into Lola Guerrero's residence. They asked us to turn off the lights. So let's see what happens. Turn it off. More people are coming over to support you. All right, Lucretia, this is it. Let me just tell you, the world is definitely listening so if you have something to say, now is the time to say it. Okay girl, what do you got? 'Cause you know the world is watching right now. I made some mistakes. Okay. Mistakes that cost me so much. Cost me time with my son and I lost the only man who ever really loved me. Who hasn't made mistakes? I get it but why should we believe you, all right? Like, this is it, Lucretia, come on. The world is listening. Now's your chance. Like they listened to Trayvon Martin? Or like they listened to Mike Brown? I could go on and on down the list. Tamara Rice, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, or Jordan Edwards? Or any number of the other people who's popping up every damn day? Man, I'm trying to figure out what the fuck is happening and what the fuck happened to us? Hmm, America? We're going in blind. We have to assume that they're armed. What else have we learned? According to the live stream they're both in the living room but knowing this doesn't give us an advantage because we have spectators streaming our every move. So they have eyes on us? Like we have on them. I say we throw in a smoke bomb, cut the power, draw them out. You said there's four million people watching this shit right now? Yes, girl. All right, well y'all tell me. We here in America where anything is fucking possible, except you got too much melanin in your skin. I promise that I can protect you from all those other cops that just want to get the cop shooter. This is the police. Open the door and come out.. Look, man. I'm sorry about what happened to that cop today. I am but he came at me for no fucking reason and he shot him own damn self and I say good for his ass and what I'm just another angry black woman? Step out of the house with your hands up! And when did shit get so fucked up? Man, this shit is a joke. We got more damn cameras recording every move we make but there still aint no chance for us to get justice? You are surrounded. Step out of the house with your hands up. And while I'm keeping it really real, keeping it 100 for the people, man folks running around here recording every damn thing the last thing they think about is justice. All people give a shit about is recording that next viral video. But fuck that real shit is actually going down in the video. Lola, they're coming to get you. This is your last warning. You have no way out. When is shit going to change, when? I'm saying how many blacks gotta die? How many cops? I'm tired. I'm fucking tired, I'm real tired. And I know I aint the only one, I can't be. You know what? We keep acting crazy and these kids. This is your last warning. Like my sweet baby boy. This younger generation running around here, man, they aint gonna make it. 'Cause they aint gonna know how to treat each other like human fucking beings. You guys have no right to break into her house without a warning. Do or die or me and mine motherfuckers running around here desensitized. It's like what I'm talking about here is not just about people of color making it or whites or even cops. Out now. Get out, get out here! I'm talking about every fucking body! If we keep doing this shit we are doing we are all going to die. Aw shit, well shit has really popped off now, America. That is lights out. Police, let me see your hands! Let me see your hands now! Hands where I can see them. You, come out from around that desk. - Let me see them. - Now. - Turn around. - Stand here in front of the bed. Put your hands behind your head and turn around now. You are under arrest for the murder of Officer Joel Murphy, you have the right to remain silent. - Anything you say... - Gun, gun! Hold your fire. It's not a gun, it's not. It's okay. Are you okay? Yeah, yes. I'm okay. And you make sure you turn that homework in today. You hear me, Bobby? Yeah, momma. Okay. Smile, you're on Candid Camera. I'm on there? Uh huh, yeah, Auntie Nicole got it for me for the Cray Crays I be driving around. You so silly. Go on, boy, get out of my car. Don't forget you got an after school today. Okay, don't be late. What's up, Bobby? - Hey. - Welcome, welcome. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye, sweetheart. - Bye. When is shit going to change? America. I'm real tired. And I know I aint the only one. I can't be. I'm real tired. I'm tired. I'm saying how many blacks gotta die? How many cops? I'm real tired. Huh, America? When did shit get so fucked up? We keep doing this shit that we are doing we all are gonna die. I'm real tired. And I know I aint the only one. I can't be. When is shit going to change? Huh, America?
