Look over there! - Come on! - Forward ! Master Balisten, the Romans! By Jove, what beautiful horses! You can buy all of them. - I've not yet been told the price. - It doesn't matter, friend. It's not as though you'd pay for them. It's a deal then. Go ahead, try and take them. Take him away. Master, what are you doing? Surround him! A strong man like you will make a magnificent slave. THE STRONGEST SLAVES IN THE WORLD I've never seen so much water in my life, Emilius. Then enjoy it, Marcus, because you'll soon miss... this spectacle as much as those in the arena. Those atrocities? I hate them. That's why I attracted the wrath of the emperor. - So what they say is true? - Yes, Emilius. Someone insinuated that I sympathize with the Christians. You of all people! You like women too much to be one of them. Yes, but sometimes just being under suspicion is enough. But in the end, Nero wasn't too severe with me. - What a magnificent country this is. - Wait before you say that. Forward! Come on. Get moving! Hurry up! Get to work! Move along! Hurry up! Come on! Guards! Flog that slave! Hurry, hurry! Come on, quick! You bastard! Damn them! What are you going to do? - This is not the time. - When, then? When? It will come, I'm sure. - Let's get back to work. - Get back to work, go on! You bastards, get back to work! Go on! - What did he do? - Nothing, he just wanted a drink. I'm... thirsty. Who doesn't thirst in this damn country? So go ahead and drink! Greetings, Selim. The heat is stifling today. There's never a moment of peace with those scoundrels. You seem to get by well enough. But how do you manage to get away with skimming off so much money? This is my share? It's much less than last time. That's for bringing this rotten grain. I'm eating what even pigs refuse. Very well, Gaius. But remember, if the money for the next load isn't evenly divided... this is the last deal we do together. So, what is it? Are you tired? Exhausted? Why should you be? You work very little and badly at that. You'll be punished! Starting tomorrow, you'll be on half rations of water! Hurry up, come on! Go! Get moving, you bastard! Go on, bastard, get to work! Centurion, we have visitors. Look! Let me guess, Lucius Emilius? You're the officer who'll relieve me? Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not. The tribune Marcus Aulus will be the new commander of this garrison. And you, Gaius, will be his right-hand man. You mean I'm staying here? And in a subordinate position besides? They sent me here... ...in the midst of this fuss to punish me, not you, Gaius. Is that right? This will be the tribune's first command. Your experience and advice will be invaluable. Very well, but... I can't be responsible for your decisions, tribune. I regret I can't offer hospitality worthy of you... but unfortunately we're not in Rome. I have something to show you, Emilius. When you return, you can inform the procurator. This is the plan of the aquaduct, and this is the section that we're building. This is a matter that concerns you, Marcus. Yes, of course that's true. More him than me now. So, we started here in Moiken two years ago, in October. Today we should be here, Gareb, here we are. But we surpassed Gareb three months ago. What do you think of that? I can get to the waterfalls... Oh, I'm sorry, you can get to the waterfalls six months earlier than planned, maybe even seven. You've done a good job, more than others could have. I had to overcome a thousand difficulties. There's no water here, you have to reach it on muleback... and the air is so hot... ...you breath fire. Remember what I said at the waterfalls? - A lot of slaves died? - Yes, of course, but who cares? And they don't rebel? Not with the methods I use on them. It's not advisable. Yes, prevention is better than cure. I'll see you soon, Marcus. When you get back to Rome, perhaps you'll have less aversion for the games in the circus. You wanted to see me? Have you ever tasted that stuff? It's disgusting. Even to them. I took a look at the accounts, Gaius. Given what we're paying for supplies, we should be eating better than we are. Now that you're in charge, save more money, if you can. - Anything else? - No, not at this time. - Give me more. - Get out of here! Thank you, Balisten, thank you. Go on! Move! Get to work! Get to work! Get moving, bastards! Gaius! How long has this man been here? Judging from the bowl of water, I'd say... - ...two days. - That's right, Centurion. He resisted less than the others, it was really disappointing. Take him away, soldier. - I told you... - Yes, of course! Obey your order. Listen to me, Gaius. - And don't forget what I say. - Don't think about it twice, I have a good memory. All the better for you! Here, only I have the right to condemn a man to death. - I and no one else, understand? - No! No! Go! Go! Get out of the way! You too! Get back to work! Get back! Get back! Let me live, tribune. Help me. No! He won't suffer now. - You didn't have to kill him! - I didn't realize. I'm sorry. - Get back to work! - Move, get going! Bastards! Back to work! Go on! Hurry up! Move it! Get going, you! What are you doing? Get back! Get back! Guard! Guard! He tried to drink? No, but that one did. I had just started whipping him, when this bastard pounced on me! Do you know what awaits you? Bury this man in a pit! No, centurion! No! I already told you I'm the only one... who can condemn a man to death. I didn't anticipate your order. The slave who attacks a soldier must die, you can't decide otherwise, tribune. Let the man go. Let him go! Do you want to get us all massacred? You must punish this man as he deserves! Or you'll encourage all of them to rebel! Right now, you're the only rebel. Then I'll see this to the end. Put down your weapon. You'll have to kill me first. I don't want to fight a fellow Roman. Fine words. Yes... ...that hide a coward. I'd wait to say that! Halt! Get back! Get back! Get back! Go ahead, kill me! No... I've just proved who's in charge here. Come on, quick! Back to work! You made a mistake not killing me. Your visit doesn't surprise me, Gaius. You're a good soldier, but this time you failed in your duty. You left your unit... without your superior's authorization. I had no other way to talk to you. I asked several times to confer with you, but I was never granted an audience. What did you want to tell me that's so serious? I feel it's my duty to inform you that the situation over there... grows more worrisome every day. Marcus Aulus has been weak with regard to the slaves. His approach is undermining the security of the garrison. This morning he ordered the slaves to be unshackled... during the night! What are you saying? That's not possible! That seems absurd to you, right? I objected to it! And now I'm risking a court-martial for insubordination. But the lives of my legionaries are more important to me. I know those barbarous slaves too well. They'd massacre us to the last man! Hopefully it's not too late. Tomorrow you'll arrive at your unit. If what he said is true, it's a very serious matter. You'll accompany him. I want a detailed report. - Yuro, wake up! - Leave me alone! - What's happening? - Look! What's going on? Wait! Wake up, Balisten! Look at your foot! Your chain's gone! It's not a dream! We're free! We're free! Wake up, everyone! We're free! Let's get out! Get out! Quick! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Too easy! Leave him to me! This way! They jumped on us in our sleep. The sentinel wasn't able to sound the alarm. - Were any others saved? - No. I don't think so. - And the tribune? - I don't know what happened to him. Emilius! Have you heard? A massacre. It's frightening, Terencius. You were supposed to countermand Marcus' order. Give him advice and prevent these mistakes. I tried... Silence! The slaves must not get away! Had you been there, with your greater wisdom... He wouldn't listen, that can be confirmed. Rome will not let this massacre go unpunished. - Where were the rebels headed? - Toward the coast. No doubt of it. We'll cut them off before they reach the plain of Emmareth. A thousand crosses will mark the end of their flight. I checked the chains. They were intact. The slaves didn't break them. Unfortunately, Marcus Aulus' responsibility is clear. It'll be better for him if he died. Claudia couldn't have chosen a worse time to come here. - When does she arrive? - Today. The lookouts have already sighted her ship. - Do you want me to tell her? - I'd rather speak to her myself... even though it won't be an easy task. In all her letters, my daughter spoke to me of Marcus, and insisted on coming here so much I had to agree. But it will be a terrible shock to her. Courage, Aderabat! Come on! Get up! Leave him alone! He has the right to die. - You've chosen a bad place. - You brought us here. What of the others... The others will already be dead before we reach the sea! The Romans won't miss the appointment! You know everything! Predict everything! But if we hadn't crossed this desert we wouldn't be dying of thirst. You didn't foresee that! Hey! Over there! Look! A wild horse! We're saved! There must be water around here! Water! Water! - Water! Water! - Water! Water! Water! Water! Wait! - Water! - Water! - Water! - Water! Wait! Water! Someone's there. - What should we do? - Let's hide! - Where? - Underwater! - Balisten! - Kusa, how are you? - Hey, it's Balisten, come! - Balisten? - It's Balisten himself. - Hooray! Where have you been? How are you? - There's a rabbit! - Part of it's for me! Finally something to put in our mouths! - Hey there. - For me! For me! We looked that night... and tried to find you. Someone said they saw you in the tribune's cabin. - That's possible. - Balisten! Kusa! Why did you save him? Answer me! - Because I owe him my life. - But I don't, damned Roman! Stop, Kusa! He's wounded! So what? His kind killed us like dogs! He didn't, he never did that. Get out of the way! - He's my friend! - Too bad for you! Hey! What bad manners! Kusa! They're arguing. Hey, go splash over there. There, good. Well! That one missed the mark. Do you want to join in or not? We're eating! Let's see how it ends. - Yes, let's go. - Come on. - Come on! - Come on! What's wrong with you, Balisten? Listen to me! Anyone who touches a hair on the Roman's head will have to deal with me! Understood? - The Roman? - What Roman? - Greetings. - Greetings to you, Gaius. Wine! Give it to me. I congratulate you, Gaius. I know you're trying to find other slaves for the aqueduct. - How many men do you need? - 4,000. A good deal. Not so bad. But do it quickly, there's a storm brewing. The people won't tolerate you... or the other Romans here a day longer... Don't be foolish. There's a legion here. It would be a breeze for us to crush a revolt. I thought you were more clever than that. It's easy to get rich when there's a bit of turmoil, at least for those of us who know how. I'm sorry. I can't. It's too risky. It's not for me. Think it over. You may change your mind. It's wonderful! Gorgeous! In Rome, I never imagined what beautiful things could be found here. I'm glad you like it. Oh, father! What news do you bring me this morning? A message from Marco? Still nothing? But how's that possible? I've been here for two days now. Father, I'm very anxious to see him. - Listen to me, Claudia, I... - Oh, why that serious look? Do I have to blare trumpets, procurator? Let me tell you something. I understand the feelings that bind you to Marcus, but... But he deserves my love. So generous, so loyal... But don't be jealous, I love you too. And I'm deeply grateful you let me come here. Thank you, father, a hundred times! No, a million times thank you! Sorry, I'm talking too much. You had something to tell me. I'll say no more now. You must forgive me, I'm so happy... but to whom can I say these things, if not to you? You're my only friend. Do you remember what we swore when I was six years old? We'd tell each other everything, no matter what it was. I've kept that covenant with you. What's wrong? Hm? What is it? What, you're not pleased with my happiness? Tell me... So you really do have something to tell me. Tell me, please. No. No, father, I'll try to guess. Marcus... Marcus is sick? It's very bad? - He's hurt? - Claudia... - It's not possible! - My child... No, it can't be true! Marcus is alive. He's alive. He's alive. I know it. I know it. He's alive! We have to take a risk, my friends. Or else spend the rest of our lives in this hole. I'd rather die. For 600 miles, all ports are overseen by the Romans. We might as well choose the nearest one. I agree with Kusa. Aristea is the capital, but also the most important port. It's also the busiest. That will make it easier to go unnoticed. Up to a certain point. There will be even more Romans there than Aristeans. Few or many, we have one of them amongst us. Kusa! Never mind him, Marcus. You could go and leave me here to die. - We don't know where to go. - Oh, I know very well. Every night I hear you repeating the same thing. Soon you'll be speaking to Ephraim. I know your speeches by heart. In Aristea, Kusa's fabulously wealthy friend Ephraim... will give you the money you need to embark. Is that not so? There's one thing, though, you don't know. You tell him, Balisten! You're coming with us to Aristea. We won't be going alone. But we must be sure that when you're there you press charges against Gaius with the procurator. You have my word. The word of a Roman. Whatever that's worth! There's one more thing: you have to remain with us. Agreed. And hope that Ephraim will find an embarkation for us soon. We'll find him. He'll pay whatever amount they ask of him, I assure you. Ephraim was enriched with my blood, when we fought in the arena. He has a lot of money and a magnificent palace. Come here, Ephraim, answer me! How did you fall into this reduced condition? Speak! Say something! And to think that we were counting on you. But I'm ready, more than ready, to give you free help, believe me. What? You need us more than we need you. Well, first of all I'll find a safe place for you to take refuge. - But not here, master! - Goliath is right. That's obvious. You wouldn't be safe here. - Though he's only one Roman... - He knows that you're here... ...and our heads... Don't worry, you'll see that I have a lot of friends... - Are you a slave? - No. - Are you Roman? - Yes. Run, Goliath! My assistants aren't very brave. But this is a miserable neighborhood, full of wretches... willing to spy for a piece of bread. Do you think he's a good prospect? We're trapped. - But I... - Why don't you speak? What should I say? I've already given you my word as a Roman. In any event, I'll stay with you... until your ship leaves. - That will take time. - It doesn't matter. If that's the case, we prefer that you... return to your people. We already have a lot of trouble. We can't look after you too. Goodbye, Balisten. The Gods know I'm indebted to you. Thank you. My debt was the greater one. The life of a slave is not worth that of a free man. Do you really believe that? There are many who don't feel that way. And I agree with them. Marcus! I'm the tribune Marcus Aulus. - I want to speak with the procurator. - Pass! - The tribune Marcus Aulus. - He's been rescued. Come on. Marcus! Marcus, you're alive. Claudia! My love. Love... I dreaded the thought of never embracing you again. You've got to go now, Marcus, or you'll be arrested. What are you saying? You don't know? There are serious charges against you. But there's no time to explain further. Go Marcus, I'm begging you. Tribune! The procurator is waiting for you. Stay calm, I've nothing to fear. We saw him with our own eyes, Gaius. - Are you sure? - Of course. He went to the procurator. We'll be exposed. I told you so! Shut up, you idiot! His return hasn't changed anything. You put your unorthodox ideas into practice. But it's absurd to consider slaves as free men. - I never ordered... - Absurd and dangerous! A lot of legionaries died because of you! I repeat that I never gave that order! Then who ordered that the slaves be unchained during the night? - The tribune Marcus Aulus. - Why? He called on us to provide... more benevolent treatment for the slaves. That's not true! And how can you believe a deserter? Go ahead, speak up! I'm sorry, tribune. I was present when you gave that order. - And you? - Gaius spoke the truth. It's not the truth! And I can prove it! You don't have witnesses. You're the only survivors. By order of the procurator, I went to the place. I didn't find a single piece of evidence in your favor. I never gave that order. Even you believe I'm guilty? That's for a military court to decide. I'll prove my innocence! I hope you do. Marcus... Take him away! Alarm! The prisoner has escaped! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Stop that man! Stop him! Stop him! - Out of the way! - Out of the way! Go! Stop him! Stop that man! Stop him, I say! What bad manners! There are other kinds too. There's a beautiful green if you're interested... What's the matter? - Greetings to you, sir. - Greetings. What can I do for you? I have to provide a sumptuous banquet for some friends who've come from Gaul. - Do you have chickens? - Of course, and beautiful ones, too. Look. Yes, but maybe Gauls don't eat chickens. - Yeah, that's true. - Perhaps ducks would be better. Here they are, take a look at them. - They look a little skinny. - By no means are they skinny! Look at the thighs. Look at that chest. It seems a little underweight. All feathers and no substance. Don't say that, sir. They'll look impressive to your guests. - Believe me. - You think so? Do you want some eggs or apples? No thanks, I'm done. Show me some of your cheese. If you need sausage, I have some of excellent quality. Later, perhaps. Show me your cheese. Here it is! And it's the best cheese in Aristea. From the countryside, the genuine article. In my opinion, this cheese... - What's wrong? It stinks. Hey you! Hold it. - Mamma! - Where are you going? Don't arrest me, please! I'll give back everything! Goliath! - How are you? - Not bad. But don't interrupt me when I'm working. It's dangerous, I have a heart condition. Where are the others, Goliath? Efraim's house is closed. I can't find anyone. They're hiding, and it's up to me to get them supplies. Yes, but where are they? I need to see them right away. - Come, I'll take you to them. - All right. Let's go. Take that, Tronco! - Are you serious? - Shut up and defend yourself. This was Ephraim's idea. - To kill each other? - No. We'll fight against other gladiators in the arena. That's the deal. They'll have their faces covered with a wolf's head helmet. No one will ever recognize them. I'll call them the "Wolf's Head Gladiators". And in a year's time we'll have enough money to board a ship. A year? I have to get something for myself, right? Ouch! Even so, your future is less gloomy than mine. But Marcus, how could they... blame you for the slave revolt? - I was accused by Gaius. - Gaius? - That wretch is still alive? - Yes, in Aristea. That's why I remain here. Unfortunately we can't testify in your favor. I'd kill Gaius even if it meant ending up on a cross. That would serve no purpose. But there is something you can do for me. Any carelessness and you're done for. I'll be more cautious. OK, let's go! Ah, staying vigilant, eh? - No, I ... You know ... - I know you need to keep watch! - If I catch you doing this again... - Oh, I'm scared... With all my courage... I tried to convince myself this was going to end well. But it was useless, I spent many awful days thinking of it, Marcus. Then, finally, I saw you. All too briefly. I have faith in you, Marcus, but you should have fled. It would have been easier. No, Claudia. But how do you prove your innocence now? You have to stay hidden. You have no opportunity to act on your behalf. Don't you think I know that? In any case, I have friends that can help me now. I'm very frightened, Marcus. Don't be afraid. I'll talk to my father and see if I can convince him. No, Claudia. If he knew we were meeting, we wouldn't be able to see each other again. Stay calm, I'll be fine... and everything will return to normal. The gladiators of the noble Fusar's arena... will fight against the men of Ephraim! The Wolf's Head Gladiators! Cheers for the Wolf's Heads! - Who is this Ephraim? - A poor scoundrel. A man of a thousand trades. But it appears his gladiators are very skillful. The gladiators of the noble Fusar! Cheers for Fusar's gladiators! Omnipotent Gods, take pity on a poor old man. Let them be victorious! They're clean. Death! Death! - Death! - Death! Death! Death! - Death! - Death! - Death! - Death! Death! - To the death! - Death! - Death! - Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Kill him. You have to kill him. Kill him! Kill him! What are you waiting for? Kill me! Cheers for the wolf men! You saw it too. You saw how we were urged to kill. They've not yet had enough cruelty. Why didn't you kill Gaius? His time will come. And he'll pay for the death of that gladiator. - Sit down, tonight I'm buying. - How generous! I assure you that... No, no, it was here. Innkeeper, more wine! How can that be? At one point, I was facing nine of them... - and all armed with spears. - What did you do then? Maybe you won't believe it, but... as soon as the first one was run through, I grabbed the spear, and before he could ... Ah! Who? What do you want? There's a woman. What are you doing? Do you want to see her? Tonight! Right away! You don't like my mistress? - Your mistress? - Yes! And who is your mistress? Don't you remember that beautiful brunette in the arena yesterday? Sitting next to me? Ah, that one. I didn't think she was very friendly. Yesterday her husband was there, but today she's alone. - Alone? - Alone, alone, alone, alone! Really? She's waiting for her brave warrior! - And you're coming with me? - Of course. Where's your mistress? Goliath! She's coming now, don't be in such a rush. - Ah. - Eh ! - Tronco! - Who's calling me? - What's the delay? - I don't know. Mamma... Mamma mia, this is going to be bad. Ouch! - Who are you? - This is my smaller brother. He's afraid to be home alone. - What a strange family. - Everyone says that. What are you doing? If you're going to be unpleasant, I'm leaving. Of course you'll leave! Hold firm, Tronco! Smile! - I can't. - Try! Now I'll kill you both! - Do you remember me? - No. - You don't remember me? - No! Go tell Gaius his days are numbered. But how can a slave acccuse you? Don't you know there's a death sentence on them? Listen, if you want to show a lot of courage here, you should nail them to a cross with your own hands! - Is that enough for you? - Let me go back to Rome, Gaius. Find a way for me to go there. I want to get out of here! Stay calm! I'll see what I can do for you. - Which one of you saw him first? - I did, when I left my house. And there he was. He was a good soldier. He always fought with courage and gave ten years of hard service. And look how he ended up! Stabbed, like the others! Marcus Aulus hasn't become a murderer. His desire for revenge has blinded him. And he's probably decided to get me next. I'm the only witness left alive. I'll give him something to chew on. Procurator, if you assign me the task of tracking him down, I'll take him dead or alive! That's what your aim is: to kill him! - Kill him with impunity. - Claudia! That's why everything you and your accomplices... have said isn't true! - Claudia! - I know why you hate Marcus. He knew you were embezzling money. And I would have felt that way too! How do you know this? Who told you that? Is it necessary to ask? She's in love with Marcus and believes everything he says! You've seen Marcus? Where is he? Answer me! No one can ever stop me from loving him. Or from seeing him! Let's go back to the palace. - Do you see anyone? - No, I don't see anyone! There's nobody to the extreme horizon! He says he doesn't see anyone all the way to the horizon! If there's no one coming, let's go! He said that we can go! All right! Mamma mia! - Tronco fell from the trunk! - Funny! Don't tease me, brother... or else one of these days I'll knock you down! The whole city is under surveillance. Only a few men have a good chance of success. For that reason, we thought of you. It's not as simple as you think. The people here are exasperated, they can't wait. At the first sign, we rebel. The Romans will be slaughtered, they can't escape. You and your friends will be free and rich. Rich! Because we'll give you a great deal of money. More money than you've seen in your entire lives. We risk our lives every day. These men are asking us to risk it only once. And I agree! If the Romans are driven from here, slavery is over for us. And we'll be well compensated. However, it won't be an easy task, otherwise they wouldn't be asking us to do it. I'm with you. If death should come, better it happen quickly. And we all have an open account with Rome. Not all! - Forget about Marcus. - I thought of Marcus. But I won't hesitate between friendship and freedom. He wouldn't tell anyone. He would understand everything, he's always with us. Marcus has never betrayed us. But this time, it's not a question of his betraying us, but betraying Rome. When did you come in? - Just now. - We weren't expecting you so soon. The Wolf's Head Gladiators! They have no more rivals. It'll be more fun today if they fight against each other. They're the same! Just like me and Tronco! - Leave him to me. - What's the matter, Kusa? Out of the way! I don't want to kill by treachery, Marco. Defend yourself. - What are you saying? - Defend yourself! What are those two doing? Why do you want to kill me? What do you have against me? Go on, say something! Go away, Marcus! Balisten... Get out! Far from us! Yes... Go away. I have no other means to communicate the seriousness of what is about about to happen in the city The lives of those like Claudia are in danger. But perhaps you don't believe me like you didn't believe my innocence Guard! Call the centurion Gaius. A rude awakening, Marcus. I'm still a tribune. Get off me! Don't worry, I can't wait to stand before the judges, centurion Gaius. I've gathered enough evidence to prove my innocence. - What evidence? - Nothing I'm telling you! - Come on. - I give the orders here! Return to the garrison! Life is strange, centurion. You've just come to arrest the man who will condemn you. And force you to realize the thefts and murders... you committed to try and hide the truth. This is a confession of one of your accomplices, the one you killed last. The procurator will read this with great interest. Don't sing your victory song too soon, Marcus! You won't leave here alive! You won't tell anyone what you know. You can't do that. How would you explain my death to the procurator? I'll tell him you tried to get away and I stopped you! Tell him now, Gaius! Guard! Selim, I need help. You have to hide me! - You've been found out, hm? - Yes. And they're chasing you? No, they lost track of me. Look: hide me, save me, and I'll always be on your side. You're too compromised. What can I do with someone like you? - Selim, you must help me. - I've already given you my answer. - Get out of here! - Wait, Selim. He can stay. I have a proposition for you. All right, I've decided: you'll be part of the conspiracy. We're counting on your contribution, Gaius. This is the plan: find some way to commit the legion elsewhere. In the city, the Romans will have only 200 men left, and on our side we'll have the Wolf's Head gladiators. We'll stay here tonight and you, Gaius, will take command. Along with them, you'll enter into the procurator's palace. No one knows it better than you. Post sentinels and a guard duty. I don't know who those seven gladiators are, but I've seen them fight in the arena... and together we should be more than enough. I'll hunt down the procurator and his protectors... even if they hide underground... and finish him off once and for all. Our other friends will be here soon. To avoid any risks, leave the weapons in the Temple's basement... Why deny it? You're participating in the revolt. That's the reason you sent me away. You've already betrayed us! No, and I have no intention of doing so. Betray the Romans? - No, Balisten. - Why are you here, then? To warn you the rebellion will fail! I owe you a debt of gratitude, I can't forget that. - And I want to save you! - I don't believe you. Nor you? If I'd reported you, the Romans would've already come here, no? Maybe they're waiting for a more appropriate time. More opportune than this? I'm offering you a final chance at salvation... and freedom! I give you my word. If you don't succeed, do what do you want with me. Welcome. Our brave Wolf's Head gladiators have arrived. Ah... Now, finally, I can put them to the test... against soldiers worthy of them: the soldiers of Rome. Here he is, your leader! Leave him to me! Excuse me! Hold it! Those who pass through here will get kicks and punches in quantity! There's a lot of struggling going on here for the middle of the night.
