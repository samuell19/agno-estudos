It's a novel about a girl modelled after you You haven't forgotten, right? You're not Zhinan I just knew it You're not Zhinan, you're Zhihua At the reunion I could tell right away But not one of them could tell That was amusing Seeing how hard you were pretending I didn't want to reveal the truth Thank you Where's Zhinan? Back in your hometown? She's dead When? 7th, last month I was at the reunion to tell everyone the news but I just couldn't find the right time to say it So... Dead? What happened? She was sick What was it? Depression Did she commit suicide? We told everyone she died from illness Why keep it a secret? Why? I don't know why either We were schoolmates at university, too She didn't tell me that We were together at university That's when I wrote the novel about us "Zhinan" I even won an award as a best newcomer I tried to write another novel ever since but have found myself stuck in the past with memories of her I only realised today I only wrote one novel I wanted to write more novels about her Hoping she'll see them I was thinking once I achieve this I'll stop writing another novel We weren't close once she was at university She suddenly ran off and got married Zhang Chao? She married Zhang Chao? You know him? We met in university I always thought he was an older student But he wasn't even a student I still don't know who he really is He took Zhinan away from me He never told us about himself No one in the family know who he is He loves drinking and is violent when drunk He's a bastard You know my sister won't tell us things like that One day Mumu came to our place That's her daughter Her face swollen, eye purpled Crying for us to help her mom When I got there, my sister was beaten up so badly Zhang Chao welcomed me in like nothing has happened said he's going to buy some tea and left I haven't seen him since Never came back? Vanished My sister's life was ruined by that man She tried committing suicide many times The last time was on a mountain side Maybe if she married you things would have turn out differently You need to be home for the new year? You must visit me again Promise I don't want to leave What's wrong? I want to stay here with you What about school? I can change school I can be in the same school as you What made you think of this? It just came to me, OK? I'd be happy if you can But are you just worry about me? Maybe I am Don't be like this, it feels so heavy You don't need to change school for this I'll be happy if you come and visit every weekend Saran, what's wrong? I just don't want to go back What's wrong? Let's go MOM, HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD. PLEASE LET GRANDMA GET WELL SOON. CHENCHEN ZHANG CHAO Does Zhang Chao live here? I'm a friend of his He does live here, right? Yes How long has he lived here? I don't know He's always been here I only moved here a year ago He's at work, let me contact him for you OK He's replied Asking who you are - What's your name? - I'm Yin Chuan Y-I-N C-H-U-A-N I nearly spelled it wrong Why don't you come in, it's cold outside It's alright, come in, it's cold So what do you do? Me? I'm sort of a writer You wouldn't have heard of me You wrote this book, right? Yes I haven't read it yet Is he alright to get along? Scary when he loses his temper He's asking you to go out for a drink I'm heading home Drink with me I'm going. Don't let him drink too much He gets angry when drunk OK Long time no see It's been a long time Life is treating you well? Sit Give us two beers I know you didn't come to see me You want to see her When the door open and it was a woman you don't know, were you surprised? Zhinan is dead Haven't you heard? When? Last month Suicide You weren't a student at the university Who are you? Who am I? You drink, I'm leaving Stay You came all this way, sit for a while Are you alright? I'm fine, had a little too much, slipped off the chair I'm fine Don't make trouble Come on, sit down Sit back down You think her death is my fault? Isn't it? Then yeah, it's my fault I killed Zhinan But it doesn't have anything to do with you You're not important in her life I've read your novel What is "the two of them vanished before my eyes"? It's true we vanished from your life But whether it's me or Zhinan we had our own lives Do you think if you were with her, she'd lived happily ever after? You're just another failed writer To me, you're not even a writer You should really be thanking us Thanking me Allowed you to have a valuable experience An idea to write You know I'm right I never thought about being a novelist but wanted to be known Maybe a singer or actor or something But my family had nothing I didn't have any choice I didn't get into high school I like the idea of an university life so I found a job at the university's canteen When you're in classes, I'm cutting vegetables I've notice Zhinan She's the most beautiful girl to eat at the canteen I got closed to her To steal her from you people I wasn't targeting you You were just unlucky She was such a boring girl not even a woman, she looked so helpless all the time all I want is to beat her Then we had two kids who looked like her, especially the eyes Whenever she looked at me with those eyes I feel like I'm a low life A scumbag I ran I wandered for a while Came back a month later They were gone The place was empty So when you asked, who am I? I don't know I'm nothing I'm not a good husband I'm not a good father I don't really work And blames everything on everyone else How did I become this? So... can this go into your novel? A sequel but this time you have no business in it My experience is interesting, right? The cheque is on you Life... Is not really something you can... write on a whim Can I use a little of your time? What is it? I need your help do you have time? What is it? It's the graduation speech I don't know how to write it Can you take a look? Work on it together? I think you've got everything But it doesn't feel right Why did you ask for my help? Because... you're a good writer I'm not You're very good No one ever said that about me Didn't you... write those letters? Take a look I think it's about the same It's much better Really? How? I can't explain it but it just feels better You can definitely be a novelist Let's welcome on stage, from class 3-3, Yuan Zhinan for the graduation speech Teachers and fellow students Today, it's the day of our graduation I think for all of us in middle school this will be a memorable time with irreplaceable memories If you ask me, what are my hopes and dreams I don't know how to describe them But I think this is a good thing That just shows our future has limitless possibilities Our lives are full of wonderful choices Everyone of us here in the past, present or future have lead our own unique lives Dreams will come true for some might not for others Be careful Let's go When are grandma and grandpa coming home? I think later What's wrong? You two are? Yin Chuan? You're Yin Chuan? I'm Yuan Zhinan's daughter, Mumu You're the one who wrote those letters? I didn't think we'd see him here I'm Yuan Zhihua's daughter Zhou Saran That explains it You two look so much like them You look like Zhinan You and Zhihua I didn't think I would see you two here Us neither So alike Look so alike I replied to your letters as my mom I'm sorry I'm sorry So it's been you two The truth is... Zhihua's already told me about your mother My mom? Do you have time? Do you want to come to our house... and pay respect to my mom? Dongdong Dongdong Mom Why isn't Dongdong is his cage? Dongdong is not in his cage? Ask Chenchen Chenchen? I don't think he's home either I thought he's been weird for the past few days What was weird? How do you call yourself his aunt? Don't panic I'll give him a call What is this? What is he up to? Chenchen, Yuan Chenchen! Chenchen! Our grandparents are out They'll be back later Come in, please My mom committed suicide I know Zhihua told me We didn't tell anyone my mom committed suicide Just said she was sick She was sick all the time so people believed it Grandma thinks suicide leaves a bad impression But hiding the truth makes it like mom has done something wrong I don't like that I don't think mom did anything wrong I'm sorry I'm piling this on you It's alright Grandma only have old photos of mom. Can I be alone with your mom for a moment? Yes. Stupid ZHINAN I wrote this book You've written a book? What's it called? Zhinan This has you mom's name on it I've read it The writer is Yin Chuan So when I saw the letter I thought that'd be the writer of the book right away I see Can you autograph it for me? Yes Is the girl in the book my mom? I only read the book, after I read these Do you remember these? They're the same as the novel, not a coincidence, right? You've read them all? My mom treasured them Back then whenever I finished one chapter, I'll send them to your mom I finished this novel for her I so wanted her to read it Did she read them? Read them all the time I've read them a few times I can feel the love you have for my mom Only if you're my dad Even though time was bad I used to tell myself One day the man who wrote the novel with my mom's name will come and take us away I had hope when I thought about that Even though, you only just came but I think wherever my mom is she'll be happy Who is it? Don't know Hello It's here, over here Come here Officer Chenchen Hello, I'm his uncle He was wandering on his own at the train station He tried to sneak in with the other passengers So we stopped him We asked him where is he going?

It's mom's last letter Take a look What does it say? It must be something she wanted to tell us Read it out, I want to listen Today, it is the day of our graduation I think for all of us in middle school this will be a memorable time with irreplaceable memories If you ask me, what are my hopes and dreams I don't know how to describe them But I think that is a good thing That just shows our future has limitless possibilities Our lives are full of wonderful choices Everyone of us here in the past, present or future have lead our own unique lives Dreams will come true for some might not for others There will be time in life that is difficult and painful At time like those I believe we'll remember this place The place where our dreams were still limitless The place where we are equals, prestigious and shine What do you think? It's really good Anything we need to change? Nothing It's fine Subtitle ripped by CAPA - Avistaz 2019 -
