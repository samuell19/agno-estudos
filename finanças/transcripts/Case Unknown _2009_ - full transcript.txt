present a Feliks Falk film CASE UNKNOWN Starring Co-starring Come, come! Come faster! Get in faster! - Got nothing else to do? - Documentation. Help them! Faster! Faster! Let's get in!! Written by In Cooperation with Producer Directed by You know that guy? Yes, Mr. Płocki from my ward. Seriously disturbed... An eternal patient, you know. Won't leave the hospital... - I've never seen him. - Because you're new here. Tomorrow at 5 pm. Remember! Good. Bye, girls. Take care. - Were you listening? - A bit... to the finale. And? Don't ask. I don't hear a thing. God! You could say something. You could've gotten carried away at the end. So you hear something, then. OK, I'll work on it. - When are you leaving? - In a week. We must talk how arrange everything. I mean for Julia. Better with my mom than yours, yes? The kid with her now would be therapeutic... And yours is so absorbed with that boy... He's younger? Forget it. Mine could manage perfectly with her and Tadeusz. Whereas yours should get over the mourning first... She hardly knows if she's alive. With mine. Tadeusz. - Aren't you? - To the hospital. - Again? - Night duty. Didn't I tell you? I guess not. Come in for a spell. Say hello to Mom. All... right. Good you're here. How was it? OK. Her tummy ached a little. After chamomile tea everything's all right. Yes? - Hi. - Hi. Dropped in for a sec. I must to the hospital. Everything's fine? Yeah. We had some little problems, but they're over. Your mom called. She'll be in the cemetery on Tuesday. Of course, I'll be there. Can't you help her out? She's hardly left the cemetery for three months. She must grapple with it herself I guess. Tadeusz. Bye. I'll just walk Mom and outta here. Bye. So much of it after the flood, see? Yeah. Good evening. I've brought a patient. Where are you taking me? What have you taken me for, huh? Please calm down. A fucking conspiracy against me? Please cool it. All will be well. - Fuck off! - This is too bad. - Phenactyl, nurse. - How much? Two ampules and one relanium. What are you fucking going to do, huh? The SOB won't spit in my face. Violation of my civil rights! I'll write to a paper! Please help me handle a patient. Thank you. I'll get you! As always in such a plight. You're admitted to hospital. Haloperidol for the new one; 3 times 10 milligrams. An interesting case. Take a closer look at him. He may inspire you in your search... Aren't you looking for a subject of your dissertation? Yes... certainly. I wonder if the dose isn't too big at the start. Should we put him under observation first? So you're a follower of Prof. Dębicki, young man. Believe you me we have not bad results here too. - Doctor! - I'm having a round... I'm sorry. We have a problem with that Płocki. What's up? This is his incomplete file, lacking many details. Only the medicine prescribed and an incomplete case history in the last 5 years. He may be with us for 5 years? I don't know... One of the oldest files. - Are there many incomplete? - No, only this one. His documents may be in other files? My friends haven't found any. We've just finished work and there's nothing left. Bravo! Get the paychecks now! Once I'm finished here, I'll come and sign your bills. - And the file? - I'll look thru it. And think it over. May he live to see a hundred... Once again, once again... Stop it, please. Drive carefully. - What? - Nothing. My men have found a ghost in the hospital. A ghost? No number of ID or any kind of ID. In his case history we write Unknown. Non Notus. He looks in an odd way... Funny, but he has something about Father in him. - He may be a ghost really? - No kidding. Ghosts live with us. I believe it. Look at me! Julia asleep? She is, but has problems with her tummy again. She threw up again. May be just indigestion. Ask a doctor tomorrow just in case... - It's funny... - What? We got a doctor home, but I get treatment somewhere else. If your soul is troubled, Come to me. I'll heal you gratis. I've come now. Should I undress, doc?... Mr. Płocki? Mr. Paweł Płocki? I told you... Let's go. - So he doesn't speak? - Sometimes with monosyllables. With neologisms which are hard to comprehend. He's mostly mute. Peaceful rather. No signs of aggression. To me, he's burned out... Just a perfect void... Why do you need it? His is a strange case... I asked the interns who put the papers in order after the flood to find his file. - And? - And we have it, but it's almost empty. The basic data are missing. Don't you remember anything more? I started work here a year before you. Who's been here for long that I could talk to? You'd have to rummage through papers. Or ask the ward head. He should know something... Exactly. I'll talk to him. One more thing? Could I talk to Płocki? Well? He's a banal case to me. If you insist... ? He has me intrigued... Thanks. Bye. Well, doctor, Have you advertised it? - What? - That unknown case? I can do it for you. - My pal works for this popular paper. - Yes? We should write something and a snapshot. Someone can recognize him. - Where do I get his snapshot? - We can take it. He must look differently now... Who knows...? I can snap him... I always carry a camera. Where have you been? Hello. Coming. You finished? Yes. The meeting's over already. I'll be waiting in the hallway. - Where will I find you? - Downstairs. Best in the reception room. lwona and I became interns due to the action in the archives. I'll be looking for you. Bye. Good bye. He could've been still alive. That summons makes no sense. Why? We owe it to him. If someone made a blunder in the hospital, he should be punished. I told you to pay... Now it's pointless. It would've been of no avail. It's this way everywhere And my hospital is no different. Every time I see someone sick, he contracts another disease, and finally dies. Now I've got an unknown case. I don't understand. A guy no one knows anything about. - Nobody takes care of him. - Does it matter...? No, it doesn't. First name basis: I'm Konstanty and you Paweł, yes? I didn't say it'd be easy and you'd tell me all at once. Yet give a sign that you hear me, or look at me. Since you won't tell about yourself, I'll tell you about myself. Konstanty Grot, 29, psychiatrist, I've already worked in 2 hospitals, but they downsized, so, young, I had to go. This is the 3rd, but after the flood we ended up here. So we're in the same boat in a sense. What else...? Wife Renata and a beautiful 5-year-old girl. My wife plays the viola, tours a lot, but is doing well... a kind of female jazz. I've started my doctor's dissertation, but I wonder if I've chosen the right one... You've glanced at me! I saw it! You won't deny it! Will you glance again, huh? It may be a coincidence or not. We'll be working on it, friend. There you are, come, come... I have a surprise for you. We'll snap you. Agreed? Someone may recognize you. Cool it. Don't be afraid. Cool it. Don't be afraid. It's just a snapshot. Cool it... An odd case, atypical. Should be explained. I honestly hoped you'd help me, sir. I have the feeling Płocki has been in the hospital... for 10 years at least. If not more... Who could've worked then? I don't remember. People come and go. - Over 10 years ago, you say? - I think so. Maybe Ambroziak...? The one active in the flood? He often shows up on TV... Yes, he's become popular... Once he was an administrative director of your hospital. Even for a couple of years. Next he backed out for different posts in the town council and whatever. Now after that success, his appetite has grown... I know him. I may get you in touch if you like. He may remember something. May I call him at once? Good. Excuse me. My name's Konstanty Grot. I'm looking for Mr. Ambroziak. There. Load it on the boats. Take it away from here. Put it on the other side. Hello. You make a decision. Hello. Konstanty Grot. I know. I'm sorry we can only talk today after what happened to us... You see... I'm sorry to bother you, But I thought you'd help me with a strange case... Strange? Yes? Years ago you worked in a psychiatric hospital in Szymanów. At the end of the 70's... An episode I don't even include in my CV. After the flood we're putting our archive in order... Don't stand there but go...! ... and one file is lacking documents. Well... Paweł Płocki. Rings any bells? It must've been in your time. How do you know? I don't know. You were the only person who worked there that I know of. What name did you say? - Płocki. - Płocki? Paweł Płocki. I can't possibly remember all the patients of those years. - Płocki... - Yes. No, I don't remember. But our papers were always in the apple pie order. Something may've gotten lost during the evacuation. I thought so too. It was tied with a knot. See? May I? There're no other documents. Someone may remember. A doctor maybe? - What doctor? - The one admitted him. But who? If we don't know when, how can we associate him with a doctor? I don't know. You'll have trouble... But I can't leave it at that. What're you going to do? Go on looking. I thought you could show me somebody who worked then... - My dear friend how... - Sir... Coming. We don't even know the time we're talking about. My contacts with those circles broke off a dozen years ago. There was social work next. And you see the hassle now... Thank you very much, anyway. Thanks. If something springs to mind, - I'll get in touch. Dr...? - Konstanty Grot. Gimme. You shouldn't have taken the trouble. The expertise isn't ready yet. I told you to be patient. We have few facts and this is a long trial... It's been going on for over a month. It may take even twice as long. The experts are tied down with lots of cases and this one isn't simple. I wonder if I could file a complaint, - which could speed it up. - Hot-tempered, are you? A complaint would slow down the procedures. Best wait patiently. See what I've brought you? I've stolen these from my daughter without her knowledge. First we check your memory. You recognize it? A small Fiat, remember? You know what a car is? It doesn't move you? See it drive. Well, catch! You must help me. If it breaks, Julia will kill me. And this? A locomotive. Remember? You recognize it. Been a railroader? Or someone in the family?... What're you saying? Nobody has tried to talk to you for 2 years... But you'll have to with me. Focus on success. If you talk this way, a string will break at a concert. Bye, darling. Don't let daddy forget you. Call him from Granny and remind him there're other things besides work. Things? Will you bring me other things? Good. After 5 days. Bye. Call me and say how it went... You can't be reached by phone, anyway... I'll record on the machine. - Hello. - Hello. Where's the patient who'd lie here? Transferred to another hospital, I think. As many others. We're overcrowded after the flood. - Is Dr. Julski in? - No, gone already. Excuse me, where has the patient Paweł Płocki been transferred from the psychotic ward? Stenia, you know where Paweł Płocki been transferred... From the psychotic ward... Płocki... To social care on Nasturcjowa St. Social care? Who has ordered such a nonsense? Hello. Excuse me. Has Paweł Płocki been brought here from the hospital in Opatowice? The sluggish one who doesn't speak? Must be him. Could I see him? Downstairs. Room 7. What's your business? I'm his doctor from the hospital who treats him. Aha. And you want to see him? Yes, if I may. Of course, you may. Go ahead, doctor. Thank you. So I've found you. God, what a mess this is! How could they...? Don't be nervous. I'll take care of you. Come. Make a good impression and I'll take care of the rest. - Where are you taking him? - To my hospital. You can't. He's been brought just today. Janek! - It was a mistake. - You have permission? Tomorrow. I told you I'm a doctor. No way. You'll take him tomorrow. Janek! What's the matter? He's taking a patient without permission. - You heard it? You can't! - I'll do everything tomorrow! Jesus Christ! See? This is where I live. Where should I... wait... Maybe here... Wait, excuse me... Yes?... Oh, no, no... I've completely forgotten. I have problems with a patient. Sorry. Can you collect Julia from the day care? I simply can't manage... So they'll wait. Mom, take a taxi. I'll refund it later. I'm really sorry. I'll collect her tomorrow. Thank you. Come... Come, come... This will be your room. We'll put it in order now. Don't you worry. Sit down, sit down... here. They won't arrest me for this, huh? Would you like to tell me something? Gimme your hand... The other one... Good. I wonder if bath helps therapy, but you'll be clean at least. I've taken a bath today. All right. Thank you. Try holding the spoon this way... See? This way it doesn't spill. You sure can do it. Good... Try again. You'll sure do it. Hello. Now the neighbor's wondering where I've taken such a man. Family or a stranger? Normal or sick? But don't worry. We both know you're all right and won't make any problems. The only one is I still don't know anything about you. In the long run it's tiring. Let's turn the tables: You take care of me, treat me, give me much of your time, but know nothing about me. You'd go crazy. Admit it: Is this all right? Come... What? You can proceed unconventionally, but there's a limit. You'll be keeping him home all the time? It's against the rules. I couldn't let him rot in social care. My apartment is a much more appropriate place. There may've been a mistake. I don't know why. But it doesn't change your situation. There were problems with you before: The family that charged you with aggressive behavior... They wanted to deprive a sane mother of her rights. So I had to react. With Płocki, it's another story. I want to keep him under observation. At my own expense. I'll take a leave of absence. I haven't used a month and a half of time-off due to me. I want to talk to him and began to activate his movements. - You're in over your head. - Yes. What if you fail? No guarantee at all. There have been cases of recovery. There's this Ciompi therapy in Italy. So the say, but not of a patient with such a defect. You're a dreamer. Sir, I want to be sure we've done everything possible. He has nobody. If I don't help him, then... I can't be held accountable for this. He's not in my hospital. You're accountable now. Better learn of the legal consequences. So long. Welcome... Gentlemen, no smoking here. Thanks for the care. What are these pictures? I was in India 2 years ago. - As a tourist? - No, I was looking for God. - Did you find Him? - No, but I found peace, which I needed badly. I should go there too. Look at these shorts. Not bad, huh? They'll fit. Take a look. That journalist called. A woman said the photo reminds her of someone. You serious? Her phone number. You think it's her? I'll ask. Look, Paweł. It may be family. - Well? - No response. - And she? - Must be a red herring. - How old can Paweł be? - 40 - 45? Not 55 for sure. It's not your wife, Paweł, huh? I get it. Here. One hand, the other, and now forward. Go back. You must've mistaken painting with dusting. But not bad all in all... - Hi. - Hi. When did you return? A moment ago. I've collected Julia from Mom... Look, Dad, what Mom has bought me. Hi, darling. - Excuse me, but... - This is Paweł... Remember? Without any documents. He's living here. We've been cleaning a bit... Living here?! He's from the hospital? For a short time... I'll explain later, OK? Come. A crazy idea! What's come over you? - Who'll take care of him? - Me. But I'm living here! And the child! Don't worry. Everything's under control. - Why, he's ill. - No, only dull. He's peaceful. No problems with him in the hospital. He didn't have an interesting company. The therapy calls for a company of normal people. - Not to make him afraid. - But I am. No way. Wait, let's talk quietly. This is my trade. Get it? I may manage to return him to life... At least a little... You forget about me. I'm not going to stay home with a cuckoo. I'll stay with him. Just a couple of weeks. I want to see if the therapy makes any sense... - Come, Julia. - Darling... We surprised them a bit... Come. Come on in. I'll be back right away. Listen... It was so sudden. They transferred him to an awful social care. You can't imagine the conditions there... They offer no treatment. He'd have vegetated there till death, whereas I'd started to work with him... - He's really peaceful? - Yes. He's just lost contact with his surroundings. They didn't notice any symptoms of aggression... All right. I'll take him away if you want. - How long would he stay? - A week or two... All right. Let's try... But... Cool it. Would I have brought a madman home? You think I'm that irresponsible? Sometimes... You didn't contact Julia. I'm sorry... How was it over there? Haven't I left the Rorschach test here? I don't know, doctor. What does the test look like? No matter. I must've left it in the staff room. May I see the record of admissions? Here. No note about the patient who spat on me. You forgot? I'd asked you. Impossible... I remember putting it down. Something about that memory... - You have quite a mess here! - But, doctor, I really... Wait. We started a new record three weeks ago. It may be there. Is this it? It is. Sorry. I'm queasy about it. Thank you. Sorry. - Doctor! - Yes? I'm about this ad... I examined the photo... How did you know me? This nurse showed me you leaving. Could we talk? Sorry. I'm in a big hurry. Could you leave your number? I'll call you. You sure you have something interesting to tell me? It seems... He reminds me of a friend from a club. We practiced karate. Karate? Sounds good. I'll call you. Thanks. Thank you. Excuse me... Can you come for a sec? Excuse me... Why did you lock him up? We made a deal... Don't you see I'm not alone? It was only 2 hours. He can't be locked up. In this therapy, he must feel free. Don't you know this is my problem? There's nothing to fear. He's been with us 2 weeks. Has anything happened? Can we talk about it later? I have a rehearsal here, as they're refurbishing the center. - Excuse me. Have we met? - No. My name's Ludmiła. I'm working here. I'm sorry, but we have no birth certificate with that name. Are you sure? I went through all the names beginning with 'P'. Unfortunately, nothing. All right. Thank you very much. Bye. Well, citizen? Not a trace of you. Not in the computer. And the earlier ones? You've been registering for 5-10 years. There was a fire in '88 and most papers burned. - We didn't have computers then. - What do you do, then, when someone comes for certificates or whatever? Nothing. An industrial accident then. And we issue new ones, based on the ID. So you manage somehow. Thank you. Again nonexistent. Come. I don't know what to do. Not a trace left of him. Is this possible for a man to disappear just like that? I'd prefer that he disappeared from here. You promised. I'm looking for a place you know. Something happened? Look, Julia, you've spilled it. Eat clean. Dębicki's secretary called. Drop by around noon. To the Conference Center, though. Who's that? I'll go and look. - Good evening... - Good evening. I was just walking my dog and thought... My wife told me... to ask if someone lives with you... not all there. You know what I mean? No. I'll make no bones about it. A mental lives with you... From a psychiatric hospital. You could say so. I'm a doctor in care of him. - We heard he's dangerous. - Really? Who said so? They say... We have kids. The other neighbors would rather he weren't so close. You know what I mean? I do, but I don't like the proposition. The man will live here as long as I want. Clear?! Get away from here, or else even the dog won't help. You better keep him locked up. Come, Miki. I've told him an earful, huh? Who needs a Nosy Parker? Briefly: I don't approve of what you're doing! Doing?! This environmental therapy of yours... Kidnapping the patient, bringing him home, etc. - So you know? - Is this a secret? No, it wasn't kidnapping. The hospital sent him to social care and I wanted to clear the air... I know another version. Why involving yourself in it? Waste of time. There's a definite method of therapy in such cases. Experiments are not always successful. I thought... I was quite sure, that is... No matter what you think. Facts count in science. And facts confirm there was no complete recovery in such cases. Not with this method, anyway. Your scholarship was for research in psychopathology, not experiments on the side. I saw you among serious scientists, not someone striving after effect. If you insist on continuing this barely motivated experiment, I'll have to cancel my support. - Sir! - Coming... But I haven't yet... Think it over and calculate what will profit you better. Is he playing cards? That's stretching it a bit. But he catches on. Look. I put queen of clubs. Double ruff! A higher card... Well! All right. But he did it twice with an ace. - By accident? - God knows. It didn't look it. I say he catches on. All right. - Thank you for keeping him. - You're welcome. - Good bye. - Good bye. Play with him and you'll see. Good idea. Hasn't crossed my mind yet. Good bye. Apparently no association, but you play cards. Huh? Smartass. This is Solidarity Square, former Red. You know what the Solidarity is, huh? What were you doing in Aug. '80? And later? Already in hospital? You must have it written somewhere. You can't be a blank spot. They're looking for something. Ever ridden a motorboat? Maybe you've been a sailor? Or a fisherman?... Life guard? What were you, dammit? Tell me! Sorry... Sorry. I didn't mean it. That Dębicki unnerved me. He doesn't believe in what we're doing. But you reacted... Someone shouted at you? Wronged you? Well? OK. Quiet now. I wonder what happened... Move back, please. I said, don't approach. He has a wedding ring. Take it off and secure it. Wait! Wait! A corpse... God, you're talking? It was a corpse... They've just pulled him out... He was drowned... No... no... I... want... No... I can't... No matter. It's important you've started talking. The corpse... is dead. I told you, got drowned. We can't do anything. No... No... I... I... I don't remember... OK... Quiet... Quiet...There. Come we'll drive home. We'll have long talks. Come... Nothing in those years. Let's check the 70's. Not all here yet. Only the final years... Excellent. Let's see 77-79, for example. Here you are. Oh... Boreń... Ludwik Boreń... He was everywhere then, but not in the following years. He could not have worked in the hospital already. That's what it seems. He vanished. I'll be back in 2 minutes. Don't open the door. I'll set the alarm. Don't open. We say, I won't open. Don't open... Oh, stop teasing me... Ask Mom over on Saturday, or... I must hang up. I have a visitor. I'll call you back later. Hello. Dr. Grot, I remember. Well, how goes it with the patient? Have you found his papers? Any progress? It has to take a while. That what I said: Psychiatry is no appendix. Done and over with. It takes patience. I watched it for years. Another request, sir. I'm still looking for traces of Płocki. Didn't I tell you I wasn't there then? - When? - When he was admitted. How do you know when he was admitted? I don't get it. You didn't tell me you hadn't been there then. How do you know when he was admitted? You mean to say that I lie? Oh, God, no. You could've made a mistake. I checked that Płocki was admitted Feb. 25, 1978. Well... Ludwik Boreń admitted patients then. Working in the hospital then, you must've known Dr. Boreń. Boreń, of course. Now we can talk. There was one Boreń but for a short time. What happened to him? - He left. - Where? Everyone goes where the pay is better. A pity... He could say more about Płocki's disease. Twenty years on... I don't think so. Sometimes one can remember something years later. All right. Thank you. - Good bye. - Good bye. I told you not to get out. He put this... I wanted... I didn't think of such therapy... But who knows. Come. - Hello. - Hello. Konstanty... What's the matter? Julia! Let her go! Help! - Off we go! - Help! Come. They hit you. We got a Band-Aid? We have to take care of him. I'm calling the police. - Who's that? - Must be your Mom. She said she'd come tonight. Police? You didn't remember the number. I was fleeing home when they drove off. It was a golden Vectra. But the number is important. No witness has remembered? I don't know. The other car left too. So we can't help you. Gentlemen, it's an assault. We step in when we have witnesses, traces, registration number, a description of the perp, whatever. I've described one... If you see something suspicious, get in touch immediately. Isn't your patient... dangerous? No, don't worry. He's not mental. He lost his memory, which I help him recover. All right. I'm asking just in case. I'll walk you to the gate. - Gone? - Yes. - Will they do something? - Nothing. They must have witnesses. See? It's all the same everywhere. - Julia asleep. - Yes, she is. This may be repeated. Aren't there enough weirdos? Remember the one with the dog? You should send him to hospital. Now that he started to unblock? Didn't you see how he behaved? He thought about the kid, not of himself... Wanted to defend her. I can't send him back now. A month wasted because of such... It's a defeat. Would that it weren't for us all... She's right... Send him back. They sent Father too... - Should I call you a taxi? - No need. I'll take a bus. Don't mix Father with this... There's nothing in common... You told me to fight to the end. You did. Forget it. You won't resurrect Father. I won't, but the world will be better-ordered at least. What's his point? - Only he knows. - These talks are pointless... - Why aren't you sleeping, Julia? - I don't want to sleep. - Let her go! - Cool it. He hasn't done anything to her... - He mustn't touch her. Got that?! - You frightened her yourself. You didn't want to do anything to Julia, yes? No... I didn't... See? My dolly! See? This is your gentle patient. A dangerous cuckoo. I don't want him here tomorrow. - Understand? - Calm down! There, there. Quiet... See? They're driving us out... - No longer than a few days... - Till Friday, OK? Come, the doctor will take you to your room. This is a good hospital. No danger whatsoever... I'll drop in tomorrow, OK? - Bring him to Room 4. - OK. Thanks. Come... come. Take me away... I can't... I don't want... Come, we're going back home. I'll talk to Renata. What's that? Renata! Renata! What happened? Where's my wife? She's gone with the kid to her parents. - What happened? - She said she'd stay there. Someone threw a rock at the window with a piece of paper attached. Take the cuckoo to the cuckoo's nest. This is Konstanty. Is Renata there? Put her... I've just arrived... I don't know what... Good. I don't know what happened... But... He's not here now... All right. I'll call... I wonder... It's overcrowded... A week or two. I'll come up with something. This is a chance for you too. You can learn a lot. We're researching an interesting case. There is progress. Just a week or two. I'll come up with something. And my internship? I must show up in the hospital. I'll get you a leave of absence. - You're in the black book yourself. - My wife's mostly. I had no other way out. Well? - All right... - Excellent. Thank you. You'll stay with Robert for some time. Don't worry. You know each other. I know Robert. I like Robert. He likes you. See? He's never said he likes someone. We're making progress. You must talk to him a lot to make him open. Good. We'll talk. Don't be afraid. I'll come to you every day. Good? - Oh, come on. No way. - For food expenses. Tadeusz! Need help?! No need. It'll be ready right away. Incredible, huh? I didn't suspect I'd have so much fun ever. You've peace at least. You'd use some too. I was attached to Krzysiek all my life. I thought it my duty... The kids are important, but marriage... Here today, gone tomorrow. Who cares? Enjoy life while you're healthy. You should give it some thought. Especially now when the air isn't so clear... It's much more complicated, Mom. But you can't live there now. Do something about it. Ecco Spaghetti Bolonese Hello... Nothing bad can happen now. Whoever asks would think that Paweł's in hospital again. But he isn't? No, I won't be intimidated, but have to see it through. He's with Robert. I'll have a glazier put in window panes. - All will be as it used to be. - And you'll bring him again. - No, I'll leave him with care. - Didn't you say it's no use? It certainly isn't. But there are foundations. I'll check it. I must rehearse home a lot. A tour in France next month. If he shows up again, we'll leave no matter what. Remember. All will be well. Stop it! You'll kill us, crazy! Boreń Ludwik Robert? Hi, this is Konstanty. I'm off to Łódź tomorrow. I've found a trace... Yes. Back in the afternoon And I'll tell you all. So long. You should've let me know before. I have a seminar now and fly to Geneva afternoon. I can't refuse Prof. Dębicki's Ph.D. candidate. - Can you call next week? - I've just one question. Only one? Shoot. Did you admit to the psychiatric hospital in Szymanów in '78 the patient Paweł Płocki? I thought it'd be of a scientific nature. Why do you need it? Not for your dissertation? No. After the flood, there's a big mess in the documentation. Some patients don't even have their case histories. I'm looking for someone who worked there then. If he could help me. Can I remember the documentation over 20 years ago? It's absurd. Sorry. My students are waiting. I'm famous for being on time. Good day. That caretaker must've been right. You're feigning it, huh? Seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? Remember the Chief? Aren't you pretending you're him? No. What? I haven't seen the Chief... Am I right? Good. You haven't seen the movie, that is. I'll find a DVD and play it for you. He's getting better. This is important. I've been to court... And? Most records of '78 are missing. They've cleaned the archive. Impossible! How do you know? My aunt's been working there forever. She's found files with descriptions of patients the court sent to hospital. - Anything about him? - No. His name's not in the list. There are two numbers missing in the register, though. Aha. - One more thing... - What? The list of expert psychiatrists then features the name of Boreń. - Kidding? - No. Really. Could we xerox the list? Done already. Great! Off to a quick and brilliant career, are you? Here! It's clearly said! A strange coincidence, right? A pistol... In cords... kind lady, in cords. - Excuse me... - Yes? A second in private, please. Excuse me... - Haven't I seen you before? - Yes. A week ago. I asked you about a patient you admitted to a psychiatric hospital in '78. It's you again. Only one question... What a coincidence: an expert psychiatrist in a Wrocław court and a doctor in the hospital where suspected mental patients were brought? We have little to tell each other. Good day. Come. The guy seems unwilling to talk to us. You wait! Don't talk... Yes? Who's that? The patient I mentioned. All right, but... only for a moment. Let's go there. It's empty at this time. Sit down. - Does he respond? - He does. How did you learn about the court and the case? From those who recognized you. I found documents too. - You got them on you? - No. I have his here. I secured the others. Why have you come here? To learn more about him. You destroyed all the documents. Only you could do it. - You're mistaken. Not I. - Who, then? As it happened, a family man then, I got romantically involved with a nurse and a baby was born. Unwilling to part with my wife, I hid it. Once, Ambroziak, administrative director of the hospital... gave me an offer I couldn't refuse. A D.A. had a brother... - His name? - I don't remember. - Płocki maybe? - No... Ambroziak invented the name, especially for him. For some reason the D.A. decided to commit his brother. I was a court expert then. Ambroziak made me write a false diagnosis and sent him to the hospital where I was working. He wasn't a quiet type, notorious for aggressive behavior, prone to brawling. So the court, basing on my diagnosis, decided to institutionalize him. I preferred not to ask questions, having gotten lost in all that. In the hospital, still restless, he called names, and beat up a male nurse. He was pronounced dangerous and treatment began. - What drugs? - Cheap downers. He calmed down. After a time was withdrawn, isolated, and lost contact with others. Didn't you want to release him later? Three months later, I left the hospital, moved to another town, broke up with my wife, and lived with the woman who'd born me a child. None of my business. Where are the documents? Why not in his file? I don't know... Ambroziak could've taken care of that? Maybe... I don't understand one thing. What? How could you live, aware of a sane man rotting in the hospital where you'd put him? Wasn't that a bother? It was. So what of it? I feel repugnant even now. But I had no choice: to try to help someone who couldn't be helped and to waste my life, or to fight for survival to be able to do good for others later. - That's what you did? - I think so. The topic is exhausted, I think. One more thing... Why did the D. A. do it? I don't know really... Now I remember: Mąka... - What? - The D.A.'s name. Mąka. Rings any bells? Mąka? Mąka... Maybe... - Did you recognize him? - I don't know... Such a... Were you so aggressive, or did he make it up? I don't remember... Will it always be this way? No. Come. We'll see in the car if the recording is good. Come. Active rest. Garden, flowers... A lucky guy you are. You can say that again. Turn this off. My passion. The flood's over. I deserve a rest. But I can't hide from you even in my own house. - Are you stalking me or what? - Can you listen: Where are the documents? Why not in his file? Ambroziak could've taken care of that... I want no disco here. - You know him? - Who's the guy? Boreń. You also knew the D.A. Mąka? I did. So what of it? Many know him. they all have something in common with your patient? You want to implicate a D.A. in it, you're welcome. Good luck. - I'll find him! - Alice... The guy worked in Wrocław, which poses no problem. I need to find the SOB. Hey, quiet... All right. That brings to mind something? He drew back. This happens. He could've taken part in the protests in the 80's. He could even been active in the underground. May have been beaten. Why did he react so to the drowned man? He could've seen a dead man. Maybe... Why did his own brother put him away? He could really have been ill. Boreń spoke of his aggression he was notorious for. Wait. A guy told me who claimed he had a pal in his karate club, who vanished suddenly. - Paweł karate?... - I know... I've seen that girl. She worked with us, putting the archive in order. She's an intern in the hospital. A year below me. Not bad... By the way... May I ask you a favor? Could you stay with Paweł in the afternoon the day after next? - I have a date... - Sure thing. So long. Thanks. Nothing special here. His questionnaires of the 80's. - And his address? - Here. He doesn't have to live there, though. I'm sorry I get you involved with this, but... Good. I'll write it down for you. Who's there? Hello. My name's Konstanty Grot. I'd like a word with you. One moment. - What's your business? - Is your name Mąka? - It is... What's this about? - I'd like to talk about your brother. - I don't have a brother. - You sure? Good day, mister. Good day! Be seeing you! I'll apply for a detective license. Does it remind you? He may not recognize him after all those years. - You sure it was him? - Absolutely. I may give it up, huh? So much hassle to no avail... - You kidding... - I'm serious. I've had it. I'm a doctor, not an investigator. I won't apply for that license. Hello?... Hello, sir... Yes... What do we do?... I'll think about it... and call you tomorrow. Good bye. The expertise about my father turned up no results. I'll forgo the trial. It could've been my fault. Did I overlook something? I saw him... with you. One of those who assaulted us in front of the house... Maybe his driver? Driver... Why do you pester me? I saw you on TV in good company. Paweł recognized him too. What do you want? Wait a minute! Yes? Yes, it was him... Today? But why there? Why not somewhere else? All right. In half an hour... Ambroziak... Ambroziak. I'll drive you to Robert. He's with the girl now. Maybe Renata will get over it? - My wife's not home? - No, she's left with the daughter. She'll be back soon. Good. I must go somewhere and he'll stay here for half an hour. In my study. Come. Sit here and wait for me. I can't take you along. You can browse thru this. It's about brain. Don't leave. Renata may be pissed when she's back. If my wife is back, tell her he's here for a moment only. - May I get in? - Yes. This poor town won't survive another flood. So about the weather? So you know already. - What? - Paweł is my brother. He is of Mąka, the D.A. Only the name tallies, not the photo. It was snapped 20 years ago. The disease has done the rest. Boreń said he's Mąka's brother. That's what I blackmailed him with, not to disturb me. - How do I know it's true? - I'm telling you this... Leave this. - Because? - I want to have peace. You sent a thug... who... If he's your brother, you had him put away for 20 years. You're talking of peace?! You understand shit! You put away your own brother?! Should I have killed him?! What do you mean? Get in... Take a look... my brother... 11 years my junior... a nice boy... shy. Here with our father... Mother... They both died in an accident. when he was 13. I took care of him. Here with me during my studies... still a kid... Not so nice later... Instead of school he was into karate... He liked when they were afraid of him. - So this is true, anyway? - What? Nothing... He won a championship in the army, but they kicked him out because of vodka. Next this... This is a police photo, which I found on him. You recognize him?... No? You're too young to remember... Zaruba... printed illicit papers, organized protests at the end of the 70's. Not many of them then, like him. He'd meet foreign journalists, so he pissed the authorities. They jailed him once, twice, but it didn't help. I don't get it. He'd disperse secret meetings, broke car windows, beat up college students. At last... this... What happened? What happened?! He fled here, on our plot, where I found him with my first wife When he wouldn't answer calls for three days. He was lying here in his vomit and howled that he'd killed a man. They sent him to a demonstration to threaten Zaruba, but he killed him. My brother! I was afraid they'd hide him till he was needed and next would off him... I told Boreń to write a referral to put him away for a time. They took him away when he was dead drunk. And you left him there for 20 years?! What was I to do? Let him kill people? What would you have done? He's my brother! I covered up till I could. I couldn't stand it. My life was on the rocks. I left and when I returned, he was a vegetable. I loved him, but... Will he recognize me? Will he recover? Renata? I'm sorry... I left him... Don't be afraid. I'm coming. Lock him up! Get it? I'll be with you right away.
