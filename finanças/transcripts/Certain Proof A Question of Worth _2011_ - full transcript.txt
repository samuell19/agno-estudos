Hi, I'm Chris Cooper. What if you couldn't speak or use your hands. How would you communicate? How would you prove that you could learn, that you have an opinion, or that you matter? My son Jesse faced those challenges every day of his life. Jesse was born in October 1987 ten weeks premature. My wife Marianne and I were still in shock when, on his third day of life, he suffered a massive brain hemorrhage. Jesse would spend the next 17 years with severe cerebral palsy until his passing in 2005. Jesse was a gifted writer and poet with a keen intelligence and a wonderful sense of humor. First impressions can be deceiving, and Marianne and I struggled to get the world to see him beyond his disabilities. The film you are about to watch follows the lives of three children, Josh, Colin, and Kay... all very much like Jesse. The barriers they face in obtaining a meaningful education are the same challenges that more than 750,000 children with cerebral palsy face in this country each year. To believe in every child and to believe they all can learn will move us beyond the disability... To see children with extraordinary potential and beautiful possibilities. Thank you.

We went in just for a well-baby visit and ended up leaving with an appointment for an MRI. ♪ It was a couple days before we heard anything out, and it was, you know, cerebral palsy. ♪ (woman ♪2) Colin has cerebral palsy because, during his delivery, he didn't get enough oxygen. So he suffered a hypoxic injury to his brain. It affects most of his body. ♪ [cello enters] (woman ♪3) When Kay was first diagnosed, she was like three months old, and once they said the words cerebral palsy, it was almost like one of those cartoons on TV where the adults are going "Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah-wah-wah" because I don't remember anything. I think the biggest fear is the unknown. When you have children, you have expectations, and you have dreams for them, and then when you have a child with cerebral palsy, it's like someone's pulled the rug out from underneath you. You don't know what to expect, and a lot of people look to you for these answers, and you really don't have them. (woman ♪1) I question almost daily if I'm crazy or not, thinking that he's, you know, a smart kid. It's hard when the people around us don't think he's in there. The world assumes he can't learn. That's the danger. Why not first assume that he understands everything? It's the least we can do. ♪ [machine beeping] Ehhhh! (woman) Did you sleep good? Ehh, uhh, ehhh. Heh, heh! [laughing] Heh, heh!

Sit back. [voice-over] It wears on you after a while because you start to wonder, "Well, are they right, and I'm wrong?" Hehhh, huh, heh, huh, heh! (man) Comfortable? You OK? His wrists are a little tight. I'm just gonna turn this hand over. Good; I think with his hand, the fact that they're a little stiff... Same thing as the range of motion. The stretching we did down here, I would do up here too, and I can get occupational therapy to show you how to do some of those things. [voice-over] A lot of times, we underestimate the amount of time that it takes to help somebody find their voice. I think for Josh, we've got a long way to go to really find out who he is. They've really gone through a lot just to try to find out how best to help Josh communicate, and they really haven't found that right answer yet. Myself as a provider, I have to think there's always hope. We just need to do a better job and find the right answer to unlock that child's potential. [off-camera] All right, let's see... wait! Should we smell? Huh, heh, heh! Are these stinky shoes? Oh, my goodness... whew! All right, it's the last time I'm gonna do that. The true test of our society now... We have the science to save children's lives. The question is, do we have the humanity and the resources that are gonna make those lives meaningful? [echoing acoustic guitar leads gentle composition] ♪ (Dawn) Get those toys. Get 'em! [voice-over] When we found out Josh wasn't gonna speak, it was a hard blow. Say, "Hi, Auntie Lisa!" Oops! [voice-over] You know, it's... He can't physically hug me, and I was hoping I could hear, "I love you, Mom." Everyone wants to hear their kid say that. You know, you're mourning the loss of what you thought you had and trying to figure out what you're gonna have, but you want your child to have a happy and normal life. [off-camera] Josh. Josh.

(woman ♪2, voice-over) There's just a fundamental lack of understanding about a child like Colin. (woman on bus) He's turning that big 1-0 today. Double digits! (woman ♪2, voice-over) You can't assume that because his body doesn't do what his mind wants it to do that his mind doesn't know. I like your balloon. (woman ♪2, voice-over) He's in a third-grade level classroom, but when they assess him on the grade standards as written by the state for third grade, he doesn't make the grade-level standards. They feel that he is on a first-grade level. I believe he knows more than first-grade level, but he has to prove that he knows it. That just doesn't happen to kids without disabilities.

He's using those muscles all day, and Colin gets real tired real fast. (teacher) Yes, OK. Excellent. I want you to put a couple more words on there. (Kat, voice-over) I think he's very smart. You know, he's very observant; he notices everything. He's always asking questions with his eyes and facial expressions. He knows what he wants to say, but he can't find a way to always say it. [peaceful guitar composition] (Deby) His world's very different from yours or mine. He can't get up and walk across a room. He can't speak. He can't count on his fingers. He can't do little tricks and things that kids come up with to remember things... Drawing and taking notes about things. He can't do that. All of his has to be by memory in his head. Colin is a smart kid, but when they pull him away from his third-grade friends, they're telling him he's not good enough to keep up. He's not good enough to be there. The truth is, they don't really know how to include him in the class. (woman) If you're not finished with your math packet, I'd like you to work... (teacher, voice-over) At this point, Colin is performing on a beginning to mid first-grade level in all academic areas. His motor control changes from day to day, moment to moment. His stamina changes. It does have an effect on Colin's ability to, um, output what we need from him academically. (Kat, off-camera) Look at the question real quick; look right here. (Deby, voice-over) He is continually doubted on what he knows. They would have him do the same thing over and over and over again. Colin gets tired of it; he gets bored, and he's not motivated to do it. Sometimes they're stuck in the minutia of everything being exactly so. Colin's output is always going to be different, and I don't think that that means that he isn't getting it. Even though it's not in the same format that another child would do, to expect that they can do it the same way is very unrealistic. [soulful piano melody] (Yvonne, voice-over) We want him to fit into society like any other child would. I mean, I feel like we're doing a good job meeting his needs given... Given the situation. I think, where Colin is reflects both his disabilities and his cognitive ability. [calm piano melody] (Deby, voice-over) There's so much in his head that he can't physically do.

How am I gonna meet her needs with 119 other people? Big parts of me went, "I have no clue what's goin' on. "What am I gonna do; how am I gonna do this?" We knew she was gonna have an aide. I was sort of trying to think in a thousand different directions how this was going to work. (Kay, voice-over) (Pat) I didn't know how she was gonna do science. That was my biggest thing.

(Erickson) We know that children learn better from other children. We've got research that says, the more talking that children are doing, the better outcomes we have. Once children get labeled, we're putting them on a track that makes it nearly impossible for them to be awarded a standard high school diploma. (device) Cam is a girl. Pat is a boy. (Yvonne) All right, let's check your memory. (Erickson, voice-over) They rarely have access to other students who are talking and trying to problem solve and trying to figure things out. They'll be more likely to learn if they're in a classroom of peers who find learning easier than they do than if they're in a classroom full of peers who all struggle with learning. (woman) I really think that his cognitive ability is there. You could see it in his eyes that he wanted to participate, and he would get so excited about some lessons, but when he's sitting there, and it's taking all this time, he would get frustrated. He does have enough understanding and enough ability to become literate and functional, but in the regular classroom, I mean, it is more difficult, I believe, because there are more children, and he's not gonna get as much individualized attention from the actual teacher. I feel like the best place for a child like that is wherever they're learning. (Yvonne, voice-over) Our expectations are very high for Colin. We certainly want him to interact with his peers on a... on a social level, certainly want him to understand the appropriate behavior for a child his age, and so... that's a good reason for spending time with his peers. Is a third-grade classroom the best place to necessarily gain those skills? Not necessarily, in my opinion. (Kat) I know what we can do... Red light/green light. (Erickson, voiceover) I would love to see a world where we didn't have any separate special education settings, where we looked at all of the children in the school and figured out what are the ways that we're gonna meet all of their needs. The biggest frustration is that we hold children with physical and communication disabilities to a different standard than we do other children.

He is understanding symbols. (device) Lamb. (Gretchen) Oh, here's the lamb. (therapist) OK, put him back. (Dawn) I wasn't sure if what I was seeing was real or what... What I was hoping. (Erickson) Josh is probably really underestimated in the things that you're saying. Hold this day if no others in your head and realize that, um, you've raised this confident, competent child who was able to come and show that to a team of people who had never met him or you or seen his records, and he came in the door and had a fabulous day, and we learned a lot from him, and you made that happen. You've done everything right. [gentle piano and guitar composition] [sniffling] ♪ I'm sorry... Heh, heh... I'm confident that those are tears of absolute joy. ♪ [inhaling and sniffling emotionally] ♪ [sighing] ♪ It's just nice to know that... I'm not crazy, and... he is... huhh... the smart little kid I thought he was... and that... hopefully soon everybody else will see that when they look at him and not see a wheelchair and see what he can't do and that he doesn't talk and that he drools, and they'll see this smart, bright, little, intelligent, hamming-it-up kid that I see. (Erickson, voice-over) When we can figure out how to teach these children, we've figured out very important things to teach all children who struggle. I'd like people to stop thinking that there are simple solutions and start realizing that it's not about special ed and general ed. Every child has the ability to learn in some way, and our job is to figure out what that way is. ♪ (Dawn) When Karen sat down and was telling me that she felt that he was a bright kid, it's hard to express in words. It's just... so many... dreams for Josh won't happen, and... hearing her say that he was a bright kid made a couple of those dreams come back to life. [Josh laughing] (female interviewer) And after you showed this tape of that session to his therapists and to the school, what was the school's reaction? How did that affect his life at school? It didn't... affect his life at school. Two years later, he's... He's still doing his colors, his shapes, numbers... Things that I know he knows, yet he's still having to prove it. So it really didn't... it... It didn't help, um. It didn't help. (woman) Come on. Good, Josh. Come on; go fast. Come on. (Dawn) Should I push it again? Keep comin'. [voice-over] It's not that the school doesn't try, but the school's goal is education. My goal is him living in the world, and those are two different goals. Nice and tall. Look how tall you are! Look how tall you are, Josh! Ahhhh. Ready? Ahhhh. Ohhh! Crash! [applause] (Dawn, voice-over) He's more verbal. You know, he's making more noise, but I don't know that someone who hasn't been with him all the time is gonna see much difference... aside from the physical differences. It makes me sad. I... I feel like I've failed him. (therapist) He definitely does better with the mount. (Dawn) I think so. (therapist) If we can get a consistent waiting spot for him so that he knows, hand always goes back to that one spot. (Dawn, voice-over) It took us a while to find the right speech person, but I think that we have turned a corner, and, uh, we've been working with Jessica for three months now. In that... that short time, he's made a lot of strides. He's got a yes/no, a consistent yes/no, which is, for him, a big deal. Can you show her what yes is? Ahhhh. (interviewer) OK. Very good. (interviewer) And how do you say no? (Dawn) Well, I know that if you don't respond, that's a no, but how do you say no? I know. Do you like going to the dentist? No. (interviewer) OK, I didn't think so... heh. So... tell me, do you love your mom? Yeah. Eh, eh... eh! (interviewer) A lot, I can tell. That was a double yes. (Dawn) It means a lot. I'm having a conversation with my child, um. You know, I get an idea of what he's thinking and not just guessing. Did you have fun today? Mm, mm, ehhh. Yeah? He's understanding more and more what it is that communicating can do for him, and... he's trying. (interviewer) Do you think you're different from other people? Eh, eh, eh. Yeah? Ehh, eh, eh... eh. Yeah? Yes and no? I think it was both. He is, and he isn't. [indistinct talking] [motor humming] (Deby, voice-over) The one thing I never wanted was for him to not like school. I never cared about how rapid his progress was but that he make progress. I was successful in keeping him in a regular sixth-grade classroom, but... they said, legally, they couldn't modify his work from the grade-level standards. So that's where his frustration was coming in. Colin is not on a sixth-grade level, but if they modified the curriculum, he could have remained in a regular classroom. That's how inclusion is supposed to work. (Riley) There you go. (Deby, voice-over) One note that I got from him said that he was depressed and frustrated and mad and sad and bad and fat. He was giving me every bad word he could think of to describe how he was feeling. The pace was too fast. He couldn't keep up, and he would just put his head down and not do anything. He would just shut down... literally. (interviewer) How old are you now, Colin? [machine beeping] (device) I am 12 years old. (interviewer) Did you feel like you were ready to go to that new school? (device) No. It... [beeping] was... mmh, mmh too... [beeping] (Colin) mmh bedroom... That was a miss hit. Mmh (Deby) It's OK; take your time. [beeping] kitchen... [beeping] [beeping] (Deby) There, you got it. (device) hard. I... feel... Felt... sad. Mm-hm (Deby, voice-over) In some ways, I think they're just moving him through the system. I think Colin's capable of a lot. I think he's capable of reading and writing... of doing math. I think he's capable of learning about anything that he's interested in learning. He just needs more time to be able to do it. And who are you gonna write an e-mail to? (device) Lauren. (Riley) Lauren, all right. (Deby) He was transitioned to an intellectually disabled- moderate classroom. That's its label. The possibility of a high school diploma is gone for him. (device) Finish... finishes. (Riley) Good job. I can't make it happen. I haven't been able to make it happen, and I should be able to make it happen for him, and it's just not. (device) Movie. (Deby) You know, at one point in time, I still hoped he could go to college. It... I mean, it's not even an option anymore. Now, it's... I guess I just have to keep scaling back, and that's... that's hard. (device) Lauren, I made a movie today. It was about me. Good-bye. [calm piano and string score] (Deby) He needs to have his voice so that he can speak up and have people understand that he's not mentally retarded and not be stuck in a nursing home someday in... In the corner... just sitting. He needs to have a life... as active and as productive a life as he can and that... As he wants. That's my biggest fear. It really is. ♪ [mechanical whirring] So how was your test today? Good. Good. (Kay, voice-over) You think they don't consider things? (Kay) Yeah. (Sandy) You don't think that's right? (Kay) No. No. Wanna look? Eh Do you wanna read it and then... (Sandy, voice-over) The pace has become more of an issue. You know, last night she was sitting here, and it was a horrible night of homework, and we were working and working, and I finally got up and started to make dinner, and I had a helper, and she was working with Kayla, and Kayla started to cry. And I looked at her, and I said, "Kayla, you don't have to do one more problem." And she wouldn't stop. She was like, "No, I'm gonna finish this." And, you know, when she comes forward and puts that level of commitment to something, at her age... She's 14! [off-camera] Can you do that one in your head, 4 times 42? One... sixty... eight. (Sandy) Good, OK. (Sandy, voice-over) It would be wonderful if they could update the curriculum in the schools. You know, we've gotta get to a point where we do accommodate everyone in all... All sizes, shapes, and flavors. Everyone is different, and we all have our strengths, and we all have our weaknesses. Hers happened to be physical. And maybe she'd just be an average kid if she didn't have CP. I feel more confident now than I did, you know, 2 1/2 years ago. She is going to college. She's going to have a very productive and useful life. Right, kid? Yeah. ♪ [slow piano and guitar arrangement] ♪ (woman) "On the inside I walk. "On the outside I give. "On the outside I am mute.
