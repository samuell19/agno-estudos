No, you're being sloppy. - Start over. - Yes, Schoolmaster. I SHALL DO AS I AM TOLD Bend down lower. There you go. Bend lower. -Good morning, Schoolmaster. -Good morning. -Good morning, Schoolmaster! -Good morning. You'll put that out now. -Welcome back, Schoolmaster. -Thank you. The same to you. -No, never! -Okay. We'll go open this year too, right? -Yes, of course. -We can't just snuggle just the two of us. Love and freedom. -Hi! -Hi there. Darlings, over here! We're over here! Hey, Cap! See you out on the field! You look like you're in great shape! Darlings! -I've missed you all so much. -Aw! It's all he talked about this summer. So, just putting all our cards on the table, boys. First things first. We are all guaranteed to get into the Winter Procession if we want. The competition is stronger than ever, so it'll take more than a chef's tongue up your ass. You'll have to put in some effort. -We talked about... -No, it'll be fun! Let's do it. THE SCHOOLMASTER GAMES -Hello, Schoolmaster. -Hi, Joey. Welcome. I'm thinking gold and glitter... Gentlemen, welcome back to Saint Sebastian. Thank you. I hope you all had a nice summer and have regained your strength. This coming semester is an important part of your education. As you know, your special assignments and its verbal presentation is a large part of your final grades this year. Could anyone suggest some possible topics to explore? One topic could be how the 18th century's brotherhood ideal is reflected in today's mainstream bromance films. Oh! Wait! Given that it allows for an angle and analysis, it's not a bad subject. This actually brings me to something else that I want you to think about when deciding on your topic. There is always a risk in using places and times that are outside the scope of one's own... utopian... ...resources. In other words, when I say... When I say... When I say it can be tempting to look for existential legitimacy in a place or body beyond our own, what do I mean by that? Could anyone give me an example? Even the ancient Greeks would... Is he like that, Richard? His favorite place. Does anyone else have anything to add? Charles, hi there. Cute jeans. Hi, Tim. Thanks. Good to see you. Will we see you at the opening party on Friday? Right, sounds like fun. I'll try to come. Maybe we'll see each other there. Oh my God! Oh my God! He is not of this world. You all know why he has keys to the swimming pool, right? Oh yes, and rightfully so, from what I've heard. If he decides to try out, they might as well hand him the procession candelabra right away. Obviously, but it would be magic. What, I can think of lots of guys who would be awesome Procession leaders. You have no reason not to live your dreams. Let me say that again. There is nothing you can't be or have. Nothing! Try to see it in front of you. Visualize as if it were already so! My question to you is, have you reached the level you aspire to? Apparently not, because then you would already have it. Hi, Frank! You all right? You dream of being proposed to on a beach by a sexy man with gorgeous biceps, and this dream can come true! Don't you think Noak put on weight this summer? If his stuff doesn't fit him, he needs to shape up. I refuse to buy him a bigger size. Enough is enough, right? Doesn't he look as he always does? Well, that's not really the point, is it? The point is how he'll look in December. How does my ass look in these? Amazing. Mm! Isn't he divine? Careful with the shirt! Try yours as well, so we know they fit. But isn't it a bit excessive to do this all now? -What do you mean? -We don't even know if we're in yet. I did not hear that. Look at that mess, kid. Pull them down. Huh? That's for luring me in here and getting me all wet. Forgive me, Schoolmaster. And this is for carving on your schoolmaster's door. Huh? Do you want us to start leaving marks perhaps? What? What marks are you talking about? Now what have I done? Come on, let's pretend you're my swimming teacher. What's wrong? Come on, guys! Come on! Come on! Nicholas! Nicholas! Nicholas! Nicholas! Nicholas! Nicholas! Nicholas! Nicholas! It´s life, it´s life! It´s death, it´s death! Ha! You're here, guys! You're finally here! I want you to give each other a high five and say, "You're awesome!" You're awesome! Louder! Say it from here! You're awesome! You're awesome! The Winter Procession. This Academy's proudest tradition. Think about that for a second. Feel it! Some of you will be part of it. Two of you will join the list of Solo singers and Procession leaders! Right, little kittens, time for cat leaps. That's the way. Light and graceful. Nice and steady! Let's hope that'll suffice this year. Ouch! Are you all right? Up you go. Ouch, are you okay? Mm. Boys, it won't be easy for us this year. Many of you have really impressed us! You know the drill. The list will posted in the lobby one hour before the next round. Thank you all for today! - Are you about done, Chad? - Yes, I'm about done. Could you write it larger? My presentation is called "The loneliness of lust". It's is a formal academic paper, with elements of essayist freedom. By looking at our historical narrative from a social science perspective, I have aimed to analyze loneliness and togetherness in relation to erotic desire and different forms of coexisting. Hey! As an addendum, my conclusion also includes an attempt to answer the question, how do we escape the feeling of loneliness? Because the answer to my principal question is quite simple. Erotic desire can make us very lonely. Historically, erotic desire has made people very lonely. State sanctioned and public violence in different forms, often with religious undertones, have prevented homosexual men from following their sexuality. This oppression has often trapped men in shame and self-loathing. Oppression rarely makes people kind. There are ways to find strategies that reduce the feeling of loneliness. But oppression and discrimination could just as well reinforce that desired illusion of togetherness. Because yes, I would argue that togetherness is always an illusion. A will-o'-the-wisp. Desire carries the power to make us devastatingly alone. Not through oppression, or guilt or shame, but because of overpowering access to an infinite supply. It's my belief that a carefully devised system, even if I still haven't had the time to work out the details, enforcing some form of marriage of convenience would be beneficial. Through fair programs that take account of soft values, such as personality, we could find peace in predetermined relationships. We wouldn't have to waste our energy on seeking to gratify our lust. Thank you. That's all I had. Thank you so much. The guy is actually serious! Is this how you're planning to find a boyfriend, Chad? Should be we mated now? Hey, Champ! -Are you okay? -Hm? Oh. Thanks, Frank. Are those hormonal monsters giving you a hard time? Well... If there's anything I can do, just let me know. -You know where to find me. -Thanks, Frank. That's kind of you. Well, I guess I should take on the little monsters again. Who knows what they've been up to, huh? By the way, I was thinking... -Fancy going out for dinner tonight? -Well... Or some other night, for that matter. Yeah, maybe some other night. I'd love to. That'd be nice. Do you like my hands? I like your hands. -And my arms? -Yes. -My back too? -Your back too. -And my butt? -I love your butt. Do you love my face? My eyes? My nose? -My lips? -Most of all your face. Do you love all of me? What does it mean to be yourself? Frankly, I think the answer is not asking yourself that question. People who know themselves fully, couldn't possibly be very profound. Hm. Interesting, Tim. Really nice. Maybe those who know themselves don't feel the need to ponder. Not a bad thought. Does anyone wish to add anything? Does anyone disagree? Being yourself is very subjective. To express your personality in a confident, yet humble way. To feel attractive. Isn't this a philosophical question? Does the self even exist if we don't mirror ourselves in others? Interesting. Go on. We constantly mirror ourselves in other people, right? So one could argue that we are only ourselves when no one else is around, which in turn leads us to the question, do we even know we exist? That's deep. What do you say, Tripod? There are no wrong answers. No wrong answers. As I'm sure you all know, we can't offer everyone a spot. Could you imagine the Winter Procession if anyone could join? That would be... Let's see, next question... Ah, this one. What is a friend? I know. Or I think I know. Of course, you need the courage to talk about closeness and loyalty and you need to demand and strive for it. This means you take risks, because you make yourself vulnerable when you become dependent on another person's benevolence. And it always hurts, even if your friend is an angel. In the end you always get hurt. If they mean anything to you, they will, in the end, hurt you. Maybe at one point you're just out of sync with each other, which can lead to both big and small disasters. And a friend is simply a person you're prepared to be hurt by or suffer for. Thank you. Wow. Thank you. Boys, this is what I was talking about. He's more than a pretty face. Thank you, Paul. Really. You pretty much summed it up so unless someone wishes to add something I think we'll move on. Right then. Hm? You look like you're ready. What is your biggest fear? -Hey! Is this the tryouts? -Yes. Do you have somewhere I can sit? No, but just stand here with us. You can help Tripod take notes. -This isn't fair! -It's Charles! -Hi there. -Hi. Historical revisionism. Can anyone give me an example? Joey? People forget how important trans people were during the Stonewall riots. They were the ones fighting back against the police. That's an example of historical revisionism. Mm... Sure. Anyone else? What examples do we have of distorted historical narratives? -The Romantic movement offers a few... -Indeed it does. Well done, Chad. Very good. You know what I mean. You still want the presentation to be good. I've thought about writing about the shaming of bottom guys. -Couldn't that be interesting? -Sure. You can only change yourself. You are the only one who can change who you are. Look at yourself and ask yourself: Are you really all that you can be? When you look at yourself in the mirror, do you see who you want to see? If not, why? I'm sure Noak and I will be the ones who have to wrestle. - And I'll beat you up! - Really? - Yes, you just wait. - I can't wait. - I love the idea of wrestling you. - Do you now? -You two will have to fight about it. -But at least we're all in it. That doesn't mean we shouldn't put in an effort. This is crunch time. You'll be a stunning Procession leader, baby. Oh you! We're not there yet... I could never be Procession leader. Second line is more for me. Honey, you should've thought about that before indulging in milkshake floats. Have you ever seen anyone in the first four pairs to be, and I'm sorry to say, of your size? Noak! That was really uncalled for. -Tim is an idiot! -Never mind him. OK? -Okay? -Okay. Wait, I need to ask the schoolmaster something. Schoolmaster! I have a question regarding the presentation. Can I write about "what-the-hell-drugs” during the 1980s Aids crisis in New York? -Or is it too flat a subject? -Well, there are... I think there are many interesting side stories there to explore. Submit any ideas you feel unsure about in writing with a short synopsis and we'll get back to you. You know that, come on! -Thank you, Schoolmaster. -Thank you. How hard can it be to be to follow the simplest of instructions! Write a synopsis, hand it in and we'll get back to you. Wham, bam, done! Imagine if they would invest half as much energy in their studies as they do in the tryouts for the Winter Procession. -Coffee? Should I get you one? -Ah... Come on, a cappuccino, lactose free? It's nice of you, Frank, but... no. Wasn't it weird that thing Paul said? What thing? You're thinking about that now? Like we should pity him. What does he mean, suffering for one's friends? So fuck it. We don't have to be friends if it's that hard. He doesn't mean it like that. You know how he is. He exaggerates. But he makes other people suffer when he says that. And the leaders just loved it... He jeopardizes our spots. We're all in, so why not let it go? He says having friends is exhausting. I can't let it go. He is the fucking pain in the ass. Have you chosen a topic yet? No! It feels like everything has been done already. And what were they thinking, scheduling the presentations while the tryouts are taking place. I think Richard's is going to be epic. I was thinking about going through with the idea of an idealized exposition on underground gay culture in the 1950s. What? -Is it silly? -No, it's not silly. -But maybe a bit pretentious. -Pretentious? No, seriously, I can't let it go. How could he say such a thing? Hm? I have practice. You can work out with me? Bye. What am I supposed to do, then? All by myself. I really don’t understand why they'd have the party on a Thursday, a Thursday! We have to be in school on Friday. Then I also thought about all this talk about winter... Can the Schoolmaster indulge in erotic desires without chastising? Our first winner, Richard! Winners still have a shot at leads. You wait over here. Come on, Joey! Come on, Joey! No punches in the face! The winner is Joey! Our winner! Isn't this exciting? Next ones up, Fred and Noak. Get ready! Greet each other. Come on, Noak! -Let's go, Noak! -Do it! Get him! Give us some action now! Give us some action! No... Hey, guys, stop it. If you guys want to cuddle, do it in your free time. You'll be maidens, both of you. Last match of the day, then. And what a match! Two strong candidates who both impressed us during tryouts. Tim! Paul! Get ready! Greet each other Come on, Tim! Fight! Let's go, Tim! Push! And the winner is Paul! And you know what, since we have a match without winners, Tim too can join the winners. Well done. It's time for the jury to begin their deliberations. Boys. It's been an exceptional year. And we have made our decision. This year's Solo singer... Joey! Congratulations. This year's Procession leader... Paul! Well done, Paul! Paul! Paul! Paul! -Congratulations, Paul! -You must be so happy. You'll be amazing. Little Schoolmaster... -Congratulations! You'll be so beautiful! -Thank you. Nervous? You'll pull this off like you had a chef's tongue up your ass! -Say what? -Like you had a chef's tongue up your ass! You want another cider? I could get you one. I could strangle you! And who the fuck are you looking for? I guess it's time for you to start looking for Paul, now that you've scared Fred off. Well done, Noak. Really. You've ruined everything. You know what? Paul already left. And he looked even more sad in those dreadful rags than usual. I'm so relieved I don't have to look at him and his trashy outfit. Paul is sitting somewhere crying. What else is new? Uh! It's so hard for little Paul to win all these contests. "And I'm so poor, so my friend needs to buy me my... my... my... ...my fucking Winter Procession uniform!" "And then I'll stab his back, because I'm a poor little parasite trying to move up in the world." - What happened? - Noak hit Tim. Is he still alive? Sweetie, is this where you're hiding? I punched him. Tim. Wow... How did that feel? I mean... Is he okay? I'm sorry I left. Love and freedom. Yeah, but... I love you so much. -Hello. -Hi, Tim! Isn't it true that we are entitled to some help with our thesis? Absolutely. We could schedule a meeting. Are you the only one who needs help or do any of your friends...? No, it's only me. How about Friday, after class? Do you know where my office is? At the end of the hallway, where Frank has his desk, right? -That's right. -Okay, bye. Bye. Singing starts here. Sorry. Hi there. And from here. Nick has told you about when Conor wrote "The Procession Song" and "The Solo Song", right? - With a chef's tongue up his ass! - You got it, sweetheart. If it weren't for him and Nick, there would be no Winter Procession. Well, in a way, it was easier back then. It's become such a big deal these days. It's harder for you guys. But now you're here and this is going to be fab. -Joey, where are you? -Hi there. We'll start with your solo song. Let's try it. Do you know the lyrics? ♪ I never will forget The things you said were mine ♪ ♪ I'll keep them in my heart Until the end of time ♪ ♪ Soon the door will open The world is ours to see ♪ ♪ And I'll remember all But now is time to leave ♪ ♪ Like an infant in your arms That's where it all began ♪ ♪ But now that baby boy Has turned into a man ♪ ♪ Maybe we were boys back then But now we leave as men ♪ ♪ So rise again And sing your song, my friend ♪ ♪ All things that you gave Made me who I am today ♪ ♪ Love gives birth to freedom That's what I heard you say ♪ ♪ All things that you are Made me who I am today ♪ ♪ You are in my heart now You will never fade away ♪ ♪ You will never ever fade away ♪ ♪ I never will forget The things you said were mine ♪ ♪ I'll keep them in my heart ♪ ♪ Until the end of time ♪ Thank you. If Conor could see this... Just... wow. I'm floored! -Tim, I... -Stay away from me. The only thing that would be worse now is if people saw me re-used by dork-Noak's disposed toy! Stay away from me! Hi. Tim? Tim? Come in. -Hello. -Hi. Wow, isn't this... drab? And what's that mark on the door? Are there wild animals running about? So, what was it you wanted help with? Well, here's the deal. I've been quite involved with the Winter Procession this fall. I won't have a large role in the actual show, so it's not a big deal for me. But it's been pretty demanding. Which is not something they tell you beforehand, let me tell you. I guess I'm one of those persons people tend to... dump things on. Practical matters... ...but also emotional. I'm so tired, Schoolmaster! I'm sorry. Don't worry, I'm fine. Anyway... I've always felt there's something special between us. Little signs, you know. For example, if I have listened to a certain song in the morning that reminds me of a certain color, I'm like that, maybe you are too, then nine times out of ten you're carrying a folder in that color when I see you in the hallway. Oh. I just know that we're alike. -Do you know who Paul is? -Uh... Curly hair, pretty femme? Cute according to some. -He is Procession leader this year. -Oh, that's exciting. Or maybe not. The tryouts have been disastrous. Paul has only gotten his part by playing lost and innocent. And since you understand me... The Academy needs to put him in his place. It's crucial that we fuck with him. That we do something to make him get his shit together. And I need one of the teachers to help me. So, uh... So, you and I should put him in his place, you say? Sounds exciting enough... Partners in crime, you and I. I haven't really worked out a plan yet, but you're so smart... Jesus... -Get out. -Excuse me? Out! Old man. My thesis is called "The Transgression of the Faggot." It's shows how the regulation of our sexuality has been the subject of transgression in film and literature. It shows how the idea of transgression is depicted in these works. It's an informative overview, without a specific argument that I'm trying to put forward. I think we've had enough of visionary ideas from Chad already. Cut it out! It's no fun! It was just an idea! My oral presentation brings together four ideas that are explored in my thesis. I proceed on the assumption that the act of transgression is actually progressive in the context of our sexuality. Okay? Transgression is not possible without laws, prohibitions, taboos, or traditions! To exist, transgression requires limits. And limits only exist if they can be crossed and transgression becomes pointless if the limit has no resistance. Did you really fall for that one? Fucking faggot. Frank? Schoolmaster. We should try and get rid of this. Now that the semester will soon be over, we shouldn't let... It was me. It was me! I was trying to shake you up, you son of a bitch! How can you can let yourself be fooled like that? -What do you want from them? -I don't understand... You and I have seen the world outside. -Frank, can we talk about... -Please, be quiet and listen! You and I grew up thinking we were freaks. We felt there was something wrong with us. Scared shitless that someone would find out what we really longed for. And these new guys... ...those students I know you desire... ...they're all vapid. I hate them, for not having a clue. They have no history, constantly flapping their mouths. Let them wear each other out with their cute stories about how they decided to come out when Mom and Dad were in a good mood, so they could be gay in a natural and pleasant way. Do you really believe they can carry your cross? Do you really believe you will be free like them? You and I struggled with loves that were fucking impossible because it was so stained to begin with. But these new guys... ...they can experiment with their relationships. Play around. They just shrug at everything we struggled for. We thought we were building a sanctuary... ...but we've created a hell. A place where we who built it don't belong. And you let them seduce you with their playfulness. You're trying to forget everything you've been through! What do they know about you? They only see you as a remnant of... You're a dinosaur to them! I love you in a way they never could. I can love all of you. Love you for all that you are. Your calculating side. Your needy side. Because I know why you're like that. I can love those sides you try to compensate for. I can even love you for those awkward attempts to break free. But I don't love you, Frank. Frank, easy! Frank... There you go. Everything will be fine. We will have barriers out there, so you can feel safe. Well done, all of you. Now we just need to nail that flow in your movements. But for now you can all take a seat, because Charles has something for us. Move it! Thank you, Nick. Um... Well, since I don't have a given spot in the procession, we were thinking I could go last, after you. And maybe hand out something to the audience, we'll see. But I also have a song that I would like to perform. One that I wrote myself. ♪ All those days When sadness overwhelms me ♪ ♪ All those nights Without the firmness of your grip ♪ ♪ That will tell me where I belong ♪ ♪ That will tell me who I am ♪ ♪ I look for someone to take me now ♪ ♪ I look for someone as strong as you ♪ ♪ I'm so strong With your glove in my mouth ♪ ♪ I look for someone to take me now ♪ ♪ I look for something to persevere ♪ ♪ I'm so strong With your glove in my mouth ♪ ♪ I grow when you do What you want with me ♪ ♪ I look for something to persevere ♪ ♪ That will tell me where I belong ♪ ♪ That will tell me who I am ♪ ♪ I look for someone to take me now ♪ ♪ I look for someone as strong as you ♪ ♪ I'm so strong With your glove in my mouth ♪ ♪ I look for someone to take me now ♪ ♪ I look for something to persevere ♪ ♪ I'm so strong With your glove in my mouth ♪ ♪ Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm ♪ ♪ Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm ♪ ♪ That will tell me where I belong ♪ ♪ That will tell me who I am ♪ ♪ I look for someone to take me now ♪ ♪ I look for someone as strong as you ♪ ♪ I'm so strong With your glove in my mouth ♪ Maybe he was being ironic.

Don't you get why he has keys to the pool? -Oh, please! -What do you mean please? It's true! Or maybe it's just... -Isn't it epic to be here, though? -And nervous. Shit, that thing with Charles was strange, huh? What, people are strange, no? -Wouldn't you just love a burger now? -Sure. Bye, guys, See you tomorrow.
