MY MONEY SAYS HE'LL DRUM HIS FINGERS. HEY. HEY, DAD. TODAY THE BIG DAY? YEAH, I'M GOING TO PRACTICE RIGHT NOW. COACH IS GONNA TELL US IF WE MADE THE PLAYOFFS. THAT'S UP IN THE BAY AREA, RIGHT? YEAH. THAT COOL? YEAH, SURE IT IS, OLLIE. YOU DIDN'T GET THE JOB, DID YOU? NO. BUT I HAVE ANOTHER INTERVIEW LINED UP FOR NEXT FRIDAY. SOMETHING'S GONNA BREAK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. YOU JUST GO AND PLAY BALL, YOU GOT IT? YEAH, GOT IT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO HAVE REPRESENTED THOMAS GATEWICK SINCE HE FOUNDED THIS COMPANY TWENTY YEARS AGO. SHALL WE BEGIN WITH THE READING OF HIS WILL? ( tapping on keyboard ) ALL RIGHT, OLLIE. WELL, COACH IS LATE. MAYBE HE GOT THE WORD. THINK WE'RE GOING TO BERKELEY? I'M COUNTING ON IT, MAN. IT'S GONNA BE NOTHING BUT BASEBALL. YEAH! HERE HE IS. "AS THE MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER AND FOUNDER OF ZENDA, UPON APPROVAL OF THE STOCKHOLDERS, I HEREBY DESIGNATE TO SERVE AS CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS MY MENTOR AND GOOD FRIEND PROFESSOR JONATHAN WOOLEY... AND MY SON RUDY GATEWICK." Man: CONGRATULATIONS, RUDY. HMM? ( clears throat ) WELL, COACH? WE AIN'T GONNA GET IT. THAT'S IT, WE'RE OUT. I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY THAT, UH, THE VENTURA COUGARS... JUST LOST TO THE TOPANGA BRAVES! ( all cheer ) BAY AREA, HERE WE COME! AND WE'RE GONNA BEAT THOSE BUMS! ( cheering ) WELL, RUDY, WITH YOU AT MY SIDE, ZENDA'S HORIZONS ARE LIMITLESS. THE STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE DELIGHTED. ZENDA'S STAR PROGRAMMER CAN NOW GET THE RECOGNITION HE DESERVES. I'M SURE YOU AND THE PROFESSOR WILL HAVE MORE THEN ENOUGH VOTES AT THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. HMM. IT'LL BE A PLEASURE WORKING FOR YOU. OH. THANKS, UNCLE MICHAEL. RUDY. WELL, RUDY, IT MUST SEEM LIKE AN AWFUL BURDEN. I KNOW YOU MISS YOUR FATHER. WE ALL DO. I'M GLAD HE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THE BULK OF THE STOCK. THAT MEANS IT'S IN SAFE HANDS. PROFESSOR WOOLEY'S GOING TO NEED ALL YOUR HELP. WELL, SIR, THE KID IS SMART. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, BAXTER? THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY REPORTING TO A 14-YEAR-OLD? I CAN SEE IT NOW: "EXCUSE ME, SIR, I THINK YOU'VE DROPPED YOUR POWER RANGERS WRISTWATCH." "I'M SORRY. THE BOARD MEETING'S BEEN CANCELED. THE CEO IS STUCK IN DETENTION." "NO, THAT ISN'T MY SON; THAT'S THE GUY WHO SIGNS MY CHECKS." BAXTER, IT'S UP TO ME TO LEAD THIS COMPANY ON ITS TRUE COURSE. MY NEPHEW, BRIGHT LAD THAT HE IS, IS OUT OF HIS LEAGUE. BESIDES, I'M THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY NOW, AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT A GREAT COMPANY LIKE ZENDA SHOULD BE RUN BY SOMEONE WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING IT WHAT IT IS TODAY. BUT WASN'T IT RUDY WHO DESIGNED THE ZENDA TURBO OPERATING SYSTEM? DESIGNS WITHOUT THE STRONG FOUNDATION OF LEADERSHIP ARE WORTH NOTHING. MY BROTHER WAS WEAK. WITH HIM AT THE HELM IT WAS SHEER LUCK THAT WE BECAME AS SUCCESSFUL AS WE ARE. IF THIS COMPANY IS TO SURVIVE, ZENDA MUST BE TURNED INTO A STRAIGHT BOTTOM LINE OPERATION. AND I'M THE ONE TO DO IT. OH, ALICE, MOM LEFT THAT PERMISSION LETTER. HAVE YOU SEEN IT? SHE DIDN'T PRINT IT OUT YET. WELL, SINCE YOU'RE THERE, HOW ABOUT YOU PRINT IT FOR ME? ( laughs ) DON'T LET ME GET IN YOUR WAY. OKAY... ( computer beeps ) ( CG dog barks ) WHAT'S WRONG, OLIVER? IT'S JUST WINDOWS 95. YOU KNOW, I'M-- I'M GONNA DO IT LATER. ( sighs ) POOR BOY. HAD IT TOUGH WHEN HIS MOTHER DIED, NOW HIS FATHER'S GONE TOO. I FEEL I REALLY SHOULD STAY LONGER. I AM, AFTER ALL, HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN. HE WAS JUST GIVEN HIS OWN COMPANY TODAY, SIR. I THINK RUDY MAY FIND IT IMPORTANT TO RUN HIS OWN HOME. BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN ABOUT FIVE WEEKS SINCE HIS FATHER DIED-- HE KNOWS YOU'LL BE LOOKING OUT FOR HIM, SIR. YOU KNOW, WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DOWN IN DEVELOPMENT WHO COULD BE HELPING YOU OUT WITH THAT. THEY ALREADY WENT THROUGH IT. I'M JUST GIVING IT A FINAL PASS BEFORE NEXT WEEK. IT'S GOTTA BE PERFECT FOR THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. WELL, DON'T WORRY, RUDY. AT THE UNVEILING I'M SURE YOU CAN MAKE IT SHINE. I HOPE SO. WORK IS IMPORTANT, RUDY, BUT IF I WERE YOU I'D NEED A BREATHER ABOUT NOW. YEAH, I KNOW. YOU'LL GET PAST THE PAIN, BUT ONLY IF YOU DON'T CLOSE YOURSELF OFF. YOU COULD STILL COME BACK TO MY PLACE IF YOU WANT, I-- I'D REALLY LIKE THE COMPANY. THANKS, PROFESSOR WOOLEY. BUT, UM... I THINK I'LL STAY HERE. FEEL CLOSER TO MY DAD. I UNDERSTAND. WELL, THEN, WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE AFTER SCHOOL. ( computer beeps ) THANK YOU, ARTHUR. YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR. (tires screech, horn honks) Woman: HEY, WATCH IT! HEY! ZIP IT UP. WHO YA HONKIN' AT?! Woman: YOU! I HATE AGGRESSIVE DRIVERS. LATER, DAD. HEY, GUYS, HOW'S IT GOIN'. HI. LOVE YOUR JACKET. YEAH, IT'S NICE. ( horns honking ) Michael: HEY! LET ME HAVE IT! UNBELIEVABLE. THAT COUSIN OF YOURS REALLY BURNS 'EM IN. YES, HE DOES, AND IT'S A GOOD THING YOU CAUGHT THIS... BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN HURT. WELL...DID THE NEW BIG DEAL CEO GET HIS HOMEWORK DONE LAST NIGHT? HEY, DOUGLAS. MORNING, RUDY. OH. HI, FIONA. HEY, YOU. HOW YA DOIN', SWEET THING? NOW THAT RUDY'S DAD'S GONE, HE OWNS THE WHOLE COMPANY. MAN, WITH THAT KIND OF CASH, YOU CAN HAVE MY OLD MAN. MAN, WITH THAT KIND OF CASH, YOU CAN HAVE MY OLD MAN. IT SEEMS OUR NEW CO-CEO's SCHOOL BUS IS STUCK IN TRAFFIC. LET'S GIVE THE BOY A BREAK. I SAY LET'S BEGIN THE MEETING. WE'VE ALL GOT BUSY SCHEDULES. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING THIS SPECIAL MEETING. WHAT I'M ABOUT TO RELATE TO YOU IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE. IT MAY BE A LITTLE RADICAL, BUT IT'S THE BEST FOR THE COMPANY. WHAT YOU ALL HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A POINT-BY-POINT PROGRAM FOR ZENDA'S REVITALIZATION. REVITALIZATION? EXACTLY. I'VE DONE THE PROJECTIONS, AND IT'S CLEAR TO ME WHAT MUST OCCUR IF WE ARE TO AVOID WHAT'S HAPPENED TO SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS. IT'S ALL THERE IN FRONT OF YOU. A PROJECTED SIXTY PERCENT INCREASE IN THE PROFITS IF WE, A), CUT THE FAT FROM OUR OPERATING BUDGET, B) MOVE OUR MANUFACTURING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HARD-WORKING LABOR POOL IN MAINLAND CHINA, AND C) DOWNSIZE THE BLOATED DOMESTIC EMPLOYEE BASE. YOU'RE SAYING THAT OUR PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR YEARS, ARE JUST... JUST SUPERFLUOUS EMPLOYEES? WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS. AFTER ALL, IT'S THEIR MONEY THAT'S AT STAKE HERE. AND WE'VE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO PROTECT THEIR MONEY. ONE OF THE BEST INSURANCE POLICIES IS OUR WORK FORCE, CURRENTLY MADE UP OF HARD-WORKING, LOYAL EMPLOYEES. AND YOU-- YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THEM? PERHAPS YOUR HIGH-MINDED VIEWS AREN'T HELD BY OTHER EXECUTIVES IN THIS COMPANY. I SUGGEST WE PUT IT TO A VOTE. LET HIM DO IT. ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF MICHAEL'S PROPOSAL, SAY AYE. Aye. AYE. ALL OPPOSED? NAY. NAY. NAY. NAY. THE NAYS SEEM TO HAVE IT. THANK YOU, MICHAEL, AGAIN, FOR THIS VERY INTERESTING PROPOSAL. ANYTHING ELSE? NO. NOT AT THE PRESENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ( card scanner beeps ) HI. ( chatter, rock music ) OOH! COLLEGE HUMOR. I CAN RELATE TO THAT. HELLO, FELLAS. ( toy squeaks ) ( laughs ) OH. HI, UNCLE MICHAEL. GOTTA GO. SEE YOU, RUDY. WELL, RUDY, WITH YOUR NEW POSITION I'D SAY YOU RATE A CORNER OFFICE. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE THAT? NO, IT'S OKAY. I LIKE IT HERE. WELL, OF COURSE, I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD-- A RELAXING, YOUTH-ORIENTED ENVIRONMENT... HIGHLY STIMULATING TO THE FLOW OF CREATIVITY. RUDY, THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. OH. IF IT'S ABOUT THE MEETING YOU GUYS HAD UPSTAIRS, PROFESSOR WOOLEY JUST CALLED ME ABOUT THAT. HE DID? YEAH, HE TOLD ME SOME OF YOUR IDEAS. AND? UNCLE MICHAEL, I DON'T THINK MY DAD DID THINGS THAT WAY. AND ZENDA'S DOING GREAT. HIS APPROACH WORKED BEST FOR EVERYBODY, DIDN'T IT? WELL, OF COURSE, I AGREE WITH YOU, BUT... IF YOUR FATHER HAD SEEN THE LATEST PROJECTIONS, I'M SURE HE WOULD HAVE REALIZED THERE WAS A NEED FOR CHANGE. WELL, THAT KIND OF THING IS MORE PROFESSOR WOOLEY'S TURF, SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT UP TO HIM. Michael: THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN TO REASON. SO IF THEY WON'T LET ME WORK WITH 'EM, I'LL WORK AGAINST THEM. WE'LL LET THE STOCKHOLDERS DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO RUN THE COMPANY. DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY'RE GONNA VOTE DOWN WOOLEY AND RUDY? ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR BROTHER WANTING THEM IN? DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT. I'VE GOT A LITTLE INDUCEMENT UP MY SLEEVE. ONE, TWO, THREE...

BUT I'LL ALL BE CLEARED UP IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. IN THE MEANTIME, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MY COUSIN, I'LL CONTINUES THIS PRESENTATION. HERE IT IS, THE ZENDA Z-2000. OKAY.

( beeps ) --ZENDA BRINGS REMOVABLE STORAGE INTO THE 21st CENTURY. THE 892 KILOBYTE CABLE TV MODEM PROVIDES A REAL-TIME LINK TO THE INTERNET. NOW, THESE ARE SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT PLACE THE Z-2000 YEARS AHEAD OF COMPETING MODELS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT IS ZENDA'S REFUSAL TO CUT CORNERS THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO REMAIN NUMBER ONE.

( Japanese learning tape ) WELL, WAY TO GO, RUDY. BY THE WAY, I'M OLLIE. HI, OLIVER. THANKS FOR BUYING US SOME TIME. ( applause ) WHAT?! THIS IS THE KZPZ BERKELEY BROADCAST OF THE ZENDA, INC. CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. HERE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH THE ST. MATTHEWS GIANTS MAINTAIN A SLIM ONE-RUN LEAD OVER THE RESEDA TIGERS. THE GIANTS STAR PITCHER DOUGLAS GATEWICK HAS JUST STRUCK OUT HIS SEVENTH OF THE GAME, WHICH BRINGS UP TIGERS FIRST BASEMAN CHARLIE ROSEMERKEL. ROSEMERKEL'S HAD TROUBLE TODAY AGAINST THE GATEWICK FASTBALL. THIS CAPACITY CROWD IS LOVING THE GAME, AND IT COULDN'T HAVE COME TO A MORE DRAMATIC FINISH. COME ON, CHARLIE! SHORTSTOP OLIVER GILLIS WAITS ON DECK AS GATEWICK... HE PRETENDED TO BE THE KID WHEN THE REAL KID WAS OFF IN THE WOODS SOMEWHERE. HE WAS CAMPING? NO, NO, HE WAS A HOSTAGE. HOSTAGE?! YOU NEVER TOLD ME HOSTAGE! AND NOW THE OH-ONE OFFERING TO CHARLIE ROSEMERKEL. A PITCH RIGHT DOWN THE PIPE... HONEY, PLEASE, OLLIE'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT LATER, OKAY? COME ON, KID! LET'S GO, CHARLIE! IT'S A SOLID DRIVE INTO RIGHT FIELD WHICH LOOKS LIKE, YES, IT FALLS IN A FOR A BASE HIT. THIS NOW BRINGS UP OLIVER GILLIS IN A MUCH-ANTICIPATED RIVALRY WITH TWO OUTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH. YOU CAN DO THIS. NOW GET UP THERE. I WON'T LET THE TEAM DOWN. THE CROWD LOVES THIS KID. Both: GO, OLLIE! OLIVER GILLIS IS TWO FOR TWO TODAY, WITH A HOME RUN AND A DOUBLE. I KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CHEERING FOR ST. MATTHEWS, BUT KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK, OLIVER! TIME! TIME! TIME OUT IS CALLED AS COACH PALMER OF THE ST. MATTHEWS GIANTS... DOUGLAS, I WANT YOU TO WALK THIS GUY. WALK HIM. ARE YOU CRAZY? WE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE. I CAN GET THIS GUY OUT. I KNOW IT! JUST WALK HIM. DOUGLAS GATEWICK HAS PITCHED SPLENDIDLY TODAY, STRIKING OUT SEVEN. ROSEMERKEL STILL TAKES A SLIGHT LEAD OFF FIRST AS GATEWICK LOOKS IN FOR THE SIGN. THE PITCH IS HIGH AND INSIDE AS GILLIS IS FORCED TO DUCK OUT OF THE BATTER'S BOX. THE CROWD IS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT THROW. SO THE COUNT IS NOW ONE AND OH AS GILLIS PREPARES TO SEE THE OH-ONE DELIVERY. ROSEMERKEL STILL LEADING OFF FIRST. COME ON, OLLIE! ALL RIGHT! ( grunts ) AND IT'S A STRIKE ON THE OUTSIDE CORNER. IT LOOKED LIKE GILLIS WAS REALLY CHASING THAT ONE. DOUGLAS SAYS YOU'RE WHITE TRASH, AND HE'S GONNA SHUT YOU DOWN. DON'T BET ON IT. GATEWICK STEPS BACK UP TO THE MOUND FOR THE ONE-ONE DELIVERY. DOUGLAS, DON'T YOU DARE. ROSEMERKEL STILL LEADING OFF FIRST... COME ON, OLLIE! GATEWICK STEPS BACK UP TO THE MOUND... GILLIS HITS IT! IT'S A LONG FLY BALL TO DEEP LEFT FIELD WHICH GOES OVER THE HEADS OF A COUPLE OF OUTFIELDERS AND FALLS IN, AND THIS COULD BE EXTRA BASES! COME ON HOME! ROSEMERKEL EASILY COMES AROUND TO SCORE, AND NOW IT'S TIED UP AS GILLIS REPRESENTS THE GO-AHEAD RUN. ROUNDING SECOND IS GILLIS AS THE THROW IS GONNA BE CLOSE! HERE COMES THE THROW... AND IT'S NOT IN TIME, BUT THEY'VE GOT GILLIS TRAPPED. GIVE IT TO ME! GO HOME, BABY, GO HOME! AND HE THROWS TO GET GILLIS... SLIDE! YES! SAFE! AND HE'S SAFE! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! GILLIS SLIDES IN UNDER THE TAG AND THE TIGERS WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP WITH AN INSIDE-THE-PARK HOME RUN! AN UNBELIEVABLE FINISH AS THE TIGERS TAKE OVER THE BRAGGING RIGHTS FROM THE ZENDA, INC. BASEBALL TOURNAMENT WITH AN EIGHT-TO-SEVEN VICTORY OVER THE GIANTS! STAY TUNED FOR ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS JUST AFTER THESE WORDS FROM OUR SPONSOR... ( cheers, applause ) ( chatter ) THANKS, DAD.
