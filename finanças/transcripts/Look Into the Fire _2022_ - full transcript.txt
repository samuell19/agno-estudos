Most of you will drop this class. It's no concern of mine. I don't simply want to teach you about the brain. I want to give you knowledge that propels you toward another discovery. So. Put together your team and begin brainstorming. Are you on a team? Not yet. I've got some ideas. Adam, right? Yeah, Jerry? I think you and I could work well together. If you stop hitting on me. Maybe we can be on the same team field. Deal. Seth. Jordan. Hey, Samantha this... sorry. Hey, you guys have a team yet? Just us... What ideas you have? I'm interested in the connection between dreams and intelligence. What about you? I don't care... but I can organize data and stats. How about you? Well, I studied engineering... but switched the site my senior year. Now I'm interested in memory and perception. Jerry. I used to be a tech... and so I can run a scanner with the best of them. Scanner, huh? And with this, we'll be able to track your brain activity. What will you be able to see with this, if you don't mind my asking? Not much, except the stimuli of your dreams. Okay, we're ready. It's not a lie detector test or anything like that. You know, your private thoughts are still your private thoughts. Beep, Beep, Beep Your phone was going off. I think we're ready to start now. This might take a while... How about we get Chinese after this? What's wrong with Chinese? There's nothing wrong with Chinese. It's the place you get it from. They have the ownership. It's much better now. Do you guys think that we could ever read someone's thoughts? Sure. Just get a Facebook account. No, I mean to actually go inside someone's mind. You know, imagine knowing exactly what someone was thinking. Well, that would be frightening. I don't want someone knowing my thoughts. That's cause you have terrible thoughts. No, I'm serious. I mean, this could be huge. I'm not talking about the small stuff. I'm talking about bigger picture. You know, there'll be no more lies. There'd be no more secrets about who did what. You know, there'll be no more of these expensive, drawn out trials and false convictions. So how do you intend on putting yourself inside someone? You know what I mean? Ok, Alright. I don't know. I don't know yet. But don't you guys think this is... like this could be the breakthrough that Professor Hirsch was talking about? Maybe entering their dreams. Dreams don't holds any truth. They're just fabrications of memories and fiction. You'd have to enter someone's mind when they were conscious. Okay. But how would you do that? How's the data looking on this guy? Let me check. Alright, you're all done. This is all a lie. Excuse me. We know. Are you okay? We know... We know... We know... Know what? It was you. I don't understand. Look deep into the flames. Not all the work burns you will remember. Adam, help me get him up. Adam! Am I done? You're all right. You just fell off the table. Okay? We had this guy come in about six months ago with brain tumor inoperable. I mean, really young guy, super tragic. And his mom died of the same thing, you know? Anyways, we we've been trying this new chemo medication, and according to today's scans, the tumor might have shrunk. So my attendant thinks that we might be able to operate next week. Izzy, you don't have to show off. What? It's not my fault that my field yields more timely results than yours. I mean, just yield results, right? Okay. All right. That's good. All right. Tell me about your day. Hmm. Oh, all right. Well, okay. I believe that one day we'll be able to look inside the mind of a criminal, okay? And be able to determine, without a doubt whether or not they committed a crime. You know, I see their memories as proof. Are you serious? What? No, it's just. It's just. So... What? Visionary. Groundbreaking. Futuristic. Oh honey. Listen, I know it's not like neurosurgery, but I think it's something worth publishing. Yeah, I mean, I know this is your life's work, but this is so theoretical. I mean. I mean, how would you even begin to prove something like that? You don't believe a word? I'm saying this, huh? Okay. All right. No. Hey, let me. Wait, wait, wait a second. Just wait. You're right. What the others have done. It's been done before. So if. If you can find a way to prove this theory, then it could be huge. Date night's over. What? No its not. I have been on the late shift for, like, a month, and last night was 24 hours, so. Okay. The only thing I'm starting right now is a REM cycle. No. You need to go to bed, or you can go work on your project because you are not getting any progress on this tonight. You're evil. Yeah. I know. You'll take me when you have your Nobel Prize Goodnight! I love you. What am I doing? You just fell off the table. Okay? Let's do it. What? Let's actually go inside someone's mind. What? Okay, let me back up. All right? I have a proposal for this project. We've been talking about this and we keep coming back to the fact that it's crazy. I mean, don't you think if it was possible, NASA would have devised a way to do it already? Who says they haven't? Everyone. Okay, I'll show you what I have in mind, Okay? My official proposal. Oh, someone someone's been busy. So the hypothesis is that the mind doesn't forget anything. And if that's the case, then just because something can't be recalled doesn't mean it's. It's gone forever. Okay, so. Okay, so how do we how do we prove this? All right. So we we we enter a piece of information into an unconscious volunteer's mind. Okay. And when they're awake, then they just repeat it back to us. That's how we do it. Hypnotizing people. It's. It's. It's planting a thought. So brainwashing people. This is crazy, but I'm intrigued. Yeah, me too. So we're accepting that this is morally unethical, could blow up interfaces at any time, could get us kicked out of school and possibly arrested for invasion of privacy. Okay. Let's do it. Okay. It actually work out and. Hallucinations are a psychopathological phenomenon. They can affect any of the senses. But auditory and visual hallucinations predominate. Auditory hallucinations reveal no gross organic lesions, while visual hallucinations are connected to defined brain lesions. I hope he knows what he's doing. Yeah, me too. Yeah, same times. Yeah. Bye Jo. You guys want to get some lunch? I'm okay. 'll meet you there. Okay, but lunch lines pile up quick, so better hurry. Hey, is everything okay? Tell me now so we can switch back to our old project if we need to. No, I'm just thinking about what we need to do. Our patient this evening. Professor Hirsch. I hope everything is on track with the experiment. Yeah, everything is on track. The idea of intelligence being connected to dreams is a bit elementary. The mind does what it wants. Simple dreams can be complex. Complex dreams can be rather simple. Your group still has time to resubmit. Try to come up with something a bit more challenging. We'll keep that in mind. Good. Mr. Spencer. I noticed you had your head in your notebook all class. None of it had anything to do with my class. So everything all right? Oh, yeah. We're just a little behind on our experiment, is all. What's the issue? It's not really an issue. It's just, you know, coordination with volunteers. That sounds like an issue to me. You know, we have it under control. We have people on standby. Well, you and your classmates are human, too. The data isn't going to be tainted if one of you becomes a patient. Okay. I'm going to go find some brain food. Something greasy. Thank you, Professor Hirsch. What was that about? The volunteer canceled tonight. Okay. I had a concern. I brought it up. We have people back up. Said, you heard what he said. We can put ourselves into the experiment if we have to. Yeah. I don't want to be in that kind of situation. I see you at the lab tonight. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Hello. Hi, Mr. Whittaker. Oh, no, I'm sorry. Yeah, no, that's. That's totally fine. I understand. Yeah. Thank you for letting me know though. Doctor Conroy is driving me up the wall. She still wear her white coat to lecture? It's so stupid. I feel like she repeated the same lecture almost every week. We're advanced class, yet she repeat the same question for 45 minutes. It's like. Anyway, has the volunteer shown up yet? I just got off the phone with them. They can't make it tonight. Are you kidding me? Nobody wants to sacrifice for science anymore? Have you called people? I called a couple of people. Did you really? We never really coordinated who was going to line these people up. Okay, fine. Maybe Samantha or Jerry will have someone. Probably. Hey. Sorry we're late. Where's your volunteer? We don't have one. Did you guys call people? I thought you were responsible for that. No, we all were. Did you have anyone lined up? Yeah. They both backed out. Look, Professor Hirsh said that we put ourselves in the experiment if we had to. We're not doing that. All that matters is data, right? We are all human. This was your idea. At least it's just a preliminary test. I don't. Know. Still messing with the brain and can't take that lightly. Okay, so if there's any problems, we'll pull you out. You... Will.. Remember... Who said that? - Who said what? Nothing. Nevermind. Don't go all whacko on us Adam. We haven't even started. Beep, Beep, Beep Everything's looking good. We'll let him settle into REM and then we'll start. Chinese after? It is amazing that you're still alive. I've got an iron stomach. My mom used to give me leftover scraps. Are we crazy for doing this? So here's all the stuff we came up with, but we can't use any of it. It's all his ideas. We had conversations about these. Really? Yes. Welcome to what guys talk about. I think I got it. Now we just wait for him to wake up. Hey, Jerry, you ever play war? War? What are we, five? It'll pass the time. All right, fine. Solitaire for me. Beep, Beep, Beep Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. He's waking up. Uh. What happened? Did the system reset? Damn faulty power grids. We need to get this back up and running. Hey. Wake up, Adam. Where am I? Very funny, Adam. Who are you? Get away from me. Adam, its me, Samantha. Where's the cabin? Cabin? The cabin! I was just there! Guys, there's something wrong with Adam. He doesn't remember anything. -Really? Jerry, what did you feed him? It worked. Hirsch is not going to like this. No, we're not telling them anything until we know what's going on. Adam. Do you know who I am? What is going on here? Hmm. Well, your name is Adam. Adam Spencer. You've just undergone a brain procedure. What? Listen, we think that you lost some of your short term memory. We got to get him out of here. I could take him home. Can you guys pack up and we'll meet later to figure out what to do? Right. Wait. Do you guys know where Adam lives? I don't know. Get me his phone. I'm sure there's a GPS on it. Adam... What do you remember? It was in a forest. And. And I heard screams. Screams. Adam. It wasn't real. It was just a dream. I found the phone, Sam. Oh, thanks... Okay. Let's go. You sure this is your place? All right, let's see if the key works. Oh... I guess so. Do you remember anything at all? Not really. I mean, it looks a little familiar, but... So we have class tomorrow. But you might want to stay home if you don't remember anything. Yeah. Okay. Okay, goodnight. Wait, you're leaving? Well, yeah, I was going to. You can't stay? Maybe a little. We'll see if you have any food. All I found were these crackers. Hey. Can I use your bathroom? Sure. I guess. Adam? Who are you? Don't play games with me. Role playing is for later. Hey, why do you have my keys? Are you serious? Yes. Okay. I don't know who you are. You are serious. What crazy thing did you do now to make you forget me? Are you my wife? Yeah. In your dreams. My sister? You think you'd have a sister this hot? Okay. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Adam, I'm... Ring, Ring, Ring Is that your phone? I don't know. Sorry., I... Who's this? I was just. No, you're not. Not until you tell me who you are and what you're doing here. Oh, I'm just a friend. Adam... You go behind my back? I... don't... know. No, he's not. I just dropped him off, that's all. Why are you. Talking to him? I honestly have no idea what's going on. He really has no idea. Like hell he doesn't. You're a joke. We're done! Who? Who was that? I think that was your ex. I guess I could stay in case anything else happens. You're going behind my back? You're a joke! We're done! Hey, Adam. Hey, Adam, can I use your charger? Adam, are you in there? All right, I'm coming in. So if you're naked, you better speak up. Oh, my God. Adam! Adam! Oh my god, where's your phone? So when we got? 20 year old male with loss of consciousness found on floor after suspected medication interactions. I'm sorry miss, you have to stay here. Vitals unstable with elevated cranial pressure. I'm checking in. My friend Adam Spencer. He was just admitted. Friend or family? Friend. How do you know him? We go to school together. We're gonna need to contact his next of kin. Do you know who his next of kin is? No. The doctor might have some questions for you. If you could just wait in that area over there. Thanks. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Adam, you haven't picked up your phone in a month. I've been worried. Um. Hi. Who's this? You don't know me, but I just admitted Adam to the hospital. Are you a relative? I'm his sister. I think you she could tell you right away. Baywood hospital. Who is this? Samantha. Hey, that young man just came in. Do you have a chart? Yes. All right. Thank you. Hi. I'm Janet Worth. My brother was admitted here a couple of hours ago. His name is Adam Spencer. Are you his next of kin? Yes. Is he all right? He had to have his stomach pumped and few stiches where he hit his head. But he seems to be doing fine. We'll need you to fill this out. You can wait in there with the girl who brought him in. You must be Samantha. Oh, Janet. Thank you for getting my brother here. Yeah, sure. He's been on antidepressants since he was a kid. It's not your fault. He hides it from everyone. You're his girlfriend? Oh, no. I just had to help him home after an overnight lab session with some classmates. And stayed overnight? He wasn't feeling very well. My brother gets really torn up about girls. So it's best that you stop seeing him. Oh, no, I'm not seeing him. Well, I have everything from here so you can go home. Thank you again. I hope he's okay. Your brother's awake. You can go see him now. Oh, thank you. Keep a close eye on him and his behavior. If there's any reason to believe that this wasn't an accident, he may want to think about therapy or behavioral counseling to help him get through whatever he's dealing with. I'll keep that in consideration. Okay. The doctor also suggests a follow up appointment with a psychiatrist to discuss the visit and took over the doses and medication. Okay, can I have you sign here. Thank you. Thank you. I picked up your meds at the pharmacy. You should take your first pill now. Here. Do you understand why I worry? I'm the only one who can take care of you. And you shut me out. I thought you were dead. I kept calling and calling and calling. And finally the phone picks up and I thought, Thank God, a response. Then I hear you're in the hospital by a voice I didn't even recognize. I was terrified. When you get better, you're moving off campus and you're staying with me. Obviously college life was too much for you. 4 hours. Right on time. You won't get very far. Come on. Back in bed. You need your rest. It's time for your pill. Why don't you get some sleep and I'll get started on dinner. I made you some soup. How are you feeling? Better. Good. Adam, I hope what happened was only... It was okay... I don't want to talk about it. I only ask because I'm concerned. I said I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Janet. I'm sorry... Thank you. Look deep into the flames. Not all. the wood burns... Remember. A cabin. Look who's awake. I was afraid you're going to sleep all day. What time is it? Almost dinnertime. I just had dinner. Yesterday. I need some water. I'll get you some. I made you minestrone. Where's my phone? I need to call some people. Don't you think you should save your voice? What about the Internet? It's in the other room. Well, I need to use it. Maybe after your dinner. What's in it? The usual. There you go. You need your strength. Well. I'll leave you alone. Sweet dreams. Mom? About time, Adam... No. All right, Adam, where is it? That was easy. Okay. Adam, you didn't give me the password. Janet. Samantha. Screw it. You're getting photos instead of scans. I mean, this doesn't work. I'm out of here. You are a weird one, Adam Spencer. Good morning. Oatmeal. Did I hear you make coffee? You know you're not supposed to drink stimulants when you're recovering. Did you sleep well? How... is the bed comfortable? No. So you don't like it here? It just takes some getting used to. Don't worry. You have plenty of time for that. Janet! Where's my pills? I need one. My head hurts! I need one, my head hurts. You're probably just hungry. Why don't you eat your oatmeal? Just give me one pill. I'm under specific instructions not to give you more than... Its my medication. Eat your own meals and see if you like it. If it still hurts, I'll give you half a pill. I knew. It. I knew it. I knew you've been drugging me. Don't be ridiculous. What are you doing? I can't sleep. I'm going crazy. I need to focus on my work right now. Well, I don't appreciate you sneaking around here. Why don't you just ask me? You can't be serious. I am. I can't take a shit without you standing outside the door. Why are you doing this? You know I'm on to you. For years, I thought there was something off. You know, I knew that. I thought it was my depression. What are you talking about? It happened at the cabin and we're camping. You're being delusional. Leave me alone. I said, leave me alone. Why... are... you... doing this to me. The sedative I gave you last night should be wearing off soon. Recognize this? I will not have you acting out and going behind my back. Forget what you think you know. I won't have you relapsing into delusions. I'm not going. I'm telling you, I'm going to get it. Hey, guys. I got another e-mail from Adam. He better be in prison or stranded on an island. No, he's still up in his sister's house, but the situation doesn't sound good. He's really asking for us to get him out. Maybe we should let him wait there for a while, and he'll appreciate that we can't drop everything because he wants to be a drama queen. Seth, it doesn't sound good. I mean, if he's really in trouble and we don't do anything if something happens. Okay. Fine. Let's go see what's going on. And then we'll be rewarded with ice cream or Nobel Prize, whichever comes first. I guess this means I have to? I hope he gets this in time. Have you guys ever kidnaped anyone before? Chop her up real good. She needs to fit in the fire. I can't. Daddy. Do it. I can't! Get the boy to do it. Adam! Adam! Are you okay? Oh, my God. Your head is bleeding. Do you remember. What happened to my mom? Same old story... She up and left one day. My dad took care of you and me before you went to prison. I don't think she ran away. What are you suggesting? If she didn't run away. You're saying something happened to her? Did it. Hmm. Okay. Now, who's playing games? I know there's something you've been hiding from me. There isn't, Adam. Drop it. I have a blank spot in my memory. A time when I was seven or eight. You, me, my mom, your dad. We went on a camping trip and it was... Time for your medication. Damn it, something happened and I swear to God, I'm going to find out. No. You don't... What happened? Hmm? What happened? She was killed. Okay. Its what happened. You murdered my mother? How could you do that? No Adam... You did... You. I've been doing everyone a favor all these years, taking care of you, keeping you on your meds. Who knows when you would have lapsed. STOP! Well, we lost reception. Is this the place? Must be. It's the only house out here. Oh, come on, Adam. We're here. What did you tell him in the email? I told him we'd be here at 10:00. Then where is he? Did he respond to the email? Well, no. So we're waiting here for someone who doesn't know that we're waiting for them? Waste of my time. Thank you. Look, we got to do something. We can't just sit here all night. Like what? We just walk up there and say, Hey, you don't know us, but we think that you're torturing our friend. And we like him back. Thanks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, one of us has to go up there, but it can't be me. Why not? Because she knows who I am. It's got to be one of you guys. Come on, guys were blowing this out of proportion. Siblings fight all the time. He's probably fine. Pick one. Lowball whoever picks the lowest card goes in. I'm not walking into some stranger's house. Well, the other option is we just leave him there. Jerry. Fine, but I'm not doing it with you holding them. Give them to Sam. Damn it. What? I got the two. Hi. Can I help you? Yeah, my car broke down off 60 and I was wondering if I could use your telephone. I have no cell reception. Sure. Yeah. Can I offer you a drink? No, I gave the stuff up. I just meant water. Water? Sure. Phone's over there. I'll get you that water. Also, it's been a long drive. I was wondering if I could use your bathroom. Sure. It's down the hall on the left. Thank you. Okay. Okay. He's here. How do I get him out? Do I get him out? Oh, fuck. We got to go. Crazy bitch! Well, what's taking so long? I don't know. Let's give it another minute. I hope Seth's okay. Get off my property. I'll call the cops. Adam buddy, lets go. Adam, wake up. Wake up. Come on. We're getting you out of here. Adam But you got to get up. I don't know if I can carry you. Oh, Jesus. I said, get off my property. Your friend will have to walk home. We're not leaving. I'll sue you. Sue me? You're trespassing. Start the car. Our car is broken down, you crazy bitch! Don't give me that. I know who you are, Samantha. She knows. You lie to me, and I don't like that. About what? No woman who would go after a man in the middle of the night. Unless she was fucking him. I'm not fucking Adam. You have up until I get back to my house to get out of here. Then I call the cops. We're leaving them. I don't see any other choice. We'll circle back around for them. Hurry! Hurry, get in! Is he drugged? What do we do with him now? I still have the keys to his apartment. We can take him back there. No. Drop me off at home. When you said kidnaping, you do not mention this next level felony shit. Seth, you should go home too. I'll take them home. I'll just stay with until he wakes up. No. Who's going to help you carry him to his apartment? Okay. Wasted? Right on! Oh, yeah. Party animal. This guy, huh? Next time my party with you guys, bro. Yeah, that's great. I'm sure you heard that. Let's get him into the bed. Oh my god, I can't move. I seriously can take another step. You can have a couch. You kidding me? Oh my god, even unconscious... this guy gets more action than me... unbelievable. Oh, God. Oh. What is going on? We got you out of your sister's place by the skin of our teeth, I might add. What is Samantha doing in my bed? It's a long story. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. Good. Keep having breakfast and get ready to go to class. And we still to finish our project. I can't. Why not? Been working on this thing, right? Because my sadistic sister destroyed everything. Now we're back to square one. Well. Do you remember any of it? Some. All right, well, take a shower and get dressed, man. We'll figure this whole thing out. I hope everyone is making headway on their experiments. Some of the reports I've been receiving have been encouraging, but. There are some of you who seem to be stunted. And I urge you to reach out for help. Mr. Spencer. May I have a word with you? Sure. You haven't been in class in nearly two weeks. Your teammates cleverly covered for you, but I know. Professor, I can explain... You want to take some time off. It's perfectly appropriate. I had a personal emergency, and. But I'm back now. I'm good. Good. Good. I notice you got a little injury there. Oh, yeah, it's. It's nothing. I, I tripped and I wasn't able to stop myself, so. We tend to get injured when we can't stop ourselves. Sir? Remember, I'm here to help. You will remember. Yes, sir. Yeah. And that comes with the side rice, right? Okay. Yeah. A extra hot sauce, please. Okay. Yeah. Cool. How much is that going to be? Okay, great. Thanks. Janet! - You're coming back with me! Like hell I am! I'll tell you what happened in the cabin. You're a liar! Get out of here! NO! Hey Janet? Janet wake up. Janet, wake up. Izzy, it's me. Listen, I need to get here right now, okay? No, no, no. This is an emergency. Okay, I'm serious. Bring your work stuff. Okay. Hurry! Delivery. Did you order food? Izzy! She fell and hit her head on the corner of the table. Okay. This is another girl? It's my sister. All right. I didn't know you had a sister. Oh, it's my stepsister. It's a long story. Okay. Please. All right. I'll take a look. I... I don't know if I have enough training for this. Did you call an ambulance? Are you sure? I mean, she could have a concussion or could be worse. I think you really need to call hospital or something. She could have an epidural hematoma or something worse. No, we can't. Why not? Just trust me. Okay. Can we take our chances without going to the hospital, okay? What are you getting me into? So what happened? It was an accident. You did this? No, I didn't do this. No. Who's there? Just checking on my patient. Do you want coffee or tea? Coffee, please. How's she doing? Still out. But she seems stable. She should wake up soon. What happened to us? Isn't it obvious? You don't trust me? I thought I did. Then how could you just end it like that? Adam, I came home late one night, and you had a girl in your. That's not what happened. Then what happened? Can I explain to you? Please! We were doing my brain experiment Okay. And I was the patient. Okay. Something went wrong. And my short term memory got completely wiped out. Okay. Samantha brought me home, and that's when you came in. And you expect me to believe that? Yes, that's what happened. Okay. Okay. Adam, even if that was true, that was two weeks ago. And then when you finally called me to tell me to help you pick up some some unconscious, bloody sister of yours off the ground. Do you realize how ridiculous this is? It gets worse than that. How does it get worse than that? I haven't called you in two weeks because. That night, I lost my memory. I overdosed on pills. Janet. She picked me up from the hospital, and she's kept me hostage in her home, doped up on sedatives. Samantha and a couple of other classmates, they basically came and rescued me. All right. And that's when she fell in, forcing herself into my apartment, trying to kidnap me again. You should really try to get her to a doctor. Oh, shit. I'm really late for something. Can you. Can you stay with her, please? Yeah. Oh, I am so sorry. He just went right. I. I have things I have to do. What are you doing? Adam, wait! Your brother's insane. Where is he? Sorry I'm late. All right, let's just. Let's get to it. So I know I lost my memory after the last experiment. But it worked. I saw the cabin. I mean, you guys were able to get into my mind. And I need you guys to do it again. But this time, dig deeper. No, no, no, no. No way. Wait. What do you mean, dig deeper? For the past month, I've been haunted by these visions. Okay, now I know you guys don't know much about me. I don't know much about you guys, but I need to trust that what I'm about to tell you has to stay here between us. Okay. I don't think that the cabin was just an input in thought. I think it was a memory of my mother's murder. And every dream that I have tells me that I'm responsible for it. And I need to find out if that's true. What the. What the fuck? You murdered your mom? You might just need to talk to a psychiatrist or the police. I don't think we can handle this. Okay. Put in this whole. You might have murdered your mom, thing aside. What do you mean by deeper? You guys put me back in the scanner, okay? And we use the converter to read the brainwaves that are sent back to the monitor. Converter? A scanner reads images of the brain, not of the thoughts. I figured it out. Okay, so you see, the brainwaves have to be converted from. From from impulses to binary and then converted into images. I mean, it is a computer. So we need a converter that reads your brain activity? And then we're watching your thoughts like... Prime time television. Exactly. All right. I've heard enough. You're nuts. Dude, I can't. I'm out. So that's it? You're going to quit now? Yep. What if. What if I did? What if I did commit the murder? Huh? What if I had to repress my memories of my crime? Huh? You want to put me away? You want to put me away? How about you guys? Hey... So what exactly are we doing? Something that I hope is pretty cool. Okay. You want me to film this whole thing? We need you to help us hook something up and make sure it works properly. But we can still use the camera to document what happens. Hey. Hey, Jordan, right? Yeah. Nice to meet you. All right. Here it is. Have you ever blackbox cable before? So we need a line from the signal to the scanner, input it into this box and output it through that monitor. Okay. Got it. How long is going to take? Give me 10 minutes. All set. Hope it works. Only one way to test, I guess. Where's your patient? You're looking at him. Anything yet? Not yet. Maybe we should get an antenna? Hey Adam, we need you to concentrate on something simple. We need to make sure your box even works. I think we're getting something. What is that? Plaid shirts? Okay. Fire? Adam, it's working! Try to remember your visions. God, this is so weird. It's a cabin. And there's a figure in the corner. Guys. What's happening? I think he's fantasizing now. Ah, damn it, he fell asleep. Oh, Sam, is that you? What? Adam, wake up. Guys, turn that off. This is not important. Adam, wake up... ADAM! It's getting down to the wire on your experiments. I can't wait to see the results. The only question is, have you found what you're looking for? Hey, I just want to apologize. I really freaked out there. I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. We can talk about it later. Well, I'm sorry if you wanted to maybe get some lunch. Not now. We'll talk soon. Adam, I need to talk to you. So you didn't see an ax or anything? Just the cabin. But what about Janet? I mean, you haven't even spoken about her since. I haven't heard from her at all since I left. You know, I think she's a little relieved to be rid of me. I was being dramatic. But I'm glad to know you care. Oh. What's happening? Nothing. I'm sorry. I thought. It's alright, it's alright. It's sorry. I thought. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay? It's okay. Oh, good. You're home. Long day? Something like that. She's holding well. I picked up your meds from the pharmacy for you. Shoot. I got to go. I'm late. I'll see you later. Not all wood burns. What does that mean? Forever in my dreams. W. Burns W. Burns? I'm just really worried about him. You call this meeting? We need to talk. We're off the project. What? Jerry and I have been talking, and it's a crazy idea. I mean, it has been from the beginning. We are so close. Okay. Few more labs we... We literally saw inside your thoughts. Exactly! You saw inside my brain. This is historic. It's also wrong. What did you guys see in there, huh? Tell me what happened. Or is this. Is this about? No, no, it's not. Adam, we're off. We're going to submit our paper on dreams. Fine. I'll just find out the truth another way then. Why she awake? Janet told me everything. I can't believe you. What did you say to her? I told her the truth. And what truth is that, huh? The one where you kept me drugged up as a hostage in your house. Or the one where you say, I killed my mother. What did you do to me? Don't suddenly play the victim card. Okay. Whose W. burns? Where'd you hear that name? Who is it? Woodard Burns. W. Burns is my father. They put him away for the murder of your mother. What are you doing? I'm just grinding coffee. Can I have some? Fine, yeah. I'll just have my coffee and I'll leave. This coffee tastes weird. Same coffee I have every day. I've had worse. What would you do to me? Where are we? Drink up... We've got a lot to talk about. Tell me about your father. Woodard Burns. Where did you get that? Seems like you and your dad spent some time up here. A lot of families come up here. It's a national park. Tell me about Cabin six. Take me home. You can't do this to people. What's over there? Nothing. It's just a cabin. Not all wood burns. What are you talking about? Remember. Don't hurt me Adam. I remember. NO! You're drunk. Hey, hey... Stop it. Adam. Janet, leave the room. Me and you mom got a little talkin' to do. ADAM, NO!!!! Chop her up real good. She needs to fit in the fire. I can't, Daddy. Do it. I can't! Let the boy do it. Oh my god... I'm so sorry. You rot in hell! Adam. You're all done. Adam, do you know who I am? Samantha, what's going on here? My name is Doctor Conroy. Six months ago, we found a tumor in your brain. This is impossible. What's impossible? I must have passed out from the stabbing. Stabbing. I was at a cabin in the woods. My sister stabbed me. I murdered my mother. I burned her... I burned her in the fireplace. Tumors can do that to the brain. Are you saying that I dreamt the last six months of my life? Dr. Burns will be in shortly to have a session with you. Dr. Burns? Yes. Dr. Janet Burns, your psychiatrist. No... no, no, no... It'll take some time. But remember, we're here to help you. You will remember. Let me out of here... Samantha... Samantha... It's Okay, Adam. It's Okay. It appears the tumor is still progressing. He seems to have forgotten all the progress we've made since our last session. That's a shame. Such a promising boy.
