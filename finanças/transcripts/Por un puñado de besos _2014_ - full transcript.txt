They say loss is the real measure of love. This story took place during a bit of April, a tad of May and all through September. For a fistful of kisses, I went out of my mind one day. For a fistful of kisses, I found my downfall. For a fistful of kisses, I experienced betrayal. I just have memories left now. For a fistful of kisses, I don't talk about love anymore. Every time I try to forget I get drunk and regret everything. Every time I try to forget, I get drunk and regret everything. I wasn't able to forget him and he comes back to me, and he comes back here. I loved no one else since then. No one else. FOR A FISTFUL OF KISSES A BIT OF APRIL... The sun rises again. Yesterday, your heart went to bed feeling down, but, today, you woke up and that's what matters now. Fear, anxiety, ghosts of the past and ghosts of reason. Your giants' fight, your Art Histories. As long as I have any voice left, I will keep on singing for you. As long as I have any voice left... THINGS I WILL DO WITH HIM As long as I have any blood left. How are you today? There's a nice view of the sea from the window of your big city. Looking for a flower to stop and have a rest. Even if we don't play together, if you drown one day, I'll rescue you. I'll rescue you. I know that your heart has put and ad on TV. You're not asking that much after all. Just an ordinary guy who would take you by the hand and say "yes", who would go with you to see that exhibition in your imagination, who would enjoy... Dani? - Yes? - I'm Sol. - May I sit down? - Yes, sure. Sorry. What would you like to have? One beer, please. Do I look like you expected? That's not really important, don't you think? Yes, it is. I don't know, I think... Thanks. I think your letter was the key. - It was beautiful. - Thanks. - You're a good writer. - It comes easy to me. - Have you written something? - Just as a hobby. - I'd like to read it. I mean if you... - Yeah, sure. Listen... This is new for me. I don't even know if... Well, I do know... - But I don't want to rush into things. - Me neither. - This is important. - I know. Do you know why I chose you? In your letter, you said that... time is just our way of spending our life. And why did you write me? I'm not totally sure yet, to be honest, but your ad was revealing. I don't mean to sound rude, but may I see a certificate - or something? - Yes, yes. - I brought mine too. - It's not necessary. Read it, please. Shall we go for a walk? - Do you live downtown? - No, I don't. - We could have met somewhere else. - Don't worry. - Do you feel like something sweet? Hurry! - Not now... Come on! Defining Sol? That's impossible. I don't know... What does she like? She likes... walking by the sea, Saturday nights and taking photos. "Life bites", as she calls them. She also likes songs with a story, peach jam... She hates waking up early, gray days, arguing for no reason and lies in all their forms. But, above all, she loves dusting with confectioners' sugar her high moments. So this is it. This is where I live. - OK. - I had a great time. We could have a second date, to get to know each other better. And, if it goes well, another one. What do you say? Fine. Dani, don't think there's someone else. - It doesn't matter. - There isn't. Bye. Bye. Hi, Sol. In real life, love is a dream for two people, where very often one dreams while the other one lets themselves be dreamed. For those who love, time is an eternity, it's just their way of spending life. We, on the other hand, will dream and let ourselves be dreamed at the same time, together. Even if you don't choose me, I'd like to meet you. We could create a bubble and live inside it. And, of course, forgetting about shrinks. Dani. DON'T HATE THE ONE YOU LOVED Spit it out! - Interesting. - Interesting? - What? - Is that all? We talked to get to know each other a bit, and that's it. Alright. What's his job? - I don't know. - You didn't ask him? No. Well, I don't want to go too fast and overwhelm him. We talked to get to know each other a bit, and that's it. That's all. He's like me. Yeah, but it was him who answered your ad, and not the other way around. - He didn't look like a serial killer. - Right, they never do. - Did he at least prove that...? - Yes. I saw his medical certificate. Describe him. He's attractive. Very attractive. He likes the same songs I like. He's an awesome writer. I don't know, he has this mixture of shyness and mystery. And he walks too fast! I can't keep up with him! Well, that makes two of us. He has these deep green eyes. And he has these beautiful lips and an open smile. He has these strong big hands. I don't know... It went well. That's all I can say so far. So you're taking the chance. It was just about time, don't you think? It's been a long time since I last got close to a guy. You're a bastard. What's up, neighbor? I can't get these slices in! That's the problem of online shopping. You don't get to see the product, so... - Who'd have thought they'd be so thick? - Let me try. May I? Yes, here. Why are you so nervous? - I'm late to work. I have so much to do. - Relax, you're gonna have a heart attack. You know? I washed my teeth with a face mask! - All the tubes look the same. - Your teeth must be moisturized now. - Hey, this is impossible. - Yeah. So tell me. How was your date? Fine. We talked a bit and agreed to meet again, that's all. - Describe her. - 1,65 m tall. Beautiful lips and eyes. - An angelic face. - Age? She's 21. - Shit, Dani. - Did you expect her to be 30 or 40? The ad talked about "rebuilding her life". That involves having a past. - Well, you see. - So you're going on? I'm thinking about it, yes. - Don't tell me you liked her. - Yes, she's gorgeous. But... As usual, you meet a girl and your brain just turns upside down. - Come on, Lidia, I'm not that crazy. - Yes, you are. And the worst thing is you drag everyone else into your madness. Nothing will happen. We agreed to meet again. Next time I see her, I'll tell her or I'll break up with her. I don't know. Yeah, "I don't know". I do know. You're gonna mess up. We're off! Just one thing. - Is she OK or...? - Yes, she's fine. What about you? - Did she like you? - I think she did. - Well, that's dynamite! - But it'll burst on me, don't worry. - You're wrong. It'll burst on her. - I won't tell you anything else. - And don't tell Sandro. - Dani, listen to me. Mamen left, it's over. You can go out with someone else asap, but don't play the romantic hero or look for a substitute. - Or mix work with love. - I won't! Runner magazine, hello! If you're calling about the front page, yes... Dani! Your cellphone just rang. Thanks. Hi, Dani! - How are you? - I'm fine. You got ahead of me. Yes. Tonight I'm having dinner at my parents' house. They don't know, so I didn't want you to call me while I was there. Sure. How are you? I'm fine. - A bit surprised, to be honest. - Me too. I wasn't sure if you'd want to... - Go on? - Yes. Why not? - Are you still there? - Yes, sorry. - What is it? You're not sure, right? - Yes, I want to see you again. I want to see you too. So when are we meeting up? Tomorrow. I can't. Why don't we meet next Saturday and spend all day together? Next Saturday then. Will you pick me up where we met the other day? - Yes. - Great. - Dani, can I ask you a question now? - Go ahead. What's your job? I'm a web designer. - Well, that's interesting. - I've got to go now, OK? OK. OK. - Bye. Take care. - You too. Bye. Dani! Sorry I'm late! It's OK. - So? - You look beautiful. Really? What do you want to do? - Shall we walk and...? - OK. - What are you thinking about? - You said your parents didn't know. No. When I found out, I left home. To live with Gloria. She's an awesome friend. She took me in when I was fucked-up. What about you? I have my own apartment. Wow! How did it happen? I fell in love with a musician. Dario. Everyone told me I shouldn't trust him... he was trouble, singers don't fall in love with their fans, they just fuck them... But I was blind. They say silly girls give their hearts to guys who don't deserve it. To me, there was nothing else but him. He knew how to make me feel special. I was in love. Do you know what that's like? Go on. We used to take precautions, until... one night, he asked me to do it without a condom, and I said yes. Because I loved him and trusted him. Then, I took a morning-after pill, but I didn't think of anything else. It didn't even cross my mind. Shortly after, he went on tour. He called me and said he didn't want any strings attached, that it wouldn't work. And he forgot about me. He was a bastard. The day he told me he had AIDS and I should take the test was the second worst day of my life. Was the first the day you got the results? Yes. Seropositive. But I was lucky. It's worse to find out when it's too late, like he did. At least for the moment, we have another chance. We're just that. Seropositive. What about you? What about me? How did you get infected? It was a stupid mistake. I guess you feel the same way, but I don't like to talk about it, either. I slept with a girl and didn't use a condom. - Are you still seeing her? - No. It was in Santo Domingo. Something unexpected. But it happened and that's it. How do you manage to be so strong? Strong? What do you mean? I'm shit-scared. You don't seem to. What do you want me to do? You've been through the same things. First, you break down and get mad at yourself. Your plans vanish, just like your future and everything else. Dani, you and I are just time. And, if there's no time, what else do we have left? Play along with me! Hello! We're here for the apartment. You almost missed it. I was closing. But come in, please. I'll turn the power on. Come on! It's perfect for a couple like you. It needs a coat of paint and that's it. We love it. - Could you leave us alone for a minute? - Yeah... - He's a bit shy. - Don't worry. Once you're done, turn the power off and close the door. Don't think for too long! What do you think? Do you always do this to be left alone with a guy? I like to do things without knowing what's gonna happen. To let fate surprise me. Hey! You didn't tell me if you like it! - It's OK. - It's OK? You didn't see it all! You didn't see the kitchen, the bathroom, the bedroom... Dani... If this works out well... Would we move in together? - Am I going too fast? - It's just that I wasn't expecting that. Am I scaring you, being this direct? A little bit. Are you hungry? Yes. Hi, good evening. Do you have home delivery? You do? - But, when a guy comes to you, what? - I just pass. Just like that? People run away when you tell them you're seropositive. If you don't tell them, you're deceiving them. If you do, you lose them. But they might think you're playing the tough girl or the prude girl. - That's their problem. - What if you would have liked someone? - That didn't happen. - But what if it did? I don't know. I don't know. I closed my mind to it. I was vulnerable. When I realized I had to go on with my life, I put the ad. - What if no one had answered? - I knew someone would. Why? There's always someone on the other side, no matter what's your situation. - You trust humans too much. - No, I trust life. What about you? What were your plans? - I've never made any plans. - I believe you. One can tell. You live relentlessly. - Are you a psychologist? - No. I'm a woman and I'm not stupid. You are who you are. I put the ad, I called you... Many men get bothered by women taking the initiative. What if I'm afraid of falling in love with you? You're already in love with me. And I'm not being pretentious. I've noticed the way you look at me. I've noticed you're blushing! But let me tell you one thing, you haven't made me laugh yet. Oh, Dani! - I'm trivializing it because I'm nervous. - No, but you're right. Anyone would fall in love with you straight away. Anyone who has feelings. - Maybe I don't have them. - That's not true. You don't know me. We're all made of truths, lies and... in the end, there's always the same left. one look, one touch... You're a romantic, just like me. Maybe we're the last ones. Wanna dance? - There's no music. - Just imagine it. Her arms have entangled me again, they have tricked me and wheedled me, leaving me incapable of even speaking. Her body is like a magnet. If I come near it to play, it leaves me completely stunned. Her eyes tell the truth and sometimes lie without mercy, wandering about. She's like that, a woman for me. And her waist is like a yo-yo she and I play with, turning it around and around. Kissing her lips means to live, to devour this moment. My arms move slowly now, flying like a cormorant, swinging with the wind, changing the tides with gentle movements. She appears and disappears again... She slips between my fingers like a fish. I want her as if I was about to lose her. She's like that, a woman for me. Her arms are like a place to run away to and forget everything, a home, an eternity... an infinite sea - to navigate. - Yes, let's go. It was a very special night. It was to me too. - Do you want us to meet tomorrow? - Yes. Would you mind picking me up here, like a date and all that? Sure. Alright, then. She slips between my fingers like a fish. I want her as if I was about to lose her. She's like that, a woman for me. She appears and disappears again... She slips between my fingers like a fish. I want her as if I was about to lose her. She's like that, a woman for me. She's like that... See you tomorrow. A woman for me. For me. What? See you tomorrow. Good morning! Ensaimada! Great! - That is so cool of you! - It's Sunday. - And you've woken up early. - I just got home. I didn't go to bed yet. - You don't look like that. - Yeah... That's because it wasn't really an exhausting night. I've spent the night arguing with Ismael. What about your night? Good. - I like him? - Seriously? Yes. - He's so cute. - You said you were taking it slow. I know, Gloria! But now I see there's no such thing as being totally sure. You always have to take some kind of risk. Alright. Someone has to play the devil's advocate and that's me. A one-night stand is one thing. I would encourage you to do it myself! But this... What makes you see things so clearly so soon? He's transparent. He looks at me as if he hadn't seen a girl before. - Like a scared cat. - Just what I needed to hear! I don't know... There's something about him... - Delicious. - You mean the ensaimada or him? - Don't take your bad night out on me! - Leave my night alone and keep talking. - What about him? - What? - He likes me. - What if he does want a one-night stand? - He's not that type. - How do you know? - He's not! - Just because he's seropositive he has to be a good guy? - How did he get infected? - Shit, Gloria. - He had unprotected sex. - Just like that? What do you mean...? It happened in Santo Domingo and it was a crazy thing. - So he put it where he shouldn't have. - Come on! - Well, that's not a point in his favor. - Fine. Are you sure about Ismael? Alright, touch?. But that's different. I didn't put an ad and I know what he's up to. Look, Gloria. We all carry an ad around. They say: "Help", "I want to get laid" or "I believe in everlasting love". - You're ready to be with him forever! - I don't know! That's not love, Sol! That's desperation! - What? - Nothing. Sandro is sleeping, be quiet. - Do you want to talk? - Yes, but I'm in a hurry. What is it? I like her. - You like her. - More than that. - How many times have you seen her? - Twice. - And you have a crush on her already? - Yes. Even if she has AIDS? - She's seropositive. - Call it whatever you want. What do you think she'll say when she finds out? That's the question. As long as she doesn't know... - As long as she doesn't know, it's OK. - What do you think this is? Great love? Apart from the fear that you should have to have sex with her, even using a condom, I can think of a dozen reasons to ask you not to go on with this. For her, because you're gonna fuck her up, but also for yourself. Don't you see she can develop a deadly illness? - And don't you see I can help her? - Do you think it's that easy? I've been living with Sandro for three months. And I swear it's complicated. It's damn hard! - I'm not convincing you, am I? - No. No. Since Mamen left me, I see things differently. Either you tell her or forget about her. - Hey, Dani! - What's up, dude? I was leaving. Don't worry. How are you doing? Just getting by. - I can see that. - I'll leave you alone. We'll talk later. Hey, call me. Are you gonna tell me? It's a complicated story. Yeah, I figure. Knowing Dani, anything is possible. Yes, but this time it's different. Shoot. - Come on. - Later. A TAD OF MAY... Mamen! How are you? What do you want? Nothing, just see you and talk to you. Five minutes. No. - Please, it's important. - I won't get back with you, forget it. - It's not about that. - Fuck you, Dani. Mamen, I swear I won't ask you to get back with me. Really? No, this time it's about me. - I'm not interested. - Can't we go to the bar and talk? - No way, Dani! - OK. Then, please, answer me a question. Just one question. Mamen, did I make you laugh? - What? - I know it's more complicated than that, but please answer. Did I make you laugh? Yes. You did at the beginning. You were funny. You were witty and always found a way for us to have fun. It didn't last long, but it was the best part of it. What happened next? - Next, your real self showed up. - Come on. Did I treat you that bad? Dani, there was always an article, a report, a fascinating subject. Always something or someone more important. - No, that's not true. - Yes, it is true, Dani! At least, that's how I felt. I loved the Dani who knew how to move me. The one that made me feel like a goddess. That one... That one did make me laugh. Is this what you wanted to hear? What's wrong? I don't know. Are you OK? No. Who is she? - Why does it have to be someone? - I know it does. I hope you're looking at your heart for the first time. - Why do you say that? - Your eyes. They look different. Well, this is my house. This way. It has nothing to do with mine. Would you show me your room? Sure. THINGS I LIKE ABOUT DANI Stop peeking! That's private! Dani! OK, I'll stop. But just because you wrote that you like my butt. You're such an idiot! Shaggy Japanese chicks? - You have good taste in movies. - I don't like it. I used to work in this. - Were you a porn star? - No! I used to dubbed them. I specialized in Japanese movies. - Holy shit! - What? Hey, when I left home, any job was a luxury. Except working as a Playboy bunny, I did all kinds of things. And what do you do now? In the summer, I work as a waitress in a sidewalk caf?. In the future, I'd like to find a job related to photography. - Are these yours? - Yes. They're good. Thanks. Let's have some dinner. I bought Japanese food. So it's Japanese night today? I finally made you laugh. Yes, you did. Come on. - What is it? - I could never handle these. Let me help you. Look. Like this. You're terrible! Let's see... Better? That's it! Come on! Come on! - Hold on! Hold on! - It's like... It's as if I was looking at you, you know? - It's mind-blowing! - OK! Give me that! You've seen enough! - Oh! I'm coming! - No! I want to hear you coming! What? You're gross! Yes! Wait. Give me some. I can't believe it! Shit. It burns, doesn't it? What are you thinking about? Nothing. Don't you ever talk about what's happening to you? No. Denial or caution? Both, I guess. - Tell me what you were thinking about! - Nothing, really! Have you made love with anyone since you found out? No. Me neither. Do you miss it? Not the physical part, but I do miss the emotional part. What? It's there again! - What? - That look! I guess I wasn't ready for this. - What is it? You still don't trust me? - I do trust you, Sol. - I don't trust myself. - But if you don't try things, you'll never know if they'd work out fine. - Sol... - Look, forget it! Really. We... We have plenty of time for this. I know I overwhelmed you when I talked about moving in together if it worked out. But we could keep getting to know each other better and then decide. There's no hurry. Inevitable things are good and bad at the same time. Maybe. Oh, God! I'm gonna fetch some towels, or we'll get cold. - Do you want to have one last drink? - Yes. This was our third date. The turning point. What do you mean? Well... I mean we know each other... a bit more. We know what we want and what we expect. But I still see fear in your eyes. - And that something that puzzles me. - Do you see puzzlement in my eyes? Yes. Not even what we're feeling now can wipe it off? - You're incredible. - No, I'm not. But I don't want to look like I'm stupid either. Dani, I didn't know what I was going to find. I had set the bar low. Very low. You've been more than I expected to get. And it makes me so happy. So much so that I'm terrified that it could go wrong. Sol... - I need to tell you one thing. - Dani, wait. Don't say anything tonight. Let's give ourselves two days. Two days to be more sure. Yes? - Will you call me? - Sure. No, you can leave a message. When he's back... - Elias, do you have a minute? - Yes, come in. Well... How is it going? Bad. It's going bad. I don't think I will be able to write that article. - What did you say? - You heard me. You said you'd do a deep research. Something different, original, with a personal, straightforward approach. About a forgotten, taboo subject. - Yes, I know what I said. - So? Well, I've changed my mind and... I can't write it. Give it to someone else, do what you have to do, but I just can't. Listen, Dani. You're good. You've done some fairly decent things here. You've got ideas and style. It's in your blood. But that's all. You can't afford to do something like this yet. - I know, I'm sorry. - No, you don't know. And I don't give a shit that you're sorry! It'd be our special report in two weeks! And on the front page! Your first front page, for fuck's sake! What's wrong with you? - It's personal. - Shit, Dani! It's just a report on AIDS in Spain today. The way they live, the things they feel... - What's going on? - Elias, please, it's personal. Don't give me that bullshit. Where do you think you are? College? I thought you'd kill to write that report. And I would have. Have you got involved? Dani! Give me this week. OK? - You're not gonna tell me? - Not now. I can't. Fine. Aguirre got sick. Maxi will give you his notes. You write it. - Elias... - I've got work to do. How did it go? I think I need a drink. I think I need a drink too. In the three months I've been working here, we'd never talked. Sorry, I'm not going through a good time. I know. - You do? - Well, people in the office say your girlfriend left you. - Those bigmouths! - It's OK. When you think you have something serious and it ends, you feel like you're naked. Do you by chance know something about the extinction of whales? He gave you Aguirre's report, didn't he? If it makes you feel any better, I've been writing all the shit no one wants to write since I arrived. - So you'll end up doing alright. - Yeah, I guess. But it sucks anyway. Hey, do you believe in aliens? - Excuse me? - Sorry. Silences make feel uncomfortable. But do you? I only believe in the Rolling Stones. The eternal question. Beatles versus Rolling Stones. - Which do you prefer? - Debunking myths. What? I mean the Beatles-Rolling Stones rivalry is full of myths and legends. - Really? - Really. The Beatles want to hold your hand and the Rolling Stones want to burn your city. - You're a know-it-all. - That line is not mine. - But which do you prefer? - The Beatles. They were the first ones. The Rolling Stones came after. I wouldn't mind having an affair with one of them, though. - What about you? - Which do I prefer...? No. Not that. Who would you have an affair with? Listen... I'm sorry, it's not you... No, no! I didn't mean it like that. I just wanted to know your type of girl, that's all. So you know nothing about whales. No! - OK! Stop it! - Say it! Say it! - You scare me. - Me? Why? Dreams hardly ever come true. I'd like you to have your feet on the ground. My feet are already on the ground. I feel so good, so happy... - You've seen him three times, God! - So? You haven't even slept together yet, so you don't know if you really like him. Look, even if I took the best of my orgasms and multiplied it by ten, it wouldn't be even close to what I feel when he looks at me. But he's not even sure about it! He loves me. Really? He loves you? Look, the circumstances made it different. We are different. No, sweetheart, no. Everybody loves you. You're sweet, you're a magnet. Sure! But if they found out, they'd run away. So? - I'm just saying that maybe... - Look, Gloria. Dani doesn't run away because he's like me. He's like me. Yes, maybe we're living in a dream or trapped in an illusion, whatever. But this made us have hope again. The problem is... He refuses to face up to reality, he's confused... as if he didn't understand what's happening to him. What if he's desperate? Why don't you help me? Shit, all the couples start dating even if they're not sure if it'll last forever. It still sounds to me like an impossible love. Well, I don't think there's such thing as impossible love, just bigoted idiots. It's ringing. - Won't you answer it? - No. - He's been calling for days. - I know, but I don't want to. No... I'm not ready for it. Maybe when you're ready it'll be too late and you'll regret it. Gloria, I don't like goodbyes. Mrs. Amalia... Thanks for coming. How is he? Bad. I'm so sorry. I'll leave you alone. Sol! Hi, Dario. Come in, please. Thanks for coming. Sit down. I needed to see you. I've had a lot of time to think and... And I never said I was sorry. I'm sorry. Me too. Do you hate me? Yes, but not because of what you think. I loved you blindly and I trusted you. There's just one way to hate. And that word should be removed from the dictionary. - If I could... - It's OK, Dario. It's alright. It's useless to think about what could have happened. Everything is different. But not necessarily worse. I look at life differently. It hurts so much to go. Maybe you were never here. My love... Thanks for your apology, I needed it. And thanks for making me come here. - Do you mean it? - Yes. Because now I want to live to the fullest. You've always been so special. You made me feel special. You were the best thing in my life. The best thing. - I don't know what else to say. - Don't say anything. I'd like to see you smile. For the last time. Please. Goodbye, Dario. Goodbye. Come here. Bye. BOYS I WILL NEVER FORGET Hi, I'm Dani. Leave your message after the beep. Dani. I love you. Sol! Hey! Hi! It seems like the end of the world. - You're soaked! - I know. I needed to get wet. To feel alive. What are you doing here this early? Come here. What's wrong? Sol... Your Dani... - What did he tell you? - He's not "my" Dani. - Sol, what did he tell you? - About what? About his job. - That he's a web designer. - Just that? - Yes. - Daniel Torras. Yes! WHALES - I don't get it. - Look at the signature. He's a journalist. But Dani... I called the magazine... He is... He's writing a report about AIDS today. I'm so sorry, honey. I'm only asking you three questions and I want the truth. Are you the Daniel Torras who writes for the newspaper? Answer me, will you? - Sol, listen... - No! No! Is that you? Yes. So you're a journalist. Yes. Are you seropositive? No. - Come on, honey. - Sol! Sol, listen! - You've got your report. - Sol! Wait! Take this! Sol, open the door, please! She won't answer. This time, I really screwed up. Does it hurt? I think I'm immune to everything except her. Then disappear. Take a few days off. Summer is almost here. As Napoleon said: "The only victory over love is flight." - Just don't go to London. - Why? What do you mean why? Because all our idols died there. And at 27 too. Shit, Lidia. You and your sense of humor! I don't want you to turn this into a tragedy. Stop it. Dani, time flies. Keep the good memories and turn this page in your life. I swear I don't know how. I like this page so much that I don't know how to move on. Then maybe you should change the whole book. Are you a journalist? Yes. Are you seropositive? No. All the songs remind me of you. Songs always lie. But I love you all the same. ALL THROUGH SEPTEMBER. Thanks for helping me out with the report. That's the normal thing to do between colleagues, right? - What's normal and what's not? - Why do you say that now? Half the world seems to have gone crazy and the other half was already crazy. - And where do we fit in? - I was already crazy. Me too. - Do you miss her? - Who? Your ex. Mamen, right? Do you know what she said to ditch me? Only groupies, dealers and members of the band can stay in the dressing room. "Una sola notte". Do you speak Italian? The song they're playing. "Una sola notte". Just one night. And, yes, I speak Italian. - Cool, huh? - Very cool. Well, everything is perfect, Sol. - What? - You're strong as an ox. You lost weight though. Aren't you eating well? - Yes. - Well, something happened to you. - A few things, yes. - Like what? - The guy who passed it to me died. - Don't let negative things get into you. Right now, your mind is the best medicine. - You know I try to be positive. But... - Sometimes we hit rock bottom, I know. But, when that happens, we must get back on our feet no matter what. - Yes. - Why did you went to see that guy? He called me. He wanted to apologize. - Maybe you shouldn't have gone. - I know. But maybe I needed it too. Well, Sol. There's not much I can do, but you can. Take care and eat well. Go out! Have fun! You're going to live many years, trust me. - Are you dating anyone? - No. - Well, do it. - Right, like it's that easy! You're young and attractive. You have something special and you know it. - Use it. - Who would want to date me? - Give it a try. - I did. It didn't work. Was he seropositive? Did he know you...? Yes! Well, you're not the type that gives up. If I date someone and tell them that I'm seropositive, they run off. - If I don't tell them, I'm lying to them. - There's always a middle way. Look for it. Not everyone is an idiot out there. As a matter of fact, do you want to go out with me? - Not even you would dare to do that. - Says who? I'm a free man! My wife died last year from cancer. - I'm sorry. - Do you know how it feels to be a doctor and not being able to do anything for the person you love the most? But I'm here. And I'm going to live. Not just for myself, but also for her. Don't go through this alone, Sol. Share it with someone. - Long time no see. - I know. Too much work. I spend all day at the office. How are things with Marta? - Just fine. - Good! Right? - I miss Sol. - Do you really see yourself with a girl you wouldn't be able to make love with without all the precautions in the world? I've been thinking about that. - The pros and cons. - You mean the few pros and the many cons. Well, I've been thinking about it and the only thing I know is that I miss her. I think that was kind of like a rush which made you mistake love for... - necessity, work... I don't know. - No, Lidia. You didn't get to know her. She was special. - Alright, so what? - So what? - Yeah! - I fell in love, Lidia! And I screwed up because I did everything wrong from minute one! - I don't like to see you like this. - Everything can be overcome. What if come over for dinner tonight with Marta? I'll go. I swear. But when I'm in a better mood. Good. I have to go home now. How is he? Not well. He misses her. I thought he was with that girl. I don't know. I'm worried. - He should go and see her, then. - It's complicated. - I had never seen him like this. - You must go through it to get over it. I don't know... You and I... What? Will things go well for us? Who knows that? Huh? So? What did the doctor say? No news. I'm fine. Do you want to go out and celebrate? Why don't we order some pizza and celebrate here? Because it's not the same, Sol. Listen. There's a world out there that you don't see! - Come on. - I'm not in the mood. I'm really not. Do you miss him? - In spite of everything? - Yes. He acted as a real jerk. Yes, he acted like a jerk, but I don't know if he was a jerk. Because I didn't let him explain. Gloria, what's wrong? I thought you were getting over him. Well, step by step. I still miss him, but... Don't worry. - Gloria. - I'll be right back. What's wrong? Gloria! - Take it. - What's this? He must... He must have left it in the mailbox. I saw it the following day. - What? - He brought it when he came to see you. - Why didn't you give it to me then? - I don't know. I guess I... - I wanted to protect you. - To protect me? From what? - It was my decision! - Sol! Forgive me! - You had no right! - I know! Maybe now... that things have quieten down... Right? Maybe it will be easier for you to make a decision. It's OK. Sol, I don't even know how to start this letter. Maybe I'll start by telling you the truth. Just promise me you won't stop reading. Will you? I'm a journalist. My boss asked me to write a deep analysis about AIDS in Spain. To me, being a journalist is everything. Or at least it was before I met you. Your ad was just what I was looking for. The intimate side of it. You know the rest. That afternoon, as soon as I saw you, I fell in love with you. Then, when I realized what I had done, lying to you, my life turned into hell. Something changed in me since I met you. I'd never experienced anything like this. I can't write that article now. I might get fired, so, on top of all, we'll be poor. Among all the impossible loves, I chose you. I don't know what happened to us, but it happened. I don't know what came up, but it came up. Love is strange. I don't want to waste even a second. I would die for a fistful of your kisses. Would you give me another chance? Dani. This isn't working, is it? No. - Is it me? - No. Then, I don't get it. Say something, I don't know... Is there another woman? Was there another woman? And it's not your ex. No. You're a bastard, you know. Was she good? What do you mean? Sex. I didn't get to touch her. - Are you serious? - Yes. I can't picture you as the romantic guy living the impossible love story. - You're not that type. - It wasn't impossible. - So what happened? - I was an idiot. You had her, but you let her go. Yes. Did you love her? Very much. Then, yes... You are a romantic. I guess that's what I liked about you. I would have liked this to work. Me too. Take care. - Hello, Lidia, what's up? - Hey, you don't answer my calls! Yeah, I was in a meeting, sorry. What's up? - What about dinner next Saturday? - OK. - If you have a date... - No, I don't have a date. I mean if you have a "date", you can bring her too. Right. No, I don't have any date of that kind either. Hey, listen... I'm pregnant. What? You heard well. But... But did you go for it? No, not at all. The pill failed and... But it's OK. Well, I'm a bit scared. Shit! You're pregnant! I can't believe it! I've been thinking about many things and... I think you should talk to her. Did you hear what I told you? Yes, I heard. I always do. - See you on Saturday at home, then. - Bye. See you on Saturday. Excuse me. - Yes? - He waited for hours. He just left. - How do you know...? - Does it matter? Every time I saw you together, I felt love was in the air. Hurry up and you'll catch up with him. Dani! - I love you. - That's enough.
