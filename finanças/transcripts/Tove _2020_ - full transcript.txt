They're going away. "It must have been late in the afternoon," "one day at the end of August, when Moomintroll and his mother arrived" "at the deepest part of the great forest." "It was completely quiet, and so dim between the trees" "that it was as though twilight had already fallen." "Here and there giant flowers grew, glowing with a peculiar light" "like flickering lamps." I haven't seen you paint for a long time. It's hard right now. -It's always hard. Right now it's especially important. Should I paint something for our fatherland? Why not? Will you have coffee before or after your quarrel? That's not art. -Welcome. -Thank you. The war has certainly taken its toll. Oh dear, new windows will cost a lot. That doesn't work. -And there's no running water. -I understand. No, that's my hat! It's on my head! Welcome! -Dear God, here come the visual artists. -God is dead, so we'll have to manage. Welcome! -Hello. Tove Jansson. -Related to the sculptor? Yes, I'm his daughter. A bleak shadow of his genius. -Tove is a fantastic caricaturist. -Visual artist, if I may. Forgive me. Visual artist. But your drawing of Hitler and the cake was brave. Thanks. -My wife, Maj-Lis. -Maya London. Good evening. -Atos Wirtanen. -Hello. -Sam Vanni. -Come and meet the writers. Ladies and gentlemen, words are the source of all evil. Of course I'll find you here at this illegal party. -What would you like to drink? -A Manhattan, please. -What's in one of those? -I don't know. -Whisky, perhaps. -We don't have any. The man from Åland, come and dance! Wounded feelings and jealousy. Those are the things people love wallowing in far too much. Don't you ever get jealous? I can't think if I'm not free. Free from emotional noise. So, Mr. Member of Parliament is afraid of emotions? Not afraid. But you mustn't let them lead you astray. Shall we head for the sauna? Yes. Oh, I see. You don't need any help. Do you like oranges? In Morocco, you can pick oranges straight from the trees. We're establishing an art colony there. We can start from scratch, create our own morals. You and Maj-Lis are both invited. Will you come? I believe Miss Jansson is leading me astray. I believe life is a wonderful adventure. One should explore all its twists and turns. I may not be as sculptural as your father's statues. My father's work is terribly conventional. ...when it sees itself facing the necessity to focus on the peace conditions and consider all possibilities for a continued, national life. This moment has now arrived. Today, our peace delegation in Moscow signed the ceasefire agreement... Trust me. Do they like me? -Tove, you aren't your paintings. -Yes, I am. -Hello! -Hello! Good evening, Mr. Wirtanen MP. So Mrs. Wirtanen couldn't make it this evening? -Mr. Wirtanen is here with his concubine. -I see. How modern. -Vivica Bandler. -Tove Jansson. Would it be possible to commission an illustration? Today I'm just a painter. We need an invitation card for a party. My father's birthday. Call me if you change your mind. The mayor's daughter. An upper class girl pretending to be a theatre director. Pension grant for retiring artist: Friman, Jan. Paris travel and exhibition grants: Franck, Kaj, ceramic artist. Jung, Dora, textile artist. Bengts, Oscar, painter. Vanni, Sam, painter. Ståhlberg, Andrea, interior designer. Additionally, the grants committee has decided on a one year grant out of the Wuorio fund to the artist Jansson... ...Viktor. Congratulations to all grant recipients. Congratulations. You should have listened to me. Hello. It's dark in here. How do I switch on...? -Did it hurt? -No, no. Am I disturbing you? -What is that? -It's a self-portrait. Are you quite sure? Do you think I'm the rock, the fire or the storm? You're all three of them, aren't you? Do you have cigarettes? Fantastic. I've been smoking cigarette butts all day. Shall we go out? -In this weather? -Yes, in precisely this weather. Tove, this isn't a good idea. I'm going home. It isn't funny. I'm sorry. If I was to have a husband, he'd be exactly like this. Are you proposing? We know better than that, don't we? Jansson. One moment. Tell your wife not to call at such an ungodly hour. Hello? Yes. Oh, I thought that was tomorrow. Alright. Yes, thanks. Bye. I have to leave. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Well, I've come to ask you about... -The rent? -The rent, yes. -I understand. Could I possibly have a little more time? Miss Jansson, I hope you understand that my family and I depend on this rent. Wait here. Hello! Hello. Here. -Could this work? -You mean...? When I'm a famous painter in Paris, you can sell it at a great profit. Goodbye, Miss Jansson. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Nice to meet you. -Likewise. "'I have a plan, but it's a lonely one, you know.'" "Moomintroll looked at him for a long time." "'You're thinking of going away.' Snufkin nodded." "'When are you going?' Moomintroll asked." "'Now - immediately!'" "He jumped down from the bridge and sniffed the morning air." "It was a good day to start a journey." ERIK VON FRENCKELL 70 YEARS WELCOME Thank you. Thank you. He likes to fight, to hold his head high and look ahead. I believe that everyone in this room remembers Erik as a delightful spirit who wants the best for everyone. On behalf of the executive committee for the Greater Helsinki Entrepreneurs, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to our honourable Mayor. During many years of fruitful collaboration, we have learned that he is not only a man of his word, but a true hunting connoisseur. How dare you? Welcome. Father, this is my friend, Tove Jansson. She's an artist too. If someone jumps off a cliff, you don't have to follow them. -Happy birthday. -Pleased to meet you. And thank you for the lovely invitation card. Very ingenious. Ingenuity is my hallmark. In my family we always feel sorry for people who aren't artists. But I always say that without the bourgeoisie, we'd have no work at all. Isn't that right? -No, don't waste the champagne! -So sorry! -Cheers! -Cheers! Smoking girl. -I really like your painting. -You do? Have you ever kissed a woman? -Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you. -No, just come on out. This is my husband, Kurt. -Kurt Bandler. How do you do? -Tove Jansson. Pleased to meet you. Just to let you know, they're asking for you in there. See you later. Miss Jansson? We're preparing a room for you. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Thank you. -Thank you, very much. Breakfast? -Did you sleep well? -Yes. No... One Christmas he ate Baby Jesus. The monkey, I mean. But mum said: "He'll come out, eventually." Then a week passed and he came out, all black. Come in! Do you need anything? Do you want something? Thank you, Miss Poikolainen, we have everything we need. I could see you were a Mymble straight away. You could? Thingumy. Bob. Give me a kiss. Thank you. You should get married. I'll never get married. Is that so, my little artist? It's very convenient to be married. "'Smoke', said Bob." "'Foke means smood', said Thingumy nodding." "And they began to wander down to the valley" "talking in the strange way that Thingumies and Bobs do talk." "It isn't clear to everyone but the main thing is they understand each other." "'Do you think we could go in?' asked Thingumy." "'It depends', said Bob." "'Don't be frightened if they're gross and grumpy.'" "Very cautiously they tiptoed up to the house" "and stood shyly by the front steps." I haven't really eaten today. Or yesterday. I got carried away by the painting and... -And you're broke. -Yes. As a matter of fact, I want to talk to you about something. -So do I. -Let's hear it. I've found a new room... ...in an old house. A new room? You mean in Morocco? No. I mean the inner room. The house of the soul. I slept with a woman. What are you thinking? Well, that was... an interesting experiment. Wasn't it? An act of freedom. Right? Yes. This is tasty. Unnecessarily tasty. So what were you going to say? I was thinking that my newspaper Ny Tid could commission something from you. Perhaps something for children. You have those stories of yours. And we'd pay you. You can do what you like. Would it have to be something serious? -Something class-conscious? -Well, I... About labourers and so on? All newspapers have comic strips for children these days. Imagine how annoyed your father would get. You drawing comic strips for a socialist newspaper. Well, that would certainly be a bonus. -But it would slow my real work down. -One strip a week? Let me think about it. May I ask... What was it like? It was like...an irresistibly beautiful dragon had arrived. It just attacked me and flew away with me. Did the dragon...remain hungry? It didn't look like it. I mean, will it attack you again? There was no mention of that. SARTRE: THE RESPECTFUL PROSTITUTE DIRECTOR: VIVICA BANDLER -I don't remember anything. -What a shame. I undressed in the bathroom and when I got back, you turned red in the face. Don't you remember that? I also said: "Here I am, and you're red as a crayfish." Don't you remember that you wanted to turn off the lights and make love in the dark? I thought you were so nice and respectful. -Don't you remember? -No. Thank you. Cut! I want to hear what's behind the lines, Camilla. Her deep sadness. Like when you're madly in love, even if you shouldn't be. And you're terrified you'll never see the other person again. Excuse me? Hello. I'm Tove. Tove Jansson. Sorry to disturb you, I... I'll be on my way. Miss Jansson? Thank you for coming. Let's meet for a coffee and talk about that manuscript. -I'll call you this afternoon. -Yes. Tidy away... Jansson. Watch out! That's a bit special. I can see that. -Cheers. -Cheers. -What are these? -They're just for children. -That's the Groke. -Yes, you can almost see that. She's so cold that everything she touches turns to ice. How did you think of all this? It's just scrawl. It distracts me from my work. They look quite mad. They can't be totally sane, can they? Do you like my paintings? They're nice. But those are special. -Show me those again. -Do you think this is funny? -What? -I have no inheritance, receive no grants. I draw those to make a living. This is me. It's me. You silly girl. -Just go on. -You upper class witch. MAP OF MOOMINVALLEY COMET IN MOOMINLAND -Good morning, beautiful. -Good morning, my love. I miss Paris something terribly. -Paris? -I have to go there soon. What? I see. Come. Come to Paris. You know I can't afford that. You'll think of something. Oh! Long time, no see. Hello. -Coffee? -Yes, please, that would be nice. I'll just light the stove. Then don't bother. My visit will be short. -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm fine. High ceilings. It must be expensive to keep this place warm. Yes. It's good enough for an artist, I suppose. I'm sure there's plenty of light. But sooner or later it'll need renovating. How well are you selling right now? Well, it varies. I'm more familiar with your father's work. -He's a fine sculptor. -Yes. Anyway, the City Board would like to order a fresco. -Is that so? -Yes, for the City Hall. How nice! "Thank you for your letter. Or for all of your letters." "Please, mark the envelopes with different senders" "so that no one wonders why someone writes to me every day." "You would love Paris." "You can't imagine the amount of places here for 'ghosts' like us." "The Seine's left bank, mon Dieu! Rive Gauche." "But I'd be even happier here if we could experience all of this together." "Nothing is quite the same without Thingumy." "I hope you'll come soon, now that you can afford it." Is this a key artwork that emerged through conscious choices? Or did you allow the intrinsic value of art to define the overall narrative, considering the personal character of the artwork? What are you saying? I'm just thinking that it may be a bit humiliating for Vivica's husband. Well...then he'll just have to let reason triumph over his primitive emotions. Is this humiliating for you, Atos? No. I'm not narrow-minded. I don't have any other man but you. And I have no other woman but Vivica. Isn't it fantastic, Faffan, that Tove made that lovely work of art? Yes. My congratulations. -It was well received. -"Well"? It was wonderfully received. But I still didn't get a grant. -I don't know how many times I've tried. -I'm so sorry. My darling. Perhaps you should start painting on canvas, not dining room walls. Then how will I afford the paint? Your time and talent are misspent. You should just paint. I've tried to help and guide you... -With well-known results. -Yes, blame it all on me. -Doesn't her happiness come first? -She mustn't give up. I will never give up. -Unless she already has. -Faffan! Come here. He just lost that sculpture competition... ...to Wäinö Aaltonen. WELCOME HOME BOB! I'm so looking forward to sleeping on my own bed sheets. Tove! You came to meet me. Irja Koskinen, dancer. We met in Paris. This is Tove Jansson. Painter and fantastic children's book author. -I'll take a taxi. -No! I'm having a party. Why should anyone go home? No, everyone is invited. Absolutely everyone. Why not? What fun! Horror is the fashion everywhere. The theatres were full of amazing horror shows. Every night, we'd sit in the auditorium being frightened. Can you imagine? Irja and I are working on a dance performance together. -Welcome. -Thank you. Oh, my God! You're all here! Tove... Salut, mon amie! -Welcome back! Ça va? -Ça va très bien. -What is it you do again? -I'm a ballet dancer. Sorry, I borrowed it. Tove, what do you think, should we put on a play about the Moomins? Or a musical? Moomins don't dance. I see. Maya! Oh, dear. Here you go. Cheers! She's an expert at that. Seducing, deceiving... But the leaving is all up to you. -Did she mymble with you too? -Vivica's been with everyone. -Not with me. -That's too bad. -Poor me. -Yes, you poor man. Why? -Why what? -I thought... I invited you and you got money from dad's commission. That took me forever to finish. I thought you were a free spirit. Stop sulking. Is it alright if I stay the night? You can stay the night. Irja can stay the night, Göran and Sam can stay the night. Everyone can! Are you angry about something? I only want to tear you to pieces. -Write that play for me. -No. Yes. No. Yes! -Hello. -Hello. The Vivica Bandler Fan Club was here yesterday. -A self-portrait? -Yes. She's swimming around here in her stream of consciousness. -How are you? -I went to Mariehamn. Filed for divorce. And bought myself a new hat. Congratulations. Of course, a married philosopher is a ludicrous paradox. -Said Nietzsche. -Exactly. But I'm a ludicrous paradox anyway. I've been thinking about marriage. -Oh? -Yes, so would...? I mean... Is that what you want? No, no... Or I thought you wanted it. Or... Of course I do. A little. Not that much. I didn't say anything. Has anything important happened here? Well... ...Vivica wants to direct a Moomin play. I promised to do the scenography and costumes. Great. HAUNTED HOUSE No, no, no... There. Fear the revenge of the lost bones. THE SWEDISH THEATRE May I ask you a question? Why is Moomintroll so kind all the time? -How do you mean? -Does he never get angry? What do you say to that, Tove? Why is Moomintroll so kind all the time? Is he scared of being disliked? He's scared of all sorts of things. He just has so many feelings. Love makes him brave. But if that's threatened, he gets angry. Go with that. What on earth are you doing in Booble's matchbox? -He are widing! -Say what? Speak properly. I can't understand you. Te are werrified of Booble! He frightened us. Do you understand them? That's Thingumy and Bob! They have their own, secret language. Earth has been saved Earth has been saved Moomintroll has saved our day The comet is gone The comet is gone Never will it come back this way You nailed it! Thank you, all. See you tomorrow. Sleep well. -The usual rules apply. -What rules? No drinking and no screwing before the opening night, alright? Yes? I'm serious, no one gets to screw. Unless you really need to. Thanks, Tove. What would I do without you? Well, see you tomorrow. More colour. More colour! Bob? Tove? Tove! You will come for the opening night, won't you? Dragons don't get attached to humans... ...as far as I know. -Propose to me. -What? Do you want to get married? Or have you changed your mind? Are you serious? Dead serious? Not just right now? I've never been more serious in all my life. Will you be my wife, Tove Jansson? Yes. Now that I become your wife... ...will you also take care of my finances? Maybe. If you stop buying such expensive clothes. The wife of a socialist can't walk around like that regardless. I guess that means no more red wine either. Only cut brandy from now on. Good. In that case you can buy expensive clothes. Good morning, my wife. What are you thinking about? Vivica. You don't want this? Maybe not. Tove... ...I haven't succeeded terribly well at not feeling too much. Forgive me. The comet is gone Never will it come back this way Bravo! Here you are. -Hello, what's your name? -Olle. What's it like to be so loved? I'm not the one who's loved. But the money is nice, of course. Will you come to the Nordic Prisma exhibition in Paris? No. Sam will be exhibiting. It would mean a lot to us. Lasse... -How's it going? -Fine. There's one thing here. That's good. -What are you looking for? -My artistic identity. -Ça va? -Salut! So, what's your analysis? They're fantastic. -But what do I know? -Tove! You're a brilliant artist, you know that. -Sam, here's to you. -Thank you, my friend. -Hello. -Perhaps you remember Tuulikki? -Hello. -Hello. Maya said she had a hard time persuading you to come. Yes, I've become a bit of a recluse lately. So much work. My brother Lasse is helping me at the moment. Oh, I didn't know he worked with comic strips. Neither did he. They're powerful. They have...oomph! How about it, Tuulikki? Perhaps you could show us all those exciting places by Rive Gauche? Certainly. Tove. Good to see you. -This is Coco. -Enchanté. Would you like to sit with us? Maybe later. -Hello. -Hi. We're moving on. Are you coming? -I think I'll stay here for a while. -Fine. See you later. A proposition! -Let's continue the evening at my place. -Oui. -Oui? -Why not. -I think I will leave, after all. -No, Tove, don't go. -Stay for a while. -Au revoir! Au revoir! Tove? Tove... Now that you've come all this way, I think we might as well spend some time together. -And what about your friend? -Who? Are you happy? Seeing you makes me happy. Were you always sure about wanting to work with theatre? No. At first, I wanted to make movies. -But then theatre? -Then theatre. I don't know what I want to do. Comic strips. Theatre. Write. Paint. -I want to do it all. -Then do it. I love you. I've never loved anyone the way I love you. I love Paris. My God, how I love Paris. Now I'll have to let you out into the wild again. I don't understand. Into the wild, where beautiful dragons live. What are you trying to say? Farewell. Tove? Tove, don't go. You're not leaving, do you hear me? No more. I loved posing for him. He was so focused. I was always afraid you'd get cold. I did. I'd like to have this one. If I may? I knew you would. -I know he wanted you to have this. -What is it? See for yourself. -Hello. -Hi! -Thanks for coming. -Thanks for opening the door. Sorry! Come inside. Thanks. Have a seat. How nice. You're painting. It isn't finished. What is it called? The Beginner. Tove continued to paint all her life and wrote several novels and short stories. She and Tuulikki lived together until Tove's death in 2001. Her friendship with Vivica and Atos was lifelong. Vivica had a successful theatre career. She later regretted not having had the courage to return Tove's love.
