- Good boy. Whoa. Good. Good boy, Barkley. - Barkley. - Hey, bud. All right, buddy. Good boy. Good boy. You ready? - Barkley. - Jodie, hang on. - It's fine. You girls go on. I'll right behind you. - Are you sure? - Look. That was Bridgett Van Heusen. - Welcome to the Addison County Fair. This is the first call for class number 12, Vermont Junior Young Rider Championship qualifier. Please start making your way to the ring. Riders, you are now being judged at the walk. - Wait, where are you going? Bridgett's not done yet. - I've seen enough to know. She'll win this local hay seed event. - 18 doesn't seem to be very straight. Leaning too far back. - 32 is leaning too far forward. - Okay. - Trot, please. All trot. - 18's doing really good. - 32, leaning too far forward. - O6 has the wrong bit. - She's not staying in line. She's out of position a lot. - 82's doing really good. - Yeah. 82. - Keep an eye on number 45. - Okay. 32. - In fifth place, number 65, Astrid Clemons and Scarlet Lantern. In fourth place, number 32, Madison Newton and Royal Exposure. Third place, number 45, Addison Lowery and Frog Prince. In second place, number 18, Vyvyan Laurenza and Cathy Super. And in first place, our champion, number six, Bridgett Van Heusen and Barkley. - Good job today, kiddo. - Thanks. - All right. Give it to me. - What? - You won. You told me, and you won. - Yeah, I did! This was a complete waste of my time. Told you I'd win. - It's 'cause you have the best trainer. Don't forget it. - Your turns were sloppy, and Barkley's trot looks horrible. You have a lot of work to do if you're going to defend your title at the championships next year. - Congratulations on winning, Bridgett. - We're sorry for intruding. My daughter wanted to meet Bridgett and see Barkley up close. - My dream is to ride a horse like Barkley someday. - Was she in an accident or... - Um, she was born with a curvature in her spine. Her mobility is limited. - You riding a horse is not very realistic, is it? - What did you just say? - What is wrong with you? - Oh, please. They may wish to coddle her, but I do not have to. I'll meet you back at the house. We have much to discuss. - Maybe I should go talk to her. - She'll be okay. Just give her some time. - I swear... That woman just got me so, so mad. - I know, but you can't get worked up like that. Your heart- - I know. I know about my heart. - Where are you going? - Jodie isn't the only one who needs some time alone right now. - Do you think Bridgett Van Heusen's mom is right? - I think... Sweetheart, people like her are insecure about themselves, so they take out their insecurities on other people. - You didn't answer my question. - I think that woman has no idea what you're capable of. Hey, you're a fighter. You've never let anyone tell you what you can and can't do. You're not gonna start now, right? Right? - Right. - That's right. - I love you, Mom. - I love you too. - I see you're perusing about the room again. - Yeah. - Your family has a rich tradition of success. For over 200 years, the Van Heusens- - Ronald, you've told me this story a hundred times. - Then I shall tell you 101. For over 200 years, the Van Heusen family has maintained a rich tradition of excellence. Scholars, surgeons, lawmakers, and champions such as yourself. And now it is your time to carry on this tradition into the annals of history. What wonders might you accomplish, Madam Bridgett? - I don't know what I wanna do with my life. This is a lot to live up to. And with my parents pressuring me, it's hard sometimes. - I'm confident you will find your calling. - Thanks, Ronald. This is a lot to live up to. And with my parents pressuring me, it's hard sometimes. - I'm confident you will find your calling. - Thanks, Ronald. - You have been slacking in your job for months. - Victoria, we're not gonna fire Jimmy. - Why are you talking about firing Jimmy? - Lately, your skills have become stagnant. To be honest, they're actually regressing. - I pay Jimmy's salary, and I say he stays. - Fine. But only under the condition that Bridgett must improve. If she does not, he is out. - Is that fair enough for you? - Okay. - Did you see what she just did to me? - Yah. - Ride didn't help? - Don't talk to me right now. - Okay. How about now? - I swear, you're all trying to drive me crazy. - Look, rides are good to get out. And sometimes, they're good to blow off some steam, but, sooner or later, you're gonna have to face your problems head on, kiddo. - I'm gonna take a bath and then go to bed. - Is everything okay? - I'm just nervous about Jodie's appointment tomorrow at the back specialist. And if I have to see that crushed and disappointed look in her eyes again... - I know. I know, baby. I know. But here's the thing, we're a family. And no matter what happens, we'll get through it together as a family. Always. ♪ Tear down these walls ♪ ♪ You've built so high ♪ ♪ There'll be days that seem like endless nights ♪ ♪ But darkness always becomes alight ♪ ♪ Stay here with me ♪ ♪ You'll learn to trust ♪ - Nice to meet all of you. - Do you think you can help Jodie? - Well, after going over Jodie's medical history and reviewing her file, I think we can help her. We're gonna surgically implant titanium rods to straighten Jodie's spine. Over time, and with rehabilitation treatments, I think Jodie could walk without crutches and live a life of more independence. - You really think so? - Well, that's the goal, but you're gonna have to work very hard to get there. - I will. - After you told me about Jodie's love of horses, I put in a call to a unique rehabilitation facility called Helping Hooves. They use horses during rehab to help their patients. - Will I get to ride their horses? - With your positive attitude and some hard work, I believe, over time, you'd be strong enough to ride their horses. - Thank you, Doctor. You don't know how much this means to Jodie and my family. - I think I have a pretty good idea. - Do we really have to talk about this again? - Yes. You need to decide what college you'll attend. - This could be one of the most important decisions you make. - But I don't know what I wanna major in. - With your brilliant mind, you'll study medicine or the law. - I don't care about the law. - It has nothing to do with caring about the law. This is about establishing yourself in life and being successful. - And not being an embarrassment to the family. - Correct. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. Hi. You must be Sandy. I'm Carol. We spoke on the phone earlier. Welcome to the farm. You must be Jodie. - Yes, ma'am. - We've been expecting you. Shall we go over to our picnic area so I can show you around a bit? - Sure. - So here on the farm, we're about community. We like to encourage friendships. We work hard, we play hard. You're gonna have a great time. Feel free to watch the horses, observe, and see what we do here. During the day and night. Some horses stay in, some stay out. And it just gets them comfortable. We usually bring them in the day when we're working with students, and then they get to go out at nighttime. And all the horses have a different day off 'cause it's nice to have a vacation, right? Do you like school? - Mm, sort of-ish. - Yeah? You wish it was horse school, huh? - Yeah. - When did you first start to like horses? - When I was little, my dad gave me a stuffed animal that was a horse, and ever since, I've loved them. ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ - Find everything you need? - Just about. You? - Yeah. Just need to get some chicken feed. Where's Jodie? - She's where she always is when we're here, in the horse room with the saddles. - Still don't know why I had to come. Why couldn't you get the saddle for me? - You're the one who wanted the saddle, right? - Yeah. - Okay. Gotta learn to do things for yourself. Not everything in life will be handed to you. - I drove us here. - Is that what you call that? - Oh, you think you're funny? - Have my moments. - Five minutes, in and out. Get what we came for and leave. - Hey, Cole. - Okay. - Hey! What do you think you're doing with my saddle? - You okay? Are you hurt? - Just my pride. Hey, Bridgett. - Do I know you? - I met you at the Addison County Horse Show. Let's get you up. - Yeah, I met a lot of people there. I don't remember you. - Can you hand me my crutch? - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh, I remember you. Grab the saddle so we can leave. - Sorry about her. She can be a bit rough. - It's okay. We all have our days. - Yeah. Well, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get the saddle before- - Jimmy. Let's go. - Too late. - Take care. - Same to you. ♪ You don't even know my name ♪ ♪ Looking through me just like I'm not there ♪ ♪ But you and me, we sing ♪ ♪ Living in the shadows, hiding the pain ♪ - Mr. Van Heusen. - Oh, thank you, Ron. - Of course. - Did you not ask Ronald to bring me a drink as well? - I wasn't sure which week you were coming outta there. I almost sent in a search party. - Would you like your usual, Mrs. Van Heusen? - Yes. - Right away. - Thank you. - Of course. - You're always disappointing me. - Why are you disappointed about not getting a drink? - I do not care about the stupid drink, Stephen. I'm talking about you not helping me with Bridgett. - What am I not helping you with Bridgett? - You do not support me. I try to keep her driven and disciplined. - Yeah, Bridgett's drive and discipline is fine. - She is not focused, Stephen. - Bridgett is fine. - That, that's what I'm talking about. - The only nonchalant attitude I have is with you. - I have your drink, Mrs. Van Heusen. - I need a refill. - Right away, sir. - God. If I didn't love her so much... - Why did you say, honey? - Nothing. But I do love her. - Should be any time now, huh? - Yeah, I'm so ready. - Do you think we're rushing this? Maybe we should've taken some time, gotten another opinion. - No. Mm-mm. We've taken Jodie to see plenty of doctors. This is the time. This is her time. - Mom, do you think you can teach me how to do a cartwheel? - What? - When I'm better, can you teach me how to do a cartwheel? I've always wanted to do one. I'm gonna be okay, Mom. - We'll be doing cartwheels together. - Hi. - Hi. - You ready? - Yeah. - Welcome to Mountainview Hospital. - Ms. Davis? - Yes? - Your daughter's out of surgery. - Is she okay? - Yes. You can visit her in the room if you'd like. - Oh, yes, please. Dad. Dad, wake up. Jodie's ready. How does she look to you? - She looks just wonderful. - Mom? - We're here, baby. - Hi. Good to see we're all here. - How did Jodie's surgery go? - It went very well. She responded like a champ. - And so she'll be... - She should be just fine. Now, for the hard part, the hard work in rehab. She's gonna have pain, things will be difficult at times, but it's been my experience that patients with the best attitudes have the best results. - Unicorn. - What? - I want to ride a unicorn. - In Jodie's case, I don't think having a good attitude's gonna be a problem. - I told you I'd be okay. - You sure did, baby. - Jimmy? - Yeah? Did the Van Heusens need something for me? - No. I came to see you myself. I don't think anyone would fault you for taking today off. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, if I didn't do any work, then I'd be languishing all day. - Do you care to go for a walk? - Yeah. Yeah. - Come. - Okay. - How long has it been? - Eight years. - And how old was your daughter? - She was six. Alison and I were so blessed when little Savannah came into our lives, you know? There's so much to look forward to as a family. I don't know, after everything, I felt like it was only right to have the organs donated, you know? - Yes. - For so long, I didn't feel anything, not anger, not resentment, nothing. I felt numb. - As I recall, you were training someone the night of the accident. - Yeah. Yeah, I lost track of time, I told Alison that it'd be a while before I got home. I should've been the one driving that night. - There's nothing you could've done. - Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I could've seen the other driver, avoided the accident altogether. Something. - Jimmy... - You know, losing my wife and daughter was like having the soul ripped from my body. I don't know if I'll ever forgive myself. - Their accident, it wasn't your fault. - Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Hmm? - Very well. If you need anything, you know where to find me. - Thank you, Ronald. Maybe one of these years, I'll... Gotta believe in myself. - Jodie? Hey. Have you seen Jodie? - No. Isn't she in her room? - No. I just checked and she wasn't there. - Jodie! - Jodie?! - Jodie? - I'm out here. - There she is. - How long have you been out here? - Maybe 20 minutes or so. Today's my first day of rehab training, and I'm ready to get started. - We should get going. - We having one of those bonding type moments right now? - Nope. I wanted to ride with you to apologize. - Apologize for what? - What I'm about to put you through. I'm gonna train you harder than I have before. Just don't want you to think I'm being ugly with you. - You worry too much. I'm going to win the championship again. - Bridgett, you are good, there's no doubt about that. Somewhere out there, someone is training while you're sitting here being cocky. - Are you done? I'm already bored. - There's that fire. That's good. You're channeling it in all the wrong ways. You have the opportunity to win the 18 and Under Horse Show Championship three years in a row. But you won't if you don't stay focused and train hard. - When do we start training? - Right now. - Okay, Jodie, I'm not gonna sugarcoat things. You've got a challenging road ahead. But with the right attitude, hard work, you can do this. - I'm ready. - Good. Let's get started. - Okay. Almost halfway. - Let's call it quits for today. - Okay. When can I ride a horse? - As soon as the doctor says you can. - Okay. - Eyes front, mister. - Ready? - Yeah. - Jodie, Jodie. I have a surprise for you. - What surprise? - The doctor gave us the go ahead for you to start riding a horse. - They did?! Can I ride a horse right now? - You sure can. I can go get Chester ready for you. - Thank you, Stacy. - Hi. It's nice to finally meet you. I'm Ethan. - Hi, I'm Jodie. It's nice to meet you too. Do you work here? - I do odds and ends type of work. Carol's my mom. - They're gonna let me ride a horse. I'm so excited. - Uh, is it okay if I go see you while you ride? - Sure. - Okay. I'll see you out there. - Okay. See ya. - Bridgett, you are not allowed to fail. - I don't care about some stupid reputation. - Maybe you do not care now, but one day, you will understand. - Not if it means I'll become anything like you. - Very good. Breathe. It's a working trot. Very good. - Whoa. Good boy, Barkley. Did good, Barkley. - What was that? - That's enough for today. - No, no, no. It's enough when I say it's enough. Where you going? Wasn't your best day, was it? - Save it. I had to hear it from my mom this morning, I don't need to hear your mess too. - What are you talking about? I'm trying to help you. - Whatever. You're using me, just like my parents. - What are you talking about, "using you"? - You have to have your job threatened in order to do your best with me? If you lost your job here, you'd be homeless. You're so selfish. All of you are, and I'm sick of it. Congratulations, Jimmy, you made me a better rider. You get to keep your job. Now leave me alone. - It's not a day in paradise, hey, bud? Come on. - Mom?! - Jodie! Here. Let me help you. - I can do it. I said, I can do it. I have to get stronger. I'm sick of living like this. - I know every day seems like eternity, but you will get there. - We just had this area be completely redone. - It's beautiful. Looks wonderful. Coming along. - You'll have to come back with us soon. This summer, come back. - Yeah. - Maybe when the weather is cool. And the color is so... It's almost like looking at a painting. - I can't believe- - No. No. That's so funny. I was thinking exactly the same thing. - We call that picturesque. - Mm. So I'm right. So good. - That's nice. - Thank you. I picked it up... - Go away. You can come in. - Your parents have requested you to come say hello to their guests. - The Winfields? Snore and borefest. - It would only have to be for a few minutes, and then you can retreat back here. - Okay, fine. Fine. - Eleanor, how are your children? - Oh, well, our Abigail just finished her undergrad from Princeton, and she'll be attending Harvard for her law degree. And our Jeffrey Jr. just received his PhD from Stanford. - Oh, a doctor. I thought he was a liberal arts major. - Yes, well, we talked some sense into him. - Yes. And how about Bridgett? She must be approaching college age. - She'll be graduating soon, with honors, of course. - Of course, of course. - And has her pick of any Ivy league university she wishes to attend. - Here's to our children. They're the best of all of us. - And to us. We raised them well. - Uh-huh. - Cheers. - Sounds like the loggers are here. - Oh. - It's getting very loud. - The Millers, they're clearing some of their back land. They're always making noise- - The Millers, we were discussing that. Always doing something. - Why don't we go inside? - My goodness, Stephen, I've never seen this room before. It's quite impressive. - We don't like to show it off. - This is the most recent first place trophy Bridgett won. - And what happens when Bridgett marries? The Van Heusen name will end at her wedding, will it not? - Yeah. I suppose you are correct. - Would've been wonderful for you to have a son to carry on the family name. - Well, unfortunately, you can't always get what you wish for. - What is that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Nothing we need to discuss now, Victoria. - For goodness' sakes, be a man for once, Stephen, and speak your mind. - Right. Fine. All I ever wanted from you was a son, a true heir. All I got was... - Me. - Bridgett, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there. - Have a great night. Thank you very much. Thank you, we appreciate it. - And we'll see you swimming. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Of course. - Where do you think Bridgett ran off to? - Well, I don't know. She's out here somewhere. Maybe she's in the stables. Come on. - Yah! - All I wanted from you was a son, a true heir. You seen Bridgett? - Yeah. She just took off on my horse. - She what? - She just took off on my horse. She seemed pretty upset. I think I'm gonna go check on her. - Okay. - I'm gonna get keys and we'll get her. - I'll check with the neighbors, see if they've seen her? - Yeah, okay, go do that. - Come here. Come on. It's okay. My horse came back up without her. Get in the back and buckle up, yes. Bridgett! Bridgett! - 911. What's your emergency? - Mrs. Van Heusen, now is not the time or place to be drinking. Your daughter's in the hospital. - That hurt right in the back, does it go anywhere? Okay. What about the forehead here? We're pulling up to the hospital now. - How is Bridgett? - Bridgett suffered a compound fracture to her upper right leg. Her lower back and her hip have taken some damage as well. We're prepping her for surgery. I will let you know the minute I have more information. - What were you thinking, letting her get on that horse? - Mr. and Mrs. Van Heusen? - That's not my husband. That's Bridget's trainer. How is she? - Bridgett's surgery was successful. The road to recovery is gonna be long and hard for her though. But she should be fine. - Thank you, Doctor. Did you call Stephen? - I'm not concerned about Stephen. I just want Bridgett to be okay. Yes, I called and he's on his way. - Sent some flowers. They should be here soon, I guess. - How are you feeling? - The doctor says it's gonna be a long process, but you should make a full recovery. - I am confident she'll be fine. - Hey, listen, about what you heard, I know what you're feeling- - Don't tell me how I feel. Just leave. - Bridgett- - Get out. - It's okay. - Jimmy, what are you doing? - I'm quitting. - No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. What happened to Bridgett has absolutely nothing to do with you. Hey, hey. Bridgett needs you. You can get through to her in ways that her mother and I can't. Come on, stay. Please. - Very well. - Thank you. Thank you. - Yeah. - Come on. It's okay. - I'm so sorry. - She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine too. Come on. - Your father sent you these. He'll be coming along shortly, okay? Okay. I'm just gonna check your IV, okay? Okay. Looks good. Here you go. Okay. - Hey. I remember this day. We had so much fun. I know you miss your daddy, sweetheart. I do too. - I just really wanted him to be here to see me get off these crutches and ride a horse. - Your daddy's looking down on you, and he sees you every day, Jodie. I know he's very proud of the young lady you're becoming. - I just wish I could hug him one more time. - Your daddy did give the best hugs. - So do you, Mom. - Hi. Just came by to see Bridgett, see how she's doing. This is a family thing, I can come back later. - You're fine, Jimmy. I'll go grab some coffee and you can visit with Bridgett. - Hey, kiddo. How you doing? - What's it look like? I'm ready to win gold in gymnastics at the Olympics. - Still got that fire. That's good. Look, I'm sorry I let you get on my horse like that. - Couldn't have stopped me. - You wanna bet? I could've dragged you right off of him. - Doesn't matter. And I don't blame you for this. I blame my parents. Will you help me to walk normal again? Please? - You are gonna have doctors and nurses who are gonna help you. Plenty of people. You don't need me. - Please. You're the only person who can get the best out of me. Please. - Okay. - Promise? - I promise. - Jimmy? - Yeah? - I'm scared. I'm scared, Jimmy. - You're gonna be okay. You're strong. You're a Van Heusen. - It's overrated. - Well, it looks like it finally happened. Jodie is smitten. - Oh, I know. I've been following them around for weeks. With those blurting little looks and, oh, my goodness, isn't a gross? - Ah, young love, disgusting. But oh-so beautiful and pure. - Oh, I know. I know. They're so precious. - That's it. Slow. Good. There you go. - Okay. That's good. - 22 steps, that's a new high for you. - I really wanted to get to 50 today. - You'll get there soon. You're the strongest girl I know. - Ethan to the office, please. Ethan to the office. - My first kiss and a horse. Can't get any better. - Madam Bridgett. Your parents are looking for you. They've had the back terrace beautifully decorated for your 18th birthday today. - So this is where the Van Heusen legacy ends, with me. - Nonsense. - You didn't hear my parents that night. - Your parents, they are the way they are. But make no mistake, they do love you, more than you know. - There you are, birthday girl. Nice wheels. - Not funny. - Mind if I take her for a spin? - Be my guest. - Uh, hello? You should be asking me... - Nope. You would just say no and be sulking in this room all day. - Jimmy, stop. Where are you taking me? - Come on. But don't go anywhere. I got something for you. Happy 18. You don't look a day over 30. Huh? What do you think? You like it? You don't like it? - The guitar is nice, Jimmy. Thank you. Why are we out here? You know I can't ride. - Yeah. But it beats sitting around sulking all day in that stupid room, feeling sorry for yourself. - Yeah, well, it doesn't matter anymore. I'll never live up to any of that stuff. - Thank goodness for that. - Look, it might not mean anything to you, but to my family, it does. - What does it mean to you? - I just told you. - No. Said it means a lot to your family. What does it mean to you? - I hate it. It's a constant reminder of what I can't live up to. I'm not some world class scholar or renowned doctor or some great humanitarian. Just some girl who rides a horse. Now I can't even do that. The night I got hurt, I heard my parents say that they wished they had a son, but all they got was me. I always knew they didn't love me, but to hear that, to actually hear them say that? Now look at me. My life could be ruined because of that. - Look, I know you're hurting, okay? And I know what that must feel like, but you gotta stop feeling sorry for yourself, okay? Focus on getting better. Look, you're the composer of your life, so if you wanna get back up on that horse and start riding again, I'll be there like I promised. If you don't, well, it's your choice too.

That girl who fell off my saddle. - Did you get hurt or something? - Nothing gets by you. - Is today your first day here? - Jodie, let's keep working on your steps. Come on. - Okay. See you later. - Mind if I take over? - Absolutely. - All right. - Did you have a great first day? - Yeah. It hurt a little. - That's normal. Some soreness is to be expected. - It gets better though, right? - Yes. You did very well. You should be on crutches soon. I did want to tell you about a great rehab facility called the Helping Hooves who specialize in situations like yours. - Yeah, Helping Hooves is a wonderful facility. They actually specialize in using horses during rehabilitation. People there are amazing, it's outdoors. I think you're gonna love it. - If you'd like, I can give them a call and see if they'd give you a tour. - Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks. - Thanks. - Wanna get outta here? Let's go, kiddo. - So Mr. and Mrs. Van Heusen, this is our facility and what we have to offer for Bridget's therapy. - It all looks pretty good to me. - Shall we go to the office and get some paperwork? - Sure. - Get her scheduled and get things started up. - How you feeling? - Little tired, but I feel okay. - You'll get better. Takes time, patience. Huh, bud? - Bridgett, is that you? - Oh, God. Kill me now. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. It's nice to finally meet you. - Charmed. - This is Barkley, the horse you won with? He's so beautiful. - Yep. - You ready? - Yeah. See you later, Bridgett. - Is it me or is she so nice she's annoying? - Grab yourself a bucket of grits. Let's go. - I don't even know what that's supposed to mean. - Hello? - Yes, sir. I'm looking for Mr. Jimmy Campbell. - Speaking. - Mr. Campbell, my name is Betty Wilson from the Stanford Heart Care Hospital. Our hospital performed a heart transplant for a young girl eight years ago. The donated heart came from your daughter Savannah. - Um, yeah. What's this about? - The heart recipient's family has requested your contact information. - For what? - Sometimes, a recipient family wishes to say thank you and show their gratitude for the transplant. - I see. - This family would like to introduce you to their daughter. She's the person who received your daughter's heart. May I give them your information? - Um, I don't know. I didn't expect any of this. - I know this is sudden, Mr. Campbell, but would you consider it? - Can I think about it? This is just a lot. - Yes, sir. I can call you back in a few days if that's okay. - Yeah. Yeah, thanks. - Thank you, Mr. Campbell. Enjoy the rest of your day. - Yeah. - I know this is sudden, Mr. Campbell, but would you consider it? - Can I think about it? This is a lot. - Yes, sir. I can call you back in a few days if that's okay. - Yeah, thanks. - Thank you, Mr. Campbell. Enjoy the rest of your day. - Yeah. - Need some help? - Can't get the stupid saddle on and keep him still at the same time. - Want to get on? - Not yet. - Have you tried? - No. - Then how do you know you can't? - You're a pesky little thing, aren't you? - Come on. I'll spot you. Okay. Hang on to me and see if you can grab the mane of the horse. - Got it. - Grip it tight. - It's tight. - Good. Steady. Well, you have a lot of work to do. - I know how to mount a horse. - Not like this you don't. See? I need you could do it. - Well... Well, look at you. - Yeah, look at me. - I helped her. - Yeah. Yeah, you did. Starting to hurt my back. I need help getting down. - Okay. All right. Easy. Lean forward. There you go. Okay, right there. You okay? There you go. Good. I'll take him. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Hey, buddy. That was good, kiddo. Proud of you. - Thanks. Ready, Barkley? So good. It was so good. - You're one step closer. Hello? - Mr. Campbell. This is Betty Wilson following up with you. Have you had enough time to consider speaking to the recipient family? - Yes. Yes, I will speak with them. - Great. I'll pass the information on. - Okay. Thank you. Have a nice day. - You too. - Hot date? - Get in the car. Hop along. Beautiful horses. - Always are. - Yeah. You enjoy yourself? - Yeah, it's been fun. - Not bad, huh? - Yeah. - Sure are looking at them a lot. Sure if you take a picture, it'll last longer. What? Where you going? - Uh, hi? - So, what's your story? - Uh, my story? - Do you find the cutest new patient and make them your girlfriend until the next cute girl comes along? - I am so confused right now. - Just remember one thing, Jodie is my friend. Treat her right and never hurt her, or else. - Or else what? - Uh... - Uh, hey, Jodie. Your friend, she wanted to have a talk with me. - My friend? - Got your back. - What just happened? - I honestly have no idea. - You making friends? - Yeah. - Okay. Good. - Jimmy Campbell? - Yeah. - David McClain. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - I'd like to introduce you to my wife Katherine. Katherine, Jimmy. - Hi. Nice to meet you. This is our daughter Tiffany. - Hi. - Nice to meet you, Tiffany. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Campbell. - Please, call me Jimmy. You like to ride horses? - I don't ride, but I think they're really pretty. - Yeah. They're magical creatures, aren't they? - Yeah. - Would you like to talk while we go on a walk, show you around? Would you like that? - Yeah. - What's your favorite color? - I like green. - So pardon the question, but after all these years, why reach out to me? - It was all Tiffany. She wanted to meet the family that gave her her heart. - I wanted to thank you and to thank your daughter. I owe her my life. I'll do my best to make you both proud. - Thank you. Means the world to me knowing that my daughter Savannah's heart made it into a nice, young lady. - May I give you a hug? - Yeah. Thank you. I needed that. - Me too. - Got something for you. It's my wife's. My daughter Savannah and I bought it for her for her birthday. - It's gorgeous. - Think she'd want you to have it. You like it? - Thank you. Yeah, I love it. Could you please train me how to ride a horse? - Mom? Dad? - That would be great. - Yeah? - Of course. - I think so. - Step right outside. I'll bring the horse right around, okay? I miss you so much.

We're so proud of you. Thanks. Still hurts to ride. It's getting better. - Yeah, good. - We wanted to speak with you about the horse show championships. - What about them? - You need to compete and defend your title. You must step up your efforts immediately. - Can't you just give me a break? I'm already working as hard as I can. - Will she be ready? - Competing will be asking a lot. - Well, if she's not ready, it's your job to get her ready. - Come on, buddy. You know what? No. I can deal with you two tearing each other apart, but I will not let you do it with Bridgett any longer. They say that the worst pain in life is losing a child. And when I lost Savannah, I can tell you that that pain never goes away, ever. But you two still have Bridgett. She's right there waiting for you to show her that you love her. I just don't know how much longer she's gonna wait. So cherish her, treasure her, before you lose her forever. - It's okay to cry sometimes. - Need to get you a bell or something. You appear out of nowhere. - I saw you arguing with your parents. Do you wanna talk about it? - No. - Okay. We can just sit here, then. - You're like the annoying little sister I always wanted, but never had. - And you're the grumpy, old sister I never had. So, we're even. Ethan told me what you said to him. - Sorry. I didn't mean to scare him. - It's okay. Nobody has ever done something like that for me before. Thanks. - Can we just sit here for a while and not say anything? - If that's what you want.

Just, please- - What were you doing out here? - Trying to walk. I have to get stronger. I might not be the son you always wanted, but I won't allow the Van Heusen reputation to change with me. - Listen, nothing in this world has ever given me more joy than being your father. Nothing. - Then why did you say that stuff about wanting a son? - I was stupid. I was bragging and... I don't care what the Winfields think. I don't care what anybody thinks about us. And I'm so sorry if I ever made you feel unworthy or not good enough. I never want you to feel that way. You're the best person that I know. - What about the Van Heusen legacy? - The Van Heusens have had a good run, but now you need to focus. Go out there and make a name for yourself. - Thanks, Dad. Hi, Emma. How old are you? - Three. - You're three? I started riding horses when I was three, just like you. You met this horse? - Mm-hmm. - This horse's name is... - Jessie. - This is Jessie. Isn't she pretty? All right, do you wanna ride Jessie? - Yes. - Yeah? Okay. Jessie's given a lot of rides to a lot of kids. She's great. Jodie, can you come here for a second? - Sure. - Okay. You good? - Yeah. - Hang on to this with your hands, okay? Okay. You ready? - Ready? - Let's go. Emma's good. Yeah, she is. All right. - Hey, Jodie. Let's hurry up or we're gonna be late. - Okay. - I just need to grab my purse and my keys. - Here you go. - Oh. Thanks. You can... - Yeah, I can walk by myself now. - Since when? - Since earlier today. I couldn't believe it when it happened. - Your dad would be so proud of you. - Mom, don't cry. You're gonna make me cry all over again. - I don't care. Dad! - Jodie. You're walking. - There you go. Did good. You okay? - Still feel achy. - You're getting stronger. You'll get there. - Yeah. - Proud of you, kiddo. - Good boy, Barkley. - You looked good out there. - Not as good as you. When did you start riding so fast? - Just started. It feels magical. I'd stayed a talk, but I don't want this to end. - She sure does love to ride, doesn't she? - Yeah, she does. - Hey, squirt. Follow me. Where are we going? - You'll see. Jimmy? Can you come here for a second? - What's going on? - So we both know I won't be physically ready in time for the horse show championships. - Okay. - So I want Jodie to ride in my place. - You want me to do what? - Wait, hang on, she can't ride in the- - I've never competed before. I'll be terrible. - We can train you. - Wait, what do you mean "we"? - You know how to train, and I know Barkley. I already turned in the submission forms. Oh, come on. We can do this. I know if we work together, you can win. - You really think I can win? - I don't know how to fail. Jimmy? - Okay. - Great. But don't take it easy on her. Train her like you would train me. - You ready, kiddo? - Yeah. - Let's do this. Do it again. All right, there you go. Is that so, Barkley? Bless you, bud. Now do the swim again. There you go. Very good. All right, now do a two-point. - Why are you having her do two-point? - She needs to strengthen her muscles. She's almost there. - Almost. - Still gonna need a lot of training time with her. - My parents are out of the country for a couple weeks. We can train there. - I don't know if that's such a good idea. - Why not? - Have you met your parents? - They're not there though. Heels. - She can be tough. Yes, we do. Good job. - Good. Nice, Jodie. It's better. - Good stuff. - Soften the inside shoulder on the canter. That was good. Where you going? Go back and do it like I told you. Where are you going? - I need a break. - There are no breaks. - There are now. - You got quite the set of pipes there. - I don't know if I can do this. I'm scared. - If you weren't scared, I would think you weren't taking this seriously. - I just wanna do a good job. For you, my mom, my dad, my grandpa, and everyone like me who thinks they can't live their dream. - You have to do this for you too. All that other stuff is great, but you're the one on that horse. We all believe in you. You have to believe in yourself. Where you going? - Are you coming? We have a lot of work to do. - Let's do it. - You're doing a really good job. Proud of you. - Thanks. - She's got a good trainer. - Learn from the best. - Don't you forget it. - You know, Jimmy, after teaching little Emma how to ride, I just feel like found a new path in my life, what I wanna do. It was good. Proud of you, kiddo. - Thanks. - Okay. - What are they doing? - Being a kid. - Hey. - You missed the spot. - Hey! Are you off your crutches? - And no back brace. Tossed those things today. No looking back. - Hmm. So, I can totally do this to you and it's okay. - Do what? - Who's the squirt now? - You little brat. - No! Jodie. - Bridgett, are you okay? Bridgett. Bridgett! - You asked for it. You asked for it! - No! Hey! Stop! No! No, Bridgett! - What did I do now? - I know about your little ruse for the horse show championships. - I knew you'd find out. You always do. - Either you ride in the championships, or nobody will. I do not even know who this Jodie Davis girl is. - Why can't you just love me for me? - What are you saying? Of course I love you. - When's the last time you touched me with a loving hand, or told me you love me when it wasn't after I won something? A three-year-old little girl was afraid to ride a horse. I helped her overcome her fear, and she had a blast. Felt amazing to help someone. It's like I finally found a calling for myself. I'm right here, Mom. I always have been. - I felt responsible when you got hurt. I felt I had to push you to get better, to become strong again. I'm exhausted, Bridgett. I do not want to push you anymore because of what it's done to us. - Then stop pushing. Bring me close to you. I wanna feel your love for me, in here. - Stephen? - I came in here to think. And then I started to reminisce. - Reminisce about what? - All of it. The history and the meaning and knowing what's important. Knowing that none of it's really important. - Seems we've both come to some realizations tonight. I just spoke with Bridgett. - Oh, are you both going to your neutral corners for a while? - Quite the opposite. We made amends. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Well, that's great. - It will take more than one conversation to make things right, but I feel we've started a new course. - Hmm. Well, I wonder if maybe we could start a new course too. I mean, if we both wanted to. - Do we? - Yeah, I do. Do you? - I do. - Baby steps? - Baby steps. ♪ You don't even know my name ♪ ♪ Looking through me just like I'm not there ♪ ♪ But you and me, we sing ♪ ♪ Living in the shadows, hiding the pain ♪ ♪ Your heart is home, your words unkind ♪ ♪ Drying unseen tears that never seem to fall ♪ ♪ I see through you, you are blind ♪ ♪ Tear down these walls ♪ ♪ You built so high ♪ - Can I come in? - Yeah. - Are you nervous for tomorrow? - Yeah. I can't sleep. - This is what's next. - What do you mean? - Every day, every night, for years, I've looked in on you sleeping in this room and I'm always amazed. - Why? - Because you've conquered every challenge you've had to face, from losing your dad to learning how to walk on your own. And now, this horse show is what's next. And just like all those things, you'll conquer that too. - After Dad died, I cried for what felt like forever. I heard you cry at night, but you'd always stay strong for me. I get my strength and my courage from you, Mom. You're my hero. - You're mine. You're mine, baby. - You ready? - Ready as I'll ever be. - You got this. - Ethan, you came. - I wasn't gonna miss this for anything. Do you wanna go for a walk? - Sure. I have time. Can you hold this? We're gonna win this, okay, Barkley? For Bridgett, Jimmy, and especially my dad. We got this. I love you, Barkley. Gonna have to help me, okay? We got this. I'm really nervous. Gonna be there with me in the ring. I know everything's gonna be okay. - What do you think? - I don't know. What does Barkley think? - Huh? - It's great, right? - You love it? I loved it. - You're gonna kill it out there. Come here. I wanna show you something. Recognize this? - Is this the saddle from the feed store? It's gorgeous. - The same one. Try to stay on it this time? - Let's go, kiddo. Come on. - Let's do this. - You need help? - I got this. - Okay. - Fine. - Come on. What's up, bud? - Wonderful. It is nice to see you smile again. - Thank you, Ronald. We all believe in you. You're already a champion to all of us. - Thanks. - Now go kick their butts. - That's your cue. You ready? - Yep. - Let's do this. How you feeling? - Nervous. - Yeah? - Yes, very nervous. - I think she's gonna do great. - Of course. - Yeah. - She's got it. - Yeah, I mean, she's got to, right? - Has to. - Here goes nothing. - Here goes everything. She looks good. - It's all because of you. - You too. - She is a fast learner. - That Barbara girl riding Jericho is almost perfect. - Yeah. No matter what happens, you should be proud. - So should you. - Welcome all competitors to the Vermont Young Riders Championship Show.
