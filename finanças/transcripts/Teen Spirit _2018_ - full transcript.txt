Yeah, 'course. With Hayley and Kelli. - When is it? - Saturday. My boyfriend's gonna drive us. He has a BMW. It's really old. It's still a BMW. Hmm... Are you trying out, Violet?

I saw a few faces go then. As you well know, it's the first time we've come to the island. So it's really just a chance for you guys to show us what we've been missing all this time, yeah? Ultimately, only five of you will be invited back tomorrow to perform for Jules and the show's producers. Okay, any questions, please do speak to your team leaders. That's what they're here for. And other than that, good luck. Break a leg. - I know! - Oh, my gosh. It's like ten girls in one bathroom. I'm like, "Hello." Good! Let's start again. Five, six, energy! Hit it! Thanks. This is for you. You need to bring it when you come back tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah. Today's the audition for the audition, so to speak. There's another two stages before the final round. So, um, fill that in for me, we can send you on your way. - How old are you? - Seventeen. You need to bring a parent or guardian when you come back. It's company policy. Is there a way around that?

Yeah, he's my uncle. Um... You sign here and print your name. Mm-hmm. Vladimir Brajkovic? Yeah. My parents are huge fans of the opera and they love your uncle. Uh, Miss Valenski? Wish me luck. Luck has nothing to do with anything. Did you bring your own music with you? Yeah, I have an iPod. Right, just one thing, so you know, Jules might cut you off, ask for something else. 'Cause you prepared a couple of songs, yeah? - Yeah. - It's not personal. She does it to everyone, so... don't overthink it. All right. Your name? Violet. Your full name? Violet Valenski.

We were telling Violet that she has potential, but she has to work on her performance skills. Potential for what? What potential? We're going to invite Violet to remain in the competition. So she wins something, or what? No. She's through to the next round. She needs to practice. Work on her breathing. She's very green. I will make sure that she is ready. Okay, thank you! Yeah, if you both wanna follow me, we'll get you sorted. Hey, do we get any money for today? Or... Uh, you're a little bit of a way off that yet. - See you guys Saturday. - See you. - What? - Mother's gonna lose her shit. Don't worry, I'll talk to her. You're not meeting my mum. Hey, trust me. I'm good with people. Too good. So... what are your intentions with my daughter? - I think... - Vlad's helping me with my singing. Helping? How? I went to an audition today. For a singing competition. And I qualified for the next round. If I go through, I get to go to London. It would be on television. You like television. It could be a good thing for the both of us. What does he have to do with all this? I'm her manager. What are you talking about? Manager? Manager for what? Tell her I was an opera singer. I already did. She doesn't care. How are you going to do this and keep up with your responsibilities? School's out next week. I can still work nights and weekends. We don't have money to pay you. So what are you getting out of this? She does well in this competition, maybe she has a future. And I get 50 percent, yeah? Fifty percent? You get 15 percent. That's what manager gets. Not a penny more. And no monkey business. You lay a finger on my daughter and I will have you killed. I know people who can do terrible things. Understood. Are you sure? Sure. It was nice meeting you. Thank you for bringing my daughter home safely. Nice to meet you. Thank you for today. You know... your mother is very beautiful. I'll tell her you think so. Don't laugh. It's true. - Vlad. - Yes, Violet? Were you really an opera singer? Once upon a time. Oi, come on, don't be shy. - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh! Yo, Lisa told me the good news. Congratulations. That's... That's rather brilliant. That's really good. Thanks. Yo, my band's playing a g... a gig on, um... It's on Saturday. But we're... we're pretty shit. But... I think you... You'd probably...

Most of them are more experienced than you. When you're onstage, you are exposed. Your voice is important, yes. But it's your soul, your spirit, that people are seeing. You can do this.

We're gonna find out who they are - in three, two, one... - Three, two, one... Violet Valenski and Angel X, stay where you are. You could be going through to the grand final. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for them, in third place, The Extra-Terrestrials! Unlucky, lads. Okay, so, we're down to two. Violet Valenski and Angel X. Now, as you know, only one of them will make it through to that grand final at London ExCeL in August, in front of a global audience. But who is it gonna be? Well... we can find out. Because I now know what the judges have decided. Ladies and gentlemen... Your newest Teen Spirit finalist is... Angel X! Where are you going? Meet you in the car. You were great tonight. It was the wrong song. Should have done a ballad. It was the right song. You came second. Exactly. It was their mistake. We'll keep practicing. Next time we'll go to the finals.

Three months. - How do you two know each other? - School. - You know, just school. - Right. Oh, my God. I'm so shit. - Did I miss it? - No. I mean, yeah, you did miss it, but you didn't miss much. You were supposed to text me. Yeah. Sorry. Is that it? - Well, that's a good price. - Yeah. We should get out of here as soon as we can before she changes her mind. - Come on then. - Yeah? Scared to move her? Come on. Hey! What are you doing? That's my horse. - Not anymore. - What? - My brother paid for it already. - What? - Paid who? - I don't know her name. The, uh, the lady. - Wait. - No, we have to go. Please, wait! Go on, hurry up then. Don't touch me! Is this you? This was me. I have no idea what you're saying. But it sounds good. Well, Pinkerton is American naval officer. Played by you? Played by me. His child bride has a son in his absence. When he returns home, he has new wife. The child bride is devastated. He realizes he has made a terrible mistake, but he's too much of a coward to face her. Does she forgive him? No. She kills herself. Depressing. Ah, it's opera. When I was little, I caught my mum with someone. I didn't know him. And I never told my dad. But I didn't have to. A week later, he was gone. No note, no good-bye, nothing. A house is expensive to keep. Things break all the time. There's land, and animals, and... She refuses to leave... because she thinks he's coming back. He's not coming back. I know that now. Sorry about the other night. It's okay. You were disappointed. But I'm not going to let you give up. I wasted my own talent. Maybe you're my second chance to... be useful now. Well, that's good. Because I've got some news. You're wasting your time, we can't pay you. Yes, this is Violet. They made a mistake. The girl who won my group... she was using a fake name. Turns out she'd already entered another competition before. She's been disqualified. We're going to London, Vlad. Going to the finals. Wow. Here we are on the Isle of Wight, a small but picturesque island off the coast of England. And behind me, the home of Violet Valenski, the first contestant from the island to make the Teen Spirit finals. I never dreamed I would make it this far. I keep waiting for them to call back and say there's been a mistake. The competition, which provides a platform for young British talent, has surged in popularity thanks to high-profile contestants like Keyan Spears and Three Two Tango. Violet, who lives alone with her mother, has no expectations of the same success, but looks forward to performing on a global stage. I know I'm not the best singer in England, but I'm gonna try to work really hard to be a better one by the time we get to London. And forgive the question, but we have to ask, is there a special someone in your life? No special someone. I don't believe in love.

I'm not paying for it. Who is then? My mum's paying for it. May the Lord be with you. And with thy spirit. Thanks be to God. Before you go, this is a special occasion. For one of our angels has been blessed with a gift. May her faith and spirit give her the strength to overcome temptation, and lead her on the path to prosperity. - Amen. - Amen. - Hey. - Hey. - You didn't have to do that. - It's not for you. Ma, Vlad's here. It's for you. That's very... unexpected. A woman like you should get flowers every day. It's still 15 percent. All right... We should hit the road. Should I help with your bags? They... They're, um... They're upstairs. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Yeah. I got you something. So I know you're safe. There's some credit on it. It will be cheaper than using the phone at the hotel. I'll call as soon as I get there. Good. We are going for four days. There's this train in London, the Eurostar, it goes from London to Paris direct. Ah... Paris is expensive. Not if we make our millions. Your daughter's there, no? You should visit her after the finals. Miss Valenski. - Hi. - Welcome to London. My name is Yuriy. I'll be taking care of you over the next few days. This is Vlad. Hey, I'm manager. Vlad, a pleasure. That's our band, Louise, Luke, Rollo. The band will have to check in on the lower level. Sam will show you. Okay, bye. Luke. Luke, you are in charge, yeah? - Nothing from the minibar. - Yeah, okay. - Hey, I'll be checking, yeah. - Yes, okay. Violet, Vlad, if you'd like to follow me. This room's for me? Yes, of course. Mr. Brajkovic, we have you right next door. Good. This is your itinerary for the weekend. You have about 30 minutes and then I will meet on the conference room on level B. I can take it. Very good. I'll let you get settled and meet you downstairs. Thank you. Mm. You have to do a television promo. What for? For the broadcast on Sunday. Everybody has to do it. It's nothing, just say your name and, uh... where you are from, or... What do you want to wear? I'll wear this. Hey, we're The Shades. Vote for us tomorrow on Teen Spirit. Hi, I'm Thomas King. Vote for me tomorrow on Teen Spirit. Hi, I'm Violet, and you can vote for me tomorrow night on Teen Spirit. Hi, we're Peckham Rose. Vote for us tomorrow on Teen Spirit. I'm Roxy. You can vote for me tomorrow night on Teen Spirit. Holy shit, this is massive. Yeah. Oi, it's that foxy Roxy. - Yeah. - Yeah, she's fit. Nah. No, she's not my type. - What? - Shut up. - And a side of chips. - Told ya. He's not good enough for you. Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you. That doesn't make you any less strong. To have somebody care about ya. I know that you care. I just want you to care less. Ever since Mum's died all you've been doing is just taking it out on me. You're gonna set me off now. That was quick. Hmm, housekeeper. Hmm. They came already. I know I'm not the perfect dad... Uh... Can I help you? Everybody seems to have no clothes on at all. Why is it that all of the stories you tell me... I know. I have absolutely no... Ooh, hang on. This one... This one is for later. Hi, hi! Uh, Alexa's being an idiot. Ignore her. Everyone... this is Violet. - And, uh, Mr... - Brajkovic. Jules. Hi. - Everything is okay? - Mm. Please take a seat. Mm, go on. This is Marcus. He's on the board committee. He's very posh, so we have to be nice to him. Is something wrong? No, on the contrary. We have an opportunity that, uh, I think might appeal. What kind of opportunity? We would like to offer Violet a contract ahead of tomorrow's performance. A record contract. No guarantees, of course, but you would have studio time and you'd be working with songwriters and... you would have an incredible management team behind you. Oh, Violet, this is Keyan. Obviously he's a total miscreant, but he can vouch for us. They're amazing. Piss off. No, really, I... It's been great. She has a manager already. She doesn't need two. Well, as you know, there is occasional precedent of the final winner getting an opportunity like this. But we wanted to come to you now, ahead of tomorrow's performance. Why me? 'Cause you're a caterpillar. We're a cocoon. Maybe, together, we make a butterfly. Or maybe not. We wanna give it a shot. And this way, you have a safety net, no matter what happens. That way, you can go out tomorrow and relax. Just sing without all the... presh. And what if she wins and somebody else makes an offer? Better offer. Well, then that would be great. I'd be very happy for you. Hmm. She's not signing anything until I've read it. - Vlad. - Look, take the night to think about it. But you have to sign before the show or it's a no-go. That's the deal. Thank you for thinking of me. Sounds really exciting. Well, good. It is exciting. What's your name again? Brajkovic. Vladimir Brajkovic. Right, of course it is. He seems nice. He is. Does he know what he's doing? He's not a real manager or anything, but he has done a lot for me. We can do a lot more. Five, six, seven, eight. So, lift over, up. Taking your head over and around. Back, side, and to side, side. And then we'll move into the lift. - What do you reckon? - Sorry. Um... Yeah, I'm sorry, this... It's just a little... Um... Awkward? Yeah. Okay, what about something a bit more simple? So... we are on opposite sides of the stage... and then we walk to one another. Then meet in the center. Then we lean in... And I lean in like I'm... I'm gonna kiss her. And just as I get to here, the rest of the contestants enter and they break the moment. Um, and what about the lift? Maybe cut the lift. Okay. Great. And then, for the end show, try this jacket. Um... Pink looks so good on you, so... I think the tones are gonna be great. And then the skirt. You know, if you sign this, you are signing me out of your life. Stop being dramatic. I'm not. Have you read it? Huh? It's bad contract. You sign away everything. Keyan signed it. He's doing all right, if you ask me. Yeah, yeah. Shouldn't be going out. Should be resting your voice. You're the one that told me to be more social. Da, but not the night before the show. I'll just go for an hour. What do you think? Good. Too much makeup. They said I might be able to keep the shoes. Don't look so worried. I'm not even leaving the hotel. Uh, maybe I should come with you, huh? No. That's weird. - You have your phone? - Mm-hmm. No drinks. Hey, you too.

He's upset, understandably, but I spoke to him and he's agreed not to make a fuss. Thank you. Vlad just gets a little drunk sometimes. He's a teddy bear, really. Oh. No, of course. Look, who you make friends with, it's none of my business. My business is making sure that talented people like you get what they want. How do you know what I want? I don't. You're right. You tell me. Why did you enter this competition? I like to sing. Well, yes. Well, a lot of people like to sing. You can sing. But the reality is... you're an inexperienced performer with a Polish name and a posh accent, entering a competition that relies on the public vote. Now... let's imagine, just hypothetically, you pull off a win. Well, then what? Hmm? What's the best-case scenario in that outcome? - I get a record deal. - You get a record deal. You've already won. All you need to do is sign. You know... life comes down to these moments, Violet. Don't take them for granted. Oh... I nearly forgot. I found your necklace. Ten-minute warning. If you see Vlad...
