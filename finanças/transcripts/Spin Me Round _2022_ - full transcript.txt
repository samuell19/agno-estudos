Anyway, look, guys, now, a while back, I heard there was a program that Tuscan Grove sponsored where they take all the top managers from franchises all over the country on a all-expense paid trip to the Tuscan Grove Institute in Italy. Uh, you learn about Italian cuisine and culture. Uh, you stay in a villa. It's a opportunity of a lifetime. Now, Amber, you've been here for nine years. Matter of fact, I hope she's here for nine more years. Yeah... You've shown grace under pressure. You've ran this place like a perfectly run ship. Amber... pack your bags. You're going to Italy next month. What?! Congratulations. Wha-- I -- Are you being serious? Oh, my God! I mean, I've never been to Europe before or anything. Paul, I'm -- I'm so grateful to you for this, really. Hey, look, this is an honor. Like, this is not an easy program to get into. Matter of fact, I had to write you a two-page essay. That's how much I believe in you. But seriously, get out of Bakersfield. Go have some fun. Recharge, relax. Have a little adventure. And, look, don't worry about us here. We'll manage.

We're gonna have a lot of fun here -- eat a lot of great food, learn about Italian culture, and most importantly, grow as people. But first, everyone introduce yourselves. Tell us your name, where you're from, and a fun fact about yourself. Okay, that's dry. I'll start. I'm Craig. I, uh, come from [Italian accent] Cincinnati, Ohio. [ Normal voice ] But, uh, I've been living that ex-pat life for eight years. And, uh, let's see -- my -- my great uncle invented skorts. "Sports"? Skorts. Okay. Um, my name's Fran, and you all probably recognize me from "Chef's Challenge." And, uh -- Well, anyways, I think of myself as more than just a manager. I guess I'm a bit of a foodie. I've been dabbling in molecular gastronomy and, I don't know, just happy to be here to share my expertise with y'all. Oh. Um, I'm Dana, and, um, I've loved Tuscan Grove since I was a kid. And I guess you could say that Nick Martucci's kind of my idol. Just the way he, um -- he built this business from scratch. And he stars in those beautiful commercials. Um, I don't know -- I-I'm just really psyched to be here. I don't know. I don't know. I'm Jen. Uh, I'm from Oakland, California, and I am very -- Dana: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I forgot. I'm from Tenafly, New Jersey. Please continue. Did you -- Sorry, no, no. You can go. Um, I am really over the moon to be here. I feel very connected to all of you guys already, like, in this cosmic way. Like we met in a past life or something, and that's, like, very exciting. And -- Oh, fun fact about me is, I used to be a twin. Uh, almost, because my sister died in utero. Cool. That's not really a fun fact, but, okay. Hi, everybody. My name is Deb. I lost my bags at the airport, and I had all these really important things in my suitcase. I called this woman with the airlines and I spoke to her, and she was very rude to me. And she has no idea when I'm gonna get my bags back, or if they'll ever find them again. So, I just feel like I'm not being very fun. Mm. But, um, I really appreciated Amber. She was so kind, and you told me that you could lend me clothes, and I really appreciate that. You seem like a nice person. Thank you. W-W-Well, I'm Amber. I'm from Bakersfield, California. Um, this is my first time traveling outside the U.S. I've worked at Tuscan Grove for nine years. I technically took a year off to open a restaurant, um, with tablets at every table, but my ex put all the debt on my credit cards and killed my credit, and it went under, so I'm back. And... now I'm here. Alright. Well, okay -- Okay, so I'm Susie. Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. Um, I'm from San Antonio, Texas, so, "Go, Spurs." Um, yeah, I don't know -- I've been at Tuscan Grove for, like, ever -- since I was a little kid, like, I've been working there. I mean, not, like, for real-for real. Just for fun. It's not like child labor. Um, but, like, my parents and my, like, aunt and uncle, they all have a franchise, and they've had it forever. So, it's like all of us work there -- my cousins -- There's 23 of us, like, all together. We're just, like, a big family, but we're all, like, really close. They're, like, my best friends. Oh, I love family. Yeah, no, I mean, family rips. Craig: Great. So, now that we got the fun stuff out of the way, I gotta -- I have to put on my serious hat. Italy's a magnificent country, but, uh, it can also be dangerous. That's why we have a strict curfew. How is Italy dangerous, Craig? Uh, well, you know, there's a lot of unpaved roads here, so you could slip and fall. You could, uh -- You could get lost. There are boars. Boars? Yeah. There's no leaving the TG Institute while you're here, except for official field trips, which are so fun.

What is the different between a ragu and a Bolognese? You don't have to raise your hand. Sorry, um, a Bolognese is from Bologne? Yes. What else? What else? Ingredients? Yes, but, uh, specifically. Sauce? Well, you're gonna use a red wine for ragu and white wine... Uh, and white wine for Bolognese. ...for Bolognese. Deb: That's so interesting. Ooh, I love this. This is fun. Would that look cute? Yeah, you can take it -- sure. I think it would be so cute with my jeans, you know? Mm-hmm. Oh, and there's some sweats to sleep in, if you want. Thank you so much. I really like you, Amber. Yeah. So, do you have a boyfriend back home? No, definitely not. Oh, that's okay. You're still young, you know? You got plenty of time. You should just have fun while you're here and sow your wild oats, 'cause that's what I'm gonna do. But I'm actually married, though. Oh. My husband, Hank, is wonderful. He's -- He's really good for me. We actually have a really good relationship -- very solid. You're gonna find love, Amber. I can feel it. A lot of my friends say I'm really intuitive.

Hey, do you have everything you need? Oh, yeah. This is so cute. My husband actually loves when I wear really revealing and sexy stuff. Not that I would ever do anything while I'm here, but, you know... Uh, d-d-d-do you need anything else? 'Cause I'm just gonna talk to my friend right now. No, it's fine. Oh. It's actually really good for my self-esteem, though, because I love getting attention from men, and it's like that kind of sexual energy, flirty -- Just makes my body feel good. And then you kind of, like, bring that energy back to the marriage. So it's -- it's, like, healthy. Totally. S-Sorry, so, it's just that my friend is calling long-distance. Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah, okay.

And, like, then she drove me back here afterwards, and they both told me not to tell anybody. But, like, Kat is kinda sketchy. Like, she and Nick have a super volatile relationship. Like, she kind of hates him. You spent the day on Nick's yacht, just the two of you? Y-Yeah, and -- and what I'm saying is... Wow. Yeah. ...Kat... Yeah, yeah, that's fun. A boat day, that's cool.

I'm celibate now. Look, baby turtle, meeting you genuinely opened me up. I can't believe you came all this way to tell me that. I really needed to see you again. That's wild.
