MEGABOX PLUSM Presents Executive Producer KIM Jong-baek IM Jun-sik Financing Executive KIM Do-yeon Produced By JOUNG You-dong - Did you get it? - Yup. So pretty! And yellow too. When I grow up, I want to marry you. Really? Can you promise me that? Yup! Promise! Promise! When you grow up and like another boy, daddy's gonna cry and cry. I will never like other boys, I'll marry you. Really? You promised! I must be getting old, I can't stop crying... My darling Do-yeon. My little baby. Come on! What is it? I told you not to wash my undies with dad's! Look at you, what's wrong with that? It just feels weird. How come? You don't like mixing our laundry? Should a family divide the laundry load? She wants more lip stains from your company. Yeah? But why are you telling me that? You don't even want to talk to me? Never mind, I don't need it. Won Do-yeon! Honey, come sit down. Give it up already. What do you always do in the basement? Nothing much, of course. Yo, Do-rag! Did you hear our boys' new single? It's dope, dopest dope. I told you, it's crap, worthless crap. - No, it isn't. - The dance... The dance is all weird. - Like they're swimming. - You look like a monkey. It hurts so much. Are you okay? That looked painful. So embarrassing. That was so uncool... Do-yeon! Aren't you Do-yeon? No... Yes. I heard you sing well, Jin-young told me. There's an audition next Monday, can you come? I'll think about it. Okay, see you next week. You know what? Others may laugh at me, but he's my destiny. What destiny? Who was that? Why do you always frown and don't talk to me? What is he saying? You don't like talking to your dad now? You're into boys rather than books? Dad collapsed, I'll go first, bring Do-yeon. Even at that state, I heard everything clearly. ''He must be moved to a general hospital!'' ''His artery must be unclogged, or he'll die!'' Then the doctors came to me, and they were punching my chest over and over again! That wasn't punching, father. CPR, it's chest compression. I was pissed off and unclogged my own artery! So they weren't beating me up? You were lucky. I'm gonna sleepover and monitor him. Can you take her and head home? - Is that okay? - Yeah. Won Do-yeon! What's with your face all night? It's nothing. Are you dating? Date? With that biker gang? Give me your phone. Seriously... - Do-yeon! - Sweetie! Do-yeon, what's your problem? Let's hear it out. Sweetie. I'm doing everything for you. I just want you to study, is that so hard? Get into college. You can date all you want. When I was your age, I was never without a dictionary. Know what happened to guys who dated in high school? Not again. I'm talking to you. Take that off! Do-yeon. Do you know what my life outside home is like? I wish you'd live a day in my shoes... Me too. I wish you'd do the same too. If you live my life, you wouldn't' say it's easy. Just study? You have no idea. You try it, see if it's possible! I'm not done with you! I'm sick of it, stop treating me like a kid! How dare you lash out at me! Are you done fighting? You know, this gingko tree is over a century old. According to a legend, if you pray under here, it'll grant you a... Who was I talking to? - Stupid idiot... - Dad, up ahead! Excuse me, where... Are you Won Sang-tae from #607? You can't walk around yet. Mr. Won? What's with her? Dad? Do-yeon? DADDY YOU, DAUGHTER ME I had this much white hair? What are you doing?! Dad, this is a dream. It has to be, right? Optical illusion or a mirage? Dad, pinch my cheek. It hurts! You too! No, this won't work. This is a hospital, let's get a doctor. I don't even believe this, why'd a doctor? We'll be sent to the psych ward. Then what? We need a solution! I got it, I got it! I'll take Dongbu Express. No frigging way! There'll be traffic on Dongbu, take the Hanchun Road. Then after Hwikyung precinct, there's White House Club. Maybe there's construction. Don't smoke in the car, we got a kid back here. Right at White House Club, stop at the Jeil Pharmacy. This is a dream. It has to be. We'll figure this out at the hospital. Psychiatric Hospital Right? I knew it, they were mental cases. Psychiatrist Jung Byung-jin Byung-jin! Is that bastard sleeping on the job again? Yes? Byung-jin, I'm so screwed. I'm not Do-yeon, I'm Sang-tae. Stop laughing, you prick! I know it's hard to believe, but you have to. I'm Sang-tae, buddy! Do-yeon, does your head hurt? Sang-tae, what's with her? Sir, I'm Do-yeon. Kangsan High, 31st year, Jung Byung-jin. We were desk partners for 3 years. We were Itaewon club regulars. Nonsan military base, I was #87, you were #127. Do I have to mention the double circumcision? Byung-jin, it's me! Sang-tae! Won Sang-tae! Are you messing with me because you got the beer tab? Look at me! Stop! This is crazy. - Nurse! Come in! - Yes, sir! Send them away! Get them out. Hey! You can't do this to me! The 20-year old gold digger! You went berserk wanting to marry her, I was the one who found out about her! - Come out please! - Let me go! Whenever you see Nurse Kim, you said she reminded you of the female gargoyle, and you'll let her go when you remodel this place! You told your kid all that? Don't hit my daughter! Fight outside! I don't believe this! How much? Kiddo, what do you think you're doing? You wanna see me lose my shop? I really need a drink right about now. Absolutely not. Fine, buy this for me. Dad, what are you doing? Don't drink in my body! Dad? But it's my body right now. I don't frigging believe this. Oh, you don't? This family is messed up. What will you become when you grow up? Respect your parent. Do you know me? Who are you to bitch about my family? ''Bitch about''? How dare you raise your voice at me! - Dad, let's leave. - Don't get pissy in front of a kid. My body isn't mine, her body is mine and I'm in her body. So I'm her! Whether you're in his body, and he's in yours, who cares! I'm only looking out for myself! You crazies are ruining my day! Get out! Stupid nutjobs! She needs parenting! Your head's even busted! Get out! Get out! He's back again? Get out! Leave! Leave! Out! Did I do well? I'll be back. Get out! Do-yeon, we should keep this a secret to your mom, right? Gotta restore your health. Eat lots of beef. My baby eats so well, another one. There you go. I'm so glad you discharged without any problems. I was so worried sick. Wait a minute, I don't need to diet. Nice! Eat plenty. Wasn't Do-yeon on a diet? Don't say that, she's eating so well. I feel like drinking, wanna have a beer? Here, honey! Cheers! You're always drinking! I hate that about you! Do-yeon? What's with you? So cringey! I don't care, everything's annoying! Wait a minute. I wasn't gonna say anything... but you two don't normally talk. Be honest now. Did you pay her off? How much? Come on! How much? What the heck? I'm practically blind The audition's on Monday 4PM, practice room, see you then! Ji-oh wants to see me! Baby. I think I drank too much. I feel so hot. Yeah? Then take some cold medicine. No need. No way! It's unthinkable! This cannot happen! Mom! Dear Lord, I'll be good. I won't lie about buying a textbook to get make-up. I won't talk so forward to my friends. So please, give me back my body! How to switch back bodies Dad! I got school tomorrow, what do we do?! I'm sure there's a way. What way? What if this is permanent? It's your fault! Why is this my fault? Why is everything my fault? Forget it. Let's think this through. Let's think. Something we ate at grandpa's? Then what about mom and grandpa? The car accident? The gingko tree? Grandpa mentioned it! That's it! Let's call and ask. Sang-tae, how are you? Father, it's your son-in-law. Is that you, Do-yeon? Yes, gramps. Gingko tree? That gingko tree... There's a legend that souls can be swapped if you pray under it. And then? What do we do? Well... it's... One, two, three... four, five, six, seven! 7 days! Back to normal in a week! But don't ever fight, dire consequences then! Go! I'm always go! Father! Hello? Should we believe him? What a mess. Go to my work. Work, school, mom, they all must be kept up. Okay. What about the audition... The Revolution presentation on Friday... Do-yeon, let's make up and get along, okay? Fine. Good. Hey, it's switched. What are you doing? Come on! What are you doing? Cover it up when going up the stairs! You're exposed from the bottom! Then why wear such a short skirt? Do you want your daughter to look like a midget? But the undies are visible! Kids nowadays... Dang. When talking to my friends, use short phrases. Add AF at the end to emphasize. ''She's hot AF!'' ''LOL! STFU!'' Okay? You should be using proper language. Abbreviating everything is damaging our language. Jesus, dad, you'll become a loner. If you don't get something, be quiet and just react. If they're laughing or frowning, do the same. Remember my BF Jin-young? Don't ever follow her to the audition today, okay? You can't act like yourself at the office. Think before you speak! Actually, don't speak. So I should STFU? STFU? Don't use stuff like that. If a colleague asks, say ''Sounds good, proceed.'' If a boss orders, say ''I'll do my best.'' And this is important, don't ever say ''I'll take responsibility.'' Always ''I'll do my best.'' Got it? Yup. I wrote all important notes, so call me if you're not sure. We gotta swap phones too? Does a phone like that suits you? You'll be treated like a pervert. Indeed. Don't check my messages. I know if you checked it, understand? If you send weird messages to Ji-oh, I'm gonna kill myself! How could you say that? Fine, give it! Daughters are useless. Alright, I did it once before, it can't be that hard. Let's do this. Is dad in a high position? Dang it. Too good to be true. Can't believe I'm a student again. She looks like a nerd type. Hi! Ahn Kyung-mi Kyung-mi ... Studying hard? Good to meet you! Continue. I should too. Hey! Why are you sitting here? You want to study? Goosebumps! I'm going to a cottage with my boyfriend. I told mom you and I are going. So if she ever calls, that's the story. If you ever go on a trip with Ji-oh, - you can count on me... - Scums of society! Go where? Whatever, you snake. Forget it, don't do it then. Ji-oh? Bastard... Let's take a look at this prick. Stock Liquidation Team Eh? This can't be my office. Is this an office or a storage? Is that so? But I told Mr. Park on the way in... Where is dad's cubicle? When I'm there next week... Are you spying on us to make sure we're working? This is so morally wrong. I honestly do all the work! Am I right? But... what did I... Give me the invoice. I'm still working on it. That's Ju... Assistant Manager Ju: National Quiz Show champion Irritating but responsible Choi Hee-jin Lee Sang-min She's really fit. Assistant Manager Nah: Competent and kind Yes, I understand. Gianna Jeon doppelganger Dang. Good morning, Mr. Won. Alright, let's get lunch! Dad's really unpopular. Look at him, dressed like a gay, how dare he go after my kid? I'm so much hotter. Okay! Thank you. Hello. I actually can't sing, I came here because I love Ji-oh. Remember my name, I'm Choi Min-ji! I love you! Do-rag, you nervous? You used to listen to his music, are you excited about this? She did? Next up is, Won Do-yeon. I sang at the Youth Music Contest. Band Club Audition To look kind, doing everything possible. To look splendid, doing everything possible. Watching the TV, turning on the radio, always looking crooked, cannot see and cannot hear. Just the way it is, crooked as ever! Crooked, crooked, crook, crooked, crook, crooked! Crooked, crooked! The ground he's standing on is crooked. You sing really well. I like this song too. He's got a weird taste. Lemon, olive oil, Alaska, and glacial milk extracts... Any questions, Mr. Won? What? Pardon? Sir, you have to focus, please concentrate, okay? You wanted to present at the Revolution meeting! Honestly, this department wouldn't run without me. Our former quiz contestant is doing great work. I was first place. First place. Next up are model candidates. Celebrities? Could you zoom in? I'm sorry. Kim Joo-hyuk Damn, he's so old! Get a celeb model that teenage girls like. Sir, take a look, check out his face. Study his features carefully. You said he's a good friend of the chairman, so you recommended him. Oh, I did? Actually, I was hoping to change the model too. Why don't we update the list and continue the presentation? Shall we? We totally should. Sounds great, proceed please. Okay. Hee-jin, what time is it? Almost time to clock out. Then tonight! Sir, you have to treat him well to seal our deal with them. Good luck! Dang, company dinner? Who's this Kwon? Keep going! A full circle! Already a full circle? Who's this creep? There goes the mood. You shoulda went home if you weren't gonna drink. Mr. Won, why don't you sing us a song? - I'm the best singer... - No! No! The mood killer should sing. Go sing! If you score over 95, I'll sign the deal right here! Mr. Won? 95? Just go with it. Wait a minute How come there's only 2 raspberry wines? Well, I think they're squeezing more berries now! I eat alone, watch a movie alone, singing alone, and I cry and cry. You're gone, regrets are useless. Alone again today. I walk alone, watch TV alone, I get drunk alone, cry and cry like this everyday. Love was sweet, under the shade of breakup, I can't fall asleep again tonight. A karaoke regular? Mr. Kwon, it's a done deal then! I love it when girls pour drinks.. Let me pour you another. Here. More, more! Are you trying to kill me? So sweet, too sweet! You are so generous. I am? Thank you. Your body is so generous! Chicks nowadays, they're too uptight. If they don't like a joke, they scream sexual harassment. I can't even talk! So I asked a female employee, ''Do your big boobs cause back pains?'' Then she went batshit crazy! I was genuinely worried as her boss, and was looking out for her well-being! Right? Right? Of course. Right! It's all about communication, isn't that right? Ms. Nah, how's your back? Mr. Kwon, I think you're drunk... ''Do your big boobs cause back pains?'' Then she... Mr. Won, what are you doing? Oh, this? I wanted a memento of our communication, so I uploaded a video to social networks. It's a heartless world out there, I hope it gets a lot of views. Mr. Kwon's communication with human touch, isn't it great? It's not sexual harassment. Give it a Like everyone, you too, Mr. Kwon. My body aches moving so little. Daddy! What the heck? Why is this bag so raggedy? So many wrinkles. Dad's getting old. What took you so long? Did you cause any problems? No way. No problems. I had company dinner. Company dinner? Jin-young: U were the bomb. Ji-oh's taste is so old. What?! Nah: You really could dance! You went to the audition? I told you not to! And you?! What dance! You danced tonight? I showed them what I got. What happened at the audition? Isn't it obvious? I bombed. You must dance really well. That's my girl. Thanks for the audition, dad. We have to get along. We mustn't fight. Mr. Won, new style! Morning! You don't even call ahead? You're late! General manager wants you. General manager? Mr. Won, you wanted to sever ties with our client? If you can't take a joke, how will you maintain your job? I won't do business with a pervert. Are we in school? Making friends? It was a done deal, was it so hard to wrap it? Watching my employee get sexually harassed... Mind your damn business and do business. This is why he can't climb the ladder. Aren't you worried about your kid's college tuition? Delete this video and go apologize! Go away. My portfolio's down again. Kim said this was a good stock. Hey. Can't you pretend to study today? Tomorrow's mock exam. Mock exam?! Teacher! Teacher! Sit down, please! The bell, Jesus. When a + 1 is multiplied by n, you know this formula. Sn = n(a+1 ) / 2... Class nerd, you're my best shot. Let's study at my place together. Just once... Just once! Before you die, I wish you'd study just once! Study! What a punk ass. Bean paste soup and egg rolls. Okay. Okay, good. I'm really okay. You got scolded because of me. Allow me to buy you a drink. How about it? Just one drink. Okay! Evening! Cheers! At our last company dinner, thank you for avenging me. I was actually really irritated. It had to be done. Holy cow! Where did you get your gel nails done? - This? - Yeah. I followed online instruction. You got talent. Really? I want to do it too, they're so pretty. Here's bean paste soup! - Looks so good! - Thank you! Bust out the kimchi in the fridge. Please? Get it yourself! Have a great meal. Instead of theater, we went to a private booth, and he was trying to make out, so unromantic. We're going to the cottage anyway. I'm not listening... He's so reckless. I'm not listening, I can't hear her. It's too tight, I'm taking my bra off. Bra? No! Never! Not in this house! You can't! What's with you? Are you high? Damn, it's dad. He's got a thing for killing my drive. Even when I'm studying at friend's, he texts and calls. Like he's spying me, so annoying. Why is that annoying? A parent should worry if you're late! It's a scary world out there! Do-rag, you scare me the most. What's with you? My parents wouldn't know I'm not home. That's because you're always a model student. With a daughter like you, I wouldn't worry so much. It's the opposite, they're utterly uninterested. I have to pretend to study to get any attention. I'm still their daughter. Are you nuts? Really? How much did you spend? I'm buying clothes with my own money! Hello! So hot. Really hot. Let's talk about that later, I have to go to dad's for a few days. Sure, do that. Go ahead, see you. You're worthless. What's all this? Come with me. What did you buy? How much was that? Why did you bring my friends over? To study, mock exam's tomorrow. We'll pull an all-nighter. That'll make a difference? Of course, it will. I used to study really well. I'll show you what studying is like. I support you in every way so you can concentrate. Studying is so easy. So easy, too easy. Alright, go on and try it. Okay. I'll prove to you how easy studying is. Begin. Eyes on the exam! Hand them in. Huh? I was only on question 1. 2nd period: 100 minutes When a black dog and a white dog mate, there's 25% chance of gray offspring. If there's 20% chance of white offspring when a gray dog and a yellow dog mate, what is the chance of a yellow offspring when a gray dog and a white dog mate? Up to the dog. I miss Ji-oh... Come to the helipad, please. What? What? What? I got a lot of complaint too! I'm holding myself back! What did you do with Ms. Nah last night? Life consulting. She normally talked shit about you. But the way she looks at you changed lately. Why is that? She talked shit? That's not even half of it. She spitted in your coffee every morning! Mr. Won. How did you become so close to Ms. Nah? Tell me your secret! She's driving me nuts. When I smell her... even her scent makes my heart beat faster. I don't know what to do, I read romance guidebooks. You know me, if I know the problem, I can find the answer. Give me your phone. Look at this, you're a buffoon. buffoon: socially retarded Are you a weather man? Why only talk about weather? It takes me 30 minutes to write one of these. I smell cheese. Cheese? Do I smell? It's so cheesy. You get rejected 100%. Look at this. ''When the wind blows, my heart flutters for you.'' What is this?! It stinks of old man! Then, what do I do? Watch this. How do you type so fast? I got a crash course from my daughter. Ju: So stylish today! My type! What is that? Ji-oh: Meet at 5 tmr? Wanna take you somewhere. What's this prick saying? I should delete this... Welcome home. The exam? Did you do well? Yeah, you know. I'll know when the score's out. Should I make you some ramen? I'm fine. Ju: Thank you for today! You're the best! What did you do? He's kissing my butt. Mr. Ju? I helped him out with his relationship mess. OMG! OMFG! Ji-oh wants to meet at 5 tomorrow! I should've deleted it. No way. How can I go on your date? Think of it as... after school hobby. That doesn't make any sense. And that Ji-oh or whatever, I don't like him. Who cares about you. Ji-oh is... my destiny. Dang. Do-rag, your reality check is 404. Dang. You're a real high schooler now. Mr. Ju, stop horsing around. Stock Liquidation team. Oh, yes, yes! Yes, I understand. Okay! Mr. Won? The Marketing team will have a segment on a home shopping show. They'll be giving away our lip stain samples! Aren't you happy? This is a rare opportunity, sir. Come on, get ready. Yes, sir, I'll get the boxes. Home shopping? October Mock Exam Ranking 29 - Won Do-yeon I better keep this a secret from her. Dang, your rank went down. 26 - Bae Jin-young I went up by 3. 30 - Ahn Kyung-mi Dead last? Kyung-mi? What's wrong? Messed up the answers? Are you making fun of me? I'm always dead last! I'm so useless! It's okay, you gave it 1 10%. Honestly, you can't possibly study any harder Kyung-mi, don't study. Maybe it's not your thing. What's the point of studying? All life paths lead to fried chicken shop. Humanities, admin major, big corporation, chicken shop. Science, engineering major, big corporation, chicken shop. So I'm gonna do whatever I want, and take over dad's chicken shop. Yeah, you're so right. You're so pretty! I saw you on TV. We're all set. Okay. We got a big problem, huge problem. The Marketing team got into an accident. What do we do? Indeed. Good afternoon, hello. We're ready to start, who will go on the air? We are from Shangpree, but we're here just for the freebies. It doesn't matter, we just need one of you. - We're ready. - Got it. Here we go. 2 minutes, get ready! Ms. Nah, wait, wait, wait. I got a camera phobia. You were on that quiz show, you're good to go. I can't do it! It was a radio show! My legs are trembling! This is a rare opportunity. Containing 26 years of Shangpree's legacy, if you purchase Premium Moisture Mask set, you get another set for free! The entire package is worth $39.99. But is that all? No, we got freebies. The essentials of youths, lip stains 6-set. We have someone from Shangpree. Good afternoon. Hello. Huh? Why's he there? Lip stain's greatest strength is the color looks like it's your natural lips. Sir, what happened was, Marketing team had an accident on the way. #1 Vivid Red, #2... Azalea Coral, #3 Barbie Hot Pink, #4 Naked Pink. And #5 Tropical Orange. This was here? #6 Sweet Peach. This is a rare item, you know that, right? The high school girls go crazy over lip stains. Moisture masks for mothers, and gift these to your girls, they'll love you! Telling the girls to study isn't parenting. Just put one of these on their desks. This is show of love. It's begging for a kiss! Isn't it? Vivid color looks so nice! Is that right? Won Do-yeon. You usually ranked in the middle, what happened to the mock exam? Was it because of Kyung-mi? Not at all! She's doing her best! I'm sorry, sir. I deserve to die. I'll readily accept any punishment! No one deserves to die, what's with you? I should call your father. No way! Move your hand. Then with this. You can't, sir! Hold onto that tight. Hello, Mr. Won? I'm Do-yeon's homeroom teacher. Please hit me! Hit me hard! Do-yeon's grades went down! What? You're coming here? No way! Don't come! So you ruined the exam? I'll use this as a leverage to go on the date. Mr. Won, it was amazing. It was the first time we sold out due to freebies Please come again! Sure! Ju, I'm off! Yes, yes! Where you going? Sir. I did everything you told me to, and she swore at me. It's your fault, I can't even send weather texts now. Ju, if you never show your cards, no one wins. You must express yourself. No girls can resist someone saying ''I like you,'' not one. You sure about this? You have absolutely nothing to lose. If you're so nervous, feed her something sweet. Okay? Good luck! What's this? Chocolate. I don't like sweets. Well, Ms. Nah. I... I've been watching you. I think I'm really into you. Can we go on a date? Let's give it a try... Some guys just don't have it. You're making me nervous. Sit down. Why! Why! Why! Why! Sir, please calm down. I'm sorry about that. This is due to my lack of parenting. Why! Why! Why! Why! Mr. Won, calm down. Her grade dropped suddenly, but she's always cheerful... Why does that matter? You said ''Happiness comes from wealth, beauty and score.'' ''If you're poor and ugly, stick with books.'' What? Do-yeon told me that. I'm too embarrassed to be her father anymore. Studying is easy! Studying is a student's only responsibility! I feed you, clothe you, give you allowance! You just have to study, why's that so hard? Your exact words! Stop it, that's enough. Stop what? You can't even do it yourself now? Is that it? Is it? Happiness isn't ranked by grades! Dad! Dad! Where you going? ''Dad''? Dad! Stop! Dad! - Stop it! - Dad! You brat! Put me down! Seriously... Sit! Hey! You're giddy, aren't you? You were so excited to hit me! Feels vindicated to see me fail?! Why should I? It's my grade! I'm sorry. I'm so ashamed. No, dad. I think I went overboard, I'm sorry. I felt something while going to your work. We can't all place first. At least you tried your best. Isn't that enough? Sure. So, dad. Go on the date for me. It's almost time! - Hurry up! Come on! - Hey! - There's no time! - I can't go on your date! No way! I'd look fat in that. This is so-so... Nothing to wear. I'll put anything on. Hold on, we have no time. This is good! Let's see. This looks too childish. Yeah, this is it. Dad, try this on. The dress is too short. You normally wear this? Longer dress makes me look like a midget. But still, how can I wear this? Think of the grade you screwed up for me. Dad, sit down. I'll do your hair. This dress, you bought it for me. I did? Yup, for my middle school graduation. Where are we going? We're here. Let's go in. It's got Zoo's 'It's Changing.' It's changing... 'People All Change.' Okay. 'Five People' by Morning Train. Morning Train... Let's see... 'Train to the World.' Not too shabby. They got Zoo's 3rd album. 'Station in Front of City Hall.' Memories... Just after my military draft, I nervously waited for my first love there... What? What? The song, that is. This is here? This is super rare. So cool. I thought you'd hate places like this. I'm glad you like it. Give this a listen. Because I still do not understand you, I am looking for a path to your heart. Shining a bright light on your sorrow, a path that will not change my love. Where could it be, the path to your heart. Could I find it? You feel so far away. Wait for me, wait for me. Until I can understand you. Wait for me, wait for me. Sorry. Until I can understand you. Do-yeon? Do-yeon? Sir! I'm getting off too! Let's part ways here. Do-yeon! I... No! Hi, I'm Do-yeon's dad. Good to meet you, sir. I go to her school, my name is Kang Ji-oh. I didn't know she had a handsome boyfriend. Skin is so fair too... She may be immature but be good to her. Make her happy. What? I heard she passed the audition. I'll support you in any way I can. If you need snack, give me a call, okay? Sure, thank you. Why did you scream 'no' earlier? Dad, let's go home. Not at all, you can do anything. Could you date her? Marriage is good too. Dad! Let him go. You're being weird. That's our house. Mr. Won, I'll be going then. Why? Stay a while. I mean... Take care then. Good night, sir. Bye. Go home. What's with you? I went on that date like you asked. It was my first ever date, I lost it to you. Do-yeon, come here. Ji-oh! There! Your arm will fall off. Thanks, dad. ''Thanks, dad. '' I haven't heard that in a while. Do-yeon, today's the day. Shangpree's revolution! I prepped this for a year. Ju will take care of it, so just read this script. Fine, read what's on here? Tomorrow is the final day, a full week according to grandpa. Let's get through today. Okay. If they ask you any questions, just say ''I'll do my absolute best.'' I'll do my absolute best! Very good. Let's go. In the second graph... The presentation is starting soon? I'm really getting worried. Keep me on the phone, so I can listen in. And when Y is square cube of X, then take a look... With this sticker, smudge a little bit, just like that. Take a look, the make-up revolution! Sticker make-up We got lipstick too, you just stick it on. It's very simple. Let's go, move. Next up is Won Sang-tae from Stock Liquidation team. Good afternoon! I'm department head Won Sang-tae. Good afternoon. We prepared for you Total Beauty Water for teenage girls. Face mist, body mist, hair essence, perfume, deodorizer, a package containing 5 essential items. In line with Shangpree's brand, the 350ml package costs... $50? It will be $50. All components are part of our surplus. We're reusing products we can't get rid of and rebranding them as Total Beauty Water. Shangpree's revolution, Total Beauty Water! It's a decent idea, but who will spend $50 for this? Teenage girls. We'll get idols to promote, and design a trendy packaging. Teens are... spontaneous buyers, they'll buy them. That's my girl! ... and develop new customer base, and maintain Shangpree's brand status. That's the end of my presentation. Thank you. Good! That's it! This is the revolution! Very good! Good work, it's time for my overdue promotion. Lastly, anything to add? ''I'll do my absolute best,'' that's all you have to say. I'll do my absolute best. But... this... won't sell. You said the teens will buy them. Teens aren't stupid. They won't blindly buy because of idol models. Do-yeon, be quiet. Shut your mouth! ... accessories, to snacks, even bus costs are high. But they'll buy $50 mist? Lower the cost. Why are Shangpree products more expensive than others? Plenty of girls didn't buy lip stains due to high cost. If the cost was a bit low, there'd be less unsold goods Teens aren't blind consumers. Teens are Shangpree's future consumers. Don't raise the price, thinking that kids are stupid. Sell high quality items for low price. That, I believe, is Shangpree's real revolution. Can you take responsibility for that? I believe that responsibility comes from understanding others. If you can't do that, what are you taking responsibility for? In order to revolutionize Shangpree, we must understand and acknowledge the teens first. If that's what it means to take responsibility, yes, I'll do that. You're not wrong. But it's not pleasant to hear either. Won Do-yeon! You brat! - Dad! Please! - Stop right there! Dad, can you listen to me? Listen to what? What else is there? You little punk, do you know how many people you got fired? - Is my work a joke? - No, that's not it... Even if you're so immature! What'll you do if me and my team gets the axe? Do you even know what responsibility is? Is it right to say something you know is wrong? Is that responsibility? Why do you always insist that you're right? It's not insisting, I'm worried! - I've gone through it! - What are you worried for? You're not worrying out of habit? Can't you worry with me? Same thing with work too. You can't even object to things you disagree! Isn't that irresponsible? That's why you're a loner! I've had it! Byung-jin, it's Sang-tae. I'm really Sang-tae. Not Do-yeon... Shit! I'm Sang-tae, you son of a bitch! Let go! I gotta talk to my friend! It's okay, leave us please. Outdoor stage in Gyeongju, under the disco lights, we were in black suits and spun white towels. Here we go. Mad singer, Won Sang-tae! Crazy dancer, Jung Byung-jin! I'm mad as hell, I can't bear it anymore. How could you leave me and meet another man? This can't be! I'm walking towards you, how must I face you? Don't misunderstand. Then tell me who he is. It's not the truth. Then tell me the truth. I only love you. I'd rather hear that you'll leave me. But why... You're really Sang-tae? What do I do, Byung-jin? How did it feel to live as her? Well... High school exams nowadays are no joke. They never were, you idiot. Then why did I think that they'd be easy now? Think about what she really wants. Why do you always insist that you're right? Can't you worry with me? Assistant Manager Ju Jang-won Too amazing for a girl! Really amazing! Sir, our entire team was laid off! So why did you... What will you do now? That's my bike... Dad, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Mr. Chairman! What is it? You can't go like this, it's not right. You can't fire my team, sir. You said you'll take responsibility. Then take responsibility. You said we're family! Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! Sir! Mr. Chairman! Sir, are you alright? Dad... Guardian of Kim Myung-joon? Come in here please! Dad's phone is filled with my pics. Dad, can you hear me? It wasn't... because I hated you. I could never meet your expectations... I didn't want to disappoint you later. I thought you'd be ashamed of me. I think I avoided you unknowingly. I'm sorry. Dad, get up. You always said you're alright. Dad, I love you. Do-yeon! Do-yeon? Do-yeon? Do-yeon! Do-yeon! Dad! Sir, the chairman is letting us try again with a low price! Mr. Won, love you. I knew it! See you soon! - Dad! - What? Wait for me. Wait. My baby's all grown up. Of course, I'm your baby. You look good. Dad, let's take a selfie together. Should we? Here we go. One, two... Ji-oh Huh? Why's he calling so early in the morning? - Hey, you! - Do-yeon. - You gotta get to college! - I'm on the way. Hey! Do-yeon! Wait for me! I'm gonna marry dad. Dad, let's go play! I want to marry daddy! I love it when dad buys me treats. Dad, please knock before entering my room. Some allowance before I ask you would be nice. I want to go away on the weekend... Don't tell me come home early because of my boyfriend. I want double eyelid surgery. Please let me do it. I want to live with big eyes. Daddy, I love you! Daddy, I love you! Dad, I love you! Love you! I love you more than anything! Dad... I think I can be pressured to say I love him. I love you. Dad, love you! I love you! Love you! Dad, I love you! Father, I love you! If you were with me, I think I could treat you well, but I have so many regrets. I love you, father. I miss you so much, I regret not saying I love you. I never got to... I still love you, and miss you. I still think of you a lot. DADDY YOU, DAUGHTER ME Where the heck is he at this hour? I told you to call him beforehand. I called him yesterday. He keeps forgetting, nothing I can do. It's a nice day, let's wait a bit. Do-yeon. Did I turn off the stove? Mom, not again. Did you forget to turn it off like last time? Why can't you check that when you're home all day? Home all day? Do you even know what I do at home? Have either of you ever put your clothes in the laundry? Or dishes in the sink after a meal? 365 days a year, I have to think about what to cook! Do you think it's easier than writing your report at work? I'd rather get scolded by bosses at work. I'm getting arthritis from working my butt off, but all I get are complaints, let alone a thank you! My stupid fate. Do you know what it feels like to get scolded by a boss half my age? Forget it, what's the use. Arthritis? I know you watch soap operas and cry like a baby, I go to the office washroom to... Let's drop this. Stop it, both of you. Let's just go home. Fine, whatever! Let's go home! Come on! Directed By Kim Hyung-hyup Mom, when did you get a license? I'm gonna get it this year. I'm so sick of getting driven around by him. I've been hearing that for 10 years. You wanna bet...
