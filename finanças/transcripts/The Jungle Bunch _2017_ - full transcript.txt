Come on, let's get some fresh air. Alright, everyone squeeze in. Thank you. Watch out, it's the final shot! - Yay, striiike! - ...something fishy going on. - You think so? - Saw them out the other day... ...very cozy. What are you wearing?! - But, Dad! - You're not going out like that! Boring? What's with you? Going to a funeral? No, it's my father again? Ugh, lame. Here, here, I'm open! Pedro, you alright? That's gotta hurt. Dream on, Champs, I have more than one trick up my sleeve. Go find shelter. Help! Somebody help! You're safe, kids. The sloth Natacha, I've got the others. Well done, Tony. Mom, Dad! Rhinoceros Watch your back. Yeah, go catch the bad guy. - Yeah, you go, Champs, catch him. - You're the best! The sloth smelled a little rank, you know? That's because he's a hero, no time to shower. Wow, lucky! Missed me again, Champs. The one who'll stop me isn't born yet. We've got him. Igor? Don't move Champs. Step back... or you'll have an omelet on your conscience. I got this. Good job! At least, out here you won't be able to hurt anyone. You haven't seen anything yet. I haven't told you about my research on time-release mushrooms. I planted a bunch of these all over the Jungle, recently? Thanks for taking me to a safe place, Natacha. Champs, what would we do without you! It's our job. Tony, Goliath! Are you okay? And Ricky? He's right behind us. Oh yes, it looks like I will need a raft. You see this seed, my companion in misery,... ...it's my ticket back to the jungle. You seem skeptical, my friend, but I'm very patient. And I mean very patient, I'll come back and take revenge. So, are you really sure about it? Yes, the Champs are no more. Ricky would have wanted us to continue? Ricky would still be with us... ...if I hadn't created this justice team. We all knew the risks, don't feel guilty. The jungle still needs us. The jungle? Look around, Goliath. There is no more jungle. No, I've made up my mind. Farewell, Natacha. Farewell, Tony. Oh, look! You're a future Great Tiger Warrior, aren't you? A warrior? Certainly not. I won't risk anyone's life anymore. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. My little tiger. What will you name your little one? Maurice! Still talking about being a hero! Out of the question, Maurice. - But, Momma? - Go home! No, Momma, I've made my decision to create and train a justice team. You'll see, one day you'll be proud of me. I said it was out of the question! You'll be risking your life! I know what I'm talking about. It's too dangerous and that's that. Goodbye, Momma. Goodbye, Uncle Tony. Junior, rule number one when starting a mission:... ...be observant, okay, son? A little higher. You gotta get between the toes. At least you could try smiling once in a while! Is that a complaint I hear? Do as you're told, or say goodbye to your sacred totem. Go and fetch us some more bananas. You can't just threaten the... ...elephants' sacred totem to get what you want. Ready to go teach them a thing or two? My friends, it's time for some action. Alright, Mr. Maurice. Gilbert, the plan! So, and I? Uh... we paint the peppers yellow, and wrap them in banana peels. Miguel, you wait in the water. Breathe using this, you'll be invisible. Miguel invisible? Miguel happy! And Junior protect the totem. Very good. Come on, guys, let's go. Alright, it's about time. Hey, who told you to stop?! Hot hot!!! Miguel invisible. Miguel really trick you, huh? You nasty red-bottomed monkeys. Thumpy thumpy thump! Thumpy thumpy thump! What's that? That's Miguel beating up your friends. If I were you, I'd surrender now, or you'll face the Jungle Bunch. Surrender? You're a clown, right? I don't like clowns. When I laugh, my abs hurt. I don't like it when my abs hurt. I'll have to use force after all. - Where do I start? - Start by dodging this! Here! Even if it's tempting, we never kick our... ...rival's butt when they're on the ground. - It's not fair. - Hey, you! Don't you think we should go help them? Uh, no, let's stick to the plan, Batricia,... ...I'm sure they're doing just fine. If you say so, Gilbert. Mind if I squeezed in there with you? Can't you see it's already cramped in here? You're not exactly fighting fairly. Wait for me here, son. Problem solved! Well done, Junior, that was close. And you'd better not drag your ugly red butts around here again. Grrr! Mission accomplished. Here's to the Jungle Bunch. - Hip hip? - Hooray! Well, it grew back, Surimi. I can't believe it. I'll be a little more diligent this time. I'm proud of you, you get better with every mission. Once I retire, I know you'll be ready to... ...maintain justice in the jungle. Yes, sort of like I took over for Granny. Of course you'll meet her one day. I just don't know which day... Hello guys! How was the mission? Awesome, guys, everyone was great, as usual. Glad to be back, this has been quite a hike. No problem, we've made you a delicious snack to perk you up. And voila! Lukewarm fresh squeezed cockroach juice for everyone! It looks delicious but? My stripes are a bit washed out, I have to paint them on again. Oh thank you. A beautiful ficus flower as garnish. And the floating things? Those are marinated slugs, they help balance out the sourness. 'kay, let's toast! Oh, shoot, I forgot... ...Miguel is allergic to ficus flowers. The signal! What a shame,... ...we can't even try your taste treats. But duty calls! The Jungle Bunch... ...to the rescue!!! Good mission! Why do they all go in different directions only to... ...meet up again down there? I think it's some sort of ritual,... ...it's kind of a bonding thing. And open. Hello my friend, what brings you here? Oh, the Jungle Bunch, help me, I've got a big problem. Tell me, that's why we're here. Look! Inflammation of the epidermis, some small red spots... Nothing serious, just a bit of eczema, be right back. Three times a day for a week, it'll clear right up. Thank you Jungle Bunch, what would we do without you? Now that I think of it... um... I don't have arms, so, if you could give me a hand... Let's draw straws to pick the one to? Thank you, I feel better already. If only everyone could be as kind as you guys are. Unlike those people who build barbecues in the forest,... ...not even realizing how dangerous it is. An opportunity to try out Gilbert's new invention! It shouldn't take long for the Champs to get here. Banzai! We're just in time, the fire hasn't spread too far. Who the heck is that? Brace yourselves. Do it Gilbert! Wow, that's quite a show. Hey, let me see. AL Hold on a minute, Bob! You could've made your own, instead of frying slugs. Well done, Gilbert, great invention. Uh, Maurice, it's still a prototype,... ...I didn't think we'd be using it so soon? It still needs a few adjustments. Like, uh? The landing gear for example? See you guys down there! Oops, I don't see them anymore. Oh my, there might be injuries. I'll get the first-aid kit. Hey, Maurice! You okay, son? What are you doing? Hurry up, there's something fishy going on over here. What did you find? Well, don't mind us, my friends. Arriving without notice, like the Champs? Putting out the fire, like the Champs? Basically, everything like the Champs. But, but?you're not the? ...Champs? There you go, you're not the Champs, you don't say! Excuse me but, the Champs,... ...they retired a good number of years ago. You been on a desert island? Be careful, Surimi, this tiger is very perceptive. Now, it's us, the Jungle Bunch, in charge of maintaining the peace. If you have a problem, feel free to ask for help. I do have a little favor I'd like to ask. Could you please scoot over to your right just a little bit? That'd help a lot. Very good, thank you. Surimi! Oh great! How would you like us to help you? Uh... it's a trap, Maurice. You bandit, wait till we get out of here,... ...you'll see what we're truly capable of! Try, but you can't escape out of this foam. I created it to catch the Champs. To catch the Champs? - Don't you dare go near my mother! - Your mother? I see? Oh, so you're Natacha's son. Well, that's perfect. Surimi! These mushrooms are, let's say? More deadly. Don't take it personally,... ...but when Natacha finds out I reduced her son to ashes,... ...she'll bring her team back together... ...and then I'll capture them. And then, finally,... ...I'll be able to destroy the jungle,... ...and I'll put the Champs in the... ...front row so they can watch the catastrophe I create! Farewell, the Jungle Bunch. And thanks! This one might hurt a little. Al, Bob, you're just in time, thank you! Well, no thanks to you, Maurice. Yeah, going on a mission so far away... ...without taking the first-aid kit! Can we talk about this later, we're about to... To?! We've been worried sick, and you're having a foam party. Not cool, we're allowed to have fun too! Yahoo! No!!! Gilbert, any ideas? Gilbert? We have to throw a rock on that small branch. So, Gilbert? Wait Maurice, patience? Patience! That was close. If this koala has something against the... ...Champs, Granny's in danger! Let's hurry, come on, everyone. If you could unglue us, we'll come with you? Yeah, we don't want to miss the occasion to meet your mom. Uh, okay, but... I can't believe you've waited until she is in danger to introduce us. Yes, she's in danger, so we need to get? I've been dying to meet her for years, too! Miguel go to meet mommy of Mr. Maurice! - Miguel happy. - Okay, but she's in danger! Shall we go, now? Yeah, enough is enough. I'm tired of always getting beaten up by the Jungle Bunch. It's annoying, we can't work without being bothered. We won't get anywhere as long as the Jungle Bunch are here. Too bad, cuz I feel like we could become famous bandits, too. That's true. Everyone would know us. It's just not fair. There you go, Surimi, we just found our army. Are you comfortable, Gilbert? You can hold me tighter if you want. No, I'm fine. Can you believe it? The Great Tiger Warrior's mother. She must be super proud of you, Maurice! Yes, we'll be there soon. I hope everything goes well. No, no, no, don't wait for us, we'll make you late. Uh, I'm not sure they intend to wait for us. I hope we made it before Mr. Psycho-koala. Maurice? What's going on? Uncle Tony, you okay? And where is Mom? Junior! Maurice, you've finally brought my grandson for a visit. Wait, let's make sure the parameters are secured. Batricia, aerial reconnaissance! - But... Maurice?Why are you? - Shh? Shh... - Yes, but? - Shh. - Yes but? but why? I just? - Shh... Shh... Wait. Maurice, what is all this about? Just tell? But, Mom! What's with all this sneaking around? Will you tell us what's going on? Oh, a crazy koala with exploding... ...mushrooms wants to catch you and destroy the jungle. Igor is back! What's that? Igor? Sorry but? Ooo, sorry.. Mom? Mom? Mooom! - Mom! - No! - Mom! - Not now! Ma? Ma? Ma? Hey, that's enough now. All clear, Maurice, no sign of that psycho-koala around anywhere. Pleased to meet you. Okay, so, who's this Igor, exactly? You never mentioned him. Igor is the worst enemy that we've ever faced? Yet, a long time ago, he looked up to us. He even wanted to join the Champs. Hi, Champs. I won't beat around the bush,... ...I want to join your group. I'll be your new leader. Ew, it's ugly here, maybe we should redecorate. Now then, you, tigress, go make me some banana juice. We made him understand that he wasn't hero material. But he was stubborn, he spent months... ...creating his explosive mushrooms,... ...and he came back, telling us how useful they would be to us. I can give you as many as you want, if you make me your new leader. Of course, we declined his offer. And don't ever come back here! He never forgave us for rejecting him,... ...and ever since, he's been wanting... ...to use his invention to destroy the jungle. Fine, here's the plan:... ...after what Igor said about wanting to catch the Champs,... ...let's go pick up Goliath,... ...we'll put you in our den safe and sound and then we can? Let me tell you the plan:... ...Tony and I, we go get Goliath, while you wait for us here. Mom, not again? We are the Jungle Bunch! We'll take care of this. You know very well I never wanted you to become a hero,... ...and now look, you're dragging my grandson into this too! Here we go once again. She never changes, always so stubborn. My friends, let's go to the savanna. Let's go get Goliath. AL Yeah, okay, go on ahead, we'll meet you there. I can't believe it, he never changes,... ...always so stubborn. Don't you think you're a little tough on him? Do you want him to end up like Ricky? Of course not, Natacha. I love him like you do. ...don't underestimate them. It's a dangerous mission. And once we've caught the Champs,... ...no one will stand in our way to destroy the jungle! Any questions? Yes? How we gonna destroy the jungle, boss? Ahh, very good question, I like people who take an interest. So, I realized that it's useless... ...to burn the jungle to the ground,... ...as seen in Exhibit A, since it'll just grow back. So, I imagined a much more effective plan. This cave...leads to an underground... ...rift that stretches under the entire jungle. My mushrooms are going to... ...explode at the heart of said rift,... ...causing the jungle to collapse,... ...and very soon, be totally swallowed up by the ocean. I actually worked quite hard on these drawings. Notice the detail on the terror in the faces. Anyway, any other questions? Yes? Isn't it dangerous to destroy the jungle? I suppose, a little, but sometimes, life's about taking risks. Knowing how to commit, having a vision for the jungle's future. You're scared, huh? Don't wanna destwoy your wittle jungle? Other questions? No? Good. Perfect. Let's get to work! Come on, hurry, shake a leg! Hey stop that, it's a figure of speech! Build a door, there. You look awful, I like it, you're in. You seem suspicious, you're in. You're good too. Look at just how cute you are. Get out of here! On the other hand, you are one ugly bird! Go ahead, you're a VIP. Hey Hyena. You're in. Phew, this has been quite a hike. You look kinda slithery, go on in. Nice masks, love the old school gangster look, you're in. I heard there's illegal fighting in there? Just so you know, the guys behind us are the Jungle Bunch. You know, the Justice Team. I heard they're here to stop those fights. Underground fights make that tiger crazy. Just saying? Drinks are on me, buddy. You can't go in. Uh, why not? I don't like you. Oh? uh? But, we're together! We're all full. Dang, what tough luck, thank you, Sir. Well, it's all full up. Thankfully, there was room for those two. Let's wait here till they're back. Hmm? that seems a little fishy... Yeah, come on! Hey, Goliath, wake up! - Doesn't hurt. - Doesn't hurt. - Doesn't hurt. - Doesn't hurt. - Doesn't hurt. - Doesn't hurt. - Doesn't hurt. - Doesn't hurt. Brandon, you got him, the old man's done. Just finish him, quickly, okay? Doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Actually it's starting to sting a bit... Here we go, shoo. You're done, old man! Nobody... ...calls... ...Goliath... ...an old man! Go on back to your sandbox! And the winner is? ...Goliath! Let's give him a round of ap? But? They're taking their time. Surimi, let me sleep. I almost forgot, we've been preparing... ...a little surprise for the Champs! Come on Surimi, let's go. Hurry up. What exactly is going on? Some lunatic is blowing up the Death Canyons. We need the Jungle Bunch. The Jungle Bunch are on vacation. We're repla? Whoop whoop whoop, no, no, no! Heroes don't have time to rest. You were really going to try and kick Igor's butt without us? But it's our job! No, it's between Igor and the Champs. But Mom, it's pure madness, it's a trap. That should be us going there. And then what? You want us to stay put and do nothing? It's out of the question, right, guys? Come on, let's be reasonable, here. You're a little bit too old for that. Just enjoy retirement, do some gardening,... ...and let us deal with...the problem... I don't think you realize who you're talking to, shrimp! And nobody calls me old! Uh, yes, but no, I mean? Uh? Mature? Senior citizen? Calm down, Mr. Goliath. What he's trying to say is maybe... ...you should practice before re-enlisting? One of my friends is dead because of Igor,... ...and I won't let anyone take care of him for me. We don't need a group of youngsters with no experience. No experience? Now we've heard it all! The Jungle Bunch go on extremely dangerous missions every day. You can ask anyone. The Jungle Bunch... ...rules, they really do! Yeah, for instance, evil baboons... ...were threatening our sacred statue and... Yeah, they're the best, I'll prove it. Look at this! See, not a single pimple, no more itching. The Jungle Bunch are heroes, aren't they? And it was the Great Tiger Warrior himself,... ...who put the lotion on my butt! Oh, yeah... That's what real heroes do. Look, we can't stand around all day,... ...there's a real problem out there! Come on, let's go. You go take shelter. Come on, let's follow them. What are they doing? Mom, wait! Gilbert, find a way to get to the other side. It took you Champs long enough! Do you think it was fun waiting for you for hours? Igor! You sound mad. At me? You want me? I'm right here. Ahhh, I get it, you're scared... ...I'm so disappointed, extremely. You've become soft. Let's face it, you've all gotten quite old. Wait, Goliath! Surimi, ignition! So simple, almost too easy. Alright, close the trap. Looks like trouble over there. Faster, guys! Will you all just hold still? You're just slowing us down. Goliath, clear the way. Tony, the baboons. I'm taking care of Igor. Come on, guys. Surimi, do something! I think they really need us, now! Ready, Gilbert? What do you think? Fine, let's do it. Miguel? Banzai... I'm gonna help! It's over, Igor, you lost. It's over, Igor, you lost. Maurice? Maurice! Goliath, stop! Help us, I won't be able to hold on very much longer. Surimi, this may be our chance. Go for it. It's fine. Let's go. Junior? Mom? Is everyone alright? Mom! Junior? Igor, you coward, let my son go! I'm sorry, Maurice, I can't release Junior,... ...he's actually the perfect hostage. But thank you for getting involved,... ...without you, I surely would've been caught. Maurice! Miguel help Mr. Maurice. I'll deal with this, kid. Bravo, Jungle Bunch, we had it all under control! Igor was at our mercy. Without you, everything would be over. Don't look at us, it's who? You ruined everything! - What happened? - What happened?! Igor ran away and Junior was kidnapped! Not little tiger. Maurice, is that true? Junior was kidnapped because of you, Maurice. And now, do you still think becoming a hero was a good idea? But we can't just stay here and do nothing,... ...let's go and free Junior. We need to free him? Stay out of this, Jungle Bunch! Is that totally clear, Maurice? You've caused enough trouble, already. Wow, Maurice, you're really good at... ...faking being down, you almost got me. You look crushed by what just happened,... ...really, you're quite the actor, bravo! So? What's the plan? Free Junior before the Champs? No, it's best to let the Champs deal with this alone, guys. But, Mr. not go? Mr. must save little tiger! What if I make another mistake... If I put Junior in danger again? No, my mother is right: I've caused enough trouble. They'll do better without me. But we need to help them! Maurice. But Mr. never give up, Mr. Maurice. Mr. Great Tiger Warrior. There is no Great Tiger Warrior, there never was. Maybe there's a reason I don't have stripes? But the whole jungle needs you, Maurice! I'm not even able to protect my own family,... ....let alone the jungle? Come back, Maurice! Mr. Maurice? You picked a great time to break your wing... I wasn't trying to be mean or anything,... ...I was just mentioning it in passing. Don't worry my little Surimi, they're not in such good shape now. He's landing. Let's go! You're so predictable! No but, really... it's almost depressing. On the count of three, open your mouth and say "ah":... ...one? two? three! Junior! You okay, sweetie? You're so adorable. You remind me of your father at that age? Aww, now isn't this a touching moment. You just wait till I get out of here Igor? I'll squash you like an insect! No, Goliath, let me make this clear. You're not getting out. You see these mushrooms around the door? They're not decorations, though quite pretty,... ...they're explosives. That's right, the door is booby-trapped,... ...only this key can open it. I know it's rude to leave your... ...guests right after they got here,... ...but I still have some work to do to destroy the jungle. Okay, catch the Champs and keep them prisoners in my den, check! What was next? Oh, yes, slaves, lots of slaves? You'll see, Mom, one day you'll be proud of me? Hey, you're a real little tiger! Don't worry, I will take care of you. I'll teach you how to do that and many other things, son. The Great Tiger Warrior and his... ...son will bring justice back to this jungle. Everything will be okay, Junior, Granny will save you? Hey, can we get some water, please? Thanks. Hey, you two! You think it's funny slowing everyone down? Back to work before I get mad. That's better. Some people didn't get it the... ...first time, so I'm going to have to say it again... You are all just slaves! So please stop asking for water, it slows you down. I mean, really, some people think the... ...world owes them... Oh, by the way, when I say go faster,... ...that means faster than I told you before. Or the watering won't be done by tonight! What are you doing here? It's for the prisoners. These are for me! Sorry, we still haven't found a way to get you out. I really want to be a believer like you are, Junior. Right, it's all his fault that we're here in the first place. What do you mean, "our fault too"? He's not wrong, we might not be here... ...if we had listened to Maurice... Uh, news from the outside isn't good, I'm afraid,... ...disappeared. The Jungle Bunch have been looking... ...everywhere for days, but nothing as of yet. He has always been there to protect us. Who's going to free us, now? This kid is so brave. He's your grandson, after all. Thatta boy, little one, go find your dad! Still nothing, guys? We can't waste more time looking for him? We have no choice, we've got to go and free Junior,... ...the Champs, the slaves, and stop Igor... without Maurice. Miguel not go! Miguel wait for Mr. Maurice. Gilbert is right, Miguel, as always. We can't wait anymore, we need to do something. Miguel not move! You know, Miguel, I heard there's a lot of bananas in Igor's den? Mountain of bananas! Miguel not move! And a lot of other friends to pounce on? Thumpy thumpy thump. Miguel not move! Junior! I knew Granny would find a way to save you! What? They're prisoners? With hundreds of slaves? Hey, son, how about we go kick some koala butt? Miguel not move! Miguel...wait...Mr. Maurice. Miguel sad. And open. Come on, pull it together, we've got work to do. Miguel so sad,... ...Miguel hear Mr. Maurice's voice everywhere. Dear slaves, I am pleased to announce the... ...harvest of explosive mushrooms is over. Congratulations everyone! You will now be taken back to your cells. So, I think I deserve a little nap before I destroy the jungle. Got it Miguel? We're baboons bringing... ...fruit and vegetables to Igor. Miguel understand Mr. Maurice. What is that for? - We're bringing? - Miguel not from the Jungle Bunch. Miguel, bad monkey, bring fruit and vegetables for Igor bad koala. Okay, you can go. Come on, everyone inside. Faster, come on. Okay, let's go. Uh, you have to walk, Maurice. Oh, right, sorry. Let me sleep, it's not time yet! That thing must be defective. Okay, let it cool down, and we'll have the key. Perfect, Batricia, Gilbert, your turn! We attract the guards by talking into this, right? Exactly, but I think you need to pull this lever down first. See? Working, not working. Working, not working. Working... Working... Working... That's Gilbert! ...not working. Working, not working. Okay, Gilbert, like this... Hello, it's the Jungle Bunch talking! We're at the top of the tower, we just set all the slaves free. We're putting an end to the mean koala's plans. It's them! - They made it! - Let's hear it! The Jungle Bunch? Junior did it! Up here, yoo hoo, can you hear us? Aren't you going to come and get us? Yoo hoo! It's us, the Jungle Bunch. Are you going to stand here all day and let them do whatever they want? Some popcorn, perhaps? - Oh yes, popcorn would be great. - That's very nice, thank you. You're going to move your butts... ...as fast as you can, and capture them! Look Batricia, it's working! - It looks like a diversion. - Yeah, you're right! Too bad these two didn't take the bait... Guys, shouldn't you be out there helping your friends? They're too scared to face the Jungle Bunch? Uh, no, Miguel not scared of Miguel. Jungle Bunch, is that you? Careful, the railings are booby-trapped! The Jungle Bunch has everything planned. Oops. Don't worry Maurice. We've got this! Looks like there's a problem. We'll have to buy time, Batricia. Then let's get to work! There! And take this! Wow, it's getting heated... Let him go right now, you brute! Are you okay, Gilbert? Phew, I got really scared. You got scared? And me, don't you think I got scared? In this kind of situation,... ...I'd rather you keep your cool, Batricia! But, Gilbert, I wasn't worried... ...for me, I was worried for you. Well, stop worrying for me, it's completely absurd. But you know I can't help it, Gilbert. You can't? Why not? You really have no idea why, Gilbert? It's because I love you!!! Oh, my, wasn't it obvious? I've been in love with you since I met you! Can anyone be more blind than you! In lo?love? With? With me? Bu...but? Okay... So... Your weird and inappropriate behavior was merely your way of? Disturbing smiles, how you stare at me,... ...make me feel uncomfortable,... ...the useless presents you give me, these? We get it, if you don't like me, just say! You're not going to make a list of all... I'd like to keep this between us, a relationship at work... ...it's always tricky. Okay, it'll be our little secret. Anyway, your plan is going smoothly,... ...that's what I call a diversion! Now I get it, the Jungle Bunch are trying to stab me in the back. Hey, you, get down here, you worthless monkeys! The prisoners are getting away! Up, down, make up your mind. Maurice! The key! Thumpy? Thumpy. Thumpy. Not too bad, for a young tiger. Yeah, excellent job! - Maurice! - Mom! Friends not wait Miguel to thumpy! Thumpy thumpy thump! Thumpy thumpy thump! Mom, I'm sorry I ruined everything? ...in the Death Canyons, I thought I was helping. Don't apologize... I should have realized how important... ...your work is for this jungle. Everyone believes in you, Maurice... ...in you and in your Jungle Bunch. We do, too. Thumpy thumpy thump! Bob, you okay? Yesh, jush fine. We need to help them! - Hold on real tight, Gilbert. - It would be my pleasure, Batricia. Let's go! Banzai! I'm so proud of you, pussycat. Thanks, Mom. Could you not call me pussycat in front of the others? Sorry, I'm too sensitive. It's so touching to see a... ...family reunited after all this time. And to think, it's thanks to me... Well, that's done with. I have a jungle to destroy! Enjoy the show! What's going on? - Earthquake! - Run! Mom, I'm scared! If the explosions reach the... ...center of the rift, the jungle will collapse! It's time the Jungle Bunch and the Champs worked together. Uh, let's split. You, get everyone out of here. We'll stop this. Come on, this way, follow me! Hurry up! Follow me, guys! Al, Bob, the lever! That's a problem. We can't avoid that one, there's no lever! Miguel fix bridge. Gilbert, how do we stop the chain reaction? We just have to remove some mushrooms... ...before the explosions reach the center. Okay, and how close are we? Real close. One thing's for sure, Igor doesn't exactly cut corners. Over there, Maurice! Okay? Miguel, you're going to catapult me. Take this! Junior, block the wagon! Banzaiii! Bravo Maurice. Hurrah!!! There you go, problem solved. Some tidying to do, though. Ahh, ahh, watch out Maurice! Huh? Watch out, Maurice! What? Sorry, I can't really hear you from here. Watch out! Oops. Phew, well done, son. Would have been quite a boom. The shaking has stopped. They did it! Oh, hey look! Uh? who are they? No idea? Maurice?! Excuse me, everyone,... ...sorry to interrupt the celebration,... ...but I'd like to remind you... ...I won't be satisfied till I have my revenge. So I will be back. I'll avenge myself on the Champs, and the Jungle Bunch! And I'll destroy this jungle. Maybe it's time this koala learns that you never pick a fight... ...with tigers! Well done, son! Long live the Jungle Bunch, hurrah!!! Long live the Champs! Long live the Champs, hurrah!!! You're right, Maurice, the jungle will always need heroes. Thanks, Mom. And it's in safe hands! You senior citizens weren't too bad, after all. What did you say, you shrimp? I got you, little squirt! And you have a sense of humor! It's time for the Champs to retire, for good. And I think we deserve a little break now, don't we? You ready, Gilbert? Uh, well? why not. But please keep your distance from me, Batricia! - It's embarrassing, right? - A little, yes. I think our break will have to wait! The Jungle Bunch... ...to the rescue!!! Be careful, pussycat! Mom! Now, do you see this little seed here,... ...this is our return ticket to the jungle.
