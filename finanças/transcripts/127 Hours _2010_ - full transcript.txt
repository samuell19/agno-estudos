Hey, Aron here. Leave a message. Hey Aron. Sonja here... again. I know that you're probably gonna do ways this week-end, but listen, just think about what we're gonna play, please, 'coz we have to decide and we really need to practice. Anyway, it'll be fun, I promise. And, oh! Please call mom, please 'coz she worries. Which, you know, all right... Later, A. Bye! It's Friday night! April 25th, 2003. I'm just heading to Canyonlands Just me, the music and the night! Love it! Blue John Canyon, guide book says: "1 h 30 min to the Big Dropper." I am to take 45 mins of that. You're doing Blue John, too, huh? No. Actually, we're headed for the Dome. - But I think we're lost. - She's lost. Hang on. Oh, my God! Let's see this. You are... here. We are? - And... - I knew that. And, the Dome, is there. I can take you that way if you like. Sorry the... Friday the 13th there. Child killer look. I'm only a psychopath on week days and today is saturday, so... Can't take this off... My face. Nice! Aron. Kristi. Allow me to introduce you to my friend Megan. - Nice to meet you. - It's an honor. What do you say? You're lost, I'm a guide... Feel good. Why not. - Sure. - All right. This way. So you bike from Horseshoe. Is that like 20 miles ? 17 on the odometer. I thought it was 17.2! 17.3, actually. You're one of those... - I'm not one of those. - You spend a lot of time out here? That's my second home. See? There's the fork, right there. We totally missed that. Glad we bumped into you. What are the odds, considering we're all the way out here? Exactly. You go to the one place in America you guaranteed not to run into a weirdo. And what happen?! All right. So the guide book says that the route's through here. But I know a better way. The cool way. Guaranteed, best time you can have with your clothes on. Although, it's better with your clothes off. It is a bit of a climb. - We climb! - And a bit of a squeeze. We squeeze. So you get us all the way back in here, and then you tell us that you're not a guide. Well no, I'm an engineer. But this is what I really wanna do. That's wonderful to hear. I've always wanted to be a supermodel but I don't think that's actually gonna workout, you know? Jesus! What if these things move? They've been here for millions of years. They're not gonna move. - Sure they will! - What?! Everything is moving all the time. Let's just hope not today! Great. All right. Now, all you got to remember is that everything will be okay. Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Aron? Are you okay? Aron? Listen to the guy, he is fine. Yeah. He's bad shit. You're bad shit! Come on! You've got to come down here! Trust me! - Trust you? We'll kill you Aron! - Oh, please. You love this. Nice job! - Megan, you're missing it! - Come on, it's amazing! - Oh, fuck, fuck. - Just jump, Megan. Fuck! You okay? - Nice job! - I can't believe you did it! - Okay, we have to do it again! - Again? Camera, camera! So, Blue John, is actually named after this guy Blue John who was Butch Cassidy's cook. From Butch Cassidy and the Sundace Kid. And they would hide out in these Canyons, I guess. But also what they do is they run wild horses into here and they trap them at the end of the Canyon. That's how they caught the horses. - One more picture before I go? - Yeah! Okay, cool. Ready? One, two, three... Blue John, blue cheese... Well, will I ever see you again? That depends. Do you party? Do I party? Yeah, sometimes. Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party if you wanna come. You should come by and have a bear. Kick back. Okay, where am I going? It's about 20 miles away, near Green River behind the old motel. It's behind that. There's gonna be a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo. Really? Okay. - Cool! - Okay! It was good to met you. - See ya! - Bye! Scooby-Doo! Rock on! You think he's gonna show up? I don't think we figured in his day at all. You liked him! This is insane! Move this fucking rock! Please. Oh, God. Kristi! Megan! Is there anyone?! Think. Just think. Fuck! Shit! Shit! Fucker! Sweet! Knife is dull. Look at the size of this one, man. How the fuck did this get here? Okay. Hey, buddy. Here we go. It's 3:05, on Sunday, April 26th, 2003. This marks, 24 hours of being stuck in Blue John Canyon. Right where it slots up before the Big Drop. My name is Aron Ralston, my parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of Englewood, Colorado, and... Whoever find this can keep the recorder. Just... Please try and get in touch with my parents and give them this tape. I'd appreciate it. I was descending Blue John, yesterday, when this chockstone came loose and rolled onto my arm and now it's stuck and... my thumb has this kind of this gray-blue color. It's been without circulation for 24 hours. So... I think it's pretty well gone. I'm low on food. That's about... 300-400 ml. And that's it for water. I'm in pretty deep doo here. Please! There's someone down here! Help! I'm in the Canyon! Help! Help! Down here! Help! Don't loose it. Aron, do not loose it. Not bad. Dinner. Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party if you wanna come. You should come by and have a bear. Kick back. There's gonna be a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo. Scooby-Doo... Mountain Dew? Plastic cup. Thank you. Might take a beer as well. Don't mind if I do? Aron here. Leave a message. Aron, it's mom. I was hoping to catch you. Are you there? Hello? Okay. Nothing urgent. Dad is in New York, so it'll be a quiet week-end. Call me, okay? Lost of love. Where are you going? Don't know yet. Right there, Brian. Maybe you tell me and I'll be somewhere else. Have a good one. Always do. Always do. Let's go. Crap. This is freaking me out looking at myself like that. Sorry, I hope that's okay. It's Monday. Bummer, all day. I tried to set up this pulley all morning, but it didn't work. It was worth a try but there is too much friction and it's... a climbing rope, so there's too much stretch. What I could really use is about 20 meters of static rap rope, 9.8 mm. 3 or 4 pulleys, A rack of carabiners, a sling, power drill, and a pull kit. And 8 burly men to do all the hawling. That should just about do it. I have... 150 ml of water left. What should keep me alive till... Tomorrow night. If I'm lucky. I peed twice. I almost piss my pants. My body is actually acting really weird. The second time, I did it in the camelback. It smells really bad. But... I'm sure it'll settle. It's got to be chilled, like Sauvignon Blanc. No number twos. Which should disappoint my insect friends. They'll just have to wait. Let's, see. What else could I tell you? There is this raven that comes every morning. I clocked it at 8:17. I'll film it for you tomorrow. Every morning at 9:30. I get fifteen minutes of sunlight. Really nice. I've been chipping away. More to... More to keep warm than anything. And I'm beginning to think that my hand is supporting the rock. So when I chip away a little bit, it actually settles more. So... I found this great tourniquet. It hurts. It hasn't been very useful. Listen. Don't buy the cheap made-in-China multi-tool. I tried to find my Swiss Army knife, but... This thing came free with a flashlight. The flashlight was a piece of shit too. I kept it in my truck for emergencies. Not that I'm blaming you, mom. It was a... perfectly great stocking stuffer. There is no way you could have known that I'd get in this kind of trouble. So you have to leave the camera to us if we want to watch what you've made. - Yeah. - Good job, hon. So he's filming her now. And we see it there, live. Well done, okay. Way to go, sis. - Keep playing? - Yes, honey, keep going. Fuck! So... How do I get in? What's the... you know... combination? If I told you, I'd have to kill you. You've already kill me. Combination? I think I have it. Fuck. Who's there? Aron? Please! Please! Please! - Good morning every body... - It's the morning show... Good morning everyone! It is seven o'clock here, in Canyonlands, U.S.A. And this morning, on the boulder, we have a very special guest, self-proclaimed American super hero... Aron Ralston! Let's hear it for Aron! Hi, oh, gosh, it's... It's a real pleasure to be here, thank you. Thank you. Hey, can I say "hi" to my mom and dad? Mom and dad? Mustn't forget mom and dad, right Aron? Yeah, that's right. Hey mom. I'm really sorry I... I didn't answered the phone the other night... If I had I would have told you where I was going an then... I probably wouldn't be here right now. That's for sure! But like I always say: "Your supreme selfishness "is our gain." Thank you Aron. Anyone else you'd like to say "hi" to ? - Brian, at work. - Hi, Aron. I probably won't be making it in to work today. Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait, hold on. We've got a question coming in from another Aron, in Loser Canyon, Utah. Aron asks: Am I right in thinking even if Brian from work notifies the police, they'll put a 24-hour hold on it before they file a missing persons report, which means you won't become officially missing until midday Wednesday at the earliest? Yeah, you're right on the money there, Aron. Which means, I'll probably be dead by then. Aron, from Loser Canyon, Utah, how do you know so much? Well, I'll tell you how I know so much. I volunteer for the rescue service. You see, I'm some kind of a... well, a big fucking heart hero. And I can do everything on my own, you see? I do see! Now... Is it true that despite, or maybe because you're a big fucking heart hero, you didn't tell anyone where you were going? Yeah, that's absolutely correct. Anyone? Anyone. Mom, dad, I just wanna take this time to tell you that the time we spent together was awesome. And I haven't appreciated you in my heart as I know that I could. Mom, I love you. And I wish that I had returned all your calls, ever. I love you, guys. And I'll always be with you. This is no Slurpee. It's like a bag of piss. I'm going again! With clothes on. - Megan, tell him. - We're very worried about you. We're worried about your musical choices. If you keep singing Phish you'll never get a girlfriend. You might have one, but I really don't think you do. - You may be sort of cute. - Occasions are scarce for you. Okay. This canon ball is for you. I'm going to... I'm going to test your theory about whether or not it's better to do it without your clothes on. Don't... Don't... Ralston, rock on. You don't even want me here, do you? I'm gonna go, Aron. Is that what you want? It is, isn't it? Okay. Come back. You're gonna be so lonely, Aron. 46, 47, 48... 49, 50! Aron, I'm coming! I'm holding on. Time is moving really slowly. My heart is beating really fast. I swear to God, it feels like it's beating like three times faster than it should be. So cold... Blue John? You... Rana, - I've been thinking about you girl. - I've been thinking about you girl. I know how I am. I tried to do everything. How I was... I tried. What you guys are doing here? Eddy? Tom? Hey, guys. What's going on? Eric? Hey. You look like the Hole in the Wall Gang. Dorks. Found you, Aron. Sis, I'm sorry that I won't be at your wedding. I know that I promised to play. That we play. I'm sorry. I know it'll be a good one. 8:15. there's no raven. 8:20. I didn't tell you my raven didn't come. I've been thinking, everything is... It just comes together. You're gonna be so lonely, Aron. Always do. Later! It's me. Aron, it's mom. I was hoping to catch you. I chose this. Dad's in New-York, so it'll be a quiet week-end. I chose all of this. Call me, okay? Lots of love! This rock, This rock has been waiting for me my entire life. I hate this rock! In it's entire life. Ever since it was a bit of meteorite. A million billion years ago. Up there in space. It's been waiting... to come here. Right, right here. I've been moving towards it my hole life. The minute I was born every breath I've taken every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface. Come on. Don't pass out. Thank you. Easy. Help! Please! Help me! I need help! I need agua... I'm Aron Ralston. Since Saturday I was trapped by a boulder. No water for 5 days. I cut my arm off. Please, some water. Thank you. - You've got a phone? - Yes, but no signal. You should stop and rest. No, I better keep going. Can one of you run? Can one of you run ahead? {\He met his wife Jessica three years later.} {\Aron continues to be a climber and a Canyoneer.} {\He always leaves a note to say where he has gone.}
