Sorry, I don't speak French, but that was an incredible performance you just gave there. Was it? A performance you couldn't understand? Perhaps I was simply reciting my grocery list, no? (Takes a drag) Well, I aspire to perform poetry one day. Like you. Ooh, like me! Is that so? And what is stopping you? I don't know. I mean... I'm gonna give you the best piece of advice. You see, one needs to go into the dark void. Have his soul crushed. Burned. Chaos. Disorder. Anarchy. Then rise again like a phoenix from the ashes. You have to live and breathe poetry. Sometimes you won't even have a dime in your pocket, but your heart is on fire. Why? Because it's been stepped on a thousand times and can only exist by bursting into flames every second of the day. Forget it. It's no life for Have you ever even loved? With the fire of a dozen suns? (Sighs) Follow the sheep, boy. You'll be much happier that way.

This one-year preparatory curriculum will prepare you to excel in the medical program. Can you do it? I have faith that you can. Hard work, dedication, and listening. So, you are here, because your passion for medicine and science, and your dream to become a doctor are your life's mission. We're here to help, we're here to give. Let's do this together. Welcome to your first day of pre-med. This is the start of your future. Now, you'll have courses in molecular biology, physiology, metabolism, cell biology. Also, we operate courses in humanities and social sciences. Then, you'll be able to move forward into the main program. But-- it's a big but. PROFESSOR: Humanities and social sciences, but-- and this is a big but, you must maintain a 3.5 cumulative grade point average. (Monitor beeping) (Sighs) When your mother passed, your father became completely closed. I used to ask him how he was doing, and he would answer, "I can't afford emotions." Can't afford. (Sighs) Always balancing the books. Perhaps he was trying to-- to protect his sanity or his heart. Your mom, she had a good soul. (Hani sighing) She always insisted on emotional honesty, always. If she were here today, she would demand it just the same, hmm? My own son doesn't think he needs me. But I want you to know that if you need to talk, I'm here for you.

You miss one, you catch the next. Do you understand? Okay. RAMY: You know, Tam, before mom died, I promised her that I would study hard to become a doctor. (Gulps, grunts) And now, she's gone. And I wonder, "Does any of this even matter anymore?" (Sighs) I don't know, man. Nothing really matters. We're just germs spinning on a rock in the universe, and we have to get jobs on top of it. That's bullshit. (Grunts) (Blows a raspberry) Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my time. I love the old stuff, you know? The classics. (Sighs) But music now, it's just shit. I mean the older stuff is like... ...like a tiger in the wild. It's dangerous, and it's exciting, and it's everything you could ever hope to be. But then you see the tiger in the zoo with the fake landscape, and it's not the same. The stripes and the teeth are there, but it's just not the same.

Don't worry about me and her. Besides what of it? (Désirée sighing) You know, you have the audacity to come here and inquire about Yaz when you didn't even return my phone call? RAMY: What phone call? (Sighs) Crap. I never check my voicemail app. Désirée, I'm so sorry. DÉSIREE: Are you serious? Do you think that I am Yaz's pimp? That I can just go around and you know, make an arrangement for you to get in her pants? (Sighs) I have my own life, my own interests, and who Yaz is or isn't gonna sleep with is not one of them. (Désirée sighing) Look, I have to get ready for my chakra workshop. I really have to get ready. Can I-- (Sighs) Can I at least give you this? Open it, please. (Paper rustles) Give it to your muse.

It's a sacred river. See? It's like our vein, you know what? You can throw it your sorrows if you want, but not your garbage. (Birds squawking in distance) RAMY: It wasn't rubbish. It was a poem I wrote actually. A poem? Oh! RAMY: But maybe you're right. Maybe it's just waste after all. A poem of love interest? (River flowing) Don't let tears of sorrow inundate your thoughts, young man. They are like the-- the river current. The more you resist the stream of life, the more it makes you drown. (Birds squawking in distance) (Monitor beeps) (Shuts drawer) (Paper rustles) (♪♪♪) (Ramy sniffling) (Sniffles) (Speaks Arabic) HANI: When I moved to Canada, I apprehended the new world. Your mom was a foreign student at McGill. She wrote this poem as a welcome gift and to soothe my fears. As water ventures forth down a mountain, it dreams not of its origins as a fountain, nor fears its destination across the plain, but breaks free from all self-imposed restraint. Simple, and effective. Your mother excelled in English. She was a terrific language teacher. Keep it. It's now yours. A secret treasure. MAMA: As water ventures forth down a mountain, it dreams not of its origins as a fountain, nor fears its destination across the plain, but breaks free from all self-imposed restraint. Will there'll be sleepless nights? Absolutely. Will there be hard days? Will there be days where you think you're gonna have to give up? 100 %. But that is when you depend on yourself. But-- it's a big but. You must remember that you have to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.5. (Car whooshes) (♪♪♪) RAMY: Dear Baba, this is perhaps the most difficult letter that I will ever have to write, but there is something I must confess. (Paper rustles) RAMY: I couldn't find the courage to call you. I was afraid of your immediate reaction. I trust that you will respect my decision. Your son, Ramy.

(Chuckles) SOPHIA: Enjoy your night. ♪ Ridin' on backbitin' ♪ ♪ And get away with lies ♪ ♪ No matter what it takes ♪ ♪ Or who is gonna cry ♪ ♪ The only thing that matters ♪ ♪ Is you get what you desire ♪ ♪ But I know for sure, the day will come ♪ ♪ When you first realize what you have done ♪ ♪ And you finally get your debt repaid ♪ RAMY: Yaz, I haven't heard from you.

RAMY: Really? What did he say? HANI: He was really angry. Are you sure about this decision? I mean you've worked very hard to get here. (Thunder rumbling in distance) Have you even thought about your future? Yeah, aren't you gonna lose your chance to residency status here and shit? I'd rather lose my status than my mind. Hmm, makes sense. (Chuckles) Okay, Dave's here. I gotta run. Thanks for dinner, dad. I'll be back Wednesday. Hey, Tamer, tonight's your show at L'Esco, right? Yeah. (Drags chair) RAMY: Will Yaz be there? Are you mentally exhausted? (Sighs) Okay, listen, man, I'm gonna tell you something straight up and you're not gonna be happy with it, alright? I nailed Yaz more than a few times, okay? We were drunk, and it was something to do. And I'll tell you right now, she's the biggest pain in the ass you'll ever meet, okay? You get hooked on that chick, she's gonna make you wanna walk into the Saint-Laurent with concrete boots on. It's a catch. Want to go? Stay here. (Crowd cheering) TAMER: Is everybody having a good time? Ladies? Ladies, come on! Ooh! (Indistinct speech) Give it up for Dave on drums, Arno on bass! Do not feel like a Dirt bag! Come on! Wooh! (♪♪♪) TAMER: ♪ I try so hard, you put me down ♪ ♪ I gave you my heart ♪ Yeah, yeah. And more to you after party. Ramy. RAMY: I wanna talk to you. I'm busy. Ramy. Ramy. Hey! Oh, but-- dude! TAMER: ♪ Dirt bag, you go back home ♪ ♪ Dirt bag, just leave me alone ♪ Why do you keep giving me the silent treatment, Yaz? (Scoffs) Is that what you're here to discuss? Are you gonna be boring? Did you read what I sent you? The poem? Yeah. RAMY: And? YAZ: I thought it was nice. Clever. What are you hiding from then? YAZ: Fuck you, Ramy. I don't need your inquisition. I'm not one of your research projects. I felt something with you. Something new I've never felt. Sorry if that makes you feel like an experiment. So you want me to be exclusive to you? Is that it? Why should you get special treatment? Because we're from the same culture? The same background? I've been running away from that my whole life. I'm someone else here. Mysterious, exotic Yaz. What will she say? What will she do? Everyone wants to know. It's a full time job playing me. You ought to know. You're playing a role, too. But at least I'm the one who is in control. Nobody owns me or tells me what to do. (Takes deep breaths) YAZ: Don't be so naïve, habibi. Here. I wanna make you feel better. Let's take a trip together. I've already taken two of these. Kiss me, Ramy, or I'll swallow this one, too. (Pants) (Kissing) (Camera clicking) What the fuck are you doing? Can't you tell she's playing you, like she does with everyone else? Daring you with these dramatic games to gain the attention she so desperately craves. Mind your own fucking business, Désirée. All you care about is getting your own way. All you want are free headshots and... ...friends, like Rami and I. This is not a contest between one or the other. DÉSIREE: And you, Ramy, I thought you had a bit more consciousness. Depth maybe. Sense enough not to be lured in by an illusion of your own imagination. Désirée. Désirée! It's not what you think! (Vehicle whirring in distance) (Siren wailing in distance) RAMY: Hey, Dési. -DÉSIREE: Stay away from me. -RAMY: Wait. Wait! DÉSIREE: Leave me alone. (Siren wailing in distance) (Door opening in distance) ♪ Anwar sedated ♪ (Door shutting in distance) (Bangs the door) (Sighs) Rami, is that you? (Hani sighing) (Chuckles) What's goin' on with you? Where were you all night? (Sighs, chuckles) RAMY: If you knew where I was... (Sighs) All good. RAMY: Just met some people. Hmm. (Chuckles) (♪♪♪) (Shower runs) (Airplane whooshing in distance) Doctors failed to save my mother. At least if I fail at poetry, nobody is goin' to die. Why you're speaking to me in English now? You're coming back home with me. No. I'm not. BABA: What did you dare say to me? I'll be staying here to study literature. BABA: Literature. This is your life ambition now? To be a vagabond? I'd rather be a vagabond than a coward like you. Being a doctor was your dream, except you were too afraid of failure to pursue it. And so, you chose safety instead. And when mom was dying, it was left to me to comfort her, because you were too afraid of your own emotions.

Never too early to start, you sly dog. Thanks for letting me stay in your room all that time. Yeah, well you owe me big time. Listen, I um, need your help with some lyrics. Yeah, since you've been in your whole nuclear anarchy mode, you know what, I'd like for you to write me some before you get into any further trouble. Really? Yeah, really. (Takes a drag) And uh, you can stay here as long as you want. Dad could use the company. (Paper rustles) MAMA: Dear son, in the journey of life, find eternity in an instant. (Birds chirping in distance) (♪♪♪) MAMA: Live in wonderment as an infant. Allow your voice to become your freedom and your intuition your path to wisdom. In the presence of time, surrender to nature. Death and birth cohabit in a cycle. This is not my goodbye, just a farewell. And even though one day we will be apart, always remember to follow your heart. I will forever love you.

Call me "petit-bourgeois" and I'll kick your ass. What do you want? I'm late for work. (Flicks lighter) I'm having a reading tonight at Quai des Brumes. You comin'? Wow! Bohemian life.

What do you mean? I've discovered that I'm not meant to cure bodies with medicine, but hopefully to heal souls with my words. Désirée, I came here to thank you. (♪♪♪) DÉSIREE: I'm so glad you came. RAMY: I would not miss this for anything. After trying to cling desperately to some artificial sanity imposed by your own sense of dread, you realize that the only way to stay sane and survive is to let go of that construct. To fire the architect of fear, to stop building walls that prevent you from living life, however mad. To not fear angels or demons. But instead, to invite them both in for tea. You might learn that the angel is really a demon, or that the demon is really an angel. Or maybe that it doesn't really matter. 'Cause it's the chaos, the anarchy, the disorder that sometimes makes you feel like you've lived, and that perhaps you've loved. I would like to dedicate this to my muses. (Blows a kiss) (Crowd cheering and applauding) Wooh! (Yells) It's my cousin. It's my-- it's my cousin. It's my fucking cousin! It's my fucking cousin! (Tamer chuckling) TAMER: I'm so proud of you.

RAMY: (On video) You might learn that the angel is really a demon, or that the demon is really an angel. Or maybe... RAMY: (On video) That it doesn't really matter. 'Cause it's the chaos, the anarchy, the disorder that sometimes makes you feel like you've lived, and that perhaps you've loved. (♪♪♪) Well, it looks like you've got a fan. You ready? (Chuckles) RAMY: Your immaculate verses are as brave as your poet's heart. Who? Her. Her. This chick. What you doing? Get up! Go, go!
