Just take this main road and that's the 502. At ease private. I see you had a little trouble in basic. No, sergeant. Late to formation, sloppy quarters, uniform... I guess I had to adjust. We'll start over... clean slate. So, Private Winchell, what are you good for? Can you handle artillery? I don't know, Sergeant. - Ever shot a weapon before you went into basic? - No, sergeant. No BB guns, You didn't go hunting with your daddy? No, sergeant, my mother hates guns. But I think can handle it, Sergeant. We need an assistant gunner on a 40 mm grenade launcher, - It's a big weapon, but you're a big boy. - Yes, Sergeant. Here's the manual. One other thing. Any problems I should know about? Drinking, drugs, girls? No, Sergeant. Are you sure? This is where you want to bring your problems, not to your unit, not to the field. 'Cause I don't want to hear about it from the MP's. I used to go overboard with the alcohol. - Do you need counseling? - No Sergeant, those days are behind me. Ok. I'll be watching you. Go settle into your barracks, dismissed. So, basically, you're talking about robbing a bank? Which of course, you're an expert on, being the known and world famous mastermind criminal that you are. Get out, it's all the same guys. You get your account numbers; you go on line; you can transfer funds. I've seen people do it, I've seen millions get paid. Millions, you can't even retrieve fucking email! Gonna get fucked! Right? - Who are you? - Barry. Hey whattya know! It's Barry! Well, come in Barry, uh... I think he needs a beer. Get him a beer. You want a beer? Don't be dispirited, Barry. Just relax; take a few deep breaths; pop open a brewski; have a drink... Now Barry, I have one more question for you. You're Barry the fuck WHO? Winchell. - Robbin' a bank's the stupidest crime there is. - Is that so? - Highest rate of capture and conviction. - Ooh!! Who's the gangster now? Which bed is mine? It'd be that bed. Maybe you were hoping for something with a better view? The Deluxe Suite maybe? - Well, this is fucking ridiculous. I'm out of here. - Yeah, me too. - What? Where are you going? - Laundry, man. - Uh, why don't you stick around, Baker? - I gotta go call my girl, Fisher. You're such a pussy. Whoosh! Whoosh! Fuck you, baby. I told you, I don't call her twice a week, I get nothing when I go home. - Take it easy Barry... - Take care Barry... - Barry See you later. Hi. Hey! What? You can't read? No regulations against smoking in the barracks. You can't smoke in my room, Gomer Pyle. I'm allergic. Is that what all the medication's for? No dirty dishes in the sink. You don't use my towels. You will spray the shower stall with Lysol, every time you use it. You don't jerk off when I'm in the room, not even if you think I'm asleep, not even if you think I'm dead. When somebody asks your name, you say Winchell, not Barry. No first names in the Infantry. Not unless you want to everyone to think you're a pussy, or a mama's boy, or a no balls bitch, or just a plain garden variety asshole. Thank you. You'll find out, Barry, basic... it's one thing. Anybody can get through that. But the airborne infantry... it's where the army cuts the wheat from the chaff. Take care, Barry. What time is it? It's 09:00. - You're going to be late for formation. - Fuck! You are damned near late, Fisher! You are to fall in at 09:00! Is that clear, you little maggots? Where the fuck is Winchell? Who spearheaded the D Day assault? - Screaming Eagles, Sergeant. - You're not counting! 76! Who died on Hamburger Hill? - Screaming Eagles, Sergeant. - You're not counting! 77! Do you deserve to be called a Screaming Eagle? - No, Sergeant! - Why is that? - Because I'm an asshole, Sergeant! - A what? An asshole, Sergeant! - A what? - An asshole, Sergeant! You're not doing any pushups! - No sir! - Keep going, soldier! Yes sir! - How many is that? - 98! How many more you got? Two more! If you're lucky! I don't think you're going to make it, Winchell.

Where's our new kid? - You mean Winchell? - Yeah. Well, we beat him up pretty bad. Let's see if he's got what it takes! Hey Winchell. Is this too tough for ya?

Shut up, Baker! I'm guessing you boys are in from Fort Campbell this evening. - Are your tits real? - Justin! Don't worry sweetie, I'm used to people asking me all kinds of questions. I'm surprised you'd pay for being a little bit of a celebrity. - My buddy wants to feel them. - Why don't you shut up? What the fuck did you just say? - What, you didn't hear me? - Easy, boys. - Hey, what's your name, soldier? - Winchell - You've never been to a place like this before, have you? - No Ma'm. Don't tell me to shut up, bitch. I tell you to shut up. Hey, I think we'll need a time out here. - How about I take you on a little tour? - No, thank you. Alright, come on! Come on! The management is not fond of drunken fighting. You don't want them calling the MP's. Come on! Don't forget your mission, man. - I told you, it was a girl. - It's a man! Hey, Baker, you remember that old school shit? Break it, Crazy. Whoa! Get off the stage! This is my humble little dressing room. Take off your shirt. - Ex... Excuse me? - Ak, you smell like a brewery, soldier. You don't want the MP's stopping you on the way home smelling like that. What do you think of Visions? Different. Perhaps it's not your thing. Or perhaps you're not sure if it's your thing. Is that it? I thought you were the best one on stage. I bet you say that to all the girls, but thank you. - They are real. - Hmm? Your friend asked if they are real. He can be crude, I apologize. I see, you're a gentleman. One doesn't meet many of those here. Well, I was brought up to act a certain way around a lady. A lady? Correct. Oh, don't be coy. I'm sure tons of guys hit on you all the time. Look at you! I get a lot of attention, from some very weird people. Yeah, you poor stock super star. You ever shy? - Around half naked women. - Noo, don't get smart. - You're not very shy, are you? - Oh yes, I am. But I'm an actress. So I can pretend I'm anything. Confident, brazen, sexy. It's all a matter of projecting these qualities. So, what exactly is your mission? Yeah, I'm supposed to find out if... I'm supposed to find out, I mean..., how you learned to dance like that. ...were here tonight. Tonight... Well! What do we have here? Oh, a fresh fine thing in her dressing room. I am so sorry. We have to get ready for our second show. Oh, but you can stay sweetie. Help me dress, if you like. Yeah, I would, but My friends are waiting for me, sorry. Can I have my brush? Can I have your phone number? You never told me your first name. It's Barry. My phone number. You're under no obligation to use it.

I believe this is the gentleman I met Saturday evening. Do you remember my name? Of course I do. - Do you remember the mine? - I can't say it right now. I understand. - Who you talking to? - My momma So wha... what were you saying? What can I do for you, private Winchell? I need a change of scenery. I was wondering if we could get a cup of coffee. Well, I would like that. But, you saw me, uh, Saturday night in a show, with lights and stage make-up. - Yeah, so? What you saw on stage Saturday night is not the same creature you'll find having a cup of coffee on Wednesday evening. Look, I remember what you look like. You're pretty. - You always tell your mom she's pretty? - Yeah... hold on. I'm talking to my girlfriend from Kansas. She ran into my mom. I'm relaying a message. What were you saying? My neighbors are throwing a barbecue this evening. Well, is that an invitation? Yes, that's an invitation. Wow! Look at him. He cleans up real good. Go on! Be a hostess. He's here, and I'm in this awful top. Poise, voice, confidence... -I see you made it. - Military dress? It's my military training. You can take the girl out of the Navy, but you can't take the Navy out of the girl. - You look great. - Thanks Come on, I'll introduce you to my friends. Um, this is Lester and this is Ginger. - This is Barry. - Hi, nice to meet you, welcome. - Hey man. - Nice to meet you. - You dance at the club, right? - Yeah, I dance, sing, perform, whatever. - Yeah, in front of strange men. - Don't listen to him! - They're nice. - Ginger's kind of like my mentor. Come on, let's get you a beer. So, what do you do in the field? Just practice camping and sneaking up on each other? Yeah, we do that. We also get to launch TOW missiles. I qualified on my weapon last month. I made all my regs. Totally hit my marks. Now, when we gotta launch missiles, the Sarge wants me, 'cause I hit the target. Top gun. - So, you don't launch real missiles all the time? - Hell no! They're like $10,000 each. - You don't smoke? - No But I don't mind if you do. Seems to suit you. Why? Because I'm a redneck from Missouri? Under all this hair and makeup I'm just a piece of white trash from the hills of Tennessee. I like shit kicking country music and sometimes, when I'm home all alone, I eat baked beans right out of the can. What? You military? Navy was Where were you stationed? Saudi Arabia, in the Gulf War I managed a field hospital. All my training was about healing things. Yours is all about destroying things, and killing people. - I love the infantry. - Oh, I'm not criticizing you. You know, your freedom has a price. And the guys in my unit, we're the guys that pay that, with our lives. And I love them, - for that. - That's hot. In the navy, were you Calpernia? No. God, this humidity... wrecks my hair. - That's not funny. - I thought that you were hot? No? Does that cool you down at all? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I apologize. Let me clean that off you. Don't do it! Don't do it. - Fuck! - Ohh! Sorry Aw, it's all over ya. You're all wet. I better go clean my blouse, at home. Yeah, I should probably get... going back to base anyhow. I had a good time. I'm glad you came. Me too, thanks for inviting me. I'd like to see you again. Oh no, no, no. That's very nice. But the bars in Nashville are full of girls. Yeah, but you're not like the other girls. That's an understatement. - He wants to see me again. - And why shouldn't he? He's a straight boy, a handsome, gentle, mannerly straight boy, - with a job, and a car. - And he knows... I mean, you told him? - Cali! - I think he knows. Or he knows as much as he wants to know. What if he wants to make love? Does Lester pay attention to your, uh... My un-feminine boy parts? He ignored them for the first few years. And, then he started to experiment. But to me sexual orientation isn't black and white. I mean... very few people are 100% anything these days. Ginger, he's from Kansas. - This place sucks. - Fisher, come on, man. You're the one who dragged us here last week. Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.

Nobody knows who you're with or where you go. I'm just say... I am entitled to a private life that's separate from my army life. Well just so you know, Winchell, the army's not a normal job. We're supposed to live for each other, - and we're supposed to die to each other. - No Fisher. I mean people in the army they have families, careers, girlfriends. Right, Winchell, girlfriends, not some... mutant, from Visions. Who brought me to Visions in the first place? - Are you going to eat? Because your dinner is getting cold. - No, thank you. Thank you very much. You don't get it, Winchell, do you? This is the 101st Airborne Division: D-Day! Hamburger Hill! Those guys laid their lives down for each other. In combat! This isn't combat! Fuck you! Why did you do that? Are you crazy? Listen Fisher, I think we need to go down to mental health. Those pills you're taking are fucking up your head. I'm not fucking around! - You are going to clean it? - No, I'm not going to clean it! - Clean it! - No, I didn't make the mess. I'm not going to clean it! - Clean it! Are you going to clean it? - No - Clean it! - No... Get off me! I'm not going to fucking fight you! Jesus Christ! Oh shit! Shit, Winchell! - You alright? - Fuck off! - Go wash up, man. - Yeah man, go to the hospital. - To the emergency room, man. You're covered in blood! You got blood all over my fucking wall! What's wrong with you, Fisher? - Which way the fuck... - This is not going to pose problems. - Nothing happened, a fight, and no more. Shut the fuck up alright, now you guys just hang back. I'd like to be alone with Winchell for a second. Hello, can I get some attention please? Where the hell is everybody? Let me see this. - You know, I can get an article 15 for this shit. - Fuck! It's those fucking pills you take, man. - You mix them with alcohol. - I know, you're right. - they fuck up your mind. - You're right. You're right. Listen, Winchell, first thing Monday, I'm going to talk to somebody at mental health. I know I need help, man. I know I need help. I mean, they... people laugh... And you're the only one... that takes me seriously. I gotta fuck that shit up, man. Why do I gotta... fuck Why do I always gotta fuck shit up, man? Why I did I do that? Why did I do that? - Uh, Fisher, listen... - Stupid! - Hey, hey! I'm going to tell Diaz I threw the first punch. You'd do that for me? But my private life stays private. Yeah, yeah no problem. Everybody's entitled to a private life. Thanks Winchell. Can we get some help, here? Sometimes you kill me, Lester. - Hey guys - Hey Cal Want some brews? Here you go. Cal? This task has been performed correctly when the installation of SB3082V1/G2 and the completed maintenance forms have been inspected in accordance with performance measures 1 through 3 within 10 minutes. I think he's dangerous and you ought to report him. He's supposed to be dangerous. We're infantry. Here Dear mom and Wally, Here's my metal... I think you mean "medal" with a d. Yeah, fix it. I bet you always had girls doing your homework. My little cheerleader. Here's my medal for marksmanship. Wally you were right. The infantry's touff. "Tough" with a "gh"... But I can take it. I suck it up, and move on. I miss you guys, and love you so much. Barry Your family loves you. You're lucky. - This is a bad idea, turn around. - I just want to see the house that you grew up in. I swore I'd never come back here. I don't know why you're interested. You ask me questions all the time, about my mom, my old girlfriends. You have your secrets. - Like what ? - Like your birth father, you want to talk about him? He ran away when I was 4. I don't even know him. Ok, stop. - Don't get any closer. They might see us. - Cal, it's 6:00 in the morning. They get up with the roosters. Let's go knock on the door and say hello. No sir ! What are you doing? Get back in the car! Come on! Get back in the car! Barry? Jesus Christ! Get back! Was this yours? That's a boy's bike. Come on Cal, it'is your family. You can't live without... The first time I saw my mother, my hair was down to my shoulders, and I had been on hormones for a year. I thought I looked alright. I tried to keep the conversation flowing. That woman could barely speak. The tears were falling down her face, and she called me by my boy's name. I have to be more myself, before I walk up to that house again. What does that mean, you're supposed to more yourself? Please take me home. What's, what's this word? Orchidectomy That's removal of the male genitalia. - Va - Vaginoplasty That's where they, um create a vagina out of the penile tissues. I'm going to finish looking at this later. I know, it seems extreme. How much does it cost? Oh, up to $50,000. Jesus! $50,000! Do you know what you can get for $50,000? - You can get a Jaguar, a Porsche. - Uhh, I have a car. You don't need this. Let me show you something. Petty Officer Third Class (E4) Alberts: Scottie I've been running from that kid my whole life. Now, I just feel sorry for him. I'm tired of being a freak. Does that make me a freak if I'm in love with a freak? - But you said? - Yeah, I know what I said. - You know what really pisses me off? - What? You outrank me. That's right private (E3). I do. Yo Winchell!

Did you ever hear a ghost talk at night? I mean, they don't ever shut up. And not only that, you can hardly understand a word that they're saying. Well, my mom's really great. So, she pipes up and she says "Hey you ghosts, shut up in there." And that was it, I mean they just fell silent. My mom's great. Do you think a homosexual can be loyal to his unit? No, I, I don't see how a homosexual can be loyal. Because he'd always have this agenda to try and hump you, right? Right, I mean he'd always be trying to have sex with you, and stuff. - So, you should probably talk to Diaz about it. - Okay. Talk to him about what? Well about having homosexuals in our company. We do? One of the guys in our unit spends a lot of time at this club for deviants. Yeah? And I'm pretty sure that he gave someone fellatio, in that club. Well, well, tell me who it is. Because I, I can take care of that sort of thing. - I don't want to get any of my friends in trouble. - You don't want to get any friends... Okay, yeah I think I know who you're talking about. I mean, 'cause we're just talking, off the record, right? Okay, we're just talking off the record. Morning sergeant. Diaz, Glover's got something to say, I think you ought to hear. - Okay, soldier. - Yes, sergeant. Apparently, one of the men from our company attends a club that caters to deviants. Deviants? Sergeant, word is that he gave fellatio to a man in this club. You're saying that you saw someone from this company having sex with a man? No sergeant, Fellatio And I didn't see it, I just heard about it. So that makes it a rumor. In which case, you don't need to be spreading it. - Dismissed, Glover. - Yes, sergeant. Where is this club? - Nashville, First Sergeant. It's called Visions. - Dismissed, soldier! - Sergeant Close the door on your way out. Glover's a troubled kid. He's always running around telling tales. There's no problem in this unit. Oh, we got a problem in this unit, if there's a homosexual here. I say we find out where the boys have been spending their weekends. According to policy, you can be a homosexual and serve in the army, as long as you don't do anything that's homosexual or tell anybody about it. So, if you don't do anything homosexual and you don't tell anybody you're a homosexual, what makes you a homosexual? Does this policy make any sense to you? Come on, Diaz. You can't directly ask someone if he or she is gay. That's the policy. Directly Okay - Hey Baker. - How you doing, sarge? - How was your weekend? - Pretty good! Yeah, what'd you do? Usual shit, you know. Cruising with the boys; having beers; partied at The Wet Spot; giving all my money away to the strippers. - The fucking place is a gold mine. - Sure! Hey, you ever hear of this place, uh, I think it's in Nashville, called Visions? - Yeah - You ever been there? - I was there once. Yeah? What's it like? It's all fucking perverts, sarge. I never went back. Yeah, who else went with you? I mean you didn't go alone right? Fuck no, sarge. I didn't even want to go there in the first place. I'm done lifting here. So, I was going to go do some cardio. Look, uh, like I said, sarge, once I found out what kind of place it was, I mean, I never went back. If it wasn't your idea, who's idea was it? It was one of fucking Fisher's hair-brained ideas, you know, It was just a gag, sarge, you know it's, uh, just a little fucking goofy. Just went there, laughed at the fucking weirdos. Okay, Baker, okay, thanks You've been talking shit about me. What? You've been talking shit about me. No, I haven't. Fuck, Fisher I'm going to get my ass kicked out of the army. This is my life man, this is my career. I mean, do you think... - you think this is funny? You think this is some fucking joke? - Hey, hey, calm down. Don't tell me to calm down! Just relax, Winchell. Jesus! - I think it's Glover... - Glover? ... got a grudge against you. - You put him up to it. - No, I didn't. - Yes you did, you were there. - I was where? Visions! So was Baker, so was Martinez It was you, fucker, you started this whole thing for some sick reason. Hey don't forget man, I kissed a person in that place. If I was starting rumors about you, I'd be starting rumors about myself. - Does that make sense? - No I, I don't know, but, somehow you worked it so that you could stay clean and all this shit comes down on me. You drink too much, man. You want to hear some really weird shit? When I was little, about two or three, my mother and my sisters used to dress me up in girls' clothes. I remember them doing this. And one time when I was twelve, I got busted for some shit at school and they strip searched me. And they found out I was wearing my sister's panties. Is that fucked up or what? - Are you trying to be funny? - Nobody else knows this... ...but you. You're the only human being... ...just you. You're my battle buddy. Who helped you get through the first few weeks? You did. And who helped you qualify on your weapon? - You - That's right. You need to stick with your friends. You want me to help you study for Soldier of the Month? Yeah, okay Stay loyal to your brothers. -I'm here for you, man. - Alright I mean, how many people, out there in the world, would really lay down his life for you? How many people will say that? "I will lay down my life for you." This squad is the best in the company. What about that fight he had with Fisher? Yeah, what was that all about? Winchell's come a long way. Let it rest. - ...too, why did you go to the club? - Wait, are you asking me if I'm gay? Oh that's quite a label. I did not use that word. No, I was talking about a club. Why you went there, why you encouraged others to go. Well, is this the thanks that you get trying to help a friend? Sergeant, it's complicated. People my age, we're really trying to find ourselves. Aha, You jerking me around, Fisher? No, sarge What about that fight between you and Winchell? Huh? What was that all about? I threw the first punch, sergeant. Fisher was getting on my nerves. I told you that. That's right. How about it Winchell? You ever been to this uh, this club for deviants called Visions? Yeah, Fish took me. Comes back to you, Fisher. Does it, sarge?

First part was that we scoped the place out, right? You got, you got to shop it. Because if I was going to rob, rob a bank, I'd definitely want Glover on my side. Wouldn't you, guys? Finish your story. It's a good story. - It's a good story. - So the first place had been robbed before. And I knew that, because it had bulletproof glass. Oh! He's in for it... ...who signed on for that? - I mean, - Holy moly Batman, - It's tight -bulletproof glass! you're not going to get more than $3,000 out of it.

Personnel on this military base are reeling, from a deadly assault that occurred here last night. The information we have, at this moment, is that Private First Class Barry Winchell, was attacked under mysterious circumstances, at approximately 1:00 A.M. He was taken first, by ambulance, to the hospital on post, then transferred by helicopter to University General, where surgeons worked frantically to revive him, but without success. I've been told that Winchell had massive head trauma, and his parents have authorized him being removed from life support, just minutes ago. That's all we have to date on this story. We'll keep you up to date on it, as details become available. Back to... Cali, oh my God! I just heard on the news. They killed him! They killed him! The 911 system was down. So the boys tried to call and um... You seem to be upset, sergeant. I am upset. I'm very upset. I lost one of my best soldiers. The emergency system is down. The emergency system is down. Nobody can call for help? Aw that's, that's rich. That's convenient. You tell me why it takes an ambulance one hour, one hour to get someplace? Winchell was still alive. I don't remember mm! Am I going to get kicked out of the army for this? Yeah, I showed him the bat. I mean, it's, it's a, it's a good bat. It's a great bat. It's vintage. It's the kind of bat that you show people. But if he's telling you that I meant for him to kill Winchell, that's, that's bullshit. You're the person that Time magazine referred to as Winchell's cross dressing friend? Yes. I was his friend. We were supposed to spend the weekend together. We're family. This is a death in the family. Did you hear anything about him being harassed or being called names? He never complained about it. He was Airborne Infantry. When you're Airborne Infantry, you don't complain. The imagination is the most powerful force known to mankind. And it is my imagined self, the one who is beautiful, and loving, and worthy of being loved, that has been my guiding force, my inspiration. I can only hope to become the person Barry imagined me to be.
