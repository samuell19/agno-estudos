Ouch! Doctor! I told you, I can't lift it any higher. It's your rotator cuff. - You need an osteopath. - A what? It's your rotator cuff, you need an osteopath. Someone to manipulate it manually. I can't do much. No injection? That's just palliative, anti-inflammatory. Do it anyway, as long as the pain goes. 100 euros. 100 euros? I don't have it on me. If I can work I'll pay you at month's end. Promise! They'll do it free of charge at the E.R. I have to clock on at the yard at six. I tell you what, go to the E.R., come home, rest for a few hours, then go to work. Don't joke! Help me out. You've a nice face, I can tell you're a decent person. Really? Then while you're at the E.R., get an eye doctor to look at your eyes. You don't mean it? Can't we come to some agreement? New blender? Yeah, I've just stolen it. SOS DOCTOR - ROUND THE CLOCK - Yes? - Another call. Six-month-old baby. No! I know. I know... I'll send you the address. And please, Pier, behave yourself. Bye. DOCTOR ON CALL Yes? Mai. Sorry? Dr. Mai. Ground floor. Through the garden on the right. Thanks for coming. This way. In here. - Sorry for the mess. - Don't worry. Toys! Here. Darling! - At last! - Honey, the doctor. - Good evening. - Good evening. Shall we go in the bedroom? Not with all that mess! Let's put him on here. - On the table? - Yes. It's covered in germs! Disinfect it first. - There. - Right. Quick! His name's Gioele. - Nice name. - Thanks. - There. - Can you give me a hand? Yes, of course. - There you are. - Don't make a draught. Come here, little one. - Mummy's darling. - What are his symptoms? - He's been coughing. All day. - He's gasping for breath. Don't worry, Gioele. He's a good doctor. It won't take long. It'll soon be over. Daddy loves you. - Mummy loves you too. - Yes, Mummy does too. - Be brave. - We went to the paediatrician. It took her literally a minute. "Use a nebuliser." And that was it! But he still not breathing right, he's gasping for air. See? She said it was just laryngitis. Absurd! What is it? Just laryngitis. Use a nebuliser. - That's 150 euros, please. - Are you sure? - It's always been 150 euros. - No, I meant... - I read if it's croup... - Where did you read that? - What? - The word "croup"? Online. Okay... Ten drops before going to bed. Thanks. A tranquillizer for such a young baby? It's not for him. Don't worry, Gioele. Time flies. You'll soon be 18. Goodbye. I know the way. - Hi. - Hey. I've brought... a giraffe for Chiara. This is a blender. It might come in useful. - Come in. - Thanks. The party ended two hours ago. Sorry, but you know what my work's like. Chiara? She's just dropped off. Pity, I'd have liked to have seen her. - Do you want a drink? - No, thanks. I can't, I'm on duty. It was a nice party. All her little friends came. Yes. Maybe next year then. I haven't eaten yet. If you're hungry, there's some lasagne left. Thanks, but... I've just received... a text. - It won't take a second to heat up. - I have to go. You know what my job's like. Next time. Bye. First course? Pasta and beans? I'll pass, nothing too heavy. - What are your main dishes? - The usual things. Oxtail stew, beans with pork rinds, meatballs in tomato sauce, lamb chops. For something lighter, escalopes in lemon. Ah! Escalopes in lemon! I'll have oxtail stew to start and then as a main dish meatballs, your own recipe. Side dish? Can't you see? Roast potatoes. Aubergines, spinach... - Beans with pork rinds. - As a side dish? Yes, to go with the meatballs. - Are you sure you're a doctor? - Of course. Yeah. - Susy! - We've had a complaint. - From whom? - Mrs Giuffrè. - The one with the tranquillizers. - Mrs Giuffrè? She needs opiates! She smelt booze on you and wanted to report you. I haven't touched any alcohol in 28 days. Got that? You threw up on a patient's foot last Monday, remember? That's normal, it's a side effect. I take pills for my bad back. It can happen. I was on the phone for ages persuading her not to. Good. Thanks. No, it's not good! Will you start behaving more responsibly? What the fuck! You sound like my ex-wife when you do that. No way! I'd never have married a guy like you. I have to go, I'm busy. Wait! You have to take the prescription to Mr Ferrantini. Me? Can't you find someone else? You're the only one on duty. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, you there! You can't come in here with that. You're right, but I've had two stolen this last month. And I'll smash the third one. You'll have to wait, the kitchen was about to close. - I'll wait outside then. - Good. Okay. Sorry, I knocked over... Leave it, I'll pick it up. Sorry. Geez... Hi. - Hello. - What's your name? - Mario. - Nice name. - Thanks. - What's your job? I'm a rider, I'm self-employed. You deliver food, a delivery boy. Yes. How much do you earn? Five euros a delivery. Then it depends on the distance... It suits me. Do you want to earn 10 euros in three minutes? I don't know... Come on! I want you to deliver this... You have to use the app. And I'm waiting for some food. You're just catching cold. It's simple. I know, but... Three minutes, that's all. I have a patient who lives nearby. You take him this prescription, he'll pay you 50 euros, bring it back to me and I'll give you 10 euros. - Dr. Pierfrancesco Mai... - Yes, I'm a doctor. I don't know, I'm waiting for... It won't take a second. The address is on the back. My number's on it if anything happens. - It's back here, right? - Yes, he's a nice person. Okay I'll be right back... - I'll tell them... - Thanks a lot. - You've gone for a wee... - I'll be quick. - Well done. - I'm off! Good. The oxtail's delicious. Is the oven on? Warm up a flat bread for me. Good evening, I've got your prescription. Excuse me. Excuse me! You have to... Forgive me... Mr Ferrantini? Hello? Excuse me! Where's he gone? I'm here! I need... 50... I'm ready. The beans and pork? God... I have to die of something. In my restaurant? Aren't you glad I chose you? I prefer you. Who's this? - Hello. Who's that? - Doctor. - It's me, Mario, the rider. - Everything okay? - Are you coming back? - No. I've handed over the prescription. But there's a little problem. - Where are you? - Hiding in the bathroom. - In the bathroom? - Yes. The old man needs... an injection. He seems a nice person. - I didn't like to say no. - Then do it. - I don't know how to! - What? It's only an injection! I can't! Lie the patient down... And stick it in! No! He's already lying down. He's pulled his trousers down too. Okay, wait there. - I'm on my way. - Okay! Jenny, do me a favour. Put the meatballs in a doggy bag. I spoke to a colleague, he's on his way over. I've hurt my hand, unfortunately, and... You need a steady hand to give injections. You never know... You can pull your trousers up for now. Sir? Sir? Sir. Sir? Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God, he's dead! Oh my God! My fingerprints in the bathroom. Oh God! Oh my God! What? Sir! Oh my God! Have you been to Ferrantini's? You've another call. Did you hear me? - Oh God! - Pier? What the fuck... Is everything okay? I'll call you back... Oh God! Now what? - Hey. - Oh God! - You ran into me! - What a tragedy! - What? - The old man's not moving. - What? - He's dead! - What do you mean? - I didn't even touch him. Or I did, but he was already dead. I've removed all the evidence. No one will know I was there. Doctor. You left your bag behind. He's alive! He's alive! Of course! Good evening. Forgive me, it happens sometimes, it's my age. These things happen. But, you're not the same doctor. No, he's my trainee. He helps me out, but he has to go now, he has another case... My 10 euros? Here you are. No... Because we have... I'll be right there. I'm coming. Ferrantini. I'm here for your injection. I'm ready. Oh no! That's 100 euros. It's usually 50. Prescription and injection. Can you get that? I'm a little slow. Bloody hell! All right, I'll go. You could have just said no. Coming! I was going to go but I have a bad back... Coming! It's for you. Me? - What? - My bicycle. - Well? - It's broken. 10 euros won't repair it. How'll I do my deliveries? Deliveries? What deliveries? It's just... medicines my colleague here delivers. Wait. Thank you, Ferrantini. My compliments. You've still got a firm body. There! Someone else is doing my delivery. I can get in trouble over this, you know. - You've lost the job of the century. - Maybe. But I need it. So much for going there and back in ten minutes. Just look at the state of my bike. - Can we contact the insurance? - I tell you what. I'll give you 50 euros and then piss off. We're sorted. Goodbye. Goodbye. Do... do you need a hand? - To do what? - The injection. - I thought you didn't know how. - Yes. But you're here now, you can explain how it's done. I used to be able to reach. But now... Go on... try it. Try it, here. This is the syringe. - Disinfect it with this cotton wool. - Okay. I'll point to the right place. Be relaxed but determined. Don't forget, perpendicular. Perpen... what? Fuck, didn't you got to school? Perpendicular. First the cotton wool, right? Yes, give it a good rub. - Come on! - Shall I? - Go on! - Shall I? Go on, fu... What happened? What have you done? - You caught a nerve! - You didn't tell me there was one! You caught something! I can't move my leg. - You can't? - It's blocked. Shall I call someone? No! Call who? Leave it. Now what? INCOMING CALL SUSY You answer it. Do me a favour. Press that. Where were you? Pintucci wants to talk to you about Mrs Giuffré. Did you tell him? We have to report all complaints. Though I know you don't like rules. - When you come off shift... - I can't finish it. - Are you drunk again? - No! It's my bad back. It's a long story. Listen, I'll send you the next address, have a couple of coffees then get back to work or Pintucci will fire you. For real! - You see? - What? Yeah, what? Can no one replace you? Who? What? Is there no other way? I don't feel up to it. We've already discussed it. Come on, damn it! You owe it to me! It's your fault I can't walk. Go on! What a pain! Are you sure it'll work? Yes, as long as you don't talk bullshit. - Yes? - Delivery. Fuck! We're off to a good start! - Eh? - I meant, Dr. Mai. Third floor. You're really sure? Don't worry. Go on. What if I get arrested? With my face no one will believe I'm a doctor. You won't get arrested. At least, not because of your face. But try to look the part. Okay? I'm... Migraine! I'm sorry, you might have... - Testing. - Good evening, doctor. I'm sorry I'm late. I've just arrived from a conference in Geneva. We doctors... - Don't worry. Come in. - Thank you. May I? You've got a lovely place here! Thank you. This is great! I had one when I was a kid. Let me try. I'm a bit rusty. I'll try again as a matter of principle. Doctor, if you don't mind, I've got a terrible stomach ache. Of course! Okay then... If that doesn't work, feel his stomach to see if it's swollen. Have you got that? Understand? - Can I wash my hands? - The first on the right. Thanks a lot. Okay. - Say it again, the sound's bad. - Where from? - I've been talking for an hour. - From "feel", I think. Let's start again. Tell him to lie down, ask what his symptoms are, then repeat it out loud. Okay. Then what? I'll tell you what to do. You keep calm and smile. I love the bathroom too. It's full of... tiles. Here we are. - Well? - Well what? Say "ninety-nine". Why? I thought it was something... Tell me what's wrong. How... what... I have painful cramps in my stomach. Stabbing pains, doctor... So you're feeling these painful cramps in your stomach, stabbing pains? Don't shout. Not so loud. Or he'll realise. You feel these painful cramps, you were saying. Annoying stabbing pains. But don't whisper, either. - Talk normally. - In short, your stomach hurts. Yes. - How long's it been hurting? - How long's it been hurting? At least three days! Wow! That's a long time! - Ask if he has problems with gas. - Have you problems with gas? - Gas? - Yes. Arrears, unpaid bills. What are you saying? What am I saying? - Problems with flatulence! - If you don't know. - Air! - I meant air, flatulence. Gas, of course! I'm a doctor. No, no gas. - Any fever? - Any fever? No, no fever. That's good! Excellent. Congratulations! - Yeah, happy birthday! - You don't need me. Ask if he has to push hard when opening his bowels. I have to ask you something... That is, if you want to answer... Do you have to push hard when opening your bowels? Yes, I do, but nothing happens... Tell him to go to the hospital to get it unblocked. What do you think it is, doctor? What is it? That's a good question! What do you think it is? What are you saying? He's got a blockage. You've got a blockage. - You have to go to hospital. - No, no! Can't you help me? It's very painful. Last time the nurse freed me in two seconds. I see, it's not his first time, he's a repeat offender. If it only takes two seconds let's help him, right? Yeah, two seconds. Are you talking to me? Of course, who else? I'm not stupid! - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm here to help you. Thank you, doctor. Really. You're an angel. They keep me waiting ages at the hospital. Two seconds, right? I've got a call. - May I? - Yes, it'll take us two seconds. Hello? I'm a doctor. - Doctor! - Doctor? - Shall I take my T-shirt off too? - I'll be right back. He's getting undressed, what do I do? That's the least of your problems. - There are some gloves in my bag. - Okay. - What do I need gloves for? - To blow them up like a balloon? The patient has an impaction. A faecal blockage. I don't understand these big words. What must I do? It's not a big word. You put the glove on and stick your finger up his arse. Ready, doctor? Did you find the gloves? Here, disinfect your hands. Oh crikey! That was disgusting! Well, you asked for it. Admit it. No. No! - What? - I'm off. I'm not cut out to be a doctor. That sort of thing disgusts me. It's very rare to come across something like that. Wow, so I'm a lucky boy! It's usually nothing. If someone has a serious problem, I could do some damage. A serious problem? You don't get those! A bout of influenza, an injection... Impacted faeces! I told you to send him to the hospital. He'd have been fine. Come on! - I'll get fired. - You can come and work with me. How? We have riders your age. I believe you. I'm not a hundred years old! No, we'll go 50-50. I'll pay you like a doctor. Half a doctor. I'm an awful liar. I mess up. No! - Do you have a family? - No. I do. Go on! Where are you going? We have to wait for another call. Let's go to Chowa's while we wait. - Who's Chowa? - It's a Japanese restaurant. - I want to help, but I can't lose money. - Okay, let's go to Chowa's. - How's your back? - Painful. Really painful. Okay. Here he is! - Good evening. - Is it all there? One... and two. Wait a second. But... Where are my lobster rolls? What lobster rolls? Did you eat them? No. Of course not. Yes... you've eaten them. - I'm fooling. - Okay. Let's check everything's here. - Can you smell that? - What? Open your mouth. Why? I want to see if you're lying or not. You'll have pieces of lobster between your teeth. I mean it. Open your mouth. Come on! Open your mouth! Fuck, he opened his mouth! I'm taking the piss. But you're cool. I've no change, sorry. - Bye. - Goodbye. Oh! Here. I've found two euros. - Thanks. - Throw this out too. I emptied the cat litter. That's what stunk. He opened his mouth. Hello? Hey. Back any better, Pier? No. And my name's Pierfrancesco. - Are you still pissed off? - Yes. I can't always take the blame. I usually save your ass. But I'm not your carer. You've another call. Some people are idiots. - Who's that? Are you with someone? - No. - It's the radio. - He made me throw out some poo... It's the radio... Tell me where to go. Via Crispolti, 41. I'll text you the rest. Okay. Bye. - You're a good driver. - Thanks. You've a good aim, you hit all the bumps. - There are so many of them. - But you don't miss a single one. - Does it hurt if I touch you here? - Bro, it kills like when I'm peeing! - It kills like when you're peeing. - That's what I said, yes. - Yes. - Feel his side. And don't let him call you "bro". You're a doctor. - Would you mind calling me doctor? - Right. Thanks. What about here? Bro, keep those hands still. It's killing. - It's gravel, bro. - It's gravel. - What's that? - You're asking too much there. It's sand in the kidneys. Gravel. It's sand in the kidneys. Gravel. Have you been to the beach lately? It's winter. Why would I? To build sandcastles! What else? Give him an injection of Toradol. He'll be fine. I'll have to give you an injection. It's in my bag, all ready. With a red cap. I'm scared of injections. - Do you have a steady hand? - Really steady. Sure! - Are you sure? - Yes. Won't be a sec. I'll disinfect it. Ready with the syringe. Don't hit a nerve. - What's up? - Nothing, it's just... You have an unusual buttock, I have to concentrate. Okay. One... Did you get the money? - No. - No, what? No, I'm choosing which buttock... It makes no difference. Go on. He's a student. Ask him to pay you, I don't trust him. You have to pay in advance. - Otherwise... - Don't worry. Give me the injection and I'll pay. If he won't pay in advance, tell him to go to the E.R. He can go and queue up and they'll give it him free of charge. If you don't pay in advance, you have to go to the E.R. What's the point? You're here now! Hurry up, I'm in a load of pain. Okay. Right. One. Don't do it. Don't fall for it. - Two. - Two... Come on! Go ahead and give me this injection. - He won't pay you! - Go on, doctor. - And... - Mario! Three! You okay? Can you move your leg? Just fine. Thank you, doctor. Just fine! You're a bloody idiot. That's 100 euros. - Oh, right. - Yes. I don't have it on me. I thought I had cash, but... I'll pay you tomorrow. You see! He doesn't have it! How strange! Doctor! We're from the same place. If we don't help each other out... Caserta province? Santa Maria Capua Vetere. Santa Maria Capua Vetere? I was born there. - Really? - Yes. - Do you know Peter Grant? - Not seen him in ten years! We've been friends since we were this high. Does he still have two dogs? - One died. - I'm so sorry! Say hello to him! Sure! So it's agreed then, I'll pay you tomorrow. I promise. See if there's anything interesting to take away with you. But not a blender. Is that a toaster? No, a ukulele. Bit out of tune, but good. There's no market for that. What would we do with that? - He was in pain, what could I do? - Like I said. Send him to queue up at the E.R. like everyone else. But he found an idiot like you and took advantage. Don't offend me. - You're a naive idiot. - I've enough with Dad saying that. He'll have his reasons. I'd rather be a naive idiot like me than a cynic like you. It was only an injection. It can't cost much. It cost us 100 euros! Either the patient pays for the injection or they make me pay for it. In this case, us, because you're my partner. I find that absurd. We have to help those in need. I would but I can't afford it. What the fuck can I do? Why do you do this job? At night too? You could work in a hospital maybe or open a surgery. I worked abroad for many years and when I came back I was sixty and this is all I could find. You can't be fussy at sixty. Where abroad? Africa. In Africa? That's cool! How come? I went to visit a doctor friend of mine there. He worked in Mozambique. I went for a week, a kind of holiday. Then once there... I saw the difficulty the people were in, children, sick people... They're short of everything, water, facilities... I stayed for six months. Only six months, then what? I came home. Intending to stay. But after a while, you know... Perhaps the African bug... I went back there. Except this time I stayed for 30 years. Half my lifetime. 30 years, wow! Why did you come back to Rome? Is your family here? Do you want my life history? Do you want to write a book? I want to know you better. For example... Why do you mumble sometimes? I can't understand you. Mumble... because I take these pills. For my backache, that you brought on. - But you take them with whisky! - Behave. I'm the doctor, I know how to treat illnesses. Phone. Anna, what's up? Nothing. I don't even know why I called you. It's just... I can't sleep. I needed to talk to someone. Chiara woke up and asked for Carlo. She's been asking all day. I'll come over. I'll be right there, wait for me. Hello. Who are you? I'm Dr. Mai's assistant. He's downstairs in the car, he can't move with his back. He used to think up better excuses. It's not an excuse, he's in pain. He did try. It's my fault, I caught a nerve. - But I'm already improving, so... - Have you come to tell me he's sick? He told me to give you this. Ten drops. To help you sleep. She sent you this and said hide it. - Can you hear that? - Yes. That's what a healthy heart should sound like. - A young man's heart. - That's incredible. I used to love this thingy as a kid. It's an interesting object. Now listen. You should hear a different beat now. It's different. Of course, it's mine. It's more laboured. A much older person who drinks and eats. And smokes? No, I've never smoked. But I'm from Milan and the pollution... And everyone smoked when I was a kid. They smoked at home, at the cinema... - On planes. - In restaurants, everywhere. - Your daughter's pretty. - Who? The one with the drops. What's her name? Anna. No. She's my son's ex-wife. Yes, pretty. - Are we going? - Yes! - Come on! - Okay. I'll go. Be careful, eh? Don't worry. Do you remember everything? Check lungs, send photos of ears, nose and throat. - What if he has a fever? - I don't remember. Check the flexibility of the neck to rule out meningitis. I told you six times! Don't get angry, I've only been a doctor for three hours. Come in. Wow! Have you lived here long? Since 1800. My great-great-grandfather built this building. Was he a bricklayer? I'm joking. Very witty! Well done! - My daughter Costanza! - Nice to meet you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Hello. What's your name? Michelangelo. What an important name! Like the Ninja Turtles? No, like my poor husband. Deceased. You see? The bricklayer was enough. Don't make quips. Right... Goodness! Have you taken his temperature? Yes, it was 38.2 an hour ago. Take it again. Right... Are you taking it or not? Stick 'em up! - Twenty-two? - Twenty-two? That's strange. Fucking strange! Try it again, nearer his forehead. I always play this game. Right. 38.4. Great! It's not meningitis! Give me five! No, 38.4, give me four! Four, eh? Good evening. Good evening. - Is everything okay? - Yes, great. - My daughter's husband. Carry on. - Okay. Michelangelo. Now we'll listen to your lungs. Lift this up. Let's listen to these lungs. Breathe in. Wait... Wait a sec. What are you doing? Okay, it's as I thought. You've got the lungs of a champ! Don't worry, he doesn't smoke. I'm joking. He does. Mum! - Have you checked his throat? - Oh, right. - Yes, look at his throat. - I wanted to see his throat. Open your mouth. Say "aaahhhh"! What are you doing? Listen, I can't work like this. Are you a doctor? Surgeon. Oh, a surgeon. That's all we needed! Say as little as possible. Michelangelo gets upset when his father examines him. Last time his heart was accelerated. He's making mine race too. Michelangelo gets agitated a lot. That's because you're always scolding him. At least I don't spoil him like you do. Please, go ahead. Well, the pharynx isn't swollen. Forget the nose and send me one of his ears. Okay, I'll put this in... Excuse me... what's with the telephone? My light's broken... on the thingy, here. - The... - Otoscope. Mario, don't let him intimidate you! Be confident. You're trembling. Are you okay? Have you ever done an ears nose and throat examination? - Lodovico, please! - It's these doctors on call! Lodovico, get out! What? Can't I even stay in the same room now? - I'm his father. - Enough! What? - I can't work like this. - What are you doing? You know, Michelangelo. My father had little consideration of me too. He never caressed me or paid me a compliment. But then... the day I graduated he came up to me and said, "I'm sorry, Mario. I was wrong not to believe in you." And he hugged me. That day will arrive for you too, champ. Hang in there. Nice story. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye? Where are you going? Wait! Oh no! Now you're for it! I was wrong, I owe you an apology. I'm good with kids, just not my own. A father's redemption. Let's go back in. I want you to examine Michelangelo in peace. The kid's got an ear infection. Get the prescription pad. Take it easy. He's got an ear infection. - His ear? - Yes. Here. Thanks. - Here. - Thanks. You did really well. I'll be honest, you surprised me. And you can also... tell good lies. - Well done. - It was all true actually. Except for the last bit. - What's that? - The positive bit. The part where he hugs me. It's not easy being a father. Or a son. Especially if your father's always calling you an idiot. Maybe he does it... - To spur you on... - Maybe. I mean... - Perhaps you're a bit too... - Stupid? No, too kind. And maybe he was trying to... Yes. You need qualities to be a father. You're not born one. - You learn as you go. - Yes. What about your son? When did he die? How do you know? I was thinking... that no father gets along with his son's ex-wife. Unless... he's dead. I didn't... I didn't even have a good relationship with Anna when Carlo was alive. - So... - When did it happen? - Cut it out... - Fine. You don't want to talk about it. Let's go. At least you could've told me if Anna's single. Fuck off! I will, but I have a delivery first. Thanks. - Good evening. Thank you. - Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Who's the patient? Okay. - Can you hear it pumping? - Yes, it's pumping. - Listen! - Go on! Diastolic pressure 80. That's perfect. You're fine. I'll take yours if you want. Next time maybe. Yes, of course. Good evening, doctor. I used to do your job. Say, "Aaaah!" Say, "Aaaah!" Doctor? - Doctor? - Yes? Yes. Doctor! Doctor! Did you drop off? No, it just looked like it. I was concentrating on your heart rate. Here we are. See? Nothing to worry about. Just an allergic reaction. - Shall we take a selfie? - Yes. Say, "paracetamol"! Paracetamol! Perhaps your father was right. You're such a fool! - That's strange. - What is? I think I've been here before. Good evening, doctor. Come in. Are you okay? Yes, I'm just great. Just a bit of a headache. What accent's that? Can I use the toilet? Of course. Over there on the left. - Thanks. - You're welcome. What's going on? Oh God! Oh God! - What accent is that? - Dunno. Sardinian! I'm in the home of the guy who made me throw the cat's poo out. Did he recognise you? No, I was wearing a cap before. Get out of there. Ok. Darn it! Fucking cat! Doctor! Is there a problem? I don't know, you tell me. Have you got... a problem? I don't think so. Are you sure? Yes, I just called you for an emergency. What kind of emergency? I wanted to go skiing tomorrow but I've used up all my holidays. This guy's a fool, get out of there. So I need a doctor's note, if you don't mind. - You consider that an emergency? - Yes. Freshly fallen snow is an emergency! Find a little something wrong with me. Your colleagues always do. - Let's sit on the sofa. - Don't do it. Get out of there! - I'll give you a good examination. - All right. Why? Why? Say ninety-nine. - Why? - Do you want to teach me my job? - No. - Say ninety-nine. Ninety-nine. Open wide. Up. Say, "aaah!" Cough. Cough! Cough louder. - What the... - What are you doing? Have you had any blood or urine tests done lately? - Urine tests? - This needs looking into. What needs looking into? Yes, but I don't think they're much use, because I... I always keep an eye on things. Tell him: "Everything's fine. That's right, well done," and leave. Believe me, these are recent. There's nothing wrong. I look at the ranges. - If you look at the values... - I can read, thank you. Okay. - Oh dear! - What? Who looked at these results? - Are you stupid? - What do you mean? What are you getting into? You'll get me in trouble. - Hello? - You'd better stay home tomorrow. - Hello? - Why? What an idiot! - The person you are calling... - Darn it! Listen, there's no easy way to say this, so I'll say it quickly. Because time is precious and we mustn't waste it, okay? Your sugarotomicine levels are rather high. - Sugar... - Otomicine. It's obvious. From your breathing problems. - I don't have breathing problems. - Your breath... forgive me, but... It stinks like a carcass. - A carcass? - A corpse! - Is that serious? - It can be very serious. - Very serious? - Don't despair. Be thankful you met me. I'm an expert. - I've treated thousands of cases. - Good. - And even saved a dozen. - Just a dozen? In the meantime get a colonoscopy done. - A colonoscopy... - While you're awake. Anaesthetic gives false results. - When do I have to do them? - At dawn. Get on the phone and pay up. Don't be mean. As my Grandma said, "There's no point being the richest man in the cemetery." Goodbye. By the way. That's 200 euros. This is your share. What have you done? I prescribed a colonoscopy. He deserved it. Fuck, you prescribed a colonoscopy in my name, in Sardinian? I didn't want him to recognise me. I had to do something, you told me not to be an idiot. That's right, when you're yourself, not when you're me! He called us out because he wanted to go on holiday, while we're in disreputable areas at night saving lives! What are you talking about? Whether you like it or not, this city needs us. It's full of people in danger, who are really sick, not like him! He's just an idiot who wants to go skiing! He's not sick! And you're not a doctor! Are you? Yeah? 60 year-old-woman, Probably food poisoning. Where? - Via Tiburtina. - Number? 274. We're on our way. Who's we? We... In the sense... the royal "we". You know. If there's only one person in the ambulance, we say "we". Even if it's one. Why do you have to poke your nose in? Mind your own fucking business! Why am I still working with someone like you? Oh, fuck off! Good evening. May I? I'm in here, doctor. Come in. Everything okay? Here I am. - Good evening, doctor. - Good evening. Well, how do you feel? I don't know what's wrong. I feel really weak. I feel nauseous. I keep throwing up. - I've got the runs. - Don't worry. Lie down now. - Ask her what she's eaten. - What have you eaten? What have I eaten? Not much. A bit of lasagne. Four lamb ribs. Chicory tossed in oil. - Delicious. - A piece of mozzarella. - An ice-cream. - Holy shit! And a mandarin orange. It must have been that. Tell her to drink and get some sleep. Ask if she has a lock. What for? To put on the fridge. Don't worry, it's nothing serious. Drink a lot of water. I'll get you a glass. Where's the kitchen? Over there. Thanks. Just a sec. Is food poisoning contagious? I'm starting to feel a little strange too. Did you have dinner with the patient? Eh? It's not contagious! I'll send you the prescription. If she's no better in the morning, tell her to go to the hospital. Drink this. Let me help you. Okay. You've a little dog. Filippo, poor thing hasn't eaten yet. Poor thing. I'll feed him if you want. You're an angel, doctor. Get a move on though. We can't stay here all night. But the poor dog hasn't eaten in ages. Come on, please! Look, Filippo! What a nice dinner! Why are you talking to the dog? - Here. What? Don't you like it? - He's not hungry. The dog's not hungry. Come on, let's go. Vomit! - The old woman? - No, the dog. It's not well. What, the dog? Look around. Did you notice a boiler in the house? Yes, in the kitchen I think. A new model or an old one? An old one. - Open all the windows! - It's cold. Open the windows! It could be a carbon monoxide leak. What? Air the house, open everything and get the patient outside! Doctor! What is it? - What's going on? - I'll be right there. I'll open the windows first! Let's go outside and get some fresh air. You'll feel better. Come on. - What's going on? - Nothing. Breathe. Slowly does it. That's right, get her to breathe. Breathe. Okay, I'll be right back. Where are you going, Mario? Can you hear me? What are you doing? Don't leave the patient. Mario! - Where the fuck is he? - The doctor saved us. You okay? Good boy, Filippo! We're safe, Filippo. Breathe. - Are you feeling better? - Yes, I'm fine. - The patient? - She's fine too. And the dog? No! The dog's thrown up on my raincoat! Good evening. I realised straight away it was carbon monoxide. You should have seen me. I picked the lady up and took her onto the balcony and went back for Filippo. I'm your saviour, aren't I, Filippo? I'll take him. I realised straight away it was carbon monoxide. I picked the lady up and took her onto the balcony. Then I went back to get Filippo. That's the dog. And... It was... How did you realise it wasn't food poisoning? From a number of clues. Then when the dog was sick, I worked it out. - Wow! You're on the ball tonight. - Apart from my back. Okay. Bye. Bye. Do you realise what I did? Yes, I do. I reckon I'm a national hero. They might give me a medal. Yeah, a dog's name tag! You did well. I must admit, you're cut out for this job. You show a lot of empathy towards the patients. You're patient. They understand you. Some people are cut out for it. - Think so? - Yes. You could've been a doctor. How long does it take to become a doctor? Well, it's six years of university, then three years... - Let's say ten. - No, I won't bother then. I'll be old when I finish studying. And I have other projects. Like what? I'll show you. - Look. - A motorbike? A maxi scooter. Know how many deliveries I can do on this? If I earn enough, it can become a full-time job. I might even be able to leave home. - You have to pay for the scooter. - I'll save. It seems a bit... You're an intelligent person. You could aspire to something more than delivering food. I mean, aim a bit higher. Doctor! Are you growing fond of me? No. It sounded like it. Anna? I'm not... - What's up? - I'm not feeling too well. I took too many drops. How many did you take? I took those drops. How many? Drink some water and try to vomit. Start the engine. Hello? Try and stay awake. Don't drop off. Are we going then? - You know where? - Yes. Come on! Anna! Hello? Hello? Careful. How are you? Not too good. I made you throw it all up, I think. How many did you take? I don't know. Grandpa, what are you doing here? Hello! Grandpa's come to see us. Mummy, are you okay? Yes, I'm fine, sweetheart. Don't worry. You go in there. Pier, will you see to her? Me... You must be the famous Chiara! I'm Mario. Hello. Listen, I'm a little hungry. Have you anything to eat, a biscuit, a sandwich? There's some cake, it was my birthday yesterday. Your birthday? Happy birthday! I tell you what. Show me where the cake is and I'll cut you a piece. A little piece. It's my cake! Okay, a big piece then! What did you do? I took ten drops but they didn't work so I took some more and they did. Sure you weren't attempting something stupid? I only wanted to sleep. How many are you taking? - How's Chiara? - She's fallen asleep. I told her the story of Iron Man. It's absurd that she's six years old and hasn't seen it. How's Anna feeling? Better. Her pulse is normal. That's not what I meant. Carlo, my son... had an accident two years ago. A car crash. A truck driver fell asleep and crossed into his lane. He didn't stand a chance. I was in Africa when it happened. My ex-wife was in America making a new life for herself. She's not such a nice person anyway. Anna was left all on her own. She gives a few private lessons but someone had to help her. What about the drops Anna took? It was Chiara's birthday yesterday and she was asking Anna all day long, "Where's my daddy? Why's he not coming?" Forgive me, but... I need to tell you this. Don't get angry. Maybe you're the one who's the idiot. - How? - How? Anna must have had a terrible day. She called you to say she can't sleep and you send her a tranquillizer? You can't solve everything with medicines. And you didn't even come to your granddaughter's party! Chiara told me. She's convinced you don't love her. She's only a child. She doesn't understand these things. - I do this work for her too. - Fuck your work! It was your granddaughter's birthday. You should've come. To spend time and eat together. To watch Iron Man. Anything! Why don't you mind your own fucking business? Keep your nose out. I thought after all this time we've spent together, I could tell you. We're not friends. I'm a doctor and you're someone who... delivers food to people. You kind of work for me right now, but we're not friends. - Yes? - Girl. Age 25, probably otitis. No, my shift's over. Sorry. - I'm not going. - Yes, you are, it's close by. It's 15 minutes to the end of your shift. You know what it's like, we've all had a long night. I'll go. Are you sure? Yes. Send me the address. I'll leave the car outside afterwards. I'm just a delivery guy. How are you? Awful, Pier. Awful. I'm sorry. Never mind. It's obvious you don't like being with us. Not that again? - You weren't here when Chiara was born. - I was in Africa. You weren't here for her first birthday. Ebola was rife. And her second? Third? You'd made a new life there. Admit it. Another job, another home, another woman. We all knew that. I suppose when you spend all that time so far away, even your son becomes a stranger. Every year, he hoped you'd walk through that door to see your granddaughter. And every time, he said you couldn't care less about us. I'd tell him he was wrong. That the people down there needed you. I tried calling him lots of times but he never answered. - What was I to do? - Just be here. That's all. Yes, but... I'm here now. Are you really, Pierfrancesco? Chiara's lost her father. She deserves a grandfather, right? I know it hurts to see her. It had the same effect on me at first. You've no idea how much she reminds me of Carlo. When she laughs, when she cries. Life goes on, Pier. If that's good or bad, I don't know. Maybe Carlo was right. We shouldn't see each other. We'll go our own way. No. Let's try. Come in, doctor. Good evening. - On the left. - Okay. May I? Listen, I've had a headache and nausea for the last two hours. My ear hurts too. Perhaps it's otitis. - I had it three years ago too. - I'll take a look, ma'am. - You don't have to be so formal. - Right, ma'am. Coffee? - I'd love one. - Freshly made. I couldn't drink it. Wow, great! You're expecting! Not that great! It's been kicking since the second month. - He might be a footballer. - It's a girl. Women's football is very popular right now. Her name? We haven't decided yet. - But I've five weeks to go. - Right. Oh God! What... - Doctor... - What? - Have you peed yourself? - No. What do you mean? What colour is it? It's very clear. - Her waters have broken then. - Waters broken? - Waters broken? - They're broken! - Take a look. - Where? - Where do you think? - Who are you talking to? - Oh God! - Can't the father take a look? Where is the father of this nameless baby? - In Berlin on business. - Of all times! Stop chatting, Mario. Examine her. What do I do? - Get her to lie down. - Oh crikey! - Shall we lie down? - Yes. Tell her to spread her legs. Okay. Wait. Put your leg on here. - You sure it's not otitis? - Of course! I'll get my gloves. Oh hell! I'd rather have the impacted faeces. Does it hurt? - Yes. - Let me see. Right. Mario! See anything? What? Doctor! Doctor, wake up! Mario! What's up? Doctor! Wake up! Doctor, wake up! Fuck! Mario! Mario? Mario! Mario? - Mario? - Who's this? Hello? I'm the doctor's colleague. He's fainted. What the fuck do I do? You're in labour. Keep calm. Did you attend antenatal classes? - Yes. - Then breathe as they taught you. Stay on the phone, I'll call an ambulance. Hello, 118? This is Dr. Mai. I need an ambulance, it's urgent. A premature birth. Via Mari, 66. I'll put you through, hold the line. Why now? They told me five weeks! Don't worry. Just find a comfortable position and breathe. Oh God, I'm dying! You'll be fine. Well? Hello? Fuck! I'll join you. Stay on the phone. Where are we? Are you okay, doctor? Who are you? Oh God, doctor. I can feel her head, is that normal? Bloody hell! Yes, Dr. Mai. The ambulance is on its way. It'll be there in 10 to 15 minutes. Great, thanks. Hurry up, it's urgent. Thanks. - Hello. - Hello. - Who is it? - Santa Claus! Who do you think? Get a move on! You'll have to help me. I'm coming. I'm here now. Ouch, my back! Easy... No, doctor, I can't do it. You're young. Birth is the most natural thing in the world. Have you had problems with hypertension, spotting, contractions? No. Then I'm worse off than you. Right. Hold it, let me feel her. We can't wait. - What? - I'll have to deliver it. No! Shouldn't we go to hospital? No! I've called an ambulance. I'm here now. I've seen midwives deliver hundreds of babies in Africa in much worse conditions. Just relax. Mario, boil a pan of water and find some clean towels. - Like they do in films, okay? - I get it! Water and towels. - Is everything okay? - Everything's fine. - Don't worry, I'm here. - Okay. Come over here and sit on the edge. That's it. Don't worry. Relax. - What's up? - Who is this guy? Him? He's a trainee doctor. Dr. Mario. He's really good, I take him everywhere. I won't go anywhere without him now. Dr. Mario. What is it we do in these cases? - We cross our fingers. - Apart from that. What is it we do? We calm the woman in labour and help her to push without clenching. Okay, now relax. - Relax. - Breathe. - Push. - Good! Good! Good! Good, that's right! - Push hard! - Go on! Push! That's right! Push, come on! Push! One last time. - Come on! - Hard! Breathe and push. Breathe, come on! Well done! Well done! Is she okay? She's fine. You did a great job. Then afterwards, you can cut the cord. No way! I might hit a nerve! - No, you're good at it. - No. Next time. Ours is a wonderful profession. Wonderful. Wonderful. - Do you want to lean on me? - No, thanks. I'd be embarrassed if people saw me. Well done. You did well. Good job. I owe you an apology. What I said at Anna's house was wrong. Don't worry, I shouldn't interfere. It's not my business. No, you were being honest. I was wrong. That doesn't happen very often so I'll admit it. Thanks. But when it does, I own up. - Will you take the scooter home? - Yes, don't worry. Thanks. Can you take me to Anna's? Yes, any other favours? Another injection? No, I'll do without, thanks. Wake up! How are you? - What time is it? - 8:00. - Why did you come back? - Well... I had to bring your scooter back. And to tell you I'm an idiot. Stay there. No, I have to get Chiara her breakfast. Don't worry, I checked on her. She's asleep. I'll see to it. Recently I've... missed out on so much. I know. But that's enough now. I don't want to lose you too, you're the most precious things I have. I swear, I wasn't trying to do something stupid. I know. Of course not. You sometimes need medicine to forget things. Yes, but medicines cannot cure everything. For example, you're holding my hand and I can already feel my back pain is much better. Strange, isn't it? With all the medicines I take. But get some rest now. Thanks, Pier. Can I have a piece of chocolate cake? Of course! In fact, you know what? You can have the whole cake. A whole cake. My birthday was yesterday. Yes, but Grandpa missed it. Grandpa missed it. Grandpa missed it yesterday so I'll buy you the whole cake today, eh? Mummy says it was Daddy's favourite. Yes. It was your daddy's favourite. What can I get you? A whole chocolate cake for my granddaughter. - A whole one? - Yes. - For your granddaughter? - Yes. - A whole one. - Okay! - I'll have a carbonara. - At 9 in the morning? - Why not pasta with calf intestines? - No, a carbonara. It's a bit more English breakfast! Wait a sec, Pier. - What's up? - Is your blood pressure a bit high? - What? No, I'm fine. - Yes, well done! - Right? - Silly! - Spot on! - There's nothing wrong with me. - You have high blood pressure. - Me? - Yes. - I'm a doctor. - You have high blood pressure. - Cut that out! - A doctor with high blood pressure? - No way! SOME TIME LATER Scissors. Scalpel. Scissors. - Well done, perfect incision. - Thanks. I know. This is from my hometown. You eat it warm. Stop playing Operation! Mario, you're 30 and off duty now! I'll just hand out the mozzarella first. Here you are. You're my favourite nurse, you know? And you're my favourite Diabetes type 2 patient. Pier! - Hi. - My back's gone again. I changed Chiara's bed. She's grown so much, her legs were sticking out. I took a Toradol, but... Seeing I'm on duty tonight, I was thinking... Maybe... If you could... eh? I'll be there in 5 minutes. Are you leaving? I have lives to save. Subtitles: Laser S. Film s.r.I. Rome
