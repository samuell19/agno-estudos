Where are we going? - No. No. - Baby? - No, no, no. No. - Ava? Listen to me. The virus has not spread there yet. We'll go there. We'll wait it out.

Your brother, he hates me. No. I... Look, why don't you go stay with your family? I'm sure it'll be much better. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. You're welcome there. They love you. Listen, I know what I'm asking. But, it's... It's our only option. We can go, literally, like anywhere else. What do you mean?

Kelly! Kelly! Kelly! - What? - Baby? Hey. Did you make it okay? You can't force me to come here and then ditch me. I'm sorry I tricked you. I knew you wouldn't go if you didn't think I was gonna go, too. They asked me to cover the CDC in Atlanta. I had to go. Then you should have left me in LA! Okay. I'm sorry. Just sit tight. My brother's gonna pick you up. I'll call you later tonight. Look at that. Look at that. Can you start getting pictures of this stuff? Look at this guy, right here. Hey. Ava. Hey, Max. Hey.

No planes are being allowed to take off, commercial or private, through at least the end of the month. Again, the entire United States will continue to be a no-fly zone until at least the end of the month... ...has been the policy as well. Federal office buildings have been closed throughout the country and the US Postal Service has been suspended until... Mail come today? Mm-mm. Welcome. Thank God you're safe. Come. Oh, sweetheart. Oh! Oh, oh. I am so glad to see you! Let me look at you. Oh! How beautiful you are. Look at your hair! It's so long, Amanda. I mean Ava. I always slip back, don't I? - It's fine. - Come on in. Make yourself at home. She's gonna be another mouth to feed. She doesn't know how to do anything. - I'm just gonna have to... - Give her a chance. All I'm asking you is to try and get along with her. I don't want her family coming around the house. I don't want anything to do with what he's up to. She shouldn't get mixed up in it either. She isn't our responsibility. As long as I'm here, she has a place to stay. The CDC spokesperson, Lindsey Palermo argues, protecting public health is a paramount... Sorry. Oh! It's all right. Come on in. Have a cup of coffee. I get it that it wasn't your choice to be here. But I'm really happy you're here. Don't mind Max. You know how he is, set in his ways. Maybe a girl would be interested if he loosened up a little bit. Oh, trust me. There's plenty of girls. Just no settling down. Oh, I think I'm gonna take a little rest. Would you mind taking that out to the boys? They'll be starving by now. Max? What? Brought lunch. Put it on the fridge. Hi. I fed your cows. I bailed your hay. What else you need? Hi. Hi. I'm Ava. Yeah. I know. That's Jake. - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. How's the fence? Fence? I started it. Yeah, I need you to finish that today. It's raining. You're gonna get wet? - All right. - Take Ava with you. - Hm? - What? Yeah. You gotta earn your beer. You got any pants? Ow! Fuck. - You all right? - Yeah. Used to be three of us out here. You know, everybody got scared. Going home to their families. Now it's just me. - And this is a huge property. - Yeah, I know. Here. Why don't you grab one of these? Get a good one. How do you know it's a good one? You'll know. Stick it right there. This way? Yeah, like that. Hold it tight. - Are you seriously gonna hit that? - Just hold it. You slide this on top. Scoot. And then... I'm taking out all my anger issues on this fucking fence. - It's leaning a little bit. - Well... It's the thought that counts. All right. First day. You have nineteen new voice messages. Hey, Ava? Look, I'm sorry. You know I'd be going crazy if I was back there right now. I... I couldn't sit this one out. I just wanted you to be safe. Will you just call me back so that we can talk about this? Okay? I miss you. You're good at this. Yeah, I used to do it when I was a kid. Why don't you take care of her? I'll go look after the big ones. Okay. Have fun! It's for your hands. What's all that? Oh, I have the... I have the main house and barn on back-up. The solar panels and pump generators. I didn't know you were such a doomsday buff. I like to be prepared. Officials say that this a temporary precaution. Many residents are wary of being stranded long-term... What do you need? Okay. Oh. Oh, sweetie? Will you make sure we get this, please? Yeah. Thanks. You need to vacuum-seal those. Hey. Go with him. I've gotta... redo all these. I'll take care of it. - You sure? - Mm-hm. Hey! I'm coming with you. No, you're not. Go finish with the meat. Gas prices have been sky rocketing, starting at just a few dollars a gallon last week. We're now seeing a range anywhere from ten to thirty dollars a gallon. We've got Walker on the line right now. Walker, what are you hearing? Nationally, we're facing a huge crisis of fuel and panic issues. Gas stations can't keep up with the demand, while deliveries are stalled, causing many residents to stockpile fuel. Whoa. This is everything? That's all we got. - Come on. No... - Sorry. ...the fuel shortage is taking a toll on public transportation as well. Many bus lines have stopped running, causing businesses to close temporarily due to absent employees. - What? - Stay in the car. - Are you kidding? - Just stay in the car. Hey. You're good. All right. You know what to do. What do you think? We're gonna... We're gonna need some defense or something. Shh. Shh. Yeah, I mean, the interstate travel ban is affecting the delivery of infrastructure, particularly... Hey. - ...of the remote and more rural... - Hey. How're you feeling? Great. ...there's a lot of chaos going on as they work to figure out exactly how this virus is spreading... Yeah, you should be Sheriff, Buck. You sure you can spare it? I'd rather you have it than them. Speaking of, Bob wants a word. Reporting earlier, officials in LA have set up a triage center at Dodger Stadium to attempt to handle the heavy influx of patients. Doctors have cordoned off specific sections... Oh, hey. - Great, Bob. - What do you want? What can I get for you, Amanda? Um, shot and a beer? My granddaughter sure loved that TV show of yours. They're all into that, uh, vampire stuff. Now what is it? Zombies? Werewolves. Yeah. That's it. How about you, Jake? You want another pop? - Quarantines are expanding from twenty-three - No, ma'am. - US cities to nearly sixty. - All rightie. The number of reported cases domestically has reached ninety-thousand. Compared to seven hundred-thousand... Oh my God, I'm stuck here forever. This is happening. - I didn't know we've gotten to that point. - Yeah. Well take a look at the news, man. And they're only getting worse. What are they talking about? Oh, they're talking about forming a militia. And Max doesn't think it's a good idea. You can be with us, or you cannot be with us. So I'm acting like I'm going to war? Call it what you want. But this is how it is. I'll be back. All of this is adding to the sense of fear and chaos as people fight to get home to their families... It's all right. It's all right. Amanda, we've been worried about you. When'd you get back? Why didn't you call?! She doesn't wanna talk with you. None of your business, Rhodes. Come on. Step away from the truck. Let's go home. Step out of the way, son. Can't do that. This is family business. I said step aside. Hey! Hey! Not in my place! Now, you know I have zero tolerance for this crap. Get back inside. Hey. Dinner will be ready in an hour. You take a day off? I had a meeting. Where? Hm? They're doing something, Max. What do you think we're doing? All right. If you keep hanging out with those guys, don't bother coming back. Where's the rest of your insulin? I only have the one bottle. I'll be fine, sweetheart. Okay. Ava, hey, uh... Give me a call whenever you can. Please? You should call him back. Why? He's just worried. He's trying to do the best that he can. In his way. Then maybe he should be here. I just checked again. We have no insulin in stock. Sorry... This isn't working. How long is the bottle gonna last? Not long enough. Where are you going? I'm going out. - Right now? - Yeah. Lock up. Where are you going first? You don't have a plan. And we have Kelly Rhodes on the line outside Atlanta. Kelly, any updates from the CDC? Uh, thanks. Well, the CDC has declined to comment and they haven't updated their statement from last week. But, I've gotta say tensions are high inside Atlanta. As you know, strict travel bans have been in place for several weeks now. Frankly, people are scared. They wanna get their families out. They want information. I think until we get some sort of positive news, we're gonna continue to see civil unrest escalate. Hey, this is Kelly Rhodes. You know what to do. Hey. Um... I know I've been avoiding all your calls, but... ...you should know your mom, she's really getting sick. I don't know how much she's told you, but the insulin will be out really soon. If you could do anything. Make some calls. We could really use your help. Look, I know you think what you're doing is important. We really need you here, too. So just, come home. Okay. - Any day now. - Shut up. Focus on those bottles! This is a shotgun. All right. Yeah, you don't hold it like that. You wanna hold it... ...in the pock in your shoulder. Okay, keep your elbow out. - See how it creates that pocket in there? - Mm-hm. Okay. You're gonna take your cheek and put it against the stock. Aim right down the center of this barrel. Okay. All right. Now, you barely have to aim. You just have to point in the direction that you want to fire and you're gonna hit something. Pump it. Now it's loaded into the chamber. - It's gonna be loud. - Okay. Yeah. Eject it. Now there's a new one in there. Do the rest of them. Okay. This is awesome. - That lipstick. - No. Why do you even have that many lipsticks? All right, so now you need to replace my bullets. And you need to replace my beer. - You need to replace... - Shut up. - ...your pride. - It wasn't that bad. You need to replace... Hi, Amanda. Max? Will you come inside, please? Here, I'll... I always loved you in, um, short hair. But this is nice, too. What do you want, Maddy? I heard you were back in town. I wanted to say hello. Okay. Thanks. Can we talk a bit? I... I wanna hear all about your life. Really? That's it? That's all you want? I'm tired. - I just need a little money. - I knew it! Just a little bit to get on my feet. You know how your father is. I never asked you for anything. I don't owe you anything. That's no way to talk to your mother. - You're not my mother. - I am your damn mother. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it! Well I guess you never gave a shit what happened to me, so I guess nothing's changed. Hey. Hey! It's what you want? Here. Hey. Don't come back here. Are you asleep out here? No. Just thinking. She's not gonna come back to the house. Why did you wanna be a farmer? I didn't. I wanted to race cars. Um, what? Yeah. When? Oh, before Dad got sick. But things got bad senior year and someone had to take care of the farm. College wasn't my thing anyway. Yeah, well at least you graduated high school. I pretend to be a werewolf. Every day. It's a really bad show. Nah. Don't be so hard on yourself. Yeah. You just kind of left. Real young. It didn't feel like a choice. Yeah. I just had to go. Change everything. My name, even. Kelly doesn't even know all of it. Not everything. Did you come here often? Yeah. I came here all the time when I was a kid. By yourself? - Yeah. - Yeah? I wouldn't take anybody here. So who's house is this? Um, it was the, uh... hired hand of my great-grandpa's. No way. What? Um, his wife left him and he went bankrupt. They took what they wanted and didn't come back. In here. It's a trap door. To what? It's just a hole in the ground. I used to hide stuff in here when I was a kid. Mostly booze and cigarettes. You got any left? - No. - Ugh. Drank it all. - I know. - Sorry. Three. Ugh! Okay. All right. Two out of three. Two out of three. Two out of three. - Okay? One. Two. Three. - One. Two. Three. Oh my God! Stupid game. [phone ringing] Cause you're losing. That's why it's stupid. Hello? Yes. Yes, this is she. He's my son! No! No! What do you mean you can't locate him? - They can't find Kelly. - Let me talk to them. - Stop. - Mom! - Stop. No. - Let me talk to them, okay? Yeah. This is Max Rhodes. Kelly's brother. When... When was the last time that you saw him? Uh-huh. Yeah. What? Hey. ...in Manhattan, the phone lines are down and we can't reach any additional... ...declare the United States, under martial law. The disaster relief aid is on its way to unaffected areas of our nation. And the WHO remains relentless in the... Ava! Mom? Mom, listen. Mom? - Hm? - Stay up. Grab some corn syrup. It's all right. Wait. Her blood sugar is crashing. She's just not eating enough. - Come on. - That's right. - A little corn syrup. - Take a little more. There you go. There you go. It's gonna be all right. Hey. Are you okay? Hey, how you doing? Don't. Shh. Come on, Mom. No. No! I said no! We can't just do nothing! It's too... I can't just sit around here. You know? I have to at least try. - Do not get into that truck! - Mom. No. Do not get in that truck. - No! No! - We have to. You are not going! You are not going! - Mom! - You are not gonna die for me. Shh, shh! - It's okay. It's okay. - Please? Please don't let him go. Cause I can't be alone. It looks pretty quiet. What is that? I don't know. See what happened, Bob? Just got here. Max! Amanda! Get in the truck! You see this, Rhodes? This is what I'm talking about! It's what I've been talking about the whole time! I hear your mom's not doing too good. Max! Are you heading into town? Amanda, be smart. - Max! - Keep your head down! Stop! Stop! Max! Max! Hey! Let's go. We're going. Get in the car. Amanda, please? Don't make that trip tonight. Come on, son. Max. Don't, don't.

If you get in the truck with me, I'll leave it out here for them. Look, we don't have power like you do, so the sooner you get it into your fridge the better. - No. - Max. Amanda? You belong with your family. No you don't. Max, we have to. Your mom. It'll be at the house when you change your mind. We're gonna be okay. Hey. Hey. We'll find another way. She's gonna be okay. Max?

It's gonna be dark soon. Jake? Hey. You ready? Yeah. It looks like it hurts. It's fine. - It's fine? - Yeah. - Yeah? - It's totally fine. You don't have to pretend with me. I know you're tough. Hey, did you think about what I asked? - Yeah. - Yeah? And? I don't think we'd get very far. Why not? I think we'd make a great team. Back. Don't you think so? - Yeah. - Yeah. We could take care of each other, you know? Don't you want that? Yeah. What are you doing? I think we should go. We should go before they get back. We should go tomorrow. - Ava? - Come on. Let's go.
