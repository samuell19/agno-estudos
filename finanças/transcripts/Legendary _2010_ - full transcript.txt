Oklahoma. They call it the Sooner State. So named for those early pioneers... ...who jumped the gun in the land rush of the 1880s. Sooners, as in "too soon." As in maybe they didn't exactly follow the rules. I say this certainly not to pass judgment, for my granddaddy was a Sooner... ...but to suggest, my friends, the spirit that is Oklahoma... ...and thereby the heart of its people: An ambitious bunch of independent, strong-willed survivors... ...who tend to live by the principle of feast or famine. You see, in Oklahoma, not all legends are about victory. Some are less obvious. Some you don't see coming. Some are born out of struggle. If I don't get that pump fixed, y'all are gonna reside in the bathtub... ...which will not be popular with the owner of that bathtub. I know y'all pee in there. All right. Come on. Hey, look. It's Chetley. Hey, Chetley. What are you doing, bathing? You feeling lucky? I don't know, Barrow. - Is your mother here? - What the hell does that mean? Do it with your mom? That's so gross. Shut up. My mother? Pansy. He's not worth it. Later, sucker. Hey, there. Hey. Name's Red. Yours? I'm Cal. I couldn't help but notice that you had a little trouble here. Oh, that. Well, you know, it's... It happens. I'm kind of an easy target. Maybe, but you stood up to him. - Yeah. - Any special place I can drop a line? Well, the fish bite better on that side. Good, good. All right, then. Well, I'm off. See if I can come face- to-face with one of those nice, fat catfish. See you again. All right, see you later. "Peace, my fearless friend... ...who touched so many with his courage and heart. You took it far. We'll take it from here. Harry Newman." - Hi, darling. - Hi, darling. - What are you doing? - Just waiting for you. - What's that? - What? Did somebody hit you? Tell me who, Calvin. What are you gonna do, pop a cap in his butt? - I could. - Then we'd have to move. Where would you like to move to? North coast of Ireland, maybe. Come here. I bet this never happened to Mike, huh? I was thinking we might get chicken tonight. We could. Could a third person come along? Who? His name is Larry Edwards. How come I never heard of this Larry Edwards? Well, he's on his way over. You can say hi. What does this Larry Edwards do? He's the assistant district attorney. Good, that means this guy will be paying for dinner, right? You would think. Wanna come? No. No, then he won't pay. When you dine with the actual district attorney, let me know. - There's a few things I'd like to discuss. - That's my boy. - Hey, Ma, you heard from Mike lately? - No, why? Just wondering. What's he been doing? I don't know. He's on an oil rig somewhere. Gather up the rest of the guys and meet at the tool shed in 10 minutes. Chetley. Chetley. Listen, I'm real sorry, Mike... ...but I gotta let you go when we hit T.D. on this one. Basin's slow, looks like we're gonna have to idle one of the rigs. I'll keep your name on file, give you a call when we get back up to speed. - How long? - I couldn't tell you. Right. - Hello? - Hello, Mrs. Chetley. Hello, Studley Do Right. How's your day? It sucks. I have a meeting for the school newspaper and a late lab. Don't say "sucks." I'll be home when you get there. - How was dinner last night? - It sucked. - Thank you for asking. - You're welcome. - I'll see you later. - Bye. I'm not sure she bought it. Well, since you've never actually approximated the inside of a gym... ...I would wager she did. All right, back to starting positions. Inside pummel, inside pummel. Everybody ready on my whistle. Let's go, 10 seconds. Inside pummel. Work it. There you go. Go, Barrow. Good, good, good. Hip-over. Do two hip-overs. You guys ready? This one's 10 seconds. Keep it going, keep it going. Figure eight, figure eight. Ready, ready, here we go. Nice. Locking hands on feet, locking hands on feet. Everybody ready? Work it, work it, work it. Hip-overs, full roll. Last three guys, last three. Full-roll hip-over. Working it, working it. Good hustle here and we're done, okay? Nicely done, fellas. Get to the locker room. Get your studies done tonight, be good boys, see you in the morning. I told you, don't bunch up. - Whoa, yeah, dude. - This is exactly like I expected it to be. Hey, get away from that girl! I knew that was you. What'd you do that for? Everyone knows you grew melons over the summer. - You don't have to show them. - I got reasons. - Anyways, they like it. - Well, what's there not to like? No, don't do that to me. I've known you too long for that. - Is the catfish pond pump working? - Not good enough. - I'm gonna lose customers. - How much you got? Not enough. Hey, Luli, if I tell you something, you promise you won't laugh? No. I wanna join the wrestling team. - What do you think? - Do you know how? No, but my dad was a college champion and my brother was an All-American. So I figure it's in the genes. Doesn't look like it to me. - I bet he could show me a lot of things. - Who, your brother? - You don't even know where he is. - Yeah, I do. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well... ...would you wear those little tight-fitting wrestling suits? Yeah, I guess so. I'd watch you. Cal. Cal. - Cal. - Hey. - Where did you get that scale? - Donald had an extra one. Well, I'm not getting on. Ma, you got nothing to worry about. You do know what to say. - How much do you weigh? - One thirty-seven. - Is that good or bad? - It's good, I guess. - I gotta go. - Yeah, me too. Good, good, keep working it. Keep it going, 30 seconds. Work it, work it. - Hey. - Hey. What the hell? You here to watch, or you wanna get on the mat? I'd like to get on the mat, sir. Coach Tennent. Cal. Chetley. - Chetley? - Yes, sir. - What's your weight, Cal? - One thirty-five pound class, I guess. One thirty-five. All right, we're a little thin there. Put that down, take those off, follow me on the mat. All right, ups and downs, ups and downs. Hey, Timmy, work in with coach for me. - Yes, sir. - Barrow, I want you to work in with... Cal, was it?... Cal, here. Half speed, work on the basics. Cal, down position. This is about wrestling now, right? Yeah, sure thing, Chetley. Hey, hey. Barrow. What part of "half speed" didn't you understand? - Sorry, coach. - Come on, help me out here. Chetley, down again. Come on, guys, come on. On my whistle. - Get off me! - Hey, hey, hey! - Come on, come on. - Hey, hey, hey. Relax. You have some kind of history between you? Yeah, coach. I think Chetley, here, is interested in my mother. Chetley, are you interested in Barrow's mother? No, sir. At least not with all her clothes on. No gravy, Ma. Mom, no, thank you. - Joined the wrestling team today. - I knew it. I knew it, damn it. - Damn it. - What? The scale, and dieting. - You're wrestling. - I just said that. - When did this start? - I just told you, today. Why are you wrestling, Calvin? Why? - Because it looks like it's fun. - No, it doesn't. - Mike wrestled. - Is that why you wanna wrestle? No, I was just saying Mike wrestled. Darling, you and Mike are two entirely different people. What's that supposed to mean? It was in his blood or whatever you guys call it. Mike needed to wrestle. It was his thing. You have a lot of other things going on. Name three things. Geology, science club, debating, music, catfish pond, news... - How many more do you want? - If I wrestle, I can't do all that? - No. - Why, will it make me stupid? Apparently, because that was a stupid question. Cal, I know wrestling. It's demanding. It will take you away from other things. Everything else just... Why now? - Because Mike wrestled. - I know. You already said that. - And Dad wrestled. - And it ate them up. Mike also got hurt and he was built like a car. - You're a beanpole. - Thanks for reminding me. Should we pretend you're something else? They have a 135-pound weight class, or have you forgotten that? Why are you so interested in Mike now anyway? I don't know. I guess he and Dad probably spent a lot of time together. What are you thinking? He's gonna help you? Help you know your father? He won't. He will just disappoint you. You have no idea who Mike is. - He's my brother. - Right. One you've seen, maybe, what? Once or twice in 10 years? Whose fault is that? Pump, you are a never-ending source of mystery to me. Who are you talking to? No one. - Stupid thing. - What's wrong? I'm just trying to get this pump fixed. It's driving me crazy. - I wanna wrestle, Luli. - I thought you were. - What happened? - I told my mom about it. - And? - And she just about gave birth. - You wearing that outfit to school today? - Do you like it? It's... - It's different. - Good. I was aiming for different. So you like it then? Sure. I'd love to see you wrestle. Who you looking for? - Mike Chetley. - Yeah? I'm Calvin, his brother. Is he here? Mike? Cal. Calvin. - How'd you get here? - Bus. Then I walked. Can I use your bathroom? It was a long ride. What brought you here? I was kind of thinking that maybe you could... ...you know, show me how to wrestle? Just... Just sometime. I mean, I was thinking I'd try out at 135 pounds... ...but I don't know much. - I don't think I'd be much good to you. - I think I could be good... ...with the right kind of training. Just the basics. I've been studying a bit. About leverage mostly, seems like. You know, just getting the right angle and... I don't know what I'm talking about. Why do you wanna wrestle all of a sudden? - I don't know. - Cal, I'm just real busy right now. Coach can teach you the basics. That's why he's there. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Maybe we could... We could just visit once in a while. There's ain't very much in my life that you're gonna wanna be a part of. - I just thought because we're brothers... - Not right now. Hey, Jim. - Hey. How are you? - Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute? Okay. Cal's not interested in wrestling. I don't know, he seems eager to learn. He's looking for Mike. I've already lost one kid to this sport. I don't wanna go through it again. Sharon, I doubt the sport had anything to do with it one way or the other. Anyway, it's not really up to me whether Cal wrestles or not. There are things about Mike you don't know, Cal doesn't know. It turns out he wasn't as unbreakable as everybody made him out to be. Nobody is. You know, if I say no to Cal, you're just asking for a different kind of trouble. Tell you what. How about I watch him? Make sure he's out there for the right reasons. And if another Mike shows up at tomorrow's practice... ...willing to sacrifice everything in his life for this... ...you're gonna tell him to ease off? - Yes, I will. - At the cost of victories? Trust me. I don't really even know you, but you better be telling the truth. That kid is all I got. - Sharon? - Yeah? How is Mike? I don't know. - Hey, there. - Hey. - How's it going? - Catch anything? Yeah. A nice shoe bass. Put up a hell of a struggle. They always do. Wanna share some of those heavy thoughts you're carrying? I don't know. Yeah, I guess so. You ever wanted something... ...you know, or someone, or wanted to get someplace... ...but just didn't know how? Yeah. Wanted to be a Western movie star... ...and ride off into the sunset with the girl, like John Wayne. - Why didn't you? - Couldn't ride a horse. Well, yeah. All right, I'll tell you. - I wanna wrestle. - Wrestle? - What's the holdup? - I don't think I can compete. Well, you ever wrestled before? - No, never. - Well, that's your problem. It's foreign to you. It's fear of the unknown, kid. So who's this someone you're looking for? Someone? Yeah. You said something or someone. Oh, it's... It's my brother. So this brother has something to do with your wanting to wrestle? Yeah, maybe. Why would you ask that? Old man intuition. Listen. Follow your instincts. You'll be fine. Yeah. You know, if you use crappie instead of worms, you might have better luck. Thank you. Advice taken. What's the matter with you? - Hold on. - Injury time-out. I'm Timmy's backup. I'm the same weight class. I'm next in line four nights from now. Ridgecrest wins by injury default. Hundred thirty-five pounds right on. - It's fate, Cal. I can't wait. - Let's hear it for Timmy Hughes. Hello? - Hi, is Mike home? - No. - Is this Jill? - No. Well, do you know when Mike's gonna be home? No. All right, well, could you leave him a message for me? Yeah. Could you tell him that his brother Cal is gonna be wrestling Friday night? Okay, thanks. Hello? Nice girl. Okay, guys, let's settle down. Listen up. Listen up, everybody. Please, can I have your attention? We're gonna be starting with... ...135 weight class. Visitors' 135-pound, step up on the scale, please. Mark Hayes, come up. Get on the scale. One thirty-five even. - Attaboy, Mark. - Home team 135, step up, please. Riverdale, that's Cal Chetley. Cal Chetley. C-H-E-T-L-E-Y, coach. Also 135 even. Okay, 140. Drawing the first match of the night is the 135-pound class. First name calls Mark Hayes. And for Riverdale, in his very first match ever, Cal Chetley. Riverdale in red, St. Paul's, the green. Attaboy, Mark. Winner by fall, first period, Mark Hayes of St. Paul's. Come on, don't sweat it. They get easier after this, all right? You did fine. You never quit. - Go have that looked at. - Okay. Good job. What? I gotta go. I'll call you. Forgot to tell you, your brother called. He said he was wrestling or something this week. I saw Luli at the match last night. I say she's all the girl you can handle. Luli's not my girl. - Does she know that? - Ma, come on. - It's Luli. - And how is Luli? She's going through an interesting phase right now. She needs a woman in her life. Yeah. Her mom never comes to see her anymore. She has four brothers. Yeah. What fun for her. Tell her to come see me sometime. Are you all right? You mean am I gonna keep wrestling? Yeah, I guess that's what I mean. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I can't really quit. I'm the only 135-pounder on the team. And that kid was about the best 135-pounder in the state... ...so I figure it can't get much worse. There it is, there it is. Hey, Mike. Watch yourself, boss. Problem? - What? - I said, do we have a problem? Hey, Donald. Do you think I'm the worst 135-pounder in the region? You haven't wrestled in enough matches to be considered the worst in the region... ...according to the State Athletic Commission. Do I think there's anyone in the region you can defeat before the year's over? It's mathematically possible. Oh, well, thanks for not saying no. Hey, dingleberries. I heard your brother used to be the man. Didn't help you too much, did it? So? So now he's a punk. Losers. - Muskogee County. - I didn't know Barrow could read. "Mike Chetley, 28 year old, was arrested and charged with major assault. Repeat offender, $5000 bail." Hello, young fella. - Hello. - Hey. - I haven't seen you in a bit. - Yeah. How'd that wrestling thing turn out? Yeah, I'm quitting. Wasn't right for it. According to whom? Well, I haven't won a single match. Well, not surprising seeing as how a month ago... ...you didn't know a wrestling mat from a bath mat. How's that brother of yours? He's not really interested. Well, I know a little something about brothers. Had eight of them. If you need your brother... ...I can promise you that he needs you. Now, he may not know it like you know it, but he does. Don't give up on that wrestling thing. Yeah. I have a good feeling about you. Hey. - What are you doing? - I need to borrow your scooter. I'll bring it back tonight. - Are you in trouble? - No. I need you to give this to Coach Tennent. Yeah. Wow, this is exciting. I feel like we're eloping. Yeah, except you ain't coming. At least kiss me goodbye. All right. Thank you. I owe you one. I'll be collecting too. And it won't be on the cheek. All right. Your Honor, my client's altercation with Mr. Brock... ...was a reaction to both physical and verbal taunts. I believe Mr. Chetley felt that he was fighting for his life. In addition, he has made arrangements to enter into alcohol rehab... ...and personal therapy to address his issues with anger management. I would ask, at this time, that the court allow my client to pursue this... ...under the state's supervision. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Chetley. Anything you care to add, sir? Your Honor, I don't go looking for trouble. I got put in a situation, and, well, I reacted the only way I know how. You seem to have a history of that, Mr. Chetley. Your Honor, ma'am? Hi. May I say something on his behalf? Tell the court your name, please. Calvin Chetley, Mike Chetley's brother. Step forward, please. My dad died when I was young and my mom works a lot... ...but Mike sort of took the place of my dad after he passed on. And he teaches me a lot of things. A lot of things that my mom can't. Your brother is in a lot of trouble. You do realize that, don't you? Yes. Yes, ma'am, I do. But I think that sometimes guys come after Mike... ...because they see him as some kind of a target. And he and I have this deal, right, where I'll go out with him... ...and I'll always step in if any kind of trouble starts so he can just walk away. I just... I wasn't there this time. Your Honor, I'm gonna give you my word that you won't see either one of us... ...in your courtroom ever again. I need Mike. We kind of carry each other. That's all I got. - You hungry? - Yes. I'm really hungry. Yeah. What do you want? I don't know. It's just been a lot of years. I meant what do you wanna eat? Okay. Sorry. I don't know. I'm kind of having trouble with my weight. You know, keeping it down. Thanks. Actually, I'm starving. You know, Mike, I don't want anything from you. I just wanna know you. Cal, I've been alive 28 years. I just couldn't tell you much about the last 8 or so. - What happened? - I don't know. One day dad was there and we had a plan, and then... Well, then he wasn't. Luli. Hey. I was hoping to catch you. - Hey, Mrs. Chetley. - Your old scooter finally quit? Well, it ain't been running too good, that's for sure. You wouldn't happen to know where Cal is, would you? - Wrestling practice, I imagine. - No. No, I went by the gym on my way home. Yeah. He got up awful early this morning. Too early. - He does like to study. - Yes, he does... ...and you're not a very good liar, darling. Well, ma'am, I only had two ways to go. Lie to you, or break a promise to my best friend. Fair enough. I'm just worried about him. One thing I know about Cal is he'll be all right, if that helps. Okay. I appreciate that. Come by sometime. We'II, you know, do girl things. I'd like that, ma'am. So I won the geology essay competition... ...and used the winnings to build a catfish farm. It makes me a little bit of money when I can actually keep it running. Mostly I just like to go out there and think. Does Mom know you're here? No. No, she doesn't know I'm here. I should probably go. How is she? Oh, she's... She's okay. Think she wishes she had girls. She misses you. Can I stayed away... ...because... You want me to teach you how to wrestle? No. No, Mike, you got a lot going on. It's not that important. Yes, I would love it if you'd teach me to wrestle. - I'll do the best I can. - Me too. Where have you been? Nowhere. Just hanging out with friends. What is this place? Church. You ready? - Hey. - Okay. Three parts to becoming a complete wrestler. Offense, defense and psychology. We'll talk psychology later. Today... ...we're gonna work on speed, leverage, knowledge and strength. Okay. We're gonna have to build yours. Oh, he's back. Drinks all around. - Did you take a little vacation, Chetley? - You wish. - Funny, didn't seem to notice you missing. - Why'd you bring it up then? Cal, I need you right now. The rest of you, circle up, get started on your own. Hey, circle up, let's go. Cal, we had to forfeit a match because of you. Now, I give each one of my wrestlers one shot to save their ass... ...before I toss them from the team. This is your shot. I had to help my brother with something. Screw up again and you're done. Do we understand each other? - Yes, sir. - All right, now get out there. Thank you, sir. Lumbrowski, I see you. It's called a watch. Get one. Cal, get up. Back straight. You go in with your back straight. That's where you get your strength. When you circle... ...look at my left leg. Don't take your eyes off it. Look at it. And when you're ready to make your move... ...halfway through, switch to the right. Tie me up with the right. Your right leg on mine, keep me from panning out, take me down. - You understand? - Yeah. Here. So the next time, you actually shoot for the leg you're looking at. Or maybe you don't. Maybe you don't look at all. You just keep coming and juking. Knowledge. - You learn quick. - Well, you teach quick. Hey, I read you once pinned a guy with a reverse cradle in a close match. Yeah, reverse cradle. It's not a move you wanna shoot for, especially against a wrestler who's good. It's an easy way to get pinned if you don't know what you're doing. - How does it work? - Easy, bud. Let's learn to walk before we can run, okay? Yeah. Hey, did you get a job yet? - No. - I got you one. Through my geology class. I know some guys at Sooner Pipe Works. They can get you off the rigs, put you in a truck... ...servicing the online wells. Money ain't bad. It's pretty steady. I ain't out of line about that, am I? No. No, I just... I ain't used to getting that kind of help. What was it like working with Dad? I tell you, man, it wasn't work. It just seemed like Dad always knew what to do with me. Yeah. - You finish your homework? - Yep. - Wanna do mine? - Nope. Nice heinie. Thank you. Speaking of heinies, my mom wants you to stop by. - Your mom wants to see my heinie? - She didn't say. All right, tell me about your opponent for tomorrow. He's five and five. I've never seen him before, but he lost to a kid who beat me 11 to 2. All right. You know, Mom's probably gonna be there tomorrow. Good. You gonna talk to her? Cal, I never said anything about going to meets. - You understand. - No, I don't understand. There's gonna be a lot of folks in that gym. They're gonna wanna talk to me about what I've been doing lately... ...instead of those trophies I won 10 years ago. That's including Mom. Tomorrow's about you. I'm not gonna get in the way of your match. - Well, when are you gonna talk to Mom? - That's not why we're here. No, I... I know. Psychology. One twenty-nine and a half. Step down, please. First time you see your opponent is the weigh-in. One thirty-five, Claremore. Step on, please. Look right through him. He doesn't exist. It's a confidence game. Somehow, you are gonna instill fear. One thirty-four and a half. Step down, please. - Riverdale. - Chetley. You're thinking one thing. That your girlfriend is in the front seat of his car. And if you lose, she's going home with him. And you think that over and over again. You let it burn, because it'll show in your eyes. Chetley. Step on, please. You do it right, sometimes they pee themselves. Yeah. There's one more thing. You gotta weigh in naked. Naked? It's... Trust me, it's uncomfortable, but it makes them more uncomfortable. Because it shows you're proud and it shows you got nothing to fear. One thirty-five even. Step down, please. One forty. After that, you find a spot in that gym. That's your spot. Your space. You can go there. Bring music with you. Music you love. Music that gets into your soul. You do all those things and that's gonna give you the edge. - Okay. - All right. Do it, Cal. Don't let him up. Final score 7-5, in favor of Cal Chetley. Team score Riverdale 12, Claremore 9. That was Cal Chetley's first win ever in a Riverdale uniform. Let's hear it for our 135-pounder. Keep going. No. Hold him. - Damn it. - You got speed? Let's see it. - Oh yeah, I got speed. - Show-off! Thanks. Hey. We're gonna pick it up a bit for regionals. - More time? - No. A better use of the time. How? Well, you got that week off for spring break. Eleven days till they start. That's enough time to get serious. - Serious? - Yeah. Serious enough to show me the reverse cradle? No. You know, a good friend wouldn't eat those in front of me. Don't watch. So we going to the dance together? - Might be working. - What? Yes, I'm taking you to the dance. - What are you wearing? - I haven't really thought about it yet. - And dare I ask what you're wearing? - It's a surprise. - Well, is it legal? - I'm making it. Well, that's encouraging. Luli, you're not still showing the boobs, are you? You're looking good on that mat, Calvin. You actually look like you know what you're doing. Yep. - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Depends on what you wanna talk about. I just want you to know I'm proud of you for getting out there. - But? - But nothing. I wish it were golf, but it's not, so... Just know I'm gonna be there for you. - Okay. - No matter what, I'm gonna be there. You gotta know that. Just don't let it push you too far, please. Mom, I'm having fun. One day when we're older and sitting in rocking chairs... ...I want you to describe to me, in a way I can understand... ...how wrestling is fun. Okay. Hey. Practice ends about 4:30 every day, right? So, what exactly do you do for the next few hours? I just, you know, jog. Work on the weights, go to lab. Okay. Well, it must be working. You look good. - Hi. - Hey. Shit howdy. Who are you? His name's Theo Henderson. He's a bigtime tiny wrestler. We call him the Gnat. - He's the smallest guy I could find. - Well, it's nice to meet you. - What's up, man? - How much do you weigh? - About 145. - Each leg? - Come on, come on, spin. Get it. - Good job. Switch. Come on, Cal. Let's go. Let's go. Beat him. This is kind of like that Extreme Makeover show. Minus the boob job. No one's ever done anything like this for me before. You're gonna be the belle of the ball, Miss Luli. - What are you wearing? - Something I made myself. - You do that? - Oh, yeah. I make sure I accentuate some areas more than others. How about some girl-to-girl advice? Well, that would be a first. Scooch over. Don't sell the whole package at one time. Give them small hints. Keep them guessing as long as you can. And then keep them guessing a little more. Let them know you have other options. Be confident. Don't chase, be chased. I wish. Well, this helps. - Miss Chetley? - Yes? How old were you when you first kissed a guy? - Thirty-two. - What the hell? - I was 16. - I guess. - Was it Cal's dad? - No, but it got his attention. He was second. - Were you chasing? - No. Sort of directing. That's what I'm talking about. - Good kid. - Yeah. He seems to know where he's going, man. Where you been, Mike? Look, I don't hear from you for I don't know how long, and then out of the blue? - I don't know. - You broke one of your golden rules. You stopped moving. You're up now. You look good. Stay up. Keep moving. There's your reason. I don't know, man. Sometimes it ain't that simple. Cal. Come on. Come on. Get down. All right. The reason the reverse cradle is such a risk... ...is you gotta trick your opponent into thinking you're done, okay? - Okay. - All right? Now, listen. If I know you're stalling, I'm going for a pin. You're gonna ball up. So when you ball up, I gotta press you to flatten you out, right? I'll press you and my head will come over your shoulder. You see it come over the second time... ...you got a moment. You gotta grab a headlock. Grab it, right there. Okay, good. You're gonna roll to your shoulders, hook a leg and squeeze. Roll, hook and squeeze. Go. Lock it. Good. Reverse cradle. No escape. - Don't mess with me. - What? - You don't mess with me. - Oh, my God. Shit howdy. You wanna go? Check it out, man. Now the party's started. Yeah. For sure. That was nice, Cal. - You hungry? - Yeah. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We are gonna pick it up a little for you guys. Hey, Stringfellow. Will 5 bucks get me a little private showing? Come on, babe. I'm like the only kid here who hasn't been down Boob Boulevard. Sounds like a personal problem. - Barrow, walk away. - Come on, Luli. I'm a big spender. - Hey. - You pervert. - Hey. - What the hell are you thinking? Get off me. What, Chetley? What are you gonna do? You all right? Come on. Let's go. - You okay? Come on. - Back up. Get off me, man. Why does stuff like this always happen to me? Because you're Luli. You bring it on yourself. - I hate myself. - No, you don't. Just stop trying so hard. You're like a butterfly in a wind storm. Meaning what? Meaning... I don't know what it means. It means you're just special, I guess. No, it doesn't. - They just don't like me. - They don't know you. But you go about it the wrong way. If they knew you, if they really knew you... ...they'd like you. I do. Hey. You really look nice tonight. Thank you. Hey. Come here. - Hey, Mike. It's been a while. - Hey. So, what are you drinking? - Whatever's on tap is fine. - You got it. Excuse me. Here you go. I don't want to do this, man. I don't think you got a whole lot of choice in the matter. Hello? What? What? Where? I... I can't understand you. Cal? Was that Mike? - Why is he calling you? - What did he say? I don't know. He's drunk. - No, he's not drunk. - He's in jail. - That's bullshit, Mom. He's not drunk. - How would you know? Cal, how would you know? Because I see him every day. That's how I know. We've been working on the mat for the last month. Mom, he hasn't had one drink, so something happened. - A month? And that's where you've been? - Just a month. - How do you think I've won anything? - Coach Tennant. - He's working with two dozen wrestlers. - How and where did you find Mike? In his house. It's not that hard if you're really looking. That's not what I'm asking you. This is me you're talking to. You've never kept anything from me before. You've spent more time with Mike in the past month than I have in 10 years. And you don't even know him, and you don't think I should know? - I didn't want it to go wrong. - What? - Mike. - Why? Because he's my brother. I have the right to know my own brother. What do the two of you talk about? Wrestling. That's it? Work and school. I guess it's not like we talk about the wives or kids or our favorite colors. I don't even know him that well, do I? That's not fair, Cal. I was afraid of you and Mike together. - Why? - Mike is unpredictable. I became afraid of him. I didn't know how to help him. But you're the best friend I've ever had. What exactly happened in the car? Your dad and Mike... ...were headed to Eufaula to scout one of Mike's opponents. That's what they did. These guys were prepared, Cal. But there was... There was heavy snow, ice. Mike was thrown from the car. Mac wasn't. I begged them not to go. Dad knew Mike could take this other kid, but... But... And he didn't think they needed to go, but Mike pushed it. I remember him throwing your dad's words back in his face. "Take no opponent for granted." So Mac did what he always did. He kept his word. - Did Mike quit wrestling after that? - No. No. No, he got hurt a year later... ...but he really gave up the night your dad died. He blamed himself for Mac's death. I think maybe... What? I was... Cal, I was so lost. I was so devastated, and I didn't know it at the time... ...but I blamed him too, and Mike felt it. I was 18 when Mike was born. Your dad and I were just kids. He was my first, and your first is always your baby. You were an adult when you came out. I had to ask for your ID. Then I lost both of them. Ma, you said that Mike blamed himself... ...for Dad's being killed. Did anybody ever tell him it wasn't his fault? I think everybody in here has a shot at the medal round this weekend. The next couple of days, we're gonna show them what we're made of. So let's get it in our heads right now. Okay? I'll see you guys in the morning. Bus leaves at 7:30 sharp. Be here. Let's get our hands in here. Tornadoes on three. One, two, three. Tornadoes. Hey. Good luck. Good to see you. Something told me I should be here. Why now? Cal. He believes in you... ...and he was right. A friend in the DA's office... ...a guy I dated for about 20 minutes... ...ran down the waitress where you were arrested. She'll testify you didn't take a drink and you didn't start the fight. I talked with your parole officer. Cal needs you, Mike. It scares you, doesn't it? Yes. This scares me... ...but Cal really wants you to be there for him. And I want you to be there. For Cal. You know, Mike... ...I've tracked you over three states... ...and not a day goes by... ...that I don't think maybe this is the day you'll show up. And I'm listening to Cal tell me that you two wrestle, that you talk. And I'm thinking, " I want that." I want... I want my son back, but I still don't know how. Let's get you out of here. Come on. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, kid! - You did fine. - Hey, Cal. Calvin? With that win, Riverdale's Cal Chetley moves into the 135-pound semi-finals. What the hell? You don't belong here. - Maybe I do. - No, you don't. For all the goodness your dad brought to your life... ...I don't believe he ever taught you how to accept loss. It was always about showing up prepared. I need you to show up. Maybe I'm not right for Cal. It's like you said, just don't think I know how to lose. You do now. This may sound simple... ...but that boy waiting for you... ...hasn't experienced the pain we've been through. I can't breathe sometimes. Because in my heart... ...I know I blamed you at a time... ...when I should have been protecting you. And I never made it right. I am so sorry. I'm your mother... ...but I was choking on my grief and my anger. But, baby, we have to somehow put Mac to rest. Yeah. I think that's what Cal is trying to do. He's... He's trying to help us. Dad, he made me feel invincible. I just... I couldn't pull him from the car. Cal. Cal is trying to pull you out. Let him. Was I right? Seems that you were. Is he out now? Yeah. Beyond that... ...I'm not sure. Hopefully he's working some things out. How did you do? I'm still in it. Good for you. Now, go wrestle. When you show up, things happen. I know that's what Dad would say. - You coming? - I'll be there. All right. Welcome to Tulsa in day two of the Oklahoma District Three championship. All coaches report to the director's table by 10. Jesuits Lugats, report to the scores table at Mat 2. Know anything about Leonard? Well, from what I hear, he puts his pants on one leg at a time. All wrestlers begin clearing the mats at this time. One-hundred and 35 pound semi-final match. Hayes vs. Rayber. Red. What are you doing here? Rumor has it you won some matches yesterday. Yeah. Where you going? Oh, I'm done. I didn't want this. I was looking for something else. You sure about that? Took a lot of courage to come this far. You made something happen. Now I hear you're two matches away from a district title. I'd say that's time pretty well spent. How come you always seem to know what to say? Sometimes these things take time to work out. But no one's asking you to win, Cal. Just don't quit. Hey. I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee, head inside there and get a seat. Looking forward to your match. Winner Mark Hayes, by decision. Second semi-finals, 135-pound class. John Leonard, North Shore... ...vs. Cal Chetley of Riverdale. Leonard vs. Chetley, center mat. - Hey, where you been? - Just wandering. - Come on, you ready? - Yeah. All right, listen. Two minutes at a time. Listen for me. Get out there. Chetley in the red anklet, Leonard in the green. Give them cauliflower ear! Come on, Cal. You can do it. Come on, shoot. You're okay. You're all right. You're all right. You're all right. Go, go, go! After one period, Leonard leads Chetley 5 to 2. You're all right. You're good. You're good. You're good. Come on! All right. Get him! There you go. Yeah. Yeah. Come on, get in. Come on. Go! Go! - Go. Crack him. Crack him. - Damn it, come on. Come on. Yep. Come on, Cal! Take him down. Hey. You're all right, man. Winner Chetley, Riverdale High School by injury default. That's my Cal! Oh, God. - Who taught you the guillotine? - I've been doing a little homework. That was textbook wrestling. You showed a lot of character, no two ways about it. I'll come back and get you. - Good to see you, Mike. - You too, coach. - Been a long time. - Smell of the mat never leaves you. You're welcome to take the coach's seat next to me when he's up if you want. - I'd like that. - Good. I recognize the Chetley spirit. In about an hour I'll come back and get the both of you. Okay. - Everything all right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I had a little help. - Mom? Okay, remember, Cal. You're not me. You're not Dad. You gotta wrestle your own way. Use your opponent's momentum against him. Use them long legs, damn it. It's your best weapon. - You got your music. - Right here. You got 10 minutes. What do you got? - Opera. - What? It's like Italian opera. Who are you? Never mind, we're doing it your way. - Crank it up, you take it in. - All right. Opera. This is a good day. You know our boy listens to opera? I want you to know you're everything Cal described, only better looking. - I'm Luli. - Hi, Luli. Could you give this to Cal before this last match? It's real important. I sure will. What is this, a Volkswagen? Hey, Shaquille O'Neal. That was horrible. What's this? This is a heavy present from somebody named Luli. "Here's your edge. I love you. Lu." - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - A pump. - Now, that's romantic. - It is if you know Luli. What the hell's this? That's Luli too. Hey, give us one more, kid. We're all out there. I will. Cal. You're already a medalist. Let's go out as number one. Okay. What the hell? Damn, coach. I hope the fire marshal doesn't shut us down. You know that guy? That's Dad's coach. - Red's Dad's coach? - Red. That's Harry. - Harry? - Harry Newman. "Peace, my fearless friend. He touched so many with his courage and heart. You took it far, we'll take it from here. Harry Newman." That guy's Harry Newman? You know him? Yeah. Through fishing, mostly. - And now, our 135-pound finalist... - Dad's here. ...representing St. Paul's with a dual-meet record of 23 and 0, Mark Hayes. And representing Riverdale High School... ...with a dual meet record of 5 and 6, Calvin Chetley. Chetley in the red, Hayes in the green. And please welcome back to the tournament past All-American... ...NCAA finalist... ...and three-time state champion, Mike Chetley. Here we go. Get around him. Gotta get around him. Come on, now. Get him, Cal. Let's go. He's setting it up. Come on. Come on! - He's out! He's out! - Come on. Cinch it, Cal. Cinch it. - Get him! - Come on! Oh, baby, buckle up. Squeeze it, Cal. Squeeze it. Cal, squeeze it! Squeeze it! Come on, come on! Come on! Get him. - Get him, Cal, get him! - Come on, cinch it, Cal, cinch it. Come on. - Get him, Cal! - Come on! Cal, come on! Pin him! Mark Hayes, winner by decision. Final score: Hayes 11, Chetley 9. Like I said, not all legends are about victory. Some are about struggle... ...finding out who you are and your reason for being. Big Mac Chetley died before he had a chance to finish the job. That was his greatest fear: that Sharon and the boys would struggle on without him. - You got heart, kid. - Thanks. - You thought I was done, didn't you? - Yeah, I did. He once asked me if anything were to happen to him... ...that I might help keep an eye on the boys. Mac, your boys are fine. So is your girl.
