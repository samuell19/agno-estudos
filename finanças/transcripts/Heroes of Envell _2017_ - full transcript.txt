Okay, guys! I'm coming. These kids… Today they leave their laptop at school. Tomorrow it's their head at home. Heroes of Envell New Game Turner, what do you have there under the notebook? - Nothing. - That's not true, Mrs Johnson! Art is playing a game! And Kira, Vic and Phill are playing with him! Here, I caught them on video! Arthur, Kira, Victor and Phillip, stand up! Put your phones on my desk. And hurry up! But Mrs Johnson! We'll miss the raid! Tons of loot! Rare event! Please, it's very urgent! Andersson, what is this pirate lingo? We are in school, not at sea. Could we have the phone for just one minute? Turner, humility is not your virtue. That much I understand. You'll all get your phones back after classes. Mark, your phone too. That's not fair! Why me? For the same reason: using your phone during the lesson. What's the plan? Go in, find the phones, start the game and collect the bonuses till the promo ends. Phill, how much time do we have left? Three minutes. Let's go! Move, move, move! They are not here. - They should be! - What about Jane's phone? - Two minutes. - We won't make it. We can access the game with my password through any browser. - From someone else's laptop? - Who'd find out? What was that? Who cares! It's not working. Let's leave before we get into trouble. I can smell the trouble already. You okay, Art? I'm fine. Where's Mrs Johnson? The question is, where are we? What do you mean? Hold on! - Where are we? - No idea. I fell asleep, and I woke up, and there was a castle, mountains, and whatever this place is. Oh, I see. You're playing a prank on me, aren't you? Sure, Art. We built all of this especially for you. Hello! Don't you get it? Somebody kidnapped us and threw us in here. With no phones. And the promo's over. Watch your step! Who could've built all this? I don't know. But they went cheap on roads. There are huge letters in the sky. What letters, Vic? Huge ones. Is this a dead-end? Welcome! My name is Buckwit! I'm your guide in the world of Envell. - Game?! - Yes, yes. This is all a computer game with the most real-life experience in the world. Full immersion, literally. To start your adventure, please select your characters. Can we exit? SELECT YOUR CHARACTER NOW! Unfortunately, first you need to select a character and complete your first mission. I take the sorcerer! - I'm the thief! - Knight! And I guess I'll take the... weird one. Well, let's start! Not bad! Your first mission is to defeat the practice monster. That's it? Sorry, I didn't mean to. New players? Wonderful. They can be a nice addition to my collection. We should call the iron... what's his name! - Buckwit! - I'm here. Buckwit, what do we do? Ah, but I don't answer questions during battle. During battle? Get rid of him already! What is all this? Not fair! I hit him! Phill, smash him with something! Right, right! Just a sec! Oh, I think I need to power-level the spell. Kira, catch! Piece of cake! How about some real enemies? Cancel! Cancel! Take them back! Art, what's the plan? It's okay. They are only bots. Can't we handle bots? Let's play! Congratulations! - Do you want to save the game and exit? - Yes! A-ha! Oh, the bell! I’m telling you, it was VR. Someone snuck in on us and put glasses on our heads. Come on, it wasn't virtual reality! It was all for real. It's nothing else but... who knows what else... Kira, what do you think? Either all of us went crazy, or that was magic. Phill, you got a text. I'll read it later. Wait! But our phones are at school. That's magic! Salamandra! Yes, my Lord! Some players just completed the training mission. Go stop them!
