Partido Alto... like I've said, it's the most authentic expression in samba Sure is. That's why I sing it. To my love I leave my feelings In the Lord's peace To my children I leave a good example In the Lord's peace My legacy is the strength of will In the Lord's peace He who sows love will always be missed In the Lord's peace To my friends I leave my pandeiro In the Lord's peace I honored by parents and loved my brothers In the Lord's peace But I left the Pharisees no money Not I! In the Lord's peace To false friends I leave my pardon In the Lord's peace Because... A sambista needn't belong to an academy It's natural when poetry and the people make him immortal Because... A sambista needn't belong to an academy It's natural when poetry and the people make him immortal But if there's sadness then let it be sweet In the Lord's peace For no poet enjoys ugly sadness In the Lord's peace And a surdo marking time to the cuíca solo In the Lord's peace The guitar asks, there's no reply In the Lord's peace If you pray for me, then do so dancing samba In the Lord's peace For a good samba is a form of prayer In the Lord's peace And a good "partideiro" only weeps in verse In the Lord's peace Drinking love with a dash of lime In the Lord's peace And as I lead my life singing In the Lord's peace I leave my song to the people In the Lord's peace And as I lead my life singing In the Lord's peace I leave my song to the people Say it! In the Lord's peace And as I lead my life singing In the Lord's peace I leave my song to the people In the Lord's peace And as I lead my life singing Partido Alto samba... some forms contain similarities with Partido... such as music from the Northeast, for instance "repentista" music, because Partido form also has an improvised form. The improvising emerges not only in the theme, the refrain but also in the mood which gradually emerges. Mangueira has a Partido which goes like this: Who raised the doubt, who was it? Who raised the doubt, Who raised the doubt, Tell me! Who raised the doubt, who was it? Who raised the doubt? Who raised the doubt, again! Who raised the doubt, who was it? Who raised the doubt? My friend, comrade, Tantinho, get away Who raised the doubt Who raised the doubt who was it? Who raised the doubt? Oh who raised the doubt? Who raised the doubt who was it? Who raised the doubt? A sugar cane breaks another in the plantation, who raised the doubt? Who raised the doubt who was it? Who raised the doubt? Who raised the doubt Who raised the doubt, who was it? Who raised the doubt? And now a verse from Osmar, who raised the doubt? Who raised the doubt, who was it? Who raised the doubt? Who raised the doubt, who was it? Who raised the doubt? When I pick up my cavaco I no longer want to speak Who raised the doubt? Who raised the doubt, who was it? Who raised the doubt? Who raised the doubt, who was it? Who raised the doubt? There are many forms of Partido Alto, but the number of verses varies. Quartets, pairs, for instance. And after it found its form Partido spread to such an extent that now it's considered the first part of a samba. So much so that the great samba masters said that in the old days samba had no second part. It was a type of Partido, but a samba with one part, where the verses were improvised. And in Partido form I remember at Portela we used to have a type of Partido very different from today's. In fact I think no one does it anymore. A Partido you'd recognize from the sound of the cavaquinho, from a percussion instrument... Where a "roda de samba" is formed with no refrain. Just the cavaquinho playing in the background. Plus the other rhythms which would start forming according to the spirit of the work you wanted to develop. We had various steps in Partido Alto. The little "miudinho" went rather like this. Go on! That's it! So there was that. Nice, Wil! That's it. Various forms of Partido. We also had a way of dancing Partido... with your hands on the hips, Sheila will do it, show us what Partido used to be like. The chick would enter the circle, gliding and swaying with her hands on her hips. Nice, Sheila! We also had another type of Partido a step called "Amoladinho". Tantinho will do it now. Very nice, brother! - I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry! - I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry! - I'm going to cry, my dear - Don't cry! - But I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry! - I'm going... - Away. - I'm going, say it! - Away. - At the break... - Of day - At the break... - Of day - But I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going... - Away. - I'm going... - Away. - At the break... - Of day - Oh good... - Lord! - Oh good... - Lord! - But I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going... - Away - I'm going... - Away - At the break... - Of day - Oh good... - Lord! It's here... - The break of day - But it's here... - The break of day - I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going... - Away - I'm going... - Away - At the break... - Of day - At the break... - Of day - If you're not in... - You're out - If you're not in... - You're out - If you're not in... - You're out - But I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - But I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going... - Away - I'm going... - Away - At the break... - Of day - Oh good... - Lord! - I take... - My guitar - I take... - My bag - I take my... - Lord - I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going to cry, my dear. - Don't cry. - I'm going... - Away - I'm going... - Away - I'm going... - Away - I'm going... - Away - I'm going... - Away - I'm going... - Away AT MANACÉA'S HOUSE I think that Partido Alto is a little music of communication, immediate communication. It's something which says so little and tells so much. When I started Partido Alto... it's a variation of samba, right? A samba with slower steps. I just love the rhythm of Partido Alto. The traditional Partido Alto where the "sambistas" improvised... and you know there are a lot of "sambistas" around who don't improvise but I have a knack for improvisation, right? What comes into your mind when you think of Partido Alto? Partido Alto was the early samba which came to Rio from Bahia... and which was called Batucada. So the big names back then... Tony Brancura, Bahiano and others... Ibrihin and others, Paulo da Portela. Paulo do Partido, he was really Paulo da Portela, right? When I was a kid in Quintino, which is where he lived... he was born in Engenho de Dentro, hes used to pass by the house... sing with my father, they'd have such a ball, not like rich folks. Ask old Candeia. Yeah, I want something like this, I know, little miss's raucous... because Rodolfo's angu went bad, no one should could have... gone that day, everyone arguing, fighting... Rodolfo's angu went bad and everyone starving... it ended in a racket, little miss's raucous. But don't sing that! When he used to show up, holes in his shoes... now he has soles and everything, so now he's Judas's client... no longer a bum. He's the boss. Oh, what'll become of me... Yes, like that, I mean, I want the old time samba... Samba with just the first part, and for the second... they'd would make up the verses. I want to find some real Partido Alto, see? A little Partido Alto refrain to give them a basis to work from. There. Yes, something a bit like that. Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Scattered on the ground Love starts with Partido, Partido from the heart The name of this Partido is lime tree lime, oh lime Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground Life at, the beach, I chanced by Conceição's house There I drank, I drank the true lime, the lime Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground Manacéa's pagode is the best like soap And the accompaniment is lime cocktails Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground I just got here and I'll go to the lime tree To get a lime in desperation, oh lime Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground Oh lime tree, lime Oh lime tree, lime So many ripe oranges and limes Fallen on the ground Samba's Aldair, for better or worse I'm son of Alvarenga, grandson of Napoleon, oh lime The lime tree, the lime Although abandoned, I've accepted my pain Let me live alone... I get along fine without your affection, love No, I don't want your caresses, I'd rather live in the forest Living like a bird I'm leaving, no one lives here now And Andinho joined the samba, and the samba is good, although Although abandoned, I've accepted... The Partido group is a moment of liberty. A good "Partideiro" musician will improvise the verses, like João da Gente used to, Alcides, Aniceto do Império, Candeia and so many others. Today there's no obligation, anyone can say their verses... even if they've been learned. ...didn't your mother say, it's the time of the old guard And I'm Castinha, I don't want to bring up the rear Although, although abandoned I've accepted my pain Let me live alone, I get along fine without your affection, love Castinha, great friend, he spoke the truth, the Portela old guard, Pure sincerity. I'll tell you what it is I have to say... I admire Castinha, may God give him a fine place. Although, Although abandoned When I was a boy, I saw in Partido a form of communion between samba folks. There was joking, taunting everyone joined in as best they could and for fun. The purest art is each of our own personal style. And only Partido Alto offers this opportunity. I went to the samba, at Carolé's place, the fingers and toes, are on her hands and her feet. But the samba's so sweet and it'll continue that way Although Although abandoned I've accepted my pain Let me live alone, I get along fine without your affection, love I belong to the Old Guard tall and thin our Partido is Paulinho da Viola. Joãozinho, I can't deny fidelity Partideiro of Portela, that the descent never ends Although although abandoned I've accepted my pain. Let me live alone, I get along fine without your affection, love. Listen, officer, don't lock me up they're beating everyone up... We suffer for things we didn't do. Today, samba has so many restrictions... which curb the "sambistas"' creativity... within the limits dictated by showmanship. But in Partido, there'll always be "partideiros"... and the verses, whether improvised or not will reflect the truths felt in each person's soul. So come on, man, get with it!
