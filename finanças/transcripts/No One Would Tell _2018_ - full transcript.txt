And I have to admit that I was uh... thrilled. Living vicariously through her. And when did you start to see red flags? I didn't. Sarah, remind me to re-think the whole skirt thing. A bit cold? Yeah, and I just low-key flashed your neighbour. Oh, your hair is fierce. Maybe I'll just chop it all off. Girls? Skirt shipment is missing and Christophe is freaking out so I have to go into work. Extra cream for you, and black for you, my love. Alright, girls. What is on your agenda for today? Let's see... crashing a party? No? Um, matching tattoos. Um, actually there's a- there's a big wrestling match after school. We might go. Supposedly there will be free pot. Wow. Alright. So um, you're gonna be home... A little before dinner? Perfect.

I prefer bachelor number two. Really? Mmm. Who is that, even? Rob Tennison. He transferred in last month. Apparently just to be wrestling captain. West Sound poached him? West Sound has good taste. Get him! Get him! Come on, man! Keep it tight on him! Let's go! Okay, shake hands. Get some manners, nerf herder! Shake hands please. Damn, what got into you? I couldn't say. But I like it. Miss C., are you cooking? Is it safe to eat? Hey, I cook when motivated. Does motivation have a name? Timothy. Occupation? Architect. Mmm. And I'm betting he likes Italian food. Where'd you meet him? I bought him a drink a couple of days ago. He comes into the store all the time because he's friends with Christophe. I don't know, I've had my eye on him for a little bit. You bought him a drink? Um... Rob Tennison just added me? Who's Rob Tennison? Uh, uh- McDreamy junior. Sarah defended his honour at the wrestling match today. Holy shit. Hey, Sarah Joy Collins. It was called for. He's outside. Outside where? Outside outside. He's outside. Hi, I'm Rob. Hi. I'm Miss Collins. Miss Collins, nice to meet you. Why don't you come on in? Thank you. I was just wondering if Sarah wanted to come for coffee or cocoa. There's a new shop that just opened up a few blocks away. Uh, I said I'd study with Nikki. Oh hey, don't bring me into this. I gotta bounce. I wouldn't say no to a hot chocolate. We have pre-calc homework. Oh hey, I do too. I'll have you back in plenty of time to finish. There's whipped cream on top. Yeah, yeah. At ease, soldier. Arm thoroughly twisted. Let me get that for you. Oh. Alright, after you. Thank you. If Rob really was such a bad guy, how could you have missed it? Ok, just look at him. He's smart. And he's charming. He's right out of a Jane Austen novel. And he picked Sarah. Oh my god! Where did that even come from? Ok, but West Sound is so tiny. It is tiny, so why haven't we bumped into each other? Um... we don't really run in the same circles. What is this, an Austen novel? Gasp. He reads? Occasionally. Just enough to impress the smart girls. I'm not that smart. Mmm. Who said I was talking about you? Oh, that's gonna leave a mark. Alright, come on. You are that smart. You're a nerd. Nerd is a strong word. I'm sorry, would you prefer nerf herder? Hey, I happen to like nerf herders. I've always been a Star Wars fan. And uh, I may be partial to nerds, as well. Especially the humble ones who have no idea how pretty they are. Oh... how did you know where I live? I may have bribed the student office assistant to pull up your address. Right. What'd you bribe her with? A date with Gus. Uh, that reminds me, I should tell him he has plans on Saturday. Actually, it wasn't that hard. People pay attention to you. Even if you don't realize it. Well, it's-it's either very impressive or very creepy. I'm flattered. Oh. Here, come here. Oh, alright. Perfect. Hey, let's get out of this rain. It went that well, huh? It was nice. He um... he invited me and Nikki to his friend Zach's birthday on Friday. That's alright? Two dates in one week? Rob is on the offensive. I'm impressed. It's not a date. It's a party. I don't wanna... make things weird. Right, right. You all play it cool as you do. That was loaded. No, baby, it's just that this is the first time I've seen you even remotely interested in anyone in that way. And Rob just doesn't- I don't know, seem like somebody you need to overthink. How do you still do it? What, date? Yeah. Well, some people are happy being alone and others want a partner. I'm the second one. Even after dad? Especially after your father. And Rob is nothing like your dad. You Googled him? Obviously. Oh. I like seeing you get out of your comfort zone. Mmm. Makes mama very happy. Happy. Muah. Welcome, I'm Alexa. Bathroom's down there, no go zone's over to the right, and all the food's right over here. It's Sarah, right? That's right. And this is Nikki. Hey. Boo! If you're drinking use discretion, know what I'm saying? No puking and no drunks. Alright. Well, that's the type of shit that gets you kicked off the wrestling team. And out of this house. Damn. Rob's a hard-ass. He's classy. Oh, no, no. Your classy? Come on, Zack, I want to dance. Ok. I think we need a code word for "get me the hells out of here". I'm thinking "juice box". I don't wanna play it cool. That is not one word. Yeah, I like him. Like... like really like him. I don't wanna play it cool. Ok, then don't. I can't compete with that. Jacqueline is so beautiful. Sarah. The right guy is gonna like you for you. If Rob is the right guy then there's no competition. Ok. Ok? So just go be you. Uh... Ok? Go! Uh, sort of. Um... It looks really- Hey! Thank you for coming. I'm so glad you're here. Oh, well thanks for having me. Thank you. You look nice. Let me introduce you. Yes. Hey guys. Uh, this is Sarah. Sarah, this is Zach, Alexa... Happy birthday. She just met him. You gotta control your man. It's his birthday. He can do whatever he wants. I got an excuse. Sometimes I just like to come out here and clear my head. You know, when things get a little much. Ok. I didn't mean to get all zen on you. Do you trust me? Mmm, jury's still out. Awe, come on. You trust me. Close your eyes. What, did you think I was gonna drop you? No, actually. Good. Sorry, I guess this isn't the most traditional first date. I didn't even know it was a date.

Uh, that sounds like an excuse to walk with me. Yeah, come on. Ok, but my thesis is that Stephenson's characters don't act like real people. Right, and I disagree with you, by the way. Oh, I couldn't tell. Ok, well how about we discuss it further at the lake house this weekend? Celebrate our massive milestone? One month is a milestone? If I get to steal you away, it is. Come on, it'll be fun. The whole gang's going, no adults. Can I bring Nik? If she's a necessity. Someone more interesting than me? It's just Darren from math club. I missed last week. He's wondering why. Hmm. That's why. So that was aggressive. Hey, I don't like being interrupted. And besides, this essay is due Monday, I'm gonna have no time to work on it on the weekend because I am going to be doing other things. You wouldn't happen to have another motivation for taking me to your romantic lake house, would you? There's a small chance. Mmmhmm. It's tiny. Miniscule. Right. In that case we better focus. Did you do the pre-calc homework? Yeah. Are you stuck? Yeah. I can't get past the first question. I don't know why. I don't know how to do any of... this. Crap. Sorry, I-he's... he's freaked about his essay. I'll-I'll help you in a sec. Hang on. Ok. You think because English is easy for you that it should be easy for everyone. Not true. This is important to me. Good grades are important to me. Yeah. And if you're gonna be a distraction then this? This is a hazard. And it has no point. Yeah, I'm-I'm not getting pissed at my best friend because she asked for help. And were you not the one who started talking about the weekend?

Like I'd let you. Muah. Thanks. Hey, are you guys sure that Rob's dad is ok with the whole picking you up thing? Oh, what are those? Uh, Timothy is taking me rock climbing. You realize that means you have to climb rock. Yes, but it was either that or not see him for a week. He couldn't change his rock climbing schedule? Ok, let's focus on you two, shall we? I know that I am the super cool mom but I need some assurances about this weekend away. Ok, Rob's lawyer dad's gonna be there plus all the guys on the wrestling team. Like, they literally can't do anything stupid or they get kicked off the roster. But you can drive us if it would make you feel better. Just means you'd have to cancel on Timothy. Ok, um... make sure you text me when you get there, and I get at least one phone call. Muah. Love you. Love you. Have fun. Don't break anything. Except hearts! His dad's gonna be there?

But he's been writing me poems. Leave it to you to find the only guy who can take down a 200 pound dude and writes poems. Yeah, I'm gonna need proof. No passcode? Guess we haven't gotten to the sugar fix yet. Or have we? Give it back, Jay. You do not touch another lady's phone. Only if she reads Rob's poem. Otherwise I might find something better. Fine. Two lines. Boy, you so crazy! "You are mine. "Mine alone. "The perfect gem I'll forever adore." Oops. Not cool. I didn't do anything. Robbie. Stop! Those were private! Girls like to share their boyfriend's romantic gestures. It's a compliment. They were laughing at me. You were laughing at me. No, Robbie. I just wish that you would treat me with a little more respect! Oh my god, baby- Why did you do that? I'm so sorry, I-it wasn't on purpose. Here, come here. Show me where it hit you. Oh my god. Where did-where did it hit you? Let me see. Oh.. I... it wasn't on purpose. You made me angry and- and I was using my hands and it just flew out of my fingers. Look, I'll get you a new phone. A better one. I was reading what you wrote because it was sweet. And romantic and who knew you'd have a freak out? You're right. Obviously I overreacted and I'm sorry. It's just-I've been trying to tell you something. Something that I haven't told any other girl before. It scares me. It scares you? Yeah. I love you, Sarah. Oh. Oh? Is that all you have to say? Oh? I love your hands. And your skin, and your laugh, and how smart you are. I love everything about you. When I think about you not feeling the same way... say you feel the same way. I- I feel the same way. You love me? Yes. I love you. There you are. Hey. What's the matter? Nothing. Why? You look like you've been crying. Oh, yeah. We were just out by the lake. I got a little wind burned. Oh. Hey, you uh, ready to go? Mmmhmm. Go... Yeah, it's so beautiful out there, we're gonna go in the boat. Oh, well that sounds awesome. Let me grab a jacket. Hey. Alright, Tennison, let's do this. Oh, Nik, um... it-it's kinda like a couple thing. Oh! You don't mind, do you? We'll go another time- Yeah, of course. I get it. Ok. See ya. Wear a life jacket! Hey, Nikki. Um, listen, I've been meaning to say, you're a good sport, being the third wheel. A lot of girls can handle that. We are going in the lake! Alright! Safety first. Wow. This is happening. We can just sleep in the same bed if you want. We don't have to have sex. It would be a waste of these good candles but we don't have to. Yeah, these pyjamas kinda say "cuddling only". Oh, hell no. They say "effortlessly sexy". Subtly sensual. Casually erotic. Plus, they're not staying on for long, anyway. That was the subtext. Wait... did you mean you actually love me or were you... I don't say things unless I mean them. I can tell you again now. But I'd rather show you. I'm not going anywhere, Sarah. But if you want me to stop, tell me now. You don't have to stop. ♪ Going to do what I want and that's what's up, ♪ ♪ Ain't lookin' for a man to hold me up, ♪ Bye. ♪ Black coat, pink balaclava, ♪ Pick.

First ring, that's what I like to see. What're you up to? I really need to study for my bio test. Sorry. Ah, hey, don't apologize. I like smart girls, remember? Call me if you need a break. Definitely. Hey, Nik- Sarah... Calm down. What's wrong? I hate staying in that freaking house. I've literally packed my bags like four times. Maybe you should talk to someone. Nik, she needs help. AA or- She's not hurting anybody but herself. If people knew it would get worse for me. I'm already a known weirdo. Could it be any more pink? I'll be able to find it in my bag. You could find it in a black hole. Here. Right now? She's so beautiful. Stop, wait. Oh, look at her! Give me like five seconds. Ok, fine. Look at you. Oh, what an angel. Oh, you're the worst. Oh, I'm posting that one. Please don't. Oh my gosh, that's so embarrassing. Oh, no. You like this filter? It's actually cute. Wait, Sarah. What the hell? Oh, uh... yeah, I fell. On the rocks. When I was chasing after Robbie. So you had been crying. Sorry, I-I didn't want him to be embarrassed. He felt really bad that I fell, so. I shouldn't have been so nosy. I shouldn't have- I shouldn't have read the stupid text in the first place. They were private. I would have been pissed if he read the guys some of my texts. Oh, really? Why? Sarah Collins, what have you been texting? Just... stuff for him to think about. Well, careful. It starts with a phone and then it leads to- I know where it leads. What? Sarah, you didn't. Really? That's why you weren't in the bed when I woke up. I thought you had just gone to the bathroom. Oh my gosh. Uh... was he nice? Were you safe? Nikki. Hey, even smart girls do stupid things under pressure- He didn't pressure me. Ah. If I knew I was gonna get interrogated I woulda just kept my mouth shut. Did you talk about it with your mom? Hard pass. She doesn't need to know everything I do. He said he loved me. And he thinks we have a future. He-he said it like that. "A future". Wow. No, no, no, no, no. Rob, no. Are you ok? What's going on? Um, I'm fine, I just need a minute. I need to call Rob. Okay. Babe, no... it- it wasn't planned. Nikki was upset. Upset about what? I can't say. You're a shitty liar. You picked her over me, just say it! Um, do you mind just giving me some privacy? I- I'm just gonna be two seconds. Just go in the bathroom. Is that ok? Ok. Yeah. It's fine. Her mom's a drunk. She just-she just needed a place to get away for a while. Why didn't you tell me? I- I promised I wouldn't tell people. I'm not people, I'm your boyfriend. You say you love me but how am I supposed to feel when you lie like that? I- I'm sorry, it's not what I meant. Relationships are about communication, Sarah. If you really cared about us, about me, you would have said something. I would never do that to you. Hey. You've spent a lot of time at the Tennison's lake house, right? Do you know the- the neighbour? The girl next door? She and Rob ever date? Um, yeah. They dated last summer. She's at Overlake Academy. She threw a huge tantrum when uh, Rob decided to come here instead. What's up? Can you trust me for a little bit and I'll tell you later? Promise. Yeah, sure. Thanks. It feels like it's happening fast. Maybe too fast. It's intense. Yeah, well... it's your first boyfriend. Everything is intense. Everything- But like... he texts me all the time. He wants to know where I am, who I'm with. It's... It just sounds like he's jealous. I need him to trust me, though. Not... control me. Right? Absolutely. So talk to him. You know, tell him how you feel. People aren't perfect. He's gonna have some flaws. He says he loves me. No. No? No. No, he does not. Oh my god, seriously? Yeah. Wow. See? I mean, honey, he's obviously just as freaked out as you are. Mom... do you ever worry that you're making the wrong choice? Like... like you feel like someone's the right person and then they're not? Absolutely. And then I remember that that very same type of person is the reason why I have you. Life's complicated. Thanks mom. You ok, kiddo? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Mmmhmm. Rob would call and Sarah would... snatch up the phone. You know, like she just couldn't wait to talk to him. Now I know that um, if she didn't answer right away he would get angry. She worried that he was too controlling. But I just thought that it was sweet because I thought that it meant that he didn't wanna lose her. Hi. Whatcha got there? Uh, it's a dress for Sarah. Hmm. Rob, we don't keep secrets. Sarah and I, we talk. About us? Among other things. Look, she's never had a relationship before and I'm guessing that you have. Not like this. She's... different. She'll make mistakes. Miss Collins, there is nothing Sarah could do to change the way I feel about her. I don't wanna lose her. I like her. Alright, come in. You can call me Laura, by the way, if it's not too weird. Thanks. Ok, I'm gonna be checking in periodically so be a gentleman. Cross my heart. Mmmhmm. Rob... no. This is way too expensive. Awe, I want you to have the best. I love it. But where will I wear it? Oh, hilarious. Will you forgive me for jumping to conclusions? Maybe put on the dress? Ok. Turn around. I've seen it all before. Remember? Hope you kept the receipt. Don't worry, you'll lose the weight. Besides, I'll help you. Like you said, we have a whole month. You think I'm fat? Did I say that? No. I chose you. I want you. My-my mom was serious, she could come in at any time. Well I guess we'll have to be quick and quiet. I won't tell if you don't. Yes! I actually really like this. You look so cute. Let me see the back? See? I told you it would fit. Yeah, I'm shocked I fit into this. You were so worried. Oh. One sec. Ow. Sorry. Is that ok? Yeah. Thank you. You look so pretty. Thanks. You look so cute. Thank you. Um... Do you feel good? Yeah. You should be, you look so hot. I'm gonna take a selfie. Nice! Hi. So I was thinking um... What you're wearing is unacceptable. Cover up. Now. I... I thought it was cute. Are you re-branding? Trying to get some attention by flashing leg and ass? You look like a cheap slut. Delete it. You know, nobody else wants you, Sarah. It's just me. Sometimes I'm not sure why. Sarah, are you ok? He's being an asshole- Don't call him that! She came to school with bruises. It... it was embarrassing. I showed her how to hide them with make-up. And you knew the bruises were from Rob? I did, but he was a nice guy. To me. And to his friends. In other words he never hit you so it wasn't your business. ♪ You're deep in my abyss, ♪ Oh, god. I am so sorry. I- I thought Rob was home alone. May I help you? Um, I'm Sarah Collins.

He's been down there an hour, anyways. Robert? Look who I found. I told him to clean up the mess. Oh... Alright? Now this lovely young lady can see your true colours. Well, this is my space, mom.

He's a good person, Nik. And I promise he's going to do better now. No, he's not! He loves me, and it's not all his fault, you know? I've... I've been pushing him to do things before he's ready.

So you and Mr. Cahill, all of you three were wrestlers trained in the same way that Mr. Tennison was. You didn't even believe Rob was capable of hurting anyone until your girlfriend convinced you. Cara Levitt? Yes? Hi. Um, my name's Nikki. I was wondering if I could talk to you about Rob Tennison? The Tennison's lake house? Remember, I saw you, you saw me? You were scared. I wanna know why. I dated Rob last summer and he got a little riled up one day. I was over it. Now I avoid him. Explain to me why any of this matters to you? My best friend's dating him. He gets a little more than riled up with her. The first time he was so apologetic I actually believed that it was unintentional. I decided I just have to avoid making him that angry. But the second time he hit me with a pool cue. Did you report him? Did you tell your parents- No. I didn't wanna be that girl. Not a particularly attractive label. I just left. Ghosted him. I can't get Sarah to walk. She thinks she's in love. Probably because she is. I thought about making her choose, him or me, but... she'll choose him. The best thing you can do for your friend is not make her choose. Be there for her whether she stays with him or she doesn't. Ok. Thanks. Wow. You look perfect. Laura... I got these for you. Thank you. Sarah told me you were going through a break up. The guy is an idiot for the record. But... this is a wonderful family and I'm honoured to be a part of it. Thank you. I love you. Love you. Have a good time. No, don't-don't mess up my lipstick. Come here. Muah. Apres vous. You-you look really nice. Thanks. Hey, hey, hey, hey. No. Oh, she's here. Rob. Rob, I'm not joking right now. Oh, ok. Alright. Alright. We will take a photo, but only because you look so cute. Here's a crown for you. Ooh. Awe, I love you. I love you, too. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Ha Farrow, no more talking. Let's dance! Let's go, come on! Okay. You ok? She's trippin'. I don't know what I'm supposed to do, man. She makes it so hard. Oh my god! It's so good to see you! I don't know. I don't understand. I haven't seen you forever! I know I miss you guys. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait! What's his problem? Let go of me, Rob! You were flirting right in front of me, we were in there 10 minutes! I wasn't flirting! I was talking! Hey! Get off!!! Get in the car! Sarah, I don't wanna fight in public! You don't have to go with him! What he just did is not ok! This is between us, Nikki. Not anymore. Remember what I said, Sarah. She is jealous and she's squeezing her way in. This is exactly what I predicted, isn't it? Sarah, I don't care who you date. You can get in the car with him if you want, I'm still gonna be your best friend. I'm not going anywhere. But I am telling you, you don't deserve this. I'm scared, Nik. He won't let me go. Tough shit. Neither will I. Get in the car! Get in the car, Sarah! Get out of my way, Gus. Not a chance. It's ok. He can't hurt you. She loved him, too. Despite everything, she didn't want his life to be ruined. He hit her with a pool cue? We should go to the police. File charges. Maybe. I don't know. He needs some sort of consequence or he'll just keep doing it. Well, I'm not ready to ruin his life just yet. What about your mom? She'll be too disappointed. I couldn't handle it. No she wouldn't. She'd wanna lock the snake away and throw away the key. She'd be disappointed I didn't- I didn't bolt the first time he hit me. Hold up. No. No. Ok, look at me. This isn't on you. You didn't do anything wrong. You love him. I did. I loved him. And you know, that's what makes me so mad, is he's still there. He-he exists. This... this guy who is smart and-and ambitious and... and who made me feel like... like I was the best thing that ever happened to him. He's still there. And he still wants me. And I still want him. I know. I know, it sucks. But the one half of him can't justify the other, Sar. It's still who he is right now. Maybe always. Thank you. For being here. Still. Like you said. You don't give up on the ones you love. I'll go to his wrestling coach. Rob respects him. He'll know what to do, if anything. Maybe he can make him go to anger management. Yeah. He'll want to know everything, start to finish. A picture says a thousand words, right? Ok. ♪ Hold your bones up to the fire ♪ ♪ Let me see beyond your eyes ♪ Ok, hold it. Ok, just one more. ♪ Holding onto and I am waiting. ♪ Ok, turn around. ♪ All my love is getting tired. ♪ ♪ We were young back when we started. ♪ ♪ Getting further and I'm still waiting. ♪ Ok, I can't take anymore. I'm so sorry! ♪ It's burning down, it's burning down ♪ Relax. Gus says they don't have practise this morning. What if he comes in to train on his own? Sarah, he can't hurt you. Not with Mr. P right there. Plus, I know some moves. Mmm. You're lethal. Um... I think... I think I changed my mind. What? Everyone will know, Nik. Sarah, come on. Screw him, you're not the villain here, he is! Yeah, 'cause they'll believe me! You know what Jacqueline told me about Cara? She said she stalked Rob. That she was mental. They love him, Nik. My-my words won't matter. Sarah- It's my decision. Ok. You're right. What do you wanna do? Um... I wanna... I wanna pretend like this never happened and I wanna go home. ♪ It's burning down. ♪ ♪ It's burning down. ♪ ♪ There is nothing we can do now. ♪ Rob and I broke up. Sweetie. Is he seeing someone else? No. Well, it's just that yesterday I would have said that he would take a bullet for you. Seems like you're leaving something out- Yeah, I'm leaving lots out but I don't wanna talk about it. Sarah. I'm just not what he wants. And I don't wanna be with him if that's the case. I know it's disappointing. Hey. Hey, look at me. You have never been a disappointment. I'm sorry if I ever made you feel that way. You liked Rob. I felt like-like it made you proud that I was dating him. Ok, the other night you said some things- I was a little shit. Yes, you were. But some of them I needed to hear. You already recognized that you might not be right for Rob. Not what he wants. By the way, total, total, total madness. Yeah. You know, I... I really thought that Rob was the guy. Now I kind of hate him. No you don't. Why? Why shouldn't I be allowed to hate him? I just want to hate him. Hate gives him power over you. Look, you don't have to forget. You shouldn't forget. But you can forgive. You know? Yeah. I hope you two like spicy sausage! I hate spicy sausage. Why does she always do this to us? Alright. You would think she'd figure it out by now. That's for you guys. I'll grab some napkins. Mmm. And green peppers. It's like the worst. The worst pizza ever. Um, I'd like green peppers on my pizza, so no one ever... No one. Ok, next one. Alright. Let's go. I'm on a roll. I knew you'd pick it. Wait, wait, wait. Here you go. Oh, sorry, I had to. This is... You... it was actually perfect. Are you serious? Ok, I just... I can't believe you. I thought he'd pick it. It was really funny! It was extremely funny. Wow. Atta girl. That's the sixth time. Block him. If he doesn't stop I will. You're still wearing the ring. Oh, um... it's just 'til I give it back to him at school. Or you could incinerate it in the fires of Mount Doom? Thanks for the empathy. On that note, we need snacks. Ooh, ooh, I want a muffin. Sar? Nah, I'm good. Some of us can't eat constantly. What do you fell like? Uh, chips please. Chips? And a coffee please. Rob wants to see you. I'm sure he does. You're hardcore wrecking him and yet for some reason he won't shut up about you. Yeah, I can't even be mad at you, Jacqueline. He's got you wrapped around his little finger. Sarah! Wait! Look, are you ok? Why haven't you been at school? My mom wanted me to stay home. Did you tell her? I told her we broke up. I need to talk to you. In private. Just come for a drive with me. Zach's in the car, he'll chaperone. What could you possibly have to say? I just- If she won't go for a drive with you, Robbie, I will. I bet I can take your mind off things. What do you think, Sar? Jacqueline wants to go for a drive with me. Fine. You can drive me home. We'll say goodbye. And then that's it. Ok? After this we... we move on. Let it all go. Agreed. I'll let it all go. Is-is that Jacqueline? Is he ok? What's going on? He and Alexa broke up and he's handling it poorly, so I'm keeping an eye on him. I should text Nikki you're driving me home. Oh, and how thrilled will she be about that? Come on. Stop it! You took the wrong exit. No I didn't. You said you were driving me home. You said I was taking you home. I'm taking us for a drive. Hey, Miss C. Hey. What're you doing here? I came to get Sarah. I thought she was with you. No. You were the last person to see her yesterday, Jacqueline. You're positive she said she was going home? That's where they said they were going. They? Yeah, she left with Rob. Sarah, ok, I'm not mad. Please just call me back, ok? I just need to know that you're ok. Nikki, hey. Is she at school? No, but one of her friends saw her leave with Rob from the cafe. Yeah, that's pretty much what he told me. Him and Zach drove her home. You've spoken to Rob? He's here. I called him. He said that he dropped her off here at 6:30, but Nikki, something is wrong. It just feels wrong, you know? This isn't like her. She's not answering her phone, she hasn't left a note, this isn't like her. Miss C, there's something I have to tell you and I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. Rob's not who you think he is. He hit Sarah at the dance. I saw it, Gus saw it. And he hit her once when she visited him at home. And she's got-she's got bruises all over her body. I took pictures of them and they're on her phone. She just-she didn't want me to tell you and I'm really sorry, I should have told you. I should have told you. Ok, um... you did the right thing. I'll call you back. She's not at school? Uh... Nikki asked around and nobody has seen her. Rob, was she unhappy when you left her? Actually she had mentioned that she was feeling claustrophobic. That she needed a break from school and... from Nikki. Right, so you think that she may have run away? It's a possibility. Oh god. If you think it's something she might have done... I want you to leave. Why? Nikki brought me up to date on the nature of your relationship with my daughter. Laura, I love Sarah and Sarah loves me- So you never hit her? No! You never threw her down at your house? You never smacked her at the dance? If that's what Nikki's saying then she's lying! I would never hurt Sarah- Don't you dare twist this around on Nikki! Don't do it! Rob. Do you know where my daughter is? No. I don't. Rob, do you know where she is? No. Then get out. Get out! Was Sarah happy? Tell him what you told me. Um... her boyfriend-- ex-boyfriend-- Rob Tennison, he was violent. He hit her. He got angry at her a lot. Miss Collins, were you aware of Rob's alleged behaviour? No, Nikki just told me. So she did keep secrets. We'll confirm Mr. Tennison's whereabouts but in these types of cases the missing teen has often run away of their own accord. We will reach out to his family and take a statement. So what're we supposed to do? Let us do our jobs. You know, make calls, check in with family or anyone she might visit. Be patient. Can you do that? No, I don't think we can. He's here. You wanna tell us why you've been skipping school, man? Look, I don't see why you care. Hey! You were one of the last people to see Sarah, Zach. I already gave my statement to the police. Ok? We dropped her off at home. Except you didn't. Look, I was wasted. I barely remember anything Well, you remember enough to freak you out. Make you avoid school. Look, it was all a blur. I thought Sarah was with us in the car when we drove to the lake house but I passed out and when I came to, she wasn't. Rob told me that we dropped her off at home before we even drove out there, man. But you don't believe him. Her purse and phone were still on the front seat of the car. Look, I swear, I thought he just ditched her, you know, to teach her a lesson or something, you know? You need to tell the police. No, are you crazy? He's going to kill me! Zach! Please. She started doing her own laundry and I thought... I thought hey, she's growing up. But uh... no, she just didn't want me to see the blood and I should have. Nikki, where are you? Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! Laura. Don't touch it. She was wearing that at the cafe. I got pissed at her for wearing it. Sarah. Sarah. u can't do this! Robert Tennison. You are under arrest for the murder of Sarah Collins. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. Do you understand the rights just read to you? Excuse me! Excuse me! Sweetheart, sweetheart, we'll get a lawyer, alright? All rise. Please be seated. Originally, Mr. Cahill, you supported Rob's statement. That you dropped Sarah off at her house, correct? Yeah. Y- yes, but I was scared and I was confused. Just for the record, Mr. Cahill, were you drunk on the night in question? Yeah. Yes, ma'am. Did you pass out at any point? Long enough, say, to have missed seeing Sarah exiting Rob's car? Yes, but when I woke up I knew something wasn't right. Yo. You're leaving your girl behind? What? Sarah, isn't she coming with us? Dude, you're wasted. I dropped Sarah off two hours ago. Uh, you got something to say, Zach? Nothin', man. She just left her purse. He couldn't let her go. Wouldn't let her go. He couldn't let her go, that's exactly right. Rob Tennison was rejected by Sarah Collins, but rather than give up, he drove her to a remote location. What're we doing here? I'm-I'm texting my mom to come get me. Let's go take a walk. Rob, if you wanted to talk you could have done so. In the car, while you were driving me home as I asked. You remember our weekends here? But they mean nothing now. Did you ever really love me? Yes. I really did. I thought you were the one. The one that I would be with forever. Sarah, please. Let's try again. I'll get help. I'll go to anger management classes or something- No, Robbie. I'm sorry. You're still wearing the ring. Um... That has to mean something. I- I was just waiting for the right moment to give it back to you, so... You'll find love again. We both will. I- it can't just over like- like it's nothing! Robbie, we're going in circles. It's time to go. How do I know you won't spread lies about me? Huh? You'll make people think the wrong thing. Rob. You're hurting me again. I- I won't tell anyone, I promise. You broke my heart. I don't wanna see you fall in love with anyone else. You promised to be mine. I can't let you go. No... no... no... I wish I told someone. Even if it cost me Sarah's friendship. She'd still be here if I had. Why would Sarah even get in that car with him if she was so afraid? Why didn't Miss Farrow tell you? Nikki? Nikki Farrow, look at me right now, ok? This is not your fault. It's not your fault. Don't let anybody make you think that it is. Miss Collins, it was never my inten- Ok, just look at him. I mean, you're all looking at her. Well, I mean right now you're- you're saying well, why didn't she tell anyone? Why didn't she walk away? If she had she would still be alive. You're looking at her and you are blaming her. Stop doing that. Look at him. Blame him. Please be seated. Rob Tennison. In the murder of Miss Sarah Collins I must find you guilty of all charges. Between the year 2001 and 2012 we lost 6,488 souls in battles fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. But during that same time period, 11,766 women were killed, but by their own partners. This is a war that we, in this country, refuse to address. It has to stop because things have gotten so dire that this is what a victory looks like and I am sorry folks but today was no victory. This case should not be closed, because when it comes to domestic violence there needs to be change on a cultural level and that change needs to start with each and every one of you. ♪ I've never seen this on your face, ♪ ♪ The more I draw the less you care, ♪ ♪ I've been around ♪ ♪ for quite some time, ♪ ♪ I'm not ready to let you leave, ♪ ♪ For all it's worth, ♪ ♪ I still believe, We can work, ♪ ♪ We can work this out, ♪ ♪ But I'm drunk, and it's late, ♪ ♪ I've been looking for your face, ♪ ♪ All you care is that she is now living for your stare, ♪ ♪ I don't exist anymore, ♪ ♪ I'll never see the light of day, ♪ ♪ The more I try, the more you fade, ♪ ♪ We won't work, ♪ ♪ No, we won't work this out, ♪ ♪ Who would ever guess ♪
