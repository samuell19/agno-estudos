You smoke a lot, don't you? You need to quit smoking. And also refrain from salty food for a while. I'd like to see you again in 10 days. Don't forget. Did you hear me? Hi, Mr. Mo! How are you? Going to work? Yeah. I'll be on my way. Written & Directed by LIM Dae-hyung BARBERSHOP BARBER LICENSE Geumsan MO Hi, Mr. Mo! Excuse me. Guys in this family will starve to death without me. Here. What is this? Some side dishes. Is this my brother's idea? You think I'm some servant? If I accept this, I would have to repay you. Sorry, I don't want it. What's wrong with you? What? What do you mean, what? You upset my wife. You don't have to repay family, just take it. Am I right or am I right? And I'm still considered a customer! Stop smoking! Brother, please stop smoking. What's today's date? It's the middle of the summer! It's scorching hot and I'm sweating my balls off! I think you should go to a bigger hospital right away. I can recommend one, if you like. Do you have any relatives that live in Seoul? Hey. How are you doing? Me? Nothing special. No particular reason. Just because it's the end of the year. How about Stephen? Is he giving you any trouble? You should visit sometime. Are you busy? Son, what are you doing? Wanna go see Dad later? Here, look at the camera. Stephen, what's Dad doing? Isn't he a handsome man? You must be tired from playing outside. My son's such a handsome boy! You could become an actor if you wanted! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Say it to Dad, too. TEA ROOM Hi, Mr. Mo! Hello, Mr. Mo! Let's go have a glass of beer. Hmm? Well... I'm a little tired today. Do you like plants? Not really. Try growing some fleshy plants. It's pretty rewarding because... it doesn't require as much work as other plants. It even grows well in dry environment. It's a native plant of Southern Africa somewhere. I think you'd really enjoy it. I've been growing it for about 5 years. I'm talking too much, aren't I? That's okay. If you don't wanna hear about plants, you can just tell me. It's interesting. You see! I knew that we'd connect somehow! I'm a pretty good judge of character. I don't mean to brag in front of you but, don't you just get a sense for those things through life experiences? I just need one glance and I'll know. You know, like, if I would get along with this person or not. But not that person. You know? I'm somewhat of a physiognomist. Let me see your face. You are a lonely person. Am I being arrogant? No, not at all. Ah! Leaf planting! Planting leaves in vases, you know what that is? No idea. If I were to explain... This stuff doesn't bore you, right? Since a fleshy plant is so tenacious that, if you pluck just a leaf and put it in soil, it takes care of the rest all itself. That's what leaf planting is about. Interesting, isn't it? Have you always been a man of few words? My wife taught me that. Oh, wow, she taught you pretty well... Sounds like she's a fun person. This is fun. Does she go swimming as well? No. Do you prefer facing the wall when you drink here? This spot is the most comfortable for me. I see. Ah, you're right. It is really comfortable looking at the wall. Nice. I'll be going in now. Thank you for walking me. What is your name, miss? My name is Ja-young. Ja-young... Yes. Have a good night. See you tomorrow at the pool! Your son's a real gentleman. Keep your head up straight. What do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna be a cop. How come? Cause I wanna make lots of money. Come on, that's not really why you want to be a police officer. I wanna catch thieves and protect the Earth. What about you, mister? One two, three, four. To your left, five, six, seven and forward, eight. One, two, three, four. I heard you had a drink last night. With the bank teller girl. Surprise! What was his name again? He was an American movie actor... Smoked like this. You know? I can remember his face, but not his name. Which reminds me of a different person. He was a marine. That guy smoked like this. He smoked like this even when he was alone. So, I asked him why he kept smoking like that. Just a habit, he said. Habits are a scary thing. Don't you think so? Meet you at home. It's cold. Okay. Where have you been? Here and there. I've been doing alright. What do you mean here and there? Just. Dad called. Your Dad? Or my Dad? Why did he call? He told me to come visit with you. Ah, I told him not to call you. I'm gonna go wash up. You're really persistent, aren't you? What are you doing these days? You don't wanna do movies again? Let's just pretend like we're going on a vacation. We've never gone on a vacation before. Sounds good. Can I have one? Go buy your own. Hello! You came. Yes. Come sit down. My hair's not that long. It looks pretty long. You know I got a perm. So what's up, Dad? I heard you refused the food that aunt brought you. Uncle told me about it. Her food is too salty. You know that they care about you. You should be a little nicer to them. Why do you have to be such a grinch? Why? So why did you want me to come? It's almost the anniversary of mom's death. It's still some time away. Delivery! Oh, I remember now. Remember what? The actor's name. Huh? What are you talking about? The American actor's name. Remember the guy I said that I can remember his face but not his name? Ah ha... Aren't you curious? What's his name? Forget it. You don't really care. What are you talking about? I'm actually curious. Look, bb pellets! Do kids still play with bb guns these days? When I was a kid, I used to go around picking up these bb's. This entire place used to be just forest. Just trees and some graves. We used to have bb gun fights and take naps on those graves. Thank you. What's this? My scenario. Let's make a film. Isn't that what you guys do? Is this why you called us? Can you shoot a movie with this camera? Dad, this so abrupt. Stephen MO! When did you get here? Yesterday. How's aunt doing? Just fine. Are you a movie director? I'm not sure. It's not easy, is it? When's your debut film going to be? Huh? Your father said you made a film. I won't be showing it for some time, yet. Where are you off to? Over there. Uncle. Has my Dad been behaving strangely, recently? Of course. He's always been like that. Yeah, I guess you're right. Hold on a second. No, no, no. Just a minute! - What do you mean, no? - No, it's okay. Oh, be quiet! Here. - There you go. - Thank you, uncle. You should come visit us too! Of course. See you. Take care. Sure thing. Why is this calendar so outdated? Is it? Get him a new one. I wonder how he came up with that idea for the scenario. Don't worry about it. Does he like Charlie Chaplin, by any chance? Chaplin? He wouldn't know who he is. You never know. We even learn about him in school. Why don't we give it a try? It sounds like fun. I'll even touch it up a bit with him. I don't wanna do it. I really liked the scenario though. Wanna go for some tea? It's on me. Well, that's new. It's somewhere around here. My father wanted to become an actor when he was young. An actor? Yeah, he lived in Seoul at the time. I didn't know he used to live there. This is where he first met his would-be wife. He still stops by here once in a while for some black tea. Tell me in chronological order. So your father lived in Seoul? Yup. And he learned to cut hair in Seoul as well. And all throughout he would audition to try and become an actor. He likes to say he's a Seoulite even though he's only lived there briefly. I see. Wait, don't crack the egg yolk. Just drink it whole. Don't scoop it up with the spoon, just gulp it down. Says who? You're kidding me. That's the way to have it. I'll have it however I want. Dad was a very bright person before mom passed away. Ah... She passed away about 15 years ago when I was ten. I see. I told you not to crack the egg yolk. That's what people have been doing since they first started putting eggs into a black tea. This black tea is filling. I'm full, too. THEATER Dad! You're here? Where have you been? What's all this? Don't you call them props? Sir... A thought came to mind after reading your scenario. Do you, by any chance, like Charles Chaplin? Is that the impression you got? Am I right? You know who Chaplin is? Charles Chaplin. My wife was very fond of him. Oh, she was... How romantic... Who are your favorite actors? Kirk Douglas. Charlton Heston, John Wayne, Yul Brynner, Alain Delon. Charles Bronson. Lee Van Cleef. Lee Van Cleef was a really good bad guy. Stephen is just like you. Ingrid Bergman, Catherine Deneuve, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Fonda. Sophia Loren. Sophia Loren was a glamour star. What's this? My movie premieres at Christmas. You are cordially invited to preview of a movie by Geumsan MO Listen, I'll reference what you wrote down for me and... organize the parts we discussed about. - Okay. - I don't know what to make of this. What is your intention? Are you trying to torture me? You're doing this on purpose, right? - Is he really your son? - Okay, fine! I'll do it. But why do you have to shoot it in Seoul? The location probably has a symbolic meaning to it. The location does have a symbolic meaning to it. And some people I want to meet as well. Like who? Will you please just spit it out all at once? You don't have to know everything in advance. Can't you fall asleep? You're still awake. Listen. I'm a little concerned. If there's anything I should know, you should tell me. Are you holding any secrets? Doctor says I'm a sick. What? I can't really believe them because they're only just a health center, but they say I've got stomach cancer. HIGHWAY EXIT Here we are! Come on out. I think I'm gonna go crazy. Wow, a popcorn bomb? How did you come up with such a brilliant idea? Sweetheart, do I just sprinkle it like this? Yes, that's good. Director, are you aware that we won't be able to shoot at night without any light? Don't call me a director. (Wanna die?) Cut! Let's have one more go. Towards the end you forgot to raise your head and smile. We gotta do it one more time, anyway. I think I forgot to press the REC button. Mr. Barber! Haircut! Haircut! Who were you planning on meeting in Seoul? Why do you always just go silent whenever you feel uncomfortable? Who is it? A woman that I once met when I was young. A woman? Dad, why are you behaving like this? Please. Now's the time to tell us. What? What must he tell? Please. Hey, miss! Yes? Where'd he go? Who? The barber! You guys are close to each other, right? I guess you can say so. Although I'm not so sure anymore. Let's go to the hospital tomorrow. What do you plan on doing with this movie? Quit if you don't wanna do it. I think I can do it without your help anyway. And after you're done shooting? You'll go to the hospital, right? Well, then, I'm quitting here, too. Like father, like son. They're so stubborn. Please... A movie director should be shooting movies. How did you find out her home address? You said you met her when you were a young man. We exchanged letters once in a while. When mother was around, too? She would've felt bad if she found out. She knew. Then why didn't you live with her instead of mom? Why did you part with her? The spark faded, what can I say. Where did you reside in Seoul? All over the place. Miari, Songchondong. And then, Jongam-dong. Imun-dong. Jangwi-dong. Euljiro, Jongno. We're in Seoul. Don't you wanna check them out? I have already. When? But all those places have disappeared now. I couldn't tell where I lived. And I don't know where was it. Hello? This is the residence of Yeon-Jung Park all right. And who are you? I was sent here by a friend of Yeon-Jung Park. And who might that be? Well... Mom! Just a moment. Mom! Hello? Are you Ms. Pank? Yes, I am. Do you know Mr. Mo by any chance? Go on inside. - Why? - Hush! I don't want to go in. What is it? Go. Inside. What's this? Mr. Mo is having a movie screening on Christmas this year. He would love for you to be there. Oh, I see. The invitation will tell you the date, location and everything. You and Mr. Mo... Are you related? Ah, I forgot to introduce for myself. I'm his son. When I... was cleaning his room, I discovered a letter from you. I'm lucky to find that you still live here. You have a nice home. Well, I'll get going now. Who is he? Did she go inside? Not yet. She's still looking over here. Just go. Cut! Dad, you have to come to this spot. I've told you repeatedly. Okay. You think you can do it? That lady. She cried. Really? Yeah. Maybe she thought about Mr. Mo 'cause she looked at you. Go to bed. You drank too much. Uh huh. You think my Dad will be alright? Uh huh. What about you and me? Are we gonna be okay? Uh huh. Is that a yes or just a sound? Uh huh. I needed some time to think. Whether I'm a guy capable of making you happy or not. You like traveling overseas, you wanna go study abroad... Why should that be your concern? My happiness does not depend on you. You're afraid of too many things. You imagine too many strange things. You were listening? I feel dizzy. I'm going to bed. When did she pass away again? Christmas. Ah... Christmas. Stephen. Yes. I'm not sleepy, Dad. Don't be surprised. Do you know who named you? You said Mom did. That woman you saw in Seoul did. She was the one who gave you the name you have. She was a devout Catholic. But she had to run away when she gave birth to you at nineteen. We were young and incapable, then. If you're trying to detach yourself from me, then you've succeeded. Is he still mad at me? Maybe... He didn't come home last night. Let's do one more take. Are you alright? I tell you what. We'll make sure to complete your movie and screen it. I can promise you that. But you must keep your side of bargain. You're a wonderful girl. What a fool. One for Seoul. The last scene... towards the end you forgot to raise your head and smile. We gotta do it one more time, anyway. I think I forgot to press the REC button. Get some sleep now and continue it tomorrow. Did you hear me? The cuts flow nicely. The cuts flow nicely... Where is the barber? Take this, please. What's this? It's an invitation. Mr. Mo is having a screening for his movie. A movie? Hello. Oh, I'm cold. Excuse me! Yes? It's an invitation to a movie that opens on Christmas Day. What kind of movie? It's a short film featuring a man who used to come here to swim. Did you get some sleep? Yeah. Drive carefully. Remember, you have no insurance. I'm gonna stop by home real quick. Anything you want me to bring? Well... I'll text you if I think of anything. Ryan Gosling. I see. Tell your father I'll stop by to see him when I go to Seoul. Yewon? Huh? Thank you. Me, too. Is there anything I can help you with? There's a little kid who was really good at greeting people for no real reason. I think he might grow up to become an idiot. He needs to fix his bad manners and habits. December 12th My sister in law's food is too salty. So salty that you'd have to give them a good rinse in running water. December 13th I was eating some popcorn and one went down the wrong pipe. It feels like popcorn is stuck in my stomach. I miss my wife. December 14th The guy who runs the chicken joint seems a bit slow. He's gonna die buried in books. December 15th I saw my wife in my dream last night. She stroked my head, and I cried like a baby. "You poor man." I think that's what she said. December 16th It's cold. I smoked all day long. While I was brushing the dust off the Christmas tree, I yelled out "son of a bitch!" I can't believe I cursed at some dust. December 17th There are a lot of interesting people at the swimming pool. Old guy that leaves after doing some warm-ups. Women who can't mind their own business. Ja-young is a lonely girl. A lonely person. December 19th Sweetheart from Seoul. Stephen may be my son but he is stupid. I don't know why this wonderful girl chose to meet my son. To be fair, any woman that has eyes will like handsome men. That's what my wife did. She said, "The only reason why I live with you is because you are a handsome guy." I ended up becoming a handsome, but impotent guy. December 23rd It's been 15 years since you left. Can you believe it? What kind of man was I to you? Why? Ah ah. Hello everyone. The show will begin soon. Please be quiet. I'm the director of the movie you're going to see today. And also the protagonist, Mr. Mo's son. Please do not kick the seat in front of you. And turn off your mobile phone. Yes, uncle. Where's your father? I'll tell you where he is after the show. Well everybody, please enjoy the show. Merry Christmas. THE MAN WHO SWALLOWED A HANDMADE BOMB Actor: Geumsan MO Director: Stephen MO Cinematographer: Yewon PARK FALSE ALARM
