She's got Amber's look in "The Playhouse" No! Shit! Jenna from "Backdoor Friends" No "Big Titties 4" It's really sick how you know the titles of all those movies "I Fucked Jenna" That's the 70s spoof of the TV show "I Dream of Jeannie" They called it "I Fucked Jenna" That's it! That's gotta be it! You need to see a doctor. Listen. Some people view pornographic films as pieces of garbage. I view them as pieces of education that should be bestowed on every heterosexual male when he turns the age of eighteen. Like when you go to vote they should be like "Here's your ballot" and give you a copy of "Juicy Asses" I think it's that point in our relationship where we start talking about you. Well I know my biological clock is ticking and you just turned red! You! you are beautiful! Oh, thank you! Perfect day just to father 2.3 kids. What's wrong with .3? Nothing! It means we have a dog and we're constantly working to get a third. Golden retriever. A black lab. German shepherd. That works. Two and a half baths. Three. Three? Trust me! With two teenage daughters running around you'll be really happy we have it. Okay well, you know now that we have that all figured out what's next? I don't know. Do we get a life insurance policy in place? Yeah, I'm covered. And how much? Are you planning on killing me or something? I will kill you if we don't get that third bath. And you call me overconfident? Yeah! Somehow the entire weekend you managed to keep focus on me kinda like a lawyer cross-examining her witness. Bingo! You're a smart man and you're an investment advisor for a wealth management company here in Red Bank. Yup And what was the name of that again? Arrowhead Advisors. Is that in the Galleria building? Yeah, it is! Why? That's where my brother-in-law works. Really? Mm-hmm Who is your brother-in-law? That would be your boss. Joe Barcia is your brother-in-law Yup Well that certainly makes things interesting. It could or it couldn't I guess, guess that's up to us, right? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Scott? Hey, what's up? No tie? Aren't you supposed to be taking your Series 7 right now? Yeah I rescheduled it. In my office. Now. What's going on with you? Nothing. Scott. I'm not ready. Yes you are. No, I'm not.

Not as good as you, though. You'll be better. I'm sorry, did you see your numbers last quarter? Yes, I did, and half of those accounts I couldn't have closed without your help. You've got to get out of my shadow. You're right. I know Let's make a deal. You take the exam and I'll make sure Barcia approves your trip to Toronto. Really? That's right. Burke! How are ya? Morning, Scotty. Morning, Joe. Weren't you supposed to take your Series 7 today? I, uh, I asked him to move it to next week so he could help me close some old accounts. Which, by the way, Joe I was wondering if you could approve Scott to come to Toronto with me? If you think it's necessary. I wouldn't ask if I didn't think it was. Yeah. I'll put in a request, we'll see what we can do. You have your racquets in the car? Always do. Good! Loser buys dinner. Steakhouse, Creamed spinach Little tomato and onion salad I can taste it right now you better bring a pocketful of cash. Oh yeah, well you better bring your Black Card then. Black Card this You're gonna lose. Oh. End of the month? Let's make some money, huh? Yeah, sure Joe. Yeah Get the fuck outta here. You better fucking kick his ass and leave him in his little pink underwear. What? So how was the weekend, Burke? Pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah You got some, didn't you? Kinda. Kinda? Why don't you tell Papa all about it, huh? It' good to hear stories every now and then Perfect place for it, a locker room. So talk some locker room to me. You okay? Oh yeah. Great uncomfortable little itch that I can't get rid of it's growing back. I'm putting in a promotion for you, Burke. No way. Yeah way. How does Senior Director of Account Management sound? You're shitting me. I shit you not. Gonna call HR put in the paperwork Usually takes about two to three weeks. Done deal. Thank you! No problem, Burke. Keep it stiff So part of the promotion means you're gonna be absorbing other accounts. Most of them are ones that I opened. Some of them are from like twenty years ago when the company first started. The newer ones would be like Stephen Bower uh, Dominick Grillo, you know... Did you say Dominick Grillo? Yeah. Dominick Grillo. Like the mobster? Oh, come on Burke.

There's one guy though that I want you to close. You're gonna take a small hit on your commission but eh, you make it up the following month. And? Little tiny hit Little baby hit. It's somebody we don't want to do business with anymore. And why don't we want to do business with them anymore?

Just go get rid of this shit please, alright? Come in! It's open! I found it. Don't you like just wanna stay in bed with me? Actually, I would love to stay in bed with you, but... Let's snuggle. People are waiting for me. Now do you see it? You think I look like Amber Lynn? Wait, You know who that is? This is "The Misogynist" right? The one where she keeps having sex with all of her clients but can't find true love? Wait, wait you know this movie? I don't think I look as much like her in this one. More like that one that was a TV spoof? "I Fucked Jenna" "I Dream of Jenna" Yes, that' it! "I Dream of Jenna" Oh my God! I think I love you! Jonathan you need to marry this girl right now. You think you're the first guy thats told me I look like her? Well, no. It's just that I thought... Would you believe me if I told you I even have her tattoo? Wait, what? What what are you telling him? Now you can't just say that and expect me not to ask To see it? Oh, no Andy. Only the good guys get to see it. See what? Nothing. Wait wait wait. What? Three minutes Ooh, that's Sheila. So, do you still live in the city? I actually just moved to South Jersey last month. Why? Cause I just got out of a pretty bad relationship. It wasn't that bad. I practically left the guy at the altar. How is that not bad? I understand with the whole you know breaking up before marriage Stuff like that. Understanding. Probably wasn't fucking you right. What is wrong with those movies? You obviously watch them. No I don't. Then how do you know so much about them? After being told that you look like someone for so long you think, What the hell? Let me see what all these guys are talking about. Okay. Those movies are degrading to women. I agree, which by the way for the record is why I came out of that phase. Whoa whoa whoa Hold your vibrators, ladies. How is it degrading to women? They make more money than men. The reason that women are paid more in the industry is because of everything that they have to go through, Andy. Everything they have to go through? All they do is lay there and get banged all fucking day. Gross. Men have to go through everything between setting up the cameras the lighting remembering their lines and we have to be hard as soon as the director yells Action! Oh. Okay, so you actually think that women enjoy having sex that lasts longer than seven minutes. Who wouldn't? Really? You've seen Ron Jeremy, right? That man is an icon. That man needs a waxing. Mmhmm. How about Peter North? Didn't he do gay porn? Randy West? Oh, he's so beautiful with his yellow afro and his basketball in his stomach. I mean, I don't even know how he got into this industry. Look, the bottom line here, Andy is that women make more in that industry because those movies are geared towards men who believe that women are supposed to look like goddesses. I mean, who's on the cover of those films? Not men. Thank you! You're welcome. Why haven't you made partner in your firm yet? Oh, I did. What? I found out this morning. Holy crap, that's great! Congrats! Maybe she can help you with your problem. Well, I'm gonna go outside and have a smoke. Okay I'll be right there. Please don't. What's he talking about, Jonathan? Nothing. It's far from nothing Where are you going? Why are you dickin' out now? That's where you need to slow down, buddy. What? Your sister's husband is blackmailing your boy here. Will you shut up, Andy? Jonathan. I don't want to talk about it right now. Well excuse me Did we just meet or something? Okay Barcia's got me closing an account cause the guy's a porn star. The great Kevin Steele You wanna talk about a guy who can bring down the hammer? So how's he blackmailing you? Barcia told him that he's gonna promote our boy to Senior Director but he hasn't put the paperwork through. Sometimes those things take time. Five months? Andy! Let's not forget that he won't promote Scott because he's black and gay. Is this true? Yeah. He told me down in Baltimore. Then why didn't you tell me about it then? Wasn't the right time. Do you have proof that he's blackmailing you? Not really But that's where you come in! Not necessarily! What? Don't tell me you would honestly ask me to represent you in a case against my own brother-in-law? Absolutely! Andy! Shut up! Jonathan! It crossed my mind. Well, do me a favor and uncross it. But what if I had the evidence? But you don't. But what if I did? When you do we'll talk We'll talk? What's that supposed to mean? Oh come on, don't do this! Don't do what? Don't make this into more than it already is! More than it is? You're not the one being harassed every day, being told how important you are to the firm. Be a company man! Be five steps ahead of yourself! You're not the one who has to listen to this shit day in and day out. Forgive me for expecting my girlfriend to support me. Well what do you want me to do? Don't blow me off! I wasn't blowing you off! I just think that if you're gonna accuse your boss of blackmailing you, you need to have substantial evidence And I'm asking you if I did will you help me? Jonathan. It's a simple question. It depends on what you have. Okay. Not even 24 hours and already she's treating me like a partner What? Oh, remind me when the clock stops so I don't get charged overtime later on tonight. You're an asshole! Jenna! Smooth talking. Yeah? Fuck you! Fuck me? Yeah! If you would've kept your mouth shut none of this would've ever happened! Oh, I'm sorry. Who's the dick in the room that can't stand up to his boss because he's banging his wife's sister? Oh! This coming from a guy who's had more opportunities to move up in his career and save himself from losing his parents house but would rather jack off to pornographic movies, who A) nobody cares about or B) cares that you actually respect them. What the hell are you talking about? Andy, you're forty years old! Why don't you step up to the real fucking world and be a man and get your own fucking place so I can stop carrying you! She's right You're an asshole. Hello? Hello, Burke. J.. Joe You wanna tell me why Scott is getting a commission check of $10,000 at the end of this month? Uh... I don't know, Joe I'm not sure why. I'll tell you why cause it seems he closed a deal with a client that has a pretty large portfolio and for some reason the name on the new account is Kevin Steele! Listen, Joe when I get back to the house I'll jump on the... Don't even bother cause I closed the account and when you two yahoos get back from your trip to Toronto you need to fire his ass! You understand me don't ever do this to me again, Burke! Listen, Joe. It's not his fault. Okay? It's not his fault Joe? Joe! Joe! Fuck! Man, I am pumped! How do you wanna handle this first one? You want to take the lead and then I'll jump in? Alright. Gotta breathe Phew Okay, I'm good, You okay? You've been acting weird ever since we got on the plane this morning. I'm fine. No, you're not. Come on, we have some time. What is it? I got some bad news. Already? I..I don't know how to do this... What? Barcia, he wants me to fire you when we get home. What the hell are you talking about? I just passed my Series 7 I'm out here doing everything you told me to do. He found out what we did with the Steele account. I'm taking the hit for it? Believe me, Scott. When he called I could not get a word in. I'm sure he can't fire the new Senior Director, huh? No, that's just it I'm not the Senior Director. Come on, man I was there when he said it. It's bullshit, Scott! He won't promote me until I close the Steele account. Fucking guy is doing everything wrong and I can't do a damn thing about it. I-I'm so sorry, Scott I don't know what to do! Listen. I know you wouldn't screw me on purpose It's okay. No! No, it's not okay! Forget about it, let's just get our game faces on and crush these meetings and then we'll go out tonight and you'll feel better. What? Wha.. Wha How? Trust me. It's a drag show, huh? Hope you're performing Cute Follow me. Now what can I get you guys? Vodka cranberry for me and two shots of Jack! Blue Harvest Two shots of Jack, huh? It's gonna be that kind of night. Trust me.

Sometimes in life you may have thought you saw something that you probably shouldn't have saw. Or maybe you didn't see it at all. Uh, a little something to help you forget. What'd I see, Joe? Don't play games with me, Burke You think you're gonna hold this above my head for the rest of your life? Not my style. What's not your style? Hey! I did you a favor! I forgave Scott for the mistake that he made. Wasn't a mistake, Joe this company shouldn't give a shit what he does with his life Or yours. I heard enough. Guess what? The expense for the trip is still coming out of your commission! That's bullshit, Joe! Okay, you wanna know the truth? I told Scott to do it. And you know what? I would do it again Really? You really wanna go down this road, Burke? Ha ha What road would that be? The one that could get your ass fired. For doing what I think is right? What you think is right? I told you a long time ago you need to start thinking just a little bit bigger. So that means I stop being me? I'm not gonna be you, you know! Oh, Mr. Righteous one! What are you gonna do, you gonna go to the top of the mountains and shout how you saved some sleazebag porno actors life? Really, Burke? Really? Sorry to interrupt Jonathan, but Mr. Steele is in your office Guess you better go take care of it, huh? Mr. Steele, yeah, what brings you to the office today? You wanna tell me why my account is closed again? Sigh.
