Get the kids ready fast. - Are the kids ready? l committed myself to it as l thought it's just face make-up. Excuse me! - Now l have to do it on their bodies as well. l will be there. - l am doing it alone. l wonder where Krishna is. - Excuse me! A small help.. Ok. Ok. l'll do it on everyone. One by one.

She's asking you to speak on the dais. l see. So you want me to speak on the dais? l am very happy to see this dance performance. l liked the girl very much. - l know the fact.. ..that it's not the actors, but it's doctors.. ..who gave this dance performance. lt won't work out. Handling middle-class girls.. ..is a bit problematic. - When all the legs come together you get.. ..the harvest and in the same way when all the hands come together.. l will say her 'l love you' in just one week. Forget one week, you can't tell her that even in one month. Bet? - Bet. We invite GK group of companies' director.. ..Mr. Abhiram to come on to the dais.. ..who is donating 50 lakh rupees though the minister. Son, you are doing a great job. Give it to me. Are you the one who gave the dance performance? What! We can only raise our hands, but can't move them. Then why should you get the cheque? - That's also right. Why would l take the cheque that l won't get? Madam, call the girl who danced just now. - Janaki. Come here, Miss. Janaki. You performed really well. Come here. Son, give her the cheque. Where are the remaining hands? - Good one. Thank you. So how about a coffee tomorrow? l completed medicine recently. Here in the Bliss Organization l am working as a doctor. This fund-raising program was also for the same organization. Did you compose the dance yesterday? We were inspired by a Chinese dance. That was amazing. ls coffee good? - Yes, it is. lt would've been better if it tasted like coffee. Janaki, do you believe in love at first sight? Not at first sight, but may be love at the second sight? Janaki, l love you. You need not tell me your response immediately. Let us be friends first. lt will later turn into love. lt's just that simple. These are the guys who came for Miss. Janaki. For Janaki? But she has already left. And you are.. - l am Abhiram, Janaki's friend. l came from Hyderabad. - She came here a week ago. She admitted a child here who lost her mother in an accident.. ..and then she left. Didn't she come to Hyderabad? What happened, son? l am the one who is responsible for that accident. Come with me. ls Janaki your daughter? They are all my kids. Janaki is an orphan. She was about 4-5 years old. l found her crying at Karnool bus-stand. l called her near me and gave her a biscuit packet. You know what she did then? She didn't have even a single biscuit. She distributed it among the six kids with her. Then l thought of building a school like this one. And Janaki's help to build this school is immense. She sends a share of her salary every month. Sailamma, where is lqbal? - He's still there, sir. He didn't even have meals yet. lqbal, didn't you have meals? He is crying. Why are you crying? - l want to go. Where will you go? - To the jungle. To the jungle? Why? - l will join rebels. l will kill the person who killed my mother. Then police will send you to the jail. lnstead of that if you study well and become a police officer.. ..you are arrest that guy. You know who he is? He is the friend of your sister.. ..who admitted you in this school. Give him a shake-hand. Oh! l feel relieved like l cleared a huge debt. l am done with this. Now l've to solve the bike-problem. Hey, you! Couldn't you read what is written on the wall? Great respect! Actually l remembered this.. ..only after that l saw that. - l don't want to hear that. lf you piss there you have to be the wall-chair. - Get lost. l don't want to hear that. You have to be the wall-chair. Hey, will you make me wall-chair if l piss on the wall.. ..and a home-chair if l piss on a home? Go and study. l don't want to hear that. You have to be the wall-chair. No, l won't. What are you doing? - l am whistling. That's not how you whistle. Look here. You have to twist your tongue and whistle this way. You want to learn whistling? - Hey, pissed on the wall.. ..and isn't ready to be the wall-chair. - Hey! Properly. Lower. Even lower. She must've gone to Saraswati. They are just like sisters. She lives in Amaravati in Guntur. Here's her address. - What if she wouldn't have.. ..brought lqbal here? - Janaki doesn't tolerate.. ..any mistake that takes place in front of her eyes. She tries to correct it. What you do looks very simple, but it's great work. Please accept it. lt might be of your use. Thanks a lot, son. They broke my back. By this time l would've.. ..stolen the bike and had left this place. Where are you going now? - Amaravati. Amaravati means you have to go through Guntur. Purna is really a God, boss. He is God. Those poor helpless kids don't have parents. He is feeding them and giving them education. lf l had got such support when l was a kid.. ..l would've been somewhere else. Sister, l deserved that slap. Your bike is really great, boss. l don't know who made it.. ..but l can imagine how it feels when you ride it. Coin. Hello! - Hello! Abhi, where are you? - l met Mr. Purnachander. Janaki left this place a week ago. - ls that so? l enquired Deepa about her. She didn't come here. Where are you going now? - To where Janaki is. Abhi. Abhi. Abhi. Boss, pay the bill for these as well. Gali, you said you're about to bring a Hero Honda. There's no Hero Honda, uncle, but l have a better bike. Honda F4! Made in abroad. Made in abroad? - Yes. When you are bringing that bike? - He is coming Guntur. l'll get his bike before he reaches there. You are the real man. - Thanks for that.. ..but how much are you paying me for it? - Oh! Come on! Take 10,000. - 10,000 rupees? lsn't it a bit too much, uncle? - lt's alright. l am not giving this amount to an outsider, am l? You are like family. - Rascal, l fool others.. ..and you are trying to fool me? l'll put my gear-rod.. ..in your silencer. You will pay me 10,000 rupees.. ..for a bike worth twenty lakhs? Do l look like a fool? What makes you think that l would fall for that? Hey! Hey! l am your uncle. - To heck with relations. l sold you so many bikes. - What's this! You are using such abusive language? You were exploiting me all these days. Why are you going into the past? Gali. - You.. l am Gali and l am falling short of abuses to abuse you. Can you imagine it? - Listen to me. Take another 2,000 rupees for it if you wish. - You scoundrel! There are too many crooks in this state, boss. Oh God! They are always waiting for a chance.. ..to exploit others. Rogues. Boss, once upon a time there was scarcity.. ..of food and clothes in this country. But today there's a scarcity of good people. This country is going to pits.. You won't get more than that on selling this bike. Thanks for showing me the way. Uncle, fast. - Yes, coming. Hey, Karnool bus is about to arrive. Will the Kurma be sufficient? - Yes. Uncle, two egg bhurjis. - l told him. Hey, put four cots here. Hey, why are you getting up? - My bike. Oh! Your body is burning like a pan on the stove. Lie down. l'll bring medicines for you. My bag. My bike. They must be at the site you fell down. Shall l go there and check it out? You are lucky that l was there. lf someone else was there in my place.. ..he would've ran away with all your belongings. God hasn't made another guy like you. Why don't you go and bring that bhurji? - l'm bringing it. Thank you, Srinu. - There's no need to thank me. That's the reason l say one must have faith.. ..in fellow human beings. There's your bike.. ..and here's your bag, and l am wearing your goggles.. ..for the time being. - He's a thief, but not a crook. What's the difference? - He who mugs a stranger is a thief.. ..and he who mugs even an acquaint is a crook. You have it, son. - Uncle, first of all give him those tablets. He seems to be mad. He is talking to himself. O lord! Give me your blessings. l offer you my salutations. He's not a mad fellow. Today it's Vaishaka festival. lt's an important festival for them. lf we want to say something to someone close to us.. ..we can say it to the moon, the moon would convey.. ..the message to them. You lie down, son. Take good care of my parents and my children. Tomorrow l am coming. - Hello! One minute you wait. l'll talk to the moon for half a minute. Hey, uncle Macharam! l'll break your head.. ..when l come to Bezawada. You continue. Boss, this way of communication.. ..seems to be great, doesn't it? Both incoming and outgoing calls are free. We need not spend even a single paisa. Oh! - Are you blind or what! Rascal! Where is Janaki? - Check the temperature of the patient.. ..in room no. 4 every one hour. - Why are you avoiding me? Abhi! You can go now. - Ok. Damn! Damn! l've been trying to meet you since two days. Neither l get you here nor do l get in the hostel. l was on camp. - Goddamn! Can't you keep a cell-phone? l don't need that. And also, my life is not as busy as yours. How can l be busy anymore! You spoiled my life. - Me? Yes, you spoiled it. You know how busy l was earlier? Every night l used to attend minimum four parties. And l used to sleep at daytime. But now l can't sleep at daytime.. ..and l don't feel like going to parties at nighttime. Damn! Abhi. - l am unable to forget you even if l try to. Doctor ma'am. Doctor ma'am. - Go. Go. - How are you now? The pain has reduced, but l am feeling a bit weak. My knees are aching. l don't feel hungry. My waist is aching on lying on the bed for long hours. God! And what about me? - Oh no! You are still a kid. - What? What happened to you, son? l will send medicines. Have them. You'll be fine. Give some nice medicines to that kid as well. Janaki, where are you going? - Hello, doctor! - Hello! What's your problem? - You are my problem. Say 'l love you' to me urgently. - But l should feel that first. Feel it. - Abhi. Feel. Why? You didn't like me? How can any girl not like me? Power. Money. Status. GK's one and only son. l have everything. - All that's fine. But l must like you without those things. What do you mean? - Those things make you desirable.. ..but not lovable. - Doctor, patient no. 10.. ..is bleeding heavily. - l'll be there. Janaki. - Emergency. Ok, l'll be waiting in the car. Patient's safe. - When you took so long l knew that.. ..the patient would survive, or you would've returned soon. How can you say that! You know how valuable life is? Yes, one's life is valuable for one. Good shot. - She likes me, but she doesn't express it. Middle-class girls are just like that. Forget her. Not about her, but l am myself in a confused state of mind. What happened to you? l don't know. For the first time l am.. Hey, we had a bet just for fun. Don't take it so seriously. Now let's play. - No, man. lt's hurting. Abhi, there are three types of love. Love. Big love. Great love. The effect of love is for two months. The effect of big love is for two years. And if it's great love it would change your life. Ok, see you. - Hey, Janaki! Wait. Wait. Wait. You know what! There are three types of love. Love. Big love. Great love. Abhi, l have got some urgent work. l need to deliver these medicines. Ok, let's go in my car. - Ok, but l will drive today. What! You know what, Janaki! The effect of love is for two months. Big love for two years. And great love changes one's life. Oh! We could've come on the car. Car can't come into these lanes. Now what! Where? - l will be back in a while. What will l do till then? - Just enjoy. Hey! - Sorry. Can we go now? - Ya. Left. - Left? - Hey, careful. Can you ride it? Why are people so nasty here? l have seen the whole world. You know l have been to London, Paris, New York. l haven't seen such poverty anywhere. You have seen different places, but not the world. What is the difference? - lf you see life through.. ..car's window it would appear like watching TV. Get down your car just once and you'll understand.. ..what world is. - Whatever! Hey, stop here. Stop here. Get down. Come. - Here? This is world. l want two. Why are you laughing? - l thought you don't know.. ..how to help others, but you don't know how to eat as well. What's its cost? - 8,000 bucks. You could've bought 80 blankets with it. Why do you say l don't know anything? You don't know how to love. lt's alright; tell me you love me, don't you? You think about the same thing all the times? - Yes. l love you. - Abhi, what's this? l love you. - Ok, only if you repeat what l say. Say it. Say it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Love loves the love that loves unconditional love. Come again. Love loves the love that loves unconditional love. Ok, ok, ok. One second. Love comes four times.. Love loves.. Love is in love.. Love is unconditional.. Love is.. lt sounds like a tongue twister. Peter piper picked a peck of pickled papers. Peter piper picked a peck of.. - Shut up! She said it in Telugu. - l'll say it. l'll say it. l'll say it. Ninune Ninune Nanune Nanune. Nanune ninune. lt's not that. Something like love comes four times in it. Four times love. - Four. Four. Four. l'll say it. Four red lorries, four white lorries. Four red lorries, four white lorries. ''Why are you so lost?'' ''What happened to you all of a sudden?'' ''Stop worrying for no reason.'' ''You can enquire us about your doubts.'' ''You are with us, you are never with us.'' ''You are always daydreaming..'' ''..about something or other.'' ''There's something in my heart.'' ''lt's a beehive. Don't disturb it.'' ''l don't know what happened to me.'' ''You are in deep trouble.'' ''No doctor can cure this ailment.'' ''l am enjoying this pain.'' ''You are in love.'' ''She gets upset with me every second, but it's a lot of fun.'' ''That's why l fight with her every second.'' ''l am always waiting for him. l pamper him every minute.'' ''There are so many tiffs every second.'' ''No matter however long l am with him..'' ''..l can't get enough of love.'' ''We heard what you say.'' ''But what is the message from the sky?'' ''l saw her once, now l want to see her again and again.'' ''Go away, O uninvited silence. You are not needed here.'' ''Go away, O uninvited silence. You are not needed here.'' ''Make some excuse and leave this place.'' ''How long will be this strange dilemma?'' ''Move the story forward, O fate.'' ''When will the debate 'To be not to be' come to end?'' ''We are treading the new path.'' ''l might trip as this is the first time l'm walking on this path.'' ''l was here all these days.'' ''l wonder what happened to me after you came into my life.'' ''l am walking along with you.'' ''l don't know which direction l am heading towards.'' Hey, Narappa! Just because your boss is in Hyderabad.. ..if you mess with me here someone might be killed. You know who would die? Your boss. l'll talk to him, brother. l'll talk to him. Hey, scoundrel! See the person before spitting. Bring water. What are you waiting for? Come here. He asked me to see the person before spitting. Bring coffee for us. Go. - Ok, sir. What are you staring at! l'll slash your throat. What are you staring at! l slash your throat and then take it.. Hey, have you gone mad or what! Hey, you! Are you out of your mind! Brother. Brother. Brother. No, brother. Don't you know about Boyalodu? - No, l don't. You don't know about me? - Shut up! You don't know anything about him. Brother. No, brother. Get out of my way. - Listen to me, brother. You don't know the fear of death? - Brother, l beg you. No, brother. Please, brother. Brother, please. You don't know? lf l kill him you would know.. ..what the fear of death is. Shall l shoot him? - Shoot me. Shoot me. Come on, shoot. Shoot me, scoundrel. lf l pull the trigger.. - Brother, please. - You will die. Shoot me. Shoot me if you have the guts to shoot. l'm going to.. lt's working. Leave them. Give me the gun and get lost. - Leave them. There is no way l would miss you from this close. Ask your men to leave. Ask them to get lost. Go away. Go away. Go away. - Hey, let's go. Come. Come. l will also leave. - Not that way, but this way. Hey, stop at the down-road. l will meet you there. - Run. How much is it? - Whatever it is.. ..you must leave this place fast. Thanks. There's a great fire in you. Use it correctly. How much is the bill? - There's no need to pay the bill. You leave this place fast. Hey, you too leave. What if he had pulled the trigger then? Oh! l was following you to steal your bike. You know that. But still for a person like me.. You are not an ordinary person, boss. You can't search sister-in-law alone. l'll also come with you. l was born and brought up on streets, boss. You need not give me anything, boss. Just give me food two times a day and a little bit of trust. l will show you how a human being should be. Now you talked like a human being. He doesn't know about the human being inside him. He doesn't have anyone who would tell him that. You told him that by saving his life by risking your life. Srinu, it's difficult to get a chance to lead life.. ..like a human being. You got a chance. Now give up the ugly work you do. No, thanks, son. - Please accept it. Srinu, shall we go now? - Yes. What's this, uncle! How can you put spoons in the curry! Take it. - Srinu. He who serves you rice always speaks the truth. l'm telling you. You'll be a great person. O come on, uncle! Goodbye. He's our gun-sir! Sir, you want lift? Are you in police department? - No. Military? - No. - So you work in the gun repairing shop. What's your name? - Gali Srinu. How come there's such gun-culture here? Restlessness. The struggle for survival. People here think that they would get justice.. ..as soon as you hold a sun. The government doesn't do anything? lt conducts elections. People have become mere votes. lt's not that others don't take them seriously. The problem is that they themselves.. ..don't take them seriously. Shall l tell you something? No one trusts anyone here, boss. There is no trust here. There are two sorts of people, boss. Those who exploit and those who get exploited. Those who exploit contest in the elections. And those who get exploited vote for them.. ..and help them win. lf you sell your vote for hundred rupees.. ..the person who buys your vote won't stay quiet after.. ..winning the election, will he? He devours crores of rupees. lt's a fair deal. lt's a very fair deal. Stop the bike there. Thanks, Srinu. Goodbye. - Bye. Gun-sir started a good conversation.. ..about people, crores and votes. lt was great time-pass. Boss, if we start our bike here.. ..we will reach Amaravati in no time. ''The raindrop doesn't stay at the place it is born.'' ''lt doesn't know where it would reach.'' ''Yesterday would never come.'' ''Don't be so attached to the past.'' ''Tomorrow is a distant dream.'' ''A human being has thousands of forms.'' ''The stage would change in a blink.'' ''You better know world is a tough place to live in.'' ''lf you understand it you won't have any trouble in future.'' Boss, this is Amaravati museum. You will find huge swords and shields here. ''lt's a strange, strange world.'' ''There are many hidden mysteries in this universe.'' Where's Mrs. Saraswati's house here? Go straight. There's Amaralingeshwara's temple. Pray the lord and take left, and the last house in that lane.. ..is Mrs. Saraswati's house. Where's Saraswati's.. Boss, you ask her about it. ls this Mrs. Saraswati's house? - No, this is my house. She's my daughter-in-law. - Really? ls Saraswati's there at home? - Why would she be here? lt's daytime. You won't find her at home at daytime. Where is she? - A friend of hers came here.. ..and she went to a temple in Vaikunthapuram. - Friend? That doctor girl from city, who has no work to do at home.. Who are you anyway? - Gali Srinu. Old lady, how long will you chew betel leaves like a goat? You moron. - Oh God! Are you Saraswati? - No. Are you Saraswati? - No. Are you Amaravati's Saraswati? - No. Are you Saraswati? - No. She's not Saraswati. Then? - Padmavati. Srinu, Gali Srinu. Are you married? - No, l'm not. Then why are you praying him? l would get married soon if l worship him. l am also not married yet. - She went to the temple at the top. Boss, it's seems to be too high. l need to quit smoking. Earlier l didn't believe that God exists up there, but it's true. Saraswati, take the holy offering. Boss, Mrs. Saraswati. Are you Mrs. Saraswati? - Yes. Boss, sister Saraswati. ls the doctor girl here? Yes, she's here. - Where's Janaki? Janaki didn't come here. - What are you saying, sister! When l asked you if doctor is here you said she is here. Doctor means.. Shailu. You love her very much, don't you? You searched her at so many places. lf you love a person so much you will definitely get her. These are not God's words, but these are Gali's words. You'll get definitely sister-in-law no matter wherever she is. Janaki used to stay at our house as a tenant.. ..when she was studying medicine in Guntur. My father was very fond of girls who study. And she gradually mingled with us. l lost my father during that time. We knew that we didn't have any assets. But after his death we came to know about his debts. lt was very tough time for us. Janaki stood behind me.. ..and gave me courage. - You forget everything.. ..if you get someone to chat with. Did you cook the meals? l cooked the meals, mother-in-law. You can have lunch if you wish. - l'll eat lunch.. ..after l finish this. - Ok. - Hey, kid. You come with me. l'm coming. Let's go. Today we settled here in this way. And the reason behind it is Janaki. Janaki knows what life is. l can't believe that she left you.. ..for the reason that you are telling me. Gali, bring that cot over here in the shadow. Why are you still standing there? Put the cot here. Old lady is too arrogant. Die there. Why are you getting so angry? Sit here. Where are you from? - From my town. Really? You are from your town? Will you eat palm fruits? - Yes. You people don't have poor people's fruits. Did you come here for Janaki? - Yes. She's a nice girl. The doctor girl you saw this morning.. She doesn't know anything. She's a mad girl. Don't have palm fruits if you don't want to. At least have Chakkiris. l know you won't have our snacks. You only eat those packets. And yes, who is the guy who came with you? - He is.. How does it bother me! He is not ugly face like you. He seems to be from a good family. - Thanks. Granny, coffee. - Give me that coffee. At least have this coffee. l know you won't have our coffee. l will drink it. l will drink it. l will drink your coffee. Where must have she gone? - She must've gone to Bala sir. Who is Bala sir? - Bala sir conducts medical camps.. ..in agency areas. Janaki goes there every year. - Where? l can't tell you where exactly, but Mr. Bala lives.. ..in Narasipatnam. ln Narasipatnam anyone can.. ..tell you where Mr. Bala lives. Thanks. Mr. Abhiram. Why do you think Janaki has left? May be she didn't like my behavior and left in anger. Not with anger, but she must've left with faith in you. She must've left with the faith that you change yourself.. ..and go back to her. When we have a beautiful dream in our sleep.. ..we don't get up. We cherish that dream. But when there's a nightmare we get up. We wake up. ln the same way if there is no sorrow.. ..world would go to sleep. Only because of sorrows we got a Buddha. There were inventions and discoveries. Hello! ls Janaki there? - Yes, she is here. One minute. Abhi. Hello! - There's a party at my farmhouse tonight. You must come. - Party? No, l can't. Please it's my birthday. - Birthday? But you didn't tell me. - l'm telling you now. Many happy returns of the day. You must give me those wishes at 12 at night. No, Abhi. Only my close friends are attending.

''l am losing myself in my dreams.'' ''O beautiful moment, don't pass away.'' This farm-house is the first property.. ..my father bought on my name. Everything's here is mine. - lncluding that? What? - That. - You mean moon. lt's so beautiful. - Not as much as you are. lf you wish l will give it for you. ''He treats me like a doll.'' ''l feel like a lady when l am with him.'' ''l am following him in his path.'' ''l fear l might commit a mistake.'' ''O beautiful moment, don't pass away.'' ''O shyness, don't give in.'' - Stop. Where are you going! Where are you going? ''O beautiful moment, don't pass away.'' - Stop. Please. ''O shyness, don't give in.'' Wow! What a lovely scene! Hey, babe! Before you Abhi brought a number of girls.. ..to his bedroom.. - Jia. But it took him a long time to bring you here. Scoundrel, get out. - Hey, cool! Cool, buddy. Just shut up and get lost. - Cool. Abhi, let me tell her how much effort you put for her. For you her roamed in dirty labor areas. But your figure is not labor, it's superb. Hey, Abhi! Will l get a chance after you? Just shut up and get out. - Hey, don't get excited, man! We shared so many girls in the past, didn't we? So it's personal.. Use condoms. Play safe. Enjoy, buddy. Come on. Hey, guys! Listen to me.

Listen to me. - Hey, Abhi! What about me, buddy? Hey, Abhi.. - Janaki, please listen to me. ls it my fault if someone talks some rubbish? Don't be foolish. First of all know what happened. What the heck with you! Can't you listen to me once? - What will you say? Will you tell me what the bet on me was? That's not the thing, Janaki. - Abhi, find some empty car.. ..to talk to her. Don't disturb us. What! This is also my mistake? You are hurting me, Abhi. l need to go to the hostel. Oh! Ok, l betted on you. That is past. lt's over now. But now l am really in love with you. Scoundrel! Great! They are celebrating my birthday party.. ..in my absence. l brought you here unnecessarily. Do people recite devotional chants in birthday parties? Some guys drink and some jerks talk filthy. l went to such disgusting place for you. l went near drains, l went near dustbins.. For whom did l go to those places? Did l go there for my sake? l went to those places because l love you. l bore those laborers, that filth and that stink for you. That is my life, Abhi. - This is my life. How else do you expect late night parties to be? Why did you come here then in spite of knowing all that? l came here to say 'l love you' to you. l thought you love me. That's why l came here. Yes, Janaki. l really you. - This is not love. You love me, but not my soul. You could only see labor, dirt and filth.. But l live at such place. You don't know everything about me. What's there that l don't know? l know you are a medico, you are a social activist.. You are.. - lt's not that, Abhi. We are two different people. Our paths are different. - Foolish.

Who's this guy who stopped the vehicle.. ..in the middle of the road? Sir. Sir. - Why are you asking me to take it back? Ask him to take his vehicle back. Do l have to listen to him? Who is on the wrong side? You or me? - That's what l am also asking you. Who's on the wrong side? You or me? - Brother. Brother, please take your lorry back. lt seems that the baby has overturned. My wife's condition is critical. She has got labor pain. Take your vehicles back. Who can tell these guys! Why are you asking me to go back!

Take it back. He didn't understand it till an educated guy thrashed him. l am not educated. Take your lorry back. You didn't take it back till someone thrashed you. You wasted two hours time. What were you doing for two hours? Take it back. - There's no use. She will die. l know it. What did you say? - They take it back.. ..but that doesn't mean the vehicles will move right away.

How come you caught it? - There is one waste fellow.. ..like you in every house. What else do you do? - What else l do? l read Eenadu while having coffee. Andhra Jyoti in bathroom. l watch TV9 while having Tiffin. And while having juice l watch ETV 2. And then? - You didn't get what l do after that? l lie down and relax after that. Bus is going away, sir. Let's chase it slowly, sir. You go by foot. - How can we chase it by foot, sir! You're the one who wanted to chase it slowly. She doesn't have a brain, sir. Her body is filled with jewels. Fast. Fast. - Sir properly. - lt doesn't matter even if l die. The jewels shouldn't be lost, sir. - Shut your mouth. She doesn't have a brain, sir. Her body is filled with jewels. Faster. Faster. lt doesn't matter even if l die. l shouldn't have given you the lift. The bus is here. - Oh God! We are here. Meenaxi. Driver, stop the bus. Meenaxi.

''Why don't you come forward and take it yourself?'' How long will we have to wait for? Ask her to drop her clothes. - Mr. Bullabbai, we told you.. ..right in the beginning that she won't drop her clothes. You took money for dance performance.. ..but you are saying dialogues here. - She won't drop them. Don't upset the kids. Go and tell her. Suri. What's this! Why are you troubling a girl in this way! Hey, you're lecturing us in spite of being an actor? Why do you slap me, Mr. Bullabbai? Remove her clothes and send her back on to the stage. l won't remove my clothes. - Hey, why are you talking.. ..like a nun? You slept with almost everyone in this village. Didn't you sleep with me? - l slept with hundreds of men. l will sleep in future as well. Such are our lives. l'll come with you as well. But there needs to be a cover. To dance naked on streets and stages.. ..l am not an animal. l am human being. Suri. Srinu. Hey, what's wrong with you! What the heck is wrong with you! Bullabbai. You dared you raise hand on Bullabbai brothers? Come. Come to the station. Hey! - Knife. Knife. Knife. Where are the bullets in it? - There are no bullets. There are no bullets. - You went her to drop her clothes? l'm police. - So what! You are police? Does she have to remove her clothes if you're a policeman? Rascal. You didn't learn your lesson on watching him getting thrashed? You want her to remove her clothes in public? - No. Are you a policeman or are you a broker? They must be thrashed first. What! You want her to remove her clothes? Remove her clothes in public? Scoundrels. - Come on. She's also a woman. You want her to remove her clothes.. ..in front of everyone? She does it for survival, boss. She is not such type of a girl. You call yourselves men? Come on ; let's go. Someone from another village is thrashing us.. ..and you are watching the show? Rascals! You are ruining the reputation of this village. Mother Ammavaru has also closed her eyes.. ..as she couldn't see your atrocities. Rascals. Rascals. So many tears in a woman's life. May be that's the reason earth is three-fourth water. Poor Mandaram! She is not such type of a girl, boss. She does it for survival. - Srinu. Did you ever love anyone? - Love. That's the most worthless thing in the world, boss. But there was a great figure called Samrajyam, boss. From back she was Eliyana and from front she was Trisha. l wooed her a lot. ln the beginning she didn't show any interest.. ..but l am not one to give up so easily. Slowly l won her heart and convinced her for marriage. Her mother approved. Her father approved. Her brother, he's a goon, he too approved of our match. And her grandma also approved, but.. - But what? But her husband didn't approve of it, boss. Not a joke, boss. From then onwards l never chased.. ..any other woman. Women are like perfumes. We can smell them, but we can't drink them. But there is something l must tell you, boss. When l am with you l feel very happy. First l liked your bike, then l liked your style.. Your English and all.. But boss, your search.. ..for sister-in-law.. That's what l liked most in you. And you know something! l don't like anything in myself. l don't like this face. l don't like this color. At last, after it's over l don't even like this beer. You must always keep on smiling, boss. When you are upset l too become upset, boss. The breeze that came in contact with you.. ..must've touched sister-in-law somewhere. Now the same breeze would go and touch sister-in-law. When we chase girls they play hide and seek.. ..and when we hide they start chasing us. When we would go far away from them.. ..then they would understand our worth. Girl, you didn't go to bed yet? l am not feeling sleepy yet, uncle. Are you alright? Eyes can't lie, dear. The Janaki l knew was never like this. Even though you are here your heart is still there. Think about it once, dear. l think you judged him a bit too harshly. Me, my ambition, my values.. He doesn't have faith in any of them. He has aversion towards people. He doesn't care about anything except his comforts. His world is different, uncle. The world is same, dear. People have different mindsets.. ..depending on the circumstances they grew in. Time could change him, right? He won't change. - Man has to change his opinions.. ..but donkeys need not. Rajaji said so. Animals don't change, humans have to change. What if Abhinav changes for good and comes for you? Hey, get up! Get up! Hey, get up! Get up! Come, get into the jeep. Sir. Sir. l'm the one who fought in the stage show last night. You can arrest me. - Come. Come. - Get into the jeep. Sir, please.. - Ok. You stay here, Srinu. You know what is the first thing that a father does.. ..when he sees his long lost son? He hugs him tightly. l don't even feel like touching you. Did you get Janaki? - No, he didn't, sir. You got a thief. l have been scanning every moment of yours. l am worried about your safety every second. But you on the hand for a girl.. ..with such people for company.. Abhi, l thought you didn't know the value of time and money. But now l realize that you don't know the value of life. l know it, dad. Mother passed away just after.. ..she gave birth to me. l am living her life too. l know the value.. lt's very valuable. But l realized it only now.. ..after l started searching for Janaki. l know that he's a thief. But you don't know.. ..that he's also a human being. Till now l too didn't know it, dad. l knew it only because.. ..l have been with him till now. Abhi, what are you talking! Your future, your status, your education.. This is real education, dad. For 25 years my studies didn't teach me anything about life. l thought life is all about l, me, myself. But it's only now that l understood that.. ..life means sharing with people around me. ln my search for Janaki l found myself, daddy. You're scared of touching me, but l want to hug you, dad. Abhi, there's some great change in you. Your mother also used to talk in the same way. Sensibly. Ok, go ahead. Find your own way. Thanks, dad. - So this is your friend. l'm GK. Nice meeting you. Gali Srinu, you know my name. Srinu, my cousin. - l'm Srinu. - Bhargav. Ok, Srinu. Take good care of my son. What did he say in English? He asked you to take good care of Abhi. Sir, l'll take good care of boss. - Great. lt's ok. - Goodbye. - Contact us if you need any help. Take care. - Bye, dad. Bye, Abhi. Come soon with Janaki. - Sure. Srinu. Start the bike, boss. - What! Boss, you're talking in my style? You liked my style and in the same way l liked your style. Come on, boss! Stop making fun of me. l'm not making fun of you. You're great, Srinu. Start the bike. - Now watch out how l ride the bike. ''Don't ask me why l was running till now.'' ''When journey become your destination..'' ''..you get back your life on its path.''

Let's stop here. - Ok, boss. Wait a minute, boss. l'll wipe it. - lt's ok. l promised your father that l will take good care of you. Two strong teas. No sugar in one tea. Make a tea in sugar. Are you wanting betel leaf? You enjoy. - Calcutta, without Kharta, R. K. Baba, 120.. ..Ratan, Pudina, cardamom.. Two betel leaves. Both for me. You get only these packets here. - Give me ten more. l'll keep them in my back pocket. Give us tea first. - But still new have to be a bit.. Hello, it's you? - Hello! - Gun-sir. Two teas. - How come you are here? We are going to Narasipatnam. lt's raining. So we stopped to drink tea. l don't think it will stop anytime soon. They are saying that there's a storm. Did they write it in newspaper? Then there won't be a storm. How come you are here, sir? - l am.. l came just here. He is Mr. Prasad. - Greetings, sir. l met them in Kurnool. - ln Kurnool he took that gun.. ..from Boyalodu and started firing and he ran away. We were really surprised when you took the gun and shot.. Brother wants to meet you. Lift them. Sister. He's brother, isn't he? Lal Salaam! - Lal Salaam! This appointment.. Sheshu, you are betraying the revolutionary movement. Who are they? - They were with Sheshu. We shot master when he tried to run away. They are not policemen. They don't have guns. Bring them here. They have got nothing to do with this, com.. You were contacting other gangs, weren't you? You are recruiting men to start a new group. Reverse recruitment. This recruitment is to make.. ..naxal groups work for public. - Then whom are we.. ..working for? For whom? lsn't it for public? People are also asking the same question, comrade. Whom did they ask? Did they ask you? You sold your head for ten lakhs and surrendered.. ..yourself to the government. Did they ask you? Stand among public. They will ask you the same question. Just by carrying a gun in the jungle.. ..you can't do any good for public, brother. You understood it only after holding a gun.. ..and wandering in the jungle for ten years? l understood it when l dropped the gun and moved in public. After six months of surrendering l saw it. There's nothing in the jungle, brother. The wild animals are out there. They are sucking helpless people's blood. Only we have the guts to stop them. Sheshu, it's betrayal of revolution. Central committee has labeled you a traitor. Death warrant had been issued on your name. Comrade, l gave up the greed of living.. ..the day l decided to fight back, comrade. l am not worried about it. We are the ones who raise questions. We are the one who stand with our heads high. Why are we here? Let us go among people, comrade. Lal Salaam! Chandranna. Stop it. - No. Stop. - You can't do this to him. Listen to me just once. Please. Why? Don't you understand what l say? What do you want to say? Sandhya, let him speak. Tell me what you want to say. l knew that naxals exist, but l didn't know how they look. But when l see you all in this way l pity you. Yes, l pity you. l too led a life like you. Away from people. ln a circle of wealth. You are also living like l did. ln this circle. He is right. What he is saying is cent percent right. You say you are a wealthy person. What do you know about people! - Yes. l'm filthy rich. l don't know about people. He who is arrogant of his wealth up to here.. ..won't know anything about people. Till a few days ago when l used to see a common man.. ..l didn't use to like it. And this.. The person who holds this is also arrogant. People are scared of him. Without guns and wealth.. ..if you move among the common people.. - Stop it. They sound good to hear.. Brother. Brother. Brother. My name is Srinu. l steal bikes and all. l like all very much, brother. Uncle Das used to say it all the times.. ..that brothers will come and solve poor men's problems. My father abandoned us, brother. When l was a kid when they dismissed me from the school.. ..l was actually waiting for you with the hope.. ..that you would come and get me back into the school. You didn't come then. And when my mother passed away.. ..l didn't even have change to perform the last rites, brother. At that time l waited for you for a long time. You didn't come even then. l have been waiting for you.. ..every time l was in trouble. But you never came, brother. And how can you come to our rescue, brother! You have your own set of problems. After such a long time he came among people.. ..to help them out and you want to kill him? No, brother. l beg you, leave him. Brother, don't kill him. Brother, don't kill him. Brother. - Police. Fire! Fast. Boss. Boss, come. - Srinu, go away. Where is it? Where is it? Boss. Come, get on the bike. Get on the bike. Srinu, go. Go. Hurry up. Hurry up. Boss, go on. Srinu. Srinu. Srinu, what happened? Hey, get up! Srinu, what happened? Get up. Srinu, get up. Call the doctor. Doctor. Srinu. - Srinu's scene is over, boss. Srinu, hang on. Nothing would happen to you. Srinu. Srinu, look at me. When one is dying one doesn't feel any pain, boss. One has only grief in the heart. - No. l have grief in the heart that l am leaving you. No. Srinu, hang on. Call the doctor. Go. Hey, nothing would happen to you. Hang on. Nothing would happen to you. l don't like anything in myself. - Don't talk like that, Srinu. But l am very happy that l am dying for you. - No, Srinu. Goddamn! Nothing would happen to you. Srinu. Srinu, nothing would happen to you. Look at me. Boss, everything's fine.. ..but l am dying without seeing sister-in-law. - Srinu, no. No. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Janaki. l saw her. l saw her. What are you saying! What are you saying! This bandage.. - You can say it later on. This bandage.. Sister-in-law tied me this bandage, boss. Hey, nothing would happen to you. Hang on, Srinu. Tell her that l am your friend. - No, Srinu. No. l need you. l need you. Hang on, man. Please. Please. No, Srinu. No, Srinu. Srinu. Srinu. Srinu! ''Which mother gave birth to you?'' ''Which village do you belong to?'' ''Which mother gave birth to you?'' Everyone makes mistakes.. ..but only a few can make sacrifices. ''Which village do you belong to?'' ''You walked along with me till now.'' ''How can Rama search Sita without Hanuman's help?'' ''Which mother gave birth to you?'' ''Which village do you belong to?'' Sir, he came for Miss. Janaki. Abhiram? Janaki left for Sileru medical camp. She must've reached the station by now. He's gone. Srinu's dead. l met him just a few days ago. l am not related to him anyway. For my life he sacrificed his life. l thought you left me because.. ..someone poisoned your mind against me. But now l can understand the difference between us. ln my search for you in these hands l saw a baby's birth. ln these particular hands l saw Srinu's.. Srinu's death. l saw so many things in this journey. Before that l really didn't know what humanity is. Humanity is faith. lt means giving. lt means sharing. lt means thinking about others. Helping out others. Hope for tomorrow. A little bit of joy. Few drops of tears. Only when one has all these things.. ..one becomes a human being. l never behaved like a human being. l am sorry, Janaki. l am sorry. l came so far to tell you just one thing, Janaki. Love loves the love that loves unconditional love. l love you. l love you, Janaki. l love you. l love you.
