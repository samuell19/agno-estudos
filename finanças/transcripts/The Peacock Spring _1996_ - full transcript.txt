[luscious orchestral music] [birds squawking] [gravel scrunching] [cases clattering] Bye Hannah, bye Helen. -Bye Hal. -Bye Suzie. -Bye Hal. -Bye Hilary. [girl speaks in a foreign language] -Goodbye Hal. -Have a lovely trip. [feet clomping] Is your sister ready? I'll find her, Mrs. Carrington. I expect Hal's saying her goodbyes. A very popular girl. So Una, this is the day. Are you feeling any better? There's something in this not straight. I still don't understand why he sent for us. How long is it since you've seen your father? Almost a year, in New York, last Easter. I'm sure there are good schools in Delhi. -But not Cerne. -Una, you mustn't be a schoolgirl snob and you're to have a governess. At my age? Oh Halcyon, there you are. Now, Miss Barlow's going with you to the airport. Oh, smashing! Goodbye Una. I think you'll find your father has a good reason for taking you away. I expect he needs me. [Mrs. Carrington] Needs you? That's why I have to go. Goodbye, Mrs. Carrington. Don't forget the maths, you have a real talent. Some people call that a secret flame, -so you must guard it. -[engine revving] [bright orchestral music] [feet clattering on the steps] [aeroplane engine roaring] You are the young ladies, daughters of Sir Edward Gwithian. Welcome, welcome to Delhi. Please, please to follow me. Dad! Well, here we are then, all taken care of? I'll see the baggage into your car sir. Many thanks. Well, don't I get a kiss? I thought you might be embarrassed, like this in public. Una, you're so prim. And what have they been doing with you? They can't have given you enough to eat. They did Edward, truly. Nevermind, Miss Lamont will soon fatten you up. So, home with Chinaberry, in the car. Good morning, Baba. But where is home? We don't even know yet. Number 40 Shiraz Road, the number one United Nations house in Delhi. And you, Sir Edward, secretary of conference for Asian economic development. Not only in India, but the whole of Asia. And you can believe every word. Tick tock, Chinaberry. Tick tock Sir Edward, sir. [hopeful music] [horn beeps] [engine rumbles] [gate squeaks] [gentle music] -Namaste. -Namaste. Thank you, Dino. [they greet each other] -There we are. -[door slams] [peacock squawking] Dad look, a peacock. Yes. [piano music] -Who's playing? -Come and see. -[water splashing] -[piano music continues] Here we are. [piano music stops] Here are my two girls, Hal and Una. Miss Lamont, your governess. Halcyon, why you are perfectly named. Oh, wow. And you now, let me look at you. Why Edward, she's just like you. Don't we shake hands? How do you do, Miss Lamar. [water pouring] I remember the smell of things, the smell of India. You were only three when I sent you home, after ... -After mother died. -Yes. Well, mine ran off to America, poor old dads. I say this is chicken curry, super! But you see her sometimes? Louise, no not much. Only when she's in London. Wasn't there something called pish-pash? Hm. They give it to children in India, fancy you remembering that. A baby brew of chicken with rice. I used to have to eat it or you wouldn't, you little wretch. You don't know the trouble I had bringing up these girls. Now, let me introduce Dean Mohamod, our butler, whom everyone calls Dino. And under him, we have Kareem and Aziz. Isn't this all rather sumptuous for us. There must be servants, your father does so much entertaining. The United Nations took the house over from an American oil company. I think it's a touch extravagant for our show, Una's right. I tried to cut down on things, but still we have this galaxy of servants. You can afford it. That's not the question. I think the house should be worthy of you. Oh, a Chinaberry point of view. This, all the veranda will be our school room. My room is there and through here is Una's. Hal, this is yours. Alix has spent a long time getting things ready for you. How dainty. You must've taken a great deal of trouble, thank you. And look! Una, I've got a mandolin. Can you teach me how to play it, Miss Lamont? Yes, I can. Now, see what you've got. Where? Oh, Edward! Ivory and sandalwood. Oh, I remember the smell of it. Edward, they're exquisite. [Edward] Mogul, that's what I brought you out for. What? [Edward] To play chess with me. Of course. And does Miss Lamont play chess? So that's the trouble? You silly little mutton head. I bought it to play with you. [piano music] [stick tapping] A monkey man! [tense music] [people cheering and applauding] [monkey squealing] [stick tapping] [people shouting] [car door slamming] [people singing and talking] What's this? Turn that fellow out at once! [cheering stops] [Edward speaks in a foreign language] Ram Chand, Dino, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. -Come here. -[melancholy music] I will not put up with this sort of thing again, do you understand? [gentle music] [creatures chirruping and squawking] [bottles clinking] This is ridiculous. This light, you will ruin your eyes. I like soft light. You don't understand, dude, to write poetry surroundings must be poetical. [he sighs] And you are a dolt. And you will go blind. [he laughs] Hem gives his great medical opinion. You are student only. [insects chirruping] [breath blowing the candle] [Alix plays the piano and sings in a foreign language] I heard her first like this, at a party where she was engaged to sing. As a professional? You mean she was paid? Isn't she supposed to be a governess? Not supposed, she is. Yes, but how did you know- Oh, be quiet Una or go to bed. [piano and singing continues] [creatures squawking and chirruping] Una, are you asleep? I'm sorry. The fact is, I've been wondering how to break this news to you. I heard today, I'm leaving for Japan tomorrow. How long? Conference opens next week, just a couple of days. So you can spend the time getting to know Miss Lamont. She likes you very much, she wants you to call her Alix. Thank you. Now, go to sleep. -Edward? -Hm? Who lives in the little hut, at the end of the garden? Is there a little hut? I'm afraid I don't know. Sleep tight now. [gentle music] [creatures squawking and chirruping] [curtains clattering] Hello Una! Toast and bananas now? Alix says we'll need them, and a proper breakfast after. We're going riding. -Does she ride too? -Since she was four, her father was in the Lancers. [horse whinnying] Edward will be so sorry to have missed this moment. What moment? When you are introduced to your own horses, look. [Hal] You mean we have our own horses? This is Una's, she's called Mouse. She's a little meddlesome, but Edward thought you could manage her. And this is snowball for Hal. Don't you like them? Like them? Of course we like them, it's just such a surprise. But you've ridden before? Yes, at school, but the horses didn't belong to us. -Is that yours? -No, this is Edward's. Maxim. Edward's? You mean Edward has a horse? He never takes any exercise. Why shouldn't he take exercise like everyone else? But a horse for Edward? I'm sorry, Miss Lamont, it's just, you don't know Edward, as we know Edward. Perhaps it hasn't struck you that Edward might've come to enjoy something different. -[gentle music] -[horses whinnying] [horse neighs] Isn't it Alix? Miss Alix Lamont. Good morning, Captain Singh. New post, new people. Sir Edward Gwithian has engaged me as companion to his daughters. You have come up in the world. I myself have come down as I well know, but aren't I reputable enough to be introduced? You are not reputable at all. Girls, this is captain Vikram Singh of the president's bodyguard. -Una Gwithian. -How do you do. And her sister, Hal. [horse neighing] Her reigns like hands, stop pulling Hal. And you know you should use a whip when Mouse fidgets like that. I better take myself off and beat some of the devil out of this animal. And then if I may, I shall come and ride with you, come on. [hooves clip-clopping] Gosh, at least I didn't come off. You don't have to bother about Vikram. And girls, please don't encourage him. What did he mean when he said he'd come down in the world? His father is Prahtap Singh, Maharajah of Paralumpur. I didn't think there were maharajahs anymore. No, poor Paralumpur, with independence, they've lost their lands as well. Vikram's coming back. Would you mind if I let Maxim out? He needs a gallop too. [horse galloping] I'd forgotten how stunning she is. What a thousand shames she should've spent all those years with the fat slob, Sergi. -Sergi? -Jamalal Sergi. [horse whinnies] Miss Lamont didn't get any riding with him, whatever else she did. Did you know Miss Lamont well? In Delhi, everyone knows everyone. You mean everyone who is anyone? Let's say I knew of Miss Lamont. Do you play polo, Captain Singh? Couldn't you call me Vik? As matter of fact, I would be playing polo this afternoon. Why don't you come over and meet my sister? [lively music] [they shout and clap] I see Edward's children are here today. I should have thought Edward would have brought a governess out from England. [Mrs. Porter] Who is this woman? She calls herself Miss Lamont. She was with Syed Chimanlau, you know the malwadi millionaire? Who's that, the Indian lady behind us? Lady Srinevasan, with Mrs. Porter from the American embassy. Two old busybodies. [people applauding] [lively music] [hooves clattering] Oh, well played! Sushila, doesn't Vik look wonderful? I should have been a boy and he a girl, he's so very pretty. But you are too. Didn't that hurt to put that ring in your nose? I was three months old, so I don't remember. It's nice, we haven't even had our ears pierced. Can we, Miss Lamont, Alix? English girls of your class don't have their ears pierced. Of course they do. Let's have ours done tomorrow. [lively music] Well I think we both look super. Mine didn't really hurt at all. Yes, but what will Edward say? I don't think he'll care, as long as we're enjoying ourselves. [people talking] Chinaberry, look. Thank you. Miss Ali, Miss Ali! Get in the car, come on Una, get in the car. Miss Lamont, wait for me, wait! Ah, look at these young ladies. You know me, Lobo, friend of mama! Hello, hello Chinaberry, go on! Miss Ali, wait, wait! I'll get you ice cream soda, okay, wait, wait! -[she shouts] -Okay, Miss Sahib. -We go, we go! -[engine purrs] Oh, Miss Ali. Who was that? Some drunken tramp. But he knew your name, Miss Ali. That's, that's a Muslim greeting: Mizali. [Una laughs] [creatures squawking and chirruping] [gentle music] I must order half a dozen more whiskey. And you may take this to Christopher for the trifle, but I want the bottle back. [Dino speaks in a foreign language] Thank you, Dino. We have enough sibahs until Sahib returns. I serve. Dino and Christopher have been at Shiraz Road for years. They know far more about this house than I do. Do you keep everything locked? Always in India; your servants wouldn't respect you else. [creatures squawking and chirruping] Missibaba, flowers. Mm, they're lovely Dino. -Dino? -Yes, Missibaba? -What's the sweeper's name? -Him, Maju. And the man who washes the dishes? Masalshi, he's from Kashmiri in Subhan. And the old gardener is Ganesh? [Dino] Yes, Missibaba. So, what's the other gardener's name? The chotum ali, him is Ravi. -Ravi? -Yes, it means the sun. [gentle music] [water splashing] That girl is spying on me. Nonsense talk. Why should she spy? She's a girl, do girls not like me? [Hem] Hardly a daughter of Sir Gwithian. I tell you she does. What does like you or does spy? If she spies, she must like me. I shall have to leave. That would be madness. What could be more ideal for you than this? No one would dream of looking for you here. Right under their noses, but all that's blown over long ago. Or has it? I remind you again that Anjit and Prisaad are still in prison. You have not been chained, you've never had the warder steal your food when you were desperate with hunger. Ravi bayay, you cannot be sure. In any case, a little girl cannot harm you. Stay here and write your poems. It is a unique opportunity. Hem, you are always so pompous. And you are always silly. Think what Dr. Professor Asutoth said, when you won the English prize. [he speaks in a foreign language] -The mantle of Tagore. -Bull shit. [creatures squawking and chirruping] Studying. You've found a nice place. Lady Srinivasan has telephoned; she wants to give a little luncheon party for you and Hal. I don't want to go. Una, you must, she's our minister's wife. I'm trying to do some work, it's important to me. If I'm to get to university ... Never mind all that now, we can start tomorrow. Look, I don't want to go to Lady Srinivasan's. I saw her at the polo match. You said she was a busybody. Oh, that was nothing. She's a friend of Edward's and he'll be furious if you've turned down a personal invitation. The Paralumpurs are invited too, and you like Sushila. Please. Very well. Hal will enjoy it anyway. [Alix] Why do you say that? You must've noticed, she's in love with Vik. -[people chattering] -Excuse me. [they laugh] Are you enjoying life in Delhi? You have a home, I think in England. Well, the house is Edward's but our great aunt Frederica lives in it, in Gwithian in Cornwall. Of course, you are the Gwithians of Gwithian. It's not very grand, Gwithian's only a village and a bit spoiled now with caravans and chalets. We would spend holidays there sometimes, or we used to when we were at Cerne. And do you like your new governess? Yes, thank you. I understand she was at the Sorbonne for a short while, that ought to be all right. The Sorbonne, my goodness. You girls nowadays are far too clever. [Una] Do not. Yet, Edward told me you were hoping for Oxford. Well, not now. Well, you must come and see me again. Perhaps to one of my poetry evenings? Amina Srinevasan runs quite a salon, but she doesn't ask dancers like me. My name is Bulbul, Bulbul Misra, and my husband is called Som. Hello. When you're tired of the Paralumpurs, come and see us. [Una] We have been seeing rather a lot of them. Oh, I know the attraction there, look at him now, playing around with Seragio, Bumi. -Vikram, Vikram! -Oh, Bulbul [he laughs] [Bulbul] Haven't seen you for a long time. [people chattering] Una, forgive me, I've been waiting for the chance of a quiet word with you. My, how you've grown just like your mother. My dear Kate. Did you know my mother? Kate and I were at college together, I knew you as a mere babe. Tell me, are you happy here in Delhi? I am, in waves. If there should be anything you find too difficult, please come to me. Just call the American embassy and ask for Mrs. Porter. [Alix speaks in a foreign language] [Edward speaks in a foreign language] -Edward! -Edward! Why didn't you let us know? Why didn't you tell us? I wanted to take you by surprise. Or see how we were doing? -[melancholy music] -No. But you must have some dinner. I had it on the flight. Come along, Hal, Edward's tired. You and I had better go to bed. You trusted me with them. We must be patient. When you're so close. [gentle music] [toothbrush brushing] Una, we didn't ask Edward about orders for Alix. -We can't ask him now. -Why not? [she spits] He's tired. Hal, come back. Hal. I bet she's telling him all about us. I hope she's tactful about Vikram. [tense music] I don't think we were meant to see that. That was why, I knew that was why. What? He sent for us, so he could have her. All the same, I think we should keep Alix, at least she's fun. Men need love women, Sushila says her father's got dozens. Hal, you don't know what you're saying. Una, you're so innocent. Suppose we had some prissy old governess, like Crackers at Cerne. Don't! Oh God, how am I ever going to learn? Go on, Alix. I'm waiting for Una to sit down. [flies buzzing] [Una sighs] If we had stayed at Cerne, I should have sat my additional mathematics at the end of this year. Here in two weeks, we haven't done one hour of maths. Indeed we have. Decimals, fractions, percentages. I did those when I was nine; I need mathematics, Alix, pure and applied. Very well, show me the books you were using at Cerne. I was using this. Very well, take this down. An inclined plane is such ... We haven't done inclined planes. I need to be taught! Then take it to the summer house and try! -Then if you can't- -If I can't, you can't show me, can you? -Una! -Teach? You couldn't teach a junior. I don't believe you've ever taught. You never went to the Sorbonne. You, you're a governess sham! Una, how can you? Go to your room! I should prefer it. And you must stay there until I tell you to come out! [door slams] [tense music] Una, Alix cried. I'm glad. She's tried so hard. Everything's so happy and easy. -Is it? -Yes. Why can't you be? Why do you always have to be so difficult? Because I'm honest, that's why. I wish I weren't, but I am. Is that why you called it a sham? I know they're lovers, but what's that got to do with us? Everything, don't you see? Edward wanted Alix living here with him, but he couldn't have her. Sushila says he'll get tired of her. She says they always do. I don't think Edward will. He got tired of Louise. No, she got tired of him, Edward is faithful. [she sighs] He said he needed me to talk to, he needed us. Now he wants us to go to bed at eight so he can be alone with her. He said he and I would play chess. We'd never once ... -Not ever! -[chess pieces crashing] [creatures squawking and chirruping] Una, please wake. What is it, what? I had to come to beg you. Beg me? Beg you not to tell. It's true, I can't teach you, I didn't go to the Sorbonne. If you tell Edward, he'll send me away. -He won't. -He will. And you've had his love from the day you were born. You've never had to build your life on lies. You have no idea what it is to be poor in India, to be a nobody. And so I beg you. Have a little patience. I'll talk Edward round, explain, perhaps I can persuade him to let you go to the American International School, but let me do it in my own time, in my own way. Please, Una. [she sighs] All right, I won't tell. Now get dressed, time for dinner. -[tense music] -[door clatters] [creatures squawking and chirruping] [Una mutters to herself] [Ravi] Just to tell you that I am I, and please do not be frightened. -Ravi. -You know my name? I asked Dino. I-I've been watching you. I know you have, Miss Spy. Very well, I watched you too. That's why you put the feather as a marker? In England, we'd say a peacock's feather brings bad luck. Here, the peacock is sacred, the very emblem of India. I hope the book was properly cleaned. The earth was wetting you through very hard, [he speaks in a foreign language] That Miss Lamont is not good for you, I think. I knew you were there, but I didn't think you'd understand English. No, Ravi the choda mali shouldn't speak English. Perhaps I am master spy? Should I ask Miss Baba, may I sit down? Don't be silly. I have spoken English since I was little. Had I stayed at St. Thomas's College, I should have gained a first, probably with honours. [Una] And you didn't stay. No, I was persuaded into a group the authorities do not like. Had I gained a first, my father would have wanted I come home and manage our estate. My mother, I should become a doctor. My uncle would have wanted me in government service, diplomatic. But you see, I did not want any of these things. I wanted the writing of poems. -Are they good poems? -Very good. I wanted peace to write them. And it's peaceful in your father's garden. Did someone throw the book? -Erm, I'm sorry. -No, you were brave. Unfortunately, I have forgotten most of my mathematics, but I am arranging for you. I have a friend, Hemungu Sherma, at present in medical school, but he is very good at mathematics. He will cycle to you one, two times a week when no one is about and slip in here with me. Then we shall come in here and teach you. You'll be seen. Him and I have the art of disappearing. But suppose he doesn't want to. What I want, Hem wants, he will come. Zero equals five minus five times square root 3T. Ssh. [creatures squawking and chirruping] Ram Chand, Ram Chand! So, T equals one over square root three seconds, the time taken to reach the highest point? Yes, good. And then the downward journey would take the same time. So the total flight time is? Two over square root three seconds. And that's the answer! And now, now you know how long the flight is, you can easily find the distance or the range along the slope. Miss Gwithian, you are not listening I think. -Yes I am, I am. -Let me look. You're not properly dressed. I am not? No, you have no flower behind your ear. [gentle music] You're late. Have you been working in the summer house? And I think I've found the answer to that problem. Quite right. I must say Una, it does you credit. Perhaps I can go on by myself, for a little? [flies buzzing] When I was a little boy, I used to eat ants because somebody told me they would make me wise. And did they? Hem, he says not. Tell me about your home. The women and children live in the courtyard below. My father sits in the evenings, looking out over his lands. The land is flat, you can see for miles. In his father's time, it was more, much more. At his death, it should be divided among his sons. But my father's land will not be divided as I am only son. So it will all be yours? Yes and more, my uncle has no children. But I don't want it. I want to live in the world. Now, Hem will be cross with us, back to your mortice, Miss. [upbeat dance music] [people talking and laughing] In my father's time, there would be 100 guests, maybe more; this ballroom would be crowded and there'd be a military band in the garden, not this, this thing of Vikram's. It's a record player. Quite a noise, gone! [upbeat dance music] -[people talking] -[glasses chinking] Alix, Alix. Come and dance. You can't want to spend your whole night talking to children and old people. The Maharani Sahib is not old, and Una and Hal happen to be in my charge. Well, you can forget them for 10 minutes. I should tell Sir Edward that you are pestering me. But if I tell Sir Edward there was a time when you were pleased to be so pestered. Vikram go away, please go away. -But what if I got can't? -Vikram, please. Alix, shall we go home? What are you doing here? Must you cling to me like a limpet? Go and dance with the others. Yes, run along. [gentle dance music] [creatures squawking and chirruping] [knuckles rapping on the door] -Good night, Alix. -Good night. It must be difficult to be so desirable. You think you know something, don't you Una? Yes, I think I do. As it happens, you don't. At the Paralumpurs, I had a message from my mother that she was ill and I had to go to her. Your mother is here, in Delhi? [Alix] Yes, in a home. Why haven't you taken us to see her? She likes to be quiet. Besides, there are some things I prefer to keep to myself. Before you go, and I should like you to go, I think you should beg my pardon. I can't. [door slams] Ravi? One day, will you read me your poems? If you will come to my hut, tonight. Tonight? The garden house is too lazy. For mathematics well and good, they are clear precise. -If we did them. -We will do them. Come tonight. See, even the book is Indian. So many of my friends are writing poems of Dylan Thomas, E. E. Cummings, all your poets. These poems are of nobody but myself. I haven't shown them to anyone, not even Hem. They are Indian poems, the others are not true, listen ... Let me read them. But will you know them so quickly? I shall know them. I wrote them in India, in English. I hope they are plain. [gentle Indian music] "Here, where I come at evening in this great city's cage, I find an empty page. There, in my homeland it is cow dust time. Ah, the warm dust under my small bare feet. Who saw the hoopoe fly on the first day of spring, who saw his sudden wing? I, how can I bring to you words that will sing to you? Lord of the absolute, Krishna with your magic flute, call and I shall write far into the night. For who saw the hoopoe fly? I, a poet." I'm sorry, was my reading very bad? Did you mind? Mind? I am ulu, I didn't know it could sound like that. Nor did I. But did you like it, like it? I think Ravi, you have real talent. Talent is a sacred flame and you must guard that. -[mallet whacks the ball] -Oh, excellent. -Oh. -Well played, partner. Excellent, Miss Hal. Lady Srinevasan, do you know a poet called Ravi Battacharya? Ravi Battacharya? I think he must've been at St. Thomas's College. Ravi Battacharya, he was a St. Thomas student, one of the few worthwhile ones. How did you come across him? I-I read some of his poems. Oh, I didn't know they'd been published. They weren't, I found them in a St. Thomas's college book. [people shouting] [mallet whacks the ball] Ravi Battacharya ought to have tried for the Tagore Prize. What is that? Well, it's awarded every year in memory of Rabindranath Tagore by the Institute of Fine Arts of which I am president. It carries with it a grant of 5,000 rupees, which makes it our most important poetry award. And do you think Ravi, this young poet, might have won it? And still could, but then who knows what's become of him. I couldn't have won the Tagore Prize. Why not? Because I didn't go in for it, I don't want prizes. But you want to be published? I shall be in time. Don't be meddlesome, and we'll get me a secretary next, -read the poem. -I'll be your secretary. Miss Gwithian, you ought not to be here. Won't you call me Una? Afternoon in the summer house was different. Altogether, this is not a suitable friendship. On the contrary, it suits us both. Do you always lay down the rule for Ravi? No friendship is suitable, if it has to be hidden. What does Hem do? I told you he's in medical school. [Una] Isn't he rather old for that? He is very old, two years my senior at college. He's also more than clever, he took a first. Please do stop speaking about me as if I were mere flies on the wall. Hemungu Sherma is Dr. Bappletosh's blue-eyed boy. Oh, and how can an Indian be a blue-eyed boy, huh? Aargh, take your hands off! -[he laughs] Submit, huh. -Aargh! Hush, you'll have a watchman here. And why all these questions, Miss? What is Hem to you? It's you he cares about, more than you care for ... You're Ravi's best friend. There is nothing best about me. But there is, I think there is. Alix said you want to see me. Yes, I was hoping you could tell me. This is from your mother's lawyers. Someone seems to have told her you've been leading a fast life in Delhi. People have said you've become infatuated with some young Raja. That's ridiculous. [Alix] Well, of course it is. [Una] And anyhow, he isn't a Raja. So you know all about this too? Perhaps you could advise us who informed Louise? That's easy, I did. I thought she ought to know, after all she is my mother. And what exactly did you think she ought to know? That I'm in love with Vik, head-over-heels. Vik? She means Vikram Paralumpur, Edward, I promise you, this is all ridiculous nonsense. -No, it's not! -Quiet Hal. Of course the girls have been out riding with young Paralumpur but always with me. You know they've been to a dance- Well, the result is just the same. Louise is questioning my custody, Hal will have to go. Go where? I suppose, to England, to your aunt Frederica. I shan't, I'm going to marry Vikram! Oh, for heaven's sake child! Unless you're so horribly mean, you won't give me a dowry. [Hal crying] My God, I should never have brought her out here. The girl's quite off her head. The girl's very young, I'd better go to her. But, the scandal would only be worse if you sent her to England. The convent school in Darjeeling Sushila goes to would be quite far enough. So, did you know about all this? All what? You've bought her a ring. What? Oh, you mean Alix? Yes, it's a brown diamond. And do you know all about her? About Charmin Lalsetji for instance? Una, I've just had one display of childish ignorance, please spare me another. There's one thing about Alix you may not be aware of. That horse you ride every day, I bought for her. -Mouse belongs to Alix? -Yes. We couldn't find a suitable horse for you, so Alix insisted Mouse should be yours. That's typical of her, so selfless. Una, I want to talk to you. Will they send you away too? I don't think so. They can't pack us both off to Darjeeling. They still need an excuse for Alix living here. -So I'm still gooseberry. -Gooseberry? What is gooseberry? Having to be where you're not wanted. Nevermind, I have made a big decision, 'cause you told me. What? To try for the Tagore Prize. But Hem said we'd have to talk to Edward. We shall, listen. I should tell you how it will be. You and Sir Edward will be in the front seats, of course, and I should announce, "I, Ravi Battacharya write in both Hindi and English, but as my pronunciation of English is not so good, I call on my friend, Miss Una Gwithian to read with me." He will be astonished. And when I win the prize, he will be filled with admiration and we shall cast ourselves at his feet. [gentle music] -All right. -Goodbye. I'll write. I want to hear everything. -[doors clattering] -Hal? -[engine roaring] -Goodbye, Hal. -Goodbye, Una. -[melancholy music] Una, I'm going riding, Mouse should be- Then you can take her, my back still aches. You're doing this to make me unhappy, aren't you? No, I'm doing it because I don't want to ride. This isn't your writing. -It isn't, is it? -No. Oh my god, what have you been doing? And what are you doing, looking at my private books? It is my business to see your work. Then why didn't you look before? That's what Edward will ask, isn't it. Did you really believe all this time I could have worked those problems out all by myself? You told me ... So wouldn't it be better now if we made a pact? A pact between you and me? That I won't monitor you if you don't monitor me. What do you mean, monitor? Split on one another. Do you think I don't know about you and Edward, Mrs. Tanson? I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am no longer Mrs. Tanson. I have my divorce. I am only waiting for the decree to be made absolute. Una, I appeal to you once, I appeal to you again, you must tell me what you have been doing. When it's time, I shall tell Edward all about it. I want it be a surprise. A surprise for Edward? But we don't want to tell him- We? I, and the person who's helping me. I-If you'd like to know, it's a friend of Lady Srinevasan's. Ah, so you met there. So, if we keep our pact, neither of us needs to worry. Una, there's something I want to say. I've tried before but I think you've been avoiding me. [creatures squawking and chirruping] What did you want to say? Just that I think you have some cause to be angry with me, but not with Alix. Also in case this matters to you, but I think I've never been happier in my life. I'm not, not angry with you. Or to be disappointed, then. I know it seems that I dragged you and Hal out to India for no good reason. But I've been too busy and preoccupied to explain. But I believe that the future of our world lies in Asia. And I wanted you both to have this chance of coming to terms with another way of life. We haven't seen much. I know, but the conference is due to have two weeks recess shortly. I thought I'd take you away. Take me away? -Now? -Just the two of us. I thought we should go up to Darjeeling and visit Hal, catch a glimpse of the snows. What will you do with Alix? Oh, Alix will be all right. Hello, here's Mr. Sen. Good morning; Una, Mr. Sen. He's in charge of our United Nations stores. What can we do for you? Sir Edward, I should like to speak to you. Of course, sit down, have a cup of coffee, Sen. Privately sir, it's a private matter. Oh, very well, sorry. [creatures squawking and chirruping] Sir Edward, it's 13 bottles of Scotch whiskey. I checked most carefully. Have you ever taken whiskey? No, never Sir Edward. Then who else do you know could have taken it? The cupboards are never left unlocked? Not by me. I give out your stores from your own cupboard. Dino takes what is needed from the other cupboard and I enter it in the ledger. But no bottles are missing from the store sir Sayed. But dozen and one bottles are gone from UN cupboard. [he sighs] There we are, thank you Dino. [door clattering] I think that's clear, Dino will have to go. [melancholy music] [knuckles rapping at the door] Come in. Oh, Ram Chand. Miss Baba. We are asking, please. All servants: Christopher, Aziz, Chinaberry. We want to go to Sir Edward and speak for Dino. To tell him what? Scotch whiskey sell in the market, 150 rupees one bottle. But Dino never take one back, she take. H-how do you know? Miss Lamont know to steal for selling. She take it to the hotel for her mother. Chinaberry know that hotel. That's not proof, Ram Chand, we have to prove it. [tense music] -Are you ready? -Coming. Thank you, Ram Chand. I'll drop you off at Bulbul's, then I must go to Connought Place to pick up the things Christopher needs for this dinner tonight. No time to waste, I must call on my mother too. At least 30 people are coming to dinner and Alziziz and Yust are taking command. Has Dino gone already? It stops talk among the servants, better done with at once. Dino's been at Shiraz Road for more than 30 years. [keys jangle] [bottles clunk] -Alix? -In the car. I have nothing ... [engine revving] And where have you been? I sent Chinaberry to fetch you more than an hour ago. Bulbul wanted to play bridge. Very well, I'm getting out of this now and you are coming too! Alix, you must tell Edward. Tell him what? About the whiskey and Dino. You must explain what you did. Tell him yourself and see if he believes you, spiteful little girl. I gave my word to you, we made a pact. I shan't talk to you here, you're coming with me. -No. -I say you will! We're going riding. [gentle music] Now, what have you got to say to me? Just that, you must tell Edward. [Alix] Tell him what? About the whiskey for your mother! Tell him everything, about your troubles and Mr. Lobo. Tell him why Charmin Lalsetji sent you away. So, you ferreted that out too? You can trust Edward, he's a loving person. If you tell him everything ... -And if I won't? -You must. Must is a word you can't use to me, but I can use to you. You must remember, you are only a spiteful little school girl and should keep your nose out of other peoples' business! I am here to teach you, and I am going to teach you a lesson, a lesson in obedience. Get on Mouse! No, I shan't. Do you understand? I am giving you an order, get on your horse! It's not my horse, it's yours! And you are going to ride her! Alix, you can't! Do as I tell you! Whip me then! [whip cracking] Oh my god, god. Hello! Anything wrong? I came off, that's all. Oh, bad luck. You sure she's all right? Shouldn't we call a doctor? No, it's fine, I'll just go and lie down a bit. It's all right, Edward, I'll see to her. Conference breaks at six and I'll come straight home, in time to get ready for them. -Una. -Leave me alone. [door slams] -Una! -Ssh! There may be people in the garden. What is it? What has happened to you? Alix, she hit me with a whip. Go back to your room, I will fetch Hem. [creatures squawking and chirruping] Hey Bhagwan, what has this bad woman done? Hold tight, I'm putting on a spray, it may hurt a bit. [spray whooshing] Do not bathe tonight, and you will be stiff tomorrow. Here. What is it? -A small sedative. -[water pouring] Well, go on. Now you must go to bed and sleep well. Thank you for coming. Small chance to refuse when Ravi plead so beautifully, you will be better soon. Goodnight, Hem. [soft Indian music] [Ravi speaks in a foreign language] Ravi, is that one of your poems? A lullaby. My ayah used to sing it to me. [Una] When you were a little boy? Not even a boy, in babyhood. [Una sobbing] Una. Not to cry, not to cry. Oh, Ravi. Careful now, I'm afraid to touch you. -If I hurt your back? -Let it hurt, oh Ravi! Ravi, it means the sun. [creatures squawking and chirruping] [gentle music] Una? [doors clatter] [engine humming] Why Cassie, you're in time for breakfast. What brings you here so early? I would've called last night, but you were hosting a big reception. It's to ask about Una. Thank you, Ram Chand. It seems she took a fall on the maidan. And went to bed early, she was shaken up a bit, that's all. Why, what have you heard? I was out riding too. I guess I got back to the stables just after Miss Lamont took Una home. -And? -Edward, there are sight seers, believed they'd seen something. Don't ask me precisely what. But it seems they thought Miss Lamont should have taken Una to the military first aid post and she refused. Then I have to ask, what did they think they'd seen? One of them claimed Miss Lamont had struck Una with a whip. And do you believe that? Una's mother and I were very close, I have to be concerned for her. And all I know of Miss Lamont- Is Delhi tittle-tattle. Edward, you know I would never say it. From others, not you. Alix is devoted to Una and I trust her completely. That is one of the very good reasons I've asked her to be my wife. I guess there's nothing more to say then. I hope you'll both be very happy. Thank you. Una, Alix and I have something to tell you. We want you to hear it from us because it will be all over Delhi very soon. Thank you, Ram Chand. Alix and I are going to be married. It's not really a surprise, is it? Well, no. [Una] After you gave her the ring. Can't you, couldn't you be just a little happy for us? I'm not unhappy, Edward. When is it to be? Six weeks today. April the 16th is the first possible date after Alix's divorce. I'm pressing hard for an early conference adjournment, so you and I can make that trip I promised you, to show you a little more of India. Perhaps there won't be time. [Edward] I'll make time. And as the United Nations chief representative, your father can perhaps arrange things. Yes, I know. I hope you'll both be very happy. Thank you. Now I must get to the office, and see if I can hustle those dreary delegates. You mustn't, just for me. I'll see you to your car. No, you stay with Una. Bye, you two. As Edward says, you are loyal Una. To Edward. Yes, if you prefer. I suppose you may think this will make a difference. It will make a difference to me. [Una] I mean, to us. Una, I want to be a good stepmother. But we made a pact, remember? That's why Edward still doesn't know how those whiskey bottles vanished from the UN stores or why you used a whip. Una, please. So, what I do from now on; where I go, whom I see is my business, do you agree? Yes, very well. Good. And this afternoon, I need Chinaberry to drive me to Lady Srinevasan's. To meet a friend, the one who was helping you with the mathematics? No, to play bridge with Bulbul. [gentle romantic music] What's this? A ceiba tree. When the flowers fall, the cotton from the pod blows everywhere. If I love you too much, I shall kiss you away. Ravi, I don't want to go away from here, not ever. [tense music] Una, what is wrong? It's tomorrow, he just came home and told me. Conference is adjourned, we leave tomorrow. We knew it had to happen, for how long? 10 days, the wedding's two weeks on Thursday. Perhaps a good thing. It will give me the best chance to finish my poems for the Tagore Prize. Finish them without me? I am the one who writes the poems. [bird squawking] Come here. Your time is short, we make the best of it. Suppose Hem comes? -Hem doesn't come now. -Why not? Who knows, who cares? -[tense music] -[stick tapping] -[hands clapping] -[monkey squealing] [Una gasping] What is it? -The monkey man. -Again? But why did it upset you so? It was only a performance, acting, like something in a play. She screamed so, when the male monkey took her, should it have hurt so much? She screamed, but he went on and on and on. That's enough. -[luscious orchestral music] -[train chugging] [gentle music] Kangchenjunga. -Worth coming? -Yes. Thank you. Most of the girls aren't really religious, well not silly about it. In fact, Sister Bernada said to me and Sushila the other morning. Are you feeling funny? [she sighs] Such a smell of cooking. Expect to see sausages. I think, I think I'll go to my room. She looks pretty grizzly. Could be the altitude, and we were up at four this morning. [water pouring] Hello. Sorry about that. Are you all right now? Erm, I wish I'd kept a diary. -I do. -That doesn't help much. I think I'm going to have a baby. A baby? Una, you can't mean it. I do. But it isn't possible. Why not? I'm the same as other girls. But you don't know anybody. No one's ever even looked at you. That's what you think. You may be surprised to know, while you were making eyes at Vikram Singh, I've had a lover. But you couldn't have. I ought to know. Holy smoke. Who is it, Una? Who could it be? Nevermind, I'm not going to tell you now. [Hem] But what you going to do? Wait, that's what all mothers have to do. Edward and Alix will probably send you back to Cerne. That will be a surprise for all of them. Aren't you afraid? Of course, but happy afraid. Will he, the man, help you? I'm sure he will. But what will happen if he doesn't, who will take care of you? Where will you go? Darling Hal, he will. [engine rumbling] [creatures squawking and chirruping] [car doors banging] Ah, when did you get back, Cara? I flew into Delhi this morning. It is like a poem. First you plant seed, and then it grows. But are you pleased? I hoped you would be. Ravi? Ought I, ought I to touch you now? Perhaps not, I don't know. Better not. I'm sorry, but I wish we really knew. I'm almost sure, but if we knew for certain. If you can stay alone for a while, I can get Hem. But will he come, you said ... He won't mind, in any case he will be studying. This is one more study, Hem will come. How dare you come to me. I am student only. Una can go to her own doctor. No, I couldn't. Then Ravi can damn well find one. Hem! Anyway, who else can I turn to? You have always helped me, always. Think how easy it is for you to have a test made in medical school. There it is an everyday affair, for us it is life and death. [piano music] [creatures squawking and chirruping] [Hem] The test is positive. [she gasps] That means yes. I say, fools. Are you knowing nothing of sensible things to do? It is our first love, this is holy thing. The woman is fire, the door is the flame, the pleasure, the spark and from the fire springs the child, that is do you punish her. And maybe, but it is also every day. And truth is neither of you gave any thought to this trouble coming. Why should there be trouble? There's only two months until the prize giving, then everyone will know openly of Una and me. -And of this? -Why not? Surely you were impossibly silly. Ravi, think of your parents. To them, this will be abysmal disgrace, and you? Do you think Sir Edward would let his daughter have a child by an Indian, a servant? Ravi's not a servant. And how could Edward stop it? -Well think. -They couldn't. -They couldn't do it. -Wake up. How could they do it? With a doctor of course, you're living in the 20th century. This could be terminated in a few minutes. Don't, you're brutal Hem. If it is brutal to speak the truth, I am brutal. Tell him. No one is going to touch my son. Then you will have to take Una away, and quick. But where? That is your affair. At this early stage, the pregnancy could be terminated up to 20, perhaps 26 weeks. After, I doubt Sir Edward would risk it. So if you want this child ... Of course we do. Then the next four months, it's your dangerous time. Then, for four months we should have to hide. She would have to hide. You can take her away somewhere, then come back and win the Tagore Prize. What to fear? Who would connect a poet genius with some dumb fool gardener's boy? -[melancholy music] -[tyres rumbling] [door slamming] Thank you very much, Chinaberry. [engine roars] Una! [gentle music] [engine chugging] Where are we? -Hem's annex, where he lives. -[door clattering] But Hem said he wouldn't help us. I haven't asked him, but I have the key, come. [door squeaks] So, this is where Hem lives? Doctor Babbaltosh lent him that, he gave him the typewriter. Doesn't Hem have anything of his own? [Ravi] What would he do with it? -How sad. -Nevermind him. We must make you now into a good Indian bride. -Where are your clothes? -[case clicks] Too clean, I dirty them a bit. Take off your clothes now, we have a lot to do. Did you bring the dye for my hair? I bought it on the way, it's in my trunk. I brought the poems as well, not safe to leave behind. Here's what we need. See! What is it? -One of Hem's horrors. -Where? Urgh. But we have to use the sink to do your hair. I'll get rid of it. Too nasty! There. Ravi, you shouldn't, think of Hem. It's done, Hem will find another one. Come on, we'll dye your hair now. Yes, I'm ready. [water running] Ravi, you said we wouldn't. I have unsaid, we can be quick. No, Hem wouldn't like it. But I like it! Not on Hem's bed. New experience for it, I bet. Ravi, no. -[people talking] -[train whistle blowing] [Ravi] Don't pick your way like that. The platform's filthy. You are supposed to be accustomed, walk, walk. [people shouting and talking] Quick, get up. [Una] But it's full up already. We shall be lost in the crowd, and some monkey heads. [people talking] Una. It's in the passageway, everyone will push past us. It's the only empty space. I will go and buy some food and water. [train chugging] [people chattering] [train whistle blowing] [wheels clattering] Ravi, I can't go in there, there's no paper. What do you expect, the tap in your hands? And I have to squat. Other women do. Wait a minute, I'll get you some newspaper. [gentle music] [people laughing and chattering] [train whistle blowing] [gentle music] We shall be going all the way to Benares, they may be checking all the trains. Not yet, Edward and Alix won't be back from the bird sanctuary. -[people chattering] -[tense music] Thank you. Ram Chand, good morning. -Namaste. -Namaste. Ah, thank you. Lady serves father and mother in the drawing room. Father? I have no father. Well, it seems you have now. Yes, here we are. We have come to wish you, what a surprise, hm. Edward, this is my mother. Ah, splendid. Goodness me. [she laughs] Come Ali, let me look at you. I'll say, but you have taken care of her and she is really Lady Gwithian. Now, this gentlemen is Mr. Lobo, I have known him a long time. So has Ali, though she does not choose to allow him. Mama. Honoured, much honoured noble sir. And you are not the only ones to get married. This afternoon, Father Gonzales is going to marry Basil and me. We are going to live in Mccluskieganj, a Eurasian settlement, if you will lend us a little money to buy a bungalow? We have come to invite you to our wedding, though you did not invite us to yours. In any case, we have come by to wish you and Basil has brought you some cakes. Come Basil, you must kiss the bride. Well, darling. Oh Eddie, Eddie I should call you. So many, many times I've forgiven Ali but why talk about unhappy things today? Much better we have a nice wedding drink, the four of us. Mama, you mustn't stay, Edward has work to do. Nonsense, ask Aziz to bring some drinks. That is my generous boy. Did you not see the ring he has given Alix? My God, what a ring. Can I forget that week-in and week-out you have sent me whiskey? Mama, you shouldn't speak of things like that. Have I sent you whiskey? Who else? And none of your cheap Indian brands, the very best Scotch, bottle after bottle. Oh yes, of course, I'd forgotten it. Excuse me Mrs. Lamont, Alix is right, I have some work to do. Please make yourselves comfortable. Alix will bring you something to drink. Such a busy man, not to worry. I'll see you this evening. Edward, Edward, you must have something to eat. Isn't there anything you can say to me? Only that I'm glad Una wasn't here. Where is she? She went to Bulbul's for the night, I expect she'll ring. Yes, of course. If you could understand? Oh but I do, my sadness, my regret is that I allowed Dino to be dismissed. I was afraid. Of losing me? Oh my dear, you could never have been more afraid than I was of losing you. Surely you knew that? [melancholy music] [train whistle blowing] [train chugging] [water dripping] Is it safe? Donated by some local rich man. [he speaks in a foreign language] means to take care. See, I am taking care of you. Isn't it rather the rich man? [train wheels clattering] [water pouring] [gentle music] Have you tried everyone? And searched her room. She seems to have taken nothing, everything's here. Only her toothbrush and a comb, they're not in the bathroom. Her notebooks, letter from Hal. [Alix] It came today. She couldn't have been abducted. And hoodwinked Chinaberry? I never played one game with her. [he sighs] Perhaps, what's this? [tense music] "I'm safe and well and happier than I've ever been. Don't try to find me. You have your new life and I have mine. Love Una." She's gone. What the hell is she playing at? And where to, an ashram? -No, I don't think so. -What? I don't think Una has gone alone. You mean there's something, someone I'm not aware of? Well then for God's sake, tell me! She talked to me about someone who was helping her with her mathematics. I didn't dare to tell you because the help she needed was too advanced for me. I know you won't forgive me. Alix, I don't want to hear another word about your motives. Just tell me now, who was this person and where did Una meet them? At Lady Srinevasan's. Now this might be a tiny too. She did ask me about someone, a young poet. He used to come here and read, but this was well before her time. His name was Ravi Battacharya. Tell us some more about him. Ah, Ravi Battacharya was an outstanding young poet, outstandingly handsome too. But I remember being surprised that she knew of him because none of his poems has ever been published as far as I know. And you're sure she didn't meet him here or at Bulbul's? Oh, Bulbul and Som aren't interested in that sort of thing. And I'm quite sure she never met him here. It must be two or more years since I last saw him, he disappeared. How, disappeared? I was told he had gone underground, being involved in some trouble with an extremist group. But I had meant to tell Una that she would meet him, he has entered for the Tagore Memorial Prize. The judging will be held at the end of June. Then he may be here in Delhi? He will be on the 30th. All the finalists must read their poems. But she knew his name? And you say that it's Ravi Battacharya? Unless, of course, you know him by some other. -[Indian music] -[engine rumbling] -Come along. -I can't. You must, come along. How far have we gone? Perhaps five miles. Couldn't we have a rest, go on when it's cooler? All right. [Ravi sighs] This is a horrible place. I know, but I can't go on yet. It will be your fault if they catch us. Why should they look for us here? There may be police all along the road. Then they'll catch us anyhow. Oh, and my feet. You must eat. I can't. Fuss, fuss, fuss. It isn't me, it's him. I forget, I still can't believe it. You will believe it, one day. [Ganesh speaks in a foreign language] Ganesh says he was given leave to go back to his village for his uncle's funeral. Byron, Day Lewis's "Poetic Image", "Form and Style in Poetry", W. P. Ker, some gardener's boy. Who is W. P. Ker? One of our greatest professors of English. Shoto-Mali is coming back? [Ganesh speaking in a foreign language] Either he was fooling Ganesh or he intended to return. [tense music] What's this? Poems. Or draughts of poems. This one is in Una's hand. [Alix] Saint Thomas's College. Yes, I remember him. I fear he had reasons for being hidden and that connection, there is something which I could never understand. The boy had a friend, perhaps two years older than him, a young man called Hemungu Sherma. Almost two years ago, there was an incident at a factory near here where a group incited the factory workers to riot. A foreman came out, simply I believe doing his duty, and he was beaten and had acid thrown in his eyes. The group got away, but one young man gave himself up and was arrested: Hem Sherma. -Well- -Please listen. Hem Sherma could never, ever have done such an act. I knew it, yet the trial court found him guilty and he was sent to prison. He refused to name the others, but I made him appeal against his own sentence and him was freed. Very well, but what is this to do with my case? Only this, if you want to find Ravi Battacharya, I suggest you go to Hem Sherma. [gentle music] [peacock squawking] [music intensifies] [Una] Ravi. What? What is it? A peacock, I saw the peacock dance. [knuckles rapping loudly on the door] [child shouting] Mr. Sherma, may I come in? No, I know why you have come. Miss Una changed here, Ravi Battacharya has a key, but Sir Edward, I do not know where they have gone and I do not want to know. But you were a party to this. I was not party. I advised them to speak to you, they would not take my advice. You mean this Ravi wouldn't? Him I might persuade, but not Miss Una. She has come to love Ravi. Come to? And this has been going on for some time? My daughter is under age. You must have known that this, this gardener was committing an offence. If to fall in love is an offence. I've told you Adam and Eve did it before the fall. [truck rumbling on the road] I do not wish to sleep at all! You've slept on the train! [fist raps on the door] [Ravi speaks in a foreign language] [gentle music] Well, nothing seems to be known against this young man Battacharya, sir. [he sighs] I understood from Professor Asutoth that he joined an extremist group. We have no proof, but er, Hemungu Sherma has a police record. He was jailed for three years. He appealed and was acquitted. So it seems. All said, it will be easier to take him in and urge him to talk. [dramatic music] You're going to sleep again. [Ravi speaking in a foreign language] Don't you know, you are a dead weight on my arm? Then don't hold me. I have to hold you, the door isn't safe. -[marching music] -[people talking] -[Una groans] -[water splashes] [Ravi shouts] Are you all ... You let go of me! I warned you. Bye, namaste. -[bell ringing] -[marching music] Come on! [they speak in a foreign language] You must get me a clean sari, I can't go to your grandmother's like this. Of course you can, I tell you she will not even see your clothes. I'm reeking. [Ravi] Your fault for jumping in the puddle. I didn't jump, I fell. Who were all those people? I told you, I don't know, some religious procession. You call that a religious procession? Yes, our religion. I thought you loved India. I do; Ravi, I've got these spots. Until your fastidious little nose is rubbed in hair, I tell you, these people will go at dawn to pray, wash in the river ritually. I think it's prickly heat. Immerse themselves, which is more than you will do you little hypocrite. What are you going? [Una] Where you said I wouldn't, in the river. Una come back, we are at my grandmother's. In the river. [Ravi] Don't be a fool. [case clatters on the ground] Bring me a clean sari. You can bathe in the house. [tense music] [gentle music] You're like a water lily. [calm music] Come, I've been to the shops and bought you a clean sari. Come, my grandmother is waiting. Mother Ganges, Ganga Maili. [water splashing] Here. [door clattering] Safe, we are safe. [creatures squawking and chirruping] Sri Battacharya. Why have you come? I have a daughter, 15 years of age. I have reason to believe that she's been abducted by your son. I have no such son. Ravi Battacharya is your son. He has committed an offence against my daughter. If he brings her here ... She would be returned to you immediately. Such a girl would not be permitted in my house. Do you understand Sri Battacharya? I have no alternative but the police, this could be a criminal charge. Your house could be searched. They may search it. He will not come back here. I have given orders. Sri Battacharya. I can do nothing to help you. It's time for me to take my meal. Good morning, Sir Edward. [people chattering] Sir Edward, I'm Ravi Battacharya's mother, how do you do? [he responds in a foreign language] Forgive me, at times one is forced to eavesdrop. Try to understand, no worst blow could have fallen on my husband; I am the mischief. I was educated in the Western way and now Ravi is tainted. By my daughter? To my husband, such a union is unthinkable and so there is no choice. Here is the address of Ravi's grandmother, to which I think they may have gone. And if I should find them there? Ravi can be persuaded, especially if his work is threatened. [people talking] [doors slamming] [people talking in a foreign language] [door clatters] Where are you going? To report back to duty, sir. In Shiraz Road? I had been on leave of absence to observe the funeral of my uncle. This is your grandmother's house? She's not at home. I think she is, you will take my card to her. She doesn't receive strangers. Now be sensible, you know I've come for Una. This is Colonel Jaiswal, the inspector general and chief of police. [door banging] [Ravi shouts] [people singing] You are sooner than I expected. If I hadn't come, would you have sent for me? I think not. Better I think to let things take their course. [people talking and singing] Where is Una? The little one is asleep. Now you have found her, what is the hurry? The hurry is that a scandal might blow up. Also I have a conference to attend on Monday morning. Speaking of scandal, there is a phrase in law, Sir Edward, the innocent party; here there is no innocent party. Either both are innocent or both are guilty. The fact is she is under age and they have run away. From what did they run? From fear of their families? Fear is an ugly thing. We make it from divisions: Indian, English, caste, class, young, old ... [she speaks in a foreign language] Ah, I thought I'd forgotten that word. With such ideas, you should guard her more closely. I thought I had. As soon as she saw the river, your little daughter went to bathe herself, before ever she came to the house. I asked her why, her answer was simple. She said, "To wash away the dirt." She said more than she knew. Why make dirt, Sir Edward? -[horn beeping] -[children shouting] [Edward] Una. Go away! My dear, I'm not cross. But I am furious. I said, "Don't try to find us." I had to, Una be reasonable. Ravi is my reason. Ravi could be charged and sent to prison, perhaps for seven years. He's still my reason. [he sighs] Well, you can't understand why just now. One day you will. No, I will never see. Ravi has. What did you say? Ravi has seen sense. He's agreed to be put under surveillance by Colonel Jaiswal, the chief of police. If he stays under that surveillance, he'll be allowed to compete for this Tagore Award, then he's going home to his father and mother. I don't believe it. And he's promised not to see you again. That's ridiculous. I don't believe it, I shall never believe it. Not if you can hear him say it? [gentle Indian music] -Ravi. -[children shouting] Ravi? Why did you send for me? Couldn't you take it from him? What? What have they done to you? Una, you don't understand. If I don't do as they say, this could send me to prison. Then you must go to prison. What of my work? Poets write in prison, think of Oscar Wilde. Wilde was not a good poet. Besides in 10 years ... -Edward said seven. -Even seven. We shall not be the same. I shall be the same. [Ravi] You think so now. Think? I know. Oh Ravi, Ravi hold me. Tell me this is a bad dream, isn't it, isn't it? The fact is Una, we have to give in. This room has a back staircase. Before you count 20, we'd be among the pilgrims. You can see them bathing now, no one would ever find us. I have 100 rupino, I hid it, if we're quick ... You're not coming. I can't. You don't want to come. That is not the question. I want to write my poems, I see now, that is paramount. Paramount? You've told me so a dozen times. That was before. It will be difficult enough to write the poems well without these police fellows over me, and I have to go home, eat humble pie to my father. Please, don't make it worse for me. I tell you, this is over. How can it be over, when our baby is coming? [he yells] Look Una, as soon as you get home, you must tell Miss Lamont, she will know what to do. All women have such ways. You said no one is going to touch my son. You said that! I was foolish. Colonel Jaiswal is kind. He and your father, they have made me see, I was foolish and bad. They made you see this was bad, and you let them? Let them? Get out of my sight, go! [she weeps] Oh. I have something to ask you. Ask my darling. Edward, please leave me here with Naniji. In Benares? I like it here. And she would have me, you've seen how well I'm looked after. We couldn't trouble her. Nothing troubles her, that's why I want to stay. You can give me a little money, a little would do. Please, Edward. I do understand. She is a wise serene person, but you're not thinking. I am, you don't need me now, you have Alix. Oh, Alix. You don't know how ashamed I am. -Of her? -Of myself. Yes, I can well understand your wanting to stay here, but this must be the end of all the harm I did by taking you away from Cerne. From Cerne? I know now that was wrong. You must go back to England. No, not to England. No more argument. Now, come and thank Srimati Roy. We'll spend the night in a hotel and fly to Delhi tomorrow. [dramatic music] No, that's enough! Sir, what to do? It's still not light enough. I told you to get out the dye. [melancholy music] [dramatic music] [traffic rumbling] [creatures squawking and chirruping] Namaste. Well, by luck we've settled it and hardly a soul is wiser. I can't thank you enough. Now, you must come in. Where is Lady Gwithian? Lady Sir high up in her room, Sir Edward. Why doesn't she come? Lady Sir is packing. Packing? What for? And it's time for me to say farewell. I was going to ask you to stay for a drink. Most kind, but I really must go. Well, thank you again. Excuse me [indistinct]. Oh, Edward. What absurdity is this? Where do you think you're going? The only place I know, to mama. The jewels are in that box. I've only taken a little money. Alix, there's nothing to be afraid of. Una's here safe and sound, we need you. Una must go to bed, I'm afraid she's exhausted. What is it? Tell me what's wrong. I opened Hal's letter. It came after you had gone, I thought perhaps that it might help us. What does she say? It's the postscript. "Sushila says, 'The nuns here would take the baby, if it's a girl.'" What do you say to that? It's true, I'm pregnant, we had a test. And it was positive? Yes. Shouldn't one be glad about a baby? I am. How long? Six or seven weeks. [he sighs] Alix, go and ring up Dr. Gottlieb. I think he can be trusted, ask him to come round straight away. Una says the test was positive. What should I call him for? You know very well what for, he can take Una to a nursing home tonight. -No. [she weeps] -Be quiet! Alix, do as I say. I can't. [Edward] You mean you refuse? Yes, Edward this is too cruel. Cruel? Yes, you have power, you are a great man, Edward, but what is the use of greatness if you are cruel? Then what am I to do? What else can I do? Wait. Then it will be too late. My mother would say to interfere in this is a sin. Your mother? How dare you speak of mother like that. For God's sake, don't give me all that mumbo jumbo. [Alix] It is not mumbo jumbo. What you feel in your heart is true. My God, I ought to know. Alix. It is difficult for you to understand because you have never been what we call bad. Nonsense. You haven't, I know. And that is what makes you so harsh. Harsh, cruel? What else have you got to call me? [Alix] Harsh with yourself, most of all, and Una is you. I thought she was, but not now. Not for a long time, and my fault I know. And now? Can't you make that good? Let me go somewhere, where I can have our child, mine now I suppose. That's impossible. [Alix] Why, why is it impossible? Oh, for heaven's sake. How can she keep this infant? A little bastard half caste! What have you made me say? Perhaps what you think. Hem was right, Hem said you'd do this. You want to destroy something that was beautiful and make it ugly. You didn't want me to watch the monkey man, because he made it hideous. That's what you've done to Ravi and me. Mr. Monkey man! That's enough! I'll go and ring Dr. Gottlieb myself. No, you can't! We shan't let him. It's all right, I won't let him. How can you stop him? I shall, I will. You haven't spoken to Dr. Gottlieb? Not yet, but I must. [he sighs] What else am I to do? Edward, come to me. [case clicks] [melancholy music] Thank you, but I shan't need it again. You will. I've lost too much time. Poppycock, I lost two years. You came to ask me about Ravi? To see you. You're the only person in Delhi I want to see again. I'm going back to England. Time to say goodbye. -I must go now. -Yes. Hem, Edward told me when that man had acid thrown in his eyes, it was Ravi who did it, wasn't it? Then why did you confess, go to prison when you'd done nothing? They came for Ravi. You did it to save him, why? Why did you do that? Oh, no I see. Dearest Hem, it was him, not me. So we were both ... I think you say in the same boat. Or in the same hot water. Ravi is the peacock. You know why it gives that awful cry? It's been so busy admiring its beautiful train and then it suddenly looks down and sees those ugly ordinary feet. Una, don't; Ravi is Ravi. Yes, [she sighs] I suppose anyone can have a baby. Very few can write a poem. [she gasps] Oh no. So, no one's going to get their way.
