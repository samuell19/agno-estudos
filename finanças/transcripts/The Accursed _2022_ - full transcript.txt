- [ominous music playing] - [thunder crashing] [thunder rumbling] And don't come inside until the screaming starts. [door creaking] [door slams] [fire crackling] [beads rattling] [thunder crashes] [shutter clicks, camera whirs] Sit. Commune... or curse? Curse. [clears throat] Payment first. Blood now. And... what fate... for the owner of this blood? I want the devil himself to take possession of her, for both to be locked in hell together, forever. [woman chuckles harshly] Well... the devil himself never takes possession. He sends one of his legions. A demon? Mm-hmm. And it will be whenever he so chooses, unless... [chuckles] What? It'll cost double. I'll get it, tonight. As soon as we finish, go to this person quickly. She may be violently ill and have supernatural strength. You must take this knife and wait for the point of no return, when the demon has come too far. How do I know when that is? You'll see the demon's three fingers emerging from the mouth of the accursed. Carve a crucifix into the flesh of the throat, above the chest. Are you ready to gaze into hell? Yes. Mm. Come and gaze at his blaze of fire, where winged embers rise to kindling choir! He is darkness. He is whispers. He is sweet inside your heart. He is heat. He is smoke... [gasping] ...in your throat. [thunder crashing] What now? We wait for the devil to relight his candle. Watch close my face, for the face of the accursed will soon take mine but for a moment. He... is real. He... is imagined. He... is stationed at the seal. Ahh... [fly buzzing] I... I hear... a fly. [buzzing continues] But I... I don't... I don't see one. [gasping] [clattering noise] Do... do you hear it? [noise growing louder] Only... the accursed... hears the fly! [gasping, shrieking] Where... did you get... the blood?! Where did you get this blood?! My daughter bled you while you slept, witch! My name is Mary Lynn Crandon, and this is for my husband Thomas! [shrieking] [witch snarling] [Mary] Sadie! [snarling] [groaning] [shrieking] [thunder crashing] Next time we burn it down. [thunder crashing] [intense symphonic music playing] [music fades] [birds singing] Elly, you need me to stay? No, you go. I'm fine. Fine. Let's go with that. So, are you going to stay in town awhile? Uh... probably until I sell this place. I want to get back to Haiti, they need volunteers. Lots of junk to clear out, keep me busy till then. [laughs] True. I can stop by tomorrow, help you out. You don't have to do that. I want to. I can bring wine, like old times. Great. Sounds good. Hey, Beth? Thank you for coming to the service. It means a lot. See you tomorrow, El.

[Beth] Hello. Hey, are you on your way now? Um, are you in 1952? Why am I always having to find a land line number to call you on? Like, there is such a thing as cell phones. I'm sorry, I'm always losing it. I've been cleaning nonstop. Okay, well, since you don't have a cell phone, have you seen your television set, or is that too much for you, too? No. [laughs] Why? Oh, shit. The news, like, it's pretty rotten. What's going on? They're cutting off all foreign aid to Haiti. I mean, no one is going in or out, nobody. Oh, shit. Sorry. [sighs] So, I called my team leader. He said the State Department issued a level 4 travel advisory. Level 4, that's bad, right? Right. It means I can't get a flight back. I mean, the worst part is those people still need help, and we're just abandoning them. People need help here, too, Elly. We're having a blood drive at St. Luke's tomorrow. You could start with that. Yeah, sign me up. Really? Now, that is the Elly I know. How about we do just one more of these big boxes and then pop open the Vin de Luxe, - since this is boring. - Okay. Yes! [woman] Elly. Mrs. Dudley, hi. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. It's nice of you to stop by. I only came by to give you back the spare key. I... I'm sorry I wasn't able to make the service. It's really all right, don't worry about it. Looks like you're busy. Yeah, we are. [sighs] [ominous music playing] I was the one who found your mother. Mrs. Dudley, do you want to come inside? I wouldn't have gone inside if I hadn't heard the music. Hey, El, where are the boxes from the attic? Uh, check the kitchen. I'm sorry... what music? That old song she liked to play, you know the one. I was passing by on my way to church when I heard it. It was a record. It should have been skipping, but... It just... ♪ And I'll never leave... ♪ I just... [sighing] Mrs. Dudley, I'm so sorry. You were always a really great neighbor to us, especially after my dad left. Do you mean when he ran off with that whore? Why did you run off on her, too, Elly? She was sick. She had nobody. If you had been here, I wouldn't have had to go through that horror. I'm sorry for what you saw, but you have no right to lecture me about my choices. Hey! Okay... I think you'd better go now, Mrs. Dudley. I haven't slept for days! I lie in bed at night. I keep seeing her face! [Elly] I can't believe she slapped me. No one would believe that she slapped you. She's right. About what? Maybe I should have been here. Elly, you were here. You stuck around. [Elly] Yeah, until I didn't. I hated my dad after he left her. Then I did the same thing. Well, now, your dad walked out on his wife and his daughter. That is not at all the same thing. All you did was go out of this town and went and lived your life. That's normal, that is healthy. That is nothing to feel guilty about. [phone chimes] Shoot, that's my ride. Should I cancel? No. No, you've got an early start. But I am gonna see you at the blood drive tomorrow, right? - Yes, I'll be there. - Like seriously. You're gonna show up, gonna be there? - I'm really gonna be there. - Okay. You're not your dad and you're not your mom either. Okay? You're you, and you're a good person. Remember that? [telephone ringing] Gamble residence, Elly speaking. [woman] You must be the nurse. Who's this? My name is Alma Whitelorn. I'm calling on behalf of Ms. Ambrose. She needs a carer. Your mother recommended you. My mother? When? Last week. We spoke on the telephone. I'm sorry... There must be a mistake. I've been away. I only came home a couple of days ago. Your mother said you'd be coming home next week and to try you then. Is this a bad time? [intense gurgling, whirring, clicking] Do you think she had it all planned out? Um, I don't know. Maybe. Ooh. What happened here? Oh, um... Not long after my dad left, I woke up in the middle of the night and... my mom was sitting there with a syringe and a little glass vial and... she took my blood. Were you sick? I don't think so. That's fucked up. Maybe it's why I became a nurse. Speaking of you and your nursing, you gonna take that job? I don't know. I could use the money. The aid program was helping me to pay off my nursing school. I'm been kind of in danger of defaulting. What about the sale of your mom's house? Turns out she was in some serious debt. Okay, well, for once, I cannot judge your mother, because we both know that I know about debt. [laughs] But I do think you should take that job. The change of scenery would do you a lot of good. Yeah. But it's out in the sticks and I don't have a car. Okay, well, as per my last email, I have a car. It's a piece of shit, but it's a car. I'll drive, you get the gas. You think she did it to punish me? Like trap me? [Beth] You're not trapped. You're gonna sell that musty old house and... live your life. The phone call was so weird. I don't even know how my mom knew these people or... why she recommended me. [mother, voice echoing] There, all done. [intense soundtrack] Shhh! Go back to sleep, Eleanor. [intense soundtrack] [rattling] [ominous music playing] [sighs] [intense soundtrack playing] [soundtrack subsides] [water stops] [mother] Eleanor! Get in here! Mother? Where were you? I told you, I... Where... were... you? I was volunteering... [ominous soundtrack rising] [door creaking] Look at me! [liquid pouring] [sniffing] Do you smell that? I pissed myself. And nobody came to help. Stop! You should have seen that nosy old bitch, Mrs. Dudley. "Help! Somebody, come!" She just opened up her big stupid mouth and... [roaring] [horns blaring] [train wheels clacking] [distant train passing] Elly, come on. It's that crazy neighbor lady, she just smacked this idea into your head. No, it was real. [distant train horn blowing] I mean, it felt real. Well, maybe you should... you know. What? See someone? Talk about it, professionally. Like a psychiatrist? Yeah, like a... exactly like a psychiatrist. Great, then I'll officially turn into her. That's not possible, you're never gonna become your mother. I'm just... You're grieving, and this isn't my line. I don't know what to do with this stuff, but... you can stay with me for as long as it takes. [phonograph spinning, record drops] ♪ You're my ♪ ♪ Baby girl ♪ ♪ And I'll always ♪ ♪ Love you ♪ ♪ You... ♪ Isn't that the record your mom used to always play? She always said it was our song. It was playing when Mrs. Dudley found her. Then throw it in a box or against the wall. I don't think I can do that. But I've decided I'm going to take the job, if you'll still drive me. Hey, hey, I am so down to do anything that involves us getting the fuck out of here. - Okay. - Okay. [ominous symphonic music playing] What? Weirdly familiar. [echoing] Take my hand. Girl, are you, like, 100% sure you still wanna do this? This is really in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, I'll be fine. Creepy. Was she always standing right there? Must be Alma. Yay. Alma. Miss Campbell. Hmm. I'm Alma Whitelorn. In charge of the Ambrose estate. We spoke on the telephone. You're late. Oh, yeah, sorry. The drive just took a bit longer than we expected. This is my friend Beth. Hi. The job's for one person. Oh, I'm just... I'm just the driver. We're a little behind. If you'll follow me. [softly] Wow. Refrigerator, oven. There's no dishwasher and no microwave. I'm sure you can make do. Yeah, no problem. Help yourself to some fruit. You can use the fireplace. The nights have been growing cold here. A reliable land line. You have my phone number in case of an emergency. I'll introduce you to your patient now. Don't mind if I do. I made arrangements for Ms. Ambrose to have the best possible care, but they couldn't provide her with a private room until Monday. A bed in a ward simply wouldn't do. Ms. Ambrose is a private woman. Does she have any family? A daughter. But she went away some time ago. Where did she go? Your job is Ms. Ambrose. [monitor beeping] A precaution, on the off chance Ms. Ambrose were to become responsive, but that won't happen. However, I must stress that you do not leave these grounds until the ambulance arrives on Monday, and I won't tolerate any alcohol on the premises or any visitors. Ms. Ambrose is a private... Private woman? Yeah. I'll show you to your room now. [intense soundtrack plays] Perfect. I wanted to ask you about your time volunteering. Yeah, of course. Perhaps I misread the dates on your résumé, but it seems you were caring for your mother at the same time, correct? Yeah, um... My experience was better suited to volunteering... It's not easy caring for family, is it? No, it's not. So, is this the daughter's room? There are no other bedrooms. I really must get going. If you have any further questions, I'll see you inside. [whistles softly] She is a real charmer. [whispering] Beth, can you just not say anything else? Have you met me? Okay, fine, no problem. I'll go get some air. I can't breathe in here, anyway. Oh, yeah, and I would take the couch if I were you. Why? What if the daughter comes back and finds Goldilocks in her bed? How is the apple? Mm. Biblical. [whispering] She's crazy. You're fuckin' crazy for staying. Well, she's not gonna stay with me. [Beth] Okay, there she is again. Hello. Half up front as agreed. The rest on Monday. Thank you. And you'll be leaving soon? Yep. Right after you do. Um, Alma. Do you know how my mother knew Ms. Ambrose? I believe they were old acquaintances, no? Uh... maybe. I'm not really sure. Well, if that's all, I'll say good afternoon then. Thanks for everything. Yeah, I rest my case. [contemplative music playing] All right, get it all out. Okay, for openers, you don't have a car. That's why you drove me. Which is exactly how I know you don't have a car. Also, you barely know how to use a cell phone, so, what if something happens? You're in the middle of nowhere. You would be literally stranded. I'm looking after a comatose woman in a country cabin. I mean, look at this place, it's like an Airbnb. Yeah, super nice Airbnb, even comes with its own little check-in receptionist who's also married to Satan. And then the host stays with you in a coma. Five-star review. You're the one who talked me into taking this job. Yeah, because I thought you needed a change of scenery. - Yeah, this is it. - That's not what I meant. - Alma's gone now. - Could you just stop? Shut up, just stop! Look me in the eye and tell me you're not taking this job just because of you and your mom, 'cause there are a lot of similarities here I can't ignore. Listen, I'm staying. And I would really appreciate your support on this. Okay, fine. Better give me your land line because you and phones... I already texted it to you. Oh, you do know how to use a cell phone. Look at you, going into the 21st century. I'm proud of you. You're fuckin' insane. - Really sweet, thank you. - Yeah, I know. I love you too, bitch. [Elly scoffs] [car door closes] [car engine starts] [pensive music playing] [beads rattling] [monitor beeping] [door creaks] Ms. Ambrose, my name is Elly. Now, I understand you like your privacy and I respect that, but if you need anything, day or night, don't hesitate to call me. I'll be here. Okay, so I'm just going to pull the covers down here. Make sure you're nice and tight... there. [dramatic soundtrack plays] Ms. Ambrose. Hello, how are you? [emitting guttural sounds] [mother] Eleanor! Get in here! [door creaking, clattering] [crows cawing] [scratching noises] [humming "You Are My Baby Girl"] [stops humming] And no microwave. [mother] Eleanor! [faintly] Eleanor!

[song playing faintly in distance] [monitor beeping] [fire crackling softly] [beeping stops] [dramatic soundtrack rises] [fly buzzing] [telephone ringing] [monitor beeping] [ringing] [needle scratching record] [ringing continues] Hello. Ambrose residence. [Beth, melodramatically] Hello, Nurse Gamble. Hey, what's up? Just thought I'd call and check in. Tried your cell, but per usual, you threw it in the middle of the ocean somewhere. Sorry, I was sitting with Ms. Ambrose and I had some music playing. Oh, it sounds romantic. [chuckles] Not exactly, you weirdo. Oh, so I found some old records, and they all had "Dorothy Ambrose" written on them... I guess that's the daughter? You mean the one that went away some time ago? Do you really think she'll come back? Okay, are you having a delayed freakout? 'Cause I can still come and get you. No, I'm fine. Thank you for the vote of confidence. Listen, it turns out that I'm off Sunday, so how about I come down there, bring you some real food, perhaps some real booze? I mean, that does sound tempting. Don't know what I'm gonna do with all these microwave dinners. [mother] Eleanor. [Beth] Elly? Yeah? What is it? Um... nothing. But I should go. Okay, just.. I look out for yourself, okay? Yes, nurse. I'll see you Sunday. Night. Night. [window thuds] [ominous music rising] [thuds] [thuds] [door creaks] Looks like someone's trying to scare you is all. Well, they succeeded. I'll look into it, but I don't think you need to worry, ma'am. It's probably some kids. Do kids even live around here? It just feels pretty isolated. Yeah, you're right about that, it is isolated. But there's some farmland that borders the property. I'll ask around and see if anybody saw anything. Okay. The place has a bit of a history is all. A history of...? It's superstitious stuff that people like you and me pay no attention to. But I'll check back in if I find anything. How long you planning on sticking around for? Just until Monday. An ambulance is gonna come take Ms. Ambrose to the hospital. Dorothy took ill? No, Dorothy's away. I'm looking after her mother. Old Ms. Ambrose? Yeah, that's right. I thought she died. Oh, no. Well, she had a stroke, but... still hanging in there. [dispatcher speaking indistinctly on police radio] All right. Well, I better get going. Yeah. - Good night, ma'am. - Thank you for coming. Oh, any time. Have a good night. Good night. [insects chirruping] [fly buzzing] Hey. What's your name? My name's Elly. You live around here? [girl running] [Beth] If you insist on staying there, then I insist on looking into that Alma lady, for real. She creeps me out. Okay, and how do you propose to do that? My dad has this investigator, I think his name's Novak. He uses him only in criminal cases, but he's really, really good. You're serious? Damn straight, I'm serious. Just don't go too far from that old telephone and watch your back, girl. [clattering] [warbling noises] [high-pitched whistling] [whistling and warbling continue] [woman] Come and gaze at his blaze of fire, where winged embers rise to kindling choir! He is darkness. He is whispers. He is sweet inside your heart. He is heat, he is smoke... he is fire in your throat. [flies buzzing] Dorothy, is that you? My name's Elly. Alma hired me to look after your mother. I hope you don't think I'm intruding. [clatter, rattling noises] [door creaking] - [ominous soundtrack playing] - [flies buzzing] [monitor beeping] Ms. Ambrose, did you say something? [flies buzzing] [door slams] [ominous soundtrack playing] [mother, angrily] Eleanor! I told you you could never leave me again. Do you hear me, Eleanor? Do you hear me? I'll always be with you! No! No! No! No! [sobbing] [shrieking] [Beth] So, what did Novak find? [man] It's what he didn't find that bothers me, a record of any Alma Whitelorn. Maybe she's just a family friend helping out? Novak asked around. Nobody's ever heard of this Alma woman. Far as he knows, it's just Ms. Ambrose and a daughter. - Dorothy? - Right. She's listed as the mother's next-of-kin. Look, pumpkin. There's something else. There's rumors about this place going way back. Now, I know most of it sounds like old campfire ghost stories to me... - But? - But... I've never seen my guy so spooked. If I were you, I'd pull Elly out of there. He thinks it's all kinds of wrong. - Novak said that? - Mm-hmm. Fuck. I mean shit. I mean... Sorry, Dad. [gasps] Didn't mean to startle you. Just paying a quick visit. I'm Mary Lynn Crandon, and this is my daughter Sadie. Hi. I'm Elly. Sadie's here to apologize. So you were the one who threw the apple with the note? She meant well, but... she just went about it all wrong. Apologize to the lady. It's okay, there's no real harm done. Did you wanna come in for some coffee or... [Mary] No. I have to run some errands in town. I'd be happy to drop you off at the bus station. What is she looking at? [ominous music playing] [Mary] A bad memory. You've got no business being here. I'm a nurse, I'm here to care for Ms. Ambrose. I know something about Ms. Ambrose that you don't. And what's that? She's dead. Um... hi. Excuse me. I'm looking for one of those... Shoot, I don't know the name. They're like in all the horror movies and like investigator... shows, whatever. They're like micro... Oh! Micro fish. I think you mean a "microfiche"? I have one. I can show you if you like. I would love that. [mouthing words] She's dead? That's not possible. What's in that back bedroom is a demon in a shell, nothing more. That's enough. I locked them up together in hell with the crucifix I carved in her throat. [whispering] Your daughter is right here. [Mary] That wicked Jezebel, Dorothy Ambrose, wants her mother out, but the only way it will let her go is if it has a nice young body to slip into. That's where you come in. Get out of here, or I'll call the cops. And I know your daughter has my phone, I want it back now. She's no thief. She only came here to warn you. Why doesn't she speak instead of sneaking around leaving horrible notes? Sadie. [Elly] Oh, my... [singing indistinct lyrics] [Mary] The doctors said it looked like her tongue had been chewed off in the womb. I know that whatever did the chewing is still in there. Dormant. I see it sometimes. The way she looks right straight through me or when she's staring off into space. But don't think I won't be ready for the day it wakes up. Thomas... my husband? He gave into temptation, just once. But when he tried to break it off with Dorothy, she became fixated on him. When he rejected her, she had a breakdown. She told her mother that he'd been spreading filthy lies about her, and then she went and ran off like a coward. "Dorothy Ambrose, pictures from..." [Mary] So Ms. Ambrose put a hex on Thomas and his unborn children. That's how Sadie came to be one of the accursed. What did you get yourself into, Elly? I'm sorry, do you really expect me to believe in curses? We were skeptics too. Until our second. Lily. She wasn't as strong as Sadie. Died a week after she was born. [sighs] Thomas blamed himself. So one night he came out here... and he hung himself from this tree. Sadie found him the next morning. Froze pretty bad. Oh, my God. "He who is hanged is accursed of God." Deuteronomy 21:23. I'm so sorry, Mary Lynn. Well, I took my revenge. Although we're not done yet, Sadie and me. Maybe you should stop now, just call it even. Even? What if something happens to Sadie? What if you get yourself arrested? What kind of example are you setting? You don't have a daughter, do you? - No. - Well, if you did, you'd know there's no stopping them turning into you, sure as night follows day. [sighs] She covered her neck, didn't she? What? Look, you can bury your head in the sand if you want, but mark my words, we will burn down this cabin. I thought you were off tonight. - I am. - Okay, so what did I tell you about getting yourself a life? Yeah, still working on that. Listen, if a patient is checking into a private room on Monday, would that be in the system yet? You trying to shack up with the patients again, Beth? Uh, fuck you. No, I am checking on a friend's mother. So could you do me a huge favor and please just run her name through the system? I mean, I could, but you owe me a margarita. - Yeah, fine, whatever. - Okay. A-M-B-R-O-S-E. Ambrose. Yeah, there's nothing here for the next 30 days. [fire crackling] [ominous music rising] Eleanor. [flies buzzing] [distorted whispering] You are my baby girl. And I'll always love you. You'll be my best friend 'til the end. I'll never leave you. When the night is cold, I'll be there to warm you. Every dream you had before, we'll make them all come true. 'Cause you're my baby girl, and I'll always love you. You'll be my best friend 'til the end. I'll never leave you. [monitor beeping] Ms. Ambrose, can you hear me? [ominous soundtrack] [door creaking] [line ringing] Oh, no. [woman] Sorry, this number is not currently in service. Shit. [breaking eggs] Shit. [line ringing] Come on, Elly. [ringing continues] [woman] Please leave your message... Come on, goddamn it! [table rattles] - [line ringing] - Come on, come on, come on. Answer the phone, damn it! - [woman] Sorry, this number... - Fuck! You should just breathe. [thunder crashes] Dad? It'll all be over soon, Eleanor, just one more. [hatch clatters] Oh! [faint, vague noises] [soft creaking] [garbled dial tone] [beads rattling] Alma, is that you? - [phone chimes] - Please. [sighs] Thank you, little-fat-baby-Jesus! [monitor beeping] [ominous music playing] Ms. Ambrose! Ms. Ambrose. Eleanor! [Elly whimpering] After Daddy abandoned us, at least we had each other. But when you left too, I was scared. I couldn't survive without you. I had to bring you back. You'll be my best friend 'til the end. I'll never leave you. [ominous soundtrack playing] [screaming] Hello? El? I brought your favorite. [fly buzzing] Eww! [shower running] Elly, it's me. [laughing] Oh, my God. How long have you been in here? I brought wine to celebrate because I was on my way to save you from that crazy house when I got your text. I have so much tea to spill on that crazy little bitch, I don't even know where to start. [shower running] Elly? Elly, come on, you're freaking me out. [faucet handle creaks] - [ominous music rising] - [blade slicing] You want to go downstairs? [kicks] [thuds] [Beth vocalizing] I know... I know... Speak if you have something to say! [Beth] I know your secret, you two-faced cunt! [mother] You left me! [demonic voices mocking, laughing] [vocal pitch lowering] I'll never leave you... [angrily] Where did you go?! [mocking and laughter continue] You're my baby girl! [garbled voices mocking] You left me all alone! - Shh! - [voices fade] [blues record playing] [siren wailing] [approaching footsteps] - [knock on door] - [Green] Open up, please. - It's Officer Green. - Come in. Look, it's not safe here. Oh, you got that right. Now, we got a tip that a woman named Mary Lynn Crandon is gonna burn this place down tonight, so I came here to warn you and escort you into town. Okay, great, let's go. What about Ms. Ambrose? Um... she's dead. - I thought you said... - I know. I know, I was misinformed. She still back there? Look, I don't know what the hell that thing is in the bedroom but I was lured here for something. - Lured? - [bell chimes] I thought you said she was dead. We need to leave now. I'm not leaving some old sick woman to be burnt up in her bed by some nut. - Look, you can't go back there. - [bell chimes] You can wait out front with my partner if you like. [beads rattling] Fuck! Officer Green, don't go in there! Just wait outside. Ms. Ambrose? Ma'am, are you in here? - [thuds] - Oh! [distant siren wailing] [game sound effects on phone] [groans] - [Elly] Open up! - Back away from the door! Get out of there now! [Green] Step away from the door! [Elly] She's not human, you have to get out! [banging] Officer Green, please! Please listen to me, I was set up! You have got to get out! Please! [knocking] Please! Just listen to me, you have to listen to me. You have to get out now! [ominous music rising] Officer Green, open the door right now! [banging] Please! [Elly sobbing] Please! [knocking] What the fuck? [screams] [game sound effects playing] Officer Green? [slopping, gurgling noise] [Elly gasping, whimpering] [door slams] Help! [game sound effects playing] - Officer! - What happened to you? Uh... It's a long story. Wait, where is my partner? She killed him. - Who? - Ms. Ambrose. I need to find out what the hell's going on here. Get in that house... [Elly whimpering] Beth? Oh, Beth. Oh, my God. It's gonna be okay. [gasping] I'm so tired. [gasping] [ominous music rising] Alma? What did you do? [ominous soundtrack pulsing] [fire crackling] Alma, please... Now, hush. This won't hurt a bit, Eleanor. Everything's gonna be okay. [Alma] There, there. All done. Where is she? Shh! Your mother brought you here a long time ago. You were just a girl. I gave you an apple. She wanted to put a curse on your deadbeat daddy, but she didn't have any money to pay with, so she paid in blood. Your blood, Elly. - A curse for a curse. - [thunder crashes] My mother stored it in the cellar in case she'd ever need it, but you destroyed it tonight, and now I'm calling in the debt. You're out of your fucking mind. [coughs] Your mother always knew this day would come. That's why she came back. That's why she hanged herself, to offer you up. It's your fate, Elly. Then why did you have to kill Beth, you psycho bitch? [Alma humming "You Are My Baby Girl"] It's a catchy song. I can see why you hum it all the time. [Elly whimpering] Wait, wait, wait! Wait. Dorothy... I know you're Ms. Ambrose's daughter. You don't have to pretend anymore. I get what it's like to look after a sick parent. You were right, it's not easy. Believe me, I know. Listen, Mary Lynn told me everything. I don't blame you for running away. Fuck. I lied to you about why I was volunteering. I couldn't handle looking after my mother. I was scared of her, I was scared of turning into her, so I ran way, just like my dad. I left her when she needed me most. And she killed herself. I know your pain, Dorothy. My name is Alma. [screaming] [chuckles] [whimpering] There's your friend. In your face! Always had an answer for everything! Well, I fooled her, didn't I? [laughing] Now, swallow her down! [Elly sobbing] [gagging] [Alma laughing] [sobbing] This is a ritual my mother taught me. Are you ready... to gaze into hell? "Come and gaze at his blaze of fire, where winged embers rise to kindling choir!" "He is darkness, he is whispers, he is sweet inside your heart." "He is heat, he is smoke, he is fire in your throat." Ms. Ambrose? "I invite you to rise out of your shell." "I implore you to visit us from hell." He is coming for his fresh vessel! [flies buzzing] [laughing] Yes! No... What's happening? No... - What's happening to her? - [flies buzzing] [crackling] [Alma gasping] [low snarling] Take her! [shrieking] You! Curse you! You tried that already. [Alma gagging] [flies buzz fiercely] "Demon, O Demon, take back now to part well of flame that floods the heart." "Demon, O Demon, return to thine host, rejoin thine legion, abandon this host!" - [flies buzzing] - "Retreat now, O Dark One." "Scatter your ashes to the winds." "He's brightness, he's singing, he's the balance for the blood." "He is ice, he is pain, he is lightning, and he is rain." [snarling] [glass shatters] [flies buzzing] [demon screaming] [blade clangs] [demon moaning] Let's go! [snarling] [mother] Eleanor! Don't leave me! [demon snarling] [door slams] Hey, Elly, I'm gonna grab a coffee. - Want anything? - I'm okay, thank you. ♪ You are my ♪ ♪ Baby girl ♪ ♪ And I'll always love you ♪ ♪ You'll be my best friend ♪ ♪ 'Til the end ♪ ♪ I'll never leave you ♪ ♪ When the night is cold ♪ ♪ I'll be there ♪ ♪ To warm you ♪ ♪ Every dream you had ♪ ♪ Before ♪ ♪ I'll make them ♪ ♪ All come true ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're my baby girl ♪ - [screaming] - ♪ And I'll always love... ♪ [ominous soundtrack playing] [Metallica] ♪ There's a devil waitin' outside your door ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ There's a devil waitin' outside your door ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ And he's buckin' and brayin' ♪ ♪ And pawin' at the floor ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ And he's howlin' with pain and crawlin' up the wall ♪ - ♪ How much longer? ♪ - ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ And there's a devil waitin' outside your door ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ And he's weak with evil and broken by the world ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ And he's shoutin' your name and he's askin' for more ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ Give him more, give him more ♪ ♪ There's a devil waitin' outside your door ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Loverman ♪ ♪ Since the world began ♪ ♪ Forever, amen ♪ ♪ 'Til the end of time ♪ ♪ Take off that dress ♪ ♪ I'm comin' down ♪ ♪ I'm your lover man ♪ ♪ 'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am ♪ ♪ I is for love, baby ♪ ♪ And O is for only you that I do ♪ ♪ And V is for lovin' virtually all that you are ♪ ♪ And E is for lovin' almost everything you do ♪ ♪ R is for rape me and M is for murder me ♪ ♪ And A is for answerin' all of my prayers ♪ ♪ N is for knowin' your lover man's goin' ♪ ♪ To be the answer to all of yours, yeah ♪ ♪ Loverman ♪ ♪ 'Til the bitter end ♪ ♪ While the empires burn down ♪ ♪ Forever and ever and ever, ever, amen ♪ ♪ Loverman ♪ ♪ So help me, baby ♪ ♪ So help me, baby ♪ ♪ 'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am ♪ ♪ What I am ♪ ♪ I'll be your lover man ♪ ♪ There's a devil crawlin' along your floor ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ There's a devil crawlin' along your floor ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ With a tremblin' heart ♪ ♪ He's comin' through the door ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ With his strainin' sex in his jumpin' paws ♪ - ♪ How much longer? ♪ - ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ There's a devil crawlin' along your floor ♪ ♪ How much longer? ♪ ♪ And he's old and he's stupid ♪ ♪ And he's hungry and he's sore ♪ ♪ And he's lame and he's blind ♪ ♪ And he's dirty and he's poor ♪ ♪ Give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more ♪ - ♪ How much longer? ♪ - ♪ Give me more ♪ ♪ There's a devil crawlin' along your floor ♪ - ♪ How much longer? ♪ - ♪ Oh, yes ♪ ♪ Loverman ♪ ♪ Now here I stand ♪ ♪ Forever, amen ♪ ♪ 'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am ♪ ♪ So forgive me, baby ♪ ♪ My hands are bound ♪ ♪ And I got no choice ♪ ♪ No, I got no choice, no ♪ ♪ I'll say it again ♪ ♪ I is for love and O is for oh yes I do ♪ - ♪ Whoo! ♪ - ♪ And V is for virtue ♪ ♪ So I ain't gonna hurt you ♪ ♪ E is for even if you want me to ♪ ♪ R is for render unto me, baby ♪ ♪ M is for that which is mine ♪ ♪ A is for any old how, darlin' ♪ ♪ And N is for any old time ♪ ♪ Loverman ♪ ♪ I got a master plan ♪ ♪ To take off your dress ♪ ♪ And be your man ♪ ♪ Seize the throne ♪ ♪ And seize the mantle ♪ ♪ And seize that crown ♪ ♪ 'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am ♪ ♪ What I am ♪ ♪ Your lover man ♪
