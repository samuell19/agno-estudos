FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM "Behold her, "single in the field. "Yon solitary Highland lass, "reaping and singing by herself. "Stop here, or gently pass. "Alone she cuts and binds the grain, "and sings a melancholy strain. "Oh listen, for the Vale profound "is overflowing with the sound. "No sweeter voice was ever heard "in springtime from the cuckoo-bird. "Breaking the silence of the seas "among the furthest Hebrides. "Will no one tell me what she sings? "Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow "for old unhappy far-off things and battles long ago. "Whate'er the theme, the maiden sang "as if her song could have no ending. "I saw her singing at her work and o'er the sickle bending. "The music in my heart I bore, "long after it was heard no more." It's crazy, I have read that poem a million times and it's now only just coming to life. Well, that's Wordsworth for you. This is what I meant about his connection to the natural world. He believed that poetry should be written to provide pleasure through a rhythmic and powerful expression of emotion. It's risky to say what we're feeling. Scary, even. Well, I have to admit, I was a little scared about taking this class, but I've actually really enjoyed it. Are you coming back next semester? Dr. Tompkins will be back from sabbatical, but I am... I'm working on it. Well, I hope so, you have been incredible. Great example of hyperbole. You've clearly been paying attention. And as a thank you, I got you some of that British chocolate that you love. My friend brought it back from her studies abroad. You're my favorite student. I try. - See you later. - Bye. Next. Dr. Lambert? Dean Grant. May I? Please. Looks like you've made a lot of fans here over the last three months. Well, luckily I happen to be teaching my favorite subject. Well, it shows, Joss. Well, hopefully it will give me a better shot at my interview next month. I know that tenure track positions are extremely competitive so if there's anything else I can do to stand out... Well, getting the interview in the first place is half the battle. But... I just heard from the Literary Review. They kicked your paper back. You're kidding. They're intrigued by your dissection of Wordsworth's work, but they're not feeling like you're saying anything new. Something is missing. Also your lack of published work is a problem. I've been published. But it hasn't been cited or won any awards. Department funding is vital for this. Funding... You know I'm on your side. Yes, I'm sorry. They're giving you two weeks to re-submit. You know, when I was your age, there were a lot of roadblocks, and I pushed through and I worked hard. Sometimes I thought I couldn't do it, but I did. And I know you can too... Joss? Are you okay? I'm fine. Two weeks. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. I don't get it, you've taught at five different universities. Sure, places that are smaller, and where your teaching ability matters more than how many books I haven't published. Yes, but you served on the faculty committee at this one. And you organized that week-long reading retreat last year, which was incredible, by the way. I wish that mattered, Gwen, but you know the saying. It's publish or perish. That mentality is too intense for me. That's why I love being a librarian. The most pressure I face is collecting late fees. Which you are horrible at. I know, I'm a real softy. I just wish I knew how to get out of my head about this. Actually, I've been carrying this around all week just waiting for the right time to give it to you. What's this? It's a present. From your mom. When was this? About a year ago, when her health started taking a turn. You know Carol, always putting everyone else first. Open it. She gave me specific instructions to give this to you two weeks before your 35th birthday. Cornwall... It's my job to make sure you go. This was the year I promised we would finally go visit her family farm, the one that she grew up on. She wanted to show me the literary festival. She thought of everything. Airfare, taxi, train fare. This ticket is for Monday. Better start packing. I can't just pick up and go to England. What better place to write a paper about English poets than England? What do I tell the dean? You could come up with a million reasons not to do this, but you made her a promise. You've barely done anything for yourself since she passed away. She wanted this for you. What if something happens? Like what? Killer sheep? You know what I mean. What if my anxiety gets really bad over there? Then you use the techniques your doctor gave you. In the meantime, eat right, exercise, and take your meds. You can call me anytime you want. In fact, you should call me often so I can live vicariously through you. Go, Joss. You need this. Tegan, love, I think the chickens have had quite enough breakfast for the moment. They're looking quite plump as it is, sweetheart. Tegan? Penny for your thoughts? I just don't know why they're making us read our poems at the festival. Because you've been working hard on them, and letting the kids read one of their poems at the festival is a tradition. We're not even done with them yet. What if I don't finish? What if I mess up? Hey. That's the beauty of creative writing. You can't go wrong, 'cause anything you say is original. Okay? - Okay. - Yeah? Come one. There we go. Right. Now nip inside, grab your backpack before Gran realizes we haven't left yet, all right? Forgetting something, are we? Good girl, okay. Thanks, Gran. Glad I could be of service. You two should be long gone. It's my fault, I was feeding the chickens. It was my fault, I was stripping the bed in the guest cottage. Just trying to keep on top of the bookings. You're trying to drive me mad is what you're doing. I already changed them. Right, well then. Just making double sure. I don't know why I bother. If that next booking ever turns up, I'll be amazed. They reserved it nearly a year ago and never confirmed. At least they paid in full. How you got me playing chambermaid, I shall never know. I think it rather suits you. I'm sure you're tickled pink. Now it's your turn to play chauffeur and get this little princess to school. Right, come on, you. With pleasure. Your grace. Your lordship. Good boy. Hey! You okay? You were looking the wrong way. Wish I could say it was the first time it's happened here. You all right? Yeah. Can I have my arm back? Of course, I'm sorry. I can help you with that. Are you my driver? Only if you're Jocelyn Lambert. Everyone calls me Joss, but yes, yes, that's me. Welcome to Cornwall. I'm Daniel. What are you smuggling in here? - Books. - Books? We've got libraries full of them here. Actually, we're quite well-known for our written word. All right, party is over. In the back with you. Come on, Samson, in the back. It's okay, I can sit in the back. He's just being stubborn. He'll get there. Come on, Samson. I prefer it, actually. Real classy, mate. Direct route or scenic? I'll let you choose. It's a no-brainer for me. Is it ready? Patience, my lovely. You have to let it brew. Why don't you use a teabag like dad? Because ladies use loose leaf, like the queen. Daddy just presses on the bag with a spoon. So does Tarzan, I suppose. But if you want to do it properly, you'll do it as I've shown you. Now you always put the milk in first. Before you fill the teacup. Not everything can be done on a whim no matter what your father tells you. What about jam and clotted cream? Jam first, of course. Felix! Just finish your scone. Hello, Felix. Mrs. Carter. You're looking lovely today. May I ask why you're disturbing my sheep? I take it Danny failed to mention that I would be stopping by today. He most certainly did. Brilliant. If it's about those monstrosities, you can save your breath and my time. They're wind turbines, Mrs. Carter, not Voldemort. It's all right to speak of them. I know what they are, Felix. I just don't want them. Well, shall we go in for a cuppa and have one of your famous scones? I don't remember inviting you to tea and scones. Come on, look, she's holding them up in the window, isn't she? That's my granddaughter. She's having scones. Here's Danny now. Do you want to tell me what this is all about? Hi, I'm sorry, I'm Joss. I'm staying at the cottage. Well, that's lovely dear, but I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to that driver of yours. I asked Felix to come by to explain our options. It's a great opportunity in a growing industry. We have an industry, sheep. You've already turned my mill house into a cheap motel. Forgive me if I don't want the rest of the farm looking like an Orwell novel. I'm sorry about my mother, she's in one of her moods. I take it you didn't talk to her, then. I was working up to it. You're not just my driver, are you? I wear many hats. Too many, if you ask me. Right, I'll be off. It was lovely to meet you, miss. Hope you have a pleasant stay. And give me a buzz. Excuse me for not introducing myself properly. I'm Daniel Carter. Some say I run the farm around here. I say the farm runs me. Right this way. So you have your own washing machine downstairs. That's great. Do you have a printer, by chance? No, not here, but we have one in the house, so just knock and you can use it anytime. Which is also where breakfast is served, - usually by my mother. - Oh, okay. I know she comes off a bit gruff, she doesn't mean anything by it. I did appreciate the Orwell reference, though. Yeah, she's very well-read, but sharp minds have sharp tongues. Consider yourself warned. Well, I'm sure your knackered, so I'll let you settle in. And if you need the Wi-Fi code, it's in the guest book under my mobile number. If you have any questions, best to ask me. And if you want to stretch your legs, the sea is up and over the hill a bit. You can't miss it. Thank you. "Flopsy and Mopsy and Cottontail "had bread and milk and blackberries for supper." "The end." So, do you want to tell me about your day now? It was fine, dad. Fine? That's all I get? Okay then. Well, you should get to sleep. So, good night, good night, mind the bedbugs don't bite. Dad, stop! Okay, okay. Suit yourself. I love you. I love you too. What if something happens? They're giving you two weeks to resubmit. Okay, Mom. I'm here. Now what? Felix is coming by today. I thought we'd settled that matter. We're just having a coffee. Good. Try to keep your grand ideas to a minimum. I'm trying to put my business degree to work out here. You traded in livestock futures. And what's that supposed to mean, exactly? You were hardly the Wolf of Wall Street, were you? More like the sheep of Southampton. I can still hear you. All I'm saying is the country suits you. Hi there, buddy! Sampson, no! It's okay, we've met. But I haven't met you yet. I'm Joss. I'm Tegan. Dad says I'm not supposed to bother the guests. You're not bothering me. Tell me, Tegan, has he ever eaten your homework? - No. - No? Well, maybe he could eat mine. You have homework? Sort of, I'm just writing a research paper, which is proving trickier than I thought. I find writing tricky, too. Is it? Sometimes. Well, I'm a teacher, so if you ever have any questions or you need any help, feel free to ask, okay? Thanks! As long as it's okay with your mom and dad. It's just my Dad. Well, and Gran, of course. Okay, well, make sure you ask her too, yeah? Are you afraid of her? What, of your Gran? It's quite all right. My friend Lily is afraid, too. But she's really lovely to me. I'm sure she is. First bell is in 15, are you ready? Yeah. How'd you sleep? Okay. That doesn't sound very convincing. Sorry, no, I can't even blame it on the jetlag. I'm just not a great sleeper. It has nothing to do with the cottage. Maybe the fresh air will help with that. Any plans? No, I just have this research paper to work on. You flew all this way to work? Big deadline coming up. Well, good luck. - Thank you. - Come on, you. Your turn to drive, Teeg. Really? Yeah! No, no. Not really. "Let's get out of this mizzle "and have one of your famous scones," and she said, "You're not invited!" - No... - Yeah! I mean, I've jumped that fence 1,000 times. Who knew that this was going to be the final straw, eh? Where is she, anyway? Out with her precious sheep. Great, so we can talk more freely. Every month, it gets more strained. Every suggestion I make, she hates. I thought she would have been thrilled to see you and Tegan at the farm. Tegan, yeah, but she treats me like the Spanish invading Cornwall. I mean, a little warning would have been nice. Come on, you know my mum. I do, she acts tough, but we both know that I've been her favorite since primary school. - Debatable. - Come on! Look, I'm sorry, but all these half measures you're doing to try to diversify the farm, well, we know they're not going to make much difference, are they? This... this is your long-term. What, leasing my land to you? Not me. These beauties. I mean, she does have a point, they do look rather dystopian. More science fiction, if you ask me. Don't look at me like that. It was your idea in the first place. I know. But I also know what she's going to say. That we're sheep farmers, that's who we are, that's who we've always been. And that they're going to ruin the landscape she built with my father. - Not totally. - No, not totally. I just need to find the right time. All right, well, they're not gonna wait around much longer. They'll simply just offer the contract to someone else. So can I check in next week? - Yeah. - Right. Am I going to see you at Harbor's Head this weekend? Two o'clock? Lily is requesting Tegan's presence. No, I've got so much work to do on the farm. We'll be there. Good lad. See you soon. "Behold her, single in the field. "Yon solitary Highland Lass. "Reaping and singing by herself. "Stop here, or gently pass." Mom? Hey there, buddy. What are you up to? Not much, he hasn't lifted a paw to help me. Quite the wall. It's built the Cornish way. You put mud between the stones so the plants can grow between them. Fascinating. And very tedious. I've been at it a year and still haven't fixed half the problems. Sounds a bit like my research paper. A bit mucked up, then? So what brings you out here? Just stretching my legs, ruminating. Procrastinating. Do you want a hand? I'd rather build a wall than bang my head against one. All right, but you will get dirty. It's okay, my B&B has a laundry machine. Posh. Here. And you use this. Thanks, So, you're a literature professor? What got you into that? Well, my Mom and my grandparents introduced me to the classics when I was, well, probably Tegan's age. Is that why you bring all your books with you? It's for my research on Wordsworth. The footballer. The poet. He's English. Don't tell me you haven't heard of him. Of course I've heard of him. "Nature never did betray the heart that loved her." Mick Jagger. Stop it. So, why here? Why, on this whole island, you chose this bit? This farm? Because this is where my mom grew up. You're kidding. No, believe it or not, my grandparents, Pat and Colin Penberthy, are the ones who sold the farm to your parents. That's fascinating. We always wanted to come here, my Mom and I. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. We planned on it, but time just... Ran out. She passed away last year. I'm so sorry. Me too. You know, having grown up here myself, I can say she was a lucky woman. It's a beautiful place. Have you been here your whole life? No, I went to uni in London. I did my master's in business. Actually, I used to work in global markets. Futures, mainly. And you gave all of that up to come back and work on the land? How romantic of you. No, I came back to help my Mum sort things out. She won't admit it, but she's older than she thinks. And, yeah. Unfortunately, it's more work than even I can handle. Well, we should get busy then. Hey, Gwen, sorry I missed your call again. I was out building a rock wall. I will tell you about it when we connect, but until then, tag, you're it. Okay, bye. Hi. Is everything okay? Gran said I have to do some homework before training today, and I still might need a little bit of help if that's okay. Of course. It's just a silly short poem, but every year, they make the year two kids read them at the festival. Have you gotten any feedback yet from your teacher? We have to read in front of the class, so no, not yet. I asked to go last. Well, I would be happy to take a look. I haven't gotten very far. That's okay. But so far, is it right? There's no right or wrong in creative writing. That's what my dad says. Well, I agree. Have you tried mind-mapping? I don't know what that is. It's a really useful tool, and I would be so happy to show you. Okay. But I've got to go to training now, so maybe tomorrow? I'll be here all day, so anytime. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Hi, Lily! Using the family door now, are we? I'm sorry, I didn't... No, no, no, don't worry. You are technically our guest, I suppose. How can I be of service? Sorry. Thank you, Mrs. Carter. Is Daniel back from the field? That boy does what he likes when he likes. May I ask why? I have a question for him. Is this about your accommodation? I told him people would expect a fancy resort. Not a drafty old mill room. No, it's actually... it's about Tegan. You have a question about my granddaughter? No, not exactly, I... I found her notebook. - Thank you. - Yeah. I'm sure she'll be quite pleased. Is that all? That's all, yes. Very well. Okay. Daniel? Daniel! Good morning. Wasn't expecting to see you out this early morning. Doing some early morning procrastination? I actually wanted to ask you something. Has Tegan been struggling with reading and writing for awhile? What makes you say that? She asked me for some help with a poem. She shouldn't have been bothering you, I'm sorry. Oh, no, I offered. But I noticed her notebook, and I saw something that concerned me. Concerned you how? I think she may be showing signs of dyslexia. Has her teacher mentioned anything? Just that she might need some extra help reading. She's had a tough time with the move, she's fallen behind a little bit. She's had to put up with more than her fair share in life, but she's smart, she makes great art. That makes sense, 'cause most people with dyslexia, they're highly intelligent. Because they excel in other areas, it can be really hard to spot. My Mom had it. She struggled a lot when she was a kid, but she learned how to manage it. Look, I'm sorry to hear about your mother, but I think you're making a bit of a leap here. I know this is overwhelming, but there's people who specialize in this. And I would also be happy to help. Thanks, but we're sorted. Samson, come here. Come on. Come on, you. That's beautiful, Tegan. What's it called? It's called Sampson the Mighty. Perfect. Why don't you write it up here at the top? Well, it's you're choice, you're the artist. Be back in a mo'. Well, what do you think? I think the professor is poking her nose in where she shouldn't. What if she's right? Maybe I should take her to the doctor to at least rule it out. This is the last thing she needs. What is that supposed to mean? She's already drawn a short straw. What kind of mother leaves her child? I warned you about Catherine, from very the beginning, that she was no good for you, But you wouldn't listen. Do you want to rehash my failed marriage or talk about Tegan? We're going to tuck in Polly, and we're going to tuck in Laney, and we're going to tuck in Dougie. Good night, good night, good night! And you. There we go. Hey. Why didn't you tell me that you were struggling? I didn't want you to worry. I'm not worried. Is this the face of a worried man? You know you can tell me anything. We're a team, right? Okay, Dad. Is Joss going to help me with my poem? Joss is a guest so we shouldn't be bothering her. But I'm going to talk to your teacher and we're going to get everything sorted out at school. Make a plan, yeah? Okay. I just like talking to her, she's nice. Yeah, she is nice. Sleep tight. Don't tickle me! I wouldn't dare. Okay. Does it go away? Does what? Dyslexia? No, it doesn't go away, but there's loads that we can do to make sure it gets a lot better, all right? Okay. Yeah. I love you. I love you too. Tegan hasn't made many connections since we got here. But she really likes you. You know, I don't know what we're dealing with exactly, but... I want to help however we can. So, if your offer still stands? Of course. Goodnight, then. Goodnight. I love what you're saying here. About the river? Yeah, about how it makes you happy. Do you want to try reading the mind map, see how it sounds to you? Let's start here, okay? I ran to the river. Good, good. Keep going. I can't remember what comes next. Well, whatever you want to be next is next. Do you know what I do when I get stuck? I sing. Okay, not well. But it helps me find the rhythm in the words, so I try to sing the poems, and sometimes... I dance them. Are you serious? Yeah, of course, it helps the words just flow out of you. Do you want to see? Okay. I'll do it, but just for you. Ready? ♪ I went out alone ♪ ♪ To sing a song or two ♪ ♪ My fancy on a man ♪ ♪ And you know who ♪ It's silly, but do you want to try? Yes. Alright. ♪ I ran to the river ♪ ♪ To splash around ♪ ♪ Then up the hill to see ♪ ♪ What could be found ♪ ♪ When I reached the top ♪ ♪ I reached to the sky ♪ ♪ And the next thing I knew ♪ ♪ I learned how to fly ♪ Yes! Yes! See? Look at that! Writing doesn't have to all be hard work. It should be fun, too. Says the woman who would rather mend a granite wall than write her paper. Sorry, I didn't mean to break it up. No. That's alright I think we're almost done for the day. Don't you think, Tegan? Besides, I should get back to writing my own paper. I'm still quite stuck actually. Did you try dancing? You know, I'm not sure that would work for the research paper, but I should try it, huh? What you need is a pasty. Yes! Actually, Felix and his wife Isabelle are taking their daughter Lily to the harbor head, and the puppet show. We're gonna get pasties after. You should come along. Yes! You must. I really shouldn't. But maybe a change of scenery would do me good. I would only stay for an hour, though. We'll take it. Alright. Okay, but what is a pasty? Well, let me tell you. Behind you! Behind you! Lovely to see you again, Joss. How are you enjoying Cornwall? It's beautiful so far from what I've seen at least. Surviving Mrs. Carter I presume? Easy! Fell free to ignore him. - I'm Isabelle. - Hi. Felix's incredibly tolerant wife. Nice to meet you. Isabelle runs the marketing for the literary festival. Let's hope you've heard of it. Of course, my mom grew up here, she used to go to it as a child. Is that so? Yeah, she even volunteered for the festival when she was in her 20s. Did she ever submit? Not original work. She wasn't much of a writer herself, but she did memorize all the greats and she would recite one at the final event. How lovely. What's her name? I bet my mother will remember her. - She remembers everything else. - Oh, shush. Carol Lambert. Well, Carol Penberthy was her maiden name. That sounds familiar, but I'll ask her. Joss is a professor of romantic literature. So, connection. - That's brilliant. - Romantic eh? Danny boy over here is a hopeless romantic himself. - Aren't you? - That so? I never answer such questions on an empty tummy. Well, Ashton's mum is taking the girls for ice cream. Right, well, that just means one thing, doesn't it? To the pub. Come on. How do they even think of this? This is, like, genius. The tin miners used to take this down the mines with them, and they would never eat the crusts because their hands were dirty. - I never knew that. - Is that real? So what's the verdict? Traditional or veg? Traditional, definitely. All your meat and veg in one bite. How can you go wrong? Hey, are we still on for Monday? The surveyor? Yeah. Must we talk business? We're having such a good time. You don't have to decide yet, but we will need to know how much, you know, land you'll have to swap out if you decide to go that way. Who wants another beer? Yeah. I will, yeah. I should actually... I should get going. I've just... I've slacked off enough. Yeah, we can go. No. That's okay. You stay. Have fun. I can walk by myself. Just point me in the right direction. Okay, em, we came the more direct route. If you want a more scenic version, then just turn left, and you can't miss it. It's very easy to do. Okay. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, Joss. Thank you for today with Tegan. Of course. We can do more, too. You sure you don't want to stay? Next round's on Felix. I think I should just get back. Right. Or left, it's prettier. It looks like there's four candidates in the running now. Four, how am I supposed to compete with four? I didn't mean to worry you, I just thought you should know. What am I going to do? I only have a week to make this what they want. The paper? Your research is impeccable. I'm sure it just needs a good edit. You'll figure it out. But what if I don't? What if I can't? Joss, I know how much this means to you, and, honestly, you're the best teacher I have. I don't want to lose you. One step at a time. Get the paper in. When you get back, we'll talk about what else you can do to impress the board, okay? Okay. We'll talk soon. This will pass. "And in life's noisiest hour, there whispers still the ceaseless love of thee, the heart's self-solace and soliloquy." Promise you. Alex. Best surveyor in the country. So, what does he think? A good 40%, at least. You know, to allow for the number of wind turbines to satisfy the contract, but once they're in... They take care of themselves? Guaranteed income. As long as the wind blows, and in Cornwall, she always blows. Alright, so what else do you need from me? Nothing much, just an answer. End of week? Yeah. Alex! Looks like you're already coming, great. How you been standing there? Long enough. Mum! Let's talk about this. Why? You seem to have made up your mind for both of us. We agreed that I would take over the farm. To preserve it, not carve it up. You don't understand what I'm dealing with. If it's too much for you, hire some hands. It's not that simple. The markets are changing. England is changing, the whole world in fact. We can't keep holding on to the past. I agreed to the bed and breakfast. Isn't that enough for you? No. I'm doing everything I can. I promise you, I won't make a final decision without your approval. Good. I'm going to the cove. Will you watch Tegan? Be right there. Are you busy at the moment? No. Not at the minute, no. Come on a drive with me. I actually... I'm not busy right now but I really should be getting back to it. I just... I'm so behind and so uninspired. What was that line from the Wordsworth poem? He wrote a lot, which one? The one you quoted me. "Nature never did betray the heart that loved her." That's the one. What don't we get you out to nature? I tried that yesterday and she wasn't very hospitable. Doesn't sound like her. Maybe you need a proper introduction. You mean like a wingman? I don't know what that means, but if you'll come with me, then yes. To be honest, I could use the company. Feeling a bit unmoored at the moment. I'll let you sit in the front. Must get my coat. I'm feeling pretty lucky that I peeled you away from that paper. Please, don't remind me. I'm having enough guilt as it is. - My apologies. - It's just up this way. Wait a minute, I recognize this place from my mom's old home videos. Really? She used to talk about this all the time. She would climb to the clifftop and sit there for hours when she was young, just waiting for the sunset, reading. Taking pictures. It was calming for her. Yeah, we do have proper sunsets. Okay, it's just a little bit further. It doesn't really look safe. You coming? - This will pass. - It's okay. This will pass. You alright? Get the paper in. But what if I don't? It's okay. This will pass. Almost there. I can't. Of course you can. You got this. Just down the path. No, I can't. Okay, we'll turn back. Sorry about that, back there. Nothing to be sorry about. It's my fault for pushing you. I've been dealing with them, anxiety attacks, since I was young. How young? They started when I was nine. I was in a car accident with my dad. He died. I'm so sorry. I was always a reserved kid before, but afterwards the fear just... Just took root and never left. Mom always encouraged me to push past it, take some risks. She actually still is. This whole trip is a birthday present from her. When was your birthday? It's coming up, it's on Saturday. Great! Any fun plans? Well, at the moment, quietly contemplating the course of my life, whether it was a mistake to come here when I should be focused on my professional goals. Is that before or after the cake? Here, this is what I wanted to show you. Why does this make me so happy? I know you're a book worm, but you really take it to the next metamorphosis. What would that be? A book butterfly? If you're calling me a nerd, I'm totally okay with that. I love this quote by Oscar Wilde. "It's what you read when you don't have to, that determines who you will be when you can't help it." For those of us without a degree in English literature, what does that mean? What you choose to fill your mind with... ...has a huge impact on who you are as a person. So, you are what you read. Essentially. That is a scary thought. Which way is the comic book section? I'm going to get us a table at my favorite little cafe. Why don't you find yourself a birthday gift from me? You don't have to do that. I know, but I'm English, being a gentleman comes naturally. Thank you. Gran! I scored a... No boots in the house, dear. Door! That's my girl. Now what were you saying? I scored a goal at training today. That's wonderful! Where's dad? I want to tell him. Your father is out at the moment. That's okay. I can tell Joss then. I'm afraid he's out with Joss. I believe he's driven her to the cove. I'm sorry, dear. That's okay, I like Joss. Do you? Daddy does, too. I can tell. Is that so? I don't know if he fancies her, but he definitely likes her. What do you think? I assure you, I don't know what to think. Off you go. To the bathroom. I don't want you stinking at the dinner table. I am so excited to read this as soon as I get a chance to pleasure read. Thank you. My pleasure. More tea? As long as you don't have to get back. Soon, but I'm lucky. My mother makes an amazing gran. We've become quite the team raising my daughter. Tegan mentioned it's just the two of you. Must be hard. Is that your clever way of asking if I'm single? It wasn't, but now that you mention it. I am, and have been for a long time. Catherine, and I met in London. We got married right after graduation, against our parents' wishes. I was in business school when Tegan was born. And things changed quickly. Her parents cut her off, and we started arguing. A lot. It was difficult. One day, I came home after class and Tegan was with a babysitter. I never saw her again. She just left? She left a note saying that it had gotten too much for her. And... Tegan doesn't remember, though, luckily. In her mind, it's just been the two of us. I'm so sorry. Don't be. It's in the past. Where it belongs. You have an uncanny ability to live in the present. I'm always going over what happened in the past and worrying about what's going to happen in the future. Life's too short to deal with all that stress. All we can do is deal with the problems right in front of us and choose what brings us the most joy. That's beautiful. It's a Carter original. I thought so. Are you okay? All this talk about "joy" and "reading" has me worried about my Tegan. She's going to be alright. I have a meeting coming up with her teacher. Could I trouble you to join me? You make me feel much more comfortable. Of course. Of course. Today we're going to try something a little different. Alright, I'm going to read you the words to one of my very favorite Wordsworth poems. What's a Wordsworth poem? Well, Wordsworth was a man who wrote spectacular poetry. So, you're going to listen to the words, and then you're going to write the words, but with pictures. Sounds hard. Sure, but it's good to have a challenge, you know, like in soccer practice. You mean football? Yes. Yes, I mean football. Okay, should we try it? Here's your pencils. Alright. I wandered lonely as a cloud. That one's easy. That floats on high o'er vales and hills. What's a vale? It's a valley. When all at once I saw a crowd, a host of golden daffodils. Slow down! I can't draw that fast! It's alright. Just try not to be intimidated by the words, listen to them and think about how they make you feel, what they remind you of. Think about the lyrics to your favorite song. The lyrics don't always make sense, but they feel right. Alright, keep going. Beside the lake, beneath the trees, fluttering and dancing in the breeze. Continuous as the stars that shine and twinkle on the milky way, they stretched in never-ending line along the margin of a bay. Ten-thousand saw I at a glance, tossing their heads in sprightly dance. Her symptoms were subtle. I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't seen it before. I appreciate your notes, Dr. Lambert. Of course we will need to get a full evaluation done, starting with our occupational therapist. I did see signs, I just... I thought she was adjusting to her new life here. I thought it was a phase. It's difficult to fully diagnose it unless you know what you're looking for, but early intervention is key. Yeah, I just don't want her to be labeled. That isn't going to happen here. Mr. Carter, it doesn't do us any good being hard on ourselves. We are only responsible for how we handle this with Tegan moving forward. What do we do about the festival? That is completely up to Tegan. If she wants to read her poem, great. Or she can read something else she likes. Or, nothing at all. That's okay too. She can lead the charge on this one. There are no labels here. Only support. You should've just left it up to the teacher. I did. Joss was only there to help. You shouldn't involve her any more than you have. It was the right move. Everything is always a brilliant idea with you, isn't it? Until it's not. Excuse me? You always lead with your heart at the expense of everyone around you. Are we done here? Doesn't look like you are. I've seen your plans. You look through my things? You left them out. Were you going to talk to me about this or just leave me to wake up to the apocalypse? Nothing has been decided yet. Then how do you explain this perfect little map of yours? It's all planned out is it? Just my thoughts on where they should go. I don't want to hear it. You promised me. Imagine how your father would feel if he knew this is what you were going to do to his farm when you took over. And imagine how your mother will feel when she watches her son give his heart away to another woman who is bound to leave. And then he let me pick out - a book for my birthday. - Okay, I think I'm done. With what? Living vicariously through you. I want to browse old books with an Englishman. No fair. So, he's cute? It doesn't matter because he lives in England, and I'm leaving on Sunday. Still could be fun. You know what would be fun is if you got on the redeye, and you came and met me at the festival. That'd be fun. I wish. You know I wish. Did you get your paper in? Nope, nope, nope. No, I did not. What? Why? I thought you needed this. I do or at least, I don't know, everyone keeps telling me that I do, but it's like every time I open my laptop, just this wave of exhaustion just flows over me. Burn out. Do you remember Gareth? The guy I who trained me? He just up and quit. No job, no plan, no nothing. That is terrifying. Or is it brave? I'm sticking with terrifying. Well in that case, you might want to stock up on some Galaxy bars and take another crack at that paper. In that case, I'm going to stay here forever. Love you. Love you, too. Bye. Hi, there. May I use your printer, please? Of course. So sorry to bother you. You're very welcome as long as you know how it works. I'm rather old fashioned, I'm afraid. Oh, well. So am I, believe it or not. It's actually why I need it. Most people prefer to make notes on a computer these days, but I actually like the hardcopy with a red pen. You should see my manuscripts. All the notes in the margins they just look like hieroglyphics. Probably hard to decipher them, but you know, it's my process. It's on the desk in the corner. Thank you. Carol Lambert. She made your reservation, didn't she? My mom. Yeah. What was her maiden name? Penberthy. You know, she actually grew up in this house. My grandparents are the ones who sold it to you. Would you excuse me a moment? Of course. Joss. I have something for you. I found this box about a year ago, when I was clearing out the mill. I assumed it must've been left by your... By your mother. It just looked like some old trinkets, and that tattered book. But I remember thinking at the time, I can't just throw them away. They're someone's treasures. It's from my grandma to my mom. She memorized all these poems, she would recite them to me. I wonder if she knew this was here. Ever since she died, I feel like... something important has gone missing. I keep searching for her, as if she's just out of sight, and if I just look hard enough... That I can find her, again. Loss is a terrible thing. It never completely goes away. I miss her so much. Ah, love. She's still with you. Her love lives inside of you, and you carry her in your heart. I'd give anything to see her again. You will. I'll leave you to it. Take as long as you need. Thank you. The Presence of Love. Oh, mom. Okay, shouldn't be a long meeting. They're just gonna go over the testing with you and introduce you to some key people. Alright? Okay. I know it's not easy. You mean, reading? Just life, in general. There are so many emotions we have to navigate. But... You have me, and you can talk to me about anything, yeah? I know, Dad. Yeah, and it's not just me. There's so many people in your life that love you. You have Isabelle and Felix and Lily, and your Gran, of course. You can talk to any of us about anything whenever you want. I'm glad we came here. To the farm. Me, too, love. Alright. Let's get in there and show them what the Carters are made of. Come on. Let's do it. Someone is still hard at work. No. Not really. Hi! Hi, Joss. No? Yeah. At this point, I'm just reading for pleasure. I hope it's your birthday book. It's your birthday? Tomorrow. Hang on. If you're out here, relaxing, does that mean you turned in your paper? - No. - No? Because I withdrew my application for tenure. - I thought that was the goal. - It was, but I realized that all that tenure is is professional security. I think I confused a secure job with safety. There's no guarantees. Life's a risk. I think I have to embrace it. Really? - Yeah. - Yeah. I didn't quit my job, though, if that's what you're asking. No. I requested to stay on as an adjunct professor for now. The dean already ask me if I want to teach the summer term. Well, this sounds like a decision worth celebrating. I think. Tegan... I have something I want to give you. Come here. - It's for you. - What is it? It's a book of poetry that my grandparents gave to my mom. She had dyslexia, too. Your mom? Yeah. You'll see all of her notations, that she saw the poetry differently than I do, but a beautiful way that's all her own. You'll see. There's no wrong way. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm going to go tell Gran. Okay. Thank you. It's nothing. No. We both know it's everything. I know you were planning on attending anyway, but, we'd really love for you to ride along with us. To the festival? I'd love to. Okay. Brill. - Brill. - Yeah. Do you have everything? - Yes. - I've already checked twice. Third time's a charm. Now, remember, when you're up there, just see how you feel, okay? Look. Could we get a move on? - I want to be right at the front. - I'll meet you in there. - I just need a minute, alright? - Let's make that a British minute, shall we? Not the American interpretation. Of course. I wonder that you will still be talking. Signior Benedick, nobody marks you. What, my dear Lady... There's an exclamation mark. Disdain! ...and the door of your heart. May the road rise up... There was once a day that owed time. With their trouble behind, side by side, then the wolf and the rabbit pushed off to sea and traveled to the one place they could run free. Alright, everyone. It looks like we have one more reading. Hi. I wrote a poem for today, but I'm not going to read it. It wasn't ready. I'm going to read a poem that somebody else wrote instead, a special one from a friend, "The Presence of Love" by Samuel Coleridge. "And in Life's noisiest hour, there whispers still the ceaseless Love of Thee, The heart's Self-solace and soliloquy. You mould my Hopes, you fashion me within... And looking to the Heaven, that bends above you, How oft! I bless the Lot, that made me love you." You did so good! I'm so proud of you. You must thank Ms. Lambert for all her help. Thank you so much. Of course. You were fantastic, and you do know that's my very favorite poem? I didn't have a present to give you, so I wanted to read the poem at the festival for your birthday. Gran helped with the cards, so it's partly from her, too. It was perfect. Now, let's get you a cake. That's a brilliant idea. I don't need a cake. It's your birthday. I know, but it's not a big one. Still, we should go out. Every year should be celebrated. And you, little missy, have your own party to go to. So you should go and join your classmates. - Yes! - Yeah. I'll take her to the party. You two should go out. Tegan, your fans await you. Should we walk around? Yeah. Sure. I still got to get you that cake. It's just a silly birthday. I don't need anything special. This view is enough. What if I want to do more? There's so much I can show you. I'd like that, but... I'm leaving in the morning. Can't believe it's almost been two weeks. Then stay longer. Don't tempt me. I have to get home. Then let's celebrate right now, tonight. I feel like I already did. Right here. This place that she always wanted me to see. The festival we planned to attend. It's easier if I go back now. Can I at least take you to the station tomorrow? Everything has all been so perfect. I think I'd rather just end on this. This? This sounds 19th century... and not very promising. "You lie in all my many thoughts." Okay. Make sure to get the mill in it, yeah? Thank you. - Thanks. - Okay. Hey. I'll miss you. So will I. I'm so glad you got to see this place. Me, too. I'm not sure the experience was quite what you wanted it to be. It was so much more. You give your dad a hug for me. Okay. Thank you. What? I have to tell you something. Your tea method is far superior to mine. I'm glad you've finally come around. Thank you. What about the turbines? Any chance you've come around to those? We have to address it. So let's address it. They are hideous and noisy. They'll be on the far west pasture on the hill. - The noise will be minimal. - And what about the sheep? - What about the sheep? - They won't like it. Well, they told you that, did they? I know this is hard for you. But it's an opportunity that would really help us. I think we should do it. Very well. Go ahead. You have my blessing. It must feel like you're losing everything you hold dear, but I promise you I'll never let that happen. I love this place, too. So does Tegan. We're doing it for her, too, Mum. Come here. Forgive me for what I said to you. It was wicked, and I've regretted it ever since. Your father would be very proud of you, my boy. You're a wonderful man and an excellent father. And you deserve to be loved by someone who cares as deeply as you do. Train to Paddington leaves in two minutes. Joss! Hey. What are you doing here? I need to stop you from getting on that train. - But I... - Please, I've got two minutes to say this to you, so let me just say it. You came to Cornwall for many reasons, and I know that I wasn't one of them. In fact, I'm probably to blame for constantly distracting you from your research paper and... and stopping you from achieving the thing you most wanted to achieve. But in the words of the great English poet, "You can't always get what you want." I repeat. "You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you just might find..." "You get what you need." That's the one. Don't leave, Joss. Use the cottage as a base. Travel the world. Fill up that passport of yours. Eat every single piece of chocolate you can find and... and read every single book that you wanted to, twice. You're an expert in Romantic literature. Don't you think it's time you did something perfectly romantic? I have a life back in Boston. An apartment, friends. A professor once told me that life is a risk. You just have to embrace it. Do you know how scary that would actually be? I know, but you'll have the best wingman. Okay. You sure about this? No. I'm not, but I've been banging my head against the same rock wall for years. May as well try a new direction, see how that goes for a bit. You want to give me a ride back? Direct or scenic? What do you think? You secured a luncheon with Dylan Turner? Well, the kids are so excited he's reading, I just wanted to make the most of it. I mean, between that and the panel of writers you pulled together, you realize this festival is going to market itself? I'm just happy to be a part of it. Not as happy as I am. Although I doubt I'm the most excited one here. I know this is your noisiest hour, but I was wondering if you had the time to take a walk with me. Always. FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
