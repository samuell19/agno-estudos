Okay, thank you very much. Next person. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Good night. If you're not back in before Christmas, have a nice one. Thank you. Long day. ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la ♪ I was wondering... Would you care to have a drink after? Clever. I would, Miles, but I'm busy tonight. Oh. Take a rain check, though. - Rain check. - Look. Don't let me keep you from your little doodles. Nice, huh? Listen, Cullen, I've got a little something going this evening. A problem's come up, and I've got to put in a quick appearance at home. Wonder if you wouldn't mind helping me out and taking Julie over to the Hyatt Regency, keeping her company just till I get there. - Julie? - Mmm. Have a couple of drinks on me. - What is it? - It's a Holacanthus tricolor. - Oh. - I've had one on order for six weeks. Ah. - May I? - Oh, of course. I don't think he does anything. - Do you come here often? - Not especially. You? Never been before, but I've heard a lot about it. I don't like the way they look at you, like they have you coming in through the gate. I didn't know about you and Packard. - How long have the two of you been see... - Not long. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Am I sure? No. - I was just wondering. - I wonder why you wonder. It's not my place to criticize. Ah. - You're criticizing? - Sorry. Are you criticizing me for what I'm doing or for who I'm doing it with? - Let's just drop it. - No. I'm interested. Look, if I waited until I was sure before I did something, I'd end up not doing anything. - What did you say that was called? - What? In the bag... the one you're going home with. An angel fish. Angel fish. That's right. Where did you say it came from? The Caribbean. My, what an interesting hobby. That really must be a fascinating way to pass your time. Have you done it for long? Yes. Well, you two having a good time? Oh, terrific. Well, I guess I'll be running along. Stay and have another drink if you like. Oh, thank you, no. It's getting late, and I'd better get my date back home. - See you tomorrow. - See you later, Cullen. Night. If you don't mind my saying so, Cullen, I think there's a little too much cash on the floor these days. - It's Wednesday. - Yes, I know. But in general. - It's Christmas. You know how it is. - I know! - How did we end up yesterday? - 34,000, 35,000. Well, Cullen, that's too much. Oh, by the way, my wife and I would like to see all of you at a little Christmas party we're giving. Sunday night be all right with you? - Sunday's fine. - Good. Would you mind bringing Julie along with you? I'd just as soon she didn't show up alone. If it's okay with Julie, it's okay with me. It'll be fine with Julie. And I keep the receipts to the safety deposit box here. Under lock and key. If you ever need the keys, which are here, you come to me, all right? - He looks interesting. - What? - Well? - He's nice. That's it? Nice? Come on. He collects fishes. What? Let's just say, in his case, that the total is somewhat less than the sum of the parts. Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Hiya, Frank. Finally. I'm going home. - Hello, Cullen. - How are you, Mr. Fogelman? Busy as hell. Thank God. Even with the rain. I guess we can forget about a white Christmas. Oh, say, a couple of your people came in for lunch a few minutes ago. There's a blonde with them. Tits out to here. Louise. She's new. $4,206. I thank you. Good afternoon. First Bank of Toronto. Santa! Santa! I want a pelican and a train! Oh, you do, do you? - Will I get them? - Oh, yes. - Will I really get them? - Yes. - Percy! - Both of them? - Yes. Both of them. - Percy! Mum, Santa's gonna give me everything I want. - He's got my toys in his pocket. - Not now. Not now. - Not now, kid. - He's got my toys... - That's enough! - Percy! - Mum, Santa's gonna... - I don't think so, dear. Mum, Santa's gonna give me everything I want. Go ahead. I left my checkbook at home. Thank you. Imagine, a Santa Claus who doesn't seem to like children. Merry Christmas. - Hello? - Julie, it's Miles. Oh. Hi. There's something I want to talk to you about. Did I catch you at a bad time? A little. Someone's there? Mm-hmm. Sorry. And then savings withdrawal. That's how they're still in business. And then partial PCA. - Thank you very much. - We'll just do that on the side. Notice anything new? Mistletoe. Oh. Cute. Everyone else has had a turn. Don't let your emotions run away with you. Oh, good morning. Merry Christmas. I'd like to cash this. $550? Do you have identification? Driver's license? Louise, would you check the balance in this account, please? Thank you very much. Happy New Year to you, too. Merry Christmas. First Bank of Toronto. Sorry for the delay. - You ready, then? - Just about. You wanna go to lunch? - No, you go ahead. - Good, I got something to attend to. - Mr. Cullen. - Mr. Fogelman. - Thank you, Cullen. - Merry Christmas. Oh, same to you. First Bank of Toronto. Merry Christmas. I'd like to deposit these. Certainly. - There you are. - Thank you. - All of it. - That's all there is. Look. I saw him make the deposit. Give me the money, you fucker. Hey, you! What the hell? Police! Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Hey! Hey! We feed in what little information we have... eye color, estimated height, robbery while in possession of a firearm, wearing a disguise. Computer does the rest. I was quite a way away. And the beard makes it difficult. Well? No, not really, but it was something like this. - Is that all? - Yeah. Easy to see why he was long gone by the time the squad car got there. - What do you mean? - The alarm went off in the station the same instant the camera started. As you saw, seconds later, he was out the door. Why'd you wait so long to push it? I don't know. I didn't push it, actually. - What is it, the clip? - Yes. - What do you mean the clip? - You tell him. Well, there's a wire clip that presses down on a particular stack of bills in the cash drawer. In my drawer, it's on the hundreds. If you pull out all of the bills, the clip makes contact with a metal plate, completing an electrical circuit, and the silent alarm and camera are activated. No one else in the bank knows you're being robbed. I do. There's a red light goes on by my desk. I'm operations officer. Getting back to the clip, wouldn't the idea be to give him those bills first, give the police as much time as possible? I suppose so. Yes. Yet you gave him... was it the hundreds? You gave him the hundreds last? I don't know why I did that. I didn't think. Don't forget, there was a gun pointing at him. - But you didn't know that then. - What? He didn't take the pistol out till later over by the door. He said he had a gun. The note. That's right. The note. - Is that about it? - Yes. Still can't get over the amount of money at your window. Almost $50,000. The money on the floor has been running very high lately. Yet, if he'd gone to any of the other windows, he'd have only got a fraction of that. It's no secret that I'm the vault teller. Every merchant who banks with us knows that. Maybe. Anyway, it confirms my feeling we're after a professional. Hey. Don't forget your briefcase. Oh, right. Does it get to you in the same way? You feel excited? Me too. I wouldn't have missed it. - Oh, I mean it's terrible, of course. - I know what you mean. I do. This afternoon, shortly after one o'clock, the First Bank of Toronto at the Eaton Centre was held up... Hey, Freddie, telephone. ...by a fat, bearded man in a red suit... Santa Claus. As he was making his getaway, sudden gunfire erupted, and the bogus Santa Claus shot it out with the bank's security guard, Frank Johnson. When did you first notice something was wrong? Well, as he was leaving Cullen's window, he collided with a woman. I called out to him, but he ignored me when I told him to halt. That's when he started shooting. Did he fire the first shot? Why, yes. Isn't it unusual for a security guard to carry a weapon? Well... ...cash business... restaurant, shop. Does the bank have any policy about when a security guard should use his weapon? Well, exactly how much was stolen? $48,350. $48,350. $48,350. Yes, it is, but as vault teller, I'm in charge of all the money kept on the floor at any one time. Is there any strategy you're supposed to use in the event of a robbery? You know, laid down by the bank. Well, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty... $48,350. $48,350. $48,350. $48,350. Do you think it's safe to assume then, that he was familiar with the bank's operations? Mr. Cullen, do you still believe in Santa Claus? Jesus, friend, you almost killed her. You've gone too far this time, Reikle. They called the cops. Really? - Congratulations on your television debut. - Thank you. Thank heavens you're still here, Mr. Cullen. Don't worry a thing about it. I'd have done the same thing myself. Would you excuse me for a moment? Notice how photogenic our teller is? - I'd like to be relieved at the counter. - Oh? They're lining up to stare at me. Why don't I change places with Julie for a while? What the hell is Simonsen doing out there? And you only want $20 in cash? First Bank of Toronto. Good morning. There you are. "A Hollywood film company is said to be interested, with the bank's photogenic head teller, Miles Cullen, playing the all-important male lead." Excuse me. I need the keys to your file and the card-index drawer. - Which one? - The safety deposit box receipts. - Thanks. - Okay, fine. - How do you want it? - Fives, please. That's one, two, three... You're over here today. You look great on TV. Thank you. I need to get into my safety deposit box. All right. Shall we? Charmed. - This won't take very long. - Take your time. There. - That didn't take very long, did it? - Not at all.

I think it's love. - Hi. - How you doin'? - Hi, Miles. - Hi, Louise. - Julie. - Hi, Julie. - Forgive the gloves. - How are you? - I'm fine, thanks. How are you? - Lovely. - How's it going? - Not bad.

Dear, I'd like you to meet Louise. - How do you do? - Louise, I'm glad you could come. - And Simonsen. - How do you do? - It's nice to see you again. - Thank you. And you know Julie Carver. Merry Christmas. Of course, uh, Cullen. Well, he's here. I'll give you three guesses what we've been talking about. We want to hear the whole story. After which, we promise to drop the subject. What's he going to do with all that lovely money? - Tax free. - Oh, I know what I'd do. Everything. I think everybody should try everything at least once. Everything? Well, within reason. What would you do? After all, you're the one who had his hands on it. I would put it in the bank. Oh, Miles, where's your imagination? Surely there's something you want. - There is. - What? An ocellated puffer. - A what? - A blowfish. There's a really fine specimen down at Ron's Aquarium Shop. Did you mean what you said before about trying everything once? Well, I'm kind of drunk, but, if I said it, I guess I must have meant it. I think your husband is very angry with me, Mrs. Packard. - Vivian. - Vivian. He'll get over it. You know, Charles underestimates you. Are you the type people usually underestimate? We had a wonderful time. Anyone want to smoke a number? - Yeah, you got some? - In my purse. - Oh, I left it in the bathroom. - I'll go. It's upstairs, first door on your left. First door on the left. Don't, uh, mind me. If I don't come back with the grass, they'll just send someone else. So what did you think of her? What did I think of her? Who? Vivian. Vivian. Oh, very nice. She certainly seemed to like you a lot. Hmm. Do you think she knows? I mustn't do over 40. I think she takes it as a matter of course if he should... have his little affairs every now and then. Well, are you in love with him? Yes. No. I don't know. One... One hopes. Otherwise, it's all so pointless. It's a good thing he gave me you to look after me. - Thanks. - I hope you don't mind stairs. We're all the way at the top. Does anyone really know you, Miles? Don't you know me? I thought I knew you, but you've changed. Or I underestimated you. Why are you smiling? Well, that's the second time tonight I've been told I was underestimated. Ah, Vivian. Well, it's true. You've changed. May I consider that a compliment? Yes. Do you know what I meant when I said before... about things being pointless? I think so. Eating, sleeping. drinking, working at the bank. My life is just slipping away. If I don't grab every moment... What would you do with it if you had it? The money, I mean. Well, I'm not sure. But it's not that much, really. I mean, you just couldn't live on it forever, could you? But what would you do? Well... I'd wait a while to make sure nobody suspected me. And then I'd go away somewhere. Far away. I suppose I'd use the money to buy myself another chance. It's just a daydream. A nice daydream. Would there be room in it for two? What is it? You look exceptionally lovely tonight. I think... that must be your imagination. No. I wanted to tell you earlier. But you didn't. Is that something you wanted to do earlier too? That's something I've always wanted to do. We may be taking... advantage. I never thought I'd be doing this with you. Oh. How does it feel? Terrific. Hello? Hello? Think of a number. What? Think of 48,350. You must have the wrong number. Looking for a girl. You're doing it to her like you did it to me. You still have the wrong number! - Persistent, isn't he? - Yes. Good idea. Now, where were we? - What's wrong? - Nothing. Um... We have had quite a bit to drink. I'm not so sure we should be doing this. I don't understand you, Miles. And I'm not sure I want to. Don't move. I know my way. Good night. Did you get her home all right? She's very attractive. Who is this? Now, that's the beautiful part of it, isn't it? I know who you are, but you're in the dark. Well, not totally in the dark. I've left your light on for you. By the way, do you have much luck with those chess problems? Look, um, why don't you come over to the window and open the curtains? And then we can have a look at each other. Go on, open them. If you have something to say to me, say it. Otherwise, I'm hanging up. Oh, no, don't hang up now, pal. I'm running low on dimes, and I'd just have to come up there, that's all. And I don't want to do that, not yet. Now, first, we're gonna try to talk things over. Reasonably. All right? Now come over to the window. That's better. We're friends. You know that? Friends. I mean it. You know, you're kind of remarkable, you know that? I don't know how you managed to pull it off. But I guess you're gonna have to tell me one of these days. But we, uh... we worked it together, didn't we? I mean, we... we ran the same risks, didn't we? We're, uh... - We're partners. - I'm gonna call the police. And what are you gonna tell them? Besides... You see this? Oh, come on. You don't think I'm gonna shoot you from here, do you? I hope you didn't go to any trouble on my account. I'm not gonna break the door down. I'm just gonna give you a little time to try to be reasonable. If you decide you're not gonna be reasonable, then, one night, when you come home, you'll find me on the inside, waiting for you. And that'll be the night you'll wish you'd never been born. Something for Cullen. Cullen. Hello, partner. Get my pretty postcard? Just put it in an envelope and enclose one of the usual deposit slips. There we go, a talent for improvisation. I like that. Of course you can. We're used to it that way. Good-bye. Girlfriend? You get Julie home all right last night? Of course. Why? Just wondering. - Cullen. - Look, you've got my money, and I want it! - Now! - No, sir. We're open the day before Christmas as usual. Good-bye. I'm sorry about the pretty fish. - We've got to meet, you and I. - Meet? Well, yes. We can't go on like this, can we? No, we can't. I'm not letting you sleep on it this time. Shall I come up, or will you come down? Okay, you can come up. It's me. Go fuck yourself. Hey! Hey! He stole my car! I'm calling about an old pal of yours. Who is this? Cut the crap! He's got a gun. He stole a van tonight, a delivery van. It's parked at 611 Winston in Cabbagetown. He's inside, but you better get your ass moving. Hmm. What's his name? Don't worry. You'll recognize him when you see him. He's an old pal, but be careful. He's got the rod on him. Bye. "Rod." Jesus. Come on. Come on! Get your hands off! Do you think I'd be stupid enough to park a van in front of my own... Okay, you just tell us about it downtown. You say you've caught someone? Well, not exactly. They picked up someone we were looking for on another charge. He's kind of a weirdo, but good old-fashioned armed robbery is one of the things he's indulged in in the past. We feel there's a chance he's our man. Now, you'll see five men standing in a row. One of them's our suspect. The question is whether you can recognize our man. Oh, don't worry. They won't be able to see you. Okay? Take your time. Take a good look at each one of them. Number five bore a certain resemblance. Number five and number two. Well, they look just like each other. But it wasn't number two, either. The strange thing is that, even though I'm sure number two isn't the man, I feel as though I've seen that man somewhere before. Mr. Cullen, your powers of observation are very good. You have seen that man before. We showed you a picture of him the last time you were here. Well done, Mr. Cullen. But you're sure he wasn't the one in the bank? - I'm afraid I am. - Well, it was a chance. He's done this kind of thing before. And when we picked him up, he was carrying a gun. You said you'd been looking for him on another charge? Yeah. Beat up and raped a teenager. How'd you find him? A friend of his played a little joke on him. What'll happen to him? Not enough. Would you like to go to dinner? Yes, Miles, I would. But I'm not going to. I don't know why you behaved as you did the other evening. You've chosen not to explain. And I'm choosing not to... repeat the experience. We just work at the same bank. - That's a nice girl. - Yes, she is. - Have a nice Christmas Eve, Mr. Cullen. - Same to you, Frank. - Have a nice night. - Merry Christmas. ...we therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ; who shall change our mortal body that it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself. - Are you all right now? - Yes, thank you. I'm not sure you remember me. Elaine Moreille. I work at the nursing home. I'm not sure I remember. Well, we only met in the doorway once or twice. I work nights. It's very nice of you to have come. I will come alone one day and lay some flowers. Your father was very special. - Can I drop you someplace? - Oh, you mustn't bother. Please, let me drive you. I could use the company. All right. But only to my subway stop. Tell me more about my father. I'm afraid I can't, really. Just that he was a sweet person. Modest somehow. I grew very fond of him. And you know he was very proud of you. Is your job at the nursing home on a permanent basis? It's just a part-time job. - I'm studying. - To be what? I don't know. That's why I like night duty. You see, my time is left pretty much to myself. It was very nice of you to give me a lift. No problem. Put this up here and go to lunch, eh? Oh, Mr. Cullen. What you do here now? Mrs. Evanchuk, I forgot this was your day. I finish a few minutes. What did you do with everything in the refrigerator? What did you say? The refrigerator. What happened? I cleaned it out. Well, what did you do with everything that was in it? It was all old and moldy. - Where is it? - I threw it in the garbage. Oh, my God! I not throw away anything good. Wait! "The subterranean vault will be surrounded by 2,000 cubic yards of impenetrable reinforced concrete. And yet it is an artful building of such grace and beauty that it will stand as a source of civic pride for all times to come." Oh, absolutely. Sounds more like a tombstone to me. Oh, but that sounds so impressive. 2,000 cubic yards of cement. - Hi. - Hello, Miles. How've you been? - Fine. You? - Good. Oh, by the way, a man telephoned when you were at lunch all upset because he'd lost the keys to his safety deposit box. He only had to come to me. You'll both be coming Saturday, won't you? Of course. Good. I'm kinda nervous. Is there any way of getting around the locksmith approach? Hmm? The locksmith, when someone's lost their keys. I call in the locksmith. He opens the box, puts in a new lock. What way around it could there be? Beautiful, isn't it? - Hello. - May I? Please. What brings you here? I often come to walk and get away from things. - And you? - The same. I saw you earlier. But you looked like you wanted to be alone. - Perhaps you still do? - No. Care for a drink? Were you thinking about your father? He used to bring me here. I know. He told me. - He told you? - Yes. You know, I've experienced the same thing. When you lose someone, you want to think about everything you can remember. Do you always carry a bottle? Not always. Do you feel the way I do after a long walk? I always feel like being with someone. When you feel that way, what do you do? Go someplace. - And are the chances good? - One can be lucky. Well, if we both went to the same place, we'd both be certain of being lucky. Was that an invitation? Of course! Of course that was an invitation. Your bill, sir. I trust you enjoyed your meal. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - How old are you? - Twenty-two. - Family? - What's left, back in France. Miles. Yes? It's a stuffy name. I suppose so. It doesn't suit you. I know something about you. - You do? - Uh-huh! I saw you on television. Your father was very proud of you. Proud? Of what? The way you dealt with it. How did it feel? Can you remember? When he stood there pointing his gun at you, what did you feel? Scared. I was afraid. - It must have been exciting. - It was. You were terrific on television. I'm afraid I fell for you completely. It must be late. I should be getting to work. Let me drop you. If you like. But I don't still work at the nursing home. - Oh. - Couldn't take it anymore. Where do you work now? You'll see. ♪ I hear them night birds Singin' at my door ♪ ♪ There go the street flirts The town's a-goin' rogue ♪ ♪ My baby works In the missions... ♪ Freddie's the owner. Turned it into a private club. Who is Freddie? Nobody knows very much about Freddie. Who are the people with Freddie? Friends of Freddie's. Would you like to go to a wedding? Are you proposing? No. Smile! Thanks. - Getting bored? - No. - Hello. - Hello. I don't think you've met. This is Elaine. - Julie. - Lou, Miles. - Hello, Lou. - How are you? Hey, Cullen. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - Are you two going away? - Damn right. We're going to Lake Louise for ten days. It was her parents' idea. How will the bank get along without you? Without both of you. Oh, they'll manage okay with Cullen here. You notice Packard didn't see fit to show up. It was quite an afternoon. And none too soon. We couldn't have kept this a secret too much longer, could we? A little too much Christmas celebration. Now that's something to really drink to. We gotta get going. Have a good time, everybody. Would you care to dance? - She's lovely. - Isn't she? And young, eh? You dirty old man. Is that the one who sent the cute card? No. All the better. Good-bye! Good-bye! What are you thinking? How much I would like to make love with you. - Really? - Yeah. Most people will never say it. - You're an unusual man. - No. Why do you laugh? Nobody ever thought about me like that before. - Maybe you've changed. - Maybe. What do you think about what I'm thinking? You really want to know? Really? Why'd you do that? I like it better in the dark. Well, you unplugged the air pump. The fish might have died. Maybe they'd be better off. You think they like being kept in a glass cage? I don't think they think about it at all. - Doesn't that hurt? - A little. Who are you? What do you mean? Just what I say. Who are you and what do you want from me? I don't understand. I called the nursing home, and they never heard of you. Which means you had no business being at my father's funeral, which means it wasn't just a coincidence our meeting in the park. Now, what do you want? What do you think I want? I have no idea. He telephoned you. You were by the window. He was down in the street. You did not identify him as the one who robbed your bank because you knew he'd talk if you did. But didn't it occur to you that he might send somebody to watch after his interests while he was locked up? Frankly, yes, it did occur to me. He warned me you were smart. We never did figure out how you pulled it off. We? How much does "we" mean? We were enjoying ourselves a little while ago. Well, it isn't so difficult to enjoy yourself. Sometimes it's better if you just like someone. Nothing more than that. Like someone and have a little something in common. - Like money? - Yes. Well, I have all the money. But there is something you want from me. There is? You could have dropped me when you found out I was lying. It would have been easy enough, hmm? You want to tell me about it? Not yet. You fucked us both, didn't you? Yes. You let us think we were getting away with it, and, all the time, you were fucking us. Yes. First him. - And then me. - Yes. I love it. Something wrong? I don't know. Is there supposed to be something wrong? I don't know. You don't know? I feel... there's something you haven't told me. Like what? I don't know. I don't know where the money is. It's too soon. - He doesn't suspect? - Not at all. I'm the nice girl who used to take care of his father. I think he likes me. And you? I like you. You'll see him again? - When? - All the time. Tonight. He will tell me soon. I know he will. Yeah. Okay. Get out. He's good at it. Isn't he? Not like you. Nobody's like you. Your relief's here. 1:30 already? Miles, why don't we have lunch together? I'd better look after things here. Nothing's happening. - We could talk. - I better stay here, really. Okay. - There you go. - Thank you. Excuse me. I have a problem. Oh, come in and sit down. I don't know where to start. I'm so embarrassed. Just relax and keep your back to Berg as much as possible. She's the one I'm worried about. She really looked me over at that wedding. Julie won't be back until 2:30. Now you can take the receipt out of your bag. Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure? I've looked everywhere. You realize we will have to call in a locksmith. Stop smiling. I'm sorry. A locksmith? Can't you just open the box? It takes both keys... the bank's and yours. The locksmith will open it up, and then he'll put in a new lock. I'd like to help her get into her box, eh? How silly I've been. I'm terribly ashamed. Excuse me. This is our bank manager, Mr. Packard. Ms. Hartman. I'm afraid she's lost the keys to her safe deposit box. - Both of them? - They were hidden in the same place. - Well, the box receipt's in her name only? - Yes. Pardon me, but we've had wives try that a couple of times. I am not a wife. Uh, the receipt's in her name, and the signature tallies. I've already checked her driver's license. Well, what time is Julie back from lunch? 2:30. Maybe you should take the time to have one more look for the keys. No. I'm sorry, but it's very important I get the box open. There are letters inside. Personal letters. I see. I need to have access to them for... personal reasons. Go ahead, call the locksmith. I think he's over on Queen Street. This won't take very long. So I'll send my first payment in on the 15th. If you'll just fill this out. - Thank you very much. - Good luck. - Where the hell is he? - Should we forget it? I could just go. - Damn it! Busy. - He keeps staring at me. I'll try again. Mr. Pearlman! Sorry. Some customers came in. I got held up. - Hello. - Oh, hello. - Lost your keys, huh? - I'm so embarrassed. Oh, don't be. That's why we're in business, isn't it? This one right over here, 135. - 135, huh? - 135, yes. - Do you have the bank's key? - Yes. Voilà! It'll only take me a minute now. I will just make sure that everything's here. - Get it open all right? - Yep. Good. There. I told you we'd take good care of you now, didn't I? Yes, you did. Are those the letters? Silly, isn't it? He'll put the new lock in, then he'll give you your key. I presume you will want to be returning your valuables to your safe deposit box. You will want to return your valuables to your box, won't you? Don't you trust me? We made an agreement. Oh, so you are returning your valuables to your safe deposit box. Yes. - All set? - Yep. Thank you. Mrs. Hartman. - I trust you. - Great. Now get the hell out of here. - All right? Make copies. - Right. I haven't seen you in here before, have I? I only come in now and again to put something in my box. Excuse me. Well, we are a very friendly bank. Julie. Julie, I have to talk to you. - What is it? - It's us, Julie, you and me. Us? What about us? We have to grab each moment as it comes. Isn't that what you said? - What's got into you? - We've gotta stop kidding ourselves. There's more going on between us than we've admitted, even to ourselves. Well, even supposing that's true, what are we gonna do about it? Well, we... we grab each moment and we make it count. Miles. I'm sorry. I'm not. Can we talk tonight? Oh, uh, well, I can't tonight, Julie. I'm... But soon. How soon? Julie, you should be getting back. They're, uh, starting to wonder. I don't believe you. Can I call you? I don't know. I don't know anything. I really don't. To success. Our success. And now? I find myself doing things I never would have dreamed I was capable of. Aren't you forgetting something, someone? Not for a minute. When he gets out, I'll make a deal. What kind of a deal? We'll split the money, the three of us. On one condition... that we never hear from him again, either of us. You're sweet, Cullen, but you're so naive. He's going to take the money, all of it. And then he's gonna kill you just for fun. And he'll laugh while he's doing it. And then he's gonna kill me too when he finds out. - You keep saying "kill." - He's done it before. Twice. You see, it's not a game with him. Then what made you? I mean, if you're so afraid of him... - Why would I go with you? - Yes. I guess... I want to change. Well, you could go away. No. I will see it through with you. You've outsmarted him twice. Maybe you'll do it again. And then I'll go away if you still want me to. Is it her... Julie? - What's that for? - I want you to have it. - I trust you. - I know you do. I just want you to have it. You'll know where it is. This way, you can come and get it anytime you want. And there's something else. I've decided to get rid of my aquarium. No, I want you to keep it. Why? Because every time you look at those fish, you'll think of me, hmm? Excuse me a minute. I'm going to freshen up. Hey. What's the matter? You're not glad to see me? Of course. But... how... How did I, uh... Oh, just like that. Magic. Freddie worked on the girl... got her to drop the charge... to say she lied. But why did Freddie... didn't tell me? And why didn't you? Oh, I don't know. I suppose I... thought it might be better to surprise you. - Another bottle, sir? - No, not yet. That bastard. I should've killed that prick a long time ago. There's a chance I'll look forward to that even more than that goddamn money! He's gonna get a surprise when he comes through that door. Well, what are you waiting for? I won't do it. I can't go on with this. Why? Because I'm through with you now. My life has changed. You've had it with him right here, haven't you? Yes. Right here. We made love for the first time... here on the floor. - How was it? - Very nice, actually. I'm finished with you. I've had it! Finished with me? But I'm not finished with you! I knew it. I knew it. It's him, isn't it? It's him! That bastard! First the money and now you! He is part of it, but mostly it's you and me. You know, don't you? You know where the money is and you won't tell me, you bitch! You won't fuck me! You won't tell me! Damn it. Hello? Hello? Now... we've each had our little joke... at the other's expense. Where are you? Goddamn it! Where are you? Listen to me, you fucking bastard, I'm gonna kill you. So help me God, I'm gonna kill you. Miles. Is that you? What... What is it? Are you all right? What's happened? Julie, I thought it was somebody else. My aquarium... somebody pulled the plug out. The pump wasn't on. Are the fish all right? Oh, yes. They're dead. Oh, my God. Miles, I'm so sorry. That's all right. They're better off. - You don't mean that. - Yes, I do. If they could have their choice, they'd prefer it the way it is rather than to go on the way they had been. Julie, can I talk to you tomorrow? Sure. Goddamn asshole. You're clever, pal. There's no doubt about it. You're clever. I mean, even if they knew she was down there... they'd never get her out from under that foundation. - Vault. - What? It's a subterranean vault surrounded by 2,000 cubic yards of reinforced concrete. Huh. Yeah, you're clever, all right. There's no doubt about that. What's the matter? You hurt your leg? That's too bad. Things were going pretty much in your direction, I guess. But, uh, guess things have changed, haven't they? First the girl, now your leg. That's too bad. I feel as though I know you very well. Then you know I'm ready to kill you. Yeah. I want the money, all of it, and no bullshit. How do I know you won't kill me anyway? You don't. You're still one up on this little game of yours. It's not a game anymore! You're damn right it isn't, and it never was. Why? All she had to do was tell me where the money was, and you'd be dead instead of her. The money is at the bank. - The bank. - It's in a safety deposit box. The bank. Well, you get it. You get it and have it at your apartment tonight. Oh, no. Not that way. It'll be at the bank at my counter. Aw, come on, pal, you're not stupid. You know I can't go back to the bank. Somebody might recognize me. If you dress up like Santa Claus. I'm not meeting you alone. How soon can you have it at your window? As soon as the bank opens, but don't come in then. Wait an hour or two until the bank's not so crowded. And I want you to know one thing. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you. Oh, hey. Hey, pal, you know... That's no way to talk. You know that. We're partners. You know that. First the robbery, now the murder. We're partners. We always have been. She knew, didn't she? I mean, she knew all the time where the money was, didn't she? Yes, she knew! She even had the keys to the safety deposit box. - Pleasant trip, Louise? - Oh, yes, we had such... - Would you excuse us for a minute? - What? - I have to get into my safety deposit box. - But... Thank you very much. I didn't know you had a box. Looking a little ragged today, aren't we, Cullen? You know, lately, Cullen, I've been wondering about your attitude, your attitude toward banking, your attitude toward your coworkers. I don't think I need to remind you of the tremendous responsibility we have. There is nothing more important than banking, and our attitude must reflect that attitude. We're the ones who handle the money. There's nothing more important than that. Julie. - What's wrong? - Wrong? Why would anything be wrong? Things have kind of come to a head lately, but, then again, I have been wanting to leave the world of banking for some time now. - Miles. - I'll find a new place. - Someplace where I can... - Miles. What are you talking about? I'm leaving. You're leaving? I was wondering... I was wondering if... Go on. ...you would go with me? - What? - I want you to go with me, Julie. - Are you kidding? - Come with me, Julie. - Good morning. - Good morning. - People are here. - Shall I go? Good morning, Miles. Mrs. Skinner. - Mr. Donaldson. - How do you do? - Thank you. - Thank you. Can I have change for a 50, please? - Would you like singles? - That's fine, thanks. Thanks very much. You should have waited until later when there were fewer people in the bank. Give it to me. What are you waiting for? Give it to me. Take it easy. Give it to me. Anybody looking? - It's all there. - It better be. Oh, and Cullen? I'll be seeing you one of these days. What do you mean? Guess. - What's that? - That's your interest. Go ahead. Go ahead. Do you think the printing looks like yours? I did it all from memory. We couldn't just leave it there, could we? Don't shoot! Please, don't shoot! Please, please! Don't shoot. Frank, be careful. He's got a gun. - Please, please! - Shut up. Shut up. He's got a gun! Watch out! - That fella's hit. - He's still got a gun. - Look out! - He's got a gun! All right. Stop right there. - Are you all right? - What happened to him? - Frank shot him. - Is he dead? - I don't know. - Why aren't the police here? My God. What? He gave it... to me. He gave me... the bank... the bank's... money. What the hell did you expect him to give ya, his own money? Help me! Get an ambulance. Get a doctor or something. $2,821. Not much to die for. Lieutenant, look at this. Yeah. "I have a gun. Put all the cash in the bag." Like last time, only a different disguise. Who says lightning doesn't strike twice? I guess the poor bastard thought it was his lucky bank. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait. Where is she? No, wait. Wait... Wait a second. Where is she? No, wait. Don't take me away yet. Where is she? I always wondered what it felt like to be shot. It hurts a lot. He could have killed you. Why did you do it? Well, I'll tell you all about it sometime. Sometime when? When I get to know you better. That's going to be sooner than you think. You better not. Miles. I have something for you. And that's not all. You looked inside? You remember that daydream? Yes. So do I. Well... that means... from now on... Oh, yes, from now on.
