[thunders rumbling] In a wrong season, that too continuously before Ugadi I don't understand how it is raining so much Minister. Don't know how many more days this would continue. A woman with her infant came to meet the king. She needs to see our king at once it seems. Let her in. [thunders rumbling] Kids shout: Mom! It's nothing son. Mallika, take them to their room. Who are you? What help do you seek that you have come in this weather? I came here for my husband who gave birth to this child. You look like goddess Lakshmi in human form. Tell me who is that betrayer? The king will punish him and do justice to you. It's the King Jai Chandra. King! King! After so long I see you! I came here running after waiting for your arrival for a long time. Here is your boon to me! What is this non-sense? Who gave you this right? Be careful you are crossing your limits! Why are you silent, king? Talk to your son who shares your blood, for once. Who are you? King! You are asking me who I am? It's me! Vasundhara. In the presence of the trees and lakes, in the presence of the five elements, you've married me and promised me you would take me home soon. I am the same Vasundhara. She commited a mistake blinded by lust, Blaming the king for her sin, she plotted to become the queen and make her son the heir to the throne. Put this cunning lady in prison! Stop! [chuckles] She is in a state of madness that she doesn't know what she is talking. Let her go. Stop! If seeking justice is madness, then breaking a promise is utter madness. Even if you don't agree, that won't change the truth. I didn't come here dreaming that he should become a king... ...and rule the kingdom or me being your queen sharing the throne. But, wherever my son might be and in which situation he might be, I'll prove that he will rule the entire world with his own strength. Time will prove the truth in my words. Goodbye! [infant crying] [thunders rumbling] Vasundhara! [infant crying] [horse neighing] [infant crying] [horse neighing] Vasundhara! [infant crying] Ah! Son! [infant crying] Son! Son! Ah! [birds chirping] Master! Master! Some woman came down in the river [birds chirping] My son! [panting] Where is my infant? How did I reach here? You are in the Ashram of the Jamadagni, the great sage. Hermit! Hermit! Hermit, you are my only hope. Please see that I get my infant son back. Look, she is goddess Vajreshwari Devi, She is the one who saves our Ashram and this area and the one who gives us self-confidence and power. Oh saviour goddess! Where is my son? In which situation he is? I'll go search for him. Please show me the way goddess. [sobs] Don't be emotional child. How and where can you search for your son? Just wait keeping your trust on the goddess. The goddess will show you the way when the time comes. Why do I need this life if my son is not alive hermit? Please allow me, I'll go in search of my son. If I can't find him I'll go disappeared. Don't lose your courage child See this? This is the sign of your son. Your son is very much alive. Is it hermit? As long as this flower is blooming, your son will be safe wherever he is. [human calls] [horses neighing] Tribal head! We found a child in the river! We found a child in the river! [horse neighs] [indistinctive chatter] [horse neighs] Tribal queen, look he is the child we found in the river. He was smiling in the basket while the river carried him here. The god has given him to the river and the river gave him to us. Today is Ugadi festival. It's a good omen as this child has come to us on this festive day. -What do you say hubby? -Yes, my wife. We will raise him and get him trained in stick fight and sword fighting. That's okay. We will make him educate under a good teacher... ...so that he doesn't speak our langauge and style. As he has come to our house on the day of festival, I'll name him as Vijay. The name Vijay is very good. Crowd: Hail for Vijay! Crowd: Hail for Vijay! [horse neighs] [shouts] [horse neighs] [laughs] [people shouting] [shouts] [laughing] What's this? Horse is moving backwards! Vijay, I am coming you don't be affraid. Catch the Horse without any fear. That is a wild Horse, is it possible for them to catch it? It might be a wild Horse or mountain Horse, if our Vijay wants to, he will catch it in a jiffy! [horse neighs] [indistinctive voices] Crowd: Throw it! [horse neighs] Vijay, catch it! Catch it! [horse neighs] Catch it! Vijay, catch it! Come on, Vijay! Come on, throw! You should rotate the rope and throw around it's neck man. -Hey! Yeah! -Idiot! I didn't mean to throw it on me. [shouts] [horse neighs] [groans] [groans] [horse neighs] Ah! [groans] -Throw it! -Throw it! [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [groans] [horse neighs] [crowd cheering] How's it? How's it? [cheering] Vijay has caught it! He has caught it! [horse neighs] [cow moos] [horse neighs] Vijay has caught the wild Horse. [indistinctive voices] [indistinctive voices] [cow moos] Stop Vijay! Vijay stop there. What are these adventures? [laughs] You won't stop how much ever I say! Shut up! Are you telling him not to do adventures? Vijay, it's only you who could tame a wild Horse. You have proved it again that there is no one great than you in our village. All the credit goes to you father. You and mother raised me in that way. Then what about me? As they have given birth and raised you. You are greater than me! [laughs] Alright Vijay, make a wish in this happy moment I'll make it true. Wish? What wishes do I have? Make a wish, why are you saying no when your father is asking? Father, 'What you said is nice, and whatever I'm going to say it awesome" do you want me to make you say this? -Say it man! -Say it! You only wish for something. My wish is to fulfill your wish. How is it! How is it! [chuckles] He is very smart. Then I'll make a wish listen. -If you go towards the North-East -Ok... They say there is a big forest. And they say in that forest, lies a Water Tree! -Water Tree? -Yes. They say if you cut the branch of that tree, water comes out. If we drink that water, old age will turn into young -If you can bring those water... -What? Will you marry two more women and roam around after drinking that water? Let him marry mother... our village would grow and grow! [groans] Alright we will start right now. Let's go big brother! -Come on! -Wait! Wait! -Are you really going? -Yes. Then would it be good if he becomes young and I stay old? Please bring some water for me too. -Okay, we will bring. -We will bring. -We will bring. -Come on big brother. -Who else need Youth water? -Crowd: Me! Me! [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [horses neighing] [horses neighing] [horses neighing] How is it? How is it? Brother Pandu, did you see? Strange thing that we don't see in this surroundings. We can see colorful flowers only here. I think the water plant should be nearby. Yes, yes. [horse snortles] [horse neighs] [grunts] -Careful... Hold me! Yeah! [grunts] [grunts] Vijay! This is no Water Tree! this is some wild tree. [water burbling] I can hear water burbling sound from here. Vijay, water inside is burbling. [water burbling] This is the Water Tree! How is it? How is it? Water Tree... Water Tree! [laughs] Water Tree... Water Tree! Water Tree... Water Tree! [laughs] [grunts] Youth water... youth water! -Hey, move! -Oh no! I turned young... I turned young. Vijay, look whether this tree has seed, we will sow it in our land.

[horses neighing] [laughs] It's a happy news! In this king of Kartikeya province, Brahmananda Bhupati's garden A normal person has entered. It's a surprising news. He appreciated our princess Padmavati Devi by watching her dance. It's a good news. Not only that, he also spoke with her. It's so entertaining. -It's not like that king. -Shut your mouth! Don't you know even the bumblebees aren't allowed in the garden? He has come... then don't you know to catch him and bring him to me? Without catching him you are saying that you lost to him shamelessly? It's a shame on us. What are you doing Surya Varma? Isn't this shame for you that you are holding the leadership of total army. Should my brother go even to save the girl? Question them why they are here and what they were doing Hmm... By the way who is he? He looks like a courageous hero father. He has shown his prowess in sword fighting. Our soilders lost to him! -Oh! That means he is a sword fighter! -Yes. -How did he come? -He has come on a horse, king. I am not asking whether he came on a horse or on an slephant. I am asking in which way he has come inside? Why are you asking that hubby? Tell them that no one should enter here after. If they do, tell them to tie their hands and legs and throw in front of you. Did you hear the queen's orders? Tell me if you cannot do this, I'll restrict the girls from entering the garden. Father! [chuckles] Dear, I will only come to protect you. Is it okay dear? What is this? I can't see anything. I didn't get my sight back! Not leaving any stone unturned, we used all medicines We've done all treatments king. -But... -Yes... What could you do? The sin I have commited has punished me this way. -You have commited sins? -Why didn't you te us before? We've spent lakhs unnecessarily! -What do you say brother South? -Yes, brother North. -So, patriarch. -That means a father. -Until you expire. -Take rest. We will rule this kingdom. You villains! Since your mother passed away, I raised you in a pampering manner... -You didn't raise us. -We grew on our own. -So we will only rule. -Yeah! Fool! You want to rule the kingdom? Why can't we? Even the Cow's, Buffalo's also rule for some time. But you are ruling even at this age. Then when we will rule? -See father. -Pity, he can't see North. -Oh! Then listen to me father. -Yes. From now we will sit on the throne. That means sit on it. -Brother, -Yes? -We have only one throne right? -Yes. How can we both rule on it? Break the throne into two man! Break it! -Yeah! -Yeah! -We will break it into pieces -Then we will rule on those pieces. -We'll rule and soothe. -Soothe and show you. [laughs] Oh no! It's all my fate! My fate!

You are sleeping like this only. If you feel sleepy then sleep. [chuckles] I am not feeling sleepy, the I closed my eyes. Shh! Don't make noise. Stay quiet if it's not possible to you like the other day. Would you be brave and go to war? Would you act valiant and get into risk? If you dare make the princess fall in love with you. You have mustache on your face and courage on your nose. We have horses to travel. -and we have wall to jump. -Come. Hey, Vijay where are you going? Whatever it takes I should see my princess. What's that? What's that? Would I fall short after compelling you. [horse neighs] Shouldn't I see my Madanika? Vijay, wait am also coming. "Why isn't the fire put off even in cool moonlight and blooming flowers?" "Tell me what's the matter dear girl!" "Why don't you be normal even after applying sandal and serving you?" "Accept the truth dear girl!" "Is it that you don't have a pair?" "This despair of yours..." "Is this despair of yours because you don't have a pair?"

"How strange is the bond of love!" "What a strange love!" "Or is it the chant of cupid!" A singer in the ladies room at this midnight, Who are you man? He is the one king, who did sword fight entering the Vasanta Garden. Great! Is that you? Are you into the art of singing too? [laughs] King, can't the person who's into the royal ladies room, be into singing? Oh! Why do you praise him hubby? What Padma, when he was singing and dancing entering into your room you would have called us or you would have called the soilders. What were you doing? Were you sleeping? No, queen they were awake. They were guarding her without closing their eyes. It's me who jumped the wall and came inside. Ah! Can a normal person easily climb the castle wall and come? First call the person who has built that wall. -We'll punish him. -Oh no! We don't know whether he is alive or dead and you are asking him to be punished. First punish him. [laughs] 'What you said is nice, and whatever I'm going to say it awesome" should I make you say this queen? How proudly are you talking! I'll torture you! [sword swishes] [swords swishing] Ah! [swords clinking] [swords swishing] Ah! Ah! [groans] [shouts] Ah! [chuckles] [gasps] [chuckles] Princess I am a prisoner to you, but not to those soilders. Coming Friday we will meet in the same place. [laughs] [chuckles] What cheeks! -Hey! Hey! -Let's return in the same way. -My Madanika! Madanika! -No Madanika nothing, come on. Padma! What is your childish behaviour and signals? Who is he and who are you? Do you romance with him? If want to play, play with your sister it's happiness. But why you are playing with that youngster dear? That is why I am asking you since many days, that you have to get her married but you aren't listening. That is why prospective grooms are coming to see her. -Prospective grooms? -Yes. King of the Chandra Prabha province Jaya Chandra Pratap and me, when we met in a marriage I gave a word that I'll get my daughter married to their prince. As per my word I invited them for matches, princes are coming. What is this sister? Brother-in-law is talking about some other princes, when I am present. Brother would I let any other person marry Padmavathi? Why do you worry? Leave it to me. King, they have cut the throne into two pieces as you said. Sitting one on each piece they are doing atrocities on the name of public rule. They are torturing public and extracting taxes for each and everthing king. Are they extracting taxes? Are they any dentists to extract? It's a crime carrying the official matters here. And this blind king listening to that is a big crime. You both being in the palace is a pain in the head to us That means headache. Soldiers keep the Minister in the jail and lock him up. Not this lock! Leave me! Leave me! What is this atrocity? King! What is this horrible deed? You dare punish the minister? Father you have a punishment too! We banish you to forest. That means we will leave you in a forest. -By the way brother. -Yes, brother? As our father is blind right? If we leave him in a forest he might get hurt by the trees and branches. Then we will leave him in a desert. [chuckles] You morons! You would be damned. It's a very big sin to punish your father. Don't talk about sins as we are going on a good work. We got an invitation from the Karthikeya province. Marriage sight with the princess. That means match making. Before we leave, we want to take blessings from you. That means we will bow to you. Damn! Stupids! Both: Ah! Soldiers take him. Hey, leave me man! Leave me. Why are you listening to those stupids? Leave me man! Yes, Princes are coming from Chandra Prabha province to see the princess. Oh no! Did we sit here to listen to this all the while? Vijay, your problem isn't easy to solve We both will get married. -Come. -Hey, wait! Madanika, did you see Chandra Prabha Princes anytime? No, even our king doesn't know them! He saw him in their childhood it seems. Dear Padma, what's the delay? We don't have time. Chandra Prabha Princes are coming for the match making. If you don't wear this jewelry and dresses fast... Father I don't like it. You should have told me once before you invite them. Yes, I should have told you. But I didn't. It's true. I'll ask you one thing, will you get me into a marriage that I don't like? I'll never do that. But this is just match making! When I don't like to get married then what's the use of match making. Yes, it's true. Look dear, as I have given a word to the king Chandra Prabha, I invited princes for match making. They are coming. If we announce that we have cancelled the match making without any proper reason, it's very bad to our status and honor dear. No, let the match making happen, I'll send them saying that princess didn't like you. Do you think it is honor to make them come here and raise hopes? Do you feel that all of this is important? Tell me. Tell me father. It's confusing. King, Chandra Prabha Princes has arrived. Ah! Have they come? Have they come here? Err... make them sit there it self. No! No! Let them inside. It's confusing. [chuckles] Tonnes of greetings. to the king of Kartikeya. Bless you. Greetings to the king. He is my brother, he believes that villages are most important assets of the country, and the rural language is the national language. Making in-depth research on that language... Even when he knows forteen languages, he speaks pure rural language. [laughs] Oh great! What a love towards his language. Please take your seats. [laughs] How is my childhood friend Chandra Prabha? Yes, he is very much happy. Heck does a king in a kingdom have a problem with! If you could call princess for the match making... It would take time for princess to come. As women love to dress up, right? Then call her maid. [chuckles] It's nothing like that, my brother's desire is that he could get to learn any language from them. [laughs] I think it would take time to my daughter to come. Will you take rest in the guest room? Nothing to worry, we will wait even if it take a lot of time. I think the inauspicious time might kick in if it's late. Let it rain, we will see your daughter after that. [laughs] King, Chandra Prabha Princes are coming. Both: Greetings to the king of Kartikeya province. -Who are you? -We are the Chandra Prabha Princes. -Wedding grooms. -That means bride grooms. We have come as we've got your invitation. No, we've come on a cart. Then who are you? -We are the Chandra Prabha Princes. -Yes. They look like frauds who are impersonating us! Both: Huh! Both: Are we frauds? King! Are you The King of Kartikeya province? Yes! Then we are the Chandra Prabha Princes. This is a big problem, we should know who the fraud is and who is true. Till then there is no match making Kartikeya King, make the marriage looks fast That means match making Till we get to know who is real princes, There won't be any match making King, Chandra Prabha Princes are very intelligent. Mistake! They are very intelligent. That means very intelligent fellows. Then we will ask you few questions, -tell the answers. -Say the answers. -Oh -That means ask. Brother ask them. Then answer dudes! Once upon a time there was a forest, there was a palenquin in the forest and a person was going in that palenquin. You have to rob that person. How? How? How? -Shall I answer? -Yes. "Bear the Palenquin! Bear the Palenquin!" Call the Palenquin bearers We will hide beside the way, jump on it. We will hit those bearers and throw them out. We will pull that person out and steal the money he has. -How is it? -Very nice... Another question... Ask them, ask them. There is money in the King's palace. -Does he have? -Yes, he has. You should rob it. How would you rob? Tell me dudes! -We will throw ropes on the walls. -And we will climb up. -We will enter inside. -We will enter the treasury -We'll tie the security. -Then we will rob the money. Great! They are saying it correctly. Last question... Princess is sitting alone in the garden and you should kidnapp her. How will you do? Ah! What's that question? You wait king, we will answer it. We will pour chilly powder into eyes of soldiers. We'll keep cloth in the mouth of the princess. And we will escape with her on our shoulder. That's it. Yeah! As everything they've said are done by thieves, as only the thieves would know them, these are the thieves! Both: Oh no! -King. -We only answered the questions. -We are not thieves. -What do you mean by that? King when we were asking those questions, they should have said 'We are princes! How could we know?' but when they are saying how the thefts are exactly committed... are they princes or thieves? King it's been proved that they are thieves, we will catch them and punish them. If we punish them, they will force me to bring my daughter, but my daughter wouldn't come. so... We will tell both the parties to rest for today! King! If you still doubt... please call the princess once. She will definitely marry me. Even if you call her maid, she would tell you! Why? You take rest in different rooms, everything will be proved. -Vijay, damn! -Yes? I can see only soldiers wherever I go, but I can't see my Madanika. Then how could you see your princess? It's waste that we have change our attires. Come on let's go. Greetings. King has sent fruits and snacks for you. Eh! Oh my Madanika! You are here! -Damn! -Jasmine flower it's me. -Your... -Ah? Yes, look who he is. [laughs] Madanika, I have to meet Padmavati. Then I'll go inform her right now. No, without saying that I have come... -You want it to be fun? -That's what. [laughs] Madanika! Madanika! After saying this to her, you come here quickly. We will have fun here. What cheeks? They are like jasmine buds. [laughs] Both: Princess! Both:Princess! What? What's the nuisance? What happened? Nothing madam, Chandra Prabha prince is coming to see you. Here? You are only welcoming him cordially? Get lost! Not us madam, the king sent him himself It's with his permission, he is coming. Oh! Ok, let him inside. By seeing this appearance and behaviour he will marry me. Greeting princess. May you wed soon! To the Princess of Kartikeya province Ms. Padmavati Chandra Prabha Prince's greetings for this meeting! Ah? Silence? Silence is half acceptance. Aren't you my would-be better half!? Oh! The Chandra Prabha Prince is quite a poet! Happy to know that! But entering into the princess room without her permission, you not knowing that is quite sad! To the one who has entered your heart, would he require permission to enter this room? Ah? Pity, the prince is in the hall of hallucination! It's not hallucination princess. See me placing a hand on your heart You will know how safely I am inside your heart. Enough! Now please leave. Neither would this match making progress, nor this wedding would take place [laughs] Princess 'What you said is nice..." and whatever I'm going to say it awesome" Do I make you say this Princess? Vijay! [laughs] Vijay! How did you come here? [laughs] Few ways and few appearences are mandatory to meet the Madame! Now I am the prince of Chandra Prabha kingdom. The Bride Groom! If someone sees you or finds out who you are... Everyone saw me, -Is it? -Hmm... even they spoke to me. [chuckles] When I asked that I want to talk to you they've shown me the way. You aren't aware how dangerous such an adventure is in this palace. Come, this side. [laughs] When there is a love filled flower garden when there is the moonlight which spreads romance When there are those princes who came for you... don't you want to enjoy that fun Princess Padmavathi? [laughs] Brother! Brother! Brother South! Yes, brother North? The men who claim to be the Chandra Prabha Princes, Yes, they came -They claimed that we are thieves... -Yes. They are real thieves. Yes, their beard is not real you know? That means they've kept fake beards. -It's true. -Is it? It's as true as we don't have beards. Then we should immediaitly inform this to the king. -Yes, we should. -Come on, brother North. -Come on. -This way. Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Come down! Come! You can't enter without permission and you wouldn't get permission without entering. What is this confusion man? This is the ritual of this kingdom. Come on. By the way, what do you want? We want to tell the king that the ones who called us thieves are the real thieves But it's you who look like thieves! Why would we be like that? We are the wedding grooms. -What? -We are Bride Grooms. At the same time, two more persons... Arrived with fake beards and are cheating the king. How do you know that their beards are fake? Did you go to shave them? -Hey, mind your words. -Do you know who we are? Show me how do you know that their beards are fake? First there was beard, then there was no beard, again there was beard. Both: Yes. -I think you have an eye problem! -It's for my dad. It's not a contigious disease and won't spread to us. Okay. First show me that their beards aren't real, once I believe it, you can tell the king. -Is this the ritual of the kingdom too? -Yes. Do you know what's the punishment if you can't prove? Both: What's that? Slash! [gasps] -Brother North! -Still needn't fear... We will prove it. "An incident of deep love and an excellent act put up" "Both suited well!"

I should ask this right? -Ask her brother-in-law. Ask her how can that forest man come into the palace after I set so much security! Oh I should ask this too right? Padma, what is this dear? Forgive me father. I can't hide my feelings once the matter came so far I am in love with Vijay. I want to marry him. Did you see? Did you see her arrogence? Look how she is talking? That is why I told you, to get her married with my brother. Did you care for my words? Did you? -I do care now! -Then fix the dates immediately! Why she is asking me to fix the dates? Dates should be fixed by the priest! Huh! [wolves howling] [wind whistling] [wolves howling] King what are those screams? I think wolves are howling. Why would the wolves howl near the palace? This looks like a bad omen to me I am afraid. [elephant trumpets] [chaos] [elephant trumpets] What's this horrible happening Minister? How did the royal elephant break out suddenly? Suddenly wolves were howling in the night. When we were afraid of that bad omen! -this Elephant resorted to destruction. -You and your superstitions sis! Wolves, Elephants and bad omen.... Surya Varma! Your feelings are modern. You won't understand this omens and evil now. Leave it. I am afraid what and how would be the results... No need to be afraid queen. If we conduct prayers and Yagas in temples, these bad omens would fade out Then start the prayers in every temple. Conduct Yagas! As you say king. [ghostly calls] [ghostly howls] [satanic chants] [satanic chants continue] [ghostly howls] [satanic chants] [satanic chants] [satanic chants continue] [wolf howls] [satanic chants continue] [casts satanic spell] [wind howling] [dishes clanking] [dishes clanking] [satanic chants] [satanic chants continue] Lucky girl to be offered... get up. You should serve the great goddess with a clean heart, come. [satanic chants] Oh golden coloured eternal beauty! You've come from a long distance. Your heart should get pure. You should go around the holy flames Princess, with a clean heart, having no other thoughts you should see the great goddess You should pray with the ashes with devotion [satanic chants] Oh mother! Oh giver of all powers! I've prayed to you since many years You've blessed me with a lot of powers To get all the powers and to be the lord of the universe I've summoned this unmarried beauty as per your command Born during the dawn of the Pisces zodiac, and under the Revathi star, I'm making this princess pray to you on this full moon day. I'll call her on the next full moon day again, and will offer you her blood. Prayers on this silver moon sacrifice on the next full moon! [eagle squeals] Oh beauty with honey filled round eyes! Speak sensing my feelings. Mother, I'll come agian on the next full moon day, I'll dance along with prayers And will offer you my blood [chants] You should reach your place before the moon vanishes And you should be ready to come on the next full moon day. Hmm! [satanic chants] [satanic chants continue] [satanic chants continue] [laughing] Oh keeper of all the satans, ghosts, demons and evil animals! Oh great goddess! Now all the worlds would be under me! The five elements and the animals will have to follow my orders. I'm the king! I'm the lord of all the worlds! [laughs loudly] [screams] -Princess! -Princess! -What happened? -What happened? Mother! Father! Mother! -Padma! -Mother! What happened dear? -Tell me dear. -Tell me dear. Mother... last night... Someone took me some where. What someone took you somewhere? Last night from the palace? It might be a bad dream dear. -It's not real. -That is... It's a reality like dream and a dream like reality. Tell me what actually happened dear. Tell me dear. A dangerous shape... it's a different place. In that place there is fire... I can't tell it properly. I can't remember properly. There is some big statue. Very dangerous... Both: Dear... -Padma! -Padma! Doctor, what have you decided? Her health is alright king. No sign of fever. Pulse rate and blood flow is also fine. Except she might have gone unconcious because of fear, but there is no sign of disease. Can you assume what actually happened? Black magic and witch crafts do work on humans, my king. If something happened to her as she explained... Why has the one doing the black magic choose only our daughter? Who he is? I can't understand anything. I understood brother-in-law, the reason is... the one who is coming secrectly and torturing us trapping Padma, that forest man Vijay. Only the persons who roam around the forests would know such black magic. Then why think Soora Varma? Wherever he is, imprison him and bring him here. [horse neighs] [sheeps bleating] [horse neighs] [swords clinking] Hey, oldie where is the fraud Vijay? What's your work with my son? Your son? Then tell me where is he? He is not here and I don't know. Don't you know? [shouts] -No! -Hey! Please leave him! Leave him. [bash] [chaos] [horse neighs] Hey! [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [cheering] [sheeps bleat] [horse neighs] [sheeps bleat] [horse neighs] [infant crying] [gasps] Oh no! I am coming wait. Oh no! I am coming wait. [cow moos] Wait, I am coming. Wait, I am coming. [horse neighs] [infant crying] Vijay! Vijay! Ah! [shouts] [horse neighs] [laughs] Take him. [groans] [groans] Say it atleast now, what conspiracy have you spun on our princess? I am saying it again I don't understand anything. You won't, you will have to face the whip lashes until you say the truth Huh! [groans] [chains rattling] You aren't telling the truth even after getting beaten black and blue Now tell me, who are you? What is your real form? What are you planning to do by taking my one and only daughter? Tell me man! I don't have a habit of saying different things to diiferent people king. I'm saying the same thing now too. I can't understand what is my crime You are casting your black magic on my daughter, for what you are doing? Black magic and me? On the princess who I love with my whole heart, am I performing black magic? Loving with your whole heart? [chuckles] Why are you acting that you are in love with that innocent? We know why are you trying to trap her. What's your plan and your betrayal is, princess Padmavathi has told us everything. -Padmavathi? -Yes. You came on the night of full moon day, and took her to some dangerous place by spreading sleeping gas... What did you say? Padmavathi who loves me more than anything in this world will never say that Not even for fun! King, I know Padmavathi's heart. To make me hate Padmavathi, they are cooking up stories and blaming me! King! Without wasting time with your vague talks put him in prison. Prison is not enough for him, he should be hanged. Just give me the permission, I'll make it happen immideately. Don't make haste king! Our problem would not be solved if we hang him We should know the people behind him and their aim. Then we should destroy them completely. It's true Minister. But this isn't the right time for that. It's important how to save my daughter's life first. At least tell me the truth now, what's my daughter's sin? Torture us or curse us if you need to. I'll give whatever you want. But don't take my Padma's life. Already she is bed ridden with a disease which even doctors couldn't detect, Ah! Is my Padmavathi on death bed? Padma! What are you looking at? Catch him! [chains rattling] Padma! Padma! Padma! Vijay! Padma! Vijay! What is all this? Who tortured you in this way? Padma! They say some black magic is torturing you... The King suspects me that I have done all this... and punished me like this. What actually happened Padma! Last full moon day night, some strange power came to me, and took me to a very dangerous place. There I saw a dangerous statue. and a fierce looking man. Vijay, I have a life threaton the coming full moon day. Princess! Princess! Soldiers! Padma... no one can harm you until I am alive. I'll find out what is that evil power is. I shall leave. There he is! Vijay! [horse neighs] [horse neighs] Our guy has escaped! [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [horse snorting] [horse snorting] [horse neighs] Oh no! Oh god! We will take him to the Ashram. Mother, Vijay is escaping from the soldiers. We saw it with our own eyes. -Say it man! -Yes, he was riding a horse. Why don't you bring him home if you saw everything? Why do you want him here? For the soldiers to arrest him again? He will be safe anywhere but here. That's what! Vijay is talented. Mother, he will be fine if you stop worrying about him. Exactly. Mother... Dear, how are you feeling now? Mother, you seem like a goddess. You've treated me with motherly love. You are staying in this tranquil environment. Who are you, mother? Son, this is the monastery of the great hermit Jamadagni. What happened to you? Who has hurt you? We don't know what happened to the people who went to bring that vicious. We don't know to which side they fled. The astrologers said that our daughter will be in danger on every full moon day. Full moon day is nearby. Sooravarma, what were you doing till now then? I've sent the soldiers to every corner for that vicious guy! I asked them to bring the dead body if he isn't caught alive. By the time you kill him, that wizard will turn into a mosquito or in a fly and kidnap the girl by entering into the palace. Did he find our innocent girl to trap? What might be the bad deeds in our past lives that he is harassing our girl. Calm down. Minister, we shouldn't care about this Sooravarma's trials, but we should perform an exorcism. Summon all the seers from the different countries. But mother, it's the only thing which is troubling me. The astrologers said that the princess has a life danger on every full moon day, An evil power is torturing her as they said. Mother, I should somehow save the princess before the full moon. I regained my strength with your support. Let me take leave. Son, you are leaving to oppose evil powers. Take the blessings of that Goddess Vajreshwari. Victory will be yours. [water burbling] Mother of all, oh merciful Goddess, protect your devotees by supporting them all the time. Son, this is a blessing of Goddess Vajreshwari Devi. Evil powers cannot harm you until you have this divine guard. Son, don't remove this guard no matter what. Mother, I've got yours and that Goddess's blessings. What else do I need? I'll find out the evil power and oppose it. I'll leave now. Take care, son. Be careful. Alright, mother. [satanic chants continue] [satanic chants continue] [gasps] King... King... Hey! [wind howling] [shouts] [shouts] [thud] [shouts] [thud] [knife swishes] Victory to you, warrior! I'm a nymph. Don't doubt. I'm residing in front of a witches' cave because of a sage's curse. You have freed me from the curse. Oh brave one! The wizard is going to offer the girl you love. But mind this warning. You might dare and face the wizard, but this is not the right time. Take this ring. You can control that bed with its help. Take the princess and leave as soon as possible. I'm indebted. Victory be with you [satanic chanting continues] [satanic chanting continues] The time is approaching. Take a head bath in the south-eastern pond. Should wear the sacrificial dress and should return back soon. [anklets jingling] [water burbling] Padma... Padma... Padma... Vijay, where are we? I will tell you all later. First, come with me. [satanic chanting continues] [evil laughs] Your plan has been spolied. The bed has fled. Hey! [satanic spell] [laughs] Your spell won't work anymore. [satanic spell] That bed won't return. Bhairava Dweepa's saviour... [satanic chants] [water burbling] [evil grunts] Eat the boy by opposing, torturing and stabbing who took away the woman by entering into the temple. Bring the woman here by holding with your teeth. [grunts] That wizard would've sacrificed me if you hadn't come on time. You need not worry anymore. We have escaped. [bird screams] [gasps] Vijay... Some evil bird. [bird screams] That wizard might've sent it. You be brave. [grunts] [screams] Vijay... [grunts continously] Vijay... [wind howling] [bird screams] [grunts] [gasps] [bird screams] [screams] Vijay... [thud] [indistinct voices] Oh no... [indistinct voices] [bird screams] [groans] Vijay... [thud] [shouts] Vijay... Vijay... Vijay... Vijay... Vijay... Padma, you don't worry. This bed will make you reach safely. [groans] [bird screams] [collapse] Father, what is use of regretting now? You all have suspected Vijay without minding my words. You've blamed and accused the adventurous hero, who saved my life by putting his life. I don't know where Vijay is now and in which condition he is. [footsteps arriving] -Wow! -Wow! -A male man! -He has washed ashore. Poor guy! He is drenched. Let's shift him to a dry place. Let's change his wet clothes. [laughing] Let's tease him. Let's play with him. [laughing] Hey! Who is that? Dare to face me and hit but don't hit while hiding. We will not face you. Guess us. Catch us if you can. [footsteps leaving] [indistinct voices] Leave us... Who are you? We are naughty devils. -We are naughty devils. -We are naughty husband and wife. Naughty devils? You are brave as you didn't run away by seeing us. You are capable to help us. What is that help? We are the devils in the Bhairava's cave. -Bhairava? -Yeah, do you know him? He is the vicious one who tried to sacrifice my girlfriend. He was angry at us since we asked him to stop such activities. And then he threw us in this desert by tightening us in a jar. While we were suffocating in that jar for years, a blindman has come to this desert. [laughing] Oh, brave man! Oh, saviour! -Who is that? -We are naughty devils... We are naughty husband and wife. Dear helper! You've released us from the jar after so many days. Ask us what you want. Helping the one who helped us is our devils' family tradition. -Isn't it? -Yeah. I'm starving... I'm starving since many days. Give me something to eat. Oh! Is it just that? [laughing] -Have it. -Have your stomach full. Fruits... Fruits... Delicious foods... [wind howling] Oh wicked one! How dare you to eat food by entering into my favourite God Tumbura's temple? You have desecrated this temple of music. Tumbura God's temple of music? Forgive me. I couldn't see the pedestal as I am blind. This mistake of yours is unforgivable. I'll make sure to keep you starve for life long. From then, we gave him food everyday... and the horse came and kicked. -We gave him food, -And the horse came and kicked. Poor fellow! We are unable to make him eat some food and return his favour. As you are adventurous, if you trap the horse and make him eat food, we will leave. Alright, I will try as you wish. Well done brave guy! [laughs] That blind man is in that Tumbura's temple. Take this. Sir Get up and have some food. Who are you? How does it matter? Have the food. No, I don't want. I don't deserve. The sins and evils that I have committed are afflicted me. Let me starve to death. Sir, don't feel nervous. [gasps] [wind howling] [horse gallops] Hold on, Pegasus. [sighs] He is a blind man. He didn't commit the mistake knowingly. Anyway don't you have any other way to punish him? Why are you interrupting him from having food? Who the hell are you to teach me? Even you might face the same situation if you talk more! Forgive me, Pegasus. Tumbura, whom you worship is the man behind the origin of Samaveda. Peace and love is the meaning of music. How dare you speak about the vast music which you aren't aware of? What do you know about it, silly human? Everything is known to you. With the music, the fire will flare, the clouds will rain, trees will sprout. Infact the God himself will present. Is an act of violence in such a holy place of music righteous? If it so, do you have the power to make this temple bells ring with your music? Everything is possible with your blessings.

You made me happy with your mesmerising singing. You made me calm. Wish for what you want? Forgive his mistake made in blindness. I'm requesting you to give him sight. Let that happen then I'm thankful to you Pegasus. Oh, master singer! Your wish is selfless. Im happy, I'm offering a boon to you too. Whenever the route is tough and you have to go to an unfamiliar destination, I'll take you there, upon remembering me. A great boon! Son. I don't know who are you but I'm feeling glad by seeing you. You are not an ordinary person. How can I return your favour? [laughing] Thank God! Now your hunger is fulfilled and our debt too. Yeah, yeah. Adventurer, we should do a favour to you for helping us. I want only one thing. I should protect my girlfriend from the occult of that wizard. Oh! Is it just that? Look adventurer, if you travel towards east side after crossing this desert, there will be a world named Yakshini Loka (Fairy world). There is a powerful necklace called Shata-Ratna in that world. If you make the princess wear that necklace around her neck, that wizard's powers will not work before that. It's a victory for you. We will leave now. Tring... Tring...! [laughing] Son, you leave now. Come back victorious. King, you... There is no one for me. I'll make my way. King, don't worry about the past. It's not safe for you to stay alone in this desert. I live at Kotala Kona. You please go there. My parents will welcome you. Son, your parents are very honourable. My mental stress is increasing every other day by witnessing the moon in the sky. Thyajulu, how many more days left for the full moon? King, today is ekadashi. There are three more days left for the full moon. Three days? What should we do if that Vijay doesn't come to protect my daughter? What should we do now? How should I protect my daughter in three days? Who will protect her? Minister, make the announcement. Make the announcement in all the countries. Announce that I'll give away my half of my kingdom to the one, who can protect the princess from the occult on the full moon day. Not only that. Also, announce that I'll get my daughter married to the one who protects her. -King... -What I say is final. I don't scare even if I lose the entire kingdom. I just want my daughter's life. Minister, we don't have much time. Send the men promptly and announce immediately... Announce immediately... -Announce immediately... -King.

[screaming in lilliput language] Are you the one affected with a curse or the toys that are alive? Oh! Do you speak Telugu? -We speak Gulute. -Gulute... Gulute... Which means, you speak our language only but you reversed and named it as Telugu. We thank you. Oh no! Reverse it and say the same thing. It will become his language. I understood. It means, you saved me, I'm grateful to you. By the way, who are you? We? I am Janedujaay. -Betthedubaay. -Pidikedupaay Veleduvaay. By the way, why did you come here? [sighs] I started on an emergency work. I'm struggling to choose my way. [speaking in lilliput language] No, he is a huge human. Huge human! Tell us about your problem. We will help you as much as we can since you saved us. -We will help you... -We will help you... Oh! Is it so? So, there is a world called Yakshini it seems. There is a necklace called Shata-Ratna necklace it seems. Suggest me the way to that world if you are aware of it. -We know... We know... -We know... We know... Tell me if you know. We will tell you... Huge human! We know where the Yakshini world is. We will take you there. We will show you where that necklace is. But it is your responsibility to possess it. I'll take care it. Let's go. This is Yakshini world. Did you see that, huge human? Look at there. Can you see the door there? That necklace is right there. It seems like the door is locked. We will search for the key but you make sure that Fairy doesn't notice us. Yeah. "Oh human! Tell me your wish" "Oh human!

How dare you sought Shata Ratna necklace, by rejecting me while I came for you? This is my curse for cheating me! Let you lose the handsomeness with which you attracted me and may you turn into a hideous handicap! If you reveal your identity, or if the necklace falls on the ground, the necklace shall lose its power and becomes useless. [water burbling] [sobbing] Son... Son... What happened to you? What happened to you? Mother... I'm praying you happily by considering that flower as my son. Tell me what happened to my child who is in your purview. Tell me... Tell me... [sobbing] Vasundara. Swami, what is this tragedy? You gave me a boon saying that my son will be safe still the flower blossoms. Now, what happened to him? Swami, tell me... Swami, tell me... Vasundara, don't worry. The flower has lost its colour but didn't lose its bloom and dry. Your son has just faced a danger, that's all. But he is not in a fatal situation. Stay brave, child! The midnight hours are approaching. None of them has come to protect my daughter despite numerous announcements. Isn't it anyone in this country who can protect from the occults? Look at there... The deadly cloud is arriving. The deadly cloud is arriving. -Hey, wait! -Who are you? Where are you going? Who are you? Princess, wear this necklace and protect yourself from the danger. Hey! Who are you? Look at your attire! Drag him out. King, trust me. She will be saved from the risk if she wears this necklace. She will be fine. King, he is very awful. What if he is hoodwinking us? Reject it. King, this is not the right time to discuss. [gasps] Everyone will be upset if it is delayed. Let me save the princess from being taken away by the wizard. King, I'll plead you. Please, understand me. King, it is nearing... King... King... Alright, what's going to happen will happen. Padma, wear that necklace. Princess. Gone... That deadly cloud has gone... -Padma, we got you. -Father... -Padma, -Mother... It is God's grace. God has come in time and saved us. Sir You have rescued us from trouble. You are God to us. Who are you and from where did you come? How does it matter? I was able to fulfil my task. You achieved the work which wasn't achieved by our relatives or any warriors and proved that you are a great warrior. No matter how many services I do for you, we cannot return your favour. King, duty doesn't expect gratitude. Princess, at all times and under all conditions that necklace should be around your neck. Kindly, don't remove this necklace under any circumstances. King, goodbye. Announce that I'll get my daughter married to the one who protects her. Sir... I made a hasty announcement, that I'll get my daughter married with the hope of saving her. Now... King, what do you mean? Are you planning to get our daughter married to this handicapped beggar? Would you ruin her life by pairing her with him? He helped as he got the opportunity. Present him jewels if you want to gift him. But don't agree to get him married to Padma. Today we encountered a problem which was never faced by this Karthikeya dynasty. Would I become a wretched father by agreeing to this wedding, or would I become a black spot of this clan by not keeping my word? What should I do? What is this deadly situation? Father... Dear... Dear... Father, you don't worry. My thanks to you for saving my life. It's my responsibility to tell you a truth. I loved a person named, Vijay. I've long back dedicated my heart to him. Anyhow, my father gave his word who hails from the great clan of honesty, gave his word. According to his word... I'm showing my integral consent to marry you [wedding percussions] [auspicious chantings continue] Stop! Haste makes waste! Who decided it to be an auspicious day? This is inauspicious time. Wait for some time, there will be an auspicious time. Sir, who are you? Didn't you hear the name of Mattebha Shastri who is known as future teller, godly, timeless and the greatest teacher? -Ah... -[laughs]That's me. Oh! As I heard the news of the royal wedding happening at an inauspicious time, I came rushing. I'm happy that they aren't married yet by God's grace. What? Do you doubt the auspicious time that I've fixed? [sniggering] Calm down. You will get to know in time. Ah! The glittering necklace around the bride's neck was brought by the groom, isn't it? Yes, sir. That is a powerful necklace. That necklace has saved our daughter. Oh! You are getting your daughter married to him as he brought it, right? Groom! The one who brings the necklace should be a great warrior, but you are handicapped. My suspicion is how it was possible for you. What is it, King? There is nothing wrong in what I said, right? You are right. He should be a great warrior to bring this powerful necklace. How could you bring that? That is... If you reveal your identity, or if the necklace falls on the ground, the necklace shall lose its power and becomes useless. Look King, he is fumbling. According to him, it's not him who attained this necklace. Someone should have given to him or he might've stolen from someone. I don't have any need to steal it. I attained this necklace. No, you conspired to marry the princess. King, mind my words. A great warrior called Vijay has attained this necklace. Vijay. I say that you have committed an atrocity and stole the necklace from the warrior by betraying him. What is your stand for this? You are on an auspicious wedding seats. Swear on the mangalsutra in your hand and say. Is it Vijay or not who attained this necklace? Yes, it's Vijay. Vijay... My Vijay... Is it my Vijay who attained this necklace? Then where is my Vijay? Yes bride, shoot him with straight forward questions. Tell me, what did you do to him? Where is my Vijay? What did you do to him? Father, he is a wicked one! He has stolen this necklace by killing my Vijay. He planned to enjoy by marrying me. Princess, I'm not a cheater. Trust me. What is the use of this necklace and being alive without my Vijay? Princess, don't remove that necklace. -Leave me. -Listen to me, Princess. Don't remove that necklace. -Princess. -Leave me. Listen to me. Don't remove that necklace. Princess... [sniggering] Goddess! Dear Padma... Goddess! I brought the bride to offer as per your order. [shouts] [sniggering] Jittu, you are smart. Thank you! How dare you to escape the offering by getting ready for the wedding? Keep this girl here until the full moon day. Imprison her. And espy her. Dear Vijay, forgive me. We harassed and punished you by misunderstanding. You sacrificed a lot for my daughter and took a lot of toils. How do I appreciate you? Dear, this tragedy wouldn't have happened, if we had recognised you in this appearance. What can we do? It's just our fate! King! Don't worry. I'll start immediately to Bhairava Dweepam. I'll somehow save my Padma before the full moon day. I'll leave now. Mother! I've been trusting and praying you for these many years. What is the danger faced by my son? How is he? Tell me... Tell me... What happened to him? Tell me... [sobbing] Mother. Who are you, dear? Mother, it's me Vijay. You allayed me when I came to you with scars. You tied talisman to safeguard me from the bad omen. Everything went well until I had the talisman. Mother, I'm starting to Bhairava Dweepam now. I came to take your blessings. Dear, what is this appearance? -A Fairy's curse. -Curse? When did it happen? before the last full moon day. It was on dwadashi. Dwadashi? Yes, mother. Dear, whose child are you? Who are your parents? I don't know whose child I am but, I grew up at Kotala Kona, on the bank of the river Gomathi. I was found to the tribals in my childhood, while I was washed away by the river on a Ugadi. Ugadi... In the river of Gomathi... Son, you are none other than my son. [gasps] I am the unlucky one who lost you. -Mother. -Yes, son. I am your mother. -Mother... -Son... Mother... Mother... Mother... Mother of the world... you gave my son back through my husband didn't accept me on that day. Mother, who is my father? The King Chandra Prabhu. [gasps] The King Chandra Prabhu? Then, I met him. -You? -Yes, mother. He was depressed because he is facing the wrath of the sin of refusing his wife, whom he married in a celestial wedding. Mother, everything went well. Though we both aren't aware of each other, I felt pity for him and sent him to my hamlet. Well done, Vijay! You are not a normal man but a man with a mission. Which is why a Fairy gave you a boon. Achieve your goal and become victorious with its help. Greetings to you, Pegasus. I should reach Bhairava Dweepam before today's midnight. I'm pleading to you to take me there according to your word. Master singer, forgive me! Now, you are the victim of curse. It is forbidden for a cursed person to ascend the Pegasus. It is forbidden. But there is an option. You'll get back your appearance if any altruism perceives your appearance. Forgive me, Pegasus. I cannot make others suffer by transferring my handicapped form to them. I'll start with my perseverance.

"Goddess Shambhavi, the one who has the majestic walk" "You are the Goddess Kali, Haimavathi, the three-eyed one" Mother... "Any time ever..." "did I ask you any wish even in my dreams?" "Not having the power to oppose fate" "I am praying to you in this way" "Please end all my troubles" "Please put an end to my tears" "Show me kindness" "Please, let this tragedy pass" "Won't you melt being a mother?" "Won't you melt being a mother?"

Mother... -Get up, Vijay... Get up... -Mother... This is Goddess's determination. This is the appearance gave by the Goddess so that you can achieve victory. Don't get upset. Mother, I came here for your precious blessings but, I didn't expect that it would become so worse. Look Vijay! This is not the right time to feel sad. Ascend the Pegasus before the full moon. Stick to your duty and start your journey towards victory. Return with victory. [no audio] Hail Goddess! [sword clunks] Padma... Padma... [thud] Hey! [sword clunks] [sniggering] [groans] [groans] Hey! [groans] [groans] [thud] [grunts] Vijay. [groans] [groans] [thud] [groans] Hey!

[shouts] [shouts] [groans] [groans] [thud] [collapsion] [thud] Padma... Padma... Padma... Let's go. [squealing] [thud] [thud] Congratulations, great warrior! You've achieved world order by killing a demon which wasn't possible by anyone. Make a wish, I'll fulfil. Oh Goddess! I'm requesting you to restore my mother's previous form, who sacrificed for me. So be it. Mother... Well done, Vijay... Your life became a part of history. Dear Vijay... I betrayed this righteous woman who has given birth to you. As a result, both of my sons banished me instead of taking care. You saved me though I rejected you. You made me realise. And united everyone. Not only that, you saved my daughter's life by destroying the evil powers. King, this is not my credit. [sighs] I'm just a spectator. Nothing would'be been possible if I wouldn't have the blessings of, all the Gods, my mother, the love and affection of the parents who raised me and the support of the people in my hamlet. Wow! Your humble obedience is appreciable. The country will be happy if the one like you rules with the ideal salvation, thinking about the problems of the common people. Vijay... Vijay... Why did you leave me and come here? Father, everyone is here. Mother, I came here by jumping off the wall. Chandra Prabha King, I request you to get your son, Vijay Chandra Prathap, marry my daughter Padmavathi Devi at the earliest. Thank God! I am out of a big trouble. -What is it? -We need not jump the castle wall from now we can come royally. How is it? [laughs]
