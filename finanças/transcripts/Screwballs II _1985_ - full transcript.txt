Can you move it to the right? And stand up, sit down, fight, fight, fight. - Good afternoon, students. This is Principal Hardbutt speaking. I would like to take this opportunity to wish each and every one of you my very best wishes for a happy summer. Expect for the following, who will report to my office immediately. Brad Lovett. - Shit. - [Principal] Steve Hardman. - Damn. - [Principal] Hugh G. Rection. And Marvin Eatmore. Please remember, to leave your desks and lockers neat and tidy and exit the school in an orderly fashion. (cheering) (screaming) - Buh bye. See ya. Have a good summer. Caio. See you back in the fall. - [Woman] Hey, Jake. (upbeat 80s music) (cheering) (chattering) - [Boy] Look at this. Look at this. - Congratulations. These are the lowest marks ever recorded at Beaver High. Don't you think four years in grade 12 is enough? You guys have screwed up every hour of every day since you set foot on this property. You've been disrespectful, disruptive, a complete disgrace. However, I've decided to give you one more chance to graduate.

First a survey. (energetic 80s pop rock) (horn beeps) Welcome party our mission, should we decide to take it, is to locate and ravage as many woman on that bus as possible. (laughs) - Yeah, look at them. Little darlings. The best of the worst. - Welcome to Coxswell Academy. I've been assigned to give you your orientation tour. Here at Coxswell, we believe in a sound mind and a sound body. Therefore, before we begin our rigorous program, we require that you all take a medical exam. - [Women] Medical exam? - And you're? - Candy Barr. - Oh really? Can I take a bite later? - This is my friend Tracy and this is my friend Gail and Nikki. - Hi. - Hi. - Now, when you get inside-- - Aren't you gonna come inside? - Oh I'll be in there before you know it but in the meantime, you'll see signs directing you where to go. It's very important that you follow the instructions on those signs. Gentlemen, if you would, please go around the corner and the ladies, follow me. - (mumbles) one of those lecherous types. - Yeah, that depends on how gorgeous he is. (laughs) - Ladies, your examination. Doctors. - Thank you, young man. - Thank you, sir. - Over there, please. Right into the corner. Now, to begin the examination. I'm going to ask you young ladies to strip down to your bras and panties. Right behind those screens. - Doctor, I have this little problem. What if I don't wear a bra? - Do you have tits? - Little ones. - I'm going to make an exception. You may take the examination. - Thank you, doctor. - You are such a genius, master. (upbeat electronic music) (sleazy jazz music) - How come he's got a video camera? - Have you heard of video dating? - Yeah. - This is video x-ray. - [All] Oh. (laughs) - Oh, oh my god! Oh my god! (screaming) - Hey, they're not doctors. - No, but he was. (laughs) (screaming) (energetic instrumental music) (Screams) - Well, well, well welcome to Coxswell Academy. Let me introduce myself. I'm Principal Arsenault. (screaming) And if you're responsible for that lovely couple, I don't think you're gonna like it here. (tense music) Well, gentlemen. Let me tell you about Coxswell Academy. We pride ourselves on tradition and high academic standards and nobody steps out of line. (sultry jazz music) Don't any of you move an inch. - Jesus, we've already moved nine. - Hello. Hi, you must be Ms. Lott. Welcome to Coxswell Academy. - Why thank you. Mr. Arsenault, I'm really looking forward to it. - Is there any way I can be of assistance to you? - Um, yes I believe you can. Can you show me my box, please? - Certainly, must have your name across the little slot or something. - I know but some of these slots are smaller than others and I guess that's okay as long as my mail doesn't get bent in half. - Um, oh here it is. Mona Lott. See you've been getting some mail already. - Oh I get my share of mail. - I bet you do. I was thinking at the first convenient time for you we should get together cause I may have another position you might be interested in trying. - Oh, well any position under you would be just fine. - Well that sounds pretty encouraging. - Oh and um, in the meantime, don't forget to tell any students who might be interested that I'll be available for private French lessons in the evening. - Oh, (speaks French). - That's very good. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. - Alright, you squid brains. I'm gonna overlook this little stunt of yours just this one time. But if you try anything like this again, I'm gonna make this the most miserable part of your life. Do I make myself clear? - [All] Yes, sir. - Now move out. (goofy tense music) (rock music) - Shit, what a dump. - Well at least it beats that reform school they were gonna send us to. - So where does Arsenault get off, anyway? I mean this isn't a school, it's a concentration camp. - So Bradly, where's all these luscious babes you promised us? (rock music) - So who's in charge around? A teacher or somebody? - Nobody, I think we're on our own. - Alright, anybody want a smoke? - Sure. - Spark it up. - Take your pick. - The big one. - Of course. - maybe this place is gonna be alright after all. (whistle blows) - A ten hut. Do I smell something burning? I said do I smell something burning? Turkish blend. Now, there will be no smoking, no drinking, no swearing, and no screwing around. Understood? - [All] Yes. - Yes, Ms. Von Blow. - [All] Yes, Ms. Von Blow. - Good. Now, beds. Beds will be made every evening at 10 o'clock. Lights out every morning before school and uh... And uh, try to be good girls. Whenever you can.

I'm hungry for sex. - So where's all these girls we're supposed to meet? - Yeah I thought we were gonna screw. - So I can get you guys anything? - Sure. Four cokes and give me a little cherry with me. - You'll be lucky if you find any around here. (laughing) - I don't know about that. Take Hugh for example. - Man shut up. Tell the whole. (laughing) - Hughie, before this semesters out, I guarantee that you lose it. - Yeah just take a look around this place. Can't miss. - Let's turn this situation into an instinct project. I propose that we start a point system. 10 points for every girl that we score. Five for an almost and two for look see and a cool 100 for a certain Ms. Mona Lott. (sultry jazz) - In order to roll your R's correctly, the sound must come from deep in the throat. You must relax the throat muscles. Now a well lubricated throat is essential and remember, for good French, you must take a very long, deep, (sighs) breath. (laughs) Now you try it. (rolling their R's) (laughing) it's good, it's very good. (bell rings) Okay, don't forget to study your French over the weekend for the oral exam on Monday and the quiz on Wednesday. Au Revoir. - Uh, Ms. Lott. - Steve, was it? - It still is. Steve Hardman. - Well what can I do for you, Mr. Hardman. - I really need some French. - I beg your pardon? - I mean, I really enjoy French. I'm going to Paris in the fall and I'd really like to get some French under my belt. I overheard you say in the office that you were available for private tutoring. I thought maybe if you weren't doing anything tonight-- - Oh tonight? - Yeah. I could uh, I could do it at your place or in my room or anything you want. - Hey you guys. I was so impressed I bought the whole company. (whistle blows) Von Blow. - You girls should be ashamed of yourselves. I've never seen such a disgusting array of perversion. I'm gonna have to confiscate everything. - She'll probably wear out my vibrator. (laughing) - And if I catch any man in this dormitory, I'll see to it personally that he sings soprano for the rest of his life. - Hi, there. Sorry I'm late. I had to pack my suitcase. (laughing) - There's something suspicious here. Come closer, young lady. What's this hair on your face? Have you been taking steroids? - No, have you? (laughing) - Quiet. Don't get smart with me, young lady. What's your name? - Brad... Bradine Lovett. - [Von Blow] What is wrong with your feet? - [Brad] They're flat. - Yeah, like her ass. (laughing) - Be quiet. Well make yourself at home. - Thank you. Oh poo, all the beds seem to be taken. Gee, do you suppose I could share with anyone? - Oh you can share my bed. - Maybe I'll just sleep on the floor. - It's alright, Ms. Von Blow. Bradine here can sleep with me. I'm used to it. - Is that okay, Ms. Von Blow? - Well just for tonight but remember what I told you all. No screwing around. - We wouldn't dream of it.

It's okay. I don't really need one. - Everyone needs a bath and everyone is going to have one. If I had my way, I would make the whole world take a bath. Cleanliness is next to godliness, you know? - Rub a dub dub, two girls in a tub. - There's lots of room if you want to come in. - No, that's okay. I'll just sit here and watch, I mean just wait until you're done. - We won't be long anyway, Bradine. - Oh that's okay. Take all the time you want. I'll be the official blow dryer. - There, all done. Could you hand me a towel, Bradine? - No. I'm just joking. Here. - If you're modest, Bradine, the door locks. - Get clean, Bradine. - Damn it. (banging at door) - [Von Blow] Bradine, I don't hear any splashing in here. I want to hear lots of splashing or I'll come in there and wash you myself. - I'm splashing, splashing. (soft whimsical music) - I got caught, too. - Wasn't that door locked? - This door? No, it's busted. - Oh. - You don't mind if I jump in, do you Bradine? I think we're out of hot water. - Uh, no. I don't mind. - You don't have to worry about me, if you're shy, I can't see a thing without my contacts. - Right. (humming) (laughs) Oh, look isn't he cute? - Cute? I've heard him called lots of things but never cute. - He's pink, isn't he? I can't tell without my contacts on. Pass him over here, I just want to squeeze him. (squeaking) - Oh the duck. - Look at him, he's so cute. (laughing) could you pass me the soap, please? - Sure. Oh, oops. - Oh I'll get it. - No I will. - No, no I will. I know where it is. It's right between your legs. - It is, it is. - Where is it? You must be sitting on it. - I hope so. - Oh boy. - Oh. - Well I'll wash yours if you wash mine? - Sure. - Here you go. Hey Bradine. - What? - You don't happen to know any nice looking guys around here do you? - Well, actually there's one guy who kind of turns me on. His name is Brad. - Yeah, what he's like? - Well, firstly, he's a hunk. - A real hunk, huh? - Ah numero uno. - Okay, you're turn. - Oh, my turn. - So Bradine, about this guy Brad. Bradine, did you forget to take your bra off? - My bra? This bra. Well it's wash and wear, it's okay. - Could you introduce me to him? - To? - Brad. - Oh Brad.

And after I've gone out of my way to make her feel comfortable and secure here at Coxswell and then you go pull a boner like that? You like water, Hardman? - I like water, sir. - You like getting your perverted little hands wet? - I guess I'm gonna have to answer yes to that one, also, Sir. - Well far be it from me to deny you your pleasures. I think I have just the thing that will keep you happy all term long. (tense music) - Well doctor, must take a lot of patience to do that. - Don't forget class. - Nothing? - Nothing. - Not even a feel? - I got a feel alright, for scrubbing floors. - Could of done better than that at the fitness center. - Yeah from the jets of the whirlpool, huh? - Come on, didn't I tell you guys that Mona belongs to the same club that I do? I saw her there the other day. - Mona Lott, the French teacher? - None other. - [Steve] Is that a fact? - [Marvin] Yeah, she's really into heavy massages, too. - You're gonna have to get a membership. - No, i can't-- - Hi, Bradine. - Who's Bradine? - It's a long story, Marvin. - Wet one, too. - Working hard? - Sort a. I'm trying to figure out the logistics of fourth dimensional film making. You know, 4D. - I like a man with a good head. - Oh really? - So you guys, we were just wondering if you'd like to come to a beach party with us later? - [All] Sure. - Yeah, when and where? - Around the bluffs, three o'clock. - Alright. - Fabulous. - Great.

It's not big enough anyway. - Spent a lot of time in the water together, lately. - Yeah, whenever I'm near you I get wet. (sultry music) - Hey Tracy. How bout going for another swim? - But we've been swimming all day. - Yeah but uh, that was with bathing suits on. - Now, where were headed after our bath that night? - I think it was to bed. - Skinny dipping in the moonlight? Alright, let's go. (sultry music) - Our mentor and founder, J. Peter Coxswell. Of course, this is only a small scale model. I want you all to take a step in here and take a good look at this. I mean not only is this a beautiful piece of artwork on its own right, I also think it captures the intellectual and moral strength of which this school prides itself on. Yes, the renowned sculptor will soon be arriving from New York to create the full scale model, under my supervision, of course, and he assures me that it will be ready in time for our founder's day celebration. (applause) (soft jazz music) - That's a nice racket you have there. - Thanks. I just picked it up this morning. - Nice and tight, just the way I like it. - Well you know what they say, the tighter the better. - Yeah but uh, the secrets all in the stroke. - Oh do you like to play? - I've played with some of the best of them. - Well if you're serious, our club is looking for an instructor. As you can see, I really do need the lessons. - Well as I said before, Claudia, it's all in the stroke. Some ladies like a hard fast stroke while others seem to prefer a long slow follow through. As for myself, I enjoy doing it both ways. - Which do you think is best for me? - There's only one way to find out. (soft jazz music) - Jeez. - This is the lesson I've been looking forward to most. - See ya on the green. - What's that noise? - Nothing. - Somebody's coming. - I know. - Sorry, buddy. I have to play it where it lies. (screams) - A little hydrochloric (mumbles). (soft goofy music) now for some real special effects. Goodbye, bathing suits. (laughing) - Hi, girls. - [All] Hi, Marvin. - [Marvin] Are you gonna be swimming for awhile? - [All] Sure. - Great.

I said, get out of the pool cause its time for my... (moans) God. (Water splashes) - To stimulate sexual desire in the female, apply vigorous pressure to the soldier blades. Subject will become sexually aroused. Hey, heres your 200 bucks. (oriental music) - Okay, but you no be very long. - Don't worry about me. I got the fastest fingers in town. - I'm ready, Hung Lo. - Oh. Me ready too, Missy Lott. Feel good Missy? - (mumbles) - [Brad] Takey off, missy. - No, of course not. - [Brad] Oh I'm so sorry, missy.

Hung Lo, I think you've broken my neck. - Oh so sorry, missy. So sorry. - You're not Hung Lo. - Would you believe I'm his long lost brother, Well Hung Lo. - Help! Help! - One thousand times. (energetic music) - How's the arm, Shakespeare. - So what's the tally out here? - I'm just figuring it out. - Hey, make sure you don't count Brad's poor attempt at the fitness club. - Did you see anything? - Yes, she got a great pair of tonsils. - Should of seen the experiment we did in biology. (laughing) - That was a real first hand experience, eh Marvin? - Yeah. - Sure it must of felt real different for somebody else to do it for a change, hey Marv? - Whoops. - Whoops. - Not tonight, big boy. I've got a headache. But I'm available anytime for Hughie. - I'll never figure out woman as long as I live. - Well you better figure something out, Hughie. You haven't racked a single point up yet. - Don't worry about me. I've got my strategy all planned out. (horn blares) - Ow! (shushes) How was I supposed to know that thing-- Ow! - Now this new position I'd like to see you in Mona will be very very satisfying for both of us. Probably more for me. - Hold it steady, Marv. Hold it steady. Mona Lott screen test. Take one. Lights. Camera. Action. - Can you see anything? - [Hugh] What a pair. With a body like hers, I may have to turn this into a double feature. (dog barks) - What's she doing now, Hughie? Is she bare naked yet? (shouting) there's a huge beast down here. - Marv, what's going on down there? - [Radio] In local news, a recent survey by a prominent company confirm that the most sexually frustrated men are high school principals. It also... - It's gonna swallow me whole. It's big and hairy. - If I die,, I'll kill you. - Get it out. Get it away from here. - I can't, I can't hold it any longer. Oh no. Careful. (shouting) (dog barking) - Where you going? I didn't say cut. Get back here. Hi, Ms. Lott. You're probably wondering what I'm doing up here? I could say I was here to shoot a new film version of Romeo and Juliet. Marv down there, he'd be Romeo and you, well you'd be Juliet. But I won't. Or I could say that I was here canvassing for the local candidate. But I won't actually, I'm just here to gaze your tits. (shouts) Ow. - Every window in the school, twice. (sultry jazz music) - Upstairs. (upbeat music) - You sure this is gonna be okay? - Don't worry about it. My husbands at his office. No one can stop us now. - Alright. - [Steve] Okay, Claudia. Now lets see your forehand grip. Hey hey, take it easy with the zipper. Oh. (laughs) (goofy sultry music) - [Arsenault] I'm back, dear. - Oh my husband. - Oh shit. - You've got to get out of here. - Where am I gonna go? - Out the window. - What? No way. Oh shit. - Try under the bed. - There's no way I'll fit. - Quickly, under the covers. - Hi. - Hi, dear. I just forgot my briefcase. So uh, what are you doing in bed? - Oh I've got a headache. - Oh a headache? Well you look kind of sexy. You know dear, your ass is still firm after 15 years. You know, I think I got a remedy for that headache of yours. - Honey, we already did it this semester. - Yeah but what about the finals, babe? - Class dismissed. Really, I have a thumper of a headache. - Yeah well, it is getting kind of late. And good luck with the thumper and can you do me a favor? Try not to wear my white athletic socks to bed anymore, okay dear? Thanks. - Finally, he's gone. Let's do it. - Now I've got a headache. - Well I know just the thing to cure a sore head. - No, I've got to go. - I've waited too long for this. - No really, I can't. I can't. Please, no. (screams) - Darling, are you alright? I'll be right down. We'll do it in the bushes. (goofy music) - Come on, Marvin. If I couldn't, if Steve couldn't, and if the whiz kid over there couldn't. How the hell do you think you could score with Mona? - [Marvin] Show him, Hughie. - It's easy. Come here. - What's that? - [Hugh] It's a schematic drawing of the girls changing room. - Oh you figure out a way for me to get in yet? - What about the windows? - [Computer] The proportional dimensions indicate it would not be feasible. - What about the walls? - [Computer] Concrete. Penetration possible only with dynamite. - No, too messy. - Hold on. What's the most optimum way to gain a vantage point to girl's change room? - [Computer] The ceiling is made of false sound proof paneling solution. Enter through ceiling. - The rest is up to you. (laughing) - How'd you like that hole, Marvin? - Biggest hole I've ever been in. Oh jeez, there's spiders up here. God I hate spiders. Oh, oh I think I got one in my mouth. - Just swallow it, Marvin. You can eat anything. - Real funny. There it is. Oh Hugh, if you've done homework then I should be right over the girl's change room. That computer was right. (laughs) I'm making it. (whistle blows) - Okay girls, times up. - Deana, are you going Friday night? - Sure yeah, definitely. Let's bring some drugs that she got. (overlapping chattering) - Oh what a set. Oh, Hughie you really ought to see this. It is wall to wall tits and ass. I am dead. I am dead and I have gone to heaven. - She's coming. (chuckling) - This is unbelievable. I'm going absolutely crazy. These girls are delicious. - [Hugh] Take it easy, Marv. It's only half an hour to lunch time. - Oh she's coming, she's coming. She's coming just like you said she would.

Now get the hell out of here, now. - That's the last straw. - No it isn't. We got lots more, guys. - So what now? - Go home, I guess. - No graduation. - No diploma. - No college. I guess that's what hurts the most. - What, missing a college education? - Na, no college babes. - Speaking of babes, what are the point standings, Hughie. - Chances of this happening are 9,378 to one. But we're all tied. - If any of us had scored with Mona they would of won. - Yeah and we never found if she was a real blonde or not. So what. Neither did Arsenault. - We sure showed him. - Bullshit. That's nothing compared to what he did to us. - There must be someway to get even with him for throwing us out of school. - I know a way. - What? - You'll see. (upbeat electronic music) Okay guys. The coast is clear. - Hughie, you sure this is gonna work? - [Hugh] Don't worry, guys. When this baby blows, Arsenault will be in for the surprise of his life.

Glad, we're all honored that you could make it today. - Well as chairman of the board of education, its my duty to see that the memory of a man like J. Peter Coxswell is treated with all due respect. As you know, he was my great great grandfather and today's event is very important to me. - Well I've seen to it personally that this will be a memorable occasion. - I hope so. Let's go in, shall we? (applause) - Thank you and welcome everyone. Today is a very special day in the annals of Coxswell Academy. A day that will go down in history.

Cut the film. (laughter) Turn off that film. Mr. Chairman, I apologize. This is not my idea. I don't know how-- - You're fired, you, you, Arsenault.
