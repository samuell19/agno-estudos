Edward? I need your opinion. I like the first one. I'm serious. Dante wants a second dinner. It's okay. It's my turn. Ah... Thanks, hon. Move! Is Edward sleeping? You know my husband? I know he's in the house. That's right. He's probably called the cops by now. If you stay quiet, I'll explain everything. - Okay. - Sit. What's this about? Here, for your back. Everything okay, honey? Yeah. It's fine. I like the second better. What? With the two pictures. Good. That was my choice too. But, they're so similar. You can barely tell them apart. Debit, credit, and public transit card. We can even use Bitcoin if you wanted, which you probably don't. Real time social parking that allows users to sell their street spaces to other users. So, say you got this fantastic spot on Union, and there's someone willing to pay premium for it. Why just give it up for nothing? Our app makes that market transaction happen. It allows people to rent private spaces to the public. Trade sweet spots regularly for a fee. A portion of which goes to you guys. And our platform has taken in the data of every user in real time, getting smarter by the minute. We use differential data to prevent privacy leaks... Down the road, in-car voice-activation. I've got a meeting set with Volvo next month. It's all coming together. Show them. It's as simple as tap and swipe. Impressive, huh? Yeah, guys, looks good. Leena's cooking up a new splash page, so don't worry about that. Questions, concerns? Well, I'm getting some pressure from Mike about the schedule. Oh, we can probably shave that down like five weeks. Yeah, maybe four weeks. Four weeks is tops. Yeah. We're thinking Thursday. But... Hey, we had a handshake deal for months. You know there is no way we can build that fast, Reed. Yeah, well... Mike has a guy who can. Mike. Who? - Gentlemen. - You fucker. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Come now. Let's talk it over with some tea. Seth, I told you about it in confidence. I was gonna hire you, man, come on. I remember. I remember the lowball offer too. And I remember thinking why gig for a company who's hemorrhaging cash when I get the same contract with my own team? Fuck you! Come on, stop. Pull yourselves together, guys. It's still an open bid. Fuck you! Fuck you! Okay, you ready? - Mmm-hmm. - And... Pencils down. Uh-uh. Just doing some skin shading 'cause that's the hardest part. Are you giving me a beard again? Ooh, just about there. Okay, on three. One, two and three. Oh, my God! - What? - That's not even me. It's perfectly to scale. I measured it... Oh, there is my inspiration now. Oh, you don't have a fucking chance. Sweet, sweet Carmen. Looks just like my picture. Yeah, you should show her that. I'm sure she would love it. But, um, we were supposed to be drawing each other. I'm not an artist. Not all of us have had a gallery show. You should be doing more than lining pages for parking apps. Look at that. Look at that right there. Even I know that that is really good. Can you stop making that my screensaver? It's not funny. That's from a long time ago when I was very deluded. - You were not deluded. - Thank you. Not one bit. Ew. Are you flirting? No, unless it's working. No, you look like Hannibal Lecter trying to take a shit. - Yes. - Gross. Cool. You guys ready? - Thank you. - Passing down. Take this. - Thank you. - Put that in your face. All right, Carmen, may this black liquor sauce steal our nerve in the face of defeat. Cheers. Cheers. God knows we're well-practiced. I really thought this is the one. Come on, guys. We weren't gonna cure cancer. It was a parking app. Yes, but if it worked, we could have moved on to bigger shit. I'll be happy just turning a profit. Man, fuck profit. I just wanna make enough money, so I could, like, fucking blow up a million dollars. You what? I wanna fucking just blow up a million dollars. Well, I told you that house you guys are renting had bad energy. - Oh, Carmen, no. - What? Zip it. Not tonight. I'm just saying that old lady straight vanished two years ago. What, the one who was there before? She didn't tell me about this. No one noticed that first because by then she had become a hermit. Police searched the house. All her stuff was there... and she wasn't. - Ignore her. - Uh... No. Hey! And you need to stop watching ghost hunter shows. That's bullshit. I'm not saying ghosts. I'm saying the place is cursed. If anything is cursed, it's me. Every company I touch fails spectacularly. I supposed we could try for more funding. I don't wanna think about it. I mean, no app means there's no way I can pay rent. Come on, let's just try and enjoy tonight. We might not be together like this for much longer, so... Have a drink with me. No more drinks for you. - Yeah, come on, let's have another shot. - No, water. - No, let's have shots. - No, we both need water. Josh, you want another shot? - Josh, no. - Hurry up. Would Elon Musk let a bit of failure get him down, huh? You hear that? You hear that? That's another one of his rockets exploding. But, you know, he won't sweat it and neither should we. I can't believe you got tired of those blue eyes. Hmm? Oh, God. Don't shit where you eat. I learned that the hard way. We did not make a good couple. Hey, Carmen. You have a boyfriend. Hey, look at Josh. - Guys! Code Josh. - Yeah? Oh, shit. - What's happening? - Okay, so, he's been eyeing her since she came in. Come on, Joshie. I'm just saying it's off. - I'm just saying he doesn't care. - Not okay. Oh, no, there's her boyfriend. Whoa, whoa. Why don't you fuck off, motherfucker? - I'm gonna fuck you up. - Fuck you, man. - Fuck off. - Fuck you. I love how each time it's just a bit different. - Can you just carry me? - No. - I don't wanna... - Okay, cool. - Hiya! Whee! - Oh shit! Oh, shit. Don't worry about it. Oh, I thought she was really cute. How was I supposed to know? Well, she had a boyfriend. They all have boyfriends, okay? Until you get a few beers in there. No! The framework is doable. Yeah, now we can build it. I takes two weeks. We got until Thursday. Yeah, it's not ideal, but if we dig in, we can put something together. You wanna build it up. The interface will go back to Bootstrap. Yeah, it's a UI, Leena. It's not gone in to MoMa. - Uh, excuse me. - What? - You heard me. - What do you think, Devin? Robbie's got an opening in this company. I've been thinking... I think I'm gonna take it. Yeah, I think it's... I think it's time to let this all go. Phew. All right. I'm going for a run. Okay, so what, after everything, you're just gonna bail? Man, I'd do anything for a bid. I put all my savings into it. It's done, all right? We failed. No, no, no, no. We didn't fail. - Just let him go. This is what he does. Runs. - Hey! No, we didn't fail, man. We were this close. - Just let him go. - This close to a huge contract, okay? Look at that old logo. How much have we accomplished since then? - Josh, it doesn't... - How much... - Stop it, okay? - No, fuck all this, man. - Fuck! - Hey, calm the fuck down, okay? - Totally calm. - Yeah, fantastic. Who needs a security deposit? - Jesus. - No, wait a minute, you're not leaving. - What you doing? - Listen to me. - I understand. - I gotta get out of here. Noel, don't. - This is a fake. - What? Come check this out. This whole wall. Move the washer. Look in there. If we just... - You want me... - Should we? I'm pretty sure we lost our deposit anyway. Holy shit, there's, like, a staircase back there. - Guys, guys, check this out. - You gotta come check it out. Holy fuck. And you dummies thought we didn't have a room for an intern. Whoa! When they put the place up for rent, the bank must not have found this. Maybe someone lived up here like a squatter. Yeah, some asshole probably sub-leased it. Guys, check this out. Look. Ooh. who's the babe? I don't know, but she's in every picture. Yeah. She's a twin? Hold up. Look. Look, same dates, same cover photobook. Different copy. Mmm-hmm. Maybe she designed the cover? But why would someone follow their twin all over town? Hundreds of pictures. Whoa! Is this the woman that Carmen was telling us about? The hermit who vanished. Josh! I feel like... Guys, there's a fucking passageway to the back of the house. - Get out of here. - I shit you not. - No way! - What? - Oh, shit. - Right? What is this? Oh, my God. Take a look. Oh, ladies clothes. That's nice. Ow! Oh, my God! It's... It's every room in the house. That is bananas. Whoa! What the fuck, man? Jesus! Are you okay? Oh. Don't move. What the fuck? What did it feel like? Warm tingle like... Like when your foot's asleep. - Oh, my God. - No, no, don't. Don't. Oh, my God. Watch out, watch out. Let me try. Oh, I can feel the floor. Oh, that is so weird. What's it show? It's this room without us. This is huge. Fuck it. What are you doing? Aah! Neil Armstrong ain't got shit on me. - Josh, no, wait, wait... - Wait, wait... Guys? Hut! Hut! Good game. I don't know why you're always picking out this game. Because you suck at this. What? I don't! What? I don't! - Watch this. - Oh, shit. - Oh, you never concentrate. - Shit. It just pisses me off. I know. But this could be our last barbecue, so let's just try and enjoy it. - Come on. - Okay. You wanna grab me that beer? Hey... - Boom, baby! - Hey! No! Guys, I don't like... Here. We'll switch. Thank you so much. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God! - Are you okay? - I saw us. What do you mean "us"? Us. I saw us. I saw us. I fuckin' saw... - Us, here was this? - Yes, us here, right now. I watched us. I watched us for 15 minutes. You were gone for, like, five seconds. Stop. 9.7 seconds. 30 minutes. - What? - Jesus. Okay, rounding up. Ten... Three... So, that's... That's a time dilation of 180. - Explain that to the designer. - One minute here equals three hours there. I still don't get that. You said they were grilling burgers every time? So, it's like a time jump? No. Because where he's going to, we didn't find the mirror. Think of it, we found it through a series of random events. Like, why did you go to the laundry room? - I needed to think. - And why did you throw the wrench? I don't know. I was pissed at him. So, those versions of us, they didn't find the mirror, so, for them it's just another day and they're cooking, right? Yeah. Can I see the video again? - Yeah. - Thanks. So, what are we gonna do now? - Get it downstairs. - Yeah. - It's crazy. - Yeah. Back. Again. So, it has to be this angle and probably the spot too then. Explains why it's bolted to the floor. Wait! Josh? Josh? Where's Josh? What do you mean "where's Josh"? What happened? I stepped into this room, it was empty and then... - Well, where is he? - I don't know where... - Where were you? - Where were you? I don't know. Give me your hand. No, no, no, no, no... Okay. Okay. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, okay. So every time you go through, you enter a new attic with the same start point. But when you go back, you always re-enter our world. And each time you go through, it's like it resets the timeline. But, what are those other timelines? I think it's parallel universes. - Holy fuck. - Yeah, that's another way of saying it. Wait, that explains the periscope. Yeah, you use it to get out of the house to avoid your double, so you don't interact. Well, what would happen if you do? Multiverse collapse. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't know that. Well, but probably best not to chance it, right? What we do know for certain is in those universes, time moves significantly slower. You know what we could do? Yes, 30 pepperoni. Send two orders for, I'm paying upfront. - Noel, you're ready? - Yep. Okay, cool. So we'll be gone like a couple of hours - and then it is done. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, we'll have to beta finished for you in maybe five hours. I call it "Operation Fuck Seth." Nice. Noel. - Noel! - Huh? Dude. Quick, quick, quick. What now? Bad news, guys. Just kidding. It's time to call Reed. What happened to you? You wanted Meter Maid by Thursday? How about right now? Rise and shine. I thought you might wanna give Meter Maid a look. How the fuck? There's no way you could have built this so fast. You call Reed. He'll give you the details. - Bye, motherfucker. - Bitch! Success feels so different, man. - Whoo! - Whoo! I don't get it, just the other day you all said it was hopeless. Well, we, um, found our unfair advantage. - What's that? - Um... This guy's raw animal magnetism. Oh, God. Wow. You can have secrets or free drinks. But you can't have both. Ooh. Guys, what the fuck is that thing? "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." That's Arthur C. Clarke. "Everything is theoretically impossible until it's done." Robert A. Heinlein. Gotcha. I love pretentious quotes too, but, guys, you're missing the point. Whatever it is, the genie is out of the bottle. So, let's make a wish, huh? I already made one. While I was in the alternate universe, I watched the lottery drawing, then came back here which was before the drawing actually took place, because of the mirror time differential, right? - Right. - If the same lottery numbers are drawn here... then we can pick the correct lottery numbers whenever the hell we want. - Oh, that's genius. - No, wait. The universes might not be perfectly parallel. There could be variations. Man, you're just speculating. All I'm trying to say that the multiverse is a big hunk of Swiss cheese, and that mirror let's me see the future. - Quiet. It's show time. - What's the payout? - Eight million. - Oh! Fuck. - Eight million? - Oh, my God, I can get behind that. - ...49, and right after that we have... - Okay, here we go. - Okay, cross your fingers, - Come on, come on. - Cross your legs. - I crossed, crossed. Okay. ...and we have the number 41. And we're going to wind it up for you, America, with the number 53. - Fuck. - There goes that. The universes not being identical... Maybe it's not such a bad thing after all. Now, we go in as pairs. Okay, Leena, you're with me. Oh, no, I think we'll cover more ground if we go solo. If something goes wrong, you need to get back here. You may need someone to help you, so... - Yeah. - Let's go. - You good? - Mmm-hmm. First one to murder a person wins. - What? - Come on. Don't allow your double to see you. If they discover you exist, how you got there, things could get messy. The worst mistake a startup can make is to jump in without understanding the tech. The goal is raw data, as much as we can get. Right now, we're just trying to understand how the alts differentiate. - Alts? - Alternate universes. - Done. - And? Nothing. I've done the Washington Post, there's only slight variations there, Sports, crosswords. The universes are too parallel. Yeah. Few minor bits about the Louisiana purchase, but it's just word choice, events are the same. I think our next focus should be geography. Modern day street maps, that kind of thing. Yeah, all good, but... I gotta eat. Mmm. I do say rather splendid meal, yeah? Hey, do I have anything in my teeth? You're good. A $300 tip? Yeah, screws my double, but since I'm him, I can tell you for certain, he'd do the same to us. - Ooh. - Good cat's got claws. So, now what? You've bought your new camera already? You're wasting your time. I've been through all those maps, street names are the same, building names are the same. It's getting kind of pointless, don't you think? I mean, we don't even know what we're trying to find. What's that? That's the diary of the woman who used to live here. The hermit who vanished. She wrote a ton, see. Her name was Marissa Whittacum. She moved here after her husband passed. She discovered the mirror randomly, just like us. And at first, she was just, like, obsessed with following herself around. You know, how the mirror helped her see who she really was, gave her perspective, point of view, yada-yada-yada-yada-yada. But then, it gets really interesting. She had this idea, maybe people who are dead here might still be alive in other universes. So she went on this quest to find her husband in an alt where he didn't die on a hiking trail, just searching, and tracking and looking. It's kind of romantic, don't you think? I wonder what Josh and Noel are up to. God. I don't even wanna know. So... You wanted to blow up a million dollars? - Yes, I did. - Mmm-hmm. Yes, very much so, Ready can make your dreams come... - No, dude. No. - What? He doesn't go like that with the whole hand. He just takes one... - Can you just do it my way? - Sure, man. Okay, thanks. So, ready to make your dreams come true? Yes. Yes, I'm ready for my dreams come true. - Okay, good. Good. - Mmm. - How about this? - Oh. That's fantastic. Make me want some... Some lasagna. Oh! Oh, my sweet boy. You're a sweet boy. There we go. Mmm. Holy shit! What the fuck? - What? - I don't know... - I lit it. I lit it up fine. - I saw it. What the fuck is going on? Why isn't it blowing off? That was actually pretty cool. Oh, fuck, I wanted to do that since I was, like, six years old. Oh, hold on. Hold on. Check this out. Hey, where did you get that from? I got a permit. From another universe. Check this out. Oh! Can I give it a go? Sure. Yeah, do it. Find me a target. Don't you shoot me now. What the hell is this? Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in Frankenstein. Ryan Gosling did Frankenstein? No. Not in a million years. Not my Ryan. Looks like shit. Dude, they didn't do Frankenstein together, they did a bunch of other movies. This is like some joke, I think. Yeah. Wait. What if it isn't a joke? This is what we're looking for. Never thought I'd hear you say that about a Ryan Gosling movie. I can't believe any universe would put that out. So, decisions involving artistic inspiration have higher variation. - Exactly. - Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, creative people are solitary, free thinking... - Stubborn. - Independent. Whatever, the point is... If this is right, we focus on industries with highly creative decision makers. Oh, my God! Look Mona Lisa's hair's short. What the hell is this? This is like the biggest unfair advantage in human history. It's... We bring information from those universes. - We're not sure what'll happen. - No. No, no. Disruption causes opportunity. So, are we just stealing other people's ideas? This is what Seth did to us. No. No. he'd stab us in the back in the same universe. - This is victimless. - We don't know that. Look, you're not getting in our way this time, okay? God. Keep your voice down. What's that supposed to mean? Guys, we're adults. Everyone can do what they want. - Devin. - No. No, no, no, no. Let him go. He's a smart guy. He'll come around. And you've never shown before? No. When I graduated I saw a lot of my contemporaries panic to produce work. But, um, it was very important for me to truly take my time to find my voice. And you have more of these? Uh-huh. Yes. Can we pull up the schedule. Sure thing. I'd like to make some changes. Honestly, I'm just excited someone from MIT wants to talk to me. You're kidding? I mean, the Alumni magazine's thrilled they've found you. You're one of our most brilliant graduates. But we want to know what you're working on now, so, I mean, please be as detailed as you can. I think this could make the cover. Well, there is something I'm working on. It has... Oh, hey, man. Uh, so, this is Jenny. You're friend's a fucking warlock. He can tell the future. Uh, why don't you go upstairs? I'll be up in a minute, okay? Okay. - What's up, man? - It's back. It's back. It's back. Hello again. We're back with... - Have you seen this? - ...our special guest, Noel Anderson, one of the founders of... Look what's happening while you're Groundhog Day-ing girls. Rumors say you're branching out to so many new things. How did it happen so quickly? What I can say is that... Well, he's certainly taken Betafire up a level, hasn't he? What we're trying to do is challenge what's possible. And for us, that is all about solving problems that people don't even know that they have yet. If you think about what Henry Ford said about the Model T. He said, "Well, if I'd ask people what they wanted, "their answer, a faster horse." Can you give us a sneak peek? Well, if even a fraction of these products hit the market, it'll hit big. Hashtag Betafire. Thank you. Thank you. So, it's not magic. We don't do that. Let me show this to a special group of people. Keep it to yourself. Lookie, lookie. So it's just a prototype. Let's see how mass production goes. So, this'd probably explode in my face. So modest. Hey! Is there a yoga convention going on here? Look at you guys. Last month you could barely get a parking app off the ground and now you're Steve Jobs with an accent. Hmm-mmm. Somethings behind all this. Yeah, it's called hard work. Oh, yeah? And the Orion Skyfund? That was hard work too? Orion Skyfund? What? He didn't tell you? 10 million, that's one hell of a parking app. I don't know what kind of deal with the devil you guys struck but we all know that you ain't that good. Aren't you too new-age for jealousy? I'm not jealous. Just curious. It makes sense, he'd be up to something if corruption runs in Devin's family, right? I'm gonna let you take the first swing and I'm not even gonna fight you. Come on. - Come on. Calm down. - Throw all the parties that you guys want. Everyone here knows you're a bunch of failures. - Really? - Shit's gonna regress to the mean. Why don't you invent a scarf for men, loser. Calm down. Okay? Not here. Josh. Yeah, so where were we? It's just a prototype. - Man... - Feel it. Like paper. - Hey. - Hey. - You got a second? - Of course. What's up? The Orion Skyfund. What is it? It's just preparation for our next move. Don't worry. I'm not gonna do anything without telling you, okay? - You trust me, right? - Of course. Yeah, I just want... Just wanted to get an update. Absolutely. Tell you what. I got to go take care of something. Why don't you come with me, we can talk along the way. Oh, Jesus. Sorry. - The hell are you doing? - Noel, come on, man. Hey, sorry. - A basketball. - Yo, Devin. Hey, can you get your friend here and his meds and get him - the hell out of my house? - Chinese? Sorry. Sorry. - Yo! - Noel. What are you doing? This yours? - Huh? This yours? - Come on. Come on. You're doing some coding here? - Coding? Huh? - Dude, come on. Fuck! - Damn! What the fuck? - Huh! No! - Come on! Are you kidding me? - Wow! Jesus! Who's the fucking failure now? What the fuck is wrong with you, man? Noel! Come on. Give him a kick for what he said about your dad. Fucking loser. - Give him a kick. - What are you talking about? I don't even know his dad. Let's go. - What the hell was that? - That was just messing around. - Messing around like assault? - This is an alt. He's a real person. Is he? You need to quit those journals, man. Josh, if you read these, you see this old lady Marissa, she started to lose her mind. I'm worried about Noel. No, you need a break, man. You want to come with me? Come on. I'm going out to alt Carmen's. Yo, man. Doesn't all alt Carmen have a boyfriend? Yeah, well, if you give her a gift, she kind of forgets all about Mr. 150. Oh, God. It's our unfair advantage. You got to embrace it, man. Come on. We don't do shit together anymore. I fucking miss you, man. You fucking miss me? Yeah, I miss you. I think we need a little Devin and Josh adventure, what do you say? Right? How did you get this? Seriously, I have all their shit. How did you get this? Well, they sent it to the real fans. Oh, my God, I love the guitars. - Come here. - Oh, yeah. You can meet me back over the other side, Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Hey. Hey, man. Hey. - I want you to stay. - Okay. I want you to stay. Why don't you go downstairs and listen to me have sex, like a good friend. Okay, I'm just joking, but I'm not at all. - What? - You're like totally different. All right. I'll tell you. I'm off gluten. It's changes me. Whoo! Don't you worry. - No, I'm serious. - No, I'm just saying. I'm just saying. I think... You weren't looking. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Come on. Oh, fuck! No. Don't leave. Noel! Leena! Get in here now! Oh, my God! What happened? It's a shot in his leg. Oh, my God! Get him a fix. Wrap it up right now. Fuck it! I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't know this. - Like this? - Wrap it up. Come on. Wrap it up, right here! There's too much blood. I can't do it! - Josh! Josh! - Come on! Call 911! Come on! - Leena, call 911 now! - Calling 911! Josh, stay with me. Come on, man. Josh, what do I do? - Call 911! - Oh, my God! Just breath, man. Come on. Come on. I don't want to fucking die! I don't want to fucking die! You're not going to die, man. I promise you. So, you're telling me I have a part in this, right? - We're calling the police. - We all have a part... - You want to call the police? - Correct. - You think that's smart? - We're calling the police. That's it. You're so fucking stupid! What the fuck! What the fuck were you doing? - Hey! Calm down. - Fuck you too! We have to call the police. There's a bullet in there, and they'll have a fucking forensic up here try to tie it to a gun which won't exist. Won't be the first unsolved murder. Look... I'm gutted about this just like you but just because this is tragic doesn't mean we stop thinking. We don't have any other option. That's not true. What are you saying? I'm saying that we can't be arrested for murder if Josh isn't dead. Wait a minute. Are you saying that we... You're talking about kidnapping. - This is fucked up. - Yeah. This is fucked up. And I'm saying we use the tools at our disposal. - But how would we do that? - How? We'll take his phone, clear off anything, wipe his fucking machines, think of it like a time backup. But we need to move fast, majority rule, you know where I stand. No. I say... You say what? I say we do it. I... Josh wouldn't want us to give up the mirror and this way we don't lose him either so... - So let's do it. Okay. - Good. Good. You're gonna help? You made life happier for everyone you met. You didn't take shit from people and I respected that. - Hi. - Hi. You're awake. - Here you go, man. - Thanks. What the hell's going on? Can't leave the place in a mess. Leave? What are you talking about? Where are we going? - I told you he was fucking hammered last night. - Yeah, you were. We sold the company. Yes, right. Of course. No, no. We did. Um... To an Israeli VC based in Vancouver. - Are you serious? - Yeah. I mean, they got a bunch of mobile parking place and they're probably just going to scrap the Maid, but I think I speak for us all when I say who the fuck cares. And all this happened last night? - It's been... - Well... We wanted to make sure that it happened before you say anything. We couldn't talk. - NDAs. - Ugh! The NDAs were a nightmare. It's just nuts. Well, look, guys, if you think that I'm just gonna be cool with fucking stock after all this hard work? What is this, like, ten grand? Yeah, I mean, that's just a taste of it. And hey, also, um, Stanley Tech. We thought we would - send your work in and... - They fucking love your shit. They want to offer you a lead developer position. Stanley Tech? - Stanley Tech? - Isn't that wild? Holy shit! You always wanted to be there, so... He did it. He did everything. No. It was an honor. Hey! Yeah. Brought you something to eat. Noel and I are heading back in tomorrow to raise more cash. You should come with. Might help you get your mind off of things. I don't want my mind off of things. So, what's the plan? Steal more sketches? Pawn them off as your own? That's not what I'm doing. I'm not stealing sketches. - I'm appropriating arts... - You copy them. - I don't copy that. - You copy them. I heard about your upcoming show. Inspiring stuff. - He was my friend too. - Yeah? Does a friend stand there and watch their fucking friend die? So, I'll hit Bank of America and you see what you can get from your dad's corporate savings. Wrote up the details there. Maybe it was a bad idea to go after my dad. Yeah, but when did he ever support you? Never. So, meet back at the attic. - Come through together. - What's that? - Next gen e-reader. - Ooh, can I see? You can look all you want later. It's time to make some money. You're doing okay? Yeah. I was just, um, just you know, thinking. Good. I don't want you winding up like the last guy. Oh, I thought you knew. The guy who had your job, he had kind of a meltdown situation. He posted videos online about bombing the office and then he said it wasn't him. God, he must've had a complete mental break. Surprised you didn't hear. Yeah. No. It's tough at a new office. You'll feel that you don't belong. I don't practice with myself. I'm a professional. Yeah. Oh, sorry, I didn't know you're out here. Leena. I was a prick last night. I'm sorry. This whole thing has got me messed up. I don't... Listen, about your dad, you're searching for him in other universes, aren't you? Um... I love my dad, Leena. When an investigation like that breaks in a small town, it becomes big news. I used to... dread seeing the newspaper, or going to school. Few of my best friends turned on me and started talking shit about my dad. Got into a fight. They beat my ass. And I was so angry. I got home and I just... I just gave it my dad, like, "I fucking hate you." "I fucking hate you." He ran out, and... two nights later they found his body. I found his body. I never told anyone about that before, so... So, yeah, I'm looking for him, you know. What will you say if you find him? I don't know. Since when does he sleep all day? Hey, you shouldn't be spying on him. No, I'm just concerned about him. Yeah, well, he just lost his best friend. That is breaking the rules. I know, I'm just trying to take care of him. There's things you don't know about Devin. Do you know why Pixel Tel failed? Uh, yeah, Flickr stole your features. No. It was Devin. He just left the company for a bit. Sometimes things gets too intense for him, he just runs. Can I show you something? I found it in an alt this morning. They call it the Effluvium. Whoa! It's not hot. Here, feel it. So it expands matter at the molecular level. It's like burning or melting without the heat. Um, what's it used for? Manufacturing, healthcare. I didn't have much time. Point is, I've got a storage unit full of stuff that will set off revolutions. It's not about selling the mirror or books and movies from the alts. Right now, Devin's too torn up because of his big heart to see it. He doesn't understand. Not like you. You always dream big. I'd forgotten what it was like to smile. You okay? Yeah. It's good to see you. I'm sorry. I know it's hard seeing me like this. And they say it's better to talk about small stuff... I want to talk about what happened. - Let's not dig up the past. - No, it's important. You know... It haunts me what I told you. Before you... Before I tried to kill myself. Yeah... All that stuff I said. You called me a criminal. Said I ruined your life. And I wish you'd said that earlier. I got involved with some bad people. I should've stopped them but I... I was just too weak. I let you down. Let your mother down. But... But I believe in you. You can be different. Dad, I just feel like if I had said something sooner... Listen to me now. Listen to me. A man is his own actions. - Hey, Devin. - Yeah. You looking for me? I thought we might have a drink. You trying to kill me? - It's changed a lot. - Mmm-hmm. - Our first business. - And most gloriously illegal. It was your idea. Fake driver's licenses are high margin. Until the campus cops bust your lab. But they never got us, eh? Wasn't I who snuck out the window and jumped into Debbie Adam's room. Oh, my God. I had to pretend that I liked her for, like, two months. She was so into you. She painted that horrible portrait, remember? - It looked like you had a skin disease. - Oh, God. Fuck! Man... How did we let shit get so fucked up between us? Yeah, I know. It's crazy. Don't give me that bullshit. Josh is dead. We gotta do something about it. We can't let this define us. The Orion Skyfund is gonna send Josh's family five grand every month. What's he gonna think about that? Rich second cousin? His mom will never know, and when she's gone, the payments will go to the new Josh. Sound good? Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great. It's good to have you back. Bottoms up! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Oh, my God, Devin! What are you doing here? - Came to support you. - Aww. You came to support this show. That is so nice of you. You know why? Because you're so nice. You are. Come and check it out. It's so rad! - Do you like it? Ooh. - Yes. Would you take a picture of me? I want to send it to my parents because it turns out that they can't make it. - I think you've had enough? Huh? - Yeah, you're right. - Excuse me. - I don't like that wine. Tastes like shit. - Am I right? What? What? - Keep your voice down. Keep my voice down? Why? Everybody loves my voice. It's so original! - Listen... - No. Hey, you're right. I'm a fucking fraud. Hey, excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Can I get your opinion. Do you like this picture here? No, you don't, do you? Leena? Time to go, all right? - Yeah. I wanna go home. - Good. Let's go. Come on. - Okay. - Thank you, guys. Good night. Go to bed now. - Shh. - Yeah... Two months ago, I would have killed to have any art career. I mean, that's all I've ever wanted. But then tonight, I saw this little girl idolizing me and just made me want to vomit. I always liked your old stuff. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. I even went to your first gallery show. What are you talking about? Oh, my God! I can't believe you went to this show. I loved it. Then I guess it wasn't a complete disaster. Failure is crucial. It is the best way to learn. - You think so? - Yeah. Sometimes we try so hard for something, and it never happens. It sticks with you. I got first hand understanding of that. You need to know I really wanted to make a move. Noel was just quicker to market. Did you just refer to me as a product? Not in a bad way. Thank you. Thank you for looking after me tonight. So, what happened? - About Noel... - I know. I know. What are we gonna tell him? No, I didn't mean about us. I'm talking about what he's doing. You've seen it. The guy's been going 24/7 for weeks, and he doesn't even look tired. - We know how to manage him. - No, this is different. Did you not finish those journals? - No. - Marissa, the woman before us... Her plan was to switch places with herself in an alt. This sweet, middle-aged romantic woman, she was gonna kill herself. Jesus. We gotta do something about it. I'll talk to him. I promise. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's still going straight to voicemail. I told you. This is what he does. He was gone when I got up, and when things get intense, he just runs. - So you're not worried at all? - Mmm. No. I mean, give him two weeks, he'll be back with a new idea. - Fine. - You just sit back. I'm cooking. Enjoy the celebration. - We're celebrating? - Yeah, you almost got 40 mil. Enough to buy the block. We're buying the block? Yeah, we can't have the planet's most valuable technology on a residential street. What happened to keeping a low profile? We know that Seth is watching. Forget about Seth. I'll take care of him. I've put a lot of thought into it. I've been thinking quite a lot, actually... about us. "Us"? Well, like "us" us? In what capacity? I want to give it another go. What? Are you out of your mind? Noel! I mean, we failed miserably trying to work together while having a relationship. - It was awful. - Five years. Struggling. No money. Barely getting by. - It does something to people, right? - Sure. It's like I can finally breathe. And that's wonderful. Truly. But I don't think money was the reason we didn't work out. - Okay? - You're telling me you're not happier now? What? You're different. You're different. I have to take this. I keep losing shit, like stuff that I know where I put it. I know where I put it. And then... And then it's just... And it's just... It's just missing. It's stressful starting a new job. Fuck you! It's not the job! I'm sorry. It's okay. It's just people... People keep saying that, you know? And... I've had a lot of jobs before. I know. I know. When I was in fifth grade, we had this Swedish exchange student that came to stay with us, and he dyed his hair red. Red. And in all the photos I have, it's green. But I know... I know that it was red. People misremember eye color and stuff like that all the time. Yeah. What's that? What's that, huh? - It's a children's book. - Yeah. Yeah. My mom read all these to me when I was a kid. I stared at this every single night. - So? - So there's no fucking G in Callahan. Now there is. It wasn't that way when I was a kid and I swear my fucking life on it. I found a pistol in my backpack. That's not mine. That is not mine. There's this pain in my stomach. And I can't shake it. Everything is just, uh... Off. It's just off. I'm sure he wasn't easy to see, but he'll adjust over time. He told me about the guy he replaced at Stanley Tech, the YouTube meltdowns, the bomb threats. Tell me you had nothing to do with that. I needed to ensure our new Josh had a job he'd be excited to start. You've crossed a line. No, we crossed a line. You ruined a guy's life without telling me. His life was already ruined. He was a software engineer. I'm not here about the other night. I just need to talk to you as a friend. - Now's not a good time, Leena. - Please. I don't have anyone else to talk to. Devin, I'm not leaving until you talk to me. Devin... Dude, what the fuck is going on? Where are you going? Great! So you're just gonna leave and let me deal with everything? You know how Noel gets when he's caught up in something. I don't need to know anything. - At least not till the lawsuit is over. - What lawsuit? Seth Reed suing us. - No, they're not. - Noel told me. - He's lying to you. - Why would he lie, Leena? I don't know. Maybe he found out that we made love, and he's trying to get back at you. - Right. - Fine. Whatever. - We had sex. - What are you talking about? - What? - If we had sex, trust me, I'd remember. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. No. No. Not you. Okay, um... Okay, You're not gonna understand this, but you have to listen to me. Whatever Noel has told you is bullshit. Who you think you are, where you're from, it doesn't exist here. There are other realities. I know that sounds crazy, but you have to believe me. The Leena you know, that's not me. - Leena, I think you need to just... - Wait, Wait, wait. Let me... I can prove it. You gave me this the other night. But you don't remember, do you? Forget it. I... I have to go. I have to go. And you're positive? Definitely. He structured the shell companies so no one would know. And that's not all. I've heard they hired two patent lawyers. That fucker is filing patents? He's probably got $20,000 in fees alone so far. You got any idea what he's up to? I'm gonna find out. Hey. Hey. No. Put that... Put the bag on the ground. Put the bag on the ground! Okay. You want to talk about this? Yeah. Yeah, we can talk about this. We could talk about you giving me ten grand to fuck off. No, that's not how it was. I'm not fucking stupid! I mean, I was stupid to think that we actually sold Meter Maid. But to plan this whole charade, you must be up to something pretty big. You don't know how it works. I'm taking the mirror with me. Unhook it right now. No, you can't just unhook it... Unhook it right fucking now. Do it. Do it. - I need... - Do it! - Hurry up. - I need a wrench. We don't have a fucking wrench, okay? So, you're gonna figure it out. Tool box. Don't move. You're a piece of shit. I should have known better. You don't know anything. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Why did you make me do that, man? Why did you make me do that? I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't mean to hurt you. Oh, God! Hey, look at me. Look, you're gonna be okay. Noel. What have you done, huh? Why do you have to complicate things? I got it in the side, but I think I can make it. Yeah, maybe. But it's easier this way. Jesus. Don't sneak up like that. Big picture? This is for the better. Now I'll show you the plan. As my search for mentors who had major life changes in the alt seeing if they created anything different and my leg work paid off. Because it's not about being the richest guy in the world. It's about being the Thomas Edison of our time. It's anti-gravity. - We'll take the world by storm. - We? You and I have always been leaders. We're different from the rest and the world needs to be led. You will handle art and culture. I do the rest. We split it 40-60. Art and culture, you know... - The thing is, I love you. - Don't say that. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. I've confessed love to ten different versions of you in the last two days. Just let me show you. Look. Those other Leenas... There's something wrong. Their smile is off. They don't compare. Baby... What do you think about that? I think... I've missed you so much. Stay here. Okay? You bitch. Why'd you do that? So, what? Are you just gonna kill me? You'll swap me out like you did Devin? He was going to talk, and we couldn't have that. He was your best friend. I love Devin. You know that. But an opportunity like this was too big for him. Well it's too big for me, so just kill me. Please! Now you listen to me. You're a smart girl. You'll come around. I'm not some guy with an unrequited crush. I get what I want. Fuck you! Fingerprint recognition. I can't let you go. Damn it. Hey. I don't know what she's told you. She's fucking crazy. She tried to kill me... Look at my leg. She tried to fucking kill me, she's talking about mirrors and time travel and shit. - Let her go. - I wouldn't lie to you. Who took care of you after... Get him before he get to the mirror. He's gonna come back. - He's gonna come back. - But he's been shot. No. There's another. He's gonna come back... Okay, let's go. My car's downstairs. No time! How did you know? If you're watching this, you don't remember filming it. Now listen carefully to what I'm about to say. I always been a paranoid person. Guess this time it paid off. We have to destroy it. - Think of what we could do. - No. It'll only lead to destruction. Someone smart told me that once, but I didn't listen. Twelve past the hour. Breaking news this morning from the National institute of science. A major breakthrough in converting cellulose into... Authorities attribute the discovery to an anonymous delivery of a prototype... If researchers can reverse engineer the technology, they could possibly end world hunger. ...wild two days in which institutions throughout the nation received anonymous donations... ...has no message for the anonymous donor except to express thanks on behalf of the entire planet. Okay. So, what's next? STAN, Black Swan, Dead Pixels. Dead Pixels? God. Haven't heard them in years. What? We played them an hour ago. Oh, yeah. Sorry, totally spacing out. Come on, let's get moving.
