- Come pick me up at 5:00. - Yes, sir. Please bring me the Bersch file, Miss. Good. Okay. You can go now. - It's nasty business. - Give me that file. Have a seat. Gentlemen, here's the case report on the death of Dr. Bersch. He was killed by a rogue agent working for a foreign power's spy agency. With the murder of Dr. Bersch, the only man who knew Dr. Calvert's research formula... ...now we are faced with a big problem. We must safely bring Dr. Calvert back to the United States. Right now he's in Europe visiting his daughter who attends a college in Switzerland. In short, what kind of danger is he in? Our adversaries are interested in grabbing him so they can gain possession of the formula. As you know, the formula was never written down. Professor Calvert keeps all of it in his head. They could also kill him so the formula isn't used by someone else. I mean by us. Calvert's way of doing things is well-known in scientific circles. He shared only the bad formulas with his colleagues. Only Dr. Bersch knew the formula and the structure of his invention. And what does this invention consist of? As far as we understand, Prof. Calvert has discovered a way... ...to solidify rare gas, i.e. helium. Helium originates from the Sun. And it seems like it wants to return back to the Sun. In other words, Calvert's invention allows the submarines to resurface in any situation. And spacecraft could fly through the cosmos as they please. We'll entrust the mission of protecting and repatriating Calvert... ...to one of our best and bravest agents who is currently over in Europe. The same agent who successfully completed Mission Pentacle. - Who is that? - George Collins. Will you teach us how to water ski? Yes, of course. Just not now. I'm tired. We begin our lessons tomorrow morning. That's enough now. George! George! Excuse me. George... You remember you invited me for breakfast? It's still early. - A friend is waiting for you, Mr. Collins. - Thanks. Two countrymen are too much for one breakfast. I'm sorry, Molly. Be patient. Bye. I know this part of the country well. - Is that so? - It's not the first time I'm here. I brought a special bottle of whiskey. I'd like to give it to you immediately. I believe the porters already brought the baggage into my room. When they send you a bottle of whiskey, it means you have to drink it. This contains the ciphered instructions. - Do you have that bottle of whiskey? - Of course. Wait here. I'll bring it immediately. Here you go. It's about Prof. Calvert. You know him, the scientist? Calvert? Yeah, I think so... You have quite a task bringing that old man back home, safe and sound. I'll supply you with the latest fashion trends. There's even a special vest. FBI brand. I went through all the courses. I'm familiar with those gadgets. Special tobacco. Time limit: 5 seconds after igniting it. Yes, I know it well. I just have to remember not to offer it to friends. Check your compass watch. As you can see, your compass has gone mad. It's a simple trick that can change the course of a plane or a boat. It could be of use to you. Interesting. One more thing, Collins. Meet me at 22:00 hours at the fishermen's hut 200 meters from here. It's over at the abandoned marina. I'll see you tonight. Tony... Jump in! Quickly! Go! It's a small world. But Saint Vincent is big and welcoming. And even more so now that you're here. Thank you. - What can I offer you? - Tea, as usual. Waiter! - Yes? - A tea for the Miss and whiskey for me. Now, where were we? Good evening, sir. - Whiskey, double, neat. - Coming right up. - May I pay in dollars? - Of course. Cinzanino, please. Thank you, sir. Hey, boy! Do you know Prof. Calvert? Yes, he's usually at the roulette wheel at this time. Thanks. 10 of one million, 30 of 100,000, 200 of 10,000, 300 of 2,000... ...10 of 500,000, 30 of 50,000, 200 of 5,000 and 300 of 1,000. It's all set. You aim well, Prof. Calvert. Your calculations are perfect. Perhaps this is another one of your inventions. And what are you doing here? Mr. Collins, your ploys are not enough to get rid of me. George, why did you leave without giving me a heads up? My job didn't allow it. You could've at least phoned me. Don't you think? I have to leave now, professor. I hope we'll meet again. Of course, my friend. It's always a pleasure talking to you. We'll speak again soon, then. Hi, dad. Allow me to present Mr. Andover. He's a friend I haven't seen since college. I wouldn't have even recognized him if he didn't tell me all those old stories. My daughter found a truly precious company. Thank you, Prof. Calvert. Pleased to meet you. - Shall we go to the night club? - Yes, dad. Go on. I'll catch up with you. As my aunt would say, "If you're about to fall in love, pack your bags before dawn!" My aunt also had a saying. "If a man leaves you, walk around the world until you find him, and then grab him!" "It's a matter of dignity." Allow me to present you a beautiful show. - Very entertaining. Right, Molly? - Yes, dear. You have to be in Ch√¢tillon at dawn. Does it have to be me who goes there? It's an order. Don't argue. Ladies and gentlemen! Casino Del Valle Nightclub is proud to present... The Nervis Ballet! No, no. Please, sit. Professor. No! No, George... I'm sorry. Thank you, Charles, for the lovely hours we spent together. I love you, Helen. Only now do I have the courage to say it. It's dawn. We should go back. - Let's stay just for a while longer. - No. You see, my father... Dad? Dad? Dad! Where are you, dad? Room 305, please. Andover? Is that you? My father isn't in his room. I'm really worried! Come to my room immediately! Please! What's wrong? You're finally here, Charles. - My father is gone. - Don't jump to conclusions. Calm down! Let's call the police, the hotel manager, anyone! Hello? Miss? Sorry, we made a mistake. Let's wait a moment and see what we can do. We have to do something. We mustn't waste any time, Charles. - Miss Calvert? - Who are you? A friend of the professor. And you are? I'm a friend, too. Please help me calm the young lady down. Her father has gone missing and we don't know what happened to him. - The telephone! - I'll answer it! Hello? What? All right. - I understand. - Who is it? We'll do as you say. Where? Don't be afraid, Helen. It's a ransom. They kidnapped your father and they want money. If we warn the police, they will kill him. They want to negotiate. What do you say? May I see it? I'll go talk to them. You can trust me. Okay. You'll go alone, Mr. Collins? How do you know my name? Anytime I come to a hotel, I keep myself apprised of any compatriots. It's a sentimental habit. Do you mind? No, not at all. We'll discuss it on another occasion. Welcome. Will you sit down, please? Please. You tried to get close to me the other night. You didn't succeed because of that girl. I regret that happened... because I really like you. Beautiful, isn't it? It's a strange way to express your feelings. Maybe it's better we talk about the money. Where is Calvert? I'm truly sorry I have to kill you, believe me. But I have to do it. Agent Collins makes too much noise while working. And the Calvert case needs all the discretion possible. We're in a foreign country. All of us. Just a second. I want to say something. You are delightfully sophisticated. A classy woman! You're so desirable... ...that it's a real joy to be alive! - What do you prefer? - Whiskey. No ice. There are weaknesses in life for which one pays dearly. Maybe this is one of them. There's no need to cry over what's been done. As you can see, I had 8 hours to kill you, but I didn't do it. I just couldn't. - Oh, George, finally. - I'm sorry, we'll do it some other time. I have really important engagements. Bye. This is for you, Mr. Collins. Here you go. George! - I'm sorry, I just wanted to say... - Later. I'll see you later. Get out and walk! Oh, it's you! - Who were you calling? - Let go of me! Hello? Hello?! You wanted to see me dead? Who is paying you? Tell me! Who is it? It was a setup, right? But it went badly, even for you! Don't be afraid. Relax. I don't like hitting pretty ladies. I just need some information. Just give me something and we'll be friends. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Olga Stefanova, you've been accused of high treason. By failing to kill the American, you've put our entire operation in jeopardy. I couldn't do it. What does that mean? You couldn't do it? Yet you were always capable of killing other men. Isn't that so? - I tell you again, I couldn't do it! - And I say you didn't want to! You had hundreds of ways to dispose of him. We know what you're capable of. Listen to me! I wanted to kill him! But I swear to you, it was impossible for me! He disarmed me! Everyone listened. You have sealed your fate with this lie, Olga Stefanova. You will be sent back home. No! No! No, not that! Let this be a warning to everyone. Professor Calvert... We don't intend to hurt you. And we don't want to know the secret of your latest discovery. But we can't allow other countries to make use of it. I am a free American citizen! You should kindly assist us and follow us from this moment on, Professor. And you will do so! An American who betrays his country! I'm not an American. I'm faithfully serving my true country. And now, Professor... You will call your daughter Helen. And tell her to get ready to go on a trip with some old friends of her father. No! Not my daughter! Leave her alone! She's still just a little girl. She has nothing to do with this. You can't do that! That depends on you, Prof. Calvert. It's either with or without your daughter. If you choose the latter, your daughter will 'disappear'. Get me Mrs. Calvert's room. Thanks. I'll call her back. We'll try calling her later. Think it through long and hard, Professor. Don't turn around. Walk. He's here. Here we go. Check it out. Professor Calvert! The American fell right into it! You're trapped, George Collins! Like a mouse! Now listen good. You'll die in exactly 8 minutes. That's the number of our men you've killed. 8 minutes to live and that's it! Damn it! That stubborn American! What does he think he's doing? He'll get blown up anyway. Insert the electric cell. X 1-7 calling Z-14. X 1-7 calling Z-14. Message received. Over. A message for you. Be quiet. Quiet. And don't move. That bastard managed to get out! Get down there! You stay here! Where is the Professor? Speak! He's in the tower. In the last room. Hurry! He's headed towards the Professor! I'm here to set you free. Come. Have faith in me, Professor. Don't shoot. We must get them back at any cost. But alive! Helen, my girl! Come. - My dear daddy! Are you hurt? - Helen! Hurry! We don't have time to waste! - And what are you doing here? - My job, dear colleague. Thanks for the help. You're an excellent agent. Base of operations speaking. FBI calling Collins. Can you hear me? Yes. Collins here. I'm listening. This is an emergency! You must reach the 104-kilometer marker on the west coast. Then board submarine USNS-702. Will do. Over. Mollie, take Helen and go to the airport. Okay. Collins calling 702. We're ready to board. We made it, Professor. Hold it! Welcome aboard the Pushkin. If the submarine follows the Polar route, circumnavigating Scandinavia... ...it will be impossible to take any action against it. If it were to take an unlikely route, like the Mediterranean, for example... ...we could use our sonars to locate them and follow them to their landing base. What if the submarine veers off in the Atlantic and for some reason approaches the U.S. coast? We have a plan for that as well. In that case our coastal security forces would catch sight of the submarine. And they could pinpoint its position. And we could force them to surface? Yes, but their captain would have to go mad or get thrown off course to make that move. Exactly. IF he got thrown off course! In fact, that's exactly what happened! And to think I was tasked with protecting you from the ladies. Another mission to accomplish. He never changes. Subtitles by Ant123 for CG June 2020
