--== McEphie ==-- [phones ringing] [traffic sounds] [alarm beeping] [water running] [Sid in Filipino] Who do you think you are, asshole? I ask myself that every night that I can't sleep. [Sid chuckles] I'm used to it. [in English] Causes of insomnia. Regret, self-blame, overthinking, anger, depression, loneliness, and... her. I love you. [chuckles] [Sid] No, this is not a love story. [in Filipino] An "I love you" doesn't always make a love story. Damn it, I don't even know how it started, or the middle or how it ended. [clicks tongue] [in Filipino and English] Let's just say there are bits and pieces of her. [in English] Memories. Dreams. You know, the kind you want to forget. [grunts] [in Filipino] Fuck it. How she managed to hurt me. [whispering in English] I love you. [in Filipino] My name is Luis Isidro Teodoro. [in English] I am a stockbroker. A job where every fucking single second counts. [in Filipino] Every second, someone wins, and someone loses. I make sure I'm always on the winning side of the bet. [in English] Darren... Darren is old money. Acts like old money. [in Filipino] Never had to work hard for anything, so he thinks he's a hardass. I'd sooner break his face. [man in English] Mr. J! [Sid in Filipino] This is Jerry. Just another asshole. [in English] Morning! [Sid in Filipino] The world's crawling with assholes. [Sid in English] Selling at 22 pesos per share. And we need at least half a million shares for it to move. For it to go up. Uh-huh. Yes, sir. Well, of course. Yes. If you'd ask me, there's no other time to buy but now. Okay, I've been doing the charts. All right? And let's say, give or take one or two years, I can double your money. At least 20 million, sir. I guarantee you. Yeah, of course. Is it a yes? All right, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is the best decision that you've made, sir. Thank you. Okay, then. Whoo! I'll see you Saturday. Saturday, 3:00 p.m. I'll see you, Jen. I love you. I love you, Jen. I love you. [in Filipino] Bro, not a word to Therese about this, okay? It's just a fling. What's great about Jen, dude... She's a bridesmaid at the wedding of Mr. Chang's daughter this Saturday. Mr. Chang? Is this the Mr. Chang who sells hopia and Peking duck? [in English] Yes, sir! [in Filipino] Mr. Chang, man. But the bride isn't a great beauty. Neither is the daughter nor the groom. The only thing that's great about them is their money. For my handsome and most successful godchild. Drink! Whoo! [Sid in English] Then there are people you don't really need. [in Filipino] This place is fancy. [Sid] People who pop out of nowhere, uninvited. I'll be here for two weeks. [Sid] Like my Uncle Rudy. Then I'll head right home. I'm glad you could make time for me. You're a busy man now, aren't you? The thing is, last time I saw you, that thing was still tiny. Still ripe for cutting. [chuckling] [Sid] No, you got it wrong, Uncle. The last time we saw each other was at my mother's funeral. I was eight years old. Then my gambling father followed shortly after. He just dragged me through high school and went ahead and hanged himself. I removed his dangling corpse myself. I untied the rope around his neck and all. You didn't let whatever happened to your parents stop you. That father of yours, Lito, was a spineless loser. George. Hold up. It's still early! One more round. One more round right here. Put it on my tab. Let's have one more round. What's the rush? Can you tell me about that business of yours with the stocks? Can you get me into that? Come on. I had some money saved up back in Florida. Just make it grow. About time I start sitting pretty, too. Do you think maybe 10 to 12 million will do? They're offering me land. But it's intended for farming. I'm sick of mud and dirt! I want to be wearing that suit, you know? This was on sale, Uncle. [Sid] Yeah, 'cause it's my job. Lay it down. Yes, it's a sure thing. [in English] Bye. Mr. Chang! Thank you for returning my call. Yeah, it's been a long time. [in Filipino] I need to be your broker. Of course, no other. -I can go to you any time tomorrow. -[doorbell rings] [in English] Yes, sir. [in Filipino] I'm free tomorrow just for you. [in English] I'll make myself available. Yeah, any time. Mmm-hmm. [in Filipino] All right. I do miss your delicious steamed buns. [in English] You know you should give me the keys to this place. Yes, sir. Seven o'clock. Okay. Really? You want to live here? Isn't that against your rules? I can bend the rules. [Sid] In this business, you are what you ride. Who you ride. Who you fucking ride. [in Filipino] Who has never felt lonely? -[elevator dings] -[Sid] Who isn't mad at the world? Damn, we all are! In a snap, in just one push, one can simply explode. We all have our own brand of insanity. It just depends on how you disguise it. [man] I think he may be a doctor. No. He can't be a doctor. Doctors are always exhausted. They wouldn't be out of bed. That guy hangs around here in the dead of night. Maybe he gets really hungry at odd hours. He's got worms. Worms? With a good-looking face like that? So what? Worms are worms. They don't care how good you look. Stupid, he's way too big now to be getting worms. Oh, yeah. He's a big boy. He's got to be an attorney. See how he's always reading? He's working on a case. [Aya] No, no. I bet you he's a businessman. He's got on a nice suit when he drops by in the morning. So how much are we talking? Come on. I'll do it. [in English] Game? [in Filipino] Fine. Twenty pesos. The fuck do you think this is? [in English] 150. [in Filipino] Fifty from each of us. Money down. Double it, will you? It's not easy what I'm about to do. I'm going to approach some complete stranger. He might punch me. [man] Go ahead. Let's have it. Go on. Game. -Sir? -Hmm? -You're done with this? -Hmm. Why, sir, it would be such a waste. So many people are going hungry. Please wrap it to go. Okay, sir. Oh! Oh! [laughs] Are you okay? Yes, Doc. I'm fine. Sorry, I just got a little dizzy. I apologize. I'm anemic. Okay. I'm not a doctor. [Aya] Uh... You're not a doctor? Attorney? [Sid in English] No. [in Filipino] You're not an attorney either? So businessman? [in English] Sort of. Sort of? [in Filipino] That's as good as a yes. I'll wrap this up for you, sir. Fuck you! What did you tell my client? -What did you say to Mr. Chang? -Stop him! What did you say to my client? [Sid] Serves you right for being a moron! You're calling me a moron? I thought you were my friend! [overlapping chatter] [in English] What a show! What a show! Always be closing? Right, Sid? Yes, sir. [chuckles] Market's bullish. You're way beyond your quota. Everything's turning good for you. [in Filipino] You don't have to kiss my ass, boss. [in English] Well, you're my top gun. I like kissing shiny asses. Guevarra Coal. [in Filipino] Find out who he's selling to. [in English] Make sure we're betting on the right place. [grunting] [laughing] [Dani in Filipino] You stole Jerry's client? [in English] I just thought he was your friend. This is really good. You should eat. Biscoff wants me in Rio. Says he's not confident with our pitch. [in Filipino] He's wanted you for so long. [in English] Fuck you. Later. [in Filipino] Jealousy doesn't suit you. [cell phone ringing] Hmm... [in English] Excuse me. Hello? Yes, Biscoff. I'm still in the middle of something. What's the problem? You still need what? [knocking on glass] I love you. [chuckles] [Sid in Filipino] Aya. I'm not interested in getting to know people I don't need. Before that night, I had no use for her. See those two? There. The queer one is Gabe. He's mad about you. Thinks you're super cute. Actually, we all do. You're our favorite customer. That's why we made a bet. Whoever gets to tell you "I love you" first wins. How much did you win? Just 300 pesos. Had I known you'd even talk to me, I would have got it up to 500. That time you pretended to be dizzy, was that a bet too? You remember! What can I say? Cash is cash. I'm Aya, by the way. And you are? I just asked for your name, not "What is Life?" Sid. Sid. [in English] Okay. [in Filipino] Don't I get an "I love you too"? [both laughing] Did that tickle you? You know, you should try that more. Smile like that. It suits you. Early in the morning, you've got a deep frown going. Aren't you scared of that? This? [smirks] Not in the least. Why? Are you scared? Like it? Actually, most desirable things are forbidden. Why? Have you done many forbidden things? [laughing] I can't say. You might get the police on my tail. No. You're new here, aren't you? A little over a month, maybe. Those two tell me you're always around during these hours. I've been living around here for almost a year. Ever since my condo got turned over to me. The one over there? You're loaded. One more for the road? Yeah. I'll just say goodbye to those two. Then I'll be on my way. Thanks for the income. [Sid] I don't know why I did it. Maybe because she was pretty, a great talker. Maybe I saw a bit of myself in her. Hey. [Sid in English] That shit my psychiatrist would probably say. [chuckles] [in Filipino] I don't know. Something just came over me. How much should I pay you for the whole night? What? I'm not some whore, all right? Sorry, that's not what I meant. I only mean to pay you to keep me company, say, for three hours. To do what? -I don't know. -Out with it. What else do men and women do at this hour but have sex? No. We're not going to have sex. I cannot sleep. I just need someone to talk to. Wouldn't you like some extra income? If you try anything weird on me, Gabe will come after your ass. Let's hear your offer again. Just so we're clear. [in English] One thousand an hour. [in Filipino] Whoa. You must be really sad to have to pay someone to talk to you. You know, alcohol will knock you out, but only for a little while. You should be drinking something like milk. At least you'll sleep like a baby. I read something about insomniacs. The reason why they can't sleep is because they've got a million things on their minds. I'm no stranger to long hours myself. If you recall, I used to be a call center agent. I took the night shift. That's where I met my ex. He was our team leader. Naturally, when I got fired, we broke up. So what now? Is it part of my job to be the only one talking? What is it that you do? Why are you so rich? What kind of business are you in? [in English] I'm a stockbroker. [in Filipino] I work over at DS Capital. [in English] It's an investment company. So what I do is, I convince people to invest on industries such as telco, food, technology. [in Filipino] That's where they'll invest their wealth. [in English] Lots of big deals, lots of shaking of hands, people to please. You know, you should stop smoking. Because the things that we love will eventually kill us. [in Filipino] We all die, and that's that. It makes no difference. [in English] Hey, miss. [in Filipino] Are you alone? What's it to you? I'll keep you company. [in English] Buy you a drink. [man grunting] [in Filipino] Know what I'm doing to you? One prick here and here, and you'll be on the floor. Asshole. The pervert. So you're not loyal to your girlfriend. What? What did I do? What do you think? [in English] You're judging me. Look. [in Filipino] I don't know you. I'm paying you to keep me company. Why don't you ask that girl instead? Are you affected? Not me. The reason why you're with me and not her is because you'd have to pay her something worse, some hope for romance. [in English] Bad for business. [in Filipino] You're one to talk. Why did your ex break up with you? He didn't break up with me. I ended it. I'm asking why. It is what it is. I felt him grow cold. I just beat him to the punch. What, you don't believe me? That's just how it works. Serve or get served. So you just have a feel for it, huh? [scoffs] That's how I roll. If it's time to bounce, you bounce. No matter how intense the love, you surrender to someone. That dance requires two people. You can't do it alone. If I see my lover unhappy around me, I release him! You shouldn't keep a heart caged, you know. Jeez. What am I saying? I'm so loud! Get me a beer! You really bring that much money? Mmm-hmm. [in English] On a daily basis. [in Filipino] I've got things to fix, to pay, to buy. That's just me. I'm a bad person. I'm a crook. I fuck people over. If you're like that, forget about ever getting any sleep. Better resign. [in English] Resign? [in Filipino] Fine. I'll resign, and you quit. Deal? This is my lung. You, it's people you mess with. What about you? Do you get into just about anything that pays you cold cash? If I have the hots for them. [in English] Joke. [in Filipino] You and me, we're just alike. Probably you're just a tad worse. Thanks. [in English] Miss. Excuse me. Sir. Oh. [chuckles] [in Filipino] What are you doing here? I work here. [in English] Part-timer. Yes, sir. How can I help you, sir? Pick up? Huh? [in Filipino] Are you here for a pick-up? Not me, okay? Oh, no. Of course not. You see, I sent in some laundry the other day. Usually, they deliver the clothes to my unit, but I don't know why they couldn't make it today. Oh, my bad. I haven't had enough sleep. You should have called. That's true. Well, I did call. But I guess a certain sleeping lady at the shop couldn't possibly hear the ringing. Give me that. "Luis Isidro Teodoro." So "Sid" was lifted from "Isidro," huh? You really wrote down your full name. -[whirring] -Hurry up. I'm on it. Is this it? [in English] Joke. [in Filipino] Here they are. These three. They all look the same. All right. I'll go ahead. Don't! Somebody loves you, sir. [in English] Joke. Huh? [in Filipino] It means don't move on to the next life just yet. It's a joke. Jeez. -Fine, fine. Be on your way. -Okay. -Okay. Whatever. -[in English] Okay, bye! Yeah. Thank you. BOSS, 11PM WITH GUEVARRA I'll keep you posted, Boss [Sid in Filipino] Guevarra had a meeting with San Agustin's son. Congressman Martin's son was with them too. I know those two. Cunning sons of bitches. [in English] Now, if we base it on what we hear on the news and the market trend and from what I saw last night, [in Filipino] this only means one thing. [in English] These people are up to something. I think that they are about to merge their assets. [in Filipino] When that happens, their companies become impervious to all pressure from the government to have their coal-fired powerplants shut down. [in English] If that happens, [in Filipino] what else can the protesters hope to accomplish? [in English] Fucking protesters. [in Filipino] Don't they tire of it all? [in English] The strong will always prey on the weak. Nothing is ever fair. That's the system. Hard truth. Well, for some people, what can we do but follow our nature? [in Filipino] What about you? [in English] What are you born with, Sid? You're betting their stocks to go up? [chuckling] All or fucking nothing, sir. "Fucking"! [in Filipino] If you're right, then I'll tell Pops to lend you a share. [in English] You'll become a winner. [in Filipino] I'm sorry. We don't give out our employees' numbers to just about anyone. [in English] I know. [in Filipino] I'm a friend of Aya's. You? A friend of Aya? Is it hard to believe? See here. That guy knows me. Hey, Gabe! This man claims to be Aya's friend. Yeah. He is. -[in English] Hi, Sid. -[in English] Hi, Gabe. [in Filipino] Where's Aya? [chattering] [in English] Hello, guys! This place is so wonderful, isn't it? And this will become more wonderful to you. Whoa! This place is amazingly perfect! Is it... Is it going to rain? It's strange, huh? [playing flute] [Aya singing indistinctly] [gasps] Hey, lady! Bring back my flute! Hey! Please! [Aya in Filipino] What brings you here, Mr. Big Time? I wanted to share some news with you. I've been made partner. I mean, not just a partner. I'm now part-owner of the company. [in English] You're welcome. -[in Filipino] Great, huh? -[in Filipino] Why? Why? [in English] Well, for one, I deserve it. [in Filipino] Also, I managed to sniff out a sweet deal for the company. So the bigshot you used to know just got bigger. That's all there is to it. -The thing's starting in 15 minutes. -Yes, I know. Why are you telling me? Am I your girlfriend now? Popping in during my work hours, too. Such a bother. Where's your girlfriend anyway? [in English] Out of the country. [in Filipino] There we go. That's how it is. You dickhead. Why won't you just admit it? You're a serial womanizer. You really don't have any friends, do you? Fine. We can be friends. But I'll increase my rate to 1,500 per hour. And if I go beyond three hours, that's a different rate. And I'm still not having sex with you. [in English] Done. Game. [in Filipino] You're sick in the head. [in English] What? [in Filipino] Later! [Aya] Yes! I'll send it tomorrow. You can go pick it up. Better go in the afternoon 'cause I might sleep in. [woman] 10,000 pesos, including wi-fi. Prepaid cuts off calls with Mama. Yes! What about Papa? [woman] He's okay. He's eating now. Tell him to stop being stubborn. I'm breaking my back out here, and he's putting my money down the drain each time he ends up in the hospital. And tell JR I saw him on Facebook doing nothing but hanging out with his damn posse. [in English] Bye! [people screaming] -[in Filipino] So what's your goal? -[in Filipino] Me? How rich do you plan to become? How rich do I... Well... [in English] Ten? One hundred million more? One hundred million? [in Filipino] Did you know that only 1% of all the world's population [in English] owns just a little over 50% of the world's wealth? -At 7.5 billion people on earth... -[in Filipino] You know what? Forget it! Forget it. Never mind those percentages. I'm well aware of all that. I live and breathe the reality every day. Life sucks when you're poor. [in English] Period. [in Filipino] As for me, if I save up enough money, I'll follow my mom and go to Japan. Japan? Your mother works in Japan? Mmm-hmm. That's why we never run out of Kit Kat Green and instant noodles. [chuckling] My mom was a Japayuki back when that job trend was in full swing. She used to come and go. On her last trip, I was about 12 years old. So that makes it 18 years now that she hasn't come home. Do you plan on working there too? Perhaps. I mean I could try. All I really want is to send her back home with us. I could maybe work there for two years, then convince her to come home with me. We need her, not her gifts. Impressive. Fighter. Both fists raised in front of the face at all times. The lead hand for jabbing and the rear hand for defense. That's the motto I live by these days. [Aya] Your head's in the clouds. [Sid] No, I was just thinking about black swans. [in English] Black swan? [in Filipino] As in little black ducks? No! Those are pretty tasty. In Pateros. -Let's go. Want to try? -No, no. That's not it. It's different. I mean a black swan. Uh... How can I explain it? Go ahead, sir. I catch on quick. [in English] All right, so... A black swan is a... It's a term coined by Taleb. He was a trader. [in Filipino] Uh... He used to be a trader. A stock trader like me. According to him, the world believed for a time that there are only white swans until one person saw a black swan, which meant that, all this time, everything we've come to know might be false because nobody's ever seen a black swan before. So Taleb uses the term "black swan" for random events that happen unexpectedly and impact the world with drastic consequences. For example, 9/11 in New York. Smartphones, right? Internet, social media. [in English] So the world is getting bigger and smaller. [in Filipino] It's my job to keep an eye out for those important turn of events. Only then can I bet wisely. Like love. -What's love got to with it? -[laughing] [in English] Joke. [in Filipino] I get it. I get it. I do! -You get it? -Yes, I do. Why? What? This is good. [upbeat song playing in English] [Aya] Good morning, sir. Good morning. [in Filipino] "Sir," my ass. Okay. [in English] So... [in Filipino] You know what to do. Same as usual. -Yes. -We good? -Yes, sir. -Sure? -[in English] Yes. -[in English] Okay. -[in Filipino] Bye! -[in Filipino] You got it. [in English] Yes. Two steak dinners. Red wine. [cell phone ringing] Hello? [in Filipino] Hey. What are you up to? Just rummaging through your life. Why did you call? You're bothering me at work. Uh... No reason. Stuck in traffic. [in English] Hello, Aya? Good evening, sir. Special delivery. Come in. [glasses clinking] [in Filipino] Do you plan on dying tonight? You're all set for a heart attack with all that food you ordered. I've been craving it since the other day. That will be 2,000 pesos. [in English] Two thousand. Plus service charge, you know. Okay. Done. [in Filipino] Are you sure your girlfriend's fine with me being here? Yes. Dani's not the jealous type. [in English] She can do whatever she wants. Same for me. Important thing is, [in English] at the end of the day, [in Filipino] we come back to each other. Something like that. You know what I mean? Whatever goes. -Sounds cool. -Isn't it? Might try it sometime. But I think it takes a certain kind of heart to put up with that. She told me she wants to move in. I said, "Sure, no problem." [in English] I don't mind having kids. [in Filipino] I can even imagine the little squirts running around here. Pretty picture you're painting. [in English] Remember "black swan"? [in Filipino] An unexpected event that changes everything. Nothing is for certain. Drink up. Drink your beer while it's ice cold. Come on. Never mind the time. I got you. Fine, I'll sweeten the deal. I'll add 10,000 pesos. 10,000 for you to stay till sun up. You're really going to throw away hard-earned cash on someone like me? I am not throwing away my cash. [in English] I have money to spend, and you're a sound investment. [in Filipino] So... Doesn't sound like a waste to me. What? I pay my psychiatrist a fortune, and he's done jack squat for me. I'll stick with you. Why don't you just admit that you're not happy? [in English] Penalty. Penalty! Huh? You're judging me. [in Filipino] We had a deal. [in English] That's minus 10%. [in Filipino] Telling the truth is far from being judgmental. [in English] Okay. Fine. [in Filipino] You want to tell the truth. Here's what we're going to do. From now on, we say nothing but the truth to each other. -Game. -Game? Why did you come here? For money. Really now. Why are you here? Money. Why? I told you. I need 100,000 pesos. I need it for my bank statement for my visa, so the Japanese can let me be a tourist in the country. Uh... They're not giving out talent visas anymore. Damn, talent's all I got. So, now, can you give me what I need? [in English] Then you'll have to work for it. Call. Sir. [in Filipino] You ran out of beer. Wow. It's so high. -[Aya screaming] -Hey! [Aya laughs] It's your turn to tell a truth. -Anything. -Anything? As long as it's true. Hmm... [Sid in English] The truth is, I wanted her that night. [in Filipino] But I didn't want to blow this thing with her. At least I didn't mean to. She felt no awkwardness. She thought he was only sleepwalking. But the situation has changed. She realized he hasn't been sleepwalking towards her bedroom, but, rather, he meant to sleep beside her and hold her in his arms. Psst. What's that? [in English] Condom. [in Filipino] I know it's a condom. Why are you staring at it? This is Sid's. Wow. That guy strikes anywhere. Hey, missy. Don't you get your nose stuck in somebody else's business. Good luck finding it in the end. My nose hasn't gone anywhere. You've gone and buried it. Haven't you? "Sure! No problem!" said Racquel. [woman speaking indistinctly over phone] All right, Ma. I'll take care of Papa. [sighs] [crying] That'll kill me. I've been looking at you for a while. You were making this face. This is nothing. My ma, my pa. My whole family. Life. Cash. I thought you said you're all about fists raised in front of your face, one for defense, the other for punching. I'm fine. I can take this. Tears just fall quicker when you're dead on your feet. How long is your shift tonight? Can you close up early? Of course. Watch me. [in English] That's my girl. ["When I See You" playing] [sighs] [Aya] Shit! [indistinct] [Aya screaming] [whispering] I love you. [in Filipino] We've never extended this privilege to anybody outside the family. [in English] Fifteen percent of the company. [in Filipino] What's up? What are the cakes for? I have money to spend. Mmm... You finally had sex with the businessman! You hit the jackpot, mate. Look at you, pretty woman! I'm all giddy. You're overreacting. Was he yummy? Mmm-hmm. Frankfurter or Bratwurst? Answer. -Vienna... -Sir! She's changing the topic. -So is it big? -[cell phone ringing] [in English] Tell me when to stop. [in Filipino] Wait. I have a call. Hello. Hey, Lisa. Hello, Aya! Papa just collapsed! What? So bring him to the hospital. This is money I owe. I'll pay you. That damn hospital won't attend to my dad unless there's a cash deposit. Sorry, it's not much. Thank you. [doorbell ringing] [in English] Surprise! [giggles] [in Filipino] I didn't bother to call. [in English] Darren already told me. Congrats, babe! Come on. I missed you! Yeah. [Dani] You know what's interesting? I already found a buyer for my place. So I'm thinking maybe I should move in? [in Filipino] Like that idea? [in English] We can have this place renovated. Add more color. You think that's something we should start considering? Yeah. Sure. [Dani] Okay. [indistinct] [in Filipino] Dani's back. How are you? I'm good. [in English] Yeah. I was hoping you'd say that. I'm sorry. [in Filipino] Don't be silly. You don't have to say sorry. I know what I'm doing. I wanted this. We're still friends, aren't we? Sure! Your meter's running. It's almost an hour. [in English] I'm thinking maybe I should... Maybe I should propose to her already. [in Filipino] That's where it's headed anyway, right? [in English] Wow. Good luck. [in Filipino] I'm glad you're finally betting on love. [in English] Love? Mmm... Love. [in Filipino] You think it's love? If it's not for love, it's too big a risk to take. Let's go. [in English] Would you like to try it on, ma'am? [in Filipino] It's not for me. Go ahead. [in English] Yeah. Try it on. [in Filipino] You and Dani are the same size. [in English] Ma'am? [in Filipino] It suits you. Would you like to have it instead? Asshole. [sighs] Don't worry. It'll come off later. So are you still going to Japan? And why not? I've worked hard for it. The truth is, I'm all set and saved up. I can apply for the visa tomorrow. [in English] How much... I mean... If I ask you to stay for one more night, how much? Game? [crying] [sighs heavily] [elevator dings] [in Filipino] Uncle? How did we lose? You said it was a sure thing. Fuck... That was my life. You bastard! You're just like your father. Son of a gun. Asshole. [Filipino song playing] [Sid] This is Aya's punishment. More questions. [grunts] More sleepless nights. [all cheering] [in English] Drinks are on me, boys! Drinks are on me! It's all about the money! Guys, guys, guys! Our biggest earner! Come here, you asshole! My new partner in crime, Sid! To the best fucker I know. And I mean that literally! [whooping] [grunting] [grunting] Fuck! [Sid in Filipino] My black swan turned out to be this one girl. This one girl who I never thought could change everything. Take care now. [Sid] There were many things I couldn't tell her. Many more I wish I could say now... if she would listen. [in English] Fuck. If she was with me, I would tell her I love her. [in Filipino] I'd be a fool not to admit it to myself. I hurt her because I'm scared of myself around her. You have something more to add to this? I'll be sending it out tomorrow. No, Ma. It's full. That's more than enough. I'm just making sure. It might not be enough for Lisa's baby. [in Japanese] I have to go now. The kids are expecting me. Oh, yes. I'll be back next month. I'll be busy, but I'll check if I can leave for a day or two. Certainly. I'll always be waiting. Okay. I'll see you. -You look perfect. -Thank you. Go on. Aya, take care of your mother. Yes. Don't worry about me! Take care. -Bye. Take care. -See you. -[in English] Bye! -[in English] Bye! -I love you. -[man chuckles] [door closes] [in Filipino] Sorry! -What do you want? -What? Are you having me arrested? Why are you running away? I'm not legally supposed to be here. I'm not throwing you in jail. Jeez! Then what? Is this about the ring? I'm sorry, all right? I just really needed the money. My father had a stroke. But I'll pay you. Besides, that's change for you. You don't need the money. But don't worry. I'll pay you back. Not now, I don't know how, but I will. What? What's so funny? Nothing! What? Nothing. I've got work. I'm leaving. Wait, wait, wait. [in English] Okay. [in Filipino] I'm here for work too, but... Where do you work? How are you? What's up? Let's talk or something. After work, are you free? I'll message you. I'll message you. You'll message me. How are you going to do that? You're not even answering calls. Have you changed your number? Wait. Come on. So? There. I gotta get to work. [cell phone ringing] -Hello? -It's me. Just making sure. Don't forget. You owe me. So don't stand me up. Is it just me? [in English] Joke. [in Filipino] I'll message you later. [instrumental music playing] [people clamoring] [club music playing] [announcer in English] Are you ready? [in Filipino] Go ahead. Drink up. Or can you just subtract it from my tab? How are you? You're asking me? I'm great! Japan is really straightforward. You keep the Japanese happy, make them laugh, get them drunk. They're serious about work here. That's why they get pretty stressed out. It's a simple thing! Much like the work I did for you back then. Have I told you? My mother used to work right in this very establishment. [in English] Like mother, like daughter. [in Filipino] Your face... What, the ring? You know what? I really mean to pay you back. Or can I just not? I have so many bills to pay. You remember my sister Lisa? She went and got herself pregnant. Couldn't finish school. So I told her, after she gives birth, she better go back to finish it. Aya. Can we go outside, maybe someplace quiet where we can talk? ["Heartbeats" playing] Aya, forgive me. I know I hurt you. [in Japanese] Please stop here. [in Filipino] Come on. Let's go. Never mind that. It's all good. That's over with. [Sid] Okay, so I told him, [in English] "Fuck you, Darren, you piece of fuck!" I'm gonna put up my own firm. [in Filipino] That's what I said, and then he walked out. Because we're into impact investments concentrating on renewable energy, [in English] this is going to be big back in the Philippines. All right? [in Filipino] You okay? [in English] Am I boring you with this shit? Shh. [in Filipino] Just quiet down a little. Okay, so here it goes. [Aya] You've been a little dazed. What are you looking at? [in English] My father taught me how to read faces. [in Filipino] He's the one who got me into gambling. He said, "You can look at a person's face and find out the cards they hold close." So do you think I hold the ace now? I only know you play well. You know, when I first came here, I did not feel lonely. It felt like I got out of something 'cause, here, it's okay to be alone. They don't care if you are. I didn't know that was possible. To be so free of burdens. Not for long. I felt guilty. My mother is here. She's the reason I came here. For Lisa, for my other siblings, for Papa. So that, someday, we'll want for nothing. But we're far from okay. It always seems like everything we need is so far and out of reach. [sighs] It's exhausting. I'm tired of loving people I need to love. [in English] My father, he died a poor man. [in Filipino] But, worse than that, he died unhappy. So I told myself I would never be like him. If you lived your life for others, I lived mine for no reason. I've never held anything quite so dear. [in English] Not until now. [whispering] I love you. [Sid] So I'm leaving tomorrow. [in Filipino] Come with me. [laughs] Don't be like that, or I just might. Come with me. Come with me. I'm not kidding. What is this? Are we to elope? Hmm. Something like that. No, here's what we're going to do. Let's just meet here again this afternoon. [in English] At 4:00? Game? -Game. -Game. -[in Filipino] Here, 4:00 p.m. -[in English] 4:00 p.m. [in Filipino] Won't you bet on me this time, Aya? If I do, it'll be your turn to get your heart broken. [in English] Joke! [both laughing] [in Filipino] You got me going there for a second. -Okay, I'll head off. -Okay. [in English] See you! [in Filipino] I go here. 4:00 p.m., all right? Sid! -It's okay. You can have it! -No! -It's fine! -No, take it. I'm not cold. [in English] Hello, Ms. Japan! [laughs] -[in Filipino] Okay. -[in Filipino] Okay. Bye! [Aya] Ma? Ma? I didn't hear you come in. Lisa just called. Checking on us. Your father wants to talk to you. Okay, Ma. Do you have work later? No, I don't. Come with me. Let's go shopping. Okay, Ma. Have you had breakfast? Want me to whip something up? It's fine, Ma. Go on and call your father then. He's been waiting for you. [door closes] Should I buy the Louis Vuitton now? I might dream about it! Why don't you sleep on it for now, Ma? It's expensive. Expensive? What do you mean? Of course, a Vuitton isn't cheap. What do you think of that bag? How much do you think I had to pay for that? You got this from Don Quijote. How dare you! It's still not cheap there! Ma, isn't that Wataru? [in Japanese] Wataru! Wataru! Wataru! Wataru! Does this one look good on me? Yes, it looks nice. Buy me this one, won't you? Okay. [both continue speaking in Japanese] I wanted a black one. Can I have this? Of course, you can. [in Filipino] Let's buy that Louis Vuitton. Hurry up! Ma. What? You think I wasn't ready for that? Do you think I'm stupid? Ma, I get it. I'm just checking if you're okay. Of course, I'm not okay. But I need to be okay. Do you understand me? I know what you were trying to do. You're trying to get me to go back home. Don't you know how difficult that is for me? At my age, you're going to force me home? I've forgotten how it is to live in the Philippines. I love you. I still love your father. [crying] But I also love Wataru. How's that? Can't I just love all of you? Isn't that possible? [in English] So it's the real thing now, huh? You said you liked this writer, so I'm giving you this. Consider it a thank-you gift for a job well done. Have you read it? -Thank you, Mr. Anderson. -Thank you so much. -Thank you so much, Mr. Nakata. -[in Japanese] Thank you so much. [in English] Thank you. [in Filipino] Uncle, get a bottle ready. We're going to celebrate. Yes. [in English] Success. See you. [phone line ringing] [cell phone ringing] [in Filipino] Aya! What are you doing there? Let's take some pictures! [indistinct] [Filipino song playing] [Sid] How many risks do I take to win someone like Aya? [in English] I did not deserve her. But still I had her. [in Filipino] I hope, one day, it happens to you. After all, we're all hurting anyway. [indistinct] [in English] Hi. Hi. ["Heartbeats" playing]
