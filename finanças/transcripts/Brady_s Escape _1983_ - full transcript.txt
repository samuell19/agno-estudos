I do not really know where we are. You are in Hungary, this place is called Hortobagy... It is the largest plain of Europe. Villages are very distant. The Germans are our allies. You are allies? But we are occupied. Do you understand? Leave him, please... I addressed his wound, and I gave him morphine... Go out, please. (Go out with him!) My friend in there, what do you think? How do you think he is gonna do? He will die unless we can get him to a place where he can be cared for... Do you think he will live? I am not sure... But my father and I will try everything... How is it going, Sweet?. The pain's gone... It doesn't look good, Brady! Here, eat! No, my boy... Don't do that! Out! Line up! Ready the weapons! Search everywhere! Tell him to let the dogs out! Let the dogs out! I would be happy to do so... ...but these are Kuvasz dogs ...they will kill straight away! He said they are too dangerous. They are killers. Go back! Watch out for horses... Move back! Nix Germans. They left. He looked at you, father! I can still feel that he is watching us. Cut through the field! - Stop. Stop. - Whoa... I think he is dead. You must return to the horse ranch. The horsemen will hide you until we can arrange an escape for you from Debrecen. - Are you doing this for me?.. - Yes. Why? You are in trouble... And you need help... And what is Debrecen? It's the nearest large town. If I can just get close to the Russian lines... No, no. Escape must be carefully planned. Please believe me and trust us. You will need papers. And you must learn some Hungarian. Now, that will be a task, won't it? My daughter is a teacher. She will help you. That part I like. If you are gonna be my teacher, you might just as call me J. W. Brady. Take it. How do I say "Thank you?" "Koszonom" "Koszonom" She will be your friend forever. From today, you will ride her..

Ha-ha! Let me go, cowboy! Lay down!. Lay down!. That's it. Lay down! Lay down! Stay down... Good job, Brady! Where are you going? Why are you going this way? I hope he wasn't rude?

Ha, cowboy-song... - Oh, Susannah!... - Out!... I am sorry, he is just a kid, you know... I must get back... I have something to tell you, Brady... I may be observed... Not quite sure, but I think it is best to come at night. This farm is no longer safe. You must change your hiding place! If there is any worries for you, I don't want you to come back... I will manage. I will send you a message... Halt! Come on... Get going... Move, I say! Bring them out! Safrany Gergely. Old man... I want you to look at him. This is a Russian pilot. He was a pilot... We found him hiding in the old man's barn. You'd better be careful, old hairy one... I have another dog, still. Next! From Miss Clara?... She says she want us to meet in a little village called Ohar. - You know where that is? - (Yes). - What else? - She said we should come tonight. Last night it rained. 'Mult ejjel esett az eso.' - 'Mult'... - 'Mult'... 'Mult... ejjel,... esett' 'Esett'... - 'Az eso'... - 'Az eso'... 'Mult ejjel esett az eso?.' - 'Mult'... - No, 'Mult, muuu'...

'Milyen... messze... van a varos'... - 'Milyen messze van a varos?' - 'Milyen messze van a varos?' He is a liar! Search every single farm! I want you to know - my instincts are better than all your soldiers! Let's go! Come on, come on, come on... Come on, come on. Come to me... Come to me... - She runs pretty fast! - Aranka likes you, Brady. What if she is just afraid? No, no... She wants to play. I have never seen anything like it. Brady... What's it like? In America?.. Tell me... Well... It's a wide country. One, two, three ranges long. And how far on horse? About a whole summer ride. That is far. It is decorated with... Hard wood and pines on the top and, and you go down south - and you got like coconuts and palms... And you move a bit and there is a big river - the Mississippi. - Mississippi? - Yes, close enough... Cross that, move further to the west... You hit the plains, like the Hortob?gy... And you ride and ride and ride... Until you get to the canyons... Somewhere mile-deep... And you go up to the mountains... Mountains so high... There is snow on top all year. And then you go up, to the Garden Spa of the Wood. - Green River, Wyoming. - Wyoming? Wyoming. And they got, the grass to feed your cattle, your horses... water... calme. surrounded by mountains. And its peaceful there. No Nazis? No bombs? No. That's where I wanna live in the long run. I go to Wyoming. Yeah... You would be my ranch-hand! - I will go with you. - And how would your family feel about that? - Family? - Yeah, your father and your mother. No family... Father in Russia... Mom died in the bombing. Well, who raised you? Csorba... Moro... Csege and all the others. We are just a couple of cowboys, you and me. Okay... cowboy. Yeah. Teacher doesn't look happy. Lessons are over. It's time to say "goodbye." You will leave for Tokaj tomorrow. It has been arranged... four men will take you past to the Russians. And there to look for a man. - ...called Istvan Varju. - Tomorrow? Yes. - No more lessons? - No. Are you not glad? Yeah. I'm going. Yes and no... Yes and no... From Aranka's mane, It's a work of art... It's beautiful. - You made it? - Yep. An indian bracelet. Dear Brady, stay here. I'll come back. Yes... I believe... You'll find me... I have bad news. The Germans blocked every ways out. The professor says, that the Germans are close... And they had blocked all the passes. They have mobilized great forces. It is impossible to get through to the Russians. You cannot get to the Russians. My advice is not to try crossing now. Then can we just spend here some hours tonight? I am very sorry about that, but you can try to go towards the south. He says that he is sorry... but there is another way. - Another way? - To the south. The German control is not so bad on the south, although it is still risky of course Trust yourself! You are the friend of Dr. Dusek! We have a radio transmitter! There is a radio transmitter. In one of the cellars. I use the Morse-code to reach a man in Zombor. He has connections to the partisans of Tito. He says he can... contact you with Tito's partisans. And they will get you to Yugoslavia. If you can cross the river at Szeged you are a free man! If you cross the river at Szeged you are free. "Tell me, Mary-Anne want to be my wife? I'll give you a little bit of... For the rest of all your life. No, go away, nasty man... Please don't treat me so... I gave you a little bit of... half an hour ago... " There is still a long way for you to go. I hope that riding will sober him up. You will get papers from the doctor. He must get to Szeged by train. Klara will travel with him as his wife. A man will be waiting on the other side of the Tisza. He will be carrying a birdcage. He'll take him to the partisans, but he must get there within a week. They will wait for him every day for a week. That's the only way. Did you see the paratroopers? I was out there with the herd... I didn't see anyone. There are no strangers there. What's going on? He says: "He remembers the plane falling but he has seen no parachuters." I dont think these people will be of much help. We are going to find them! Klara Tomorrow morning. At the train station. Klara tomorrow morning at the train station. Me and Aranka we come to see you off. It is too dangerous. It does not matter. - Hey, you're next! - Me? Yeah. Mikl?s, too... Two to Szeged. Good Day, my lady! Guard him closely! - Which is the American? - That one. You go back. Tell her, you managed to get time for me to leave. Now. Now! Go on! That'll be good. Let's continue, doctor... I do not know this Brady. I don't know where he is. Once I was called to the Puszta... to see a horseman, but his name was not Brad... And you? I was just waiting for my brother at the station. He was just waiting for his brother... at the station. The doctor asked me to bring the messages. Csorba and the horsemen hid the American. Brady is out on the Puszta. I will bring Captain Brady here within 24 hours. You will all meet in front of the firing squad. Captain Brady! I have a message... from the Doctor. Good news to Brady. From the doctor. I have a message from the doctor! Aranka... Aranka... It's over, Captain Brady! You bombed Dresden. My mother and sister died killed there. I going to kill every American pilots I can lay my hands on. You won't escape, Brady! I will be back before dark with my men. Ride, Aranka... That's the way. You go! You go... Look, Aranka! Something must have happened with Brady. Let's go! Aranka... She's found you, by God! She's found me! Brady, what happened? Are you all right? The bullet went through. You are a lucky man! He won't wait till morning He'll come back. - We have to get off the Hortobagy. - Right!... you must go! - I will go, too! - This is a war! - And it's dangerous. - I am a man! I'm going with you to Yugoslavia, and Wyoming Good job, Aranka! Damn! Lock it up! We have a long day ahead. To Szeged? Yeah, we gotta cross that wild river. And then Yugoslavia... If we are fortunate even further to Italy... - Then Wyoming? - Aha. What happenes if they won't let Hungarian kids into Italy? Then I will have to talk to... - ... ranch boss. - Who is that? Mark Clark, the General. I will have to say, "General, I know that kid... deserves a medal... Nah... - They don't give medals to kids. - You don't think so? Stand up! Stand in attention! And put your hands to your side. In the name of America's Aerial Force... I present this medal of honor to Mikl?s Kiss for saving the life of his comrad. Presented on field by Captain James W. Brady, U.S. Air Force. - Is this real? - Yep. The ceremony is over! Come on! Let's get the stuff together! The Germans are coming! Come on! Ride them over! The Hungarians are retreating and looking for soldiers. Don't wait here, come with me. - Are you herdsmen? - Yes. The Russians have crossed the border. There is fighting up north. Give it to me! Take it! Aranka! Aranka! Aranka, you didn't think we'd be coming for you, did you? Wait here! And I will look. Do you have a match? We are leaving with the horses. Everything is alright? Yes. It's damned cold here! - Are you there alone, Mickey? - Yes, Brady. - You all right? - (Fine.) The Germans are all over the bridge. You take Aranka, and I'll follow. Stop! Stop! Stop! Hang in there, boy! We gotta find that place to cross! That's all. These escaped. Mickey! Mickey...! Oh, God! Damn it, Mickey! We are almost there! We are almost there! Where is the man with the bird cage? This way. I got hit. I know. There is nothing wrong, Brady! Put me down, I can make it! You'll be cracking wild Wyoming horses before you know it. Is that the guy? I can hear him. He can't find us. Anyway, damn! I'll take a rest. - Brady... - Yeah? You - go... I stay. A man with a bird cage... is waiting... No, I couldn't leave you! We are cowboys, remember? You and me - buckhands. Wyoming friends... "Going up on Criple Creek..." "Going on the run" "Going up on Criple Creek..." "And I'll have a lot of fun" "Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me..." Aranka... She is on the crossing. You see, Mikey?.. I told you we'd make it. Mickey... Mickey... stay with me...
