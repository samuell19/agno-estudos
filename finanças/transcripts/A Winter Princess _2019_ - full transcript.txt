â™ª Carly, there's this terrible rumour floating around that today is your last day. [sighs] Alison, I'm afraid that it's true. You haven't seen Nicole, have you? She was supposed to give me my exit interview. Well, perhaps we could call it an "exit discussion." It's not every day you get your exit interview from the owner of the resort. So what's your plan? I'm going back to my family business at home. I know how much work it can be. My parents made this place what it is, I've just tried to keep it alive. So you have been our assistant event planner for about a year, and you're going back to Europe, right? A small country in the Alps no one's ever heard of. Oh, one of those ones where they still have a king? He's more like a mayor. So, is Nicole, is she going to be joining us? Uh, Nicole quit after her boyfriend got that job in Denver this fall. She wanted to be closer to him. Well, I knew that she missed him, but with Snowden Fest in just a few days and the sleigh ride and the ice rink... Well, from what I've seen, you have all the events pretty dialled in. But the Snowball, the 50th anniversary, Nicole, she was handling that all herself. Well... Oh, Alison, I would love to stay... Great. I'll get you a new plane ticket. I... I'm afraid it's a little bit more than that. You see, my father and my brother, they... I haven't been home in almost a year. And you know how it is with family... You have to be there. I like the way you think. Do you remember what you wrote on your resume before I hired you? "Objective. "To create inspiring events that bring the community together." Do you feel like you've achieved that? No, I was never really given that chance. So what if you were? Welcome to Aspen, Charlie. This is the first time a general manager has even bothered to meet me on my first day. [car door slams] This townhouse is in the folio you'll be managing for us. Thanks for showing me around like this, Mr. Mitchner. I meet all my new hires, David. Come on inside. I'll show you around. Hey, I'm curious, uh, what's the culture like? It seems like you can get lost pretty easily at a place this big. Three times my first week. You just have to look at the upsides of working at a big resort. Yeah? Yeah, we have three shifts of people working 24/7. So, when you clock out, you clock out. Your free time belongs to you. Oh, so you actually get to see your family? I see them when I can. [phone rings] Speaking of which, that's my sister. [laughs] Nice hat. More of a memento. It used to belong to my roommate. This girl named Carly? Mmm. Then she had to go back to her family in Europe. No one's more bummed about it than me. Brittany, Alison just asked me to plan the Snowball. Are you kidding? It's the 50th anniversary, people are coming from all over, there's a band... don't tell me you said no. You'd only have to stay a few more days, what's stopping you? Just a little something called "My Father." He wants me to do things "by the book." Ah, "the book" again. You have to give me a copy one of these days. No, it is a terrible gift. It tells you how to dress, how to speak, and the exact day you need to fly home by. What if you, like, lost that page? I'm serious, would it kill you to ask him? [phone ringing] Hey, Ali. Sorry, uh, I missed your call. Quick question, how many vacation days have you got stored up? [laughs] Why? Is everything okay? I got some bad news. Nicole quit, and the 50th anniversary ball is coming up. Uh, is there anything I can do? Well, I could really use your help, even if it's only for a week.... Or two. Me? You want me there? Why are you so surprised? I... You just always seem to have everything under control. That's all. Jesse, I need you. Are you in? Father, please. Carlotta. The whole reason I gave you a year off to work at Snowden Peak, was to... ...Accomplish something on my own. Get real life experience. And to work at a place where it doesn't matter whose daughter I am. And did you not get to do that? Well, not really. Most of my time here was spent following my boss's lead, but now that she's gone, they're giving me a chance to work on something really big. There's no way I could stay just a few days longer? But we three have always celebrated your birthday together. Can't you ask Gus to postpone just a few days? Your brother is not the only one who's looking forward to seeing you. Father, I may never get this chance again. It's less than two weeks, and it's really important to me. [sighs] If your conscience says... Thank you! Thank you! You won't regret it, I promise you. I hope not, Carlotta. Love you. [whispers] Yes! Wait, your hat. Look out! Are you okay? Yeah, thank you. Here. Thank you. Well, welcome to Snowden Peak. Enjoy your stay. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Alison! Ah, thanks for meeting me, Carly. I was just informed the pipes broke and the ballroom flooded. Just... Did you already change your plane ticket? Cause... we're going to need another venue for the Snowball Gala. Don't worry. Pipes burst all the time. The Snowball is in 10 days. So, we'll find another venue. Jesse? Hi. I thought you weren't coming! I'm so happy you're here! I thought I would surprise you. Oh, this is great. And Carly here has agreed to stay another few days, too. Oh! Uh, Jesse Mitchner. Mitchner? In case you can't tell, Jesse is my baby brother. Except, when you're older than 10, uh, people say "younger brother." ...Who loves correcting me. Well, welcome... back. Thank you. Jesse is the GM at Aspen Grand. I had some vacation time saved up, and when Alison said that you couldn't stay, I drove up to help out. Oh, well, you're a very dutiful brother. Um... What? Oh, come on. I visit. Do you? Uh... So, Carly. Uh, where are you from? Europe... Uh, so, Alison... Which part? Central. So, Alison... You've done a really good job at losing your accent. Uh, four years of American boarding school. So, Alison, Jesse is here to support me... ...Supervise. ...Partner with you on the Snowball. [phone rings] I have to take this. Carly will fill you in. Let me know when you two lock down a venue. Hi. So, who's on the short list? Long list. Comprehensive list. That's just a fancy word for long. Well, if we leave soon, we can actually tour most of them today. Actually, I think we can tour most of them this morning, because... Yeah. Just narrowed it down to three. Carly! You didn't tell me you're working with Jesse Mitchner. Come, join me... Aw, Brit, I would love to, but Jesse and... Hey. How's it goin'? What are you doing back here, Jesse? I thought you were working up in Aspen. Thought I'd help my sister out for a few days. Ah. Is your brother still around? No, he moved to Boulder. Construction was too slow in the off-season. Shoot, Alison and Nate left too. Yeah. Seasonal work is fine when you're single, but once people have a family, it's kinda hard. [phone rings] Well, it's the plumbers. Excuse me. Jesse here. Everything good over there? Didn't you hear? The banquet hall flooded and the Snowball Gala is in 10 days, and we're supposed to be sharing responsibilities. Don't worry about Jesse. He's one of the good ones. Yeah. Hey, Ali. You have time to talk? Yeah, of course. I just, I want to nail down some roles, some responsibilities. Ooh, so corporate. We don't want to duplicate work, and it really seems like Carly really has a handle on the Snowball. Ah, Jesse, I missed your ability to delegate. I'm not delegating. I just, I want to make sure you play to my strengths. And I would love to at any other time, but... The Snowball's important. I need all hands on deck. Hey, Ali, who let you out of the office? Hi. Jellybean! [laughs] What are you doing here? You're like the CEO of Aspen now. No, no, I'm just, uh... Why didn't you tell me Jellybean was coming? Well, I didn't know until this morning. Also, I've gone by Jesse for the last 25 years. Right. Oh, uh, how about I call you JB for short? Two rocky mountain cocoas? Yes, please. Jesse's actually here to help me out. Ooh, so does that mean you might get a social life again? There's a band playing at Snowshoe Sam's on Saturday, just sayin'. You'll make sure it happens, right? Yeah. On the house. -Cheers. -Cheers. Man, I was actually calling about that banquet hall that you, uh, rent out for weddings. Is it... it's closed? All right. Well, thanks anyways, man. I guess we can cross that one off the list. The Elks Club is closing soon. Should we head over? We could, but I just got an idea. I think I know the perfect place we can throw the Gala. Uh, what, what, um, excuse me? A little help? 42 by 50. 30 feet high. Okay. You have any other time-saving tips for me? Mmhmm. You can't hold the ball here. Why not? You'd exceed fire code. Any reason you didn't tell me that before I started measuring? Well, I feel like there are two types of people in the world. Those who learn by hearing, and those who learn by doing. And you think I'm the second kind. Hmm... You know, I think there are two types of people in this world, too. [condescending] Oh. Okay. Do tell. There's those who are open minded, and those who think they know everything. You know, as much as I want high-end tourists here, I also kind of don't. What happened? So this guy checks into the Matterhorn villa this morning from somewhere in Europe. A Gustave something? Ah, this poor concierge, he really put her through the ringer. I mean, look at these requests. Swiss chocolate powder, buckwheat pillows? Buckwheat? Right? Good news. Chair 3 is back online, and I think I owe you a drink. I would love to, but I need to go over to the Matterhorn. Uh, you should go with Jesse, I'll handle it. Um, are you sure? Uh-huh. Okay, sure. He's all yours. [laughs] Great. Bye, have fun. -Thank you. -Cool. Thanks. Yeah. Why is Gus he here? [engine rumbles and shuts off] [knocking at door] Yes? Carlotta. What are you wearing? Is this company issued? Any chance we could take this inside? Of course, yes. Come in. Please. I didn't realize you were... Is this what they've had you doing? I solve problems, Gus, and I enjoy it. [whispers] Speaking of problems, what are you doing here? "What am I doing here," she asks. We're twins, Carlotta. We naturally gravitate towards each other. [sighs] Father's secretary gave me the address, I thought I'd check in. Nothing's happened, has it? You mean, aside from you missing our birthday? Gus, I called and I left messages. Hmm. Don't tell me you flew all the way here because of that. No, but, in all honesty, there are moments when I feel you've forgotten us. The importance of your true job, the job you were born into, the job that every girl in the world only dreams of. Princess of Landora. Carly, I don't think you truly understand how needed you are at home. You are the only one with Father's ear. Trust me, I'm very aware of my role as the royal family buffer. Part of why I took this year off was that so you and father, you could learn how to talk to each other. Well, it didn't work. Truthfully, when I found out you were staying away longer, I panicked. I only asked for a few more days, just so I could run the Snowball, which I'm really excited about. Did someone say "Ball?" Prince Emile. Uh, I thought that you were in Denmark with the royal family. Have you been to Denmark in winter? Ha! I couldn't pass up the chance. It's good to see you again. So, this Gala. White tie, or black? Ooh- Good question. No, see, that is the thing. Formal around here, it means your good boots. But it's hosted by a princess. Surely that takes things up a notch. See, that's the thing. Nobody knows that I'm a princess. What? Really? And I plan to keep it that way. Throwing the Snowball's hard enough without people curtseying to you, and asking to see your tiara. But you're my sister. Once I tell people who I am... Yes. But what if you didn't? I don't know, Carly. Pretending to be a commoner. It's not exactly in the book. Look, can't we just misplace the book for a few days? At least until the Snowden Fest events. Events? As in plural. Well, if you can't stay until the Snowball, there's an ice rink, oh, and there's a sleigh ride tomorrow. Hm. I don't know, Gus. Could be fun. Hmm, well, I wasn't planning on staying that long, and as far as events are concerned... Oh, loosen up. We're not just going to events, we're going as commoners. Fine, we'll consider it. You can start by losing the royal "we." All right. I'll consider it. And the motorcade. They did almost run someone over this morning. Hmm. I suppose we don't need them with my car here. -All right. -All right. -See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. Be safe. It is good to see you, Carly. That's it, double black diamond, okay? Excellent. -Have fun. -All right. Bye. New arrivals? You could say that. And you're sending them to Devil's Peak? Are you trying to create more work for me? Don't worry. It's my brother and his friend. They're good skiers. Your twin brother is here. He wanted to surprise me for our birthday. Looks like it worked. So, why don't you look happy? I'm just a bit overwhelmed. I still haven't found a venue for the Snowball. At least Jesse's here, right? Right. This was his folks' place, right? Why doesn't he work here? He got his first job at Aspen. I guess he moved up the ranks? Well, doesn't Alison need his help? I guess some people just need to strike out on their own. Hmm. Right. I understand that feeling. [laughs] Sorry, I didn't bring my A game today. No, you did not. But I would have settled for your B, C, or D game. Something on your mind? [sighs] Maybe. Does Carly get off work soon? I'm not sure. I think she's off looking at a venue for the gala. Why? No reason. Emile. Has your childhood crush on my sister returned? What crush? We're old friends. Who are you texting? Father's secretary. Until this moment, I have been on the fence about the Snowball, but... Now I'm thinking we should extend our stay. Why would we do that? Oh, no reason. I think it's good that the two of you rekindle your... friendship, as you call it. And if it gives her another reason to return to Landora, so be it. Now, try and keep up this time. Hey, the freight company left this. Were you expecting any huge boxes? No... Carlotta? Is that Carly? Oh. That's weird. Says it's from Landora. I think she might be from there. Or Luxembourg. No, Landora. I dunno, it's one of the L countries. Just put it by her desk, she'll get it tomorrow. All right. Oh man. Stay warm. There you are, enjoy. This is a great lineup for the sleigh ride. Everybody loves it so far. Hey, I'll take over the cider cart. Go hang with your guests. You're so sweet. You should come meet them. Jesse, hi. Um, so this is my brother Gus, and our friend Emile. Welcome. Pleasure. Must have been a long flight. What, uh, what country are you from, exactly? A small one no one has ever heard of. [laughs] Jesse here is working on the Snowball with me. Yes. -Oh. -Ah. Good for you. Oh, and Carly, you've yet to confirm, is it white or black tie? White tie? They don't do that here. No. It's like a European thing. [laughs] Where is that sleigh? So, how long have you been working with Carly? Long enough to know that she will be missed. Yes, she's been missed at home as well. She's a big part of our family business. Mmhmm. What is it you do, exactly? -Historical preservation. -Government work. We do like a little bit of both. Yes. The sleigh! Nice. [laughs uncomfortably] Have fun. Thanks. Nice to meet you. You too. This way. Follow me. If you are missing home, I brought something to remind you. You did? What is this? Some alpine hot chocolate I whipped up. Ah, it reminds me of early mornings in Geneva. Ah, yes. The academy. Mmhmm. Was it only two years we were at school together? Hmm, I believe so. And then off you went to a school in America. Who knows, maybe if we'd overlapped longer, things might have gone differently. Who knows? Carly! Hold up. Hi. Hey. You're up early. Uh, there's an issue up at the ski school Alison wants me to check out. You? Oh, I needed a minute. And then I ruined it. No. Don't worry, I'll let this one slide. How'd it go with your, uh, your guests last night? Emile was having so much fun. It's harder to tell with my brother. I think he is scared that I won't come home. Should he be? No, of course not. I have to go back. Family business? Family, period. Well, he shouldn't worry. In a few days, you'll be back on a plane to Landora Wait? What? I wouldn't... Who told you I'm from Landora? It must've been on my mind because of that package. Oh, okay. What package? The one under your desk. I haven't been back to my desk yet. It was delivered late last night. Return address said Landora. You're lucky you got it. They put these strange initials in front of your name. "H.R.H Carlotta," no last name. So, I looked it up. And I found a picture of you, Carly. Her Royal Highness, Princess of Landora. Who else knows about this? No one. Then you understand why I want to avoid that word. Princess? Shh!!! It's just a word. With so much baggage. Princess, it means spoiled, entitled, a diva. Does that mean your brother's a prince? [sighs] Crown Prince, heir to the throne. Why did you have to find that... that trunk? Don't worry. Okay, look, I don't think you're spoiled, or a diva. [sighs] That is so nice. But having spent quite a few years as a... [whispers] princess, I have to tell you, that word, it changes things, and I don't want it detracting from the Snowball. So please, can we just keep this between us? Carly, darling... Emile. Just the woman I was looking for. [laughs weakly] Look at you, hitting the trails. It'd be more fun with a tour guide. I would love to hang with you both, but with the Snowball coming up... Perhaps Saturday, then. Yes, I... I... I think I could make that work. Uh, would Gus be joining us? I think he can stand to sit this one out. All right? [engine roars] Bye! Don't tell me he's a prince, too? Yeah. I don't know, Dee. It almost looks too pretty to eat. I never met a cookie I couldn't eat. [laughs] How about you, JB? Oh, I'm good. Thank you. Wait. JB? Dee used to babysit me back in the day, and she's got a whole bunch of nicknames for me that we don't need to mention, or go into greater detail on. Okay. [gasps] Ooh, you should try the cinnamon rolls. Actually, the pecan rolls. So good. You know I am from here, I... I do know the menu. In fact, I might even know a secret item that you don't know. Hmm. Really? Dee, where do you keep that handmade ice cream? Ice cream? I haven't made that in a long time. Not even in the summer? We close down for the summer. So do three-quarter of the businesses up here. That's right. It's been that way for a long time. You know, it's weird. Things change, but in my head, Snowden Peak is still the same as it was when I left for college. Well, that just goes to show you need to visit us more. Well, that's news. What? No ice cream? No. How bad business has gotten here during the summer. You mean it wasn't always this seasonal? When I was growing up, this place was open year round. Huh. It's magical during the summer. Fishing, hiking. This would be a much better place to live if there was year-round work. People could actually put down roots. Are you memorizing the chairlifts? The Summit Lodge? Yeah, have you ever been up there? It's been closed since I was a kid. I think they store the ski school equipment up there in the summer. But it isn't summer. Well, you have an interesting taste in buildings. Come on. Great views, and more than enough square footage. Just imagine this: we dress the room. It's already on resort property... Guests, they arrive with their champagne. Which means we don't have to pay a venue fee. Jesse. I am trying to paint a picture here. I'm trying to paint a picture, too. Mine's just a little bit more of a spreadsheet picture. This is a great find, Carly, and it's given me an idea. The Summit Lodge. Mmhmm. The AC works and the heating works. Yeah, it should. Mom and Dad built it to be a restaurant. It was only open for a heartbeat. Yeah, I mean, skiers loved it, but it's too hard to access, so they repurposed it to storage. But, back then, we hadn't built the parking lot next to Gondola 3. Which now makes it... ...accessible. And there's one more thing. A venue like this, it could really start to change things around here. Change things? People need year-round work. Well, the ballroom is open year round. No one books it. True, but think about why people come to Snowden Peak. To be surrounded in mountains, outside, y'know, the forest. Not stuck in a windowless ballroom. Okay. Say the summit lodge is all of these things. No one knows about it. And we have no publicity budget. But, what if we treated the Snowball like an ad. We could expand the guest list. Add some event planners from Denver. Some CEO types. Oh, what about that wedding planner? The one with the TV show, Preston Bentley? Whose email I might happen to have. You do? We have our fair share of VIP guests at The Aspen Grand. Hmm. Well, if those types of people are coming... this has gotta be a different kind of party. Mmhmm. We gotta up the ante. You know, rethink the menu, get more help. But, it would still only be a fraction of the cost of an ad campaign. All right. All right? You wanna do it? I want theme, mood board, and a revamped guest list tomorrow. All right? Mmhmm. You got it. Yeah. Great work! That went well. Are you kidding? You were amazing. Well, you weren't so bad yourself. You know, I never want to be a commoner, but taking a few days off from being royal, I haven't felt this relaxed in years. Are you relaxed because you're a commoner, or because you're away from your father? Hmm, perhaps a little of both. I'm beginning to see why Carly's gotten so attached to this place. Who knows. Her old life might become more alluring in the next few days. Oh? We have a date Saturday. A date. Where? Not sure yet. But I'll let you know. Maybe. [laughs haughtily] Emile. You must be Gus. I'm Brittany, your sister's roommate? Oh, pleasure. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Happy Hour starts down at The Yodeller soon. [confused] Happy hour? Half price drinks and apps? Ah, right. Sounds... economical. Will Carly be there? No, she's been working nonstop. But it's all starting to pay off. It is? Rumour has it, she's trying to find a way to bring year-round work to the town. Oh, well, I... I had no idea. Yeah. You should be proud of her. See ya. Bye. Hmm. (Carly) It snowed a lot last night. (Jesse) Yeah. Are you sure that this is the only way we can get the tables up there? Yeah, they're too big to fit in the gondola. Would you stop with all the obvious answers? Well, if you stop asking all the obvious questions. This road, it hasn't been plowed in months. Yeah, which is why I wanted to go solo. [tires spinning] Okay. But then who would dig you out? Yeah. Yeah. Careful. Oh. [out of breath] Do you think that there is cell reception up on that ridge? I doubt it. Just keep diggin'. It'll distract you from being cold. I'm gonna need a better distraction than that. Well, you could always talk to me. I mean, fill me in on the whole princess thing. Okay. Well, we live in a castle. Gus is four minutes older than me, and someday he's gonna be king. I was wondering about you. Uh... I mean, what does a princess do all day? Uh, well, between public appearances and ribbon cuttings, I uh, keep the peace with my brother and the king. They don't get along? Well, they could talk more. See, my brother, he wants to become king, and my father wants to retire. Sounds like there's a pretty simple solution there. Nothing is ever simple when it comes to family. [sighs] So then what brought you out here? Well, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do something on my own. I can't really do that back at home. I know the feeling. You don't like being back here? Well, my sister took over the reins when my parents passed. Uh, I was in college. And then I built myself a life in Aspen, and I just never really looked back. And now? Um, well, it's like you said. Nothing is ever simple when it comes to family. [knocking at door] Denmark! [laughs] Father? Gustav. I do hope I'm not intruding. No, no, of... of course. Please, come in. Hey, I got the truck out. Everything good? Jesse, what if this is it? You know, maybe we could save the existential questions for someplace with heat? No. What if this is it? What if this is our theme for the Snowball? Uh, "Empty Forest?" Well, if whatever you're pitching me is nixing the harpist, then yeah, I'm in. No, what if we brought Snowden Peak's natural beauty indoors? We can flock branches, topiaries, hang tea lights. You know, I really plan better when hypothermia isn't setting in, so... maybe we could talk about this back in the office... We can hang shears on the ceiling, and then have a thousand sparkling tiny lights. And then, look over here, Jesse. Carly, careful over there, it looks icy. [screams] Woah! I'm gonna go back to the truck. Okay. Those tables won't get up the mountains themselves, right? No. No. I hope this will suffice. It'll have to. I've sent my entourage away, and I feel better already. Oh, funny you should mention that. Quite funny. You see, we also sent our detail away. It seems Carlotta has... Indeed, where is she? Right, I was just getting into that. You have texted her to tell her I'm here? Haven't you? Have we? It might not be advisable, father, at this time. Perhaps you should take a seat. Right. [chattering] [sighs] Do we really need the goggles? Father, you asked to see Carly, and I'm doing my best to oblige you. The whole "hiding" thing. Do you really want me to... to show up and surprise her at the ball? You know how she dotes on you. The second she sees you, her attention will be taken away from the ball. It means that much to her? It seems to mean a great deal to the people here, and they seem to mean a great deal to Carly, so please wear the goggles. All right. I will. Thank you. Under protest. All right. Oh. [clears throat] Actually, I think I will wait till the ball. Good. Carlotta's always been upbeat, but I've never seen her like this. Well, I wouldn't judge her in one isolated moment, father. She's working hard. She's rarely silly. I meant this happy. Right. Of course. Yes. And there you have it. Winter wonderland. I'm sold. -Eh... -You are? That was fast? I can update the evite list tonight, change the location, send the new ones out. All that leaves is the budget. Love your input on this, Jesse. It's kind of your wheelhouse, right? Sure is. Good job. Double espresso, please. You pulling an all-nighter? Late-nighter. This must be Snowball related. [sighs] I can't seem to make the numbers add up. The event we want is going to cost four times what we can afford. And up at Summit Lodge. Very ambitious. Does everybody know? The prospect of summer work is a big deal around here. Well, I hope people know it's a long-shot. I don't wanna raise people's expectations. Raising expectations. Another word for giving people hope? Also known as getting their hopes up. Listen. Your sister's been running around putting out fires up here. The fact that you and Carly even have a plan, it makes us feel that someone's looking out for us. People haven't felt that way since... since your parents were here. On the house, Jelly... Jesse. Thanks, Dee. You're making better progress on these trees than I am on the budget. Thanks. Maybe we could switch. My hand is cramping up. Not your waving hand. Ah. You think that you know me so well. But this is my waving hand. And this is my ribbon cutting hand. Marvellous. I'm glad I had my tux sent. Emile. How did you find me? Uh, your friend Brittany. Uh, she even drew me a map. [laughs] Right. I'm actually here about later tonight. Tonight... Right. I was thinking of picking you up at 8:00. Unless you didn't want to go. Um... It's, um... 8:00 it is. Excellent. I'll see you then. See you then. Jesse... Emile and I, we... No explanation necessary. Hope those are cookies. Where were my boots? In my closet. You left them in my car about six months ago. The last time we went out. Snowshoe Sam's. Oh, is that tonight? No excuses, Ali. I'm here to hold down the fort. No way, hon. You're coming with us. I am? [country music band plays] â™ª [applause] Emile, how on earth did you find this place? I do my research. Well, you exceeded my expectations. And I hope to continue to. Continue to? Back in Landora. I was thinking maybe I could spend the winter there, if that's something you'd want. Emile, I think that there's been some sort of confusion here. Is there? We're both royal. Yes, we are. We understand each other. I'm not so sure about that. I mean, I know you want to prove something here, but you have to go back to... This isn't just about me anymore. Snowden Peak, it needs this. And you'll do a smash-up job. But you have to go back to your real life in a few days. What then? Jesse's on my team! No, no, no. You ladies play first. I got the first round. Oh, thanks. (Announcement) Would the owner of a black Ferrari please come to the street. Too funny. Everyone here wants to talk to me about my Ferrari. You're car is being towed. Oh, here I'll... I'll go help you. No, no, no, it's freezing. Stay here. Believe it or not, I'm getting better at the whole "handling things myself" thing. Back in a jiffy. â™ª What are you doing here? Local bar, local guy. I take it that's Emile's car? No, a different Ferrari. [laughs] Are princesses allowed to dance, while they wait? They are now. â™ª We're next. So, this is fun. We should do this every week. Woah, easy. Once Jesse leaves, I'm back to my 70-hour work week. Having help is good. Having family is good. Thank you. Thank you. So, do you think he'd ever... stay? He has built a life somewhere else, that's... that's a big ask. Okay, Ali, best friend to best friend, you are an A+ leader, but a B- communicator. Talk to Jesse. This place, it means a lot more to him than he lets on. Really? And there might be some perks to staying that you don't know about. â™ª I didn't even know Carly was here. That's not all you didn't know. Oh, she's leaving in four days... You sure about that? â™ª So, what would happen if you decided you wanted to break tradition? You know, be something other than a princess? Hmm, like what? I don't know. Whatever you wanted to be. My family has ruled in peace for almost 800 years. We've done pretty well following tradition. So, you're happy to be going back to Landora? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. You just said the very thing that I've been trying to avoid. I'm happy here. [laughs] [phone buzzes] Oh. [sighs] It's Emile. Looks like he didn't win over the tow truck driver. He's headed to the impound lot. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. It's late. You sure I can't drive you home? Uh, I have work stuff to finish, and I told Brittany I'd walk her home when her work shift is over. She's closing tonight. [laughs] Is it crazy to say the impound lot was actually kind of exciting? Yes. [laughs] [sighs] It's been quite the week. In a good way. Mainly because of you. Are you sure it's because of me, and not time off from being a prince? I... I suppose I never considered that. Goodnight, Emile. Oh. And remember. I'm not the only royal who can take a year off. â™ª What are you doing here? Uh, I had some work stuff to finish and I told Brittany I'd walk home with her. Oh. How did things go with Emile? Well, his ego's a little bruised, but... his Ferrari's still intact. Oh, good. [laughs] I think I caught a chill at the impound lot. My fingers were so cold I couldn't type. A chill? These are icicles. Forget the fire. This is the only way to fix that. Better? [laughs] This used to be my favourite place to come draw when I was a kid. What did you draw? I went through a dinosaur phase. And then I went through an army guy phase. And then it all came together, uh, dinosaurs vs. army guys. I keep forgetting this isn't just a resort for you. It's home. I think I forgot that for a while, too. Until this time. What makes this time different? [sighs] Um, I'm not sure yet. And for you. You're here early. A lot to do today. Ice rink's opening, got some shipments coming in, have a food budget that won't even cover hors d'oeuvres. Well, it if helps, you've got desserts for free. What? You heard me. Dee's treats is officially donating desserts. And coffee. Thank you. Morning. So, how'd things go last night? Oh, don't ask. Oh. Like that. I'm not even sure what I'm doing here. So, not the best first date? Her idea to come here, be a commoner, what do you think of it? I think... wait, Emile? You're not thinking of following her lead? I don't know, there might be something to taking a year off. Why do you say that? She seems... happy. And if there's anything in this world worth following, it's that. [laughs] I'd call you an ice princess, but, uh, that might be a little bit on the nose. I've warmed up quite a bit, haven't I? You're getting there. [laughs] I have some good news for you about the gala. Huh? Dee is donating desserts and coffee. For free? I told her that if we can get the lodge up and running year-round, she'll be our go-to dessert vendor. Jesse, that's such great news. Yeah. And it's given me an idea. Thanks so much. Um, I heard a rumour that the Summit Lodge might be hosting year-round events? That's really all it is right now, a rumour. Why? Well, normally we all go up to Jackson Hole to wait tables in the off-season, but it'd be so great if something year-round opened. I'll tell you what. You help us out with the Snowball, and any off-season bookings we get, I'll call you first. I think you got yourself a deal. [laughs] Looks like you got yourself some volunteers. Well, you inspire me. Well, this might inspire you even more. I just talked to The Yodeller, and they are doing food for free. And now I just have to stop by Snowden Peak Wines, and we're all set. I have a good feeling. So do I. [announcer voice] Four seconds left on the clock, Jesse Mitchner has the puck. He shoots, and he scores! That's a pretty one-sided game. Well, there's another broomstick over there if you wanna be demolished. Oh, no thanks. I, uh, I wasn't gifted with imaginary hockey skills like you were. I heard what you guys pulled off today, with the donations and the volunteers. Mom and Dad would've been proud. Well, that wasn't me. That was Snowden Peak. The people love this place. I love this place. Enough to stay? I mean, the thought's crossed my mind. Well, I'm gonna need a little more than that. You know, I used to wonder how mom and dad did it, but now I know. Together. I mean, this isn't a one-person job, Jesse. I'm, uh, I'm not sure what you want me to say. Then don't say anything. Hey. Hey. Thanks. I got your text. So, what's going on? Um, Ali wants me to stay here for good. Well, that can't be a surprise. Well, it kind of is. I never knew she needed my help. So, what are you going to do? You ever feel like family's the one thing you can't say no to? [together] You are asking the wrong person. The fog is so intense. Yes, it's unfortunate. If it weren't for the fog, we could see the Summit Lodge where Carly's holding the ball. Emile insists she's done wonders to the interior. Really? Mm. Why do you think Carly came here? I think she wants to leave her mark, and it might be easier to do so away from the palace. You sound as if you're speaking from experience. [sighs] I must admit, at home, I often feel I could be doing more. Are you asking for more responsibility? I suppose I'm asking to spend more time with you. Learning. How to do your job. Gus, when I was made king, I was 19. I never had a youth. I didn't want you to feel burdened as I was. It would not be a burden, father. It would be an honour. [laughs] Why are you laughing? Well, it's funny how life is. I came here to check in on one child, and wound up seeing a whole new side of another. Hmm. Well, I believe it's happy hour. Happy hour? Yes, half price on drinks and appetizers. Ah. Happy hour. Half price drinks. Are you sure, Carly? A promotion to lead event planner, a raise? None of that appeals to you? Alison, of course, I would love to say yes. It's just I... Family. You understand. Yeah- Of course I do. Oh, I just wish my brother did. Well... What? Nothing. [door slams] Hi. Hello. Can I help you? Yes, I just heard about this new space, and I thought I'd check it out for myself. Are you an event planner? I throw several events a year, and, uh, I suppose they're planned. Oh, can you believe this was an empty space just a few days ago? Entirely empty. Incredible. I wish I could take credit for it, but it's mostly our event planner's work. He or she must be very good. She is. Unfortunately, she's leaving us in a few days. Ah. Well, I suppose a new event planner will be easy to find. Not like her. You in town for a while? Yes. I'll leave a ticket for you at the front desk. You should come to the Snowball. See this place in action. Oh, please do. I'd like that very much. Thank you. You're welcome. Great, well, let's talk soon. Hi. Hey. Hey. You wanted to talk? I thought about what you said, and I want to let you know that... the reason I didn't come back to work here. It wasn't because of you. It was because of something bigger. Um. But mom and dad, they... they built this place from nothing. When I moved to Aspen I wasn't Barb and Doug Mitchner's kid. I was anonymous. But now I'm really starting to see the value in a small town, and I... I never begrudged you for moving to Aspen. If anything, I was a little jealous. [laughs] Okay. No regrets. Well, it was always part of my plan to move back here someday. Well, sometimes someday doesn't come soon enough. I don't understand. I was just showing around a potential buyer and we're lucky. Her offer came in really high, especially with the promise of summer business. An offer? Are you selling Snowden Peak? It is just so much to handle on my own. Since you've been here, I've been able to have a life again, and... and that feels good. Lovely. [knocks gently] Uh, I, uh... Found this in the printer. I'll tell you the same thing that I told Jesse. Nothing is etched in stone. Alison, you don't owe me any explanation. Guys, I am not making any decisions until after the Snowball. I mean, you have done an incredible job at putting this together. But I do have to be honest with you. We haven't gotten quite the response we've hoped for. But everyone's going. Well, everyone here is going. But the people we added to the guest-list who could make or break this year-round venue idea, I just found out we haven't heard back from. I mean, unless you have some sort of celebrity draw, getting people all the way out here is a tough sell. I couldn't help but overhear. Are you all right? I'm fine, I... I just, um... I need some air. Carly, what did... I... I know you want to help, Gus. I just need a minute. Of course. Good night. Good night. Carly, I've got your latte here. I'll wait. No, no, no, no right here, come on. Oh, you're so sweet. And, I baked these just for you. Open them. A real princess. -Carlotta! -Carlotta!! Gus. Oh, Carly! Wait! Wait... Where are we going? Ah. Are you angry with me? I am not thrilled. But I'm also confident you have a good explanation. Gus? Carly. I've learned a lot of new things about you on this trip. How committed you are. How much you care about this place. But you are my sister, and I also know how much pride you have. You would never reveal you are a princess just to have a better turnout at the ball. So you leaked my secret to the newspaper? For me? Yes, with the best of intentions. [exhales] Well, this is surprising. I know. Apparently, I'm artistic. I meant that you're even here. I figured after last night... [sighs] I thought about it. I feel like we can still get Alison to change her mind. You do? Mmhmm. Wait. All these people? Volunteers. Who signed up before anyone knew you were a princess. Carly. This is about more than you or me. And these people really believe in your vision for this place. You know, the other day, you asked me why I stayed away. Well, you never asked me what brought me back. It's this. People working together, having each other's backs, making a good thing great. That's Snowden Peak for you. I'm missing it already. [exhales] What, it's so heavy! Try wearing it during a five-hour state dinner. How do you even hold your head up? Strong neck muscles. Mmhmm. [knocking] Enjoy it. Do you have a minute? I'm just about to head to the lodge to decorate. Can we talk later? Well, actually no. Was she terribly upset? Yes. But she did seem to cheer up quite a bit after shoving snow down my sweater. [chuckles] It's just, I've seen how important this place is to her. I had to do something. It was probably the wrong thing to do though, wasn't it? You should have gone about it more honestly. I also know it was a difficult call to make. But, it did make me realize something. What's that? We need to spend more time together. If you can't see the job being done, how are you ever going to do it? You mean?... When you are king. I've learned a lot about you on this trip. I never realized how ready you are for the crown. A true king does what's best for his people. [laughs] Forgive me, father. I'm thrilled, of course. This is unexpected. Well, the best surprises always are. Happy early birthday. Cocoa makes every conversation better. So, what's up? I'm going home to see the queen. Oh, she'll be thrilled. Not when she hears what I'm asking for. A year off from being a prince. Well, huh, this is quite a turn. Yes, it is. Yes. Thank you. I have to tell you, I was jealous. Oh, Emile, you deserve to meet someone... Not jealous of Jesse. I was jealous of you. You did such a brave thing coming here, I figured, why not take a page out of your playbook? So, what's your plan? Hmm, not sure. But wherever I go, I'll be flying coach, getting a job, and figuring things out on my own. Hmm. And leaving the car, right? [coughs] Now, don't get crazy. [laughs] Thanks for helping me see. We're all born into a role, but the person you become is up to you. Cheers. Cheers. (Carly) Thanks so much. (Jesse) Enjoy the rest of your day. Bye. Enjoy your day. Bye. [sighs] [sighs heavily] [laughs] Please say that we're almost done. Well, we've got a couple of finishing touches, and we have to get the sound system up, but we're almost there. Oh, um, I found the most amazing cafÃ© orchestra in Boulder. I'll play you my setlist, listen to this. Well, I thought that we decided on a DJ. No, we talked about it, and we circled back to doing an orchestra. Okay, and what's this orchestra going to be playing? Waltzes, of course. I'm starting to wish I hadn't vetoed the harpist. Oh, come on Jesse. I bet you've never even waltzed before. No. Not a chance. Well, I think you should make sure that the space works. In that case. [waltz] â™ª Elbow up. Okay. Ready? Sure. And a one... [laughs] Counter clockwise. You always have to go counter clockwise, or else you'll crash. Okay. Okay. Why are you leading? I'm trying to show you what to do. [laughs] Okay, I'm gonna get dizzy. I'm... I'm gonna wrap this up. â™ª Well, you got that part down. Carly, oh, you'll never guess who just checked in. The CEO of the Bank of Denver. And the US Ski Team event planner. And Preston Bentley, that guy who does all those TV weddings. I mean, it's happened! Just like you said! â™ª [sighs] Okay. Come on, Jack. Pick up. (Voicemail) This is Jack Walker, Managing Director of The Aspen Grand. Please leave your message and I'll get back to you. Hi, Jack. Jesse Mitchner here. There's, uh, been a complication in Snowden Peak, a good complication. There's something I need to do here. So just um, call me back when you have a sec. Thanks. You forget your party face at home? I'm fine. It's just, I've known Carly was a princess this whole time. She is no different to me, but... [sighs] I'm starting to realize, Ali. She's a princess. What do you mean? This is her life. Everything here was just a... a vacation. This is her reality. Ohhh... I don't want to see you get hurt. You don't have to worry about me. â™ª Oh, very nice. Thank you. May I have the first dance? â™ª Carlotta, you're awfully quiet. Have you nothing to say? Just that your gamble worked. The people who we wanted to come actually came. So, you wanted to say? Thank you. Hm. Well, I should be thanking you. Seeing you go after what you wanted here inspired me to do the same. I don't understand what that means, but I suppose I will take it. Father and I talked. Mmhmm. He's going to have me shadow him this spring. Shadow him? You mean?... Well, if all goes well, I won't be crown prince much longer. So he agreed to step down. Well, not right away, mind you. But within the next year or two. I am so happy for you, Gus. Yes, we have a lot to celebrate. What is this? It's for the wish. You've never missed a year. You remembered. Mm. This is one tradition I always want to keep. Me too. [together] One, two, three... Happy Birthday. Mmm. What is it that you wished for? That your birthday is as good as mine. Excuse me, Gus. I don't want to be forward, but this might also be my only chance to dance with a prince at a ball. I'd love to. [waltz] â™ª There you are. Where have you been all night? Just, uh, you know, taking things in. I'm sorry about all the fuss out there. The whole princess thing. That is who you are. You don't need to apologize for it. It was important for me to see... [sighs] who you're, you know, you're born to be. I don't want to be born into something. I want to choose. And I choose to stay here in Snowden Peak, with you. Don't you think I want that? The way I feel about you. Then, what's stopping you? Happiness comes in a lot of different forms, Carly. Not just this. It comes from family, and from sacrifice, and doing the right thing, and if I encourage you to leave your family, I don't think you could ever forgive me. But Jesse... I'm sorry. I walked away from my family once. I can't be the reason that you walk away from yours. Excuse me. Father... You flew halfway across the world to come to my party? To see my daughter on her birthday, I'd fly just about anywhere. [laughs] Oh... Oh, no, no, no, no. No curtseys. I'm incognito. This is your night. I can't tell you how glad I am to see you. [chuckles] Sorry to interrupt. I had to tell you. I have had four booking requests for the summer. Alison, that's wonderful. Well, I would be happy to reveal myself as royalty anytime you need to drum up business. Carly, people might show up for a spectacle, but they're not going to book the space unless it's top notch. And that has nothing to do with your title. but it has everything to do with what you guys did here. Well, it wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Jesse. Excuse me. So. When will I get to meet this Jesse fellow? Let's just enjoy the party. For a man who's just thrown a heck of a party, you don't look very upbeat. I'm not having the best night. I sense this is romance related. You sense right. I don't envy people your age. Finding the right person isn't easy. You know, what's even more of a struggle is finding someone who might be the one, and then having to walk away from them. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be bothering you with this. No, sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger. So, what's making you walk away? She has some major family obligations. I didn't think it would be fair to pull her away from them. I think I'm going to head out. Thanks for listening. Anytime. Oh, might I give you some advice? Stay at the party a few more minutes. Why? Well, if you leave, your fate is sealed. If you stay, your fortune could change. [waltz] â™ª Everyone is saying such nice things about you. Must be very hard to say goodbye. I promised I would come back home, and a promise is a promise. Well, you made that promise before I saw what you've built here. Well, last time I checked, you didn't raise me to be an event planner. So... No, I raised you to be a princess. Which you will always be, no matter where you are. I saw that tonight, in what you did for this town. Whatever part I played, it was the least I could do. I am happy here. Then, be happy here. You mean? Stay here. Stay? Here? In Snowden Peak? Is that even an option? Well, I never presented it as one before, because I was afraid of losing you. But after seeing all this, I'm not losing a princess. Snowden Peak is gaining one. You have my blessing, Carlotta. Thank you. Well, don't thank me. Thank the young man I met. Young man? Yes. A friend of yours. I don't believe we've been formally introduced. I'm Kristof, Carly's father. And I am extremely embarrassed that I was just pouring my heart out to you. And what exactly did you pour out to my father? I'll let him tell you. It's all yours. Let me just say that I should not have let some fabric and metal and rocks change what I know about who you really are. Thank you. Now, I'm not done hearing about how you poured your heart out to my father. You have plenty of time to hear that. Just give me one minute. So? What's the verdict? Great party. You know I had a thought about a guy who could help you run the resort. [sighs] Hey, he's experienced. He's devoted. Knows the resort through and through. There is a little problem. He's a bit of a delegator. Do not do this to me. I want to. Work that matters? Living up to what mom and dad started? You're serious? You're 100 percent in? I am if you are. You know running this place is tough, even with the two of us. What if it wasn't just the two of us? Oh, you guys. Come here! [laughs] [waltz] â™ª We'll meet you at the Yodeller... Bye! You know, last week I was counting down the days until I could go back to Aspen? And? Ah, somewhere between getting stuck in the snow and planning the most difficult party ever planned... [laughs] I stopped counting. The town got to you? I think you might have got to me, too. What would you say if I told you I've never met anybody like you? I'd say "say it again." â™ª
