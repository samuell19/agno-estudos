Hey, anybody in here? Anybody?! Quiet! Hey, peasant! We're no peasants. We're noblemen. Forgive me, my brother. Which way to Lubicz and Wodokty? Turn left by the cross for Lubicz. Go through Patsunela and then straight on for Wodokty. Thank you! You'll go to Lubicz! Let's go! So long, Jedrus! I shall go, I shall go to the high forest to see if my beloved one is coming. I shall go, I shall go to the wooden gate to see if his horse is waiting... Hey, where's your mistress? Here I am. I'm Andrzej Kmicic. I haven't been to Lubicz yet. I've hastened to pay my respects. The wind's brought me here straight from the camp. A lucky wind, I hope. Did you know of my grandfather's death? I've already mourned for my benefactor. He bequeathed Lubicz and your ladyship to me. You've been turning away, I haven't seen my inheritance yet. How nice it is to get such an inheritance. I'll donate for a hundred masses for my benefactor's soul! When shall we be wed? Not soon. I'm not yours yet. But you will be, even if I had to burn down this house! You're mine by the late grandfather's will and by your heart. I don't know about my heart. If you don't want to be mine, I'll stab myself with a knife. You say that in jest, Sir! Let me invite you to the reception room. My aunt will have supper served. - Whose aunt? - Mine. Then she's my aunt, too! Kulwiecowna. I'd have come earlier but was is not a soldier's mother. It marries us off only with death. You took your time. The regiments came back some time ago. After the lost battle, I stayed to stalk the foe. I nagged them for so long, that there is a price for my head. What a delicious goose! Holy Mary- -- The enemy's taken refuge in the towns for the winter's so severe. My men are ragged as the brooms after long sweeping, so the Great Crown Hetman assigned winter quarters to us. I've sent my officers to Lubicz. They'll come here tomorrow, to pay their respects to you. Drink some wine, Sir, please. I'd even drink poison, if you gave it to me. To your health, Your Ladyship! Dear Lord! The more I look at you, the more I want to get married. When shall we be wed? It's untimely to speak of it, while in mourning. Then I'll wither before the time comes. Well, I'll be damned! Grandpapa always said you were a hothead. You must get accustomed to it. And you must change your habits, it cannot be like this! Oh, so you're going to lead me by the nose. You don't seem to be a man who is easily led. They broke a lot of rods in the monastery to make me memorize some wise maxims. Which one do you remember the best? When in love, throw yourself at her feet. In this manner. Let me go or I'll be angry. My aunt is coming. A regiment of aunts can't stop me from being passionate. Traitor! Judas! That's not true. My kiss is sincere. Would you like to see for yourself? Don't you dare! Where I come from, people say: keep asking, however if it is not given to you, take it yourself. I should leave. It's late. It's a long way to Lubicz and wolves aplenty. Tomorrow I'll pay you a visit with my company. - Goodnight. - May God be with you. Oh, auntie! You sons of the bitches! Jedrus! Drink with us dear host of ours... Stay with us until we lay in the grave... Here's to my lady! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Well, what is she like? Very pretty? Damn it! There's no other like her! You're lucky to have someone to snuggle up to. When's the wedding? After the mourning's over. To hell with the mourning! Children aren't born black but... ...White! Got it?! White! Jedrus! Little babies miss this world. Don't keep them waiting! We'll get drunk at the wedding! You can't kick us, poor orphans, out. What belongs to me, belongs to you! Here's to grandfather Billewicz, who left you Lubicz! You fool! Drinking to the health of the deceased?! Jedrus... We'll sleep on straw, just don't kick us out! Stop it. Whatever is mine, is yours! He won't abandon us! I knew it. - Where will I go? - To Jedrus's place! Where will we go? My beloved. I will be back. Look at your gate See if there's my horse awaiting... Kra! Kra! I am my own master when I'm sitting over a pitch of mead. I don't care for gold I will gladly drink instead! Let's drink up! Gulp, gulp! He slashed at me like this and I slashed at him like that! One, two, three! You won't equal Kmicic anyway! - Nobody will! - That's right! Slice them off, Jedrus! No one can equal him. You try! You can't beat me at shooting either! One ducat a shot! Two! Between the horns! Three! Five! Pistols! Is it loaded? Straight into the skull! Between the horns! He missed! I'll try. Dead centre! Bravo! Give it to me! Between the horns! Fight! Cut! Kill! On the horses! Wenches! Girls! Jesus Christ! Where are Rekuc and Kulwiec? - Asleep. - Wake them up then! No one can know about this. My reputation is at stake. - Yours is as good as ours. - Aren't you to blame? But who was dragging Tumgrat in the cold? With horses?! Who's been breaking the provincial diets? How many have you killed or hurt? Tumgrat forgave me before he died. And a duel can happen to everybody. But that's not all! Shut your mouth! I shall lay the blame on you. I've already warned the girls and the servants not to tell anybody. Look though, my girl, look outside. It's time for war! Mother dear, mother dear I'm going to war That's my destiny... Do you love me? As my own soul. Colonel, Sir! Stop! He's one of my soldiers. Something must've happened. What is it, Soroka? The town is on fire, they're fighting. - Holy Mary! - Don't be afraid, My Lady. Who's fighting? Townsmen didn't want to give up the fodder. Soldiers took it by force. They began firing. We set two houses on fire. There's a terrible turmoil. The bells are tolling. We must go to their aid! Burn the town down! To arms! Silence! I need a horse! I don't need you! I don't want your moaning! Go back to Lubicz and wait there for me. But Sir... Not a word. So long, Olenka! We can't finish our sleigh ride. Be well and don't worry. We wish to pay our respects to Sir Kmicic. But he's not come back from the town yet. I think he'll be right back. He'll be very glad to see you. Have you spoken about marriage'? Sir Kmicic wishes it as soon as possible. I should think so. Why wouldn't he? He'd have to be a fool. Father Kasjan, tell her what you have in mind. Do not doze like a hare at midday in the field. I'm not dozing. I'm just wondering, what to say. Tell us, what you can see. What can I see'? Here's what. Sir Kmicic is a famous soldier. He opposed the enemy alone, when all others quit. Dear God, give us as many such man as possible. But his companions are worthless. On their first day in Lubicz, they were shooting. At what? At the portraits of the late members of Billewicz family. Jesus Christ! Kmicic shouldn't have allowed that to happen! - They were his benefactors. - It cannot be! - It cannot be! - On the contrary. Then they dragged the girls into the room for debauchery. That's an of fence to God. That's never happened here before. They've started with shooting and debauchery. - The very first day. - That's a disgrace. I thought they'd become animals at war. Scoundrels... They bring shame also on him. We're not blaming Sir Kmicic, sweetheart. They're the ones who've been tempting him. He's young and foolish. Great, mighty lady... We were astonished not to be let into this house. I'm astonished as well. Today's Sunday but I haven't seen you at the mass. Great, mighty lady... We've come here to throw ourselves at the feet of our benefactress and ask for help. Tell your men to go with us. We'll take the town by storm and bleed some townsmen. But Kmicic told you to stay put in Lubicz. I think it beseems him to command and you to obey. One would think that you were talking to his servants. It's been 4 days since Jedrus is away. He didn't go to fight in a battle but to punish turbulent soldiers. I have no men to spare. You won't give your men to Kmicic? You're begrudging us your men for Jedrus's rescue? Don't you wish him well? Your company is the worst that could've happen to him anyway. You shall not enter this house. Now get out of here! If it was not for Kmicic, you'd dance to our tune, My Lady. Do you want to stand up to Kmicic? I can stand up to you, too, you pig! Very well then. Whoever draws his sabre first, I'll smash his head. On your horses! Let us drink. It's cold! They're from Lubicz. Yes, Kmicic's companions. Is it them? - Let's have another. - It smells of mead. We don't want spirit, give us mead! There are damsels sitting by the fire. You're right. I wonder, what are they doing... Maybe they've come here to dance? Let's see. What are you doing? Warming our feet. Warming their feet!! Very nice feet. I know a better way of warming feet than sitting by the fire. Dance and the cold will go away! We don't need violins, I'll play on my battle hammer. Let's dance. Leave me alone. Perhaps you'd like to dance with me? - Who are you? - Are you looking for trouble? No use talking, away with you! Get out! I am my own master when I'm sitting over a pitch of mead. I don't care for gold I will gladly drink instead. - I was worried. - My sweet love! I was afraid there might be a battle. A few villagers silenced by soldiers, that's all. What do you mean 'silenced'? One sword stroke in the head is enough. But that's murder! The burghers sent for help. A few soldiers and officers came. I chased the soldiers off... and had them chased naked with whips through the snow. You have neither shame or conscience! Are you sincere or just pretending? You'll be brought to trial. Don't you worry about that. Everybody is his own master in this country. If he has a sword and a few men. Who am I to fear? I am afraid of God's anger and people's tears. You think I don't know about Lubicz? - Who told you about that? - All the nobles speak of it. I should repay them for their kindness then. We were drunk though. I know that those bandits made you do it. These are no bandits. They're my officers. I told them to leave my house! - You ordered them to go? - Yes. - And they did? - Yes. I swear, you have a courage of a cavalryman! They obey Kmicic! They're as obedient as a flock of sheep because they're afraid of me! You must choose between me and them. What for? I've got you and them as well. I won't marry a man with blood and tears on his conscience. Don't drive me mad! What do you want from me?! Just be decent. - Be well. - Farewell. For God's sake! Do you want me to drop dead from my horse? Olenka... Don't cry! For God's sake, don't cry, my dearest! I'll send them away, I'll make up for everything. I'm going to lead a different life. Hlchange. Anybody in here?! Have they drunk themselves unconcious? Rekuc, it's me. Jedrus... - Bring me a priest. - Who slaughtered you? Who did it? The Butryms. Farewell! Olenka, wake up! Wolmontowicze is on fire! What a disaster! Wolmontowicze is on fire! Can you hear that? Oh, God! He did it. - Holy John the Baptist... - ...pray for him. - Holy Joseph... - ...pray for him. - Holy Patriarchs and Prophets... - ...pray for him. - From evil death... - ...save him, oh Lord. - From the torment of hell... - ...save him, oh Lord. From all evil... Open the door. My horse's dropped dead in the forest. They're after me. You've burnt Wolmontowicze. Yes, yes, I did! The devil's coming for my soul, eh? All right. Close the gate and go to the servants' hall. You go in there. Open the door! What's going on? What do you want? - Kmicic burnt Wolmontowicze. - Murdered men, women and children. Kmicic did it! We've already killed his people and now we want his head! Pursue him, why are you standing here? He's not here? We found his horse in the forest. No, the house was locked up. Search the stables and barns. He's escaped to the woods! Follow him! Stop! Don't hide him, young lady, he's accursed. I curse him just as you do. Amen. Come out, Sir... Take a horse and leave. Olenka... You've got blood on your hands like Cain. Go and stay away forever! One seldom meets such worthy people as you. I couldn't feel better in Kiejdany. We thank you, Sir, that you decided to be recovering here. Though you'd have had the best doctors at the Hetman's court. Don't mention it. I'm glad my arm is fit to wield the sword. Soon enough. I've heard you got the letter from the Prince Hetman. Spring is coming. It's time to set off again. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Hetman's given new conscriptions for me and Kmicic. That man is accursed. He will not come back here, unless he seeks his own death. Will you want to march under my command? You're the successor of late Sir Billewicz. If it wasn't for you, no one would've survived the battle. Prince Hetman is terribly worried about your horses. Our horses are good. They can go three days, before they get exhausted. However they've got little looks. And your people are quite tall. It seems like the squadron's mounted dogs! Colonel, Sir! Kmicic has abducted the young lady. I wonder, why did he dare to stay here. He must be very sure of himself. - How many roads lead to the house? - Just this one. Very well. Follow me! Hide behind the carts! To the house! Break down the door with axes! Stop it, damn it! Let's talk. Stop! Who's that? The Banneret of Orsha, Andrzej Kmicic. Who am I speaking with? - Colonel Michal Jerzy Wolodyjowski. - Ave! No time for greetings. You ruffian! These people have a bone to pick with you. You have to account for the blood of innocent people and the abduction of the young lady! You wouldn't call me a ruffian, if the door was open. Open it then! Listen carefully. I've got a barrel of powder here. Leave me alone or I'll blow up the house and everybody in it. He's a madman capable of doing it. Come out and fight with me. If you win, you'll go free. - A nobleman's word? - I swear. No! Don't do it! Silence, damn it! If I don't do it, he'll blow us all up. Well, did the poor gentry agree? They'll swear by their swords, if you like. Let them swear. Come together, gentlemen! I take all of you as witnesses that I've challenged Sir Kmicic to a duel, and I've promised he'll go free, if he wins. Without any obstacles from you. Take the oath! I swear to God Almighty... ...and the Holy Cross... Amen. Come out! Well?! I've trusted your word. - Which one is Colonel Wolodyjowski? - I am. Well, you're not a giant. - Where do we fight? - Here. All right. I feel sorry for you, I've heard you're a great soldier. Therefore I'm warning you for the last time: leave me alone. - Stand your ground! - You asked for it. Shall we wait until the drizzle stops? It's all the same to me. It's a pity to die in such a heavy rain. A Colonel is going to be buried, so the sky is weeping. Let's begin. You swing your sword like a flail. Pick it up! Pick it up. Finish it, Sir, spare me the shame. Let me go! He's alive, he hasn't fallen on his back. Now he's mine, not yours. No butchering. We're knights. One doesn't slaughter the wounded. Dress his wound. Young lady, you're free. I'm Colonel Wolodyjowski, at your feet. Is he dead? Do not fear, young lady. Kmicic is unconscious. No boasting but I take the credit for it! By the living God, answer me! Is he dead? Kmicic? He's just wounded. Thank you, sir. I've come to ask, if you bear me a grudge. Thank you for coming, sir. I bear no grudge, I was defeated by a fine man. So you're the famous Michal Wolodyjowski? Strictly speaking, I'm Jerzy Michal. But Saint George had only slain a dragon and Saint Michael is the officer in heaven. Therefore I prefer to have him as my patron saint. George is certainly no equal to Michael. I presume you're astonished I came out alive... You can finish me off whenever you like. That's not my intention. How's your health, sir? It was a near thing. Where did you learn your skills? At wars. I'm threatened with lawsuits here. I burnt down Wolmontowicze, that's true. I murdered many people as well. But my companions were slaughtered too, like oxen. And Why? Just because they wanted to dance with some damsels? Poor souls. As for abducting the girl... It's true she saved my life, but threw me out afterwards. What was there left for me to do? I'll tell you something, sir. She loves you. How do you know she loves me? I'm not blind. I saw the look on her face when you were brought in here wounded. She loves you. If you don't understand that, it's because you had your head split open. I wish it was true! I didn't say she'd marry you. It is wartime now. You can render great services to your country. Win fame for courage and patch up your reputation. You sound like a good friend. I'm not your friend, sir, but I feel for that lady. If I convince you, that'll be a tribute to my country, too. You're a good soldier. An experienced one. Is there still time for me to do it? I have to go to court straight from bed. There's a remedy for that. The Lord Hetman's writ. You are to enlist soldiers and form a regiment. You'll serve our country and be forgiven. The Hetman left it up to me to give you this letter... ...or not. What are you going to do? I am giving you this letter. I'm happy to see you, sir! I'd go through fire for you! Don't mention it, please. This is Andrzej Kmicic, the Banneret of Orsza. I greet you all. Why have we been called here? We'll probably take the field. It's nothing certain though. My Lord Hetman invites you to come in, sirs! My Lord Hetman invites you to come in, sirs! Forgive me for keeping you waiting. But there are so many things to focus on right now. I've got some unpleasant news. To announce. Apart from the old war, We've got a new one. The Swedes have broken the truce. A beautiful country I can hear its people are valiant. But the magnates are divided, averse to the king. What are the news from the Polish camp? The nobleman are slow to assemble their troops. Perhaps we should wait until King Carl Gustav arrives with the whole army? That would be my advice, if this country had a regular army. I know this country well. Regular army is small. The King is weak and lacks money. Our forces are more than enough against their nobleman. So I may presume that this is already our land. You may, Your Grace. At Kirkholm 3 thousand Polish cavalryman routed 14 thousand of our soldiers. But they were hussars. This time we shall fight against levy in mass. This is Sweden now. Poland is no more. Our motherland is being murdered! Treason! That was a treason! There were just a few of us in the camp. God is my witness that there was nothing we could've done. I've come to Kiejdany with my horse's last breath to serve under the command of a great warrior. And since I've marched with Sir Wolodyjowski many times, it reminded me of the old days. I'm very glad that in this difficult time God's sent me such a famous knight. Good he's come here. No service to the country will remain unrewarded. Yours neither, Colonel Wolodyjowski. I have earned nothing yet. Leave it to me. He who makes his fate dependent on Radziwill's will, shall not perish. Come in the evening for the feast. I shall not keep you longer. I must get to work. Ganchof! Yes, Your Highness? - What do people say? - Everyone is awaiting the command. Only the colonels are wondering, why they weren't told to come with their regiments. Have noblemen arrived in crowds? All the important families are already here. Call Kmicic. - Did you come with your regiment? - As you said, My Highness. Can they be trusted? - They'd go through fire and hell. - Very well. I need such men. And men like you. Ready for anything. The days that are about to come may be so hard, that even the most loyal men could waver. May he who deserts Your Grace in the hour of danger perish! Olenka Billewicz is here. I sent for her, to reconcile you two. How can I repay Your Grace for this? How can I repay for this? Have faith in me. Trust me, and believe that whatever I do, is for the public good. Don't desert me when others will. I swear. Swear by this crucifix that you'll not desert me until you die. Swear to Christ's Passion. To Christ's Passion. I swear. Welcome, Sirs, my brothers! It's good that you've come. We need great strength to save our country and to assist me in my endeavours to do so. To your health! Vivat, Colonels! Suprema lex - love of our homeland. Long live the Lord Hetmam! Defensor Patriae! Lead us against the Swedes! When I was lying abed, close to death, I told myself: I won't take her by force, by sword and fire, but win her by good deeds. I'll restore my good name at war, and be reconciled with all. Won't you say just one kind word? - Can I believe you? - You must. You should. My Lord Hetman and Mr Wolodyjowski did. Why would you alone not believe? I've seen tears shed because of you. The grass hasn't grown on the graves yet. But it Will! And I'll wipe away the tears myself. Do that first. Give me some hope at least. Prince Hetman will speak. Your gracious Sirs! Many among you will be surprised or even horrified by this toast. But whoever believes and trusts me, and has the good of the country at heart, whoever is a loyal friend of the house of Radziwill, will drink it willingly and repeat after me: Long live Carolus Gustavus, King of Sweden! From this day graciously reigning over us! Vivat, vivat! My God! What have I done?! Your Grace, in the name of the Lord! Have mercy on yourself! Have mercy on us! Have mercy on Poland! Don't do it! Don't implore him, he's a traitor! May you die in despair! May your family perish! May the devil take your soul, you traitor! Traitor! I say it thrice: you traitor! Traitor! Kmicic, come here! Guards! I'll be accursed forever. Shame on those who follow the Hetman. Oh, God Almighty! Make your choice! Jesus! Lights! It's time to get some rest, Your Highness. The cocks have already crowed for the second time. I was sleeping and I had a nightmare. What is Kmicic doing? He was banging his head against the wall. And crying about disgrace. He wanted to run but the guards would not let him. He'd drown his sabre, thus they had to tie him up. He's lying peacefully now. What about young Billewicz lady? - There was no order to stop her. - I forgot. Open the window. I can't breathe. Asthma is choking me. What is Kmicic doing? As I've already said, he's lying peacefully. Oh, yes. I remember. Send him in. - Have his fetters taken off. - Your Highness, he is a madman. Have no fear, now go! You swore by the cross you wouldn't desert me. I'll be damned... if I keep this oath, and damned if I don't. What was I to do in the face of a hundredfold stronger foe against whom I could not defend this country? Die. I should die... If I started a war now and died without concluding a treaty, this country would be ruined! Let's suppose I'm making you the Hetman. You're not to die but to save the country. Rush upon thousands but do not perish. You must not die. You have to save your country. I am not the Hetman. It's not for me to decide. But if it's a matter of fighting against thousands... I would do it! For Christ's sake! Do you think that I've accepted Carl Gustav as a king forever'? That I want to unite this land with Sweden? I want to save our country. And all means to this end are good. I need power. But not out of pride. Let he who is strong enough take it. But if there's no such man, I'll take it. What do you want, My Lord? I want the crown! Jesus Christ! I've handed over this country to Swedes to vanquish other foes with their arms. But rocky Sweden has not enough men, not enough swords to keep the whole of Poland. So what will they do? Whom will they give it to? I'll take the crown. After rebuilding this crumbling edifice, and making it stronger, I'll trample our foes with this foot. So help me God and he Holy Cross. Your Grace! My mind can't grasp it. My head is bursting! What's going on in there? Perhaps the help is coming? Help me up. Give us back our colonels! It's Oskierko's infantry! My men! I knew they'd claim us. I wish our soldiers were here! Sir Michal, for God's sake! Tell them to send for your regiment! Be quiet! Send for our regiment! Slaughter the traitors! Quiet! What's going on out there? Tell us! The Scottish Regiment. They're against us. Our people are attacking. God have mercy and don't delay their punishment! And we have to sit right here! Kmicic with his riders... - On whose side? - I don't know. - Did he drop his mace yesterday? - I couldn't see. To think I had this man at my mercy. And I let him live. I hear Wolodyjowski saved Your Grace's life. It was his duty. Now I'll have him shot as a rebel. You can't do it. I beg of you, My Lord. Spare him and the other prisoners. I'll go through fire and water for you. - Just don't refuse me this favour. - What if I refuse? Then have me shot as well! Calm yourself down. Remember who you're speaking to! Don't drive me to despair, Your Highness! I could have listened to your request. But I won't listen to threats. Let me serve you with all my heart, not because I'm forced to. Otherwise I shall go mad. I wrote their death sentence in my mind yesterday. What the Hetman has written, the future Polish King can cancel, in his kindness. You're very persuasive. I can't refuse you anything. Until the end of the war, I'll put them under Swedish guard. Thank you, My Lord. My father. Go on and tell them the good news. No, My Lord. It would look as if I was bragging about my intercession. As you wish. If so, don't waste any more time and fetch the girl. Wolodyjowski's entire regiment keeps guars over her. They'll soften, when she's here. Your regiment's somewhere near, isn't it? - What of it? - We could try to escape. How can we escape? Who's that officer commanding the convoy? Roch Kowalski, Count Kowalski. You might as well talk to his horse. - He's just as stupid. - And he's an officer? The Prince admires his fists. He breaks horseshoes in his hands. And he'll carry out any order, no matter what. He is to my liking then. I always prefer to know, who I'm dealing with. Officer! Sir Kowalski! Come closer, please. What do you want? - Have you got any spirit? - I do. Give us some. Why should I? If it was forbidden, you'd have explicit orders. But you haven't, so give us some. You can't force me to! I'm not. But you're allowed to do it. It's decent to help the old kinsman. If I had married your mother, I could have been your father. Fine kind of kinsman you are! My grandmother's maiden name is Kowalska. Korab coat of arms. Good Lord! Then you're really my kinsman! Call me your uncle! How is your father? Good Lord! I've forgotten his first name! - It's Roch, too. - That's right, Roch begot Roch. As the commandment says. Are you married? I certainly am. I'm Kowalski and this is my wife. I don't want any other. A pity you won't have young Rochs with her. I see you're a clever young man. - Well, let's drink some more. - Alright. Drain it dry. Listen, my dear Roch... Where were the troops with Kmicic going? To fight against rebels. God knows, who is a rebel - you or them. Why? I do what Hetman orders. Just between us... The Hetman has turned his back on the King and the country. Don't tell anyone but that's how it is. I will not listen to that. Hetman's got his superiors... ...and I've got mine. Hetman that is. To be frank, I was your uncle before Radziwill became your hetman. Do you know, Roch, who an uncle is? An uncle... is an uncle! Wisely said! But the Holy Book says: where there's no father, you'll obey your uncle! For he's of the same blood as your mother. I'm not your mother's real brother but my grandmother and yours were sisters. What right does the Hetman have to tell you to harm your father, your mother or your blind grandmother? Answer me! Your blind grandmother... I am Kowalski... ...and this is my wife. Zagloba seems worn out after talking to that fool. Is he really his relative? Like I'm yours. We should get something to eat. Soldier! Where's your commander? We don't know that either! He's left before the dawn and hasn't returned yet. These are my men! With Zagloba! Sir Kowalski, your uncle has arrived. I am Kowalski and this is my wife. Where's my sword? Jesus Christ! The King of Nazareth! No boasting but I take the credit for it! You've ruined me, uncle. From now on, who wants to say: 'a fool', can just say: 'Roch Kowalski'. Quite true. Not many would deny it. You wanted to turn over your kinsman to Swedes?! - I had my orders. - Now you have none. That's true. You have to obey Wolodyjowski, no one else. That's right. - You have to listen to him. - I do. He'll tell you to renounce Radziwill and serve your country. - How can that be? - That's an order! Yes, Sir! Very well. By the way, you'll slaughter Swedes and traitors. An order is an order! I've sent the stupidest officer so that they wouldn't get him over to their side but he betrayed me, too! Your Grace shouldn't have sent a Pole. And make the Swedes think there are no Poles at my side? Where's Kmicic? He went to fetch young Billewicz lady. Set the regiments ready! I'll lead them myself! I'm bringing an invitation from the Prince. I'm happy to see you in good health. When I arrived, I saw Olenka, but she disappeared at once. It's a great honour for us. But we cannot go immediately. You mustn't keep the Prince waiting. We have no choice then? - We are supposed to go to Kiejdany. - What for? The Prince has asked us. I told you we should flee. They won't leave us alone. Tie us up, tell us to go by your horses. We won't leave otherwise. My Ladyship, God is to judge who is right. Me, serving the Hetman, or you calling me a traitor. - But you will go to Kiejdany. - No, we won't. Our servants will defend us. Here are my men coming, My Lady... I'm waiting for you in the carriage. Let's go! Where to, cavalierl? - Wolodyjowski! - At your service. He's got a tiger by the tail! I bring bad luck to you. I'm standing in your way for the second time. You were just a ruffian then. Now no honest man would duel with you. Why is that? Because you're a traitor. You slaughtered soldiers who wanted to defend our country. Your last hour has come. You have no right to judge me. Don't worry about the right, say the prayer. If you have something to say for yourself, say it quick. I'm not sure if this lady will plead for your life. I'm not asking her a favour. You two! Take him behind the barn and shoot him! Don't let them treat me like a dog. I'll go myself. I'll see if he has any Hetman's orders on him. Remember what I found on Roch? Hurry, or they'll be covered in blood. I ordered them to take him that far on purpose. I didn't want the shots to scare the young lady. You'll draw vengeance on our heads. You must escape, come with us. We Will. Dear God! You could at least cross yourself. None of your business, you knave. Get on with it! You could have taken the wretch with you, to do away with him somewhere else. How can we go, she's hardly breathing? It's done. We'll put her into the carriage, you must flee! Radziwill's vengeance will spare nobody. That's right... I've stopped the execution! You did?! Why?! You're asking why?! Let me have a breather. If it wasn't for that worthy man, Kmicic, we'd all be hanging now on trees in Kiejdany! We wanted to kill our benefactor. How can this be? Read this and you'll have the answer. We, Prince Janusz Radziwill... - And then'? - ...the Great Crown Hetman... I'll read it. On the intercession of the Banneret of Orsza, Andrzej Kmicic, we pardon Colonel Wolodyjowski and the vagabond with him... He means me! ...and the other colonels sentenced to death for mutiny. I order them to be taken away to the prison in Birze. On the intercession of the Banneret of Orsza, Andrzej Kmicic! If you're going to have him shot now, then, I swear to God, I'm parting company with you and don't want to see you again! A strange man, in whom there is as much good as evil. Are you really that desperate? Why haven't you shown this letter? You're free to go wherever you want. Think twice. I say beforehand that I shall go nowhere else but to Radziwill. Join us, you'll be our good companion. The motherland will forgive you the of fences against her. I will not. God is to judge, who serves the country better! You, by unleashing civil war, or I - serving the only man who can save this country. Let's go our own ways. To whom have you given oath to?! To Radziwill or the King'? To the Swedes or Poland? You're out of your mind. I knew I couldn't convert you. Farewell. Wait! It's of great importance. Tell us once again. Did Radziwill promise you he'd spare us? Yes, you were to be the captives of Swedes until the war ends. Then know your Radziwill, who betrays not only his country but his servants, too. After dismissing the convoy, shoot these men... but do it so that the news doesn't spread. What's this? The letter from Hetman to the Swedes. I found it on Roch Kowalski. I wish I'd perished at your hands. We should leave as soon as possible for a sword's hanging over our heads. With that man left alive, the house can get burnt and we slaughtered. - Hurry! - We'll be ready by the dawn. God grant us to meet in better times. Farewell. Please, remember the soldier who always wishes you well. My sweet flower, accept the old man's farewell, too. - Where's Kmicic? - He's back, alone. I know. Call him! I came too late. They'd escaped. I wanted to follow them... There's a rumour that all the Polish regiments have mutinied. The only profit is that I've brought the girl here. And you were saved by my letter! Which letter, Your Grace? The one written to me or to the Swedes? So you know? I do. Be gone. How could you do such a thing to me? - Silence! - I won't be silent! In front of those men, I felt embarrassed on your behalf. I ordered the Swedes to shoot them to spare you pain. Look what you've done! They're at the head of the rebellion. Your sentiments and my weakness for you have harmed the country. Perhaps. But each day is a greater torture to me. You're in despair because of that girl. I should get you two married. There'll be some fuss... If she cries the next morning, it means she's just a woman. She doesn't want me, I don't want her. I won't beg her. I'd like to go away... To forget. It's up to you. You want to leave? Today if possible. I'll send you to my brother, Prince Boguslaw, to Podlasie. I'm not strong enough to attack the rebels by myself. Then you'll carry my letters to King Carl Gustav himself. Ask him to send me some cavalry and cannons. I'll crush the rebels! AW requests? My Grace... Don't hesitate. I'm asking Your Grace to protect her from any harm here. You can be sure of that. I'm going far away. I don't know, if I see you again. I wanted to leave without a word but I couldn't. Let us not part in anger, bearing a grudge. May God be with you. I'm bearing no grudge against you. An evil spirit has come between us. The whole sea divides us. May God guide you. And show you the right way. May you leave the one you've strayed to. Don't speak of it, or we'll quarrel again. Give me your hand. Olenka! Shan't we see each other anymore? Andrzej! Leave the traitors and all will be well. I can't. You better not say a word anymore. Good Lord, do we deserve all this? Farewell - for the last time. Why are you crying? Don't, or I'll go crazy! Are you the courtier of Lord Hetman? My name is Kmicic and I'm not a courtier, only a Colonel. Kmicic! Famous for the last war! I've heard a lot about you. You helped my brother to defeat rebels. I'll be glad to know you better. What's new in Kiejdany? I've been as bored in Podlasie as a devil doing penance. I killed all the bears in the area. And the women stink of sheepskin, which my nostrils can't bear. This is a letter from My Lord Hetman. Have a sit. Nothing new. He advises me to move to Taurogi. Which, as you can see, I'm doing. Here I'd have to declare my support to the Swedes or confederates. And it's too early for that. The war isn't over yet. - The Lord Hetman... - He's always late with his advice. Think of the confederates who mutinied against me. They're about to plunder my estates and the beer is strong there. Put them to the sword, when they're drunk. Listen, Sir Kmicic. My advice for you is to go to Taurogi and slaughter the confederates. Pretend to be the follower of the Polish King and a patriot and murder those who won't betray the King. Does it sound reasonable? Your Grace! I serve the Radziwills with my soul and possessions. Your prosperity is mine as well. But I can't grasp and comprehend everything. What do you want then? To learn from you. But I don't know, if Your Grace will answer me frankly. That depends on your question, and on my mood. My Lord Hetman says... all his deeds are for the good of the country. Is he keeping up appearances or telling the truth? And if I told you it's appearances, would you refuse to serve us? Radziwills' prosperity is mine as well. You'll go far. You see... If we, the Radziwills lived in Spain, France or Sweden, where sons succeed to the throne, we'd serve the King and Country and settle for high offices. But in this country? Where the king is elected by noblemen? There's no guarantee that one day they won't elect Sir Nobody! And the Radziwills will still have to kiss his royal hand! It's time to put an end to it! This country is like a red cloth. Everybody who can, takes a piece. We've decided to keep enough of this cloth in our hands, to make a mantle. This country is going to hell! There's a Polish tradition that relatives pull the pillow form under the head of a dying man to end his agony. This is the service we've decided to give to this country. The crown must go to Prince Hetman. But it will be mine afterwards. Don't you feel well, Sir Kmicic? I'm tired after the journey and my head is reeling. I was recently wounded in the duel. Have some rest than. Hetman's written you've got his letter to the Swedish King. Return before departure. You can take mine, too. More! More! Stop! - Saddle the horses! - They're saddled. - Strap the saddlebags! - They're strapped. - A ducat per head! - Thank you Colonel, sir! Soroka! You'll take two men and the packhorses. Take the road to the woods. Out of town at gallop! Yes, Sir! The others load your guns. Saddle two horses for me! Stop! Are you ready to die? If you're risking your head, sir, why shouldn't we? Here is the letter. Tell the Swedish King that I'm on his side. However I must feign for the time being. Who's not pretending? It's inevitable, if one wants to achieve something important. You're right. If you work well, I'll reward you better than Lord Hetman. May I ask for a reward in advance? I have a thoroughbred horse and I don't want to wear him out. Would you mind to keep him until I return? Then you'd better sell him to me. It'd be like selling a friend. He's saved me from trouble a hundred times. Another one of his virtues is that he bites the enemy in battle. Where is this wonder? In the paddock. I presume that's the one. Lead him around. I'll do it. Legs of a deer, step of a wolf, nostrils of an elk. - And breast of a woman. - Well? Well broken in. When you're advancing in a row, you can drop the reins, he won't pull ahead one inch. He holds the line and the rider's hands are free. I could hold a pistol in one hand and a sabre in the other. And if the soldiers are turning back? He'll turn back, too. No horse can do that. See for yourself, Your Grace. Two men at your sides with me behind. I'll give him to you for free, if he pulls ahead. Very well! Get ready. Move ahead! Drop the reins, Your Grace! Hold him! What's this? You scoundrels! Don't you know, who I am?! Don't put up resistance or you'll get a bullet. You traitor! Who are you then?! How dare you raise your hand on me? You'll wrench my arms! Let him go! - Is it about ransom? - No! Where are you taking me? To the confederates. I have your letters! All your of fences against the country will be exposed. You're a fool, Kmicic! I am! I trusted the Radziwills! What's happened? The horses are exhausted. There's not much grass for the horses to pasture on. - We'll be given nothing here. - We've got some food and vodka. We must regain strength. Your Grace shall kindly dismount. What for? I shall eat and drink in the saddle. Get down on the ground. And you - under it! Holy Mary... He's breathing. It must be the devil. I can smell smoke. You fool! If it was the devil, you'd smell sulphur, not smoke. Hey! Anyone in there?! Be on your guard! Bring in the colonel. - Soroka... - Yes, sir? It was the Prince who shot at me, wasn't it? What happened to him? He escaped. That's bad... That's very bad... He killed three of our men and had the best horse. So he won. But we'll meet again. - Soroka! - At your service... You're already up, sir? You were sleeping like oxen. One could chop your heads off! Soroka, we're going to Wolodyjowski. They'll kill us, Sir Colonel. I'd rather die than be considered a traitor by them. Show yourself! What do you want? Come here! Stop yelling from behind the bushes. Can two of us approach you? You can! That would be a miracle, sir, but I really think they're our men. Where's your second son, Kiemlicz? I hope he didn't die in a battle! Good Lord! Father! It's Sir Kmicic! Sweet Jesus! It's Sir Kmicic! Come over here! Those sons of the bitches... You're greeting me with guns? Such a guest! On your knees, scoundrels! On your knees! - Who was the first to shoot? - You, father. He's a lying dog, My Lord! Such a guest! I can't believe my own eyes. Welcome, Sir! What are you waiting for, you idiots? Bring some mead! How did you find yourself out here? When the Butryms beat you in Wolmontowicze, we've gone to the woods. The forest... Misery and hunger. We live on mushrooms and blueberries. The cellar is left uncovered. Give us the key, father. The key? I know you too well. You'll drink more than you'll bring! I'll fetch it myself. - What are you doing now? - We steal horses. - From whom? - From anybody. - From Swedes, too? - Why wouldn't we? - And if they resist? - We thrash them. You do, huh? Alright! You can take horses from the enemy. But if you take them from your own people, then you're rogues, not noblemen. - What do you do with the horses? - Father sells them. Go cover the cellar! The mead isn't good for the wound. Shall I dress it? That's right, you were my barber surgeon. Jesus Christ! Somebody must have shot you at close range. - Kiemlicz! - Yes, sir? How far are the troops who have mutinied against the Lord Hetman? 3 days, if you take the road. Less, if you go through the woods. Kiemlicz! You and your sons are back under my command. It pays off better than stealing horses. Yes, yes... It's just hunger and misery out here. Don't you betray me though. you won't make it. Never! Do you have something to write with? I'll see. I must send a letter but the messenger's to be reliable. We'll find one. - Where is he to go? - To Lord Hetman. However he doesn't need to see him. It's enough, if he delivers it to the first officer he meets. I've got three sheets of paper. But no ink and no pen. The pen is here, and ink can be found. That'll do it. It's easier to cut the heads off than pens. Go away now, Kiemlicz. Good Lord! It's true! He's got our letters! The information in them... But Kmicic can't make these letters public. If he did, he would sentence that girl to death. He knows it's the only way to control us. What girl do you mean? Olenka Billewicz. I'm not asking about her name, only if she's comely. You don't know her. Personified virtue, almost a nun. I've known nuns, too. She's an ardent supporter of the Polish King. So we'll multiply his supporters. Then Kmicic will disclose our secret! I must guard her like the apple of my eye. For the time being. Then I'll give her to you, or even to your dragoons. I give you my word, I won't take her by force. I keep my words, if I give them privately. Politics is different. Invite her to supper tonight. I'll have a look and decide if she's worthwhile. But don't contradict me, whatever I say. Her Majesty, the Queen of France, was so kind to marry me off. - With the Duchess de Rohan... - ...and de la Force. They were beautiful but women in our country are more beautiful. In this room, too. But none is of equal birth or prosperity to you, Your Grace. Allow me to deny it. Polish lady is no worse than French duchess. It would be nothing new, if Radziwill married a noblewomen. Very kind man. But sometimes I'm ashamed of Polish noblemen, when I compare them to foreign ones. A French gentleman can commit an ignoble act. But he won't raise his hand against his king. Dear God! What conspiracy against the former king do you have in mind? Who's scheming?! I met a certain gentleman on my way here. Unaware of my true sentiments for our king, he thought I was his enemy, like the others. For a substantial reward, he promised to go to Silesia to abduct John Casimir and deliver him dead or alive to the Swedes. If he had made me such an offer, I'd have had him shot without judgment. That's what I wanted to do. But I had no witness. People would gossip about Radziwill's willfulness. You shouldn't have let him go alive. He deserves to be impaled. Your Grace can punish him. He's your colonel. Good Lord! My colonel?! Who is he? Tell me! His name is Kmicic. That's not true! If he's your relative or fiance, I'm sorry to have told you this. But I advise you to forget him for he's not worthy of you, My Lady. Forgive me, Your Grace, I was wrong to deny it. That man is capable of anything. Quiet! That's“. ...about ten horses. Your Grace! Have arms at the ready but don't shoot. - Who are you? - And you? - Answer the question! - What's your right to ask? It's a patrol of confederated regiments. We were sent to look for Swedes and suspect people. It seems there are some here, if they don't want to answer. I mean no of fence... but today it's hard to tell a friend from a foe. We're going to the Confederates. Is Colonel Wolodyjowski already in the camp? Perhaps he is. Who's asking? His friend. Forgive me, Your Grace, for not recognizing your rank. We're Wol0dyjowski's soldiers, we'll take you to him. It's Kmicic! Shoot him! - Shall we thrash them? - Yes! Stop! Stop! Surrender! Tie them up! Take the horses and purses! - Take it all! - Hands off! You're a wise man, you know it belongs to us! Dress their wounds. The Holy Cross is my witness that I did not want this fight. Take the wounded and tell others the truth. You attacked us and we had to defend ourselves. The blood of my brothers on my hands again... Oh, Christ! Show me the way... Otherwise I shall lose my mind!

There's a lot of them. May God grant them victory. All over the country they've made me known... as a savage and a traitor. Nobody will trust Kmicic anymore. That's why from now on my name is not Kmicic. It's Babinicz, understood? Yes, Colonel, Sir. Tell my men that even if they're flayed, they have to say I'm Babinicz. Where are we going, sir? To the King. Holy Mary... - But which king? - Not the Swedish one. But His Majesty's taken refuge in Silesia. We'll go to Silesia then. I'd have to renounce everything. Leave it all behind. Destroy my own work with my own hands! And fall foul of the mighty Carl Gustav. And throw yourself at John Casimir's feet... - And yet... - What?! It's the only way to save the country. What about you? Me? The Radziwills? So be it. - That's what's going to happen. - What have you decided? To attack the confederates with Swedish help. You're a true Radziwill! The Swedes only respect the strong. Go to Taurogi and muster as many men as you can. Take the wench with you. But remember! If you force her, we'll both be doomed. I'd be glad to see you happy in Taurogi. Thank you, Your Grace. Forgive me, my lady. - What's happened, Sakowicz? - Forgive us, my lady. What happened there? A spark fell on the powder. - And who managed the fireworks? - Braun did, My Grace. - Have the guilty man shot. - No! Your Grace, I beg of you. Your right is only to order, not to beg. I'd burn Taurogi just to see you smile. Welcome, My Lady! The Prince asks you to deign to accept this gift. Give him my regards. Tell him I'm overjoyed with his gift. - Such a kind man. - Kind? Yes... - And who are you? - My name is Braun. I'm the officer you saved from death. I owe you my life. I am at your command. One more word! Your every word is a favour to me. - Do you know Kmicic? - I've only heard of him. The Prince told me that Kmicic offered to abduct the Polish King. - Is it true? - I don't know, My Lady. But our officers told me that the Prince met Kmicic on his way to Kiejdany and bought a horse from him. The Prince came back very agitated. It might have been then. The peasants must've resisted. Water the horses. Sir! Must be some important Swede. A general. Fire first, then slaughter the soldiers. Take the important one alive. Wait... I'm Wejhard, count Wrzesowicz. I was sent to meet Your Excellency by the Swedish King, who was anxious about the Imperial Envoy. I'm glad to meet you, Sir. You can see for yourself, what's happened. Do YOU play chess? There's no time for it at war. That's a pity. That game has a lot in common with politics. Though it's easier to handle kings on a chessboard. As an Imperial Envoy, I've guided the actions of real kings. Sit down, Sir. A glass of wine? It's from imperial cellars. Is victory still following Charles Gustav? Some Polish troops have been dispersed, others have joined us. The whole nation has recognized the power of the King of Sweden. I'm told Gdansk did not let the Swedish army in. A few cities and castles are still faithful to John Casimir. We also heard about groups of noblemen and peasants. What are they compared to the army?! History is full of such examples. Your Excellency, we are ready to go now. I've heard... the King of Sweden wants to take the Czestochowa Monastery. His Imperial Majesty has a special sentiment towards this place. There are orders to occupy all strongholds. The gentry and peasants are already astir. The Polish King remains nearby, in Silesia. It'd be easy for them to stir up new revolts. Your Excellency, the Monastery is a stronghold. I am telling you what I heard. The Swedes are planning to attack the Monastery. And soon! God forbid that I suspect this gentleman of lying. However Swedes assured us they wouldn't take the monastery. Why are you trying to frighten the clergy and us, the refugees? I'm just warning you. If you don't listen, you'll bear responsibility. Don't raise your voice. We must verify your news. - Ask then. - I will. You said you've come here because you don't want to serve Swedes or the traitor. There are rebels in Lithuania. Why didn't you join them? That's my concern. Your concern... If you come from Lithuania, you must know the traitors. Tell me their names. One is the most famous of all. Haven't you heard about the arch-villain? Ihaven%. It's not possible. That man sheds the blood of his brothers, like Cain. Haven't you heard about Kmicic? Reverend Fathers... I'll bear anything, if one of you interrogates me. But do not let this man torment me any longer! One more question. You'd like us to believe your tidings. God is my witness, I would. What reward do you expect for it? All this is my war booty. I wanted to offer it to Virgin Mary. But only after confession, with a clear conscience. The truth shines through your anger. But how could we throw out the faithful? Keep the gates closed day and night? The forces of hell cannot prevail. No heretic shall set his foot in this sacred place. His power shall be destroyed. I'm not the one speaking this words. It's the Holy Ghost speaking through me. Reverend Father! I'm telling you this as a soldier. Make fast the walls, lock the gates. For Christ's sake, keep the gates locked. Quick! Colonel, we've come to ask you to release us from service. Don't you want to defend the monastery? YOU dogs! Very well. Take your pay and away with you. You scoundrel! We're not worthy to admire the splendour of Czestochowa. Oh, Virgin Mary, our Morning Star. We're not worthy... But we'll not stop serving you outside the walls. We'll go, where you want us to. You'll have servants, at the ready. Away with you! Your Grace! I bring important tidings from the Lord Hetman. I'll receive him tomorrow. The confederates have defeated us twice. The Swedes have abandoned us. We're besieged. You're our only hope, Your Grace. Prince Hetman is ill. You need a doctor then, not me. The castle can hold out for a long time. Come back in a week or two. If you don't come tomorrow... I'm hunting bears tomorrow. The day after that there's a tournament. You may take part in it. The Prince... He's lost his head. I can feel the stone's off my chest. I feel better now. No news from Prince Boguslaw? No, Your Grace. And from the Swedish King? The confederates must have intercepted the letters. Defeated and besieged... I'm not needed by anyone. I can feel the cold. I can't see Her but I can feel Her. - She's here. - Who? Death! They're fighting. As usual. It's cold so they're fighting to make themselves warm. Boguslaw! Help! What do you want? Take that crown... Help me. Anyone?! Jesus! Where is the Prince?! Why did you stay with the traitor, you fool? I loved him. You can kill me. We're hearing many different news in Taurogi. We can't tell a lie from the truth. Some say Hetman died a natural death. Others that he was slayed. Why did he die? You're the cause of his downfall and death. - Me? - Yes. Prince Boguslaw preferred to stay here then rescue his uncle. He's been lost to the world at your elbow, My Lady. Tell me, what's going on around me. The Prince is in love with you. Can't you see? All the balls, feasts, hunts - it's all for you. But his love is evil. He wants to disgrace you. Should you help me to escape? If it wasn't for my oath... Thank you. Lower! I didn't expect the war to be that terrible. Not every bullet kills. Otherwise mothers wouldn't have children fast enough. Down! You could have been blown to powder! Do we have too much powder? You'd load a cannon with me. I'd kill Swedes after my death! When will they bring the culverin? - It takes time. - I've got none! The rebels are prowling the roads, General, Sir! The monks will surrender. They're defending to get better conditions. Let's send negotiators. Would you go to the monastery? I'll go. I'm a Pole and a catholic. It'll be easier for me to convince them. I didn't expect the clerics to have such officers. May I ask your name? Babinicz. And I am officer Kuklinowski, You must have heard of me. My name and sword have won fame in many a war, not only in this country but also abroad. Yes, I've heard of you. Come on in. Take no of fence but there are only two real soldiers in Poland. Kuklinowski in the Kingdom and Kmicic in the Duchy of Lithuania. I'd be glad, if you accompanied me on my way back as well. I'll wait for you here. The whole country has surrendered, the King has fled abroad. Why are you exposing yourselves and this sacred place to the vengeance of the invincible Swedish army?! We, Poles, have come here with Swedes to prevent sacrilege, when the monastery falls. And it will fall. They're waiting for heavy guns. But how can we defend it, if you're exasperating the enemy with your resistance?! It can only end in destruction of this sacred church! My brothers! Reverend and beloved Fathers! Don't have this on your conscience. You didn't build this sanctuary and it is not only to serve you. May it bring joy to our sons and grandsons. I await your answer, Reverend Fathers. You've failed, haven't you? Our priests are stubborn. Between you and me, they're wrong. We can't defend ourselves forever. You think they're wrong'? You've got brains. Show me through the gate, I've something to tell you. Me as well. This monastery is on fire. Only fools stay in a burning house. Perhaps you're afraid to be called a traitor? Spit on them who call you that! Join us! Me, Kuklinowski, is making you this offer. Do you say that as the Swedish envoy? I'm not an envoy outside the gate. I'm speaking for myself. To hell with that nasty fortress! - You're speaking for yourself? - I am! Then I can answer you in private? Why certainly! Then listen, Kuklinowski... You're a scoundrel! A rascal and a stinking brute! - What? - A stinking brute! Is that enough? Or shall I spit in your face? That's for you, not the envoy! Our God he is our stronghold, Our refuge and protection, When the foe of truth divine, Threatens it with destruction. Have no fear! God's with us [...] Mother of God, Holy Virgin, Blessed by the Lord, Mary, Mother of Thy Son, Our Lord, Maria, Pray for mercy for us, Hand it over to us. Kyrie Eleison ... It's not about our lives, our wives or children! It's about this sacred place! Father, you can't take such a responsibility... They'll knock down the walls! We must surrender the fortress! What do you want? Father, the walls won't last more than one day. Father, the culverin must be blown up. Who's going to do it? I Will. I'm begging you, let me go with you. It's harder for two men to go unnoticed. I'd go myself, sir. Make the fuse shorter. You won't have enough time to stand clear. Do it! Otherwise they'll notice it and put it out. Good Lord! I want to draw my sabre just looking at you! I'm noticeable from afar! I'll just put it in the cannon's mouth and light the fuse! The culverin will go to h... It'll go to pieces. But they put powder in it every day and it doesn't. Father, you have a heroic and saintly heart. - Stop it. - I mean it! But you know nothing about the guns. When the powder explodes in the rear, it pushes the cannon ball out. But if you put it in front, the cannon is not going to last. - Would you confirm that? - Every soldier knows that. Wouldn't it be better to go there at night and... Spike the gun? They're on their guard. We'd only lose people. Who could recognize me in this disguise? When the fuse catches fire, I'll stand clear. The explosion will cause chaos and I'll escape. Oh God, so many dangers! Only one man in a hundred would come back from such a trip. I've faced many dangers... Not to brag about it or gain fame... Here's a sausage for you, doggy. - Who's there? - It's me, Hans. I'm looking for the ramrod. Password? Uppsala. Hurry up, we're going to start firing soon. It'll take a second. I know this rogue. He's Babinicz from the monastery garrison. My name isn't Babinicz. I am Kmicic. Kmicic?! It's a name famous throughout Poland. General, he's a soldier second to none. Except me. I don't want to hear you praising him! What will you do with him, Your Grace'? I'd have him hanged. But I'm a soldier myself. I value courage. He'll be shot. Then every Pole will abandon us and take John Casimir's side. Do you want me to spare his life? I want you to give him to me. This is all I ask for my services. Kuklinowski, do you want to save him? I'll skin him alive and take the blame for it. You dogcatcher! We can talk, we've got time. I told you there were only two real soldiers in this country. Me and you. The famous commander, sir Kmicic, and Kuklinowski's got him... and he'll burn his sides. You dogcatcher! Oh yes, that's what he's going to do. Well, how do you like it? You can scream. No? A little more then. Not too much right away. Easy... We've got time. Who, the hell, is it? My Grace, General Miller wants to see you now. Oh, it's you, Kiemlicz. Alright. Warm, wasn't it? You can cool down a little now. I'll be back soon, for a chat. - Who's there? - We've come to have a look. Then look, you haven't seen such a wonder before... We've been looking for a chance since morning. Hurry UP! Hurry! Go on! Cut the colonel's bonds. The horses are awaiting. - How are you feeling, sir? - My legs are a little weak. Some vodka will help. Clothes for our colonel! Quick! I feel better already. He burnt my side a little, but that's nothing. - Quick! - I'm all good already. The horses are waiting. No... I'll stay and wait for that traitor. Kiemlicz! What the hell? Are you mad? Miller's asleep, his guards didn't let me in. The officer's waiting for Your Grace in the stable. Well, Kuklinowski?! You wanted to match Kmicic, you bandit? Be one of his company? Meet Kmicic then! I'll let you live. So that you can... ...be thinking of Kmicic. - Mount the horses. - Where to, sir? To Silesia! To the King! Many come here, expecting a reward, to bring false and deceptive tidings. There's no law in Poland allowing you to call a nobleman a liar. You're speaking to the Great Chancellor! Whoever says I'm lying, will hear me saying that it's easier to call me a liar than to risk one's life. It's easier to seal with wax than with blood. I'm not saying you're lying. But if you spoke the truth, your side should be burnt. There's no need for it. We believe you. Your Majesty! Let the doubting Thomases touch my wounds. I do believe you. I never doubted you were telling the truth. Your merit and pain will not pass for nothing. God grant that we may soon return to our beloved motherland. But many spies are sent here. Prince Boguslaw reported that an attempt on us was planned. An attempt on Your Majesty? He said there was a man who offered to abduct us. And bring us dead or alive to the Swedes. Who was it? A certain Kmicic. That's a lie. That's a lie! Prince Boguslaw is a liar! Don't believe that traitor, Your Majesty! He lied to disgrace his enemy! Lift him up and call a doctor. Either he's so honest that repulsion overwhelmed him or he's some relative of Kmicic. Your Grace, God forbid that I say anything against him, but he shouldn't be trusted too readily. Why shouldn't I trust a soldier who's shed his blood for our country? I haven't lost my throne yet if I have such allies. - He'll stay with me. - But, Your Majesty... Enough about this. I've summoned you to discuss certain matters. We're going back to Poland. I don't want to contradict Your Majesty, but I think we should wait. Wait until the resistance increases in Poland. Your Majesty, the reports say that the time is ripe to return. Only the presence of the King may hasten the victory. The Tartar Khan has promised his help, if the King returns to the motherland. Sir Czarniecki speaks as a soldier. But King's security is at stake. Whatever our fate may be, we're leaving in a day or two. Now we must consider the safest way to do it. We await your advice, General Czarniecki. We must divert Swedes' attention. I'll take 300 dragoons and a few carriages. I'll be proclaiming, I'm escorting the King himself. Your Majesty will start later, with a small troop. The enemy is going to throw his forces against me. I heard one of Babinicz's men calling him a colonel. He silenced him just with the look of his face. I think he's hiding something, too. It's none of our concern. If he's a traitor, Poland will be lost with you. I'll ask him some questions myself. Colonel! Sir Babinicz! The King wants to talk to you. You traitor! Treason! Wait... For Christ's sake! Save yourself, Your Majesty! I'll stop them! Kiemlicz, follow me! Forgive me, my sons. We forgive you. And you forgive us, Father. I do. Good people! Do you know who you've just rescued? This is your King! You have saved his life. Your merits won't be forgotten. Look for Babinicz! To think you called him a traitor! - It is my fault, Your Majesty. - Look for Babinicz! I will not leave until I look him in the eye. He's still breathing! Dear God, Babinicz, how shall I repay you? I'm not Babinicz. I'm Kmicic. You let the Polish King pass. You let Czarniecki pass. But Your Majesty... Your Majesty always has to correct his generals' mistakes. Where is my beloved brother, the Polish King, now? Tell me! Where are the Polish armies? - Any news of the enemy? - None, Your Majesty. We only defeated some peasants and nobles. Even if I have to chase my beloved royal brother all over Poland, I'll catch him. Here's to those who were the first to raise their swords against the traitor, late Hetman. We had to disobey orders for the first and the last time, I hope. We couldn't do otherwise. Allegiance must have its limits, beyond which there is only guilt and crime. The motherland will not forget your services. We'll muster a new army here and you'll take the field with general Czarniecki. We are happy to be here with Your Majesty. But we're eager to fight Swedes as well. Be patient. Before you take the field, you'll stay here to defend the King. Speaking of Your Majesty's security... I heard that Prince Boguslaw said... Was it about Kmicic? - Yes, Your Majesty. - That's right. None of that was true, Boguslaw was lying. Call Babinicz. But tell me what you know about the man. He was a great soldier but terribly wild. The he brought discredit on himself in Kiejdany. - He's done a lot of harm. - But he saved our lives. He begged Radziwill not to shoot us. Really? And Radziwill released you? Sir Zagloba rescued us from captivity. He made the officer believe he was his kin and got him drunk. Then he took his clothes and brought my regiment. No boasting but I take the credit for it! - How did you get so clever? - It'll reveal my secret. I always carry hemp seeds with me and eat them little by little. It sharpens the wit enormously. But why? There's oil in hemp and that oils the brain. But the oil goes to your belly not to your brain! I have a way with that, too. One must drink a lot of wine. The oil, being lighter, floats on top. The wine, going to one's head, carries it up. Can sunflower seeds replace hemp seed? Of course! However sunflower oil is heavier so one must drink stronger alcohol. I've heard royal meads are the best! What a shrewd fellow! You'll find a few bottles in your rooms. Jesus Christ! Your Majesty! This is Kmicic! You've known him as a brawler and Radziwill's ally. But he's the hero of Czestochowa and my loyal servant, who stood up for me. This is the new Kmicic. Meet him and love him, he's worth it. It was not me who he wanted to abduct but Prince Boguslaw to bring him to you. Embrace him! I've always liked you! And I you! What angel has converted you? Did you find many people with the Hetman? Just a few foreign officers. In God's name! I'm not asking about soldiers! Prince Boguslaw took Lady Billewicz to Taurogi. Woe! She's still in love with Kmicic. That's certain. All my efforts in vain. It's never happened to me before! That's because Your Grace has scruples. You fool! It must be witchcraft! My head is reeling... To make love to her... Embrace her... - Have children with her? - You're right! How did you know? What's happening to me? Shall I marry her, damn it?! You shan't even think of it. But I do! This is no joke. Be thankful that Sakowicz is your friend. Devil's whispered in your ear? Tell me. I'll be your best man, Your Majesty. Don't fool around! There's a man who used to be a priest in here. What do I care? He'll tack you two together. But he's a poor craftsman, not a member of the guild. It'll be easy to unpick the stitches. Do you understand, Your Grace? Damn it, I do understand very well! But Charles Gustav has called for me. I must leave in a few days. Haste will be the explanation for some unimportant cleric marrying you. One day you'll be hanged, Sakowicz. It cannot be otherwise. I don't know everything... But their plans concern you. The troops are ready for departure. If the Prince is going to do something, It'll be any day now. Look how this candle is burning... What was that? I'm saying one virginity will melt like wax tonight. I wish it could be done today! Even at midnight. Put tongs into the fire in case the priest refuses to comply. It won't be necessary. He's a black-hearted villain. It'll be a black-hearted wedding. Can't be otherwise, when the best man is a procurer. May I see Olenka? Your Grace... She says her grandfather's will forbids her to decide her fate. And that she wouldn't marry you anyway. Can you hear that, Sakowicz? Your decisions and wills mean nothing to me! But they mean everything to us. She must either take the veil or marry Kmicic. Who?! Kmicic?! I'll show you Kmicic! Shut up, you useless woman! Shut up or I'll cut your sweet throat! Be quiet and stay here. Your niece's wedding is starting upstairs. She had a dagger, I made her drop it, as I was taught in Italy. Suddenly I felt a terrible pain and saw nothing but darkness. My head is still reeling! The devil must be helping them. Which one of them practices witchcraft? It can't be her, she's a virgin. - It may be the aunt. - I'd agree. We should make a hole in the ice and drown that hag in the river. Spring's coming. The stars will be different and the nights shorter. Devils will be losing their powers. - I'm leaving tomorrow. - You're not well. I must go. Carl Gustav keeps sending letters full of anger. The infantry and artillery will go tonight. We'll leave with cavalry at dawn. I'll take the girl with me and the aunt... Under the ice with her! The wagons are moving. It's time! Confederate patrols are nearby. May God be with you. You're not coming with us? The Prince may be a scoundrel but I'm still his soldier. - Aren't you in danger? - No. They couldn't have flown up the chimney! Who was visiting them? Me, Patterson, McGregory and Hagen... And Braun whose life she'd saved. Kill me... You must feel you're dying. Let's go! Quicker. Close in! I'm still weak. We're taking the field today. I envy you. Your time will come. But practice every day. It won't be easy to defeat Boguslaw. One of us is destined to die. You bend your wrist too much. A brother wouldn't do more for me. I'll finally find them and make them fight me. It's not clear, who's chasing who right now. Poles can be found everywhere and nowhere. It's like fighting ghosts. Your Majesty, Czarniecki's army is stronger every day. I've asked Prince Boguslaw for help. One battle will change everything. The cannons will be decisive! We'll have no cannons, before the battle with Czarniecki. When will you, oh Lord, grant peace to this nation and a fireplace and mulled beer to me? Why must I always have my belly shaken up in the vanguard. Anybody else would rest and have a feast. But our general Czarniecki made up a new tradition. He's rushing forward and forward, damn it! Do not blaspheme against him! I'm not. It's my guts! Hunger plays a tune like they were a violin! Then Swedes will dance to that tune. To hell with them! If they give up the Livland and pay the contribution, I'll let them live then. A Cossack caught a Tartar and the Tartar is holding him by the head! Carl Gustav is still occupying Poznan, Warsaw, Cracow and other cities. And you'd like him to surrender?! We'll have to take pains to defeat him and chase him out of our country! I command retreat! The foe has put fire and water between us and is sneering at us. He who loves God and his country - follow me! To His Gracious Majesty, the illustrious John Casimir, The King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Prussia, Masovia, Samogitia and Livland, Heir of the Swedish Crown... We, the mightiest Mehmed Salamed Gerey, the happiest ruler of our times, Heir to the house of Genghis Khan and Commander of the hordes of Crimea, Nohai, Perekokski, Czerkieski and Semenidi. The envoy of Your Royal Grace reached us safely and trusted us with many secrets worthy of our attention. We shall not neglect anything that could help establish peace and which would bring happiness to the sons of Allah. We therefore send our envoy, Aga, whom Your Majesty may keep with his men as a proof of our friendship. He will convey our secret thoughts to Your Majesty. He is our servant and faithful dog who will obey Your Majesty until he dies. It won't be easy to control them. They'll start killing our man and burning homes. Your Majesty, allow me to have these Tartars under my command. I'm not saying no. But what if Aga refuses? I'll have him tied to my saddle with a rope. If the King's sent you as a guide, you'll show me the way. The King's sent me as a commander, not as a guide. The Khan rules the Tartars, not the King. Then listen to me, Aga. The Khan gave you to the King like a dog. Don't offend the King or you'll be leashed like a dog. Don't irritate me! Listen, you son of a goat! You wanted freedom to plunder, burn and slaughter! You wanted a guide?! Here's your guide! Look at that, you slave! Give me another horse! General, Sir, they won't ford the river. Then it's no use hiding. Lead us to attack, Babinicz! Officers to your regiments! Approach the river! Fire at the ford! I'd try that ford again. Take the light cavalry, cross the river and attack. My Lord, Kmicic will get killed! If he's clever, he'll win, not die. Now go! Cease the fire! That's what I wanted! Stop! Don't kill me! The girl... Speak up! She's going to die, if you kill me. - I gave my orders. - What did you do to her? Spare me, I'll give her back. I swear to the Bible. I'd give a hundred rascals like you for one hair of hers. But I don't believe you, you perjurer! I'll give you a safe conduct and a written order. I'd sooner have expected death. The devil gave orders to kill Olenka, if he dies. You've released a traitor! Punish me, Oh God, for my sins. Not by my guilt though but by your mercy. I'd never sentence her to death! What do you intend to do? I'm going to Taurogi. Charles Gustav is preparing a great army. I'll be back in two weeks. Enough! The motherland won't perish! In two weeks! Young lady Billewicz will hand you over Wodokty, together with the land she owns. The monastery will get everything you see here. Are there many sheep? Are you preparing to shear them already'? This sheep will be enough for you. Stop! Stop! Is he still alive or dead'? Alive but death hovers around him. He was wounded at war. He asked to be taken to Lubicz. That's where he wants to die. Hurry! Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Lord, count in his favour that his death's been inflicted by the enemy. Forgive him. Have mercy on him. - Is it over? - He's still alive. Soroka? At your service, sir. Who is at Wodokty? The young lad)!- Praise the Lord! Have they been asking about me? Every day, until we told them that you were going to live. And then they stopped? Then they stopped. What do you think of Kmicic, my daughter? God knows that I don't want to think about him. You see... I've been hearing different opinions. Don't you think your grandfather's will should be fulfilled? Never! I can take the veil. Never! There's only blood and ruin here. He betrayed his motherland, wanted to abduct the King... I'd forgiven him before... Because I loved him with all my heart. But now I can't. Dear Lord, I can't! But he risked his life and shed his blood for his country. He did... when the foe was losing. When he could profit by it. Does that make him honest? That's true. Can a wound efface that? I'd give everything for it not to be true. But it's done and can't be undone. - Soroka? - Yes, sir! Wolodyjowski's regiment hasn't returned yet, has it? It's expected any day now. You didn't say anything about me? I've got no such order. - What day is it? - A cold one, sir. That's not what I'm asking about. It's Saturday. Shave me and we'll go to church tomorrow. Praised be Jesus Christ. Now and forever. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. On the third Sunday after the Epiphany in 1658, the Gospel to be read is Saint Matthew's, Chapter VIII. And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him: And behold a leper came and adored him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus put forth his hand, touched him, saying: be thou made clean. And his leprosy was cleansed. We, John Casimir, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Masovia, Prussia etc... In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. We announce hereby that whatever guilt and punishment weighed upon Andrzej Kmicic, considering his subsequent merits, shall be forgotten. Andrzej Kmicic was misled by Prince Radziwill. Realising his mistake, not only did he never promise to lift his hand against us but abducted Prince Boguslaw to avenge us and the ravaged Motherland. God, have mercy on me! He was wounded by the Prince. As soon as he recovered, he left to Czestochowa to defend the monastery, where he blew up the biggest Swedish cannon. After he was apprehended by the cruel foe, his flesh was burnt with fire. Saved from this predicament by the Holy Virgin's power, he came to us, to Silesia, and during our journey back to the Motherland, defending the King at the battlefield, was found almost dead. Oh God, God! And when he recovered he fought on, until the enemy was driven away from our country. Therefore We, considering all his merits, have decided to proclaim them publicly, so that he was no longer persecuted by human hate, and could live in glory and be admired. Well, Olenka... Jedrus, I'm not worthy to kiss your wounds! I'm speaking to you now, Sir Andrzej! It's not enough to risk your life and slaughter the enemy. So many men were killed in that war! You must give new defenders to our beloved country! And I trust you won't lack the courage or the desire to do so. Vivat! I wish you every happiness, Colonel!
