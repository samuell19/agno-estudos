I can't hear you! Bad, evil… You should know better, she's little! Ugly, evil bitch. I hate you. What did you say? Šarlota, come back! Wait! Šarlota! Tamara, stop following me, leave me alone! Wait for me! Leave me alone, Tamara! CHAPTER 1 - ARRIVAL Hello? Hello! Anybody home? We need to make a fire. To protect ourselves from the witch's spirit. Asshole! What are you doing?! What? You wanted a fire! Wait. Hold this. We saw you hiking up here, we wanna ask you something. What? Like, what's your name? Šarlota. Šarlota who? Vihárová. It's not funny to say that. It's true. -She's a ghost. -Sure, Adam, a ghost. If it's true, then prove it! -Jura! -Don't get too close. Careful. -Go get it. -You go. Dear Šarlota Vihárová, you are summoned by the mayor's office for the inheritance proceedings of Alžbeta Vihárová… -Hey! -Hey! Drop it! -I'm just going-- -Drop the axe! -Stop! -Let go! No! Mira! What the fuck? I thought you were scared of the witch's cabin. What the fuck are you doing here? Mira, watch out, she says she's Šarlota Vihárová. Is it alright if I spend the night here? I don't know. The witch dropped a tree on the last person that stayed here. So, where's the witch? Nobody knows. -What? -Something's there! -I heard some weird noise! -Really? -Hey! -Watch out! -Hey! -Let's get out of here! -Mira! Where are you? -Let's go, Helena! -Mira! -Fuck her, let's go! We can't leave her here! Mira! -It's not working at all. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. I'm here for my mother's inheritance proceeding. -And you are? -Vihárová. Šarlota. Did you hear that? Do you have any ID? Here. This is the letter I got from the mayor. -It's today's date. -How is this possible? Just a second, please. Alright, keep the letter. The mayor is out of town. He'll be back after Easter during office hours. But the letter says today. He isn't here, we can't help you. Next week. Well, where is he? -We're sorry. Bye. -Bye. -Do you think it's really her? -No way. …offer a complete range of masonry services. Including grave installation, lining and siding of older graves using natural stone memorial urns, vases and the best selection of other products for the lowest prices in the region. Hello. Hi. Anna. Anna Škutová? God, you remember me? You used to live at the edge of the village, right? It is you. I'm sorry, I can't believe it. How did you survive? We looked all over for you. I ran away to the city. God! Why didn't you come back before? You were scared of her, weren't you? Who? That witch Otyla. Stop, bitch! Your mother and I tried to make her confess what she had done to you and your poor sister. God, look how you've grown. You have her eyes. Do you know how my mom's cabin burned down? Mom! I got the bread rolls. Helena told me you were staying in Otyla's cabin. You can't be there, I'd never forgive myself. Come stay with us. Thank you for the offer. Šarlota, if you need anything… -You know where to find us. -Thank you. INCOMING CALL Wait… -Come here… -Wait… Elo, Maťo! Leave that chicken alone! Go help your mother! Why? No talking back! Go! No! Are you nuts? What are you doing? Getting a tan. You should try it. It's good for your period. I'm Mira. The sun can burn you, but the moon is different… It's like a caress. Won't you take off your clothes? I'm cold. You hungry? So, he thinks you're still in Bratislava? I guess. He thinks I'm just sulking. Are you? Well… I emailed him that since he couldn't bother coming home after my hernia surgery, he shouldn't bother coming home at all. So what's the problem? Fuck him. -What? -Otyla. Can you hold this? It used to be mine. She used to have a baby bear inside. But I found this instead. My sister used to steal her from me. I don't understand how it got here. It's a child's tooth. And that gross old braid… Are you scared of hair? I don't know. A little, I guess. Touch it, then. What else is there? Maybe she really was a witch. CHAPTER 2 - THE VILLAGE Come on… Come on, lads, hurry up… Jesus, no. I hate this custom. -That's enough! -Let's go, guys! Did you thank your uncle? Those water guns must have been expensive! -Žofa! -You didn't have to. I owe you an Easter egg. If only your brother was so thoughtful! -What? -No, not me… Stop it! What's wrong with you? -Stop it! -Don't I get an Easter egg? You promised not to get this dress wet! Stop it! Tomáš, let's have a drink! -Hello, neighbors! -Hi, there! Hi… -Hi, Helena! -Cheers! -You won't rot away… -Tomáš! -Help us, please… -What the fuck is this? -Tomáš, grab that bucket! -Let me show you! Thank you, lads! They're coming here. Lock the door. Mira! Mira, open the door! -Open the door! -Open the door! I can totally see you! Look who's in here! No, don't! Don't! -Tomáš, grab her legs! -Wait! -Come here! -Stop it… Hold her! Come! Hold her! Slow down… Stop it, Tomáš! Let go of me! It's dangerous, you fucking idiots! -Stop it! It's dangerous! -And go! Throw her in, too! Come on! Are you insane? Kicking a child? I should kill you! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. You didn't, my ass! -Mira, wait. -Leave me alone! Ouch! -Sorry. -Be careful, please. You're a nurse. Why don't you remove them yourself? I don't know. It feels gross doing it to myself, I guess. I have no idea who sent me that letter. What letter? About my inheritance. I wouldn't worry about that. No one's gonna tell you anything. People don't talk about things around here. How did you end up here? I wanted to get a place back East where I'm from. But real estate was much cheaper here because the place is haunted, right? It's perfect for me here. The woods are all I need. What do you mean? Because of the herbs. I can sell a kilo for 150 euros. It's a lot of work, but still. -All done. -Thank you. Jesus! -What? -It's Juro. "You're like a Porsche 930 Turbo with nothing but Fiats around." Idiot. Are you dating him? Nah, I'm just sleeping with him. I mean, not just him. -Who else? -Whoever I want. -Take these pajamas. -Thanks. Well, lucky you. When I'm in love, I can only have sex with that person. Glad that never happened to me. Not even with a woman? What are you suggesting? No! Wait… That's for hemorrhoids. This is the magic scar cream. -Fifteen euros. -Here, take it. Open the door. Not tonight. Wait. Give me your hand, I'll pull you up. What? This is where it happened. What? This is where I last saw Tamara. I was running away from home and she was behind me, as always. Wait for me! Leave me alone, Tamara! …and said: "This is Grgolica's cave!" Are you okay? -Where are you going? -Back to the cabin. Come on, let's get back inside. Calm down, it's alright. Breathe. Breathe. Look at me. Look at me. Keep looking at me. Let's breathe together, okay? Breathe in… Lie down. Breathe with me. Let's breathe together, okay? …he'd always tell me to calm down but that just made it worse… I was totally unable to control it. What do you actually want? What? What do you want from life? I don't know. A family, I guess. So, kids? One, two? One for now. Then I'll see. I'll see what it's like. I'm not sure if I'd make a good mother. You know, my mom… I don't want to be like her. -Maybe it's stupid. -What? Maybe having kids is a stupid idea. When people see a child, they usually feel something. When I see a child, I feel nothing. I don't know. It's weird. What's weird about that? I should feel something as a woman. So, as a woman, you should want to have kids? No. I don't know. -Everybody says… -Fuck everybody! -But I- -Do you want kids? -No. -So don't have them. I didn't want it. What? The baby. That's why it happened. I didn't want him, so he died inside me. I killed him. You know? No, I don't, actually. Jesus, Mira. I had a miscarriage. I see. So it wasn't a hernia. But it wasn't like I got pregnant and then it happened, but… We had been trying for two years. And when I got pregnant, everything was fine, he was growing, 21 weeks, 300 grams… And then something went wrong, because I couldn't even do that right. I couldn't even keep a baby alive. I fuck up everything. No wonder he left me. What an asshole. Leaving you alone after a miscarriage? You don't understand. It was me who fucked up. Not him. I lied to myself. -Šarlota… -I lied to him. I killed my baby! And I killed my sister! Šarlota! I'm sorry! I didn't… CHAPTER 3 - THE WILD CHILD Aren't you scared, staying here alone? -I am. -So why don't you leave? Nothing to inherit, it all burned down. Who burned my mom's cabin? Otyla? Don't say her name, you might awaken her. At least she might tell me what happened. She cursed this place, that's what happened. -Why would she curse her own cabin? -Because… Because this is where they took the child from her. What child? It wasn't really a child. It was wild, biting everyone, couldn't even speak. Could you hand it to me, please? Helena! It's just a snake. So you wouldn't mind me smashing your head in… you're just a human. Finish it. Finish what you've started! Snakes have no soul. Helena, wait! What happened to the child? -Helena! -What child? -She said Otyla had a wild child. -Oh, please. -Good morning. -So? Will you stay at ours? You don't wanna live like a gypsy… Praise the Lord. That's Fero. Do you remember him, Šarlota? Good morning. Šarlota looked different. Of course she did! She's a woman now! Helena… -Can you tell me more about that child? -No. Are you mad at me? No. Helena! Wait! Where are you going? None of your business. I need to know, it could've been my sister. Everything's about you, huh? Wait! Mira is my friend. What? Since you came here, she hates me. That's nonsense. It's true. Wait. Helena! You've never told her? Of course not. Don't you dare say anything. -I'd rather risk rejection… -Shut up! Stop talking about it. -Mira might also like women. -Shut up! Would about that child? What? What child? The wild one. What happened to it? Could it have been Tamara? I don't know. They took it away somewhere. I never saw it. Jesus, there you are, Anna is freaking out, I've been looking all over… -Mira! -Jesus. Okay, stand up. Come on. Jesus Christ! What did you do to her? Helena! Get away from her! Let me help you. Helena, come on. Jesus! Mira, could you check on my goat? -Come! -Boys, go inside! Are you that witch? Stop. Never seen a witch who doesn't know how to sharpen a scythe. -I'm not a witch. -Of course you are. How else could you summon me here? Hold on. May I? Sure. The other way. Grab it here. No… Almost. All the way to the end. The other side. Now you go. Good. That's it. Hello. Changed your mind? About staying here? No, but don't worry about me. I'm sorry if it bothers you, but I need to know where the wild child is. Jesus, enough already. Šarlota, I don't know anything. What are you doing? Give it back. What happened? Why did my mom's cabin burn down? Because she saw that gypsy bitch going into the woods. Who did? Your mother saw her… during full moons, a whole coven dancing naked by the fire, and God knows what else. Give me the goose! Alright? Where's the child? Was it Tamara? I'm not telling you anything! I'll do it. Piss of! The witch killed Tamara after you escaped from her. I escaped from my mom. She was beating me. Such a sin… Your mother waited too long. But our Lord made her pay for it. Waited for what? Baptism. Witches only take unbaptized children… sacrifice them and bathe in their blood, so they'll stay young forever. But if they steal a baptized child, they raise it as their own. That was why the witch came here, settled down, and waited. Waited for what? For another unbaptized child. So you're saying Tamara was murdered by witches? Believe me or not, but everyone knows that it didn't end with Tamara. She had to get rid of your poor mother, too. Why? They were neighbors for ages. So that she could raise the wild child! She couldn't do it with your mother around! At least tell me where the wild child is now, I need to make sure it's not Tamara. I've had enough of this. This needs to end. What do you want from us anyway? Trust me, I tried to protect you. But you just wouldn't listen. We found that where those witches used to meet. -What is this? -She was handling the goose. Get out of here! Mira, don't! She's a witch! -Let me go! -Please don't! -Helena, let go! Go home! -Stay here. CHAPTER 4 - OTYLA Otyla? Hey. So, Helena was right. Good morning, witch. Hold on. Here you go. It wasn't Fero's size. Motherfucker. What's his problem with you? -What is this? -Ribleaf. I pull my hair out. You do what? It's a disorder. Like when people bite their nails, I pull out my hair out. And this is willow. For the pain. My grandma's recipe, it really works. Why were you so upset before? You already knew your sister was dead, didn't you? Before… I don't know. It happened a long time ago. But now it feels like it's happening all over again. Right now. But even if she were alive, you hated her anyway, so I don't understand what your problem is. No, you don't understand. Of course you don't. So why don't you shut up? Okay, I'll shut up. Take it out on me if it makes you feel better. You know what makes me feel better? -This. -Stop it. Stop it or I'll leave. So, leave. Leave! -Šarlota. -Get out of here! Okay. Mira? Mira. -What did you do to her? -Nothing! What do you mean? You've seen what they do to chicken and geese. You should've called the vet! Shut up or I'll smack you too! -Who did this to her? -I didn't do anything! Who did this to her? -I didn't do anything! -What the fuck? I see. Kids and women, right? What a man! -So what? -Mind your own business! Wait till you have kids of your own! -Who did this to the goat? -It was Mira! She's a witch! …100 euros for that …if you don't answer. You're playing for his money. These are the topics: Slovak fiction, folk songs… Never seen a pussy before? Don't fuck with me, bitch. Me? Never. It'd probably make me puke… …and that would just turn you on, like beating women and kids. Loser. Ouch! No! What are you doing? I'm coming. What the fuck are you doing? We're husband and wife, aren't we? Come here, Jožo! Come here, buddy. Come here. Good boy. Sit! Sit! Down! Great! Heel! Beta? Beta! Beta! I found Tamara! Beta! CHAPTER 5 - MIDSUMMER NIGHT -Cheers! -Cheers! -I don't believe you fucked her. -Sure did, in her own house. -Look! -Speak of the devil! Mira, will you fuck me too? Come on, I'll lick you all over! 4.80 euros, please. -A simple question for you… -Five. Make it five. -Don't be shy! -Show us your snatch! -Come over here! -Show us your treasure trove! Where have you been, slut? Nipples you can hang your coat on. Is she shaven down there? Dad! Come with us! Leave me alone. It's a jungle down there. I'm talking here. Dad, they won't let us ride the ATV! Get lost… Get lost or I'll smack you! Can't you see I'm talking? Look at you two! -Cheers, my friends. -Cheers! Here's to you. Ugh, what's that? It's my love potion. Helena! Wait up! Let's dance. -To this? -Yeah. Come on. Come on! -It's gonna be fun! -Well… -I don't know… -Come on! Come here… -Let's dance! -Really? Yes. Let's go! Let's go! Elo! Maťo! Tomáš, where are the kids? Elo! Maťo! Where are you? I can't find them… What the fuck? What do you expect when you dance like a whore? Bitch, when will you leave us alone? He grabbed me. I was defending myself. I guess you're all just used to it. We're decent people. Unlike you. Sure. Decent God-fearing wife and child beaters. What? Go in peace, Amen. You killed Žofa's goat! -And you cursed the goose! -Elo! And who knows what else, you bald bitch! Maťo! Fuck her. It looks like a can opener. -Where? -There. Where? Mira, what did you put into those shots? Well, it's my S.O.T. -Your what? -Shot Of Truth. Son of Trouble. Soda on truck. Soup on titties. Do you see it? Yeah. You can't even tell where I'm pointing! Whoever gets caught, gets fucked! Let's go! Wait! Wait for me! What's wrong? What is it? What happened? CHAPTER 6 - SISTER Tamara. You going to push me off the cliff? One. Two. Three. Four. Are you crazy? Why would I do that? You must hate me. Why didn't you tell me? I was scared. That… I don't know. That you'd run away again. I'm sorry. Fuck! -Should I call the police? -No, wait. My computer's here. The money… -I think it was that asshole. -Who? Tomáš. Take it off, I'll put it in the wash. There are some dry clothes over there. DEAR ŠARLOTA VIHÁROVÁ, YOU ARE SUMMONED TO ATTEND INHERITANCE… Give me your dress. Alright, I sent you the letter. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. SEČOVCE ORPHANAGE How long did it take you to find me? Twenty years. After you ran away, I lived with Otyla for a while… Hold on, with Otyla? Well, I… Why didn't you go back home? Well… After the fall, when I woke up at Otyla's… Don't be scared. It's alright. I went home. Mom was hanging there. Touch it. Feel how dry its skin is. Žofa! Žofa, go get Anna! We found Helena under the cliff! -Where are Elo and Maťo? -We didn't find them. What do you mean, you didn't find them?! There's no sign of them. We looked everywhere. -Helena! -Get her out of the rain! -Mira, call an ambulance! -Okay. Hello? Is this the police? Žofa Smahová speaking. I called earlier. Yes, it's about the missing children. They're still missing. My husband's just got back, he couldn't find them. Hang in there. God! What happened? -Take her inside! -We can't move her now. -Don't touch her! -I'm a certified nurse! You can't touch her! She'll bleed to death! Please, help me! She mustn't touch her, she's evil! She's going to die! Helena! Žofa! Bring me blessed salt! I already told you, they were playing by the bonfire before they disappeared. Let go of me! You can't be serious. -You haven't even left the station? -Fuck, I can't believe it! -The salt! -Shut the fuck up! I don't have any! The ambulance will be here in a minute. Helena! Don't touch her! Tomáš! Get away from her! Get away! Get away, bitch! You too! Back off or I'll kill you! Move it! Back off! Back the fuck off! Get out of here! They killed her, the bitches! Mira! Where are my children? CHAPTER 7 - WITCHES Maťo! Elo! Boys! -Maťo! -We're wasting our time here. They have them. You saw what they're capable of. Maťo! The cops won't help us. You've called them twice, they don't give a shit. Maťo! -When did the cops ever help anyone? -Elo! Žofa! -Come on, Žofa. -Maťo! Žofa! -Okay, but we'll just check the cabin. -Adam, Juro, come here! Rado isn't picking up. Mira. We should go. -Get up! Get out of the bed! -Jožka, come here. Get in the corner! Move it! Mira, get over here! Hold her! Get down! -Get off of her! -Shut the fuck up! They're not here. What are you doing? You promised you wouldn't hurt them! -What are you looking for? -Stop the act! We know you took them! What did we take? So it's true. I didn't want to believe it. What's that? A sonogram? I'm their mother. Do you know how scared I am? I don't know what you're talking about. Give it back. You took Elo and Maťo. -Tell us what you've done with them. -Hold on. So, what's this? Are you pregnant? No. You can't have your own children, so you took mine. That's crazy, Žofa. I didn't take your kids. Take off your clothes. Fucking do it! Keep going! -Where are they? -I don't know. What? Wanna help her? We know nothing about your kids! They ran away because you beat them! You fucking asshole! Where are my kids? Where are they? You fucking whore! Where are they? Stop it! We have to go look for them! Come, Jožo! -You stay with them. -I'm not staying alone with them! -Somebody's gotta watch them. -I'm coming with you. Žofa, only you can make them confess. If they're out in the woods, I swear I'll find them. Adam, let's go. Get dressed. Do you hear me? Can I remove her gag? Are you serious? Žofa, I know you're worried about your kids, -but this is so fucked up. -Quiet. You really think that we're some evil witches? Move. To the table. Move it. What a superhero! Pointing a gun at two tied-up girls. Are you hard yet? What? Shut up, okay? Don't be ashamed. There's a lot of impotent… Shut up! That vein on your forehead looks like it's gonna burst. What were you gonna name him? Was he dead at birth? What do you want? It must've been awful. It must be awful to live with a wife beater. What do you know? I know what it's like when you can't leave someone. But I don't want to leave anyone. God united us for better or for worse. Okay… Men are all the same anyway. Listen, if you tell me where my kids are, I'll let you go. Tomáš won't find you here. I promise. I'm going to the outhouse, watch them. Fuck. What do you see? -Where? -There, on the ground! Grass. Elo! Maťo! Fuck! -Stop! -Ow! Juro! Don't! Stop! Get up! Move it! Jesus, Žofa! Fuck! Hang on! -I'll help you. -Don't touch me! -Come, let's go. -Stop it! I'm so sorry. Fuck. I'll get help! Hang on! Elo! Maťo! Tomáš! What happened? What did they do to you? Tomáš, come back! Where are you going? Is she okay? Juro went to get help. Untie me, I can help. You shouldn't have done that. -Done what? -Tomáš! What are you doing? We need to help Žofa, untie me! Tomáš! No! You can't do that. Tomáš, don't! Tomáš! Where are you going? Tomáš! Tomáš! Help me! Help! Fuck! Fuck! No, no, no! Help! Help! -Mira! -Wait! She's not breathing. Mira! Get up. Mira! Mira, breathe! Mira, please, breathe! Mira! Come on! Mira! Hey, get back in line!
