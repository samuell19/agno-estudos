Viva Pancho! (1941) Come on, cows. Come on, Red. Keep them moving. Did you have any water left? Mine is over. Hey, boss, what do you say we stop by the ranch to eat and smoke? Stop? We'll just stop at the border. Why do you want to kill? Lopez is not attacking here. - How do you know where he is, Red? - Listen, Gil. You've been a little scared lately. You are no longer the same. - Is something wrong? - No, let's move on. Is it because the men leave and do not receive a salary? Do not. It's because the bank didn't lend you money against cattle For being afraid that Lopez will attack here? Do not. Is it the mortgage that will expire next month? Don't be an imbecile. It's all right. I thought something was worrying you. Come on, cattle. To the border. What is wrong with Uncle Henry? He knows we won't have lunch. He must be in trouble, as he keeps ringing the bell. Hey, maybe it's Lopez. It is better to go there. I think it's the only way to silence him. Keep the pack moving. I reach you. - Uncle Henry, what happened? - Dismount this horse. It's all right. What was it this time? Do you want me to hold your hand or comb your hair? - Push me to the corral. - Is that why you called me? Lopez has been attacking ranches around here and you know very well that if we lose our cattle, we will lose this place. Now, you pretended old man. You can get there faster than me. Wait a minute, young man. We have a guest. Who? Have you ever heard of a Maine girl named Lucia? Lucia? Where? I'm sorry for calling you. Perhaps it is better to return to the pack. After all, what is a girl compared to a herd of cows? Okay, shut up. Where is she? In the corral. Hey, wait a minute! There is something else! You damn fool. Lucia. - I didn't think it was possible. - What didn't you think was possible? You look better, but you did. - Let go of me, Gil. - Oh no. I'm just trying to decide where to give you the first kiss. - But you can't... - Who said that? I think I'll try here. Is here. If you are not tired, here. - Should I call someone? - Who are you? That's what I tried to tell you, he's my husband. Your husband? Hey, I'm sorry. I did not know. No way. In fact, you have good taste. My name is Morgan Pell. Apparently, you must be an old friend of my wife. My name is Gil Jones. You should have told me. Well, you should have given me a chance. She's right, old man. You were impetuous. Not that I blame you. But I'm glad I didn't take too long - five more minutes. - Well, I've known her since I was a girl. So, is it Mrs. Pell now? No chance of divorce? - I'm afraid not. - You know, we got engaged when - she was nine years old. - Eight. Hey, you went wrong, didn't you? You found out that she's married, didn't you? That's what I tried to tell you, you bloody idiot. Running like a bull in a boat. It's Lopez. Take them home, quickly. - Who's Lopez? - The worst thug in Mexico. Let's go. Get in the house! Come on, get out of here. Let's go. - May I help you. - No way. Just get out of the way. Don't get out of there. Uncle Henry? Someone? Move. The chief was shot. I will kill you for that, Lopez. Hey, Gilly. Gilly, my boy. - Gilly. - Stop this. - Why don't you and Red do something? - Uncle Henry, stop yelling. Morgan, see if you can find any bandages. Where do you keep your medicines? - In the kitchen. - Call the doctor. I can not do this. I saw Lopez cutting the wires. So get on your horse and go get it. Curse. 5 years of work and sweat, and you had to be shot. I've never seen such bad luck. I didn't want to bring you here. It looks like it didn't stand a chance. Damn cows. Why didn't you let him take them? I would have given you the ranch too. Hey, Lucia. Red? Won't they help you? What will they do? - Will they let you die here? - Uncle Henry, you have to be silent - or get out of here. - It's all right. A man has no rights in his own home. Bring water. - How serious is it? - It was on his shoulder, I can't tell you. Did we lose the pack? Be silent, Gil. Hi Lucia. Hi, Gil. - You got married, didn't you? - Be silent. Any man who can smile like that is not seriously injured. - He'll survive, won't he? - Of course yes. - But he will need rest. - There will be plenty of time for that. - You lost the pack, didn't you? - Yes. I suppose you know we’re going to lose the ranch too? Yes. Don't just stand there... I mean, don't just lie there answering me "yes". Why didn't you shoot? If I could ride, we would have dinner at Lopez. Of course, I know. We just have problems. I must have been born on the wrong side of the bed. I don't know why I came to this place. I liked Maine. It was happy in Maine. God knows I was happy there, but I had to buy this Mexican sandbox. I fell off the horse and I'm in that damn chair this time. Then Gil shows up and spends my last cents raising cattle. Then we lose the cattle and he is shot. Now the mortgage will expire and we will lose the ranch. Why don't we set the house on fire, kill the horses, do we shoot each other and end the day? Uncle Henry, you have the disposition of a scorpion. Pay no attention to him. I should have heard it when they brought it. - He's just pretending now. - Now, the minute I saw him, I knew it was just a scratch. Now, when I was his age... - I think it's better to go out and calm down. - I don't want to calm down. - Then wait for the doctor. - Why is he taking so long? I should have gone myself. I didn't want to do that. It's all right. I think I'm scared. You had a bad day. It was difficult for Gil, but he will be better in a few days. Just like you. Yes, but I think we better stay until he feels better. - He'll need care. - Of course. The nights here are different from New York, aren't they? Yes, they seem to give you more time to think. Truth. I've been thinking. We've been together for two years. It's been really good and I would hate to see something ruin that. Morgan, what's wrong? I had a strange feeling that you are in love with Gil. I think it was because I felt sorry for him. When you see someone you care about for years in danger like that for helping Uncle Henry, you can't help but feel affection for him. I always thought we could talk about anything. Why are we that kind of person. - Do you mind? - Of course not. You were never deeply in love with me. I understood that. At least, he thought he understood until he saw her looking at him. You looked at him in a way you never looked at me. When I saw it, I realized that I would hate to lose it. Morgan, you stood by me when I needed help. I can't forget that. Love and gratitude are probably not that different. I have no problem with our marriage, Morgan. - That is the question. - Thanks. FOR SALE - TALK TO OWNER HENRY JONES Stop talking about overdue wages. He has nothing else to suggest. - Well, we don't. - Why don't you stop talking about it? You're making me feel so bad that I'm going to take a shot of tequila. Red is crazy. This land took him. - Got us too. - I've never seen such bad luck. Do you know where I would like to be now? I would like to be taking care of my lobster traps. I wonder what a lobster will taste like. I ate so much beans that I ended up forgetting. Well, we tried. I think only a bullshit could survive in this place. - I don't know if it's the fault of the place. - I want to go back to a place where it gets cold now and then. I'm tired of cactus and sand. Why are you talking about this place? He belongs to me and I like him. Do you have a match? A place like this with a little luck and someone who shoots straight, and he would be worth a fortune. What do you want to do? Go back to Maine and smell the fish the rest of your life? You like it here, no, you old whine? Old Hardy will take it from you tonight. I'm sorry I can't do anything. Yes, there is something you can do. You can marry Angela Hardy. That old vulture would never run his son-in-law's debt. - Marry Angela Hardy? - Sure. Why don't you marry her? I admit that she is not very smart, but this is not necessary in this part of the country. If she has good teeth and healthy lungs... - But I don't like Angela. - Who asked you to like her? I asked you to marry her. Shut up. Hi, Gil. Hello, Uncle Henry. Welcome to the funeral. - Is this really the end? - Yes, tonight, at 8 pm. When Hardy learned that we lost the cattle, he refused to renew the debt. I'm sorry, Gil. - Seriously, Uncle Heny. If you're sorry, why don't you ask your husband to buy the ranch? He'll buy a place, won't he? - I guess so. - I know you do. You came to spend two days and are already in that city hotel a month ago. - And he's been visiting ranches. - I know you've been doing this, but he is a businessman. I cannot interfere. Uncle Henry, why don't you mind your own business? I have no life. It's over. I'll take care of yours for a change. I'll talk to Pell when he comes to get you. You won't do any of that. You can't ask a man to sink money in a place like that. Damn it not. You did it, you insolent. - I created a rope to bite me. - What will you do, Gil? I do not know. Morgan is finalizing his business. We should be back in New York in a few days. - I don't know much about New York. - You'd love to. - I've always liked it here. - Yes, this is a good place too. Of course, it's not a place for a woman. I knew the first time I saw him, that a man would be a fool if you asked a woman to live here. Of course, if the man wanted to find out, he would have asked the woman. Not if you liked her. It seems to me that such a man thinks he is always right. It is possible that a woman would prefer to raise a family in such a place instead of dying of loneliness in a place like Maine. Perhaps. Usually someone shows up to end loneliness. I suppose so. The woman would probably accept him, even marry him. Always remembering that you missed the opportunity to love. If she found that out, she could leave him, right? Not if he loved her. Not if he had been nice and kind to her. Not if she couldn't be able to live with herself afterwards. I understand. Well, it might help if she knew that the man who wouldn't ask to live in this land, I always wanted to. I would probably still do that if things were different. - Would that help? - Quite. I think I better go. Here comes old Hardy behind the carrion. - Tell us where you'll be, Gil. - Sure, you bet. Well, you better go talk to Hardy. Uncle Henry may end up shooting him. You know Uncle Henry. Here's a gift for you, if you want. We call him Adios. - How are you, Mr. Hardy? - Hello, Red. - Hello, Angela. - Hello, Red. - Where's Gilbert? - It's in the corral. Hey, Angela, does your dad have any good news for the boss? - Please don't bother me, Red. - I won't propose again. I know you're crazy about the boss. Well, me too. I thought you could make your dad take it easy. - Hi, Gil. - Hi, Gil. - Well, what to say? - No, Dad, you... Angela, leave me alone. This is business. - I just want you to be kind. - How am I going to be kind to something like that? That's easy. Just don't take the ranch from him. For the love of... Red, can you take her for a walk? - It will be a pleasure. - But we already have enough ranches. Do as I say. Go for a walk. So, I guess you don't have the money? I do not have. He is yours. Simple as that, huh? So you have nothing more to say? - Nothing that interest. - I have. - His daughter wants to marry him. - What you mean? - Who told you that? - She told me. And if he weren't a fool, he would take my advice... Push me, Gil. Can you do me this favor? - Be silent. - Maybe I can convince you. - Convince you to what? - To marry her. - I don't want him to marry her. - Do not want? - Of course not. - Why, he's my nephew. That is the main reason. Another thing, I want his ranch, - not him. - Look here, Jasper Hardy. My nephew is one of the best guys in Mexico. You just called him a fool. Do you think I want my daughter to marry a fool? Yes! Do not. You two deserve this. Wait a minute. There is so much traffic here that it is better to open a hamburger stand. I can get my money back like that. - Hello, Uncle Henry. - Hi. Gil. Hi, Hardy. - You dropped something. - Thanks. Hello dear. I have news that may please you. - Has? - I know you're worried that your friends miss the ranch and I found a way to help them. I would like to discuss business with you, Gil. - In there. - We're out of business, unless you want to buy the ranch. That's what I'm talking about. - It's still yours, isn't it? - Until 8 at night. - Then it's his. - Great. There is enough time. Come on in, Gil. Hey, wait a minute. Uncle Henry, aren't you going in? You better hurry up. Yes I'm already going. As far as I know, the mortgage is $ 10,000. That's right. What is your part? Another $ 10,000. - My $ 10,000. - What about $ 20,000? This will pay the mortgage. And you will recover your $ 10,000. Would you give us $ 20,000 for the ranch, with no cattle on it? Exactly. You accept? - You bet. - Why, Morgan, this is wonderful. No way. They are our friends, aren't they? - Closed? - Yes. Wait a minute. - You can not do that. - Why not? This ranch is practically mine and you will get me out of it. - That's my specialty. - I won't accept that. I've been waiting for this place for five years. Why do you care? You will get your money, won't you? - What do you want with another ranch? - Well, what does he want with him? - That's what I want to know. - Me too. Let's go to town before the bank closes. We're wasting time. - And I'm missing a ranch. - What the hell. Hey, Gilly. Look here. - What is it? - A bag of soil from Pell. - Earth? - Yes. Remember the holes that Red saw Pell digging? Why were you digging those holes, Pell? Well, just... To test the soil and see what I should plant. There is no way to plant anything, not even stone. Were you not in the oil business, Mr. Pell? - Of course not. - Why, Morgan... Please, dear, let me handle this. - So you're in the oil business? - This is ridiculous. There is no oil in this sample. You can smell it. I can not. My sense of smell is not good. - Morgan, is there oil here? - This has nothing to do. Why can't I buy the ranch if I want to? - They will lose anyway. - But it can be worth millions. Who is this woman and why is she getting into it? I'll tell you who she is. She is his wife, but you are in love with him. That's why you're getting into it. - What did you say? - Keep quiet, Uncle Henry. He couldn't marry her and he didn't want to marry her. I think I have a right to protect myself, don't I? Gil, I can't believe this is true. Well, he won't admit it. He's a gentleman. And that is what has kept it broken. But it's true. Just look at them. - You only talk nonsense. - And you're a fool. Jones, I admit that there is a possibility of oil on this ranch. I'll give you $ 20,000 and pay off the mortgage. - $ 20,000? - Yes. - Do you have it? - Yes. And we can close a deal right now. Look here, Gilbert. My daughter always said that you are a gentleman. And if it is, you will not sign the document. That wouldn't be courteous to Mr. Pell, would it? And he has been so generous. Here it is. Sign here. - Gilbert, don't do this. - Give me a pen. - Thanks. - You can't sign that. - Please wait. - I promised my uncle that would get him out of here one day. The day has come. - Let's go to the city to prepare the deed. - How about paying me? You will receive in the bank, as soon as I recover the mortgage and the deal is cleared. Clean. How can you do that? This is the dirtiest deal I've ever seen. I find it difficult, Mr. Hardy. Come on, Gil. See you, Lucia. Gil, my boy, God bless you. Just a moment, Morgan. I can't let you do that. Seriously? I need to ask you not to interfere in my business. But you've never done anything like this before. - Or did? - Lucia, silence. I'm taking care of that, understand? Morgan, I never saw you do that. You are a stranger. Curse. As we have a problem. I'm an old man, the ranch is gone and I have nowhere to go. Gil loves Lucia. Angela loves Gil. Red loves Angela. Lucia loves Gil. And Pell loves Lucia. Nobody can marry anyone. Nobody is happy and nobody knows how to solve this mess. - Where are the weapons? - In the barn. Bring me my rifle. - Who are these men? - Lopez! - Lopez? - Yes, Lopez. You are my prisoners. Keep a lookout. Search all the rooms, lock them all. Cut the phone line, shoot the cars, take the horses. Watch out. My brake is broken. Come on, guys. - Venustian. - Yes, boss? Find the cook. I'm hungry. Yes, boss. - Pedro. - Yes sir? - Bring the women here. - The women? - Yes, bring them. - Right now. Chief Lopez wants to see you outside. Let's go. You too. - Just two women? - The cook left. It's all right. I forgot that I'm hungry. - Come here. - I? Do not. No you do not. - You, come here. - Come on! - What you want with me? - I want to look at you. Turn around. - How old is? - 25. You are too old. - Show your teeth. - What? You heard me, the teeth. What you use to eat. Open your mouth wide. More. - How much do you weigh? - 47 kilos. You are very thin. It is better to put on weight. - What is your name? - Lucia. Lucia? That is a beautiful name. Here, come here. Come here. Good... Temperamental, huh? Well, I like that. What do you think about going to Chihuahua with me? - What? - Did you hear me. What do you think about going to Chihuahua with me? - I wouldn't like that. - Why not? - I'm married to begin with. - Well, we won't take your husband. It will be just the two of us. We will go to Chihuahua and steal a jewelry for you. Then we will be drunk in bullfights. Let's have fun, huh? What it says? Still, I wouldn't like it. Hey, what's the matter with you? Never took you out for fun? Yes, but I don't think it's fun. Yes, you'll be married to the same man your whole life, huh? - Only one. - Your life must be terrible. You never have fun. If I were old, I would understand. But you are young and beautiful. Hey, why the hell were you born if you don't want to live? I want to live, but we have fun differently, that's all. Yes, but my way is better. It will be fun to teach you how to enjoy life with me. We'll start right now. You will serve me in the kitchen, I'm hungry. Come on, to the kitchen. - Jose, protect this. - Yes sir. Why is your hand shaking? Are you afraid of me? Do not. The girl with the spirit, huh? Difficult to tame, like a wild horse. Lift the pot. - I want to taste the food. - Careful, it's hot. Not for Lopez. Maybe for your husband, but not for me. Hey, why are you afraid of me? - Because I heard you kill people. - But that's not true. Not? What makes you think that? Well, it couldn't be true. Well, you're wrong. I kill. Do you think it is wrong to kill people? Does life mean that little to you? Life. Life is living, not dying. Life only matters if it is lived. But you kill helpless people, prisoners, like us. - Sure. - That's cold-blooded. Maybe you think so. This is just the difference between danger and safety. In security, you pay the debt and it is forgotten. In danger, you have the enemy to kill. You kill him and he is forgotten. - This is horrible. - Is life. Sit down. Not you! Sugar, please. I only kill men. Bad men. When I kill bad men, it makes me happy. - Because I did something good. - But who decides whether they are good or bad? I decide. You think that's awful, huh? That is why he never lived in a free country. - But I live in a free country. - How can you say that? You live in the least free country in the world. Every man and woman is a slave. You have to sleep at the right time, wake up at the right time, eat on time. And worst of all, every Saturday, you bathe at the right time. All are prisoners of the law... Sit down. Well, I suppose a man in your position cannot believe in the laws. I believe in the best laws, the ones I make myself. - Isn't that a little confusing? - Not in a free country. I was in your country once. I got drunk and the waiter hit me in the head. When I get drunk in my country, I hit the head waiter. That's better. The weather is lovely, isn't it? - Sugar, please. - Yes, thank you. Tell me. Have you ever known the joy of a fearless life? No, I didn't know. That is, not exactly. - But it must be exciting. - I wasn't talking to you. - Was not? - Not. - But you're not angry, are you? - It's not that I'm nervous with you, is that you piss me off. - You pushed my face. - You should keep your face at home. The heart leaps the way I live. The soul is free. You will see this when we arrive in Chihuahua City. You will be very happy. But I'm not going with you. What kind of woman are you? I've never been so kind to a woman. And you say you will not go with me? Your husband must be very charming, huh? - Pedro. - Yes, boss? - Bring the prisoners. - Right. - Is your husband one of them? - Not. Not? I'll find out soon. Lucia, you will forget about your wedding when we are in Chihuahua, huh? Look here. You are talking to my wife. I told you I would find him quickly. She is a good wife. I want to have it for myself. Look here, Lopez. If it's money you want, - I'll give you $ 1,000 to get out of here. - Silence! You will speak when I ask. Only then will he respond. Whoever does not do this will be shot. Except Lucia here. I have other plans for her. Now we will do business. - You only have $ 1,000, huh? - Yes, every penny. - Maybe your friend here has more. - I'm a poor man, Mr. Lopez. - Survive with little. - That's a shame. - Are you her father? - Yes. This is much worse. You're a cowboy, huh? - Yes. - You are a happy man, but he has no money. I used to be a cowboy and I know that. That's all the money I have. They took everything else, $ 10,000. - They are worse bandits than you. - $ 10,000? - That's true? - No, it is not. I think someone is lying. Whoever lies is evil. I kill those who are bad. Pedro, shoot the head of the first to lie. - Right. - I hope he's the first. - Do you want him dead? - For sure. - Because? - I told you, he took us $ 10,000. That's true? Did you steal $ 10,000 from him? Well, his ranch mortgage is due today. Let's go. Tell me why you want the ranch so badly. Let's go. I challenge you. You old fool, do you want to cause us trouble? I've been in trouble for the past 5 years. I want to see you get your share. I have nothing to lose. You took my ranch and it will take your money. God be praised. I would be the happiest man in the world if he shot you both. So, maybe I would get my million dollars back. The more I think, but I know that Mr. Lopez's idea exactly matches mine. You say a million dollars was stolen from you, huh? Let's go. Ask them. And I hope one of them will lie. - Did he tell the truth? - Well, I was going... Point to it. He will lie. I thought there might be oil here. - Petroleum? - Yes. But since the mortgage hasn't been paid yet, the place belongs to him. - Or maybe Mr. Hardy. - How is it? Making one or the other a very rich man. So, maybe you keep the money, huh? How would I keep the money if the place is mortgaged? And the only one who knows where the oil is, if there is any oil, is Pell. If Mr. Lopez allows me, maybe I can offer a solution. Shut up. Do you own this ranch? I was, but I'm not anymore. When I fell off the horse, I passed it on to my nephew. I'm just a poor guy. Pedro. Where's your nephew? It was the city. - Did the nephew go to town? - Yes, he did. But he’s nothing. And I take care of things around here. Hey, look here. I have a great idea, Mr. Thief. I mean, Mr. Lopez. The mortgage expires at eight pm. Stop these thieves here until eight and lend my nephew $ 10,000. And when we find oil, we'll give you half a million. Sir, I don't lend, I take. Mr. Lopez, I can see that you are an intelligent man. I'll give you $ 20,000 for this document. $ 20,000, huh? For something worth millions? Millions? We are talking like children. Nobody knows if there is oil here. I suppose you don't know here, huh? He's right about that. Nobody knows if there is oil. Understand. I will do business with businessmen. Right. What if I show you where there is oil? Will you show us? What did you say? There is oil here and you know where? - I've known for a long time. - Are you serious, Lopez? - Yes, it's on the ground. - Well, that's great. Now, the place is practically mine. The mortgage document is here. This Pell guy came from the east. We both grew up in the southwest. Yes, we work hard for the country's development. Why would we include someone from the city in the business? That sounds good to me, huh? What do you think of doing an auction? - Auction? - Yes. Whoever makes the highest bid keeps the document. And I'll show you where the oil is. Pedro will kill whoever makes the smallest move. - I'm in favor of that. - Yes, but he is rich and I am poor. Come on, shoot him. He is lying. Gentlemen. How much do you give for the document? I give $ 900. $ 15,000. - $ 20,000. - $ 30,000. - $ 32,000. - $ 40,000. - $ 45,000. - $ 50,000. - $ 51,000. - $ 60,000. - $ 65,000. - $ 70,000. - $ 75,000. - $ 100,000. - $ 101,000. - $ 125,000. - $ 130,000. - $ 150,000. - $ 160,000. - $ 200,000. - $ 200,000... - Sir. - Enough. - Will you sell me for $ 200,000? Do not. I won't sell. Do you think I'm interested in that role? And I don't accept a check. Do you think I will believe that you will leave here and return with $ 200,000? No, you will leave and return with 200,000 soldiers. - Why did you do the auction? - I wanted to find out how much I can charge for your ransom. - Rescue? - Do you really have that money? I will take you both to my headquarters in Chihuahua. - Aren't you even going to shoot one of them? - I would like to do you this favor, but... I'm not a fool. Rescue is more important to me. - Listen here... - Listen more and talk less. I have already decided that I will charge ransom for you. For you, too. And this one... Life has been very cruel to you. You've been married to this business man for a long time. I will take you to the land of the purple mountains. I will make you very happy. Okay, let's go. - Come on, Lucia. - Hey, you can't take Lucia. Why don't you take it? She is fatter. You've already said too much. Get out of the way. Come on, Lucia. Venustiano, get the best horse for my Lucia. - Yes, boss. - Lopez, don't move. Right. Put your hands up. Lucia, Pell, Hardy, get out of there, quickly. Gil, watch out! Help me. Arrest him. Sir, you are a fool. You will die fast doing such nonsense. Tie him to that tree. Hurry up. Put the prisoners on the horses. We've already wasted too much time. Let's go. Quickly. Take it and I will find you even if it takes the rest of my life, Lopez. Understand. You're in love with her, huh? This is bad. Men cause a lot of problems because of love. I will take care of you not to cause any more problems. On here. Hang it. Hey, you dirty mule. You cannot hang him. Shut up. Can't someone do something to help you? Morgan? I'm afraid we can't help anyone. Stop, old man. Wait. - I've seen your face before. - You are crazy. - I've never seen him before. - What is your name? - Jones, I own the ranch. - You are the owner... The beautiful lady lied, huh? Isn't it funny, sir? The redder the lips are, blacker are the lies. Hang it. This is none of your business. Just a moment. Just a moment. I've seen your face somewhere. Maybe I saw you when I took the cattle, huh? I would have liked to have seen him that day, in my sights. That's a shame. You would already be dead and I wouldn't have the trouble of hanging him from the tree. Maybe we met on a night when I was - too drunk to remember - No. Magnet, Chihuahua, Torio? - I've never been east of Sonora. - That's a shame. Too bad I had to die before I lived. Hang it. Pull it out. Hear me out. Release him. Get him down. Leave the. Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones? I think I remembered you. Been to Canyon Diablo? - What about it? - 5 or 6 years ago? - What if I was? - Remember a poor pawn who was injured and on the verge of death? Okay, I remember. And? Quickly. Where was he shot? In the rib. It's you. Do not you remember me? No, you are not that pawn. He was thin. Of course he was thin. That's why he was hungry. He was ugly too. Now I'm fat and handsome. Look at me. On here. Not the belly, the face. It's you. I saved Pancho Lopez's life. Oh, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones. My friend. My friend... - Pedro, come here. - Yes sir. Mr. Jones saved my life in Canyon Diablo. Venustiano, come here. You are very crazy. Would you hang the man who saved my life in Canyon Diablo? You imbecile. Hang up my friend. Lucky for you I recognized you. Venustian, apologize to the great Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones, forgive me. He is my friend. He saved my life. - Are you alright? - So far. Good my friend. Well, this is great. It's all right. - It is? - Yes. Yes, for you, she is fine. You are very well. He is fine. But for you two... No way. Well, friend, what about taking a shot of tequila? Tequila. What's the matter, Gringo? Don't like tequila? They put water. Hey, isn't it better to leave? The police are looking for you. No, the scouts watch everything for me. - Well, friend, how have you been? - I've been great. - It's been all right. - I think you're lying. - Things don't look good to you. - You're right. Business men have the mortgage and the bandits stole the cattle. At eight in the evening, you will be as poor as the pawn you saved in Canyon Diablo. You have changed a lot since the last time I saw you. Yes, when I got better, I saw that it was difficult to work. So I decided to enlist. You know, the soldier has a horse, gun, women. He has everything. One day, the lieutenant was killed and I took his place. The next day, it was the captain and I took his place. Then the major. So I killed the general myself. - Very well. - Well, not for you. I heard about these businessmen. They ruined you. - I discovered. - Yes, I'm in trouble. I am in the hands of that man, but I cannot do anything about it. This is bullshit. That's easy. - I'll take care of everything. - Like? Changing the laws around here. You live by their laws, now you will live for mine. In an hour, I will make your problems disappear. - You will be rich and happy, like me. - That's a lot - to be done in an hour, right? - It's not easy. But we need to do it my way. You can't interfere, huh? - Do you agree to do that? - It's all right. Thanks. In fact, if I can do that, I will place a statue of that belly in Chihuahua City. Right. I'll take care of that. - Hey, Pedro? - Yes? - Bring the prisoners inside. - Right. Quickly. But, Mr. Lopez, I don't mind going to Chihuahua. Seriously. Camping on the hills, bonfire under the moonlight, someone playing the guitar, it looks wonderful. Why do you make that expression and that noise all the time? What do you know about Mr. Jones' problems? She knows a lot. If he married her, as i said, there would be no problem. If he married her, he would have no problem. I couldn't help you like that. Of course, he doesn't love her. No, he loves her. The cowboy. Yes. - And she loves him. - Yes. - And he loves her. - Yes. Stop talking about others. But she is married to him. - Yes, the husband. - Yes, this is quite a mess. - Why don't you mind your own business? - This is my life. A man falls from the sky, armed and with an army, and want to solve everything for both of us? I will help him. - So, you love her, huh? - That's none of your business. It's true, I can see in her eyes that she really loves him. She is very beautiful and we would be very happy in Chihuahua. But, what is a woman among friends? - You can have it, sir. - How would he be with her? - Why, she's married. - It's all right. You don't have to be agitated. Something needs to happen to the husband. I hope that's what I'm thinking. - Pedro. - Yes? - Shoot the next one you interrupt. - Yes sir. I have to do many things to make my friend happy. Cowboy. That lady who ruined my dinner and irritated me in many ways. He said he loves you, huh? - Well, he's a big old man. - No, I am not. But he is not wrong. If she wasn't crazy about the boss and he didn’t need her father’s money, I would love you, yes. - You love him? - Not. - Oh, Angela. - You love him. - No, I don't. - I decided yes. This is foolish. How dare you decide who I love? Why do you love Mr. Jones and irritate me in many ways. Angie, do you really love the boss? No longer did he love those two other men. That Phoenix man - or the one in Chicago. - Shut up, Red Giddings. - So what if they were more beautiful than me? - And smarter. I’ve known you for 20 years and I don’t think I should having such a smart husband. - I won't hear another word. - Yes, you will, my beautiful dove. I will not insist that you marry the cowboy. But if you don't marry him, I'll insist that you marry Pedro. So you love him, huh? Yes I love. I finished them. Come on, take her outside. Let's go. Now, we'll solve the rest, huh? Madam, please. Do you love my good friend, Mr. Jones? Just a moment, Lopez. We cannot discuss this here. Your delicacy is a little late, isn't it, Jones? Shut up. I will do as you please, sir. If you really want to please me, why don't you get the boys together and go? Sir, please. In love, women have more courage than men. You will tell me how we can make Mr. Jones happy. - You love him? - Yes. - What's the matter, then? - She is married to him, that is the problem. How many times do I have to repeat it? - And we'll stay married. - Sir... Did you take the oath in the church to love, honor and obey him? - Yes. - And would you accept divorce? Yes. Then, after promising to love, honor and obey him to death, would you break your promise in front of a judge? Yes. So why not do it now and save the judge from work? Why is it a sin. And sin is against the law. Don't worry about the law, Uncle Henry. And did the husband keep his promises? I think not. Madam, I think your husband is not your friend. This is ridiculous. This whole thing is ridiculous. Yes, sir. I lost patience with you. You are finished. Pedro? Yes? - Take him to the kitchen. - Look here... - Take him to the kitchen. - You've caused enough trouble. Lopez, you want to do me a favor because I saved your life, don't you? - Yes. - These people are my friends - and I don't want anything to happen to them. - I'll decide who your friends are. - Venustian. - Yes, captain? Watch the prisoners and take the old man to the kitchen. Yes sir. Guys, Jose, come. Look here, Lopez. If what you want is money, - just tell me how much. - Shut up. It's not that I don't want the money, it's that I don't want you. If you talk about money, I want to. And I'm tired of waiting. Now, he has more $ 1,000 bills than Pedro has fleas. You talkative fool. Now, give me the money. - Pedro? - Yes. - Give it to me. - Pedro? - Yes? - Give him 10 notes like that. Come on, Pete. Pay me. For me? Thank you. - It's for the mortgage. - But this is stolen money. If I give you the mortgage, I'll be an accomplice to the crime. What do you care? In fact, you will be dead. - Shut up. - Give the money back to Pedro, please. - Do you want it back? - You got paid, didn't you? - Yes, I did, but... - You are a thief, but I am a bigger thief than you. I'm nothing like that. I am a business man. You are a "loan shark". Pedro. Give Uncle Henry the money. - For me? - Yes. This will make my friend, Mr. Jones, very happy. Now that it's paid off, it's all over. Get out of here. "You're not going to let him steal from me, are you?" - The money is yours, sir. I would feel safer if I shot him. Hurry up. Look here. There must be a way to resolve this. Well, make any reasonable offer. In the oil industry, I have always had a reputation for being a good negotiator. - You cost me a lot of money. - I? I didn't cost you a dime. Look, I know some oil properties in Mexico that have not yet been opened. The two of us together can get a million pesos. Weights? Weights. If I take you hostage, I'll get you a million dollars. But I'm not... How to say? - Sordid. - Won't you ask for ransom for me? - Not good... Now we're getting somewhere. What will you do? You are a bad man, Mr. Wall Street. I will kill you. - Will you kill me? - For sure. You are kidding. - Playing? - Of course. Dead, I would have no use for you. - Do I look like I'm kidding? - But it's not human talk this way about killing me in cold blood. I do not like you. No One Likes You. Alive you suck. Dead, you will make two people happy. - Two people I love. - Understand. You will kill me so that my wife will marry Jones. Yes sir. You got it. Good... If that's what you want, I'll divorce her. - You would divorce her, huh? - Good... Of course, if that's what you want. Do not see? If that's what you want, he can have it. I'll give it to him. Will give. I swear I will. - I'll look at you before I shoot. - What? I've seen men who wouldn't fight for their money and I've seen men who wouldn't fight for their lives, but I have never seen a man who would not fight for his wife. Do not wait. If you kill me, you will be hanged. If I'm caught, I'll be hanged anyway. But you cannot do that. Not without giving me a chance to save my life. - At least fight fairly. - Fairly? Yes, give me a gun. Pedro, did you hear? These gringos are crazy. You asked me for a gun. If I gave you, you would shoot me. I am neither crazy nor foolish. Lopez, for God's sake. I'd do anything. You can have it. She and all my money, but... - Do not shot. - I've never seen anyone so cowardly. I don't hunt rabbits or leave dead rats at my friends' houses. Pedro, take him to the canyon and kill him. - Right. - Pedro, don't do this. - They'll hang you. - Stop talking. Right. Take the. - Lopez. - I did it. What? I kept my promise to you. An hour ago you had no money, ranch or wife. Now the money has been paid, the ranch is yours and the woman is free to marry you. Tell me, my friend. I made you very happy in an hour, huh? - She's not free. - Pedro will take care of that. - Did I not keep my promise to you? - Will he kill Pell? Of course. Pedro never makes mistakes. Goodbye My friends. Bye. Gil, you have to stop him. He will kill you. Are you going to kill him? Hasn't he killed yet? Lopez is slipping. - Lopez, wait. - Boss? Boss? Boss? - Here comes the mounted police. - To the horses, quickly. - To the horses! - To the horses! Police? Lopez, you can't do that. You cannot kill Pell. What's the matter with you? Can't you please him? I will make you happy, like it or not. The woman is yours. Come on! Quickly! - Goodbye friends. - Thanks for the visit. Well, this is over. It's late. - Thank you for the mortgage, Jones. - Thanks me, huh? I would say yes, you old goat. Come on, get off my property before I start shooting. - Give him the mortgage, Uncle Henry. - Have you lost your mind? Please return this document to me before I start creating a problem. Give it to him. That was stolen. Stolen. I saw him getting paid. Yes, but it passed so quickly through my hands that I didn't even see it properly. - Let's go. - Go ahead. I do not believe. I've never seen so much madness in my life. This Lopez guy gives you the property and you give it to the vultures. Here it is. You mangy coyote, it's too bad he didn't take you too. - Give it back to me. - No way. Yes, give it to me. I'll buy it back. $ 10,000. I'm glad Pell is dead, or Gil would send me back too. - This belongs to Lucia. - Oh my God. No one has any sense. What's the use? - What's the use? - Come on, Angela. We have to register the mortgage. Remember, you have until eight. So get your stuff and go. Okay, I'll pay $ 200,000. You can cash out at the bank tomorrow. Does $ 200,000 mean nothing to you? Money comes and goes. I prefer to have fun. - Would you have fun killing me? - Yes, and it will be quick. As soon as we get to the next canyon. Damn it! The police. They're after Lopez. Do not. Not! Well, I think that's it. You look tired. Want coffee or something? I wish I could express how sorry I am. You understand, don't you? I will do my best to help. Thanks. There comes a time when a man is sad, as I am now, but I like to look on the bright side of things. Of course, Pell is gone, but so what? He must have left a beautiful inheritance, eh, Lucia? - You have no sense? - Damn it! I want to know where I'm going to sleep tonight. Well, we'll take Lucia to the hotel. Then we will start to get used sleeping in the trailer. Well, let's go. It's all right. As soon as you change the tire. - I'll go with you. - It's all right. Make silence. Ghost. Hey, I thought you were dead. - Unfortunately not. - Damn luck. Now it's all back to the beginning. - Keep that gun, Pell. - In due time, Jones. I am grateful for your happiness, my dear. This is a great way to receive a husband who thought he was dead. I'm glad you're safe, Morgan. See, Gil? Our wife is a good woman. That's why we like it so much. - Come here. - You better stay here. You better come here, Lucia. I'll take you to the city. We have something to resolve. No, I will not go with you, Morgan. Now or never. Do not come? Interesting. Seriously? What are your plans? - We didn't do any. - Except I won't let - you come back to bother her. - You won't stop me. Come here, alone. Get away from him. She will stay here. It's all right. Stay and get what you deserve. You wanted to be together. Hold it, Gilly. I'm going. Morgan, Gill, stop! Hold that hand, Gilly. Don't let go. Don't be such a gentleman. Really fight. Fight. That's right. - Hold it! - I am doing this. Defeat him. Defeat him. Throw something in his eyes. Let's go. Got it? How many times do I have to shoot you before I die? Now you will remain dead. Venustian. - Yes, boss? - Take him to the desert. - Keep the silk shirt for me. - Yes, boss. I'm glad I escaped the police and came to find Pell. He killed poor Pedro. I'm glad I came back. Now everything is solved... How to say? Permanently. Everyone is happy. I feel like a bird. Your husband is dead. He's finished. - The mortgage has been paid. - That's what you think. - Do you see it here? - Yes. Well, we're moving. Full of bags. Besides, I have nowhere to sleep tonight. - Why is all this? - That imbeciI. He returned the mortgage to Hardy. I should have put him in the asylum when he was 3 years old. It is not safe to have him around. - Is that true, sir? - Why discuss this, Lopez? We would never agree on what is right and wrong. I can't take you anymore, my friend. Mr. Hardy steals with the mortgage, me with the gun. What difference does? How many times do I have to fix this? Do you think I have nothing more to do? He's crazy. You are wasting time. I don't waste time. It's all right. I will pay the mortgage with the money that I received for the cattle that I stole from you. That's what you call honesty, huh? - Does that satisfy you? - Yes, it helps me. I can't complain about that. But it is too late. Hardy is in town and in 15 minutes, the ranch will be his. - We won't make it. - Stay at the ranch. - We can do it. - But I... Not you. We. - We understand each other. - You bet, I will show you. - Here, wait for me outside. - It's all right. I'll take care of it your way, but I'll do it in person. My beautiful lady. You are sad because I killed your husband, huh? I think I should be happy for what I did. You love each other. If you're going to be together for an hour, why not now? When you need comfort. I dont understand. Your way is difficult and full of nonsense. My way is quick and simple like that... Do not know. I always thought my way it was very good, but... Now, I'm not so sure, why do you have the love of the most beautiful lady in the world. Thank you for having me, my friends. I had one of the most peaceful days of my life. And always be happy. If you screw things up again, I'll come back and shoot you. Like this... If you're going to pay that old coyote, I want to be there to see your face. You will be there, yes. I cannot make the payment since I am wanted by the police. How do you think I'll get there? Flying? - Travel well on that, huh? - Good? I'm great at this thing. Well, we'll see. Let's go. And don't spare the horse. Faster! Faster! Hold on tight. Mr. Lopez, This one goes in your honor. Faster. Faster. Faster! Translation Editing and Synchronization by WesterKasa / GM NOV2020
