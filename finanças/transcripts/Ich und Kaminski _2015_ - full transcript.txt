Last night, Manuel Kaminski died. He rose to fame in New York in the 1960s. Kaminski, one of the great masters of classic modernity, is dead. We just received the news of the death of Manuel Kaminski. - Picasso's friend was 89 years old. - The art world mourns Manuel Kaminski. His "Reflections" ... Wielki Polak Manuel Kaminski denies zyje. When he went blind, he fell into oblivion. Był jednym z najbardziej znaczących malarzy XX wieku. The French-Polish painter Manuel Kaminski died yesterday under unclear circumstances. The world bows in front of an artist of which Picasso had said: "He's a liar which allows us to grasp the truth. " Kaminski was a little boy when he arrived in Paris leaving his native Poland. He met Matisse by through his mother. She was the model of Matisse, and the little one became his first pupil. I will not say more. Manuel tried to put himself to surrealism. He worked fast and didn't like oil painting, because it dries too slowly. I immediately saw in him an enormous talent. Breton became his mentor. Giacometti wanted to paint it, and Cocteau adored him. Manuel painted like obsessed, but his first exposure was a disaster. Only Picasso bought a painting. Can you imagine? Picasso considered Kaminski as the only modern painter who was not influenced by him. Matisse was skeptical, but was convinced by Picasso. I always told her: "Manuel, drive gently." But it was like telling a fish that he had to learn to walk. All these terrible accidents. At the end, we all knew that they weren't due to speed, but in his eyes. Manuel was fighting permanent against the inevitable: his progressive blindness. Your first time in New York? You are lucky to have met me. Through Claes Oldenburg, his collection "Reflections 3" became known almost by chance in a pop-art exhibition. If you believe to know you in art, so come take a look at the Leo Castelli gallery. What you see there is called pop art, and here are the artists. It's very serious work treated in a relaxed manner, even if someone doesn't seem to agree. Manuel was furious the title I gave to the exhibition: "Painted by a blind man." But ultimately, it's what made him famous. For my father it was a shock to be known in the world as a blind man. Manuel took New York assault like a tsunami. It has become essential. He influenced everyone. The photographers tore it off. A blind painter is in itself interesting, but Manuel was a sensation. It's very simple and yet so complicated. I go blind and that's what i paint. And off we go for the game "What is my job?" It's your turn to enter, Mr. Mystery Guest! Will we recognize you? - Are we talking about you in town? - Yes. Are you Kaminski, the blind painter? - Yes. - Wow. The few photos taken in New York have influenced various artists for years. For you to write his biography, Manuel Kaminski revealed you many things about his past. You see, Manuel is a great artist but also a very good friend. Critics adored him, collectors chased him. Everyone was jostling at his exhibitions. It was then that he withdrew in the Swiss Alps. Was Kaminski really blind? Read my book. We arrive in Basel in 20 minutes. Sorry ? We arrive in Basel in 20 minutes. Are you done yelling? You asked me to wake you up. Yes, but don't bother shouting. You're going to put that away for me, huh! Considering what we pay, we could at least clean up for us. That's it. Yourself ! Pretentious Péquenaud. Ah, it's beautiful, Deutsche Bahn. And let it fart higher than her ass as soon as it wears a uniform. "You're going to put that away for me, huh!" Pan! And here is the razor that shits! Hey ho. Please ! There is no more current in the outlet. There is current, otherwise the train would not advance. - No. - Yes. What is your impartial feeling on the decline of society? You smell bad and you lose your hair. Am i losing my hair? What an asshole! ME AND KAMINSKI CHAPTER 1 THE CONTRACT What do you think ? From my editor's point of view, Kaminski is a gold mine. He has no biography. He knew the greatest: He was a pupil of Matisse, Picasso's friend, Breton's muse. The first chapters are ready. You just have to finish the book. - Who will write it? - Me. - Sir ... Zollner. - Zöllner. I discovered something. Nobody knows, and those who are silent. Know what? Kaminski was not blind, at least when he got famous. It was intoxication. Chapter eight of my book. Do you have Kaminski's agreement? No problem. But that is not the question. What is it ? First he has to die. Let him die? We're all deadly, Mr. Megelbach. When he dies, everything will fall into place. The magazines will talk about it, collectors will outbid. investors will restock, museums will be on the lookout. The Center Pompidou and Guggenheim will do posthumous exhibitions. This biography will be overwhelmingly successful. It will be a tidal wave. STATION LIBRARY Golo Moser. When the culture sun goes to bed, even the dwarfs project gigantic shadows. Ah, Golo, Golo. Great romantic, you will be too late. You will already hold my book in your hands. A classic before I even left. And you will find that everything what you wrote was nothing. Nothing compared to my biography of Manuel Kaminski, the most emblematic artist of the 20th century. Chapter Eight. The pretenses of the world. Sun rays pierces the cloudy vault. It will be a beautiful day. The mist disperses and lets glimpse a superb landscape valleys and hills. It is a bustling country. Warm and humid meadows where evaporate ... You will surely wait for me in the dining car, but don't count on me. I have things to do. I take ever smaller trains at ever higher altitudes. It goes into deep gorges and rushes into dark tunnels, to lead me to the one, the only, the great Kaminski. It will inspire a phenomenal art book 500,000 copies printed. He'll make the headlines. We will ask the origin such a success: And it will be thanks to me. Sebastian Zöllner. Golo Moser's books will pass for indigestible diarrhea next. You will mount my suitcases. I need a thick blanket, a second cushion and lots of paper. How do we get to Kaminski? I expected. Mrs. Voegeli. I am not a tourist. I am his biographer. Hugo. Ah, I love the countryside. In the middle of nature, far from everything, among simple people. People who are still close to animals, who live without ask questions. You know who is Manuel Kaminski, anyway? No? Does that mean anything to you, Mrs. Voegeli? Behind the house, half an hour walk. The manor with the belfry. There is no road? Hello ? Can i go up? Hey ! Stop! Stop chatting, you! Well then ! Hello, my name is Sebastian Zöllner. Mhm. Oh, lovely. Mr. Kaminski? You know him ? Here. What are you doing here? We weren't expecting you only in two days. I was faster than expected. I hope it is not bothersome. You could have told me that there was a path. - Are you his daughter? - Miriam Kaminski. Wait there, please. Impeccable. Are you Zöllner? - Sebastian Zöllner. - And we were expecting you. We can start right away. I have already prepared everything. You must excuse me, you take me out of bed. I tried to fall asleep during two hours, I took a sleeping pill and I got up. I need a coffee. You don't have the right to coffee. A sleeping pill just before getting up? Are you my biographer? I am journalist in large newsrooms. I work on your journey and I have a few questions. If you want, we can start right away. You will mainly work with me. My father needs rest. More for a long time. - I don't need rest. - That's what I said. That's not what your doctor said. I will be grateful for your assistance but your father is my privileged interlocutor. - It is essential. - I cannot be ignored. I am a great admirer from your father. His paintings have changed my vision of things. Bullshit! We are grateful to you to do this job. There have been other proposals ... but your editor has you warmly recommended. I welcome it. Knut Megelbach is an old friend. - What's your name, already? - Sebastian Zöllner. But we have to agree of some things: We wish.. We want to know precisely what you plan to publish. In exchange for our collaboration. - Of course. - Perfect. You are asking me questions. I would inquire if necessary. Okay. Where do you live ? At the village ? Yes, in the village. But I don't mind sleeping here. Perfect. We'll see you the day after tomorrow. Zöllner. - How old are you ? - 31 years. - Why are you doing this? - What? Journalist in large editorial offices. What motivates you? It's interesting. We learn there many things. - I never wanted to do anything else. - Ah ... It happened all by itself. Before I was in advertising. Here. It's okay? I am inescapable. He has a lot of people around him. It feels like at his funeral. Oh, hi, my dear. Hello. My name is Robert McClure. - Nice to meet you - Me too Is he the great writer? It's him. His new book will be out soon. - What's his name ? - Fear of fraudsters. "Fear of fraudsters"? An excellent title. Send me a copy. I will make a criticism of it. Thank you so much. Well done! - Well done. - Grand. Anna is the expert on my diet. We see all the colors coming to your house. Limited controllers, remaining peasants, folk natives. The owner of my house for example, Ms. Voegeli. We have no idea to call ourselves that! "Mrs. Voegeli". Voegeli! - Ah! - All my excuses. Mr. Zöllner, I must beg you to ... Oh, yes sorry. It's all natural. Oh sorry. Dr. Voegeli, delighted. Robert spoke to me of your new novel. Well i would not call not that a novel ... Do you know Habakuk Wernicke? The painter from Cologne? The report on his death spectacular was mine. His wife didn't want to talk to anyone, but I insisted. You see ? I stayed. I told her I would write about her suicide whether she likes it or not. She threw her dishes in my face. Mrs. Wernicke! Ouch! See. Widows are the worst nightmare biographers. One more reason to be here, is that there is no widow on the horizon. Hm? I want to say... Let's go! Chanel? - Pleasure ? - Your perfume? What? No. You should come back as long as it is still day. - I'll figure it out. - The road is not lit. He is right. You should come back down. Very good. So. Thanks for the meal. Let's go. What a bunch of fayots. Flayers! Boot lick! All there to turn her around. The poor old man, I pity him! Fortunately for him, I'm here. Hop there. Here, she no longer makes a face. Sorry. What do you have to look at me for? Shit ! Ah! CHAPTER 2 REFLECTIONS Hello, it's Elke. Sebastian, answer, it's important! Second message, yesterday at 4:40 pm. Katusek of the Abendkurier. Dear Mr. Zöllner. - Your criticism of Golo Moser is late. - He's screwed up now. - Call us back. - I should complain to Deutsche Bahn. Third message, today at 5:11 pm. Hello. Sebastian, please. - Yes ? - We need to talk. Oh, Elke. How did you get this number? It doesn't matter. We need to talk. It's not the moment. I am very busy. - Now? - Of course. A second. This is a beautiful canvas. - Sebastian? - Yes ? I already wanted to join you yesterday. You knew I was doing yoga, and you took the opportunity to leave. I can't hear you. The line is bad. It's not a laptop. - The line is good. - Ah yes ? Elke? - A second. - Sebastian? - Are you still there? - Yes. - This is the apartment. - Can I call you back tomorrow? I'm coming back next week, we'll have time to talk. - No. - Huh? You won't come back. You don't live here anymore. You said you lived only temporarily here. - Elke, this is our apartment. - Did you need the money? What makes you say that ? - Have you ever paid the rent? - I repainted the bathroom. No, you had it done by an employee that I paid elsewhere. Sebastian? - Is that a settlement of accounts? - And why not? Besides ... I met someone. I know it's not easy. I didn't mean to tell you on the phone. I'm going to forget this conversation. You didn't call, I did not hear anything. Walter said if you come back he puts you outside himself. - Walter? - He's moving in on Sunday. It's not possible. - I do not believe. - You should. - I did your business. - What? - I'll take them to the Abendkurier. - No, not at the editorial office! - Where am I supposed to go? - I dunno. - In the hotel. With a friend. - At which friend? I can't believe it! I repeat myself too much. I can not believe that you are capable of it. So far neither have I. But ultimately yes. How's it going with Kaminski? We get on very well. Manuel likes me, I think. It is essential. The girl is annoying. She puts herself between us. I have to get rid of it. Good luck, Sebastian. You will need it. What does it mean ? Wait, Elke! It's unbelievable. Walter! She ended up finding someone who supports his monologues on Ayurveda and Japanese films. A boo that does yoga and eats tofu. But why should he be called Walter? And the second pillow is not even there! You have to touch the canvas, touch it. It's time to take important decisions. how is the sun light up the mountain? "Good luck. You will need it " Ah, Elke. You didn't deserve me. I'm sure you already regret, but I won't call you back. You have to have self-confidence. When you have confidence in yourself, everything becomes possible. Everything, if you believe it. No, Elke. I won't call you back. Because I'm writing a book. My book. "Why are you doing this, Zöllner?" Because I can do it, Mr. Kaminski. Because I can do it. You are my chance. Too bad you have to die. I love Manuel like my father. You can save this: "Like my father". Well. I know him since the late sixties. I am 18 years old. Dad was still running the gallery. He was proud to exhibit Kaminski. And does Kaminski was proud to be exhibited at your place? Go for it. - Mr. Zollner ... - Zöllner. I have known many artists, but only one genius. I hope he doesn't hit on me. Manuel is great. Sometimes I tell myself that David is the greatest, or Lucien or Tom. Sometimes I tell myself that I'm the tallest, But then I think back to Manuel and I realize that we are nothing next to him. - You know ? - Of course. I also say to myself often that I am the greatest. I was talking about the painting. "Death in pallid waters." I will never sell it. Unless we pass by your featherboard, I bet. You will excuse me. The next time make an appointment. Next week, I'm at Manuel's. He invited me. Oh my God. And how much does it cost, "Death in pallid waters"? I will buy it when I am rich. No matter the price. I'm joking. You are not done with me! - Did you know Kaminski? - Manuel. My God, it must go back 30 years. It goes back over 50 years. - Not that much. - Oh yes, you can calculate. And you write on him? Indeed, I follow her bio ... He always said that it would be overlooked for a long time, then suddenly famous and then forgotten again. Hop there! And also write we couldn't know ... What? that we can live as long. Oh no, these fans of atonal music. I asked Dominik who was that pretentious guy. - He replied: "Kaminski." - Like it's the new messiah. It was not the first time that we were playing our composition in this theater. Interesting. - And he had a sly smile. - What a installer! The kind that takes you high. - Before I have accomplished anything. - Puffy with pride. Mundus vult decipi. We were working at the time on our symphonic suite. The first took place in Donaueschingen. Pierre Boulez was conductor. - We were talking about Kaminski? - Yes, yes, yes, Kaminski. I understood well ? Do you pay the bill? Take whatever you want, Mr. Silva ... uh Dominik. Can I call you Dominik? How a little old can he eat that much? You have done a lot for Manuel? People like him always find people like me. He considered it a debt that the world had for him. - Did you pay her rent? It happened. And today you are ...? The times are changing. Where did you know him from? By Matisse. - And his paintings? - Not overwhelming. At first, he painted pretty bad stuff. Bloated surrealism. Crazy men. But that changed with Therese. Who was Therese? My god, she was everything. A wonderful woman. Exceptional. It was she who gave talent of Content Manual. Even if she never admits it. I did not know. In this case, you must resume all from the start. One day he came to a performance. He was accompanied by ... by ... Therese Lessing. An intelligent woman in truth. I don't know what she found for him. It was avant-garde in the best sense of the word. Antibourgeois! A sort of black mass. But he and she didn't stop laughing. Until we kick them out. Outside ! The atmosphere was already electric between these two. Or just not electric. You follow me ? After a year, it was over with her. If you want my opinion, he never got over it. If everyone has in his life a decisive catastrophe, then Therese was hers. "If everyone has in their life a decisive catastrophe, so Elke was hers. " Why did she leave him? Why ? What do I know, Mr. Zöllner? There are so many explanations! So many versions! The truth is generally more banal. We can make you listen something else. One more word on your damn compositions and I swing you the dictaphone in the mouth. After Therese's death, he got married. Since we hear no longer talk about him. Therese is dead? What exactly do you want with him? No idea what those old schnocks told you. Enjoy your meal ! At the time, Manuel succeeded to persuade everyone that he would become a great painter. He had to be given what he wanted. Only Therese resisted him. I lied to Manuel when i told him that Therese was dead. Is Therese alive? Mr. Zöllner, in truth we are not no longer there, the rest of us. Old age is an absurd thing. We are here but we are no longer there. Like ghosts. Are you Therese? But no ! When she left him, Manuel wanted to kill himself. Ah really ? Dominik had to tell him say she was dead so that he stops looking for her. Do you have a picture of her? Ask him, maybe she will send you one. Who do I have to ask ? But, to Therese. So is she still alive? But yes. In the north. On the coast. Do you have his address? I even have his phone number. This is how Manuel painted me. I was beautiful at the time painting. Today it's in the painting that I am beautiful. CHAPTER 3 THE MANOR Mr. Kaminski is not feeling well. You heard ? I prefer to speak directly to Ms. Kaminski. It's good to live here. Clean air. The mountain. The garden. And Miriam. You're not very young anymore, but what are you beautiful! And interested. It can be felt. Miriam Zöllner. It feels good. Or then Sebastian Kaminski? Manuel's days are numbered. We still have his mansion, his fortune and his paintings. I'll manage the inheritance. The manor will become a museum. In any case in part. The living room will be my office. I will finally have time to write a great book. A thick book, but not too thick. A painting of step-dad will cover. Or a more classic painting? Velázquez? Vermeer? Tintoretto? A title in red letters. With an embossing and a wire-bound binding. In limited edition. With my relationships, I will have good reviews. But first I will free yourself from your loneliness, Miriam. Mr. Zöllner? You don't have to come back until tomorrow. I just wanted to say hello. Hello. I'm leaving in an hour and come back tomorrow. - I wanted to talk to your father. - He does not feel well. Yes, yes. It's time for his nap. It's time for his nap. - Where are you going ? - At the inauguration of the Kaminski Foundation. It could be interesting for your book. - Surely yes. - Perfect. Okay, I'm going to go for a walk. Could I use your toilet first? Anna. Can I call you Anna? Sebastian. Call me Sebastian. Yesterday's meal was delicious. Can we talk ? If you have something to do, you can do it today. You can take your day ... - 200. - Huh? Who do you take me for? 200, and you never see me again not until noon tomorrow. That's a lot of money. - 250. - It's way too much. 300. - Okay, 200. - No, 350. Take it or leave it. I forgot my bag. Well come home. Why is the car is still there? She left by train. My sister called. She needs my help. If you want to go there, I can stay at his bedside. Thank you for your offer, Miriam, but I cannot accept. Hmmm. Ugh! Kaminski's world renown is based on the lie of his blindness. It was just a myth. Point. "When the legend goes beyond reality, so we publish the legend! " "Dear Claes, thank you for your help in New York. However, I must add that I find your work worthless. Forgive my frankness, but in our profession the colluding lies are the most serious sins. Manuel. " For Manuel, everything that can be imagined is real. Thank you dear friend. Pablo. Picasso? Matisse, Stravinsky ... Not know. Chaplin, Camus ... Not know. Therese Lessing. "Manuel, don't cry by reading these lines. You always cried easily, but this time it's my turn. It goes without saying that it is finished between us. " Elke, don't cry by reading these lines. You always cried easily but this time it's my turn. It goes without saying that it's over and our union is dying. But that doesn't mean ... "... that we don't climb each our way, by meeting other people, dreaming at night and accomplishing everything what a puppet can do. " Hold me for dead. Do not call me. Don't look for me. The most beautiful in our love was his fiery passion. Your Sebastian. An underground workshop. A little musty smell. No trace of therebentine. Dry pineaux, hard palettes. Mice eat color. We haven't painted here for a long time. Broken glass probably from an instrument like a magnifying glass. Wow. We recognize Kaminski's leg, even if the style has nothing to do with it. A self-portrait full of anguish and pain: He is terrified, abrupt, furious. Unsigned, not even on the back. Undated and not found in his directory. His latest works. It must be worth a fortune. If he signs them, they will be priceless. Kaminski therefore continued to paint. Much longer than we thought. Either he could see or so he painted his blindness. "The blind series." His blindness started to weigh him. It disgusted him. The taunts they endured ended up piercing the armor. He answered them with dark humor And finally... he resigned himself. Straight ahead in the axis. With right angles. Without converging line. CHAPTER 4 ME Who is here ? It's me, Sebastian Zöllner. Anna had to go to her sister's house and she asked me to replace her. No problem. What was that ? What are you talking about ? Didn't you hear? This said, said, said, said, said. I'm here, if you need anything. I do not need anything. Ah the big cow! - Sorry ? - The big cow. Besides, she can't cook. How much did you bribe her? I don't know what you mean. We can start ? If you blow my face again, I'm not talking to you anymore. - You were in the cellar? - In the basement ? - It can be felt. - What cellar? She knows very well that we cannot send it back, that gourd. Nobody wants to come and work here. - And the way she looked at Voegeli ... - Ah, did you notice? Everyone noticed it, right? Tell me about Matisse. He was a good master? Ah, this house in Nice. I thought I wanted to live like that too. Where are we ? Sorry ? Ha! But of course you were in the cellar. Should i come back later? Where can we start? Where is Voegeli? He should have been there for a long time. Dr. Voegeli. The appointment. - It won't be possible. - I'm his doctor. We are at work. He has to focus. - I go. - No. You must not interrupt it. All his memories come back to him. You understand, don't you? The doctor had to cancel his visit. Can we talk about Therese Lessing? - Can we talk about Therese? - You are crazy. She's alive. - Who is that ? - Therese. She is alive, north on the coast. I even have his address. Dominik Silva told you that she was dead, but he lied. Bullshit! I'm going to see her soon. I can ask her everything. Only tell me what happened at the time. What do you imagine? Don't you want to know the truth? I will be at her house next week. I can ask him. The drugs are by the bed. - Uh, yes, next to the bed. - Idiot. Put them in a suitcase. - Why ? - Because we're going to see her. - You are not serious. - And why not ? Well, you are ill. You were not mistaken? Were you not lied to? I know how to recognize a lie ... Ah. She lives and wants to talk to you. She told me so herself. It is curious to know it alive. Curious and unpleasant. You are famous. - That's what you wanted. - Um? Being famous means have people like me by your side. So what ? Are you sure of yourself? Such a trip is ... The car keys are next to the door. In ten minutes. Therese ... No. Zöllner? I arrive. CHAPTER 5 PICK UP You shift too late. - You see. My mother was Polish. I know. She gave you the passion for painting. She gave me brushes and color so that I can take care of myself. I was a little bit obsessive. In any case, I was not an easy child. My mother was a voice teacher. However, she had forbidden me to sing. When his students came, I was hiding in the wardrobe. With Matisse it was the same. He didn't want to see me anymore. My paintings did not please him. But I didn't want to leave. You know what it is when we persist? It allows you to accomplish many things. In my report on Habakuk Wernicke ... Matisse was imposing, he was absorbed in his thoughts. But I didn't care. A young artist is a weird person made half mad by ambition and greed. Frankly Professor Komenew, do you find that Kaminski is a great artist? Relatively. His "Reflections" were a good idea to start with. His technique was great, but ultimately quite sterile. Two years ago I made it the theme of my seminar. The students were enthusiastic. My students were puzzled. He didn't say anything to them. Because frankly, if he hadn't gone blind ... Do you have change for tolls? Conversation with the last representative of classical modernism. Who could have predicted a hit like that? Sebastian Zöllner, on a night road. Alone with the greatest painter of all time. One of the biggest. One of the great. And with his secret works. Me and Kaminski. - Is there coffee? - Hello. - It's doable. - Who are you ? Sebastian Zöllner. And where are we going? At Therese, your ... We... It was your idea. I just wanted to help. Shall we turn around? Can I have breakfast? - At the next service station ... - Breakfast ! - Zöllner, right? - That's it. Do you paint? I stopped when they rejected my application for university registration. Maybe it was a mistake. Surely not. I painted with shades of color like Yves Klein. Some people liked it - But it was childish ... - I suspect so. Breakfast. Two coffees and five croissants. The coffee is not too light. No one has ever complained of my coffee. Yes, I don't see how it concerns me My dear friend, prudence is the mother of safety. The Evil One hides in ease. - This is Karl Ludwig. - Call me Karl Ludwig. - He will accompany us for a while. - Yes. - Can I know where you're going? - No. - Of course. - Where are you going ? It's personal. - I understand you, but ... - It does not concern you. We do not take a hitchhiker. Give me one too. - You shouldn't smoke. - Indeed. Eh. If I may, you two you make an unlikely duo. You are neither a parent, neither teacher nor pupil, and you don't work together neither. And it reminds me of something. But not you. It's logic. Give me back the cigarettes. What a dizzy! Please excuse me. 120 km / h, 115 at least. Oops, you're going to tease. The French are merciless. You bastards! On a straight line! You will have to pay, Zöllner. Rest assured, a large part of life is just a huge mess. A mess and a game of dupes. We meet the Evil One and we don't recognize it. - I continue ? - No. Yes. You said you didn't not an easy life. It reminds me my first exhibition. A bitter failure! - And it marked you? - I got used to it. I knew my time would come. Ambition is like a childhood illness. We overcome it and we come out reinforced. - Some never overcome it. - Ha. And then you had Therese. I want to go home. - Excuse me. - No excuse. Take me home. Maybe we could talk about it calmly? You really don't see anything anymore? Shapes, colors sometimes. - Silhouettes, when I'm lucky. - You are not totally blind. The sense of sight is generally overestimated. Suddenly everything became blurred. You thought that it was the end of the world? And you know what ? It was the end of the world! Shall we turn around? We continue. What? But you said ... I have two days of beat so i have time. I could come with you. You, shut up! Take me to the bathroom. Karl Ludwig, you get off. Want to insult him? You insult me. He didn't do anything to you. A second. - Should I help you? - It would be even better. - Do you have some ... - I don't have any money on me. - There is a problem ? - No, no, sir. Zöllner? What's so funny? What is happening ? Zöllner, are you dead? - The police ? - No, damn it! Didn't you understand who it was? Call a taxi. We have to catch up. Bitch. Zöllner! What is it? Do not make as if you didn't know. You always know everything usually. - "Dear Sir" - The taxi is coming. - A franc for the phone. - It is shameful. Play it. Fire. "A large part of life is just a big mess. " "We meet the Evil One but we don't recognize it. " - I have to lie down. - Is that all you can think of? - We need a car. - I want to go to a hotel. No, but you realize what we lost? You realize what does that mean for me? For you ? I thought that it was my car. Yes, good. It is true. But there were all my notes in it. For example. My typewriter. My future, damn! Bah, you are young. It's one o'clock. - Not yet. - At a sharp hour I take my nap. It's been forty years and it's not going to change. It delays us. I can also do drive home. Okay. In the hotel. The best in the area, okay? The best hotel. Good. I'll take you to the best of the best. I would not have accepted another Go ahead, sir. - What a splendid view! - It's not for nothing that it's called the Bellevue Hotel. - Magnificent. Do you see the doorman in livery? - There are even two. When there are state visits, this is where they get off. Goodbye, gentlemen. A beautiful carpet! I love art deco. I wish you could see it. - Hello sir. - Hello. Two rooms, and newspapers, please. Name and address, please. Yes. And a second pillow in my room. - But... - No, no porter, thank you. We have no more luggage. Thank you. Incredible, an authentic Chagall. There are more originals from Marc Chagall than copies in circulation. Mind the step. There is a strange smell here. Are you sure this is a good hotel? But of course. A five star. What's the matter ? The old man. - What? - The old man! - You should go see him. - Why ? But... he has someone with him. You should kick her out. Otherwise we will take care of it. - You don't mean that ... - But if ! Precisely! His workshop was always very tidy. Except when journalists came. There he turned it upside down for the photos. That's what gave him that aura. That and his black eyes of ancient god. Pablo was the only megalomaniac who was right to be. Come here, Zöllner. This is Jana. And here is Manuel. Oh, Zöllner, you're very lucky to be young. It is not going well at all. The concierge noticed it. It was he who informed me. Tell him who I am. I'm joking. Well Jana, you're going to have to go. - Thank you. - Oh. I'm extremely grateful. Come with me, please. Do not worry, he has already paid. I want to know something, Jana. Jana? Can I call you Jana? What did he want with you, Jana? What are you doing ? - Well you saw, right? - Yes, but before? - You must have done more than that. - Of course not. Did you see how old he is? What is your problem ? - Can I see the drawing? - Why ? Wait. - Nobody ordered that. - But if. Even double portion. In fact we do not have room service. But he said he would pay extra. Come in ! It's not too early ! Enter with the meal. You have to cut me the meat. Not now, Zöllner! Thank you. Zöllner, it's nice. How is it progressing? Very good. Better than expected. It will be a sensation. - Is he already dead? - No, no. But I have tables. finally I had some. - I have new paintings. - Aha. Interesting. You see, Manuel is the only megalomaniac who is right to be. Who is it actually? - Only... - He's not part of your family, is he? - I had expenses. - What then? - Unforeseen expenses. - The line is bad. I'm sure it will be grand. Good luck! Give me the drawing. Please. - Hello, Miriam. - I want to talk to my father. - How are... - Right away! Immediately! You know my father has a fragile heart? You are a criminal. It's an abduction. Don't be ridiculous! An abduction ? - We're going on a trip together. - It's intolerable. She doesn't realize that she lives in a prison. It's unfortunate at his age to be embittered at this point. CHAPTER 6 SHOULDER Light must pass through many lenses so that we can faithfully represent us an image. But reality never looked like a photo. - Will you manage to finish everything? - Yes thanks. The truth ... thank you The truth is found in the air. That is to say in the colors and not in the drawing. And not at all in the vanishing lines. - Do you record that, Zöllner? - Each word. We have not yet talked about your marriage, Manuel. It is almost one o'clock. - I have to lie down. - I know well. - We're going to go straight to the apartment. - I want to take a hotel. So pay for it, you dirty stingy! We're going to go to my house. You will surely like it. I may be old, Sebastian, but I’m not tight-fisted. I have never been. - Can you see ? - Are you a fool? It's a matter of perspective. The light of knowledge must pass through several lenses. Give me a cigarette. You shouldn't smoke as much. The sooner I would be done with life, the better. You agree, right? I wanted to paint a series of self-portraits made by imagination. Nobody knows what did he look like. We all have a picture very distorted of ourselves. Usually we strive to pretend otherwise with a whole series of tricks. But when we do the opposite, that is to say when we paint the illusion that we have of ourselves as precisely as possible with great details ... You understand ? A portrait without being one. You imagine ? But it wouldn't work. You have tried at least. How do you know? An assumption. Yes, I have already tried it. But we have to recognize when we failed. - Miriam cremated them. - Are you sure ? I asked him to do it and I haven't been back to the workshop since. But it would be a shame. All these self-portraits. We should keep them preciously instead of destroying them. There is nothing to be sad about. This is what I want to tell you. Take the measure of your own talent. No one can come to your aid for this stuff. A good idea is not enough. Everyone has it. What matters is ... what kind of painter I want to become. To get out of mediocrity. How can we estimate this alone? What is your goal, Sebastian? In life. In your future are you working on? Well. I want to accomplish something. Something important, which will remain. I don't know. You may not know anything, it seems to me to be quite concrete, already no? You know the story Bodhidharma student? Whose? Bodhidharma was an Indian sage in China. A young peasant wanted to become his student but he refused. The boy followed him everywhere. Mute and submissive, for years. Let it rain, let it snow. In vain! One fine day, he had arrived at such a state of disarray that he bowed down before Bodhidharma and said to him: "Master, I have nothing." "Well, get rid of it!" And there he found inspiration. But if he has nothing, what can he get rid of? It takes time to arrive to make a good painting. I was not one of the very tall. I was neither Caravaggio nor Goya. But from time to time, I was not bad. It's already something. And all thanks to Bodhidharma. - I'll quote him. - No. You don't have to quote it, Zöllner. You should learn it. We learn in spurts. Come. I do not know if I understood well, but I have the impression that instead of traveling to my past, we went to yours. - I'm hungry. - Yes. Here. Ah. My medication. They're in the trunk of the car. And where is the car? "We meet the Evil One but we don't recognize it. " Oh yes okay. So go, go. - Do you need anything ? - No, leave me. I want to go eat in two hours. Golo Moser. Phew! No interest. - Do not hang up. - No. - I just want ... - No. "Alonzo Quilling, new paintings." The old ones were already crappy but there will be people. What is this restaurant? A little detour in a gallery. The paintings are interesting. And how interesting paintings might interest me? I took a sleeping pill an hour ago. I barely stand and you drag me into an exhibition? It just opened. My last exhibition was at the Guggenheim 35 years ago. - Have you gone mad? - Just a few minutes. Quilling succeeded. Now even the blind come to see him. Eugen. Sebastian Zöllner. - Do you remember me ? - Of course. - It's Manuel Kaminski. - No seriously ? - But yes. - Ah. Eugen Manz, ArTMag. - What brings you here? - I would like to know. - Hochgart, this is Manuel Kaminski. - Yeah, yeah, i know. I discovered some works It's absolutely great. We could publish the right sheets in ArTMag? August. Uh ... - It's Manuel Kaminski. - But he is dead. If I can't sit up very quickly, you will be right. I write his biography. That's why we're here. He and I. We both. I beg your pardon. It's because you are a legend, like Duchamp. Marcel was a installer. A pretentious fool. - I would like to interwiever you. - No. But Duchamp is someone important. The importance is not important. Painting is important. I wrote his obituary in the Abendkurier. I can still find her. Good that time has passed since then. Someone told me that you are Manuel Kaminski. Shall we do a portrait? Will you still be in town tomorrow? I hope not. I need a taxi. Even Golo will be interested. Moser? Golo Moser? - It is here ? - Of course. Forgive my question, but which of my paintings do you know? None, I bet. - At the time, I can't tell you. - What did I say. I want you to bring it tomorrow at the publishing house. - Around ten o'clock, okay? - I'm taking care of it. - You will remember the good leaves, huh? - Zöllner! I understood why you did that. I underestimated you. What are you talking about ? You wanted to show me that they forgot me. No one had seen one of my paintings. - It does not mean anything. - Say nothing ? You want to write a book about me. This detail does not worry you? Not at all. The book will be great. They are all curious. Manz will publish the correct sheets. You said it yourself: We are unknown, then famous then forgot. - Did I say that? - For sure. - Dominik Silva told me ... - I do not know him. - Dominik. - I never saw it. You claim that ... If I tell you! You believe me? Yes. Of course. Manuel says he does not know Silva. I believe him. I believe everything he says. I do not care. I do not care when the book comes out. I don't care. I want... I don't want him to die. It happens to me more and more often. I have restless dreams like last night. An unpleasant dream. I was in a small space, and I ran out of air. I thought it was a coffin. and then I realized that it was a wardrobe. Is that you, Zöllner? You came back ? Then I was on a boat and i wanted to paint but I had no paper. You imagine that I dream every night of painting? Have you introduced yourself? You were there too, Sebastian. I was not expecting this to see you again. Your trip went well ? It looks bad. Wait. You weren't allowed to come back. I was taken aback. You weren't there and ... Other people would be flattered if I brought Kaminski home. Well, you could have gone to one of them. Ah, Elke. Stopped ! It's me, your Sebastian. Manuel is waiting for you to bring him to his love of youth. - How do you know that ? - By him. - He never talks about it. - Maybe not with you. I had the impression that he was only talking about that. And I imagine you didn't notice it, but he is very moved. - What is this story ? - I just wanted to be alone with him. I need it to write my book. - Ah yes, your book. - They stole it from me. And the car too. I think I would have rewrite everything, anyway. I thought Manuel was pretending but he’s really blind. It is more difficult than expected. Each has a different version. Nothing sticks. - It has nothing to do with what is said about him. - Because he's old, Bastian. Should I cry? No no. No, don't start crying. You said I still had a chance. What did you mean by that? Ask him. It's incredible but he is the first person that I meet who appreciates you. - What makes you say that ? - He says he has no other friends. - Elke, it has to end like this. - Yes. But it's not a tragedy, it's not even sad. Sorry, I could have told you more gently but otherwise I could not have get rid of you. It's your last word ? I already said it on the phone. I want the apartment be empty within an hour. Elke. Otherwise I call the police. - What about Walter? - Yes, and Walter. It must already be worth a used car. A new one, if he signs it. Shall we start? He has to sign it. Well done ! You can do it too. Close your eyes. Imagine something. Something simple. Something simple? Shit, no idea. It's easy to say. It's less easy to think. Something simple. Bread? You have something ? I do what I can, shit. Easy. Pouf. Simple. Nothing comes to mind. It's not possible. A balloon? A duck? Are we going to take the train again? No, not today. Today we're taking Elke's BMW. CHAPTER 7 TO GOAL Manual. Eh. Ouhou. I have to go somewhere! I was afraid you were dead. I must admit something to you. You saw the self-portraits. There is not just that. I took two ... And they left with the car. I'll give it to you if I still had them. Have I been here before? Surely not. I believed at the time that I was going to die. It would have been better. Nothing else made sense. Continue. Act like there was still a reason to hang on, as if I was not already dead. Therese has always been smarter. The apartment was empty. You have never lived something similar. Why do you believe that I have not already experienced this? We believe we have a life. And all of a sudden, everything scampers off. Art means nothing. It is an illusion. And we are aware of it but we continue. Let's go. We're looking for Therese Lessing. - Doesn't she live here? - She's warned of our arrival. Uh, it's not exactly true. We talked on the phone, but I don't remember if we fixed ... - Take me back to the car. - You are not serious. Take me back to the car. But go home. - Are you Therese's friends? - Therefore, to say. My name is Holm. Therese and I are ... Well we live together the twilight of our life. Therese is inside. Come. Thank you. Watch your step. One more. Always straight. Therese, guess who's there. Sorry, what was your name? - This is Manuel Kaminski. - He's an old acquaintance. Do you remember ? Therese has trouble hearing. An old acquaintance, Kaminski. - Do you remember ? - Yes of course. From Bruno's society. Kaminski. My God. You? Yes. And I'm Sebastian Zöllner. I called you. We agreed ... - Do you like cakes? - Huh? Waiting for coffee. - Sit down then. - How nice. I heard that you became famous. You predicted it. Predict what? Oh my God. Sit down. It has been such a long time. Therese never told me. She has experienced things. That can be said, right? No need to blush. Twice married. Four children, seven grandchildren. It's something, right? Effectively. You make me nervous to stand. It is not comfortable. You don't look good, Miguel. - Manual. - Ah, yes, yes. Manual. Just a couple of questions. I would like to know... No. They are neighborhood children. They call by masking their voice and they think we don't realize it. But they chose their target incorrectly. Here... Hold. So... What happened when you left? Part ? - Part. - You disappeared. That's Therese. I took a train and I went north. I worked as a secretary. I found myself very alone. And then I met Yves. We got married two months later. So, did you forget the coffee or what? Hop there. We had two children. Henri and Maria. But you know them. How could I have known them? Yves had a car accident. With a drunk man. He died instantly. He did not suffer. - It is important. - Mhm. - The most important. - Yes. When I found out, I thought that I was also going to die. She says it like that, but she is valiant. Two years later I got married to Bruno. I had Eva and Lore with him. Lore lives ready, on a parallel street. You take the third on the left and again on the left. - And there you are. - Or ? Chez Lore. This is where you wanted to go. No. What is your job exactly? - He is an artist. - Oh. He is known. You shouldn't only read the sports pages of the newspaper. He was very gifted. It was a long time ago. This mirror. So scary! The first time you did something that... What bothers me are these images where nothing can be distinguished. You don't do that, do you? I had a small factory of herbalism You are sure that you don't want coffee? ... for tea, shower gel, the cream against aches. I always thought of you. After all this time. - I was wondering... - Yes ? Nothing. You're right, after all this time ... What ? But say it! Do you remember your letter? What do you have in your eyes? You are an artist, It's not difficult ? Do you remember your letter? How then ? I was so young. - And so ? - I didn't know anything. You knew more than that. That's what I always tell her. When I ask Therese ... Shut up. No, Manuel. I really don't remember. You do not know the best stories. It was at Therese's 75th birthday. The whole family was there. And when they started singing "For she's a jolly good fellow", just then in front of the big cake ... 75 candles. There weren't so many. There was not enough room. Do you know what she said? - But there were 75. - We have to go. Do you know what she said? Why did you never come? Dominik said you were dead. Dominik? You said you didn't know him ... Did he say that? Why ? I was young. We were so unpredictable. I was someone different. That is true. And you were older then and you had so much strength. Oh, such energy. I was dizzy when I was with you for a long time. To be young is to be drunk. A continual intoxication. The fever of reason. No, no, Manuel. Not for me. In truth, it was after it all started for me. So what did you say on your birthday? If I only knew. She didn't want to go back. She said she was waiting. Now what about coffee? It's late. But you've just arrived. We could watch TV together. There is "Who wants to make millions?". He's a good presenter. Oh, I read that he is getting married soon. Do you come often to the region? You should come back. Is not it ? I will introduce you Lore and his sons Alain and Paul. They live in the parallel street. You take the third on the left and then left again. Very good. What kind of artist are you then? Happy travels, Miguel. - Have a nice trip. - Drive safely. Sorry, Manuel. Hey! - Why didn't you come back? - He said you were going to leave. I didn't want to do dragging things out. And you, give me the keys to the car. I spoke to the owner. If you make it difficult, she will file a complaint against you for theft. - It was not theft. - Really ? Our car was found on a highway rest area with a very polite letter inside. Come. Come on, Manuel. - I did not do anything wrong. - Of course not. He's a poor man that his daughter kidnapped, right? Nobody had told him that his childhood love was alive. and you wanted to make yourself useful. - Exactly. How do you believe that I know this address? I visited it ten years ago. She gave me her letter. I tore it up. Why ? We knew well someone like you would come. She led a life in which he no longer had his place. He had to respect his decision. He's an old man who no longer manipulates anyone. Oh no ? Did he tell you about the contract? What contract? I think his name is Moser. Golo Moser? That's it. Golo Moser. A series of articles in a magazine on Matisse and post-war Paris. Memories of Picasso, Cocteau, Giacometti. Manuel talked for hours with him. Maybe we could have told you all this earlier. Sorry. But you still have his late work. You will not have searched the house for nothing. He has no late work. Then it will be a very small book. What has happened to you ? You look different. Can I say goodbye to him? Have you spoken to Golo Moser? Is he called that? A nice man, very educated. Is it important ? I wanted to say goodbye to you. You do not come with us? I do not believe. It will surprise you but I like you. I have never seen the sea before. Impossible. It couldn't have been done when I was little. Then it didn't interest me anymore. Now she refuses to take me there. It's his way of punishing me. - Why ? - For everything. Are you sure ? It's my daughter. Is the key on contact? Mhm. - Asshole! - Don't stop. Shit ! Why didn't you have me Nothing said about Golo Moser? It was only Paris. Everything else is for you. - It's enough. - No. It's not sufficient. You know how many times I imagined this meeting? "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ?" "Eva and Lore. You take the third on the left, still left and you're there. " And this playful hare on sunset background. Ah yes, the hare. But as you know that, do you? - What ? - You understood me very well. - How do you know what was on this table? - Ah, Sebastian. CHAPTER 8 IN DARK WATERS Barely believable. I would have died without coming here. You are not ready to die. Bullshit! I have to go back to get my suitcase. Did you leave something there which you need ? I have nothing. So get rid of it. The key. Tell her that I'm sorry. For the first or second removal? Both. What are you going to do now? - I don't know. - Very good. Give me my paintings, please. "For Sebastian." Good luck, Sebastian. You too. And to all earthlings! Me and Kaminski. Based on the eponymous novel by Daniel Kehlmann.
