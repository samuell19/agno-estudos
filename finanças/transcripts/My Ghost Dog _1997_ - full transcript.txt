[music playing] -Hello I'm Toby, I'm your next door neighbor. -Hi. Oh, that goes in the Asian room. Yes. Oh, I like your magic ring. -Oh thanks. Well, welcome to the neighborhood. -Thank you. -Oh boy, it's here. -All right, found it! -Is that it? -I think so. Ah, locked. -We'll never find the key. -I suppose not. Hey, I got an idea. All right, bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, fastball down the middle. Yes. Once more, once more. All right. Yes. Here we go. Home run. Why is Aunt Violet making such a big stink about me living with you? -Eh, I don't know. In the two years since your mom has died aunt Violet has run out of people to pester. It's just our turn. -It seems weird. -Yeah, try to be nice. She means well, all right? Wait a second, wait a second. Yes. -Mom's will? -You betcha. All right. My son Tobias shall remain withhis stepfather, Chet Emerson, in the eventuality of-- case closed. -Yeah! I'm starved, can I get pizza? -I'm going to make lunch. -Dad please no, don't cook, please. -All right, all right, allright, I get the point. Here. Be back by 12:30? -Gotcha. -Miss you. -What do you think? I sure hope this settles it. I don't want to leave dad. Aunt Violet does have a cool house. Remember all those Christmaspresents last year? [barking] That was cool. Come on, let's go get some pizza. Hi Aunt Violet. -Hello darling. I happened to be in the area soI thought I'd drop by and see how my favorite nephew is fairing. -Dad and I found the-- how's Gramps? -Hanging on. Are you getting enough to eat? -Yeah, Lucky and I werejust going to grab a slice. -Oh, here's a littlesomething to help you out. -Cool. -The custody hearing is coming up you know. -Yeah. -Who knows, maybe you can come and live with me. [barking] Of course we'd have to get to you a new haircut and some clothes from Zebo's. Anyway, run along, go have your pizza. And be thinking of the hundreds of gifts you'll be receiving for Christmas. -Oh boy. -Come give your aunt Violet a kiss. Tuesday, complained of no food in the house, had to give him money to subsist. Bartholomew, it's not fair. I'm the rightful heir. It's inconceivable that mynephew is the last Stanton man and stands to inherit myfather's enormous fortune. But not if I can help it. -You don't want to live with aunt Violet, do you boy? [barking] You and me both. -Hey punk. Get over here. -What? -Get over here. Don't go walking around this neighborhood talking to your dog. It's going to make theneighborhood look whacked, which is eventually going to make us look whack. Yeah, you don't want that do you? -Are these things defective? -You're defective. -Hey. -You know what, now you did it. [barking] You know, that flea picnic of your ain't going to be around here forever. -Yeah he is. Adios loser. [barking] -Hey Vito. -Hey Tony. Enjoy, my friend. Oh, is lucky. Here we go. This is especially for you. -Thanks Vito. -Ah, I take care of my friend. Hey and say hello to your pop for me. -Hey. -Give me the money. I know you got it in there. I know you got it. Give me the money. -Let me go. -Give it up, give it up. -Let me go! -Excuse me boys. -Who's that? -I don't know, but she looks loaded. Come on. -12:30, encountered twoslacker hoodlums in the park. Look dumb enough for the job. Are you two interested in making some money? -Money? I remember the stuff. -Shut up. Doing what? -Slightly dangerous, and itinvolves brains and brawn, and you have to keepyour mouth shut about it. -Well that's no problem. I'm the brains and the brawn. And, well he's my associate. -I resent that. -Do you know who Toby Emerson? -What that little dweeb that talks to his dog? -I want you to confiscate something from his house for me. -No problem, we love break-ins. -No break-in. Just walk in. Don't you want to know whatit is I want you to steal? -A big screen TV? -No. A small grey file box. A hundred now, a hundred later. And don't screw it up. -Smile honey, smile. Come on, there, good. That's it, nice. -Oh come on, honey, that's enough. Give me the camera. Give me, give me the, give me the camera. -Those were the days, huh. -Mom, we love you. We love you. -It's not healthy watching that tape over and over. -Hi dad. -Let's not wear out that tape, OK? -I know. I'm just thinking about mom. -Hey, uh, we got to come upwith a new show at the station. Got any ideas? -Yeah. The Toby and Lucky Magic Hour. -Not bad, but we got to appeal to the late night crowd. Oh, late night. Speaking of which, I got to go out tonight. Jill's going to come by. -I thought we were going tothe fake wrestling match? -Sorry pal. I got to interview one on the prospective hosts for the new show. -I understand. -Hi it's Chet Emerson, is Jill there please? Hello? Um, you can have it. It hasn't worked in years but-- I just, I just couldn't bearto let this go to the dump. I mean this, is LeBeau lamp. He's a very famous designer. I'm an interior designer myself. -Jill. Sorry. -It's OK. -Cheerleading practice? OK, thanks. Baby sitters, they're reallyhard to come by these days. Hi, Chet, I manage the local cable station. -I'm Phoebe. I believe I met your son, Toby? -Oh, yeah, yeah. -Yeah. -You're the new neighbor? -Yes I am. Yes. I think Herman and I will it here very much. -Herman, I haven't seen him around. -Well that's because he stays in mostly. You know, I'll babysit foryou, since you're in a bind. -Really? Are you sure it's not too much of a problem? -Yeah. No, I mean no. I meant no, it's not a problem at all. Toby seems really sweet. -Oh, great, um, could youcome over, at say, uh, six? -Sure. Oh. -Emergency at the station. You're a lifesaver. Thanks. -Yeah. I'm-- -Um. [barking] -Now sir, I will bet you a dog biscuit that I'll pick the card that you chose. [barking] -That isn't it, is it? [barking] -Give me a break, I just got this trick. If only I could read Chinese. Let me try that again. -Hey Tobes. -Yeah dad. -You know Phoebe, our new neighbor? -Yeah, she's cool. -She is and she's going to be watching you tonight. I've got to go. There's an emergency at the station. You know Sam's outside. Why don't you go out and shoot hoops? Um, yeah. Here's some pizza dough. Love you buddy. And love you too. [barking] -Love you. [barking] [doorbell] -Uh, I'm coming. Oh, hi Chet. -Hi Phoebe, I have to leave a little early. Is that OK? -Sure. -And Herman won't mind? -No, I don't think it'll ruffle his feathers any. -Uh, Toby and Sam areshooting hoops out front. What? -It's, uh, a little crooked. There. -Thanks. -Welcome. -See the new neighbor? -Yeah, she's watching me tonight. -Toby, I'll be over in a little while. -OK. She's cuter than Jill. -Don't you think she's a little old for you? -Yeah but not for my dad. -Now you're thinking. -The ten of clubs? -Whoa! Pretty good, huh Luck? [barking] -Nothing to it. -You have to show me. -OK. After somebody's picked a card, you very gently bend the bottom corner of it. And look for the bent card and you've got it. -Phoebe you're the bomb! [barking] [doorbell] -Pizza, Pizza! I'll get the drinks. -Hey small fry. $10.35. -You didn't spit on it, did you? -Thought you liked it with everything on it. Short a buck. -Hey! Nice try pizza jerk. -Go in there and get a tip from your father. -That was almost funny, ha ha. He's isn't here. -Really? You don't say. [barking] -Later. -See ya, wouldn't want to be ya. Loser. I've heard such wonderful things about you Chet. Professionally of course. -I'm fatter. I mean, flattered that you asked me to dinner to pitch your idea. -Well my brother said you neededa late night show, pronto. -Lane's your brother. Well, I'll have to remind myself to thank him for setting up this little meeting. He also said you're a dancer ? Modern ballet? -Oh, no. Wanda would have nothingto do with formal dancing. Wanda's too much of a free spirit who has to explode across thestage in a fireball of passion. I call the show, Wanda's Dance Fusion Hour. I talk about my life indance, have guest appearances, and perhaps, do a newdance routine every night. -Where is it that you dance? -At the Chunky Chicken off the 215. -So my friend, is this a blind date? Or have you just gone blind? -Business. Just business. -Oh, thank God. -Can you hurry up with somemore of that free bread, senor? -Oh, certainly. Just let me go and call the bakery. -Goodnight sleepy head. -Will you show me how to walk the aces? -Sure. We can do it tomorrow. Oh my gosh, I forgot to feed Herman. Oh well, he's probably asleep by now anyway. -Who's Herman? -He lives with me. -Oh really. -He thinks he's the love of my life. Good night, sweet dreams. -Toby come in. Over Toby. -What's she like? -Pretty cool. But she's living with some guy named Herman. -Bummer. I've never seen him. -He probably works thenight shifts or something. Toby out. -Sam out. And Toby? -Yeah? -Cheer up. -She would've beenperfect for dad, perfect. -Even if my idea doesn't work out, I hope we can remain close friends. It was a very special evening. -I, uh, I never thought you would really dance on our table. -Never double dare Wanda. Would you like to come in fora deluxe private performance? -No thanks, I'm still digesting. You know the breakdown of enzymes is a very important metabolic process. -I'm a night creature Chet. -Wanda I'm sorry, I don't thinkthis is going to work out. -Fine. You know, I don't need a show. My two shifts at theChicken satisfies that need. Besides, you're a dork. -My middle name. -Hands up jail birds. Get away from the bomb, now. Stephon, you there? -Come on. Quiet. Shh. Go, go, go, go. -All right. -What was that boy? Lucky come back! [barking] [screaming] -Hey! Toby! -Phoebe! Come on, call 911! -Get out of here, get out of here. -Come on Lucky! Get 'em boy! Get 'em Lucky! Sic 'em boy! Don't let 'em get away. Come on, get 'em Get 'em! -Open the door! -I'm trying! -Let's get 'em boy. -Toby! Toby! Don't you-- -Go, go, man! Faster, faster, he's gaining on me. [squealing tires] [dog yelping] -Lucky? -Run! Run! Come on! -Come on boy, get up. You're OK. Come, on buddy. [whine] We're going to take you to the doctor. Maybe they'll put a cast on you. Won't that be funny? [police siren] -Son, can you give me a description of what they look like? Are you the mother? -No I'm just babysitting. -Please don't die. Hang on a little longer? [crying] -Oh, Toby. I'm sorry. -Toby. Hey, come on son. It's going to be OK. -I was just driving, andthese, these kids ran out in front of me, and Ididn't, I didn't see the dog and I just hit him, hit him. -So all they got was a small grey file box? -Yes. -Well, considering what they didn't get it, could've been worse. -Isn't that evidence? -Oh, yeah. -Look officer, his mother's will is in that box. I've got a custody hearingin a couple of days. Without the will, his aunt may get temporary or permanent custody. -Well the door doesn't look jimmied. Was it locked? -Yes. I believe so. I'm not exactly sure if I locked the door. -Well I've looked over the whole house, and unless they had a key,I don't know they got in. -Oh, what a rush. -Yeah but you had to make so much noise. We could've had all the stuff. The camcorder, the TV. I can't believe you. And that dog ripped my favorite jeans. -We got another hundred coming. That's all that counts. -Come on we've better bury that box. -Hello Chet. -Hello Violet. -How's Toby? I heard about what happened last night. -I think he's pretty upset. -Are you raising that boy or torturing him? -Your sarcasm is not appreciated. -You know this isn't going to look well at the custody hearing. What did that bandit's make off with? -Oh, in addition to the-- actually, it's none of your business. -Really? -Really. -Well I only stopped by to comfort the boy. I suppose I can come back another time. -Toby are there? It's breakfast time. Come in Toby, are you awake? Come on Toby, pick up. I know you're there. Are you home? -Yeah. I don't ever want to get out of bed. -I know. I'm sorry about Lucky. -I lost my best friend, except for you. Now I think I'm going to lose my dad too. -What? -My mother's will was in that stolen box. My dad needs it to keep custody of me. -Oh boy. We've better get pizza and talk. -Here you go, he he. Toby, I, I hear about last night. I'm so sorry. Poor, poor Lucky. I have my mother say a novena. That's a little, uh, prayer. Anyway, the uh, the pepperoni pizza is on the house. -Thanks Vito. I hope the cops find that box. -Well, what wouldsomeone do with this box? -I don't know. -Sell it? -Nah. It's just an old tin box witha bunch of legal papers in in. -Looks like we've got to find out who broke in. Is something else bugging you? -It's dad. He needs to meet someone. Since mom died he hasn't doneanything except take care of me and Lucky. -Excuse me, but uh, I like you dad, but uh, I think he could use a lot of help in the female department,if you know what I mean. -I know. But if he found someoneit'd be a lot more likely he'd be able to keep me. -Hmm. You know, I think I got an idea. -Ma'am, I can't wait sixmonths for a copy of the will, without it I'm a sitting duck. I'm a widowed, working stepfather, and she's a blood relative. And she's rich. I don't care if the attorney's in Grease, it's a two hour play, hecan get it to me tonight. Oh, the country. Thanks. -This really work? -Sure it will work. I mean this is how myuncle Mike met his Betty. Oh, cute girl. Hello, yes, I'd like to place an ad. And I would like it toread, "Single father of one 12-year-old, seeks lady for fun, romance, and walks on the beach." Oh yes, and she must be liketo bake chocolate chip cookies. Tomorrow's edition? Good. Alright just put it on my monthly paper bill. Thank you. -And God bless daddy, and mommy, wherever she is. And Sam. And God bless Phoebe next door. I wish we could find the will. I want to stay with dad. And I wish he could find someone special. He's lost his best friend too. Lucky, I hope you're up therehaving a wonderful time. I miss you buddy. -John. -I'm Terry. And this is "Pasta Talk." Today we're going to talkabout our two favorite pastas. One, penne, and two, rotelle. -Dear Mr. Emerson, my lizard Spanky and I-- -Oh no, that's not what rotelle is. -What are you talking about?-Rotelle isn't long and twisty. Rotelle is round. -No they're little,spiral, the spiral things. -No, no, that a bow tie or that's a twist. -OK you're-- rotelle is round! Get him off of me. -Though I'm writing from jail-- -Oh my gosh. Dad. Lucky? This can't be happening. You got to tell me what's going on boy, because you're scaring the heck out me. -Uh, I really don't know either. -You talk. I must be dreaming. -Hmm, this is the welcome I get? Hey, who's your best buddy? Look at me, I'm back. Well, not completely back. -You're a ghost dog, cool. -Hmm, I guess I am. -Did it hurt when the car hit you? -You know it's funny, I didn't feel a thing. But I sure was glad you werethere to help me crossover. -How come you're back? -I've been sent back to help you. -Hey, you can help me find the file box. -You said it Sparky, it's payback time. Oops, sorry. -It's OK. Some magic trick, huh? -Yeah. I'm glad you're here Lucky. -Poor kid. Maybe he would be better off with someone else. Toby! Breakfast. -Good morning dad, we're here. -Morning. Eggs? -Dad. -You like eggs. -Look. -You want your eggs on the floor? -Lucky's back. -He's what? -He's a ghost dog. I know it seems weird, but Lucky's going to help us find the will. -Sure, why not. You know, uh, we could use all the help we can get. -I'm not visible to everyone Toby. -Really? -Remember, I was sent here to help you. -Hey, uh, Tobe. Why don't we keep Lucky our little secret, OK? -You could really see Lucky? -Yeah. Hi Lucky. -Go, go, go, go, go. -OK. OK. I'm with you. -Point to him. -Hey, ha, there he is. Oh, good Lucky. Kisses, kisses. Oh, Lucky, your breath is bad. -Brother, I don't think so. -Dad, I was just kidding. -Son, it's OK to miss Lucky. -Let's go back to the scene of the accident. We might find something. -Now that using your head. -Hey look! -Hey, I bit that out of thepants of one of the burglars. -Our first clue! -Oh boy, we're on the right track now. -Now we just have to find thepants that this came from. Let's get at it. -Toby? -Look what I found? -Are you all right? -I'm better than all right. I got a major clue andLucky's back-- I mean, oops. -You were talking to Lucky? -You definitely don't see Lucky right there? -Definitely not. -Good, because he's not there. -No, but you think he's there. -I'm just so used to himbeing there that I forgot. -Are you sick or something? -I'll catch up to you later, OK? -Sure. Whatever. -Yep, this is the spot. Hmm, I don't see any clues. -They took off into the woods over there. Come on. -Oh, boy, this is great! -Lucky, slow down. -Ah, come on, it's beenawhile since I've done this. Woo hoo hoo! Hee hee. -They might have dropped it. Keep your eyes peeled. -Why would they go into the woods? -I don't know. -Hey, look! That must be the burglars hideout. -Ha, my dog house is nicer than that. You think they were here? -I'd say so. Maybe there's a hidden compartment somewhere. Can't you see through walls and stuff? -Ha, what am I, Superman? -Crooks always have a hiding place. -Hmm, I wonder where theyhid their vacuum cleaner. -Maybe not. -Hey check it out. -What is it? -Their stash hold. I think they found the file box. Bogus. -At least we know the crooks are local. And by the looks of this place, it seems like they come around here quite a bit. -Let's tell officer Nelson. -No, no. If we attract a lot of attention the crooks probably won't come back. -Yeah. We should keep an eye on thisplace and see who shows up. Come on I have to work onmy plans to stay with dad. -Hi, my name is Greta and I read your ad. I'm am in my 30's also. My friends tell me I'm attractive and I love little boys andchocolate chip cookies. Call me at 555-7801. -Should I call? -I don't think this is the wayyour dad wants to meet women. -Probably not, but I got to do something. Hi, Greta, this is Chet. -Oh boy, I can't watch this. -Yes, you read my ad? Yes, I'm free tonight. Hold please. How is dad going to meet herwithout knowing what we're up? -You didn't think this out too well, did you? -Would you like to meet my sonand maybe have a little dinner? Seven. OK. We live at 2564 Terrace Court. Goodbye. -How are you going to pull this one off? -I'll think of something. Dad, I'm really sorry, you're going to kill me. I forgot tonight was parent, teacher night. -You in trouble? -Pretty deep. -Don't give me any lip, mutt. -I bet you pardon son? -Hip, my teacher's really hip. You'll like her. It's just a standard meeting. -Boy, this kid can think on his feet. -OK, what time do I have to be at school? -Actually, they're starting a new thing where the parent and the teacher go to a restaurant or something. Get dressed up. It's like a date practically. -Date? Did you bring home a note? -Lost it. -Fast again. -I'm going to call school,something doesn't sound right. -It's four o'clock, they're closed. And that means you only havethree hours to get ready. -OK. -There we go. She's really cute, and she's single by the way. Don't feel like you have to talk about me at all. -What an adorable little boy. I bet you like chocolate chip cookies, ja? -Ja. -Oh, shall we go, it's 7:05. -Sure, let's uh, hit the road. -I'm doomed. [laughing] -Two gold medals. -I was East Germany's greatest female hammer thrower. -It's hard to believe. -Not really. -So how's Toby doing at school? -You're asking me? -Yes. -Toby? Fine I suppose. You are keeping up for him to do his homework, ja? -Ja! Having any trouble at school? -What? -With your kids? Sometimes they can be unruly. -I wouldn't know. I'm childless. -You're what? -But it doesn't have to be that way. -Hey Vito, how's the date going? -She ordered raw meat for dinner, how do you think it's going? Kid, why did you make a move without me? Your dad, he don't look too happy. -I love touching-- ah, teaching. Despite the bruises. -Really? -A few scratches unavoidable. One time, I had a student in a hammerlock. She flipped me, and accidentally scratched me underneath my drazen flippsen. -Jeez. But, Toby's doing well? -Oh, your son? -Yeah. Loves chocolate chip cookies, about yea high. -He's not enrolled. -That little turkey. -He can't, it's impossible. -But I help him with his homework? -Mr. Emerson, I am a womanself-defense instructor. -Would you like somethingstiff from the bar, sir? -Personal ads? For crying out loud Toby, Ican handle my own love life. -Told you dude. -Let's see here. Must love 12-year-old boys andbaking chocolate chip cookies? -You like chocolate chip cookies too. -Yes I do. But that's not the point. You lied and embarrassed me,and that weird Nazi woman. Now I don't know what the appropriate punishment's going to be. -But dad. -Don't make him angrier. You might get off light. -Don't make me angrier. Now go to your room. -Relax, he'll cool off and see the whole thing with a sense of humor. Let's talk about our next move. Uh oh, mayday. I don't like the looks of this. -Over here, there's definitelyno decoration whatsoever. There's a lint ball in the corner. It needs a woman's touch. -What's going on? -Can't be good. -Hi aunt Violet . -Toby! Darling. -Isn't dad here? -Well, he left this note onthe door, had to go to work, something about going toPhoebe's, whoever she is. -That's OK, he's been really busy. It's cool though. I have a key to get in. -Do you often stay home alone? -Just for about an hour afterschool until my dad gets home. -The truth darling. -It Is. Who are you. -I'm Peter Abelino. I'm your guardian ad litem,I've been appointed by the court to write a report that will recommend who should retain custody of you Toby. When's the last time you had a hot meal? -Uh, jeez, let me see. -Don't answer that. Hey, the cavalry's coming. -It was this morning, oatmeal. Good for the colon. Hi, Phoebe. I'll be taking care of Toby today. You ready for a healthy, nutritious lunch? I'll just take that. And thank you, goodbye. His next hot meal's getting cold. -Excuse me, Miss. -Nice to have met you. -Looks like the boy's well watched, ma'am. -I've never seen her before in my life. -She lives next door. Convenient. Saw the boy as soon as he walked up, good. -Would you stop with that. The father's not fit for custody, I'm the blood relative. He's only the step-father. -That will be taken into consideration in the court ma'am. -You read the policereport, they were robbed. Who knows what thatdeadbeat dad is involved in. -I'll put it all in my report Ms. -Mr. Abelino, or may I say, Peter. I hope you'll be fair andimpartial in your findings. And I would most certainlymake it worth your while if you would keep asympathetic eye open for me. -Why, a, of course, Violet. -As soon as I saw that cardrive up with exempt plates, I knew they was trouble. -Don't need it anymore chief. Besides I wouldn't be able to taste it anyway. -Oh yeah, I forgot. -Forgot what? -Uh, nothing. What was that guy doing with Aunt Violet. -Was probably checking up on your dad. -She means well. She's just getting batty in her old age. -I'm not so sure. Hey, I got something for you. Hold on a second, let me find it. Yeah, there we go. This is the Whitman Book of Magic. My dad gave it to me when I was a kid, and I want you to have it. -Really? Excellent! -Go ahead, it's yours. -Thanks Phoebe. I better run, I got a lot of work to do. Come on Lucky. -What did you just call me? -I feel lucky to have you as my friend. -That's, that's sweet Toby. -We got to speed up the investigation. We're running out of time. -You said it. I hate those guys in suits. -Would you look at that? Kid's warped. -What's a guardian ad litem? -I think it's a cross betweena lawyer and a baby sister. -Hey twinkle toes, come here. -Not again. -I thought we had conversation. -What, I'm busy. -I thought you didn't wantthe hood to get a bad rep. -I don't. I live here too you know. -Then why you walking aroundhere talking to your dead dog. -If you're going to talk to something dead, at least talk to Abraham Lincoln. -Ha, ha, this guy's really funny. -Aren't you two late for apolice lineup or something? -You know what, I hope youhave all day, because we're about to make your life miserable. -Hey Tobe, look at his pants. Look, look! -You two broke into my house. I can prove it. Lucky tore this off the burglar pants. -I ripped that on my bike chain. -I want the file box back. -You know, why don't you go pull a rabbit out of a hat or something. -I got an idea. Let's remind them I'm still here. You get my drift? -I'm putting a curse of Lucky on you. -Ooh that's scary Peewee. -Until I get the file boxback, the curse of Lucky will remain on both of you. A demonstration. -Whoa. -An ordinary baseball. Go play. -And away we go. -Go Lucky, go. -Woo hoo! Yeah. -Watch out, I'm coming through. -Yeah. -How does he? What is it? -How did? -Look out, here comes. Hello. -What is that? -Wee! Coming at you pal. -Hey what's going on? -Here we go, up, up, up, up, up, up. Wee! -What's that? -It's a baseball, it's coming at us, run! -Here I come. Watch out kids, I'm swinging right by. -Mommy. -What's going on? -Oh, boy, it's going to be great, here we go. The knuckle ball for the knucklehead. -Think gentlemen. That was just a demo. I want the file box back in two days or else. -I think they got the message. Way to go ghost dog. I've been waiting to see that for years. -Yeah me too. Ever since I was little and Larry put a laxative in my puppy chow. -There you go. Herman. -That's Herman? -Hey Toby. He sure is. He's my brother's. I'm taking care of him while he's on vacation. -Herman's a bird? -He's an African Grey. -That's fantastic! -You like African Greys? -African, Australian, Italian! I love them all! See you Phoebe. -OK. -I don't care if Herman is a cockatoo, I'm not going to ask Phoebe out. -Why not dad. She's cool. -Well, I'm sure she's busy with her business. -She said she liked you dad. -She did? -She did? -Yeah. -Well I'm busy with the psychic healer show. And besides remember thelast time you fixed me up? -Come on Dad. You can't stay busy forever. -I'm busy Toby. -Sure dad. -Shh. SAM [VOICEOVER]: Dearest Chester. TOBY [VOICEOVER]: Hiya, Phoebe. SAM [VOICEOVER]: It would be the fulfillment of my innermost desire-- TOBY [VOICEOVER]: You want to grab some lunch with me this afternoon?

Come on, in the car. -Mess. -Come on. -Hey, check it out. -Thank you. -Um. -Looks like things worked out. -I don't know. Dad said the custodyhearing should be a cinch. But it'd be a lot better if we had my mom's will. -Things will work out. -Hope so. Well, thanks for your help. -See you tomorrow. -What a wild day. -I think she likes you, Romeo. -Nah, come on. -I really do. I think there's a greatfuture here with you two. Come on she lives right down the street. -All right, knock it off. -Tobe, come on, we'll be late for the court date. -I'm coming, I'm coming. -Hey pal, you OK? Don't be nervous. Even without the will, we got a real strong case. Violet, all she has is thefact that she's your aunt. That's it. Come on. Let's take a look at you. You look good. -Chet, I wanted to catch you before you went all the way downtown. It turns out, I had best willand testament all this time. I thought you had it. How inconvenient, so sorry. Hello Tobias, darling. -What about the hearing? -Mr. Emerson, with thediscovery of your wife's will, the court feels thatperhaps you should secure legal representationbefore the custody hearing. I've come here today to offer the chance to do just that bypostponing the court date. -Who are you? -I'm Peter Abelino, Toby's guardian ad litem appointed by Judge Sayers. You were notified by mail. -Uh, yeah. -My evaluation of the child'scurrent living conditions will be reviewed by judge Sayers and considered as a recommendation as towhat's best for the boy. -I have the will. I mean I did have it. It was stolen. -Yeah, I saw it. -Well, why don't we all save a lot of time and consider the matter settled. Beth's will is very clearabout her last wishes. What do you think Peter? -Under the circumstances, I say that's an option, that is if Mr. Emerson agrees. -This can't be right. -What dad? -It says that your mom wantedyou to live with aunt Violet. -Isn't that wonderful darling? -It's a forgery. -Oh Chet, don't be so dramatic. -I don't know what to tell you Mr. Emerson. This will give Ms. Stump thelegal right to take the child. Now if you plan on contesting the will, the boy will be placed in afoster home until such time as a hearing can bescheduled in civil court. -Foster home? -Go fetch your things Tobias, darling. -Dad? -You miserable, meddling-- -Don't raise your voice to a lady. -Uh oh. The lady. -I told you I had the will. It was stolen. And come to think of it-- -Lady, the lady. Harry said he gave it to the lady. -you're involvement ofthis whole stinking thing. -Well, until you find your mysterious will, I'm entitled to legal custody of Toby. -I want to talk to my lawyer. -Under the circumstances, I'd say that's a good thing to do sir. -Here you are darling. -Of course, she has it. -We got to get it back. -Don't bother flea bag. She doesn't have it. She told those ruffians to bury it in the woods, where nobody would find it. Ha! [barking] -What is it? -That little dirt-bag says it'sburied somewhere in the woods. -The hiding place in the floor. -We already checked. The file box was kept in the garage, right? -Yeah. -I'll be right back. I've got some sniffing to do. -Come here Tobias. -Where is it, where is it, where is it? It's here, it's here, it's here. Come on, come on. -Europe will be in just a few hours. Pack light. -I don't want to go. -I know, change isn't easy. But you can write postcardsto all of your little friends and they'll be so jealous. We'll have to hire a tutor of course. -I'd like to go toEurope, but not with you. -Just for that crack, we're going to spend an extra day at the louvre. -I got the scent, I got the scent, oh boy have I got the scent. -No please, don't put me on hold. No, no. -Oh nix, nix, Chet. Our plane leaves in two hours. -I want to see my dad. -Give me five minutes, please. -You're going to have to let go son. -No. -Hang in there Toby, I'll save you. -Hurry Lucky. Hurry. -Nose don't fail me now. -You're not leaving here with my son. -Sir this is only going tobe used against you in court. -Don't touch me! -Now look, either you let her leave with the child or you file a motion to contestthe authenticity of the will. Now you think about what you're doing. -I know exactly what I'm doing. A son should be with his father, period. -Step-father. Your father's histrionicswill aid us greatly in court. -Aunt Violet, you suck. -Hold it right there! -What? -Don't you run over me, you witch. -Phoebe. -He's not going anywhere. He's staying right here where he belongs. -You tell her Phoebs. -Why don't you do something? -I am sorry sir, but I am going to have to call the policeunless you let her leave. -Call them. I'd like to tell them that you're letting a woman with a phony legaldocument take off with my son. -Hey, what's going on? Toby? -Dispatch, send a black andwhite to 2564 Terrace Court. -Where is it? Where is it? Oh, I know it's around here somewhere. Come on. Come on. -Mr. Emerson, what seems to be the problem? -She's trying to take Toby. -Officer, this is the mother'slast will and testament which states that she wants hersister here to have custody. -Let's take a look. -I think I got it. I think I got it. Jackpot. -Everything seems to be in order Mr. Emerson. I'm going to have ask you tostep away from the vehicle. -Over my dead body. -Mine too. -I'm not moving. -Make that three dead bodies. -You're scratching my car. -Ma'am would you step away from the car? -Not on your life, copper. -I don't want to have to use these. -This is it, this is it, oh boy, this is it. -I don't want it to get ugly. -It already is ugly. -Hang in there dad. -Oh, tasty, but totally bad timing. OK, let's try over here. Got it! Come on, come on, come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry. I'm close, I'm close. I'm feeling metal. -Don't let go. -Come on dad. -Dig, dig, dig, dig. Bingo. Hope I'm not too late. -Mr. Emerson. -Look. -Do you see what I see? -The file box! -I can't believe it. -Closer. -Oh, good heavens. -Closer. Closer. -What is that? -The canine has landed Houston. -That's it! That's the stolen file box. -Made if just in time. -Like Jordan with a three-pointer. Hurry, take it over there. -Toby, I can't give away any of my trade secrets. -Here. -Hold on ma'am. -This is the will. The real will. Let's see, right here. My wife said, Toby issupposed to stay with me. -Officer this is obviously a last ditch attempt to gain custody by hook or by crook. -May I have a look at that? -This is an excellent forgery. -It appears that a miscarriage of justice has been narrowly averted. I apologize Mr. Emerson. I don't think the state needs topursue this matter any further. -Cool! -Oh, you moron! You promised! -I promised to be fair andimpartial Violet -- Ms. Stump. -Well just my luck I find the one government official who cares about justice. This isn't over. -Oh this may be over. Are you Violet Stanton Stump? -Yes, of course. -I just came from the homeof Larry and Harry Duzimsky. And they told me that you paid them to break into the Emerson's house andsteal one grey tin file box. -Nonsense. -I knew it. -Put your hands behind yourback, you're under arrest. -Oh, Impossible. -I don't think so. -Violet, how could you do this? -My father left all hismoney to the little dolt. It should've been mine. Mine! You're just a kid. What are going to spend it on? Candy? Toys? Huh? Ah, my hair! -Well, I'll be heading off too folks. I'm sorry for any inconvenience, but I think things turned outjust the way they meant to. -We won! -Yes. We sure did son. We sure did. -So what do you think, should we take callers? -Yes. I want to help people with theirspecific decorating problems. -Ha, ha, ha. Martha Stewart, move over. -Phoebe, congratulations onyour new late night show. -Thank you sweetie. -What? -Go on, get ready. And hurry up, we're going to La Casona for dinner. -Can't wait to tell Vito what happened. What a wild day. -Toby. -Yeah Luck? -I'm not going to La Casona tonight. -Why not? It's time for me to go back. My work is done. No, you're not leaving twice. This isn't fair. -I know. But there's nothing we can do about it. So long pal. -Not yet. Before you go, do you think I can hold you just one last time? -I think that might be possible. Just once. Don't be sad Toby. Remember, even if you can't see me, I'll always be with you, forever. -I'll miss you pal. -Goodbye Toby. Thanks for being my best friend. You're the coolest. -Bye Lucky, you're the coolest. -OK, I'm ready. Dad? -Surprise! -Sam, you look great. -Thanks. -Dad what's going on? -And guess what I found? -What is it? -Open it. -Come on. -OK. Wow, cool! Thanks dad! -Look at his collar son. -Luckier. That's a great name. LUCKY [VOICEOVER]: Remember,even if you can't see me, I'll always be with you, forever. [music playing]
