Ballad of Mt. Nara Why did you go to Arayashiki? Tatsuheii. Nothing special. How is that elder doing? Not too bad not too good. Ryu, bring over the firewood. Granny, how old are you? Sixty-nine. Granny, you have strong teeth, you can even crack the pine cone and hard beans. I never ate those kind of food. Granny, you have 33 teeth. Idiot, I only have 28. Granny, you counted till 28 but you are supposed to have more! Asakichi, shut up and go back to work. Carrying the salt merchant Otori at the back, up to the mountain we go on a snowy day... Hurry, hurry, hurry. That Stinky is still sleeping. Risuke, Risuke. Harumatsu is hungry. You went to Arayashiki yesterday, didn't you? I heard one of the man from the village sneaking to the village to look for the she-dog. I didn't go. They treats that dog as their own daughter. The ex-husband even beat a man to death. I didn't go. You are my brother. If you do something shameful, I will lose face. Stink to death, go over there and stop breathing. Jinsaku, dad. What's up? Why are you boiling the congee? Granny is dying. Granny Gogane...? Mom, mom, the congee is ready. Okin It's too much to abandon a dead child on our field. Dead child? Your wife was pregnant not long ago, right? No, it is not us. I arranged a grave and buried my in-law's dead child. When? Ten days ago, I did it personally. Risuke, that dead child... may be it's from Nakaya. They also had a pregnant woman at home. Is that so? Risuke. It's your family's turn to make a coffin. My mom can't make it, thanks for helping. Otsune. You abandoned the dead child on my field, right? Right! You stink so much so if I throw it on your filed, it will deteriorate faster. That's why I specially brought it here. You should thank me! I don't need those fertiliser! Is this your brother? I am not the one who gave birth. I thought it was a woman but it was a stinky man. Idiot, you were supposed to be dead child. Wasn't you too? Who aren't in this village? Stink to death! If it's a boy again I'll throw it to the stinky field again! I don't want this kind of fertiliser. salt merchant? Long time no see granny Osuzu! It's only been a year and you have a cute grand-daughter. But the child's mother, Tatsuhei's wife Otake is... I heard about it. She was so unlucky. Not long after the child was born last year while picking chestnuts, she fell from the cliff. Come up and have some hot soup. Is Tatsuhei out in the mountain working? No, he is in the field. But on my way here, I think I saw him at the west mountain. You saw Tatsuya? Too far away. I couldn't see clearly. May be I recognised the wrong person. By the way, granny Osuzu, I am here not for the other reason. Isn't this salt? We didn't decide yet to sell her or not. I'm not here for business. Komehachi of the front village asked me to bring this to you. The front village? She asked me to negotiate with you about being Tatsuhei's second wife. Freezing! Freezing! It?s freezing! Woman from the front village is coming to marry you! Her name is Tamayan She just became a widow and said after 100 days, she'll come and marry you. She is 8 years younger than you, 37 now. So old? Not pretty at all! Stinky! Stop come near me! Stinks like hell! Risuke. If he doesn't want you to come near, don't! If Asakichi inherits this family from Tatsuhei, he will be the head of the family. Tatsuhei. Did you go to the west mountain this morning? No. salt merchant said he saw you. You look more and more like Rihe. You mean to say he saw my father? It?s not possible to be alive, disappeared for 30 years. Must have recognised the wrong person. Let's move. Stop crying. Mom. You really don't know why dad disappeared? You were 15 and Risuke 5 then. It was bad harvest that year too. We sold new-born daughter to the salt merchant. Plus, your dad's mom, she was 69, just like my age now, age considered to be not suitable for working. Because of continuous hardship, and with Rihe's weak mind, he refused to let his mom go up to the mountain. But the rule is the rule. We cannot just depend on the emotions. It?s not only him who was sad but he ran away. It made village people laugh at me. You are not thinking... I am different, I am not like my dad. Yes, you are right. My mom sitting at the corner of a warehouse counting, found she had 33 hair below. Matsuyan, how many do you have down there? How do I know! I help you count them! No, Asakichi. Stop it. Stop it... Don't want to do it here. Stop it, stop it. Oh, my bracken... Don't mind that. A bit later, I?ll help you pick more bracken than these. And acutiloba bloom... Little bloom... and angelica buds... I?ll pick a lot for you! A lot! It hurts. It hurts. Granny Osuzu sitting at the corner of a warehouse, Granny monster counting her 33 teeth. You come over to my place, come and count how many teeth my mom has! Tatsuhei, I don't mean to insult her. I am just copying what Asakichi was singing. Asakichi? Yes. Whoever it is, help me! My son is a monster! He doesn't feed me. He wants to starve me to death. Who is there outside? Dad! He is Tatsuya from Neko family. Is it? My dad wanted to kill a chicken to eat last night. Last time, one died just like this. I want him to go up the mountain this winter. He is already 70 years old. Your mom is about that age too, right? Neko family's Granny monster sitting at the corner of a warehouse counting her teeth realising she had 33 Asakichi, your granny's teeth are monster's? Your granny loved you so much, how can you do this... bastard! No food for you! I really envy you, Osuzu. Why? I cannot make it anymore. Too healthy like me is also something to be ashamed of. Eating food is also not less than other people. I want to go up the mountain. If not dead by illness, I want to go up to the mountain and die there. Isn?t it the same? Our souls will all go up to the mountain. We all will meet on the mountain. Do you think we can? Yes, your husband is waiting for you there. I don't know about my husband. I wonder where Rihe disappeared to. He just left the gun at the west mountain. He was dead. He liked gambling and women. He wasn't bit lack of decency but he wasn't a bad man. You can say that. That means, you still like him a lot. I don't know. You also had a hard time. Having hard time was nothing. Losing face in the village was something. Granny Gogane is dying. When? Looking at her, may be she can't pass tomorrow. After two months, bride is coming from the front village. Then mom can be relaxed a bit. Wait a moment. That woman doesn't have to come here. I want to get married, she doesn't have to come. My wife can take care of Yuki. Don't let her come. What are you talking about? Adding two mouths at one time our family cannot afford it. You idiot! No food for you! He wants to marry Matsuyan from Ameya family. You idiot! Keep your mouth shut! Is it too big? It is okay. Even dead cats body swells up too. This coffin looks good. How is Granny Gogane? Just dead. Oh, we must hurry then. Mom, you are not dead yet? Not yet! After having some congee, I am okay. Good girl, good girl. Oh, it is congee cake! Granny monster! Idiot! Good girl, good girl. This autumn's harvest is not good either. The stem pith grew too much. Are you here to attend the memorial service? Is this Tatsuya's place? You are Tamayan from the front village? My home also have memorial service, but they told me to come here and attend. They said I eat better here. So I came walking the whole night. Oh, you must be very hungry then. Good girl, good girl, good girl. Good girl, good girl. Come on in. You shouldn't have stayed outside and came into the house earlier. I was bit shy to do so. My brother wanted to bring me here, but he got drunk after the memorial service. Salt merchant said you are a good person, told me to go as soon as possible. I should have gone there to pick you up. I am so happy to be here. I can take care of the child. Did the salt merchant tell you about me? I?ll go up to the mountain real soon. You don't have to hurry! No, better be quick with it. The god of the mountain will praise me. These fishes are the one I caught. You can catch fish? Nobody catches more than I do in this village because I know where the fishes are. I will teach you. okay, finish off all these. I still have a lot of dried fish. I will go and call Tatsuhei over. Don't mind it, eat them all! What? Only two? Risuke, don't tell anyone! What did you pick up? Nothing special. Give it to me. I said it's nothing. Give it to me. Stop bothering. You Stinky! Very smelly, smelly, smelly! What kind of leek are you? I am your uncle, behave yourself! Shit! Eat slowly. I will go and get Tatsuhei now. Okay. In my age, it's time to go up to the mountain. My teeth are not strong anymore. Okay, pull it up! Hurray. Neko family's Tatsuhei is very lucky. October 10, he will have the second wife. Lucky, lucky. Asakichi, where is Tatsuhei? Don't let go. Jinsaku, Jinsaku. Granny monster, Granny monster. If bitten by her, you can never run away. Neko family's granny Osuzu sitting at... Will be eaten by the Granny monster. Monster has 33 pieces of teeth. Tamayan, Tamayan is getting married to Tatsuya. Tamayan is substituting Osuzu. Even she doesn't look pretty but still a good daughter-in-law. Good daughter-in-law. Takeyan, Takeyan, after the memorial service, go back to the mountain and have a rest. Don't keep the anger in your heart. You are doing better than the last one. You too! The god of the House is moving. The god of the House? I came to say hello. Good girl, good girl, good girl. Come over here. Shiro, don't move! Shiro, don't move! Stay still! Kohe. Kohe. Kohe. Kohe, you listen carefully. Honey, I grilled the snake already. This house is cursed. Inuya had a warehouse. That man made the woman living in the warehouse pregnant. So the elder in the house killed the man. I am sick, I cannot die up in the Mt. Nara. All cursed by the man who was killed by the elder. After I am dead, you have to treat all the men in the village as your one-night bridegroom. Everyone? Yes. Then you have to worship the god of the House and let those men worship the god too. If it is not done this way, this house will be cursed by that man forever. Kohe, you listen carefully. I beg you, you have to make atonement. I beg you. I understood. Keep it up, I understood. Please. I will make atonement on behalf of you. You are lying! I am not! Who did you hear from? It was Arayashiki family's elder's last word last night. Who did he tell this to? Of course, to Kohe! How did you know? This... I was passing by and heard them. You Stinky, you went to play Shiro, right? Idiot! I won't never do those things! Stinky is mad, because he stinks so much even Shiro doesn't want him, he is gone mad! Gone mad, gone mad. You are gone mad! Insane! Bollworms! Everyone is laughing at me. The god of the Mountain, please cure my smell and then... um... Let Kohe's husband die soon. And then... You idiot! You tried to keep it from me! I heard what happened last night. You mean you heard I peeped you making love? You peeped? Oh, you mean mom's teeth? Teeth? Mom told me not to tell anyone. I am talking about Shiro at Arayashiki. You idiot! What did you say about mom's teeth? Tatsuhei. You know You can't run away from this by rolling on the ground. Come, come with me. You idiot, I will teach you a lesson. How can you try to keep things from me! Idiot! I won't never do those things! Mom. I love my mom the most. The stone-like front tooth. Bastard! Bastard! Idiot! Idiot... Idiot... Your brother is just like your dad, beats up people when angry! You've been beaten up before? People who has no guts beat people up. Am I smelly? No. Big brother also never said I was smelly. It seems like the cart moving. Did you see? It came off! Baby is getting big. When will you give birth? Next year. After the baby is born, I am the father, you are the mother! My mom will say that this baby is a "rat-baby". Why is that "rat-baby" is not good? You are not supposed to have baby too young. Granny Osuzu will hate me, just like the Granny monster in the story. We can't do anything about it. You come to have dinner tomorrow at my place. Really? We have to put more rice on our bowl first! I think so too! Matsuyan, you are good in those things but cooking, you need to practice more. I am sorry to let you have so much hard time. Not at all, Neko family has a lot of these. No No, no! No more next time! Why did you let her go? Is it a right thing to do? It?s a headache to have one more child but I feel that he is my own reincarnation! I don't hate him as much as people think I do. Time to sleep. Have to offer an apology to the god of Mt. Nara. Have to offer an apology to the god of Mt. Nara. Where is Tatsuhei? Where is Asakichi? Everyone's gone. Gone where? To Ameya. That's your house! You stay here. Take care of Yuki. I heard something while I was sleeping. I found Ameya stealing the beans I harvested 10 days ago. I caught him at the spot. So we must do according to the rule, offering an apology to the god of Mt. Nara Right! Search the house! I found it. Jinsaku, no more? No more. Bastard! How is it? Too much! Your field cannot even harvest half of these. No wonder the potato harvest wasn't good this year. You've digged out even they are not grown. Look, here is such a small one. Ameya's ex elder also had offer an apology to the Mt. Nara. Please let me go! I have so many family to feed. Many family? Who made them? You still have guts for a complaint? I am wrong, I know I did wrong. Asakichi, Asakichi. Asakichi, I beg you, Matsuyan is your wife. Idiot, that's nothing to do with this! Everyone's life is hard here. Ameya's stealing habit is in their blood. Two generation offering an apology! I can't see Kohe. This time, offering an apology is not enough, we have to think of something else. Kohe's husband past away just now. Everyone share them equally. I heard when steaming beans if you eat more you will have more beans. Eat the bean and you have more beans? Then you don't have to plant beans anymore. Why? You just need to put them in the pot and keep on boiling! Is it so? I think she is not here to be Asakichi's wife but was driven out of the house by her family. The baby in the stomach is already 5 months old, food for two... Do you think we pass this winter? We cannot just let Ameya go like this. We need to come up with something soon. Otherwise, we can't even sleep peacefully! If we leave them, they will start stealing again. What should we do? We need to discuss this. We are going to have a gathering at Teruyan. You must come too. I go and inform others too. Please do so! Tonight... that... We need to be well prepared. We decided to get rid of Ameya in roots. No exception for Matsuyan too. You have to be ready for this. But she is already in Neko family and also have Neko's baby inside her stomach. No exception. No exception. Tatsuhei, you are always like this. That's why people say you are like Rihe. It hurts! You said I am like my dad? It hurts. Who said it? It hurts! Go and discuss with your mom. I?ll come for a gamble tonight. Idiot! Divide them into 3 portion. Understood? Listen, one will lose. No objection, right? I won! I will take this. The long one, the long one. I am sorry. I wish it was a girl, then we don't need to kill it. We can even sell her. Matsuyan, Matsuyan Ameya don't have food tonight, so you bring these to them. You can also stay there tonight and take care of them. It?s done. Tatsuhei, Tatsuhei. Stinky, Risuke. Asakichi, don't you come! Why? Nothing special. Is it delicious? Help! Matsuyan, Matsuyan. Dad! Help! No, Asakichi, Asakichi. Wait! Matsuyan, Matsuyan! Matsuyan! Asakichi, Asakichi! Wait! Everyone wait for a while! Drop them in! No! Wait, you idiot! She has my baby in her stomach. Matsuyan! Asakichi! Let's go! Granny, what happened to the Ameya family? Where is Matsuyan? Oryuu, don't talk about it! You must not mention about Ameya anymore. Go to sleep. Asakichi, come in and warm yourself. Granny, you lied to her! Asakichi You lied to Matsuyan to go back to Ameya! Why? Why did you have to send her back? You killed her! Bastard! Granny monster. Mom. Why did you not tell me? Mom. I am going up to the mountain this winter. My maiden family?s granny also went up, auntie in this family also went up, I must go up too. It is hard to live down here. If I go up, I can meet Matsuyan there. Going to see Matsuyan. It's okay, one less mouth The "rat-baby" also dead. We can pass this winter without a problem. "Rat" will be back pretty soon. Cotton cloth isn't allowed in the Mountain no matter how cold. Stupid! It?s not there for you to worship. Later on, you worship the god of the House. Yes. Be quick with it. Idiot, take off your underwear. Okay. Come up quickly. No, not there, stupid! Yes, right, it's there, move your waist. Ah... I can't hold it anymore! It was Katsuzouday before and Ogen yesterday, it's moving up from the west, which means it's my turn today. I can't stand the excitement! She is coming. Shit! I am not included? Idiot! Shit! Stinky woman! Stinky, you deserve it, not being included! Your wife was killed and no one wants to marry you! Here is the woman who wants to marry me! You are laughing at me, Harumatsu. You are looking down on me, you idiot! I need to teach you a lesson! I won't let you go! You idiot! Harumatsu... Harumatsu... Shit! Harumatsu! You idiot! I heard Kohe jump over your room. I don't care, I don't care! You can't give up on yourself like this! I'll try my best to let you enjoy one night. Is Kohe coming to pick me up? Stupid! No, not her. Listen, only one night, no more than that! When? Soon. But you have to improve yourself. You cannot act like a fox, damaging the field and abuse Harumatsu. One for a night! It's like what I said last night, just put up with him for a night. What if he kills Harumatsu? We cannot pass this winter safely. If he damages the field, the result is as clear as a crystal. Please, give it to him for one night. He stinks so much so if I ask someone I have no money and no potatoes. Who told you to gamble with potatoes? Just put up with him... Stop winding, I understand hearing once. You didn't go and see Risuke, he has no heart to work right now. I know he is smelly so you don't want him. But you only have to bear him for a night. I am sorry, I cannot accept him. I will be dead! It is your husband's last word! You cannot just pass by Risuke! I went to my husband grave this morning and begged him not to include the Stinky on the list. Then, a big butterfly flew to me. It's still autumn! You mean your husband became a butterfly? Yes. Flying very happily. He looked really happy. So I came down with the definite "yes". I have a bad nose, cannot smell anything. Of course it doesn't matter. You mean you will help me with this? It?s not that I don't like but I didn't use it for too long. I don't know whether I can still use it or not. No problem, he is a cherry boy. He wouldn't know whether it's old or new. I will go up tomorrow. Call those people who been to Mt. Nara tonight. It?s too early! Quick! Call them over! Mom! Go and call them over quickly. If not, they will all go up to the mountain to work and you can't find them anymore. I saw him, I saw Rihe. Where? At the plain in the west mountain. I will call everyone over. Dear, Rihe! It was his soul! You cannot just return in soul now, I will never forgive you! You keep hesitating there, I am going up to the mountain. I will never look for you. You rubbish! When I was 15, I went to bear hunting with dad. When coming back, I killed him here. After thinking over and over I told dad to bring granny up to the mountain. He suddenly got mad and shouted at me saying "what do you know!" and started to beat me up. I fired at him and buried him there. Tatsuhei, it's true I like Rihe a lot but he is the laughingstock in the village. You didn't kill him, it's the god of the mountain. Don't tell anyone about this, understood? Tatsuhei. Tamayan, distinguish the light. Asakichi, if you are done there bring the rice sake here. Clean the bottom well. Tatsuhei, it is bit early but go and have a bath. Ryu, it's okay. Tamayan, come here for a minute. Granny, you are really good in catching fish. If you see carefully in the daytime, you can see the fish playing. Go slowly and when the fish hides below the stone, remember that place. Come back at night and catch them with your hand. You come and try this time. Tatsuhei asked you to entertain Risuke for a night? Yes. You've to refuse firmly. Yes. Put your hand into there. Caught it! Yes, like this way, like this way. Now, I have nothing more to teach you. You can't tell anyone about this place. You have to come alone to catch. Going up the mountain is a very hard thing. Take care. Good Sake! You are the best! Getting everything ready well. The rule must be kept going up the mountain. One, you cannot talk while you are going up. You cannot let anyone see you when you go up. Going up, you have to pass through the foot passing the tree, go up the third mountain then you will see a pond. Go around 3 times and go up the stair case. Go over one mountain and you'll come to the deep valley. Go around the mountain about 10 km, you'll come across seven turns which is called seven valleys. Passing by the valley, will come to "horse-back". From there it's path to the Mt. Nara. Mt. Nara has path but no path. You go up straight. The god will be waiting for you there. When coming down, do not look back. If you can't bear it, you don't have to go up. You can reach "horse-back" and come down. This is a secret, not supposed to say it so have to say it quietly. I've already told you. Here... here... here... Rhythmic, still usable. Tatsuhei. Osuzu. What happened? He bit off the rope and ran away. Really ashamed of you. You... How can you offend the god of the Mountain? While alive, the god and your son it's not good to cut the fate this way. Dad, come back here! Stupid. What are you doing? Nothing, this is a rabbit's tooth. My lucky charm. Went back? Mom, are you tired? I don't need it, mom, you have it. For many hundred years, our ancestors have passed this path. Many hundreds of them... thousands of them. May be more. After 25 years, I will be here too, Asakichi carrying me. After 25 years, Asakichi will be in my shoes. No other way. I heard the god of the mountain waits at the top. Is it true? If there is really a god, it should snow like in the lyrics. After killing my dad, I am now killing my mom. Dad, dad. Let go! Dad. Go up the mountain! It?s snowing! It?s snowing! Mom, it's snowing! Mom. You must be very cold. Mom, it's lucky to snow while you are going up the mountain. It really is snowing. Neko family's granny Osuzu is a lucky person. Snowing while going up the mountain. Very cold, right? It just snowed right. So good. You must be hungry. Granny is so lucky! It is same as the lyrics. It smells so good! From tonight, she'll be having meal at our place. No matter how cold it is, you cannot wear cotton cloth when going up the mountain. No matter how hard it is, when snow flakes falls on Mt. Nara, all the hardship will disappear!
