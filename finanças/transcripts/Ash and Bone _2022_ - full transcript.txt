Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, please. Oh, yes, yes. Stop. Stop, stop. No, no. Please. It's okay. Hey, I know. Well, that looks good. Well, I know what I'm having. Oh, yeah, what are you getting? Chicken Caesar salad. Old faithful. Yeah, sounds good, but, uh, I'm gonna find out how the burgers are. Uh, miss. Uh, how are your burgers? They're good. I eat one almost every day. Oh, wow, uh, ringing endorsement here. I will have one with, uh, cheese, no pickles, please. Okay. Chicken Caesar salad. Sounds good. Last but not least. Cassie, can you order something off the menu? Can I get something for you? I don't know, what's good here? The chicken Caesar salad. Dude, I'm fucking with you. Diner food is all the same. Cassie. What? It's true. Give me like a waffle or something. Whatever won't give me E. Coli. Sure thing. That'll be coming right up. Cassie, that was inappropriate. Whatever, Sarah. You're one to lecture on what's appropriate and what's not. Yo, Cass. What's up? Watch this. Could be an Olympic sport. Yeah, right. That is metal as fuck. If you say so. Your dad is calling. So? What did you tell him? Didn't tell him anything, just left. It's been weird ever since Sarah moved in. Well, I know what will make you feel better. Damn, Tina, what a throw. Happy birthday. What a cute little town. Yeah. Is it like you remember? Yeah. I mean guess the buildings look old. Well, I have news for you, buddy. Oh, yeah, what are you trying to say? Well, you said so yourself, you haven't been here since you were a kid. What? 15? Almost. 30. I was, uh, I was younger than Cassie. There you go, I rest my case. Summer's nice but fall is when this town really comes to life. At least it used to. This place is nice, babe. Yeah. My brother did a job of keeping up with it. You know what? I should call him, let him know we're here. Oh, shit. Something wrong? Yeah, one bar of service, barely that. So you want me to help you bring some of your things inside? I can take care of myself, thanks. Hey, hey, Derek. Yeah, it's me, we, we just got here. The place looks great, man. What, what? The key, I thought, I thought you left one. Derek, you're, you're breaking up. You're saying something in the house. Cassie! It's a fucking cat. A goddamn cat. Uh, so your uncle says, "That there's a cat inside, and there's gotta be a hole somewhere where it keeps getting in" but, uh, guess it's better than a raccoon. It's okay. I'm trying. Like I'm really trying. I know, I know. Remember what the doctor said, "We'd have to be patient." "This will take a while, it's a huge change for her." It's a huge change for all of us. Yeah, yeah. It's nice. Yeah. Sure brings back memories. Oh, my God, we might not need cellphones after all. We have dial tone. Found my bedroom. So we're gonna be cozy in for a little bit, but I think it's good for us. Hey, if you wanna get the rest of your stuff from the car, go ahead and do that while we get dinner ready. What do you have planned? You'll see. Dinner is served. So this, this is your plan. Yeah. All those years in the city you never had yourself a good ol' American hot dog? I was a vegetarian for most of it. What happened? Pardon? I said, "What happened?" Why aren't you a vegetarian anymore? I don't know. I just tried a few things and then I stopped. Just stopped. Cassie, you can leave her alone. What? Just trying to get to know her better. Right, Sarah? I'm serious, knock it off. This whole thing's bullshit. No, you know what? This whole thing is for you. For me? Oh, yeah, that's funny, 'cause I thought the whole reason why we're here so you could pat yourself on the back, tell yourself what a good dad you are. I'm trying to help you. You're trying to control me. Hey, let her go, all right? We can't keep let her disrespect you like this. Seriously we gotta take a stand. But I can take it. What? You know what? I've had enough. What are you doing? I'm, I'm calling the local sheriff. She's out of control. You can't be serious right now. She could be on her way back to Detroit right now. She is a teenager rebelling against her dad. Fine. Fine. - Lou. - Hey, Sheriff. Hey, you're too young to be in here. Scram. I'm 21, I just look young. Bullshit. Let me see your ID. Seriously? As a heart attack, young lady. There you go. From the city, huh? Yeah. Where are you staying? I know enough not to tell you that. Smart city girl. What do you have? Beer. Whatever you have, I don't care. You look a little far from home, little missy. Hey, did you hear me? You crazy bitch. Hey! Leave her alone you sack of shit! I'll fuck you up if you come near me. Hey, there's no fighting in my bar. Take this shit outside now. Everyone needs backup every once in a while. Thanks. No sweat. Do you wanna sit down? Sure. I'm Tucker, and this is Anna. How's it going? You're not from around here are you? No, I'm from the city. Oh, shit. Been a long time since anyone came from that way. Long, long time. The only people that come around here are runaways, right? Not that there's anything wrong with that. Relax, I'm not a runaway. If anything I'd be going the other way. Besides I thought this was a vacation town, cabins and shit. Yeah, used to be, not anymore. Hold up. Hey, Louie. Can we get three over here? It's not often someone like you comes in this bar. We'd know, we're here almost every night. Pretty much. Cheers. Clinky. Now we're official friends. This town isn't close enough to the ocean or even Lake Ontario for that matter to make it anyone's worth while. So why do people come here? To hunt, to look at the leaves, right? That's pretty much it. Well, that sucks. No, it's not all bad. I mean it's quiet. So what do you guys do for fun around here? You're looking at it. Mostly get fucked up. I guess that's true anywhere. You see where I come from we check out old buildings, blown off factories, urban exploring, you know. Hmm, I've seen photos like that. We don't have anything like that here. No haunted cemeteries? Maybe an old barn or something. There's gotta be a place around here. There is the McKinley house. Sorry. I mean it's not something that- Anna. You're right, I probably shouldn't have said anything. Hey, come on, guys, that's no fun. It's just a legend. - Anna. - Tucker. It's just this old house on the outskirts of town. Same family's lived there for like a hundred years. People around here don't really like to talk about it. Kinda bad vibes, you know? A brother and sister live there with their mom. They don't come around here much. They do, they're creepy. Did anything happen? All right. They're from all over the state. Are these- - But nobody can prove anything. Hell, nobody even really knows if they're still in the house. But there have been rumors of kidnapping, slavery, and- Murder. Where is it? What? Where is it? I wanna go check it out. Are you listening? This is serious. Come on, guys, every town has a local legend like this. They're all bullshit. No, this is different. This girl just went missing. She was visiting just like you, never been heard from again. And that could be anything. Well, I appreciate your ghost stories but I gotta roll. I gotta find this house while it's still dark. Cassie. I don't think there's too many road around here, I'm pretty sure I can find it. Don't be stupid. It's not safe. I can handle myself. Thanks. Unless, you guys wanna come, get it over with. I'll probably be bored with it anyways. Up to you. Let's just show her where it is. She can get her picture, and we can get out. There it is. The McKinley house. I can't see anything in there. There aren't any cars in the driveway. Where would they be this late at night? Whoa, hey, hey. You're not going in, are you? I just wanna check it out. Promise. This was a mistake. It'll be fine. - Wow. - Yeah, wow. Okay, now let's go. Cassie, I meant leave. Man, this is creepy. Yeah, I told you. What do you see? It's dark, I can't tell. Cassie. Oh, my God. Hell are you doing? Oh, shit. Can't let her go by herself. Oh, gosh. Oh, this place reeks. Oh, God. All right, let's take a look around and get the fuck out of here. You say you don't see much of the McKinleys, right? Yeah. Well, this explains how they're living. Hm? Edna McKinley, she's been dead for years. Who's she? She's the grandmother. - What the hell? - Can you believe this? Frickin' criminals. All right, let's get the hell out of here. There's nothin' to see here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, whoa, Cassie, come on. Fuck, no, absolutely not. Are you kidding me? - Oh, my gosh. - What the hell did you get me into, Tucker? I didn't want to come. Yes, you did. Oh, this is unreal. What the hell is that smell? I don't know. Oh, it's so bad. What's this? Hey, hey. She's crazy. Guys. What the hell? Oh, my God. They're into some sick shit. Guys. Please don't hurt me. Oh, my God. What's the matter? You didn't like meeting Momma? That was her. - Yeah. - Ah. Who? That's uh, Molly, she- Fuck you! She's been missing for months. No. God. Look. - God. - Oh, my God. It's all of 'em. Oh, shit. You best check that van down by the road. I'm right behind you. - All right. - Shit. Shit. Oh, god. Fucking varmints. May! Guys. Guys. I think now's our chance. Okay. - Go, go. Okay, I don't see anyone, let's go. Different directions, and meet at the van. Shit. Come on. Oh, shit! Hurry, hurry, come on! Oh My God Lucky bugger you. Where is she? Come on, come on, come on! Stay down! Oh, God. - Get in, hurry. - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, come on, go, go. Don't worry, I marked it. Good news is the bullet just grazed me. And the bleeding stopped, so I'm not gonna die. Of course you're not gonna die. Don't say that. Joking. I don't know how you can joke after what we just went through. I know, I'm sorry. What do we do? I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go home, pop a bottle of whiskey, and pass out. Guys, we have to call someone. You don't get it. Somethin's up with this town and that family. It's not just a rumor anymore, and for all we know everyone's in on it. I mean how do get away with all of that? We can't trust anyone. Yeah, he's right. You don't wanna mess with these people. Cassie! Anything, anything you'd like to tell me? Dad. You can, you can be honest. As a matter of fact I really need you to be honest right now. I, I don't know what happened. You don't know. No. You come home in the middle of the night with a gunshot in the van, and you don't know what happened. I don't know. I met some kids my age, it was nothing. Honey, we should at least consider- Look, I'm horrified. I'm horrified. Dad, really. Honey, she says she doesn't know what happened, and she obviously doesn't know, okay? I believe her. Fine. Fine, fine. Oh, shit. Bones creaky. Good afternoon. Hey, uh, thanks for coming out, Sheriff, especially on such short notice. Hey, it's all part of the job. Nice spread out here. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. So my daughter she, uh, she took the van out last night, and, uh, says nothing happened. Teenagers. Well, I do believe her. Hm. Well, we do have our share of issues out here, Mr. Vanderbilt. Couple labs out in the woods. I'm sure you've seen that on Discovery Channel. Fact of the matter is, it was probably someone doing some night hunting, which of course is illegal. So you don't think anybody was trying to send a message or something? And why would you think that? Do you have reason to believe somebody would wanna hurt you or your family? I mean no, not, probably nothing. Well, uh, you better tell me. My daughter Cassie, she, uh, she got in trouble in the city, and nothing, nothing major, but, uh, there was some bad apples in her group. - Huh. - And, uh, we actually came up here to, you know screw her head on straight. Yeah, I can see. Well, I suppose somebody could have followed you all the way from Detroit up here. I'll file a report, keep an eye out. Do you, uh, you carry? No. Well, uh, I'd change that. There's some tough types up here. If you see anybody doing anything they shouldn't be just leave 'em be, call me, okay? Yeah. I got the number to a good glass man. Take care. Well, how'd it go? I mean, it went good I guess. Uh, he said, "He's gonna help us, but there's only so much he can do." Yeah. I'm gonna go to town and, uh, and get a couple things. I can go with you. I'll be quick. I think it's a good idea. Hey, Cassie. Um, we're just gonna run to town. If you could, we'll, we'll be back soon. Oh. Of course. Hello. Tina. Cass. Cass, what is up, girl? Not much, just enjoying, enjoying the fresh air. You good? What's going on? Something happened. One sec. Well, I met these people, and we went exploring, you know like we used to do, and then we found something. Oh, man, that was good. Mm-hmm. Gonna have somethin' else next time though. I really like that rocky road. Mmm. Oh, babe, uh, I've been meaning to pick up some eggs and milk for the morning. All right. I have another stop, so I'll see ya. - Bye. - Bye. Okay. Cass, you have to go to the police. And say what? I was breaking in when I found this evidence. That's three strikes. Who, who gives a shit if you put two rapist away? You don't understand, these people, they'll come after me if they found this out. They'll go after my dad and Sarah. I should just pretend this never happened. You know what you're doing. Afternoon. So you got something in mind? Uh, yeah. What about, what about that one? You sure? Here. See how this feels. Yeah, this is, uh, this is light. Yeah, it's not good for nothing other than shooting squirrels. You're not shooting squirrels are you? No. Uh. So, um, what about the one on the bottom? Good choice. That's American made. Won't jam up on you. See if that feels better. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right, I'll ring you up over here. Okay. So how does this work? Do I fill out like an application or something? You ain't from around here are you? Shit. Yeah. I was hoping we could wait a bit after the last one. If we keep this up, Vinny, he's gonna come calling. I don't think we got a choice. He could be on his way already. So how you wanna do this? I know the one boy, Tucker something. He lives with his grandma off 54. Tucker, that boy is a pussy. I can make him flap his lips. And the van we saw down by the road? That's out-of-towners. I never seen that van here before. We'll get 'em. 'Cause whoever was in Momma's room gonna pay. So what are we waiting for? Burton's Station. Anna. Tucker. Are you okay? I, uh, I just wanted to see if you were at work. Tucker, you don't sound good. What's going on? I'm sorry. Tucker. Tucker. Goddammit. You remember me? Oh, shit, oh, shit. Tucker, you fucking. No, no, no. Fucking got us. Shit. Oh, shit. No. You've been here before, haven't ya? Well, there's a reason I didn't gag ya. Talk to me dammit. You got the wrong people, I'm telling you, please. That's not what he said. Right, bitch boy? I didn't, I swear. You swear? Then how'd you get this? My sister, she's a good shot. Not often she misses the ticker. I'll bet ya she's glad she did. Now yous had a third driving the van. It wasn't you in Grandma's room. No, that girl she had different hair, I saw it. Who was she? Anything yet? We're working on it. So your buddy here says, "You didn't tell no one about what you saw the other night." No, no, I swear, we haven't gone to the police. We haven't gone to anyone. We won't tell anyone. Please just let us go. That was fuckin' stupid of you. You got one chance of gettin' out here alive. Who was the other girl? Huh? Cassie. Her name is Cassie. See I told you his lips were looser than a uterus on a broodmare. Where can I find this Cassie? This- - Don't tell him. Cassie. No, never mind her, you tell me. She's from the city with her family at the old Vanderbilt place. The Vanderbilt place. Oh, no shit, huh? I used to run with those boys way back. I'll betcha they remember me. I'm gonna go over there and scope it out. No, not yet. Not yet? We gotta figure out what we're gonna do with these two yet, huh. Please let us go. We won't say anything. We won't say anything about your Grandma. He talked about Grandma. I heard him. I don't like that. I know. But what about her? She's cute. You want it? Thanks. That was so much fun. But we got a problem. The Vanderbilts, they got money. They go missing the city gonna come callin'. And if the city come call in, ' our cousin, he gonna lose his mind. Well, I think it's a little late for that. I guess so. Tuck away the girl. Okay. There she is. Let's get you all cleaned up, shall we? It's your lucky day boys. The freezer's full. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. You just seem, you just seem kinda quiet. Sorry. It's nothing to apologize about. I just wanna be there for you. Be there? Uh, yeah, uh, like a parent, a sister, a hybrid I guess. Look, you're not my mom or my sister. You're just the woman who's fucking my dad. Well, I don't think that's a very appropriate way to speak to me. I don't give a shit. Now you wait here. I may not be your mother, but you're not 18 either. Don't touch me. You wanna help me? Huh, you wanna be there for me? Then leave me the fuck alone. Cassie. Cassie. Fucking shit. Hello? Anybody there? Dad. Dad, can you hear me? Shit. Where's home? Momma always told us not to play with our food. That she did. But I want this one to hurt. Then hurt her. Here, kitty. I got you a treat. Come on. What are you doing? Um, I, uh, trying to find that cat. I even got it a treat. I'd leave it out but I don't wanna attract any bears so. Yeah. Sarah, she told me what you said. I should apologize, I know. Well, that would be a start. I'm just, I'm kinda dealing with a lot right now. Well, that's just it. Uh, I mean I don't think you understand that, that so is she, so am I. We're all, we're all dealing with a lot right now. That's not my fault though. Well, some of it is, and, and that's a fact. Why don't you ever try to talk to me? Why don't you? You've always seen me as a problem child, something to fix like I'm one of your patients. You drag me all the way over here away from my friends. You bought a mini van. What are you gonna do with a mini van in the city? Um, uh, try to provide you with a normal life. Like at least as normal as I can. You took me away from Mom. Cassie, no, that's not fair. Do you know how much I visit her? Do you? I visit her every Friday after school with some friends. You know Tina, the girl that you called a bad influence in front of the judge? Yeah, she brings flowers to Mom's grave, Mom's grave. I'm sorry. How, how would I know? That's the problem, you wouldn't. May I please borrow the van? For what? I wanna see my new friends. Sure. Just please, please be careful. Please. Hey, baby. Hey. So, uh, that errand that you ran the other day. Yeah. What were you doing? Uh, you know I, I ran to the corner store, I, I was gonna see if they still had, uh, video tapes and stuff for rental, but I guess they stopped doing it years ago. So, um, I'm guessing that it has nothing to do with the gun that I found in our bedroom then. Look, I just wanted to keep us safe. - You know the statistics, and you bring a gun into our home. I know it probably seems way out of character but with all troubles, Cassie, and then the bullet hole in the van, and then- - But you see this. This right here, Lucas, is what's making her crazy. You're over analyzing and controlling. A hunting accident happens and you bring a gun into our home. Do we really know it was a hunting accident, like really? No, but I'm pretty positive. Look, just lay off, okay? Quit trying to control everything all the time. Let people in situations breathe. I want that thing out of our cabin. Do what you need to do. I'm so bored. Let's do something. Like what? I mean we could shred these beautiful curtains. Now that sounds like, shit, it's the fucking cops! Shit, I just got over provo. Shh. Fucking kids. Dispatch, it's just a couple kids tagging the old school on Third. Yeah, I'll look out for 'em. Go, go, go, go, go, go. - Cass. - Dude, we gotta do it. You're shitting me. When are we gonna have another chance to take a cop car for a joy ride? You're being an idiot. Come if you want. Dammit. Hey! Shit! Dude. You the Vanderbilt girl? Yeah. I was at your place the other night. Your, your dad called me. I saw you. I didn't think you were 21. Relax, I'm not gonna bust you. My office received a couple calls, I was wondering if you could help me. Me? Yeah, just some small stuff. I don't know if I would be much help. Well, let's see. Lou says, "You were in here with Tucker Samson and Anna Wilson the other night." Is that true? Yeah, we had a few drinks. Yeah. Anything else? You go for a ride maybe? Yeah, but that's it. We went for a ride. Smoke some dope? We, uh, we, uh. I'm giving you a hard time. I'm just asking 'cause Tucker and Anna are missing now. Tucker's grandmother says, "He was in here last." And Anna's employer says, "She didn't show up at the station at shift change." That's terrible. Yeah, I thought so too. They're probably just on some kind of lover's retreat or something. Did they, did they say anything, or give a hint, or any detail of what they were doing? No, they didn't mention it. You sure? Yeah. You wouldn't be hiding something from me would you little lady? No, sir. Here, take this. If you hear anything, anything. I will. Good girl. Lou, keep your nose clean. - Sheriff. - Boys. Better have them tags registered. I, uh, I'm taking care of things. And I think after I do we should have like a family meeting. I think we would all benefit from that. What was that? I'm not sure. Oh, my! Baby, stay inside, stay inside. Oh, my God. I'm sorry but the call cannot be connected as dialed. Shit. Dad. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, look at me. Sarah. Cassie. Cassie, Cassie, you need to get out. - It's okay. - Cassie, you need to run. It's okay. No, no, Cassie, you don't understand. They're here. Cassie, they're here and they're gonna kill us. - I got you. Please go now. No, hang on, almost got it. Cass, Cassie, he's right behind you! No, don't. Don't move. You remind me of my pa. Didn't much like him. My brother and I, we stuck closer to our momma. It's, it's a good thing too, 'cause made it easier when she decided to gut him with the Bowie knife. Anyway, she used to read us stories. Oh. Oh, that's so pretty. Look it. Why are you doing this? You ever read your daughter stories? Huh? - No. - No? No, of course not. Your kind never does. Well, do you know the story about William Tell? Do ya? - No. - No. Public schools these days. What the fuck do I know, right? You should stay still. Real still. 'Cause I'm a pretty good shot so this probably won't hurt. No, don't Oh, that's way too close. Hey. It's for sissies. Come on. There. That's better. Wish me luck. One, two, and a half. You got any real food around here? Besides yourself. I'm starving. Fuck you. What's that? Fuck you! The language in your generation it's not becoming. Somebody needs to teach you young ladies some manners. What, what are you even doing here? You don't know. Ask this one. Tell her! Some friends and I went to their house. Trespassed is more like it. Do you know what that means? That means I can't let you survive the night. I think your Pa's out there causing trouble. I'm gonna go look. Hey. Hey. Hey. I, I don't understand. They've been keeping girls locked in their basement. Torturing them, keeping them prisoner. And their mother, she. Why didn't you go to the police? I was afraid. I thought maybe they wouldn't find me and all this would go away. Kind of like- But this is different. If you saw what you say you saw they would have understood. Maybe. Wait, sheriff gave me his card. I think it was like 805-5557. Go to the land line, and hurry before they come back. 80. Hurry. Trying. Hello. Sheriff Vincent, this is Cassie Vanderbilt. We need your help. Wait, wait, hold on. My family's being held. I don't know where my dad is. It's the McKinleys, fucking McKinleys. And they took Tucker and Anna. And now they're after me and my- All right, all right, slow down. You're at the cabin? Yes. Okay. Please hurry. Need your help. I gotta go. Hurry. Wait, Cass. Dad. You can't get away. No sense trying. I told you I was good with a gun. Just off him, May. We can't keep 'em all. Huh. You know what, what if I wanna use me a man? What do you think about that? I'm all the man you need. Says you. You always get all the girls you want. What if I wanna use him? Yuck. What? A man and a man, it ain't natural. Well, then you can just watch or you can push the little record button and go piss off. I don't give a shit. Beside the fire needs some tending. You should do that. You best mind who you're talking to. Momma said, "I would run the farm when she was gone." You always say that, but the funny thing is, is I don't remember ever hearing it! So where might the bedroom be? Fucking bitch. Everything I done for her and this family. Jesus. What are you doing? Don't be afraid. Oh, God. Please don't. My brother Clete says, "I got me a pretty smile." You think I got a pretty smile, huh? You don't have to do this. You try anything and I'll fucking cut your daughter's head off with a pair of scissors, and she will feel every second of it. Please don't, don't, don't. Shh. Shall we see what we're working with? Oh, God. Shit. Dammit, Clete! Sheriff. Remember what we talked about? No city folk. Absolutely none. I know. Then why'd you do it? You're not listening. Should of seen me spinning my wheels when they called me out here. Y'all shot at them when they driving. They came to my farm, Sheriff. I don't give a shit! Is May in there? Yeah. And the Vanderbilts, they alive? Okay. Okay, good. You know what this means? Nah, Vinny, I don't. Remember what we talked about all those years ago. Runaways and strays, that's it. We're not slaughtering families in their houses. It's we now. You never let me have a say. You wouldn't even make me a deputy. Yeah. I would never survive re-election. I, I did it for both of us. For the family. If you and May would have laid low. That was never the plan. Grand pop said, "I was the next one." I was the oldest cousin. The smartest cousin. So smart you got caught, Clete. You did the one thing and you got fucking caught. I feel sorry for you, all those years in there must have something to your brain. Just come with me. You're shitting yourself. If this goes any further it'll be bad for both of us. And you knew that when you drove up here. If you take me in, I'll show 'em the tapes. I got a whole stash of 'em with you in 'em and the young girls. What? You need to take better inventory of your stuff 'cause I nabbed it years ago. Let's do us both a favor and just get in the car with me. I'll grab your crazy sister. Nah. We ain't going nowhere. You know, I'm getting real tired. Can't trust nobody no more. Not even family. When we were younger, you used to follow me around everywhere, and sometimes you lagged behind. You know what I used to say to get you to move faster? I used to say chop, chop. He's going to the fire. I can't get it. You're not gonna hurt my family! Untie you. Go get the gun, better run! Hurry! You don't know how to use that thing do you, huh? You probably don't either, city boy. - We gotta go. - Run. - Come on. - Go. You're not going anywhere. Come on, come on. Oh, my God, go, go. You're next, bitch! We're gonna find you. You can't hide, I promise. No. Son of bitch, this fuckin' hurts. Huh? You never been shot before? Not even on accident? No, Clete, 'cause I ain't no fuckin' retard. Those aren't gonna burn down all the way. I know. So you're wasting your time. No, I'm not, I cooking it. Ain't you got a girl to find? She'll come. They always do. That is if she loves you she will. Where are you little lady? Oh, that's a brilliant plan. She's probably half way to town by now. Fuck off, Clete. You are really gettin' on my nerves today. I'll let you live, I promise. If you come even quicker I'll even let your dad live. Now that's one hell of a bargain. Huh? Fuck Oh, shit. You watch him. - I'm watching him. All right, if he tries to get away you know what to do. She's really getting under my skin. Want a little Sheriff? You're next. Don't worry, she's probably using her tags. You dumb motherfucker. Go get 'em, May. Gotcha. What? May, you all right, girl? Looking for this? You should know better than to fuck with family. No, Cassie, don't. Looks like I did know how to use this. Don't worry, Dad. Bye, motherfucker. It's okay, Dad. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, my God. Sarah. You can't get rid of me that easy. - Oh, my God. - Hey. - Yeah I got it. - You sure?
