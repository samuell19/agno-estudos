Three, two, one. It's 2:00 a.m.. It didn't ring. It didn't ring. Was that a lie? It's gotta be a lie. Let's wait a little longer. Hey, don't answer that. Hello? Do you hear me? Hey, you... Hello? Do you hear it? What? I didn't hear anything. Hello? Umm... We're on our way to you now. I have a bad feeling about this... We've just walked into a tunnel. Akina, let's go back. Hey, Yuma. Are you gonna wimp out on me? So be quiet. Okay. Okay. Come on, just take the shot. So annoying. Rumor has it that if you go here, you won't survive. This is the most terrifying place in Japan, the Inunaki Tunnel. I'm here to present you with a real-life footage. Hey... It's so disgusting. H... Hey! Wait a minute! I found it. From this point forward, the Constitution and laws of Japan do not apply here. No way... Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hey! Did you see it? Slow down. It's a house. Scary. Do you see it? Wait... Okay, we're rolling. Please look at this. This is the real deal. It's the real Inunaki village! No, it's too dark. Here. H... Hey! Wait... Hey! Stop that! I knew it. Huh? Can you turn off the camera for a second? What is it? What the? Do you need to go to the bathroom? Don't go anywhere. Give me some space, don't listen to it. Which is it? What the hell is this?

He won't tell me either. But he has nightmares every night. He looks so distressed and sad. Would you mind if we went into the other room to listen to what you have to say? Okay. Ryo-chan, Mama is going to the other room for a while. You need to tell the Doctor about your dream. Okay? Is there something you don't want your Mama to hear? Because... Huh? Ryo-chan, can't say it. Who's that? Mama... Mama? Your Mama is not in the room right now. Mama is in here... Your Mama's in here? Well... You have to keep it a secret, or Mama will get upset. Thank you. Thank you for looking after him. Hey, Ryo-chan say goodbye to the Doctor. What's wrong, Doctor Morita? I think I'd rather not be that kid's primary care doctor. I'm home. Welcome home. So what is it this time? There's something wrong with Akina. Ever since she got home this morning. What's wrong with her? That's why I'm asking you, because I don't know. What is it? Is it a spiritual kind? Huh? Well... Where'd you go this morning? Inunaki tunnel. Inunaki tunnel? Eh? Really? Yuma, did you went inside the Inunaki tunnel? That's awesome... In fact, I am investigating the Inunaki tunnel. As a research for school. What about the village? Is there really a village there? You know that? Of course, I do. You don't know? It's a very famous haunted place. A haunted place? Hey, what are you doing? Because of Akina. She must've been cursed. Everyone knows that. There's no such thing. Kota. Don't investigate this. Go play on the side. I'm sorry. Hey, Yuma. Can you please not get Kota involved in this nonsense? I don't want that kid to end up like you. Hey, the way you said it... Kanae, shut up! Hey, I'm going out. Okay. Who does he think he is? He really does have the same filthy blood as you do. Be careful. Hey, wait! What's going on? Anyway, just take a look. Akina-chan is there? ♪ Close your eyes and don't look at the baby, just let it drift away. ♪ Eh? What the hell? She's been doing that for a while now. ♪ If the harvest is bad, then put a lid on it. ♪ ♪ Put a lid on it. ♪ ♪ If you don't have a dog, then put a lid on it. ♪ ♪ Close your eyes and don't look at the baby, just let it drift away. ♪ Akina-chan. Kanae-chan. Hey, what happened? Let me see. Are you sick? Sick? I'm not sick. Akina is doing great! What happened? I don't even know what happened. Akina saw it. What did you see? A dog. Dog? If the dog faces west, the tail faces east. If the dog is white... Translator's note: This has double meaning. The other being "that's interesting". That dog's tail is white too. Right? Akina-chan? I have to pee. Maybe it's culture-bound syndrome​. Or a short-term psychotic disorder. Hey, let's get her to the hospital... That's not what I asked you. Eh? Hey... You used to be able to see things, didn't you? You know, you used to say that when you were little... Stop that! Please look at this. This is the real deal.

Akina-chan! Hey, Akina. Where are you? Yuma, I'll be there. Huh? I'll be there soon. Soon. Soon. Soon. Look. Akina! Akina! Akina-chan! Hey. She's so young. Hey. What the hell happened? I thought you were together. Hey, aren't you guys together? Hey. Don't do that! Hey, what are you gonna do? For dating your family's useless son? That's what happened to Akina! To Akina! What are you gonna do? -Ikuo, stop it. -Let go. Stop. Stop. Hey, let go of me! I'm so sorry, Mr. Morita. Dad, why do you have to bow down to these people? Your granddaughter Akina died! Morita's son killed Akina! Mom. Akina. Akina. It hurts, doesn't it? Akina-chan's body had a lot of water in it. She was drowned. I knew it. They asked you to do the autopsy. If it was any other doctor. It could make things worse. Back in the day, we've seen the same thing over and over again. You remember, don't you? You and your father and Sendai. You and I were the only ones who knew what happened back then. The next one... Could be us. That reminds me. There's something inside Akina-chan's stomach. Your eldest daughter is very sensitive. Be careful. Doctor Yamanobe. How are you settling in at the hospital? I'm settling fine, thanks to you. You can always talk to me if you need anything. Thank you very much. Please excuse me. The dog is peeing. Is that Akina-chan? Come here. Big bro! Kota. I see. Maternity Health Record Book I see. Akina was gonna be a mom. Hey, Kota! Why do you leave them here. That research you were talking about the other day. Something about a cursed village, I think. Kota? I know. I'm not doing that research anymore. Why not? Because of Akina-chan. After she went into the Inunaki tunnel, she really.. Hmm... You're right. Hey, wait! What is that? My research project. Don't look! Did you make this? Yes. That's amazing. It's not easy to make so don't break it. Because if we make this kind of stuff, we might get really cursed. I don't know about that. But see, your brother is fine. Right. So where is this Inunaki Village? It's an urban legend because nobody knows about it. I see. It's a village that disappeared from the map. But it's got to be somewhere in this pass. The village that disappeared from the map... This is the Inunaki tunnel. This is where my brother and the others went before. This is the cursed phone booth. That's the red bridge... It's really dangerous. I don't feel like going this time. What, are you trying to run away? - I'm not running away. - Don't be ridiculous. Hey, come on, let's go. Hey, Kota! Big bro, are you going to Inunaki village? Kota... You go over there. Are you okay? No, he's really pissed off. He really did have a psychic experience. - It's definitely a lie. - That's a terrible lie. Huh? What's going on? Ouch. What the hell? Inunaki Tunnel What is this? This was not here when I went with Akina. Yuma! Yuma! Please don't make us do this! What else can we do? - Let's just go back. - Yuma! - It's really dangerous here. - I'm sick of this. Akina's gone! Don't fuck with me! I'm sorry. I don't know what it means. I don't even understand what that means! Yuma. Ryo-chan. - I'm going to the secret base. - Eh? Ryo-chan, come here and play. Doctor Morita. - Yes - Do you have a minute? What's wrong? This is Ryotaro's father. That said, well... I don't mind. Ryotaro is... He's not our real child. Eh? I didn't tell the kid. Actually, my wife doesn't know either. What do you mean by that? Five years ago, Yuko gave birth to a stillborn baby. Keisuke adopted the child while hiding it from herself. I was introduced to Dr. Uchida. Around the same time, there was a woman who gave birth in our hospital and died. She was a single mother with no relatives to turn to. Ryotaro was the child she gave birth to. Hey... Don't tell my wife about this. I won't. You have to keep it a secret, or Mama will get upset. Eh? Mama is in here... So... What's wrong? Ryo-chan, didn't I tell you to not throw things away? I'm so sorry, Doctor. It's okay. And what do you say? Thank you. That's... Ryotaro. Doctor, what's wrong? Doctor Morita? Doctor. Mama's not scary. NO! I'm sorry. What the hell? Yuma, you were crying, right? Understandable. It happened so fast with Akina. Speaking of which, what exactly is death? You shut up. Wow. It's here. It's real. Wow! Big bro! Hey! Come out. Hey! You can kill me, too. - Don't fuck with me! - Big bro! Why Akina? Get out! Hey! Big bro! Kota! Why are you here!? Kota, don't come any closer! Wait for me there. Kota, don't come down here. Big bro! I'm going over there now. Can you keep an eye out for me? That was close. What are you doing, idiot? Hey, are you okay? Hey, Kota. K... Kota! Don't come here! Big bro! Kota. It doesn't matter if it's rotten or not. If the harvest is bad, then put a lid on it. Put a lid on it. If you don't have a dog... Put a lid on it. How did they get here? Yuma said that there's a village at the end of this tunnel. They said they were attacked there when he went with Akina. That's stupid. What's at the end of this goddamn tunnel? But then again, why aren't they all sealed? We don't know about that... Wait... Yuma... This is Yuma's camera. He really did brought Kota with him. Hey, you guys came here together, right? Yes. But I don't think he brought his camera yesterday. So, where is Yuma? He went in. We desperately tried to stop him. But he won't listen, right? I'd like you to search this area. - Yuma! - Ayano, stop! What are you doing? Stop it. Don't do this. Stop. Wait, Ma'am! Stop Ayano! Stop it! Calm down. Don't do this. Mom. Honey. No! No! Ah.. Umm... It's too dangerous out here. Let's leave the search to the police. Where's Ryotaro now? He just had a panic attack. He was brought in by ambulance. He's calm now. He's sleeping in his room. Is that so? His parents are with him now. Okay, then you can head home now. Thank you. Doctor Uchida? Dr. Yamanobe has just been brought in from the hospital in a critical condition. Eh? Why? Well, we're still trying to figure it out. It's like... he drowned. - Where? - In his own home. Eh? - Taniguchi... - Ah, I'm sorry. We'll let you know when we know more. Seriously? I can't believe you're breaking down now. What the hell? Who is this? Unknown? What's going on? No way. Hello? Hey, my damn motorcycle just died. Can you pick me up? Yusei? - Yusei? - Yes. I can't help you. Where are you? I'm near the red bridge now. You've got to get over here. I'm always getting a weird feeling about this place. All right, wait for me. Yes? Excuse me. Doctor Morita. I'll see what I can do. I know you must be worried. But please go home for today. I see. Then we'll be counting on you. Yusei! Yusei! - Yusei! - Where did he go? Huh? Why isn't he here? Don't you usually stand here? Well, I think he's around here. Eh? - Yuji, you get it. - No, no, no. No, I won't. - Get it. - Just let it go. Hello? Hey, my damn motorcycle just died. Can you pick me up? Eh? Yusei? I'm near the red bridge now. You've got to get over here. I'm always getting a weird feeling about this place. What's going on? What? Who's calling? It's Yusei, but... Huh? Hey, my damn motorcycle just died. Can you pick me up? What's going on? I'm near the red bridge now. You've got to get over here. I'm always getting a weird feeling about this place. Where the hell are you now, Yusei? Hey, my damn motorcycle just died. Can you pick me up? I'm near the red bridge now. You've got to get over here. I'm always getting a weird feeling about this place. Hey! Ryotaro. What is it? My grandpa. He's calling me. Your grandpa? It's a grandpa I don't know. Put a lid on it. If you don't have a dog.. Put a lid on it. That song... ♪ Close your eyes and don't look just let it drift away. ♪ ♪ Hot or cold ♪ ♪ If that harvest... It won't open. I told you it wouldn't open. Wait... Hey, Yusei! Hey, my damn motorcycle just died. Can you pick me up? I'm near the red bridge... What the hell is this? Hey, Yusei! Hey! What's going on here? What is this? Eh!? Dr. Yamanobe The water's coming! Run! The water's coming! Run! The water's coming! Run! The water's coming! Run! The water's coming! Run! The water's coming. It doesn't matter if it's rotten or not. Huh? If the harvest is bad, then put a lid on it. -Why is there water? -What's going on here? What's going on!? What's this? Put a lid on it. If you don't have a dog, then put a lid on it. No, Yusei! Yusei! Yusei! Close your eyes and don't look at the baby, just let it drift away. Hot or cold Hey, hey, open it! If the harvest is bad, then put a lid on it. Put a lid on it. Yuji...help...help! If you don't have a dog, then put a lid on it. Help! Anyone! Close your eyes and don't look at the baby, just let it drift away. I don't care if it hurts. I don't care if it scares me. If the flowers are not in bloom Just put a lid on it. Ryotaro, come here. Close your eyes and don't look at the baby, just let it drift away. Eh? Your blood. Your blood. It's because you have the blood of a dog killer in your veins. Doctor Morita. Moments ago, Doctor Yamanobe has passed away. Yuma... - I found something! - Kota? Kota... Yuma... Yuma... Kota. - Is this a bag? - Yeah, it's a bag. That's Kota's stuff! - Ma'am! - That's Kota! It's a lost item. It's in our custody. - Kota! - We'll look into it. Dad... What? Hey... What's going on? Huh? My brother and Kota has disappeared. Why? Dr. Yamanobe-san passed away too. Last night. I see. Why is that? Dad, you know everything about it, don't you? I've been thinking... Why do you hate mom so much? No, I don't. You tell me. What's going on with our family's bloodline? What's going on in this house? Hey, hey! Tell me! Hey, what!? Have you... Have you gone crazy too? It's our family that's abnormal, isn't it? Hey, why? Say something. You have something to tell me, don't you? You don't need to know anything! Dad! I don't want to be with you... I'm scared. You people scare me. Eh? Since you were a kid, You saw something strange, didn't you? I don't want anything to do with your bloodline. You're Kanae, right? You've gotten so big. Grandpa... You look tired. But still, I see Ayano's face in there. Come on, come on. Let's go inside. I'm glad you came. I'm sure Yai is happy too. You two used to be really good friends. Do you remember? You two always used to... Just happy sitting together and whispering. I see. I see. It's your brother's fault. Grandma gave you two candies each. Such an older brother needs to be punished. Why is that? How did you know that my brother stole my candy? Kanae, you should know it too. Really? Be careful, brother. Kanae, I'll take all the candy from you! Just wait. Ouch. Damn it. Damn. See? He's been punished. Grandma, who's that? Really? Kanae, you saw him too? He's been trying to say something. He's been watching over us all the time. It's okay. He's not scary. He's not scary. There is something magical about her. The days she handed me an umbrella to go out it's going to rain that day. How else could she be right about a baby being born? And who died in the family? When she was a kid, I used to freak out too. And always teased me. You wanted to ask me something? Grandpa, are there any other relatives? You're the only relatives in our family. And Yai. There was a girl who was abandoned before here. She was just a baby then. It used to happen a lot. She was probably... She's probably from a nearby village. That village... is it Inunaki Village? How do you know that name? Speaking of it, your father... He'll probably just say it's all a bunch of nonsense. I knew it, was my grandma born in Inunaki Village? I don't know. It's hard to tell now. It's like there are people from Inunaki Village who have no one to turn to. I'm gonna go to the village. You can't. Inunaki village is now buried under the dam. Eh? Grandma, who's that? He's not scary. He's not scary. Why are you following me? Who are you? It doesn't matter what your superiors do. Eh? They'll just put a stinking lid on it. What happened to that village? I used to never thought about it of what I was born to do. I never really cared. Whoever you are. I know you know something. What is Inunaki Village? There's something I want to show you. It's the only remaining record of Inunaki Village. I'm the only one who knows. They live by killing wild dogs. They were called dog killers. Nobody wanted to go near them. But then suddenly there's a group of people who help them. If the harvest is bad, then put a lid on it. Put a lid on it. If you don't have a dog, put a lid on it. Close your eyes and don't look at the baby. Just let it drift away. You're not from the village, right? From this point forward, the Constitution and laws of Japan do not apply here. But the way they approached the villagers... it was on purpose. They're from the power company. To build a dam on that place. They used violence to suppress the villagers. His daughter and son are alive and well today. They forcibly imprisoned the women of the village. Rumors of them mating with dogs are spreading everywhere. Watch. Watch. Stop. Stop it! That's what they do. They try to put a lid on it as soon as they can. You can't stop. You have to see it for yourself. Look at them. Take a good look at them with your own eyes. The blood in your veins. It's because you have the blood of a dog killer in your veins. It doesn't matter if it's rotten or not. If the harvest is bad, then put a lid on it. Put a lid on it. If you don't have a dog, then put a lid on it. Stop... Stop it! Maya... You tell me. What's going on with our family's bloodline? And Yai. That was a girl who was abandoned before we got here. She was probably... She's probably from a nearby village. Why do you hate mom so much? I'm scared. You people scare me. I see Ayano's face in there. Kanae, you should know it too. Really? I don't want anything to do with your bloodline. Vandalized text: Get out of here. Filthy blood. Cursed home. Vandalized text: Stain on the town, dark history, murderers, bastard family. Mom! My sister put the lid on it. Close your eyes and don't look at the baby. Just let it drift away. Don't go there. Mom... Don't go! If the harvest is bad, then put a lid on it. Put a lid on it. They put a lid on the dog with my sister. Close your eyes and don't look at the baby. Just let it drift away. I don't care if it hurts. I don't care if it scares me. If the flowers are not in bloom, just put a lid on it. Mom... Ayano! Ayano! Ayano! Ayano! Ayano! Ayano! Ayano! Kanae... If the dog faces west, the tail faces east. If the dog is white, that dog's tail is white too. Right? Okay, Ayano! I'm not doing that research anymore. This is the cursed phone booth. That's the red bridge... I've come to Inunaki River now. And this is... a phone booth that works when the phone rings at 2:00 a.m.. Let's wait a little longer. It's not going to ring. I'm sure it'll ring. Three, two, one. It's 2:00 a.m.. It didn't ring. It didn't ring. Was that a lie? It's gotta be a lie. Let's wait a little longer. Hey, don't answer that. Hello? Do you hear me? Hey... Do you hear it? Umm... We're on our way to you now. I did it. The phone really rang. Then we'll head to Inunaki Village next. The Cursed Phone Booth At 2:00 a.m., there's a phone booth connected to Inunaki village. Hello? Help me. - Sister. - Kanae... - Kanae... - Sister, help me... Wait for me. I knew you'd be here. I have something to entrust to you. This is the place. This is Inunaki Village? Why did this happen? It's the power company's mess. They're just pretending that the whole thing didn't happen. Put a lid on it. This place is about to be flooded by a dam. Gone from the map. Stop! It's that house up ahead. Your brother and younger brother are in there too. Kanae. Kanae. Kanae. Hey. - Yuma! - Keep your voice down. Kanae, I'm here. Kota, are you okay? Kanae. Kanae. The key is inside there. Wait for me. Hey, come over here. They forcibly imprisoned the women of the village. Rumors of them mating with dogs are spreading everywhere. No... No way... Get the baby out of here. Get the baby out of here. - But... - Go. Just go. My baby... Maya. Give me back my baby. Maya, you can't take care of the baby. Give me that. Maya. - Give me that. - Just go! Please. At least get the baby out of here before this village is flooded. - But... - Only you can do that. - My baby! - Maya, no. You can't feed the baby right now. Come on, just go. Give it back to me. Kanae! Kanae! Here's the key, Yuma. Who is this baby? Never mind. Hurry up. Give it back to me. Kota, take the flashlight. Kota, you take care of that. We're counting on you on that baby. Go! Give it back to me. Hurry up! That child is the hope of this village. Don't let the blood of the village be cut off. Kenji, give it back to me. My baby. My baby. Maya. Maya. Maya. Maya? Maya? Wait a minute! Kota! Come on, let's go. Run... Akina. Akina. Akina. That's not our baby. Maya, no! Maya, no! Maya! Maya! Yuma! - Yuma! - Big brother! Yuma! Kanae, just go! Maya, stop it! - Go! - Big brother! My... Give me my baby. Give it back to me. Baby! My... Kanae! GO! We're counting on you on that baby. - Kota! - Big brother! Kota! My baby. - Go! - Go, Kanae! My baby! My baby! My baby! My baby! My baby! Give it back to me! My baby! Dad! What? What the hell is it? A baby. There's a baby out here. A baby? What are you talking about? Dad! Dad! I'm coming. I'm coming. Kanae! Hey, Kanae! What happened? Hey, Kota! Wake up! Wake up! Kota! Wake up! Kota. Big sis. I had a really scary dream. Where's Yuma? In the dream, he fought the girl monster to save us. Kota. That is not a monster. Her name is Maya. Maya? If it wasn't for her. We may never have been born. Let's take it. Okay, cheese! That's cute. Great shot. Great. The sea is so clear. Right? What sea? That is a lake. That's a good one. It's so cute. Not bad. Oh, my God, it's beautiful. That's a great shot. Did we get something? What's that? Is that a person? A person? That's him. That's my brother. I'm so sorry for your loss. Hey... What is that? What do we do? Miss Morita. Your brother's remains... It was discovered in an unbelievable state. We don't know how to handle it. Stop! Stop! No! Don't open it. We're counting on you on that baby. My... Baby... I'm glad we got to put her with Grandma's grave. But I'm sure she's happy to be back with her parents. Grandpa... Huh? Did you believe what I said? Grandpa! Yes? Grandma is smiling too. Huh? Right. Thank you, Doctor Morita. Thank you for everything. Ryotaro is a perceptive boy. If something strange happens all of a sudden... Please don't deny him. Listen to his thoughts. We will. See you. Mama told me to tell your friend thank you. Friend? Your mother told me that? She was a single mother with no relatives to turn to. Goodbye. - If you'll excuse us. - Okay, let's go. Ryo-chan? It's like there are people from Inunaki Village who have no one to turn to. Ryotaro is not our real child.
