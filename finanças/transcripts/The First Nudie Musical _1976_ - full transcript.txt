[dramatic orchestral music] [wind blowing] [men chattering] - [Man] Come on Harry. [men talking over each other] - All right, all right, all right, all right. So it's not Gone with the Wind, but for 60,000 bucks, what do you want? - A hit? - Oh, you're cute Benny, you're real cute. - Hey Harry, they're tired of cheerleaders. They're tired of nurses. Now if we're gonna keep making these things, we need a new gimmick, something fresh. - [Benny] That's right. - Hey, we're hardly breaking even. This is bird doody compared to what we could be making. - [Benny] That's right. - [Man] Hey, maybe the bloom's off the rose with porno, Harry. Maybe we ought to get into commodities. - [Benny] That's right. - Look, what's the matter with you guys? I made you guys a lot of money. All right, so the last picture didn't do too well. The last couple weren't huge hits, but come on. I got some great ideas, some great ideas. - Yeah well, come on, let's hear some of them. - Well, they're great ideas. [men mumbling] [coughing] - Come on, Harry. Let's end this misery. Just sell us the studio. With all this acreage, we could put up a beautiful shopping center. We'd be much better off, right? - Shopping center? Come on, look, I told you guys a million times, as long as my father is alive I'm not selling this studio. What, do you want me to kill him? It'd kill him if he knew I was making porno. He still thinks I'm making the kind of pictures he made. I mean, look at that old man. Look, he built this studio from nothing. He poured his guts into it. All right, so he wasn't Fox. He wasn't Warner, hell he wasn't even Republic, but he kept this studio alive and I'm not selling him out. - Well, then tell us an idea already. - Look, Harry, we have done every kind of filth there is. Everything, you name it. Nothing. - Let's do one about a deer. Call it, Anything for a Buck, A Stag Film. [laughing] I'll just go sit at my desk. - Look, you're in big trouble, Harry. And all she can do is make jokes. - Oh no, I can dance too. Great, huh? [soft music] Well, not in these shoes. I have tap shoes. - She just danced in here. I don't believe it. She came in, and she told a joke, and she danced. I'm surprised she didn't sing, too. - I can sing. - [Man] Hey, we got business. - This is turkey doody. - Oh, come on, Harry. Let's stop putzing around, now give us an idea. - All right. You want an idea? I'll give you an idea. Ah Jesus Christ, what an idea! - Well, what is it? - You ready? - We're ready already. We are going to make the first porno musical. - We're what? - What the fuck are you talking about? A musical? A porno musical? - That's right, a musical. Look, think about it for a minute, huh? Look at all that hardcore crap. People don't need to go to the movies to see hard core. They want something new, like you said, something different. They don't want to see any more licking. They've seen enough licking pictures. Genitalia, it's boring. But singing genitalia? Oh, gentlemen. Come on. [guys moaning] - Of course, you don't know. Nobody knows, but I'm telling you, this can revolutionize the business. - Nah, it's never been done. - Of course it's never been done. Have a little vision, vision and foresight. What, do you think those schmucks uptown just said, let have color, let's have sound, let's have cinema scope? No, no, somebody had a vision, and the rest of the jerks just got on the bandwagon, huh? Look, Eddie. We can make film history. We can be millionaires. - Yeah, I know. But can we make any money? - Can we make any money? Look, this isn't hype gentlemen, this is the real thing.

[laughing] He couldn't come. - Yeah. Well it's John, isn't it? - What is? - Your name? - It's John. - Wonderful. Now, John, as you know, your Uncle Benny got you this job, and as you know, and as I know, you've never directed a picture before, but that's okay, that's okay. He says you're willing to learn. Right? - Right. - Right. I really didn't know you were this young. - Oh, I just look young. I'm really 23. - 23? Now look, John. I don't know if your Uncle Benny told you about the kind of picture we're making. - He said it was a musical. - Yeah, well it is a musical, but it's not an ordinary musical, it's a tits and ass musical. - Tits and ass? - A pornographic musical. - A pornograph? [laughing] - Look John, I know you have a wealth of sexual experience, and a panorama of sexual knowledge, but to be honest on the outside, you look innocent, you know like you don't know your ass from your elbow. - Oh, I know I give the appearance of being very innocent but I really do have a wealth of sexual experience and a panorama of knowledge. - Fine. But we only have two weeks to make this picture. Now, tomorrow you're gonna be meeting the cast. Now most of them are veterans. - Is Chill Wills in it, Andy Devine? - No, no, no, John, a veterans of many porno films. So when you go in there tomorrow, you gotta act like you know what you're talking about. You gotta be gutsy, you gotta use filthy language. Otherwise they're gonna walk all over you. Now, this picture has everything, John, we got your, tits, ass, fucking, fondling, oral sex. You don't have anything against oral sex, do you, John? - No, I like to talk about sex as much as the next fellow. - Oh boy, are we in trouble. - Why? - Listen, like I said, we both know you're a dean on sexual matters, but when you go in there tomorrow, you gotta act like you know what you're doing. You gotta pretend to know how to make a picture, huh? You gotta, you gotta be strong. You gotta let them know who's boss. Now go home, go home, read, do research. See Deep Throat, I don't know. - Deep what? - Deep Throat. Look. - Where is that playing? - I know we're gonna be pals, John. And it's just gonna be great.

Do you think we could arrange that? - Well honey, we do have a dressing room, but it's not real close to the set. - Oh, that's quite all right. Where exactly is it? - New York. - Now, do you have all the information? - Yeah. - Okay, you got this stuff here?

Okay? - I'll try Mister Schechner. - It's Schechter. - Schechter. - Okay. First, I'd like to welcome you all and say how happy I am to have you in the picture. You all know what kind of a movie we're making. And we have hardly any time at all to shoot this picture, but if we all work together, I know we can pull it off. We, that is to say are very fortunate to have a very talented director. And I know he wants to say a few words. I'd like you all to meet John Smithee. [group applauding] Talk. - Hello. My name is J... John Smithee, and I will be directing this film. We will, of course shoot it at the ratio of 1.85 to 1, using a camera. Fuck. It will of course be montages, flash cuts, fade outs, add-ins, an occasional pan, always of course, using the camera. Eisenstein and I work very much the same way, and he, of course, continues to make great moneymaking pictures. - Oh, please God, why me? - Now, as Mister Sheckler said, we don't have a lot of time. So I will, of course expect hard work, cooperation, diligence, photography, sound, and color. Shit, we can make a fucking good bitch of a bastard movie, if we all pull together and work as a whore-loving cunt penis team. Thank you. [laughing] - All right, all right, everyone. Take five, take five, and then we'll get to work. - How was I? - You were wonderful John, you were just wonderful. - Marvelous. - I was? - Oh, yes yes.

I think that's what Harry's trying to say. Only Harry's having a seizure at the moment. - Right. Then what I'll do is I'll start rehearsing and I'll get the number, right. - All right, let's get this rehearsal, all right, now this is the dildo number. Every dildo works, all right? - Okay, okay, everybody. Dildos. Mary, let's go. - It's Miss La Rue to you, bozo. Hello Harry. - I got dibs on the crane for rehearsal. - Dibs on the crane? - How's it going, Harry. - Oh, great, great. - Hey listen, can I see you for a minute? - Yeah, what's up? - Benny is very upset about the script. Guy's come up with some great jokes and he thinks they'll really help the picture. He wants you to come over and hear 'em. - Jokes, what is he talking about, jokes? He wants jokes? Tell him to come down here, I'll put him in the picture. - That's just it, Harry. If you don't go see him, he will come down here. - All right, all right. I'll give him five minutes, all right. Just wait here, okay? Look Rosie, you gotta help me out here. This is an incredibly important number. So stay here, watch everything. Make sure you handle it, okay? I love you, I love you. Okay, come on Eddie. Let's get out of here. - Okay, everybody. This is a full rehearsal. Everything works. - Lights, cameras, action. - Take him up. Music, Dick. And action, Mary. Oh belles.

I will not do the scene until these damn dildos know their steps. I am an actress. I've studied with Strasberg, and I don't need this shit. I'm going to my dressing room. - John? - Yes. - John, I think we need another rehearsal. You'd better go and talk to Mary and see what you can do. You. - I? - You are the director.

Now what's this, huh? - Harry, I'm so glad you came to talk to me. I don't like any of the other people on this picture. - That's okay, they don't like you either. Now listen, sweetheart. I got a picture to make here. I can't replace you, you're in too much footage already. And then you throwing me way behind schedule. And I was behind schedule even before there was a schedule, so stop jerking around, okay? - Well, that does put us in a bit of a predicament, doesn't it? Kiss me, Harry. I said, kiss me, Harry, then I'll do the scene. - Oh shit. [clapping] - Real cute Harry. You ought to be in the picture. - Look, now get in there and do this scene, okay? - Anything you say, Harry. Not his type of woman, huh? Tough titty, isn't it? - That's what I've heard. - Ooh, real cute honey. - Thanks, honey. - She's blackmailing me, do you believe it? - No. - [Man] Perversion, take one. - Hello, all you wonderful perverts.

Now in the scene, you know, I, I wouldn't wear the dark glasses or the hat because, in the scene you're supposed to be a, you know, making love. - I'm not here for making love. I'm here for fucking. I do this eight hours a day. [laughing] - Now in this scene. - He knows what to do, dipshit. - Oh, very well. Shall we get a rehearsal? - Rehearsal? Just roll the goddamn camera. - Fine, lights, cameras. - Knock it off. Action. - [Man] Cock inserts, take one. [Mary moaning] - You say you're always like this. - Always. Something about my body chemistry. I have a perpetual erection. [Mary moaning] - [Man] We ran out of film, cut. - John, you ran out of film. [Mary still moaning] - Cut. [Mary moaning] [coughing] Cut. Why disturb them? We'll tell them later. - See ya. - God, wouldn't you love to have somebody like him? God, I sure would. - He was just so big. He was just so big. - Yeah, well you got someone better, right? - Oh right. But he was just so big. It was just so big. [funky music] - Well, it's not bad, not bad. But we're so far behind. We only have two days left, and that dumb kid just keeps hanging around. - Why don't you send him on some more errands? - Where can I send him? We got 8 million donuts piled up in the back of the stage. I got it. - What? - We'll send him for script changes. - Script changes? - To Wanda's. - Wanda. John? [laughing] - Wanda, oh Wanda? Wanda?

Schechter not Schechner. [mumbling] [tingling music] I've got it. Goddamn it, I've got it. - I'll go back to the House of Pies [indistinct]. I still have that outfit. I ended up. [phone ringing] Hello? - [Harry] I got it, Rosie I got it. - Well, I didn't give it to you. [phone ringing] - Harry? I'm sorry, I was still asleep. What is it? - Look Rosie, I figured out what's gonna save us. I figured out who's gonna do the number. - [Rosie] You did, great, who? - Three guesses. - Harry, it's 3:30 in the morning. Don't play three guesses with a person at 3:30 in the morning. Who's gonna do the number? - You. - Harry, you must be having a very bad dream. Go back to sleep. - Oh no, no, no dream. Now look, come on. You've seen the routine a hundred times. I've seen you tap dance, I know you can do it. Come on, if you don't do the number, you're gonna make my father a very unhappy man. And at 85, he doesn't need the aggravation. Now, come on, there's no pressure. Just take your time. Okay, times up Rosie. - Harry, I can't, really. - Please, please, please, Rosie for me. - You got it. Gee, I'm glad there was no pressure. - [Harry] Rosie, I love you. - I love you too, Harry. - Okay, all right, now go back to sleep, I'm gonna call George and tell him you're doing the number with him. Okay, bye. - Bye. Oh shit. - Thanks a lot, Jay. See you later. - God, 5:00 a.m. Hi there, what are you doing out this late all alone? My name is George, George Brennan. - Give me your money. - My, you have a deep voice. Didn't even tell me your name, ya creep. I don't believe it, mugged in front of my own building. All right. - Mugged in front of his own building. I don't believe it, if it's not one thing, it's another. How the hell can you make a picture around here. - Stop pacing. His eye can't be all that bad. - George? All the makeup in the world isn't going to cover that thing. About the only good thing that's happened is that John hasn't showed up. - Maybe he's still at Wanda's. - All night? - Hi girls, how are you? That's a nice set of knockers you got there. Beep beep. Well, what are we all standing around for, huh? What are we gonna do today, another fuck scene? [laughing] Well, God let's get started before that fart Harry gets down here. [laughing] - What did you say, John? [laughing] - Mister Schechter. I'm sorry I'm late. That place you sent me to, that was some place. I want to thank you. - You're welcome. - Heard about your problem, Harry. What's happening? - Well, it looks like we can't finish the picture, so you tell me what's happening. - Well, Benny and the boys and me have decided, according to the terms of our contract, well, you know, we're taking over the studio. - Well, we almost made it didn't we? I want to thank you all very much. You'll be working for your Uncle Benny now, John. - Wait a minute, I don't want to work for my Uncle Benny. I hate my Uncle Benny. My uncle Benny is a shit hook for doing this. I can't do this picture without you here. - Well John, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, But thanks. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, Mister Schechter, I have an idea. I have an idea. - Hey John boy, I think your Uncle Benny wants to see you. And I mean, now. - Mister Schechter, you can do the number. - What, are you nuts? - You know the routines better than anyone. - He's right Harry, you know the routine. - You're nuts. Oh, I'm nuts, and I'm doing the number. So unless you're nuts and you do the number, You're gonna lose the studio, Harry. - Rosie. You got yourself, a new costar. [crowd cheering] - Look Mister Schechter, I don't want you to worry about a thing, because with my direction, you won't have to worry. I'll take care of you. - John boy, are we really gonna need donuts today? Go on. - Right. - Sorry Eddie, for this number, it's gonna be a closed set. Now listen, everybody. We gotta pull together here and be like a family. George, I'm gonna need your help. I gotta brush up on the steps. All right, everyone, let's go! - Good evening, Mister and Missus America, Navy Morgan in Hollywoodland, USA.
