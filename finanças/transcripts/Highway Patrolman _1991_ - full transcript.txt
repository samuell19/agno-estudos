HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Rojas, come here at once! I haven't got all day! What classes do you have today? Law, self-defence, criminal psychology, weaponry. This letter authorises you to work for me. Show it to your tutors tomorrow. Sir, this will affect my marks. Report to my office in 15 minutes. Guerrero, come here at once! Come with me. Cadet, help the ladies. Open the door. But I was right there. You were lucky I had to cut the grass and wash the car I found condoms in the glove compartment. - You're having me on. - I swear it's true. - Sorry, Sergeant. A tyre burst. - You'll pay for a new one. Two volunteers to change the wheel. Guerrero and Leyva! Who can give me the essence of today's lesson? You're the most stupid class I've ever had! Let's see if Cadet Rojas can enlighten his illustrious colleagues. Three reasons to stop vehicles: One, highway patrol violations. Two, mechanical defects. - Three- - Stop thrashing about, Rojas. What is the essence of today's lesson? Well, it seems that whatever the circumstances they've always broken the law. Exactly! They've always broken the law. When you follow a vehicle stop it first, then decide what they have done. - What have you learnt today? - They've always broken the law! Your rifle. Your pistol. Your badge. Cadet Pedro Rojas! The National Highway Patrol... expects you to honour it, and maintain the spirit of the service. Cake, Isabel? I hope you like it. Congratulations, brother. Where's Dad? You know he's tied up with work. You're lucky to have passed I'd have failed if it wasn't for Pedro. Don't tell anyone. Mother, Dad hasn't spoken to me in a year! Don't be upset. He wanted you to study medicine. You're the first to have finished his studies. No matter what Dad thinks, I'm proud of my brother the patrolman. Your first assignment is Sector Four of the Northern Zone, Highway 82. You've been highly recommended. I expect an exemplary performance. Report to Lieutenant Perez. He will allocate a car to you. You get number 27, Rojas. Our best car, because they say you are a good driver. Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm warning you, one scratch and I'll knock the shit out of you. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Lieutenant. May I see your licence? You're putting lives at risk, driving the wrong way down a one-way street. What is your explanation? I'm late for work and my boss wants to fire me. My mother is ill, my father beats me and my dog has died. You should leave earlier to get to work on time. I could impound your car for three days. Here is your licence. I'll overlook it this time. Everything is all right. Right? Have a nice day. Buy our iguanas! Pedro, they've assigned us to look after hell. Even buzzards are at a loss here. - What would you like? - Ice cold beers. The beers have all gone, lads. There is only tequila. - What about those gringos? - They brought their own beer. No beer. Bring tequila then. What do you reckon? Beer. No, thank you. German, the best Mexican beer is best. You've never been to an Oktoberfest... Can't you see we're busy? I'll leave them there. How do they expect us to make money here? Meet our quotas. Check trucks and permits. Dealers smuggle drugs in truckloads of explosives. Don't mess with them, they're really dangerous. We mustn't be afraid of them. It's poison! - What's wrong? - No front bumper. It was stolen last night. - Open the back. - I've nothing but canned goods. Nothing but canned goods? Take this ball. Shoes for your son. A bathing suit I'm impounding this merchandise. Follow me to the police station. I'm only making a living. Thanks for remembering my children. Getting permission was difficult. God will know how to thank you. It takes so little to make them happy, doesn't it? May I have a cigarette? SONS OF THE ARMY Come to our restaurant, El Familiar. Try our delicious chilaquiles in green sauce, and our succulent huevos rancheros. If you're so weary, stay at home instead of sucking travellers' blood. Article 70 - trucks are not public transport. Licence, please. How am I supposed to take my workers to the fields? In a limousine? It's obvious that you come from the city. Leave him alone, Señorita Griselda. - Griselda... - Don't you like my name? It's unusual, but I like it. What now? Because I am not going to give you money. You'll breakfast with your workers. I've not eaten since yesterday. You want to have breakfast? Do you know Pancho Villa Street? Do you know where the plaza is? My house is two blocks from the plaza. Number 115 I'll be waiting there... in an hour. Don't be late. Is Señorita Griselda in? We've been waiting for you. You are two hours late. Lots of work? Highway problems, Señor Marcos. Never mind. You can come here whenever you like. Why haven't the service station robbers been caught yet? That's a matter for the municipal police, not us. Well consider this your home. Please help me with my sleeve. I hope I won't make it worse. What happened to your face? When I was a boy, some friends threw me through a window. With such friends, I'd hate to meet your enemies. Life in the capital, Señorita Griselda. How do you like it in Mapimi? It's lovely. They say that God was born in Mapimi. - An egg? - Yes please, Señorita Griselda. All my friends call me Zeldita. You're dead tired. Zanaida, prepare the guest room for the officer. It's not necessary, Señor Marcos. Patrolmen never rest. Always looking down the barrel of a gun. - True? - True, Zeldita. Father, weren't you going to do something? No, I've got no plans. You asked me to remind you of something. Oh yes I was going to change the flowers on your mother's grave I'll come to the door with you. - What about Father? - He's very tired and his leg hurts. Tell him I miss him very much. Let's get going, my love. I need money for irrigating the ranch. A patrolman's salary isn't big enough for that. Open the door for me. I know how to do it. - Put it on the floor. - OK. You know a patrolman's salary is barely enough to get by on. Somehow we must have more money here. Don't drool on me. Don't worry, all women are the same. She'll get over it. A wedding ring is a tightening noose I just washed it. It's dirty here. - How goes it, Anibal? - A promise is a debt. - How much? - Half. And check the oil in my car. What are you doing? Get rid of that banger. It's fine. I just need to change the plugs. - Change the car. - The car's fine. Rojas. Report to the Commandant. What have you done? Who knows. You're worn out. Come for some fun at the Oasis after your shift. No. Thanks all the same, Anibal. What's happening, Rojas? I hear you aren't fulfilling your quota for tickets. Is there a problem? The road is deserted. There's almost no traffic. Officer Guerrero seems to have no problem - I'm not interested in him. - But I am, Rojas! Because of your poor performance I am assigning you to Route 44. - The pig route? - Precisely. If you don't manage to fulfil your duties there I'll have to suspend you. Understand? - Yes, sir. - Dismissed. I think one is dead. Did you ask for the permits? He has the vet's examination papers but no health permits I'll check. Confiscate the dead pig. Sorry, but without health permits I can't allow you to go any further. All the Health Department red tape... The pigs will die of old age before I get permits I have Doctor Matanzas' certificate, and a donation to your department's retirement fund. We appreciate your donation. But you can't leave without permits. Every time they change the officer, the bribe goes up. I'm not informed about that I'll inform you. There you are. Please stamp my permit. Even stones bleed out here, don't they? - What's this? - The dead pig. They're not going to eat it! The poor people haven't got much else. What are you drinking? I'll pay. Looking for company? I'm married. Everyone here is married. Buy us a drink. Waiter! A round of drinks for the ladies. Not like that. Dance slowly. Come on. Get up and go. Time's up. - Out, Pepe. - Pedro... Pedro Rojas. Come and see me soon, Pedro. I like you. Officer Pedro Rojas. Emilio. Are you paying a visit? - What time do you call this? - It's only five in the morning. Don't try to be funny, you fool. Where have you been? Don't yell, you'll wake your father. Since when have you cared? I'll do what I please in my house. We'll see about that. No one makes a fool of me I'm warning you, Pedro. It's my house, and no one makes a fool of me I'm warning you, Pedro! Just you wait and see. Where have you been, Pedro? I'm talking to you. If you do this again you won't live to see another day, I swear it. And if you give me a venereal disease I'll serve your balls for breakfast. You're making money at last, Pedro dear. You should have said you were working. Come on. We must get there first. Car 27, reporting from the accident on Highway 27. There's another one inside. - How goes it, Anibal? - Fine. It's a good job we got here first. Those vultures never leave a thing. How about this? Nice, eh? It's for you to keep, Pedro. I'm going after them. Car 27 reporting a suspicious yellow Gremlin without number plates. Stop immediately! Take it easy, boss. We don't want to end up full of holes. You're drunk. Get out of the car! Hold on, calm down. Don't muck about with me. Show me your licence! Take it easy, just give me a moment. Don't upset me. Give us a ticket quickly. We're in a hurry. Simon, show him your licence. Goodbye, copper! Car 27, Code 44 I've been shot in the leg. Car 27, Officer Rojas, report your position. Pedro. Wake up, man. I must speak to you, boy. - Father? - Yes. Don't you recognise me? Dad, I'm happy to see you. Those men almost killed you. I wasn't careful enough. It won't happen again. You'll end up crippled, like me. All because of those damn cops who blew my knee off in the 1962 strike I'll be all right, you'll see. Reconsider all this, son. Come and work with me. Is that why you came? You almost lost your life. Don't keep disobeying me! Father, I'm a patrolman and I always will be. After this you insist on remaining a petty taker of bribes? Please don't treat me like this. We'll meet again, Pedro. In another life. Father, don't leave me here. Help me! When you grow up, you'll work like Daddy, Lucerito Pedro, please. Don't start giving her ideas. So being a patrolman means nothing? Don't get upset. You know your public service work gets very little recognition. Dad came to insult me, too. Your father? Your father has died. While you were in hospital. You had such a fever. We couldn't break the news to you. I'll put the baby to bed. Eat. What did they do to you? Don't touch me there. It hurts like hell. It's a dangerous job, isn't it? Your job is dangerous too. Maribel? Why do you do this? What do you mean "why"? Why are you a cop? You can't compare jobs. No? What do you know? I have two children. My husband left me two years ago. Do you think I do it for fun? No, not that. Get the hell out of here I never want to see you again. Maribel, I didn't mean to offend you. Fuck off! I don't want to see you. Damn leg! Are you all right? What happened? - I hit a truck. - You were chasing it? No, I shifted to first instead of reverse. Well you did a thorough job. Do you think it's funny? This vehicle is public property and you are responsible for it. You must pay for the repairs. In the meantime, use this car. No objections or you'll keep it. Pull over! That's an order! - Let's see how brave you are now. - Don't kill me! Why should I stain my hands with your blood? Your cellmates can rape you I'm Ramon Lopez Perez, son of the state governor. - Bullshit! I'll knock that out of you. - I swear! I'm Ramon Lopez Perez! I'm taking you in. Your friends can wait for the pick-up truck Eliseo, call my father at the mansion I'll call my uncle at the police too. - Why not call the President? - I know him, too. I swear I'm Ramon Lopez Perez. My uncle will fix that creep. Stop crying, sissy. You're all right. You've really screwed things up, Pedro. First you crash your car. Then you rough up the Governor's son. He deserved a bigger beating than he got. Sure, but you know these little rich boys. They're made of porcelain. You can't touch them. Daddy is someone. - It was a misunderstanding. - Control your animals. Don't you insult me! Navarro, sort this creep out. - Just try that again! - Clear off, you brat! Rojas, come to my office. Never draw a gun on a minor. It's the first thing we teach you! So what happened? I'm on report. I must go and see Doctor Bolaños in Torreon. Rojas, car 27 is ready. Assign it to someone else. I've got used to 112. You're joking. This car is a death-trap. No. The 112 engine is more powerful Pedro, take 27. It's a better car. Like this gun, it's better Smith and Wesson automatic. You can't compare it to your gun. What's the difference? They both kill. Are you sure you didn't hate your father? He was very strict but I loved him. And you still like women? Absolutely. Doctor, be frank. Do you think there is something wrong with me? Officer Rojas, take these pills. If they don't work I'll prescribe stronger ones. Señor Peña, your bus is in no condition to be driven. Give us a break. We're not going far. Think of the kids. They're all mentally retarded. Besides I was going to give you a big tip. It's not a question of money. You're responsible for the children's safety. Car 19, this is 112. Over. White caravan, licence 471 OVE, coming your way. Driver was smoking a joint. We'll collect off them. Thanks, Pedro! Be careful, they look like smugglers. Keep radio contact. I'll join you. There's a campsite up there. It's for girls but I'm sure they'll admit you. God bless you, Officer. You're kind. Have a drink on me. Drive carefully, Señor Peña. What are you looking at? Get inside. Car 19, I've spotted them. I'm moving to intercept. Car 19. I'm behind the white caravan. There's no danger, I'm stopping him. Calling car 19, 112 won't start. Relax, Pedro. Fix it and then follow. I've switched on my warning lights. Don't do it, Anibal. Wait for me. They've shot out my windscreen! Those bastards won't get away! Anibal, back off! They're armed to the teeth! They're getting away! Now they've stopped. Where the hell are you, Pedro? Take cover. I'm almost with you. I can't hear you, Anibal! Speak clearly, I can't hear you! Where are you, brother? Hold on! What happened to you? What have they done to you? Where was God when they did this to you? What would you like, gentlemen? A bottle of tequila. I'm sorry, we serve only cocktails Tequila, or I'll knock the shit out of you! Sorry. We've just come from a funeral. Please make an exception in this case. Thirty years in the service... and I can't get used to this. To Anibal, Pedro. We must never forget him. I'm going to look for those gringos. They're going to pay. Don't waste your time. They're out of the country by now. Learn from what happened and forget the whole thing. But be sure to remember your friend Anibal who died doing his duty. The White House has stated that drug smuggling from Mexico is up 30%. Turn off that television! And bring another bottle of tequila. And another glass. Salud, Sergeant. Buy our iguanas! Why aren't you at school? We don't want to go. Don't you know it's illegal to sell iguanas on the highway? - Where did you get them? - The mountains. You don't want to go to prison? Tell me where your school is then. It's up there. You don't want to go? Well I'm taking you up there right now. Take your hands off the car. You think it's funny? Officer, we have a big problem. A rabid dog, over in the corral. - What happened to her? - The dog bit her. Take her to the clinic at once! Don't follow me, it might be dangerous. You have a problem, too? It's my daughter, these children's mother. As long as it's not another dog. You must pay for killing my chicken. You fool. Can you take my grandson? They left my daughter here this afternoon. - Maribel? - Do you know her? Then help her. She can't stay here. Maribel, what's wrong with you? It's Pedro. Don't you recognise me? Maribel, what did they do to you? I'm all right, don't worry. - I'm freezing. - Put my coat on. - Put that animal away. - It's only an iguana, Pedro. Careful, there's another somewhere. Don't be a sissy I'll take you to the bar but you must tell me who is giving you the drugs. - What's it to you? - I'm not mucking about. Me neither. Stop acting like Tarzan's mother. You can't change things. - What are they for? - Pills. For my nerves. Let me help you. Keep out of my problems. Let me buy you something to eat at least. - If you like. - Two portions of chicharrón. Come and see me sometime Emilio, listen. I need some now. Emilio, I'm dying. Let's go inside. - Who was that cop? - A customer, like all the others. Car 27, report your position. Can you tell me the time? Come on, can't you afford a watch? It's very late. Pedro, breakfast is ready. What are you doing? I'm just checking Anibal's gun. You can't forget, can you? I couldn't save his life. Be careful, that's all I ask. I'm your wife. But I don't want to be your widow. Get out, with your hands up! Where are you going? I'm taking my brother to work in Nuevo Laredo tomorrow. - What's your job? - I'm a journalist... - Show me your press card. - It's at home in Brownsville. Journalist? Don't you mean smuggler? - Open the boot. - I haven't got the key. You travel light. Maybe your heavy bags are elsewhere? On your knees, you bastard! Drop your trousers. Why? This is abuse by the police. What have we got here? Where did you get this stuff? They'll kill us if we squeal. That's not my problem. What about the helicopter beyond the mountains? It's the distributors, foreigners. We take their drugs across for them. - When are they due back? - In two days, stuff for Los Organos. Please don't kill me. For my children's sake. We haven't done anything. Clear off. The car? - Can I come in? - Yes. Finished? A few moments ago. Want to cover yourself? Don't you like me like this? Take this money. And the drugs. Go and dry out at your mother's. Who are you to order me about? A patrolman. Obey me or go to jail. Pedro, there is no cure for me. I am going to die. Then die at home I don't want to find you dead in this crappy place. Hold me. Pack and I'll take you to the bus. Hug your mother and the kids for me. Tell me if you need anything. Call me through HQ when you get home. Enough of that, we're off now. Rojas, we're out of work. You haven't wrecked your car in months. Check the points while I see the Commandant. I've received a report from the police. They stopped two men on the highway. They said a patrolman confiscated their drugs then let them go. Do you know anything about this? The police are very naive I'm sure it's just a yarn. The drugs have been hidden. - You don't know anything? - Absolutely nothing I'll tell them to make further enquiries. You may go now. Be careful, lad. I'll be keeping a close eye on you. Understand? Emilio! It's Pedro Rojas of the PNDC. All I want to know is who the guys in the helicopter were. Come and get me, if you can! Emilio, I'm Maribel's friend. Let's drop our guns and make a deal. Just come and get me! I only wanted to talk to you, that's all. Fuck! I'll tell him at once. Central Office congratulates you, Rojas. He was a drug trafficker. He deserved it. - I only wanted to detain him. - That you did. Congratulations. However, I must suspend you for 30 days during the investigation. Why? It's routine, when there's been a death. The police insist that weekly deliveries were 15 kilos. They accuse me of concealing the drugs? You know how they are. They suspect everybody. I'm resigning, Commandant. The Highway Patrol rewards its most effective personnel, Rojas. We must be tough. You have a great future in the Corporation I don't give a damn. I'm going home. Stupid little boys. Most don't even make it this far. - What's wrong with the baby? - Who knows, Dad. Don't forget to tell Venancio to repair the cow pasture fence. Drive carefully. Don't hurt the boys. Buy me the afternoon edition of "The Voice of the North". And don't forget my change. - Is that all? - No. My kiss. What's so funny? What a nice surprise. Maribel, you have a visitor. Pedro, I'm surprised to see you I couldn't come before, what with quitting the service and everything I can imagine. I went to Headquarters a month ago. Invite the officer for a cup of tea. We'd invite you to eat but there isn't enough. I'm glad to see you looking well. But for how long? Pedro, live with us. We'll be very happy. No, I can't leave my family, my daughter. So I'll have to go back to the bar. No, please don't. How am I supposed to feed my family? You promised to give me money, or have you forgotten? If you don't want to live here and I can't work... What then? What the hell am I supposed to do? Are you going to support me or what? Yes. I'll give you money every month. Thanks, Pedro. You're great. Maribel, the child! Buy our iguanas!
