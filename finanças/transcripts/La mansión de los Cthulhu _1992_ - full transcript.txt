We are now on a long journey. A journey of no return. A journey into the shadows of the unknown. The dark side of life. Into unknown dimensions. Our guide on this journey into the mysteries beyond is Lenore, capable of seeing what no one has ever seen. Her supernatural powers shall guide us. Lenore, Lenore, you are now entering the world beyond. Tell us. Tell us what do you see. I see a beautiful white light. I want to go towards the light. It's so beautiful. I feel it drawing me to... Help. Help. Chandu, help. Free yourself. Go towards the light. Go towards the light. Do not be afraid. Go towards the light. Man, I've saw a lot of shit in my time, Hawk, but this is the weirdest place I ever moved though. Yeah and so far all you've done is jerk me off, Eddie. Mellow out, man. Don't forget, it ain't yours. I just like to sell it to you. So, be nice. - You want nice? Join the fuckin' Girl Scouts. Can you show me the snow or I blow. You dig? Hey. Hey, give me that back. You don't need both of 'em, babe. Trust me. You're getting piggy. How many times have I told you, Billy? You gotta open your mouth first. What is taking Hawk so long? Well, maybe he's laying one of the vampires. Hey, Hawk told us to hang here. You know something? I'm getting tired of her treating me like I'm stir fried in shit. It's clean, but- But nothing. The snow is killer and you know it. Now, how much you want, con man? All Of it. "All of it" the man says. This shit's worth over 10 grand on street, man. Where are you and your little riffraff hoodlums gonna score green like that, huh? From switchblade bank, asshole. And here's the first payment. Hawk, what is going on? Where's Eddie? I told you to stay with Billy. What did you do? Fucker pulled a knife on me. What did you do? Nothin'! We're getting outta here. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce my charming, my beautiful assistant, Lisa. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I must ask for absolute silence during this extremely dangerous performance. Get out. Let me guess, you accidentally lost your keys? Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause that's what the last guy said that I caught jacking a car. But it's true, I swear. It's my old man's. Okay, son. Put your hands on the car. Spread your legs. Jeez, man, I knew you'd screw it up. Sorry, I, I couldn't get the car wired. No, dickhead, sorry is what you're gonna be if you don't hot wire a car like you bragged. Give him a break, Hawk. Look, Eva, if little bro here can't hack it, he can just crawl back to mama. Mama left a long time ago, remember? I'm his family, so quit riding him so goddamn hard. Come on, Hawk. I got the car running. Billy, get 'em. Shit, that's enough. Let's go! I don't think I can walk. Who asked you to think, asshole? I'll do the thinking around here. Through here. Shit. Pigs everywhere. Now what? Now we get Chris to a hospital. That would give us away for sure. And what are we gonna do, tell 'em he had a shaving accident? We can't just leave him here. Shit, we ought to. But since I know you'll bitch my ear off... Shut up or I'll really give you something to scream about. ♪ I'm a bad time and love that racket ♪ Been a long time We'll never make it outta here. Don't sweat it. I'll get us out. Well, they stabbed the poor guy three times. How'd you ﬁnd out? 'Cause after they stabbed him they threw him across the tracks and of course the alarm went off. Didn't you hear? Some guy got killed in the haunted house ride. And they think the ones that did are still in the park. Looks like Graham almost got 'em in the parking lot, but- They practically kicked his brains out. They just took him to the hospital in real bad shape. Anyway, tell Chandu it's gonna be slow getting outta the park tonight. We're gonna check everyday. Man, I'm gonna catch hell. My old lady'll never believe this one. Oh. Daddy? Yes, my dear? Well, I guess I did all right tonight all things considered. You were marvelous, marvelous, as if you'd never been away. Well, almost never. My costume fits a little tighter than it used to. What's wrong? Are you okay? - Oh, yes, I'm fine, fine. Just um, a little tired that's all. Something's wrong isn't it? No, no, what, whatever makes you ask that? Well, ever since I've been home I've had the feeling that you've been hiding something from me. Daddy, are you ill? Oh, no, no. No, it's just that well, I suppose my heart's not in this anymore. Come, come on, let's go. Come on. - See anything? - Not a goddamn thing. That-a way. You know, I've been thinking maybe I'd like to stay on for a few more weeks. Of course, my dear, of course you are more than welcome. You know that. What in heaven's name? Move and I blow her brains out. What is the meaning of this? Get in the car, old man. We're gonna take a little ride. What's the matter, Goldilocks? Come on, we don't have all night. Okay, okay. If you just play it real cool, my buddy here won't have to do a number on blondie's face. All right? Get goin'. Well, that seems to be the last car of the night. - What'd I tell ya? - Looks like we're outta luck. I told you I'm sure there's gonna be- Evening, Chandu. Sorry, but we gotta check all vehicles. Yes, I heard. No luck apprehending them? No, but they won't get far. We're blocking off all the roads. Looks like a heavy load tonight. Oh, the usual. A few magic tricks, um, an exhausted Lisa. That's incredible, but you know I quit smoking. See you Tuesday. Go ahead. So, that's it. Don't move! I'm smothering under this blanket. Come on, pull it off. I gotta get some air. Hey, I wanna see that cigar trick too. Shut the hell up. You try another trick like that, Pops, and you're history. Okay, now, listen good 'cause this is what we're gonna do. Where'd you say you lived? Hey, man, why do we wanna know where he lives? Hawk, Chris is bleeding real bad. Real bad. No, it's okay. I'm ﬁne. - You are not fine. Shut up. Just shut up! Okay, Popeye here is gonna take us to your house, and then we're gonna drop him off and then we're gonna take the car and split, okay? Now, does everybody know the plan here? All right, Popeye, where is your house? Are you deaf or something? He can't speak. Bummer. Home, James. Lisa. I'm okay. Hey, man, it's even better than I thought. Well, what are we waiting for? We're splitting, right? Look, Billy, didn't you hear the cops say all the roads were closed? Jesus. Come on, everybody out! Wow, check it out. It's like the Munster Mansion. Yeah, we'll save the tour for later. Where are we gonna put Chris? Through here. Hey, I'll take those. The car keys, too. Come on. Put him on here. Hawk, he's got a bullet in his leg. It's not just something that's gonna go away. You ain't calling shit unless I say. Well, say something then. What's the rest of your famous plan? If I take care of the boy's leg, would you then leave? Please, take my car, all the money I have, but you mustn't stay here. What does he know about fixing bullet wounds? What's the big deal? You swish a little alcohol in the hole, you tape it shut, it's ﬁxed. Yeah, then we take the wheels and we split. Man, you sound like a broken record. Okay, you're on. But if it doesn't work. Boom. - Felix, bring the first-aid box and some towels. Lisa, go get some water. Billy, go with Popeye here. Candy! Don't tell me. Keep my eyes on the girl, right? You know you're smarter than you look. Ooh. What's all this? Mm. I love tuna. You make a wicked sandwich. How can you live in a creepy place like this? Hey! What the hell? That wasn't too smart was it? Now, how about the water. Hawk, Goldilocks here tried a fast one in the kitchen, but I don't think she'll be trying it again, will ya? Hey! Hey, I thought we had a deal? Lisa, the alcohol. Hey, uh, I think I'm gonna check the rest of this place out. Hey, hold up, Billy. I'm with you. - Wait. - He's your brother, you stay and watch. Thanks for the support. Oh, better fix up the patient good, doc. 'Cause we're taking the big Barbie doll as medical insurance. Just in case he should die or something. It's like a goddamn museum. Holy shit. That's you only it's different somehow. My mother. Pretty hot stuff. Leonor Kowalski. Where's the old lady now? She's dead. Oh. So, where's the TV anyway? There isn't one. No TV? Forget the TV. The point is what are we gonna do with the coke? - Larry. - Yeah? I've got something for ya. Oh yeah? Well, it better be money 'cause your credit's run out. No, man, I wanna sell you something. Huh, sell me something? Yeah, I've got a quarter of some mighty fine blow. A quarter? How you and your band of losers get a hold of that? You want it or not? Well, bring it over and we'll see. No, no, man. This time I'm naming the place. Huh? Listen, man, if you wanna do business, you know where to find me, hm? Asshole! What did he say? He wants me to bring it to him. What are we waiting for? You loser. You are so dense. Fuck the road blocks man. Eddie's guys are gonna be looking for me everywhere. We'll just have to find another buyer I guess. How much you think we'll get for this stuff anyway? Well, I dunno, Bill. Maybe eight grand. Looks like more than eight grand to me. Ha, not after Eva gets her big schnoz into it. What's a lady gotta do to get a drink in this dive anyway? Hello? Earth to Goldilocks! I asked you a question. Behind the encyclopedia. Ooh, ain't that classy? I bet she uses $20 bills for wiping her ass too. What the hell? - What's this? Your old man's porno collection? Right. It's just trick mirrors and shit like that. Well, I think it's sick. Why would he do that to a poor kitty anyway? It's just a trick, babe. I Still think it's sick! My old man locked me in a trunk once and I almost died. The dark scares the shit outta me. What happened? Must be a fuse. Felix, go see to it. No way. You're not going anywhere. Please, I can't very well attend to your brother's leg by candlelight. Hawk. Where the hell are you goin'? What's this monkey trying to say? He's going down to the cellar to ﬁx the fuses. No, you're not. You go back in there. You hear me? Billy. You go fix the fuses. And you show him the way. When the cat's away, the mice can play. You little coke whore. Well, where's the fuses? Over there. How about a little toot? Nothin' doin'. Rule number one: you never get high on your own supply. I got a better idea anyway. I mean, like you and me, Hawk. We could like split tonight with the stuff when everyone else is asleep. You know what I mean? Miss Candy Cane, all ready for the lickin'. Oh, dammit! Let's see if it works now. Oh, Shit, What's that? Magic props. Your old man's one sick puppy to keep all this spooky shit around. Hey, we could have a good time down here. Our own little private party. Let's just go right back upstairs. Hey, we could have a real private party in here. No! What the hell do you guys keep down there? No! No, no! You know you're tougher than you look. I like that. - Leave me alone! No, help! Hey, what's the hold up? Lisa is in danger. I must go. Nobody's leaving this room. Keep him away from me. Problems in the basement, Bill? Hawk, we gotta get outta here, man. This place is haunted or somethin'. She turned into a skeleton right in front of me. Sounds like an improvement, Bill. So, are blondes more fun, you two timing asshole? I ain't making this shit up! Why the hell would I make up shit like this? What the hell is going on out here? Where are you going, grandpa? They boy's leg is bandaged. I've done as I said I would do. You must leave. So, how is your brother anyway? He's in bad shape. He should be in a hospital. You hear that? It's settled. Since we can't take him to a hospital, we're staying. I mean, you wouldn't throw a poor sick person out on a night like this would ya? Careful! I'm right here. - Lisa, are you all right? - Here, you'll be more comfortable like that. - Me? What about you? What have you been up to? Daddy, he opened that door. - I really am okay. - And I saw... - I just need to sleep it off. - Something. - You don't understand. Please forgive me. - I'm ﬁne, I know I am. Forgive you for what? What is going on? - Yeah, what's going on? Nothing, I... For god's sake, he was just asking if I was all right. If you're gonna scream, do it some place else. I'll take care of Chris. No, no, Miss Purity here is gonna stay and play nurse, Chandude and Popeye are comin‘ with us. I want to stay with Chris. I want you to come with me. Come on. No, you stay. Everybody out. I think we should get outta here. Don't think, Billy. Just tie him up. Okay, let's see what the old guy's got. All right, let's have his wallet. 150 measly bucks and no plastic. Do you believe this guy? Look, man, you said you were gonna give us all the dough you had. Ain't that right, Billy? Yeah, man, that's right. That is all I have. Then what do you call these? Hey, man, how obvious can you get? sixteen, eight, seven. It's nothing but hocus pocus shit. Hawk, I'm telling you, man. This is creepy shit.

I mean, Hawk's always been cool. He takes care of Eva and Eva's with Hawk and I'm with Eva. That's the way it's always been. But the drugs and tonight. It's getting outta hand. Well, I've gotta do something. You gonna help me? This is hot. When did you start wearing underwear? Just thought I'd check it out. It was a five finger discount. You gonna use some of that five finger stuff on me? Where do you think those come from? Yeah, right. You got Hawk a leather jacket. All I got was this. Honey, you know I love you in boxers. Yeah? Damn, you're bad. Hey, listen to this. Famous medium, Leonore Kowalski dies in a tragic fire. Her husband, Chandu, retires. Everybody's gotta go sometime. Anyway, who gives a shit? It's pretty weird anyway. Hey, Hawk. Look. Man, chicks are all the same. Hey. Hey! Eva, cut the shit. Give it to me. Are you fucking nuts? What's happening to me? Hey, hey, take it easy. It's gonna be all right. You, you have finally come to me. I had no choice. You've opened the door. Have you not learned? It was, it was the only way that I could reach you. No. Please, help me. Help Lisa. It is you who have endangered Lisa. You have served them perfectly, Chandu. And now, the evil congregates. Just waiting for the moment to invade with the vessels you have provided. With what, those young hoodlums? Don't you think they're evil? I have lured them here? Honestly, Lenore is there nothing, nothing you can do? I have tried, but there is too much evil present. I am overpowered here. Then what can I do? Seal the door, let it and me go. Save Lisa. But to save her you must accept your own fate, else she will be doomed with you as I was. Forgive me. Forgive me, please, Lenore. Please, please forgive me. It was not your fault. Chris? Chris! Help! What's going on here? I'm hungry. Ain't you had enough? I'm starving. Well, why don't you go downstairs and get yourself something to eat? Thanks for turning out those lights, babe. Ah, a cat. Boy, kitty, you sure scared the shit outta me. Where did you come from? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty. Now where the hell is she? Candy? Candy? Candy? Candy? Okay, Candy. Joke's over. Hey! Somebody! Open the door! Candy! Hawk! Help! God, help! Someone help, help! Help! Hawk! Somebody help me! - Fatman. - Surprised? Just stay where you are, kitten. Just came to pick up my coke. Hey, what coke, man? And pay you back for my friend, Eddie. Goddammit, Eva. But Hawk, I didn't pull the trigger. Lisa. Lisa, where are you? Chris? Oh, God! Somebody help me! Somebody! Looks like Fatman came alone. How the hell did he find us? Anyway, you seen Candy and Billy? I can't find 'em anywhere. Where did you stash the coke? Me? It ain't here and he doesn't have it. You're shitting me! It was Billy, fuck! Well, they gotta be here somewhere 'cause the car's still here. Look, I'm gonna go look for 'em. We gotta get our shit together because it is getting too weird around here. We are getting outta here now! Yeah, where to? Any fuckin' where but here! Come on. I'm not leaving without Chris. Oh, no you don't. Sit down! Shut your face. Eva? You okay? Yeah, I feel fine. When are we cutting out of here? Now. Can you walk? I don't know, but I can try. - Hawk, Chris is... - Forget Chris, man. Candy and Billy have pulled a disappearing act and the coke is no where in sight. I'll be back. I don't get it. I didn't think Billy would do this to me. Yeah, but Candy would. Shut up, just let me think! I know where they went. They went to Larry's. It's still weird they didn't take the car, huh? Yeah, well, she'd be dumb enough to sell dope hitchhiking. I'm going after 'em. You're staying here. Use that gun if you have to. Hawk. Come on. Get your first-aid shit together. You are gonna make a doctor's call. Move it! What have you done to my brother? That thing is not your brother. Can't you see that? Daddy, can't you do something. Don't you touch him. Okay, both of you downstairs! Where's Felix? We must get out of here. Turn that thing off. I did nothing. You're trying to freak me out, but you can't. I would've thought your brother's condition would be quite enough to, to freak you out as you say. Don't you understand we're in danger? This house holds great danger for all of us. We must leave! No, we have to wait for Hawk. What if he doesn't come back? Your brother is no longer your brother. Can't you see that? You're nuts. The both of you. Haven't you considered that your friend might have left you as a trick? To get rid of you and your brother. Shut up! You're just trying to fuck with my mind! He's coming back! I know it! Yes, no, yes, no, yes! He's coming back! Coming back! Make it stop! Make it stop or I'll kill you! Killing me will do no good. The house will still be here. There's no such thing as haunted houses. It's just a bunch of your lousy tricks. I'm not as powerful as you think. You're lying and it's gonna stop now. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! The gun is empty now. Give it to me please. We must leave at once. Come on now. Go with Lisa. Goodbye, Lenore. No! Hawk, Hawk? Hawk, Hawk, they said you weren't coming back. Hawk, weird things have been happening here. Plants were talking like people, and the house was shaking and Chris... I know, I know it's him and his goddamn magic! No, Hawk, this place is really haunted! No, I don't believe in this shit! Then you're doomed. We're all doomed if we stay in this house. Okay, Chandude. Let's see how powerful you really are. End of magic show. Get her outta here! Okay, talk. What the fuck did you do with Billy and Candy? Nothing. Okay, let's try this one. Where's the coke? What are you talking about? Can't you see what's going on here? All I'm gonna see is one real dead magician's bunny if you don't do some fast explaining. I'm getting out of here. Chris! Chris! Chris! It's not for you, princess. Hawk, Hawk? - Yeah? - Hey, man. I've been trying to call you for hours. Who the hell you been talking to? Fuck you! What the hell did you do with the coke? I sold it to Larry, man. I pulled off the deal of the century. We're rolling. To Larry? Hey, somebody here wants to talk to you. Yoo hoo, we are rich, babe. Candy, hey, listen. You tell Billy to get his ass over here right now! We're on our way. Why don't we just get him back upstairs, okay? I wanna get out of here now. Let's just take the car and go. I don't know where the fucking car is. I don't know where anything is. Anyway, that was Billy and they're coming to pick us up. So, just hang on okay? Listen, just hang on a little longer. It's gonna be okay. I promise. Chris, too? ls he gonna be all right? Yeah, yeah, Chris, too. Come on. Get some rest, okay? You need a beer. Get out, get out! Mr. Magic's not looking too hot. Daddy, please wake up. Please. I'm sick of this shit! What's happening? The door. Eva! Eva! Eva! Chris, Eva, where is she? The evil is real. May God have mercy on us. It's too late. Too late. Fuckin' lunatic! Lisa, you must try. You have the power. You must help me. Daddy, what are you talking about? I wanted to go beyond illusion. I wanted to see if magic really exists, but I was tampering with evil. And it knew so. I killed your mother. You didn't kill her. That was an accident. No, I was playing with a power beyond my control, but using her, she was the key. And in my greed for power, she was sacrificed. So, so that's what... Daddy, what have you done? I was haunted by her memory. I just had to reach her. I loved her so much. I wanted her forgiveness. But I have unleashed a madness beyond my control, and I can't stop it. Open, Goddammit! Lisa? Lisa? Let her go! It is me you have come for. Leave the world of the living. Return to the damned. Disappear from the light. Return to the shadows of hell. Daddy? Daddy? We gotta get out. No! Leave, Lisa. Leave. No! You must go before I harm you. - Daddy! - Come on! No, Daddy! Get down! We can't stay here. Let's go. Lisa! Don't look back. Come on. Lisa! Lisa!
