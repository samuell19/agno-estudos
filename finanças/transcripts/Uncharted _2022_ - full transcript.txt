Oh crap! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! That was purely reactive. Whoa! No! No! Come on! Nate! Come on. I got you. Help, I'm falling! I got you. Come on. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Keep it down. Hey, hey. What part of "wait for me" did you not get? - I said I'm coming with you. - Okay. Okay. We're looking for the Age of Explorers exhibit. So be quiet. Bubble Yum? That's my last piece. Let's split it. Hey. Punk. All right, smart guy. Who's this? Too easy. Ferdinand Magellan. First guy to sail around the world. Wrong. Magellan never made it all the way around. He just took all the credit. Holy shit. There it is. What? Come here. First map of the whole world. You know what Magellan was really looking for? Gold. But he never made it home. So all that gold, it's just gone? Whoa. Lost. Not gone. There's a difference. If something's lost... it can be found. But lucky for us, we got pirate blood in our veins. Descended from Sir Francis Drake himself. At least, that was what Mom and Dad used to say. You know, sometimes I think they're out there somewhere. Like they?re just lost. They're not lost. They're gone. All right. This map is worth a fortune. Here goes nothin'. Come on. Let's go. Hey. You two! Don't move. Oh, crap. We came here first out of respect. Sister B. But this is his third strike. Go get your things, Sam. You can't just let them take him away. Say your goodbyes. What the hell? I'm not letting them lock me up. No way. I'm coming with you. Not this time. Come here. You see me go anywhere without this? No. So you know I will never leave it behind. I will always be with you. It says Sic parvis magna. "Greatness from small beginnings." That's you and me. Let's go, kid. I better get going. I'll come back for you, Nate. Promise. Never forget, you're a Drake. I love you. Well, well, well, if it isn?t the late, great, and formerly employed Nate. At least you got the great part right. - Goldie, I brought your stuff up. - Thank you. - How was last night? - Great. - Yeah, he was cute? - Very cute. Nice. - Hey. - Hi Excuse me. Sorry. What can I get ya? - A vodka tonic. - Vodka tonic, come on. It's my first drink of the night. Test me a little. I don't know. A Negroni. A Ne-what? I'm kidding. The Negroni... First made in 1919 for Count Camillo Negroni when he swapped the soda water in his usual drink, the Americano, for gin Haven't seen you in here before. It's not really my neighborhood. Not your neighborhood? Where are you from? - Greenwich - Greenwich. Sounds nice. Bartenders up there don't give history lessons. Well, bartenders in Greenwich don't make Negronis like this. You wanna leave it open or closed? Open, probably. It's only Daddy's money. The cigarette... Invented by Alfonso Cigaretti in 1462. I'm kidding, I don't really know who invented the cigarette. You're kinda weird. But kinda cute, too. Then I'm kind of offended, but I'm also kind of flattered. Here. Come on. You know what? It's for the best. I've been trying to quit. Well, maybe it?s a sign. Or maybe you just need to get one that works. This old thing? Oh. it works. That trust fund ing?nue? She was the right mark. - Don't know what you're talking about. - Sure you do. You're going slow, playing it safe, not lifting too much at once. I mean, stop me if I'm wrong. Well, you're wrong. And we're also closed, so... Take off. Victor Sullivan. You can call me Sully. Thank you. I won't. But thank you. I got a job coming up. A big one. I need another set of hands on it. This is what you do? Stumble into bars, trying to pick up an accomplice? I'm offering you a real ticket out of here. A chance to see places you only read about in books. What do you say? You missed the read, Victor. I'm not a mark in some bar. And some of us here would really like to go home, so... Get out. Fair enough. Bye-bye, now. Hey, Goldie, let me get a beer. Sure. Son of a... Hey, get your head outta your... I'm so sorry, I didn?t see ya. Hey. I see patience ain't your virtue. Surprised to see me? Not even slightly. I made you a drink. Shirley Temple. That's hilarious. And the bracelet? It's in the first drawer there on my desk if you want it. But I think you're here 'cause you got bigger fish to fry. Nah, I'm just here for the bracelet. You done? No. This looks valuable. Now I'm done. Why the map? Of everything in here, that stopped you. Because it looks like it might be authentic. Oh, not? might be. It is. Holy shit. This line here shows the path that Ferdinand Magellan took to sail around the world. First guy to do it. You know your history. Only he wasn't first guy to do it. Magellan died in the Philippines on a random beach somewhere. It was his captain, Juan Sebasti?n Elcano, who finished the trip with 17 others. Also known as the Infamous 18. I know the legend that his voyage wasn't about exploration, it was about finding that gold. But it's just a story No. I beg to differ. These trips were hugely expensive back then. The King of Spain couldn't afford it. There wasn't gonna be any trip until a private financier stepped in. House of Moncada. Yep. Bankrolled the Crusades, the Inquisition, Franco's fascists in the '30s, and just about every horrible thing you can think of. They offered Magellan his grand voyage of exploration, so long as he came back with that gold. How much gold? In today's dollars? Five billion, easy. It's the biggest treasure that's never been found. Look, I've been dreaming about this since I was a kid. But somehow you already knew that. When Sam said he had a little brother who was just as into this Magellan stuff, I thought, "There's no way." You know my brother, Sam? Oh, we were practically friends. That's saying something, considering the company I keep. Look. Look at him. He has a beard. Where is he? When was this taken? Almost two years ago, San Sebastian, Spain. We were getting close to Elcano's tomb where Sam was sure we?d find his journal, and in it the location of that gold. Then he disappears. Doesn't call, doesn't answer my texts, nothing. He ghosted me. Yeah, that sounds like my brother. So he hasn't been in touch? Sam? No. Not even a postcard? No, not a postcard, phone call, text message, email, nothing. I don't know what h ed between you two, but I think we ind that gold there?s a real chance we find him, too. What do you say? Sam left when I was 10. He'd call every once in a while, swore he'd come back, but he never did. The Sam that i knew disappeared a long time ago. So. nah. You'll have to find somebody else. Wow. I'm really losing my touch. There's a whole world you haven't seen, but you will. I promise. Hey, kid. What took you so long? So when do we start? There's an auction coming up. Biggest collection of Spanish Renaissance art and artifacts anywhere this c ntury. One of those items is La Cruz de la Hermandad. Only it?s not a cross, it's a key. A key that unlocks the chamber where the Infamous 18 hid their gold. Very cool, but the legend said here are two keys. One for the captain and one for the crew, so, no one man could steal the gold by himself. One key doesn?t do us any good. You ever get outside when you were a kid? How do you remember all this shit? Only one thing. I already have the captain's key. Second one's in there. The Augustine, it's an auction house. It's very exclusive but I got us on the list. All I need you to do is kill the power during the auction. That'll trigger the main alarm, then I can do my thing. Okay. And how am I supposed to kill the power? Well, shit. That's up to you. You gotta bring somethin' to the equation. I?m not cuttin' you in for fun. That's a good point. We haven't spoken about my cut yet. I assume we're fifty-fifty, right? - Fifty-fifty? On what? The gold? - Yeah. Are you high? This has been years of my life. You get 10% and that's me being generous. Wow. That's awfully generous. What e you gonna do with that kinda money? You still working on the tie? I can't figure out he length. I just keep making it all fat. Come here. You know what you're doing? My dad was a Navy man. I can do this one-handed with my eyes shut. You served, too, didn't you? Dishonorable discharge. - You did some homework, huh? - Of course I did. I flew helicopters. I was preserving ome artifacts from a museum in Baghdad. I was over the max load weight, crashed pretty hard. They got all upset, kicked me out. Bit of an overreaction, but what are you gonna do? You say "preserving?... but you mean looting, right? Well, if I didn't take them, somebody else wouId have. - You asked for that. - Thank you. - And what's with the cat? - Oh, the cat? - She?s just for you. - What? Yeah. Your life seemed super sad. No, I'm not gonn keep this thing. They're gonna shit all over my floor. Hey, these people can tell a fake when they see one, all right? You ave to believe the lie you?re selling. You belong here. You're one of them. Or you couId go with the Bubblicious. Jesus. No. This is Bubble Yum. It's the same thing. Here. Put that in your ear. No way. Hello? Hello? I can hear you. I'm sitting right next to you. Shit. I think I pushed it in too far. Is that okay? Let's go. Look at that car. Bet that ain't cheap. Shit. Santiago Moncada. - Like the House of Moncada? - Yeah. He thinks the cross is his by birthright. If he buys it before we can grab it, you can kiss that gold goodbye. Welome, sir. What can I get you? - You know what, I?ll have a martini. - Yes, sir. A martini? Yeah, why not. That'll go great with the bubble gum. You should put the gum in the martini. You'd have a bubble gum martini. That's actually not a bad idea. My God, this girl is totally flirting with me. - Where? - There. The woman with Moncada. Look, she's flirting with me. Hi. It's not flirting, all right? Not with you. That is Jo Braddock. You ever see her coming, You need run the other way. I'm serious. She's coming this way now. Look. Then you know what to do. You'll thank me later. Hello, Victor. Oh, what's the matter? Feelings still hurt after San Sebasti?n? You're something else. So, what ridiculous scheme have you cooked up this time? Well, if I tell you it'll ruin the surprise. Well, you do tend to ruin everything, don't you. I'm not the one working for Moncada. I mean, that's low. Even for you, Jo. Whatever gets me the gold, right? You taught me that, Victor. Incre?ble. Oh, Jesus! Oh, sorry. It's pretty cool, huh? Well, it?s a one-of a-kind solid gold altar crucifix. Handcrafted in Barcelona in the early 16th century, so, yes, it's pretty cool, yeah. Wow. You know your crosses. My family has been looking for this one for a very long time. No way. So have I. You are a collector? I dabble. I don't dabble. This cross has a very tragic history. Eighteen men died trying to hold onto it. So much blood so needlessly spilled. Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please. Good luck to you. Would you please take your seats. The auction will commencing very soon. Hey. Bubble Yum. You done chattin' up our arch nemesis? I'm pretty sure he just threatened to kill me. Don't touch your ear like that. You look like an idiot. Get a move on. Make my way upstairs. Your girlfriend seems pissed. Is that something I should be worried about? Just stay focused. Keep an eye on him for me. If you would please come and take your seats. Thank you very much. Okay, let's get started, then, with lot number one. A magnificent oil on copper, Our Lady of Good Counsel, by Bartolom? P?rez. Hello? Six hundred thousand going once, going twice... Sold to the lady in the back. Thank you very much. The cross is up next, kid. Sully, don't worry. I got it. La Cruz de la Hermandad. Now most of you will know this was made in Barcelona, circa 16th century. It is truly a gorgeous piera and representative of Spanish Renaissance gold work. So we're gonna start off tonight's bidding at 200,000. Do I have 200,000 in the room? Thank you very much. I have an opening bid of 200,000 from Mr. Moncada. Okay. Here we go. Do I hear four? How we doing? We're doing great. Five hunderd thousand it is. Do I have six? I have six. Thank you, madam. I don't have all night, kid. Seven hundred thousand from Mr. Moncada. Do we have eight? No takers? So fair warning on 700,000. That is 700,000 going once... - Don't make me do this. - Seven hundred going twice... And... There we are at the back of the room. Thank you very much, sir. We have 800,000. Eight hundred thousand is the bid, ladies and gentlemen. Do I have nine? I'm spending money I don't have. Okay. Here goes nothin'. Oh, God! Ya should nae come out to play with the big boys, wee'un, ?cause you're about to get a proper Scottish welcome! I'm sorry? Mr. Moncada, it's back to you now. One point nine. Mr. Moncada makes it an even two million dollars, ladies and gentlemen. Well, train's already left the station, right? Why not. Two point one, thank you very much indeed. Mr. Moncada, over to you. Any advances on that? We have two point two, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, God, here she comes. I said ya should nae come out to play with the big boys, wee'un, ?cause you're a' cut to get a proper Scottish welcome! Whoa, whoa, whoa. I literally have no idea what you're saying. You little- Two point two is what we have. Do I have point three? He goes with it. Mr. Moncada takes it to $3 million. Stupid door! Okay. Oh, God. Sully, you're just gonna have to buy that cross. Fair warning, ladies and gentlemen. Three million, going once... Do something now. Kill the power, fake a heart attack, I don?t give a shit. Going twice... And... This is gonna suck. Get on him! Come on, come on! Well, that was something What's your plan now? Well, at least you fat-asses can't come out here to get me. There is a small situation. I'm sure well have it sorted out in just a second. Can we secure the cross, please? Thank you very much. Security, can you go down and find out exactly what's going on? You're doing great. Hang in there. Oh, shit. Oh, my God! Are you okay? Hey, Trent, Addison wanted me to take that to the vault pronto. Thanks. Sully, where you going? You can't leave me. There's only one rule in this game, kid: Don't get caught. Excuse me, sir. We need to ask you a few questions. That?s rude. I should be asking you the questions, if I'm honest. Actually. I'll do you one better. I'll get my lawyer to ask the questions. Starting with who installed that handrail. I mean, look at that thing. Wait, get back here! Even more ridiculous than I could have imagined. I don't know I think it was going pretty well so far. Funny. I think that belongs to me Jo, come on. Save it, Victor. Oh, thank God. Guys, she's trying to steal the cross. Just put down the case and step aside. Yeah, put down my case. Step aside. I'll get this to where it belongs to. Good luck. All right, lady. Stay calm, all right? Sorry sons of... Let's get out of here, Tony. Hey. You surprised to see me? You proved yourself again, kid. That was some swan dive you took. You were just gonna leave me back there. It wouldn't do any good having us both locked up. Somebody had to get the cross. Holy shit, you got it. - Maybe I should hold on to that. - You don't trust me? Oh, is that supposed to be funny? Here. Tony, take us to Teterboro. Unless you wanna get dropped off somewhere else. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sorry, Sully, but I'm all in. Hey, Tony. Teterboro. Wow. The captain's journal. -This is amazing. -There?s some crazy shit in there. It's unbelievable. It totally confirms the legend. Magellan did find tons of gold in the Philippines. They hid the gold in Barcelona and then told the Moncadas that the trip was a bust. Well, you have any bright ideas on how to use the keys? Yeah, here. The captain wrote: "The path begins in Barcelona, where the keys turn into pine." And then there's a sketch of a pine tree. Here. So we're looking for a tree. - Really? - Yeah. Wow. That's your expert analysis? You gave me the book an hour ago. What am I supposed to do? I mean, I got that far on my own. I've seen the picture of the tree. Where?s the gold? Is it under the tree? - Is it in the tree? - I don't now, could be. Look out the window. There?s a lot of trees in Barcelona. Anything you need in Barcelona, Chloe Frazer can get it. I didn't teII her about you yet but she's cool. - Hey, Chlo! - Who the hell is this? I'm Nate. I'm a friend of Sully's. Sully doesn't have any friends. I should know. I'm one of them. That's not true. People love me. And what's with the spy games? Why couIdn?t we meet at the house? I was making sure you weren't followed Come on, you don't think I can spot a tail? Mate, I've been on you since the airport. Really? All the way from the airport? Look, it doesn't matter. Why is he here? Why am I--? Why are you here? Clearly, you didn't tell him. - Chloe has the other cross. - What? - Did I not mention that? - You didn?t. Are you sure? It?s mine basically, all right? We're gonna be partners on this thing. That's the way it's happening - So get used to it. - No. We're not. Look, word to the unwise, everything out of this one's mouth is an exaggeration, a half-truth or an outright lie. You know what? That is not true. See you, Sully. Come one, Chlo. She'll come back. She has to. - I don't think she's coming back. - So? - Where's the cross? - It's in my bag. Check your bag. Do it. Now. Shit! You let her take the cross? You let her take the cross. You better get that cross back! You gotta be kidding me. What a rookie mistake. Could you move any slower?! I got a bad ankle, kid. I can?t be running around out here. Oh, shit! Move! Outta the way! Move, move, move! Move! Listen! You don't know where you?re going with them keys! Look! You're looking for a tree, right? Piss off! Listen to me! The 18 were willing to wait years to go back for the gold. They wouldn't have picked a tree as a marker. They would ave picked something more permanent. You're full of shit. Hey. Let her go. She knows where to use the keys then she doesn't need us, right? - Okay. Be my guest. Get outta here. - Thank you. Bye. If it's not a tree, what is it? At the auction house Moncada called it an "altar crucifix." I didn't think about it then. but it means that the cross was originally made to stand on an altar. In a church. Which church? God, you guys never stop, do you? If we wanna get the gold, we have to figure out a way to trust each other. So give me the key. Which church? "Santa Mana del Pi." Saint Mary of the Pine. This has to be it. You might just be a genius. "Genius" is a stretch. Oh, yeah? Look at that. And now you know why I brought him. Okay. Good work. I'll go see when we might have a private look inside. Whoa. Don't even think about it. What? You don't catch on too quick. She's not to be trusted. You met her for two minutes, she already stole the cross from you. She's coming back. There's a midnight mass tonight so tomorrow?s the earliest we can poke around. - You got our gear at the house, right? - Yeah, come on. Father, you said we were going to discuss this. I changed my mind. I'm allowed. "Moncada family to give away fortune." It's not yours to give. You built none of it. They did. Our fortune is dipped in blood. And giving it all away will erase that stain? I should have cut you off years ago. Ms. Braddock. Welcome to Barcelona as my ancestors knew it - Quite something, isn't it? - Yes, it?s truly an impressive excavation. This competitor of yours, Victor Sullivan... maybe he's the one I should have hired. Victor Sullivan is a liar and a fraud. Any deal you make with him is worthless. Perhaps. But I've been told, he was seen in the Barrio G?tico. Maybe you should look into it. Yes, sir. Good. I found my cross in a crypt in Genoa, but I didn't know it was a key to a much bigger fortune. Sully knew. Doesn't say what happens after we turn the keys. "Trust in your fellow man, for one will go to heaven and the other to hell." Well, it?s ironic, seeing as the only point in having two keys was that the 18 didn't trust each other. Well, good thing they didn't, or we wouldn't be here, right? Like one big happy family. Toast? All right. Arriba, abajo, al centro y pa dentro. Hey, kid, slow down. That?s a vintage rioja, all right? You might wanna just taste it, savor it. Or chug it down like you're on spring break. All good. I'm onto you, you know. Sully. What? He's Sam's brother, isn't he? Oh, wow, you cracked the case. Great job. Does he know what happened? Not yet. I'm gonna tell him. When? Who's still thirsty? I found another bottle of red. Hey, kid, you think she's okay? Who? My cat. You have a cat? The man from the app said he'd feed her, but he didn't text me back yet. I don't know what's cuter. Your concern or the fact that you said "the man from the app." Stop. Do you come here to ruin the one place I find peace? Father, you can't give it away. Tell me it's not too late. You can't change my mind. I'm making the arrangements. This scavenger hunt is over. Father. Do you really have no faith in me? In him I have faith. Who the hell are you? Get out of my car! Santiago, what are you doing? Forgive me, Father. Oh, great. Nuns. Why?s it always gotta be nuns? Let's just split up and figure out where the keys go, huh? Okay. Never thought I'd be back in church, but this one's special. Hey, Sully. What? Nothing. Hey, guys. Come here. Look. "J-S-E." Juan Sebasti?n Elcano. The 18 were here, all right. Look, if that?s the cathedral, then these must be the stairs. And they lead... that way. Thoughts, altar boy? "Caelum. " That's Latin for heaven. It says in the journal, "Trust in your fellow man, for one shall go to heaven, the other to hell." So if heaven's up there, then hell has to be around here somewhere. I hope. Hey, I got a skeleton with angel wings. That?s kinda between heaven and hell, right? Does Mary look a little off to you? Yeah No way. Hey. Come on, open it up. I'm not doing that. We?re in a church. Come on, have some respect. Scared of a little old nun? Well, you haven't met Sister B, have you? Hold that. Here. Okay. Well, there's hell. Holy shit. You found 'em. - What does that look like to you? - A keyhole. Which way should we turn, left or right? I don't know. What does the book say? Oh, right here. Both of you turn your keys clockwise at the same time. Three, two, one... Turn. Shit! Thanks a lot. You almost got me killed. Clockwise, Sully? It was fifty-fifty, so I made a guess. A guess? That could have been our heads. Clearly you should turn the keys the other way. Kid, I don't even have my glasses. I can't read this shit. Yeah, clearly. Just be careful, all right? You're gonna get somebody killed. Okay. Come on, counterclockwise. Just look away from it. Ready? Here we go. Three, two, one, turn. Look at that. I was right the second time, huh? Like an opening back here. You wanna help, Sully? I'm watching our back. What if the nun comes down to get you? Chloe? There you go. All right. We're making some progress. Let?s go. No, wait. Hang on. What does the book say? Heaven and hell. One of us goes up, the other goes down. - Exactly. I go down. - Yeah, I'll come with you. - Really? - What? - That was quick. - What are you talking about? - You're gonna follow her like a puppy? - You want me to hold your hand? - It's fine. Give me your cross. - I'm not giving you my cross. Why would I do that? Because I'll probably need it up there. You have your girlfriend's cross. You don?t need ?em both. - Okay. Good point. Give me your phone. - No. - Sully, just give me your phone. - For what? - Wait. You don't trust me? - I don't trust anybody. I told you that already. - Thank you. - I thought you knew better. Oh, my God. You have so many apps open. What is wrong with you? - Tinder? Really? - I own that. Okay. Now you can track us. Try to stay on top of us, okay? There you go. - Have fun in the haunted tunnel. Enjoy. - Yeah. Oh, we will. This is amazing. I mean, we're the first ones down here in 500 years. Find the other two. I've got Sully. Aye. I got an arrow pointing this way. The Eye of Providence. I say we go with God. But there's literally an arrow that points this way. Suit yourself. But the arrow... I'm gonna go this way. Yeah, we should go your way. We should go your way. Great. Here we go again. Do you wanna work your magic? So when did you decide to become Indiana Jones? When I was a kid, I liked to go exploring. One day I found a bronze statue covered in gems buried under a bridge. I'll never forget the feeling, you know? I ran and showed it to my father. I thought he'd put it in a museum. But, instead, he sold it. He kept all the money. We never saw him again. Wow, that sucks. I'm sorry. Why? I'm better for it. Here. I got just the tool. You see that? Sure, when the big bad nun's not around. Does this look right to you? I don't really know what the path to ancient treasure is supposed to look like. - More ancient? - I guess. Hey, Sully. Do you see anything weird up there? You're gonna have to be more specific. Do you hear that? What the hell? Hey, what's going on down there? Hey, this can't be right, can it? I can't hear one thing you're saying. Come on, let's go. - This definitely doesn't look right. - Look. Above the bar. "Infemum." Isn't that Latin for hell? Yeah, it is, come on. - It's Braddock?s backup. - What? We better keep moving. - What are you doing? - Blending in. Yeah, it's not a bad idea. Hey, listen, I?m not really much of a dancer. - Let's go. - Okay. Hey, two Commonwealths. Okay. What are you doing? I'm causing a distraction. Oh, for God's sake. Do you think it's another puzzle? Whatever it is, you better figure it out fast. I'll try and buy us some time. - Hey, can I get you a drink? - Gin and tonic, por favor. This definitely isn't a gin and tonic, but it is on the house. Gracias. Hey, whoa, let me guess. Pi?a colada? The Eye. Think you?re a comedian, do you, sunshine? Okay, I got it. ...on the Beach. Nate! Oh, shit! Nate, this is not a time for shots. Let?s go! God, those guys suck. Where the hell are we? Well, well, well. Look for a way out. Think I found one. Almost caught up. - You got that key? - Yeah. - Water. - A lot of water. Oh, my God! This has to be a test! The 18 must have built an escape, right? What did the journal say again? "Trust in your fellow man, for one shall go to heaven, the other to hell." "Trust in your fellow man, for one--" - Sully! - Sully! There has to be another keyhole up there somewhere that opens this door! I'm, like, literally in a Papa John's right now. Sully! We're be running out of time! I found it. Excuse me, guys. I'm gonna need a minute. Sully, we do not have a minute! Hand it over, Victor. Oh, shit. Give me the cross. Come on, Jo. You know I can't do that. You haven't said "please." Now. Okay. Didn't I tell you should have said "please"? Oh, come on, Sully. After all we've been through? Sully! Hurry! Shut up. I'm working on it. I'll shut up when you get us outta here. Oh, shit! What's going on?! Sully, if you don't turn that damn key, we?re gonna drown. It's gonna take a little longer than I thought, kid. You gotta help me. Gonna try to get this grate up, okay? I can't believe you walked out on me, you son of a... Why? Did you miss me? Sully! It?s now or never, buddy! We're running out of options down here! Nate! Look at me. We can do this. Okay. We can do this. Deep breaths. Did you miss this, Victor? Chloe! Chloe. Chloe, please! Come on! Okay. It's okay. I'm gonna lift you out. Hey, guys. Say something. Tell me you're alive. Yeah, we're good. We're still alive. Then what are you waiting for? Get a move on. Thank you. You had it. Yeah. You good? Yeah. Hey, Sully, you still up there? I'm here. What do you got? Not much. It's dark as hell in here. I always wanted to try this. - You need to give that thing up already. - Oh, come on. See? It?s all I ask. A little faith. I see a light. Is that you? Yeah, that's us. We're in some sort of Roman antechamber. Whoa. You got that key? Thank you. Okay. No, it doesn't fit. Sully. Okay. Sully. We?re missing something. See if you can find anything up there. - I can't get the grate up. - Forget the grate and look. I see something. Looks like a ladder or something. I think I get it. I think it's the two keys put together. What? I said I think it's the two keys put together. - Throw your key down! - Hey! You two think you're gonna double-cross me? You want the stupid key or you want the gold? Come on, this is it. Throw it down. I'm comin' down there for this. You hear me? You ain't gonna play me. Typical Sully. He?d rather lose the gold than- Thank you. Does that look like a ladder to you? Yeah. Okay, ready? Three, two, one. Did you see that? What are you waiting for? What the--? - What's happening? - We found it. Is the gold there? Talk to me! We're in an old Roman storehouse. It's gotta be at least 2000 years old, and there are these giant urns that are like eight feet tall. Are they intact? Yeah, they're perfectly preserved. What are you waiting for? Open them and get the gold. Give me a lift. Here we go. Three, two, one. Go. - Okay. Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. Okay. - You good? - Yeah. You see anything? Chloe? Salt? Chloe? I think we have a problem. Chloe? They used salt to store food, but I don't know why they'd put-- - What's happening? - No. It's gotta be here. Yeah, or why all the tricks? Answer me, guys. What do you got? The gold's not here. Oh, my God. What? What is it? They never brought it back. The path to the gold starts here in Barcelona but it ends somewhere over here in the East Indies. Hey, Chloe. Give it to me. You?re kidding, right? I?m not getting screwed on this one. Pick up the map and give it to me. Nate, what's going on down there? Slowly. Hey, tell me what's happening. Sully, I got this. You don't have to do this. Don't... try anything. You can trust me. Just put the gun down. You have no idea who you're partnered with, do you? You don't even really know what went down. Went down with what? Sam. Who do you think? What are you talking about? - Ask Sully. - No-No-No-No-No. No. Chloe, please tell me what happened to my brother. Please. You're a good guy, Nate. Too good. Hey, Nate. Wake up. Got you pretty good, huh? I tried to warn you about her, but you didn't wanna listen, did you? What happened to my brother? Stop thinking of the next lie you're gonna tell me. Where's Sam, Sully? I should have told you before. But your brother... He's gone, kid. No, he's not. You said he ghosted you. He's gone. He didn't ghost me. We went down to the captain's tomb together to find the journal. And it was there, right where Sam said it would be. We were on our way out and Braddock and her guys cut us off. They opened fire and Sam got shot. So you just left him there to die. I saw a way out so I took it. So you just left him there to die. What was I supposed to do, get shot, too. Nothing I could do. How could you not tell me this? If I did, you never would have come with me. And why is that so important, huh? The hell am I doing her and not somebody else? Your brother believed that there was a final piece. A last trick the 18 played. I thought maybe he said something or sent you something. Shit. All he ever did was talk about you. So you dragged me all the way out here, let me believe I might see my brother again, because you think that I know something? ? Yeah. Do you? Did you really just ask me that? You said that money changes people. Makes them greedy, selfish. But you know what I think? I think that?s just who you are. I don?t think there was ever a better version of you. And whatever this is, now I?m done. Kid. Mr. Moncada. We've run into some difficulties. The gold was never here beneath the city. Yeah, I know. It's quite embarrassing, huh? I believe there was a clue left down there and we know who has it. Miss Chloe Frazer. My people are out looking for her now-- Oh, yeah. You mean the big guy who doesn't talk and his sidekick, the Highlander? Yeah, they didn't find me. Diversified investment. I hired Miss Frazer the same day I hired you. Of course, she will lead the operation from here on out. I haven't forgotten my promise. Remember, if something's lost, it can be found. I know where she took the map. Moncada. Right? I mean, think about it. Who else has the resources she's gonna need. And Braddock and her goon squad just so happened to find us at the church? He had to have somebody on the inside. You hate me. All right, I get it. Look, I'd hate me, too. But Braddock? After what she did to your brother? She shot him in cold blood. We can't let her win. Sully, will you please just stop trying to play me for like five minutes? For years, I told myself that Sam would come back. That he wasn't go that he was just lost. But, instead, I?m stuck here with you. So this is how this is gonna go. I'm gonna finish what my brother started and then we go our separate ways. All right. It's a deal, kid. Hey. Be careful when you load her. I don't want her getting scratched. Yes, sir. Nice car. Yeah. My father gave me this car when I turned 18. It's been my good luck charm ever since. The map. You know... It's natural to feel some conflict. You made a difficult decision, but the right one. I don't really do regret. Neither do I. Shall we? When you're right, you're right, huh? You don't have to apologize to me now. She only cut us out because he knew you were gonna cut her out. You're still harboring feelings for that girl who knocked you on your... huh? Wow. All right, come on. They're getting ready to go. Maravilloso. Now, who is ready to make a little history? I overlaid the map with modem satellite imagery. We'll drop our supplies from the air, land in Kiamba, Philippines, where we'll be met by our local forces. We should find the pot at the end of the rainbow here. In Cala de Oro. Approaching drop zone. Lowering cargo door. To the victor... the spoils. Come on. Give it to them. Five hundred years ago, my family was betrayed. Yes, a small band of explorers, they found the world?s biggest fortune. And you know what? They hid it. For centuries people searched for it, all in vain. It was left to me... to recover my family's gold. Nobody thought I could do it. And certainly not my... my father. Now, today... is the day I restore the Moncada's fortune. And I bring honor back to my house! And I earn my place in-- Daddy was right. You don't have what it takes. The House of Moncada dies with you. Where's Frazer? No loose ends. That was literally he worst ten hours of my life You wanna get caught, just keep talking. Oh, good job, Jo. Oh, shit. It's hard to find a good partner in this game, huh? Maybe you'll learn to appreciate me a bit more. All right. Let's find some parachutes. Parachutes, what? Unless you know a better way to jump out of a plane. It looks like the lassie's boosted. Hey. Don't even think about it. I can't just let her get away with it. This is not the place to pick a fight, okay? I'm trying to protect you. Put one of these on, let's go. Now. Hey! Did you kill my brother? I said, did you kill my brother, Sam Drake? Nate! Come on! Oh, God! Hey, Braddock! We found your loose end. Now get rid of her. Oh, crap! We can patch this up, Frazer. Drop the gun. I don?t think you've been counting. You?ve only got one shot left. I gotta give it to you, Frazer. A fighter to the bitter end. This is a very bad idea. But this is the end. - Nate? - Oh, come on! - What the hell are you doing? - You just hit me with a car! - You don't have a parachute. - You don?t have a parachute! - Follow me! - What? Aw, come on. Oh, shit! Pull the cord! Nate, come on! I?m trying! Hold on, hold on! I'm not gonna apologize, if that's what you're waiting for. I could probably forgive you for what you did in Barcelona. Maybe even for knocking me out of a plane with a car. But Braddock? Really? You really think there?s any difference between them and you? You and Sully were just as eager to screw me over they were. Look, I'm not Sully, okay? Hallelujah. One's bad enough. Nate. Do you see what I?m seeing? Well, if what you're seeing is endless open ocean, then, yeah. Holy shit. Whoa. What the hell happened to you two? Fell out of a car that fell out of a plane. Something like that happened to me once. Okay. Good luck. And here is your card back, Mr. Sullivan. Please, call me Victor. Come on, I spent ten hours in a trunk with him. I couldn?t help myself. - Let me show you to your room. - Thank you. Moncada's money has bought us everything we need. All right, let's get to work. Hey there. Hey. What are you doing? Are you sure these dimensions are the same as the actual map? To the exact millimeter. Why? Braddock isn't gonna find the gold. Well, not where she?s looking, anyway. You mean we still have a chance? The captain left one final clue, and Sully seems to think that Sam knew what that clue was, and he might have tried to tell me what it was. These postcards are the only thing I've got from Sam in the last 10 years. So if he did try to tell me something... it has to be in these cards. For the love of God, please be trying to tell me something, Sam. Is it something in the images? Or something in the writing. Like a anagram or a cipher. We used to do that all the time as kids. Let's start the images. - Do blue. There's a lot of blue. - Colors. Okay. There's one card where he spells everything wrong. Where is that? T-H-A-R... - Hills. - Hills? Hills. So try writing this out: "Wish you were here, bro." And then for every letter you write down, find the corresponding letter. Wish you were here, bro. I'm gonna go to sleep. Come on, Sam. What are trying to tell me? What are you trying to tell me, buddy? "There's a whole world you haven't seen, but you will." "There's a whole world you haven't seen..." Haven't seen... Okay, come on. Come on, come on. "There?s a whole world you haven't seen, but you will. Promise. Sam." "The keys are your compass. The keys are your compass. The key--" Okay, okay, okay. Some compass, my... Holy shit. Blue goes there. And red goes there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Chloe... Okay. Chloe? I'm sorry, Nate. I like you. I really do. But I learned the hard way the minute to start trust someone, you lose. Yeah, well... too bad you?re headed in the wrong direction. What the hell? Lost. Not gone. There's a difference. If something's lost it can be found. We did it, Sam. We did it. Cloves. You know, back then spices were worth nearly as much as gold. Why am I not surprised? I keep too many apps open, remember? - I knew you'd figure it out. - Figure what out? The puzzle in Sam's postcards. - So, what is it? - Does it matter? I already found the gold. I don't see any gold. Oh, it's here. It?s a false top. Old pirate trick. Here's your gold you've been looking for. You happy now? Holy shit. You gotta be kidding me. Well, look at that, huh? So much more than we thought. Plus the other ship. Plus the value of the ships themselves, which you can?t even put a price on! We did it! We actually did it! Sully, we didn?t do anything. Okay? There is no "we." There's only you. Because there's not a person in your life you wouldn?t betray for a piece of this. You made that real clear. I thought that's what we wanted. No, I wanted to do this with my brother, Sam. Not with you. I know. I'm sorry. Well, look around, kid. You did this. He'd be proud of you. It's Braddock. We'd better get small. - Or, in your case, smaller. - Hey! You're only like one inch taller than me. Max. I think it's a little more than that. Come with me. I know where to go. Magellan's ships. Oh, they're more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. Find the gold. If you see Sully, do not let him open his mouth. Kill him and Drake on sight. Aye. Be careful, gentlemen. These ships are worth a fortune on their own. You put a hole in my boats, I put a hole in you. - I'm not goin' in there. - Hey, look... You could stay up here and get shot in the head or come down here for a quick cuddle. Up to you. I'm going down. Oh, God. Ya see anything? All clear, sir. Braddock! We cannae find them. They're nae onboard. They must've filled their pockets and fled. Keep an eye out anyway. Sully's a cockroach when it comes to gold. Let?s get moving. Wind is 1-5-0, 1-5 knots. Hold TRQ at 4.2. All right, who's clear? What is it with you and small spaces? Got this thing jammin' up my... - Don't even think about it. - Oh, I'm thinkin' about it. Oh, my God. All right, come on. Oh, Jesus. She's flying the ships out. And us with them. What do you mean she?s flying us out? Victoria, thiss Trinidad. Are you ready to receive? Over. Roger that. Victoria standing by. Let's bring her home. - You ready up there, Scotty? - Aye. Hold TRQ at 4.2. Jeez, the boat's full of that stuff. Just in case. No. Hey. You wanna go show 'em what's what? - Let me see it for a second? - Nice, huh? - Yeah, real nice. - Hey! Holding st?ady! You ready for a mutiny? Why not. Oh, shit - That one's a little more your size. - Yeah, cute. Not my gold! Oh, shit. You gotta hijack that helicopter. Right to the point, huh? All right. You know drill. You don't have to touch with your finger to use it. Hey, Sully. Don't crash. Just what I needed. Positive reinforcement. Thanks. Hey! All hands on deck! Raise the anchor! Hoist the mainsail! Hey! Jack Sparrow, stay sharp. Oh, come on, man, I've been waiting to do this my entire life. Hey, guys. All right, Victor, you got this. Come on. Easy. Hey, Jo! Follow that ship. Hey, Sully, I think your girlfriend wants her boat back. Yeah, I?m aware. - Load them up! - Gol - Clear! - Go! Lets see what this shitcan can do. Shite! Hang on, kid, I'm gonna get us out of here. Okay. Gunpowder. Look at that. There we go. Come on, baby. I think that did it. I still got it. Oh, shit. Hey, you still with me? Barely. Yes! You gotta do something. They're coming right at us. I think I have an idea. Okay. What's going on? Sully, will you please just shut up? I?m working on it. That's your idea? No! Ah, come on! No, no, no. no. No, no, no. Oh, God! Shite! What a shot! Mother Mary! We're home free. You did it, kid. You did it. Yeah, Sully. If I lose, so do you. Hey, Sully, this ain't over. Damn it! What's going on? Come on, we're so close! Shit! No, no, no! No! Damn! - Say hi to your brother for me. - You first. Sully! Sully, no! Please! Shit Hey, Braddock! Nate! Come on! Trust me. I gotcha you, kid. I gotcha you. Come on. Look at her. You can't put a price on that. Yeah, you can, actually. Like four to six billion. We could just get a diving rig. Not before those guys. It's property of the Philippines now. Hey, I just wanted to say thank you for what you did for me back there. You know, ever since my brother Sam left-- Oh, you-- Can you hear me? I can now. I was just saying we should get outta here. You got it. Hey. Is that who I think it is? Yeah, I might have let her steal the wrong coordinates. Hey, you're starting to figure it out, kid. Yeah, I learned from the best. You got a heart of gold, Sully. Real funny, wiseass. What, too soon? Forever is too soon. Here, maybe this'll help. I got you something Are you kidding me? For real? Yeah, look. I got this. - You gotta be kidding me. - And these. - You got more? - I got loads of it, look. Keep it coming! You?ll like this one. Here you go, here you go. This means a lot to me. That was my last piece, man. - Come one. Let's get outta here. - All right, hang on. ? Provided by danghuong18 ?
