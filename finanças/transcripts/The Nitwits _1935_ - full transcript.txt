YOU MUST'VE DRUNK THE BOTTLE, TOO. NO, I--I'M NOT KIDDING! LAKE IS IN THE MARKET FOR A MURDER SONG. YEAH? OH, WELL, THEN JUST LEAVE IT TO ME. NOW, THE FIRST THING WE GOT TO DO IS TO GET A TITLE. HOW'S THIS: "ALWAYS BE GOOD TO YOUR MURDER"? NO, THAT'S NO GOOD. HOW ABOUT "I'LL KILL HIM WITH KINDNESS"? NO, NO, THAT'S NOT BRUTAL ENOUGH. Paperboy: EXTREE! READ ALL ABOUT THE BLACK WIDOW! CITIZENS THREATENED WITH MURDER! EXTREE! THERE'S YOUR IDEA FOR A SONG! YES, AND IT'S TOPICAL, TOO! I'LL GIVE YOU A TITLE FOR IT RIGHT NOW: "BLACK WIDOW, I LOVE YA." NO, THAT'S TOO ROMANTIC.

[MACHINE BUZZES] I CHEATED THE DICE! I CHEATED THE DICE! I CHEATED THE DICE! OHH! OHH! LET HIM GO! WE MAY GET A SET OF GOLF CLUBS. OHH! MR. DARRELL, I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HOW WELL YOU HANDLED THAT CLEVELAND CASE FOR ME--THAT'S THE REASON I CALLED YOU. I WANT YOUR ADVICE AND PROTECTION. I'M GLAD YOU DID. THIS, TO ME, IS QUITE GENUINE AND EQUALLY SERIOUS. THERE'S A DANGEROUS MANIAC LOOSE IN TOWN, AND NOBODY IS SAFE UNTIL HE'S APPREHENDED. YOU SEE, WINFIELD? IT WASN'T A HOAX. YOU WILL TAKE THE CASE, WON'T YOU, MR. DARRELL? I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO ASSIGN ONE OF MY BEST OPERATIVES TO ACCOMPANY MR. LAKE WHEREVER HE GOES. NO, NO, NO, I DON'T WANT ANY UNDERLING TO WATCH OUT FOR MY LIFE; I WANT YOU. I HAVE A LARGE ORGANIZATION, MR. LAKE. I'M SORRY, BUT MY PRESENCE IS REQUIRED HERE IN AN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY. WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR PRICE IS, JUST SO LONG AS YOU GUARD MR. LAKE. YOU MAKE A SLIGHT TACTICAL ERROR IN SUGGESTING THAT I-- WELL, THAT I ACT AS MR. LAKE'S BODYGUARD. BUT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION, AND I SHOULDN'T FEEL SAFE UNLESS YOU WERE WITH ME UNTIL THIS THING CLEARED UP. BESIDES, I'M WILLING TO PAY-- YOUR SECOND ERROR IS IN YOUR APPROACH. NOW, IF YOU CAME TO ME AS A SPORTSMAN AND ASKED ME TO INDULGE IN MY FAVORITE PASTIME, HUNTING AND TRAPPING, THEN I MIGHT BE INTERESTED. THEN YOU WILL HELP ME? I WILL, MR. LAKE. THANK YOU. WE'LL BE REALLY GRATEFUL. [SNAP] OUCH! OW! HEH. HELLO, MARY! I'M SORRY, JOHNNY. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I DIDN'T EVEN FEEL IT. ANY LUCK? NOPE. I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO WIN THAT RING. OH, I MEAN ABOUT WRITING THAT MURDER SONG. OH, YEAH, I STAYED UP AND WROTE IT LAST NIGHT. NEWT'S HOME NOW PUTTING ON SOME FINISHING TOUCHES. OH, I HOPE IT'S THE BIGGEST HIT EVER WRITTEN! IF IT IS, WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR OWN LITTLE HOME AND, UH, OUR OWN LITTLE CAR AND, UH, OUR OWN LITTLE CHILDREN. LET'S PUNCH FOR THE RING. 950. YOU WIN SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT.

UH-OH! I'M LATE! BYE. HERE, TAKE THIS! IT'S YOUR SONG! NOW'S THE CHANCE TO SELL IT TO LAKE! I CAN'T. I FEEL LIKE I GOT 3 TONGUES. WELL, SING WITH THE MIDDLE ONE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WHICH. GIVE ME THAT THING! I'LL SELL IT TO HIM... AND I'LL PUT SOME FEELING IN IT, TOO! OH, MR. LAKE? I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU: "THE BLACK WIDOW'S GOING TO GETCHA."

YOU'VE GOT MORE GALL THAN ANY MAN I EVER MET, AND IF YOU EVER TRY A THING LIKE THAT AGAIN, I'LL HAVE YOU THROWN OUT OF THE BUILDING! DO YOU GET ME?! I GUESS HE DOESN'T CRAVE THE BLACK WIDOW. YEAH, HE WALKED OUT ON US. REMIND ME TO HATE HIM, WILL YOU? FOR A MOMENT, THOSE TWO BOYS HAD ME WORRIED. WELL, WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ASPIRING SONGWRITERS, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

YEAH--I'M A SONGWRITER. WELL, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME, DARRELL. GOOD MORNING. OH. COME IN, CLARK. WHAT'S HIS IDEA OF PULLING THAT "GOOD MORNING" LINE? I USED THAT IN A SONG TWO YEARS AGO. HE STOLE THAT FROM ME. LOOK HERE, LAKE. I'VE BEEN CHECKING UP AND I'M GETTING CHEATED AROUND HERE. THE TRADE PAPERS SAY THAT MY SONG'S LEADING THE COUNTRY. WELL, I'M PAYING OFF ON MY BOOKS, NOT ON YOUR CHECKUP! WELL, BOOKS CAN BE WRONG ACCIDENTALLY OR ON PURPOSE, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET AWAY WITH THIS! I'VE BEEN THREATENED BY MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN YOU ARE. LURCH, COME IN HERE! YES, SIR. Mr. Lake: AND BRING THE COMPLETE FOLDER ON "YOU OPENED MY EYES"! YES, SIR. HERE YOU ARE, HAL. I'LL TAKE IT DOWN TO JOHNNY. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO HIM? OH, I ALWAYS KNOW WHERE TO TAKE YOUR NOTES WHEN YOU WRITE WITH A SMILE.

LURCH, UNLESS YOU FIND OUT WHERE THAT SLIP-UP IS, I'M GOING TO CALL IN OUTSIDE AUDITORS. THAT'S ALL. YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING ON AN ACT... BUT I'M GONNA GET WHAT'S COMING TO ME, OR SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET WHAT'S COMING TO HIM! GOOD DAY. DID YOU HEAR THAT? "GOOD DAY." HE SWITCHED MY "GOOD MORNING" LINE. MR. LAKE WILL SEE YOU NOW. THANKS. THANKS VERY MUCH. NOW, LOOK HERE, HAZEL. I'VE WASTED A LOT OF TIME WITH YOU, AND I'M VERY BUSY. POSSIBLY YOU NEED AN ASSISTANT... I DO EXECUTIVE WORK, TOO. I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY AND EVERY DAY BEFORE: THERE IS A MARKET FOR A COMEDY SONG LIKE "YES! WE HAVE NO BANANAS." I HAVE IT. I WROTE A SONG ON THAT ORDER. WHAT'S YOUR TITLE? "YES! WE HAVE NO ORANGES." WELL, LET ME HEAR YOUR FIRST CHORUS. YES, WE HAVE NO ORANGES... COME ON! LET ME HAVE THE REST OF IT! THAT'S AS FAR AS I GOT. I--I CAN'T FIND A WORD TO RHYME WITH "ORANGES."

Darrell: JENNINGS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? A BLACK WIDOW, EH? LAKE RECEIVED AND IGNORED SOME THREATENING MESSAGES FROM THE BLACK WIDOW. HE SHOWED ME ONE IN MY OFFICE YESTERDAY WHEN HE ENGAGED ME. SO THE BLACK WIDOW FINALLY STRUCK, HUH? [WHISPERING] I'M GOING TO FAINT. [GROANING] OOH! LOOK! HE'S FAINTED! WELL, WHAT ARE YOU STANDING THERE FOR?! WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING?!

WE LOVED EACH OTHER DEARLY. WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE HIM? IN THIS OFFICE THIS MORNING. WAS THERE ANYONE WITH HIM WHEN YOU CAME IN? JUST HIS SECRETARY. I SAW HER AS I WENT OUT TO TALK TO MR. DARRELL. WHERE IS THE SECRETARY? YES, WHERE IS MY HUSBAND'S CHARMING SECRETARY? YOU SAY THAT THE BUZZER WAS RINGING WHEN YOU CAME IN AND FOUND LAKE DEAD? YES, SIR. WELL, IF HE WAS DEAD, WHO WAS RINGING THE BUZZER? HIS LEFT HAND WAS RESTING ON IT. HIS RIGHT HAND LOOKED TO ME LIKE HE WAS REACHING FOR THE GUN. WHAT GUN? WHY, THE GUN THAT WAS THERE. I DON'T RECALL SEEING IT SINCE I PHONED FOR THE POLICE. SAY, WHERE'S THAT GUN? MY GUESS IS IF YOU FIND HIS SECRETARY, YOU'LL FIND THE GUN. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! STOP HIM!

WHY, WINFIELD LAKE WAS KILLED OVER AN HOUR AGO. WELL, I JUST FOUND MY HEAD. NOW, LISTEN, YOUNG FELLA, IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF A JOKE, YOU CAN GET YOURSELF INTO AN AWFUL LOT OF TROUBLE! DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM, CAPTAIN. HE'S JUST ACTING. YOU SAY THAT YOU KILLED WINFIELD LAKE? YES! I'LL TEACH HIM TO PULL A KNIFE ON ME! I CUT HIS EAR FROM THROAT TO THROAT. YOU MEAN YOU SHOT HIM IN SELF-DEFENSE. NO, I SHOT HIM THROUGH THE HEART. WINFIELD LAKE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD! WELL, HIS HEART WAS IN HIS MOUTH. I REITERATE! SO DO I! I REITERATE! CAPTAIN, ARE YOU GONNA LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THAT? I REITERATED FIRST! I'M TELLING YA I'M THE ONE THAT KILLED HIM, AND I SHOT HIM WITH THAT GUN. JENNINGS? MAY I SEE THAT GUN? WELL, SURE. I'D ALMOST BELIEVE HIM IF HE HADN'T OVERLOOKED ONE VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL: THEY DON'T HAVE LOADED GUNS IN PUNCHBOARDS. DARRELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. I THINK YOU'RE LYING! WE'RE BOTH LYING: THE MAN WAS DROWNED. SOMEBODY MUST'VE LOADED THAT GUN! THAT'S A VERY CLEVER DEDUCTION, YOUNG MAN. SHE LOADED IT, AND SHE KILLED LAKE. COME ON, MISS ROBERTS. YOU'LL HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH US. I REMEMBER NOW! I PLACED THE GUN ON THAT DESK! NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU TWO, GET OUT OF HERE. GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE!

YAA! NO, I DIDN'T DO THAT! OH, CHIEF, I'M SORRY. NO, NO, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT FOR YOU; I MEANT IT FOR THIS NITWIT! OH, PLEASE DON'T. WHAT HAPPENED? HIT HIM ON THE BACK! HOLD STILL, CAPTAIN! GET HIM A GLASS OF WATER! HE'S CHOKING! HE'S CHOKING! HOLD HIM! HOLD STILL, CAPTAIN! WAIT A MINUTE! COME ON, JOHNNY. SNAP OUT OF IT. THROW YOUR HEAD BACK AND SMILE AT THE WORLD. YEAH, BUT FAIR MARY IS LOCKED UP ALL BY HERSELF, AND THAT CAPTAIN JENNINGS WON'T EVEN LET ME IN HIS OWN JAIL. YEAH, HE'S MAD AT US, AND I KNOW WHY. WHY?

I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD RESCUE ME. IT WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD; I'D ONLY BE ARRESTED AGAIN. BUT YOU CAN'T STAY IN JAIL. JOHNNY, DO YOU KNOW WHO'S AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THIS? YEAH: ME! LISTEN, WHEN I WAS HIDING, I SAW LURCH... KILL LAKE? NO. BUT HE WAS TRYING TO GET INTO MR. LAKE'S DESK AND SOMETHING FRIGHTENED HIM OUT. BUT WHAT WOULD LURCH WANT IN LAKE'S DESK? I DON'T KNOW. BUT IF YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT HE WAS AFTER... WE'LL RUSH OVER AND SOLVE THE MYSTERY AND BE RIGHT BACK! DON'T LET THE POLICE SEE YOU. THE POLICE DON'T BELIEVE A WORD WE TELL THEM. WELL, I'M OFF. WHOA! HOW DO YOU DO, MRS. LAKE? WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. MR. DARRELL, I RECEIVED ANOTHER OF THOSE NOTES FROM THE SAME PERSON WHO KILLED MY HUSBAND. MRS. LAKE, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE... OTHERS HAVE BEEN THREATENED. IT DEMANDS MONEY AND I'M GOING TO PAY. WELL, THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE THE ONLY PRACTICAL THING TO DO. HOWEVER, CAPTAIN JENNINGS WILL BE HERE IN A SHORT TIME, SO LET'S LEAVE THE FINAL DECISION UP TO HIM. OH, HELLO THERE. HELLO, DARRELL. WELL, WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? FRANKLY, I FIND MYSELF IN A VERY PECULIAR POSITION. YEAH? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, I'VE RAISED THE WHITE FLAG TO A CRIMINAL. I'VE ADVISED MY CLIENTS TO PAY THE EXTORTION MONEY. WELL, THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY INVOLVED-- TO SAY NOTHING OF THE LIVES-- AND THIS UNFORTUNATE MURDER OF LAKE'S HAS CONVINCED ME WE'RE DEALING WITH A PRETTY DESPERATE CRIMINAL. I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE YOUR APPROVAL OF MY ADVICE. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA, DARRELL. HAVE ALL YOU PEOPLE RECEIVED DEMANDS TO PUT THE MONEY IN THE SAME PLACE? YES. RIGHT. YES, IN THE BASEMENT VENTILATOR OF THE LAKE BUILDING AT 12:00. I GOTCHA. IF THE SINISTER CRIMINAL WILL TRY AND PICK UP THAT MONEY HIMSELF, AND WHEN HE DOES, HE'S GONNA FIND IT PRETTY HARD TO GET OUT OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, BECAUSE I'LL HAVE A TRAP AROUND THAT BUILDING EVEN A MOUSE COULDN'T GET OUT OF. SPLENDID. ALL RIGHT, DARRELL. GOOD-BYE, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION. VICK, YOU STAY CLOSE TO THE PHONE. THE POLICE ARE STAKING OUT THE LAKE BUILDING TONIGHT AND THEY MAY NEED YOU BOYS. OK, CHIEF. [BELL TOLLS] I THINK I HEARD SOMETHING. SHUT UP. SEE? DUCK. [RAIN FALLS] WELL? WHAT ARE THE PLANS? FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA DO IS TO GET MY INVENTION, TAKE IT UPSTAIRS, AND PUT IT ON LURCH'S CHAIR. THEN WE'LL OPEN MR. LAKE'S DESK AND FIND OUT WHAT LURCH WAS AFTER. YEAH, BUT SUPPOSING LURCH COMES IN IN THE MORNING, SITS IN THE CHAIR, AND CONFESSES BEFORE WE ARRIVE? HOW WILL WE KNOW? WE'LL STAY THERE AND WAIT FOR HIM. YOU KNOW, A MURDERER ALWAYS RETURNS TO THE SCENE OF HIS CRIME. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S A GOOD THING WE'RE ON THE JOB. IF IT WAS UP TO THAT FLATFOOT JENNINGS, MARY WOULD NEVER GET OUT. BOY, YOU SAID IT. "FLATFOOT" IS RIGHT. COME ON. Jennings: GET HIM, BOYS! RILEY, TURN ON THE LIGHTS! [MACHINE BUZZES] WHOA-OH! WHOA! JENNINGS IS A FLATFOOT! JENNINGS IS A FLATFOOT! JENNINGS IS A FLATFOOT! WHOA-OH! YOU'RE A FLATFOOT... BOTH OF THEM ARE FLAT! [BUZZING STOPS] SHUT THAT THING OFF! HEH. HOW ARE YOU? HA HA! CAPTAIN JENNINGS. HA HA! CAPTAIN JENNINGS. THAT'S A FUNNY THING. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL, AND HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? YOU NIPPERS, WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT INTERFERING WITH THE LAW? ISN'T IT FUNNY? WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU, CAPTAIN! WEREN'T WE, NEWT? YEAH. WE WERE JUST SAYING WHAT A NICE GUY YOU ARE. WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE, ANYWAY? WHY, WE CAME TO GET THIS THING. WHAT'S THAT FOR? YOU'LL FIND OUT. YEAH? WELL, YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT YOU CAN'T INTERFERE WITH ME AND GET AWAY WITH IT. GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE! OH, NOW, CAPTAIN JENNINGS, WE'VE GOT TO GET IN THE BUILDING. NOBODY GETS IN THIS BUILDING. GET OUT OF HERE. IF I EVER SEE YOU AROUND HERE AGAIN, I'LL LOCK YOU UP. YOU MEAN THAT? YES! ALL RIGHT. WHAT NEWT SAYS ABOUT YOU GOES DOUBLE. COME ON! Johnny: COME ON, NEWT! Jennings: GET OUT, AND STAY OUT! [POLICEMAN GROANS] [CAT SHRIEKS] UH-OH. WHAT WAS THAT? WHATEVER IT WAS, IT WASN'T HUMAN. COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. [SNICKERING] CAN YOU IMAGINE JENNINGS THINKING HE CAN KEEP US OUT OF THIS BUILDING? YEAH, WELL, HE'S DONE ONE BIG FAVOR FOR US. HE'S FIXED IT SO NOBODY'S GONNA COME IN TO ANNOY US WITH OUR WORK. WE'VE GOT THE ENTIRE BUILDING TO OURSELF. WELL, COME ON. LET'S GO UPSTAIRS AND GET STARTED. GOOD. YOU KNOW, WE BEING IN THIS BIG BUILDING ALL BY OURSELVES MAKES ME FEEL KIND OF SPOOKY. I THINK I'LL FIND A SWITCH AND PUT THE LIGHTS ON. YEAH, WELL, IF YOU DO, I'LL PUT YOURS OUT. PLUG THAT IN. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? BRING JENNINGS AND HIS MEN UP HERE? WHAT ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT, ANYWAY? COME IN. WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING HERE THIS TIME OF NIGHT? LISTEN, SLEEPY, THE COPS DONE RAIDED THE POOL HALL WHERE WE WERE SHOOTING DICE. WE'VE BEEN RUNNING AND RUNNING AND RUNNING... YEAH, WE IS. HOW COME WE CAN'T FINISH THE GAME HERE WHERE IT'S NICE AND QUIET? YES, AIN'T NO COPS TO BOTHER YOU HERE. YOU CAN JUST SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT. HEH! YOU KNOW, I'M JUST DYING TO SEE THE EXPRESSION ON LURCH'S FACE WHEN HE SITS IN THAT CHAIR. WHEN HE SITS IN THERE, WE'LL GET MORE THAN HIS EXPRESSION; WE'LL GET THE TRUTH. [MACHINE BUZZES] PERFECT, PERFECT. COME ON. [DESK DRAWER JOSTLES] I HOPE NOBODY FINDS US OUT. I HOPE NOBODY FINDS US IN. [DESK DRAWER JOSTLES] HAVE YOU GOT A KNIFE? THANKS. WHAT'S THAT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT IF IT'S THE MURDERER, LET'S GIVE HIM... LET'S GIVE HIM WHAT? LET'S GIVE HIM PLENTY OF ROOM. WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE? I'M TRYING TO FIND A RHYME. WHAT GOES WITH "ORANGES"? GIN. THE BLACK WIDOW! LET'S GET HIM! Newt: YEAH! GET HIM! HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT WITH US! Newt: COME ON, CONFESS. Johnny: WE GOT YOU! WAIT A MINUTE! IT'S MR. DARRELL. GEE, MR. DARRELL, WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THAT HAPPEN FOR THE WORLD. I SHOULD SAY NOT. YEAH, WELL, FORGET IT, BOYS. FORGET IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WELL, THAT'S NOT FAIR; I ASKED YOU FIRST. BOYS, I'VE GOT TO SOLVE THIS CASE. MY WHOLE PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION'S AT STAKE. BUT I THINK I STUMBLED ACROSS SOMETHING TONIGHT THAT OFFERS A SOLUTION. THEN YOU CAN PROVE THAT MARY'S INNOCENT? I THINK SO. WHERE'S THE PHONE? IN THE OFFICE, DOWNSTAIRS. ANYTHING YOU DO FOR MARY, YOU'RE DOING FOR ME, MR. DARRELL. [BOP] I'M GOING TO PHONE MY OFFICE FOR A COUPLE OF THE MEN TO COME UP HERE AND HELP ME REENACT THE CRIME. YOU CAN'T; THE COPS WON'T LET THEM IN. WHY SEND OUT FOR MEN? WE'RE HERE ON THE JOB. WE'RE A COUPLE OF REENACTING FOOLS. NOT AT ALL A BAD IDEA. IT SAVES TIME, AND FURTHERMORE, WHATEVER WE HAVE TO DO, WE HAVE TO DO QUICKLY. OK. WHAT DO WE DO? NOW, I WANT EVERYTHING IN THESE OFFICES PRECISELY AS IT WAS BEFORE LAKE WAS MURDERED. NOW, YOU, JOHNNY, I WANT YOU TO BE THE SECRETARY. YOU GO IN THE OTHER OFFICE. AND YOU, I WANT YOU TO BE LAKE. I WANT YOU TO SIT IN THE SAME POSITION THAT LAKE WAS IN WHEN HE WAS MURDERED. AHEM. YEAH. WELL, UH, I THINK I BETTER PLAY MARY. YOU PLAY LAKE. NO, YOU PLAY LAKE. NO, YOU MAKE A GOOD LAKE... ALREADY YOU GOT WATER ON THE BRAIN. AND I'LL BE LURCH, THE BOOKKEEPER. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, TAKE YOUR PLACES. OH, I WANT TO GET STRAIGHTENED OUT THE ONE THING: WHO AM I? YOU'RE MARY, AND I'M LAKE. THAT'S RIGHT: YOU'RE MARY, HE'S LAKE, AND I-- I'M THE BLACK WIDOW! I'M THE BLACK WIDOW! WHAT THE-- SAY, WHAT IS THIS THING? AHEM. GEE, I'M SORRY IT SHOCKED YOU, MR. DARRELL. IT'S JUST A LITTLE INVENTION OF MINE. AND YOU SAID IT NEVER FAILED TO MAKE YOU TELL THE TRUTH. WELL, IT'S--IT'S ACTED BEAUTIFULLY UP 'TIL NOW, BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT FAILED. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE THE BLACK WIDOW WHEN WHAT YOU REALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS THAT YOU WERE LURCH, THE BOOKKEEPER. YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, SHUT THAT THING OFF. IT'S OFF. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, GO BACK TO YOUR POSITIONS... AND NO MORE INTERRUPTIONS. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT DARN MACHINE? Johnny: AFTER ALL YOUR HARD WORK, TOO. HELLO, VICTOR? GET OVER HERE QUICKLY. YEAH, THAT'S ALL. NOW, YOU GO ON INTO MARY'S OFFICE AND STAY THERE UNTIL I CALL YOU. BUT SAY SOMETHING ONCE IN A WHILE... I WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. LET ME SEE, NOW. I'M MARY? THAT'S RIGHT. GO AWAY, WILL YOU? GO AWAY! PLACE IS FULL OF COCKROACHES. BOO! WHAT'S THE IDEA OF SCARING ME LIKE THAT? I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW I'M ALL RIGHT. WELL, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM NOT. NOW, GO BACK AND TRY IT OVER AGAIN, AND STAY THERE UNTIL I CALL YOU. OH, MARY? WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS WHO? MARY--HOW'D SHE GET OUT? WE'RE REENACTING! NOW, GO BACK AND TRY IT AGAIN, WILL YOU? OH, NO, NO. I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE AGAIN ALL BY MYSELF. IT'S TOO DARK. YOU'VE GOT TO GO AND STAY IN THAT OFFICE... THAT'S YOUR PRIVATE OFFICE. EVERY SECRETARY HAS GOT TO HAVE A PRIVATE OFFICE. ALL RIGHT, I'LL MAKE MY OWN OFFICE. WHOA-OH! DID YOU SAY SOMETHING? A GENTLEMAN TO SEE YOU. OOH! JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE. IT'S A GOOD THING HE SAID "PLEASE." YOU KILLED LAKE! WHAT? YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID! HE SAID, "YOU KILLED LAKE." PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR. FACE THAT DOOR. JUST STAY THERE. I'M SHOT, BUT IT DON'T HURT. HE MUST'VE HIT YOU IN THE HEAD. LOOK! HE'S FAINTED! NO, HE WAS SHOT! THAT'S THE WAY THEY GOT LAKE! GET IT! [GUNSHOT] Newt: WHOA-OH! [BAGPIPES BLOW] WHAT IS IT?! WHAT IS IT?!

WE FIXED IT SO HE CAN'T GET HIS GUN BACK. HA HA HA! ARE WE GOOD OR NOT, HUH? GREAT WORK, BOYS. YEAH. LET'S GO UPSTAIRS AND GET HIM. DON'T YOU THINK WE BETTER CALL THE COPS? WHY GIVE THEM THE REWARD? YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. DARRELL. YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'LL TAKE THE CREDIT... AND WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU, TOO, MR. DARRELL. YEAH, BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF US. I INTEND TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, BOYS... BOTH OF YOU. I CHECKED WITH THE NOVELTY COMPANY, AND HERE'S THE NUMBER OF THE GUN ON THE PUNCHBOARD. OH, YES. 65427, EH? THIS IS 618--NAH. JUST AS I THOUGHT.

WELL. WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? MY NAME'S CLARK. CLARK, EH? I GOT A WARRANT OUT FOR YOU! WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS? NOTHING.
