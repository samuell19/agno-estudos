Because it's a violation. - How you doing? - VERNITA: I'm here. Well, I can't advise you to do that. I hear banging. [PHONE RINGS] - VERNITA: William Henry Jackson. - Well, open it. Right, open it before they kick it in. Hello? VERNITA: No. No. Dear Jesus. ROMAN: Hello? VERNITA: Oh, God. Where'd they take him? Roman! William's had a heart attack outside his building. He's at MLK. - Is it serious? - VERNITA: Of course it's serious. He's at the emergency room. Call the hospital, and see what you can learn. ROMAN: I'll tell you what to do. I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do. Get Kibby on the phone. He can cover for him. - VERNITA: Kibby retired. - When? Years ago. Now, listen, Roman, William had a full day today. - Okay. - You have to cover for him. - Okay. - Tell the clients and the prosecutors and the judges what's going on. - Okay. - VERNITA: Get continuances. - Okay. - VERNITA: Just continuances. Just continuances. I typed up his day. It's in there on my desk. - All right. - Dear Lord. Okay. VERNITA: Just continuances.

Any loose change. You must remove it so it can be scanned. OFFICER 2: Next person. Put your arms out. Just hold right there. Listen, my iPod, I got 8000 songs in here. The last time I put that in there I lost the bass range on Gil Scott-Heron's "Winter in America." Brian Jackson. Everything gets scanned. - OFFICER 2: Step up, please. - OFFICER 1: Next. OFFICER 3: Thank you, sir. [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS] OFFICER 3: All phones off. Phones off. [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] All phones off. Excuse me, sister. Where's the, uh...? The court for white folks? Phones off. Wack-ass. BAILIFF: Quiet in the court. ROMAN: Uh. Excuse me. What do you have on number 32? Langston Bailey? [CLEARS THROAT] This says William Jackson's his lawyer. Well, Mr. Jackson had a heart attack this morning. I'm Roman Israel, his partner. I didn't know Jackson had a partner. Well, I don't have the, uh, patience for the butchery that occurs here. Mr. Jackson does. You want a continuance? What bail you offering? No bail. And he pleas to count one. I'll tell the judge and request a minimum five years. He's facing 15 at trial. For a 17-year-old breaking and entering? Hell, why don't we just get it over with and shoot him? That's the offer. Do what you gotta do. Offer doesn't really, I mean... He's not taking top plea. I can tell you that. You're already overcharging him. L-Let's talk about mitigating circumstances. He was caught wearing a T-shirt with a gang symbol. Like the flag pin on your lapel. Five years. That's as low as the People will go. People? What people? There's no people. There's just you making a bullshit career-climbing offer. Come on, let's admit it. Present it to your client. His name is Langston. He's a high school junior in good standing. Plays on the soccer team. All of this despite that his father's in jail. His mother is in drug treatment. And due to a legion of forces beyond his control, he joined a gang for acceptance, family, and protection. He has one prior minor offense. Each one of us is greater than the worst thing we've ever done. Deep bows. Please, talk to your client. My conviction rate's 100 percent. BAILIFF: All rise. Court of District Nine is now in session. The Honorable James Hurakami is presiding. [DOOR BUZZES] Langston Bailey. JUDGE: Thank you, bailiff. You may be seated. Wow, five to seven? Thought I was going to juvie though. I want to speak to Mr. Jackson. He's in the hospital. When's he coming back? Wish I knew. I want a new lawyer. I want to switch. I have rights. Mr. Jackson is the one who comes to court, but he comes to me for legal guidance. Now, you're being overcharged to accept a plea, and to keep things moving. They want to punish you for even asking for a day in court. It's a volume business. With guards getting overtime, and private companies owning the jails and building them as well. It's a fact. You want to fight, we'll fight. I mean, to hell with the bill. But if we take it to trial, and you lose, they hit you with 15 years. And they rarely lose. Keep your head up. [SNIFFS] And do some push-ups. This is a preliminary hearing on the case of The People of the State of California v. William Carlos Ramirez. Case number A64-9725. Counsel will state your names. People are represented by Michael Wesley. Roman J. Israel, Esquire, on behalf of Mr. Ramirez. Mr. Israel, I'll grant a continuance, given lead counsel's medical emergency. Um. I'd like to dive right in, Your Honor. Very good. Proceed. Uh, your Honor, the People request the defendant, Mr. William Carlos Ramirez be held to answer on three counts of violating Health and Safety Code Section 11351: possession of powder cocaine for sale. Mr. Ramirez was observed and filmed making three drug sales to undercover officers. Mr. Ramirez made a confession to detectives that he supported himself selling drugs. Objection. Motion to strike. Mr. Ramirez was told he was not under arrest, and was interrogated without the benefit of his Miranda warning, yet he was refused use of the bathroom. That's a violation of civil rights. Um, it wasn't an interrogation. It was an interview. Overruled. If a cop hauls you in, and says you can't use the bathroom then you're being detained. JUDGE: We're moving on. What was he supposed to do, your Honor, pee himself? You can wait, and address this at trial. I would like to address it now. I'm just saying we have a real... Mr. Israel. Did you hear what I said? If... armed guards in this courtroom detained you and would not allow you to use the bathroom you would, by all definition, be detained. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. I'm gonna hold you in contempt if you continue to pursue this. With all due respect, you're asking me to obey an erroneous court decision. You tell me to wait. In my experience, wait... [GAVEL BANGS] Okay. Find you in contempt. Is there anything else you'd like to add before I set fine? [CAR HORNS HONKING] VERNITA [ON PHONE]: I told you to just get continuances. ROMAN: Yeah, I'm filing an appeal. VERNITA: Five thousand dollars? Well... "I wouldn't trust a lawyer that didn't get complaints from the prosecution or the court." Who said that? - VERNITA: I have no idea. - William. VERNITA: I can always count on you to say the utterly inappropriate thing. I'm with Lynn now. She's very upset about it. How is he? VERNITA: It's not good. They're still running tests. All right, well, I'll come over to the hospital. VERNITA: Don't. He's not even in his room. You understand? - Yeah. - VERNITA: What's that? Well, Lynn says we'll talk about it tomorrow, Roman. Good night. - [MACHINERY GRINDING] - [MEN YELLING] [♪♪♪] - [MUFFLED MACHINERY POUNDING] - [PEOPLE CHATTERING OUTSIDE] [DIAL TONE RINGING] MAN [RECORDED]: You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department Noise Enforcement Team. Please leave your name, contact telephone number, and a Noise Enforcement Team officer will contact you as soon as possible. Thank you, and have a nice day. [VOICEMAIL BEEPS] Yes. My name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire. I'd like to report a construction noise violation, 570 Gladys Avenue. That's G-L-A-D-Y-S Avenue, Los Angeles. City regulation 5612 prohibits construction and-or repair of any kind between the hours of 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. the following morning. Thank you. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] MAN [RECORDED]: Please leave your name, contact telephone number and a Noise Enforcement Team officer will contact you as soon as possible. Thank you, and have a nice day. [VOICEMAIL BEEPS] ROMAN: My name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire. I want to report construction noise at 570 Gladys Avenue. That's G-L-A-D-Y-S Avenue. City regulation 5612 requires that there is no construction or repair of any kind between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. the following morning. Five-six-one-two. That's the city regulation. That's the law. I'm a lawyer. Goodbye. [DOG BARKING DISTANTLY] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] - LYNN: Hello, Roman. - Hi. - This is George Pierce. - Nice to meet you. Pleasure. The doctors have concluded that William is in a permanent vegetative state. Ah. Well, he'll surprise them. LYNN: Well, we'd like to believe that but not this time. You get a second opinion? LYNN: He's had three. Now, Roman, my uncle gave me financial and medical power of attorney. If the firm was stable, we'd have time to mourn but it's not, and we don't. William's directive asks using George in the event of incapacitation. And George has generously offered to take time from his busy practice to sort through the remaining cases, help close the office, and collect what's due. Well, I probably haven't had time to consider all the, uh, you know, various ramifications of this. None of us have. I can't live on my accolades. Well, Lynn was hoping to give you and... What's the receptionist's name? - LYNN: Vernita. - Vernita, severance. But looking over the books, it just doesn't seem possible. I'll take over. Ahem. No, you're not capable of continuing the practice. GEORGE: On your contempt fine, we can argue extreme emotional distress and hope for a reduction. Right. B-b-but I'll take over, because in the architecture of this firm, I am a pillar. Yes, and, Roman, I'd hoped to reward you for that. Hope don't get the job done. What does that mean? That means hope don't get the job done. LYNN: Is it ego or delusion? Honestly, I... I never paid enough attention to you. This place runs more like a charity service than a law firm. It's run a deficit for years. We... his family, can no longer afford it. We're clearing the books. We're handing this off to George. Roman, I'm sorry. [PHONE RINGING] God, help me. Yeah, just tell him to wait. No, just tell him to wait. I'll be there in 30. Less. All right. One sec, one sec. - So you have...? Uh-huh. - I'll talk to him. I'm sorry, man. I feel for you. [♪♪♪] This where the bulldog did his work? What a mind. He was great in the seat and great on his feet. Jesus, didn't he ever throw anything away? My secretary's gonna call. She'll be point on this. What do you use? LegalPRO? Quicken? What's that? Status on every case, depositions, investigations, uh, conferences. What, on cards? You're kidding. I'm not helping you fast-plead just so you can get a fee. Well, I'm in court every day. I fight hard for my clients. You're a low-flying bee. Is that what William said about me? William never mentioned you. - What's that about, then? - Fact. Recorded fact, every case. Organized and available. And you can fact-check that if you'd like on your legal Quicken. I don't have time for this. My office will call to coordinate going forward. Let's watch him now. Young George. State of California v. Jason Angelo Fisher. One of his first cases. Fisher's first offense. Should have been reduced to misdemeanor possession. But you pled him out to felony, conspiracy, and possession. That became your M.O. Take a retainer, waive your client's rights to a prelim, then dump them on the public defenders when they complain. What, you worked the Fisher case? His appeal? I recall reading the record. - That was seven years ago. - Eight. So you're saying you know all that from memory? Seven years, eight months, 47 days. I'm quite confident of my recollections. Well, my win-loss record is above 90 percent. That's false and misleading. That's only if you count your three years as a prosecutor. Well, William thought highly enough to bring me in if something happened. Believe me, I'm going to find out why. GEORGE: Roman. Hey, Roman. Where you going? - Where you going? - MLK. Come on, I'll give you a ride. I'd rather walk. Come on, Roman. I just want to talk. William taught a term at Loyola. That's where we met. I was, uh, top of my class. Potential's a bitch. Well, I'll tell you what's not is having four offices and 60 people working for you. He picked me because I tossed him work. You know, loser cases I didn't want, or I was too busy to handle. This, closing his office, it's payback. I'll collect a fee. Look, it just so happens I could use someone with your ability and your power of persuasive argument. And I'll pay you twice what William gave you. What do you say? What makes you different from this car? Whoa. Really? Okay. I'm gonna tell you something I think maybe will surprise and disappoint you. I got a kickback from William for every single case I gave him. Bullshit. I have the records. Apparently, you've been untouched by the messy business of running a small criminal defense firm. Was it wrong? On some level, sure. Does it diminish what he did? Hell, no. No, it allowed him to keep the doors open. It kept you two going. And to this day, I still remember quotes from his class. And that voice. "What is tolerance? It is the consequence of humanity. "We are all formed of frailty and error. "Let us pardon reciprocally each other's follies. That is the first law of nature." So what do you say we forget the past and move forward? Pull over. [CAR HORN HONKS] I can't work for you. GEORGE: What are you gonna do? I'll continue in criminal litigation. That's a bitch of a market. - What if you can't find something? - What? For argument's sake, if you can't find a firm, what's next? There is no next. There is no argument's sake. There's underwear model or activist attorney. There is no next. [DIAL TONE RINGING] - JESSIE [ON PHONE]: Yeah, George. - I want to bring someone in. JESSIE: Are you asking me, or are you telling me? Jackson had a guy who drafted all his memoranda. I think he's a bit of a savant. GEORGE: He paid him 500 a week. We can bill him out for that much an hour. [♪♪♪] [WELDING TOOLS CRACKLING, HAMMERS POUNDING] [MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY] Maya. It's Roman Israel. Sorry to keep you waiting. I usually work off scheduled appointments. It's okay. I had some pretzels and soda from down there. That's fine. So Jeff tells me you work with William Henry Jackson. Yes, for 36 years. We are... We were partners. He was the public face of the firm. I was the man behind the curtain, so to speak. How is he? Unconscious several weeks now. I'm so sorry. Well, come on in. Um... I have no safeguard against unemployment. So William and Ronald were old friends and associates going back to Berkeley. Mm-hm. Yeah, I'm aware. Ronnie mentions William in his book. Right. Yes, yes. I'd like to speak with him. Ron is at our headquarters in Washington. There something I could help you with? Uh, well, um... First, notwithstanding I don't know if I could do this much longer, progressive lawyering. You see, I'm not accustomed without William. The criminal side of our practice funded our policy and legal challenges, as in defendants' rights, uh, prison conditions, and drafted attacks on state and federal criminal codes. If I was freed from criminal work, I can get back to my roots. The bigger battles, organized mass action supported by sweeping legal challenges. With my skill and, uh, experience I'm-I'm quite certain I can get this organization right back in line with its core beliefs. - This organization? - Yes. Yeah. I-I wasn't aware that we, um, had strayed. Well, I'm not talking about nickel-and-dime reformism. I'm talking about igniting a sustained mass movement, supported by rule change and injunctive relief. And I could get results using class-action tactics. I'm talking about a return to using activist litigation creatively, defensively, counter-offensively. I am very proud of what we've done here. I think we're making significant headway in many, many areas. Well, in my experience, that's, uh, an excuse to-to feel good and to slack off. Oh. Who's slacking off? I attended Western State College of Law at Argosy in Fullerton. Started the first student union there. I chose cause over ambition. I could've joined one of the big firms like the rest of them, and been seduced. But I was inspired by Mr. Jackson. I went to work for him. You can... There's a detailed record of all of our victories. Civil rights victories on there. As for my personal life, at a certain point I had to decide whether to have a family or career. I couldn't do both. So I stayed on the front lines. Now, I'm offering at this time... to work, exclusively... as your, um... long-haul, three-dimensional, revolutionary, in-house, full-time, paid advocate. Mr. Israel, we're all volunteers here. Our few salaried staff work out of D.C. I'd go to interview, but I'm precluded for pecuniary reasons. Money of late's been a motivating factor in my life. Well, be that as it may, uh, positions are filled. Look, I'm well worth having in this thing. I have no doubt of that. Because there's something to be fired up about. We are, believe me. Ah, well, I'll, um... Go through William's Rolodex. Thank you, uh, for your time. You know, if you're, uh, interested in volunteering we're having a meeting next week. We could use someone with your legal expertise. Perhaps you could give a talk. I'd like that. Here's my card. I crossed out the office address. And I wrote my home address, so you can reach me via mail. I'll probably just text you. I can do that, I think. - Thank you. - Yeah. Thank you. Right on. What a freak. You stand on his shoulders. [♪♪♪] ROMAN: Good afternoon. Yeah, my name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire. Yeah, Israel. Yes. Yes, like the... Like... Yes, right, exactly. I'm an attorney, civil rights attorney. I was inquiring about a possible job... Uh, yes, ma'am. Right, if I... If... Right, ma'am, if I had a job, I wouldn't be calling you. That's why I'm calling. I don't have... Hello? ...C-K-S-O-N. And I'd like to speak to someone about any possible positions... Yeah, I'll reach out again. In case any jobs come up, I'd appreciate a call back. Yeah, good morning. My name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire. I can send you my résumé. I was with William Henry Jackson. I'm hoping to find if there's an employment opportunity... No, not the number that's crossed out. It's the number below the number that's crossed out. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. [PHONE RINGING] [ANSWERING MACHINE TONE] WOMAN [ON VOICEMAIL]: Um, Mr. Israel? George Pierce would like you in his office right away. The best thing to do is engage fully with the process. Otherwise, you feel powerless, and you... - [KNOCKS ON DOOR] - Come on in. Roman, I'd like you to meet Felicity Ellerbee. - Felicity, this is Roman Israel. - Hi. He'll be working closely with me on this. Sit down. Roman's a terrific attorney. We're very lucky to have him. Felicity's nephew Derrell was arrested two days ago in connection with an armed robbery during which a clerk was sadly killed. Derrell's been charged with assault, first-degree murder. It was his friend that was there with him. It wasn't Derrell. Derrell didn't know that he was going to do that. Of course. We completely understand. Derrell was not the shooter. It's our job to prove how uncomplicit he was in the actual murder. The way this will work is Roman's gonna be the point person. And you were very, very wise to retain private counsel. I'm not gonna lie to you, Derrell's got a mountain to climb. It's imperative he receives the best defense. I can promise you that's what he'll get here. FELICITY: I had to mortgage my house. ROMAN: Oh, I'm sorry. I don't like lawyers. [LAUGHING] Me either. I understand. If I don't get answers to my questions, if I don't see results, if I see padded shit popping up in my bill, I will fire your ass. I'm putting up my house. I understand. You always dress like that? Ah, well, uh, in lieu of wardrobe, I have a reputation as a dedicated advocate. Let me give you my card. If there's any questions concerns, anything you want to talk about, day and night, free of charge, I'm here. I'm available for you. It's not the crossed-out number. It's the number above the crossed-out number. What's "Esquire" mean? Uh, it's a designation, uh, in the legal arena. It's like a title of dignity. Slightly above gentleman, below knight. [♪♪♪] [RINGING] Yes. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] GEORGE: Come in. Roman, I'd like you to meet James Lee. Jim, this is Roman Israel. He'll be working closely with me on this. - Hi. - Please sit down, Roman. Roman's a terrific attorney. We're very lucky to have him. Jim's wife, Mari, was cited last night for felony DUI hit and run, with added charges for reckless driving and injury. The way this will work is Roman's gonna be the point person. You were very wise to retain private counsel. Mari's... She's gonna need, and deserves, the best defense possible. We're gonna make sure she gets exactly that. WOMAN: From George. MAN: It's at that point, per the night manager, that Derrell's friend, Carter Johnson shoots the clerk twice in the head. - Okay. - They empty the register, roughly $500, and then run into the alleyway where Derrell is caught and Johnson escapes. Johnson is a shot caller with the Rollin 100. He's got four outstanding warrants, including two for prior shootings. Now, your boy Derrell is... Don't use "boy." Your client is seen entering the store on the outside camera but the inside video wasn't working. The Armenian Community Council put up $100,000 for Johnson's arrest for the clerk, who was Armenian. Your client Derrell has two priors going back four years. Uh, one for drug possession, marijuana, and the other for theft. LAWYER 1: I have a domestic violence case. This guy assaulted the same woman six times, and she's swearing out an affidavit for non-prosecution. - Have you heard of Tempura House? - No. What's that? LAWYER 2: It's a shelter for lightly battered women. [LAWYERS LAUGHING] That's funny. That's funny. Turn on the light, they run like roaches. You work here? Yes, sir, I do. Jessie Salinas. Supervising attorney. Roman J. Israel. I'm the new guy. Did you just compare us to roaches? There's no tiptoeing into this. LAWYER 1: We're just blowing off steam... You're tourists. I'll see you around, Israel. Roman. Roman. Jesus. I heard about you today in the kitchen. Salinas is our number two. Not only that, you were schooling Sanchez in a crowded elevator? That man doesn't understand character evidence. Then find a quiet corner. I sent you an e-mail today to come to my office. I'm sorry, but when people send e-mails, they think it goes straight to your brain. You better take what I'm saying seriously, because I'm being very sincere with you. You knew what you were getting when you brought me in. Well, I thought you were functional. I think you brought me in to put your feet to the fire, 'cause you're tired of treating low-income clients like dollar signs, and maybe you remember what it feels like to care. That's what I think, George. No, I hired you to make a buck. Which is why I thought you took the job. I need money. Heh. Badly, of course. But what I really need, George, is an ally. I've been waiting to meet someone of your high caliber. And, yes, I am selective. So what I'm offering to you right out here now is a chance to partner with me on a piece of groundbreaking litigation I've been working on for over seven years now. Inside this case is arguably the most important legal brief in modern legal history. A sweeping federal challenge that could yield nothing less than a grand new era of social reform. And I say that with all due competence. The Constitution guarantees us a right to a fair trial, but there can't be any fairness if 95 percent of all cases never get heard. Criminal cases never get heard by a jury or a judge. I am building a wholly original class-action lawsuit with over 3500 names, all former clients aimed at the heart of plea-bargain reform. I'm talking about reforming a system where prosecutors are trying to pull sentences out of their hat. Where guilt or innocence is being completely replaced by fear of having your day in court. Where people are being forced, George, to plead guilty under the threat of overly harsh and coercive sentences. It's a job for a legend, or someone who wants to be one. Let me tell you about it. No, no, no. Jesus, just stop. Roman, enough. Not speaking out is ordinary. We're agents of change, George, each one of us. Now, I don't have the resources to finish this on my own. But with your assistance, I'm more than certain that we can finish this and file it together. Partners on a landmark class-action suit built on precedents and procedure and actual proof, weight of proof. I'm sure of it, George. Look, do you want this job or not? Yes or no. - Yes. - Then you stop harassing people. You stick to clients, you stick to memoranda only. That's it. Nothing else, under no conditions. Now, you have any more pressing opinions, you share them with me. Don't come in tomorrow without a suit. Okay. [HUMMING] Driver's license, California Bar card, visitor ID. ROMAN: Yes. I'm here to see Derrell Ellerbee. ROMAN: How they treating you? You need anything? I need to get out of here. You understand the charges? Yup. They want to bury me. All right. From now on, everything we discuss will be confidential. [WHISPERS] I gotta be careful. Is somebody threatening you? Look, I didn't shoot that guy. Okay? I just went in. I didn't know what he was gonna do. You gave a statement to the police. Yeah, I asked for a lawyer. And before that, after they read you your rights, you continued to talk to the detective. They said you said that you saw Carter Johnson with a gun. I didn't know he was gonna use it. Knowing he had a gun when you entered the store that's aiding and abetting. Criteria for first-degree murder. CJ. CJ shot the clerk. All right? I saw it. I'll testify if they let me out. They're not gonna release you. Case is too strong, charges too severe. Now we can talk to the DA. See what they'll offer for your testimony. Probation? ROMAN: Best you can hope for is a possible reduction to second-degree murder. [SIGHS] OFFICER 4: Right over here. Have a seat if you're so scared, man. Look, I know where CJ's holed up. Plus testifying. What's that worth? Worth a lot. The two combined can carry significant weight. But you understand the risks? What you're looking at? Yeah. I gotta be transferred to protective custody first. This what you want to do? I don't want to, but I will. [♪♪♪] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Hello? [PHONE RINGING] No one's supposed to be in here. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm... I'm an attorney here, and I was looking for Mr. Pierce. I wanted to talk to him about this case. He's in depositions all day. Mr. Salinas is supervising attorney in his absence. You'll have to leave. I'm sorry. SALINAS: I don't know why they sent me this. I need more than this. WOMAN: That's all we got. SALINAS: I don't want the summary. - I want the full deposition here. - Okay. And what about tomorrow? What's my agenda? - WOMAN: You're downtown all day. - SALINAS: What is first? WOMAN: Mr. Rutner at 9 a.m. SALINAS: No, I don't want to meet with him. [NUMBER PAD BEEPING, DIAL TONE RINGS] [EXHALES] [DIAL TONE RINGING] - WOMAN [ON PHONE]: Hello? - Ah, hello. My name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire from the law offices of George Pierce. I represent Derrell Ellerbee. I'd like to speak to ADA Kate Becker. KATE: Speaking. Oh. Oh, okay. Sorry. - Uh, h-hi. - Hi. My client, Mr. Derrell Ellerbee is interested in discussing a deal. I have 40 open cases, so refresh me. ROMAN [ON PHONE]: Right, uh, uh... Convenience store shooting. An Armenian man was killed, and there's a reward offered? Uh-huh. Okay, I have it. ROMAN: The shooter, in this case, is a fugitive Carter Johnson. My client may know his whereabouts and might be willing to testify. He'll deliver on that? Well, that depends. If you waive all objections and appeal, and he's willing to cooperate, then we'll drop the assault and kidnapping. And we'll reduce murder one to manslaughter, voluntary, 10 years. Involuntary, three to five. No, a 21-year-old clerk was killed in a commission of a robbery. It won't happen. Well my client is giving you the whole case at a great risk to himself. Let's discuss mitigating circumstances. Let's not. Voluntary manslaughter, 10 years. It's a good deal. It's an enema of sunshine. I don't have time for this. Well, I'm sorry for taking a nanosecond off of your assembly-line, rubber-stamp existence. The People withdraw their offer. I don't care what the... Hello? [♪♪♪] ROMAN: Hi. - Hi. - MAYA: Hey. You didn't want to park closer? There are spaces. No, I don't have a car. Wow, that's gotta be tough in L.A. I've always imagined life with one. Thanks for doing this. Oh, you're welcome. Public speaking is something I'm usually encouraged to avoid. MAYA: So in anticipation of Tuesday's protest, I've invited attorney Roman Israel to talk about our rights, and what to expect if you are arrested. Roman. Thank you. [CLEARS THROAT] All right. Back to my beginnings. It feels good. Hell, that was 40 years ago. So here we go. We're gonna... We're gonna rap... I don't mean hip-hop. [SCATTERED LAUGHS] ...a little while about some good old-fashioned grassroots, in-your-face protesting. The time has come to put social revolution squarely back on the agenda where it belongs. Look at you. [♪♪♪] Just like I was. Just starting out your fight against the dominant tendencies of our society. Well, you better get ready for the commitment it takes to lead a resistant lifestyle. You better start forging the armor to withstand the temptation and the financial and emotional toll. Because when it comes to social injustice and judicial indifference and institutional racism and outright goddamn greed the overwhelming majority of the people in this country just don't give a damn. - MAN 1: That's right. - MAN 2: That's right. Civil or uncivil disobedience. The First Amendment to protect your right to freedom of speech as long as you don't incite violence or law-breaking. And there are gonna be people that get caught up in the march. They're gonna vandalize. They're... I'm sorry. Excuse me. I see two sisters standing. Why are the sisters standing and the brothers sitting? If we wanna sit, we can ask. Well, you ladies gotta speak up for yourselves. This ain't 40 years ago. There's no statute of limitations on chivalry. - That's gendered and sexist. - And polite. - And patronizing. - And polite. What kind of law do you practice? I'm a criminal defense attorney. You ever represent domestic violence defendants? Many times. Knowing that they're guilty? Meaning what? Meaning you have a choice. Watch it. Someday you may need the Sixth Amendment. - Oh, that's lawyer talk. - [LAUGHING] Oh, I see. So we got a Sarah Lawrence soul sister in the band. Ha, ha, I'm not your sister, asshole. Oh, whoa, whoa... I'm not an asshole, sister. Hey, fuck you, brother. [CROWD TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Settle down, okay? Thank you, Roman. - ROMAN: Okay. - Did you bring something to help? [♪♪♪] MAYA: Roman. Roman. I feel like I need to apologize for that. No you don't. It's my fault. I say things. - Are you okay? - No, I... Yeah, it's okay. It just got out of hand. My meanings seem to obfuscate more than clarify. I mean, that's what the discourse is. - It's changed over the years. - Right. - It's what we talked about. - You did. That's a lot of what this is about. I just can't seem to remove myself from what's happened in my life. I... This is where we are, the way the world is. And I didn't even want to come out. The nuns said I was a forceps baby. - Me too. - Yeah? - No. - No? [LAUGHING] No. MAYA: Is he okay? ROMAN: I don't feel anything. MAYA: Check his neck. ROMAN: No. What happened? We just found him. I think he's dead. FEMALE OFFICER: All right, don't touch anything. MALE OFFICER: Man down, black male, 60 years of age. Not responding. Request RA. What did I just say? He doesn't have ID. What did you put in there? - My card. - Take it out. Well, without ID he'll get cremated and mixed up with 1000 other homeless people. Take it out. It's just my name and number for the coroner to call me. - Did you hear my partner? - MAYA: Okay. - Do what they say. - I want to pay for the burial. I'm not telling you again. I won't let him get swallowed up. I won't let him disappear, completely forgotten. He most certainly was somebody. [COUGHING] WOMAN [ON RADIO]: All Wilshire units. Possible 187. Suspect there now. Western and Third at Chinatown Express. Suspects are two male Hispanics. Number one, large build... I'm sorry. What do you mean? That was unbelievable. I thought he had no pulse. No one does that. Yeah, for good reason. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hey. Yeah, I-I stepped out. I'll be right back. - I have to get back. - Yeah. Okay. [♪♪♪] I'm gonna call you. Yeah, thank you. Me too. We have a problem. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] GEORGE: Come in. Close the door. Where did you get the idea you could try and negotiate a plea? Who told you you could do that? To just ignore what I emphatically told you? Derrell Ellerbee was stabbed and killed this morning in general lockup. His aunt told me that Derrell requested protective custody last night, but was delayed because the prosecutor said you pissed on her deal, Roman. That offer should, by law, have been presented to the client, it was not. As of now, you've exposed us to a malpractice suit, Roman, I would kill to be on the other side of. You've had difficulty comprehending my meaning, so I'll be very, very clear. As much as I wanna fire you, I can't, as that could be construed as acknowledgment of wrongdoing. So I'm gonna retain you, Roman. I'm gonna retain you, and then I'm gonna fire you. If you attempt to quit or you stop coming in I swear to God, I'll hit you with a motion to recoup damages and I'll have you disbarred. We're done here. [DOOR CLOSES] [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING, MUFFLED] [MAN PANTING] Yo, hey, man. Hey. Yo, man, I'm sorry to bother you, man, but... Maybe you can help me out with money or some... I mean, anything.

Last ripple of a mighty wave washed ashore here. And left us high and dry. No, he didn't leave us. He'll never leave us. I thought it was built on good ground, but... there's nothing under it. Roman, what's wrong? You're too near me to hear me. Can't you see? It's clear as crystal. - VERNITA: What? - We filed the wrong brief in the wrong court to the wrong judge. VERNITA: What are you talking about? A world where everyone's feelings are reciprocated. The capacity for everyone to contribute. Come on. Freedom is something you can only give yourself. That's nothing he agreed with. I don't have any time anymore. I don't have time to waste. Trying to... tell people not to sleep so tight. Telling people to turn around. Toward what? Roman, sit down.

Oh, I must have been out. You... You don't know what I'm talking about. - You're firing me? - No. No. People became concerned after you went to the hospital Friday morning, and it was decided, after some discussion, that it was best not to leave a message on your phone. William died. [CLEARS THROAT] When? Friday night, actually. - I'm sorry. - You didn't kill him. There's gonna be a small private funeral on Wednesday, and then a full memorial in several weeks. Is that it? I don't know what you're feeling... given how close you were. I mean, I guess... I guess I can kind of imagine. Yeah. I put that behind me. Well, I'm sorry for my outburst the other day. I was... I was overly harsh. Lynn's been telling me how vital you were to William's work. Always in the shadows, never flagging, and I pulled you out of the back room and forced you out onto the floor. It was... It was a lot to ask. I've gotten Felicity Ellerbee to sign a document absolving us of any wrongdoing in her nephew's death. It's a good thing that she... She believes that you were just acting in Derrell's best interests. So that's in the rearview. I've also learned today that we picked up three new clients, all of whom came as referrals from your cases. It seems like your personal attention, giving out your cell phone, is quite the calling card. I wanna institute the practice for all our attorneys. Good. Look, you can still leave, of course. I fully understand. I think maybe there's a... Maybe there's a place for you here if you... - I wanna stay. - You would? Yes. I mean... I'm tired of doing the impossible for the ungrateful. I now have, uh, more... practical concerns. The, uh... The suit's a big change. Thank you. I prefer double-breasted, but, uh... Ha. You broke open the piggy bank, huh? Yeah. Yes, I did. My lack of success is self-imposed. [♪♪♪] So, Israel, there's a rumor that you know the CPC by heart. Yeah. Guilty as charged. - Pleadings. - Nine forty-eight, 973. - Demurrer for irregularity. - 1248. Money laundering. 186.9, 186.10. However, all pleadings in those cases are subject to the laws of joinder and severance. That's, uh, 954. - JESSIE: Wow, impressive. - BETH: Nice. You gotta be kidding me. I gotta go. See you, Jessie. Listen, um, I got a Prop 36 I could really use help with. Okay. We handled a lot of DTC motions at my old firm. Awesome. Um, I have some free time this afternoon, if you do. I don't know what your caseload is like, but I'll stop by? - Yeah. - Great. [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [CAR HONKS] So where do you currently live? Further away. Well, if you lived here, you'd be home by now. Well, what do you think? I think that whatever we're chasing... you got it all here. - I'm sorry? - When can I move in? - Immediately. - I'll take it.

[CHUCKLES] Okay. I'll see you then. Bye. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Everybody in? All right, let's get started. Under the new fee structure, our advance on felony cases rises from 2000 to 2500. Our felony daily rate rises to 1500 from 1000. Now, of course, some people are gonna gag at the new numbers, but what we're selling is our impressive win-loss record, our depth of talent, all you fine people, and, ultimately, our lower all-in costs. Take time to explain it to people. If you see a potential client heading for the door, you emphasize our new personalized approach. All right, I've also decided to devote a share of our time to pro bono. Now, that's not an area we have much experience with, but someone here does. It's the first he's heard about it, but Roman will be heading up our new pro bono program. Roman, you wanna say a few words? Will this cut into my salary? [ALL LAUGHING] I mean in terms of billable hours? [LAUGHING] Okay. All right. Connor, you'll be assisting Roman. I want to get moving on it right away. Folks, take a look. It's already in the new brochure. All right, questions? Nothing? Good. Roman, I didn't dress for this place. Oh, there's no code. It's a bit uncomfortable for me. You don't like it? This will cost a fortune. Well... Yeah. We deserve it. You know, I really heard what you said, the first time you came in. About progressive lawyering being the cornerstone of modern activism. Particularly given the tunnel that we're descending into. You, the few lawyers like you... Thank you. You really took up the mantle of leadership with your own advocacy. You're out there... and alone for so many years. I feel like... I don't know. I feel like I was meant to meet you. [CHUCKLES] Ah. - Thank you. - I've been going through my own struggles. You know, trying to balance what I do... [SIGHS] and the sacrifices. I've asked myself many times, "Why do I see things so differently from other people?" [SCOFFS] You know, why...? Why do I care so much that our humanity is connected to each other? [SIGHS] I have moments... I have extended periods of real doubt. I'm just holding on by a thread. So, uh... hearing you... and, um, understanding what you've been through... ...and, uh... Thank you. Just knowing you. I mean, honestly, Roman, you're inspiring. [SNIFFS] I've never had it before, but... I imagined Duck à l'Orange to be different somehow. Jesus, I'm being serious. Perhaps you need to look at things differently. - [SIGHS] - You all right? - How? - Well... the world is for wonderful things, isn't it? Define "wonderful." Okay. As an example... who says... you can't steal a car in self-defense? In reference to what? If one required a means of escape, so to speak. Escape from what? Possibility to actuality. I mean, it follows. The logic is valid, thus the premise is true. Every weapon is a tool if you hold it the right way. [VOICE RECEDING FAINTLY] You're saying to justify something? I'm saying... purity... ...can't survive in this world. Living conditions have bearing. MAYA: I'm talking about the burden of activism. Exactly. MAYA: What are you talking about? [RINGING SOUND] My ears are ringing. MAYA [FAINTLY]: It's somebody's phone. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Roman. [PHONE RINGS] It's very difficult to be truthful. Not just with principles... but with yourself. To admit that you want something else and to try and act on it. But I don't want something else. I feel blessed to believe in something. The way you do. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Thanks for dinner. That was very generous. The portions were small. I'm moving into a new place in a few days, after 35 years. You're going through a lot of changes. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of worried I'm gonna miss my old place. Maybe you should wait until you're sure. Nah, signed the contract. I can't go back. - I called a car. - Already got you one. See, I can Uber and text. It's right here. [CHUCKLING] - Thanks again. - You're welcome. Goodnight. I just want you to know how much you've helped me... - by, uh, meeting you. - Mm. For what you do. [CHUCKLES] - Your hair looks great. - Thank you. [♪♪♪] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] PASTOR: William lived on grand notions, influenced by impractical ideas... in a house trembling with promise and shouts of triumphs yet to come. Imploring and inspiring. A believer that the moral arc of the universe is long, but bends towards justice. He ignited a spark in each and every one of us... and that light can never die. [SOBS] LYNN: We have over 1000 attending the memorial. Yeah, and not one of them returned his calls when he was alive. I think it would be great if you spoke. And tell them what? - You two talk the same language. - Yeah, no, thank you. - If it's nerves... - It's not. - There's no one more deserving. - They wouldn't wanna hear it. Hear what? The real enemies aren't on the outside. They're within. VERNITA: We'll talk soon. I'll call you. VERNITA: You take care of yourself. I am. I disbelieve that. I'll be in touch. Roman, I'll see you at the office. I have something for you. ROMAN: No, you're right. That 2500 is higher than average. But let me direct you to our firm's win-loss record, our lower all-in costs, personalized service. - It's all there in the brochure. - I don't know. ROMAN: You're wise to price shop. Very, very wise. When it comes to defending your loved ones, there's a lot of people in prison that would attest that that's a bad idea. [BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH] [IN ENGLISH] We're going to do it. Okay.

Man, you've had some crash course, huh? From William Henry Jackson to George Pierce? What a ride. You seem to be settling in okay though. From all appearances. I got a lot of plans, Roman. I mean, nothing we have to get too deep into here, understand, but... down the line, there is a lot I'd like to discuss. I'm gonna want your thoughts. You know, closer community contact... taking on more family and housing cases, setting up alternative work arrangements. All while actually increasing productivity and retention, which is not to suggest it's about drumming up business. I mean, something's gotta get you up in the morning, right? ANNOUNCER: Yes, three point. GEORGE: And going back to William Henry... I told you I still remember quotes from his class. "I believe - [MOUTHING] - because of my beliefs." Cards-on-the-table time: I was gonna leave law, before I took his class. After him, I doubled down. You know, all his talk of what could be and the difference one man could make. You gotta make a living. Four offices, this market? It's... It's no small thing. Of course he didn't see it that way. He told me I was, uh... I was drowning in the shallow end. - [MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ON PA] - [CROWD CHEERS] Worse was, I knew it. And then you come along, you... You shake things up a bit, and here we are sitting, talking new possibilities, where we can go. Hell, I don't have to explain. You get it. Christ, you're gonna be right in the middle of it. [CROWD CHEERS] [♪♪♪] - INMATE 1: Come on, man. - INMATE 2: That's bullshit. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] GEORGE: Oof! L.A. traffic, man, there's no getting around it. Glad I caught you before we came in. We just landed this. It's a capital case. You have experience with those? We handled quite a few. I'll make the introduction, then I'll bow out and you'll stay. Okay. I looked at that prison overcrowding case you and William worked on. Which one? Against Men's Central. - You prevailed. - Oh, that was overturned. Yeah? How's your big plea-reform brief going? Ah... Put it aside. Well, tell me more about it. I'm interested. Carried it as far as I can take it. Well, how about some help? I mean, I've been thinking about it. I've become less skeptical about the possibilities and scope of what you said. I could devote office resources, help you complete the brief. We could file at federal court together. That's the first step. It'll take years of commitment to see it through. Commitment doesn't seem to be a problem for you. I hear you're moving to a new apartment. - How'd you hear that? - Payroll comes across my desk. - I know that building, not cheap. - ROMAN: I had money saved. I mean, it's great. It's a nice building. No, I mean, I had money saved for a long time. - Well what else is it good for? - Ha, ha. - You got your ID? - Yeah, yeah. George Pierce and Roman Israel to see our client, Carter Johnson. - Carter Johnson? - GEORGE: I meant to tell you. They picked him up on Friday from the Ellerbee case. [SIGHS] We've been retained. [DOOR BUZZES] [♪♪♪] [CLEARS THROAT] [DOOR BANGS, BUZZES] Hello, Carter. I'm George Pierce, and this is my associate Roman Israel. Roman is a devoted advocate and a fabulous attorney. And he's gonna be the point person on your team. - You're good, huh? - Well, he's better than good. Have you had a chance to review the fee structure? - The stuff you sent over? Yeah. - Yeah. You understand this is a capital murder case? - Yeah. - All right, first off, you wanna be fully up to speed on your file. You will make better decisions if you're completely informed about every aspect of your case and you know all your options. I know all my options. Well, unfortunately, we, uh, can't change what's been done. That means facing this head-on. [VOICE RECEDING FAINTLY] I think you understand the penalties you're facing are very severe. [IN NORMAL VOICE] In overview, we're gonna study the discovery of the evidence the prosecution gives us. And we're gonna force the prosecution to give us anything and everything we want. - Roman, you wanna step in? - Yeah, we're gonna... We're gonna perform a private investigation, and, uh... devise a defense. That's not all we'll do. We'll outwork the prosecution. All right? We're gonna outwork them, we're gonna outperform them. And we're gonna get you the best result possible. Life in a cage. Well, that's the outcome we're fighting. It'll be a long process, and it's gonna cost quite a bit. So with that in mind, I... I'd like to suggest there's no need for two billable attorneys at this early phase. If it's okay with you, I'll bow out. I'll let Roman continue. It's okay with me. All right, Carter. I'll be in touch. Roman, I'll speak with you later. Okay. GEORGE: Guard. The, um... [DOOR BUZZES] - Uh... - [DOOR CLOSES] The prosecutors are gonna favor a grand jury over a preliminary hearing, which will allow them to wait and reveal the evidence at the trial. You represented Derrell. Uh, briefly. I asked for you after talking to his cellie. We have a number of legal maneuvers we can employ, to try and force a prelim. - I don't care about the prelim. - I'd advise that we pursue it. You knew where I was. When was that? Before they picked me up. I'm sure Derrell shared that info with a number of people. No. You're the only person he told. That's what he told the guy. You called it in, collected the reward money. - You fucked me. - I presented myself... on your request for an attorney. You're talking, but it don't mean nothing. I ain't never getting out of here. They got me cold. I'll tell you this. I got you. Anytime I want. - Guard... Guard. - Any place. - Guard! - Could've already done it. - Guard. - But I want you to be where I am. - Guard! - Thinking about it. Guard. Go on and tell somebody what you did. - I want out. - Broke your own law. - Privileged information. - Guard! Tell them about the law you broke. They'll throw you in here with me. But you're gonna run. Try it. [♪♪♪] [TIRES SQUEALING] [SIREN WAILING] [♪♪♪] - You know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah. - Mr. Burton, how are you? - How you doin'? WOMAN: Come this way.

MAYA: You'd tell me if I was bugging you. No. MAYA [LAUGHS]: Well, that's honest. You know I only call you when I'm down. That's horrible, right? One of my friends... One of my best staffers quit on me yesterday. Told me that working here was just for his résumé. Yeah... The ability to have, uh... conflicting ideas in one's head takes effort. MAYA [LAUGHS]: I like that. How's your day going? Uh, you know... life smiles, I smile back. MAYA [LAUGHS]: You don't sound like you're smiling. I'm a little... Kind of anxious, actually. MAYA: Well, just tell yourself that most of the things you worry about will never, ever happen. I'll try that. MAYA [SCOFFS]: Alcohol works even better. - Roman? - Yeah. MAYA: It's a really bad connection. Where are you? In a desert. MAYA: Yeah, it feels like that sometimes. Just gotta keep moving. Well which way? MAYA [LAUGHS]: Head on. Just straight through. [LINE CRACKLES] - Hello? - MAYA: Roman? - Hey, can you hear...? - Hello? Maya? [PHONE SNAPS SHUT] [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] ROMAN: Soulful action affects the course of law. It's called to account the original complaint. The agents have changed, united by virtue. Wrongs will be righted. The loophole of ambiguity in the system... Legal challenge based on improvement... Revised draft of a new community unevenly applied... Reverted to history, formally empowering authority. Levels of the law. There needs to be a bottom-up legal change. Who'll see us? What the world could be, not what it is. Society is something to be invented, not endured. Must stand, or go down together. [KNOCKS] Hey, Roman. What are you doing? [CHOIR VOCALIZING] [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] ROMAN: Case 00-001. Supreme Court of Absolute Universal Law. Los Angeles division. Roman J. Israel, Esquire, petitioner versus himself, defendant. Notice. To permanently disbar Roman J. Israel, Esquire from the California Bar and human race for being a hypocrite and turning his back on everything he ever claimed to actually stand for... [DOOR OPENS] Hey. I just heard something disturbing about you from a solid source. About the Ellerbee case. Carter Johnson? You collected the reward? Is that true? ROMAN: ...in the city of Los Angeles. - During that time... - FRITZ: Roman. [INDISTINCT OVERLAPPING THOUGHTS] ...for the above-mentioned request for immediate and summary judgment. JESSIE: I thought we were working tonight. Uh, I plan to leave. Monday, then? Tomorrow? I believe I'll be unavailable for the foreseeable future. You know the facts. - Just jump in. - You mean, on my own? You got it. [♪♪♪] [CARS HONKING] Did you check his office? FRITZ [ON PHONE]: That's what I'm saying, he left already. - When? - MAN: A few minutes ago. Goddamn it, he's not answering his cell. Just keep trying him and let me know, all right? Roman. Roman! [BRAKES SQUEAL] [GRUNTS] - [PIANO PLAYING] - [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] - MAYA: Okay. - Yeah, I'm back. - What is that? - That's for you. - It's a bulldog. - Amongst other things. - It's so real. - It actually is alive. Why are you giving it to me? To take care of. [LAUGHS] You're a trip. Well, you're worth having this thing. Here. Put it up here. - Is it yours? - For a while. Well, then you should keep it, Roman. Well, I don't have room. - In your apartment. - I gave it up. Why? I'm going away. Where? Wherever they send me. See, something has occurred. Something... I've just taken a career which was certainly sincere and... And well-intentioned and launched it right into the realm of the truly transformational. I promise you that the attorney that triumphs in this instance won't be the one with the most formal education or legal skill. Roman, what are you talking about? Well, it's quite interesting, actually. - There you are. - Hey, George. This is Maya. Maya, this is George. - Hey. - Hello. Maya doesn't overlook the vital things... like other people. And speaking for myself, I'm thankful for that. Roman tells me that he really enjoys working for you. Yeah. George is a protector of rights. That's truth - in advertising. - I... I need to... I need to have a word with you. Can we...? - I was leaving anyway. - You just got here. GEORGE: Sorry, Maya, it's, uh... It's important. This is funny. Just to think... Three Mondays ago, I didn't know either one of you. - Roman, I'm concerned about you. - ROMAN: It's okay. George and I just need to... - talk business matters. - Yeah. I believe... the two of you are gonna... get along very well. Roman... Roman. Roman, wait. [SIGHS] Roman... what the hell is going on? From my point of view? I get a call from Fritz. Says he has reliable information that you turned in Carter Johnson, collected the reward. Here's what the prosecutor won't tell you. Jesus Christ, it's true. I've been given a gift, George. No, you acted utterly improperly. I mean, you broke the law. It so wasn't a gift, Roman. I'm not talking about the money. I don't care about the money, fruit of the poisonous tree. If you wanna understand what's happening, you're gonna have get past all the smoke of legal disputation. Legal disputation? Roman, these are dangerous people. You don't just walk away from this. Not walking away. I'm turning myself in. The station's on Sixth. Roman. I'll... I'll walk with you. You know, all those years of practicing... scouring law books... achieving technical triumphs through loopholes and ambiguities... [CHUCKLES] none of which were adequate to save me from the reality of my present situation. Then today, in the middle of nowhere... lost, had a revelation. An insight so sweeping, so clear. It's me, George. See, I didn't see it before because I never experienced the other side. I'm the defendant... and the plaintiff simultaneously. I file against myself, I represent myself, I convict myself, hereby expanding the full scope of the legal desert because the judgment's built in. The only thing left is forgiveness, and I grant that to myself. An act doesn't make the person guilty unless the mind is guilty as well. [CHUCKLES] Of course... Of course I expect there'll be challenges, as there's no precedent or derivative interpretations, but the argument is sound. The premise true. I have no doubt it'll be upheld by any and all courts of law. You're insane. Never been more clear. - That's what we'll argue. - Now, watch what you say. You don't represent me, so the rules of confidentiality don't apply. My entire defense will be based on the unequivocal recitation of the truth. I know you get it, George. You have such a tremendous future. It's so bright, I... I swear, it's.... [CHUCKLES] It's blinding. [TIRES SQUEAL, HORN HONKS] Jesus.

ROMAN: To whom it may concern, I'm returning the reward money. Taking it was wrong, and I'm compelled to remedy my mistake. I did spend $5,547.27, which I will repay. I bought three suits, size 50 regular. And I did buy two pairs of Italian loafers, size 11. One black, one brown. [♪♪♪] We were all formed of frailty and error.
