A little girl coming in, a third grader, covered in dirt, has one flip-flop, the other one busted on the way in-- this was January. I could call her mom and say, you know, where's her shoes? Be mad and call 241-KIDS and say this is neglect, or I could just find a way to get this girl a shoe. I want to do something that's much, much different than probably a lot of principals. I want the boards to come down off the houses. I want less crime and people from outside our community coming in and selling drugs. I want to start working on the neighborhood, the streets. Hey. I've got three young ladies who won't be able to start school till Monday. Why's that? Whooping cough. All three of them? They live in here? Yeah. And they got the cough? Yep. Keep them there till the cough's done. John, you're trying to hide from me. Yes, you are. Come here. You are hiding from me, and I know exactly why. I'm not hiding from you. You look like a zombie. You need to come into school. All right? I mean it. Are you well enough to come into school. You only need five credits. I just scoped it out. We want to try to find a way how we can stop this and make the streets better. I don't think it's far off. I mean, I think it's very doable. I'm excited about it. I've got 184 more days to go. Good morning. We're all a little lost here aren't, aren't we? K to six, line up right here, high school on the far door, seventh and eighth grade over here. Today's going to be crazy getting used to the new building. But we'll get it. Each day will get better and better, OK? Brand new building, brand new door, brand new entrance, everything. Exciting. Straight to the cafeteria, good job. Today is a monumental day. We were moved out of our community for the first time in almost 100 years while they renovated and added new construction to our building. Today was the first day that we have been back in over two very long years. Even before this, we tried to do a lot of stuff to brighten it up. It was a very gloomy place. It was a very gloomy place. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. high school. Is that this way? I have no idea. I don't even know. Me neither. Lower Price Hill is a predominately poor Lower Price Hill is a predominately poor white Appalachian community. white Appalachian community. When the coal mines and the jobs left in Kentucky, West Virginia, a lot of the families migrated to the urban centers to get jobs. There were hundreds of jobs and factories around here. A lot of those are gone now. It's kind of become an economic desert. I can walk you outside the door not even 15 steps away, and I can probably get just about any drug that I want. and I can probably get just about any drug that I want. I can walk you another 15 feet down, I can walk you another 15 feet down, and there are our parents that are prostituting and are hooked on heroin and crack cocaine. Assault out on Hatmaker, right now. Who? I don't know. Cops are there. Was it in that house on the right? Mhm. That's something we've got to think about, make sure we. Lots to do today. We're in this brand new building. We're riding a high. Students walking around still in awe. Mr. Hockenberry got some correspondence from the state, a letter that said from the state, a letter that said we have been identified as a priority school which we have been identified as a priority school which means that we are in the bottom 5% of schools in the state as it relates to academic performance. And then we keep reading. We have to choose one of five models for school We have to choose one of five models for school transformation. transformation. Four out of the five models say replace the principal. Up these steps, all right? And then the teachers will be right up top there. And then the teachers will be right up top there. The fifth model is don't replace the principal, The fifth model is don't replace the principal, but you have to show a proven track but you have to show a proven track record of academic achievement. record of academic achievement. And that's what we're hoping for. My initial reaction was this will go away. My initial reaction was this will go away. The further away from where you are, the worse we look.

When people see the real work that's going on, When people see the real work that's going on, we look absolutely fantastic. we look absolutely fantastic. Hi! Welcome back. Yay, yay, yay, yay. My name is Raven Gribbins. I am in the 12th grade. I've lived in Lower Price Hill my whole life. It's been rough, but it's been OK too. Everybody used to tell me, you're not going to make it through high school. You're going to have a baby by 16. So I'm glad to prove all of them wrong. job after graduation because I'm going to college. OK. Hi. Hi, I'm Stephanie. Stephanie, so nice to meet you. Hi. Crystal. Crystal, so nice to meet you.

I did not come out of the womb knowing I did not come out of the womb knowing how to eat at a business lunch. how to eat at a business lunch. That doesn't happen. What you want to do is you want to maintain a professional decorum, OK? I've been attending Oyler since the second grade. Say you drop a knife. Do not panic. You're at a restaurant. They have lots of knives. They have lots of knives. Sometimes you've got to fight back Sometimes you've got to fight back because if you don't, you will wind up because if you don't, you will wind up like the people around you. like the people around you. Well, the most important thing you can do is just be your best self. I just want to leave and do some new travel, be the oddball. Everybody look at their fingernails. Clean fingernails. Ladies, fingernail polish. Any questions? Any more questions? Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Good morning. This is my 14th year here. When I first started, I did everything. If a little girl came in and she had head lice, I scrubbed her hair. If a boy came in and he had a peanut allergy, I hit him with the epi-pen. Mountain Dew in the morning, sir? Don't think so. If you would've been here three years ago, the floors were black, hard concrete, no air conditioning. The lockers were old. The restrooms were horrid. It was terrible. We tried to create this vision of a one-stop shop, where we have services from 5:30 in the morning until 10:30 at night. So if a parent walks through our door right now So if a parent walks through our door right now and has a child that sick, needs glasses, and has a child that sick, needs glasses, and has a child that sick, needs glasses, and has a mental health issue, we and has a mental health issue, we can just walk them to the different areas of our school, can just walk them to the different areas of our school, and then get the child back in a seat. and then get the child back in a seat. In theory, there should be no kid not getting full services In theory, there should be no kid not getting full services here, you know? here, you know? And if they're not, then we're going to address it pretty quickly. We have probably one of the largest tutoring programs We have probably one of the largest tutoring programs here in the Midwest that has over 400 mentors. here in the Midwest that has over 400 mentors. Well done. We have the early childhood wing, which then makes our school from zero to five all the way to 12th grade. In order to revitalize the school, you have to go hand in hand with revitalizing the neighborhood. Is it just you? Yeah, just me. OK. If someone from the community needs something, the only thing they have to do is come to the school building. Here you go. Have a good one. God bless you. You too. Thank you. I got my help. How was your day at school? It was good. You have any homework? Yes, I do. So you going to do your homework? Yes, I'll do it. I want to make something with my life. If my mom and dad would've had a high school diploma, their life would be way different now. My mom, she was in and out of jail a lot. She had a drug problem. She used to prostitute also. I talk to her every once in a while. I don't know what's going on now. My father, he could not read or write, so that's what messed him up. I'm a maintenance man. I do construction. Not having an education, sometimes work's hard to find. You struggle. I had moved in with my dad because of a lot of problems that had been going on in Lower Price Hill. She wanted to come up and stay to get away from State Avenue because it was getting a little rough, a little violent. I lived up here, and it's a little quieter. This is mine and my little sister's room. We share. We kind of had growing up a rocky relationship, and I got hooked on cocaine pretty bad and alcohol. And they took Raven away from me. My mother and father raised her for me. My mother and father raised her for me. But now it's a date, and I'm clean and sober. But now it's a date, and I'm clean and sober. I got a second chance and an opportunity I got a second chance and an opportunity to spend this last year with her. to spend this last year with her. to spend this last year with her. She's going to graduate from high school. She's going to graduate from high school. She's going to graduate from high school. Hopefully she'll go to college. Hopefully she'll go to college. Hopefully she'll go to college. I mean, I'm really hoping. I mean, I'm really hoping. I mean, I'm really hoping. She says she is. She says she is. But I hope she at least gives it a chance. Why'd you make that face? Because I'm going to go to college so I can have a better life than they had. Don, what's going on, buddy? I got them doing a little story on the school, just walking the neighborhood. That's all right. Yeah, we're doing OK. Yeah, we're doing OK. I grew up a block away at 2125 St. Michael Street. I grew up a block away at 2125 St. Michael Street. I want to Oyler kindergarten through sixth grade. When I was growing up, the ladies, they'd When I was growing up, the ladies, they'd hit this sidewalk about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evenings hit this sidewalk about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evenings when the sun would go down, and it when the sun would go down, and it would be coffee and cigarettes and Pepsi and gossip. would be coffee and cigarettes and Pepsi and gossip. These women were always out, keeping an eye on things and running this place. I never feel as good as I do when I'm standing right here in front of 21 25 St. Michael Street. I probably never will. I consider us a close knit community. Families that have been here for a long time have married other families that have been here for a long time. So there's a lot of, oh, that's my daughter-in-law's family, or that's my son-in-law's family. I've lived in this neighborhood 52 years. I've lived in this neighborhood 52 years. There's times around here when things aren't going very good, There's times around here when things aren't going very good, There's times around here when things aren't going very good, but you always seem to find somebody but you always seem to find somebody who can lean on and talk to. Times are getting hard, and without an education, a lot of people aren't going to make it. Thank you. Oyler began as only at pre-K to sixth school, then they added the seventh, and they added the eighth grade. Over time, we had saw an ugly pattern developing. 85.9% of the kids that left here never 85.9% of the kids that left here never made it to a 10th grade seat. made it to a 10th grade seat. made it to a 10th grade seat. It was very shocking to me, because every opening day It was very shocking to me, because every opening day outside my building were 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 kids that should be in high school. So it kind of sparked an idea to say, So it kind of sparked an idea to say, could we have a high school here? could we have a high school here? could we have a high school here? When my own children were going to school here, When my own children were going to school here, When my own children were going to school here, when they got to high school or junior high, when they got to high school or junior high, when they got to high school or junior high, they were being bused to other high schools. they were being bused to other high schools. And that was hard on them. And that was hard on them. They say that they were bullied on by other students. They say that they were bullied on by other students. Faculty wouldn't do anything to help them, to make it stop. My kids, they would beat me back to the neighborhood. You know, I'd get a call. Your kids aren't in school. I just dropped them off. So when I went to Taft High School, there was only 43 white people in the whole school. They didn't like us. We didn't like them. Now times have changed. The prejudice is still there, but it's not as strong as it was back in the '80s and the '90s. We're starting our eighth year as a high school. We have graduated more kids in the past three years than in the collective 85 years prior. For a lot of our kids, they have grown up here. For a lot of our kids, they have grown up here. They have started here as kindergartners, They have started here as kindergartners, and they're going to be walking out the doors as high school graduates. All right, let's set the tone from the very first play. 1, 2, fire it up! Come on! Come on! Let's go! No, no, no, play within the game. No, no, no, play within the game. You hear me? You hear me? Hey, are you guys still were you're supposed to be? Yeah. All right. Before the high school started, we had zero students graduating. And the fact that we're graduating And the fact that we're graduating almost upwards of 40 or 50 kids a year now almost upwards of 40 or 50 kids a year now is an accomplishment to us. But the state has accountability measures, and we're responsible for meeting those. So that's how we fell into that-- they're So that's how we fell into that-- they're calling it a priority category. calling it a priority category. We were in there because our graduation rate was below 60%. They were basing the graduation rate on a four-year model. They were basing the graduation rate on a four-year model. So when a kid comes in the ninth grade, So when a kid comes in the ninth grade, he's got four years to graduate. If it takes him five, he's a dropout. There's one right there. He saw me and took off. Stop, stop, stop. Gentlemen, I know where you go to school, and I know where you live. As we move forward through the school year, As we move forward through the school year, we still have to show some kind of academic change. we still have to show some kind of academic change. Office-- Alex Chapman just took off running from me through an alley. Could you contact his father and let him know he's skipping? He's also got somebody else with him. You take your eye off the ball for one minute in Lower Price Hill, one minute, and you lose. Hey, Donna Jones, we're doing an attendance sweep. If you see any skippers, let me know. $5-- viaduct. That's where I've seen them all yesterday. On the viaduct? I didn't think of that. Let's turn around. Yeah. Go back. I thought about that. I didn't even think of that. Is it they're under here? Right there. Yep. How'd they get in? Go right. Go right. OK. Faster. You hit it. All righty, Mr. Mitchell. Guys, come on. I know every corner, every inch of this place, all right? Do you guys understand it? And I'm going to catch you every single time you do it. We're in the area of the city where there is quite a bit of pollution. The pollution coming from cars, coming from factories is an easy thing to think of. At first, I wanted to switch schools, but because this was the closest school, but because this was the closest school, my parents wanted me to come here. my parents wanted me to come here. At first I didn't like it, but I got used to it. I want to say it was like the fourth, like-- The second, the second. My booty is there. I've been there. Me and him, me and him, we talked to people, and they didn't want to talk to us. We still talked to them. It took about a month for them to say, It took about a month for them to say, either those people don't know where they're at, either those people don't know where they're at, or those people just got to fit in, and that's how it was. Mhm. I've got a spike. Are you Crystal? Yep. How's it going? Good. Good. Good. Is that for us? Is that for us? Is that for us? Mhm. Mhm. Awesome. Come on back here. My name is Mary. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Hi, Crystal. Hey. How are you? Good. Good. So today I'm going to check your eyes and see how they work and what's going on. So you're a senior? Yes. What's coming up next? College. Oh good. What are you going to study, do you know? Criminal justice. Wow, good. All right, so start by looking to the green animal here. Hey, Raven, how are you? Good, how are you? Dr. , nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. OK, now watch this here. You see that animal? Can you tell what it is? The cat. Mhm. So you do have migraines it looks like. Do you get headaches after you read, though? Sometimes. Do you enjoy reading? Nope. OK. You're a senior this year, right? And are you plan to go to school next year? Mhm. Where are you looking at going to school? I want to go to Mount St. Joseph. Oh nice. So you'd be close by. To be a math teacher. Wow! OK. That's awesome. Move,. I've known Raven her entire life. She is hard headed. She is also highly intelligent, highly motivated. I worry about her. I worry about all of them. I worry about all of them. She's the epitome of what our young ladies go through She's the epitome of what our young ladies go through down here. One day she might have her drug addicted aunt's kids, taking care of them. The next day, she'll be here playing basketball just like a normal high school student in anytown, USA. What scares me is that if she gets an opportunity to go away to college, will she take it? Because you always feel like you're being pulled back in to your family's drama. Guys, we need a little bit more space. It was the first varsity game. The place was sold out. The coach wasn't the head coach. He was just stepping in. 1, 2, 3, work hard, play hard! Hey, know who we've got! So Raven dropped off two tickets, one for her boyfriend and one for her father. He never showed. I don't think her boyfriend shown either, which caused her and the coach to have some issues. Two of them got into it. Staying out of trouble. That's going to be the biggest one. I'm used to speaking my mind. I'm used to speaking my mind. But when you speak your mind, sometimes that But when you speak your mind, sometimes that gets you in trouble. I was feisty. I always have an attitude at some point in time. Get her, Raven, get her! Growing up, was a really rough neighborhood. It was one of the roughest in Cincinnati. We were raised to fight. This girl, she kept calling me all types of bad name, saying I sucked up the whole football team. I told her, I said, look, you're either I told her, I said, look, you're either going to have to stop talking about me, going to have to stop talking about me, or we're going to have to fight. And somebody ended up recording it and put it on YouTube. I only got to play like two minutes because he was so mad. When you're mad, you can't just start yelling. I am Raven's mentor here from Oyler. I mean, just think, if you were to yell like that at your boss and you lose your job-- I see her about two to three times a month, and we text on a regular basis. Try and take a deep breath and just remove yourself from the situation is the best advice. We went to a lunch. It was designed to be a business lunch. Club with no tomato. That's her. Thank you. Do we have to eat our stuff-- our fries with a fork? My major focus with her so far has been I don't want to let her down. Because of her mother being out of her life for so much when I tell her I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it. Look, it's beeping because I don't have my seat belt on. No, it's beeping because I'm just getting really close to the car behind it. I thought everybody was going to be real, real dressed up, so when I came in pants, I was like, I'm going to be the only person with pants on. I thought that too. Oh no. Did you hear about the shooting that happened on the west side Friday night? Oh yeah. After the game? It was during the game too. That's crazy. Because the game was sold out. This is what I heard. The game was sold out. They were mad they couldn't get in, so they started shooting because they couldn't get in. That is crazy! Yeah. They started shooting because they couldn't get in the game. Yeah! I have never heard of nothing like that. Hi, everybody. Hi, Mr. Hockenberry. Hey. - Mr. Hockenberry. - classes. We left for two years, pulled out all the services, and went up to Price Hill. We leave, and there's nothing to do. Shot right there, and came out there. You know what I told her about not being in school and hanging out any everything? Almost every night, there was a shooting. There was a rape. There was a drug overdose. So there was absolutely nothing going on, and I think that leads to bad, bad decisions. My son-in-law's brother was murdered. This was Brian's house, the boy that was murdered. Brian Thompson was a student here, and his son Brian is now a student. From what I understand, it was just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was a craps game going on over here in the water park. One guy lost several hundred dollars in the game, so he called his friends and said, let's rob this guy, get my $200 back. And they shoot the guy. They take the money. Brian had just pulled up. He had his hands up in the car, and they came right this way and just-- he wouldn't get out of the car, and they just unloaded fire and shot him and killed him on the face. All right, guys, let's go! Out of the park. Mr. Wynn. There was a triple shooting up on Price Hill last night. There was a triple shooting up on Price Hill last night. You stay out of that stuff, you hear me? You stay out of that stuff, you hear me? can go there, and that's can go there, and that's where you take your library classes. where you take your library classes. where you take your library classes. you can come here, and I'll help you directly do that, you can come here, and I'll help you directly do that, but it's going to be. So far, the school year, it feels like it's gone by really fast. I have been applying to colleges like Kent State, UC, Miami, and other colleges. So can I put that in this one? Yeah. Like, attending University of Cincinnati would help me accomplish one of my goals. Yeah, good. When I came to Oyler, there was like this complete absence of college. It's not a dinner table topic. It's not a dinner table topic. I said, one day a year, every year from here on out I said, one day a year, every year from here on out I said, one day a year, every year from here on out for as long as I'm principal, we'll for as long as I'm principal, we'll do our one day where that's all we talk about is college. When we think about colleges, what do we think about first? Marshall? We can't start talking to students from a school in an area like this when they're sophomores and juniors about going to college. You have to plant that seed early. They have to believe it and believe it and believe it. Because the sad truth is, not only are they not hearing it at home, they may be hearing the opposite at home. You're not going to go to college. You're no better than me. What makes you think you can go to college? Nobody from our family's ever gone to college? Why am I showing you Hocking College? Because last year, Ashley Ward, she graduated from our high school. And she is now at Hocking college. This is direct evidence that if you graduate high school from Oyler, you can go to college. You can succeed. Someone has to be the one to break that cycle of not being educated and living in poverty. And our students here at Oyler are doing that. We have first generation college students coming out of our high school every year. --very interested. I'm Crystal. Abby, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I got accepted to Mount St. Joseph. OK. And they were telling me about their different scholarships they have to offer. The amount of money that you receive, does it-- like it depends on your GPA and ACT scores or just based on one? Both of those combined. Triangle inequality. Absolute value of x minus 2 plus the absolute value-- Hi, Raven, I'm Abby. Hi-- So good to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Hi, I'm Caitlin. I'm her former college access advisor. OK, very nice to meet you. She submitted an application, right? Mhm. And with an ACT score from last year, right? Mhm. And so she's wondering-- what did you get on it last year? 16. Our average score is a 22, but by no means does that mean that everybody in that range, above that range, gets in. There's people below that that also get in. Can you tell me a little bit about your GPA and where you're at in school right now? My GPA is a 2.3. OK. But it's going up, though, because I've got straight A's and B's right now. You do? That's good. Yes, so it's going up. Because they're making funding decisions right now, so you want to make sure you get this in before for they decide about funding. I could do that. OK. Maybe. Maybe? Just kidding. I'm listening. Just because I'm playing a game-- I'm listening. I just like to check. Sometimes when you guys are like texting and playing games, you're listening and sometimes you're not. Ms. Burns, who you waiting on? You all right? Yeah. All right. Something's going on here we don't know about. We've got kids that haven't shown up in 100 days, 50 days, 60 days. They're not going to show up on testing day, so they're going to have an impact on some of our scores. The big elephant in the room is the attendance. Attendance. That's going to have to be a top priority because it is getting low. And it is hard to teach with six kids in a classroom or 10 kids in a classroom. So we have to make sure-- But it's not a problem we haven't ever dealt with before, right? I mean, every year we've got that mid-year attendance issue with the juniors and seniors, and every year we get them back. Craig has just done so much for this community, and he deserves to be able to stay in the position that he's in. He has such an enormous vision for the neighborhood. Why would that not be supported? Why would that not be supported? OK. Just leave them here. I have the directions here. Well, you know, it's very complicated. I'll put it together in just a minute. I'm basically on call 24 hours a day. I mean, any given moment, I could be working till midnight and up by 5 o'clock. So it's constant, around the clock. All right, not crank it. Keep cranking. Like this? Oohh. As long as it doesn't leak out anywhere. I know how to do this, but-- What are you doing? When I first saw him, I knew that there was something different about him. Do you want me to open it for you? Yeah. And I told him from the very beginning, you are destined to change lives. I think because he is beyond passionate, it's hard not to be supportive because what he does is just so admirable. Sometimes I have to literally tell him to turn, take his face out of his "CrackBerry," and give me some face time. If you're not busy, try not to stab me. Oh, I think I want to try to stab you a little bit. OK. OK. Here we go. Ow. All right. It's great. Great. Apparently I'm the king of Price Hill for this year. Happy Thanksgiving! I grew up in a beautiful small town in Northeastern Ohio. Hi! Hi! How are you? How are you? It was a very rural community. It was in those days when you could just walk out the door in the morning, be gone until 6:00, 7 o'clock at night, and my parents never even blinked an eye if I was safe or not. Happy Thanksgiving! Happy Thanksgiving! Probably the exact opposite of. Happy-- Happy Thanksgiving! You're sleepy, aren't you? You sleepy? My dad's girlfriend Jessica, she had my baby brother. He was like three weeks early. Can you hand me that red cover right there? She had a drug problem. She would do something here and there, and that's the reason why the baby had to stay in the hospital an extra week. He's almost up to seven pounds now. But she's been clean ever since then, and she's doing good. My dad and the way he chooses to have his kids is just real crazy. I've got 10-year-old sisters, then I've got a two-year-old sister, and now I've got a new baby brother, so we've got to be 17 years apart. got a new baby brother, so we've got to be 17 years apart. Oh, no, you're going to be a crybaby today. Oh, no, you're going to be a crybaby today. Happy, happy birthday. Hey! Happy, happy birthday from Applebee's to you! Happy birthday! Thank you! It's been a tough past two weeks, and I don't anticipate it getting any easier over the next few weeks. One of our parents of three children was shot and killed last night. She was having some problems with drugs. Unfortunately, this is something we're good at responding about. I'd rather be good at responding to football games and basketball games. There was a little note in there. She wrote, I love you, Mom. I'll miss you, Mom. Here's a book to read in heaven. I'm going to drag those three kids across the finish line, no matter what happens. Hey, Eric, how you feeling, man? I'm all right. Good. I'm really sorry about what happened, man. It's all right. I'm really sorry. And you know, I needed you at school today. You gonna be there tomorrow for me, for tomorrow? I'll try. All right. This is two people, friends that I've lost to gun violence in this neighborhood. When is it gonna frickin' stop? serious measures. I want him explaining this. Is Coach Lazar up here? Coach is. I saw half of you outside. There was a fight that was going to happen after school. Not one person that was in that fight had anything to do with any of you guys. Not one of them talked about your moms. Not one of them hit you. Not one of them stole your girlfriend. Now there's three police cars out there, asking about my basketball team. Dequann, they're saying it was you. They're out there looking for you. I asked if I could handle it myself. You're his brother! Don't let him do that stuff! Tackle him. Drag him in here. Tie him to something. This is our only chance that we have to be winners. You guys fought every game last year. You were an embarrassment. And now nobody can beat us because everybody's playing together. But one problem throws everything off. When a fight breaks out, people lose their lives. One wrong move in this neighborhood, and you're not going to college. 1, 2, 3,! Let's go now. Let's go! All right. Nobody goes on the court. Got you. Nobody. OK. Black, Gold, Black, Gold, Black, Gold, Black, Gold! O, O, O, O, O, O! I don't want to play them again. I do not want to play them in the tournament. I need a year off from Riverview East. The feeble fictional creatures and animals that are Yep. Yep, that's it. The climax. There's a level of concern right now about how our scores will be. We haven't thrown in the towel yet by any means, but we're definitely right now fighting an uphill battle. There is a lot of pressure on teachers for test scores. We spend a lot of time preparing our children. Some of our children are very far behind. Based on factual events. Which one of these is based on factual events? Don't even tell me, nobody. Sometimes it feels unfair to be measured in the same way as other schools in the state. That's right. Good job. Exactly. The human part of me that comes in here every day and sees what these students are trying to do every day and sees what these families are trying to accomplish every day says, this isn't fair. Their performance on those tests are going to determine whether or not the state believes that we have improved enough to keep our principal. See you, everybody. I'll be back. Penn, they sent me an email saying that they're looking for new players, that they really hope I'll come out on the recruit day and try out. It's good, but I'm scared I'm going to get out there and like freeze up or something. I really like Raven. She's very positive. I think she knows what she wants. I actually used a recruiting website and saw that she was a setter. She had high school experience and just reached out her to see what her interest level might be, to see if there's any chance that we would be a good fit for her. You guys ready? I really in my heart believe that Raven will be one of the students who breaks away from this neighborhood a little bit, gets herself an education. I don't see any reason why she can't. So the summer program is basically free if you're going into engineering? If you're interested in one of those fields, right. To me-- I like this place. --this place fits you. I think it would be good for me. And it's all right here, Raven. You're not going anywhere. You're not going to get lost. It's all right here. OK, good job. All right. Whenever you have a question and they talk about describing, go back to that section and just start circling words that describe stuff and see which ones match. And that way you can kind of save some time. It'll make it more like a direct answer. So how are you feeling about it? I'm ready to. You're ready? Yeah, you're going to be awesome. OK. I think I did better on this one than any other one. I mean, I just tried my best. If it doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out. Nobody is happy about non-renewing valued administrators, especially our principals who are on the front line. We have been in a budget crisis really for several years, and this year is a particularly bad one. We need to preserve all of the options to close that really huge gap. All of the administrators, both at the school level and at the district level, whose contracts end this July, have gotten non-renewal letters. Everyone's jobs are on the line. It doesn't matter what the state says. Everyone still might not have a job, and that includes me. Yesterday I got non-renewed. It was a blanket non-renewal, so they non-renewed a lot of principals throughout the district. "Dear Mr. Hockenberry, thanks for your service. In ordinance with the high revise code, this is to inform you that your administrative contract expires and your services will no longer be needed." You know, it happened once before in my career. We found out the very next day we all got brought back. But regardless, whatever happens, one dead monkey don't stop the circus down here at Oyler, and it's a good school. Miss Glott, or anybody with a radio, come in, please. Could you ask them if they could spot check Hatmaker Street, just so it looks nice? And if anybody else can lend a helping hand, that would be great. I love you. Be careful. I love you too! Be careful. Mr. Hockenberry's got some friends coming in to check out how smart we are, what a great job we've been doing at Oyler. I expect nothing but your best behavior. They're flying in from Washington, DC. Whoa! And some other parts of the country. Double check the spelling of Weingartner by looking her up on the internet not my sheet. It's fantastic! All right. Welcome to Oyler, the pride of Cincinnati Public. All right? Thank you. Thank you. And everybody else, welcome. But yeah, I'm looking for an assistant superintendent job, so if you need anything, let me know. I will pack up-- Let me explain something to you. We'd be happy to talk to you. Just shoot me an email. Yeah, I will. And I'll drop you my resume. OK. And things like that. Great. This is fantastic. I feel like we'll go do a ton of things together on this. Thank you for making us come. Thank you for. Absolutely. All right, Raven. I'm gonna take a few here. 1, 2, 3. OK, so what are you leaning to? NKU. Well,. Goodbye. Northern Kentucky University. So it's a done deal, right? All right. That's great. like this? All right. I like this. This is cute. Do you have favorite colors? Either pink, black, or blue. Pink and gray? No? OK. You want to try that one? Yeah. OK. I want to try every dress there is here. Can you kind of turn from one side to the other Can you kind of turn from one side to the other and see what? and see what? Cute! Now we have to walk around in them. Three people asked me, but I don't know who to pick yet. "Dear Raven, on behalf of the College of Mount St. Joseph, I am pleased to inform you that you have been accepted as a student beginning 2013 fall." All right, now we've got to open the big, big one. OK. "Congratulations. I am pleased to offer you admission to the College of Education for fall 2013 at Penn State Greater Allegheny." Four years ago, if I would have told myself that I was going to Penn State for volleyball and stuff like that, I would have been like, you're crazy. I would never believe it because I was being bad. I always got suspended. I wasn't doing my work. I was always skipping school, so I would never have believed it in a million years. I am a proud graduate of the College of Mount St. Joe. But the truth be told, I barely made it to the Mount. I was 46 out of 52 in my class ranking. I finished with a 1.9 GPA. I scored a 9 on my ACT, and I didn't even show up for my scheduled SAT test. As the final days of school came to an end, I was called to the principal's office. I was greeted by a man dressed in a suit, wearing the largest ring I'd ever seen. The man turned out to be a coach. He had just been hired by the Mount to coach the first ever football team. Essentially, I was given a chance, one that would be taken away if my grades didn't align with the Mount's standards. I'm going to remind you all, every principal's worst nightmare, that we wake up tomorrow morning and something bad happened. So please, help each other out. Make sure you make the right decisions. And I will be at the after party. I heard where it is. I will be there. I can't wait. I want to see you there. Raven, it was really, really exciting to have Raven. Because I remember Raven as a five, six-year-old. I'm so proud of this girl. It's amazing to see what you're doing. You're raising the standards for your entire family, honey. And we're all so proud of you. Get up here, because I have to stop now. What's up, Nate? How you doing? Good. Graduation tonight. Okey dokey. Big party, big party on State Street. All righty! She forgot to come to school this morning. Oh. Who suspended you? Me? It looks like they brought me back, so we're moving in the right direction. I did, indeed, find out this week that I was coming back. It wasn't real fun, I can tell you that. It was a tough time. But it seems like things are moving in a very good direction. And by the time negotiations are over, I think everything will be working out really well. I'm looking forward to it. I was a little confused at the salary. My pay was $10,000 less. This job's hard enough doing around the clock work. I haven't had a pay raise in six, seven years as it is. Hats aren't really hair friendly. They really aren't. I can't believe I'm not going to see you every day. You know, I remember coming here when we only had two graduates at Oyler, and here I am six years later, and there's 50 names on this list. So this really is fabulous. And you're one of the 50 fabulous, so congratulations. Thank you. I'm playing volley ball for Penn State. Wow. Did they give you a scholarship? They gave me $4,000 this year, but next year I'll be able to get more. Wonderful. Today's my favorite day of the year. It's the day that every single child at Oyler is working for, from the six week old infants to the high school kids. And this is the day that eluded their mothers, their fathers, their grandparents. Yeah, Crystal! Crystal! Go Crystal! Raven Olivia Gribbins. Richard Joseph Carter. Crystal Alexandra-- Tassels from one side to the other. Go Raven! I'm proud that she made it. And I can't wait to go see her graduate from college. It's very special. She's the first one that graduated from high school. I went to school there myself. I've got a ninth grade education. I'm a carpenter. I do that for a living. That's what I do. Well, I had three other sons, but this one was my first one to graduate. It was really great. I'm so proud of him. smile. Smile! Happy day! We talk all the time as a staff about raising test scores and raising reading levels, and all of that stuff is so important. But I firmly believe that attacking the poverty is the most important thing that we do. Yeah, yeah. I want to leave with class, you know. There's a lot of people I'd like to really save my mind to, but it won't help anything, you know I mean? Yep. Yeah, I resigned last night after 15 years at Oyler. So obviously you knew about my woes. Cincinnati Public made it pretty easy for me to make the decision, but most importantly, the opportunity to be a superintendent presented itself in Manchester, Ohio. That should now read, "You know I'm still sitting at my desk and crying." it's been great being your secretary. Congratulations as a superintendent, and now you can put Manchester on the map just like you did Oyler." I'm scared I'm going to get there, and then I'm going to do real bad where I'm not going to get up and be late to classes. Or like when I meet my professors and stuff, I'm going to have a bad first meeting, like a bad impression. Then I'm scared they're not going to like me. It's a lot of things you've got to think about. If you don't have your Penn State ID yet, get some photo identification ready. I got mine. Uh-oh. Uh-oh, it worked. They let you in. All right, well won't you kind of start getting settled in. Me and your daddy will carry it all in. Look how fluffy them pillows are. You actually think that bed looks OK? It's all right. She's not in the Navy. That's probably the best it's going to look for a long time. Tuck it. Tuck it up underneath. No, because it's supposed to be like this. Let your dad get your TV hooked up. I know, right. going to cry again. Why are you crying? It'll be OK. Love you! All righty, I am out of here. I'll catch you later. Give me a call on my cellphone. Bye-bye. The test scores for this past school year, they were troubling. There comes an opportunity where you've just got to take ownership. Somebody's got to take ownership of what happened, and that would be me. I'm taking each day one day at a time because I was very, very emotionally attached to Oyler. And I was very protective of Oyler. I treated those kids as if they were the last flower in the garden, you know. So it was tough. Renee. Give me a kiss. Say hi, camera. You going to wave to it? Miss Funk's got 14 kids who went through my school, or 15. 10. 10. They felt like 15. Yeah, it did. Hey, Steve, will you do me a favor? Walk down to Staebler, just kind of peek down there. Because what they'll do is they'll eventually start balling up down there. Just see it and then come back.
