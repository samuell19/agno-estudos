Mm. This place is starting to look more like a... ...museum... ...than a storefront. Maybe we ought to start charging admission, what do you think? - Maybe. - Hm. All right. I'm gonna go stop by for some coffee uh... Want some? Yeah. I'll take my usual. Hi, there. Hi. Are you okay? Yes, I... Yeah, I can see that. I'm sorry, um... Angie's not here... so... Who's Angie? I... I just thought you were here for her. I'm Josephine. Claire. Okay, which one do you think is winning? I don't know. Looks like the tortoise is a little nervous. Yeah, he does. He's probably losing. I should get back inside. Are you coming in? No. I don't like funerals. Yeah. Well, the house has been paid for in full. Dutton Hoffers Books and News has been given to your sister, Angela Mitchell. Uh... the only thing left is to transfer the conservatorship. You'll need to have the doctors fill out these forms to renew. After all the expenses have been taken out for the hospital, the funeral, my fees, you have $384.23 cents. - I got five minutes. - I won't be long. Why weren't you guys at Dad's funeral? We were working. - Is that it? - No. I was going through Dad's will and I saw that he left you the shop and the house. - Yep, I know. - You know? I'm the executor on the will. Did you talk to Dad about that? I didn't ask him for it if that's what you mean. Don't take it personally. It's probably just easier on him that way. Can I still stay at the house? Claire, I'm not going to kick you out. Are you keeping the shop open? - Yes. - Do I still work there? Do you wanna work there? Yeah. Of course. Then, yes. That's fine. Are we done? Yeah, I'm done. Read this one before? Yeah. - How much is it? - Two dollars. You wanna come out with me tonight? Um... You got some crazy plans already? Not really. I just don't really... Okay! But... if you change your mind I'll be in the bar on Fifth and Main. Okay. - Thanks. - Yeah. Excuse me? - Claire? - Oh, hey. - You made it. - Yeah, yeah. I uh... I was just passing through, thought I'd stop by. I brought your book. - You left it at the store. - Oh, thanks. You... you really didn't have to do that. I was passing through so, you know, passing through. Yeah. You know what? You should stay. Um... - Yeah, I don't... - Come on. Order a drink. Okay. Can I get a whiskey, neat? Oh, that's Vicki and Steve. They're here every week, same time, doing the same thing. - Oh. - Yeah. Come on. What's up, Check? ...ended up with this sailboat that I bought on eBay when I was drunk out of my mind. That cannot be true. Um. It's true. It's true. Paton's honor. But like I always say, life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all. You always say that? Did you come up with that? I always say it and... No. No. But... you know, whoever said it, it's true, no matter what. Right. - To new friends. - New friends. - Do you wanna get some air? - Yeah, yeah. - You finished with that? - Yeah. What are we doing? If somebody sees us... This is it. If I can make it budge... - Not now. Just... Hang on. - Okay. I'll get here. Okay. There we go. Whoa. Oh. Ready? Set. Go! Whoo. You get the skates. I'll get the music. Um... uh. Okay. Whoo! - What are we doing? - Choo choo. Whoops. Claire, what were you thinking? You guys missed the funeral. We had to work. Great. Why would you break into the roller rink? I don't know. We thought it'd be fun. We thought it'd be fun? Yeah. I mean, it was Jo's idea - but I was in too. - Hey. Okay. Okay. It was as much me as it was her. - Who? - Jo. - Who's Jo? - What do you mean? Claire, I need you to be completely honest with me. Did you take anything tonight? What're you... what're you talking about? Did you take anything? Hallucinogens, stimulants, prescriptions? Did you... did you leave your drink unattended at the bar? No. Please tell me you took something. I didn't take anything. Gimme your hand. - Why? - Just gimme your hand. Cross your eyes. Cross. Close your eyes. Open. Did I pass, officer? This isn't a joke. Nobody here thinks it's a joke. Claire, who is Jo? Are you saying somebody's sitting next to you right now? Yeah. Jo, why aren't you saying something? Why aren't you saying anything? Jo, say something. I'll be right back. Hey, Claire? Hey, Claire, I'm... I'm really sorry. Claire? Oh, I love those. Stay away from me, okay? Um, hey look, I... I'm just trying to be a friend here. Uh... uh... Hey... I'm pretty sure that item was on sale, Claire. And... Claire, the honey? I mean, I thought I saw it, it was on sale. He's totally ripping you off. Maybe you should check the receipt? $41.12 Thanks. Good to know. You know, you... you really should read this. I'm a little nervous. Ay... hey Um... hm. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. It's nice seeing you again. - How are you? - Fine. I heard you had quite a night, recently. Well, it's been a while, so, I will go through a series of standard questions to make sure your file is up to date. Just feel free to answer as well as you can with whatever comes to your mind first. Okay. All right. Do you typically have difficulties concentrating? No. - Trouble sleeping? - No. Feeling of irritability, anxiety, anger or indifference? No. Um... Do you ever feel lonely or isolated? Sometimes. Mmm-hmm. Has there been any other incident before Jo? I don't know. Maybe. What do you mean? I mean... she seems so real, I'm... I don't know. How can I tell the difference? Claire... When was the last time you were at Graystone? What's at Graystone? It sounds spooky. I'm not crazy. What? Can I have some? All right, all right, all right. Favorite color on three. All right. One... Two... - Three. - Paloma. What is Paloma? I don't know. I don't know. Oh, if I punch you, will you feel it? I don't know. I... I've nev... never been punched before. If I punch you, will I feel it? I... Try it. Not too hard. - All right. - Ah. That was hard. Did you... you know... I have two questions for you. First one... Okay, if you... could do anything in the world, what would you do? You already know the answer. No. I... I don't think it works like that. - It's a stupid question. - No, it's not. Yes, it is. I'll tell you what I would do. I... would get... an RV... or a campervan or something with a bunch of friends, maybe a dog... I'd love to drive from the top of Canada... all the way down to Chile. What? Nothing. I like it. I've never been anywhere. - Not even on a road trip? - No. No? My parents traveled a lot before us kids came along and then... things got complicated. Is that because of Graystone? My turn. Why are you here? I followed you up here. Okay, that sounded a lot less creepier in my head. Okay, my turn. Question two. What's Graystone? Place where you send crazy people. - Really? - Yeah. Are we gonna end up there? Probably. That's where Mom is, so... Who's Angie? Was she your best friend before I showed up? Sorta. She's my sister. So... I like it here. Hi, Claire. Hi. What's goin' on? I just needed to get some of Dad's old files. Right. Everything should be back here. What're you doing? Um... I'm trying to fix this typewriter. I think I broke it. I like these drawings. Yeah? Me too. Is it your book? Sorta. If it your friend's book? Um... Is she here? - Umm... - What's her name? Jo. - Did you give her that name? - Lily! How about you go find a book like we said, to take home? I want this one. No. Choose a different book, okay? But I wanna read Jo's book. Do what I asked, please? Pick a different one. Fine. You should know... I'm... gonna sell the store. What? I've got a couple of offers already. You can't sell the shop. It's Dad's. I can. He left it to me. Um, if you don't want it, I can take it. You can't expect me to do that, Claire. Why not? Come on, Lily. It's been a long time. I'm glad you came. How's Angie? I haven't seen her. Oh, well. That's too bad. It's time for your medication. Sheldon, can we do this later? You know you have to do it now. There's only two of them. - Uh. - Can I see your hand? Ah! Lift your tongue. Okay. This is for you. I'll see you later. Reward system. Oh, they're always stuffing me with pills, here. I told them it makes me foggy. Well, you know that... I... I'm going to need a new tailor. The... The clothes here... I... they just don't seem to fit me they way I'm used to them. Nothing fits right. I think you look fine. Oh, well, thank you. And... where's Frank? Dad died. He had a stroke. Well, when is the funeral? It was last week. - Oh. - I should've told you sooner. Sorry, I just... Was it a nice service? Yeah. Well, that's good. He was one of the good ones. He... used to have a box filled with mementos... uh... Tickets to the theater... little notes we'd written to each other... um... pictures of... places we planned to visit. Things like that. He came every Sunday, after Church, to see me. You girls used to come with him. Do you remember? Yeah, I remember. You know... something about your eyes... reminds me of my mother. Are you okay here, Mom? Yeah. I'm fine. Okay. What? I asked how you were doing? Fine. Have you noticed any... changes lately? Any new people entered your life? No, everything's the same. Exactly the same? Well, Angie's selling the shop. So... I guess I'm out of a job. Hmm. Do you have anything you'd want to pursue? No, should I? It's... totally up to you, isn't it? It's not too late to go back to college. Or maybe pursue a romantic relationship with someone. Yeah. Like that's gonna happen. Well, um... how is Jo? - Still here? - Hm. What have you been up to? Um, I saw my mom. Oh, did you? And how is she? She's good. What did you guys talk about? Dad, mostly. I told her that he died. How did she handle the news? Well. Did Jo go with you? Yeah. She's always with me. Sweet. What made you decide to go see your Mom? I thought she should know about Dad. Mmm-hmm. I just needed to see her. - Let's go this way. - What? This place is great. Whoa. What're you doing? You can't walk on people. - What? - Well, you gotta walk around. It's creepy. What if you fell through? I'm not gonna fall through. Suit yourself. But I'm not walking on dead people. Is it the Fourth of July, today? Yeah. I think it is. You know uh... I've never seen fireworks. What? Yeah. You wanna go? No. It's crowded. Don't be a weirdo. And hot. Oh... come on. Come on, Claire, please. Please, please. Please, please. Please, please. Please, please. Claire, come on. Please, please. Okay, okay, okay, we'll go. - Really? - Yes, really. - Yes? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. Should've brought flowers. Oh, God. Somebody's excited. Yes. Yes, I am. You know what? Just do this. Yeah. That's it. - Hi. - Hey. I've a huge favor to ask. - Oh, no. - Okay. Can you watch Lily? - No, we're going out. - I can't. I have plans. It'll only be for an hour, so... No, I don't think that'll be a good idea. I got called in to work for an emergency and Angie's at the restaurant. This is not happening. I'm s... s... sorry. Maybe you should go home-- All right. I'll do it. Thank you. - Does Angie know? - Claire! Of course. I'll be back soon. I want you to behave for your Aunt, okay? Thanks. How you play is, if someone has a six and they have... or they have another card If someone lays down, they could take that card and give it to someone and then, if they don't have it, they have to go fish. So, what card do you have? Like, if you had a six, you could give it to me. A six? I don't have a six. - Then, I'll go fish. - Oh. Okay, game's over. Let's go. Jo, you know we can't go. Where were you going to go? Going to the fireworks' festival. Have you ever seen the fireworks? Oh, so Claire... Claire, seriously, why don't we go? Lily, would love to go. We can go. We can go and have fun. Come on. Who can say no to these faces? Where were you? You okay? Where were you? I went to see the fireworks. Oh, that's not right. Get in the car, please. Take her to the car. Look, I'm sorry. Told Rich I had plans. How could... how could you do this? How could you? I did you a favor. What're you talking about? I took Lily to the fireworks. We had a great time. We did something special. What's the big deal? You know exactly... what the big deal is. - Lily and Jo wanted to go to the fireworks. - Jo! I took them. - I didn't know-- - Jo wanted to go? Can you hear yourself? Can you hear yourself? Uh... Okay. I know it's a little weird. But I'm trying to figure it out. It's not weird, Claire. You're psychotic. Did it not even cross your mind that you might be dangerous? What? You of all people... you should know... we grew up in the same house. It's not like that. And you can act like this is because of Jo? Because you left years ago. What did Dad do to deserve that? He was selfish. He was selfish. He was in the same imaginary world as the rest of you. And she almost died because of it. I found Mom, Claire. Before it was too late. I found her. Not Dad. I do not want that to happen to my little girl. I'm not Mom. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Excuse me! Get away. Get away, all of you. What are you doing? Who the fuck are you? Get out of here. No, no, no. Stop. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. No. I don't wanna leave my kids away. I've never seen you before. Get out of here. No, no. Ah. Oh, no. No. Aah. Give me the keys. - Give me the key, Jo. - No. - Jo, give me the key. - No. - Jo, give me the key. - No. - Jo, give me the key. - No! Not until you talk to me. You're not real. Claire. You're not real. Get out... Jo. - Get out, Jo. - Claire, I-- Get out, Jo. No. Jo, get out. Get out. I didn't want-- Jo, go away. Jo, please. Please get out. Okay. Okay. Shit. How are you feeling, Claire? Has anything changed since we last spoke? How is Jo? She's gone. She's gone? When? - The other night. - What happened? I went to see my Mom after hours. Why? I was having a rough day. Did it help you? She was having a rough day, too. Have you seen Angie? Uh, yeah. I think it's a good thing. I think she would disagree. She was there too. And I think she understands. You should give her a chance. You don't have to go through this all by yourself. Is it weird that I miss her? Claire, why are you down here? What is all this? What do you want, Angie? I just wanted to tell you that I'm not selling the bookstore. Why not? The buyers were hesitant and... they were talking about turning it into something other than a bookstore... which I didn't like. So... I thought maybe it's time for a change. I could get out of the restaurant business. Be my own boss. And we could spend more time together. At least until we get the logistics sorted out. Maybe in the meantime, we... try to keep you from breaking anything. I made out a little 'do not touch' sign for the... typewriter. Just kidding. Are we okay? Yeah, we're okay. Great. So I'll see you at the bookstore. Yeah. Okay.
