Like father, like son. Both of you are useless. He hasn't paid me rent for months. Don't you insult my father! He is a good man! He's responsible! Move it! Kak Kiah, Kak Kiah. What are you doing, Kak Kiah? There's no need to hit my son. He's only a child. Say no more. Where's my rent? If you don't have it, leave. Kak Kiah, I'll pay you next week. Leave! Get out of here! Liar! Freeloader! Excuses after excuses! Where are you, Sherry? No answer. It's hot, it's hot. Wait a while, Biko. Here, one for you, Biko. Dad, why didn't you argue with Auntie Kiah? I hate her. Biko. Auntie Kiah was enraged. We shouldn't argue with someone that enraged. Nothing good will come of it. What will happen to our belongings? Don't you worry about that. I will take care of it. Auntie Kiah was only furious because I failed to pay rent. Once I pay her, we'll take back our stuff. Do you have money? Sherry, where are you? -In Johor Bahru, on a film shoot. What is it? Never mind, we'll meet up later and talk. Okay, bye. Done. Biko, let's eat. Okay. -Saya grace before meals. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious and Most Merciful. Allah, bless the food... ...You have provided for us... ...and save us from the punishment of hellfire. Amen. -Amen. Biko, if you're not comfortable, let's just sleep at the back. No, it's still early. I can't sleep. Dad, aren't we supposed to move into that house? Have patience, Biko. Uncle Raj is working on it. Don't lie. I've heard what you told Mommy. Uncle Raj has swindled you out of the money for the house, right? That's not true. Uncle Raj just needs a little more time. Dad, you should hire Auntie Kiah. Set her on Uncle Raj untuk he returns all your money. That's enough. Don't you worry. I promise you, one day, we'll move into that house. Okay? Thank you, dad. You're welcome. Now, sleep. You've got school tomorrow. Dad! Quit it! I have to honk. How else will we move forward? It's all right, I can get off here. Be careful, Biko. How embarrassing. Coming to school in a garbage truck. Anyway, Isa, after school,... ...my family will be going to Cameron Highlands. Hence, I brought the jacket. It's cold there, like it is in London. Boss, please. You've only been working a week, yet you want a two-week's advance? This is what happened, I was forced to leave my home last night. Recently, you told me you were cheated out of a house purchase. And today, you show up looking sad with a story... ...that you've been kicked out of your home? You've got it wrong. -No way. This company shall not give you any more advance. However, since you are my most valued worker,... ...I shall lend you my own money. Just remember, if you fail to pay up by the end of the month,... ...I shall charge you interest like a loan shark does. Do you want it? If not, I'll just keep it. Thank you, boss. Biko! Luckily, you didn't get run over just now. Quick. Why didn't you just wait for me up front? Are you ashamed taking the truck? Don't be ashamed. We're not stealing anything. Dad, what happened to my mother? Biko, here, I bought you rice. Go ahead and eat. Why are you always doing this? Whenever I ask about my mother,... ...you never give me a straight answer. Well, you refused to eat. You chose to sulk. Now, you're hungry. Serves you right. No, I'm not hungry. Biko, I need to go to the washroom. Here, get any food you want. I'll leave it here. Dad! Have you bought your food? -Yes. Dad. I apologize. Biko, hand me the coin box that I usually placed there. Dad, there's only 15 cents and a nut in here. It belonged to your mother. The time I wanted to marry your mother,... ...I was poor, I had no money. So, I gave this nut instead to your mother. You gave her a nut? Dad,... ...was my mother gorgeous? Don't you have her picture? They're gone. All burnt in the fire. I wasn't around, I was at work. You were fortunate to have been saved by a neighbour... ...but your mother..... What happened to my mother? Did she perish in the fire? Dad, can we visit her grave? Dad. Dad, come help me catch crabs. It's tricky. Let's go. -Hey, Biko. Come here. Wear your mother's ring. This is a nut, not a ring. Doesn't matter if it's a nut or ring. It symbolizes the love between me and your mother. Who knows it might bring you luck. Isn't it nice to be able to sleep under the stars every night? It would be better if we can go to Cameron Highlands. Why Cameron Highlands, all of a sudden? My friend went there. He said the place is exciting. It's as cold as London. Let's go there, dad. Seriously? You guys sleep in the truck? We are used to it. How could you let my godson sleep in the truck? Sherry, this truck is bigger than my previous home. Biko. May Allah have mercy. Biko, wake up. The sun is up. Biko! Be careful. Biko! Oh, God. Up, are you in pain? Enough. -It hurts. Man up. All right, up. The moment Mommy comes, you ache all over. You're too much. It hurts a little, right? Sit upright. Biko, why don't you stay with me? Your dad has to go out of town. -No, thanks. I shouldn't stay with a female who isn't a "muhrim". You're over the top. Do you want to go for an audition, like you used to do? Yes! I'm interested, dad. You're interested? Sure but you need to listen to mommy. Don't be naughty, don't ask for anything from mommy. You're screwed if I hear of it. -Okay. When you return, we'll go to Cameron Highlands, okay? For my birthday. You had promised. Raj! Raj! Raj! Raj! Raj! Where are you running to? Raj! Wan, I didn't lie to you. There's just a minor complication with your house. Once it is sorted, I will come to you. If I give you my trust, I will never get the house! Give me back my money! We're here for casting. Fill in this form. -Okay. Stop, stop, stop. Who let this kid in? Hey, it's fine. Hi, baby. -Don't call me "baby". My name is Biko. Biko! I'm sorry, Miss Sara. -It's fine. Biko? My father always listens to this song. Really? Are you here to audition for my music video? Yes, Miss Sara. Okay, we'll meet again later. -Bye. Excuse me, you are here too? Are you even qualified? -Hey. Hi, Biko. We'll meet up later, okay? Is that the boy who was bragging about going to Cameron? Yes, yes. He makes me want to puke. Forget it. You get ready as usual. Ready. -Okay. What's that? A ring. Dad said it belonged to my late mother. Is it? Biko, Biko. What's that, Biko? My mother's ring. Where's your mother? -Mommy. Are you done? -Done. Let's go eat. -Let's go. It's cold, dad. You wanted to celebrate your birthday on Cameron Highlands. You have to endure this. -I can't. I need to pee. Me too. It's so cold. Here, Biko, wash your hands. Luckily, we haven't gone up to Cameron Highlands. Or else, we'd be screwed. Biko, how was the audition? -It was fine. Kak Sara said I am talented. Kak Sara? Yes, Kak Sara who sings,... ..."Don't pretend you're single, dear." Biko, what else did Kak Sara say? Nothing much, only after she saw mother's ring,... ...she became frantic. Frantic like you are now. Dad! Biko! Biko! Wake up, Biko! Doctor, how's my son? -Don't worry, he is fine. How long have you felt this numbness in your arm? Quite a while actually, the pain comes and goes. But lately, the numbness is quite frequent. Do you have insurance? In that case, I'll prepare a referral letter for you... ..to seek a specialist at a public hospital. All right, doctor. Thank you. What did the doctor say? -Nothing. Doctor wants Biko to rest. So, it's better he skips the audition. I've been in Kuala Lumpur for over a week now to plan... ...and produce a music video for my latest album, in conjunction... ...with a concert to be held at the end of the month. Rumours are you left Malaysia 10 years ago after a failed... ...relationship. -Those are fake news. One last question..... -Let's take a break. Mr. Amir is so protective. Is Mr. Amir not only Sara's manager, but also her boyfriend? Come on. Regarding this contract, he pays..... You were supposed to park the truck here after work. You came to me, pleading with a sad face,... ...said you were evicted from your rented home and had no where to go. You have been living in the truck. I must be stupid to pity someone like you. You must pay for the repair. -Yes, boss. Boss,... ...what should I do in the meantime? You're asking me what you should do? Go move the goods! What happened? These items are fragile. If anything breaks, no client would accept it. I'm sorry. -Enough, don't lift anymore goods. Go get the broom and clean this up. Right. Isn't that Sara Zulaika? Can we talk? Yes, boss, that is Sara Zulaika. Let's talk outside. How are you? Fine. I just met your son, Biko. How do you know he's my son? I have met your wife. -Wife? Yes, Sherry. Sherry said you don't want Biko taking part. But this has nothing to do with us. Izwan, I have auditioned over 200 kids. No one is as good as Biko for this project. After seeing that his last name is Izwan,... ...I think we were fated to meet again. Izwan, if this is about Biko's payment,... ...I will discuss with my management team to... ...increase the budget. It can still be negotiated? Yes. I have no problem, however on one condition. Don't tell Biko about us. So, you allow him? If there's any further issue, just discuss with Sherry. Thanks, Izwan. -If there's nothing more,... ...I need to return to work. Sherry, I just spoke to Sara. She insisted to have Biko in her music video and... ...is willing to increase the budget. That's great, Wan. It can at least cover... ...the repair cost for the truck. That's true but I had her agreeing to one condition. Sherry, please help look after Biko. I don't want him to get close to Sara. Why not? -We're doing this strictly... ...for work and money. I don't want Biko to bond with her. I also don't want Biko to have long conversations with her. Once recording is over, take Biko straight home. Please? -Okay. Okay, thanks. Artist. This artist I like. I want to get a photo. What's with you? Brother, what's this? -What's your problem? Sara. -Husband! Listen here. Sara, you may hate me. He may hate me too but I will not let... ...my daughter's life be ruined by an uneducated foreman. Get it? Do you understand? -Dad. Lock the door. -Dad. Mom! Lock the door! -Mom! Mom! Dad, don't! Mom! Don't do this to me! Sara, are you okay? I tried calling but couldn't reach you. My parents have locked me up. Hang on, Sara. Please move back, Sara. Izwan. Sara. Are you okay? Mom. Auntie, forgive me. Auntie, I really love Sara. I promise you that I will take good care of Sara. I love Izwan, mom. Please give us your blessing. Sara. This is all I can give you for now... ...but I promise... ...I will replace it with a diamond ring one day. Will you marry me? Come in. Hi, Biko. Did you miss me? -Of course. Biko, come with me for makeup and later, a wardrobe change. Okay. This is the agreement signed by Biko's father. Thanks, Sherry. I've spoken to Izwan about increasing the payment. You may sign here on behalf of Izwan. I can't. -Any one of the parents may do so. No, I'm not Biko's mother. I'm not yet married. Biko is like a son but we have no actual family ties. So, you and Izwan..... Are we done? Yes, I'm sorry. It's fine. I will discuss it later with Izwan. Okay. In that case, I'll just go check on Biko. Yes, sure. Thanks. Thank you. Sherry, what are you doing? Rinsing bean sprouts. I need your help. I'm going to Seremban tomorrow. I can't bring Biko along. Will you look after Biko? But don't leave him with Sara. Who is Sara actually, Wan? No one. Will you help me? You think I don't have a job? You expect me to look after Biko all the time. I'm doing all these to help you... ...but if you're keeping something from me, then... ...what's the point of me doing all these? Please, help. I have something to do in Seremban. I promise to tell you when the time comes. Hello. Yes? Where are you? I've informed the Assistant Director... ...that I'll be coming in late. I want you back at the set now! Oh, no. But..... If you can't come, then don't come back at all. Understand? Hello? -It's fine, Mommy. If you have work, just go. I'll be okay. Okay but listen here. Remember what your dad said. After work, don't talk or get close to Kak Sara. Understand? -Yes. Okay, I'm going off to work. I'll come pick you up later. Okay. -Okay. Bye. -Bye. Miss Sara! -Okay. Biko. Do you want it? I can get it for you. No, my father has promised to buy it for me. Really? Would you like to come over to my house and play video games? Yes! -Let's go. Come on in. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Okay, let's go upstairs. Okay. -Let's go. Wow! Wow. Kak, can I do something that I dreamt of doing? Biko, you always do this at home? My house doesn't have a bed. I sleep in a truck. Sleep in a truck? -Yes, it's fun. Why don't you sleep over for the night? My father won't allow it. Hello. -Hello, dad. Biko. Where are you? I'm at Kak Sara's house. How come you're there? Biko, where's Mommy? Mommy was busy. She has work to do. Hello, Izwan. Tell Biko to wait there. Don't go anywhere. I will come over now to get him. Fine, Wan. I'll wait for you. Okay? Wan, I'm really busy. Why did you leave Biko with Sara? I had to, Wan. The director was furious earlier. Why didn't you inform me sooner? You're not dependable at all! Hey, don't simply throw a fit! I've called Biko and Sara knew, too. So, what's the problem? -The problem is I have a problem. The problem is you did not tell me about your problem. So, now, I'm asking you, who is Sara? I have no time to answer all these! I have an incoming call. Yes, boss? -Hello, Izwan. I need you to go to Terengganu. Terengganu? -There's an urgent delivery. When is it, boss? -I need you to depart tonight. Dispensing water. Kak Sara, this water is so fresh. Let's eat. -Sure. Biko. Kak Sara, is this the actual Western food? Yes. Why? My father lied to me. He said Western food only consist of eggs and sausages. Biko, where's your mother? Sorry, I can't say. Why? -Mommy told me not to. So, you've never met your mother? Sorry, I can't say that either. Okay, in that case, can we talk about Mommy? I just have one question,... ...does she like your dad? Kak Sara. My father likes you. Everyday he listens to your songs. That's all I can tell you. Wan, have you arrived? Not yet, I'm still on the highway. I have to go to Terengganu. I'll only be back tomorrow. So, are you still coming? Wan, why don't you just come tomorrow? Besides, Biko is already asleep. You don't have to rush back... ...and have Biko sleep in the truck. Can I trust you? -What do you mean? Don't tell Biko anything about us. For me, there's only Biko in this world,... ...there's no one else. -Don't worry. Once Biko is awake, I will ask him to call you. Thank you. -You're welcome. Honey. Honey, I bought you nasi lemak. Enjoy it. Nasi lemak again? You can have it. I'm sick of it. Even if you refuse to eat, think of the child. Do you know how many times we've eaten nasi lemak... ...in this month alone? 26 times. If you really are thinking about our child,... ...you wouldn't keep buying me nasi lemak. You are too picky! Just eat! I've already bought it. You're so hard to please. Calm down. Okay? Remember, whoever reaches the finish line first,... ...is the winner... ...but there are rules in this race. The rules are... ...there are no rules! On the count of three, two, one! Honey. Come and eat. I've bought a lot of food. There's a variety here. Come. You're still racing? No, I..... You still want to lie to me? Have you ever thought, if something happens to you,... ...what will become of me and our child? Honey, I'm sorry, okay? I promise never to race again. I swear. -Enough. Don't simply swear. -And you don't simply throw away... ...this ring. This ring holds so much meaning... ...between me and you. I'm just worried. -I won't do it again. Smile. Wan. Jie, my boss is here. Leave. He will make a fuss. Calm down. I want to share with you a good opportunity. If it is something to do with racing, I'm not interested. Just go. -It's not racing, it's different. I will pay you 5,000 ringgit. You just need to be a dummy and lose the race on purpose. After that, you can do whatever you want. Here's 1,000 ringgit in advance. You'll get the balance tonight. How many times have I told you, Wan? I don't want this worm at my shop. Hey! Don't simply call others "worm". Who's a worm? You're the worm! Stop it. Get out of here! You too, get lost! Boss, why me? Let's go. Wan. Jie. Is that the gang that has bet on me winning? That, you don't need to know. You just need to get the job done. Where's Izwan? Sara. Hey, where's Izwan? What are you doing? Whatever it is, let's talk outside. I'm not here to talk. Pay us the 15 thousand ringgit... ...we had lost on last night's race! Where's my money? Race? You'd promised me, Wan! Shut it! I'm not here for your marital drama. I want my money. Where's my money? I don't have your money. You don't have my money? Let's go. Honey! Honey, honey. Boss, thank you. Use the money wisely. Don't ask for an advance again. Wan, come on in. Dad! -Biko. Let me show you around the house. It's really huge. -Really? Biko, I have a surprise for you. Dad, come see what Kak Sara has bought for me. Dad, come quick. Hurry, dad. Someone's there. Game over. Dad. Dad, look! -Biko. Invite your dad for a meal. Come, dad, we'll eat real Western food,... ...not the sausages that we usually have. Come on. Quick, dad. I'm full. I want to go play video games for a while. Wan, let him be. Actually, I wanted to discuss a few things with you. What is it? Is Biko too naughty? No, Biko is a good kid. It's just that..... Who is Biko's mother? You don't need to know all that. If I am his mother, I deserve to know everything. You are not his mother. Izwan, please, I don't blame you. You have no right to blame me or anyone. If Biko is my son, I have my rights over him. You have lost that right when you left us. Biko! Biko! Yes? -Come here. What's wrong? -Let's go. Why? -Izwan, Izwan. Don't try to stop me! -I haven't packed my things. You don't need a single thing from this house. But those are my things! -Izwan! No, please, Izwan. -Hey! You want to stay here? You want to stay with this woman? You can stay here forever! I'm no longer your father. Dad, dad! -Go! Dad. I don't have an ungrateful son like you! Dad! Dad! Is there an important reason you'd wanted to see me about? Sherry, where's Izwan and Biko? I have no idea. Maybe they're out of town. Are you mad at me? What did I do wrong? What did you do wrong? You don't know how hard life has been for Izwan and Biko. You had left your child, and now you want to claim yourself... ...his mother? -That is not true. Sherry, you don't know what really happened. I don't think Izwan knows as well. Mom, dad. -Honey, stop it! Dad, go check on Sara. Mon, I'm sorry. Do you remember what you had promised me? Mom, go check on Sara. Has Sara regained consciousness? Please, Izwan, Sara repeatedly said... ...she didn't want to see you. Sara, I'm sorry. Where's my baby? Mom, dad? The child couldn't be saved. Your baby has passed on. Sara said you shouldn't be surprised... ...because she had warned you... ...that she would leave if you break your promise. Kak, I understand but the child? Okay, here's the deal, Izwan. I shall arrange for you to have the child. Sara doesn't want the baby. She asked me to dump the baby... ...so she could start a new life in Indonesia. So, from now on, Sara and our family... ...no longer want anything to do with you. You've ruined her life enough. She has suffered enough. Take this ring. She wanted me to return it. I regretted what I did, mom. Sara, mommy loves you. Daddy is to blame. I should've stopped you. I should've protected you. Father, it's my own fault. I disobeyed you. Now, I have faced the consequences. I regretted it. I shouldn't have married Izwan. I regretted it. Sorry, Mr. Izwan. The report we received shows that you have ALS. What's that, doctor? -Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. A condition that affects the nervous system and brain cells. You will experience problems with muscle movement and... ...sometimes, sudden pain. You may have difficulty swallowing food... ...and possibly speaking. Mommy, look here. Will you marry me? Biko, don't play around with that. It's not a toy. Have you cleaned the back of the truck, like I told you? Go clean it, now. You're not allowed to eat until you're done cleaning it. Sherry. Why do I feel like you're avoiding me... ...and refusing to talk to me? What's the problem? Are you angry with me? I met up with Sara, Wan. You both have a misunderstanding. Sara didn't know that she has a child. Her parents told her that her baby died in childbirth. I think you should see her. If you think you've suffered all these while,... ...imagine her not even knowing the truth. Oh, God. Why only now, are you telling me this? I'm in a dilemma, Wan. Will you... ...reconcile with her now? Dad, I have finished cleaning the truck. I'm hungry. Mommy. Mommy. What's with father? Dad, I thought you said you never wanted to see Kak Sara again. Why do you suddenly want to meet up with her? Biko, stop asking too many questions. Biko, why choose this kind of place? Well, Kak Sara likes places like this. Don't. Come on, dad. Hi, Kak Sara. -Hi, Biko. I need to go to the washroom. What's wrong? I think he's checking to see if he has enough cash... ...to buy you dinner. It's okay. Just tell your father... ...that I'm paying for dinner. We are celebrating the wrap of our music video shoot. Okay? Okay. Amir. Dad, what's taking you so long? Dad, you don't need to worry. Kak Sara said she's buying us dinner... ...to celebrate the wrap of our music video shoot. Come on, dad. Are you serious? Your sponsors are waiting for you at home, yet you are here? Oh, no. I forgot. -You forgot? I know that kid is cute but you're not supposed to be here. Your music video is done, your work with that kid is done. You should be at home, entertaining the sponsors,... ...not this kid. -This is my life. My life, my choice. -Fine, you can do what you want... ...with your life but this involves your career. Whomever I choose to see is not up to you. Just recall how hard we worked to reach this stage. So? Didn't I too worked all these times? How many hours of sleep do I get each day? Your career is currently gaining momentum, you should know that. You should know that. I have never once complained. This is not about you complaining. You're the one who should be entertaining sponsors... ...but you leave that responsibility to..... I am not Sara. You are Sara. I bring in sponsors, arrange a meet-up session with them. You should do the work, entertain them. Not me. I need my own personal time and you as my manager,... ...more than anyone else, should understand that better. No, Sara, I don't understand. -So, if you can't understand..... Okay, fine, I understand. That kid, Biko, will ruin your career. He's not just any kid. -Well, who is he then? An angel from heaven? Watch your mouth, Amir! -I don't understand why... ...that small boy..... -Biko is my son! And who is he? This is my dad. Okay. Now I understand why you are so invested towards this boy. And you..... Man, you got the balls. Where were you when she had nothing? I was with her through thick and thin. I took care of her. I built her name, I built her career. Now that she is rich, you bring this boy,... ...leave him under her care and ignore your responsibilities. You think she's a money-making machine? That's enough, Amir! Biko. Dad. Why did Kak Sara saya I'm her son? Is she really my mother? Why did you lie to me? Why did you say my mother died in a fire? You know I really wanted a mother. You're a deadbeat dad. You're a liar! Biko. What happened? -Dad lied to me. My mother is not dead. Is Kak Sara really..... You really want to go? Go. Sherry, take him to his mother. But remember, don't ever come back here. Don't ever come back to me again! -Izwan. He's all grown up, he's on his own. Now, go! Go! Is it true that you're my mother? It's true, Biko. I'm really sorry, sweetie. I didn't know. I swear I never knew about you. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left you. I really am sorry. Hi, dear. Look, I seriously apologize about..... Hi, Biko. -Hi, Uncle Amir. Okay, let's forget about what happened. Yeah. This is for you. And this is the talking points for tonight's press conference. Amir, I..... -I know you want to tell... ...the whole world that Biko is your son. But? -Please, not now, I'm begging you. We'll figure something out. Okay. If you don't want me to announce it now,... ...I'll announce it during my concert. I have made up my mind. Let's go, Biko. What's your name? -You're so cute. Look at those cheeks. -So cute! Are you planning to stay with Kak Sara? Not Kak Sara... ...but my mom. Why? You must get used to this lifestyle. Maybe once a month. Once a week or every night. Also, call her Kak Sara, not "mama". Why? Kak Sara has a career that is very dependant on her fans. They wouldn't like knowing she has a kid. You might ruin her life. Is that what you want? Why aren't you with your father? You don't feel sorry leaving him alone? I'm going back to my room! Biko. -Hello, dad. I'm sorry. What's wrong, Biko? Will you come get me now? I can't, Biko. I'm working. Mommy is working too. Call your mother. Mama is not here! Don't you love me, dad? I will wait for you. Please come now. Please, dad. Doctor, is this disease curable? For now, there's no medicine or cure for ALS. I can't, Biko. Just stay there, okay? Listen to your mother. Dad, please. I have work to do. It's important. Look, Biko. Later,... ...I'll come for you. Okay? You're lying! I hate you! I swear I wasn't lying, Wan. You can now look at the contract yourself. There was a complication then... ...but it's all sorted now. I heard you used my money to pay off loan sharks. That was all a misunderstanding, Wan. What's important is this house is now yours. You'll only need to pay the remaining lawyer's fees... ...of 7,000 ringgit. After that, you and... ...your son can move into the house. Excuse me. Where's Biko? He said he was sleepy. I asked David to send him up. Sorry, I have to take this call. Yes, Izwan? -Are you still busy? I have guests. Why? I know your concert is important. But if you want to care for Biko, you need to understand one thing. There's nothing more important than him. Why do you suddenly bring this up? -Biko just called me. He was crying and pleading to come home. Only I can't take him now. Sara, I know you are rich and successful now... ...but that's not what Biko wants. He doesn't want your money nor your gifts. He just needs your attention. Please check on him. Sweetie, what's wrong? Okay, okay. I'm sorry, sweetie. I promise after the concert is over,... ...I will spend all my time with you. Together, we will go see your father,... ...dine together,... ...just like you used to do with him. That was what you told me, right? Hurry or he'll be pissed. Hei, Izwan. Why are you here? I happened to be in the area and saw you, so I thought... ...I'd dropped by. -How's Biko with his mom? Biko is fine. -Sorry, I've been busy. I didn't have a chance to go see him. That's fine. -Are you okay? You seemed a little stressed. I'm okay. I was just at the lawyer's office. You know, the house I bought for Biko is all sorted. Okay. -Only now, I need... ...7,000 ringgit to receive my keys. After that, I'm free to move in. 7,000 ringgit? Where are you going to get such amount, Wan? Why don't you borrow from... ...Biko's mother? There's nothing wrong with that. No way. Plus, I've never bought anything for Biko. If possible, I don't want to involve anyone else,... ...especially Sara. I've taken enough insult already. Don't say that. -Sherry, Sherry! Hey. Where's the motorcycle stuntman? Have you found him? Hang on. -What do you mean, "hang on"? Look at the time! I want to start shooting soon. Hang on, hang on. -The clock is ticking! I can do it. Wan. Are you sure you want to do this? You need to ride up the ramp and leap over the house which... ...will then explode. Sherry. I can do this. Trust me. But..... -Sherry! Are we ready? Hurry up! Brother. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for coming... ...and sharing your feelings with me today. If you had watched the music video,... ...you'll probably recognise... ...this cute boy named Biko. And before I move on with today's concert,... ...I would like to clarify all the rumours you may... ...have heard about me and Biko. Biko is not only the model for my music video... ...but... ...he is also my biological son. Biko. Biko! Biko! Biko! Biko! Biko! Biko! Now that she's rich, you bring this boy,... ...leave him under her care and ignore your responsibilities. You think she's a money-making machine? Is this disease curable? For now, there's no medicine or cure for ALS. You'll only need to pay the remaining lawyer's fees... ...of 7,000 ringgit. After that, you and... ...your son can move into the house. Ready? Action! Izwan! Stop! -Izwan! Sara, where are you going? Izwan was in an accident. What? Dad was in an accident? Yes, Biko. I have to leave now. Hang on, you need to be here. We have a contract with sponsors. But..... -Listen to me. I'll make sure Biko sees his father. I will take him there myself. Now, you need to get on stage and perform. For yourself and for Biko. Sweetie, you go first. I will be there later. Come on, Biko. Beautiful moments of our love Is now history My smile buries the wound Stow away our love After all this time I accept the reality Sometimes I regret Us separating I feel your love Imagining you by my side Our memories will never Be forgotten Forever Still feeling your love Though it pains to love You'll always be in my heart Forever Biko. Izwan. Biko is here. Biko. How did this happen? I'm okay. Where's your mother, Biko? She's not here yet. Dad. I want to sleep in the truck with you. I want to look at the stars with you. Don't leave me. Biko. I want to apologize to you. This is all my fault. I should've stopped you father. Biko, I'm sorry. Izwan,... ...I'm really sorry. Sherry. You did nothing wrong. Actually, I... ...have a neurological disease. I won't be able to live long. I kept it all a secret... ...because I don't want you... ...sad. You have sacrificed so much... ...for me... ...and for Biko. I want to apologize to you. I know... ...you have feelings for me. I've felt them all, Sherry. Biko. -Dad. I have enough money now. You must bring Mommy and Mama... ...to see our house, okay? I want you with us, too. The ring. What ring is that? The diamond ring, Biko. Biko needs to give it to his mother? Izwan? Dad? -Izwan? Izwan! -Dad! I feel your love Imagining you by my side Our memories will never be forgotten Forever I still feel your love Though it pains us to love You'll always be in my heart Forever Dad!
