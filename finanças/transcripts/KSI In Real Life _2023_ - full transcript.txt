[machine whirring] [computer beeps] [start-up sound playing] [keyboard clacking] [upbeat music playing] [KSI] Back in the day, YouTube was a very simple place for the cat videos or random vlogging. [chittering] But I started to realise that YouTube could possibly be around forever. [upbeat pop music playing] As a kid, I was very introverted. Bit of a loser. But when I started my YouTube channel, that one button, and I became KSI. [music continues] Holy crap! There's a Black guy on the screen! Oh, my God, my dick is on fire! Welcome to Q&A Sunday. Put one in your mouth and say, "Choppy bunny". [muffled] Choppy bunny. - You're out. Out, out, out. - [laughing] [KSI] Please like, subscribe and tits.

What, you wanna push me again? Push me again! [commentator] JJ has got so much power. It's a big uppercut from JJ. - [crowd cheering] - [inaudible] [KSI] Once you go, "Oh, you know what, "I'm going to do this", then you can do it. I just have this mentality where nothing can stop me. That's just my way of thinking. Yeah. [KSI] Ay, yo, what's up, motherfuckers? And welcome to... - [men laughing] - [Logan Paul] Yeah. - [KSI] Impaulsive. Let's go. - [Paul] Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, we have KSI back on the podcast. Welcome, JJ, - to Los Angeles and America. - [KSI whooping] [Paul] Dude, it's good to have you. - It's good to have you... - [KSI] Good to be here, man. - Again. I made it. - [Paul] Again. You're doing, like, 10 different things here during your... - [KSI laughs] - This week, no? Yeah, just, like, music, working on my next album, yeah. - Just writing and everything. - [Paul] Sick. And that, too? That guy right there? What's that guy doing? Oh, Amazon. [laughs] Wes. Big boy Wes. So, he's been filming me the whole time since around June. Just, like, literally my whole life. Just, what's going on. [Paul] You like him, I assume, huh? Yeah, yeah, he's cool, yeah. Yeah, he's cool. He's... Yeah, bro, he's seen me, you know, the highs and the lows. [laughs] [KSI] I think people are gonna really see a completely different side to what they normally see online. [sombre music playing] [interviewer] So, JJ, how did you sleep? [KSI] It was quite shit... [chuckles] If I'm being honest. Um, jetlag. Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night, like, 4:00 a.m. I think I was tweeting some soppy stuff. I've always wondered, like, what... Like, what's special to me, or what meant a lot to me. Um... You know, I was thinking, like, what really made sense? You know, I have a load of baggage. [laughs] Um... I have plenty of money. [laughs] Plenty of fame. Oh, God, But, nah, nah. I have... No, I have a lot of baggage. And, um, I'm definitely working on that. I don't think anyone actually really knows who I am. Including me. [interviewer] Can you tell me about it, JJ, what's the line-up of the festival? Uh, well, so, for Reading and Leeds, we've got Stormzy, Post Malone, Liam Gallagher. Obviously, got people like AJ Tracey, Mabel, Yungblud... and me. [chuckles] [interviewer] Do you know how many people are gonna be at Leeds and Reading? I think around 30,000. I could be wrong. But it's gonna be a lot of people. [interviewer] JJ, I think it's 80,000. Eighty thousand? Shit. [laughs] Okay, then. Well, then, I've definitely downplayed that. I didn't know, I thought it was 30,000. Eighty thousand, come on. That's easy. [chuckles] [tense music playing] [crowd cheering] [inaudible] [KSI] Holy shit. [laughs] Holy shit! [laughs nervously] [interviewer] What's going through your head right now? What are you thinking? I want this to be a moment for everyone. I want everyone to be like, "Damn, KSI's fucking hard". [laughs] "I don't normally fuck with his music, "but, damn, bro, he's good live, you know?" [crowd clamouring] [KSI] We're here, baby. We're here. Leeds Festival! Oh, I've just been looking at the crowd. Like, this is... This is my moment, bro. - [man] Yeah, man. - Oh, coming through, like, "Hey, what's up? KSI in the building". - I'm here, baby. Shit. - [both laugh] [Randolph] Your energy's too much. - Yeah, no, bro... - I wish I had it. No, that's the shit. I don't know. Beforehand, I'm always just, like, chill, - like, relax. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then whenever it gets to the moment, - I'm there like, "Oh, let's go." - Yeah. [crowd cheering] [KSI] Hard. [claps] Let's do this, baby. [KSI] There's definitely gonna be a lot of people who don't think I deserve to be on that stage, 100%. "Look at this YouTuber trying to do music". "KSI next to, what, "Kid Laroi, Post Malone, Stormzy, AJ Tracey? "All these musicians, "and then you've got KSI. Doesn't make sense". So then I've gotta just show them it makes perfect sense. Yeah. I have to work harder than all of these artists, man, to prove that I can be in that position. I think, from my childhood, I've always had so much pressure to do well, so the idea of failing was terrifying. I... [chuckles] It's just scary, like, I think that's... Maybe that's my fear, of failure. [laughs] That's, like, my biggest fear. [cheering] I hope you're having a great time. Our next act is pretty special. Eight top-ten singles, a number-one album, and making his festival debut right now, here, KSI! - [crowd cheering wildly] - Damn! Damn! Team!

But you're just like, "That's... that's never gonna happen". - [interviewer laughs] - There's no chance. And it's like, "Damn, I'm here now". Damn. [KSI] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a brand-new video idea. Let's get a round of applause. I know right? What! Oh, my God, it's taken... It's taken years... It's taken years for a brand-new video idea, but it's come, finally. Today we're gonna be looking at my childhood. We're going on Google Earth to just look at where I grew up. Let's go into this. I think we'll start off where everything started, my whole YouTube career. That is the big boy over here. Oh! Oh... Oh, shit, there it is. There it... Oh, shit! Oh, there it is! It's my old house. [laughs] That's my parents' bedroom, that's my bro's room. My room is in the back over there, and that's where I just did all my YouTube videos, start from the beginning. [mellow music playing] [KSI] Where we grew up in Watford, my parents were, like, I guess, your typical African parents. Wanted me to be a doctor, lawyer. [Jide Olatunji] We came here as immigrants because there is nothing in Nigeria. [Yinka Olatunji] I wanted more for my kids. More education. - Yeah, we wanted more. - Yeah, education-wise. And it's just to say that they've had a better-quality life than ours. [KSI] My parents were very strict. If you did a mistake, or if you fucked up, then you get punished by beatings. [chuckles] Where we come from, Nigeria, we have to respect our elders, kids need to be disciplined, and it's in the Bible, "Spare the rod and ruin the child". It wasn't super loving. We didn't really do a lot together, if that makes sense. And I hardly ever heard my parents say "I love you". [laughs] It was a tough upbringing, in that sense. But I found salvation online, because it was like... Sounds so sad. It was like the camera was my friend. [chuckles] And I was, like, talking to the camera and just being like, "Yo, what's up?" And just saying just random things to it. - [lip synching] - ♪ If you're happy ♪ ♪ And you know it ♪ - ♪ Clap your hands ♪ - [clapping] ♪ If you're happy ♪ ♪ And you know it Clap your hands ♪ ♪ If you're happy And you know it ♪ ♪ And you really want To show it ♪ ♪ If you're happy And you know it... ♪ Shut the [bleep] up! - What's up, bro? - Say it, don't spray it. - But I just said, "Bro!" - [groans] [KSI] And then, you know, me and my brother, Deji, we just created little movies. - Ow! - [KSI] Oh, hell, nah! [chuckles] Damn, that nigga pissed! [KSI] I think it was just cool we were able to bond together doing these things. [Deji Olatunji yelping] Fuck! I wasn't ready yet. [groaning] [Deji] Growing up, it was just me and JJ. Having him as my older brother, I mean... When I was younger, I loved it. Literally, I loved... I... I adored him so much, he was the best thing ever. - Dej, get off me. - No. - Get off me. - No. Dej, why are you touching my dick? - I'm not. - Yes, you are. Get off me, Dej. What is this hair? What is this hair? You're so bush. [laughs] [in Nigerian accent] Did you just jump off the boat? [in normal accent] You're a fucking mess. Get off me, Dej! What you doing, bro? What... [laughing] [interviewer] When you started making the videos, how was your family initially reacting to them? [KSI] My parents did not like the videos, they weren't keen on it. So many times, my parents would either turn off the electricity, or cut out the Wi-Fi. [upbeat music playing] Yeah, they didn't really like the whole KSI thing. [music continues] [Jide] I think KSI drives him. KSI is untouchable. He can do anything, he doesn't care. JJ is very, very humble, quite easy-going. I knew that wouldn't work. Me just being JJ wouldn't work online because, you know, it's just not entertaining. - [electronic music playing] - But then whenever the camera was on, we were rolling, I'd just switch it and I'd be this different guy. I was KSI. Hey, guys. Your boy KSIOlajideBT. I know I'm not wearing any trousers. Yes! - But KSI is just, um... - [Yinka] His ego. - Yeah. - Yeah, it's the ego. - He's on another level. - Yeah. It's, um... Sometimes you just think, "Is this my son?" - Yeah. - You know... I don't think I'd want to have KSI as a son. ♪ Yeah, I'm on a horse Mother-[bleep] ♪ ♪ Take a look at me ♪ ♪ [bleep] a car I'm on a horse ♪ ♪ Do re [bleep]-ing mi ♪ ♪ I'll fuck a horse ♪ Uh, that's bestiality. ♪ Shut up, bitch, I don't care I just want my horse orgy ♪ [KSI] I told my parents I was going to make YouTube work no matter what. As soon as I was able to move out, I was just like, [snaps fingers] "Let's go, I'm off". I started to see my parents less and less and less. I definitely, like, slowly was destroying the relationship between me and my parents. And I essentially became a stranger to them. [Deji] JJ became more hardworking when he left home. He essentially felt like we didn't love him. So he was like, "Okay, I have something to prove". I guess he used us as a goal, being like, "Okay, you don't love me? I'll make you love me". But, I mean, it's like when you isolate yourself for a very long time, you might end up cutting out someone that is true to you. He might be so blinded with success that he'll just lose someone dear to him. [people speaking indistinctly] [man] Jeez. I don't know whether they said they were gonna put... Did they say they'd put the screens on here or black drapes? They said they're gonna see how it looks. [conversation continues indistinctly] [Jay Revell] I would say the main thing, JJ, is... I mean, it's harder when you're just in a room with us, but just even, like, kinda getting used to it, "Okay, I did that. I'm knackered. "I need to have water, have a break". [KSI] Yeah, yeah. I know. I know there's no rush in that moment as well. - You know what I mean? - Yeah, I do. Yeah. Yeah. [Revell] Are there any changes that you think you're gonna make off the top of looking at it, set-list wise? [KSI] Er... [laughs] We're gonna get rid of "You". [Revell] Oh, you're not gonna do it at all? [KSI] No, man, it's probably best if we don't. - [Revell] Okay. - [KSI] Yeah. [Revell] Cool. From the show in general? Um... [sighs] Yeah. [interviewer] How come you won't do "You"? [laughs] Ah... I don't wanna say right now. - Can you not say? Okay. - Yeah. Sorry. - Is it a private thing? - Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. [interviewer] How do you feel? [chuckles] Er... - [interviewer] Angry? - Yeah. [laughs] Yeah. [inhales deeply] All right, moving on. [laughs] [men speaking indistinctly] Check. Check, check.

How does that feel when you're up there? Yeah, I think it went well. Um, learned a lot. Um... Yeah, it's a lot. There's a lot more to do than a little festival set, 'cause obviously you've got... What, normally, like, 20, 25, 30 minutes, whereas this is, like... It can be pretty much an hour. So, yeah, just trying to figure that out, but, uh, yeah. No, I think it's going well. Guys have helped a lot as well, so... [interviewer] Does this come easy to you? Or naturally to you? No, man. I've always said I'm not talented. I've kinda just worked hard to a point where people think I'm talented, and... Yeah, and naturally, I'm... You know, I don't feel like I was naturally meant to be here but I've kinda got here through my dreams and passion. [interviewer] You really don't feel talented? Nope. But it doesn't matter, like... Like, how much hard work can get you. [laughs] [interviewer] You see, I really want to be a footballer, right, but I'm just shit at it. You can practice and practice, but I'm never gonna get to play for... Oh, but then you didn't wanna be a footballer. - Really? You think it's just... - Yeah. Facts. How many questions do you wanna ask me now? [interviewer] Can I ask one more question, JJ? Yeah. What's up? Why won't you play the song "You"? [laughs] Oh, you're funny. Um... Uh... I just... I'm just going through something. With, uh, my girlfriend, so, it kinda just... It gets a bit too emotional, so, yeah. But it's all right. It is what it is. Can't really control emotions, especially when that song plays, so, it's better to just avoid it. Yeah, I rehearsed it yesterday. I just broke down, so... I was like I'm not... I'm not doing that here. - [chuckles awkwardly] - Did you write it about her? - [KSI] Hmm? - Did you write it about her? Yes. Yeah. [clears throat] Yeah. I did.

How's the lighting? - [laughs] - Can you see me? [interviewer] Do you like meeting fans? Yeah, of course. Why... Why would I say no to that? [laughs] [interviewer] I just wanna know. [KSI] They've made my career. [interviewer] Yeah. I like his work ethics. The way he's grown up, it's been similar to our background, immigrant parents and things like that, and just... showing that it takes time to get to the top. - He's just really inspiring. - [crowd cheering] [KSI] Hey, yo, Glasgow, what's up? It's your boy! You know this is the first show of the tour, man. - [crowd cheering] - [air horn blowing] And you lot have brought insane energy. Eh? Here we... Here we fucking go! Here we... [crowd] Here we... Here we fucking go! Here we... Here we... Here we fucking go! [upbeat rock music playing] [woman] I think people say he tries to do too many different things, or, you know, he should just stick to one thing, but I think that's what makes him so great, is that he started so small and he's grown up with us, and we feel like we know him. [rock music continues] [KSI] Hey, yo, if you still have special someone next to them... [crowd cheering] [KSI] All right, who's single? [crowd cheering] All right, so, for the single people, this is for the people that you'll eventually get. [laughs] And now for the people in a relationship, this is for you, happening right now. [rock music continues] There was times I didn't wanna be here anymore, and it was just getting too much and I didn't wanna wake up and whatnot, and then when I felt really down and low and when I felt like that, I would just put him on, and when I put him on, he would just laugh, and it'd make me laugh 'cause it's contagious, and he was just an all-round honest, nice guy. Can just watch KSI and that would cheer me up. [KSI] Who's currently going through something? [crowd cheering] [KSI] Well, it always gets better, remember that. Shit will never be shit forever, bro. It will always get better, and we'll be able to get through together. [rock music continues] - [both] Thank you. - [crowd cheering] [fans screaming] [man] I see him more as a family member 'cause of how close he is with his subscribers and all his followers. He sees us as his family, and the way he interacts with us all, he's always been there, making videos around his fans, and that's just amazing. [rock music continues] [KSI] The relationship I have with my fans, it's kinda just like they're friends. I get bullied by them. I bully them. We literally are just so close. It's not fake, it's not them just worshipping me, it's them being real with me. I get messages saying, all the time, I've inspired people, I've helped them focus in their career, or I've helped them, just, you know, believe in themselves. [man] Yo, we just wanna say thank you so much for taking this time out, you know. I kinda wanted to start it off with just allowing them to kinda introduce themselves and kinda just, you know, letting you guys know who they are, why they're on this programme, why they're here today, I guess. You know what I mean? So, I'm gonna start with you, my man. - Introduce yourself. - I'm Kion. [man] What's up, Kion? But most people call me K most of the time. I kind of jumped on this course because I wanted to further myself musically, and any other field that's creative. [woman] My music style is a bit weird. I play rare groove, soul, lovers' rock, but everything else as well, but that's what I'm mainly known for. But, yeah, that's the lowdown on Pebs. I'm Chloe. To be honest, doing this is quite a big achievement for me 'cause I'm not a very talkative person, so, doing this is a big boost out of my comfort zone. Yeah, my name's Jamil. Outside of music, I'm very reserved and kinda quiet, and with music, I just feel like it's a missing part to me. [KSI] I started from my bedroom so I didn't really talk to many people, if anyone at all, and eventually I kinda got to a point where I kind of got forced into it, but you've gotta just learn how to swim with a lot of certain situations and, uh, yeah, I guess you guys are doing that right now. How do you deal with hate on social media? [KSI] You just have to live through it. You have to be thick-skinned. There's no other way. You can't try and avoid it, you can't try to block out words or anything because they'll find a new way to get to you. It's just always... It'll just always adapt. I've been, you know, taken the piss out of, I've had haters left, right and centre, I've had all types of hate, from racism, like, hardcore racism to just, you know, like, to how I look, you know, my weight, et cetera. But then I've just turned that on its head, and I've just... I just laugh at it now. For me, I think that's the most important part of hate. If you take it away from them and you just completely cut it, cut the power from them, then it's not hate. It's just words that don't mean anything. A huge driving point for me is always proving people wrong. There's a lot of people who've told me to stop, but instead I was like, "No. Watch". [Deji] So many obstacles were in his way, but he just bypassed all of them. There was literally nothing that could stop him. He would just keep going. People would say, "Oh, you can't do this", he'd be like, "I'll prove you wrong". But I guess it's kind of to prove a point to my parents as well. He wants to be like... "Look at me. "Look at me, I'm... "I'm here. Acknowledge me." [electronic music playing] [KSI] I think I was around 19 when I started to actually make money, and it was very small. And then it just kept going up and up and up to, like, 10,000 a month, yeah. That was... That was really crazy. Like, I couldn't believe that. And even my parents couldn't believe that. When we went to see the accountant, he was gobsmacked, said, "Wow!" You know, that... You know, a guy that young that is already earning money and he already knows what he wants to do, you know, that was an achievement. Even a few people that I told, you know, there was a church I used to go to and I kind of discussed it with them, would you believe it, the following week, they totally blanked me. Yeah. 'Cause it's all to do with envy and jealousy, isn't it? [laughs] When I wasn't making money, they... they said it was a waste of time. And then when I was making more money than them, then they were open arms, like, "Let's go". Doing a Q&A Sunday with my dad. - How's it going, man? - It's good. Anyway, let's answer some questions. Let's begin with number one. "Does your dad masturbate?" Oh, my God. Bro, I cringe so much now at my old videos, like, "What am I doing?" But at the time, I was just in this bubble where everything was just okay. I don't know... On the Internet, that's just... That was just okay to ask my dad if he masturbates. Oh, God. "Have you ever caught your son wanking?" No, I haven't caught you wanking. Why would I? - Oh, so do you wank? - No. No, I'm just saying, too good. [Yinka] It's not good to wank, seriously. [KSI] Well, you would know. - As a Christian... - Flicking that bean. Even though Daddy does worse with you. [screams] "Flick the bean", I didn't know what it meant. - I did not know what it meant. - [chuckles] If I had known, I probably wouldn't have... I... I don't think I answered the question, did I? - Get hyper. - [laughs] [KSI] A lot of the videos that I made with my parents looked like we had a very good relationship. But whenever I would turn off the camera, we would just go back to being strangers. Maybe I didn't reach out to them as much, but they didn't really reach out to me as much as well. So, you know, it's a two-way thing. [interviewer] Can I ask about your girlfriend? - [KSI] Yeah, yeah. - What happened? [KSI] I knew this was coming. So, me and my girlfriend aren't together anymore. Well, we... Me and my ex. Yeah. Um... Yeah. I broke it off. I broke it off, yeah. Um, yeah, I... I felt like... I mean, I... I don't know if she'll ever see it this way, but I felt like I was doing her a favour. Yeah, because just my lifestyle, man, it's just... You know, I'm too busy to have a relationship right now. Next year, I'm going to LA, and then I'm going on tour in the UK, then I'm going on tour in Europe and doing all these things, you know, work-wise, and I'm like, "When am I gonna find time to see her? "When am I gonna have time to, you know, properly be with her?" Obviously, there's other things as well, but I just thought it's not fair on her, and I knew she was getting agitated over it. And she just works a normal 9:00 to 5:00 job. [interviewer] How long were you together and how serious was it? [KSI] Yeah, it was pretty serious. Three and a half years. Yeah, it was a long time. [interviewer] But couldn't you have changed things if you really wanted it to work? I'd say the relationship just didn't work. We just... We also just didn't... We weren't... good for each other. We were, and then we weren't, if that makes sense. She said I don't get excited for anything anymore. It's like I'm dead inside. I was like, "Fuck. "She's kind of right." - [interviewer] Really? - [laughs] No, no, I do get excited, but... I don't know, when you've kinda just done so well in so many things, et cetera, you kinda just go, "Oh, okay", and then nothing really hits the same. I don't know. I don't know what I'm saying. It's crazy. I really thought she was gonna be the one for me. She's such a private person. And then she's with one of the most famous people in England. [chuckles] So, was that ever gonna work? Probably not. [chuckles] Yeah. Maybe it was doomed from the start. [speaking indistinctly] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You got a little boogeroo. You got a little booger. [man] Good? Are we good? [KSI] No, left. Right. Yeah. [director] Right, guys. Quiet on set now, please. [man] And speed. - [director] Camera rolling? - [cameraman] Rolling. [director] And action. [men laughing and speaking indistinctly] [director speaking indistinctly] Get out, get out. Come on, move, move. - [director] Cut there. - [interviewer] How's it going? Chilling, bro, just eating food... [interviewer] Are you enjoying this? And getting rich from it. [laughs] I mean... There's not really much else going. Yeah, we're happy with that. Now we can go downstairs and drag these guys... [interviewer] What do you guys need to do now? Portraits? There needs to be a portrait, yeah. Am I good? All right. - [director] Done, can we do... - Losing my shit. [director] Can we get the tray set up for one more GoPro? [KSI] I'm off. Sorry I'm late, boss. Fucking... I've eaten so much food. - [interviewer] What was it for? - Fuck. Uh, Sides... So, our, like, Deliveroo restaurant thing. So, he's just starting a Deliveroo business now. [KSI] Yeah. [laughs] - Yeah, bro, just... - [KSI] I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, there's alcohol as well. We've got alcohol business going. - [S-X] Oh, okay! - [laughs] - Tell me. - Yeah, yeah, just... - We're doing vodka. - Really? - Yeah, like, flavoured vodka. - No way. Yeah, literally. [laughing] Making moves, bro. Making moves. Why not? I mean, it's... Yeah, we're able to do it. I was able to venture from YouTube to music to boxing, so, why not do restaurants as well? - [S-X] That's it, bro. - [laughs] - I feel like, for you... - And alcohol and fucking lampposts, if we want. [laughs] But there's no limit. I was gonna say, for you, there's no limit... - Yeah. - You can just do whatever you want, for real, and it just makes sense, bro. Yeah. We're in... We're in this beautiful spot where... - You can touch everything. - Yeah. Yeah, we can really just do anything. - Whoo! - [laughs] [upbeat rock music playing] [music continues] [Deji] He has an addictive personality, in the sense that, he's tasted victory, he wants to keep tasting it. He knows the consequences, but he doesn't care. He's like, "I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get this. "I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get this goal." [music continues] [KSI] Yeah, it just goes back to the whole KSI character. I feel like I'm in control of everything, like I can just do whatever the fuck I want. And not to say anything bad about my ex, but I definitely feel like she tried to bring me back to how I was before. Now I'm just kinda... I don't know, I just feel more alpha. [laughs] I just feel more like a boss. [rock music continues] [man 1] Sidemen are killing it, by the way. [man 2] Yes. We're thriving, man. [KSI] Yeah, we're actually fucking sick. Our estimated earnings are just wild right now. - Q4 man, yeah. - [men laugh] I feel like we still have so much more to do. You've not got more to do with music and boxing? Um, no, it's... I've got more to do for boxing. [man 1] "I've got a number-one album." - [men laughing] - No, no, no. No, I still need to like... you know, like, dominate America, I feel. [rock music continues] [KSI] It's crazy, I'm literally going on dates every day. [laughs] New girl every day. I remember, when I was younger I wasn't able to even talk to girls. And I would google how to talk to women, and read books and stuff about understanding women, but that's just because I was this introverted, nerdy kid that wanted to be seen as a man that is desirable. [interviewer] Do you think you would get the same women if you weren't KSI, and you were just JJ? Definitely not. Let's be honest. Like, I'm a six out of ten, at best. But the money and the fame makes me an 11. So... [laughs] [rock music continues] [Deji] JJ's not afraid to cut loose anyone if they're in his way. 'Cause he wants to be the best. He's super-ambitious, He can't let anybody... outwork him or anything. He has that inner spite in him, and JJ and I, we've had arguments where he's literally told me, "I don't love you". He's said that to me. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Family Fortunes. [Deji] So, the beef all started off with JJ's friend. - Name a dead YouTube channel. - [buzzer rings] Deji. [laughing] Oh, boy, that's family. That's family, bro. [Deji] I didn't take kind to that so I did, like, a video response. You are the Sidemen's as well as JJ's bitch. You are literally their bitch. You're JJ's cameraman, he pays your salary. You spend more time with JJ than you do your own wife. And that video response, triggered him to make a diss-track on me. [rapping] ♪ Deji, tell me Are you brain-dead? ♪ ♪ 'Cause you still live With your parents ♪ ♪ I got loyalty deep in my veins You got no brains ♪ ♪ You got no friends You got no game... ♪ Oh, Jesus. ♪ This is your end You're just a poor man ♪ ♪ I can't lie You're just a Walmart KSI ♪ Oh, my God. Oh! Yo, fam. Randolph has gone so in. Oh, my fucking God. Deji's gonna be pissed, man. I don't even know if he's gonna wanna talk to me. [laughs] [Deji] The way JJ kind of got involved in the diss-track, I felt betrayed. - [hip-hop music playing] - I did some stupid things. ♪ You say JJ this, JJ that ♪ ♪ Call me Walmart Let's talk facts ♪ ♪ Yeah, he ran Yeah, he ran ♪ [Deji] That's what really triggered it, 'cause that diss-track that I did on him, it was like... You're not really meant to do a diss-track on your brother, but I was fuelled with rage. I told him we could fix things if he just deletes the diss-track he made on me, but he refuses. [Deji] Then I came back, and JJ was at my house. He was angry. He was saying he was gonna smash my PC, gonna break everything. [Deji] You came here to talk? I'm pissed. Go away, leave my house. [KSI] Shut the fuck up. [Deji] Little did I know he was recording everything that was going on. It was just arguments, arguments, and then I said to him, "Get out the house. "Just get out. Get out of my house". And this was during Christmas time. [KSI over recording] Cool. Whatever. I'm leaving. I'm off. [Deji] And then, the whole Internet just turned on me. "How are you gonna kick out your brother on Christmas?" We find out in this video that Deji has been non-stop either lying, manipulating, or leaving out facts to harm his brother, destroy his brother. The fact that you're just, you know, carrying on with your life, not giving a shit, really fucking annoys me. And I'm scared to even call my family because I'm scared you're gonna just take one negative thing that I say, manipulate the audience, and just make me look as bad as possible. I hate being... being seen as a bad guy! And I hate it so much. I hate it. I fucking... I... I'm just sick and fucking tired of it. You need to understand what you're doing, and it's not cool. I'm done. I'm done, guys. I'm done. I... I have to just put this out there. [sighs] So please, can... Let's just be done with this, Dej. [hip hop music playing] [KSI] It's been a while. I've kind of just left Deji to do his own thing. I don't think we're as cool as we used to be, like, back in the day, but we're definitely not as bad as we were a few years ago. [rock music playing] [inaudible] We'll do three minutes. Just get the heart rate up. Over there, do some stretching. When's the last time you trained? I train every day. - [Petrie] Oh. - [laughs] [Petrie] Good. Good. Three, two, one. - [grunts] - [Petrie] That is it. Fuckin' hell! [panting] [Petrie] Ten seconds, all the way to the end. [KSI] I always had that like, "Oh, he's my little brother, "I'll always take care of him". He's always just getting in trouble. He just didn't work hard. That's just it. He was just lazy. [Petrie] First round as fast as you can. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. Three, two, one. Ah, look, you ripped off a second. [Deji] He's a bully, huh? [KSI] Nah, it's good. It's what you need. - You happy now? - Yeah. [Deji sighing and panting] So, what, you train every day? - Boxing every day. - Honestly... Yeah, boxing every day. S&C, like, four times a week. Okay. I like the sound of that. You're one of the people I want to see me win, you know. I want you to see me win, hand raised. [KSI] Make it happen. [interviewer] Would it be fair to say you were best friends growing up? [KSI] Yeah. No, we were very good friends, yeah. I'd say we were very tight. After the whole public situation between me and him, yeah, that definitely distorted the relationship that we had. [Petrie] Three, four, five, six. Easy. [interviewer] Do you think if it wasn't for the Internet, you guys would have a better relationship? [Deji] One hundred percent. I wouldn't say it's a curse, but it definitely would've been different if there was no Internet. Our relationship... I think we'd be tight. [Petrie] Push it if you want, try eight. Try eight. There we go. Nice. - And better. It's a good finish. - [KSI] Nice. [Petrie] Cool. Rest up. [Deji] I just want it to be like old times again, where we would talk about anything. We were close, we would just... always have each other's backs. That's what I want. I just... I just want a brother. [both grunting] [interviewer] So, how was it, seeing your brother? I was impressed. I'm impressed. I'm always proud of Deji, but, like... I'm proud of him until he loses. What drives me mad is that Deji is so talented, but I just don't know if he has the self-belief to really succeed. But I think that's just mainly because my parents just allowed him to get away with a lot of things. My parents were very tough, and I essentially lived with the pressure of always doing well. That's probably one of the reasons why my relationship with them isn't great. If I'm being honest, I personally think that my dad loves my brother more than me. [laughs] But I think that's just a younger-brother thing. Deji's a very sensitive person, and looking at it, it's all to do with lack of communication. That is the problem. And when we talk about it, we don't address it. I told JJ that, "You're like your dad". That, you know, "You don't like dealing with issues". I mean, I do talk to them, but maybe when it comes to the closeness, the closeness wasn't really there. I don't, um... - I find it very... Like... - Yeah. Little things like, "Oh, love you, JJ". It's difficult to... It's so difficult. I mean, with Deji... Deji's different. Deji will push. - Yeah. - Deji will demand. - Yeah. Yeah. - For it. So, you can't get away from Deji. So, I think that's one of the things that's probably affecting JJ. Maybe he thinks that we favoured Deji over JJ. [interviewer] You told me about your parents, but can you just describe to me, what sort of people are they? Okay, um... My dad is very cold. Doesn't talk much. But I think he has heart. My mum's very talkative. Well, to me, she feels more loving, and... Yeah, nah. I'm definitely closer to my mum, funnily enough, than my dad. Yeah. Yeah. I love my parents. Obviously, I wish the relationship was better, that's just it. [interviewer] So, what do you think their version of loving you is? Uh... Uh... I guess... Um... I don't... [chuckles] Oh, fuck's sake. Ah, fuck! I don't... [sobs] Uh... I don't... [sniffles] [continues crying] - [interviewer] Sorry, man. - No, it's okay. Fuck's sake. I knew I was... This was gonna make me fucking cry. [laughing] Fuck's sake. Fuck you, man. [laughs] [interviewer] I didn't expect it. I know it's a lot. Nah, nah, it's all right. Nah, it's all right. Uh, I don't really know. It's funny, like, um... You know, I talk to a few people about what my love language is. And, er... I say... I say, for me, it's just, like, physical touch, 'cause I... I never really got it from my parents. So, I don't know, it's just... Yeah, it's just nice to, like... just have someone, you know, hug me and say that, "I love you", and stuff like that. I never really got it from my family. So, yeah, I guess... Yeah, I think... Loving-wise, I think I just struggled with my parents. [sombre music playing] [KSI] I think that's one of the reasons why I'm starting to see a therapist 'cause I just feel like there's definitely things in my childhood that need to be addressed. [upbeat hip hop music playing] [speaking indistinctly] [KSI] Uh, number four. Okay. I wonder whose that is. Jeez. [speaking indistinctly] - [KSI laughs] - Turn to the right. [exclaiming excitedly] There we are. You see, different. Different. Now I'm living. Now... [laughs] I'm KSI now, yeah. [man] This is how you should've been living. Yeah, you know what I mean! Fucking hell. Welcome. Welcome to my humble abode, man. It cost me over 10 mil. I would say that the bank is hurting a little bit, but we're all right. [chuckles] But, yeah, come through. Come up. Let me show you what I got. So, this is the second living room. Or, I guess, the living room to my room, which is over here. Ah, ah, ah. Oh, here we go. Welcome to my bedroom, my palace. The palace. Wardrobe space, plenty. Plenty. Bro! What? Two showers? Shut up. [laughs] Then we have another floor. [sighs] So, yeah, this was the bed that we said we'd leave in. - Yeah, we're leaving this bed. - Yeah. - [intercom ringing] - Oh? Who's that? Oh. Yo, yo. [woman] Hiya, we're all here. We're just gonna go and grab some lunch. - Is that all right? - Yeah, go for it, go for it. And I think, um... I think JJ's here. I think he's just gone around in a car, I believe. Yeah, I'm talking to you right now. [chuckles] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry! - Nah, nah, that's all right. - Are you in? Yeah, I'm inside the house, yeah. We'll be back in about 20 minutes. Thank you so much. Okay, yeah. Cool. All right, in a bit. All right. Bye. Look at that. [kisses] Easy. All right, this is a guest room. Yeah, man, guest is living good. So... [laughs] And then... just other bathroom, just because. [laughs] Oh, this one also has a shower. I didn't even realise. I never checked that side of the door. Wow. Another shower in... Oh, flipping heck. [interviewer] Have you not seen your place? [KSI] I've seen it once, that's it. Yeah, I've only seen it once. Yeah. I've seen videos, so it reminded of, like, "Wow, yeah, this is sick," but... Yeah, I've only been there once, and that was all I needed. I saw it once and I was like, "Yeah, this is it. This is the one". This is my dream house, man, in London. Dream house in London. [interviewer] What do you think your parents will make - of this house? - [laughs] [KSI] I haven't shown them anything. - [Paul] You tweeted this... - [KSI] Oh, God. [Paul] "What is true love?" - [KSI laughs] - [Paul] Then the next one, "How can I love someone when I don't love myself?" - [KSI] Oh, Jesus! Oh, bro. - [Paul] What are you doing? What's going on with your heart? Bro, I was single, innit. So I'm just going through a heart break. When I'm alone and I'm listening to certain music, I just get in my feels, and I'm like, "Fuck, I miss her, man." - And then... - [laughs] [Paul] "I should text her". [KSI] [laughing] Yeah. - But... but you tweeted this... - [KSI] Oh, God. - "What is true love?" - [KSI laughs] Did someone give you the answer? 'Cause if they did, let me know. [mellow melancholy music playing] [door opening] [hip-hop song playing over speakers] All right. Yo. - How you doing? - Nice to meet you, bro. Nice to meet you, boss. [people speaking indistinctly] I was thinking about calling the album "Caught in Two Minds." I was thinking about calling the album "Caught in Two Minds." Oh, wow. So it's like... whether I want to be in a relationship, or what if I just want to be out there like a boss-esque, you know, like, doing my thing. - So, it's like finding that... - Balance Balance, yeah, or finding where I lie. Do you change where you lie on that from day to day? Sometimes. It's gotta make sense. Who was that one person you were like, ah, you should talk to them? Er, Emma Watson. Not Emma Watson, nah, she's beyond. [man] That's wifey. Like, yeah, she's, but nah I mean, I already squeaked when I saw her. [man] I think girls appreciate a squeak... No, bro, she needs a man, and I just fucked that up instantly [both chuckle] from the first meet up. [man] What did you say? I'm not even gonna repeat it. [in high-pitched voice] Hi, Emma. [chuckles] [KSI speaking] Fuck off, bro. Sometimes some of your suggestions are just... Bro, my fairy tale projection of your life, you end up back with her and you guys happy ever after. I like that. But before you do, I want you to sow your royal oats. So that when you go back, you're like, "All right, "I definitely know the grass is not greener on the other side." Yeah, but, you know... also her choice. Oh, yeah yeah. She can also decide, "I ain't waiting for you." That's why I said in my ideal projection of how things roll out for you. [KSI] Mmm. Because, er, yeah, she's sick. She's really just sick. Yeah. Yeah, she is. [woman singing indistinctly] [singing indistinctly] [song fades] [KSI] Everything happens in waves. Especially from a break up. The first wave is like a tsunami, and over time it gets less and less and less, and, yeah, every now and then I still, go, "Oh, shit". Like, you know... "I miss her", or like, you know, "We had a really good thing going. "I kind of wish we could've done things better", or, you know, "What if..." et cetera. [interviewer] Do you know how she's feeling at the moment? [KSI] Yeah, no, she... She's good. Obviously, her guard is up. [laughs] And rightly so. I'm not easy to be in a relationship with. I have this tendency to always just bail out, and it's a really bad habit of mine, and, it's just... Yeah, sometimes my mind just goes, "Oh, fuck! [laughs] "Bail!" [Charlie Handsome] What are you doing there? Are you trying... Do you wanna hear shit or do you just want us to make random shit up? Um, yeah, just... For me, I think, hearing stuff, 'cause then I can definitely feel an emotion from that. ♪ I know you said "I gotta go" ♪ ♪ Yet again I'm moving on ♪ ♪ In a week, you said And on and on and on ♪ ♪ But I loved you ♪ - Better? - [music stops] - Or more boring? - [Handsome] It was better. No, it was better. I don't know if it's it yet, but it is good. - Okay. - I think it is good. [Mams Taylor] What don't you like about it? - 'Cause I'm hearing his voice... - Yup. - [Smith] Yeah. - And I think it really... - To me, it sounds really dope. - [Smith] It'll sound good.

[sombre music playing] [inaudible] [sombre music continues] [KSI] Come back from LA, I did a lot of reflecting on the past and all the things I messed up on. When I created the KSI character, I wanted to be more like him. He was this alter ego that allowed me to be confident and believe that I was bigger than I actually was. And I didn't really see the side effects until later on. [mid-tempo rock music playing] I've realised that being KSI just slowly ruined the relationship between me and my family, for sure. [music continues] [speaking indistinctly] [KSI] I kinda just have stepped back and gone, "Okay, what's important in my life? "What do I need to properly sort out?" And I realised being close to the people closest to you is very important, and that's what I feel like, family-wise, I need to really fix that. Alex Wassabi, you desperate fucker. You got your wish. I'm going to bury your already-dead career. You ran from my bro, but there's no escaping me. I want to see all my fans there to witness my redemption. [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, your main event of the evening. This is the final bout between Alex Wassabi and Deji. - [KSI] How you feeling, bro? - Feeling good, JJ. How are you? I'm good, man. I'm good. Good. - [Yinka] Hi. - [Taylor] Nice to meet you. [KSI] Jeez! He's out there. We go again. We go again. I want to bring it back home, no messing. [chuckles] Don't give him nervous energy. Nah, he's got this. Nah. How you feeling? How you feeling, bro? I cried. Why did you cry? I'm watching your back, don't say that shit. No, it's okay, it's okay, bro. I cried at my camp. - I cried at my camp. - It was just... - the stress. - Yeah, it's all right. It's all good. That's you releasing all that stress, all that nervous energy. Come on, man. - Come on. - [Yinka speaking] Deji, please just don't disappoint. [KSI] Don't let losing be an outcome. Think of it like, "All I can do is win. "That's my destination, that's all it is". You're a fucking gladiator, bro. You're a gladiator. - Show everyone you are. - Yeah. All right, bro. Kill it, man. All right? [announcer] The time for talking is over, and the time for action is now! - [rock music playing] - [crowd cheering] [bell rings] You want this! Go get it! Deji, go get it! Attack! Attack! Yes! Yes! Go! - [bell ringing] - Deji, come on! [shouting indistinctly] [bell ringing] - [KSI] Just look good. - [Deji] Do I go again? - Huh? - Do I go again? What do you mean "go again"? Do I box again? Oh, if you win, yes. If you lose, then, no. Dej, this is your opportunity. This is your chance, bro. Okay? So, go. You think you won? - Okay. - I don't know. - Do you think I won? - What do you think? [crowd clamouring] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, declaring your winner by split decision... Alex Wassabi! [crowd clamouring] [KSI] You could've won that, it was there, and you just didn't take it, and that's why I'm like, you need that mentality to go, "Fuck it, I'm going to win". I was screaming, "This is your last round, "Do this. Let's go. Take this opportunity". The idea of losing, bro... Can... Bro, for me, I can't ever fathom it. I'm terrified of losing. I'm scared, bro. It terrifies... And you know why? Because it sucks. So I put in that work, and I do extra and extra and extra. - I do. I do... - It's frustrating! - You don't understand. - I do. I know it's frustrating. I wish I could put my fucking brain into yours so you can actually understand what it... - I do want this, I promise you. - But it doesn't... - You don't show it. - I know it doesn't look like it, but I've only just realised how much... Why have you just realised now after you've lost again, bro? No, I'm saying I realised, my last fight... But why didn't you win this one? [sighs] Yeah, I know. If you get another chance, because obviously you have to face the public... [Deji] Are you behind me? Bro, I'm always behind you. What do you mean, am I behind you? I'm always behind you. I mean, if I get in the ring again, will you back me? [KSI] Well, I'm always here. Why would I ever not back you, bro? I'm your brother, bro. It's okay. Even if I wasn't your brother, all right? - You little dickhead. - [laughs] All right, I'm gonna head in, so, see you in a bit. See you in a bit, JJ. [KSI] Yo, what's up? It's your boy KSI. Deji, I... I'm... I'm disappointed. You've lost three times. Three times, man! I don't think you have what it takes to win a boxing match. The reason why I am where I am today is because most of the time, I do everything that I do for me. Same with boxing. I did that shit for me. When are you gonna finally do something for yourself? I know people are gonna be like, "Ah, JJ, you're being so harsh." "You're being mean", or "You're being fair." [mock laughs] I don't care, fam. I don't care. [sighs] All right, well... Yeah. Peace. [interviewer] In what ways are you a different person to your brother? [Deji] I guess... He doesn't care what other people think. I essentially do. But I can just sense that he's lonely. JJ feels like he's not part of the family because, obviously, we're all so close, whereas he's kind of, like, in the distance. So he feels like an outsider. [interviewer] So, how, as a family, are you trying to work on the problems buried in the past? I guess, like, my parents are realising that... he's kind of, like... He's on an island on his own, so now they're, like, you know, swimming to him now to help. They realise that... Like, er... It's a lonely world out there. But my dad, he just... I just told him, like, "You're not here forever, "and you don't want JJ to have a bad memory of you. "So fix it. "Fix it before it's too late". [KSI] Today I'm seeing my dad, which is pretty weird. My dad is coming by himself to see me. Whoa. [laughs] It's crazy. He's my dad, but I have... I literally know barely anything about him. [interviewer] Do you think he knows you? Ah, no. No, not at all. [doorbell ringing] - [KSI] Yo, you all right? - How are you? - [KSI] How you doing? - How are you? [KSI] Yeah, I'm good, I'm good. - Well, welcome. - Boy, this a big house. [KSI] Yeah, it's nice. It's a decent... Decent spot. This is the first time I'm entering - a 10-million-pound house. - [chuckles] Jeez. God. Yeah, well, I'll give you a little tour, obviously. - Kitchen. - You've done well. - Stairs. - Jeez. This a massive house. Yeah. So, how do you change these bulbs? You need to get an expert to come change it. Yeah, I mean, I can just hit up my PA to sort that. [Jide] What's this? [KSI] So, this is gonna be my YouTube room. I bet your internet will be very fast here, all this set up. Well, the internet is fast everywhere, Dad. [both laugh] And this... Ah, okay. You don't do any laundry, do you? [KSI] If I want to, I can, but I choose not to. I bet you don't do any cooking. Do you do any cooking? Nah, sometimes. It depends on how I'm feeling. Maybe boil some egg and do some toast? - I bet that's what you do. - Nah, well, I have a chef, so I don't need to do that anymore. - Okay. - I just get him to make it for me. - How are you anyway, in general? - I'm fine. - What do you mean by "fine"? - I'm very good. - Yeah. How's Mum? - Yeah, she's fine. - How's the dog? - Yeah. The dog is fine. I mean, the dog keeps me busy, which I love. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I... I'm very surprised that you actually, um... - Come here. - You came here. I need to talk to you about, you know... We need to be good. Oh, okay, so then, how do we work on being good? Because, you see, both of us, er... I believe... I mean... - Tell me if I'm wrong. - Okay. - I believe, as a dad... - Mmm-hmm. I believe I fulfilled my duty. Yes or no? Uh... Yes and no. - Yeah. - Okay. Let's deal with the "no". Um, I don't think you were that loving. Okay. My upbringing was, you know... Was rubbish. - I don't want to think about it. - No, it's okay. Thinking about it, it'll make me go bonkers, you understand? It was so bad. With my dad, we never... You see, we never sat down... - Sitting down like this, never. - Yeah. Yeah. We've never had that relationship. My dad's never... I've never been given a hug. You see, it's something I've never experienced. Well, if your dad never hugged you... - I'm not... - so then... And then you hardly ever hugged us. You see, my dad never... - Did your dad, like, hit you? - Yeah. And then, you've kind of just done the same. But, look, now, when it comes to now, let's talk about that. Is it something we do all the time? No, no, it wasn't something you did all the time. It's just something that just happened. Every time we were naughty, we would get hit. Because, to us, we thought that was love. - You understand? - Yeah. We're putting you guys on the right track. But it affects me in my later years, Dad. Just like it affected you in your... No, no, no, but mine was different. I got beat until I was 21 years old. Yeah, but still... It's still affected you in your later years, right? Yeah, but when you were five, maybe you can't even remember. [chuckles] Dad. I think... I think I do because, obviously, I'm telling you. There's times where I just hated you for it. - Really? - Yes. It's okay, Dad, I'm not angry. So, we're good? Well, I... I feel like, obviously, the communication could be better. I need to work on my communication skills. - I'm very bad at it, anyway. - I know. It's not too late for you to change, - as a person. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, we do say it, maybe, you know, "I love you", "Love you too", "Love you". But, you know, it's just... [KSI] It's actually kind of weird hearing you say it. Yeah. [laughs] Yeah, it's pretty weird. Yeah, these are things that should be normal. - Yeah. - Yeah, so I'm working on it too. This is a huge step. Do you know how huge this step is for you to be here by yourself? I think this is the most we've talked in 10-plus years, honestly. Which is kind of sad, but it's also kind of cool. Do you want to actually hug each other? Yeah, I mean, we do hug each other, don't we? I mean, we shook hands when you got here. - [laughing] - How's that? Is that all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - How's that? - Yeah, it's okay. [both laugh] [KSI] Like, yeah, like this. [Jide] It's nice. - [Jide] It's odd, isn't it? - Yeah. - Love you, Dad. - Love you, too. [Jide] Ah, this would do my head in. [KSI] It's actually really therapeutic. Look at where it could work. Ah! [laughs] Yeah, that's good. Oh. [KSI] Dealing with issues in my past has definitely made me happier. I am a work in progress, and I think that's... that's kind of cool because I don't want to be completed, 'cause then what? [laughs] Then what? And that's kind of how I felt last year. I felt like I'd completed everything and I had no purpose, and... Yeah, it was weird, like... Yeah, I was definitely not in a good spot. But now I'm great, so... - [interviewer] Amazing. - Ah, thank you, man. It's been a fucking journey, for real. And I appreciate it. [rock music playing] [KSI] Yo, what's up? It's your boy KSIOlajideBT. How are y'all doing? Your boy has an announcement to make. Your boy is performing at Wembley Arena. This show is going to be the biggest show I have ever done in my life. Best believe it's gonna be mad. [music continues] Signing your shirts now. [interviewer] I know you're on good terms with your ex-girlfriend. - [KSI] Yeah. - Is she here today? [KSI] No, no, she's not here. She said, "Good luck, not that you need it." "And just smash it and let me know how it is."
