God be praised! A son, finally! You have a beautiful little girl, Monsignor. But your wife, my beloved mistress... She left us for a better world. Sacrifice his life to leave only one other daughter? This child is Oscar François de Jarjayes, and will be commander of the Royal Guards. You will bring your grandson here, nurse. Among the lace and the silence, my son will need a companion. Andrew! Oscar! What a shame, to fight on this historic day! Oscar risks catching a cold. Get up and listen! The royal family announced the engagement of the Dauphin and Princess Marie Antoinette of Austria. It is said to have the radiance of a ray of sunshine! Eleven years old, and beautiful as a jewel! It's the beginning of a new era, of a golden age! The alliance of the Habsburgs and the Bourbons. The peace ! One day, when she's queen, I will protect her with my life. You will protect her, Oscar... I will protect you. Oscar, what a shame! Do you think the princess plays such nonsense? She's your age, and she's already engaged. Oscar, wait for me. The years passed, carefree. Marie-Antoinette had become Queen of France. The nurse had aged. Oscar and André had grown up. Your father has important news for you. It is no longer time to play. You are appointed to the Queen's Guard, Oscar. Your training and my trust in you are rewarded... my son. I will deserve your trust. André, you can't go with her. But I got you a job at the royal stables. Well, what do you say? Nothing, sir. Remember your rank and thank the General. Thank you, Monsignor. I dreamed of working at the stables. Are you being sarcastic, boy? This day marks a date in both of your lives. From now on, you will assume responsibilities each in his place. No encouragement? Not a smile? Congratulations, Oscar. Your life really has meaning now. High waves stirred the sea The ship was sailing under full sail The captain yelled "Turn around l" But his voice is lost... The wind moans, the sea responds "In no port can you moor "I will know how to seize you "Training yourself into the deep abyss..." These words seem to threaten me. I don't like those words. And you, Mr. Leonard? I strive to find the rhyme, but my mind is absent, I do not have time. Miss Bertin! I was starting to get bored. "Beat of a troubled heart." Magnificent ! "First flower of spring... "to the kiss of frost." Breathtaking ! "Silent Song of Twilight." My dear sister, my friend, what is it? Forgive me, madam, my heart is gripped by so much beauty that will never be mine... My dear Gabrielle, don't you know that you can have anything you want and more... You are too good, my beloved. You look frozen, Oscar. No need to stand at attention. You are free to melt. I was watching this young man on horseback, Your Majesty. He keeps his eyes fixed on this window. It's him ! Count Fersen! And he looks straight at you! Should I alert the guards? Certainly not ! I shudder at the thought of him being chased away. You can dispose. I take all the dresses, except "Silent Song of Twilight". Whether adjusted for the Comtesse de Polignac. What do you think of our handsome Swedish visitor, Oscar? He is certainly a very handsome man. Curious you say that, Oscar. Why curious? After all, Oscar is a woman. Wonderful ! It's so modern... so mysterious...so elegant. Did you know that several ladies of the Court imitate you? Fashion is in men's clothes! Glad to see you protecting my wife, young man. I did the same, making sure his lock was in good condition. Why did God give you the destiny of a king and the heart of a locksmith? I'm interested in locks, but I don't have the heart of a locksmith. I rather have that of a hunter. Why is this young man staring this way so insistently? I do not know. He may be interested in architecture. Poor King of France, at the hour of love He lacks ardor What he has can't be used What to pee, pee Poor King of France, he can't dance He takes his feet... Do you hear this song? Well me... I've got all I need ! I swear to you that I miss nothing! And I have bread to pay! I will fill your stomach in more than one way! Joan! Why are you trying to hide? Miss Faucher's dress! It suits me better than that whore! Isn't that true? What's wrong with wanting a pretty dress? Remove it. She's not even dry... and I'm too tired to argue. Tired? I'll tell you who's tired! Me, I'm tired! Tired of scrubbing until my hands bleed. Tired of all this injustice! I want lots of things! And I don't know why I can't have them! Take that dress off! Have pity on an orphan of the House of Valois. The house of Valois? Impossible... Impossible but true. My father died when I was little... Impossible... but why would you say so if it weren't true? This dress is all I have left... It belonged to mother. Where is your mother now? She is dead. Starved to death... Sweet child, say no more... The Queen of France, she loves love Everybody knows it She bats her eyelashes, she sighs His desire grows day by day... She was there, like a painting by Lebrun, her big eyes full of tears, dying of hunger... My God, where is the justice! A descent of the Valois, - hungry! - Amazing! Out of simple decency, I took it with me. I'm raising her to adopt her as a niece. She will be noble then. And I dare say that you would make a wonderful couple together. Everyone knows that you have come to take a wife, and she will soon make an excellent match. Thank you. You saved my life. Are you on duty or guest? Guest. Play cards, my friend! See all these beautiful ladies without a partner who don't know what to do. I don't play for the same reason as you. I do not want to. You have seen ? If I went back to Sweden tell my father that women dress like men at the Court of France, he would call me crazy and a liar, or else he would believe me and would forbid me ever to return there. What is this fat that blocked your way, what did he tell you? He bothered you? Tell me, I'll go teach him a lesson. You do not speak ? Have you decided not to talk to the servants anymore? I can't stand you ignoring me. Have mercy, of a poor orphan who descends from the house of Valois. I beg you... What do you want ? You look good, and perhaps you will be indulgent towards an innocent young girl... I'll sleep with you to pay the rent. Even if I were a man, which I am not... I would never pay to make love. How much ? Andrew! How dare you ? Finally you find your voice! It's time I left my childhood games to taste the sweet wine of manhood. But I have no wine... Not even a crust of bread. My mother is starving. Hunger ? No one is hungry in Paris. The people of Paris are starving. And this proposal? Mother ! Too late, Andrew! You will taste this sweet wine another day. You never told me the people are hungry. Didn't you watch? Didn't you see anything? We have been here a thousand times. Hunger is not hidden, it is everywhere... I feel ridiculous. Me too, for not following this pretty girl. Go back to find her. I will go home alone. No, keep going! Do not stop ! Faster, fool! I can't afford a scandal. Mother... Don't shake like that. I'll warm you up, I'll heal you... I will have this lady, I will make her pay, I swear. Don't move it. I'm going to find a doctor. We need a doctor, and you're blocking us. Clear the street, boy I'm late and I intend to pass. You do not understand. Someone is dead... What can it do to you? This scoundrel breeds like rabbits and falls like flies. Nothing to do with you and me. The less there is, the better off. She is dead ! I demand reparation. I take up the challenge with pleasure, sir. What do you choose? The pistol. Your witness? My brother and companion. The place ? Sweet whipped cream. At dawn. I look forward to our meeting. Me too. Oscar grew up carefree and happy. She imagined the whole world like that. Until that night, she did not know that the people of France was on the verge of despair. Honor! Either way, it's not worth your life. And he doesn't even know your name! Risking your life for the honor of a name he does not know! But I know him! You can't go there! I will not let you ! I'll tie you up, if need be! But I won't let you go! Oscar, I know. What do you have to tell me? Nothing, sir. What can I say ? It is done. Although it is debatable to defend a poor woman to death, your zeal in defending the honor of the Jarjayes fills me with pride. My father gave them to me for my first duel. The butts are cut from panther bones. What if I die? You won't die. I brought you up too well. So it's settled. Stay with me tonight, as before... Everything was so simple, everything has become so complicated! We cannot go back in time. We grew up. Please...stay... I thank heaven it's not you. How did you find me? What do you want ? You will ruin everything! I became the niece of Madame de Boulainvilliers, I am engaged, I will inherit, I will become a countess! What can you be doing here? I looked for you everywhere... I have to tell you, you have to know... Mother... wants me to come back and waste my hands on his customers' dirty laundry? She is worried ? She is hungry ? She is dead. Well ! Nicholas! I just found this poor thing which seems crazy. She must have come in through the window to rob us! You scared my fiancée, huh! You made her cry! Just come back, we'll hang you by your toes! The Cardinal of Rohan! You remembered! How could I have forgotten? How is your dear aunt? Unfortunately, she cannot leave the bed. I worry about him. We've known each other for such a short time... yet, confusedly, I'm sure our fates are linked. Are you hungry, baby? You are tired ? Do you want to share a suckling pig with me? And then lie down on a bed of feathers? I don't bite, or at least, rarely... I like simple pleasures and tenderness... We are all the same, aren't we? Tenderness... Tight in the dark, hearts in unison... Rosalie! One minute ! Where are you taking this girl? Nowhere, young man. I asked him my way when I suddenly felt like kissing her hand. If you weren't in number, I would have the pleasure of gouging you out. What are you saying ? I said goodbye, young man! And you know how to handle yourself! I was trying. He promised me a real feather bed. I don't have a feather bed, Rosalie, but I have a pallet where you can rest. At number 19, down the street. Go wait for me. Even in this rat hole, there are other ways to stay alive. I will find you a job. Andrew, my friend, explain this riddle to me: now that I've learned to walk, to speak and fight like a man, and even to think that I think as a man, why can't I kill like a man? Because you are not a man. What are you saying ? You heard me. Say again ! Because you are not a man. I recognize you. Yes, the crash... Thanks for offering your help. It didn't help much. I also recognize you Maximilien de Robespierre. I remember your speech at the coronation. Your passion, my emotion... How was it, already... Please no! I'm starting to be ashamed of this speech. As we all, I was full of hope for the new kingdom... full of optimism... And now? Now I feel fears for the royal couple and for the whole of France. How dare you criticize the Crown? You, especially! A few criticisms out loud might help. the Crown to straighten up. If enough of us protest, the wounds of our country will be healed. It's too late ! We don't cure gangrene. We must decide! The Royal Family must be amputated! Shut up ! This is treason! A blasphemy! What's good about wooden soldiers, it is that they are cut with illères! What a crazy evening! We fought, that's all. Nothing serious. It's still strange. Let me help you. Who won ? We ? You wonder what I'm doing here, and i can only answer What a small world. You should be ashamed. You reek of vinasse. What would your father say? How's your head? Disoriented. You should build muscle. You wouldn't have been beaten if you were less frail. Please leave. Did I offend you? Oscar is exhausted, Monsignor. She needs a rest, she's had a hard day. She ? Oscar is a woman? Any fool would see that Oscar is a woman. Excuse me madam. Being a foreigner, I did not know. And forgive me, Lady Oscar. I was starting to worry about myself, because every time I looked at you, my mind was telling me: "This soldier is way too pretty to be a man." I knew this day would come. I should have begged your father to change his mind, but I was too intimidated. Will you forgive your nanny to have kept silent? I would like to be alone. But secrets are meant to be told. And nothing given is free. While Marie-Antoinette was living her passion, The country's eyes were on her. I am upset. An ugly man forced me to watch this horror. It's not for honest people! My poor Queen! Will she survive these calumnies? Excuse my surprise, I didn't know anything about your friendship with Marie Antoinette. I don't report it. Maybe you know why... while I remain his most devoted admirer, she never spoke to me at Court. I am mortified that I cannot serve her. Eminence, you are surely exaggerating. The Queen has never spoken ill of you to me. Dare I ask you to speak to him on my behalf? My Dear Cardinal de Rohan, it would be my dearest desire to strengthen the bonds between two friends. But to be honest, I had to stop my visits to the Palace for financial reasons. My aunt's inheritance is running out, and life is expensive at Versailles. I have unlimited funds! Money doesn't matter to me. I can't accept a loan... A loan ! No way ! A gift, in thanks for a favor. Impossible. Listen to the reason for my request. Thanks to Marie Antoinette, I could become Prime Minister. With this power, I would know how to rid the city of its gossip and protect our beloved Queen from such infamy. In this case, I would be doing the country a service. Let me see ! Do you like this drawing, Oscar? Did Fersen come today? Ten minutes ago. Why ? I have my reasons. Give them to me and I'll tell you where he went. I don't owe you an explanation. I have my reasons. I can read them on your face. I say this to save you from suffering. Where did he go ? In the park. They didn't flatter us. Don't be outraged. I've seen dozens of them. Strange, isn't it, than a simple love between two beings may attract the same contempt as hatred and war. So it's true. Not for a long time. I don't want to jeopardize his future anymore. I'm leaving for America with the Marquis de La Fayette. But there is a revolution out there! The country is on fire and blood! You could die! It would lighten my burden. Will you do me a favor, Oscar? Deliver this farewell to the Queen, I don't have the strength. It is superb. Exactly as I saw it! Everything is there ! The thatched-roof farmhouses, the millstones, the dovecotes... Even the manure heaps! They won't smell? Of course not, Your Majesty. I want nothing to smell or dirty my hands and I wish the peasants weren't old. Milkmaids will have rosy cheeks, and shepherds with broad shoulders. I would like to walk in the paths, picking blackberries thinking of nothing. The hamlet will appear to me like a puppet show. A living tableau where real people will do real things. Hubert Robert will paint the cracks in the walls himself. I will choose every peasant. Whatever you have designed, we will create it for you. Soon we'll be churning butter in a real barn! What worries you, Oscar? I've been trying to talk to you privately for three days, but I haven't had the chance. Why didn't you say anything? The protocol is not in effect here. You can speak to me first. I want to think back to the river. I'm not sure it makes enough sense if it meanders randomly. You can withdraw. You will blame me to spend too much time here and failing in the duties of the Court? No, it's not for me to blame you. I am here to serve you and protect you. You will look at me with those serious eyes and tell me that my affair is known to everyone. You will tell me that a good queen should wait let his youth pass, waiting for the King to satisfy his wife's passions. I would never have this boldness. But that's what you think. I read it on your face. In my defense I will only say that the King is going to undergo a small operation to prepare for marital duty. I'll do mine then giving an heir to the throne. But I won't be satisfied. I won't be because I don't like it. You who are a woman, Oscar, you must know, deep down inside, that our supreme purpose in life is to love and be loved. Am I being blamed for wanting and take what every woman is entitled to have? I bring you this kiss from Count Fersen. These are his farewells. Why make me suffer, Oscar? He left for America. I would have done anything to spare you this pain. I forbid it! I absolutely forbid it! But pass the pain and pass the seasons. The King could finally give an heir. Fersen in the distance waged a bloody war and Marie Antoinette too was giving battle. He's an heir? My friends, we have a new princess. My good man, you will not receive than a quarter of the amount paid for an heir. Alas, Sire, I remembered. Withdraw. The show is over. It's time to go home. Marie-Antoinette repeated the painful exercise several years later in front of a large audience. America was winning the independance War, and she also reached to give France the expected heir. He likes me. He started again! He looked at me and smiled. One day you'll want one too, Oscar. You will see ! Me, Your Majesty? Never ! Why not ? You have everything you need, with one exception. So what am I referring to? To a man, of course. One of those wonderful creatures with hairy hands. Have you ever loved a man? I have a friend whom I love like a brother. And once a man made me feel troubled and confused. If it had been love, you would have known. As soon as I saw my true love, I knew him. Do you believe him dead? I do not know. Who, mom? Who is dead ? I always forget that you can talk. Who is dead ? Tell me. Someone who should have come back a long time ago. I bring you two treasures, my dear. One is a feast for the eyes, the other a treat for the ears. What do you start with? I always look before I listen. Mr Bohmer, if this box contains the necklace you were telling me about, get him out of my sight! In my great weakness, the temptation would be too strong. That's what I hope, Your Majesty! Just a glance, darling. Its brilliance will restore your strength. A real splendor! Say that du Barry whore would have put it around his neck if fate had not struck. The gods knew it would be better to your pretty neck, Majesty, and for one million six hundred thousand pounds, It's an affair. But is it worth my kingdom? The King would send me back to Austria if I presented the bill to him. We could consider conditions. No, I'm not giving in. Maternity did the impossible, I became thrifty. Nevertheless, I thank you and salute you. The second... and true treasure... Wonderful news. Count Fersen is back. When the ladies of the court see her they all want one... in a different shade... Remove the egrets, add peacock feathers. Nobles ruin themselves to make their ladies fashionable. Soon they will be hungry, like us. And we will be responsible for their downfall! I would like that. I hate them all! I only hate the dog that killed my mother. One day, I will go find her at Versailles. You, at Versailles? Let's go! "Madam Rosalie"! Waving the tongue does not work the fingers! Wear this robe to Jarjayes Manor. All the ladies have ordered a dress for the court ball! God knows why! God may not be the only one. Because the Queen's lover has returned... Gossip takes time, and time is money. Quick, my daughter... This dress is for tonight. It's so rare to see you here! Imagine that I have grown a little stronger. I need a touch up for tonight. Is this the Queen's dress? After the touch-up, remove the peacock feathers and replace them with crests like these. On another note, of course. A delivery from Madame Bertin. Are you sure of the address? The Jarjayes sisters are married and have moved away. The name is marked. Come in, I'll ask. I have seen you before but I don't know where. I know you too, sir. I am not a gentleman. Have you ever left horses in the royal stables? No Unfortunately. I want to see Versailles before it disappears. Versailles will disappear? The aristocracy. My friend says she won't be long. It's true, Bernard knows it. He reads Rousseau and Voltaire and frequents the Royal Palace. He should accompany me to Versailles. He would see that they are doing very well. Please take me. I want to see this! I'm on duty. No one will know! I'll hide in your car! Alright, I'll take you. Madame Bertin sends word that the dress is late because... the Queen's lover has returned. What are you saying ? That the Queen's lover has returned. So that's it! Thank God ! I worried. She's putting this on for Fersen? It had to happen, Andre. I don't want to lose her. You have no shame ? It's not about losing it. Be happy that Oscar finally finds himself. Do you think I don't know how you feel? Your nanny hasn't forgotten love yet. It's armor! I can't breathe! No need to breathe. How can I run? You don't have to run. You should walk slowly and smile kindly. You are beautiful. Your presence is like a breeze that refreshes me. You say nothing! A beautiful woman should be quiet. Does a rose respond when spoken to? She just turns her face to the sun and allows passers-by to drink in its beauty. And a snowflake... a snowflake falls silently, stops on a finger and offers a moment of pure perfection before continuing on his way. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Count Fersen from Sweden. Don't you recognize me? If I had ever seen your sweet face I couldn't have forgotten your name. I am Madame de Jarjayes. A cousin of the Queen's Guard? Yes, a cousin. The resemblance is amazing: the same sweet eyes, the same charming smile. Nobody ever noticed it. No one has ever watched Oscar closely. I do, and despite his uniform I find her very beautiful. I see that young man has returned. The one you were dancing with. I danced so much. One who is interested in architecture. That young man! I see he has a new partner. Ah, if Oscar were here. I left her under painful circumstances. And I would like to tell him that I am much better. She would be delighted to hear it. Oscar confessed his affection for you. An affection repaid. I have a confession to make to you. Promise not to tell Oscar again. I never betray confidences. I thought a lot about Oscar during my absence. And in truth... You said ? I was going to say something odd, even to me. That I would probably fall in love with Oscar if I wasn't engaged elsewhere. Poor Oscar. She has no hope with you. I may have said too much. Fear nothing. I will be mute. Oscar and I are not that intimate. It was you who killed my mother! It's you ! You scared me. Have you lost your mind? I love you Oscar. You have no right. You're wrong. I have the right. I have always loved you, and I have the right to continue. I don't complain about not being liked. I pity you for not being able to return it to me. You dared because Fersen loved another. We will act as if nothing had happened. Like those puppets from the Queen's Hamlet. I'll be the invisible stable boy and you the valiant toy soldier. I want everything to stay as before. How sad for both of us, Oscar. I will never touch you again. I promise. Andrew kept his promise. And Oscar put away his robe. Life was going its course. Time flew. Dark clouds were gathering. I could forever behold the beauty. I would like to prevent autumn from becoming winter. I would never like to grow old. Here is the King with the Minister of Finance. I'll pretend they weren't there. Madam, I need to talk to you face to face. Come back in a moment, little ones. It will not be long. You're going to scold me for putting the volcano under construction. I didn't know you were building a volcano. Will it be active? And if so, will it be as explosive that the recent note of twelve hundred and fifty million pounds that you withdrew from the treasury? Impossible ! It's written in black and white. Worse than that, our subjects read it! Since when do people read my accounts? Since I publish the budget. You had no right! I have all the rights! We are heading for disaster! The state debt has reached such monstrous proportions money no longer has value. Raise taxes! The people have been drained of taxes. He's angry. Not as much as me. I incurred your wrath and risked my position to make you see that you have to reduce your expenses. Don't tell me "you have to". So speak. How do you respond to this abominable impertinence? And in my state! I would like to see you return to Versailles. The nobility reproaches you for the time you spend here. And... I feel very lonely without you. I didn't mean to upset you. Get out. First you have to understand that I am not here to torture you. I am here to save your life. I said: Get out! It's my fault ? They blame you for spending too much on me. My beloved, I will leave you if you want. But what would I do without you? God knows I'm deprived of everything else! Dear heart, I will die of boredom. You ? Never ! You will soon experience the happiness of your deliverance. After that, you will find a thousand ways to entertain yourself. The theater, for example. You always wanted to be an actress. What a wonderful idea! What good is a volcano? We will build a theatre! It is not yet possible for me to grant you an audience... Despite my lavish gifts, of our secret correspondence, my beloved queen continues to cruelly ignore me. I lose my Latin there. How badly you know my friend's desperate need to be sure of one's alliances. But how can I assure him of my devotion? There is one last test. The Queen wishes to buy an expensive necklace without the knowledge of the King. And, to prove his confidence, she chose you as an intermediary. I am very touched. To conceal such an expense, she asks you to pay an advance to the jeweler. It will take care of the following payments. In reward, she proposes a secret meeting to thank you personally. His desires are orders. She asks you to bring me the necklace. I'll give it to him and arrange the meeting. With great pleasure. It is my pleasure to assist my friends in their pleasures. This shimmering wonder is going to be mine! How to arrange the meeting? I heard of a lady of the night making a fortune thanks to its striking resemblance to "my friend Toinette". On a dark night, in a dark garden, face concealed... You heard me correctly. We imitated the Queen's handwriting, we will also imitate the Queen. "Imagine "the prettiest little cutie, "sweet, tender, agreeable and fresh, annoying the appetite, "stealth foot, "plump arms, dewy mouth, and hands! "Feet! Teeth! Eyes!" Oscar, reassure me and tell me that I resemble the mischievous Rosine. Keep your straight talk. Am I too old? For me yes, mother. Of course, my darling. You are so young. Be brutally frank, and tell me I'm not going to make a fool of myself! It is possible, Your Majesty. And with brutal frankness, I will tell you that it is very dangerous to introduce "the Barber of Seville" to those he criticizes. The King has banned this play and if you ignore it, you taunt him. Everyone likes to have fun. M. de Beaumarchais is a genius, he is all the rage in Paris. I asked you for an honest opinion. I now forbid you to express an insincere opinion! I ask to be transferred to the French Guards. Because I scold you? It's not a sudden decision. I feel the need to be useful elsewhere. Won't you protect me? Where could you be more helpful? I cherished the times when I served you, but I wonder about my purpose in life. I know the purpose of my life. However, if you want to run lead a regiment of smelly beggars, so be it. I'm transferring you to General de Bouille's Guards. Do not worry. I will protect you. It's very nice of you but I have no need of this protection. I am the queen. Because you are queen, do you know more than the others? God decided that my destiny was to reign. He naturally prepared me for this task. So tell me... Is it true that the good die young? Of course not. I who am of supreme goodness, I am getting older and getting wiser every day. Jeweler Boehmer says it's important. He welcomes that you bought some expensive necklace and hope you haven't forgotten your consent. This fool doesn't know I'm an actress? What is it there? And this ? Don't bother me with these trifles. Tell me the truth. Am I simple and ordinary enough to play Rosine? Where is your sword, soldier? I was crossing a river, my horse slipped, my sword fell, she was swallowed by a big fish. Catch this fish for inspection tomorrow or I will have to reprimand you. I don't know if I will recognize the culprit. I didn't see his face very well. And your sword? I don't know, ma'am. I mean sir. I looked over...she was gone. Take care of yourself ! Head up, and puff out your chest! I will show you my chest if you show me yours. Break ranks! Committed until you change your attitude! I said: Break up! You cut a fine figure in the Queen's Guards. My opinion as a soldier is that you should have stayed there. Thank you for your confidence. My men hid their swords to torment me. Or did they sell them to feed their families? I haven't seen you much. You always leave when I arrive. We no longer eat together, we no longer speak. I miss you. So what is it? We are here... We breathe the same air, alone together... and we miss each other. What are you ? An aristocrat? Better than me? Not better, but different. Separated by the laws I accepted. Separated! Different ! Can't you see that we are equal? That's a very nice word, André, but not reality. It could be reality! Equality exists in America. You can love whoever you want in America. No one is stopping you! Thousands of men paid for it with their lives! I would gladly give my life for equality in France. But you would have nothing. You would be dead. I would have everything. My death would give meaning to my life. And what would I do without you? You would do what you must. You would find your own dream. Your father is waiting for you in his study. You know me ? What do you want ? You. The joke is not funny. It is not. But the humor is there. I convinced your father that he would be wise to reconsider your future and to accede to my marriage proposal. Oscar! It's nothing to laugh about. The Comte de Girodet is immensely rich. You are exciting when you laugh. Are you the same when you cry? My daughter learned not to cry. Unique ! Don't argue with my decision. It is a great pride for me to see the name of Jarjayes united to the powerful name of Girodet. You will be a countess. And you will be richer than you dreamed. You are a mystery that I want to clear up. I will announce our engagement at a ball at my mansion. All I ask of you is a suit that better suits your femininity. A dress as beautiful as the last... a white dress. You must be Andrew. I don't intend to break the friendship that binds you to my future wife. After all, you are almost as pretty as she is. I'm ready to offer you a load valet to the Countess after the wedding. I don't know if that would be wise. I'm clumsy with good wine. I could pull a dagger out of my sleeve and plant it in your heart. I would be within my rights. But I prefer more refined pleasures. I will watch you suffer slowly. Do you accept engagement? I do not have a choice. We all have a choice. I am no longer a domestic. I want to tell you that I'm leaving. How could you believe that I would receive you? Write to you ? To ask foolish favours? My mother despised you, so did I! I now understand that all the letters and documents were forgeries. Jeanne de La Motte deceived me. Where is this woman? I do not know. Do you have the necklace? It is in his hands. Do something ! Stop it! I need to seal your house. My name is one of the most renowned in France. humiliate me like this would arouse the clergy and the aristocracy, we would all pay the price. He's not wrong. In this troubled atmosphere, such a scandal would threaten the entire regime. Let us blame him! I have nothing to hide ! I am Queen, I am innocent, and my name will not be sullied! So what do you want? Let this man stand trial before Parliament! May this woman be hunted down like an animal! And let her be punished! And so it was. The culprit was not the only one punished. The Cardinal was acquitted and Marie Antoinette doomed to open hatred. The storm was approaching, the breeze became a biting wind. Poor girl... Tortured, dragged to the Salpêtrière, victim of the Queen's greed. Or his lust. La Valois confessed to being the Queen's lover. Where did she find the strength after her nights with Fersen? But where is Oscar? Bertin seamstresses work day and night on her dress and her hair is styled by Leonardo himself. Shame. He was such a handsome man. Soon I will call you father, and you will call me son. Imitate Oscar, who has the courtesy to call me Sir. When the heir is born, we'll tell you grandpa. Simple greetings will suffice. Excuse me for letting you go alone, but I was choosing the costume most becoming to my femininity. Do you like my choice? Much better than you would think. We'll see if you still like it at the end of the day. Can I tell you how much you fascinate me. I saw you as soon as you entered, but I never dreamed of being noticed by you. How not to notice you? Those eyes... those lips... You talk about it like a candy... A delicacy, a succulent strawberry. On your next transaction, take a better look at the merchandise. So as not to have to return it. I don't give back what I paid dearly. I scrutinize... I touch... I smell... I dissect to understand the manufacture. Do you like this stuffed falcon? The Marquis de Sade? Fire and ice? Do you like fragrant baths, sleep with silk on the eyes? What a delightful task awaits me to teach you the arts of love, the secret cards of hot encounters. Approach. You disgust me! It's a beginning. Not much, but a start. I like You. I have the right to love whoever I want. I will not marry you. I'd rather marry your dog. Wouldn't that be fun? Our reckless queen and her cowardly husband were not given to us by God. If God is love, He cannot be so cruel. The days of submission are past. It's time to take control of our destiny! We must demand the convocation of the Estates General! demand that our representation is doubled. And that the power of the Third Estate be equal to that of the Clergy and the Aristocracy! Andrew, where have you been? With friends, Bernard and Rosalie. And you, where are you from? I broke off my engagement. You learn. You have already taken the first step. Will you have the courage to break with your past? Do you want to come with me, Oscar? Not now. I can not. Oscar covered his eyes and ears and continued to do his duty. The winds increased in strength, a handful of men became a crowd. The Estates General usher in a new era! The King doubles the representation of the Third Estate! I am happy to be alive today. The riots we feared will perhaps be avoided. Perhaps. I didn't know there were so many and they could scream so loud. They are like a raging ocean that carries away my mother. I tried to make him understand, but she does not listen. I wanted to tell him that life is about change. poor mother, she doesn't believe me. I die, you know. And even that is just changing. France is changing, and I'm changing too. The little prince died and Marie Antoinette paid for the funeral with her silverware. The bell rang for forty hours. But the people had found their voice and no one was listening. In the States General, the controversy raged. Understanding that the power of the people was growing, one hundred members of the clergy and aristocracy joined him. Fearing the rising power of the Third Estate, the court closed the doors of the Assembly. It was too late. The storm had become a hurricane. If we are denied the Assembly, we will go elsewhere, my friends! We are the real National Assembly! We are going to write our own constitution. Clear the streets! Disperse the crowd! Shoot the crowd! Captain de Jarjayes, it's an order! I refuse ! Soldiers! Your captain betrays! Shoot her! We refuse ! You are all at a standstill! Captain de Jarjayes, you will pay with your life! A friend once told me that we are born with the right to choose. I was foolish enough not to believe him. Thanks for not shooting me. I wouldn't have wanted to die without knowing what I learned. I took the risk of coming back to make you understand! This order contradicted all my education! Your duty is not to dispute an order! How do I shoot those I need to protect? I spare you if you swear to let us escape. My name is dishonored, my boy. You better kill me. You're hurt... I will never go home. I have waited so long for these tears. But it is too late. It's time for joy. My beloved children... You are free... You are free to listen to your hearts. Do not worry about me. The joy of seeing you reunited fills me forever. I can't help it anymore. Tomorrow I will denounce these two fleeing traitors. The army may have trouble finding them. The people of Paris are no longer made up of anything but traitors. Then the people must be exterminated. We must maintain order so that the world remains the same. Be brave. It's time to be brave. The army fired on the people. Troops arrive from all over Europe. The cannons of the Bastille point towards the Hôtel de Ville and the Palais-Royal. Tomorrow morning, the citizens will arm themselves and take the Bastille before it's late. I do not want to leave you, but I have to go with them. I come with you. I couldn't bear to lose you. But you have to run that risk. That's all that matters, you said. I love you, Andre. Despite the raging storm, the morning of July 14 was radiant. The King was preparing to go hunting and prayed to the Lord for game to abound. The Queen awoke in her lover's arms and listened to the distant rumble. She thought it was the summer wind. Let's run away before it's too late. I am not afraid. I did them no harm. I am their queen. High waves stirred the sea The ship was sailing under full sail The captain exclaimed.. "Turn around l" But his voice is lost... The wind moans, the sea responds "In no port can you moor. "I will know how to seize you "Training yourself into the deep abyss..." I struggle to find the rhyme But my mind is absent I do not have time... The Bastille is taken! Have you seen Andre? We have taken the Bastille!
