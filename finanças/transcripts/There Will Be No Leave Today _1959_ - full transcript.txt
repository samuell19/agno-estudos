Kotochev A production of the VGIK and of the Central Study of the Television (1958) Everybody want that the city to be pretty. But, how? Let us take the Kirov street. It has been asphalted. Two months of work! The asphalt was still hot when a municipal brigade arrived and rip it off to do a trench. and You speak of planning. But, what to do if each one goes to his? The municipal committee! - Don't worry. Stop screaming. - The municipal committee! Give me Verchinine! Verchinine! Verchinine speaking. What? Missiles? Yes... Yes. Very well. Yes. Comrades, On Sovietskaia street, near school 34, they have found missiles. - Are there many? - Around thirty tons. - And the problem is really mine. - What do you think we shall do? It has been prohibited to touch them. The missiles have been 15 years under earth. Circulate! - Are they as dangerous as before? - More than ever! It is not possible to touch them. If they explode, they will do it with the same violence as fifteen years ago. Would it be necessary to explode them on the spot? - It is what the instructions say. - And then? You know what it means to explode them in this city? Thirty tons of explosives? - Stop. - Stop. - What is it? - A new building. Well, after the explosion of this building, it will be all ruins. - What do we do then? - I have no idea. The only thing to do is to transport them far away. But it will be with risk of our lives. Yes, today we will not be able to leave our positions... Citizens, circulate! There is no danger, circulate! Do not remain here, circulate! DANGER: NO ENTRY There are already ruins here. We are not in war, I cannot send my men to death. And for us... it is inconceivable that our city flies in pieces. Pardon, comrade colonel but if I were able, - I would transfer those damn missiles myself. - But you are not able to! No. And you? - You cannot pass! - I have to. - It is prohibited. Did you not see the cord? - I know it, I know the orders... You are not needed here. You cannot pass, understand? We shall go, Morozov. You want to send these men to clear mines? They are fed up to keep this zone! What do you want? I want to work with you. I was fireman during the war. For seven years. Then... do you take me? To do what? To transport the missiles. No. It would be too much responsibility. Go away. Comrade, one missile makes a noise. It is because of the sun. Take off your jacket. Shall I regroup people? It's bad. A sparrow settles and... it salutes to the company! Who is of permission? - I. - I. This does not concern you... Those that want to follow me must reflect this. This is going to be very hard. If I understand it right, you want to help us. If you are serious, yes. But tell me frankly: yes or no? One monent. Then, Galitch, what do we have? Thirty tons. More or less. The rest is clear. - It will be made tomorrow, if it goes well. - Well. It creates problems for me to choose the conductor. I think about Sadovnik, but I do not know. He is a novice. He just arrived. - I understand, captain! - Comrade colonel! Do you come? It is necessary to do something! I come. Vassili Makarytch... No. You have been a soldier... you know perfectly well that I cannot take you. Let the captain do his job and everyone else do theirs! I understand. Good luck! Thanks. What happens? Calm, comrades! Comrades, a group of soldiers directed by captain Galitch will transport the missiles far from the city... You envy them? I am going away to water the flowers. - Don't you sleep? - I wanted to smoke. Let us hope that it does not rain tomorrow. - Do they sleep? - Yes. - Have you seen the conductor? - Yes. - And...? - I do not know what to say... he is young. - Sleeping? - Surely.
