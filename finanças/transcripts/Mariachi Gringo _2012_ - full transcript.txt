Ed? Are you about done with that? Sorry, I didn't know you were back. What in the world made you get that thing out? What do you want to do for dinner tonight? How about El mariachi? Let's think about that for next Sunday. Give your dad fair warning. It's food, not a tornado. Shit! Did you call Tammy back yet? I'm sure she'd love to go. How do you even know that she called? Ed? Ed! Fine. I'll just be the only woman trying to make your life a little brighter! Buenas noches. That was great. I kind of heard something about a wandering horseman and a broken heart. I wish my Spanish was a little better. A horseman wanders along a far-away mountain with a wounded heart, a broken soul, looking for death. He prays to god to take his life so he may be reunited with his lost love. Without what he loves more than life itself, life isn't worth living. Written by Mexico's best, Jose Alfredo jimenez. Died very young, 47. You can shut him up any time, hmm? Your Margarita is melting. No, it's fine. That's a beautiful guitar. You play? I used to. Bring your guitar by sometime. Um, I don't want to torture you. I haven't touched it in years. Don't worry. I'll teach you Jose's song. It's cold out tonight. Happens this time of year. Bet you can't wait for the spring, right? No, I can't. But I will make do. I got you something from El mariachi. Oh, they got corn at uncle bill's too. Yes, this is better. Oh, really? Mexicans invent corn? Actually yeah, they did. Mom, just try it, it's good. It's different. But good. Go! Go! Oh jeez! Oh... You and dad ever really talk anymore? After thirty-five years, we don't have to. Well you've know me for thirty years and we still talk. You don't hardly know anything about me. Of course I do. I know everything. And by the way, you're still twenty-nine. And by the way, I think it's nasty you clean with old underwear. A rag is a rag. Are those mine? Yep. Take 'em. Honey, here's that story. A suspicious device was discovered this morning. The device was just a toy horse. And the bomb squad blew it up just a short time ago. Dumbasses. Honey, are you keeping up on your meds? Mom. Is the anxiety still bad? I really, really don't want to talk about this. Fine. Talk to Dr. Roth. He's good for more than just a refill. He's a pediatrician. Well, he put you on them. I told him I was tired and unmotivated, and he put me on a pill more addictive then cocaine. I mean... Well, he was just trying to help. Ed? Go go postal, to where can I help your post go go? Ten to four on weekdays. Yeah, thanks. Bye. Come on, sugar. Go see mom. See you over there in a half hour. Okay. Would you like one? Hi, there. You got enough to see us through? We only have fifteen minutes. Oh, poo. We do, don't we? I almost forgot. Ed... You remember what I said about the end of the summer? Yeah, you said I'd be able to take a vacation. Well, that vacation may be longer than you planned. I just don't think I have enough work to keep you going. Oh, ed. Lo siento. I hate the fall. Looks like I lost the bet. He hasn't stopped talking about you coming over to play. I mean, he can't get my daughters to listen to mariachi music, let alone go anywhere near a guitar. Well, that's their loss. Yeah, well maybe you can inspire them to pick up the torch. Come on, we're all outside. So, these are my cousins, and my aunts, my uncles... Morales, Lucinda, may, and there's Nancy and Jesus. So eat and papito will be up any minute. He's just raising the flag over his little palacio municipal. All right? Okay. Okay. I don't want to sound like an idiot, but what's the holiday? Mexican independence. Have you guys been to Mexico? Well, Carmen's been to Tijuana. No, I haven't. She says it's nasty. Ed! Hey. I hope you came prepared. Well, I promised you, didn't I? Even if it was Tequila talking. Good! You crash my party, you better be ready to entertain. C. G7. You know that? Uh-huh. F. G. Haven't touched it in years? My foot. It was great! Viva Mexico! Viva Mexico! Viva Mexico! Watch your head. Welcome to Guadalajara! Wow. This is it. Plaza de los mariachis. Is that where they play? Not for free, unless they are auditioning. It's where they hang out to wait for customers. This is us in the Plaza, young and optimistic. Is that you in the middle? Yes. Take it. Let our confidence inspire you. Again, again. Let your shoulders go. Were you guys famous? No, not at all. Mariachi, at least then, wasn't a way to be famous. Wasn't even a goal. We were happy just playing to feed our families. Sounds perfect. It gave me a sense of duty, to bring music to people at all the important moments in their lives. He has blond hair. No, no, no. Up here. Play with confidence! Confidence! Mariachi brings all kinds of people together. Poor, rich, young, old... Even you and me. Yes! Yes! Great! This is... Different. Enchiladas con mole... It's papito's absolute favorite, eh? It's definitely no burrito. No, it's good. Mariachi is the soundtrack of life in Mexico. It gives a voice to our suffering and to our joy. To our pain and yes, to our pleasure. To us, Eduardo. To the soundtrack of life. Promise to keep that sense of duty. I promise. Do you ever think about going back? This is my Mexico now. I always thought I'd run away. After I finished high school, that was my plan. You know, for the fall. To play music? Or something else unrealistic. Why don't you go down to Guadalajara, see the mariachis for yourself. Yeah, right. I was unhappy at your age, too. I followed a dream here, so I'd never look back and wish I'd done things differently. Took more guts than I have. Nonsense. There's no sin in failing. The sin is never trying in the first place. You off work today? Mom didn't tell you? Tell me what? Never mind. See ya. It's nice to see you with that guitar again, ed. I'll take these. Alberto? Hey. Where is everybody? Grandpa's in the hospital. All we know is it's a stroke. Rosario: Oh, well look who's here. He's finally awake and very happy to see you two. Hola, Alberto. We brought grandpa's guitar. You wanna play something? No, I haven't even learned a full song, so... Anything. I can't. I'm sorry. ♪ Thou fire so masterful and bright ♪ ♪ That givest man both warmth and light ♪ Tammy, that song you sang this morning was very nice. Wasn't it, ed? Your dad told me you play guitar. Maybe we could put together a song. You don't play guitar. Once upon a time, Ed was gonna run away with a band. Tammy, tell about that miracle with your sister last month. You know that school bus that rolled over in utica on its way to a field trip? My sister was going the opposite direction and it was her SUV that went over with it. She was in terrible shape... Unconscious, on all the machines. But we prayed so hard. Anne came down, didn't you? I did. I thank the lord about every minute for letting her stay with us. He must've known she had more to offer this world. Didn't a little girl get crushed under that bus? Ed. Her family must not have prayed hard enough. Or maybe you should've prayed harder since it was your sister's SUV that smashed her. Take a deep breath. Look I'm sorry if I'm being naive here. Enough, Edward! I guess I just don't get how it works. I mean... what she's saying is that this little girl has nothing left to offer this world, right? Shut the hell up, freak! I'm sorry. Wasn't that bad, was it? It's a start. Oh, no, thanks. No, gracias. Hola. Good afternoon. How much? Diez pesos. That ok? Bueno? No, I don't have change. No, no, no. Diez pesos. It's ok? It's enough? Hola. Hola. Um, what happened to the arch? White arch? They took it down for this. It's not here? No. Okay, gracias. De nada. Hey. Hey. Americano? Si. Got some change to spare? Lo siento. Need to get some food. No, sorry. No. Hey, hey. - Anything? - No, I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry. Hey. Hey! Go sit over there. Don't move! Is this man bothering you? Uh, lo siento, no habla español. Is that man bothering you? No, it's fine. It's okay. You have ID? ID? Yeah, okay. What's that? Drugs? No, it's definitely not drugs. No, it's not... Hey, hey, hey! It's not mine. You can search the rest of my stuff. We could release you... You have to pay the fine now. How much? Two hundred dollars. American. No, I don't have that much. What's going on? Go back inside and mind your own business. Release him! Or do you want me to get Chief Arango? Should I call him? Or are you going to release him? Fuck you, gringo! You assholes give Mexicans a bad name. Si. Ah, si, si, si. Hello, Edward. Hola. Welcome. Thank you. Are you allright? Yeah. You look like you need this. Thank you. For everything. De nada. So you're from Kansas? Yeah. You looking for your way back home? Huh? From oz? I'm Lilia. That was fast. It's better if you just sip it. Sorry. Mole poblano. All right. Uh, actually I need to practice my Spanish. Okay? Yeah. Lilia: Thank you. You seem adventurous. Sure. Thank you. Enjoy. Gracias. How much do I owe? La cuenta? Okay. Gracias. De nada. Do you know where you're sleeping tonight? Of course. There are rooms for rent next door. NO VACANCY Okay. Lo siento. Thanks. 1500 pesos a week. Oh, good! Wow, that's cheap. Uno week. Happy Birthday, my love! Do another! &quot;mexico lindo y querido.&quot; &quot;mexico lindo y querido.&quot; no, I don't know how to play that. Everyone knows it. Lo siento. You hungry for comida? I hope you slept through that mariachi nightmare. It's usually quieter around here. Hello? Well, if you need anything I'll be downstairs. Oh... and you have plans for Tuesday night. You get off the tren ligero at mezquitan. You come up the steps. I'll be waiting. Hello? Hey, is dad watching the game? Where the hell are you? Ron! Didn't you get my note? I got the damn note. Where are you? I'm in Mexico. Mexico! Oh, my god. Ron, pick up! You need to come home right now. No, I don't mom. I'm fine. Ed... Hey, dad. Your mom and me talked it over and we decided we'd pay the rent for an apartment for six months to get you back on your feet. Thanks dad, but no. I need a break. You can't just call and tell us you're in Mexico. Well, I just did, mom. I'm an adult. You barely even go to the grocery by yourself. Exactly. There was a story on the news just last night about beheadings down there. I just wanted to call to tell you I'm safe, okay? Mom, I'm not going to stay here all night, right? Speak Spanish. I'm opening the restaurant in the morning. You'll stay until 1:00. Where are you going? For Edward. Lilia! I'll be right back. Geez. Ay, dios. Let her be. You were young once. And I sat here all night if I wanted to or not. Trick or treat? Thanks! De nada. But we don't really do trick-or-treat here. Oh. Sorry, uhh... Do you want to keep them anyway? Yeah, of course. Okay, okay. So, no trick-or-treating? That's kind of a shame. Wow. All this for the dead? Mostly for the living. Ha. Mama, cihtli. This is Edward. Welcome. You can sit here. Eat something, child. Cihtli is saying you should eat something. Gracias. Is it good? I'm sorry. Gracias. So, when are you going to sing me a song? Huh? Yeah. It could be &quot;Cielito lindo&quot; Or &quot;De colores.&quot; sorry, am I way too loud? I knew it! Yes! Okay. Are you trying to be a mariachi or something? You think that's crazy? Ahh... I think you're in the right place. Yeah, there's nothing else here but rice and beans and mariachis. So, people won't laugh at me? I didn't say that. No, but you have to believe it, otherwise no one else will. I think some people might make fun of a gringo wanting to be Mexican. But, I say screw 'em. Really? Yeah, screw 'em! Okay, 'cause I've been trying to figure this all out. Without much luck. How many songs do you know? Just a few so far. You know there's, like, three thousand. And you need to know them as requested. I kinda figured that one out, yeah. I'll take care of everything. What do you mean? I know people. No, no. I know you're busy. Ahh, shh. Really, I'm in charge. I'm in charge, yes. Really? Mm-hmm. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. It's like this, like this. So, what are you going to do for me in return? Anything. Just name it. Marry me. So I can go to the U.S. Really? Oh, that's funny. Okay, gracias. Try me out. I know your favorites. No. Lilia? Oh, those go over there. No, it's ok, I got it. Hey, are you sure your mom's okay with me working here? Are you sure you can work for Mexican pay? Will you teach me? I can see it now... The backstreet mariachi boys. No way, no. The girls will be screaming their heads off for you! No, I want to be a simple mariachi of the people. I don't think I've ever met anyone so sincere. It might seem silly, but I don't want to be rich and famous. Okay. Oye, mijo, no, no, no. They're not pancakes. They're tortillas. Not like that. Like this. Okay, okay. Ever been in California? Uh, no. It's perfect there, and there's tons of mariachis. You've been? Mm-hmm. For university. I studied ocean science in Santa Cruz. No, no, no. You're burning them. Flip them. Okay. Si. Wait? - She lived in the USA? - Yes. Yeah, until mamacita dragged me home. Kicking and screaming. I lived there with my brother and his wife. So why kicking and screaming? I love someone in California. Well, loved. You know. Past tense. And the pacific ocean, the reason I went there in the first place. But mariachis there are so cute! Mexican girls drool over them. Like drool over them. I just wanna hear more about Mr. California. I'm sure you will. Gracias. It must've been hard to leave, no? Would've been harder to stay. Don't you miss home? Your parents must be crazy you're gone. I don't know. Come on. Yes, you do. I miss the smell of November. And my dad's chili. And the mothball smell of the Afghan my mom made me when I was a kid. Sounds nice. I have to go back to Santa Cruz. It's perfect there. I think you're missing Mr. California. No. It's the ocean. The ocean is my dream. Isn't that same ocean that's a couple hours west of here. It's not the 'same' same. No. This is for you. It's a love bird. Is it? Yep. I guess it needs a mate then. Two tequilas with sangrita. So, what does she look like? Dark long hair. Gorgeous. Well, that's every woman in here. Is Sophia here yet? There she is. Pray that she says yes. Pray. Okay, okay. Una mas. Hola. Hola. It's been too long! OK, look. That must be your friend. Yes. He's nervous. Will you meet him? Si! She said she'll meet you. Is that her mariachi band? Oh, no, they wouldn't be caught dead here. Do you mind? No... it's cool. You look lonely. Wanna dance? Lo siento... I'm not... Come on! No, I'm not... Si, vamos. I'm not starting completely from scratch. I play guitar and I sing a little bit. Most of this music needs to be learned by ear. I'll do whatever it takes. I just really want to learn. We know he's not picky. He'll do anything. Hey, hold on. I had no idea what that guy was saying. What was I supposed to do? 'No' means the same in Spanish. No. No. No. I'm cool with it, it's fine. I'm very comfortable with my sexuality. So, are you two together? Oh, god no! Might have worked out better. Sophia's like my big sister. She was engaged to my brother before he went to the states. Met a gringa lady. No offense. No, no. Left me for dead. Sorry about that. I'm okay. If you're committed to this, I'm in. Really? Thank you so much. Honestly, thank you. What? What is that? Thank you, thank you so much. No, you have to be more excited! I am excited. I'm excited. Really excited! Really. What? Scream it! Scream what? Scream, &quot;I'm gonna do it!&quot; I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it! Have you ever been in love with a man? No. Well, I don't know. Why? Does it matter? So, are you bi or what? Why does everyone want to know that? I fell in love with a woman. So what. I mean, it doesn't matter to me. But I think people just want to know if you're available. Shut up and sing me a song. Come on, please. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay. I just started practicing this one... play. Okay. Bravo! Thank you. Hey. What are you doing in my bed? Are the flowers ready, Grandma? Yes, and they are beautiful today. Lilia, I need to speak to you. I don't care if he already bought you the place - or the whole fucking city! I can't handle two restaurants. Don't force me to sell this one. I only came back to help when Father died. Only for that. Your brother works very hard. He's doing this for us. So, it's OK for your son to abandon you for the USA- and a gringa bitch! Lilia! What if I want to go back and work really hard? Huh? This is what your father dreamed of his whole life. Exactly - Father dreamed of it. Not me! He dreamed it for you. For me, for all of us. What about my dream? This location would be yours. To run, to manage yourself once we have the new one. Don't think I'm going to spend my whole life sweating in this stupid kitchen. I'm not going to. Sorry I'm late, Señora. It won't happen again. I promise. Sorry. I'll catch up. You're late! I just got a call. A mariachi wants to meet me, mariachi alas? They sound interested. Alas? Yeah. You know, they're not simple musicians of the people. They're big, like famous. I already told them I'd meet them. Do whatever you want. Hi. You the guy I'm supposed to meet? Jorge? Hey. I'm sorry. Edward. Nice to meet you. ¿Tu American? Si, yeah, but I live here now. I'm leaving right before the festival. We're looking for someone great. Can you come play for us? Audition? Audition? Yes, of course. Si. A week from Friday. Uh, next Friday? Si, no problema. Perfecto. Gracias. Edward... You play vihuela, right? Of course. Father didn't pay for university so... I could make tortillas the rest of my life. So what are you going to do? Run off with that American? You wish. So, I finally got an audition. Audition? For what? I actually got one. For a mariachi band. Like, a real one. It's almost Christmas, ed. We haven't heard from you in weeks. Don't you think it's about time you came home? You ever check your email? Hey son. You need any cash? No, I'm fine. Everything's great. What are you doing for insurance and such? Anne... You better still be on your pills. I'm fine. I'm careful. Careful don't cut it. You can't mess around with this stuff, ed. Okay, I'm sorry I bothered you. Just wanted to tell you the good news. Rise and shine, sleepyhead. All right, screw the restaurant. We have one week to turn you into an expert mariachi. So, let's do it. Good morning! I love this one. What's the price? I think he said 8500. Let me go ask. 8500 is a little steep. It's handmade. If you want to be a true mariachi, you need a "Morales." This is all I have in writing. These are required. Sweetie, this was your parents' dream. They need you. No. Again, from here. With feeling. Damn it, teach me again. You're young. You have time. You remember how to grind those? I do. No. Like this. It's finer this way. This is the part cihtli made my brother and me do. We'd grind until our hands were numb. It was her wedding day meal. Her mother made it as a symbol for her union with a Spanish man. She isn't Spanish? Nuh-uh. Nahua. Indian. Mother is El mole. She was supposed to make it for my wedding. Sounds nice. Please. As if that's possible. So your mother's never met any of your girlfriends? That's funny. You never told them? What's to tell? The truth. ¿La verdad? La verdad. And what is that? I told her I'd do the restaurant. I made my choice. I'm going to be a good daughter now. So, you're going to have to find a new chaperone. Hey. What? Have you thought this through? What about the ocean? Stop the therapy. I made my decision. Sorry. Edward. Hola. - How are you? - Good. You? Come, let me introduce you. This is Edward. The guy I told you about. Hola. Hola. Tequila con limon. Tequila con limon. Starts with c, then goes to c7. I got this one. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, we have fresh meat for you tonight! That's me. Hay! Uno, dos... What'd I tell you? Blond hair and blue eyes! Yes, it's good. Welcome. Gracias! Gracias! Lilia, hey. Why? Stop. Why? Stop. Stop! Let's go. I need air. What's wrong with you? Gracias, señora. Look, I bought you a rose. Hey, baby. You putting on a show? What do you want? You want to stay and see? You like to watch, do you? Nice tits. Too bad they're wasted on a dyke. No, there's some here for you, too. You want them? How delicious! I'll make you feel things no bitch ever could. Go away! Hey! What the hell is going on? It's under control. Listen. Have some dignity. Get your hands off her. No. You go away. Go away. If you're not going to give me what I want. Just go away. Lilia, come on. No, no, no. Come on. Who are you? A fucking queer? No, asshole. I'm a gentleman. Real man. No wonder the bitch wants to be with a real man. Fuck you! Go fuck your mother! Get out of here! I'm gonna kick your fucking face in! Come on! Kill the macho attitude. It doesn't suit you. Lilia, come on. I'll walk you home. No. Break. You two need a break. Yeah. Hold on. Hey. Hey. Come on in. I'm sorry to wake you up. Your mom called. She said you should call her back today, it's important. Okay, thanks. Oh, so you got your uniform and everything? Uh, yeah. Picked it up yesterday. So it's good? It's great. I mean, rehearsals are killing me, my fingers are hamburger. But it's perfect. Edward! Edward! You need to take care of those. Those are your tools, you know. So, we've got the restaurant to ourselves. I'm sure my mom is going to come often. You think the band can come in and play sometime? This isn't what you want. Of course it is. No, this. All of this. I don't have a choice. Of course you do. Just leave, make a change. No, it is. It's not that easy. No, it's not. Lilia. It's not. It's not easy. It is. It is. No, it's not! I can't leave my mom by herself. Not everyone can be you. I'm not telling you to be me. I'm telling you to be you! That didn't work for you. Did it? You were on your way to being you. Remember? Simple musician. What happened? Mariachi alas? Look, I don't know. I'm along for the ride. Why me? Why me? Why Mexico? Why mariachi? Alberto told me a story about a man. He was unable to have the only thing in life he truly loved, he stopped wanting to live. I've never loved anything enough to feel that. I just needed to know it was possible. Turns out it is. Buy a ticket. Get on a plane or a bus or a boat. Just go. It's easy. Maybe for a gringo. You know what, fine. Whatever. Just be miserable. And be bitter. I mean, why don't you marry me while you're at it? You're generous... Beautiful, supportive. So, why don't you? Will you marry me? Stop it. I didn't think so. It's not what you want. How do you know what I want? You want to feel what I just felt. It's peace. It's joy. It's love. I promise. It's what we all want. Yeah, I've got the big festival tonight. Well, it's actually right now. The guys are waiting. But Lilia said you wanted to talk. Yes. A lady named rosario called asking for you. You know her? Yeah, she's from the restaurant in town. Well, I don't know her, so I didn't tell her you were in Mexico, but she told me she really needed me to let you know that papito died. Was that your friend? Yeah, he's dead? Oh, my god. We wanted to tell you we're sorry to hear about your friend. You want us to send flowers or a plant or something? I gotta go. I miss you two. The next group tonight is from right here in Guadalajara. An extraordinary mariachi. Let's welcome them to the stage. Ladies and gentlemen - An old band, with a new name. Mariachi Gringo! What happened to Mariachi Alas? Come on. Listen to the crowd. Am I actually good enough for your band? Or do you just want me as a joke? Don't be offended, it's good for business. For Alberto. Viva Mexico. We even brought a stereo to the home last winter. We drove those nurses nuts with that mariachi music. We never knew if he could actually hear it. I'm sure he heard it. So how is it down there? You like it? Yeah, I really do. You know, I've never been. To Guadalajara? To Mexico. Maybe now. So, I've been putting some red bell pepper in my meatloaf. It's different. But good. You like it? It's good. What do you think, Brendan, you think Ed should give Brian a call? Yeah. He said he could probably start you out in the office, work your way up like me. What a good idea, honey. I'm so glad you thought of that. Mom. We talked about this, right? Okay. Just tell us why you want to live in a third world country? Leave the kid alone. It's good to have you back at the dinner table, ed. Thanks, dad. Yeah, you two should come visit. See for yourselves. Honey, wait. You didn't try your Pesto. I made it fresh. I do not eat newfangled food. They've been makin' Pesto for thousands of years in Italy. Well, they haven't been making it for thousands of years in Kansas now have they? Brendan: I bet if you deep fried it he'd eat it. Oh, Brendan! Hola. You missed her by a week. Really? Lilia returned to Santa Cruz. Is there anything I can help you with? We're fine, thank you. Okay. Good morning! Please come in, make yourself at home. Pour them a drink. I want the best for my ladies. Go call them in. My mother's favorite song is "Paloma Negra." My wife will love anything, so play your favorites also. Absolutely. With pleasure. Happy Mother's Day! I invited mariachis. Thank you. Best wishes. Thank you. Please eat. I have beans, soup, cactus, and tequila. Thank you for inviting me. Thank you, Edward.
