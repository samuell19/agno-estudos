Wake your narrow ass up! Rise and shine, boy! You act like you pay the bills up in here. I told you, the only one that's laying up in here is me! Damn! Another wet dream. Oh, yes... Oh, yes! Ooh...oooh! I'm coming...I'm coming! Ooh! That's what I'm talking about. [Knock on door] Chuck! You've been in there for an hour. Let me in! Mama! Mama! Chuck's hogging up the bathroom again! Damn! Can't a brother handle his business? Can't a sister get in the bathroom? Nope, there's nothing better than having your hand as a girlfriend. My baby...[Kiss] Ohh...trey! Come back to bed. Come satisfy me with that...Big... Lollipop. [Telephone rings] Hello? Hello, can I speak to Mira? Mira? Mira who? My right nut in your mouth! Yo, where Perry at? Chuck, is that you? I thought your phone got shut off. You calling from your neighbor's again, huh? Perry, phone! It's that black termite again! Shut your little stupid ass up. What's up, fool? What you doing? Ah, man. Just sitting here chillin', man. I'm trying to get myself out quick, man, before my parents have me doing some shit. Let's hit up Trey and meet up at the speezee. Sure. Call him. Hold up. [Telephone rings] [Ring] Hello? Who this be? Trey, this is Joe. Joe? Joe who? Joe mama, fool! Yo, get ready, man. We're about to roll to the speezee, dawg, so we call roll this bleezee! All, right, fools. I'll be there in a second. I got to wait for enchilada to sneak out of here. Oh, man...Sneak out! Even Stevie wonder can see that fat bitch trying to sneak out! You better roll her out like a tortilla and get to the spot before you fuck up the rotation. I'll be there in a bit, all right? Peace. All right. All right. Later. See, these kids are doing it all wrong today. We used to be sweet back in the old days. Old school, that's what I'm taking about. Write love letters, send them roses, have them eating out of the palm of our hands. We were smooth. We knew how to rap. We talked to the women. Then they'd give us anything we wanted. Nowadays, like I tell my son Perry, all they going for is the sweet potato pie. Boo-ya! They're looking for instant gratification. It ain't happening. The women don't like that. They're doing it all wrong. They got to go back to the old school. The old days, it's the only way. Perry! Perry! Yeah? Before you take your trifling ass anywhere, I have a few things I want you to do for me. What, mama? Dang! I need you to wash the car, mow the lawn, clean the dishes, do the laundry, pick up tay tay, take out the trash, vacuum, and clean the toilets. And by the way, paint the house. What? And when you're done with that shit, then you can go hang with your friends. Mama, by the time I finish that that's going to be next year. What's peaches doing? Remember she did it last time. We're gonna get our nails done. See ya. Hey, man, did you see j.Lo on bet last night? She was looking like a whopper. That ass is phat! I'm tired of being a virgin. Me, too. What the fuck is wrong with y'all? Being a virgin is the greatest gift a fool can have. Yeah, right, Chuck. How many niggers you know that are still virgins? Well...3. Who? Yo-- you, me, and Trey. Oh, man. Yo, dude, you forgot about Malone. Malone? Malone who? My lone-ass dick, motherfucker. Anyways, it's true. Personally, I don't see anything wrong with us being virgins. Someday we'll find us some virgin females or something. Yo, Chuck, when? When's this gonna happen? I don't know. Just be patient. Man, Patience is all I have, and I'm having wet dreams about Halle Berry. Relax, Perry. Use your hand, Perry. It helps. You're a sick motherfucker. What? I agree with Perry, man. Why don't we just find us some hos, get busy with them? Hos? Are you serious, Trey? What happened to that fat-ass piñata girlfriend of yours? Ain't she 30 or something? Look, fools, first of all, she's not fat, she's just big-boned. Second of all, she's not 30-something, she's just 30. Yeah right. Whatever. Same thing. No, it's not, man. Look, enchilada and I, we've never done nothing together, man. We ain't even had sex. Y'all never had sex? Man, how long y'all been together? Like a week. A week, and you still haven't hit that shit? What the fuck y'all be doing then? You know, we, uh-- we kiss. Shit like that, man. Shit like that? Man, it's got to be more to it than that. What else y'all do? Well, uh-- you know, she, uh... Look, the only reason I'm still a virgin is simple. I'm waiting for the right girl. You know, light skin, long hair. They in style right now. Mariah Carey's making a comeback. Just turn on bet. She's all over the place. But on the real-- you cannot rush into things like this. A player has got to take his time. If you're going to meet a girl, maybe hit, whatever, play it by ear. Just watch the Mac do his thing. That's if I get a chance, man. My mom got me doing these damn chores. Girl, you are too funny, ok? Wait a minute. Hold on one second. I'll be right back. So, here's what you need to do to get with this sweet potato pie. You got to invest in this shit, baby. I need my hair done, my nails done, have a fendi bag and a fly whip to roll around in. Do you smell me? You ain't invested in this yet. If you can't take care of a real sister, you need to get like Michael and beat it. 'Cause we're tired of you busted-ass niggers rolling around in your mama's car. Check that. Girl, let me tell you what's going on with this guy. He is all about lovin', ok? Like that, Trey? Damn, girl... You like that, papi? Papi like, papi love. How much you like that, papi? I'm going to show you how much right now. I'll show you! Here it comes. Here it comes. Oh, shit. My bad. I didn't feel it coming on so soon. That's for my westside boys. Let me grab you a wet-nap or something. That's all she does, dudes, so, uh, technically speaking, I'm still a virgin. You got to get your head right, man. What? Man, you all fools. All that pussy and all you do is let that fat bitch Jack you off? What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you scared? Man, if you think I'm going to lose my virginity to some fat ugly bitch then you're wrong, dawgs. Trey gonna get broken off by a proper female, like Beyonce. What the fuck are you with her fat ass for then? To keep you warm in the winter? I don't know, man. You know, spur of the moment. You know how we do it. I don't care. Pussy's pussy. That's right. Let me see an old-ass lady about 80 or something walking with a cane down the street-- I'll hit that saggy old-ass pussy any day. What? Who's the sick motherfucker now? Yeah. Anyways, yo, t? What's your girl's name again? Enchilada. What the fuck? Enchilada? Where'd you meet that girl at, del taco? No. Man, just lay off her. Brother, that's your job. Enchilada may be fatter than a mother-- all right, I'll give you that-- but she's still all that and a bag of chips. Yeah, sure she is. And another bag, and another bag, and another bag. Man, fuck you all! And another bag... Ah, don't dis my bike. My grandma gave me that. Your sister gave it to you. Oh, Trey... Man, I've been trying to get laid since I was 16. Getting some ass can cost a grip. I can't even get past first base without having to take a girl to the movies or to lunch and shit. I'm still trying. But just wait. I've got something for the honies. They're not going to pimp me. If anything, I'm going to have her ass out there bringing the money home to daddy. That's the problem with y'all niggers today. You want it all for nothing. Let me tell y'all a little something-something. If you can't buy me Gucci, you can't have this coochie. Plain and simple. Look, all bullshit aside, I say we get some coochie right now or as soon as possible. Man, I don't know. My girlfriend might not be too happy with that. Girlfriend?girlfriend? Yeah...handy. I call my girlfriend, which happens to be my right hand. She's there for me when I need her. She's also free. She just asks that I keep her massaged up with lotion. What? I'm just playing, dawg. Them's a joke. Yo, for real. I plead the 5th. Yeah. Me, too. Anyway, y'all going to lose your virginity this week or what? Oh, man! My dick's getting hard just thinking about these hos. What's there to think about anyway? Either we're down or we're not. What's it gonna be, pimps? I'm in. Cool. Chuck? I don't know. Nigger! Hmm... Let's see. Pussy...handy. Pussy...handy. Pussy...handy. It's pussy. And let's go get it. Cool. Hey, yo, man-- where're we going? We're going over to my heezee. Why? To figure out how to get the pussy. Oh, for real? Come on. Ok, ok. I could have had coochie a long time ago. Perry and Chuck-- they don't know what's crackalackin'. [Dogs barking] I hear you, pooches. You know what I'm saying? I realize you got to be smooth with the ladies to get what you want. You got to tell them whatever the hell they want to hear. You know? Believe me, dawg, it works like magic. Just ask enchilada. Actually, you know what? Scratch that. That's a bad idea. I'm just test-driving her for now. I'm waiting for the fine Princess of my life to come rolling up on me. She's going to be asking me out. I ain't got to do none of the grunt work anymore. Although I can be smooth. This is Trey you're talking to. Ha ha! Put up a little rhyme. I got a bunch of money in my hand. It's coming, too. We shall see. Ah, man, I got this, man! Yo, Chuck, hand me a pen and a piece of paper. It's about to be on! Yeah, I'm talking about hot! Now look, dawgs, what we need to do is form a couple of plans. Y'all following me? Any suggestions? Let's go. Fuck a plan. Let's just do it. Just hear me out, dawg. We form a couple of plans, all is well, man. We go get us some pussy, man. Every pimp in L.A. had a plan before he got him some. You know this, dawgs. We need to be up out in that hood, man, getting some tips. What if the plan doesn't work out? That's why we form a lot of them, man. Front and back-- paper all day. Come on! Ways of getting pussy. Plan a. I got an idea. We go to Hollywood, right? We walk to sunset boulevard. Find us some prostitutes. Pay for some stanky pussy, man! You crazy, man? Oh, suppose though, we go up on fox hills mall, man. Forever 21 having a gang of hos up in there. That's a bad idea. Look, those girls ain't thinking about no dick. They got clothes on their mind. Besides, they all high maintenance. Yeah, you right, dawg. I got it. What if we go on the Internet and go into one of those chat rooms and find a few bitches? Yeah. I met some fine hos online before. I don't got a computer. I mean, I'm getting one, but... Not 'til Christmas. You're stupid, man. We need one now. Scratch that. Yo, I got it. I got it, man. I'm coming home from the store, right? I'm just walking down the street. And this porno director comes up to me, man, tells me how he wants me to be in a porno, offers me 5 gs just to fuck some bitch in front of a camera. I told him I have to think about it. You know what I'm saying, but... I ain't hollered at him since, you know? Still got his number? Oh, shit... Hell, yeah! Write that shit down. Porno...nice, tight. Plan b. Plan b? I got it. The strip joint. Some fine-ass hos in there, boy! Yeah, the strip joint! Plan c. How many fucking plans we gonna have? Just chill out, man. One more. Let's go. I got it. My cousin Regina. She be having barbecues over at her house all the time. Then she be inviting her female friends over, too. Which I think is fucked up. She never invites me. I got a problem with that. I'm going to let her know what's crackin'. When is she having another barbecue, dawg? I'm going to have to bust some new ecko gear. Smash on them hos. I'll find out. I gotta find her hook-up. Yeah...b-b-q. All right, gentlemen, what we have here is a mission to complete. This is mission impossible. If we choose for the pussy to be de-virginized, that's on us. The pussy shall self-destruct in-- beep beep--48 hours. Yo, so, uh... What do we do now? Why don't you call that porno director up? Show the way! Hey, what's up. Is this Mike capello? Hey, what's up, dawg? This is Trey Williams. Uh, Trey Williams. We met sometime last month outside that little mini-mart. Y'all still don't remember me? How about this-- I'm the brother with the bad breath. Yeah, that's me, that's me, yeah, ok. Yeah, anyways, man, what I was wondering was if you're still filming those porno movies. Yeah, huh? Yeah, I'd be down to get paid to get laid. Yeah, for sure, for sure. What was that? Really? What was that title again? Oh, shit! That's a sick title, man. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'll be your star. No doubt, man. Hey, but actually, I was kind of wondering if I could get some of my friends to come down with me, maybe co-star with me with some of your fine actresses. Uh-huh. All right, cool, cool, man. That sounds good. So, let's see- how do we go about, uh, getting started with this? Uh-huh. Ok. Ok, then, man. Sounds good. All right, I'll see you then. All right, later. What did he say? Man, he said tomorrow morning we roll up to his place and get started. Damn, that's tight! And that's just the beginning of it, man. We each get a copy of the porno, they're going to feed us, and we each get 2 gs apiece just to fuck some fine-ass porno bitch on camera, man. It is on! Fellas, we got things to do, places to go, women to see. Yo, fellas, I think it's time to put plan a into action. You know what I'm saying? There's no turning back now. What's up, fellas? Hey, what's going on? We're having a private lingerie party later. Must be there. It'll be fun. Damn! One more time again. One time again. Hey, what's up, Derek? Yo, I mean crazy loc. What's up, man? What's up, losers? We was wondering-- you want to get some of this? Y'all got your allowance? Come on and get some. We need your help, dawg. We're trying to get some pussy. We need a ride. Trey got some freaky shit lined up. Y'all got some money? Nobody rides in my shit for free. We got you, crazy loc. Yo, here's a dubb. Hey, I got to pick something up before I take y'all. Cool. [Alarm chirps] Open the door, man. You two are sitting in the back seat. All right, listen up. I'm about to handle my business, all right? None of y'all bitches move 'til I get back. Got it? This fool is crazy, man. We're going to die virgins. I don't want to die no virgin. Ain't he on probation, man? Why's he fucking around? We didn't need a ride this bad, Trey! My ass would have walked like a Hebrew slave. Oh, shit, man. Is today the 1st? He's got to break his baby mama alize off some cheese, man. What? He do this once a month. He'll be out. He'll be out. Fuck that, man. This was your idea. Why don't you make a bigger scene, huh? Why don't you make a bigger scene? What's up? Got y'all some extra cash. Trey: That's what I'm talking about! I don't know shit. Trey, here's a little money from the robbin' spree. Don't tell anybody or I'll beat your asses. Oh, hell no. Damn! This brother's living large! He is pimping it! Listen, men. Y'all remember we's proper gentlemen, ok? Who's about to get laid. Hey, Trey, what's going on, man? How y'all doing? Find your way ok? I remember, you told me where you live before. Right, right, right. This is Perry, this is Chuck, man. We all came up together. All right, I'll get y'all in the back so you can meet the lead actress and we'll get you... Fluffed up.

Look, why don't you guys go in the back, get undressed, be ready in like 10 minutes. I'm going to do a run-through with anaconda, all right? What are we supposed to wear?
