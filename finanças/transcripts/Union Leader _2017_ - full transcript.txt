(Birds Chirping) - You must have added the chemical, right? - Yes. I have. Check the ones at the bottom. - Have you taken the readings? - What? - Have you taken the readings? - The readings are correct, boss. I have told you so many times that I'm not the boss. The boss is sitting downstairs. Jai. Okay, boss. Boss again? You will not change. That's four. - Jai. Is that okay? - Correct. Okay listen. Check this vessel as well. Everything's alright. You've made me an expert in six months, boss. He keeps calling me boss. 4...We have to get more from downstairs as well. (Gas Leaked Sound) Do the switch off. That line is leaking. The entire line is leaking. - What happened? - We'll have to change this line. Line? There is a need to change this entire plant. Apply some ice on it. Anand sir. Excuse me. Apply ice. - Sir. Anand sir. - Okay. I'll talk to him. - There's a line leaking over there. - What's the status of the paper? - I want it right now. - Sir, this is dangerous. Digant got injured. Okay. Okay. Will be repaired in the next shift. Take the samples first. - It is more important to send it. - Sir, but the line... It's a minor injury. He'll be fine. Okay? - So folks, how was the day today? - Alright as usual. Digant, why are you applying ice? The dryer got me real good. - Is it? - The steam line had leaked. I had a narrow escape. This plant is very dangerous. This has become a daily thing. Come. Let's go talk outside. (Coughing) Manoj. Come here. I want to talk to you. - Come with us. - I'm busy now. I have a meeting to attend. - So go later. - I said I'll come and talk later. Bosses must be waiting. So tell them that a worker had a narrow escape just now. Meagre salary and major dangers. Come on. Now there is no point in keeping quiet. The situation is going from bad to worse. If this continues all the workers would end up either at the hospital.. ..or in the graveyard one day. You also get your scooter fixed. It could break down any time. And you consult a doctor. I have told you so many times. You just don't listen. What's the point? He'll diagnose the disease and charge a hefty fees. Then die coughing. Because the union just doesn't care about us. And Manoj. No one knows what he does at these meetings? What could we have done? Everyone was voting for Manoj. So we did too. We'll vote for you too if you contest. So who is being given the vote? The one who is able to work for all of us. - I do. - Yes. You've done a lot of work. - It's for everyone to see. - What happened? You're getting everything. Salary on time. Just salary. People are getting sick. People are dying of cancer. Can't you see all this? Look at him. He is in need of treatment badly. Cancer? Who died of cancer? - Three? - I see. Three have died of cancer. And no one knows. Great. You can be a leader for sure. What did you say? You think this is a joke. The death of workers is a joke to you. Is this a game? Why are you biting the hands that feed you? The worker didn't die of cancer. But due to excessive smoking. If you don't believe then read the blood report. Not all workers smoke. And the other worker has asthma. Every third person has ulcer. Many have gaping holes in their noses. Can't you see this? Do you want everyone dead? If you have so many problem then find another job. Why are you ruining their livelihood? If I had been in your place this situation would've never arose. Got it? I see. So replace me. Form your own union. And then fight for rights. It's easier said than done. You're left screaming but no one bothers. Got it? Be happy with what you're getting. Or you'll lose this as well. Tell him. Or he'll lose the job as well as... Why do you blabber so much? Can't you keep quiet? This is happening because we keep quiet. He thinks we are morons. What does he think? Only he can run the union. Jai, we won't spare him this time. We'll form our own union. Only then will he know his place. Union and stuff is not my cup of tea. - Someone will have to start. - Shall we? - Let's have food. - Jai. Jai. Boss. Listen to me. Mamma, give me another flatbread. There is no flatbread. Have rice. How are your studies going? - Papa is asking something. - Great. - Great. My foot. - Great means great. Have you gone mad? He is asking about studies. I'm talking about studies. It's going fine. I topped the previous exams. You won't get admission in medical because of that. - Harsh. - What? - Answer him. - I did. Study hard. Score good grades. Or I'll have to do labour work in a factory like you. Geeta. We've borrowed a loan for your studies so that your life gets made. How many other kids here study in an English medium school? - Tell me. - All the schools are the same. All they do is teach to memorize. Pass and get a job. Fit into the system. What's wrong in fitting into the system? No one teaches how to become a good person. How to live in harmony with everyone? I hate this society. - Never mind him. Here. - It's okay. What's wrong with him? Don't know. Ever since he has visited Gandhi's ashram he has been obsessed. Gandhi's ashram? Why does he go there? How would I know? You ask him. Our life is hell. Now his will be too. Eat. Remote. Why did you change? Are they teaching you all this at Gandhi's ashram? Answering back. Saying the right thing not answering back. (Crying) - Really? - Yes. What are you thinking? Nothing. Tell me. I'm thinking of starting the work of gear bearing in vehicles. We'll get some extra income. Start with your scooter. You also harass me. Uncle Raman is harassing me. He spoke of the rent in public today. Why don't you ask Digant? He also rides pillion with you on the scooter. He should share the petrol money. Right? He is like my little brother. I'll borrow money from someone. Not at all. We're also neck deep in debts. I've made a huge mistake by sending Harsh to an English medium school. I'll not let Harsh lack anything. (Rooster Crowing Sound) Jai, the condition of this place is also like your scooter. It could stop any time if not repaired. - What? The plant? - Your scooter. This time the repairing proved very costly. So you should've told us. We would also helped. You will have to from the next time. Got it? Or no free lift. - Who is saying no? - Jai. Prakash has passed out. Come fast. - What? - Yes. Over there. Come on. - Prakash. - Prakash. - Prakash. - Prakash. What happened? Prakash. The ambulance hasn't come. I've got an auto rickshaw. Come on. Pick him up. - Prakash. - Carry him. Come on. Prakash. Open your eyes. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Careful. Careful. Come. He has brought the rickshaw inside. Come on. Come with me. What's wrong with him? He has met the same fate as others. Inhaling the Chromium Sulphate has destroyed his lungs. So take him to the hospital. So why don't you help us? Does the company have any facility called emergency? - Come on. - Nonsense. - Come on. - Come on. What's the status on the rickshaw? It is here. Brother, thank you so much. God knows what might have happened if not for you. Why are you embarrassing me? It's all the Almighty's grace. How are you, Prakash? You guys talk. I'll get tea. I told you so many times to see a doctor. But you just don't listen. It was just cough. Little did I know... We'll know what the problem once the complete diagnosis is done. It's not going to be of any use. It's Rita ma'am's way of getting money out of me. I see. Let me also see how much money you have on you. Raise your hands. I'll take all the money today. Okay. Lie down straight. Don't move your hands. Uncle, check. If the money in your pocket is lesser. The money isn't less but it seems the blood is less. Jai, at this old age my family needs me and this is my condition. What will be of Kasi once I'm gone? Don't worry at all. And you bet. We'll have tea at your house very soon. Do you know? Ram Prakash too was coughing like this before dying. We didn't pay attention. But you guys pay attention. For the sake of your kids and wives. This is what I have been trying to explain since long. But no one is listening to me. All of you have become deaf. - Digant, let's go out. - Where? - Come on. - Jai. - Come on. - Listen to me. Why are you creating a scene? This is a hospital. - Try to understand. - I'm creating a scene. I'm creating a scene. And what the company is doing is nothing. - Go from here. Go. Come on. - Jai. Let's talk later. - We'll not keep quiet. We'll show the company its place. - Go. Got it? I'll show the company its place. You have helped us in a big way by saving Prakash's life. - Thanks. - That's my duty. Prakash is like my father. Indeed you're working very honestly. If you continue working in this vein our company.. ..will soon be Gujarat's top company. And by then God knows how any workers would die? - What? - Yes. This company is earning profits at the cost of people's lives. - What rubbish. - Ignore him. He is crazy. He gets such attacks from time to time. Okay. The company will fix this as well. Cure your greed first. All we need is safety and health. Why are you barking? Do you realise who you're talking to? He is this company's owner. - Boss. - So? Are we any lesser? The plant is working because of us. Listen. If the situation doesn't improve soon we'll form a new union. And if you still don't do anything we'll go to the labour ministry.. ..and bring you on the right track. Darn it. Last year, two of our co-workers Ram Prakash and Harish died of cancer. Rizwan too. Everyone died of Chromium Sulphate inhalation. Yes. Everyone knows that these deaths weren't natural. But no one speaks out. And the one who should is licking the boss's boots. Smart Alec, why are you instigating everyone? Friends, we know that we are in talks with the management about the salary. We've been hearing this since long. Do talks fill our stomachs? Do talks fill our stomachs? Look, have some patience. Company is setting up a new plant in Vapi. - As soon as the plant is set up... - Enough. Keep quiet. We've heard enough. Keep quiet. Friend, there is no point in listening to him. Now is the time for a new union, for a new union leader. I propose Jai Goel's name for the new union leader. Jai. Yes. Jai is the right choice. (Crowd Applauding) Friends, I understood your feelings very well. But I'm requesting all of you with folded hands. I'm not worthy of this. (Bike Engine Sound) See you tomorrow. Papa, hats off. You're still using the scooter that's older than me. Where are you going so late? For some work of the ashram. Ashram? You have exams. You should be studying. Trust me. I'll not disappoint you. Papa, you're making me a doctor so that I serve everyone, isn't it? This is what they teach me at the ashram. But in a slightly different way. Is it? How is that? As in all of us should be healthy. No one should need a doctor. A good doctor doesn't judge the symptoms but roots out the disease. I don't understand things that you say. Papa, for example. You clean the scooter's corroborator twice a week. Why? Because you use adulterated petrol as it is cheap. This is why your gasket too conks out repeatedly. But you don't change the engine oil. And eventually the engine fails. You're treating the symptoms of the disease and not rooting it out. Yes. Go. Go. This wouldn't have happened if you had maintained it since the start. - Go. Go. - Okay. Bye. Rest. Have proper sleep. And this is very important for your health. Is it something serious? No. No. It's not a serious problem. Come to me if you cough a lot or if you have trouble breathing. Got it? And... ..keep taking this medicine till the urine clears up. Stop. Stop. The road is closed. Go by the back road. My friend lives here. I have to go there. Ask the friend to come here. Or wait. - What...What has happened here? - A murder. Murder? Whose? How would I know? I don't carry the deceased's I-card, do I? Get back. Get back. He is not answering the call. The number you're trying to reach is currently switched off. Sir, my friend is not picking up the phone. But you can't go from here. Give me your friend's name and flat number. His name is Digant. And flat number is 219. 219? The murder has happened there. You stay here. I'll go call sir. How long have you known Digant? For three years. How do you know him? We were co-workers. And we had become friends. (Crying) Did he have enemies? Don't know. I don't know. Without marriage. Without kids. He had wretched luck. - He has been murdered. - Murder? Whose murder? One of my friends. You don't know. - Sorry. - I don't know. - I'm going out. - So late? I'm feeling kind of uneasy. What's done is done. We can't change it, can we? But I can set straight what's wrong, right? This is what Diga was trying to do. This is why he was murdered. Don't get into this mess. He was like my little brother. He was fighting for our rights. We can't just sit at home quietly, right? There are other workers too at the plant. To do all this. Don't bring the politics there home. Are you aware of the problems the workers are having? They have been working for all these years. Look at the salaries? How can they sustain themselves? Whatever the case. We are living peacefully, right? We don't need any more problems. Listen to me. 'I'm creating a scene. And what the company is doing is nothing.' '- Go from here. Go. Come on. - Jai.' 'Let's talk later.' '- We'll not keep quiet. We'll show the company its place. - Go.' 'Got it? I'll show the company its place.' (Birds Chirping) (Knock On Door) Let me see. I had told you. We'll have tea at home. - How are you? - I'm fine. Everyone's asking about you. I would've come tomorrow if I could. But this darned disease. No salary. And the cost of medicines to add to it. Let me know if you need anything. You're already doing so much. Not even my own would've done so much. What are you saying? We are family. The doctor has said that he doesn't have much time. He has cancer. The doctor has given up. (Crying) Gentlemen, Digant was like my child. I taught him work with these very hands. He was so hardworking. He would do his work. And he would also lend others a hand. And he used to fight for his rights. And this is what I liked about him the most. (Coughing) Hold him. Hold him. Prakash was trying to say that.. ..Digant was a very good man. He wished well for all of us. He would always say. These bosses need us. We don't need them. And this is why perhaps...he lost his life. Look at Prakash. His condition is so bad. And same is the condition of many of our co-workers. What was his dream? Now who is going to fulfil his dream? What you just say is the sample of industry. It symbolises self-reliance and the dignity of labour. Gandhi was never against capitalism. According to him the labourers get the product ready. And increase the capital. That's why the boss should take care of the workers as a trustee. And hence the workers become co sharers with.. ..capitalism instead of remaining a slave. That's why the boss looks after the workers' welfare. So take a look around. And we'll continue the tour after a short break. Papa, you? What are you doing? Had I been in your place I would've been buried in my books. Just as you can't work all the time I too can't study all the time. I like coming here. You won't gain anything from here. Do you understand status quo? It means maintaining the current situation. Not bringing any change in it. Gandhi would say that we'll perish if we don't change. That's why I believe in change and not in status quo. - Now may I go? - Go. - Sir. - Yes. What is it? I want to meet Mr. Parmar. Go straight and turn right. - Mr. Parmar. - That's me. Tell me. I want to talk to you. It's urgent. I need just two minutes. Come tomorrow. I'm already late today. - Sir, have you heard of Apollo chemicals. - Come tomorrow. We manufacture Chromium Sulphate. I'm the plant operator there. The condition of the plant is very bad. The workers are suffering from all kinds of diseases. And the bosses are just not bothered about it. Diseases? What diseases? Sir, difficulty in breathing. Holes in the noses. Ulcer. Cancer. Come with me. Look, for the safety of the workers.. ..for the protection of their rights...Sit. Government has made some strict rules. And it's the responsibility of every company to comply with the rules. And then Chromium Sulphate is produced at your plant. At a plant like that, every worker must get a health check every two years. I've been working in this company for the past 10 years. There hasn't been a medical check-up even once. Look, I've been transferred here from Mumbai just recently. So I don't have much info about your plant. But as you're describing it's clear that.. ..your company is not treating the workers well. What does your union leader do? It's his responsibility. I wonder what he is doing. - We are really fed up. - Do this. Give me your name, address and contact number. We'll conduct an inquiry. Manoj. Manoj. I have spoken to the labour inspector. He says that the workers should get a health check every two years. Jai, why are you getting involved in these things? It's the question of the workers' health. I want you to talk to Ketul sir regarding this. Okay. I will. I said I will. Go. Okay, you've been working here since before me. Do you remember? Has there ever been a health check-up? Health check-up? What's that? I've never heard of it. When we came here 12 years ago our body was examined. Remember? Yes. The doctors in the white clothes. With the pretty nurse. She injected. It was painful. My hand was hurting for two days. They pressed my hand and left. But the check-up never happened again. What is Manoj saying? What's he going to say? The same. He is evading it. All are frauds. And I don't think anything's going to happen. (Knock On Door) So late at night? Let me see. (Door Opens) - Raman, you? - Have I come at the wrong time? You should've called me. I would've come over. - Would you like some tea? - No. I had it at Joshi's place. I thought of collecting the rent on the way. It' been two months. I'm in need of money this time. Uncle, this time I'll get salary a little late. I'll give you as soon as I get it. Give me one month's rent. Pay the other month's later. Now? There is no money in the house right now. I'll withdraw from the bank and give you tomorrow. Okay. I'll wait. But mind you. I'm in need of money this time. He owns ten houses. Still he is in need of money. Did you talk to them about a raise? - You don't get a raise just like that. - Why? You do the most work in the factory. Will you just keep quiet? Please. It's okay. I'll sell the scooter. Sell it. There isn't anything else to sell. So now how are you going to travel now? I'll figure something out later. Don't bother yourself. My bike is lying gathering dust. You use it. Return it when I resume work. Do think about what Digant said once. You're saying this? There is no other choice. Digant was emotional but he wasn't mature. You're mature. Let me speak to Manoj and Ketul sir once at length. It won't help. He wouldn't want Manoj to step down. Ketul has bought him. How do you know? Go have tea at his house once. You'll understand everything. (Bike Engine Sound) There are better workers at the plant than me. That's not the case. You've trained everyone. You're senior. And everyone listens to you. So we want you to be our new leader. But Bala. Prakash. I know nothing about the union. Tell me something. Did you know everything when you came to this plant? He's right. Think about it. It's better to die fighting than to die of disease. - Jai. - Yes, Anand sir. Ketul sir wants to see you. - Tell him I'll come in a bit. - Do that later. He is waiting. (Phone Ringing) Come, Jai. Welcome. We are sorry about what has transpired in the past two months. You know. Digant's death has hit our plant badly. We are sorry about Prakash's ailment. During this time, the honesty and earnestness with which you've worked. Thank you so much. You have appreciated my work. It would've been better if you give me a raise too accordingly. Actually I have been thinking about your promotion for the last few days. In today's times, it is rare to find an honest man like you. And Anand told me that the post of the supervisor is vacant. And once you become the supervisor your salary too will increase quite a bit. You also want this, right? But the union and stuff is not meant for an honest man like you. You should spend maximum time with your family. All of us want to spend time with our families. No one wants to get into the union and stuff. - You also don't want, right? - Yes. Absolutely. I knew. I knew you would accept our demands. You'll make the plant safe by installing new equipment. Then no one will suffer from cancer or disease. And nor will union form. Why are you talking rubbish? There is no better Chromium Sulphate plant than ours in India. And as far as safety and security is concerned.. ..we are following all the international rules and norms. And get this straight. I'm in talks with Manoj about the workers' salary. Manoj is not the union leader anymore. We're forming a new union. Now you'll have to talk to the new union. First of all, thank you for coming here. As all of us know we have formed a new union by the name Kamdar Union. And today we have gathered here to appoint its new leader. And all of us have decided that our new union leader will be Jai Gohil. (Crowd Applauding) So I request Jai Gohil to put forth his views. All of you must be knowing all about my scooter. (Laughing) I fill it with adulterated petrol as it is cheap. Then I have to clean the carburettor every second day. And then when even it doesn't work then I change the gasket, Prakash. Even then my scooter breaks down in the middle of the road. Do you know why? Because it's engine is faulty. I'm not treating the disease from its roots. I'm treating its symptoms. And Ketul too is doing the same to us. He is not fixing the plant. He keeps repairing the symptoms. And what is happening. The disease is growing to be fatal. We are getting sick. We are dying. How long do we tolerate? Are we supposed to keep dying like this? Now the time has come to cure this disease from its root. (Crowd Applauding) So we'll need your co-operation to form this new union. Show us with a raise of hands who is with us. Now we have two unions in the plant. And we have to vote for one between them. The one who wins between Jai and Manoj will be our union leader. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. (Crowd Applauding) So you're back after solving everyone's problems. - What have I done? - Don't play innocent. You bring others' problems home. Then you ask what I have done. (Dishes Clattering) What are you talking about? What have I done? At least don't play innocent before me. Aunt Kashi has told me everything. What's wrong with you? Why are you getting upset? All this is happening for our own good. So that we meet the same fate as Digant. Is there no one else in the plant? You're messing with the goons. One needs to fight for his rights. You have to fight for your rights. I thought you were looking for a job somewhere. The situation is the same everywhere. It's better you fight with people you know rather than with unknown. And what if they fire you from the job? How are we you going to survive? - I'll have to take this risk. - What? I'll have to take this risk. How long do we tolerate everything meekly? Not anymore. Everyone is with us. They'll have to listen to us. Friends, keep calm. The results of the union elections are as follows. The leader of Apollo labour union Manoj Pandey has got 16 votes in total. And the leader of Kamdar Union Jai Gohil has got 213 votes. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. I declare Kamdar union the winner in this election. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. (Crowd Applauding) Friends, I assure all of you that I'll not let your trust break. I'll put forth things of your interest very soon. Number one. All we workers should get medical insurance. Number two. We haven't got a raise in all these years. We deserve a raise. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. And I'll meet the labour inspector today itself.. ..and put forward these things to him. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. - Kamdar. - Union. Mr. Sumani, the safety standards are very poor in your plant. You need to repair air filtration and electrical wiring immediately. And you have to get the health check up all the workers.. ..in your workers done in the next 30 days. And I give you 30 days for the comments I have made here. 30 days. Or you'll have to shut down the plant. Papa, are you happy now? I've scored 98% in the finals. - I'm very happy. - Okay. On that note have some sweets. - You also have it. - No. I'll feed you. - Geeta, have it. - Okay listen. Did you talk to them about reducing the fees? It will cost 5-6 lakhs at the least. People pay even 50-60 lakhs for donation seats. But for us, even 5 lakhs is huge. We don't have to pay the entire amount at once. - 5 lakhs in 4 years, right? - Yes. For us 5-6 lakhs is huge. How are we going to arrange? Have trust in God. We will manage. Do you remember how happy we were before marriage? He wasn't even born. And we were dreaming of making him a doctor. And today when we are getting the chance to make him a doctor.. ..then you're getting upset. I'm not upset. I'm just worried about the money. I'm glad you didn't marry that man. Which man? The one who came to meet you for marriage before we eloped. Don't talk rubbish. - That man's story. - Papa, what man? Which story? - Ask her. - Play along. He's playing. - No. Now I want to know. - He wants to know. Tell him. Tell me. Please. Why do you bring up the past? Tell him. He wants to hear. Tell him. Tell me please. Nothing. I was just 16 or 17 then. And my parents have found out that I was going around with him. So they wanted to get me married. So this guy came to meet me. Fat guy. That was it. I was really unwell that day. My stomach has aching badly. I was suffering from gas trouble. So I thought God knows when he is going to stop. He was asking so many questions. Like this. Which food do you like? Which is your favourite movie? (Laughing) I mean one disgusting question after the other. I just wanted him to stop his questions. And my stomach was aching so badly. I couldn't bear it. So I shifted a little and I farted. (Laughing) - Then. - I thought I had gotten away with it. After a while it started to stink so badly. The boy was looking here and there. I was avoiding eye contact. It was really bad. - Even a cow farts better than this. - He took off. He took off and never came back. And then I got married to him. Happy? Exactly. That's why I wonder.. ..why the house stinks so much when I return from school. (Laughing) - Rubbish. - Sorry. What do you want? What's the status on the raw material? The raw material isn't arriving. And we have just two sacks left. - Just two sacks? - Yes. - What's going on? - What? There is no raw material. There is no production happening. Or maintenance. Machines are not being repaired. I know nothing about this. Talk to Ketul sir. The workers' health check-up. What the status on it? - Is it going to happen? - Like I said. I know nothing about this. How is he going to reach by morning? He has left just now at 8 pm. Yes. Yes. Okay. And this will be our last consignment. Yes. Alright. - We had made a deal. - Deal? What deal? What the labour inspector... Okay. Okay. You're talking about the labour inspection. I can't do anything. I don't have money.. ..and I can't afford your useless demands. In that case the plant will shut down. Let it get shut down. You're responsible for this. You. You compelled me. Go ahead. Form another union. After today neither do you guys have work nor do I. I will shut down the plant in two days. Until when? For good. I've ruined everyone's lives. - It's not your fault. - It is. It is my fault. You gave Ketul a chance to change. But he went back to his old ways again. How? He was once put under pressure like this before you joined. He shut down the plant in order to evade the legal orders. But... The workers scattered after a few months. So he hired them back and started the plant. This is how you got the job. But isn't shutting down the plant disadvantageous to him? No. It's advantageous to him. He'll save on billions that he would have to spend to fulfil our demands. The officials can be bought for 4-5 lakhs. Then he'll also save on the money required to repair the plant. This is cheaper deal for him. What will be of us till the plant restarts? How are we going to survive? Where had you been till so late? What happened? The plant is shutting down. What? The plant is shutting down, Geeta. I knew this was going to happen. That is why I was stopping you. Good luck with your politics now. You just pay heed to me. What are we going to do now? Do as you please. Do you remember? I had promised you before marriage. I don't want to hear anything. That I'll give you a good life. I never could. You ran the house with a meagre salary without complaining. Nothing has changed even after so many years. The situation went from bad to worse. I wanted to fix everything, Geeta. (Crying) I wanted to fix everything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Geeta. I'm sorry. Stop. Stop crying. Enough. Who is it so late? Hello. (Birds Chirping) I find it very hard to spend my days. Why don't you guys move in here? Aunt, you'll also get bothered along with us. There is nothing left in my life. The one who should have been my companion is gone. (Crying) Aunt Kashi, we are with you. Always. You're the only family I have. Papa, moving in to someone else's house feels a little strange. It is not someone else's house. It is also our house. Sir, please get us justice. Everyone's salary for months is pending. People are sick. No one has work. Or money. Moreover he has shut down the plant fearing the medical check-up. According to the records we have.. ..the medical check-up of the workers at Apollo chemicals happens regularly. Sir, this report is false. Ketul Somani has submitted the wrong report. We can't take any action against any company without any proof. If what you're saying is true then do this. File a complaint against the company in writing. List all the problems. And get the workers' signatures on it. If the complaint turns out to be right.. ..then we'll surely take action against the company. (Knock On Door) Iqbal, the... I have lost my livelihood and bread and butter thanks to your union stuff. Try to understand. The government will take action only if we stick together. And the new labour inspector Parmar sir is helping us. Excuse me. (Door Closes) I have told him so many times to consult a good doctor. I can't bear to see his condition. Talk to him once. Take him to some good doctor. Go. What are you thinking? Nothing. What are you thinking, Harsh? I was thinking of getting admission in BSC and not in medical. What rubbish. It will be less costly. Lots of people pursue BSC. It is quite a good career option. I...I spent all that money on your school and tuition so that you pursue BSC. Why did you lie to me? Lie. You said you were going to get a raise. And you'll be able to bear the expense of the medical stream. I will manage it. Your fees for medical will be arranged. Right now my fees for medical is not important. You need good treatment. What's wrong with me? Yes? You hide your problems so easily. I'm just a kid. I understand nothing. That's not the case. It won't matter if become a doctor or don't. But it does matter to us if you're unhealthy. No. I will not pursue MBBS. After all the hard work for all these years.. ..you're breaking my dream so easily. Papa. I...I didn't mean to say that. For me, nothing is more than you in this world. You don't believe me, isn't it? Then tell me. What can I do to prove it? Get admission in the medical stream. - Any progress? - No. Only 12 have signed. But I explained to everyone. But no one's ready to listen. It's okay. No one's ready to understand. Everyone's dumb. Actually everyone is scared. It will take time. But everyone will relent. Well, did you speak to Vimla? - Actually I had an upset tummy this morning... - It means you haven't. Okay. Let's talk to Vimla. What's the point in doing all this now? He died of cancer. Now he won't come back, will he? It was our bad luck. Don't curse your luck. We want to prove that he lost his life because of the plant. You...Give. Sign this. The company gave me 50000 on his death. What if it ask me to return? They can't ask you to return. 50,000 is a really meagre sum. You'll get even more. Yes. But I don't understand... I don't want to get into the legal hassles. This won't be a court case. - How many people have signed? - 12. 12 have already. Sign it. Everything's going to be alright. I'm a lone woman. Don't get me into any legal hassle. No. Everything's going to be alright. Sign it. I understand your problem. My situation too is like yours. If I knew that these people are going to shut down the plant.. ..then I would've never spoken about health and safety. Even if Prakash dies of cancer. And I die of urinating blood. And you die of chromium dust inhalation. Dying doesn't make any difference to us. Losing the job does. Satish Parmar is a good labour inspector. He wants to help us. He has said that if we sign this petition.. ..then the government will take action against Apollo chemicals. They'll have to start the plant again. They'll have to hire us. With our demands at that. Now you guys decide. Do you wish to die by putting up a fight? Or die of suffering. (Crowd Applauding) (Phone Ringing) (Glass Bottle Break) You have become the union leader. Darn you. Who the hell is it? Here. You're going to be he union leader. Do you want me to shoot you down? I'll fire so many bullets in our backside.. ..that you'll never able to go to the toilet again. Got it? Sir, someone called Jai Gohil has come to see you. Do this. Tell him that I'm out of town for a few days. Sir is out of town. Come later. - Have you fixed it? - Yes, Rita madam? But the oil is leaking slightly. And there is slight suspension problem. Is it? I'll have to dismantle the entire car. No. Check it next time. I'll not be able to afford it at once. I've fixed the brakes. Come. Let's have a test drive. The brake is not making any noise, right? Get the engine oil leakage repaired quickly. Or the car could conk out. How much would that cost? Around 30000-40000. I'll have to dismantle the entire car. You work with Prakash uncle at the plant, right? Still you'll charge me so much. Okay. Pay only for the parts. - I'll manage the rest. - Thank you. Just pull up. Thank you. Bala. Where are you going? We have to meet certain people? Did you talk to Parmar sir? He is not picking up my call. Looks like he too has been bought. All of them are fooling us. We'll have to do something soon. Everyone's cursing us. Okay. I'll go to his office again. - Let me see what he says. - Okay. Is everything alright? I ran tests on all the workers. They have been treated very badly. You're the first person to say so. Or people think we are crazy. Ketul and my clinic's owner are very good friends. And that's why we are often told to show the.. ..workers' blood reports to be normal. And we have to do it out of fear of losing our jobs. Prakash's... Every worker who comes from the plant has the chromium problem. There was a lot of chromium in uncle's blood as well.. ..which we had to show as normal in the report. Darn it. Can you give me the real reports? You'll do me a huge favour. I can try. But my name shouldn't figure anywhere. Don't worry at all. I won't tell anyone. Sir. Parmar sir. Sir. I've been doing the rounds for days now. I guess you were out of town. You said you need all the worker's signs on this application. Everyone has signed. Come some other time. I'm busy today. Sir, take it. See. Everyone has signed. As you said. All the workers have signed. Look, the problem is that such cases are time consuming. How much longer is it going to take? Years. There are thousands of cases pending. I suggest you meet Ketul Somani and arrive at a compromise. That will be in everyone's interest. We tried so many times. But what happened? Hence we are complaining. The action will not be taken so soon. It will take a lot of time. No one's going to touch the file. What are you going to do till then? Jai, why are you wasting time? Yours and mine. I have a meeting to attend. This...What do I do with this? I'll keep it. But nothing's going to happen anytime soon. What will be of us? As I told you. Compromise is the only option. Compromise. What will be of Geeta? She'll not be able to bear it. Harsh has worked really hard. (Crying) He wants to be a doctor, Lord. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't... Don't... I'm sorry. You said the blood will stop. But still... It's okay. Does it burn while urinating? It is intense. Sometimes it takes longer for the medicines to work. - It's a kidney problem. - Is it cancer? No. This is a simple kidney problem. Your lungs are clear. I've prescribe a different medicine. - Perhaps this... - Perhaps? Perhaps? I've been urinating blood for the last 6 months. And you're saying perhaps. Do you even know what's wrong with me? If you have such a problem then go consult someone else. Here's the copy of the original blood reports. Keep them safely. It has uncle Prakash's report too. Come. Lift your hand. Roll it up. The doctor has prescribed lots of tests for you. Urine, sputum, blood. Give me your hand. Since when have you been urinating blood? - 6-7 months. - And you're coming now? It's okay. It's okay. Bend your hand. Hold it there. Two reports of the same blood report. One real and one fake. Now we can destroy Ketul's world. But how? The labour inspector too has been bought. Now we don't need that labour inspector. Let's do this. Let's go to the police station and file a murder complaint against Ketul. How? How is that going to help? Do we have money to fight the case? We need to find a lawyer who charges us after the case. It's difficult. It's difficult to find such a lawyer. And even if we find one Ketul will buy him too. I have a relative. Aunt's son. He has just completed LLB. And he is looked for a job. He might be able to help us. - Good idea. - But he doesn't have much experience. We need honesty and not experience. The original blood report of the diseased. I too have been urinating blood for a while now. The way you've been treated is really wrong. I will help you completely. We want justice. - Ketul should be in jail. Darn it. - I'll try my best. Come. Come, Jai. After a long time. Come. Let's have tea. You've become quite weak. Have you got your son admitted to the medical stream? - Will be done. - The study is very expensive. - It will cost at least 6-7 lakhs. - Come to the point. What have you come to say? I have an offer. You'll get 10 lakh rupees. Ketul sir wants to resolves the issues between us amicably. We'll reinstate all the workers. The plant will also restart. This is a really good opportunity. Your life will change. So what do you say? Now I'll discuss this with the one who is going to give me money. Fix a meeting with Ketul. So you're here. I've been waiting for you since long. Why? Do you have some other appointment? No. No. I have come here to meet you only. So let's get to the point. Here's the medical report of the workers who died while working in your plant. So? Everything it in is normal. It's normal? So what's this? This is not normal. Chromium is 15-20% higher. Do you understand what this means? Cancer. Disease. Death. Now shall we discuss what we have met for? So what are we doing? Look, I've not prepared it. Go meet the one who has prepared it. Tell him. Why are you wasting my time? Alright. Then I'll lodge an FIR against the doctor who has prepared this fake report. I've heard he is your friend. I came here thinking I'll withdraw the FIR. No issues. I'll file another FIR. Just a minute. How much do you want? Now you're talking business. So also accept that five innocent workers have lost their lives because of you. You want money, right? So why are you talking rubbish? Okay. We'll give you as much money as you want. How much do you want? 5 lakhs for one death. 25 lakhs in total for 5 deaths. Done. Give him the money. Do you understand status quo? Status quo means you'll perish if you don't change. The entire world has changed. But you haven't changed, Ketul. We tried so hard to change you. But you're like the rigid fool.. ..who just doesn't want to come out of the status quo. What nonsense. 25 lakhs in total for 5 deaths. Done. Give him the money. Your game is over, Ketul. Manoj, listen to me. It's an emergency. Jai has cheated us. Find him. Darn it. Have you gone crazy? You are acting very smart. Talk. Talk now. Talk now. Run. Run. Call the ambulance. Quick. Hello. I'm Dr. Joshi. You seem better than before. The stabbing has damaged your left kidney quite a bit. Now you'll have to be here for a few days. And we had run some additional tests.. ..which have shown that there is cancer in your kidney. Were you aware of it? Don't worry. Cancer is in the first stage. It can be cured. You'll be absolutely fine. Take care. Taking into consideration all the proofs produced.. ..the court has arrived at the decision that Ketul Somani.. ..and Anand Dixit purposely gave rise to circumstances.. ..which cost five workers their lives. Along with that they are also found guilty of.. ..cheating, bribery and tampering with legal and medical documents. And the court orders the police to investigate their roles.. ..in Digant Patil's murder and the attempt to murder on Jai Gohil. Manoj Pandey who carried out Digant Patil's murder.. ..and attempt to murder on Jai Gohil.. ..be hereby arrested as soon as possible. And the court orders Ketul Somani to sell the plant and company. The first part of the money from it be hereby.. ..used for the treatment of the needy workers of the plant. The second part be given to the families of the deceased. And the third and final part be divided among all the workers.. ..on the basis of their positions in the company. This court orders the new owner to reinstate all the workers. And to run the company under statutory act 1948. In the future complying with the labour laws.. ..proper attention be paid to the worker's safety and facilities.. ..so that such tragic events don't happen again. (Crowd Applauding) - Very good. - Great job. What I was saying is that sign the papers only after you check the points. Jai, someone has come to see you. - Who? - See for yourself. (Knock On Door) Hey Harsh. - You are here early morning. - Surprise. Surprise. Papa. New shirt. New cabin. You've become the boss. And you'll become a doctor. How are your studies going? - Great. - Great. - And Gandhi's ashram? - Good. Status quo. (Laughing) Synchro: Peterlin
