(very slow instrumental rock 'n' roll music) (laughing) (coughing, groaning) (coughing) (bin clattering) (car horn hooting) (car horn hooting) (brakes squealing) (woman yelling) - [Woman] You've gotta be kidding me! - [Cabbie] Every time I come to this neighborhood-- - It's my damn ride! (both yelling) (horns hooting) - I'm paying $9! - [Cabbie] $9. - $5, that's it! - Ma'am, it's nine bucks! (children yelling) (truck puffing) (men yelling) (ominous music) (singing) - My blue shirt clean, honey? What is it? Is it the baby? - No. I was just feeling sentimental about this picture. - [John] What did you ever see in this guy? - I was remembering how close we were in those days. To each other and to the Lord. - Yeah, those sure were the good old days. Always tired, always poor, always eating macaroni and cheese. You know, pregnant ladies sure have some weird ideas. - We were close to the Lord, and that made us close. We went to church and you helped in that clinic. - The blue shirt? Please? - John, you haven't gone to church with me in such a long time. - Sunday's my only day off. - If you just didn't play golf on Saturdays. - You know the situation. Gotta relax sometime. 'Sides, the contacts I make at the club are good for my career. - I know. - I gave enough when we were young. What more do you expect? - For God so loved the world, that He gave His one and only son. That whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. We were going to use our skills to bring souls to him! Now we aren't even going to church. (doorbell rings) - It's Bob. I've gotta go. We'll, we'll talk when I get back, okay? - John. - Not now, Penny. - When we enter the complex, we get a couple of guys in to do GYN and maybe fee, that way we make sure that one of our hands is washing someone else's. - You're being at family practice is good for all of us. - And me. I can send my really hairy problems to you specialists. - If it's hairy, it's in my field, kid. - Hey, look out John, Arnold'll try to rope you into one of his land deals. - Hey, don't listen to him, they're jealous because I made a killing last week on my G-side lab boys. - Oh by the way, who's your broker, John? - I don't have one. - Ooh, an innocent. - Now let me recommend somebody. - There goes John, down the primrose path. You better listen to Bob. - You listen to Bob, you lose your shirt. - Better your shirt than your money! - Ha ha. - [Kid] Look. - Alright, come on, you kids, leave! Beat it! Oh, this guy's dead! - Get his wallet, Dick, come on! - Get some out of him maybe. Hurry up! - Were you all that thirsty? (mumbles) (sirens blaring) Taken your last little drink. (police radio chattering in background) He just wanted a little drink, that's all. (elevator music playing) - Oh, I needed this. My score looked more like a bowling game today. - Yeah, I could tell that John is gonna make a real addition to the firm. I mean, he's smart enough to listen to me, and play good golf! - Uh oh. Don't turn around. - What. - Sam Edwards just walked in. I refused his request for contributions for that slum clinic. - He's a great doctor. But I heard he got religion or something. - Oh yeah, in a big way. Became a born-again Christian, and, stopped everything. Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't have any fun at anything. - He's hitting old Bickelman up for donation I'll bet. He hasn't got a prayer getting that clinic on Center street. - [Bob] Shows what religion can do to you if you catch it. - Order another round, I wanna disinfect myself in case it's catching. Don't let old Sam breathe on me. - Excuse me, gentleman. Is there a Dr John Lucas in your group? - I'm Dr Lucas. - Dr Lucas, there's an emergency phone call for you at the bar. - Now there's a disadvantage to being in general practice, my boy. - It's probably old Mrs Jordan. She keeps reading medical magazines, and gets a new emergency at least twice a week. Excuse me guys. - I think the kid is really gonna work out. - He's young and idealistic, but he'll learn fast. - Dr Lucas here. Yeah. What? - Gentlemen, I'm sorry to inform you, but Dr Lucas, his wife has had an accident. A serious accident. (ominous music) - [Penny] We were going to use our skills to bring souls to Him. - [John] Oh Penny, Penny. (somber music) - Here John, this'll help relax you, you need some sleep. (sips, sighs) (phone ringing) - Right, right. Yeah? Oh yeah, Bob. I guess, tomorrow is as good a time as any. Has it been six weeks? (sighs) I didn't realize. No no, I'll.... I'll come back tomorrow. Yeah. Bye. (sighs) (ominous music) Tomorrow. (door opening) - John. John! - Bob. What time is it? I'm supposed to go in today. I guess it's a little late? - Yeah, I'm beginning to think it's a little late, John. It's gonna be too late for anything if you can't pull yourself together. - Don't worry, I'm pulling myself together. I'm gonna be alright, I just, got to get it going, you know? You'll see, I'm fine, I'm just great. I'll get on top of it. (ominous music) (sad music) (shattering china) (ominous music) (dramatic music) - Well, my friend. Did somebody break into your car? - [John] Somebody stole most of my car. - Most of your car (laughs). Most of your car. (laughs) - I just hope, wait, I just hope the parts they stole were paid for. (laughing) - I tell ya, this calls for a drink. - Yes. You got one? - No. No, have you? - No, but, I'll buy you one. - Oh, good for you. - But nothing is open now. - Oh, buddy, don't you worry about that, I know exactly where we can go right around the corner. You come along with me and I'll... Back here, and we can just spend the rest of the night. (man choking) (dramatic music) - Call an ambulance, somebody, hurry. Call an ambulance! - Hey, cut it out! - Get an ambulance, this man is dying. - Hey, that's Jaime. Jaime! - Hurry up, or he'll be dead! (dramatic music) (radio chattering) - That should have had stitches. Now it's infected. - Ah, Miss Mary'll fix it. - At least let's clean it up. (coughing) - Should've gone in that ambulance too. Come on. - No ya don't! - He doesn't pay, doesn't get in. - Unless I'm mistaken this man has pneumonia. - Take him to the mission, I ain't no charity. - Just let us-- - I aint no charity! - Ah kid, Miss Mary'll fix him up at the mission. - Oh great. It wasn't a nightmare. - Somebody made a good haul last night. - Yeah. Anyone dumb enough to park that car on this street deserves what they got, is the ways I sees it. - Yeah. What street is this? - Center Street, baby. Center Street! (cabaret piano music) - What can I do for you? - I'm pretty sure this man has pneumonia with complications. Can you call an ambulance, or is there a clinic nearby? I'm a doctor. - We have no clinic, only Mary Henderson, a visiting nurse. I'll call an ambulance. - Thanks. - [Orange Shirt] Thank you. - How about you? Food? Oatmeal! Coffee. - Coffee, please. - [Tom] You bet, we got plenty of that. Hot, and black. - I need it. - There is Mary. - I thought someone was... I heard, there was gonna be a clinic down here. - Ah, you heard about Dr Sam trying to get one started. So far, no dough. No one interested. No money in it. You said you were a doctor. But you look more like a drunk to me, my friend. - I spent a whole morning in this cesspool called Center, and my car has been ripped off. And I found two old men near death and the only phone anyone would let me use is in this broken-down mission run by a born-again bouncer and a part-time nurse. Now you tell me! Under those circumstances, who wouldn't be drunk? - It seems to me, doctor, that you've been at it for some time. Have you looked in a mirror lately? (contemplative piano music) You look more like a drunk to me, my friend. (crockery clinking) (doorbell rings) - [John] Sam. - Dr Lucas. May I talk with you? I'm interrupting your dinner. - No. Interrupting my attempts to put nutrition into a body severely damaged by alcoholic poisoning. So far, the alcohol's winning. - Tom said you were feeling pretty seedy when he saw you, but, you still had some fire left. - He's wrong. What's left wouldn't roast a marshmallow. Coffee? - No thanks, I just came from a gallon of it, at a meeting. The meeting was about the problem on Center Street. - It's a problem. Surviving that street is a problem. - Yes. That's why we need your help. - My help? - [Sam] Tom Saw at the mission told me about your help with the old man with pneumonia. - Anyone woulda done it. - No John. Anyone would not have helped. The violence on that street is higher than any other in the city. People distrust the police and almost everyone else. And you know the dangers of alcoholism. The related factors of starvation, liver problems, susceptibility to virus, and all the rest. Overdoses of drugs with different names every month, but all coming under the name of poison, for the young. Despair and hopelessness grind these people more than their poverty and ignorance! The hurt children. The lack of care. Malnutrition. In the middle of an affluent country like ours. John, they need you. The Lord needs you to help them! - Look. Just leave. - Penny spoke to me the day before she died about you. - Penny? - She knew we were trying to get a clinic going, and she felt, that's what the Lord wanted for you, and for her. She said you'd talked about it, years ago. - Years ago. - See John, I tried to get one started on Center Street. I tried, but I failed. The people wouldn't come. I was, too alien to them. One kid called me a fat cat capitalist, looking for kicks. They wouldn't trust me. - Find someone else. I'm not the one. - They trusted you! Old Mike trusted you and let you take him to the mission. And Joe, another sad case, spoke well of you to Tom. You see, you've already started! - I was a drunk, talking to a drunk. That's all! - That's the point. - No! No, I have other plans. - Oh? - I... I had other plans. - You loved Penny. Won't you consider trying what she had in mind? At least, start a clinic until we can find somebody to replace you, just start one! - Penny is dead! She's dead! All the good works in the world aren't gonna make a bit of difference! - That's true. By grace alone, not by good work, will we be saved. But John! If you loved your wife. - If?! - If, you loved her. You must have loved her, her deep faith in her Creator, that was part of her. I'm hoping that you would use your gifts in her memory. Just until we can find someone else. I'll leave my number for you to call. Goodnight, John. I'll pray for you. And your decision. (gentle music) (ominous music) - [Sam] Penny talked to me the day before she died about you. She knew we were trying to get a clinic going. She said you'd both talked about it years ago. - [Penny] We were going to use our skills to bring souls to Him. Souls to Him. - [Sam] You know the dangers of alcoholism. The hurt children, the lack of care. - [Penny] We were close to the Lord and you helped in that clinic. - [Sam] Overdoses, drugs. - [Penny] We were going to use our skills to bring souls to Him. - [Sam] Poison. Use your gifts, they are many. They need you! - [Penny] For God so loved the world. - [Sam] She said you'd both talked about it, years ago. - [Penny] We were going to use our skills to bring souls to Him. That he gave His one and only son, His one and only son, only son. - Penny! (sobbing) (alarm buzzing) (peaceful music) - [Penny] Cristy fell in love with a doctor too, so I couldn't resist giving you this. Always serve your brothers in His name, John, for remember what the Lord said in Matthew 25:40. I tell you the truth. Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for Me. Love, Penny. (peaceful music) (banging) - Hiya, doc! Making an office for ya! - Hope you don't mind a mini-clinic, until things get going. Mary always used this room so the street people are used to coming here. Did Sam tell you not to bring drugs in your case or anything? - Oh, nothing more serious than aspirin. - Good. - But won't these instruments be a temptation? They can pawn them. - Sam is sending over an old safe. You will have to lock them up every night. - That figures. - Oh it's almost always full around here, so it shouldn't be too bad in that area. - Well I've already lost one bag, my diplomas, and a car to this street. Now, I figure I've paid my dues. Or is a mugging necessary for full initiation? Maybe I missed that. - Once they get to know your face, and who you are, you'll be safe. - I see. Don't mug a friend, is that it? - More like, don't put out one of the last lights or we'll all be in darkness. We really need you here, John. But I think you need us too. - That's the blind leading the blind. - Blessed is he who has regard for the weak, the Lord will deliver him in times of trouble. - Let's understand each other, Tom. I am here as a doctor, and only as a doctor. You can save your scripture for those who have to listen to you to get their soup. Now I treat anyone who comes to me. No ties, no religious blackmail. Understood? - Understood, John. But this is a mission. And I'm going on with the Lord's work even while you do yours. I'll use my Bible, just as you use your medical books. The Lord will not go away, John, just because you ignore Him. Do you understand? - Armed truce. - Separate peace. - Is this the real live doctor on Center Street? - May I present, Mary Henderson. - The line of kids hoping for bandaids is already forming outside, Doctor. - Shall we? (peaceful music) - Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man. Though for a good man, someone might possibly, dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love for us in this. While we were still sinners, Christ died, for us. Paul was talking about what we read earlier in Romans 3:23. All have sinned, fall short... - Those poor people have to pay for their meals. - What? - Tom makes them listen to that scripture, to pay for their handouts. - One, Tom would feed them whether they listened to the scripture or not. Two, they like to hear it. And three, the Bible gives hopeless men the promise of a future. - These people are failures. With no hope of anything except more failure. So what good does it do? - Read the Bible, John. Jeremiah 29:11, for instance, for I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you hope, and a future. - I can't believe in a plan that kills women and children. And I can't believe in a God that allows it to happen. - You know, like children we don't always why we are hurt in order to be made well. But you still give the kids the vaccinations that'll save their lives. - That's different. - Is it? (sighs) - I can't find a God in my life, or on this street. - You will seek Me and find Me, when you seek Me with all your heart. (gentle music) - Well He's gonna have to find me. Cos I'm not looking. - Dr Luke? Hi! Jaime! Remember? - Jaime! - I'm going to be your assistant! - Oh? - Oh, I can save you a peck of trouble, because nobody knows Center Street like little old Jaime. - Just take you to the (mumble) at the end of the line. 41 for you, sir. Hello. What are you doing? This is this little girl's. Here, you take this. And you go right down to the end of the line with the rest of them, down there. There you are, hello, hello. Dr John, says his name is Timmy! Maybe we wipe his face off you'll see what he looks like. (playful music) - Blend that lotion, Dr John, look at that, there's a little boy's face under all that. Get the towels, get him out of there. Here you are. Stand up. Gotcha. There we are. I'll get you toweled down. Your mother's never gonna know ya! There now! Y'all right? Oh my, I'll be upstairs. - Not so fast, Jaime, not so fast. - Oh no, oh no, not that, no. Stop, stop. - Just like Mom used to do, Jaime. - Yeah, now watch that hat. Oh, Timmy! You're a grand rascal, when I get my paws on you I'll give you the flat of my hand. (yelling) - Now come on, Jaime, you can't go in there! Come on. - Never seen a child (drowned out by laughter) Where did you put it all, huh? Put yourself over there. Sit down. There you are. - Anything? - Anything healthful. You too, Jaime, your blood needs some nutrients to fight off all that other stuff. - Pancakes? - Pancakes for the kid, please. - Eggs? - And eggs. - Sausage? Chocolate milkshake? - Anything that's there, Timmy, just anything that's there. (ominous music) - What about ripping off that new doc, man? - Don't do it, he lives with the mission, he doesn't have anything. He's no better than Tom to take from, no TV, no nothing. - Hey, we want that. - Nah, she hasn't got anything either, we tried her last week. What do you wanna do? - Let's just go. - Timmy. Father, we thank Thee for this food placed before us, and the man who has provided it. Amen. Say Amen, Timmy. - Amen. - You must always say Amen. - More coffee, preacher? - Oh thanks, Daisy, yes, a little bit. Thank you. - Jaime. Why'd she call you a preacher? - Oh. Well you see... I started out to be one, but, that was before I changed jobs. - It figures. - If I took home what I don't eat, I've got some brothers and sisters who can finish this off! - Sure. - How many are there now, Timmy? - Oh, six and a half. - Six and a half?! - I hope your dad has a good job, Timmy. - I've got no dad, Dr Luke. I never did. - You see, Jaime and his brothers and sisters live with their mother, alone. - We get welfare cos there's so many of us. But we don't get food like this. See, we get more money every time we have another kid. So... - I see. (bustling piano music) (background chatter) - No you don't. One per customer. Hello, how are you, there you are. Take care now, bye. (peaceful piano music) (dramatic music) - Hey! (yelling, grunting) (groaning) - Nononono, no. - Oof. - Gotta get him to a hospital, but he refuses to go. - You've said nothing was broken. - Nothing I can see or feel. - You know how he feels about hospitals. - I'm not equipped to treat him here. He may have internal injuries. - I heard. I thought maybe I could sit with him a while and relieve you. - Thanks, Mary. - I'll stay with Jaime. Why don't you walk Mary home? - [John] I can't believe you choose to live here. - [Mary] There are many to work in nice middle class hospitals and offices, but very few choose to come here. - [John] Most of these people, well, they've made their own problems. - No one is too far gone for His help, John. For I have said, O Lord, have mercy on me. Heal me, for I have sinned against You. - Some wounds just don't heal. - Healing takes place from the inside. Ask, and it will be given to you. - Ask the surgeon who took out my heart, to put it back again. - The Lord loves a broken and contrite heart, John. You haven't lost it. But you've let it harden. This is where I live. (peaceful music) Don't judge it by the outside. Some good people live here. - Mary, I... I appreciate your concern, I really do, but, you just don't understand. - Perhaps not. But you forget, that the God you are so angry with, sacrificed His only son for you. It was a choice He made, knowing the pain. You do not accept your pain. He accepted agony, for you. - Mary get home alright? - Yes. Lecturing me all the way. - I thought Mary might understand you best. - Maiden ladies with do-gooder tendencies would hardly be the type to understand me. - Mary didn't tell you about herself, then. - More like she told me off. - Mary was born on Center Street, just like Timmy. She had three little sisters that she raised up, because her mother was too drunk. She pushed them through school, and she worked her own way through nurse's training. - I can see that Mary is admirable, Tom. - During training, she met a young intern, and she fell in love. He was a strong Christian man, and they planned to come here and do what you've started. And then, one night, there was a knife fight, in the emergency room he was working in. Two drunks went after each other, and Pat, got in the middle of them, and tried to stop them. A lot of them, stopped Pat. So, Mary is here without Pat. But Mary and all of us here have been praying for a doctor. - You prayed, and you got me. That should show you how useful prayer is. - John. You think you are separate from Christ because you deny Him and the Father. But I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor anything else in all of Creation, can separate us from the love of God we find in Christ Jesus, our Lord. You accepted Him once, John. He is with you, even if you will not turn to see Him. (contemplative piano music) - I do deny You. I do deny You. (sobbing) (crickets singing) There you go, my friend. Sam, where did you come from? - Mary's out doing records, so I thought I'd assist. - Out you go. - Oh, I finally got your list filled in. Stuff's out in the car, and Tom's helpers are unloading it for you. - Good, we go through supplies quickly here. - John. I... I was wondering if I could come down and assist. Evenings, Saturdays. - You would be welcome. - Thanks. - By the way, have you found a replacement yet? - Replacement? - Yes. For me. I was going to get this started until you found someone else, remember? - Oh, yes, yes. No, I haven't found anyone yet. - Dr Luke, Dr Luke, Jaime, he's talking kind of funny. - Oh, I've gotta go. (dramatic music) - I'll call an ambulance. - Timmy, get Mary. And stay in the mission. (mumbles) - [Mary] Oh, Jaime. - For all have sinned, fall short of the glory of God. Three, 23, Romans. I just kept falling, and kept on falling. - Jaime, it doesn't matter now. - Oh, yes it does, John. For the wages of sin is death. And the gift of God is eternal life. In Jesus Christ our Lord. Three, six, 23, that's Romans, too. How clear the Scripture is, coming back to me. I want to confess my sins, before I go to Him. You understand that, don't you? First book of John. Book of John. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just, and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us, of all unrighteousness. I started out to be a preacher. Then I tried to drown out His voice in the bottle. I couldn't turn around. I was, so ashamed. I was too cowardly to live for Him. I thought He'd never forgive me. Then He, then He sent you, John. Oh I know, you were just an old drunk like me. But I saw you could turn around. You were a lamp He had placed in my window to light us all back again home. He sent you to help me find Him, John. - I... Yes, yes. He must have sent me here. - You are one of the Lord's lights, John. Yes you are. Isn't he, Mary? Even if he doesn't know it yet. - I think so, Jaime. - Yes, I saw that. You've got to help. Help save my friends. Timmy. Little Timmy. You've got to help Timmy to the Lord. He wouldn't listen to me, just a slobbering old drunk. But he'll listen to you. He's important to the Lord. Promise me you'll look after little Timmy. - I promise. - I pray, pray with me. Dear heavenly Father. I have sinned against You again and again. Heal me now. That I may come to You as I was on that first day when I accepted Your son as my savior. All those years ago. Oh, forgive me. Forgive me. Heal these children here. They think I don't know how much they're hurting. Oh I do, Lord. I have so much I want to tell You, how much they're hurting. And about all my friends on Center Street. Oh dear heavenly Father I'm so! - I guess you'll have to continue your conversation with the Lord in person, Jaime. You fill Him in on, all the problems here in Center. (sobs) (somber music) (John sighs) - I didn't think he was a sloppy old drunk, whatever he said, I didn't! - I know. - But you always in the doctor room all the time, and sometimes I get rough with him, you know, when he got too drunk. - I loved him too, Timmy. He knew how you felt. He loved you. Why do you let us suffer? No, that's unfair. I ran away from You but, I ran in a circle and, I had to face You again. I never realized how much suffering You did on that cross. Forgive me, heal me. Use me to help him. You miss Jaime, but he knew he was going home to his family. And he wasn't afraid. - But he didn't have no family. - But he did, he did. He had the biggest, richest, most loving family of all. The family of God. You can be in that family too. - Me? - Yeah kiddo. You. - The mind controlled by the spirit is life, and peace. Because the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. Those controlled by the sinful nature, cannot please God. You however, are controlled not by the sinful nature, but by the spirit. (knocking on door) - May I interrupt the doctor for a moment? - Bob Leelan! What are you doing at Center? - I heard you'd given up the bottle. True? - It's true. - You know, we still need a good GP. I talked with Jeff and Al, and we'd love to have you back. - Thanks for thinking of me, but no. I'm where I belong. - Here?! What can you do in a place like this? - Plenty. In fact, we need so much more help that, I'm putting you down for the ear, nose, and throat clinic one Saturday a month. Starting next Saturday. Of course you'll have to give up golf that day. And you never know what God might do for you in a place like this. (pleasant music) (kid yelling) - Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. Sir, said the servant, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room. Then the master told his servant, go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full. (pleasant music) You certainly keep a fellow busy, Lord. Thank you. Thanks for healing me by letting me heal others. And give my love to Penny, and our son. Tomorrow... Tomorrow... (rough music) - Take it from an old drunk himself. You need soup, not sauce. - I try, Dr Lucas. It's just-- - Give it to the Lord, Joe. We're not strong enough to kick the habit by ourselves, but, He's powerful enough to break any habit. - I ain't prayed since I was a baby, but, I give the idea some thought. Honest. - Good. C'mon, we'll walk Miss Mary home. (ominous music) - I know you want that supply made up tonight, I can stay. - No, it's late, you have an early morning. - I'll be glad to walk Miss Mary home. - Sure, Joe lives down by me, John, he can walk me home. Anyway, I'm safe on the street. - Okay, then you go straight home. - [Mary] Goodnight, Doctor. - Goodnight, Mary. - Goodnight, Doc. - Goodnight, Joe. (ominous music) - I know you don't keep drugs. But you got a prescription pad. And you can write me out what I need. - You don't need what you want. - Look, Doc! I'm dyin' man. So I don't care if I have to kill to get it! - Dead men, don't write. - Look I saw a program on TV, it showed how you can kill. Right in the spot. - It's true. - Write! (dramatic music) - You've been in withdrawal for some time. When was your last fix? - Since last night. - Sam, I have an emergency down here. Can you come? Yeah. And wear old clothes. It's gonna be messy. (yells) (groans) - [Jaime] You are one of the Lord's lights, John. You've got to help all my friends to the Lord. - I'm sick! Help me! (sad music) Why are you guys doing this to me, man? - For yourself. Two more days and your body'll be rid of that poison. - Why?! You're getting me, for trying to rob you and the old man, is that it? It's the car. You're getting me back, for stripping the car. - Did you know that? - No, but that's okay. If he keeps up though it's gonna be harder. It's a good thing I'm dong the Lord's work and not mine, I might slam those teeth right down his throat. - That's an interesting cure. - Well it may come to that. - Lie down. Lie down, easy, it's alright, Sal. Go ahead. You're doing fine. Okay. You alright, John? - I think so. (coughing) I don't like this kid, Father. I have to love him for Your sake, but, it's not easy. I hope his spirit is in better shape than his body. He's abused both. Give me the strength to-- (yells) - John?! - It's okay, I'll take a break in half an hour. (groaning) - Let me die. - You were created to live, Sal. You chose this living death on your own. - I need the stuff. - [John] Why did you start? - To get away from this hell, the streets. - I tried to drown my life in alcohol. You tried to drown yours a different way. Didn't work for either of us. - Don't understand. - Your Father understands. - My father ran away from us. When I was a baby. - I'm talking about the Father who made you. You think you've got pain, Sal. Well imagine this. Imagine someone whipping you until your back is a piece of raw meat, and then shoving a crown of thorns down onto your head. And then they put a heavy beam across your shoulders. And they make you carry it all through town, to the place where they're gonna kill you. And when you fall down under the weight of the beam, they whip you some more. And then they slam your body down against that beam, with a crossbeam for your arms, and they jerk your arms out, and they drive steel spikes into your hands and into your feet! And then they pull you up, so that all of your weight is on those spikes. And then they drop the beam into a hole, and pain tears all through you! And then, they invite anyone who wants to come, to watch you die for three hours. Now that's pain. How would you like that? - Nobody would do that. That's sick! Why would somebody do that? - He was being punished to save you, Sal. And me. Someone did that for you so that you could live. - I never heard. You're nuts! - His name was Jesus Christ. And his Father is the God who made us. And He died just like that, so that you could live forever. His Father let His own son die for us. - His Father didn't like him much then, either. - He loved His son. But He loved us too. Would you like to hear more? - All you have to do is ask. - I can't believe it's that easy. - What's easy? - This dude says that anyone can become a Christian if they just ask God. That don't make no sense! - Why not? - It's gotta be harder than that. I mean, why would he give so much for nothing? Like me. - I hope you left me some coffee. - Hey, don't leave me now. - Oh, it's your turn. Bye. (serious music) - You don't make it hard, for the people you love, Sal. You try to make it easy for them. Well, God loves us, and He tried to make it easier for us, to come to Him. - Well, that old dude said that all I had to do was ask God to forgive me for being (coughs). And, just tell God, that I accept Jesus, and believe in Him, you know Jesus, and that's it! - That's close. It's all here. And this is the first step. (serious music) - There is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. - [John] What do you think of that, Sal? - I dunno, man. Everybody sins. Does wrong. I dunno man, I'm been wronger than others. I mean, I've really done it. Sinning. God won't forgive me. And why should He?! See, it says right here, for the wages of sin is death. (banging on door) - Don't stop there, Sal. Don't stop there. It goes on to say, but the gift of God is eternal life, in Christ Jesus our Lord. - I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through Me. The way, the truth, and the life? So that's why you're doing this, huh? I mean, you follow this Jesus, and you're supposed to run around helping people like he did? - In a way. - That's crazy, man! I mean, everybody'll rip you off. Like I did. You'll end up with nothing like He did. - Sal, you think small. Do you know what eternity is? It's forever. So what's this short life compared to forever? Christ died to give us eternity. Happiness without end. It's more than a fair bargain. Even for a small-time thief. And He took a thief to heaven the day that He died, you know. He was especially interested in thieves and failures, men and women who've sinned a lot. Like me. Like you. - What's repent? - Be sorry for your sins, and ask forgiveness. - Oh. Repent and be baptized. Every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ. So that your sins may be forgiven. Yet, to all who received you, to those who believe in His name, He gave the right to become children of God. All. All? - All. Here I am. I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in and eat with him, and he with me. - Anyone? - Anyone. - Look, but you were somebody before you fell off, right? A doctor. And he was, well he cared about somebody like you. But me, I'm a nothing. I've never been nothing. Anyone? - Anyone. Remember I told you how the shepherd left his 99 sheep to find his one lost sheep? He wants you, Sal. - It's hard to believe that You want me. But You said so in Your own book. Okay, I'm nothing. I'm never been nothing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being a nothing. And a thief. A liar, and hop it, all of it. But if You could die on the cross for me... Sorry. I'm opening up that door. You come in, and You stay with me. I'm Your man. You take my life, and You shape it up the way You want. Okay? (pleasant music) - [Jaime] For all have sinned. Fall short of the glory of God. - [John] The gift of God is eternal life. In Christ Jesus our Lord. - [Jaime] And we confess our sins. He is faithful and just, and he'll forgive us our sins, and cleanse us of all unrighteousness. - [Sal] Repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, so that your sins, may be forgiven. - [Mary] Seek Me, and find Me, when you seek Me with all your heart. - [Tom] God demonstrates His own love for us, in this, while we were still sinners, Christ died. - [Sal] I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me. - [John] Enter the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in and eat with them. - [Penny] God so loved the world, that He gave his-- - [Sal] One and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life. - [Mary] For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord. Plans to give you hope, and a future. (pleasant music)
