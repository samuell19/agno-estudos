This is Gunnery Sergeant Dave Torres, M-SOT Team Leader of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion based out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. One June 5th, 2018, I took a six-man team on a special-purpose extraction mission to an opium factory in the Nad-e Ali district of the Helmand province in south-western Afghanistan... Go! ...where intelligence showed the hostage, a professor from the American University was held. Military operations by the Highlanders of the 1st Marine Division earlier in the night softened the target, but there was still resistance. That put us on a tight clock. Five minutes, in, out, done. RPG! As we got within 20 meters of the enemy stronghold, a combatant at the door was alerted to our presence. Staff Sergeant Paulson and myself engaged. Clear that door! Paulson's hit! Sniper at our six! I pulled Staff Sergeant Paulson inside the factory after he took enemy fire and called for the team medic, who began triage. Medic! There were plastic sheets hanging from the ceiling, obscuring the hall. The mission itself, with its covert operation, relied on aggressive action and speed. Every soldier on the force knew our personal security was at grave risk. After the grenade went bang and blew the fuck out of everything, I called out, trying to pinpoint the location of the hostage. Johnson and Razor provided backup and engaged the enemy. After locating the hostage, the team cleared the room, making sure everything was safe. And we escorted Professor Byers to the extraction site. Man down! Move! Move! Move! We triaged the hostage on the 30-minute flight back to Bagram Airfield. He was declared deceased upon arrival along with Staff Sergeant Steven Paulson. - Tough mission. - Yes, sir. Staff Sergeant Paulson paid the ultimate sacrifice. And you, Gunny? What price did you pay? All good, sir. You've been fighting this war for 18 years. You've infilled and exfilled on more special operations missions than seems fair. You've sacrificed a lot for your country. Hell, the Marine Corps is running out of combat action ribbons to give you. You're five months away from your 20-year retirement threshold. Get your dick out of the dirt and get home. And do what exactly, sir? Bag groceries at Kroger? Work the plumbing aisle at Home Depot? You're a hell of a MARSOC operative. About the best small-unit tactician I've ever had. Special Warfare Operations is paying decent money for guys like you. I could make a few phone calls. I didn't sign up for money, sir. That's the wrong metric to measure what we do. I'll stick it out. Okay. All right. I'm sending you and your team on an exfil training mission with the Israeli Air Force. - Commando unit 5101. - Shaldag? That's right. Golan Heights, Israel. Are you rotating me out, sir? Gunny, you got five months left. Go easy. Get out of this war alive. As the world's attention seems to shift away from Afghanistan to another middle-eastern hotspot, Syria, where bloody civil war has been raging for seven years. The United Nations Human Rights Office estimates nearly 500,000 people have died since the conflict began. Experts say the death toll has created a humanitarian catastrophe. The world is struggling... Israel and Iran stare each other down across the expanse of Syria. So here is my message to the rulers of Iran. Your plan to destroy Israel will fail. Damascus claims the Syrian Air Defenses were successful in intercepting hostile Israeli missiles. Israel will do whatever it must do to defend our state and to defend our people. Israel's Iron Dome intercepted all but a few of the enemy rockets. Experts believe Iranian-backed Shi'a Islamist militias are behind the attack, as many parts of the Syrian Golan Heights close to the Israeli armistice line have fallen under pro-Assad control with the Golan Freedom Brigade having the strongest presence in the area. Come inside, baby. It's the last night of our vacation. Give me another minute. One minute. Everything okay, baby? Yeah, everything's fine. Go back to sleep. It's nothing big. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying to you. I'll meet you for lunch. I'll be in Tel Aviv. Flight leaves Eilat at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Then I'll meet you for lunch in Tel Aviv. Make love to me. Baby, I can't. I don't have time. That never stopped you before. Come on. You can't resist me, stop trying. I know I can't resist you. I love you so much. There is no military strategy on how to deal with the influence of Iran and Russia. I think diplomacy will fail. Assad, for all political purposes, has won the civil war. Damascus will fall into the hands of Moscow and the Iranians. Which will be a total nightmare for the Jewish state, and by proxy, the United States. We have to prevent this at all costs. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to catch the last couple of innings of the Red Sox-Yankees game. Senator, it's your son. Ronan? What's up, old man? I'm doing good. It's great to hear from you, son. It's late there. Is everything okay? Everything's perfect. I'm just checking in. Hey, you see the Yankees-Red Sox game? Oh, don't tell me what happened. I got it on my DVR. So, you cycling? Always. Always, Dad. I miss our summer rides. Well, you'll be here in a week, and I just happen to have a bike tuned up and waiting for you. I'm looking forward to it. You gonna be able to make some time for me? I don't know. Avigail wants to sit and talk politics with you at the kitchen table. But listen, that's kind of why I'm calling. Dad, you're going to be a grandpa. No shit. No shit! Wow. That means I'm getting old. You are old. Deal with it. Go fuck yourself. I love you, too. How's the new wife? I know, she's too young for me. She's not too young, Dad. She's too pretty for you. You know, it's five years ago today we buried Mom. Yeah. Yeah, I know. She lived a good life, right? Better than most. She'd be really proud of you, son. Mookie Betts smashes a hanging curve ball to hit a three-run homer in the ninth to win it. I love you, Dad! Hey. Dave Torres? Welcome to Israel. Follow me. Damn, it's hot as balls out here. Yeah, well, you know what they say. From the frying pan to the fire. That's not what they say. They say, "Out of the frying pan into the fire." - Oh, is that what they say? - Yeah. Well, that's not what I say. What the hell is this place? I can tell you what it ain't. It ain't the fucking Four Seasons. It's an old Syrian camp from the Six-Day War. For us, it's our rendezvous point. The chopper will be here at 0700. That's in 62 minutes. I thought it was just a training exercise. Yes, it is, but IDF wants us to jump right in. Train like you fight. That is a credo of yours, right? Where's our gear? Let's find some shade and gear up. You know, in all this hurry, I didn't catch your name. I didn't give it. So, Jackson. We're not gonna do this again, are we, Benny? We are, we are. We're gonna do it until I can wrap my brain around it. So, Dad's a politician with serious swagger. Self-made. Catholic and proud. Mom's a mom, a good Jewish mom. Great Jewish mom. Wait. A Jew and a Catholic? Fuck me. I know. Crazy, right? The guilt trips must have been off the charts. I guess Mom had to be a freaking 12 to get the attention of a rich blue blood from Boston. So, uh... Mom meets Dad, Dad dips his wick in the Galilee. Really? We're gonna do this? - Along comes you. - Really? Silver spoon, private school, limousine. And I'm sure you've banged your share of that sweet Ivy League pussy on your way to graduating cum laude from MIT. That's magna cum laude. Magna-cum for brains is more like it. Who gives all that up to make Aliyah and fly jets for Israel? This is the Law of Return, right? Over a Sabra girl? You know what? She is a good girl. - Good. - Good girl. She must feed you as good as she fucks you. No. No, man. See, that's the thing. She feeds me better than she fucks me. All this talk of your smoking hot mom and perfect wife is giving me a hard-on. - Oh, you want to talk about my mom? - Oh, yeah. - Don't do it. You hear me? - Huh? Over the top! Over the top! You wanna fly my stick today? Hey, Gunny, I thought this was meant to be a cushy little training gig, man. What the fuck, boss? Surely we're too good for this "two weeks in the shit prep for war" stuff. Training never ends, Sergeant Fuck Face. That's what I thought you'd say. Thank you. Let me tell you, boy, I was looking forward to chasing some grade A ass out there in Tel Aviv. I mean, I heard them Israeli girls, they love them a little bit of chocolate. You know what I'm saying? Johnson, you're so fucking pretty, all the Israeli girls gonna love you. And their fucking brothers, too. I'm pretty and proud, motherfucker. Hey, Razor, how many languages you speak now? Let me see. Uh, English, Arabic, Farsi, Kurdish, French and a little Pashto. You don't speak Spanish? Nah. But my cock does. Okay, that's a good thing, huh? Yes. Hey, Gunny, what did he say? Did he call me "fuck face"? Sarge, what did he say? He call me "fuck face"? You are a fuck face! Hey, Johnson, I'll fuck your face. Your face so fucking pretty, I'll fuck it in the night, I'll fuck it in the morning, I'll fuck it at dinner time. I'll wake up in the morning, I'll fuck it again. I'll flip your face over and I'll shave it, put a beard back on, then I'll fuck it again. I would love to see that, man. Hello. Hey, Bella. Dad. Yeah, it's me, baby. I always know it's you. You're the only one that calls the wall phone. I have a cell, you know. This is the only number I have programmed on my phone, babe. You almost done over there? Yeah, almost. You know, you've been there, like, my whole life. I know, baby. Only five more months, then I'm done. You're missing my birthday again. I'll make it up to you. We'll celebrate when I get back. It's always when you get back. I'm sorry, baby. You're coming home for good this time, right? Yeah. For good. Promise? I promise. Be good, baby. I love you, too, baby. Who the fuck are these knuckleheads? They're one, two, three and four. Yeah? What do we call you? - Five. - Exactly. When diplomacy fails and my government doesn't want to start a war, the call lands at my feet and we get activated. Our names or ranks, not important. Skull and Bones type of stuff? Yes, of course. This is your game, Major Brodetsky? Yeah, I know your fucking name. And the no-names sitting across from us, Melaku, an Ethiopian Jew from Beta. Sharhabi, a veteran of the West Bank and Gaza strip. And son of a restaurant owner from Haifa. Pardo, your newest recruit and a Penn State grad, working on his start-up in his spare time. And Brener, the blondest of the no-names, an Ashkenazi kibbutznik from Degania Bet. Yeah, I know something about them, too. Not gonna bore you with their ranks, though. Secrecy is an ethos. Our names, like God, are not to be spoken. It's our way. You think you're hot shit, don't you? Well, let me tell you, we're pretty good, too. Fuck, yeah. Now, you ready to hit the rope or are we gonna play big dick bigger dick? 'Cause that's a game you'll lose. You know what? I like you. Call me Asaf. Nah, I like Five better. So do I, bro. Rope! Let's go. Let's show these motherfuckers how the 2nd Marine Raiders do things. Shepherd One, activate electronic countermeasures and re-route to 1-3-0. Change attack, heading from the east. Roger that, Command. Transmitting flight coordinates to your onboard computer now. All right, let's start dancing. Let's take her out. Ascending to 14,000 feet. Going live. Shepherd One has reached strike altitude and received coordinates. Missiles ready to prosecute targets. Cleared for strike. Target's dead. Target's dead. Good job, Shepherd One. Get your ass out of there. Roger that. Shepherd One pushing back at low altitude. S-200, surface-to-air missile. Shepherd One, we have an inbound SAM. Your vector 0-9-0 at 25 miles. Get the hell out of there and take countermeasures now. Jesus Christ! Missile in the air. We're painted. Heads-up. Get your eyeballs out of your asshole. Look for it. Single missile tracking. All right, let's find it! Defend and keep on breaking. Roll left. I repeat, roll left. Roll left! Does it have a good lock? Damn right it does. SAM's got us eyeball to asshole. Coming in from five o'clock and closing. It's back on us. Push it over, roll right. Break left! Break right! We can't shake it. We can't shake it. Roll left. Roll left! Break lock. Ten seconds and it's on us. Go up! Pull up! Pull up! Nose to the sky! - Activate defensive program. - Working on it. We're hit! Shepherd One is hit. Shepherd One, what is your status? Over. Shepherd One is going down. I repeat, Shepherd One is going down. Benny! Benny, can you hear me? Benny! My WSO is not responding. Shepherd One, eject! Eject, Benny! Shepherd One has ejected. Richard Jackson. My God. What can you tell me? Be exact. At approximately 0700 this morning, Major Jackson's F-16 was hit by an anti-aircraft rocket while on mission over Syria. Lieutenant Nadav is presumed dead and went down with the plane. Major Jackson ejected. Have you located him? Yes. Major Jackson's ejector seat beacon is active. Did he survive? Can't confirm. "Can't confirm"? He ejected near Mach speed. That's a lot of G-forces to put on a human body, General. What can you confirm exactly? The drone-fed imagery tells us Major Jackson was alive at the time he was taken captive. By who? For a targeting layer, we don't have a concrete data-point. Where exactly is Major Jackson? The GPS on his flight vest places him in Southern Syria in the Dara'a Governorate. It's a GFB stronghold. "GFB"? Golan Freedom Brigade. It's an Iranian-controlled Shiite militia fighting alongside the Syrian Arab army and backing Damascus' bid to take back the Golan Heights. They are led by an extremist who is know to us only by the name of "Alshabah." "Alshabah"? The Ghost. He's a real beauty, this guy. We can't get a clear picture of him. His face is covered with his signature tactical shemagh, GFB head-band and his black-mirrored sunglasses. The legend he cultivates is if he lets you see his eyes, you're dead. His army is small but loyal, and brutal. We pinpoint his location, and then we lose him. He stays in the shadows, moves in the night. He has a direct line to Assad, Nasrallah and Rouhani, and gets financing from all three. We think he had a hand in the chemical attacks at Aleppo and Ghouta. - Pay to slay. - Yes. He's 100% committed to avoiding detection. Can we get gunships in there with an extraction unit? He'd see us coming and kill Major Jackson before we could get to him. May I suggest a special ops covert operation? General Betz, this is Neta Luria, Israeli Intelligence. Mossad. Specializing in covert operations and counter-terrorism. We need to scramble an extraction team. We have a tight window before Major Jackson winds up in Assad's hands. Or worse yet, gets ferried over to the streets of South Beirut. What's the window? Intelligence puts it at 36 hours, max. Thirty-six hours to... Never seeing him alive. We'll be negotiating for a dead body. This is Benghazi all over again. I can't think of all the ways this is fucked! Have you any idea what would happen if Assad found out he had the son of a United States senator captive? I'll scramble a team. Marine Corps Special Operations Command wants this. MARSOC? Due respect, he's one of ours. He's the son a U.S. senator. Yes, General Betz, I'm aware, but Ronan Jackson made Aliyah five years ago, and he's now an Israeli. Law of Return? Exactly. Your Senator's son is one of us now. The 2nd Marine Raiders are on exfil exercises with Shaldag in the Golan Heights. I know, I signed the paperwork. Well, I suggest we send them into Dara'a province now. An IDF-MARSOC joint op? It's never been done. There's a first time for everything. Shaldag is the best in the world at this kind of work. And, due respect, we don't need the Marine Corps' help. Why do I get the feeling when you say "due respect," I'm being talked to like I was a cocktail waitress in Hooters? I don't care if you think you need the Marines or not. The four stars on this jacket say 2nd Marine Raiders are on this op with or without Shaldag. Due respect. What is it they call you? Sargent Razor. This is a nickname, yes? Yeah. They call me Reza. I gave him the nickname Razor 'cause he cuts through the bullshit like a motherfucking razor. Then they should call you Sargent Gillette. Funny guy. I want a nickname. You have one, Malka. Hey, yo! What does "Malka" mean? "Malka" means "the queen" in Hebrew. Dude! Dude! Queen fucking rocks, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen, listen. There are three rules to nicknames. One, it will be assigned to you. Two, you won't like that shit. And three, if you bitch about rules one and two, you're gonna get a nickname even worse than the one you bitched about. Hey. Your world just changed. Changed how? You and your combined units are now on Task Force Judah now. Operation Get Back. Yes, sir. You and these 2nd Marine Raiders head out now. It's a joint exfil op, insertion and extraction. Mossad's going outside of the fence on this one with you. This is Neta Luria. She will help you with the intel. Consider yourselves briefed. There's no time to prep on life-sized models of the target. This is a time-sensitive mission, so we're sacrificing prep for speed. Yalla, let's go. Yalla. Yalla, vamos. Let's go. We'll work all three operational spheres, getting to the destination, working at the destination and returning home. A Hermes 450 UAS is shadowing us for the next 36 hours, giving us real-time snapshots of the battlefield. What's the package? An IDF fighter pilot downed outside of Dara'a province, Syria. Wait. This is a live op? I don't show up for anything that involves dum-dum bullets. What are we doing on this mission? It's an Israeli pilot, makes it an Israeli problem. The pilot's American born. Son of a U.S. senator. Listen, I've been on these ops before, lots of them. They're all dicey as fuck, I get that. But I'm responsible for my guys, and I lost one last time out. So I'm asking, do you have any concrete data where the package is? Or is this a hunt-and-peck? Little of both, Gunnery Sergeant. That's the best I have right now. What the fuck is this beast? On-field command post. This shit looks like it was built by LEGO. So, let me guess. This is your ride, right? Mmm-hmm. So you get all the armor and we go in no doors, no windscreen? Yeah. But you've got the big guns. Sergeant Namjoo, your MARSOC files says you're fluent in Arabic with a Levantine dialect. Yes, ma'am. But you should hear my Spanish. It's an inside joke. You'll ride in the lead truck with me. I suggest we remove nametags and ranks. This ain't our first time swinging at the piñata, lady. What's the plan? Get to the border and hold for the intel. Okay. You're lead on this op, Five? Yes, of course. If it was my call, you would stay here. This isn't your war. We've got no choice. Israel was born in war and it's sustained by the threat of war. This is between the Israelis and the Arabs. Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Horn of Africa, none of them are my wars, but I've been fighting them since I graduated high school. How is that working out for you? Hey, who's the T-shirt wearing motherfucker back here next to me? No helmet on, minimal gear, thousand-yard stare. I mean, what is this? Fucking Mercenary School 101? Yeah, he's old school on reserve. Does he talk? Ask him how is it to be a Yemenite, maybe he'll answer. I've told you, I'm Yemen from the waist down only. That's a good thing? It's a very good thing. Oh, you mean he's hung? Something like that, yeah. Well, guess that makes me a Yemenite, too, huh? I fucking love Americans. I've got a hand cannon. I'll show you later. He's seen it. He's seen it. Any progress? We pulled a team of our best men. That doesn't answer my question. We think your son is still alive, Senator, but he was taken captive by the Golan Freedom Brigade. We think. Have they made contact? Any demands? Not yet. All right, I need a no-BS assessment. How much time does my son have? Golan Heights. Unsecured. Designator? - Judah One-Six. - Switching. Get Back is a go. All coordinates and op details have been relayed to your encrypted devices. Exfiltration goes through North Command. We're gonna be on your push-to-talk frequency from here on. Hold until nightfall. Good luck. Out. He's been taken captive and being held in Al-Hrak, Syria. How far on the other side of that border fence? We drive due east from here about 45 minutes, and we'll get to a building on the outskirts of Al-Hrak. That's the short route. The short route is always dangerous. North Command Control is running this op. Are we staging here? They want us to shelter in place until nightfall. Too much enemy out there now. What kind of enemy? Don't know. Joker, Doctor Doom, Magneto. Oh, you got jokes. A real funny guy. You forgot Green Goblin. Jabhat al-Nursa, ISIS, SAA. The usual suspects. Night instead of day. They'll be gunning for us on a night run when they're pinned on speed. The Superman drug. Yeah. Got me through college. Get in, grab the package, get out. Home for shakshuka. Promise? I want you to promise me. I don't know what shakshuka is. I'm guessing it's breakfast, and I love breakfast. But I've put a lot of time downrange from these fuckers, and getting back is never so easy. So let's focus on getting in. F-16 pilot. What is your squadron? 107. You didn't fly out of Hatzerim, you cunt. You lied to me. What is your name? Ronan Hollander. 7473458. At least one of his names is correct. "To Ronan, with love, Dad. Semper Fi." Who is your father? My father? My father's name is Roey Hollander. What is your rank? I'm a Lieutenant. I'm a Second Lieutenant. Second Lieutenant. Ronan Hollander. Your rank. - Or I will hurt you. - I'm a General. You speak with an American accent. Why? What is your rank? Lieutenant. You're too old to be active. No. Are you a reserve pilot? No, I'm not too old. A Major maybe? Or a Lieutenant Colonel? I have just graduated from cadet school. "To Ronan, with love, Dad. Semper Fi." You will break. Everyone breaks. Good luck. Protocol is we sweep the first 100 meters of the road. IEDs, HMEs, landmines whatever. Roger that. Let's get to it. - Let's go. Let's go. - Guys. You ready for this, Big Time? This is my American nickname? That's right. Why "Big Time"? You're one motherfucking badass. "Big Time." I like it better than "Queen." It's all yours, brother. I hope it sticks. Why won't it stick? Sometimes nicknames don't stick. How would I know? If Gunny uses it, that means it's stuck. Are you married? Yeah. What is her name? Noa. Do you have any children? We're expecting our first. Thank you for that. But you will never see her again. And you will never see your child come to life. I am the last person you will ever see. Seriously? You're wearing a mask. Look at this face. This is the face of war. The war that will not end until we see the end of Zionism. Well... Good luck with that. Wait a second, wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Hey. You're strong. And you're well-trained. I can respect that. Your government with its Western allies poison the world against us. The world order must be reset. My government will not negotiate with you. But they will come for you. You are like a candle whose only purpose is to burn out and to be extinguished, to shed light for the benefit of others. That is the only reason you were sent to me. You can have your fun. You may break me, but you're not gonna fucking win. Who is Dad? Wait here. Hello, Avigail. Senator Jackson. Come in. Do those casualty officers have to stand outside the door? They're here to keep you informed and take care of your needs. I need my husband back. Can I get you something to drink? Sure. Sweet tea? With ice and lemon? Let me help you with that, Avigail. Here, here. Let me help you with that. I'm such a klutz, I... Watch yourself. Ronan teases me all the time. We were just on vacation last night. Come here. Hey, guys, all clear. Let's go... Got a man down. Contact, unknown position. We got a sniper at eleven o'clock, but I can't see the motherfucker. Judah One-Six to North Command. We have a man down. I repeat, we have a man down. Over. You eyes on Sharhabi? Ready? We got to move. We got to move. Cover fire. Cover fire. Anyone got eyes on the shooter? Negative. Nothing on glass. There's no joy. Gunfire, ten o'clock. Judah One-Six, what's going on out there? It's Pardo. How is he doing, Razor? Fucked up bad, sir. - What's his status? - He's dead, sir. Pardo's dead. Fuck! I got a goat herder, 700 meters, at my eleven o'clock. You see him, Five? Positive. Got him on glass. No shot. Shooter's out of range. Cover fire. We've got to get closer. Let's go. Fuck. We're still not close enough. We're close enough. No plan survives first contact. There is no perfect version of this kind of operation. - We haven't met. - Ellis R. Betz, Commanding General, U.S. Military Central Command. Abiram Yairi, Major General North Command. That's Lieutenant Colonel Mizrah from unit 5101 out of Palmachim Airbase. Our comms team activated the CREW systems and jammed the cell towers and pinged every cell signal in the area surrounding the sniper. They pick up any radio chatter? Cell phone traffic? No. Mission is definitely compromised. Do we send them or not? Well, I can't speak for the Shaldag, but I can for my boys. Send in the Raiders. Yes, sir. Copy that. North Command Control wants us to leave him here. The team is a minute out to pick up the body and close the gate. Mission Get Back is in effect. You heard her. Load 'em up. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. How far along are you? Twelve weeks. Do you know if it's a boy or a girl? A boy. I wasn't really there for him as a young man. Ronan is the strongest, most beautiful man I've ever known. He got that from some place. Tell me. Who is Dad? Take a lot of notes, Gunnery Sergeant? Yeah. Helps to clear my head of all the noise. What you writing? It's a note to my daughter. How old? Sixteen tomorrow. I drove my father crazy when I was 16. Tough age. Yeah, that's what I hear. We're on foot from here. Johnson, Melaku, overwatch. We'll search in teams of three. Man, woman, child, everyone is here to kill us. Use your discretion. Assemble on me. Switch your helmet cams on and your safeties off. Switching on helmet cam, going live. Go, go, go. Switch on your white light. Go. North Command, we got breach. Clear. Two on the right. There are hostiles coming at our two, Big Time. You are not cleared hot. I repeat, you are not cleared hot. Copy that. Holding scope. Strike team has breached and we are moving towards the package. SAA soldiers are gathering to your east. Can you buy us some time? Not without getting in a gun fight. Do what you can, One-Six. Clear. It's like a fucking maze in here. Same shit, different day. You should spread, split the risk. Torres. Sharhabi. Brener. Ask him where the pilot is. Door, right. Clear. Sharhabi, stay on the door. Brener, come with me. One-Six, we've reached the package. Is he alive? Checking. Hey, Jackson. Hey, Ronan Jackson. We need a positive ID. North Command needs a positive ID. Roger that. Working on PID. Hey, Jackson. One-Seven, this is One-Six. What's your status? I repeat, what's your status? Over. Razor, check him out. Hey, man, are you okay? Sharhabi, look at me. Are you okay? Fucking... Oh, fuck. One-Six, this is One-Eight. Brodetsky and Brener are dead. Over. Get out of there now, One-Eight. This was an ambush. We'll pick you up at the main entrance. Let's get these guys out of here. What a fucking mess. You fucking idiot. Let's stay on mission. You want me to pull them? I'll tell you what I want. I want your blue team to get me a precise location for our fucking pilot. Fuck! Razor, cover fire. - Hell of a thing we do, huh, buddy? - Yeah. Gunny, status? Over. - All good. - Run like a motherfucker. Sharhabi! - RPG. - Get down. Benedetti! Jackson, cover me. Let's get them the hell out of here, now! Let's go! Move! Move! Let's go! Hey, Fuck Face. Hey, Gunny, tell my wife I'll be okay. We need to get the hell out of here! Now! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Senator Jackson. Okay. Thank you. Now what? They regroup and they go back in. Try to get some sleep, Avigail. I need to get out. Let's take a drive. Ronan Jackson. MIT graduate. Impressive. Very impressive. Son of Senator Richard Jackson. Oh, fuck. My boss would like to meet you. Why are we stopping here? I have an asset nearby. What kind of asset? A Syrian Druze. - Did you make him? - Make her. Yes. She's been vetted and banked. Johnson, stay on the door. Ask her where the package is. I speak English. Please tell him to come inside. If they are watching, they will know we have talked. Who will know? We share the same enemy. It would please me if you do as I say. Invite him to come inside, please. Johnson. So, you look for the Israeli pilot. We do. Alshabah took him captive. Where's he being held? You know where he's not being held, I'm sure. Listen, I'm not here to fucking play games with you. Neta's vouched for you, but I've got three dead friends in the back of my truck. That's what I have. Now tell me where the fuck he is. You think you're the first man to put a gun into my face? I always come with a flower in my hand, but I have big fucking Colt.45 if the flower doesn't work. Tell me where the fuck he is. Easy, One-Eight. I'll take care of this. Your pilot is on his way to South Beirut, I'm afraid. Alshabah will present him to the Security General who will order his execution. When did he leave? Just now. Hmm, ten minutes ago. Last week. What difference does it make? You won't catch him. He's a ghost. He's spent eight years in this war and still no one can catch him. And if we could? Then you'd take the M5 towards Damascus until you hit Al-Kiswah. Alshabah will avoid Damascus. He will take an alternate route. That turns his three-hour drive into a seven-hour drive. That works to our advantage. Yes. You're already way behind. Where is this alternate route? It's a smuggler's run between Jdeidat Artouz and Darayya, on the border of Lebanon. The Heroin Highway. How do you know this? The informations are floating around out there. Easy. You just have to have to know how to sweep it up. If your plan is to intercept this convoy, I suggest you acquire more serious weapons than those M4s. I can map the coordinates for you, if you please. Judah One-Six to North Command. We're looking for a convoy that left Al-Hrak around 30 minutes ago. Our Mossad asset puts our pilot in that convoy. Go to infrared. Switching to thermal. Do we have any idea where he is in that convoy? Which vehicle? We can eliminate pick-up trucks without crew cabs. Five out of the seven. This is North Command to Judah One-Six. This is Judah One-Six. Send your traffic. Over. Continue eastbound 120 clicks and reroute to the coordinates that we've sent to your onboard computer. You're picking up time, and you should be able to head them off at the designated chokepoint. Roger that, North Command. Out. This was Ronan's favorite place. He came here with his mother. I've been to Israel a dozen times over the years. For diplomacy and business. Never a personal visit. I've never been here with my son. North Command, this is Judah One-Six. We've reached the chokepoint. Holding for enemy convoy intercept. Roger that, One-Six. The enemy convoy is approximately ten minutes out. From here until contact we're going silent. We aren't the only ones listening to comms. Over. Roger that, North Command. Out. Is it Monday? All day, Gunny. Which way is the shit rolling? Downhill, towards that road. Hell of a thing we do, huh? So, how do we do this? How many vehicles in the convoy? North Command says they're rolling with seven. What's their big gun? 23mm anti-aircraft autocannon. ZU-23. Fucking Soviets. It's mounted on a Nissan. Where's the package? Exactly which truck he's in, I'm confirming now. They don't know? They've narrowed it down to the third and the fifth technical in the sequence. The KIA K2700 and the Mitsubishi Crew Cab. He's definitely not in the lead or the rear. No. You sure about that? It'd be a tactical mistake. I think they're better than that. Okay, we need to take out the lead vehicle first. Next up is the Nissan with the ZU-23. In the shit-show that immediately follows, we'll set an assault perimeter and blast the hell out of them. Johnson, you and Melaku stay with the machine guns and put some lead into their engine blocks. We want them crippled. Razor and Sharhabi, you advance with me. We find our pilot and collapse back. How do we get out? Same way we got in. We drive. What's our big gun, sir? The Hermes 450 you got chasing us at 17,000 feet, - is it armed? - It is. Hellfire missiles, huh? RAFAEL fire-and-forget anti-tank missiles. That'll do. I'm guessing there's a couple on their wing, right? Good guess. Okay, yeah. That big enough for you, Big Time? Fuck, that's strong. Of course, it'll put hair on your balls. Listen, brother, I don't think anybody wants hair on their balls anymore. I like hair on my balls. Hey. Mind if I use the SAT phone? Thanks. Convoy's in zone. Hey, Dad? Dad? Okay. What do we got? Seven clicks out. All right. Max out your ammo. We go in five. Drone Flight Control is sourcing targets now, sir. Assault Unit Get Back two clicks from contact. Targets are green. Return fire! Cover fire! I'm going in! I'm moving in! Cover me! Second technical clear. Moving to target vehicle. Hey, One-Nine. You got any 40 Mike-Mike? As a matter of fact, I do. Light up technical number six for me, will you? You got it. Close now, motherfuckers. This is Judah One-Eight. Technical four was empty. Moving to technical five now. How you doing, buddy? Fucking Mondays! I know. Cover your back. Where is he? This is One-Eight. Hostiles down. We don't have the package. I repeat, hostiles are down, we don't have the package. I repeat, we don't have the package. We got him. We got him! We got him! We got him! Major Jackson? - Major Jackson? - Yeah. IDF number, 0345781 That's our pilot! That's our pilot! Identity confirmed! Load him up and get him out of here. I'll catch up with you in a minute. We get him? Yeah. We got him. Let's go. How are you feeling? Like cold shit. Well, the good news is, you're gonna have a combat scar to hit on the ladies. What's the bad news? You're still ugly as fuck, and this is gonna hurt like hell. Let's get you out of here. Torres is hit! We got a sniper! Where the fuck is he? Somebody give me a target! Where did the fire come from? Twelve o'clock, cover fire! Twelve o'clock! Twelve o'clock! Twelve o'clock! Twelve o'clock! Shit, where the fuck did that come from? I'm moving in! Cover me! North Command, Torres is hit! I repeat, Torres is hit! Let's get him out of here! Let's go! Come on! What the fuck just happened? They've got him. They said I'd find you here. Just, uh... I wanted to say thank you. Don't thank me. Thank them. They say Gunnery Sergeant Torres was a hell of a marine. Yeah, he was. Hell of a man, too. A big sacrifice. Five lives given for one in return. That was the job. If asked, we'll do it again. Bella, I know I've broken many promises and missed so much of your life. For this, I'm sorry. You are certainly the best thing I've ever done, and my birthday wish for you is a simple one. Always treat your mother with kindness and respect, and know that you never leave my mind. You are smart and good, and you will do well in life. I'll be home soon to make up for all those missed birthdays. I love you, Dad.
