Dear Reader: Travel teaches you to trust your intuition. That applies to sketchy street food, getting directions, and even trying new languages. And when you travel the world solo, your instincts are all you've got. Every trip I've taken has taught me something about myself, and this time, on my trip to the Sapo Rainforest in Liberia, I learned that when I'm face-to-face with a deadly green mamba snake, my brain tells me to run but my instinct tells me to stand my ground because the danger you can see is rarely as deadly as the-- Rae Parker, you're back. -Got in a couple of hours ago. -And you came straight here. You didn't go home first? No, I wanted to get this draft done while it's still fresh. I'm gonna clean those up. Since you're here, come up to my office. I want to catch you up on a few things. What do you think when you hear the words, "Icon Magazine"? Magazine for the modern woman, fabulous, uh, intrepid... International. Oh yeah, no, that was gonna be my next one. Icon Magazine's going online. We're finalizing a merger with the publishers of Lady Dame London to become... Lady Icon. Wow, okay! Congrats, Shelley. Lady Icon needs to come out strong. We need to show that, while we're good on our own, we're better together. I have the perfect story. Okay, imagine this: A 27-day solo trip down the Zambezi River... Didn't you do that already? Oh, uh, no, I think-- I think you're thinking of the Saya River, that one's in Russia. This one is in East Africa... Rae, you need to do something different. Okay, I can climb up the Denali and then ski back down the face-- You've already summited more mountains than I even knew existed. Okay, uh, well... where do you want me to go? -I want you to go here. -Oh. An underwater resort in the Maldives. Oh... No, it's--it's gorgeous. It's just, I think that trips like this are more suited for honeymooners rather than solo adventure seekers. Frankly, we're not sure where "Reservation for One" fits in the new magazine. Your readership is dedicated but it's small. You need to draw in the Lady Dames demographics. Older, more sophisticated, more luxe. Okay, so... what are you suggesting? Extreme pool lounging? We need to cut through the noise and find a more personal angle. Readers want to get to know Rae Parker better, not some bigger, grander adventure. I don't know, this is just-- this is really not me. Think of it as a luxury adventure. Find the personal angle. We need this and the Liberia article by the end of the week, so I need daily updates. I'll have my assistant sign us into a shared cloud drive. Smile, Rae, you're packing your bags for paradise! You might want to take a look. It really is a great view. I've been looking at it on my vision board for the past... well, several years. Turns out it's real. Rae Parker. I'm here on assignment. Oh, Debra Hoffman. Assignment? Huh. I am too. Sort of. That's her plane. Ready, Jared? I'll catch up with you. This could be your chance to get your course out there. She can let the whole world know about it. I just wanna do a good job for the resort. Shirt would be a good place to start. -Welcome to the Maldives. -Thank you. Rae Parker with Icon Magazine? That's me, and, um, that one's mine. Oh. Oh, we'll bring that to your room for you. -Oh. -Is that all you have? Yeah, that's all I need. Um, mosquito nets, iodine tablets, flashlights-- -Fresh coconut? -Oh, yeah. -Thank you. -Well, I can assure you, you won't be needing any of that at the Marata. I'm Jules, Public Relations Manager. Nice to meet you, Jules. You and up to nine guests will find everything you could need right here. Oh, it's just me. I travel alone. It's kind of my thing. Uh, right there is fine, thanks. Well, then you'll have plenty of space. Can I show you around? Actually, I kind of have a deadline and I need to check in with my editor. Do you guys have Wi-Fi? Of course. The password is "paradise." Anything else I can help you with? No, thanks, I'm pretty self-sufficient. Well, I do hope you find some time to relax. It's kind of our thing. Totally. Oh, I almost forgot. Our Experience Director, Jared Joseph, he's on his way, should I just-- Yeah, just send him in. -Enjoy your stay. -Yeah, you too. The Maldives, a beautiful chain of coral atolls in the Indian Ocean, is home to hundreds of shipwrecks. The story of one vessel lost to time has captivated... -Rae Parker? -The Wandering Shipwreck is a national legend that just may be... -Hello? -...a national fact -just waiting to be discovered. -Rae Parker? The story begins almost a thousand years ago when the island nation was first-- -Hello. -Ahh! -Hi. -Hi. That's quite the arm you got. I am so sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm--I'm Jared. I'm the Resort Experience Director. Rae from Icon Magazine. I write "Reservation for One." Here. -Thank you. -Well, I'll be here to help you with any experience you might need for your magazine. What can you tell me about the Wandering Shipwreck? -What about it? -I write an adventure column, and that seems like a great fit. It does. Unfortunately, it's more legend than fact. What's the legend? Well, the legend is that there was a ship called the Vakkankurun that sank almost a hundred years ago. It was carrying plundered treasure back to England. Every few years, someone claims to have found it. We actually call it the Wandering Shipwreck because every monsoon season, supposedly it moves. I love it. So there's no sunken shipwreck? No. But have you seen the downstairs part of your suite yet? There's a downstairs? You ready? How is this even real? A decade of engineering. But what we're most proud of is what you can't really see. The structure was built to be part of the reef and give sanctuary to a thousand species that call these waters home. That's a lot of fish. Fish, mollusks, crustaceans... Sharks? Absolutely. Hope that won't keep you out of the water. Oh, not at all. That has column potential. -Can I swim with them? -Yeah, sure. Nurse sharks and whale sharks are harmless. We do it all the time. Actually recommend it. There's a powerful peace being in the ocean, surrounded by life but in tune with yourself. It's a green sea turtle. It's a good omen. No matter how long I've lived here, that never gets old. -How long have you lived here? -Almost ten years. -Wow. -Yeah, I know. The Maldives isn't just where I work, it's my home now. Since there's no shipwreck for me to find, I need another angle for my article. Where should I start? Well, I've actually put together a list of activities for you here at the resort, and I personally recommend the Clarity and Connection yoga and meditation program. Thanks, I'm--I'm good. Meditation's not really my thing. It's a lot more than just meditation. You know, we help people discover their inner self. My inner self and my self-self are in complete agreement, and we were looking for something more like cave diving or mountain climbing. Okay, um... We have, uh, a hike to the jungle that goes from one side of the island to the other. I can set you up on a tour, or you can just... go by yourself at your leisure. And this time I'll be on the lookout for the green mamba. -The green what? -The green mamba. I almost got bit by one a month ago, and I heard its hiss just in time. You can read all about it in next month's article. Uh, I don't think we have those here. Well, I'll be ready for whatever you do have. Yeah, that's good. Where do I find this jungle? I'll leave you instructions in the morning. -Okay? -Yeah. Good evening. Here's your drink. Rae! Just checkin' in. You sent me to sleep with the fishes, Shelley. Show me the view. Oh, I'm jealous! I could use a vacation like that. I'm not on vacation, remember? I'm working. I'm gonna send you the Liberia article tonight. I look forward to reading it. -Aren't you tired? -No, I'm powering through. -Made some good connections. -Oh? Yeah, the hotel Experience Director seems like a good person to know, in more ways than one. But unfortunately, he said there's no sunken ship, so I'm gonna go get lost in the jungle tomorrow. Shipwrecks? Lost in the jungle? Rae, sultans stay in the Marata. Just write about that. Great view. Five stars. I'm serious, Rae. Try to connect to the actual place, not just a thrill you create there. What if I don't have anything interesting to say? Just write about how it feels. That's why you're there. I'll come up with something, don't worry. I will leave no stone unturned. Thanks, man. You know, it's only a matter of time. Yeah, I know. It's just so peaceful right now. I don't want to see that get ruined. -Who else knows? -Just us. I never even told Jules. How are you doing since she left? I'm coming to peace with it, you know? Well, I'm here for you, buddy. We only have to keep it secret a little longer, and Zara's working to get this corrected. Or until monsoon season washes it away again. Yeah. The ending's a little cliché, don't you think? No, it's great. I know it's similar to the Nahanni article, but it's not identical. Plus, that was four years ago. You're losing your touch, Rae. Am not. Okay, fine. I'll come up with something better. Won't be needing this today. I need to find a water source. I'm ready for you, green mamba. -Rae? -Hmm? What are you doing here? Getting lost in the jungle. What are you doing here? Pranayama. Prana-what? -Breath work. -Great! I'm sorry, just... keep breathing. You guys are doing great. Are you okay? You look exhausted and sweaty. I'm fine. Thanks. Thank you. Is that, uh... Clarity and Connection, yeah. You teach that? I do. Oh. Sorry for what I said... It's fine. Can I help you get back on the trail? I'll just show you on the map. Oh no, I--I... I like getting lost. It, um, gives me something to do. You know, ever since I was a kid, I always liked finding my way home. So... Head back. I can get you a golf cart. Okay, never mind. Hey, do you wanna have dinner tonight? I know this amazing restaurant. It's the most incredible experience. For you, that is. Um, a reservation for one. You--you see what I did there? Yes. No, I see. Uh, yeah. Dinner, that's, uh, that's good. Thank you. I don't think I can... Debra! Are you eating here? What? I... No, no, no, no. It looks very nice though. -But you're all dressed up. -What, this? It's old. You know, I would love a date for dinner. That's very--I wouldn't want to impose, I really wouldn't. Not at all. Let's go! I... I've never seen so many. Tuna tartare. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Enjoy. -Look at that! You know, I'm starting to feel a little guilty about eating fish out here. Why? It's what they're eating. Have you noticed that every other table here is a couple? I don't think I would've had very much fun eating alone. Is that why you were hesitating before? Don't! I'm so embarrassed. Oh, don't be. You remember I said I was on a kind of assignment? Let's just say it's not as easy as I thought it would be. What's the assignment? My husband died. -I'm sorry. -No, don't be. Uh... It was the best 30 years I could've hoped for. And as I say, it was five years ago. So, I just thought I'd be a little bit more... So, I set myself a list of adventures, my Live It List. And, um, here I am, so far away. I've come all this way for Jared's course, and... I think it might be a little bit too soon. It must be really hard. You are so brave for coming all of this way and taking the first step. Thank you. And take it from someone that does this a lot, like, a lot: There is nothing wrong with traveling alone. Hmm. Good evening, ladies. Are you enjoying your dinner? Yes, it's delicious. And beautiful. Was there anything else I can get you two? I hear the oysters are really good. Oh, and I imagine fresh. The freshest you've had. Okay, well, if that's a promise, then yes, I would love some fresh oysters. It's a promise. Well, if you don't mind, I think I'm gonna call it a night. All that traveling. But I would like to thank you for a very lovely evening. It was a pleasure, and don't worry, I have a bunch of work to do. Okay. Look over there! Your oysters. Bravo, sir! Where'd you learn how to dive like that? I learned from a good friend. -Mm, yum. -His family's been pearl diving here for generations. Sounds like my kind of fun. Where do I sign up? It takes a long time to learn, and a lot of practice, all right? I swim every morning. How long? I have a column to write. Well, the first step is breath work which, as you know, is part of the Clarity and Connection program. I know you're not interested, but maybe it's worth asking yourself why you're so resistant to being introspective. I am not resistant! Right. You know, I might understand where you're coming from better than you think. What do you mean? Well, before I came here, I thought that I always had to be pushing forward or I'd fall behind. Well, in the publishing world, that's literally true. Yeah, but sometimes it's valuable to--to slow down and look and see if the path you're on is truly what you want. I thought being a doctor would make me happy. I worked relentlessly until I actually stopped and listened to my thoughts, then I realized that that's not what I wanted in my life. No matter how hard I worked on it, it wouldn't make me happy. You know, I needed a different path. -Wait, you went to med school? -Yeah, why? Is that hard to believe? No, it's just... it's just so not you. No, it wasn't. So you just gave it all up to come out here and... pearl dive and teach yoga? It was a little less straightforward than that, but I guess it's the gist. You know, and now I get to help people make discoveries about themselves. I like that. It's kind of what I'm trying to do with my column, help people face their fears. Okay, how about we meet in the middle then? Come with me tomorrow and I'll give you your first free diving lesson. Do you have any experience in the water? Scuba certified. That's perfect. Let's say, uh, we'll meet at the activity beach at 10:00 a.m. Good night, Jared. Good night, Rae. Hey. Workin' late? Bookings are pouring in. Need anything? Really, you too? It sells rooms. They're gonna look for it anyway. So how are things going with the reporter? You got her signed up for Clarity and Connection yet? She's a classic case of, "I'm too busy to work on myself." Hmm. Sounds like she needs it more than most, then. Well, whatever she needs, it sure isn't what she wants. She's just one guest, Jared. There'll be others. She's interesting though. Don't give me that look. Good night, Jared. -You goin' in? -Hmm? Oh, me? No! Although it is on my list. But no, I'm working my way up to it. I can feel it. Are you sure? I'll be right here. Oh, thank you, Rae. But no. Today is about relaxing with a good book. I've been meaning to read that. I actually think I preordered that. This one? You know, I think this came out about three years ago. What are you waiting for, Rae? Really? Tell you what, I've almost finished it. Um, when I have, it's all yours. Good morning, ma'am. -Your coconut. -Oh, you legend! Enjoy. All right, I'm ready! -Good morning, Rae. -Morning. -Excited, can you tell? -I can. -Where we goin'? -All right, look, if we're gonna count this as a formal lesson, then there's a few things we gotta go over first. First step is breathing. We use box breaths, so we're gonna inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, then--you guessed it-- hold for four seconds. Okay, let's try it. So, in... ...two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. Exhale, two, three, four. Hold, two... three, four. That was yoga, wasn't it? Just a little bit. All right, let's get you some gear. Say cheese! -You ready? -Yeah. The water's so clear! The best ocean in the world. Come on. You're doing great. Now, the real reason we came here? Follow me. -Whoo! -That was so cool! Rae, you look like you got some sun. Oh, I did. Thinking of finding something to do around here tonight. Oh, well, there's Sunset Samba at the beach pavilion. -It's my night to lead. -Dancing? I don't know. We're having an underwater disco at the end of the week. -I'm in. -Good. Do you think you can find yourself a partner? Yes, I think I know the perfect person. Great, yes, I'll put you down. And you, what do you-- what do you do when you're not working? I like to sneak away to surf, but it's been ages since I've done that. Yeah. You know, if you think about it, we both do for work what other people do for fun. Hm. Doesn't mean it's not work, though. That's true. -What's this? -That is the Wandering Shipwreck Hunt. It's a dive tour that searches for the sunken treasure of the Vakkankurun. -Why is Jared on this? -Jared didn't tell you? He was with the divers when they found the gold. -They found gold? -Yeah! Isn't it exciting? It was just one piece, so they can't prove it's from the Vakkankurun, but it looks right. -Can I take this? -Of course. Oh, um, and I just realized that I've been meaning to read the same book for the last three years, so you should take some time. Go surf. -Oh, hi, Rae. -Hi. What do you know about samba? Oh, I know absolutely nothing about the samba. -Why? -It sounds like it's time for a lesson. Five, six, seven, eight. -Five. -Ooh. I'm so sorry. One and two, three and four. -Five and six, and seven... -Right and then... ...and eight. Great! Excellent, nicely done. Let's grab our partner. We're gonna pair up. I think we're ready to add that spin we practiced. Five, six, seven, eight. One and two, three and four, -five and six... -Oh, dear. Disaster, disaster. That's okay, we're having fun! Fun. Fun, fun, fun, fun. I don't think this is fun, you know? I think it's embarrassing, I think people are laughing. Nobody is laughing at us except maybe ourselves. Oh, gee, I--I, um, it was a great try, Rae, but I don't think I can do this. -Totally understand. -I really appreciate the invitation, I do, I just-- -Great! Nicely done. -I just can't. All right, don't worry. I'm adding the music now. Five, six, seven, eight. Five and six, seven and eight. Sunset Samba partner, stat. Go. Oh, hi. Is this meeting you halfway? Yeah, something like that. Wow! Nicely done, everyone. Give yourselves a round of applause. So, do you make a habit of coming out of the ocean like a mermaid? I was coming back from a dive. Ah. Searching for serenity? No. But I did find this. It's gorgeous. So, the Vakkankurun... Ah, yes. You didn't tell me they found gold, that you found gold. That's because I don't want you wasting your time here on some tourist nonsense. What did you find? On a dive a lot like today's, one of the divers found a small piece of gold. Yes, it could be from the Vakkankurun, or it could be from anything. Doesn't mean that it's close. But it could be. Yeah. It could. But now every tourist with a scuba tank wants to go searching for it. Sounds like an adventure to me. No. The hunts are traps, okay? They--they throw garbage in the ocean and let the divers find it. Jared, this is the story I've been searching for. I have done a lot of things, but a sunken treasure? This would put my column on the front page. Did you hear anything I just said? Oh, just a fake pirate thing. I want you to help me. You know this area. Look, Rae, what's beneath all this is worth exploring, but not because of some mythical ship, okay? Here. Keep this as a reminder of what's real. No, I couldn't. No, I want you to have it. And I'll think about it, okay? Good night, Rae. I wanted to apologize for earlier. I just, uh, oh, I don't know. I panicked. It's okay, really. I'm sorry that I pushed you to be my partner. No, it was good. I tried something new. It didn't work out perfectly, but the world didn't end. So, I want you to tell me about your assignment. Oh, well, I'm a magazine columnist. Really? What do you write? I write a column called Reservation for One. It's all about all the adventures you can have while traveling alone. -You're kidding. -No. When I say I eat alone all the time, I mean it. Well, clearly, I need to read your column. Ooh, speaking of reading, it's all yours. -Any good? -You're gonna love it. Couldn't put it down. I just need to find the time to read it. Jared, you made it. Thanks for having me. What's wrong? I can't hide anything from you. Welcome to my world. Who is she? No, it's strictly professional. Strictly professional with who? Spill the beans. There's a writer, and I'm trying to help her find a topic for her article. It's been tough, I really want to help, but she's just not interested. You mean in you or your course? Both. This is the week Monica is returning. Have you seen her since she left? No. It's not just that. Sometimes I wonder if trying to bring Clarity and Connection international is just a waste of time. Don't be silly. People love your course. The big-shot writer doesn't. She will. You have to keep the faith. What's that? This is my story. Is that a personal story about staying -at a luxury resort? -No, this is... This is gonna be so much better than that. Are you sure? There's a lot riding on this, Rae. Yes. Tick-tock. Debra! Oh! Is Jared here yet? Uh, I haven't seen him. Um... Yoga. -Wait, are you doing yoga? -Uh... Please do yoga. If you will, I will. It's on your list, isn't it? Possibly. Then I can do yoga for you. That counts as exercise, right? Absolutely. -Morning, ladies. -Morning. Um, do you have a minute to talk? Well, class is about to start, but we can speak after. That's why you're here, right? Of course. Right, let's get started. Thank you. -Morning, everyone. -Morning! Hope everyone is ready for some fun, a little bit of a challenge. Right, so I'm gonna lead you through a series of poses that allow us to be fully present in each moment. So, I'll have everyone stand. Coming to the front of your mat, feet together. All right, so we're really just finding our balance here. Pushing our weight down into the floor. And we're gonna reach up, both hands nice and high. Feeling a deep stretch, looking up. Put our hands together and come to our heart's center. We're gonna forward fold, reaching down into the ground. We're gonna step back into a deep lunge... raising our arms up into Warrior One. Arms up high. Gonna flip our arms sideways into Warrior Two. We're gonna reach forward with one arm and reach back with the other. Keep that deep lunge in the front leg. Very good. A little deeper in the leg here. Perfect. Very good, get this a little higher. Very good. Just gonna sink our hips down, relax the shoulders here, and looking forward. Perfect. Great, we're gonna come to the front of our mat. Feet together. Wow, I actually enjoyed a yoga class. Something is definitely wrong. -You were awesome, Debra. -I was... I was awesome. You know, I was wondering if maybe there was room for me in that group meditation class later. Absolutely. I'll save you a spot at the beach. Thank you. Both of you. Ooh, Rae, if you fancy a bite, just drop by later. Yeah, I'll be there. So you helped Debra come to yoga? Why are you saying it like that? I just thought that maybe it'd be you that needed the convincing. I decided to meet you halfway. Remember when you said that? Well, now I need you to meet me halfway. The Vakkankurun. Ah, the truth comes out. I'm not expecting to find it, but maybe the search itself is enough. Sounds like something I would say. Will you help me? Rae... I would love your help, but, um, I'm gonna look for it either way. I need this article to save my career, and my career is my life. So... -Morning. -Good morning. Is this where I sign up for this? Yes, we have dives tomorrow at 9:00, 1:00, and 5:00. Great, put me down for all of them. Our first dive this morning will be in a shallow atoll lagoon where you should be able to see... You are fully booked for the next six weeks. -Wow. -Keep it up, you'll be able to bring Clarity and Connection wherever you want. Yeah, I don't think it's ready for that. Yes, it is. What's not ready? I'm not ready. I have to focus on the people that are here right now. I saw that Rae showed up for a few activities yesterday. -That's a good sign, right? -No. She's just searching for information about the Vakkankurun. I think she's off doing that right now. So...help her. Is that what you want her article to be about, searching for some mythical treasure? Are you just thinking about her article, or are you thinking about her? This isn't like Monica, Jared. Whatever it is Rae is searching for, this is your opportunity to help her find what she really needs. Yeah, I just--I don't want to lead her in the wrong direction. Struggling students need extra attention. If you can't help her, who can? Jared, hi! I want to show you something. Welcome back. Hi, look at this. Wait. What do you think? Rae, I'm sorry, this isn't real gold. It's probably left over from one of those treasure hunts. Listen, I thought about what you said. If the search is enough, I think I can help you. -You can? -Yeah. My friend, Zara, lives in Malé. She's a cultural historian. She knows everything about the Maldives, including the Vakkankurun. So you're gonna help me find the shipwreck? I didn't say that, but I'm off the next two days and we can go visit her. You can see the capital city, and she can teach you all about it. Yes! That sounds great. Oh, thank you. What is that? What's what? That melody. Is that the Give Me Fridays? -You know that band? -Yeah! They were only the soundtrack to my first Arctic expedition. I had their album on repeat during college finals. -It's a great song. -Great song. Yeah. Well, I'll get a boat ready and we'll leave tomorrow morning? Sounds great. So Jared gave you this recipe? He said it's the key to his relaxation. Ah, but what is the key to his abs? -Debra! -What? I might be grieving, but I'm not blind. Are you reading my column? And loving every word. It's inspiring. So, does that mean you'll be my date -to the underwater dancing? -Absolutely. -Good. -One hundred percent. -Great! -Unless I chicken out. One step at a time. You're an amazing writer, Rae. I can't wait to hear your take on Clarity and Connection. Yeah, I don't know. All this inner world stuff isn't really my thing. An assignment like this would have to be a challenge... particularly with a distraction? What distraction? Anyone who knows what to look for can tell that fate is pulling you two together. Mm-mm, ew. I do not believe in fate, okay? I--i... I choose my own path. And what a path. Have you always been such an adventurer? Since I was a kid, um, I wanted to be either an explorer or a pilot, you know, control my destiny. I think no matter who you are, a little clarity and connection, it's got to be a good thing, right? Maybe you could think of it as scaling inner mountains. I mean, I know I hope I get up there, get a good look around. No, I--I respect your journey, but mine is not about finding what's in here. It's about finding what's out there. This is Malé. It's a small island but a big city, one of the most densely populated in the world. It's so different than the resort. There are over 1,200 islands in the Maldives and they're all different. The king used to be called the Sultan of 12,000 Islands. Wait, 1,200 or 12,000? Kings tend to exaggerate. And believe it or not, Malé used to be a walled city. On an island? I've never seen so much scooter traffic. Somehow, it all works. Oh, thank you. Hi. Look how tiny. Have you ever tried stone apple? What is this, like a tiny little apple? -Yeah, kind of. -What is it? Apple's weird cousin that no one likes to talk about? Well, maybe it's gonna be all you want to talk about. Mm, yeah, this is nothing like an apple. -Jared! -Hey! I'm so glad you could join us tonight. -I'm making garudhiya. -Zara, this is Rae. Rae, this is my friend, Zara. Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm so excited to learn about the Vakkankurun. We're going to see Shakhir before we stop by. Oh, does he have a release tonight? -What kind of release? -You'll see. We'll see you in a little bit. Like an album release? So this is my favorite spot in the Maldives. -Why is that? -Jared. Shakhir. Shakhir, this is Rae. Shakhir taught me to pearl dive. -I owe it all to him. -It's good to see you. -How are you holding up? -I'm good. And, Rae, it's nice to meet you. You're just in time. Yeah, thanks for letting us come. Do you want to see them? They're so cute and tiny! We can't touch. They hatched earlier, but we collect them and release them all together so that they have a better chance of survival. Right now is a perfect time to set them on their new big adventure. Now, we don't put them right in the water. We put them in the sand because this beach will be important in their future. Years later, when it's their turn to nest, they're gonna come back to the same spot. Jared will show you. Come on. Thanks, Shak. Wait, how will they know how to come back home? It's imprinted on them forever. Well, I say this guy is ready to go. Okay. So we're gonna gently put this on the sand and tilt it up slowly. Ooh, sorry, little guy. Let the adventure begin. Good luck out there, kiddo. Thanks, Shakhir, that was amazing. Before you leave, I have a gift for both of you. Show me your hand. Black pearls are a symbol of hope for wounded hearts. That's too much, Shakhir. -You too. -Oh! When the string breaks, return the pearls to the ocean. True love has been found. Thank you. -Tell Zara I said hi. -I will. Please, make yourself at home. Your house is so beautiful. Thank you. So, tell me, why do you want to know about the Vakkankurun? From what I know about the story already, it sounds so unique. The Wandering Shipwreck. The story begins with the treasure. The Koimala treasure, named after the first king of the Maldives, was stolen in the 12th century. -Wasn't it cursed? -Yes, until it was returned to our people. How did it end up on the ship? For hundreds of years, it was just missing in the Maldives. Until the British came. Ah, somehow, it's always the British. They tried to take the treasure to India on a ship, the... -Vakkankurun. -Yes. Its name means "burglary, theft, and robbery." -Appropriate. -The ship sank, but no one knew where. Now it just drifts from place to place, wandering the sea. That's a great story. But how much of this is actually true? -All of it. -Really? Yes. Zara's grandfather was actually part of a plan to sabotage the ship before it left the port. They didn't want to leave it to the curse alone. See why I don't want tourists going and looking for the ship? Yes, I do. -That smells great! -They're back. Let's eat. Rae, this is my brother, Nishan... -Hi. -...and my husband, Jai. Hi! Nice to meet you. Thank you all for welcoming me here. -Welcome. -It's our pleasure to have a new guest in our home. Especially when Jared brings us someone who already feels like part of the family. Smells so good. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Five stars. -I'm on dish duty. -You absolutely are not. That's for the boys. So you're having a good time in the Maldives? Oh, yeah. Today with Jared just opened my eyes to so much. You two seem good together. I haven't seen Jared this happy in a long time. He's always running away underwater. And when Monica broke his heart, I wasn't sure if he'd ever come back up. Tell me about Monica. She worked with Jared at the resort, even made plans to take his course around the world, but it wasn't meant to be. And since then, he's been a bit... adrift. Like the Wandering Shipwreck. Yes, and just like it, Jared has a heart of gold. When I first got here, that story was the only one I cared about, but he's so passionate. He makes me feel like I can find something to write about. Rae? We should probably go, it's getting late. It's too late to get on a boat. I'll make up the guest room. Jared, you can have the couch. I don't mind the couch, but are you sure you want to trade five stars for a twin bed? There's no place I'd rather be. Thank you, Jared, for today. You've seen why I moved here and now you see why I stay. I'm really happy I got to share that with you. Come on in, you two! She's a good one. How's the article going, Rae? It's gonna be fine. Remember, it needs to be personal! It needs to appeal... The Maldives is working its magic on you. It's not just the place. I'm really glad I came. Me too. So do you think you found something worth writing about? There's so much I want to say. There's one more thing I want to share with you, but it can't be in any article. Is that... What? Don't let me forget this. There's a south-moving current and a light tailwind, so we should probably... Let's jump in! Hey! Look what I found. It was on the deck of the boat. This is definitely valuable. Yeah. How has no one ever found this? Well, it's not near anything. And when someone found a piece of gold, I might have put down the wrong spot on the map. I'm gonna throw it back. It belongs to the Maldives. We could take a picture first. So you can remember. It's not like I'm gonna forget this moment. It's a big secret to keep. It's safer that way. I've only shown this to my closest circle. I'm in your close circle? I would say so. I'm really glad you got to see it. So what do you got planned the rest of the day? Well, beach is calling me, but I think I'm gonna write. I need to come up with a new angle for my article. Not a shipwreck angle. But I think there's a story here. I just need to give it time, let it reveal itself. Well, as you know, the resort does offer a lot of nice solitary areas. Might actually help you find what you're looking for. Yes, you're right. I think I know just where to start. Well, see ya. Rae. Yes. I'll see ya tonight. Good morning! Welcome to Spa Retreat! Just follow me, please! Debra! Rae, hi! You're back! You look different! What is it? Brighter somehow. Thank you! You look different too. Look at me having a meal on my own. Ah. It's been good to be here. Clear my mind. You know, I see now I can move forward, I can be a part of the world, have adventures, and I can take Donny with me every step of the way. That's just beautiful. So, will I see you at the dance tonight? Will I see you at the dance tonight? You will! And I may even dance! Oh! Well, I'd better go get ready. Ladies? It's a silent disco, so while we all listen to music and party, it is Do Not Disturb for the fish. This is so much fun! This is my song! Wow. Hi. Hi. You wanna dance? Hey, look who it is! Um, sorry, I have to go. Okay. You ready? Does he ever take a day off? It's hard to tell. Wonder who that was who was talking to him. Oh, I met her in the Koto Grill. Her name is, um...Monica. Hey! There you are! I came back to the dance, but you were gone. Um, I wanted to apologize for leaving so suddenly. It's okay. You didn't really miss much. Except the Samba. And me doing the Worm. Well, I really hope I get another chance to see that sometime. Look, um... I don't want to complicate anything in my life, or yours, or Monica's? Right, of course. I should've said something sooner. My ex-girlfriend Monica flew in today for her honeymoon, and she wanted to introduce her new husband to all of her old work friends, so I had to be there for her sake. You know, for a long time I believed Monica and I were heading in the same direction in life, and it turns out she was pursuing another path with someone else. Oh. -Sorry. -No, it's okay. I'm happy for her. Really. Especially now. -Jared-- -Hey, are you hungry? I know the perfect spot. Of course you do. Come on. I've only ever seen this kind of thing on TV. It's a Maldivian tradition. I know this probably happens all the time around here, but for me, this week has been very special. Yeah, this most definitely doesn't happen for me all the time. It's been a special week. Plus, I'm sure guys are taking you out for candlelight dinners all the time in New York. Not like this. Not at all, really. People come and... People go? You kind of just get used to... -Saying goodbye. -...saying goodbye. I know what you mean. Living here, almost everyone you meet is temporary. You know, resort guests are flying out just as soon as you've gotten to know them. But for those of us that live here, we're like a family. If you could go anywhere in the world, where would it be? Somewhere cold. I'm serious. I really miss seasons. Just like a snowy day where you don't feel guilty staying in. Oh, yeah, I used to love snow days. Just listening to the snow fall off the trees. It's kind of like its own meditation. Wait, you just gave me an idea. I've been trying to develop Clarity and Connection into something that I can bring around the world, but I've been missing a hook. What if I used unique elements from each location? Like here, we can dive the reefs. Himalayan salt cave sound bath, thermal hot springs in Iceland. Yeah, you get it! Mhm. I just think that would be so special to connect to each place in a unique way. Is this... Give Me Fridays. I don't know this song. Is this a... Samba. Just slower. Did you plan this? Well, we missed it at the dance. And we practiced. Oh, wow! Sparkly. So cool! It's the bioluminescence. The water reaches the right temperature and all the algae glows. It's awesome, so cool! Just when I thought you had quit on me! Hi, Shelley, sorry, I went on this crazy expedition yesterday and I was away from my computer, but I had a revelation. Now, hear me out. It's still me in the column, but what if there's also-- A sunken shipwreck. What shipwreck? The one you were diving on with Captain Owns No Shirts. I was worried, Rae, but then I opened our shared drive and you really delivered! I can't wait to see the column about it. But what about the column you wanted? Something personal? No one even knows about the sunken ship, so-- You're telling me you discovered it? That's unbelievable! I asked for a luxe vacation story and you found gold! Literally! Shelley, I can't write about it. I--I promised I would keep it a secret until-- Don't be ridiculous, Rae, you're a journalist! I asked you to write something special, and this is special. I can't. This will save your column, guaranteed! And frankly, if you don't write about it, -someone else will. -Shelley, I-- Get it done by tomorrow. Clock starts now. Maruhabaa, how may I assist you? Have you seen Jared? Jared. I need to tell you something. Whatever it is, I'm not sure I'm gonna believe you. What do you mean? Your editor just booked out a block of bungalows for the camera crew she's sending over. To film the exploration of a sunken ship newly discovered by Rae Parker. She has the exact location of the Vakkankurun, Rae. How? There's only a few people that know about that, and you're the only one that works for Icon Magazine. -Jared, I can explain. -I have to go. I really trusted you, Rae. I can't come up with anything. He's never going to talk to me ever again. It can't be that bad. Oh, it's that bad. Jared wants something from me that will make me lose my job, and my job wants something from me that will make me lose Jared, so either way, I lose. Talk to him. It's a big solo adventure again. My thing is solo adventures. I don't think I want to be alone anymore. Admitting that is brave. Of all the places I've been and all of the adventures I've had, I think this is the scariest of all of them. Journey of the heart. Sounds like something worth writing about. My column is about being single and seeing the world. Since reading Reservation For One, I've grown and changed, and I think it's only fair that Rae Parker should get to grow and change, too. And I think your readers would agree. You teach people it's okay to go out in the world and do things on your own. It's a good message. But take it from someone who knows. When love reaches out, reach back. How'd you get so wise? Mm, I read a lot. Jules! Oh, Rae! I hope you enjoyed your stay. I look forward to reading more of your work. No, I can't check out yet. I have to talk to Jared. Jared's left, Rae. I'm so sorry, he took off on the resort boat. But he'll be back before I leave, right? He, uh--he asked me to give you this. Take as much time as you need. The last flight's this afternoon. A pearl. I can make things right. This is Shelley Stevens with Lady Icon. Leave a message! Hey, Shelley, it's Rae. I can't give you the Reservation For One column that you asked for. I'm just not the same writer. Actually, I'm not the same person that I was when I arrived. But, um, I think this could be some of my best work yet, and, uh... ...I hope you agree. Any word from Jared? Sorry, Rae. Thank you, Jules. This week was truly special. Well, I hope we see you again soon! You'll always have a room here. You knew where to find me. This beach is imprinted on me forever. I'm sorry, Jared, that Shelley found the location of Vakkankurun. I did not mean for that to happen. The truth is... I think I'm falling for you and it scares me. I handed in my column. I'm calling it Table For Two. It's about the time I went to go find a shipwreck and ended up discovering something way more meaningful. I'm falling for you, too. I don't know what happens next, but I know that I want you to be a part of it. I realized that the only thing holding me back from taking my course to the world was me. I'm ready to take a chance, I want to travel the world with you. I think I'd better take this. Rae Parker, I can't even. You read what I sent? Read it? I devoured it! It has everything! Romance, drama, self-discovery. And you're okay with not publishing -the location of the wreck? -Okay with it? What publisher wouldn't want a serialized adventure that already has a good ending? We could publish the wreck once it's more protected or wanders off again. Is that your new column companion? Rae, I love it. Thank you. Okay, I'd better go! Bye. So, you'll be my partner, in person and in print? As long as you do the writing. Dear Reader: They say, "No matter where you go, there you are." But sometimes it's precisely where we go that changes who we are. Travel opens our eyes, and when we're really lucky, it opens up our hearts. It has been an honor to be entrusted with your hearts for all these years. These days, I've made a little more room in mine and I hope you will, too. Looking forward to growing and changing as always, together. Hot off the press. "Getting Lost, Finding Myself, and Falling in Love." Table For Two's feature debut. Wow. Well, your work's gone to print. My international course starts in a month. Where do we go next? We can go wherever we want. But for now, I'm going in.
