The Eric Rohmer company presents The Friends of Ninon What would you say if you found your friends and lovers from 10 years ago? How do I find them? In some sort of party, where you reunite with everyone you lost contact with. That's something everyone thinks about... "Let's meet in 10 years at this same hour" But nobody does it. And that's probably better. Why? It's stupid to leave each other like this, just because one got married or changed neighborhoods. But what else would you do? And what does your husband say? Does he want to invite his old friends and girlfriends too? His friend and mine are the same. I'm not against it! Anyway he won't be here for the holidays. He's staying 10 days at his parents', with the kids. And naturally you're trying to take advantage. -Not at all! On the contrary, I would've loved to go with him. But there's the fair at Chalon and the sales at Montargis. That can be rearranged. Absolutely not. Next Friday is my birthday. And I want to celebrate it big. -Look at this one, You wanna invite him? -Who? - Balthazar! Isn't he your ex? - Who told you that? You! You don't remember? - Yeah but I told you not to tell anyone! - Not even you? Yeah but now I have to tell you something else! You don't have to! But I can! He didn't forget about me. He sent me a dedicated copy of his book. Follow me. I'll show you. - That's in Greek, Is he Greek? - No but we met in a Greek island. - He knew I studied Greek in high school. - And what does it say? It's not hard with the dictionary. (Reads in Greek) "To Ninon, my Greek muse, from her grateful and faithful friend" His muse? Is the book inspired by you? No. The girl isn't me at all. Thankfully. - Because of Serge? - No, because of me. My life only belongs to me. - He's discrete, you can invite him! - No, he won't get along with the others - And after all... - What? A secret should remain a secret! Oh that's a shame, I would've loved to meet him. - Shall we make a tea? - Okay. Listen, you gave me an idea. I don't want to see him alone and I don't want to see him with the others, so I'll invite him the my shop, have a coffee to thank him. You'll be there? And what would Serge think? Of Balthazar? He's rather flattered. He's not jealous of the past. Yeah but when the past resurfaces. Reuniting with an ex especially? Are you gonna tell him? Of course. I don't see the harm. You didn't understand me. What do you imagine? My friends aren't alone. They'll come with their wives. I want to live an adventure, sure. But there won't be any drama. You think everyone will come? First of all, I won't invite all of them. Maybe 4 or 5. Not necessarily exes, nor simple friends. More like guys who had a crush on me... and remained with their grief. Thanks. - Do they know each other? - Not really. I was more of the type to separate. And now, I'll break the walls down. We'll see how it goes. You'll be there, I hope. I'm not sure I'd be comfortable in your club. Bring whoever you want! I haven't met anyone since I broke up with Thomas. Then do like me! Invite an old one. I'm not a nostalgic like you. I only look to the future. Then maybe one of the guys will come alone, and you'll like him. - More than Balthazar? - Uh huh. Xavier? Guess who? In the flesh. You recognized my voice, that's a good sign. It's you who never calls. - Is this for sale too? - Yes. Can I see it? Excuse me. I know, I know. You've done a lot of things. The nursery on Étienne Lousteau street? That's close to my place, do you know it? And the wing chair there? - Is it for sale too? - Yes - Can I see it? - She's on the phone right now. - Is that gonna take long? - How would I know? I'll come back later. Miss! Friday, I'm having a party at my place for my birthday. There will be friends. Old ones and new ones, but not many. I'm choosing very strictly. Can I count on you? Bring your wife with you. I would love to meet her! Insist on her, tell her I said so! See you Friday? At nine o'clock? Kisses! That's 3. Frederic, Nicholas and Xavier. - Is that the architect? - Yes. And he’s been very successful. You told me it was him who designed that horrible building at Etienne Lousteau! And you like it? - Not really, but... - He's a friend. Be careful, he's very sociable. You're ending all conversation topics in advance! Don't worry, I got it. Baptiste! Always in time. - Happy Birthday! - Oh thank you! They're so beautiful. Marie! Here, take care of these. Baptiste, this is Marie, my friend. -Hi -Hi I never know how many kisses it should be. - Ouch, your beard stings! - I prefer one kiss, but well placed. Still cheeky as always. - You didn't bring Constance? - No, she didn't want to come. I'm warning you, all the girls coming tonight are taken! - I only came for you! - I'm also taken. Really? - Didn't you tell me Serge went on holiday? - All the more reason to be wise. - I'm the first to come? - Yeah. - Have a seat. - Thanks. - Frederic! - Ninon! It's crazy! You haven't changed. You neither. Did you come alone? Yeah, you know, I'm no longer with Emilie. Emilie? Oh right you don't know her! We haven't seen each other since Virginie. Anyway, I had found a date for tonight. But she bailed on me last minute. Happy birthday! I know, getting a book from a bookseller is rather banal. But it's a field that I know better than candies and scarves. You'll see, it's very well written, it's a slow burn. - Didn't you go there one time? - Yeah. - You don't already have it, I hope? - No, no. - Good! Because it just dropped. - Thank you, it's very nice. - Do you have any vases? - Yeah they're in the kids' room. - Frederic this is Marie. - Hi! - Frederic... Baptiste. - Hey! - You know each other? - Yeah, didn't you study law? You have a great memory! And you? Didn't you study at the Fine Arts? Oh no no, I studied at L'Ecole du Louvre. And now I'm a booksellers. I'm now administrative director of the Pharmacom laboratory. You know it? Yeah. I don't have much free time, but I take some time to read at least. What did you think of the last Goncourt winner? Deserved, no? I haven't read it. I never read literary prizes, I let the others read them for me. Excuse me. There won't be enough space for these. What do you want? I have no other vases. Oh this Baptiste! He always has to choose the biggest and most expensive. One little rose alone would've touched me more. What if the others bring more flowers? Where do we put them? Don't talk about the catastrophe yet. You know what Frederic the bookseller brought me? He didn't do any better. - He brought you a book? - Guess which book. - Balthazar? No way! - Yep. - You have to hide it! - Yes. - Xavier! - Ninon! You cut your hair? It suits you much better. And you? Always with the same haircut? You haven't changed at all. I feel like I went 10 years back. You came alone? Yeah, you know, my wife gets too jealous. Of you, especially. I never even mentioned your party. Said I was going out for a business dinner. - But I told you I wanted to meet her! - I hope I'm more important. So, Happy Birthday! I didn't know what to get you. The other day on Le Monde, I read a very positive review, and it takes place on a Greek island In Paros. You've been there before right? Excuse the packaging, they didn't have gift paper. How nice, but... I have greasy hands from the kitchen. Put it back in the bag. - I can put it somewhere. - No! put it in the bag, so I can hold it. Come, I'll introduce you to my friend and partner, Marie. Xavier the architect, this my collaborator, Marie. - Hey. - Hey. You haven't finished? We'll help you. Leave me the bouquets, it's architecture. - Is this one done? - Yeah, it's good. - Are you sure you wanna do it? - Of course. - Here's to society? - Cheers. - These are for you. - Put them on the table. One moment. - Do you need a hand, Ninon? - No need. - Hey, I'm Frederic. - Xavier. - I'm Baptiste. - I don't know where to put these. - Put them in the trash. - He's really nice, you don't mind? - You had to keep him busy. You know what he brought me? Not flowers at least. Oh, not Balthazar! - Yep. - Did the other one see it? No. Not him nor the other. I hid everything. Poof. What a story. So, flowers or Balthazar? How suspenseful! - Oh! Nicholas, you cut your hair? - You didn't recognize me? Of course I did! But I'll have to get used to it. Happy birthday! Here. I wanted to give you something. It's not too big... But I wanted to give you a rose with the color of your skin. - This's the only one I found. - How nice of you! Nicholas, you always know what I like... - Come on, enough mocking! - I'm not! Oh there's no room on the coat hanger! Put it here, in the kids' room. Here. - Matilde isn't coming? - Oh I didn't tell you? - We're not living together anymore. - Oh? - Yeah I'm living by myself. - You didn't tell me on the phone! - I didn't dare. - How did it happen? She left me for a musician. But it won't last long in my opinion. Then she'll come back to you. - I think she'll find someone else. - You can find another girl too. - Not really, not at the moment. - You still love her? I do. But even if I find someone else, nobody wants a guy like me. Broke, jobless... Don't say that! That doesn't sound like you. You've always been enthusiastic. Look at all those guys. Making a life for themselves. While I'm still here. They have a family, a job, kids. Don't worry, that'll come one day! Let me introduce you. Marie, can you put some water then put the vase on the table? Yeah. - Nicholas... Frederic. - Hey, how are you? - Xavier. - Hey. - Baptiste. - What's up. - Marie. - Hello! I'm really happy to meet you, we only talked on the phone before. - On the phone? - Yeah. - Aren't you Ninon's husband? - No! My husband Serge in on vacation. Ah! Oh they're so cute! Excuse me, I'm making a lot of mistakes today. No, that's very flattering to me. Eh? - Will you let me be you husband for a night? - No - An hour? - No. - A minute? - Enough already. - You know Frederic? - Yes! I went to his bookstore often, but now I'm no longer in the neighborhood. - I don't see you there anymore! - I find the neighborhood ugly. - Oh you're exaggerating! - No It's true! You must be thirsty, come! No it's true! They design some ugly... - You want some wine? Bordeaux? - No I'm good, thanks. There some kind of Blockhouse... Ouch! What is it? - Yeah there's a huge blockhouse in the... - A blockhouse? Yeah! A really big blockhouse on Etienne Lousteau street. Ah! You mean the nursery? Those poor kids. The kids are excellent. I designed it. Oh, sorry! Excuse me, I'm the king of mistakes today. No. I love sincere opinions. Not bad at all! Oh! Rococo by Paul Morand. It's impossible to find nowadays. And what are these? There no need, I know how to handle books! Oh, it's the Balthazar! Hand it. If it's damaged I'll change it. - No no. - It won't cost me anything to replace it! - I dropped it, it's my fault. - It's not damaged. - Let me see at least! Hello? Yes, don't hang up. It's for you, Xavier. Excuse me, I gave them this number. Tell Ninon I was expecting a call. - Are you okay, Ninon? - Yes - Oh, sorry. - Go ahead. - No you go! - Please. I'll leave you to it. You don't think It'll be him? If I were you, I'd choose Nicholas. He's free. No, he's too sad. Not my type. - Xavier said to tell you that... - Yeah I heard everything. What are you doing? Are you crazy? I have to hide this. Frederic was groping about and almost found it. He looks bored. The others too. There's not much communication between. I suspected that, but I expected them to bring their wives. I wanted to see what kind of girls they are. You're mistaken here, that's not true. Yes. Yeah I know. Wait. I'll write it down. Yes. Wait. Of course. Look at them. Each in their corner. Let's try to unfreeze them a little. You coming? Two against four? What do you want us to do? What an idea they had to come alone! I almost wanna kick them out. I'll tell them that I'm sick. Listen, if they came to flirt, they did it on purpose. I have an idea! Let's invite some girls. What girls? It's too late. Yeah but I know plenty. They're a little young though. For better or worse. Call them. Yeah but he's on the phone! I'll tell him to hang up, It's too much! - Hey - Hi Julie! - I came with Zazi, - Hi. - Fifi, - Hi. And there's Natasha who will arrive soon. - Great! There no room here, put them on the bed. Okay. - Wait, I have more friends coming up! - Boys? - Yes. - Huh? Hello! Thomas... Ninon. Olivier. - And Frank, this is Ninon. - Hi. - Happy birthday! - Sorry we didn't bring any gifts. No I brought something. Here's a CD. I'll put it on if you want. - What is it? - It's techno. There's no room here, put it on the bed. Will you allow me for a second? - Oh a little buffet! - There's nothing to eat! Oh no! no! no! Hello! - Are you Natasha? - Yes. Put it on the bed. Okay. Listen Ninon, I really have to leave. Tomorrow is Saturday, it's my busiest day. I have to get up early. So I wanted to tell you what a great night it was. Thank you. - That's a shame. - Sorry, I'm also going. Goodnight! I'm going to the countryside tomorrow morning. This was awesome. - Already? - Yeah. I'll call you before 10 years! Bye! Ninon, I can't take this music It's driving me crazy! If we can even call it music. All my love, I'll call you. Let's try to meet soon. Bye! Okay? Let's not lose sight of each other. You know I don't like this stuff. Rock, Techno... But if I start dancing, nobody will be able to stop me! And since I told my wife that I went for a business dinner... It's good to have some fun! It'll make her happy. - That's it. - Bye! I'm sorry. Julie didn't understand me. But we can kick everyone out if you want. What? What's going on? You don't know how to dance? Come! This party wasn't a bad idea after all. I haven't felt this young in a long time. Subtitles by: HAUTBASFRAGILE
