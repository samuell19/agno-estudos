Dammit! No, no no! GHOSTING GLORIA You got books about ghosts? Are you looking for fiction or nonfiction? I don't understand. Are you looking for stories with ghosts as characters, or books with information on the subject? Books about phony ghosts... OK, I see... Over there, in the self help section, you'll find plenty of books written by phonies. Wake up! Shithead will see you. He's acting more the asshole than ever. Joey and Betty are gone, we're on our own. Why? What happened? The jackass found them making out in the back and told them one of them had to go, "No intimate among staff". So, assface told them to decide who'd go. What did they do? They told him to go fuck himself and they both left. Well done. What a sucker! My job is not to make the rules, I just enforce them. You're late again. We need to have a conversation. When you are done with that, come see me. Sandra, please, I asked you to organize the Philosophy section. You must put your alarm 30 minutes earlier. I did it, but I didn't hear it. I ended up falling asleep super late, compliments of my upstairs neighbors. Every night it's the same, they never stop. I don't get it, they hump all night long? No, just for a while, but they wake me up. And after I wake up, I can't go back to sleep. I think the solution is getting yourself laid. One good orgasm and you'll sleep like a baby. Oh! How did it go with the guy last weekend? Don't ask. He snored all night. How was the fucking? There was none. He couldn't get an erection. Please! You're a grown woman! You have to know how to deal with these things. What do you want me to do if the guy doesn't get hard? But, honey! Humping 101... First, you dismiss the whole thing. You say, "we'll talk tomorrow." Then, you pretend to be sleepy and you cuddle him as if getting ready to sleep. And then you touch him, he starts to get excited. And then you blow him until he is rock-hard. No way he goes soft again. Why would I give him head? I didn't even like the guy. Honey, you need to get laid. It's all over your face. When was the last time you had an orgasm? I don't know. You don't know? How much time are we talking about? I don't know. Leave me alone. Excuse me, do you have security cameras? - Yes. - Shoot... Listen to me, Gloria. Have you ever had an orgasm? Listen to me, Gloria. Have you ever had an orgasm? I don't know. Let me do my job. Not an option. Have you had one or not? Dickface told you to go organize the Philosophy section upstairs. I already did it, while you were dozing off. Answer my question. - I think so. - You haven't had one. What do you know? Cause you would know without a shadow of a doubt. I think I did once... finish, I mean. If you say "finish", it's because you never had an orgasm. This is a serious matter. Do you have any books about babies or how to be better parents and such? Do you have any books about babies or how to be better parents and such? Yes, come with me, this way. There is a lot on the subject in this section. I would recommend this one. It's not only didactic and useful, but also a great book. The author is called Noihal Yurahi, he's a genius. Are you expecting? We found out yesterday and we are pondering what to do, actually... He's so discreet, isn't he? Why don't you go ahead and tell her you are bisexual too? I think this book can help you with your decision. Meaning? I mean, I used to think that I didn't want to have children before I read it... - Oh, wait... Is that the price? - Umm, yes, it is. OK, thank you. We'll think about it... Wait! We actually have this one, it has some markings and we can no longer sell it. - You are free to take it. - Oh, thank you very much! Antique photographs, developed like in the old days! Great! Say Chesse! Here is the information to get it. Thank you! How nice, I want one of those photos. First you need a man... Or a woman, maybe. Add one Noihal Yurahi to my bill. - Good night. - Bye. - Hi. - Hello, sorry... I wanted to ask you... Yes, tell me. May I speak with your wife? Sure... Hi. What's up? It's just that... I don't mean to bother... it's just that the building's walls are so thin, and noise goes through them, and... Yes, modern buildings are like that, what are you gonna do? Yeah, well... I wanted to ask you... it's just that sometimes if it's very late and one is sleeping... In the silence of the night, any noise can wake one up and... My husband is a sales rep for pharma. Would you like some sleeping pills? Um, no, thank you, it's not that... it's that, simply if you could, when it's late, just watch it a little more with the noise... I would really appreciate it because... Look, I didn't make the building. Yes, the walls are thin. Not my fault. No... Yes, of course. It's just, if you'd just consider it... Don't worry, we'll keep it in mind. Goodbye! Thank you. Ah! Fuck me! Fuck me hard! Take it, you slut, take it! You gonna give me all the jizz? Are you? Will you give it to me? Hello, what can I do for you? I want to let out my apartment. - How did it go? - Rented. - So fast? Just like that? - First viewers. Great, everything solved. I love when things turn out this way. The only issue is that they need to move in by next Monday. Can I leave my stuff at yours while I search for a place? My house? Yes, is that a problem? It would only be until I find a place. You won't believe this. - What? - Hold on. Yes? Do you have the book by the doctor on the TV show? It's sold out, sorry. It isn't sold out! I know when people want to actually buy something and when they're just being a pain in the ass. Listen, you won't believe what I am about to tell you. I found out though Maurice. - Maurice? - The guy I'm fucking. - The taxi driver or the lawyer? - The bald doctor. Doesn't matter. A cousin of his, it's a terrible thing actually, he died suddenly the other day. An aneurism or something like that, terrible. You're here one moment, and gone the next. That's awful. Was he young? Yeah, a young guy, about our age. The thing is that they can't rent the apartment out because they have to wait for the will to go through. They want to rent it, without a contract, to someone trustworthy. Below market price, of course. But I'm not trustworthy to them, they don't know me. It's OK, You are my friend. - Can you...? - Over there. It's made in Heaven. Let me call Maurice and find out the details. - No, wait... - What? - But, when did he die? - Last week. I think. Why? - Did he die there? Inside the apartment? - How should I know? Does it matter? I would be weirded out to go live in a place where someone just died. Nothing is good enough for you! You have to move asap. I find you an apartment... And you say you would be 'weirded out' to go live at a place where someone just died. Do you think nobody died in the places where you've lived so far? Well, surely they did, but I never knew about it. This is different, I would have to think about it... Do you have any books with a cover in fuchsia and light blue? Because I want it to match the wrapping paper I got. Fuchsia and light blue... Let's see... Follow me. Hi, Maurice? How are you? Me too. Are you taking out your scalpel? - This goes in the kitchen, right? - Um... yes. Yo, party at Pete's today, you on? I don't know. I'm gonna be tired after the move. Come on, woman. Where's your spirit? Live a little! You say that 'cause you'll sleep until midday. I have to be up early. If I don't go to the phone company early, there'll be a lineup, and I'll have to waste half a day. If I go alone, this guy will think I'm desperate. I'll help you with the move, you come with me to the party. Which one is he?The doctor, the taxi driver, or the lawyer? The dentist. What does "apparition" mean? "Apparition"? Let's see... let's look it up in the dictionary. What do you have there? One of your conquests? No, this was here. I think that's the guy who used to live here. Poor thing... You think so? Yeah, I met him once, now that I think of it. What can I get you? Beer, whiskey, rum, tequila, wine? A glass of wine. Good music, huh? It's a friend of ours, he's an audio tech wiz, loves to DJ. He's cool. You know, I don't really like this music. You don't? What do you like? Actually,I don't get how anyone can like this music. Why so radical? This is good music to have a good time. Not everything must be intellectual, don't be a snob. I don't think music has to be bad in order for people to have fun. Or that good quality things are elitist or intellectual. Also, if I'm too "radical" for you, that is my business. I don't need anyone to tell me what I can or cannot be. You're a tough one. I like my women with a bit of spice. What do you do for a living? - I work at a bookstore. - Ugh. So boring. it's not all fun and games, but... I don't see why you'd think it's worse than any other job. I mean, cause you must be quiet all day, with people reading there and all. I don't work at a library, I work at a bookstore. What's the difference? Excuse me. Frank's friend is crazy about you. I don't care, he's an ignoramus. How about July's cousin then? He likes Nietzsche and all of that... But have you seen the poor thing...? He looks like Nosferatu. Nothing's good enough for you. Something's gotta give, you can't have everything. Are we leaving? I'm exhausted. I'll be a zombie tomorrow if we don't. I'm going home with Frank. Do you have enough money for a taxi? - Yeah. - OK. Come in. Sorry to interrupt, I brought you the chart you requested. Oh... If you have any doubts... - Thank you very much. - You are welcome. - Sorry for the interruption. - It's OK. OK. Let's continue, Tell me... Is it the first time something like this happens to you? Yes, I've never seen anything like this. But, do you mean to say that you are convinced that this really happened? I am convinced that I saw the things I saw.But I don't know whether... ...There's something wrong with my head and I'm seeing things that don't exist... That's the reason I came to see you. What were you doing when this "happened"? I had just gone to bed. You were already in bed. Do you think you were asleep while these things were happening? No, I think I was awake but... maybe I wasn't. Going back to your insomnia problem. How long have you had trouble sleeping? Some time, months. Excuse me. I HAVE 30 MIN. MEET ME AT MY OFFICE. Have you had headaches, nausea, or vomit? Any problems seeing properly? No. Did you ever get diagnosed with any other issues? Not that I know of. - Hypertension? Thyroid problems? - No. - Do you smoke? - No, I don't enjoy it. As a teenager I... Ok, I'm gonna request a couple of tests. And I'm also gonna give you something so you can sleep soundly. I don't want to take pills. I'll give you very mild pills. Look, there is something called hypnagogic hallucinations. They happen when you're somewhere between sleep and wakefulness. But you believe you're truly awake. I don't think you have a mental health diagnosis, you don't fit the profile for a psychotic episode. So, I'm not crazy? Go do the tests and take the alprazolam to sleep. If it happens again, come to the ER, or else I'll see you next month. - Make an appointment. Good luck! - Thank you. I'll be right with you. How did it go? He gave me sleeping pills, I don't want no pills. You haven't slept all week, you suck at work, I gotta do everything. Plus, Mr. Assface is on to you. Take them, at least to keep your job. Help! Help me! What's happening? It's the new girl. Go help her. - Why do I have to go help? - Go! Are you OK.? Do you need help? I'm OK. It's nothing! -Are you sure? Yes! Thanks! Good morning! That's the way, wearing make-up. You should always wear make up, you look amazing. - I'm not wearing any make-up. - What did you do, then? You look completely different. I don't know... Nothing. You slut... You had an orgasm last night, and you don't want to tell me. You naughty little bitch, you got fucked hard last night, spit it out! Hi, I'm looking for Hugo Fattoruso's biography. Yes, come with me, this way. We have several. Do you know the title, the author...? Yes. It's the one that talks about his life. - Yes, that's what a biography is. - Exactly, can I have that one? I meant... a biography is the story of someone's life, and we have several Fattoruso biographies. How about one that has many pictures and not that much writing, then? This is called "His life in pictures". It's pretty much all photos and no text. - Thanks. - My colleague will charge you. Actually, I wanted to look around a bit... OK, sure... feel free. I'm over here if you need anything. Don't think you can avoid me. Tell me everything, you slut. Mr. Assface is coming, Let me work or you're gonna get me fired. - Who is he? - No one, we'll talk later. THE INVENTION OF YOUR REALITY. REALITY IN FANTASIES. REALITY APART. 9 STEPS TO TURN YOUR DREAMS TO... ...REALITY. Hello. Have you got the new Strindberg? He hasn't published anything since 1912. He died in 1912, he didn't publish anything since 1909. But I heard they just published a new book with paintings and unpublished works. You are right. It was supposed to arrive this morning, but, apparently, it has been delayed. If you want to leave your number, I'll let you know when we have it. Great, My name is Angel.I'll give you my number, you give me yours. Here is the bookstore's number, if I am not here, my colleagues can help you. Actually, I'd like your number to ask you out. THE SPIRIT'S REALITY.. Can I have it? - Huh? - Your number. UFO'S FABULATION OR REALITY. Thanks, I'll call you. Gloria. We need to have a serious talk. He's a son of a bitch. He almost fired me because he thinks I was hitting on a client. But, were you or were you not hitting on him? I wasn't. He asked for my number, and I gave it to him. I was only trying to be nice, that's all. This guy is such a killjoy, it's not like he's the owner or anything, He's just the manager, an employee just like us, he could turn a blind eye. So, what about that guy? You like him? He's interesting. - Hello. - What happened? I just burnt myself with the iron, I'll call you in a bit. - Are you OK? - Yes. I'll call you back. HI. I'M ANGEL. CAN WE MEET? OK, you'll open the store tomorrow. I'll be here at midday. I'll call you at 9:30 to check up on you. That's not necessary. If you want, I can call you if there's any problem. Whatever works. See you tomorrow. Excuse me, are you closed? Yes, can't you see...? Sorry to bother you, I got off at the wrong stop and got lost. No problem. I'll let you in Beautiful, so many books. I didn't remember you had a second floor. Can you see? No. But I can feel things. The heat of your hand near my face, for example. I'm sorry... Don't worry, I'm used to it. Can I ask you something personal? You want to know if I was born blind... - Were you? - Yes. I lost my sight as an adult. Nobody knows what happened. You don't know why you went blind? They say no one's blinder than a person who doesn't want to see. I didn't want to see certain things... ...And that is why I am now condemned to see them at closer range. - Closer range? - Yes. Yes, to see you, for example... I have to get close. Coming this close I can "see" deeper things. For example, I know you're scared. Don't be afraid of your senses, they are a wonderful gift. They can cause harm,but they can also fill your life with joy. Can you fall in love with someone without seeing them? I'm not going to lie, if I could choose, I would choose to be able to see. But since I can't, the only thing left to do is enjoy everything else to the fullest. The best player is not the one with the best cards... But the one who knows how to best play the cards that were dealt to her. You must be wondering what a blind woman is doing at a bookstore. I am looking for a book for a friend. - Were you looking for anything specific? - Yes. "The lesbian Kamasutra". Sandro, come here! Are you OK? Yes, I'm good. Thanks! Are you sure? Yes! Leave me be! Hello, do you have the new Strindberg? - Yes, we got it today. - I'll take it. It's bullshit anyway, it's the same as the previous edition... Except they added a prologue and a few pictures. Yes, that's the one. It's super expensive, do you know how much it costs? Sure. Fucking hipsters... I'm in a hurry, you know? I'm sorry. Here you go. Thank you, have a nice day. Hello, Angel? I'm calling from Puro Verso Bookstore. I wanted to let you know that we got the book you wanted. So, you like Strindberg. Yes, but the book wasn't for me, it was a present. Do you like Swedish literature? Not really. I like good literature, wherever it may come from. Yes, same as me, actually. Don't know why I asked that. It's like when someone asks you if you like a certain musical genre. It's absurd. Yeah, I never got those people who listen to only one genre... It's bizarre. The great thing about this place is the music is cool. Yes... I mean, at least, they have some criteria. Certain places put so much attention to detail, the tablecloths, paintings, everything... And they neglect the music. Everything that has anything to do with sound is important to me. And to me, trust me. I am building myself a place in the countryside. Really? How cool. I will keep my place in the city to stay over when I need to. But for quality of life,waking up every morning to singing birds... The wind whistling through the trees... that's priceless. I always thought I'd like my kids to grow up near nature. Of course, no doubt about that. There's a good school there too. - And well, I moved here. - It's amazing, really. You were lucky. Thanks. - Can I play some music? - Yes, sure. There. Oh, okay... I think it's terrible that people don't slow-dance anymore. I would have loved to live at that time. It was good, then. But that was a different time. What does have to do? I don't live according to what year it is. I live the way I want to live. Shall we dance? What was that? Nothing, just the wind. I must have left the bedroom window open. Holy shit, that was scary! The music was cut off too, strange. Yeah... You know what, it might be for the best. I have to get up early. You work on Sunday? No, but I have... to work on some things. Ok. I'll leave then. - I had a great time. - Me too. Bye. GHOSTS (Google search) SPIRITISM (Google search) CONTACT THE OTHER SIDE, NOW. Contact the other side, now? Please stop goofing around and work, "now." I leave you for one minute and you are always up to no good. Looking for a loved one? Um... Not exactly. You want revenge against someone who hurt you. Ummm... No. You want to get rid of a spirit that's messing with you? No, but you're getting close. Ok. Tell me. I am living with... something, or someone, who sometimes shows up at my place. The thing is... he's been gone for a while... and I want him to visit more often, I mean... Why do you want it to visit you? Well, last time... How should I put this? Let's say there's unfinished business between you two. Yes, you could say that. Something good? Yes, something awesome, actually. You have to recreate the same conditions of the first time it manifested. I had taken a sleeping pill that time... No! No pills, they're very dangerous in these cases. Go to your house, get comfortable, Light up the incense you'll purchase from me, it's really good, and relax. Lie down and relax. From here, I'll cast a spell for the entity to manifest at your house. - You won't be there? - No. I'll cast the spell over the distance. I'll need you to buy certain things though. Take note. One green candles, one white and one pink rock crystal... Two sandalwood, three lavender incense, one spirit catcher candle. And one violet amethyst stone. Sondem augustus vardet. Wandering spirit looking for ease. Return to the walls that have felt the mourning. A mortal soul is summoning thee. A tie between worlds you are bound to cause. You shall be welcomed. Your presence is sought... by one helpless soul. Keep her company, and do not forsake her. Shape her waking hours with your permanence. Come to life... Return. Your soul in sorrow will be received. Noble entity, thy will be done. Noble entity... thy will be done. Come back... come back... Urgently manifest your presence. Manifest your presence! Manifest your presence! Hello, I am looking for a book, I can't find it anywhere. - We don't have it, OK? - Oh, OK. Wait. Do you know the title or author? I think it is "The Omen" by Herman Hesse. There's no such thing, actually. I have the script to the movie "The Omen" by David Seltzer; The main character is named Damien. I also have the novel "Demian" by Hermann Hesse. Oh... Silly me. But you can take both. In fact, they are complementary... in some way. My boss will charge you. "My boss will charge you", Since when do you call this cum-eater "boss"? Hey! You got a problem with me? Watch your mouth, we are not on good terms right now. - What did I ever do to you? - You have been dating for a long time... And you have abandoned me, you haven't shared anything with me. Not even his name, it's like you're dating a ghost. Why are you looking at me like that? You got nothing to say? I'm sorry. You're right. t's just so complicated. Come have lunch with me and I'll tell everything. Tell me everything, don't beat around the bush, you'll give me the details later... Tell me everything, don't beat around the bush, you'll give me the details later... OK... I have to tell you the whole story, or you won't believe me. Fuck! OK, go on then. Remember when I called you in a fit cause I had a ghost at my place? Yes, pathetic. Well, he showed up again. What do you mean he showed up again? What happened then? - We had an encounter. - What kind of encounter? Sexual. ¿Do you mean he literally...? Don't worry, I'm not crazy. I know what went down, and it was wonderful. Really? The best thing that ever happened to me. I didn't know what sex was until that day. Details. Tell me what he did. I wanna know everything. I'll tell you later. It happened a few more times... And the second time? - Better than the first. - Unbelievable. But after that he disappeared. But I just couldn't... live without it anymore. Of course, how could you? So, I contacted him, I consulted an expert and he showed up again. Was he good then too? It only kept getting better. Fantastic! And, well, I've been involved in this romance for a while. But... Tell me, how does this thing work? 'Cause I don't really understand. It's perfect. Because... We don't only have a rare sexual chemistry, I enjoy certain things with him that I have never been able to enjoy with other men. I can talk to him for hours and he never interrupts me. We don't have to argue about banalities. Who takes a shower first... Whether he left the towels on the floor, nothing like that. Plus, I no longer pay for electricity because he powers everything. It's beautiful to find out that a night with the right company... Can turn any day into a magical moment... And I have all the advantages of being single. The toilet lid is always down, the toilet paper is placed on the right side... The toothpaste is never pressed in the middle. But, also, at the end of the day I have someone to cuddle when I go to sleep. And do you know anything about him? Does he have any way to communicate with you? What is your name? Dante. And the sex? Details, please. It's crazy. Sometimes we spend hours having sex. He doesn't get tired and he doesn't need to rest between one time and the next. Doesn't it ever get boring? One day I asked him... Wanna try something different? What are you planning to do? Where is this going? I don't know... I plan to enjoy it while it lasts. The idea of knowing what awaits me when I go back home... it's hard to put it into words. I never felt like this before. I'm home. Hello! THE TIME HAS COME, YOURS FOREVER, DANTE. You arrived just like a promise. Unlocking my days and you rearranged... Patiently, the old and cold nights You were a builder of my smile... And you accompanied my pain. and you discovered... ...In my eyes... ...Behind of the fear your image. And you gave me the mystery that I didn't try to reveal. And you teached me that thing that I am not able to name. And now it sleeps on my side and I don't know what it is. That wakes up next to me and lights up all my skin. I am willing to find no reason or sense in it. Remain alone with the silence.... ...Of that empty space Gloria, it's Sandra, you didn't come to work today either. You have me worried. Are you okay? Call me. And you gave me the mystery that I didn't try to reveal. And you teached me that thing that I am not able to name. And now it sleeps on my side and I don't know what it is. That wakes up next to me and lights up all my skin. Gloria, it's been a whole week. We are very worried. You are not answering your cellphone. Call back, please. Hello, real estate office? Christine? How are you? It's Gloria. Yes, that's the one. Look, I'm calling because I wanna get my apartment back. What should I do? - Is this one ready? - Yes, give me a second. No, we can carry it together. You are carrying everything, it'll kill you. Thanks. Help him. You didn't lift a finger, poor guy. He loves it. That's why I brought him. I got him from an S&M website. What is that? There's people who like having a master dominate them. He's my slave. I checked it out, just out of curiosity, and this one messaged me. How many guys are you dating? I don't know... a few. One has to fuck. But, do you enjoy the sex? Well, not always. But I'm single, so, no one bothers me. Haven't you connected with someone to a whole other level? - What do you mean? - Another level. When was the last time you fell in love? - I don't know. - What? How long are we speaking? - Haven't we discussed this already? - No, I would recall. Sandra. Have you ever been in love? I don't know. I believe so... Or you did or you didn't. Well, yes. A literature teacher in high school. - You fucked a high school teacher? - No, you're nuts? He was an old man. Anyway... I idealized him. Aparicio, that was his name. I loved his mind. He had a whole world in his head. I used to stare at his white and soft hands. I loved it. After that I started hooking up and dating guys. But, I never felt the same way as I did with him. And sometimes, when I am alone at home, at night... I get spooked... thinking he might be... ...dead. Do you want me to ask him to go on all fours for you, so you can use him as a chair? He's very obedient. No, thanks. Or to massage your feet? Hello, do you have a book called "How to find your perfect partner"? Or "How to find happiness with your partner," or something like that? I don't think anything has been written on that subject. Are you sure? It's from the doctor who talks on TV. "Find an imperfect partner and be happy". I have it here, if you follow me, I'll show you. Sandra, will you take care of closing, since I did it yesterday? Yes. Sure, go. Get rest. Gloria. I want to talk to you. My working hours are done, so, if you want to talk about work... ... you're going to have to wait until tomorrow. Gloria! Are you OK? What are you doing here? You crossed on a red light, are you out of your mind? Yes, I think so. Two hot chocolates, please. No, I'm getting an Scotch without ice. Trust me, the hot chocolate here is amazing. You're not my boss here,I'm not drinking what you think is best... ...I'm getting whatever I want. I don't know if you remember, but I just saved your life a few minutes ago. Humor me, and we're even. It's been years since I last had hot chocolate. I insisted only because... it's good for the soul... And it seemed to me that... Since I wanted to talk to you outside of work... It seemed to me that it could help us to... to open the doors. I wanted to talk to you because... I'm worried about you. If you want to fire me, you don't have to beat around the bush, no need. I don't care, really. Besides, I want to travel, I could use the extra money. I wasn't thinking about firing you, you're our best employee. But, I don't want to talk about work, I want to talk about you. You don't seem well. Why are you talking about traveling? Actually, I'm not sure I want to travel. I wanna go to a place with no people around. Perhaps, I should move out to the countryside. - I don't think you'd last long. - What would you know? Because you are a soul bookseller. Is what you do best. I don't think you could place a library in the middle of nowhere. You know what it is Books, they've ruined my life. I don't believe you. I think they're what you love the most. I grew up reading the best authors. My first friends were the most brilliant people in the history of the world. And after them, I never found real people who lived up to that. Lived up to who, for example? I don't know... Virginia Woolf for example. She was manic-depressive. Living with her would have been hell. Well, I don't know... Poe, Mailer... They were... Edgar Allan Poe? Really? He had severe bipolar disorder. He was found dead wrapped in clothes that didn't belong to him. Mailer almost killed his wife in a fit of rage. - Yeah, but that's not what I mean. - What do you mean? Guys like Hemingway... Narcissistic and alcoholic, ended up as a schizophrenic. Yes, he was nuts... Bad example. But... I was reading Celine and then it was time to go to school... - Celine collaborated with the Nazi's. - Enough. That is not the point I want to make. What I want to say is that I was a teenager and I read Flaubert. What could I talk about with my classmates that could match that depth? Flaubert paid for teenagers to have sex with him. If he had been in your class, you would have thought he was a lewd pig. And besides, he was probably not very outgoing, you wouldn't have even met him. I'm not sure of that. You never talked to any of them. I don't know... All I know is I want to go away and I need a place where I can rest in peace. The dead rest in peace. I think what you actually need is living. What I don't understand is why were you in the middle of the street. If I tell you, you wouldn't believe me. And what were you doing there? Were you following me? Me? Didn't you live somewhere else? I left the apartment I was in and returned to mine. You own a place? That's great. Yes, it is... This is it. Wanna come up for a bit to...? ... see the place? Yeah... If you think its alright. - Bye, good night. - Bye. Good night. And this is the bedroom, it's kind of messy, I apologize. It's a small apartment but it's cozy. Is lovely So, if you leave, what are you gonna do with it? I don't know what's best, actually. Maybe I'll sell the place. So I can have some backup, travel to more places, stay wherever I want. But, I don't know... Don't leave. Who asks this of me? The killjoy from the bookstore or the guy from the coffee shop who cares about me? Someone else you don't know yet. Who is that other person? He is selfish. - Selfish? - Yes. Because he only thinks about how this will affect him. And if you leave, he's gonna miss you. I'm sorry... I can't. Sandro, wake up. Someone is breaking in next door. Why did you leave me? Attention crew cabin, prepare for landing. Miss, Miss... I have everything. People of all races, all social classes... Jews, Catholics, protestants, Lutherans, Buddhists, Muslims... - For you, I have a couple who... - Excuse me, where am I? I have a couple who have just decided, very stable people... nice people... Dante! Miss, listen to me. Very stable people. look at them. Good financial position... Dante! What are you doing here? I don't know! This is amazing, I didn't die. Impossible, the only way to get here is to die. So... Life does goes on, it's wonderful. Not life. This is death. How did you get here? I just couldn't stand it. After you left, nothing made sense anymore. Did you come here for me? How does this work? What happens now? Well... Basically, one chooses where to go next. From whatever's available, that is... You can choose a life and start over. But can you choose any place in the world? I don't know about choosing the place, but sure, why do you ask? Because we can choose the life that we want. Together. Wouldn't you like it? Of course! That would be wonderful. We could live in a remote country, in the countryside, and raise our children close to nature... And send them to a farm school and grow our own food. We would spend all our time together. What I had in mind was different. Different how? Well, actually, the time I spent with you... great times. ...was while I was waiting for something for me. Something for you? It's not easy to find what you are looking for. It's not easy in life and it's not easy here. It's not about saying, "I want this life" and that's it. You have to know your way around these things. In theory, this should be random, but there are ways... not entirely legit ways. But everyone uses them. Just chill. There are "agents". Agents? They're like real estate or travel agencies that help you get what you want. But it takes its time. That's why we had so much time together. I told them what I was interested in and they said they would call me with options. And, well, this is what I picked. This is their file. It's a proper family, see? They live in a good area, close to everything, they are well off. They are also well connected, you know, for getting a good job and all that... I would like to work in business. So I could send my children to a good school... So they can have classy friends... I mean, a proper life. - But, these people are dead inside... - No, we are the dead ones. But look at these pictures. They're totally shallow. All that's missing is an oversize SUV and a a book by Paulo Coelho. If you read the file, you'll see he has a SUV. And she has a Cherokee that is perfect for taking me and my brothers to school. You think this is the way life should be? You wouldn't live with us. If you live in the area, we'll get a chance to meet. Plus, what's around us isn't important. Do you remember what we were like together? - How we were in bed? - Yes... that's my point. Let's go somewhere quiet, just us. You and me, nothing else. That's impossible, we need to be born from someone. - Excuse me, are you Dante? - Yes. Sorry, I have to go. Find something close by. Same area or same school. If they make you wait, it's fine. A year or two won't make a difference. Five, four... Make sure you get the last name right. It's hyphenated, and you might get confused. It is now. Bye. Get it all out, come on! Dear God! Please! Why would you do such a thing? What were you thinking? Gustavo. I need to talk to you. Now? No, if you don't mind, I'd like to go somewhere else. I've never seen you without gel. It looks way better. I thought the location was wrong, is this a joke? No! Come on, let's have some fun! - Where did you bring me? - You never came here? - Never - Well... me neither. I can't believe it. The way you got scared with that creepy doll... It jumped at me. I thought it was over and... It jumped right at me. How did you come up with this? Sandra says that in a first date,you need to do something with adrenaline... Because it's get you in a mood to be with someone. Nonsense she sees online. Oh, is this a date? You know this is not appropriate. But it's Ok. for you to go up to my apartment, throw yourself at me and kiss me... I wanted to talk to you about that, I apologize. No, it was ok. You didn't do anything wrong. I even felt bad that I made you go upstairs and then... At that time, I had my head elsewhere and... It's okay. I get it. We all have our ghosts. Why did you say that? I mean, we all have unresolved issues. It is normal. Yeah, well. I just wanted to talk to you about it. Because I want to leave my ghosts behind. Or rather my ghost, because he was one in particular... - You don't need to explain that... - Well I do... Because... I liked it. What did you like? The kiss. When you kissed me, I mean. And why did you reject me then? I was afraid. Of what? The feeling of wanting to be with an annoying guy like you. Gloria... I think I realize what you're trying to do. I am not an easy person. I know. But I am not afraid anymore. What happened? If I kiss you now, this has no turning back. And what's the problem with that? - That it's against the rules. - What about last time? It was different... You said you were going to go away I was afraid of losing you. So now that I am actually here you start getting all hysterical? No. How is it possible for me not to find any living man? Do I have to steal a creepy doll from this place and take it to my bed? I'm just saying that we don't need to be so impulsive. We can take things easy and reflect and do things... properly. Why do you care so much about the rules? What do you want to wait for? - We are not in this world forever. - Let's not get dramatic either. I don't care about the rules. I don't give a damn about them. But I do care about the fact that someone trusts me to enforce them. And I don't think we have to go around betraying this trust. And I don't understand why we have to risk everything today. What risks are you talking about? if I kiss you now, I'm going to keep doing it until we get to bed. And in there... You and I... Are going to have sex. That's a logical deduction. What's wrong with it? You know what it's like... At a first encounter, if things are going well, it's great. If things go more or less, you keep on trying. But if things go wrong... it is the end. That's it. You're afraid. Yes.... Yes. For a long time, even years, I see you everyday wandering among the bookshelves... With a bad slept face. But, being infinitely patient with the most unbearable customers. With such humility, despite everything you know. Doing your job and also Sandra's, with absolute dedication. Your love for books, your curiosity, your interests in new things... You are the soul of that library, you know? And you are so... Without noticing that I am there. Because the guy you see everyday, isn't me. And yes, I think that... I am afraid that some of that will change. I'm just asking you to take it easy. We have time. Look... As I've said before... I am no longer afraid. And I don't want fear to make decisions for me. So I was wrong about you. Or perhaps we are in different moments. Gloria! Gustavo! You almost died. Let's not waste any more time. Do you have any books autographed by Onetti? No, we have several of his books, including some first editions... But none of them are autographed, unfortunately. Oh, It's my wife's birthday and she would love that so much... Would you forge his signature for me? Well... let's see... Hello, do you have a summary of The Bible? Yes, old or new testament? If the new one has come out, I'll take that one, it must be better, right? Hello, what can I do for you? I'm looking for a book for my son, he is seven years old. Ah, look, I just have this one here. - It's about... - It doesn't matter, I'll take it. THE MOTHER... ...OF THE FUTURE. SOMETHING ABOUT MY MOTHER. MOTHER OF THE TREES. Hi. Find out if I can get a job at your place, 'cause this time, your assface friend will kick me out. He's not as bad as you think, he has a noble side. Antique photographs, developed like in the old days! You should see the new employee. He is hot and we really get along. - Yeah? Is he good in bed? - I don't know. I haven't fucked him yet. We have this thing going on... I want to enjoy it a little longer. It's healthy to try new ways, sometimes. However, we're meeting later. So, maybe I'll end up trying the whole thing. Or not. I don't know. We'll see. Well, whatever happens, good luck. Pray that Assface doesn't find out, I mean... Gustavo. Bye. You open earlier and close later than us. Have some consideration for your competitors. I stick to the opening hours set by my employer, that's all. "I stick to the opening hours set by my employer". That's why I don't have a boss, see? - How did you do today? - Good, you? Good... The new employee is getting on my nerves, he's terrible. Besides, I think he's flirting with your friend, I'm going to have to let him go. Give him time, it's not an easy job to learn. You can't start a new job by hitting on one of your co-workers. Maybe they'll just go out a couple of times and then it will just fade away. And if they get serious, surely, one of them will leave. That's not what the rules say, and it is my job to enforce them. She's my friend, don't do it for her, do it for me. Show me that I have some kind of influence on you. Do you know what day it is today? Monday. Today, one year ago, we moved in together. One year already...? Yes, believe it, you do have an influence. Will you let them get to know each other? I'll give them a week. One week? Give them a month. They're getting to know each other. Let's make it twelve months... Hi. Do you know where the Solis Theater is? Yes. We never come into the city, we thought we knew our way around... But we've just been going round in circles... Can't seem to find the place. - Yes, see, the Solis is there... - That little thing there? We passed by it a thousand times, I thought it would have a much bigger. Great, thank you. Go ahead. Hey, what happened? What if we had a baby? They say when you have a child you never get a good night's sleep again. I've had enough sleep, you? Me too. Good, 'cause I think I'm pregnant. Antique photographs. Developed like in the old days. Here is the information to get it. Thank you. Someday you'll see... That I'm going to die... Loving you, loving you, loving you. Someday you'll know... What it's been like to live... Loving you, loving you, loving you. And so she told me... "Don't fall in love with anyone". "Don't fall in love with anyone", she said. "Don't fall in love with anyone". I have the perfect couple for you. Let's see. Good people, hardworking, they are booksellers. They have their own business. They have never had a child before, they just made the decision... And I'm showing them to you first. Look.
