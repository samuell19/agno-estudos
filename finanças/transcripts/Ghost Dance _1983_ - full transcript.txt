When two people have intercourse, there are always four people watching. For it is at moments of great intimacy and vulnerability that the internalized figures from the past become present. But these four ghosts bring along their internalized ghosts. And so on, and so on. And this is how the generations, going back to the seashore, and perhaps before, make their presence known beside us. Long before memory, in a past without form, they began to appear, in the darkness of the night. Then as memory began to screen them out, they slipped into language, hiding between letters, and jumping out between words. Fuck you. I'm sick of it. I'm selling everything. I'm off. Don't try to find me, As far as I'm concerned, you're a ghost. In an age of darkness, long ago and far away, during periods of mourning, the living would attack the dead, throwing stones at them, hurling abuse at them, spitting and screaming with rage. For they felt they'd been abandoned to the terrors of the night. Why can't I forget? It's as if I were responsible. Why do I wake up so often in the night with the feeling that they're watching me? Shit, I'm so scared. They're all out there, talking about me. God I need some silence. At first, it was thought that ghosts would be forgotten in this new electronic age, but as things turned out, they began to use electronic gadgets for their own purpose. Now they often jump on radio waves. There are many recorded cases of ghosts appearing in electrical shops. How much for this stuff? You must be joking. Only nutcases can buy that stuff. It isn't worth anything. You must be crazy. It's new and I bought it here. Well, that stuff's worth something only on the point when it passes from me to you. Before that it's ' liability. After that it's ' useless. Look, sweetheart. I'll show you what this is worth. Now beat it before I lose my customers. Hey, Pascal! Where have you been hiding yourself? You know it's been six months since our last tutorial. I've tried ringing your place a number of times and all I get are... crazy messages on your answering machine. I moved lots of times since then. But it was my voice on the machine. Didn't you recognize it? No. It was like a ghost in the machine. I worked on it. The idea. And I saw Jaq Derrida the other day. And he gave me some suggestions... So I wanted to get in touch with you about this this week anyways. Yeah sure, Pascal. Whenever I bump into you, it's always by chance. I can't go there all the time. I can't stand sitting in that place. - It's full of creeps down there. -So I'm just another creep, huh? No, not you! I'll tell you something. Even when I'm not there, I get someone to tape it for me, so I can listen to it over and over again. And I do. Pascal, you sure have some imagination. I like juxtapositions. So I like to play it any place, like, in bars, in the bath, in subways, and you should be pleased, because I've made you a kind of god. You're in all places at all times. So it would appear that I am to play the master, with Pascal as my disciple. Through the technology on her Sony Walkman, she is to feel the presence. The power relation of master-disciple is now going to be reified, anesthetized. Fuck you. I'm sick of it. I'm off. I'm heading for adventure. A voice in a recorder. Could it simply be that of a ghost in a machine? If this is the case then... sur d'image. Look Pascal, since you know Derrida, why don't you come along with me? I think I've got to sell this lot first, so maybe I can't. Look, since I've got you here, now, come on, let's go. You both know each other? You know, Pascal is my problem student. She says I'm a creep, never attends my lectures, but I always listen to her intriguing ideas. -Really? - Pleased to meet you Pascal. - Me too, thanks. - We've never met. - No, but it feels like I've know you for years. Perhaps you could talk to her about some of her ideas. I dreamt that I was talking to myself. Then something happened, and 'I' and 'me' became different people. We were walking through a city. Night was falling, and the sky was becoming radiant with electric lights. We started to walk towards the ocean. Suddenly people were rushing in the opposite direction. There was terrible panic. The people that were rushing toward us were the dead of centuries that had gone before. Their crushing weight turned into a tidal wave. It hit us, and only one of us survived. She met him many times. She asked him about Kafka, Heidegger, Marx, and Freud. When she left, she was never sure who she had been speaking to. She was left with an afterimage, that seemed to be drawing her own phantoms out of herself. There will be a small seminar, tomorrow afternoon. It's a closed seminar, but you can come if you want. Four and fifteen' fifteen past four PM. And there will be another seminar on Wednesday. Next Wednesday at 5PM. I'll be very glad to meet you. Goodbye. You're crazy to be so concerned with this ritual of yours. During the war, when the Russians asked for his body, they used to say they could have his body, but they'd have to leave his ideas here. Did you know that originally it was buried in another part of the cemetery, almost a pauper's grave. I just hope they got the right bones, not that it matters. History's gone, it can never be relived. History's just a point of view, like anything else. It changes according to where you happen to be standing. I was walking through a desert when I came across the ruins of an ancient seaport. But the sea had dried up many centuries before. At first I could see myself clearly, as if I was standing in front of a mirror. Then I vanished, and all I could see was the grey-black sand which was beginning to cover everything. Then the voices started. At first they seemed like the insects that were crawling in the sand. Then they seemed to be coming from me. They were living inside me, but they were watching me at the same time. Then they took me out of myself and I could see myself clearly, walking away on the horizon. She thought of herself as 'I', but the more she encountered the decay around her, the more she moved into a gap between 'I' and 'me'. For it's well known that social decay induces psychic fragmentation. The more things break up, the more myths flourish, attempting to make historical sense out of historical chaos. She began to feel the presence of so many of these inside her, as if they were clawing away at her flesh from the inside. Look at her. She thinks she's different from the rest of us. She thinks she's got immunity. But when they come here, they won't make any exception for her. Masura was an extraordinary woman. I met her on a film set when she was advising on native costume, on a film about cargo cults of the Far East. She was able to move with ease between two completely different cultures, as if part of her was at home in the rich world, and part of her was at home in the poor. She told me about a village by a river that had been periodically invaded by an army of rats. The villagers were afraid of them, but they also worshiped them. I wouldn't close my eyes if I was her. They can still see you, even if you can't see them. Trying to pretend they're not there won't help her. They believed the rats embodied the ghosts of their ancestors. By their speed and guile, they had been able to run through time to visit their women. Years before, when their land and wealth had been taken from them, a strange event had taken place there. You cannot sleep forever. Even though to wake is to fall, it's better to fall once and get it over with than to stay fast asleep forever. You're on the point of waking; you're standing on the edge of a division that may never be healed. To fall is to pass between. To fall is to touch, but never make contact. To fall is to fail and succeed at the same time. To fall is to enter a darkness, darker than all the places in your dreams, but to fall is to be real, for a moment, forever. One night, the rats had eaten the woman who was lying asleep by the river They had ripped off her clothes, and by the time she'd woke up, it was too late. They had entered her body by every possible opening. She began to shout and scream, but the voices that came out of her were the voices of the dead. To be inside and outside at the same time. The one who sees, and the one who is seen. To enter the place, where space becomes time, and time stops still. To escape from time, forever. All rituals are an expression of this wish. But it's a wish you can't succumb to. For if you don't wake soon, all your choices will diminish, and you'll return to the place you came from, without even a moment of knowing. She began to shout and scream, but the voices that came out of her were the voices of the dead. The rats ate all her flesh from the inside, until all that was left was a clean white skeleton. Then the dogs came out and ripped the bones apart, but the rats returned and set upon the dogs, leaving nothing of them remaining except their tails. Suddenly, a big black bird flew out of the sky. Who gives a fuck how big it is? The bird swooped down, and ate up all the rats. Then the bird changed, and assumed the form of two women, both of whom were beautiful. And when they were together, they had magical powers. They told the villagers that the new era was to begin, when they would be joined by all their ancestors. But some of the villagers, who had committed crimes and bad deeds with the wives of the dead were so afraid of their return, That they tricked the women to go down to the sea, where a great wave took them away. She told me myths have the same qualities as radio waves. When they arrive in a village, they seem to have come from nowhere. That's why, so often, they are credited with supernatural origin. Masura told me not to scoff at her story, for it contained more truth than might at first appear. For things are not always what they seem. They also have an inner life of their own. What's it like over there? - The same as here, really. - But is it easier to sleep, and easier to wake? Depends how much rage you can get rid of in your love-making. How much you feel cared for, and how much you care. I know what you mean, but it sounds better with a French accent. Try this with a French accent: how will we get some fucking money? - Get it like the others get it. Nick it, swipe it, win it, con it. - Have you ever worked? - Yeah. Yeah, for a while I worked in this big company that dealt in money. So why didn't you take some while you were on the inside? I never saw any of the actual money. Only the fat bastards who eat it. And they do eat it, so it doesn't get stolen from them. They store it in their bellies 'til it converts to money turds. Then they shit it out, straight into the bank. What were you doing over there? - What did you learn about? -Rituals, cults. Magical beliefs of the primitives. The usual rubbish. But I studied the cargo cults of the Far East, and I wanted to go there. 'cause they still exist now. - Why give it up? I used to love my teacher. He was so wise. But then, one day, I caught him staring at a picture of a naked Indian woman in a book called' and I laughed. Since then, he ignored me, and he gave me low marks. What a mean bastard. Okay, I made up the last bit. Anyway, maybe I'll tell you later what really happened, if I learn to trust you. Do you know why they put that D on the building over there? D stands for Desire. D stands for Death. - D for Dynamite. - D for Despair. - D for Drugs, Dice, and Dollars. - D for Darkness, D for Deafness. - D for Destruction. - D for Dole and Depression. - D for Derrida. - D for Desire. Shit George, you're driving me crazy. - How do you find the room? - The room is fine, thanks. - Sleep okay? - Yeah. But I had a strange dream. I dreamt that I was being chased by a gang, or that I might have been part of a gang chasing someone else - It was very frightening. - Perhaps the room's still a bit damp. No. I often dream things like this anyway. The room is fine. What's that noise? That's George. He stays here sometimes. He's obsessed with drums. It was his idea to take this flat above the drum shop. Alright, that is enough. For Christ's sake, George, will you turn that fucking bloody weather forecast off? Alright, sweetheart, I'm going out. I'll leave you in peace, okay? Sorry about that. He has a thing about the weather forecast. He listens to the long range, the local forecast, the worldwide, the shipping. Reads books on it, studies maps on it, and makes up drum rhythms to accompany the forecasts on the radio. He's a fucking nutcase. If you stick around, no doubt you'll hear more about it. - Can I take a shower? - Yeah, sure. We just had the hot water turned on. Landlord thinks it'll get him more rent. Bastard... You know, when you arrived last night, I thought I'd seen you somewhere before. You remind me of a girl who took my photo by the wall of the communards in Paris. - You ever been there, in Pere Lachaise? - I went there often. But I don't remember if it was me. It would be a strange coincidence. I'd like to believe it. Is this where it happened? Suddenly it doesn't seem that long ago. Would you take my picture, standing by the wall? Don't move. Pardon, mademoiselle, I have to speak to these American folks. Thank you. La Commune was the first proletarian revolution. Le Communard fought with great bravery, in the streets of Paris, from behind the barricades. They fought down to the last one. - Women, children and men alike. - Shit! The bourgeois soldiers took no prisoners. Every sympathizer was shot. The last battle of the commune took place in this cemetery. - They fought from grave to grave. - No shit! At the end of the battle, the bourgeois soldiers lined up the 251 survivors against this wall. The communard all died with extreme courage, with one shout: vive la commune! Gee, is that where the word 'commie' comes from? When the first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, went into space, he took two things with him: a picture of Lenin, and a piece of the communard flag. - The Americans were the first ones in space. - So, in spite of these errors, they could not kill the idea. The idea lives on, like ideas often do. No one can kill an idea. Ideas have wings, and can fly through eternal space. So was that you? No, it was not me. No, when I think about it now, she was much older than you then, and that was a couple of years ago. You studied anthropology, is that why you put that photo up about cargo cults? Yeah, I studied anthropology, but now, strictly speaking, I am a student of ghosts. I studied with Jaq Derrida once. He told me a lot, about ghosts. But he couldn't teach me everything, 'cause there are things that a man can't teach to a woman, right? Why did you come to London? I came to London because I wanted to study the third world. So I chose London. You think we're more primitive? Or did you just come hoping to see some riots? - No, I came because of the music. - Well that's a myth in itself. I suppose all cities generate their own myths. London, the music' Paris, the barricades. Do you think these myths are attempts to avoid something? Well, I just think that now, things are starting to break up, and people will start to believe in anything. - Do you wanna take your shower? - Yeah. So I'll see you in a minute, okay? That one must think she has the power to call up the rats from the sewer. That she's got something they want, something special inside her. Well, she's wrong. She's empty, just a shell like everybody else. There's a rat in here! A rat in here! He's moving. There, under the towel! How can it be, that in this age of electric buildings, crude beliefs of the middle ages are poking their heads out of the gutters of time? Up to thirty inches long and six inches in diameter, with a knob at the end, used as a kind of vigilante battering ram of righteousness. This knob represented the end of a snake. In the central islands, some people had seen the snake, some people had seen the ancestors' from the belly of a giant bird' In one area, there was a snake cult, where men carried a large poll with a knob on the end which represented the head of a snake. When it was carried on their shoulders, the men merely went where the snake took them. It was credited with great powers. It was also used to detect crimes, and it became a kind of battering ram of righteousness. 'was possibly inspired in part by the old Bigonna python cults to the north which also had this sin-discovering battering ram' ...I don't understand a fucking... seems ok. She says she didn't put it in her mouth. But I know she did. And when it was as far as it would go, she started to suck and suck, but when it remained dry, she bit as hard as she could. That's how she swallowed it! And that's why she's always hungry, because the bit she swallowed ate every- thing else inside her to get its own back so there she is, empty and so hateful, waiting for the revenge that she knows is going to come. She's had it. I think there's a cold front coming over. She's going fucking nuts again. What's happening in there? Not another typewriter, Pascal, please. - I'm sick of it. I don't know what the fuck I'm trying to say. I can't write a thing. I'm going around in circles. - Why don't you come in here and listen to some music? - George, you'll dance for us. - Okay, if it'll warm things up. What are you writing about anyway, that's so important? I thought you'd given all that up, for adventure. I have, almost. I was trying to write about something I saw the other day nearby the canal. It really frightened me. I saw some children playing a game that resembled the elements of a snake cult I once read about... Have you ever been to the canal? It wind through the city like a giant snake. I'll show you how to dance like a snake. What happened, by the canal? Well, I was walking near the canal, when suddenly' And suddenly, I had this strong urge to put it in my mouth. But I didn't' So I didn't. Could you make me a copy of this stuff, please? What kind of stuff is it? It's a thesis. Why do you need to know? I just want a copy. I don't want your life history, darling, I just want to know what kind of paper it is, right? I wonder if he'll be angry. Oh shit, which word was it? How could you not tell me there's different kinds of paper in it? Now I'm gonna have to examine each one individually. Which I'm not paid for, by the way, I just get paid to press the buttons. Oh no, fuck, he's reading it. No wonder it got jammed with this stuff in it. Thought you said this was a thesis. It is, but I need to write as word comes. Seems like pretty heavy stuff to me. I'll run myself off a copy to read later. Must be a rightnutcase to write this stuff. Hey Jim, you seen this? Told you. Always gets jammed with filth in it. Same every time. Listen, you fucking voyeur. You pass me my stuff, and I'll leave you with your fantasies. Listen, pisshead. If you're looking for a fight you've come to the right place. First you come in with all that filth, then you start mouthing off like you know something about something. Why don't you just get your thesis and stick it up your bum? When two people have intercourse, there is always one other present. But this other takes on a form that cannot be described. It is the trauma itself. The witness. Why do you always carry so much junk about with you? You never read when you're out anyway. It means, it's in case I get stuck to something to think about... yeah. You think too much! Let's get on the boat. I'm not dawdling about for George. It is between, and it is excluded. A noise that breaks the enigma of the night. A mirror that refuses to confirm existence. And encounter with a form of sexuality that signifies death. I know what the Paris commune is about, but what about the ghost story? It's about the origin of religion, magical ways of thinking, conversations, it's about cults and rituals. And what about the story of age? It's not for you. I'm afraid you're not old enough. You'd better tell me, or I'll chuck you in. Try this to see what happens. It's very sexual. It's about a perversion. What's the difference between a cult and a perversion? I don't know what the difference is. But I know they've got the same feeling, in some strange way. You know, when I read something erotic, and when I read then at my... anthropology work, I really feel I'm there. What happens? But it's more interesting than that, though. Well, what happens? Everything! Is the women who tells the story the one who plays the part? That's her. Is that the man on the back of the book, and is that the woman on the front, with only the text between them? Is it about rising above excitement and falling beneath despair? Is it about a condition beyond agony, where they've abandoned themselves completely? Do they fuck in silence, or do they hide themselves in noise? Both. Do their strange sexual actions have the feel of a primitive ritual? Are there ten men watching what's happening, and are there ten women watching them? Does she like it and hate it at the same time, and does he hate it and like it? Always. Do they continue until they're beyond exhaustion? Does she pretend to look at him with tenderness? Does he degrade her without compassion? Of course! Tell me, does she enjoy it all in a real sort of a way? - Shut up, you fool! - Well excuse me for having a hard on! Go over there and play with your fucking weather forecast, we don't need your comments. - Fuck off, you perverts. Do they mark her skin? And do the marks on her skin feel like her real self being freed from the encapsulation of her body? Do they brand her initials onto her skin, and does she come with each letter, and twice with each word? Do they pay her for giving herself to them? No, they don't pay her. They don't know how much to pay such a perfect image of themselves. That's why, in some ways, she triumphs over them, for they became the victims of their own victim. But there's one thing I left out. She couldn't see any of this, for she's completely blind, and the thing they fear most is that she could see in spite of her blindness. - Oh, god. - George, cut the fuck off and leave us in peace. Go out and get us some money, and you can take that thing with you. Screw you two, I'm going into town. I need a long walk to cool down. I don't blame him for being pissed off. Sure. It's his own fault. He always wants to hang around. His trouble is he doesn't know who he is. Fuck, what a shit I am. Too broke to buy and too scared to steal. Fucking hell, they're right. I am such an ugly fucker. Not ugly in a strong way, just' a weakling. I'd like to change my bone structure but there's nothing I can do about that. I wish I could change my skin but' that would be too expensive. It's the way I move that betrays me most. I walk like a turd. If I wasn't so tense all the time, I probably wouldn't act like a court-fucking-jester. God I need a screw. What the fuck am I going to do? Fuck it, I'll buy a suit. That'll show them who's a castrato. Pissheads. Look at that filthy animal trying to scratch himself clean. No amount of scratching can take his scurvy away. How can anyone think of touching him? She was right not to touch him. But she's worse in many ways. She's falling apart before his eyes but he can't see it. They're both in decay because they're killing each other. They can't change it now. Not once the process has begun. Quick, let's move. The ritual began when the women told each other stories about the sexual prowess of their ancestors. They were supposed to believe that they were alone. But all the time they were being over- heard by a man dressed up as a wild pig. Fuck, someone's on the crossing. So, you like driving my car, do you? On realizing they had been overheard, they tried to send the man away, but he returned dressed up as a jaguar. Then in order to keep their secrets, they played a trick on him. They said, 'Jaguar, are you really one of the ancestors? Tell us how it was then, when you got up to your games with the women.' The jaguar said he's show them, and they encouraged him to begin. But when he was off-guard, one of them killed him. The jaguar then turned in a man again, But couldn't remember any of the conversation that had taken place between the women. Now I'm going to act something out here. I've been planning this for some time. You wanted a play? Well, now you've got two parts in my play. You know what's gonna happen, don't you? We're gonna watch ourselves in the mirror and you and gonna watch us watching ourselves in the mirror. - No, not that, not that. - And we're gonna watch you, watching us, watching ourselves. You killed him. He's dead, isn't he? He's dead... Wonder if there's anything here worth nicking. How can you talk about thing like this after what happened? What else is there to talk about? I've forgotten everything that happened here already. Anyway, how could it have happened? It doesn't make sense. Well, I suppose that's true. It doesn't seem possible. The only thing I can't forget is the smell. It'll be here for days, we'd better wash it off. I've got an idea about the smell... Smells like summertime. I wish it was summer now. Sea of electric eels. Sea of unknown movements, far below the surface. Sea of primitive desires. Sea of endless triangles. Sea of ritualistic murder. Sea of history. Sea of greed. Sea of guilt. Sea of eight million false faces. Sea of lost hopes. Sea of despair. Sea of occasional reason. Sea without time. Do I have any choice but to suffer my own history? It feels like some mysterious figure is directing everything I do. Someone who hasn't been present for a very long time. They're coming closer. I've been expecting them. They really don't know what's happening. They don't know the end. There's not much time left. The wish to stop time is a deathly wish. They're going to see an image of their own struggle with their own persona. They'll be left with that. I'll leave them that, at least. Wait. I don't like it. There are ghosts aroung here. There is no ghosts around here. I know where they are, anyway. Come on. Beyond the mask of intellect. Beyond the reaches of consciousness. A nothing. A no-thing. A nowhere. Subtitles: kikil@kg.
