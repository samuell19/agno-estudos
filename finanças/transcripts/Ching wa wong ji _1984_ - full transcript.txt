Walking down the street hand in hand Shy and embarrassed We wanted to have dim sum But the line is too long Enjoying the countryside The beautiful view by the sea Enjoying the local flavor Except for the stinking shrimp paste Swinging in the park But the kids are a pain They keep staring I had to curse them Where can we go? A quiet place is rare I see the frogs in the pond They don't have a care I wish I can be like them Enjoying the greenery by the pond Hand in hand!
