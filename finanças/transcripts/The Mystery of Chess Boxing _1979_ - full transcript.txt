(dramatic music) (grunting) - Chao Yun-Lung, how are you? (laughs) - Huh? Ghost Faced Killer! Sumei! - Dad! - Sumei, go on! Hurry! (grunting) - I warn you. You have no chance. You recognize this technique? - Huh? The Five Elements! - You remember! (grunting) I guess you thought that you'd escape. But I shall get all of you! - But why though? (grunting) (laughs) (dramatic music) - Yun-Lung! - Dad! - Yun-Lung! (dramatic music) - Shie Wei Meng? - Huh? (tin sound) (grunting) You my friend will die today. You will use the Lotus! - Five Elements! - That's right! (grunting continues) (whiplash) (upbeat gong music) - Granddad, a castle move to pawn four. - Knight pawn three. (relaxing music) - He's moved his knight. Check on Queen two. - Pawn forward two. - Pawn forward two. - Knight to Pawn four. (relaxing music) - Hey, that's the one. See it? That's the move! - Think so? - No problem. (relaxing music) - That one? - Yes, of course! (scoffs) (laughs) - Granddad, a Bishop move. Back Queen three. - Rook forward one. (laughs) (relaxing music continues) (wood slamming) - Damnit! That's your fault! - It's all right, go on again! - Play again? Damnit! You interfered! - Didn't mean to. I'm on my way to school to study Kung Fu. - Hold it. - Kid? Where are you going? Tell me. - What? You curious? - (snickers) Well now I guess so. Well? - Chang Sing School. - Oh. (laughs) That so? And why are you going there? Tell me. - Study. - Oh? I think that they won't accept you there. - Why not? - I'll tell you why. I'm a senior student there. (dramatic music) (laughs) - I think that you're lying, that's what. (grunting) - Granddad! - Right. I'll have to show you just how well a senior student can fight! (grunting continues) - He's got a good body there. - Granddad, please stop them or he'll be killed! - He'll survive. - Kid! Get this thing off! (grunts) Goddamn! I said, get this thing off! - Ow! (grunting continues) - Granddad! - I'm gonna kill you now! - Please spare his life. Let him go. - Let him go? - All right. Will you? - All right! Kid, I won't kill you but I won't forgive you until you've kowtowed to me. - Kowtow to him? Hey, mister, do I have to kowtow to him? - Depends if you want to learn. (calm music) - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three. (knocking on door) (door creaks) - What do you want? - One, two, three. - Hey! Come back here! Come back! - What is it? What's wrong? Oh, you again! - Brother, we did try to stop him but he just broke in! - And so what? I just want to join the school. You see me? I kowtowed all the way! - Oh, right! You've apologized. Hey, let him go. Go on. - Yes, sir! (laughs) - Easy, easy. Listen to me. You told me you want to learn, study Kung Fu! You apologized. But there's a few formalities, do you know that? The first one. - Hey, brother, just tell me I'll do it. - (laughs) Right. Well the first thing to do, hey, is to ask you to demonstrate your skill here. - Right. Watch. (relaxing music) Well? - It's hopeless! Lalu? - Yes? (whiplash) - Hey, is that sword real? - It's real! (grunting) (dramatic music) - Damnit! Get him! (grunting continues) (upbeat dramatic music) - Hey, that's enough! Hey, you be careful! That sword! You can kill me with it! (upbeat dramatic music) (grunting continues) - Hey! What are you doing? - Hey, take the sword back! - Get him! Get him! - Take it back! Here take it back! - What is this? Go on. Get him! (grunting continues) Hey stop it! Stop it! It's me! (grunting continues) - Oh my God! Ow! Brother, please stop. - You can't take it, huh? - Too much. It's too much! - Too much? You're soft! - No, please, stop it! - What? (grunts) - Please, broher! - Can't even stand this? You're useless! There's more. - More? But-- (dramatic music) - Enough! I declare I'd take him as my pupil! - [All] Teacher! (dramatic music) - Teacher! (upbeat exciting music) (laughs) (upbeat exciting music) - Get up. - Sure. - Get up! You know our rules, huh? Any newcomers must fetch the rice for the seniors. - If that's the rules. - Go on! - Sure. - I'd tell you, in fact, there's three rules. First fetch the rice. - For everyone? - Hey! Second. Silence. - Silence? I see. (calm music) - Hey! The third rule is don't break the bowls. - Don't break the bowls? - Yeah. (laughs) - Oh, silence, silence. God, I'm a real loose. - Of course! You're new in the school and schools have rules. All right? - Sure. (upbeat music) (calm music) (snickers) - Ah Pao! More rice! Come on! (calm music) - Ah Pao. - Huh? - Ah Pao. - Ah Pao. (calm music) - Ah Pao. - Huh? - Bring rice! (calm music) - Hey wait! You'll have to be much more courteous! You keep the bowl level. You see? Just like that. (laughs) Got it? - Yeah, got it. Got it. (calm music) (enchanting music) - Kid, what is this? - I'm sorry, but I'm hungry. - Hungry? Too bad. If a man's hungry he has to steal! You're hungry? Want food? All right, I'm gonna eat my rice. You steal one grain you've won. You can come and eat here anytime. (exciting music) - That's not so good! (grunting) - (laughs) But that isn't rice. That's salt! (laughs) (gags) - Water! Water. - Stupid kid (laughs). - Ow! (grunting) - Hold on. Well, it's not so easy, huh? - No. I got it! - Kid, you're smart. Eat up! - Right! - Hey, kid, you may have studied at many schools, but however much you've learned I'm sure you have only just managed to get the basic essentials, and not very much more. You understand me? Kid, you're new here, huh? Eat up. - That iron lid weighs a ton. His Kung Fu must be good. - Teacher, I bow to you. - Hey, hold it, hold it, hold it. I'm just a cook. I'm no Kung Fu teacher. I could teach you cooking here, that's all (laughs). You better be more careful in the people you choose. Hey, come on, sit down, sit down. You eat up your food and you tell me why have you come here to study Kung Fu? - To get revenge. - Huh? (dramatic music) - Ghost Faced Killer! You're not dead? - I'm a killer, that's why. Killers don't die so easy, even though your so called loyal clans all got together and tried to kill me (snickers). Today you'll find out what death is like. You know my style. Five Elements. Which one do you think I'm gonna use? - The whole technique! (grunting) (whiplash) (calm music) (grunts) - Go on! - Teacher? - I told you many times but you won't believe me. What I teach you isn't good enough. And I am not your teacher. But if you call me teacher I'll send you away! - Sir! But if you do that where will I go? You must tell me. - Hey kid, don't talk garbage. When the time comes for you to go I'll tell you where to go all right. (indistinct chatter) - Hey look at that! (dramatic music) - Hey! Mister, want a game of chess? - A stupid game! Years ago I did know of one man who could play well. He was Chi Sue Tin. So they said. I never met him. But one of these days I will! - Granddad! Granddad? Granddad. - Please, sir, no trouble. We're poor simple folk just trying to make a living. But if you want a game of chess I'll be pleased to oblige you. - Well, I don't. Tell me, you, your name's Chi. Are you Chi Sue Tin? - I'm afraid I'm not. I mean I am not so lucky as to be well known. - I guess not. Chi Sue Tin was a man. (dramatic music) Yes. I guess that I was wrong. - Thank you. (grunts) - Granddad! - Get back! - Mister? - Grandad, why didn't you fight? - I don't want to start any trouble here. Get the things and let's close up now. (relaxing music) (screams) (laughing) - What's wrong? (laughing) As Pao bring some tea. My God! Some tea! - Sure! (relaxing music) (yawns) (relaxing music) (yawns) Brother, here. (yawns) - Ah Pao? You're tired now, go to bed. - Thanks, I will. (dramatic music) (screams) - Ah Pao! This is pee! Pee! (glass breaking) - Hey, who wants some rice now? - Ah Pao! You've forgotten the rules, huh? - Of course! - Silence! Silence. Ah Pao! Hurry! Ah Pao! You're getting good, huh? Right. Ah Pao! Ah Pao! - Ah Pao! (relaxing music) (glass breaking) - Watch me. (laughter) (applause) - Wonderful! (calm music) (laughs) - Think you're getting stronger? - Yeah. - Oh! (grunts) - All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Damn you! I'll kill you! Well you asked for it! You need a lesson! - Well, all right, go ahead then. I know, you're after me, don't want me. All right. I've had enough of all these games now. Wanna fight me? Well go ahead! - All right, I will! Get back! - Brother! (grunts) Relax! Tell me, what's this? - They're ones for ripping you up! - Listen. Don't seem to be working too well, does it? The mantis hook? The crab tail hook! (grunting continues) - What's in there? - Huh? Oh. (dramatic music) Very sorry. Your hook hit my iron plate. - Stand back! - Give it to me! - [All] Teacher! - Hey! - Ghost Faced Killing plate! So he is not dead then? - Teacher, he carries it around with him! - Kid, you look decent enough, so how could you then work for him? - Teacher? (grunting) Teacher! - Damn you! You dare to come to spy for him! - Teacher, I didn't! - No, then what's this? - I just keep it! - I know what it's for! - Teacher! - I'm not your teacher! You were sent to kill me! - Teacher? Teacher, you're wrong sir. - You'd never kill me! With your skill. Now get out! After today don't ever let me see your face again! - Teacher! (dramatic music) Teacher! - Ah Pao, get out! - Teacher! (grunts) (screams) (dramatic music) (laughs) (calm music) - Here chic, chic, chic, chic. Here chic, chic, chic. Here chic, chic, chic. Granddad! Granddad! Granddad! Granddad. - Who do you want? - You, sir. - And what for. - Oh, Yuan sent me here to study. - To study what? - Study Kung Fu. - Kung Fu? - Yeah. - Well, I could teach you chess with Kung Fu (laughs). - My last teacher was a cook. Now it seems my next one could only play chess. I know that maybe you're not really very good, just an amateur. Guess Yuen made a mistake. Can't be helped. - Granddad, come on. Uncle Yuen sent him here. See what he's got? That's a real heavy pot lid. I'll bet that he's really strong. - So you like him, huh? Kid, come here. - Ow! (grunting) (laughs) Like I said your Kung Fu probably isn't too good. Maybe the old man's good after all! Teacher! Teacher? (calm music) - Granddad. - Hmm? - How long must he kneel yet? - Who? Come on, the young man who's come here to be your pupil of course. - He can get up now. - Granddad, you'll take him? - Well, he can get up but not to stay here. I'm not going to take him. - Granddad. - Well, all right. I'll talk to him. But I promise nothing. - Why do you want to learn? - To get revenge. (dramatic music) Dad! Dad! Dad! (dramatic music) Chun-Shan! He killed my dad. And he left this. - He's dead. Forget it. Just forget it! Dump it! Throw the thing away! - No, it's all I have. I must keep it. - You keep it and you'll lose your life. - All right, take me as your student then I won't die. - Maybe I should take you, I don't know. - Well, bow to him, go on then. - Thanks teacher, thanks teacher. (mysterious music) (door creaks) - Mister, your tea. - Waiter! - Mister, was there something? - Do you know the old man, the one who had a chess stall here once? Where has he gone? - I don't know. The people say he just disappeared. It seemed some fella came, threatened him. Mister, you think this fella needs a lesson? All he can do is fight old men. - Get out! Get out! - Mister, I just hope you meet him and then you'll teach him not to avoid people! - Out! - Sure! I'm going! - Teacher, who do you think killed Yuen? Who would dare to do that? I mean, Master Yuen was pretty good. - I know this. We're gonna find out! - Sir. Once a pawn has crossed the line he has to stay. There's no way back. (calm music) - Teacher? Something I must say. I don't want to, but I must. - Go on. - Well, I've been here for a whole month. Till yet we've just played chest. I don't want that. I wanna learn Kung Fu. - Well, in fact you're already learning. Haven't you heard? The first virtue is to be calm. Calm must be the basis of Kung Fu. It's a mental discipline. And playing chess will teach you to achieve calmness of mind. I've never discovered a better way. (dramatic music) - Ghost Faced Killer! Now I've finally caught up with you! Wan Chun-Shan? (grunting) (laughs) (dramatic music) (grunting) - Knight to Queen two. To master this game you have to be, like I said, very calm, but also quick of wit, sharp of eye, fast of mind, slow of tongue, quick to see. (calm music) - All right, how's this? You're in check. - At dawn you start training. (calm music) You put two bricks on. - Yes, granddad. Granddad, I think it's too much. - How do you know what's too much? - Granddad. - Ever since he's been with us you've questioned my orders. I'll do it. (cringing in pain) Watch him. Every half hour add two more. - Granddad. Granddad. Granddad. Granddad, I think it's too much. - I don't want opinions. Just add on the bricks. - Add on, add on. His leg, you'll break it. I'm sure of it! - It's funny, you're normally fairly hard hearted. But with him (laughs). - Come on. Granddad. - Oh, I see now. This fella, he's got something, something quite special? - Listen... (screams) - Now look. He'll die. Anyway, if he wants to learn Kung Fu he has to stand it. Go on out. Take a look. But I think that he's playing tricks. - Yes, granddad. Ah Pao? Ah Pao? (snickers) - Hey, hey, hey, no more! You've gone on cruel! - You cursed me! - Yes, I will! - Have some more! - Damn you! - Damn you! - You! - Go on! - Damn you! You'll never get married! - You! (gasps) (dramatic music) - Now then, half strength is not enough. Stand still. Belly in! You must breathe from the stomach! With your shoulders level! And make sure your back is straight! Left wrist! Right wrist! Left wrist, right wrist! Now these methods improve your arm strength! Now you try them while I watch. - Yes, teacher. (calm music) (dramatic music) - Chi Sue Tin, I found you. All these years and you've not changed a bit! - What do you want? - What do think I want? I'm Wan Chun-Shan! And I want revenge. - Go on. Not your affair. Get out, hurry! - Get ready! - Five elements? (grunting) Tell me, all these years that I've lived I've made many faults but you were not one though. You're wrong. But I know who you want. The Chess King! - You aren't him? - No, I'm not. Chess King. He's living now in the Dragon Mountains. (dramatic music) - Hi, friends. Look, who's your friend? - Listen, I've only come here to see Master Yuen. So you could tell him that I'm here. - Hey, get the hell out of here. - Kid, now listen. Yuen has been killed. - What's that? Yuen has been killed? (calm music) It's him. It's him. It must be him. - Teacher, who do you mean? Tell me. - Ghost Faced Killer, Wan Chun-Shan. Whenever he kills he always leaves a plate. - What? Wan Chun-Shan? He's the murderer who killed my dad, and I'll take revenge! - Revenge? You're dumb then 'cause you'll be killed. You've been here a few months only. You've learned a bit, but take revenge? Not a chance. - Teacher, you're right. I don't know much yet. Every day I practice eight hours, but it isn't enough. So then I'll do more! I'll practice 16 hours! I'll work till I drop! To me, that's all that counts, one day to get revenge for my dad. And for Yuen too. For both. Yuen took care of me. Teacher, tell me. Why should Yuen have to die? And why was my father killed? Teacher? Teacher? Just tell me why. - My boy. It all goes back many years to the Qing times. Wan Chun-Shan was a high official, and a ruthless one. On his words many people died, and so the Kung Fu men tried very hard to kill him but always failed. And now he thinks it's his turn. He means to have his revenge on them. Your dad and Master Yuen. Right. Now I'll teach you properly. Your style must combine toughness and gentleness. It must have the power to stop the waves, stop anything! Yes! It's outwardly placid, but inwardly decisive. It's as fierce as an explosion! (dramatic music) Roll and make it hard but make sure that it's well controlled. I've taught you enough now to break his Kung Fu. But bear his technique in mind. The Five Elements, fire, gold, wood, water, earth. The earth absorbs water. Wood can beat earth. Gold can cut wood! Earth absorbs gold. - Once again! - All right. Just remember what I've taught you. (calm music) - Hey you, move it! (calm music) (screams) You! Brother? - We're not brothers! Look, you see that? - What's wrong? Your eye's all red. Going blind? - Garbage! You're right. My eyes are red, blood in them! The last time you hurt my hand, didn't you? - Well, it wasn't my fault, you hit the plate I was carrying. - Now I'll give you a taste of Chang Sing Kung Fu! (grunts) - Chang Sing Kung Fu? (grunts) - Hey, brother, no let me. Brother, what's that? - This is palm! Even palm, double palm, front palm, power palm, clear palm, back palm, strike palm! - Brother, you got many more of them? - Not right now. - I see. Left slap, right slap. - Don't! - And rolling palm. - Well, all right. Now the hook! The protection hook! Now the Y hook! Now the fishing hook! - Brother, your hook's gone stray! - All right, then I'll bite! You! I'm from the Chang Sing Kung Fu School. (laughs) I'll fix you! - You tell your teacher I'm gonna smash his skull! - Mister, who are you? (dramatic music) - He's the Ghost Faced Killer! - Teacher, you know him? Teacher? Sure. - Ten years and still he finds me. (calm music) Now listen carefully. As from today the school is closed. - Teacher, we live with you here. We'll die here. - Well, if you regard me as your teacher then obey me and leave. - Teacher. - [All] Teacher. - Get up! Get up! Didn't you hear me? You're all men. Well, all right, then you behave like men. Stand up straight! Just remember where you've come from. You come from the Chang Sing School. Now stand up! Go! - Teacher. - Teacher. - Go! Go! Go! (somber music) - Teacher, come with us, it's better. (somber music) (dramatic music) (laughs) - Wan Chun-Shan, you've come. - Waited for this for many years! I bet you'd forgotten me. Maybe thought I was dead! Well, do you recognize my technique? - Five Elements! (grunting) - Years ago your clan tried to kill me. Well now I'll kill all of you! (dramatic music) - Spare me! Ghost Faced Killer. - You believe it now? - I always did. - Oh! - You guy you helped, I was fighting with, that guy he has a plate like yours. - Just the same? - Sure. - Right. You have three days to find him. If not then the next plate will wind up round your neck. - Sure, sure. - Calm and keep calm. That's most important if you're going to win. It's not easy to appear calm. But if you do then you'll win. Calm is natural, remember that. - What? You mean that his teacher is that old man who used to play chess? - Sure. - Right. Let's find him. I'll get them all. Get the revenge I've been seeking all these years. - You hate them? - More than hate them. - Listen. That's the short way but rough to walk. Please. (foreboding music) - What do you want? (screams) - Let go! Let go of me! - Leave her! (laughs) - Chi Sue Tin, you act well. You really had me fooled when I met you. - You? - Granddad. - Let her go. She's not involved. - I don't want her, only you, my god An How! - Wan Chun-Shan, just drop the knife, act like a man. - Don't preach at me. - I must try. It may awake your conscience. Just for money you've killed so many good men. You ruined so many families. And now-- - But still you plotted to have me killed. Anyway you could. At least I fight you one by one. - Granddad! - Five Elements, and first the gold. And now we'll see how good you are. (grunting) You're not strong enough. The years have left their mark! - Granddad! - You're the same. - Well, my friend, ready to die? Now let's try the wood technique. - But the earth overcomes wood! - I don't think your earth can overcome anything. (grunting) Right, something else. Let's see you try the water technique! The sky is high, the cloud is low. But my water technique is hard to beat. - But the earth can absorb water. (grunting) - Your earth's not doing too well. (grunting) Well now, my friend, you're weakening. You have no chance, you know that. My hatred can't be stopped. It's taken years to find you! (calm music) - My eye itches. That usually means something. Forget it. Means nothing. (grunting) - The wood technique! - There's still time to go back! - Chi Sue Tin, just save your breath! (grunting) - Granddad! (grunting) Granddad! - Teacher! - Granddad. - Teacher? - Granddad. - Teacher. - Teacher. - Granddad? - So it's you! (grunting) Gold cuts wood! (grunting) Fire melts gold! - Use counter technique. - Right, teacher. (grunting) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Turning! (grunting continues) Rolling! (grunting continues) - Ying Yang style! - Double horse! (grunting continues) Counter fire! (grunting continues) Wood crosses lane. (dramatic music)
