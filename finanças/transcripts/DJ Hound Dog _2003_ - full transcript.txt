I like him how he's honest. - But I'm getting you know, I've had a few nights where I kinda, you know, they went with me. - I mean if you want to sell something that's completely different, there's only two ways just about everybody whose gone on to be a big DJ has made with success with their careers, especially in your case where you're doing something quite different. And the first one is promoting your own parties. Have you thought about doing that? - Well, you know, I have parties back at my house. - Clearly not then. The other really, really important one is basically making records, right? All the big DJs make their own records. It's assumed that if you want to be a successful household name DJ, you've got to make your own tunes. So, is that something you've thought about? You've met Anabella before, haven't you? - Yeah, I've been to some of her gigs around about. - I don't want to hear about that. Unless you fancy yourself as a great singer yourself, I definitely recommend hooking up with a singer because you want to give a track some identity. Once you've decided to go ahead and forge a musical career for yourself, then having a singer, having a hook, having something people can identify with is the way forward. And she can definitely do it as well as anybody. - Aww, thank you. - A lot of work then is in the studio these days. I mean it's not just happening on the dance floor. That's an illusion, it's all created. - DJs who just go out and play records and listen to the odd promo to decide what they're gonna go out and play are not going anywhere. It really is seven days a week, 24-hour day or thereabouts job where you've got to be making records, you've got to have exclusive tracks. - Yeah. - It's imperative that you're playing things that are your own. People can really sort of latch onto and identify with you to develop your persona. - That's my feeling exactly. But you try to tell the people at Alman's Pops. - But you're doing something different. And you know, life's great pioneers and adventurers have always been misunderstood. Some of them go on to be huge and successful, others unfortunately remain understood for the rest of their career. All you can do is make your own luck and try to develop what you got to offer and making your records is definitely what other big names do. ♪ Baby I want you uh-huh ♪ ♪ I want you two ♪ ♪ I want you three ♪ ♪ Baby give it to me ♪ ♪ Uh-Huh I want you four ♪ ♪ Baby I want you uh-huh ♪ ♪ I want you two uh-huh ♪ ♪ I want you three ♪ ♪ Baby give it to me ♪ ♪ Uh-Huh I want you four ♪ ♪ Honey give ♪ You scared the life out of me.

But what I'm worried about is, I don't know how this is gonna mix in to the big trance feel, you know? Because this where I have the problem is that when I start to bring the rock and roll in, it's always, I'm always losing the energy because it doesn't have the same force as the trance. - Yeah, I have an idea. Let's try if it works. - Okay. Now this is great. - Yeah, you like that? - Yeah this is it, man. - Cool. - All right, if we get some sirens going. - You're doing so good, you're totally kicking ass by the way. - I'm kicking ass.

This is my friend, she lives in the same building. - Oh since when? - Recently. She just moved. I made the kite go side to side so that means I can make the bass go up and down and also make you go side to side. So somebody had a great idea, and they had a really big group which is known as Kettlebell Brothers. And they put together a sequence of patterns of sounds and what they said was, "if we can make you feel the sound, we can make you see it. Just by emotion." Imagine if I played a tone that made you feel at peace with yourself. Just quiet, serenity, rainfalls. Just basically to yourself. No worries in the world.
