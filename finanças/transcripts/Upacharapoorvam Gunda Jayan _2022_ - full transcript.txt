APRIL 2002 VILLAGE OFFICE, POOCHAKKAL -When will it be ready? -In a week. Here you go. -Sir, mutation certificate... -Sit down. I'll come now. In order to do that, you should have rights over the land. Okay. -Satheeshan... -Yes? It feels nice to sit on Joy sir's chair. Yes, it's nice. But he has left a heap of work behind. Looks like he fled to stay away from the party workers. He won't be back anytime soon. Hey, why is the birthday boy silent? -Sir? -Sit down. Okay, we can do it. Is it... ...anything urgent? Sir... is on leave. I'm helpless. Let Joy sir come. When will he be back? Who are you? Whatâ€™s it? Get out from here! What are you doing? Dad... Please don't do anything. You should have thought while plotting against the party. Let go of the child. If you have any complaints... Well, my name is Jayan. Sir... Not just 'Jayan'. It's 'Rowdy Jayan'. If you come after this... I'll finish off your family. UPACHARAPOORVAM GUNDA JAYAN (WITH BEST COMPLIMENTS- ROWDY JAYAN) Mother... Dear, I'm coming. Mother... Dear, dad hasn't gone to the toilet yet. Use the other toilet. Please darling... Don't you know how difficult it is to clean it? Come on. Jayan, your tea. Where's my towel? -I had kept it here. -Where? Shucks! By mistake... How many times have I told you not to use my towel? -Mother... -Yes? Damn! Never understands! Come on...Shoot... Yes, get inside. Wait, I'm coming. -Do you want anything else? -Yes, shoot! -Shoot man! -Hey! Pubg 1 kg. Oh no! Sugar and onion. Onion is not there. It's there. Onion is over. Jayan! Rowdy Jayan, right? No, sir. It's Jayan. Why so? Stopped rowdyism? -How's business? -Going good. Are you planning anything? What, sir? Abu had come here the other day, right? He's started some shady business. Sir, he came to buy cigarettes. I left that company long back itself. Varghese sir knows about it. I haven't been to the police station in ages. Do one thing. Come to the police station tomorrow. Sir, not tomorrow. Should I check your convenience first? No, sir. My niece is getting engaged tomorrow. You should have thought of it when you went to assault people in the past. -Vargheese... -Sir. Don't worry. I'll manage it. Brother, my balance money? Don't you want onions then? Yes, but will you give? Hi Anjana... -Can you hear? -Yes. I wanted to be there. But you know my situation, right? I'm busy here in Dubai. I couldn't take leave. -Felt bad? -No. Okay. Why are you silent? You were quiet when I'd come to see you. Now also you aren't saying anything. Are you shy? Okay. So, carry on with the function. Let's rock the wedding. Okay, bye. Say something. Why were you silent? You were in the army, right? Yes. Colonel. Won't Sandeep take Anju to Dubai after marriage? Well, Sandeep hasn't told anything about it yet. Jayan, just a minute. Dear... Did you have to ask it now itself? Yes, we should confirm now itself. If he leaves her here and go, that lady will torture her like anything. Look, her face says it all. Mother, have a sweet. I don't eat anything sweet. I've got all sorts of ailments. See, didn't I tell you? Anju, why are you quiet? Jayan... Things are happening fast. Are you okay with it? Yes. It's because of Sandeep's leave issues. It's alright. I'm aware of it. Listen, don't feel bad. I won't be able to attend the wedding. Why? My daughter's delivery date is nearing. Leela and I've to be in Delhi for that. I'll come in a while. Listen, did you talk about the dowry? I will do it. Didn't you tell them the boy is working in Dubai? So? So we need the dowry accordingly. I didn't hear anyone talking about it. Is he educated? What if he's not educated? We've status. What? The girl is highly educated. I've told everything to Sandeep. Make this happen somehow. Don't you know my uncle has been taking care of me since my father's death? I can't come with you without their consent. I've already told you this. Hey! Why didn't you come for lunch? What happened? She's been sitting here and brooding ever since they left. I don't want this marriage. I want to live with the person I like. Anju, what are you saying? I want to study. Study? This is enough. She's been sitting here and sulking for the past few days. Don't think I'm not seeing you talking stealthy on the phone. If you have some other plan, just forget it. -I didn't like him. -Of course! Making a scene when the marriage has been fixed. Didn't I marry your father even though I didn't like him? Still we lived together. I was also like that. Do you know how nicely Colonel is treating me now? Jayan will be here now. You tell him yourself. Else, I'll tell. I'll show you. If Jayan gets to know of this, it'll be horrific. What's your intention? Your mother told me something. But... I haven't taken it seriously. If there's someone in your mind, I'll find him even if you don't tell me who it is. But I don't think it's needed now. But if at all the need arises, no one will see him ever again. I have fixed the marriage date. If I can bring you up properly, I know to marry you off too. That's enough. It's alright. What's this, Anju? -Reji! -Yes. Take this. Brother... Do you know anything about it? No, it came out of the blue. -Should I ask her friends? -No. Not now. I'd told them not to send her to Bangalore for studies. What's the use in saying it now? Marriage is next month. -I want you to be there for everything. -Sure Not just as a neighbour, but as a family member. Okay.

"What's in her mind?" -Do pay for the cab. -I've told Jayan. Don't delay it. Reji, introduce me to the bride's relatives. Don't reduce my payment at the end saying they are missing in the video. Take your things and come. I'll call everyone. Padma Amma.... Sister, call everyone. -Padma... -Yes? This is Jalaja, the bride's aunt. -Do include us in the video. -Sure. Reji, introduce him to Shymon too. That's her husband. He's a Colonel. What's it Reji? This is Padma Amma, the bride's mother. -Reji, have tea. -No, thanks. Brother, wait. This is Sajila, their sister. This is her husband Sahadevan. This is Jayan's wife Soorya. He's the one who paid you the advance. Isn't it over? Can I go? Sure. Son, my friends will be coming at night. When they come, do shoot their video properly. Sure. Is the bride ready? She's getting ready. I'll call her now. Okay. What about the bride's father and his family? Her father died long back itself. And they are not on good terms with his family. Father's brother is here somewhere. -Where? -There. That item. Sugadhan. Okay. Look at this stage! I haven't seen such a terrible stage lately. Yes! -Kunjappa... -Yes? -If it rains, it'll leak, right? -Definitely. Let it rain then. It doesn't matter to us. Yes. God knows if there's anything to drink. -Where's the card game happening? -Let's go and check. Anju... What happened? Anju... That guy she liked... His parents sent him abroad. She got to know from a friend just now. That's why. Is it? Thank God! Don't tell this to anyone. Okay. Anju, it's all over, right? Enough. Now get ready fast. Photographers have come. If your uncle sees you like this, he'll be rebuked. Dear... -How far is it? -Almost there. Someone from the bride's family should come and receive us. That's the custom of us Calicut people. Can't change the custom just because we're going to another place. -Isn't it, Suni? -Yes, sir. Actually he's not from Calicut. Settled down here after his marriage. 'Celebration', right? Didn't you inquire about him? I don't know. It was arranged by Reji. Sir, explain everything to him now itself. Else it would become a disaster later. I don't like anyone telling their opinions to me or my assistants. No one should enter the cooking area giving us orders. If someone steps in, you'll see my real character. Is this enough, Suni? Yes, sir. His food is superb. Didn't you hear him? If someone enters our cooking area, we'll mess up the feast. We've messed up many feasts like that. -Of course. -We'll mess up this one too. Listen... He's a bit crazy. Uncle, come inside. Did you call me? Is my dinner, bread and chicken curry ready? I've told Shymon to buy it. What about tomorrow's cigarettes? I'll ask him to buy that too. -Purushu... -Jalaja! Jalaja! You look worn out! Isn't your husband feeding you, dear? You know how she used to be earlier? This won't do. You should put on weight. I have brought nuts and dates. I'll give it to you. You must eat it. You'll see its result in four days. Sushma, how are things going? The usual. Sumesh, you've grown up into a handsome man. After all he's my son. So he'd definitely be handsome. Purushan, sit here. Sushma, come with me. -How did you come? -In our car. -Brother, were you sitting here? -No, I was just born. Who the heck is he! Goddess, bless me. Aunt, didn't Sarala come? Don't take that. It's for Jayan's friends. Some kids are sitting outside. Give them black tea. Purushu and his wife have come. Let me go and meet them. Keep an eye on her. I've kept it here. No, Jalaja has arrived. -Who's it? -Sarala. These colonels and their peculiar habits. He'll start to shiver if he doesnâ€™t eat bread and chicken for dinner. By the way where's Shymon? How's his studies going? He doesn't talk to anyone much. Always sitting alone and pondering. His father is saying he'd become a scientist. Son, where are you? When you come, get bread and chicken for dad. Also two cigarettes. Okay dude. Okay dude. He's so strict since he was in the army. To hell with her bread and chicken. He was a cook in the army. Gopi uncle has seen him once. Yes, else who would name a colonel Shylappan? Simply showing off! Suni, it's a bad sign. This coconut has got only three eyes instead of four. Goddess, bless us. Well, Pachadi Sura's food is good. But if you don't handle him with care, the game will change. Why? He's crazy. -Crazy? -Yes. He was your choice, right? See what he's doing. If he ruins anything... I've done my duties properly. Oh God! Why do you have to keep this daily? To ward off the evil eye. Don't eat it. Wow! Awesome! Why don't you smear two chillies on his eyes too? How about cucumber curry, pickle and plantain fry for dinner? Just give us something. Shall we start? Shall I chop the onions? Onions for plantain curry? Chop the plantain first. DON'T SMOKE HERE. I'VE ASTHMA. IF YOU SMOKE, YOU'LL SEE MY TRUE COLORS. Keep it. -How's this saree? -You could have worn salwar. Sali, put three tube lights on the road also. Okay. -Will you finish it anytime soon? -Almost done. Could have come earlier. Jayan, she took a lot of time to dress up. Else we would have come earlier. You look fit and healthy. Yes, I work out. So you got a six pack? No, my pack will arrive next week. Why don't you sit inside? New item. Oh God! -Sali... -Where are you? I'll be there in 5 minutes. These lights are not working. Come fast. Yes, I'm coming. Hang up. What's he doing? These lights! What's this? -Disco lights? -Yes. -Yes, it's disco lights. -The flickering ones? Yes, it's a new model. Isn't it good? It won't take much time. Are we late? No, people have only started to come. Place the cards. Those are used cards. Don't mix with them. That's alright. Chin up. Chin down. Little more. Enough. Hey, hold it properly. Not me. It's this boy. It's over. You can go. Okay. Susie... -You both came together? -Yes. Have this juice. Will you be going back to Bangalore after marriage? Yes. Uncle has come. These are Anju's friends. Come here. Have it. What's it? The groom's family will arrive now with the saree. Ask her to talk to them happily. You relax first. She's happy now. Her friends have come. Friends! Until this gets over... Hey, don't play with it. Oh God! She used to be so tiny. Look at her now! Hey, aren't you Purushan (man)? No, a woman! Where are you coming from? Let's take a selfie. Come on in. -How are you? -Fine. -Hi, dear. -Hi. -Darling, what's your name? -Ammu. It's a nice name. Shall I give you a gift? -What grade are you in? -Fourth. Kiran... Hey! Bye. -Sali! -What are you doing here? I came to attend the wedding. -Are you doing the set work here? -Of course! Brother... Bye. I don't go anymore. What about you? -Reji... -Yes? -Sura is calling. -I'll go. Come here. Did you see him? Tina is talking to Anjana. He's Anju's friend. But I have a doubt. What if he's the guy Anju was in love with? No, he's tall and fair. It won't be him. Go and ask. Okay. Why did you do it if you don't know? You'd have ruined everything now. Sali, heard that Anju's friends have come. -Are there any chicks? -There's one. Is it? How's she? Ask him. He'll give you the details. That's his fiancÃ©e. She's Anju's friend. I'm doing the set work for their wedding. Got it? Kiran, this is Reji. Hi. -I heard them talking about you inside. -Okay. I live next door. I'm in charge of everything here. -Where are you from? -Mohamma. Mohamma? I've got friends there. Won't you be here tonight? Yes, that's the plan. Nice. -Do you drink? -Of course. Brother, do call me also when you drink. Reji... Two full bottles are not enough for these many people. Didn't you finish it yourself? What's the use in telling me now? Don't ask unnecessary questions. My friends will reach now. Get the booze for them. Okay. Mr. Beard Man, see you later. What's this? Rotten tomato! Sir, I've been telling you for some time now. These won't do. If they don't bring fresh vegetables, I won't make anything. Call him and tell. Else I'll leave. Bloody marriage... What happened? I feel like smearing chillies all over my face hearing him. Tell him what the matter is. These vegetables won't do. These tomatoes smell like rotten eggs. You can't even eat the okra raw. He even eats dog shit. Where did you buy these from? -From Babu's shop. -Babu's shop! Who buys vegetables from there? When did we arrive here? Nobody is even there to pour me a drink. And they are conducting a marriage here! Go behind that tarpaulin. You'll get it. Okay. Brother, it's not what you thought. He's Anju's friendâ€™s fiance. He's from Mohamma. They are getting married next week. What Suni said is right. Please buy fresh tomatoes. Okay. You're not going to get it. They don't know me well. -Jayan... -Sir, when did you come? Just now. Let's sit inside. Smell of rotten eggs. Sir, these tomatoes are fine. I don't feel anything now. Boozed? Suni, if you don't feel anything, then I also won't feel. Yes, that's it. Don't finish the vegetables. I won't be able to make a curry out of you. Call someone to chop the vegetables. Shall I pour this coconut milk? Don't ruin it. Isn't it fine now? Hey, come here. Take a photo on this too. Anju, smile. Are you feeding the wolf? You can go. Got it? I'll show you. Please look here. Raji, come. Majeed... They are my society friends. Click a nice photo. Sure. Can you click a picture? Son, can you take a photo? Why are you not taking photos now? Take it. Come closer. Hold the light properly. This boy is so annoying. Move back. Okay. Donâ€™t be late tomorrow. Don't leave without having food. Okay. Give it to me. Anju, don't you know them? -Oh no! -Good! I think this cabbage is rotten. Vegetables from his shop are always rotten and expensive. I'm sitting outside. See, the Dubai wolf is in action. There's a rumour that he has got another family in Dubai. Who's he? He's a distant relative of Padma. Okay. When are we going to finish this and go home? Next one has come. Make it fast. Don't you want to go home? That knife is sharp. Be careful. He's looking over here. No, I'm not bored. You don't have to come here. I'll call you. Say Hi. It's live. Next we're entering the cooking area. There are many ladies here. But I've found her. I've found the beauty queen of this house. Susie! Get up. Move. How do you know my name? I know all that. See, this is Susie. Now this ambiance has become colorful. Say something. Hi... Hey! Shall I say? No, I need a sweet voice. That's why. Speak. I'm Susie's husband, Solomon K P. Manu, where have you reached? These lights are not working. He's so dangerous. Darling, I've reached. Fourth house from the turning, right? Yes, I've reached outside. Damn! When is he bringing it? It'll take at least an hour to reach there. Don't give him hope. It's okay. Have you started? Hey, should we call Reji? Let me have a peg first. Did you come here to have just one? Like Mohanlal said, drink until you can't stand straight and lose your mind. Drink in the company of such people. I can't stand straight. Now... I want to lose my mind too. You've already lost it. Mr. Light Boy, leave. Sali, pour him a drink. Did you buy it and come? No, my dad is in the army. I always carry it when I go for functions. Please give me your phone number before you go. Sure. No! Don't ruin it. Mr. Light Boy... Don't stand here. All the lights are flickering there. Go! Got more? Yes, I'll give it to Sali. Get it from him. Okay, I'll meet him. Shall I pour? Pour. Sura, shall I keep the coconuts here? Yes. Reji, can you please arrange bread and chicken curry? Okay. Shymon didn't buy it. Please donâ€™t forget. He'll place this house upside down. I'll arrange. Come on, bring it. Joker, come inside. First! Give me the money. He's winning it all. Go and do something else. Why do you want our money? Don't take your hand. Keep it here itself. It's lucky for me. Whose turn now? Shuffle them. Damn! Power cut! Should have stayed at the cooking area itself. Don't know if Susie has left. Susie... She'd go missing if there's a power cut. Sugadha, keep the money safely. Boss, what the heck is this? It's completely dark. Nobody is going to eat until the power is back on. They should have arranged a special light for us at least. I'm leaving. I've become sober. Don't go. -Didn't you fill petrol in it? -Yes, I had. Open it properly. There's petrol in it. Damn! It's not turning on. Hold me. Let me check. Pull it. One... Two... Where's Anju? -She's there inside. -No, I checked. Is it? Hey, pull it with force. I can't do it anymore. You try. One... Two... Three... Four... Oh God! Six... Seven... Eight... Sixty eight... -Sixty nine... -Move. Yea, it's hurting. If the power is not back on, I'll set this into fire along with you. This man... Where's his number? -What happened? -No idea. Manu, where the hell are you? There's a power cut here and the generator is not working. Didn't you say you reached here? Son, I'm going to the town. It's an emergency. I'll be a bit late. I might come only by morning. Sir, are two people enough to bail us out? Yes. Listen, can you ask two of your friends? They all pass out by evening itself. Susie.. Susie... Susie... Best place to come in search of Susie. Did you set it right? Yes, in one go. I tried many times. Which saree are you wearing tomorrow? Anju is there in her room. She had gone outside to the toilet. What about the toilet in her room? It's broken. What happened to you? I won't have peace of mind until this gets over. -Dear... -Yes? Sambar. Thank you! -Got anything? -What? -Got anything? -Yes, at home. -Shall I bring it here? -No, I'll come when I'm free. Okay. Bring the plantain curry too. I think she's not interested. I haven't got any single photos of hers. Brother... We've got military stuff. It's only two pegs. Let him have it. If you need anything, tell Reji. Okay. Let's drink comfortably now. What about munchies? I've got chicken curry. Had bought it for Tina. Chicken curry? Don't take it then. I need it. It's for Colonel Shylapan. I forgot about it. Colonel! Hi bro! Wait, I'll give. What's the use in being an NRI? Nobody is there to pour me a drink. Everyone is present. Awesome. -Sit here. -It's alright. I didn't come earlier because of Jayan. He's not at all updated. I happened to belong to the new generation. Hey, wait. Let me have the local stuff first. We can drink the foreign later. I'll pour. No, I will pour it myself. Finished it. Will anything happen if we mix local with foreign? Not at all. It's good stuff. Is it? But I'll get a stomach ache. Have to attend the wedding tomorrow, right? I'm taking it back. Let's party tomorrow. Good night. I've to go and eat dates. I spoke with him. I felt like slapping you hearing him talk. Hey... Only his family and their status matter to him. He has left. Just forget it. Anju... You're starting a new life tomorrow. We knew that you'd be upset. That's why we decided to stay here tonight. This is the reality. Please accept it. Be positive. Stay happy. Okay? "I saw her in my dreams" "She appeared in my thoughts carrying flowers in her heart" "It's like the birds are singing nearby" "It's like the flowers are blooming nearby" "She..." "Like a breeze..." "Like a butterfly..." "You're there in the sweet melody hummed by the flowery breeze" "Day, night, rain and mist are all singing about you" "Beauty of the night and fragrance of the flower go in search of you" "She..." "In the night sky, firefly and rainbow..." "I caught sight of you" "My heart is brimming with tears, words and laughter" "In the dream, I'm singing by the shore, drenched" "I saw her in my dreams" "She appeared in my thoughts carrying flowers in her heart" "It's like the birds are singing nearby" "It's like the flowers are blooming nearby" I don't want it. I ate. Kids, go and sleep. -Jalaja... -What? Your husband is hanging around at the cooking area. If the chef gets irritated, he might throw chilly powder at him. Go and call him. Oh God! What's he doing? Keep sitting and chattering! Come, let's go. Your dinner is ready. It isn't 9.45 yet. It'll become 9.45 by the time we get there. Come. It's chicken pepper curry. Keep it there. Oh no! Soorya... Did you see the bread and chicken curry? No, where did you keep it? I had kept it there. Oh God! What will I tell him... Where's my bread and chicken? I think you're a Pakistani terrorist who has come here crossing the border. I swear on my bread and chicken... If I had a bomb with me, just like how I blew up the Pakistan border, I would have blown up this house and you. Traitor! Why do you have to say this much Hindi for a bread and chicken like kids? -We're not understanding anything. -Shut up! Who's your kid? I'm this nation's protector, Colonel Shylappan. Don't talk to me as if you're talking to some cook. Idiot! Hey Colonel sir. Relax... Relax... I can understand your pain. But a high ranking officer like you shouldn't talk like this. I finally got to meet an Indian after arriving here. Come, let's talk. Coming, son. You move. Come. Kiran... Military life has gifted me two disciplines. First is bread and chicken. But today that... Second. Two cigarettes while going to the toilet. -Looks like I won't get that... -No, I'll arrange it. You can trust me. I came with my fiancÃ©e to attend this wedding. I don't know anyone over here. Now I got a good friend. Sir, you carry on. I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you. Victory for Mother India! Sambar. Everyone will be partying here tonight. You sleep at uncle's house with Anju. Take her friend also. Yes, that's better. The toilet in her room is broken. I've made your bed in the south room. I'll keep your dress for tomorrow there. Aunt has kept Purushu uncle's clothes also there. Please tell him. Kunjappan, have you seen this before? It's a foreign item. To be honest, I was not interested in attending this wedding. But my wife forced me to come. I don't like Jayan at all. But I felt happy seeing you. Do you know how they treat me despite being the bride's uncle? I'd to cancel many programs back home to come here and play cards. But when I saw this... I mean when I saw you, I became happy. Shall we go live on Facebook? Sir, my hand is hurting. Wherever I go, Kunjappan accompanies me. He's my aid. I get a sense of relief when I entertain paupers. Kunjappan, have it. It's expensive. Take only a little. No, I don't want it, sir. How can I have it when you're also drinking the same thing? I don't deserve it. He's so humble. Are you finishing it? Hold it carefully. Come here. Move. He has no status. I won't get 'likes' then. This is Sugadan, the bride's uncle. Okay, speak. I'm her uncle in name only. It's my brother's daughter's marriage. But till now I haven't even got a black tea from here. I've never attended such a crappy wedding... -You can't talk like this. My fans! -To hell with your fans. Kunjappa! My Kunju... Do you know me? My cognac. Do you know how much it cost? Foreign my foot! Who's the pauper here? Did you show me on Facebook? You crook! Kunjappa, what's this? You pig! Who's your aid? I'll butcher you both. His fricking Dubai! How could he swear at you after gulping down your booze? Let's show him. Come on. -Do you have more stuff? -I'll have it alone. Hey, I'm not a troublemaker. Hello... Anjana's mother? Yes, who's this? I'm Sandeep's girlfriend. I want to see how he's going to marry her. I won't let this marriage happen. Hello... -Soorya... -What happened? Some girl called and told me that Sandeep has an affair. She said she'd stop this marriage. Stop the marriage? Who? See, it was a prank call. Shouldn't we tell Jayan? What an idea! He's already stressed. It was just a prank call. Get to sleep. Come. Oh God! I've heard a lot about your food. Is it? What's the use in that? Nobody is calling us. I don't know how I got this order. I think they called us by mistake. Are you doing it alone? Why are they sleeping? Let them sleep. They are doing me a favour. -Shall I get you a black tea? -No, thanks. Aren't you sleeping? You can sleep at Reji's if you want. It's alright. I'm comfortable here. Listen, only payasm is left to be prepared. You must drink a glass of payasam before the feast begins tomorrow. Then I'll get the next order soon. That's our belief. -Tomorrow? -Yes. Belief my foot! Play carefully. What the hell is this? Have it. Damn! It was black tea. I misunderstood. Spade...spade...spade... Spade! Lost! Damn! Please give me 10 rupees. I can't give anymore. I'll leave if you don't have money. Don't irritate me. Lost everything, right? I'll stand closer. Get lost you scum! Why are you clinging on to me? Then sit on my lap. Made me lose all my money. Unlucky fellow! Who's he? Who knows? He's been hanging around here for some time now. Go! Go and sleep. Place the cards. Go home and sleep if you've lost money. I really wished to marry Anju. Is it? Then let me pee here. Yes, let that happen at least. Kunjappan. Did you see Sugadan? I'm his aid. Can you give me ten rupees to go home? No, I don't have it. Go! It's alright. I'll come back. Who locked this? Let it be anyone. But I'll go first when it's opened. Try to open it. Else break it down. Damn! What's this, bro? I shouldn't have eaten the bread and chicken yesterday. Shucks! Have they kept gold in there to lock it? Who knows! It might be in there! You can never tell with these people! Right! Uff! Even Burj Khalifa is open 24/7! Non-stop! Who even cares about this stupid toilet! Who the hell locked it? This can't be forgiven. It's an injustice towards the Indian army. Of course. I think Sugadan is behind this. Yesterday night he told me he'd wreck this marriage. If we can't shit, then it's ruined. He doesn't know me. It was here somewhere. Damn! Who locked this? He's acting as if he doesn't know about it. Are you playing with Sahadevan? Oh God! Oh God! Mr. Light Boy... Bring me yesterday's rum. My hand is hurting. Hey! -Is Sali there? -Sali... -Kiran, right? -Yes. Abhilash had told. What's the matter? He told me little. But I didn't understand it clearly. Come, I'll tell. Don't you have a function at Thavanakada on 18th? Yes. That wedding should be stopped. What? The bride is your... Then why do you have to wait till the wedding day? Ask her to come. We'll stand with you. She won't come like that. And at present I'm not in a situation to get married. Oh! I can't let go of her like that. Don't worry. We can do something. Abhilash is dear to me. That's why I'm taking this risk. I'll stand with you. I can do only that much. That's enough. -Hello... -Anju... We're on our way. Don't worry. Listen to me carefully. Do as I say. Shed some tears if you can. What happened? Anju... The guy she liked... His parents sent him abroad. Thank God! They are watching us. If they ask anything, tell them that I'm Tina's fiance. Okay. Yes, I've found her. I've found the beauty queen of this house. Get hold of Purushan uncle. He's going live on Facebook from here. Download that video. Ask Anjana for his profile details. Should we take that chicken curry as munchies? It's not a normal curry. I've mixed SP tablets with it. Let's use it to trap as many as we can. Let them run for their lives tomorrow. No. Please ask Reji. Don't tell him it's for me. -It's not possible. -It is. You go. Just go! Drink until you can't stand straight and lose your mind. Drink in the company of such people. I can't stand straight. Now, I want to lose my mind. Is this the same powder? No, this one is stronger. There is a little in this. It's military. Should we give it to Anju's uncle? It's only two pegs. Let him have it. Second... Two cigarettes while going to toilet. Arrange two joints for tomorrow morning. I'll arrange it. You can trust me. Let him dart around tomorrow. Anju, listen to me. I can't do it. Be positive. Stay happy. Oh no! Anju is there inside. She'd gone outside to the toilet. What about the toilet in her room? It's broken. All okay? Give it to me. Hold it. Hello... You have? One more. What's the use in that? Nobody is calling us. There is a way to get orders. A chef from my village told me this. What? Tomorrow, before you offer the food to Lord Ganesha, give a glass of payasam to the person who's hosting this wedding. You'll soon get the next order. Is it? It's Jayan who's hosting this wedding. -The round eyed man? -Yes. Okay, I'll do it. Shall make him drink a couple of glasses. I think he's coming here. Sali, get up early tomorrow. Okay. We've got lots to do. They have invited over 100 people. But there's only one toilet. Should they build 100 toilets then? In Dubai, there would be three toilets for one person. Sahadeva, two songs are over. If you don't come out now, we'll open the door. Get lost! He won't come out anytime soon. -It's weed, right? -Yes. Come. -One puff. -From this? Wait. Sir... Be grateful. I'm on time, right? Yes. He's not an ordinary guy. He's always busy. Colonel will be going off his head today because of his son. Let him! Where did you buy this saree from? -Have you ordered the flowers? -Yes. Someone has gone to buy it. Listen, can we take the photos now? Didn't I tell you before also? Allow me to finish this. Leave. Jayan will start calling now. Please, let me finish this. Don't distract me. Does anyone want to iron their clothes? Wait. Come here. You could have bought more flowers. I didn't get any. Flowers! Are you not bathing? The bathroom door fell off. I need to go to the toilet. Come, let me check. -Jayan, what's up? -Everything. I think it's Sajitha. Wait. It has been used by many. Are you okay with it? This one, right? Can't you smile? -Have they brought the flowers? -Who knows! Kiran... What? Okay. Okay. I didn't get flowers. -What happened? -Nothing. -What the heck is going on here? -What happened? That beautician is not letting us click any photos. Don't expect me to reduce my payment at the end. If you don't do your job properly, I'll throw the equipment into the canal. Go! He's mad. That female was bettter. Brother, didn't you get dressed yet? The priest is asking for you. Will this burst? -Of course. -Let's see. Is this smoke coming from his body? He's participated in wars, right? So, it's natural. He thinks he's from a royal family. Sir, why didn't you call me while preparing the payasam yesterday? Why should I dig my own grave? That's why I didn't call. Did you check if everyone has eaten? Why? I'll help. -Look at the smoke. -Please move. Sugadha, it's my turn. Hey! Oh God! Bull shit! Come out! Open this door! Wait till I finish. Open the door! Sugad, open the door! Sir... He's gone off his head. Sugadha, please come out. Come. The same old rifle. -Ramesh, come and help me. -It's all set. Don't tug on it. Sorry, I didn't see. Did you call me? You haven't bought everything. Some items are not there. There is only one apple instead of five. How will I manage with this? Just manage with what is there. Whatever! I won't let these photographers roam around here. Tell them yourself. Don't come to me complaining later. If something like that happens, you'll see my real character. I'd ironed my clothes. Whose underwear is this? Where's mine? My foreign underwear with lily flowers on it. It was from Emirates mall. Oh God! People who even nick underwear! I won't wear this. I'd rather not wear anything. I should keep everything safely. Damn! What happened? Nothing. Just a minute. Okay. I was getting ready to come there. Is it? Where's Solomon? He's gone for work. I'm alone here. Good! To.. Where's the bathroom? Inside the bedroom. Bedroom... It's alright. Come inside. Over there. What's this? Don't you have to go to work today? Yesterday I didn't get leave when I said your father is sick. So I killed your father today. Who's that? Listen... Who's it? Who's that? Oh no! I don't know. It might be some robber. Open the door. Else I'll knock it down. I don't know. It's your last chance. I'll knock it down for sure. So you won't open, right? Move. Susie... Susie... Oh no! My darling... Don't cry, sweetheart. Take a dump, darling. Take a dump. Shouldn't we go for the wedding? My sweetheart... Don't cry. Darling, we've to go for the wedding. Make it fast. Take a dump. Don't cry. Brother... I think this belongs here. See. This shouldn't be seen here. Go! I got it from the yard. The groom's family will arrive now. I'll come now itself. Let's put this here. Is it okay now? Isn't it over? They are calling. Keep this flower also. Kiran... Can you help me with my saree? She's here. Okay. Okay. Can you move? Aren't you Purushan uncle's wife? Do you know him? Of course. He's so smart. He'd come live on Facebook yesterday. Didn't you see? -No. -I'll show you. See... Next we're entering the cooking area. There are many ladies here. But I've found her. I've found the beauty queen of this house. Susie! How do you know my name? I know all that. This is Susie. Now this ambiance has become colorful. What happened to your hand? I hit it with a rock just for fun. -It's vodka. -It's alright. Let me know when you want it. I'm also ready. Okay. Little more. -Little more. -It's correct. Enough. Hey, the photographer is calling. Come fast. Is it? Give this. My God! Please move. -Move aside. -His photo! Brother, come closer. Son, make it fast. I've got some work. -Work? -To get drunk. Next family. Okay, Bye. Jayan, come on. Jayan, come here. Sister, please move. Stop this drama. Come. What's he doing? Where did you do the beautician course? Why do you want to know? Stop it. Shymon, come here. Hey, come on. Everyone is ready. Is he crazy? Shut up! Do you know what all he did yesterday? Let him do whatever he wants. Such a patriot! Isn't it? Come on. Dear, come here. Come, stand here. Stand here. -Where's your house? -Thuravur. I've been there. Come, let's go. Call someone else. Why is your mother like this? What happened? Has everyone left from uncle's? Yes. Didn't you go yet? What? Hey, the groom has arrived. They are calling you. I think it's for the reception. Sali... All set? The groom will come now. What's the delay? Why isn't he coming out? Who knows! Isn't this reception enough for him? What kind of an NRI is he? Go call him. Call him after some time. Ask him to come fast. Brother... We're ready. Brother, open the window. Please open the window. Why isn't he coming? Please tell him. He's showing attitude. He didn't even open the window. We've been waiting for so long. Why the heck can't he come out? Listen, don't come and stand in front of me rotating this? Get lost! Isn't there an auspicious time for this? Was just asking. Ask the groom to come. It's time. Else the priest will get angry. Can you ask Sandeep to come out? Come, let's shoot their visuals. Open. What's it? Come fast. It's getting late. Didn't I tell you not to hurry? They are... Weddings happen only once. It's to get good photographs that I hired an expensive photographer. Sanu is coming directly from Singapore. Is it? It's our good fortune that he agreed to come. I'll come out only after he arrives. You go. Okay then. Let's take a selfie. Please move. He's waiting for the photographer. He'll reach soon. Santosh Sivan or what?. Didn't that man slap you? But I don't know why he slapped me. Anyway, I got one tight slap. He's searching for you there. Is it? Sit inside drinking this. Don't come out. I won't open even if you call. Move aside. It's been so long. Please ask him to come out. There are already two photographers here. One from each family. Phew! He is not like them. He's a top-notch photographer. He's come. Sir... Your coat. I don't want your fricking coat. Hey, I'm at Cherthala. A petty wedding. No, I'm free. Yes, Singapore. Candid, right? Okay. Bro, it's time. The priest is annoyed. They have been waiting. What's the hurry? This won't work like that. It's because you 'liked' my Facebook post and pleaded I agreed to come. No problem. It'd look nice if you wear the coat and click photos. I'll charge you more if you want me to wear the coat at such shoddy places. Is it? I'll pay you. I had told you something while paying the advance. What's it? My friends are saying my bum is huge. My buttocks. Please take the photos accordingly. Why didn't you leave some at home? The other photographer shouldn't disturb me. Not at all. -Also, your family shouldn't interfere. -No, they won't. -Ready? -Yes! Come on. Oh God! Here is the groom. Come on. Hold this. Don't start. Move that man. That man! His shirt is not correct. That maroon fellow. Jayan, you're the maroon fellow. But he's the bride's uncle. That's alright. Let's do as he says. Please. Let that boy give. -Yellow? -Yes, the yellow fellow. That's my son Sumesh. He was supposed to marry her. Son, you do it. Garland? Wait. Give me that garland. Now put this. Now give him the bouquet. Shake hands with him. -Have you brought the ring? -No. Then we can all go inside. Who's this old man? Arrogant fellow! Who's that? Superb! What a tacky stage! Can't you smile? Who's brooding inside? Please put your dress properly. Ready? Smile! Hey you! Don't step on the garlands. Don't mind me. They'll be using your photos in the album. Say yo! Dad... Two... Three! Once more. Look here. Enough. You don't have to take it. Sanumon will take it. Okay Sanu? Bro, show me the photo. You didn't take it, right? He's been showing attitude ever since he came. Even we felt bad seeing the way he's treating you. It's okay. Leave it. Come out for God's sake. Who the hell is it? What's it? It's time for dakshina. Come fast. Make sure everyone gets on the bus right after lunch. There shouldn't be any delay. Go. Hello... I'm a distant relative of the bride. Your son is so smart. Just like you. How about a drink? After the wedding. Else my wife would make it an issue. Is that so? Your fate! Listen, thanks a lot. You accepted our girl even after knowing everything about her. It's a big thing. What? Didn't your son agree to marry her despite knowing about her past? That's why... -You were not aware of it? -What? Then I'm not going to say anything more. Because you're an innocent man. That's why. Things will get better after marriage. That's all. Keep this between us. Don't tell this to anyone. I'll see you after the ceremony. I'll see you. -What about your kids? -They have got exams. Hey, come here. Listen, one man told me just now that this girl had an affair. Didn't we get a call yesterday? Please shut up. Is this the place to say such wicked things? I know you're irked since this proposal was brought by my brother. Whatever! But there's something fishy. Your brother shouldn't have married from this family. He didn't even get his medicines on time. Poor man! Give it. Give her at the end. Are there any other elders? Sugadha... Give it. -Next. -Jalaja... -Come. -No, after my husband. Hey, come here. It's getting late. Come. Give. Did he leave with it? Everyone is crazy here. Hey army, it's not paan. It's for dakshina. There's only one. Bring it back. You can give the rest on the stage. Give me five minutes. Let me adjust her saree. Is this the time for it? Make it fast. What's to do now? Bring her to the stage. We'll bring her. You please go. Where has he gone? Hey, did you see a short man? My aid Kunjappan. Have you seen him? No. Where's he coming from? -Didn't you go to dig pits today? -No. -Are you wearing pants? -Yes. Pant! Hello... Are you related to the bride? I'm the bride's uncle. What happened? Well, I'm a distant relative of the groom. What happened? Does she have any flaws in her horoscope? Who knows! I asked since you're marrying her off to such a boy. What? -Uncle, look here. -Sandeep... I'm Kiran, Anjana's friend. Show me that hand. Superb! Weddings happen only once in our life. So we should definitely hire such photographers. He's so good. I'm thinking of hiring him for my wedding too. He's so expensive. Weddings happen only once, right? I've got some reference photos. Why don't you take such photos? Show me. Isn't that a horse? There is no horse here. But the bride's uncle has the stamina of a horse. If he carries you on his shoulder with your friends dancing around you, you'll get excellent photos. Sounds good. -Can we take a selfie? -Why not. I can post on Instagram. I'm a straightforward person. He was in love with a girl recently and tried to commit suicide. This is his rebirth. You could have inquired about the boy. Though he's my brother's son... Brother's son? Yes. All these are not a problem nowadays. Things will get better after marriage. Let her suffer. Let her suffer! She has an uncle. He used to be a troublemaker. If I say something, they'll take it in the wrong sense. It was his decision. Her fate! Let them all suffer. Why should I bother? -Sorry. -It's okay. Come. Hey, can you take my daughter's photo? I'm busy. I don't take other photos during weddings. Sorry. Please leave. My daughter is interested in acting. That's my daughter. Gorgeous! Beautiful! Let's do it after the ceremony. We can do a proper photo shoot. Okay, we'll come after the ceremony. Sanu... Please come. I have a wish. What's it? I have got an idea. Can you take a photo? I don't take photos on other's ideas. Anyway, what's it? When I enter the stage, let the bride's uncle carry me on his shoulders. And my friends would dance around us. That one shot... Awesome! Bring the uncle when it's time. Bring it fast. What are you doing? -Shall I keep it here? -Sura... The ceremony will start now. You won't be able to do it after that. -Did you give him the payasam? -Oh, I forgot. Give it now. Get me a cup of payasam. What? -Payasam? -Yes. -Why? -It's for the bride's uncle. Hey, bring two cups. One is for me. Go inside. Colonel sir... Soldier, wear your uniform properly. I was observing this military camp. Sir, let's go to the parade ground. Come. Listen, can you take me to the kitchen after that? Colonel sir would hit me with his belt if he doesn't get food on time. It's painful. Let's have one more and go there. Should we attend this wedding? Let's chill here itself. We can come and go. You're family to me. It's like that for me also. So, I'm going to tell you something. Don't feel bad. The bride is really sweet. But I didn't like the boy much. And I heard awful things about him. Also, he doesn't regard you. Yes, for sure. He doesn't know me well. It happened to be a marriage ceremony, else... One more? Yes. Have it. Such a bad climate! Hello... Sorry, who are you? -Me? -Yes. I'm the bride's aunt's... I'm Purushan from Dubai. The boy is also from Dubai. I'm his uncle. Have you made inquiries about the boy? No, I'm attending this since they invited me. That's all! There's a talk he got married to a woman in Dubai and it later became a big issue. So, do something. He's an experienced guy. I'd say our girl is fortunate. -Isn't that Sarala? -How will I know? I know. Sarala... When did you arrive? Hey, who all are there at your house now? Everyone is there. What happened? I want to go to the toilet. Now? They will come here now. Alright. It's hard! -Is it time for the ceremony? -Yes, in 10 minutes. Can we start serving soon after that? Yes. Give it. Have this. -What's this? -Payasam. -Payasam? -Yes. I can't drink it now. Please leave. That won't do. Didn't I do my assigned duties flawlessly? Now, if you don't do what I say, you'll see my real character. I'll ruin the feast. I'll drink it. Sir, shall I put sand into the curry? Wait, he'll drink. -Drink. -He's crazy. Just drink. -Here. -Are you happy? He loved the payasam. Let the ceremony get over. I'll end their lunacy. Okay, let's eat together. You belong to which side? -What about you? -I'm from the groom's side. Then I might be from the bride's side. You haven't been invited, right? You aren't also invited, right? -See you for lunch! -Yes! See you. Are you crazy? -Are you blind? -I'm not. Please forgive me. You belong to which side? I'm the bride's relative. I'm a distant relative of the boy. Come here. You should have inquired about the girl before fixing this. Still, they shouldn't have fixed this poor girl's marriage with such a boy. Call the bride. Let's go. Move aside. Together. Look here and smile. -Isn't she happy? -I don't know. Move from there! Make way. I don't see her wearing any gold. I think it's rolled gold. And she's being married to a moron. Look at your brother's choice. No gold and on top of that has a bad reputation too. Shut up. Please move. -Move! -Oh Sure. Where's the groom? Son, go. Listen, I want her uncle to carry me on his shoulders to the stage. It's the idea of my friends. Ask the bride's guardian to come up. Brother... He's saying he wants you to carry him on your shoulders to the stage. -No need. -No, it's needed. Sanu, all okay? Double okay. Guys, come here. Mr. Beard Man, is my help needed? Yes, it's needed. Listen, is it necessary? Yes, it is. -Shall I call them? -Yes. It's a new trend. That's why. Stop it. Call someone else. I'm in the eye of the storm here. His crazy ideas! Brother, you go. Carry him on your shoulders. He'll take excellent photos. You can do whatever you want. But please come up. There's an auspicious time for the ceremony. Please tell him to carry me. Go, let the wedding become lively. What have you decided? Okay, I'll carry him. Brother... Son, sit on my shoulders. Come, sit on my shoulders. Not this one. -Why does the shoulder matter? -Not this kind of shoulder. Climb. What's the plan? He'll marry her now. Don't worry. A bomb will explode now. -Bomb? -Yes. What bomb? Come. What are they doing? Who knows! Hey, don't keep him down. Please say 'yo' on the count of three. Not now. I'll tell you. Silence! I'll say it. One... Two... Was it you? Suni, did we put extra lentils in sambar today? Not from this side. -Is it from here? -No. Who was it? What's this? What? Laugh at him. What's it? Bro, what did you do? What? It's alright. No problem. What are you saying? It wasn't me. Leave it. Let the ceremony begin. Don't laugh. Don't make fun of him. What's there to make fun? It wasn't me. It's alright. Leave it. What? Leave it. What the heck are you saying man? Man? Who's he to talk to me like this? Sahadevan, shut up! Please leave it. Brother... The groom is so arrogant. This proposal was brought by her uncle. They deserve it. Son, don't show attitude. What did you say? He'll definitely show attitude. -Dad, please sit there. -He's from Dubai. Look at her gold. It's because he's nice that he agreed to this marriage. So he'll definitely show attitude. If I had known that your brother found a girl from such a horrible family, I wouldn't have agreed for this. Who's this guy from Dubai? The one who made such a nasty sound during an auspicious event? Horrible family? I decided to accept the girl even after getting to know her past. What did you get to know? We got to know horrendous things about your son also. Sugadha, stop it! No, I can't stop. She's my niece. Sugadha, don't make an issue. -I don't understand anything. -Sandeep, it's alright. Let me see your brother. Such a bad alliance. -Father, please stop. -You shut up! Come down. Brother, leave it. Who's your brother? You stay here. It's their family matter. Get lost! Don't make an issue. Who are you? Back off! I got to know her stories only after coming here. What did you get to know? As if your son is a virtuous guy! We know that he tried to end his life for a girl. -Who ended life? -You only. Please stop. Why should we take the blame for the wrongful things your girl did? Stop it! If you say anything about my child... What will you do? Hey! What about my booze? [hums a film song] Oh God! What a performance! Let me share this. Six... seven... Yellow ones are mine. What happened here? Why would people fight like this over a fart? These are new generation weddings. This will be posted on social media. -They shot it from different angles. -Is it? In that case, we can give the next quotation like that. -How? -'Food & Fight' by Pachadi Sura. That's nice. Sir, what are we going to do with the food? Pack it. Looks like we won't be getting our payment from here. Don't cry. Jayan will find a way. I can't bear this. What shall we do? What's happening here? There's no use in talking about it now. What's meant to happen will eventually happen. I feel we should have given them more thrashings. I got a call at the same time. Else I would have shown them. Let Jayan find another boy himself. He only created all these problems. Since you're her uncle, let me tell you something. I'm ready to accept her as my son's bride. I'd asked them once. But they were all so demanding back then. Just give him what you've got. It's to save her life. Who else would marry a girl whose wedding has been called off once? -Isn't it, son? -Yes. Jalaja... One tea. Why don't you just poison him? Colonel my foot! Shall we go and tell them that you're ready to marry her? Stupid! Don't ruin it at the last moment. If I reveal myself now, they will understand that I was behind this. You're right. My parents are very hostile. But I've got time now. They are discussing marrying her off to Sumesh. I think it's a good idea. Purushu is not such a bad man. Also he's immensely rich. Well, his wife's face is always like that. Well, he's a bit flirty. But I feel he's doing it out of love. Talk to Jayan. Jayan doesn't like him much. But try to convince him. What's Anju doing? She's sitting there. I don't know what to do. Damn! What all happened! There's something. Anju's friend had contacted the guy she was in love with. Where is his house? I don't know. He said he isn't interested anymore. He also told her not to contact him again to talk about this. If we don't find a way now, it'll be difficult to get her married later. So, why don't you talk to Reji? For what? He might be able to help us. We've known them for a long time. It's a good family. They will agree. His job is almost confirmed. Everyone will put the blame on you if this marriage doesn't take place. I can't bear to hear that. Jayan might agree if we all talk to him. We can convince him. He's coming. Jayan... Purushan's son is ready to marry Anju. Can we... Just because something happened, I won't send her to his house. That too with a dumbass boy! I know what to do. Who's in a hurry? Didn't I tell you then itself? I wasn't interested. He's a bizarre man. The way he talks and walks is just... Isn't it? Hey, please give us a minute. I didn't think it would become like this. I made a decision without even asking your opinion... ...thinking that you'd get a good life. I... I see you as my own daughter. So... I'm going to do something. Everyone is blaming me now. That's alright. But... I want you to stand by me. I'm thinking of getting you married to Reji. Even if I have to beg him, I'll conduct this marriage. Hello Kiran... There's news. There's a problem. I need to talk. Sir, there's a bigger problem here. Let me solve it first. You solve your problem. But I'll leave only after solving my problem. I'll wait here. Sir, what happened to you? Who are you? I'm Anju's best friend. Someone broke into my house today morning. It was to take advantage of my wife. I noticed her yesterday. Isn't she fair? So you noticed her? Let's solve this. Come on. Come. Uncle... Uncle, please come. For what? It's an emergency. What's the emergency? Aunt, please ask him to come. You also come. Come, let's go. Get up. Brother, please come. Uncle, you also come. -Where are we going? -Someone is waiting there. Is it any old relatives? If it's to find another boy, I won't allow it. No, someone is waiting there. Who's it? Come. Oh no! What happened? Who hit you on the head? Where's Susie? Someone entered his house today morning to attack his wife. He didn't see the man's face since that person hit him on the head. Who? Wait, I'll talk. Though I didn't see him, I have got the evidence. It's a foreign underwear. Isn't this my missing underwear? The one we bought from Emirates mall. Got a conclusion, right? Pathetic! Aren't you ashamed? We're not interested in your proposal. Don't forget to take your son when you leave. After all he's your son. Disgusting man! Some crow must have dropped it there. Are you coming with me today? I'll come tomorrow. Don't be late. Jayan is coming. -Reji? -Brother... Reji... -Brother? -Just a minute. Reji... You know the situation, right? That's why I'm asking you this. I don't know if it's right or wrong. Can you marry Anju? Brother, that... I know it isn't a decision to take in haste. But, I've no other way. I don't want others to see her as an ill-fated girl. Can you do us a favour? I haven't seen her like that. I know that. She had a relationship. It's common at this age. She's not a bad girl. That's not what I meant. Anju is okay with it. I'll talk to your family. They won't have a problem. But I haven't got a job yet. I know that. It's alright. I know you will look after her well. Come, let's have tea. Reji, no... Aren't you coming to the groom's house for the first time? Have tea. Reji, I'll have it. But before that... What's it? I haven't... -Isn't it outside? -Yes. It's true. Do something now. Else he'll marry her. Tina, all okay? What's it? There is a something against Reji on this. Come. Just do the rituals alone. What's his plan? Didn't he do this much? This is so easy for him. Wait and watch. What are you doing? He's marrying her! That's why I played this. What? What else can we do? Shouldn't we do something? What can I do if he wants to marry his girlfriend? His girlfriend? Then why did you say that you both are in love? Shall I tell you another story? Come. I can't wait till then. One guy is coming to see me next week. That too uncle's friend's son. My dear Anju... I don't have a job yet. It'd become a big issue since we're neighbors. And you're not ready to come without your mother's consent. Didn't Tinaâ€™s family agree when Kiran spoke to them? Tinaâ€™s parents are educated and sensible. Not like your family. You're always blaming my family. Oh God! Anjana had called me. She asked me to talk to you. Think properly and decide. If it fails... If it fails, I'll bring her home. It's not that. I want him to fall on his knees and beg. Reji's sweet revenge. If you have any complaint, Well, my name is Jayan. If you come after this, I'll finish off your family. It's difficult to forget it though he hit your father by mistake. It's not because youâ€™re scared of him, right? Slightly. Listen to my plan. Pachadi Sura for catering. Majid for photography and Priest Satheeshan to do the rituals. Arrange them. Since Jayan has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, we can make use of it. Keep the glass on top of that bottle. Keep it. Keep it carefully. It's the wedding venue. Don't drop it. Let it be there. One girl will come as the groom's girlfriend. She's my friend, from Bangalore. We can deal with her. By that time, everyone will get to know of their relationship. Coming to Anju... Give her confidence when she enters the stage. I'll do the rest. I'll set a trap for Jayan, Sahadevan, Shylappan and others. Rest is fine. What did you do? Now place this glass on top of it. They wouldn't be able to process things since they won't be in their right minds. And the wedding would collapse like this. I just wanted to see you. Anju, everything has been arranged. Please don't insist on meeting. Enough, come. He'll connect the generator now. Come fast. Come. I called that guy just now. He's saying he doesnâ€™t want her anymore since she agreed to this marriage. Reji is a nice guy, right? She has told me they are good friends. He might be able to understand her. Even if she resists, we can persuade her. Find a way to conduct this marriage. Why don't you talk to Reji? Can you marry Anju? Can you do us a favour? But I haven't seen her like that. I know that. You're unbelievable! You could have told me that it's for Reji. Even if they doubt me, it's fine. But if the plan fails... Isn't it good to keep suspense? -Where are you from? -Thrissur. I've been sent to my mother's house to behave well. Good! I want to know one more thing. Okay, Shylappan. Sir! Okay, son. See you. I'm going. See you. I'll be calling you on the first. Bye Reji. Happy married life. Okay bye. Anyway, the wedding took place. Yes. I was going through a difficult phase. Difficulty in conducting a marriage, right? No, not that. There is something more difficult than that. Bye. We're leaving. Tina... Here you go. It's our wedding. Do come with your family. -Okay. -Bye. Alright. WITH BEST COMPLIMENTS, ARUN VAIGA Sali asked me one last question. Who was the real reason to call off that wedding? Paulo Coelho has said that, When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. There were two people who unknowingly helped us to execute our plan . Even if we plan extensively, God will always have a bigger plan. We should teach the groom a lesson. What lesson? Our usual lesson. Shall I go to the stage then? But it should be a bombshell. Sure. Go. Hey, set up that light. One... Two...
