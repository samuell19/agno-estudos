Look, there's Dobe. Tell him we got it, Roy. All right, boys. Now they're on their way. Now don't anybody get overanxious. These Renos ain't ordinary robbers. They've got instincts like animals. At the least wrong movement, we could lose them. So wait till they come out of the bank with the money, understand? Out of the bank. All right, now you deputies take your positions. The rest of you people take your places along the street, like we planned. Little one's three cents, and the big one's five. Renos are coming! Too bad Mr. Peterson has to miss this. I don't think we can get the Renos to wait. They're ready in the bank? They've got everything set. Good. Clear the street! The Renos are coming. The Renos! Now, there's North Vernon, boys. Now nice and casually. Remember, today you're a couple of farmers. We're all set? Get out of sight and stay down. Now wait till they come out of the bank. This time, we're gonna nail them with the goods. Awful quiet, Frank. Yeah. I don't like it. It ain't natural. There ought to be more people around. It's got to be natural. Nobody knowed Nobody knowed we was coming but us. It would make it easier to get away. Frank's right. I don't like it neither. You're getting jumpy in your old age, John? Quiet. What do you say, Frank? Keep going. We've put in too much time to pass this up. Well, we're in it now, Frank, might as well go through with it, huh? What do you say, Frank? We'll take it. It's a trap. You fools. Come on. We can't leave Bill. How bad is he hit? He's dead. Come on, Sim. All right, let's ride! We couldn't arrest 'em over there even if we caught 'em. Jackson County. The Renos run it from top to bottom. Well, we got one of them anyway. Yeah. Let's head back. Is that going to help? Is that going to bring Bill back to life? Take it easy, Sis. How? Not knowing when you go out that door, if you're ever coming back. This time it was Bill. And the next time somebody else. That's the way it is, Laura. It doesn't have to be. You could leave this state. You could go somewhere where nobody ever heard of the Renos. Where would that be? Anywhere. It was my fault, honey. I smelled it. I smelled it! Ain't no use carrying on about it now. Important thing is how did they know we was coming? Yeah, how did they know? And so far ahead. Maybe somebody recognized you last week, when you were sizing up the job. Maybe. But how did they know when we was coming? Is that our dear brother? Yes. So it's finally happened. A Reno got killed. Clint, we want no preacher. Take it easy, Sim. The baby of the family dying in the streets and his big brave brothers running away. Not even animals would do a thing like that. Dead in the street. Not dying. As if that made any difference. That's enough of that kind of talk, Clint. We sent for you, Clint, uh... 'cause we want you to go to North Vernon and-- and get Bill's body. They will let you have it. You mean they won't arrest me. A Reno that's honest. That's quite a distinction in this community. An honest Reno. We rode into an ambush. Somebody told them we was coming. That shouldn't surprise you. The Renos are worth a lot of money. Dead. You knowed we was going. You accuse me of being a traitor! I'll kill you! Wouldn't put it past you, you mealy mouthed Psalm singer. He was right fond of Bill, Clint. So was I! I tried hard enough to keep him from pitching in with you. And you. As long as you live, don't you ever accuse me of being an informer again. You got plans. Keep 'em to yourself. I don't want to know about them. Not even accidentally. You won't. You're notorious outlaws. The law will get you sooner or later. And they'll get you anyway they can. In the bank, ambush, while you're sleeping. They'll get you! Bill's death was only the beginning. Can't you see that, Laurie? Can't you see it? I'm not doing anything. You are harboring them. What do you expect me to do? Paul would never have left you the house if he'd known how you were going to use it. I can't turn my own brothers out. How far does loyalty go? They're not only destroying themselves. They're destroying you, too. Leave her alone, Clint. Peterson won't leave her alone! He won't leave any of you alone. We can handle anything that Peterson throws our way. Like you did today? All right. I'll go to North Vernon and get Bill. We'll bury him beside Ma and Pa. Perhaps, their souls will be a little less troubled now. Three of a kind. Such a gall. Such unmitigated gall. Those kind would never be elected if the women folk could vote. Yeah. But we'll get to vote one day. Nobody to blame but ourselves. We voted him in. Well, why don't we do something about it? Have you forgotten? Eddlebach tried, look what happened to him. We best let Peterson take care of the Reno brothers. They was waiting for us. Loaded up and waiting. Somebody told them we was coming. Maybe Peterson's got a man planted in town. Who knowed you was going to North Vernon? You three. Now hold on, Frank. He's not accusing us, Judge. He knows we wouldn't kill the golden geese. Did Clint know you was going? It wasn't Clint. He ain't one of us. But he wouldn't have no part of setting up an ambush. Maybe it was Sim. He's kind of talky when he's drinking. Yeah. And he does most of his drinking at Murphy's place. And he's bragging. And Murphy's the only new man to come to town in years. Do you suppose Murphy is a Peterson man? Give me a beer, Murphy. Hello, Sim. Doing a little drinking, eh? Yeah, going to do a lot more. Shot him in the back. They shot him in the back. Yeah, I heard about Bill. What happened over in North Vernon? I made a mistake. I shot too fast. Woke up the town and... they got Bill and shot him in the back. All my fault. Clumsy. All my fault. I don't think Bill would have felt that way. He always thought you were the best. I was the best till-- till I made that mistake. I let Bill down and... now he's dead. He's dead. Yeah. We all have to go sooner or later. But they're gonna go sooner. Coming Saturday, we're going back to North Vernon and blast the devil outta them. We'll get even for Bill. And this time, we'll get the money. We'll get the money this time. Murphy. What happened? He closed the saloon about ten, I followed him home. Through the window, I saw him write a note first. Then he went out to the barn, saddled a horse and left. Where did he go? Up the Glendale road. Couldn't follow without him knowing it. How long ago was that? Thirty, forty minutes. But where does he mail this note? They know he hides it someplace for another Peterson man to pick up. A stinking spy. We'll find about that soon enough. You reckon he'd be home by now? We'll wait. We've got time. Tell Dobe to get the horse. Dobe, I'm ready to mount. Why, Frank? Where have you been, Murphy? Riding. One o' clock in the morning? Is there some rule about when a man go riding? You stinking spy? Spy? What are you talking about, Sims? You're a Peterson man. Peterson man? You're crazy. Don't lie to us, Murphy. You know me, boys. You've known me for a long time. Yeah. We know you tipped off Peterson that we was gonna raid the bank in North Vernon. Why would I do that? Because you're getting paid for it. You just delivered a letter saying we were gonna hit North Vernon again. Didn't you, Murphy? I don't know where you got such an idea. We baited you, Murphy. Simmy just played like he was getting drunk and giving away secrets. We knowed that it would flush you out. And Cortright saw you write the letter. Cortright's lying. Get a rope. You kill me, Frank, somebody else will come. We'll handle him, too. Tie him up to the stall there. John, get that horse outta there. Maybe we ought to let him come, too, so he'll know what's happening. Ain't got the time. There's another letter for Peterson. Monk Claxton's here, Dad. Oh, good. Have him come in. Come on in, Monk. Thank you, Bill. Hello, Mr. Peterson. Glad to see you, Monk. Sit down. Thank you, Sir. How are things in Denver? Couldn't be better, Bill. Did you read about Murphy? Yes, Sir. I did. And that's what happens when something goes wrong. They're shrewd, those Renos. And vicious. Control a whole county in Southern Indiana. Judge, prosecutor, constable, all on their side. Renos had them elected. I still wonder how a thing like that could happen. Well, people who've had freedom as long as we have sometimes take it for granted. Come election day, they're lazy. Or careless. Same thing. However, it's done. Our job is to get it undone. Yes, Sir. How do we go about it? You're a married man, Monk. Yes, Sir. My wife knows the line of work I'm in. I don't want you to jump into this thing. I didn't know exactly what you had in mind but to bring me all the way from Denver, the way I figure it, this is sort of a promotion. Well, don't let your vanity get in the way of your better judgment, Monk. I'm a working man, Bill, with a job to do. If I didn't like my work, I would've gotten out of it long ago. In the war, we called it calculated risk. Yeah, we did. I've got a new man I want you to work with, Monk. I don't figure this is the time to break any greenhorn. Oh, new to us, that is. He's had some experience along this line. Maybe not experienced with this kind of violence, but, I think he's the kind of a man that can handle himself in rough going. Name is James Barlow. Barlow? I see you remember him. It's the same James Barlow I'm thinking of, I do remember him. He is. He was in the employee of the Southern States. Which we found out after the war. Mr. Greeley said that he was worth a whole army. It's the only thing that Mr. Greeley ever said that Mr. Lincoln agreed with. I'm still wondering how he got hold of so many secrets. Certain Generals' wives found him very charming. Irresistible is the word, Dad. As a matter of fact, I recall... Well, I was in the army when they had invited him for dinner. Secretary Stanton had him, too. As modest as it may sound... man who could fool Stanton and me could fool the Reno boys. It sounds mighty reasonable, Sir. You ought to trust him implicitly. Let him run the whole show. How does he plan to get in with the Reno brothers? He doesn't. He plans to let them get in with him. In making out your report to the Sheriff on this robbery my description is as follows... six feet three, 195 pounds, hazel eyes and brown hair. Six-three, 195 pounds, hazel eyes and brown hair. We just hit the grate. It'll be about half a minute. Good, pull the chord. I'll get to the rear end. Now, you want me to dump the box when you give me the signal. After I jump, take a few shots at me. Remember I took your gun but you have another one hidden. First I take some shots at you, when the train stops, I give the alarm. Right, open the door. Right on schedule, Jim. Morning. Morning. Ain't that old man Euall's rig? Yes, he's my uncle. I'd like a side of salt meat, ten pounds of sugar, five pounds of coffee, some baking soda and a bathtub. All right, mister. Morning. Good morning. I take it you're Jim Barlow, Noah Euall's nephew. That's right. Said a couple of days ago, he was expecting you staying at the farm. Mm-hmm. I hear you're a painter. Yes, I am. What do you paint? Oh, well, things, people. Like El Greco, Rembrandt, Van Dyck. Not quite. Oh, uh, this is Mr. Claxton. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. You a painter, too? No, I'm just looking after Mr. Barlow. He's not fully recovered from the war. Oh! Morning, Ms. Laura. Good morning, Mr. Fisher. Is my order ready? Yes, just finished it. Oh, uh, Ms. Reno, this is Mr. Barlow. How do you do Mr. Barlow? It's a pleasure, Ms. Reno. Noah Euall's nephew. He's a painter. Oh. Will that be all, Sir? Excuse me, please. Mm-hmm. Uh, three dollars and 20 cents. Mr. Fisher, can you change this? Mr. Barlow? Don't you got anything smaller? Sorry, I haven't. Hmm. Take all my change. Here you are, Sir. Thank you very much. And come again. I'll do that. I'll be around for some time. There you are, Ms. Laura. May I help? Oh, don't bother. Quite the contrary. Well, thank you. Who's that with Laura? I ain't never seen him before. Thank you very much. I hope to see you again, Ms. Laura. May I call on you sometime? Boy... I'm afraid not, Mr. Barlow. Who are you, mister? That's none of your business, Pete. You better be on your way, you. I beg your pardon? You heard him. On your way! My friends, you haven't very good manners. Monk, take his gun down. Sorry, Ms. Laura. Still up to your old tricks, right? Thirty thousand dollars Frank, that's a heap of money. Are you out of your mind? I told you we didn't do this train robbery. The robber wore a mask. Had hazel eyes and sandy hair. Was around 35 years old, six feet, three inches, weight, 195 pounds. The description fits you, John. Careful, Lattimore! It's a lot of other people, too. Thirty thousand dollars. The judge would be mighty pleased to share in a heap of money like that. We didn't do it. But I wish we had. Don't argue with him, Sim. You're in no position to get uppity. Listen you've got your full portion of every job we've ever pulled and you'll go right on getting it. So don't come here accusing us of holding out on you. All right, Frank. But as prosecuting attorney of this county, I warn you! You sure was rough on him. I'll be rougher not to accuse us anymore. Sit around doing nothing while we take all the chances. At least he's in the hole. You've got to pay for aces in the hole. Thirty thousand dollars is a heap of money. Now who would've thought of holding up a train. Seems like a business worth considering. What was the matter with them? Oh, money crazy as usual, they're accusing John of holding up the train. Yeah, but Frank shut them up real properly. You think it's smart to make them mad? They better worry about making me mad. How did it go? Fine, Noah. You set it up well. Good. Buy some extra shooting iron? No we met a young lady. Two gentlemen objected. Turned out to be a couple fellows named Lee and Pete. They're a couple from the Reno gang. The family? No, just henchmen. Well, you certainly started the ball rolling, all right. We sure did. That's the object. But the description does fit John Reno. John Reno didn't do it. He doesn't do anything by himself. Frank does all the thinking. Frank didn't do it, either. His mind don't run that way. You're too suspicious. I've got a right to be suspicious. Our share keeps getting smaller and smaller. First thing you know they'll deal us out completely. How can they? We'd be re-elected next month for two more years. They know which side their bread's buttered on. You think we can get away with this for two more years? Our collusion with the Reno brothers is one of the worst kept secrets in history. Collusion, conspiracy, maleficent. Ugly words, Your Honor, but true. We've got to be realistic. That bank job in north Vernon sure would have helped. No need crying about that. We'll make it up on that Davies County job. How much do tax collections run? Might amount to 20,000. It's time we protect ourselves. We'll send Jason or Cortright with him. They ain't had no experience in that kind of thing. Oh, it doesn't matter. When the money is counted, I want somebody there we can trust. Will you ever find anybody you can trust? Here, Judge. That was the boss at the bank. Just come across one of them 100 dollar bills from the train robbery. Serial numbers check. Where did he get it? With Fisher's deposit. You reckon one of the Renos spent it? We're sure gonna find out who spent it. Sure, I remember. First 100 dollar bill I've seen in years. Noah Euall's nephew spent it. The one that tangled with Pete McCartney and Lee Harney? That's right, name's Barlow. He's a painter. New fellow. He had to be new to tangle with those two. Had a whole handful of 100 dollar bills. Something wrong? No, no, no. We're just checking. Did you hear that? A whole handful of 100 dollar bills. Something else, too. He fits the description of the holdup man. I'd say he has some explaining to do. You fellows better get at it. I'm getting sick and tired of you snarling at me. Well then, behave yourself. You know how I feel about you taking up with strangers. I didn't take up with him. He helped me into the buggy with my packages. Well, the boys said you and him were getting mighty friendly. Now you understand one thing. This is my house. You want to go on using it, you better be careful. All right. Let's get back to the Davies County job. This time we're all not going in at once. We're going in three lots. What is it? Somebody I've never seen before. Thank you to bring these back. Guess those two cooled off enough to be trusted with them. Besides, it gives me a chance to see you again. Hold it. Get inside. Don't order me around, Frank. What do you want? Why, nothing. I'm just returning some equipment that belongs to friends of Ms. Laura's. Some pistols. Drop them. Now back away. Who's he? I'm her brother. Well, mister, I must say you don't act very neighborly. I've got no cause to be neighborly. Get off the property and stay off. Didn't come to see you, came to see Ms. Laura. You heard me. Stop it, Frank! Stop it! It's all right, Ms. Laura. Needn't be trouble, I'll see you someplace else. When you're coming into town again? She ain't. In the morning. See you then. You may think you're spiting me, but let me tell you something. Anything goes wrong, you've got just as much to lose as the rest of us. Get that through that pretty little head, will you? Get one thing through your head, too. I'm not a child. And I won't be treated like one any longer. I hear mice. Put your hands up. What's going on here? You, too. Who are you? The law. Anybody else inside that house, come out with your hands up or I'll shoot this coney for every dime it's got. Maybe not. Mind telling us what the charge is? Suspicion. Suspicion of what? Train robbery. Train robbery? Why you're a bigger fool than I thought. All right, boys, take them into town. You can't do this, I tell you. Most disgraceful thing I've ever heard of. Who do you fellows think you are anyway? The law, that's who. Take them in. Six nice, clean, crisp 100 dollar notes. Shall we forget the judge and split this between us? Why? Why... Why not? Let's have a look inside. We were coming to Seymour from Robinson, Illinois. We saw the crowd around the money box. We went down there. There had been a train robbery. We found the money, I guessed the robbers dropped it. For three hours I've been telling you that. And for three hours we've been telling you we don't believe it. I can't help it. Sit down. May I have a drink of water? No. The money matches, the description matches. Your arrival here matches. Everything matches. Coincidence. Where is the money? You took it. I mean the rest of it, I mean the other 29,000 dollars. Oh, what's the use, you won't believe me. Any news? He won't talk. How about him? Nothing. All right. On your feet. Come on. Where's the money? Lattimore was asking him questions. All of a sudden Barlow said, "Get the judge." And Lattimore got excited. Kept saying he was the prosecuting attorney. Barlow had anything to say. He was the one to say it to. Naturally, I'm the one to talk to. Lattimore's trying to hog everything. He wants to talk to you. So I hear. Go ahead, talk. Hello. You listen to me, I'm the prosecuting attorney here. Wait outside. This was my doing. He never budged, till I threaten to get the express messenger down here to identify him. That's what weakened him. Wait outside. What else do you want to say? May I have a drink of water, Judge? Go ahead. Do you appreciate irony, Judge? How's that? The imponderables. The little things that happen to wreck a full proof setup that you can never figure will happen. This was a fool-proof setup. I had a contact man in the express office who told me when the money would be shipped. I picked the perfect spot for the train robbery. The money box was opened just right. And up to that point everything was perfect. And then... And then came the imponderable. In my hurry to get away, I dropped a few bills with serial numbers. And here I am. Irony. Where's the money? Hidden, my share, that is. Your share? You're in this all by yourself. No man could do this by himself. There were six of us. Seven counting the contact man. Where are they now? Scattered. That leaves three here. Two, Claxton and me. Euall had nothing to do with it. He didn't know about it. Claxton's share hidden, too? With mine at the Euall farm. Where at the Euall farm? You couldn't find it. I'd have to go with you. Now, you're a practical man, Judge. Sure you can send Claxton and me to prison but, it won't get you a raise in salary, it won't get you much of a reward. And as for me, with a contact man who knows when the big express money shipments have to be made... It'll ruin a million-dollar business. You say you got a contact man at the express office? A big one. A superintendent. Which office? I'm a practical man too, Judge. How do I know you ain't lying? You think I held up that train on the spur of the moment? How do you think I knew the money was aboard? A million-dollar business. But not with me in prison. If we don't get it, somebody else will. I don't like the way you talk. Like the way you handle yourself. All I need is a little freedom. Now, it won't be that simple. A lot of people, here in town, know you were arrested with some of that holed up money in your possession. All you got to say is I have proved I found it around the money box. Others did. And what guarantee have I got if I turn you loose, you won't pull out? The best in the world. I need you more than you need me. This is a safe place to hold up between operations. Besides, if I did pull out, you'd still be better off by three thousand dollars. Hmm. Gentlemen, I guess we owe Mr. Barlow an apology. He's clean as a hound's tooth. Wait a minute. Perhaps, you misunderstood me. Mr. Barlow had nothing to do with the train robbery. He found the money. Well, that was our opinion, too. Yeah, clean as a hound's tooth. Yeah. Get Cortright release the other two. I'm going out to the Euall farm with Mr. Barlow. Mind if I go, too? And me? Try and stop you. Oh, by the way, did you two gents give the judge his share of the six hundred dollars you took from me? Here you are, Your Honor. Three thousand dollars. And this is only the beginning. All right, so far so good. Now, where do we go from here? We have to wait for news from the Head Office. Well, let's hope it won't be too long. We hope stronger than you, since we're the ones who've been cleaned out. Well, good day, gentlemen. I'd rather nail up those three than to turn in the Reno boys. Take it easy, Jim, one thing at a time. Was that three thousand even? You'll get yours, Mr. Prosecutor, you'll get it. Just asking. You know, I was just thinking. He'd be a good one to send to Davies County with the Reno. It's either Jason or Cortright. Maybe. One thing, he don't scare easy? You reckon, the Renos would stand for it. They'll have to. We'll make it a court order. Come on. Anything else, Ms. Laura? Oh, yes. I'd like a side of bacon. But yesterday you--- I know. I'd like another side of bacon. Very well. Eight-and-a-half pounds, all right? Fine. Anything else? That's all. Here's that article you asked for, Ms. Laura. Oh, thank you. Goodbye, Mr. Bishop. Goodbye, Ms. Laura. Howdy, Laura. Oh, Clint. Uh, Mr. Barlow, I'd like you to meet my brother, Clint. How are you? How do you do? Nice meeting you, Mr. Barlow. It's all right. It's um, a book I borrowed from Mr. Bishop. Interested in painters, Ms. Laura? Yes. Sixteenth century painters. Oh. I don't think you're gonna find me in this edition. What time shall we shop tomorrow? A couple more shopping days like this and I can open my own store. It's been a genuine pleasure, Ms. Laura. I agree. Thank you, Mr. Barlow. Good day. You aiming on getting yourself killed? Contrary, I was just planning my future. I don't like you, Barlow, don't like you at all, but I admire guts. Judge Hawkin says you're pretty good at train robbery. Fair, I'd say. Seems to think you're good enough to ride with the Renos. That's a compliment. My partner and I will consider your invitation. No partners. Judge didn't say nothing about nobody. Just you. I see. When do we go? Now. Now? Uh, where? When you ride with us, Barlow, don't ask no questions. Come on. Whoa! Let's give him a blow. Ain't that the state line we just crossed? Right. Anyhow, now you're telling me where we're going? Up ahead. How much farther? You ask too many questions. What do you mean by that? Look, you're along as an extra hand. You got nothing to say. Didn't the judge make that clear? Yeah. All right, now, I'm making it clear. So, get it through your head. All right, let's split up. Circle around and go in. Dobe? Yeah. Meet us on Church Hill. Take John and Sim up in front of the Surveyor's office. Come on, John. Is everything all right? Tell Frank the courthouse is no good the front way. They got to go round up back. But Frank didn't plan it that way. Frank didn't plan to have the sheriff eating his dinner across the street either. You see him. They'll be alone. Pete says we got to use the back door of the courthouse. All right. Let's go. Here they are. Raise your hands up! On your feet and move over. We've got men downstairs, so don't nobody holler. Over the safe, you. Hurry up! Against the wall. All right, open it up. Be quick about it! Ain't much money in here. I know what's in there. Now, fill that up! Get your hands a little higher, neighbor! You! Get over there. Move! What are you doing? Throw it out here. Get out of here. Hurry! Frank! Too bad your brains don't match your guts! How much you figure we got? Plenty. Nice and clean, if I do say myself. We left those boys far behind. Yeah, but they still got the telegraph on their side. This is where we split up. Every man goes back to the house his own way, roundabout, too. Move out! I reckon you didn't hear me right. I said, "This is where we split up." I don't know this country. Well, go with one of them. I'm going with you, seeing as how you're the one that's got the money. Twenty-one thousand two hundred twenty dollars. Well, split between ten of us that's 2,122 dollars a piece. That don't seem like very much. Could have been more. Why wasn't it then? Ask him. Everything was going fine till he took a shot at one of the clerks. If I'd let him get his hands on that pistol he'd have blown somebody's head off. Should have put him on the floor in the first place. Should have put them all on the floor the moment we went in. You don't think much of the way I run things, do you? No, not very much. Two thousand, a hundred twenty-two dollars a piece for all this work and risk. You'd be better off if you went back to plowing. You'll get a chance to see what kind of a job you come up with. Won't be for chicken feed like this, you can bet on it. Count out my share. I want to get to bed. This time, I'll divide it with Claxton, but next time, he's got to be in on it. Goodnight. Cold as an icicle. Mighty big for his britches. Handles a six-gun real pretty, though. Real pretty. You paint a pretty picture, Mr. Barlow. I'm sorry if I disappoint you, Ms. Laura, but as you know, in our business, a little dishonesty is necessary now and then. So, you're no better than the rest of them. In fact, you're not as good. At least the Renos don't pretend to be something they're not. I am flattered by your interest, but... if you were attracted by the painter rather than the man, maybe it's better you find out now. I guess it is. I don't expect very much of people... but I believed in you. I wanted to believe in you. I wanted so much to believe in you. I can't wait any longer. I got to get a message to Peterson. Why don't you wait till morning, Monk? He'll turn up. Maybe so, Noah, maybe not. He might have been sidetracked from his business. You know, I was warned about his fondness for women. You better get a horse saddled. As you say. Somebody's coming. That's funny. It's gone around the back. Good evening, gents. Hi. Noah, I want you to get a letter started on its way to Peterson. I'll saddle up right away. Right. Where've you been, Jim? What happened? Several interesting things, Monk. Several... interesting things. A letter from Barlow, Dan. Good. Hmm, he's making progress. Wants me to meet him at the Sheriff's Office in North Vernon as quickly as possible. Oh! Get word to our field man that I'll be there Friday night. You best make it Saturday night. May take a little while to find Hyronemus. He's always on the move, you know. Oh, Saturday then. Hyronemus. What a name! Yeah. Howdy, Noah! Well, I'll be doggoned. You think the old man has many to sell? Selling anything new? No, but the old stuff is getting better. I want you to meet my boys. Jim, Monk, come here. This is my nephew, Jim Barlow. Happy to make your acquaintance. Howdy. Barlow, Monk Claxton. Acquaintance, Mr. Claxton. What are you doing back in this territory? I got a fine line of enamelware, stewing pots and side dishes. It's all right. You can talk now. We're by ourselves. In my business, friend, caution becomes a habit. Barlow, Mr. Peterson wants to meet you Saturday night. Where? Sheriff Mosley's office in North Vernon. I'll be there. That's probably Barlow. Hello, Peterson. Glad you could make it. And good to see you, Jim. Sheriff Mosley. Sheriff. Howdy, Barlow. Deputy Bonner. Howdy. Howdy. I was beginning to worry about you. I did a little worrying myself. How's Monk? Oh, just fine, just fine. Sit down, sit down. Now, gentlemen... here's the layout. I got the clique all primed for a big haul. All that's necessary is to bait the trap but, we must bait it well. It's a telegram. Indianapolis. "Here's Barlow, Seymour, Indiana. Based on yield this year, next corn crops should reach 100,000 bushels, and we'll need your help to farm. Aunt Mary leaves here Friday, the 11th... on Train 58 on her way to Louisville. Try to see her for a moment at Seymour." What does this mean? That's from the contact man at the Home Office of the Express Company. It means... Train 58 leaving Indianapolis for Louisville, this coming Friday will be carrying 100,000 dollars. A hundred thousand dollars! So, that's it. 100,000 dollars. It's the answer to everything. Means we can go to California. Now, gentlemen, I wouldn't be buying my tickets yet. Remember, Friday's only three days off. That won't get me enough time to get my men together. Claxton and I can't handle this by ourselves. You got the Reno boys. I don't get along with that clodhopper's crew. They done good so far. Reputation, yes. But they're still clodhoppers. This is a big job. It has to be handled right. Otherwise, I'd rather pass it up and wait for another one. But when will that be? I don't know. What if the Renos followed your orders on this? You know how they feel. Frank wants to run everything. But suppose he lets you run it. Yeah. Yeah. You understand, they're my instructions. I won't have any arguments from anyone. Over that kind of money, we can afford to let you run things. There can't be any hit and miss about this. We'll meet at the Euall farm at 5:00 in the morning. I'll be waiting. "I'll be waiting." I'll blow the top of his head off. After we get the money. Hello, Clint. Barlow, I got to talk to you. What about? Laura. I want you to get her away from here, before it's too late. I've tried to get her away myself. Even offered to leave the county with her but she's... loyal to my brothers. I don't know that I can do anything about it. You can break her loose, that's what you can do about it. My brothers are no good. They're destroying themselves. They're destroying Laura and maybe you too, if you don't get away. But I... She's worth saving, Mr. Barlow. Believe me, she's worth saving. Take her away. She'll go with you. She's in love with you. Seems to me, this is something she should say for herself, Clint. What time is it? I don't know, but it's getting mighty late. Here they come. Let's get ready, boys. It's coming around the bend. Jake, take your men around the other end of the train. And be quiet. Come with me. Engineer! Stop the train. Open up or we'll blow it up! Come on! All right. Open. Bring out the cash box. Drop your guns. You're surrounded. That no-good Barlow is an agent. Lee! Get Claxton! I can't. I'm hit! Sim, they got Lee. Well, he never could shoot anyway. Frank, on your right. Pete, head towards Claxton. Come on, get that Barlow. Look out, Barlow! Throw that gun over here! All right, come out of there! Hands up! Come on! Sim? Sim, look, they got Frank. All right, they got him, shut up! No... We ain't got a chance here. I'm gonna give up. You what? Don't shoot! I give up. Come back here, you rat! Take him into town, boys. Come on... Why didn't you let me shoot the yellow belly? We're saving him and you. All right, take him off. Come on. Mosley, did you get the men with the horses? We got the lot. Poor Claxton. He didn't know how right he was when he called this a calculated risk. Lost a good man, Peterson. You'll get what you deserve! You people have no authority to do this! We'll show you who has the authority. This is imponderable. And they may get loose. They may indeed. Nobody knows what the Renos can do. We simply cannot take any more chances with them, not only for our own sakes, but for the sake of the whole state. All around us, other counties are decent and God fearing, while we have been notorious. This is not my idea... this is the idea of the majority of you. None of us is excited. None of us is hot-headed. This is something that has to be done. And done with as little compunction as you would kill a rattlesnake. Anybody got anything to say? As long as the Renos are left alive there's always the threat that we'll be terrorized again. I say it's come the time for us to make sure we can live the rest of our lives in peace and quiet. And to take some of the shame off Jackson County. Anything else? We've talked enough. Let's get the job done! It's now eleven o'clock. We'll leave right away. That should put us there by 3:00, while it's still dark. Come armed and with masks. Come on out of there! Come on! Laura? It had to happen whether they were your brothers or mine. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the real truth about myself. Oh, oh, oh, Jim! Who's in there? It's all right, Noah. You, Jim? Yeah. Well... Sounded like you were trying to get yourself some night owls. What's going on here? Whoa! Who is it? Clint, Mr. Euall, where's Barlow? He's here. Mr. Barlow... Laura... They're after Frank and the others. Who? Fisher and the mob. They're headed for North Vernon. Look after Laura. Oh, Clint, what happened? Fisher, Dedrick and Foley are the leaders, they've stirred up the whole town. Don't move. Raise your hands, Sheriff. Stand up. Don't reach for your gun. What do you want? We want the Reno brothers. You men got no right! Give us the keys. Give us the keys. Simmy. You hear that? We want the Reno brothers. We'll hang them... Yeah, yeah, I heard them. You men got no right-- Give us the keys. That's far enough. Hurry up, we haven't got all night. Which way? There. All right, take them out. Come on. All right, boys. No! No, you can't. Frank! Frank! This one next, men. Frank! You have a lot of guts to come out here. No! You got to give us a trial! No! No! No! No! Shut up! And stop begging like a yellow belly. All right, drag him out of there. I ain't forgot how to walk. Get your hands off of me. You keep out of this, Barlow. You're breaking the law, I'm going in. We're the law now. You're a mob. We're the citizens and we're going through with this. Shut up, you're making me sick. Frank! Get away from those ropes. Too late, Barlow. You want law and order? Is this the way to get it, with a mob? The Reno's are gonna be tried. Tried legal and proper. They're gonna be hanged. Now. Step-- Drop that gun, Barlow. Get on with it. I know you, Fisher, and you, Dedrick. If you hang these men-- All right, Fisher, who are the others? Dedrick, who were they? I don't like lynchers much better than I like outlaws. Put 'em in the Reno cells. It was worth it. After a few years behind the bars, maybe you'll change your tune. Mighty good shooting, Barlow. Sorry, Falon. Didn't do much good after all. You shouldn't have come here. I had to. I'm sorry, Laura, I tried. I know.
