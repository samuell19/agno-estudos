I can't believe they reopened that drive-in. I'm telling you, people are going to the movies more often now. I'm good, Jordan. Thanks. Somebody has to be responsible and get us home safely. Yeah, it's not often we see you two anymore since we moved to the middle of nowhere. It's a suburb, not another planet. In the middle of rush hour, I don't think you can tell the difference. Don't listen to him, Antonia. It's the perfect neighborhood to raise a family in. All thanks to you for finding this place online. See, my obsession with realty websites has finally come in handy. Oh, I'm sure being stuck in the suburbs with a minivan is the last thing Jordan expected when we met, so... At some point, I'll get used to the crickets chirping loudly all night. At least my kidnapper's a pretty good cook. Hey. I mean loving partner. Mmhmm. So when are you guys joining us married folks in the burbs? Well, if I could ever peel Pete away from work, we might finally pick a date and plan our wedding. I... I'm just trying to make sure we're not in debt for the rest of our lives when we decide to do so. You know how expensive weddings are these days? At this point, I would do it in the City Hall with a dog as our witness. There you go. Hey, I'm just saying, I want you to have the best, because you deserve the best. - Aw. - Aw. Resist as long as you can. Life's never the same after you say I do. Please, Jordan. You would still be wearing dirty gym shorts and drinking flat beer with your college roommates if Antonia hadn't had met you. Exactly. Yeah. Drive safe. Text us when you get home. I will. Bye. Yeah. Everything okay? Yup, everything's fine. What's wrong? Why can't we set a date? I just... I pictured myself married to you by now. It feels weird seeing our friends settled down who have been together for less time than us. You know I want that too, but we... I already told you, I don't want a huge wedding. Like I actually want a small wedding. You say that now. But what if you change your mind? I appreciate that. Maybe you don't want to marry me at all. You know that's not true. I don't know that. February 24th. You mean it? Yeah. Or any other day. Whichever one you prefer. I love you. I love you. I love you. Morning. Looks like you're off to the races. Morning. February's less than a year away. We should have started planning months ago. That's great. Actually, I've heard of this really great venue from one of my bridal groups and I was hoping maybe we could check it out today. I can't today. I have a new client, who thinks he needs more security than I recommended. Is somebody after him? No. He's a paranoid old rich guy. And my team takes good care of him. But I promise you I will be as involved with all this wedding stuff as I can be. Okay. We can try a different day. Love you, Laura boo. Bye, peach. Wait, a free wedding? Do they make you sign over your firstborn? I uploaded our pictures. I wrote this cute little intro. "Physical therapist meets handsome security specialist." You're insane. It's worth a shot. Okay, sure. All right, let me let you go. I'm about to walk into the house. Bye. We just won. We're getting our dream wedding. Okay. Peach, you here? Yes, love. What's up? All you have to do is say yes. This sounds like a trap. What am I agreeing to? So I entered a contest and we won. We won what? An all-expenses-paid wedding to be exclusively featured in Veil magazine and designed by the Wedding Whisperer. Think of all the money we'll save. And you'll barely have to do any of the planning. Come on. I never win anything. And this way, I'll get the wedding of my dreams. Which you said is your dream too, right? Right. So, can we do it? Yes. Sounds amazing. Okay, okay, okay. I have to go book our consultation. Our consultation? You guys must be our lucky couple. I'm Sarah, Faith's assistant. Let me walk you to her office. These designs are stunning. You should see the pictures from the wedding we just finished. Oh my gosh. So cool. Yeah. Looks good. And this is Faith. Laura, so lovely to meet you. We loved your submission. Oh my gosh. It's so lovely to meet you. I'm a huge fan. Pete, this is the Wedding Whisperer. You can call me, "Faith". It's less of a mouthful and frankly, more original. Hi Faith, I'm Pete. Nice to meet you. Pete, nice to meet you, too. Shall we get started? Yes, I have so many ideas. Um, oh, I'm so sorry. I'm going to have to take this. It's my clinic. It might be a patient. Trust me. I understand demanding clients. We'll wait for you to get started. Hi Andrew? Well, this is fun. I had no idea Laura entered your contest. And I had no idea I spent an entire weekend with an engaged man. But I guess it makes sense now why you ghosted me. Technically, Laura and I were on a break when we hooked up. It was more than just a hook-up. But we've fixed our issues and we've been great ever since. I can see why. Your fiancé is certainly a lovely woman. Please, don't say anything to her. She would be devastated. She's so excited to have you working with us. Is this gonna be some kind of conflict of interest? Listen, I'm not a lawyer, so this is not a conflict of interest. Trust me. The last thing I want to do is ruin my career over a hook-up. I'm here to do a job with a national sponsor. The last thing I want is conflict with my star couple. In the vault. What's in the vault? Pete's already coming up with ways to surprise you on your big day. Is he? He can be quite romantic when he wants to be. Sounds like it. So let's see what ideas you have in that scrapbook of yours. So how long have you been together? Officially, six years. We met in college. Wow, six years. That's a long time to hold out, Pete. You're lucky she stuck around. Well, we wouldn't have won this wonderful contest if we rushed into things earlier. So I know you were thinking February. But how do you feel about a summer wedding? I know it's soon, but you're going to love the ideas I've come up with. This summer? I know, but Veil magazine wants to feature you in their fall issue to drive up sales, so it's kind of a deal-breaker if you can't make it work. Do you think we can pull it together in a couple of months? Of course, we can. That's what I'm here for. Yes, ma. We are very excited. I... I don't know what to say. Is there a reason you're rushing into things? Something I don't know about? No, ma. We've been planning this for a while. When Laura won a free wedding, we said, why not? Nothing's free, honey. I was hoping you would join us for cake tasting and wedding dress shopping in a couple of weeks. We thought that since Laura's parents aren't... Well, we thought it would be a great way for you to be involved with our wedding and for you to spend some extra time with Laura. Of course, Pete. And thank you, Laura, for asking. I'd be honored to be a part of it. When? Our wedding planner is setting up all the details. And so we'll just get back to you with the dates as soon as we find out. A planner? Back in my day, we... Okay, ma. I love you, thanks. Got to go. We'll talk soon. I look forward to seeing you, Wendy. Bye. She hates me. No, she doesn't. She didn't even know my name for the first six months of our relationship. She is old. She is 60. And she still remembers your middle school crush's name. What can I say? We were so cute together. Oof. Well, I should call Faith and find out what's next on our wedding to-do list. Uh, yeah, sure. You think you should? Is everything okay? Of course. I just... I don't know. Do you get strange vibes from Faith? Faith? No. I mean, she's a little arrogant, but that's 'cause she's the best. What are you getting at, Pete? Nothing. It's all just happening really fast and I want to make sure that we're not being taken advantage of. But as long as my little queen is happy, I'm happy. Now, I know you were going for a more outdoorsy feel. But this place is the best. The modern touches are gonna photograph incredibly in the magazine. I don't doubt it. This space is beautiful. Um, I was hoping we could check out some other places? Truth is, given our timeline, there are very few options left worth seeing. What about that greenhouse we talked about? If you're willing to wait 18 months, I can definitely contact the GM. But we will lose Veiled's support and it will cost a bundle. What do you think? I just want you to be happy. If this isn't the right place, let's keep our options open. I would love to see what you can do with this space. Of course. Let me show you the grounds. You are going to love the textures on the stone house. Are you working? Just a few last minute emails. Mmhmm. Come on. You've got to check out the bridal suite. Faith. You're here really early. I threw together some things I found useful over the last couple of years. That's so kind of you. Uh, do you... Do you want to come up? I'd love to. It's important to remember to take care of yourself. It's easy to get lost in the maze of wedding planning. This is why you're the best at what you do. Here, let me get the uh, coffee going. Those are from our... Our trip last year. We're still paying for it, but it was really nice to reconnect. Will Pete be joining us today? Oh, we thought the one-on-ones were just that. So he booked client meetings for today. How accommodating. Open it up. It's a gift to use, not to stare at. Oh, I think these might be yours? Did they fall in by accident? No. Those are a secret hack I found out all models use for their big photo shoots. What for? They speed up your metabolism, so you can comfortably fit into your wedding dress. Or you can panic like most brides do and end up starving yourself the week before with little results. You know, I usually tell my patients not to use stuff like this. I take them myself. I mean, don't take more than two or three in a day, but that's just common sense. The last 5 pounds is always the hardest. Thank you. So I was meaning to ask, is Pete happy with you winning the contest? He still hasn't gotten back to me about booking a time. He is swamped with work. I'll just... I'll talk to him. I'll make sure that he reaches out and find the time. Thank you for meeting with me. Let's get this over as quickly and painlessly as possible. Relax, Pete. It's just business. Why are you sending me those photos? I need you to sign this. Thank you. What photos? Don't play coy. You know what I'm talking about. Honest, I don't. Really? Then who would send those? Is there anyone else that knows about us? Anyone that might be unhappy about your wedding? Okay. Why am I here? It's part of the process. It's supposed to be our chance to get to know each other, but I guess we're past that, aren't we? You don't know me. Well, I know that you have a cute little mole on your upper-right thigh. And I know that you talk in your sleep. And I found out the fun way that you have a dirty little mouth on you when you've had one too many whiskies. You're not going anywhere. Do you think that it's easy for me to plan the wedding of a man that rejected me? A man that I had genuine feelings for and was really hurt by when he just stopped talking to me? You think this is easy for me? What do you want from me? Respect, to start. Oh, my favorite. But I shouldn't with the big day coming up so quickly. Uh, says who? This is a celebration and you're not gonna let me eat this whole tub alone. Come on. Uh, you're a terrible friend. In the best way possible. Mmm. So um, what's this Wedding Whisperer like in person? Is she as cool as she is on her Instagram? Cooler. She's effortless. And um, you trust Pete with a cool, hot, famous person? What do you mean? I just don't wanna see him get cold feet and hurt you again, you know. That's all. Yeah, I trust him completely. Or I wouldn't be marrying him. Yeah, good. Good. Are you kidding me? Who would have done this? The cops wouldn't even come when I called. Honestly, it's probably just some kids messing around while their folks are asleep. Okay, I should probably go home and see Pete. I wanna hear all about his meeting with Faith. How'd it go? He didn't really say anything. All he said was that she loves us. I don't know. Wait, do you have a famous friend now? Do you want my autograph? I'm kidding. Okay, I'm going home. Thank you for helping me. Hey! What are you... Oh my, Faith. You scared me. I did. I'm sorry. It's only me. I'm sorry. What are you doing here? I thought... I thought we were meeting at the cake tasting. Well, we were. But I came to check on you after Pete told me what happened last night. Pete told you? My friend said there's never any vandalism in her neighborhood. Well, that's partly why I'm here. I think it might be a jealous fan. What? Why? I mean, did somebody say something? We've received some backlash from angry brides who didn't win after we announced you as the winner. I wanted to shield you from it, because I know how stressful weddings are. But now I feel like you should know. That's so creepy to think about. I should tell Pete. The cops didn't take it seriously last night. I wouldn't take it too seriously. Just probably some harmless internet trolls blowing off some wedding-fueled hormones. Maybe I should make my profile private. That will help. But I wouldn't be so cavalier with your posts. Anyone can clone your account and figure out where you live through landmarks and details. Hey. I was just going to go up, look for you. I wouldn't be too worried. Laura doesn't strike me as the runaway bride type. Ha! Well, don't we all have an appointment to get to? We do. Uh, Faith, do you want to come on up? I'm just gonna change and clean up, I'll... I'll just be a minute. Nice day, isn't it? I'm being cordial. You're the one acting like a child. Just be normal. Sorry about the wait. Ready? You look fabulous. Well, I do like the wine glasses. Look, these are all just ideas, but I was thinking that a white dance floor might make a really nice contrast with all the warm wood in the hall? It does. And that's why people do it all the time. And we can do that if that's what you want. Oh, well, what do you really think? I'm paid to innovate not replicate. I like where your head's at, but I think we can do better. Imagine a variation of that, but with black and white squares, like a chess board. Babe, you've wanted that floor since we started planning this thing. I mean, maybe she's right. If our wedding is gonna be on display, why not try something unique? You are late. Hi Wendy, sorry. It was my fault, ma. Wendy, please meet Faith, our wedding planner. Nice to meet you, Wendy. Your punctuality is appreciated. Pleasure. Let me check on the cake ETA. Faith. Just who I was looking for. Thought our appointment was at 1:00. It is, but they arrived early. Where's the lemon tort? They wanted all three options to try. I can bring one right out, but it's gonna take a moment. Thank you. We'll start with these. These look amazing. They certainly are lovely. Which one should we try first? I'm easy. They'll all get eaten eventually. Whoever said save the best for last has never tried triple-layer chocolate cake. Wow. Do I even need to try anymore if I already know which one I want? Let it out. Oh, I feel so embarrassed. Don't be. Who knows what it is? Maybe it's a 24-hour bug. I felt fine this morning. Are you pregnant? Okay. How's she doing in here? I think she's got most of it out but we need to figure out what we're doing about the tasting. The food should be out soon. Reschedule it. Problem is, chef's doing me a favor. They're booked solid all year. So if we cancel now, they will not have enough time to prep all the options before the big day. We can't cancel it, Pete. There's no point in staying if you can't hold food down. Pete, Wendy and I could go and bring back the best plates to try at home? I don't think that's a good idea. This... this is all about what Laura wants. Please, Pete. Stay. Enjoy it fresh and bring me back your favorites. I'll take a taxi home. It'd be a shame to lose them. They're the best in the business. Please, honey. And that wasn't so bad now, was it? It's a shame Wendy had to leave. Those dang cats and their need to be fed. I did this for my wife. Technically, you're not married yet. What makes her so special? I can't do this again. She's oblivious. Anyone that reads Veiled Magazine is desperately seeking approval and validation from others. Trust me. It's how I make a living. Don't you want someone with a little bit more agency? Someone who has the confidence to accept you for who you are. Pete, it's not a competition. I've had feelings for you from the moment I met you and they haven't gone away since. Let's give this a shot. Please. You don't get to walk away from me again. Not again. What do you want? For me to leave Laura? I want you to take responsibility for your actions. Don't you wanna meet your daughter? So what made you finally decide to pick a date? Laura gave us the push we needed by winning that competition. So you wouldn't have done it so soon if it was up to you? No, ma. We've been planning this for a while. It was gonna happen sooner or later. Then why'd you wait so long in the first place? We were saving up. Hey. That wedding planner, Faith, she is really something else. She has excellent taste. Sorry about yesterday. At least, I'll be a little thinner for my dress fitting. Hmm. Bad joke. Us women have always got to maintain our physique. Not just when we're getting married. So what do you think? I think you look stunning. But then again you'd look great in a garbage bag. What do you think, Wendy? It's not the right cut for you. What... what do you mean? Well, first, tell me what you like about it. Well, I like that it's classic. That it's not too showy, but still sort of elegant. That's the issue. You're hiding behind it. I want you to try this one on again. I felt naked in that. I'd wear that one if I had the body. You have to be comfortable in it, Laura. And you're the one wearing it all day. Did you think I can pull it off? Weddings are fairy tales that come alive, not images set by previous purity-driven generations whose photos we look at now and gasp wondering who styled them. You deserve to be the bride you've always wanted to be. Honestly, I didn't love this dress. I just... I felt like a blimp in it. Don't let your insecurities drive your decision-making. If you don't like the cut, I'll join you on your runs. I'll help you lose the last 5 pounds. Okay, I... I'm gonna be the voice of reason here and say that she doesn't need to lose 5 pounds. Who are you kidding? We all could. Except her. Wendy, would you mind joining me in the dining hall? Love to. So, how are we feeling about today? Good. I think this is the one. You sure? Why? You don't like it? It's just... I wanna make sure you want it, not everyone else. Faith definitely had opinions she wasn't scared of sharing. I kind of like that she's pushing me out of my comfort zone. As long as you're okay with where she is pushing you. Yeah, I think she's great. And the wedding is gonna look amazing. I could have never done it without her. Hmm, Laura... you are a strong, capable woman. I don't want you to forget that. Now, come on, bridezilla. Let's get you out of this dress. Hey, you were not a peach at your wedding either. Wow, okay. So how was it actually? It was good. Your mom nearly ripped a dress right off me, but other than that, everybody got along. I feel like I barely see you anymore. Oh, I don't wanna interfere with yours and Faith's planning. It's not interfering. You're my partner in this. I want you to be involved. I want you to be happy with our choices, too. Didn't you sell me on this, that I wouldn't have to lift a finger? I was being facetious. I want you to be involved, as much as you wanna be. Things have just been really crazy with work. I'm trying to get ahead on a bunch of stuff, so that after the wedding we can take time for the honeymoon. You're acting like this is a prison sentence, not a celebration. That's not what I meant. Well, I'm going to go pack for my bachelorette weekend. I'm excited to marry my best friend. Yeah. Hi Pete. Laura. Hi! Okay, surprise. Oh yikes. Do I really have to wear this? Kitsch is part of the fun. But yeah, it is pretty tacky, isn't it? I think you should keep it on. Why is that? Because it advertises that you're already taken. So I like it. Actually it's not until she says, I do. So you better be on your best behavior while we're gone. What are you up to while we're gone? Big night with the boys? Something like that. Probably just gonna get a few drinks with Jordan. Not much of a big partier. I like to save my energy for the main event. Ooh, boring and dumb. Responsible. This is what I love about him. I love you. Try to have fun. Yeah. You don't think it's weird she's coming? Faith? No, why? I mean, she's not your friend. She's doing a job. We're friends. I feel like we've gotten close through this process. Plus, no one else could come with such short notice. I guess. Give her a chance. I will, if she can hang. Not bad, huh. Nice spot, Antonia. Good find. Thanks. This is why she's my maid of honor. Learned a few things about you over the years. It's good to keep people like you around. Keeps her grounded. I think I'm pretty down to earth. Ah, just wait until those promotional offers start pouring in. It's easy to believe in your own hype when free flights and sponsored posts are influencing your decision-making. Or an all-expense-paid wedding. I have no idea what you're talking about. Antonia, could you bring my bag to my room, please? Ladies, wanna join me on a run? There are some trails in the welcome packet. Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna settle in and crack open a bottle of wine. Laura, you want a glass? Well, I think I'm gonna go with Faith. Actually, I have a little bit of work to do before the big day. Oh my gosh. If you get any more fit, I'm gonna look like a whale next to you. Come on. That's what photo editing is for, honey. Knock, knock. I thought we were going for a run. We are. We should toast to the event first. Ah-ah. No wasting. It will make the run less painful. Let's do this. You okay? Yeah, I just got dizzy for a second. You should go. I... I um... I don't wanna... I don't wanna mess with your time. You sure? Yeah. Okay. I'll see you at home. Ah! Oh my God, it's you. I was worried sick. I'm glad you're okay. I just... I don't know what happened. I felt great when we left. Have you eaten anything? Yeah, a bit. I had those diet pills you gave me. Could they have expired or... Where did you get them? You can't drink alcohol on them. Had I known you'd taken them I would have never brought you the champagne. I'm so sorry. No, no. Don't be. I should have asked. Laura, where have you been? Faith said you were right behind her. Oh, I just couldn't keep up with her in the woods. Uh-huh. Well, it's refreshing to know you aren't the best at absolutely everything. Now, come on. I got some drinks waiting for us. Oh actually, I want to take it easy tonight. I just need to relax. Aren't you a bag of fun? Do you want more water? Sure, thanks. Well, it looks like I'm the only one celebrating you tonight. Cheers. I promise, I'm gonna be more fun tomorrow. Yeah, sure. Maybe we should call it a night. Yeah, okay. I can... I can take a hint. Miss Perfect Faith never spills her drink. She didn't mean that. It's okay. I'm a new person in your life. That can be threatening to some people. Tell me about it. What am I missing? It's nothing. Pete was acting weird this morning. How so? I just have this eerie feeling like I did before we separated. Separated? I... I didn't know that. Nobody actually knows about it except Antonia. It was only a couple of days. What happened, if you don't mind me asking? I had just had a miscarriage. And I was depressed with all the hormones and we had a series of arguments. I didn't tell him about the baby. We were just arguing over all the usual things. Are we growing together or apart? Or is this even what we wanted, and... Why didn't you tell him about your pregnancy? It was early. I wanted to be sure. And we were going through a rough patch and I didn't want to use a baby to resolve it. Did you think there was someone else? I don't know. How'd you work things out? He woke up one day, came home and told me that he only wanted to be with me. We had great make-up sex and did a bit of counselling. The rest is history. I wish I got in the memo that we were dressing up. You look great. Oops. I thought I told you. Or maybe I told my assistant to tell you? Who knows? We're just going to whatever little bar this town has to offer anyway. You look very rustic. - Rustic? - Exactly. I'm sure you'll fit right in. Laura, truth or dare? I know death, but it can flow It's in my hands to hold With all the things I do Your love will see me through Will love to hear your call Can take that to the wall Woah, woah And then I'll take the world Woah, woah If you be talking about Put out a long stop Doesn't matter You are fearless. You can't get what you don't take. Yeah, not exactly a Vegas night, but he won't be telling his wife what you were whispering in his ear. Who's next? Antonia. Truth or dare? Truth. Take these first. Is it true that you've been jealous of me and Laura's relationship ever since we met? That's... That's not a real question. Of course, she's not. Just kidding. Well, jealousy isn't the word I'd use. It's a joke. We're having fun. You know what? I think I better get out of here. Otherwise, I'm gonna end up calling her a bitch. Oh, I just did. She's kidding. Who even are you? She's my friend. No. No, she's not. She came out of nowhere and started controlling your... Your every move. Honestly, it's gotten so hard to watch. I barely recognize you right now. You're the one who's acting weird. I'm sick of making excuses for my moody best friend. Yeah? Well, I'm sick of you ogling over some D-list celebrity just because she's doing her job? You're not gonna ruin my wedding. It's my day. You're ruining your own day. And I can't stand to watch it anymore. Well, maybe you should go home. Yeah, I think I will. Hey, cowboy. Another two. Weddings bring out the worst in people. Now we can lick our wounds or we can remember why we're here. Celebrating you. Babe, I'm coming. I left my wallet on my desk. It's here. I'll be right there. Hello? Gabby? Eve? Truth or dare? Dare. I dare you to seduce the bartender. You don't have to sleep with him. You just have to make him believe that he can. What are you waiting for? This is my new friend, Steven. He works here. He's not a real cowboy. Grew up on a ranch, though. So the hat's just a conversation starter. It worked. I am getting married. You mentioned that. Wanna get out of here? Let's keep this party going. Where... where am I? Exactly where you're supposed to be. Tell me nothing happened last night. Nothing happened last night. What did I do? Whatever you did or didn't do is safe with me. Is he still here? Who? Your friend, Cowboy Steve? No. He left before I woke up. Probably had some cattle to wrangle. Did I... Listen, it's your bachelorette. I'm sure Pete's had some crazy nights he'd rather forget, too. I don't believe it. I don't remember anything from last night. Why are you in such good condition? Blessed with a good liver, I guess. He left you a note. "Thanks for a great time. Steve." Oh, what am I gonna tell Pete? Nothing. I'm an awful liar. Confessions are good for a guilty conscience. But they destroy the receiver. Look, you love Pete and Pete loves you. If you told him, it would tarnish your relationship forever. Do you want that? Of course not. Okay. Then bury it. And learn from it. What could I possibly learn from this? Maybe there's a subconscious reason that you were even willing to go there with someone else. Oh. It's not an excuse. Nobody's perfect, Laura. I've always had this nagging feeling that he cheated on me while we were apart. But I thought you said the thought never crossed your mind and then you patched everything up when you got back together. We did. But he changed after that weekend. He was more loving. Paying attention to more details. And that's a bad thing? Like he keeps trying too hard. Trying to make up for something. Did you ever ask him about it? No. I left it. But every once in a while, the thought comes back into my head. Thanks for listening. Guess I had to get that off my chest. Of course. I just want the best for you. Let me get your bags, babe. You okay? I'm... just a fun weekend. I'm really tired. Head up. I want to talk to Faith about something. What? You want to know all the dirty little secrets of the weekend? I'm sure Laura will tell me all the highlights. I wouldn't be so sure. I'm not worried. Maybe you should be. I'm gonna go upstairs. And we're gonna keep pretending everything is all right until this is over. Pete, do you really wanna marry a cheater? Then again, you'd both be living a lie, so maybe there's something poetic about that. No, the only liar here is you. You don't have a child, let alone mine. You don't know what I've been through for you. I know you've been stalking us. I know you planned this from the start. I have evidence. So I'm done playing your games. Consider this your notice. You're fired. I don't think you wanna do that. If you fire me, I'll show this to the police and have you charged with breaking and entering. Maybe I'll throw an assault charge on there and see who comes out on top? Your word against mine, right? You're insane. I'm doing what I have to for my client and her wedding. You really shouldn't throw around accusations like that. Especially when your own house is on fire. I just feel sorry for you. But don't say I didn't try and warn you. Call me when you change your mind about her again. You okay? Big night? Probably a couple too many chardonnays. And the vodka shots didn't help. Sounds fun. Any stories you wanna share? Nothing I'm proud of. Is that so? Antonia and I had a blowout. I don't think she's gonna be coming to the wedding. What do you mean? I mean, she's been acting weird ever since we announced the date, like she's jealous or something. And then she ended up telling me off about it and she hasn't messaged me back since. Well, did you try messaging her? She's the one who lost it on me at my party. It was embarrassing and insulting. I mean, Faith saw everything. Well, was there any truth to what she said? Why would you even suggest that it's okay for my friend to hurl personal attacks at me? Aren't you supposed to be on my side? You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Maybe throwing out a friendship over a fight that was clearly fueled by alcohol isn't the way you wanna go with this. Yeah, well, she has to reach out to me first. End of story. Dinner's ready. I'm not hungry. Go ahead. Still nothing from Antonia? She is so stubborn. I don't know how Jordan puts up with her sometimes. Mm, I'm sure it will work itself out. In the meantime, I cooked us something special, 'cause I thought it'd be nice to spend some time together. Are you sucking up to me? I'm trying to be nice. And it's gonna get cold. You're being weird. Pete, it's so beautiful. I didn't even know you had it in you. Just 'cause you're not seeing doesn't mean I'm not trying. Hmm. Oh, I don't think I could ever drink again. I think you should have a glass with me. What's going on? There's something I want to talk to you about. Um, you know, whatever it is, I know we can fix it. You remember last year... when we were working on our issues, but we just kept making things worse? Yeah. We came back stronger. But I wasn't completely honest with you when I came back. While we were on our break, I met someone. What do you mean you met someone? We were only apart for a few days. It didn't mean anything and it only lasted those few days. So you were... You spent the entire weekend with someone else while I was crying at home and wondering what was wrong with me? I'm so sorry, Laura. It was a stupid decision. I was drinking too much and I was hurt. Technically, we were separated. And it meant nothing. Why are you telling me this? I didn't... I didn't want to hurt you, or us. The whole affair made me realize how important you are to me and how stupid I was acting. It took stepping away from you to realize how much I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. Get away from me. I'm not done. No, I don't want to hear any more. My affair was with Faith. I didn't even know her name. At the time, I never thought I would come across her again. But then we went for that introduction. I didn't know what to do, You were so happy to have her. And then, she started blackmailing me. How come... I think she set us up to win her contest to get back at me. How could you keep this from me this whole time? I'm sorry. I didn't wanna hurt you. Please. Don't touch me. Laura, come back! Antonia. Pick up. Antonia. I... I... I need to talk to you. Come on. Come on. Ma'am, are you okay? Ooh. How are you? I'm fine. Just a little banged up. Peach, Pete, there's something I have to tell you. I love you. I wanna be with you. That's all that matters. Even if I think I cheated on you? What do you mean you think you did? I... I don't... I don't remember. The whole weekend was such a blur and I got really drunk with Faith after Antonia left and I woke up half naked to a goodbye note from some guy we met. She already told me you slept with someone. And I don't believe her. We can't trust anything she says. You've got to be kidding me. Leave it, Laura. She's dangerous. Laura, be careful! Get out of here. What's going on? You're fired. I don't know what he told you, Laura, but I'm your friend. Friends don't sleep with their friends' fiancés. In fairness, we did it to each other. And let me remind you. This is a business relationship. Check your contract. Section 10. Failure to fulfil your duties will trigger a total repayment of my time and cost incurred to date. You're not getting a dime from us. I'm calling the police. Don't bother, I'm leaving. Where are you going? To find out the truth. Hey, look who's back. Woah. How could you do that to me? Do what? You knew I was drunk. Way too drunk to consent to anything. What? Nothing happened between us. I... I thought something would, but after you passed out at that house, your friend took me to her bedroom and... So you're saying you and I didn't... No. Are you okay? Is there a flower shop in this town? I'm so sorry about everything. Me too. Antonia okay? I want you to know that I forgive you. We were both keeping secrets and they ate at our relationship. If something happened between you and that guy, I don't care. We can work it out. Nothing happened. She was lying. What secret are you talking about then? I was pregnant before we separated. And I lost the baby, and it crushed me. I tried to control everything in my life, including you. We were gonna have a baby? I um... I miscarried at six weeks. Then I just... I pushed you away. I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you. There's no one else I wanna spend the rest of my life with, Laura. Yeah. Me either. Does this mean you still wanna go through with our wedding? You may now kiss the bride. Thank you for making me the luckiest man in the world. Mm, it's dry. I like it. Mr. and Mrs. Peter Wynn. Laura Wynn, I love the sound of that. Oh, what's that? Your knee again? I just need to sit down. Pete! Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete! He's none of your concern. What did you do to him? You did this to him. You're insane. I'm a successful businesswoman. I'm the one that deserves him. I'm the one he loves. Whatever you think happened between you two is no reason to do this. Initially, I only wanted to meet you. I wanted to see what you had that I didn't. Then I met you. And after being thoroughly underwhelmed, I figured if Pete and I could reconnect, then maybe he would be reminded of what drove him into my arms in the first place. When it was clear he wasn't gonna leave you, well, I had to take matters into my own hands. I know him better than he knows himself. Put this on him. Let's go. There are guests staying nearby. You're going to be seen. If you leave now, this will all be over. Get up. Whatever you think you can do with that pen, my bullet is faster. Now, start writing. What am I supposed to say? The truth. Say you fell in love with a bartender named Steven after an incredible night with him. That's a lie. Write it. And make it convincing. Say you thought you knew what you wanted, but you found love with someone else. And you're leaving. I'm not going to say that. Write it or I'll kill you and make your new husband bury you. "I can't bear to go on like this. So I'm doing the only thing that makes sense and moving across the country. Don't contact me. I've seen the way you look at Faith. And I know you two are a better fit for each other." Very convincing. You might wanna be nice. I would hate for your last moments alive to be painful. Faith, let her go. Don't do this. We can be together. I don't want you. Pete, baby. Stay with me. 911. What's your emergency? I need an ambulance at 4312 West, Highway 11. I have a man with a gunshot wound to the shoulder and a woman with a severe head injury. Did you have any trouble getting it? No. Guy I used to work with who's in evidence now signed off on it for me. No questions asked. This is gonna be a weird anniversary. - Hey girl. - Hi. You're just gonna leave it here? I'm gonna bury the past.
