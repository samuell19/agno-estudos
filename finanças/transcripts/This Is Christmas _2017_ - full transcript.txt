Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (metal banging) - You know what they say, they say like when a man's dream, when he doesn't fulfill his dream, he runs to get married and have kids 'cause that's an easy thing to succeed in. - Guys, Jesus. No, I like being a dad, you know, as you open up the diaper and there'd be like colored Play-Doh in the diaper. - [Light-Haired Man] That's disgusting. - [Dark-Haired Man] And then let 'em grow up and leave the house. Fuck it, save some money. - My keys, did I leave my keys over there? - Did you lose your keys again? - I just walked out right now. I asked for a drink that I haven't gotten yet and I'm still... (chattering) - [Mustached Man] It's a daiquiri. (laughing) - Actually, I would. - Do you serve daiquiris here? - [Mustached Man] That's kind of, like, forbidden. Well, without the umbrella, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Ah. (laughing) - [Mustached Man] Here, here, try that, I think that's light. - You gotta know how to pour, dude. - [Mustached Man] I think that's lead in there. - I've seen head like this before. (laughing) - [Mustached Man] You've given head like that. - [Curly-Haired Man] All right, hey, slow down, guys. Slow down. (cheering and applause) - [Light-Haired Man] He'll drink anywhere. - [Friend] Give him a reason. - Salud. - Good game. (train whistle blowing) (pleasant music) ♪ Woo ♪ - I lied to you, Dennis. I'm not really pregnant. - [Dennis] You lost it? - [Girlfriend] No, I never really had it. - [Dennis] What are you saying? - I was scared that you weren't gonna marry me. I was afraid that you were gonna leave me. (sobbing) I didn't know what else to do. (metal banging) You're the love of my life. I'll never love anybody else. (booming) (pleasant music) - [Friend] Come on, where the hell is Dennis? - [Light-Haired Man] He'll be here. - He'll be here, man. - Dennis. - [Curly-Haired Man] I've called him three times and he hasn't gotten back. - Really? That's not like him. - He'll be here, man, relax. - Now, tonight? - I have to leave. - What are you gonna tell the kids? - Lies. - [Wife Voiceover] Another woman? - [Dennis Voiceover] No. - [Wife Voiceover] How will you survive? - [Dennis Voiceover] That's what I have to find out. - Don't start that now. - [Light-Haired Man] This is your first drink of the day. - Hey, man, what the hell, where you been? You're late for practice. Come on, let's go. - Let's do this. - Come on, come on, here. - Hey, whoop, whoop, water, water. Oh, sorry, I was a little selfish. Sorry, man. - [Light-Haired Man] Thanks, Harry. - Hey, Dennis, what the hell, man? - I just want to love somebody before I die. (ominous whispering) (ominous tones) - [Dark-Haired Man] Jesus, didn't you see it coming? - You had three kids with her. Three. - Yeah. - I mean... (giggling) (radio chatter) - Fuck. - [Harry] I called the house and the phone was disconnected. - I'm moving. - What, you think I wouldn't find you or my son? - Your son is (speaking in foreign language). - What, you've been here long enough, why don't you speak a little English? - No, you still wouldn't understand, asshole. - Where are you taking Jonah? You hear me? Where you taking Jonah? - To your parents' place, Harry, we're both moving in with them. - What, to my parents'? - Mm-hmm. - All right, he's not living with those people. - Well, Jonah loves those people, even if you don't. So you have no say in it. Do you understand me? - Listen. - Go ahead, hit me. Hit me. Come on, come on. Fucking hit me. I will have your ass arrested. - He's not being raised by a Jew, you hear me? He's not being raised by a Jew. (ominous whispering) - Why'd you have 'em if you didn't love her? - I don't know. We were married. The sex was good and I love my kids. - You gotta love the mother, Dennis. - [Girlfriend] This is me when I sang in the church choir at St. Gregory's. And this is me in college when I ran the gas station. - [Dark-Haired Man] Wow, great legs. You had them then and you got 'em now. (sweet music) (giggling) - You love me. - Not yet. - When? - I don't know. Show me some more clippings. Ow. - I want to move into your place. - I don't know. I got like a one year rule, you know? - What? - You gotta be with me one year to meet my kids. We've been together three months. What, are you crazy? - No, you are. Do you know how many men I could have? - Based on your marital scorecard, and your traveling scrapbook, and your weaker right hand, me and Larry King. What? - Wise-ass. - Sweet-ass. (giggling) - Come on, Jimmy. Your kids would love me. - Yeah, but will you love the kids? - Yes. Yeah. When can I meet them? - As soon as I know that we're for real. - We are for real. - Okay, all right, all right, nine months from now. Nine months from now. - Nine months? Oh my god, nine months? If, if. - If I'm still traveling up these legs to Never Neverland. - This is not about my cunt. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Sorry? Sorry? - I'm sorry, baby. What did I say? Come here. Come on. - No, no. - Don't-- - It's not about my cunt. Do you get that? - Yeah, I got it. Don't. Don't make a scene, sit down. - No. - [Jimmy] You know I love you. (giggling) (playful screaming) (thunder rumbling) - I need to talk to you. Hey, can you hear me? Psh. (sighing) I need to talk. (growling) (screaming) - [Jimmy] A mistake. I speak. - I'm serious. - What time is it? - It doesn't matter what time it is. - Focus, focus. - Hey. I want to sleep at your place. When do we get to do that? (chuckling) - Soon, Dina, soon. - What's so funny? It's not funny. I'm serious, come on. I mean, it's been, what, a year? Remember our little deal, our little bet? You said one year. What, are you bored with me? - No, I'm not bored. It's just that you're gonna meet my kids. You know? - What are you afraid of? I don't bite. - Yeah, but my daughter does. - I think I can handle her. I swear. (chuckling) - I love you. All right, let me try it again. I love you. (laughing) I love you. I love you. - [Dina] I love you too. (ominous whispering) - Yeah, you're one to talk, Jimmy. - Oh, like you love D's mother? Please, we're all in the same boat. - Excuse me, but I love, present tense, love Amelia's mother. - Which one? The real one? Or that mother you're having the problems with? - Women are supposed to know this. - Oh, that's a myth. How the hell am I supposed to know? Jordan, if you remember rightly, you and Steve both gave me sperm because you didn't wanna know who the father was. (sighing) What does your lawyer say? (chuckling) - Take a DNA test. Whoever is the biological father will probably get custody. Probably. - Well, hallelujah. There's your answer. - That's what I'm afraid of. What do I do if I lose her? (ominous whispering) - Dennis, how you think the kids are gonna handle it? (train whistle blowing) - I don't know. It's crazy. I don't know. - Pass the ball. - Watch the pass. - [Dennis] Hey, Ben. Ben. There you go, pass it to Ben. Drive it in, drive it in, Ben. - [Jimmy] Don't hog the ball. Pass the ball. (grunting) - Hey hey hey hey hey. - Come on, what are you doing? - You gonna call that? That's a foul. What the hell was that? - Just keep Ben over there. - Come on, Ben. - What the hell are you doing? We got kids here. - [Harry] You don't like D sitting with his mom? - On his goddamn side. She brings my son to my game, sitting on his side, rooting for him. - What, why you looking at me? Why you looking at me? - Come on, you know Demetrius isn't rooting for him. - I don't want him around my kid. - So what are you gonna do, kill him? - Don't make me have to arrest your ass for murder. - I'm all right. - Are you okay? Your son is up here. That's what you want to show him. You wanna show him that? Why don't you grow up? - All right, just tell Angela to have Demetrius sit with Victoria and Amelia, it's a simple solution. All right, come on. - Right now I'm a simple solution-- - [Jordan] All right, let's take 10. - To anything, goddammit. (rock music) (baby crying) Demetrius, stay close. Now. (baby screaming) Damn you. - I hate you. - [Ben] Bailey. Stop, stop. Whoa. - [Driver] God, I'm so sorry. I didn't see him. - [Ben] Jeez, shit. Where is he going? Demetrius. D. Where are you, boy? - I'll call in a critical missing, he can't have gone far. No, sit tight, I'll get a car to you, okay? - D. Dammit, Demetrius, where are you? D. Come here, boy. Demetrius. - Son, is your name Demetrius Stoler? Your father's looking for you. - No. I hate him. - [Announcer] Dr. Johnson, extension 251, please. Dr. Johnson, extension 251. (pleasant music) (sighing) (sighing) - Last time we were here, you were waiting for me. - And Amelia. - Of course. - That's what she meant, Steve. - Then say what you mean. - Steve, I'm sorry about this. - You're not the one who should be sorry. He is. - For what? - Not saying what you mean. (speaking in foreign language) - I just can't believe that you would do this for us. - I must love you guys very, very much. Either that or I'm crazy. (chuckling) - Not as much as I love you. - Oh god, get a room. (laughing) - Oh, stop right there. Hold on. - So, who's the father? - Damned if I know. (laughing) Come here. - [Jordan] Thank you. Oh my god. Oh, here. Okay, smile. Smile. - Smile big. Quick. It's perfect. (pleasant music) Can't you wait? - This was your idea. Don't give me any shit. - Can we try and be civil about this? - [Doctor] Ms. Kent. The report you requested. - Give her a minute to look at it, Steve. - He has a right. - Is this definitive? - Oh yes. There's no question about the DNA reading. - Steve. - Let him go. (pounding drums) (slow jazz music) - Jesus Christ, Dennis, that's cold water. You okay? - I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. - Man, who the hell does? We've all been through it. We still don't know shit. - Leave it alone. - It's freezing. You looking for punishment or what? - If anybody could make it work, I always figured it would be me. - Yeah, well join the crowd. None of us expected to be in this shit. - [Dennis] I failed, dammit. - [Ben] Dennis, we all failed. - Not Jimmy. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Jimmy cheated. On both his wives. - Yeah, you never did. - Could you take care of the babysitter? I don't want Reese to see me like this, okay? - I know, honey. Can you make it upstairs? - [Wife] Oh yeah, just put my hand on the banister. Oh jeez. Whoa. (grunting) (sighing) (toilet flushing) (jazz music) (giggling) - You gotta hurry up, she's gonna be here in a few minutes. - I have to pee first. - [Jimmy] No, just hold the pee and cum. - What if I can't? - It's all right, I like mixed drinks. - [Dina] Jeez, give me a chance. - [Jimmy] Come on, button up, button up. - Dammit, I'm dripping. I'm dripping. - Okay, hang on, hang on. Okay. Hey, babe. Grace, Dina, Dina, Grace. - Hi, I'm really happy to meet you. - You're so pretty. Why are you going out with my dad? - I like him. He's a good man. - He's a cheater. You know about his affairs with the third woman? - [Dina] Yeah, he's told me. - [Grace] And you still wanna go out with him? - You know, people change. Besides, if he ever does it again, he knows I'll fucking kill him. - You're so skinny. - [Dina] Oh, I used to be anorexic. - Jesus, do we have to talk about everything the first night? - Where's the pain in the ass? - Joey's at his mom. I figured, you know, Dina wouldn't stand a chance with both of you here at the same time. - She looks like she can take it. - Thanks, Grace, that's what I tried to tell him. (giggling) Do you have any panty liners? - I like you. Don't let my dad give you any of his shit. - Jesus, I'm right here. - Don't worry, Grace, I know all the tricks. - My dad's been divorced twice. - Me too. Three times. - Three times? - Mm. - Did you leave or did they leave you? - I left. I left. I'll be right back. (jazz music) - Jesus, I hope so. - This one's got your number. - This is Dennis. (cheering) (yelling) - [Dennis] Gentlemen. Way to go, Ben. - Slap of the bull, slap of the bull. - [Dennis] Come on in, guys, drink up. - Hey, that three-pointer, come on. - That was nice. - That was good. - [Ben] Hey, man, I thought you quit. - [Dennis] Well, I did. - Let me have one of those, will you? - [Jordan] Hey, I thought you quit. - I did. - [Jordan] Okay fine, well then 30 feet out. - [Ben] Dennis, you gotta stop worrying about your weight. - You can't worry about your weight and own this restaurant. Not allowed. - Beer, beer, beer? - Yeah, please, everybody. - [Jimmy] Oh shit, that was good. - Oh, man. - I wish I could dunk. - [Ben] Oh, you can dunk. - You just gotta lose about 15 of those and you can get off the ground more than a foot and a half. - Salud. - Good game, good game. - Thanks, for the drink. - Oh shit, sorry. - Yeah, no no, it's fine. - [Dennis] I got it. - I see where I'm not wanted. - He's a cop, dude. - Harry, try this. - [Jimmy] Back me up. - [Dennis] I'll give you this Belgian beer. - He'll drink anything. - Yeah, give him a reason. - You gotta start trimming the pubes, you know? - What? - Yeah. Pubes. Trim. - No, you're like selling your house. You gotta cut all the bushes back. Hey, first impressions are everything, Harry. (laughing) I'm serious. - [Harry] Jordan is cut off. No more of this talk. - No, no no no no no no, I'm serious. Hey, hey. - Yes, yes. - Not only that, when you do trim it back, it makes it look like they're getting more for their money, you know? - Oh, the illusions. - That's actually not a bad idea. - Yeah, it works. - We're all the same, we're all the same. - Six inches becomes seven real quick. - Right. You start smoking. You can't sleep anymore. You start to feel like shit. It's all the same. And then what? You're looking for a place to live. - Oh man, you never did that. That's the only guy I know with a woman who moved out. - Because they didn't want to return to the scene of the crime, dammit. (laughing) - So what do I do now, geniuses? (heavy exhale) - Whatever comes next. - Dennis, sorry I'm late. - No, that's okay. I just got here myself. - Have any trouble getting in? - No, the doorman just let me right in. - Good, good. Well, I was at a business lunch at your restaurant again. - Excellent. - I cannot tell you how easy it is to close a deal with a man after a good steak. - Oh, I think I do. - And a few martinis. (laughing) - Well, we do what we can. - Well, it's time to return the favor. So, what do you think of it so far? It's better than the others. - Hey (sighing) I'm sorry I've been such a pain in the ass about this whole thing. - Honey. You have been a piece of cake compared to most divorced men. - Separated. We're not divorced. Yet. - Right, right. I'm sorry, Dennis. I didn't mean anything personal by that. - No, that's all right. - So, what do you say we start with the upstairs, huh? - Okay. - I have a feeling this one might be special. It just might do it for ya. - Yeah. (jazz music) - Take a risk. This place is perfect for you. Come take a closer look. - Ow. - Oh. Oh. Are you hurt? Are you hurt? - Ow. - What are you doing? - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-- - Of course you meant to. (giggling) No no no, don't rip it. I got another meeting at three. Stand up. Stand up. (moaning and giggling) Here you go. Let me up, let me up, let me up. Yeah. Hang on. (moaning) (giggling) - I'm sorry. - Yeah yeah yeah, that's okay. That's all right, that's all right, that's fine. Oh yeah, honey. That's right. Yes. Yes. (groaning and moaning) So what do you think? - I didn't mean to... - The apartment. It's a find. - Oh. Yeah, no, it's great. Well, it's more than I want or need, but yeah. It's great. - It's yours if you want it. - I'll take it. (somber piano music) (shushing) - Hey, hey, you should just sleep here, okay? I have plenty of room. You're exhausted. - No, I hate that drive in the morning. I really hate that drive. Bye. (laughing) What? - Shoes? - [Victoria] Oh. Okay. Hell, I don't know where they are. I don't know where they are. - [Jordan] Amelia's room, I will check. - Okay, okay. - Hey, thank you so much for watching her tonight. - Are you kidding me? She's an angel. - Yeah. Probably gets that from you. - [Victoria] No, she gets that from you. - Steve, maybe. After all, she did spend a lot more time with him than me. - You know what, she's still gonna see him. Just not all-- - He's moving to Boston. - What? - Yup. - [Victoria] When did that happen? - Yesterday. Took the job with First National. No more working out of the house. He'll have to be onsite starting next week. - Wow. - [Jordan] Yeah. - Well, um, I guess that's something you're gonna have to deal with, I mean, one way or another, right? - Yeah. - She's your responsibility now. You're like the mom and the dad. Mm. (sighing) What? What? - You're the mom. - Oh no no no no. - [Jordan] I'm just saying (sighing) it's true. - Yeah, technically. Technically it's true. This is where I go, now. Suddenly, I'm awake. - [Jordan] Victoria. - [Victoria] Get all that stuff out of your head. It's not gonna do you any good. (somber music) (thunder rumbling) - This is very hard work. You have the easy job. This is a very special swing because it's a tickle swing. (giggling) I have a hard job. You, on the other hand... You're having all the fun, Jonah. I am doing all the work on the tickle swing. (radio chatter) (tires screeching) Okay. There we go. There we go on the tickle swing. (giggling) (thunder rumbling) - How is Demetrius? - Sarah's scared he's gonna do something else to Bailey. She won't leave him alone with her for a minute. It's messed up, Dennis. - [Dennis] Gee, I don't know what to tell you. - I mean, it's messed up and I don't know how to reach him. - That's a tough one. - Yeah. How are you doing? - Yeah, you know, I'm doing great. I got a folding chair and a stepladder and I got a new blender over there. (laughing) - [Ben] Shit, man. - What the... Let me get that. - You're a gimp. What, did you fuck up your knee? You all right with this, old man? (shouting) Can you go up and help Sir Elton in the boudoir? - [Jordan] Oh yeah, that's real funny there, Crockett. (drill whirring) - I gotta talk to him. - Can I get my beer? I got it. Come on. (thunder rumbling) - What's up, Harry? - I was reading the police report about Demetrius's critical missing. And it said that you hit him. - Well, it was a reaction. I didn't even think about it. - You should have, man. - What do you mean? - It said that you struck him. That you hit him on the face. - Okay, so? - So they have to investigate for child abuse. It's automatic. - What the fuck are you talking, what? - [Jimmy] Hey hey hey hey, whatever he did, Ben, please don't throw the first punch. He's the only Jewish cop in the city. He bruises easy, please. - Harry. - You're gonna talk to everyone you know about the history of violence. So you better call up Angela's boyfriend and you apologize to him. Do you hear me? - [Ben] Are you serious? - You wanna keep joint custody of Demetrius, you do it. - [Jimmy] Jesus. - Oh, he already threw the first punch.

No no, I have to go, I can't do this. - What are you talking about? You're the one that wanted to move in. I didn't force you. - You never wanted me here. You never did. I had to beg you. I had to beg you. - You wanna go, there's the door, okay? But know this, I'm not gonna be chasing you. I'm not gonna chase anybody ever again, okay? - You just give up just like that. You just give up. That's it, huh? - I'm not giving up. You're the one that wants to leave. Come here, look. - I love the kids. I love you. Why don't you see that? Why don't you see that, what's wrong with you? Get away from me, get away, get away, get away. - [Jimmy] Jesus. - Stupid, I don't belong here. I don't want to do this. (sobbing) I'm done. I'm done. (somber piano music) - What happened? - I don't know. Dina left. - Is she coming back? - I don't know. Go to bed, I gotta go downstairs. - Dad. Don't start smoking again, okay? (sighing) (knocking) (knocking) (banging) - [Wife] It's 4:30 in the morning, Dennis, what do you want? Oh, Jesus. - I didn't know you smoked. - There's a lot of things you don't know, Jimmy. I'm so cold. (sighing) - Are things settling down? - Hard to say. D's staying at his mom's until things are cleared up. You know, I hate to say it, but it's been better for Bailey. And for me. 'Cause things are calmer around the house, you know? - How's Ben taking it? - Not good. He's really nervous about that interview next week. - Hey, Sarah, don't worry about that, okay? He's gonna do fine. And listen to me. If you ever need to talk to someone about anything, it doesn't matter what it is, please call me. I'm rooting for you guys, you know that, huh? - I do. And I appreciate it. We both do. - Are you telling us that you called your ex-babysitter? You sick fuck. - [Jimmy] Your time's gonna come. - What were you thinking? - I don't know. - Been there, didn't do that. - Well after a few weeks, I got it. - Got what? - That I was a sick fuck. - You got company. (chuckling) - Well, how are you gonna handle it? - Therapy, I guess. - [Jordan] What? - I told Sheila I wanted to go to a marriage counselor. - Oh, Dennis, you're going back? - Well, going forward is like going to a train wreck. If you go back, at least you know what to expect. - Oh fuck that shit, man. Fuck that. That bitch, she lied to you. She trapped you. And now you're gonna go back to her and be a victim again? - Harry, goddamn, tell us how you really feel. - Come on, Harry, you're not talking about Sheila, you're talking about Mary. - [Ben] Oh. - Shut the fuck up, Jimmy. Why don't you mind your business, man? - Truth hurts. - [Ben] Ow. - Hey, all I know is, outside of you guys, I don't have a life anymore. - No, you just don't have that life anymore. - A-fucking-men. - Amen. ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ - It's so great that you guys had us over. - Oh, it's our pleasure. Would you like some more wine? - No thank you, no, just coffee. - That's glass number six or seven for you, isn't it? - And your point? - It's all right. She is not driving this evening. Staying here. - Hey. Well, Amelia should be about ready for Sunday school, is she not? She's almost five by my count. - Uncle John, she is five. - Then let's get to it. Holy communion. - We're on it, Dad, okay, we are. - We? (chuckling) What? - Uh (chuckling) I think that I have successfully talked Victoria into moving in with Amelia and I. Yeah. - Jesus, Mary, and-- - And Joseph. - Does this mean that-- - What it means is that I am just gonna be helping Jordan out with Amelia for awhile. - Will you still be working at the Merchandise Mart, Victoria? - I think that, Uncle John, that she's-- - I'm still here, thank you. I'm gonna be working from home. I'm gonna move my studio into the family room. - Amelia will be so happy about that. - It's God's work, Victoria. - Uncle John, the living arrangements may have changed, but the sexual preferences, now they are definitely staying the same. - [Father] Not at the table. - Dessert, anyone? (chattering) - [Ben] Mallory. Listen, I got a quick one for you. - Thought those days were gone. - A question. - Watch your mouth. Dogs die hard. - Hey, listen, come on. I don't make a habit of this, but this is important to me. - Okay, Ben, what? - Last week, a brother comes in here to see me. All right, and you wait on us. Name's Dave. - Lots of guys hit on me. - No no no, did you do him? - That's none of your damn business. - Mallory, it is my business. - Ben, you and I are long done. - No, Mallory, listen, wait. - You've got no right to come in here and ask me that. - Mallory, it's not about us. Now he's with my ex. (sighing) - Jesus Christ. - You know, all that, all that, I just need to know. Mm. - [Mallory] Sorry. - No no no, it's cool. - [Dennis] What was the question? - Do you also want to save this marriage, Dennis? - Well, yes. That's why we're both here, right? - That's why I'm here. - And we've both established that. That's great. - Dennis always does everything he's asked. He's always agreeable. Aren't you? You're always so damn agreeable. Aren't you, Dennis? - Is that true, Dennis? - Yes. (chuckling) - [Shelia] See what I mean? (phone ringing) - Listen, okay, just let me say it again. We were at the store. I had my son. He's my son. And we were coming out of the grocery store, and you know, there's traffic and everything, and I kept telling him, "D, stay close to me." Stay close to me 'cause I can't watch him and push the basket 'cause I got my daughter right here. And he's a smart kid, he understands that. You know, but... I'm trying to put the groceries in the car. You know, and I'm leaning over and I'm checking every now and then, I'm leaning over, and all of a sudden I look around and the basket's like going down the aisle. And my immediate reaction was to go get the basket but it just... It was an accident. I don't hit my children. It's the first time it had happened. - You've never struck your son? - Of course not. - Hey, kid. - Hey, Maxie. - Get any Nazis lately? - No Nazis here, Max. - Your lips to God's ears. - You know, I was reading this article about tomatoes. They're doing this genetic modification stuff. You know, they're putting pig DNA in there. Does that make it tripe? - Trafe, schmuck. Have some fresh fruit. - No no no, I don't need it. I do need something, Max. - I knew it was a shakedown. The only cop in town and he's putting the muscle on me. - I just need some information. - What do you need, Kojak? - Have you been faithful during your marriage? That question's for both of you. - Yes, I have been faithful. I have. - What? - Say it, Dennis. - Would it make a difference if I did? - Would it make a difference, Dennis? - I suppose, yes. Yes, I have been faithful in the past and I'm faithful now. - And by now you mean during this trial separation? (scoffing) - Yes. - Is that true, Dennis? - Yes. - Is it? - How do you discipline your son, Mr. Stoler? - Well timeouts, you know, usually. You know, ordinary stuff. - Mm-hmm. And it works? - Yeah. Yeah, usually it does, it does. - And you've never raised your hand to him? - Look, I already told you. - Yes, and Demetrius's mother has said that she's seen you slap him. - Oh Jesus. Okay, maybe once. Maybe once. I spanked him, but who hasn't? - Many parents, Mr. Stoler. They've learned to use non-violent means to discipline their children. - This is ridiculous, I do not hit my children. - According to witnesses and your own words, you did indeed hit your child. And there's little to assure the court you won't again. - Look, I give you... I give you my word. - And suppose your son harms your daughter again? How do you expect to discipline him? (phone ringing) I'm afraid your word is not enough assurance. (phone ringing) - Just a little help. I just need a little help with it. - So, Harry the non-Jew Jew wants to know about the faith he doesn't believe in so he can answer his son's questions about the faith he doesn't want him to grow up in. - I just don't wanna have to keep telling him to go ask his mother, you know? Or my father. Every goddamn time. - Hey, watch your language. You want his help, don't be damning his name. - There's no him, Max. It's your help that I need. - We're together me and him, partners. - Whatever, whatever. Are you gonna help me? - No. - What do you mean you're not gonna help me? - I'm gonna help Jonah, because your son deserves to know who he is and what his traditions are. Even if his meshugganah father doesn't. - Thank you. I owe you one. - Go, go. Shoot some Nazis. - [Harry] There's no Nazis here, Max. (electric guitar music) - [Angela] You're not supposed to see him until the court date. - I know, it's not about that. - Then what is it about? - Don't leave him alone with Dave. - What are you talking about? He loves Dave. And so do I. - No, Angela, you have to trust me on this. - Oh, I'mma trust you? Mm-hmm. Please. Not every man is you. - No, listen, Angela, wait a minute. Listen to me. - No, I'm not gonna listen to you, okay? You have your white woman and your half-white child, mm-hmm. But your black son and me have a black man who loves us. So leave us alone. (bell ringing) - What do you mean kids? - I have all these kids inside me and they all want to come out and play, Jimmy, 'cause they like you and they want you to like them. - Yeah, but how do you know which one like which one's the one that's gonna come out or? - Well, it's Laura who you have to watch out for. She's only 12. But she would take the brunt of my dad. She was the sexy one. So she would protect the rest of us. - How do you deal with sex, Dina? I mean, I would've never known. I mean, you seem to be open to anything. - Look, you're the first normal guy I've been with. You know I love it. - You gotta be kidding me. - Remember my second husband Walt? Well, he would... He would tie me up in a chair in my bra and panties and lock me in the closet just to get turned on. And even then, he would only fuck me in the ass. - Jesus. But why would you go through all that, Dina, through all that shit? - 'Cause that's all I knew, don't you get it? All those years with my father doing all those things to me. That was normal for me. But it wasn't me that Walt was fucking. It was Laura. Jimmy, you're the first guy who just looks at me and gets turned on. I don't have to do any gyrations to have sex. You actually kiss me. (knocking) - Dad, I can't sleep. Will you lay with me? - Joey, you're eight years old. Come on, grow up. Get back to sleep, let's go. Come on. - No no no, I know everything about not sleeping. I'll lay with him. - No I got it, I got it. It's all right, Dina. Five minutes, all right? And that's it. No more. I'll be back. Hey. I'll be back. (somber piano music) - Daddy. Daddy. - What? Is everything all right? - Go ahead, ask your father. - [Amelia] No. - Ask me what? - You have to ask him first. - No. - What's going on? (sighing) - Ask your daughter. - You all right? What is it, sweetie? - Lay down. - [Jordan] Wow. (sighing) (romantic music) - How's Jonah? - He's fine. He asked me about Shabbat last night. - Oh yeah? And you say? - Well I said what Max told me to say. - Which was? - That when God made the world, he left us one day to admire his work. And that that was Shabbat. And that it was the sweetest day of the week. - Very good. - [Harry] Yeah, I have trouble with that one. Oh, you're very good. What are you doing that for? What are you doing? Get out of my pockets. - [Shelly] You keep every napkin you get? (giggling) - Give it here. Don't don't don't don't don't. I'll never remember your number. - Yes, you will. - And then Jonah was asking whether it was Friday or Saturday night and I told him it was Friday and Saturday. - Sunday until sunset. - [Harry] Right. (giggling) - Did you tell him about the hallah? - What are you talking about? - [Shelly] The hallah. - What's that? - It's made from your choice of flour. It tastes sweet. Like cake. You eat it all week long. (laughing) - What was that? - What? One of the advantages of being separated is you get to eat out more often. (laughing) - You lied. - About what? - About being faithful. - During marriage, Dennis. The doctor didn't ask me about being faithful since you left me, huh? If she had, I would've told her the truth. - And the truth is? - The truth is you just found out. - Did you date another guy? Did you? Right here in this bed? I hope you changed the sheets. - Well, you left me. You fucker. Oh Jesus. Dennis. Dennis. (sobbing) - Your brother ready? - Yeah. Dina's just combing his hair. It's about time somebody did. - [Jimmy] Did you eat? - I'm not hungry. - Eat. - No. I like Dina. She's smart. Don't blow it, okay? - What? - Don't let her see your sexist pictures with your sicko models running around in their underwear. She'll tear 'em up. - She knows what I do. - Doesn't mean she likes it. And stop smoking, it's disgusting. - I love you. - [Grace] I love you too. - Come on, now. Come on, now. I got you. (panting) Had enough? - [Ben] Yeah, old man. (chuckling) Yeah, I had enough. (heavy exhale) (footfalls) - Dad, you in the closet? - Jesus, Paula, I thought you were your mother. - You know, you kinda blew your cover parking your car in the driveway. (laughing) You should try around the block next time. - Yeah. Yeah. - How you doing? - I thought you were at school. - Early Christmas break. (sighing) So. - Are you all right? - Yeah, you? - I'm fine. (laughing) - Is that why you're hiding in the closet? - Yeah. You know, it's like (sighing) being at a completely different house. - I know, the pillows. (laughing) And the parasol. - God. (chuckling) - I never even saw you guys fight. - I know. Maybe that was the problem, we didn't fight. How's your sister taking all of this? - She thinks everything's gonna be okay when she comes home for Christmas. (sobbing) Will it? - I don't know. I don't know. - You ain't lost your touch, boy. - No, just my son. - They tell you that? - It's coming. You and Mom okay? - Huh-uh. - You fucking around again? - Hell no. - You picking up Demetrius this weekend? - Yeah. But I ain't bringing him to the house. It's not a good idea. - Old man, it's okay. I won't come by. I just want him to be with you and Mom, you know? - No, you don't. I'm leaving your mother this time. For good. - Old man, y'all both crazy. - I never been crazy. Stupid, selfish, yeah. Never crazy. - But why now after all these years? You know what, no, that's all right, don't tell me. My life's so fucked up right now I don't even, I can't take it. Man, you just... - She hates your girl and the baby. She thinks you kiss up to all your white friends and turn your back on your own kind. - Mom? - Let me finish or I'll never get it all out. She's the one pouring hate into D. Telling him you love that white girl more than him. And sooner or later, you're gonna leave him, 'cause he coal black and ain't white enough. I told her she poisoned the shit out of that kid. And it ain't right to turn D against you. And that's the damn truth. And that's why I can't be with that woman no more. - [Player] A little help? (grunting and moaning) (knocking) - Jeez, I thought you were Amelia. - Yeah, that's the point. I thought we set the rules. None of your fun fucks in the house while Amelia is here. - Hey, Carter is not a fun fuck and Amelia is always here. And so am I, we live here. - You just need to find a new place for sex, okay? I don't want her exposed to any of your boyfriends unless they're serious. - Well, is six months serious enough for you? - You never said anything about having a boyfriend-- - Are you my fucking father? Anyway, he's always gone before Amelia wakes up in the morning. - You've done this before? - Yes. And I'm probably gonna do it again. You jealous, Mr. Mom? Go to sleep. (techno music) - Slap my ass. - What? - Slap my ass. Again. Harder. Yeah. Harry. - [Harry] How does that feel? - [Shelly] Oh yeah. Harder. - [Harry] How's that? - [Shelly] Oh yeah. (somber electric guitar music) - I can't live without him, Sarah. I just can't. He's my life. - We're your life. Me, Bailey. It's not just D. - You don't understand. - No, you don't understand, Ben. Be careful you don't lose us too. (somber piano music) (moaning) - Fuck my ass. - I want Dina back. - Okay. - Turned you on, didn't it? - I hurt you. - That's the point, Harry. - I never smacked tits before. Ass, but not tits. - Bet you can't wait to see what's next. - Look, I don't want to lead you on but... - Harry, I'm not looking for a relationship. Just some occasional fucking discipline. - Good, 'cause being a cop... - It's the best part of you. You come with the equipment I like. - Yeah, and with Jonah-- - He is precious. That boy of yours. He calls you Harry. - Yeah, I don't have a lot of time. - I understand. You're a good father. - Right. And... - You'll make time for me. It's inevitable. (moaning) - What can't you talk about to the rest of the guys? - Look, you gotta understand that you can't tell anybody, okay? It's between me and you, you understand? - Why me? Before a game? - During or after, if I could. You know that thing that you and Steve went through? You know, when you guys split? - That thing? - The meetings. You remember? The sex compulsion or something? - Yeah, no, you mean Steve's sex addiction, yes. All the therapy and the Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings. It was a nightmare. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Are you a sex addict? - No. Hell, we all are. It's just, you know, Dina. - She's a sex addict? - It's complicated. No, I mean, I guess, you know, not by choice. - I have no idea where you're going with this. - She's an incest survivor, you know? Her dad. - Well, do the kids know? - What, mine or hers? - She got kids? - Yeah, 18 at last count. - Oh. Oh. Multiple personalities. - Yeah. - Jesus. (speaking in foreign language) - Look, just translate it. - Savage. Okay. Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has hallowed us with thy commandments, and now commands us to kindle the light of the Holy Shabbat. Uncover your eyes and behold the Shabbat lights. - Did you write it down? - Yeah, on tablets, like God to Moses. It's in the box with the candles. Go, go, give it to Jonah before sunset. And this time, do it at your house, not your father's. And find a good Jewish woman. Oi. - [Amelia] Feel the imagination. - I know. I can't believe it didn't take her very long. - [Victoria] Carter has a way with women. - I'm sure. He's handsome. - Hey, keep off. - What? I was complimenting his taste, and yours. - Yeah. He is tasty. - That's disgusting. You're disgusting. I can't believe you. What if he hears you? - Anyways, he says that I'm the best he's ever had. Apparently. It's true. We should compare notes, you and me. - No, I think that you would definitely win that one hands down. (laughing) - Hands down, I get it, hands down. - That's not the way I meant it. See, get your head out of the toilet. No, come on, I'm gonna finish the dishes. - No no no, I want you to play with us, come on. Come on, come come come come. (jovial music) (shouting) (laughing) (applause) Oh, bravo. ♪ Jesus was born on Christmas morn ♪ - [Victoria] I adore you. - I could use a little refreshment. - Oh well, I believe I can manage that. I'll be right back. - Me too. Me too. - [Victoria] Okay, come on, darling. - Woo. That was hysterical. I didn't intend to do that. - In public? - [Carter] Yeah. (laughing) (sighing) - [Jordan] So. Getting along well? - Just great. - Yeah. - Listen, I knew your ex. He was a real power bottom. (sighing) - Why were you at my house? - Jesus, Shelia, you scared the shit out of me. - Answer me. - I don't know. - What were you doing? Looking for condoms under the bed, huh? New underwear in the drawer, stains on the sheet? - Stop, will you? I'm... I'm stupid, I'm sorry, okay? - Yeah. - [Dennis] You going somewhere? - Yeah, after 25 years I think it's about time, don't you? What'd you tell Paula? - Well, you told her to ask me what happened, so I did. Thanks. - You're better at lies than I am. - I wasn't always. Listen, are you seeing some other guy or what? - Well, that's none of your business. - Come on, we're in counseling. - I'm thinking about stopping. - Oh, don't. - Why? What, you getting lonely now? You getting tired of your sleeping bag and your blender? Maybe you just haven't found somebody to sweat over you, huh? Stop that. God. You toss me out of your life. You fucking leave me. You leave me. The best part of my life, and you're gone. You... I slept with you, I gave you children. Jesus Christ. - Come on, come on. - [Sheila] I put your whole life in order and you left me. - You love me. - Stop it. Stop it. (sobbing) - You love me. - Yes, I always loved you. - Come on. Let's fuck. Come on, let's fuck. (sobbing) - You fuck me. That's what you do to me. I always made love to you. Shit, there never was much light in this place. - I'm sorry. (scoffing) - Yeah. Tell it to your kids. - Fuck! (glass shattering) (grunting) Get off me. Jesus Christ, get off. Give me it, give me it. Come on. (somber music) - [Jimmy] Dennis, okay, breathe. - What is it, man? - Hit your knee? - You having a heart attack, what is it, Dennis? - I don't think so. (sobbing) It's okay, Dennis. It's over, isn't it? It's okay, Dennis. It's okay, man. (knocking) - What? - Oh, I have something for Jonah. - I give Jonah everything he needs. - Can you just get him, please? - You get him. - I'm not going in there. They're Shabbat candles, okay? Will you get him now? - Hypocrite. - I guess it's better than savages. They're from Max, all right, not me. He thought Jonah should have 'em. - I have Shabbat candles. - They're not for you, they're for him. All right, I don't give a shit about this mumbo jumbo. Just get my damn kid. - Your life teaches you as a policeman not to trust God. But your son, he can believe. Is that so bad? And my bate, he has a right to discover for himself that God is trustworthy. Or not. - You are like a broken record. It's the same thing over and over again. Just, look, I have to go. I am on duty. If you don't want to give him the candles, then don't. (somber music) (tires screeching) - [Grandfather] Okay now, bring it to me. (clapping) - Woo, all right. Oh. Woo. (clapping) - Hey, D, listen, listen. We gotta talk this out, boy, me and you. Come on, you, listen, I'm not gonna hit you. I swear to God. - Get away from me. - Come on, just you and me, man. - Ma, Ma. - Come on. You gotta know the truth, come on. - You son of a bitch. What the hell are you doing? - [Demetrius] Mom. - [Angela] D, give me back my son. - Mom. - Hurry up. - [Demetrius] Mom. - D. D. D. (tires screeching) D. Oh my god, my son. You planned this. - I didn't, Angela. - Oh my god. Yes, you did. He's your fucking son. Your fucking son. (banging) - [Shelly] Who is it? Hello, who is it? - I don't have a lot of time. - Wow. You're a walking sex shop, Captain America. - Here. - What is it? - Fucking candles. - How romantic. - [Ben] You understand me? I'm never gonna leave you. - [Demetrius] I don't care. (phone ringing) Where are you going? - I don't know. - [Harry] Come here, come here. - [Shelly] Ow. - [Harry] That's right, get down. Open. (radio chatter) You don't like it? - Ow. - [Harry] This is what you wanted, right? - You're good at this, Harry. Maybe too good. - I'm sorry, D, I didn't mean to. It's just that I love you. - I'm scared. I want Mom. I want my mom. - I know it. - I want my mom. - I know, I know, D. I know. Christ. - It's time for bed. - When am I gonna have a baby sister? - What? - Grandpa says I should have one. And a baby brother and another. That's what families do. - Ah. Grandpa said that, huh? We'll talk about that in the morning, all right? You have sweet dreams, okay? I love you. - I love you too, Daddy. Goodnight, Mama. - [Victoria] Goodnight, darling. Love you. (phone ringing) (radio chatter) - [Harry] Don't you fucking move away from me. - [Shelly] Harry. - [Harry] Hold still. Hold still. That's my girl. That's my girl. - Answer it. It could be your son. - Dennis. Yeah, it's Ben. He took D, they're on the 1st Street Bridge. No, it's too late, man, it's too late. Angela already called it in. Yeah, yeah. No, they got him on like parental abduction. We gotta get there first. Call the guys. I'll meet you on the east side of the bridge and we'll go in together. - That was a Catholic moment. (phone ringing) - To be honest, I actually thought about it. - Well, you can stop thinking about it. 'Cause in case you hadn't noticed, you're gay. And I'm not. Jordan, I'm with Carter. And I'm assuming that he's probably gonna wanna have some kids of his own, maybe. And I will happily carry his sperm, be his wife, his lover, his fun fuck, whatever you wanna call it. But just so you know, we probably won't be living here. - I take it then that you don't wanna have anymore children with me. - Fuck you, Jordan. Do you honestly expect me to leave two children behind? Because I don't even know. I don't know how I am gonna say goodbye to her when I have to. How dare you. And you can tell your fucking family to stop planting little seeds because you're not planting any more in me. (phone ringing) - He just took him. - Oh my god. - [Dennis] Meet me at Bull Run. - Okay, all right. I'll be there. - What's the matter, Jimmy? - I gotta go right now. - What is it? - It's Ben, his kid. - Go. - [Joey] Be-doh. - I'll be here with Joey. - [Joey] Come on. - Go. I live here now. - [Joey] Dina. (tense music) - [Ben] No, stay there. I'm gonna lock the door. - [Harry] Let him go. - [Ben] And if I don't, what, Harry? What are you gonna do? - Don't go there. Don't even go there. Open that door and hand your son to me. - I can't do it, Harry. I can't do it, Harry. Harry, man, look, it's fucked up but I can't. - Ben, we know what you're going through. - No, Jimmy, I don't fucking think so. - [Harry] I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna go do if you don't give me your son right now. - Get away from my car. No, no. - Hey, hey. Hey. Ben, just no violence, no violence in front of the boy, all right? Don't. - He's not your boy. He's not your boy. - I know your son. - Jordan, he's my son. And I'm not letting anybody fucking take him from me. - Ben, nobody's gonna take anybody from you. - Don't patronize me, Dennis. - I am not patronizing you, Jesus. Remember that day in the shower when I told you that I was losing it and I didn't know anything anymore and you said, "Well, that's okay, "because we've all been through it. "None of us know shit anyhow." Well, you were right, man. I mean, maybe I'd be doing the same thing you're doing. I don't know, maybe we all would. And maybe you'd be doing what we're doing right now, trying to stop you from ruining your life and ruining his life too. Ben, he's never gonna forget this. Never. Come on, do the right thing. - She called it in. There's nothing I can do for you. So open up this car and give me your boy. - [Ben] I'm gonna lose him. - Ben, you do this and you run away with him, you're gonna lose him for sure. - You need help. Ben, he needs help. Hell, we all do. - I'm gonna lose him, Harry. - There's another way, there's another way. We're all here for you, man. - Ben. Please. - Come on, Ben. Just think about what you're doing. - Okay, okay. - [Ben] Dennis. (sobbing) (somber music) - [Harry] Ben, let me have him. Come on, D. - [Ben] Harry. - Just give him a chance, Harry. - They're coming. - Can you forgive me? - [Demetrius] Yes. Yes. - Go with him, go with him. - [Harry] It's gonna be okay, D. I'll take you to your mom. - Oh man. - Oh shit, Dennis. I'm sorry. - Good guy, good guy. (somber music) ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ (upbeat jazz music)
