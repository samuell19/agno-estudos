(crickets chirping) (ominous music) (typewriter clicking) - When are you gonna tell me what's inside? - Mary, I'll explain it to you when you're old enough to understand the eternal mystery of transubstantiation. - Please, Father. - It's the body of Christ. - The one we use at mass? - Yes, indeed. Now leave me be, I need to finish this homily before Sunday. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) You let God out! (dramatic music) (ominous music) - Please, Father. Can I come back in? It's freezing! - I'll let you sleep in the attic if you can recite for me Leviticus chapter three. - I, I can't. (ominous music) (Mary coughs) (dramatic music) (ominous music) - Mary, come on. Come on. Let's get up. Mary? Mary? (ominous music) (dramatic synth music) (bells chiming) - I just wanted to let you know how awful it was what happened to you today. - Oh, nevermind that. I'm really into this novel right now. You should go back to sleep. - What happened? - Just Father Munhauser, the bastard. He scolded me again for no good reason. - Still, neither of you have yet to be paddled by him. - I heard he's responsible for that poor student's death a few years ago. Did he beat her to death? I only ask because he's known for severe abuse, but he can only punish you if your parents give him permission, like yours did. - It was a failed exorcism. The girl, Mary, her name was, she started acting, you know, demonic, possessed. I mean, some say that she was just going through puberty, but he thought she was going mad. - Poor Mary. I wish there was some way we could get revenge. Kill that son of a bitch. - Stop, it's all just hearsay, speculation. Besides, I thought he was a good guy before today. - I know where it happened. It was in his cabin. He enslaved her there to do experiments on her. - We have to go. How far is it from here? - About a day's hike. - (laughs) Let's break out of here. How's this plot compared to the one you're reading? - I only read romance and you guys can go enjoy it by yourselves and have fun getting locked up. - No one's gonna be there. It's vacant this time of year. - Well, I guess I'd rather be in prison than here. (both laughing) (ominous music) (mysterious synth music) - [Jodi] Isn't it just charming? You know, I could spend the rest of my life in a little place like this. (Lori laughs) - [Lori] No way! Why would anyone with your ambition wanna spend their whole life in a place out in the country like this? (door rattling) (door creaks) - Nope, nope, can't do it. It reeks of religion in there. - Hey, maybe we'll find his wine and tune into Dallas playing the Super Bowl! Oh. - Girls, I found letters. We have to read them. (birds chirping) - He tried for weeks, every night until she cried blood and ate nothing. (lightning crashes) (thunder rumbling) (chains rattling) - Deliver her, be gone evil, be gone. I cast you out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Be gone, be gone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You are crushed under his foot. You are crushed under his heel. (lightning crashes) (dramatic synth music) (Priest muttering) - [Jodi] Some say this is where it took a darker turn for the worst. Everyone knows what he did to her, but it wasn't for selfish reasons. It was his final method to draw the evil out. (Father Munhauser speaking Latin) - [Lori] He hoped it would flee from her body and inhabit his instead. But being a priest, he didn't know the first thing about women except how to punish them when they misbehaved. (Father Munhauser speaking Latin) (lightning crashes) (Father Munhauser speaking Latin) (ominous synth music) - [Lori] It's unclear what happened next. Some believe he impregnated her and killed her to save his reputation at the Reform Academy. - [Peg] Let's just bury the bird real quick. (birds chirping) (door rattling) - Hey, who the hell is that? - Just looking for a shovel. - Y'all trespassing. - Uh-uh, this here's forest land. We know our rights! - That may be true. You can mess around the grounds here, but that there cabin is somebody's private getaway. - Hey, you all Manhauer's nieces or something? - Yeah, that's right. - Wait, I know you. Aren't you the janitor from St. Catherine's? - That's right, I'm Nestor. I take care of the grounds. pull weeds and such. - You helped me untie the knot on my shoe once. Peeked up my skirt too. - I get in eyefuls when I can. Like right now. And a word of warning, keep away from the stinging nettles and don't dig in the ground for nothing. This here is sacred Indian burial ground. - (laughs) Those are my people, we're fine. (Nestor chuckles) (door slams shut) - Snazzy place. I wasn't expecting it to be this nice, right? - Hey, at least he's got some good records because I was jonesing for a groove. (funky disco music) - Oh, something weird's happened at the neighbors. - So what are we doing about dinner? - I don't know. There's some mutant animal parts in the freezer. Maybe you can make a soup. - You're sick. How about some split pea soup? - That will keep us warm tonight. - You know what else would keep us warm? A fire! I'll get the kindling. (bird chirping) (ominous synth music) (bird chirping) (mysterious music) (bird chirping) (dramatic music) (Jodi groaning) (birds chirping) (funky disco music) - Here, snap a real good one of me. - Sure! (camera shutter clicks) - Jeez, Lori, you're built like a brick house. - (laughs) Thank you. (funky disco music) (ominous synth music) (Jodi laughing) (dramatic music) (Jodi screams) (suspenseful music) - That's my swing. - So very sorry. (laughs nervously) I'm Jodi. What's your name? - I don't remember. - Oh. (laughs nervously) So you live around here or? (dramatic music) - I died here and death is near you and all you filthy whores. (Jodi screaming) (dramatic synth music) (Jodi sobbing) - Jodi, what happened? - It was horrible. There was a girl there! (sobs) It was a demon, it was a demon! - Come on now. You're just trying to get us in the mood for some ghost stories. - No, no, it really happened! - Maybe it was an apparition? - Uh-uh. Sounds like someone found the shine and it had a good sip. (Jodi sobbing) - Maybe we should just play a game or something? - This isn't time for charades! We need to tear this place up for clues. - There's no way we could read through all the letters. (Jodi sobbing) (ominous synth music) - Who do you think they are? - Victims. (dramatic music) (Jodi shouts) (teeth chattering) - Lori, that's not funny! Who are you calling? - My boyfriend, Braddock. - Boyfriend? That's a laugh. - You've just never met him. He's a dream. Wish he was here right now. - We've already been in enough trouble. We don't need men. I mean, we're already playing hooky anyway. - Ugh, you're right. We're basically fugitives already. We might as well just leave. Go back, face the music. - Nestor's already seen us. We should just ride this train out 'til the end of the line. I mean, we gotta find some closure. Besides, it's all just rumors right now anyway. - Not if it's written down. I think I just found his journal. "I've been trying to recall the days. "The nights feel eternal. "As I fail to know the improvements "I've made in the poor girl, "the convulsions only worsen a withering soul. "Only more sickened by the surroundings "and the perhaps ill will of her strange mother." - This may take some getting used to, Mary, but we wanna shield you from the evil and the sin of this wicked world. - [Father Munhauser] I have doubts in my mind about her parenting. Forcing snake oil, alternative medicines on her, who has claimed she found her recipes in dreams where witch doctors appeared to her Native savages nonetheless, I'm now convinced her secret family potion made of moss and elderberry could only hasten the subject's disposition. (chains rattling) (lightning crashes) - We need to speak about Mary, dear. - My own concerns matter little because I'm really a humble servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. But Mary, she's troubling me. Always walking around town like a common tart. I wonder where she learned that from? - (gasps) Are you referring to me? - And always making a mockery during the mass, yawning incessantly when I give the homily and when I lift up the Holy Eucharist, incessant giggles. It's, it's a mockery. And her knees always exposed like a temptress. - If you weren't so cheap, she wouldn't have such an ill-fitting uniform. - All right, enough. In first Timothy, he talks about how women shouldn't be permitted to speak in to church. He should have extended that to the household. - Well, we need to make a decision tonight. - Okay, I've decided. Mary no longer goes to school. You could teach her at home. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (girl giggling) (dramatic music) (shovel clangs) (suspenseful music) - Tithes and offerings? Holy mackerel! - No. I didn't know the old man was loaded. There must be at least $500 there. - [Jodi] Try twice that. - You know, if we had a bookie, we could put it all on the Cowboys to win. - Gambling's a sin. Also, (laughs) we already have enough bad luck as it is. - We could change our names. Ooh, hide out in L.A. - Now you're talking. (laughs) We could get our nails done and go shopping like sophisticated ladies. - Oh, this is perfect. Now I'll be all ready for that new magazine I was telling you about. - Hustlers? - Yep, they're gonna love me. - Yeah, and all the mules who read it. - I just have to submit some more fees. (Jodi snickers) - This isn't you. - It's me. (ominous music) What? - It's Mary. Look. - Ugh, I don't, I don't like this one bit. - No, no, no, no, no. This is a good thing. I mean, she wasn't in any of the photos with the victims. So this means she's here with us. She wants us to be here. (crickets chirping) (ominous synth music) (shovel clangs) It definitely isn't animal, maybe pelvic bone? - It's her remains, isn't it? - No, remember Nestor's warning? It has to be a native's. - Well, if we didn't awaken a spirit before, we definitely have now. (gunshot blasts) (all gasp) What was that? - It sounded like a gunshot. - [Peg] Should we go check it out? - I think it's Lori's turn to go. - (sighs) Fine, we'll all go. (crickets chirping) - Someone's over there. - Show yourself! - Oh god, this guy again. (dramatic music) - Evening, ma'ams. - Nestor, you scared us. - What the hell are you doing holding a gun? - Yeah, evil spirits can't die from that. - Yeah, but the critters can. I'm hankering for a gumbo. (animal growling) - Something's there! - That's the one that casts no shadow. (animal growling) - It just looks like a normal cat. - I think that's a bobcat. - I'm gonna get me a $10 pelt. That'll be 22 this year. (animal growling) - No! Stop! (animal growling) It's just a sweet little pussy. - Oh my gosh, how cute! - Yeah, that's not a bobcat. - She wouldn't hurt anyone. (owl hoots) Want some milk? - Oh, so sweet. So demonic. - (sighs) Well, I'm bushed. I think I'm gonna go lay down. - Bye, baby! (cat meows) (crickets chirping) - Maybe we should go talk to Nestor. - [Lori] No, he's crazy! - Yeah, but he might know something about this place. - [Lori] Pssh, I do not wanna get shot. - If we get shot, we get shot together. - [Lori] Uh, okay. (crickets chirping) (Jodi knocks on door) - [Nestor] Who's that? - It's us, the pretty girls you've been spying on. - Oh, hello there. - Hi. - Oh, hold on, let me get decent. (crickets chirping) Okay. - So anyway, why do you live in the shed like some creep when you could be living in that cabin? It's right there. - Well, this here's the groundskeepers quarters and I'm the faithful groundskeeper and I prefer staying out here and I ain't never going inside that cabin again. - So you know about Mary? - Shh! Don't ever say her name, foolish girls. The more you blabber, the more she'll haunt your souls. (door slams shut) (ominous music) - Well, that was weird. - Maybe we should listen to his warning. (owl hooting) - Ugh, you're not sleepy, are you? Yep, that Peg is such a party pooper. - I couldn't sleep a wink here. We still have a million questions that need to be answered. - That's why I brought this. Oh, mystical magic eight ball. Did Father Munhauser really torture her? My sources say no. (scoffs) Okay. Did he cause her death? Better not tell you now. - That stupid toy's not gonna give us the answers we need. We need to find something of hers that we can speak to her through. - Yet there's nothing here but ineligible scribblings on false teachings and pseudosciences. (sighs) We haven't searched the attic yet. You take a look while I finish combing through his journal some more. - Fine. (ominous music) (mysterious synth music) Ow! (Jodi groans) (dramatic music) (Jodi shouts) It's okay, it's okay. We're here to help you and reveal the truth and all that. - Please won't you bring me a glass of milk? - Yeah, yeah, I can do that. - And it better not be buttermilk! You were sent here for me to kill! (ominous music) (mysterious synth music) (ruler clacks) (Mary whimpers) - You can sleep inside tonight. But remember, your father promised to cut your tongue out if you spoke at the dinner table again. (ruler clacks) (ominous music) - What's wrong? - My dad cooked all the eggs for breakfast and made me eat them. (ominous synth music) - Did you see my favorite marble? It's a yellow one. - I'm sorry I haven't. - Eat my mushy! (laughs) Eat my mushy! (laughs) Eat my mushy! (laughs) Eat my mushy! (laughs) (ominous music) (chains rattling) - Repent to the Lord, I draw you out. - No, no! - Say the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ who died and on the third day rose from the dead and who according to the scriptures is the right hand of God. Say his name, the Lord Jesus Christ! (Peg screaming) in the name of the Mother Mary, mother of God. Say her name! (Peg screaming) The Lord God Yahweh, sayeth thee! Yahweh! - [Peg] Yahweh! (sobs) - I anoint thee in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Be gone, evil spirit! Be gone, foul spirit! Be gone! Be gone! - [Peg] No! (Peg sobbing) Why? (chains rattling) - [Mary] I'm sorry, Mother. - [Mother] You know the order. First bath for father, second bath for me. And the last bath for you, Mary. (Father Munhauser speaking in Latin) - [Mary] No, don't make me eat anymore. - [Mother] More moths, Mary. - [Father Munhauser] How dare you bring toys to the dining room table? - [Mary] Baby was hungry too, Papa. Why do you have to destroy my doll? - [Mother] Wasn't the bed of leaves that you raked this morning a cozy enough bed for you? (bell chiming) (ominous synth music) - And what God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. Nestor, you may kiss your bride. (ominous synth music) - [Peg] No! (crickets chirping) (both chanting) - Okay, we sound terrible. Let's try something else. Oh, spirit of thy young and innocent lamb. Let it be known that we shan't hurt you. - Yes, we are here to set you free. - Huh? It's working. Lori, I can sense her sadness. (dramatic music) - Peggy, what the heck? - It was horrifying! It was like a nightmare but real! I swear it really happened! - Sounds like we have a sleepwalker in denial. - Jodi, you know me best. Have I ever slept walked my life? - Well, a lot of weird stuff has been going on here, so I believe you. - Maybe you dosed us with some good LSD. Yep, for all I know you're the one going around pulling pranks on us while she's been asleep. - Come on, just sit down. (ominous music) - Oh my gosh. Jodi, your wrist. - It's nothing! - We gotta get something to put on that. (Jodi sighs) I'll be right back. - Oh, come on. (ominous synth music) (hamster chittering) - Aw, hey little fella. Aw, you're so cute. (hamster chittering) (ominous synth music) (Jodi and Lori chanting) - Girls. Girls, I found this. - Her stuff. - What more could we ask for? - This must be her diary. - Maybe you should put on the nightgown. - This old thing? - I double dog dare ya. - Ew, gross! I am not wearing this. It smells like... - Death. (light instrumental music) - Mary, this was your grandmother's rosary and now that you're 16 years old, I think she'd want you to have it. - Oh my God! She wants me to read this alone. (ominous music) - Mother Mary, I haven't much to say except I love them all. Even if they don't understand me. Am I ill? They insist I am but won't you tell me? It's normal for a girl to feel sad sometimes. It's hard to fathom the complexity of God's love. Help us. (somber piano music) (ominous music) - So what kind of herbal remedies are we concocting today? - A little clover blossom for the infusions. - Hg? I thought you used only natural ingredients. - Don't question my methods. (mysterious music) (crickets chirping) (Jodi sobbing) - What are you doing? Why did she do it, Peg? - Stop! - Why did she do it? (sobs) - You're gonna wreck it all! - They poisoned her, she wasn't possessed! She wasn't possessed, they poisoned her! - Who? Who are you talking about? - They poisoned her! (sobs) Why did she do it? (sobs) - Jodi! (slap thwacks) (dramatic music) (ominous synth music) (Jodi sobbing) (ominous music) (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (ominous choral music) (snake rattling) (snake hissing) (ominous synth music) (snake rattling) (snake hissing) (ominous synth music) (moth creature retching) (moth creature growling) - Ugh, you guys are the worst! - Eat up, you'll feel better. - No, I don't want any of your stupid soup. (Peg chuckles) - Either you drink the soup or put on the nightgown. - Ugh, fine! (sighs) (crickets chirping) - Heal the sick, raise the dead. Cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Voices not your own- - No, no, no, no. I don't wanna hear this. I know, sorry, I can't. (clears throat) - Wow, is there anything you can't make look good? - As long as you don't ask for another photo shoot. (both laughing) (piano music) (dramatic music) (Peg whimpers) (cat meowing) (ominous synth music) - Look, look, I just found this key! - Ooh, let me see. Hmm, I wonder. - Ugh, it obviously doesn't go there! - Try the wardrobe. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (all scream) - Can I take the nightgown off? Feeling kind of itchy and it's your turn to wear it. - [Father Munhauser] April 8th, 1969. I wish I had better news. Ruth's last batch had already seemed to sour in the sun. Nevertheless, she injected the cat with the potential remedy. (cat meows) I'm grateful Ruth's findings are complete and have been submitted to medical journals. But I fear the entire scientific community making sport of her research. She initially tried to create an antidote for early onset dementia but when my daughter became sullen and melancholy, Ruth fed the formula and her condition only worsened and we all had to bear the darkness, the delirium of unbearable deterioration and impending death. She concocted a tincture of niacin and rabies taken straight from one of the mangy coyotes my groundsman brought in. I now admit experimenting on the poor creature was cruel, for it truly altered her offspring for the worst. (crickets chirping) (ominous synth music) - Well, now we know we have access to the seventh gate of Hell. (dramatic music) - How can you girls be doing your makeup at a time like this? (car rumbling) There's someone in the driveway. - Hide! (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (car door slams) - Father, what you's doing here? I wasn't expecting you. - I need solitude, Nestor. - Wait, you's got something you needs to know before you ventures inside. - What is it? - Bad, bad infestation. - What kind of infestation? - You don't wants to know. - Step aside, Nestor. (Nestor grunts) Let me through. (insects buzzing) (insects buzzing) (ominous music) Who in the hell is in my house? I'm a priest. A prophet, a servant of the most high God. And you have defiled his house! (ceramic shatters) (dramatic music) (ominous music) Mary. - I've missed you, Father. - You're not my daughter. My daughter was pure and innocent and sweet! You're nothing like her. You're an illusion. You're a satanic illusion. - Just what I've always wanted, a surprise birthday party. Can my friends stay for dinner? - What friends? (door creaks) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (Father Munhauser shouts) (demon hissing) - Fake priest! - What kind of hell has been unleashed in this house? - Unholy father! - Be gone, false spirit! Henceforth and forever you and all your demons! - Don't embarrass God. - All allegiance begone with your father, the Devil! The father of lies! - You belong in hell with me! - Fallen angel be gone with you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. - All your life's work has been in vain! - You have no power over me! - Even angels mock your name. - Be gone, foul spirit! Be gone unclean spirit and all your legions, all your devils and join your father the devil Satan! - You're pathetic. - I'm filled with God in my life. - Soon you'll be sucking my horns in Hell! - You are not welcome in this house, you and all unclean spirits, go back to your bowels of wretchedness! - Never! - Go back to your holy Hell! Go back to your bowels of excrement! - Why is your dick getting hard? - Be gone with thee! - I know you wanna fuck me like Mary! - I cast you out in the name of my Lord's name Jesus Christ! His power in his name, he treads you under his hell! (both shouting) (bodies thumping) (glass shatters) (discordant piano music) (dramatic music) (flames crackling) A priest's role is to offer a sacrifice unto God. That's his true calling. Oh, Lord. Lord, most high. Just as in the old covenant when the blood of animals was offered as a sacrifice and the high priest offered gifts and sacrifices for sins. I humbly offer my life, my offering. I sacrifice unto thee. (dramatic music) - We gotta get outta here! (all screaming) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (wind howling) (water splashing) - Yeah, let's see. These things in. Ha, I won't be needing that anymore. (sighs) Look at that. Never again will I toil in the hot sun like a mule. - Nestor, what are you doing? You can't just leave us with that thing! - Take us with you. - I'll make a deals with you. Y'all's idolatries aren't my problem. I ain't gonna answer to my master no more. Now you gonna gimme half that cash I know you stole. I seen yous through the window. Then I'm off to Tijuana. My chamber pot days is over. - Fine, you can have it as long as we can hitch a ride. You can drop us off somewhere along the way near Los Angeles. I'm supposed to be a model, you see, so. (Nestor chuckles) (lightning crashes) Just heat lightning, but supposing I'm wrong. We'd best be getting along. Roads flood fast when the rains come. (thunder rumbles) Best get ready 'cause if you ain't all saddled up in 15 minutes, I'm leaving yous behind. - All right, get ready. I'll get Jodi. (ominous music) Get outta the shower, Jodi, we're leaving! (water splashing) (dramatic music) (Jodi screams) (blood splatters) (mysterious synth music) - Were you also homeschooled by the Devil? - No, I wasn't. - Please, will you help me take this off? - [Peg] Of course I will. (dramatic music) - We'll devour your organs in Hell! - No! - Put me out of my misery. (Peg sobbing) - No, no! (dramatic music) (ominous music) - All right. What am I missing? Got my smokes, venison jerky, black licorice. (ominous music) Mary Joseph, don't take me now! (dramatic music) You're not real! You died a long time ago! (dramatic synth music) (Nestor whimpering) (gunshot blasts) (body thumps) (insects buzzing) (dramatic music) (blood squelching) (dramatic music) (door creaks) - Jodi? (Peg screams) (dramatic music) (Peg screaming) (girl giggling) (both gasping) - What are we gonna do now? - Find his keys, we're driving out of here ourselves! (girl humming) Oh, that is it! (machete swishes) (ominous synth music) (machete swishes) I am ending this myself! (Peg gasping) (car engine sputtering) - It's not starting! (car engine sputtering) (girl humming) (ominous synth music) (Peg sobbing) (dramatic music) (Peg screaming) (ominous synth music) - [Girl] Can you see me? (girl giggles) Can you find me? (ominous synth music) (girl giggles) (machete swishing) (eggs splattering) (Lori grunting) (Lori gasps) (bird creature hooting) (ominous music) - Lori? Lori? (girl giggling) (chair creaking) (dramatic music) - Life is not supposed to be good. That's all there is to know. Why don't you put the kettle on? Some dandelion tea sounds nice about now. What's that you have there? - It's, it's nothing! It's nothing. - Let me see. You'll be punished if you disobey me! Punished like Mary was. (Peg sobbing) (Mother Superior cackling) (insects buzzing) (ominous synth music) - Hello, Lori? The door is locked! (door rattling) (crickets chirping) (ominous synth music) - Won't you play jacks with me? - Now's not a good time. - I'm Mary's unborn brother. She put me in the outhouse when I was just a fetus. All the way down. Mother made her do it. Do they not love me? - That's a really sad story. What's your name, little boy? - I'm Aberdeen. It must be nice to have a toilet now. You should hide in the closet and don't come out until morning. That's when she goes away. Are you my mommy? - No, I'm not related to you. But I wish I was. Why can't all of the spirits be nice like you? - I like Heaven, but I wanna come back now. (child giggling) - Mother Mary, please, wash away my sins so that if I die tonight, I will bask in his eternal glory forever. Cleanse me. Cleanse me of, of my indecencies and and my naughty thoughts. I didn't wanna be in Hustlers. Not, not really. (ominous synth music) I'm ridding myself of this. Cheesecake photography. I'm ashamed. I'd hate for my mother to see. (suspenseful music) You see? You see? Is that what you want from me? Is it? (Lori sobbing) (ominous synth music) (cuckoo clock chiming) (dramatic music) (Lori sobbing) (ominous synth music) (Lori sobbing) (ominous synth music) (thunder rumbles) (ax thwacking) (thunder rumbles) (ominous synth music) (door creaks) (Peg screaming) - Join us. (Peg screaming) (Peg sobbing) - No! - Join us! (dramatic music) (Peg screaming) Join us! (Peg screaming) - The power of Christ impales you! (all screaming) (dramatic music) (light piano music) (water splashing) Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners from now until the hour of our deaths. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blesses the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God. Pray for us sinners from now until the hour of our death. Amen. (ominous synth music) - [Mother Superior] Peg, Peg! You've done it again, you wretched child. Penance, penance will consume the rest of your days. You can forget about breakfast. How dreadful of you to toil away the morning hours in this selfish fashion. Are you studying to become a nun or aren't you? Rise from your sinful slumber. - Mother Superior, please. I never thought I'd be so happy to see you! I was trapped in the most horrid dream. - [Mother Superior] I know. And it's time for you to go back now! (birds chirping) (ominous synth music) - Who are you and why are you wearing that? - I'm Bonnie and I just found this under the rubble. How do I look?
