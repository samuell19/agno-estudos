(engines revving) (engines revving) - Hi. - Hi. - Did you follow me here? - Do you have any plans for later? - I was about to go out for a run. (footsteps stomping) (tea kettle brewing) (pleasant piano music) (keys jingling) (footsteps running) (footsteps jumping) (shower running) - I'm just visiting friends in Berlin, I'm actually Polish. However after my gap year I moved to Romania. I'm a blacksmith and I've got my own workshop there. - Cool and what kind of stuff do you make? - Tools, fences, really sharp knives. - Sharper than the ones in stores. - Ah, yeah, much sharper. You can't buy those in stores. (horn honking) - I've gotta leave now but let's stay in touch on Instagram. - Yeah, I'd love that. - Yeah. This is for the coffee. - Bye. - Ciao. (upbeat music) - What's cooking good looking? - Oh, hey, I'm waiting for a date. - Oh you go girl. What can I get you ladies tonight? - I'll have a gin tonic. - And I'll go for a martini please, thank you. - Coming right up. - So, who else is coming? - Oscar, I met him on tinder tinder - Cool, is he hot? - Obviously or I wouldn't have swiped right on him. He's 26. - 26. Oh gosh, I don't think I'd sleep with someone young enough to be my son. - Bullshit, you know I like boys. I mean, not minors but the younger the better. As long as their age is not illegal, okay? - Well, those 20 somethings they are still babies. - Oh, they're so naive and playful, really I find that really interesting. - [Woman] And how's the sex with the one coming tonight? - Fantastic, except for his fetish, he's really into anal, so I have to fuck him with a strap on. - Some romance. - So you just meet to fuck? - No, I really like him. Why would you think that? You know, he's laid back and funny and charming. - Oh ho, for a woman like you, he has to make some effort. - [Nora] You're simply into older men. - Well, of course, I mean, the young guys they may have the better looks, sure but when it gets to a relationship, I mean, I'm much for the older man. You know, Andres, for example, my current boyfriend, he's 53. He's divorced, he has two kids. I am very much into experience, grey temples and wisdom, this roughness Like, you know, a real man, not children. - Disgusting, I can't stand older men. - Oh come on, Andres is very attractive He's from Vienna, you know? - Is he a cannibal? - Excuse me? - Vienna's full of cannibals. - What? - It's a thing. (women laughing) - Oh the Rothenburg cannibal was German Oh you mean the Natasha Kampush case? The girl was locked in by her father in their basement for about eight years. - Exactly, yeah, that's what I'm saying. - Yeah. Well, you know, I'm just, I just love this Austrian gallows humor. It's their very own sort of dark fun. - It's the only way for them to deal with their bad conscience of having given us Hitler. - Well I think I'd find your young guys way too inexperienced, sexually and otherwise. Cocky fresh flesh - I think interesting personality has nothing to do with age I've met some really precocious 20-year-olds. And I myself refuse to grow up, I'm a big child, you know? I'm sure I can spend hours laughing at TikTok videos and what's more one can learn so much from each other's generation gap. You know, opposites attract and all. - Regardless kids aren't all just innocent and playful as they can still be messed up. - You said it. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Mm. Ah, he says he's coming with his cousin. - His older cousin, I hope. - Well, I have no idea, I've never met him. - I'll be right back. - Hmm-mm. - Oh, hello, I see you guys met already. - I saw them entering so I just waved. I was sure one of them was your date. - Hello. - Nora- stunning as always and you smell good. Tobi - my cousin cousin. - Nice to meet you. - Enchanté. Nice genes you have in your family. - So what are you drinking? - I have a gin and tonic. - Martini. - Cheers. - Tell me, how old are you? - 19. (woman laughing) - Right. - I can show you my ID. - Oh, no, don't freak out, I'm not the police. (woman giggling) - So, how about a foursome? - Well, I'm taken, my boyfriend's waiting for me at home. - [Man] Just tell him you're going to be late. - I'm not dressed to play tonight, honey. - Who cares? - You're quite pushy. 19 and doesn't take no for an answer. - So you're coming. - Wanna see my nipples, they are quite sensitive (people laughing) - He's into nipple play. - Wanna see my nipple piercing? - Ooh, very nice. (people laughing) - Wanna lick it, I'll lick yours too. - You're a little pervert aren't you? - You bet, I'm also very experienced with older ladies. - Are you single? - Yes. - I thought you are not into babies, only wise old men. - I'm not, I am in an open relationship. - [Woman] Are you? - Truth to be told, my cousin's 17. (man laughing) (people laughing) - Relax, they don't mind.man. - [Woman] You're not allowed to drink that. (woman chuckling) My dear. - Yeah. - Thank you so much. (indistinct) - Goodnight. - So you are not coming? - Next time, Batman (woman laughing) (man laughing) - Well, let's go. (man hollering) (woman laughing) Wanna come to my place tonight? - Okay. - Do you mind if Toby comes with us, he likes to watch? - Mm. - I once watched him having sex with a woman in her 50s. - Was she attractive? - Yeah very attractive. - So come on, With you it will surely be more exciting. You are so hot and dreamy and special. (woman laughing) Many times we'll drink, ready oh. (upbeat music) (woman laughing) ♪ I drive all night ♪ ♪ I drive 16 wheels start it up fight ♪ (woman laughing) ♪ Here I fuck ♪ ♪ I'm rolling down the stairs too drunk to fuck ♪ ♪ Too drunk to fuck too drunk to fuck ♪ ♪ To drunk to fuck ♪ ♪ I'm too drunk to fuck ♪ ♪ I'm too drunk ♪ ♪ I know it's crazy ♪ (toilet flushing) (couple moaning) (phone message ringing) (engine revving) - Hi, you look gorgeous, may I make an offer you can't refuse? - Go on. - No, no, first you must promise to say yes. - I don't appreciate these kinds of games. - Oh wait, just give me a second wait here. Don't move, yes, just stay here one second. - All right. - Flower for you. (woman laughing) - Where did you get it from? So you were saying? - I came all the way from Egypt for a swinger party at my friend's place. - An orgy. - Yeah, so are you gonna be my date for the night and I won't allow anyone else to touch you. (woman laughing) - The jealous type. - Indeed. - Sounds interesting. - Do you have a pen. - A pen? - Yeah, to write your number. (engines revving) - I don't have a paper though. - Did I ask for paper. (woman laughing) - N for? - Just Nora. (engines revving) (upbeat music) - I'll have an (indistinct) please. (upbeat music) - Vegan-version, a friend of mine gave me like this recipe the other day and I was, I think I was trying it out. - Mm, it's very good. - Thank you. Hmm yeah very good... - Thank you. - Thank you for coming I appreciate it. Wow. - So you are single? - Yes. - [Woman] Nora is into younger guys like boys in their 20s. - So it's just sex. - No not at all. I'm always asked the same question. It's just what I prefer. How long are you guys together? - 17 years. - Wow. - Yeah. - Cool,an old school couple. - Yes. - Yeah. - [Man] And we've been married for seven. - [Woman] Yes. - Do you have children? - Yes, two boys. 16 and 4. - Cute. - So, how do you meet these young guys? - Dating apps or just like that on the street or in cafes. (people chuckling) - We often wondered if we are missing anything with all these new dating apps and stuff going around. - Did we? - Just asking. - Well, I feel really truly young for the first time in my life. I felt much older when I was younger. Back then I used to believe that I have to stay in a relationship even if it's toxic. Yeah, I just thought it was supposed to be like that, I didn't know any better. And it was also much harder to meet men. Yeah, so dating apps offer you new possibilities and real diversity of age, nationalities, professions, sexual preferences, it's fantastic. - So, how's it going with your young guys, your 20 somethings? - Actually not so great at the moment. Oscar just left to Leipzig for work. - [Woman] Oh pity, I'm sorry about that. - Yeah. - [Woman] What about his cousin, Toby? - He was into you. - Ooh. (people laughing) - Don't you worry, maybe you should. - Yeah, I'd better. - I don't understand your tastes or preference or however you wish to call it. The majority of young guys sees in an older women a mom. Now Oedipus Complex is not a new thing but with all the MILF porn these guys watch I think it's much easier for them to overcome their inhibitions and approach a much more mature woman as kind of a fetish object. Besides, they can't offer you any financial stability and they aren't interested in starting a family, so you're either being used for sex or you're on the fast track to becoming a single mother. - Have you considered therapy? - Anyone fancy a refill? - Yeah. - I thought so. - Great. - Okay. - You know the way I see it, men over 30 have already given into society's expectations but younger men on the other hand, the ones who are still on the way to becoming actual men, they are spontaneous and witty and creative. They have much deeper and undisguised understanding of sensibility. And what's more, experience doesn't always guarantee wisdom It does guarantee the readiness to accept compromise and self-denial and the loss of the ability to feel things so intensely. And I don't care about money. I make enough money to take care of myself. They could be getting pocket money from Daddy, they could be homeless, I couldn't care less. You know, I would take them either way. They can go and rob a bank. (people laughing) - Do you wanna see a picture of our oldest son, he's 16. - Sure. Sweet, he's very pretty like a girl. - What do you mean like a girl. - He's very similar to you. - Thanks. - [Nora] You're welcome. - Yeah, I wouldn't mind if he brings home an older girl than him. Yeah. - [Nora] Does he have a girlfriend already? - Only a girl best friend for now. But he speaks in one word sentences only when it comes to relationships. It's puberty. - That's sweet. - He's very good, he's a soccer player. (phone message ringing) - Hi. - Hey. - I'm Nora. - Leon, hey. So you wanna go inside? - Yeah. - Hello. - Hello. (upbeat music) - I study law and economics and (Magdeburg) this semester and I'm also training, I should say I'm training in hypnosis like my father, he has his own practice over in Friedrichshain. - Do you live by yourself? - Well, when I'm in Berlin I stay over at his place. Even though he turned my room into a storage space, but I still got my bed, so. I could show you someday. - Are you nervous? - Yeah, a little. I just, you know, I've just never been with an older woman before, older than me. My mom's just five years older than you are. And my sister and I, we stayed with her after the divorce. - Your eyelashes are so pretty. - But I'm not a pussy. - I never said you were. How old are you? - What do you think? 23. - And what does a hypnotherapist do? - I help people get through withdrawal and phobias. And I help my father with the (accounting). - I'm a claustrophobic, can't ever step into an elevator. - Perfect, than I can't help you. - Cute. Do you wanna have children? - No, I mean, maybe after I graduate and I find a proper job. - You know, if you have a dimple in the middle of your chin, then you're gonna have a girl. - Really? - Yes. - Well, there's the beard so you can't see it. - Then it stays a mystery. (doorbell ringing) - Hello. - Hello. - Come in. - Thank you. - How are you? - Pretty good, how are you? - Good. - So that's my father's flat. - Yeah. - That's kind of the living room area, you know, - Oh it's great. There's the kitchen and we eat here. Oh and that's like the heart of the flat, the balcony. - Oh. - Yeah, you can watch completely over Berlin, so it's really nice. - Are you a virgin? - No. Actually, I broke up with my ex-girlfriend a few weeks ago. It was a pretty toxic relationship with a girl my age. - So you're just seeking for comfort in an older woman? - Maybe. No, I believe that, you know, if it fits, age is just a number. - [TV Host] Of independent television station has resigned live on air. (keys jangling) (door slamming) (footsteps approaching) - Now here you are. - Hi. - Hello, I'm Nora. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (food frying) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (knife chopping) (doorbell ringing) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Hi, Paul. - Hi. - This is my girlfriend, Nina. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. (glasses clinking) (speaking in foreign language) - (Hey) guys, thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. - It's funny that their age difference is similar to ours. - You mean that you should be dating her? - No, I'm not attracted to her. What I meant was when it comes to dating, age is not an issue in our family. Shall we go inside? - Yes. (indistinct) - Nice, thanks guys. - So how did you guys meet each other? - I met Nina at a hypnosis conference outside the city. I know she's too young for me but I just couldn't help falling in love with her. - Do you think that my relationship with your son is inappropriate? - I find that's funny. - My grandma's against their relationship even though she broke all social rules herself once by marrying my step-grandfather who used to be a woman before he had sex reassignment surgery. (Nora laughing) - So you your step-grandfather is a transexual? - Hmm-mm. (Nora laughing) - Nice family you got here. - I know. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Here. - Wow. Oh look at his eyelashes, he's so pretty. - Right. - Oh I wanna make pictures of you both, do you think he'll agree? - I'll ask him, we're hanging out again next week. - Or you can invite him on Thursday at our party Emma and Moe are gonna be there. I'm sure you're gonna love them. - I'll ask them. - Yeah, great, please. - By the way, would you mind coming to pick me up after my social freezing surgery? - Of course I'm gonna do it, no worries. - I will give you the exact date as soon as I know. - Hmm, great I'm there. - Thank you. (engine revving) Thank you darling. - You're welcome. - Don't you (mumbling) you wanna buy me a new one? - No, don't have the money. - Preparing you some? - Hmm-mm. - You want one? (doorbell ringing) - Back in a minute. (upbeat music) Here's the boys. - Hello. - Hey. - Want a beer? - Yes, please. I'll sit here. - Here. - Put my bag. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You want one. - Thank you. - Oh. - You wanna try? - Yeah. - Be careful, it's a little strong. (man laughing) - I'll do it for you. - It's gonna be all right. (Nora laughing) Are you two together? - Yeah, she's my girlfriend. - How old are you? - I'm 38. - For real, you look like 20 something. - Thank you. (people laughing) That's the magic of a good work out and a good sleep and not having kids. oh and I quit smoking six years ago. - Cheers. - Cool. - You wanna join our snap chat group? - Why do you have a snap chat group? (people laughing) - Anytime any of us takes a shit, he sends a picture to the group and the other guys rate it. - How would you rate my artwork. - Ooh disgusting. - It's fine, though, it looks great man. - Dude, it's a nine. (people laughing) - Oh come on. It's probably a generational thing. - How do you guys know each other? - I went to school with Conrad. - Hmm-mm. - And I met Robert through Discord? - Yeah, yeah. - Discord. - That's a gaming thing. - Okay. - Like a PlayStation. - PlayStation, I don't that either. - What? - Is this also a generational thing? - And Robert's girlfriend got pregnant awhile ago. You know, a broken condom and they are gonna keep the kid. - Really? - They met on tinder and immediately clicked. so it's fine. That's how it goes bro. (people laughing) - Aren't you a bit too young to become a father? - Why should I be too young? - Well, if my question bothers you so much, then you're probably pretty much insecure about the whole thing. - What about you? Don't you wanna have kids? - Maybe, I'd like to focus on my career first. - Isn't it a little bit too late for you to have kids anyway. - Ever heard of social freezing? - [Conrad] Is that freezing your social media or something? (people laughing) - No. (people laughing) A woman can have her eggs frozen and stored at a clinic. I did it last week. Now I have three frozen eggs stored away and I can fully focus on my artistic career. Yeah and then once I'm established in my career and in a committed relationship, then I can use those eggs and become pregnant through in vitro. - That's smart. (dramatic music) - You sure? - I'll take a little. - All right. - I'm hungry, are you? - Yes. - All right, let's go get some food. - Oh thanks. So maybe I just skip this. - Yeah. - You know the way I see it, the reason why waste 15 years of my life raising a child when I'm not happy with my career. - Oh you have a point but I still think there are many women who want to marry a rich guy and have kids. I mean, women themselves are the ones responsible for the existence of (patriarchy). - Yeah, well, so what, if those women exist, still we should all have the choice to decide if we wanna have career before family. - Hmm, I get that. - Social freezing gives the woman the freedom for self-realization and to be with someone they truly love and not someone who's considered to be a proper provider for a family. - [Conrad] Uh that's true. - Men have biological clocks too you know? I mean, smoking and taking drugs are known to cause infertility. Maybe you should freeze your sperm too. - Me? - Yes, what do you think your sperm tastes like after all the things you take? - My sperm's premium quality dude. - Sure thing dude. You're the age-sensitive one not me. I need my glasses for that. Before we know it, - our planet is going to change so much you won't even recognize it. Thank you. Designer babies, you're gonna be able to pick out your kid's face features, size, gender. - It's gonna be sick. I mean, when we are allowed to decide to decide eye colors, it'll just be a matter of time before the next racial fascist fantasy becomes true. have you watched (the film Gattaca)? - Yes, but you know, I found the concept of limiting ourselves to naturally conceived children very outdated. Yeah, like wings, gills, different kind of organs to ensure surviving on other planets. Genetic (optimisation) and immortality. There's this jellyfish that if it's not eaten by other fish can just live forever. - What? - I mean, aging isn't a biological process, it's mechanical. - You should totally reproduce though, you have good genes. (Conrad laughing) - Thank you. (upbeat music) - I gotta get going. - Okay. - It was very, very nice to meet you. - It was a pleasure. - And thanks for everything. - Bye. - Bye. I have to leave now. - Hmm-mm. - Are you going home tonight or you staying here? - I'm gonna sleep here. - Okay. But I'll see you on Thursday. - For sure. - I'll send you the address. So ciao Robert. - Bye. - It was nice to meet you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I'm gonna bring you to the door. - Yes. - Did he tell you the story about the museum? - Yes I don't wanna hear it anymore. (doorbell ringing) - Oh I think (mumbling). - I think that you. - Is enough for you. - No, no, please don't. - Guys, meet Leon. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi, Leon. - Leon. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, Emma. - Hey, Moe. - Make yourself comfortable. - So anyone wants some tina? - Who's Tina? - Ice - I'm good on that, I'm fine with speed. - All right, anyone else? - No. - I've never done it before but I'll do it for you (indistinct). - Be careful with it, tina is really strong, stronger than anything I've ever done before and I've been around the block a couple of times. - She's gonna be fine, giving it in small doses. - Oh it's really strong, so be careful if I was you. - I'll try it mate. (indistinct) - Hmm-mm. - Leon, Martin wants to do a photo shoot of us, as a couple. - What kind of photo shoot? - Oh it's a playful one, so you shouldn't have a problem with being naked but it's not pornographic because pornography makes nudity dull and I try to make it interesting. - Sure we can try. - Great. - Cheers for that. - Yeah. Dance with you. (upbeat music) - Nora do you mind me playing with his hair? - Go ahead, darling whatever you want. - Can I touch your nipple? - Sure. - So nice of you to be here. So nice (indistinct). - Hopefully. - I'm good, I'm so (high). - How long are you guys together? - Together, together? - Like where did you meet each other? - Where? - Where, where? (indistinct) Really? - Yeah. - I really like how you dance. - Oh thank you. - Thank you very much. - Right, that is so nice. - Thank you. - Oh thank you. (upbeat music) - Let's go. (dramatic music) - You know, I've never been with a woman, what do you think of Ema? - She's very nice. - What do you think about a threesome? I think I wanna try it. - If that's what you wanna do, I'll do it for you. - I know you also like Emma I saw you looking at her earlier. - I don't know what you think you saw, but I'm not into her that way. I think we can have fun but only if that's what you want. - Okay. - And I think I wanna do the photoshoot with Martin alone just because you know, it's less pressure that way. - Okay. - In that case I have an idea, I'd like to shoot you surrounded by your childhood toys. (indistinct) - I'm fine, I always drive, just get in the car please. Get in the car. - Come on it's really dangerous, let's go upstairs and sleep at my place. - It's gonna be fine, all right, I promise you I bring us home safely. I promise you. Come on, close the door. (engine revving) - [Nora] Hey Leon, I'm really worried about you and all those drugs you take. I can't do this anymore but please know that I'm always here for you if you ever need help. - Fuck. I put it on walking instead of driving. Shit. So, you wanna put it in again. Thank you. - I think you didn't turn on the lights. - Oh true, that would have been interesting. (phone message ringing) Stop getting on my nerves, I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself all right? - Say my guardian is not at home. - Louder. - My guardian is not at home. My guardian is not at home. - Okay. - I love China. - Yes, you love China. - And I love high heels. - And you love high heels. - Hey guys. - I'll say it later. - Hey Nora. - What are you guys up to? - Well, we were having a moment. - I see. - Yeah. - And this is Hubert. - Nice to meet you Hubert. - Likewise. - And Hubert is a bitcoin miner. - Which means? - I add transactions to the public ledger of Bitcoin. I have to keep the blockchain consistent. Every time the transactions are being broadcasting, I have to group them into a block, then the block is transferred to a network and (validated by) recipient blocks. Those blocks are linked to previous broadcasted blocks. Thus you have a chain of blocks. - Now I get it. - Yes. - Nice suit. - Easy, hand made, my tailor is in Milan. I have seven of them in different shades of dark blue. - [Nora] Nice. - I'm sure it was a good year for the mining industry. - Hmm-mm. - And he also got waxed down there today. - Completely? - I don't feel pain. - Good for you. - Besides I hate sweating, uh. - [Nora] But hair removal doesn't remove sweating though. - Sure it feels cleaner though. - [Nora] Somebody likes to be in control. - Mm, I'm sure he loves to get messy too. (doorbell ringing) - I think that Lucky just arrived. Let me get him. - Not my hairs, not my hairs. - It's fine. - Whoa, hey. - Martin, Hubert. - Uh, hi. - Hey. - I brought these you know because I thought there was gonna be a big party. - It is a big party. - German, English, sorry I didn't ask. - Anything goes. - English is better. - Do you wanna mix it with Coke or just out of the box. - No, good like this, yeah thank you. - Want a glass maybe. - Oh here, you can have this one. - Okay, cool thank you. - Are you from Berlin? - Yeah, yeah, I'm born and raised in (Kreuzberg). My parents they were like these local hippies and used to take me to these Daime meetings, gatherings at a child. - What gatherings? - Daime. - Daime, oh fuck, what is it, it's this shamanistic ritual thing that they do in South America, you know they meet up in a forest and hop and dance and sing around a bonfire. I don't know. And then they drink ayewaska. - Ayewaska. - Sorry? - [Man] Ayahuasca yeah, that's what they drink. It's a psychedelic tea and you just trip your balls off I guess. I had some pretty amazing fucking near death experiences with it. - Get out. - Yeah. - Isn't it dangerous? - Yeah, very much so, yeah it is dangerous. The last time I did it, I thought I was gonna die, it's fucking amazing. - Why do it then? - I don't know. - Some people like psychedelics. - Yeah. - Others get high on money, equally risky isn't it? - [Hubert] I don't think you know much about money. - True. - [Martin] Lucky will you take me the next time you do the ayawaska? - As a matter of fact I don't live with my parents anymore so I guess no. - Oh please. - I'll take her. - All right, going back to the boring stuff, do you study or work? - At the moment I just retook my (Abitur). I'm pretty proud of that yeah. You know, I missed out on a lot of school as a teenager because of drugs and shit. Yeah, I actually even sold guns at one point. - Which is probably also very dangerous. - I was selling guns too, (centrefire) rifles for hunting. - I can believe that. - I went myself a few times hunting for red deer in the (Fichtel Gebirge). - Did you kill any? - No, didn't have any luck. - Well, that's getting too morbid, like killing deers. Guys can you name the seven deadly sins in German? - Seven deadly sins, hmm. - Give it a try. - Yes. - Sloth, for an example. Speaking in German there you are, you're back. - Yeah it's drunkard and for example, lust. - Do you have a lighter. - Yeah sure. - Can't you name them? - The lust, Speaking in German - You like that? - Did you make that yourself? - Sure, I make everything. - Free, just like your (indistinct). - I make all of it, yeah. - Are you into women or men. - Women obviously. - Obviously. - She's a man though. - I think so. - Oh Lucky. - I'm just saying. - My goddess. - Your goddess. - You never know the way it is. - And I think you're repressed. - Me? - Yes. - Oh, express yourself, don't repress yourself. - Martin wants to sing. - Oh yes, do you want me to sing. - Yes. - Yes, we do yes, yes. - Well, if you want, if you insist, put it on. - Put it on then. - Put it on. - Are you ready? - Open it, I'm ready. Singing in Italian (group clapping) - Bravo. - Whoa. - That was great. - Beautiful. - Thank you. - It's classy. - Yeah, thank you.

Nora, yep move a little back backwards, yeah, lean stretch your neck a little bit more. That hand is really good there, lucky, keep it on the back and push exactly. Oh that's it. Show me some neck, Nora. Go around. Yeah, that's really good with the back, exactly. Now keep your hand on the ass. That's good yeah. This one's really good guys, you're doing good job. Perfect, that's good. You can turn, you can kneel. Yeah, do a jump. Hold his face, that's it. That's a good contrast. Yes, yes, that's it, that's a great (indistinct). Play with each other, really good. Yes, yes, that's really good. Exactly, that's what I want. Yes, grab her by the waist exactly that's it. That's it. - Can I see you on Wednesday. - I've got football training on Wednesday and I'm on the starting team, so I can't really do Wednesday. - Why can't you? - Perfect, perfect, we got that shot. Good. (slow music) - I don't know if this is too early to say this but I think I'm gonna fall in love with you, like really I love you honestly. - I love you too. - Can I kiss you? (slow music) - I'm pregnant. I'm calling you from my gynecologist. It's my decision to keep the baby. (crowd chattering) (upbeat band music) (slow music) (cheerleaders cheering) (people chattering) (cheerleaders cheering) Lucky, Lucky! (cheerleaders cheering) (rain pouring) (phone message ringing) - [Lucky] You can't really do this to me. Do you know it was an accident. Yeah, I...
