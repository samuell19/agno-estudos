Harbour lights, the deep purple night, the junk sailing upriver is a boat of dreams I will never forget the sound of the kokyu (string instrument) on those Chinese nights on those dream nights. A Kazuo TAKIMURA production Script by Hideo OGUNI Cinematography by Akira MIMURA Music by Ryoichi HATTORI Theme song China Nights (Columbia Records) sung by Hamako WATANABE Starring Kazuo HASEGAWA as Tetsuo HASE, Yoshiko YAMAGUCHI as Kei RAN, Kamatari FUJIWARA as Senkichi YAMASHITA, Tomiko HATTORI as Toshiko MIURA Directed by Osamu FUSHIMIZU It's been a while since we were back here in Shanghai. Our first steps ashore! Why are you complaining? Hey! Bro! Hase! You could at least answer! Stop going on and on! (unclear - invitation to a place?) That's not really my kind of place. Come with me to another place... Just go home! You're no fun! You damn con artist! What did you say? What the hell do you take me for? You, stop it! This woman says I haven't paid but.. What did she say? She's not that kind of person. She didn't get the money. What! Liar! I'm certain I gave her the money! She says you said you would pay! What! Look. Calm down. You're Japanese, aren't you? Look around! Everyone's staring! If you strike her Chinese people will feel badly towards the Japanese. It's none of your business! She's picked my pocket! I'm just punishing the wickedness! If you don't they'll show no respect towards us Japanese. Can't you hold yourself back? You must know what's going on in the world at the moment. The Chinese here judge all Japanese based on us! We've a responsibility to be restrained in our behaviour, even more than normal. Don't you agree? Forgive me for interfering but let me pay for this. I happened to be passing, and didn't want to get involved. It was just an accident! Put up with it! I don't want to bother you. - Please allow me! Don't do it again! You think you can just look down on me? Of course you tried to be kind to me, but I know you're up to no good. If I don't do whatever you want me to do, you will just beat me and yell at me. You are all jerks! I won't be fooled by you again. I won't be fooled by you again. Sir, sir. Don't go. I need to talk to you. Don't go. It's not over yet. What? Is she still here? Look... What? She's obligated to you since you helped her and she insulted you. I need to pay back the money they lent me. However much they owed him, I have to pay him back. What did she say? Well, the gist is that you can't help her and then just walk away! You DO surprise me! Does she want money? - I don't want any favor from the Japanese. She says that she owes you. And you've lost out, through paying. She doesn't want to feel obliged to you, to owe you. Take me back with you and I can work for you. She wants to go to your place and do laundry or odd jobs until she's paid off the money. It's too much trouble. Tell her no! I don't want any favor from the Japanese. She says she doesn't want to feel obligated to a Japanese. What? She doesn't like it because I'm Japanese? She seems to be pretty anti-Japanese. I think it's time Hase-san was getting married. I agree. How about... How about Toshiko MIURA? For Hase? - Yes. She wouldn't be displeased. It would be a good match. - Mum, can I go to my room? It's not just "not displeased". She's been doing his washing! The ostensible reason she stayed in Shanghai was hakamairi (grave visit) for her brother but actually... But the problem is Hase, isn't it! I'm not sure he likes dominant women! He has no vices to spend his money on! His only vice is smoking. I'm back. - Welcome back. Madame... I'd like to let you know that she'll be staying in my room. Hase's brought some woman back with him! Senkichi, what's going on? Well, like he just told you. Who the hell is that woman? Madam, is the bath still hot? Yes. Go take a bath. Bath. Downstairs. End of corridor. What are you waiting for? Go and have a bath. No. No? I can't stand your dirtiness. Come on... There must be some reason. - I've told you! I don't know what he thinks. Hase's being odd, isn't he. ... Hey! Come look at this! Right. You sleep here! Make yourself at home. Go to bed. Why won't you? Oh! Because I'm here? I'll go and sleep somewhere else. You can relax and sleep here. Here's the key. What are you doing? You've made a mistake. I'm not that kind of woman. So she really hates the Japanese. Hence she's absolutely anti-Japan. Is she? That needs to be addressed and corrected! - Shh! I think there must have been reasons for her to be like this. And I, as a Japanese, have decided to fight that part of her. I see! As an individual Japanese I've decided I want to show my sincerity and see if our two peoples... If the Japanese and Chinese peoples, really can't be in harmony. I think you're doing absolutely the right thing. Let me make this clear. I don't want to be a freeloader here. Why don't you hire me? I can clean the house, cook, do the laundry, or do whatever you want me to do. Alright. If that's what you want, I'll let you. Let me help you to some rice. No. Just leave me alone. I can do it myself. Why doesn't she like it? If she doesn't like to... let's go to the... what's it called... Mankinro (tourist site)! And to Raoshuu (restaurant) No! - Are you sure? You always turn everything down! Don't worry. I know I am able to... Bro! What? I believe this woman Keiran will be quite hard to handle. Why do you think so? Well, for example she understands Japanese. How do you know? She listens intently when you and I are talking. She wouldn't listen so intently if she didn't understand. Really? It's just one thing... but it's indicative of how very strange she is. Thank you. Miss, is that you? Du Amah! Miss, have you been able to stay safe? How have you been? Yes. Du Amah, how about you? Miss, how are the master and madam? Father and mother... My father was hit by shrapnel. My father was hit by shrapnel. How come? Mother and I were fleeing for our lives, but I didn't know what happened. Miss, you poor thing. How could this happen? I kept looking for Father for a long time. I've looked everywhere. I put up a missing person notice. It's been six months. But I haven't got any response yet. I'm afraid. The only thing left is rubble, nothing but rubble! Wow! It's a bride's kimono, isn't it? It's beautiful! I think it would suit you? Please come again when you need us! Welcome back! Toshiko, that suits you really well! Yes, it does! Stop messing around! Keiran? Hase brought this for you... Keiran! Why won't you take it? What's the matter? She's got a fever! Call a doctor! How is she? It's exhaustion! Extreme exhaustion and psychological damage. And she's seriously malnourished. Can I help? Shall I go and buy some ice? Let me know if there's anything to be done. Thanks but Senkichi bought some and we've still got plenty left. Don't worry. You can go to bed. Come on, let us do something too! Thank you. Your offer to help really means a lot. You're actually quite a nice guy! In which case give me a discount on my rent! You always try it on, don't you! Father, watch out! Watch out! No! No! Another bullet's coming! Burning...burning.. Mom...mom.. How come it burned so badly? Mom...mom.. Poor girl! Hase-san, never hits me! Even when I behave badly. And that's hard. That makes me suffer! Hase is a good man. You must be tired. Shall I take over? No, It's fine. I'm fine. Well, OK. If you're really sure... My father died. My mother is gone. The blossoms are out. How beautiful they are. Father, did you see how beautiful that blossom is? I am going to pick one. - Go ahead. Yes, I will, but let me pick some flowers first. Dad... Mom... Dad... Mom... That's Keiran! Keiran! What are you doing here all alone? Nobody at the hotel knows you're here, do they? You didn't tell Hase-san you were coming, did you? Hase will be worrying. Hase? What's it to do with him? Look around! This was my home. My home! My home used to be envied by the neighborhood. It was a happy home! I was born and raised here. I lived here peacefully with my mother and my father. But... Look! There's nothing! Nothing! My father... and my mother... It's rubble. Just a heap of tiles! Who did this? Who did this? Who? I'm so sad. I'm full of hatred. I'm sorry I brought her to this house and involved you all. Let's not follow her. It was all a bad dream. No, we can't do that. Please look for her. I feel really sorry for her. She's been so starved of love and affection. The terrible experience she's had has warped the way she thinks. She's so unfortunate. You should make her happy! You're the only one... Hase-san. The only one who can do that. Toshiko! If you say that... you know what it means. Keiran! I knew you'd come back. I'm so glad. I still owe Hase-san. That's the only reason. You're completely soaked. Take off those clothes! This is hot arrowroot is a local speciality where I come from. It will warm you up! Here you go! I will not be taken in! You're trying to trick me! I will not be taken in! Keiran! Hase! Now I have finally hit you! I've lost. I overestimated my will power. I'm an arrogant clown. Please forgive me. You can leave and go wherever you want. Hase! Blame me! Forgive me! It didn't hurt me. Even though you hit me, it didn't hurt. I'm glad you did it. Glad! I'm glad you did it. Glad! I'll behave well. Please let me stay here! Forgive me! This is very beautiful. Do you like it? No, you don't have to... - Of course I do. How much is this one? - This one? No, no. The one below it. The blue-green one. The blue-green one? No, no. The one below. Yes. That's the one. It looks good on the lady. It really suits you. It's cute. Shall we have this one? How much? - 15 yen. That's cheap. Keiran! What's wrong? Nothing. You look so pale. What do you think? Something's wrong today, isn't it? No... errr... The nanny who brought me up lives really close to here ... Can I go and visit her? Of course. Let's go. He says he's brought the car to pick you up. As Keiran asked him to. In case you're suspicious he was told to show you this ring. She didn't feel like coming back alone. Hang on a moment. So, where is she? I don't believe that this is from Keiran, what do you think? This place is not easy to find! Thank you so much for coming. I am Keiran's younger brother. My name is Zhang Zixian. I am Hase. Please sit down. Where's Keiran? Keiran? She's over there. Soon, in fact in the next few days a boat registered to your company... is heading somewhere upriver, laden with explosives. I want an answer about where and what time it will leave. We already know how fast the boat can travel. Sadly, I've heard nothing at all about it. You must have a good information network if you know about things that even I don't! There's nothing you can do but answer my questions. We're used to interrogating Japanese. They declare they won't tell, but after a few days of continuous work on them they do. Let's not waste each other's time. I will give you two minutes. You know what will happen after that. I know. But unfortunately I don't know the answers. And... I wouldn't tell you even if I did. Two minutes... during that time... That's not much time! What shall we do? You hang on and keep watch here! You have one minute and 40 seconds. One minute 30 5 seconds left. Oi you! Take that! I'm Japanese, you idiot! Looks like we were in time! Hase! Hase! Come on! Are you OK? Are you all right? I shan't forgive you! Don't hit her! Senkichi, when I was hit it was Keiran who turned out the lights! That's what comes of walking around on your own! You'd better stick close to me! What's going on? What's happening? Keiran and Hase are getting married. It was a sudden thing last night. I suppose you could say we are some sort of matchmakers! I'd like to do something for them. Where are they? I sent them into Soshuu to have a nice memorable day out! This view is like a dream! Yes... And for us to be walking here together feels as if it's a dream. It may be a dream. That there could be this much happiness in the world is hard to believe. If it is a dream I don't ever want to awake. I pray to god that this happiness will go on forever. Hey Mister! Let me take a photo. Come over here, quick! As I hug you to my breast I hear boat-songs of my dreams and birdsong The willows sob as if regretting Spring and the falling leaves in Soshu Should I comb your hair? Should we kiss? You entwine your fingers Peach blossom A hazy moon as if were tearful The bell rings out at Kazanji (Kazanji = Kazan Temple: the kanji mean ?cold mountain? Keiran! Every time I see water I remember a Japanese poem. A Japanese poem? I'm not sure if your Japanese is good enough but Listen carefully. - OK Reflections in the water show me the sad beauty of impermanence. Our love and the flesh are but bubbles on the stream. I am low and coarse and grief-stricken but my love for you is pure. Haruo Satoh's poem Do you understand? - No. It's difficult. Say it again. They're back! They're back! Where on earth have you been? These are gifts for your new home. This is a coffee set! Hase likes coffee so you need to learn to make it delicious! This is just a little gift. It's pretty! Thank you! All the presents have been for the bride so I'll give one to the groom. Wow, Senkichi! You own some nice things. It?s hard to find a 1910 model Elgin these days. I have one myself... and I... This is one that I really bought! Thank you. A package for Keiran. From Toshiko Miura. I wonder what it is? There's a note in it. Keiran, this is a present with all my heart. Please wear it for your wedding. I pray with all my heart that both of you will be happy. What a night in China Harbor lights, Deep purple night, Ah, ship, The dreamship I can't forget The sound of the Kokyu Ah, China night A dream night. Where did you learn that? Toshiko Miura was always singing it. So I heard it and... I see! So that's how you learned it. Ah... China Nights Shanghai What a night in China, Through the window a willow, A lantern was shaking, A red birdcage, a Chinese girl, ah, sad love songs... China Nights! Nights of dreams... Hase! I'm sorry to come so late. Congratulations! - Thank you! And congratulations to your wife! Keiran, I'm afraid I have to say something cruel for you. I've received orders. What is it? You've been given important orders. It's very hard for me to tell you this but... Japanese will always proudly and bravely face duty when an order is given. you have to understand this Japanese man you have married. Midnight! in 50 minutes. Hase, I expect you to follow orders. Yes, sir! Bodhisattva, please protect my husband so he can come back safely. Hey! Keep right! What the hell are you doing? Get back! Look out! Watch out! Careful! Thank you everybody! Ikeda-san, what's happened to Yamashita? Where's Hase? Mrs Hase... Hase won't be coming back. Ikeda-san... I am so very sorry about Hase and Yamashita. I'm so sorry about what happened. But I can tell you your husband fought marvelously. I feel like I've lost my own son. When I see you there's nothing I can say. No. It's not possible. Not possible! Ikeda-san... Tell me it's not true! Tell me it's not true! You're all winding me up! Please! Please tell me it's not true! Please! That he should die and leave me all alone... It's not possible! He's alive! He promised me that he's come back alive! He's never once lied to me. He'll definitely come back to me. Whither the flowing water carries those leaves tomorrow but the reflection of the two of us will never fade Dear God, why didn't you help me? Why did you make me suffer so? Why? Why? The reflected light shows me the sadness of impermanence I know my flesh is as bubbles on the stream and so is our love our griefs ... Keiran! Keiran! Darling! Soshuu Nocturne - the end
