Farewell Johnny There's a stranger in our midsts. - Catch him! There's someone coming here. - Hang him! God protect us from the unrighteousness which lays ahead Righteousness, where is it? Give it to me! No, the treasure's mine It's a horse... a rocking horse. Give me the horse I'm going to take it to the middle of the moon. I think she'd like a horse. - We must tell the Doctor. Here, everything's here. There's a stranger in our midsts. My horse, it's mine, mine, mine They won't take you away, you hear? It's you and me and you... It's broken! Rotten! It's the angel of the unholy. He's here. Look. Dead. - Where is he? Quickly! She's at the front door. - I'll go get it. I'll... Look, you stand dead still or I'll shoot! He's in the hallway. The enemy is imanent There he is. Pleased to meet you. - Here is the patient. Welcome. He's been in a catatonic state for a month. Here is the file. - Thanks My son is a professor at the university. A junior professor. You know, he's a scientist. He's always worked very hard, they say he's a brilliant professor. He's overworked. I say you need rest. He's just a little tired, it's caused by all the studying. Then he doesn't speak. All the years just worked. He's my child. Talk to us son, please. Tell mummy you're not insane. Like a Christmas tree. - He must take off his hat in the court. He stands over us watching. - Steady now, Aunty. Shameful. - You can't say I didn't warn you. Sit, old boy. Boy? I am a durban coolie Alright, you just make sure the young boss get's his fork and knife! I know what I'm doing. Boy! My name isn't "boy" Boy or no boy... errr... Give him food! Listen Englishman, it's nothing to do with you. Everyone has the right to speak. - Someone will have to help him. Please now boss, my name is James. I will help you. It's you brother-brother that's the problem. You, off to the kitchen! Your place isn't amongst white people. They go to school until 13 and still they wonder about like an ape in the circus. Tomorrow when that sun comes up I'll chase you into the sea! Shame on you You're a handsome man. Look at me. I'm a lovely woman, aren't I? Watch yourself, keep a close eye out. You say nothing? Think you can fool us? You won't fool me. I know, I know everything. You hear me? I've found you out. You come here like a thief in the night and think I won't notice? Stay there where I can see you. Watch yourself. Watch out. There's no arm. This arm doesn't work. But I have a mouth and feet and I can speak and I don't hide away. If you'd also like to live, it's easy. I know you've seen him but we all see things. There will always been problems. If I was minister she'd have her horse. I'm coming. I'll give Franzie new hands. You aren't the man in the moon! Moon? He's come to take me away on a horse. "...he's take me away on a shiny horse with a brand new saddle..." Here I come with my horse... and I'm coming to fetch you. "...'cause I said if you want me, then you have to come and fetch me..." Did you hear me? He's left me a treasure in the moon. "...the monkey climbs the hill, so zealously and in a rush" Stop right there I see you. He's landed on the left hand side. And on the right hand side they're waiting. He's there! It's that train! It's come to collect us! My cats! My dear cats! Chase the cats! Brother, the train's boarding! He's sleeping now. It's a mistake, it's the wrong train. You should climb off. It's just Koos, he's always like this when there's a full moon. Come, Madga, here's more cats. - Bring them. 96 of them, I want them all back. 70, all 113 cats. Hear me, Koos Leibenberg? Stupid cats! Come here you little fuckers... I'm going to give it some milk. We could have left at 9 if that "boy" had opened the gates, but no! Boy! Now he wants to stand around and talk like a white! Lift your arse! He is in 8th grade! I have to get the cats while he's lying around out back! Here take the cats but I hold them all by myself? My word, now he wants to talk. Well, Mr. Daily Mail! What's the paper tell us about our country? It's so frustrating under this present government. I have a thing to tell you? Who's reading the newspaper while I'm searching for cats? Hang him up! Hang him up! Yes! Don't get all worked up! You bastards that will be the day! Hang them! Let's play in the corner. Oh you're not playing the game either. They murdered the Judge's daughter. Come look, it's a mass hanging. Come and look here. Did you ever pick up your brother's ashes like this? Under the full moon? They blew up trains, you know? And our first brother on the train? I see you listen. We all have our own story. Lies! Lies! You all lie about everything! Look at him he's off his head. You're probably ruining all my plants here! He's the reason I'm in politics. Didn't you know that? Thirteen medals aren't enough but I'm waiting for next year. You didn't know I have friends in the cabinet. You lot just cared about the money as usual! Eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth. That's right! These people wearing hats walking around and now it's yes please boss. It is not because we're superior? Guilty! Yes, exactly thats it precisely! Oh brother you're going to witness something you've never seen before. And Jamesy? He'll sit in the cabinet. He's not a bad nigger. They want to turn niggers into ministers? Give them some running shoes, sunglasses, a briefcase, golf clubs That's Linda's And a 1, 2, 6 my brother. I'm going to pull them into line. Isn't it beautiful? Lindas birthday on Friday. Here I am! Here I am! Happy birthday! Come and see what I bought you. That's not a real horse, I wanted a real horse you can get a real horse if you're well today. Excuse my health-here take it. Come ride your horse. Will I go to a place where there's no sin? Then the lord will love me too. God does love you. No he doesn't, Dad says he mad with me. So who is God then, Doctor? Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Because God has blessed you. For you, the loveliest. Tell me then, who is God? My chest hurts too much. Why doesn't God love me? But he does love you. He's loves us all. He loves the Doctor. He loves James. He loves the cats and dogs. Cats! It took seven years for this flower to bloom. That is so, isn't it Doctor? The lord also loves the insane or what then? Yes. Guess, guess, guess. You are my man, yes? "...we'll walk together under the moon..." "...what will your mother say?" "No, he's gone back to the moon..." - It's just a doll. My doll. I know. Now he's gone. The dolll's just lying around somewhere. No, the moon brought it for me! My Father said... he took my horse away. He punished me. You're back! My doll is here Where's your face? Don't worry I'll get you another one. Where were you? Tell me. Where.... were... you... naughty. Where were you? Laugh for me, laugh. The wood, its strong. I'll have to cut out your tongue and give you a new one. It's sore. You must laugh. Don't! I must! You're my doll. Linda, please don't kill me. She didn't understand. I miss you, my son. They said you've spoken. Talk to me. Just say "hello". Say "university" anything. He's going to his final year. You know he's going to Pretoria. He's such a good son, we always pray for him. Linda? She's been damned. Remember how she screamed last time? She's a lovely daughter, well mannered. Been well brought up, I can see Have you repented, child? Don't know. Haven't you gotten down on your knees? To ask forgiveness? Mercy for what you've done? I saw that cad the other day at the hotel. The royal-disgusting! We think of you every day. We brought you up so well and then you're spreading your legs. It hurts me too. It's I who has to live with this shame. It's me with the daughter in a nuthouse. I'm sorry. - Too late for sorry. You've upset your Father terribly. - Take me away please take me away. Say something. Just for your mother. You know, your Father isnt there anymore. I'm alone. So here we sit like monkeys on a ledge now we'll sit. Yes, its just like before the war. ...in the last days there will be wars and upheavals. So says the word. If they detonate the bomb, then you're all alone, nothing. Guilty or not guilty? Guilty His mercy is great. I blew up my brother! Guilty! There is no redemption. What if he's as understanding as us? And just sits here? It's pitch black and nobody came or will ever come? Shameful! My friend in the cabinet has forsaken me. Next year you will see something! I will be first minister. I'll come visit you. Thank you, my son. It is you! I searched for you. Did you find me? I don't know. I'm not really here. But I am. Where are your horses? Far away. Show me. It's too far. Is it a rocking horse? Yes. Pink? Yes and with a brand new saddle, and you said? Yes, that I would come get you. But I am! Take me then! Whats your name? Linda. Johnny, so you didn't come to fetch me? Didn't you come to fetch me? I don't know. You're scared like the other boys. I know everything. Be careful. Listen to the wind. Linda don't run away he will hurt you. Run. Don't listen to him. Tell me. Are you scared of me? Say yes. But you arent the man in the moon. But you're running away. But here I am. You see, Linda? His hands? He's touching you. Linda don't, be careful You're warm. People are warm. You're nice. Yours eyes. The light I smell you. I kiss you. I kiss you. No! He's Satan. Linda don't He brings heartache, he brings the dead. Watch your cat! This is my house. Broke my glass. You think too much. Who knocked over the tray? What do you want? Happiness. Happiness? You Magda du Pree? Yes, happiness, rest for my soul. The stranger must get out! Hes a patient. It's my house. I don't want the dead here anymore. I cut my hand. You're not listening. Not one of you listen. I'm sorry. Come. I might as well give you your injection. The truth will yet come knocking at my door today Johnny is sick, Aunty. He lives here. P-please Doctor. He stays, Aunty. Nobody here has arms. Can't you see? - You're just like me. Yes, I walk and I talk and I eat and I sleep and in my dreams I have arms that can pick up and hold. Why are you here? - I've been hidden away here. Was I also hidden away? Just Linda and I. Me because I'm ugly and Linda because she stayed a child. And her parents? Johnny, its a mad house down there. Madhouse? A house of madness. Like the madman who locked his own wife in a cell until she was as insane as him. Take a seat. Is Linda also insane? Stay away from her. She thinks the dolls are her children. Linda kissed me. Many a bride has kiss her husband only to later discover he's insane. I have big news. I'm busy making a dress. Like Christmas when we eventually go to the moon. Whats in the moon? You, of course. You're in the moon. "You said, that I want to have you..." You're in the moon. "That I must come and fetch you." You filthy thing what have you done, you've eaten it all up! You idiot, you hippie. Where have you put my plant, where is I? Out of my way, put that woman's dress away you hippie. A moment Doctor, do you know who you're talking to? I'm not just some nobody. I have friends in the cabinet. Don't get yourself all worked out. Savage! Communist! Dont think I don't read newspapers You're gone, come back. I want to come along. Just have to wait then. But you said you would take me along. The time has come. Hear me kitties? The cats! I waited for you. The cats, did you paint your face again? Red Indian paint? It's blood. You're a handsome man. It's all blood. You came to bed in the end. Cats arent making any more noise. I did what you said I must do, my man. You're a good woman. No. No, don't speak. Come, come sleep. Whats your name? I don't know. She's coming at Christmas. Christmas. She was born at Christmas Is she you? My daughter. Jenny, you came to visit mummy? No Jenny, your fingers are so clumsy. Its very easy. You can't do it from there, theres just too many dolls. We can get James to help. But he's a kaffi-.... He can take that one. This one? I don't want to live here. I want to go to Linda. We need to work this madness out of your system it makes a sick person an insane person to have 100 cats. All you can do is kill them all each day. You won't kill the sickness though. Don't know what to do with the sickness of people. You helped me. Last night. My face. Who are you? Me I am a man. I waited for you. All day already. Is it your house? Where's your face? Here? It's gone. You lost it. Here it is. Look. Can I sit? Where are you? Here I am, man in the moon. My horse, its here! Don't run away! Wait for me You said you would take me along. I won't tell anyone, I promise. I want to speak with you. I must know if I am well or not. When you can walk among normal people. I don't want to go back. If you're well then you must go back. Whats going on outside? We can talk about it tomorrow. Want to talk about it now. Please. I don't want to become insane again. If we're honest I say you should run away. To your mother who does with you what she wants. And when your Father killed himself you hid away. And then when you failed and came second best, no you're too scared to go back. You just want to hide here. You want to cry on my shoulder and you don't have the guts to go back into the world. You're wrong. I learned to love in here. Don't you know love? Please Daddy. I won't do it again. I'm a bad girl. Checkmate! You've won again. How did it go tonight? I lost! You were wrong. You lied, it wasn't pa who wanted me to study. It was you. And its not women that are bad. It's something in you. Hes not coming anymore. This time I've learned to love. We're waiting for you, I even painted your room. The Doctor said you would be ready for next term. I made you new pillow cases. You've come along so well. You can come home if you like. I told him you were just a little overworked. You're my son, I know you. It doesn't work anymore. Things are different now. Here. Merry Christmas. I must be honest you always were. Remember at school when they broke in... I am now a man! A man who would also like a wife. I would like to laugh or just talk with someone else. Just like anyone else. I am going to become a man. You are nothing! I made you what you are. George phoned. He and Jane can't come. It's better that you leave now. Merry Christmas. Help! Help! Help! Care to dance? No, not on Christmas day. But New Year's Eve. Dance with you all night. And then I'll dance with Linda. No. And then again with you. No! And then Linda again. No, you only dance with me. You're mine. I want to... With Linda. You're mine I want to marry you. I don't want you anymore. I just wanted to find out. I was curious. You're a woman. Don't you understand, a woman! And I am a man. That's all. There's nothing! Get out of my coffin. Hear me? I need it for the new year. I am sleeping beauty. You must get out. I am not your child. But you are my child. I gave birth to you. Koos must get the wood. You're a horrible person! You have thousands of cats! You're a witch! No. You're ugly, ugly, ugly! I'm not... You are Why does Uncle Koos have an allergy? I don't know. Please just don't hang him, hear? He's all that I have. If you leave again, I'll die. I won't, I can't Your doll? She's getting married. And the other one? Who is she? Me. Why do you want us two dolls to marry? Because they're in the moon. How'd they get there? He took them on his horse. Who am I? I can't say. How come? Whisper it in my ear, I love you I waited so long for you. They won't be allowed to marry. My parents said the same thing. I dreamt I married too. They sat here. The brides table was here. The guests were down there under the trees. Jakob built this house specially Linda's parent will never allow it. When we tried to cut the cake one of the cats landed ont it. And then they wouldn't eat it. Jakob said the cat would bring us good luck. It's been ages since you laughed. It's been a long time since I've been lucky. Johnny's visiting tonight. But Johnny has been here all along. He's coming to visit Linda. All proper. We must just make sure. Your cats here to bring us some luck. The cat didn't bring us any luck though. All I know is I'm mad. I know I am not the boss of my own house. I know my family let the Doctor come here. Later the rest of you came to my farm. I know so much and can't do anything about it. That day the cat sat on our wedding table, that night the warnings began. I thought I'd come home early today Aunty wants me to shave and get dressed are you finished? Yes, Aunty it works like a bomb. Perhaps we won't use it after all. You talk in riddles. Tell me then what does the newspaper say about the new year? Maybe I can still prepare my speach for tonight. I don't believe that its necessary for me to warn you against the dangers outside or inside. Because all these dangers will be a bagatelle compared to the yellow terror in the east and the black danger from the north. Thank you, you have a place in my heart. Yes what I wanted to say is... What are you laughing at boy? I think you left out the coolies tonight. I didn't forget I was just getting to that. Honoured guests, family, bystanders I was about to say... The wagon is in the ditch a pleasure the pleasure is mine. Well friends, as I was saying... well... The danger excuse me a second my throat tingles. Yes boy I'm looking for you! Now you must tell us about the conservative types riding in the donkey cart yes, yes, yes, precisely. I've had enough get me the water I need. In this time of war, we can't afford to sit on our hands. And the married among us know what problems can occur under a blanket. Sshh, he's getting serious now. I'm speaking from the heart now and its not politics. You know I fight with the boy every day. Why? Lack of will power, because he has black skin? Not at all. Because I love him really. Because we know each other. Because the black man and white man have always known eachother as christians. Him in his place and me on mine. I have decided I won't fight with my brother anymore. I know you will probably stone me tonight, but I must do what's right. Boy, I know you have a black skin, I know you're too big for your shoes. But all I see is your heart. Take my hand. No, don't, I'm black. I am sorry, boy. I won't hurt you again. Come laugh with me. Tomorrow is a new year. Come laugh, boy. I see the warnings each night. One of us will die. I don't want it to be Linda. Nothing will happen. Don't forget it. Now you can't escape. I'm finished thinking. I need to know you can see I am a man. I'm waiting for you. Do you understand that I'm not the man in the moon? Do you know why I'm here next to you? Kiss me now. Do you understand? You woke me up. I slept for a hundred years. The witch cast a spell on me. This is not a story. I am Johnny. A person. A man. You aren't the prince? Are you the man in the moon? You're just lying. It's you who imagined it. I have always waited for you. I am a different story. A true story. Is it a nice story? It's the story of a man who fell in love with a woman. You need to hear it. I love you. I don't want them to take me away. I'll stay here. The lord won't punish me will he? He won't promise? Kiss me like a man. Come let's dance now! Don't think about that story again. Remember you are my story. In your story I'm not a witch. You and I. Nobody else. Everyone wants help some will find it, others won't I won't bother with the counselling anymore, just give them pills and injections. If there was just one thing I could say or do to make someone well. But every time I look up the symptoms... nothing! She let's her dance to her new riddle... Boy, turn that record over! "O' Brandy makes me stand" That's enough of all that dancing-here's to the new year! I'll keep going til daybreak, bring out the cabaret! That so-and-so dancing with white people gets my back up! Find love first, I know, its easy to say I love my parents even though they have forsaken me just words. Try Franz! And if I can't? Then nothing. -And if I can? - Then everything! I think I can! Are you sure? I can only try once. Far from the world, kitty... He let's her turn, he let's her turn, she loves her new puzzle. It's New Year! It's New Year You must leave now. Happy New Year baby. You too. Are you sleeping, Liz? I already know. Liz is dead. "Far in the earth, kitty, kitty, kitty, my kitty over the sea." "She lets her turn, she let's her sway, she likes her new puzzle." For you I found it by the dam. I'll put it away with her other things. She waited for me last night. But I was with Linda. And I with Franz-we all have excuses. Not making excuses, I want your help You don't need my help. You're well Don't you want to hear me out first? -No! You must I have five sick patients, you're healthy. Running away Doctor? No. Is your mother well? I want you to listen, you must investigate Linda, she's getting well. Are you listening? Linda is a child. Is it your files which say so? I'm very busy, Liz is dead! Linda began to live last night you're running away Linda is certifiably insane! And the insane watch over the insane? We try. I know injections and pills. Thank you, Doctor. I'll try alone. Maybe my love is stronger than your pills. I waited for you. I need to have a serious discussion. Look how nice I made myself There! This is your horse, you need to feed him every day. Come here, Johnny, come sit here with us. Here's your chair. But we're going to the moon. First we need to have a little chat. I'm going to sit by the door please don't take him away again The warnings you're mine because we kissed. Don't scare Linda, please come sit here. No, no. You'll kill him. By the neck until he's dead What do you want to know? I want to know why Liz is dead She injected herself It's not true Was it your fault, Johnny? It was, it was the fault of many Guilty or not guilty? Guilty! I don't want to cast the first stone And me? I blew up my brother Murderer! We're leaving now Don't move or I'll shoot. Murderer Tell me it wasn't your fault. I can't talk amongst this chaos. Linda's crying. Listen, what chaos? You know who you're talking to? Yes, with the first minister. That's better "give a person some respect!" How? I never had a son. I wanted to give you my daughter I didn't hate you anymore Your money won't free you! He said he loves me Did you do it, Johnny? What did he do? Guilty! Guilty! The witch has been burnt! Murderer! Murderer! Guilty! He turned into a frog Are you guilty my child?
