subbed by Aramis You're not here, but the flowers still bloom. 2002.5.7 Because I miss you, because I miss you so much. Because I cannot stand it. 2003.4.5 Merry Christmas 2003.12.24 Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. Is it really goodbye...? 2004.3.25 2000, Choong-chun I got here fine. Right now? I'm sightseeing. I should have gone with you. How's the boarding house? Good. Are you done unpacking? I'm really fine. Hey! Kang Wook, run! Get them! My bag? I'm leaving. Drive safely. Don't forget your medicine. I know. I think we found a good place for you. And the grandmother here is really nice. Right? If something happens, call me immediately. I'll come as soon as possible. Okay. I'm leaving. Drive safely. All right. Bye. Be safe. Call me. Kang Wook, you were hella cool today. Here. Those Dong Gang High kids are probably all pissed off right now. Stop acting so cool, man. What's this? At the student store. While buying mine. Thanks. Hey Jung Ho Tae. Step outside for a moment. Hey, is Yoon Ja Kyung's mouth the only one? I like sandwiches, too. Step aside. Jung Ho Tae. I'm sorry each time, but... Lend me some money. I don't have any. Don't have any? Yeah, I don't have any. You always say you don't have any when you're going to give me some anyway. You said it was the last time before. I did? I said that? I can't remember. Do you have amnesia? Hey. When are you going to give it to me? Tomorrow? Hey asshole. Don't you have change from the sandwiches, asshole? Even if I had some, I wouldn't give it to you! What? Man, why do you make me, at our gentlemanly school, use my fist! Search him. Stand up. You have a lot of money! Why are you lying? What the hell are you looking at? Tell me you're sorry. Come down. Bell's gonna ring. All right. We get a new homeroom teacher today. I don't want her hating you, so come down. If she doesn't hate me, do I get something in return? Hurry and come, okay? And stop acting so cool. Me? It will be difficult, but I ask of you. How could I as soon as I get here... A month from now is winter vacation. Just until then. A warning: there are a few widely known troublemakers in that class. Teacher's coming! Who's the class rep here? Straighten. Bow. Good morning. Hello. Nice to meet you. My name is Lee Yool Joo. I'm the homeroom teacher while your regular teacher is away sick. I hope we get along. Yes, ma'am. Oh, sit down. Hello. Yeah, nice to meet you. I'm really glad to see you. Your kicks were awesome yesterday. You guys were good at fighting, too. First time hearing praise from a teacher. Oh. Wait. Lift your face. Did you guys hit him? No, we didn't. Did they hit you? No. He said he wasn't hit. Quiet. Tell me the truth. Did they hit you or not? They didn't hit me. Are you laughing? Why are you laughing? There's air in my stomached! Again? Stop it. You're shocking the teacher. Shall we, then? Why did you hit him? Teacher, I wasn't hit by Kang Wook. So you threatened him, too. Why did you hit him? I didn't. Does his face look fine to you? I told you, I didn't. I should've known when I saw you fighting in the streets yesterday. All of you, stand in the hallway. Right now. You go too. Not being able to say you were hit, that is a fault as well. Go out. All right, this is my first time, so shall we do introductions? Who wants to start? She has a killer body. Big breasts and all. Maybe she stuffs. Why the hell are you crying? Next. I'm Yoon Ja Kyung. Is that all? Yes. Then can I ask you a question? What's the one word you always keep in your heart? Can we just start class? Our finals are coming soon. This is part of class. Talking to a complete stranger, and... getting to know me. Hey, you'd better stop. Hey, stop. Stop it. He keeps crying Why are you crying? You've never been punished before, right? Because I'm embarrassed, asshole. Are you acting? This is kinda cute. Why are you so embarrassed? I'm different from you guys. I really hate you. I really hate being treated the same as you. I really hate you. What are we like? What are we like! You're bad guys. Human trash. Parasites. Cockroaches. Why are you hitting me! What are you doing? You stay here, everyone go back inside. You don't have your nametag. What?s your name? What?s your name! Suh Kang Wook. Don?t I look like a teacher to you? Nope. What? Suh Kang Wook! Stop right there! Gold medal winner of the Kang Won University watercolor painting competition Teacher Lee Yool Joo? Yes? Good job. Your voice could be heard from next door. Made me feel good inside. Those guys will never go to college, so take things a little easy. Since you did that from the start, they won't start any big trouble any time soon. Teacher, why did Suh Kang Wook miss a year of school? Skipped without a reason. He actually is not that dumb... Then again, fighting requires smarts, too. Father was a college professor. Died of an unknown reason, or something. He?s always trying to act so cool. Sometimes rough in action. Had mental trouble due to father's questionable death. I had quite a welcoming party, didn't I? I called you here because I want to know about Suh Kang Wook. You made a mistake. What? Kang Wook did not hit Ho Tae In the morning. He was late coming from the roof. I saw him. Why did you say something? Kang Wook doesn't like for me to meddle. He wouldn't like me saying this to you either, but I hope you won't look at him differently because he was held back a grade. You met him yesterday, right? I?m saying this because that seems to be influencing your thoughts about him. I didn't. I said I didn't. I don't look like a teacher to you? Nope. What? Suh Kang Wook! Stop right there! I was drinking well that day. And that man came and said he would pay my tab. Said let's have a cup of coffee together. Because of that damned cup of coffee. I was so drunk, I don't remember anything. How could a guy who raped me while I was drunk not have 10,000 dollars and then sue me back? Mr. Prosecutor, I'm really guiltless here. I think 5000 could solve things. Was it room 506 or 507? 507. Oh it's written here. Sam Jung motel room 507. It?s Sam ho motel. Ah, Sam ho. You said you were so drunk you didn't know what was going on, right? Yes. How do you remember the motel name and room number so well? Did you think we'd pity you if you said you were the victim? November 28, 2 am, you met the guy and had consensual sex in room 507. Next morning, you sued him for 10000 dollars! He sues you back for fraud. You acknowledge this, right? Weak to pressure, and shows no signs of feeling remorse. Take her away! Hello Welcome It?s done? Yes, please wait a moment I?m home. You worthless jerk! Where did you sleep last night! This thing is really tough. How many times was that? Wash up and come in! Yes, ma'am! Hello Grandmother! Grandmother! Suh Kang Wook! What are you doing here? What are YOU doing here? This is my house. Is this a teacher visit? This is your house? What are you two doing here? Grandmother, the grandson who goes to my school is him? I couldn't introduce you since he didn't come home last night. Say hello. She?s boarding at our house. Have you two met? I?m Kang Wook's homeroom teacher. Really? Is that how it is? This is kinda weird. Why is that crazy bitch smiling? The shameless bitch that made her son an orphan when her husband died! And on the very same day he died! My poor son who didn't know why he was dying before the age of 50. This is all because she came into the house. I told him she would end up eating him up. She deserves to die twice! Deserves to die! Though they say you live the way you look What a poor and pathetic life Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Kang Wook! Kang Wook, don't go! Kang Wook! Mom! Mom, mom! Please get up! They must be your parents. Your door was open. Your mother was a beauty. Who's that cute boy? Let me see! Do you need something? You want to get some air? Why? I heard you didn't go to you classes today! So? I?m asking why. Because I didn't want to. I think I misunderstood you in the morning. You should have told me you didn't hit him. I did. Oh right, you did. Is this sandbag yours? No. Then? It was my father's. Why did you bring this? I?m going to leave it there tomorrow anyway. I was bored. Did the ceremony go well? Yeah Where are you going? I?ll take you home What are you doing here? Without even calling me? I suddenly wanted to see you. Is it okay to stay here? Looks shabby. No, it's good. You lost weight. Liar. That?s what I?m saying. I had a hard first day today. Your mom's not home? She went to Seoul to see my father. It?s a weekly routine. She was leaving, all dressed up, when this thought occurred to me Is she going to bust my dad, the married man? Why are you looking at me like that? Because you're pretty. What? You don't know why you're pretty, right? Go in. You?re not going to tell me? Later. Kang Wook Let?s go to college together. If you want I can help you In the past, you got better grades than I did Yoon Ja Kyung It?s good that you're pretty. But don't overdo it. I?m leaving. I made a mistake, right? But they were the kids fighting in the street yesterday How he could just walk out when his teacher, homeroom teacher, said she wants to talk? Stop talking about him Why do you keep talking about him? Don?t talk about other guys in front of me. He?s not a guy, he's a student. He?s a male student. Hey Yool Joo. Huh? Give me your hand. Pretty, huh? Is it too big? It?s big. It?s okay, I?ll just wear it. I?ll rematch it and get it to you. That?s fine. I?ll just wear it. I set the date for Saturday. What date? Dinner with both our parents. I talked to your mother yesterday. Tae Hyun. How could you decide that on your own. You?re gonna be up for the weekend anyway. And you already met my parents. Still. You should have discussed it with me first. I tried. But you kept hanging up on me because you had class. I can't that day. I?m on duty. Change it. Yool Joo, do you really have to come here to be a teacher? We already discussed this. You can always teach after marriage. I?m just scared you'll faint - I?m fine. I?m not fine. I?m worried. Mr. Prosecutor Kim Tae Hyun, I really hate it when you treat me like a patient. I hate it. You are a patient. Hey Yool Joo! Lee Yool Joo! What?s wrong? I told you I?m not a patient. That's what you think! I understand how you feel, but you're still a patient to me. Teacher! Teacher! Please leave a message after the- Yool Joo, it's me. About earlier... Are you okay? Are you really okay? Yup. I do this once in a while. When I?m under stress. I?m weird, huh? Kang Wook, if this ever happens again Will you just watch me silently from by my side? Don?t faint in front of me. You were really heavy. Suh Kang Wook! I?m sorry about earlier. I?ll apologize. I made a mistake. I?m sorry. Here. I said I?m sorry. You do what you want. You misunderstand on your own, apologize on your own. Let?s go. How can I send my kid to school? This is not the first time. What are you doing? I?m really sorry. Hey, bastards, tell her you're sorry. We?re sorry. What the hell! What the hell are you looking at? Good morning. Good morning. I?m not doing so well. Didn?t I tell you I would report you to the board of education if this happened again? I?m really sorry. Kick these kids out. I will not let it slide this time. Beg for forgiveness! I don't want it! Kick them out at once! Hello, mother. I am Ho Tae's homeroom teacher, Lee Yool Joo. So? There was an unfortunate event in our class yesterday But I already punished them, and I?ll keep an eye out in the future. Look here. I have something to say to you as well. Why do you punish the kid who got hit as well? Are you really a teacher? Mother, my name is Lee Yool Joo, not "you." And Ho Tae didn't speak the truth- Are you protecting the bullies here? I?m not protecting anyone here, I just - Teacher Lee, that's enough This happened in my class. Let me take care of it, please. Taking care of it would be kicking these kids out. Parents have no say in who gets kicked out of school! Stop this at once! This is not something you can handle. Ho Tae's mother, if something happens to the student, I, the homeroom teacher- The homeroom teacher The homeroom teacher You should have discussed this with me I said, this is not something you can handle Go back to your seat Hello? Mom Have you been well? Yeah And you? I?m good, of course. How?s the school? Is it hard? It?s good. Nothing big happened, right? Good, thank goodness. I?m having tea with Tae Hyun's mother right now. Wait a moment. Yool Joo? It must have been hard to move by yourself. Tae Hyun didn't go, did he? He went yesterday? Oh, he did. You guys, if one person messes up, all of you do mass cleaning, understand? Yes And you, too! What did we do wrong to have to clean this huge school? They say meeting a good teacher is one of the five blessings. Let?s hurry Why doesn't she have to clean? Did they let her off because she's pretty? I?m so sorry, teacher! My hands are slippery and I dropped the Trashcan. Think of it as your initiation rite! It?s okay. But you should be more careful. What is this? Thanks Oh my, teacher! Did something happen? The kids dropped the trashcan while cleaning. I smell, don't I? Take a shower at the gym Oh, can I? Thank you Think of it as your initiation rite! I told you to stop. This is not something you can handle! Are you really a teacher? (singing a Kim Hyun Jung song) There?s no life without faults, but when you age you'll realize, it's all the same. Grandma, I?m home You worthless kid, why are you always so late? Did you eat? Of course I ate. What is there to eat outside! Eat at home when it's time! And the teacher? She?s not home yet? Why didn't you come home together? I don't travel with girls. Crazy bastard Baby, want me to steam you some yams? I?m fine. Grandma, go to bed. You said you can't even see. Are you worrying about me? Grandma, I?ll get you some glasses in the future. And a gold bracelet? Of course. Thank you Oh, Kang Wook? Oh, right, right. Thanks for earlier. Wear it. It?s snowing hard. I like that it's snowing hard, but why on such an embarrassing day? Why are you laughing? Do I look funny to you? Don?t laugh. No matter what, I?m still your teacher. I smell, don't I? Yes. I didn't wash my hair. Does it stink? Yes. Cotton candy. You smell like cotton candy. Kang Wook, teacher drank because I felt a little stuffy in the chest I didn't eat all day but my stomach was hurting like indigestion. I don't think I deserve to be a teacher As soon as I came, I misunderstood you I got yelled at by the principal, and the kids are ostracizing me Do you know what my dream was? What was it? A super good teacher Do you know what my dream during school was? An ultra, jjang, awesome super good teacher Know what my dream is now?
