Grandma, did you see the fireworks last night? I didn't know we could light them in November. Ugh. We're out of Tasty Whip. Maybe we could squeeze in a Freddy's run after your flu shot. [Beverly] I bet the world would be better if people shot fireworks every night, don't you, Grandma? Hey. Maybe we could get some and light them tonight. Oh yeah. Absolutely. We'll stop by the illegal fireworks stand right after we get those matching neck tattoos. Hmm? Did my mom have neck tattoos? She had a neck. She had tattoos. She dropped out of school. All things we can agree we're not going to repeat. I'm not going to have a neck? Have you done your homework? Yeah. Except I'm not sure about this poem. Like, should I write about my life now, or life how I imagine it, or world peace, or if socks feel lonely when their partners are lost in the dryer, or... I'm sure it's fine. Poems are just weird ideas people forget to keep to themselves. Oh. Remember, I'm picking up an extra shift starting this week. So... I'll be safely unsupervised at home with the doors locked and my homework completed. Good girl. First Moody to go to college. - You think you could feed a pig bacon? - I think we're late.

I sell songs. [inhales] Not bad. What's this, "The song that reminds me of the day on the hill"? I thought it was a song. You steal this off somebody? It was my parents'. The tape broke, and now I wanna get the songs. Your parents have pretty good taste. [clicks tongue] I have some of them. I don't have that. Nope. I mean, nobody has that one. So what do you think? CD or vinyl? I'd go vinyl. You know, if you have the stereo for it. Do you have them on tape? I only have a Walkman. Just one second there. [door squeaks, closes] What are you looking for? Your DeLorean. Flux capacitor acting up again? Hey, you can't just pop back into the '80s and pick a tape up there. Do you have any money? Okay. Sorry. I was sweating. Wonderful. Wonderful. All right. One song. Which song do you want? Whichever is the best. Didn't you say it was a mixtape? It's from a tape of songs my parents put together. Yeah. Then you have to listen to the songs in order. Okay. A mixtape is a message from the maker to the listener. Right? It's not just about which songs, but in what order. Microseconds between segues, tempo changes. Does it fade out? Does it fade in? Doesn't matter to you? Okay. All right, "Getting Nowhere Fast," Girls at Our Best! Great. Hands off and stand there. A message from the maker. [rock music plays] I put the first song on an old tape. The rest of it's an AA meeting, which is free of charge. It's good advice if you ever wanna get clean. All right. So we're gonna do a dollar for the tape, a dollar for the song, labor. We're gonna carry the four, got the Pythagorean theorem, and then with taxes, that comes to 5 damp dollars and 63 cents. Exactly. Thank you. Great. Now, get out. By the way, I'm Beverly Moody. What's your name? Anti. Anti? Anti what? Anti pretty much everything. Including you.

[breathes deeply] It was fun to dance to. You danced? I watched. [dogs barking] [refrigerator door opening] Did my mom dance? If you call crazy gyrations dancing, then yeah. Yeah. When she was little, she wanted to be a Solid Gold dancer. [sighs] Maybe she could've been one if she was alive today. - [rock music playing over phone] - [fridge door closes] Yeah.

Just me and my grandma. Oh. Back in New Jersey, I had, like, two million cousins. That's crazy. Why'd you move here? Hmm. Because of my dad. He didn't like his old job, so we came here. Now he doesn't like this job either, but my mom says we can't move all around like vagabonds, so we're staying. Has anybody given you a tour of the neighborhood yet? No. No one really talks to me. I could give you a tour. I've lived here my whole life. I know the names of all the dogs, and which ones you can pet, and which ones will bite you. But first, can you do something for me? What? [Beverly] So you listen to this and tell me what it says. Okay? [Ellen] Okay. [man on recording] The road might seem long and arduous.

[Ellen] Uh... Can I still get that tour? [both giggling] [whimsical orchestral music playing] That's where two men live, Les and Ray. They dress their dogs in sweaters, even in the summer. I asked him once, "Why do you dress your dog in sweaters even in the summer?" And Ray said, "Fashion before comfort, sweetie." [both giggle] Animals wearing people clothes is pretty much my favorite thing in the whole world. [loudly] This corner is famous. It was on Cops once. This guy got pulled over, and he was like, "I don't have no drugs." And then the cops were like, "Then what's that pipe doing on your seat then?" And then he just started running, and they caught him by his ponytail and arrested him right here, and he just kept hollering, "Call my old lady," over and over. - [exhales] - [Ellen] Did that really happen? [Beverly] I watched it on TV with my grandma, but she turned it off. [Ellen] How come you live with your grandma? [Beverly] Um, 'cause my parents are gone. [Ellen] Where'd they go? [Beverly] They died when I was two, so I never really got to know them. [Ellen] How'd they die? [Beverly] Car wreck. [Ellen] Huh. [Beverly] Hey. What's your GPA? [Beverly] Grandma. [woman] Yeah? - Can I have a friend over? - Huh? I'm Ellen. I have a 3.87 GPA, all my shots, and parents who'd never let me watch junk television.

They never miss out on a chance to point out life is a living nightmare. Are they worried about Y2K? - Hmm. The millennium bug. - Yeah. Yeah, no. Uh, my dad actually hopes that things go haywire, and all our debt gets erased. - Mmm! - And, um, hey, you know, if the world really does come to an end, at least we don't have to keep suffering. Oh. This is delicious, Mrs. Moody. Oh. Thank you. I, um... I grill the Spam. It really brings out the salt. - Hmm. - Hey. Wanna see something cool? [Ellen] Oh. Okay. - Thanks, Grandma. - Thanks for the dinner, Mrs. Moody. Uh, girls... - [footsteps receding] - [sighs] [Ellen] They don't look like parents. [Beverly] My mom had me when she was 16.

This is me with my mom and dad. - [Ellen] Oh. - I never really knew them, but the other night, I woke up and saw someone trying to shoot bottle rockets. And then I found this. - I think it might be a sign. - [gasps] A message from your parents? Yeah. But I'm not sure what they're trying to tell me. I think I have to find all the songs before I'll know. Hmm. Have you told your grandma? She gets kind of weird when I ask about them. I mean, I know she loved them, but maybe she blames them for messing up their lives. - Hmm. - Besides, she's got enough going on. - Hmm. - [sighs] I think I can help. It's this new thing called Napster. All the songs are free. [Beverly] Wow! How do you know about this stuff? I don't really have friends, so I spend a lot of time on my computer. - Which song do you wanna hear? - Just the next one. I have to listen to it in order. It's, like, mixtape law. And if there really is a message, then I need to listen to it the way my parents made it. [Ellen] Cool. All right. [inhales] Uh... [whispers] Okay. [keyboard clacking] [computer quacks] Hmm.

[sighs heavily] I actually don't know how that went. I wanna know about Mom. Maybe she wasn't a good student or good daughter, but... Who said she wasn't a good daughter? But she was my mom, and I wanna know what she was like. Did she like Slurpees? Was she ticklish? Over or under for the toilet roll? [laughs] She did like Slurpees. - Okay. - Yeah. That's great. Slurpees. Uh, me too! - [exhales] That... that's a great start. - Good. [silverware clatters] What else you got? [emotional music playing] Like, what did her voice sound like? Um... Hmm. That was a really long time ago, honey. Uh... Let's... let's just let this one go. Okay? Oh. It's gonna burn. [sighs] [birds chirping] [gasps] [gasps] [breathes excitedly] Grandma! [rock music playing] [chuckles] Wow! So this is everything your parents left? Yeah. I guess my grandma felt bad. - [snorts] - [laughs] Your parents were so cool. Yeah. I don't know what happened to me. Well, sometimes it skips a generation. Look. She wrote songs. Or she erased songs. Wonder what went wrong. Hey. Uh, why did your parents have creamed corn? I like creamed corn. Oh. I've never had it. Oh. I found it. Oh. What? "That song that reminds me of the day on the hill." "April 17th." "First date with Zack." "Climbed the 1,000 steps, swung and touched heaven." "Played 'More Than This.'" "I kind of hate myself for saying it, but I think I'm in love." [both] Aww. - [Nicky] Ew. - [both giggling] "More Than This," what's that? - I don't know. We have to listen to it. - Yeah. We can do more than that. You wanna know about your parents. Right? You have to live like they lived. Eat the creamed corn. Yeah. Eat the creamed corn. No, you nerds. We climb the 1,000 steps. We play the song. We swing to heaven, whatever that means. What 1,000 steps? In Greenwood Cemetery. It's haunted. It's also across town. - Yeah. - My grandma knows every shortcut in town. I bet I can take us on an optimal path. [all panting] [Nicky] Dude, there is nothing optimal about that. [Ellen] Yeah. How haunted is it supposed to be? You know, it's cool, you know, if you're scared and wanna turn back. I hear the way you keep spirits at bay is by telling the truth. Like, as long as you're speaking the truth about yourself, then they can't touch you. Is that an Asian thing? - Anne Rice. - Oh. My name is Beverly Moody. And I'm pretty sure my feet stink. That's not what I meant by truths. I... And I wonder if my parents' feet stunk, or if they smelled really good. And if they had cool friends. And if I would've been one of their friends. - Like, if they met me today. - [insects chittering] [birds cawing] Um, if there are any spirits out there who know them, would they have liked me? [emotional orchestral music playing] I have an irrational fear of the movie E.T. - I have sleep apnea. [sniffles] - [Beverly] What's that? [all giggle] S-Something about his wrinkled little body induces me to throw up. [Beverly giggles] [Nicky] I once technically died for 45 seconds until they slapped me awake. I have a crush on Pat Sajak. [laughs] - What? - Seriously? Wha... No judging. I hate raisins. Deep truths. - [Nicky] I have a hangnail. - Deeper truths. I don't have my period, but everyone thinks I do. - Seriously? - Really? My mom leaves a box of tampons by my room every month, and I pretend to use them, but... honestly, I'm a little freaked out about the whole thing. Once I stole one of my grandma's tampons to put it in a glass of water to see what happened. It got huge. [Ellen and Nicky] Ugh. [Nicky] I am never using one of those. [Ellen] No way. I'm just gonna wait mine out in the bathroom. [all laughing] [Beverly] Dude, I totally thought you already had your period. [Nicky] No. I just look moody. [Beverly] No. I'm Moody. Beverly Moody. [giggling] [Beverly] I like you guys. A lot. Yeah. Me too. A lot. Yeah. Truth. [giggling] Oh. [wind gusting] - [Beverly] Look. - [all sigh] Whoa. [all giggle] [Beverly exhales] Whoa. So cool!

[breathing heavily] Your mom was totally memorable. Great voice, great musicality. [panting] If she stayed in the business, could've been a serious contender. But she dropped out of the scene, and I never heard from her again, which... maybe was the right choice. Oh, gosh. What are you to them. Huh? I'm not anybody.

[melancholy music playing] [Beverly sobbing] [sniffles] [whimpers] [sniffles] [whimpers] [sighs] [sniffles] [exhales, sniffles] [sobs] [man on PA] Today is the last day to vote for the school mascot. - Remember to vote today. - Owl or Wildcat. One vote per student. [teacher] Got your quiz grades from last week. [Nicky] Bev. Bev, come on. We can't quit now. It was a stupid idea. [sighs] Ellen thought you'd say that, but... They weren't trying to send me a message! They were just two dumb kids who made a dumb tape! [class murmurs] [footsteps approaching] Are you two responsible for this? A mullet on Homer? [class laughs] It's an insult to one of the world's most famous poets. No. We weren't making fun of anyone. We think the mullet's rad. Plus, it's an egregious act of vandalism. - Dude, we had nothing to do with it. - Yeah. - Whate... - Mullet, mullet power! [students laugh] Now, we are removing any votes for your third-party mascot. Hey. That's unconstitutional. Let's just keep politics out of school. All right. Please go back to your classrooms and learn. Beverly. May I have a word please? Now we are all aware of your circumstances, so this one time, we're gonna let you off with a warning. Mm-hmm. But, Miss Moody? [inhales] Think about your future. [soft piano music playing] - Grandma? - Mm-hmm? [sniffles] Are you happy? What kind of question is that? Never mind. I don't wanna talk about it. Is this some kind of drug? Look, I-I saw it on 60 Minutes. Okay? I know that these stores are fronts for selling drugs. You must belong to Moody. Yeah. And I wanna know what this F. Capacitor is that you're selling to kids. Well, your granddaughter, Moody, came in looking for a song. So, needing to enter something into my cashier machine, I decided to go with something I thought was both sarcastic commentary on the situation and also an homage to what I think is the greatest movie of all time, Back to the Future. So, needing to put something on the bill, I put "F. Capacitor," flux capacitor. I don't want Beverly coming in here anymore. And... And I don't want you selling her F. Capacitors or anything else. Okay? Yeah, lady, more than happy to oblige. [exhales] Great. Yeah. 'Cause she's been nothing but trouble since she walked in here. What? You should know something. She was fine before this. She was. We had a routine, and... and she liked sweaters. [whispers] I think she liked sweaters. She smiled. She smiled, like, all the time. Okay? I'm sure it's all because she listened to music. It's well-known that rock and roll causes kids to worship Satan and hate sweaters. [Gail] That's not funny. - [door opens] - [doorbell chimes] [door closes] [Anti] Lady! Gran Moody. [Gail sighs] Listen. I like Beverly. I don't know why, but I do. And I'm probably the last person you should take advice from on this, but she's obviously searching for something, and... [inhales deeply] ...maybe just take it easy on her. That's it? That's your advice? You came out here to tell me to take it easy? Yeah, yeah. I guess. Huh. So maybe I'll just let her run wild. Huh? Yeah. And maybe she'll get pregnant at 15 and then get in a car crash and die. [truck door closes] 'Cause that's what happens. You know? That's what happens when you "take it easy." People die, Mr. Record Store Guy. Thanks for the advice. Wildcats! Wildcats! Wildcats! Wildcats! Wildcats! Wildcats! Dude, why are you icing us? - [Beverly] Why are you following me? - We're friends. Are we? Ever since we started hanging out, my grades are slipping, I'm sneaking behind my grandma's back, I went to the principal's office for the first time, I found out I ruined my parents' lives. All kids ruin their parents' lives. - That's why your friends... - We're not friends! Or if we are, it's just because we're all losers. And after everything my grandma's done, I'm not gonna throw it all away and end up like my mom, making the same mistakes that... Your mom didn't make a mistake. What? Your mom totally made a mistake. Look how she turned out. - [air hisses] - [crowd gasps] [air hissing] Mullets rule! [principal] Beverly. Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales, I wonder if I might take a moment to talk to you about Steven's bullying. [Steven] Huh? Wait. What? Thank you. [door opening] [Gail] No! No. - [door closes] - You are not going anywhere until you ex... Suspended? No. You're grounded. [Beverly] Okay. Oh. You're, like, next-level grounded. Like, you're not gonna see your friends anymore. - Okay. - Like, ever. Okay. You're supposed to be the good one. I guess I'm just another mistake in a long line of mistakes. What are you talking about? I screwed up Mom's life just like she screwed up yours. [sighs] No, Beverly... Am I wrong? It just seems like everybody in this family is either unhappy or dead. Go to your room. Perfect. So we can avoid talking about my mom again. I gave you an entire box of her stuff. What more do you want? I wanna know if she and I would've liked the same things. Who cares if you would've liked the same things? Because then I could know if maybe she would've liked me. [breath shuddering] Of course she would've liked you. She had to love me, but she didn't have to like me. I like you. Do you? [sniffles] When was the last time I made you laugh? Oh, honey. I'm too busy to laugh. I know. And I know everything you're doing is for me, but sometimes it just feels like... Like... [whimpers, sighs] ...you have no idea who I am. [melancholy music playing] Oh God. Yeah. [doorbell chimes] [pop music playing] So, how long have you, uh, been... Angry? Alone? Here? Here. Sixteen years. [Gail] Oh. Postal worker of the year? [sighs] Eleven years running. Except '96, they gave it to Earl Boggs. Yeah. Well, he had cancer, so... - Mmm. - Yeah. All right. I have to ask. Did you really think that I was selling drugs? No. [scoffs] Eh, maybe. I don't know. I don't think you have to worry about any of that with Beverly. She's a good kid. Absolute pain in the butt... [chuckles softly] ...but she's a good kid. You're doing a really good job. She's a great kid, but that's no thanks to me. Mm. She's getting into these years when I don't know how to keep her good. I should take off. - [Anti] I, um... - No. I've lost people close to me too and wasted years not dealing with it, and looking back... what I regret the most is I hid from the people that were there, and I stopped noticing them and letting them notice me. [inhales] Thanks for the Tab. - Cheers. - Cheers. Yeah. - Yeah. I'll take that. - Okay. Yeah. I'll... I'll keep that. [Gail inhales] All right. [melancholy jazz piano music playing] [Ellen] Hey! [Beverly] Hey. This is, like, the first time I've seen you outside in a while. Yeah. - Suspended. - Mm. I'm not supposed to hang out with you either because you might be a bad influence. But then I stare-dared Justin to take a bath in butter, and my parents forgot about me and my impressionable, young mind. Mom's still actually cleaning Country Crock out of his ears. Ew. [Ellen giggles] Yeah. I have the next song. Uh, you should keep it. I'm done with that stuff. Uh, yeah. [inhales] Nicky said you'd say that, but, um, you should listen to it. Thanks, but... Bev. You can't give up. W-what if they're trying to tell you something? What if there's something magical? There isn't, Ellen. They're just... dead.
