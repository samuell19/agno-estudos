McDonald's app? Ew, I look like ka-ka. I can't even see right now. I mean, and my fucking eyes are on fire. Get ready to close your eyes and open them in a second. Okay. Oh, no. I look like a whole crackhead. What's the distance this hoe got? Think I can hit this shit from the tree? Bet. This is how we Texas boys get it. - Damn. - Whew! Okay! They don't want none of that shit. Damn! Bro, he straight, Vap, vap, vap, vap! I want to see Brittney shoot this hoe, bro. - Bro, Brittney... - She fly all the way back She'd be like boom! Oh! Chill! Okay! It's too... Whoa, Autumn! Aww fuck! The day's so long. It's becoming summer. I hope we're not just walking around this whole bitch, and they're not... we've been going the wrong way the whole time. There is no normal. There is no normal in teenage years. We're all confused. I feel like what most girls suffer from is they feel like... they're not seen. Obviously, you're the only person that can see what's scarred in the inside. Unless you tell someone, but nobody really truly understands. But anyways, let's go. Come on. I need another one. Yeah, me too. Sometimes life gets fucked up Fucked up That's why we get fucked up Fucked up I can still feel your touch I still do those same drugs Sometimes life gets fucked up Fucked up That's why we get fucked up Fucked up I can still feel your touch I still do those same drugs That we used to do I was used to you I was used to you "What have you been through?" She asked me Every fuckin' kind of abuse If you love me too You would give me you Give me you Lock me in your room Don't tell me the truth Everything you said Everything you said Stays inside my head Stays inside my head All the shit you said All the blood I bled Sometimes life gets fucked up Fucked up That's why we get fucked up Fucked up I can still feel your touch I still do those same drugs This is our morning exercise. Yeah. At night we freakin' run. - This is a freakin' hot spot, - Oh freak! Oh, come here! I don't know how better this can get. I party every day, and get drunk, and gives you something to do. Goddamn, that bitch got an extra staring problem. - She really... - She's gonna piss me off. Yeah. I think if I just hung out with anyone for like five hours, like a random person I didn't know, they'd want to be my best friend. That's what I think. I think I'm a pretty awesome person to hang out with, but. Okay, we're gonna tell my mom we're not drinking, we're not drinking. We're just going... Okay, we're just going to... Eat? With no drinking involved. Does that sound good? I never really hung out with people my age. I always hang out with older people. Hey. What's up? - How're you doing? - How you doing? Pretty good. But I feel like I'm mature enough to be an adult. Fuck! Hello? No, I'm not there yet. I'm still at the house. I need to take a shower and get ready. Alright. Where are you at? Shut the fuck up, and get out of my room, you little bitch. Get out. Me? I'm not scared of shit. Quit chewing with your mouth open. Ah! A lot of guys think, oh, she's new. I can get up in there real quick. I don't want people to think I'm easy to run over. It's okay. Ow! - Ow, fuck. - Yeah. Are you done? Uh, personally, I fucking hate teenagers. Yes, I'm saying I hate myself. I do things a little bit different than most people do. Most girls just grab a beer and blend in, I'm very wise, and my head's not up my ass. And because of the things that I've been through, I think before I do things. I just about never get drunk when I'm going out to a party, because I'm scared something's gonna happen. Like, someone's gonna do something. Boys, they listen to their dick, not their head. But not Dustin. I can trust him. Whoa, oh God, there's trees! Oh my God! Hang on! Oh Hell no! Just hang on. I'm sorry what? Did you say - you want to go harder? - Dustin please! My ass is ruined now. Autumn! Give this to Dustin. She said, "Huh!" Make a wish and blow it. No, I gotta hold it. Hold up, In the truck? I have to video it. Roll down your window. Put it right there. My arm's not gonna go that way. Just blow it! Make your wish and blow! He's throwing up. I love you. You're an asshole. I love you. Come here. - No, kiss me. It's your fault. - No, no, no, no! You've got to kiss me now. Ew! Don't lick me. Ew, you're gross. You're gross! Dustin is just everything He's comfortable with me. Sometimes he'll cry in front of me. But that's not a bad thing, that's not a bad thing. When I was younger, my mom would legit, like, beat me up for crying. Because crying is weak. Ready, Aaloni? Why are you hitting it so close to my face? Okay, no. Go over there. If I break a toenail, I'll be mad. If I break a nail or a toenail, I'll be really mad. Alright Mom, you ready for this serve? - Oh! - Oh, shit okay! Oh yeah buddy! My mom, she's my best friend. Me and her are just alike. I need you to do me a favor. Get this right here. Oh my gosh, Mom. Yeah, get it. It's not ready to pop. Yeah, it feels good though. Ugh. Oh, god this tool hurts. Oh yeah. Just don't slide it, just push down. Ow! Hey, it's life, everybody gets zits, even when you're fucking 41. I don't. I have a great skin routine. Which you're fucking right on. We were just talking about it. Small p-p-Pena. They never say it, but I know I'm my moms favorite. There's a lot of stuff that I have done, that she has not told my dad. Pump the brakes. Yep. All we did was kiss, and that's... Tell me the truth, is he a good kisser? He's a good kisser, he's a great kisser. - I thought... I thought you didn't like tongue He, okay, he didn't... Shh. I didn't make out with him, we did not make out because you know I don't like making out. She's as big as Dalyncia. Yeah, I could beat her up myself. Yesterday, I wish I did fight her. I wish I did. But I didn't want to get... Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, back it up. Pump the brakes. What happened with your sister? Show me what happened. Come on. Okay, how, okay, I'm you. Talk shit. She didn't say anything, that's the thing. And what did, and what did you say? I said you can step back. And she didn't. She walked up and I said, I backed up, and walked away. - I woulda been like... - Oh hold up, let me tell you how this happens. No. I would have been like... I told you to back up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's just me personally. No, no, no cuz there was a teacher... Come here. Come here. Don't hurt me please. I would have said, "I'm gonna give you two seconds to get the fuck out of my face." - Okay. - Okay, that's tough. And then she was like, she's gonna probably be like, - oh, but I didn't. And then... And then that's when you go like this. Get the fuck out of my face. And then she puts her arms around your arms. You got your lefty because you're a lefty. You're a lefty, right? You're a lefty. No! I had to be my left hand, because - I punch with my right hand. - Okay, so you go like this? Don't punch her in the face. It tickles. You gotta punch at her fucking crotch. Oh, no, no, no. No. You gotta punch her in the fucking crotch." 'cuz you can't leave no marks. I swear to gosh. I don't give warnings. My warning is if you're gonna keep talking shit, you can talk your shit, but once you step in my face, that's it. God, you're so much like me. Can you get me pizza now, please? You know how to test if your hair's healthy? You take a strand of your hair, and you wrap your fingers around it, and you just go like this. And if it doesn't break, it just, like, bounces, you hair is healthy. Blend that side in more. Oh, my brother's mowing the lawn that means we're getting the pool up! You know where I'm gonna be this weekend? With a cold beer and a blunt. Michael! Michael! You have to pick some stuff up before you mow. Bye, I love you. Y'all be careful. Did you get your pizza rolls? Oh. It's so hot... That shirt is so cute. Bro, you know, um, Brian and Nikki broke up? Why? He basically raped her. Are you serious? Yeah. She said no. And she was like trying to scream, and he covered her mouth so she couldn't scream, and then she said you have 10 seconds to get off me, until we're done. He wouldn't get off of her. When did this happen? Like last, the weekend before this week. She was like, should I forgive him? That's what I said, I'd slid up and I was like you shouldn't forgive him, like what he did, that's not okay. And she was like, "He really said he was going to change", and I was like "Well, his actions - Every dude does that. - Need to back up to his words." Yeah I... I know! I'd be like, we're not having sex for the next five fucking months, and then we'll talk about being back together. That's funny, because whenever he came over to our house that one time, and spent the night, he tried doing shit with me. Yeah, I know. I heard about it. I think you told me, or someone I... Yeah, he was trying to do shit with me. But then when I told him my age, he was like, and then he was like, "Oh, wait, age doesn't matter, it's just a number." Dang, he really out here raping kids. Okay, so you're going to that party Friday? Ah, no! Oh my God! Noah, get back here real quick. Push that hoe. Hm? You should push that hoe with me. Hold on, I gotta put these mother fuckers down. That should be good right there. Technically, 17 is an adult in Texas. Wait, you're 16, right now? - Yeah. - I'm three years older. I'm 19. Oh yeah, I fucking forgot. Fuck you. Can you come inside with me, for a second? I'm scared to go by myself. Y'all look at me, I'm about to smash two thotties. Shut up! I hate you. A what? Double flip. There ain't no Goddamn way. Well that didn't work out... Yo, I was walking out of Walmart earlier, and I swear to God, I saw the biggest booty bitch in the world, bro. - I swear! - I saw the biggest booty bitch - Bro! Bro! - Or the bitch with the biggest- Bro, I seent it, bro, with my eyes. I swear. And then I just turned around I was like, "Damn!" And then she turned around, I was like, "What's up little mama? Ey, ey! duh duh duh!" I was like, "Hold on! Hold on!" Who else wants a line? - Here! - I'll take a line. I do! Does that really bother you? Yeah. That one takes a while. Hey, Brittney, Brittney, Brittney, Brittney. Brittney, how old are you? 15. Bro, hit it! Yep. Nope. What the fuck? Oh shit. - What up, girl? - Oh she's drunk as fuck... - I almost fucking fell. Well, I have the video of... Fuck, I gotta get my phone, bro. - Okay, actually, I don't know where my phone's at right now. I'm gonna go grab my phone real quick Who has my lighters? Because I have a funny ass... I gave it to you. Didn't you come grab it? I'm gonna go get my phone, because I have a funny ass Are you listening? I'm listening. And then, okay, so we were on the way to Tony's and she is not fucking listening again. I'm listening. And then he took... Bro he was fucked up. My parents always hated me hanging out with older people. Because they always told me, like, "They don't wanna be your friend. They wanna fuck." I never wanted to lose my virginity. But it just happened. The whole time I was like, fuck, what am I doing? Okay, we're gonna say no. One, two, three. Mmm... I just couldn't say no. I don't really know why. I just was so scared to say no. Good morning America. I need to charge my phone. Dad! Do you have clothes that need to be washed, dad? The last few years, it's been just me and my dad. I grew up with a really fucked up mom, that fucked up all of us. Shut up. Y'all are annoying. We had this family friend, my mom would let him watch me. And she knew the things that he would do to me, but she didn't care. My dad knew nothing about it but my mom did, and she didn't care. Dad! You think I should, like, wash it with whites specifically? My mom is actually, um, the reason why I started therapy. You know, back then, I didn't think I was worth anything. I hope Dustin stays this weekend. I'm gonna be really upset if he doesn't. I told Dustin everything about me. He makes me feel whole. I missed you even though I saw you not even 24 hours ago. You're Tinkerbell, that's why. She has to have attention at least... once every hour. Are you coming over tomorrow? Uh... Depends, I think we might... I might run out to that trailer tomorrow. Where's my juul? I think it's under him. Him? Mother fucker. Him. Better not smell like your ass. Yeah, it better not. You ain't gonna wanna use it again. Can you pluck my eyebrows? Okay... Oh fuck, that one hurt bad. Are you almost done? Yeah on this side. I think plucking hurts worse than everything. Oh my fucking God, your hairs just don't wanna come out. Oh yeah mom let me ask you. Ask me what? So, you know how there's part two to the party tomorrow? Well, Damien said he'll take me, but I don't know if he will because he's... I don't know. But... Can I go? I have no problem with you going with your brother, it's your dad. Okay, um... Yes. Yes. Whew! Loving you is like a fairytale I just can't pick up the phone again This time I'll be on my own my friend One more time, I'm all alone again Sex with you is like I'm dreaming and I just want to hear you scream again Now you're gone, I can't believe it The time I spent with you deceived me I don't care if you believe in me I still wonder why you're leaving me I don't care... Hey Tone! If you believe in me I'm still wondering... Noel! No, bro If I'm taking this the wrong way I hope you know that you can tell me whatever You're thinking - it's when you put me in the spotlight - He's laughing. - He's not gonna stop us. Who's gunna stop us? And if I'm taking this the wrong way I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinking It's when you put me in the spotlight Fuck you, leave me alone, dude! When you put me in the spotlight When the moon hits your skin I can see you and him Not you and me But it's just you and me When the sun shines above Do a flip. Hey! Cut the music! Cut the music! Hey! Y'all have to be quiet. The cops are down the road Everybody shut up. Can they even come down here? Yes we should go, come on They can't come... We need to leave... - No no no no no. - Leave now! Party's over! Party's over, leave now. Where the fuck did Aaloni go? After party! Party's over! Gotta get rolling. Let's go! - Yeah. - Yeah, we should... I am so tired. You just said you're so energetic. I am but like I'm tired. Like I just I don't know. I don't know right now actually. I bet. Ooh-ee. Girls just don't know how to say no. They feel like they're forced into it I guess you can say. They're scared to say no. Why? Guys are powerful. Never happened to me. That I can remember. That's really bad. You can always tell somebody no. But they're still gonna do it. Like guys have more strength than us. I tried to get up and I was like, babe, no no no and he was like get yo ass back down here. He kind of gave me no choice. I mean no means go right? It's a "no face no case" Oh I can't do it because you're a minor. - But when were alone it's shh. - That's what they all say. Come in, come in, come in! Turn around! Go, throw it in! Go, go! Alright! Way to turn it on 'em. Way to turn! Boo! You want to boo me again? I'm gonna boo you in your face and see what happens. Dalyncia, stop, she's going to kill you. Do your finger thing. Pass the ball! No, not that! Come on Yaccob! You do what to do, Yaccob. Good job, buddy. He's so cute! Dad. What's the score? Two to one. - So they're winning? - We're losing. They're winning. Get that out of there. Why was that called so late? Good job, Yaccob! Where's the whistle on that? Where's the whistle in there? Come on, you've gotta be kidding me! Uh oh he's go... He flipped him off. Chill out man, they're just kids Uh oh. I don't know where he called the game, When our kid fall down, they don't call it! Chill. How about you go back over there? Yeah, you need to mind your own kid! Alright well... Why don't you fuck yourself? Uh oh. Hey how about you stop cussing in front of my kids? Why don't you? Why don't... You don't see us cussing. Do you see us cussing? - You're with your children. - Do you hear how he's talking? Stop, stop. It's okay. Don't spray the truck, I just washed it today. Huh? Ooh, I made it! I am eating, I don't want to hear y'all sing that. - Sorry. - Sorry. You, I told you a long time ago get your ass in the shower. It's already 8:30. Half my life, my dad was in the military, so he was never around. We have always just like, grown to him being gone. I just don't think he understands that. I'm not scared of him but he feels like this is his castle. He should be the king, and we're the peasants of the castle. Watch out Autumn, I'll fight someone over a beer. David's going to be like, why are you drinking a beer? - What? - You're fucking up my wall, man That was a lot! Oh. Oh he's such a fucking asshole. Dad. Dustin just ended it. Yep. Yeah! Hey. What are you doing tonight? Yeah. And I'm gonna get really fucked up because Dustin just fucking broke up with me. I literally feel like my heart just got ripped out of my chest. Aw, fuck. See, just put your hair in a ponytail. Don't leave it down. Like put it in a bun or something. I did put it in a pony tail. It just... Oh fucking Jesus Christ. Yeah. Okay while you're doing that, I'm going to jump to this side. Ow. Holy fuck! Caden's like any other teenage boy, but like he's more respectful, he's more loyal. That's like the only difference with boys. When he'd try and like hit on me, he'd be like, it sucks that you're... I was 15 at the time. So he'd be like it sucks that you're 15. And then just out of nowhere, I don't know what happened. I guess he just woke up one morning and just totally forgot about my age. - This one's a cute one. - Hi! You're so cute. Since I'm with Caden, I don't party every day, like I used to. I think he's pretty cute There's never been a place where's he's really needed to protect me. But I know if something were to happen to me, he'd kill a mother fucker. I already know. Caden's crazy. Aw fuck! You're gonna die either way. Just stop. Stop. Every time I get a text, my heart drops because I think it's Dustin. Or hope that it's Dustin. I honestly cannot tell you a day that I have gone without drinking or smoking since me and Dustin have broken up. Which is not a good thing, but I mean I don't know, like, I don't know what else I'm supposed to do because my way of coping was me cutting. It's scary being alone, and it's scary thinking too. Fuck I'm fucked. Dang, my bed used to be so low. Shh! Okay. I'm really proud that you have a really good attitude about it, Michele, you really do, because at one time you were like I'm not going to work. But now you like the taste of your own money. Yes I do. Because I haven't had a job since I've been married. Having this little job again, makes me independent a little bit, but I'm loving my husband again. Yes, like... So that's what he calls you? Yes, like, he'll call me his sugar momma. Hey, can you get me some cigarettes, hey we need this, this, and this and I'm like okay. Okay. Okay. It felt... it did feel good. It did? See but that's the thing I don't like him getting moody, but I don't fight with him. His PTSD. I don't like to see him hurt and crying because he has no one to open up to and he can only open up to another battle buddy. You stuck it out regardless of the whole situation Somehow, someway, you figured things out. Yeah. But I know he just needs, he needs to go take a shower and just cry like a woman. Just let it out. I do love the fucking asshole, because I'm not going to trade a new asshole for an old, you know, If I'm gonna have an asshole I might as well keep the one I have. Yeah, the grass is not always greener on the- You're right. The grass is not always greener on the other side. My mom has been through so much with my dad, and, like, she forgives him. I don't know. Maybe I have to get over it. I have no clothes here, it's horrible. All my clothes are at, like, Autumn's house and Caden's house. Brittney! Coming! I don't know, but I know this one's mine! Oh my fucking God. I'm ready to leave already. My parent's need to go to counseling or something. I swear to God, we have problems. My Dad said, "You haven't been home in forever. You better get your ass home and no one be with you." Just tell you parents what I tell my parents, "It's summer, Mom." They'll just say, "I don't give a fuck." Like they just fucking said. I have to spend family time, but they're gonna be getting fucking drunk as fuck. And I'm gonna sit in my room Why don't you just wait to leave The whole fucking time. Why don't you just wait to go home until they're already drunk? Because they're gonna change their mind when they're drunk. Because my Dad told me to get my ass home. I hate how my parents, like, they fuck up and do stuff, and it's like, fuck, you did something wrong and then it's like, brushes over. But as soon as, like, I do one little fucking thing, the fucking world's finna end. I'm not even fucking joking, like, Oh my God, it pisses me off. Like, yeah. I made a friend that doesn't make good choices, I'm fucking sorry, dude. Like, but let's not like, let's not bring up the fact that you have friends that molested me, like, that's okay though. Like, oh my fucking God. That shit pisses me off. "Make better friends." You were friends with someone for fucking 20 years and he molested me, shut the hell up and don't talk to me about my fucking friends. Can I see that? I want a time change 'til I'm 18- and leave here, and never see my parents again. I swear to God, that's what I'm doing when I'm 18. I'm never, ever, ever, ever, coming back here. It literally happened like five years ago. That was my Dad's best friend. My Dad knew him since he was sixteen. He trusted him. Shows you can't trust everyone. 'Cuz I've known him since I was born. I didn't have nights where I cried about it or anything. I just went to court for it, and... The only time I cried was when like I lost the case, and that was it. I feel like it's so far behind me, it doesn't really affect me no more. No? Oof. Uh, it's hot! My elbow's gonna slip. - Then fix it. - Hm. Ow, shit! I would have smacked my hand right here. You better? Ah-ha... I just can't find anything to wear. I thought you said Friday? Honestly, what's the point of even having flavored condoms if you don't suck dick with a condom on? When you take it off? People are different and weird. Yeah. Oh! My Mom, she was like, "I just want to ask, do you want, do you need to go on birth control or what?" I go, "Honestly Mom, I think I should because me and him have been getting closer and I'm not a virgin anymore." And I was like, "And it was in his car." She was like, "In the fucking car, Aaloni! You lost your fucking virginity in the fucking car?" She's like, "That shit's supposed to be more special. What the fuck?" And I just laughed about it, but, yeah. Honestly, if I could take back my virginity, I would. For one, I didn't want to lose it, but he kind of, like, forced that upon me and two, I was not ready. I told him, "No," literally four fucking times, four times. And I even pushed him off of me twice, and he still did it. That's how I lost my virginity. Technically that's not your virginity. He was like, Then why didn't you do something about it?" I was like, "Me saying no four times and pushing you off of me, what the fuck... What is that, what is that telling you? You think I want it if I'm pushing you off and telling you no?" Oh, okay. Do I need to cry? Do I need to punch you? What the fuck? I put all of the blame on myself. That's the first thing I did. At that point, I loved him. I guess you could say I was high on love, and then I was completely oblivious to what was happening in reality. I was ignoring what was actually happening. Alright Brittney. We gotta shoot before it gets dark. There's kinda bullets all over the ground. So how do I aim on it? Really there's no fucking aiming with this thing because its not accurate, you're supposed to aim, all right, this, just like that rifle when you shot at the river, you're supposed to put this in between these two. Put your finger on the trigger when you're ready to shoot. Push down. I'm scared. You have to squeeze the trigger pretty hard. Just don't pull back when you squeeze the trigger. - Ow! - There you go! Okay take it, that is fucking hard. Ow, that hurt my finger. That's all I had in that one. Ow! What? That fucking hurt my finger. What did you do? Did you have it up here? Yeah. This thing will come back and hit your finger if you don't... Yeah I did, I know now. Okay. You want... That fucking hurt. Like right here. I don't know, I've never really told a guy I loved him, so, I don't know. Neither one of us have said it in person, I don't think. I think I have one time, slipped it and she just like totally fucking ignored it, but... Yeah. - I, you never said that to me. - She just waited until we're as soon as I drop her off I get an I love you text, but that's it. Ow, your freaking hat poked me in the eye! It wasn't just, like, a day, like, it's just over time, like, we basically already live with each other, so... I feel like she'll probably live at her house until she's, like, 18. But she hates that, so, I say she's moving in. - Stop! - It's like Cinderella. - I got you. - Let me go. - Stop! - Here. We're kind of just at his house the whole time, unless his friends want to hang out. I just be the nice girlfriend. It's actually worked pretty well. I feel like I have not really done anything to make him mad. I mean, he's not like, "No, you can't hang out with your friends." It's more like, sometimes if it's a friend he doesn't really like me with, then he'll be like, "Do what you want." And I'm like, "That's a no, like, that's, you don't do that." Okay, Caden's rushing me. He's what? He's rushing me. I feel like you're about to get yelled at. Brittney. Is this one better? Mhm. Oh, that hurt the fuck out of my heart. We're about to go on a walk. Oh, where? - Just a walk. - Okay. Ooh! I coughed and more smoke came out. Are you good? This the weed that me and Dustin smoked when he was tripping off. Oh fuck, I need to text Caden. Take this. He said, "What's taking you so long?" Like he can't fucking track me. I mean, I don't know how to take that. He said, "I don't want to rush you, but I have work in the morning." Stay here then and go back tomorrow. I'm scared. I feel like he's gonna get mad. Just say, I haven't hung out with Autumn in a minute which you haven't, and I'm just gonna stay here tonight if that's... Or, or ask him. How? Is it okay if I stay at Autumn's? Even though he doesn't control you like that, but you're still... I know, like, he's still gonna let me, but he's still gonna be pissed. Let you? What you mean let you? Like, he's not gonna tell me no, I can't stay at Autumn's, but he's still gonna be mad that I left him. He just knows that... I'm gonna feel bad about it. It's your call. I did, I did a cartwheel and you're gonna mess it up. So, let's just see what kind of ice cream cake they have. Oh, that looks good. Okay, so what do you want me to write on there? Happy Birthday Dalyncia or Happy B-Day Dalyncia? That looks good. Ow. That hurts. You're 13 years old! Mhm. You came out Mama's punani. You just need to keep your nose in the books and do what you gotta do, because you want to make a lot of money, right? - Maybe. - Because you want to take care of your Daddy and I, right? - Yeah. - Well, mostly you, but... Okay. Don't be mean like that, that's still your father. I don't want you to be depending on a man. As your Mother, I depend on your Dad. Because Mommy was a fuck up. I was a fuck up. What does that mean? I forgot. Can you just shut your mouth, please? I'm trying to learn! Stop! Aaloni! What? Fuck. I'm just gonna go change, because Dad... I'm just gonna go change because Dad said, - he said... - Hurry up! He said, "You're not my daughter not with that on." Whatever. I can wear whatever I want, I'm at home. - Don't change. - Okay. Because he's a fucking dickhead, that's why. I just try to let it roll off my back. Yeah. It's okay though. He just made me so mad, it just ruined my day, but it's okay. It's okay. No, don't say nothing. Don't say nothing. Don't say nothing. Don't say nothing. Aaloni! Dad, You really hurt Dalyncia's feelings, because she was really feeling herself and then... I don't like when you guys run around with your belly button hanging o, I'm sorry. It is what it is. I don't like that shit. Okay, it's her birthday. Let her feel, like, comfortable with herself, Don't tell me how to act around my daughter. Well, sometimes you make us feel like crap and I don't like that and I don't like the way, how she feels right now, because that's my little sister - and you making her feel bad. - You're both my daughters. Don't fucking talk to me that way. You act like she's going ou... Stop fucking talking to me like that! Okay. Yeah, okay, exactly. You wonder why we don't like you and we wish... I don't give a shit if you don't like me. Weren't our Dad! We don't love you! What's the fucking difference? Stop! Stop! So, keep talking like that! Aaloni! You shouldn't have said anything! I told you. No, I don't even care, Dad's a fucking piece of shit! And he stays making us feel this way, Dalyncia! It's your birthday. You... it's not like you're going out and doing, like, showing people off. - No, you're staying home. - But I told you! I told you, but he probably wasn't. - I don't care! You're still my little sister. And that's a piece of shit - Listen, listen! Dad and he's never - Stop! Going to be there when we're going through our worst. Anyways. Oh, my gosh. Can't we just like.. Anyways. Have you ever tried Keystone before? You want to try it? - No. You're a pussy. Alright. He just doesn't drink beer. Kings... So, whoever got the first... Oh, is that that card game where you drink? - Yeah. - Oh! Happy birthday, dear Happy Birthday to you! Guys, I'm growing cleavage. No, you're not. I've barely got cleavage. I'm growing tissue like right here. Oh, tissue. Okay - Yeah. - That's different. I got Snapchat. Okay, so- Oh fuck me sideways. He wants me to send him booty pics for mon. Would you do it? - For money? Yeah. - Yeah. For McDonald's, yeah. Uh, I'm gonna say, "I'll watch you jerk off for 50 bucks." I would never watch a dude jerk off. That's so gross. Just answer it. Just answer it. Autumn! Someone say something. Oh my God, that's disgusting. Why was it so curved like a U-turn? Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna throw up. It was as bent as the McDonald's sign. No, stop, stop, stop. Can I have some of your fries? Yeah. My fries in the moment. - I don't regret this. Mm, mm, mm, oh. I'm not ready to go back to school. If there was a reset button on painting, I would definitely press it right now. Boy. Dad, I hate this painting. - What happened? - I don't like this painting. Autumn, it looks beautiful. It's too dark. No, it's not. This is dark. I wanted it to be lighter. Okay, so, change up your mixture and paint it again if you're that unhappy with it, but honestly... I don't think I can do that Okay. Because it's dry. Okay, but you can paint over paint. You know? Okay, but you can't put bright paint over dark paint. Yes you can. It's beautiful, girl. All you gotta do is fix your boo boos and take a damn bath, wow. Yeah. My mom... She always bugs me about being home more, but I don't really care. I come here for, like, a day, and then I leave for about, like, three or four, and then I come back. I leave for about three or four. Come back for a day. I don't understand why I have to be home. Like, I understand they wanna see me, and they don't wanna have to worry about me being out, but there's nothing for me to do here. I, like, literally hate being home all day alone. It scares me. I hate being alone. Me and Caden... I think we're fixing to get an apartment maybe. Oh, you're moving out. Well, it ain't happening. You're not eighteen. Okay, you didn't have to come in here all nyeh nyeh. I asked you, and I left you alone about it, so... Well, it ain't happening. - Okay! I didn't - So six months from now, - ask again, did I? - You can ask me again. - No! - Cuz it's not happening. - Did I ask again? No. - And if you try, I'll call in the fucking cops. - On what? - That'll answer your question. - On what? - On you! - For what? - And Caden, and whoever the fuck else I have to. You move out, that's what's happening. You know, if you call the cops on me and Caden, he'd go to freaking jail! Yeah, so don't move out, and you're fine. Okay, then, if you wanna be like that, when I turn eighteen, you won't hear from me again. I'm serious! She kicks me out all the fucking time, but when I wanna live with my boyfriend, it's a fucking problem? That makes no fucking sense. That shit pisses me off because my mom was sixteen, and my dad was nineteen when they met each other, so that's just not fucking fair for her to say that. What are they having for dinner tonight? Where are your parents at? It's late. Hello? Yeah, he said some shit on fucking Cory's thing Huh. I just don't do anything like I used to do. Hi, Mom. So you never replied to me, and even my text messages didn't get back. Yeah, I was... I just texted you what I was doing. Okay, well call soon. Okay. Caden went to go mow grass. I'm just at his house. We're coming! Alright. I'm a free fucking woman. Fuck! Why the fuck would you give it to me? Uh-uh, Autumn's gonna burst. Um... Fuck, guys, I'm doing this. Like, I'm so scared I'm sobering up. Please don't scream, that's one. Two, do not move. And three, nipple skin is really thick, so I can't just go: one. It's gonna be, like, one two. So, we gotta make the nipple hard. Okay. Okay, this part, the clamps, low key kinda hurt. Not gonna lie to you. Oh, I can't watch. I'm scared. Oh, bitch! Okay, I'm gonna need you to hold this so I can get the needle. I can't hold it. I can't hold it. I can't hold it. I can't hold it. Is there a way to... Don't let that shit swing! No, no that's not right! Okay. Okay. Are you ready? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh fuck, this fucking hurts. Don't make me laugh or shake. Okay? One... Oh, I'm so scared. Two... This is the most... I'm so scared. In my whole life. I don't want her to scream or anything. Please don't scream. Do you wanna bite on something? Do you know what you're doing? I do know what I'm doing. I just can't see. Ready? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. - Don't-don't do that - Sorry. Because you're making me shaky. Okay, one, two, three. Okay, now it got stuck. It went through, I just have to go all the way through now. It's not going through. What is wrong with your nipple? Fuck. Wait, what? I see, it's poking right out. Yeah, it's right there. Do you have any idea how, like, painful that looks? You have to push it through harder. Okay, jut fucking push it. I'm trying but it's Okay, it went through. There was so much blood. It's okay. Alright, well, let Aaloni wash her hands. Oh yeah. You're putting beer on it? You feel any different though? I feel like I just made a mistake. But it's fine. I make many of those. It's cute. I haven't rode a bike in forever. Your feet are tiny! - Who, mine? - Yes! Aaloni, could you do a whee? Maybe you should go that high actually. Yaccob! Now please! I wish a lot of things were different. A lot of things. But if it was different, I wouldn't have my four children. I don't know if I'm doing a good job. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. I hope. I don't want them to hate m. A lot gets held inside without it being shown. But when you're by yourself, it comes out. I just... You can't be weak. Well, you can... You can. You can be weak, but you can't be that weak because everybody just human. Mom, can I wash, like, white color jeans? They're not white, but they're basically white. Of course you can those aren't white. So what am I gonna wear? All right. So, I got a really cute outfit for you. First day of school. Aaloni, you know what's cool though? I had a little growth spurt this summer. This is it right here. This is what I'm wearing to school, guys. Looks the comfiest. I need a hair tie. It's up there. This is my hair tie. I was looking for this. Bye! Love you. See ya! Smile, don't say anything rude. Life is good. Love you. Have a good day! Love you too, mom. Love you too, mama. Go back! No! Most people are afraid to be themselves. I think if you were to know that you were strong, you'd have... or people in general would have a lot more confidence in themselves and confidence, confidence can take you a long way. I feel scared of what might happen next. Like, I know myself more, but, like, I'm only 16. I have forever to go. All I want... All I want is-I want you to pick a... I want you to hit it at least ten times. I mean, some of us were raised tough. So like, keep it in. Don't cry. Get knocked down. Get back up. Don't do anything fancy. Time! Trying to hold it in doesn't really help me because I'm still mad. So that might make it a little easier. Keep your feet mobile. Don't lean into it so much. It'll pull you right back down. But now I'm learning I can be happy. I can be sad. I can be mad. I can be anything on my own. Alright. Two more times each. Two more times each. Go! Hey! Fuck, Aaloni, please catch me! I will! Okay, last one. These are better than sex. But the sex I had was pretty trash. Yeah, I was gonna say... I don't know if I can ask you that question, but I kind of want to ask. Have you ever had sex? Many times. Okay. How does it work? Okay...
