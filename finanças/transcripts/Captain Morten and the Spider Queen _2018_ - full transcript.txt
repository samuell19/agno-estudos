Dear dad, when you get home, will you be able to bring me back .... Dear dad, I'm building myself a small sailing boat. I even found a anchored to his size. Come back soon, little pigeon. Dead in ! Come down, you have a repetition in costume. Remember, we have to dance for dad and mom. I do not want to dance, Elisabeth. I remind you that these are your parents, not mine. What is this way of writing! Correct me that all of next, if not, I'll shoot you. But we are not lettrists. It's not our thing, the spelling. We are sailors. The only ocean you know is in this bottle and you are drifting. Hey, that's not true, we even tattoos to prove it. It is rather a shipwreck. In addition, we must stuff the chores for a bowl of soup and some donuts. I tell you, it's the galley. Oh, Morten! Oh ! Dead in ! Hey ! Yeah! - Ouch! - I make you bother my fish! - I'm just floating my boat. We do not answer, insolent little! Ouch, but, a captain does not give up never his boat. You are not captain. Besides, you do not have a boat. That's wrong, I have a boat and I am the captain The one-eyed is one of the personalities the most mysterious of piracy. The archives report that he was abandoned on an island following a mutiny of his crew. He would have lost the reason more to the disappearance of his treasure. Years later, crazy crises made him take his mansion for a boat. Ah, a storm approaching! Slip the sail, hoist the big bulwark! Hold on tight ! Carter Lorient, driving me to my treasure! Yeah, dad! Here is your spaghetti! Dead in ! - Ho ho! - Yeah! - Dad ! - Dead in ! Good navigation, captain! Oh, on the seas, it's happening strange things. Have I already told you whale dancers! They make ballets on the ocean singing. - Where is Morten? - In his room. It's not true, what amateurism! - What is he doing ? - You punished him. Do not answer me, in place! First position! How do you want that I find my inspiration when you're commenting behind me ? Hi everyone ! My dear Captain Vicks, what a good surprise ! - Please sit down ! - Thank you ! How are you ... always so well done with this adorable wick? So, Captain! I imagine that your travels were the theater incredible adventures! Incredible, indeed. While I was sailing in the South Pacific, I was invited to take the tea by native people. But, I only had me to maintain, splices to repair on the ropes and I did not have time to simmer to become tender like a lamb. So I was forced to decline their invitation. And by chance, I met an old friend who took me back to the boat. Well, you deserved your reward. I understood, then, that he was time I spend with you. It's exciting, captain! Unbelievable ! Oh, the best basket in the world! It's divine! Light as a butterfly, Elisabeth, do not forget! It's time to weigh anchor. - Already! - The tide does not wait. Dead in ! My captain, we have to sail! Your mother misses you! She should never have come sail with me. It was so cold in this damn North Pole. We did not think we'd ever return to the boat. And, that's where your mother decided to become a penguin. We can not blame him. I could have easily to become a penguin. Go! You know it's wrong! - I have to go. - I want to come ! Nice, one day, I'll take you. In the meantime, you need a anchor better weighted. Hang in there ! Hum! No worries, it's a pleasure to take care of Morten. We love it like our own child. I do not have much for you. Hold ! I doubt he will pay us one day, my dear! No worries, Felix, I know how to get reimbursed. I will find the gold of my ancestor Le Borgne, even though I have to dismount her boat to his last nail. Hop! HM hm ! Dead in ! Wow, it's beautiful! Be a good boy and go tell your mother that Mr Stinger is here. Anna is not my mother! Go tell him and do not come more bother me when I visit the queen of butterflies.

From now on, I would devote myself to choreography This ballet is entitled butterfly and the flower. Hey, you, I recruit a crew. Morten, concentrate! Give him his dog as he was. - Oh ! - He does not appreciate being very small. Give him his dog as he was.

Let's see that! Ah! Una a ... r ... Oh ! Bravo! You liked it ! Beautiful setting! It's amazing! Imagine what I could do with a real theater, with dancers professionals but I would need a patron. Captain Vicks you owes money, demand that he pay you The captain is completely broke. I'm afraid he can not never pay me back. You could require that he sells his boat. The Salamander is not worth a nail, a tub also badly in point. I'm not so sure, I know, maybe an amateur who would pique to buy it. You should autograph your book with my solid gold pen - Before leaving ! - With great pleasure. Write all the good you think of my little show. - Hum! - Oh ! Oh ! Hold the bar!

Do not be angry, let's go. - Do not we repair? - No ! Okay, it's you the master on board. Looks like a real boat with all his passengers. If I could navigate on it with real sailors, I would be .... ah! All this is your fault! I feed you, I educate you, I teach you art, but you, you are only an ingrate. With your father, go do the sleeve in the street when I'm done with you. Ah! Dad, where are you? Oh no ! Ouch, ouch! Ah! Stop ! I tell you to stop! It's not the moment, stop! It's not possible ! No !

Would you please to stop making noise, the queen is resting. - It's him ! - What are you drooling! Ah! My god, who is this little boy that you have dropped? It's for his good, he must learn to swim.

Put it in the cool, it will be the next. Ah! A cargo of sugar! - Do not touch me ! - But who are you ? I am Elysa! What are you doing there ? I do not know why I was locked up! I ate quietly in the sun on a beautiful day of spring, I feasted when something very big raised me and threw me in that hole. I tried to escape while munching! But, I think I did a big mistake! I had to close the hole and I've been waiting since. I do not have to wait, and wait again! I wonder how many time I have to wait again! and, who could have done that to a small caterpillar who must feed! Whoever did that did not want not hurt you, he may not have understood what he was doing. Come on, do not cry anymore, we will leave.

He can not take anything anymore, now. Eh, and why are you coming trouble my cruise? It is to propose you a market ! You pique my curiosity! What is it about ? We could win both a fortune! I'm starting to succumb to your charm, captain! My charm is nothing next of this treasure that awaits us! Do you like tango, captain? I was waiting for you take the first step. ♪ So what do you think of my proposal? I am thinking about it! What you need before it's all about a captain. I know it only too well. A sailor who falls asleep during his shift does not work. You would not do that, is not it ! Ah, I have my little tricks not to fall asleep! I tell him stories, stories of sailors with water monsters disorders, giant octopus, whales and seductive sirens ... This is not the moment ! I would like a gesture from you to create a climate of trust. But, your desires are orders! Quenome, your hero sacrificed honors you! Courage! My captain ! Right away ! That tickles ! This is where the treasure is! But, there is only water! No, your majesty is tea! A spoonful per person and one for the teapot! So much for you, captain!

The right way ? My dear Annabelle! Before you leave, would you agree a last dance? No, you see, my dear! I have to tell you that you dance on the wrong side. But I take this for a compliment, coming from you! I do not understand ! Why did you ruin everything in trying to steal my boat? I took command then that everyone was sleeping, to protect you, what a misunderstanding! Yes, I had founded a lot of hope on this young man, thinking that he can appoint captain. And you have been invited on board our boat. Know that I hate setbacks, especially to tango. One two Three ! What a good teacher you are! I made progress, would I right to another lesson? I have a cramp, at help, Peter! Ah, for once, you call me by my name!

Mutiny and misconduct serious to your duty as a sailor! Endangering the crew, Zack, shoots, Uh! From abandonment of post to vigil! To these charges are added aggravating circumstances vandalism on our royal flag, symbol of our heritage cultural, Zack, shoots, as a result of the powers conferred upon us We condemn you, Morten Vicks, to be transformed in a most delicious dish donuts of our kingdom.

Thank you for coming to my rescue, but, I can not abandon the boat. How, do you want to go back? I have no choice, the boat could sink! But no, I plugged the hole. Bravo, Elysa, with what did you block it? I took pieces of the cargo. Ah, sugar! You have to go back, the water will do melt the sugar cap. But, it's dangerous, ah! Two of a sudden! - Hey ! - Help ! Get out of this net! But, it moves too much! What is this place? This is not a frequent place, for a butterfly. Ah! Oh, it's my father's boat! So, let's see that! Hum! But, you are a very beautiful specimen! Help, Morten! - Let me go ! - You will not feel anything. Oh ! - Attention, it stings! - Ouch! Quick ! It annoys me ! Where are you hiding ? I'll find you ! But, I hate this game! Where are you, huh? - Wow ! - Oh ! - Come in, Madam? - Thank you. It seems that your interior lack of a feminine touch! You are right, my dear, excuse the disorder. I was working on my collection when you arrived. I did not know you also collect the boats? This one is particular, it's a legacy! It's a model Salamander! She once belonged to my ancestor, Le Borgne! Ah, I understand why you want to buy this old ..... I mean, this beautiful boat. It must have great value sentimental for you. It is also important for me that dance is for you. There are some parts precious wood. I will dismount it in pieces to sell. It must be prevented from doing that. And you, my dear, you will not have more to devote yourself to dancing. But, it's the most nasty of the world. You, too, are the most charming that I met .... Let's drink to our future success! They will destroy the boat of my father and put him out of work! What business sense do you have! You are my source of inspiration. So, Captain Morten, what are we doing ? My father owes them money. He will have to sell them the boat. Oh, no, we'll think and find an idea. A captain does not give up never his boat. You're right, I found what to do. Yes ! Are not you afraid to go back? Oh, yes, but, I have no choice! So, you are very brave. It's you who encourages me. Yes ! Oh ! Ah! I worry if the tide continues to go up, we'll all be sticking, on the ceiling, I do not like it. Do not say anything like that, Morten no longer there to help us Felix, show me that you are able to steer this boat! I do not feel very well ! Come on, decide! Machine that does not work. Lets' go ! Mr Jean-Paul What, what are you doing here? You're back ? This machine does not want still not work. I want to make this talk radish and it does not work. I came back precisely for your machine, show it to me! Uh! Something is written there! Be careful, keep out of the reach of grown-ups who do not know what they are doing. It seems that this is your case! So, the piston, the pressure gauge, I concentrate! To drink, I am thirsty, I want some water ! It worked. Extraordinary, we know when to water it, we send him a bucket. Just think hard. Give me that! No, I need it. How is it, it's mine. I have to fix the nonsense that you made with this device. It's mine ! I'm thirsty, water! But who is back among us? To me ! This is our donut dish! Do not count on me ! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! My crown! Ah ah ah! Now, nothing do not separate us! My little dancer, detach me! I hate moisture! It's a betrayal, I'm going turn into donuts! Felix! Ah! Crew, stow on the rail! - Officer! - Me ! Take me on the vigil! My dad, show them what you have in your stomach! Oh, my bidou, your desires are orders. Officer of the bridge, to your orders, my captain! And hop ! Wow! Oh, I'm hungry! A little donut, your queen is hungry! I order you to feed me! - Hang in there! - What do you mean ? Ah! Hum! You see, I told you that we would meet again! What, did you tell me that? I do not remember. I ... I understood that I had done wrong! I did not know that I hurt you. In fact, Morten, I have some something to tell you! I know, too, I feel The same thing as you ! - It's your father, he's here! - What? Hum! To me ! So, you can not pay the pension for Morten? But, you own a boat that is worth money! And I bet you have a buyer for the boat! Indeed, here, Captain, this I am ready to pay! Here is the part you owe to Anna! This is for occasional damage caused by your son! And that's what's yours! No, dad, stop! He wants the Salamander for recover his wood and cut it into pieces. She, too, is in the know! That's enough ! You are nailed to the ground! And you are still running after the gold of the pirates! Gold pirate! But, I thought it was a secret and be the only one to know his existence ? That's what you believe! Remember what I told you told about the pirate Le Borgne! My rear rear grandfather was there when they were abandoned by the mutineers of the Salamander. Oddly enough, Le Borgne metamorphosed into crab! Before disappearing under a rock, he said: All the gold is hidden in the Salamander wood! My great grandfather managed to leave this island. And there, he met my rear great grandmother, a beautiful and very rich woman. She helped him buy the Salamander to a Chinese merchant. They searched the boat from bow to stern. So what ! Nothing ! They did not find gold. That's a beautiful story. I do not believe a single word. It reminds me of something ! In my book on pirates, they say that Le Borgne is become completely crazy, so much so that he believed to be in his boat when he was in his house. That's the explanation, the gold must be in ... The wood of your house. Come, my dear! It was a very nice conversation, but, I must leave you. He has my fountain pen in Now, would you like me? Of course, my beauty, Queen of butterflies! We will sell your coffee and we bask in the sun! Anna, I would like you to say that I leave you! Everything is finished between us. Come on, my fuck! Well, I think it takes give this money back to this little pig at who he belongs. Yes, he needs to be fattened. He has a huge appetite for parts. He asks for more, that's it! Do not stop .... Ah, ah, ah! he wants more and more ... Ah, ah, ah! He'll need a treasure! What a hodgepodge! There is no treasure! But, dad, this is the Salamander, the treasure! You are right, Captain Morten! Wow! Get ready to sail! At your orders, Captain Morten! Hey, wait for me! I want to become a sailor! Hey, do we need a crew member ? It's you, the captain and the only one master aboard the Salamander. It seems that there is no longer world to take care of you! Um yes ! You can join us, we have always need experienced sailors, - is not it, captain! - How nice ! But, we do not have too much the marine foot. It's been a while since we're on Earth and Stinger is counting on us! And we can not do it false leap, sorry! My dear Anna, I would love to offer you a golden hand with a diamond set on each nail. You are adorable, my dear. Hey, you two, do not do not linger! Find this gold or I'll shoot you. - But where ? - We can not find anything. The gold fever made them completely lose your head. Rou, rou! Oh ! They made nails with gold! Dad, look! Nails are gold! This is where the famous treasure was hidden! And it is he who holds the boat in one piece. Here, what are we going do now ! Uh! Put him back where he was. That's my boy! Can we hoist the sails? With pleasure, Captain Morten! Yeah! Crew of the Salamander, ready for the maneuver! - Forward all! - Yeah!
