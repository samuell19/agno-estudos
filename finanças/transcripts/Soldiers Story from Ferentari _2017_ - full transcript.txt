- C'mon, man, he is feeling sick. - So what? I am feeling sicker. Is this one gram? Yes. Pass it to me. Draw up some water. Hurry up, it hurts bad! - Want a filter? - Yes. SOLDIERS A Story from Ferentari This is all you have? No furniture, no fanfare? Yes, this is all my dowry. Traffic was crazy. You're screwed without your girlfriend's money. 1500 euro a month! You should have kissed her feet! Bad luck. Let's go. Can you pick that up? It's not that bad. Careful with the junkies, they'll try to get in. Thanks, I owe you a beer. Pretty boys! Jesus is coming, If you're ready to go Look up and see Him, Mighty and pure as snow Jesus is coming... There's no washing machine. What's this? How about a proper lease contract? I've used this one for all my tenants. An ID? It has to be signed. Gotta obey the law. - You're 40. - Yes. What brings you to Bucharest? I'm doing my Ph.D., he translates books. Schooling is fine, just not too much. Me, at 16, I was already making money as a waiter. Money and women will ruin a man. - Any debtors on the utilities list? - None in this building. Let him play, he's gambling my money! - Want one in the face? - Stop arguing. Let him win my money back! He lent me money. Stay in your place! You gave me 25 lei, now you think you own me? - It's my money! - You'll get it back! I worked hard for it! - You'll get it back. - After you gamble it away here? - You play on these? - So what if I do? - With my money? - You lent it to me. You said I'd get it back when you win. All you've won is a beating! I can have it back in an hour. Or tomorrow morning. Want another 20 to stick in those machines? There you go. As if! Hey, no fighting. Give him the money! You say you gave me money? I did, and you stuck it all in that machine! That's enough. Turn it down. Four-eyes, how about you buy me a beer? Buy me a beer, to show you're not a limp-dick chicken. Alright. Great! Get moving. Let a man catch his breath. A beer. - Shut your mouth when I'm talking! - Fine! - Any luck with four-eyes? - Get rid of this one. To all my brothers! Let's stick together in tough times. In tough times and in the clap. Brothers? You don't look alike. Next time you stop by, say you're friends with Alberto Knuckles. The badass daddy of them all. Are you two related? - No, just friends. - But we're like brothers. I looked after him in prison. I was in there for 18-19 years. You're that old? "That old"? I'm over 40. I spent half my life there. No point hiding it. - He had my back. - If it wasn't for me... ...he'd be dead. Four-eyes, how's about that beer? I can't buy a round for everyone here. You buy me one out of fear. You know who I am. Not out of fear. Only if I want to. If you don't want to, I'll make you. - Gotta show respect. - Hey, he's a good guy. - You know him? - Yeah, he's from the neighbourhood. Really, you know him? I wouldn't want to punch him if I don't have to. - Don't punch him. - Alright. Then how do we settle this? You tell me. I'll finish this one and get you a beer too. OK. We're all tight in the 'hood here. How long would you go to prison for a million euro? Fuck the money. Not a single day. Have you ever seen a million euro? Say ten thousand. I'd give four years of my life. I did 14 years, four more wouldn't kill me. Then I'd be set for life. Nothing to do but scratch my ass all day. Four years of life, that's a lot. Life's short enough. Nah, I'm used to prison life. - Then why did you cut yourself? - 'Cause I liked it. I don't think so. Shut it. You're telling him too much. Look at that clock. It's old. It's not working, it's just for show. A Ph.D. in manele music? In Gypsy pop? - Did he pay you to bring him here? - No, I swear! He wants to know about the life of a manele singer. He doesn't look like he's doing a Ph.D. in manele. His face doesn't make me curious. It's not worth my attention. Here is an article I wrote. - An American book? - Yes. - There's my photo. - Huh? There, my photo. Really? - See, that's my picture. - This is you? - You had better style. - I didn't wear glasses. Why didn't you dress the same? I'd respect you more. - I came from the neighbourhood. - You don't look like much. - From Ferentari? - Yes, I do my fieldwork there. - Really? - That's where most manele listeners are. It's manele country, isn't it? - Yes, but manele are everywhere. - True. So how can I help you? With eyes full of tears, It hurts my heart to see A friend I trusted so Wanting to harm me. You're always on his side, Honest and true, And now he says harsh words, Ready to hit you. A good friend, a true brother Is getting hard to find, Now I stay away from them, I run away and hide. There is no real friendship, Brothers are cold as ice, They used to sell you for a loaf, Now they sell you for a slice. Stop. Ever been sold out by a friend? After you opened your heart to him? Rarely. That's what drew me to manele. Why this total distrust of friendship? So few manele say good things about friendship. I've tried to understand but I still don't. Why is it people in manele don't believe in friendship anymore? You know how many brothers he has? Five. Only five! Who fed you? God in His mercy. Life's good here with me, right? - And before? - It was hard. - Why? - Because we were poor. What did you do? Don't be ashamed, Adi is my friend. It doesn't matter who you were. Never forget where you came from, son. He wants to know about your life. I'll tell you more about him later. You tell it like it is. Well, he's a child... Now I've introduced you, he's acting like a true manele singer. Soon his nose will be high up. Just tell the freaking truth, what's the matter? Let him know your life story. I was poor and... - Then I came to you. - And before? I sang in the streets. How much did your mother spend on you? She didn't. Why so? She had no money. - Your parents don't have jobs? - They couldn't find any. Couldn't find any? Then why did they keep popping out babies and unloading you all on me? I'm joking, son. - They have no means, right? - Right. Not you father, not the rest of the family? No. Life was tough on you. Let this guy know. Tell the gadji. Tell him about a day of your life. Now I am happy, Luck has smiled on me, Time to wipe my tears, Now I'm all carefree. God saw me and helped me get better, So people would stop calling me 'beggar'. They laughed when I asked for a dime, I was alone and helpless all the time. God heard my prayers and He helped me since, And from a beggar he made me a prince. I know what it's like to beg and feel lost, But now I live like a prince in a castle. Though I got all I want, I can't forget the others, My mother and father and my dear brothers. Put on a song to brighten up the mood! It's like a funeral in here. Last night I played at the slot machines... Get away from there! Get the hell home, I want to close up! Not a care in the world. You come and go as you please. I can't even get drunk. - I thought you weren't married. - I'm not. I live at my cousin's. He has small children. His wife gives me hell for drinking. So get a job, move out. Rent is cheap here. Won't you give me a million euro? It's nothing to you. A million is a bit much. But I can spare a beer. How about a hooker? Forget the beer. - Fine, then 2-3 beers. - Or are you a homo? - Maybe you are. - You can tell me, bro. I screwed guys in the clap, I ain't ashamed. The dick don't know where you stick it. Nonsense! Nothing beats a cunt. I'd even drink water from a cunt! The ass is nice too, all warm. I can fuck you if you want. You too. Right here on the table, see if I don't. Son, want some fat cock? You sick little fucker. Don't scare people. Let's get a whore. Only 100 lei, quality stuff. See you, guys. See you. I fucked guys in prison, I'm not ashamed to say. You seem like a good guy, I like you. I don't care you're a man. I'm sick of your prison stories. Prison, sex, whores. How about a normal story? What got you all upset? My woman just left me and you keep yapping about whores. Then say so! Alberto can sort you out! How do you forget a hangover? With a beer. And a pussy? You stick it in another one! Let's go whoring! Thank you. Goodnight. Go in. Come on, we don't have all night. Keep your shoes on, it's messy. Just come in. Hi. How's it going? Hi. - Want some wine? - Hi, Vasi! - You remember him, right? - Sure. - A glass of wine? - I'm translating. - Two glasses, then. - No. I'll get sleepy if I drink. Pity. - Can I sit here? - Sit anywhere you want. What's with the look? - Isn't it pretty? - You're something, bro. It's filthy in here. No time for cleaning this week. Or last week. Let's clean up before she gets here. - 'This your sock? - Who else's? There, all tidied up. Pass me the phone so I can call the broad. How's it going, babe? That's great. Yeah. Me and a friend. Say, babe, how much for both? OK. Let me ask my friend too. Just talked to a broad, she's really hot stuff. For 150 we can pound that hard! 150? That's my food for a week. 60 or nothing. You crazy? Who would come for 60? She's a clean girl, no skank! We do it my way. No. It's my money, my way. Babe, can you hear me? I'll call you back in 5, OK? Sure I'll call, pussycat. Take care of your hole, alright? You taking me for an idiot? Why the fuck did we come here? To drink. Now what? We stare at each other? We drink. You don't know what you want, bro. You afraid of pussy? You think it bites? The girl is clean and she knows her way around. Keep it down. Play some porn on your laptop. - Know how to make cubes? - What? - You know how to make cubes? - Cubes? - How? - With your cigarette. Like rings? Square rings. Look. Now make them square. I don't know how. Keep trying. You have some tits. And here? Here as well. Kiss me. Just a kiss on the cheek? I want it on the mouth. You sure? A bit heavy, aren't you. Too heavy? No, it's pleasant. I don't mind. Find some porn with women. Is this one fine? Try this one. That's a good one. Really good. - It's too small, right? - It's fine. The balls under the foreskin help. Maybe that's why women never stick around. Because it's small. Who cares? It does the job. Did you sleep well? - Did you sleep well? - Great! Get in here. There. Up we go. Don't go back to sleep! I have to get to work. Where do you work, love? An NGO. The Ph.D. doesn't pay enough. Two jobs! You're doing well. It's only this month. Then I'm screwed. I told you to get the fuck up! Get dressed. - So, do I come over tonight? - I'll ask Vasi. As you wish, girlie. But our thing stays quiet as the grave. Got it? On the down low. Whatever you say, just get up. Let me finish my cigarette. How much do you want? Pass me 50. Let me find my wallet. It's behind the laptop. Hurry up, I really need to get to work! Good luck. Hi. How's it going? Want some coffee? If you're making it. Say, Adi. What were you thinking bringing him here? He's my lead in the field. So you bring him home? He spent 14 years in prison. It's my job. Who will show me around? It's your job to fuck? I didn't say that. - Are you seeing him again? - I have to. I don't want to see him again. - He's dangerous. - None of your business. What if one day he robs you with a knife, then comes after me? Oh, come on. Don't "come on" me! He's the real thing. Try to shake him off. While you still can. I hear you. - Any leftover soup? - Yes. Mr. Adi, an ice cream for the young lady? - Get her a cola. - OK. - She your girlfriend? - You like her? So soon after your ex? Can't hurt to try. What's she doing around here? She's writing about structural racism in Romania. - What? - She wants to meet poor Gypsies. Another one who cries over the Gypsies' misery! What a nice girl, making money off our poverty. How about she pays my bills? She just writes about the poverty here, hoping to get some donations. Nah, she's just using poor Romanians. She wants to buy you a beer. What am I, a beggar? No, I'll buy you one. Hi there. It's about the heart, not the money. - We're not too poor for a beer. - True. Don't be a jerk, buy me a beer and I'll pay you back tomorrow! - Hi. - Hello. Any word from Borcan? He called half an hour ago. He had just crossed the German border. - When will he get home? - About 1 a.m. He promised me a pair of shoes. No idea, ask him. You just had to leave tracks everywhere! Mop them off or I'll have your balls! - I won't work for you. - Move over. Get to work. Attention! A dedication from Borcan to his Liliana! Another one from Borcan to his bro! Thank you so much! As you can see, 100 euro! What were you thinking, coming to Borcan's table? I got drunk. You thought I'm a hobo for nursing one sad beer? No way, I'm a wise guy. - Do you like it? - It's great. My love nest for rent. 50 lei an hour. It's out of my league. How about the three of us get under the shower? There's room for a whole disco. Oh, she likes it. I got smart back in '94. I figured - why pick pockets myself? I put together a band of children, got them uniforms, and sent them to steal for me. They earned me more money than pimping. - I called them my soldiers. - Soldiers? Just like the Sicilians and the Africans. Only we start them young. You're crazy. Why so, bro? Nowadays you can do whatever you please, we're free. I was abroad too, I'm not afraid to tell you. I got smart there too. Why bother begging? I went with guys in parking lots. - Are you done? - In a bit. I can't hold it, I'm walking in on you. Nice cock you got there! Let's measure them up. - Get out of here. - Just joking, man! Ain't that pretty. I told you to stay home. Get in the car right now. When I worked at Mr. Sirbu's TV station, he was sitting with a beer, just like you, and he started to laugh at me. I tripped over some cables. But then he offered me a beer. Might I have a cigarette? Here. Get the fuck out, hobo! I'll bash your head in! - Out! - You're making me look ridiculous. You swore you'd stop handing cigarettes around. They're my cigarettes. Let's go to your place. I fought with Borcan, I don't want to go back. And I'm supposed to care? I'm broke. No money for fun. You disappeared for two days with that Jap. She spent all your money, true? I'm not up for chasing skirts. I'm busy with my thesis. You think Alberto's stupid? You go off with that broad, You think "the sucker can wait". I'll go back home to work on my thesis. I'm falling behind. And now you're telling me? - For how long? - As long as it takes. To show you how much I care, I'll come over for free. You can afford beer and cigs, right? 15 lei, that's all. Let's drink here and leave it at that. We'll meet when we meet. When you didn't come, I thought something had happened to you. I'm coming with you. I told you, can't do it. Why? I told you. Vasi doesn't want to see you there. What if he moves out? What then? Vasi said that? Yes, from the start. - Fuck that bugger. - Have a cigarette. You really had to bring me to this jungle? Let's fuck that Jap together. Her voice gets me hard. Forget about the Jap. Let's do something else. Wait. Who's there? What are you doing here, loser? Beat it! You deaf? - Let him be. - Want to die? Can't you see he's a junkie? Let him be! Beat it, you stupid fuck! Let him be! Filthy fucking hobo! - I'm out of here. - I could kill you stinkers. You scare children in parks! They step on your fucking needles! Hey, wait. Damn hobo shits! I sucked cock in prison, bro. I was 15, the youngest. Four guys jumped me in the showers. They made me suck all their cocks. I was the smallest, what could I do? In three years, no one came to see me. But I had everything I needed. The guys brought me coffee, cigs, food. No one could suck cock like me. Life was good, better than out here. I was a poor kid. Six brothers, raised by Grandma. On Sundays she sent us to church to beg. We'd go to bed hungry. After I got out, I didn't tell a soul what I did in there. But my family still found out. For a year, I didn't eat at their table. I had my own spoon and plate. I wasn't allowed to touch my nephews. They took me to church, made me drink holy water and swear to the priest. Swear I'd never do it again. But see, for you I broke the oath. Get on top of me. You crazy? I'd break your ribs! You heard me! Get on top of me. That's enough. How did it feel? Like being run over by Borcan's Touareg? Totally crazy. - I'm calling a taxi, OK? - Sure. Come on. I'll only be a minute. - Give me another month to find money. - Not my business. I'd like a taxi at 31 Iacob Street. You still owe me the guarantee. Keep the money for the last week of this month. Where could I get that kind of money? From your homos and hobos. What's up? You're not happy to see me? Sure I am. Vasi was downstairs with his girlfriend. What's his problem? He's afraid of you. Does he think I'll kill him? I won't, I'm all good now. He wanted a change of air. Kiss me. That's all I get? Don't I deserve better? You're clueless. Give me a massage, my back is killing me. That feels great. That's where it hurts real bad. - Here? - Yes. Press harder, love. Do it like you mean it. Great! Like this? That's why I'm crazy about you, love. Since he's gone, how about we move in together? That was quick. How do we pay the rent for two rooms? Then the cigarettes, the food... We'll manage somehow. Do you love me? I can't tell you I love you. Three years with my girlfriend and I still couldn't tell her. That's why she left you! The dick is not enough. You need sweet talk - honey, my love, my life. Or she gets bitter and leaves you for good. Get smart, bro. "I love you" - see how easy it is? Five-four. Five. And four. Shitty dice. You touch it, you move it! In prison you get beat up for this. Either you move it or you don't. Fuck it, I'm sick of this. - And the game? - Fuck the game! - You got a short temper. - So do we do anything tonight? I can't fall asleep until I've "blown my nose". Sure. But with a condom. Why's that? You were in prison for 14 years. You got fucked in all the holes. No offense. How do I know you don't have AIDS? Me, AIDS? Are you wrong in the head? You look more the AIDS type, stick-man. How could I have AIDS? Check this out! And your hobo girlfriend at the train station? Who knows who she screwed? Cristina was cleaner than you and your ass-fuckers! I even donated blood for food stamps. Think Borcan would let me near his family if I was sick? That station is full of hepatitis. No way I'm putting on a cock sock. Showering alone? Stop shouting, my head hurts. - Am I not your love? - There's no room! We shower together, or we split. Wash my back. Come on, wash my back! Kiss me. That's right, wifey, look after your sweet man. Keep him washed, ironed and fed. You don't even know how to shave. Pass me that. The cell boss would always make me do this. "Berty, get working!" I shaved him all the time. We need to talk, love. Talk about what, Berty? Should I stay? It's the second night I don't go home. I've never done this since I came to live with Borcan. You're a grown man. Tell him you found a woman in Rahova. You know what he did last time I stayed with you? He slapped me around. "Where were you, you ungrateful tramp?" Then he slapped me hard. He said "Do it again and I'll throw you out." "I take you in from the street and you do this?" "Hang around with filthy homos?" Then wham!, another slap. Stop kissing me. Yesterday I wanted to go and you stopped me. That's two nights I've been gone. Borcan's no idiot. He's figured out I'm with you. So what do we do, Berty? So? If I leave, I'm gone for good. I'll have my miserable life, you'll have yours. Think it through, what you'll do about me. Give me some time to think. At least for a few days. You'll miss your family, you're not used to being alone! We can drink up my money. All of it. It's best if you stay with your cousin. I don't have money for two people. That's my destiny. To hang around men's asses. If God wanted otherwise, He'd give me a woman! So I'm leaving, right? And we stop meeting. Think this through very well. You need a pack of cigs a day. - I can smoke less. - Like hell you can. Fine, stay. But don't raise hell if there's no money for smokes. Or no money for beer. - I'll see you out there. - OK. What is this, baby girl? Now she's upset. Here, baby girl. There, baby. She's just playing. Here, play with it like it's your mum's cunt! - Do you speak Romani? - Yes. I have a problem with that. I just won't lick pussy. That's filthy, licking pussy. Where I'm from, that's a no-no. I agree with that. - How can you kiss your children then? - True. - But I have a friend who... - Likes licking pussy? That's not normal. It's perverted. And he means it! He'd rather lick than fuck? Yes, he's not satisfied if he doesn't taste cunt. From now on we share, OK? - There, for you. - Have another smoke. Here you go, love of my life. Does it go "beep"? Stop it, you lunatic! Wait, idiot, people will see. - So what? - Children will see us. We're not in Ferentari. You're out of your mind! You're right, we don't care. We're not in Ferentari here. We're grown-ups. - Gimme a kiss. Look at the ass on that one. Jump in! Jump in, fatso! What phones do you have? For now, just these. - How much? - 100 lei. - You like it? - Nothing with a touchscreen? You can't afford that. Săndel! Pass me that Samsung. 300 and it's yours. - It's just like Borcan's. - It's fake. The battery won't last. This, fake? I wouldn't trick you! I'm selling it cheap, I need the money. - 200 and it's a deal. - No way! Let's see something else. Make up your mind before the police come. - Buy me that, or I leave. - Too expensive. You let money decide for you? We can buy the Nokia, it's a good phone. I'll even get you a memory card. Fine. With a card. -Yes, we like the Nokia. - Does the speaker work? - It can break windows! It's got internet, a camera... You'll be back for more! Look at this phone. Pink, of all the colours. Can't even let the guys see it. Isn't it sexy? The fuck it is. I'd like to get a job. What job? At the National Railways. As a ticket inspector. To get fat bribes. I see Borcan, run! - Where are you? - On the main street. I can see you, I'm across the street. - Across! - Right, I see you now. I was so scared. My hair was standing on end. Fuck it, I wasted a beer. If he had caught us, we'd be mincemeat. Pity about that beer. I could kill for a smoke. Did you buy any? - Yes. - Leave me one on that sill there. I'll leave it on the fence. Well done, sweetheart. OK. Bye, sweet-cheeks. - See you home. - Kisses. - Me too, sweetie. -Bye. - This is crap. - Just read the subtitles. Wh-aaat will people say? Have you thought about it? Have you thought about it? There ain't no justice. Money sticks to money like lice stick to lice. You've watched it 30 times! My heart feels lighter. I'm done watching. It makes me sad. Move over, my back's killing me. Give me a quick massage, will you? Look at this tummy! What is it, a boy or a girl? Which is it? Don't leave me, my life. I'll die without you. Alright. It's going to be OK. Can't you go alone? I can't stand cops. We can't. They beat me up when I was doing the parking lots. Stop whining. They make me sick. Hello, how can I help you? My friend's lost his ID. Have you declared the loss? - Declared? - Through a newspaper ad. Come back with the ad clipping. But he doesn't have a birth certificate either. He's lost all his documents. Yeah, right. Who has them, the moneylenders? I swear I lost it at the station. - You took it to the train station? - That's where I lived. I lost it, boss, cross my heart. After prison, he was homeless. For 2 years. Are you his attorney? Let him speak! We want to know how he can get a new ID. Will you help us or not? - What's your name? - Alberto Vasile, boss. Your ID number? 179... - ...356... - Forget it. Birth date? July 7, 1979. You're an old client, boy! Three sentences. I've been a good boy for 4 years. I want to get a job, boss. Sorry, you're not registered in Bucharest. Declare the loss, then find a parent, brother or sister to confirm your identity in Feteşti, where you're registered. They need to state you are who you say you are. - How much did you withdraw? - 200. Hope they bring good luck. - I'm keeping it. - Don't be an idiot! - I'll keep it warm. - Give it back! I'll take a train and go to my sister in Feteşti. - 100 is for her, she's poor. - Give it back! Her children are starving. The money might convince her to help. You said your family can't know about me. I miss my nephews so bad, those cute little dicks. I'll sleep over, then call you so we can get my ID. - Swear you'll go. - I swear! On your father's life? on my dad's life! Now do you believe me? - You don't trust me. - Spare me. Once I get my ID, it will all work out. Can't I hold your hand? Why are you pushing me away? Watch out for the tram, you... ...you cabbage-fucker! Do you like cabbage? I don't mind it. It hurts my soul to leave you. What are you doing here? I'm doing your grandmother in the ass! - Why aren't you at your sister's? - Cool it, love. - My cock don't come cheap. - Where's the money? You lost it at the slot machines! - You'll get more by tonight. - You won't see another dime! How about I call Borcan? You're on your own. Wanna bet you'll get me more money by tonight? Quit the posing. Fine. Hello, Borcan? - Is that you? - Who's that? It's Vali. Can you lend me 1000 euro? Vali? Who the fuck is Vali? Vali, man, now you don't know me? Alberto, is that you? You fucked-up faggot! If I catch you and that other bastard I'll break your legs! I know you're in Ferentari, you faggot! - I'm off. - Where to? - You're not going anywhere! - That's not up to you. Get back here! Hey, what's up? I'm busy. Go away. I have some writing to do. How are you? And Dad? Can you transfer me 1.000 lei? I'll give it back from my grant. What's up? I need to write, let me work! My back's killing me. How about a massage? - I told you I have to write! - Oh, come on. I still need to work, you know. - Why so angry? - I'm busy. How can I make you happy? Should I dance? Sing you a ballad? Just name it. You like this cock? It's worth billions. Just look. I like it, but I need a break. Fine. I'll let you write. Make sure you write good, yes? Get to it. Get going, Alberto. Let me write. True. We need money. Can't live without it. Write it real good, yes? I will.

Even if I get 12 years, like my dad. I'll cut your throats. Don't screw with me. Let me know when you win 100.000. Almost there, love. - Hi. - Hello. - What's up? - What kept you? Let me catch my breath. Alberto. Hi. Andrei. - The sofa's more comfortable. - The chair is fine. - Your back will get stiff. - If you insist. Adi, get a beer, please. - Want a Timişoreana? - Why not? My, aren't you pretty! Only you and my mum think so. Man, Ferentari is full of hot boys! You should have taken the bus. You like Ferentari Gypsies? - What's not to like? - Feel this, then. Not bad. You did some lifting in prison. Now I lift beer bottles. 110 kilos! - How much do you give me? - Over 100. - 120. - 120? That's nothing. You're still real pretty. Nice lips. Can I kiss them? Want a massage? Are you any good? That's how I earned my smokes in prison. Lie down, I'm an artist at it. - Where, here? - Yes, put your feet up. - Right now? - Yes, right now. - He gives good massages. - I'm a pro! Let's see what he can do. - Like this? - Yes, stretch out. Perfect. How was it? Make him a masseur. He's great. Who would hire him? Maybe with some help. Maybe it's for the best. He'd become a whore and you'd lose your "model". Not gay men. Only your rich female customers. Rich people are complicated. Please, we can't pay the rent. We can't stay in Ferentari. My relatives will break our legs. Adi, you're in love now... You don't see things clearly. Who'd let a huge Gipsy in their home? - We're out of bread. - No need, we have rice. There. Your flesh is really firm! Take me home tonight. Let me use your address for my ID and I'll fuck you for free. Maybe if we lose 60 kilos. Stop touching me, let me eat. Your address on my ID and I'll do you 7 times. Your own cousin didn't let you use his. You'll die fat! You'll never lose weight. Why are you acting like that? I've lost my appetite. Did you go to the seaside this weekend? Just for a bit. Put on some proper fun music. I went with some guys. Put on "Gypsy Heart"! - Were they pretty? - It's a matter of taste. You can tell me. You know one of them. Really? Who is he? A guy from work. - You like this song? - Oh, he's hot. Sorry, I don't listen to manele. - You don't like manele? - Not really. I don't think I'll see the sea this year. That's a pity. That's my life. - You're both young. - Hush! You have your life ahead of you. Sexy show tonight! Girls, I'll fuck both! - I'll go soon. - He has a boyfriend. It's not even midnight. Stay over. He tells me what to do! Leave him alone. Andrei is tired. Watch your mouth! Stop bossing him around. Don't let him order you around. You support him, you rule here. Got fired up, bro? You don't really turn me on. You're the size of a tractor! I like them skinny too. Yeah, right. You were hoping for another sucker like him. I just want an ID. Everyone gives me advice. But no one helps. He's your toy, not mine. You're my friend! It's not a lot to ask. If you get bored, you'll just disappear. But my address would stay in his ID. How about that NGO you work for? He has no ID, no birth certificate. To get either one, you need the other. I've heard it a thousand times. Then what's the use of those NGOs? The law is stupid. Then change the law. I'm off, my taxi is here. You haven't even eaten. I'll go home. You're not going anywhere! This is Ferentari, you leave when I say! Leave him alone. - You're not so cool now! - Leave him alone! Stay out of this or I knock you out! - See you. - Bye. Beat it! Your friends are shit. Who does he think he is? This sucks. Borcan, if you could see me now! Being pushed around by faggots! I'm screwed because of you, I can't go around Ferentari anymore. You're screwed? Don't you like getting screwed? You ruined my life, took me away from my family. Now you throw me out? on my life, I'll do something crazy! It will be all your fault! "More money, love," that's all you know! If I'm the love of your life, how come you blow my last dime? I can't go back to Borcan. Uncle Mircea won't answer my calls. This is killing me! My sister still talks to me, but she doesn't know what I do. So? "So?" If you fuck, you pay! OK, this does it. I'll go withdraw money. But I won't have you back here. Alright? Please, Mum, I'll be good! Stop throwing stones, or you're coming back inside! Let's run! Hi, Ma'am! Scam, you crazy junkies! I thought I'd never get back home. Well, you're here now. May I die run over by a car if I ever play the slot machines again. Good for you. I made an oath in church. Well done! Keep it up. I'm hungry. What do we eat? We can make love. We'll eat bread and raw onion. There's some chicken backs in the freezer. We can fry them. I love gnawing on them. You're such a hot girlie! I know what you're thinking. What? - I know, but I won't say. - Fine, don't. Hug me. Hug me and pet me. In prison... They'd fuck you and, if they didn't like it, they'd punch you from behind. I went to whores, but whores won't pet you. Pull on my tits, love. You know what I miss? Borcan's dogs. They were my soldiers, only listened to me. I loved them so much, I'd let them sleep in my bed. Are you free? To the train station, please. You can leave it. Hello, I'm the pizza boy. Is that you, Alberto? Happy birthday. - You remembered. - Your bro knows! - Guess what I'm doing now. - Tell me. Having a beer and some grill with my old lady. - At Borcan's? - Doing the parking by the station! We have one life and one asshole. And even our asshole isn't ours! What about Borcan? Fuck him, he's not the only one who can make money. This is good money too, if you stay away from the cops. What can I say, Alberto? Keep it up. Thanks for calling me, bye. Do you still love me, even one bit? You stingy bastard, I hope your jeep catches fire! Go back to Borcan, you idiot! That's no life. He won't have me. He's found another servant. I went to my dad's grave today. May he rest in peace. Are you having a beer for his soul? I want to get a tattoo of Dad. You know anyone who makes nice tats? Right on the heart. If you can trust me, will you live with me? I can't afford it, Alberto. I'll come to Bucharest in spring and find you a cheap place to rent. You're so cold. Remember when you showered with me? Hurry and come to Bucharest, I'm dying here. I'll come to you, I miss you so much. I freaking told you, you can't ever come here!
