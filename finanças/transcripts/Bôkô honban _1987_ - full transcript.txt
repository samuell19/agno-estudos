Boko Honban aka 'Pleasure Kill' Yes? What are you doing here so early in the morning? Well, there's a little something... Uhm, Mom, there's a trial experiment today, right? For the new mental stabilization drug. I won't get in the way, so would you let me observe? Sorry to disappoint you, but I can't allow it. Outsiders can't just come in. Even if you are my son. Hello? Yes. That's right. I understand. I'll head over there now. Yes. I'll be back soon, but stay put. If I can't observe it, I'm going home. I see. That's too bad. As for the mental stabilization drug that you're going to be using this time, it is scheduled to be released as a product next year, and this experiment is the final step. Up to now, we've done various animal testing, and it is guaranteed to be safe. There are absolutely no side effects to be worried about. Please be calm and cooperate with the experiment. Thanks a lot for today. I was able to collect a lot of useful data today. Now then, here is what you were promised. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'll contact you later, because I'll have to check up on you for a week in case of side effects. Yes. - Again, I can't thank you enough for today. - Thanks a lot. Hey, we got the money, so wannna go to Roppongi after this? Nice. Let's play at Katon for the first time in a while. Riko, what are you gonna do? I'm going home today. It seems I'm a little tired. I see. How disappointing. If I don't go out for even a single day, my mother will think that there's something wrong with me! That's just you. Lately, it seems you've been staying up late, working hard. What on Earth are you studying? In brief, the connection between physical and mental pain. What do you mean? Humans don't need pain or distress. On the contrary, I believe it hinders the human instinct that is the pursuit of happiness. That's why, we should get rid of stuff like that. I want to change structures in the brain center, so that the nerves that sense pleasure will be linked with various emotions. Wait just a minute. Are you considering that stuff seriously? But since I can't use human test subjects, it's nothing but fictional research. Eiji, you do know about your father, right? The scientific committee decided that certain research of his was unethical, and he was kicked out of the university. He went insane and committed suicide. I'm different from father. I won't ever use people as guinea pigs. Mother is very worried about you. Lately, you seem just like your father. I knew it. It was you. You were peeping on the roof of the college, weren't you? That's because I wanted to observe the process of the experiment. What a strange interest. My mother wouldn't let me in. Your mother? You don't look much like her. That has nothing to do with it. Well, whatever. Ordinary flirting is boring, anyway. Eat? It's a childish game, isn't it? I've read something about it in a book. When engrossed in playing a video game, the brain emits alpha waves. "Alpha waves"? What's that? Brain waves that come out when humans meditate, and enter a trance state. In other words, the brain can be developed through video games, and we can bring about new potentials. Hello? Oh, Papa? Yes. I'm fine. Yes, but I'm still in the middle of it. Yes. I understand. Yes. Bye. - It was your father? - Yes. That game is a product of Papa's company. But I'm the one who designed it. If the human brain changes through video games, then it'll happen to me first. Don't you ever feel like going home? All the time. We're alike, aren't we? I've felt that way since before. Surely, we won't be able stay apart. Ow! Tomoko! What are you doing? What's the matter? Get it together! Tomoko! Hey! It's okay. Riko! I'm afraid of what I'll do to myself. The sensations of my body are... Keep it together. We'll go to the hospital together tomorrow. Okay? Riko! Help me! Taeko Tada and Tomoko Nakajima... participated in a Jonan University cerebrophysiology department laboratory's experimental testing of a new drug. According to the police, it appears that the drug had something to do with them committing suicide. They say are going to question the person responsible for the experiment, Ms. Kureyuki, concerning the circumstances. Very well, onto our next story... Eiji... You... It's different, right? Mother... Once more... from the beginning. Mother! No! - It's different. - Eiji! It's not that, Mother! Stop it. Eiji, no. No. It's different. It's not that. I'll do it once more from the beginning. No! Stop! Stop! Shut up! Goodbye. Everyone's insane... insane. Now we can be together. After experiencing the video game, I knew my true self. And here, I thought I was a calm person. In the game, I was a mighty warrior, who always smelt of blood. When I slaughtered the enemy, pleasure ran through my body, like an electrical current. I felt fear and sadness through my skin, and was able to sweat and shed tears.
