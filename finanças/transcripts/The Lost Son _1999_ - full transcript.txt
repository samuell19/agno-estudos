Mmm. I love you. - Taxi! Edgerton crescent. - Okay. Hup! Mrs. Carlton? Excuse me. Yes? What? You made my job easy. You always take the same room. How much is my husband paying you? Not enough. This is blackmail. Business. Here. You're not a very nice man, are you, Mr. Lombard? I just saved your marriage, Mrs. Carlton. Thanks. Buongiorno. Um, I would like some olives, please. So you've been well? Very well. And you? I am well, thank you. Oh, okay. - Tutti va bene, eh? - Ah. I'll take it. Thank you. Good-bye. Good-bye, sir. Hi, kids. I can beat you. You're losing it, Xavier. You think so? I know so. What happened to that Gallic flair? Went up in smoke. You want to have a drink? I'd love to. Wife and kid are waiting. Hello? Carlos. Oh, uh-- uh, oui. How are you? 10:15. Okay. To the Ritz? Oh. Hey, Carlos! Carlos! Hey, Xavier! How are you? Ca va? You look great. You too. But they made you chief of police or what? No. I'm not a cop anymore. Since when? Uh, since this. Oh-ho-ho. Big changes, eh? Big changes. I left Brazil. I live here now. How long? Uh, three years. Uh, I should've called before. No. I understand. No. I should've called. You did, no? London's the last place I thought you'd end up. It's okay. I like it here. No one knows me. Can't be too good for business. I thought this was pleasure. Well, it is, But, um... I might have something for you. It's a family matter. They're waiting upstairs. Oh. That is your third. Since when do you drink so much? Since this morning, I think. Just around the time your plane touched down, mother. You taught her well-- too well. And this is Xavier Lombard. Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Spitz and my wife, Deborah. Mrs. De Moraes. Thank you for coming, Mr. Lombard. Uh, please. Um, may I smoke? If you must. Uh, how much has Mr. De Moraes told you? - That your son is missing. - It's not the first time. It won't be the last. Our daughter does not share our concern for Leon's well-being. My brother's always had a long and meaningful relationship with heroin. - That is in the past. - That is what you want to believe. I apologize, Mr. Lombard. This is a very difficult time for us. I understand. Maybe Deborah can explain more. A month ago, Leon came to me wanting to borrow some money, a thousand pounds. Something to do with a deposit on exhibition space for his photos. Ah. He's a photographer? My, you're some detective, Mr. Lombard. Deborah, please. The truth is, Leon has not been seen since. He'll surface when he's blown my money. If he's still an addict, the thousand pounds is already gone. He wouldn't last a month. So, where is he? Will you take the case, Mr. Lombard? We are very worried about leon. I normally charge 350 pounds a day... Plus expenses. I doubt you charge anything like that much normally. Three hundred fifty pounds a day, plus expenses. And a bonus of, uh, 5,000 pounds when you find him. We have prepared a package. It contains a down payment on your fees. You can always contact us here or at my daughter's in Hampstead. My husband and I will be staying in london for as long as it takes. What do you think? I think deborah is right. Leon's done this kind of thing before. Just take the money. They can afford it. Where does it come from, their money? Shoes. The old man supplies the leather for a quarter of all the shoes made in europe. You work for him? Yeah. Hey, it's not as boring as it sounds. No, no. Eh, I'll call you, huh? Pleasure, not business. I hope. Ciao. Ciao. Nathalie. Oh. Non. New messages. You have no new messages. Sorry. The number you have called is not available. B. T. Customer accounts. How may I help you? Yes. I have a problem with my phone bill. May I have your phone number please? 0171... 727 6865. Right. How may I help you, sir? The phone was disconnected. We disconnected the phone, but we never got the final bill. Right. It was sent on the 16th of last month. It never arrived. Maybe you sent it to the wrong address, no? Well, it went to the forwarding address at Landguard point, Felixstowe, in suffolk. Hello? - Hello? - This is private property. Public footpath's over there. I'm looking for leon spitz. Right.

Back inside. Look, uh, I don't want any trouble. Just give leon my card and tell him to call me. I can't. I don't know where he is. Haven't seen him for a month. If you want to talk, uh, I'll listen, But not with that thing pointing at me. That's my old number. I was moving up here the night that leon called. - What did he want? - A favor. To look after shiva for a few days, Bring him up here with me. He gave me some money. How much? About a thousand pounds. Thank you. Who is the austrian? Someone who deals in kids. Kids? Yeah. Sex. Sex with kids. Quoi? Shiva was being held somewhere in london, and leon got him out. That's all I know. He said I wasn't to contact him. I was to guard shiva with my life and-- And trust no one. Does he understand english? Yeah. A few words, I think. But he doesn't speak, so-- He cries a lot at night. Come here. I want to show you something. Leon gave me this. I don't have anywhere to play it here. He said I wasn't to give it to anyone. Thank you. How long have you known each other? Why? His family didn't mention you. Hmm. Almost two years. I've never met them. Probably think he's still on drugs, do they? Could he be? They've never understood him. They didn't even visit him once in the clinic. Paid the bills, though. I'll be in touch. There isn't a phone. Ah. I'll be in touch anyway. Smile, emily. We'll find him. Hello. Hello, lovely, pretty fish. Hello. This is roger carlton. I received your report on my wife's movements. Needless to say, I feel somewhat foolish. I'll be sending you a check for your services. Good-bye, mr. Lombard. Uh, hello. It's paul here. Uh, look, I got too many players for next week's game, And I thought you might want a break 'cause of your knee. Uh, just give me a call sometime, all right? Mr. Lombard, this is mr. Spitz. We were hoping for a progress report. I'd appreciate it if you gave us a call. Once upon a time, in a beautiful castle, lived a king and a queen... Who were very happy because a baby princess had just been born to them. But a small, black messenger flew to the 13th fairy, Who had not been invited to the feast, And told her what was going on. - The 13th fairy was a wicked-- - Look at me. Get him to look at me.

What do you mean, someone had beaten you to it? Leon's flat-- someone had been there before me. How do you know? There were no messages on his answering machine. So? So, the last call leon made from his phone was a month ago. - How do you know? - Because I know. Don't take that tone with me, mr. Lombard. now, deborah. Please, mr. Lombard, you are saying you find it unusual... Leon's answering machine has no messages on it? Leon isn't exactly big on friends. Leon has friends. Good friends. He chose not to share them with you. Someone had been there before me and erased his messages. I was there three days ago. Everything was the same. Were there any messages? No. Had it occurred to you leon might have come back and erased them himself? That is possible. Yes, it's possible. But-- but I have a, um, A bad feeling about leon. I'm telling you this, because I think you should know. What are you saying, mr. Lombard? I'm saying, uh-- I hope I'm wrong. Stay here. I have a bad feeling too, mr. Lombard. It's about you. You know a good thing when you see it. You're taking my parents for a ride. You had no right to upset them the way you just did! Why are you so keen to believe your brother's okay? I don't think he's okay. I think he's a fucked-up little shit. You must've seen his photos. I like them. Oh, come on. It's a world I know. It's not your world. Tell me, mr.

You have to go to the police. You killed a man, xavier. You've gotta go to them. You've gotta explain. You can't do this on your own. No one else is going to, huh? I'm scared. You're right to be scared. You're right. Look. I know these people. Even if we go to the police, they find us. I have to do this, and I'm sorry, but... You have to be strong. Now-- now, be careful. All right? Ciao. Good-bye. Mr. Lombard, this is anton spitz. It is imperative that you call us. There is a matter of some urgency... We must discuss with you. As you see, I have made some inquiries of my own. Detective xavier lombard, indicted for murder, Pleads self-defense successfully thanks to the testimony of the only witness, Detective carlos de Moraes. So... I was acquitted. The press called it a "travesty of justice. " Don't expect me to weep over monsieur Tournier. He had my family murdered. Allegedly. I know he planted the bomb that killed them. - Like you knew he was a major drug trafficker? - He beat the charge. When he was leaving court, he said to me: "I know where you live. " Two days later, my wife and daughter were dead. Five words gave you the right to turn judge, juror and executioner? I fired in self-defense. I doubt that very much, mr. Lombard. But, then, only you and carlos know the truth of what really happened. Think-- think what you like. Oh, I do. I think you're a bad man. I think you're a dangerous man to be around. I think carlos had extremely poor judgment taking you for this case. And so do we. I think what my father's trying to say is you're fired. Mr. De Moraes has argued very hard in your defense. Mr. De Moraes has good reason to be biased. We do not. The settlement of your account. I've included a small bonus, Which should more than cover any expenses you have incurred. Apparently, you have found leon's girlfriend. We should like to know where she is. Sure. Oh, uh, I don't have her number with me. I'll get it to you. Can we talk in private, please? Well? How dare you-- he's dead. Leon is dead. Dead? Murdered. Did you love your brother? Yes. I think he loved you too. Now, what happened? What went wrong between you? The drugs. I don't believe you. Damn you. What happened? Let go of me. Let... Go! No. You can't stop me now. This isn't about leon anymore. Deborah, what is it? What did he say to you? What else don't I know about you? Oh, deborah, please. Merci. Merci beaucoup. - Si, senor. Friedman! What do you want? You don't want to do this. Hey. Can you help me? Can you untie me? Get! No, no, wait! Whoo! - Where's friedman? - The boss wants to know what you know, So I can kill you or you can tell me: Why you here, what you want, who you told, all that shit. I don't talk with you. I want to talk to friedman. You talk to me. So kill me. I want to talk to friedman. - Talk to me. - I want to talk to friedman. I want to talk to friedman! I want to talk to friedman! Friedman! Friedman! I can't deal with this right now. Try and look as though I should have confidence in you. Right. We can transfer the first 25 to l. A. As planned. Then we'll just take it from there. Friedman! Friedman! No, don't-- just ignore him. Take the kids to the house. Friedman! Friedman! Thank you. Friedman! Friedman! Shut up. Wait outside. Shut up! You're frightening the children. - So why are you here? - You like children, don't you? I'm not a customer, mr. Lombard. I'm a businessman. Import-export business. Let me tell you something. These children are from the streets. I liberate them. I clothe them and feed them. You mocking me? You? Look at you. How did you protect your family? I don't know what you thought you could achieve. You're not going to change anything. Now, you've caused a lot of trouble already, left a very good man dead. A lot of trouble. So. Hopper? Porfirio! All right. - Oh-oh! Ooh-ooh! I don't think he knows a damn thing. I'm not interested in what you think. I wanted to hear what he had to say. I've been working on it. Look at him. I asked you to do the simplest thing. I could work on him some more. Kill him. Look. Look, nina. Can you untie me? Please. Please. Por favor. Go to bed. Cigarettes? Vamos! Where the fuck are you, you piece of shit? Shh. Hopper! Where's leon? He was dealt with, all right? He was interfering with the business. Where's leon? Hopper! All right, if you want. Yeah, he was killed, okay? What was leon's connection? Look, If this is a question of money-- Of money? How much for nathalie's life? Tell me. No, no. Not I. No. You murdered her, xavier. You involved her in this pathetic crusade. What the fuck did you expect? How much? 500,000. I want more. Look at me. Look at me, friedman. Open your eyes. I'm sorry. Gracias. Uh, we are thirsty. Mr. Lombard, this is deborah, deborah de Moraes. I need to talk to you. Please phone me back as soon as you get this message. Hi, xavier. It's paul. You didn't call me back. I hope you're not sulking because of me last message. I'm not giving you the old elbow. Call me, mate. It's me again. Deborah. Please call me as soon as you get this message. Christ. What happened to you? I've done it. What if it doesn't work? It'll work. Leon's trail led to mexico, Where I found a man called friedman. He admitted killing your son. I'm sorry, mrs. Spitz. Did you kill him? Did you kill this friedman yourself? Thank you. - Have you been to the authorities? - I wanted to tell you first. It's over, then. Not quite. I passed by my own flat on my way here. There was a message on my machine-- A woman, a friend of leon's, phoning from some pub. It sounds like she has a boy. The boy leon rescued? That boy? Maybe. We will see he's well looked after. The same goes for you, mr. Lombard. Mr. Lombard, it's emily. If you've got any news about leon, Please could you contact me at Landguard point, Felixstowe? Thanks. Bye. Telephone number 013-- Listen. This is between you and me. Okay? Now-- now, look. Point the gun down-- down slowly, slowly. And squeeze. Slowly. Look. One. Stop. Not like this. Like this. Here. Now-- wait here for me. Drop it, carlos. You knew. I wasn't sure. How? Friedman knew too much. It had to be one of you. Why? Why, carlos? What happened to the man I knew? I don't have to explain myself to you. But kids? They are just kids. And deborah. Are you going to tell her that you killed her brother? He was always sniffing around. It's big money-- more than you can imagine. Are you trying to bribe me, carlos? I don't need to bribe you. You owe me. You wouldn't have lasted a week in prison. Tournier's men would have seen to that. You owe me your life, xavier. I know that. On the floor. On the floor. On the floor now! Get up. Go. Austrian-- austrian. Austrian? Friedman's little joke because I married one. Give him the fuckin' gun. - Hello, shiva. - Stay away from him. - But I can't. Now you understand? Good-bye, xavier. - Stay there! look at me. Huh? Look-- you bitch! Look at me. My dear friends, we are assembled here... To remember leon spitz, who was so brutally murdered, God rest his soul. Throughout his life, he was a constant source of comfort and pride... To his parents, family and friends, All of whom have been left... With sorrow in their hearts. I didn't know. That's what you're thinking, aren't you? That I knew about carlos? Am I? I didn't know. Why did you fight me, try to stop me? You wouldn't understand. But you want me to. That's why you are here. When leon came to borrow the money, he said something about carlos. What did he say? Did he tell you about the children? Is that what you really think of me? Did he tell you about the children? No. He said he was onto something, something that carlos was involved in, that's all. You didn't want to hear, even when leon disappeared. I-- I did. I wanted to tell you. That's why I called. That's why I left those messages. He was my husband, for god's sake. How could I allow myself to believe he would do anything to leon? You must understand that. All I understand is people have been killed. My friend died. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about your friend. Yes, I think you are, But you don't have to live without her. Carlos was your friend too. Would you have believed it? If you'd told me sooner, maybe she'd be alive. That's all I understand. Don't come to me for absolution. Goal's in the... Area. Five behind. - James gets there just first. The Frenchman with passion. He could give them what they wanted and leave them high and dry. When the seagulls... Follow the trawler, It's because they think... Sardines will be thrown into the sea. Thank you very much.
