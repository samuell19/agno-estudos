Your sister used to sneak into your room, and suck you off. Fucking asshole! To completion. And look, I'm not judging you for it bro, I'm not. Look, You were a guy, she was a girl, coming onto your room, especially at that age, I mean what are you going to do, human nature. Look, if it was me bro, and I had a sister and she did that, please, I'd probably have six retarded children, running around right now. I was just a kid, I mean what the fuck did I know, I could barely not get a hard on. There she was sneaking into my room and shit, Jesus! I mean it's my fucking room man, can you believe that.

They drew their guns first. No, no! Yes, they did! You're covering for them, no they didn't. You know full well there are no guns allowed, in any of the rooms that Peaches is running. It's the main reason, we went in there in the first fucking place! You know it, I know it, everyone fucking knows it. It's the much Bali Hood rules, of Peaches. No, it was Rudy, No it wasn't. It was fucking Rudy! Rudy! Outlines this cape with a bean. Nothing but, golden fucking hues. And to be honest, Mia Copa, something was nagging at me right from the start. Cos I'm thinking, these guys are diggers. That's what they do, they did holes. I need a hole dug, they can dig it. Put a body in the hole. Maybe! Want a hole, yes. That they can do. Rudy's the, caper, he's like a caper. A real life fucking caper. Well! The guys got ambition, I can applaud that. But Tom, you sat right there. You sat right there next to him. How's your stomach? Fucking hurts. Barry hits hard. You know Barry, he used to be, really like this, MMA guy, you know. Ever seen any of those fights on ESPN? You gotta be fucking nuts. Should have been easy money, Tom. And isn't the first fucking time with this Rudy either. And now I've got this, big fucking problem because of the way it went down. So, I'm thinking and I ask myself, why am I sitting here tossing and turning, when I know what's, gotta get done, is gonna get done! And Tommy, is gonna fix it. I'll fix it, I'll talk to him. Talk to him? Tommy, you're horrible, this has gone way beyond the sit down. You have to clean up this whole fucking mess Someone has to go under the buss on this one. How'd it go? He's pissed! Fuck him, hey what's it matter? Fucking Barry hoofed me in the stomach. Barry? Yes Barry, he's MMA as it turns out. Fuck, that guy's MMA! You know, they gotta declare that shit. What do you mean, declare? Before they get into a fight with you, they gotta say, hey man these hands can kill. Suppose to declare that shit. He didn't fucking mention it. He's a dick. Where your shades bro? Yoh. Boom, I'm a beast what! Shit from Montreal. Myster wants him moved, so we gotta dig him up. When? Tomorrow. Come on man, you know I don't wanna do that.

How the fuck, do you forget that! Mr. Myster. I need the fucking hands Tommy. I gotta have them. But I did it! Well until I have his hands in my hands, how do I know that? Mr. Myster. I need the hands, Tom. It's policy. I don't have them. I will repeat my position on the matter until I have proof. For all know he's still fucking up right. Right? Dig him up if you have to. No. Sorry? You go out there and you do it. Say that again. I'm not gonna dig up Rudy. Why do you go out there and you do it yourself! Tom. Have you gone mentally fucked, or something? Why don't you go out to the desert, you fucking piece of shit, and you dig up Rudy. And you cut off his dick, or his fucking hands, or whatever fucking body parts you want! Or you have Barry do it, that fuck! You have him fucking do it. Ok Tom look, let's just, let's just back this up a bit ok. I agree, I was, being, aggressive and, you said you did it, you did it. I understand you had a little tussle with Barry. He cut off my fucking finger! Ok that, is unacceptable! Unfucking acceptable. You know Barry though, he's a free wheeler. You can't control that guy. But I did not authorize that, Tommy. Losing your finger, I did not authorize that. I'm fucking handicapped, I got no baby finger anymore. Like I said, Tom. The guy's got a mind of his own. I don't want you feeling half cocked about the whole thing. Ok. Let's, let's just chop this one up, alright? Let bygones be bygones. Hello? Uh-huh. Not ideal, it's not ideal. But, let's accept it. You lost the finger, and that's gotta cost for something. Maybe buys you a little leniency, in the whole policy thing. I wish you all the success in your bar tending. I'm not a fucking bar tender! Ok. Ok, hello. Hello. Fucking bar. Senor. Would you like another one? Yeah. Are you guys hiring? Maybe. This restaurant, I ask. I could be a bar tender? Oh no Senor, bar tender very hard. We no hire any bar tenders. You own this place? No, my cousin. You better off not working for him. Hola, it's Gabriella. Please leave a message. Hey Gabriella, it's Tom. Look I didn't just leave, something came up and I had to leave. I just thought you should know. I'm sorry. I know we didn't have a lot of time but, I really like you. Fuck. Look, I'm gonna come back, real soon, so I'd love to see you. Call me. Praise Jesus, Jesus. Yes sir. Hey Gabriella, It's Tom. Call me back. Hey Gabriella. Hi Tom. Look, I'm sorry. It's ok. You maybe wanna get that dinner tonight? Yes, that would be nice. Hey, I can be there soon. I'll see you soon. Ok. Go do your thing. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you, Myster!
