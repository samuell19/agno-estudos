Hold up. Are you sure we're on track? According to the doctor's map, positive. All right then. Let's move! Professor. Don't you think we should consult Dr. Hughes -before proceeding? -Forget Hughes. I'm in command here. Now, move it. [panting] [high-pitched chirping] [sighs] Where could they be? There! [lighter snaps closed] [screams] Did you hear that? It must be Dr. Hughes. Oh, my God. Professor! Professor! We'd better check that out, sir! Wrong. We are too close to turn back now! [warbling] There it is. Marvelous specimen. Oh. It's beautiful. Absolutely magnificent. Peters. Dig. Here? What are you waiting for? Dig! Okay. Okay. [inhales deeply and sighs] -[grunts] -[explosion] [all scream] It's mine. [laughs] [crickets chirping] [radar beeping] [phone rings] Parker here. [crackles] What the...? [man] Okay, all right, I'll get right on it. Goodbye. Oh! Bud Black. I am finally going to bury you. You're going to screw this story up, like always, and then I'll be rid of you forever. And then we'll run with my piece anyway. [laughs] I love this business. Oh, yeah. Dinosaur, my... Oh, what a waste of good ink. Bud? Hey! How the hell are you? Yeah, yeah, no. Sorry, I haven't called. It's been a little slow lately. But I got a big, juicy story for you. Now, listen, I got one word for you: dinosaur. How does that grab you? Well, yeah, I know it's different, but we're changing our image around here, and I wanted you to have the first big story. Great. Great. You got a pen? Okay, now here's the details. Yeah. Uh-huh. Bear. Yeah. Got it. Cool. [rock music playing over car radio] [turns engine off] [camera shutters click] Excuse me. What do you think you're doing? Oh, hi, I'm Bud. I'm looking for Professor... Professor...Professor... Campbell, yeah. I hear he's digging up something pretty exciting here. Yeah, well, this is a restricted area, and there are no photographs allowed. That's right, Mr. Black, so you can take your camera. Mr. Black? You know this man? Yes, I read his article, if you can call it an article, on ancient civilizations in TIME Magazine. He's just another paparazzi looking for a free meal ticket. TIME Magazine? -Very impressive. -Thank you. Welcome, Mr. Black. I'm Dr. Campbell. This is my lead assistant, Holly. Hi. Yeah, pleasure's all mine. So, doc, I understand you unearthed quite a discovery here. Well, I must admit that it's the largest unearthing of its kind. Ever. Really? You think this would be a good story? I'd bet money on it, Mr. Black. Mankind has never seen anything quite like this before. Wait a minute. So just how big is this creature? Dinosaur, Mr. Black. Simply put, Fifty times the size of T. Rex. Whoa, whoa, 50? Did you say 50 times the size of a T. Rex? Are you serious? That's incredible. This is going to be a good story. Come, have some iced tea. Iced tea? Yeah, iced tea. [laughs] Un-freaking-believable! That's incredible! I'm glad you approve. This is big, Mr. Black. The dawn of a new era. [pilot] Control, this is Atlantis Omega 2. Satellite deploy is go. Stand by for OMS burn. Control, we are reading an unidentified radiation spike. Can you confirm? Come in, Control. [man] Omega 2. Base Control calling Omega 2. [rapid beeping] Omega 2. Omega 2, please respond. What's the problem, O'Neil? We lost it. It just vanished into thin air. [footsteps] Shh. I'm not here to hurt you. You must stop this excavation at once. You shouldn't interfere, Dr. Hughes. You desert our team for two years, and suddenly you appear? You're the Dr. Wendell Hughes? [Campbell] You are correct, Holly. And doesn't it just break your heart to see such a great mind, once a leader in the field, reduced to this? An old, senile man who would take great pleasure in sabotaging my greatest accomplishment. Stop the digging now. It'll be too late for any redemption once Yonggary gets his breath. You really have lost your mind, haven't you, Doctor? You just can't accept the truth, that your assistant, me, was too brilliant even for you. I've never confused brilliance with greed and jealousy, Campbell. Who's really jealous here, Doctor? Let me see. I found the hieroglyphics first. I decoded them first. [indistinct chattering] [Hughes] There were more writings in that cave that you don't know about. We don't know what will happen. Escort this old man out of here. Now. Yes! [all grunt] [Hughes] Heed my warning or we're all doomed! Don't you think you were a little hard on him, Professor? I'm sorry you had to witness that, Holly. He's an old man... without vision. What's going on? No problem. Just an old friend stopping by. You'd better get some rest, Mr. Black. We got a big day tomorrow. [thunder crashing] [man] Whoa! [both scream] Come on, what the hell is going on here? [camera shutters clicking] Mr. Black, have you lost your mind? Have I lost my mind? What are you...? Give me my camera-- Give me my camera back! Bad press isn't going to do either of us any good. And from now on, you only photograph what I tell you to photograph. Holly, how did you let this happen? I'm sorry, Professor. They were working the late shift. No one saw or heard anything. Here we go. Here's the culprit. It was just an electrical mishap. Dispose of these bodies and get back to work. Wait a minute, Professor. What now, Holly? Shouldn't we call the authorities? An official investigation has to take place before we can proceed. These men understand the dangers in this business. I mean, this sort of thing happens all the time. To show my gratitude, I will double all your salaries for the remainder of the dig. Gentlemen, we're on the verge of a fantastic discovery. What do you say? Are you with me? All right, guys. You heard the man. Let's move it. I'd like to see you in private, Holly. Right now? Now. What's gotten into you these days? Do you realize what's at stake here? If that gets out to the authorities, this dig is over. Something just doesn't seem right. That was the third so-called "accident" this week. I'm disappointed, Holly. I thought you wanted this as much as me. I do, Professor, but how can you justify the sacrifice of so many lives? Everything has a price, Holly. Think about what's important. Fame and fortune, or obscurity. Leave if you want to leave, but this dig goes on no matter what the cost. The decision's yours. Affirmative, General. We've lost communications with the Omega 2. That's a pretty damned expensive piece of equipment to lose, Captain. What happened? We have a report of receiving a strange signal, sir. Also, there have been reports that two satellites in the vicinity are also missing. Missing? Soldier, you just don't lose two satellites and a shuttle like it's a $2.00 crap game! [sighs] All right, gentlemen. Go to red alert. Switch to airwave transmissions for any further communication. Let's get this taken care of quickly, boys. [Klaxon blaring] [indistinct shouting] [soldier] Let's go! Let's go! [Campbell] You're a lucky man, Bud old boy. You're gonna be famous when this is all over. Yeah? Well, fame doesn't pay the bills, you know. That's true. But did you ever know any famous poor people? Hell, you might even win the Pulitzer if you play it smart. Pulitzer? [laughs] Are you kidding me? I never thought about that. I mean, really I just kind of think of myself as a tabloid photographer, let alone Newsweek. [liquid pouring] Pulitzer. All right? Pulitzer. Their primitive technology has detected our craft. We must commence the invasion now. No. They are powerless to stop us. Resume reanimation. Sure as hell ain't Russian. No, sir. It's alien. [thunder crashes] [Bud] Speaking of news, what can you tell me about this Hughes dude? Good old Dr. Hughes. Once, he was a great leader in our field, but he just... well, let's just say we had our differences. Okay, well, what about your sidekick there, Miss Personality? -Holly. -Yeah, Holly. What's her story? -She's no longer with us. -What do you mean? She get killed too? She left the team earlier today. [laughs] Oh! I thought... Look, I gave the story to you, Mr. Black. I could have given it to anyone. You're going to get everything you want. All you have to do is follow my rules. Yeah. I capisce. [clings cups together] [thunder crashes] [loud warbling] [screams] [zipper rasps] Hello? Hello? [camera shutters click] Such a pity. Did you know that carelessness accounts for 90% of all work-related accidents? These photographs aren't going to do either of us any good. Are they, Mr. Black? Do you want me to do a story or not, Dr. Campbell? I'm a photo journalist! To do a story, I take photographs! Like I said before, if you want this story, you'd better play by my rules. Now give me a hand with this. -Here you go. -Thanks. -That way? -Mm-hmm. Professor. [panting] Professor. What is it? We've got a big problem, sir. What now? It's the fossil. There's been some uncanny transformation. The bones are coming together as if... they are alive. What are you talking about? It's growing fangs. And on top of that, we found another body. That's impossible. We disposed... Never mind. Let's go. [indistinct chattering] -Damn it. -What's next, Campbell? How many lives will it take? It was an accident, hear me? Just like the others. Now, get rid of that. Okay, then. Whoever wants to leave can leave. But don't forget that you're all illegal's, and I'll report every damn last one of you! [man] Come on, guys. Let's go. [Holly] That's why I quit. I just couldn't put up with Campbell any longer. I really think he's losing his mind. Just strange things kept happening. Weird accidents. Professor, you remember Dr. Wendell Hughes, right? Yeah, I thought he was dead too. But he mysteriously shows up at the excavation site last night, and Campbell got all crazy and kicked him out. It's just nuts out there. Professor, I'd like to come back to the university, accept your job offer if it's still available. Great. I'll be speaking to you soon, then. Bye. [knock on door] Who is it? Who is it? -Your blankets. -Thanks. -Mm-hmm. -Here. -Thank you. -Hey, I'm starving. Can I grab a bite to eat here? Um, bar. Okay. -[country music playing] -So... how's Helen? -I don't want to talk about it. -[billiard balls clack] Mm, really? Well, I heard you two broke up. I heard that she's off with some stud in Palmdale. I said I don't want to talk about it. [scoffs] Excuse me. -[sighs] -Hi there. Can I get you something? Hot coffee and a chicken sandwich. So I don't think I've seen you around here before. Nope. Just passing through. I'm Holly. Oh, hi, Holly. I'm Sara Sanders. Oh, I've got to tell you, Sara, it's nice to see another girl's face. I've been surrounded by male testosterone for way too long. And that's a problem? [chuckles] Girl, around this place, finding yourself a man's like winning the lottery. -It's slim to none. -[both laugh] Well, I can assure you, working with a bunch of sweaty bone diggers is no picnic either. You work on an excavation site? Well, I've heard some stories about that place. -Stories? -Well... some of the workers, they come in here. They start talking about some crazy scientist. Talking about some people getting hurt. So, is it true? Dr. Hughes? Hello, Holly. I suppose I should be surprised to see you. May we talk? Look, Doctor, if it's about the dig, I quit today. It's over for me. I'm finished. I know that. That's why I'm here. Please, if I may have two moments of your time. Hey, Holly, is he bothering you? No, it's fine. Okay, Doctor. Talk. In private. Contrary to what Campbell may have told you, I am not crazy. I didn't say you were. I said I quit the dig, that's all. All right, listen to me, Holly. Campbell must be stopped. What's to be stopped? And where the hell have you been, anyway? I mean, let's review. Dr. Wendell Hughes, world-famous paleontologist, mysteriously disappears two years, presumed dead. Sound familiar? All right, you want the truth? Here's the God's honest truth. I was on a dig in Southeast Asia when I befriended an old man, the Shaman of the local village. He told me a story about a sacred cave that had ancient writings all over the walls. And he told me about the legend. -The legend? -The legend of Yonggary. A giant dinosaur. The first one of its kind. Buried there millions of years ago that one day would rise again from the dead and destroy the world. To be honest, I think both you and Campbell are nuts. And I'd love to listen to more of your fairy tales, but I'm tired. -Please, listen to me. -Let go of me. I need your help. I found something else in that cave. A fossil. The remains of an alien species. An alien? Do I look stupid to you, Doctor? I mean, do you really expect me to believe you? All right, then, tell me about Campbell. What's he doing out there? Has there been any strange occurrences around the bones? Yeah, some accidents. Workers killed. I knew it. I knew it. Look, I agree that Campbell's a self-centered egomaniac, but I'm a scientist. I need proof, not ghost stories. All right. But not here. -Someone following you? -I don't know. But, please, let's go somewhere a little more secret. -[power tools whirring] -[man] How you doing over there? -You about done? -[man 2] Yeah, pretty close. Ask the welder. -Hey, buddy. -How you doing? How in the hell are you? You're looking good. But now tell me what the bad news is. -Why do you say that? -Because it's the only reason you ever come to see me. We've got an emergency. We've intercepted an alien spacecraft. It's already attacked twice. I don't know about you, but I don't remember reading anything in the handbook about stopping pissed-off aliens. These are the hieroglyphics I found with the alien fossil. Did Campbell ever show you writings similar to this? No. Never. And you still haven't proven anything. You found some archaic writings some caveman left on his wall. It's happened before. The pyramids in Egypt. The Mayas in South America. But this is different, Holly. This is apocalyptic. "A great light will appear from the heavens, and the great dinosaur will gasp the breath of life." So now you're telling me the fossil is coming back to life. That's my fear, yes. Okay, Doctor. So, why me? I mean, if you're so sure of these events, why not go to the police, or better yet, the government? Holly, that's where I've been the last two years, as a guest of the United States government. -What? -Well, like you, they didn't believe me. And they were too busy studying an alien fossil than to worry about stopping a giant prehistoric monster resurrecting. Look, Doctor, I'd love to believe you. But I don't. All right, then... read this. "DNA analysis. Non-carbon-based organism with unknown genetic makeup. Bone structure: unknown. Classification: non-human, non-animal. Carbon dating results. Specimen fossilized 220-250 million years ago." They're coming back, Holly. I can feel it. And it's somehow connected with Campbell and those bones. I've got to stop him, Holly. If I'm wrong, I'm just a foolish old man. [zipper rasps] But if I'm right... I've got to stop Campbell. Hey, no offense, Doc, but I hope you're as crazy as you sound. Me too. [door opens] [sighs] Doctor, wait! [truck engine revving] This is too weird. I got this crazy-ass control freak professor, a fanatic old man that should be doing tours in a museum somewhere. A cute, bitchy chick. [sighs] More dead bodies than a Tarantino flick, and a 200-million-year-old big-ass lizard. Why the worried look, Mr. Black? In a few hours we'll be heroes. And you'll be the first to record mankind's greatest discovery. You know, Doc, it seems like fame and fortune has a really high price to pay around here. Bud... I've had a good feeling about you since the first time we met. We're a lot alike. We both know what we want... and we'll stop at nothing to get it. [man] Professor, we've uncovered the remaining bones! It's beautiful. Now, Mr. Black... take your pictures and let the whole world see. I'm afraid we're too late. You're absolutely right, Doctor. Take a good look at my masterpiece. Do you have any idea what you have done? [powering up] [thunder crashing] Look! Look at it. It's beginning. [all scream] [shrieking] No! [all screaming] [thunder rumbling] [growling] [roaring] This can't be happening! No! It isn't real! The prophecy has been fulfilled! [roars] This is what you wanted isn't it? No, Holly! I can talk to him! [snarling] What do we do now? Get out of here, that's what. [all screaming] [footsteps crashing] [roaring] You're my creation! I made you! [screams] [roaring] [Holly sighs] What have we done? We've located the target area, sir. -Where? -Forty miles due east of here. Headquarters said it's in the vicinity of an excavation site. There may be casualties. Check it out. You're in charge. Lieutenant, secure the area. Yes, sir. Move out! [soldier] You heard the man. Move out. General... I'm sorry. I got here as fast as I could. Damn governor's ball. I understand we're under attack. That's right, Jack. You're not gonna believe this. It's an alien craft. Hostile. It's already knocked out two communication satellites and a NASA shuttle just in the last couple of hours. Never seen anything like it. Have you considered a preemptive strike? Negative, Jack. Not until we have more data. [Parker] That's quite a story, Doctor. So I've got to go back and tell my commander that we have got a giant 200-million-year-old dinosaur on the loose. And on top of that, he vanishes into thin air when struck by a light from outer space. All right, if it does exist, and that's a big if, Doctor, how do we stop it? I'm not sure. But if that thing gets to the city, we're all doomed. [Holly] The doctor's right. That monster will destroy a city the size of New York like a house of cards. Captain! Captain! You should take a look at this, sir. How the hell am I going to explain this? [computer chirping] -General. -Boom-Boom. Thanks for coming. Don Howell, Jack Thomas. -You know each other, right? -You bet. -How are you doing, Jack? -Fine, I hope. Good to see you. General, I brought you two of our finest. Special Task Force Sergeant Romiski and Michaels. What's your objective, Romiski? Kill the enemy and break their toys, sir. -Good answer. -Dismissed. [both] Yes, sir. General, radar's picked up several, possibly 20 smaller crafts surrounding the ship. Sounds like an attack force. Apparently so. We've also received word Captain Parker has located their attack site. Okay, gentlemen, I want to get this situation under control. Parker needs backup. -Get him a chopper unit. -Yes, sir. [Murdock] What do you got here...? Bravo Company. Bravo Company. This is General Thomas, requesting immediate air support. Repeat, immediate air support. Do you copy? Excuse me, General Murdock? Craft's moving again. Over the Nevada/California border. Tracking due west. Get hold of Parker. Give him the new position. -Yes, sir. -Choppers are airborne, sir. Good. War room. They want to fight? They got it. Alpha One. Alpha One. This is Base. [alien] Invasion forces ready. All Galaxion troops are prepared for duty. Acknowledged. Soon, the Earth will be defeated. Centauri has identified the transmission from a homing device. Dispatch Yonggary. We must retrieve the daemon. [Hughes] Where are you taking us, sergeant? [Archie] Oh, that's top secret, Doc. Order from the pretty boy. -Excuse me? -Captain Parker. His grandfather was a two-star general. So he went to West Point and I went to the Gulf War. It's that legacy crap that helps the climb in rank around here. But, honestly? That guy just doesn't know his butt from a hole in the ground. I was thinking the same thing myself. Yeah. Boy, you sure got him spooked. How'd you do that, anyway? -Do what? -Oh, come on. Dig that hole. You know, I've seen some really crazy stuff before, but that footprint... [laughs] That took the cake. I'm afraid that footprint was very real, sergeant. I'm sure it is. Hey, I guess we got another Roswell on our hands, huh, Doc? You know, like they do in those TV shows. Make aliens look like they've landed in those cornfields. Yeah. I believe you. So, what do we do now, Doctor? Well, we decode this. It contains the rest of the hieroglyphics. [Holly] So if you knew this was going to happen, why didn't we try to find Campbell sooner? I can't say now. Hey, Doc, I was just playing with you. Anything in this jeep is kept top secret. I promise you that. That's my word. Well, when I gave the fossil to the NSIA, they classified it. Which meant I was classified. So I couldn't take the chance on leaving there without knowing that all the information I had was correct. So they concocted the story about you being lost. Dead? Yes. That's part of the cover-up. [laughs] You guys are cracking me up. Whoa! Oh, my God! Jeez, almighty. [roars] What is that? That's your imagination, Sergeant. I can't see. Where is it? Oh, I see it fine. Oh, it's so big. And it's ugly too. Jesus! Oh, it's looking right at us! We got to get the hell out of here! Are you crazy, Sergeant? That thing will smash this jeep like a bug on a windshield. In case you haven't noticed, I don't think it's in the mood to negotiate. Are all soldiers as brave as you in the face of danger, Sergeant? Ah, the hell with you two. I ain't sticking around to be a midnight snack. [grunts] [breathing heavily] [snarls] You got to be kidding me. [roars] -Don't shoot. -Don't worry, Doc. I'm going to try to shoot him between the eyes. You shoot that gun, we're all dead. It's amazing. Look at its skin. That smell. [Hughes] Stay right there, Holly. Do you smell it, Doctor? It smells so... old. Don't move, Holly. It reacts to motion. Oh, we'll see how it reacts to a mouth full of lead. No, don't do it. Wait. -[helicopters flying distantly] -Listen. [pilot] Bravo leader to Flight. Approaching checkpoint ten. Keep it tight and watch the deck. Bravo Flight to Control. Bravo Flight to Control. Have arrived at checkpoint. Coordinates: Victor-Mike-7-7-dot-6. We have no visual. -Repeat, no visual. -[radar beeping] Copy coordinates, Bravo Company. You're on radar. [helicopters approaching] It's the cavalry. Come on, get in the jeep. Bravo 2, do you see this? [pilot] Control, we have contact. Going down to check it out. Roger that. Ten-four. Whoa! Oh, I can't believe what just happened. Hey, Doc, I'm really sorry for doubting you. [Hughes] I hope those choppers can stop it. [roars] Base, we have a visual. on the target. [snarls] [base commander] Roger that. Target in sight. -[pilot] He's a big bastard. -Repeat transmission, Bravo. You're breaking up. I said he's damn ugly. [roars] Commander, going in for a closer look. Roger that. Okay, boys, lay down some cover fire. [snarls] Lock in. On target. Fire. [roars] Bravo. Come in, Bravo. [pilot] Lock missile targeting. Blast him. Fire! Fire! Fire! -Missed him. -The target remains mobile. [roars] I got him point-blank. He's on my tail! [alarm blaring] Mayday! Aah! Blue, my screen's malfunctioning. I'm losing choppers. Four's down. There goes Seven. Three, Eight. What the hell is going on out there? Fire! Die, you bastard! Let's spread out, guys. Watch out for the fireball. Poor guys. -Bravo, is the base. -Damn it. We just can't stop the monster. [base commander] Bravo team, break off, break off. -Yeah, okay, I got it. -What do you got, soldier? Bravo company has reported intercepting a creature. -The craft, have they landed? -No, sir. Bravo says it's some sort of large monster. [alien] It is time. Dematerialize Yonggary. [roaring] What the...? Where is it? It's gone. Base, the target has vanished from radar. Vanished? Look, I want a sensible explanation, and I want it now. Radar confirmed eight choppers down, General. Find out what the hell happened to my choppers. Can I have a word with you, sir? Don, we just got our butt kicked back there. Okay, what is it? Man there says he's from the NSIA. Some government space agency. What does he want? Says he has information about the spacecraft. Okay, let's go. I'm afraid I never heard of it, Mr. Mills. No, sir, you wouldn't have. We're a level-five classified government agency, specializing in alien encounters. I'm not even sure the White House knows we exist. General Howell says you have special knowledge about the alien craft. Yes, sir. About two years ago, a doctor, a Paleontologist, came to us with scientific evidence that an advanced alien species visited this planet over 200 million years ago. It's all right here. Everything you need. Physical data, medical analysis, photos. The works. How long, Mills? Just how long have you known something like this could happen? Between our research time and educated guess, about six months. Six months? You knew about this for six months and you didn't inform us? Wait, wait. Hold on just a minute. Look... this is considered a matter discussed on a need-to-know basis only. What would the military have done, anyway? Send some shuttles up there to intercept them? To head them off and blow them out of the sky? Or build a world defense system to fight off some aliens that might come back to the Earth perhaps someday in the next billion years? Gentlemen, let's be realistic here. The military brass would have laughed us out of town. Okay, point taken. How do we stop it? That's a tricky question. You see, some vital information that holds the key has been taken from our lab. We are tracking it down as I speak. I will say this. We must do everything in our power to capture these aliens alive. [laughs] You must be crazy. We're taking these mothers out. Alive is the last thing I give a damn about. General, the craft has immobilized. Hovering directly above the city. Ground troops, General? Yes, at once. Stick around, Mills. We might need you. You picking up the same thing? -Yes, sir. -Jack? Satellite communication's been reestablished, General. We're getting radar coordinates now. [thunder crashes] What the hell was that? Whoa! Something just hit the atmosphere. -Well, what the hell was it? -Electronic particles. Some kind of, like, force, sir. [roars] Yeah, yeah, satellite coordinates locked in. -Hey, Smitty, you got that? -I got contact. Visual feed in three... two...one... What in the name of heaven? Son of a... [Mills] Oh, my God. Hughes was right. What? Who was right? Nothing, nothing. Mills. You knew about that alien craft. What do you know about this thing? I don't know, I swear. [warbling sounds] Destroy the satellite. What...? Andrews, I've lost communication. Yeah, me too. We've lost visual, General. [thunder crashes] General, target located. It's in the city, sir. Colonel, what the hell is going on out there? [car horns honk] [roars] [tires squeal] [all screaming] Oh, man. Headquarters! Requesting backup immediately! Hello? Hello? Oh, shit. [roars] Hurry. Hurry. I've got an emergency, 61st and 3rd. What? I've got a freaking giant lizard going around, that's what. No, I've not been drinking! [shrieking] Aah! [soldiers] Move! Move! Move! Come on! Come on! Come on! [gunfire] [roars] [screaming] [woman] Look out! General. General Murdock. Sergeant Archie reporting for duty, sir. This is Dr. Hughes and Holly Davis. Captain Parker sent them. What are you doing here? I was about to ask you the same question, Doctor. You two know each other? General, Dr. Hughes is the Paleontologist I told you about. He stole information from our lab, and then disappeared. No, I told you this could happen. What, rantings about a prehistoric monster and the end of the world? You're wrong, Mills. The hieroglyphics were a warning, and you chose to ignore them. General, I have the information right here, if we can decode this. That disc belongs to the agency. -Whoa, slick. -I want that disc! [soldier] General, it's destroying the city. -[all screaming] -[footsteps crashing] [roars] Fire! [roaring] [gunfire] My men are getting crushed. The damn thing's breathing fire again. -Jack, get them air support. -Yes, sir. Eagle Company, this is General Thomas. It's a go. Scramble the F-16s from El Toro in close order. Precision formation. Get them in the show. Mills. [lock beeping] Mills, where do you think you're going? You do not have authority over me. I take my orders from the president. That means you take your orders from me. -Let me out of here. -Sergeant Archie! -Yes, sir. -Get him out of here. My pleasure, General. Come on, let's go, tough guy. -[all shouting] -[soldier] Scramble, scramble. Alert squadron. This is an Alpha scramble. Repeat, this is not a drill. [turbines powering up] [tower command] Flight, you're clear for immediate takeoff. Climb to angle 5-0. Viper strength. See the contact point on Status-Whiskey-Lima-7. It's Showtime. Roger that, tower. The birds are en route, General. [pilot] Flight leaders take point. Keep it water tight, gentlemen. Vipers, are going fangs out. [indistinct chatter] -Look at the dinosaur! -Wow, he's coming towards us. [roaring] [gasps] Look out! [snarls] [all cheer] Approaching target. Flight One, arm missiles. Prepare to engage. Roger that, Cap. I'm red and free. [Captain] This is it, Vipers. Be advised. Watch the collateral damage. I've got a vis, tone and lock. Negative impact. [growling] Let's go again, Vipers. Form up. Flight 2, go in low. Commencing run. Whoa! -Watch out! -I've got him, Viper 3. I have lock. Damn it. How could we miss? I got him. Bullets away. [snarls] Flight 2, connecting hot road. Fire. I've got tone and lock. Fox two. [roars] [screams] Damn! Did he eject? Watch out! I can't! Mayday! Mayday! Punch out! Punch out! What the hell was that? Three planes just fell off my screen. Damn! -He got Mad Dog. -Switching to guns. [roars] Yes, Mr. President. I understand your position. May I request a little more time? We're not getting hits. Switch to Limas. Switching to sidewinders. [roars] Viper 3, come in. Punchy! He wants it stopped now before there's any further damage. Hmm. Easy for him to say. We got five hours to stop it. If not, he's going to drop the bomb. Nuke them? Ha! General, if we drop the bomb on a major metropolitan area, the collateral damage will be significant. [Murdock] I know, but we have our orders. [roars] I've got good tone. Fox 2. All flights form on me. We're going in again. Viper 2, what's your weapon status? One AMRAAM left, Captain. Viper 5, status? [pilot] Stand by, Captain. -[beeping] -No missiles left. Roger, Viper 5. Take point. -You're the decoy. -I'm your rabbit. [roaring] [screams] Pull up! [roars] Where did it go? Can anyone see it? Negative, sir. It's off radar too. General, we lost nine 16s. -[sighs] -AWACS reported a force field around the monster that jammed the target acquisition systems. All our missiles were deflected. Goddamn. Doesn't the thing have any weaknesses? A perfect fighting machine. Okay, Doctor, I hope this program works. Thanks. Is there a code word? [laughs] Yeah. "Daddy loves ET." You're kidding. Daddy loves ET. At least our government has a sense of humor. -[beeping] -[Hughes] Good. It's decoding. "The great dinosaur will be given flesh and blood from the heavens, and his wrath will be cast upon the entire world. And this creature called man will be destroyed by his own intelligence." What intelligence? [Murdock] What's the evacuation status? The commercial buildings are empty, the residential areas are being evacuated now. Okay, what are the alternatives? Well, we need a way to penetrate the force field. What about Project T, that new laser technology -you guy have developed? -No, it's still in production, and the jet packs haven't passed the final safety test. -Is he operational? -Yes, sir. But I must advise of the danger. -Get your T-forces ready, Jack. -Yes, sir. I'll assume full responsibility. Don, get Hughes in here. Hughes. No, get me Hughes. Dr. Hughes. "Once every living thing is destroyed, they will be given new life." "They"? The aliens. -[computer beeping] -Yes, it's all quite obvious now. The alien craft is using Yonggary as a pawn. As a tool to destroy the Earth. Okay, so they must be controlling him somehow. "The dinosaur will raise his head, and the daemon will glow like fire." The daemon? Where did you find this, Doctor? Well, in the cave with the alien fossil. Daemon. Diamond. It's diamond, Doctor. I knew I'd seen this somewhere before. I drew it at the dig site. Yonggary's forehead. The shape. [Hughes] You're right! That's it! "The daemon will be destroyed, and another great light will be sent to do battle." Another great light? [typing] That's all the information we have. [Thomas] General, I spoke with Parker. T-forces are on standby, ready for combat. Good. Good. Well, Jack, what's your assessment? What are the odds of our stopping this thing? No BS. Well, if I were in Vegas and a betting man, 30-70, 40-60 at best. Do you have to be that honest? But then again, we're not exactly in Vegas, are we? We're going to win, George, one way or the other. [soldier 1] It's on the run again, sir. [soldier 2] Coordinates locked, tracking on radar. Romiski, advise Alpha of current coordinates. I want T-forces in the air. Lord help us. [soldier] Load it up, men. [console beeping] All right, men. I want you to know that the fate of all mankind rests on our shoulders. Your family, your friends, your country. The whole world. I want you sharp and proud out there. Remember, you're Rangers. You were born for this day. Any questions? What is it, Lewis? I'm sorry, sir. I request to be removed from this operation. I don't think I can handle it, sir. What? You're a trained soldier, damn it. What do you mean you can't handle it? I'm afraid, sir. Afraid? What's your responsibility, soldier? Hellraiser, sir. Who else is qualified to handle the hellraiser? I'll volunteer, sir. Well, that's not your area of expertise, O'Neil. I studied the design. I know the logistics, sir. That's a negative, Lieutenant. I'm requesting this post, sir. Besides, I don't think you have any other choice, sir. Gear up, Lieutenant. General. -Any progress, Doctor? -Yes, General. We've decoded the disc and we were right. Yonggary was sent by the alien craft to destroy the entire planet. General, we got it back. And apparently, it's stationary and hovering again. Current coordinates? Longitude: 45, 18, 7. Latitude: 33, 22, 6, sir. General, it's the Gleason plant. What kind of plant? Nuclear power plant, Doctor. That's it. Nuclear power. Radiation. It'll destroy every living thing. [electricity crackling] [roars] Base to Special T. We've made contact. Redirect to following coordinates. [pilot] Roger, Control. I copy your redirect. [snarling] Target has been located. Ten seconds to drop. Jokemaster, you are green to go. Move to two! On my mark! -Go! -[all] Yeah! [snarls] Compared to this guy, Godzilla is a pussy. Orville and Wilson, take the left flank. Dell and Rudy, take the right. Grisham and Beluse, circle from behind. O'Neil, you and that hellraiser stay with me. Move out! [roars] Bull's-eye! -[groaning] -Grisham! [screams] [roars] General, this is the daemon, the device the aliens are using to control Yonggary with. It's a receptor embedded in his forehead. Has it been analyzed? Broken down? You'd have to ask Mills that. That information has been classified. Jackson, get Mills in here! General, if we can get those T-forces within range... They could knock out the device. -Is that true, Doctor? -[Hughes] That's logical, yes. I've got Parker on the line, sir. Listen carefully, Parker. Aim for the diamond shape on the creature's forehead. O'Neil, fire at the diamond! Now! [roaring] [growling] They have discovered the secret of daemon. Unfortunate. Dematerialize Yonggary. [snarls] [roars] General, it just dropped off radar again. [sighs] Well, that proves the theory, General. It disappeared when they aimed at the daemon. What do you know about this? I've never seen it before. I've had enough of you, Mills. Listen, you start talking, or I swear you're going to wish you were never born onto God's green Earth. -Okay. Okay! -So talk! We ran an analysis. It was inconclusive. Aside from basic hydrogen molecules, it's a non-carbon molecular structure unlike anything we've ever seen. That's all I know, I swear. That doesn't solve the problem, General. We still need a way to track it. -Right. -The craft is tracking it by an energy beam. That beam should generate heat, right, Doctor? Yes, that's true. Then infrared will pick it up. Contact Parker, tell him to switch to infrared. Yes, sir. Alpha! Alpha! This is Base. Redirect. Switch to infrared. Copy? Switch to infrared tracking. Over. Scour the area for target. [beeping] I've got a reading. He's heading 36 degrees northeast. Roger, Alpha Company. Copy that report. Well, we've just received word. It's reversed direction, headed back to the city. Jack, deploy every available fighter you have to that area. -Right. -Sir, it's the President. Thank you. Hello, sir. This is General Murdock. No, sir, we haven't stopped it yet. Yes, sir. I understand. You'll have our full support. I guess good news is out of the question? The President has given the command. The bomber's been deployed. [ticking] [beeping] [man] Beta 1, proceed to runway 1-5. [pilot] Roger, Control. Request clearance. [man] Beta 1, you are number one. Clear for takeoff, heading 2-2-5. Clear to climb. Maintain 10,000 feet. [pilot] Beta 1 is airborne. [base commander] Alpha 1, this is Command Base. -Come in, Alpha 1. -This is Alpha 1, over. Mr. Baker? It's Mills. Yeah, the president just gave the order. They're going to destroy it. Right. They'll destroy the monster, the craft comes down to Earth, and we get our aliens. Target in sight. [growling] [people screaming] [roars] The diamond! Shoot for the diamond! [roars] Captain, come in! Captain! Look out! [screaming] What, your mama didn't give you enough attention when you were a tadpole? Take a bit out of this, Dino! [screams] [groans] O'Neil, pull back! It's too dangerous! Mr. Monster! I'd like you to meet my little friend. Barbecue this, bucko! [roars] Damn you! O'Neil! [screaming] What the hell are you doing? O'Neil! [roaring] He's still standing. You've just worn out your welcome. It's time you were returned... to history. [yells] [Yonggary snarling] What the...? Come on! Fight! [gunfire] He's 20 stories high. He's a monster. [indistinct murmuring] [indistinct chatter] Eagle 1 to flight, drop down to the deck and prepare to engage target. I'm locked on target. This is our last chance, Eagles. This is Alpha 1. Abort mission. Target's in sight. I've got good tone. Fox two. Are you crazy? Terminate mission! Let's blow that thing to kingdom come. Missiles away. [people screaming] [man] We're gonna die! [Holly] Yonggary just saved those people. He's on our side, General. You must call off this attack. General, you've got to destroy it. It's a killer, plain and simple. Why are you so interested all of a sudden? What's in it for you? I know I've made some mistakes. I'm just trying to make amends. Yeah, I bet you are. Jack, put your jets on standby. Don, get me the president. Eagle 1, Eagle 1, this is Command Base. Stand down until further ordered. Repeat, stand down. To you copy? Acknowledge. Roger, Control. Acknowledge stand-down. Flight, form up on me. Too close for comfort. That's right, Mr. President. We have the creature under control. I'd like more time to evaluate the situation. The daemon is lost. We must not be defeated. No, but we can no longer control Yonggary. Correct, therefore we must implement the final plan. Activate Cycor. [explosion] General, another beam just appeared on radar. [snarls] [glass shatters] Hello? Mr. President? Damn! I lost communication. Smitty, what the hell's going on? I don't know. We're being jammed. Well, get us back up! All systems are down. [beeping] Is it coming from the craft? [Smitty] No, it's local. Wait. This should help. Bravo 2 to Base. Target is down. Target is down. Do you read? Bravo 2 to Base. [rumbling] It's emitting from this room. [warbling sounds] It's coming from... there. Mills. I should have known. [rumbling] [wheezing] [snarls] Okay, Mills, give it up. Nobody's calling this off, General. I want that creature dead. Why do you want it dead? Stay back, Howell. This thing is locked. I smash it, you never get your screens back. We're just trying to save lives here. [all screaming] [snarling] Okay, looks like we have a standoff, Mills. What do you want? The code. I want out of here. This guy's a fruitcake. You know I can't let you out of here with that device. The clock's ticking, General. I swear, I'll smash it to bits. -He's bluffing. -I can't take the chance. I give you the code numbers, you give me the device. You got my word on it. I'm out of here, and we all take our chances. He's lying, General. You can't fall for that. I have no choice. Okay, the code numbers are... 7-4-5... [explosion] [snarls] [creature screeching] [roars] Give it to me. Give it to me. Nice doing business with you, gentlemen. Hey, where are you going? Got it! Come on. Come here. Get up here. Come on, you little freak. -Take him away, Sergeant Archie. -My pleasure, sir. General, we're back online. We got contact. Damn. This place is turning into a freaking prehistoric petting zoo. [screeches] -[monitor beeping] -[typing] Coordinates locked. Target on radar. General, it's in the city. [screeching] [roars] [footsteps crashing] Damn. We're hooked in, General. What in heaven is that thing? If that thing were any meaner, I'd swear it was my wife. [screeches] Come on! [Holly] This was not in the code, Doctor. Yes. Yes, it was. Remember the hieroglyphics. "Another great light would appear to do battle." [growls] [snarling] [roars] [footsteps crashing] Come on, do something! [screeches] [groans] [screams] [roars] Hey! Hey! Over here, you oversized crab cake! [roaring] Oh, man, can't a guy get a break around here? Damn it! [roars] [gasps] [shrieks] [roaring] Get up, Yonggary! Fight, man! Fight! [Murdock] Lord help us. [roars] [electricity crackling] [Holly] We've come too far. This can't happen now. Have faith, Holly. [electricity crackling] [wailing] [screeches] [wailing] [shrieks] -Yeah! -Yes! We won! [laughing] We won. [roaring] The damn thing's back. Man, this is totally insane. [indistinct chatter] Won't the damn thing die already? [roars] [roars] Is it over? Sanchez, status? No movement, General. We have a kill. Yes, Holly, it's all over. [sighs] It's not over yet. [ticking] The Bomber's on radar, five miles from target. We've got to contact that pilot. -Do it! -We're patching in. [pilot] Beta 1 to Control. Beta 1 to Control. Target is acquired. Beta 1's a click from drop point and closing fast. Beta 1, Beta 1, come in. [pilot] Beta 1 to Control. Have received and confirmed drop codes. Initializing bomb run. Beta 1! [pilot] Status is hot. Opening bomb bay doors. -Give the order! -Beta 1, this is Command Base. Transmitting abort code. -[static crackling] -[voice cutting out] Control, you are breaking up. Repeat transmission. Rendezvous in T-minus nine, eight, seven... Repeat: Tango, Delta, Omega! Abort! ...three, two, one... Jack...? Mission aborted, General. [sighs] [pilot] Roger, Control. Tango, Delta, Omega. Recall code received. Mission aborted. -[all cheer] -Yeah! We did it! -Good job, Romiski. -We did it. Tracking movement from the craft, General. Yonggary has terminated Cycor's life force. We have lost. Correct, Yonggary has allowed mankind to defeat us. No, Earth will be defeated when we return. We must escape before Yonggary discovers his true strength. Acknowledge. I am activating mega-god. Stand by. Three, two, one... It's gone, sir. It just shot off radar at light speed. Ha! Ran them out of the galaxy. Kicked their mother-- We get the idea, Boom-Boom. [laughs] Thanks for all your help. The entire world appreciates everything that you've done. Thank you, General, but Yonggary should be given the credit. He's the one that turned it around, saved us all. You did darn good, Holly. Thank you, sir. Look. [Hughes] Where are they taking him? [man] To a big deserted island. Thought he'd need some space to adapt to the 21st Century. After all, Yonggary hasn't seen this place for... what, 200 million years? [roars]
