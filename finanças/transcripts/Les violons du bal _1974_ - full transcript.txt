You know, no-one's interested in this stuff any more. Why don't you write a novel instead? You could get the Goncourt prize... The movie's not going to be a success. But if you want to make a film set in the past, shoot this one: you'll make millions! The last word from Proust: "Madeleine, Go for Broke!" Who would you like to do it with? - Well...with you! - No, I mean the actors... Well, with some unknowns....maybe my wife. My son, in any event. A kid as a hero? No, that's not a good idea. Audiences don't like watching kids. At least, not other people's ones. - What do we load ? - Colour. Okay, it's Sunday! - Are you crazy? It's Wednesday! - No, Sunday. OK, that's fine. Great, that's it. Your set is awful... Let me fix it....I'll put... So, how am I framing this? ....the grandfather ...frame this....microphone... - No: shoot the picture. - OK. - Action. - Rolling... David, what are we doing here? Well... - What are we doing? - An interview. - An interview, or some screen tests? - Tests, but right now you're interviewing. - But why, what for? - Because maybe I'll do "Violins at the Ball". - Which character ? - Michel. You. You know... And who is that? Tell me. Well, the main character. The hero. If the test is bad, if you're a bad actor, what then? Well, I don't know...You won't have me in the movie. - OK. But will you be upset about it? - No, but I hope I'll be in the movie. I won't be an actor when I grow up. - No? - No. Really. Anyway, that's a fact. I'm not going to be an actor. - You're maybe a bit too little. - You think so? I mean, young. You say this after four years, and I'll probably be the right age. How old are you ? I'm 42. And you want to shoot a movie set in 1939? - Yes. - But you're 34 years late, my friend! The past is over! The past is dead, buried! - Are you ready? - Yes. - You start with the subway station "Calvaire"... - OK, that's fine. Shooting... ...pan... - Good morning, madam. - Gentlemen. - Could we ask you a question? -Why? Did I win a contest? No, madam, you only won my sympathy. - Do you live in the neighbourhood? - Yes, I live in this building. - Ah yes. For very long? - Oh, yes, a long time. I didn't win anything...That's too bad...too bad... She's perfect! Cut! - Are you mad? Why do you want this old biddy? - You'll understand later. Come on, my wife is waiting for us. - Marie-Jose! -Ah, there you are! Hello, darling. How are you ? Hello.... - Not too tired? -It's OK, I had a break. - Will you be all right? - I'm tired, but I'll be fine. - Stage fright? - Yes, I hate this. Come on, you'll be all right, you'll see. - And I'm the one doing the show. - But I'm the one who gets dizzy. Dont' worry. See you later. Come here, let's go to the bleachers. - You want to shoot her performance? - Bravo! This might sound like a dumb question, but what's this got to do with the movie? - Nothing. - And what about that old woman? Her, yes. I've been dreaming of this movie forever. I was born just in front of this place... When I think she complains about not being filmed... - Hello. - Hello madam. - Can I help you? - I've come about the flat. Really? Please come in. Did an estate agency send you? No, some friends told me about the flat and I just wanted to have a look at it. All right, let me show you around. Please come in. There's the dining room... The whole place is 83 square meters. - That's weird... -What's weird about it? - Well, nothing... -The three windows let you see the boulevard... From here, you can see the Winter Circus... Is this a partition? Yes, that's right. Actually this large flat was separated....Awful. - And here is a room... - I know, yes. - You know? -Yes, I've been here before. Ladies and gentlemen, please give your attention to Mr Paul Raynaud, Chairman. In the last 15 days, I've made two speeches. Each time to announce bad news. On May 21st, I said to the Senate "The Germans are in Amiens". On the 28th, I said "The king of Belgium has betrayed us". The road from Dunkerque is opened. And now, these are procedures from Captain Kafoulis - our father - in case of evacuation. Get this off, it's horrible. First: we should give the key to the caretaker. The apartment should be closed up, but leave the windows open a bit for airing. Come here, Nathalie. These are my instructions in case of evacuation. PS: - Mum! - Yes, sweetheart, soon... PS: of course, all instructions are private and must remain confidential. "...the spirit of the nation was revealed to itself: worthy of our forefathers." "The second goal was to break the moral of Paris". "Last monday, Hitler organized a massive air raid upon the capital city." - Mum, do you love me ? - Yes, sweetheart. "...a hundred fighter planes. What were the targets?" "Doesn't matter, because HE knows, and we know, that..." The picture. Your grandfather's picture. Be careful... My dear husband. Twenty years of happiness. - I've got it, grandma. - Just be careful. What's wrong, sweetheart? Don't be so sad. Come on, Nathalie will make you some brunch. - You're graduating? - Yes. What about you? I have already, last year. Why are you lying? See you... Doesn't matter any more, now... Please, miss... - And you lived there until? - 1940. - I keep thinking about it. -About what? - My childhood. - And what did you find out about your childhood? - It's mine! - So what? Have you finished the script? It seems old fashioned, nobody wants to hear about this stuff.. Make your own home movie, one to show your family. Bastard! Maybe you've got wealth issues, but some people live their own lives. Never! Wars are always like this. 1870, 1914... Always the same. You let the enemy come in, then...SLAM! The trapdoor closes. In 1914, I had a pink dress. I can see it even now. It was a princess dress, with some religious stones in the back. You'll never change! I'll tell you something: you may be afraid, - But nothing will happen. - Mama, not in front of the kids. And who is going to play your character? - Well, me! - Ridiculous, ridiculous! No star: no movie. I'm going to do it. Excuse me. Hello ? And what's the title of your movie? Hello? "Violins at the Ball". Please hold on. "Violins at the Ball." "Violins at the ball"? Nice, but not commerical... Why not something more upbeat, with "love" in it, for example? Hello? Yes, absolutely my dear...It's not a problem to get back to this... - How many days you can give me? - Twelve, plus VAT. OK then, that's fine: camera! - What do we do? - Here are my keys, you go my place. - Which one is it? - The little one. The rent isn't paid, there's no phone But the key works! - And what do I do? - You film, sir! Arms behind your backs, hands crossed! Come on! Forward. - Hey, you aren't a Jew, by any chance? - What? - Jew, I said. - Jew? Come on, hurry up! - Ah, I was worried! - Worried? Why? I saw that he wasn't in bed. Why did you take him? I was alone, I felt like some father-son time... I didn't even have time to change... I got a ride over. Circus people are so strange... You train months and months for a one minute routine... You're crazy to do that show. What about you? What's on your mind? You're going to play the mother's role... You'd better hurry up...10 years ago, I was supposed to play the daughter. Soon I'll be able to play the grandmother... - You're too young to play grandmother's role. - Thank you! Anyway, I see my grandma older than she actually was. On the other hand, I see my mother younger. It's true, I'm not just saying that to convince you. That's funny, I see myself wearing a sailor suit, but I don't even know if I ever had one. I'm quite sure I never had a sailor suit. - I'm going to shoot in two days. - You found some money? I left grandpa's painting at the pawnshop. - What else, then? - Then, we'll sell the flat. - And where will we live? - In the parking lot. We'll get a box, and live in the parking lot. I really married a nutcase! - But tell me, your mother was blonde? - That's right. His mother? What would Freud think of this? I don't like myself blonde. I'll play brunette... Mama, mama! Hello! Don't panic Leon, your mother's home! Leon yourself! Stop picking on your brother. And there's grandfather... Hello sweetheart... What's the matter with you? You look so serious... Mum, what's a Jew? - Well...well... - What, then? - I'm waiting... - All right, dear. I'll tell you. It was a long time ago before all of these things happened... There was only one religion, the Jewish one. One day, a man came and said: - "I'm God's son" - You already heard about Jesus Christ? - Yes. - Well, this was the man. It took place in Palestine. People were unhappy. So Christ, a very good man, said: "love each other, the kingdom of heaven is promised to you..." And a lot of tender and knowing things... But without understanding how, things went badly wrong. - What things? - Those who followed him became Christians. Those who didn't remained Jewish. - What about us? - We come from that background. - Then I'm a Jew? - Yes, so what? Why didn't you tell me? Because these are very old stories that we don't talk about at home. - But I've already been in a church! - And me and your grandma as well. - Can I go again one day? - Sure, but it's very clammy inside... - But I'm Jewish, that's funny! - You're just like the other boys. You've got a nose, ears, a mouth, hands...hmmm...dirty ones! My little Jew! ...and you will maybe know one day, Madam, how far a son's love can go. Aren't you beloved, maybe? What's wrong? Nothing, I scraped myself. Come and see... - Nathalie, are you Jewish? - You scared me! - Are you Jewish? -Of course, dear. You, me, we all are. Hey, you were right. I'm a Jew! Down with Jews! Down with Jews! - Tag! - You scared me, you scamp! What are you doing here? We've been looking for you for hours. - And what are you doing here ? - I wanted to say a little prayer. - But this is a church! - So what? Little darling... Nice. Very nice...but where's the sex? When are you shooting the sex scenes? Sex scene? Well, we're starting on Saturday. Saturday? That's it, we shoot it on Saturday... -Yes, Saturday... - And explosions? How many dead do you have? Well, no, they won't die... And who's going to be interested in that? You've got Jews....not much commercial value... Any Jews dead? Maybe a few... But all of them alive? Impossible! You have many, huh? You have Buchenwald, Hiroshima and Vietnam. Even Biafra! What kind of audience do you imagine is going to be interested in seeing everyone alive? My characters do not die. - No? - No, they don't die. - That makes it awkward... - Too bad. - Have you heard anything about Guido Tolcani De Oliveri? - No... Well, that's me. The cinema...I thought that... Sorry to rush you, but there's another screening. Did you know that I have no more money to continue the movie? - How much do you need? How much? - Well, quite a lot. Could we put some more drama in it? I like him... I'll take care of you, don't worry. Trust me: I promoted Mussolini... So? - That guy's a real asshole! - That's true, but he knows people. It's a shame you need so much money to narrate your own life. You need just as much to narrate anyone's life. You see, there's directors like Fellini: he doesn't tell stories any more, he simply shoots emotions. That's right, but he still needs film in the can. My turn, my turn! - What is it ? - An alert. Where are you going ? In case of alerts, we go to the high school for defence exercises. - You're not going! - I am! No! And afterwards, I'm going to the station to help refugees. Some enjoy music, meanwhile others are at war. So what? I didn't start this war. What about this chandelier? We should move it, it's in the way. The children are growing apart from me... And where is Nathalie? I know where she is, should I get her? No. You go to bed... Sorry Madam, there's nothing left. Do you know this child's family? Let me help you... I couldn't leave her like that. She'll sleep in my bed, I'll sleep with Michel. Do you agree? Of course, let her stay. Madam... You must be hungry... No thank you. If you don't mind, I'm very tired from travelling. - I'll show you your room. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good evening, madam. Excuse me... There you are. I'll sleep with my brother. You'll have my bed. I'll leave you to it. - Aren't you cold ? - No. - She's a very fine young woman. - Very. - You smoke now? - Well, from time to time. Jean, do you hear me! You've got half an hour, you'll be late! - Michel, are you still asleep? - No, I'm getting up. Jean, Jean ! - Mama, mama, mama. - Hello sweetheart... - Jean, wake up. - Mum, where's the car? We sold it a long time ago. Here's your hot milk. Where is she? Hurry up, you'll miss your class. - But where is she? - She's gone. Just like that? She didn't eat anything, just smoked a cigarette and left. - Did she say where she was going? - She said nothing. I'm not sure she knew herself... She's so beautiful... So beautiful... You don't know. I saw her naked. - When do we meet? - I'm late, they're already out. - Where are mine? - Here! Sir, can I go out ? You're winding up your classmates! Out! At the door! - Sir, can I go down and kiss my brother? - Enough! Four hours detention! You'll see, after the war, everything will be wonderful. - This is London.... But where's Jean? ...French are talking to French... Your father wrote that it's becoming very dangerous for him out here. - It's not dangerous for me? - You're much younger... You don't have the risk of being sent to Germany... ...Jean-Louis is 16. - But where are they? - Listen, you're old enough to understand. I'll tell you a important secret: Jean met your father near the Spanish border. - They're going to England to fight. - I'll get rid of the war! - But why didn't Nathalie come for dinner ? - She said she wasn't hungry... - You know something you're not saying... - Me? Why me? - She's not the same as she used to be... - Because of the war, you just said it! Nathalie, come inside! - Are you waiting for someone? - No. Not any more. Are you worried? Come on! Is that you, miss? Don't get worked up. There are so many prowlers, we need to be careful. Come here, I'll notify madam. Please, leave me alone. Stay here. What's going on? It's me, Madam. Sit down, miss. My son told me about your little affair. - While we were having dinner. - Yes, Madam. I know...I know everything. Pierre is just a child. Unfortunately, marriage is not something we can consider. - But I love him! - For sure, for sure! But it's impossible. My son has no father now, and he's young. I'm sure he's sorry about the bad things he's put you through. He's so sensible... - But he finally saw reason. - What reason? I admit it may sound cruel to you, but it's impossible for my son to marry you. I don't understand...that's his child! - I know it. - I have nothing against you. But you are Hebrew. Yes. But I never hid it, he always knew. Always! I need to go to Paris, it's my last chance. I'll explain it to you, one day. Please tell them I've gone, I'll give them some news as soon as possible. - And what if we leave as well? - Don't be afraid, we'll meet again. - Why don't you tell them? - Because they wouldn't let me go. See, it's the most beautiful plaza in the world. - Before the war, it was full of lights and laughter. - Tell me, why did Nathalie leave so fast? - Because her fiance didn't love her anymore? - Yes, something like that. - Do you think she'll meet him again? - No, I don't think so. - Will we find her again? - I hope so... I just left the demonstration, the cops messed me up a bit. Would you mind helping me get out of here? I'm not keen on being repressed. Lay down! We're out, you want to get out here? I'd rather wait until it gets dark. I can't show up like this. - I can take you to my place... - Okay, but I don't want to see anyone. Lay down, lay down! There's some water here, if you want to wash up. - Can I trust you? - You don't have much choice. - Why are you doing this? - You remind me of someone... - My hats! Where are my hats? - I've got them! I've warned all my friends. Nathalie will get in touch with them for sure, she's got no money. - What is it? - Another alert! - No, it's the timer. Michel, please turn on the light. - Yes, mum. Thinking about the fact that you don't do anything during the day... I've enrolled you in a class...a very refined class... - Will I be tracked down? - No, I enrolled you with a false name. You start next Monday. You'll be just like any other boy. We're on the seventh floor. Seven is my lucky number! Every time I buy a lottery ticket, I choose number seven. But I can't have any boy's life! I think about too many things... There are too many things on my mind... What the...! It'll surprise no one to learn that pupil Georget...has a zero! The only interesting composition, which I've saved for last because I gave it an A+, is the one from Michel Cafou. This one will be read by himself to all classrooms, I insist... ...and Michel Cafou will be honoured to help during our Saint-Charlemagne's mass. - Do you know what to do during mass? - Of course I do! - What's your name? - La Rochefoucault. - Is that your real name? - Of course it is! - Bye guys! - Bye! Come on, come on... Come on, get in! Don't wait till it goes. Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go to my place. Up here, you juniors! - Eric, is that you? - Mum, we're going to have brunch! We're going to have a party, guys! You're telling me! Where did you get chocolate? My father salvages wreckage, sells it to the huns, so we have everything. It's great! He sells English boats. We show up, we get the wrecks, and we sell them! Hello, young man... Hello, Madam. - Michel, what the hell are you doing? - I'm coming! - Melanie, Melanie! - What's wrong? She talked to me! Just now she phoned! - I recognized her voice instantly! - Who? - Nathalie... - Nathalie! We found Nathalie. - I think she's being watched. - When is she coming? She's not coming, I'll go there tomorrow. - But Mum, tomorrow is Thursday. Can I come? - Yes. Thank you, Mum! Here we come! Wait for me downstairs. - Darling... - Don't ask questions. You need to move out of the hotel, there's going to be a raid tonight, at La Muette. But where will we go? 115 Longchamp Street. At the courtyard, stairway C, 3rd floor at Mrs Leon's place. She knows. This is her phone number. I'll call you. Melanie? Everybody's fine. What about you? I have to leave for a while. I'm watched all the time. I'll call you... - OK, that's fine. - Cut! Thank you, ladies. Police! - Are you hungry? - Yes, a bit. My wife doesn't buy bread anymore, she said it makes you fat. We've all got our problems... - Bourgeoise cuisine, good, huh? - Sausages are proletarian food. You must be a superior officer's son... You know where you're going? I need to go to Lyon. There, someone will tell me where to go. - Are you going to Switzerland? - If anyone asks, tell them you don't know. It's nothing to laugh about. As I've gone through this situation myself, it makes me laugh that it can still happen, nowadays... Hello? Ah, Nathalie... Yes, dear. What about you? No, Michel is in class. And Melanie is out getting colza seeds... ...so she can make some oil. Yes, yes. They sprout in the water. Well, grease, anyway. That's the elevator, it must be her. Call me back. Police! What's the matter with you? What are you doing? You frightened me... - Do you have your papers? - Yes, here they are. Blanchet, Jeanne... That's funny, we're born on the same day, but not the same year. Please come with me. Well, what we're looking for isn't here. We can leave. The Germans are at my place! You hurt me! Who's this? Why did you say that? - Because it's true. - You'll get in trouble, little madam. And first of all, you're wrong. We're French. - You live alone here? - Yes. Present yourself at 6 o'clock, Lauriston Street. Oh, sweetheart! - What are you doing here? - I'll explain. Look who's here. - Oh, Melanie! - My darling! - Let's go home. - That's the problem, we can't. - Why not? - I brought your coat. - What's happening? - I'll tell you later. Mum, what's this? These are seals, dear. - My God... - Mum, I'm afraid... You're safe, honey. We're home. Here we are... The door is locked from the inside. This one as well... I'm going to leave you with Mr Robert, please do whatever he says. You'll see, honey, we'll meet again soon. Don't be sad. Okay, lad, if you don't want to cause me me trouble, you need to wise up, now! Sit down, we need to talk. Your time tied to your mother's apron strings is over. If anyone asks you, you're going to meet your Aunt Marie in Saint-Julien-Les-Valeries. - What's your name? - Michel...Vautan. - Your mother? - Simone Vautan... ...my father, Jean. My little sister, Ghislaine is much better now. Her lungs are fine, thanks to my father's relationship with a pharmacist, she could be cured by the best doctors. Mum will not come this year... Okay, that's very good! You can invent the rest! Invent it, but remember it. See here? You got some egg! Come on, let's have lunch! Ah....what do we have here? Yes! Eh, wait a sec! Let's not eat like this, or we're going to get a crowd in here! - What do you do for a living? - Movies. Now it's my turn to laugh. Porn or Catholic? - Hebrew, let's say. - Oh, yes? You're not anti-Semite, at least? Well, it's a day of laughs today! I know what it's like to be on the run. Some do it for an ideal, others for money. - What about you? For good intentions? - Well, I won't take you as far as Switzerland. I can give you a ride to Lyon, but not to Switzerland. Is this boy your son? - Yes, yes... -Where do you come from? - Paris. - And your destination? - Saint-Julien-Les-Valeries. - Good, good... - What's this...food? - No, no, it's nothing. Dangerous! - Come on, then. - I'm coming. - Do you know what time it is? - I know. The boy must be dying of exhaustion! Come here, my boy... Wipe your feet! OK, I'll grab something to drink... Put the bags behind the cash register. Come here, my boy, I'll show you your room. Chocolate? There's not much left apart from Easter chicks. Now, you go to bed. We'll see you tomorrow. - Could you please leave the lamp? - All right. Would you give me a kiss? You need to eat all the bread, or it means it's not good. You need to eat more! I wouldn't want my boy to look like you! Well, we take what we have. I can't say I was spoiled like this. Lucienne's here. She's your cousin. You're both the same age. Don't worry, the last time you met each other, you were both six months old. - Aunt Marie! - I'm at the oven. Well, give each other a hug! - Lucienne, are you staying with us? - Yes, mum will take us to the cemetery. The cemetery? We'll put some flowers on Grandma Vautan's grave this afternoon. - What's the matter with you? - It's my grandma's first name. Are you mad? Someone might see you. - What's your movie about? - A story I wrote a long time ago. - A bourgeoise story, I suppose - I have a bourgeoise face, huh? Yeah... You're happy with yourself, you can't deny that. - And quiet. - Quiet, quiet, not that much. - I'm not sure how to make this movie. - Is its little message so important? That little message walks all over you, junior. No need to move, it's an accident, not a roadblock. - Are you going back to Paris, after this? -No, I'll go on for some scouting. - What are you doing? - I need a minute, wait here. - You're funny. -Why's that? Boys around here don't look like you, not like Paris. When the war ends, I'll come back and take you away. Yes, believe me. Lu, I'll prove I really love you: I'm gonna tell you a huge secret. If you tell it to someone, it could be very serious. - Do you swear? - You swear first. OK, I swear.... - I'm not your cousin. - Ah, you liar! My family hides, we have fake papers, and my name isn't Vautan. - What's your real name, then? - Kafouniss at first, then Cafou. It's been two years since anybody called me that name. - Because, you know, Cafou is less... - Less what? Oh, PFF! - What a liar you are. - You promised to not tell anyone. I swear. So, lots of chocolate! We can eat lots, it's huge! Michel! Hide! - Are you alone? - Yes. - Here we are. Today's the day - What day? Moving out day. Your mother and your grandma just arrived. - They're waiting for us in Bellegarde. - Do I have to go right now? Well, yes. Get your stuff, I'll wait downstairs. - Did you hear? - I believe you, now. - Michel, hurry up! I'm getting ready! - Take this. - But I can't! - I'll just say I lost it. - But I can't, I'm a Jew! I don't care: my father is a communist... - Then? - I'm coming, I'm coming. Goodbye! BYE. UNDERTAKERS. No! It's impossible, I'm gonna choke to death! And it's too small, as well. - You're not the first, or the last. - If you can't walk, this is the alternative. What the hell are you trying to make me do? I'd rather be dead. - This is so you won't be dead. - Yes, but somehow... - And now, get me out of here! - Michel? - Michel? - Are you sad? No...Now, darling, our troubles are ending. We'll run to Switzerland. And Nathalie will join us later on. You'll see, sweetheart, we'll all be together again. No, it's clear. Then, in between the Jerries patrols, we need to reach the grove below the road. You can't see it from here. Etienne, hurry up! Follow the others. - That was close. - Come on, we've only got ten minutes... - You go along the hedge and through the field. - We'll wait for you under the trees. Charlie will get granny and take her to the hearse. Jean will show you the path. - Your name is Jean? - Yes, why? This way... Is all this your luggage? - Now, it's 4000 Francs. - But I thought that... Listen, you take it or leave it! We're in this mess as well! Okay, kid, it's your turn! What are you waiting for? - Are you afraid? - Please! Go ahead, dear. What's wrong? Are you mad, we're all gonna get caught! What's wrong with you? I can't stand it any longer ! My veins are swelling up... Go on without me, or I'm going to ruin everything. - We need to go. - Go on, I can sort it out. - No, I'm staying with you. - Mum, come, come! We'll help you walk. Take the suitcase. - My purse! - OK... - You follow me. - OK, sweetheart, move ahead. Give me your case. Hide, quick! We've lost an hour, and the meeting point is still miles away. - I'm too old for war. - No! That's enough, now. If the hearse didn't wait, we're done! Dear madam, you're beyond walking to Switzerland. Come on! Let's go! I can manage. See you later, dears. OK... Our turn, now. We need to keep on. - Be careful! - Go ahead! We can't use the trail... Be careful, look in front of you! Get up on this bank, and say if you see something. I don't see anything... - Is it far? - We need to go across this field, ...and reach the treeline, over there. - Catch up with us afterwards! - We'll give you a signal... Mama! Hurry up! The Jerries have fun shooting into the trees. - Today's a celebration for them... - A celebration...! OK, let's go. Come on! Quick! Here's the meeting point. Watch your step. - What about my mother? - She's in the hearse, you'll meet her later. I'm glad everything went well. Good-bye, madam. Go, go! Come on, move. OK, let's go. If we're downwind... But we're turning around! We were there before with Jean! Listen, madam, that's enough. If you don't give us more money, we're not taking any more risks. You've got five minutes before the next patrol. Just go along the woods, you can't miss it! - Don't be afraid, dear. - I'm not afraid, I'm with you.
