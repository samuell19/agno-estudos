I don’t know what to tell you. - Have a nice day. - Goodbye. I don't know what to tell you. I really don't know what to tell you. Yes... Whatever you want. Yes, whatever you want. Let’s do that. You are always saying you are dying of something you don’t even know you have. Even the doctor is telling you so. I’ll call you back. Goodbye. - Hi, how are you? - Good. It’s hundred and ten. Do you want hot-sauce? Yes. - Do you have change? - Of how much? Five hundred. No. I don't have change. Let me see if I can get change from a neighbour. When I called I asked you to bring change for a five hundred bill. It’s all I have. They didn’t tell me anything. If you want I’ll change it at the convenience store. Okay, but don’t take long, I have to go out. Gabino. Paco. Paco, call me as soon as you can. Hello. Hello, I’m Luisa. I know who you are. Why do you act like you don’t know me? Where do I know you from? Gafas’ party last year. Don’t you remember? No, I don’t remember. I don’t think it was me. By the end of the night we were all in one room. Everyone took off their shoes and sat on a bed. You are taking me for someone else. It wasn’t me. It was you. That afternoon we saw each other again. It was by accident, of course. You took me to your friends’ house. They spoke of something I knew nothing about. I was looking at you. Your way of speaking seemed false. It struck me that none of these people knew who you were. Only I knew who you were. You avoided my gaze. You clearly did it on purpose. To make you look at me I said something, suddenly joining the conversation with an absurd remark. Everyone turned to look at me. I can’t remember what I said. It was you who answered me, Again I had the feeling no one understood what you said. To break the silence, someone asked about the music we were listening to. I didn’t have to speak anymore. You asked never to see me again. Of course, we met again. It’s truly incredible. I think we’d met before. There’s nothing we can do now. Don’t worry too much about what people think. The weather was awful for several months. We couldn’t go out. One night you went to my bedroom. I was by myself. I asked you to leave me alone. You were like a shadow waiting for me to approach. One afternoon we saw each other again. It was by accident, of course. I took you to the place of friends of mine. You got drunk right away. You spoke to everyone and none understood a word you said. I felt pity and was embarrassed. Months later we saw each other again. I met you by accident in the grocery’s line. You were staring at a gossip magazine. I greeted you and you got scared. I assume you were embarrassed. - How are you? - Good, how are you? Good. We had nothing to talk about. We didn’t speak for a couple of minutes. The line didn’t move. The cashier had a problem, and was unable to work the machine. I was going to change lanes, but I didn’t want to lose the opportunity to talk to you. I was planning on inviting you to the movies. Suddenly you turned around. But I didn’t dare invite you anywhere. You asked me to move so that you could change lanes. I followed you, and I lined up behind you again. -Why don’t you use the express lane? I turned to look at my basket. I had a beer and a bag of chips. -It’ll be just a second. I don’t know how we ended up at your friend’s party. When we arrived you didn’t introduce me. I assumed you couldn’t remember my name. Soon after I lost track of you. The house was bigger than what it looked from the outside, and I spend a while looking for you. When I finnaly mannaged to find you in the crowd, I didn't dare coming close to you. I spend the rest of the party a couple feet away from you, staring at you. You realized immediately, but you didn’t acknowledge me. People began to leave and the situation became uncomfortable. You approached me and asked me never to see you again. Of course, we met again. I can still hear your voice. I was scared, you were looking at me. I try to resist. You took my picture. I asked you to give me a year thinking perhaps to test you, or to forget all about you. I can still hear your voice. I was scared, you were looking at me. I try to resist. You took my picture. I asked you to give me a year to forget about you, or perhaps to test you. I can still hear your voice. I was scared, you were looking at me. I try to resist. You took my picture. I asked you to give me a year thinking perhaps to test you, or to forget all about you. I don't know who gave you my address. One night you went to my house. I was alone. I asked you to come in out of politeness. -Do you want a glass of water? -Yes, please. You followed me to the kitchen, you leaned against the cupboard and just stood there saying nothing. I gave you the glass. I didn’t help myself to anything and stared at you. I asked you to leave me alone. Here you go. Thanks. - We're good? - Yes. Can you do me a favor? Can I charge my cellphone just for a minute? It won’t be long, right? Less than two hours. Come on! It'll just be a minute. Were you resting? Are you exhausted of relaxing too much? Like my grandmother used to say. Where is that charger? I don’t have power at home. It’s been a while. I charge it wherever I can. What did you think of the stuff I brought you last time? It was alright. That's the same stuff. I also have crack, if you want. No. I’m also selling movies, do you want to take a look? No, thanks. You watch them in the computer. I don’t have a computer. A classic with Maria Felix. This one is good. Have you seen it? No. It’s about a guy that jumps of a thirty story building. He is a stuntman. But his daughter is his promoter and she doesn't know what she's doing, so he gets thrown into crazy things… He jumps of a thirty story building. Hello. Luis. Gabino. What's up? Not much. Alright, that’s that. So, you don’t want the movies? No, dude. I’ll keep selling them, patiently. Give me a minute. Let it just charge a little longer. It was completely dead. Get out of here, please. Just a minute. I’m just grabbing my phone. Thanks Paco. How are you? I'm good. …last year at the sculpture garden. Don’t you remember? All the sculptures where covered with plastic. There was a group of european tourists. You were leaning against a sculpture. I came from behind you, I wanted to ask you something. You didn’t see me coming. -No, it wasn’t me. -Don’t you remember? You asked me about the sculptures and I said I knew nothing about them, that it was a pity they were covered. It started to rain and the tourists ran to their bus. We took refuge under a plastic that was left from a street market. It wasn’t me. You are taking me for someone else.
