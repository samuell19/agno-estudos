"Well, it's no secret to anyone, that the readiness of Tbilisi residents to please the guest, multiplied by Caucasian uninhibited fantasy, can sometimes reach to such unthinkable limits, that even an eyewitness will doubt But was it really. Anyway, something like to what you will see now really happened, they say. Nina Vasilievna, why are you so worried? What are you, what are you? What is the concern here? Help yourself. Allow. Givi from Yerevan then arrived so enthusiastic. Truth? Jemal, he did this to me in Yerevan, I'll tell you - you'll go crazy. - Givi. - What? Jemalu does not speak. We agreed - this is our secret. I am silent. - Allow me? - Please. Ermand, dear, you will not be offended, if I take care of your daughter? Please. And by the way, I know what they're talking about. Yes?

And this, Aunt Nina, at your new house in Saburtalo. Right. - Do you like it there? - Yes. But Givi will not part with this grandfather's house. - Nina Vasilievna... Old photographs, and those do not give. Oh, in Old Tiflis, visitors were rolled on a raft. - Givi. - What? That's how much I look at the photo your grandfather and his friends... Where can you get a raft now? Jemal, if you knew what did he do to me in Yerevan... Tomorrow there will be a raft. "Above the Tbilisi narrow street The firmament is supported only by songs. If in songs you remain an ignoramus, I'm sorry, I have nothing to talk about with you." Jemal, if you knew what he did to me in Yerevan. It's not funny anymore. Either tell us or hide away from this secret of yours. For the week that I was on a business trip in Armenia, where they just did not take me - to you Sevan, to Kachmeadin, then get out, he says, Ararat for you. Here is a museum, there are artists, restaurants, monuments. I don't know yet what. But in Yerevan, Jemal, in Yerevan he is... Good. Imagine Imagine we are at the Yerevan railway station.

What is this? - Raft. - What raft? Have you ever asked me that raft, where is it from? Fence. Our raft? "And it really was. The whole city knows about it. And I must tell you that no one It didn't really surprise me." What a beautiful city we have. You are still a freak. I would at least tell him would make a person happy. What should I have said? How is that? Dismantled grandfather's house, made a raft out of it, and shouldn't have said so? You know what, Jemal, don't tell anyone about this. Let this be our secret. Listen, when are your Bulgarians coming? After three days. And what? Let's go faster. Let's start dismantling my mother's new house, otherwise we may not be in time for their arrival, build a ship. Well, how's the night? Made me scream until the morning. But did you sleep? No, she didn't let me sleep. The bad guy got mad. And you? It's been very naughty lately. Why did you drink a whole glass of wine yesterday? First, half a glass. And then, if you didn't drink and I wouldn't.

People usually don't swim here. Help him! He can't swim - he'll drown! Well, get him! - Thank you. - Lena! Lena, help me, he will drown me. Quicker! Uncle, honey, calm down. We won't let you drown. Do not be afraid. Now we'll put you in a boat and swim back to shore. Here we go. A little bit more. Tired. I haven't swum in such a long time. - Well, uncle? - What kind of uncle am I? What, I look so bad? Disgraced! We have disgraced Georgia. "Captain, captain, smile..." You're good, you know how to swim. Rudder right! - Are these your friends? - Not. Tell them something. Talk to girls. Uncomfortable. Tell them something. Good weather. Is not it? I want to express my gratitude for the salvation of my soul and flesh, but I don't know your name. - My name is Lena. - And me - Lena. How it is? Well, she is Lena - big, and I'm Lena - little. - Who did I hug? - With a small one. Excuse me for hitting you. This is how it is supposed to be when you rescue drowning people. Well, apart from saving the drowning, what else are you doing? - We are on the fourth "Archaeology". - Yes? Last year were in practice in Georgia, and now we are going to Armenia. We have practice from the first number, so we carved a few days to swim. And we are builders. We accept here one large object. In general, on a business trip. - For a long time? - Some more days. My friend wanted to ask won't the charming saviors agree to start attend the memorial table at two in the afternoon in a restaurant? We do not go to a restaurant with strangers! We don't even know your name. The one who can't swim - Dada - David Konstantinovich. And I'm Georgy Nikolaevich! Very nice. Here we have arrived. See you! Don't splash, get me wet. Are we following them? "See you later" they said. Are they not? In this form, and they may not recognize us. Maybe run for towels and a sombrero? Don't forget chess. Hello!

"Dear Mary, due to unforeseen circumstances The trip was extended by three days. We will be on the 28th. Kiss the children. your date". What else to write? I think it's ok. What are you pulling? Write "Tina" instead of "Mary" and that's it. I can't stand lies. Well, what have we done? For yesterday, I, as if for 20 years rejuvenated, such pleasure received. My children will never think how I want to be sometimes among young people on an equal footing. They are very good girls. No, I mean, no matter how they think something bad about us. Tell me, just honestly, like a man, if not for them, could you save me? To be honest, we would both drown. This is for you from me. Thank you. Thank you. Lena, tell me. Well, Lena. No I can not. Oops! That's all. In my opinion, Moscow - Yerevan is worth 10 minutes drive to Tbilisi. We will meet you on the 30th. Well, my children, do not be naughty and beware of Georgian men. Especially older men. Lena, will you give me flowers? Oh, please forgive me. - It is for you. - Thanks. - Well, what are you? This is thanks to you. - Thanks. Thank you very much, thank you.

Plays with fire. You just put him on his feet, my Ternike. I'll give him a rustle later. How are you, George? Liver. Very worried? What about the liver... The wife does not speak. And how are you?

Lena! Lena, who rested in Gagra! Big and small! Where are you, Lena! This is us! This is us! I'm little Lena, and this is a big one! This is us. Girls, what a pity that you are leaving. - Stay. - You might as well stay, huh? I am Mary - the wife of David Konstantinovich. And this is Tina. Tina, where are you? And this is Tina - George's wife. These are her children - Leah and Nana. And these are mine - Jaba and Manana. There in a bag of khachapuri and a jar of satsivi. Salt is wrapped in paper.
