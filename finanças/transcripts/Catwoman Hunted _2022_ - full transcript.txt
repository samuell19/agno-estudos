[opening theme music playing] [engine accelerating] [indistinct chatter] Your keys, sir. Have a good evening. [indistinct chatter] All clear, sir. Thank you, Number One. [scoffs] Well, well, what have we here? Keep her close. I won't be staying long. Si, senorita. It's a very good Catwoman costume, my dear, if a trifle dated. What can I say? I have an appreciation for the classics. As do I, my dear. As do I. It's invitation only, sir. [snaps fingers] [Black Mask] I believe that covers my entire entourage. Yes, sir. Please enjoy the masquerade, sir. [laughter and indistinct chatter] Sionis. [all gasping] [Black Mask] Stand down, gentlemen. Tobias Whale here works for our hostess. Excuse me. I must pay my respects. Find me later. Oh, count on it. Allow me to introduce you to the leader of Leviathan, Lady Barbara Minerva. Lady Barbara, this is Roman Sionis, known in Gotham City as Black Mask. It's an honor to finally meet the big boss in person. [scoffs] I don't see myself as any kind of boss. Leviathan is more of a cooperative organization. We help each other. That's exactly what impressed me, and I am not easily impressed. [Minerva] Neither am I, I'm afraid. I trust you have your entrance fee. Right here. I assume you can secure it until we're ready to depart. I can. [saxophone music playing] [indistinct chatter] [gasps] Darling, I love your costume. Oof, hold on to that one, love, or I might just steal him away. Did you purchase that diamond or just seduce it onto your finger? Oof, hold on to that one, love, or I might just steal her away. Excuse me. This little kitty needs to powder her nose. [vault whirring] There. Now let's return to the party. Oh, I heard about Sochi. Most unfortunate. It was a promising operation. Mm-hmm. I will only say this once. Sochi was a minor setback. These things happen sometimes. The point, of course, is that our operation is large enough to absorb such losses. Don't let it concern you. [Isis meowing] - [alarm buzzing] - Oh, come on. [sighs] It's that darn cat again. I told you to catch him. You ever tried catching a cat on a hot tiled roof? This is like the 80th time he's set off the motion sensors. The boss is gonna to kill us if the alarm disturbs her guests. Just shut it off. Shut it off! [man 1] Yeah, yeah, we don't need the motion sensors. We still got the cameras. - [man 2] Exactly! - [Isis meowing] You know, I appreciate the classics, but I move with the times. [camera whirring] [beeping] Hmm. Cameras are so much easier to fool than motion sensors. You get picked for the out of town trip? Nah. You? [scoffs] I wish. One night's work and four nights enjoying wherever. Would have been sweet, you know? [man 2] Yeah. Sucks being a Grade 3. We never get the soft gigs. [clicking] [vault opening] [whirring] A lady always accessorizes with care. [rock 'n' roll music playing] [gasps] The cat's eye emerald! [gasps] Darling, you're even more gorgeous in person. Yes! Purr-fect match. I'm smiling, too. [clanking] [gasps] [alarm blaring] I am no longer smiling. Not smiling at all. [grunts] That perfect crime went south awfully fast. Remind me to lay a few choice words on the bat the next time I see him. - Open fire! - [gun fires] [effort grunts] Get her! [door slams opens] [crowd exclaiming] What the bloody hell is... [effort grunts] Stop her! All of you! - Now! - [yelling] Now! [grunting] All right. No need to get excited. I thought this was supposed to be a party. Ooh, my kind of party. Out of the way, you idiots. Excuse me. [man squeals] [grunts] [woman] Hey, take this, you... [grunts] [gunshots] [all screaming] [gunshots] [grunts] Here, try the caviar. [woman] What the hell is that? [gunshots] [Catwoman] Is this your guy? Hold on tight or I might just steal him away. [gunshots] Ah, I love your pearls. Might just steal those away too. [woman screaming] I don't believe we've been properly introduced. The name's Selina Kyle, but please, call me Catwoman. Move! Aw, thanks for keeping her close. Eh, senorita, your key! [meowing] [Catwoman] Isis, play. Cat's Eye, meet cat's paw. - [meowing] - [valet] Your key, senorita! - You give her the key, you die. - Si, senor. It's okay. I have a spare. - [gasping] - [engine starting] [Whale] Don't just stand there, get her! - [engine accelerating] - Lovely party. Hate to steal and run. [engine revving] - The keys, damn it. - Si, senor. Mount up! Take all of them. - You, drive. - Yes, Sir. Move, all of you! She's not getting away. [engine starting] [tires screeching] [Isis meowing] Good girl. Don't want to lose that little pretty. It would kind of defeat the whole purpose of the evening. [tires screeching] Speed up. Trying not to drive off the cliff. Speed up or I'll throw you off the cliff. - Yes, Sir. - [engine accelerating] [playful jazz music playing] Why aren't you firing? Because we don't want her damn car flying off the damn cliff with the damn emerald! Oh, yeah, right. Idiot. Go, do it! [smirks] Clearly, this fool's never had a date in his life or he'd know a woman can lay a man low with a single swish of her hips. [tires screeching] [screams] Pull over, or we'll make you pull over! Oh, sorry. Can't. I'm being chased by some truly horrible people. And if I pull over, they might catch me. [grunts] Pincer! [scoffs] Did you just tell him to pinch me? That's really inappropriate, young man. Not "pinch her." "Pincer." Pincer! Oh, well, that's very different. Never mind. Just do it! [tires screeching] [grunts] [meows] I know. That was almost worse than a pinch. Again. Hold her this time. [screaming] [gasps] [tires screeching] Now, let's see if we can lose those unwanted suitors. [gunshot] Now I can shoot. [gunshot] [tires screeching] Cut her off. - Get ready. - For what? For your shot! Oh, yeah. Right. - I said get up! - [grunting] [screams] Okay. Now you pull over, or you die. Is that an order? That's exactly what it is. [screams] You see, the thing is, I don't do well with orders. [meows] Oh, sorry, baby. Mommy will fix it. [grunting] [screams, grunts] There, doors are locked and no one else is getting in. [meows] [Catwoman] Yes, I know. We're in a convertible. Ugh. It was a symbolic gesture. I swear, Isis, for a cat, you are so literal-minded. [gasps] [gunshots] [man 1 grunts] Come on! Get the doors open! [man 2] They're stuck! The street widens up ahead. Pull alongside. Roger that, boss. [grunts] Honey, you should really watch where you're going. [Whale screams] [grunts] [growls] [exhales] Boss? Boss? A little help? Please? There, you see? I told you we'd get away clean. Yeah, you never doubted it for a moment, right? [gasps] - [meows] - [groans] Oh, great. Congratulations, Selina. You just became Leviathan's number one target. [grunts] [Whale grunts] Mm. [chuckles] Mm-hmm. It is the real thing. And I'm supposed to thank you for recovering it? I put it in your hands, in your vault. I thought Leviathan had better security than this. [Minerva] I'm not the one who escorted her into the party. Hmm. [clears throat] Uh, apologies. I suppose mistakes were made on all sides and in the end, no harm done. Oh, harm was done. This little kitten has sauntered into the lair of the wrong big cat. Such an affront must not stand. And I promise you, Selina Kyle will not go unpunished. [meows] Oh, Isis, stop! Mama's trying to sleep. [Batwoman] Mama should be trying to stay out of prison. [groans] [grunts] Ugh. Ugh, if I'd have known it was you, I wouldn't have hit the brakes. Please. You knew it was me. I see my cat. I don't see my cat's eye emerald. Nope, I left that behind for Whale to find. Wait. That batarang... Here it comes. That was you. Almost there. You screwed up my extremely well-planned heist on purpose? See? I knew you'd put it together. [scoffs] Wow. Seriously, you are such a little do-gooder, you won't even let a harmless sneak thief steal from gangsters? You're not harmless. And Barbara Minerva is no mere gangster. Really? Well, do tell. Come on. Enlighten me. Ugh, no, thanks. I know you're just stalling for time, trying to figure out your little escape plan. No, no. I can see escape isn't in my near future since we're aboard a private jet. A jet flying east, if I'm not mistaken. Mm, very good. Introductions. Selina Kyle, meet Interpol agents Julia Pennyworth and King Faraday. We're already acquainted. Unfortunately. Oh, Julia. King. Is that any way to talk to an old friend? Selina, we're not friends. I'm a police officer. You're a thief. Oh, and you're clearly corrupt because the last time I checked, civil servants didn't rate luxury accommodations like these. [moans] We confiscated the jet from the Penguin. Oh, that explains it. For a flightless bird, Oswald always did love the high life. So, other than east, where exactly are we headed? [Julia] We don't know yet. Can't you just, uh, ask the pilot? We're tracking Black Mask and Minerva. Thanks to a liquid tracker I sprayed on the emerald in Gotham prior to Black Mask acquiring it. Oh, so that's why you thought it was essential that the Cat's Eye stay with its current owners. [Julia] Minerva is stepping up. She's built her Leviathan Crime Syndicate on narcotics, blackmail, human trafficking, etcetera. It's now richer than many countries. [slurps] Mm. Penguin does know his bubbly. I am glad it suits your tastes. And what suits yours, King? As if I don't already know. Well, what would suit me is, uh, [clears throat] Interpol taking Leviathan apart while I slap cuffs on Lady Barbara Minerva. So do it. Not just yet. Tracking Minerva and Mask will lead us to a meeting of the entire criminal cartel that Black Mask is currently trying to join using the eye as his entrance fee. Which has exactly what to do with me? Multiple countries have multiple warrants out for your arrest. I always was popular. You have been on quite the global tear lately. You would think jewel thievery had an expiration date. Why the sudden rush? You're usually much lazier than that. [sighs] Languid, not lazy. I can take action when properly motivated. As luck would have it, we'd like to offer you motivation. Oh, I'm listening. You help us bust Minerva, Black Mask and the rest of Leviathan, and we make all those warrants disappear. Okay. And if I pass on said generous offer? Incarceration. We're talking about your freedom, Selina. If you cooperate. Cooperate how? By making yourself a target. [Minerva] The line's secure. You've been apprised of the circumstances? Good. Then I believe you'll agree an example must be made. Catwoman must die, so let me know if you need me to provide resources. [Talia] Not necessary. I never cared for that feline. And I have just the right woman for the job. Shanghai? [Julia] Mm, you know your airstrips. In my line of work, it pays to. [Julia] The Cat's Eye landed here. Meaning Minerva's plane landed here. [Faraday] Exactly. [mechanical whirring] Pennyworth and I will track Minerva and Mask to the exact location of the cartel meet. - You'll keep an eye on our guest? - Of course. [sighs] Better make it two eyes. I'm famously slippery, especially when wet. Excuse me? I'm going to take a bath. Ooh. A bubble bath. Good luck with that one. [Batwoman] Yeah, thanks. [mechanical whirring] [Selina] Just us girls left, huh? Oh. Nice and hot. - Want to test it? - Yeah, I'll trust you on that. Pretty much only on that. No. Such a suspicious mind. Now, we'll just give the bubbles a little time to work their [inhales] scented magic. Meanwhile... There's a question that I have been dying to ask you. Whenever I wear a wig, [sighs] I get so hot. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love role-playing. It's a disguise, not role-play. But on those steamy, sultry Gotham nights, I bet you can't wait to... [whispering] take it off. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. I think the bubbles are probably ready now. [Batwoman grunts softly] And it's such a large tub. [gasps softly] I suppose it wouldn't do any harm if we... Oh, sorry, Katie. Cats bathe themselves. Of course, you're more than welcome to watch. If that's how you get your kicks. No, damn it, I... I'll be in the cockpit, monitoring Faraday and Pennyworth's progress. But don't think for a moment you can escape this plane. No, wouldn't dream of it. [grunts angrily] Gotta love Bat family tech. Waterproof and bubble-proof. [line ringing] Holly, it's me. Yeah. Well, let's just say I borrowed the phone while the owner's attention was elsewhere. I know, I know, I know, but the job's taking just a little bit longer than we planned. How's Anya? What about the other girls? Okay, understood. But don't worry, Isis and I will see all of you very soon with enough scratch, so they never have to be afraid again. I promise. [Minerva] Ladies and gentlemen of Leviathan, allow me to introduce prospective member, Roman Sionis, known as Black Mask. The reason why he is here is because his control of the Eastern Seaboard cartel in the States should make an important addition to our control of the global underworld. And he brought the price of admission. All in favor of confirming his candidacy? [all] Aye. [Minerva] Opposed? Oh, look at that. Unanimously confirmed. Welcome to Leviathan, Roman. [Black Mask] I am truly honored to join this venerable assembly. - I assume you know everyone. - Only by reputation. Forgive me. Then I'm being rude. This is Oyabun Noguri, known of Mr. Yakuza. Head of the Japanese cartel. An honor. The honor is mine, Noguri-Sama. Dr. Tzin Zhao Tzin, head of the Chinese cartel. - Doctor. - Mr. Mask. At the appropriate time, I'd love to pick your brain. About? [chuckles] I'm sure we'll think of something. Also over here, let me introduce you to Amparo Cardenas, known as La Dama. Head of the Central American cartel. Charmed. [chuckles] Your mask fascinates me, Senor Sionis. It seems at first an affectation, a nod to the so-called mystery men who attempt to plague us. But, I suppose, we all wear masks of a sort. [Black Mask] Indeed. I have simply chosen not to hide mine. I understand. I believe you and I will enjoy the fruits of our shared hemisphere, Roman. I look forward to sharing. [clears throat] And I believe you know Moxie Mannheim. [Black Mask] Sure. [Moxie] Yeah. Now, now, boys. Leviathan is one big happy family. Old conflicts must stay in the past. You all have your prescribed roles, your prescribed arenas and territories. Black Mask runs the Eastern Seaboard. Boss Moxie heads Intergang, Leviathan's interstellar arms dealer. I trust you can both play nice? - Yeah. - Sure. Speaking of territories, what of our attempt to, uh, colonize Southern Russia? Yes, our failure in Sochi has given each of us... - Pause? - Precisely. Sochi was a setback, certainly, but I believe I can quickly allay any concerns. [Batwoman] Holding pattern established. We could get the call at any minute. I assume you're ready for action. Aw, Katie, dear, this kitten's always ready for action. All right, Selina, enough with the faux sexual tension. Honey, there's nothing faux about it. Come on, Cat. [angrily] Don't call me Cat. Wait. I can call you Selina, but I can't call you Cat? Which is, in case you hadn't noticed, short for Catwoman. - Only he calls me Cat. - Oh. [Julia on speaker] JP One to Flight One. This is Flight One. Do you have the location? [Julia] Roger that. KF One just needs time to get his ducks in a row. We don't want any of the cartel leaders to escape our dragnet. We need a distraction to keep the bad guys busy and on site. Sending coordinates. Okay, distraction. You're up. Uh, yeah. I am up. About 1,000 feet up. When do we land? We're not landing. There isn't time. Do you see wings on this feline? Cats don't fly. We had a deal. No, you had a deal. I was being blackmailed. Deal, extortion. Let's not get caught up in semantics. [Faraday on speaker] Approaching drop. Jump here, or jump into a prison cell for 20 years to life. Ugh, fine. Here. This will help us keep in touch. Oh, joy. Try these instead. I think you'll like "em. [Faraday] Drop in ten. Drop in five, four, three, two, one, drop. Flight One to JP One. The Cat's away. - [Julia] Any problems? - Uh, she balked a little. - Only a little? - Yeah, I know. Suspicious. Ha! So maybe cats can fly. No wonder Superman's such a happy guy. Flying kinda rocks. [Batwoman] Deploy chute, Selina, before you find out Just how poorly rocks fly. No! Killjoy. I've been called worse. [Catwoman whooping, laughing] [Batwoman] All right, I'm very glad you're having fun. Press the button on the side of the goggles. I could do that, but now that I'm out of the plane, what makes you think I'm not going to bail on this whole endeavor? Well, I have your cat. Pressing button. Oh, wow! You were right. I like the goggles. Target acquired? Target acquired. [grunts] - You good? - [scoffs] Please! A cat always... Yeah, yeah, lands on her feet. I've heard the saying. Don't you ever get tired of all that cat schtick? Oh, seriously? Do you really want to get into a schtick war, Batwoman? [chuckles] I didn't think so. [Cheshire] Here, kitty, Kitty. Now, what's a nice feline like you doing in a place like this? I could ask you the same question, Cheshire. [Cheshire] Uh-uh. I asked first. I'm a jewel thief. I came here to steal the jewel. [Cheshire] And I am a League of Shadows assassin. I came here to kill the jewel thief. You came here to try. [Cheshire] Catfight? Catfight. [both grunting] [Cheshire grunts] - [Cheshire grunts] - Oh, come on! Not the face. That's my moneymaker, or one of them. [Cheshire] Not for long. Jellyfish toxin. Yeah. You used that on me last time. Since then, I made sure to build up an immunity. [Cheshire sighs] I have got to find some new toxins. Mm, I don't know, Chesh. Poison doesn't really fit the whole cat motif. [Cheshire] I'm expanding the trope! [grunts] [Cheshire grunts] - [Catwoman grunts] - [Cheshire yells] - [Catwoman groans] - [Cheshire grunts] - [Cheshire yells] - [Catwoman groans] - [Catwoman groans in pain] - Nighty-night, Kitty. [Cheshire grunts] [both] Batwoman? [Catwoman] Why are you here? [Batwoman sighs] It's not by choice. Your cat was going berserk on the plane. You know, she's small, but she is a monster. [Catwoman] Yeah, Isis is way too dignified for berserk. [Cheshire] I think she's here as your back-up. Oh, is that true? Are you my back-up? [sighs] Maybe. In any case, it's two against one. [Isis meows] Three against one. [Isis meows] Okay, two against one. [Cheshire] Am I supposed to be impressed? I mean, it's not called the League of Shadows for nothing. [snarling] Uh, who is that? I am Nosferata. I'm new. You've got your bat, I've got mine. - She's not my bat! - I'm not her bat. Then I guess you belong to me. - [Nosferata grunts] - [Batwoman groans] [Cheshire yells] What do you call a bat without wings? What is this? Are you The Riddler? You call her roadkill. [snarls viciously] Hey! What the... I don't have wings, but yours will do. Yeah, we'll see about that. [both grunting] Well, they seem to be getting along. Well, sure. Those bats like to pretend they're loners, but there's a whole cave full of them back in Gotham. I hear you would know. [chuckles] We're not discussing that. [Cheshire grunts] Oh, touchy subject? Listen, you grinning idiot. You really don't want to make me mad. [Cheshire grunts, groans] - [Nosferata grunts] - [Batwoman groans] [Nosferata grunts triumphantly] [grunts angrily] - [explosion] - [Nosferata yelps] [Batwoman grunts angrily] [both grunting] [Black Mask] What was that? Retribution, perhaps. [grunts] [grunting, straining] - [Cheshire grunts] - [Catwoman] Uh-oh. [Nosferata screams] [Batwoman straining] [Catwoman grunts] [straining] Let go. You're too heavy. Uh, rude. Still, it never hurts to lose the extra weight. - Don't [grunts] do [grunts]... - Aw, we're halfway down already. [Cheshire screams] [Cheshire screams] [grunts wearily] Still too heavy. [Nosferata straining] Still so rude. Hey, we're going to need something to break our fall. - [Nosferata straining] - Oh, what about her? That'll work. [straining] [grunts] - [Catwoman grunts] - [Nosferata] No! You're gonna get us all killed. I'm sure we'll be fine. And you'll only be badly injured. [screams in terror] [screaming, gasping wearily] [all grunting in pain] - [Catwoman] Ow! - [Batwoman] Yeah. [man clears throat] Uh-oh, again. [sighs angrily] What now? See that? We took out your two assassins, so you big-talking, behind-the-scenes desk jockeys might want to run. It seems to me the marble floor took out my assassins. And we have resources of our own. [Black Mask] None of us got here by accident. [Catwoman scoffs] Speak for yourself. I just fell through a skylight. [Black Mask] Kill them both. - [guns cocking] - Uh, we should... Way ahead of you. [man grunting] I meant move away from the guys with guns, not toward them. Not my style. Okay, fine, but if you die, do I still get my deal? Mm, I'm gonna say nope. [man straining] [Black Mask] Will you shoot her already? But, boss, Number One's in the way. [man grunts] [yelps, thuds] There. Now he's out of the way. - [guns cocking] - [man gasps] [men grunting] Shoot those two broads already. [Catwoman grunts] [chuckles] Yes. These should do for a start. [glass shatters] [demons bellowing] [chanting in Latin] [demon bellowing] Abaddon serve La Dama. Morax serve La Dama. And La Dama appreciates your service, mis niños. [man grunts] [Batwoman grunts] [all snarling] I did not sign up for this. Did you sign up for this? - Uh... - You really have to think about that? I definitely did not sign up for this. See? Even he knows. - [Catwoman grunts] - [man groans] [snarling, bellowing] [all grunting] [all grunting] [man screaming] [yells] [Catwoman grunts] [gasps] Out of the way. Listen to me, gaijin. You face Oyabun Noguri, Mr. Yakuza, trained in the art of the katana by sensei who studied with the great Lady Shiva. Prepare to die. Mm, yeah, that is something. The only problem is, you face Selina Kyle, the Catwoman, trained in the art of the katana by the great Lady Shiva herself. - Oh, crap. - Exactly. Prepare to get your ass kicked. [Mr. Yakuza grunts] - [Mr. Yakuza groans] - [Whale] Enough! [grunts angrily] [Catwoman grunts] [bellowing] - [grunts] - [shrieks] - [Whale grunts] - [whimpering, straining] [demon snarling] [shots firing] [explosion] [Morax bellows] [La Dama] Niños, kill her already. You demons must earn your keep. Niños, protect your mistr... [muffled screams] [snarling] Abaddon not understand. What's La Dama say? Morax not sure. She's saying your service is complete. [muffled screams] Now she's saying you should go home. [muffled speaking] Abaddon obey La Dama. Morax obey La Dama. [muffled screaming] That's the problem with demons. The major ones are too hard to control, and the minor ones, [sighs] they are dumb as bricks. [muffled speaking, shrieking] [thudding] [Catwoman straining, grunting] - That all you got? - No. - [grunts] - [groans] [groans loudly] This is where it pays to be flexible. - [grunts] - [groans loudly] [screams] BW-1 to JP-1. ETA? [Julia] Um, is the distraction working? Are the bosses still there? [snarling] Yes and yes. ETA? [Julia] Perfect, BW-1. Was worried the bosses might have gotten ailurophobia. - What? - You know, fear of cats. Didn't want distraction lo scare them off. Mm. Yeah. No worries there. ETA? It took KF-1 a tad longer than we'd hoped to get his ducks in a row. Julia. Damn it. ETA? Now. Just... ETA, now. [man] Let's go, let's go! [Faraday] Ducks all in a row here. [screaming] [man] Open fire! [grunts] [beeps] [groans, screams] Hey, boss. I can't move! Well, I got my own problems. Yeah, you better hide, you lousy cop. [groans] Actually, I'm quite an impressive cop, as you would certainly know if you were still conscious. [screaming] Damn. Just let me out of this tin can, I'll show you what a real crackdown looks like. [grunts] Let me out! It seems we need a little more help. [Julia] Touch a single test tube and you're toast, Tzin. - Hands in the air, Doctor. - [sighs] Disappointing development. Hmm. Learn to cope. [groans] [grunts] Oh, come on, Whale. Seriously? [grunts] I'm... gonna... kill you! Don't make me fight dirty. [groans] [whimpers] Timber. Huh. One whale beached. [indistinct radio chatter] [siren wattling] [Batwoman] Nice work. [Catwoman] Yeah, but has anyone seen Lady Minerva? - Oh, now you're here. - [meows] I believe we had a deal. I thought you said it was extortion. No, no, now. Let's not get caught up in semantics. Minerva's still out there. [scoffs] No, I was just the distraction. Cordoning off the place was your job, King. All right. You did your part, Selina. You're free to go. All charges and warrants will be dropped. It's a clean slate. So, stay out of trouble. - [teases] - [meows] Oh, don't you start. So, since the job's over, can I have the emerald back now? [all] No. [police siren wailing] [sighs] Not exactly the cat's eye. - But this pretty will do for now. - [meows] Right. Every little bit helps Anya and the other girls. Now, if I could just get Leviathan to quit sending League of Shadows assassins to kill us. Well, well. You know, Isis, Cheshire's sword really has come in handy. We must remember to thank her next time we see her. Assuming she's not still trying to murder us. Oh, come on. Overkill much? I mean, there are like 100 of you here. Fifty-two. Bat-computer in my cowl counts 52 ninja on this tower. Oh, darn, I was only prepared for 51. Can you handle the extra? Please, I'm so getting more than you. [ninjas grunts] One, two. So why you here? Three. - [groans] - One. I had a feeling this wasn't over. Two. Minerva's not known for forgiveness. Three. [Catwoman] Four. Oh, why won't you just admit? Five! Six! That you find me irresistible. Irresistible? Come on. Four. Why won't you just admit... Five. But personalities aside... Six. ...I have a responsibility... Seven. ...to make sure you survive. Eight. Oh. At least I have a personality. Seven, eight. Nine. Ten. You're falling behind. - [Catwoman] Eleven. - [grunts] - [Batwoman] Nine, ten. - [ninjas scream] [Batwoman] Eleven. Twelve, 13, 14. You'll never beat me at this rate. - Fifteen. - [groans] - Twelve. - [groans] Thirteen. - Fourteen. - [groans] Fifteen. [meows] - [screams] - [both] He's mine! [both grunting] - [grunts] - [both] Sixteen. [Catwoman] Ah, final count. Batwoman: 25. Catwoman: 27. I win. Oh, come on. Seriously? Isis took out two of yours, so, technically, it's a tie. - My cat, my count. - [meows] [helicopter hovering] I don't want to say I told you so, but I believe I told you 52 would not be enough. My friend, they simply do not make ninja like they used to. Deliver the package. [grunting] You clearly cheated. Just because you don't have a cat of your own to help fight. [both grunting] [low growl] Solomon Grundy. - Born on a Monday. - [feet thumping] - Oh, come on. - [meows] Christened on Tuesday. Married on Wednesday. [meows] Wow. That's one fair-weather cat. Meaning she's smarter than we are? Yeah, pretty much. Died on Saturday. Buried on Sunday. And that was the end of Solomon Grundy. [groans] - Born on a Monday. - [gasps] - Christened on Tuesday. - [grunts] Married on Wednesday. Oh, sorry, Sol. You got the wrong bride. [grunts] [grunts] [groans] Died on Saturday. Buried on Sunday. And that was the end of Solomon Grundy. If only. Come on, Sol baby. I'm the one they sent you to pulverize. Follow me. Solomon Grundy. Born on a Monday. Yes, that's it. That's it. Right this way. There you go. Christened on Tuesday. Died on Saturday. Uh. Look... I promised a certain someone that I wouldn't Kill or not be the direct cause of death anyway. But the truly special thing about you is... you never permanently kick the bucket. Solomon Grundy. - Born on a Monday. - Yeah, exactly. Come Monday, you'll just regenerate. So, when it comes to my promise... ...all bets are off. Married on Wednesday. Oh. You're getting married? Congratulations. Here. Have a cigar. Took ill on... Or have a dozen. That's all, folks. [grunting] [sighs] [coughs] You know what they say. [coughs] The bigger they are... etcetera. [sighs] If you want something done right, etcetera, etcetera. Careful. That kitty has claws. [hisses] So does this one. [groans] [screams] Okay. Did not know you could do that. [Cheetah] Yes. It came as quite a shock to Wonder Woman as well. But neither of you should have been surprised. I rose to lead Leviathan by serving the Gods of both my parents. My father's God was always money, of course. My mother's God was Urzkartaga. Becoming the cheetah is Urzkartaga's answer to my prayers. [nervously] Uh, right. I have a similar deal with, um... Bastet, Egyptian Goddess. Turns me into a literal Catwoman all the time. Yeah. How do you think I got the name? You were a cat burglar who started wearing a mask with cute little kitten ears. Yeah. They are pretty cute, aren't they? Listen, that transformation of yours seemed really painful. And, honestly, I'm pretty exhausted just from watching it. How about we put this off until, oh, I don't know... Bastille Day? Bastille Day work for you? My schedule is clear now. Oh! Cat fight? Big cat fight. [gasps] - [grunts, yells] - [screeching] [yells] [groans] [snarls] - [grunts] - [snarls] [groans] [groans] [grunts] [screams] [grunts] Huh? [whimpering] [low growl] [growls] [Cheetah grunts] [Catwoman panting] [Cheetah yells] [groans] [elevator bell dings] [snarling] [evil laugh] [grunts] [growls] [grunts] [growls] [grunts, screams] Oh, by the way, your little problem in Sochi, that was me. You're welcome. [growls] [grunts, screams] [low growl] [grunts] [thuds] Selina. [groans] Nice catch, Bat. No problem. [thunder rumbling] [groans] Well, I suppose a Leviathan will need a new proxy. If Talia Al Ghul is to continue leading from the shadows. But I must say, this gives me yet another reason to hate Selina Kyle. As if I hadn't enough reasons already. [man] Inhibitor collar set. [Batwoman] Hey, hold up. Got to put a collar on Grundy. How? The guy's got no neck. Well, it's over. Leviathan and its cartels have been decimated. - And now their leader... - [Catwoman scoffs] Please. You don't really think Cheetah was the true leader of Leviathan, do you? [groans] Hold still. [Catwoman] You're enjoying this. Less than you think. - [under breath] But more than I should. - Hold on. If Minerva wasn't Leviathan's leader, who is? Um... I don't know. Maybe someone with international resources who's been trained from birth to rule the underworld? - Harley Quinn. - [groans] I'm out of here. All right, Selina, you can go. And, hey, thank you. Turns out it was our lucky break you stole that emerald. Luck? [scoffs] You believe this was all dumb luck? What makes you think this wasn't my plan all along? [chuckles] Yeah, right. Since when does Catwoman care about taking down criminals? Minerva was trafficking human beings, young girls. [Isis meows] Batwoman. Faraday. The safe in Penguin's plane... It's empty. The cat's eye emerald is gone. How did she... I have no idea. [Julia] Um, where's Catwoman? [Catwoman laughs] Luck, my perfect ass. Mad skills, baby. Planning and mad skills. [clicks tongue] Isis. You shouldn't wander off like that. Or do you want to be quarantined for months after we make landfall? [cell phone rings] Hi, Holly. How's Anya? Well, don't worry. We have all the money we need to get Anya the help she'll need. Help for Anya, and help for all the women and girls Leviathan was trafficking in Sochi. Back to Gotham? Soon. Soon. I just have to make a quick stop in London. There are a few things I need to pick up, you know, at the Tower. [Japanese song playing]
