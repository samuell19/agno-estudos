[sound of a train in distance] [sound of water trickling] Partner, we have a flight to catch to America tonight. Do you think you'll be done by then? [Bell rings] I'm proud to say I am his first coach Jitender is representing India in Commonwealth games It's a matter of pride for me and this club Jitender, would you like to say something? I learned all my basics from this very Rocky Boxing club. Not just me many other youngsters are getting into to boxing because of this club [Phone rings] -Excuse me. -Ok. Cut Cut Cut Rakeshji, Is it true that this club was started by a fan of the Rocky movie? Yes! Our founder Shiv Shastriji is going to USA today. This farewell program is being organized in his honor Actually, it's a very good story. But I will have to take Rajat Sir's approval to cover him So please get the approval, Shastriji will be really happy. In fact, he is a big fan of Rajat Sir -Please -I'll try [Celebratory music] Oh wow, a music band! Jitender you are here too! I didn't know all of you will be here today Congratulations, you won the championship All thanks to your blessings Sir. Very good Here's a small gift for you from all of us This is small? This is such a big gift You guys sometimes! This has all been done by the students. I'm just here to help out. Thank you thank you -Thank you very much. -And another surprise for you Rajesh, can you give the phone to Rajat sir -Ok. What's your name again? -Shiv Shankar Shastri Tell Sir, Shiv Shastri is on the line Sir, it's Joyeeta's call, Shiv Shastriji is on the line Look at the time. Rajat Sharma ji! I'm a huge fan of you Sir. I have watched every episodes of Aap Ki Adalat. Multiple times even! Can you check the audio please. 1-2 1-2 audio. Good? But why would you want to do an interview with a commoner like me? A person's work is what makes him big or small. You have taught people to dream big and have changed the notion of being a commoner And your boxing ring has given our country big stalwarts like Jitender and Vijender So it's only fair for the country to know about someone like you Ahem, what would you be asking me Sir? Can you help me prep please? So the questions would be how did you inspire players How did you reach this level of success How did you make a boxing ring, the pathway to fulfill your dreams It's my first interview so I am a little nervous You have nothing to be worried about Shastriji. When your boxers don't fear anyone in the ring, why would you be any less? People love real life stories like yours. Get inspired by it And your story with the Rocky movie angle is a whole chapter in itself -It's awesome! -Ok. Ok. Btw, they tell me you are going to America? Yes sir, my son lives in Ohio. So now my retired life will be spent in America itself now Oh, wow. Great! So now you'll be in Rocky's country. Why don't you send me a video of you on the Rocky steps once you reach there? Just like in the Rocky movie, running! And we can use that shot when we show your interview Btw, where are these Rocky steps? In Philadelphia? Yes yes, in Philadelphia So I'll send you the video of me on the Rocky steps. No, no I am ready now Yeah, I am ready. Ok Shastriji, safe flight. I'll tell my son about the video as soon as I get there -Bye. -Bye. Bye. Bye. [Rustling inside the box] Sir, right in front of the camera.

These are not ordinary boxing gloves They are Rocky gloves; from the film Rocky. -These are very rare -Who is Rocky? Oh, I got it, it's the Schwarzenegger movie. Right? No... not Schwarzenegger It is not about how hard you hit It is about how hard you get it and still keep moving forward. Silvester Stallone from Rocky Balboa You guys don't know Rocky?! What kinda Americans are you? Rahul hasn't shown you Rocky? Hey you guys! You guys are still up?! You have school tomorrow right? uniforms. OK? and grandpa will be tired too -Ya we are just about to sleep -OK Good night Good night mom. Grandpa, tell us about the Rocky movie? Rocky is not a film... it's an epic According to me, there are only 3 epics Ramayan, Mahabharat. Have you heard about it? and third is Rocky Why do you like Rocky so much? Yeah. Why do you like Rocky so much? It's literally just a movie. Why do I like Rocky so much? Why do I like Rocky so much? Sometimes a movie comes along that changes your life! When your grandmother passed away... I mean... I know. I know When your grandmother passed away your father Rahul was 7 years old, maybe he was Advaith's age She used to be sick. She used to feel tired. But I didn't have the the time to notice it I was so busy with work. But by the time we took her to hospital I realized that she is very sick After few days, she passed away. She died. Her death shook me it broke me. I blamed myself for that I felt guilty Slowly I stopped going to work I used to just eat and sleep Over-eating made me obese And after one year I had my first heart attack. When I was lying down in the hospital bed Rocky movie was playing on the T.V I watched that movie and heard its music my life changed! I have never seen an inspirational film ever in my life! I started watching it again and then again then I identified with Rocky Balboa you see?! [car passing by] Even now when I hear music from Rocky movie I feel like jumping out of my bed and start doing push up So how come you didn't want dad to be a boxer? I wanted him to be a boxer. But he was so scared of boxing he would even wear a boxer made by Jockey. Yeah... Dad would have been a terrible boxer. So think! if there was no Rocky I wouldn't have sent Rahul to America. If he didn't come to America he wouldn't have met your mother and if he had not met your mother. We would not have happened! That was a good story grandpa -Good Night -Good Night Good Night I can't believe you haven't shown your kids Rocky Papa this is different generation. They don't know about Rocky. What is Rocky to do with generation? Rocky is a philosophy This... How far is Philadelphia from here? Philadelphia? 12-15 hours by road Whenever I call India, they ask about the video Their episode is ready, they just need the video Which video? Rahul, the video of me running up the stairs in Philadelphia I remind you every week and you're asking me what video? Papa, to go to Philadelphia and spend time it will take 10 days And you know its Alka and I am studying for M.S and Arjun is going to 10th and you are worried about Rocky Honestly Papa, at this point that is our last priority Papa You are bored that is why you keep thinking of all this Why don't you keep yourself active a little Do one thing, from now Advaith is your responsibility Dropping and picking him up from the school bus stop and his homework you take care of it. that will help me and Alka and you will be active as well And that Philadelphia trip, we will plan it well and go in summer. -OK? -Yes.

No my life is different Let me tell you what Americans do They work hard when young, so they can retire well They will tell their kids - You live your life and we will live ours.

A lifetime gets lost for a middle-class man daydreaming and slowly we forget our dreams and our children's aspirations become our dream I feel I have not accomplished any of my life aspirations or dreams. Everything was left unfinished Now, I won't let it happen I want to climb the Philadelphia Rocky steps and want to experience the joy of accomplishing a dream of mine. And I want to help you get back to your granddaughter and have the gratification that I did something right. Do you have pictures of your granddaughter? Yes. This is 5 years old. She would have grown big now. She is cute. But who drew this mustache on her face?! Oh, that is a long story. We have the whole night. Tell me the story. What is her name?

Let it go. Wherever you go in the world people are the same. Ones who want to work other idiots who won't let them work. But Cinnamonji, this is America everyone has a gun here and they are trigger-happy Uncle ji, we are Ajay Devgan fans, we are not scared of these American shot guns Move. -Hands up! -Hey Cinnamon- ji, put it down. It's real but it is locked. -Don't be scared Hold? Be brave, After all you are Rocky Balboa Yes. Steady! [montage song] You were sleeping hard, so I took Casper for walk Cheers! Rahul, son I know you are worried but Cinnamon has promised me he will get me the charger today Now I have met new people and made friends You don't worry about me get the hell out our town, foreigner Insert the magazine, hold your hands like this just load -Nothing happened -well that... The wind is going to the left. That is why -Grandpa is on Instagram? -Eh? What? Advaith, come on we are getting late. hurry, hurry and don't forget your water bottle Rahul. Hi. We met at the parent-teacher meeting. Yeah. Manjari and Advaith goes to same school My name is Sanjeev. I live down the street. We are pretty much neighbors I see This is picture of our maid Elsa she has been missing for last few days My daughter says your dad and Elsa used to talk often at bus stop Maybe he knows something about it Can I please talk to him? Actually papa left to India few days back -He is not really here. Sorry about that. -Okay. OK? Good luck with this. We are getting late Oh, sure... Thank you for your time. Come. Sanju, how many days ago did Elsa go missing? it has been about a week now. Right That is right. We called her house in India. She didn't go there also That is even worse. There is no problem with her going to India. Do you guys even realize how serious is this? Hm? To confiscate a maid's passport and to make her work without a break that too without giving minimum wages. It is a federal crime What can we do now? Luckily she hasn't gone to the cops otherwise they would have been here by now We should find her before she talks to someone But how do we find her, she could be anywhere How about this that we put a police case on her saying that she stole some jewelry of mine or something like that There is no point and once the cops figure out that nothing has been stolen, it can come back to bite us, Unless you have something discriminating that can pin her down Sanjeev, how about that video? How old was Maya when this happened? She was 11 - 12 This is good. This is really good. This is definitely domestic abuse, that too of a minor A non-bailable offence If we put this out... no matter where she hides in the US, the cops would find her. -Don't hold my legs, hold the chair -OK Excuse me Listen son, I know I might not do this job in India but after coming here to America, I realized no job is of lower or higher stature. Stop it, dad! At least have you thought about your health Yes. Health is an issue. To work for 14 hours, sleeping in the air bag. yes, it's an issue But health is less about physical labor and more about mental state. I have learned so much here. So much I was alive before now I have started to live my life Ok good that you have started living your life What should I tell Alka? That my old dad all of a sudden, without telling anyone leaves the house. That too with a stranger woman. And the carnivals, Instagram profile - seriously Papa I mean do you realize you are a retired man? I am retire from work, not from my life. And according to me what is retirement? Re - tiring It means changing the tires of your life and get on a new road of life And Rocky has said Going in for one more round when you don't think you can, makes all the difference in your life Papa, Rocky? again? you do realize right? It's a movie, It's make-believe. Sometimes you need a little make believe to believe in ourselves Son, my phone is working now You can call me anytime And about Alka and kids, tell them that your dad has lived his entire life for you But for a few days he wants to live for himself I believe they will understand and if they don't. they will get it when they are my age.

Cinnamon, it's important that I meet Elsa. -Please. -Let me try. Thank you! You have five minutes. Yes. Thank you. Please get me out of here Shastra-ji I have only done one crime. I took care of my family. I looked after them. I thought of them as my own. Trust me Shastraji, I have not done anything wrong. I had promised you that I will put you on that flight to India. I will definitely do it They have only given us a little time. Cinnamon was talking about some video tape What about it? Remember I told you once Maya drew a mustache on my grand daughter's photo. [Elsa] You did it, right? [Elsa] Why did you do it? I only had one picture of my Isabelle. You didn't get anything else?! Tell me. Sorry I am sorry. It happened 2-5 years ago.

You have been charged with abuse of a minor How do you plea? Your honor, the state recommends that she be denied a bail as she is a flight risk You are denied bail. You will be placed in a county facility, until a month's time. Did you talk to a lawyer? Yeah. But the lawyers are all expensive. We won't be able to afford them. So what can we do? In such cases, government assigns a lawyer who will represent you. -Will they be good? -It's 50-50 chance. But ya, one good news. -aunty ji's passport. How are you? Now I am in jail too. jail in USA Don't know where all my life will take me. I only have one grief next Friday is my grand daughter's birthday. I don't if I will get out of here.

[On phone] Who's this? I have to give grand mother's message to Isabelle [Phone] But who are you? I am her friend-Shiv Shastri [Phone] Tell her to go back to work immediately [Phone] They are nice people. What is she [Phone] going to do coming back here? She needs a family, everybody needs one [Phone] If she is that worried about us, [Phone] ask her to send us money. Hello! Hello! So listen, grab the backup line backer for Minnesota... crap I cant remember his name. Na... I'm blanking. It'll come to me. Look, I gotta go. I got somebody here. Yeah... how can I help you? I am here for the case of Elsa. -Elsa? -It's a case about child abuse, sir. child abuse. This is a tough case. There is so much you can do when there is strong evidence. Actually... sir...I was doing a research and I got those papers with me Scott Hendricks that is the guy I was telling you about. Yeah, just grab him dude. Really. Capsule, there is no point starving. If anything pray for Elsa, that girl gives a statement in Elsa's favor. Everything depends on that. If she tells the judge, that it is Elsa who abused her - it is all over. She can be imprisoned for 6 years. Maya, don't worry about anything. you just have to recognize her. rest, uncle will take care. OK? That is exactly what she is going to do. right? Maya? What the heck? Maya. Last 8 years, Elsa has been living with you. away from her family away from her granddaughter This picture was her only solace I am not saying you drew on it intentionally but she lost her temper Maya we are part of generation that feels that what can't be taught by a lecture, can always be taught with a slap. I'm not saying what she did was right. But she apologized, didn't she? You are a... grown-up girl Maya. A responsible girl, I hope. You know that, depending on your statement Elsa might spend her life in jail or with her granddaughter. I don't know if it was my lecture or the muscles of the bikers. But Maya refused to identify Elsa. Maya's parents decided to settle the case outside the court. Through the settlement, Elsa got $100, 000 Thus, Elsa got her freedom. And as promised to my biker friends, I got my first tattoo. [crowd cheers] [Take a picture] Hmm... nice. Hey...everyone. first off, I wana say "thank you" all for comin. Mr.Shastri and Elsa are headed home. I just wanna say we so happy that you stopped in our town. And we got to know, two beautiful souls And Elsa, if I ever find that thief that stole your purse. I am gonna give him a hug and I am gonna thank him. Cheers! Make it fast, fatso [Shastri] Back home, Arjun rejected my advice and did the right use of the Rocky gloves. you have to be kidding me! Remember my grandpa?! those are his friends and if you don't stop messing with me I will ask him to bring his friends and properly introduce you guys!

Shastra ji. you did so much for me I am indebted to you. I don't know how to thank you enough. Just by calling my name right! Shastri ji... Shast-ri ji. Thank you Shastri ji I should be one saying Thank you. Do you know when I used to be at Rahul's home... sitting alone, I used to look out the window to see a bird that used to sit on a branch of a tree It used to fly for hours in the sky, whole day but in the evening he will come back to the same tree branch.
