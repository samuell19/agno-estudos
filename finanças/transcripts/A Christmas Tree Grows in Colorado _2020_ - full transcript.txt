oh, another candle. Hmm. Here you go, dad. Ah. Well, there you go, baby. All right. Great secret Santa, everybody. Now, time to get back to town business. Why don't we hear from our director of community development, Erin chambers? Thank you, dad. I mean, "mr. Mayor." so, as everyone knows, last year, two of our biggest factories closed down, which meant we had to reassess our entire economic model. During this process, one thing became perfectly clear to me. Brooklynites love Christmas and, each year, we go all out to celebrate. So I believe that if we promote Brooklyn as a top holiday destination, we will be able to attract visitors who want to share in what we all know makes our town so special. And those visitors will become customers and participants in our many themed activities. As usual, we'll be hosting our favorite events... gingerbread contests, caroling, decorating, and visits with Santa. And... As the pièce de résistance, this year's celebration will culminate in a massive tree lighting in the town square on the 23rd. And with the right press coverage, we can cement Brooklyn as the place for Christmas in all of Colorado. So I hope you'll all join me in spreading the word to ensure that we have the best attendance ever. Thanks! Oh! And one last thing. I wanted to make sure you've met our new treasurer... Neil Stephens. Ah, hey, everyone. Um, I just want to say I look forward to working with you all. And for what it's worth, based on the numbers, creating a viable tourism industry is going to be vital to this the town's future and long-term success. Also, I am also happy to report that Steven, our dedicated intern, has already sourced a 40-foot tree for... nope. It's no good. Oh, no. What's wrong with it? Root disease. Which, frankly, is all the better for me, my dear. I mean, how was I supposed to decorate that giant thing all on my own? I'm so sorry, mayor chambers. I had no idea. Well, that's okay, Steven. I'm sure you can find a suitable replacement in time. all right, then. We'll reconvene next week and go over our remaining task list. Oh, I'll be dreaming about it all weekend, Raymond. Yes, I know, Maggie. That's it, everybody. Right back at ya, baby. That's it. The 23rd is almost three weeks away. Please make sure whatever tree he finds is both impressive and formidable. Don't worry, I promise, we'll find a tree that'll dazzle even you. Hey, you want to join me and your mom for dinner? Oh, I'd love to, but I have phoebe's housewarming-slash-holiday party tonight. Hey, why don't you invite Neil to join you? He's new to Brooklyn. -Dad. -Maggie even thinks he's single. -Dad! -What? You always do this. Do what? Every time you meet a new eligible bachelor, you try to fix me up. Can you blame me for wanting my only daughter to be happy? Besides, if you're gonna be mayor one day, you'll need the right partner by your side, like I have with your mother. Yeah, well, fortunately, I don't see you retiring anytime soon, so I think I'll have plenty of time to rustle up a man by then. I tried. I love you, dad. See you Monday. I love you, too. there. Yeah, you nailed it, as usual. I try. I am so glad you're home. Oh. Ladies? Some hot cocoa to go with your gossip. Thank you. extra marshmallows? Nice touch, tom. I think he's a keeper. That's what I keep telling her. you two are disgustingly cute together. I know, right? It's true. Married life seems to be treating you well. It is. You should try it sometime. Mm. Thanks for coming over early to help us out. You know me. I live for themed decorating. Oh! One sprig. you've got to be kidding me! What? What, Erin? What? isn't it beautiful? I had no idea you were so into trees. Huh? Oh, sorry. It's just we're looking for a Norway spruce exactly like this for the town-square lighting. Oh. Well, that's a relief. I thought that you had suddenly become super-into arboriculture for some reason. Nah. Winter fashion is still my obsession. Oh, yeah, that's right. Hats and scarves bring you light. Okay, so that there is Kevin Snyder and his daughter, Claire. I think he said he's a firefighter. And single. Take it easy, cupid. I'm just doing my job. Uh-uh. That is not okay. I'll be right back. okay. I'm going inside. Uh-huh. Excuse me. Who does this poor snowcreature belong to? Me, I suppose, but do snowmen ever truly "belong" to anyone? Fair point. But, in any case, the one living on your lawn could use a little attention. Why, what's wrong with him? Well, for one thing, his head is about to roll off. He's structurally unsound. Dad, I told you, he's funny-looking. Finally, a voice of reason. Whose side are you on? Hi. I like your hat. Thanks. I like your hat, too. Do you think it would be okay with your dad if we made your snowman a new friend? Are you part of some new neighborhood-watch program or something? Nope, just a concerned citizen. Ah-hah. Sorry. I'm Erin, and I was across the street with my friend when I spotted your snowman crisis. Oh, wow. That's not weird to admit at all, but your honesty is certainly refreshing. I'm Kevin. This is my daughter, Claire. -Hi. -What do you think, kiddo? Well... There are a few cherries and a carrot left. Perfect! Okay. First things first. Come on. Let's pack some snow into a solid ball. Come on, dad. I'm gonna show you how to make the snowman the right way! morning. Good weekend? I thought I asked you to pick out something manageable. You should have told me you found our new tree. I did what now? I gotta hand it to you, Erin. It was truly an inspired idea, sourcing a tree from our original town square. It's beautiful. It would've been nice if you'd consulted with me first. I spoke to the gazette this morning. They've already got a follow-up story in the works. Our social-media page is getting hundreds of positive comments, and not just about the nostalgia. Whoever this guy is, he's what we used to call a real dreamboat. Maggie. Stay focused. Sorry, boss. I thought I posted it to my personal account, not the city's page. I was so tired, I didn't realize. No matter. It's perfect. Neil already added it to our homepage. Ray, you should get your picture taken under the tree for the next article. You know something? That's a good idea. What do you think? Whoa, no. Hold on. You can't do that. I haven't finalized anything yet. Then make it official. City council won't settle for anything less. You know, we should talk to a photographer about that photo. I'll set it up. What would I do without ya, Maggie? That's a good idea. Yeah, definitely. Okay, chief, listen, if this is about the missing ladder, okay, yeah, that was me. I had to hang my Hanukkah decorations, and I'm bringing it right back, I promise. What's going on, chief? Well, word just came down from the mayor's office. They've tightened the budget, and there's no easy way to say it, but we're gonna have to make some reduction on your hours as well. Aw, come on! we were counting on those funds to buy new equipment. I know. There was nothing I could do. Look, I'm sorry. -What are we gonna do? -Can you believe that? Okay, okay. Take it easy. Take it easy. We'll be fine. We'll just manage with whatever we have, like we always do, right? Or you could use your new found celebrity to get us the funds we need. My what? Kevin? Oh, look who it is. Hi. I'm so sorry to bother you at work, but I was hoping you could help me with something. Sure, yeah. Yeah, come on upstairs. Just down this way. Well, why would my tree and I be newsworthy? More importantly, how did they get my photo? I don't keep up on the social-media stuff. Well, I'll admit, the photo going public was my handiwork, but the bigger news is that your spruce was chosen for our soon-to-be-renowned town-square display. So, wait. They want my tree? We sure do. You won't believe how much positive feedback we've been getting. Don't worry. We'll arrange everything. Okay? From cutting it down, to the transport to town square... you won't have to lift a finger. We'll even remove the stump and fill it in with... I, uh, I'm not interested. I'm sorry? I think you heard me. But why not? It is basically a Brooklyn honor. Well, it's funny, 'cause I'm not really feeling honored. Do you know you live where the first town square used to be? This is synergy. Tree-nergy! That's clever, yeah. But I'm afraid my tree will be RSVP-ing a firm "no." okay. I'm gonna level with you. This event is really important for all of us at city hall, and the mayor thinks your tree is perfect. Um, I'm not too concerned about pleasing the mayor. He should be prioritizing what the town actually needs. Let me guess. I bet he thinks this will make for some great pr. Am I right? Let me tell you something about the mayor. -He's... -my dad. E-excuse me? The mayor. He's my dad. Oh. Wow. Um... -Yeah. -I see. Uh, I-I didn't mean to offend, but it's true. Did I mention there's compensation? Ho, ho. Okay. Uh, let me see if I got this correct. Your dad cuts our funding and our hours, but he has no problem wasting money on a Christmas tree? Okay, maybe I'm not explaining this right. It's not just a tree, it's a significant event for our town. Let me start over, okay? There's no need, 'cause there's no chance that I'll let the mayor have anything from my property. duty calls. Uh... Good luck with everything. and thanks so much for stopping by. Merry Christmas. yeah. Merry Christmas. -oh. Hey, Neil. -Hey. Good morning. Question... do you have any idea what's going on with the additional fire-department funding? Oh, yeah, I've been crunching the numbers for the new budget. Unfortunately, doesn't look like the city can afford it right now. Sounds like you two are talking about the cutbacks? Yeah, I was at the firehouse yesterday and I heard about all about it. I had no idea things were so tight. Which is exactly why we need to bring in those tourists. We need that revenue. well, excuse me. I've got a meeting. See you for dinner tonight? Neil. Question for you. What should I get Claire for Christmas? Oh, my gosh. I wish I knew. I feels like she changes her hobby every day. Well, she's a tween. Isn't that what they do? Yeah, I guess so, but I just wish I had someone I could bounce ideas off of about these kind of things, you know? What do you call me? listen, one thing I know for sure, she's lucky to have you as a father. Well, you know what? I'm the lucky one. In other news... ...Who was that woman who came to see you yesterday? She is colluding with the enemy. That's who she is. What are we, a spy movie? She works at the mayor's office. She's actually his daughter. Oh! So she was here to talk to you about the tree. Yeah, she was, but I'm not gonna be a part of her dog-and-pony show. Tsk. That's too bad. She's pretty cute. I didn't notice. Oh, no? You didn't? I didn't notice. I'll be on my way. before I forget, did you make the deal on the tree? Please say you did. It's all I've been hearing about since he got home. We are still negotiating. But Steven actually showed me some other options I think are much better. They're, um... Leafier. That's not the point. It's a symbol of brooklyn's history. Besides, people want the tree they saw in that picture that you posted. They're expecting it to be there now. don't look at me. This's what you get for not using your teaching degree. Politics is in her blood. My father was the mayor. It's her... ...Destiny. Yes, dad, we've heard this before. It's the truth. And on that note, dinner is served. Yes, indeed! All right. I should warn you, your new neighbor is shockingly stubborn. Are you saying that I shouldn't ask him to borrow a cup of sugar? It's about the tree lighting. According to Steven, families were practically begging him to select their tree. Mm, it's just a tree. I don't get all the fuss. It's not "just a tree." it's a significant event. I just wish he could see how important the celebration is to our town. Well, maybe you need to spend more time with him to convince him? Maybe. But... How? hi. Please, come in. So, I hope you're here to tell me you've had a change of heart. I just came by to return this. Oh! I was wondering where this went. Thank you. Hey, you're welcome. Interesting. It's, uh, a mock-up for the Christmas display. We're building bleachers for the elderly, because some of them prefer to be seated. Mm. And it hasn't been publicly announced yet, but it's gonna be televised, so we are gonna build a platform for the cameras and the news crews, yeah. It's gonna be a huge deal for Brooklyn. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll bet. You see, the lighting is gonna go... well, that might not happen at all. I'm sorry? Well, I mean, judging from the specs, I can identify at least ten safety violations. Wh... are you serious? I had the parks and rec department review it, and they didn't notice anything. Well, for one thing, uh, your bleachers don't have railings, which your elderly citizens likely need, and the location of your tree to the cables and the floodlighting breaks about a half-dozen fire codes. Yeah, not as dire as an unsound snowman... ...But, uh, your designs are what we would call, uh... "problematic." hmm. But you got two weeks, you know? So I suggest you find yourself a qualified safety consultant. Okay. Fine. Do you know of anyone? Uh, give my chief a call at the station. She should be able to recommend one of the guys... Seeing as how they're about to lose all their overtime. Mm. Good luck... And happy holidays. you're hired! I'm what? I'd like you to be my consultant. If you're available. Um, I don't think that's a good idea. You know, I got Claire at home, and I'm not exactly a fan of your little holiday extravaganza. Maybe not, but I'm guessing after the chief, you must be the most qualified, aren't you? And I know you care about the safety of this town, even if you don't care for my father. There's plenty of other qualified... oh, come on! That's no way to negotiate. Present a counter-offer. Okay. Okay. If I come on board, I want you to guarantee me two things. I'm listening. Once we're done, the chief and I get a meeting with the mayor about the fire department's budget. Not a problem. And the second thing? No more talk about my tree. Can you start tomorrow? You got yourself a deal. -morning. -Morning! Christmas-tree cookie. It's cute. I thought you'd appreciate it. Okay. So, the first thing I want to change is the layout of the space, so should we go check out the square? Field research. Yes! Good idea. so we should move the tv news crew, so they don't need as many power sources. But from that angle, we can't see the tree in its full splendor. We could just shift it a bit. Okay, great. Done. -What's next? -Oh, hold on. We got to go over the specific guidelines first. Municipal code 43.1 mandates that all wires on outdoor public property be covered properly. Can we use festive ribbon? Those are not regulation. Come on. Aren't some rules meant to be broken? That sounds strange coming from someone in politics to say out loud. don't be so serious. It's not like I'm asking you to commit a crime. Well, aren't you? If it snows, then it could be a fire hazard. And I assume that would not look good on camera. Of course not. And, uh, of course, I want everything to be up to code. So why are you televising this event? Is it some kind of vanity project? No, not at all. We want to boost the number of tourists this year, and for future seasons. I want Brooklyn to be viewed as a holiday mecca. Okay. Well, I hope you're satisfied with how everything turns out. You'll just have to see for yourself. Well, it's not really my usual thing, so. Merriment is everyone's thing. How do you usually celebrate? I'm still trying to find my holiday sea legs. For Claire. You know, we host loads of festive activities leading up to the lighting. Might be worth checking out, for claire's sake. hey, Claire! Well, it's nice to see you again. Are you earning your keep as your dad's assistant for today? Yep. He said I'm his deputy. well, congratulations on the promotion. Do you go to west Brooklyn elementary? I do. Did you go there, too? I sure did. In fact, my mom is the principal there now. Really? Principal chambers is so nice. She came to my class to talk about the school musical yesterday. nice! Are you gonna sign up? no. I can't really sing. Well, that never stopped me. Having fun was way more important than carrying a tune. Right, Kevin? Yeah, honey, you should definitely participate if you think you'll enjoy it, okay? Okay. I'll think about it. all right. Do you know you live where the first town square used to be? We do? I have to tell grandma and grandpa when they get to town. I have those permits for y... oh. Hello! Who do we have here? Guys, this is Maggie, the mayor's right-hand woman. Maggie, meet Kevin and his deputy, Claire. Nice to meet you, Claire. You know, I just saw some kids your age making snow angels out front. Can we go see, dad? Yeah, why not? so what's on the agenda for today? Well, I'm actually meeting with your parks and rec people shortly. Claire's probably not gonna be too excited about that. Well, how about I take her? The cafe across the street is having a gingerbread contest today. Well, okay, thanks. Yeah, I think she'd love that. Hey, guys. I'm Claire. Claire is such a sweet girl. She must've been such a cute baby. Actually, I didn't meet her till she was five. That's when I decided to adopt her. I think it's wonderful when families adopt older children. Yeah, it wasn't too much of a hard decision for me. I was actually adopted myself when I was eight years old. I was living in a children's home on the edge of town until my parents adopted me. Then, about four years ago, I was volunteering. That's when I met Claire for the first time. It's like you guys were meant to meet. Yeah, exactly. The day I brought her home was the best day of my life. That is really beautiful. I can tell she loves you. I should get back. The mayor is probably looking for me. incidentally... Erin is single, too. oh, don't mind her. She's obsessed with reality-dating shows. Right, right. Yeah. Uh-oh. I think I need to show them a thing or two about the proper snow-angel protocol. Where have I heard that before? Hey, guys. I regret to inform you, but your technique needs a little work. It does? Can you teach us? I thought you'd never ask. Okay, first... You plant your feet hip distance apart. Actually... Let me just show you. Oh! dad, it's your turn. Come on! -Me? Oh. -Yes! You can do it! Let's go! all right. Okay. Oh! you should've warned me it was so cold down here. It is a little cold. It's cold. So, this is what you've been up to? Dad! Oh. Hi. Mayor chambers. And you are? Kevin Snyder. Lieutenant Kevin Snyder. One of our town's bravest. Ah, yes! The firefighter with the terrific tree. -Yeah. -Thanks for your service. Yeah, we do what we can, with the limited resources that we have. Kevin is helping with the safety compliance. Only 12 days to go till the big event. Yeah, you wouldn't want all that effort to go to waste on a party that results in an injury now, would we? I should hope not. Sir, the reporter from the gazette is ready for you in your office. Oh, if you'll excuse me, my interview awaits. -Break a leg. -Thanks, sweetie. Good meeting you. Good to meet you. That's my dad. Yeah. The mayor. hey, mom. Everything okay? We just wanted to give you our flight information. And what's this about a new job? Believe it or not, I'm working part-time at the mayor's office. How? All you ever do is complain that he's more concerned about his reputation than he is about the city. Raymond's a good guy. We go way back to our high-school days. If you say so. Email me your flight details and I'll see you next week. Claire can't wait. Love you. Love you, too! bye! welcome, brooklynites, to the annual gingerbread contest. The winner... judged by yours truly... will be rewarded with a prize of the highest honor... this glorious trophy! Whoo! Good luck! Okay, now, first, let's start with the frame. Oh, hi, honey. Hey. I didn't realize you knew Claire. I do. Claire is my new friend. Hi, principal chambers. Hi, Claire. Try not to get too carried away, now, dear. I won't. Thanks, mom. Hi, dad! Look. We're making gingerbread houses. Isn't it cool? It is the coolest house I've ever seen. Claire is an excellent student. I bet your all of teachers love having you in their classroom. Thanks for bringing her. Mind if I help get this to the finish line? The more, the merrier. Don't worry. We don't have any municipal codes for you to obey. Okay. Dad, can Erin come tomorrow? Yeah, it's the, uh, station holiday party. And yeah, please stop in if you're... if you have time. Okay. Thanks, I'll try. -oh. -Dad! Be careful. I'm sorry. Don't worry. It's not his fault. He's a Christmas novice. Well, then tell me what to do, coach. Okay, first, you need icing for the windowpanes. And candy. Lots and lots of candy. Lots of candy. here you go. hey, Neil. Hey, Erin! Didn't see you. I didn't know you were a gingerbread connoisseur. Well, I heard they needed volunteers to help the kids, so here I am. Well, well. I guess it's game on. Oh, really? Uh, loser buys dinner? Oh! Yeah, sure. You got it. okay. I think we overdid it on the snack purchases. Oh, disagree. Those kids are gonna go crazy for all this candy. Okay, fine. Well, if there are leftovers, you're eating 'em all. No way. It's not my cheat day. what? Who are you trying to impress? Hey, man. It could happen at any moment, right? I could meet the right person. Same goes for you. No, I don't see any dates in my near future. I got Claire and the department to worry about. Okay, but for how long? Because, pretty soon, she's gonna want nothing to do with you. Are you trying to give me a panic attack? It's the circle of life! Better get used to it. Remind me again how you ended up being my best friend? Yeah, luck! For you. oh! Neil. Well, here I thought I was the only one coming in to work today. Yeah, uh, dedicated minds think alike, or something? "or something" is right. Oh, can you ask Steven to send me that invoice for the tree? Uh-huh. Will do. Just firming up a few details... -right. -...With him first. How are you settling in? Have you been able to get out much? Not really, you know. Uh, kinda hoping a local might show me around. In that case, I might be the right person for the job. I've recently acquired a vast amount of very detailed information about Brooklyn. well, you can give me the cliff notes over dinner? Well, what about Monday night? After work? Yeah. Yeah, perfect. I, uh, I look forward to it. Me too. Okay. All right. Okay. hey, Erin, you made it. Hi. Well, Claire will be thrilled. Um, Erin chambers, meet Mitch Cohen... -hi. -Hello. And this is Linda jamieson, our fire chief. Oh, you must be raymond's daughter. Yes, ma'am. It's a pleasure to meet you. You too. I hear big things are afoot for your celebration. It's important to spread the word that Brooklyn is the place to be for the holidays. Plus, I'm hoping all of the locals will enjoy it. Well, my husband and I are very excited about it. Oh, terrific. Hey, do all of the kids have parents on the squad? Well, most of them are actually from the local children's home. Kev here's the one who made sure they got invited. Yeah, I just remember, you know, how it felt like, you know, missing out on all these moments before I was adopted. That is really thoughtful. Thank you. And it looks like they are having a great time. Well, listen, enjoy the party, everyone. -I'll see you later. -All right, chief. You know, I'm also hoping to enlist some more volunteers. You know, there's lots of different mentorship programs. Consider me enlisted. If you'll have me. Of course, of course. You'd be perfect. Uh, Erin, it was a pleasure to meet you. Nice meeting you. And we do have a donation bowl, if you are so inclined. Yeah, we were hoping to use the funding from your office to buy some new equipment this year. Oh, I didn't realize... thank you. Thank you. You must really love being a firefighter, huh? Yeah, it's the best job in the world. Did you always know this is what you wanted to do? Well, the cliche is that, you know, all boys want to be firefighters and cowboys, you know. I'm tragically allergic to horses, so firefighter it was. no, but in all seriousness, nothing better than serving the community. It's extremely rewarding. What about you? My dad has been grooming me to follow in his footsteps since... Forever. I actually graduated from college with a teaching degree. Okay. I even had a job lined up in Denver, but he offered me a job at his office, so I came back and started working at city hall. Well, as long as you're passionate about it, right, that's all that counts? whatever that may be. Oh, you know, I have to take this call. I'll be back in a minute. Yeah, sure. Well? Stop. Huh? Stop. Hello. Is this Gayle mcintyre? Thank you so much for calling me back. My name is Erin chambers and I work for the mayor's office. You sent in a picture of your farm, right? Well, I was hoping I could schedule a time to visit. We're only 11 days out and we're still looking for the perfect tree for the display. Great! Thank you so much. See you then. Bye. Erin! There you are! Are you having fun? Yeah. I used to live with some of the other kids. I miss them a lot, but my dad takes me to see them all the time. Oh, that's wonderful. You know what? I just signed up to be a mentor there myself. Cool! We're doing a three-legged race around the station. Do you want to be my partner? Do I ever! Come on. Are you competing? No, that's for the kids. Dad, you have to. Oh, my gosh. Okay. All right, all right. I ran track in high school. You're gonna eat my dust. Oh? All right. Well, I was running back on my football team, so the only dust that's gonna be eaten is by you. And that goes for you, too, kiddo. okay, now, before we get started, there are a couple rules. Each pairing is their own sleigh, and the first sleigh to make it through the course, to the north pole, wins. Now, I will not have any cheating. Claire, I'm looking at you. Now, once you're all tied up, we'll get ready to go! Yes, I did get a nose job. Thanks for noticing. On your marks... Get set... Go! step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Look at her face. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. -Step. Step. -No, this way. This way. you were saying? The soles on my shoes, you know, they're terrible. That must've been it. yeah, yeah. I'm sticking with that one. I'm sticking with that one. Oh, my goodness. -Let me see what you got for me. -I've got something for you. Okay. Consolation candy? Ah, thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. See this? You mind if I post these today? Anything for those "likes," huh? Okay, just try not to get Claire in the paper again. All right. Be honest with me. You want to get in that driver's seat, don't you? very, very much. Okay! All right. I can make that happen for you. Oh, my goodness. Okay. Whoa! okay, so you do know you can't be sitting in this seat without a helmet? Are you serious? Yes, I am. I'm serious. There's a helmet right there. Okay. Mm. Yeah, now just press that black button, right there. Right here? Yep. That's it. Are you sure we're allowed to do this? I am sure. Nice. There's just one last thing, though. oh, my. You okay? yes. That was loud. Well, yeah, that's the point. -good? -Yes. Well, well! Glad to see you don't scorn all Christmas trees. If you're here to critique my tree decorations, you're a little early. If I stay quiet, will you let me have that big spruce over there? Here I thought bribery in politics was frowned upon. Oh, come on. Even you have to admit it would look glorious all decked out in the center of town square. You don't give up, do you? Is it just me, or does that... Look like a heart? Yeah, that's what Claire always says. It's actually just a knot that formed after a branch fell off. Come on, how about we decorate this tree instead? Sure. Aw, Claire, you look so cute here. Thanks. Dad took that when I was six. That's right. Our first Christmas together. And my life has been wonderful ever since. Oh! I almost forgot. I got you guys something... Oh, my gosh! I love them so much! -You do? Well, good. -Thank you! How about you help me pick out the perfect spot to hang them? Thank you. Are those your grandparents? Yep. They moved to Florida a few years ago. How often do you get to see them? Not as often as we'd like. But they'll be here on the 22nd. So tell me, Claire, outside of school, what are some other things you're interested in? Well... I have been wanting to do some magic tricks ever since a magician got to perform at our school last month. Oh, I love my magic, too. Maybe I can teach you some of my tricks sometime. Really? Awesome. Thanks, Erin. But first, how about I take you and your dad into town to meet someone very special? Here's a hint... he rides in a magical sleigh. I know who it is! I know who it is! you think she's excited? Oh, yeah. welcome to tate's toys. Are you here to see Santa? Well, just go on back, then. Go ahead. Yeah. everything okay there? I feel like my jaw is gonna lock into place because I'm smiling so much. It's really hard work being an elf all day. But I'd better get back to my spot, because tom's still really new at this whole "Santa" thing. I'm surprised you're not lining up. Oh, I sent Santa my list weeks ago. Oh. shall we go and see if claire's on deck? Yeah, sure. You're really good with her. Well, she's easy to talk to. When I first met Claire, she had her little face buried in a book. She was so serious and quiet. Was it hard for her, living in the children's home? You know, the staff does an amazing job, but you never know when or if you're gonna find that forever home, you know? I remember, for me, sometimes, it was just better to just stick to myself and not get my hopes up. Having that in common must be partly why you were drawn to her. I'm so glad you guys found each other. Yeah, yeah, me too. I just want Claire to know that she can always count on me. -Oh, I'm sure she does. -Yeah. I can tell you're a really good dad. Thank you, thank you. I'm not always confident. Is it hard? Being on your own? It can be. I have my parents and friends, and the squad, of course, but... but it's not the same as having a partner on the front lines. Exactly. Dad! I'm up next. -Okay. -Okay. okay, here we go. Smile! I am so grateful for all your help, mom. I don't know where you get all your great ideas, but an exhibit featuring all of brooklyn's milestones... ...It's another winner. Well, I guess I had a good teacher. Is everything falling into place? Well, between us, it's less than ten days away and I'm still having trouble with the tree. I feel like I'm gonna disappoint dad. Sweetheart... Even if you tried your best, you could never disappoint your father, or me, for that matter. Oh, thanks, mom. I'm gonna give it one more shot with the owner of the tree tomorrow, and if that doesn't work, we'll just have to go with our second-best option. Is everything okay? I'm fine, I'm just stressed. But, tonight... Hmm? I am gonna be working on my presentation for your 6th-graders, so no more time for any tree worries. no time! wanna hit the gym after work? Oh, I can't today, man. I'm meeting Erin. Oh... Mixing business with pleasure, I see? Relax. It's called a business meeting. We're going over any electrical concerns that may arise. Oh, okay. So I guess you could say "sparks" may fly. Aw, come on, don't give me that. That was funny. Oh, hey, check this out. Look who's featured on the Brooklyn social-media page. I can't believe her. What? I mean, maybe it's not your best side, but I think you look pretty good, man. I'll talk to you later. Where are you go... oh, I'll just finish up for you, I guess. You posted pictures of me and Claire from the fire-station party to the city's social-media page? Yes, I did. You gave me permission, remember? I assumed you meant for your own personal page. I didn't think you'd use my daughter to promote your precious little party. Are you serious? I would never use Claire like that, or you. The first photo of us ended up on the front page of the gazette. Is this your way of forcing me to give you my tree? Come into my office. You've got it all wrong. Brooklyn is struggling and I am trying to revive our economy by building our tourism, okay? The attention from this "little party" will hopefully put us on the map, where we desperately need to be. Then why didn't you tell me that? How? You never let me fully explain the situation. Then what is the point of the posts? The point is, I am trying to use my platform to bring attention to the children's home and additional resources to your department. And why would you do that? They're both vital to the city! I just volunteered as a mentor myself, if you recall. Okay, so is this just about you generating good pr for your office? What kind of a person do you think I am, huh? You know what, Kevin? You have got to be one of the most stubborn people I have ever met in my life! Me? Look who's talking! hey, Erin. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to... no, not at all. Neil, you met Kevin... Snyder? Hi. Neil Stephens. Pleasure. I just wanted to make sure we're still on for dinner tonight. I booked us a table at fulton's. Great. Nice to meet ya. I'm gonna go, uh, evaluate your, um... Electrical grid. Enjoy your dinner. thank you. Well, this looks great. I'm glad we finally got around to doing this. What? Oh! Yeah, me too. I'm excited to explore the town. You know, see what this place is all about. Well, Brooklyn will grow on you like that. It's like pineapple on pizza. right. I don't... oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I am just a little nervous. Yeah. I haven't done this in awhile. What, like go out for dinner? Been on a date. Oh, no. Wait, you didn't... But I thought... Okay, now I'm confused. No, no, please, don't be. Um... This is my fault. clearly, I wasn't clear. No, no, this is all on me. I must have misread the situation, and my dad and Maggie, they were pushing me to... maybe that's it? Maybe you just don't date people at work? -Or maybe... -Erin. Erin, Erin, Erin. I'm... Gay. Oh. -So... -Oh! Yeah. I think you're awesome. But... I'm not your type. I'm sorry! I thought everyone knew. Obviously not. Obviously not. Well... Can we still be friends? Of course! Next time, I'll even invite my best friend, phoebe, and her husband, tom. You would love them. That would be terrific. Uh... Cheers. To the start of a beautiful friendship. a little birdie tells me that you and Neil had a date last night. Well, you truly are the eyes and ears of Brooklyn, Maggie, but you can tell the bird that Neil and I are just friends. Well, for now. Trust me, dad. It's not happening. 'kay. Have you looked at the city's website lately? We are getting so many comments about the tree and about that handsome devil, Kevin. Erin, you're on pretty friendly terms with him by now, right? Do you think he'd be willing to say a few words before we switch the lights on? It'd be great for the news report. Definitely not. Okay, well, if he's not comfortable with public speaking, how about if he just stands next to you on the podium? I have a confession to make. I don't think it's gonna work out with kevin's tree after all. Since when? Is he trying to renegotiate terms with you? The tree lighting's only eight days away, sweetheart. I know, and it's my fault that we haven't finalized the arrangements. I should have been honest with you sooner. I'm really sorry, dad. This is disappointing, to say the least. ahem. what's wrong? You're not your festive self tonight. Ah, I've been just thinking about dad. I don't know how he deals with all of the competing town interests. You're so lucky you don't have to deal with all this drama. Well, true. Don't forget, I still have parents, the school board, not to mention all the students, to manage. But you still love it, right, mom? I have to admit, there is nothing better than the look on a child's face when they learn something new. That's how I felt when I was teaching Claire new skills. Oh, speaking of... Hi, Erin! Principal chambers. Hi! This must be your dad. mom, meet, uh, Kevin Snyder. -Lovely to meet you. -You too. You're raising a very wonderful girl. Oh, thank you so much, mrs. Chambers. I should get on stage. The choir is waiting to kick it off. Mm! I didn't realize you were coming. Yeah, well, you're the one who told me I should check out all the Christmas festivities. So I did. Um, are you available tomorrow afternoon to take a ride? Claire can come, too. Any place in particular? Well, a farm nearby has a bunch of tree options, and I want to make sure I choose one that's safety compliant. Ahh. Well, good to know you found some other options. Uh, should we pick you up? I have a few things to do beforehand so I'll just meet you there. I'll text you the address. Okay. Hey, guys! We were looking for you. You ready to get your song on? We've been practicing our harmonies for days. You two are hardcore. Erin says the point of singing is to have fun and not just carrying a tune. And the student becomes the master. I'm sure you two will do a terrific duet. From your mouth to god's ears. Oh, Neil, you made it. These are my friends I was telling you about. Phoebe, tom, this is Neil. -Hi. -Hi. And you've already met Kevin. And that's his daughter, Claire. Hi! hi. Thanks for letting me join your crew. It's no fun singing solo. Oh, you're gonna fit right in. Well, good. Good. I'm just gonna take Claire closer so we can get a better view. See you tomorrow. Bye!

And as I explained over the phone, once the display comes down, the tree will be donated to habitat for humanity so they can use the wood to build a home for a family in need. Wow! Really? That's so cool. Yeah, I got the idea while reading about the Rockefeller center tree. They do the same thing, so I thought we could follow their lead. Why don't you take a walk around, come find me if you see one that catches your eye. -Great. Thanks again. -Thank you. Dad! Look. It's a donkey. Oh, yeah! Look, I'm sorry I couldn't come through for you, you know, but my opinions on how the city's run and everything that happened with the station's funding, it just wouldn't feel right, so... it's fine. I shouldn't have put so much pressure on you. I explained everything to my dad, and we'll find another option that works for us. Okay. Great, great. And, uh, the other day, you know... When we kissed... Oh, I remember. Yeah, I just have to apologize for that. You know, I shouldn't have let it happen. Well, we were in the heat of the moment. It's no big deal. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Um, you know, a one-time mistake. Exactly. A mistake. Yeah, I don't even have time to date anyway, you know? I mean, not that I'm saying you'd even want to go on a date with me... I get it. I get it. You're busy with other parts of your life. I am, too. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You know, I'm not on the market, and I know you're not either, so. Glad we cleared that up. yes, write that down. Mr. Mayor. Maggie. Nice to see you. oh, hey there. I didn't know you were bringing a helper. Well, I do all the work, he takes all the credit. Mitch used to work in construction and I wanted his advice. Yeah, you know what? I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty out here today if you could use an extra man? Yeah, sure, that'd... that'd be great. Why don't I show you where we've mapped things out? I'm Neil, by the way. Oh, hey, nice to meet you. Okay. Let's go check out the vendor with the doughnuts. What's that? Oh, I wrote a report about your safety concerns here in the square. Erin convinced me we should overhaul the space, so we're going to redesign the town square and put in some elevated seating for people to enjoy all year round. Well, I'm glad my notes came in useful. Very much so... so much so that we're actually going to establish a row of permanent vendor stalls. Oh, that makes a lot of sense for the community. It'll be a whole new source of revenue for the town. Your plans look promising, but you do realize you'll have to make a number of changes to bring them up to code? Told you he was thorough. This is just a first pass, Kevin. It's still a work in progress. Okay, well, I'd be glad to offer any suggestions. How about you two continue this discussion while I go see mom? Try to play nice. Of course, dear. Best behavior. Swear. ...And that's how we came to be. And that's why brooklynites love Christmas so much. That's right, Claire. And since you've all been such excellent listeners, now comes the fun part. We are each going to decorate one of these ornaments, then they will get placed on the tree in town square for everyone in Brooklyn to see. Okay, let's start with this half first. Come line up, get your art supplies. You are a natural with them. Seeing these kids get excited about learning is just... So rewarding. It's why I do what I do. ♪ it's Christmas time it's Christmas time ♪ ♪ santa's coming ♪ ♪ oh, it's Christmas time ♪ ♪ yeah, it's Christmas time ♪ ♪ candles glowing ♪ ♪ the best part of the year... ♪ you're saying if we built them as two-storey duplexes, we'd actually save money on materials? That's exactly right, and that way, it's more eff... efficient, yes! Of course. wow, did I enter an alternate universe? You guys are actually getting along? As a matter of fact, Kevin has proven to possess a lot of constructive wisdom. And I can see how much Brooklyn means to the mayor. Using his approach, we'll be able to save a lot on the renovation. Well, that's great. Then you can use those savings for city programs and employees. certainly something to consider. Uh, so, is there more to do outside? No, uh, Neil and Mitch... seems like they have it well in hand. Then can I buy you a drink, to thank you for going the extra mile? Claire's at a friend's house after school today, so... Sure. Great. I used to hang out here all the time after work with the other firefighters. We used to have a weekly trivia team. No way. What, you don't think someone like me knows anything about pop culture? No, it's just I can't picture someone like you... ...Cutting loose. Well, you know, I guess I don't go out as much as I used to, and, well, life basically revolves around Claire and work, but back in the day, I used to go see bands play at the red rocks all the time. Me too! All the time! I bet we've been at the same show and didn't even realize. Funny we never met until now. To be fair, I didn't start building lousy snowmen until quite recently, so. speaking of, I was thinking of starting a softball league in town. Ah, well, consider me your first teammate. Assuming I'd be welcome? how's your baking? We're gonna need some sustenance at our practices. Okay. I-I can bake like nobody's business. Well, I'm gonna need proof of taste, so consider yourself on probation. Realistically, though, if I keep taking on more responsibilities at work, I probably won't have a lot of free time for hobbies anyway. But more responsibility is a positive thing, though, isn't it? It's all a part of the plan to rise up the political ladder. My dad expects me to run for mayor eventually. But what do you want do? I don't know. My dad loves politics so much. You know, he thrives off of the pressure and being in charge. I just don't know if I have the same temperament. Mm-hmm, well, you know, you don't have to follow his lead. I know. I would just hate to disappoint him. As a father, I can assure you, that he'd be more disappointed to discover that you weren't happy. And as a daughter, I think Claire should see you going out and having more fun. I wouldn't want her to feel abandoned, not even for one evening. No, I understand your concern, but every parent needs a break. Think about it. Raymond. You have to see this. "can chambers come through?" I just thought they were doing a simple profile on me and my attempts to boost tourism. It's about brooklyn's financial struggles and your leadership. Uh-oh. It's okay, just read it. It says, "if he can't fulfill even a simple promise about a tree, maybe it's time for a new mayor." my entire political career... ...Reduced to a tree? Meanwhile, all we're trying to do is help this town. It might still be okay, right? It could be. Bloggers in Denver have been posting about the event, and I've sent invitations to all the local businesses. And I've already organized for charter buses to bring in seniors from the surrounding towns. We could still get significant media coverage. I just wish there had been another way to get kevin's tree. So do I. thank you. Well, well. Look at this. I'm surprised someone so task-oriented still has shopping left to do, especially with six days till Christmas. Very funny, very funny. Don't worry, with only four days left till the tree-lighting, you'll be rid of me and my task lists in no time. So, what? You don't think we'll hang out after this? With Claire, I mean. Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, I'm sure she'd love that. Actually, she's the only one I have left on my list. I have no idea what to get her. Are you serious? The perfect gift is so obvious. Come with me. hello, hello. What are you doing back here? You practically bought one of everything this morning. This time around, I'm here to help Kevin. He's the hopeless shopper. Guilty as charged. Not a problem. What are we in the market for? Please direct him to your finest magician's equipment. Oh, well, we have a few different options for that. You can just go to the back. Right over to your left. -Great. -Okay. Select wisely, Kevin. You don't want to help me pick the right one? Teach a man to shop, and he has presents for a lifetime. I'm sure you've heard that saying, it's very famous. I promise, I won't let you down. I thought you said he didn't laugh at your jokes. Well, he didn't, until now. Hmm. To be honest, I am just glad we can still hang out... Especially after our accidental kiss. what? when? Why am I just hearing about this now? Shh! Because. It doesn't mean anything, okay? Besides, he made it very clear he regretted it. Abra...Cadabra. Perfect! "perfect." she said "perfect"? So it's perfect. Thank you. oh, may I? -Thanks. -Yeah. I don't where my head is. I'm usually not so forgetful. Well, maybe it has something to do with yesterday's article? Oh, you saw that, huh? I did, I did. And I gotta tell ya, I can't help but feel responsible. Is there something I can... nope. I mean, I am gonna stop trying to change your mind. I'm gonna respect your wishes. Thank you. I appreciate that. Besides. We can always find another tree. As long as the tourists show up, I'll be happy. I think you'd also be happy to know that I'm following your advice. Which of my sage recommendations are you referring to? Uh, the one about paying more attention to my personal life. Or having more fun, as you put it. Okay. What kind of fun do you have in mind? Well, for starters, I'm joining Mitch and the guys for a night out at the pub tomorrow night. There you go! I approve this message. Yeah, just gotta find a baby-sitter for Claire. I'll do it. No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to suggest... no, it's okay, I'd love to do it. I could use the distraction. Okay, if you're sure. Yeah. an ice patch! Ooh! Oh... Ha, ha! That was amazing. Thanks! Come on, your turn. No, no. Ice is not my friend. Oh, come on, what happened to having fun? just go for it! Whoo-hoo-hoo! whoa! Oh! Oh... Are you okay? laugh it up, yeah. Don't worry, lieutenant. I'll get that ice patch taken up for you right away. Right. Okay. All right. I'll never live this down, will I? Nope. Right. I signed up for the school musical today. You did? That's awesome. Do you think my dad would like to see me on stage? Trust me. It will be his favorite performance of all time. Mine too. You'll come and watch the show? Are you kidding? I'll be the one cheering the loudest when you finish. okay, come on, come over here and help me, okay? ♪ ...Share this Christmas with you ♪ ♪ Christmas... ♪ ♪ it's Christmas ♪ ♪ I want to share this moment with you ♪ ♪ Christmas... ♪ ♪ it's Christmas ♪ ♪ and I want to share... ♪ ♪ this moment... ♪ ♪ with you ♪ oh, good, you're home. Perfect timing. You can help us frost the next batch. Oh, prepare to be dazzled. All right. Looking good. Careful. Hot, hot! -Smells good. -Smells perfect. What's wrong? My tree is being taken for official town use in two days. A crew is coming on the 22nd to cut it down. What? Claire, can you go upstairs and get ready for bed? But, dad, we're not finished... now, please. I thought you stopped pursuing my tree. I did! I'm as surprised by this as you are. That makes no sense. You work for the mayor and this is your event. There's a local "eminent domain" law that allows the city to requisition private property for public use, but I've never heard it being used for a tree. I should've seen this coming. Okay, let me just figure out a way to just straighten this whole thing out. No, thanks. The chambers family has done more than enough already. Kevin, I know that you're mad, but you have to believe me... I would never, ever go behind your back like this. I think you know me better than that. I thought I did. I think I should probably be going. Say goodnight to Claire for me. how could you? Eminent domain? Really? What are you talking about? Kevin and claire's tree is gonna be cut down tomorrow. I thought it was a good idea. This was your idea? I secretly arranged it with the city council. I wanted to surprise the mayor. You invoked "eminent domain" without telling me? I thought it showed... Initiative? We let the press know that kevin's tree would be on display after all, and the projected attendance is way up. Everybody give us a minute, please? Thank you. I can't believe him. You should've seen kevin's reaction. Maybe this is a good thing. The tree lighting's supposed to save Brooklyn. Our job is to look out for the entire population's interests. I wasn't expecting you. Your father's left for work already. Good. I'm not in the mood to see him anyway. I'm just here to drop off your presents. Why? Won't you be here on Christmas? I don't know. I'm not feeling very festive right now. I heard what happened with Kevin. Then you know why I'm so upset. Dad says he can't do anything to stop the plans. Don't be so hard on him, Erin. Your father cares very deeply for this town. He is only doing what he feels will benefit Brooklyn the most. mom! Dad! What are you doing here? Well, the flight came in early this morning and we wanted to surprise you. Merry early Christmas, sweetheart. Merry early Christmas! Where's my little angel? Uh, she should be right down. I'm getting up there now. Holy mackerel, dad. What do you got in here? Don't look at me. Ask your mother. ohh. so how is school going, Claire? Good, poppy. I got all "a"s and one "b" this semester. you did? Wow! Good for you. I think santa's gonna be extra good to you this year. I hope so. Why don't you tell Nana and poppy what we're doing tomorrow? Yes! I almost forgot. There's a tree lighting down at the town square tomorrow night, and I can't wait. I'm glad someone's excited. Too bad the tree that's gonna be lit is the spruce in our front yard. Are you serious? Oh, what a wonderful honor. So they keep telling me. You and Claire are gonna be a part of helping Brooklyn get back on its feet. That's something she'll never forget. I'm proud of you, son. Yeah. cheers. you too! what's up, Maggie? Everything on track for tomorrow? Oh, indeed. The tree will be arriving soon. All the decorations are ready to go, not that I'll have much time, but... never mind. This is a permit for re-zoning you need to review. Thanks. Oh! Now, that's a beautiful angel. Just like you. That's gorgeous! that's lovely. Nana, my hands are cold. Let's just get you inside and get some hot chocolate. Mm! Hot chocolate? Lucky! come on in, we'll get you some. - you coming, son? - I'll be in in a second. hi. Hi there. Mind if we get started? Yeah. We'll get out of your way. Thanks. So we're gonna need a wedge cut coming in right at the base, so we have to... anything else? This document isn't about zoning. Nope. It's an article on heritage protection laws. I just thought it might interest you. come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up. yeah. yup. Uh-huh... Uh-huh. Everybody, listen up! Everybody, stop what you're doing. Is there a problem? So, the mayor's office just called. Apparently, they just learned this land is eligible for heritage protection. So what happens now? I suppose that's up to you. Make sure you loop it between the branches, not just... yes! Yes, like that. That's really nice when it's looped. Yes. oh, no. Why is this tree here? What do you mean? I mean, why isn't it from the mcintyres' farm? This was delivered last night. That's all I know. look, make sure you put some in the middle there. Yeah, that's looking a little bare. greetings from idyllic Brooklyn, Colorado. We are on location here, covering what should be quite the Christmas celebration. hundreds of people are expected here tonight, and some are saying this could be the most spectacular Christmas-tree lighting in the state's history. Now, Brooklyn has not really been known as a Christmas dest... lunch is ready! Well, I think it's safe to say, these numbers are exceeding expectations. Since Kevin couldn't make it, I'm just gonna go check on the electrical... Uh, for the, um, electricity. We really pulled it off, huh? No thanks to me. I tried to call off the tree removal. Kevin could've applied to qualify his tree as a heritage site, but evidently, I didn't get in touch with the foreman in time. I'm sorry I let it go this far. One day, you'll understand. I quit. Excuse me? Politics is simply not for me. I'm resigning after the new year. I thought you wanted to follow in the family footsteps? I do. Mom's footsteps. I'm gonna finally use my teaching degree. I think that's always been my true passion, and it's how I can best serve Brooklyn. Are you sure? I am. My time with Claire the past few weeks has really opened my eyes to it. Kevin too. You know I just want you to be happy, right? I know. Thanks, dad. You wish he were here right now, don't you? I do... But that ship has sailed. well, if it isn't the mayor of Brooklyn, Colorado. Shouldn't you be at the square for your big day? Believe it, or not, I'm actually here on official city business. Since I'm currently off-duty, maybe this should wait till Monday morning. Kevin, please. Just give me a minute. I came here to tell you that Erin was in the dark about the city council's plans, and I know for a fact she would never have gone along with it. Well, I appreciate you telling me that, sir. I haven't told your chief yet, but Neil and I are taking a new look at next year's budget, and we're gonna make sure that the fire department's additional funding is fully reinstituted. Thank you. It'll mean a lot to the guys. After all, a town's only as good as its fire department. couldn't agree more, son. Mayor chambers? Can I ask one last thing? Sure. Who was it that suggested the heritage-protection idea? Who do you think? see? That's how it's supposed to look. How did you beat me? It's supposed to look like that. Hello? Anybody home? Hi! Oh, happy Hanukkah, dear! Aw, well, thank you, mrs. Snyder. That's very kind of you. So, buddy, thanks for swinging by. Yeah, man. No worries. What's going on? What's with all the cloak-and-dagger secrecy? Can you drive Claire and my parents to the town square? Yeah. Sure. Wait. Hang on. I'm confused. What for? Look, it's erin's big day. She's probably not gonna want to see me around. It's better if I just steer clear. Seriously? When are you gonna admit you have feelings for this girl? That is irrelevant at this point. She's dating Neil now. um... How do I put this? I can tell you for sure, she's definitely not dating Neil. How do you know? Trust me. Hey, uncle Mitch! Are you taking us to the tree-lighting festival tonight? You better believe it! Should we grab the coats and rock'n'roll? -Yeah. -All right! boom. Boom! Boom! Whoo! -Thanks, man. -Yeah. No worries. Any time. welcome, residents and visitors. We are so excited to share a Brooklyn Christmas with you. Since our founding, this season has been an integral part of our history and our culture. We'll be lighting the tree in just a moment, but first, a few more words. the holidays aren't just about the right gifts or the best decorations. It's about spending the time with the people you cherish the most... ...Which is why we are so thrilled that you chose to celebrate with your loved ones right here in Brooklyn, Colorado. ♪ have yourself ♪ ♪ a merry little Christmas ♪ ♪ let your heart be light ♪ ♪ from now on ♪ ♪ our troubles will be ♪ ♪ out of sight ♪ ♪ through the years ♪ ♪ we all will be together ♪ ♪ if the fates allow ♪ ♪ hang a shining star ♪ ♪ upon the highest bough ♪ ♪ and ♪ ♪ have yourself ♪ ♪ a merry little Christmas ♪ ♪ now ♪ ♪ a merry little Christmas ♪ Erin!

Guess he really doesn't want to see me. yes, he does. I'm sorry. I-I know you must still be mad at me. No, you have no reason to be sorry. I'm the one who needs to apologize, but I know you did everything to fix the situation. I tried. The crew got your message in time. -They did? -Yeah. Then why is your tree here? Because you were right, I was just... I was being stubborn. And at the end of the day, I want this town to thrive. If my tree will be a part of making that happen, then giving up our tree's the least I can do. Then I'm glad you came to see the tree in its full glory. I didn't come to see the tree. I saw your speech on tv. You said that this season is the time to be with the people who matter most. Does that mean you're finally succumbing to my Christmas spirit? I think so. Look, Erin, I know I said that our kiss was a mistake, but we both know it wasn't. I can't stop thinking about you since it happened. Really? Yeah, it's true. I can't think of being with anyone else but you. okay, everybody! It is time for the countdown! the moment we've all been waiting for! three! Two! One! do you promise to let me build all of the snowmen from this point on? Always negotiating, aren't you? Get used to it.
