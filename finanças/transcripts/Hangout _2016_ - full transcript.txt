No! - Shut up! - Just you wait! My boyfriend will not be happy to see me like this. He's here. Let her go, evil drug kingpin! - Thank you, darling! - You're welcome. Gross! Ow. Radit! That was too hard. That's not how we practiced it. - I'm sorry. - Ow. I'm so sorry. Guys, let's go to the next scene. Thank you, reporters, for coming. Any questions? So, what is the genre of this movie? I call it a hyperbolic action movie. Is it true that you funded the movie yourself? But that you are now having financial problems, so you don't know when post-production will start? One moment. - Ame! - Yes? Please tell these reporters to leave. - OK? - Yeah, OK. Radit, this is for you. INVITATION - What is this? - An invitation. Who sent it? I don't know. I just saw it on the table. - Thank you. - OK. TOTALLY STRIPPED Hello, everyone. Welcome to Totally Stripped... still with me, Soleh Solihun. Our special guest for today is senior actor Hengky Solaiman and his new wife, Shinta. Please give a round of applause for our couple. Do you still have the stamina, sir? Yes, I do. Praise God. You look frail, yet strong. - Shinta? - Yes? How does it feel to be the wife of Mr. Hengky who is... Well, like this. I'm so happy. Now I understand the world of an old man. Well, let's give it up for this new couple. What? - Call the guest now! - Not now! Call the guest! Everyone, what Mr. Hengky doesn't know is that right now, we also have Mr. Hengky's first wife on the show. Please welcome Madam Yuyun. Darling, what's going on? Darling. So, you are the one who ruined my marriage. - Calm down. - Madam. Embarrassing! This is a live show. Don't get angry. - I invited you to talk, not fight. - It's a live show. Calm down, ma'am. Soleh Solihun, I will sue you. - Ouch! - Why am I being sued? You get married and I get sued? Please calm down, ma'am. - Please calm down. - Calm down? How? Ladies and gentlemen, to help Madam Yuyun feel better and to be fair, I suggest that she remarry, too. Idiot! No. Please don't, ma'am! No, ma'am! That girl married Mr. Hengky, not me! You are the one who introduced them. But I'm not a matchmaker. - This is all your fault! - It hurts, ma'am. It hurts! Good job, bro! What happened to our show? We used to want to create something better than this. Here's the thing. It's all about ratings. You know that, right? Let's put it this way. Do you want to make a good show or be able to eat? Enough said. Sir, why did you throw my stuff out? I already told you that if you didn't pay the rent this month, I would kick you out. - It hasn't even been three months... - Hey, Raditya. Just get out. Here is your stuff. Good afternoon, Mr. Raditya. I'm from the bank. You haven't paid your loan for three months. I'll pay this month. Thank you. MONEY ISN'T A PROBLEM. REGARDS, TONNI P. SACALU What's up, Radit? Do I have anything scheduled on March 23rd? Tomorrow? Yes. An invitation from... Let me see. A Mr. Tonni P. Sacalu. I have an off-air event tomorrow, right? That's the event. Who is this Mr. Tonni P. Sacalu? I don't know. He booked you three months ago via WhatsApp. He asked me not to tell you. He already paid 50 million. Well? You can make it, right? This side is almost gone. This side is, too. Right? Surya! - Mr. Muchus. - Just a minute. Just look. There is a difference, right? There's a six-pack, right? This is actually a fake pregnancy. Can I share it? Take a picture of it? - Can I? - Sure. Good. OK. One, two... - Good? - Yeah. Share it with everyone, so that all the actors in Indonesia will know I'm doing my best to prepare for my new role. Right, Radit? Your acting is so mediocre. - Mr. Muchus, look at this. - Yes? This is how Radit acts in all his movies. "Vina, I've fallen in love. I'm single. I'm stupid." Flat. No emotion at all. There's no expression. - Thank you for your early roasting. - You're welcome. You're invited, too? Mr. Soleh, not filming today? No, I have another job. - Well, good luck, sir! - Thank you. Dinda Kanya Dewi! Soleh Solihun! Still as gross as usual. I forgot to bring my hairband. It doesn't mean you have to use that. Dinda, you always look so beautiful on television. Soleh. In front of the camera, we always pretend. We display the image the public wants to see. But when the cameras are off, we have to free ourselves. This my way of celebrating freedom. Who is Mr. Tonni P. Sacalu, though, and why are we all invited? He has to be a film producer. I'm sure you've never met someone this rich before. Where do you usually have your film meetings? At a convenience store? Well, it's not that bad, bro. Big projects usually start like this, Radit. My movie that won the award also started like this. Very mysterious. I was invited to his home. When I opened the door... Boom! It was dark. I could only see shadows. Actually, it was the producer's shadow. In the dark, the producer approached me. Slowly, he touched my shoulder. Then, he said something. I remember his words clearly. He said, "I'm sorry. We often have power outages." Look. I can see more people coming. Hey! You guys are here, too? Soleh was invited, too? Is that a problem? No, no. - How are you? - Fine. - Long time no see. Are you well, sir? - Thank God. - Dinda. - Hey, Radit. Soleh. Let's go. I thought I was the only one. What's the event, Titi? Not important, as long as there's money involved. You made that bag yourself? If we can make it, why buy it? You're right. Guys, say hi to my vlog. OK? - Wave to the camera. - Hi! Hi! - Let's go. - Come on. You see, guys. We have Titi Kamal and Gading Marten. Very cold. Raditya. - Do you want a protein bar? - Thank you. It's so you'll be fit. - You know? - Disgusting... If you keep doing this, in two years' time, your belly will have grown to the point where you can't see your penis when taking a bath. Seriously. Look. There are more people. Is that Gading? - Gading and... - Radit! Titi Kamal. It's getting crowded now. Someone from my father's generation, too. Don't be rude. Dinda. You're disgusting. Scratching your armpits in public? You were disgusting back when you first started doing dramas, and you're still disgusting today. I'm shocked that there's a girl like you. It's going to rain soon. You can predict the weather with your...? - Try it. - You're crazy. - I'm serious. - Disgusting. What is Bayu doing? He keeps talking to the camera. He's a YouTuber. That he's vlogging. It's like a personal infotainment. For newcomers, because the media won't interview them. That's his job. Record yourself, tell everyone what you are doing, and then upload it so the world knows. That's so narcissistic. It's OK. Wait, Shorty is coming. Soleh. I just want to apologize. I didn't expect that the movie would be that big. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I shouldn't have listened to a smart-ass like you. - Why would you say that? I was just... - I'm sleepy. Are you pretending to sleep? That's too obvious. That's too much. Captain. - Do we have to pay? - No, ma'am. I just have to drop you off and pick you up in three days. We have to be careful. There is coral everywhere. - Can you do it? - Yeah. Right? There's coral everywhere. Say hi, guys. Come on! Just a short one. Just wave your hand, please. Come on, just wave your hand. Crap! No! Don't! Don't say we have to sleep in here! No way. I could get a fungal infection. I only just healed from my last one. Oh my God. Read the sign! SECURITY POST It's a security post. I want to pee. Wow! This is it. Now, we are in the security post. We came from that side. - The boat arrived... - Is there a toilet here? Nope. Today's vlog has so many guests. We have Gading Marten, - Surya Saputra. Dinda Kanya. - Hi. Also, Titi Kamal. - If it's here, it means...? - She is confused over the map. - It must be this way. - What are you doing? The map says we should go north. So, according to this, it's this way. Wait. I have a question. Will it be muddy if we go north? If so, south will be better. We will meet the north point anyway. Excuse me. Please don't bully me. May I pee in here? Soleh? - What are you doing? - Gross! What are you doing? Just look away! - Don't peek! - Yeah, OK! You scared me to death. Just wait. Let me shake it off first. - Are you done? - I have to zip up. I'm done. What are you doing here, anyway? I thought you were a hairy imp. You're so mean! I already know I'm a short girl. Let's go. The others are here, too. They are over there. - Your urine. Gross. - It's OK, it's natural. Makes us closer. - I found this when I was peeing. - Prilly! What... Just be careful. - Where's Aliandoe? - I'm not his manager. Who is that? - Hey! - Prilly? - Yes. Hello. - Prilly? - Hi. - Why are you here? I took the morning boat. I think I saw a road sign there. Should we check it out? Come on. - Come on. - So, that way. North, right? There is no signal here. I can't upload anything. There's been no signal since we got off the boat. There is no signal. Only once in a while. There's clean water here, right? - For, you know... - Look. That's the sign. That way. - To where? - If I'm not mistaken, the sign points that way. Is that right? What is it this time, Dinda? - Are you pregnant? - What's wrong? - In labor? - I want to poop. - Oh my God. - In this kind of place? - Do it later when we arrive. - Smelly. - So...? - I'll do it over there. - Use this for cleaning yourself. - No need. Titi. Can I call you Maura? I'm a big fan of AADC. OK. But can you be not smelly? That's a hard request, Titi. Can you talk about it later? Not on the bridge. Guys, this would be perfect for an adventure film. Tell a producer to shoot a film here. So, this is where Mr. Tonni P. Sacalu lives? Excuse me, Mr. Tonni. Mr. Tonni, we're here. Mr. Tonni! Hey, what are you doing? It sounds like you're calling a friend. You don't ask rich people to come out like that. Then, how? - That's the same thing. - It's in English. - A rich guy named Tonni? - He will not pay us. - It was in English. - We're going in? Awesome. An ethnic-style villa. - Is anyone here? - A rich man's house. How many trees were cut down for this? He's definitely loaded. Hello. It's all wood. How do you mop it? It's not locked? Come in. There's another one. Look. The light is brighter. - Titi went this way. Titi! - I'm going to ask, maybe... Mr. Tonni! Soleh. - Can you help me? - Help you what? I need to do some product placement for the vlog. - OK, but share your subscribers with me. - OK. Deal? OK, guys. We have arrived at an uninhabited villa. It's very cold here, guys. Fortunately, I brought this: Rhino Brand Ointment Balm. OK. Let's try it. You can feel the heat, guys. It's hot. It's hot, ouch. Why is it getting hotter? It's so hot. Soleh, it's so hot. Ouch. It's very hot. What kind of balm is this? Cut! It's really hot. What's wrong? You're acting weird. I didn't record it anyway. What? You didn't record it? Dang. It's really hot. - Ow. - Two people can share a room. Soleh, do you want to share a room with me? Huh! I'd rather sleep by the river. Why are our pictures here? Yeah. I think it really is a film audition. Yes, you're right. You just agree with everything. Miss Titi. I swear. You're so beautiful. Totally beautiful. You are prettier, Prilly. You are more beautiful. No contest. You are surely prettier. No, you are. You are definitely more beautiful. Not really. No, not beautiful. - Gading, I swear... - Yeah? You are so handsome. Totally. Speak like that again and I'll punch you. Radit. Can I ask you something? What is it? What happened between you and Soleh? Do you know the movie Korea Forever? - Of course. - He was offered a role in that film. Then, he asked me to read the script and he asked for my opinion. I read it and told him it was bad, because for me, it would have been bad. So, he didn't take the role. You mean, he was actually asked to be the main role? The role that Lee Min Ho starred in? How could I have known it would be a hit? Six million viewers. Come here. I want to show you something. Here. This is my granddaughter. She really loves Korea Forever. Who doesn't? Radit, I actually have been living long enough to know that a movie is all about the title. It is the movie that will look for us, not the other way around. Just relax. I am sure, tonight, that I can make you and Soleh be at peace again. OK? - Thank you, sir. - Good. What? Who prepared this? I think it was already there before we came. Really? Perfect timing. I'm starving. Surya, come on! Why are we here? Oh my God. This is a lot. I could almost die just from looking at it. Why would you almost die? Oh my God, sir. Not literally. That's how popular kids in Jakarta react when they are surprised. It might be cold, but it still looks tasty. But, how many calories is this? A lot. Why are you guys so fussy about eating? It's tastier if you use this for eating. You haven't washed your hand! Oh my God! So sour! It's spoiled. That's your armpit. That's the taste of it. Just looking at you makes me feel sick. So disgusting. The last time I went to the middle of nowhere like this was when I climbed Mount Rinjani. A mountain? I always thought you were a graceful girl. I'm actually an adventurer. I don't like high heels and I prefer to create more than to buy. I like just being myself. - Gosh. - Oh my God. You're right. Maura, awesome! Dinda, that's so gross. So smelly. Prilly. To be honest, sometimes, I find the trends of today's kids pretty strange. I really want to understand their way of thinking, so I can be accepted by your peers. What is it like? - Really? - Yes, I mean, why, when they speak, so kids always make their eyes go... all white. Do you mean like this? Oh my God! Guys, I'm in a bad mood. My hair straightener is broken. Yes, exactly like that. Do you think it suits me? I'll try it, OK? My hair straightener is all broken. I just lost my appetite again. - That's scary. - Scary. OK, whatever. Let's eat. - Mr. Muchus. - Yeah? Your spoon is different. It looks dirty. No, it's OK. Stop fooling around. Let's eat. When was the last time we ate together? I think it was last year, sir. That was when... - Sir? - Mr. Muchus? - Hey! - Mr. Muchus. - What's wrong? - Drink! - Mr. Muchus! - Hello, guys. - We are having dinner. - Sir! Suddenly, Mr. Muchus started doing this. What's happening? Leave your thoughts in the comments. Bayu, he's really dying. - Mr. Muchus! - Mr. Muchus! What's happening? He's really dead, Bayu! Wait. Maybe he's just joking. Check him out! This old guy likes to prank us. Senior actors like him are good at playing dead. - I can't find his pulse. - Of course. Look at the way you're holding him. Are you trying to date him? Soleh, what are you doing? Guys. Mr. Muchus is gone. To God we belong and to Him we shall return. We must go home! We can't just sit and do nothing. Wait, let's think about this with a clear head. Right. Why do we have to go home just because Mr. Muchus had a heart attack? You don't want the money? Clearly, Mr. Muchus was poisoned. Didn't you see the foam? He was fine before. Wait. There is something we need to do first. How about we move Mr. Muchus' body first? It's a bit scary. Guys, I swear. I can't look at him. Enough! Let me do it! I'm used to this. Let me move him to the storeroom. Hey! Radit, just shut your mouth and help me. Come on, hurry up! - You sure you want to use this? - Yes, hurry up. How can you be so calm? I'm used to this. If you die, tell me. I'll take care of you. So, that's the final decision. We'll stay here. Stay? How come? Of course. Are you crazy? Mr. Tonni P. Sacalu said he'd give us the best deal of our lives. What if this is true? But, we don't know the danger that lies ahead. This could be a trap. You're always like that, Radit. Smart-ass. Your advice killed my career. I could have been a big film star. Now, every day, I have to handle odd people who fight on my television show. Do you know how many times I get scratched a day? No, right? I won't let your suggestion destroy them, too. Listen, Soleh. I tried to be patient, but stop bringing up your personal issues. Radit, can you cry? - So I can get more views? - What are you doing? OK, then. Those who want to go, come with me. - Let's go! - Let's go! If they want to stay, let them stay. Come on, Dinda. Wait for me! It's better to go home and play with my kid. Come on, Gading. - Gading. - Yeah? Where are we going? - I don't know. - What? Huh? Then why did you ask to go in front? I just wanted to stay away from Dinda. - She stinks. - What? I thought you were leading the way. - What's the matter? - Where are we? We're lost, guys. Lost in the middle of the jungle. Oh no. If I can... Ouch. Damn! - It hurts! - Bayu! - Are you OK? - It hurts. I fell down, guys. It hurts, guys. I'll help you. Hold my hand. - Ouch! - Come here. Those are my privates. Grabbing the wrong thing, guys. It's warm. Let go. - Ouch! - Come here. You still have time for that? Let's just go back. Are you sure? Yeah, it's dark and we don't know where to go. Come on. - Seriously? - Yes. - Hey. Are you sure? - Yes. Oh my God. Wait for me. Why did I fall down? - Prilly? - Yes? Didn't you star in that series about the werewolf? Yes. What was it about? I played a character who is a drama queen, very fussy, and always brings face powder everywhere. But one day, I was bitten by a wolf. So, every full moon, I start howling and change into the queen of the wolves. I think my movie AADC is better. Depends on personal taste. Surya, why are you...? Wait, guys. No, I mean, after thinking about it, I think we should have gone with Radit. This place is unfamiliar and creepy. There are so many trees outside. - There's a dead body. - Surya! - Are you crazy? - Surya! You don't have to be afraid. What's wrong with it? It's a dead body! Yes, because he died. If we die, we'll probably be like Mr. Muchus. Like that. If we die, then what? What? Probably, we'll only... become zombies. Surya. Zombie Surya! Surya! Surya! - Where are you going? - Titi, wait for me. Surya! What are you doing? Wait, Surya. Calm down, Surya. It's dark, Surya! I'll bring a flashlight! - Surya! - Surya! Prilly. Prilly, what's wrong? Prilly. I'm sorry. I just saw a full moon. After acting as a werewolf for two years, sometimes I still feel like that character. OK. Come on. - Actually... - Radit! - Surya! - Come on. Thank God, you are here. - What's wrong? - That... - What? - That... - Boo! - Boo! - This is him! - See? I was right. Staying there is better. - Yes, you're right. - Wait! I think I dropped my camera. - Just a minute. - Hey, Bayu! Bayu, don't go alone. Bayu, wait for me. Why can't we be alone? Are there any ghosts? I don't want to be alone. Surya, you're alone yourself! - Surya! - Surya! Let's just wait here. - Don't go anywhere. - Wait! Is that a sign? - Prilly! - Prilly! We stay here. It's dangerous to spread out. Sir, please don't do that. I could fall. No, don't! Sir! No! - Prilly! - Prilly! Prilly! Prill! Prilly! I'm sure Prilly was pushed. I heard her screaming. Dinda and Titi also heard it. - Yes. - Wait a minute. So, why did Mr. Tonni P. Sacalu invite us here? What is he going to do to us? Is he going to kill us all? I also heard Prilly say, "Sir!" So? It's because we disagreed. We should wait here until the boat comes to pick us up. I think we should sleep together tonight. Soleh, where are you going? I want to pee. Radit. You don't want to pee, too? - Why? - The corridor is really dark. Maybe something's outside. What if something is waiting for you outside the bathroom? I can watch your back. But should we pee together in one toilet? Don't tell anyone about this. All right. You can't tell anyone either. Where are you going? I'm done. There's still more inside. Try again. There's still some left. - Really? - Yeah. I still have some left, too. Yeah, you're right. Right? Soleh. Surya. Where did you go? I was just looking around. Let's sleep. I'm really sure, it wasn't like this last night. When did he cross them out? He had guts to do it while we were sleeping. We're being targeted. The dead victim's pictures are crossed out. - That means... - To stay alive, let's hide our pictures! No one prepared our breakfast this morning. Where are Mr. Tonni P. Sacalu's staff? If I don't eat rice, that means I haven't eaten. Just imagine this. Warm rice, plus a vegetable salad with peanut sauce, crackers, and raw vegetables. It is served by a long-haired, pretty lady with a tube cloth top and red lips. She serves it like this. "Bon appétit, Bayu." When she lifts it, the rice gets all over her chest. Are you feeling hungry or horny? Can I have some? No way. This is my last protein bar. Share a little bit. Just share it with me! This is my last protein bar. - Share it! - No! - Titi! - There! I already spat on it. Can you be more disgusting, Dinda? Yes, I can. Last night, I found a shortcut. There's a flatland in the forest near the beach. There will be a lot of game animals and clean water. Just be careful. Here. - Soleh. - Yeah! - Let's go. - Come with me, Gading. - It will be wet. - Is there any mineral water shop there? It's a jungle, bro! In a forest, rabbit meat is the best. Just be quiet! Don't be noisy. I'm trying to concentrate. Dang! It keeps getting dirty. So what if it gets dirty? This shoe is expensive, you know? Good thing the left one is clean. It's a Gucci. That's not a pair? You're a weirdo. Hey, this is fashion, you know? An obscure artist like you wouldn't understand this kind of fashion. Now both of your shoes are dirty. Right and left are different! There. What is that? What is that? This is it. This is a well. - A well? - Is there any water? You're right. Wait. You both check if there's water at the bottom, OK? I'll move away I don't like getting dirty and I'm allergic to mud. - Surya! - Hey! He was afraid of getting wet and now he's wet. Please help me. I might get a stomach flu. - Surya, while you're down there... - I drank it! ...fill this with water, OK? - Please? - No way! - Give it to him. - Here, Surya. Here. - Here, I'll throw it to you, OK? - No. - Is it impolite? - Look at that. Surya? You are OK, Dinda? It hurts, Titi. Fortunately, I'm a big fan of your movie. - What do you mean, Dinda? - Crazy girl. Guys, usually, in a pile like this, there's a porcupine. Is that a real porcupine? Yes, of course. Now, I will smoke out this porcupine. When it turns around, I will throw a knife at it. Back in the day, for extra money, I used to sell them. Why is it not coming out? Where is it? Yes, it's not coming out. Is porcupine meat tasty? Porcupine meat? It stinks. Near my home in Malang, there's a porcupine satay seller. It stinks? Dinda. Go there and sit. - Over there? - Yes. Hurry up! Here? - What are you doing? - To lure the porcupine out, we have to use something that smells similar to it. - That's genius. - Yes, genius. - Look, it's coming out, right? - It's coming out. - It's coming out! - Hurry up! It's there. Wrong target. This porcupine must be tasty. Radit, watch out! - Huh? - Titi! Titi! Titi... Titi! Titi, please don't die. Titi! Alya has already gone, Titi! I don't want Maura to die, too. Poor Cinta. She'll be left with only two friends. What will happen to the AADC 3 movie? This is scary. Too scary! - Bayu! - Radit. What happened? It's OK. I am OK. It's only my thigh. Bayu, come back here and help her. - Oh no! - It's OK! I am still OK. It's only my shoulder. I won't die. - Help her. - Dinda! Dinda! I think this one will kill me. Radit. I'm going to die now. Bayu! I'm going to die now. I will die first. Bye! Dinda! Dinda... Nuts. She only just died and flies are already all over her. Who could have had the heart to kill a pretty woman, model and famous actress like her? And who had the heart to... As for her, I can understand why. I think we are trapped! Why did Mr. Tonni P. Sacalu do this to us? Is it possible that Mr. Tonni doesn't actually exist? Maybe someone set us up to come to this island. The one who set this up is a genius. It's difficult to make this kind of trap. Yes, this is genius, but it's horrible. Eat. - Let's eat. - Eat? Come on. - Bro! - Bayu! So, after Surya fell into the well, he changed? Yes. Just take a look. His attitude and eyes are different, right? Is it possible that he killed our friends? Yeah, he's acting very strange. Maybe he's a psychopath. Listen to this. I once worked with him on a television show. Go, go, and stop! Hey! Where's my change? I don't have any, sir. - You don't have any? - No. You don't have any change? You are a parking attendant, right? You have to give me my change. When he paid for the ticket, the attendant did not have any change. He got so angry that he lay down on the lot and blocked the incoming vehicles. Where's my change? No one can park here except me! I won't move an inch until I get my change. Where's my change? Where's my change? Where? Even when he was taken by security staff, he did not move. - This is my parking space. - Come on. - I'll pick him up. - Where's my change? - Take him over there. - Where's my change? Where's my change? That's crazy! But, I already suspected Surya. He is the one who asked us to go and look for food. And then our friends died. And last night, when Soleh and I went to the toilet, as we returned, we saw Surya go into the house from outside. Huh? Maybe he'd just set up the trap. Whether or not he is the culprit, if Surya comes close to me, I will hit him real hard! - Bayu. Ow! - Dang! Bayu. Why did you hit me? Sorry. Your glasses are similar. But the cheeks are different! Gading, what's wrong with Surya? He's like a lunatic. Ow! - Sorry! - That was twice! Does anyone still want this? No, I still have some. No, I'm good. What's wrong with him? Maybe the food is not tasty. What's wrong, Surya? I remember... when I was a boy, our family... when we finished eating dinner like this, we used to act out a play. I know! Let's make a play. Bawang Merah... and Bawang Putih. I'm sorry, but our friends just died. Don't we have to do something more important, such as finding out who the killer is? You're too tense. We need entertainment. I think Soleh is correct. But, Surya is more correct. Bayu. You're a creative lad, right? Just go to the storeroom and... make costumes for all of us. OK? Use whatever you find and use your imagination. But in the storeroom... OK, I'll do it straight away. Bawang Merah. Why are you so mean to me? Bawang Putih. Just accept your destiny. Mom, Bawang Putih is being naughty again. Hey, kids. Stop quarreling, OK? We can't do this, Surya. This costume is very uncomfortable. It's itchy. I think someone peed on it. Moreover, the law forbids men from dressing as women on TV. - Let's stop this, OK? - Yeah. How come Bawang Putih has a belly like this? She would never get pregnant outside of marriage because she chooses her friends wisely. She is not a wild girl, Surya! Come on! Do it correctly! Go straight to the ending. Prince! Why is Bayu's costume the best? I look like a shallot-selling hobo. Look at Gading, a banana-leaf-covered fish in the garbage. The story is, Bawang Merah and Bawang Putih are sad. Then, a prince comes with a glass shoe to... Wait. Isn't that Cinderella? - No. - Yeah, the story is not like that. The story is not making any sense. No! No, it isn't! Go straight to the part I love. Her friends die, - one by one. - Huh? Die? - Dit? - Finally, I can enter into the story. I killed everyone. It's boring. What are you doing, Soleh? Just sit down, Radit. Eat this. Some meat. There's some kimchi, too. Do you know why I cooked you Korean food? Why? Because I'll never forget that you made me lose the role in Korea Forever. This is for my career. Good morning, guys. The second day on this cursed island. My friends are dead. Surya is acting strange. Plus, guys... there's been a power outage since this morning. So, let's go around the house. Guys, this is Raditya Dika's room. Meanwhile, this is the late girls' room. Isn't it crazy, guys? All of those pretty ladies were killed. I think I'm next, guys. If you find this vlog when I'm already dead, don't forget to tell my mother in Malang, guys. Mom. I love you so much. I apologize for all of my mistakes, Mom. Please don't forget to add subtitles to that, guys. There are a lot of my YouTube viewers who are not Javanese. Radit! Can I see your bag? - What's wrong? - Just a minute. I think the killer is one of us. The killer is one of us? The answer is in a bag that belongs to one of us. But, am I correct? Yes! I need a pen and paper. Wait, I will prove it to you. Bayu! Bayu? Bayu! Radit, what did you do to Bayu? Surya, did you kill him? Why are you accusing me? I went hunting outside so all of us could eat. How come you're nice now? I feel bad for yelling at you guys last night. I was in a bad mood. So, when your mood is bad, that's how you behave? People behave differently. - That's strange. - Wait. Where were you, Gading? I was in my room playing games on my phone. - Did you really just shower? - Of course. I use a towel and no shirt. But you're wearing socks? Do I have to tell you everything? After showering, I had to poop. I always have to squat when I poop, even though it's a sitting toilet. I wear socks so that I won't leave any trace. You actually squat on a sitting toilet? He's like a villager in a big city. You just don't understand. When you squat, it comes out faster. After we push, it comes out straight away. It saves you three minutes. It's very useful for people who are very busy. - Really? - Yes. Just try it. - It will come out smoothly? - Very smooth. Wait. Our friend died and you guys are talking about poop? Listen. I'm not the killer. Bayu came to my room and said that the killer was one of us. He said the clue was in one of our bags. I've checked three times. There is nothing suspicious. Wait a minute. There's something more important. There's no electricity. I can't shave. OK. I will go with Surya to fix the electricity. Gading and I will take care of Bayu's body. Why are the two of you deciding for all of us? We have to go in pairs so that no one will die again. - Soleh. - What? Don't you think it's strange? Bayu told Radit that the killer was one of us. - He died in front of Radit. - Do you mean Radit is...? It's impossible. He doesn't even have the guts to get married, much less commit murder. - We're missing something. - What? - Those who have died... are celebrities. - We are all celebrities. You and Radit are comedians, not celebrities. You are rarely on television. - Bayu? - YouTube is bigger than television. So, what's your point? In my opinion, the killer hates celebrities. How do I say this? Many stand-up comedians star in movies now. They host TV shows. Maybe, besides wanting to snatch jobs from real celebrities, - they want to take our lives, too. - What are you talking about? So, you think, Radit and me...? - So, you're just kidding. - Yeah. I thought you were being serious. Good job, Roy Marten's son. I'm getting thirsty now. I don't know what I'm talking about. Let's have a drink. Come on. I'll help you tighten the screw. We only need to connect this. - Finished? - Yes. - Let's try. - Are you sure? Let's just try it. Then we'll know. OK? It's working. Awesome. Let's go. Radit. I understand now. You must have thought... that I killed our friends. Yes, because you were acting weird. I'm sorry I acted weird. But you need to know that I would never hurt you or any of our friends. I love you and the others. I mean it. If some ants walk in front of me, I will move aside, you know? I will make sure I don't step on those ants. Even if they are still half an hour in front of me, I will move aside. Do you do that for ants? Not to that extent. You have to be like me. You can't just embrace humanity. You also need to embrace ant-ity. OK. Let me pack this up first. Remember, if you meet any ants, please take care of them. Of course. Hey? Surya! Soleh! Soleh! - What did you do to Surya? - I didn't do anything. When I arrived, he was like this. But, I think Gading is suspicious of us. - Don't let him see us like this. - Hey! Don't let me see you do what? He's dead? Hey! I should have known from the start! Both of you are stand-up comedians. The same community, right? - Both of you are conspiring, right? - Calm down. Why did you two kill celebrities? We are not the killers. Let's fight! Do you want to come at me first? It's not us. We are not the killers. You want to replace me as the host of Inbox? That's a knife, it's sharp. I am not knife-proof. You're dead! Gading, it almost hit me. If my penis is cut, how will I pee? Even now I can't do it properly. All the urine goes on my pants, thighs, legs, face... Do you want to have urine on your face? Are you crazy? Whatever! I'll kill you! Run, Soleh. Go, go, go! Hey! Surya! He really is dead. Hey! I know where to go. Let's go. - I'm tired. - Come on. You're so weak. Hurry up. See. You are tired, too. We are... To the security post. - Anything inside? - Let's see. There's a radio here, but it's broken. Can you fix it? You're an engineer, right? I recognize this. This was made in Germany, in the '70s. This is one of the best products they made. It was designed using a rare form of copper that time. - I know how to fix it. - How? This is it. Anyone? Hello? Anybody? Help! Hello? Mr. Police? Anybody? Help! Hello? Copy that, sir. What's wrong? Help us, sir! We are on Shark Island. Please send officers here immediately! There is a killer on the loose! A killer? What do you mean? Yes, a killer. He killed our friends. Killed? You mean their lives have been taken, or...? Yes, of course. They are with God now. Taken by the angel of death. They were murdered! They died! OK, we will talk to our superiors. We will make the proposal now. Hello? Hello? Proposal? Does he think we're organizing a music event? There's no time for a proposal! There's no computer here! We are going to die soon. Hello? Sir? Hey! Radit! Soleh! Hey. I will kill both of you! But not at once! I will stab you one by one! I only have one knife! It's impossible to stab two people like this. There's no knife on this side! Right? Hey! You both are going to die! - Let's go! - Come on! - Ow! - Grab his knife! In the morning, I host a musical show. At noon, a television series. At night, Stand-up Comedy Academy. Hey! Do you think I'm weak? Plus, on weekends, he has jobs outside Jakarta. Oh my God. Gading, you have so many jobs. Dang! Hurry, Soleh! Hey! Radit! Soleh! Hey! Hey! Stop! Come here! - Radit, I will lure him. - What are you going to do? Just wait. Gading, I hope Inbox loses to Dahsyat! Impossible! The ratings are still good! People follow your Instagram just to see your daughter, Gempi! Including me! They want to see me, too! Radit, I never thought I would say this... You're going to tell him...? OK. Hey, Gading! Your dad is more famous than you! Long live Roy Marten! Long live Roy Marten! No! Soleh, I'll kill you! - Soleh. - What? Take it back. Take back your words about Inbox. What are you talking about? Gading, sorry we have to do this to you. But, you have to know. We are not the killers. That means... it's one of you. There's only us left. - Who else can it be? - Enough! Don't listen to him. You better find a rope to tie him up. I'll look after him. OK? Just go! Radit. Soleh, did you kill Gading? Of course not. Why would I kill him? I went to pee. When I came back, he'd already died. You left him alone? Yes. I was not going to pee next to him. Where have you been? - You asked me to find a rope. - Where's the rope? I couldn't find it. So, you mean, there's a killer somewhere on this island? Maybe. Maybe not. Radit, where are you going? To my room. My name is Raditya Dika. If you find this recording, that means I have been killed by Soleh Solihun. Here is the story. Soleh held a grudge against me because I ruined his career once. Then, he invited me, along with seven others that might have done the same thing to him, to this island. Then, we were all murdered one by one. After this, I'm going to try to subdue him. I hope it'll be successful. What are you doing? I'm going to cook the leftover meat. You boil the water and I'll chop the meat. - Let me chop the meat. - It's OK, I will do it. I know how to chop it. I can do it. You just boil the water. Let me do it. No, I will do it. - OK. Let's do it together. - OK. How do you feel about our friends who died like this? I don't know, but I feel peaceful. Peaceful? Yes, just peaceful. There's no more fighting. You know that we don't have much time, right? According to the schedule, the boat will pick us up the day after tomorrow. I know. But, why do I feel like this may be our last meal on this island? Really? Do you know what confuses me? What? How can you be so calm, even knowing that everything has consequences? I feel the same way. Everything... has consequences. It hurts! - My eyes! - It hurts! I'll hit you! Watch out! Ow! Come back here! Radit! Hey! This is Mr. Muchus' body. He's an award-winning actor! - That's impolite. - I'm sorry, sir. But he's dead, so it's all right. It hurts! You bit me! It hurts! You fight like a girl. You just bite me and pull my hair. Disgusting! I'm so tired. - It's been awhile since I last exercised. - Me, too. My stomach is getting bigger. It obstructs my breath. How about if we rest for 30 minutes and then we fight again? No way! I want a 45-minute break. In 30 minutes, I'll still be dizzy. I'm about to pass out. Isn't 45 minutes too long? No, that's enough. Are we going to drink, too? No. Getting a drink will be too tiring. It's upstairs. I prefer to use the time for lying down. OK. We rest for now. For 45 minutes and no drinking. Then we fight again. - It's a deal. - OK. Watch it! Stay there. Don't come any closer. Over there, near the dead bodies. It will make it scary. How could you kill our friends like this? What do you mean? You're the one who killed them. Aren't you the killer? Of course not! I thought you wanted to take revenge on me and the others, so you killed all of us. I do hold a grudge against you, but I would not kill anyone. Actually, I have a plausible theory of how you are the one who killed them. What is it? You were possessed by the spirit of this island. You killed our friends one by one. That's a weird theory. That means... Who killed them? How should I know? When was the last time we were all together like this? If I am correct, when Mr. Muchus married his new wife. You're right. Only Prilly's body is missing. Why didn't we bring her body here? It was too deep in the gorge. It was difficult to get. When I checked all the bags, there was nothing suspicious. - But, something was missing. - What? There was no invitation in Prilly's bag. So what? I know why Bayu asked for a pen and some paper. Why? "Tonni P. Sacalu." If you rearrange the letters, they become... P. Latuconsina. Prilly. Latucon... Soleh! Even stupid people like you both... can finally understand. Prilly! Prilly, you're still alive? I faked my own death. Sir, no. Don't do that! - Prilly! - Prilly! Prill! Prilly! Soleh! Does it hurt? So, you're the killer of our friends? If it's true, what are you going to do? Soleh, run! How can I run? Look at my condition. Don't run! Come on! No, don't! Hide in the closet! Close it! Hurry! - Radit. - What? - Your thing. - What thing? Down there. What's wrong? It's touching mine. They are facing each other. Are they trying to be friends? Then, what should I do? Move it a little. Move it? Do you think it has a mind of its own? - Try it first. - OK, wait. I can't. Wait. It's inside now. - My thing is inside where? - Not your thing. Prilly. Radit. Soleh. I'm sorry to call you impolitely. Everything started at Mr. Muchus wedding. Remember? - What? - I don't know. That evening, I was there with all of you. We sat at the same table. We ate. We talked. - Mr. Muchus, can we talk? - Hi. We laughed together. Suddenly, this idiot, Radit, said... While we were talking, I got an idea. I want to make a film about us. The story is about us all hanging out. We don't have to use a script. - OK. - That sounds great. - OK. - Is it allowed? What you guys didn't know and never wanted to know was that my dad was seriously sick. Is he OK? But, what happened? Prilly! Prilly, stop talking on the phone and come back here. You prevented me from leaving that place. I was too late. When I arrived at the hospital... my dad had already died. He was all I had. I lost him because of all of you. Why? That's why... I really want... your families to feel the same thing. They can only cry when they see your bodies... without having the chance to say... goodbye. - Be quiet! Just be quiet! - That's... On the count of three. - We come out. - What about her? Three, two, one. Radit, we are two grown men. Why are we afraid of a girl who has just hit puberty? Didn't you see how big her bolts were? Come on. I counted her bolts. She only has two more. I'll try to make her loose the two bolts. Then she'll be unarmed. Then you can subdue her. - What are you doing? - I'm going to distract her. Prilly! You are too short to be an actress. You're only fit to act in Doll House! Shut up! - Doll House is fun! - No, it's not! It hurts! Prilly, your love story with Aliandoe is just a set-up. It's all fake! Don't bring him into this! Radit, hurry up! She's out of bolts. Kick her ass, Dit! Prilly? This is your fault. - You said she was unarmed. - I didn't know that she had a gun. I didn't see any bulges in her pants. Radit. Soleh. You both are such morons. Do you think I'm stupid and only brought crossbow bolts? Now, it's your turn. Prilly, why are you so evil? What? Evil? You're telling me that I'm evil? You are evil ones! All of you! You stopped me from seeing my dad! Why didn't you tell us that you were having a problem that night? You just sat for a while and left. I actually tried to go after you, but when I came out, you had already gone. If that night you had told us that you needed to go to the hospital, one of us would definitely have taken you there. And after your dad's funeral, you distanced yourself from all of us. None of us knew you had a problem. You never told us anything. So, just because of that, you're killing us? Just because of that? "Just" because of that? My dad was very important! Your dad? Why are you laughing? Why? Nothing. It's just funny. Do you remember? The nine of us joined a television game show. When you went out, your dad came. He came with you at the time. He said to the eight of us, "Prilly doesn't have anyone else. If something happens to me, please take care of Prilly." We all agreed. All of us promised him... that we would take care of you. So... if you kill us now... who will you have left? Soleh, we did it. We... Radit! It exploded. Radit! I'm really sorry. My privates, Radit! Radit! POLICE This app is called, "Help a Friend." Through this application, you can detect if your friend has a problem and prevent them from committing a crime. Just input their behavior patterns. There will be questions that you have to fill out to work out if your friend has problems or not. For example, do they become gloomy, always cry while they are alone, or have a tendency to hurt others. That's it. After that, a hotline number will appear, so that that friend can get professional help. Are there any questions? - Go ahead. - Is this inspired by Prilly's incident? When you were invited to a house that turned out to be her family's old villa, and all of you... That's right, this app was inspired by that incident. If only we had known back then that Prilly was having problems, we could have helped her, and this whole situation would never have happened. There is a lesson we can learn from this incident. If our friends are having problems, we should talk to them. This app will help us with that. THE SMART WAY FOR YOU TO HELP YOUR BEST FRIEND - Hi, Prilly. - Prill. How are you? I'm fine. Prilly, I once saw this Hollywood movie. It was about a female prison. When they took a bath, everybody bathed in one big bathroom. - They were all naked. Showers everywhere. - What are you trying to say? I'm curious about if it's the same here or not. - Don't ask her that. - Maybe it is like that here. - They have showers together, all naked. - Just eat, Prilly. Ask her something else. - Anyone asked to take a picture with you? - Huh? What do you mean? No one brings cameras in here. Maybe they could borrow the warden's camera. Maybe there's a Prilly Lovers fan club here. Prilly Lovers, the prison branch. Prilly Lovers are everywhere, right? Excuse me, sir. This is your food. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here's your satay. Thank you, miss. Radit. About Korea Forever... What? I want to apologize. We've been best friends for a long time. But, I got angry with you. You actually just tried to stop me from making a bad decision. Soleh, that's what friends are for. Sometimes our advice may not be the best, but our intentions are good. I just wanted to protect you. Best friends always do their best for each other. Of course. What are you doing? Are you trying to kiss me? I know we spent few days on that island and a lot has happened, but that doesn't mean you can... Who wants to kiss you? - I want to pee. - Again? You know my condition, right? What bad luck. When can I get that operation? Ow! What are you saying? - ...to remarry. - What are you saying? It hurts, ma'am. That's too early! Not yet. Ouch! It hurts, ma'am. Ouch. I think that's too early, ma'am. Ugh! You are really a... My saliva! Mom, Bawang Putih is being naughty again. - You're laughing! - Don't laugh! - Why did you kill the celebrities? - Gading, don't! He really fell down! My urine will go everywhere. I will need to frequently change my pants. I am... Ouch! Ouch! Cut! That's perfect! He hit him hard. I'll hit you! This is Mr. Muchus' body. The winner of... Ouch! I was shocked. Her dead body woke up. It hit me. It hurts. Ouch! It's better if we wait until the boat picks us up. I swear. That's funny. They're facing each other. You laughed! Do they want to make friends? Oh my God. You're laughing! Long live Roy Marten! - No! - You're nothing! - No! - Nothing! Damn!
