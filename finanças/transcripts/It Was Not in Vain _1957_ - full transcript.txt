IT WAS NOT IN VAIN Based on the idea of Pero Budak Screenplay by Nikola Tanhofer. Starring: Directed by: Nikola Tanhofer Record made in the name of Kotar Court Siracevo, on the day 17.7 the following year, at 10 AM. Commission made of: 1) Ivan Pavletic, the Judge of Kotar Court Siracevo, 2) Stjepan Nikolic, the clerk, 3) Dr. Luka Radic, a doctor from Krnje, and parties: 1) Marko Lipovac, the secretary of Krnje municipality, and 2) Albert Vidak... - Pardon me, my name is Vidas. With S on the end? - S, yes. Albert Vidas. - Yes, please... and Albert Vidas from Zagreb, now the manager of village working collective in Krnje has made an investigation on the scene and determined the following. The drowned Josip Rabar on his way home in the night between 17th and 18th of July of the following year, has drowned by accident. Injury on the forehead of the drowned man is caused by the hit that he got when he fell. By making reconstruction of the events, the commission members have determined the following? Dad? - Yes, my child? Are you sorry for Joza Rabar? - I sure am. Do you know what people say? - What, my child? They say it's because of the witch. They say she cursed him and that's why he drowned. Foolish talk! - I think so too. People are superstitious and they see some magic in everything. They say that for Mladen Vidalic too. They say she cursed him too and that's why he drowned. Do you remember? That was after 7th grade, when I was on holiday. And they say for Mara Svatonova too, that she hanged herself because of that. Because of what? - Because of the witch and her curse! No way! - Dad, will you help me? - I will, my child. Dad, you've been drinking something again! I didn't, child, you know I'm always this happy? - Blow! And on the day like this one? - Blow. You did, you've been drinking. I know you've been drinking. If only I knew where did you hide the bottle. - I didn't drink, my dear, I really didn't, I just took one sip. You see, if late Nikola is alive, God rest his soul, he was my best friend, but I'm sure he'd take one sip today too, and a good one! Poor man. Do you remember how he was always saying that he wants his son to takes over your practice when you retire one day. I want to know will you call Jure ?a coleague' now. - Of course, of course! There's no one. - Someone could've meet us? It's not their fault, I told them that we'll arrive by the night train. I didn't count that we'll catch the noon train. What will we do now? Nothing, we'll find someone to take us to Krnje. Jesus, what dust! So that's it. It's here. As soon as Jure comes I'll ask him to give you that antabus. What's that, child? - Antabus! Yes, yes? I don't need that. You see, if you lived like me in that wasteland all by yourself like a rock, you would understand that. - Dad, don't. Now will everything be? They got you, you old fart! I'm sorry, miss, I'm at your service. I always call your daddy like that. hat is not appropriate for such nice ears, but people in old age like ourselves can allow that. You know I don't like when you call my dad like dad, mister manager! Nothing, I'll try not to say that the next time. So, did your new doctor come? - Not yet. He said he'll come tonight. Fine, great, grandiose! Then I'm expecting all of you tonight at my place for dinner! The secretary will come, I invited him too! I got the pheasant, what do you say? I'll prepare him myself! Vera, Vera, wake up! Vera! Vera? - Are we there yet? - No, look. Look over there, I was born there. And that down there is the breach, you see? Look honey, something bit me! - That's nothing, just a mosquito. It's a green one. The grey ones are much worse. Just don't rub it or you'll get a scab. Will I get malaria right away? - You'll get used to it, we don't notice that at all anymore. Last year some surveyors were here, the story was that they'll dry up the swamp and make a fertile ground of it. Then they left one day and people were saying that they ran away from the mosquitoes. But that wasn't true, I know, I drove them. They had such a nice time here in Krnje. Everything has changed during this 10 years I was away. It seems to me I don't know anyone anymore. Honey? - What? - How are we going to live here? I owe Djuka a lot and you know it. If he didn't help me after my father's death, I would never finish college. That obligates me to? - I never even thought of that! - I know, I know, we'll stay until they retire the old man. And then? I can't be completely dishonest. My dear? Jure was telling me you are just a little girl. I was when I last saw him. - You've changed a lot. I'd never recognize you if I'd see you somewhere else. - Me too. I'm here, I'm here! You see how good it is, the mother of all brandies! Brandy like this only has our collective across the street. Talk to me, you're not saying anything! How was your trip? It's impossible to travel these days? the trains are so crowded... None for me, thank you. I don't drink brandy, I always cough when I drink it. Oh my God, that's awful! You see, and I cough when I don't drink it! Too bad, then I'll have to drink your share. - Dad! Now we could let them to get ready. - Yes, yes, you're right. Make yourselves pretty and make me proud. Albert and his wife will be so surprised when they see you. Is it good? - Certainly. With abdomen you can have all sort of complications, you can have perforation, parotitis, all kinds of trobmophlebits or broncho-pneumonia. - My God, medicine is wonderful. Exanthematicus is even more interesting, Typhus Exanthematicus. We have plenty of that here, especially with kids. Yes, that's nasty. But you see, I treat myself with brandy! It kills all the germs and all desiese. Gentlemen, my recipe is this: every day one small glass on an empty stomach, one before lunch, and one before going to bed. That's secure medicine. - I think that's the witch's method of treating. So what? It doesn't matter who invented it, it's good! That certainly can't have any therapeutic effect, but I think it can have a good prophylactic purpose. You see, these intellectuals of ours yell so much against witch doctors and they use the recipes of a fortune teller. Yes, and they forget that in that case they fall under the penalty of our criminal law. Prime suspect Dr. Djuka Radic shall drink this glass of wine in correctional purposes! All joking aside, I'd like to know who is that witch? Don't you know? - I have no idea. - That's Marta Krstic, Radak's mother. Is that so? - Yes, since Radak died, she started practicing witchcraft, that's how she got her new name. Now she's making a living out of it. - You'll have troubles with her if you get in her way. She's not so dangerous anymore. After she was arrested two years ago, she became more careful. She was released back then, because there was no real evidence. I'd gladly put her in a bag! But the comrades from the above say that we need evidence. It's like she and her son didn't make enough damage to this area. You know that, you knew her Radak well. - That doesn't do me any justice. Do you know what happened later with that Radak? Nothing is known for sure. According to everything it seems he died around 1945. The old lady is visiting his grave every year, she allegedly knows where is he buried. He was a strange man. We were inseparable as kids but? I remember 1941, that was the end of our friendship. We had a quarrel about some insignificant thing and he told me I'm a Communist pig. I guess he was thinking about my father, the idiot. Then we had a fight, and I have to admit he beat me up pretty good. Who the hell is this now? A man can't even have dinner in peace! I'll be right back. Tell me, Mr. Doctor, are heart defects dangerous thing? Well, it depends on what defects are we talking about. Who has it? - Me. They're looking for you, Djuka, you have to see a patient. For me? Who? - Some guy from Vrbovac, he says his sister is sick. - I can't go now, I don't feel good. It's probably nothing wrong with her. I'll go. How old is she? - 13. Do you smoke? Thank you. Why didn't you call for a doctor sooner? - I would, but my family believed the witch more. What was she treating her with? - At first with herbs leeches, and when it got worse with water spilled over hot coil. The curse has both eyes, the water one and fire one! The witch has arrived at dawn, sends the curse in the hill! Putting fire out with water, to save the sick one. Not on a man, nor a child, go rot on the trash! I beg you with water, I burn you with fire! Now give her 2,3 spoons of this medicine. - Won't that be bad for her? If you think it will, then don't give it to her, let her die. While you were treating with herbs I wasn't afraid, You fool, this is a thousand times better than herbs! Come on, my dear, here's a cure for you. Come on, come on. Open your mouth. She has to drink that, it'll help her. I'd make her to swallow, but that Mijo of yours can come at any time, and that'll be the end. Especially if he brings back a doctor with him. She's too weak for doctor's medicines. If she gets something that's too strong, it'll kill her! If they stab her with needles? - Poor girl, she'll die! No, she won't, don't worry. Give me that. So? I came back to soon. Yes, you came back to soon. If I'd given her two or three spoons of this medicine she'd be better right away, but now, she'll die. Not even ten doctors of yours won't save her anymore. - Get out! Get out! - No, no one will save her. Get out! Enough of your crafts! Come on, hit me. Hit me! Damn you! Damn your seed! May your house burn! May no one knows about your kin or your name! May you go blind! May the plague get you! May the swamp take you! May the swamp take you! Mister, don't stab her, she'll die! She won't endure that, she's too weak for that! Stop it, mother. Let comrade doctor do his job. It's been two hours since he left. What if something happened? - Don't, he's not a child, he won't drown. Really, comrade secretary, tell us what happened with that Radak. No one knows precisely. Maybe he was drunk and fell out of the boat, got stuck in the slime and drowned. You know, there's some places in the swamp where the slime is insidious and when it gets you, it doesn't let you go anymore. And maybe it was something else. There he is! I told you he'll come back soon. Jure, my friend, let's have a drink! Come on. Why are you looking that way? What happened? She died. Breathe deeply. Deeply. Now cough. Alright. Now stop breathing. Alright, now breathe. Alright. Get dressed and I'll give you a medicine. But make sure you take it regularly. Goodbye now. - Goodbye. Thank you kindly. - Goodbye. Next! What? - Next. A letter, for you. - Is no one else out there? Look how fast they are. How are you, colleague? Plenty of work? Only two patients today. People here come to see a doctor only when it's the last hour. News? Are they good? - It's from the central. I asked them to send me vaccines and they replied they'll send it to me in 10 days. Vaccines? - Yes, why are you so surprised? That hasn't been done here in several years. I'll vaccinate the children. Children? Against typhus? - Yes. And NDT vaccine. - Allow me, colleague, to warn you about something. No one will come to you, do you understand? No one! I know that. People around here don't allow their children to be stabbed with needles. They don't allow it. - And they allow the witch to treat them with leeches and roots? To put spider webs on wounds and to put stupes on them? They allow me only to pronounce death and to bury them! - Don't get mad. I only know that no one will come. Especially no one from the swamp will come. - We'll see! Pardon me, I almost forgot, I have another message for you. - What message? - From Vidas' wife. She asks you to come to see her at once. - What's wrong with her now? The hell I know! Since I retired this is the third time she got sick. She was never sick before? - What do you mean by that? Nothing, nothing. I just wanted to warn you that her husband is very jealous. Thank you for the warning, you don't have to worry! - Alright, you don't have to get mad, I didn't mean anything. I was waiting for you Mr. Doctor, I was afraid that you won't come. But something was telling me that you will come after all. My husband said that nothing's wrong with me, but I really feel very sick. You know what's he like. He'd treat everything with brandy, and he can't realize that I'm a weak woman. Should I get undressed? - It's not necessary. Just sit down. I'm really weak. I even think I'm anemic. Sometimes my feet get so cold I can't even move them. Look. Where does it hurt? Here. And here. You should listen directly, directly with your ear. I don't trust those inventions of yours! Your heart is perfectly fine, madam. Everything I see is a mild bronchitis. How is he? - He's dead. That's? Yes, that's the third one since I came. The curse has both eyes, the water one and fire one! The witch has arrived at dawn, sends the curse in the hill! Putting fire out with water, to save the sick one. Not on a man, nor a chicken? Don't be afraid. Kid! That one won't come for a vaccination tomorrow for sure. Are the syringes boiled? - Yes, I was just about to bring them. Give me. - Leave it, I'll bring them. - You think I can't? Do you know what kind of eyes do you have? Like a roe! You needed something? No, I just thought someone came for a vaccination. Come in. Come in! May I come in, doctor? - Come in, Mijo. What is it? Are you sick? - I'm not, just? Hello? Hello? - I was thinking, comrade doctor, let's vaccinate them. Bojka, needles! Quiet, don't talk in line! Is that discipline? When I say ?attention' you better pay attention! You report to the commandant! And you, I'll punish you too! Did you hear? I will be punished. Mijo will punish me. Listen, if you continue to be so thoughtful, you too will be punished. Your punishment will be a kiss. My God, it's so hot today. - That's nothing! Two years ago on maneuvers, it was so hot? - I would like to swim so much. What? - Nothing. I was just about to say how hot it was on maneuvers two years ago. Dear, listen to me. I can see how hard is for you here. I can see all that. Day before yesterday only three children came to the vaccination. That's all in vain. It doesn't pay off to lose the best years of your life because of that. Here's my suggestion: let's pack up our things and leave. Let's just leave and that's that. Will you? Tell me you will. Tell me, honey. Here she is! Here she is! There's the witch! Look at her! Look at the witch! How do you know that's the witch? - I'd recognize her from 10 km away! I've been look her for years roaming around this swamp. I can't be wrong about that. She must be going home. - She lives on Smaric? Yes, Smaric is over there! She going by? - By the boat. She's going by the boat. Is that a patient? There's something on my mind. Comrade doctor, how about we go to her house? I was going trough here? Eleven years ago. I was still a boy. - The witch didn't live on Smaric then. No, she lived in the village, with Radak. We may need it. And it's easier to walk when you can lean on something. Here we are. She lives here. People rarely come here. No wonder. The place isn't pleasant at all. That's why she chose it. She doesn't like visits. It's well locked. I really want to know what's her ordination looks like. That's not interesting. There's something else here, come. A goat. You got scared? - No, no way. I knew it right away it was a goat. And you? No, I too know what a goat is. - Come on, bearded pal, be quiet! Let's go. Listen, don't tell anyone about this for now. Alright. I understand. Don't be afraid. Just eat in peace. No one will come here at this time. They know about me? - They don't! Don't be crazy! If you leave me, you'll die. Who will feed you, take care of you? Who? They know, they know. You're lying to me. Why else would they come here? - Who? - Mijo and Jure. Don't worry, you're the strongest. Give me the money. Give me the money to get out of here and to get married! - No! I'll buy you a suit, but don't leave. When I'm by your side, don't be afraid of anything. What is it? What is it? I think someone is sneaking around the house. - It's nothing. You imagined. No one comes here at this hour. - Look. Who is it? Is anyone there? Hello! - Hello! Were you waiting for us for a long time? - Not very long, about two or three hours! - You're lying! Spare Corporal Mijo Kladar never lied! Doctor, tell this comrade not to insult me. Remember this comrade, first, Mijo Kladar never lies, and second? And second, Mijo Kladar is in a very good mood today. - True! I must say, comrade doctor, you notice everything. I would like to say to myself 'at ease, lie down and enjoy you have a 10 days leave'. Comrade Corporal, no less than 10 days? Comrade Captain, that's not much. - It is, you can't go. Understand? - I understand! The squad can't manage without me. Now, let's get serious. I went to see Balic family yesterday, the kid is much worse than day before yesterday when he got the shot. I think that the witch has something to do with that. I saw her boat nearby. Madam Balic won't say anything, she's afraid of you and her husband. Besides? I saw something else last night. But anyway, we better talk about that later. Alright, it's better that way. Now let's go to Balic's house. What is this? - The witch put it there. He had very high fever last night so I was afraid for him. - Didn't I tell you? Look Jure, they didn't use the medicine either. Why didn't you give the medicine to the boy? - She said not to give him that. Did the witch say that? - And who else? Listen, Balic, why did you ask me to come if you don't follow my directions? What do you mean? - Your wife didn't give the medicine to the boy. He'd be much better if he had taken it. Why didn't you give it to him? - The witch told me I shouldn't. Didn't I forbid that she comes to our house? - And if she jinx us? If she curses my child? I won't give up my Ivan! I already lost one! I won't give him up! I think there's something more I can do, but I'd have to go to my house to get some more medicines. You stay, comrade doctor. If I go alone I'll be back sooner. Just tell me what do I have to bring. - Will you know it? - Of course. Alright. Bring me streptomycin and penicillin. Ask Djuka or Vera. And a syringe, and bring koramin. Alright. - Did you remember everything? Of course, comrade doctor, I'll be back in an hour and a half. If he doesn't come back soon? Here he is! It was the wind. We imagined. On the mentioned day at 18:05 PM, the deceased Mijo Kladar, went from the place in the swamp called Balicevo towards Krnje. He was seen in Krnje around 19:00 PM when he was going back to Balicevo. During the bad weather at that time, the mentioned Kladar couldn't make it back. Now, let's get serious. I think that the witch has something to do with that. Besides? I saw something else last night. But anyway, we better talk about that later. After an investigation on the scene, commission made of mentioned members has concluded the following, the death must've happen after spine fracture in the neck area? I hope you agree with this formulation. - Of course, of course? This record was made by Stjepan Nikolic at 13:55 PM. We can sign it later. Marko? - Yes? I'd like to have a few words with you. - Why not? We can do it right away. She locked herself inside the house! - She has lay low! They're not crazy to leave! - She was calling her son for help. When they broke the door down? - She spit on them! She cursed them all. - Yes, yes? they're in trouble. They will all get sick and die! If that's true, too bad she `didn't curse you too? That's right! - They're taking her! Didn't I tell you? Didn't I? No, don't! I didn't do anything! ! Let me go! Let me go! Damn you! Damn you! There. I hope this wasn't in vain. Listen, honey, don't you think this would be the perfect time to leave all this? Someone else can carry on, you're tired. Well, yes. Why are you looking at me that way? I didn't say anything strange. I just think this is the best time to do that. Who can stop us? Tell me, honey, am I right? Tell me, dear. I'm not considering to that at all! Honey, will you finish soon? Will you? - I don't know. You ought to know that at least. - Vera, please! Alright, you don't have to yell! Can't you stop? What is it? Don't cry, it's completely harmless bug. It was drawn here by the light. - Don't touch me, I've had enough! Don't touch me with those hands! I'm sick of you and this swamp, do you understand? Enough! I already told you, madam, the best thing for you would be to get out of bed and to stop being sick. - Doctor, you can't just leave! I need you! You know that. It will be your fault if I really get sick one day. If I do something. You can't just discard me like that! - Now, now? be smart. I will? What do you say about that? It's not much, but it raises doubts. - Exactly. That and the thing you told me? It clearly says? - Mr. secretary, a phone call! Who's calling? - Kotar. - I'm coming, I'm coming. Wait for me, they'll surely tell something interesting. This will surely help you. That's double overdone plum. I guarantee that's a hundred times better than any medicine, especially than that medicine that rascal can give you! I simply can't understand how a man can be like that. First he comes to the house like a friend, and then when a man needs him the most he denies every help. I told him everything. How weak you are and how you feel sick, and he? Just chirping with a woman, like a bird. And wooing little Bojka along the way. That's more important to him than someone's health. What is it? What is it? What the hell is wrong now? Come on, don't cry. I poisoned myself! I drank all sleeping powders! Go quick and get the doctor! Go quick! I'm scared! When did you drink it? - Just before, when you left the room. Who is it? - Me, Bojka! I can't open now. I'm not dressed. It's urgent, I'm looking for Jure, Madam Vidas is very sick. I don't know where he is, he left. - Where? How should I know, I'm not carrying him in my pocket! If I tell you he's not here, then he isn't. - Where did he go? Who knows? He's probably wandering around the swamp again. He'll be back. Madam Vidas can wait! She won't die. Anyway, your father can go there. He went, but I'm afraid he won't know. I don't care. Jure! What is it? Why did you come on this weather? - Because of Madam Vidas, she's sick. We can't go anywhere until the rain stops. But if she's indeed very sick? - I know her. Besides, why didn't Djuka go when I was away? He did, Vidas called him first, but I though? If dad doesn't know? You're all wet. You'll catch a cold. I wouldn't like to have to treat you. That's what my dad always said. It's strange that no doctor wants to treat his family. That's because a doctor must work more with his mind than with his heart. When it's about family, someone you love? than it's difficult. But? we're not related. Nevertheless. Well? - Nothing dangerous. Barbiturates poisoning. - Poisoning? I know it's poisoning! Try telling it simple, what would be the wisest thing to do? I think it would be the best to call an ambulance. An ambulance? - If you get them on the phone right away, they could be here in an hour or two. And I'll? - Alright, stay beside her, I'm going to the post office! It doesn't stop. - I'd like that it never stops. Why? - Just because? I feel nice. When I was a child, I always liked to watch the rain trough the window. I was dreaming then. I was dreaming how will I became a doctor. A great doctor, the biggest of them all. That big like my dad seemed to me then. He was the greatest and the smartest man for me then. Just like? What did you want to say? Like who? Jure, why can't people tell the truth to one another? I don't know. - You don't know? You should know that. You know everything. Do you think I found the Sorcerer's stone? I knew one man, knew him very well, we were friends. He was a bit different, he looked on the world different than other people. Everything was fine with him, until he met a girl who was just like him. That was the worst. The were seeing each other every day, they were talking about meaningless things and constantly lying to each other! Everything they talked about was a damn lie! If they had any honesty they'd say right away everything that was on their lips for that long! There are some things you can't run away from. You cannot run away from yourself. - No, you cannot run away from yourself. Let me go. Let me go. Bojka! Vera, are you asleep? What are you doing here? Nothing. I'm waiting for you. I was waiting for you the whole afternoon, at Vidas and here. I got bored. - Really? Did you go there? What's with her? - I did. She poisoned herself. - Poisoned? - Yes, she took luminal. She said she did it for unturned love. She's in a hospital now, stomach pumping etc. And I though? - You're not feeling alright? Where's Vera? - She left. Where? - I don't know that. She packed her things and as soon the rain stopped? - Where? Where did she go? - I'm telling you I don't know, but she left this for you. I don't know why I didn't say goodbye to you, but I guess I didn't dare. It's simpler this way Don't be mad at me. But you told me long ago hat you can't be so dishonest and just leave this place, do you remember? You see? I also can't be so dishonest to myself and stay here. I'm too young for that. I would die here. will be at my mother now, and if you ever come to Zagreb, pay me a visit, I will be glad. A glass of brandy! Not that one, this one! My dear mister, that's what I call a sip! It seems that everyone gets thirsty in this swamp. Who could expect such sudden progress with you? I had to drink something. - Naturally, we have to drink too. We all have to. - That's right. Stevo, give us another round on my tab. Give us these big glasses too. If our medicus can drink from a big glass, why can't we? Do you know what is medicus, Stevo? You do? Like hell you do! I'll explain it to you. Medicus is? - Shut up, you! You don't know either! Medicus is, my dear sir, something that's useless. It's green, and you find it on places you shouldn't. What do you say, doctor? Did I explain it to him right? You know what, doctor? I have a suggestion. How would you like to us to become bosom pals? Besides, I think it's time to do that already. Especially now, when our wives left. Yours to her mother, and mine? Anyway, it doesn't matter now. Shall we? Hey, kid, wait up! Aren't we going to become bosom pals? My dear sir, when someone senior offers you that, you can't refuse that. I'll teach you order! You vulture! You undertaker! - People, stop him, he'll kill him! I'll teach him! The vulture! I'll teach him right! A scum! If they didn't teach him in school, I'll teach him! That's it, you mule, it was about time you wake up. Why are you looking at me like you don't know me? Maybe you would like me to introduce myself? Alright, I'm Red Riding Hood. Oh, dear, you're cold like a fish. Last night when we brought you, your temperature was over 40. That's nothing, I put a band aid, you can take it off if you want. I was expecting much worse. But you were holding up very well, and all that in the middle of malaria attack. Qquarterly or tertiary? - Tertiary, of course. I made a smear this morning. I haven't done that for good 10 years. Stay in bed for a little longer and I'm going to the ordination. You know, I think you'll soon start to miss the witch. Why? - Because? You eliminated your competition, and now you have her patients beside yours. The hall is filled with them. I'll never regret that. - We'll see. Where's Bojka? - Having a swim. Bojka! Bojka! What is it, Bojka? What is it? What happened? Tell me? - At the lake? Someone was running behind me! - Calm down, dear, it must've been some animal. It wasn't, it wasn?t. I heard it well. - Bojka? - Someone was running. That's because of the sun, Bojka. Is it alright now? It's alright. There, it looks like we'll soon find out a real truth about Mijo's death. And maybe a lot of other things will come out to the open. Are you going already? - I have to. - Pity, I wanted to have a little more talk with you. You know? I have to visit a patient, I scheduled a vaccination for 3 PM. - Then come tonight. I will, bye. - Bye. If you ever let me to wait for you this long again? Radak! Let me go! - Don't you like me? Is Jure prettier than me? - Let me go! Will you run away from me? Go. Why are you running away, honey? You think I'm a ghost? Don't be afraid. Those who told you I died were lying. But you won't tell that to anyone. Why should you end up like Mara Svatonova? Like Joza Rabar, like Mijo? Don't be afraid, don't be afraid! I won't hurt you. I'll just kiss you, trust me. I'll be better for you than Jure. You're restless, huh? You can't be disobedient! You should thank me for being so nice with you! Help! You won't, you won't! You'll have to kill me! Sound the alert! At once! Jure, look out! I should've killed you sooner! As soon as you arrived! You think you wouldn?t be caught? They still didn't catch me! Radak is still alive! Stop, Radak! Don't move! Don't worry, princess, he'll be fine. He could take twice this much. I know that best, am I right? What are you doing here? - By chance. Comrade Vidas brought us here He was the first who noticed that you're here. I'm sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Delic, from criminal management. You've done us a great favour. Man, you have a terrible cold. It's no surprise, with all this moist here? And I'm from Dalmatia. - Come to my ordination and I'll give you something. We have to hurry, today is vaccination day, they're surely waiting for you. I already heard. Everyone know already. I felt sorry to keep them wait so I started. It was not in vain! Translated by Inglourious @KG THE END
