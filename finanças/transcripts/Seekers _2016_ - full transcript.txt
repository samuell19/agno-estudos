- Mom. Dad. If you see this, I may already be dead. I love you... - Does this camera have to run all the time? Isn't it enough that we start filming tomorrow? I feel so watched! - You'll get used to the cameras. We need it all for our documentary. - You sure she's working today? - Yeah, but I don't think it's a good idea to bother her. - Come on. It's a side job. We just wanna tell her about our trip tomorrow. We're here. - Does the camera have to run all the time? - Ha ha. - Honey, come on. - Okay, I'm coming. - You're the best. - I'll take the train! - Yeah. You lazy sack! Bye! You're doing a great job! Nee mahhh! Mahhh! She doesn't answer me. Mahhh! I'm probably speaking the wrong language. Moo! She doesn't understand that either. - There she is. - Boo! - What's with the camera? - That's Martin. He's coming on our our trip. We have several cameras. We're documenting and filming everything. - Sorry, I couldn't talk them out of it. - Oh man. Thanks for asking me. - Come on, it'll be fun. - It's gonna be great. - Tomorrow morning at nine we go as planned... We'll meet at the station. Alin checked the train schedule... And tonight we'll go through everything again. - It is getting good! - Yeah... I believe you. - Okay. - Good, let's go. - Hey, you stupid cow. - Say a few words to our viewers. - Well, I'm Mike... And this is my friend Alin. She's in her sixth semester studying law. - Nobody wants to know that. - Okay, who who else do we have? There's Sarah, the friendly park worker. George. He's riding right behind us. Hi George. - Hey! - Alright? And the silent man behind the camera is Martin. - Martin - Martin is coming with us, and filming everything. - We are so-called "geocachers". For people who don't know what Geocaching is, I'll explain it... Geocaching is a modern form of a treasure hunt... Or a scavenger hunt. You get coordinates from the Internet... And um, you enter the coordinates in a GPS tracker. And, someone hides something at the coordinates. And when you find the coordinates, you get the treasure. And we call them "caches". Was that understandable? - Reasonably. Perhaps you should add that there are different types of geocaches. You can document finds, for example, entered them into a logbook. Sometimes a cache contains swap items. You take something out of the cache and swap in something you own. Um, the most important thing is that you can't get caught finding a cache... by normal people or passers-by. Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide share our hobby. And... Where are we going this time, dear Ali? - This time we're going to Poland. In the northern Giant Mountains. We're totally well equipped... We have a map. We have GPS receivers. We are very curious about what to expect. We're hanging! - Isn't this cool? Oh, I'm hanging! - Are you alright? - Turn off the camera. - that was right after you got drunk. - Josh, do you need anything? - Mom, I have everything. I don't need anything. - Okay. - So... Everyone. Listen. I checked everything again. We're well prepared. I've got everything listed here. - Um hmm. - Good. - Please don't forget to pack warm things. It's getting really cold. - Nothing with cut-out - No. - Everyone please smile. For a before and after picture. - Come into my arms! - Well, do you have everything? There's no turning back. - Everything's here. - Nice. - No idea, he'll make it. - Where is he? Where? Ah. - Poor... - That's typical. - Mike! - George. - Run! - Really? Well, George, you'll probably have to take the car. - That's so typical. - Really. Man! - Come in my dear. - Well, shit. - So, make yourself comfortable. - Hey, hey! - George, What do you expect from this trip? - What do I expect? Definitely and exciting trip untouched nature And yes, I expect to find lots of treasure. - We finally arrived. We're looking for somewhere cheap to stay, then we start tomorrow morning. Hey! Shit. - We must be over here. - It's really desolate. I can't find a soul. - Hey guys. We found a boarding house. - Cool. Where? - Not far. - Okay, come on. Final sprint! - Look, chickens. - How did you sleep last night? - I had a pretty shitty night. I didn't close my eyes. It wasn't a real boarding house. I had to sleep in the same room as the landlady's son. - For someone who didn't close their eyes, you snored pretty loudly. - Now we have a long walk through the forest. Also, I'm freezing my ass off. - Hey Georgie. - Men are so sensitive. - That's true too. - I see you've made friends with the camera. - Slowly but surely. - I'm so hungry. - I hear you. - Careful. A car's coming. - He's pulling over! What's he doing? - Hey, should we look inside? - No. I really don't want to know what it is. - Really? - No. Come on. Let's go. - What does this remind you of, honey? - Bondage? I'm joking, of course. Wow. Martin, look at that tree. Look at that tree. - Wow, that's cool. Imagine hiding caches up there. - You would have to climb up there. So, we are about to... We're off right now... You're not filming yet, are you? No. - Okay We are about to find our first cache. So, our first treasure on this trip. Um, according to our GPS, It should be hidden somewhere nearby. I hope we find it. - Bring the camera over here. - Sure. Of course. - My lady. - Thank you. - It must be somewhere in this clearing. It's not that precise. - So, we're looking for something that' doesn't belong here. Something that's not natural. - That's difficult. - Wait, there might be something over there. - Yeah, that doesn't look like it belongs, right? - Sarah. You don't see anything, right? - Do you see something? Ha-ha! Damn! Our first! - Come on, open it. - Tadaa! Log book. - Rosary - That's odd. - Show me. It's beautiful. Can I keep it? Sure... But you have to write something personal about yourself. - Those are the rules. - What's that? - My lucky charm. I've had it since communion. But, I don't know who gave it to me. - Beautiful I'll just put it in here. - And? Does it fit me? - Yes! - Show me. - Everybody, gather around. Cache photo! - Award winning photo! - Everyone smile. - Oh wait, wait. Sarah! - Stand closer together. Everyone smile. Three, two, one... Cache! Cache! - I can't go any further. My feet hurt. - Maybe we should stop for today and build our tents. What do you think? - Yeah. I'm in for that. - For me, it's getting too dark. Should we stop here? - What have you got there? - Pasta. - Tell me, does it bother you that you're never in the picture? Most of the time it's only us. - Not at all. I'd rather be behind the camera. I feel uncomfortable in front of her. Oh yes. Anyway, I'll turn the camera off. Sorry. - Well, Geordie, is the documentary going well? - Yes. I've got everything. The next cache is going to be... fun, but exhausting. Do you want to see? - Ah Mike. Do we have to do this now? This looks strange, don't you think? - Are you worried about your reputation? - Whatever. Where's Martin? - No idea. He went outside to do something. - Good morning. - Good morning sweetheart. You slept really well. - Yeah. - Morning. - Does anyone know where my backpack is? It's missing. - I don't have it. It must be somewhere. - I put it in our tent. It's gone. - Here's your backpack. You probably parked it here. Thank God. I thought it was gone. - Whoa! - Wow - Mike... I'm your mother! - I'm your mother! - Look at this. It's so beautiful. - Oh, I didn't shoot this. - Look over there! Isn't that cool! - Hey Martin. Can I have the camera? I have to film that. - You're good with the camera. - Can you focus this? Thank you. - I wonder where the cache is hidden. - Me too. - I hope we don't have to climb. - Hey Martin, let me know if I need to take the camera. - And what do you have to say? - Super nice. Madness. - Let's keep moving. - Mike. Hey. - I can't. I have to film. That was good. - Come on. - Unfortunately, we've had the first casualty on our trip. - Let me see. - It's not that bad. I broke a nail. It works. - Yes? Good? Let's go. ATTENTION! - Hey guys. Come here. - Do you think that's it? - We'll see very shortly. Definitely an original hiding place. - Are you ready? - Hello there. - Our second cache! - Nothing. - Well, great. - That was worth it. - Such Crap. - Pity. - Let the container down again. - Well, onto the next cache, right? - We're now on our way to our last cache. We don't have much information. We only know that it's a lost place. - What isn't a lost place? - A lost place can be almost anything. Like an old house, an abandoned factory, a ruin. But such caches are really hard to find. Martin! - When will we get there? - Not much further. Keep up. - So, as you can see, the mood here is quite heated... because the destination is further than expected. - Oh, get away from me. - I think we're lost. We were already here. - This can't be. - I'm sure. I recognize this place. - Everything looks the same. Give it to me. - We should've arrived a long time ago. I don't understand. - Maybe the GPS device is broken or the batteries are too weak. - I checked everything this morning. We have to go this way. Come on. Trust me. - I've found it. We're here. This is the building. - Oh, thank God. - I can't walk another foot. Honestly. - A little creepy. - Hammer. - And you want to stay here? Are you sure? - First we have to find a way in. - What? Calm down. You shouldn't film this. - That was probably left by a hunter. - Hey! - There's no way I'm going in there. I won't stay there. - Hey Martin. Come here. I think I've found an entrance. - Martin, look. - You found a way in? - We'll see in a moment. And this is how we get in. Give me the action cam. - Just a second. - Okay, let's do this. Martin, I'll take the camera from you. So, I think we should find a place to make camp before we start exploring. - Yeah. Good idea. - Yeah. I think we should split into two groups. - Okay. - The hotel check-in desk. This is a desolate place for a hotel. - Locked. - Wow, we can each have our own room... Or not. - I don't think that's a good idea. We should stick together. - Alright. - Insane. How big is this place? You can get lost. - Indeed. - This is quite the hotel. We found the check-in desk. - George and I believe that too. The building is huge. - How do we find the next cache? This place has dozens of rooms, and that's not counting the basement. - This is cool. We have the whole place to ourselves. - We're gonna have to cuddle. It's so cold. - I think I can handle that. - You're already cold? - You've heard. - Help me! Ah, no no no. - So we're starting to explore now. We split into two groups and Martin is with us as reinforcement. So, let's go. - Yeah. - Eww. - Eww. - Eww. - It's good we brought enough food with us. - How do we find the next cache? - No clue. - Let's keep going. - Come. - Looks like they had a swimming pool. Too bad there's no water. - Let's keep moving. I'm scared. - Come. Hey, come. Boah! We scare the shit out of you! - Fucking idiots! What's wrong with you! - Oh, honey. - Hey Sarah. - Calm down. - Calm down. - Did you know about this? Shit. We're going alone. You can stay with these monkeys. - Sweetheart. Sarah, come on. You didn't find it funny? - I thought it was funny. - I found if funny too. - You too, Martin? Women. - Everything okay? - Yeah, I think so. - You know, I'm always here for you. - I know. - Idiots. What is that? Creepy. - A graveyard. - So many graves. - Don't you think that's strange? Out here in the middle of the forest? It gives me goosebumps. - Know what, I'll get the others. They have to see this. - Forget it. You're not leaving me here alone. - Yes. Yes. Okay, okay, okay. - That's impossible. That's my lucky charm. Look. I put it in the first cache. It can't be the same. It's a coincidence. - Funny coincidence. - Don't worry. Pendants like that are made in the millions in China. Come on. Let's go. - What's he doing? - He's installing some cameras in the hallways. - What good is that gonna do? - Well, it can't hurt. At least everything's covered. - I'm gonna take a look in here. - Eileen, come here. - A girl lived here. - Looks like it. - There's something else. The family was probably very religious. What is it? Can you read it? You know a little Polish, right? - "Grandma" Terrible. MOTHER... ME... FATHER - She drew her family. - Terrible. What can drive a kid to draw something like that? - What happened to this family? - Do you really want to know? - Oh man, I don't want to run into him in the dark. - Me neither. - And? - Fuck, can you take the camera? - Sure. - Okay, Got it. - Thanks - Hello handsome. Oh yeah. - Shit. - George. Come here. I found something. Oh, look at that. What went on here? - That's really scary. - We shouldn't tell the girls. They'll insist on leaving. - Definitely not. I think we should stop for the day. - Yeah. You're right. - Martin. - Thank you. - Sarah. Is everything okay? Come on, Sarah. - You took it with you. - Took what? - We found a child's drawings. They were very disturbing. - Show me. This is messed up. - And we still haven't found the treasure. Perhaps tomorrow. - Let's hope. - Hey wake up sunshine. - Go away. Leave me alone. - Oh, that's good. You're in a bad mood. Sweetheart. - Yeah? - Sarah's acting funny. Something's wrong. - Oh, she's probably still upset about yesterday. Don't stress. She'll come around. - Okay. - Mike. Come here. - What's up? - Take a look. I found something about this hotel. There's an article about the owners who used to live here. - Okay. - The parents of the family were religious fanatics. They believed their daughter was possessed by a demon and they tried to drive it out. And, yeah... They tortured her. - Oh my God. This explains the couches and straps we found in the basement. What happened next? - The girl died. They tortured her to death. - Shit What happened to her parents? - Her parents killed themselves. The bodies were found in their bed. The hotel was closed since then. - Shit. - Should we tell the girls? - Absolutely not. I don't want them to worry about this. We leave tomorrow anyway. We keep this to ourselves. - Okay. - Hey, what do you have? Find anything interesting? - We were looking at yesterday's footage. Yeah, there's some good footage. - Can I see? - Later. I have to change the battery. - Okay. - I'll keep watching. - So now it's around 10 PM. And we decided to stop exploring. This building is just too big. A labyrinth. To be honest... I'll be glad to get out of this horror hotel tomorrow. - Whoa... Shit. - I can't find them. - We have to find her. - Alright. I suggest forming two groups. Ali comes with me and Martin goes with George. - Okay. Let's go Martin. - Okay. I'll look up there. - That's really high. - I'm coming down. What was that? - Be careful. - Open the fucking door! - Hey, that's not funny. Open the door! What'll we do now? - Watch out for the camera. - Sorry What's this? - Blood. - Shit. Maybe Sarah's hurt. Sarah. - I want to go home. - Me too. - When we find Sarah, we leave tomorrow morning. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm scared shitless. - I've had enough as well. We should have left after George found out about the hotel. - Found out what? - Some family that tortured their daughter here... - You're telling me this now? Are you crazy? - I'm sorry. What was that? Shit. - Who's there? - Be careful. Okay. Let's go, but carefully. - What was that? Last time I'm staying at a hotel. Oh man. Shit. What the hell is that? Sarah. Sarah. Sarah? What's wrong? Sarah? Crap. Go faster. George. George. - Where's George? - I thought he was behind me. - What about Sarah? - Sarah? Sarah... Changed somehow. - What happened? - I don't know. She turned into a monster. - Monster? Come on, we have to find them now. We're not leaving without her. - Forget it. - Martin, show me the way. - I'm not going back there. - Martin, please. Please, show us where she was. - Oh, shit. What happened here? - God. - Guys, we have to find George. He lost a lot of blood. - This is Sarah's rosary. That came from over there. - George? - Where are you? - George. - George. Sarah. What's that? - No idea. I think it came from there. - Sarah? What's happening to you? Let me help you. God. Mom. God. Help. Help. Oh God... Oh God... Help! Help! No! Mike! - Martin. Martin. - No! - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - You can't do anything about it. This is all my fault. I can't run anymore. Please get to safety. - I won't leave you here alone. - Run away. Please. - Mike. - Mike. You can't leave me alone now. Please. Mom. Dad. - If you see this, I may already be dead. I love you. - There definitely seems to be people here. Look... Here's a camera. Why is this here? Well, show me what you've got, my movie star. - Good? - A little sexy please. - What was that? - No idea.
