Hey. Hey, wake up. Come on, get your stuff together. We're going on a vacation. What about Papa? Honey, we don't really have time right now. But you promised. If you promise to finish packing quietly, we'll go see your dad. Okay? Come on, let's go. Look, sweetie. Don't be disappointed if your father isn't home. Remember how I told you sometimes he has to go back home to Mexico, even if he doesn't want to? Well, he might not be here. Alright? What are you doing here? Mom said we're going on vacation. Vacation? Where? What do you care, cabron? It's not like you ever come around. I told you I have to work, what do you want me to do? Mom said we're going to New Mexico. We're gonna meet her new friend. Hey. Hey, listen, I gotta go. I'm so sorry. You gonna like New Mexico, hey? It's very pretty. We're just going there on vacation. Hey, you gonna be strong, okay? Emilio. When can I see you again? You be a better man than me, okay, Emilio? Papa. Hey Frank, open up, it's me. Come on! Gina? I thought you were coming next week. Well, surprise, I came early. Oh, I gotta work in the morning. Are you happy to see me or not? Alright, alright, of course I'm happy to see you. Good. I want you to meet somebody. This is Emilio. How you doin'? Come on, what do you say? Hi. Well, let's get inside. It's cold out here. You want some breakfast? Okay. I don't like beans. It's all we got. Eat up if you're gonna, I got somethin' out in the shop I wanna show ya. Right there. This is what you're gonna do. See this brush? You're gonna dip it in the gasoline and you're gonna scrub. See how that grease comes off? Now, this is for a big customer, so all of this has got to be spotless, okay? Spotless. Why do I have to do it? 'Cause I don't give no free rides, kid. My mom knows how to do this. Well, this ain't your mom's house now, is it? Why do I have to do this? I don't wanna live here. When can we go home? We can't. So, I need you to try and make the best of it. I wanna go home. I wanna see Poppy again. We can't do that right now, okay? I wanna go home. Sweetie, why don't you go into the bathroom and wash up? Emilio. Emilio, honey. Honey, are you okay/. Nice, real nice. There's nothing to be sad about, okay? It's gonna be alright. Still awake, huh? Good, 'cause there's something I need to tell ya. I really like your mom. It's been a long time since I've had a woman around here. Well, anyway, this thing between me and your mom, it ain't gonna change. So, I'm gonna make you a deal. You're gonna stop begging your mommy to take you home, and I'm gonna forget all about that little remodel you did in my bathroom today. Understand? Yeah. Hey. Hey. You're Emilio, right? Yeah. Everyone at school says that you're a little dumb. I'm not dumb! You don't look that dumb to me. I'm Sandy, I live next door to you. You live in the gas station, right? Yeah. Oh. I met your dad, he was really nice. He's not my dad. Oh. Well, I thought he was. He's just my mom's friend, and, we're not gonna stay there for long. Just for a while. Okay. Hey. How's it going? Okay. I'm almost finished. Well, good. Well, Frank will be home soon, and then we can close up here and go in and watch some television or something. Okay? I know it's been a long day. Hey, boys. Oh, my. Woo! Hey there. My, my, my. You look good coming and going. Hey, hey, hey! You should come with us to this, uh, this little party we're going to. I've gotta work. Oh, come on, it'll be fun. A little party. That's alright. Why not? I've got my kid here, for starters. I'm not just gonna leave him. Bring him! I'm not gonna bring my kid to a party, alright? Oh? Why not? You know, we'll have some beers, we'll hang out. You know? It'll be fun, just you and me. Seriously, I'm just gonna finish up here and I'm done for the night. It'll be fun. Come on, man, we gonna go to this party or not? Come here, you know, you look so hot tonight. Stop it, get off of me! Hey! What the hell? Knock it off, you little! Stop, what are you doing? Knock it off, kid! Get that kid away from... Baby, what's wrong? What's wrong, what happened? Jesus, baby. I thought they were hurting you. Okay. I think I've got enough details here to file a report on them, Gina. And you. No more attacking cars, okay? You're lucky nobody got hurt. Hey, Shane, listen. Don't file anything on those guys, alright? Sal's a good customer. So his kid got a little rowdy with Gina. She's a fine piece of ass, you know. You can't blame him. Alright. Thanks. So, um, Sal's pretty upset, huh? Well, he wasn't happy about it. One of the things you got going for ya, though, is Ricky and his old man aren't gettin' along too well these days. So, it's probably a good idea if you try and fix the kid's car. I mean, especially if he's one of your best customers. Christ, like I got time for that. Yeah, I know, it's just a good idea. And do me a favor, call Mom. She's driving me nuts, she says you never call her anymore. Keep an eye out on that kid. I saw the damage he did on the car, and it's just not normal for somebody his size. And when you jump off, it's like a thousand foot... I mean, it's a thousand feet into a pit. Don't throw such a big rock. Sandy. You're late. I was startin' to worry about ya. Who's this? Emilio. Emilio, huh? Well, now, you go on home there, Emilio. I'm sure you're folks are worried about you, too. Sandy has a lot of work to do tonight. Bye, Emilio. Bye, Sandy. Now, don't make a fuss, dear. You know our little game's a secret. I've seen your mom's boobs. Yeah, sure, retard. I have too. Uh-huh, sure, prove it! Emilio. Hey. Can you come outside? Nah, my grandma won't let me. Climb out the window. What? He won't see you. Come on, it's okay. Wow, I've never snuck out like this before. Ever. We can do whatever we want. And the best part is, my stupid grandpa doesn't know anything. Hey, retard! Just ignore them. Yeah, that's what I usually do. Why did you call your grandpa stupid? He seemed pretty nice to me. I don't really wanna talk about it. I wish Frank was like him. I said I don't wanna talk about him. What? Why do you have to be so stupid, Emilio? Emilio, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Hey, look, the retard's got a girlfriend! Hey, retard. You like those retards? Oh, it the retard gonna cry now? Oh yeah, come on retard, cry. What a pussy. Come on, retard, kiss your girlfriend. Yeah, come on, kiss her, retard. Come on, retard. Emilio! Emilio! Emilio, stop! Alright, break it up! You alright, kid? Look, I'll take you to the clinic, okay? You can call your folks from there. Alright, come on. Here. Now, this will cover the bruise. I'm gonna be in so much trouble. Yeah. Me too. I'm sorry I pushed you. It's okay. Maybe we should run away. Yeah. And, we could go anywhere we wanted, and we wouldn't ever have to go home. Ever. Yeah. Oh my God, oh my God. Honey, what happened? He's fine. What happened? I'll tell you later. Right now, he's going to his room. Right now! Why didn't you tell me your kid was a spaz? There's nothing wrong with my kid. He was wailin' on the other kid. I had to drag him off, or he would've killed him. What are you talking about? Do not talk to me about my child. He would've killed that kid. No he would not have. No, he wouldn't. Sandy. Sandy! Why don't you come sleep with grandpa tonight, honey. Come on. That's my girl. What else could you ask for? A little tiny bit. Hi, baby. Come here. Frankie was just telling me how impressed he was with your running today. You got some set of wheels, kid. Tell him about your plans. Oh, yeah! It's gonna be big. This is gonna be a busy year. I'm gonna put diesel pumps in, right here. The electronic kind, so the customers can use their credit cards. And once we get the diesel pumps, we'll get the truckers from the interstate. And then the lot lizards will come in, and don't you be jealous, baby. Because you're the one I want. Turn on the heat, Emilio, turn it on! That's it, kid. Come on, bring it home! Good job, guys. Nice kick, Kelly, let's go! Walk around, keep loose. 4:08. Good, kid. That was a smokin' 1,600. Nice kick at the end. Let's stretch it up! Come on, guys, stretch it up, keep loose. Emilio. Emilio, slow down a second. What are you doing out here? I don't know. Part of your training is knowing how to take care of yourself. Letting your body rest, too. You've trained enough today. The rest of the team went home an hour ago. I know, I know, I know. I just thought I'd get a couple more laps in. That's all, coach. Don't worry, we're gonna have practice again tomorrow. Okay. Stretch. So, don't forget who's taking you home, 'cause I'm the one you wanna meet. So, darlin', save the last dance for me. Come on, dance with me, baby. Get off me, Frank, I don't want to. They were playin' our song tonight. I can smell her on you, Frank. What are you talkin' about? Forget it. Come on, Sandy. Are you comin'? I'm coming. Why you always gotta take so long. I just do, okay. Yeah. But, I've been waiting here for like ten minutes. You look hot. How you doin' there, Emilio? Hey. Feelin' alright? Yeah. That's good, 'cause you got a big meet comin' up in a month. I know. Actually, I don't think you do. See, I pulled some strings and I got a scout comin' out here. Really? Yup, and he's lookin' for people to give scholarships to. And he's comin' to see you. I really talked you up. That's cool. That's cool? Don't blow it off like that. Hey, look at me. This is it, this is your shot. I went to bat for you. I know. Alright, what's on your mind, huh? You havin' problems at home? Hmm? Girl problems, what? Look, whatever it is, Emilio, you gotta keep it off that track. When you're out there, you gotta focus on... I know! There is no reason for you to get upset. I'm not. I didn't say you were. I am just trying to... Where you goin'? Huh? Hey, Emilio, I'm talkin' to you. Emilio! Hey, kid, nice of you to come home once in a while. Sorry I'm late. Get your work clothes on. Hey, sweetie. Got the parts out in the shop. Need 'em cleaned up by tomorrow. You can't work him tonight. It's our first job in weeks, I'm not gonna turn it down. But he has school tomorrow, and he's been training all afternoon. Look at him, he's exhausted. Oh yeah, he's not the only one all tired from a hard day's work. Working doesn't include screwing the waitress from the diner, Frank. That's not work. You know what? Don't come at me with this shit now, alright? Why not? Right now's not a good time for you. I'm sorry, maybe I'll come back when it's a little more convenient. You wanna eat tomorrow night, huh? You know how much food this kid of yours goes through in a week? Maybe if you paid a little more attention to this station, rather than what's her name, things would be a little bit easier. Mom, it's okay. Come on. Need those done by tomorrow. Hey, so, when did you hook up with Sandy? I don't know. I never really talked to her much. Then she starts comin' on to me one night at this party. Yeah? I hear she's an effing stallion, dude. A real fuck horse, you know? Yeah, a goddamn hurricane. You're handing out sloppy seconds. Psycho! You alright, Mckenning? Let me look at you. Retard! Goddammit, what the hell was that all about? Has John been hasslin' you? No. Really? 'Cause most people don't get that pissed off unless they've been hassled. He wasn't. You know, I am bound by school policy to report all incidents of violence. How that's gonna affect your school records, I'm not sure. I'm also not sure how it's gonna affect your eligibility for the track team. Look. I'll make a deal with you, kid. You see the psychiatrist that comes to this school once a month, and I'll see if I can pull some strings and keep you on the team. How's that? Alright, now get the hell out of here before I change my mind. I don't know what else to do. I said I'll figure it out. Hi, honey. Would you move, please. You think your little waitress friend is still gonna wanna screw you when you're livin' out on the street, huh? I'm not screwing anybody! I already told you, so get off my back. I'm talkin' about money, Frank, and you're not makin' any. Yeah, well you nagging me all the time ain't makin' us any money either. So, shut up, fatass. What did you call me? You heard me. 20 years, I've been runnin' this station and supportin' you and your kid for 10 of 'em. The least you can do is keep yourself together and maybe service your man after a hard day's work. Emilio. Hey. Hey, wake up. Honey, it's two o'clock in the morning. You should go back to your own bed. Me and Frank are done for the night. I'm sorry you had to hear all that. It's just the station isn't doing so good. I know, mom. I know. It's strange. I don't know what we'd do if this dump went out of business. Or what I'd do. Can I tell you a secret? I applied for a job yesterday. Really? It's not much, but, it'll help until we can turn things around. Honey, you're exhausted. You should go to bed. Why? Jerk. The boy walks like Popeye. Err. Are you guys going to class later. I remember you from the clinic when you were younger. Okay, let's see. Coach Marquez tells me you were in a fight earlier this week. Do you wanna tell me about it? Sorry, hang on. Yes, Mrs. Welsh. Yes, well, I'm with a student right now, and... Yes, I will. These should help control the anger. Here. Take one every morning. Hey, honey, you're home early. I didn't feel like going to practice, today. Oh, okay. What's wrong? Nothing. Hey, I got that job. Really? So, why aren't you happy? I just told Frank about it. I guess he's not too happy for some reason. You want something to eat? Sure. I mean, I finally find a way to get us out of this hole we're in, and I just think he's gonna be happy, you know? Instead, he just goes ballistic. Mom... I mean, what does he expect me to do? Just lie around here until we get thrown out onto the street? Maybe I'll just forget about the whole thing. Mom, there's something I have to tell you. What? They gave me this today at school. They said I have to start taking it. Pills, why? Because I got into a fight. A fight? Honey, what happened? Nothin'. Just a fight. I don't think you need to be taking... Look, I have to take them. If I don't take them, they said I can't be on the track team. These pills look expensive. Fuck Frank. I guess I'm gonna take that job. Come on, you turtles, let's hustle up! Let's keep up that pace. Come on, Kelley, come on. Move it, Emilio, pick it up, man. Pick it up, Emilio. Alright, guys, good job. Practice is over, let's get back. You wanna tell me what the problem out there is. You should've smoked those guys. Nothin'. Nothin'. Get out of your head. See you guys tomorrow, that's it. Hey. Hey. How's John? What do you care, didn't you try to kill him? I didn't mean to. You didn't mean to? What's that supposed to mean. I guess I just got a little mad. Just get out of here. Look. I take these now. So, I won't get angry anymore. Yeah? I can't believe they gave these to you. Kinda weird. You should take them with a little vodka. Well, um... I gotta go. Sandy? Sandy. What are you doing here? We used to talk like this all the time, remember? Yeah, when we were kids. Yeah. I'm sorry. You're right, this is stupid. Sandy! Come on, help your grandpa here! I gotta go. Hey, I just wanted to ask you... I just wanted to ask you if you were, uh, if you were gonna be going to the dance on Friday night. What, the Sadie Hawkins? Yeah. I don't know. Me and John might go and hang out there a while, just to check it out. Oh, you and John? Yeah, why, are you going? I don't know. Probably not, it's just some dumb dance. Mm hmm. Yeah. Well, I mean if, you do end up going, you wanna bring those meds with you? Yeah, sure. Awesome. Sandy! I'm in pain here. I gotta go. Alright, Emilio, 1,600, that's you. Get 'em, kid. On your marks. Set. Go, kid, go! Come on, Emilio, where's the fire? Come on, kick, kick, kick! Come on, Emilio, bring it in! Hey. What's going on with you? Usually you smoke those guys. It's nothin'. Nothin'? You could beat every one of those kids on one foot. Listen to me, I think you could run a real fast 1,600. Maybe a four minute. Is there something you wanna talk to me about? I wish I could, but, it's nothing you can help me with. Look, I know it can be rough on you kids, that's why I'm fightin' for you. This is your shot. To get out. You're a good kid, and I don't wanna see you blow this chance. Thanks, Coach. Two weeks. You got two weeks before the big meet. Clear your head, understand? I'll be alright. This drunk guy, he just comes out of a bar and he's walkin' home. He looks up, and he sees his wife waitin' for him at the door. He looks to the duck and he says, uh, "This is the pig that I've been sleepin' with." His wife says, "That's a duck." He says, "I was taklin' to the duck." I saw that comin'. Hey, Emilio, what's goin' on? Hey, where the hell have you been? My track meet. You're supposed to be watching the station. Haven't been anybody here for hours. Who knows how much business we lost. But you always know I'm at track meets on Saturday. I don't care about your track meets. Only think I care about is making sure this station doesn't... You know what? As of tonight, you're done with track. What? You can't make me quit... Hey! Don't you tell me what I can't do in my own house. You sleep in my bed, you eat my food, you follow my rules. But, I don't wanna quit. Hey! End of discussion. Now there's work for ya in the shop. Did I miss anything? Nothin'. He gonna be alright? Sandy. Sandy. Hey, Emilio. Sandy, what the fuck are you doing? Trust me. Hey. Hey. You, um, got those meds on you? Yeah. Can I try one? I really don't think I'm supposed to... Come on! Emilio. I have an idea. Why don't you hang out with us? Sandy. - Okay. - Sandy. Shit. I'm gonna give one to John. To, um, lighten up his mood. Man, let's get out of here. This dance looks like it blows. Yeah, let's blow some pills up our butts. Yeah, I kill. Emilio. Thanks. You want some? Yeah, give me like, five. Here, just take them. I don't wanna feed 'em to you. Hey, uh, psycho. Julio. Where'd you get these pills? Open up, open up. Give me one more. Hey, psycho, give me one more. Hey, one more. Hey there. Are you okay? Mm. Sandy, I wanna tell you somethin'. Yeah? What? That I, uh... That I've always kind of liked you. Even when we were kids. I like you too. I'm going to tell you a secret. I remember when we were little kids, that we used to hang out. It was so much fun, you know. You, Emilio, have not changed one bit. Did you know that? I hope you never do. Why do you go out with John? He's such a jerk. I don't know. Don't you ever wanna leave this town, like we talked about when we were kids? Emilio, I gave that up a long time ago. But I know a way that I think we could, we could make it happen. I mean, you could maybe come with me if I was to get a scholarship, you know, and, and then, Sandy? Sandy? You slut. Hey, mom. Seems like you had a good night. Yeah, it went alright. Aren't you supposed to be at work already? I figured I'd call in sick today. Don't make too big a deal of it, Emilio. Emilio, I just slipped when we were arguing. It got a little out of control. Emilio! Emilio, listen. Baby. I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, it's my fault. It's not your fault. Sorry. Sorry. It's my fault, mom. It's about time. Marshall, Kelley, I'm switching you guys up in the 400 on Saturday, alright? Nice job today. Sorry I'm late, coach. Yeah, well, I'm not sure what that's worth now. You missed the whole practice. Alright guys, good hustle, back to the lockers. But, I need a place to stay, John. I can't pay the rent there. I have nowhere else to go. No way, you're not stayin' with me. I saw you comin' on to him at the bluffs. Don't lie to me. You're an asshole. Worthless! Sandy. Sandy. Sandy. Hey, uh, have you seen Sandy? Try the bar on Union. She's been hanging out there lately. Thanks. I don't think so. I'm just looking for someone. Make sure that's all you do. I think she deserves a reward. I think she does. You ever had, uh, a tour of the bar? Maybe the VIP room?

Well, maybe I don't need any of your help. Did you ever think about that? But, I'm the only one who knows you. I'm the only one who knows that this isn't you, Sandy. What do you know about it, Emilio? I promised to get you out of here. Screw you! I don't wanna leave this. Maybe this helps me forget how screwed up everything is, okay? What? I'm never gonna give up on you. You're ruining your life. That is all I need, is a retard telling me. You know your stupid dreams? They're never going to happen. And I know all you ever wanted was to screw me like every other guy. Come on, cop a feel. Go for it! It's not true. Welcome to the South Mesa Plains. Invitational Track Meet, folks.

Yes. Thank you. Hi, honey. Hey. You want some breakfast? Oh, no, I'm okay. Have a seat. Don't feel unwelcome because of Frank. Don't let him get to you, he's just going through a tough time right now. Oh yeah? I didn't realize my private affairs were everyone's business. So, who's this? This is Sandy. I told you about her last night, remember? You didn't tell me anything. So, you Emilio's girlfriend? She's just my friend. Yeah, I bet. I wish I had friends as good lookin' as you.

I mean, coach for me $1,000 just to get out there. I already made it to the bank and cashed it. Cool. Hey, Emilio. Come here. Okay, mom. Um. Actually, Sandy. Actually, I wanted to ask you a question. I was gonna see if maybe you, um... If you'd think about maybe... If you might come to Oregon with me. Come on, come over here. Okay, mom, just one second, okay? What do you say, Sandy?

You are lucky you're gonna make it to prison alive, boy. Shane! Shane, what are you doin'? Goddammit, Shane. He killed Frank. What? He fuckin' killed Frank, Frank is dead in there. Oh my God. Where's Gina? I gotta tell Gina, oh my God. Go get Gina. You fuckin' stay here. Sandy, are you okay? Yeah. Sorry. Don't be. What you did in there for me. I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I didn't. I know. What's gonna happen to you? I don't know. I don't know, but I don't think Shane's gonna let me go to Oregon now. No, probably not. Do you still wanna go? What? I mean, go with me. I mean, if I was still gonna go. Would you wanna go with me? I don't know. I mean, it's crazy, but, I think I would have. Because we still can. What? Look. What, you mean? If Shane comes and takes me away right now, I can never come back. Never. But if we go right now. We'll get in trouble. Trouble? Sandy, I really can't get in much more trouble than this. I mean, think about it. I mean, you used to get in trouble when you were a little girl. You crawled out of your window, remember? So, let's do it. What do you say? Come on, let's do it. Okay. Oh my God! We're out of gas. We're out of gas! We're gonna make it to a gas station, okay? Okay? Okay. - We're out of gas. - It's okay. It's okay, just pull off the road. Look here. I'm gonna try and go get us some gasoline. You're not going to leave me here. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'll be okay. I think maybe we should just rest up a bit, okay? You're cold. Pop the trunk, and I'll try to find us somethin' warm, okay? Look what I found. I got us a flashlight. And some water and towels to clean up with. Here's your blanket. What are we gonna do tomorrow? I don't know. It's weird. I get this feeling that I'm never going to see that town again. And that, I never thought in a million years that I'd be leaving with you. I did. Sandy? Sandy? Sandy. Hey. What's wrong? Sorry. It's just everything kind of hit me this morning. You know, I mean, everything that happened last night and yesterday. Things have happened so fast. Just tell me where we're going, Emilio. I was thinking maybe we could go stay with my dad. My read dad. He lives down in Mexico. Would he be cool with that? Yeah, he's real cool. I mean, he was when I was a kid. So, you haven't talked to him since you were a kid. It sounds nice. I remember the last time I saw him. He didn't know what to say to me. He asked, "How do you sum up a life in 10 seconds?" But, I think you can. I think what you did last night, when we took off, was just that. Emilio! Oh my God! Come on! Emilio! Maybe we should just turn ourselves in. It's okay. No, no way. It's okay, it's okay. Look, look, maybe we should try and get in that camper. But he'll see us. No, he's gonna see me, not you. Here, take this. Just take this, look. When I run that way, he's gonna chase after me, and, when he does, I want you to go over there and get in that camper, okay? How are you gonna do that? Look, don't worry about it, Sandy, I'll get there. You just go, okay? Emilio, don't do this! Emilio! Let's just give up. No way. No way. I love you. I love you. Emilio! Jesus. Emilio! Emilio, I'll shoot. I will! Get in the car. Dammit. Sandy, don't move. Dammit. This is Officer Shane Holstein. Suspect down.
