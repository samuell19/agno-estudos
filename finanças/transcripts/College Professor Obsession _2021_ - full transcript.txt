Give me the phone. No! No, no! [Screams] [Girl screams] Man on phone: Have you had a chance to look over the spreadsheets? Steven: Yeah. Those numbers look good. Man on phone: What about your flight? Yeah, I'm on the 10:15 flight tomorrow morning. You have me through the weekend? Man on phone: Yeah. Yeah. Man on phone: Be ready. Okay. Man on phone: It's gonna be a long one. Hi. Lookin' strong, kiddo. Feeling strong, daddy-o. It just stiffens up on me sometimes. Man on phone: Hey, be sure to send over your report. Steven yes, sir. Jenny: Hey. Hey. Leg hurt? Not as much as losing my scholarship. Are you rushing it? Mom, I've been babying it all summer. If I'm gonna get my scholarship back, I have to start training again. (Squealing) My baby's going off to college. (Laughs) Please don't gush. Ah! Give me a hug. Don't. Come on! I'm an empty nester now. Gimme a break. I love you. Love you. Let me help you pack. Okay. I need it. This is really beautiful, mom. All my favorites. We thought you'd enjoy one last home cooked meal before dorm food. Absolutely. To our brave and beautiful Jen Jen. We love you so much. Scholarship or not. You'll never disappoint us. Now don't party too much and flunk all your classes. Um... like I flunked stand-up comedy? Kristen: What's wrong? No, it's just I'm nervous about the move. 30 miles. You'll be home to do your laundry on the weekends. It's not the distance. It's not even that it's my first time being away from home. It's dorms. Roommates. What if I don't like them? What if they don't like me? I lived in the dorms in college. I met your dad in the dorms. Made friends. Like Linda. It'll be great. You'll see. Here. Lemme get that. Thank you. Anything else? No. That's it. Oh! I'm gonna cry. Please don't. I'm gonna tell a joke. Oh! Please don't. Have fun. You too. Love ya, kiddo. I love you. Good luck. - Bye. - Have fun. Let's go. ♪ So exciting! Gosh, it's so big. I'm gonna get lost. You won't get lost. We don't get a lot of new students after winter break, but we're glad to have some new faces. This is our dining hall. You'll spend a lot of time here. (Kristen chuckles) If you're used to a high school cafeteria, you'll recognize the abundance of starches and carbohydrates. But don't worry, every 5000 calorie meal is topped off at the all-you-can-eat snack bar, which I invite you to partake of now. Alright. Did they have this when you lived in the dorms? Oh, yeah. I gained the freshman fifteen. Ice cream here, and my campus job is at the smoothie shop. Forget it. You'll be training again. You'll need all these scrumptious calories. So, the tour guide. Articulate with a hint of sarcasm? Hmm? Mom, don't "hmm" me over every guy we see. Okay, not every guy, but what about that one? Stop. He's cute. Okay, you're embarrassing me. [Elevator rings] Anyone for floor 11? I'm also on 12. Oh, penthouse. (Chuckles) I'm the floor RA. "Resident assistant." The school feels more comfortable trusting the welfare of irresponsible freshman to equally irresponsible grad students. Just kidding. Sort of. This is the bathroom. What? You've never seen a co-ed bathroom before? No. Everyone's a jokester. Let's see where you are. 1227? What? Um... uh, nothing. It's right down here. That was weird, right? Like my room leads into a Stephen King novel? No. No, no, no. It was weird. Uh, here it is. 1227. Let me know if you need anything. [Knock on door] Hello. 1227, a little bit o' heaven. I'm Beth. Come in. Jenny. Jenny Willis. And my mom. Hi. I'm Kristen. And that's sour Sarah. Ignore her, and she'll do the same. She'll even ignore you if you don't. But don't worry, I'm friendly enough for the both of us. That's your bed. And your desk. Not claustrophobic, are you? Uh, not yet. Right? The double rooms are even smaller. The triples are a trade off. We get a little extra floor space, even though the bunk doesn't take up that much more room. Beth. What? She's gonna sleep in that bed whether you like it or not. What's wrong with her? Sorry about her. She warms up once you get to know her. Oh, wait... No. She doesn't. What made her so upset? She was really fond of our last roommate, Elaine. But there'll be time for all that later. We have you now! Where's all your stuff? It's in the car. - Let's go get it. - Okay. Okay, when you're done, let's meet in the cafeteria. Yeah, I usually just skip this whole section and go straight to the veggies. Only thing worse than the freshman fifteen is the sophomore sixty. Sixty? Girls come in here wanting to be models and by Christmas they're made out of Clay. What's up, toppers? Toppers? Top floor. Meet Jenny. My new lower. Hi. You got Elaine's bed? Everyone, stop. You didn't tell her? You have to tell her? What? Tell me what? Lot of returning students had a party last week. Last rager before classes start. And Elaine well, everyone was having fun, but it was loud. So, she went to the roof to get some air and she... She what? She fell. She fell? She died. Your last roommate fell off the roof and died at the party last weekend? And I'm sleeping in her bed? [Cell phone rings] Hey. Steven: Hi. Kristen (on phone) I love that you're working so hard to keep Jenny in private school. How's it going? It's still going. How's it going with you? Horrible. I left her at 1:00, and she still hasn't called. Steven: It's only 5:00. Uh, yeah, I know, but it feels like a lifetime. Why don't you call her? No. I know you, you're gonna worry about her until you call her. I don't want to bug her. You're not gonna be able to fall asleep until you call her. Just call her. Alright, well, I gotta get back in this meeting. I love you. Okay? Bye. If you believe she fell. Michelle. I'm just saying. Elaine bombed last year. Her grades went from like A’s to C’s and D’s, and there's a rumor going around that she didn't fall from the balcony. She jumped. She jumped? Enough, Michelle. [Cell phone rings] Honey, what's wrong? The girl who was in my bed last semester died. That girl died? Are you kidding? I know. It's so horrible. I'm coming to get you right now, okay? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. You can't live in the dorms. You can't. You can commute. An hour each way? Yes, you can! I know. But I can't just run away on my first day. Besides, I have to be on the track in the afternoon. I'm coming to get you. Okay? A girl died. Mom, it's okay. I'm okay. I'll call you later. No, Jen Jen. You have to come home. Jenny: You won't understand, mom. Jenny? Sorry. I-I didn't mean to... Jenny: No! I-I don't know why I'm so upset. I mean, you guys are the ones that knew her. Because you have to sleep in her bed. Hey, babe. Stop, Dane. Dane! Seriously, leave me alone. That is not what you were saying all last year. That's right, last year. So, by now you should accept that it's never going to happen again. Never say never. Hey! I want my dorm room key. Hey! Are you okay? Should we call security? Don't bother. I'm sure it was Dane. Dane? Whoever it was, I got him really good on the shoulder. I gave him a key back when we were dating, and he never gave it back. Said he'd keep it for when I "came around." I just never thought he'd use it. Probably trying to steal my panties! Take off your shirt! I knew you'd come around eventually. Oh, god! What is going on? Someone broke into our room. I cut his shoulder. And you think that I’m... Give me my key. I was just hoping that we would be able to... Leave me alone. I didn't go into your room. I wouldn't do that. You're both all right? Anything uh, missing or stolen? Only our sense of safety and security. You're doing a bang-up job, "R.A." First Elaine, now this. I-I'm... I'm sorry. I'll put in a req to have the key re-lock... The, uh, the lock re-keyed. How long does that take? (Sighs) A couple of days. (Scoffs) We'll sleep real soundly until then. Kinda hard on him. He's lucky I didn't sting him harder. Beth, the guy... The guy in here, I mean, he was... He was looking for something. You know, I'm still not convinced it wasn't Dane. He's got a whole... No. He wasn't just looking for panties, Beth. I mean, he... He was really looking for something. Do you think that it could have been about Elaine? Elaine? I don't know. Does she have any stuff still here? Her parents took it all. It's just weird, you know? A week ago, she dies and now someone breaks in? Maybe... Maybe she didn't jump or fall. Maybe she was murdered. No. The police were here. They questioned everyone. There was twenty people in the hall, and no one saw anyone. But you said it was a party. I mean, no one was probably paying attention? Did anyone not like her? Was there a guy that she dumped? Everyone liked Elaine. And I never even saw her date. She wasn't killed, Jenny. I mean, the police said I it was an accident. She fell. And time to walk on eggshells. I'm gonna take a shower. Thanks for shopping at blush. Thank you. Have a nice day, ladies. Thank you. Died? A student died? Yeah. And Jen is sleeping in her bed? Can I make her move home? Oh, I want her to move home. At 18? How's that gonna work? I don't know. And how does someone spend two decades of their life trying to keep their kid safe, only to have them move away and not be able to protect them anymore? I have two under ten, and I cannot wait until they're both out of the house and have to keep themselves alive. Oh, no, you say that now, and then they're gone, and all you can think about is how you've totally lost your purpose. ♪ Jenny. Worst first night in the dorms ever, huh? Coulda been worse. You could've been stuck in a double only with Sarah. Come on. When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping! My treat. [Elevator rings] Do you like it? I wouldn't be caught dead in that outfit, but I admire your fire. I bet you're the first to raise your hand for every question, aren't you? Jenny: Can we slow down? Oh, my campus job. Really? Yeah. Mangoberry is the best. Come on. First one's on me. Okay. Ow! What's wrong? Sorry, uh, hit a rock on the road of life. Okay. I'm good. My leg is acting up today. Coach Simmons: Not bad. Coach Simmons. You set a pace for about a 17, 18 second 100 meter. Great. That would've gotten me sixth place at the church picnic. Even a church picnicker couldn't hit 18 seconds with a torn acl. I'm sorry about the scholarship, Jenny. It wasn't my call. It's okay. Gotta give the money to someone who can run. So, I'm gonna run, coach. I'm gonna run my way back into my scholarship. When'd you get up, two hours ago? I didn't know the first day of classes was such a special occasion. Every day is. I feel my best when I look my best. Her grades were way down last year. College isn't for everyone. How are you gonna walk in those all day? Beautifully. Professor: I'll do it. Honestly, Kyle, if your assistance is going to create more hindrance than help, I will find myself another T.A. Yes... sir. Good morning. Good morning! This is American history 101. If this is not the class you're supposed to be in, too bad you're stuck here until I'm done in 50 minutes. Where does American history begin? N... This is a lecture, young lady. Not a town hall. The questions are rhetorical. Kyle! Hey. Jenny. Yeah, I saw you in there. You got a nip from old Harrington. Guess I asked for it though. You didn't. Ah, others are worse. If you just let him listen to himself talk, you'll be all right. How are you after the other night? Okay, I guess. Sorry Beth was so hard on you. She was just scared. Hey, it's my job to keep all the students on my floor safe. And I failed. Twice now. I asked for a rush on that new lock. Thanks. [Thud] You all jumped when I came into the room? Why? Come on. This was in your pre-term reading. A loud noise startles you. Is the reaction physiological or psychological? It's both. Our brains instinctively interpret loud noises as potentially dangerous. Then signal our bodies to prepare for the threat. By jumping out of your skin? [Laughter] Don't laugh. She's right. Brain and body together determine how we interpret and react to our environment. We want to examine which is responsible for what? What is instinct, as miss? Willis. Jenny Willis. Jennifer. Yeah. Jenny. That's a lotta names. As miss Willis has noted. And what is a learned, emotional response? I am Dr. Davrow. Welcome to my class. Dr. Davrow: Thank you, everyone. We'll see you tomorrow. Dr. Davrow (cont.) Miss Willis? May I have a word? Miss Willis? Freshman? Very bold. Most students would rather stick their arm in a lion's cage than in the air on the first day of class. I-I don't mind standing out. University is more competitive than high school. Even the bold have to up their game if they want to stand out. I look forward to seeing your paper. [Heavy bass music plays] Hey. Okay, that's enough. Headphones off! Look, I'm not gonna sleep four feet from you for the next semester and never have you say hello. Hello. You don't even know me. You have no reason not to like me. Well, stealing my book and my phone seem like pretty good reasons. I didn't... Okay, fine. Here. I don't dislike you. I dislike Beth. Why? Beth's nice. Beth is as fake as twenty dollar Prada. She wakes up every morning, and she hides behind those dresses because she's too afraid to succeed in this world as what she really is. I'm sorry for ignoring you. Whatever, but I'm not going to fake nice just because. So I have to choose between you two? No, Jenny. I chose. Kyle? What happened? Uh... professor Harrington. He, uh... Heart attack. Thank you very much. Everything okay, miss Willis? Let's take a look at your paper. My paper? Yes. The assignment. You completed it, right? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Here. You're gonna have to work harder than that to stand out. Okay. Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. What was that? Dr. Davrow. Excuse me? My students address me as "Dr. Davrow." Or "professor." It's an honorific that shows respect. Well, you get respect by showing it to others. Hmm? Where'd you learn that? Some book about the great lessons of kindergarten? University is harder, Jenny. Consider it a lesson. In what, humiliation? In rising to the challenge. And you start by putting yourself together. This outfit, I don't know what you call it. Frumpy tracksuit? You can do better. How dare you! I dare because I care. You see, I can quote pithy aphorisms, too. So you're saying you graded me down because of my clothes? No, I graded you down because your paper was rushed, ill-conceived and subpar for my class. And I'm pointing out to you that going through life looking like you slept in an alleyway, you'll find, repels rather than attracts people who might be in a position to help you. Which I could, if you show me you're worthy. He did it in front of everyone. It was horrifying. What, the paper or him telling you to dress nicer? Both! Totally inappropriate! What? I don't know about the paper, but as for the clothes, I told you I wouldn't be caught dead in... Okay, "looking your best to feel your best" is different than dressing up to get grades you should be getting based on your work. And if your work can only get you so far? I don't claim to be a unicorn, Jenny. I know my merits. (Scoffs) Are you saying that... To get grades? Beth, why, why would you... What? You've never batted your lashes at a traffic cop to get out of a speeding ticket? Jenny no! Flirted with the bouncer to get past the line at a club? Whatever. It's not like I was failing. I wore a nice dress and heels to Davrow's class and got an "a" where I might have gotten a "B." What about the girls who don't have a nice dress, or don't look as good as you in one? Should they suffer because they won't flirt with the professor? Just because he marks me up for playing along doesn't mean he marks anyone else down who doesn't. He did it to me! If he had given you an "a" in front of everyone, would you be complaining? It's like my chemistry teacher once said, "if you've got it, flaunt it." And somewhere underneath that uh... What'd you say he called it? Frumpy tracksuit? You've got it. I don't want to get it like that. Oh, look. Kyle finally made himself useful. I cannot believe neither one of you told me someone tried to break into our room. You're not exactly chatty with us. Uh... Sarah? Maintenance man new keys. Thank you. Thank you. Now that we can sleep soundly. All we have to do is find a guy trolling the halls with a gouge you put in his shoulder. 15.75 seconds. Jenny: That's okay. Jenny (cont.) I'm gonna go home this weekend. You here for dinner tonight? You're working overtime for me, aren't you? What? You never used to work this much. Or go out of town on the weekends. No, kiddo. It's just this deal. It's dragging me by the tail. Worth every second though to see you at Oldbridge. You sure you don't want me to transfer to state? I'd rather have a hundred jobs drag me around first. Okay? Am I cooking, or bringing something home? Home cooked, please! And no starches. Well, I gotta go. Love you, kiddo. Love you. Love you, too. Jenny: Love you, daddy-o. And thanks. You know... I'm sorry about... Ah... Me too. I wish I could... Meddle forever. But, you're an adult now... And you can make your own decisions. But not for being worried. I will always be your mother, whether you let me meddle or not. And a student dying at a party... I just can't turn it off. Kristen: Linda wants to do a makeover for you. How beautiful is she? Stop. You're gonna have to bat the boys away. Or I could just go plain and not have to worry about them bothering me at all. Oh... Jen Jen, having boy troubles already? She's in college, Kris, they're not boys anymore, they're men. All right, are you having men problems? No, I'm not. How about the cute jock? He's a jerk. Oh, do tell. Is he coming on too strong or is he holding back too much? I've only ever found one or the other, casual or confident. Never one who's mastered "casually confident." (Laughs) There's no one, okay? No one I'm dating. No one I'm interested in. Jenny, I... I'm sorry I didn't... Lin, it's not you. Hi. Welcome to blush. Welcome. I'm sorry. You know, we just got these in. Too casual? Too confident? You're the perfect blend of both, you know. What's going on? Promise not to judge me? I'll hold it in. And I'm not moving home. There's a rumor on campus that some of the professors will give a girl better grades if she dresses up for class. And how much truth is there to this rumor? Please don't make a big deal out of it. Jenny, it is a big deal. If it's true, you should report him. Well, no one actually told me to dress up. Then what exactly have they told you?! Nothing. I knew this was going to happen. You've been stuffing down your feelings about that girl dying. Mom, it's... It's not just that. What? Jenny, what? Mom! Mom!! Get in the car. I'm not moving home! You are! Mother! Daughter! Someone broke into your room, and you've been hiding it from me. Lying to me about it! I didn't lie about anything! Sin of omission. Get in the car. No! Others are telling girls to dress up for grades. And a professor died! He had a heart attack. Get in the car! I'm going back to school. You're not. You said yourself I can make my own decisions. Good ones! Jennifer! Jennifer!! Jenny: Thanks, Beth, for picking me up Jenny (cont.) And showing me around town. Hey, do you see this? Someone was trying to get back in. Should we call security? It's after midnight. They won't get here til morning. Maybe it was Sarah trying to get in. Lost her new key? Well, I'm starving. I'm gonna downstairs and eat a snack. Do you want to come with me? I'm really tired. Good night. Good night. [Rattling] [Noise] [Jenny gasps] Kyle, what the heck?! I'm sorry I didn't mean... I just saw you and thought I’d... Scare me half to death? [Both laughing] Um, I-I recommend the protein bars. Okay. [Inaudible] Thanks, Kyle. I'm Ms. Kingsley, your new American history teacher. I can't even believe... This is ridiculous. Beth: Oh, come on. A bunch of rich parents just bribed their kids into college. You don't think any of them wouldn't have jumped at the chance to just get them a new wardrobe? Do you even hear yourself? I mean, do you have any self-respect at all? Yes, enough to shower and put on nice clothes every day. Where's your self respect, Sarah? In here, Beth! In my heart, where I protect it with everything I've got from disgusting, degrading sell-outs like you! Said you wanted to choose? Choose. If I don't keep my grades up, I can't get my scholarship back. She... seriously... Don't. What? Don't make her wrong. She's not wrong. We are. Oh, this is so exciting! [Squeals] Look at you! Wow! Excuse me. Good morning, miss Willis. Good morning, Dr. Davrow. Okay, now you're just kissing up. Wouldn't think of it. Let's talk about psychopathology. For those who can never know what it's like to be inside the mind of a psychopath. Where do we draw the line between abnormality and abnormally genius? Beth: Can I have a salad please? Thank you. I don't have to dress for dinner, do I? Don't act like I’m twisting your arm. Not you. Dr. Davrow. Back up from "C’s". Wonder what I have to do to get the grade I actually deserve in his class? Stop wearing anything at all? [Cell phone rings] Everything all right? I don't know. I'm trying to let her solve her own problems but it isn't easy. You can't hold her hand all through college. She's a smart kid, Kris. You know, her way may not be the same as yours, but she'll find it. I know. Can I steer her from behind a little bit? Jenny: I don't know if this was a good idea. Beth: It's gonna be awesome. Beth: (Cont.) It's totally legit. Beth: (Cont.) Lots of faculty, male and female students, too. Beth: (Cont.) They talk about internships, jobs after graduation, Beth: (Cont.) Make connections for you. I can't believe the girl who is fighting with everything she has to get her track scholarship back is getting crushed so easily by putting on a dress and heels. Okay, fine. Let's go. (Inaudible background chatter and music) I told you it was great. Oh, good evening, ladies. You both look radiant. Beth... The lady in the gold sequin dress is the fashion editor for haute couture. And Jenny... The gentleman in the gray suit books athletic endorsements for running shoes. Track, right? Are you interested in endorsements? Uh, yeah. Great. Let me know if I can make an introduction for either one of you. I'd offer you a drink, but state law, university rules and societal mores prevent it. But do help yourselves to some hors d'oeuvres and mingle. Okay, it's great. Thank you. Quite the soiree, isn't it? Eric told me that he was particularly interested in having you here. Eric? Dr. Davrow. He says that you have great potential as a psychologist. Oh, I'm not actually sure I want to go into psychology. History, maybe? Whatever field you choose, be proud of yourself, Jenny. The world needs all of its young women to grow up proud. Will you excuse me? I'll see you Monday morning, 8 A.M. the war of 1812. Jackson and Lafayette take on New Orleans. Thrilling. You got gray suit's card? Is your face coming to a cereal box near me? Okay, first I have to get back on the track team. Before that, I have to pee. Bathroom? Upstairs. Oh, and don't miss the study on the left. The artwork is unbelievable. Okay. Come with me. Yeah. Sure. Dr. Davrow: Beth. Oh, you'll be okay. Dr. Davrow: Someone I want you to meet. Dr. Davrow: Impressive collection, isn't it? Yeah, um, whose is it? I mean, whose, whose house are we in? Mine. Oh. This is a really nice house. Thank you. Inspired by my travels. Italy. Thailand. Borneo. Estonia. Beautiful city of Tallinn. All the buildings are painted in pastels. I didn't realize teaching at public universities was so lucrative. They don't pay for the teaching. They pay for the name. I spent several years building that, as well. '66 chateau neuf de pape? What happened to state law and social mores? I don't see either in here. Cheers. You don't like me, do you? I... uh... Why do you say that? A man doesn't have to travel the world to discern when a woman doesn't like him. It shows in your eyes every day in class. It's because I suggested you dress up. And you think I'm basing your grades off it. You know, decades ago, in the 60's, it would be unheard of for a woman to show up to class in sweat pants and a torn tee-shirt. So should I get a pink angora sweater and a circle skirt with a poodle on it? You joke, but it was the same for men. 18, 19, 20-year-olds would show up to school every day in a suit and tie. White dress shirts, starched collar and polished black wingtips. Same at the office. Any office. It showed respect for their institutions, their colleagues, themselves. At a university, it showed an appreciation for higher learning, which, I am sorry to say, is lacking in the halls of academia today. You can't deny that. Is it too much for me to ask you to show a little appreciation? Look, I appreciate the wine. And the art. And the party, thank you. But I do wonder, where is the line between normal appreciation and abnormally inappropriate? Clever. I-I was heading to the bathroom. That way. Thanks. You dressed up for your "B," Jenny. This is how you get your "a." [Yells] You thankless ingrate! Jenny! Hey, Jenny! I'm sorry, Jenny. I am so sorry. Dr. Davrow never did anything like that to me, not all last year. The dresses... Yeah. But kissing? [Jenny sobs] I guess he upped his game. Monday morning. Conduct... No! I don’t want to get into a political war with a professor my first month at school. Or ever. I just want to study and run track. Can I please just do that? I'm sorry. 13.2. Not a church picnicker who can do that. (Chuckles) Thanks, coach. What do I have to hit to get on the team? Shave a second off, and I'll fight for you. And the scholarship? Still not my call. Competition for money is... It's even fiercer than the fight for the finish line. No... there's nothing like fighting for the finish line. That's what I love about running. There's no pedigree. Doesn't matter what your name is, what you look like, what you think, do, say. It's just about your legs, your breath, and your time. That's all that matters. Hi. I prefer this look. Me too. You're gonna pay a price for it. But at least you're not broken. Andrew Jackson, hero of New Orleans, ending the English attempt at taking back the colonies they had lost nearly half a century earlier. Dr. Davrow: Okay, I need a volunteer. Miss Willis. No, thank you. Excuse me? You asked for volunteers. I'm not. Participation is not optional in my class. When I call on you, you come. Privilege of authority. You won't break me. I what? Break you. I hope everyone is paying attention. I need a volunteer. Alexis. Come on up. I know what you're doing. You don't know anything, Jenny. If you did, you wouldn't be doing this to yourself. I'm not doing anything to myself. You're the one doing this to me. You're just an arrogant, entitled misogynist, and if you don't start grading according to my merit, I'm gonna report you T... To whom? You clearly haven't thought this out. It doesn't matter who you go to. My department chair. The faculty conduct committee. With any of them, it's the word of a prestigious professor against a freshman girl who offered him sex in exchange for better grades. I have tenure, Jenny. Do you know what that is? They can't fire me. They can't censure me. They can't dock my pay. But for you, win or lose, how do you think that will go for your track scholarship? Or we can just put all of this ridiculousness behind us and give each other what we want. Jenny: You said he didn't Mark down girls who don't play along. I didn't think he did. But I it's not like we all talk to each other about it. I didn't know anybody who didn't play along. Until you. He's right about reporting him though. Even if they believe you, there's nothing they can do to him, and you'll suffer anyway. Will you come with me to report him? Beth, please. I'm guilty, Jenny. He forced you. Not like that. He suggested, and I complied. I'm sorry. They wouldn't believe two students more than one, anyway. Universities don't want to hear about this kind of stuff. Not from us. But maybe from faculty? Close the door, Ms. Willis. Close the door! She was so excited to come to school. She's been sullen since day one. That poor girl in her room. She said a professor died, and there was a break in. Jenny's not having trouble with any faculty, is she? Oh, no, no, no just the dorms. Adjusting to her new roommates. Unless you've noticed something in class? No. I mean, I can only speak for myself, of course, but I've found Jenny to be a treasure. Bright, confident. Qualities she apparently inherited. Uh, would you uh... I feel terrible even asking this, snowplow mom times a thousand, but uh... Would it be okay with you if I checked in every now and then, just to see how she's doing? Of course. Anytime. Thank you... Eric. Here's your orange passion. Mom. What are you... What are you doing here? These are delicious. You gotta start making them for me at home. (Chuckles) They're like 700 calories. Well, worth it for the ice breaker. I'm sorry that I push you so hard. Sorry for pushing back harder. - Your dad was... - Dad was... I uh, met one of your teachers. Mom, I'm not in fifth grade anymore. Right. Professors. Yeah. He's very charming. You talked to Dr. Davrow?! He thinks you're wonderful. Mom... I swear! Stay out of it, please! I am just trying to help! [Door opens] Sorry. I'll get out of your way. You're not in my way. I'm always in your way, Sarah. What? Since the day I got here you’ve made it very clear you want me as far away as possible. Sorry you got stuck with two fake roommates. I shouldn't have said that. Look, I know. I know I've been mean. But if you want to talk... What's with the change of heart? Do you want to go to the park? Hey. You two going somewhere? Jenny: The park. You want to come? Sarah: You know what? Actually, I feel like maybe I should stay back and study. Jenny: No, no, no, no. You took the step. You're coming. Beth: He's cute. Why don't you go ride with him? If I wasn't as blond as I look, I'd say you were trying to get rid of me. That didn't even make sense. Sarah, please. If you've had a change of heart toward me, maybe you can have one toward Beth, too? And you, the same. Please, I really need both of you right now. [Loud noise] Beth code blue. What's going on? Jenny oh, my god. What was that? Ride announcer (on speaker) We're experiencing some type of technical difficulty. Jenny seriously? Sarah: Are we gonna die? Ride announcer (on speaker) We apologize for the inconvenience. I heard you guys. About not wanting to get into a political battle with the professor. Dr. Davrow. You too? Yeah. You fought him off? Good for you. 'Cause I didn't. And it was more than just kissing. Oh my gosh, Sarah... You slept with him? And you've been judging me all this time? Beth! No! How dare you, Sarah! How dare you point the finger at me like I'm some... You don't understand! It was awful! It was horrible! I felt so... So dirty. And so I stopped and then when I did, he didn’t just drop me back down to the grades I was getting before, he-he failed me. Like... like F’s. And he had other professors do it, too. He had other professors do it to me. And Elaine. Wait, what? She was brave... Like you. She was going to report him. And then she just falls from the dormitory roof. Oh my gosh! You think Dr. Davrow killed her? And I just... And I just shut up. Jenny, I am so sorry. I should have said something to you sooner. I just... I have been so... Scared. Dr. Davrow couldn't have killed Elaine. A faculty member couldn't make it all the way to the rooftop of a dorm without getting recognized. And during a party! Okay, then someone's helping him. Or there's... Or nothing. Dr. Davrow shouldn't be forcing girls to dress up or anything else for grades, I'll give you that. But that doesn't mean he has anything to do with Elaine. There's no way. Hey, look, it doesn't matter. Whether he killed Elaine or not, what he's doing alone is enough that we have to report him. Now you want to go to war? I don't care about my scholarship anymore. I don't care if they kick me out of school for making a scene. I mean, he can't keep doing this. And if he did kill Elaine, all the more reason. He killed Elaine. Or somebody did it for him. But I... I can't say anything, Jenny. I'm finally getting good grades again. I... It's too dangerous. He'll kill me. He'll kill you, too. So he just gets away with it? With all of it? Maybe he'll forgot about you. That's the best you can hope for. And Elaine? Do we all just... Forget about her? [Ride engine starts] A wide range of disorders can experience psychotic symptoms from full blown schizophrenia to more mild afflictions like schizoaffective and borderline personality disorders... Are you kidding me?! Sit down, Ms. Willis. Me... sit down? How about you stand up? And you! Okay, what's more important, an "a" in misogynistic psychology or integrity for the rest of your lives? That's enough! Yeah, it is. One more word from you, and I will drop you from this class with an incomplete. Word. That is the perfect example of borderline personality disorder. [Door slams] I'm reporting him. Are you guys coming with me? (Scoffs) Whatever. Wait. [Door closes] Are you scared? Yeah. But I also feel kind of free. Tell me about Elaine. Elaine was awesome. She was smart. Like really smart. I was struggling in calculus, and she made it seem so easy. And she was really nice. But like... an intuitive kind of nice. Like she would know exactly what you needed. [Screaming] Sarah! Sarah! Help! Someone help! I got you. I got you. Sarah! Hi. How's she doing? She's... breathing, but... But not waking up. Thank you, Dane. You saved my life. Yeah. Of course. [Cell phone rings] [Cell phone rings] Honey? Are you okay? - no, mom. I messed everything up. I dressed up for Dr. Davrow, and then he attacked me... And I think he killed Elaine and he might have just killed Sarah also. Kristen (on phone) Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming okay? Hurry up, just take it. Kristen: Linda! Manage the store for me tonight? Of course. Come on. Let's go. Wait! Are you okay? Yeah. Oh! I'm fine. I gotta go. Did you see him? The guy that threw us over the rail? Was it Dr. Davrow? Dr. Davrow? No, I-I didn't see anybody. I just ran to you. Oh my gosh, Beth! Hey. Beth, are you okay? Beth (on phone) I'm fine. Stupid Dane came back and tore through our room again. No, what? I told you I wasn't convinced. He picked the lock. Completely destroyed the place. No, Beth, Dane's with me. He's been with me all day. Someone tried to kill me and Sarah. What? Are you okay? Sarah's in a coma. Alive, but the police are here. Jenny, listen, whoever attacked you, whoever was here, they're not done. Whoever, Beth. We know who it was. Did you see him? I... well, no, but... Then it doesn't matter. Whether it was him or somebody else. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Sarah was right. It's too dangerous. I'm scared. Jenny: The police are here. So, you brought the victim in from the clock tower? She was attacked, too. Can you identify the attacker? No. Can you think of anyone that would want to harm you? Please. No. I detest local news. So, I was thinking... Maybe we could go out tonight? Dinner, a movie? Is it really so bad if anybody sees us out together? There's enough gossip on campus among the students. We don't need to add to that. Right. Okay. I agree. I'm just going to... [Sighs] Oh my god. What? Do you jog? No, I... I didn't know that you did. I knew you were seeing other people, but students? The girls on the bridge, Eric? What did you do? What have you done? Didn't I say I don't like to be the subject of gossip? What? [Ms. Kingsley screams] So, you think Dr. Davrow? I think, but I-I can't prove. Do you think it was the right move not telling the police? Hey, are you okay? Yeah, just tweaked it after everything today. Thank you, Dane. You're welcome. I mean, if you hadn't been there, I'd be in the ICU next to Sarah. Or worse. Um... This is... I don't want this to sound the wrong way. If your room isn't safe... I mean uh, if you need somewhere to stay tonight... I'm gonna go home. I mean, I'm gonna move home, I think. Leave school? No. Just drive in. Yeah, maybe dorm life's not for me after all. My mom's coming to pick me up. [Elevator bell rings] Hey. Oh my god. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm just exhausted. I'm gonna shower then my mom's coming to get me. What? You should come with me. At least for a few nights. It's not safe here. Yeah. Okay. Uh, you take a shower, and relax, and I'll pack some stuff. - Okay. - Okay. Is that all they took? Yeah. That's all. I just need you to sign this, please. Okay. Can I go now? Mm-hmm. Thanks. Hey, you got the store? Hey. How are you doing? I'm fine. You should dress that leg. It's fine. I gotta go. [Water running] [Phone rings] Jenny, I'm so sorry. I'm just leaving the store right now. I'm racing to you. Okay, I'll be there soon as I can. Okay, bye. Call me when you get this. Jenny! [Gasps] Ugh! We have got to stop doing that. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I-I'll fix it. Uh, it's-it's fine. Beth said there was someone in your room again? I don't know. I wasn't home. I'm just... I'm just tired.. Of course. Yeah. Jenny! Jenny, wait! Jenny! Jenny, wait! Beth! Beth! Let me go! Listen to me! What is going on? He broke into the room! I saw his shoulder! Wait. - Did you kill Elaine?! - No! Why'd you break in? Do you have a key? Elaine gave me the key. Why would she give you a key? I loved her. We were dating, all last year. All summer. Elaine never dated. It's not allowed for R.A.'S and undergrads so we didn't tell anyone. I loved her. I want to find out who killed her. Bull! Find out how? What are you looking for in here? Elaine sent me a text the night she died. She was sending it right when she was killed. Elaine... fell. In the middle of texting me? What proof? Pictures. I'm not sure of what. She took them on her phone at one of those "dinners" and printed them to make sure they couldn't disappear. Good thing, too, because her phone got smashed when she died. But I don't know where she put them. Her parents let me go through everything they took from here but... I-I think they're still in here if you haven't found them yet... I didn't do this. I cut your shoulder. That time, yes. But you almost caught me, and then the new lock... Which you tried to pick. I couldn't get in! I didn't do this. I’ll prove it to you if we can find the pictures. Just help me, please! For Elaine. Okay, where haven't you looked? Almost everywhere. I'd barely started. Okay, we'll help you. Let's start looking. (Whispering) He's lying, Jen. You even said, a "guy she dumped." He had a key. He could have gotten in here during the party. He could have killed Elaine, and no one would ever... Okay, it doesn't hurt to look, Beth. Okay, search Sarah's bed. Hey. I found something. Beth? You? But, if he forced you... He didn't force me. I love Dr. Davrow. He's brilliant and beautiful. A genius. But you you told me to dress up for him. You told me about the study with the art... You delivered me to him. I was trying to help you! Get your grades up. Get you your track scholarship! But he was right, you're so... Ungrateful. And so was Elaine. She was going to expose the whole thing. And not only ruin Dr. Davrow's good name, she was going to ruin mine! I would have been kicked out of school, no college degree, no future at all. And so you murdered her? I wanted to keep her quiet. I wanted the pictures, but she fought me, and she fell. She fell! Sarah didn't fall! Sarah stayed quiet. The whole thing had quieted down until you came around and stirred it back up again. And you... Breaking in here. I suppose I should thank you. I've been looking for those. Phone too. Time to delete that text. Why didn't she just text you the pictures? I'd ask her, if you hadn't killed her! [Gunshot] Kyle: Come on! Wait, wait. I'm not going to make it down 12 flights. - Yes, you are. - I'm not fast enough. Come on. Beth: Hey! Come on. [Growling] You can't run! You can't hide! Call Jenny! Mom? I'm on my way. I'll be there as soon as I can. Are you okay? Where are you? I'm coming to the dorms. No, no, no! Not there! Jenny, I can't hear you. Mom? Call Jenny! Call Jenny! Where's the police station? This way. This way. Okay. [Tires screech and squeal] Kyle: Jenny! Yeah. It's crazy how this all went down, huh? Kyle finds out that the love of his life is sleeping with Dr. Davrow.. To get her grades up, and in a jealous rage, throws her off the rooftop. What are you talking about? Beth: I'm talking about how Jenny saw the scratch she gave to the guy who broke into our room on your arm, and you killed her. It's just lucky that I got here in time to shoot you with your own gun before you got away with murder. No. Again. Beth, please, you don't have to do this, Beth. [Gunshot] Are you crazy? No, Jenny. I'm pissed. Pissed that you just wouldn't let it go! You know, I liked you. You were a way better roommate than Sarah... But at least she shut up! Now look what you made Kyle do. [Tires screech] You are... Crazy! Kristen: Jenny! Are you okay? I'm okay. You're okay. Kyle! Kyle. Kyle. Okay. Hey. It's okay. Yes. We need help. A student's been shot outside the dorms. At um.. Channing and... and Telegraph! Hey. Hang on. Hang on for life. Man's voice: Is everyone okay? No, we need help. We need a doctor. Man's voice: I'm a doctor. Psychology. Does that help? How'd he know where we...? Beth told you that Sarah and I were on the bridge. He killed professor Harrington. That old man thought he was better than me. Wanted to report me! If he was thirty years younger, he would have been thanking me. You really did raise a fine... Fine daughter, Mrs. Willis. [Gunshot] Aah! I know. [Police siren] Hey. You know what "R.A." Stands for? "Really awesome." Good enough to get my scholarship back? It is still not my decision. It's the athletic director's. [Squealing] [Jennie squealing] Don't do that! [Group laughing] Sarah, can I just say how happy I am that you're Jenny's roommate. Mom... What? Let me gush. Hey, guys. This is Lisa, your new...- jenny/Sarah roommate! Jenny: Welcome. [Glasses clink] [Laughter]
