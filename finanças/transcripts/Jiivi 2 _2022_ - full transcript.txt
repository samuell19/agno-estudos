Porur...Porur Sir are you going to porur. My hometown is Madurai. I love reading books. I'm also interested in exploring things. But I'm working here in Chennai for sake of my family. He is my friend Mani. I was in love with Anandhi who worked in the opposite shop. But she jilted me because I didn't earn more money. Being depressed, after boozing heavily, I decided to go back to my hometown. That's when I got a almirah key. And Mani told me that the key belongs to our landlady. We immediately planned to steal... And after stealing, we betrayed Ibrahim who stays in the next room. At that moment, my father died when he was aware that my sister has eloped. At that time, my sister came to see my father... I took my sister to see my deceased father. Again I came back to Chennai. Since the landlady fell in love and eloped, her father died. When she came to his death, her brother took her to see him. And she told me about this. My sister called me on phone and said that she consulted an astrologer, ...she will have a baby girl and my brother-in-law will fall ill. That's when I remembered this "law of correlation" that I read somewhere. Feared whether this fate will affect my family, And thinking that I can find this out, I told Mani to call the landlady's brother Kathir... ...to booze with us and by inquiring him, I thought I might get some information and boozed with Kathir. Kathir had a friend like Mani and his name was Kumar. He died in an accident when crossing the railway line. After I knew that Kumar's hometown is Naduvakottai, I went to Kumar's house to find this law of correlation... There I inquired at a timber depot and at the Zamin. Where I saw my family photo in the Zamin, And when I asked my mother about it, Kathir and Kumar were arrested by cops from that Zamin in jewelry theft case, And both of them betrayed Murugan, an innocent who worked in Zamin. And when the cops took Murugan, his blind mother cried and cursed. Knowing everything, when I came to Mani and said, He didn't trust me and took the jewelry slip from the locker and ran away. When I thought I could find him, I heard the screaming of the landlady and went upstairs, Kavitha has attempted suicide. If this law of correlation has to be concluded, I thought I should marry our landlady's daughter. I told her that I will marry Kavitha And came home thinking somehow this law of correlation was concluded. Hey, you... Where did you go? You fool... Where did you go? Hey, Mani... First tell me where did you go? Kavitha cut off her hand. Okay. I took her to the hospital. Okay. If all these are to be solved, I thought it was right that I should marry that girl. That's why I told the landlady that I will marry Kavitha. You mean, your "focal point", right? Hey, come and sit in front. Not you, sir. You sit. Hey, you come and sit in front. Tell me. Will you come home for lunch? Yes...yes... I'm coming home for lunch. My friend is coming with me. Cook for him too. Okay, I'll hang up the call. Okay, dear. I asked you to sit in front to talk with me. Do you have a job or not? You are lucky, your in-laws have bought you a vehicle. You stay with me. You can drive this vehicle in partial time.

Give me the bag, keep it. Sir, please sit. Sit close. Let the child on your lap. Dude, come back. It had been ten months since I met Saravanan. Afraid that I might blabber to him that I lost the bag... I'm wandering everywhere looking for the one who stole the bag. Somehow I should find the bag and give to him, That's why I have not seen Saravanan so long. But I don't know how long will I be out of his sight. If he see me someday... For two people, brother. Okay. Was your "focal point" rectified? Don't know, Mani. But so far no problem. It has been a long time since I saw our room. Hey, I'm not there now. Are you staying in landlady's house? Do you remember Satish? Who? The reporter? He vacated the house. After my marriage, we all moved over there. Oh! -Move a little. -Okay, mam. What? Come. Come. Mani has come, Kavitha. Welcome, brother. Come in. Are you doing good, Kavitha? I'm good, brother. Your friend is taking good care of me. How are you doing, brother? -I'm good, dear. Where is mom?

Hey, you are intelligent! Okay, eat. Come. How many days it has been since I visited last? I'm thinking of buying an own car. Car? Why now? I have earned and saved upto one lakh rupees. One lakh rupees? No need to pay rent and I eat at her house, So, I don't have any major expenses. That's why, I am thinking to buy a second hand car and drive in "Get ride". You mean like Ola and Uber? You have become a family man. Kavitha! Mani is leaving. Bye, dear. Bye, brother. Okay. -Okay, let's see. Come front. Don't move. Her health is weak.

Hey, kill him. Hey! I lost one and half crore rupees in business. I took a loan of eighty lakhs mortgaging the house. I lost everything, sister. I was told to vacate the house. I denied. Immediately they sent people to kill me. My good time, if Saravanan is not there, I'd have been killed. Repay it. All these are your earnings. No, sister. Sit. Saravanan, the vehicle has arrived. Careful... Slowly, brother. Slowly... Come, Saravanan. Doctor! I saw Kavitha's reports. Her health is good now. So, shall we fix the date by next week for surgery? No, doctor. I need a month. Why?

Check, go... -Sir! Follow that and send me the bill soon. Will note and do, sir. -Sir! Hey, what? I need fifty thousand rupees. You joined this job only last month, right? He joined this job only last month, right? He is asking money as if he had given me. Take him out, first. Come, Saravanan. Making me tensed in the morning... He is in tension, Saravanan. You are speaking to him at this time. You'd have told me, isn't it? Hi Mani, it's been a long time since I saw you. How is your job going on? Okay, brother. Going on better. Okay. Who? For him? Yes, brother. Do you have any land document? I don't have anything like that. Mani, I can help something if there is document else it's very difficult. No problem, let's see. Hi, Saravanan! OTP -7745 Okay, sir. Sir! Just a minute. Hello! Yes, I saw that guy once with my friend. Suddenly he is asking money. I saw him with my friend and spoke well. For that sake, how can I help him when I doesn't know his whereabouts. Dear, the medicine is over. Tell him to get when he comes home. Okay. Ask him to buy groceries also. Call Saravanan. Hello! Dad's medicines are over. Get it when coming home. Buy groceries also. -I will send you a voice message, buy all those things. Okay, dear. Take it. Sit, let's go. Have you paid? Dear, the house owner came and shouted since the rent has not been paid. Somehow arrange and send him. Tell me, mom. Nothing dear, I have to go to a wedding close to the house. Will you send me some money? How much? Two thousand rupees is enough. Okay. The engine oil is less. Didn't you check whether there is water in the radiator? If you've driven for few more days, the head would've been damaged. I have to dismantle the head and check. It will cost thirty five thousand rupees. Why so much money? Are you new? Don't you know how much it costs to repair a diesel vehicle? Look Saravanan, get the vehicle ready and come. I will ask the manager to enroll you. Okay? When the husband was inebriated, The miscreants killed his wife, stole the jewelry and money. Knowing this, the husband committed suicide. After thorough investigation, We will reveal the full information, said Inspector Duraiswamy. Who is bad among these two? Is the thief or the inebriated ? What life is this, Mani? We lived with what we had until marriage. No matter how much we earn, it's not enough now. What will I do? When I go home after work, Kavitha asks to buy groceries, milk, medicines for her father, ...treatment for mother and something to buy for nephew, And now eight lakhs for Kavitha's eye surgery, Thirty five thousand rupees for car, House rent, electricity bill and moreover I lost my job too. Why is this happening only to me? Leave it, dude. Everything will be alright. That's how life is. But why only our life become like this? Mother, Father, Teacher, God and Money. If we don't have money, we become a burden even to our parents, Mani. It's true. Teacher will humiliate us in front of everyone if we don't pay the fee while studying. If we go to temple to visit God, And if we offer five rupees to the priest, He gives sacred ash even without touching our hand. But if you offer five hundred rupees, he will adore you with garland. If the money from lower caste person goes to an upper caste, does he throw it away? He won't, isn't it? Because it's money. Money is everything. Money has no caste and creed. Even the one rupee coin kept on the forehead of the dead... ...fulfills the hunger of someone, Mani. Will there be money in Hari, the fool's house? Why is he a fool? He is a good guy. This society calls good people as fools. Hey, are you going to ask him money? I'm going to steal in Hari's house. What? Hey, what are you talking? Did you think of Kavitha's life if anything happens to you? Don't talk like this. Ever it's the same reason, Mani. Only for the sake of family. You don't fear. I'll do this when Hari is with us. Call Hari tomorrow to your room to booze. Ask him to call me after he comes. I will tell that I'm on duty and will come after half an hour. But when I'm talking to him, I'll be downstairs of his house. You both start boozing, only then time will go on. I'll take and come to your room. Let three of us booze together. Only his grandma is there in his house. He too won't go to the police station to file a complaint. Let's see. Though if he files a complaint, we might be arrested on suspicion only. Hari himself will tell that we were with him. There won't be any problem. Hey! Tell me. Nothing... It's okay, tell me. Don't know how you feel but I'm scared when thinking of fate written by god. We are the crowd who bribe the god, feared of him. How can we be good in other places? You take care of Hari not to leave. I'll come, talk and leave him in his house the next day. Your planning is well. Either the jewelry or money you steal, Will you give half of the share immediately this time? Okay come, let's go. The lord created it, sent it to me and asked me to enjoy. What's this, brother? Excellent! ' Lot of stuff here! Wow! Chips! Great enjoyment today! Excellent, brother! Excellent, brother! You are my darling, brother! Brother, where is Saravanan brother? I'm in work, isn't it? Better you call him. The outgoing is free, isn't it? Simply saying you have work. Tell me. Brother, I have arrived, didn't you come? I will finish the duty, get my money and leave. What's the time now? 7.45 p.m I will come by 8.30. He will be coming at 8.30. What Saravanan? Grandma, I came to see whether Hari is here. Hari went out. Did you call him or shall I call him? I will talk to him, grandma. Okay. Hari, Saravanan came here. He asked you, I said you went out. Call him and speak. Hey, it's inauspicious if the lizard falls on. Move away. Yeah, where is Hari? He left. Oh, no! You took it, right? Then why are you looking dull? When I was leaving, Hari's grandma saw me. I managed her but she sent a voice message to Hari. What happened then? Did you kill grandma? Hey, what are you going to do now? Don't know. Hey, it's 9 o'clock. Didn't get any information yet. You call Hari. Are you trying to link me? I can't tolerate if thrashed. Hey, call him. It's switched off. He wouldn't have woke up since boozed high. Who is that? Hello! I'm the constable speaking from U2 police station. Cop? Tell me, sir. Who is speaking? My name is Saravanan. Then, Mani? Mani is here. Both of you come to Hari's house. What happened, sir? Nothing, why are you getting panic? Okay, sir. Calling us? Oh, no! Hey, do the cops knew? I'm scared. Don't be scared, Mani. Either grandma would've told or they have noted the voice message. Let's see. Hey! Who are you? Hari's friend. Your name? Saravanan. You? Mani, sir. Go stand there. The Inspector will arrive, let's talk. Hey, what's this? Hey, what? Stand away. Irritating without listening me. Hello! Tell me. I don't want all those. You take care. Sir! -Is it? Wait, he will come. -When to go? I can't. Just wait. Tell me, dear. -Who is he? -Speaking on phone continuously. Okay, I'll see. But not possible now. Very difficult. Okay, did you eat or not? When are you leaving? Okay, I'll call you later.

Sir, people have come for enquiry regarding Hari's murder. Tell them to come. Sir, all have come. Come. Shall I tell the names, sir? He is Muthu, Hari's driver. Ask him to stand there. Go stand there. Sir, he is groceries store keeper. Greetings, sir! Ask him to leave. You leave. Okay, sir. They are Mani and Saravanan. Hari's friends. They three will always be together. Ask them to stand there. Go stand there. Sir, he is Hari's servant. He is staying there. Ask him to stand. -Go stand there. Sir, they are local chain snatchers. Go out. . You leave. Sir, he is the delivery boy. Go. Go. Sir! Where were you when the murder happened? Hari's grandma wanted to go to temple in the evening. I dropped her back in the house. Later, I didn't go anywhere. But I have worked for long time in their house, sir. Okay, leave. -Okay, sir. Get full details and send him. Tell me, what were you doing on that day? Sir, we all together... Wait, you tell me. No, sir. We all three were boozing in the room. Okay, why did you go to Hari's house? Hari called me. He said that he came and asked when will I come? We always booze in Hari's house. So, I went there. But, Hari's grandma told me that he went to Mani's house. Then, I left from there, sir. Sir, Hari's grandma has come. She wants to meet you, sir. Hari's corpse will be brought home after autopsy. Why did you come here? Sir, I know who killed my grandson. They must be four to five people. I have recorded their voices. You listen to it and find them soon, sir. Give me. Grandma! Why are you here? Saravanan! Last night, I saw four to five people came and hit Hari. I have recorded their voices. I came to give that here. Grandma, what's the next step about Hari? I informed the relatives in Srirangam. I will take Hari there. Take it. Hey, what are you thinking? They sent us after grandma came and told them. Who will they be? Don't think about that and get confused. Take some money from that and get your car repaired. No, Mani. We shouldn't do anything now. Let's see. Hey, that Inspector spoke well, isn't it? I think he is good. To say in your words, he is a fool. He is not good, Mani. We can trust even an enraged one. But we shouldn't trust the one who speaks to make us believe him. Ever since Hari's death, my heart has been palpitating. I'm leaving. Definitely. Come soon. Okay, I'll leave. Saravanan. Please sit. I need to talk. Did you see the people who came here? Yes. They all are our relatives. Fourteen years ago, three people from the hometown joined together, ...spent two and half lakhs each and bought a vacant place. They have been asking for long time to sell it. It was aunt's property. I'll get twelve and half lakhs for my share. I want to sell it for the current issues. We have to go to hometown tomorrow. Tell your friend and arrange a car. Ask Mani also to come. Okay, uncle. Hey, how is it possible? I don't know. Dad! Hey, what happened? Don't know. He spoke well last night. Suddenly, he didn't wake up in the morning. The doctor came and told that he had died in his sleep. Oh, no! Why is this happening? Why should he die suddenly when he was well? Dude, don't be angry by what I say. Did you call your uncle? That's what I'm also thinking. If this is the fate, nothing will happen to me next, right? Hey! I'm scared. Dad! Dad! Okay, I will call later. Saravanan, what happened? Don't know, mom. He died in his sleep. He was well, isn't it? That's what I don't understand. Go inside, sister. -Okay. Brother! Sister! Sister, he was well, isn't it? Where is brother-in-law? He is on the way. Okay, sit. Careful..careful... Sit aside. Keep a pillow. This side... Move this side... Careful... Down...down... Hey, come here. Hey, slowly...slowly... What happened? Kavitha sister's father died. Okay, go. Careful...careful... Turn this side. Come and see the face. Careful...careful... Keep it. Those who want to see the face, come. Go without looking back. Those who didn't see can come. Others go back. Take everything. It's inauspicious if the lizard falls on. Ever since Hari's death, my heart has been pounding. Why is this happening? Why should he die suddenly when he was well? If this is fate, nothing will happen to me next, right? Saravanan, come here. What's the problem, tell me. Just wait, let's see the doctor. You go inside. What's that you keep thinking? Relax. What happened? How did you come to know this is happening continuously? Doctor, a year ago, my sister eloped with her boyfriend. My father died when he knew it. When I came to Chennai, My landlady said that twenty two years ago, She eloped and her father died when he knew it. She told that her brother is taking care of her like I take care of my sister. It's happening continuously in both the families. That's why I married the landlady's daughter. I thought this law (destiny) will end if I marry like that. But a couple of days before, my father-in-law died. I'm feared whether this law is happening again in my life, doctor. Quite interesting. In my life, I have seen many cases like this. What everyone who comes here will say... Doctor, I think of something and it happens. I had a dream that someone dies, And someone I know passed away. And they say, suddenly I remember my past birth. I was a King in last birth. Everyone will say them as King and not as beggar. I have heard many similar cases but what you say is bit different. That is, what happens to you is happening to someone else also, right? Yes, doctor. See, Mr. Saravanan. If you have any problem related to mentally and physically, we can give treatment for it. But what you say is unscientific. You say destiny and karma continues. It's not right to seek a solution from the psychiatrist. To be frank, if you ask whether there is a solution for this, I don't have the answer. So, the destiny and correlation which your mind believes, you find something from it. Did you refer any books? No, doctor. I have studied lot of books. I think it's destiny, doctor. Then, find out what it is. You believed that your destiny will change if you marry that girl, right? Yes. When your problems are continuing again, Then from it, better find out what's your problem. Mr, Saravanan, there is a solution for everything in life. Since you are here now, can I believe that everything you tell me is true? So, only your mind knows. Find out with help of it, simple. Okay, doctor. Thank you. Attender of baby Kani. Okay, give me. Here it is. Hello! Hello, Saravanan! Tell me without weeping, sister. The baby has lost her vision. We are in the hospital. My husband came to the hospital. When he knew about this, he got fits. I'm very much scared, Saravanan. Please come soon. I'm coming immediately, sister. Saravanan! Sit quietly. How do you know that this is happening continuously? Saravanan, while going to sewing class your sister had eloped with someone... Trusting him, I eloped from my house. Your father got heart attack, hearing that. -What happened, sister? My father died of heart attack after hearing that. The astrologer told me I will have a baby girl. But told to care of my husband's health. The baby has lost her vision. My husband got fits when he knew about this. The correlation law, Mani. Similiar things will occupy the generations of different families. Ever since I thought of stealing the jewelry, Everything that is happening in my family related to me, And everything that happens in our landlady's house are the same. Thought and action all happen like the same. There is a solution for everything in life. Since you are here now, can I believe that everything you tell me is true? So, only your mind knows. Find out with help of it, simple. Who is baby Kani's attender? Sister. Come, sister. Doctor, baby Kani's attender. Come. Nothing to worry. Okay. The baby is partially blind. She was very much scared. If we do a minor laser surgery, everything will be fine. How much it will cost, doctor? Ask in the reception. They will give the full details. Okay, sir. It will cost seventy-five thousand, sir. Pay twenty-five thousand by today evening, sir. The doctor has fixed the surgery tomorrow morning at 6.30. Where are you, Mani? Brother! Come, why are you here suddenly? You didn't even call. Sit. What's the matter? My sister's baby has become partially blind. Oh, no! To our baby Kani? Yes, brother. What happened? The doctor said the surgery should be done immediately. If you lend me one lakh rupees... No one will give me if I ask at this situation. I wished everyone should be good. I want my sister's family to be well, that's why I didn't get married. Now I'm not in a stance to help you, Saravanan. Forgive me. Leave it, brother. Get me a job abroad. I will take care of all. They are not recruiting anyone now, Saravanan. I must vacate this house in a week. If there is any recruitment abroad, definitely I will tell you. Okay, brother. Okay. He is living in such a big house. Is it believable when he says he has no money? What are you thinking, Mani? I will take care, go. Bye, brother. Is there any family problem? Nothing like that, sir. Have any of Hari's friends created ruckus? I know only Saravanan and Mani as his friends. I don't know anyone else. Let's go. Sir, I will go and bring him. Sir, the Inspector is waiting, come. I'm coming. Greetings, sir! Tell him, sir. Hari was not regular to college, sir. Though we send memo to home, there won't be any response, sir. You can go, sir. Any of Hari's friends? No, sir. Not familiar with him. He will not talk properly to anyone. Dude, what happened? But we will see him in Mani brother's tea shop. He will always be there. Hari will be with you often, right? No, sir. I'll see him often in Mani brother's tea shop. Don't lie. Sir, I'm telling you only the truth. Okay, go. Sorry, sir. I couldn't track. Gandhi, this case will not end it seems.. Come. Haven't you fixed this light yet? Called a guy, brother. Switch it off. This too is shattering. He is going to shout if he see. What? Sir, the Inspector asked the file. Is this one? Yes, sir. Not now. The Inspector is in tension. Let us give it later. Okay, sir. Then I will keep the file on his table. Greetings, sir! Hey! Sir, Saravanan and Mani. Have they come? Are they? Hey, who is he? Chain snatching, sir. The Inspector ripped him off. It will take a month for him to get up and walk. Drag him aside. Hey, come. Dude, look here. We have enquired everywhere. Everyone says both of your names only. He is already furious. If you say the truth, We will surrender you both to court without any hassle and finish this case. What are you saying, sir? Hari is our friend. We all three will hang out together. By enquiring, you make it look like we are guilty. If you had asked us, we would've said it ourselves. We cannot accept since you want to close this case. Sir! Sir! Sir, Hari's grandma has come. Lawyer Madhusudhanan has come with her, sir. Hey, the voice message is working. Get up. I gave you all the evidences, right? Then, why are you investigating that guys? Shut up. Sir, she is my client. Don't disturb the guys anymore. I think you will understand. Good, because of the voice message sent by grandma, we got escaped. Grandma came suddenly and saved us like a god. Else, it'd have been a big problem. Tell me, brother. Sit. Bring two cups of tea. What do you know about Hari? Do someone else know about him? Does he have a girlfriend? Did you ask me to come to talk about this? Hey, sit. Do you know we are trapped in a big problem? Brother, I swear I don't know anything about him. If he comes to college, he will sit next to me. That's all. If you all enquire me just for this, what can I do? He was not even regular to college, brother. To my knowledge, he doesn't have friends in college. I don't know about girlfriends, brother. Okay, brother. It's getting late, I'll leave. Hey, why are you asking him all this? No, I'm afraid that something wrong might happen. Why? I'm leaving. When did you come, mom? Kavitha, where is your mom? She went to hospital to see the baby. Okay, bring me water. Take it. Dear. Give me your hand. I'm pregnant. Hey, what are you saying? Yes. I will go out and come. Okay, dear. Hey, come. What happened? Why are you looking dull? Kavitha is pregnant, Mani. It's a happy message. Why are you looking dull for that? No, Mani. I read in the library. This is a "traingular law". If something goes wrong, And if it comes to us unexpectedly... Ever since Hari's death, my heart has been palpitating. This law will continue in our family. Kavitha, my nephew, now my child, This law of correlation seems to be worst, Mani. This has not reached the focal point yet. I'm scared when thinking what will happen next. Why does all the problems come only to women? Because they are women, Mani. Like how you both are close friends, I too have a friend Siva. He is in Trichy. He works in Honda bike showroom. Hari said his friend Siva is working in Trichy, isn't it? I'm going to meet him tomorrow. What will happen by meeting him now? I don't understand anything. It's confusing. If we want to understand all this, We must know what happened earlier.

Saravanan, the baby has regained vision now. They told there isn't any problem. Okay, sister. I will come and see in person. Siva? Tell me. I have come to enquire about Hari. Hey, wait...wait... What's this? -Yes. Why are you running in fear looking at me? I didn't kill Hari, brother. Then why did you run with fear looking at me? Yeah, who are you? Why are you asking all these? He is a friend to me too. He is like my brother. He had told everything about you. What's the problem between you? First, I planned to steal. Then, that sister came. Not knowing what to do, I killed in fear. What did you steal? Who did you kill? What did Hari say you? You both are friends. You work in Honda show rooom. And you both will meet once in a week. Oh, no! Did I blabber? Hey! I will fresh up and come. Let's talk. Yeah, who are you? I have seen you somewhere. You'd have saw me in Hari's death. Which is your hometown? My hometown is Naduvakottai. Hey, Saravanan! When did you come? Did you meet Siva? I met Siva. Do you know who he is? Who? My hometown is Naduvakottai. A year ago, my father died in an accident. Then, the cops and press often visit my house for enquiry. So we vacated the house and came here. What's your father's name? Kumar. He died when crossing a railway line. Do you know Naduvakottai? That's the hometown of Kumar. But he is not there now. Why? What happened? He died when crossing a railway line. Who do you want? Kumar... Wait a minute, I'll call mom. Siva is Kumar's son, a friend of Kathir. Are you getting shocked just for this, Mani? Then, someone moved on the street next to our house. We often see him at the wine shop. In few days, we became familiar. We were drunk and hanging around often. One day, he took them to his house. While boozing, he told them he has more money and jewels. Siva who was inebriated thought of stealing it somehow. Siva had stolen the jewels after he was sloshed. At that time, his wife arrived with their five year old child, Though Hari resisted, Not knowing what to do out of fear, Siva killed his wife. They took the jewels from there and escaped. I took Siva and went to his house. Is there any other way? I think there is a way at the back. Fearing that I might get into trouble... I gave the jewellery which I took here to Hari and asked him to keep it safe. Again I have stolen only my ancestor's jewellery. Hey, then correlational law? If that is the case, then think of something like you are married to Kavitha. Tell me, what's the matter? Grandma, you said you gave an audio to the cops. Can you please send me that? Mani. Grandma! Take that phone. Here it is, grandma. I sent it. Okay, grandma. Bye, grandma. Hey, didn't you listen the voice message? Not now, let's go to the shop and listen. Kathir brother is calling. Hello! Saravanan, where are you? I came out. You asked about the job, right? Come home. Okay, brother. I will come immediately. Hey, move away. Come, Saravanan. How about my sister and Kavitha? They are good. I heard about the baby, feeling happy. Why did you ask me to come? Just a minute. Hey, don't you do what I say? Should I take care of everything? -Where are you all? -Come immediately, you fools. -If any police case is filed, I will kill you all. Nowadays, many people are having this kind of lighter only. See this. Just come out. Hey, what? -Oh, no! Please listen to me. Don't hurt my grandson. -Someone come and save him. Is this Kathir? Yes. - How dare you tell me that you'll reveal this to my sister and to him? It's him! -Go to hell. Hey, what are you doing here? This is my wife's uncle house. Dammit, uncle? It's him who killed Hari. We know, sir. How? Just now we heard the voice message, sir. Go inside. Kathir! Saravanan, please be careful. -Leave me... Leave me...leave me... Hello! Sir! The accused was caught. A minor bullet injury. Come to the spot. Coming, sir. Kathir! Stay there itself. What happened? What happened? Saravana... What's this? Why did you do like this? Who are you? You were working somewhere in a tea shop, My sister got her daughter married to you inspite of me advising her. Kathir! She took me to transfer the entire property in your name. That's why, I made a plan. I took all the property myself. Hey, what? Why are you talking weird? Oh, god! Why did you kill Hari? Oh, no! Sister, I didn't kill him. He is just lying. Hey, are you cheating? I'll say. As he said, Hari has gone from Mani's house. On the way home, the bike ran out of fuel. When he went to the fuel station, he saw Kathir there. When Kathir was talking to his partner about Saravanan's house document, Hearing that, he shouted at Kathir there itself. Hey, who are you? Don't you even think a little? Don't you care about others? Who? Who are you? Oh, no! What are you doing to my grandson? Who are you all? Oh, no! What are you doing? Please listen to me. Without thinking of anything, You are shouting at the fuel station in front of everyone. How dare you tell me that you'll reveal this to my sister and to him? Go to hell. Let's go. Feared of humiliation if the family comes to know about this, He went straight away to Hari's house and thrashed him to death. Sister, he is lying. You don't believe all that. Do you have proof? Do you have warrant? Hey, it was taken from Hari's bike. He filled fuel at your fuel station. There is CCTV footage. Oh, no! Sir, whatever you asked is true. Please don't reveal anyone that I told you. My owner will expel me from the job. After hearing all this, I have come with full details. Even your wife has told that you are an accused. Sir, he is not yet married. Oh, don't you know this? He is a big fraud. Be careful with him. Sir, let's go. Take him. Hey, get up. Come. Siva a youth was arrested in murder case of a woman in Trichy. He will be produced in the Madras High Court tomorrow. Hey, when did you do this? Be quiet. Give me. Kathir's wife and child left him since he was doing wrong occupation. Anyhow they have gone, thinking why to talk about this, we didn't tell anyone. It's okay, leave it, sister. Tomorrow I want to see Kathir. Will you take me? Okay, let's go, sister. Okay. Hey, if we enquire Kathir about his family, we might know something. That's what I'm also thinking. You have only five minutes. You should talk and leave by that. Why did you come here now? You have done everything beyond me. Are you humiliating me in front of him? Why? What do you get by doing this? Is money more important to you than us? I thought of you like my father. Ask him. -Wait. No.666, Kathir. Your wife and daughter has come to see you. Go to visitors room immediately. Hey! Don't look like that, Saravanan. How are you, Saravanan? Let's go. Hey! How does my daughter know Saravanan? Oh, leave it. That's an old story. Hey, tell me. Before marrying Kavitha, Saravanan and your daughter were in deep love. Hey, don't lie. I swear, everyone knows about it. Hey, you... Finally, he is the one who played this "law of correlation" (destiny). Come quiet, I'm in confusion. Hey, where are you going? Hello! Sir, I'm calling from, "Eye 3 vision". Tell me. The doctor has fixed the surgery date to Mrs. Kavitha on coming friday, sir. Okay, thank you. Thank you, sir. Have you started? Yes, sister. The surgery date for Kavitha has been fixed on coming friday. Everything will be good hereafter. Take it. Okay, bye sister. -Bye. Go carefully. Tell me, Mani. Where are you, Saravanan? Today is my son's birthday, so we are going out with family. Oh, what is the little boy doing? He is sleeping on his mother's lap. Okay, Saravanan. Henceforth there won't be any problems because of correlation and focal point, right? Don't know, Mani. Then what are you going to do with the jewels, Saravanan? Don't know, Mani. I will call you later. Hey... Hey, Saravanan... Come, Saravanan. So happy. Kavitha told me that you are going to adopt a baby. What happened? No, mam. The baby is one year old now. Kavitha's eye surgery is fixed on coming friday. That's why, I have to think and decide. No, if someone is with us now, it will be good for me and my son. Everyone has desire. But because of some commitment they couldn't do it. Yes. You go and see. But don't tell who is that before the children. They will feel hurt. Okay, mam. Arumugam. Tell me, mam. Come inside. Coming, mam. Mam. Take them along and show the children. Come, sir. Let's go. Tell me, Mani. Hey, what are you going to do with that jewellery?
