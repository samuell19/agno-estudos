Yes, Mom? How's Andrew? He's nice, right? Gosh, how should I say this? What now? There's no connection, we can't have a conversation. He only talks about himself. "I just bought a Jet Ski. I just got back from New York." He did just come back from New York. What's wrong with that? What's wrong is that he's so proud about spending his father's money. Take pride in spending your own hard earned money. Oh you, so picky. Of course, Mom. I'm choosing a future husband, not nail polish. What am I supposed to say to Andrew's mother? Mom, I'll call you back. Yes. I have a flat tire, Mr. Sindu. Sorry for bothering you. I don't know what to do. Oh? Okay. Alright, how about I share my location? Yes. I'll wait here. Thank you so much, Mr. Sindu. What are you doing? Hold on, I'm not a bad person. Lies. It's true. It's true. - What are you doing? - No, this... Proof. I'll prove it. See, I brought a laptop. What bad person carries a laptop? A laptop thief would. That's true. One moment. More proof. Here... Balm and a heat patch. Criminals are afraid of jail, not of a cold. Need help? Can you change tires? Uh, no. - Should I check online first? - Never mind. One of my staff is on the way. Do you want me to accompany you until the person arrives? No need. It should be safe... You sure? Hi, beautiful! What are you doing? Sorry, your car's wet now. Do you want to take off your hat? Uh, no. It's okay. It's not raining in here. Yeah. If you want to put it back on, that's okay too. See, I told you. You didn't believe me. Um... My name is Erwin. I'm... Hungry. Hi, Hungry. Natalie, my name is Natalie. - Hi, Natalie. - Hi, Erwin. - Want to eat? - Yes, Sir. - What? - I'll have one fried noodles with egg. Shhh! Slowly. Sorry, Sir. I'll have one fried noodles with egg. - One fried noodles with egg. - Yes. Miss? I'll have noodle soup with vegetables. Gosh, I don't have any vegetables here, Miss. Should I plant some first? But sorry, you'll have to wait a long time. Is that okay? No need, Sir. I'll have noodle soup without egg instead. Oh, right. What was your order? Uh, fried noodle with egg. Oh, right. Sorry. Lately, I've been a bit forgetful. Even though I'm not that old. Oh. How old are you? I just turned 75. That's quite a reasonable age. Huh? I'm still young. My older brother is 85. But he's still working on the plantation, in the fields. But that's the thing, his memory is getting worse. Poor guy. You ordered fried rice with egg, right? Uh... Your clothes, you got some soup on them. Oh, thank you. It's really good. It would be better with some vegetables. Enough to feel less guilty? Yep. Do you live in Bali? No, in Jakarta. My office sent me for some marketing conferences. I return tomorrow. How about you? The same. Office business. I had a meeting with a distributor. My family is in the construction material business. Oh... Wow. You're really hungry, huh? Want another noodle soup? No, I've had enough. Fried noodles instead. - Sir, one fried noodles. - Okay. STARVISION PRESENTS WRITTEN BY ERNEST PRAKASA & MEIRA ANASTASIA PRODUCERS CHAND PARWEZ SERVIA & FIAZ SERVIA DIRECTED BY ERNEST PRAKASA - Hello? - Hello. - Busy? - No, why? No, it's... I still have a few hours before boarding. Do you want to eat together? What are we eating? Here's my order, Sir. That's how you do it, easier now. Where are my glasses? - Do you have them? - What? - Do I have them? - Yes. I don't, Sir. Then read it for me. - Oh... - It'll be faster. Fried noodles... Here they are, found them. You took too long. Alright, I'll make this. Turns out the view is amazing here during the day. Yeah, that's why. Before we eat... use this. What's that? A trash bag? No. So you don't get anything on your clothes. - I feel like an elementary school kid. - There. How does it look? Cool, like... Master Chef Pecenongan. Jerk! Enjoy your meal. That's more like it. We have vegetables now. Yes. But you gave me too much. Uh... It's okay, Sir. Use it for other customers. - This? - Yes. Just this? Huh? No eggs? Or chili peppers? Chili peppers are very expensive now. Compared to a kilo of beef, chili peppers are more expensive. Most of my customers here like it spicy. Sir, four noodles. Don't make them spicy. Yes. Excuse me. Thanks for the vegetables. You're welcome, for your health. If it's for my health, why aren't you eating any? Don't like vegetables? I do, for dinner. For lunch, not a good fit. Excuses. Vegetables are important. Fiber. Antioxidants, vitamins. Why are we discussing vegetables? What were we talking about yesterday? Construction materials. Batako concrete bricks. Let's talk about that. How much are they now? A bundle? Is it water spinach, a bundle? What then? Per cubic. You count per cubic meter. I'm sure batako bricks are originally from North Sumatara, right? "Batak-O." Invented by the Batak, right? - You're ruining my appetite. - Oh, what a coincidence. What time is your flight? You might be late. I still have some time. When we're in Jakarta, can we still meet? Sure. Later, when I get another flat tire. So I'm just your on call mechanic. But, seriously. Is it okay? Nobody will get mad? Why are you laughing? Gosh, don't guys have any other techniques? - What technique? - You always ask like that. "Will anybody get mad?" How am I supposed to ask? Ask directly, "Do you have a boyfriend?" That is, if you dare. Okay. Do you have a boyfriend? Huh? Do you have a boyfriend? What? I can't hear you. Do you have a boyfriend?! I have... I do have the intention, but I haven't found one. What? I do have the intention, but I haven't found one. What did you say? I do have the intention, but I haven't found one! Oh... What do you mean? Eat some vegetables. Grass is a vegetable, right? Grass is a vegetable. Vegetables are green. Looks like leaves. CHECK THE STORE NEXT DOOR 2 You've only been dating for two years. Are you sure? This isn't happening too quickly? So, here's the thing, Ma'am. Um, my mom... died at the age of 45. From illness. Still quite young. I feel like my dad has a lot of regrets. There are many things they weren't able to do together. So... The sooner we get married, the more time I can spend with Natalie. Turns out you're a romantic, Win. Be more like him. Why me? But it's true, Ayu. Here's the thing, Win. I'm sorry. You're an employee. Natalie is the heir to my company. You won't have a problem? Your wife will earn more than you. Did she seriously ask that? That is so me. My income from photography is way lower than Ayu's cake sales. That's why you have to obey me. Yes, My Queen. - Do you want a refill? - Yes, please. Okay. - Want a massage? - Yes, please. Okay. Yes, Ma'am. Can you please not do this now? Then, what did you say, Win? My dad asked me before to continue managing his store. But I couldn't, and that made him sad. So, if Natalie could continue your business and make it even more successful... I'd also be happy, Ma'am. Sit properly. What did I say? Just give a straight answer, you'll be fine. Yes. Did your family ever have problems with the law? Fraud? Drugs, maybe? No, Ma'am. Never. Mom, it's Mr. Nyoman, about yesterday's order. Just pick it up. Just a moment. After the store closed, what does your dad do? He is still working, right? Uh... He spends more time going to the pond, Ma'am. To survey. Location survey. I think he wants to build a prawn farm. Is he certain? That's not easy. Harvest could fail due to bad weather. And various other causes. Yeah, please pray for his success, Ma'am. How does it feel Dad? Not working? You used to be busy all the time. I'm the one who should ask you. How does it feel being busy? You used to not work all the time. You're not bored, right? Boredom could be stressful. So far, I'm still enjoying it. I can wake up late. I can fish to my heart's content. Only one thing is missing. What is it? Carrying my grandchild. Why are you talking about that, Dad? Well, that's what I'm missing. After all, you two have settled down now. What are you waiting for? Well, just pray that it will happen soon. You don't have any problems, do you? What do you mean "problems"? My God. What the heck, Dad? I'm fine, Dad. - You sure? - Yes, no problems. Dad, Yohan's not like that. He's like this green bean. Straight but short. What? What is he talking about? Are you annoyed? Dad wasn't thinking before he spoke. It doesn't mean we have to do what he wants. What do you mean he wasn't thinking? It's clear he hopes for it. Well, what am I supposed to say? Well, answer him with, "Dad, I have to discuss this with Ayu first." Okay. Let's discuss it now. Why don't you want to have children? I've told you before. It's a huge responsibility. Which part? Labor costs? Tuition fees? - Money can be earned. - It's not about money. This is a matter of an even greater responsibility. Can we raise our child to be a person... A proper human being? Our lives aren't even proper yet. But we're doing fine, Ayu. Dear... the point is I am not ready to add another human being to this world. And your dad should understand that. We'll be the ones who take care of our child, not your dad... Alright, we'll discuss this again later. Yes, when you're not emotional. Who's being emotional? Hey. You're not emotional? You're really annoying. I see you're getting thinner, Aming. Did you have a lipo-injection? It's liposuction. An injection would add more fat. Aloy, you're gray-haired. It's hardheaded, fool. Yeah, you're hardheaded. Every time, Aloy, before sucking something with a needle, it must be injected first, Aloy. He's right, you're an idiot. He's gray-haired. Han, what's with you now? My dad. My God. He seemed healthy the other day. No, my dad is healthy. He wants a child. - Huh? - With whom? A child from me. - Oh... - Oh... - A grandchild. - A grandchild. Yes. Don't you want to have children? Well, I want to. But Ayu doesn't want to? I don't think she's ready yet. You should be like Aloy, just married and she's already swollen, right? Swollen? You're calling her a boil? - Oh, how's Sarah? Healthy? - She's doing well. She's due soon, please pray for a smooth labor. So we don't need a C-section, so expensive. What makes it expensive? Well, we would need three doctors. Three doctors? What are you doing, playing volleyball? Loy, in my opinion, based on experience, too many people involved will make things harder. Too many opinions. Opinions? It's not a neighborhood meeting, Vincent. You need that many. There's an obstetrician, pediatrician, and an anesthesiologist. What does the anesthesiologist do? A doctor. Doctor Anesthesia. I didn't ask for the name, Loy. Call them Anesthesia, Claudia, or Waluyo. Whatever, but what's the doctor's job? How should I know? I'm a mechanic, how should I know what a doctor does? If the doctor's car needs an overhaul, that's my business. This fool. You said it would be expensive because you'll need three doctors. What does this third doctor do? If you've paid a lot, and the doctor only cheers for you? It's a waste of money. Better off paying us, right Vincent? Yes. Sarah, do your best! - Sarah, you can do it! - Sarah, do your best! - Sar... - Sar... Yohan, if your wife's about to give birth don't tell them anything. Aloy, do your best! - Aloy, do your best! - Aloy, you can do it! - You can see the head, Aloy! - Aloy's sperm works! Alright, Win. When the recap is complete, email it to me. We'll take it to the meeting. - Okay, Ma'am. - Alright? Oh, right. Whistle, whistle. Wink, wink. Are you okay? How was your meeting with your future mother-in-law? Oh... All good, it went well. Good, she won't regret it. You're a diligent person. Always willing to learn. Thank you, Ma'am. Although you are a bit awkward. Always worrying about people's feelings. More concerned with work than family. Huh? Don't know how to fix a leaking roof. Can't change gas tanks. Why are there so many weaknesses? Can you change gas tanks? - I can't. - Ah. - I'm afraid they might explode. - What! A man, afraid of explosions. Email me. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. They were out of the Char shiu, so I bought the ground meat. - Is that alright? - That's fine, thank you. What's wrong? Huh? No, it's nothing. You haven't told your dad yet, have you? Oh right, one more thing, Erwin. Are you moving to Singapore for work? Yes, Ma'am. I have a two year contract at the regional office. After that, I'll have the option to return to Jakarta. When Erwin returns to Jakarta his career will improve, Mom. Amen. Then what about you two? Well, I plan to invite Natalie to join me in Singapore, Ma'am. You can't do that. I need Natalie here. But I also disagree with you two having a long distance relationship. If you want to marry Natalie, you have to stay in Jakarta. Um... So, Ma'am, the opportunity... If you want to marry Natalie, you have to stay in Jakarta. I thought you already told him. How am I supposed to tell him? I refused to manage the store because I wanted to go to Singapore. Now I have to tell him that I'm not going to Singapore? I'll try to talk to my mom again. Wow, great quality. Thank you, Pete. You're welcome, Uncle. You should come to my shop sometime, I'll give you a special discount. You should do that. If not, I'll curse you. What about Amanda and Yuli? Are they doing well? Uh... Huh, what's wrong? Yuli and I are in the process of divorcing, Uncle. Gosh. So what about Amanda? Amanda will come with me. But I'm busy going back and forth, dealing with the trial. So I feel sorry for her. School is also on break. So she has nothing to do. What can I do? - All of my family is in Siantar. - Yes. If someone can help you look after Amanda, while you deal with the trial, would you like that? You would do that? Alright, everyone ready? One, two, three. Wrong direction. Kenzo... Why did you turn around? Avoiding traffic inspection? Kenzo, don't be like that. Leave me alone! Whoa, disobeying his mother. How insubordinate. Like Sangkuriang, right, Jak? Hey, the one who disobeyed his mother was Malin Kundang, Yadi. You're hilarious. You think Sangkuriang never disobeyed his mother? No. - His father? - No. Against traffic? - It's possible. - There, that's disobeying. I'm sorry, Sir. My son is troublesome. It's okay, Ma'am. Your son is very active. Usually he's calm. When he was in my belly, he rarely kicked. But sometimes he head-butted. Hey, Babe. What do you mean he head-butted? Is he a gardening hoe? ♪ Head-butt a gardening hoe ♪ What? Come on, Sir. Be brave. Come on, all citizens support you. Come on. ♪ Recklessly ♪ Amazing. He did it. That's how you do it! Awesome. Can you continue with the pictures? Why are you continuing the lyrics? Yes, yes. Come on. One, two, three... How is it, good? Oh my, your son's eyes, they're cross-eyed. The pupils gather like a grand reunion. Come on. If you're being naughty, they'll bring out their snake. Huh? Right, you have a snake? Huh? We didn't practice this, Jak. Oh, yes. We do have a snake. - He owns one. - Huh? Ah yes, a cobra snake. Albino. It has one sharp fang in the middle. It bites slowly, but nibbles fast. Shall we call the snake? Don't, don't! It's okay. I'll call him. Snakey... Snakey... Don't! I'm really scared of snakes. Dogs too. Oh, dogs too? Wait. Snakey... Snakey? Why the snake? Call the dog, Snakey. Please, don't. Are you sure? Listen to your parents, okay? Yes. Snakey, never mind. Yes, Sir. All good, continue. Okay, all good? One, two, three. Huh? Take care of Peter's child? Yes, Han. Surely after that, you'll be excited to have children. - Dad... - Han, Han, Han. Amanda is smart, funny. It will be fun. You'll do it? Gosh, Dad. Why so suddenly? I have to discuss this with Ayu. But I already said yes. He'll drop off Amanda at your house. - Huh? - Bye. Gosh. Why is it so complicated? Hopefully you can still persuade her, Win. If you don't go to Singapore, you might not get another chance, Win. Yes, I understand, Ma'am. The people at the regional office will definitely feel disrespected. They wasted their time for your assessment. Interview. Now you're saying you might rescind the offer. Yes, I understand, Ma'am. They will be upset. What's with this child? So selfish and thoughtless. Stupid! I said I understand, Ma'am. No, I meant that's what those people would say. Something like that. You better think it through, Win. Yes, Ma'am. Do you have any tips? For? For... confronting Natalie's mom. Oh, you mean how to deal with your future in-law? So you can get her approval? Yes. I don't have any. Alright then, excuse me, Ma'am. - Win. - Yes? I have tips for changing gas tanks. Want those? Maybe next time. These tips are for changing gas so they won't explode. Better than your wife exploding, because you can't change gas tanks! So lame. No way. Please, Mom. Nat, I don't have anyone else here. How can you be okay with leaving me for two years? How about this? If you still need me here... Fine. When Erwin is in Singapore, I can go back and forth. What do you say? Leaving Erwin alone there? Just for a while. When I'm in Jakarta, we'll have a long distance relationship. Long distance relationship. That's asking for trouble. Men are weak to temptation. Erwin is not like that, Mom. Oh, Nat. Hot, hot, hot... How are the cookies, Naryo? Okay? All nice, Ma'am. Hot and cute, just like me. Hey, Chubby. Did they rise enough? Ugh, this ex-bread seller again. What do you know about dry pastries? Hey, bread is also dry. Have you ever seen wet bread? I have, the one you gave me yesterday. Yeah, that fell on the ground. Don't exaggerate. I checked it. Just a little mud. Not on the nastar, over there. Let's eat together. - Wow. - Wow. Is that the fried rice that went viral? Yep. Don't they usually have long lines? Yeah, an hour. They said the salted fish fried rice is really good. Your favorite, right? Aw, so sweet. God, please save a man like that for me. Naryo's delirious again. Come on, let's eat. Try this. What's the occasion? What? Since when have you been willing to queue for over an hour just for some fried rice? On the side of the road, even. You too. What? Domestic matter, come on! - Ugh, what? - Hurry. - Ugh, what? - Hey, my hand is back here. Come on, hurry. Excuse us, Ma'am. We'll get some air. Excuse me, Sir. Can we have the fried rice? That's better. It's cold outside. We'll get sick with empty stomachs. So suddenly, I have to take care of someone else's kid? Listen first, Ayu. Any more surprises? Do I have to take care of her dad as well? Please. May I speak? Look. Actually this is a good idea. How is it good? I'm really busy right now. You said I could speak. The good thing is that after this, everything will be settled. We'll take care of Amanda. If you still... If we still don't want to have children... Fine, I promise. This will be the last time Dad asks for anything weird. Okay. Last time, okay? I promise. Pete, how are you? I'm good. Ayu. Hi, Pete. Hey, Manda! We haven't seen each other for a long time. - You're so tall now. - Yes. Come on in. If I may, I'll go right away. The trial. Oh, right. If anything happens, give me a call right away. Alright. I have to go now. Let me settle everything first. So I don't have to leave you all the time. - Okay, Dad. - Alright. There. Listen to Uncle Yohan. Don't ask anything weird. - I'll be on my way. - Alright, Pete. Hey, Dad. Yes? So I won't forget your face. Bye. Bye. I'm off. Alright, off you go. - Bye, Manda. - Bye. It's really quiet here. You don't have children? This is your room. Whose room is this, Auntie? No one's, just an empty room. We just recently moved here. Um... Want me to help you unpack? No thanks. Okay. Here's your blanket. - Okay. - I'll be in the kitchen, alright? - Okay. Thanks, Auntie. - You're welcome. If you want to take someone's picture, ask first. The person may not like being photographed. Okay, Auntie. I'm sorry. Here. No, you can keep it if you want. Okay. So you really don't have kids? Yes. God hasn't given you any? About that, I don't really know. What's clear is we don't want any. Why? I don't think I'm good enough to raise children. I'm good at raising dough. But you can't talk to dough. But afterwards, I can eat it. I can't eat a child. Just kidding. I'm not going to eat you. Because I'm not hungry yet. Hey, you rolled doubles three times. You go to jail. - Where's that rule? - Go to jail. - That's the rule for three doubles. - No. Then you're cheating. How can you keep rolling doubles? You can too if you want. I want to, but the dice doesn't. Well, that's not my fault. Your turn, where's your piece? Ouch. - First day? - Uh-huh. One sec. MISS, I'M AT THE PARKING LOT. MADAM SAID YOU SHOULDN'T COME HOME LATE. OKAY, WAIT. I'M EATING. THANKS. Here, is it too hot? - Hold it with this. - It's perfect. Thank you. I think I want to try talking to your mom one more time. Are you sure? Well, I'm not really sure, but... I have to try. Please be patient. Since she divorced my dad, I'm the only one Mom has. I don't think she's ready to part with me. That's why she's looking for excuses. With this kind of work, I can easily fly back and forth. Sure you can, but if... you're in Jakarta, and I'm in Singapore... You won't be afraid that I'd cheat? No. How come? Who would want you? Oh, is that so? But you want to be with me? - I felt sorry for you. - Oh... It was raining. You had heating patches. You keep bringing that up. You don't like vegetables. You had dorky hair. Hey, that hair took your breath away that night. Admit it, Natalie. Ah, so despicable. You fell in love at first sight. Need help with your car? My cramps are getting worse. - Take a closer look... - Whoa! You startled me. As if you'd seen a ghost! Disgusting! You want to eat now too? Yes, Auntie Ayu. Hi. Hi, Amanda. Hello. Go shower first. Later. I'm so hungry, I haven't eaten since I was a kid. Will you go to your shop tomorrow? No. I'll be baking at home. Naryo and Saipul will stay at the shop. Uh, Amanda. How was your day with Aunt Ayu? She wanted to eat me. Uh, can I take a picture of you both? Of course, Why do you have to ask for permission? What is it? She was... He said I could. I'm hungry, I haven't eaten since I was a kid! Want more vegetables? What time do you normally sleep at home? Usually around 9:00 p.m. But when it's noisy at home, sometimes it's hard to sleep. Noisy? Do you have a lot of people at home? Not many. But they fight a lot. Uh, but Uncle and Aunt seem to get along well. Do you fight often? - No. - Very often. She means not very often. Well, you know, small arguments, are normal for a husband and wife. Right? How many years have you been married? - Four. - Five. Five! Five years, but we're so happy time flies by, right? It feels like four years. Oh... Auntie, you're not Chinese? Um... - Thank you. - Sorry. Continue, Win. Yes, after that, I was interviewed in Singapore... Lin, don't forget to reschedule my meeting. Alright, Ma'am. - Continue, Win. - Yes, Ma'am. I was interviewed in Singapore with other candidates from Malaysia and Thailand. After that, I was selected to handle the Southeast Asian regional office. The process was quite long. So, if I back out now... it doesn't feel ethical, Ma'am. I hope you can understand, because this is very important to me. More important than Natalie? You are selfish, Win. What do you mean? You want everything to follow your will. You want to get married. You want to go to Singapore too. I already told you. You must choose. It's impossible for me not to choose Natalie, Ma'am. Then the decision is clear. You're not going to Singapore. We'll need to arrange a meeting between the families. Right? Look, Mom. What Erwin meant was... Okay, Ma'am. Okay. Okay, I'm not going to Singapore. Not going to Singapore? I'm sorry, Dad. Why are you apologizing to me? Well, because... I refused to manage the store because I wanted to go to Singapore. Now I'm not going to Singapore. I don't regret that. It was the time for that store to change roles. Are you okay? Well, I'm okay. Alright then. If it's meant for you, it will surely find its way to you. Right. Come over on Saturday. It's my grandchild's birthday. Didn't you just have one? Different one, that was Elizabeth's. This is Arthur's. In three months, it's Sentot's birthday. You have three grandchildren? Four soon. That's a lot. Don't come to my house for Lunar New Year. Too much angpao. Oh. It's not bad for cigarette money. Your grandchildren smoke? I do. Sir... about Yohan, his wife isn't pregnant yet? Not yet. Please pray for them. Have patience, Sir. When it comes to grandchildren you'll have them soon enough. Don't be sad. It's not that. Erwin, isn't going to Singapore. Huh? Why? Is the pilot sick? Just kidding. His future mother-in-law disagrees. Huh, not even finalized and already telling him what he can't do. What if she becomes his real mother-in-law? Oppose her. Oppose her how? Well, go see her. "Who are you, telling my kid what to do?" As if Erwin can't find another girlfriend. You know how rich people are. Oh, rich? It'd be a shame if he has to find another girlfriend. They've been dating for a long time, right? A waste of time. There's a saying. "Time is waktu." Please enjoy. - Thanks. - Thank you. How many nastar must I sell to afford a house like this? If you make nastar with two pineapple farms, it still won't be enough. Nice, isn't it? Do you feel confident, Win? Why shouldn't I be confident? Yes, there's no need to be ashamed. Look, Win. You dare to propose to my daughter? What do you have? A coal mine? A palm oil plantation? Coconut is fine too. Ouch! - Agnes. - I'm... I'm Ayu. - Yohan. - Yohan's wife. - Yohan. - Your husband is unique, yes? I'm Erwin's dad. - Ma'am. - Win. Please. Welcome to our humble home. Please. We have come here, representing Erwin's family. To propose to Natalie. Yes, Sir. We have also talked. As a mother, I'm just trying to do the best for Natalie. If they both agree, what else should we wait for? Thank goodness. Erwin and I discussed the reception. Erwin, how about it? Uh, yes, Ma'am. So... I've discussed it with Natalie. I think we want a small reception. So the cost won't burden us, especially my dad. Win. Natalie is my only child. How could we do a small event? A good friend of mine has a WO in Bali. They often handle events for celebrities. I'll arrange it, Sir. We don't need too many guests. Only 500. That should be enough. Mom, Erwin and I want to bear the reception costs together. Yes, you can. Erwin's family can handle a small portion of the cost. Excuse me, Ms. Agnes. That wouldn't be fair. If my responsibilities are less than yours. Look. We'll contribute according to our capabilities. If we contribute the same amount, when we have different capabilities, that would be truly unfair. What about the pre-wedding photos? I know Michael Sebastian. He's very popular. I'll contact him later. Mom, Erwin and I both don't like being photographed. - It feels awkward. - Yes, Ma'am. So it's better if we hire a photographer we both know. Who? My brother, Yohan. I'm Yohan, Ma'am. What have you photographed, Yohan? I've photographed... People. Oh, cakes too. My husband is unique, right? Excuse us, Ma'am. Thank you. You're welcome. How's the prawn farm? If there's anything I can help with, please let me know, okay? Yes, Ma'am. Just pray for it to go well. Excuse us, Ma'am. Thank you. Bro, come on. Oh, right. - Nat, we're leaving. - Bye. - Bye, Nat. - Bye. Why did you have to lie? Dad, please understand my position. I was cornered, I didn't think ahead. You saw for yourself, what Natalie's mom is like. I raised you to be an honest person. Yes, I understand. - But the situation... - That's enough. I'm tired. I want to rest. Until now, your dad has been disappointed? I think so, Ma'am. Win, look at me. You are a good person, Win. We've been working together for quite a while. I'm one of those people who understands your life well. Natasha's mom... Natalie, Ma'am. Natalie... She's put you in a difficult position. If I were you, I would've done the same. It's normal that your father is still disappointed. But as a fellow man, he'll eventually understand, Win. Thank you, Ma'am. You're welcome. So, your wedding. I'm invited, right? Don't you dare say no. - You're invited. - There you go. Now, can I make it? I can't come, Win. Why, Ma'am? I have to go to Solo. It's a 50th anniversary. My mom and dad. It's golden! Like the Olympic gold medal badminton winners, Susi Susanti and Alan Budi Kusuma. Alright, it's okay. I just ask for your blessing. Of course. Win. Yes, Ma'am? I'm proud of you. You will embark on a new journey. Please be at peace, Win. I'm getting married, Ma'am. Not dying. True. I mean, stay calm to face the trials of marriage. You know, two people become one... The Devil doesn't like it, Win. Two people become one and prosperous. The Devil panics, Win! Yes, Ma'am. The Devil's like that. Win, can I ask for one more thing? What, Ma'am? Please ask Pur to buy me some ketoprak. Yes, okay, Ma'am. - Win. - Yes, Ma'am? Spicy. Spicy. Okay, Ma'am. I just want to make sure. Are you sure you want to marry Erwin? Mom, why would you ask that? Of course I'm sure. If not, we wouldn't have gotten this far. This is not that far yet. You can cancel it if you want. Are you really giving your blessing or not? I just want to remind you. Our family and Erwin's family are... different. It's not easy. Yes, I know marriage is not easy. But I trust Erwin. Erwin is smart, kind, loyal. How do you know? - Huh? - How do you know he's loyal? You've only been dating for two years. Loyal? Natalie, listen to me. Men have fragile egos. They are raised with the mindset that men are the head of the family. Men are leaders. Men are greater than women. When Erwin becomes your husband. With a lower income than yours. With a lower status than yours. What will happen? His ego will be hurt. He will try to show that he still has power. And when he can't get that sense of power from you, he will look for it in other women. Erwin is not Dad, Mom. After Natalie gets married, I don't want to have to ask for your help again. I understand. Please check everything about Erwin and his family. Let me know, if there's anything I need to worry about. Alright, Ma'am. So you're still upset with Erwin? Perhaps, more precisely, disappointed. Why should he be ashamed, to have an unemployed father? Why should he be ashamed... to have a father like me? I don't think it's like that. What do you mean? Yes, he did lie. But that doesn't mean he's embarrassed, to have a father like you. He was in a tight spot. Afraid of not being approved by his future in-law. That's scary. Like me back then. Before I married my wife, her father didn't approve of me. I was sad. I tried for years. Finally he agreed? Finally he died. Dude... Then I married... his wife. - What? - His daughter. Why are you so tense? What's wrong with you? Did you choke on bait? I have some left. I'm full. I think I caught a Brazilian dolphin. Oh! It slipped! I'm sorry, Nat. Because of me, you got into a fight with your mom. Even without you, we always fight anyway. Do not be like that. She's so paranoid. My dad was not a good husband. But that doesn't mean all men are like that. Nat. Parents only want the best for their children. Yes. But sometimes parents forget. The life they try to manage doesn't belong to them. Yes, I understand. Okay then. Have patience. Congregation, please be seated. - Shalom. - Shalom. Because today's theme is about sincerity. Let's turn to Colossians three, verse 23. Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as if working for the Lord. Not for people. - You'll have a wedding? - Yes. Wow, congrats, Mr. Afuk. - Where's your fiancée? - No. No, not me, Sir. It's them. Erwin and Natalie. Oh, I thought it was you. No. But if you want to get married again, that's okay. Who knows there might be someone for you. No way. Do you have any candidates? Dad... Yes Sir, Erwin and I are getting married. Praise the Lord. I'm happy for you. What do you think, Ma'am? I like it. Good. Sir, this one's really nice. But do you have a simpler one? Oh, you want something simpler? Of course. Want to see it? This one is already great. Grande. But the size isn't quite right. Can you make it smaller? Of course, Ms. Agnes. Mom, this is my wedding. Can I please choose? I have something more chic. I'll get it for you. No, this one's fine. Okay, Ma'am. This one. Beautiful already. A simple dress like this is so cute. Cool, a foreign designer? Local. It's super cute. Alright, then use that one. Let's run away and elope. You're crazy, you want us to elope? Fine, we won't run away and elope. Just walk quickly. So much domestic violence. Let's not get married. Just cancel this. I'll look for someone else. - Auntie Ayu. - Yes? Look at this. - What's that? - Cute, isn't it? It can reduce plastic waste as well. Nice idea. Take a look. Naryo, Saipul. Look. Wow, that's good, Mrs. Ayu. Then you could add my picture. Like a storm. Sorry, Amanda. When he was a kid, a roof tile hit his head. But I agree, this is creative. This is "oligarchy," right? What did you say? Oligarchy. The Japanese art of paper folding, right? - O. - O. - Ri. - Ri. - Ga. - Ga. - Mi. - Mi. Origami. - Origami. - Good. Hey, don't repeat his gesture. Uncle, you're so funny. Can I take your photo? Of course, let's do it! That is my passion. My poor kitchen. You'll have to renovate it, Ma'am. Hurry up. - Are you done? - I'm done. Ma'am, is this all? This is everything, all done. I'm sorry that you guys had to stay late. - It's okay. - I'll give you extra for overtime. No need, Ma'am. We work sincerely. Right, Naryo? Alright, then I don't need to pay you overtime. Ma'am, my little brother is still in school. The scout uniform is expensive. Moreover the accessories, the beret. The whistle, the stretcher. Gosh. Huh, stretcher? A stretcher. An unconscious person can't run, right? Well? It's awesome, right? Does it look like the place you had your first date? Wow, it's great, right? It's amazing. - Awesome, right? - Yeah, it's great. - You two did this? - Of course. - You made this? - We ordered it. - Who made it? - The builders, of course. Oh... - Why would we build it? - Yeah. But fortunately you two met at a noodle shop. If it was at a bus station, it would be a hassle. We'll need a ticket broker here, a fritter seller here. Here, we have someone vomiting. Why do we need someone vomiting, Jak? Carsick, just returned from Klaten. And fortunately you two didn't meet at a discotheque. It would be a hassle. We'll need a DJ here, a bartender here. Over there, we have someone vomiting. Carsick, just returned from Klaten? No, drunk on ciu moonshine... The ciu is from Klaten. Same. Enough. Start the touch ups. - You brought clothes, right? - Yeah. Alright, over there. - Alright, okay. - Okay. What's ciu? It think they mean "farewell." Oh, "see you later." She knows a litre of ciu. - Looking good. - There. You look good. Great. Don't be so stiff, just relax. Just ignore me, come on. One, two... Where are you going? You told us to ignore you. I was talking to those two! Come on. There are two of us too. Okay. Ah, that's great. So cute. We're not that stiff, Nat. Hanging out at a store suits you. - I think it's genetic. - Yes. Eat the cracker. The noodles. That looked great. - Hey, you're in the way. - That was good. This one. Can you make me look more handsome? I can make the photo nicer. But to make you more handsome, I don't have that kind of skill. Good evening. Have you guys finished? Mom? Okay, Yohan. Thank you for helping Natalie. Now, let us borrow your photo studio for a while. You don't mind, do you? Meet Michael Sebastian. It's hard to schedule him. - Mom, the photo session is done. - We finished, Ma'am. Yes, with Yohan. Now let's continue with Michael. It won't take long. He's an expert. - Clean it up. - Come on, guys. Take this apart. What's with this cart? Babe, let's do your makeup. Tomorrow, you can open the shop a bit late, it's fine. Alright, I can make a mani-pedi appointment. Who are Mani Pedi? Twins? Why twins? Twins usually have similar names. Santi Sinta, Fauzi Fauzan. Back and Forth. Working on a thesis? You're not in college. Clean my nails. Goodness, Naryo. Wash your hands? Just use the faucet, you don't need twins for that. Alright. Continue your fight tomorrow. Now go home, get some rest. Come on. - Come on. - We're leaving, Ma'am. - Get some rest. - Yes. AUNT AYU So you're done with the photo session, and she... What about Erwin and Natalie? I don't know. Here. Yay, you peeled it already. Thank you, Auntie Ayu. You're welcome. - Do you want me to braid your hair? - Yes. What will you do today, Dear? I don't know. Maybe fix my light. One of the LED lights broke. Why don't you go to Aming's house instead? Play capsa. Maybe it could cheer you up. I could do that. What about Amanda? You have to go to the shop. You're right. That's why. There's no way I can take Amanda to play capsa. Wow, these are good. Gosh, Yohan. Why did you bring a minor? This game is strictly for adults. Ayu had to go to the shop, someone ordered a cake. Yes, but she doesn't have to play. Tell her to sit over there, play something else. Ming, lend her a toy or something. I don't know if this thing still works or not. You idiot. Goodness, what era is that from? Don't give her that. It's not educational. Huh?! Do you think all this is educational? Capsa is about thinking, using strategy. Just let her learn. This guy is messed up. How long will you stay with Uncle Yohan, Amanda? Until my dad's matter is done. - Next week, I think. - Oh. You still have time to learn qiuqiu. This is what happens when a child is not given milk. Shut up. I had a lot. Sweetened condensed milk, on bread. Sweetened condensed milk is not milk, Ming. This Aloy is hard-headed. It's called sweetened condensed milk. There's clearly milk in it. Yes, that was before. Now it's just sweetened condensed. They don't use milk. Do you understand? Aloy, Aloy. Loy, sweetened and condensed are adjectives, right? Like round, shriveled. Lukewarm, squishy. Sweetened condensed, what? That's right, Aloy. It's difficult to buy at the store. "Ma'am, I want to buy sweetened condensed." "What's sweetened condensed?" "I just want a sweetened condensed, Ma'am." You'll go home with sweet soy sauce. Say it completely, state the object. Not really. Nasi uduk, I can drop the "rice." "Ma'am, one uduk, please." She'll know. He's right, Aming. Mixed-mixed. Both are adjectives. The object isn't mentioned. What are mixed? Especially if it's spicy. Spicy mixed-mixed. Three words, all adjectives. Mom, I want some mixed-mixed! Spicy! You inspired him. And some bread! With sweetened condensed milk! Just sweetened condensed, Ma'am! Not sweet soy sauce, Ma'am! It used to be called sweetened condensed milk. But now it's just sweetened condensed. Because the milk content is low. Here. Straight flush, three of a kind, and a pair. Wow, she's the incarnation of the God of Gambling. Maybe she was born in a casino. Is your dad a dealer? The dealer is calling. Hi, Dad. Hi, Honey. Where are you? I went out with Uncle Yohan. Really? What are you doing? Gambling. Huh? But still, Esmeralda is better. She's economical. You look like a Ugandan hussy, Cent. Esmeralda is wheezing. Maybe she has pneumonia. Esmeralda sleeps on the floor. Keep mocking her. I'll burn all of your motorbikes. Take care. - Let's go. - Let's. Wait. Your shoelaces. Being a father suits you, Han. I can see your Hot Daddy aura. Your head is hot. Alright, we're leaving. - Alright. Take care. - Bye. Hey, Han. What? Look, Han... Ah, no way! I don't want to collect debts. Who said I want to borrow money? You're acting suspicious. No, listen first. Sarah is about to give birth. During labor, please take photos. Huh? Well, it's a trend, Han. Sarah wants the birth to be documented, it's cool. For Instagram. What do you mean documentation? Well, photos. You're a photographer. How can I take pictures of your wife spreading her legs? Don't take photos of that. The baby comes out from there. I know where the baby comes out from, not through Keramat Jati Street. I mean, don't aim for that part. Uh, I'll just wait in the car. Okay, here are the keys. Thanks. Take pictures of her happy expressions. The heartwarming moments. Her first time holding the baby. The beautiful parts, Han. Oh, then you don't need to be in the picture. What do you mean? You said only the beautiful parts. Fine, I don't need pictures. I'll have someone paint it. A caricature is fine! Sulking? What are you looking at? You want a painting too? Fine, I'll take your pictures. That's more like it. I'll pay later? Han. Three months, in installments. Thank you, Sir. Why do we need to be counseled by Father Thomas himself? Aren't there any other priests? Someone younger? We are looking for advice about life. The older, the wiser, right? I'm worried, he won't understand us. Sometimes different generations don't connect. Seriously? What are you afraid of? I'm afraid he'll ask strange questions. How could that be? Have you ever been intimate with one other? What do you mean, Sir? I mean like husband and wife. Times have changed. I don't want to judge you. But it is important for me to know from the beginning. No, Sir. Never. Praise the Lord. That's right, Sir. I don't want to. When you say it like that, it sounds like I wanted to. Don't you want it? I do, but I've been holding back... Why am I being blamed? - Who's blaming you? - Well you... There, there. It's good if that's the case. So when you two are together, what do you do? Play monopoly? Yes, Sir. He keeps losing. You're just lucky, and you roll double three times but you won't go to jail. Why should I go to jail? - That's the rule. - What rule? That's always been the rule. You roll double three times, you go to jail. Right, Sir? Have you ever been in jail? I have. Nusa Kambangan Prison. There, I met Christ. Shall we start the counsel? Why should he be ashamed, to have an unemployed father? Why should he be ashamed to have a father like me? That means Erwin lied, about his father's prawn farm. But regarding Erwin, Ma'am, I didn't find anything. Clean, excellent student in high school. Got a scholarship to Sydney. Almost a Cum Laude graduate. All good. But we have one problem. POLICE INVESTIGATION REPORT Happy Birthday, Dad. Thanks, Win. Happy birthday, Sir. Stay healthy. Thank you, Natalie. - Here, I'll prepare the food. - Please, please. Hi, let me help you. Hi. Hi. Place them here. Come on, relax. Does my face look that stressed? Getting married is complicated, Sis. Well, at least you get Dad's blessing. We both were... I guess I'll tell you another time. Just tell me. No, you'll get more stressed. It's okay. Just tell me. Okay. The story is... I... forgot the small plates and chopsticks. Can you grab them from the kitchen, please? You're annoying. Okay. Thanks. How was your photo shoot with Michael Sebastian? I bet it was awesome. I don't know, I haven't seen the results yet. Huh? I thought the photos were with you? Initially, Dad. Suddenly, Natalie's mom came with her photographer. I didn't know anything about that. I was as surprised as Yohan when they suddenly came. Dad, you don't believe me? If you lie and people don't trust you anymore, whose fault is it? What do you mean lie? You know, about that prawn farm. You told him? Let's eat. Very nice, Ayu. Thank you. You're welcome. Amanda helped as well. - Thank you, Amanda. - You're welcome, Grand Uncle. Can I take your picture? Of course. You look like a political candidate. Well, better than nothing. One, two, three. Make a wish, Dad. May Erwin and Natalie's wedding go smoothly. - Amen. - Amen. I hope I can go fishing all over Indonesia. - Amen. - Amen. Hopefully... I can get a new wife! Amen. - Ah, Pete. - Uncle. Amanda, your dad's here. Dad! I missed you. Yes, Dear. It's alright, you can relax. Everything is done. - Let's go home. - Yes. Thank you. You're welcome, Pete. Sorry for bothering you. Just a little. We had lots of fun, right? Oh, right. I have something for Auntie Ayu. Thank you, Auntie Ayu. Thank you, Amanda. - Take care. - Yes. All good? - You didn't forget anything? - No. Alright, we're leaving. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Win, Uncle. Wasn't it fun with Amanda? I feel... if you want, you would be a good mother. Amanda is a very good kid. And she's so smart. If I do have a child, I would be very happy to have a daughter like her. The problem is, I don't want a child. Amanda... won't make me change my mind. I'm sorry I let you both down. Yu, say something. - Yu. - How could you do that to me? How could I? You ambushed me, along with your dad. Made me look like a horrible person. Yu, I love you. But I also want to have children. I cant lie to myself. Is that wrong? No, you're not wrong. I'm at fault. Amanda won't make me change my mind. Look, Ayu. I feel... children are a source of joy. I just want... you both to experience it too. Yes, you're right. Children can bring joy into our lives... but joy doesn't only come from having children. I LEFT FIRST. ALOY'S WIFE HAS GONE INTO LABOR. You still remember how to come home? If I don't do gigs who will feed this family? - You? - Gigs? What kind of gig lasts until 4:00 a.m.? Admit you were just hanging out. Do you know what networking is? I have to entertain them to make them happy. You think only my band wants to perform there? If you can't help, keep your mouth shut. What? Help? You mean I have to sing again like before? Then bring Ayu along, so she'll become a drunk like you? Noisy. I told you to abort her. She was an accident. You're the one acting like you want a child. "I can be a good mother." Do you enjoy this life? We could've still had fun. Go have fun until you die! Don't come back here again! I'd rather die than come home to this place. Mom, where's Dad going? Mom, where's Dad going? It's your fault. - Mom. - It's your fault. It hurts. Mom, it hurts. It's your fault. It's your fault. Mom. It's your fault. Mom, you're hurting me. It's your fault. Mom! - It's your fault. - You're hurting me, Mom! It's your fault. It's my fault. It's my fault, it's my fault. It's my fault. Ayu? Yu! It hurts! No, don't! Ayu, Ayu... I'm here, Ayu. Honey... I'm here. Why didn't you ever tell me about this? I buried this memory deep, deep down. Forgive me. I didn't know. It's okay. Now I really understand. What do you mean? I was preparing inside the delivery room. Suddenly Sarah started bleeding. Dear... Are you alright? I was so scared, Yu. But fortunately everything was fine. Sarah and the baby survived. Yu... I love you so much. I promise I won't force you anymore. I don't want to see you suffer. Risking your life to do something you don't want to do. Thank you, Dear. WIN, HERE'S THE LINK FOR THE PRE-WEDDING PHOTOS. I SENT IT TO NATALIE TOO. How fancy. Welcome. Please come in, the rooms are ready. - Thank you. - Yes. Mr. Erwin? Excuse me, could you come with me? Miss Agnes wants to talk to you. Then it's true that your father is unemployed and Yohan was once arrested involving drugs. Yohan was... stressed when my mother died. He ended up using marijuana. Then he went through rehab for three months. That's it, he's not a bad person, Ma'am. Win... It's okay. What do you think I'm going to do? Cancel the wedding? Agreement to sign a prenup? You sign it first. The pre-nuptial agreement will follow. Uh... Shouldn't we discuss this with Natalie first, Ma'am? Natalie doesn't need to know just yet. After the wedding, then we'll discuss this together. But, Ma'am... If I sign this... I'll be agreeing to something that I myself don't know what it will include. That doesn't seem fair, Ma'am. You lied to me. Is that fair? Erwin. This letter will only cause you problems, if you two separate. Do you have plans to divorce Natalie? Let's have breakfast. - A lot of... - Ma'am, a call for you. Okay, sorry, I have to take this. Enjoy yourselves. - Bye. - Bye. Win. - Win. - Huh? - Yes? - What's wrong? No, it's nothing. Just a little nervous. Nerves. Any regrets? Yes. I regret that we didn't do this sooner. Are you sure Aunt Agnes treated Erwin like that? My dad drafted the contract. But why should there be a prenup? Erwin was caught lying, bro. Aunt Agnes must be worried, having a future in-law like that. Uncertain. His dad is unemployed. His brother did drugs. Drugs are difficult. Once you're caught, your life is over. There you go. That family's messed up. We all know how this would end. Hey, sorry. Do you have a problem with my family? Bro, relax. I'm Erwin's brother. If you want to say something, say it to my face. I didn't say anything, we didn't say anything. Do you think I'm deaf?! What's your problem?! - Then what do you want? - That's enough. - What are you looking at? - Dear... - Dear, that's enough. - Yohan, please. You're embarrassing me. Are you that ashamed to have a family like ours, huh? You had to lie about Dad, cover up my past? I'm really sorry, Win, if we have tarnished your perfect life. It's not like that. Dad, you know what? Erwin had to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. That's how much they don't trust our family, Dad. Are we really after their money? What pre-nuptial agreement? - Don't pretend you don't know. - She doesn't know anything. Honey, that's enough. What pre-nuptial agreement? The agreement I had to sign if I want to marry you. Why didn't you tell me? You didn't need to know. You don't need to know all my sacrifices to make this happen. What's going on here? Mom, did you force Erwin to sign an agreement? - You told Natalie? - I didn't tell Natalie, Ma'am. I heard you say it, Erwin. Yes, but... You promised me. What did you promise my mom? Nat, one moment. Ma'am, I promised you... What other lies do you plan to tell? Erwin, if you leave, this wedding is cancelled! Mom, you can't do that. Do you want to embarrass me even more? I'm embarrassed. Natalie, listen to me. No, this time, you listen to me. You always demand to be heard, but you never listen to anyone. No wonder Dad cheated on you. What's this?! You still won't admit it? Look at me! If I didn't marry you, you would be broke. Can I sit here? Sure. Your mom and I got married at your grandpa's house. When the guests were eating, there was a pig pen, and the door fell off. I think the pigs smelled the food. Then they entered the house. Everyone panicked. They ate pork, while the pigs watched. Forgive me, Win. Why are you apologizing? Because I couldn't be a parent who gave you wealth. - So people don't belittle you. - No, no. Dad, please don't say that. You were right, Win. I thought... If I was honest... worked hard... I would be successful. But I'm just like this. If I, have to work again, I will. So you and Natalie... Dad, that's enough. You didn't leave many things for us. But you taught us important life lessons. So we would be good people. Righteous people. I'm sorry, Dad. I've let you down. I'm so stupid. It's okay. Sometimes, when we fall in love we become stupid. That seems to be true. So, back to the pig story. - I'm sure you're lying. - No. There, there. Calm down. I feel sorry for Erwin. Alright? Bro, I'm... Yeah, yeah. I also want to... Yeah, yeah. It's alright. So are you getting married? It's not too late, Win. What can I do? Natalie's mom cancelled everything. Are you marrying Natalie or her mom? Look... About children... I'll leave it to you two. I don't want to force you. Thank you, Dad. Perhaps not yet, Dad. But who knows what the future holds. Give us time, Dad. I bought it as a gift for you. Do you still want to marry me? If you leave me every time we have problems like earlier... No, I don't want to. Nat, Nat... Nat, your mom really hurt me. - She... - Can you imagine what it's like being me? My whole life, she's been like that. Everything decided for me even at this age. Mom only sees me as a child who must obey what their parents say. Because parents always know what's best for their children. You think I'm not tired? You think I'm not hurt? Yes, I understand. No, you don't understand. If you understood you wouldn't have left me. Nat... Whatever happens, I will never leave you again. - Okay? - If not with you, who should I build my hopes and dreams with? Forgive me. Forgive me. You're so horrible! Yes, I know. - Don't ever leave me again! - Yes, yes. It's okay for you to be angry, but... please don't do that to the dress, it will get wrinkled. It won't look good when you wear it. Where am I wearing it to? You look so nervous. I'm getting married, can't I be nervous? Well, relax a bit. Wow. Seeing such a beautiful view like this... I remember being young. Oh, you got married by the sea too? No. I was lost, adrift at sea. Luckily some nearby people helped me. Praise the Lord. Yes, how fortunate. Or else, you wouldn't be here. Where's Dad? I don't know, he told me to go first. He said he'll catch up. He couldn't be at the salon, right? That's not possible. There she is. Wow. So, are we getting married? Amen, please let it happen. - Has to happen. - Be patient, wait for a little bit longer. Be patient. I look too excited, huh? - Understand? - Alright, Ma'am. May I speak with you for a moment? If there's a way for me to choose a family for Erwin... I wish my children could be born, in a family as fortunate as yours, Ms. Agnes. But unfortunately... he was born in my family. Erwin lied to you. That's my fault. He was just trying to protect my pride. So I wouldn't be ashamed in front of you. I apologize, Ma'am. May I tell you a story? When my wife died, Yohan's life became a mess. The one who saved him... Ayu. The person I rejected. Some more? Just a little. Yohan. Would you like to eat, Sir? It was difficult for me to accept Ayu. When they wanted to get married... I didn't agree. You cannot! Don't be like that, Dad. Our store was completely looted during the riot. But that isn't Ayu's fault, right? But you should understand! Why I still can't accept you marrying a native! Dad... Please, Dad. Dad. I won't ask for anything else. Only your blessing, that's all, Dad. Finally, they got married. Without me. I regret it, Ms. Agnes. The more I see Ayu's kindness to Yohan... the deeper my regret becomes. Perhaps we don't always know, what's best for them. Let them choose their own way in life. I just want to protect Natalie. Yes. Sometimes, what our children need, isn't protection. But trust. The marriage between your father and I... failed. But my failure should not determine your future. I'm sorry, Nat. I'm sorry for hurting you too. I've hurt you so much more, Nat. I thought I knew what's best for you. But that's not always the case. Is this really my mom? Forgive me. I guess I wasn't ready to lose my only child. No. You're not losing a child. Now you have two children. He's crying. I'm not crying. Come on, don't cry. So, will I have grandchildren? Of course, three if needed. Hey, hey... Why three? I'm an only child. It's not fun being alone. - But... - I Agree! Dad, calm down. We haven't discussed this yet. But later, after you two come back from Singapore. She can't give birth there. If that's the best for your career, you two should go. Alright! I will have grandchildren! Three, right? Three. - Four. - Hey! Why is the number going up each time? Stop asking! Enough. Amen. Sir, please don't say Amen. We haven't discussed this. Let her have them, Win! What are you saying? Green bean! Hey, he's my green bean. Green bean? What do you mean? So, Yohan is... Come on, let's take a picture together! Come on, it's ready. Everybody ready? Ten, nine... - The countdown's too long. - Eight, seven... His memory is getting worse. Poor guy. You ordered fried rice with egg, right? If Natalie could continue your business... and make it even more successful... I'll have a parade, Ma'am. What's wrong with your seatbelt? You are a good person, Win. The Devil doesn't like it, Win. Two people become one and prosperous. The Devil panics, Win! Yes, Ma'am. You look beautiful already. It's not educational. Huh? Do you think all this is educational? Poker requires thinking. She's a good girl. She looks like a good girl. Keep partying! - Cut! - My neck hurts. Let's wash it together. Why me? Fine, you wash it. - Let's. - Okay. Okay, we won't run. We'll walk really fast. Ouch! - Does it hurt? - She slapped me so hard! And bread! With sweetened condensed milk! You fool! And bread! With sweetened condensed milk! You fool! You were laughing from the start!
