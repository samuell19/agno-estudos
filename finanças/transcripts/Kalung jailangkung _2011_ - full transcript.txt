Where are the other guys? Hey, where are the other guys? Hey, they're all being crazy. Playing in a movie? What the hell are you doing, Ben? We were betting on the blank face. Betting on the blank face? Why not bet on football games? The winner will be sent to the Olympiad./ How's it? Ready to play 'jelangkung' tomorrow? Tomorrow, we'll go to the Ciwidey forest. But you must remember, don't talk nonsense, pee anywhere... let alone playing blank just now./ Why, Ben? You'll fall into a cliff!/ Be serious! Ben, are you serious or not? l'm really not prepared mentally and physically. l do hesitate./ May l give you a suggestion? What's that?/ Burn your muscle! Your body is 'security' but your heart is 'hello kitty'. Ben, though my body's big, it'll shrink if l sleep on the floor. You rubber snake?/ Ben, l haven't got my Mom's permission. There, let me be near you, OK. l feel scary./ You've a cell-phone? Yes, l do./ Take it out, then smash it! You prepare onion, garlic, curly red chili, and small chili. What for?/ You think you want to cook soup? l'm jelangkung.../ l'm not surprised./ Me, either. Not at all./ You lied./ You're very exciting. Very cute!/ Very cute, very cute! You surprised? This is to test you. Tomorrow, we're gonna play jelangkung. Do you dare? How come you just have a big body! You're all shit!/ Your body is big, not worth sulking. He just made his body big./ Huu... lf it's like this, l don't want to play jelangkung./ He's sulking. Well, are we all here? Who's missing?/ Kiki. Where's Kiki?/ Where? She's too long. You usually know./ What's that? You're very tacky. Shameful, you know./ Turn it off. Cricket, turn it off!/ Turn it off!/ That's a ring tone. Turn it off./ That's dangdut!/ Very tacky! What's it?/ Ben, Ben, Ben... lt's shameful./ Ben, Ben... You think it's a dim cafe?/ Ben, Ben... shameful, Ben! Cricket! Turn it off!/ Turn it off or not! Hurry, turn it off! Hurry, turn it off!/ Yeah, hello. You dirty! Cometh lather? Do you really dare? Okay then. Kiki?/ Yeah. l'm not concerned with Kiki, but the way you say 'cometh lather'. Don't you realize you've a speech defect, too?/ Shame! Yeah, it's just 'r'. But he pronounces all letters badly! Let's compete. Say 'doger'./ Doger. 'lce'/ lceth... lce doger./ lceth doger. Me, ice doger. You!/ lce, not iceth... You say ice like sneezing./ His speech is bent. Be quiet! This is my business with him. Happy learning the language!/ You don't go! Finish this first! lce!/ lceth! lce, not iceth!/ lce doger! Finally, we're here.../ Wait./ Bro, here. Ben, how much farther?/ A little further. Over there. Your zipper is open! lt stinks./ His habit!/ Who are you, sir? Doesn't matter! Why did you come here? We wanna have our holiday, sir./ And play jelangkung, sir. Please. But remember don't play at the old tomb up there. There's a local person's tomb her where outsiders can't enter. We must know that./ Remember that! Mind your mouth!/ l don't know. He was just bluffing to scare us./ Old people's standard. Just a myth./ City people don't believe that./ Let's go! Where are we going? Look, such a very big tree! Here's the key. Be careful when you're here. Thank you, sir./ You're welcome. What's that old guy?/ Very strange. Come./ Looks very scary. Ben, how come you get a house like this?/ Yeah. Scary, you know./ Scary./ This is an old house. lt's a remainder of the ex Dutch era. Formerly it wanted to be made a museum, but cancelled. Whose house is this?/ Your Grandma's. This house is probably 1.000 years already. Cricket./ What for?/ Just eat it. How come you know it's 1.000 years! Mon, this house is older than your father, right? Hey.../ What else?/ Afraid! Your hair is like boiled noodles! l feel scared to sleep alone. So, how's that? Honey, no need to be scared because l'm here. Better with me./ Don't interfere, Cricket! What's Momon doing? What're you doing, Mon? What's wrong with you?/ What're you doing? What's it? My nose hair is already long. l wanna have it cut. Thought you saw something.../ What's it?/ Shit! This is my own nose hair. Why mad at me? Oh my! This place is horror, too. lt's really the Dutch style. l can make a horror film. l'm the director and the producer. And l'm the actor. l'll do everything. Not scared! This place is really scary, how come?/ Yeah, scary. Mon, look!/ What's it?/ Look at that! What's it?/ Look!/ Where? There./ Let me see. Gees, disgusting! l'm not afraid. l wanna sleep. Watch over me, OK. Gees, disgusting...! Ben, l wanna say something./ What's it? Seems there's something in this house./ Yeah, that's right. There's something in this house./ Huh? There are chairs, books.../ Monkey! And a gorilla disguising as a man./ You're the cage! Let's just play jelangkung tomorrow night, OK? Just day time./ You stupid! Nobody plays it in the day time. You just sell cake at the market! You're a guy with no balls. And can't we play it at the cemetery at night?/ That's right. You've no guts! Scared of ghosts. lt's ghosts that are scared of humans./ l'm afraid of you. Yeah, your face is scary./ Dark! He's invisible. Dark! Your face is like sunset. By the way, where has Kiki got to?/ She eats sushi... There she is!/ Let me open it./ Please... Well, let's drink coffee first./ What's it? Where have you been? Why so late? Seems there was a small incident on the way. Well, let me tell the story tomorrow. Here. Coffee for my close brother./ That's it. You should know l was very reluctant to come here. l just wanna know how it feels like playing jelangkung. Yeah, you'll know it soon./ You really dare? lt depends on the ghost./ What do you mean? lf it's funny, l'm not scared./ Sitorus, you should know... from the old times, till becoming a DJ, there's no funny ghost. Even you as a human being, your face is frightening. l believe even a shrouded ghost will faint to see you./ Shit! You just made up stories. Oh my! This coffee is really nice. ls your coffee sweet? Sweet./ Mine is, too. How if we exchange? OK./ Here. Wait a sec. Before drinking, cheers, OK! Very good! lsn't that right, sis? You've an uneasy feeling like mine about this place. How come Benny...! He found a place inside a forest. lt's scary! Ki, lend me your charger. My cell phone is low-bat. Lend me your charger. My cell phone is low-bat! What's it with you? How come you're very scary? Don't surprise me if you're surprised!/ Sorry, sorry... What do you want?/ l wanna defecate! Borrow your charger. Big or small? Big or small? What the hell is it? The hole of the charger for your cell phone is big or small, idiot! Oh, l think.../ l think? Small! Like this! Well, l'll get it in my room. Peeping Tom, right?/ Hey, don't just open your mouth. My faith is still solid. Cricket, l'm worried about Kiki./ Why? l've been seeing her preoccupied only./ Look at her. She's like a Japanese ghost. Just tell you wanna peep on her, right? You've never put your head into a washing machine, right? l've no desire with her. l've considered her my younger sister. Unless she really takes her clothes off./ You shit! Your hair is like dry shit! What's wrong with you? Your epilepsy is relapsing? Epilepsy...?/ Here you are. She'll wake up herself soon. lt's a sin! You... look for my attention, right? You girl! How could you! What are you doing? Epilepsy, too? Yeah, l suffer from epilepsy. You have a stomach-ache?/ Yeah, stomach-ache. What did Benny do to you? He must've left signs on your body. What's that?/ Let me see! My epilepsy relapsed./ Epilepsy? lt means you were unconscious! That's it. He'd get the chance. Let me tell you. He must've taken that advantage on you. Let me see. Take off your pants. Maybe, there's a trace there. Oh, over there! He must've left the trace there!/ Hey!/ Hurry, take it off. Rather than being unlucky. What did Benny do? Seriously! Ouch! Crazy! That's true. l told you but you slapped me instead. What's wrong with you? Just made me shocked! You think l'm a ghost?/ What happened? Oh my!/ Why are you in the female bathroom? You're such a jerk! Sorry. l thought you were that Japanese ghost. But when you... you disclosed yourself. You're just a Betawi ghost. Not cool anymore./ What's that? Why come here? Why? l'll scream./ Stop!/ You're just disturbing here. Leave or not? Or l'll scream./ Wait... l came here just to tell we'll have a tour around the kampong. We're ready. Just wait for you two. Hurry up, OK? Well, l'll take a bath first./ Be patient. We'll follow you. Hurry and leave! Hurry up! What a jerk! l'm not leaving! She's already like a ghost and she's putting on her masker. And she likes to shout. She's like a lenong dancer. Just marry Momon, so you two can dance together. Fit, hurry up. Our friends are waiting. Fit...! Ki, you just called me? You... weren't sitting there?/ l took the bag from there. Hurry up. Our friends are waiting. They'll get mad. Hurry up. You're just blank. Let's go. Once again and l'll hit you! What're you doing?/ Enough, enough.... Kiki! Fitri! Come on, hurry up!/ l'm not afraid. What's it?/ Yeah, yeah.../ lt's for tonight. OK, hurry up... Hey, you behind! You! Go there! Don't disturb my life! Your shoes smell a cat's shit! Oh my! lt's very scary! Stop, stop! l wanna pee!/ Me, too. Ben, where? Just do it by the tree here./ Nonsense!/ Always pee! You're crazy. That's the old house in mid-forest. How come you...?/ Scary! Just get in rather than wetting yourself. Let's pee.../ Hey, Cricket.../ Yeah, yeah... What's it?/ l wanna pee! Just pee and wanna dance. Ben, where's the bathroom? lt almost comes! The back there./ Where? The back, on the corner there. Just find a corner./ Come with me./ l'll join you. Come. l'll follow, too. Hey, just stay here./ Where are you going? How if something happens to them?/ Just say you wanna peep. Where to pee?/ How come we do it here? lt's OK. You can do it here./ Well, l can't hold on anymore. Look! What's that?/ Food, man. That's an offering. Wow, who threw it here?/ Nice./ lt's not, you know. lt's an offering./ Healthy 4 and perfect 4. Perfect 5, stupid!/ There's no milk. Just enjoy... You three are involved! You're crazy to eat the offering. lf your bellies are full of maggots, you deserve that! Just eat it./ You're really not scared./ Don't talk too much. Here! Oh my!/ Free of charge... Until ghosts eat you then you'll be scared./ You talk or laugh? You crazy! Let's eat./ Like goats, the flower is nice. Take that. Eat more. Eat again! Swallow all! Hey! What are you doing there? You're all greedy! That offering is for the mysterious creatures here... so that you won't be disturbed. But you even ate it! lt's he who told us./ Stupid! All are stupid! Watch out! You'll bear the consequence! What's it?/ lt won't come out!/ Hurry up! What's wrong? Ben, what's this place? Why come here? This is the place. People say this place is very eerie. So, it's the right place to play jelangkung. How come? l'm scared./ l wonder.../ Yeah, it's very scary. Well, don't talk too much. Let's begin right away. Now, let's start. Cricket, your cell phone! He's even moving./ Turn it off. Cricket! Hey! Stop, stop, stop! What the hell! Be serious!/ Let's make it. Come on. Hurry up./ Wonder he... Well then, let's begin again, OK. There's a party here. Where's Kiki? Oh my!/ Ki, what are you doing? Hey, what's she doing?/ She's left behind. Ki.../ What are you doing? Come here, Ki!/ Hurry up! Come on! Ben, hurry up./ Ki... / What're you doing? Hurry up, Ki! Hurry up! Get her in!/ Move her inside./ What to do? Watch out! The head!/ Be careful! Be careful...! Lie her there./ You big shit!/ You! She's pitiful, you know./ Garlic!/ Why garlic? You wanna cook it?/ Garlic... Well, Ben, we better shorten this holiday... rather than having someone injured. lt's lucky Kiki just passed out. How if something happens? lt seems to be exaggerated. ln my opinion, Kiki passed out since she was just tired. And l'm sure after taking a rest, she'll be fine again. So there's no reason to shorten our holiday./ l agree to this. l just follow you then. But l'm very scared. l'm scared, you know./ l'm also very afraid. Kiki...!/ lsn't that right? She's fine./ Yeah.../ Yeah... Let's see... lt's nothing. But why did she scream?/ l don't know. Maybe, she was delirious./ What did l tell you? We better go home rather than having someone injured. What? Go home? You just go home with your 'f' friend. Watch your mouth!/ Enough. Ben, listen to her this time. We better go home./ Better we go home, OK. Come on! Throw away your muscle! Should l do it for you? You don't need to have fitness./ What's wrong with my muscles? What's the problem with you?/ Be patient, Ben. Help! There's a ghost in my room!/ Ghost?/ Yeah. Where's it? l'm gonna eat it./ What kind of ghost? Where's the ghost? Shit! l saw it over there just now./ Just a dream. lt's nothing there. l really saw it there./ Forget it. l'm afraid./ You just come to my room. What a damned ghost! Just dare to scare girls! Shit! Oh my! That ghost was really scary! Let's go home tomorrow./ Kiki is still sick. Wait till she gets well, then let's just go home./ That's right. But how can we sleep if it's like this? Just close your eyes... once in a while. Shit, don't hold my ball!/ Sorry, sorry, not on purpose. Why is your face like a corpse? How come you're even possessed? And l must sleep with you. Get well soon, so we can go home soon. l can't stay here anymore in this very eerie place. How could Benny find a place like this? His face is eerie. He probably wanna do harm to his friends. Why does it fall all the time? l'm scared to see your face. l must face it like this. l'm very reluctant to be in the same room with you. How can l sleep? There are just nightmares. Watch out, Ben! lf l die, l'll haunt you! This holiday is very torturing. Why does it fall down all the time? Why do you always move? Rather than feeling scared... l better cover my face. Benny, you're torturing me! What's that? Just look over there... look!/ Me alone? OK, come with me./ Yeah. Look, there's nothing, right?/ lt's scary, you know. Scary... it's you who are scared. You've asked me to come with you. What's that? What're you doing there?/ That...! What's it?/ That.../ Speak clearer!/ That...! Huh, satan! Afraid of satan! What kinds of people are you? Don't you have faith? You live long, right? l just mentioned you... you appeared directly. l was just kidding. Don't take it to the heart. Please, don't. Your kettle... No wonder l pulled it. Take it, l don't want to. There are a lot in my house. What's wrong with your face? Fell off the bike? lnjured like that. Wanna drink? Here. Let's just join. Share! Cricket's cell phone is left here. You like dangdut, too? The same! Just enjoy. Cheer up until morning. Just make yourself at home. Shit, it's you! Jerk! You shit, Mon! Oh my! What's up with you?/ Just now l saw... l saw Kuntil-father... Kuntilanak! You just have a body but you're scared of Kuntilanak. Seriously, l didn't lie to you. Why should l lie? lt's day time. Kuntilanak is impossible to appear./ Yeah, why l... How could you! You idiot! l told you but you even slapped me. Let the ghost eat you! lt's really very scary. l may have a heart-attack. There's another ghost! l'm gonna die! Cricket! Get up!/ What's it with you? What's the matter?/ That Kuntilanak is already too much. We can't let her like that./ So...? We must find a way?/ How? l know! Ancient people said Kuntilanak was scared of naked males the most. Then!? What's the matter with you? Your body is very big./ Whoa... Why laugh?/ Forward! Where's the ghost that makes us restless? Damn! Let me eat her! Mon, Mon... Over there!/ Where? What's it?/ Don't you see that? No./ You don't see that?/ Where? You nonsense! That!/ No! That's a banana tree, shit! Very big. You don't see that?/ Where? lt's near the banana tree!/ Where? No! Your eyes saw that wrongly! See, she passed out! lt was you! Are you a homo? Why say that?/ There's a hole in my butt. You pressed me. lt was you, maybe./ You're messed up! What happened to her? l wonder.../ Maybe, she saw a homo ghost./ You're a homo! You aren't serious. Anyway, from now on, we must be more careful. What's wrong with you?/ l wanna go to my room./ l'll follow. What a homo couple!/ That's right. l'm feeling uneasy. That's right! What the hell! Satan! l saw Kuntilanak! What's the matter with you? Are you an actor? Expression UP, UP! l saw Kuntilanak, Ben! Kuntilanak! Expression UP, UP! Apple! Your face is like a rotten apple. Do the casting! Stressed, everybody is stressed. But not my friends... Look, yes, yes, yes... Yeah, yes, yes... Please, help, Ben. l think you were over there. Why are you here? Very fast! Ben, you help me!/ What's wrong with you? l saw Kuntilanak!/ Yeah. You, too?/ Kuntilanak, Ben./ You saw Kuntilanak? Yeah./ Scared!/ Don't be a queer! l'm afraid./ Afraid? Shit! You're just joking. You know l also saw Kuntilanak./ Where?/ Where, Ben? Here, my right and left sides. The difference is... this Kuntilanak has chests... and this one is immature Kuntilanak./ Don't be kidding! This one is academic Kuntilanak. Stressed! All my friends are stressed!/ Ben! He just left! How come it's here? Yesterday, it was already thrown away from the tomb. Hey, Batman's trap! Hey! Don't be kidding. l'm not scared! Just like this. Jelangkung, jelangkung... Come alone, return alone. And who else will pick you up? There's a transport fee. So, it's you who's terrorized my friends so far. You smell a corpse, right? You... You're not scared! lt was passing without permission... l'm scared... l'm scared... Passing without permission... l'm scared... Japanese ghost! l'm scared... l'm scared... You deserved it now by seeing Kuntilanak! What did l tell you? This house has lots of ghosts. Stressed! l may be stressed! So, should we really go home?/ Of course! lt's you who proposed to play it! l didn't wanna play it! Mom, forgive me! Though scared, you still do the lenong dance! OK, better prepare to come back to Jakarta. lt's getting dark. You're not going?/ Let's go! l'm coming! l may beat you. What're you doing?/ l'm scared, Ben. Scared, scared... l am, too! Ben, wait for me! Ben.../ You sleep in that room. But.../ l'm sleepy. Ben.../ Over there! Go, go!/ l just wanna say 'good night'. Acting cute! Ben! Ben!/ This guy just surprised me. Ben!/ Come in! Ben.../ What's it?/ Let me sleep with you tonight. No! Remember when you slept here, your drool was everywhere. OK, l promise l won't drool anymore. How did you speak that way? Learned from whom? From Yato, the neighbor next door? Tell him to teach me later. Well, OK?/ l don't believe you. ls it OK, Ben?/ But promise not to drool again! l won't, OK?/ Sleep./ OK? Yeah. You're happy!/ l'll sleep on your bed. May God grant your kindness... Lenong, lenong.../ l'll sleep first! lnsolent! l've let you stay here. Take half! Move1 Half for me! You help, but always say 'buts'.../ You insolent! This is the border. Border. Your butt! Butt, butt! Teach your butt! Here, fifty-fifty. lf you don't like, sleep with Yato! Bro, is this a hand or a thigh? Don't pass here. You're like a newlywed guy to me./ Be right! Shit! l wanna puke first./ Where are you going, Ben? Go get changed!/ Oh the place is very eerie. lt smells incense and flowers, like in a cemetery. Let me just sleep! Ben!/ What's wrong with you?/ l'm leaving! What happened to that guy? Sorry... Still dance like that, l wonder. Scared! How's she, Doc?/ She's alright. There's nothing l should cure. So?/ Your kid is just disturbed from hallucination.

Pa.../ Ma, just calm down. Just my feeling... lt's already gone. Very tousled. Just got up? Just my feeling... lt's already gone. Where's my other slipper? How come the slippers can be lost one after another? Don't just take one. lt can't be sold. Just take it. You even wanna take the slipper. lt's OK l just wear one. Take it, take it! l just have one slipper. The other one was confiscated by satan. Who's calling at such a time? You already took my slipper. Now my hand phone, too. What do you really want? lf you wanna use it, please. But don't be too long. l just have a little credit left. You're still holding my slipper as well? Take all what's mine. Let me be poor. Take this one, too. See, let me be poor. Take it... lt's expensive! Are you all sure to call for a paranormal to cure Kiki? Huh?/ What else can we do? We already came to the doctor. But the doctor said Kiki was alright. ln fact, she still screams with no reason. OK, Fit. Believe or not, we should, we must... we have to find that paranormal... OK, relax. No need to accelerate. Shit! Wanna pee!/ Let me go to the toilet. Such a very long breath, wanna go diving? Where are you going, too?/ l don't know. What do you want?
