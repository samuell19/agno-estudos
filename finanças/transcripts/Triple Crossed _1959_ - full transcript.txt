[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ALL: Hello. [♪♪♪] [BARKING] Hi, Shorty. Did you miss me? Huh? Come on. [BARKING] [SIGHS] Boy, I'm tired. And I'm hungry too. These look so good. [SHORTY BARKING] Doggies don't get cookies either. Mm. Surprise! You again. In person, Millie, my little dilly. And I brought you some flowers. Thank you. Don't mind if I do. Hey, Millie, how about having dinner with me tonight? I have a date with Joe. You know we're engaged. You're a sucker, Millie. You know he's not true to you. He's a playboy. I don't believe you. Nevertheless, it's a fact. You're too good for that chiseler. [CRUNCH] Oh! Oh! Oh! Serves you right for lying about my Joe. Yeah, someday you'll catch that two-timer red-handed and you'll know I wasn't lying. Goodbye. Goodbye. Ooh. Goodbye. Oh. Joey, darling. Sugarplum. Baking a cake. Mm-hm. For you. Did you bag anything? Yes, sirree, I sure did. A turkey. Did you really kill it? Sure did. Now no fibs, Joey. How many shots? None. None? Hit it with my car. Hang on, Joe. [CHIRPING] Stand back. I'll get it before it flies away. The barrel must've been bent. Ooh, that makes me so mad-- Ow! Ooh! Never mind. You can take me out for a turkey dinner. Well, uh-- Oh, I forgot you're out of a job. We'll eat here. Thanks. Larry was here today. Why that two-timing chiseler. That's funny. You say he's a chiseler, but he says you're just a playboy. Are you? No. That fuzzy-top porcupine. If I catch him, I'll-- I'll brain him-- Ooh. Oh. Hey, that's good. [INTERCOM BUZZES] Good morning, Miss Lapdale. Good morning, Mr. Larry. Uh, take a letter, Miss Lapdale. Yes, Mr. Larry. I'm ready. To my Siamese representative. Mr. R. Me. Dear Me. Uh-- I, uh-- I-- Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. [LARRY AND LAPDALE GIGGLING] Hey. Wait a minute. Trying to steal my wife away from me, eh? I'll tear you apart, you philandering porcupine. You keep away from my wife or I'll tear this cucumber off and shove it down your throat. Wait a minute. I never saw your wife. Oh, yeah? I found this in my wife's purse. LARRY: Oh, that. That's my Christmas ad. I give it to all my customers. I never saw your wife. I'm engaged to three beautiful girls. Ask my secretary. Oh, well, I-- I just-- Oh, take it easy, will you, pal. Here. Sit down and calm yourself. Thanks very much. Yeah. Ah! Oh. I'm sorry. Wait a minute, take it easy. How about a cigar? I don't smoke. Well, get something to calm yourself. You want a drink? I don't drink. But I'll have a little birdseed if you don't mind. That always clams my nerves. [SWALLOWS] [CHIRPING] Say. I used to be a private detective, and as a favor to you, I'll try to find this chiseler who's trying to steal your belle. Belle! How did you know her name was Belle? Wait. You know. All women are belles. Like belle of the ball. Oh, I'm sorry, pal. I'm too impetuous and jealous, I guess. That's all right. I'll try to find this chiseler. And when I find him, I'll let you know. And when you get your hands on him, give him this, and that, and this, and this, and this, and this, there. Oh, thanks. You're certainly a pal. It's all right. And when you find him, give him this too. Oh, oh, oh. Whew. What a narrow escape. He suspects Belle and I. I gotta find myself a fall guy before he gets wise. My fall guy. LARRY: Hello. Yes, yes. I appreciate that. Thank you. Just the guy I'm looking for, Joe. Just the guy I'm looking for. Hey. What's the idea? You big hunk of blubber. What do you think you're doing? You told my girl, Millie, that I was a playboy. You're a fine friend. Hey. I just got you a job with Plotnik. Isn't that being a friend? Forgive me, Larry. Forgive me for misjudging you. I'm an-- I'm an ingrate. I hate myself. [SNIFFING] [NOSE HONKS] There, there. I got you a job selling men's custom-made underwear and novelties, and Santa Claus suits. I'll get you the card. Oh, boy. A job. Santa Claus suits. Oh, boy. I'm gonna be a-- Look, look. You're all set. Here's your first customer. My pal Moe's wife. There's the address. Gee. Gee, Larry, thanks. I'll-- I'll never forget you for this. I'm sure you won't. Hey, wait a minute. Have a sandwich before you go. Don't mind if I do. Boy, I'm starved. I'll enjoy this. [CROAKS] Ah! [SCREAMS] Here's that last bulb. I'll get this in, then I'll be finished. Oh, be careful, Moe, dear. You might fall. [WHISPERS] I hope. Why, Belle, baby. The only one I'd ever fall for is you. [LAUGHS] [ELECTRICITY SIZZLES] [SCREAMS] [LOUD CRASH] [SIGHS] Clumsy ox. [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [MUFFLED SCREAMS] Oh, Moe, what is the matter with you today? [MUFFLED SCREAMS] Good-- Oh! Ah. [COUGHS] Oh, thanks, darling. Oh, thanks, nothing. Say, you'd better finish the tree. I got an appointment and I'm late. Ah. Kiss me goodbye, darling. Ah, I'll see you later. Oh, my hat. [SCREAMS] Oh, you clumsy idiot. [DOORBELL BUZZING] Yes? Hello, madam. Larry Fine sent me regarding undergarments for your husband for Christmas. Oh, yes, he phoned me. Won't you come in? Thanks. Nice place you have here. Thank you. Silly. I also sell Santa Claus suits. Now here's the latest creation from Paris. A dilly. My, they're rather cute. Would you mind modeling them for me? I don't mind if I do. All right. You may go in there. But, Millie, it's true. You go to the address like I told you, you'll find out what a two-timer Joe really is. Is he there now? Yeah, get over there. Okay. Now to call Moe. Whew, what a long prefix. Hello, Moe. This is your pal Larry. You get over to your apartment right away, you'll find the guy that's been breaking up your home. Yeah, right now. Go ahead. Okay. [CHUCKLES] Any man would like this. You can wear it for a sun suit, underwear or anywhere. [DOORBELL BUZZING] Oh, pardon me. Well, where is he? Where is that faithless Joe? BELLE: Who? MILLIE: Don't act so innocent. You're not fooling me. BELLE: Well, just a moment. I'm gonna look for myself. No use lying to me. Larry told me he was here with you. That double-crossing skunk, Larry. Do you know Larry? Yes, and I suppose I'm gonna have to marry him after all. Over my dead body. Mine too. What was that? Well, I-- [KEYS RATTLING] I'll murder him! Moe! Where is he? I'll murder him! I'll tear him to pieces! That's what I'll-- Ow! Help. Help me out. Help. Help. Ow. Ow. Well, shrink your head. Pull in your ears. Ow. MOE: Help. Help me out. Ow. Oh. Oh. Oh, my nose. [GRUNTS] Oh, my nose. He's in here someplace. I'll find him. Where'd you hide him? Which way did he go? Thanks, buddy. Come down or I'll shoot. [JOE SCREAMS] I got him. Oh. MILLIE: Moe. Take is easy, Moe. Come on, Moe. Moe? Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry, merry, merry. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I hope you all have a merry, merry, Merry Christmas Me-me-me-me-me-me-- Joe. Oh, you snitch. So you're the triple-crosser that's trying to ruin my home, huh? I'll get you. [GRUNTS] So! Oh! Oh. I'll get you, you home wrecker. Where is he? MOE: Where is he? That dirty rat. I'll murder him. Oh! [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SQUEALING] [WHISTLES] Huh? Psst! Oh! I'll get you. I'll get you. Get in there. JOE: I'll get you. I'll get you. That's what you get for tripping me. BELLE: I don't know what you're talking about. He must've come back in here. I'll fill him full of holes. Give me that. You'll shoot somebody. Turn me loose, I tell you. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. You double-crosser. Wait-- You chiseler, you. Wait a minute, Joe. Look what Santa Claus brought you. This rat sent me here to sell underwear so you could catch me here. He also phoned me and said that Joe was here with your wife. Why you-- He phoned me too. Why you-- Oh! Why you-- Ooh! Stop. Don't hit him. Thanks. Let me do it. Good, good. Oh, doll face. Doll. Ow! You snake in the grass. You skunk. You-- Philanderer? I can't say philanderer. You mixed me up. Where was I? Skunk. Oh, yeah. You-- Ow! --dirty baboon. [CRYING] [HAIR RIPPING] You see? I'm no playboy. I think. [♪♪♪]
