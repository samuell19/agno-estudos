Aye, aye, Pippi! Why do we want all these necklaces and stuff? Gifts for the Kurrekurre islanders, of course. And I suppose these are to buy me a dress fit for a queen! [ Laughing ] There you're wrong, me little darlin'. They're to keep you out of the pot. Little girl stew is a delicacy if they're still cannibals like the good old days. Papa... save me! [ Laughing ] I'll show you! Right! Onto Alfonso! No! Hey! Are we gonna take Alfonso ashore, Papa? Of course. Aren't I the "Terror of the South Seas"? We'll ride ashore in style. Maybe they'll think I'm King Neptune. King Neptune? Never heard of him. It's time you went back to school. Oh! Fridolf. Yes, sir? Take five and learn the princess some history stuff... that'll come in handy when she's a boss like me. Count on me, sir. All right, Pippi, history. Take notes. Okay, Mr. Neilson, if I have to learn this rotten old history stuff, so do you. All right, in the beginning, there were... apples, oranges... and bananas! [ Together ] And Mr. Neilson loves bananas! [ Chittering ] Into the rigging, and down with the mainsail! It's plain as Pippi's nose, there's foul weather ahead! [ Thunderclap ] Sorry, Fridolf, I can't study anymore. They need me in the crow's nest. - [ Blowing Conch Shell, Shouting ] - [ Chittering ] - Help! Papa! - What is it, Pippi? A big wave... coming towards the ship! - Come down now! - No way now! [ Pippi ] Help! Take over, Fridolf. I've got to get Pippi down. Aye, aye, Captain. Papa, I'm scared! Lash yourself to the mast, girl! I'm comin' up for ya! [ Papa ] Hang on! Papa, I'm slipping! Hang on! If I lose you, remember the Villa Villekulla. The Gulf Stream will take you there. We'll come out on top like we always do. [ Screaming ] Help! [ Screams ] Papa! Papa, where are you? I'm drifting away toward the island. The current's taking me. Papa, it's taking me the other way. [ Papa ] Grab hold of the raft. Make for the Villa Villekulla. Papa! Papa! [ Papa's Voice ] I'll find you somehow. I love ya, Pippi. I wish some kids lived there. It would be fun to have best friends living right next door. Hello. You kids live here? No. We live in that house over there. The nice white one. Well, who lives in this dump? Nobody. It's been empty practically forever. What did I tell ya? Absentee ownership. Probably dead. We'll pull it down, and the whole plot'll develop. You can't do that! We play in that tree over there sometimes. Not anymore you don't! Come on. Take pictures of it. Lot of pictures. I'll knock it down, and we pour cement as far as you can see. Everything living gets cut down. [ Man ] It's another gold mine, boss! We're drifting in the right direction, and we're not gonna starve. [ Chitters ] Keep reeling 'em in, Mr. Neilson. Mr. Neilson and I are very grateful to you for saving us. [ Yawns ] But you've got to eat. [ Mumbling ] That's all there is! Mmm, not bad. - Blahhh! - [ Burps, Laughs ] Well done, Mr. Neilson. You might not be the prettiest monkey at sea, but you're the cleverest and the dearest. - What about me? - Okay, okay, I love you too. And now we must stick together, like the time when we were in Timbuktu. So when Papa finds his way back, he'll say, "Well done, guys." [ Mr. Neilson Chittering ] Wake up, Mr. Neilson. Another lovely day. I hope Papa made it. Don't worry, Alfonso, the Gulf Stream will take us home, just like Papa said. [ Boy ] But, Dad, why would anyone wanna tear down Villa Villekulla? Progress, Tommy. Mr. Blackhart has plans... to build all sorts of houses and a golf course and a swimming pool. Sounds nice. Maybe we should move. [ Children ] No! I don't wanna move! And what about our tree? Aah. There's plenty of other trees, Tommy. You and I'll go out and find another one together. Besides, this town could use some changes. Now, it's getting late. [ Children Groan ] Oh, come on. Time to bed. Come on. Off you go. Couple more minutes? Five minutes. Nope, lights out in half an hour. How 'bout an hour? No. Sorry. Time for bed. Time for bed. Now, you know where we are if you need us, right? Yes, good night. You'll be all right? Yeah. Love you. [ Children ] Love you. Mom says the Villa is over a hundred years old. They can't tear it down just like that. Just won't be the same anymore. I don't wanna leave here... ever. [ Tommy ] You know, Annika, there's something strange going on in there. [ Annika ] You mean somebody's in there? Or maybe even... ghosts? [ Tommy ] Yeah! Could be even a ghost. Let's go check it out. See anything? No. Besides, you can't see ghosts. Well, if you can't see ghosts, [ Door Slams ] then what are we looking for? Shh! [ Creaking Noise ] What was that? The step creaked. Don't follow so close. [ Screaming ] [ Tommy ] Look. It's up there. If I say run, run! Okay. Where? Just run. Look. Do ghosts have big shoes? Give me the bat. Can you hit a ghost? Shh. Stop asking so many questions. You see? It's nothing. Probably just-- - [ Whinnies ] - [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Mr. Neilson Screeching ] [ Screaming ] [ Screeching ] Hi. Who are you? You're not a ghost? 'Course not. The ghosts live up in the attic. [ Tommy ] We know. We just saw one. It was big and white and had spots all over it. That's my horse, Alfonso. What's a horse doing in the attic? Beats me. I keep telling him not to go up there, but he doesn't listen. Alfonso, get down on the porch, where you belong. [ Whinnying ] No way! You see? He won't listen. My name's Pippi. Pippi Longstocking. I'm Tommy, and this is my sister Annika. What are you doing here? I live here, of course. Are you gonna stay here all by yourself? I'm not all by myself. Mr. Neilson and Alfonso live with me too. [ Chittering ] [ Annika ] Oh, is Mr. Neilson your father? This is Mr. Neilson. [ Chittering ] My father is a sea captain who was washed overboard in a storm. Did he drown? Of course not. He lives on the Kurrekurre Island. He's the king of the cannibals. Cannibals? Real cannibals? There's no such thing today. [ Pippi ] How do you know? You've never been there, have you? And do they really... eat you? Yeah. Which reminds me. I'm hungry. You guys hungry? We're always hungry. [ Pippi ] Great. Who's for pancakes? [ Children Singing, Laughing ] What the heck's that ruckus over there? What could it be? You don't suppose Tommy and Annika-- No, I'll go see. ♪♪♪ [ Singing, Laughing ] Hey, Pippi! Hey, Annika! Pancakes, Alfonso? ♪♪♪ [ Singing ] [ Whinnying ] Pancakes. Something new. ♪♪♪ [ Continue Singing ] [ Laughter ] Tommy! Annika! Just what in blazes do you think you're doing? We're just having a midnight snack. Care to join us? I have never seen such a mess in my entire life! You two are going to march right home this very instant... and go to bed! And as for you, I don't know who you think you are or what you think you're doing here, but I'm going to get to the bottom of this first thing in the morning. March! [ Chittering ] Nice meeting you. Aah! [ Chittering ] Thank goodness I only have you and Alfonso to worry about. Alfonso? [ Tommy ] Her name is Pippi Longstocking. And she's come to live here. I don't know what got into you two. How could you do something like this? Here, darling. Oh, thank you. I'm-I'm so confused. That house stands empty for heaven knows how many years. Suddenly in the middle of the night, some 11-year-old terror moves in. I know. Our kids seem to love it. You should've seen them. Uh, uh, a flying horse. How do we even know that it's her father's house? You can be sure I'm going to get to the bottom of this. [ Alfonso ] I'm tired. [ Pippi ] Keep your head still, Alfonso. Hi. We're running a little late this morning. Oh, those are for you, Annika and Tommy. Thanks. A real sword. Did you wash behind your ears? [ Mumbles ] You can't expect a horse to do it for himself. Shh. He thinks he's just like us. Okay, you can go out and play now. But don't tease Mr. Neilson, or you'll have to come right back in. All right. Next on the list. Ahh, nothing like a morning bath. But, Pippi, you've got all your clothes on! That's because it's laundry day. Well, that's enough of that. There is such a thing as being too clean. You'll catch your death of cold if you stand around like that. Since when do people die from being wet? That's what my mom always says. Well, now that you mention it, I do remember one time at the North Pole when I was so frozen... after swimming with some seals and some Eskimo kids that I had to dry myself off like this. See? That was easy. Now we're ready for a game. Game of what? Rub-a-dub-dub scrubbing day. It's my favorite day. Everything's soapy, so we might as well scrub the floor. Scrub the floor? That's not a game. You wanna bet? Oh, Pippi, what a mess! Here, put these on and follow me.

She's, uh-- I don't mean to be rude, Pippi, but we're terribly late. They've got to go to the dentist. Bye, Pippi. Bye, Pippi. Wait! Here. Take these. My father got them off of an old sailor who didn't need them anymore. I don't think we can use them just now. But do come and visit. That'll be fun. Bye, Pippi. Bye, Pippi. And when was your last checkup? Get back! Watch your step, boss. Briefcase. Good morning! Nice of you to call. I'm Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Longstocking, daughter of Captain Efraim Longstocking. Pippi for short. Pippi. Good morning. What can I do for you? Selling vacuums? I'll take a dozen. Wrap them up. No, I'm not selling. I'm buying. Oh, this is me. Dan Blackhart. Blackhart's Ideal Homes. If you need it, we've got it. Well, to be very honest with you, I don't think I need anything this morning. [ Laughing ] But, you can have this wonderfully spectacular sewing machine for a dollar. I don't want your filthy sewing machine. I would like to look inside. Will there be anything else? Oh! I wonder if you'd be interested in selling this house? My home? Selling? [ Laughing ] How can you sell a home? You can't wrap it up. You can't carry it away. And you certainly can't fit it in your car. Obviously you can't make much of a living... if you're trying to buy houses other people are living in. Here's a gold coin for your troubles. Where did you get that? No big deal. I have a whole mess of them down in the basement. I just help myself whenever I need to. How did they get there? It's a long story. But I can tell you this much. It's part of the treasure from King Solomon's mines. I'm afraid you'll have to go now. It's Friday. Wash day. [ Yelling ] I'm sure you'll understand. [ Door Closes ] [ Laughing ] Who is that girl?

To play the piano without a piano takes a lot of practice, I can tell you. But how are we gonna pay? Spanish gold. Pirates' money. Pippi says you can find your own way home. [ Nickers ] Do you want to go with him? No, not me. Uh-uh, no way. [ Chattering ] He really is going home. They missed a good sale there. Hi, freckle-face. Don't you just love freckles? Not much! Well, I do. [ Pippi ] What's going on over there? Children's home kids. Come for their haircut and teeth pulling. Don't they ever have any fun when they come to town? Let's go play with them.

I don't know what I would have done if they had crashed. Honey, Pippi got them home safely as she always does. That's what's important. I've got a feeling Pippi would never put those kids' lives in danger. Do you know, she told me... that she used to ride with her father on the Wall of Death in Bangkok? And you believe that? That Pippi is the biggest darned liar that I have ever seen. And I'll tell you what. There's going to be trouble. That Miss Bannister is on the warpath. She's gonna have her way with Pippi yet. What a shame. [ Annika ] Whee! [ Annika ] Have you seen the splunk yet? I don't want him to get me. [ Tommy ] I'll protect you if it does. Be careful, and don't touch the floor. The splunk will get you. And when he does, he'll tear your legs off... and stick 'em in your ears. Do you know, since Pippi has arrived, I've never seen Tommy and Annika so happy. I never even see them anymore. I just miss our happy, little family dinners. Look at you. [ Alfonso Groans ] Come on! Then let me go first. I can't. Don't touch the floor. Come on! [ Pippi ] Get onto the couch! [ Tommy ] Now you've got to get onto the couch, Annika. Come on! I did it! [ All Laughing, Shouting ] What are you kids doing? Watch out, Mom. There's a splunk on the loose! I got it! Get out while the going's good. Well, come along before your father sees this mess. [ Annika ] We've been having fun, Mom. Pippi, would you like to come to dinner? No, thanks, Mrs. "S." I promised this fabulous swami in Chittagong... that I'd never eat out on Tuesdays, and there's nothing worse than lying to a swami. Bye-bye. Bye, Pippi. Bye! Let me give you a hand, ma'am. [ Alfonso Whinnies ] Oh, no. What are you doing up there? Looking out for a storm. Well, come down at once, please. Why? Do you have a new game for us to play? I'm afraid this will be no game. I am the welfare worker from the county. And there is a place for you in our children's home. I have come to take you there. But I already have a place in a children's home. Where? Well, look. I am a child, and this is my home. Therefore I live in a children's home. And a very comfortable one at that. But no child can live alone. No, no, no. It's unheard of. Every child needs adult supervision and has to go to school. [ Alfonso Laughs ] School! Why? To learn things, of course. What kinds of things? Reading, writing, arithmetic, history, geography, all those things that a person has to know. Well, Fridolf taught me how to count, enough to count my gold. And as for the other stuff, I've gotten along fine without it for ten years. So, I'm afraid you'll have to find children... for your children's home someplace else. Well, if you would just take ahold of that beast, I want to see what's going on inside. Sure. But if I were you, I'd wait and come back on Friday, 'cause today's splunk day and they're all over the place. I tried to warn her... sort of. [ Crashing ] That was a trap to catch a splunk. They're such a pain, always trying to steal my gold. Get away! Bug off! If I let them stay, they'd eat me out of house and home. And that wouldn't do, 'cause then I'd have to go to the children's home with you. Don't, don't, don't, don't! I don't know how to thank you and those kind people in the town for thinking so much of me. But take this and give those poor children in the home a nice holiday... with lots of ice cream and marshmallows. [ Laughing ] [ Chittering ] Oh, give it here! Wretch! Hey! She took my hat! She took my hat! Okay, okay, I'll tell you what. Maybe I'll visit Tommy and Annika's school. Who knows? Might even be fun. I love drawing and painting. Good morning. [ Chittering ] Mr. Neilson, you sure are the cleverest monkey... for painting all these beautiful pictures. Thank you very much. And the dearest. Ohh! What about me? That's enough. [ Mumbles ] Oh, hello, Alfonso. I love you too, Alfonso. I'm so lucky to have you guys. Got her, boss! Outta there! Ah, there she is. Turning my property into a pigsty. Ain't yours yet, boss. [ Laughing ] No, but it soon will be if you two idiots do your stuff. Listen. She loves those two stinking animals, doesn't she? Right, right. [ Laughing ] Hello. I'm coming. [ Tommy ] Come on, Pippi. There's rocks ahead. Don't worry. Catch! Oh! Oh, my gosh! They don't make china like they used to. Don't miss these! What a bozo! I work my fingers to the bone cooking for you, and you mess it all up! Here's yours. Oh, thank you. Isn't it great to be alive? What in the world did we do before Pippi came? Practically nothing. Fished, read comics, played ball. But now every day is fantastic. It's one of those "perodactyl" things. [ Tommy ] That's Jake and his new flying machine. [ Pippi ] Gee, I've never seen anything like that before. - He invented it himself. - You mean he actually made that thing? He calls it his autogiro. He even promised me and Annika he'd take us up sometime. Except Dad says no way. He thinks it's too dangerous. [ Man Laughs ] There it is, boss. Look, I can fly. Pippi, don't! You'll fall! You can't really fly! My papa always says that if you believe in yourself, you can do anything. - [ Ringing Noise ] - Shoot. That's Mom. - We gotta go now. We promised. - Bye! Bye. Leave it to us, boss. Come on. Let's go. Okay. Pippi, there are two official-looking guys... coming through the gate with white jackets on. Fantastic. I just love men in uniform. But policemen are the best. Ouch! Shh! [ Knocking ] Anyone home? County Animal Control. Come to fix your livestock. [ Both Laughing ] [ Chittering ] Hey. What are you doing? What are you doing? Wow! Oh! [ Pippi ] Watch it! That's pirates' gold. And anyone who touches it will turn to dust. Look, kid, we got an order to take your animals for their shots. Nobody shoots my animals. Whoa, whoa. We're not gonna shoot 'em. We're just gonna give 'em a few jabs. Yeah. Hey, that's my rope! That's it, kid! Aaaah! Okay, kid, if that's the way you want it! [ Crashing ] - Whoa! - Ohhhh! And that's the bully tree. You should be ashamed, picking on a poor little girl. Ohhh! No sense wasting such a nice day. You little monster, you! - Let's play "find the hat." - Come here, you! [ Yells ] Come and get it! Let's get the gold and get out of here. What? With her yelling her head off in full view of everyone? Get that ladder! That's the idea. The view's lovely up here. I'm gonna get that strong-armed little freak if it's the last thing I do. Then what? They've seen our faces. Here's what we'll do. We'll put her in the sack, and when it gets dark, we'll get rid of her. - Here. Don't want you to get sunstroke. - [ Yells ] Get up there! Go on! [ Mumbling ] Bravo! Well done. Isn't this fun? I do it every day. You little brat! I'm going to pull those pigtails clear to China. - Come on, kid! - [ Pippi Laughing ] [ Yelling ] Get off me! Get off me! Let go! Let go! You've had your fun. What's wrong? I thought it was just a game. When we're finished, we can have a feast of Coke and cookies. Put the ladder here, kid, and we'll call it a day. [ Men Shouting ] Hurry! Come on! Move it! Get out of my way! [ Yelling ] You idiot! Why, you little-- You go for her. Get her off that horse. - I'll get you now! - [ Whinnies ] - [ Alfonso ] I'll get you. - [ Yelling ] Let's get outta here. This is more trouble than a truckload of baboons! Oh! Oh-oh! [ Chittering ] [ Yelling Continues ] They're never gonna separate us. Uh-uh. Never, never, never! All you had to do was grab the horse and the monkey! We would've been rid of her forever! And all that money just lying there! Be back in a couple hours. Get, get down! Come on. Get out of there! It's not safe now. Come on. What are you doing up here? I just wanted to see what it was like to fly. Careful, careful, careful. It's dangerous. They could take your head off. Who cares? I once ran into a headless pirate in Istanbul. He never knew which way was up. Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait a few years to fly an autogiro. Yeah, you know, I risk my life every time I go up. Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! That's it. That's the idea. Vroom! Vroom! Is that all there is to it? No, no, of course not! Uh, see, you need these to keep you up... and the prop to take you forward. But it's really a lot more complicated than that. Well, I bet I could do it. Can I watch you take off? Sure! And feel free to come around any time. I always feel free. Thanks. Bye. Bye! [ Laughing ] My pop and I have been shipwrecked so many times... that there are only eight or nine islands we haven't been to in the whole world. Weren't you afraid? Well, there was this hurricane, and the peas flew out of the soup. And the ship's cat flew past me stark naked, and his fur landed on my fork. Excu-- What do you think you're doing? The sugar feels sensational between your toes. I'm sorry, but we just don't behave that way in this household. Sorry. [ Clears Throat ] Now, tell me, what makes you think that your father is still alive? I know he is. He'll be back soon. You can rely on that. Ahhh. I can't see a thing! Pippi, come in the kitchen. We'll wipe off your face. It'll be all right. I think I went a little too far. That wasn't funny, Pippi. Your table manners are atrocious. Listen, if I promise to practice one hour each day, will you teach me all that table manners and stuff? I'll try. Now I want the real truth. Your mother-- She is dead, isn't she? Oh, no! [ Gasps ] You see that cloud? Well, there's a little hole in it right above my house. Whenever I'm in trouble or I need advice, I see her face right about there. She always helps me one way or another. You okay, Pippi? You want to play upstairs? I can't. Alfonso's dying for a hay soufflé, and Mr. Neilson wants a banana split. Good night. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Oh, wait, oh. Hold it, kids. You hold on right there. I wanna talk to you. Just hang on there. Just hang on. Honey, I'm really worried about Pippi. She's all alone in that house. There's no one to take care of her. Look, don't get yourself all upset. Pippi is not our responsibility. This Miss Bannister, she has a lot of support in this town. I can see why. The county created the children's home for kids who are lost or have no parents. And it-- It just seems to me that Pippi fits the bill perfectly. Poor Pippi. No mother or father to look after her. We've gotta do something. Something drastic. [ Pippi ] The boxes are finished. Where do we put them? [ Jake ] Be careful how you mount them. They gotta be fixed real firm. [ Sawing, Hammering Noise ] What? Oh. Oh, this is too much. This is just too much! What the heck could she be doing at 3:00 in the morning? Can we-- I say, can we possibly have a little peace and quiet here? Go to bed! Don't fuss. You're getting rid of her tomorrow, aren't you? I wouldn't exactly say that I'm getting rid of her. But, eh, eh-- What, you don't approve? You know I don't. Not at all. [ Hammering Continues ] [ Children ] Twelve times sixteen... equals 192. [ Teacher ] Children, eyes to the blackboard, please. Tommy. Tommy? Twelve times twelve equals one hundred and forty-four. Annika? Pippi, how can I teach arithmetic with you sitting there? Please come inside. Well, I don't want to upset you. I'm just curious. I've never been to school before. Except in Wagga Wagga. That's in Australia. They chased wallabies all day long. And we had koala bears sitting in on-- Enough, Pippi. I'm afraid you can't stay there. It's disrupting the class. Children, back to your seats. I was just hoping all that learning floating around in there... might fly out here and stick to me... and Mr. Neilson. He's very bad with his numbers. Yeah. I'd like to help you, but you make that impossible. Whenever you're ready, come to school like everyone else, and I'll teach you. But now we must press on. Bye. Well, I guess we'll just have to stay stupid. Oh, dear. Thank you. Will you wait here for five minutes, please? [ Fire Truck Bells Clanging, Siren Wailing ] You have the order? Yes, yes, yes. Good. Then everything is absolutely legal. Excuse me. Is all this really necessary? I mean, she's just a child. A child? I've seen this child in action. She's totally irresponsible. But a fire engine? Now, why do we need that? Because the brat climbs up on roofs and in trees. And I've seen her up there. She is more slippery than that filthy monkey she lives with, not to mention that stinking horse of hers. Why the police? Oh, she's very strong. You should see what she did. She threw my men up in a tree. Then she lifted me like I was a baby. That's some baby, I'll tell ya. I think you'll agree we have to be prepared for anything this girl may come up with. We are agreed. Now, nobody wants to be unfair or unkind to Pippi. But I think that once she is safe in the van, then the whole town can just breathe a sigh of relief. [ Siren Wailing ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Bell Clanging ] Tommy, Annika! Pippi, they're comin' for you! The police, the fire engine, Miss Bannister! Just about everyone. I bet my father's with them too. They can't take you, Pippi. We're going to run away. Please come with us. Yeah, come with us. Mom and Dad are trying to ruin everything for us. Well, I've never run away from anything. But I can't let you guys go off on your own. So I guess I'll have to come with ya. Let's go. Good luck! Thanks, freckle-face. [ Tommy ] How we gonna run away? It just so happens I might have exactly what we need. [ Siren Wailing ] [ Bell Clanging ] [ Whirring, Clattering Noise ] Good God! Look at that! - All right! - Get-Get out! Get out! - We'll go after her! If I could fly, I could catch them! [ Siren Wailing ] Oh, my God! Keep pedaling. I'll bring it up. - Up, up, up! - Up! Up! Up! Up!

[ Nickering ] [ Sighs ] Oh, Pippi. How could you have done this to us? I always thought the kids would be perfectly safe with you. That you'd look after them... somehow. Here, boy. Come on. Come on. [ Siren Wailing ] [ Father ] Stop this thing now. Make it-- Come on. Will you please stop this dang-dong bell? Stop it! Did you find them? Not a trace. Boy, that Pippi has really done it this time. Are you sure they were flying? -Looked like a flying bed to me. -A bicycle. She was definitely pedaling. No! When it passed my place, it looked like that autogiro thing Jake built. Then let's go see that crazy flying goon! -Come on. Let's get outta here. -Stick around. Don't leave in case they come back. [ Fire Chief ] Watch out! Don't hit the horses! [ Siren Wailing ] [ Horses Whinnying ] I'm starving! What are you doing, Pippi? I learned this from a native in Borneo. Don't worry. It'll work. It'll work fine. See? It works! - Wow! It really did work. - [ Pippi ] No sweat. [ Tommy ] What are we gonna eat, Pippi? What have you got in there? Catch. I don't feel like hunting tonight. What would you hunt here anyway, Pippi? Oh, lions, tigers... and cannibals. I'm very good with cannibals. Cannibals? Here? Just in case. It's very quiet. You don't think it's too quiet, do you? I promise you, with this old gun, I'll be able to defend us. Even if we should be attacked by a splunk! [ Laughing ] Oh, I'm gonna go take a nap. Wake me if you need me. And keep your eyes peeled. [ Laughing ] [ Screeching ] [ Bird Squawking ] [ Growling ] [ Rustling ] [ Annika ] Pippi! Pippi! Pippi, there's something out there! There. What did I tell you? It could be a cannibal snooping. You can never be too careful. Wouldn't be much use running away if we're just to be served up for dinner... with carrots and parsley. I'll bet they're looking through their cookbooks right now, learning how to make us in a special stew. But I'll tell you this: If they ever put me... on the same plate as spinach-- Yech! I will never, ever forgive them. Oh, Pippi, don't talk like that. [ Distant Roaring ] [ Annika ] Jeepers! What was that? [ Animal Exhaling Loudly ] [ Simulating Gunfire ] - [ Tommy ] She shot it! - Three of them just bit the dust. Pippi, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a pirate, just like you. Swell. And we'll be the terrors of the Caribbean. We'll plunder gold and jewels and hide our treasures in a cave... with three skeletons guarding it! And we'll sing-- [ Together ] ♪ Life is a breeze We live it for fun ♪ ♪ No apologies to anyone ♪ ♪ We live on the seas We do as we please ♪♪ You've got it! And everyone would turn pale and throw themselves into the sea... to escape our bloody, bloody revenge! What about me? I don't dare become a pirate. Well, you can come along for the ride and dust the piano. - Dust the piano? - Look what I found. From a shipwrecked sailor's secret stash. [ Annika ] Thanks. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. [ Pippi Sighing ] Darn it! We forgot to brush our teeth. [ Annika ] Go to sleep. Without your help, darn it, Pippi never would've been able to build that contraption. I know. And I'm willing to help, but it's night. We'll use searchlights. Even if I could get the autogiro up in the dark, I could never land it. [ Man ] We gotta find those kids somehow. [ Man #2 ] It's all your fault. Listen, guys-- [ Man ] You gotta help, Jake, or we'll run you out of town. If you're not too scared to fly, I'll take you up at first light, and we'll look in places these guys could never go, okay? Okay. What's for breakfast? [ Pippi ] Dinosaur eggs, sunny-side up. Pippi! The plane! It's sinking! How will we ever get back? We're supposed to be running away, aren't we? We're lost. I want my mom. - We can't stay gone forever. - Robinson Crusoe did. He stayed for seven years. - Seven years? - I don't wanna stay that long. Three years, okay? Whew. It's getting hot. Wanna go for a swim before breakfast? Come on! Pippi, you still got all your clothes on! I know. It's more fun this way. They can't have gone this far! Hey! Don't forget! They have one of my flying machines! [ All Screeching ] [ Screeching Continues ] Hey, listen. I'm the killer whale, and you're the shipwrecked kids! [ Pippi ] Race you to shore. [ All Giggling ] - [ Annika ] These stones hurt my feet. - [ Tommy ] Always complaining. [ Tommy ] Come on. Oh, no! Our clothes! They're gone! Somebody's taken them. They have to be here somewhere. The dinosaur, I guess. A fair exchange for the eggs. Now you know why I swim with my clothes on. What are we gonna do? Nah. [ Whistles ] Sit down! You'll either lose your head or make us crash. There's no sign of them! Go back to the lake! If I know Pippi, she'll be finding some way back home!

[ Pippi ] It must be a waterfall, but it can't be as big as Niagara. Grab hold of the paddle! Hurry! [ Annika Screams ] I'm trying! Help, Pippi! Get it! Hurry! We'll come out on top like we always do! [ Tommy ] We're gonna go over the falls! My barrel's leaking. There they are-- down there! I'll drop the ladder! [ Tommy ] Help! [ Annika Screaming ] I think we'll make it! Help! [ Screaming ] Help! - [ Tommy ] Look! It's Jake! Help! Help! - Go lower! [ Kids ] Help! Help! [ Jake ] I'll go as low as I can. [ All Shouting ] - [ Tommy ] We're down here! - Hold it steady! - Yeah. Okay. I will. - [ Tommy ] Help! Help! Kids, kids, grab hold of it! Grab hold of the ladder! [ Tommy ] Help! - [ Pippi ] Grab hold of it! - [ Tommy ] I've got it! - That's good! Stay there! [ Pippi ] Come on! Get it, Tommy! Hold it steady! Don't move around so much! [ Pippi ] Get ahold of it! Hang on! - [ Tommy ] Then Dad dropped the rope! - And Pippi grabbed ahold of it. Then we got ahold of Pippi. We all went swinging over the treetops and fire engines. And now you're making it up just like-- [ Siren Wailing ] And everybody lived happily ever after. You know, when I grow up, maybe I'm not gonna be a pirate. I'm seriously thinking of changing it to a pilot. Pippi, I don't think you understand. You really went too far this time. But there's good old Villa Villekulla still there. Nobody's been hurt, and we all did things we've never done before, and we had a ball. [ Siren Continues Wailing ] [ Kids ] Bye, Pippi! Sleep tight! See you! Bye! See you tomorrow! [ Pippi ] You got a neat fire engine. Well, I hope you're satisfied, young lady. All those poor people out of their beds and out of their minds... because of your stupidity-- psst, psst, psst-- and your irresponsibili-- bility. [ Mumbles ] Hi, Alfonso. You okay? [ Whinnying ] You know, quite often, people go to bed too early anyway... just because they haven't had anything exciting to do. [ Groans ] I do wish I'd asked that nice man for a ride on his fire engine. [ Sighs ] Do you realize all those people... have lost time and money searching for you? Well, if that's the only problem, I've got tons of gold inside. Come on in. I don't want anybody to be unhappy, so they can each have two gold coins from the Spanish Main... to remind them of this fantastic day. [ Groans ] This place. It's still a pigsty. It's worse than ever. [ Pippi ] When you've been on an expedition like we were, you expect things to get a little dusty. You see? [ Coins Clatter To Ground ] What day is it? It's Friday. Great. I can start spring cleaning. You can help too. Hmm? Don't you realize that it's 2:00 in the morning? All normal children are in bed. Pippi, dear, you can't go on like this. You're worn out. You're dirty. [ Yawning ] And you have no sense of values. Now, I want you to listen just once-- just once. We have this home... where children like you are looked after when they have no mothers or fathers. Now, I have the power to force you-- I urge you to come along peacefully. This is for your own good. Now, please. Just try. Just, say, till Christmas? Can I ride the fire engine? If that's what it takes. Just till Christmas. [ Sighs ] Don't worry, Counselor. I'll keep my eye on her. Boy, I hope we've done the right thing. My children are just gonna hate me. They'll adjust, like we all must eventually. [ Chuckles ] Thank you for your help. Thank you. Yeah, and thank you. Mr. Settigren, excuse me. Any luck with the search? [ Sighs ] No. No. I can't seem to find any record of a sea captain... with the name of "Efraim" or "Longstocking." And the Coast Guard registry doesn't have any ship listed under the name of Hoptoad. [ Wheezing Laugh ] However, I am going to have a guard posted at the Villa Villekulla... just in case anybody gets any ideas about any empty property, just until we get to the bottom of this. - [ Engine Starts ] - [ Both Laughing ] Get off my car! [ Grunts ] [ Woman ] Class, I want you to go to work on the 12 problems I've given you... while I go to work on another little problem. [ All ] Yes, Miss Messerschmidt. Pippilotta-- If that really is your ridiculous name-- I want to know: How much is 12 and 15? If you don't know something as simple as that, you shouldn't be teaching. - I won't stand for rudeness in this class. - Then please sit down. I'm warning you, young lady. We have ways of dealing with rude, unruly children. - Haven't we, class? - [ All ] Yes, Miss Messerschmidt. For your information, 12 and 15 are 27. But if you knew, why did you ask me? Thirteen plus fourteen? Oh, about 67. No. It's 27. But you just said 12 and 15 was 27. I do wish you'd make up your mind. Ouch! That hurt! That was my intention. You've asked for it. Now, go over there, and don't speak another word till I give you permission. It's no good. They won't even let her come to the window. She's being disciplined. [ Tommy ] Poor Pippi. Do you think we'll ever see her again? Oh, I'm sure we will. [ Children Laughing, Chattering ] [ Girl ] Jennifer! Away! [ Girls Giggling ] [ Girl ] Thank you. [ Girls Laughing ] What'd you do that for? You know very well. Hey, Pippi, you'll make the pillow all dirty. In Australia, everybody sleeps upside down. [ All Laughing ] I think it's time someone told you that in Australia... it's strictly against the law to have lessons. It may happen that one Aussie kid might sneak into his closet to study a lesson, but it's too bad if his mother finds him. [ Scattered Giggling ] [ All ] Whoa! How did you do that? Arithmetic-- They don't have at all in China. If any kid knows what 12 and 15 is, he'll have to stand in the corner all day. If that's true, what do they do all day in school? Eat caramels. There's a long pipe... that goes from the caramel factory right into the classroom. And it shoots candies out of it all day long. - What does the teacher do? - Takes the paper off the caramels for the kids. You don't think they do it themselves! You're nothing but a great big liar, like Miss Messerschmidt says. And who said you could braid your hair again? Why are you so bossy all the time? Don't you ever do anything you wanna do? We were okay until you came. But why would you want to stay here? They give us food and shelter, and they take care of us. Sometimes they're nice to us, if we're good and do as we're told. [ Screeches ] What are you doing in here? Get out of my dormitory, you naughty boys. [ All Laughing ] I don't understand. Well done, Pippi. I really don't understand. Pippi! How can you make all this mess? Wait till Miss Messerschmidt sees what you've done. Just think. How am I supposed to draw a real horse on a tiny piece of paper? - Miss Messerschmidt! Miss Messerschmidt! - [ Mouthing Words ] - Come quick! Come and see what Pippi has done. - [ Boy ] Whoa! You. What do you think you're doing? I can't leave you alone for five minutes without your disrupting the class... and defacing the school premises. Back to your desks, class, and carry on with your work. You see that little hut? That's called the sweat box, where really bad children are put. Mom, I hope you're not too busy up there, you know, playing the harp and all. But you know what your Pippilotta's been going through. Why do they ask so many questions when they already know the answers? I mean, a horse is a horse. I'm so confused. If only Papa were here. Then we'd know the right thing to do. I wish he was. What? I didn't quite hear you. Get a message to him? But how? In a bottle? Oh, thanks, Mom. My problem's solved. Oh. You can go back to playing your harp now. Shh. [ Man ] Once, I had four jacks and lost to four queens. It'll never happen again, though. This little hand right here should be enough to win. Yeah. Two bucks says you ain't got-- Flush. [ Man ] Where'd you get that, huh? Where'd you get them cards? [ Object Clanking ] [ Cries Out, Muffled ] Shh. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? You're not a ghost. I'm Greg, of Gregory's Gripping Glue. And I'm very sleepy. Well, there's plenty of beds downstairs. [ Cans Rattling ] How did you get up here? You certainly didn't come through the front door. - I climbed up. - On a ladder? No. Up the wall. Up a drainpipe, I guess. I walked up. Now you're telling whoppers worse than me. Only flies can walk up walls. And spiders and lizards and me! How did you do it? I'll show you. Give me your shoe. What is that stuff? This is a very special glue. Now the other one. It sticks when you want it to, and it leaves go when you're through. I invented it, and someday I'm going to be very rich. What do we do now? Now you're going to climb up the wall. There. Go on. You can do it. [ Grunting ] Well, go on. I can't do it. Of course you can. You can do almost anything you want to... if you believe you can! That's what I always used to say. Okay. Why not?

They don't know I have this. But you can buy just about anything with it. If you'll stay awake long enough to write me an S.O.S., it's yours. It's gold! I don't want your money. What kind of an S.O.S.? To my papa. Please write: "Pippilotta in the jam pot. Come quick. Villa Villekulla." It's a little bit more difficult going down. Well, I can try. All right. I'll put the note in the bottle. Throw it down to me when I get down to the ground. All right. All right. Give me your hands. Just for the start. Turn me around. Now, Gregory's Glue won't let you down. Now, just trust it. Remember: You must believe. I'll try. Have a nice nap. And thanks. [ Grunting ] You're doing it, Pippi. This is great. [ Grunting ] Pippi, you're doing it! - I told you-- if you would just believe. - [ Gasps ] Ohh. [ Whimpering ] - [ Grunts ] - Oh. I can't move. I'm stuck. Oh. Well, just jump. Papa always says to leave room for your toes to wiggle. Here we go! Thanks, Gregory. Now, I want you to swim straight to my papa, and no stops on the way. [ Whistling Through Air ] Well, that's that. - [ Sirens Wailing ] - Oh, my gosh! [ Siren Winds Down ] Oh, my God! Fire! [ All Shouting ] [ Children ] Help! Fire! [ Gasps ] Oh. [ Firefighter ] All right! Get the hose off and get that ladder over there! Get the children out of there! Hurry up! - Please let me through! Let me through! Gregory! - Help! I'm trapped! Don't worry, Gregory! Pippi's back! [ Gregory ] The whole place is on fire! Please help! Hey, shoes, where are you? I can't climb without my shoes. [ Children Chattering, Crying ] [ Officer ] How many more inside? Oh, there are ten. Oh, that Longstocking child! Pippi, how did you get down there? My mom lent me her wings, and I flew. Oh! Can't you ever stop telling those stories, even at a time like this? There's a man up there, and he surely doesn't have wings. [ People Screaming ] Come on, kids! Hurry, hurry! Don't be frightened. Help! [ Confused Chattering, Screaming ] [ Man ] Move those hoses! Volunteers to hold the net. Come on! Come on! Come on! The ladder won't reach. Don't worry, Gregory. I'll save you. - We're trapped! - [ Firefighter ] You can jump as soon as they open the net. -[ Pippi ] Tell the Glue Man to jump first. -Glue Man? What's a Glue Man? My friend up there. Gregory, you'll have to jump first. Don't worry. I'll save them. - Now, it's perfectly safe. - He's gonna jump. - It's all right. I'll get them down! - [ Billy ] Help! Help! It's much easier than walking down a wall. What wall? You got a rope? Yeah. Right there in the back. Don't worry! It's all right! I'll get them out! Bravo, Gregory! Hi, Tommy and Annika. Oh, Pippi, I'm so glad you're okay. We came to rescue you. You'll be safe. Whoa-oa-oa! [ Chattering, Shouting Continue ] - Come on! Don't be afraid! Jump! - Help! It's Chrissy and Billy!

Now, you're gonna take this rope over there. Just jump. It's not gonna hurt you. - [ People Gasping ] - Get some water on that cable! - Well done, Mr. Neilson. - Tie the rope to something. - [ Firefighter ] We need more pressure. [ Billy ] Help! Pippi!
