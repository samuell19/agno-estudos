Come on. It's so cold. Wait for me, for fuck's sake! - Go. Jump in! - No, I don't want to. It's freezing. Shit, I have a cramp. - Fucking hell! - Coming! Put him in the recovery position. Pump his chest a little. Don't fuck him up! - Did you check the eel traps? - I want 600. I came second. There's hot toddy in the car. Come on, boys. THE HUNT Something fishy's going on here. Oh, it's you, Pelle! Are you alone? - Get him! Get him! - You're too many! Watch out! I'm dangerous. This is my new weapon, Pelle. - Hang up your clothes. - I have to go number two. Lucas can help you, then. Would you please help him? All his clothes come off. Is jumping such a great idea? - I'm done. - Can you handle it yourself? - Hello! Wipe. - Hey, watch your tone. Come here. And soap. Come on. Hi, Klara. Something wrong? - I'm lost. - Oh. Where's Mum and Dad? At home. I forgot to look where I was going. All of a sudden I was here. You still can't step on the lines? So you don't know where you're going? - No, and I don't remember the way. - That's a shame. I remember the way. Why don't we go together? I'll look up while you look at the lines? I'd like that. Is Fanny coming too? - Yes, she's coming too. - Good. She'll watch out for us. - What's your favourite dish? - Probably venison. Mine's fish fingers. Why do you work in our nursery? Well, I was a teacher at your brother's school, but then it closed. My dad says you're sad because you live alone in a big house. Does he now? Keep your head high and your feet on the ground. If you are still sulking, you can get a kick up the arse. - Did your dad teach you that? - You can get a kick up the arse. - Can I come and walk Fanny? - As often as you like. Try calling her. - Fanny! - Louder. Fanny! Come here! - Klara, where have you been? - At the supermarket. Sweetie. Haven't I told you not to run away from home? - You want coffee? - Fanny, come. - Go to your room. - Shit! - Look what I found in the gutter. - Hi, Lucas. Hi, Fanny. Who's a good girl? Hi, babe. You didn't put that thing away like you promised. Do you also leave your sporting gun lying about? I've told you, it's a rifle. It's not a sport. - Torsten! - Torsten! Young lady, you have some thinking to do. We're off to buy football boots. Don't touch the pie! I mean it! It better be in one piece. Torsten, are you coming? Drop in one of these days. We'll make lasagne. Lasagne... She'll be furious. Like that. I got it. How are things with Marcus and your ex? Everything's fine. I can tell when you're lying. Your eye twitches. - Really? - Don't lie to me, Lucas. She'll only let me see him every other weekend. Call Kirsten. Forget the lawyers. Quiet, Fanny! Then don't mention Kirsten. Stop it, Fanny! - Do you miss Marcus? - Of course I miss my boy. - Pick up the phone and call Kirsten. - Stop! - Down, stupid dog! - Stop it. Shame on you! He's unhappy that it's twelve days at your place and two at mine. I think it works fine. Can I say something? Thank you. He wants to spend more time here. He said that you were okay with it. Isn't that true? Lucas, what else could he say? He feels sorry for you. - Come again? He feels sorry for me? - Of course! - Please behave like an adult. - You have to set yourself aside. I do, damn it! He was the one who asked. You can't even keep an agreement. You're not supposed to call me. When are we supposed to talk, if you don't call, and I can't call? When can we talk then? - I'm hanging up. - No. When can we talk? Kirsten? Old rod, big rod, crooked rod, wrinkly rod... - Rod, rod, rod! - Hi, Klara. Look, Klara. A giant stiff rod. - Let's go to my room. - Massive hooker rod! - Good morning, Klara. - Good morning. - Listen, you have to take her. - You never keep an agreement! We don't have an agreement! Are they arguing? Are you sad? No, he can have a kick up the arse. If you have children, you must take them to nursery! - Shall I take you to nursery? - I'd like that. I'll let your dad know. - Hi. You're making a racket. - We can't find Klara. - She's here. Why don't I take her? - Yes, of course. Bye. It's okay. Let's go. You can look where we're going, then I'll look out for lines. You're so weak! Who wants to fly? - Me too! - Come here, then. I need a break. I'm dying here. - Me too! - Me too! - He's dying. - Yeah! - Wake up! - Come on, wake up! Who's waking the dead? Here's the hand of death. Time for fruit. We'll be right there. Clean up first. Klara... I found a small present in my coat pocket. I think you should give it to one of the boys. - It's not from me. - But it says "Klara". Then someone must be teasing you. Why don't you give it to your mum or the person who made it? And kissing on the lips is only for Mum and Dad. It's not from me. You're lying. - It's not from me. - Klara? Boys. Tidy up. And wash your hands. - Are you serious? - Yes, I am. Hi, Pelle and Janus. Hi, sweetie. Are you still here? Your mum will be here in a minute. Excited about Christmas? Do you remember the carol? Let's sing it. I hate Lucas. - I thought you were friends. - We're not. Why not? He's stupid, and he's ugly. - And he has a willie. - Most men do. So does your dad and Torsten. Yes, but his is pointing straight out. Like a rod. - Why do you say that? - Because it does. Did something happen, Klara? He gave me this heart, but I don't want it. That's no good. Then throw it away. Is Santa coming this year? Yeah... You never know. - I think he will. - If you've been nice, he will. Hi, Grethe. Hi, sweetheart. Are you sitting in the dark? I'm so sorry. I came as fast as I could. Did you have fun? Something on your mind? No, we've collected mushrooms and turds in the woods today. Sounds nice! Come on. Let's go home. - See you, Klara. - Bye, Grethe. Come, sweetie. Let's hurry home and make dinner. Okay. Wow. I'm thrilled to hear that. - Did something happen? - Bye-bye, see you! - Did you talk about it? - Yes. He wants to live with you. - He's very angry. - It'll be perfect. I'll take him to yours as often as he wants. Are you okay? You'd better talk to him. I'll go get him. Sorry. I'll just go through here. Dad? It's great. But I can't change schools before Christmas. - We'll manage. - I'd better go and see to Mum. Okay. And Marcus, be nice to her. It's not easy. - Of course. Bye. - I love you. See you soon. - Sorry. Hi. - Hi. That was my son. He's going to live with me now. Coffee... Coffee now? Here? Yes. Let's have some coffee. You want milk? No. I want it black and strong. You're supposed to be gentle, right? Do the dishes. Just like this? Thank you. - Will you clean up the playground? - Sure. - See you tomorrow. - Monday. - Tomorrow. - No, on Monday. It's weekend. I like it when we can see each other. Me too. Come here. You're sweet. You too. Let's put it here. You can't even hit the sack. It's the first time I didn't shoot anything. It really is. Perhaps it's your eyes. You might want to try these. Listen. I'll call Ulla. You bring roast pork. Eel. Black pudding. - Johan! Apple pork. - Let's just say cheers. You'll bring apple pork. Hello. It's Lucas. Hello? I can't hear a thing. One moment. Hello, Lucas here. It's me. Pussy! Pussy! I've been thinking about you a lot. - Who did you call? A bird? - Bent, stop it! Hey, I'm quietly trying to tell you, that he made a phone call to a lady! Would Lucas, would Lucas, would Lucas drink a beer? Oh surely, oh surely, oh surely he would! Oh surely, oh surely, oh surely he would. - I brought a present. - And it's not even Christmas. Come on. I'll help you. - How much did he drink? - I don't know. Lost count. - Thank you so much. - Lucas... You're my best friend. - See you. Have you got him? - Kisses. I'll call if I need you. Goodbye. Agnes... I need to tell you something. Do you know why you're so pretty? - No. - Because you don't know. - Oh, honey. - I love you. I love you. I love you. A lot. Fanny. Fanny. Fanny, where are you? Come here. Come! Thank you for the ball. I got you! First time ever! Got you! - Lucas. Lucas! - Hi. - You can't escape me. - Do you have a minute? Yeah, just a second. Boys, I can't catch you. After I drink some super juice, I'll be back. - Hi, Grethe. - Please take a seat. - How's little Marcus? - Good. He's not so little anymore. He's planning to move in with me before Christmas. I've been racking my brain, but I can't get it out of my head. A child has told me something, I need to talk to you about it. This child has a vivid imagination, but I still wanted to mention it. Sure. Who are we talking about? I can't tell you. The child says things have happened. Things meant for adults only. What things? What has happened? The child says that he or she doesn't like you. And that he or she has seen your private parts... How the hell would that even be possible? I don't know. Shit... It doesn't sound good, but don't worry. I'm not jumping to conclusions. We'll work it out. - What exactly has been said? - I can't tell you. And it's time for fruit so we'd better move on. You should take a few days off. Then we'll sort this out. Finish your shift today, and then we'll think of something. I'll do that. - Did I keep you waiting? - No, it's fine. I'm not sure how this works. Let's just get started. Yes, Klara... Can you try to tell me exactly what you told Grethe? Please tell him what you said about the heart. I didn't say anything. Is Grethe just making this up? Or did you make it up? No. Alright... Then try telling me. It's okay to tell him. Is it true that you said that you had seen Lucas' willie? Try to tell me what Lucas did. Tell me about that, Klara. - I'd like to go out and play. - You just have to answer. Don't be afraid. Ole won't hurt you. He just wants to know what's happened. Did he show you his willie here in the nursery? Did he, Klara? Klara? You are nodding. So it was here in nursery? Tell me what happened, then. Grethe said that you said it was pointing. Was his willie pointing? I think so. I don't remember. So he showed you his willie? Is this uncomfortable to talk about? Is that because you don't like what he did? Klara, you're doing a great job answering my questions. We'll be done soon. What did he do after he showed you his willie? I don't really know. Did you touch it? Do you remember? Did... ...something white come out of it? Perhaps this is too much at once. You can go back out and play. - Really? - We just need to keep an eye on her. You and I know each other, which is fine, but this is actually a matter for the police. And we need the consent of her parents. I appreciate your help. I'm not sure how to handle it. Klara has a vivid imagination. But it doesn't seem to be the case. No, it doesn't appear that way. No. Ole says that we have to report it. We have to notify the authorities. - The parents' meeting is off, then. - I don't think so. We're obliged to inform the other parents. - Where's Klara? - She's outside playing. Where's Lucas? He's also outside playing. - Shouldn't we send him home? - Yes, we'd better. Hi, Grethe. We were on our way to football when you called. - Please take a seat. - I thought it was at 7:00 pm? - Is everything okay? - We need to talk about Klara. Perhaps Torsten should wait outside. Wake up. Go and text or play some games. I'll be right out. What has she been up to, that little rascal? Something has occurred that shouldn't occur between children and adults. I haven't been able to prevent it. I'm terribly sorry. Klara has recounted sexual details about an adult. I don't believe a child would lie in that way. It sounds very confusing. What are you telling me? It seems that Klara has been a victim of sexual abuse here. Probably by someone close to you. - Sexual abuse? - The things she said... She'll probably deny everything because she's embarrassed. But... How? Let's see how bad it is. Hi. The cake is here. - Hi! Is it lactose free? - Yes. May I have your attention? We have a new item on the agenda. We suspect indecent conduct towards the children. There are indications that an adult has abused one of the children. Theoretically there might be more than one victim. You should be on the lookout for certain symptoms. Bedwetting, headaches and nightmares. This evening we'll go into details. I'll ask you to read this pamphlet. This is a very serious accusation. Yes. But there's no need for panic. We will of course follow procedures to the letter. Good morning, Marcus. Hello? Hello? - Dad... - Why are you whispering? They won't let me call you. Who won't allow you? Did something happen? Marcus, are you crying? They're saying all these things about you. I'm not allowed to talk to you. - Or allowed to move. - Who said that? Your mother? They said that something disgusting happened in the nursery. Don't listen to them. It's not true. - Who called you? - Grethe from the nursery. Just go to school. I'll talk to you tonight. - Okay. - Don't worry about it. I should have told you... Sorry. Yesterday... I was told that a kid had said I had shown him my willie. Or to her. Yes. Now Marcus' mother also knows about it. - Hi. - Hi. Boys, not now. - Is Grethe in? - I thought you were on leave. I just need to... What are you doing here? What's going on? - I need to talk to you. - I'm in the middle of something. You'd better go home. Leave Grethe alone. Grethe. Grethe, come here. Stop it. Why are you leaving? This is absurd. Don't come here when I've asked you not to. - I'm not hurting anyone. - Stop right there! - How could you do it? It's sick. - What did I do? - It's wrong to be here with you. - Let me tell you what's wrong. You called Marcus' mother, and now he's not allowed to come. What do you suppose he's thinking? I believe the children. They don't lie. You leave Marcus alone. Do you understand? You leave my children alone. Klara is an innocent, little girl. Is it Klara? Grethe, is it Klara? We'd better stop now. Let's go. What did she tell you? It's my best friend's daughter. You know that, don't you? Shit, it's Klara. I have to talk to Theo. What are you doing here? Why is Ulla in the office, crying? - You'd better leave now, Lucas. - What the hell? We have nothing to say to each other. Go. - Have you gone mad? - I might have. Off you go. Go away, Lucas. Hi, Theo. I think we need to talk. Yes... Okay. The others are asleep. Come on. Let me get a drink. I've made lemonade. If you're thirsty... Thanks. Now, listen... We have to talk about this. Yes. What are they saying? You have to ask your daughter. They don't tell me anything. It's blown out of all proportion. You and I have to sit down and figure out what's happened, and then go to Grethe before all hell breaks loose. You want me to ask Klara? Is that what you want? Of course. What do you mean? Lucas... I know my little girl. She doesn't lie. She never did. Why would she be lying now? I don't know why, but she is. - Lucas, for fuck's sake. - I didn't touch your daughter. You know that I didn't. Do you believe me or not? I don't know. - Theo, I didn't touch your daughter. - I don't know, Lucas. - He's not supposed to be here. - Probably not. - You must go now. - What did I do? What is it you think I did? Shut up! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! Bastard. Don't sit in our sofa. I never want to see you again. I'll cut your dick off. Get out! Hey, Lucas... Are you insane? If you touched my daughter, I'll put a bullet in your head. And I think you did, because she says so. Do you want to ruin my life? Do you? - Look at me! - What are you doing? - Hi, Klara. - Hi, Lucas. Klara, go to your room. Agnes! Come, let's go to the living room. Is Dad sad? He'll cool down. You know that. - Let's sit here and wake up. - Are you mad at Lucas? - Let's just sit here. - He didn't do anything. I just said something foolish. Now all the kids are talking. Honey... It's difficult to understand. But perhaps it's like this. Your mind prefers not to remember what happened. It's unpleasant to think about, but, Klara, it did happen. And we're so happy that you've told us. Right, honey? Come. Let's have some cookies. Hi, Nadja. Please come in and sit down. You've probably heard about it. We've reported the incident. We have informed the parents about the symptoms of abuse, and they've asked their children if they've had any nightmares... A number of parents reported symptoms of abuse. So we had to act. Are you seeing Lucas? Lucas has walked Klara here. They've been seen together. He's been alone with the children. In the toilets and the soft play room. Kirsten, it's me again. Please call me. She doesn't answer. Perhaps, but I need to talk to Marcus. What did they say in nursery? - Hi, Klara. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Can I walk Fanny? Okay. Of course. Does your mum know you're here? You need to talk to your mum before you come over. They say that you did bad things to me. Do you believe that too? I don't know. I don't really remember. - What did I do, sweetie? - I don't remember anymore. It's also the others. Who are the others? Klara, who are they? I'm scared. Do you want to go home? - What about Fanny? - You can walk her another day. You'd better go home now. What? What do you think? What do you mean? Do you think I'm insane? Do you think I'm insane? You'd better go. Get your things. Come... I want you to leave. I've harmed a child. Is that what you're saying, you idiot? Get out. Out! - Look, it's snowing. - Right on the elf. Yes. Let's put this one on the lake. Yes. They're skating. - Where's he going? - You decide. Here. Yes. And this one up there... Then he can see everything. Shouldn't he join the others? It's snowing! Don't you want to see it? - I'm coming. - It's so pretty! Don't get cold. What the hell? Marcus? Is it you? - Sorry. Come here. - You scared me. - I didn't mean to. Are you okay? - Yes. Hi, Fanny, old girl. - Does Mum know you're here? - Yes. - Where the hell is the key? - I gave it to someone. - Are you hungry? - Yes. - What a mess. It looks like shit. - Come here... Stop it already. Mum suggested that I drop by to say hello. - Shouldn't you be in school? - Well... I took a couple of days off. You know that things aren't normal around here. I've been fired. The police are involved, but they tell me bugger all. I'm going crazy. Mum doesn't know you're here, does she? - Does she? - Fuck, man. I'm crying again... - Do you want to talk about it? - No. - It's okay. - I'll pull myself together. It's ridiculous, man. - Hi. - Hi. Well, if it isn't my godson. Hi, Marcus. - Hi. - Do you have time to be here? - The air is a little dry in here. - Coffee? Yeah. Did you talk to the police? What did they say? They asked a bunch of questions. Evidently, I've touched other kids as well. - It's insane. - Completely. What? Bloody hell, you didn't do anything! It's all of them now. It's Johan, it's Bent... They've gone raving mad. You've always put up with too much. I've told you before. Alright, Fanny. Kirsten! Yes. Still got it! I don't know... Thanks. It'll be alright. Marcus is here now... Neglecting to pour his godfather a cup of coffee. - What about your hunting license? - October 16th. The day when men become mice, and mice become men. Call Mum and say you're here. And Marcus? If she flares up, I'll put her in her place. - That'll be 269.50. - Here you go. - Thank you. Here's 30.50. - Thanks. - Hi, Marcus. Is your dad with you? - No. Tell him that neither of you are welcome here anymore. - Why? - We have other customers. You're not welcome. - What's going on? - Is that your son? Can I...? Call Mum and tell her to pick you up. I've been arrested. I need to go. Are you okay? Jump in. The opposite seat. Fuck, man! - Hi, Marcus. - Do you have a key to our house? A key? I don't think so. - I'm off, then. - Marcus, are you okay? - Yes. - Listen... We know they picked up your dad. Can I have a word with you? Can I have a word? Yes, but we... Come on in. Are you hungry? Go and say hello to Marcus. Klara, can you find the mugs? - Hi, Marcus. - Hi. Well... See you. Hi! He's sat in there... We can give you a lift. Or call your mum. Marcus, are you okay? Are you okay? I just wanted to ask if you'd help my dad? Help your dad? How? Could you think it all through again? You're such a good boy, and I understand your feelings. You shouldn't pay for his mistakes. But he hasn't done what you say. - Honey, go to your room. - I want to tell her something. - Hi, Klara. - Hi. Are you doing all right? - Why are you lying about my dad? - I'm not. - Let's go, Klara. - I just want to talk... - Let go! - Stop it! - Don't touch her. - You're out of here. - I've had it with you. - I just want to talk to her. - Why do you lie about my dad, bitch? - Oh no, you didn't! - Get him out of here. - I want to talk to her! Enough already. What the hell? Johan, for fuck's sake! Stop it! Stop it. Get away from him! Get up and go home. - Go home. - Fucking assholes! Come on. Fucking assholes! Hi, Marcus. Good to see you. Come on. You're exhausted. - Did someone hit you? - No. Young ladies, keep it down. Some relatives are staying over. Come on, Marcus. My two sisters. You met them when you were a child. - I haven't seen you for a long time. - We call them Chip and Dale. They're cracking nuts. My old man is helping your dad. This is Lucas' boy, Marcus. Elias and Erik. My brothers in law. I'm Erik. This bastard is Elias. - Sit down. Get him some water. - Are you thirsty? - Is tap water okay? - Thanks. I've spoken to your mum. Remember to phone home. Agreed? Do you know what's happening to Dad? What did dad say? He said that Lucas has a preliminary hearing tomorrow. At 8:30 am. There are two possible outcomes. Either the judge confirms the remand. Or he finds no basis for keeping him. What do you think will happen? I don't know. Apparently, all the children are telling the same story. They describe your basement, the wallpaper, the colour of the sofa. But when the police searched your house this morning, they discovered what, Marcus? - That we don't have a basement. - Exactly. - What does that mean? - That they don't have a basement! - What does it mean for Lucas? - It means there's still hope. It's common for children to describe non-existing details. I don't know if it's their imagination, or they pick it up from each other or from their parents. It's always assumed that children tell the truth. And unfortunately, very often they do. - Now what? - We'll have to wait and see. They'll call us tomorrow. Good morning, lad. Sleep well? I've brought you bread, cheese and coffee. Thanks. I need to talk to you. I'm your godfather, and you can count on me. No matter what happens. Okay? I've just spoken to your dad. It looks good. - He's on his way in a taxi. - What? They let him go. Eat your bread and drink your coffee. Then we'll go downstairs and welcome your dad. Hey! If you fondle your kid, you'll go back to jail. We've got bacon and eggs. It won't eat itself. - Come on. - It's good to see you. Fanny! Hi, Fanny-girl. It's not too messy. You two, grab a shovel and dig a basement. - Fanny has peed on the floor. - No. It's probably the police. - Fanny! - She'll be here in a minute. Do you want me to wash the knickers I found? - Do you? - What's your point? Nothing. I just asked if you want them washed. - Yes, if you can find them. - I will, in a minute. If you put them in the wash. Are you seeing each other? I thought so. Then all this happened. I wanted you to meet her, but we'll see. - Do you have a girlfriend? - No, it's not my thing. - Having a girlfriend? - No. - I remember Jasmin. - That's more than a year ago. Stay down. Don't move. Hello! Hello! What's that? - Dad, what is it? - Go back in, Marcus. Let's go back in. - Come on in. - Forget it, man. - You're dead! - Stop it. - Relax... - Fucking dead! Let go of me! - Stop it! - I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Bring her in. She's cold. Lucas? I'd like to be alone. Where's Marcus? - You sent him back to his mum? - Yes. - Please leave, Bruun. - Come on in. Go home, when I tell you to! Just go. - Here you go. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Per. - I'd like two chops. - We don't have chops. - Sorry, I mean those pork chops. - You can't buy anything here. - I have a right to shop here. - I want you to leave. - You need to leave. Scram. - I want two chops. Off you go. Don't come here. - You're not welcome. - You can't hit a person like that. You have to leave now. - Is it normal to hit someone like that? - Get out. I can walk! - I need my stuff. - Get out! Now! - Get him out. - Not a moment too soon. Get out! Thank you for coming. Get lost. Bugger off. Don't come here ever again. Stay away. Didn't I tell you to get lost? I won't tell you again. I just want to say something. - Fuck! Shit, that hurts. - What the hell? - Can I have my things, please? - Just give him his groceries. Fucking hell. That's 45.50. Good God, it's Lucas. Look at him. He's a mess. - I'll go and speak to him. - Let's stay here until he's gone. Where's Fanny? I don't know. Shit... CHRISTMAS EVE I'd like to go in. A warm welcome to you all. And merry Christmas. This is our Christmas service. As always, we'll open with a prayer. I have come into this your house to hear what you say to me, God the Father, you, Lord Jesus, good Holy Spirit, in life and death my comforter. Open my heart by your Holy Spirit, for the sake of Jesus Christ. So that I may learn to repent my sins and to believe in Jesus, and every day to grow in holy life and living. Hear me and grant this, Oh God, through Jesus Christ. Amen. Christmas Eve is about Baby Jesus. The son of God is born. - What's wrong? - I can tell by looking at him. Tell what? We should think about it during the Lord's Prayer. Father, you say. And then it happens. You have become a child of God. It is starting now. Christmas time is a time for children. This year we want to emphasize the gospel for Christmas Day. We've invited the nursery choir who have been practising, so we may enjoy the hymn "A Child is Born in Bethlehem". Come on, stand over here. Klara, you stand here. Take a step forward. What are you saying? - Have you got something to say to me? - Stop it, Lucas. - You want to tell me something? - Relax, Lucas! The whole town is listening. Tell me! - You psycho! - What do you want to say? - Stop it, you fucking psychopath! - I want a word with Theo. Look into my eyes. Look me in the eyes. What do you see? Do you see anything? Nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing. You leave me alone now. Leave me alone now, Theo. Then I'll go. Thank you. - You're the lucky one. - You've had enough presents. It's exactly what you wished for. I've got her. Fanny... Lucas... Hi, Lucas. It was not supposed to happen. Klara, honey... It's not Lucas. It's just Dad. - Dad, are you crying? - No. The world is full of evil. But if we hold on to each other, it goes away. Are you really sad? No. You know, that Lucas is my very best friend. We rode our mopeds... We stole apples and all that. I've told you before. I just said something foolish. He didn't do anything. - No. - No. Go to sleep. - What are you doing? - Just go join the others. Who's that for? Give me ten minutes, and I'll be back. Theo. You're not going to his place. Agnes, step aside. - Hey. Lucas... - What are you doing here? It's just me. What the hell are you doing here? I brought you some food, in case... Are you hungry? Go ahead and eat, if you want. It's very nice. You can just go home, if you like. No... Actually, I'd like to stay for a while. If it's okay. ONE YEAR LATER - Ready? - Yes. - Hi, Johan. - Hello. Hi, Dan. So we're back. Lucas! - Good to see you. - You too. Quiet! Shut up. We're gathered here for a reason. This is the day when boys become men, and men become boys. Marcus, old boy. You have your hunting license. And it's your turn tomorrow at the crack of dawn. You're becoming an adult. You're about to conquer the forest. Come here, my boy. It's a great pleasure to see you here. This is for you. I wish you were my boy, and that this was a present from me. But it's not from me. It's from your father. It's been in your family for generations, and now... it's yours. Take care of it. Your grandfather missed many deer in order to feed your family. Don't forget that. Congratulations! We hope that he will drink with us, and drink with us, and drink with us! We hope that he will drink with us, that he will drink with us! That he will drink with us! Cheers and congratulations! Lunch is served! - Do you have any more? - We'll bring it in. That's tricky. Look at all those lines you can't step on. Yes, I was just thinking the same. - Hi, Klara. - Hi. Are you okay? - How do we get around those lines? - I don't know. There are so many. Yes. Come. Careful now. Very long steps... We made it. I think your dad is in there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You're scaring the deer. - What am I doing? - Did I ruin everything? - No, it'll be back. Marcus. Go wait by your deer stand. You'll wait a while but they'll come. Are you ready? Hope You Enjoyed! :) ..."Pirata-Tuga" TuGAZx...
