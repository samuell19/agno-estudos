IN ASSOCIATION WITH PRESENT THE DISHWASHER Hot! Mushroom! I'm on it. - It's hot! Table 26! - Yeah, yeah. It's coming. Salmon, let's go! - Yes, Chef! Hot. Plating. How long for the focaccia? 30 seconds? Do I have time for a drink? One bruschetta, one olive chicken. - Yes, Chef! What are you doing? Use a cloth. 14! Table 14! - What? Just finished the first seating. Keep it up. It's a good time to go downstairs. - OK. Dammit. If someone had told me I'd ever work in a fancy restaurant, I wouldn't have believed them. The fanciest place I'd ever eaten was St-Hubert BBQ. Actually, if someone had said I'd make anything of my life, I wouldn't have believed them. I moved from Longueuil the year before to study graphic design. I knew Montreal was going to be tough on my wallet. There's something new around every corner: restaurants, bars, record shops, book stores, shows... It was hard to resist. I wasn't super sociable, but I went out a bit. A year and a half later, in the middle of my third term, things went off the rails. At first, you think it's funny to put five dollars in a machine. Then you realize you've spent $200 and it's not even 2 p.m. I couldn't say how many thousands I'd blown. I wasn't going to school. I'd lost three months' rent at empty bars and strip clubs. What you have to understand is that I didn't play to win my money back. I played because I liked the feeling. When the machine lit up and the adrenaline kicked in, nothing could beat it. So no matter how much I won, it didn't change anything. I was going to play again later. It was that simple. I burned my bridges with my good friend Rémi, because I couldn't afford the rent anymore. That asshole! To try to pay him back, I took my first design gig. Alex hooked me up with his metal band, Deathgaze. Freaking nice, man. Good job. - Thanks. Yeah, it looks like the Darkthrone logo. Not bad. It's better than "not bad!" - For real, it's super nice. Darkthrone was the main influence. For the cover, we were thinking about the ocean with a big squid. An octopus. Squid, octopus... Whatever Martin. On top, there'd be a big creature with tentacles, an octopus, and a big logo in the corner. That'd be awesome! Have you talked money? Yeah, how much does he charge? Because I have a friend who'd do it for cheap. You have to pay for talent. How much were you thinking? I don't know... I was thinking $2,000 including the printing and everything. What do you think? Yeah, $2,000 is fine. All right! It's a deal! - All right! $2,000! I'd never gotten so much cash in one shot in my life. It might as well have been a million dollars. We met on November 12th and three weeks later, that $2,000 was gone. I spent three weeks gambling, missing half my classes. By December, I didn't have a penny left. Thank you. Around December 6th, I played my last card: I called my cousin Malik to ask for money. I'm in a jam... I got that, but why? Rémi kicked me out of the apartment. It was nuts: his friends were crashing there every night, they were smoking like crazy, I got fed up. I asked Rémi to pay me back for October and November. He wouldn't, and he said if I wasn't happy, I could get the hell out. Total bullshit, obviously. Are you on the lease? - No. I'm in serious trouble. I don't have a place to go. I'm broke. If you could help me out, that'd be awesome. Hang on. You're broke? I paid for December and January too, and Rémi won't pay me back. Didn't Alex give you money for his album cover? He's only paying me when it's done. After the holidays. Where are you sleeping? - On Vince's couch. Is he charging you rent? - No. And what was the rent at Rémi's? $300? More like $400 with utilities. What's with the interrogation? I don't understand. You worked all summer. You must have made $4,000. - Not quite. You worked 40 hours a week from May to August at $11/hour. After taxes, that's about $4,000. I can believe that Rémi took $1,600 and you spent another couple hundred on beer, but where'd the rest go? Where'd the money go? - I don't know! It just happened. No, it doesn't just happen. Look, I really need some money. Why? You should have plenty in the bank. Why do you need money? I gambled it all away. You gambled it all away? On the machines! I lost it all. Jesus Christ... This is crazy. Who knows? You and Marie-Lou. Fuck! Keep all your receipts, even for a pack of gum. I'm going back to Trois-Rivières, but I'll call. You'd better answer. In the meantime, get your shit together and find a job. You need to keep busy. You'll be all right. Just don't lie to me again, OK? So I started looking for a job. My friend Dave suggested I take over for him at the restaurant he was at. He said it didn't pay much, but it was easy and time passed quickly. That's exactly what I needed: for time to pass quickly. I could go into accounting. I'm good at that stuff. Sarah, there's $36.25 missing from your cash. Really? - Do you know why? Can I help you? - I'm here for my training. What? - I'm here for my training. OK. Next time, come in through the alley. No problem. - Nick, can you bring him to Renaud? Yes. Follow me. He's cute. - He must be the new dishwasher. Renaud. Renaud! - What? There's someone here for you. You're Dave's friend? - Yeah. You have a name? We can't just call you "Dave's Friend." Yeah. - Renaud, we're out of veal stock! We're not. Look harder. - I have! I don't have time. I'm with the new guy. Come on. You can get changed here. The bathrooms are there. You'll need this. There are more shirts in the corner. If you get damp during a shift, change your shirt. It's cold out, but it's hot work, and you don't want to get sick. Christian, can you tell your staff to pick up their crap? This isn't a hockey dressing room. Chef, have you placed that order with Norref? If you want the bisque to be ready for next week, we have to hurry. I'll do it tomorrow. Are you the new dishwasher? - Yeah. Have you done it before? - No. That's OK, it's not complicated. Dave can help you when he gets in. Dave isn't coming tonight, Chef. Who's the other guy? Carl? Eaton? Eaton doesn't work here anymore. Not Eaton, then. The other guy. He's the only one on the schedule. OK, then. Tell Bébert to give him the tour. Let him earn that raise he got. It'll be fine. It's just a restaurant. You're going to be busy on your own. Let's get your mise en place done ASAP. Get changed. Bébert! - Yo! I don't have time for your shit. Dave is supposed to train him. Dave isn't coming in. Christian forgot to book him. Fucking two-bit chef! Can't even make a schedule. What do want me to say? - I don't know. It's not my problem. You're the sous-chef. You do it. Pass me the strainer. OK, relax. I'm keeping Jonathan on tonight. Just train him fast. Jo is on his third double this week. We're gonna get slammed tonight. OK? Yeah, yeah. All right. - Good. You've done this before, I assume? - No, but they said it was easy. It's hard as fuck. I hope you're quicker than your friend Dave. Bébert lost his tooth during a three-day blackout. The second biggest bender of his life. I'd like to know what the biggest was. Saying he was burning the candle at both ends was an understatement. The guy was burning it with a blowtorch at each end. Sort this then remove the stems. Choose ten heads, remove the leaves, wash them, then get the spinner. Do five or six boxes. It sucks to run out when it's busy. OK? - Yeah. Say something, then. OK. - There. This machine can be sneaky. A pastry chef got her hand mangled last year. Young, about your age. Good thing, too, because otherwise, they would've had to amputate. So watch out, because a dishwasher without any hands is good for... ...fuck all! OK, good. Once your mise en place is done, clean your prep room. Wash the counters, mop the floors in here and the cold room. Do it in under 20 minutes, or else your dishes will pile up. Bébert, hurry up. Things are getting busy upstairs. Shut up! I'm doing your job! Fuck it. You'll clean up between the two seatings. Come on. I learned fast that in the kitchen, people don't talk; they bellow. Cut the spinach, goddammit! Bring me some pans! Let's go! - Bonnie, what's up with table 31? The customers hear none of it. Is everything to your taste? Cheers! Welcome to The Trattoria. Bunch of incompetent assholes! Always getting us into shit. That's the sound I heard the most during the week. Even when I wasn't at the restaurant. Lose the rhythm and you're screwed. If it's not clean, check the filters and the soap. Rinse everything before you load it and change the water often. Pull shit out of the dish pit so it doesn't block the drain. That's pretty much it. I'm going back to my crew. You good? - Yeah. Oh yeah! You can play music here. This is like... your kingdom. Your six square feet kingdom. Hurry up. We need saucepans. Want a cigarette? - No, I don't smoke. I hope you drink, though, because the beer's for you. Thanks! - You deserve it. That wasn't bad at all for your first shift. You'll have to speed up, but you look like you know where you're going. What are you doing after? - Who, me? Yes, you! Dummy! - I don't know. We're going out for a drink. Wanna come? I had to go to Vince's apartment right after work. That was one of Malik's conditions. I had to say no. OK. Hey, good job tonight. - Thanks. Are you coming in tomorrow? - I could. I have class, but... All day? - No, just in the morning. Well, if you could come in at 4, that'd be great. I'll be there. - Cool. I'm taking the bus. Don't show up too hungover tomorrow. On the way, I was thinking about the $80 from Malik in my wallet. The rush of the job had made me forget about it. Come on, dishwasher! I kept telling myself, "Please let there be no machines." ... they stopped on the light. - At the light. At the light. They stopped and... Jesus, Bonnie. You've been here for three years! Make an effort! Whistle, Jesus! They whistled at me. "Hey, nice ass!" There he is! What was the total for the night? - $6,200. Damn! So you made some money! - Yeah. Sam! Ten vodkas, and put it on the busboy's tab, please. No, no, no! Screw you. Let's hit up an after party. What's the point of miniature goats on a farm? Shut up! Go to bed! It's late! You get three times less milk... Are you wussing out? - I'm dead. See you tomorrow. See you. I was still a little lucid, and I was proud of myself. I had a job and I hadn't spent all of Malik's money. Just $20. And I hadn't gambled. I often thought about Marie-Lou at the end of a night out. We were together for almost a year. It was one of the best times of my life. And then it just stopped working. Because we were 17, and at 17, you don't know how to be in love. Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. I forgot my notes. No worries. What time is it? - Quarter to one. Did you have class this morning? - No, this afternoon. Big night last night? Not so much. I started a new job as a dishwasher. You? A dishwasher? Does that mean you're going to wash your Kraft dinner pots? Seriously, though, when I get paid, I'll be able to give you some rent. There they are! Don't worry about it. See you later. Hi, Son. We haven't heard from you about Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone's going to be there. I can come get you if you want. Give me a call back. Can't wait to see you. Bye. Hi. I hope you're getting inspired. We can't wait to see it. I sent you the lyrics you asked for. Mike wants to know how it's going. At least the logo. Talk to you soon. It's Rémi. I'm getting tired of chasing after you for my money. Call me back. Fuck this. Hi, it's Malik. I'm just calling to see how it's going. Call me back. Hello. - Hey. What'll you have? - A pint of red, please. Here you go. - Thanks. Hey Christian, I'm so sorry. My class went late... Take a deep breath. No one gets here on time. Get dressed and go help Carl. Oh shit, the dishwasher! I thought you were gonna flake. My class went late. Right. You were just hungover. Bonnie's not here tonight? Why are you asking? Just curious. Forget about it. She's not for you. And you have to get in line! It's about time! I'm Carl. I have to make a call. You good? Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. My cutlery, goddammit! Where's your partner? I asked him 20 minutes ago. Do I need to smack him? Hey, I'm talking to you! I had just met Greg. From that moment on, one thing was certain: I would do what it took to stay on his good side. It's here. I'll put it in the machine. Give me two minutes. Fucking useless skater. Keep it up! Here you go. All right! You're a warrior! Not like that slacker. I'm coming, you animals! Cool, you did that quick. That means I can go. He doesn't do shit, huh? Who? - Don't give me that. Next time he pulls that crap, put your foot down, OK? Carl is a jerk. Don't let him get away with it. Hi Stéphane, it's Malik. This is the second message I'm leaving you. I don't know what's up, but turn your ringer on, please. OK, bye. Malik. I'd forgotten. You were supposed to call me back. - I know. Work was crazy. I'm sorry. Is it going well, at least? - Yeah, it's a good crew. Cool. I just booked a trip to Cuba with my girlfriend for the holidays. It'll be good for us. You going to your parents' on the 24th? Yeah, I should. It wasn't a question. You're going. Yeah, I'll go. - Good. I'll be able to give you your $80. I've even started paying Rémi back. Good. And your classes? - I'll survive. The job is helping me think more clearly. I'm glad to hear it. Give me a call by the end of the week. Yes, will do. I'm happy you're doing better. Yeah, don't worry. Things are settling down. Bye! OK, bye. As soon as I hung up, the stress and anxiety came right back. I thought about Rémi, the Deathgaze guys... and Marie-Lou. I wanted to see Marie-Lou. When she heard I was in a jam with Rémi, Marie-Lou helped me out. She lent me money and made me promise not to gamble again. I gambled four days later. It's fine. - Just fine? The people are cool, but it's still dishwashing. It's like working at the dump when the trucks bring the garbage. It's not the most fun. Jesus, Steph. You're 19. Did you expect to be CEO at 19? I know, but it's boring. At least you're comfortable here. Your clothes don't smell like trash and you can talk to nice men. Are you hiring? You think it's a good idea to work in a place with machines? I was just joking. - Very funny. How's the Deathgaze stuff going? - I'm almost done. Are you happy with it? - Yeah, I really am. I think it's some of my best work. I can't wait to show you. I'm excited! Your first big gig! What about you? I want to get away. I might travel for a while. Everyone's going away. That's fun. Huh? - Malik's going to Cuba. I was thinking BC or South America. I'm not sure yet. Steph! - Hm? Sorry! For Christ's sake. - I was listening. You said you wanted to go to BC or South America. Yeah. I'm saving up and I'll see where I can go. I'll be able to pay you back soon. I'm getting a lot of shifts. What about school? - I'm working around it. How's it going, man? - Good, you? So, you're at The Trattoria? - News travels fast. Is Greg still there? - You know Greg? Yeah, I knew him in a past life. I have work. I should go. Come by again soon. Bye. - Bye. Take care. Don't worry. No fucking way. At least a seven if I have to travel. I don't care! Seven! Carl! It's nuts today and I don't want to repeat myself. I need forks! Here. This should do for a while. - Warrior. You and I, we're connected. The manager doesn't fool around with the cutlery! What manager? - Greg. Greg's not a manager, he's a busboy. Good thing, too! Bébert's rap compilation. Don't you like metal? It's quiet tonight. You can get by without me. Did you do your mise en place? - Yeah, it's done. If it's OK with your partner, you can go. Is it OK? All right, go. Bébert? - Yo! Is it normal for the water to be cold? What? - The water's cold. Shit! So? The fuse is dead. Party's over. No, tomorrow doesn't work. The restaurant is open now. No, forget it. Hello! I need a repairman now. Shit. It's an emergency! What do you mean, no one's free? What are you doing? Even though it didn't make sense, I held Carl responsible for the fuckup with the water heater. Every time I dunked something in the boiling water, I imagined it was Carl's head. We're out of spinach! I'm on it. Shit! Fucking Carl! Is everything to your taste? Cheers! Welcome to The Trattoria! I'm hurrying. He didn't do his mise en place. What's up with the spinach? There are 10 tables on standby. Do I need a repairman for that, too? Bonnie, I'm talking to you! It's Christian! He hires dipshits who can't even do a mise en place! Who asked you? Flip your pan or I'll come do it for you. Yes, ma'am. Bébert? Is the ossobuco ready? - Get me a beer, Sarah. I can't- - A beer! The ossobuco's coming. Renaud is finishing it off. All right! A warrior who listens to good music! I saw them in '95 at the Verdun Auditorium. We were moshing so hard, people left in an ambulance. Are you coming out with us tonight? We should talk. Yeah, I'm in. Greg made you feel special when you were near him. He looked like a prince or a godfather. Definitely not a busboy. Tell your friend to leave the door unlocked. If it goes well, he gets 10%. If not, he can eat shit. Thanks. You can talk to me in French. Thanks. What do you listen to aside from Maiden? Oh, lots of stuff. You like Slayer, too? ...but I'm a hippie inside. I listen to metal because of by big sis. When I feel like a hippie, I listen to Neil Young. And I think Janis Joplin's voice is more intense than any metal guitar solo. But my favourite singer is Bruce Dickinson. He's my idol. I like his experimentation on Chemical Wedding. Roy Z replaced the sixth strings on their guitars with bass strings to make the sound heavier, and Bruce is such a good lyricist. The lyrics on Chemical Wedding are nuts. He was inspired by William Blake. Do you know who that is? I was usually a quiet guy, but I couldn't stop that night. I told her about every song. She listened, probably to be polite. I finally heard my overenthusiasm. I had the feeling I was losing her. So, why'd you come to Montreal? One for you, one for me, and one for you. Cheers, boys. Is Greg really a busboy? He seems too old. Why do you care? - I don't know. It doesn't seem to fit. He's what, 30? 35? What do you want to know? - Nothing. I just find it weird. I thought he was our boss. Two bits of advice: first, if you have questions about Greg, ask him, not anyone else. Second, avoid asking him questions. He hates that. You need another drink. Cheers, boys! - Happy birthday! It's Chris! What are you doing Sunday? - I don't know. I don't have plans. Me and some guys are having a LARP battle. I thought you might want to join us. I've seen the books you read, and you seem interested in fantasy and history... I started to feel uncomfortable. I was hot. I told myself I should have left with Bonnie. It was only 1:15. I was dreading being alone outside. I wasn't too far from Marie-Lou's bar. Maybe she hadn't finished her shift. Hey, you came to see us! Yeah. Is Marie-Lou here? No, I sent her home. As you can see, it's pretty quiet. What are you reading? It's an old book from the 20s. The movie's coming out next week. Scorsese is directing. Cool. I love Scorsese. Hey, man! How's it going? - Not bad. You guys seem good. You bet! We'll take eight pickle vodkas! Yes, sir. A shiver went up from my ankles all the way to my neck. I started with a 20 and my winnings slowly went up to $70. There was a night bus in 20 minutes. I wanted to get up to $100. I ended up losing track of time. I don't know if I was there for three minutes or three hours. I felt euphoric. My heart was pumping lava. My eyes melted into their sockets like two burning marbles that could only see the lucky sequences that- Jesus Christ! What are you doing here? You're gambling in my face, at my work, with my money? I just had a little relapse. - No, stop. There's no use. I was there for you, like an idiot. Just leave me alone. - Marie... Keep the money. I don't care. - Marie, please. You make that pitiful face at me and I believe you. It's so pathetic. Shit! ...my Colour prof. I didn't think I'd like the course, but I love it. The school is great. Everyone is really nice and open-minded. And I got my first gig... Almost. Just raise your finger... Yes. And the other one down. Yeah. Hi Marie, it's me. I'm at my parents' for a couple days. I'm getting back on track. Call me back, please. Merry Christmas. You OK, son? Yeah, I was just calling Marie-Lou to wish her a merry Christmas. How's she doing? - Good. She's working at a bar. Follow me. I have something for you. This was lying around at Grandpa's and I thought it would interest you. For sure! Thanks! Azimov covers are always great. The ones Caza did are beautiful. So... you've been hiding things from us? Huh? - We spoke to Malik. You got your first design job! - Oh, yeah. Congratulations! You should've told us! It's not a big job... - Still! You have to start somewhere. It's tough to live off your passion. Every little job is a victory. Anyway, we just wanted to say... that your mother and I are very proud of you. Thanks, Dad. That's nice. Here. Huh? You didn't have to do that. I added a little extra. Don't tell your mother. I have a job. But with school, you must not have time for many shifts. It'll pay for some rent at Rémi's. I'm getting by, Dad. - Hey, it's our pleasure. OK. Thanks. Merry Christmas, son. Merry Christmas, Dad. The holidays suck. You're not spending New Year's with family, then? I'd have to go to prison to do that. What are you doing? Don't throw that out. What do you think we make the seafood sauce with? Oh, sorry. You keep everything. Vegetable scraps go into broth, peppers go into pesto and coulis... OK. - Come here. Taste this. Shit, that's good! - It's Christian's recipe. Christian? - Yeah. You keep saying he's useless. - No, he's just sad. I knew him when he was a sous-chef. He was a beast of a cook. But since his daughter died of leukemia, he's been in free fall. His wife dumped him last winter. Now he's just... a ghost. What he needs is a long break. Sometimes work is all you've got. I have presents for you! - Thanks! Don't drink it all tonight! - It's mine. I'll do what I want. While you're coming in your pants, I'll help you finish up. We've got a big group tonight and we're going to be slammed. You almost done? - Yeah, two seconds. Stuff is piling up. Yo! Yeah... We need more lettuce! - Frisée and romaine! Bébert, I'm not doing all the work while that guy jerks off downstairs. Shut up! I'm not doing two people's jobs because the new guy can't keep up. Go help him instead of complaining! What the hell are you- - You think I'm jerking off? Does this look like jerking off to you? Let go of me! - Shut up! Shut up, asshole! Don't ever say I'm slacking again. You got that? Let go! - Shut up! You got it, asshole? You don't know who I am! You're fucking dead! Shut up! You're nobody, so get the hell out! Jesus! You OK? Where'd that come from? You're tough, warrior. Guess what! The new guy just kicked the shit out of the slacker! You OK, man? - Yeah, I'm all right. Get out of your head. He was shit. We don't need people like him here. Yeah... See you soon. We don't have many reservations tomorrow. You had a big night, so take the day off. We'll do the dishwashing. - You sure? Yeah. Make the most of it. I'll take another, please. Hey, man. We wanted to know when you'd show us some sketches. Mike is stressing out, especially given that you bailed last time. I defended you, but I need some news, because I'm starting to look like an idiot. Come by the rehearsal space this week, OK? Happy holidays! I decided to tell Christian that I was available 24/7. But Christian was fired when he got back from the break. During the last six months, Christian had been stealing liquor. He'd show up drunk in the morning. Someone on the staff told Séverine. She had no choice but to act. So I asked Renaud, the new chef, if I could have more shifts. I did my job more confidently, without worrying about anyone else. It was great not to have time to think about my own crap. I wasn't sure I was in the right place, but it was better than being in front of a machine in a dingy bar. You coming out after? - For sure. I'm going out for a smoke. - What? You don't even smoke! I'll be back. Can I help you? - I'm here to see Stéphane. There's no Stéphane here. I'm pretty sure there is. How can I say this... There's no Stéphane here. OK. Thanks. Who was that? A friend. I slept with his girlfriend. OK, this is it: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Drop that shit! Come on! They're so drunk, they didn't even notice I took a bottle! Have you ever done this? - With a knife? No. It's easy. Find the right line, rub it a bit, then one quick motion. First shot! - It did it on its own! Keep going! There you go! It's overflowing. - It's just head. OK, put that down. There. Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! You're a good guy. I hope you have a fucking great year. Thanks. I want to say... I'm really happy I got a job here. It's not bad. And... I'm happy to have found a friend. A friend? You'll make friends in this business. But you won't keep them long. Enjoy it while you can, because people change jobs fast. Happy New Year! Seriously, man. I don't know where you're hiding, but this sucks. At this point, maybe you should just give us back our money. Happy New Year. Yo, can you do the place settings real quick? I'll do it right after this. - I'm supposed to meet my friends... Your friends can wait 10 minutes. I'll do it after this. All right, relax. Yeah, give me 10-15 minutes. Yeah, a pint of 50. Fucking Kovac! I've got a bullet just for him. If he even sets foot on my porch, I'll shoot him right in the head. I'm sick of unreliable people. Even he would do a better job! Hey, warrior! Are you reliable? - Yeah, yeah. Do you have any time outside your shifts? Yeah, I could- - No, I just saw your schedule. You're pulling 80-hour weeks. Forget it. You're already close to burning out. You need downtime. Bert, I think the kid can speak for himself. Dishwashing doesn't pay much. I've been looking for a better-paying sideline. Good. I know all about sidelines. We'll move you up to the kitchen instead. That'll be better for your health. About fucking time! Listen, Greg seems great, but he's not one of the good guys. Don't get into a situation where you owe him anything. This isn't for you. - What do you know? I can tell just from looking at you. You do lots of stuff with Greg. - That's me, OK? Don't look at me as a model. Back off. You're smarter than that. I'll have a pint of red, please. How's it feel to drink on my dime? Hang on. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. It's like a late Christmas present. Let go of me. I thought that when I saw you, I'd kick your ass... But I don't feel like it now. Look how pathetic you are. Rémi, please. - Shut up. You see that ATM? You're going to get my money and give it to me. I don't have your money. - Take out what you can, then. I'll pay you back, Rémi... - Let go of him. What's going on here? You know these guys? No. They say I stole their beer. Are you saying my friend is a thief? Huh? Is that what you're saying? Do I look like a guy who can't afford to buy his friend a beer? We look like bums, is that it? Hey! I asked you a question! Do we look like fucking bums? Shut up! Answer me. Shut up! Do we look like fucking bums? My friend didn't steal your beer. He doesn't care about your beer. We don't want trouble. We'll go. That's a very good idea. I'll buy you a beer. Next time, come get us. Hello. - Hello. Baccarat is an easy game. It's a bit like war. The croupier deals cards to the player, then to the banker. You can bet on the player, the banker or on a tie. By doubling your bet each time, you can win a pile fast. Face cards are worth nothing. So eight for the player, four for the banker. I just doubled my money. A queen for us: zero. A seven for the banker: seven. A six for us: six. An eight for the banker: 15. Actually, five. You don't count the tens in baccarat. It's weird. The house had five, not 15. I thought I'd finally won. But the croupier could turn over a third card: a seven. Five plus seven equals 12, so two. The player side wins. I didn't know then, but the chances of a tie are low. Less than 10%. A king for us: nothing. A six for the bank: six. An ace for us: one. A four for the bank: 10, so zero. A nine for us: zero. A queen for the bank: zero. A tie. Good job, kid! How much does a tie pay? - Eight times your bet, sir. I took that as a sign. I'm out. Have a good night. - You, too. I counted my chips. I had $2,300. I counted twice just to be sure. With what was in my bank account, I had enough to pay to print the Deathgaze cover. And with my next paycheque, I'd even have enough to pay Marie-Lou back. And I could give Rémi a couple months' rent. But at that point, fuck Rémi. As my stack went down, I felt cut off from the world. I couldn't have left the table to help my dying mother. All my senses were numb. I was held in place by the feeling of billions of needles up my spine. There were the bets, my hand, and the green felt. There was the silent spinning of the cosmos, the stardust of chance, and time folding in on itself. Endlessly. 23 red. Sorry, I'll come back. - No, it's all right. You OK? Yeah. You disappeared yesterday. Bébert and I were looking for you. Yeah, I had a headache. I know a couple guys with headaches today. The guys who said you stole their beer. My friends caught up with them in the alley. Oh yeah? What'd they do? They just scared them a bit. I mean, are they OK? What do you care? You don't know those guys. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just working. I don't know what to tell you, Bonnie. I was tired. You were with a dude. I didn't want to bother you. I was with a dude? I don't care. I just left. It's not the end of the world. No. Do what you want. It's none of my business. Well, you seem pretty close to your friends. I'm busy. I don't have time for this. You're not the first and you won't be the last. Can you send someone to his house? - I don't think he's home. Renaud, can you stay until he shows up? It's not the first time he's been late. He'll be here. There are barely any reservations. You know that means nothing. Séverine isn't coming in tonight and if Bébert doesn't show up, we have no one on hot. This is my only night off. I haven't had one in two months. I can call Séverine to tell her that you're leaving us in a jam. You want to go there, Sarah? I can tell her about your glasses of wine that you don't punch in. You'll get by, kids. No stress. I'll find Bébert. Shit! Smile. He's here. Apparently, not long after I left the bar, the party started. Bébert and his gang drank three pitchers, then took some speed so they wouldn't crash. Nelly, Bébert's ex, showed up and started messing with his head. They drank all night, then Bébert disappeared with Nelly. He told me he ended up with glass in his foot somehow. Stop! What are you doing? You fucking maniac! Fuck! Hey. Go get me a case of Heineken. If they don't have that, Blue. I'll take an Instant Fortune. Thanks. Two more. I said Heineken or Blue, not this fucking cat piss. You didn't give me enough cash. - Whatever... Get out of here. I'm back. Is it ready? It's taking a fucking long time... OK, let's move! Four, 10 and 15 don't have their apps. And six has been waiting a half hour for pasta. Here's your damn pasta. Can you flip a pan or did Renaud move you up here because you suck good cock? Bad night with Sam? Is that why you're in a mood? Does he know you go after colleagues when he doesn't call? You can be mad, but... I'm helping you. Get the hell out of here! What's going on? Where are the tongs? They can all eat carbs! OK, that's enough! We're closing the fucking kitchen! That night made me think differently about the previous weeks. Compared to Bébert, I hadn't hit rock bottom. I could still do something to make up for it all, but I had to act fast; I had to find money. My mom wants me to go into medicine. I'm thinking psychology. So, warrior? Not too tired? - I'm all right. Sarah, a pint and two shots, please. Hell of a night. Does Bébert do that often? We all blow a fuse from time to time. This isn't an easy job. No sane person does it. Here you go, boys. Enjoy. - Thanks. You know what you said about that high-paying sideline? You need a sideline? - Yeah. I might have something. But I'm warning you: this isn't a one-time deal. You can't fuck off after a week. I need someone solid. I really need money. I'll do anything. I just have to make sure I can trust you first. No problem, Greg. This week, one of my guys is running an errand for me. I need someone to back him up. What kind of errand? - An errand. Don't worry. No one should have a piece on them. You're going to join Will. - Who? Will. You just have to stay with him during the errand. It's like if your friend needed to take a dump and wanted you to keep him company in the public bathroom. The errand is in a bathroom? - No! Stop being dumb and listen. - Yeah. My guy and his driver will be at Assomption metro. They'll be parked by the bus stop in a blue Civic at five o'clock. Once you're with them, don't let them out of your sight. Got it? - Got it. You're Greg's new friend? - Yeah. I don't know what he told you, but you listen to me now. Yeah, OK. If you see him before I do, tell him I don't need a chaperone. OK. - Get in already. Other side. When it's done, come see me and I'll give you your cut. If it goes well, we'll talk about other stuff. Go wait for us out back. - No worries. Don't fuck this up, OK? It's me. Hurry up. You stay there. Come on, we're outta here. You did good. - Thanks. What's your name? - Stéphane. I was terrified to tell Greg. But it was going to be worse if I waited. Yeah. They got you good. - I don't know what happened, Greg. They came out of nowhere. I didn't see- Warrior, relax. You had a big night. Breathe. You're not gonna ask what happened? Why would I? Did you do what I asked? Yeah. - That's what matters. Did Will tell you everything? Do I look like I don't know what happens on my jobs? It's in the past. You showed me I can trust you. Give me a couple days. I'll have something for you. Good job, warrior. Cool. Thanks, Greg. Don't worry about it. Shit happens. Sorry about the other night. It's all right. It happens. It's not supposed to. Now it's your turn to apologize. - What for? I asked you not to play gangster and you did it anyway. You almost ended up like him. - We just got maced and beat up. Do you hear yourself? "We just got maced and beat up." "Everything's fine!" You dumbass. You had $4,000, some guys jump you and they just stop there? I know guys who got stabbed for $50. They robbed you without any guns. Maybe they weren't that organized. Maybe they took a chance. You really don't know how this stuff works. No one in this neighbourhood would dare steal from Greg, OK? Except maybe one of his own guys. It was Will's friends! - Of course it was! Will set up the whole thing. Greg hadn't trusted him for a while. You just happened to be there when he decided to make his move. I don't know what possessed him to have Greg shot, though. It's not going to end there. Do me a favour, OK? Stay away from all this stuff. I never heard if Greg got out of the hospital. If he did, he never came back to The Trattoria. What happened to Will was clearer. Let's just say, it didn't end well. Hey. Aw shit. Hey, man. Did I wake you? No. I have a big exam in two days. I've been studying like crazy. What happened? - I fell off my bike. You don't bike. - There's a delivery bike at work. OK. Nice dismount. Yeah. Big dismount. It's good to see you. We haven't crossed paths in a while. You OK, man? Yeah. We can't give each other a little love? We're closed! Hey! Come in. - I won't stay long. Nice shiner. - Yeah, I fell on the ice. Is Marie-Lou coming in soon? Marie-Lou won't be in for a while. She's in BC. You didn't know? She left a few days ago. No. For how long? - Unclear. A couple months. You OK? - Yeah, yeah. Thanks. No, sit down. Want a beer? - Sure, why not. Are the rumours true? Did Greg get shot at The Trattoria? Yeah, it's true. - Damn. It's rough on the Plateau. Thanks. How did you meet Greg? I used to work in restaurants. I met him in the kitchen. He was my dealer. - Your dealer? I worked in a restaurant with a fascist chef who tossed our food in the sink if he wasn't happy, and he was never happy. I had eczema all over, my partners would throw up before their shifts. I couldn't eat anything but apples. The rest wouldn't stay down. Shit. I'd go through five bags of Granny Smiths a week. 16-hour shifts, no breaks, just two minutes for a smoke. We were slammed every night. No room for error. Whoa. What was the restaurant? A big restaurant. Fancy as hell. Bono came to eat at the bar. - Seriously? Bono? Yeah, man. Bono. It's hard not to get coked up. There's nothing like a couple lines to get you going the next day. Especially if you drank after your shift. Eventually, I lost my girlfriend, 32 pounds and a bunch of friends. Then, I crashed. I stopped everything for two years. Now I work on my own terms, with people I respect and who respect me. And you stopped doing coke? You never really stop. Even when you think you have, you haven't. You just take breaks. At my worst, I'd spend all night going back and forth between Greg's place and my apartment. I'd buy a quarter, telling myself it'd be the last time. But I just kept on going... until my last $20. A bullet in his lung doesn't sound good. Greg's tough. He'll make it. - But the restaurant won't. What do you mean? - Look! You see any people? It's a weekday. It's always quiet. - Not quiet. It's literally dead. People freak out when there's a tiny health code violation. A guy gets shot here? Forget about it. This isn't Compton, this is the Plateau. Steph, come to my office. - OK. Close the door, please. I just wanted to tell you that Bébert won't be back. Huh? Why? Do I have to explain? You were there. It was just one time. - Just one time. That's funny. Bébert works his ass off. He does it all. Yeah, but we can't tolerate that kind of behaviour. That's it. This isn't a tavern. Bonnie told me you really stepped up. I'd like to bring you up to the kitchen. What do you think? I'm not sure. Unless you want to find a better paying job elsewhere. I wanted to tell him to shove the job up his ass, but I still owed over $3,000 and I only had $100 in my pockets. Bébert was my friend, my mentor, and I'd just lost him. All I had left was my shitty life, my lies and not many people. Where are you going? - What are you doing here? Are you following me? - It looks like I need to. What are you doing? - What are YOU doing? Your parents are worried. They can't reach you. You don't return calls? I was going to call. - There was a shooting at your job? Whatever... Rémi got in touch with me. You owe him a lot of money! More than a couple months' rent! Did you know he got beat up by those guys you were with? No one beat him up. - His arm is in a cast! Look at your face! What are you into, Steph? Nothing. I fell on some ice. - Stop jerking me around, OK? I've had enough of your lies. What about the promises you made me? Was that all bullshit? Who are your shitty friends? - Guys from work. They don't screen people there? They hire any kind of crook? Calm down. - No, I won't! Screw you! The cash I lent you, the cash you made at work... Did you gamble it all away? - No, I don't gamble anymore. You were about to go into a bar. You can't lie to me anymore. You're busted, goddammit! I don't know what's going on. I don't understand. I can't stop gambling. I'm trying, but I can't. I just can't. You just need help. Do you understand? I'm here, OK? Look. You're coming home with me, and it's going to be all right. Though I missed the adrenaline, I haven't set foot in a restaurant kitchen since. I finished CEGEP, then went to UQAM to continue my design studies. Montreal is small, but I haven't run into anyone from The Trattoria. Well, almost no one. Holy shit! - No way! It's great to see you! You look good! Yeah, I'm good. What are you doing around here? I'm crashing at my friend Doug's. I don't know him. - Good thing, too. Where are you working? - I'm not working... anymore. They let me go in the fall. I knew it was coming. But I still have two months of benefits. How do you like the hood? If you like hookers and heroin, it's not bad. There aren't needles anymore. They're cleaning the area up. I was in a crack house just yesterday! Why were you at a crack house? No reason. I was with a guy. Why don't we grab a beer? - I'm meeting my girlfriend. Oh shit, your girlfriend! - Yeah. Say you bumped into an old friend. - OK. How are your comics going? Slowly. I have a lot of illustration work. Oh yeah? What for? Flyers, programs, sometimes novels. I just got a copy of the latest one. Oh shit! That's cool! You're in the big leagues, now! That's why you're all clean cut! Next to you, everyone looks clean! Congrats, man! I knew you'd get straightened out. Life rewards reliability like yours. Thanks, man. Here. A present. Do I have to read it? Come on. - Who's that? Do me a favour. Pretend you're playing. Go on, play! You hiding from us? Have you ever seen me hide? Who's he? What's he doing here? You brought a little bodyguard? I'll come see you after. You can see I'm with my friend. OK. We'll wait while you finish up. But do it quick. You've jerked us around enough. Jesus! You could've warned me. - Forget it! It's not important. Aren't those Greg's friends? - It's good to see you again! I should write a book someday. About me and my shitty stories. I'm sure people would read it. - No way. I don't want to hold you up. Go see your girlfriend. Yeah, I think I should go. Can you sign the book? - For sure. Here's my phone number, too. We should catch up some time. - Definitely! It was great to see you. - You, too. Take care. - Always. Where are we going tonight, ladies? Shut up and walk. - OK.
