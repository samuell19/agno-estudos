No, please. Please. They didn't tell me an audience was coming, so that changes quite a bit. But anyway, thank you so much for coming to this... to this nonsense. I am Ted L. Nancy. And I appreciate it. And I'd like to tell you a little bit about how all this started, how I got into writing these letters and getting these responses, kind of an interesting story. So let me just make my way out here now. Walking, dead man walking. And... now I am here. Uh, true story. Like, I said, kind of interesting, it was about 20 years ago and I'm sitting in my room, it's about four o'clock in the morning. And I was sitting in my room with my lady friend Phyllis. And she was watching TV, kind of half listening to me, and I was sitting in another chair, mindlessly eating a bag of Fritos, you know how you kinda just shovel snacks in and stuff like that? I shouldn't be eating Fritos then and I shouldn't be eating Fritos now because I've had a weight problem my whole life and it's-- I cannot lose any weight. And I think I've built myself into the body of a small pot roast is what... There's... Terrible dieter. Constant yo-yo dieting. I just went on one diet. I had to go on two diets at the same time 'cause one diet wasn't giving me enough food. Listen, I know I'm not a Chippendale dancer. Those days are over. More like a Chip Ahoy dancer. Easy, easy now. Uh, terrible exerciser. I spent two hours at the gym this morning, I finally found parking. That gym is called Dead Man Working Out. My idea of a good workout is I like to strap myself onto another person while they're exercising. Anyway, so I'm eating these Fritos and I notice on the side of the bag of the Fritos, you know, they have like a little message. It said, "You got any problems? Any issues? Write Fritos with your issues We wanna hear from you." Who needs to write Fritos? You know, you got issues? Go to a therapist. You know? You don't wanna unload on a corn chip company with... with your problems, you know. And Phyllis is going, "Uh-huh. Yeah." Kind of half listening. And I go, "What would you say to Fritos?" I'm talking out loud. I go, "Would you act like you're a moron and you don't understand what a Frito is?" You can't understand the concept of what they're-- "I have no idea what you're doing here. What is this?" And you explain the product. "I opened your product, this Frito thing that you have, and they were all stale and they were crunchy and they were hard and I got orange dust all over me and I had to throw the whole... I had... I had to throw the whole thing away. It was stale." And I said, "Who would write Fritos?" And Phyllis goes, "A nut, that's who would write Fritos." Then the next day I'm in the 99 cent store buying some Bon Ami cleanser. Because I only like cleanser from 1920. And I see the same kind of message. It says, "You got any problems? Any issues? Write Bon Ami. We wanna hear from you." And it's stamped Gordon Brukar the V. But I'm looking at the stamp and it could be-- it was smudgy. It could be Brukar the IV. I'm studying the stamp, you know? And maybe that's Gordon Brukar the III. And I'm building this whole fantasy of Gordon Brukar in my head, is there five Gordon Brukars? They're selling cleanser? Is there one Gordon Brukar? Have I stumbled on a Gordon Brukar nest? What is going on here? What would I say to him? I wanna write to this man. I wanna get into Gordon Brukar's life. Would I tell him my Fritos issues? What would I say to him? Then I started noticing it, like, calling to me, like, you know, all these companies wanted you to write to them and they wanted you to reach out and answer them. I get my gas bill. And the gas bill says, "Hey, you got any problems? You wanna write to us? Tell us what you think of our gas pamphlets." And I go,"Well, you know, I collect the gas pamphlets and I'm missing the complete set from 1988. With all of your gas all-stars." So I thought, you know what? I'm gonna write to these people 'cause they wanna hear from me. And why not? I've got 23 hours a day to kill. Why not write to these people? They wanna hear from me. That's the sick thing I had going in my head, that they wanted to hear from me. Nobody really wants to hear from me. So with your kind indulgence, I would like to now read to you Letters From a Nut. Did he mention these were real? So here's one I wrote to a deodorant company. I think you'll enjoy it. Started it off with, "Ted L. Nancy. 560 North Moorpark Road. Apartment 236. Thousand Oaks, California. 91360. Dear Degree Deodorant. I have been using your product for some time. My underarms are finally back to normal. All paperwork is complete. I have used your deodorant for everyday functions, as well as special events, like at a buffet. On your deodorant it says, "Keeps your underarms cool and dry.' And then I bought a package of Parmesan cheese, and it says, 'Store in a cool, dry place.' What gives? Should I store my Parmesan cheese under my arms? Would it be safe to spray deodorant on my cheese? What can I eat? Hungry. Send me a picture of your deodorant for my wall. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Mr. Nancy. It was thoughtful of you to let us hear your comments about Degree. Comments such as yours are certainly gratifying, and most welcome. As a token of our appreciation, I am enclosing a coupon for your use. Sincerely, Degree Deodorant consumer representative." "Dear Akron Summa City Hospital, I have a problem. I was in a coma for five years... and when I woke up, I found out my wife had left me for another man in a coma. I need my records. My doctor's name is Dr. Jhabardi Del Fudgio. I think he is Ghananese. He has a freckle. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Mr. Nancy, we have no patient treated with the name Ted L. Nancy. Nor do we have a Dr. Del Fudgio. Perhaps you have the wrong facility. Respectfully, Akron Summa City Hospital." "Dear Nordstrom's department store, I am a regular shopper at your store in Glendale. In the last few weeks, I have noticed that a new mannequin you have out in the store looks just like my deceased neighbor. I have passed this mannequin from many directions and the resemblance is uncanny: nose, cheekbones, hair, even down to the windbreaker jacket my neighbor would wear. Is it possible to buy... is it possible to buy this mannequin so I may present it to my neighbor's family... to help with the grieving? I think having him there would be good therapeutic behavior for all. This family is in need of some good loving. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Mr. Nancy, yours is one of the most interesting requests I have ever received. Candidly, I can't imagine any family who has lost a loved one wanting to see a mannequin that resembles that person. Of course, we want to respond to our customers as positively as possible, so I see no reason why, when it comes time for a change of mannequins, that we wouldn't sell it to you at the same price we would get from our normal resources. Simply talk to our store manager there at Glendale and she will let you know when the time comes. Sincerely, Bruce A. Nordstrom. Reginald Perse, corporate display manager." Reginald Perse. Nordstrom's immediately followed with a second letter. - They were on this. - Dear Mr. Nancy, your letter was forwarded to me by Mr. Bruce Nordstrom and I am aware of your request for a particular mannequin resembling a deceased friend. After reading your letter, I was somewhat perplexed as to which mannequin you were talking about, as our store does not use male mannequins in our display area. I would be more than happy to work with you once we are able to isolate which mannequin this could be. Sincerely, Store Manager. Reginald Perse, corporate display manager." - Reginald Perse. - Oh, my God! Dear Nordstrom's, thank you for your help. However, there's been a new development. We were hoping to buy your mannequin so my neighbor could take it to the Olive Garden and maybe Six Flags Magic Mountain and go on some rides... to help with the grieving. This family needs this. However, on another visit to your store, my neighbor had her eye on a different mannequin in the camping department. This is a younger mannequin, better built, taller, no windbreaker, muscle shirt. I named it Carlo for her." Carlo. "Personally, I think it's too young for her. But to help with the grieving, I ask you..." "How much is that mannequin in the window? For the widow woman? Let's get her back to a solid relationship. Ted L. Nancy." No, I don't... You know, I love traveling this world. I consider myself an international nothing. A nobody here, a nobody there. But the only place I'll ever eat at is the International House of Pancakes, which is now officially a chain of filthy restaurants. Try the one in Burbank, I was there about four or five weeks ago in Burbank at the Pancake House, took a look at the menu, there were pictures of flies on the pictures of the food. I don't mind a little grease on the table, but I think it's disgusting while you're eating a fly lands on your table, slips and breaks his leg. So I wrote to the Netherlands, being the international nothing that I am, and I wrote, "Dear Reservations, I am staging my play in Amsterdam and need to know what health permits I need to stay at your hotel for 12 nights. My play is called Hamsterdam. It involves a telling of the history of your city using 300 hamsters. All hamsters have been inoculated for hamster diseases. I keep them contained in special hamster bins which have been cleared by local U.S. health peoples. I believe his name is Andy. Do you have cricket vending machines as I have heard? Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." "Amstel Hotel, The Netherlands. Dear Ted, unfortunately the hamsters are not allowed in our hotel. The Amstel Hotel can not accommodate 300 little hamsters in a room. Please be assured that we hope that your show will be a great event, but we can not reserve a room for the hamsters. No hamster! With kind regards..., reservations trainee." Dear Hotel Amstel, thank you very kindly for getting back to me. In this day and age, it is so nice to deal with a hotel as professional and dignified as yours. Larry! Sorry, I bark out men's names when agitated. It is a disease I am controlling with Canadian medications. Hector! Now, I understand your concern about keeping 300 hamsters in my room. It is wrong. I now realize it is a disease issue. That is why I have decided to re-stage my Hamsterdamplay. It is now called Amsterclam. I need to bring 500 clams into your hotel and have them live in the room with me. Clams are not like filthy hamsters. They are wet. Please alert housekeeping so when they open the door they can spray. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." No further reply. Ribbit. Here's a letter I think you may enjoy. It was to Ralphs supermarket, which is my favorite supermarket. "Dear favorite supermarket I shop at, I recently bought a sponge from you. I was in my kitchen and I put my sponge on the kitchen sink. The next morning, when I woke up, that sponge was in the bedroom with me. How did it get there? I took that sponge and locked it in a room. All night I heard banging. That sponge wanted to get out. But I wouldn't let it. I want to talk to somebody there about the possibility that my sponge is haunted. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." Dear Mr. Nancy, we were sorry to hear that you're less than satisfied with the performance of this product. We've had no reports of similar situations. We forwarded your letter to our supplier, asking that they follow up with you. Respectfully yours, your favorite supermarket." Dear favorite supermarket, you said I would be hearing from the supplier of this sponge. I have not heard from them. And this sponge is bad. After I got your letter, I went down to my basement and locked this sponge in a steel box, and put a chain around that box. Then I boarded up the door with over a thousand nails. Then I put a manacle on that door. Then I went upstairs to my room to get a good night's sleep. At about three o'clock in the morning, I woke up. That sponge was right by my bed. I am scared. Also, do you sell Brillo at your store? Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." Thought I had a pretty good idea for a business. You know, sometimes you go, you know what? This one's a winner. I've had quite a few losers, but this one's gonna take off, I feel it. So I needed a sign made so I wrote to, "Dear Banners and Signs For Less, I am opening a business next to a Koo Koo Koo-Roo restaurant. My business is called I Am The Walrus. I need a sign which I will put next to them, so I will have one big sign that says, "I am the walrus, koo koo koo-roo." I wrote to a seating company, so I thought why not stand? Huh? "Mr. Albert Meyer, American Seating Company. I had a seating question and was referred to you because you manufacture stadium seating. When entering or exiting a row, which is the proper side to face the person sitting down? Rear to them or crotch to them? Last week at a sporting event, I had to leave my seat. There was a row of people all from the same family. I moved down the row realizing my buttocks were not two inches from this guy's entire family. But then again, if I turned around and moved down the aisle the other way, I would have shown his entire family my crotch. Isn't that worse? Stadium seating is the only situation in life where you can show whole rows of people your butt or crotch and it's acceptable. Thank you for your answer. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Mr. Nancy, your letter on crotch or butt was most interesting. In fact, in all 38 years of which I have been in this business, it is probably the most interesting question that I have ever been asked. I have shared your letter with numerous of my colleagues. But alas, we have no good answer. The only suggestion that we could come up with is for you to come early before anyone has arrived, stay in your seat for the entire time, and wait until everyone else has gone before leaving. This, of course, could cause an even more embarrassing problem. Sincerely, Albert H. Meyer, president, American Seating Company." I went to... I was in the city of Huntington Beach. Fine city. The parking is... is insane in Huntington Beach. I stopped at a meter, it said, "18 minutes for a quarter." What can you do in 18 minutes? Go get another quarter, that's what you can do. "Dear City Of Huntington Beach, I am moving to your city soon with my electronic nose blowing machine. I will keep this machine on my patio. My nose blowing machine makes a loud noise as if someone is blowing their nose. This may be annoying to some. The machine activates every two hours for nine blows, some short, too long, some only one nostril as the other is clogged. Sometimes it is four short noises, sometimes one really long one or a series of sharp honks. At 3:00 in the morning, the noise gets bad as I put the volume up to nine. Please send me information. My alligator's name is Ricardo." Ricardo. Mr. Nancy filled out the City of Huntington Beach's application for a nose blowing machine. Under "describe use of product," Mr. Nancy put, "blow my nose on people." And if you wouldn't mind, sir, just verifying this is the actual form from Huntington Beach, verifying that you see where it says "blow my nose on people" right there. You see it? Yeah? He sees it. I think I got a thumb's up. Yeah? Thumb's up! He sees it, Ted. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate you letting me break the fourth wall and talk to you. What is your name? You look like a... I don't know. I'm just gonna-- You look like a Carl to me. Maybe? Sort of? Do you mind if I call you Carl? Okay, let... let's call him-- It's on my bucket list to call a strange man Carl, so... Not that you're strange. I mean strange in the best of ways. Right. Right. - Uh, this is Ted. - Thank you for coming, Carl. - Thank you. - Thanks for helping us out. Carl, for your assistance today, I'm going to present you with a coupon for Degree deodorant. Thank you, Carl. Yes, Carl! Arms down, Carl. Keep the... keep the arms down. That's solid stuff, Carl. "Dear Consulate General of India, I have just heard that the Taj Mahal will now be remodeled into a Staples office supply store. Why? This is insanity. This is the Taj Mahal we're talking about. Will you stock jumbo paper clips? Who can assure me that this sacred monument will continue to stand as the regal shrine it is? Will you carry three hole punches? I look forward to hearing from you on this matter. Will you sell ink cartridges? I need many. Respect for the Taj Mahal. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." From the Consulate General of India. "Dear Mr. Nancy, with reference to your letter on the remodeling of Taj Mahal into a Staples office supply store, we have no such information regarding this issue. Please let us have the source of your information to clarify the matter. Sincerely, Jasprit Singh, Assistant Consulate General Of India." Oh. That was easy. "President Vaclav Havel, Czech Republic. Just a note to tell you how much respect I have for you and how our club respects the way you have handled yourself in the dignified manner you have over the years. I am happy to announce that we have bestowed membership on you in the Thousand Oaks Vacuum Club. We want you to be our treasurer. Take our money and invest it. If you think swimsuit netting is the answer, then buy it up. Buy ironing board covers if you have to. This is sponsored by Markel Pest Control. Your dignity stands as an endorsement to those less dignified. And don't forget, Markel is the best at getting rid of pumpkin odor." We'll rid your pumpkin odor. And they will. "With all the respect I have, Ted L. Nancy. Please send me a signed picture of you for my wall." "Office of the president, Czech Republic. Dear Ted, President Vaclav Havel appreciates your appointment him treasurer of your Thousand Oaks Vacuum Club. Unfortunately, it is not possible for him to give time to any other activity, apart from those required of him as head of state. Enclosed please find his autographed photo. With best regards, Vladimir Hanzel. No vacuum!" I feel the love from the audience. - Whoo! - I'm feeling it. It may not be love, but something's on me. Something's washing over me. I thought it was your love, but it... Something's itching me right now. I got it on me. Actually, it's very nice and I'm so glad that we are here because it's nice to see some theater. I watch too much television. I just bought a 62-inch TV, which is big, considering I'm only 59 inches. But it is nice to be here at the Geffen Theater Nightclub Hotel and Casino out here, right up here on the Le Conte Strip. This Geffen is one of our finest Indian casinos. Just be glad it's not a coffee shop. There's too many coffee shops opening. It's getting out of hand. These Starbucks are opening everywhere. Saw this morning a Starbucks opened in a Coffee Bean. So I wrote to the Harriet Carter Gifts. Are you all familiar with Harriet Carter? Maybe some of you are out there? They make these fine products, a fine company, Harriet Carter. And I wrote to them... "Dear Harriet Carter customer service, I want to order a product from you. My electronic nose blowing machine blew out. My neighbor attacked it. I think it over-blew. It was supposed to blow its nose 12 times during the night every 40 minutes. It reversed and blew its nose 40 times in 12 minutes. Is Shelly there? Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." "Thank you for your inquiry. I am sending information about the neti pot. It is not electronic, though. Sincerely yours, Harriet Carter Gifts customer service department. Mix saline solution using warm water. Tilt your head to one side and gently insert the spout into the upper nostril. Relax. If you are calm, water flows right through. Keep breathing through your mouth. Stay relaxed. $7.98." "Dear Harriet Carter Gifts, thank you for answering me regarding your electronic nose blowing machine. And thank you for the picture of the woman with the fireplace squeezer in her nostril. Many hours of enjoyment looking at it. Now I want to know if you have the electric chair. This is the chair that is designed to shock those peoples that need punishment. A wet spongy leather cap is placed on your head after shaving your head and leg. The Harriet Carter volt lever is pulled and 2,000 volts go through the offender. Some mess may occur. Also, do you have toe socks as others have told me? Harriet Carter is the finest company out there. - Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." -"Dear Mr. Fred Nancy, we do not carry the electric chair. But we do carry toe socks. Thank you for your kind words about our company. It is a pleasure to serve you. Toe-separating socks keep your piggies apart, dry and healthy. One size fits most. $6.98." "Dear Harriet Carter Gifts, thank you for answering me regarding the electric chair. I am sorry you do not carry it. Now, I was wondering if you carry the gas chamber. This is designed to gas those peoples that need punishment. Harriet Carter cyanide pellets are plopped into the compartment. A Harriet Carter lever is pulled and the poison gas is sucked in through the nostrils. Can I use the neti pot for this? Responses can include convulsions and excessive drooling. Some mess may occur. Also, do you have dog vests? Harriet Carter is the best company I have ever heard of for customer service, customer dedication and general customer-- need another word here. I will note it in my folder. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy. Not Fred." "We do not carry the gas chamber. Small reflective dog vest is $9.98. We have included an order form and an envelope. Sincerely yours, Harriet Carter Gifts customer service department." I have 21 of these Harriet Carter letters and replies. "Dear Harriet Carter Gifts, thank you for answering me regarding my gas chamber item. I am sorry you do not carry it. Now I was wondering if you carry the Harriet Carter Firing Squad. Some mess may occur. Also, do you have the Smart Mop for the "some mess that may occur?" Harriet Carter is the best company I have ever heard of. I will note it in my folder and show others. Respectfully, Fred Nancy." "Dear Mr. Fred Nancy, we do not carry the firing squad. But we do sell the Smart Mop. Smart Mop soaks up ten times its weight in water than string or sponge mop. It includes three shammies. $14.98. Smart Mop! I'm smarter than this mop! The customer is always right at Harriet Carter." - Harry Lecter! - Harriet Carter! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Let's go, 20 more! Let's do this! Would you like... Would you like a break? Maybe a little break in... - Really? - Of course. Is there time? Quick break. So sorry. - Time? We got nothing but time. - Nothing but time. Thank you. Ah! Ah! The customer is always right at Harriet Carter. Hi, Carl. How you doing? Do your thing now, go. Do it! Do you want solar panels? You can save up to 80 percent on your electric bill. Never pay an electric bill again. Are you the homeowner? Is Mrs. Pagliacci there? Larry! Has anyone seen the water cooler? Sam? We got him off Angie's List. $99 for eight hours. You all look so... so nice, and it's so nice to see people dressed up and nice and... the ladies in their nice dresses, men in suit and ties. You never see anybody in a suit and tie anymore. The only people you see now in suit and ties are in a coffin in a funeral home. That's it. You gotta literally be dead to put on a suit and tie now. Ordering Jinjiang Jiaxing Group Jiang, Fujian, China. "Dear Jiaxing peoples, I need to buy clothing for my chain of stores. I own Plus Size Batman Wear. For the big man in your life who dresses like Batman. Yes we have XXXL capes. We have 72-inch waist belts. See us for tights that stretch to a 500-pound man. Can you make this costume? China is a wonderful country. They fixed my computer. Respectfully, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Nancy, okay, note your requirement of obese Batman wear. We can do as your any size you want, please kindly advice the below style, is it okay for you? Best regards, Peter." "Dear Peter at Jiaxing Batman Company, thank you for your most timely email. It is quite appreciated in this day and age of internet disgust, revulsion and nastiness and untimely emails. I was quite impressed with your email and emailing etiquette, and lack of disgust and repulsion. All 14 of us here were impressed with the quality, including Morris who hands out the medicines. I am hoping we can do business. Respectfully, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Nancy, okay, noted. May I have your size? Please kindly advise. Best regards, Peter." "Dear Peter, once again your email is outstanding. Precise, concise, compressed, and concise again, and clear, and one more concise. I have notified the Email Association Of America, EAA. I sent them a letter by regular mail and rated this a 5B@. My shoppers are usually 600-pounders and above. Most have been cut out of the wall. Which reminds me of a very funny "cut out of the wall" story. This 1,100-pound man was being cut out of his home by firemens. They sawed a hole in the side of his house so he could be taken out. I turned to my companion and said, 'All this to buy shoes.' We both had a chuckle. Respectfully, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Nancy, okay, noted. Please kindly advice the following question: The material is cotton with 'spendex,' is it okay? Best regards, Peter." "Dear Jiaxing Batman Fatties, sorry for the three-week delay in answering your email. I am being treated for outbursts. Rudy! Let's get me some fatty batty prices. Ted L. Nancy." "No further reply." Ribbit. Look at us, trying to get a laugh here with some... Just a cruise ship horn, that's what we're relying on here to try to get a laugh. How pathetic are we, huh? Next you'll think we're gonna try to get a laugh with maybe some casino slot machine noises or something. So I wanted to take a cruise. I was depressed, I was on that antidepressant drug Zoloft. Which the side effects were nausea, dizziness and diarrhea, which, hey, is a pretty good Saturday night for me. "Dear Cruise Deals, I am interested in-- Dear Cruise Deals, I am interested in taking your 14-day cruise to Bermuda for myself and my companion Frito. Frito has a disability. He suffers from Tourette's sign language. This is a form of Tourette's Syndrome, where one shouts out obscene words. Frito is a mute and cannot speak. So he makes obscene gestures at strangers. Believe me, it can be quite troublesome to see an innocent couple enjoying the warm sun and Frito gives them the finger." I love the random laughter going on here, I love it. I love you guys, I actually love you guys. "I will be arriving by raincage from Lodi. Frito shaves every 30 minutes. Sincerely, Ted Nancy. Frito likes limes." "Thank you for allowing us to help you reserve your cruise vacation. I will work with the cruise line in any way possible to accommodate your needs for travel. Unfortunately, there are not any 14-day cruises offered to Bermuda. Best regards, Ramona Lemon." Oh, my-- enough with the horn! Stop it! Stop it! Carl, help me! Please help me! "Dear Chinook Winds Indian Casino, I want to sell ham sandwiches in your men's room. People eat 'em up. Why not? Call me Ernesto when we first meet. It's for me. It's an impulse buy that works 40 percent of the time. This sign should be in the men's room mirror: Yes, we have the potty melt. Forget about Ernesto. Call me Miguel. I need this. Try our sweetbread combo. Ask for a number three. Please do not request pineapple on your ham sandwich. I do not want to mess with this in the bathroom. I was told your casino was open to new opportunities in your men's room. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Mr. Nancy, we thank you for your interest, but at this time we are not interested in putting any business in the restrooms. We also have five food outlets for our customers. Again, thank you for considering us, but at this time we are fine. Sincerely, Shirley Twinton, purchasing manager. No ham sandwich!" "Dear Shirley Twinton, Chinook Winds Casino, forget ham sandwiches in your bathroom stall. I now realize it was a bad idea. I want to do tax returns in your men's room." "People need their taxes done, why not when they're on the potty? Call me Bernardo when we first meet. I need it. It's an impulse buy that works 60 percent of the time. Forget Bernardo. Call me Juan Carlos. I have to have this. Please do not request an extension while on the toilet." "I was told that your casino was open to new tax opportunities in your men's room? Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy?" Jackpot! "Luxury Hotel, San Francisco, I would like to check in for a week. I have a problem which I like to address to hotels I eat my mattress. Can you give me a flat rate so I will not be charged an excessive amount for the bedding I chew and nibble on? I am sorry I eat through my mattress. This is something I have to deal with. Especially when the mattress is chewy. I would like a set fee on what my charge would be for the gnawed and partially eaten bedding. Thank you, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Mr. Nancy, regarding your question about the cost of damage to a guest room, we would have to have the housekeeping department give you an estimate before your departure. Yeah. You see, without sending you the cost of all of our bedding, it would be impossible to answer this question. It might be better if I put you in touch with someone else." M... maybe Ron. Yeah, Ron. He would be good with chewed up bedding. Ron, at extension 103. Ron, who eats my lunch every day even though I put my name on it! Ron, who still owes me $4 for Bridget's birthday lunch! - Ron, who stole Bridget's-- - Wait, what... What are you doing? There's no hotel manager that walks around like that. You.. You look... you look like... You look like Jeff Goldblum in The Fly. I think I saw some... some bristly hairs... Oh, you still do... some bristly hairs break out on your back. You look like a praying mantis. "Mr. Nancy, I hope that I've been of some help to you. Best regards, hotel manager." "Dear Huntington Hotel, so nice of you to write back - my eating my bed. - I also chew on the drapes." - Ron! "This is only the bottom of the drapes as the top is too thick and I can't digest them - properly without massive gas." - Yeah, yeah, Ron! "Looking forward to a comfortable stay. - Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." - No further reply. Ribbit. Let me make my way out here with you fine folks. I hope the momentum of my weight doesn't catapult me into the audience here. I feel like some kind of a beach ball being passed around a festival. I wrote to the Best Western Motel in Reno, Nevada, which is a fantastic luxury motel. I don't know if anybody... fantastic... Anybody ever stay at the Best Western in Reno? It's fantastic and extensive remodeling going on at this one. There was new duct tape on the carpeting. I checked in, I said, "What kind of a view do you get for $60 a night?" He goes, "For $60 a night, you get a view of someone paying $80 a night." Checked in, got my tetanus shot, I went right up to the room. Slept like a baby over there, I crayoned on the walls. Terrible security at the Best Western. The security guard called me from the parking lot and said, "Is your car still here?" Maid knocked on my door, asked if she could clean up, I said, "Okay." She came in, she took a shower, she did her hair. "Dear Best Western Hotel Reno, Nevada, I will be arriving by tuna boat March 1, wish to make reservations at your grand motel. How can I be sure that I will be treated with utmost respect? Can someone help me with my respect when I check in? How much respect will I get? Seeking respect. Thank you. Respectfully, Ted L. Nancy." "Best Western Reno, Nevada. Dear Mr. Nancy, thank you for your interest in our hotel. I can assure you you will be treated like all other patrons that stay with us, and that is with respect. Respectfully, front desk clerk. P.S. I hope you are aware we don't have any docking facilities for your tuna boat. No tuna boat. No disrespect." - You still in there? - Yeah, I'm still here. Where am I gonna go, huh? You... you're on the floor in the dark. I'm in the Witness Protection Program! - You're on the-- - I got a whole backstory! You have no idea what I'm-- I got a lot of free time over here to work stuff out. I just want the audience to know that no actors were harmed during this production. Give it time, give it time. I wrote to the Ziploc plastic bag company. I love these household things, the plastic bags, Saran Wrap, plastic wrap, I love plastic wrap. It's gotta be the greatest invention in the world because before plastic wrap, you would just take the leftovers and throw them out. Now, with plastic wrap, you take the leftovers, you wrap them in plastic wrap, you put them in the refrigerator, then two weeks later you throw them both out. "Dear Ziploc plastic bag company, I have been using your bags for years to put sandwiches in. It does keep in the freshness. What is disturbing to me, and I want to be sensitive here, is I have noticed your bags are now used by people to put dog poop in. Your 'keeps the freshness in' does not work anymore. It is now hard to use my Ziploc sandwich bag when all I see is people walking around with bags of dog poop. Maybe you could make a dog poop bag so people could use that to put their sandwiches in. - Ted L. Nancy." - Hand in poop bag. "Hello. While I'm sorry to hear of your recent experience regarding Ziploc brand sandwich bags, please know we do not have control as to what others choose to store or pick up in our bags. Kind regards, consumer relationship center. "Dear Ziploc, thank you for your poop bag reply. After a close examination of the Ziploc bags, I have now keenly noticed they are also being used for marijuana. This is unacceptable to me as one who actually uses your bags for sandwiches. Am I the only one left? Who's really using your bags for sandwiches? Not moms. Not office workers. It's junkies and poop people. I'm having trouble eating my sandwich. Sorry, Ted." Junkies and poop people, oh my! All gone. Um, excuse me? This is the announcer. What time does Ralphs close? "Dear Topps Baseball Card company, in 1960, I was an employee of a hotel in Miami Beach where Mickey Mantle was staying. I was summoned to Mr. Mantle's room to deliver room service to him. He ordered an egg salad sandwich. As I was setting up the room service tray, I noticed Mr. Mantle clipping his toenails. I'll never forget it as long as I live. I watched out of the corner of my eye as he clipped every toe. He had trouble with the last nail, but eventually his diligence paid off. At that moment, the telephone rang." - Hello? - Hi, Mickey. - What are you doing? - Hey, baby. Leave the egg salad sandwich. I'll eat it later. "After Mr. Mantle left the room, I sat down and secured all the toenails that had been clipped off. There are almost ten toenails. Nine and some shavings, but a full set. I wanna donate this collection to your card company. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." Topps baseball card company was so impressed with the idea of such a collection that they sent my letter on to the Hall of Fame. And can you believe it? The Hall of Fame wrote me back. Dear Mr. Nancy, we're very interested in your story of the Mickey Mantle toenails, and how you obtained them in Miami Beach in 1960 while delivering room service. This is a fascinating tale, and we'd be interested in examining them before we reach any decision. Thank you for thinking of the historical importance of these items. Sincerely, Peter Clark, registrar." I wonder what Mickey Mantle's nails could be worth. I'm gonna ask my nephew Rudy to help me. He likes baseball and toe nails. He wanted to get insurance for the nails in case something happened to them on the way to the Hall of Fame. These are Mickey Mantle's toenails. And we need them insured. Because they're gonna end up in the Hall of Fame, with your help. Paul, what do you think each toe is worth? I don't know, I'm not an appraiser. But... See how many we have. Four, five, six, seven, eight... Two, four, six, eight... we have a full set. It's a full set. Plus, shavings. What is your uncle's name? Ted L. Nancy. Just like it sounds. He has a lime in his appendix. $25,000 contents, $100,000 liability... Rudy's on his way to Cooperstown. He put up a few signs, just in case the nails get into the Hall of Fame. I wonder if they'll get in. I have something that I think, I hope, that you may find interesting. Um, take a look at this letter. Remember that? If you like, you can read it out loud. "We are very interested in your story of the Mickey Mantle toenails and how you obtained them in Miami Beach in 1960 while delivering room service. Sincerely, Peter Clark." - That's you. - That's me. - Look at this, Mr. Clark. - My gosh. - Isn't that wonderful? - Look at that. Each toenail's at a position. - Wow. - This nail's the pitcher, this is third base, that's the big toe - on second base. - That looks great. Ready to turn a double play. I have some ideas. What would... where would you think they would go? Well, we have, as you might know, Ty Cobb's dentures, which are on view - up in the museum right now. - All right. Cob Webb was one of my favorite ball players. - Cob Webb was? - Yeah. - He was a great guy. - He's a great guy. I... was wondering if... if this could be enshrined here in the Baseball Hall of Fame. This would be... this would just make our collection. - Really? - This could be... the defining moment for the Hall of Fame right here. This is a dream come true for myself and I will speak for my uncle, Mr. Ted Nancy. - Great. - And thank you so much. - I wish I could meet him myself. - Thank you so much. This is Tim. Have you ever thought about a reverse mortgage? Live in your own home and get cash every month. Is Mrs. Pagliacci there? This is a government program for depressed clowns. Do you like mangos? Do you have teeth? Are your gums swollen? Hector! We got them both off Angie's List. Let me make my way out here with you fine folks again and I hope you're enjoying this as much as I am. Because I think you guys are great, and it's nice to hear your laughter. It's nice... Uh, it's a beautiful thing for someone to laugh and, you know, there's so much crime in the world, so it's nice to make people laugh. Right, I thought, you know, maybe I'll write to a comedy club, why not open a comedy club because there's too much crime going on. I stopped at a 7-Eleven on the way in tonight. There was a little sticker on the register at 7-Eleven. "Clerk has no money." Of course he has no money, he's working at 7-Eleven. They have to embarrass him too? How about a sign, "Clerk has no car, no followers or friends," or "Clerk has no CVS points." Nothing, he's got nothing. Then I'm watching a high-speed chase out here, I guess it was on the 405 a week or so ago. The guy must have been doing about 100 miles an hour and the police are chasing him. And he's on the freeway, this guy, and then he's off the freeway, he's on a side street, now he's back on the freeway. Now he's on a surface street. I'm saying, "Hey, hey, hey. I know this guy's a criminal. Say what you want about him, but he just showed me two new ways to get home." So I thought, why not open a comedy club, you know? Let's make, uh... let's make that happen. So I wrote to the, "Dear city of Glendale business licenses, can you tell me what happened to the application for my license for my comedy club, The Jokestrap? The Jokestrap is 17 tables in a mini mall. All comedy club food including fried cheese yums are on order. We may have burnt almond cheese straws. I hire locally and use local cheese. Respectfully, Ted L. Nancy." "City of Glendale, - The Jokestrap Comedy Club. Dear applicant, the Building Department has not received such an application regarding your business. Yours truly, License Department." "Dear City of Downey Business Licenses, it is been some time since I sent in my application for my comedy club Joke Itch. Joke Itch is 22 tables in an industrial area. All comedy club food including cheese yanks and cheese squats are on order. May be under earlier name of Joke Ointment. I admire your city. I once yelled out the name Ricardo there in a crowd. We have already hired our headlining act, Tickles the Diseased Clown. Respectfully, Ted L. Nancy." "City of Downey. Dear Mr. Nancy, unfortunately the city of Downey has no existing records for an application of a business license for the comedy club Joke Itch or Joke Ointment. Sincerely, City Licenses." "Business Licenses, City of Norwalk. Can you tell me what happened to my application for my business license? I own a comedy club called Jesticles. Jesticles is 150-seat comedy club on a freeway off-ramp. Our opening headliner is Fumbles, the Fire-Juggling Epileptic Clown. You cashed my check. We don't sell cheese. Respectfully, Ted L. Nancy." "City of Norwalk... Jesticles. Dear business owner, I don't believe that you filed a business license application with the city of Norwalk. I checked our files and I found no record of an application for a comedy club named Jesticles. Sincerely, License Department, City of Norwalk." Jesticles, ha! "Dear Faårup Sommerland theme park in Saltum, Denmark. I am trying to locate my mother. I understand you have an employee working in your theme park professionally known as Dyna the Mighty Mite, real first name is Gloria. She is part of the performing Squeak Family of which Peepo the Wonder Squirt is her husband. She once belched up a crouton in your parking lot. She eats herring, has a freckle that looks like Michael Bublé. She does manatee imitations. Her catch phrase is, "I got a, I got a, I got a bad itch on my scalp." We have her fungus cream. Is my mother working at your theme park? Maybe at the Crumb Club. Thank you, Faårup Sommerland, for caring for others and helping others with people for others in matters. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Mr. Nancy, we have received your letter regarding our mother. Unfortunately, we are not able to help you out as we have never heard about her. We do not have that kind of performance in our park and all of our employees are Danish. I hope you will be successful in finding your mother somewhere else. Best regards, Faårup Sommerland Guest Relations." Excuse me, this is the announcer again. Anyone know if there's a Ralphs in Woodland Hills? Took a plane recently. I fly coach. Getting a little cramped there in coach. The, uh, the rows are just so pressed together. I mean, it's ridiculous. You're sitting-- There's no legroom anyway, but you're sitting there, the guy in the row in front of you leans back, his head becomes your whole trip. "Oh, I'm eating now with your head. Maybe I'll have a drink and read a magazine with your head." They now have luggage stores at the airport. Who is home packing forgetting this, huh? "Let's see, I have my underwear and my socks and my toiletries. I'll just scoop this stuff up in my arms and get on the plane. I hope I don't drop my underwear off in the aisle while I'm looking for my seat." "Dear Armour Meats, I want to take a 59-foot-by-22-foot baloney on the plane with me. Will it fit in the overhead bin? I need this baloney to arrive in one piece. Southwest Fun Jet C Group boarding. I think a hot baloney in a hot plane in the hot sun is not such a good idea. Huh? Hey, what time is it there in Nampa? It's 3:00 here. Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy, - Meat Chair Committee." -"Dear Mr. Nancy, I'm sorry to say, but we do not make baloney at this plant. I think that you may have your measurements wrong. A baloney 59-feet-by-22-feet would weigh 60,000 pounds. We wish you luck. Human resource manager." "Dear Colorado Belle Casino Lost And Found. I was visiting your casino recently as part of a semi-large to full midsize group. In my visit, I was distracted, confused, and lost from my group. Did you find a bag of otter hair? This hair is used as a second coat of hair for my 40-year-old otter, Louis. The hair is grayish, brownish, yellowish, with reddish striping. It was in a pinkish, blueish, greenish bag. I hope that's not confusing. I am concerned my bag of otter hair will end up in the wrong hands. Ted L. Nancy." "Mr. Nancy, I'm sorry we haven't been able to locate your bag of otter hair. Sincerely, Wilma, Lost And Found." It's probably in the dump. "Office of the Prime Minister of Greenland. Dear Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist, just a note to say that you are the best president of a foreign country I have ever seen. I admire you. And so do all members of our men's group that is made up of Greenlandians. There are 72 of us, 71 over age 50 and one who is 18 in November. We admire Greenland and what it means to be surrounded by all that ice. Without ice, what would we have? We would have no snow cones, no ice machines in hotels, no names for rappers. Nothing to chew on after we drink a beverage. Imagine a whole nation without ice. Freshen my drink. Can you please send us an autographed picture that we could put up over our refrigerator so every time we open the freezer door and get a blast of cold air we are reminded of you? With utter respect, Ted L. Nancy." "Dear Mr. Nancy, thank you for your letter and your interest in Greenlandic matters. I am glad to send you here a signed picture of Premier Kuupik Kleist. Mm... Yours sincerely, Assistant to Mr. Kleist." Little kisses! Mm! Mm! Mm! Well, we're at the one-third mark. Get you out of here about midnight tonight. Cushion crunch? More deodorant coupons. Everyone's gonna get a deodorant coupon. "Dear Sbicca Shoes, I am in the process of opening Ba-Nannys. This is nanny wear that is bright yellow like a banana. You will know that a nanny is in the room when she is dressed from head to toe in bright yellow. You go, 'Oh, it must be the nanny. She looks like a banana.' Could be some green on top like the stem. I need bright yellow shoes. Respectfully, Ted L. Nancy." "Hello. Could you send us an example of what you're thinking of? Thank you, Sean." "Dear Sean, thank you for getting back to me on my Ba-Nanny shoes. I now own Waiter-Melons. This is uniforms for the waiter industry that are bright red with black seeds on them like a watermelon. You will know that a waiter is in the room when he is dressed from head to toe like a watermelon. You go, 'Oh, it must be the waiter, he looks like a watermelon.' Possibly some green on the top like a rind, but I am open. Ted." Jackpot! "Dear Health Guard, I love your toilet seat covers. They make great cowboy hats. You pop out the top, put 'em on your head, you're ready for line dancing. I'm thinking of moving to Rangoon. What do you think? Thanks for making the best toilet seat cover out there.

"Dear Fritos... it has been some time since I wrote to you. All issues have been corrected. Andy! Except one. I still bark out men's names when agitated. Windex! It has gotten worse. I now yell out cleaning products. I am sorry. Lime-A-Way! Forgive me. Overall, though, things have been pretty good for me. I got to do this play and people seem to like it. They laugh and enjoy themselves. In the end, that's what really matters. Huh? I am still with my lady friend Phyllis. I am not her fiancé, though. She now considers me a person of interest. I put this woman on a pedestal, Fritos. She is on a pedestal. I think it was a pedestal. It could have been a curb. I just remember lifting her up and driving away.
