[MUSIC PLAYING] [SMOKE ALARM BLARING] Mike. No! Mike! Mike! [SIRENS] Go around back. Phil, quickly, get in there. There's people in there. Forget it. If there's anyone still in there, they're dead. You better tell him that. What the-- He's not even burned. It's amazing. [MUSIC - LAWRENCE GOWAN, "HOLDING THIS RAGE"] As the glow from the ashes lit the faces of the people passing by, they saw the victims die. They saw the victims die. When the news hit the papers, they said 19 bodies had been blown away. Somebody's going to pay, somebody's going to pay. Oh, yeah. Dangerous days are these to be living. Dangerous days, there's little forgiving. No, it just ain't in our blood, but holding this rage isn't your answer, boy. Holding this rage won't lead you on. Holding this rage will tear you to pieces, boy. Look what it's done. Look what it's done. Down the long line of mourners, see another young boy choking on bitter tears. Scars that won't disappear. Scars that won't disappear. Oh no. Oh no. You're going to have to sleep sometime, sweetheart. You looking for your mama up there? Because that's where she is. She's up there. She's looking down, and she's saying sleep, Mike. Sleep, my little miracle child. I'll protect you. VERN: Mike? Mike? Mike, we're going to be late. All right, Grandpa Vern. Coming. It feels like just yesterday we buried your mother. You know your grandmother loved you very much. I'm sorry, Grandpa Vern. She'd be so happy to see you here. There's a couple more in the bedroom. Your Grandma June never threw a damn thing out. I believe you. I always have, Jimmy. J. Masterson, Eastfield. Morning, Mike. It sure is good to have you back in the house. More tea? Yeah. You gonna stick around for a while, Mike, or do you gotta get back to the club? No. I think I'm out of a job. The Sox let me go. That's too bad, kid. You know what they say, that's life in the minor leagues. Hm. Although, Shreveport's looking for a pitcher, so I might go check that out in the spring. Well, you can stay here just as long as you like. Thank you. You know, I always thought Grandma June knew more about who my father was than she let on. She never knew anything, Mike. Your mother never told us a thing. I don't know why you don't try to get a job coaching high school ball. Yeah, you do. [MUSIC - LAWRENCE GOWAN, "LOVE MAKES YOU BELIEVE"] Down desperate roads sometimes you run for your life only to fine the answer suddenly slips out of sight. Yeah, you were fooled. I guess you should take the blame. Nothing can last forever. Those are the rules of the game. In the face of darkness, never hopeless, love makes you believe through the dissolution and confusion love makes you believe. How are you? Fine, thanks. I need a room, please? Sure thing. Sheriff Masterson, there's a young man here to see you. Sheriff Masterson, I'm Mike Hillary. Carol's son. Carol's son? Um, please, have a seat. So what brings you to Eastfield? This. I found it in a box of my mother's stuff. Isn't that you in the photo? You knew my mother? I worked on your grandparents' farm one summer. What year was that? You're a detective? No, I'm just curious. It's good to see you. You know, your mother, she was one of a kind. You look like her. How old are you? 24. So what do you do, are you a student? No, no, I play minor league baseball, actually AAA. Really? What position? I pitch. That's great. Did you know anything about my father? Who he was? No. No one knew who he was. I see, well, I guess I better be going. I'm sorry that I couldn't help you. Of course. Mike, it's really good seeing you. [MUSIC - LAWRENCE GOWAN, "LOVE MAKES YOU BELIEVE"] Down desperate roads, sometimes you run for your life only to find the answer suddenly slips out of sight. Sheriff, Mike Hillary is here to see you. Send him in. MIKE: Sheriff? Mike, you must have ESP or something. I was just thinking of you. They're looking for an athletics counselor at the community center, you know, coaching kids and stuff like that. I figured it's the off season. Here, use my name as a reference. Why did my mom leave Eastfield? Mike, there was a lot of talk, OK? What kind of talk? She's pregnant, unmarried. In the letter it said you believed her. What did you believe? If your mother wanted you to know she would have told you. She died when I was a kid, maybe she planned to tell me later. Fine. I think I have a pretty good idea why you want to keep this a secret, Sheriff. Jesus. Larson, do something. Larson. Larson, have you been smoking cigarettes in my office? No, sir, I quit smoking. Well, get some water and put this thing out. Welcome to the Eastfield Community Center. Sheriff Masterson spoke very highly of you. We have kids here special needs. Do you have experience with them? Well-- That's OK. We have kind of a mainstream approach here. We have special kids and so-called normal kids work and play together. And here's what we call our creative arts room. We put a strong focus on arts and athletics here. We find that it really helps their coordination and confidence. We like to have the children involved in as many creative activities as possible. I'd like to show you the swimming pool. Mike? Mike? The swimming pool. Oh, I'm sorry. What I was saying is-- OK, we're going to do some front floats with the flutter boards and, Sally, I want you to go first, and I want you to keep my legs really straight. And I want you to put your face in the water and blow lots of bubbles, OK? Ready? All right, get everybody wet. Good one. Good one. Are you next? Now this is our intermediate class. We find that physical activity really helps reach some of the more challenged kids, especially swimming. There's something very calming and nurturing about being in the water. James, you want to come in the water? You want play dolphin? I know you're afraid of the water, but you don't have to be. Who's the instructor? Oh, that's Jessica Randall. She's a grad student from Hunter. OK, I want everyone to take their flutter boards, and swim out to here. It's a race. Remember, lots of bubbles. Ready, on your mark, get set, go. James. We weren't formally introduced. I'm Jessica. I know. Mike, isn't it? Yeah. I hear you're a baseball player. Yeah. That's great. It's amazing what you did today with James. I've been trying to get him in the water for months now. It wasn't anything. Well, it worked. What's your secret? I don't know what you're talking about. He hasn't responded to anyone or anything in months. He responded to you though. How'd you do it? Do you really want to know? I bribed him. Hey, wait up. hey, I beat you. Well, I was saving myself for the final lap. Sure, you were. You want to come in for hot chocolate? In where? My apartment. I live in the back of here. Oh, yeah? I love it when you're all sweaty. Get the hell off of me. What's your problem? I told you to leave me alone. Who's this? Nobody, Blaine Hello, Mr. Nobody. You doing my girl? Why don't you get your hands off of her. Stay out of it. Why don't you back off, man. I'm trying to have a conversation with my girlfriend. Mike, come on, let's go. Mike. All I want to do is talk. JESSICA: Blaine! Get your hands off of her. Calm down. JESSICA: Get out of here. Listen to me for a second. Blaine, it's over. Listen to me. You're making and ass-- Come on, you pussy, take a shot. BLAINE: Listen to me for a second. Let her go. JESSICA: Blaine, it's over. Listen to me, it's over. Calm down. Calm down. Can you stand still for a second? What is wrong-- Get out of here. Blaine, it's over. Blaine. Stand still and listen to me. Blaine. Listen to me. You asked for that. Jessica, you OK? I'm sorry. No, no, no, it's not your fault. You sure you're all right? Yeah. Should we call the police? No. What are you talking about? These guys attacked you. No, don't do that. FEMALE VOICE: 11, you must obtain transport to the last known residence of specimen host Carol Hillary. Your bio maintenance human suit will deteriorate in 72 Earth hours. [HONKING] Got off the road, asshole, I could have hit you. Come on. Are you a fucking nut? Hello. Hello. Is Carol Hillary here? Carol died 16 years ago. Come in. Thank you. Where is Carol's offspring? You mean Mike? Mike is in Eastfield. What is his address? I don't know his address. I'm his grandfather Verne. Is he in some kind of trouble? Yes, Verne, he is. Stay back or I'll shoot. Stay back! Verne. FEMALE VOICE: Was that necessary? He would have contacted the authorities. FEMALE VOICE: That is because you handled that poorly. Although your English was correct, you did not demonstrate a mastery of human customs. He suspected you were a danger to his grandson. I am a danger to his grandson. FEMALE VOICE: Could we please attempt our next inquiry without the use of violence? It will attract unwanted attention to our activities. My mission is priority level 9, retrieve specimen at all costs, dead or alive. OK, let's play ball. All right, Tommy, you're up. Come on, keep your eye on the ball. You got it. Oh, almost. Strike 1. OK, ready? Swing. Oh. OK, here, let me help you out here. Choke up on the bat a little, move your hands up, spread your feet apart. Let's get a good stance here, OK? A good swing, right follow through, ready? Stay relaxed. Loosen up. Keep your eye on the ball. There you go. Run, run, run, run. All right. Go. Good hit, you got it. Come on, go to first. Go. Go. OK, second. Go to second. Let's go, come on. Mike, you OK? Mike, what's wrong? Why you running, freak boy? James? Mike, what's wrong? No. What's wrong? Is he OK? Yeah, just a little accident. James fell. He should be OK, but the nurse should take a look at him. I don't think it was an accident. He wasn't even here. I wasn't talking to you. What happened, Mike? I think Bart should tell you. Bart? I didn't do anything. Bart, James could've been seriously hurt. I don't care. I care. Every person is important and to pick on someone just because they're different, all that does is make you the smaller person. Mike? Bart, go get the nurse. Mike? Mike? What was that all about? I don't know. Did you see what happened? I'm not sure. How do I find the specimen now. FEMALE VOICE: Kill every living thing in Eastfield. He will be among them. That was a joke. Yes. That was funny. FEMALE VOICE: A more efficient approach would be to search nearby hotels. This guy is dangerous. He's a maniac. He tried to light us on fire. With what? Blaine's right, Sheriff, he did try and light us on fire. He is a maniac. With what? He, uh, used his hand to burn me. It's true, Sheriff. Manny was holding this piece of wood and then, poof, it went up. Oh, and why was Manny holding a piece of wood? I don't know, I just had it. OK, so let me get this straight. This one individual accosted the three of you for no reason while you were having a nice little conversation with Jessica Randall outside her apartment? That's right. And this individual had superhuman powers and flaming hands? Well, yeah. Get the hell out of here. - But, Dad-- - Blaine. But Dad-- Blaine. I've got proof. Is this your idea of a joke? It's no joke. This guy have a name? Yeah. Mike. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. I didn't see you standing there. Aren't you supposed to be somewhere? Oh, art, I'll take you there. Art is fun, huh? At least, that's what they tell me. Here you go, Mary. I got one for you. James? Motel man, I'm looking for Mike Hillary. Is he staying here? That's what I'm asking you. No, there's no Mike Hillary. Ow. FEMALE VOICE: Scan negative. That's correct. FEMALE VOICE: Once again, 11, you have failed to use the customary etiquette. I thought you were avoiding me. No. Don't you get enough swimming during the day with the kids? I'd live in water if I could. Why don't you come in? No. Suit yourself. Sorry about what happened today. What did happen? I don't know. You got a lot of secrets, Mike. Oh, come on. Hey. Oh, I see, so you want to play like that, huh? Come on. Huh? What are you going to do? The water's getting warmer. It is? Wow, it's getting hotter. Maybe we should get out? OK. That is so weird. Yeah, must be a temperature control problem. Well, it's never done that before. I don't know. Maybe it was you. So what time are you coming to my house for lunch? You're a little forward, aren't you? 1 o'clock. Perfect. So what about you? Where'd you come from? My mom and I moved around a lot. She died when I was eight. I moved in with my grandma and grandpa in Taylorville. What about your dad? OK. I can see I'm in dangerous territory. Well, I guess this is the point where I either say goodnight or I kiss you. You started this. Watch out. Mike. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Let me see your hand. It's not even burned. I'd better go. You're not going anywhere. Jessica, please. The other day with Blaine, the fire, you caused it. Why? How? Tell me. Tell me. Just stay away. Hold on. [KNOCKING] Yeah, just a sec. Afternoon, Mike. Sheriff. Mind if I come in? Yeah, sure, come on in. Sorry the place is such a mess. That's OK. How long you plan on living out of a suitcase? Well, this is fine for now. I hear you had a little run in outside Jessica Randall's place. Oh, that, yeah. That was just some jerk who she used to date. You know, wouldn't leave her alone. His name's Blaine. He's my son. I'm sorry. Forget it. He is a jerk. Kid has to grow up. He says that you tried to set him on fire. That's crazy. He's got a burn mark right here in the shape of a hand. You want to tell me about it? There's nothing to tell. Look, Mike, if something happened, I'm sure Blaine started it. I just want to know what happened. Oh, I see, so now you want answers, huh? I'm sorry, but I can't help you out. Now, if you'll excuse me. Damn it, Mike. It has nothing to do with that. Doesn't it? Before you were born, our mom and I were friends. I thought that she was special. Very special, but I was already engaged to Helen Boyle. I saw her the day after it happened. We found her up at Spruce Lake. God, I'd never seen someone so scared in my life. She could barely talk. I sat with her all night. You stayed with her? Your mother believed she was impregnated by an alien. And you believed her? Yeah, I believed her. She was one of the most honest people I'd ever met. Well, I'd say it was pretty convenient for you. That's what everyone else said. People ridiculed her. Back then it wasn't OK to be a single mother, especially around here. So you did know about me? Yeah, I did. She left town before you were born. Can you understand why she didn't tell you? Yeah, because it's all garbage. You're telling me my father is an alien? I'm telling you what I know. You don't know anything, so why don't you go back to your wonderful little wife and your big jerk of a son. I'm telling you the truth, Mike. Get out. Mike. Get out. Get out, if you know what's good for you. Yo? The room number. I think it's 17. You think it's 17? 17. 17, boys. Let's go. See anything? I can't see nothing. He's probably doing Jessica right now. Shut up. Sorry, man. It's true. Let's just go in on three. 1, 2, 3. Where the hell is all his stuff? I don't know, man. Check the can. FEMALE VOICE: Chromosome match, negative. Chromosome match, negative. Help, somebody! Hello? Come on. Don't hurt me, man. You want my money, take it all. Chromosome match, negative. You're not Mike Hillary. No, I'm not. Where is he? I don't know, man. Too bad. Wait, wait, wait, maybe I know where he is. Maybe he's with Jessica. Jessica? Yeah. She used to be my girl, but now she's dating that dirtbag. You take me. Take it easy, man. Take me to Jessica using customary etiquette. It's this one here. Enter. Call Jessica. Jessica? Louder. Jessica? Human, try that again, I'll rip your face off. BLAINE: You're not being very smart about this. My father's the sheriff. He'll get the National Guard after you. Are you listening to me? Jessica is not here. Where is she? I'm not sure. Blaine? She works at the community center on Railroad Avenue. I don't know anything else. If you let me go, I promise I won't say anything to anybody. I know. Grandpa, are you home? Hey, Sarah, sorry I'm late. Oh that's OK. Somebody broke in my apartment last night. You;re kidding. Yeah. But they didn't take anything. That's really weird. Huh? Yeah, well, I better get going. Hey, do you think it was Blaine? Probably. Yeah. Come in here and have our snacks. Just take a seat over here. Is everybody here? Good. Hey, does everybody have their snacks? Good. Hey, hey, hey, Bart, your own snack, if you don't mind. Say you're sorry. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry. You have more cookies? Here, you can have one of mine. FEMALE VOICE: Remember, 11, when interrogating the female of the species, optimal results are obtained through the use of politeness and decorum. Oh, hey, thanks. Hey, have you seen Mike? No. He's not here yet? No, I haven't seen him. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. Sorry, can I help you? Are you Jessica Randall? Yes, do you want to sign up your kids for swimming lessons? I'm looking for Mike Hillary. You a friend of his? Yes. He's supposed to be here, but he hasn't shown up yet, so-- hey. Get your hands off of me. You're lying. Mike? Call the police. Get the kids out of here. What's going on? Just get out of here. OK, we're going to do a fire drill. Hurry. Get them out. Move, move, move. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. Hey, you want Mike? I'll give him to you. OK, wait. Wait. I'm going to pick a group leader. Marcy, take all the kids to your house through the woods, OK? Hurry, go. Just go. Just go. Jessica? Jessica? Sarah? Mike. What's going on? I don't know. I mean, this guy, he's after Jessica. I called the Sheriff and I'm waiting for him. She's still in there. I don't know-- Mike. Don't, the sheriff's coming. Mike! What do you want? Who are you? I'm 11. I want Mike. Jessica? Come on. 11, you're relieved of your duties. Return to your shuttle. I don't think so. I'm in command of this experiment. I'm 66. This specimen is mine. I'm here to relieve you. Jimmy, thank god. What's going on? Jessica and Mike are still in there. Mike? Some guy is after Jessica and Mike went in to help her. OK, wait here. OK. Just hurry, OK? I think they're really in trouble. Sarah, just wait there. OK. You go down this way. I'm going to head over there. Yes, Sheriff. Hey, Larson, be careful. Yeah. FEMALE VOICE: You must return to the shuttle, 11. You are no longer authorized to remain on Earth. I want my bounty. Without the specimen, there is no bounty. He's got Mike. - Who? - He's got Mike. Who? Freeze. I said, freeze. Go. Go! FEMALE VOICE: 11, your bio maintenance suit is expiring. You must return to Spruce Lake within three hours and board the shuttle. Where are the kids? Oh, god. What's going on? Where's Mike? Are you OK? Where's Mike? Larson. Mike's car is still here, but he's nowhere in sight. I need more backup. I want this place searched from top to bottom. MIKE: Where am I? 66: You're in good hands. MIKE: What happened? 66: Just relax. What the hell do you want from me? I want to protect you from your destiny. What are you talking about? I've come to set you free. For thousands of years, we've been studying human and animal specimens for scientific research. Your mother was a part of an experiment. This is a joke. This is a sick joke. You're a valuable specimen. I was with your mother when she was impregnated. She was not harmed. Stop the car. Just let me out of the car, please? I didn't take you from 11 to bring you back to my world. I won't let them treat my own son as a specimen. No. No. It's the truth, Mike. I'm your father. No. Run, Mike, run. Stay off the road. Run through the woods away from the lake. I'll take care of 11. Where's the specimen? I set him free. It was mine. He's not yours. He's not mine. He's a living thing. You will not be returning. The specimen is mine. No. Where's the specimen? I set him free. You will die. 11, I think it's me you want. Time to come home, Mikey. I'm not going anywhere. You've learned to harness the fire. You're very strong. What can I do to help you? There's nothing you can do. This human costume also acts as a shield. I'm completely exposed to the toxicity on Earth. It will kill me. No. I'm sorry, Mike. There's so much I need to ask you. There won't be time. Now humans will have an alien specimen to examine. I guess I woe them that much. Are there more like me? Father. Sheriff, It's Mike Hillary. I just came to say goodbye. That is, if I'm free to leave. Sheriff, I'm so sorry about your son. You know, he isn't-- he wasn't a bad kid. It's not your fault, Mike. Trouble followed you here. You didn't bring it. I'm having one hell of a time trying to write this report. No weapons, no detonators, nothing was found on the beach, except this. I don't know what it is, but I'm sure forensics would have a field day. Take it. You sure you won't need this? I don't think Eastfield's ready for the truth. You take care, Mike. You too, Sheriff. You weren't going to say goodbye? Well, I thought you'd understand. I can't stay. Yeah, I was thinking of taking off myself. Not much happens in this town. So where are you headed? I don't know. I guess wherever they can use a tired arm, north, south. East, west. You want some company? Jessica, I can't. I'm afraid I'm going to hurt you. We can take some precautions. What? I'm not afraid of a little fire. No, I don't suppose you would be. You want to go for a drive? Whose car? I say we take yours. I have to man the fire extinguisher. I see. Hey, freak boy, where's your drool bib? [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC - LAWRENCE GOWAN, "HOLDING THIS RAGE"] As the glow from the ashes lit the faces of the people passing by, they saw the victims die. They saw the victims die. When the news hit the papers, they said 19 bodies had been blown away. Somebody's gonna pay. Somebody's gonna pay. Oh, yeah. In the face of darkness, never hopeless, love makes you believe through the dissolution, the confusion, love makes you believe. Ah, [INAUDIBLE] hate the world. It only is what it is. Half of it's run by losers, leave the rest to the kids.
