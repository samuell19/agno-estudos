Let go! Let go! Goddamn pigs. I don't want to... I'm registered. I can go hooking whenever I want. I've been to the doc just yesterday. You should take car of the rich people first. Then you can go after the hookers. Slow down and be polite, I have no pornographic pictures or drugs in my pocket. Hey, hey this young woman surely doesn't have a grey card, right? No, I don't even know what that is. Kretschmann, what kind of job have we chosen? Out of all people you are asking me this? After 20 years I sometimes have enough of it. Are you going back to the office? Nah, I had it after this 17 hour shift. Shall I drive you home? No, I rather walk. Some fresh air will do me some good after all this. Can you be reached if anything happens? Don't cause me any trouble. It's colleague's Scholl's turn tonight. - Good night. - Good night then. HOTEL BY THE HOUR Freeze! Don't move! Police! Freeze! Don't you hear me! Turn around! Face the wall! Stand still or I shoot! Send 2 cars immediately, I'm coming with them. Double deployment! Yes, already on their way. Finally, did they throw a party for you at the police headquarters? Or did they get you to work overtime again? - Say 'good evening' first you comedian. - Fed up, huh? Tired. You still work like you want to become the chief of police. You've already made me overcome this ambition. - Well, it's not really my business. - Right. - Do you want one, too? - No, thanks. I already had one. I made you some sandwiches. Hm, how lovely. Housewife. Can I have your car keys? Where do you want to go this late? If you want to know exactly: I'm going out with a couple of friends of mine. - At 2:00 AM? - Yes. With the shitty weather, icy streets and snow in April? Unfortunately we can't take that into consideration. You don't want to go to the demonstration at the opera? - Yes, that's where I want to go. - You want to join these troublemakers? Listen. First, we are not some troublemakers. And this is not about some riot but a political demonstration. And second, this is against a state visit that we see as a provocation. And it's also a totally legal demonstration. This is where my son is wrong. The demonstration has been prohibited and that's why you are not going. That is so typical again. Only because some shitheads in Bonn don't like it. You don't really think that we will be stopped by this? We! We! We! Who are you? A couple of hot heads... ...who think that everyone over 30 is a bonehead, loser or washout. That's what you say. One could maybe forgive your disrespect. Maybe the older generation has really done too many things wrong that you have a right to criticise. But professional aggression, mob like hooliganism. No, I don't tolerate that. I don't want to fight with you, Dad. But I've been a grown up for quite some time so I will do what I think is right. I will go like thousands of other people. But your Dad you don't take into consideration. You for sure are a good investigator. But can't your son have his own political opinion because of that? Even our Chancellor grants his children this right. Yeah, he can afford to do that. But as long as you are living in my house... ...you will not completely defy me. And I don't accept that. That's why I will have to find my own place to live. I actually was always proud of my father but I'm afraid that all I have now is a grandfather. Good night. Damn, did he take my car after all. - Good evening. - Room # 10. - The next floor upstairs. - Come. - Look who is here, Mr. Krulich. - Looking good, the girl from the Balkans. Yeah, she understood right away what this is all about. - What do you want? - Is Lukas here yet? - No, he is 30 minutes late like always. - Do you have a lot of business today? It's ok. No one fucks around this time. The Johns start coming in at 10:00 PM, but that's when your friend is working. - You know, I have to go to the toilet. - So? Do you want me to hold it for you? Evening, Richard. Always coming later... I know, I'm sorry. My alarm clock doesn't work. Buy a new one then. You make enough money. - How was it today? - Like the Olympic Games. All fast runners. Mrs. Schuh couldn't keep up with changing the sheets. Anna was helping her, too. You don't have to recount it. I took out the 8,50 DM tip and the receipt is inside. That's ok. Oh, that guy Krulich wants something from you. - What? - Am I his aunt? - See you tomorrow then. - Good night. - There you are. - Goodbye. We are full until 1973. - I'm totally beat, you have to help me. - I don't have to do anything. - I don't want your help for free. - I don't do anything for free. Don't look at me like this. I'm close to having a seizure. I need something. - And I have to stay over night, too. - What about money? Tomorrow. Tomorrow for sure. Let me borrow it until tomorrow. Don't collapse right here and now. I don't need any trouble. - I have to lie down. - Hurry, room # 2. The key is in the lock. But hurry so the girls don't see you. - And the stuff? - Man, go before I change my mind. Thank you very much. There is nothing that terrifies you, huh? Sure, if you'd be in there! Give me the dirty laundry. What a damn slut! Huh, is that all? See, we missed the train and the next one to Neumunster doesn't leave until tomorrow morning. Oskar, maybe we could have catched the bus to Blankenese. - It would be good if you had any vacancies. - Yes, I can do smth but maybe because of the child. ...a little bit further down the road is another hotel. It's a little bit more comfortable there. It's no problem for one night, right mommy? No, no we are staying here. - As you wish. - Thank you. Mommy I have to go to the loo. Just a second I'll take you to the loo. Where is the toilet here? - It's right here on the first floor. - Thanks. See, now she has a tummy ache. That comes from all the yogurt eating. - But mommy. Yogurt is good for you, right? - Yeah, yeah you will see how it goes over night. - Good evening. - Good evening. Where is Anna? Where she always is. Where she doesn't have to work and I have to do everything. Ok, thank you. I wish you a good night. Oh and don't forget, we want to be woken up at 6:00 AM or we'll miss the train again. The gentleman to room # 217 please. No, no. Let me carry the suitcase. It's way too heavy for a lady like you. Let's go. Good night. Yes, concierge. It's me, I'm feeling real bad. Mario at Cafe Espresso across the street always has some drugs! I can't leave here now. I give him my watch as a deposit. And if anyone asks I have been here since 8:00 PM, ok? That's hogwash. And about the damn drugs, pull yourself together man. I will see what I can do. That's wrong. - Are you left handed? - No, why? Because you always hang the keys facing left. You are a pedantic man. - Tidiness is half of what life is about. - And money is all what life is about, and love. You are quite something. Swarowski can be proud of you. - He is gonna kill you if he sees that. - What do you like about him? He loves me. Even without sleeping with me. - If you don't let him wrap you around his finger. - Swarowski is a decent man. I'm saving up and when I have the money I will buy my own licence. And when we have our own taxi we can get our own apartment. - Got a cigarette for little Anna? - Here, you can keep it. But don't smoke around here. If someone comes in they might think this is a whorehouse. Well, we aren't a cloister either, are we? - Good evening. - Good evening. A double? With or without bathroom? - Excuse me? - With bathroom. - For the whole night? - We'll see about that. Room # 3. The girl will take you upstairs. Anything else? - Maybe a beer? - Oh, yes. Please bring us a bottle of Bordeaux. - Is that enough? - For the room? Of course madame. - And for the wine. The rest is for you. - Thank you very much. - Come with me, Franz. - Yes, madame. Canisius. Schneider here. Good evening. I'm sorry to bother you but Dr. Marshall is asking you to come back in. Now, after an 18 hour shift? You must've lost your mind. Scholl had an accident tonight and can't work. What exactly happened? We don't know any details yet. He lost control of the car and hit a lamp post. - Are you coming with your own car? - No, my son borrowed my car tonight. Ok, I'll send you a police car then. What a shitty mess. - That's right. What did you just say... - Nah, that's ok. I'll take a taxi. That's a good idea, too. - Why aren't you taking the Holstenwall? - Because it's been closed down. There was a fight about an hour ago. With the police? Of course with the police. They used water cannons on them. Usually I'm not a friend of the APO warriors but this time they are right. What is this guy doing in Germany? He only comes begging for money, so he can keep on leading his wars. And tens of thousands are dying. See, there we have it. Now they are here, too. We can't get through there. Something probably happened right there at the consulate. Let's drive around it over the Alsterbrucke then. Ok. Hm, seems like the cops have been beating them pretty good again. Yeah, yeah. The police have it hard enough. They have to take care of law and order. - Just stop talking about the pigs. - I'd say you do that, too. I happen to be one of them. Oh, who would've thought. You have to contact inspector Canisius immediately... ...'cause of the riot in front of the opera! Do you understand? His son was involved in the situation and he is heavily injured. Careful. - Straight to the ER. Heavy internal injuries. - An accident? Yes, professor Utersen has been informed. We need blood bottles. Do you have a light? Yes, sure. Next month I'm getting my diploma and... ...if things work out with the job in Bogota we can already go in March. They will take up most of your time at first, such a young engineer. I know, but don't give me any excuses. That he is the brother of my father. Rolf, you are 15 years younger than me. We have to be reasonable. Do you want to throw away your best years? - Just resign like this? - I have two kids. - You've been married for 16 years. - Exactly. But I love you, don't you understand? And I need you because I love you. I love you, too. Don't agonize me. I will talk to him. I will tell him everything. I won't give you up! Rolf, in God's name, don't do it. It will end in a catastrophy. He is hot-tempered and unpredictable, I know him. Hm, then we have to keep on secretly. - How much time do you have left? - He is not back until tomorrow. - I was getting worried that you wouldn't come. - Have I ever stood you up? - You look great. - You too. Can we go tou your place today? Nah man. My brother is home and he has no sympathy for this. Also, haven't I told you about this Katschi? - He is still not leaving me alone. - But it's over, right? - Yes, once and for all. I swear. - Good. What do you suggest then? I know a hotel from the old days. They don't ask a lot of questions. They even have apartments with a bathroom. What are we waiting for then? I'll drop off my luggage real quick and then we go have dinner. - Are you alright? - Yes, yes. I'm very pleased with your service. The young lady seems to be a good recommendation. Oh yes. She is very playful, too. Very good! You can pick me up again at 1:00 AM. Already at 1:00 AM? - I'll go in first ok. - I'll give you your share later Karl, ok? Ok, get inside. He's waiting for you. - Here? - Yes, here right on the left hand side. My nephew and me just want to drop off our luggage real quick. The rest is for you. Room # 23 like always. Mrs. Schuh, come here please! Just a minute. Good evening. We want to stay here overnight. Unfortunately my wife and I have forgotten our passports. - That happens. You are on your honeymoon, huh? - Oh yeah, exactly, yeah yeah. Come, we better leave. 30! - Room # 30? 30,00 DM! You will be staying all night? No, we have to... I mean we have to leave early. Our luggage is still at the airport and we... - How annoying. - Do you maybe have another six... Another 0,50 DM. For you. My wedding gift. Please, first floor. The elevator is working, too. Yes, concierge. You have to help me get some stuff. I can't take it anymore. I won't make it through the night. All your German sparkling wine is good for is washing your feet. I have ordered French Champagne! Champagne Francaise! Goddamn it! We don't carry French Champagne in this house. What a dump. Every ship I was sailing on had French Champagne. - Maybe you will get it done, huh. - Maybe a bottle of Cognac? Well, Cognac then. It doesn't matter what I vomit from. What a disgusting guy. Luckily he is too drunk to get it up. He has such a bundle of 20's on him. You don't have to bring us anything. He is gonna fall asleep soon anyway. Until then I will wait. I still don't understand it although I've been in this whorehouse for 5 years. - It's a disgusting bunch! - Who, the hookers? No, the homosexuals. There are two in room # 23, you can recognize them from miles away. By the way, your guy is waiting for you. - Ok, until next Wednesday then. - I asked you if you have any vacancies! - Yes, please. Immediately. Here you go, may I... - Thank you. We'll find it ourselves! I have heard that you are waiting for me here. How nice from you. How are you? I had an argument with the boss today. I'd really like to quit everything. Don't take any shit. I can give you some money until you've found something else. Do you think I would take money from a girl? What do you take me for, huh? What does it matter who has the money if two people love each other. I haven't seen you for so long. You wanna be good to me? No one will disturb us. How many times do I have to tell you? When we are married! Understand! But not before that. I'm not one of those guys that come here. But I'm not a virgin anymore. Why don't you want it? I'm old fashioned, maybe because I really like you. - We have to get married. - Sure. When I have enough money but it's a long way until that happens. One should get a lot of money at once. Shall I go and steal something? You say it and I will do it. For you. For my love. Are you crazy? You mustn't even think about that. I'm not buying myself anything. I'm saving it all for us. I already got some money together. You'll see. Here, just today's tips. - You shall have it. It's for you. - Stop it Anna. You must be crazy. Why not? Take it, do me the favour. Please. Anna. You shouldn't be like this all the time. It's ok. I only need to shake my butt a little and the idiots... ...put money into my blouse. That is Lukas! Shit, more customers. - Am I gonna see you again today? - Yeah, yeah I will be back later. - Madame. - Tell me, wasn't there another concierge? Mr. Rehschopf maybe? He works the day shift. - So you don't know me then? - No, not that I would remember. Sometimes I come here when I want to be totally undisturbed. And I always get room # 25. Your room would be available madame. But I have something better on the first floor. No, thank you. I want the room that I'm used to. Room # 25. Of course madame. May I. Thank you. - Huh. - Not now. You have changed a lot since the last time we saw each other. - What's your problem? - Nothing. One isn't always in the mood is all. Are you worried about something? Shall I take you with me to Frankfurt? You could work in my store. I need money. A lot of money. I don't really know how to explain it. But Jurgen, you can talk about everything with me. Stop it. Mr. Superintendent. My son is seriously injured. - He is in the ER, he is at the heart station. - Mr. Canisius no one is regretting that more than me. I wanna hope that. Even more so since I have heard... ...that you haven't been totally uninvolved in this operation. As far as I know the details he wasn't attacked by any of our police officers. We have only reinstated the order. Yes, we always talk about order but never about protection and help. The men have only tried to push aside a group of demonstrators. That your son fell this unfortunate onto one of the fences was a tragic accident. But I have to take care of him now! Why? He is under supervision by the doctors. Everything is being done for him. And also, your wife can take care of it. - No unfortunately she can't. - Why not? Because she died 5 years ago. Oh. Well, you have to wait for the outcome of the operation anyways. We want to hope for the best. Temporary I have to ask you to take over Scholl's shift. But Mr. Superintendent I'm not the only police superior in the whole city. - You can't ask me to stay at the police station now. - I don't have anyone else available at the moment. I have to get out on the street myself. The State Attorney's orders, you know. There is nothing I can do. As soon as I have another man available you can leave. Understand? - Ok then. - Ok, see you later. And uhm... all the best for your son. Goodbye Mr. Superintendent. What a swine. Kretschmann. I always wished that my son would be more like a guy like you. And now... You know boss, when I was 20 you hadn't thought that of me either. - Is there anything I can do for you? - Yes, call the hospital again. Heart station. Professor Utersen. - Maybe we still have a realistic chance. - The left heart chamber still seems to work. We don't have much time left. Do they know who he is, yet? Yes, the son of a certain police comissioner Canisius. The father has already been informed. Ok, let's start then. - Listen, I am pregnant. - You can't be serious. I've been to the doctor. You have been to the doctor... that's nice... - And now you want to blackmail me... - Blackmail?... We haven't been together the whole time. Why do I have to be the father? - How can you say something like that? - Not with me, darling. That's the last thing I need. Do something. Take some pills or get rid of it. We don't live in medieval times anymore. Heinz, I'm pregnant in the fourth month. Something bad will happen if you leave like like this. Something bad has already happened. If my mum would know that I'm at a hotel with you... But I've promised that I'll be back home by midnight the latest. - They think that I'm at the ambassador's party. - We have been there. - And you? - Oh yes. Me too. You will be drunk in no time. I mean, you've never been with a man? - And how many girls did you have? - Oh, many girls. Enough. Not just necking and petting and stuff? You too. I gonna help you. I undress myself. You don't like it? Please turn off the light. - Are you a florist or a hippie? - Don't irritate me. I'm an aesthete, understand. Of course you don't understand me, but it doesn't matter anyway. And now something for further up. Do you feel something? Something honerable, something that makes things more cultivated. Ugh, it tastes disgusting. - You will see, it's delicious, like in paradise. - Never been there. You are my garden, My garden Eden. You know. I have had a lot of perverts, but with fruits and veggies... - And now... - What now? And now I'll have to harvest! Let me harvest your fruits. Let me consume your sweet fruits. You are my tree of knowledge. You are my philosophic tree! Oh my... You little pig! - Why? - Oh well, you do it with bananas. - And when do we bone? - Boning? Just a moment, I'm not ready yet. What? Do you need another banana? On your knees! - Shall we pray? - You have to be scared! You have to be afraid now! You have to scream now! I am Satan! I am Lucifer! Oh how terrible you are Lucifer! You consume me. - I'm dying with lust and desire. - Excuse me, I scared you. Get in the bathroom and wash yourself. I will follow you. Finally, that's more like it. But take off your firefighter's helmet, I don't want to get injured. I'll be ready in a minute my paradise bird. What makes you think of birds? - I can't do that, mister. - You are not risking anything. If you dont give me the room number I'll wait right here and if I'll have to wait until tomorrow morning. - You know that one can wait for a very long time? - I know that, mister. She is my wife. I know that she comes here often, they told me. I'm not going to make a scene. I only want to tell her that I will get divorced. I gonna do it all quiet. I only need proof. The definite proof. - You don't want a shit storm either, right? - Room # 19. Maybe I come back later with another guy. The other guy is snoring his head off. - Has she brought the drinks yet? - No, not yet. But this must be her. Yes, give me the... Did you at least think about the children? - Please don't hurt him. I love him. - That's some kind of a service here... - You are a mean dirty scoundrel. - Herbert. Leave it, Beate. It's better for all of us that this hiding game is over. We both didn't want it. Not Beate and not me. - But now it can't be undone and I'll vouch for it. - What are you going to vouch for? Do you want to undo what has been done? I have to get anonymous letters about your dirty affair and secretly spy after my own wife. One more step and I'll shoot you down first! It's my fault, Herbert. It's my fault. But don't make the same mistake now. Think about the children after I failed to think about them.. We can't keep on living like this. So, did you change your mind after all? Yes. I think one shouldn't run off in vain. Can you go up and tell her to come to the Cafe Elisabeth. Don't you think it would be better if you tell her yourself? Yes, you are probably right. Hey, why dont you send your wife home for a couple of days. To the country. Oh, I have a better idea. Maybe the boss's wife could put in a good word with the boss. Maybe it's possible to move into the janitor's apartment. Then the boss's wife could always come to me when her pussy growls. But Franz, please. How are you talking to me? Excuse me, I thought I expressed myself politely. I'm sweating like a monkey. Yes, yes. You are doing it all right. You, too! Come here. You have to take my place for 10 minutes, Rosa. Here. That's barely enough for a roll of toilet paper. Cheapskate. I don't understand why you need to know what I need the money for. Is it for this Katschi guy? Stop it already. I told you that I've got nothing to do with him any longer. But he is still bothering you. He knows that it's over for me and that's it. And that's how I gonna handle it with anybody else who is getting on my nerves. - Does that include me as well? - You, too! - That sounds like blackmailing to me! - It just doesn't sound like it. And if I don't give it to you? Do you want your wife to find out what you are really doing on your business trips? The elegant man does it with little boys. The well known antiques dealer from Frankfurt is a homo, bah. What would your square customers say about that, huh? - You would do that? - Without a doubt in my dick. - What's the deal? - You wanna feel me up again, grandpa. Let me go. You pig. You dirty pig. I gonna finish you off. There you go, rat. Shit, man. Jurgen, are you still here? Why aren't you answering me? Kiss my ass you goddamn fairy. - We acted like to stupid boys. - Shut the door, you smell. - Jurgen I lost it, I know. I'm sorry. - What about the money? - Ok, but then you'll have to be back to normal again. - Ok! You have my word. I forgive and forget. I'm your nice Jurgen again if you are nice to me, too. I gonna show this guy. How did you get in here? Life can be so beautiful, Jurgen. And for the both of us as well. You will see. I want my money back! Where is my money? They steal like ravens here. Jurgen, why don't you say something? Murder! You are a murderer! - Why did you kill him? - Me? Why me? You are the killer! We have just begun surgery. I was just gonna check on him. What does the professor say? He said that he is in a serious condition. But with the professor he is in the best hands. He really is one of the best. - When will they know if he makes it? - I don't know. Maybe in 2 hours, maybe later. Go back home. There is nothing you can do here anyway, we will call you as soon as surgery is over. - Commisioner, Mr. Vohrbeck called. - So? ...Well, we got a case. Murder at the Hotel Ostend. - Oh. - Ok nurse. I will call you as soon as I can. - A girl? - A young man. Stabbed. - Any suspects yet? - At this whorehouse everyone is suspicious. Kretschmann, not everyone who has made a mistake is automatically guilty. Pulse and breathing is normal. - Blood pressure? - Too. Pat it dry please! Thread! Where is the room? - Number? What room number? Where does this lead? - Room # 24. - Where is this leading to? - Stairs. Attic. Make sure nobody can escape through there. - Please, don't. Room # 23. - But you said room # 24. - Excuse me. - Why are you so nervous? - If a murder happens right next to you. - Aren't you the concierge? - Your name? - Lukas Freud. Homicide squad is already upstairs, commissioner. Good evening. Hey you. Freeze. - I just wanted to... - To split! You come with me. - So you saw how the two of them came inside? - Please get me a Cognac. Can I go now? I'm a taxi driver and I have an advance booking. Your ID please. What are you doing here Mr. Swarowski? - Commissioner, I am... - Tell him. He's been with me. I'm the maid here. - Have you seen anything suspicious? - No. I really haven't. Goodbye. No. Unfortunately you'll have to stay. - I'm on duty commissioner. - Regardless. We all have to wait. I have to wait, too. This man wanted to take off. - I'm the night porter. - Your ID please. I didn't want to take off. I just wanted to check if the backdoor is closed. He tried to go back when he saw me. Why did you want to get out of the house Mr. Lukas Freud? But I've told you commissioner. The backdoor... - You must be sensitive. - Sensitive, why? - I mean sensitive for the cold. Coughs and colds. - No, but... Because you are running around in a coat without wanting to leave, Mr. Freud. Don't look for another excuse and show me the guest list. Did everyone get registered? Mr. Commissioner. It's illegal but it's no reason... - ... to be so nervous, Mr. Freud. - Mr. Commissioner, your Cognac. Thank you. Ok. Now we'll take care of the guests one by one. And search the whole house from top to bottom. You come with me. Herbert, please. I'm begging you. You mustn't do it. Let's try again. You mustn't do it. You have to be there for us. Police. Commissioner Canisius. Please excuse the disturbance. Can I see your ID's please? I'm afraid you have a lot to explain. - Was it my fault? - No. It was just too much petting. It's a nerve thing. You've excited me too much. That's what it was. And now you don't want anymore, huh? - I can't do it again this quick. - Is it always like this? - You are asking too many questions baby. - But we have to go home soon. - And what did I take the pill for then? - Safety first. Safe is safe. - Oh, Bill. How much longer? - Not too long anymore. It was a real shock for me when she said that she is having a baby. - And then you just took off. - Im a student and in the middle of... In the middle of your studies. "And it's fucking inconvenient that I got her pregnant. Let her take care of it. " That's what you wanted to say, right? Congratulation for your excellent personal attitude. But I came back because of that. Because you were afraid. First of the responsibilities and then of the consequences. No. I came back because I wanted to tell her that I will take care of her and the baby. The baby. It is your baby, too! Goddamnit. I have a son, too. He is exactly your age. - Good evening commissioner. - Good morning. Two rooms from here, in room # 23, a murder has happened. - Have you seen or heard anything? - Murder. No, in God's name. I was busy worrying about my own business. - So, how is it going? - We can fix it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Do you have any leads concerning the murder yet? - No. Can I go with them, commissioner? - Wait. - Nah, it's ok. Thank you commissioner. Here, she left this. Thank God she'll still need it. Daddy is coming with you so you don't have to be afraid. Did something happen? Yes, something did happen. Stay with your kid and stay on your room. We will come and question you. - Questioning me? - Yes, please go back inside. But I have to go to the loo! Did you hear that? She has eaten too much yogurt. She has to go. Well, sure. But please come with me now. You have to be irritated with all that traffic. Opening doors, closing doors... - Open the door! Police! - Oh my God, what shall we do now? Do something! Quiet. They need time to get dressed. We have to open the door. Go, open the door. What, they let you in here? Show me your youth ID's then. Do you speak German? - Shouldn't you be learning for your exams? - But I'm on honeymoon with my wife. Make love but dont lie. You are a little bit too young for this environment. - Where is your ID missus? - I forgot it. - How old are you? - Sixteen. - Name? - Heidi Strauss. - Where do you live? - Elbchausse 128. That's a pretty long way. Are you the daughter of State Secretary Strauss? - Yes, me and my husband... - Don't lie to me girl. He is the son of the American ambassador in Bonn. That's a highly political affair then, but no reason to cry. But nothing even happened. It was nothing. I didn't want to know this detailed. It can happen. - Is the superintendent here yet? - No. Let them both go home then. And we better don't mention anything to the State Secretary, huh. - Thank you and until another time. - Yes, but not here. Hello. Please connect me with 34-61-09. And ask for the heart station. ER # 2. Thank you very much. I wait. But I really came here with my gardener. - To talk with him about growing flowers, right? - That's none of your business. I wasn't feeling well so I lay down on the bed and Franz brought me something to drink. Franz, why don't you say something. Well, the tulips have to be planted and the rhododendron,too. So I... ...put some seeds in her, huh. Mr. Policeman, please. This really is our private business. Don't make a big deal out of it and let me go please. Attempted bribary of an officer and attempted misleading of an officer. Now you are in trouble madame. I let them go. Let them go? I explicitly ordered that no one has to leave the hotel. - They are just kids. - Kids? They are rascals. We know about the youth of today. Hanging around in brothels. In the old days they had been in the workforce. Not them. She is the daughter of the State Secretary and he is an American. Well, with the Americans nothing surprises me. - We are keeping both until tomorrow morning. - He is a diplomat's son. - A diplomat's son? - American embassy! Oh, I see. Shall we worry about this stuff too. - We got better things to do. - That's what I thought. You think you are pretty smart Canisius, huh? No, Mr. Superintendent. There is only one thing that's important to me today. - My son is being operated on for hours and hours. - I'm sorry but work is work. That's how it is with our job. And the officer who was involved with your son's injury surely just did his duty, too. - I hope so. - Well, it's not gonna be too bad with your son. These days with the medicines progress... uhm, the two can go. Come with me. Thank you very much again. Good night. Do you want to sharpen me with these? Come on. Open the door, police! That's the last thing I need. What am I gonna do now? You got bananas on your head, what can happen to you. If my aunt Esmeralda finds out that... ...I've been picked up by the police in an hour-hotel she will cut me out of her will! I gonna kill myself. I gonna end it all. I can drown myself. I jump into the river Elbe. Oh yeah. Do it. Or show your aunt your flower dress. Maybe she'll laugh herself to death then. We are on street level here, right? I just jump. He can fly, too. Who would've thought? - Oh, let's see who we've got here. - Ouch my foot. I think I've broken my foot. Oh, you have broken your foot. Well, you don't have to take part in the Olympic Games then. Why did you say you were the uncle of the victim? It was just an excuse. But that has nothing to do with the murder. I draw the conclusions here. For example trying to understand why you, who was in the room next door,... ...didn't hear that someone was being murdered in the bathroom. That is pretty hard to believe Mr. Gold. But I was lying on the floor right here and I couldn't look into the bathroom because the door was closed. You were lying there? Why were you lying there? I don't understand. You have to excuse me but I'm not familiar with the practices of homosexuals. We've been fighting and I fell down. I was groggy in that moment. And when you got yourself together again you killed him. No! I liked the boy way too much to do that. I swear! Please let me go home or there will be some inconvenient questions. You'll have to answer me some questions first. I don't want anything to do with it. I just can't afford to get involved in this. I'm living with my brother and he has a very weak nervous system. He would never understand that I come here every now and then. - You always come here alone? - Yes. - And always have the same room? - Yes. - Commissioner, I can't explain it to you. - You don't have to. I got my own problems, too. But the murder happened in room # 23,... ...room # 24 was empty and you were in room # 25. - You should've noticed something. - Nothing, absolutely nothing. I was in your room earlier. You can hear a lot through the walls. Well, when he got killed he had the water in the shower running. Huh, that you did hear? I would think very thorough about that. The superintendent will listen exactly to what you are saying and he is not as tired as I am. When they knocked on the door he freaked out and suddenly jumped out of the window. What an idiot. - This guy? - Yes, that's him. No papers and you don't want to give us your name either? A murder has happened here and you jump out of the window. I refuse to make a statement. - Do you know his name? - "Little Adolf", that's all. He's a weird one. With flowers and stuff. Want's to be treated the hard way. I didn't ask you about the details of your profession. Your control card! I thought you did... Last tuesday I was busy because... Officer take care of her. The medical control stamp is missing. Hey, why should I be dragged into this only because this weirdo jumps out of the window? And who is paying the money for the business I'm losing? You can tell that the superintendent. - So this is your milieu. - Please, stop it. Well, I wanted to sneak out. I would have trouble with my family. - I can't give you any names! - I'll take you into custody. And we will publish your picture in the papers. That is one way to identify someone. Oh my God, anything but that. Well, in this case... Adolf von Bateldik! Phone number? Please. Please, don't! My aunt Esmeralda will find out and I'll be worried sick. - Your phone number! - 76-77-87. You are ruining me. Check it. - Is that all you know about him? - Yes. - No. - And neither have you? No, commissioner. Nothing. - I haven't heard or seen anything, you have my word. - He was with me the whole time. - That's not true! - Yes, it is. - What isn't true? - He only has to open his mouth and he lies, the pimp. That's not true. You are only jealous because you don't have him in your bed. She has stolen the money. She was in room # 29 where the sailor was sleeping. I have seen her coming out with my own eyes. - You damn bitch. - Look behind the mirror in her room. - Sooo, missus? - Lies, all lies. Mr. Gold is ready to be questioned again. I'm off to room # 23. You continue here. Take her to her room and if you find money... What was it? Dutch Guilders? - Deutsch Marks and Dollar. - Stupid cow. It wasn't like this. I only took a little tip and... Don't come up with any excuses. Think of a mitigating reason and give me the money. His name really is von Bateldik. The flower grandpa's aunt almost collapsed on the phone. Collapsed? My aunt? That would be a real chance right there. Was her voice shaky? hopefull. Hopefully. Before she can take me out of her will. Check the attic, maybe you can find the murder weapon. Excuse me, did the hospital call for me? The hospital? Wait a moment, there was something. Could you please bring me a Cognac. A double Cognac. Bring him a Cognac. "Commissioner Canasius shall call us back please. " Please. Have you taken the key for room # 24? - No, why? Room # 24 was open, right? - But someone must have had the key. Please connect me with the heart station. Yes, I wait. This is commissioner Canisius. Thank you. If that was a double shot I want another one please. Yes, Im waiting. What's the deal with the key? Someone must've taken the key for room # 24 and hung it back here. It's hanging wrong. I hang all keys facing left. # 24 is hanging the other way round. It's the room next to # 23 where the murder... Sister. This is commissioner Canisius. Any news about my son? What, the professor is still operating? For God's sake, how much longer can it take? But it's not a bad sign is it? There is still hope? Yes. Thank you. I will call you back again. Thank you very much, sister. They are just operating my son. Heart injury. - An accident? - That's one way to call it. Suction! - Good? - Yes. Ligation! - Clamp! - Clamp. - Swab! - Swab. Scissor. Take out the spreader. Hey, you. I... I just want... Help me lift him up. - Now... Now... you have me... - Jeez, who did that? I don't know. I was lying on the floor and suddenly someone hit me from the back. - It doesn't matter. I confess everything... - You come with us. - Please. - Oh, thank you very much. The superintendent won't need them. But the woman gets a summon. - Well, good morning then. - She wanted to give me money. But I didn't mean it. The whole situation made me totally confused. Please commissioner, it would be terrible if my husband would find out. He is our gardener. - And if I get a summon now... - You just tell him it was traffic related. And I would recommend your husband to hire a female gardener. - When do I have to come to the police station? - When the white lilacs blossom again. Thank you! - But madame, if anyone knows about gardening it's me. - Oh, shut up you mole. Look who we've got here. Siggi Krulich, old customer. I hadn't thought that it will happen this fast. - Is he dead? - Yes he is dead. - Yes, but... - There we have it. Probably coked up. I can't believe it, him. - Ok, shoot. - Again? What do you mean again? Because I needed money for the drugs. It's not my fault, I didn't want to kill him. - Pull yourself together. - I had it. I can't take it any longer. Why did he follow me? The cop? If he had caught me I would have went to jail again. Security lock up. And then I shot at the cop. That's how it happened. Why are you looking at me like this? You know about the thing in the Romerstrasse. That's why you are after me. No Siggi. Someone got killed here at the hotel. That's why we are here. You are pigs! You framed me. Pigs! Damn pigs! I can think of several motives: fear, jealousy, hate. Or you just wanted to get rid of the blackmailer. Please. I didn't took my boyfriend to a hotel and then got a room to murder him. They could've identified me right way. Maybe you wanted it to look like self-defense. That's why you provoked the argument and the fight. - But you were surprised by the gun. - And where is the murder weapon? You could have thrown it in the toilet and flushed it down. But Mr. Superintendent. It wasn't me. I swear I haven't killed him. Ok, let's assume that you are telling the truth. Who could be the killer then? I don't know any of the people he hung out with. He only told me about one guy. A certain Katschi. - Katschi? Is that a nickname? - Maybe. That's how he always called him. But since Jurgen and me have been together... Since when is that? For 3 month. Since then he hasn't met this Katschi. - That's what he said. - Yes. And? But he always tried. Called, wrote letters. Didn't leave Jurgen alone. And... You think the victim was afraid of the stalking? Yes, great fear. You didn't spend all night just at the reception desk, right? You had the cleaner fill in for you for a while. That's what you said when you saw the key wasn't hanging correctly. The key to the room... the key to the room the killer might have come through. Where were you? And why did you want to leave when we came? You know, I'm not in the mood to hold a monologue. You should say something, too. Come with me. Is this your room? Maybe you'll find it easier to talk in here. Look what we've got here. They sell good these magazines, right. They are going to be legalized soon anyway. But for now you are still selling them under the table, right. That's no reason to be nervous. Do you have more of this stuff? - Or maybe some hash, huh? - No. - What's in here? - Nothing. Just my personal belongings. Oh, I'd like to see them. Please open it. Thanks. I thought your name was Freud. Mr. Krinelke! - Where is commissioner Canisius? - In the concierge's room. Do you have another room where one is more undisturbed than here? Undisturbed... Yeah, the breakfast room. Give it to me, I take care of it. - Where have you been the whole time? - I have questioned someone Mr. Superintendent. Uhm, Mr. Superintendent I wanted to ask you if I can leave. You can not leave! Everyone into the breakfast room please. You can't help me either Mr. Commissioner? Me and my wife. We have nothing to do with the whole thing. You'd have to explain the thing with your gun first. I wanted to kill her and him. And me too. - Do you still want to do it? - Not the two of them. Do you have kids? Small ones? And now they shall pay for what their parents did wrong? I can't deal with it. I could never forget it. - I love my wife. - Help her then. Be bigger than her. Go upstairs Mr. Dreegen and tell your wife that you are taking her home now. And then you rethink the whole thing again. - Mr. Commissioner I... - Think about how alone you would be... ...if you don't do it. Come with me Krinelke. Here, the key from the breakfast room. Facing the wrong way like the key from room # 24. Swarowski? Maybe he just isn't as pedantic as you. Come with me. Mr. Kretschmann please stay by the phone. I'm expecting a phone call. You are still saying that Swarowski didn't know that you were stealing? Please. How much longer shall I sit around here? - I have enough trouble with my boss already. - Read this and sign it. And now you. You belong together? All three of you? Well, that is your private business. But unfortunately a murder has happened here. I need details. Even if it should be embaressing for you. We are at an hour-hotel were you don't really fit in. - So, Mr. Dreegen? - It's absurd that we should be involved with the murder. You know, there are many things that are absurd. That a lady goes to an hour-hotel with two men for example. You don't have the right to make assumptions. You have to leave it to me what's right. - What have you three been doing here? - But I've already questioned them. The student Hogerth and Mr. and Mrs. Dreegen are related with each other. And because he doesn't know his way around the city they came to drop him off here. And you are telling me this now? I started working here before you arrived. That's how you want it, right? - You had room # 19? - Yes. Did you hear or see anything that could be related to the murder? We have only been to the room shortly and didn't notice anything. The three can go. And uhm... who is this Krinelke? - The concierge. - The concierge's name is Freud. That's what I would say if I'd read the protocol. We all have to concentrate ourselves, despite our private lives Mr. Canisius. - What's your real name then? Freud or Krinelke? - Krinelke. Hello... Look at this. Discharge papers from the prison in Butzbach. Interesting! - How is it going? Have you caught the killer? - No, not yet. Let the people with the child wait outside. Come with me. The poor child. Finally she has been sleeping and they wake her up again. - Come, let's go to the train station. It's time anyway. - But you said we should wait here. So you got this job under a false name? I had never found a job with my real papers. - Why have you been to prison? - Fraud. - And "someone" got you the fake passport? - Yes. - Who? - I don't know the man's name. - I met him at the train station. - I don't believe a single word you are saying. But believe me, I'll get you to talk. You'll get very talkative in my office. Mrs. Benoni, you were right next to the crime scene. Alone? Without company? In an hour-hotel? - A little bit strange don't you think? - I was resting. - Why not at home? - That is my business. - What did you notice at the room next door? - Nothing. Mrs. Benoni, didn't you say that you heard the shower next door? Yes. So the shower you did hear. Although the bathroom is on the opposite side of the room? But you didn't hear that two people were fighting? That Gold and the other guy were causing a real ruckus? All the screaming and the commotion you didn't hear? - Only the shower. Isnt' that strange? - I did hear the commotion but... - But did you see anything? - I didn't leave my room so I can't have seen anything. So I can't have seen anything. But you knew who was in the shower. It might as well have been Mr. Gold. You said "The one who got killed was in the shower. " How did you know that? I was only guessing and he did get killed while having a shower. How do you want to know that? He might've been killed first and then was placed in the shower. Mrs. Benoni, this Jurgen Mobisch was a very versatile man. - Where you related to him in any way? - I didn't even know him. Did the lady ask for a certain room or just any room? She asked for room # 25. And what room did Mobisch ask for. For him and his uncle? - Room # 23 as always because of the bathroom. - I why did have to be room # 25 by all means? - Because I always have that room. - You have been here before? And always to get some rest? Who is supposed to believe that? - Well, you'll be talking in my office as well. - May I say something about that? Mobisch was here a couple of times. I dropped him off here a couple of times myself. They always had something to talk about. But so that nobody could hear it. He was a guest here, of course he discussed discrete matters... Wait a moment, did Mobisch get you the fake papers? - No. He really didn't. - Of course. That's how it must've been. You met Mobisch and he got you the fake papers. You got all your money together and later when you had the job Mobisch came here as a guest. He made it seem like he was a friend of yours but the truth is that he was blackmailing you. He probably threatend you to tell everything. He threatend to destroy your new existence. And tonight you had it. - No, Mr. Superintendent! - What do you mean, "No"? I confess that he sold me the fake papers but that's all. I swear. I had to fill in for him right when it happened. He was gone for 20 minutes. Apparently he was out of the house. But he wasn't! I saw him sneaking around room # 23. That's a lie! I was at the Espresso for Siggi Krulich! - Getting a coffee, huh? - Ask them over at Espresso then! - Kretschmann! - Take Krinelke and Krulich to the police station. And you are coming with us, too. Mrs. Benoni. I got nothing to do with the murder. Please believe me! Police errors also happen because witnesses don't tastify at the right moment. You are right. I will say it... It was him! The woman is crazy! She doesn't know what she is talking about. You mean bitch. You always look through gaps and keyholes when other people are lying in bed. She is right. I can't help it. When the two were fighting I tried to see something. But the door to the bathroom was closed so I couldn't see anything. - And why are you telling us all this just now? - First you didn't see anything, and then... then.. And then... he came in and opened the door to the bathroom next door. And I saw a young man in the shower. He was standing there with the back to him and then... then he stabbed him. - Again and again. - You mean bitch! Officer, send the people with the kid home. I don't need them any longer. - You are sure that you recognized him? - Yes. Recognized? Huh! It's all made up by this terrible hysteric person. I recognized him by his shoes first. The shoes with the buckles. The shoes? Of course. I have seen them, too. Upstairs behind the bed sheet. - Where the pig beat me up! - You shithead. - Katschi? - So this is Katschi who killed his friend Jurgen Mobisch! - What are you talking about, goddamnit. - He wants to marry me commissioner! At least now you know why he didn't sleep with you, the faggot. He had taken your money and spent it with the other guys. He always asked for more and more and when you had no money left he started seeing the rich Mr. Gold. - Leave me alone. - Because you were sick with rage and jealousy. And today you finally got hold of him. You were following them and imagined what they were doing in the room. Then you came back down to pick up the key and got into the room. And there he was. Naked under the shower. And then you freaked out and stabbed him again and again. - Is that how it was? - Stop it. Yes, I made him pay for everything he did to me. - The goddamn pig! - I arrest you for murder. - Oh yeah? - Who is going to arrest me? Swarowski, don't go crazy. Give me the gun. Step back! Step back Kretschmann! Swarowski, drop the gun. - You won't get out of here like this - Oh yes, I will. And if I have to kill every single one of you. I'll get a lifetime sentence anyways. - Drop your guns or he will shoot. - Yes, I will shoot. Are you letting me go now or what? Where do you want to go? The house has been surrounded. - Yeah, I'll take her with me then and we will see... - Let the woman go! - Only with a hole in her neck. - Leave it, I'm going with him. It's the only way before a bigger disaster happens here. - I'm warning you! If anything happens to the woman... - That' depends on you now. Get away from there. Let him through and let the colleagues know. They shall leave him alone. Let everybody know! The man is really dangerous. Get in there! You drive! Faster! - But the traffic light is red. - Speed through. The others will be after us soon. Where shall I go? - Just straight ahead. - And what happens when I stop? Then this happens! Are you trying to frame me? You are driving back to the hotel, huh? - What happened, did you fall down? - No I got out of a car. Stop him! Help! Help! - He ran right into the car. Did you see that? - Oskar! - Stop, over there! - He has taken the child with him. Don't follow him, the child is in danger! Get away or I'll shoot! Lower this thing! Please step back! Step back! Step back further! Do something! Get the child off this thing! But then your child will die. There's nothing we can do right now. - Take the woman with you! - There is dynamite down there and a fuse as well. - I'm going down there. - I'm coming with you commissioner. No way. If there are a few of us he will panic and something happens. - Think about your son and let me go with you. - This is an order, Kretschmann! Come... - Please, please let me go back to my mommy! - Shut up goddamnit. - Swarowski! It's me, Canisius! - No, stop. Freeze! - I'm coming alone and unarmed! - No. No, you want to trap me! If you want to get out of here you have to tell us what we shall do. - Or something bad will happen. - Don't be foolish. - Don't hurt the child! - I'm not being foolish. I'm just igniting the fuse. Drop your gun or I shoot! - You got 8 bullets and you call that unarmed? - Let the child go! She stays with me until I'm free. You pigs! Run! Run as fast as you can! - There she is. - Get her out of here! Stay where you are or I will kill you! - With your own gun. - Try it. I dare you. I took out the magazine. I told you that I'm coming unarmed. You pig. You tricked me. I gonna finish you off. - What happened? - There's nothing we can do for him. High voltage. - There is nothing we can do. - That's what I'm thinking commissioner. There is nothing to look at. It's all over. Yes. The heart station. Sister Hedwig please. Sister Hedwig? This is commissioner Canisius. Do you have any... Oh, thank God! I don't know what to say. Is everything ok? Yes. Can I come? I'm already on my way. The professor is still there, too? He had a night shift as well then. Please sister. If my son regains consciousness tell him that his father will be right there. Thank you sister.
