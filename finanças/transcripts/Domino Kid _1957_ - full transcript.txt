[GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] [MAN SCATTING] [MAN SINGING IN SPANISH] Hola! [SINGING STOPS] [IN ENGLISH] Oh, pardon, señor. I did not know anyone was here this early. You would like something? Coffee. Yes. Black. We have excellent huevos. No eggs, just coffee. With the coffee some, Pfft, brandy for the nerves? Amigo. Sí? Coffee, pronto. Sí, señor, sí. [SPURS TINKLING] I did mean to offend the señor. But I cannot run my cantina when a man does not put something at the table beside his elbows. [GASPS] Like that?Ah, gracias, señor. But it is too much. You are looking for work around here? Just passing through. Ah, you like cigars. Un momento. I give you some fine ones. Ah, thanks. That clock right? Sí. Time I'm on my way. Oh, no, señor. You cannot go outside in the street now. It is dangerous. Why? There is to be a gunfight between an Americano named Trancas and a man they call Domino. How do you know? The man in the telegraph station is my brother-in-law. This Domino sent the telegram for this Trancas to meet him on the street here at 8:00 this morning. You might get hurt, señor. So I might. Oh, no, señor. Please, sir. Listen, señor, you must stay inside. They say this Domino is a very bad one. Don't believe everything you hear about me. But señor, there is...Now, suppose you stay inside. [GASPS] Domino. Caramba! [♪♪♪♪♪] [CLOPPING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT CONTINUES] Bury him. He is dead? He should be. Señor Domino, why you kill that man? Ask him. [CLANGING] But this is lower land around here. Grow most anything. I think the smaller ranchers will be interested in your proposition. I'll talk to them. You've put new life into this town, Mr. Harrington. Another wire for you, about Domino, sheriff. Killed himself another man for breakfast down in Santos. SHERIFF: Bob Trancas. Number two. Two? HARRY: Yeah. Last month he wrapped a wooden overcoat around a fella named Haimes up in El Paso County. And they say he's got more notches on his gun than anybody. All right, Harry. Don't go blabbing about something you don't know for sure. You'd better get on back to your clatter bug. Anyway, our hometown boy's making good in what he set out to do. Yeah, I hate to see this happen, but I can't say as I blame Domino. Everybody in town seems to know who this Domino is, except me. Well, he left Pradera before you have settled here. What is he, an outlaw? Oh, no, no. He was always a wild kid. More than the rest I guess, but never a real bad one. Oh, I've known him since he was 5, when his folks built the Double Six Ranch at the upper end of the valley. The one with the domino brand. Yep. That all belongs to Cort Garand now. Well, that's Domino's real name. Is he the only one left? Yep. Yeah, after his mother died, Domino went off and joined the Confederates, left his father all alone on the ranch. During the time he was away fighting, small bands of renegades were raiding and plundering ranches, stealing cattle, selling them to the blues or the grays. That's the whole reason that Domino is a gun hawker right today. There's no reason big enough to make a man take to the gun. Well, now, what would you have done if you'd jumped back from a war to your ranch half ruined, your cattle all gone and your father murdered? I'd have come to see you. Ah. That's what Domino did. The look in his eyes, and the way he talked was something terrible. There were five men in that raid. I was able to give him the names of four of them. Well, if you knew all of this, why didn't you go after him yourself, sheriff? I did, as far as my jurisdiction reached. But they got away across the border and then they split up. Some of them have evidently wandered back. Two of them were sorry that they did. Well, how did you find out about these men? There was a Mexican lad by the name of Juan that was working on Domino's ranch at the time. It's the same boy that's playing the guitar over in Rosita's Cantina now. The renegades shot him and left him for to give dead. But he was able to give me their description. So from the wanted posters, we were able to identify four of them. But there was no wanted poster on the fifth one, so we don't know who he is. But Juan would recognize him if he ever saw him again. Doesn't that make Domino a wanted man? To shoot down even a criminal in cold blood is murder. There's no murder about it. Up to now, he's killed in defense of his own life, and he's always been very careful. Well, I have no sympathy for this personal vendetta, but it's a good thing it's kept him away from Pradera. Why? He's a killer, no matter how you look at it. And there could never place for a man like that in our community. It would only lead to trouble. Well, he's had plenty of trouble. Up to now, he's been the hunter. But there's still three men to go. And it's my guess that they may be doing a little hunting of their own. And Domino don't even know who the fifth man is. [♪♪♪♪♪] I'd made a nice target if I'd been in that bedroll, huh? I wasn't gonna shoot you. No? Aiming at squirrels, maybe? No, that was just to keep you from shooting me in case you was to come awake. Ah. Let's have a look at you. Who are you? Name is Dragger. You working for a man named Ed Sandlin? Are you Domino? That's right. Then I work for Sandlin. He sent me out here to find you. Before I found him, huh? No. When he heard what happened to Haimes and Trancas, he figured you'd be picking on him next. But you can't get to him. He's got every road to town covered. I saw the men. That's why I built that fire, to get one of you over here. Pretty cagey, aren't you? But no one wants to gun you down. Ed ain't like that. He just wanted to get a message to you before you did something that would get yourself killed. What message? Well, Ed's an important man now. And he don't hold it against you for what you did to two of the old gang. And he wants you to know he had nothing to do with what happened to your folks. Nothing at all. He's sorry and he wants to square things with you. How? I don't know. But he'll tell you himself. He wants you to ride into town tomorrow and meet him at his saloon. I've got a better idea. I'll ride in tonight with you. I don't know what Sandlin looks like, so you can introduce me. All right. But you gotta believe what I told you about Ed. He's on the level. He says that until he squares things with you, his soul won't rest. That's where you're lying. What do you mean? Sandlin's got no soul. [PIANO PLAYING] Uh... Ain't sure he'll be here this late. Sandlin usually goes to bed early. Then we'll wake him up. Suppose you go in and find out. There ain't nothing to be afraid of. I told you how Ed feels. Well, I'll wait for him here. BARTENDER: What'll it be? MAN 1: Tequila. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING AND PIANO CONTINUES PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING AND PIANO CONTINUES PLAYING] MAN 2: Put your bets down, boys. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING CONTINUES] MAN 3: Bartender, how about a drink down here? So you crumbed it. Take him over to my place. When he sees I'm not there, I'll be ready for him when he comes out. Give me a quick one, Art, I'm a hurry. Come on. Stay put. When'd you come in? How about Sandlin? Look, he ain't here. Like I said, we're gonna have to roust him out. Get on down to the other end of the bar and stay there. Sandlin! [PIANO PLAYING AND CHATTERING STOP] SANDLIN: Rye. So you're Domino. Glad you got here without making any mistakes. Mistakes can get a man killed. You're so right. You made a big one a couple of years ago. I admit it. I tried to stop those fellows, that's why I broke with them. Now I want to right things with you, like Dragger told you. That's why I'm here. Maybe I can help you find Sam Beal. I know where Beal is. What about the fifth man? Fifth man? What's his name? You're not being polite. Maybe I should tell you something. You're in over your head. Haimes and Trancas were amateurs alongside of Sam Beal. I'll worry about him when we meet. Who's the fifth one? He was the key man. Murder's his middle name and he's fast. Where is he? Could have gone back to Kansas, I don't I know. Or maybe he learned what you've done, could be he's looking for you right now. What's he look like? You'll know him if you see him, when you see him. Looks like our business is about over. That's too bad. [GLASS TINKLES] Well, here's to your bad luck. Let's leave it the way it is. [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] [TINKLING] [SPURS CONTINUE TINKLING] [DOOR CREAKING] [♪♪♪♪♪] I wonder how many of my cattle it took to pay for this. You any idea, Beal? Who are you? How'd you get in here? You must have over a dozen investors in this layout, all like me. I asked you who you are. That's right, Beal. Pradera, Double Six Ranch. Remember? Domino. Oh, didn't you know? And I thought you were smarter than Ed Sandlin. What about Sandlin? You killed him too? Leaves just you and one more. You've stretched your luck too far this time, Domino. You seem sure. I am sure. Even if you're lucky enough to get me, and I doubt that, you would never get off the ranch. Let's try it. Hmm. Anxious, huh? Let me tell you something, Domino. What I did during the war, I'm not making excuses for and I'm not sorry for. While you squirts from North and South were blowing bugles and carrying flags, I was making money. It's a good I did. After the war, there wasn't a farm left you could grow an ear of corn on. But I got mine, and nobody's gonna take it away from me. A real red-blooded American. You finished? No. There were plenty of gangs operating during that time. I was just one man in one gang. That's the one that murdered my father. When you raid a ranch, Domino, you go after the beef, not the people. You try to stay away from trouble. If you can't stay away from it, someone gets hurt. Now you call that murder? What do you call it? Well, I guess this is the jumping off place. It looks that way. [GUNSHOT] [MEN INDISTINCTLY YELLING] [INDISTINCT YELLING CONTINUES] [♪♪♪♪♪] Well, it does do something for me, Marie, but I'd hate to name it. MR. HARRINGTON: If the model goes with it, I'll buy it. What's the matter with it? She says it's too frilly. And silly. No, thanks. I'll stick to my old sun bonnet. Hmm, maybe you can do something with her, Mr. Harrington. Barbara's been running this office so long, doing a man's work, thinking like a man, acting like a man. She's even beginning to look like one. Heh. I wish she'd look at one. BARBARA: Like you, Wade? MR. HARRINGTON: You don't see any other man around, do you? At least not as handsome.Of course not. And just what is it about me that attracts a handsome man like you, Mr. Harrington? Oh, there are things too numerous to mention. I think at first it was the eyes. Tell me, where did you get those great, big beautiful eyes? They came with my head. [BOTH LAUGH] Now, that I've got you in a mood, what have you worked out?About what? About what we've been arguing the past two weeks. Shipping costs on wheat. Yours is the only company that can freight it out of here for me. If and when you do have wheat to carry, the charges will be the same as I told you before. Don't you want me to make any money? That's one thing my father taught me when he was running the station. "Barbara Ellison," he said, "don't ever make a business deal unless you can make some money." [MR. HARRINGTON CHUCKLES] And I'll bet you're a better businessman than he ever was. With the chance I'm offering you, you could become a shipping magnate. Maybe someday even buy out the company. But I don't wanna buy out the company. I just want a good steady job. Do you realize there are thousands of undeveloped acres around here, all going to waste simply because the ranchers don't have the capital? All I'm doing is lending them the money for planting and equipment, then I'll buy the wheat and ship it east over the... Littlefield Freighter Lines, at company prices. Heh. I pass. I'm on my way now to see some new sections. Why don't you leave this rat's nest for a while and ride along with me? Well, I...The stage will be in at 5:00. You'll be back in plenty of time to unhitch the horses. And that's a thing I can do too. Lucky horses.Oh. [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] This ranch brings back memories. I used to play here a lot when I was a little girl. My family were friends of the Garands. Not the best soil in the world, but I still think I'll buy it. But this place belongs to Domino. I know. If he'd come back to work it after the war, he might have had it operating by now. Instead, he had to set off on that crazy vengeance campaign. He did what he thought was right. Do you approve of what he's done? No, but I know Domino. And he'll never sell the Double Six. Well, I wasn't planning on buying it from Domino. What are you trying to say, Wade? Have you heard from him recently? He hasn't written since he left last year. I ran into Sheriff Travers this morning. Domino killed two more men of that bunch, then his luck ran out. Oh, no. I can't believe that. Nobody could kill Domino. He's human, isn't he? But are you sure? Reasonably so. You see, he was chased by some men. They know they wounded him rather badly. They lost him in the hills and nobody's seen him since. But it isn't certain. Even a healthy man couldn't survive in that kind of wild country, and it's been weeks. Barbara, I know you were once Domino's girl, I've rather assumed or hoped, for my own sake, that it was over. Since he took the road he did. Yes, it's over. We would have been married, but... What's the good of talking about it now? When vengeance consumes a man, becomes the most important thing in his life, it's time he was forgotten. I think I'll ride back into town. I was gonna stop by the Owens' place while I was out here. You wanna ride along with me? No, you go ahead. I'll see you tonight or tomorrow. [PIANO PLAYING] [MAN HUMMING] Domino. The last time we sung that together, you were wearing a calico with a big bow on it. Domino. Now, the music woke me up. For a minute, I thought it was old times. Everybody in the parlor and you at the organ. They told me you were dead, Domino. Now, I couldn't die without seeing you first, could I? They said you were shot. Aw, it was nothing. An old sheepherder found me and looked after me till I could travel. Got here some time this morning. I was so beat, I fell in bed with my clothes on. Domino. Huh? It's finished, isn't it? I mean, what you set out to do. It is finished, isn't it? And that's why you're home? We'll talk about it later. No, I wanna talk about it now. It is finished, isn't it? I've got one more to go. I don't know what he looks like or anything about him. I came home to see if I could pick up a clue. I've got to finish it, Barbara. I made that promise. To whom? Your father? He's dead, Domino. Oh, let the law take care of the rest of it. I waited for the law once. Remember? I thought maybe you'd come home to settle down. I will, afterwards. I'll settle down and work the Double Six, just like we planned. Like we planned? Oh, we never planned this, Domino. I've got to get that last man. We never planned that you'd act and talk like a killer. That I'd always be waiting, wondering if you were dead or alive. Oh, no, we never planned that, Domino. Never. I'm no criminal, Barbara. You are to a lot of people. I've heard the talk. What talk? That you've become a professional gunslinger. That you've killed a lot more men that nobody knows about. That, really, you're an outlaw, and it's more than revenge that drives you. That killing has gotten into your blood. [CHUCKLES] Oh, no, Barbara. Folks here have known me all my life. They're my friends. Friends don't turn on you just like that. Don't they? Well, you walk down the street, Domino. You just walk down the street and then come back and tell me what they say. [♪♪♪♪♪] Barbara. Hey, I won. Hey, that's Domino Garand. Pa says he killed 12 men. MOTHER: Aah! Come on, boys. Get out of here. Come on, come on. BOY 1: My marbles! My marbles! It may seem a harsh wish, but I'd just as soon he never showed up. Think you can get a better deal on Domino's property from the court? [SCOFFS] That's not it. There are lives he could upset. You afraid of Domino for some reason? Why should I be afraid of a man I've never met? Oh, I didn't mean anything physical. You see, Domino always had a way with women, and he... Whatever your reason, you can forget your wish. MR. HARRINGTON: What are you gonna do about him? SHERIFF: No way I can stop him if he wants to come home. Hello, Cal, Mrs. Peyton. Good to see you. Why, how are you, Cort? Back for a visit? Oh, not exactly. Plan to stick around a while. How are the kids?Find, just fine. Well, so long, Cort. Well, hello... Hello, Tom. Why, it's Domino. Say, you're looking real well, son. It seems to surprise a lot of people. Well, there's a lot of news when a man gets as famous as you. But you had a job to do and you did it. Now you just put your shoulder to the wheel, boy, and make them all sit up and take notice. Thanks, Pop. How about a little credit? I need some supplies. Go right in and help yourself, boy. And what you can't carry on your horse, I got a wagon out back. [BOTH LAUGH] [MEN INDISTINCTLY CHATTERING AND GUITAR STRUMMING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING AND GUITAR STRUMMING CONTINUE] Domino! How are you, Juan? I smell that terrible cigar and I know it is you. Only you can smoke such bad ones, amigo. Sit down, have a drink. Muchacha! Bring a bottle. Tequila, no? Tequila, yes. I hear the news that you're back in town. Are you going to ranch, maybe. Maybe. Have you seen Rosita? Not yet. Where is she? Oh, she will be here muy pronto. Ay, amigo, we have thought of you so many times. And now, now we shall play for you what you always like to hear. I like that sad music you were just playing? Heh. No. Uh, maybe I was thinking too much of the malos hombres who made us very unhappy. Forget it. The bad things I forget. Ay, amigo, not how you and your good father give to Juan Cortez a place to put his head and work to make a man feel he's good for something. No, I do not forget when you to go war and Rosita, she makes job for me. Now I'm close with two friends. Salud. To kindness. Buenas tardes. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] JUAN: Hey, Rosita. Look who's here. Domino! Oh, Domino! Ha-ha-ha. How's Pradera's prettiest girl? Ah, my big Domino. And such a big liar. You hero. Hero? Ah, to me you are. You killed those banditos, and soon they will all be dead. I am proud of you.Thank you, Rosita. Oh, uh... Saw this down in Mexico. Thought you might like it. Oh, Domino, it's beautiful. Gracias. Oh, Juan, he never forgets. That's for the comb. I have a present for you. Come, Juan. [GUITAR PLAYING MEXICAN DANCE MUSIC] [ALL LAUGHING] Kind of nice being home again, eh, Domino? Hello, sheriff. Meant to drop in on you. Well, since you didn't, why, I came to see you. Oh, will you join me?No. How have you been? Fine, fine. [GUITAR CONTINUES PLAYING] You quitting this chase you've been on? For a time, till I find the fifth man. You got a line on him yet?No. No, and even if I did have, I don't think I'd tell you. You nearly lost your life in that last shooting. The odds against your survival are getting shorter each time. Why don't you quit while you're ahead? Are you trying to scare me, sheriff? No, no, no. Not you. Just thought maybe I could reason with you. Help you a little. Well, maybe you can. I'd like to get the Double Six started again. I hear there's a man named Harrington financing ranchers. Maybe you could put in a good word for me. Sure. Just remember, Domino, this last man is probably gunning for you right now. So be careful. You know, there's no defense against a bullet in the back, especially when you don't know who to watch for. He doesn't know what I look like either. How can you be sure? I'll see you. [GUITAR CONTINUES PLAYING] [ALL CHEERING] I am pretty good, you think, no? Too good. It's bad for a man's blood pressure. There is something wrong, no? No. The sheriff maybe said something? No, it was nothing. Juan, let's drink a little toast to Rosita. [JUAN SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [IN ENGLISH] She is beautiful. I'll drink to that. I drink to me too. Señor! Pepe, where have you been? No place. I bet he's hungry.Oh, of course he's hungry. He is always hungry. Didn't I tell you to stay here and I would feed you? Why do you run away? Señor. Yeah, boy? Señor Domino, do you need a hired hand? Well, now I just might. What can you do? I can ride, I can shoot, I can lasso. I am all-around, number-one, first-class vaquero. You are all-around, number-one full of lies. Señorita Rosita wants me to live here. But this is no work for a man. I will work for you. Sounds good. You go to the kitchen and tell Alonzo to fix you some supper. And after that, you will work for me when I can find you. Where'd he come from? I found him outside a few days ago. He looked scared, like I did once. Remember? Yeah. He has no family and he won't tell us where he's from. I could love him like my own. But to hold that one, ha! He comes and goes like the wind. [GUNSHOTS] [MEN INDISTINCTLY YELLING] It's that crazy Mario again. Every time he gets drunk, he wants to shoot holes in my ceiling. Why, Domino, what is the matter? Nothing, just being careful. I'll see you later. [♪♪♪♪♪] You're worried about Domino? Sí. Remember when he used to be so full of life? Now he tries to act gay, but his heart is not in it. Is it not possible this life he has fixed for himself, it is no good? Domino is a man with a strong will. Who can say he is wrong? Oh, Juanito, I'm afraid he will lose Señorita Barbara, the only girl he has ever loved. And there is only one love in the life of Juan. For two years now I have waited for the moment when... Yes? I talk too much. The night is cold. I think you'd better go in. You are right. Good night, Barbara. See you tomorrow. Good night, Wade. Mr. Harrington in? Busy. Sit down. [CHUCKLES] You know, that's the trouble with you ranchers. All you think about is cattle. But you know that that bench land between the Labados and the escarpment is a public land. Public land? That's right. There'll be settlers filing on that too. I intend to finance them through their first wheat crop if necessary. This check should see you through your first year. I want wheat, Mr. Davis. Good wheat. Thanks, Mr. Harrington. The ranchers in this country sure owe you a heap of gratitude. Good luck, Davis. Thank you. You're Cort Garand. Or should I say Domino? Come in. If you've come about a loan on your ranch, I can't help you. Just like that, huh? Yep. What's wrong with the Double Six? Nothing, as a cattle ranch. No good for wheat. That's all I'm interested in around Pradera. I'm sorry to hear that. I wish I could help. You just helped Ed Davis. His ranch is right below mine, the land's the same. Anything personal? There are things about you not to my liking, but they haven't influenced what I've just said. Not even Barbara Ellison? Since you've been seeing her, you ought to know all about us. I do. And I gathered it was a thing of the past. I guess you'd like it that way. Now, just a minute. You came in here about a loan on your ranch. I'll tell you what. I'll buy you out if you leave Pradera. As for a loan, I'm a businessman and you're not a good investment. You're thinking I might not be around to pay off, huh? The answer is yes. Even if you aren't shot, a man who's lived like you could never make a success of that ranch. Your presence could only bring unhappiness to people such as Barbara. I don't think we have anything further to talk about. And I'm a busy man. [♪♪♪♪♪] [DOOR CLOSES] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] What's all this? We're sending some of this water down to the East Meadows for the wheat farmers. Tell your men to turn that stream back where it was. You must be Domino. Sorry, mister, this is public land. You got nothing more to say about it than anybody else. Who told you that? Mr. Harrington. He had a government survey made. He warned us you'd be around making trouble. Double Six has depended on this water ever since the ranch was built. So pack up and get out. Now look, mister, we're just hired hands. No one of us is a gunfighter. Sure, you can make us bust down that dam. Mr. Harrington'll just have it rebuilt. So why don't you have it out with him, huh? Please, amigo, that is best. Whoa. BOOKKEEPER: If you're looking for Mr. Harrington, you can't see him because he isn't here. Where is he? If you want to wait...I said, where is he? Well, I think he went over at the freighter office. Surely you can't still be in love with Domino. You said yourself once, it was all over. Wade, he hasn't a friend left and nowhere to turn. Well, isn't that his own doing? It's no good for you, Barbara. You've gotta forget him. DOMINO: Harrington! So there's nothing personal in turning me down on the Double Six, huh? BARBARA: Domino, please. What I got to tell you is plenty personal. Get that dam torn down on my ranch and get it down by tonight. That dam cost money. It's gonna stay there. The water is gonna be used in the lowlands for raising wheat. I don't care what it's gonna be used for. If you don't like it, you take your claim to the law. You get that damn torn down by tonight or wear a gun. What do you wanna do, kill everybody? Domino! Domino! Do as he wants, Wade, or he'll kill you. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Evening, Domino. Evening, sheriff. Coffee or a drink? Well, make it coffee. Coffee. Knowing you, you can only be here for one reason. That's right. There's nothing you can do about it. This is personal. So were the last four. Those men were criminals and I was on your side then. But I can't take the same stand here. Then tell him to get out. He won't do that. But you can. No, I can't. The way I understand it, Harrington offered to buy out if you left town. That's right. Let me ask you something. What did I do wrong? I eliminated the men that killed my father. The same men the law was too lazy and too comfortable to go after. Now all of a sudden, I'm an outlaw. No, sheriff, if anybody leaves town, it'll be Harrington. And I don't care if he walks out or they carry him out. I can go along with everything you say, Domino. All except Harrington. If you kill this man, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING CONTINUES] There's nothing more we can do, Barbara. I've talked myself out. Why don't you see Harrington again? Maybe for you he'd change his mind. Oh, it's no use. I know his pride. And as for Domino, you just had his answer. Well, I'm afraid it's beyond us now. It's up to the Almighty to do as he sees fit. You best stay inside there. What are you going to do? Something I haven't done in years. What's that? Pray. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING AND GUITAR STRUMMING] [GUITAR STRUMMING CONTINUES] You're in the wrong place, aren't you? No, you are, Domino. Ever you've come home, it seems as though everything has gone wrong. It seems that way. But the important thing is, when is it gonna get right again? Killing Wade Harrington isn't going to help anything. It's just going to make it worse for you. You know, it's too bad Harrington doesn't see things the way you do. As a matter of fact, he doesn't see them my way either. But Domino, think of all the people he's helped and the people he can still help. Think of the the progress and the prosperity he can bring here. Is it fair for you to stop it? You're only one man, Domino. I happen to be the one he shoved. You heard what he said today. He can't buy me out, so he's going to make a dustbowl out of what's left of my ranch. If you kill him, you can't turn back. The whole country will hate you and you'll be forced to live by the gun for the rest of your life. Maybe. But I'll tell you this much. We're gonna find out. [GUITAR STRUMMING CONTINUES] [SIGHS] Domino. You've been sitting at this table all afternoon. I'm waiting for Juan. Where is he? At the ranch. I had a job for him. I bet you haven't eaten all day. Domino, what is the matter? Nothing, not a thing. You have so much bitterness in you, Is it because of Señorita Barbara? I'll get you some coffee. [WHIP SWISHES THEN GLASSES TINKLE] Puerco! [GUFFAWS] [ROSITA SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [IN ENGLISH] You know him? I have never seen him before. What happened? He got playful with Rosita. Take him outside. The creek was not opened, amigo. Instead, men with rifles have come to guard it. Mr. Harrington left me no choice, huh? [♪♪♪♪♪] Hey, you! Get back there. What do you want?Shut up and move. That's the one that dumped you, Lafe. Me and Buck seen him. Him? You sure? BUCK: That's right. He dragged you here, then walked away. [CHUCKLES] He sure is a skinny guy to pack such a wallop. It was a bad mistake, boy. I'm gonna have to learn you some manners. But I...Take him back to the barn. Tie him over there. [CLOPPING AND FOOTSTEPS] [♪♪♪♪♪] [CHAIN CLANGING AND CREAKING] Buck, tie a handkerchief around his mouth. It gives me the jeebies to hear a hurt man yell. [JUAN GRUNTS] [CHAIN CLANGING AND CREAKING] [THUDDING AND WATER SPLASHING] Boys. You're about to see a man cut off his feet. What's this all about? He slugged me back in the cantina. That was me. He just pulled you out. Now, get out of here, fast! [♪♪♪♪♪] BUCK: Lafe, I got some news for you. Yeah? What? There's gonna be a shootout this morning in Pradera. And who do you suppose one of the gunmen is? Who?Fellow you're looking for. His name is Domino. The one that hit you. You sure? When's all this take place? In less than an hour. [GUITAR STRUMMING] [HORSE NEIGHING] [GUN WHIRRING] Amigo, don't go looking for Mr. Harrington. Listen to me, amigo. I know who the fifth man is. You what? You forget this fight with Mr. Harrington, I will tell you who he is. We've known each other a long time, Juan. We practically grew up together. This is not the time to play games. Now who is it? Only if you promise. You're gonna tell me who it is? All right. All right, Juan. Who is it? It was the same man I dragged out of here last night. I told the sheriff and he notified Fort Concho to be on the lookout for him. Why didn't you tell me? Because you have killed enough, amigo. You start by looking for five men, already you want to kill six. You're right. Everybody's right. I'm going home. Hey, Domino, I'm up here! Step away from that horse! Do you hear me, Domino? Step away from that horse! Too far away for that six-gun? All right, I'll move up closer. [♪♪♪♪♪] Close enough? This is as far as I go. [CLICKS] MAN: Domino, I hear you're looking for me. I'm your fifth man. [HORSE NEIGHS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT CONTINUES] [GUN CLICKS] [GUNSHOT] [GUN CLICKS] [GUNSHOT] Domino was not gonna fight you, Mister Harrington. He was only going home. He could have shot me to ribbons when I called him. He'll be all right as soon I get all those holes plugged up. Of course, he'll need a lot of attention from here on. MR. HARRINGTON: Move him over to my house. No. Take him to my place. [♪♪♪♪♪] I'll look after him. [♪♪♪♪♪]
