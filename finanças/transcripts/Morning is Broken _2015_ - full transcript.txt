(Man 1) Good to be back? (Man 2) Yeah. It's alright. Cheaper. The missus wanted to it out here, near the old school, so... (Man 1) Yeah, yeah... You, um, never wanted to leave? Not really, no. Each to their own, then. Ah! Thank you. Uh, Nick here restores cars, Sam. What kind? Anything, really. Mainly British classic ones. '50s, '60s Jags, Aston Martins. There's loads of collectors here. That's cool. Obsessed by anything vintage, this one. Nice. I was never much into ears. No? Just milly-waving, isn't it? Not interested. Give me a plane any day. That's how you make a statement. Depends what statement you want to make. A massive one, obviously! (Woman) Roland? Yeah? Are you coming up? Yes. My beautiful bride awaits. Good to see you, mate. Congratulations. Can I join you? Oh, seat's taken. - Oh... - I'm joking. Right. Alright, yeah. Cool. Amazing reception. Enjoying it? Not even a little bit. Your brother's good, though. Happy. It's all that matters, I guess. Enjoying being out of the city? Uh, it's fine. So what have you been up to? What are you doing? Uh, I've finished my first year at uni. It's medicine, so... - Right. In for the long haul. - Yeah. Saved any lives yet? Oh... Um... No, I'm not quite there yet. Right. Yeah. Nice? Oh, yeah, yeah. Try some. Nah, you're alright. Oh, no. Go on, I insist. What did I say? Mm. Lovely. Weddings are weird. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's like, um... It's like celebrating being normal. Well, cheers to that. Come on. What? I've got something to show you. Bought and restored it myself. New body shell, re-upholstered the interior. It looks fantastic. Do you want to get out of here? Have a look around. Want to go in? OK. Cheers. Could you just hold them as well? Cheers. Can I have ago? Sure. OK, just grab the oars. OK. That's it. And what you do is you basically pull it towards you. - Yeah? - Hm-hm. So you want to put it in the water and then pull it towards you like that. - No... No. - Oh, Sam. You alright? Come here. - I don't want to... No, no, please... - Alright, relax. - Can we go back, please? - Sorry. My mistake. - Can you take me back, please? - OK. Calm down, alright? Sam, it was just a mistake. OK? Just calm down. No, please don't touch me! Can... Alright... Sam! Sam! Sam! Oh, shit... Sam! Sam! For God's sake, man! What are you doing, eh? I'm sorry... I don't want to be like this. It's fine. It's OK.
