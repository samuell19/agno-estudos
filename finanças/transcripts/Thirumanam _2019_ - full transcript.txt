Friends and folks, you're listening to Hello FM. This is Mahesh chatting with you on the show 'Taaru Maaru Darbar'. We have so many facilities now to sing and listen to songs. There are many platforms for those who love to sing. You can sing any music composer's composition in your own voice. In olden days, if we wanted to listen to songs, we did not have too many options. We had to wait for Oliyum Oliyum program weekly once on TV. But now, we have options like MP3 player, mobile, Ipod and many more. Beyond all that, now each of us can even sing. Earlier, we called people a bathroom singer but now it's cellphone singer. You may try too. Before I continue our conversation on Taaru Maaru Darbar, let's take a short break. 'Hello FM 106.4.' Your program is nice. I watched the movie 96 yesterday. I loved it. But reminds me of 'Autograph'. 'Autograph' and '96' are two different stories. Vijay Sethupati's character in this one is unmatchable. But I cannot digest one thing. How can one stay unmarried in the memory of his childhood sweetheart? How is that possible? Why is it not possible? If love is true, it is of course possible to not marry anyone else. In any era. Can you do that? Why not? If it so happens that I cannot have you, I'll do it too. Because I love you. It sounds nice. But in reality, it cannot come true. I cannot prove it. Why? - That's because, you will be mine. I won't miss you come what may. Love you. Me too... No, that word itself scares me. Love you too. These are the bride and groom. They are in love. The story of this film is, how are they going to get married. Arivudainambi, the girl's elder brother. Additional inspector at the Income Tax office. He is 100% strict at home, and at work, he is 90% straightforward and honest while 10% proud. Has the driver come? - 'Yes, sir.' Did the car go to the airport? - 'Yes, sir.' He would've gone wearing a sarong and without brushing his teeth as it is an early morning flight. 'No, sir. He has worn trousers.' - So, he dressed up decently? Good. Everything should be ready by 10:00 AM for him. When I told him I have grown old and need a helping hand, he said one needs to be active at old age and fired the domestic help we had. Athira... Athira... She is impossible. She starts practising in the morning and makes some excuse to not help me. Boys keep frequenting here. You've learnt dance since your childhood. Do it every morning so that your body remains fit. Is breakfast ready, mom? - Yes, it is. Here. Have it. Even if I tell you that I will have it, you give it to me every day. Ten tablets remain by the month end. That is why, I have made this my duty. Why would I have bothered if you had it on time? You forgot, didn't you? Come, let's have breakfast. Did Athira eat? She has gone for a bath, son. Mom... - I'm coming, son. Come, I'm getting late. What's that sound? The people staying upstairs are doing something. They're our house owners. We cannot tell them anything. You have your breakfast or you will be late. Uncle, did you have? You carry on, I don't work in a Government office to go on time. What chutney is it today? You mean, you don't go to your travels office on time, right? Sister, I have no energy to argue with him. I'm going upstairs. Call me once he leaves. Okay? - You didn't answer my question. I am not coming this side. He is no less than Hitler. Do we have a military camp here? 'Manonmani, the groom's elder sister.' 'Her brother is her life, who means the world to her.' 'A Zamindar family! So, they maintain that attitude.' 'She calls the shot in this family.' (Chants) (Chants) (Chants) He is performing his prayers putting on his earphone. He takes an hour for prayer, every morning. (Chants) (Chants) (Chants) Saravana... Saravana... He comes late every day. 'The number you have dialled is busy on another call.' 'Please call again later...' Angamma... Angamma... - She hasn't come here, madam. Angamma... Angamma... Where did she go? Angamma... Madam... Madam... Who are you talking to on phone without bothering to close the tap? I was talking to our driver Saravana, madam. I see! Was he chatting with you since so long? I called him so many times. Without taking my call, what important was he talking with you? Should I pay you salary so that you sit and chitchat? Uncle! Uncle... Come here. - What is it? Listen to her. - Why are you screaming? Ask her. - What did you do? You nod for everything. Tell me what you did now. I was talking to our driver, Saravana over the phone. - Is it? Go there and talk. Go! Where do I get time to talk? I'm getting late. - Let him come. 'Both of them are standing right outside the door.' 'I need put up an act.' Hello, madam. - Hello, sir. He was cycling normally till the gate and now, he is panting. Why are you late? My bike had a flat tire on the way. Bike? You come by a bicycle everyday. You don't have a bike. Someone who passed by on a bike that had a flat tire. So what? How could I have ignored him and come after seeing that? I dropped him at a garage, got the flat tire fixed and then came. I called you, why didn't you answer? I was calling the garage guy, madam. - That's a lie! A lie! He speaks nothing but lies. 'She catches me even if I put up a brilliant act.' Angamma has told us everything. Should we pay you both so that you can chitchat over phone and watch youtube videos? Uncle, they will never mend their ways. Find someone else as soon as possible. Now, come and start the car. I need to go to the bank. Come on. Hey... Aren't you going to the bank? - Yes, I am. The bank is in the North direction. Don't go that side today. So then how should I go? If you go towards West, turn to East and turn right, it's South. Go from that side and you'll still reach the bank. I'll reach Salem if I take such a long route. Pay me for fuel. What?! You filled fuel yesterday. Why do you need money again? - Sir, come and push the car if it stops on the way. I will leave. Evil is ruling your tongue and mind. Uncle, you go inside. - And you, start the car. Are all the files and records in this? - Yes, sir. Keep this total handy. - Okay, sir. How many files have you covered in all? - Here... Here are the details of the company that you asked for. If you check this, you'll know who is original and who is fake. Full details? - Yes. Okay, sir. I have all the details. The action plan is ready too. We'll wait just because you are saying so. We need 64 people. So, inform them all. - Okay, sir. But share the information of where and what time we'll be going just one hour prior we go. I'm saying this for your good, Vijayakumar. Slow down, it will be good for you. Okay? - Okay, sir. Yes, sir? Are the details and files ready? Everything is ready, sir. Operation is ready too. File all the details and keep it on my table, I'll inform you. Inform the team members that the operation is postponed. Sir... We'll talk later. Firstly, get me the files first. Okay, sir. 'Hello FM.' '106.4.' Hi. - Hello. It's been so long since you played an Ad. Why didn't you take my call? Is Hello FM paying me to talk to you over the phone? Well, why haven't you played the song I asked for as yet? This radio station is not being run by your brother. If my boss learns that I play your favorite songs, I'll be done for! Okay, you get back to work. Hey, hello... What is it? Make it fast. I have work. Hello... What work do you do? Do you think this is fair? We've been dating since 6 months. But we haven't met even once. Why do you want to meet in person? We get along well on phone. Hello, don't be so practical. I need to meet you. Sir, here's the menu card. Thank you. Ice-cream... Which flavor would you like to have? Mango flavor. What about you? That's my favorite too. Waiter. - Yes, sir? Two mango ice-cream, single scoop. Do you really like that flavor or you said it only to impress me? You should have been a lawyer. I really like that flavor. Okay. Which juice do you like? Juice? - Yes. Well... Juice... Yes, I love Sapota juice. Sapota? - Yes. I don't like it at all. Don't you like it? - No. I don't like it from now on. Really? - Of course. I love to wear Churidar. I'd like it if you don't wear one. - What did you say? No... I cannot come for outings with you. I won't come. For a movie, or to a temple, I will never come anywhere. No calls, no messages after 8:00 PM. I have a mom and an elder brother. What they say is the final word. If they turn you down, I will definitely say no to you. Is that okay? - Okay. Bag. I will take that. Thanks. So then? What? Isn't there anything more? Nothing more. Why haven't you gone for work yet? I have taken an hour's relaxation today. Relaxation? - Yes. What important work do you have? Well... Actually... - Okay, move. I am getting late for work. Mom... Did brother tell you anything? About what? Your love song? Yes. I have no idea. You better talk to your brother directly. He talks politely only with you. So, you speak to him. Go! Shoe! Is it? I have never seen it. Why are you doing all these chores today? What use is it of? You are making me beg. You don't behave like a brother, but like a villain. Am I behaving like a villain? Do I look like one? Yes, you do. Mom... Listen... A small mouse has been running around the house since morning. Ask the reason. Tell him, it wants to know the reply of the big rat! Mom... What reply is she expecting? Ask her that. He didn't understand the meaning of my song. I am not able to arrive at a decision. I need to tell him my answer. Ask him if it's okay or no. Is this what she has taken an hour's permission for? I cannot give an immediate reply. I will take some time. Because... Mom... What? No matter who he is, but he will have to wait if he wants my sister. Tell her. Please spare me. I don't want to be sandwiched between the two of you. Don't let me beg you, I will throw away! Throw away whom? Your elder brother? No, him! You don't have to refuse him. Give me a week's time. Let me enquire about him and then I will tell you my reply. Okay? - Okay. Uncle... - Yes? Did he show you the girl's photograph? Yes, I saw her photo. She is as elegant as a Goddess. Okay, that's enough. Don't praise her too much. Are they a match to our family's standards? What's their family background? What does her dad and mom do for a living? How many siblings does she have? Enquire all these details. - Okay. Else, my brother might end up taking their responsibility. It will be good if she is the only daughter. I want these details in a week. Enquire in different places. - Sure. The astral chart, their names, their horoscopes, their birth time, everything is a perfect match. As per Numerology, he is number 3 while she is 7. 7 is a perfect match for 3. They get along very well. People who match horoscopes, also end up in a divorce these days, Mr Arivu. You won't believe, in the last year, only in the city of Coimbatore, 1750 people had applied for a divorce. Women apply for a divorce stating that her husband has bad breath. But basically, there are 3 reasons. First is financial issues. Secondly, difference of opinion. Could be taste difference or decision making abilities. But one of the main reason is sexual problems. Either too much interest in sex or no interest. Actually, in today's lifestyle the concept called marriage has become outdated. It's irrelevant. Everyone definitely needs his own space. Within that space, no one other than the ones they allow can enter. What happens because of that is, we share our frustration, depression and all our problems with a stranger, a complete outsider letting the one enter our life. We lived in joint families in olden times. We never found these problems to be big enough in that lifestyle. Because, we had elderly people in our family to guide those who had any misunderstanding or problem. See, before this cell-phone, if a husband had a fight and then went to office, he had eight hours to realize. In that time, he thought of old sentiments, thoughts, attachments and thus, the problem was solved naturally. But now, if there is a fight, we tend to react the next minute. We call immediately, scream or use abusive language. The words stay on our mind. The girl thinks, I am earning and why should I be looked down. Man thinks, he is a man and so, he can live anyhow. This is the thought process now. I have a personal assignment. I've found a groom for my sister. - That's great news. I want to know some details about the boy. We'll find out. - So... Here is his number. The call history of this number, every detail about him like his character, lifestyle, friend circle, I want everything in a week. Sure, I will do that. - Okay? You keep this. - Okay, sir. His name is Mahesh. He is a RJ in Hello FM. He does a program called 'Taaru Maaru Darbar' every evening. Listen to it for a couple of days. On the third day, send him a whatsapp message saying Hi. Appreciate his program. If he replies, you reply accordingly. Continue this for one week and submit the chart history. Right? - Okay. Keep a beautiful photo of yours as your dsplay picture. Sir, why that? I might end up in some trouble. Why? Are you afraid that he might hit on you? Sir, why are you making fun of me? If that can clear a doubt, simply go ahead. Sami, stay quiet. You need not be scared. - Okay, sir. Let us change the board of Income Tax office that's outside to Investigation Bureau. What say? Criminal officer! Dad, he is not liking the job he has in hand. He wants to start his own business, dad. It's only been six months since you got married. Let him continue the job. Post two years, we'll see what business he can start. No, dad. His parents have denied to invest money. They're also against the idea of selling any property. So, he told me to ask if you could help. I tried to explain several times, but he doesn't understand. We are facing problems everyday, because of this. Dad, please do something. Give me some time. Let me think, dear. Pandian... - Sir? Arivu would be inside, call him. - Sure, sir. I wonder what should we rely upon, before we get our daughter married. A girl's father is always worried all his life. Our duties don't end even after getting them married off. It goes on throughout our life. In olden times, we used to run a background check on a boy's family, his character, income and status. We agreed after assuring everything. But there is no such chance now. The girl and boy meet on Facebook, Whatsapp or Twitter and get to know each other. Where's the scope for a girl's parent to know her safety? Now... Within six months of marriage, my daughter has problems in her marriage. At least you get your sister married after checking everything. Don't make haste, and take your own time. That's because, a marriage happens only once in a lifetime. Give us some discount. - Sure, we'll work on it. Okay. - The actual price of it is 49000. Please think about it. - Excuse me. Is anybody here? Give me a minute, madam. Okay, madam. You may discuss at home and decide. I'll help you. - Okay. Yes, madam? Sorry, that customer walked in first and so, I gave them preference. Will you take care of only them because they came first? I don't understand this. Aren't there no other good staff in this showroom? Who is your boss? Call him. Madam... - I need to speak with him. Madam, I am here now. - Please... There's no other customer other than you. Tell me what you want and I'll guide you. Why call the boss? That sofa is very nice. What is its cost? Sofa... Give me a minute. Price... Well... This wall piece is beautiful. How much would it cost? Wall... Just a minute, madam. What is the price of this TV? That cot is so beautiful. How much is it for? Cot? Let me check its price. You have to check the price? Listen, that dining table and chair is very nice. Will you at least tell me its price? - Dining table... Okay, come here. - Madam... I really like this sofa. Just tell me its price. The price of the sofa? - What's this? I asked you the rate of so many items so far, you know not one. Madam, you're asking me the price of something else before I check one. You point at yet another item before I check its price. How can I tell you? You see everything with some patience. Ask me one by one. I will tell you. You are trying to put me down? No, madam. You did not know the price of a single item I asked so far. Is this how you work? They are paying such people. What a waste! Useless girl! You come to work just because you get bored at home. I fail to understand how people entrust such a big showroom on you. Excuse me, madam. 'What a waste!' 'Useless girl!' 'I wonder how they entrust such a big showroom on people like you.' Sorry, madam. I had to go to the washroom. The sofa is for 22000, the cot for 90500. These chairs and table, for 20000. Tell me what you want. Okay. I came to know the rates. I will buy them later. Will you? - Yes. Will you come again to buy? - Yes. Of course, you will buy, madam. What did you say now? You think we come here only because we get bored at home? It is you who have no work at home and so, loiter around all the malls for window shopping and pick up a fight. Mind your words, madam. What do you think of us? It is okay if you buy something. Why put up a scene only to check the rates? Please go, madam. Let me breathe some fresh air. Good. 'Basically, there are three reasons.' 'First is financial issues.' My elder sister is a fashion designer. She runs a boutique, sir. Our family is known as the family of Landlords. Sister's income, uncle's income from the coir factory and then near Anamalai, we have an agricultural land of 30 acres, sir... - Have juice. Thank you, sir. 'Difference of opinion, ' 'taste difference or decision making abilities...' How many years have you been knowing Athira for? Seven months. What more do you know about her? Her family is her first priority. She is a well mannered girl. She doesn't like if somebody lies or boasts. Okay. Is that all you know in these seven months? 'Nobody is willing to sacrifice anything for anyone.' Do you get angry, Mahesh? Very rarely, sir. My sister is very short tempered. She behaves like a demoness in a fit of rage. She thinks twice before giving up on something. She thinks what she says is always right. And then, our family is not a rich family like yours. You're too straight and lead a planned life. You have worked hard to succeed. Athira considers her mom and brother's word to be the final one. You are still living in a rented house. Athira has told me everything, sir. You both have discussed everything before informing your families. Let me repeat myself. Make a list of what differences you have or what problems do you have. Think seriously if you both will get along and then arrive at a final decision. Come in, brother. Did you finish testing the groom? I heard it took an hour. What such discussion did you have with him? I never discussed anything. Didn't you? - No. Come. Please come inside, I'll tell you. He told me everything that you spoke with him. What did you tell him? My ears are torn. She has been irritating me for the last half an hour. Whom? - Me. That you spoke ill of her and blamed her. What is mom saying? Let me go. - Now, listen. You and your brother speak to each other directly and spare me. Love is really such a nuisance. What? Is it love? Love is a nuisance, I say! Mom, I didn't drink water. You won't get water. - Hey! Did you tell him I'm short tempered? He really got on my nerve. He says, he wants to see how I behave like a demoness. Am I stubborn? He tells me to give him a list of things I'm obstinate about, so that he can stay silent. You told him everything wrong. I don't mind, I escaped. Thanks. This is his call history. He has been using the same phone number for 13 years. A person who does not change his phone number frequently and uses the same number for thirteen long years, it means he is a person who doesn't get into any trouble and is happy. That is, he has no love affairs or any connection with girls. You asked me where does he spend his leisure time. It's the library and music world. He has no habit of drinking or smoking. Very good. You have done a great job. What is your report? Show it to me. Hi... Thank you. Thank you so much. Is that all? Sir, he did not reply after that. He blocked my number, sir. What? - He blocked me, sir. Did he block you? I can tuck the shirt inside. But how do I tuck my tummy in? Saravana... Madam? Why are you all decked up today? They're coming to see the groom, madam. - See whom? Mr Mahesh. So then why have you dressed up? Park the car aside. Their car will be here any minute. They'll park right here. 'They can't see a driver look handsome.' We need not talk over there. Let uncle do the talking. Uncle, ask mom if you have any doubt. I am not going to say anything today. Neither will you. Uncle, everything is ready. Please call them up and enquire where have they reached. Why, dear? - That's enough. Are you planning to take him to where they are? - Uncle... Be straight while you talk to them. Don't agree to anything we have to regret later about. Speak only about things we can actually fulfill. This is just the first meeting. Why are you nervous? Let us go, meet them and talk. Things will follow. Uncle, we'll book a big banquet hall, organize for a grand orchestra, and wedding procession. - Sure. After all, there's a wedding in the family after so many years. People should speak about the wedding celebration. - Okay. We need to book everything that's the best. You don't worry, dear. We'll do it. For my brother's wedding, I want everything to be the best. Please come in. Come in, have a seat. - Come. Come in, madam. - Sure. No one has come. - Stay quiet. Hello, sir. - Hello. You are?- I'm a masters graduate and a driver here. They've hired a Masters graduate as a driver! Arivu... Looking at this big house, I guess they might ask for 50 soverign gold. It's not that. I told you, they're a landlord family. That's why, the house is huge. Looks like, they have recently rennovated. His sister is a costume designer. She owns a boutique and so, the house is neat and clean. What does it mean? What? I won't ask you. - You tell me what it means. Boutique is a place where one sells dresses designed and stitched by oneself. You mean, she is a tailor by profession? Why don't you call her a tailor then? You both confused me. It is not a tailor shop, but a boutique. Whatever it is, I just want the groom to be good. Right? Is everything okay? - Yes, it is. We must wait... - You do the talking. - Okay. Hello. - Hello, madam. - Hello. Hello, madam. - Hello. Please have a seat. Please... Have a seat, madam. Why is she addressing you as madam with such respect? How are you? I am good. - It's ruined. This wedding won't happen. Don't say that. How are you doing? - No, uncle. She came to my shop one day and I shouted at her. She must be someone else. Today is an auspicious day. It's better to discuss and finalize everything today. Go ahead. What's there to discuss, uncle? This is just a formal meet. We like the girl. More than our liking, my brother likes her. I'm happy. - So are we. So shall we finalize the proposal? If they are okay with my brother and our family, let us finalize an auspicious date to fix the wedding date. So that we can begin the preparations. Is that okay? Make necessary arrangements. What do you have to say, Arivu? What about you, sister? What we came for is done, without any hassles. Sister, you're the oldest here. Exchange the token tray. Wow! Shall I say something? What is it? - Our daughter will keep smiling in this house. How can you be sure? - Look at the old man. The bride and family are here with a wedding proposal for Mr Mahesh. Yes. If the girl doesn't like him, I have some scope too. If it works out, my life will be settled. That is why, I came prepared. Do you come to work with a plan? You just want to woo any girl from a well to do family. Don't you maids flirt with the owner of the house you work at? Really? - So we can do this too. Maintaining 30 acres of land, taking care of coir factory, sending the coirs that are ready to the wholesalers promptly. By God's grace, we are leading a good life with enough money. What is your monthly revenue on an average? It should be around ten to twelve hundred thousands. You mean, you earn more than ten millions in a year? By Lord Shiva's grace, we do so. Hope you file your income tax on time. What's that? Income tax. Tax on your income. Income tax... We've never attempted anything of that sort. Oh, no. Don't you ever pay tax on your revenue? No. Sir, you're fooling the Government. File your papers. Hold on. Don't make haste. What are you talking? - It's just a formality. Stay quiet for a while. Why all this now? Yes, Mr Narsimhachari. Yes, I have come out for some work. I'll send you an address on your number. Yes, that's right. A person here earns more than ten million rupees yearly. He has never filed his income tax returns. Yes, he earns a revenue from three different sources. Yes, I will send you the details. You send them a notice. Thank you. What's this? You came with a wedding proposal and are sending a notice? Sir, both are two different things. Filing income tax returns is good for you. Sir, you don't get worked up. He is working in the income tax department. Tomorrow, our families will be one. He is saying that for your good. I see. You don't worry, he will do all the necessary formalities. You won't have to pay any fine as you fear. What did your sister say? She is all praises for you and says, you're the perfect choice. What magic did you do? That's how it is. My mom is also all praises for you. She says, you're too soft and very silent. I cannot bear it. You won your mother-in-law's heart right in the first meeting. But I wonder how to appease your brother. Okay, hope sister did not take the income tax matter seriously. She was a bit worried first and then, she realized it is good for us to pay the tax. But my uncle is petrified. Okay. When are they going to fix the date? Wait for some days. Iyer, Mahesh's star is 'Chathayam' and his sign is Aquarius. The girl's star is Swati and sign is Libra. I have checked their astral charts and find them to be a match. You know it already. Uncle... Please stay quiet. Let him check and tell us. Why would only he advice? We must check what we know. It's about the life of our children. You checked my chart too, saying this. What happened later? Forget about it. What has to happen will happen. Praise Lord Shiva. Oh, no! Couldn't the crow sit elsewhere? That too, outside the astrologer's house. It won't let me rest. He is dancing inside a ball! Let me listen to some other song. Yes, he is the boss! What?! You wretched crow! Dirty... Where is it sitting? So many cars are here, why is it aiming at my car alone? Hey, you crow! Where are you? Here comes my stone! What's the sound? Looks like, something broke. Some bird's egg must have fallen off a tree branch. Uncle, a bird's egg won't make this loud sound. I wonder why did God give you brain to investigate everything. This is how he reacts on hearing the slightest sound. What will he do at the wedding? There will be a band and loud music. Shall we cancel that? That seems to be a good idea. Isn't it? - You be quiet. How can we not have trumpets and drums for a wedding? I will put in some cotton into his ears at that time. I will take it out once the marriage function is over. Problem solved. I'm glad no one saw it. I'll better sit inside and pretend to be sleeping. There are seven auspicious dates in the month of November. 4th is a Sunday, 5th is Monday. 9th is Friday and 11th again is Sunday. 14th, Wednesday, 25 Sunday, 28 Wednesday... - 11? Sunday will be convenient for everyone, right? Very good. Mom has said it. Is November 11th, Sunday fine with you? Yes, of course. That depends on your demand. What all arrangements you want us to make? What will be the expenses? If the expenses are not too high, I am fine with November. Your sister who will be coming into our family but whatever you give her is going to be only hers. We won't ask for a share. The jewelery you give her, the clothes and other gifts, are all going to be used by her. It's just that we're a Zamin family and so, if you do according to our status, it will be a pride for you as well. Yes. But we are not a Zamin family. We're a family surviving on a Government job and salary. We will do whatever best we can. Okay, let them do whatever they can. The banquet hall, catering, invitation and other expenses will be shared fifty fifty by both the families. If there's no problem with that, let's proceed. Yes. - Okay. Mom... Is that okay? - Yes. And you? Thank God, no one noticed. It's better I pretend unaware. 'CCTV!' 'For a crime free Tamil Nadu.' Oh, no. A CCTV camera! Everything would've got recorded in it. This Government is really very unfair. Let us all go to a temple together. - Sure, why not? Definitely. - We'll go. You don't worry about anything. - Okay. Okay, bye. - Bye, sir. Bye, madam. Bye. - Okay. Start the car. - Bye. Sir... The glass is broken. - What's this? Isn't that your car, sir? Yes, it is. - What had happened? A crow sat and the car glass broke. A crow sat and it broke? - Yes, sir. It won't break even if a crow fell on it. Hey, tell us the truth without beating around the bush. Madam, a crow dirtied our car glass and I cleaned it. It went and sat on that tree branch and tried to dirty their car too. I threw a stone at it, but my aim just missed. The crow escaped in a fraction of a secnd and the glass broke. Surprising! Since how many years have you been working? For the past seven years, sir. - Senseless! Senseless! Sir, you please leave. You come home, I'll take care of you. Sir, it happened by mistake, please forgive him. The girl's family is good. Why do they have a problem then? You brought your love affair till marriage. You say, you are in love since 7 months but have met only twice. Great! If we met often and spoke to each other frequently, there would be nothing left to speak and laugh after marriage. So, there won't be anything left to talk about, after marriage. And life will go on. In six months, life will start getting boring. That is why, we decided earlier. That we wouldn't meet or talk much. Wow! Superb! - Superb! So, buddy... The girl you have selected is brilliant than you. If that's not the case, there will be fights. Absolutely right. All the best, man! All the best! - Congrats! We should... Hey! Hey... We need to leave before 10:30 AM. Start the car. - There's no charge. I need to buy a new phone, the battery doesn't last. You... I'm asking you to start the car and you're busy charging your phone. Is this what we have bought a car worth millions for? You charge it thrice in a day. Whom do you speak with all day? Start the car, take us to Selva Mahal. Should I go towards the North or South? - What? Drive on the road, I will guide you with the route. Stop staring. Make sure, there's a huge car parking space. - Okay. Won't there be at least two to three hundred cars? Sure. We need to also check if there are separate dining halls. We cannot make renowned people sit with the rest of the crowd. Okay, dear. I will take care. Will there be a temple inside the banquet hall? A temple inside a banquet? People either have the wedding function in a temple or in a banquet. How can there be a temple inside a banquet? Uncle, think about it. If we have a wedding, the groom has to go on a wedding procession to some temple. If the temple is very far, to get the groom from there, they will need a car or a horse accompanied with a band and lights, which itself will cost about 150,000. Instead, if we have a temple next to the banquet hall or inside it, all that money can be saved. We'll ask them to build a temple inside the banquet. Is that all? Sir... What is it? It will be great if you could give me a salary hike. Why should I increase your salary? You've fixed Mr Mahesh's wedding. I need to buy some new clothes. There are a lot of expenses. Will Mahesh get married every month? It will sound fair if you ask me to buy you a new dress for his wedding. This is just an excuse for you to ask for a hike. Listen to me. - What? You better quit the job once he gets married. You've said that ten times at least but you don't give me any free time. What? - I am trapped here. Drivers these days are not good. When are the owners good? Uncle, the banquet is so big. They're a rich family, now we will have to shell out money too. Arivu... - Yes? Look, there's a temple. We'll save 150,000. Everything is happening as per your wish. 350,000 thousand is the rent for the banquet alone. Maintenance, cleaning, decoration expenses, including all that, it will go to 650,000. You will have to pay the entire amount in advance while booking. Uncle, if we pay the entire amount in advance... You talk to him directly. You say that the decoration will cost 200,000 rupees. Suppose, we don't like the decoration, we can get someone from outside and get it decorated, can't we? No, sir. We have a monopoly of these things in this banquet. We cannot allow you to bring anyone from outside. Excuse me, please. 'Arivu...' - Yes, Sami? 'Where are you?' - At the banquet. - 'Can you come immediately?' Why? 'Mr Vijaykumar is in a problem. Some men are here.' - Is it? 'I think it's something serious.' - Okay. I'll be there in ten minutes. What is it? - An urgent matter at my work place. I'll be back. My office is close by. Just half an hour. I'll be back soon, until then you please discuss everything. You finalize things. Come soon, Arivu. Okay, uncle. Well... Arivu seems to be very calculative. Only then can one live peacefully in this society. If one doesn't keep an account of his expenses, a family will be homeless and my nephew knows that well. You don't have an answer? He is sitting right in front of me. I'm talking to him. I will call you back. 'He'll keep giving you some excuses.' 'Don't come back without recovering the money.' 'He hasn't paid six months' interest or the principal amount yet.' Sir, excuse me. - 'Why are you quiet?' Someone is here, he has taken him aside. Let me see what's going on.- 'Okay, call back.' - Sir, what's it? The expenses went overboard at the banquet. The money I was expecting didn't come to me either. I borrowed from them on interest. I couldn't repay it yet. When can you repay the amount? It will at least take three months. I see. Okay. I have the money that I saved for my sister's wedding. I'll give that for now and adjust. - Arivu... Sir, it's okay. - No, Arivu... No... - It's okay. Sir, these people shouldn't come here, it will ruin your reputation. I'll speak to them. Please be seated. Hello... Who are you to interfere? Let him speak. Did you borrow the money? Didn't he borrow it from us? - Hey! You carry on. I am his colleague. I owe him some money. He can pay you only if I pay him. And why do you sound as if you're threatening? Hope you know it is illegal to lend money on interest. Do you know where you are talking? - Do you mean, you won't pay up? You'll pay only if we trouble you? Did we cause any trouble? Looks like you're picking a fight. What problem did we cause?- Do you know who you are talking to? You are talking with him, without knowing his background. This is wrong. Give us one week's time. I will pay you. - Arivu, please... Give us a week. - No, sir... Just a week, sir. Please... - Sir, you be seated. One week! - Okay. - I'll see you. Okay. Come, let us go. - You have only one week's time. Why were you arguing with that man? - Please go. Who will answer our boss? What if he asks us what the problem is? Sir... Please go. Hello, uncle. - They're waiting here. Will you speak with them? Yes, sure. Hello. - Hello. When will you come? - There is a small problem here. Do we need to book such an expensive banquet? Shall we have the wedding at some temple or at the registered office? Because we'll go there one evening and vacate it the next afternoon. Is it worth spending 600,000 rupees for one day's celebration? Isn't that too expensive? In olden times, for weddings, relatives, friends and the groom's family came with their families, got together, had fun, played games, enjoyed all night chatting and the wedding used to be a grand affair. But now a days, no one attends a wedding with family. Even if they get their family, they come for formality sake, do the rituals, pose for a photo and just leave. And we have to spend 600,000 rupees for that. Think over it, please. I gave it a serious thought and arrived at this decision... - Hello. Yes, uncle? Why did she hand you the phone while I was still talking to her? What did you tell her? Her face has turned pale... We'll talk later. He is asking if we can have the wedding at some temple. You may not have any relatives. Or maybe, you don't want to maintain any relationship. But that's not the case with us. We are a very big family. He just told me on phone to have the wedding in some temple or the registered office. We cannot do that. Uncle, let us go. Let them decide on something and then call us. What you said is not wrong, the way you said it is. I'm always wrong. - You should have gone personally or sent uncle to talk about it. Instead, you spoke all philosophies over the phone. They took it wrong. You have coffee. Things will be sorted if we go ahead with the banquet. That cannot be ignored. Will the banquet owner give it to us for free? Or can we have the wedding without informing anyone? This is a practice that cannot be changed now. Uncle, did we book a banquet in olden times? They either had it in some temple or in the biggest house in the village. One week back, all close relatives and friends came home, divided all the wedding related work like preparing sweets, savories, and had a gala time together. No one even bothered to check who slept where. They played different games sitting in different corners. A marriage should be celebrated. The wealthy people who do not know what to do with all their money book lavish banquets. That's how the practice started. Don't tell anything to her. - You too. Uncle, what's the matter? Why does he look angry? He isn't angry, he is in a good mood. Uncle, did you all book a banquet? We've seen two banquets. We were discussing which one of those to book. Athira, take your coffee and go inside. You shouldn't interfere while elders are talking. Go. Arivu... Don't think too much. We need to live with the current trends. Say okay for the banquet and proceed with other arrangements. How many days will you take to deliver if I order now? Once you approve the proof, we'll deliver in three days from then. Will you deliver in just 3 days? Yes. - Superb! When will you place the order? I haven't found a girl yet. Once I find one, I'll come to play my order. Do you know any girl? Aren't you the driver who came with them? You continue your work if you do not know any girl. Even if I speak royally, they still understand I am a driver. I dress up so aptly. Isn't that nice? - This card is nice. - Look here. Lord Murugan's picture is not there on this one. Oh, I... Mister, can you show me a gold card with Lord Ganesha's picture in the front? Get the LED card with Lord Ganesha's picture on it. Here... We have so many Ganesha idols at home. Why on the card? - Here. I need to say something important. We worship Lord Murugan. So, we want Lord Murugan's picture on the front side. Show us the ones with Lord Murugan's picture. Get the signature card with Murugan's picture on it. Sir, here's Murugan. Lord Muruga, bless us all. He is all decked up... Is that all? So what? We can have Lord Murugan in the front and Ganesh in the back. Do you have a card with both their pictures printed on it? Yes, we do. - Listen... Lord Ganesha is the one worshipped first and you'll keep in the back? Well... We'll decide about the God later. First, tell me the price of the card. The one with Lord Ganesha's picture is Rs 250. One with Lord Muruga is Rs 370. This card is for Rs 500 plus GST. You mean, Lord Murugan is costlier than Lord Ganesha. And to add to it, they have GST too. Sir, how many cards will you need? I think... Won't we need around 2000 cards? - That's right. What?! 2000? - Yes. Singapatti Zamin to Singapore, we have so many relatives. Okay. Uncle, what about our family? - How is this design? In the last page... They said 2000, we should not go lesser than 1500. Why do we need so many? - Explain to him. Say as your uncle says. What will we do with 1500 cards? No... - You are joining hands with him. Okay, let me close it at 500. We'll need 1500 cards. Yes, we have relatives in Natarasumootai to Norway. We need to invite them all too. I see. Sir, give me a calculator please. Get me a calculator. 2000 cards for you and 1500 for us. What is the practice you follow in your family? Will you send the card by post or go and invite personally? No, we need to go and invite personally. Zamin family, after all. It's about our prestige. I was wondering that too. You will need 2000 cards and we need 1500. Total, we need 3500 cards. One card costs Rs 270 on an average. So, 3500 multiplied by 270 comes to 945,000 which is the cost of only cards. Besides this cost are the expenses of distributing the cards. You will spend on car, diesel, traveling, food. We'll incur the same expenses too which will total to another 300,000. So, only on invitation cards, we'll be spending around 1.2 million rupees. And when you give this to someone, he will take it from you, take a look at it and then say, 'Oh, the wedding is in Selva Mahal banquet hall.' 'When is it? On 11th, Sunday. Very good.' 'What time? Morning 7 to 9 AM.' 'Okay, I'll be there.' Saying that, he'll throw the card aside. Just for this purpose, we are spending such a bomb. Communication has changed a lot these days. Everyone uses whatsapp. Mahesh, you design and send me an invite. You send it through whtasapp to your relatives. And we'll send the same to our relatives as well. We'll save money on printing cards and also on travelling. We can sit at one place and inform everyone about the wedding schedule. Amazing idea! You are all alone. You need to care for your health. When you go personally to each house, they will give you tea, coffee and cold drinks spoiling your appetite. And then you will fall ill for the next ten days. It's a good idea. But we cannot invite everyone on whatsapp. Important people will need to be given a personal invitation. You have a point there. For that, important... For important people, isn't this enough? This is too old fashioned. It looks so auspicious. It's amazing. 'Yellow invitation that signifies auspiciousness.' 'Manonmani made a long face on seeing the card.' 'Many of us are similar too.' 'We make a long face and complain.' 'An invitation is a style of information.' 'We forgot that but Arivu remembers that.' 'He has kept that in mind.' 'Will Arivu's ideas be accepted by everyone?' 'If this continues, will this wedding take place?' Is this design okay? You seem to be very promopt. Before your brother thinks of some other plan, let us finalize it. Because, he thinks too much. But he is right too. Printing invitation is old fashioned. Not just that, spending so much money on it is useless. It is after cutting trees that paper is made. So, the more paper we save, we'll be saving the environment too. You think like my brother. Hey, this is the logic I used to convince my sister. Now, she is okay with that yellow invitation. Hey, wow! That's awesome. Ask the contractor to come. Why are they delaying it? Hello, sir. - Come in, Mr Arivu. Hello. How are you? - I am good. You wanted to meet in person. What's the matter? Tell me. My sister's wedding is fixed. There's one million outstanding of that place already. Yes... When will we get money from Lakshmi? - In ten days. Transfer it to Mr Arivu's account once we get that. I will take care of the other formalities. Venkat... You didn't go to work? What's worrying you so much that you're drinking during the day? Nothing, sir. If you don't tell me now, I will bring it to Mr Vijaykumar's... Sir... I am already depressed, sir. Don't make it worse, sir. Leave. I don't like my job. How long can one continue with a job one doesn't like? I wish to start my own business. My brother... He is an industrialist, sir. His wife's family support him so much. If I get that kind of support too, I would succeed too. You have no idea, sir. If I go home, my wife irritates me asking to buy this, that, take her out. I'm the son of rich parents, but a useless husband. That is why, I'm drinking... How long will you continue in this job? Sir, how can I answer this? I will work until I have the job. What after that? Because, you will definitely get bored of this job. Or maybe, someone talented than you comes as a competition, then you will lose your job. What will you do then? I am asking you this question now because after marriage, my sister has to live with you. Without a permanent source of income or a permanent job, she will have a problem too. So, tell me. Aren't you doing this job only to kill time? Yes, sir. My dream and wish is different. My wish has always been to have an organic farm. I love organic farming. I went to Chennai all the way for attending 'Jallikattu' competition. Only if agriculture exists can we protect cows. But no one talks about it. People have forgotten. People talk about it only if there is a problem. And then we forget about it. No one finds a permanent solution to it. People look at every problem as a news for one day or maximum, one week. I want to protect cows and use them for farming. This was my dream when I was pursuing my studies. That is the life I love to live. I have a question troubling me, sir. Do we work to live, or we live to work? Will I ever enjoy my life? This is not just my doubt, but many youngsters have this question on their mind. Sir... The diseases that haunt men are mostly because of the food we eat. Chemicals are mixed in everything. To worsen it, we have hybrid. No matter how much we earn, are we able to eat food that is healthy? No. Sir, to sell their products fighting with competition, to grow their business, the efforts that international companies put is what we see in everything as cross method hybrid. This is the main reason why agriculture doesn't work. To get the society over it, we still use the old farming practices. Without using any fertilizers available now, we use natural cowdung and other fertilizers for farming. All this was done by our ancestors. Look at them. They all had a job abroad. And they earned millions of rupees. But they had no peace of mind. They had no aim as to what they were earning so much money for. They just ran after money One day, they thought over it. Why lead a stressed life? What do we need to live? Food. But we did nothing to cultivate it. What will we do with a mere salary? When they thought all this, they resigned the next day and joined me here. Now, they're supporting me in this organic farming and are with me. The day every man grows the food he needs, our country will prosper, sir. This is nice. How is it, madam? - Very nice. Try this pink saree. It's beautiful. Shall we buy this one? How much does it cost? - Rs 40000. 40000! Madam, this is ladies section. We'll decide and buy. Ask your son to go upstairs. Why don't ladies pay the bill as well? Why do you call gents then? Okay, I will go upstairs. Call me once you are done. Okay. Buy what she likes the most. Male domination is too much in every household. That's not domination, dear. That's affection. There should be a man in every family to limit our affection. Only then will the family prosper. Wow! You are the heir of a Zamin family, after all. You look exactly like my elder brother. Will you wear this to work regularly once you are married? What... - How can I wear this to office? So when will you use it again? He will wear it during monsoon while sleeping so he doesn't feel cold. Should I wear this or not? - Don't. Does it look good? - If there's an old sarong at home, tear that and wear a small piece of it for your wedding. That is not what I meant. We're spending so much money to buy this dress. When will he use this again? Will he wear it for a friend's marriage? No, he won't. You will hang this in some corner of a wardrobe. Bugs will give birth to babies inside it. We have copied all this style from the Western countries. We have no brain of our own. Who has no brains? Who are you talking about? Do you mean, the groom and his family are fools? Sir... - You stay quiet. Do we look like fools or nincompoops? I didn't mean that. What else did you mean? What did you mean? Mind your tongue. Isn't this nice? - Very nice. Well... Is your brother too stingy? No. Do you love your brother or my brother, the most? Your brother, of course. But only after marriage. Now, I like my brother the most. We had a driver who was as lean as a pole. He wore a stylish coat and suit for his wedding. What's wrong if my child wants to wear that dress? Please forgive me. I won't utter a word more, until the wedding. Okay? You better keep your word. What is it? - Modi coat, 3 shirts, 3 trousers. What for? You told me you'd buy new clothes for me for his wedding. I will slap you! Keep these back from wherever you took them. I see. So, no salary hike and no clothes as well. Right? Absolutely right. Go! Why do you own a Honda City then? You could've come on an elephant. My child will wear that dress for his wedding reception. If you like it, you may click a photo with him, else, leave. What's wrong, uncle? Isn't this wedding taking place with everyone's consent? - Yes. Looks like, we're having a secret wedding. Will you tell me what happened? He tried this dress as he wished to wear it for the reception. But he... He is asking if he's wear it regularly to work. And he is mocking that he'd wear it to protect himself from cold. If you want this wedding to take place smoothly, some people need to talk a little less. Say that again. Sister, should I buy this or not? Why will you not buy it? If they cannot buy it for you, I will buy it. You will wear this for reception. This is the trouble in marrying someone with low standards. Who has low standards? - Brother, please... What do you mean? - Chuck it. Don't, brother. This isn't our culture. This feels foreign. Why spend Rs 30,000 - 40,000 on a one time wear? He will never use it again. Why waste money then? People with sense will agree. Oh! Are you calling us senseless then? 'Oh God! Here they go again!' Sir, you don't have to buy clothes for the groom if you can't afford it. Hello! My brother will wear this for the reception. You buy it, dear. I'll pay the bill. Ask them to pack it. I'll wait down. Sister! Unnecessary comments! She is insulting us. Sorry, sir. - You don't get tensed. 'Why is he acting strange?' 'Usually, he feels happy.' 'Very difficult to follow him.' Dear! What does this mean? We are done with shopping! Shall we leave? 'You could have said no to that dress.' 'You could have said no.' 'Hey, what is this?' 'You support your brother all the time.' 'Think about it. Will you ever wear it again?' - Dear! This is not a birthday or get together party. It is a wedding! Only if both the families cooperate with each other in consideration for others happiness it will be a joyous wedding. Our two families are meeting for the first time. It takes time to develop an understanding. Am I the one causing trouble? That dress made no sense. I feel bad to spend on useless stuff. Why do you look at it as an expense? Every penny you spend on a wedding is considered charity. For instance, the amount you pay to a decorator does not feed his family alone. There are other people working with him. All their families derive benefit too! Be it printing of invites or catering a wedding provides source of income to thousands of people. When they are happy and content our daughter and son-in-law will get all their blessings. It's not just an expense. Look at the greater good. I felt like saying this. So, I did. Mom! Your logic works perfectly for people living in luxury. It is charity. Whereas there are lot of poor and middle class families who assume these standards to be our culture and tradition and take loans to fulfill them. That's not chariy. It's just foolishness. No sacred text expects you to borrow money to spend on charity. Not at all. A middle class family need about Rs 2.5 million on a daughter's wedding. They're compelled to take loan. First they run around to get loan. Later, they slog hard to repay it. Parents take about 10 years to repay a daughter's wedding loan. What if they have 2-3 daughters? I'm sure you remember that an unplanned life will land us on streets. Sister, stop crying. Don't rekindle the past, dear. Forget about the difficult past. Don't keep harping on it. 'Let's focus on how we can make this a happy wedding.' 'The dress is the issue now.' Brother! Yes? - The groom does not want the dress. He wants to go traditional. Good! Problem solved. We can proceed to the next task. It's this simple, dear. Let the couple handle issues like these. They'll manage. We can't micromanage everything. Cancel this order and clear the case. Sir, we can't do so as the Government is involved in it. There are lot of complaints against this Company. Their factory's effluence has damaged agricultural lands. So, our department along with Government had sealed this place. Now if we cancel this order, the company can reopen. Arivu, we are clearing it on the basis of documents we have. The company reopening is not our headache. Even if they have to be stopped, let the other departments do it. The company's owner spoke to me. My issues will get sorted by clearing this file. Please understand. It's my duty to obey you. You are the signatory. Mind you! There are higher authorities, sir. We've to cancel this order. Why should we? What do you mean why? What if your order is faulty? I have personally checked this order. It can't go wrong. It is faulty. We've to cancel the order. How do we go about it? Tell me. No! There is a serious mistake here. Excuse me, sir. Yes? There are only few good men like you. If you sell out, there'll be no value for honesty anymore. A lot of poor lives are dependent on truth. Please don't betray them. It is unfair to destroy the lives of innocent and honest people for our selfish reasons, sir. I also intend to lead an honest life. But the society forces me to change my intention. Fine, Narsimhachari. You may leave. The Kerala style food served at Ramachandran's wedding was good. Inquire about the caterers. Oh! - Sir! The bride's family is here. Ask them to be seated and serve water. - Sure. He wants Kerala food. - 'I don't care...' They use coconut oil. We can't eat. - 'About charges.' Your aren't going to eat. - 'Meet me in the evening.' Why do you get excited. - 'Okay? Our guests' We've lot to discuss today. Be quiet. - 'Shouldn't find fault.' No wedding feast! - 'I'll call later.' Welcome, uncle. Hello, sir. - Hi! 'Mano!' What will you have? - Nothing. - 'I've spoken to him.' It's fine, dear. Welcome! - Greetings! Hello, madam. We were inquiring about caterers on phone. So, I couldn't attend to you immediately. It's okay, sir. Their food list was impressive. Good! Greetings, madam. Hi! Okay. Since the wedding is fixed on an auspicious day, most of the caterers are booked. Did you try for someone? It is better if we finalize caterers in advance. Uncle, it is not like our guests are starving. Even if they did, they don't stay for long at the wedding. Some refuse to eat even after requests. People eat as per their convenience. Am I correct? 'She is speaking our mind.' - So we'll get parcel of 'Sambar' rice and curd rice and distribute it to our guests. Wonderful! Brilliant! You've spoken our thoughts. Give me a handshake! Sit down. Look! We'll finalize the caterers. All you have to do is hire them. You'll bear the expenses. Don't get annoyed. Let's discuss it. You say it is our expense. How can you decide then? It is unfair. I know what you will do. So we're deciding it. If you decide to serve packs of variety rice we'll lose our honor. 'Like the food parcel determines one's honor.' What is your idea? Kindly tell us. My nephew has an idea. Hear him out. Go on! Hold on, uncle. Earlier the family hosting the wedding would personally attend to guests and serve them what they need. Our guests truly relished the meal. But that's gone out of practice now. No one attends to their guests. We hire a caterer and give them the numbers. In turn, he brings 15 people make them wear gloves and serve every item mechanically! Most of them lose appetite on seeing so much food at once and tend to waste it. At the end of the wedding, there will be lot of leftovers. It's a crime to waste food. A lot of food got wasted at our senior officer's daughter's wedding. We didn't know what to do. We had to make a lot of calls. Finally, only at 4 PM we could send the leftovers to an orphanage. Why should we waste food? But there is a way to avoid wastage of food. There are veg hotels and non-veg hotels beside our wedding hall. Uncle, what... We can distribute tokens to interested guests, while they come to greet the couple. We can have four members to exclusively attend to them. We can settle the bill for food consumed at the end of the day. This is cost effective and avoids food wastage. Hello! Stop it. We are inviting our family for the wedding and not beggars. Mind your words. I am just sharing my idea with you. It's not wrong to plan. Not at all! It's not wrong. But I don't like your plan. Nope! Let's save the trouble. It's difficult to put up a lifetime with you. Uncle, let's resolve this now. If they're being difficult now, I can't even imagine after the wedding. I have to look at these faces for next 40 years. You're being rude, madam. Calm down. Though we are at your house, we have self respect. I don't need your advice. Generally, I have no faith in men. Nor do I listen to them. This wedding will happen if you agree to our terms. If not, just send the girl. My brother loves her. We're doing this for him. So we need only your girl and not your family. Think about it and decide. Dear, please wait. You can't act in haste. Uncle, don't convince me. Our families don't match. I am okay with the girl. Ask them to get married in a temple. But I don't want their family around. If they agree, we can have this wedding. Else, just call it off. 'Wonderful!' 'Our expectations have come true.' 'So, you might have understood' 'that an intelligent person faces a lot of trouble.' 'Arivurainambi spoke the truth.' 'But the wedding was called off.' 'Do you think luxury is difficult than simplicity?' 'I don't need your advice.' 'Just send the girl. We don't need your family.' If I have to abandon my mom and loving brother to get married, I don't need this wedding. I am no good to be auctioned. We can't keep begging all the time. I decided to reject the boy and his family, as soon as they wanted me to abandon mine. Ask him to marry a girl who agrees to their terms. 'Mahesh, like I told you earlier, ' 'my mother and brother mean the world to me.' 'I am not the kind who'll abandon them to live with you.' 'It's not like we are madly in love.' 'We met, talked to each other and developed feelings.' 'So we informed our folks. But it didn't work out.' 'So please! You carry on with your life.' 'And I'll do the same.' 'All the best. No hard feelings.' 'Bye!' The wedding has to happen on the same date. Please find if there's any suitable bride in our family, uncle. We have to host a wedding that sets a benchmark for others. Let's cut all ties with their family. This is not food for you to fix or replace so easily, dear. This is life. Please be patient. Don't get annoyed. I already have regrets that you don't have a happy life. We don't need a repeat episode in our family. No need, dear. When you try to change a 5000 year old tradition, it's considered a grave sin. Not many people are forward thinking. In fact, even I followed suit. I took loan to host a grand wedding. Now I can't repay. I gave in to my wife's and daughter's request. I think it is the hopes and dreams that keep us running. You must be grateful, the groom's side consented for love marriage without making any conditions specially in today's world. What are you saying, sir? What's the use of education and experience then? When 100 people say donkey and horse are the same, why are you being different? Sure, sir. I'll talk to them. I made the decision. But I wanted to run it through you. - Okay! Thanks to my experience in this. Brother! Our earth is subject to both hot summer and torrential rains. It changes as per the weather but is never broken. You fell in love. It didn't work out. But it's not end of life. It's all for good. I feel so bad to see you like this. My friend in Bangalore has a younger sister. Quite modern. She has studied in the US. I've already spoken to my friend. See! She has even sent her sister's photo. Take a look! What's the hurry, sister? Give it some time. Let's talk to them now dear. Then you can get married at your convenience. I am not interested, sister. Please! Let me be alone. I don't want to talk to anyone. Try to understand. So you don't want any of us around? You don't even want to see us. Am I right? 'I didn't say so, sister.' - 'I have raised you from childhood.' 'I know what is good or bad for you.' 'When I say something' 'give it some thought. You'll understand.' Whereas you are admant about marrying into that miser family. Uncle, shut the door. The bride's brother does not want to adjust. When he is so calculative to spend for a wedding, how will he treat you well? Only after I considered the pros and cons, I called off your wedding. We fell in love and were almost to be married. How can I reject her now? It's wrong, sister. You don't seem to understand my point, dear. Look at me, dear. - How can you... - Don't be upset, dear. Calm down. Uncle, how do I trust that he'll take care of me? Do you think your brother will keep quiet if you are in trouble, dear? Keep quiet! You can't win by prolonging an argument. You got to be quiet to have your way. Uncle, are you instigating him to stay quiet and have his way? No, dear. You're mistaken. Stop it, uncle. - If the girl agrees, will you get us married? Answer me! I'll bring her. Look at how he talks to me. You fool, stay quiet. - He doesn't get it. Uncle! Uncle! - Come with me. Try to explain. - I'll talk to him. You come. Come on, dear. Uncle, what is this? Ask him to think. - Go! Go to your room. 'He doesn't get it.' - Get in. Why is he acting like this? Uncle, he doesn't seem to understand. What is the issue? He has to go to Bangalore. Am I right? I'll convince him to go with us. He'll be fine after he sees her. He needs sometime to get over it. Please calm down. Hey! What is the matter? We're not going to get you married as soon as you see the girl. Let's do this to make your sister happy. A lot can change in the meantime. My dear! What do you want? I want you! 'Not a chance!' Reason? We can't get married. Hey, what are you saying? My sister has chosen another bride for me in Bangalore. 'She wants me to meet this girl.' Okay! Go ahead. All the best. Hello! Why do you cut the call abruptly? Listen! Do you want to elope and get married? 'We don't need your brother or my sister.' Do you watch a lot of movies? Why? Haven't you heard of people eloping outside films? Films draw inspiration from real life. 'The hero does similar to a lot of people in real life.' I'm ready to marry you without the consent of our family. Are you ready? Not at all. 'I am not a fool.' Your lifestyle is different from ours. 'Let's end this right now.' Please think straight. Bye. Don't call me anymore. Serve here. I didn't expect this unusual twist. Dear, if everything goes as expected, God becomes a myth! Uncle, you sound like poet Kannadasan. Get to the point. You promised to get her married and called it off. How is it fair? Uncle, sister is refusing now. What can I do? Think about it, dear. When they asked her to abandon her family, she sacrificed her love for us. Don't you think we should compromise for her sake? Okay. What do I do now? You stay quiet, dear. I'll handle the issues. The person making the point is more valued than the content or approach! Do you think you are Ambedkar, uncle? Enough with sarcasm. Nephews take uncle for granted and sit on our heads. Not really, uncle. I'd slip off your head. Focus on the road, dear. They are disconnecting the call, dear. Try again. Hello! -'Sir, we've come home to meet you.' I hope your trip to Bangalore is comfortable. Yes! All of us are in a happy state. So, we are taking a jolly ride. 'What is it? Why do you keep calling?' I guess you are a little tensed. I'll wait for your return. Let's discuss in person. We'll be back tomorrow. Let's discuss. 'Bye!' Why didn't you convey the message, uncle? Should I have conveyed? I thought we'll discuss after they return. Do I call them again and inform that we are okay to do it their way? No, uncle. Chuck it. We'll discuss in person. Come along. - Sure, dear. Bye, madam. - Okay, sir. You hold such a respectable post. We didn't expect you to act like this, Mr Vijaykumar. The order you've canceled relates to an ongoing public issue. You have no black marks so far. It's quite shocking to see you involved in this. Sir, please. I know it is a big mistake. I just got my daughter married in an affluent family. If the news gets out, her life will be spoiled, sir. I am ready to serve any punishment. But please don't publish the news, sir. Please! Sorry, Mr Vijaykumar. Procedure is procedure. We can't alter it for you. 'The Coimbatore district Income Tax Inspector Mr Vijaykumar has been arrested on bribery charges.' 'Income Tax Inspector arrested for bribery charges.' 'Income Tax Inspector Vijaykumar arrested for accepting 4 millions as bribe.' Stay in the car, dear. We'll come. Dude, I am with boss. Why do you keep calling? I've come to Bangalore. I'll return in two days. Hey Angamma, boss is traveling. Are you having fun? Uncle, settle the bill. Fine. I've got a Minister's scandal video. I am forwarding it. Take a look and give me feedback. Praise Lord Siva! Glory to Lord Siva! Uncle! Brother is missing. - What? He was sitting here. Where is he? They have gone to buy something. The dubsmash Chitra 'has released a new video.' Hey Saravana! - 'You'll get famous.' Hey, come here. One minute, sir. I'll finish this call. - Cut the call. Where is my brother? He was sitting in the car, madam. He is not here. - He might have gone to answer a call. 'The number you are trying to reach is switched off.' 'Please try after sometime.' 'The number you're calling has been switched off.' He has turned his phone off. The signal is weak too. 'The number you're calling has been switched off.' Manonmani! What is it, dear? 'I'm sorry. I don't want anyone to sacrifice their life for me. Nor do I want to do it.' What does he imply? Huh? Gosh! Low balance. Oh God! Sir! Low balance. I'm going to recharge my phone. Two minutes. It's just an inquiry. Don't worry. Don't be scared. We'll handle it. Hello, sir. Yes! We are here. No! I don't know. I don't know what is happening, sir. Yeah, right. Yes. They are all here. What happened? - They're going to produce him at Court today. Don't say anything. Hey, stop crying. He'll be fine. Stop crying, dear. Your greed has brought shame to an honest man. Who is responsible for it? There's no point in crying now. Tell me. Sorry, dear. I've brought disgrace to you. God bless! Come on. Every man who lives in a hope that all his dreams will come true invariably lands in trouble. It takes a lifetime to recover from it. We should blame the basic education the flaws in it, lack of attention from Government, the Corporate concerns that dumps our world with things that are not required for a living. What can a man do then? It drives him to become a machine, a borrower, a drunkard. Nobody can help him. Praise Lord Siva. Hello! Yes! Hello! This is Arunachalam speaking, dear. Hello, uncle. How are you? Are you good? How is sister? We are all fine, dear. Are you returning home from work? Yes, uncle. Ask your uncle to call me as soon as you reach home. 'Okay, uncle.' - No! No! Ask your brother to call me. 'Sure, uncle.' - Done. She sounds calm. Absolutely no tension. She sounded so relaxed. So, I don't think she knows anything about this. She is a good girl, dear. There is nothing wrong with her. I'm not concerned with her conduct certificate. Glory to Lord Siva. Did you get any call? None of his friends or colleagues seem to know either. 'Can't you track using Whatsapp, dear?' Possible. But we can't do it. We'll need the department's help. But filing a complaint won't do good. 'True! If we file a police complaint, it will go to media.' 'Not good for future.' 'Don't worry, dear.' 'He is doing all this to scare his sister.' 'He'll return in two days.' 'Stop crying.' 'Be patient.' 'I watched the movie 96.' 'It reminded me of Autograph.' 'Autograph is different from 96.' 'How is it possible' 'to stay single for the sake of your childhood love?' 'If it is true love' 'staying single is certainly possible.' She is crying, dear. Fine. Come with me. Let her get it off her chest. We'll leave. His sister has not eaten in last two days. Brother! He is safe somewhere. Half an hour ago, he has recorded a song on duet app. Can you text him? Yes! Ask him to call me. Tell him I want to talk. Stop crying, dear. Sorry! I want you in my life. I'm unable to accept that you are not around. Please! Where are you? I want to see you. Also, my brother wants to talk to you. Can you call him? Please! I am more concerned about Mano. Her brother means the world to her. I know! She talks about her brother all the time. She lives for her brother. All of you might wonder why Mano is still unmarried and stays with us despite being old. You've been decent enough to not ask about it. I'll explain now. Manonmani is my brother and sister-in-law's first born. Mahesh was born ten years later. We had a comfortable, wealthy and a happy life. God blessed us with all good. However, my brother and sister-in-law died in an accident. The children were very young. So, I had the responsibility of raising them. Since my childhood, I was inclined towards devotion and never got married. Manonmani used to hold her brother's hand while she took him to school. She has not let go off it yet. I did find a suitable groom for her. She had only one condition for the wedding. She wanted her brother to move in with her, post wedding. The groom's family agreed to it and the wedding took place. Six months after getting married, she didn't like how her in-laws treated her brother. She spoke to her husband and told him, her brother meant the world to her. If he treated him well, she'd live with him. Else, she'd leave. When a question was raised as to who was important for her, brother or husband, she chose her brother. And came back with him home. No one from their family came to convince her. Neither did she ever go back there. Fifteen years flied. She never shed a tear for no one from her husband's family came to see her in fifteen years but is crying for her brother now. Sir... I cannot bear to see her pain. Sir... Don't cry. Don't cry. Glory to Lord Shiva. To each his own. Maybe, that's right. Sir... My nephew is very calculative for every little thing, isn't he? This family gave away everything it had without worrying about money. My sister's husband had a big factory in Tirupur. He had enough wealth. He had good revenue, a good family, two children. The family lived so happily. In that family, I joined as a driver at a very young age. I was a driver indeed, but my boss looked after me as his elder son. The madam here treated me as her own brother. I never was selfish to abandon this family as it gave me all happiness. He could not discriminate between a good or bad man. He gave away whatever anyone came and asked for. I've seen him closely. I used to ask him why doesn't he save for bad days. He said, I have the strength to work and earn. So, why should I save? I will earn. Fate! What more can I say! He had a reputation in the Tirupur market. A pride, an honor! Some people did not like it. They didn't defeat him using money. They backstabbed him... Everything was over, in just one night. Orders were cancelled. All the stock remained in warehouse. The factory had to be shut. He couldn't fire his employees. Neither was he capable of paying salary to them. The suppliers harassed him. He only wished to share his happiness with others. But in difficult times, he isolated himself. I couldn't see him sad and depressed. I tried to console him saying we'd earn it all back. But I failed to convince him. One day, he just succumbed to heart failure. I am the one who performed his final rites. Glory to Lord Shiva. Glory to Lord Shiva. A family that had enough wealth was left penniless. Everything was destroyed overnight. Small children, my sister, the family had fed me for years. How could I have abandoned them? I stayed back with them forever. We sold that house. With whatever money was left after paying off debts, we came here. I bought a car and gave it on hire. My nephew is very naive. At such a young age, he realized the worth of money and debts. He used to say, 'we shouldn't live like my father.' 'We must plan and save so that we can be free of debts.' God gave me a happiness amidst all these suferings. Arivu became an officer. Athira studied well. I am happy with this. What are you saying? Sir... I worship you. - No... You're great. - I am an ordinary man. It's just for our happiness. Elders say, God does everything for a reason. He has united kind hearts, despite all the tests. Definitely! You don't worry. This wedding will definitely take place. That is all I want. - It will. Let us make the necessary arrangements. - Sure, sir. Come. 'I'm sorry.' 'I want you in my life.' 'I cannot accept a life without you in it.' 'Please!' 'Where are you?' 'I want to see you.' Mr Mahesh... He is here to see you. Sir... 'I wish to have an organic farm.' 'I love' 'organic farming.' I had already told you about this. I love to do organic farming. I want to have a farm like this, sir. Even this was started by someone like me who had this wish. He quit his job abroad and is farming here. Madam... Madam... Please have this buttermilk at least. You are starving since four days, madam. You might faint. The day we finalized Mr Mahesh's wedding with that girl, this family lost all peace. I think the girl is unlucky. Will you stop your advice? Unlucky, is it? For the mistakes elders make, we blame a girl as unlucky and make her the scapegoat. How is the girl responsible if her brother is a miser? This is how we treat a girl who comes into a family and ruin her life. Look at me, for instance. Have I not been living here for the past fifteen years? I'm sitting idle here, without a life. Am I lucky? Tell me. Won't you be talking ill of me as well? Any family that speaks ill of a girl who comes into their family the men in that family must be worthless and incapable of doing anything. It's your foolishness. How is a newly wed bride responsible if you are not good? You go inside. Go! She is talking about luck! That girl... Madam! Sir, please come inside. You go ahead. Sir... Sorry, sister. I made a mistake. How could you leave me and go? How could you? - No! - Dear... You left me, didn't you? So, go back! - Don't hit him. Who called you back? Go away! - No, dear. Why did he come now? Get out! - Don't beat him, he made a mistake. Hold on. Why did you behave so irresponsibly? Go, appease her. Go. Sister... Sister! Sister, listen to me. Sister... Sister, listen... Sister! Sister... Sister... I have got nothing to do with you. You marry the girl you love. I have understood my limits in your life. The day you abandoned me, I understood that I mean nothing to you. No, sister. Please don't say a word. - Sister... Sorry. Sorry. Well... Why did you return now? Did that man come and talk to you? You listened to him, but not me. That's not true, sister. I did not listen to anyone. You got me wrong. I have come for you. You don't believe me, do you? Listen to this. - 'Mahesh, ' 'do you know you've made a grave mistake?' - Listen to it. 'It is not wrong to have abandoned us and left.' 'Because we know you only since eight months.' 'But your sister... Think about her.' 'She has raised you since the time you were born.' 'She is who made you what you are today.' 'You have told me that she has sacrificed her life for you.' 'How could you leave that sister of yours?' 'Isn't that a grave sin?' 'Your sister means the world to you...' You are already obeying her. After marriage... Sister... - Well done! You agreed for their marriage. - Awesome. You got it done. Uncle, I did nothing. It is you who planned this. No, dear. Don't look at me like this. Why are you putting me in trouble? Didn't you call him inside? Who? The one who brought Mahesh back home. You mean, Arivu? I forgot about him in the happiness of seeing Mahesh back. You've told him not to come again, so he is standing outside. Uncle... Call him inside. This is it. I thought you'd call him inside, but you're so thoughtful. That's like my brother's daughter. Mr Arivu... She is calling you inside, please come. We are okay with everything. Let us have the wedding. Come in. After all that has happened, let us not postpone the wedding anymore. I want my brother to get married. Let the marriage take place like you want it to be. Make arrangements. Mr Groom... Here's your watch. Wear it. Show me your hand. Hey... You don't have the habit of wearing a sarong. It might slip off. Here... Wear this belt. Wear this ring. Hey, where's your chain? Will you get ready or not? Try to understand. It won't be good if I come. Everyone will pull a long face. And then it will become a sad wedding. I want some space too. It will take some time. You go, get married and bring your girl home. I can make out that you are doing this purposely. I'm doing everything for your good. Your sister has no grudges. Everything will go smooth. If I am not coming despite you insisting me so much, don't you understand my pain? I feel defeated. My conscience is pricking me. I might end up venting out my frustration and the marriage shouldn't stop again... I am not coming. You go ahead. It will go well. Okay? Hey, Angamma... Madam... - I called you so many times. Everyone is waiting for you. Please come. Come on. Sir, madam is here. She is here. She is here. I thought so. Come, dear. You forgot to take something very important and left it at home. I came to give that to you. I tried to reach you all. But none of you attended my call. We didn't forget it, dear. We left it there so that you come. Whose plan is this? I am not the one who made the plan, this time. It's him. You have raised your brother with all your love. How can he get married without your presence? We made the plan only to bring you here. That is why, we waited till you came. Suppose, you failed to come, the marriage wouldn't have happened. We respect your affection and love. If anyone from our side has made a mistake or hurt you, we are sorry. 'We don't hail from a Zamin family.' 'We survive on a Government job.' 'If there is a temple near the banquet or inside it, ' 'we can save all this money.' 'Shall we have it in a temple or the registrar's office?' 'Do we have to spend 600,000 rupees for one day's celebration?' 'Only to print and distribute cards, ' 'we'll be spending around a million.' 'After the marriage, there is buckets of leftover food.' 'There is nothing as foolish as wasting food.' 'Those who are interested in having lunch' 'can be given a token when they greet the couple.' 'I love' 'organic farming.' 'No one understands what and why you say something.' 'Sir, I am not refusing.' 'All that I have earned or saved is for my sister.' Hey, why are you sitting here? Get up, go and sit next to Mahesh. Go, dear. Don't hesitate. Hope you don't have a problem. Why would I have a problem? Uncle, you have a seat please. Mom... Firstly, I apologize to everyone here. The wedding did not take place as per your wish. I organized it in a simple manner just as per my accord. So, you all must be upset with me. Had the wedding been a grand celebration as per your plan, the money spent on this wedding would be 3.5 million rupees. In a single day, we would've exhausted that entire money. Now, I the 3.5 million rupees is with me. This is the wedding gift I have for my sister. I have deposited the money in her name in a bank. Mahesh told me, he would love to do organic farming. I have registered a land of 25 acres near Pollachi in his name for a lease period of five years. Here's the agreement for it. If he works hard there, he can own the land in five years. If a man gets a job of his choice and a loving family to support, there won't be problems in his life. It is such problems that causes a divorce. We spend all the money and saving we have in the name of customs, practices and tradition in just one day and struggle to run a family which leads to problems between a husband and wife. That beginning is what distances them both eventually. They either lead a stressed life or they part ways in a few days after marriage. No such reason should ruin my sister's life. I behaved so stingy to curb all expenses as much as I could with this good intention. A husband's life is spent in earning enough to fulfill his wife's dreams. A wife's life becomes meaningless as she fails to understand his love and concern. Marriage is not being happy for six months. It is about being happy for the rest of the life. It is only after 50 years of age, that a husband and wife start loving each other truly. Till then, understanding between the two is very important to survive. They face many problems and challenges till they reach that age. Job, money, everything is important to overcome those problems. To show off your pride and wealth, you take a loan and spend but then you run around for finance when there is a problem. I have seen this very closely and so, arrived at this decision. Don't think your husband will do everything for you. Instead, understand what best you can do with his income and be a supportive wife. Similarly, don't get into the trap of loan to fulfill your wife's wish. Instead, explain what real life is to her and lead a hapy life as a good husband to her. Please come. Wonderful! Wonderful! I misunderstood you. Why do you... Sorry. Don't embarrass us by saying sorry. Every new experience helps us to improve ourselves. Take it that way. Well said! Golden rule explained in very few words. In the six months you spent with me, you have turned into a learned man. You are praising me. I am speaking the truth. Saravana... - Yes, sir? Can we have a group photo please? Sure, why not? How much will that cost?
