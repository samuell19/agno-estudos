Greetings, Krishna. - Greetings. She is Mr. Madhavrao's wife. Name is Inspector Krishna, Crime Branch. He was like a God, he never did anything wrong to anybody. He would never scold anybody at all. Who did it? Why did they do this? My fate! What is the Doctor's report? Sir, they said this murder might have happened between 2 to 3 AM. But for one knife stabbing on the body, there is nothing. - I see. We can't find the reason behind this murder. His wife too is unable to tell anything. Sir, I don't understand anything. What is there to understand in it. He is a good person. He was doing black marketing, illegal business.. ..and many good works he did. There is a big file on him in special branch. But your Law and Order department doesn't know it. Like how his wife is unaware.. ..he is Shankarnarayan's man.. ..in the ongoing fight between Shetty and Shankarnarayan.. ..he must have got killed. Sir, do you say Madhavrao is Shankarnarayan's man? You understood very well. I can't show my face to anybody from tomorrow. During election speeches our party said it will destroy all criminal tanks. But we are unable to do anything. - Rubbish! We are trying our best, sir. But.. - Enough, don't talk. Whatever you may say, due to the fight between Shetty and Shankarnarayan.. ..Madhavrao must have got killed, this is my suspicion. By the way, who is dealing this case? Inspector Krishna, Special Branch. - Good. Sir, I want to talk to you about his matter. You know that our department and special branch are not in good terms. It will become worse with Krishna now. - I too heard about him. We don't mind his behaviour, he works sincerely. "I can wait for any long." "Why doesn't he turn up yet?" "I wish he comes here right now." "I wish he comes here right now." "Maybe he has forgotten it completely." "I can wait for any long." "Why doesn't he turn up yet?" "He only asked me to come here today." "He only asked me to come here today." "Maybe he has forgotten it completely." "Waiting anxiously, I trust him." "Though everyone teases me, I face it alone." "I will go through this ordeal for any long." "I will go through this ordeal for any long." "Will I get my Princess?" "I can wait for any long. Why doesn't he turn up yet?" "He only asked me to come here today." "He only asked me to come here today." "Maybe he has forgotten it completely." "Boys cannot ignore single girls." "They are being chased by all, I am not exception." "I am the cynosure of all eyes." "I am the cynosure of all eyes." "Whom should I narrate my saga to?" "I can wait for any long." "Why doesn't he turn up yet?" "He only asked me to come here today." "He only asked me to come here today." "Maybe he has forgotten it completely." I will forget that you killed Madhavrao. These things happen in our business. But Shetty is crossing his limits nowadays. He thinks I am incapable if I am silent. You work for me. I will give you more money than what Shetty gives. If you say no then you cannot go out of here. Leave me! - Come on. Hurry. Come on, let's go. Try to understand me, I already promised Shetty. But I cheated him by falling for Shankarnarayan's words. Shetty will not take this matter easily. This has put my life in danger now. You don't fear, Shankarnarayan will look after everything. What will he see? Could he stop Madhavrao's death? How can he stop me? Sit. I came to you with a good mind and gave you a business offer. We came to a deal. But by cheated me by falling for Shankarnarayan's words. I never spared anybody who cheated me in my life. Sir, I will explain what happened.. - Don't fear.. You know what kind of a person I am. But it doesn't mean that I will kill anybody. I give you another chance. I came to tell the same. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. I don't know how to thank you. I tell lies sometimes. Tell me.. ..where Shankarnarayan is. - No need. Shankarnarayan.. Joker.. now law to buy law. His death is confirmed. Hello? Yes. Okay. You gave this case to Inspector Krishna. It is better to be careful. What is the problem? He is just an Inspector. - No. Not just an Inspector, he is a sincere Inspector. Sincere people are very dangerous. Moreover this new Mayor.. ..is trying to destroy us. Let's see. Why don't we get the Inspector transferred? He is a very popular man. Even if put any pressure then it will become a political issue. Excuse me. Our new building's construction papers. Where are you going, Raghav? - Home. Why do you stay so far and alone? Why don't you stay with us? I like to live alone. Is anybody arrested till now? - No. Why couldn't you arrest in spite of knowing who is behind all this? Sir, you know everything. It is not possible to arrest without a proper evidence. Moreover Shetty is a big man. - Yes, Shetty is a big man. A very big man. He owns a big spare parts company in Sanath Nagar. We know what is happening in its godown but we don't do anything. He's got a packaging factory in Patil Industrial Estate. We know what biscuits are packed there but we can't do anything. He is constructing buildings without having any registration.. ..after illegally occupying the land. Big buildings, we know that but we can't do anything. He made two lakhs donations to Police Fund last year. JP Shetty is a very big man. Very big man. Krishna, don't think that only your department is working in this case. We are talking of the practical problems that.. ..come up in taking action against Shetty. Please! We shouldn't fight between ourselves, see that work is done. Krishna, what do you say about this case? Sir, the person who committed this murder.. ..is a very important member of JP Shetty's gang. Before too he killed many people. He has got many names in special branch. Hello, sir wants to speak. Sir, Raghav is on hold. Raghav, Jagan came from Mumbai. You know the building in Jawahar Colony, right? He is there. You go there immediately, take the suitcase.. ..and directly come to the factory. Okay? Tell Ismail to send car. Did he confess? - No. Tell him to beat, he will confess. - Yes, sir. Sir, I wanted to tell you something for many days. - What is it? You don't seem to understand something. Sometimes you really go out of control. To tackle a person like Shetty this way.. Sir, listen to me. Three years back, an officer by name Giri.. ..had chased to destroy him. Suddenly one day he went missing. Shetty must have killed him for sure. So even when your department personnel die in duty.. ..you are paying homage in the name of Giri. Sir, not jokes, what I am saying is, after making good inquiry.. ..preparing a proper file it is good to face Shetty. In the meantime Shetty will die of old age. How many more files you will prepare? One in your department.. ..one in income tax department, so big files. Will you spend the entire life in preparing files? For arresting, not files.. ..courage is needed. Tell, Krishna. Move. Ramesh, this is.. Tell me. Who told you? I will ask once again. Sir, not only me, entire police force has become a joke for him. Finally you too. I feel like hanging him and everyone from his gang. What is it with you? Why do you chase Shetty every time his topic comes up? Be in control. Things don't happen if you shout. There is a procedure to implement the law. We became like this after studying books on law. Look, we too know how to deal this case. Yes, you know.. - ACP.. As far as I know, only after Inspector Krishna's coming.. ..law and order situation in the city has become little better. Krishna.. - Sir.. Do what you feel is good in this situation. But in limits. What is your plan of action now? Though he is subordinate to me, he enjoys Mayor's support completely. I can't do anything in this situation. While asking for two lakh rupees donation for Police Fund.. ..you show off as if the entire police department is in your hands. Shetty, it is not that, don't get angry unnecessarily. That matter is different. If I try more than this then Mayor will doubt me. This new Mayor has sworn to destroy you. I came to tell you to be careful. I am going, I am sorry once again. No way. Hit only on the head. Good morning. We will definitely go this time. God promise. Okay, bye. Let's see. Call me immediately if you know something. Situation is quite alarming. Raghav, are you sure that Krishna didn't see you? I am too far, but I cannot say. So we cannot take chance. Moreover Krishna will chase us with full force. Why don't we kill him too? - No. This is not the correct time. Entire police department is feeling the tremors. We shouldn't do anything now. We should solve this problem only at high level. Raghav, you go to some other place.. ..until this matter becomes normal. "Oh myna!" "I heard your singing." "Wherever you are, I will come with you." "You sang beautiful songs, at least come now." "I asked the branches and searched everywhere, you are not seen at all." "I came for you, I brought you company. Where is my heart lost?" "I sang beautiful songs, at least come now." "I asked the branches and searched everywhere, you are not seen at all." "Had anyone seen anytime?" "The suffering of the heart." "This juvenility melt like clouds and fell like rain." "Every star rose in the sky and shone brightly." "This juvenility melt like clouds and fell like rain." "Every star rose in the sky and shone brightly." "In the blue sky and blue sea.." "I sang beautiful songs, at least come now." "I asked the branches and searched everywhere, you are not seen at all." "Have you wished for me?" "Get me, the feast lies in front of your eyes." "Oh butterfly, run behind it and see the entire forest." "Since you know every nook and corner, so wander around happily." "Oh butterfly, run behind it and see the entire forest." "Since you know every nook and corner, so wander around happily." "Should I come like a ray of light in here?" "I sang beautiful songs, at least come now." "I asked the branches and searched everywhere, you are not seen at all." "I came for you, I brought you company. Where is my heart lost?" Hi! Where were you? I have been waiting for you since one hour, you know. I have to carry your file too. You keep jumping upon seeing birds. - Sorry, sorry. You want room or cottage? Cottage! From May 2 to 10. Okay, confirmed! Welcome, sir. What can I do for you? I want a room. - Are you a Telugu person? I am too a Telugu person. Are you sure as how a Telugu person came here? I failed in 7th standard. - I want single room. Father will definitely remove my skin. That's why I got frightened and escaped. Poor fellow! How will he know.. ..that illiterate guy is better than literate guy. - What's the advance? 1000 bucks. Hello. - Hello. Did you see the birds? - Keys please. Why do you show so much interest on birds at such a young age? Waste! What will a bird have? Two legs, two wings. Feathers are of different colour, that's it. How to cook chicken biryani, how to cook mutton curry.. ..how to give birth to children, let these things. At least your would-be husband will be happy. Sir, why are they chasing the birds without having work? What is this study related to birds? Will they live with birds? Sir, should I send room service? Big plans in the night for leaving early morning.. Nobody wakes up on time. She slept again. - Sunaina! Sunaina! Get up, we are late. Birds are seen only in the morning. Nothing to lose if they are not seen. I can't wake up in this cold. We came to do project work.. ..not to sleep. - Project? Crap! I can't study the different behaviour of birds. You only fly with birds, spare me. Your fate! Nobody can make you good. Hey, you got injured. Hey! It looks silly but after it happened.. ..I am afraid of you more than them. Is it necessary to beat so badly? Since I beat like that so they will never do that again in life. Are they kids to ignore them? This is also a point. Have you come on a holiday here? Yes. - Alone? Everyone has their own wish. I don't like to stay alone at all. What's your name? Shekar. This is that place. Moreover he is untraceable. Do you think he knows anything about our Raghav? We can't say, sir. - Okay, you do one thing. I want this person. Hello! Didn't you sleep yet? No. There is some dance program outside. Shall we go? I don't like such things. You need to find what they are before saying you don't like them. You will get bored of yourself if you sit alone for long. Anyway, sorry for being pushy. Come. We heard that local tribal dance is very nice. We missed last time too. - Where are your friends? They are sitting in the room and talking rubbish? You want them to come? Then what are you doing here? - We are students of Ornithology Institute. Ornithology? - Study of birds is called Ornithology Hi! Hello, this is Jojo from Kenya. - Hi! Hi. Are you here for honeymoon? Are you on a honeymoon here? I don't know Kenya language. He talks English. He is asking whether you both are on honeymoon here. Oh no! We are just friends. Is this English? - No, no, this is Kenya's language. Wow! What a music! Where did they get such good instruments from? Tape-recorder? We came here after hearing that traditional music and dance here is good. Tourist traffic is more here. They got used to western music due to their influence. If you want traditional music, no problem. You want slow dance or fast dance? - Fast. "If it is cold, then go find someone." "If you are turned on, then go for it." "Will you observe keenly or walkaway?" "Will you sweep me off the floor or remain like this?" "If it is cold, then go find someone." "If you are turned on, then go for it." "You didn't sleep with the fear of darkness at night." "You got to search for in the light of stars." "You didn't sleep with the fear of darkness at night." "You got to search for in the light of stars." 'You can't smile with a heavy heart." "This lamp won't give light if covered with a veil." "If it is cold, then go find someone." "If you are turned on, then go for it." "Will you observe keenly or walkaway?" "Will you sweep me off the floor or remain like this?" "What are you dreaming for in this deserted place?" "Where does this journey end, in the direction of sky?" "What are you dreaming for in this deserted place?" "Where does this journey end, in the direction of sky?" "Break free from all the dreams and watch with naked eyes." "Don't go into exile, my company is invaluable." "If it is cold, then go find someone." "If you are turned on, then go for it." "Will you observe keenly or walkaway?" "Will you sweep me off the floor or remain like this?" "If it is cold.." 'Nayakudu' song, right? Ilayaraja. That's the last movie I watched with my father. He is no more. I really miss him so much. Your parents? Passed away? Don't know. Where were you till now? I was talking to Shekar. I think new friend has got closer. Nothing like that. Yes. I like him. Selena, you know.. ..how well he plays mouth organ? - Is it? Tell me. Tell me. Where you kept the money? You are too young but you already started. Tell me. Tell the truth. If you don't know that then I will kill you. He was roaming on streets.. ..we showed pity and brought him home, gave good and also taught work. We used to give some money every month. But he committed theft in our house. He won't listen with words. Speak up. Speak up! - Sir, sir.. Where did you hide the money? Speak up. - I don't know, sir. Speak up! Speak up! Why do you watch like that? Will you tell or not? Speak up! This is our Bunty's work. He has got the money. - Bunty, did you take it? I took it casually. It is wrong, you shouldn't do like that. Sorry, Inspector. I caused you trouble unnecessarily. - It's okay. What are you watching? Sit in the car. Do you think I will request you? Your fate! Go! Greetings, Lawyer. - JP's bail paper. Basha! Sorry, Shetty sir. I gave you trouble. But what can I do, they are our formalities. It's okay, Inspector. We will meet again. - Okay, sir. Thank you. Why are you so late? Where were you yesterday? - What to do, Shetty? Court holiday yesterday, that's why it is late. Bar is closed? Hussein! Hussein! Greetings, sir. Why did you close the bar? - How will I close it for you? Sit. - Okay. - Bring drinks. Do you have cigarettes? - No, sir. I will get them. Raghav! Raghav, how are you? How's the work? Raghav.. Go to Narayan shop and bring a cigarette packet for sir. "With only you.." Are you scared? Had I not killed him then they would have killed me. This game is to save ourselves. Let anything happen or not in life.. ..it is important to live. Remember this one thing. Will you work for me? Okay, sir. Bye. Why are you in a hurry, Inspector? He will have tea and come back. Look, he is there. I had seen this boy somewhere. He is from Police Station, he now stays with me. Raghav! He is boy, don't mind. Let's go. You are short tempered, it is good. But don't waste the anger for no reason. Use it only to achieve something in life. You know the weight of Ostrich? 150 kgs. It's height is 12 feet. Shekar, I hope I am not making you bore. I torture my mother and brother in the house by talking of birds. That's why my brother calls me bird. Why are you watching like that? I was not aware the people show interest on such things too. Well, everyone has their own interest. What do you do? Other than saving girls from danger. I am a sales officer in a company. Sales Officer? Shekar, the other day when you fought with rowdies.. ..I felt that you don't know what fear us. You have no fear at all. Is it? Fear grips a person when he thinks he loses something of his own. Life, money, it could be anything. But I don't give any importance to anything from them. It has become very heavy. I don't take anything seriously. See that bird. It is spending its life very happily. Flying, roaming. I want to be like that all the time. But.. Shekar, don't you feel anytime? We create problems by ourselves and then suffer. We will then feel sad. Right? My God! I am too talking philosophy. "Your smile told me.." "..who am I and what I am." "Your shadow showed me.." "..the void in all these years." "Your smile told me.." "..who am I and what I am." "Your shadow showed me.." "..the void in all these years." "Your hands that are spread for me.." "..I read my yesterday in them." "Your hands that are spread for me.." "..I read my yesterday in them." "The steps you took with me.." "I had seen our future in it." "A life which has nobody to share with.." "..is very heavy." "The walk that has not company.." "..is very tiring." "In your dark eyes.." "..show me the dawn." "In your dark eyes.." "..show me the dawn." "The night without moonlight.." "..is a nightmare." "On my lips.." "..a smile like you is born." "Your shy will bring the first.." "..ray of hope to my life." "The day when this life.." "..becomes double burdensome." "The day when this life.." "..becomes double burdensome." When you feel like dividing.. "..body and heart equally." "This is the auspicious moment.." ''..to get a complete.." "..new lease of life.." ..with new bondage." "Your smile told me.." "..who am I and what I am." "Your shadow showed me.." "..the void in all these years." Shekar.. I told you that day, you remember? I don't take anything seriously. When I met you.. ..you were just another friend for me. That's it. I really used to love your company. But now, somewhere.. ..without my knowledge.. ..I fell in love. But Shekar, since then.. ..there is some unknown fear inside me. I don't understand what it is. Maybe.. ..you shouldn't go away from me anytime. I love you, Shekar. Hey, hey, where? I will thrash you. - Sir, I don't know anything. I will thrash you. - Sir, I don't know. - Tell me! Tell me! I really don't know, sir. - Where is he? I don't know. - Where is he? Tell me! Tell me! - I don't know, sir. - Stop! Inspector.. ..they are not thieves from your lockup.. ..so that they will tolerate anything you do. They are my workers. Do whatever you want to do. But in a proper way. Search. Nonsense.. Sir, nothing is found here.. - I know! Come, Inspector. I brought gold rings for you. Found something? Had I really found something here.. ..I would have been disappointed a lot, Shetty sir. I don't have any intention to send you inside so easily. I will make you cry.. ..and finish you slowly. All the best, Inspector. He is acting smart. Raghav's problem.. ..should be solved immediately. God is very bad, right? - Why? He doesn't let anything we like to stay with us for long. I want to stay here forever. But college started working, I have to submit project. I have to go at any cost. Shekar, is it not possible for you to come in real? Why do you talk as if we can't meet again? I will be back in few days. Don't lose Institute's address. What flight it is! Three hours delay. I got bored. - Okay, bye, Bhavna. I will meet at the Institute tomorrow. - Okay. - Bye. Hi brother! Keep inside. Hello! Have you come? I thought you will fly away by studying the birds. Very happy. Stop blabbering and drive. - Okay, madam. Call Raghav and tell him to come immediately. Hello. Sir, there was a call from Two Town police station just now. Mayor's killer is found. - Who told? I gave three lakhs to a person. He confessed to killing Mayor's killing and surrendered. So the case is closed now. Anyway Inspector Krishna will not leave this matter so easily. It is good that we remain careful. Impossible, sir. It is not him. I am telling that I had seen. How can you say if for sure? You are away from him by 200 yards. There are trees in between. How did you recognize? Sir, what are you talking? Am I blind? Mr. Krishna, be in your limits. I am getting lot of complaints on you. Law and Order officials too are saying. If a dog bites some person then how can you play Shetty for it. Sir, you sit inside the room, you don't know about them. Shut up! I know very well. Listen to me carefully. You cannot touch them or their people without having proper evidence. This is an order, you can go. Hey Bhavna! - Guess what happened, it had children. - Really? So cute! Hey, don't you think it looks like yellow finch birds? Yellow finch? - Don't you remember? That day we saw those birds in white cage.. Shekar, you know something? I really missed you. "Desires are arising." "Desires are arising." "A naughty breeze of cold, a warmth feel of touch.." "Catch me, I belong to you." "Like a climber of flower.." "..juvenility rises." "A happy story continues day and night like this." "Catch me to fulfil the wish." "Desires arouse by drawing me towards you." "A happy story continues day and night like this." "Erase the bitter memories of the past." "You are the undeniable truth henceforth." "Come like a lightening in swirl." "You are the bee that won't standstill." "I will come myself, don't overlook me." "Desires are arising." "A happy story continues day and night like this." "I can't ask what and why." "This game never leaves us until we quit." "Feelings are unleashed in the warmth of gossip." "Let's become one by exchanging regards." "Let's catch each other, come." "Like a climber of flowers, juvenility arises." "A happy story continues day and night like this." Now I understood why you are late. You caught a nice bird. If you say anything against her.. ..I will kill you. Come, madam. You are maintaining the time very well. - I am sorry. We thought of going to the function, right? I forgot. Why will you remember? We don't have work. We keep waiting. Who told you to wait? You should have left, I don't want to come with you. Madam, do I like to take you along? When Uncle Pratap called up recently.. ..you uttered big dialogues saying you will definitely come. Hey, why do you fight over every matter? It's a small matter. Bhavna, you go and get ready soon. Come. You are right. Yes. Hello. - Hello. Sorry to be late, you know ladies makeup and all.. Excuse me. - In front of everyone. Sir, I had seen that girl with Raghav recently. Who? - Blue sari. What happened? - Just now.. Oh hi, how are you? - Hi Bhavna, how are you? - Fine. Brother! Brother! She is Mrs. Sharma. My brother. Didn't uncle come? Find out who she is. No aunt. Sorry, aunt. Went on tour for project, so couldn't come. I just missed it. Hi! Congratulations, Mr. Shetty. Thank you Inspector. But why? Don't you know? I can guess.. ..but it is good for you too. Case is solved without working hard. Anyways, you are great, Mr. Shetty. Somehow you become successful. But remember one thing. Time never belongs to us all the time. Some ice please. Inspector.. Did you see these ice cubes? They fall into glass.. ..make sound.. ..and give us impression as if they are solid. But what's the use, in few minutes, it becomes water. Maybe.. ..but the same water sometimes turn into storm. But Inspector.. ..the clouds required for it.. ..are in our control. Clouds are never permanent, Mr. Shetty. They come and go. I will wait for my day. Good luck Inspector. Thank you, Mr. Shetty. Once again, I wish you all the best. You? It is nothing, I was passing by so I dropped in. Andrew called up last night from America. He said he will definitely send in day after tomorrow's flight. Ashok has already said. I attended a party last night. I met Inspector Krishna there. He has become a big headache. He is interfering in every work. If anything goes wrong day after tomorrow then we will lose big money. What is the need to fear it? Work will be done. You are there. You will do it. Raghav.. ..nowadays.. ..you are going out with some girl, right? Who is she? It is my personal matter. Personal matter? Yes, personal, I don't say no. But it is.. ..linked to our business here. That girl.. ..is Inspector Krishna's sister. Raghav.. ..these things don't agree with our business. All of us will fall into danger. Anyway, for how long will you hide the truth from her? If not today then at least tomorrow she will know who you are and what you do. What will you do after that? "With the lightening inside the heart." "With the spark burning in the eyes." "The force and power to curb the imagination." "The windstorm that rips the cloud.." "The clamour that hits the mountain, the vigor that changes the direction." "With the lightening inside the heart." "With the spark burning in the eyes." "Moonlight is.." "..a deadly fire." "Moonlight is a dead fire. It is rampaging." "If you see me with fierce eyes, truth gets revealed." "Like the stars seen in the dark sky, beat the loneliness." "With the lightening inside the heart." "With the spark burning in the eyes." "By becoming a ball of fire.." "..if you surround.." "If you surround by becoming a ball of fire.." "Will the sun not melt?" "If you touch with the snow hand.." "Will not the moon evaporate?" "Will the thirst get quenched.." "..even if we drink the entire Ganges water?" "With the lightening inside the heart." "With the spark burning in the eyes." Uma, where is India Today? - It's there only. It's not here. - It must be in Bhavna's room, check. Didn't she come home yet? Don't know which bird she is chasing. Didn't sleep yet? What is this? - How did you get this? Bhavna, what is this? I told you not to touch my belongings. Answer my question. Bhavna, what is this? Hey, why do you shout like that? Bhavna, don't test my patience. Answer my question directly. What is this? Bhavna, what is this? Tell me. What are you these photos? Who is he? I met him at Hill station. He is my close friend. Friend? My God! Come on. I don't believe this. You are world's biggest idiot! Don't you dare.. - Shut up! Krishna, what happened to you? Mother, you don't talk in between. You know who he is and what he does? What should I know? He is a sales officer in a company. Sales officer? Wonderful! My dear sister, he works for JP Shetty. Company and all are bogus! Just drama! Black marketing, drugs smuggling.. ..and everything is carried out behind it you know. Give up your stupid ideas and learn to think with brain. - Hello. Got it? Why don't you talk? Krishna. - Yes, mother. - Call from office. Hello? Yes, I am Krishna speaking. Ah! Yes. Tell me. Where? In which flight? I am coming right away. Don't do anything until I come, okay? Look, now I don't have time to explain you. But remember one thing. You are my sister. I tell everything for your good. Who is he? His name is Shekar. I like him very much, mother. I wanted to tell you this since long time. But I don't understand why brother is talking like that. Who is Shetty? What is all this? - Bhavna.. Why will brother tell like that if there is nothing? After all he too is a police officer. Police behaviour is such, they suspect everyone. Mother, am I a fool not to know about a person.. ..after staying with him for so long? Bhavna, why do you get so angry? Whatever brother tells, it is for your good. He too must be mistaken. Why don't you go and ask Shekar directly? Bhavna.. I was thinking of you only. Sit. For you.. Bhavna, this is the first time I am ever.. ..giving something to someone. Why are you like that? What happened? Shekar, are you working under a person called Shetty? Yes. My brother says he does black marketing, smuggling and other business. How come you are working under such person? Bhavna.. It is true that there are rumours about Shetty and his illegal business. But I am working as a sales officer in his spare parts company. We know about police. If anybody does something wrong.. ..they suspect everyone around him. You heard it and.. - Shekar, I don't mean to say I believed it. But my brother said like that so.. Shekar, though my brother and I fight frequently.. ..I like him very much. But I should at least come and ask you when he says like that, right? Bhavna.. I love you a lot. I don't mean to say that you doubted me. Your brother.. Time to catch the flight. Bhavna.. I have some work, we will talk later. I am not giving any explanation for what happened. I am quitting this work. Are you mad? For that girl? Boss.. Don't talk anything about that girl. How to tell all this to Bhavna.. ..is my personal matter. It's none of your business. But remember one thing. If anybody comes between us.. There is nobody as bad as I am. Where is that girl? I didn't come to arrest you. I still have respect for the Law. I stopped you to tell an important matter. My sister is my life. If anything happens to her.. Sunaina! Leave me! Who are you? Sunaina! Sunaina! Leave! Type this matter urgently and get two copies. - Hello. Keep one copy with IG. Sir, call for you. - One minute. Got it? - Okay. - Go fast. Hello. Mother, tell me. Sunaina called up just now. What did you do to her? Tell me. Tell me! Raghav! Only this is left. I brought from the streets.. ..and kept you here. ..I taught you to hold the gun, I taught!
