I'll catch you! Come here. Talk to him. Hello? Yes. We are playing. Yes. Okay. I will. Okay. Come here, Aram. The other one. Bring the house down, too. But quietly. My dear? Wake up! What an omelet. Let's try and see how it turned out. Ah, yes. Come here. Want to hold it? Don't worry, they won't bite. Hold it like this. Just so. You see that? That crest? It's a crown. It's a trait that only Armenian doves have. This kind of dove helped our ancestor, Hayk, to land on top of Mount Ararat, thus giving fresh hope, a fresh chance to humanity and to the animal kingdom. In old times, the sailors found their way guided by lighthouses. -Lighthouses? -Yes. I am talking about really old times, when there were no iPhones, no cell phones, no navigation, no computers or iPads. There was nothing, you understand? And they traveled to countries very far away, exploring interesting and strange places. But, at the same time, they felt safe, certain that they would return home, and would never get lost. Come in. Wait. It's an alarm. It's very expensive. There. This is our shop. People bring their old, torn, worn out shoes, we repair them and return them to the owners. This is the central part of our shop. This is where we see our clients. Of course, all the miracles happen over there, but here, they see the results. In ancient Egypt, people carved their thoughts on the walls. Nowadays we have this nonsense. Who did this to your shop? Don't worry, we will clean it. Usually, I am not a fan of censorship. Hold this. But in this case, I will make an exception. Let's see how long you can you hold it. -Good morning, se単ora Angela. -Good morning. Meet se単ora Angela. Nice to meet you, se単or Aram. What are you drooling at now? Hey! Don't touch my pan dulce with those dirty hands. Don't use your hands, use the pincers. Let's clean it. Modern civilization, if you can call this civilization. Hold this. Now, start cleaning. Clean it well. -Are you Armenian? -Yes. You work for the old man? Sorry to interrupt your conversation, but the kid has a lot to do. Thank you for stopping by. Come again sometime. I said, come again. We will, for sure. I'll take the other one. Hello, Arsen. Greetings, Yelena. Your grandson? Yes, this is my grandson, Aram. Aram, please meet my good old friend, Yelena Hacopian. Hi. -Hello. -Hello. -Speak louder, dear. -Hello, Ms. Hacopian. Let's go. I'll make you coffee. And something for the boy, too. I am so busy today, I can't. Arsen... He doesn't talk much, does he? Takes after his mother. Yeva was a quiet child, too. Always absorbed in her thoughts. I saw that stupid writing on your shop's window. Remember what a nice neighborhood this was when we first bought these shops? Yes. Now it's very bad, everything has changed. Let me just finish my coffee before I fill my head with troubling thoughts. You men don't take anything seriously. Not always. Aram! Come here, my boy. A very troubling thought just came to my mind. I just can't decide which piece to take. My grandson's wish is my command. You take one, too. Good, what should you say? -Merci. -Not "merci", thank you. -And not to me, to the boss. -Thank you. You are welcome. Should I start, or you? You. Very well. Once there was a beautiful boy who lived in... -Bourj Hammoud. -Good. And one day, he decided to go... where? To California. Sunny beaches. And that boy was blessed with a skill that no one else had. He could sing like 20 different birds. And he sang loudly, too. Even louder than this siren. And when he sang... Thousands of sparrows would come from the forest. They would surround the boy, and with soft touches of their wings, they seemed to be kissing his face. They protected him from all the ugly things in the world. No one could attack him, or... Sleep, my boy. Good morning, Don Juanito. -Good morning. -Mila, Milagros. Loverboy is here for some pan dulce. Yes, Mama. I understand, and I am grateful for your visit, but I can't help you. For them, graffiti is just the beginning. These strangers don't respect us. I understand, and I thank you for your concern, and we Armenians should always look out for each other. As you wish. I am just concerned for your safety. You may just get lucky. Thank you for coming. Thank you very much. You're right. Armenians should always help each other. Watch each other's back. I'll think about your offer. Thank you. So much dirt in this store! Aren't you afraid they will fly away? No. I'm not. Try making them leave. Are you sure? Try. Tired, my boy? They will never fly away. The won't fly, because... there is danger. You know, hawks... hunt pigeons. Whenever there is a hawk in the sky, the pigeon will not fly. But I don't see any hawks. No, you won't, but they feel it. I was just on my way to your grandpa's. What's that in your hand? So, you like this foreign food? I don't know. Yes. I can drive. Yeah? Where did you learn? In Beirut. If you can drive in Beirut, you must be good. I'm okay. It would be easier if you could see over the dashboard. I can see. Yes. Arsen. How's it going? Wonderful, thank you. Your grandson brought you something delicious. Armenian pastry. He likes quality. Have a piece. I'm okay. Aram, why don't you wait outside. What time is it? Sleep. I have to meet a customer in the morning. Your bus money is here on the table. You finally came, lazy bones? I thought you were going to sleep all day. Why did you leave early today? What? Why did you leave early today? I had a lot to do. But why today? I had to see a client early. Who? He didn't come. Why don't you get some sweets to eat? I'm hungry. I have no money. What do you mean? I left you some on the table. Where is it? I don't want to go to the store. Really? You don't miss your lady friend? She is not my friend! I hate that store. I hate eating sweets every day. I hate this shop and this country. -I want to go home. -Why are you shouting? I am not deaf. What happened to you? Where are your shoes? I want to go home. I asked you, where are your shoes? -They stole my shoes. -What? Two guys attacked me in the alley. They stole my money and my shoes. That's why I don't want to buy sweets. -I am sorry. -It's okay. Let's not think about the shoes or the money. Let's think about which delicious pastry we will eat today. -I know who they were. -Who? They were from that house. I know them. -You've seen them before? -Yes. I know who did it. I know who did it. The important thing is that you are alive and well. Listen to me, my boy, your life is just starting. Things will happen in life that will make these shoes and money look ridiculous, you understand? Listen to me! Hi, Se単orita. Good morning. How are you? Be glad they only took the shoes. Okay, I got it. Things like that happen. You can't watch him all day long. You can't. The kid needs a family. And I am not family? No. You... You are an old man. Imagine what our life would be like if we only sang one song. We're surrounded by the same kind of trees, identical flowers, everything the same. What a boring life. Look, doesn't that mountain remind you of the one in Kirovakan? No. My feet hurt. That is because you are wearing beautiful new shoes. Why can't we go our usual way? It's shorter. We're just a street away. Besides, I like this way. These shoes are pinching my feet. Pinch them right back. I want my old shoes back. Wow, look at that. I just found out. We are a little busy right now. You didn't listen to me. This is what I was talking about. These foreigners should be forced and taught to respect us. There is nothing we can do right now. Aram, I promise not to sleep until I find out who did this. I can make sure no one crosses you again. Of course, if your grandfather agrees. You can trust me. Hello, am I disturbing you? -No. -No customers, right? -No, I am alone. -Let me show you something. What's going on here? -He is the one who broke in. -When? How? I've been looking for this snake for two days. How did you find him? How do you find a snake? What are you doing? What are you doing, Hakop? Stop! Please stop. You want to kill him? Don't do it, please! Hakop, please don't hurt him. I'll just scare him a bit and let him go. If someone offends you, come straight to Hakop, all right? You know, big sunglasses. Big sunglasses. Who are you looking for? Taron. What's Taron's last name? I don't know his last name. I only know that he wears big glasses. I'll take it to him. I have to give it to him myself. Follow me. This youngster has a special package for you. Where is Hakop? Hakop asked me to give this to you. Let me see. Yes. Hi. Did you see your new friend? -Yes. -So, what were you doing? I don't know. This and that. What do you mean, "this and that"? When your grandfather asks you a question, please answer it. Everything is okay. I said everything is okay. He can answer for himself. Hello, dear. What are you doing? I'm repairing this shoe. -May I see? -Here you are. And how do you do it? I apply black color with a brush all over the shoe and it looks new. You are doing a great job. -Really? -Yes. You know, I think that there is something you could really help me with. These pastries are from the new Armenian store, and I want you to try them. It's delicious. I'm glad you like it. I would like to tell you something, and I want you to listen to me very carefully. Your grandfather is doing a very difficult job. He hasn't been a parent for a very long time. I understand how difficult it is for you right now. But he also... lost his only daughter, just as you lost your mother. He loves you very much. So I am asking you to try to understand him. Let me see. You did a wonderful job. -You like it? -Yes, you did it very well. Look how nicely my grandson did it. If someone asks for me, I am in a long meeting. Very well, Arsen. -Okay. -Aram. This is some nice, clean work you've done. Can you show me how you did it, Aram? I'm talking to you! What is that? Let me see. One second. Would you look at that. How will I get home? Tell my grandpa that I had to go. Aram! You have to wait for your grandfather. He knows, they are my friends. I said, wait for your grandfather. ...trying to push your own agenda? Are you crazy? Look at me when I am talking to you. Or did you want them to shoot you all one by one? You and your friends will sit quietly and wait for me to tell you when to do what. Understand? I understand. Here? Yes, here. I'm not your limo service. -But we are almost there. -Stop crying. You want me to walk the rest of the way? If you're a cry baby, you can just spend your life in your grandpa's shoe repair shop, you hear me? Don't. -What are you, a sissy? -Don't. What are you, a sissy? -You want your mommy? -That's enough! Come on. How can I help you now? Forgive me. You got a problem with me? Look me in the eye, foreigner. Don't mess with me, I'll bury you. I'll string you by your ears and beat you until you forget your name, you beast. I'll pull your legs off and make you dance, you idiot. Grandma, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? What is all this smoke? Never mind, I don't want to know. I don't want to see this anymore. Okay, Grandma. Aram, come here. You see this? Yes. Take this to your house and hide it where your grandfather won't see it. -Understand? -Yes. So, my boy, how do you pass the time? What do you do with your new friends? I don't know. Just things. What things? You just roll around in that car all day, doing nothing. No, I work for him. Really? That slacker knows how to work? He has respect. Is that how he earns money? Listen, please make two or three holes right here, just to help your tired grandfather. No, I'm okay. What do you mean, no? This is very important. You know, in old times, when the sailors-- I don't want to know. What do you not want? What? I work day and night with no rest, so we can afford a decent life, and you don't want it? What do you want? I don't want to be like you. Show respect to your grandfather! Why should I respect you? Others don't respect you. Hakop! Hakop, please open the door. Hakop! Hakop! Please. Is he here? Hakop. I need to talk to you. Hold on a second. Sit down. You want to explain? What should I explain? What is this? I-- What is this gun doing in my house? -Hakop-- -So it's that freeloader, that good-for-nothing that gave it to you? Answer me! Yes. We need to return it. Where is Hakop? Shut up. Where is Hakop? Where is Hakop? -What are you doing? -Where is Hakop? -Hakop! -Hakop is here. Listen to me. I have something to say, Hakop. I'm listening. I absolutely do not care how you destroy your own miserable life. But... I will not allow you to destroy Aram's life too. I am warning you. No contact, no meetings. Otherwise, I will make your life hell. I beg you, stay away from this child. Do we understand each other? Yes, we do. That's good then. Let's go, Aram. Go ahead. Let's go, Aram. I am talking to you, Aram. You said your piece, you can leave now. There is no time, start breaking. What are you standing there for? I said, start breaking. Should I hit you? Seriously, you are not good for anything. Hakop needs you. I don't know, he just needs you. Subtitle translation by Mariam Ohanjanyan
