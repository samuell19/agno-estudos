The truth-teller the incorruptible debunker -What an honor -Yes And the newspapers have not wanted to be missed in the line of congratulations We contest your views, you're aware of that But we pay respect to your linguistic brilliance In other words you like me unreservedly Except in the essential Your Excellency, you surprise me I thought it was the wording that was the essential For you Is it really awful not to try to botch your reputation,Dr. Blumenreich? The way you formulate your courtesies Compliment my dear Excellency I congratulate My best wishes Yes, and these small bunch of flowers Oh,Your Excellency Don't worry about this They are not from me they have not caused me any expenses Of course,except the tram fare I have not had to sell any of my decorations Which, btw, would have been impossible as they were all sold a long time ago And the kind donor? Just a young man Who wanted to show his reverence He's not in the country That's why he wrote to me and instructed me to .. Yes, he sent me money too You probably guess who he is Perhaps But I still want to hear you say his name His Majesty the Emperor The Emperor A bit spooky,I think His Majesty the Emperor, as far as I know, the last emperor escaped abroad And there he died of too much Tokay wine His Excellence is listening Dr. Blumenreich You probably know who they call the emperor in these circles Yes, the long word for Hapsburg, I don't know who he is But do you think that makes things less spooky? It was very kind of you to come here today Dr Blumenreich But don't sacrifice too much of your precious time I thank you for your consideration, revered Master I will make use of your permission to leave Yes, I understand that your editorial staff is missing you I have been your opponent, von Blankenau and still is in many aspects But the time makes us more and more allies In the essential Goodbye, Your Excellency What kind of man was that? He looked a bit unfamiliar I can't remember seeing him before A Jewish socialist A socialist? In your house? Yes, publicity has its consequences, but let's talk about something else About the flowers, alas they are wonderful They are mediocre Do you remember those roses which I brought with me once a long time ago? They were from the Imperial Orangery Yes, I will never forget it Yes, time passes and you get old Yes we are -And foolish -Foolish? I have not noticed that No we don't notice it but the others they notice it Forgive me your Excellency I have something to say to Mr von Blankenau What is it? What is it,Father Ignatius? Hitler has persuaded Mussolini to let him have free rein in Austria That's the end for us The work of death begins Or the last battle, Mr. von Blankenau Comrades, when I called you down here there was one thing I had especially in mind You know how the leading men in this university have challenged us today Here in this our building they have uncovered the bust of a man which more than anyone else represents all that we deeply despise, hate and fight The Poet Excellency Herbert von Blankenau Comrades follow me It's shameful, it's cowardly Who are you? Elisabeth von Blankenau Let her go Attention This is a crime against discipline You forget that you are under the laws of war Not the Austrian but the German Every fifth man will be punished Clear the hall I'm sorry Miss von Blankenau -Have the guests left, Mitzi? -Yes Miss Where is His Excellency? I think His Excellency is down at the chapel Elisabeth Where have you been? What has happened? Forgive me Dad,but I got busy Busy? On my celebration day Was it really that magnificent? I've never been so acclaimed You'll see for yourself when we go up Honorary doctor at the University of Budapest The plaque from the Academy of Poets, flowers from the Emperor and much more And you think that's so remarkable? Not in principle Of course not But it still was like A seal for my whole life A symbol Oh, how you can stand that, Dad How you put up with your symbols Dad,there's one thing I need to discuss with you About what? I was at a meeting today -A political one -What? When did you become a politician? I have not become that, I am not They smashed your bust, Dad My bust? Now I understand, now I know which type of meeting And you've attended that? But Elisabeth,you know, it's beyond comprehension,your father Please,don't say anything, I don't want to hear You in the middle of the Nazis and full of sympathy while they crushed my bust Do you know what it is like to crush a bust? It is murder also surrogate for murder -And you have. -You're unjust, Dad Yes, I wish I was Dad,I want tell you It could have gone pretty bad for me You? How? But you don't think I just watched Without saying a word That I let it happen without a protest Elisabeth,you're scaring me The only thing that saved me was the intervention from their leader What was his name? Karbe Max Karbe I think You should never go to those people again Promise me that, Elisabeth You don't belong there Terrible things can happen to you And that Karbe And even if he played cavalier this time Who knows why he did it What he intends to do I'll make sure he's neutralized What are you going to do, Dad? I'm going to call the police -You mustn't do that -He's not duping me with his chivalry -I see through that -I don't want him to be locked up But why are you so eager,Elisabeth? What is it,dear Dad? Are you hurt? Well, now Well,there's probably no danger, it's just a scratch But what do you say now about your noble protector? He has no part in this I might overlook that they destroyed my bust That was an insignificant work of art But this I won't tolerate it Your Excellency is absolutely right Stay calm Your Excellency We will not let him go I will personally take care of this matter Yes, that was an ugly story Also happening on your birthday You can trust me, Your Excellency Good evening,Your Excellency -What is it? -Hide,I can't allow long explanations They will probably be here in a few seconds I should have called but couldn't find your phone number -It's secret -You must leave at once The police are after you, they can be here at any time How do you know that? Please stop asking, you shouldn't delay it for a moment -Do you know for sure? -Yes And you come here to warn me Yes,don't bother about it,hurry up -Seems incomprehensible that you -Don't you hear what I'm saying,hurry up They are coming -It seems you're meaning it -Yes,I beg you I still would like to know a bit more No,you can hear that later,I've got a car waiting,we can talk there Yes I'm coming Time to throw everything away The police? What are you going to do? I must open,I have to improvise the rest Are you going to shoot? Preferably not,and only if there's no other way out Mr Max Karbe That's me I know that already,the question is just a formality What an honor that you're coming personally You could have sent a subordinate It is not always possible to trust your subordinates Oh, I'm sorry I did not know that From what I understand, it's one of your comrades As you wish And now you've come to take me with you? Let go of that gun,Mr Karbe That's completely pointless Don't be too confident You'll have better use of your firearms I know exactly what I have to do Mr Karbe,don't you,considering the circumstances,live too openly here? I mean,anyone can find you in the directory Very desirable of you providing me with a safe place It seems to be needed Here is the address Don't play comedy,I can guess the address Without seeing it written I doubt it Corso 115 As far as I know,there's no prison there Anyhow,the house is under my control -Private custody? -Well Sometimes we use it for that purpose I don't fancy living there at all as you can understand You probably have to do it anyway As you can see now,I'm not prepared to do that I have prepared everything for your move Very kind of you maybe you can increase your kindness by raising your hands above your head As you wish A pleasure for me -And now? -Get away Yielding to your arguments, Mr Karbe Farewell Don't just lose that address Corso 115 Your Grace Heil Hitler Is he one of ours, Miss von Blankenau? One of the camouflaged Not even we're aware of Yes My visit has been rather unnecessary Good evening,Mr Karbe You've seen a bit too much,Miss von Blankenau That was not good You mean Oh,I see I could be dangerous What do you usually do with people who've seen a bit too much? Well,of course you don't take any personal considerations into account Don't let yourself decide well because of gratitude We're not allowed We've pledged not to do that By taking an oath Bad luck that I came here to warn you Very careless of me Don't you want to sit down,Miss von Blankenau? Why did you really come? I can't answer that Not even had time to reflect on this matter Has our movement engaged you? Do you want to be one of us? Please say you want to Not at all,Mr Karbe Then,what were your motives? Maybe I came to spy? I don't think so I know you didn't What is your first name? My first name? Why do you ask me that? Elisabeth Elisabeth -Understand -Understand -Hoffman -Yes It'll probably be as we intended Hardly when it is Kubelik who hands out the assignments Yes, he's afraid you'll surpass him,isn't it? In any case,he hasn't fallen head over heels in love with me Karbe You equip your people with paintbrushes and ensure that all Jewish windows in the center have been given the correct designation of origin Preferably with some funny addition You'll find good suggestions in our brochure You can pick this one "I'm a cursed Jewish Pig" "my wife is a sow" That's funny That's humor It is striking and the signature underneath The business owners must carry out the work themselves and if they spill a drop of red paint on the sidewalk they have to scrub the whole street If you can come up with something even more fun,feel free to do so I'm requesting another assignment Is this not enough? Frankly, no Listen,you're getting too cocksure, Karbe That's not good at all I want to make an effort That's all I have no talent for that kind of things On the contrary This is adapted to suit your talent You have been given far too difficult assignments But now there will be a change I'm just looking for you, Camp Commandant Karbe I'm glad to see you again Camp commandant? Yes in the concentration camp East 22 Boltenberg I have the appointment in there He's not good enough which idiot has.. Personal order from the Leader Was there anything else you wanted to know, Kubelik? Follow me,Karbe Compatriots the victory has been won The old kingdom no longer exists A new one will be built on its ruins Overthrow those in the criminal government pursuing only their own selfish purposes Your Excellency called? Yes,I wanted to remind you of the luggage I've already started, Your Excellency Fine, Josef Your Grace said that I would only pack what was absolutely necessary There could be difficulties at the border Among the most necessary are the decorations,aren't they? The decorations? Yes they will probably be needed There's bound to be many festivities in the foreign country As famous as you are, Yours Excellency Fame vanish Fame fades, Josef But the decorations remain Yes,you're right bring them along Your Excellency, any other wish? No, that's all But wait If a Mr Karbe were to show up I'm not accepting him Not under any circumstances I understand,Your Excellency Well Dad,you haven't come up with some better ideas Still refuses to accept Max I don't want to meet him No,I know that Perhaps you should You can't ask that of me I'm not trying to prevent your marriage Perhaps the best thing that happens In your case,at least a protection In this time That's all well and good But I don't want to meet him Out of the question Are you afraid of him? He represents to me the most disgusting thing I know Brutality, vulgarity, stupidity, single-mindedness The eternal lie of history But you don't know him I know what he represents And that's enough Yes,he is not asking for your blessing He has something important to tell you Please,you shouldn't torment me with it You're traveling tonight Yes, Elisabeth The concentration camp doesn't attract me No You're not made for martyrdom You less than anyone There has been such a change between us this last year You have started despise me a bit Haven't you? I don't know No,dear Dad,you can't believe that My little girl Dad,you know how much I've admired you Perhaps mostly your poems in your youth But everything else everything I've since written Yes It was very beautiful But something was missing And it was? You didn't have that spark of faith What is the hallmark of faith? That one can sacrifice That you are willing to suffer So this That you are willing to suffer Oh Dad Can we really sit down like this and just talk and talk While out there A conversation is also something that happens Hear Dad,do you hear? Yes,I hear everything, I hear it is disgusting Apparently a whole people is willing to sacrifice their freedom Their culture, their dignity, their tradition And suffer the meanest humiliation And to no avail With you it is the opposite The most remarkable thing is that despite how eloquently you're advocating for some thing It's never that important for you to sacrifice your life for it I'm afraid you couldn't even sacrifice your convenience You're going too far,Elisabeth Do you now understand why I love Max, Dad? Yes, maybe I understand You see, he has what you're missing, Dad He has faith Of course, his whole outlook on life can be expressed in a few slogans But for those slogans, he is prepared to die That's the difference between him and you He's busy I don't care,my mission is important He is lying in bed Then you can take me to his bedroom He has visitors -Then he attends visitors -It's not possible,Sir I mean His Excellency has left Lackey Heil Hitler Yes,this is Max,Dad I thought Josef He had a whole lot of excuses to stop me but They were easy to spot I notice that the time has become different What a revolution When you don't even respect the most transparent pretexts I have an important message, Mr von Blankenau I know you intend to leave the country Yes, with your permission You will not get my permission -You are traveling tonight -Yes, yes The border is blocked -Blocked? -No one may pass without special permission -By which authority? -By the Gestapo I'll never get that Here it is Tomorrow I wouldn't have been able to get it There are no arrest warrants against you,yet But it can't be long You are very compromised,Mr von Blankenau Yes, I suppose I should thank you It is completely unnecessary It is in my interest that you travel Oh what a sensitivity Especially since I was ordered to be camp commandant in Boltenberg I'd rather see that I didn't have your clientele Which hardly could have been avoided if you've stayed But why not? There are many concentration camps I can't expect that you would have been transported to another place just because of our family relationships In the service, a police officer has no privacy You may be aware of that Yes,I think I heard something similar But tell me if it's always that way How have you been able to obtain this permission? Obviously they want to They don't hesitate to get rid of you They have no special interest in making you into a martyr If you're gone when the big clean-up operation really is starting Better for us all If you're not gone Nothing can save you -May I tell you one thing,Captain Karbe -Please You will marry Elisabeth We have decided that Remember she's not That robust She is quite fragile and And complex Her upbringing You see You can rest assured,Mr von Blankenau This is the only thing where you and I completely agree Father Ignatius Good day Yours Excellency I'm definitely coming very inconvenient No, not at all, on the contrary, I'm very glad you came Oh,beautiful as usual, my daughter But I think a bit worried No This is my fiancé Father Ignatius,Captain Karbe Yes, I'm looking at a very important man A man who has to provide for the welfare of many people Newly appointed camp commandant in Boltenberg Well? Heil Hitler God help you young man to properly manage such an office Keep your blessing I can do without it Please enter,Father -Please -Thank you It is certainly an important matter you have -Your curiosity is elegant -Yes Curiosity, the sin of the old age Yes, you'll get that satisfied Thanks I've no secrets for you You mean,that what you forget to tell me in the confessional You're telling me with a glass of wine instead As you know, I publish a small magazine Oh you're way too modest "The Cross and Reality" is not a small magazine It is read all over the world Thanks to your participation, Mr von Blankenau Yes Now it will probably not be issued anymore Yes,I hope to get out the last issue tomorrow -Really? -Yes It is almost printed Of course, it will be immediately confiscated But One or two specimens would at least be smuggled across the border Yes, I have my own ways You know about that,Mr von Blankenau A life-threatening undertaking Of course And I don't have any illusions But frankly Could something worse happen to us than to be crucified with the head down No And it has been practiced before And you want from me? A small contribution on the first page Yes, for me it will be rather safe Because I'm traveling tonight Yes,but you are not meant to be crucified Good Heavens no No,anyhow we will be many enough What should I write? Yes, I know you are short on time Therefore,I've taken the liberty to put together a few lines in your spirit Yes,of course,it's very careless for a bungler like myself So it's just my signature you want Yes, that's just that, your signature It is worth a great deal What do you want me to sign? Yes it is very short and it goes like this "At this moment when a foreign soldatesque" "flows in over my poor homeland" "I confess before God, my people and the world" "as my firm belief that humanity's only salvation" "from the anxiety of the moment and the nameless barbarism" "is the name of the Cross, Lord help my people" "Christ's help needed" Yes,I admit that I've expressed that thought many times And in a much more distinguished formulation I don't mind repeating it But I don't know if it matters that much whether I do it or not My position is well known No,I am of a different opinion, Mr von Blankenau You are the great name of Catholicism The Church demands of you this heroic act Yes,but it's not heroic I'm going away I'm not in danger But we are taking the risk from you My dear friend The Herbert von Blankenau that the world knows is not identical with the real person He appears from your books He is invented Well Well,that's him making that gesture Yes And what he does in his world We,the simpler people will perform in the real world Yes, in that way it will still be quite fair Cheers,Father Ignatius May I ask for the paper? Thanks Please take it Do with it what you want God be with you,Herr von Blankenau With the real or the invented? With your poor immortal soul my son Goodbye Father But we'll probably never see each other again I know what awaits me Please afford a Mass for your old friend When that day comes And pray for our old kingdom In your exile Look Elisabeth,look Our people There come the banners Thank you for helping Dad Nothing can happen to him now No, Elisabeth Now nothing can happen Oh how wonderful that nothing can happen Nothing that separates us Max, I love you Oh how beautiful it is today Do you know why it is so beautiful today? No,why? Tell me,Max Can't you guess? No, I'm so stupid Tell me about it, I want to hear it from you You're the only one who knows Why is it so beautiful today? Because the Leader Is in the middle of us Are you displeased? No, certainly not, not at all Why? Your Excellency is also going on holiday? Yes,one has to think about one's health,my dear Blumenreich To Carlsbad to drink from their well? Yes,I'm allowed to say that Nothing serious I hope? No, no just a small inconvenience But it could easily get worse I imagine,you also have your ailments A congenital ailment, Herr von Blankenau And nothing can be done about it Yes,in general terms it doesn't bother me very much But As the climate is right now so Tell me Do you have an exit permit? Yes, I've my passport That's all Only that? How are you going to cross the border? Yes,I must Otherwise Pass -Now? Pass -Pass -Yes -I have no one,Sir I ask from the most humble, most submissive -Arrest him -Jude Go away you skunk Pass Next von Blankenau Next Max when did you arrive? A moment ago, directly from Boltenberg I'm only here for a couple of hours Elisabeth,I have longed for you May I not kiss you? Not now, Max,I'm so nervous I'm worried, Max I haven't heard anything from Dad Perhaps you think it's not advisable to write,which is true Could something have happened to him? -You mean at the border? -Yes Absolutely not Are you so sure about that? I know he's crossed the border And his name has been registered Elisabeth, are you not happy? I'm scared, for Dad's sake, and for yours My? Max I don't like your profession And it's so awful Why exactly should you have this awful occupation? What is it,Elisabeth? What are you looking at? Do you have Tortured someone? Not with my hands Not with your hands? But it could had occurred At your command,perhaps Oh, Max,don't you hate it? I must When I question a command It sometimes happens Then I always think Don't you also think that our Leader knows what you're feeling He also suffers and more than you He wants to create the Reich He is from his own people There isn't a ripple on the surface of the nation that will escape him Not a secret movement in the depths that he doesn't perceive Every whip that hits one of his people Also hits him And for him harder than anyone else He has probably cried out many times to the Almighty To the God of our land take this chalice from me But now he has had to empty it To the bottom Tell me Max,if Dad had not escaped If they had taken him and sent him to Boltenberg, to you And you had received orders Elisabeth Let's not talk about your father Would you have obeyed? Elisabeth Would you have obeyed? Yes Everything has become incomprehensible When I first started being fond of you Then it was just for that That your faith was so unconditional That you were so willing to sacrifice yourself conditional Everything Also the most expensive Without asking, without counting For me,that was something completely unfamiliar But that's exactly what makes me so scared But your father is gone Tell me,what has happened with Father Ignatius ? Do you know where he is? Yes, I know that Where is he? In my place Don't let him work too hard He works in the quarry Oh Max I don't know how to live Someone is coming There's someone walking out there It's Josef, I guess No, it's not Joseph, he's almost soundless No,that's not him What is it, Elisabeth? Max Go and see who it is By all means Why are you so scared? Therefore that I recognize the steps You? You,Mr von Blankenau Yes, forgive me What does this mean? Explain? It's a long story my friend -Daddy -My little girl We need to talk Both Mr von Blankenau,how do you dare? I'll explain You have crossed the border - It was not me - Was it not? No,it was a man that the police force would have given a lot to have in their hands He had no pass So I left him mine Why? Before I left, I had a conversation First with Elisabeth And then with Father Ignatius You don't mean that? It was exactly the same thing I learned from both of them That the famous Herbert von Blankenau Defender of the faith The greatest name of Catholicism was only an empty shell A deceptive appearance A gentleman without the quality of the reality I never meant that, Dad No, not Father Ignatius either But he understood my weakness and forgave it But behind his gentleness Was the irony And more than that Contempt And now all that would come to shame Do you know what I think No I think it was God Who threw me off the train What is not your pride, Herr von Blankenau? It is possible that it was also part of the game But in that case, it was a God's weapon When I then was on the platform and was completely bewildered Then I suddenly understood Now there is no turning back Now the gate has locked behind you,Herbert von Blankenau -Dad -Yes At first I felt a strange liberation Then I got scared But at the same time I understood That now there was only one way out The complete surrendering to Christ of all myself Of all my fate Where have you been these weeks? I was in the town I've been on the streets like everybody else but no one discovered me They must have been blind in the police force It was like God had enveloped me in invisibility What were you waiting for? A confirmation, Elisabeth A confirmation That Christ lives Did you get that confirmation? No,not yet But maybe I'll get it When I testified about him With other things than words The world will never hear of your testimony,Mr von Blankenau Max Don't do this,you can't Don't kill everything Hotel Metropol Max,be compassionate Request room 27, please How dare you, everything is destroyed I hate you Hello,it's Karbe, send me two men Isabel street 56, Villa Blankenau Yes,at once I want to be with you dear Dad Only with you, I hate him I hate him Mr von Blankenau,you are in custody Shall I help you with the overcoat? Where are you going? Just to take some water Get up Get up,hurry up This was nasty This is not correct Our baron,you feel sorry for him Feel pity for him,you say I feel pity for him,did I say that? But that's something I don't understand Everyone else has been screaming Why doesn't he scream ? He's probably obstinate Obstinate? With "Auntie" Katrina with the whip in her room No boy,time over being obstinate No You see,there's something else Hey you You, you know he wrote something religious I think something about Christ Something that Christ is more great than the Leader Yes,yes,yes something similar Now they want him to take back what he has written "Auntie" Katrina is usually good at that But with him it doesn't work No, he's not even screaming -It's a tough one -Hard? An Excellency,you once believed it in yourself No You see,it's something that keeps him strong something stronger than "Auntie" Katrina I think that's horrible Perhaps you're betting on the wrong horse Who is crying? It's just me You My mother was religious We had a crucifix I also confessed It's just superstition Superstition you said? Why doesn't he shout Why in the hell doesn't you scream God be praised Now he's howling anyway Sorry, how is it? Can you answer one question? Why did it take so long for you to scream? -Did I? -Certainly I don't remember But now I remember Because something happened Something that took Took up my whole attention Happened? What happened? At the same moment as the torture began Then I saw Christ He was standing over me He was very close What? I guess you're just imagining things No, Christ was in the room He was just as alive as the two of us Perhaps even more Did Christ do anything else? Did he say anything? He spoke This is what he said Now you are finally the real Herbert von Blankenau And as long as nothing was so important for you So real that you could suffer for it For so long, you were not real Even less than a shadow And you? How was Blankenau? I thought those whipping me Were Roman war knights They didn't just beat me But Christ Yes it was that It was a man he was beating The divine in the man Where this happened Not in the room where I was lying No in another country In another time I saw it Far away like the thousand darkness The eternal drama Yes but Anyway, you must have felt something My body felt it And in the end,it could not cope with it But started screaming But my soul was not there It was somewhere else And full of compassion for Christ In his loneliness And most perhaps with the poor Roman knights With their stupid Helpless eyes -Heil Hitler -Heil Hitler Tell me,that fellow Schmidt, what happened to him? According to order 8 30 this morning Well,well Perhaps a bit unnecessary What do you mean? Is there something wrong? Yes, it seems to be the wrong person Well Colonel Miss von Blankenau is here and requests a meeting What the hell am I going to tell her? She's quite acceptable,eh? That would be no reason of releasing that writer I don't think the leader Colonel In this case, I'd like to recommend a bit Restraint Life is a chain of renunciations, my dear Wolff Well Let her in To be done, Colonel Miss von Blankenau Oh, Miss von Blankenau Already finished? I hope everything went smoothly No,you've given me exaggerated hopes,Major Monk So he doesn't want to release your father? I'll be damned Well A colonel,you understand But there are other ways Outside the routine What do you mean? I could help you I could write a few lines to the commandant Your fiancé, isn't he? If you want to do me that honor And show me that confidence To come to my private address Arnoldsgatan 87 Let's say about Shortly after 11 p.m. Then we can Discuss about the details Unfortunately,I travel with the next train What a pity I was really hoping to be able to do something for your father Farewell, Miss von Blankenau If you change your mind Arnoldsgatan 87 -Heil Hitler -Heil Hitler - Lt Bergel has received his orders? -Yes, Mr. Commandant He's delayed A couple of the men are on duty outside the camp Should be here now Come in Heil Hitler Commandant, Lt Bergel with four men as ordered When I took up my post as commandant I ordered that no corporal punishment of the prisoners was to be allowed Without order And without my personal one for violence -It's right? -Yes, Commandant We can say that any other form of arbitrariness or violence is forbidden It's right?

Forgive me,Amann I was beside myself I didn't know what I said Come in Heil Hitler Commandant, there's a lady outside the gates She has a pass from the Gestapo, asks for preference Did she mention her name? Miss von Blankenau,Commandant Bring her to the reception room As ordered, Commandant Goodbye, Commandant I'll send up that powder Why are you looking for me,Elisabeth? What about Dad? Your father? Good, he's alive Alive? Yes,what more could you ask for And Father Ignatius? He is dead What did he die of? Urine poisoning Just because of that? Nothing else? Don't you hear what I'm saying? But Elisabeth I'm nervous Max, I've been in Berlin Berlin? Yes By gestapo To discuss Dad How did it go? Well,there's a letter I think they contain the detailed terms of his release This was to be given to you personally -Release? -Yes -Bring the prisoner 1438 -As ordered, Commandant Is it Dad who has got that number? Yes, that's him How is he? Except that he's alive You mustn't lie to me He has changed Very? A lot, Elisabeth Did something happen to Dad? Yes,you understand what I mean Yes, it has happened to him Come closer My little girl Dad Sit on the chair, Blankenau Doing it,Mr. Commandant That's the order of precedence Blankenau, just Blankenau with no title And then Mr Commandant Mr von Blankenau You have an opportunity to be released Released? Under certain conditions Well,that's reasonable You are expected to leave the country for a longer or shorter time or forever I understand I'm leaving the country When you are abroad you should make a public statement interviews or otherwise that you have been treated humanly in the camp I can do that with a clear conscience -Can you? -Yes I've had an easy job And the torture,Dad? Yes, what is the difference between torture and torture? The person supervised by the commandant has been human I don't think about the physical aspects but the state of mind that regulates it Who just did their duty and didn't allow any excesses Elisabeth, Captain Karbe is a decent man You are thus prepared to make that statement? Yes,I'm ready There is another condition Yes, Mr Commandant You are asked to recall what you've written about the church About a foreign soldatesque About our apostolic Austria And the salvation of the world by the cross Are you willing to do this too? These were strict requirements Are you ready to fulfill them? No, Mr Commandant, I can't betray my Savior I can not betray my faith And either my country I believe in the mission of Austria And I pray to God for its restoration No I'm staying in Boltenberg, Mr Commandant There is a post scriptum as well What does it contain? It reads as follows Should the prisoner refuse to meet these conditions then it is likely that he thinks he has the prospect of escaping It would be expected that he will seek to implement the plan within the next few hours That's madness It's an order, Elisabeth About the prisoner's immediate execution in the event of refusal No No No one can be so mean No human being can be so mean And you Obey the order No Are you not obeying? I can't,I can't stand this Help him,Elisabeth He needs you We don't belong together anymore Then you must reunite Never, Dad Come,Elisabeth I will unite you Am I not entitled to it? Who can has more justification? It's against nature, Dad Then we have to defeat the nature I don't want to I would feel dirty Don't force her,she can't No,I'll not force her It's not necessary I still know what will happen Nothing will happen Oh I see clearer than you, Elisabeth And even more far way than you,Max You forget what happens to a soldier, when he refuses to obey You'll be spared I don't know how A miracle will happen You're dreaming,Mr von Blankenau Maybe Maybe I'm dreaming Well I'm feeling a strange cheerfulness within me A fine intoxication of an airy dizziness I can see into the future I see Christ in everything A city of gold A new humanity Well now it's time to That I return to my sacks which are there Commandant -Take away the prisoner -As ordered, Commandant No, gentlemen, there's something wrong with that Karbe Monk now has the rapporteur 2122 What the hell is his name again? If only I had Monk with me Well, wait, his name is Amann Dr Amann Tell me,what's this about Slackness according to his report Bad role model Pure humanitarian But Karbe did a good job earlier? Very acceptable,it has been stated -In my reminiscence the Leader -Yes Oh, that's exactly which makes it a bit problematic But we'll find a way around it We have to give him an injection for the time being New report from 2122,Colonel Let us hear The fact is,that Karbe has been given a test Yes, Colonel, I haven't mentioned it before I can't come to you with all trivialities BTW,it happened in connection with Miss von Blankenau's visit Do you remember that? I remember that the colonel was not particularly cold towards her It was you who advised me Well for my part I'd love to What about it? In any case, I've given Karbe order to liquidate her dear father But under certain conditions The conditions have now occurred But the man is alive What? -It's a pure obstruction -Yes,it looks like that We have to investigate the matter Colonel I request to inspect Camp 2122 with all powers of attorney Granted my dear, Monk -When are you traveling? -Immediately Colonel -My gentlemen, Heil Hitler -Heil Hitler Well, Dr Amann,have I depicted your reports correctly? Perfect in all details,absolutely exhaustive, Major -But possibly -So something was missing? Or was not correct? Yes, Major Something was missing in the picture of my esteemed boss which would appear in all its perfection And that was? Captain Karbe's attack against the Leader He screamed and made a fuss but something more? He was roaring with laughter,Major Indeed That was disgusting It was something subhuman, if I may say so And how do you summarize your impressions of the commandant? Bad race,Major Typical product of the Hapsburg monarchy's conglomerate Jewish infiltration is not excluded If also not proven Sentimentality, inability to toughness A weakness for compassion Morally disintegrated in one word I'm sorry,Commandant Unfortunately,I am a slave of the truth How do you respond,Commandant? Nothing If I order you Anyhow I wouldn't do it Not in Amann's presence But alone with you,with pleasure Amann,you can wait outside I'll call you if we need you Perhaps you now you would have the kindness What do you say about this piece of portrait? Please let me answer with a counter question,Major Do you find your rapporteur credible? We'll leave him out for now Yes, I'm afraid of that Shut up over here, keep quiet Every moment of the day, I'm scared Damned you Blankenau Blankenau Stand up Attention Who were you talking to during work? Not with anyone Not with anyone in this room You're telling me a straight faced lie I didn't know that I was saying anything But sometimes I think loud It's forbidden I know I'll teach you for breaking the rules -It was not on purpose -What Have you become conceited and crazy? You have no will Whom did you talk to? Or just what you had in mind Perhaps that is not interesting for you It was completely private Private? You have nothing private Now,spit it out,whom did you talk to? If you really want to know It was with God Nowadays I'm often talking to him With God? Did you say "With God"? Listen,don't talk to anyone during working hours Neither with God nor Devil And now,come with me We'll do some exercise You and I Privately Why do you look at the clock constantly? Are you waiting for someone? Something to happen? A habit,Major Sit down, Karbe,after all we are comrades If you allow,I prefer to stand, I understand you're furious My manners,when that Amann was in, well,were not precisely collegial A bit too much the interrogation tone,wasn't it? But you see, it was all pure comedy to make him reveal himself You see, I'm not a friend of those zealous gentlemen There is always something behind it Devilry I'm waiting for your questions,Major Take it easy,we'll probably get there But don't stiff up like that And for God's sake,be human Well,you're looking at the clock again Damned What do you really have in mind? I can refrain, if it irritates you No, just go on looking,Karbe BTW you know that petite Blankenau Indeed, Major I know Miss von Blankenau Why that solemn? Oh,pardon Now I remember that you are engaged to the young lady BTW,she visited us,what was the matter? Well, we can talk about that later Please excuse me for calling her petite Blankenau That was inappropriate A real Lady, my dear Karbe What time is it, Commandant? 1 24 pm I don't know what you are planning But I advise you not to do any stupidities One Stop One Stop One Stop One Stop No,no,up with you Well,you're doing a circus act I have orders from the Commandant, Blankenau will follow me -What? -To the quarry -Come on now,Blankenau -The quarry? That's something for him He will fit in there Please,sit down Sit down Relax Your doctor is a botcher Not at all slack, Karbe On the contrary, very tense Far too tense What could it be due to? I can't answer that I'm unfamiliar with self-analysis I've never had time for that She, the petite Blankenau Me too,Miss von Blankenau,I mean Yes,I can never let go of that bachelor's tone What would I say? Yes She had a letter with her to you, didn't she? That's right, she had a letter with her If I'm not mistaken that letter contained something about her father,right? That's correct, Major Well,in a way,he was a very pleasant gentleman Sad that he would end his days in that way I don't understand that he could be so careless at his age What do you mean? He was shot during an attempt to escape Or have I dreamt it? I don't know if you have dreamed In any case, he has not been shot Strange Did you not write in a reply letter I know nothing about that Why don't you obey orders,madness Blankenau, sit down Because I want to talk to them Should I really sit? Well, that's probably best Otherwise you could fall over when you hear what it is all about Yes, thank you, thank you very much Well, we're not going to the quarry, that was just pretending In any case,we are going outside the camp May I ask where? Where are we going ? Yes, you will be free, Blankenau You should get in a car and take you across the border Yes, you don't need to know anything more Yes but That's not possible at all It's an order from the Commandant -By the Commandant? -Of course He together with Miss Blankenau have arranged everything Come on, let's go No,please,don't take it badly my friend but I can't follow you What? Are you crazy? When you have an opportunity like this Yes, but I'm thinking of the Commandant He has been ordered to shoot me during an escape attempt No, no you don't have to worry about The Commandant would never do anything like that,no question about that Yes I know, but I know he doesn't but But what about him then? Think about that I've been talking to God all this time And he has said that you must save the Commandant from this difficulty As quickly as possible And today he said Now, now is the time He said that? I don't understand what Blankenau can do about this Neither do I Really I just glimpse it But God has promised to enlighten me when the time is right Yes, I and then escape from everything Yes, yes, come on, just let's go A light there The light Yes Now I understand And the power The power You give me Are you speaking to God? Yes And he said I would come along Now I know What he wants from me Pass 1438 taking him to the quarry Let him go What is this? What the devil are you doing? Hello Yes Yes You could have saved your insults,Major Prisoner 1438 Blankenau has just been shot During an escape attempt Perhaps,you want to convince yourself The body is being taken to the mortuary Excuse me,comrade But even the devil,damned elegant When are you traveling,Major? -May I .. -No,don't bother I can cope Hoping to meet you soon,comrade Damned elegant Has Mr. Monk left? Yes Yes, my dear Karbe Your prospects,well you couldn't call them bright May I point out one thing,Dr Amann? Please I am standing -I notice that -Stand up I prefer to sit Monk is leaving today, Dr Amann Already today? Yes And without taking any actions What do you say? Without taking any actions Without taking any actions? Yes I'm still the Commandant in Boltenberg Perhaps now you'd have the kindness to stand up? Do you remember a lecture you once gave? Well,it was just for me It contained some mental hygienic views regarding the guard soldiers You said that from time to time you'd give them a little lamb to tear apart Can you remind that? Commandant You, Dr. Amann, are right now such a little lamb One man Dr Amann under arrest We have been waiting,Max I've come to realize one thing He no longer stands between us as an obstacle We must not make his death meaningless And all that has been,Elisabeth? Can you forget that? No Can you,forgive Yes For me, there is now only one way out Leaving the camp Make me invisible Be nameless Join the other invisible and nameless Take up the fight Against the evil I have served The whole world will burn, Elisabeth The whole world will fight I also want to fight By your side It's going to be a life-threatening battle, Elisabeth And bitter But in his spirit A struggle for the man And therefore mercy Merciful? Yes for the weak But hard against the hard ones Subtitles by Nostromo
