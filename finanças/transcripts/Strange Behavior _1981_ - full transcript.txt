We're leaving now, Bryan. Okay, Mom. Okay, all you cats out there. Well, it's 9:00 in Galesburg and apparently three or four of those big trees are already down on the Cullum Avenue way. I guess you could say it's real dangerous, woo, out there tonight so watch out. The college even reports some students have drowned. So for all you kids that didn't make that drowning scene, here's a song from the Pop Mechanix. Oh, shit. Pipsy? Is that you? Here, girl. Hey, Jerry! You know what it's like to dry your hair when the electricity keeps going out? Yeah, we know, Barbara. We're trying to fix it now. Well, if your boys are counting on breakfast, you better hurry it up. You just keep it hot for us now, Barbara. Well, Jerry Hendrix, I may blush. I'm awake. I swear to God I'm awake, Dad. And Donovan, call the college, will you, and tell those guys to start taking down the bleachers. This town's gonna be a mess for a couple of days, huh? Oh! Oh, shit. Yeah, here, too. Yeah, probably Paul up at Water and Power screwing big Annie again. Hey! Toss me a town, will you? I cut my lip here. Yeah. Okay, look, call Chicago and get a weather report, will you? If this thing's gonna turn into a monsoon, I want to know about it. Okay. Do you have to do that at the table? It's gotta be done. One of life's little chores, you know. It's enough to gag a maggot. You were rolling around here kinda late last night, weren't you? Had to fill out my application. Dad, I still want to go to Galesburg. Yeah, you know the old expression, I know what's best for you? Deeply. Well, you don't seem to be getting the message. But I like it here. It's our home. You like it here, you come back and live here. I want you to get away, see some things, get an education, then come back and stay. But you know I won't. No one ever does. Morning, boys. Morning, Mrs. Haskell. I don't know what's happening to this town. The electricity doesn't work, the phones don't ring. Do you know I did the Bailey house yesterday and all four of their TV sets were out. Mrs. Haskell, a guy could get a disease walking around on this floor, you know what I mean? You wouldn't know a clean house if it bit ya. Comedian. Did you know the um, Hoffmans have gone away again? They must leave those kids alone for six months out of every year. I buy the food and let me tell you, it just rots in the icebox. All those kids ever eat are Twinkies. They're just like animals. Except for young Timothy, of course. And there's an orgy there every single night. Let me tell you, one night when... Morning, Mr. McNally. See you later! Why all the books, Oliver? Oliver! Uh, just a little extra studying. The lights, please. Jesus, Mildred, answer the phone. Here. Here are your messages according their importance. Oh, great. Picked up Ralph Festerman again. Ugh, Flo is on her way. Did you call the college like I asked you to? John, the mayor's been calling. His son is missing. I need a beer, Donovan. You know, they're a little bit more than worried. They went out last night, came home late. He was gone. Who? The son, Bryan. His bed wasn't slept in, that's how they noticed. Oh, I'm sure he's all right. Now, what about the trees that are down? Garbage is taking care of that with Nelson. Have 'em out of there by noon. You got that thing cranked all the way up? Look, John, if you want that any colder, you're gonna have to buy a new one. Jesus, Donovan, I was just asking. We know you speak phonetically, Waldo, it doesn't mean you have to write that way. Cindy McDonald. Believe me, Cindy, sleeping on it didn't help. I agree with you, Tommy, that Jane Eyre is a woman with many problems, however to suggest that all she needed is a good roll in the hay is perhaps missing the point slightly. Ah, nice work, Roger. Now, here's a paper that had me completely baffled. Mr. Myerhoff. Nice work, an A. It's incredible, an A with my name on it. Well, maybe he got his mother to stay home last night and help him. Maybe I should get my mom to come down here tomorrow and beat the crap out of you. Oh, yeah, well maybe you'd like to come out later and try it, huh? Oh, no problem, Waldo, no problem. Come on, this isn't free school. Pete, Pete, can I have a word with you? Sure. Oh, yeah, right. I'll just be cooling my heels out in the hall or something. You want anything? One of these? No, thanks. Yeah, they get smaller every year. I saw Bob Cartwright yesterday. He told me that your class is doing extremely well in college applications. The problem is my best student hasn't submitted one yet. You've got to get one in soon, Pete. Don't worry about it, I'm working on it. Is there anything I can do to help? No, it's my father. He uh, he won't help me out with my application to Galesburg. He has this thing about Eastern schools. Did you know that he'd been accepted to several Ivy League schools? No. Yeah, it was a big item in our class. Why didn't he go? Well, he met your mother. Listen, I gotta go. Pete, how's he doing these days? Oh, he's fine. I gotta go, um, I'm in a hurry. Uh, don't worry about it, I'll get something in. What's up? Oliver, I need some money for that goddamn application to Galesburg fast. Yeah, you got no problem. I know where you can make lotsa money. Yeah? Yeah, no prob. Oliver, who wrote that paper for you? I did, honest to God, I swear to God. I mean, I don't know what happened. Oliver, you couldn't get an A on Sesame Street. Look! Hiya, John. How much? 19 cents. Where's the mayor? He's in the back, go on through. Hi, Randy. Hi. Listen, I hope you're not too worried about this now. I got Donovan out snooping around. You know, everybody's keeping an eye out for him. He'll turn up. Thanks, John. You and Linda didn't have a beef with him or anything, did you? No, nothing like that. He was just doing his homework when we left. Mm-hmm. Well, I'll call you about six. Look, there was something. Yeah? A bit strange, I thought. As we backed down the drive last night, there was a car parked in front. See anybody in it? I don't think so. Guess I should have looked. Don't worry about it. I'll call you about six. Okay. A clear and unnatural picture begins to form in my mind. They're gonna strap me into some chair and poke around with my gray cells, right? Would you just wait a minute and listen to me? Two sessions, two days, a hundred bucks a day. Listen, I did the first one already and look at me. You're very ugly. Very ugly, you know, the biggest question in my life is what to do with 200 dollars. But no problem, buddy, I just thought it may be a fast and easy way to make money. This view of human behavior was first put forward by John Watson in 1912. Of course, as one might expect, Mr. Watson was not a popular fellow. His impact was not felt until much later. As always, the combined forces of the Freudians and the so-called humanists had served... What is this character? - Shh. - At least temporally. The realists who were saying, "Look! "Look at the data." So, let us have a look at the data. May we set up the demonstration, please? When I was doing graduate work in Munich, about a hundred years ago, the faculty were extremely unsympathetic to what we were trying to do. Impatient staff. Is the demonstration ready? Good. Now, you will observe that this is an ordinary chicken. However, this is no ordinary professor. He's dead. They keep his lectures on tape. But as described in the Golub monograph, our little friend here can show us clearly that behavior is nothing more than the sum of the mechanical activities of our bodies. All right, now. Mr. Chicken, please raise your right leg. He's kidding, right? Shh! Raise your left leg. And now, please, turn so that you are facing the class. If anybody wishes to know more about operant conditioning, I suggest that you read the Golub monograph tonight. Excuse me, Miss Parkinson. Hello, Oliver. Hi. You ready for today's session? Yes, ma'am. Uh, remember, you told me to spread the word about the experiments to all my friends? Mm-hmm. I'd like you to meet Pete Brady. Hello. We always welcome the chance for new blood. Well, are you busy in the afternoons? No. Are you busy tomorrow afternoon? No. Good, then I'll meet you in my office at 3:00. Now, Oliver, your turn. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, see you later, Pete. Uh, Pete. Are you by any chance related to John Brady? He's my father, why? Does he know you'll be up here working with us? No, that's the idea. Okay, good. After the biggest storm that you've ever seen, we're still here making tunes and news for you today in your radio station. As the sun shines... We want to advise you to watch out for those road patches... We'll be here with these tunes to keep you happy and news... Hi, Pete. Oh, God, I was looking for that. Thanks. He sleeping? I just came by to fix him some dinner. Otherwise, I don't think he'd ever eat. When are you two getting married, anyway, huh? Oh! Well, I don't think it's gonna be this week, if you know what I mean. Pete, can I fix you something? A BLT or... No, thanks, I gotta go to a party. Oh! Well, have fun. Did you hear about the mayor's son? Been missing a whole day now. Yeah, I heard. Wow. See you later. Bye. Hey, slow down. Slow down. That's the house the Browns moved into. So what? So what? Lucy Brown gets around. She's only 13, for Christ's sakes. No problem there. Olly, you've got a very sick mind. A very sick mind. And naturally when the gross operating revenues rise above 7.8 level, we're faced with a diminishing return on our investment. I'm still waiting to hear what that means in plain, simple English. It means we gotta stop paying out so much gratis. Mr. Richards is quite right. The cost of doing business is rising. And that's the way it's gonna be. Anybody who doesn't do business officially, the boys'll have to pay for it. We're getting a smaller cut of the pie. Any beefs? Who's there? Stay there, dear. You're always hearing things. We better go back to the old ways and start breaking a few heads again. Go on, beat it. Go on. Hi, boys, you're late. Christ, Sarah, you look good. Aren't I great? This party is in honor of independence. Do you know what that means? I'm not wearing any underwear. That's... Really great, Sarah.

Yeah, she needs to be paid. It's so weird, all of this happening here, huh? How's Lucy doing? She's okay. Get your feet off my desk. What about you boys? Anything about that party I should know about? Nah, it was a pretty normal party. Except... What about you, Oliver? I don't even remember anything, you know? Why not? Well... Guess I drank too much beer, 'cause I slept through the whole thing. How'd you get home? I don't remember. Just a total blackout. You and Waldo weren't the best of friends, were you? Well, no, but... Nobody liked Waldo. Yeah, nobody did. Uh... What? You got a phone call. Well, who is it? Barbara. She says it's urgent. What is it, Barb, I'm busy up here. All right. Okay, yeah, I'll be right there. Yeah. All right, you guys try to stay out of trouble till I get to the bottom of this. Mildred! Tell Collins to get out to 17 just beyond the plant. Tell him to put some goddamn film in his camera this time. Donovan! Stay by the radio. Ah, man. Woo! You feel like going to the gym and working out? I feel like I've been in a train wreck or something. What time is it? Man, I gotta go to the laboratory. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right, that's right. They look great, Paula. I spent all last night baking and I didn't eat a single one. Have one. Maybe I should wait. No, no, it's okay, it won't bother me. I don't know how you do it. They took all the fun out of it. I just don't enjoy eating anymore. Okay. You can go on in now. Go on, have one. She used to weigh 300 pounds. A real balloon, if you know what I mean. Pete Brady. Have a seat. Can I ask you something? Sure. What are you doing here? Making some money, the same as you. No, I work out here, not back there. They kill little rabbits back there. Okay. You can go on into her office. Just follow the yellow line. I'm sorry, sir, that's restricted. They never allow us in there. Sorry to keep you waiting, Pete. Um, I'm finished in Room 5, Nagel. Well, have you been having a look around? Did you teach them all those tricks in there? I wouldn't exactly call them tricks. Hello, Jamie. How are you doing? Fine. Keep up the good work. I want a Coke and a pinball game. Well, just a minute, I'll check. That's okay, it looks like you have a sufficient amount of points. Does he live here? No, he just spends his day with us. What's wrong with him? Well, two years ago there used to be a lot wrong with him, but he was a very interesting case, quite unique, you know. He couldn't walk, he couldn't talk, he could only vaguely imitate sounds he picked up from others. He'd been tested for intelligence and scored very, very low. Naturally, his parents have taken him everywhere, but he was labeled a vegetable. Until he was brought to us. What did you do? Well, we discovered that his parents were actually encouraging his antisocial behavior, so we ignored him until he decided to do things our way. You know, it's extraordinary about parents, you know, they really should go into training. You know how they are. One minute they reward you for something and the next minute they're slapping you if you do something wrong. I mean, these people, they're just sort of amateurs. I'm not sure they should even be allowed to have children. Yeah, it's very bad. We're gonna have to go see Randy right away. And Donovan. I think you better call Chicago, we're gonna need some help on this. Did you manage to sign the papers that Mrs. Wiser gave you? Yeah. Good. Good, then we can begin. Today I'm going to make you smarter. Much, much smarter. This is a drug called PRL-B58. It works on the central part of the brain. It helps to firm up the connections. Everybody has a lot of information in their brain, they're just not in touch with it. It's harmless. Is it? Let me put it this way, Pete. With this little pill, the world will be yours for the next few days. You'll be smarter, you'll be more in control, in fact, you'll be able to do anything you want. Now, stick out your tongue. More. Hmm, nice healthy red. There. Swallow. Come on. Come on. The sooner you do, the sooner Mrs. Wiser will have your check ready. You see? Little behavior modification right there. You're doing fine. Is that it? Yes, for today. Well, perhaps we should... Perhaps we should do a little experiment. Try and repeat this word after me. Narci-phlasi-ne- eli-pillification. Narci-phlasi-n- eeli-pillification. Very good. Right on the nose. I feel good. I feel a little high, am I supposed to feel a little high? I'll see you tomorrow, Pete. Very good. Bye. Listen, Felix, I'd just as soon read the reports here. Oh, no, you should see the difference between the way Waldo was cut up as compared to Bryan. Waldo's got these classic knife wounds, probably done with a butcher knife, big kitchen knife, something like that. Bryan, on the other hand, has what appears to be surgical incisions around his eyes. It looked like they've done with a scalpel. As a matter of fact, if I didn't know better, I'd be inclined to say that they were done surgically. Anything else? Would you like to look at the wounds on Waldo? No, I don't think so. Well, it might be interesting. They're very erratic. I've gotta give this some thought. Uh, just send me the reports. Well, whatever you want. I thought you should see these yourself. Just send the reports over. I was just wondering, are you doing anything tonight? Hi. Well, I have to tell you about Tad. Now, he was a mouse, but I got sort of attached to him. Maybe it's because he had a name. I don't know, anyway, they dyed his hair, then they scraped it off. They fed him till he couldn't move, then they starved him. They castrated him. They even refrigerated him once. They cut him open twice, once to take out a pancreas, once to take out a lung. They even cut out his eye. I mean, that's incredible. That's incredible. Would you like to order now? I'll have the liver, please. No, um... We'll have the Chateaubriand, we want it rare. Um, sauteed in lots of mushrooms, lots of onion, keep the butter out, okay, we don't want any fat. You know what I mean? I'll have the liver, thank you. Just bring me a cheeseburger, okay? I feel weird, but I feel pretty great. Are you sure you're okay? Oh, I never felt better. You got great legs. How do you know? How long you been going to this school? About a year. 'Cause I'm going to be going here next year. Got a basketball scholarship. Aren't you a little small to be playing basketball? I have brains, talent, 135 pounds of twisted iron and steel. What's the matter, don't you like basketball? No, not madly. You will, honey. You will. You know, you're making me really nervous. Are you sure Parkinson didn't give you something? No, it's probably you never had dinner with a gourmet shrimp before. No. So do you have any brothers or sister? No, it's just my father and me. Well, what about your mom? She's dead. Died when I was a year old. Asthma. I'm sorry. Oh, no, no, it's been great with my father. Hey, I remember when I was a kid. My friends, they practically lived at my house. And if anybody ever did anything really horrible, they always got away with it. You see, my father is the top cop in this town. Ooh, trouble. Here we are, this is where I live. Do you live alone? This is Margie, Joanna, Carol. Get the picture? This is Pete. His dad's the top cop in town. I thought we'd all feel safer if I brought him home. Oh, that's a great idea. You wouldn't mind checking under my bed near my closet would you? Not at all. Not at all. Well, the house is clear. Why don't you lock the door, Pete? I wish we could turn back the clock, Donovan. I got a real uneasy feeling about tonight, you know? My stomach won't sit still. Now we got the medical examiner's report. He thinks we got two lunatics out there cutting people up. Where'd you get that necktie? Monkey Wards. Oh, yeah, you sure? You're slipping around again, aren't you? You got a new girl I don't know about, huh? Oh, no. You do, don't you? - No. - You old fart. Are you holding out on me again? Who the hell are you? Detective Shea, Chicago Homicide. I understand you guys need some help. Yeah, well, you could say that. We've never had anything in this town before. Probably routine for the likes of you. Kinda routine, yeah. Hey, uh, you guys got a shot of bourbon? That's a long tough drive down to this jerk town. Yeah, took Route 66 all the way. Thanks. Well, good luck. Yeah, it gets routine. We've seen plenty. Hell, back in '55 we found nine bodies in one house. Nurses. You wouldn't believe it. I tell you, there was different parts of different bodies in different rooms. You get the picture. One nurse, we couldn't find all the parts. Had to make up kind of a composite of bits and pieces missing from all the other bodies. You know, a nice little ass here, a little tit over there. It all added up. One guy did 'em all. Yeah, he's back on the street now. Oh, sure, got out of Joliet a couple of years ago. I'll be back in an hour. It's three minutes after nine and my name is Roger Maynard. The question tonight on Talkathon, what will you do if the big bomb hits Chicago tomorrow? My number is six... Leaving the boy alone in an empty house. What a mess. Timothy, I'm here. Kid never listens. Not that that's surprising. Parents been away so much. Timothy! I can make you a snack now. Never saw such bad table manners. No wonder. Parents like that. ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ Hey, Timothy. I think the least you can do is come down here and say hello to me. The things that kid makes me do. ♪ Every year the same migration ♪ ♪ Take the elevator up ♪ ♪ Now we've got lemmings on the concrete ♪ ♪ And some girl had her view spoiled by what was going on ♪ Okay, Timothy, you can't get away now. ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ I don't have to scream above that noise. Not clever enough, young fella, I know you're in there! Still the kid doesn't answer me. Timothy? Is anything wrong? Timothy? I'm coming in. Eleven years old and still leaves the water... Oh, thank God, Mildred! Where's Mr. Brady? Get him! Please, hurry. Oh, thank God, Mr. Brady! There's been the most horrible... The Hoffman boy. Yes. Yes, I will. Please. Timothy? God! Who are you? Oh, stop, please! Oh, oh! Shut up, Mildred, and listen to me. She's about 20 years old, brown hair, fat! Yeah, well, put him on, will you? Hello, Jordan, listen, get that goddamn stuff down here, will you? We're waiting for it. All right. Right. Randy, these guys are detectives from Chicago. This is Randall Morgan, our mayor. Oh, Mr. Morgan, now listen, we're gonna do everything we can. The scientific stuff is on the way down from Chicago. I don't know if it's gonna do any good. Right now all we got to go on is the description of the killer from last night. That was um, young overweight female. Look, I just hope we got enough troops to get us through tonight without an incident. That's it? Four people killed in this town and that's all you know? Randy! I'm gonna find out who did this, I swear to God. I promise you that. I know, John. I'm sorry. I just buried my boy. Where's Caroline? She comes in at four today. Name? Well, there they are, 2000 girls. May I ask what you're gonna do with them? We're going to find the fat ones. Here are the files from the college. 135 overweight girls. All right, let's get started. Pete, would you follow me, please? Well, so far I've come up with five dark-haired ones, all sharing the same dorm and I got about some eight in the psychology department and three lacrosse players. - Lacrosse? - Yeah. What's that about the psychology department? I don't know what it means. Some program called 104 or something. Let me see that. I think we should go up there right now and check this out. Oh, what a minute. We haven't even seen all the profiles yet. They been running wacko experiments up there for years, the government pays for everything. It's bullshit! Well, whatever they're doing, they've got girls that fit the description. There are four more. I feel like one of the animals. Now, I'll just strap your arms in. Do you have to? It's for your own protection. What we're going to do today is a little delicate and I need you immobile. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, I'd like to know a little more about what's going on before you start. This is a very, very exciting experiment. How did you feel after your pill yesterday? Anything strange? No, I felt pretty good, but what are we gonna do today? Could you be a little more specific, please? Well, we're going to do an experiment on the chemical reaction of the limbic system. Could you look this way, please? What are those needles for? What are you sticking me with? Yesterday we worked on your memory, today we're going to work on your motor responses. Like that chicken in the classroom? In a way, yes. No fuckin' way, lady! I'm not doing this shit. Now, Pete, just relax. Forget it, come on, please. Just relax. Please, listen, I won't tell anybody. Please. Oh, really, you won't remember a thing, really. Just let me, let me go! Pete, I... Let me go! See ya, Brenda. Bye. Can I help you? Yeah, you can get Mrs. Parkinson out here. It would help if I had a name. Brady, John Brady. Chief Brady. I'm sorry, but she won't be available for the next few hours. Let me put it to you this way, honey. You either get her down here or I go in. Now, just relax, Pete, it'll be over in no time. It'll be just like yesterday, you won't feel a thing. Excuse me, Pete. Help, somebody, help! Thank you. Brady's here to see you. I don't know, Brady. I've been working homicide for over 20 years and why you're up here looking at a bunch of pigeons and rabbits and ducks and rats beats the hell out of me. Mr. Brady. Haven't seen you in years. What can I do for you gentlemen? You been doing experiments on fat girls up here, Parkinson? We have a small student program for obesity, yes. Even some of the faculty members and their wives have joined in. It's a little informal, but it's been very successful in helping them all lose weight. Save the crap for somebody else. You got a list of the people in the program? We've heard your views on our work in the past, Mr. Brady. I won't have you maligning us again. And now, gentlemen, I presume you're here to make some inquiries about these murders in Galesburg. How can I help you? You got a list of people in the program? Well, as I said, it's very informal. But I'm sure we do, yes. Now, bring up what you've got on the weight program, would you? Thank you. Thank you. May I ask what this is for? No. Listen, Mrs. Parkinson, now we happen to know that last night's killer was a young, overweight female. Certainly not very much to go on, is it? Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I really was in the middle of something rather important. Parkinson! What the hell's this? That was left in honor of Dr. LeSange, when he died three years ago. Yeah, I know when he died, Parkinson, I want to know what it's doing here. It's not doing anything, Mr. Brady, it just happens to be there. Now, if you don't mind, I'm really very busy. Open it up. Oh, Doctor. Open it up, Parkinson. John, this is all in the past. I know you're in a great deal of pressure, we all are, but... Quit stalling and open the fucking door! Happy, Mr. Brady? Help me! Excuse me! What are you doing back here? Well, I was just taking my break. Well, just go back to work. Go on. Now, we're running very late and I wish you'd stop all this. Jesus. My pop has a permit... No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. Let me have one of those. What color would you like? Uh, pink. I know she'll love 'em. Yeah, she'll love 'em. How do you feel? Good. A little weak, maybe. Well, Pete, our work is over. Thank you for contributing to the program. I have a slight headache. It'll pass. You can collect your check from Mrs. Wiser. What time is it? Almost seven. It's funny. I don't remember falling asleep. Goodbye, Pete. I don't know why, but I've been hungry ever since I met you. Could you eat? Well, depends. I got an idea, let's go over to Steak N Shake. You can meet Barbara. All right, sure, I'd like that. Can I fix you something? You sure? I bought a new dress. Pretty? I know it's crazy, with all this going on, I just thought it might make me feel better. It's got this beautiful slip. Well. John, stop thinking about it. Doesn't do you any good. I know you think it's crazy, but it's the only way I can see it. Last couple of days I've been trying to figure it out, you know? I mean, why would anybody wanna kill Randy's boy, Jake Davis's boy? Now Frank Hoffman's. Three of the best-liked men in this town, all of them born here. Don't you see? See what? These were the guys who sided with me. LeSange is getting his revenge. Oh. Oh, John, please. You know, when I first read that he'd died, I wondered why I didn't feel happy. Relieved, vindicated, you know? And then I realized it was 'cause I just didn't believe it. I mean, I knew that he wouldn't just disappear like that without trying to get back at me. He's too... He's too evil, too smart. You know, I actually had a chance to kill him once? It was about six months after Katharine's funeral and I was alone in a room with him and I couldn't do it. John, I can't listen to you talk this way anymore. It's over. I sat here and listened to you talk this way for five years. Five years and it was hard on me. Very hard. But you started to come back. I can't go through that again. I can't watch you go away from me again. She's dead. And he's dead and the dead don't come back and take revenge, they don't. He isn't dead. What? He isn't dead. I know it. John, where are you going? John? Oh, no, Barbara's not here. No, it's just me tonight. Can I fix you anything? Yeah, I guess we'll have something. Pete, what's wrong? I don't feel so good. Pete! What's the trouble here? Are you okay? Yeah, somebody help me to the bathroom. I'm sorry. It's okay. Sorry. You okay in there? You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'll be right out. I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. I gotta go. I'll drop you off. No, I'll take you home. John? John? John? John? John? John? They buried the sumbitch in a three bedroom house. John. This is crazy. Stay out of the way, Barbara. What do you think you're going to find, John? Think you can get your fingers in there? What? Can you get your fingers in here? In there? Never mind, I'll get it with this. Just get out of the way, this thing could take your foot off. Come on, you fucker. Oh! Look at this. Who are you? I'm Caroline, Mr. Brady, I met you... Don't you kids leave this house. Pete, where is he? He's upstairs. What's going on? Dad? Tell me what's happening. You need to stay here with the girls. I'm not kidding. Don't leave the house till I get back. John, be careful! John, do you want me to call Donovan? Do you want me to call the state police? Do you want me to call anybody? Oh, God, what can I do? Barbara? What's going on, where is he going? It's... It's started all over again. Barbara, where is he going? Anyway, she found it hard to give it all up when she married your dad. She was so devoted to her work. 'Course, people in town said it was the doctor she was devoted to, but I never believed that. Anyway, they were very happy together, especially around the time you were born. But your mom wasn't the kind of woman to stay at home. So she went back to work about a year later. And that's when all that scandal started. All that whispering in town about things going on at the college and all those crazy experiments Dr. LaSange was doing with all his people. And about that time, your dad noticed some changes in your mom, too. She'd come home from work and she'd be on edge and she'd be... Upset about her work. And so she decided to quit. Well, then the last few weeks, she would stay up there late at night trying to finish her work. And one night... She didn't come home. So he went up there to find her. She was lying across her desk, all pale and unconscious and she couldn't get her breath. And later, at the hospital, we were all there, she said it was like she was drowning and like, like somebody was... Smothering her. And it took over an hour and then she died. And um... Your father just wouldn't believe the reports, you know, she had this history of asthma, but he wouldn't believe it. He always believed that there was a connection between LaSange and her death. Well, I moved away to Florida after that and got a lot of letters from your dad. He was always trying to come up with something new, but nothing ever turned up till now. I've gotta get to him. Pete, you can't help him. Nobody can help him. Pete, don't you think we should call the police? We don't need them. Look, you can't drive in that condition! Parkinson! Mr. Brady, I see you've found your way. Can you hear me all right? Yeah, I can hear you. Pete, what did they do to you up there? They're waiting What is wrong with you? You're acting so weird. Pete, stop the car, just pull over. Please sit down, Mr. Brady, I assure you there is no way out. There's no way out for you this time, sweetheart. LaSange! I know you're in there, asshole. I know you can hear me. Relax, Mr. Brady. Parkinson. You cold-hearted bitch. You remember me, don't you? I'm gonna take good care of you. I'm gonna give you the big one this time, honey. I'm gonna do these rabbits here a favor, I'm gonna blow the two of you off the fucking planet. My God, kid, what did they do to you? Oh, shit, what did they do? What did you do? Now, before we begin, Pete, I want you to take the gun from Mr. Brady. Pete. Listen. We can take 'em, we can stop 'em. Peter, don't do this. The choice is yours, Mr. Brady. Either give him the gun or shoot him. I can't stop you. I don't have a gun. The choice is yours, Mr. Brady. Pete. That a boy. Let me have it. That a boy. Well done, Pete. Now let's get him ready. Come on, guys, this isn't the night to be out playing. She looks dead. Oh my God, she's dead! Would you shut up, she's breathing for Christ's sake. Oh my God. Pete? It'll be all right. We'll take you to the infirmary, it's just down the hill. Pete. Gotta find Pete. Shh, everything'll be all right. Come on out here where I can see you. Hello, Mr. Brady. Surprised to see me? The shock. As you can see, my legs have gone, but I live on. I would give up my organs one at a time if necessary to continue my work. Since I have been buried, since I have been officially dead, I have been able to make great progress. I shoulda killed you when I had the chance. Ah, but you didn't. That's the difference between us. Your pathetic, sleepy little town. You people know nothing. You know nothing about the real world. What did you do to my kid? Quite an impressive young man. He has his mother's genes. Now, there was a woman of great intelligence and talent. I was sorry to lose her. She was so happy before she met you, so dedicated. I miss her. Sometimes. Oh, you better shut your mouth! And tonight, Pete will be the beneficiary of our years of research. My new drug. You're about to see a demonstration. A forceful demonstration, I hope, of just what it can do. It is remarkable. In time it can be used to empty out prisons, to teach backward children, to help the disturbed. Our society can be rebuilt. Pete. Don't hesitate, now, do exactly as I told you. Oh, Jesus. The other carve now. Don't do that! Oh, Jesus. LeSange, this is between you and me, this doesn't have anything to do with him! Leave him out of this! I assure you, Pete will not be harmed. I could not do that to Katharine's son. My drug will wear off in a few hours. There will be no memory, no guilt. Pete, are you ready? Pete... Kill your father. Pete, don't. Don't do it. Pete, don't. Don't do it, don't. Don't. Pete, finish up, please. Kill your father now. Pete, don't, don't, don't. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Do not stop again, kill your father. No, Pete, no! No, Pete, your father, kill your father! You are my father. Stop it! Come on, over there. Come on. Move these people back away from the rear of the car. Ah, step back, folks. Back, please. Alvin? Where the hell is that guy? We gotta go. It's late, they'll be there by now. What'll it be, guys? Congratulations, John, I heard the good news. Oh, thanks, Alvin. Uh, let me have a beer and a little taste of that bourbon. Me, too. I'll just have a beer, thanks. Do you have an ID? Alvin, this is my kid. What's the matter with you? Didn't recognize you in your suit. Dear friends, let us turn to the Lord and pray. Bye! Were you nervous? Well, it's over now. He looked great, didn't he? I just kept looking at him and thinking he looked just great. ♪ Maybe it's the winter ♪ ♪ Cold can get to you that way ♪ ♪ But you don't find and that's the symptom ♪ ♪ You just hide yourself away ♪ ♪ Waving ahead in traffic ♪ ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ ♪ Hanging in a horror film ♪ ♪ Every year the same migration ♪ ♪ Take the elevator up ♪ ♪ Now we've got lemmings on the concrete ♪ ♪ And some girl had her view spoiled ♪ ♪ But what was going on ♪ ♪ Now your clothes are worn ♪ ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ ♪ Jumping out a window ♪ ♪ Jumping out a window ♪
