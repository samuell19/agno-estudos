WE ARE LIVING THINGS Hey, Jorge called! You have to go to 502, there's an issue with the bathroom. Go take a look... - The Chinese people's apartment? - Yes. Who is it? I am here to fix the bathroom. "Translating." "Your bathroom." Where is it? It's here. I think... Shit! It's fixed. Hello... Hello... Solomon. What's going on? Didn't I tell you that we were done with that? Take that thing down! - I found a stone that when you? - No, no... I don't care. Take that thing down right now. Come on. We have a deal for you to stay here, right? If you want to stay here, do as I say. Take that thing down. Go help him. Take it all down. All of it. Ren√©, help him. Hi, how are you sir? You want a manicure or pedicure? No... I have a package for... this girl with the short hair. Oh, Chuyao, ok. Chuyao! - Yes? - Someone's here for you. He said he has something for you. Could you take it for me? Sir, she asked me to get it for her. I can take it for her. - Ok. - Yeah, thank you. You're welcome. Have a nice day. You too. I don't know your name... but I know you believe they exist and that they communicate with us. "Translating." I don't know your name... but I know you believe they exist and that they communicate with us. It's been six months now... How are you? Are you eating properly? When will you come home? I am sure your father will forgive you as long as you... stop it once and for all with your UFOs and spaceships. They're only in your head. Hi, I'm coming up. This is for you. Can I just wear what I'm wearing? Wait until you see it. Try it on. I like what I'm wearing. Just try it on. Go. They're ready. This is for you too, the latest model. It's too tight. Mr. Bo! Sorry we're late. - The traffic in New York. - Yeah, I've been waiting for you. Let me introduce, Chuyao, my niece. This is Mr. Bo. Nice to meet you Mr. Bo. - Nice to meet you! - And you all know Yao. - Go ahead and sing a song for us. - Of course. Why don't we take a seat first. And, cheers! - Thanks for coming. - Thanks for having me. Well, we have some business to discuss. You two can start to get to know each other. I like your hair. Excuse me ma'am, if I can just check your ID as well. Sure, I take it. Thank you. Thank you. If you could just look at me. For a moment. Thank you. - Check that out. - Sure. So, we're just going to take a look at it. Then hopefully we'll be done. Ma'am, if you could just stay inside. You have a back door? Yes. Officer, is everything ok? Just routine check. We're looking if there are any pending orders on anyone's ID. I think they knew I'm not your niece. Relax, white people think Chinese people all look alike. Everyone is Chinese in our nail salon, but they only took my ID to the van. If they suspected anything, they would've never let you go. Check this out, it's so tiny... I don't like the idea of this inside my body. Look, it will go in here. It's like being bitten by an ant, you won't feel a thing. It's just a precaution. If anything were to happen, I'll know where to find you. Hey, man. Put your stuff on the couch. How is everything? - Sit here. - Facing that way. Choose one, whatever you like. Ever had a piercing? Good, please lay your head on the pillow. - Hey, Tiger! - Hi! - Give me your coat. - Thank you. Which ball should I hit? - You can hit the white one first. - That one? And see if it can hit the striped ball. - Can I hit it from here? - Sure! Aim for the middle pocket. It's a private room. No bad, girl! You've played this before? Sir, do you want to try one? Now what? They all look so far. - It's your turn. - My turn. What are you guys having? You want to try? - Try what? - Let's give one to Chuyao. Take this. Now you'll definitely hit the ball into the pocket. Feeling good. It's my turn. So close! How do you like it? Let me help you. You alright? Be careful! - It's okay, it's all normal. - Lean on me, and give me the cue. Easy, it's normal for first timers. - Where is Tiger? - He's busy. Relax, take it easy. I'm taking off your clothes now. I've been calling you all day. I was so worried about you. You worried about me? Yes. Don't you always know where I am? Yes, I was monitoring you all night. I would have never let anything bad happen to you I had no idea things would go like that... Baby, I'm so sorry. I had no idea... Hello? I see, I can come tonight. On my way. Something happened. I have to go. I can drop you off at your place first, and come get you when I'm done. I thought we're gonna have dinner together. Yes. We can still do that later. Do you want to come with me? Okay. It's a memorial service. You can wait here for me. - I've seen dead people before. - You sure? Hello? OK, got it. It's time, they'll come to take him now Now? - Yes. Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. I forgot to tell the family something. Wait here for me. I'll be right back. Check this song while you're waiting. Be right back. Why are you here? I told you to wait in the car. Let's go. Where are they taking the body? Back home. Tianjin. People have some needs, and I provide a service. They want to return to the roots, like falling leaves. Is it legal in America? Legal, illegal... What's permitted over here is forbidden over there. What's illegal today becomes legal tomorrow. Welcome. Is this the real Chuyao? How is she? She's doing great. Her due date is getting close. Twins. I still don't look like her, even after changing my hair. Maybe one day I can meet her. I'd like to thank her in person. She told me when we met last time, that she's glad that someone is using her ID. There is a guy... Who? Someone is following me. What does he look like? Have I seen him? Maybe I'm just paranoid. It's fine. Don't overthink, okay? Relax. Just relax... Hi sir, how can I help you today? Hi, can't cut my nails. Sure, have a seat. I would prefer Chuyao. - Oh, Chuyao. - Chuyao. Chuyao, someone's here for you. Listen... I want you to come with me. I don't know you. Are you OK? I know, but you're in danger. Come... I need to show you something. You go away or I call police. Excuse me, sir... - What's the matter? - I don't know him. Sir, she doesn't know you. - You want me to go away? - Now! Sir, please. You're scaring her. Easy... easy... Here. Deep breath. There. Can't sleep. Let's try this. Why you follow me? I think I know you from somewhere. We can sleep now. You went to his place? You got those sounds with this? What? You got those sounds with this? Yeah. Ok. You ready? I have something! Come. Who is she? I don't know. Can you invert? - What? - Invert! I want to talk to her. Yeah, but this is not the radio, you know? Please... Let's try. Try. Try to talk. Take your stuff. Those blankets. It's ok. Come. So... you have two homes? No. it's warmer here, once it starts to get cold. What's this? Obsidiana. It's a volcanic stone. Where you find it? Mexico. Teotihuacan. The city of the Gods. You can see the sun with that. I want to go there. Who are those 3 people? What 3 people? The ones in the newspaper. One of them was my mother. She was taken by a spaceship. In the Arizona desert. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Where you gonna go now? South. South where? Arizona. You said you'd never go back there. Here it is. Never. Where do you want to go? Take my stuff. My place. Let's take a look at the GPS. Pisinemo, Arizona. With P. Pisinemo. The corpses of 14 Chinese nationals were discovered inside a meat freezer last night, after one of the alleged perpetrators of these heinous crimes was found dead in front of his house. We spoke to Mr. Wen Shao, an acquaintance of one of the victims. Some of us, especially the older generation wish to be buried with the ancestors back home in the native villages. The soul cannot rest otherwise. I have heard of people who pay a monthly fee just to ensure that their body can be sent home. Here. Shopping time. New clothes. There's a shopping mall there. But... you? I'll pay the check and I'll see you there. See you later. But the bizarre drama doesn't end there . It appears that the IDs of some of the Chinese citizens were being recycled and sold on the black market. No arrests have been made. One of the suspects is Latino, and believed to have entered this country illegally. He drives a 1988 grey Dodge Ram. He is thought to be armed and dangerous. Can I sit here? Sure. Let's go. Where is your van? It was old. Sold? Old. - But, your stuff? - It's in the back. Ok. I thought you left. I had to take care of a few things. Jump in the car, let's go. Ok. - Bye! - Bye. That guy tried to pick you up? Maybe... This is for you. And for the antenna. Far away roaming around, roaming around. For birds flying free in the sky, for brooks running blue in the mountain, for great prairie green, far away roaming around, roaming around. I got some Chinese. You stole this? I improved it. You made a hole in it. Yes, it's nice. Try it on, it's for you. Did you steal anything else? No. Am I supposed to trust you? No. What are you doing? I need to know if you have another bug. A what? A bug. The thing that he put in your neck. It's ok. Come. Here. I thought you were going to find something. With your machine. I think they put something in my body. I was taken. Tonglu, China. My hometown. Everybody thought I was crazy. My mom said never tell anyone. Next day people said... A very bright light in the sky. August 13, 2006. You're the only living thing... I ever felt connected to. My mother is out there... somewhere... I will never stop looking for her. I don't want to get you into trouble, it's not safe for you to... to be with me now. Don't go. They are all going against the wind. In 2019, there were 221 sightings around the state of Arizona It's a UFO. Last year, the navy confirmed these videos captured UFO sightings, no one knows exactly what these UFOs are. If this is true, if there is even a shard of possibility that this is true, it is the biggest scientific question that has ever confronted mankind. We should take smaller roads. Can you look at the map? There is a map inside there. We slept enough. Let's go. I was dreaming. We have to go, now. Those trees, were this small. Look at them now. We are not far. Hello? Who is that? I am looking for Constance. There's no Constance here. I'm an old friend. You're gonna have to leave. Wrong place? She is there. He was lying. Xingxing, it's mom... I dreamt of you last night. You were a little girl again. I called you but you didn't hear me I woke up, I was sweating. What are you doing? Stop contacting her! This is a waste of time! She's not our daughter anymore. Give me the phone... Please... That's her! Hey. Oh, it's been a long time. I see you're not alone. Neither are you. She is Chuyao. Nice to meet you. Darren, come on out. Make a fire, we got some guests. You're odd. Did anyone ever tell you? "Odd...?" Odd: It's unusual, it's nothing bad. Don't take it personally. She doesn't like girls. Only men. Is there a bathroom? Behind the bushes. Or there's a John inside. I'll show you. First time in Arizona? You're very pretty. You want some? No, thank you. It's good stuff. I grow it back here. It'll make you feel good. You understand English? He never slept. He was always there looking around for us, see that what we were doing. I thought you'd fallen in. She your girlfriend? You broke my heart when you left that morning. You don't do that to a woman. Actually, why are you here? We need a place to stay. Men... Are they the same in Korea? I am from China. - So why are you here? - You're gonna tell me? We came to see the place. What place? Where they take his mother. This smells horrible. What are you up to? These are some of the landing sights... There is a 9/02... that was a long time ago. 11/12/16... Nothing more recent? Well, he doesn't like me to do this, so I stopped keeping a log. This is where they took your mother, Magdalena. Remember? I showed you. And, there are these metal fragments that were scattered all over the site. All different sizes. And they sent some to a lab, and nobody could tell what it was, but I have the lab report. Here. The metallic particles reveal micro-mineral compounds that seem to pre-date the sun, and are not known to occur anywhere in our solar system. It's amazing! Put it, put it back. I am hungry. How far is that place? It's under an hour. - You saw? - What? When it happened? He didn't tell you? You tried coming across six or seven times, right? When I saw you, you didn't even speak English, you were so skinny, you had that little photograph, you'd been putting in your pocket all the time. And I came over, I said "let me see that photo." And I looked at it, I said I know that woman, that's Magdalena, she lived with me... No, no, no. I want to tell a story. - Darren, I am just... - Shut up! You guys hear that? Coyotes. Oh, come on, Darren, there are no coyotes around here. They smell pussy that's why they come. That stuff makes you crazy, I already told you that. I was just kidding. I don't know why he is acting like this. When they smell pussy they come. You ought to write a book. Why just go back inside so I can talk to these people? You know she's lying. He is not making any sense. - No, you don't make any sense. - What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me is to live here with you. Come on, let's... Telling a different story to different people. This shit gets all mixed up you can't tell whose shit is whose anymore. - You're just a liar. - I am just trying to do the best I can. You know that, Solomon. Listen, there is no Mamacita here. Someone just raped her, cut her to pieces. and made up the story of the spaceship, you know that! Shut up! Yeah, you gotta go back to your country. It ain't a free ride for you people in the US of A no more! You know that? You gotta go! Don't you fucking touch me! Darren! Enough! Enough! Enough! You stop it! No! There is no more of this! - You got away with it, fucking gringo. - Put that down, put it down! What's going on? Look at me. What's going on? Let's go. Let's sleep here tonight. It smells like my father. Solomon, it's pulling. I don't know if it's in my head. Come.
