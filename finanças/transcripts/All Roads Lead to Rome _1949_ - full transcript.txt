On board the liner 'Valparaiso' sailing from South America... ...a serious event has occurred. Important confidential documents... ...belonging to the ambassador of a foreign power... ...that we will not name, had disappeared. The police are notified. The press is alerted. Mady Broque, investigative reporter for 'Lumiere du Soir'... Your evening paper! ...together with her colleagues. No. No Madam... On the left. That's it. I'm scared... Leave me alone! An interview never killed anyone. Tell us something about this theft of documents. Documents? What documents? Come now... try harder... There aren't any documents? Nice little documents? That's no good... I believe that... Oh, I lost them. I lost my documents! I don't know where they are or what they were about. I've forgotten everything. I always forget everything, you see. Oh, my documents! But they were very important. Lets go. He's a nice man, but she's wasting her time. - So? - He's all yours. A woman had spent the whole trip in her luxury suite. No one knows who she is. She alone received permission to leave the ship... ...before the end of the investigation. Enjoy your freedom. Phone me every day. Too late, madam. Too late. What was she doing on that ship? Hello... Who's this? Why it's Edgar! Yes. Edgar, another reporter. Not very talented. Not very sharp. Were the documents found? There are indeed documents. She found better ones. - Where are we going? - Hunting. The game is ahead. The journalists pursue the beautiful stranger... ...who is none other than Laura Lee... ...the famous star coming back from Hollywood. During this time... ...a talented young mathematician... ...had given up preparations for a trip... ...and forgotten his studies... ...to devote himself to a curious pastime. Gabriel Pegase, surveyor. Big lover of detective novels, adventure stories and mysteries. Gabriel! Hermine, his sister. Quick-tempered, but genuinely dedicated. It's mathematically impossible to commit suicide that way. Kill yourself some other time. Come and help me. Where are your lecture notes? Lecture notes? - I left them on the desk. - Without me, you'd forget them. Go get them... hurry up! We should've left already. Well, my friend, hurry up. You know your sister wants to leave today... ...and you're going a long way. So big! Gabriel, it's a big day! The first time that we saw the sea. Put on your scarf. - But, Ermine... - The sea breeze is treacherous. I don't like those American cars. It's just showing off. What cars? Show me your fist. The other... The right one's bigger. Watch out! What would you like? Well... Hello yes? The Hotel Crillon? Hello? Don't cut me off. I'm connecting to Paris. The menu. - Coffee? - Never. I've a sensitive heart. Hello? Yes. Everything is perfect. Did you do what was necessary? It's rude to listen, Gabriel. For October? I hope we'll reach the border tonight. I'm talking to you. I say that... Thank you. No no no! I do not want to die that way. Poison is stupid. I want an original death. No! I agreed to die to please them... ...but it makes sense that I choose my death. Fix it, Kate. I want these last days to be trouble-free. Marvellous! A real detective story. But it's awful! How? Are they following me? No, I've seen nothing. It's awful, Kate... They'll catch up with me! A man and a woman? I'll leave immediately. She's being followed. As soon as I'm across the border, I'll call you. Goodbye. She's wearing pants! You know her? Gabriel, you know women and I don't know about it? Who dress like men? Are you hiding things from me? Are you're lying to me? To me? I won't be angry. Tell me everything. Tell me who she is. Her? She's an adventure. You're still concealing things. You don't want to tell me who that woman was? Very well, as you wish. Have you seen a woman in a blue American car? - Yes she was... - No, no, we didn't see anything. We would've noticed. - But, Gabriel... - Shut up. Get in the car. She would've had to stop for lunch. Shall we have lunch here? Alright? Yes, we'll see them from the terrace. Off we go! - Gabriel, slow down! - No! You're going to kill us! Slow down! - Impossible... 75! - What's wrong with you? Gabriel! Gabriel! - Why, say? - We must warn her! They're on her trail... The poor woman! We will save her! 80! - Gabriel, I'm not well. - It doesn't matter. - I do not recognize you anymore. - It's adventure. We're living a thriller. A real one! I don't like them! They'll think we're their enemy. - I feel awful! Slow down! - She's in danger! Here they are! Here they are! Leave me alone. You won't get anything. You're doing a disgusting job. I don't want to see you. Go away! I don't want to know anything. So you're not... Who are you? Who are you? - Gabriel Pegase, surveyor. - Surveyor? - Is he bothering you? - No. Leave him alone. So why have you been pursuing us? Explain yourself, I'm waiting. Please forgive me... Well? I was at the restaurant... where you had lunch. I heard everything. But heard what, Sir? Your conversation on the phone. You were talking very loud. So as I heard it all. I know. It's a race with death. The others want to poison you. You agreed to die courageously. That was very beautiful. But you can't let yourself be killed like that! There are ways to... ...defend... Don't tell me you want to die. Not at your age! There's nothing I can do. I've agreed to it. Thank you for your sympathy. Go now... Leave me to my fate. No... I don't want to abandon you. I saw the skinny man and the fat woman. - The skinny man? - Yes. Your pursuers. - Where? - At the restaurant, after you left. I put them on the wrong track. We need to report... They are coming! See how you hold on to life! Just a reflex action. - If I can help you... - I don't see how. Laurent! I want to speak to my driver. - May I examine the engine? - You're welcome. Gabriel! Gabriel! We have to go even faster. I can't get 3 days off. I don't want to be in Rome for only Sunday night! Rome? Are you going to Rome? We are too. Oh yes? That's a strange coincidence. Come with us. - To Rome? - Yes. To Rome. I'll respect your mystery and I'll protect you. I'll stop them from killing you. - I'll save you. - But... Don't say no. I've wanted to save someone for such a long time. You return your car, they meet her, chase her and lose your track. It's good, no? - Admirable, but I... - Say yes, you're saved. Death vanishes. You live! My car is here. And me, to defend you. You'll say yes? Why not? Does smoking bother you? Not at all... My sister loves the smell of tobacco. I don't know how to thank you. Don't mention it. - Is that your cramp? - Yes. Do you want us to have dinner here? Could we have dinner in Italy instead, after customs? What do you think? It doesn't matter. I'll wait. I've got used to suffering. Are you crossing the border for the first time? Yes. I'd rather not be beside you when I show my passport. - Are you risking a lot? - Not here. You'll see... it's just a formality. This is outrageous! You can’t do that. You dare to search me! Don't you know who I am? Get off! Take your hands off me! I'm here, Hermine, Laura. We'll be all right. Don't take that. Gabriel, help! The Valparaiso documents! They’re the lecture notes. Gabriel! Gabriel! Give me back my lecture! This is for my lecture! You're complicating the situation. It's quite clear-cut. You were on the Valparaiso and we find the documents. - Let go of me! - Take him away! This is for my lecture. Those are geometric figures. I can tell you the theorem. Any cycloidal curve based on the imaginary center from the plane of infinity begets, turning around an isotropic axis... Gabriel, stop walking. It's very irritating. How can WE be in prison?! This is how France rewards its scholars. I lost my suitcase on the road, I don't have anything. I'll go naked! I'll lend you something. Ha! Trousers, no doubt. They'd suit you. Now she dares to insult me! An adventuress! Because of you, we'll go to prison. - Be quiet. - Are you defending a spy? I order you to shut up! Your life belongs to you. I don't blame you. I expected no less of you. I want fresh air... The breath of life! I want to be free, to see the world! I'm seized by my cramp! Help! She's dying! - Mr Customs Officer! - She's dying! Don't worry. Women like her don't die easily. You're a good man. - I like your eyes. - Don't get excited. I have such a weak heart... Emotional stress could kill me. Stop! Don't leave me. I need affection. To find a friend... What's your name? Arsene. Arsene... Arsene... Go and get your boss... For me. I'd like to, but... Oh, the pain! My heart! My heart! Go quickly, before I die! Don't die! Too bad if he yells at me. I agree to forgive and forget. Just promise me... that I won't even be named. - I'll be as dumb as a... - Don't try. I want to stop. I want dinner. It's because of her... It's the punishment. No no! I don't want to look! Are you ill? I can't stand storms. I don't like this! It's raining! It's raining in my car! We'll not spend the night here. - We're not holding you back. - Keep your jokes for later! You speak to me in that tone, under my roof? In my car? Get out immediately! - Gabriel, get her out. - I'll leave when... Enough! Shut up, both of you! We're saved! A light in the darkness! - It's open. - You don't dare? Not dare? Me?! There's a draught. Don't be afraid... It's the echo. Listen... Boo! Anyone there? Anyone? It's weird. Don't hide... Answer. I don't like it... Let's get out of here. But there was a light. It's like a thriller. Don't try to scare me. - Do you have a lighter? - Yes. Here it is. Pardon. You have it? - I'm looking for it. Find it! I've got it! That was my hand. Don't be afraid. What are you doing? I'm looking for the lighter. I've got it. Who's there? Who's there? Answer or I'll shoot. - I've been hit! - Gabriel! Hands up! Quick, the light! There's a lot of them! Hermine, Laura, don't move. I'm here. Let me go! What's happening? Let me go! Show yourself now. Show yourself. I see them! Run away! You won't take me alive! I'll fight to the end! Like a beast! Finish me off! Fast! Does the light scare you? Cowards! Help! Help! Help! Come on! Help! Come and help me! Help! Help. My sister is going to die. It's a mistake, Sir! Forgive us for entering your home. It was raining. It's... It's music boxes. - The poor man! - He fainted. We're not wicked, Sir. Don't worry, here it is... The women! Women first! We're lucky. The owners are very nice. Do you think it's too hot? Gabriel, go get the suitcases. We're going to catch cold. Let's change into dry clothes. I forgot... My suitcase! I also have some dresses. You see. - Get her suitcase too. - I'll go. I'd have been sorry if you'd refused. Is it nervous shock? No. I believe it's a stomach cramp. "At the restaurant." "the proprietor..." Coffee, Madam? "When I have a cup of coffee, I can't get to sleep." How fast Signora learns! It's a pleasure, really! So, no coffee for Signora? A little champagne! Sir... Hermine... Gentlemen... My friends and I... from the bottom of our hearts... we say thank you. The language barrier can prevent... I'm tired. Gentlemen, if it were possible, we would like... "The pleasure of alcohol is a sought vice." Sleep. Tired. Yes I understand "sleeping". Umberto, the rooms have to be prepared. He would like to go to bed. Immediately Sir. Come on, come on! Just a moment! Don't laugh. It's... It's... It's big. The Latin sisters! Now I understand. "To eat spaghetti gracefully is not so easy." Quick, quick! Here are the rooms! May the Blessed Virgin and all the saints watch over your sleep, Miss! This is your room, Miss. Good night. Good night. Good evening. Good evening. Good night, thank you! Gabriel, take the other room. - Good night, Hermine. - Good night. La sua camera e qui, signore. Good night. Good night Miss. - Good night. Come on, hurry up! I am a great empress! And, gentlemen... I perform a homographic transformation... ...with a true coefficient... ...of the variable complex... ...in the plane... ...of infinity. I was working. I was going to bed. I saw a shadow. Good evening. You're not disturbing me The rain has stopped. Yes. The birds were singing. It's because of the moonlight. The nightingales... Am I intimidating you? Yes. Is this your lecture? You're holding it upside down. I didn't tell you my theorem, did I? Your theorem? No. It's a discovery which will upset geometry. - It's you who...? - Yes. It's me. In Rome, they'll give me the diploma after the congress. There's a congress? An international one. With a banquet. And I'll give my lecture and the theorem. Oh, tell me. It must be exciting. Any cycloidal curve having for base the center of the plane of infinity... generates, rotating around an isotropic axis, a quadric of revolution.' Keep going... it's wonderful. - That's it. - What a pity! Tell me more. No. - Why not? - You don't understand. You should work. Work? This is the result of 5 years of work. Work on your diction. "o", "a", "e". Look at my mouth. "The curve considered transforms..." You see, it's easy. Any cycloidal curve admitting for base the imaginary circle from the plane of infinity begets, turning around an isotropic axis, a quadric of revolution. Why did you steal the documents? I couldn't do otherwise. I was cornered. They were holding me. Don't judge me by appearances. If you knew them... The ones who wanted to poison you? No, others. - A rival gang? - Yes. Gang. international, like your congress. If you're in their clutches... You promised me not to ask me anything. Excuse me. It was out of.. Out of...? Out of sympathy. It's good like this that I'd understood. But I have already said too much. Goodbye. Thank you my friend. Thank you for everything. Gabriel, go to bed. Hello Miss. I'll never forget those minutes. Never. What a disgrace! Let's go! Any cycloidal curve admitting for basis the imaginary center from the plane of infinity begets, turning around an isotropic axis, a quadric of revolution. And I thought they were so nice! Yes, I said so. It felt like a thriller. What about the car? The suitcases? The car's here! They took our suitcases! It's all over. We've nothing left. You don't have anything either. You're like us. This is divine punishment! What a trip! You don't respect anything. You're a monster! I don't recognize you anymore. She's changed you. Gabriel, I forbid you to laugh. Gabriel! Chin up, Gabriel! Gabriel, stop laughing this instant! No! This situation just can't go on! At the next town, you'll take the train. Gabriel, I can't take the train... I'm allergic to them. I'll defend her to the end. Against you, if necessary. No. I don't break up families. I'll leave. No. You won't leave. Yes! I'm tired of everything. Let me go. I said no! Since she says yes, let her go. Oh, I have to die... ...sooner or later. You heard that? It's you who'll take the train! No! I can't separate you. I shall go alone... as always. You have to choose. I'll do my duty. Have her dress properly! Enough. If the real owners turn up, it will complicate everything. Let's go. Go on, Hermine. You're wonderful, Gabriel. You think so? Shall we have lunch at Villa Franca? I know, I hurt you... I've been hard. Leave me alone. I'm talking. They probably have lice! Go away! You hurt me, Gabriel. Scram you pest! You must understand, Hermine, I have responsibilities. These kids... Do something! Make them go away! Kids... kids... What is she doing? - She's phoning. - Phoning? I'm not waiting. It's rude. We'll be in Rome tomorrow or the next day. Leave this evening. Excellent. Not very comfortable. I'll tell you all about it. I'm with some crazy people. Oh no! No danger. It was great. No, no sign of them. They're still chasing an empty car. How about my death? They insist? Look... A French car. You can forget about her. Without you, what would become of me? Look. A French car. Nothing beats a French car. It's the engines. Mady, look at that woman. Doesn't she look like...? It's her! I've been looking for you for a long time. It's the fat woman! Go to the car... Start the engine! Let me go! Edgar! - Let me go! - Drive here! Gabriel! Gabriel! Gabriel... Don't abandon me! Gabriel! We forgot my sister! Let's go back. They'd kill me. You convinced me. I want to live. It's like in a movie! All that's missing are the police sirens. - You are having fun? - I'm made for adventure. You are too. We'll do great things, you and me. We're the same breed. Forget everything! I'll forget everything. Hermine... I can't forget Hermine. - Not happy to be with me? - Oh yes. - Show it, be cheerful! - It's duty above all. With her Italian phrase-book, she'll manage. They are coming. Let's go. Faster, faster! They'll pay dearly! She's a femme fatale. She wears trousers. She's hiding and she has dyed hair. Why is she hiding? She stole documents on a ship. And she stole my brother! Documents? On which boat? The Val... I don't know. Don't bully me! - The Valparaiso? - That's it, yes. And there's the other gang... The man and the woman. Oh Gabriel! This is a federal matter. Everyone get out! Not you, lady. Hello? Hello? Pisa! Pisa... We were to stop here... Hermine wanted to see the tower. Yes. A big blue one. Yes, a big blue car, French registration. Si. At your service. Thank you, Commander. They won't get far. - And Gabriel? - You can leave. - What should I do? - Go to Rome. Gabriel has all the money on him. Hitchhike. Are you are worried about your sister? Yes. - Are we going back there? - No. Your safety comes first. - Listen... - She'll join us in Rome. She knows where we'd be staying. If you explained everything to me, I could be much more helpful. I'll tell you everything, soon. - Truly? - Truly. They won't poison you. You can't do anything about that. Let's go. I have shopping to do. This is the central police station. Search and stop a French vehicle. Renault brand. Registration: 1 1 06 RN 7. Stop the passengers... ...especially a movie actress... ...by the name of Laura Lee... ...accused of the theft of secret documents... ...aboard the 'Valparaiso'. - To our journey. - To our journey. That's better than the other. To you. - To you. - To me. To your sister. - Ermine... It would make her happy we thought of her. - To her. - To her. She stayed in port. She was alone in port. To Hermine. We just did. Did we? - This is boring. - Very. - To nothing. - To nothing. It was a good idea. That's beautiful. It's beautiful. I love music. Smell them? The laburnums. The evening wind in the laburnums. Vesuvius. Vesuvius is much further. Go and pick some laburnums for me. Make me bouquets. Throw me flowers. There are no laburnums. No laburnum? Yes there is. Up there. This is wisteria. Wisteria... Cover me with laburnum. Throw me laburnums. Let's go see Vesuvius. There is no Vesuvius. And the laburnums are wisteria. I want laburnums. These are wisteria. Oh, no laburnum. And Vesuvius? Vesuvius... is gone. There was a cataclysm. It's not poetic here. Let's get out of here. Gabriel... Tell me these are laburnums. I can't. These are wisteria. You always know everything. I would like these to be laburnum, Gabriel... More! Gabriel... Look at the laburnums. Laburnums? Where? There. Oh, an arbor of laburnums. - It's Italy. - Long live Italy! - To Italy. - Long live Italy. - To Italy! - Long live Italy! admitting for basis the imaginary center from the plane of infinity generates, while turning around an isotropic axis, a quadric of revolution. It's beautiful... modern poetry. Let's go see the sea. It's not the sea, it's a lake. Lake Trasimeno. It's still water. Oh, islands! Land! Land? Watch out for laburnums. It's wisteria. - It's like in... - In what? It doesn't concern you. My heart is broken. Go away! I'll be waiting for you. Is that English? I love you, Richard! You're leaving me! You also have heartaches? You're slipping in the shade of the maples. There we were dancing. - I can't dance. - Don't mess it up. But I don't know how. I'm in a mood for you... Music! I'm not short-sighted any more! I'm not short-sighted! I'm not short-sighted! So what? It's 25 years I've been wearing glasses. I'm not short-sighted. I'm not short-sighted! I'm not short-sighted! I'm not short-sighted! Moonlight and guitars... Gimme! Gimme. Finished? Nothing. - Gabriel... - Yes? - Boats. - Boats. Let's be romantic, Gabriel. Let's row. Let's row on the waters. Let's go. Let's be romantic. Be careful. Let's go. Let's go on the dark waters. There are waves. Yes. A storm will rise. Let's go back. Yes, let's go back. Land! Already? Climb on me. - Nice walk? - Lovely. It's gone away. Where are they? Let's go! This way! Music! Orchestra! Well, music! - The police! - The police? A date! - Lie down there. - Yes. I'm going to sleep. - You're hurting me... - Hush! On the right, attention, They run away! To drink! Long live Italy! - Hush! Viva ltalia! Viva ltalia! Viva, viva! Where did they go? Stop! Stop! Stop! Laura, don't go! Stay with me! Laura, stay with me! Laura! Stop! Stop, Gabriel! Stop or I'm going home! I can't! I don't know how it works! Don't be afraid! We'll make it! What did you say? They're shooting! I don't want to die! I told you that you risk nothing! As long as you're with me, you risk nothing! They lost us! The searchlight! - Quick, the searchlight! - It's broken! Damn it! I gave them the slip! - Where are we going? - To the islands! - They escaped us! - By the Blessed Virgin! Save me! I fooled them! Allons enfants de la patrie... Le jour de gloire est... We're going home. Okay, let's go. Are you pleased with yourself? We're wet, but free. That's enough romance, thank you! If my calculations are correct, we're on the smallest island.... ...and it's uninhabited. Let's go back. Go get the rowboat. The rowboat's somewhere over there. The police are over there. - Are you cold, perhaps? - No. I'm too hot. I'm suffocating. You're too hot too. Take a bath! You saved my life. I was drowning. Thanks. Don't mention it. Do like me... It warms you up. Rhythmically! One. Two! One. Two! One. Two! One. Two! One. Two! One... You've stopped? Maybe you’re mad at me, but it’s not my fault. It was for you. I saw the police. You're so beautiful. You are... It would be awful, if they arrest you. Laura... Laura, are you mad at me that much? It wasn't my fault. It was, you know. Sit down there. - You haven't warmed up. - Not completely. When Hermine's cold, I rub her back. That's it. Rub my back. - That's good? - Yes. Keep going. Not so hard! Thanks. That's OK. You look much better like that. Why were you wearing glasses? Hermine said I needed them. Without your jacket, you look bigger. You wouldn't be bad-looking if you were fixed up. If your hair was like that. Look at me. You'd even be handsome. You'd be really lovely if... if a woman took care of you. Hermine takes care of me. You look like Gary. Gary? Gary Cooper. You know... An American. A great friend of mine. An American? He's very nice. Do you always live in America? Most of the time. I'm still cold. Rub my back again. - What is it? - Mosquitoes. There are mosquitoes! Too bad. I'll be disfigured! Oh no, no! No! I'll be disfigured! You always have wonderful ideas. You haven't read 'The Island of Green Death'? The castaways always sleep like that. It stings. Just at first. The leaves will flatten out. I have to tell you... I told you a lot of stories. What do you mean? I told you... No nothing. Up you get! Up you get! It's time. You're at my house. The island's inhabited. It's not an island. They're over there. We crossed the lake without realising. You're distracted, too. You lose things. I lose everything. I forget everything. A few days ago, I lost... You too have lost something? Oh! I forgot. I forgot what I lost. My lecture. He's like me! Are you a diplomat? I have to redo it, rewrite it. You'll do it in Rome. Paper... Something to write with! It's alright. I have some on me. Who mentioned Rome? I did. There's something on it, but write on the back. "I perform a homographic transformation..." "From the complex variable..." What is the fastest way to go to Rome? Going to Rome? My car! - Have you lost it? - It's back there. He lost his car! He lost his... What have you lost? Rome. Go to Rome. Go to Rome? What a wonderful idea! It just came to me. We're going to Rome! Get the car ready, quick! Vera? Vera Alexandrovna? It's the Grand Duchess. What time are we leaving? You're leaving already? Stay for a while. - Where do you want to go? - To Rome. With you. - Above all, don't tell anyone. - I won't. Vera? Vera Alexandrovna? We are leaving for Rome! I don't understand Russian. - Do you? - No, me neither. We're there! Rome! It wouldn't have been easy. Why on earth are we going to Rome? - You had to explain to me. - I don't know anymore. I'll explain later. In Rome. Oh, what a pretty face! - There! - Where? Charming. Really lovely! Who did she look like? Yes, my good friend. She looked like... What is going on? The woman from the ship! Don't be afraid... I won't hurt you. Listen to me! Don't be afraid... Hide. I'm here. - Laura, where are you going? - Stop! We will meet again in Rome! - We have a score to settle! - Let go of me! Do you still think about her? Yes. A half-crazy adventuress. She's not an adventuress, she's an actress. - It's true about the poison. - The poison? Jobard! - Be polite. Listen. - I don't understand. Neither do they. It's not a reason. You see. - No no no! - It's the most beautiful death. The Borgias... No. In Hollywood, everyone dies poisoned. I've already died twice like that. I want a totally new death on screen, or I don't do the film. - Everything is ready. - Let's change everything! And the money it will cost? And this? Do you want to explain to me? Is it just for publicity? [Did Laura Lee steal Valparaiso documents?] You might have told me. I'm your producer. Don't piss me off with that! So, explain it to me! - Where are you going? - I'm going home. It's in your honour... Let me give this Renaissance ball! It's costing me a fortune. All Rome is invited. Even artists and journalists are invited. You won't let me down with my champagne? - Will you shut up? - I'll be silent. ...Gabriel Pegase. Laura! Thank you. Don't mention it. Well, say hello. Laura Lee! - I'm bored. - Holidays don't last. I'd like to find him. He was funny. It's a wonderful evening. Darling! I'm so glad to see you. Damn! The silly old duffer! This time, I won't miss her. Come on. Your lecture... It's time. Ladies and gentlemen... Louder. Ladies and gentlemen... It's not without emotion... ...that I'm among you this evening. It's her. Keep talking! Here is the theorem. "Any cycloidal curve... "admitting for... for... I don't know it anymore, Hermine. Well read it! "Admitting as basis "the imaginary center "plan... "Plan... "Plan... "Of all importance... "Let the squadron get under way "without delay. "The above-mentioned bomb... "exploding, destroyed within a radius of 1,000 kilometers, "any building "in its path. "The machine is made up "of a charge "based on the isotope "237 of... "plutonium." My Documents! My secret documents! Thank you! I'll have you decorated. Give me the documents! Don't give them away! They're confidential! Gabriel! Leave it! Let him be, Madam. Oh, sex-maniac! The documents! The documents! The documents! Gabriel! Gabriel! It's her again. She sabotaged your triumph! Gabriel, where are you? Help, they all went crazy! They're crazy! Help, they're crazy! - Where are they going? - There may be a fire. Fire? There's a fire! Laura! Laura! Fire! Fire! Fire! Laura, there's a fire! Don't be afraid! Laura! Laura, where are you? Laura! Laura! There is fire, Laura! Gabriel! Gabriel! I'm so happy to see you again. - There's not a minute to lose. - There's no fire. - Who's this? - The man who wants to poison me. A good thing done. Fire wins. Come quickly. But what happened? Gabriel! Gabriel! Gabriel! It's a trick! That madwoman! Where's the phone? Edgar! So, I wanted to distract myself... ...Forget my job... Not see journalists. You had fun, that's the main thing. You're so nice. Signor Gabriel Pegase. Gabriel! I'll go see you at the movies. I don't like movies. You'll get used to them. I'll have to. Signor Gabriel Pegase. Surveyor. I'll send you the Geometry Bulletin. Sometimes they talk about me. That's nice. It will be a piece of you. Signor Gabriel Pegase. Gabriel! I must have been very ridiculous, mustn't I? Ridiculous? No? You've been... You've been wonderful. For you, the danger existed. It might have been true, right? Yes. You were sublime at times. Me? Yes... YOU. Why did you kiss me? Because I didn't... Because I wanted to. Kiss me. What? Kiss me. It'll give you a nice memory. Yes. I believe you're right. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
