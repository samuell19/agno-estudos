Studio 1 presents a Hungarian-American cooproduction The Paul Street Boys After the novel with the same title written by Ferenc Molnar Written by Zoltan Fabri and Endre Bohem Music by Emil Petrovics Director of photography Gyorgy Illes Produced by Endre Bohem Producer Otto Fold Directed by Zoltan Fabri ...if two chemical substances show the same phenomenon of light perceptible to the eye when meeting naked light it does not necessarily mean that the two substances are identical. For example, the sodium and the sodium chloride both changed the light of the Bunsen burner to yellow... - Nemecsek! We put the crystalline barium sulphate onto a thin rod of platinum... Nemecsek! ...heating it for a short time... then we put a drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid on it. In this very moment we can see as an intensive green light is blazing up... - Pass it on to Boka! Boka! in fact, it is only a process of reduction, where barium sulphide comes to being. What's this disquiet? The lesson hasn't finished yet! Csengey! Close that window! What? - It's from Gereb... - Presidential election at 3 p.m. at the Plot. - Nemecsek! Come here! Repeat and interpret the experiment! Presidential election at 3 p.m. at the Plot! - Why, what for? - Is Boka calling for us? Yes. Tell it to everyone! There hasn't been enough time to announce it. Csonakos! Csonakos! Csonakos! Csonakos! Csonakos! Why are you howling, laddie? What did Gereb tell you? Why does he want it? Ask me another... - Don't you think it's about the Museum? - It's also possible... Have Boka and the boys already left? I should say so! I'll tell them, too. Will you come? - Boka hasn't heard it yet? - No, he hasn't! Sure, I'll go! So, get a move on, laddie! Has there been an 'einstand' again? Scandalous! And who were they? The Pasztor boys. The two Pasztor boys. Dirty rascals! I've been telling you for a while that something must be done, but Boka is always making a sour face about it. However we have to do something. So let's do something! Come on! Stop it! You're deafening me! Hasn't Gereb just said that we must do something? So, how did it happen? Well, yesterday after lunch we went out to the Museum, I mean Weis and I and Leszik and Richter and Barabas and we started playing marbles and we rolled the marbles one after the other, there were about twenty of them at the wall three of them were glass ones. And then suddenly Leszik said: - Everything is over! The Pasztor boys are coming! They were coming so slowly that we all were getting really frightened. No matter that there were five of us, they are so strong that they'd thrash ten. The Pasztor boys are the best runners in the whole Museum. You can run as fast as you can, they'll catch you. Listen, Nemecsek! Let's stop it! Now? Not a bit! You've just rolled and you've failed! It's my turn. If I win, we'll stop. Einstand! You do not have the right to do this! Couldn't you hear what I've said? Einstand! Go on, collect them and hand them over to us! And I had to collect them and hand them over... Although, by that time there were seven glass marbles among them! Dirty rascals! What time is it, Csele? Oh dear, I have to hurry up, it's almost two! We'll talk everything over at the Plot at 3 p.m. Hang on, laddie, wait! We don't hurry, do we? One does not pass by the snuff factory just like that! I'll show you something! Snuff, laddie, snuff! That's bloody good, Csonakos! Bloody good! You can fret and fume about it, great snuff snu-snu-snu-snuffing, atishoo! pinching, sneezing, to-to-to, angering my nose la-la-la... Good day, Jano! Good afternoon, young man! Hello, Hektor, hello my dear little dog! What's up, Hektor? What do you want? Do you want something, Hektor? What's wrong with you, Hektor? Who's that up there? Who's it? Why don't you answer me? Don't be silly, I saw you! Have no fear, Hektor! Have no fear, my little dog! Have no fear, Nemecsek! Have no fear, Nemecsek! Have no fear, Nemecsek! Have no fear, Nemecsek! Have no fear, Nemecsek! Did he shout at you? And what did he shout? He shouted 'Aren't you afraid, Nemecsek?' And weren't you afraid? No. I stopped under the fortress, then he climbed down at the back and disappeared. He ran away. Well, that's a lie! Ats would never ran away, he's not a coward. Now then, how much you're defending him! I'm not defending him at all, I'm just saying it. It's not likely indeed, that Feri Ats got frightened of Nemecsek. Today's presidential election was proposed by Gereb. If you want to say something, just do it now, before we vote. There's nothing else to say. It's just enough what's happened. Yesterday the Pasztor boys at the Museum, today Ats at our place. Who knows what they're about to do tomorow? We can't leave it without a response, it's a scandal! This is my opinion. No, we can't, that's true! We need a president and that's that. But someone with full powers, someone who knows what he wants. And so he'll respond. Kolnay! Give me your cap! We'll collect the votes in it. In Kolnay's cap? Are you kidding? Kolnay's cap is thick with fat! What do you mean? - You can have a look at this cap! - It's disgusting. Take this, here's my hat! Let me see! I just won't let it be! My boy, your hat is much thicker with fat! You should fling your own dirty, greasy, stinking cap! Janos Boka ... Dezso Gereb ... Janos Boka ... Dezso Gereb ... ...and Janos Boka. That's it, there's no more. So, there are 29 votes for Boka, and 3 for Gereb. This means we elected Boka our president. So, and what's the practice in such a case? Well, we have to congratulate the new president. Many happy returns, Boka... Long live the new president... Congratulations... Congratulations, laddie... Be a good president and do a lot of wise things! A further point, a further point! - You also received three votes. - Yes, I did. I'd like to talk to you after the physical exercises this afternoon. So about what? Well, about what our plan should be. I've got some ideas. But you should think, too. Will you? I will. I'll think about it. Boka! What did you say, what will there be tonight? I'm going to the Botanical Gardens with two volunteers. We'll slink in to the island and leave there a slip saying, we were there. That's quite dangerous, Boka! The Redshirts are always there at night. Sure, they are. That's why I want to go there at night. Listen, we should write something rude on it, too. No! We'll simply show them that we're not afraid of them. Hasn't Gereb told you anything? No, he hasn't. Why? Why he didn't come to PE. He hasn't told me a word. With whom are you going there, Boka? I don't know, yet. I terribly would like to go with you! You'll take me, Boka, won't you? Don't be silly, you of all people? That's a dangerous venture, you're too young. Oh, really... you're always telling me that! Are you coming, Csele? Well, I can't because... you know... My mother keeps it in mind when my PE finishes. And if I were late some day, then... Oh, I've left my trainers there! Just go now, I'll catch you up! Are you also in a hurry, Csonakos? Are you kidding, laddie? You can always count on me! And on me, Boka! Really! You could do this for me! Nor want I to remain a common soldier. Everybody has already become an officer. It's only me who's still a common soldier. There must also be common soldiers. What would an army be like without any soldiers? Yes, I know. But why me? Why just me? It's not fair! And at last that would be a great chance for me to do something. And so you could promote me. And you don't want to give me that chance! Look at yourself! You're almost crying. He's crying, laddie, he's almost crying! Shut up! It's not true that I'm crying! That's why you should not work with a puppy! Let's demote him, demote him! Hey, how can a common soldier be demoted? How he begged to come with us... Don't worry, it's just eight. Exactly. That's why we won't wait for him. We'll leave without him. Don't be silly, laddie! Wait! Boka! I'm here! Where have you been? On my way here a shop-window was just being fitted with glass, not far from here. I couldn't miss the chance! Look, what a beautiful piece! I'm amazed! Look at it! It's much better than the Club's putty. That's not so soft anymore. I'm really bored of your stupid club. You're ridiculous. Why isn't the Plot enough for you? What is that stupid little club good for? Putty Club! It's a joke. You're risking our plan with it! So what have I risked? I was here at eight o'clock sharp. Csonakos, tell them, have I risked any... Oh! What's that? Oh! Quiet! Don't be silly! Are you mad, Csonakos? And you? Why are you howling as a jackal? Do you want to go there roaring? That's the tree. We can have a try. Come on! You should keep creeping for a while... There aren't any bushes. We have to get along this somehow. - They've seen us! - On your face! It seems to be clear. What was that? I think the guards have been changed on the bridge. Come on! Boka! Don't leave me here! Boka! Don't run so fast! Boka! Boka! Boka! Don't cry all the time! What's that? That's the ruin. If it rains, they range in it. Listen, is that a real ruin? It's not real, it's an artificial ruin. What do you mean by artificial? I mean it was built as a ruin. When they built it, was it built to be a ruin? Shut up, don't chatter so much! You're always chattering! Look at their cool caps! And their great equipment! They're more than us. Well... more. Wow, it's smashing! Where have you got it from? It's from Csele's sister. I think they're about to do something. Or it's an evening practice..or...oh, my God! What can you see? Tell us what you see! There on the right, he ... Who's that? he... He disappeared... But who was that? Did you see someone? Who did you see? Tell me at last! Idiot, why do you keep frightening this kid? Shhhh! So, come on, I've found a boat! Go as far from the bridge as possible and row softly! Come on, laddie, come on! I'm coming, laddie! Did you drink? No, I didn't. ..the Plot consists of two parts. The bigger one is huge, like an establishment, there's nothing on it. There you can play meta, or anything else. The timber-yard is on the other side. That's guarded by Jano, but he only cares about the timber. So it can be approached from two directions. Don't worry, Erno! It's possible to enter from the Paul Street, that's the direct entrance. But it's hard to get through, because according to the law, if you enter, you have to secure the gate as you pass through it. The other entrance is from Maria Street. Here the gate of the saw is wide-open. You can also get into the Plot from here among the wood-piles. That's only difficult because of the fortresses among the wood-piles. I know. Oh, sure. You must know it since you've been there. So, there are guards in the fortresses, that's why I won't suggest you to come from that direction. We had better arrange your arrival. Then I will arrive last and leave the small gate from Paul Street open. That's the right thing to do. I will occupy the Plot while they're there. And we'll fight. That's right... So it is.. If they can defend it, it will be theirs. If not, we'll set up our flag and it will be ours. You know, that's question of life and death for us. That's clear. We need the Plot because we need a place to play ball. We're not kidding. Don't keep sighing! So, that's a deal. We can count on you. Yes. That'll do for today. I will tell the team about the operational plan tomorrow. To arms! Erno, what you've seen you mustn't tell it to anybody. Not even to Csonakos! Is that clear? I see. - Honestly? - Honestly. Wait here and don't move! Run after me as fast as you can. The Paul Street's boys! They've been here! Guards, come here! I report, nobody could come to the island across the bridge. They turned off the lights! Didn't you realise it? They must have come on boat! Quiet! Wendauer, up the tree! You'll look around and report. Pasztor boys, go to the bridge. Surround on the shore from both directions. Everybody, follow us! They are running across the bridge! The boat has gone ashore! There are 3 of them! They must be caught! It's quite warm. That's great! Can't you watch out? Wait! I'll strike a light in a minute. - They are in the greenhouse! - Are you mad? - Cut the way, surround from the right and from the left! - Hide! Oh dear, Boka! Where shall I hide? Into the pool, you're wet anyway! They thought we couldn't see the light? Pasztor boys, take this door! Szebenics and I will go through the other one! Let's go! Hurry up... run... we'll give them a good thrashing... They could not go out from here. Take a look under each shelves! Check every nook! There! - What can you see, Szebeni? - There... There, as if somebody had gone out! Did you see him at this door? Yes, definetely. He ran out this way. You can come out, Erno! Damn it, laddie! He's thrown a pot on my head. Oh dear, Boka! That was cold! That was terribly cold! I want to know how you dared to found a club! After all, I've told you that I couldn't tolerate any kind of a club! Who founded it? Me... I founded it, Professor. Weiss. I see. Sure, I might have known it. So. Let's see one after the other. First of all, tell me what is 'putty'? That's putty. What's that? That's a ..what's-it...glaziers use it to fasten window panes. The glazier smears it on and we scrape it off with our finger-nails. And, and did you scrape this one? No, sir. This one is club property, collected by the members. I've just taken care of it because the committee has entrusted it to me. Because before that it was in charge of Kolnay. But he let it dry up. Because he never chewed it. So, you have to chew it? Yes, otherwise it becomes hard, and then you can't keep kneading it. But why should you keep kneading it? Because... So you can decide whether the putty is good or not. I chewed it every day. And why you? Because... I'm the secretary-general. I see... And why does the secretary-general have to chew it, of all people? Because... It was put down in our constitution. We have to chew it once a day, so that it always remains soft. So that it always remains soft? Fantastic. Putty Club. To keep it soft they chew the putty. Great! Is there a cashier? Kolnay. Kolnay... Put out the club money on the table! Empty your pocket! Where have you got the money from? The... From the membership fee. Everybody payed in six pennies each week. And what did you need that money for? What is the membership fee for? To be paid in. Well, and these ones? The postcard is from Barabas, the bill stamp is from the Richter. Since his father is a lawyer... and so... And what's this?! You also have a stamp? You've concealed this one! Where's the stamp? Barabas is the stamp keeper... Putty Collector's Club, Budapest, 1902. We solemnly swear to be free forever! Incredible! You, rascals! So, what shall I do with you? So?! So tell me what happened? The Putty Club. Someone has revealed it. Didn't he ask about the Plot? No, he didn't. Are you sure? Sure. It didn't come up. I was afraid, it did. Did he ban it? Yes. Are you happy now? I always hated it. Well, now it's over. No stamp, no money, no putty. But that's what I mean. If at least we had that. If only we had a piece of bloody, stinking putty... We have that... Wow... Look at this... What a huge piece... Fresh and fine... So bye then, I'm leaving before I get sick... - Where is it from? - From the store where I stood, behind the skeleton. - It was a new window and... - Let me see! It's so soft! You're great! You've just saved the Club! If there's some putty, the Club exists! I recommend to call a special meeting! At half past 2 at the Plot. Right? Right... Great... Hurray! I'm proposing a motion on changing the constitution. The general meeting should vote! From now on it shouldn't be the secretary-general who daily chews the club's putty but the cashier. Why the cashier? And why the secretary-general? But why the cashier of all people? The stamp keeper should chew it! I'm not going to chew it! Tell me, what has the stamp keeper to do with chewing? Especially, if there's no stamp, since the cashier disclosed it. - I didn't disclose it! - Yes, you did! - No, I didn't! - He didn't disclose it, noo... Well then...? Who should chew it? And what about the secretary? Right...The secretary should do it... Good idea, isn't it? The secretary asks permission to speak. Here you go! Gentlemen! I'll chew the putty with pleasure indeed if the General Meeting comes to the decision that it's my duty. That's an honour and obligation, too, and things like that, and I really don't want to wriggle out of it... Jano! Jano! Hello Gereb, will you join us? Maybe later. Jano! Jano! Gereb is looking for you! I' hear' it, too. But Jano just can't fly! Wait a minute, Mr. Gereb! Not hurry! He's coming! Mr Secretary, go on! Mr Secretary! (Some German words...) Good day, Jano! Good day, young sir! What is order? Be serious, Jano! I don't give orders, at most I might ask you something. If I can do it, we'll see... You like good cigar, don't you, Jano? You're a funny young man, Mr Gereb! Who don't love good cigar? Since I brought you one. Have you? Yes, I have. Here you are. Last time Jano smoking whole cigar was at army exercises. They got it from Herr Leutnant when army exercises was over. You could get some more... If you do something for me. What the task is, young sir? Boys must be driven away from here, Jano! From the Plot. Drive away? These? Yes. But you mustn't tell them. And why have to drive them away? Well, because... From now on others want to come here. All rich boys! You'll have as many cigars as many you want, Jano! And money... Boka! Boka! Where's Boka? Where's Boka? He hasn't arrived, yet, laddie! What's wrong, is the house burning? Mr Secretary! Soldier! What are you always running around? Go away! Soldier, here! We've just made a decision that form now on we'll keep the Putty Club secret. If you, Mr Secretary, want to keep your position, you will have to take an oath on secrecy with us... if Professor Ratz gets to know that... Mr Secretary-General! Now I have no time for this. Mr Secretary! Don't go away! Come back! Now you all could witness Erno Nemecsek's behaviour! Hereby I declare that Erno Nemecsek is a coward... And a traitor! Well, have you seen anything like that? That's scandalous! I propose that he should be excluded from the Club and his name should be entered in the secret minutes with small letters! With small letters? Is it possible that Mr Secretary-general is not brave enough to treat with a traitor? Those of you who agree, raise your hands! Mr Notary, enter his name with small letters. And that he's a coward. 23 April 1902 erno nemecsek A TRAITOR!!! But speak to him in private, nobody should hear it! Everything hinges on whether you can ... What's wrong with you, Erno? Oh, it hurts so bad when I cough ... Ah, rubbish! There he goes! Gereb! Listen, he's going to meet... them again! Them again... He'll bring them here... They'll take the Plot from us! They're stronger! What are we going to do now? What will happen to the Plot? I don't know. You don't know? You have to know! Can you hear me, Boka? If you don't know, who will know? Salute! - Is everyone here? - Yes, Sir! - Gereb as well? - He was first here, Sir! Sir, I report that the red-green flag that you took from the Paul Street Boys is missing from the storehouse. Any footprints? There are some. Last evening I dusted the floor of the ruin with sand, as usual. And when I examined it today, I found small footprints in it. They were much smaller than those of Wendauer, although he's got the smallest feet among us. They charged someone with stealing the flag back. No idea, Gereb? No, nothing. Make your report! I thought, maybe ... Stand up if you report! So, what have you got? I've been thinking that maybe... perhaps... Perhaps we could take the Plot without fighting. I thought that ... What do you mean by 'without fighting'. I don't understand. Well... I... I've bought the guard off. The one who looks after the plot and is just going to chase them... I see. It seems to me that you still don't know anything about the Redshirts, Gereb! We never buy anybody off. That's not how we work! And we never haggle with anybody! We'll go there fairly and simply take it from them. You well-groomed smart boy! Where do you keep your brain? In your trousers? - He's an idiot! - Do you think that we are just the same cowards as you are? If you're a coward, go home! I'm not a coward... I'm with you... And I swear an oath on loyalty. That will happen before we leave. Now, sit down! The attack is to take place tomorrow. We'll start from here. Half of the group will enter from the Maria Street and occupy the fortresses. Gereb will open the Paul Street gate for the rest. So they'll be confused with the two directions. They'll either run away or they'll be defeated among the wood-piles. No quarter given! We're going to catch their balls! And squeeze them a little! - I like your plan, boss! - At long last, we can skirmish! Gereb! Do the Paul Street Boys suspect that you belong to us? I don't think so. I also visited them today. And even if they did so, they wouldn't dare to say anything. There isn't a brave boy among them! What a cheek you have ... Who's that? It's me. Nemecsek... Yes, it's me. One of those cowards from the Paul Street. I've got those small feet, even smaller than those of Wendauer. I took our flag back. Here it is. Look! So, go ahead! Do anything to me that you want! Beat me to death or wrest it from my hands! Since I'm certainly not going to hand it over by myself! Wait, hands off. I like this kid! You're a brave boy, Nemecsek. What about joining us? As a 2nd lieutenant, straightaway, so? It's a whiz, Nemecsek! Thank you... No. As you wish. If you don't want to. What shall we do with him? Take the flag away from him! Ready. Storehouse-keeper! Take it over! He is too small to be thrashed... A cold bath will do it! Come on, laddie, come on! Are you biting, you little girl? Take his legs! One.. Two... Three! Frog, frog, croaking! A frog with an open mouth! Croak, croak, croaking.... Did you like it? Yes, I did. It was much better than standing on the shore and laughing. I'd much rather sit in the water till New Year's Day than join the enemies of my friends. It's easy for you to treat me. The stronger wins. It was also easy for the Pasztor boys when they took my marbles away at the Museum, since they were stronger. There's about thirty of you, while I'm alone. You can even beat me to death if you want, but you'd rather drown me or beat me to death, I'm not going to be a traitor. Not like someone who's standing there. There... Can I leave now? So you won't beat me to death? Can I go now? Can I go? Attention! Salute! Please, Feri, I would appreciate it if you could tell me what to do until the battle, so that... Please... I hope that you won't identify yourselves with that kid's ... Boys, well I ... I guess I can leave now, too... Did you take those marbles away from that kid at the Museum? Yes, I did. Was your brother with you? Yes. It was an 'einstand', wasn't it? It was. Didn't I tell you that the Redshirts wouldn't take marbles away from weak kids? Come on, into the lake! Are you deaf? As you are, with your clothes on. Bathe! And those who laugh at them, will go as well! About turn! Don't stare at them! Go on, bathe! Into the water! Up to your chins. Proclamation! The Plot is in danger! The Redshirts want to attack us! But we'll be there and if it's needed we'll even die for our empire! You know your duties! The president. And when are they planning to attack? Tomorrow. Right tomorrow? So suddenly? Yes. Lieutenant Csele, what about the caps? Five officer's caps and one soldier cap are ready. I've already sorted them out. That's for you, Mr President. The rest will be ready for next morning. Just... My sister hasn't got enough money for all the gold strings. So the stripes... All right. We'll talk about it later. Thank you! Herewith I declare that there's state of siege. I'm parting with the status of the president... .. and I'm taking the status of a general. We have to make the most of this afternoon. This is our last chance to prepare for the battle. But first we'll take an oath. Stand up! Sorry... Repeat... I'll fight for the Plot... ...against the enemy... ...with all my might... I give my word for it. Thank you. And those who won't be here are traitors and must not set foot in here anymore. - I'd like to ask something! - Go on. Mr General, we're all present except for Gereb. Where's he? Gereb is a traitor. A traitor? How is it possible? He joined the Redshirts. The Redshirts? You don't say! The Redshirts? But how? That's a nasty story. I'll tell you everything in details. But not now. We have more important things to do. Soldier! Give me the operational plan. Thank you! During the battle my adjutant will be by my side all the time. He will transmit my orders and sound the horn for you. The things he transmits are to be regarded as my words. Who is your adjutant? Nemecsek. Csele! I'll need your watch! And stay with me, enter everything in the minutes! Barabas! Come on, speak! That's absurd! Forget it! You're the one who likes talking. Then you, Weisz! Or you, Richter! After all, we can't simply let it alone! What's wrong, Kolnay, what's the matter? Well, you know... At the last meeting of the Putty Club, when... I know. You entered his name with small letters, as a traitor. That's just as stupid as the whole Putty Club! I beg your pardon! Instead of offending the Club, after all, you'd better ask us about the reason for ... Boys! We have to do army excercises this afternoon. And we even have to build! There's no time for arguments! Herewith I suspend the functioning of the Putty Club for the time of the battle! You do what? Suspend? And hereby I distrain upon its possessions for military purposes. That's a shame! I'm leaving, nobody can do this to me! - Nor to me! - I'm leaving, too! Let me remind the members of the Club of taking the oath. I court-martial the pickers of quarrels! So, I'm really scared now! What will that court-martial do with me? - You'll see! - Castration, laddie, at least! Professional castration without pains! I'm calling upon Lieutenant Kolnay to come back on pain of degradation, and to hand over the secret possessions of the Club, 2 forints and 97 pennies! How do you know that it's 2 fts and 97 pennies? I know. Don't be stupid, Kolnay, we'll have military expenses! What's the secretary-general's point of view? You have to hand it over. You took the oath. I stand by my protest beyond recall! And now I'm going to outline the operational plan. Come closer! According to the reports of the spies, the enemy is going to attack from two directions. From the Paul Street and from the Maria Street. All the wood-piles will act as fortresses stocked with sandbombs. Nr 1, 2, 3 will be the main fortresses and Nr 3A will be the spare fortress. It will be built of paraffin barrels so that it can hide Jano's hut. What are these red squares among the wood-piles? New piles. We have to build them. We need them because the Redshirts ... Wrap that scarf round your neck, Erno. You've caught a bad cold. Ah, that's nothing. It will be over. They still don't know what you've done for us. I want to announce it with ceremony after the battle, and also your promotion. But Boka! How can you think of such a thing? - I hope you don't think that I did it to ... - Sure, that's not what I think. But still, that's your due! I report, we're ready! Thank you. Well, then go, Erno! Take the order that everyone should move from the two back fortresses to the front line. I want to time it! Yes, sir! Hey, hey! All right, that was quite good. I'd like to speak to you. I have nothing to say to you. You'd better leave now, just as you came in. Janos! I came here as a good friend. You can't come here as a good friend anymore. I've brought back your flag, which was taken by Feri Ats ... ... and which was taken back by Nemecsek yesterday. But the Pasztor boys wrested it from his hands. Laddie, by gosh! He also went there yesterday! Sheer madness!! Did you hear it? He was there again! It's incredible! He was fighting with the Pasztor boys! Unbelievable, would you have thought it? Nemecsek! Jesus, he'll forgive him finally! Put down the flag on the stone! I'll send it back to them. We'll take it back ourselves. If we can. But we don't need the flag from you. And we don't need you, either. Janos! I admit that I've done big harm to you... Still I'm asking you to forgive me! - I've already forgiven you. - And do you take me back? No. Not that. By no means? No. By no means. Don't cry, Gereb! I don't want you to cry infront of me. You should have thought earlier. Why don't you let me remedy my fault? You can't remedy betrayal, Gereb. It's not a fault. It's much more than that. You'd better go home and leave us alone! If I asked you again to take me back, would it be in vain? Yes, it would. So then ... ... I won't ask you! Hurray for the General! You're a tough chap, laddie! You shall live long! Nemecsek! Who are you greeting? There's noone in the street. I'm greeting Professor Ratz. - Stop! Who are you? - Envoys. Can't you see the white flag, you idiot? Envoys have arrived! There you are. We've brought back the flag that you had taken from us. We've had it but we don't want it that way. Bring it along when you come tomorrow to fight and we'll take it if we can. If we can't, it will be yours. This message is from my general. - Szebenics Storehouse keeper! - Yes, sir! - Take the flag from the envoys! - Yes, sir! The flag will be carried by Szebenics storehouse keeper tomorrow. That's my answer. The day after tomorrow? But I don't understand! Our spies reported about tomorrow. A lot of things came up while making the plans. Then can I take it as an official statement? Yes, it's official. At 3 p.m. the day after tomorrow. Thank you. I have one more comission. Our general wants to agree on the rules of the battle through my assistance. What are the suggestions? Sandbombs, wrestling, fencing with lance. Right. The one with both of his shoulders on the ground is out of battle. That's what you mean? Yes. And the lances mustn't be used either for fighting or for stabbing. Only for fencing. All right. And two can't attack one, unless the other troop commits a foul. Right, but troops can attack troops. Of course. - Disregarding the number of them. - Disregarding the number of them. We accept the conditions. Thank you. One more question. Our flag was taken back to you by Gereb, wasn't it? Sorry... ..but I have no authorization for that. About turn! March! Listen, little girl! Does anybody live here with the name Nemecsek in this house? That door on the ritht. We are looking for Erno Nemecsek! He's very ill. He's got a very high temperature, of 40 degrees. But do come in, he may be happy. - Good afternoon! - Afternoon! Erno! Your friends. I don't have the flag. That's not why we're here. Then why? Feri Ats sent his best regards and told us to say that you should get better! Did he really say this? Feri Ats, himself? Yes, he did. Tell him that ... thank you. I'll tell him. Boka said that ... ... you put off the battle till tomorrow. Is that true? That's true. That's good. Tomorrow I can be there, too. I'll get better by tomorrow, won't I, Mum? If you really want to get better, Erno, you should lie down and tuck yourself in. And I ... brought these things back to you. Don't be angry with me and my brother. But I haven't been angry with you. I haven't been angry indeed. I was just a bit frightened. You're such good boys that you love my little son so much. You're so good to him. Thank you. For this you'll get a cup of hot chocolate now. Thank you very much, but we don't deserve that chocolate for this. Come on! Excuse me, I'm Szabo from the 7th form, I'd like to join you in ... - Could you get a rope? - Yes, and what's more! Should be enough for a small army. Well, this is my brother and my friend. So we would like to join you in ... - Very kind of you, but sorry, it's impossible... - Boka! Boka! Boka! The beam works perfectly. - Have you practised how to use it? - Absolutely! Don't hurry, it could get stuck. That's very important! Will be all right, don't worry! Others have already come here, but it doesn't work. You know, the Plot is our business, we have to defend it. Csonakos, Barabas! You'll have to take care of the Pasztor boys. Laddie! Everything is up to your performance. You'll have to pretend running. - That's absolutely clear! - Yes, clear, but when will we start running? When you hear the horn. We've already gone over it. Your task is to listen to the horn and if you can hear it, run! I don't understand. It's past three p.m. You should make the bombs with water and honey, laddies! Sand sticks better. The secret of a good bomb is water with honey. Yet, give me one! There you are! 6 pennies, laddie. Come and take it, there are some bottles left. They're coming! They're here! Oh dear, Csele! It will be an exciting afternoon! I can see Feri Ats! Troop, attention! Right turn! There's Ats, Szebenics next to him. He's holding our flag! I see, the Pasztor boys are moving to the Maria Street! They said that the attack will be from two directions. But look at that guy! That's amazing! That's smashing! Feri Ats and the others can't even see them! I just can't see where it ends. Among the barrels. That's true but the other end. It bends at the back as if it went under the building. The hell, you're right! Szabo! Come on, the Pasztor boys are coming! They look fabulous, don't they? They play a sure game, old chap! Stop! Right turn! Blow it! How long we do this, young sir? What's that? What's going on here?! They want to get on their nerves! They're doing it so well! Forward! Forward! Jeessus! Oh dear! Attack! Follow me! Come on, laddies, come here! Attack! Don't care for ... Bravo! What's going on? Ats' troop is not coming! Listen, they're expecting that our whole group will be busy fighting the Pasztor boys! So that they can get us between two fires. But sure they won't! Blow it, Csele! Sound the horn! Retreat! Stay here! If Ats's troop attacks, you will alert immediately! Csonakos, move back! Attack them face to face! Bombs! Give them some bombs! Go, Csengey! Ready, Csengey! I think we can get ready. Soon we'll get the alert. The Pasztor boys pressed them in among the piles. There they'll be beaten to a jelly. How can they sit there so peacefully? I don't understand. Look! They're coming back there! It's just stunning! Would you have thought this of Boka? Heave-ho! We should start from a farther point! This door is strong. Come on, again! What was that...? That was great! Soon it will be your turn! - Follow them! - Why is it locked? Laddie, cook their geese and come out! Can't you hear me? Let only one come out at a time, only one! Idiots! The flag! The flag must be taken away! Attack for the flag! Look out, Kemenes! It won't hurt if you're a good boy! Go to hell! Wendauer! Wendauer! Yes, sir! Sound the horn! Kemenes! One more, Kemenes! Pasztor! Boka! If you're done, Boka, just throw him down! We're here! Boka, can't you hear me? Turn him over! Csonakos, look out! Are you looking for the flag, laddie? Do you admit that I defeated you? I do. Take him away. Csonakos! Watch out! Don't get rough! What's up, Kemenes? So many at a time? You, skunk! You've already been defeated by a fall! Would you like to start again? - Hold on, Csonakos! - Hold him down, Csonakos! His shoulders are almost down! Boka! Get him! Boka, watch out! Feri Ats, behind you ... Erno, my son! Go back to bed! Come here! Come here... Gee, Mom! What do you do here at the Plot? Come on, lie down! You silly boy! You shouldn't do things like that! You might get worse. Wow ... It's so very hot in here, Mom! Oh, how good! How good this is! I've cooked a tasty soup with caraway seeds for this little boy. Come on, Mrs Nemecsek, take it for him! I'm coming. Maybe he can fall asleep ... ..at last. He was awake all night. He was delirious all the time. Boka... Haven't I just told you? Boka... Do I waste my breath? Attack! You're great, Kolnay! If only I knew where the Pasztor boys are! Strike his head, no more mr nice guy! They're retreating, sound the horn! Retreat! Thank you, Jano! Boys! Let Ats go through! Blow it! Follow him! Attack! Only his head, boys! Come on, laddie, come on! We are surrounded! - Hold on, Csonakos! - Turn him over! Bring it on, Csonakos! Turn him over, at last! Can't you hear me? - Just a little bit more! - All right! All right! That's it! Push him down! Go on, Csonakos, now you're the stronger one! Look out, Csonakos, the flag! Care about the flag! He wants to take the flag away! He's alive, he's all right! ... open it! Feri Ats, open it! Feri Ats, open it! Feri Ats ... Boys, come here to the hut! To the hut! We're going to set them free. Feri Ats! What are you doing? So you also ... ... want to cheat? Hold on! Keep them back! Keep their pushing back! Bring some water! We won! We won! Feri Ats, where are you, can't you hear me? Not so fast, laddie, not so fast! Why don't you want to open it? Leave your weapons in there. You can leave one by one. What happened? Do you feel better? Yes, I do. Does anything hurt? No. Did we win? Yes, we did. And that's also due to you. If you didn't attack Feri Ats ... Well.. then... - Adjutant! - Yes, sir! Sound the horn! Gosh, they... Troop, attention! Herewith the Paul Street troop expresses its thanks to private soldier, Erno Nemecsek. Salute! Three cheers for our General, for Erno Nemecsek! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Me... general? Boka! You can't be serious! It's a joke, Boka! He doesn't really mean it, boys! Me... general? He was awake all night. He was delirious all the time. How is he? He's unconscious. What time is it? Almost ten. Is he very ill? Very. The doctor is going to see him this evening again. We are waiting for him, too. You arranged it with Mr Csetneky for today, didn't you? What did he say, when was he about to come? Towards evening. You can fret and fume about it, great snuff. La-la-la... Listen... He's singing... Maybe he's getting better! He's singing in his sleep! Gosh, Boka... Are you still here? Still? But I've just arrived. I see... Did you see the hurdy-gurdy? What hurdy-gurdy? Then you didn't see it. If you saw it, you would know. A beautiful hurdy-gurdy. Professor Ratz was crazy about it. So beautiful. Snuff... That must be the doctor. Thanks for bringing my stripes! Be serious, you deserve it! Now you're a general! The Putty Club ... how it will protest. You know... it wasn't very kind of them to write my name with small letters... as a traitor ... They're going to apologize. I'll believe it when I see it. I want to go to the Plot! - Now? - Now. They think that I'm ill. Though I feel much better now! I want to go to the Plot! It's a bit too early, Erno! I want to blow the horn! Wait, you shouldn't be moving about! You'd better take care of yourself. Boka! Please, could you get these stones off me? What stones? Can't you see them? So many stones... They're always putting them on me. They keep bringing them. There's always a heap on me by evening. Boka, they're so heavy! Could you possibly get them off? Won't you get them off? Right away. I'll come back in a minute. I have to give up my place. The doctor is here. I see.. But you'll come back, won't you! I will. Honestly? Honestly. All right then. Then you won't cheat me. I'm certainly not going! Barabas should go first! Why Barabas? You're the leader of the deputation! Well, that's true... I'm the leader indeed. Well, then ... Shall I knock? Psst! What do you want? The whole Putty Club is here. So and... We've brought him a honorary document. We wrote with red that ... the Club apologized. And that we entered his name into the Big Book in block letters. The Big Book is also here. Couldn't you come earlier? Why? The doctor is here right now. Well, at most we'll wait. It took a lot of time to decide who the leader of the deputation should be. And it took half an hour to elect Weisz. - Leave me some place, Barabas! - Sorry, I took this seat first! I see, but I may also sit down. Leave me alone! One chair is enough for one person. - Or even two! - But not on this one! Well, it must be enough! - It's not! - It is! Shut up! I'm really sorry, Mr Nemecsek ... I'm really sorry, and I sympathize with you. I did my best as far as possible, but ... It was bound to happen. But you know well, this was only to be expected since yesterday. I know. Certainly. Yes. HONORARY DOCUUMENT There is a note in the Big Book of the Putty Collector's Club saying: erno nemecsek A TRAITOR!!! From now on this shaming note is invalid, it was a mistake, so the Club expresses its sympathy NEMECSEK ERNO IS THE HERO OF THE PLOT! This Honorary Document is the official record of the Club's apology. It's because he went into the lake? Three times. He had already been ill when Feri Ats sent him to bathe. Yes, he'd been coughing very badly by then. That's crazy. Isn't that crazy? Yes, it is. Look, the way the old doc walks! He walks like that, really! Look! Wendauer's trumphet. It was Csonakos who put sand in it. That's stupid. Maybe it will work some day. We beatung thim! We beatung! Throwung! Chasung away! We did. Do you know what happened, Jano? What? Nemecsek died. Which is Nemecsek? That little blonde one. I see... Well, now it will be a little bit good again. What should we do with these, young sir? We'll put them away. What's this stuff, Jano? This? This belongs to Mr Engineer. What engineer? The bulding engineer. Building engineer? What does he want here, Jano? Well, they are going to build! On Munday workers come, they dig up the plot, they make cellar, foundation, big house! They make a four-storey house here. I'm really sorry, Boka, but I have to go now. You know, if I don't get home in time, then ... All right. Go. Wait, I'm going that way, too. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Well, we're going, too, aren't we? Sure. Are you coming, Boka? Yes. I certainly go. You just go, I'll join you. Come on. Gosh, there's so much Latin homework for tomorrow! Oh dear, so much! Easy for you, you were questioned yesterday. That doesn't mean anything. He may call me. - He doesn't pick on you. - But he picks on you, eh? - Sure he does! - Forget it. Tell me, why are you always teasing me, Barabas?
