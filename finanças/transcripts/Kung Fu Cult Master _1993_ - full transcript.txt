There was a legend, that, Kwok Ching and his wife Wong Yung got the sword of Yeung Guo. They mixed it with fine gold and made two swords. One is called Tao-lung and the other named Yee-tin. They also wrote all they've learnt together with Yue-fei's tactics and the secret of the most powerful Kung Fu scroll, the Lunar Secret was hidden inside the swords. Whoever got it, whoever could rule the world of martial arts. The supreme of the world of martial arts... Kung Fu Master Thus, no matter evil or virtuous, in order to get these two weapons numerous fights were caused... Two groups were thus formed. One was headed by Shaolin. Shaolin. Wu-tong. Ngo-mei. Kun-lun. Hung-fling- Hwa-shan. Their opponent was the Fire Sect which was came from Persia. They called themselves the Ming Sect. But, they were named the Evil Sect by others. They were so mysterious and were always against the Yuan Dynasty. Ming Sect always caused riots against the government. Their headquarters were located at the Bright Summit. Four branch-leaders - Purple, White, Golden and Green were all powerful. They were: Queen of Purple Dragon. King of White Eagle. King of Golden Lion. And King of Green Bat. Two groups were strongly against each others. Their fellows couldn't make friends with each other. Otherwise, they could be killed. Chang Tsui-san, the 5th student of Chang San-fung was a righteous and hero, disregarded the unreasonable rules and fell in love with Yan So-so, the daughter of King of White Eagle. He even make friend and be brothers with Tse Shun, King of Golden Lion. Shing Kwun, King of Golden Lion's master in order to help Yuan's government to destroy Ming Sect, he killed Tse Shun's family. Tse Shun risked his life to seize the To-lung Sword to take revenge for his family, end up, he killed many innocent lives. Go! Tsui-shan and So-so didn't want others to know Tse's whereabouts, so they went to a nobody-land - Ice and Fire Island and live in seclusion. Although he got the sword, Tse Shun couldn't get the secret of the To-lung Sword, until the one hundredth birthday of Chang San-fung. Tsui-san brought his wife and his son Mo-kei to visit his master. Crab in sugar candy. I want it. - Please give me one. - Alright. Pick yourself. Mo-kei, enjoy it. Good boy. - Thank you mom. - Let's go. - Is it yummy? - Yes. I asked you not to get down. This is about Wu Tong Mountain. I think it doesn't matter. It's hard to tell. For To-lung Sword, they can do whatever in mind. Dad, why do they want Godfather's To-lung Sword? I have told you many times. Don't mention your Godfather's name, don't you remember? I won't do that again. Remember no matter who asks about your Godfather, no matter how they push you, don't say a word about Godfather. Yes. Dad said that we can't betray our friends, or it will be non-righteous. Good boy. I think Master will like you. Is Grand-master kind? He is the kindest one among the kindest. Chang Tsui-san... It hurts. It's "The Cry from Jinx", it will affect one's mind. Resist it with your inner power. Or, you will hypnotize and lose your mind. Who are you? Please show up. Jinx's palm? Mo-kei. Are you the notorious "Jinxs"? Chang, if you want your son back, tell us where the King of Golden Lion is. Stop dreaming. If we hit your son with our "Jinx's Palm", what do you think? How dare you? The kid is innocent. Why do you ill treat this kid? If you let him go, Wu-tong and the Ming Sect will appreciate so much. Are you threatening me with Wu-tong and Ming Sect? Even that old jerk Chang San-fung is here, I won't be scared. Don't you? Master... I, Chang San-fung, beg you to let the boy go. I see, the famous Chang San-fung is ust a fatty. I am all eyed. Right, my name is being exaggerated. It's not a big deal. Fatty, if you are afraid of my "Jinx's Palm", ask your student to tell us where Tse Shun is. Right. It is because of one girl. Tsui-san, told them then. Master, Tse Shun is my buddy. If I betray him, I am not righteous and not loyal to my buddy. Right, how can you be non-righteous? How can you face others then? Please give us face then. Old bluffer, step aside if you are afraid to death. Or you will die on your 100th birthday. It's useless to sigh. You assholes, I think that I shouldn't quarrel or get angry on my 100th birthday. You two forced me to break my rule. I must teach you a good lesson. Brother. If you hit him once, I'll hit him 100 times then. Hubby, your master is so hot tempered. He is always hot tempered. Okay, let's release the hostages together. Okay, I don't think you would pull off a shunt. One two three. Mo-kei. Mo-kei. - Watch out. - Let's go. Jinx's Palm? Mo-kei. Take Mo-kei to Shaolin... no... Take him to Wu-tong. I will get the antidote from that two guy. Don't! If we go on like this, Mo-kei will be killed. Cut. Mo-kei. Mo-kei. Brother, how is he? Jinx's Palm is so powerful. I think, we have to wait for Master's antidote. How is Mo-kei... Mom I feel pain! Don't panic, Mo-kei! Here are some candies. Eat one and taste it if you feel pain. So you won't feel pain anymore, got that? Uncles, The representatives of Shaolin, Ngo-mei, Hung-tung, Wah-shan and Kun-lun are approaching here. They seems to come celebrating Master's birthday, in fact, they want Uncle Chang to tell where King of Golden Lion is. Today is the birthday of my master. He asked us not to make any grand celebration so he may enjoy a peaceful birthday. We appreciate your visit and we will express our thanks later. Please go back. We dare not to disturb Master Chang but he has to hand out Chang Tsui-san and Yan So-so and tell us where is the King of Golden Lion. Then, we will leave at once. Mastress No-mercy, where do you think it is? How dare you get anyone you wish? In order to take revenge for the victims killed by Evil Sect. We want to get Tse Shun by any means. If you don't hand us the wanted. I'll fight with you then. I've heard that you are great in Kung Fu. I, Sung Yuen-kiu, would like to offend you now. Chang Tsui-san, if you won't come out, your seniors will be killed. Stop! Mastress No-mercy, don't go too far. You are willing to show up with your bitch! Where is King of Golden Lion? I won't tell you my buddy's whereabouts. You deserve it. You want to be friend with that murderer. I will wake you up. Bitch... You? Damn nun... You? Watch my powerful Yee-tim Sword! It's no big deal. If your master Kwok Shang were not my best friend, I wouldn't give you face today. There will only be bad luck to the world if Yee-tin Sword is with you. I will keep this sword for you're your master for 7 years. 7 years later, ask a better student to collect it back. Chang San-fung, how dare you protect your sinful student? If we attack you together, I don't think you can kill all of us. When you are exhausted, you will be in deep shit too. How dare you? Are you threatening me? Master, I will be the one wholly responsible for this matter. They come for me only. Let me settle by myself. Okay! You may settle by yourself. About fighting, I have never been scared. Are you threatening me? Seniors if you want me to tell my brother's whereabouts. In fact, you want his sword and be the supreme only. I will never betray my friend. But I don't wanna my master to risk his life with you at his old age. Well, I will give you an answer now. Tsui-san... Dad! Dad! Dad! Why do you kill yourself? Mom Mom! Why did Dad do so? Mo-kei, recognize each face. Remember them one by one. You have to remember all their faces. Each of them is stained with your Dad's blood. Did they push Dad to death? You have to take revenge for your Dad. Don't let them escape. Madam Yan, we feel sorry for the death of your husband. Now, you are the only one who knows where Tse Shun is. Master Hung Man, come here, I will tell you. But will you let my son and me to go? Monks don't take their words back. Okay, I will tell you only. Madam, can you make it clear? Master, King of Golden Lion is living there. Wish you to get the Sword soon. - Madam... - Where is he? - She didn't tell. - You wanna get the Sword alone! Mom. Mo-kei, mom cheated them. See, how powerful is my cheating skill! Remember, don't ever trust any woman. More beautiful the woman is, more capable is she to tell lies. Mom. We've to take revenge for 5 brothers. Let's forget this, first of all, to save Mo-kei. Mo-kei... Master. You have terrific inner power. So what? In these years, I've never got a way to cure you from feeling cold. If not the Shaolin monk jumped from here, he could have cured you with his "Great Solar Stance". Great Solar Stance? Great Solar Stance is the mysterious kung fu of Shaolin. It's as powerful as the "Great Lunar Stance". The Scroll has been lost in Shaolin for 300 years. Accidentally, a cooking monk in Shaolin discovered it inside a sutra. After he learnt the kung-fu, he defeated over 30 monks and then escaped. He even came to challenge me. Chang, you are really great. Great Solar Stance can make you famous in this world of martial arts. I think, you are not virgin before practising such kung-fu. Otherwise, I couldn't have defeated you. I can't imagine this kind of kung-fu isn't invincible. Why should I try so hard to practise then? Chang San-fung, see you. Nuts. If he wasn't dead, his kung-fu would have saved you. My dear boy, no matter how, you'd be virgin to practise kung-fu. So, your kung-fu would be more powerful. Don't think I am a hundred years' old granny. My dick erects every morning. What? Why isn't mine do the same? You are weak. Master. What's the matter, Ching-su? 7 years passed. Ngo-mai's Master No-mercy sent her student Chow Chi-yu here, to get back their Yee-tin Sword. Chow Chi-yu? How are you, Master Chang? Is No-mercy's temper better? She's studied Buddhism recently, she has great improvement. You are a polite girl, it's lucky for her to get such good student. Mo-kei, return the Yee-tin Sword to her. Brother Mo-kei, are you the son of Mr. Chang Tsui-san? I... Yes, Brother Mo-kei is the orphan left by uncle. lam Sung Ching-su. My dad is the eldest brother of "Wu-tong seven heroes". Thank you brother Mo-kei. Chi-yu, why not stay here for few days? Let my student Yen-kiu teach you our sword stance as present. Thank you Master Chang. Brother Mo-kei. Are you supervising them? Master Chang loves you so much, I think you will be his successor for sure. Don't worry, Mo-kei can't practise Kung-fu, we will take care of him. Sister Chi-yu, why don't you guys practise together? He was hurt by "Jinx's Palm" 8 years ago. He can't practise Kung-fu anymore. Dad. Ching-su, Master wants to practise Tai-chi Sword for three months. We have to stay with him in a secret cell. In these three months, you've to take care of everything in Wu-tong. Thank you, Dad. Ching-su, you have to work hard. In the 3rd generation of Wu-tong, Mo-kei can't practise Kung-fu. You are the only one that we have to depend on. Master Chang made one hundred "Heart Strangthening Pills". You give one pill per night to Mo-kei so it can stop him from feeling cold. Ching-su will take good care of Mo-kei. What are you doing? Go... go. Brother Mo-kei, what happened? Someone peeped at you. Really? They are so bad. I am so scared. They have all gone. lam still scared. Why not come and accompany me? I know you would not accompany me. Let me accompany you. I know you care me most. Do you feel hot? - No. - You are sweating. How dare you! Chang Mo-kei, don't you think you are a lady-killer? Brother Ching-su, will there be any accident? Don't worry, I am in-charge now. You Jinx, you dragged your parents to death. You only know how to flatter Master Chang. So he passes you his inner energy to keep you away from coldness. If he passed me his inner energy I'd have been top graded Kung-fu master. Your mom is a jinx. You can insult me, but not my mom. I just wonder you are the blood of my uncle or not. Maybe you are a son of a bitch! Go to hell! Brother Ching-su. Catch him, I wanna chop his hand off. I see, Wu-tong is not heroic at all! My friend, who are you? Friend? I am not your friend. Get dressed. Bitch! Come down if you have guts. Wu-tong's kung-fu is nothing special. The kung-fu of Ming Sect is much more powerful. Sister Chi-yu, attack her with your Yee-tin Sword. You bitch. Yee-tin Sword is really in Wu-tong. Aren't you leaving? Watch out, don't let the dogs of Wu-tong kill you. I don't allow you to insult Wu-tong. You must be insane. I will chat with you after the fight. Bitch, I will let you see how powerful my sword is. Thank you! I come for this sword indeed. I want to break this unbreakable "Cold-chain". Wu-tong Sword Stance. Here I go! Escape. Your kung-fu is so bad. Forget about me, go now. They would kill you if they catch you up. Kidding, you bring me to this dead end? Chang, you allied with the Evil Sect and mess our temple. Now I'll exile you with the name of Acting In-charge of Wu-tong. - Wu-tong students have my order. - Yes. - Kill with no mercy. - Yes. Miss, I've cragged you down. Call me Siu Chiu. How dare you seduce man in such critical moment? Where can you go? Why do you loose your hands without any notice? For I touched yours... Dumb-bell, you must be educated by your dad. My dad died many years ago. You called Chang Mo-kei. Is your dad Chang Tsui-san? - Mr. Chang, I am your maid Siu Chiu. - Get up first. Siu Chiu is the maid of King of White Eagle. Because I offended King of White Eagle, he lock me up. I went into fugitive. I've heard Yee Tin Sword is in Wu-tong I want to make use of it. Luckily I met you and you saved my life. Get up first. I am not your master. You touched me again. You are the grandson of King of White Eagle. So I have to greet you Mister. In fact, I haven't seen my grandfather since birth. What kind of noise is it? Monster? Go... - This way. - That way. I can't imagine there would be visitors for me. You are... I am the soul of hell. Are you the student of Wu-tong? lam Chang Mo-kei. I haven't eaten human flesh for a long time. Chang San-fung made me suffer here. It's not too much to eat one of his student, right? Are you the cooking monk? You remember me? The girl behind you is so attractive. She must be more delicious than you. She isn't student of Wu-tong, just come and eat me! You are heroic too! Senior... Mister...Mister Chang, how are you? It's cold... What have you done to him? Kidding! He has already been seriously injured. Who hurt you? I was hit by the "Jinx's Palm" 8 years ago. Nothing can cure it. It must be Master Chang passes you inner energy in these years. He loves you so much. Senior, I know you can cure him. I beg you to cure him. My "Great Solar Stance" is the only solution. But why should I cure Chang's people? Chang Mo-kei, unless you scold your Master Chang as asshole, I will teach you "Great Solar Stance" to cure you from coldness. Impossible. You don't save him, that's okay, why did you hit him? Just scold Chang as "Shame-less asshole" for three times. Then you will free from this kind of suffer forever. You will also have invincible power. This is a piece of cake. Follow me, Chang is a shameless asshole... Shameless asshole... is you. Okay! I will see how can you get through this night. Mister... - It's cold. - Very cold? Mister how are you? - It's cold. - Still very cold? It's cold. It's cold. Will it be warmer? I'm still alive. I'm still alive. Mister are you alright? Siu Chiu. You were lucky last night. You will ice-cold two or three times a day. If no one use the inner energy to keep your life. You will die. You hard-hearted. Chang Mo-kei, if you don't learn my "Great Solar Stance", you will suffer coldness for the rest of your life. Leave Wu-tong, and be my student. Master Chang is so nice to me, I can't do that. You are sick. Why do you push him to learn your kung-fu? 1 O years ago, I was defeated by Chang San-fung. I am so furious. I want my student to be superior than any of his student. Why don't you teach me? If a woman practise "Great Solar Stance", one year later, she will have flat chest, with hairy arms and legs, with beard and man's voice. Do you want it? Forget it. Mister, his backbone is broken, he moves with that ball. Why not promise him now? After learning his kung-fu, then we can take our words back. Wu-tong student is always righteous and virtuous! I am a Wu-tong student... but he forces me to study his kung-fu, there must be a trick. I won't learn any of it. I don't think you can push me to get your kung-fu. Can't I? Siu Chiu. Let me help you. I don't allow you to do so. Great Sun appears, the blood flows backward. Don't press my head to your ass. Air from belly goes through the whole body. It's breaking. Blood Sea. Top of the back. Solar pool. Door of life. Ken-suk... Chang, you have the 1st level of the Great Solar Stance. You have my kung-fu now. You can never get rid of it. You... I'll push you to learn the 2nd level. Unless you die, or you are betraying Wu-tong. I am useless to let that evil bitch hit Mo-kei down the cliff. I was late. I could only kill the bitch, but couldn't save Mo-kei. Please kill me, as compensation to Uncle Chang. Okay, I will kill you now. Yuen-kiu, even you kill him, you can't save Mo-kei instead. It's useless to kill him. Brother Ching-su tried his best. Mo-kei is such a poor boy. Death may be a release to him. Shaolin invite us to launch a raid to Bright Summit. We'd maintain peace and righteousness of the world of martial arts. Yuen-kiu, lead your juniors, ching-su and chi-yu to go with you. Yes, master. The 9th level "Great Solar in the Sky" Chang, you have got all stance from "Great Solar Scroll". From now on, you are full of mysterious and powerful energy. Your wound is cured too. From now on, it's hard for you to get hurt or get killed. Master, you made it? Thank you Master. Aren't you unwilling to learn my kung-fu? It should be a suffering instead. I know you didn't mean to teach me. You just let me lose face of my master. So I just tricked you to teach me your kung-fu. I have to take revenge for my parents, I wish to learn it most. You're cunning. Not only pretty women are not trustworthy, you can't even trust those seem to be kind-hearted! I wanna kill you. I have the same kung-fu as you have. How can you kill me? Watch out, he is very powerful. Senior, please forgive me. You cured me by your kung-fu. Thank you for your lessons. You cunning guy. If I can make my revenge, I will come back to save you. You will die terribly. Let's wait and see who will die first. Let's go. See how long will you two get together. You will not happy ending. I've made it. Shaolin, Ngo-mei, Hung-tung, Kwun-lun and Wah-shan, all of you are stained with the blood of my parents. I want you to repay. You look horrible. If you were me, you kept every hatred inside your heart for 8 years. To be bullied and insulted all the time. When you have a chance to release, you'll just like what I am doing now. Are you going back to Wu-tong? Sung Ching-su is the only son of my uncle. I can't take revenge to him, no way. I won't go back to Wu-tong. With the help of my "Great Solar Stance", I can go everywhere. I will go to Bright Summit to see my Grandfather, and will beg him to unlock you. Thank you. We risked our lives together. Don't call me Mister anymore. I love to serve you. Will you let me serve you then? You are so nice to me, I will always remember it. Now you are so powerful, I think you will attract many girls. Then, you will forget me soon. Once there is sun, I won't let you leave me. Mister. Mister, there are candies for sale. These were the last thing that my mom brought me. After I was hit by "Jinx's Palm", she gave me three candies. She asked me to eat one when I feel pain. When they died, you ate the first one, right? I dried these two. So I've to keep it properly. - Take us some wine and food. - Yes. Quick! The 6 schools of martial arts are launching a raid to the Bright Summit. I am sure they will destroy the Evil Sect. If we are late, we will miss the great moment. So what if we can catch them? It means more people will be sent to hell only. There are 4 branch leaders and the "invincible 5 Elements Flag". Don't you think a small potato like you can destroy them? How ignorant are you! She must be somebody in the Evil Sect. Arrest her. Yes! Let's hide up first. You're putting a quart into a pint pot! Is she somebody in the Ming Sect? I've never seen her there before. Let's deal about the raid to Bright Summit. I will try my best. Do you know them? Of course, they hit me with "Jinx's Palm" 8 years ago. Don't panic. Many powerful kung-fu masters are here, we can't compete with them. - Mr. Deer. - How are you? Master, we all depend on you. Please send my regards to His Majesty, see you. Who is hiding? Come out! What are you doing here? Kid, what are you looking at? He seems to be familiar to us. Forget it, a couple is enjoying chatting here. Let's I just wanna... Luckily you didn't move, see... This guy must be somebody. Even Deer Man and Crane Man seem to be his fellows. Guy? This is a woman. Woman? She looks like my mom. She is pretty, so you said she looks like your mom. You look like my mom now. Still kidding? The Bright Summit is surrounded by the 6 schools. Let's hurry there. The Evil Sect is well prepared. The "5 Elements Flags" are all in position. Even Wai at-siu, King of Green Bat has come back to help. Even though he is against King of White Eagle. If Queen of Purple Dragon and King of Golden Lion are back, it'll be difficult for us to deal with. If King of Golden Lion is back, that's prefect. We can seize his To Lung Sword. Do you want my Yee-tin Sword too? That's what I want. I dare not to. Queen of Purple Dragon is the Holy Lady of Persia's Ming Sect. She's disappeared for many years. It's believed that she went to Persia. After a severe fight, King of Golden Lion were Blind. It's not difficult to handle him. But King of White Eagle and King of Green Bat are difficult to handle. Uncle, I have an idea. Go ahead. King of White Eagle has a grandson. He is the son of Chang sui-san. He is called Chang Mo-kei. He died few months ago. King of White Eagle doesn't know it. An old man if he meet his grandson again, he will be very happy. If his grandson attacks suddenly, it is sure that he will have great chance to kill him. Great idea. So we can kill King of White Eagle and King of Green Bat easily and rob all the money of them. We are from decent schools of martial arts, how can we do so? You are using my passed nephew. I don't agree to do so. Isn't it good? We just wanna help the poor people only. I agree with Master Yuen-chun. You asked someone to act as Chang Mo-kei. Who is the most suitable person then? The son of Mr. Sung is the best choice. I won't allow our Wu-tong student to do such thing. You cunning bastards are discussing evil traps. Watch out for being hit by thunder! Bat's down. It's King of Green Bat, Wai Yat-siu. Wai, let my wife go. Your wife is so fat, it's no big deal for me to suck her blood. Damn it! No-mercy, you killed my wife. If anyone is bitten by Wai Yat-siu, one will lose his mind and obey Wai only. If I don't kill your wife, we will have one more enemy. You You can't complete with her. Wai doesn't know how powerful is Yee-tin Sword. He used Mrs. Ho to be shield. I believed that he is hurt by the energy of my sword. Your Highness. Have the 6 schools arrived the hill side? They have all arrived, your Highness. Set the "5 elements position". When they come halfway, I want half of them to die. Yes. I am back. Your Highness. Bat, I am glad you come to help, that means, you really love our sect. Old man, I've got some information. By the way, I fought with No-mercy. Her Yee-tin Sword is really powerful. Are you alright? Of course, I'll be alright. Set the position now. Someone who claims himself the grandson of King of White Eagle, Chang Mo-kei, just kill him without a warning. Yes. What did you say? My grandson? They'll send someone to act as your grandson to assassinate you. If our "Holy Fire Tablet" is still here, I won't scare her Yee-tin Sword. Bullshit! If our Master Yeung didn't disappear, with his "Magic Stance", he would have killed them easily. It hurts. Are you hurt? Of course. But I can't lose my face in front of them. Never mind, I'll cure you by my inner power. It's useless, you've to suck the position of the wound. - No problem. - Really? Yes, I didn't take my words back. What a good buddy. Look, the wound is onto my ass. It's alright if you don't suck, but you shouldn't kick me! So many people. They don't seem to be the man from Ming Sect. Why are there so many flags? This is the code of our Sect. They have rushed into the forbidden zone of the 5 Elements Flag. 5 Elements Flag? Don't retreat! We are from decent schools, we can't cowards. If someone coward, someone will be killed. - You are right... - You go first. Chi-yu, give me my Yee-tin Sword. Yes, Master. Go. Let's chase. Pals, I am Siu-chiu, the maid of King of White Eagle. This is the grandson of King of White Eagle, Mr. Chang Mo-kei. You are Chang Mo-kei? Yes, I am. By the order of King of White Eagle: Who claims to be Chang Mo-kei, whoever should be killed. Kill him. Go. - Rush over there. - Hey! lam Chang Mo-kei. Kill! You even don't know who is your enemy, you deserve to be beaten. Great Solar Stance. Bravo! Hero, which school do you come from? Master, he is Chang Mo-kei. He is the son of Chang Tsui-san? Why is he so powerful? Where are you taking me to? - This is the forbidden zone of Ming Sect. - What? Forbidden zone? Shall we go into? Other than the master of our sect can enter before his death. If he dies outside, the people who carry his corpse should commit suicide in here. How about you? lam a maid, King of White Eagle doesn't let me join the sect. Don't go. Go. Damn it, if you move one more step, I will make you dead terrible. I would be terrible if I stay here, you fool. Mister, let's go. - Chase them! - Go! Commander, what'll we do? These are graves of our ex-masters. There are many traps inside. If we enter, they will be killed for sure. Let's go back to help. What's the matter? I am scared. Don't be afraid, look! They are all skulls. I think they were the one who carried the corpse, as you said. Why don't we go out? We are surrounded by the Flag Soldiers. So many men outside, I don't want to hurt my grandfather's men with my kung-fu. I thank, we have no choice but to go forward. I know there is a road to get to the Bright Summit. How do you know that much since you are only the maid of King of White Eagle? I heard it, thus I know it. My grandfather locked you with such heavy chain. There must be some reasons. Who are you? Don't cheat me! Don't you trust me? T just want to know the truth. Mister, I have made an oath, I can't tell anybody. But I promise, I didn't mean to hurt your grandfather and I will never hurt you. Please let me keep some secret. Will you? I promise, I will tell you when it's the time. Okay, let's talk later. There are some footprints on the ground. Yeung Ting-tin, you are the master of the Evil Sect, but so what? Even you took away my lover, so what? Can't imagine you would die here. I, Shing Kwun, am now using the 6 schools to destroy your Evil Sect. I also want to take away your "Magic Stance" too. Then, I will be invincible and to be the Pope of Yuan Dynasty. Even I don't have the To-lung Sword. I can still be the Supreme of the world of martial arts. The ex-master of Ming Sect disappeared for over 20 years. In fact, he died right here. This may be Shing Kwun, the foe of my Godfather. I see, he became the dog of Yuan Government. He set a variance between the 6 schools and Ming Sect. That's why he dragged my Godfather's family to death. Who? Chang Mo-kei. Didn't you die? What's the enmity between you and Ming Sect? What's the enmity between you and my dad? Why did you drag them like this? Yeung Ting-tin took my lover from me. I had adultery with his wife for 3 years. At last, he discovered that. That's why he got mad. But he still wanted to kill me. My lover wanted to cover me, so she committed suicide. I stayed 20 years in Shaolin as undercover. I just wait for this chance to destroy Ming Sect. You seduced his wife and ruined his Evil Sect. And you claimed yourself reasonable. What a shame! No matter it's right or wrong, it's not your turn to criticize me. Chang Mo-kei, I am sending you to see your parents. Get lost. What kind of kung-fu it is? Great Solar Stance. I can't imagine I would be defeated by you. Chang Tsui-san had a secret indeed. What is it? Shit! Get away, I try to break it with my "Great Solar Stance". Mister. Don't use "Great Solar Stance" anymore. I am afraid that it would collapse. Are we waiting for death then? We've to find another exit. There are some words. Those who come into this cell. Should bow to the skeleton or the soul will give you trouble. We are going to die, we'll be souls too. We don't need to scared. Maybe we will be saved. We should respect the dead, come and bow. Master Yeung, we are forced to disturb you. If we have a chance to get out. We will revenge for you, to kill Shing Kwun. Please bless us. - What are these words? - It's the Persia language. - Can you read it? - Sure. After bowing to me, You will have my "Magic Stance". After you learnt it, you can push the stone open and reach Bright Summit. Mister, the "Magic Stance" is written on the rocks. Master Yeung was really wise. He knew Shing Kwun wouldn't bow to him so he designed such trap. Practise now, then we may get out. But it's not right to steal Ming Sect's kung-fu. It's written that, after you've learnt it, you should pass a message on behalf of Master Yeung - ask King of Golden Lion to be his successor. The "Magic Scroll" should be kept by him too. Then, get the "Holy Fire Tablet" from Persia's Ming Sect. He wanted your Godfather to be his successor. Since you are his godson, it doesn't matter to learn his kung-fu. But, how long should it take? It's written that... It takes 30 years for ordinary people. For those great kung-fu masters, it just take 6 hours. I have the base of "Great Solar Stance", I just need 6 hours. Go ahead then. King of Green Bat, you are hurt. Don't waste it! Where are the women? Over there. Do you want me to suck all your blood? - We are the red cross. - We come to save. He is bleeding. Beat him. If I were not hurt seriously, I would have kill you. Old buffer, I have stopped the bleeding for you. King of White Eagle, you are really something. We break even. Dad, he is hurt. Why don't you kill him? He fought against five, instead, he won. If we take such chance, how can we claim ourselves heroes? Stop! What's the matter? - You don't attack, - we, Wah-shan School will attack now! I can't imagine... I would be bullied by such jerks. Old bluffer, let's fight together for our beloved sect. The Evil Sect is going to be terminated. Chi-yu, go with your sisters to kill all the people from Evil Sect and extinguish their holy fire. Yes, Master. King of White Eagle, you are a great kung-fu master. Your "Eagle's claws Stance" is no one in the world of martial arts. It's as great as the "Dragon Claws Stance" of Shaolin. You'd better commit suicide. Old bluffer, don't be so impulsive. Listen. I, Chang Mo-kei request you to stop for a while. Mo-kei, aren't you dead? Is he the son of So-so? That's your grandson? Thank you for your concern. Today, the fight between Ming Sect and the 6 schools is all a trap set by Shing Kwun, the master of Tse Shun. Please keep calm and not to fall into his trap. Bull shit! The Evil Sect is so brutal. Wai Yat-siu needs blood for practising, Tse Shun killed many innocent people, they should be killed. Yes, I need blood for practising, but I need chick's blood, pig's blood and my own blood only. On that night, Mrs. Ho of Kwun-lun School was killed by you. I didn't bite her. About manslaughter... Old nun, you killed more than me. You... Shing Kwun serves Yuan, he wants us to kill among ourselves. Mastress, I hope you understand. As you said... Where is Shing Kwun now? He went undercover in Shaolin for over 20 years, he is masked. How dare you frame my Uncle Yuen Chun? Where is Yuen Chun? He sneaked into the graveyard and wanted to steal the "Magic Scroll". Master Yeung was dragged to death by him. Siu Chiu, make it clear. Grandfather, I won't let anybody hurt you. You insulted Shaolin what a big mouth you're having Try my Dragon's Claws Stance. Master, would you let us go if I can defeat you? Deal. So go ahead. This guy is really powerful. If I have 6,000 points He has at least 10,000 points. Dragon's Claws Stance! OK. Terminate my kung-fu now. I just come to stop your fight not to create any more troubles. By the way, I used the kung-fu of Shaolin. It's not an insult at all. Please forgive me. Okay, let's go. Chang Mo-kei, let me challenge you. They pushed my dad to death. Now, they come to slaughter without reasons. I have to take revenge for dad. No way. If I duel with them, it's being trapped by Shing Kwun. I must hold my temper, to be supreme, I can fight with the Gov't. Watch out, you should pay attention to her sword. Right, don't fight with her. Mastress, please go ahead. Magic Stance! Damn you nun. - Siu Chiu. - Yes. Thank you, mister. Brother Mo-kei, in fact I was forced to trap you. Please forgive me. I have never minded that. Please bring this sword to your master. Anybody wants to challenge me again? Chi-yu. Brother. Mister. Don't die... Mister. Don't die... Let's attack them together. lam sure we can kill him. Who dares to take their advantage, Who is going to be Wu-tong's enemy. You are the bastard, let's go. Mister. You can't die, don't leave me. I am protected by "Great Solar Stance", I won't die. But I can't use my kung-fu in this week. Mo-kei, take a good rest. Come back to visit Master Chang if you have time. Since we protect you, we've gone against the other 5 schools. We should leave as soon as possible. Or we will be blamed of being allied with Evil Sect. So what? Who do you think you are? Maybe, we will save your Wu-tong one day. - What are you bull-shitting? - Ching-su. Uncle please bring the Yee-tin Sword to Master Chang. - Don't let No-mercy get it anymore. - Alright. - Mo-kei. - Mister. Go. Take care. Mister. Yan Tin-tsing, Wai Yat-siu and "5 Elements Flags" greet Master Chang. I am not your master. There is a tradition that, whoever uses "Magic Stance" is our master. Our sect has been splitted in all these years. King of Golden Lion and Queen of Purple Dragon left after fighting for the leadership. You saved us. Other than you who is qualified be the master then? But Master Yeung wanted my Godfather to be his successor. Either you or your Godfather is the same. Your Highness. Wah-shan school is coming back with a troop. They want an attack. Damn it, what a bastard! I am Chu Yuen-chang. Now it's emergency that... please instruct us what to do. Since many of you are hurt, we'd better hide up into the graveyard. What do you think? If you are willing to be our master, we will do whatever you instructed. Listen, my followers. Get into the graveyard and hide up first. After we've recovered, we will take our revenge. Bravo, Holy Master... Wonderful! It's really a blessing to have you be our leader. Chu Yuen-chang, I just take the post temporarily for my Godfather. May I be frank... although you keep on refusing to be the Master. I could tell from your eyes you were willing to be the Master. We have so many followers, and we fight with the gov't continuously. We have strong power. Since you want to take revenge, after being the master, you'll have greater chance to take revenge. And you may turnover Yuan Dynasty and to be the King. It's possible. Cut the crap. King of White Eagle is old, King of Green Bat is so care free. They can't assist you much. No matter what, just instruct me, I am willing to help. From your eyes, I can tell you are ambitious. If I make you my right hand, you'll have better success. You're really wise. I do want to be the Master, but the wise people is usually disgusting. - I understand. - Get out of here. - Master, please let us go. - Master, forgive us. Wah-shan is a decent school, but with you jerks. Master, don't kill us. I will tell you a secret. Go ahead. Wu-tong students were attacked by some monks. They seem to be from Shaolin. All the students were caught. Master, we've discovered that Mr. Yan of Wu-tong is hurt. He is ahead. Master Uncle Yan... - Mo-kei. - How are you? We met some Shaolin monks on our way back to Wu-tong. They poisoned us with "Scent" which is the most poisonous thing in this world of martial arts. Those who smell or ate it will lose his kung-fu and energy. Only the special antidote can solve it. I held my breathe, so I could escape. My brothers were all arrested. But later, I met two monks, they were so powerful. I was seriously hurt, they broke all my joints. They are so cruel. Let's go Shaolin and get my uncles back. - It's sold up. - Right. - All hired? - Yes, you may ask them. Go there? OK. Master, all the doctors around are hired and all the herbs are bought by one person. It's strange. It may be done by the Shaolin monks. No, he is living nearby, a place called "Green Willow Villa". Mister, I think they are sure that we need herbs to cure Yan... so they set this trap for us. Green Willow Villa? Green Willow Villa Welcome. My master is long waiting for you. May I know his name? You will know it later. Damn it, do you want to trap us? Speak up, or I will suck your blood. My men's blood is stink. If you want it, I've prepared some fresh blood for you. Why don't you tell us your name? lam Chao Min, a no-body in the world of martial arts. It's meaningless to you. If you are scared, please leave. Watch out! Mister, she is the one we saw in the restaurant. Grandfather, King of Bat, she is the master of "Jinxes". There may be a severe fight later. You are really something. Couldn't think you are so powerful when I saw you last time. I can't imagine you could defeat the 6 schools and be the master of the Ming Sect. What a young hero! May I know why did you buy all herbs and hire all the doctors? I have heard that Mr. Yan was hurt by Shaolin. I am afraid that he would be mis-treated by some poor doctors, so I caught all the poor doctors here. Instead, I've prepared the "Black Jade Paster" for him. Mister. We are not friends, why do you help us? We make friends with heroes is always the practice of our Yuan Gov't. You are the number one kung-fu master in the world, this doesn't mean anything. The Black Jade Paster is the most wonderful medicine in the world. How can she give us that easily? You are Manchurian. My dad is King of Yue-yang. Shaolin is so foolish to challenge you. We will help you to terminate them. Mister, is it Yee-tin Sword? Right. We will settle our own matters. We don't want the interference from the government. Thank you very much. Master Chang, please stay, I've prepared some food for you. I will get changed, may I be excused. We are leaving. Do you know there is "Black Jade Paster" or not? Damn it, how cocky are you? Is it true or not? It smells nice. This may be a trap, we'd better go. - Go. - Yes. You... Master, we are so tired, we lost our energy. My brothers are all poisoned by this. I am the only one who held the breathe. What can we do now? I will get the antidote from her. Siu Chiu, take care of here. You do keep your promise. You come to drink with me. Why do you trap us? Master Chang, no one asked you to touch the wooden sword. It's because one of you is greedy. That's why they are poisoned. Bring me the antidote. Master Chang, are you begging me or forcing me? Where are the "Jinxs"? Ask them out. Are you scared about them? I won't tell where they are so you will be scared. Don't think that I won't beat you because you are woman. I know, so, I decided to... attack first. Master Chang, why don't you play a song with me? Stop playing. I am loving it! Master Chang, do you want to see my leg? Just tell me. Why do you take my shoes? You are so cunning, how can you claim yourself heroic? I am hot hero at all! I am cunning woman. Have you heard that? Woman is cunning. I won't argue with you. If you don't give me antidote, I will burn your Green Willow Villa. I won't give in a damn but your fellows are seriously poisoned. If they can't get the antidote with 4 hours, they can never re-gain their kung-fu. Time is running short. Jinx's Palm. This is not "Jinx's Palm". No, I don't know it. Ijust wan t to scarify you. If I didn't take back half energy, you would have been killed. You don't wish to kill me. You like me. Bull shit. You love your maid more? Or love me more? If you don't take the antidote out, I will kill you. Go ahead. Answer me, or I won't give you antidote. You... I know you love the maid more. I have made No-mercy going there. How cunning are you! Go, if you go like this, your fellows' kung-fu can never be re-gained. It seems that I have no choice. Give me or not? No. Give me or not? No matter how, no! Aren't you scared of me? I will be your woman sooner or later. I don't need to resist. Anyway, no one will help me. You can do whatever you want. Shameless. Chang Mo-kei, I can give you antidote and the "Black Jade Paster". But, you've to promise me three things. Master, where are those people of Ming Sect? They seem to be disappeared. Master, look! No-mercy again. Siu Chiu, leave us. No, Master asked me to stay here. No matter how, I have to delay. You bastards, what evil deeds are you planning? Master, they seem to be poisoned. Damn you! If you dare to come over, I will suck all your blood! What are you looking at? I have too much blood, it's alright to split some out. I have let you go once. Now, I have a chance to kill the evils for the world of martial arts. Master, it's not heroic to take such advantage. Bitch, get lost! Bitch, if you can resist 3 stances from me, I will let you kill. How dare you. Or, I will take three stances from you. If you defeat me, then I'll let you do whatever you want. What a sharp tongue. If you can resist three of my stances, I will let you go. Come on. Siu Chiu... - How are you? - Are you alright? I can stand it. Two more. Master, she is seriously injured, why not let me to kill her? I should not take my words back. I dare not. Siu Chiu,just leave us. One more. You are looking for death, I can't help you. - Master. - Master. - Siu Chiu. - Mister. Go. - King of Bat, take the antidote to them. - Yes. Mo-kei, why did Chao Min give you antidote? Be careful of tricks. I wanted her to eat three in front of me. It should be real. Siu Chiu. Mister. What a couple. Bitch, how dare you come? Why not? Your master promised me to do three things for me. That's why I gave him the antidote to save your lives. Mister. I just promised to do three things which are not against conscience. Not against heroism. I won't let you marry such pretty girl, Siu Chiu. Isn't it against conscience? Master Chang, not that easy. When I have something in mind, I will look for you. I have never met such cunning woman! This woman must be great foe of our Ming Sect. There must be some story behind the raid against Wu-tong by Shaolin. We have to go to Shaolin Temple now. To get the truth. - Master. - Master, are you alright? Mastress No-mercy, King Yu-yang wants you to be his guest. After you. Shaolin Temple Why is so quiet? Master Chang Mo-kei, together with King of White Eagle and King of Green Bat wants to meet your master. Our master has his order, he doesn't want to see anyone. We come a long way to here. We want to see him now, it's urgent. Please tell your master. He doesn't want to see you. Go back. Wait. From your movement, It doesn't seem to be the kung-fu of Shaolin. You just have your head shaved, and scratched. You are not a real monk. I said he is fake. Master, let's get in and check it out. Okay. Mister, look! Kill Shaolin first, then Wu-tong We, Ming Sect is the supreme of the world of martial arts It's a trap. Are all the kung-fu masters of Shaolin killed? They maybe poisoned by "Scent". I think most of them may be nabbed. - Shit. - What's the matter? Kill Shaolin, then Wu-tong. They must have gone to Wu-tong. - Let's hurry there. - Yes. Do you want to leave? Not that easy. Master, you'd better leave first. Master, what's the matter? Hung-shang from Shaolin wants to meet Master Chang. Follow me. Master, Shaolin has had the greatest disaster. We were raided by the Evil Sect, other than me. No one is alive. Really? The kung-fu masters who launched a raid to the Bright Summit were all arrested by the Evil Sect. Master Chang, if you don't do something, the whole world of martial arts will be under the control of Evil Sect. Get up first. Watch out, Master. This monk is fake, he is from the Evil Sect. Where is your dad and uncles? Master. Mo-kei didn't die, he joined the Evil Sect and learnt lots of Evil Magic. My dad and four uncles were not prepared. Five of them... Ching-su, what's happened? Master. Ching-su, how dare you assassinate me? Even a scapegoat couldn't cheat you. Master, you should be the man of the world. You are great in kung-fu, it's not wise to be a taste here. Why not follow me to work for the government to enjoy prosperous life together. You... Chang San-fung, do you remember us? I see, the troubles in all these years were designed by the government. Right, you are right. Our Majesty wants to make you the Pope of our government. If you are willing to work for us, your school will enjoy prosperity together. Your students will be the generals. To settle the riots for my government. I Chang San-fung, do whatever I think its right, but I'll never be a tribal betrayer. Chang, you don't work for us, what you have to do is only to go to hell. Don't panic, I just want to scratch my back. Chang, how much blood do you have? Protect Master. Don't, let me handle this. Magic Stance. Master. Master, are you alright? - Mo-kei. - How are you? Ching-su, that bastard assassinated me. Why are you so powerful? You asked me to keep my virtue. I haven't used that. Cut the crap. Your Highness. How can you be that impolite to Master Chang? How are you, Master Chang? I am Chao Min. Your Highness. Master Chang, don't be tough. Do you want your students to be killed? Men must die once. But we should die meaningfully. Master, don't panic, I am here. Master Chang, do you remember... you've promised to do three things for me? Will you keep your promise? If only they are not against conscience and not heroic. I'll help. First, you can't use the "Great Solar Stance". Just tie himself up, alright? What a sharp tongue, I'll seal your mouth sooner or later. Second, don't use your "Magic Stance". Alright, I promise. - What kind of kung-fu will you use? - Master, teach me any. Why not the kung-fu of Wu-tong? - Isn't it alright? - It's alright. Master, come on. Tai-chi, grows from nothing. Master, you start that so late. I couldn't stand. Quick. Mo-kei, now I teach you my self-developed tactics since 100-year-old Tai-chi Fist It's the origin of motion. The origin of everything. Positive and negative is connected. Can't be separated. Two elements help each other. They are against each other. Keep calm. Mind your respiration. Concentrate your mind. Pay full attention. Turn soft to hard. Use both soft and hard. In Tai-chi, there is soft and hard. Use both soft and hard. Generate the force as you wish. Mo-kei, you're protected by the "Great Solar Stance", you can learn all kinds of kung-fu quickly. Tai-chi, just remember it's meaning, not the stance. Forget all your stance. Thus you can make it. Can you remember? I've forgotten. - What is the name of these stances? - Forgot. - What's the surname of your dad? - Forgot. Okay, just remember one thing - To beat them with no mercy. Congratulations, you have such a good student. You have a good grandson too. I will let you go now. Chang Mo-kei, I won't let you repay me that easily. The lives of the six schools are controlled by me. If I don't go back within three days, they will all be killed. What do you want? Today, you are lucky. Let's go. Not that easy. Don't go. Okay, I won't go. I will stay here for more days. You'd better prepare the funerals for your friends. You may go but not Ching-su. Your Highness, don't leave me. Such heartless dog, it's useless for me to keep. Take it if you like. Master, I deserved to be killed, I am useless. Master,just let me go. How can you face your dad? Mo-kei... Since we grow up together, please beg Master to let me go, please. Mo-kei. Uncle Sung has one son only. If I kill you, he will have no descendant. Alright. Master, I have terminated all his kung-fu. Please let him stay alive. Alright. Master, thank you. Thank you. Chang Mo-kei, you still have to do one more thing for me. If you want to save the six schools, come to capital to look for me.
