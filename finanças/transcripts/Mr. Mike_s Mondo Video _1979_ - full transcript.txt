WOMAN: Excuse me, sir? What is Mondo? , it's a difficult question. ANNOUNCER: What is Mondo? It's a tough question, you know. MAN: It's a strange question. ANNOUNCER: What is Mondo? Donkey pie... I'm proud to say I'm an actual genetic mutant. [WOMAN SCREAMS] [WOMAN LAUGHS] [GLASS SHATTERING] [GROWLING] [GUNSHOT] Okay, I guess we are just not ready to show that film? Let's show it. Good evening. I'm Mr. Mike, inviting you to come with me into a world where the bizarre is commonplace, and the commonplace bizarre. It is an odyssey of aggressive weirdness. Whatever raw, savage acts, man's hellish brain can conceive, our cameras are there, scouring the globe, seeking out the cheap thrills, the pointless perversities, the shabby secrets, the grotesque, the pathetic... [THUDS] Unholy... [THUD] , the unholy, the twisted, the macabre, the outre, the eerie, [DISTANT SIRENS] the mystifying, the sky above, the mud below, blue water, white death in search of Michael Rockefeller.

Or as the Dutch call it, city of cats and canals. A dangerous combination, and yet, miraculously, there hasn't been a can't drowning in over 300 years. Incredible, you say? Let's stop in Europe's oldest can't swimming school and talk to instructor, hans Hoop. One, two and breathe. One, two and breathe. Keep the toes and the tail pointed, claws in, and don't be afraid to get those whiskers wet. You do it when you drink milk. Okay, here we go. [SPLASH] Yumpin' yimminy! You're swimming! Now, remember that flutter kick! HANS: Moments like these, make it all worthwhile. When I can take a student, who is scared of the water, [SPLASH] help him conquer his fear, and give him a sense of pride and self-confidence, well, you can see it, it carries over to other areas of their life. Boots here, couldn't swim a stroke when she first came. But look at her now. [SPLASH] HANS: Come on! Move those paws! Okay, that's great. Take a shower. [CLAPPING] Why, yingo! Two thirty! Time for my advanced and intermediate class. [WHISTLES] Everybody in the pool! [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Lovely! Just lovely! But it's only a small part of Holland's complete feline safety program. For this is not just a swimming school, it is also the Royal Dutch Hang Gliding School for Cats, located high atop Amsterdam's tallest building. Usually land on their feet. Oh, well, good thing he's got eight more lives to go. [GROWLING] Coming up next! Big, stupid dinosaurs that don't look very real, jojo, the human hotplate, looking up Cheryl Tieg's dress, and much more, after this word from our sponsor. [TIRES SCREECHING] A word of advice. What you've just seen is tame compared to what follows. Footage, so brutal and candid, that many found it offensive. Most, have called it offensive. So get the kids, the crazies, the old people. Get them around the set and turn up the volume, because you're about to enter the astounding world of Mr. Mike's Mondo Video. You are all suspects in the eyes of the Jack Lord. Guilty until proven innocent. You have the right to remain silent. AUDIENCE: [SHOUTS] Yes! You have the right to contact a lawyer. But you have no right to smuggle heroin onto the island.

I get it, I get it. AUDIENCE: Choose me! I can't bust you people, only the Jack Lord can bust you. [EXCLAIMS] I've never bothered much about religion. And then, one night, jack Lord suddenly appeared to me on my Magnavox. I could see him clear as day. And from that point on, I was a believer. Well, hail me, your TV guide! AUDIENCE: Hail! Hear me in your home once a week! AUDIENCE: Yes! You'll fill your life with joy! Yes! And suspense! Yes! And adventure! Oh, yes! He showed me more than the secret of life.

In that violent case, top secret film of a terrifying new weapon. Film, which he has agreed to sell, for 20,000 dollars. The transaction goes smoothly, and within minutes, the film is on the Mondo plane winging its way to our headquarters in Rome. Why do we risk the jail terms, the beatings, the homosexual rape, for 20,000 dollars? Because as top Italian journalists, we feel a moral obligation to expose this awesome threat posed by the American War Machine. Laser Bra 2000. [INDISTINCT BACKGROUND VOICE] So this will be a top secret. You're about ready to show this thing now? Oh, okay, let's do it. I see you brought it out of the Mondo bank. Yes, I thought that the trip would do it good. This is a big track for Mondo video. MIKE: It's a baby. It's a puppy and a baby. I think you have been cheated, Mr. Mike. Perhaps you could have spent that 20,000 more wisely. Do you think we could get the money back? Son of a bitch! NARRATOR: But exposing the awesome threat of the American War Machine would have to wait. Our cameras are on the move. From the fear-riddled ruins of Macchu Picchu, to the radioactive headquarters of the Nile, from the slime-drenched rainforests of Sumatra, to Paris, France, or City of Frogs, as I like to call it. The Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, the Left Bank, the Champs-Elysees, and of course, the magnificent French cuisine. But here, we found the unique restaurant, a restaurant where American tourists go to be treated like dirt. Unbelievable, you say? Well, step inside, and see for yourself. Bon-jour, you stupid American pigs. Welcome to the Cafe No Americain! Here are your menus. Uh, these aren't menus, these are phonebooks. Well, does it matter to you, ignorant scum, you can't read French any way. I will tell you what's on the menu. For hors-d'oeuvre, we have glazed rabbit pellets. And then for entree, we offer poached dog lips, ground monkey throat, swan with mold, braised hog nostrils, minced dolphin long loaf, and chicken in a mask. Might I suggest the specialty of the evening, the candied mink brains. , pardon. How is that prepared? In the usual way, madame. And then our chef actually takes a whizz on it. It's all in the sauce. [LIPS SMACKING] Well, I'll have that and the pellets. I'll have the same, and bring Cubby here, a half order of the ground monkey throat. No, I want dessert first. , for dessert, we have donkey pie, brandied kittens, or moths in wine. I'll have the moths. Very well, I will take your order to the chef. But first, allow me to flambe your table. It's a French custom. [SCREAMING] Fire! [SCREAMING] Fire! Do something! I'm sorry, it's not my table. [SCREAMING] NARRATOR: Well, here in Australia, these lingerie models cook up a different kind of dinner. [FIRE CRACKLING] We, the makers of Mondo video, are sorry and ashamed to have to insist on showing the following footage. A boy decapitated by a blood-crazed goose, Nazi oven mitts, gig Young's groceries, girls in net stockings kissing each other, and this startling confession. Hello. When the Mondo crew asked me to appear on their Celebrity Deformity section on the show, I really couldn't refuse, honestly. In fact, I lapped up the chance. Guess you could say I'm a celebrity. I've been in the public eye for a couple of years now, and I'm also deformed. In fact, i'm proud to say I'm an actual genetic mutant. Genetically mutated from birth, and that mutation manifests itself in my feet. Now, as you will see here very shortly, the two sets of middle toes on both my feet, are webbed by an actual web of skin, not unlike a reptile. And, just to show you that this isn't some cheap makeup trick, i'm going to take a Phillips head screwdriver, and I'm going to pass it on either side, of the webbed mass between the toes of both my feet. And then actually take the screwdriver and prod the web of skin here, so that you see that in fact, it is organic and real, and much a part of me. And I'd like you to keep that in mind next time you see me. NARRATOR: Stay with us for Marcel Cousteau, the swimming mime, when Mondo video continues. That concludes the milder portion of our film. Now we move on to the truly tasteless. The vile, the degrading, the repulsive, the monstrous, the maniacal. Quite frankly, many of the people on the Mondo crew refused to work on the following footage. Judge for yourself, as we enter the fantastic world of Mr Mike's Mondo video. NARRATOR: Be ready, the Mondo truck is coming to your nation soon. Spanning the earth, our top Italian journalists, ask you the important questions of our time. ANNOUNCER: Do you believe in capital punishment for elephants? I certainly do. I believe in it whole-heartedly. For elephants? Oh, definitely. I don't think they deserve to live because they'll want to make more troubles. Capital punishment for them? Yes. No. They should be in institutions. They should get 15 to 25 years, to life. If they commit a violent crime, I think they should be punished. If they kill somebody, you know. Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not a lawyer. I don't want to say, maybe I'll say the wrong thing. So I don't know. If they kill people, let them be killed too. Then they put them in jail, they get out and do it again. I feel that they should go to jail. Because they go out there and kill them people, innocent people for no reason. So, I feel if they do that, they need to go to jail. What, are you gonna kill a dog or a... They don't understand what they are doing. If he didn't know the crimes he was committing, I see no reason to kill him. The evidence must be there, there must be witnesses, because otherwise I don't believe in it. If they kill somebody, if they rob, they steal, they should be punished just like anybody else. NARRATOR: But there is no rest for the Mondo as our cameras record this never-before-seen film of the Loch Ness monster seized in drug busts. Indisputable photographic proof that these creatures do exist. Six months, and $40,000 later, at last we are ready to expose the awesome threat posed by the American War Machine. [CLICK] Laser Bra 2000. MAN: Incorrect! WOMAN: Imbecile! Well, half-way around the world, in the tiny island kingdom of Bhutan, [LOCAL MUSIC] and then, we took our cameras to Tokyo to see to see what method of birth control Japanese men prefer. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Fly-paper. Ihua-naka. Fly-paper for me. NARRATOR: Well, here in America, people don't eat gelatin dessert. they jump in it. It's the latest fad, and that means everybody's doing it. Doing what? Having their toes webbed. Looking up Cheryl Tieg's dress. And those American gals, well, they're dropping their dream boats for creeps. That's right, the losers are winning out. And if you don't believe us, perhaps you'll believe these glamorous Hollywood starlets. When my date blows his nose in his handkerchief, and then looks at it, I can't say no. Blackheads drive me wild. Dandruff sends me, and dirty fingernails? [GROWLING] I adore men who smell their fingers. Pimples on the back sends my pulse racing. When I know that a guy is over 40, and still lives with his mother, I just can't help myself. It doesn't take much. Acne guns my motor. When my boyfriend is so fat, I can't see his belt, my heart skips a beat. I think it's so cute when guys miss the toilet. I'm a pushover for loose dentures. Hello? Hello! I go the limit for a guy with bad breath. And if he has plaque on his teeth? Wigga-wigga! Guys who sneeze in their hands and wipe it on their pants, get me hot! I think fellas who drink too much and can't get it up are dreamy. If you want to get to first base with me, honey, spit when you talk. When I reach down and feel a firm colostomy bag, I know I'm with a real man. I wouldn't kick Ralph Nader out of bed. And speaking of the war between the sexes, Gig Young's groceries. Very Mondo, very bizarre. But not so bizarre is this training camp for Kate Smith's pall bearers. These Mexican sex aids and the mouse princess hit by two trains. [TRAIN BLARING] [CRASH] More of this when Mondo video continues. Someone once said, I think it was Lou Gehrig it takes a big dog to weigh a ton. Coming up next, this report on radioactive lingerie the women who sell it, the women who wear it, and the tragic results. But first, please welcome Mr. Sid Vicious. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] NARRATOR: We're gonna miss you, Sid. Sid Vicious, a very Mondo kinda guy. [AIRPLANE FLYING] Two years, and a quarter of a million dollars later, we are finally ready to expose the awesome threat posed by the American War Machine. Laser Bra 2000. It's been a long time since we arrived at Rome together? Still no word out of Michael Rockefeller? Hi kids, how are you? Things been pretty good with you people? Okay, I guess we're just about ready to show that film, huh? Let's show it. This better be good. [CLEARS THROAT] Remove the violin case. [CLAPPING] [MARCHING BAND MUSIC] Until now, war has traditionally been a man's profession. But with the introduction of women into the US combat forces, new weapons are required to make optimum use of the female soldiers' unique physical attributes. Laser Bra 2000 is the most devastating of these weapons. [SHOOTING] We saw it turning the female foot soldier into a curvaceous killing machine. These deadly foundation garments support, lift, and separate. Shown here are recent tests conducted in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, female sharpshooters demonstrate the uncanny accuracy and firepower built into these experimental brassieres. [SHOOTING] [CLINK] [SHOOTING] [CLINK] [SHOOTING] [CLINK] [SHOOTING] [CLINK] Here is one weapon we hope will never fall into enemy hands. [SHOOTING AND CLINKING] But if you think these lasers are something, the other day, I saw a cowgirl packing up her pair of 38's. [SHOOTING AND CLINKING] Hey lady, if you're gonna sell those puppies, I want the one with the pink nose. You are a donkey, right, Mr. Mike? Many of these men have eaten human flesh. But more about them later. NARRATOR: Aberdeen, Scotland. Breeding ground for deviants. One is reminded of an old Scottish proverb, the only difference between a woman and a sheep is you can't make a sweater out of a woman. Incredible photographs, but not so incredible as this woman, who dares protect the future of Jeane Dixon. WOMAN: I predict that Jeane Dixon will be the only old lady that nobody likes. [CAR HONKING] Well, here in downtown New York, stands the world's largest mound of garbage. Enough garbage to feed and clothe every Albanian, with a little left over to sleep at. [THUD, CLINK] [MUSIC INSTRUMENT PLAYING] [CHIRPING] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [HUMMING] [FOOTSTEPS] [WOMEN LAUGHING] Coming up next, Japanese bathing in dolphin blood, fried money, and Christmas on other planets, when Mondo video continues. [SHATTERING] [GROWLING] Limousines for some of Mr. Mike's guests, furnished by East Wind Limousine Service, in exchange for this promotional announcement. [WIND BLOWING] As a producer of this movie, I must apologize for the quality of the following footage. The subject matter was so loathesome, so ghastly and appalling that no legitimate film lab would touch it. But in no way did these minor technicalities blunt the stark naked impact, as we enter the exotic world of Mr. Mike's Mondo Video. [CINEMA MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Yeah, the Mondo truck is back, bringing you tomorrow's headlines today, discussing the issues that our brain discusses. WOMAN: Should people who are deaf and dumb be allowed to talk with their hands while driving a car? No. Why? Absolutely not, because it is very unsafe. Why? Why, I mean... Well, if they can't talk and they have to really say something, they can't say it. I mean, so what's the point in it? Well, if you take your hands off the steering wheel, I think that would be hazardous. I would not let them drive. It's a type of question that I really can't say yes or no, I think if a person could drive, and, they will be able to talk, if they could drive with one hand, and talk to another person in the car, then I think that's something that would be allowable. But if it is going to interfere with their driving... They are gonna go, just go right off to highway, you know what, in your rest area, just clear out the whole rest area. They hit a gasoline truck, boom! Everything goes, you know. And hundreds of people are killed, like over in Spain. They can't talk for both, and drive, that's not permitted. No, I would say, no. I think it's dangerous. Oh, never. Never. [LAUGHING] Now... It's a tough question, you know, but somebody's got to draw the line somewhere. You know, I hate to be the one, but you know, no, they can't do it. [SNIFFS] [SPITS] NARRATOR: Let's move on to Libya, where people have another opinion. [SHOUTS] [FIRING] WOMAN: Sound rolling. MAN: Okay, quiet please. Can I have background action? Camera. Camera rolling. Chopper get ready. Armageddon, crowd scene, take one. [CLAP] Okay, first to go to both sides, come through, please. Chopper? [STATIC] Okay, go now. [STATIC] Okay. Good. Just take it slow and hover. Dock after train pigeon wound up. Right. [CHOPPER WHIRRING] Last couple, look out of the postcard stand. And stop, good... And continue. Doc, release the pigeon. People moving, give me some energy now. Ready with the smoke machines? You know what? I'm set to go. That's a professional. Drive wide at me at the camera. Can I have a group of ten from the left? Brown car in. Background people, more energy now, come on. Brown car, come through. People, don't bunch it up like that. Brown car, move it! Come on, hustle through, brown car, move it! White car in. Okay, on the right, who do we have? Ben and Teddy, come through, please. That's it, do your stuff. You two in a scuffle? What? You ready with the debris? Yeah. Give me three explosions. I think we have a problem here. No, don't think, just fix it. We're going in thirty seconds. Where's everybody? Skip and Jane, please come through. Green car through. Chopper, bring her in. [STATIC] All right. Green car through, green car through. [CHOPPER WHIRRING] Who the hell hired this guy? Chad, I want you to walk through, and casually head towards the postcard stand. Driver, you're fired. Okay, Ted, turn right, good, and go talk to the pretzel man. Beautiful work, Ted. Guys! Okay, Manuel, you're on. Now lots of energy. Come through. Beautiful, beautiful! Oscar time! Okay, people, here we go with the big one in 10 seconds. Don't anticipate the blast, please! All effects units, standby. Unit 1, smoke! All ready! Okay, unit 3, explosion? All ready! I'll back up you then, standby. Three, two, one, go! Ted, what's wrong? I think a wire just... Look, it's your job to make it work. Doc, give me another bird, please. Give me seven more people. Keep the action going! Everything's working now! All right, this is it. Everybody stand by. Five, four, three, two... Hold it, hold it, hold it. No, it's wrong, the feeling's all wrong. Starting positions, please. Am I asking too much of you people? Cut! Let's do it again, please! [BEEPS] NARRATOR: Often tonight, you've heard me use the word, Mondo. Perhaps you wonder what it means. I think Sylvia Schichman explains it best. SYLVIA: I have a poem here, that wasn't written by me. that I was directed to work over by ESP recently. We'll call it, when I took a poetry course, many years ago. I was recently directed where to find it, what the name was, everything. I didn't know where it was. So, uh, this was in a new school, and it was written by Jan Beeman. Charlie and the Rain, only I would change it, to the golden rose called Rita. He refused to acknowledge any names. She refused to acknowledge any names. He took off his name. She took off her name. He took off his age. She took off her age. He took off his clothes. She took off her clothes. She put on his clothes. He put on her clothes. She put on his age. He put on her age. She put on his name. He put on her name. She agreed to acknowledge all names. He agreed to acknowledge all names. NARRATOR: Sylvia Schichman on the meaning of Mondo. Coming up next, Nose-binding among Chinese Jews, new hope for the criminally insane, and the song of the harpooned humpback whale. [FIRING] when Mondo video continues.

MAN: This is a man in a dog suit. He's a member of a radical underground organization. Notice his uniform, the artificial sialoid tongue, the flappy cotton ears. Notice that he has no hair on his forearms, or hind legs. His snout is obviously false. You can see clearly the contours of his face. Protect your children. The radical underground is once again preying upon the generous nature of the public. Do not be taken in by this charade.

WOMAN: Should smoking be permitted in mental institutions? No, it's dangerous. I think it is dangerous to have smoking in mental institutions, because, the poor, sweet, wonderful souls, they may forget and do something to themselves with the cigarette. Thank you, have a merry Christmas, everybody! NARRATOR: Coming up next, deli of the damned, [CRACKLING] stern measures for stuffed animals, [CRACKLING] [EXOTIC MUSIC PLAYING] and the obscene gestures of other lands, when Mondo video continues.

The natives are worried, they do not understand. [NATIVE LANGUAGE] The long vigil is over. The iron birds have come. [YELLING] These simple islanders are the victims of a wasteful society. Once a month, the planes fly over dropping, not food and medical supplies, but America's discarded things, the flotsam and jetsam of a decadent culture. [CHATTERING] [SHOUTING] [CHEERING] Once a proud and industrious people, now they have forgotten their traditional ways. [LAUGHING] Their fishing boats lie rotting in the sand. The nets, torn and unmended. They have turned their harpoons into tetherball poles. [EXOTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Here, where once hung, ancient tribal masks celebrating the glory of their ancestors, now hangs psychedelic posters, and pop art. The circumcision altar is defiled by Crazy Foam. These debased and pathetic creatures have forgotten the ways of nature. Even their sacred fire is a fraud. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CHANTING] No longer do they make sacrifice to the old Gods. Now they are content to sit on the beach and worship lava lamps. [CHANTING] Here is a people that are sad, pitiful, a disgrace to humanity. These fierce warriors are now spineless slaves to gadgets and gizmos. Where is their manhood, one is forced to ask! How can they live in such shame and humiliation? [YELLING] It is not sympathy one feels, but almost a physical disgust, a repulsion... [YELLING] [GROANING] MAN: Oh, my God! They got Mr. Mike! Does it hurt? Only when I laugh. Leave him! Leave him! [MOANING IN PAIN] [MAN YELLING] [GROANING] [NATIVES SHOUTING] [WAVES SPLASHING] [ITALIAN THEME SONG PLAYING]
