The ocean is a mysterious world. One that land dwellers can only begin to imagine. Of course, you think you know what lies beneath the surface. Ah, but the sea creatures who live there, well, even the ones you have imagined, you've imagined them wrong. Take the mythical, mighty giant kraken. Bloodthirsty monster, sinker of ships, drowner of sailors. That's what you people think. You see, in real life, krakens are noble protectors. The sea will always need a kraken, and a kraken will always answer the call. ♪ We can take turns... ♪ Ruby-doo. Hey, Margot. I am dying of suspense. What did your mom say? Well, I chickened out last night, but I'm going to ask her now, right now, this second. Did you do the confidence-building exercise I taught you? I did something even better. ♪ We'll never cave or we'll never waver ♪ ♪ And we'll always become braver and braver ♪ ♪ We'll dance like nobody's there ♪ ♪ We'll dance without any cares ♪ ♪ We'll talk 'bout problems we share ♪ ♪ We'll talk 'bout things that ain't fair ♪ ♪ We'll sing 'bout things we don't know ♪ ♪ We'll sing to people and show ♪ ♪ What it means to be young ♪ ♪ And growing up. ♪ Oh, hey. Junior prom is the sacred rite of every human teenager. As a kraken who is barely pulling off this whole human thing, I need to be there so that I can blend in. And, as a proud mathlete, I know that to find a potential solution, I have to evaluate the problem. Now, I know the rules. Our family is not allowed in the ocean, ever. For any reason. And I love rules. I do. I really, really do. But the prom boat is on the water, not in the water. "What if there's a storm?" you might ask. Well, I've analyzed weather trend data, and my trusty friend, the Internet, has assured me that it will be smooth sailing on prom night. And lastly, this is the captain of said prom boat. Look into those eyes. Tell me he hasn't seen it all. I trust him with my life, and so should you. And that is why I, Ruby Gillman, should go to prom. Thank you. Please, please, please, please, please! Strong presentation. I like the energy, but it's still a no, honey. But, Mom, evidence, science, Internet. Trust me, Ruby, I know what's best for you. And what's best is to always stay on land. That's why we moved here. It's much safer for us. Sorry, Tadpole, Mom's right. Sam, breakfast! Hey, didn't you say that prom was a postbolognal... Postcolonial patriarchal construct. It is. But we would go as a group. As a form of protest. Wow. So brave. What do you think? I had these printed for my big launch party. I think I'm in love. -Blech. -Do you still need me to be there? Yes. This is a make-or-break moment. I'm selling an entire development. But, Mom, you're... Agatha Gillman, and I slay the competition. She got us our dream home, and I'm not asking how. Well, I just want to show potential buyers what a happy Oceanside family looks like. I'll be closing my shop for the day so I can man the grill. From chill man to grill man. Ooh, Arthur, you should think about hiring someone to help you. Business has been booming since you started Bottled Up. Hey there. Welcome back to Bottled Up. Now, let's hoist those sails. Magic. Wow, you two are quite the power couple. You think that's great? You're looking at the undefeated dodgeball champ. He's a legend. Ooh. Yeah, yeah. You guys are all crushing it. Oh, Ruby, don't sell yourself short. You're amazing at math. I am the reason Connor's passing algebra. Oh, Connor. - So dreamy. - Sam. Ow. You're the one in love with him. Hey, hey. Stop. You each landed one. Marine Biologist Quarterly? Oh, Ruby. You're still reading this trash? Humans don't know everything about the ocean. Mom, there's a whole world down there that I have never seen. Jellyfish, plankton, coral reefs... But what else lives there? I know. Monsters. And those monsters want to hurt krakens like us. This is where we belong. Oceanside is our home. Then help me fit in by letting me go to prom. Ruby, the answer is no. Time to go. - Mom. - Gillman dishes to Gillman. The fadeaway at the buzzer, - and it's good! - Yeah. Woo-hoo! Limb up, everyone. Let's all have a very human day. Does it bother you guys that we lie to everyone all the time? Oh, we're not lying. We're just omitting. Yeah, okay. And remember... If anyone asks, we're from Canada. Whoa, what's happening? - Are we supposed to be stopped? - Is our tour over? Apologies for the unplanned interruption, folks. Well, look what the tide dragged in, Davey. Ahoy, Mr... Captain Gordon Lighthouse, sir. Aren't you one of them Gillmans? Guilty. Just kidding. Not guilty. Totally normal. - Is she blue? - I'm from Canada... eh. Oh... That totally makes sense. I've got my eye on you, Gillman girl. And my other eye, too! Our tour begins where 15 years ago, I swear I saw the monstrous giant kraken. And to your right, Oceanside's best saltwater taffy. Ask for the Gordon Lighthouse discount. Hey, guys. - Yo. -Greetings. - So, how did it go? Yes. I'm dying to find out. Same. I've been stress-gaming. Well, it's official. Mom won't let me go to prom. And I know it's not what we wanted, but we still have plan B, our very cool anti-prom party. And what is the most liberated food out there? Guys, I'm talking fondue. Ruby, um, I'm just gonna come right out and say it. Kayla asked me to the prom. - Oh. - And, uh, I said carpe diem. Aka, I said yes. - What? - I said yes. No, I got that. Loud and clear. Okay, Margot has torn our hearts into a million tiny pieces, and that's fine. More fondue for the rest of us, right, guys? Yeah, uh, once Margot was going with Kayla, Trevin said, "Oh, well, should we just go together?" And I agreed. So Trevin and I are going to the prom together. As friends. Yeah, only as friends. What? What? Sorry, Ruby. We promised to always stick together. Does squad solidarity mean nothing to you? Well, of course it does. Which is why you should come with us. You'll be on a boat. You'll be completely safe. Unless there's a tragic accident. - Bliss, no catastrophizing. - Sorry. You guys know my mom, and that is why we made plan B. Margot, just bring Kayla to our anti-prom party. We will watch bad movies. We'll dip Swiss. Enough with the fondue! We eat a lot of cheese. Wheels of it. Think about how many events we've missed in squad solidarity because of your mom's irrational anti-ocean rule. I guess a few. What? There was the field trip to the submarine museum. The school beach day. - All-county surf contest. - The Grunion Fun Run. The Oceanside Festival of the Bard. My grandmother's beach birthday party. Kayla's beach birthday party! Any birthday party but Bliss's. You're always welcome at the graveyard. But this isn't just any party. This is prom. And I really want to be a part of it. We all do. Yeah. No, I get it. You guys should go without me. It's one thing for my mom to ruin my life. She doesn't have to ruin yours. Uh, what if you don't tell her? Gasp of exclamation! Trevin's right. Your mom doesn't have to know. Deception. I'm on board. Come on, Ruby. Do it. Do it. I want to, but if my mom finds out, uh... Oh, life is not a dress rehearsal. It's time for you to go big and go to prom. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. You're right. Okay, I'll do it. - I'll go to prom. - Yes! And I'm gonna ask Connor. Connor? Okay, that's a... that's a big swing there. Whoo. But we are here for it. Step one, you're going to need a prom-posal. Blue-sky with me, people. Any ideas? Maybe I can ask him with something epic, like an advanced quadratic equation. And when I solve it, the answer is... prom. Ruby, my sweet, wide-eyed, dumbest smart person ever, you cannot ask Connor to prom with homework. But look how it graphs. It's cool. It is not cool. A good prom-posal is art. Showmanship is the name of the game in this hormone-fueled benchmark of adolescence. A ritual that embodies the ultimate in high risk, high reward. and one shot at persuading your Romeo that you are his Juliet. With stakes this high, the only option is to go big. Everyone, don't forget to RSVP for prom, the most important day of your lives. I almost asked Connor to prom with homework. We got you, Ruby. There are so many other options. Here, this is the first draft, but with this script and my favorite prop from clown school... Mm, I don't know. Do you have something a little smaller? Tone down the drama, you say? - I know just the thing. - What's that? A commercial-grade DJ confetti cannon. You just ask Connor to prom, push this button, and the confetti will rain down like closing night on Broadway. Uh, maybe I abandon this whole "ask your dream guy to prom" thing. ♪ I really, really wanna get to know ya ♪ Connor. ♪ Hello, hello ♪ ♪ I really, really wanna get to know ya ♪ ♪ Hello, hello... ♪ Connor, would you do me the honor of going to human prom with me? Oh, Ruby, yes. Oh, you've made me the happiest guy on dry land, Ruby. - Connor. - Ruby. Ruby? Hi. Connor's here. Uh, yeah. Connor's here. Oh! Oh. Hi. Hi, hi, hi. Uh... we're still on for our tutoring sesh later, right? Oh. Oh, yeah, Connor. We are on like polygons. All right. Team math. I'll see you later. You know it. Anything for my alge-bae. - Your what now? - I mean bro. A-Alge-bro. Like you're my brother. You're my math brother. You know, I think I liked the first one better. Give me that confetti cannon. Yes! You gotta practice. The trick is to reject the concept of gravity. It doesn't exist. It's not real. All right. Peace out. Yo, hit me up later. - Hey, Connor. - Hey, Ruby. What's up? Um, hey. So, I was wondering, did you see, like, all those prom-posals around school this morning? - Yes. - Hmm. They kind of weird me out. Just ask someone. It doesn't have to be this big proposal. It's crazy, right? Oh, yeah, I hear that. And besides, prom is a postcolonial - patriarchal construct. - Patriarchal construct. - Exactly. - Exactly. It could be fun to go with the right person, though. Oh. Yeah. Totally. - Ruby... Oh. - Connor... Oh, sorry. - Ruby... Oh, hey. - Connor... Oh, you go. - No, you go. - No. You go. Yeah, no, you go. I go. Wait. Okay, no. But seriously, what-what did you want to say? Um, Connor, I... I... - think I'm gonna be sick. - Whoa. Hey. Are-are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I get seasick sometimes when I'm next to the ocean. It's genetic. You know, my sisters do this grounding technique thing. Ooh. Whoops. Wait, what's this? -Hah. Oh. That? Never seen that before. -Whoa. - Is this a kaleidoscope? - Maybe put it down. - It's party time! Connor! Connor, are you okay? Connor, grab this! Son of an anglerfish! Connor! Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. What just happened? Connor. - The new girl saved Connor. - Connor? - She's a hero. - Connor. Ruby, there you are. You missed the story of the year, girl. - Connor almost drowned. - I didn't mean to. I mean I-I didn't do it. Gosh, that's crazy. And surprising. Because it definitely didn't have anything to do with me. Are you feeling all right? Why are you wet? Connor. Are you okay? Yeah. It was crazy. I just remember there was smoke and glitter. And then the next thing I knew, I was saved by the new girl. The new girl? The new girl. - Thank you. Thank you. - Whoo! New girl. She's going to say something. - Shh. - - Picture this, me, stunning but approachable, on my first day of school. I'm lost and confused, struggling to find my first class. When suddenly...... I spot little mister skater boy here barely above water. - I'm just lucky that... - Oh. Shush, shush. Ooh. My story. Now, I'm not much of a swimmer, but in that moment, I remembered what my mother always told me: "You are gorgeous." Also, "Big risk, big reward. Always go big." And what is bigger than saving a life? Yes, queen. Get it. I love you so much. Love you, too, rando. She pointed at me. I'm Rando. Oh, no. What's happening? - Watch it. - Ah. Excuse me. Wait. We haven't met. I'm Chelsea, Chelsea Van Der Zee. - It's Dutch. Kusjes! - So exotic. I love you. - And you are? - I'm, um... I'm Ruby Gillman. It's Canadian... eh. Okay, maybe it's the whole "don't look at me" vibe, but there's something different about you. I-I really gotta go now. - Uh, are you good? - What's wrong with her? Yeah, you might need to lie down for a little bit. Yeah, that's awkward. What's her deal? Is she gonna barf? Freaking out. Are you okay? You really look like you've been through something. Yeah. I really got to go. Now. All right, everyone. Show's over. Let's get back to class. Welcome to your new home, if I may be so bold. - Ooh. - This is incredible. Oh, you've picked a great place to raise a kid. It's so safe here in Oceanside. Moving my family here was the best decision I ever made. Doug actually grew up here. We're moving back so that we can be closer to his folks when the little one comes. Hello, free babysitting. How nice. Just be careful they don't tell you how you should live your life and raise your children. I mean, it'll be so nice to have family nearby. You're very lucky. Oh, why am I glowing? Glowing is not good. I will never go into the ocean again. Lesson learned. Call Mom. Video call Connor. What? I didn't say that. Call Mom. Ruby, where'd you go? Whoa. Hey. End call, end call, end call. Wait, I wanted to ask you some... I'm going through a tunnel. Call Mom. No, I can't call Mom. She's gonna kill me. Mm? There's three of them? Oh, this is a nightmare. No! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hello? Pride and Prejudice. You're a long way from home. What are you doing in True Crime? Shh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. A lot of you have been asking about my beard regimen. Do you see that? - Kraken! - What is that? - Kraken ahoy! She's back! - Oh, my goodness. Oh, she's coming for me. - Oh. Look at this view. - Wow. Holy migoli, this is amazing. What do you think, boo? I think... we're sold! Oh. Fantastic. Well, I'll get the paperwork started, and we'll make this quick and easy so you can focus on your little one. - I can't believe this is ours. - Look at this house. - This is beautiful. - Honey, you were saying you wanted a built-in grill, and that is built-in. Oh, man, I get to be grillmaster again. You make sure you enjoy every minute of quiet you have left because once the baby comes, it is going to blow up - your whole life. - Okay. Okay. Look around. Get a feel for the place. Just leave the key in the lockbox when you're done. Or-or keep it. Whatever. Talk soon. Pick up, Ruby. Pick up. Oh, pick up, Ruby. Pick up! Okay. Agatha, you can figure this out. Everything is gonna be fine. Son of an anglerfish! It's probably just a traffic cone. Oh, no. Hello? Heya, sis. Good old Uncle Brill's here to see his favorite niece Ruby. - What? Brill? - Heya. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? I just hit you with a car. How do you guys deal with the gravity here on land? It's crazy, right? Anyway, I came to say congratulations. Ruby's all grown-up and turned into a giant... Shh, shh, shh. Not so loud. - Come on. - Whoa. I see you still got that upper body strength, huh? Ow. Oof. - ♪ Oh, when I say something ♪ - Ow! - ♪ I wish I had shut up ♪ Are you kidding me? - ♪ I always screw things up ♪ - ♪ Oh! ♪ - ♪ The places that feel right ♪ ♪ They never last too long ♪ ♪ And when I think of things ♪ - ♪ They always turn out wrong ♪ ♪ Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong... ♪ What are you doing here, Brill? We felt the pulse. So Mom knows? Uh, yeah. She sent me to get Ruby. This is exactly why she wasn't supposed to go into the ocean. Uh, then why would you live next to it? - We needed to stay moist. - Ew. Moist. Where is she? Where is she? - I need to hide her. - Whoa. Good luck hiding that. ♪ What can I say? ♪ ♪ What can I do? What can I do? ♪ Ow! ♪ Oh! Oh! ♪ ♪ Oh! ♪ Oh, no. - Wow... - Brill, stay. Ruby Gillman, come out here. We need to get you home right now. But... I'm a... a monster. Oh, honey, you're not a monster. Not even close. I don't want to yell. Can we just talk? Please, just... just talk to me. Hey, there's my girl. Please don't be mad. I should have listened to you. But I kind of - went into the ocean. - Went into the ocean? I know. But right now I just want to keep you safe, honey, and that means getting you home. Mom, look at me. I won't even fit inside our house anymore. - Mom. - Hey. Hey, hey. Shh. You'll get small again. It just takes a little time. I'm here. I'll wait with you. I'm not going anywhere. I'm really glad you're here, Mom. Do you remember when you found that whale on the beach? You mean Clarence J. Whifferton? How could I forget? Clarence J. Whifferton. You stood next to him with a hose for seven hours until the tide came back in. Oh, yeah. I asked you if I could keep him. Where would we even have put him? We had a hose. A garage. Come on. I would have taken care of him. I know you would have. Yes. I'm normal. Well, almost normal. Thank you. Trust me, it's gonna be okay. Aw... Ooh, I see you got your mom's arm strength. Mom, what is happening?! Hey, Tadpole. What's up? How would I know? No one tells me anything. Ruby went into the ocean, Arthur. - Oh, no! - And you didn't die? - Die? Why would she die? - Oh, no. - Who's this guy? - Who's this kid? Uh, that's our son, Sam. Son? As in, I'm an uncle? Again? I've never had an uncle before. And I've never had a nephew before. Ruby, take a deep breath. Let me explain. You see, when you went in the ocean, it triggered... Uh, it released... The kraken! What Brill means is you turn into a giant kraken. I know this is a lot to process, Ruby, but you're not alone. I turn into a giant kraken, too. What? What? You knew? So, I'm this? The horrible stereotype of krakens that you said humans made up. - I'm offended. - It sells. - So what else is true about me, Mom? Do I sink ships now? Do I terrorize sailors? No. No, honey. Not at all. All this time, you told me we were hiding from monsters, and it turns out I'm the monster. You lied to me. Think of it more as a tiny omission. Come on. Turn giant. I'm recording. Sam, put it away. But this is the coolest thing ever. It is not cool. I was already a little weird, but this? - I can't hide this. - Yes, you can. You don't get it, Mom. Every single day, I make sure no one notices all the ways that I am different. I push my hair in front of my gills, and I stand like I have a spine. It's hard, but this is impossible. No, because you can control it, Ruby. Just like I have for all these years. Yeah, but you didn't have to go to high school with tentacles. Do I get tentacles, too? Sorry, son. Only the women in our family turn giant. The men just become older, rounder versions of ourselves. It's not great. Ruby, listen. The ocean triggers the transformation. But if you stay on dry land, you'll stay small and on two legs. Cool. Everyone at school is talking about the monster that destroyed the library. As long as no one figures out it was you, we're safe. Your body is going through changes. Think of it as blossoming. Ugh, Dad. Do your tentacles ooze poison? - Sam! - How is this even happening right now? As long as you stay out of the ocean... Your body is a flower. - Do you grow any extra arms? - Blossoming. - Women are so lucky. - Things will go back to normal. Can everyone just stop?! Dad, this isn't a good thing. Sam, I'm going to strangle you with my tentacles. And, Mom, I can't. I just can't right now. Ah, she forgot to do me. I don't even know you! Well, why can't we just talk about it? Because it doesn't matter. Keep it down, Brill. Sis, if I could find you, then it's only a matter of time before the rest of the ocean can, too. I can handle this on my own. Just come home and talk to her. She wants to help Ruby. She never just helps, though, does she? At least tell Ruby the whole truth. Ruby's life is on land now, Brill. I know you mean well, but you need to stop. Go home and let me take care of my daughter. Aggie... I can't believe Mom is still hiding things from me. Nessie, you tiny genius. That guy can't hide anything. Oh, put those on ice. Good idea. I can do both for you. Wha... Lock your doors! The kraken has returned! Brill? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? - Brill? - Get off me, you feathery demons. Ow! You winged dopes. Ow, hey, hey. Save yourself. It's too late for me. Forget the corn dog. Did you see that? They took my stick snack. Uncle Brill, focus. - I need to know. - Mm-hmm? Who sent you here? Mmm. No. No, no, no. No. Please don't ask me things. I'm so bad at keeping secrets. Just talk to your mom. - Mom won't tell me anything. - Well, neither will I. She should be the one to tell you about your grandmother. - My what? - Nothing. I didn't say grandmother. What? Uh, I said landlubber. Ahoy? - I have a grandmother? - No, no, no. Please, uh, don't listen to me. I don't know what I'm saying. -I'm hungry, and I'm traumatized from before. -Wait. -It's the birds... -If only the women in our family turn into giant krakens, then she's a giant kraken, too. Uh, let the record show I kept that part a secret. - Is she here? - What? No. Your grandmother would never leave the ocean. Honestly, I don't know how your mom did it all these years. Land is not built for a giant kraken. - You're right. - Mm-hmm. It's not. I don't know the first thing about being a giant kraken. But it's not fair to keep me in the dark. Nope. Not at all. I can't keep waiting for answers. I need to take control of my own life. You go, girl. - I'm a kraken. - Preach. And if I want answers, then there's only one person - who can help me. - Your mom. My grandmother. Yeah. No. What? I can't let you do that. Your mom will kill me. Uncle Brill... you have been more helpful than you can imagine. You know, this is the first hug we've had in 15 years. Then I'm really sorry. - For what? - This. Oh! A stick snack. Help! Real clever with the stick trick. I admit that, but... Whoa. Yeah. It's kind of amazing. So, there's no way I'm getting you out of the water now, is there? Well, follow me. Wait, Uncle Brill.

A warrior queen, Ultimate Lordess, Ruler of the Seven Seas, et cetera, et cetera. Give me a hug. So tight. - Oh. - Not now, Brill. It's Ruby's time now. You said you'd be okay with it, huh? Of course, Mamah. I'm not that needy, so... I can't believe you're my grandmother. Please, call me Grandmamah. You seem surprised by the level of general majesty and royal splendor. I definitely wasn't expecting the whole queen thing. Your mother never told you you were royalty? I guess it was another tiny omission. Tiny omission?! Agatha! Don't worry. I go to therapy now. I see a wise hammerhead shark on Wednesdays and Fridays, and I've let my rage go. Away, rage. Ah, cookies. Help yourself, Ruby. Mmm. They're really... they're really good. A little mushy. I made someone make them myself. Now, talk to your grandmamah. Tell me everything. Was it horrible living among the hairy crust dwellers? You mean people? Even the word makes my tentacles squirm. People are kinda nice, actually. I have a couple of friends. I asked a boy to prom, but, you know, it... it did not go great. Well, deary, you can put all that behind you. You're made for bigger things. Come with me. I see her. It's Ruby. Whoa. It's Ruby. - It's her. - Look, it's the princess. Is this actually her? Aw. Thank you. Is that Ruby? Look, look. It's her. She's so pretty. Hi, Ruby. Fellow krakens, here at last is my granddaughter. After 15 years, Princess Ruby has finally returned home to be my successor. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna be a, a what now? Ruby, you're a princess. Address the crowd. I think... I am having a panic attack! Panic attack! So, Grandma... Uh, "Grandmamah." It goes up on the second "mah." Oh, sorry. Um, Grandmamah, um, you have the wrong person. I'm just Ruby Gillman, normal teenager. Normal according to who? The women in our family have been gifted the mighty power to turn into giant kraken. You are only one of three giant krakens on this Earth, Ruby. We must protect the ocean and its creatures. But many monsters have coveted our position and have tried to seize the throne for themselves. Brag alert, they never succeeded. The Leviathan, Umibozu, and the most power-hungry and dangerous of them all... The mermaid? Yes, the mermaid! But people love mermaids. Of course they do. People are stupid. Mermaids are selfish, vain narcissists with mediocre hair, and their queen, Nerissa, the worst of them all. She wanted to control the ocean and force its creatures to serve her and her alone. Normally, mermaids would be no match for us giant kraken... Much too puny... But their queen found an ancient weapon, the Trident of Oceanus. The only weapon powerful enough to defeat a giant kraken. We formed the front lines against her, and for that... we paid a terrible price. Frankly, I suppose we'd all be kelp toast if it wasn't for your mother. No way. That's my mom? Was she actually cool? She was our greatest warrior. I mean, of course she was. I taught her everything I know. She engaged in a great battle with the tyrant mermaid and wrested away the Trident. I called it her "queen-making moment." It was glorious. Nerissa fled in disgrace. We had a chance to crush the mermaids forever, but your mother did the unfathomable. She hid the Trident away, left her kingdom, left her kind, all to play human? Whoa. You have laser eyes? Well, it's electrically charged bioluminescence, but, yeah, they do pack a wallop. You have the powers, too, you know. Besides growing big at super awkward moments? You're special, Ruby. You feel it in the core of your being. Let me teach you. But my mom told me that if I stay out of the ocean, I won't turn into a... A giant kraken? You are not a human who turns into a kraken. You're a kraken hiding as a human. Once you know what you're capable of, you'll want to be the next kraken queen. It's your birthright. And fight as you might, fight as you will, you can never outswim your destiny. I don't know, Grandmamah. I like math and Connor. You know, teen stuff. Very well. I loved spending this time with you, Ruby. Me, too. Thank you for telling me the truth. Until we meet again. Wait. You're just gonna let her go? She'll be back. A kraken always answers the call. That's what you said about Agatha. Bye, Clarence. Kraken ahoy! Davey, hard to port. Full power! Fly. Fly, me beauties. Wha... Let's get a closer look at ya. Laser eyes, go! Laser eyes, go! Laser eyes? Hold her steady, Davey. Bit of a spicy tuna, aren't ya? - Wait. Is that...? - The new girl. Oh, my gosh. Hey. Chelsea? H-How are you even down here? Because I'm a motherflippin' mermaid. I figured I owed you an underwater rescue since I kinda, sorta, 100% got credit for yours. Time for the Gordon special. Surprise. It's a bomb! We should get going or, like, die. Your call. Don't say it, Davey. You're such a naysayer. Okay. I still can't believe you're a... A ten with a fin? A fish come true? A mermaid? Ooh, I can't believe I can finally have a friend to share things with. A super sea-girl bestie. Look, Chelsea, thanks for what you did back there, but I started this day thinking that my biggest issue was prom. And now, I got a whole lot more going on. So I just need to go home, get some sleep and pretend this day never happened. Look, I just thought we had a lot in common, but if you're gonna be salty about it, then bye-bye. Okay, Ruby, you got this. You just need to make it to school and have a completely, totally ordinary day. Huh? Honey, you've gotta stop beating yourself up. Oh, Arthur. I can't believe I didn't tell her any of this sooner. I mean, what was I thinking? You were thinking about protecting her, like you always have. What if she drops out of school? I mean, what if she doesn't get a job and runs away like I did? What if she hates me like I hate my mom? It's a slippery slope, Arthur. Hate's a strong word. And she loves you. She'll never run away. Huh. This doesn't help my case. Ruby, hey. How are you feeling? Did you sleep okay? Everything back to normal? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Totally fine. Are you sure? Oh, you look a little flushed. Mom, I'm fine. Really. Ruby, is that salt water on your breath? Salt water? What? No. I really gotta go. Good. Okay. Well, if you do want to talk, I'll be right here. I just... I just really want you to know that you never have to hide things from me. - Hmm, like you? - What did you say, honey? Nothing. Bye, Mom. Love you. Make good choices. ♪ High ♪ ♪ There's a reason for my high ♪ ♪ There's a whole world outside... ♪ It destroyed the YA Zombie Romance section. The YA Zombie Romance section! - Eric. - Yeah. - Take a look at this. - Nonfiction? Mom, I changed my mind. I want to be homeschooled again. I never liked that library anyway. We have a library? Godzilla could not beat that thing in a fight. A tentacled freak from the deep shows up, and I'm supposed to learn math? So gross. There you are! Why'd you stop answering our texts last night? I was worried that monster got to you. I carved us each a whistle out of juniper wood. Blowing it could give you precious seconds to abscond with your lives. Sick. Juniper wood has been known to have kraken-defeating powers. What? Kraken? Why would you say that? Ev-Everyone knows that krakens aren't real, so... Behold, a plot twist. 15 years ago, you all laughed at me. Sorry. Not you, Davey. You're right, you always believed me. But now I finally have proof that krakens exist. A lot of you have been asking about my beard regimen. Kraken! Kraken ahoy! She's back! Oh, she's coming for me. Davey, get the picturephone. Do you see it? With your help, we will drag this abomination into the light and finally reveal what it truly is. Can't help but root for that guy. A great darkness has risen from the depths to claim us all. And this time, she is not catastrophizing. I mean, this is wacky Gordon. You can't take him seriously. He only has, like, ten subscribers. - For now. - Huh? Trevin is sharing it across all of his socials. -He's what? -What? You've never heard of my channel? A lot of people watch my gaming live streams. How many is a lot? About a hundred and forty... thousand. And... video posted. -There, it's out there forever now. -Wait. Kraken! Kraken! Kraken ahoy! Dude, can you believe it? - Kraken! Kraken! - That old boat dude was right. - Kraken ahoy! - That thing is legit a monster. A real-life monster. Ruby? Cue Ruby. Bliss, get the smelling salts. Where are you going? You forgot your whistle! Kraken! Kraken! Kraken ahoy! Kraken! Kraken! - Kraken ahoy! - No running in the halls. With a kraken running loose, you could use a bodyguard. Aw, you're sweet. The monster could be lurking around any corner. I'd fight it for you. Chelsea? Can I talk to you? Okay, everyone out. Private talk time. Bye. So, what's up? Chelsea, about last night, I am sorry that I ran... Oh. Apologies are so corny. Just skip to the part where you tell me everything. Look, I... You are here on land one day, and you already fit in. I've been here all of my life, and I still feel like a freak. I-I just want to be Ruby Gillman, normal teenager. Oh, boo. Where's the fun in that? Ruby, you're a giant kraken. Don't you think you could aim a little bit higher than "normal teenager"? Oh, my cute little, floppy, baby guppy girl. You know what you need? Great hair and a mermaid tail? No, but it would help. What you need, Ruby Gillman, is to see how great your life could be. You need a super sea-girl ditch day! Okay. Let's do it. Yay! Just four more days until prom, the last evening of joy before entering the drudgery of adulthood. - ♪ I bought a ticket to life ♪ - Woo-hoo! - ♪ Rose-colored eyes ♪ - Whoa! ♪ Made a home in halls of mirrors ♪ ♪ It was all fun and games ♪ ♪ Love what I played, but now I see a little clearer ♪ ♪ The more that I see myself ♪ ♪ The less that I know about me ♪ ♪ Was riding the carousel up and down... ♪ This day's been amazing. I mean, seven seas in seven hours? And don't get me started about how wrong they got the crystal jellyfish in the Marine Biologist Quarterly. Sorry. Am I geeking out too much? No. I still can't believe your mom hid all of this from you. "Hiding is surviving." That's the Gillman family motto. Mottoes are stupid. That's my motto. I hate hiding. But you're crushing it at school. Everyone loves you. You really do have everything. No, I don't. Ever since the Battle of the Trident, all us mermaids have been in hiding. I couldn't take it anymore. I felt trapped, so I ran away. But when I ended up at Oceanside High, I was alone. No one could see the real me. And then I found you, my super sea-girl bestie, and now everything is right in the world. If it wasn't for this whole mermaid versus kraken war, you and I could be this free all the time. Oh, sure. Yeah. But, I mean, two teenage girls can't fix history. Wait. What's the first rule of being a mathlete? Hmm. Never talk about being a mathlete? No. We have to evaluate the problem. Chelsea, come on. There must be some way to end this war so you won't have to hide from the krakens and I won't have to become a prophesied princess warrior of an interspecies vendetta. Well, there is one way. Picture this: Chelsea Van Der Zee and Ruby Gillman save the seas by finding the Trident of Oceanus. That giant fork my grandma's so obsessed with? Yes. The Trident. Stay with me. Once we have the Trident, we can show that there doesn't have to be a war anymore. It can be a symbol of peace. Then my grandmother wouldn't have to train me for battle. I can live in the ocean and on land as the real me. No more fighting. And the mermaids wouldn't have to live in fear anymore. No more hiding. - No fighting. - No hiding. No fighting! No hiding! No fighting! No hiding! I'm nervous about the barbecue. Oh, Carol, come on. No one knows what happened exactly to the library. Sam, no headphones at the table. - It's completely gone. - It could have been a gas leak. Trust me, your buyers are gonna love Oceanside's tranquility. Tranquility has turned to terror here in Oceanside as more and more witnesses report having seen the giant kraken. Knock, knock. Who's there? It's Uncle Brill. I'm already inside. Ooh, don't mind if I do. Just one second, Carol. What are you doing here? When I came back empty-handed, Mom hit the roof. I need a place to crash till she cools down. A few months, a couple years. Century, tops. Um, hon, uh, this isn't good. I'm here with Captain Gordon Lighthouse. Now, Mr. Lighthouse, you allegedly claim to have seen... The face of death! Allegedly. - Ow, ow, ow. Ow. - You out there, I need any able-bodied man, woman or child -to help crew my vessel -REPORTER: Get off. Ow! Ooh. And capture the kraken! That guy's terrifying, and I live with a warlord. Aggie, he's got her on video. Agatha, are you still there? What's going on? No, it's nothing. Bring your buyers Saturday. Uh-oh. - She's got that look. - The one where she wants us to do something we don't want to do. I've been searching for kraken me entire life. And it cost me dearly. Oh, fine, yes. But if it wasn't for the kraken, I wouldn't have bought the boat, and without the boat, I wouldn't have mortgaged my house, and if I didn't mortgage my house, Tammy wouldn't have left me. Huh. Been there. Are we still talking about krakens? Gordon, if it's from the ocean, I'm your man. And I can wield this baby, no problem. He knows this should only be handled by a responsible adult. - Ooh, pointy. - And who might you be? Name's Brill. Born of the dirt, live in the dirt, will be buried in the dirt. Don't like water. Hmm. We call him Buckethead. He's not too bright, but he can take a lot of punishment. Impressive. You're hired! Buckethead, you're with me. Ah, now, don't be jelly, Davey. Whoa. What is this place? The Well of Seas. The source of all the ocean's energy. That's where your mother hid the Trident of Oceanus. She did? How did you know that? Because she took it from my mother, the mermaid queen, and hid it in there. My mom died trying to get it back. I am so sorry. It's not your fault. They were enemies. So how are we supposed to get it? Each current has its own force, its own power. You have to swim through all of the currents to get to the center where the Trident is hidden. Only a giant kraken can survive it. It has to be you, Ruby. Okay. It's just an underwater volcano of death. So, step one: Evaluate the problem. Okay. The problem is bad. It's really bad. Uh, we might need some help. Ruby. Oh, what a surprise. Show me how to use my powers. Oh, I thought you'd never ask. Okay, where do we start? -Laser eyes? -Before you fly through the ocean, you must first learn to swim. You know my swimming is pretty good, so maybe I could skip ahead and we could unleash my laser eyes. Pew, pew. Pew, pew. Whoa. You must accept your "kraken-ness" and leave your land self behind.

Chelsea, you're my super sea-girl bestie. It's gonna be fine. - No fighting. - No hiding. A stick snack? - A stick snack? - Get your stick snack. Can I offer you a stick snack? Stick snack for he? Stick snack for she? Hey, Gary. Make sure you check out the pool house. Oh, Agatha, you were right. What was I ever worried about? I told you, Carol. There's no better place to raise a family. Now, if you'll excuse me. There she is. Aggie, I'm so proud of you. This is everything you've worked for all these years. Well, I couldn't have done it without my... kraken crew. Say, have you heard from... Ruby. Hey, stranger. I knew you'd make it. Mom, I need to talk to you about something big. Is it about prom? Because... No. And yes. But no. It's about something so much more than prom. The ocean. Peace. Happiness. We want all the same stuff you wanted, and we have a plan. - But we need your help. - We? I want you to meet my super sea-girl bestie, Chelsea. Ah. What is going on, Ruby? Before you freak out, she is a mermaid, but you're gonna love her. Inside. Now. Ruby, you have to listen to me. You don't understand the danger you're in. We left the ocean because of a mermaid. Don't worry. She's not like her mom. - Her mom? - The mermaid queen. She's the mermaid queen's daughter? Yeah, but she's my friend. She is not your friend. She is dangerous. You sound like Grandmamah. I'm sorry. I sound like who? Grandmamah. She's been training me. She told me why you left. Training you? For what? Mom, don't you see? This is our chance to fix everything. Ruby, you are in over your head. You do not know the whole story. And whose fault is that? Hey, I tried to talk to you. I wanted to tell you everything sooner, but I also needed to keep you safe and give you a normal life. Normal? Normal isn't hiding in this fake town, living a fake life. I sacrificed everything to give you this "fake life." I'm not gonna hide anymore! Oh. No, no, no, no, no. Brill! Distraction. Hey, everybody. Um, watch how high I can throw my nephew. Where'd he go? Ta-da! We are gonna change the world with or without you. Ruby, I get it. You're angry. You want to fight. So did I when I was your age. But trust me, this is the wrong fight. You're on the wrong side. You can't tell me how to live my life. Oh, yes, I can. I am still your mother. You are forbidden from going in the ocean again. Now go home and calm down! Agatha, are you okay? What happened? Ruby's made friends with Nerissa's daughter. Oh, no. And my mother has been training her. 15 years, and she still has her tentacles around me. What about Ruby? Oh, she hates me right now. Go find her. Make sure she's safe. I'm gonna deal with my mother. Ruby, wait. Are you okay? What happened back there? My mom just wants things to stay the same. She wants me to stay the same. But this time, I'm not turning back. Mother! And here I thought I knew how to make an entrance. Stay away from my daughter. You mean my granddaughter? The princess? The heir to the throne? Still trying to get your way. Some things never change. You're trying to force your daughter into a life she doesn't want. Now, where have I heard that before? The difference is I didn't raise my daughter to be a reflection of my glory. Well, that's certainly true. You raised her to run away and hide. You still think I was scared to fight. You think it was easy to start over? To risk everything? I never stopped fighting. I fight for my family. I fight for who I love. You? You just love to fight! She's just a kid. A sweet, naive kid. And now she's in trouble. She made friends with a mermaid. - What? - Yes. The daughter of the mermaid queen. Daughter? Nerissa never had a daughter. Ruby. We did it. I've waited 15 years for this. 15 years of waiting to get revenge on your mother... What? Dethrone your grandmother and lay waste to the kraken kingdom. Chelsea? Oh, there is no Chelsea. I am Nerissa. What's... What's happening to you? Surprised? I'm a flippin' mermaid. And you're just a dumb teenager. All that rah-rah-rah was so that you could free this for me, me, me.

Are you here to help me kill the monsters? - No. That's my wife. - What? But if she is a... and-and you're her... that means... Please don't kill me, kraken monster. Pull yourself together, man. We've got a mermaid to hunt. Thanks. I needed that. Where is my daughter? Oh, we already said our goodbyes. But not before she gave me this. The greatest warrior in the sea, hiding amongst humans. What a waste. No one talks to my daughter like that. Except me. You've grown older, Queen. Older and meaner. Lucky for me, mermaids don't age. Well, I hope you both put up more of a fight than Ruby. Ruby? Ruby? Ruby! Don't worry. I'll get you out of here... slowly. I will get you out of here slowly. Oh, no. What happened? Getting the Trident was supposed to make things better, but all I did was ruin everything. My mom was right. I should have just gone home like she said... gone back to hiding and stayed small. What? No. Ruby, that's not what your mom meant. I promise. You weren't there. Well, I may not know a lot about a lot, but I know my sister. Growing up, I was so proud to be her brother. She was powerful, confident. Everyone loved her. But then she left, and I could never understand why she chose to leave the ocean until I saw the awesome life she created on land. And I realized, your mom chose her own path. She chose you. It's time to destroy that Trident once and for all. Yeah! Go get her, kiddo! Whoa! I'll be right there. Don't wait up, though. Oh, it feels so good to be back. And this time, I'm getting rid of you for good. Stay away from my mother! Ruby Gillman? Pause. Rewind. Ruby? You should be dead. Picture this.

It's the exponential growth formula. We've got to shoot it more and longer. Trust me, I'm a mathlete. It doesn't have to end like this. Just give up the Trident. You'll never get this away from me. Maybe I can't, but we can. No! Woo-hoo! Go, Ruby! Woo-hoo! Now, that's a successful monster hunt. We got us a little mermaid, Davey! Please. Please, please, please. I'm not evil.
