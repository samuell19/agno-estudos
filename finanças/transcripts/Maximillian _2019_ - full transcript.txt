(BRIGHT MUSIC) (MAN BREATHING) SAGE: Max. Max, do you hear me? Max. (CLOCK TICKING) WATCHER: I'm here to see Mr. Vargas. Yes, give me one second. Mr. Vargas, someone is here to see you. I'll take that. He'll be with you in just one minute. (CLOCK TICKING) WATCHER: You wanted to see me, sir? Yes. I have, you know. Has been good to you and your team. My team. We built something extraordinary. WATCHER: What's wrong, sir? VARGAS: It's appearing that one of those shadows is shoddy. (CLOCK TICKING) (GENTLE MUSIC) (CART RATTLING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Man, go away, I'm sleeping. (ELEVATOR BEEPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I mean, what do you mean by that? My team is smart, precise, resourceful, and loyal. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (MAN SNEEZING) CUSTOMER: What the hell, man? MAX: Oh, I'm sorry, man. I have allergies. (MAN COUGHING) VARGAS: Well, one of them isn't smart enough to be present in the circle. WOMAN: Somebody call 911. Oh my God. Why they pretend to be loyal? How do you know? (HAND KNOCKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What's your problem? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) The real question. What are you going to do about it? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) I had him. I swear I had him. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I mean, I wasn't gonna let him hurt you. I don't know how this could happen. I mean, they were home grown, so there's no way to be infiltrated from the outside. I handpicked them myself. I mean, they are what they are because of me. None of them did what they do now before I found them. VARGAS: What do you have in mind? WATCHER: There's only one solution. Eliminate the problem. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (ELEVATOR BEEPING) What do you need from me? Men. To cover exits and to wear them out before we make 'em kill each other. (SOFT MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) VARGAS: Make them kill each other. I like it. It's twisted, but I like it. Just give me the men. I'll take care of the rest. Okay, consider it done. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) It's a shame that his only weakness is how much he trusts me. Well. Once Shadows are dead. Kill Watcher. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Yes, sir. Watcher and Shadow cannot be dead soon enough. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SOFT MUSIC) Bro. You knew when the meds wore off that I would be back. And for crying out loud, please brush your teeth. Smells like a bag of shit just hit my face. So what did I miss, hm? Safe career? Golf, maybe tennis now. You must have 'cause we're still alive. Right? Right? I get it. You still don't know what to do with the rest of your life. Well has it ever occurred to you that I want to live? Yes, no, maybe. Check the box. Okay, you're going to ignore me. I see. Very well then. I'm just going to sit here and make annoying sounds until you talk to me. Ah. No, no, no. No laffy. No taffy. What do you think Mom would think of us? About us killing people and stuff? What would Jesus do? You think God would take a liking to us killing people? You don't care. Besides, we haven't went to church in years. I'm a Raisin Bran man myself. Are you listening to me? You know one of these days we're not gonna be able to talk to each other all because you want to play kill a ninja. Who you think you are, hm? Chunoby. Street Fighter. Ken. Oh, you must be Ryu. Hadouken. Fool, you ain't nothing. And what is this here? This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Please change the channel. Ah. Turn it to PBS. (BRIGHT MUSIC) Well, last night was fun, wasn't it? If you say so. I had him, you know. You didn't have to take the shot. Seriously? That's not what I was talking about. You're still upset about that? It's not a competition. I did it to protect you. (BRIGHT MUSIC) You're all we have in this world. I have something to tell you. Pay attention. You're right though. I'd have done the same thing. I love you. Ugh. You know that's what pizza's for, right? (BRIGHT MUSIC) WOMAN: Keep it going. (PHONE BEEPING) Yeah. Right now? You got it. (BRIGHT MUSIC) And why won't you keep this place clean? Just the other day I seen two roaches having sex with each other and they had a baby and called it Bambi. This is why we don't have a girlfriend or a life for that matter. The Jergens bottle. It was already basically used when you last seen it. Hey, let's go on another date with Mr. Wack It today. Oh look, our favorite baseball team is on. The Yankees. Oh, it's two minutes past the self pleasure hour. Ha ha. (PHONE BUZZING) Watcher. What's up? (SOFT MUSIC) What now? Yeah. All right. (SOFT MUSIC) Oh, there he goes again. Went back into the other room. Into the mist. (BRIGHT MUSIC) (GENTLE MUSIC) This is weird. Yeah, something's odd. You know what, Max? Maybe we should really rethink this thing and turn back around and go home, right? Plus I have to go pee. The way you been treating me this morning I should just piss on you. Right there. Clearly something is not right here. (GENTLE MUSIC) Hello, Shadows. I've called you here tonight for a very important session. One that might be your last. You will have three rounds that you will have to survive. Survive meaning the last one alive. What? Round one will be against the many guards you here tonight. Round two you will have to face off against each other. Round three will be announced after the results of the first two rounds. Is he serious? He expects us to go through with this? Are doors are sealed and guarded heavily. You will not be able to escape. There are weapons hidden throughout the warehouse to be used at your disposal. The last man or woman who makes it to my office wins. You see? I told you we should've left. I told you. Now we 'bout to die all because you didn't listen to me. I'll never get to see Lebron James lose the rest of his hair. I'll never have that threesome with Bunny and X. I'll never get to see the Browns go to the Superbowl. Wait a minute. Browns will never go to the Superbowl. They suck. (GENTLE MUSIC) I'm sorry that it has to be this way, but one of you have left me with no choice. Round one begins now. I need you to make it through this, Max. (GENTLE MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Well, well, well. Look what we have here. Me, I'm mad. Look at me, I'm Max. I can do mad face. Wait, wait. Think it's a game, don't you? Bite your damn nose off. Got me down here like a four year old toddler. (GENTLE MUSIC) Now. (GUNS FIRING) (GENTLE MUSIC) I'm out. (GUNS FIRING) (BRIGHT MUSIC) One in the chamber. (BRIGHT MUSIC) (GUNS FIRING) This is bullshit. What did he mean one of us left him no choice? (BRIGHT MUSIC) Blowticious. Skeevee. Delicious. You don't find it a little bit suspicious that no one has gone in this door. Don't you watch any movies? (BRIGHT MUSIC) - Oh shit. - Oh shit. You boys lost? Let me help you find your way. (BRIGHT MUSIC) Dammit. (SOFT MUSIC) Junk. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I got this. Let me show you how it's done. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BOMB EXPLODING) You see? I told you. That could've been us. Messed up my H&M suit. What happened? Where's Bunny? I don't know. Should we look for her? No. We keep moving. Watcher owes us answers. Something isn't adding up. He's right. We'll find her later. She'll be fine. Sure Max, lead the way. MAN: What's wrong? (SOFT MUSIC) Hello. Hello? Tonight, we take the master for a test drive. It's about damn time. I need that job done. I can't wait. Do you think your guy can handle it? Just tell us the target. The target are Shadows. Okay, but we want the pay upfront. Okay. Hold on. (SOFT MUSIC) Done. Check your account. (SOFT MUSIC) Well consider it done. (SOFT MUSIC) Would you two hurry up? It's your turn. (GUN FIRING) (MEN LAUGHING) Why you want them dead? They're your own team. They've gotten you out of some serious jams before. Hell, most of the other crime families are afraid of you because of them. I create a sleeping dragon. I must say. Wanted to sleep before it's realized. Power. (SOFT MUSIC) What do you think is gonna happen when the dragon realizes it was you that woke it up? Sorry. MAN: You're out of it.

(SOFT MUSIC) This is bullshit. He says one of us is the reason for all this. We'll be fine. We've been through some tough times before. Everything will be all right. I'm pregnant. What? Now? No, later. Yes now. That's what I was trying to tell you at lunch. (SOFT MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Round two has begun. You will face off against each other in a fight to the death. It ends only when one of you is left breathing. Motivation for your task. There's a mole amongst you. Trust only your instincts to survive. Don't let me down, Max. A mole? That's what he said. Let's kill ourselves a mole. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) What's your problem? Didn't you hear? Round two started. We have to do this. No, we don't. We're gonna get to Watcher's office and find out what's going on. So we can get blown up again? He has a valid point there, too. Leave me alone. SAGE: You shut up. Oh, I get it. You probably knew about that bomb, didn't you? Watcher probably told you about it. He always liked you anyway. You probably were gonna trick me to going in there. Weren't you? Something a dirty mole would do. Wait, what? Son of a bitch. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Bunny, come on. We're a team, remember? We shouldn't. Can't do this. Guess she's alive, right? She wouldn't turn on the team unless. She's the mole. Come on, Bunny. We're like family. We are family. Please don't do this. We'll make you the godmother of our baby. That's what you're gonna offer her? Our unborn child? Would you stop? I was trying to help here. Help? Oh great. Hey psycho who kills people and doesn't even speak, you wanna be the guardian of our child if you don't kill us? Great plan, honey. Great plan. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Bunny, you're such a bitch. I never liked you anyway. Bunny, my ass. She's a mole. Sh, don't say that. Bunny. It's just the hormones talking. She didn't mean it. Don't shush me. And why are you defending her? I'm your wife. Don't make me do this. It's probably against my better judgment to say this, but you probably want to play it safe and kill his ass. I'm gonna enjoy watching you die. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Gin, stop. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'll show you hormones. Sh. (GENTLE MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) (GENTLE MUSIC) No, no, no, no, no. No. (SOFT MUSIC) No. (GUN FIRING) (SOFT MUSIC) You were right. I should've left a long time ago. Should've tried to be normal. But I'm good at it. And I've never been good at anything. Watcher found me in a bad situation. And I owed Vargas. So it was either this or die so I stayed. (SOFT MUSIC) He gave me a family and I was sick of being a lonely loser. But you have to move forward. It's time for you to take control. Take your life back. Don't you mean we? (SOFT MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUNS FIRING) (SOFT MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) You better be calling to tell me it's done. Tell me how you know. Knowledge. It's a funny thing, Watcher. What you want me to say? I know. There was no mole. Fine. There was no mole. I did that because I knew the time to disappear and eliminate Shadows. Something. You knew as well but you were too weak to do it. I hope you burn in hell. Hey. Something tell me that you will be beat me there. Don't forget. Save me a seat, fucker. (SOFT MUSIC) Why? Look, I know you have a lot of questions. Why? Why did you do this to us? It was Vargas. He said there was a mole. My gut told me it couldn't have been true. I don't know why I didn't go with it sooner. Why didn't you vouch for us? Why did you go along with it? I don't know. I didn't know what to believe. It felt wrong from the beginning. You were like a father to me. And you a son. I see so much of myself in you. I knew you would be the one that walked through that door. This is more than you even realize. They. Us. We were family. We are. To die by your hand would be an honor, son. (SOFT MUSIC) Did you mean everything you just said? Every word. (SOFT MUSIC) What's next? We get Vargas. (SOFT MUSIC) Hey yeah, so do you remember that guy we hit just before we got here? Totes. Yeah, but you said I could have that. I know. I always do that. Yeah, yeah you do. Yeah, you do. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) All of 'em. So what's the plan? Kill these son of bitches. (GENTLE MUSIC) (GUNS FIRING) Watcher. (GUN FIRING) (GENTLE MUSIC) Let's go. (GENTLE MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Who are they? The masters. Don't worry about it. They won't be a problem. Just follow my lead. We have no beef with you. Just turn a blind eye and let us pass. I didn't think his head would come off. I didn't think he was just gonna stand there. (SOFT MUSIC) That was your friend. (GUN FIRING) (BRIGHT MUSIC) So what? Wanna play hide and seek now? Little mix. Can't hide forever. (SOFT MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) (SOFT MUSIC) (BRIGHT MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) (BRIGHT MUSIC) (SOFT MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) It is very difficult for me to step on an insect without crushing it. I'm what bitch?
