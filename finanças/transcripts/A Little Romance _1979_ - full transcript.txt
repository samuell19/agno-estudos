It's a time-honored profession. An older one than yours. Besides, you've had thousands of dollars worth on the house as they say. - Bingo. - Bingo. Bingo! I hope, Mr. Secretary, with this signing... ...France and the United States will begin a whole new era in our relations. The president wanted to be here, but his wife... Look out! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! What are they doing in my shot? Would you get them out? - Isn't somebody posted out there? - I'll see what happened. Help yourself. Would you get them the hell out of here? Okay. Have we seen the doors yet? - I don't think... - No. Yes. - I don't... I'm not sure. - Lucy! Have we seen the doors in any shot yet? - No. - Okay. Leave the doors shut. Shut. I think. Look, what's that damn redhead's name? - Monique. - Monique. You're nowhere near emotional enough. He murdered your husband. You gotta have tears. - I can't cry if I don't have menthol. - I don't like using phony stuff. - It's got to come out of the moment. - I'm using menthol in my crying scene. You don't have a crying scene. Okay, let's take it from the top! Makeup, could you get a menthol ball for Monique? - Hi, Lauren. - Hi. - Enjoying yourself? - Makeup! Flying in! Monique, look, I've changed my mind... Lauren? Lauren? Call me Bogie. - Why? - Because... All right. No talking. Quiet on the set. Hold it. Hold it. Are the squibs set? Special effects? When Monique fires, I want that mirror behind Brod to shatter. Because they belong together. Lauren and Bogie. - Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart. - It's a 12 million dollar picture. You gonna tell me I can't break one goddamn mirror? They were married. Movie stars. She called him Bogie. That's why I said to call me Bogie. Lucy, can I get a script over here? - What are you reading? - Nothing. Lauren, darling. What are you doing back here? I bring you to watch the shooting, and you sit with a book. - I got bored. - How could you possibly be bored? George is one of the finest directors in the world. I find this fascinating. I could have done this goddamn picture in Spain, you know. Can you believe this? A 12 million dollar picture and they won't let me break one frigging mirror! Sorry. I'm not used to having kids on the set. It's nothing she doesn't hear every day at school. I can show you the setup through the camera. Oh, I'd love it. You had it. You had it. Your mother? She's very attractive. Is she an actress? - No. - I thought maybe you came to watch her. No. She came out here to watch him. - George De Marco. - You know him? Sure. Bloody Tuesday, Lips, The Dandelion Train. I don't go to movies much. Is he good? - He stinks. - Really? - He's the worst. - You're not just saying that? The only people who like his movies... ...are two critics in Paris and one in Pakistan. I have to go. It was good talking to you. Maybe I'll see you again sometime. Right. So long, sweetheart. - I didn't know you knew French. - I've lived here three years. - How come you speak English? - School, but movies mostly. I like the American ones. It's beautiful here, no? It's awful places like this were built when so many Frenchmen were starving. This is fabulous chicken. You're lucky to have a mother who can cook. I don't have a mother. I made this, and my name isn't really Bogie. - I thought you said... - A joke. You see, Humphrey Bogart was married with Lauren Bac... Never mind. My name is Daniel. - You from Paris? - Just outside. La Garenne. You live with your father? What does he do? He sort of drives. - A truck? - No. - A taxi. - You shouldn't be embarrassed. - It's honest work. - Not the way he does it. - You have a father, or just a mother? - I have a father. I'm on my third. - Does she divorce or just kill them? - They're still alive. What does the latest one do? - He's in telephones. - Telephones? What does he do exactly? Exactly, he's the head of ICT. In Europe. - So you're a capitalist. - My father's a capitalist. My own politics are more radical. It's easy to be liberal when you're rich. I've seen it in films. Kid! Your mother's got half the crew looking for you! - I have to go. - Me too. - Thanks for the lunch. - My pleasure. - We can meet somewhere in Paris. - When? - Next week? - When next week? - Monday. - Okay! - Where? - Where do you live? Neuilly. I see you at the gare St. Lazare, the train station, 3:00, Monday. Under the clock. Bingo! Did you have fun out at that chateau today? How's our friend George? He was so busy directing, he barely said hello. He's so inventive. It's fascinating to watch him. He has such a rapport with the actors and the crew. Could you tell, darling? May I be excused, please? Don't you want dessert? I gotta call Natalie and get the homework. On Friday night? Don't be such a drudge. - Watch some television. - I missed a whole day of school. I really don't want to get behind. Excuse me. She spent the time reading. Shouldn't she be more interested in watching a movie being made? Depends on the book. I don't know what to do. I hoped she'd enjoy herself. She spent the whole time reading. Natalie? Lauren. What happened in school today? We played soccer with the boys. Billy and another boy chose girls... ...to be on their team. Can you imagine how nervous I was? - He's your cousin. - Second cousin. The kids don't come out funny. I checked. - Did he pick you? - No. How can you have kids if he won't even pick you for soccer? In two years I'll fill out, my mother says. Then he'll pick me. It's a start anyway. - What's the math homework? - Pages 226 through 232. God, it's so hard! And Mr. Stuart gave us an awful test! He says you're going to have to make it up on Monday after school. - Oh, no. - Well that's what he said. - I can't. I just can't. - Why not? - I met a boy. - I can't stand it! Who is he? - His name is Daniel. - He's French! God, what else? He lives in La Garenne and his father drives a cab. - A cab? Your mother will have a fit. - Lf she finds out. - You'd better not tell her. - Are you in love? You don't fall in love with a boy you just met. Are you? - Yeah. - Are you gonna see him again? - I don't know if I can. - You'll see what I've been through. You don't know love until you fall for your cousin. - Second cousin. - Right. - Gotta go. See you Monday. - Goodbye. Reading something you don't want me to see? - It's just a book. - I used to read those too. What is it? An Introduction to Metaphysics, by Martin Heidegger. School has changed since I was in seventh grade. - I'm just reading it for fun. - Fun? Heidegger? Why were you hiding it from me? Most people think anyone who reads Heidegger is weird. I don't. But I have to admit that philosophy was never... ...one of my strong subjects in college. Heidegger. You really understand that? Heidegger isn't all that hard. His stuff is mostly etymological. Like, "Why is there something rather than nothing at all?" You seemed a little distracted at dinner. Anything wrong? No, not really. - Nothing happened that upset you? - No. I thought this summer we'd all take a trip together. You and your mother and myself. We could go to Germany. - We've never been there together. - That'd be nice. - Maybe you could meet Heidegger. - He died three years ago. - We probably don't want to bother him. - No. Damn rich American girls. They keep you waiting. I'll count to 20, and if she's not here by that time... ...the hell with her. One, two... That's too fast. One. Two. Three. Four. I speak English. Don't strain yourself. - God! I'm so glad I found you! - Where is she? - You'd never, ever find her again. - What's your name? - My name? Natalie Woodstein. - Natalie, where is she? - Oh, yeah. She can't come. - Why not? She got kept after school for a test. We've got this mean... - Did she say when we could meet? - Can you come Wednesday instead? - Okay. - Okay. - She wants to know where. Here? - No, this is no good. Tell her: The Arc de Triomphe du Carousel, in front of the Louvre. - The Arc de Triomphe. - No! Not the big one. - The small one in front of the Louvre. - In front of the Louvre. Oh! That's the museum Louvre, right? Okay. Thank God she got it right. I was afraid you'd be at the other Arc de Triomphe... ...while I was down here cursing you. - Natalie's okay. She's just kind of terminally dense. She's the only one in the school I can stand... - Something the matter with your foot? - No. It's just new shoes. They didn't have my size, but I liked them. - They're very nice. - Thanks. - You sure you're all right? - Fine. Okay, then why don't we mosey on down here a piece? Let me carry your books. You know... Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. I do that myself all the time. Heidegger? - Oh, it's for school, an assignment. - They assigned you Heidegger? - Sure. - They are teaching you existentialism? Heidegger isn't really an existentialist. He claims he isn't. His writing says he is. - You read Heidegger? - Not anymore. He bores me. Especially his fascination with the tall German poet... - What's his name? - HÃ¶lderlin! Ever struggle through that stuff... ...like "The Death Of Empedocles"? It's awful. I bet the French translation is terrible. - It's terrible in any language. - I know! That's fantastic! What's your IQ? - I don't know. - You mean you've never been tested? - No. - Why not? - I'm afraid I might find out I'm... - What? A genius or something weird. Well, people don't exactly love smart kids. I know. I'm 167 IQ. I won't tell anybody. And I read Heidegger because I want to, not for school. I was lying. I lie all the time. You have to. - Are you good at math? - I'm sensational! Especially things like probability. - I've won 850,000 francs on the horses. - 850,000? Just on paper, naturally. That's fantastic! Fabulous! - You are English! - No, I'm American. I love Americans! I was stationed there for a time. Washington. You have been there? - Once when I was little. - Extraordinary city. Very like Paris in many ways. - You sure you're all right now? - Perfectly, my dear. Allow me to present myself. Julius Edmond Santorin, retired. To show there's no hard feelings... ...will you join me in a hot chocolate and pastry? - I know a delightful spot nearby. - No, thank you. We... Okay. Good. It's years since I was in Washington, but I have many fond memories. We'll have lots to talk about. I've never been there. I'm from La Garenne. I have been there too. Come along! And so, Emilienne, we had not been married very long... ...and she was not all that sophisticated coming from Provence... ...was offered vodka by the Russian ambassador... ...and she, thinking it was water and following the other guests... ...swallowed it straight back. You can't imagine her surprise! I shall never forget her expression. You were the ambassador to the United States? I was simply a humble attachÃ© at the embassy. I didn't become ambassador until the end of my career. Then it was Liechtenstein. Delightful spot... ...but hardly the top of the diplomatic ladder. Oh, that's fantastic! What an incredible life you must have had. Please. Julius. - You make me feel my years less. - How old are you? No longer young, Daniel. No longer young. - Your wife Emilienne? - She has been gone 12 years now... ...to this very day. I was on my way to the cemetery... ...when I ran into a large, round object. A football, I think it is called. - I never saw it. - I said I was sorry. She won't mind my being a little late. I go to see her every week... ...with all the breath, smiles and tears of all of my life. - And if God choose... - And if God choose... ...I shall but love thee better after death. - You know it? - Elizabeth Browning, my favorite poet. - She was ours too. - Fantastic! Yes! She's no longer so much in the fashion... ...but how we loved her. I'll tell you a little story. When Emilienne and I lived in Venice... ...we rented a small villa. One Sunday the plumbing went out... ...and I couldn't get a plumber so I went down to make some repairs myself. And crawling about in the dark I came upon some papers. Poetry. - Have you guessed? - No. We had been living in the Brownings' villa and didn't know it! - Fantastic! Were they new poems? - No, mostly drafts... ...which improved when they were published. Some of the Sonnets from the Portuguese... ...and pages from a journal she kept describing the people they met... ...the places they went, the trips to the Lido... ...the kiss under the bridge. - What bridge? There is an old Venetian legend which says that... ...if two lovers kiss in a gondola under the Bridge of Sighs... ...at sunset when the bells of the campanile toll... ...they will love each other forever. And they did? She died in his arms some years later. And you and Emilienne? The legend is true. - Isn't he the most incredible person? - Incredible. I mean, what a life he's had. He's so dear, so sensitive, you know? Don't you think so? Isn't he wonderful? Yes, he is wonderful. I'm having a birthday party a week from Friday. I want you to come. Okay. Hi, Mother. Hello, darling. - Hi, Richard. - Hello, sweetheart. How does this sound for the party? Caviar on tiny potato skins, smoked Scotch salmon... ...oysters on the half shell, champagne and Russian vodka? I'd just as soon have cake and ice cream. - What are you talking about? - My party. This is for George's wrap party. Wrap party? - Don't you know any of the jargon? - I guess not. When a movie finishes shooting, there's a wrap party. - You invite the actors, producers, crew. - So we're having them all here? Of course not. I'm just having George, the cast, a few critics... ...friends, the Schwartzes, Bernard Durand, food editor of Le Monde. - When is it? - The 3rd. But that's my birthday. We're not gonna have a party? Shooting ends on the 3rd. On the 4th, everybody's leaving but George. - I'm sorry. - I've got an idea. Lauren can invite some friends to the wrap party. Combine them. Lauren's birthday and George's wrap party. What do you say? - Okay. - Thank you, darling. Okay. In a way, that solves one of my problems. Who is she going to invite to her party? She doesn't have any real friends other than that Natalie. I know. It's been hard for her, being the kind of kid she is... ...living in a foreign country these last few years. - That's why I've changed my mind. - About what? I've accepted that transfer to Houston. We're leaving next month. - We talked about that, and I... - I know. I think we made the wrong decision. For Lauren. And for us. Well, but... But Houston's so... Well... Houston is so... Houston. Until about 500 B.C., the Greeks perfected their carving techniques. You can see these statues are different from those Egyptian statues... ...in their depiction of the human form. Praxiteles, for example, is a master. See how he really shows the anatomy as it is. Notice the detail of the musculature. Over here, on the other hand, we have Doriphor by Polyclitus... ...and a perfectly splendid example of the school of Athens... ...the magnificent Torso of Apollo. The strength of Greek sculpture is due... Have you ever seen a real one? One what? Sure. Whose? His? - Whose? - You know, his. Daniel. Sure. God! Have you ever, you know? Done it? - All the time, every which way. - God, Lauren! I would've preferred to have waited, but you know the French. Works like this aren't mentioned by the classical Greek... Where? - Where what? - Did you do it? There's this old mattress in his cellar, and we... God! As we come downstairs, we'll see on our left the Apollo Belvedere. The original is in the Vatican. It was supposed to show the ideal model of a man's body. Note the bow in the extended arm and the head turned sideways... ...as if following the arrow with his eyes. This is only a replica, not a very good one. Let's proceed to a later period. I want you to come to my birthday party on Friday. Invite me over to your place tomorrow night. What for? I don't really want you to invite me over. I wanna go out with Daniel. I wanna tell my mother I'm at your place doing homework. When you're supposed to be at my house... ...I suppose you'll be doing it in the mattress in the cellar! I was teasing you. We've never done anything except go to the movies. - Really? - Really. He's never even touched me. If you ever do, promise to tell me about it? Okay. Three seconds of bare ass and they won't let us in. We'll take our business where we're treated like adults! - We don't have to do this. - Yes, we do. Have you seen those movies before? Sure. Londet's father owns this porno house. We go all the time. - That was it? - Yes. - Why did we go past it? - You'll see. Just follow Londet. They get right to it. I just noticed there aren't any subtitles. I sort of get the gist of it anyway. She's so pretty. Why would she...? What is he making her do? I've never seen one of those before either. I wouldn't have taken you. It isn't like that. That's something else. It isn't love. I used to think... ...maybe a long time ago, like... ...like in the time of the pharaohs... ...or Louis XIII... ...that there was somebody... ...made just perfect for me. I mean, when you think about it... ...and consider that your feelings of love... ...begin when you're about 10... ...and if you live to, say, 70... ...well, that's pretty limiting, because what chance is there... ...that he'll be alive at the same time you are? I feel the same thing. I mean, even if she lived in my lifetime... ...what if my perfect woman lived in India or California or Brazil? What chance is there that I meet her when I live in La Garenne? - It's incredible, isn't it? - Absolutely. Incredible. A six-month shooting schedule must be killing you. Hey, Brod. Brod! I'm so flattered that you could come. George told me you never show up at these affairs. What the hell? The booze is free and maybe I'll get laid. He is such a delight. All next week, it'll be mixed soccer. Billy Duchin will be permanent captain. Yesterday, I bribed him to pick me at least once. God! Isn't it romantic? - Having a good time? - Fine. - You could have invited more friends. - They were busy. - Billy Duchin and Jimmy Ford could come. - I don't want them. I barely know them. Sorry it's not much of a birthday party. It's no big deal. - Yes? - We came to see Lauren. Lauren. Lauren! - Hi, Daniel. - Hi. I brought Londet. - Bonsoir, Londet. - Good night, yes. Mother, this is Daniel Michon and his friend, Londet. Londet, this is Natalie. Lauren thought you weren't coming. I'm her father. Good to meet you, sir. Lauren speaks highly of you. I'm delighted you could come. Thank you for exciting me. Why don't we go up to my room? What a lovely idea. Go on ahead. I don't know, letting Frenchmen in your daughter's room. Could be dangerous, huh? - Yes. I don't. - Is it okay that I brought Londet? Sure. He and Natalie are made for each other. With her French and his English, they won't understand a word. This is your room? It doesn't look like you. I know. My mother decorated it. The only thing here that's me is me. - What'd he say? - He sleeps in a bed with his sister. God, how awful! She's great-Iooking and has huge boobs. What'd he say? He said he has a great amount of affection for her. - Where'd you get that? - We can't toast your birthday with Coke. - Great, come on. - I'm not having any. At least try some, Natalie. - I like your father. - Richard? Yeah. He's nice. Why you call him Richard? I called the first two "Daddy." It's easier to lose a Richard than a father. Here's looking at you, kid. Come on. My birthday. You drink champagne. God! - Happy birthday, Lauren. - Happy birthday, Lauren. Look, presents! Let's open the presents. - Okay. - Let's open your gifts. It's a book. It's Nancy Drew and the Ghost of Blackwood High. - Hope you don't already have it. - No. It's one I missed. Thanks, Natalie. You can't give this up. I want you to have it. I couldn't get one of Heidegger. God! Lauren. God. Thank you, Londet. What I find absolutely devastating about your work... ...is the way you go beyond the rationally acceptable. You're looking for art in that beyond, wanting the unknown... ...the dangerous, to take over. You're such a reckless artist. You're almost irresponsible. Yes, but just when you think you're totally out of control... ...you suddenly astound us by making us... ...face our innermost frustrations. - Right. I'm glad you got that. Many people don't get that in my work. Shooting a film is the easy part. Hey, kid, how'd you do? Did you score? I heard a story about a French boy... - You apologize to her! - It was a joke! Your jokes are as rotten as your movies. The winner and new champ by TKO. Hell of a right hand there, kid. Like when you hit Ward Bond in Sin Town. - Who? - Ward Bond. - In what? - Sin Town. Don't you remember? Ward Bond. Sin Town. I'm fine. He caught me, I just wasn't ready. Lauren, upstairs to your room immediately. You, out. - Simmer down. - I want him out. - My coat is upstairs. - Get it! Dinner is served, everyone! They've been drinking! Richard, he's gotten her drunk! - What have you gotten into? - Wait a minute, Kay! Hey, kid. Are you sure that wasn't Richard Widmark I belted? No. You never made a picture with Widmark. I didn't? What is going on...? Jesus Christ, Richard! Get in here! - They've been having an orgy! - Don't be ridiculous! What were you doing? We had champagne and I opened my gifts. Gifts? Some gift! - I'd better go with Londet. - Au revoir, Natalie! Lauren! It wasn't all... You are never to see that boy again, ever. Until school is over. Then it won't matter. We're leaving for the States. The States? Your father took a job in goddamn Houston. We leave at the end of the month. Get used to the idea. - Why now? What's the hurry? - I just wanna be able to see you. It'd be easier if we waited until summer. Then we could take off somewhere. - I don't wanna wait. - Why not? Who knows what'll happen in the summer? I wanna go now. - We'd get caught. - Eventually. - Where would we get money? - I've got Christmas money saved up. Christmas money won't get us far. This is really a terrible movie. All De Marco's movies are terrible. I told you, he stinks. My mother's been watching me like a hawk. This is the only place she'd never suspect we'd meet. You really want to take off now? Maybe we can make it for a week before we get caught. - You mean it? - Where do you wanna go? - Venice. - Why Venice? That's where people go who are in love. - But that's in Italy. It's... - Please? Venice it is. Don't keep me waiting with no money! I couldn't leave without Natalie. She was late. - What did you want? - I've got an idea. - Keep an eye out. - I wanna hear. I helped you sneak out. - Natalie! - I won't move. Don't worry. God, it's him! - She doesn't know what we're planning? - Of course not. How much was that Christmas money you have? - About $ 150. - Okay. Here is my idea. I told you about my system with the horses. - I've won over 850,000 francs. - On paper. I can take your 150 and try to hit a parlay. - How often do you win? - About 45% of the time. - Which means 55% of the time you lose. - I'm not a computer. Would a computer help? Sure. Sure! You can take all the variables for each horse in every race... ...cross-program performances, make out ones for different jockeys... ...different distances... - What's that for? You really are smart, you know? - Yes? - Mr. King, your daughter's here. She is? Send her in. Take these to Kendall. Have him sign them and mail them out. - Hello, sweetheart. - Hi. - To what do I owe this pleasure? - I need a project for science. I chose computers. I was wondering if I could play around with one. - Maybe you could show me. - Because I run this place... ...doesn't mean I know how these machines work. We have people for that. I'll get somebody who understands. - Claudine? - Yes, Mr. King? Take Lauren down to operations... ...and tell Martin that she'll be asking questions. - Of course, Mr. King. - Now, you see? Simple as that. Thanks, Richard. How's Daniel? - Mother told me I can't see him. - I know. You like him? How can I not like somebody who punched George? Martin can see you now, Lauren. Thanks. There we go. Now, Miss King, what kind of information are you looking to get? I want the three horses with the best chance to win... ...each of the eight races at Longchamp tomorrow. I need to program the performance charts for each horse going back for a year. Then I want to cross-correlate the data... ...taking into account the variables of different times and distances. - Forget it. - Why? I've been developing a program to do that for a year. I'm not even close. Would... Would you mind showing me your theory? Show you my theory? Just give you 10 months of my calculations? Is that what you want? You said it isn't working. Maybe I can help you with it. I got it! I got it! Look! - It's useless. - What? I said it's useless. All our work. The whole damn thing. - Why? - Because we are stupid, that's why. I'm stupid. You have to be 18 to place a bet. - You do? - Even if we won, we still couldn't go. - Why not? - We can't cross the Italian border. - Why not? We don't need visas. - They won't let kids across alone. We need an adult. - Are you sure? - Positive. I checked. Can we sneak across? There will be border guards, barbed wire, machine guns. I've seen it in films. I want to go to Venice. I'm not gonna give up this trip. All we have to do is concentrate. - I've got it. I've got it! Come on! - Wait! What is it? Wait! Yes! - Where is he? - I don't know. VoilÃ . We have won all this? Why don't we stop now? We can get to Venice on what we have in great style. Last time I was there, Emilienne and I stayed at the Gritti Palace... ...for 200 francs a day. - Okay. 5000 on number... Five thousand? Five thousand on number six to win. Trip Across. Scratched! Damn! Scratched. - Wait a minute. - Pick the next horse, then. No. Something's wrong here. I should've seen it before. Your computer screwed up. Monaco never did well before... ...and your computer friend picked it to place. Impossible! - Snow Queen. - But the readout... I've won with Snow Queen before. Put it on number two, Snow Queen, to win. Come on. Come on. There is no way that Fille De Fermier could've won that race. No way. It's okay. Don't feel bad. We came close. - Where's Julius? - Getting a drink somewhere, probably. What does it matter? - I'm sorry. - It wasn't your fault. I should have followed your instructions. It was wrong of me. - Whatever the result, I apologize. - What are you talking about? I didn't bet on Snow Queen. At the last moment, I had this sudden hunch. And I put all the money on Fille De Fermier. You mean we won? Fille de fermier in French means "farmer's daughter." Emilienne was a farmer's daughter. Actually, he owned 30,000 hectares... ...but technically, he was a farmer. You're the most wonderful man in the whole world, Julius! I spent a week handicapping these horses and you win on a lousy hunch? I'm afraid so. What does it matter? The important thing is that Lauren gets to Venice to see her poor mother... ...who, at the sight of her, will recover much, much faster, won't she? Would you rather we had lost? If we'd lost we couldn't go, and now we can. If you think Julius is so wonderful, why don't you just go with him? Because Venice wouldn't mean anything to me without you. And he lost all of our baggage, except for two pieces. One containing seven pairs of my shoes... ...and a small case containing all of Emilienne's lingerie. You couldn't buy clothes in Nairobi in those days... ...so for a full week I could change nothing but my shoes... ...and Emilienne, her underwear. And I was furious, but Emilienne just laughed and laughed. She had a very hearty laugh for a small woman. It surprised many people. Well, I think I'll go to the club car for a Dubonnet. - Unless you care to come along? - No, no, you go ahead. Well, I will be back shortly. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Something's wrong. What is it? It's hard to have a good time, knowing my parents might be worried. Why would they be worried about you? They think you're in Mont-Saint-Michel on a field trip for three days. Don't they? So? If Natalie calls they'll find out there's no trip. You were supposed to call her and tell her not to call you. - I forgot. - You forgot? How could you forget that? - There's so much on my mind... - You want to get caught! - That's not true! - Is too! - Is not! - Is too. Is not. Is too. - Hello? - Natalie? - Lauren, where are you? - Why? I called you. Your mom wanted to know why I wasn't in Mont-Saint-Michel. I said, "Why would I be there?" She got all hysterical. She started absolutely pumping me. She talked about calling school. Oh, no. - Lauren. - What? - Why are you at Mont-Saint-Michel? - I'm not. - What are you doing? - Calling Natalie. - Hang up! - Tell my parents I'm okay. - Where are you? - I'm in Italy. I'm okay. - Hello? - Mrs. King? It's Natalie. I just talked to Lauren on the phone. She's in Italy! I guess she got away long enough... - Where in Italy? - I don't know. They made her hang up before she could say. I can't believe you'd do a stupid thing like telling her you're in Italy. - She sounded so worried. - Incredible. - Now where's Julius? - He was in the club car. No, there he is. Julius! - Julius! - You better get him. - Which the great Lucian said: "He may have been an impostor." Julius, the train, it's leaving! I left my money in my vest... ...and my vest is on the train! Halt! Stop! - The money's in his vest! - We've got to get off. But we'll lose the money! The train is going too fast. He'll never make it. - Are you hurt? - I'm okay. - You should have gone without me. - No, we couldn't. The money's on the train. If there's one thing I've learned about life... ...if you miss one train, there's always... What? There is always what? There is always... ...one's feet. It is very kind of you to offer us a lift. You have to be very careful who you pick up on these roads. You could be robbed, you could be kidnapped. - You could be bored to death. - We're tickled pink for the company. We haven't run into anybody that could speak decent English in a week. Right? Where can we drop you folks? We don't want to take you out of your way. - Where are you headed for, Mr? - Duryea. Bob Duryea. Columbus, Ohio. - Columbus. - The missus. We thought we'd spend the night at Verona and then go on to Venice. Well, that'll be just fine. Just fine. She sounded awfully scared and said she was in Italy. I heard a kidnapper tell her to hang up. - Are you sure it's a kidnapping? - Of course it is! You read about them. You're doing nothing! It is a classic case, like in one of my movies. This is life imitating art. The Italian police say your daughter was aboard a train... ...when it stopped at the border in Italy. The telephone company says she called Paris. To me! God! They got off the train in a hurry... ...leaving behind a coat with 18,000 francs. The ransom money! There's no ransom. Nobody's contacted us. She was traveling with two people. One's named Michon. We have no record of him. - Daniel! God, they've got them both. - What? - Michon, that's Daniel's last name. - My God, that filthy French boy! Not that the French are filthy. It's just that this particular French boy... ...is. The man who's with them is another matter. Julius Edmond Santorin. He has a long criminal record. People think Romeo and Juliet... ...were the product of Shakespeare's imagination, that is not so. As a matter of fact, Romeo and Juliet were born right here in Verona. - I don't believe this. - You don't? Excuse me, I didn't mean you. Janet, how many shrimp did you have? - Four. No, five. Five. - That's right. That's what I had. See that guy over there, at the next table, that Italian? He has seven. Don't tell me they don't see Americans coming. Romeo and Juliet came from right here in Verona. Tomorrow we can see Juliet's tomb and the balcony... My wallet! My wallet's been stolen! - Bob! - It's gone! - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure! I put it in this pocket when I cashed a check. - Right, I saw you. That's terrible. - Yes, you did. - How much did he get? - I don't know. Must've been a couple hundred dollars, whatever that is in lira. Damn country! Luckily, I let Janet take my credit cards and traveler's checks. You've both been so very kind to the children and to me. - Please, let me pay for it. - I couldn't let you do that. - I would really feel it an honor. - That's very nice. - I mean, it's so embarrassing. - It's not embarrassing at all. And if you please... ...here is just a little contribution towards the gasoline. - That's very... No, I couldn't. - Thank you so much. - Otherwise, we couldn't go on. - What's money? Yes, thank you. It's so embarrassing. He's very nice, isn't he, darling? Hello! - Good morning! - How are you? I'm fine. Good morning, sir. Where are Romeo e Julieta? Romeo and Julieta? The little boy and girl. They couldn't wait. They got up early and went sightseeing. - What are you looking for? - The Grand Canal. - The Grand Canal is in Venice. - I know. - We're in Verona. - I know we're in Verona. I left the Verona guide in Padua. - What do you want to see in Verona? - A hairdresser. Janet, you just had your hair done yesterday. Look at it. You're right. You look for a hairdresser... ...I'll go look for a good cup of coffee. Janet, look. No, don't look. Over your left shoulder, that man reading the paper. - Isn't that that girl, Loretta? - Lauren. - Lauren, yes. - Yes. What's she doing in a foreign newspaper? Well, read it. What does it say? Dove. You speak the language. What does it mean? - Bird. Peace. - It doesn't mean bird or peace. - Wrong. "Where." - What? - They want to know where she is. - She's right up here, isn't she? - I don't know. - Let's get a paper. I can't believe we've actually seen it. I mean, the real Juliet's balcony. Fantastic, huh? - Why didn't you tell me? - What? About this! You lied to me. You weren't going to Venice to see your sick mother. You were running away, both of you. And you have made me a kidnapper! I'm sorry, Julius. We'll explain everything to them. They won't listen to you. Don't you understand me? - They'll put me away. - Put you away? What for? Because I'm... I'm... I can explain. If we don't get out of here fast, we're gonna be explaining to the cops. They'll be watching the station, checking cars. You're right. Daniel! Daniel! We've got to go back. He'll never catch up. All right. Where is he? You didn't have to try to win. All we had to do was get out of town. Good idea. Let's get these off. Yes. I never did like wearing a number when I didn't have to. So... ...what kind of crook are you? Burglar? Arsonist? Embezzler? A pickpocket. English. A language totally lacking in imagination or subtlety... ...but yes, I am a pickpocket. I'm sorry, Lauren. The money to pay for dinner last night? I had to get you to Venice. How else was I to pay for the food... ...and the rooms and the bicycles? Julius. It gets worse. - That day at the races... - I don't want to hear. Well, I do. Go on. The horse you picked for the last race lost. Yes, but the horse you picked won. Thank you for thinking that, but if I could pick horses... ...I wouldn't have to pick pockets. - You stole that money. - Yes. - 20,000 francs? A good day. Your hunch wasn't better than my system. Why did you do it? Because I had to get you to Venice to see your poor, sick mother. Are any of us so blameless? What will we do now? Venice is out of the question. They know we were heading there. It will be alive with police. Well, at least we got to Verona. Almost as good as Venice. After all, Verona was good enough for Romeo and Juliet. True, it didn't turn out so good for them, but... I haven't told you something. What? I have to go back. We always knew we'd get caught sooner or later. No. I mean back to the United States... ...in two weeks. For vacation? For good. That's why I wanted to go to Venice. Not just to run away... ...but so we could kiss under the Bridge of Sighs... ...at sunset when the bells tolled... ...the way the Brownings did. And then we could love each other forever. Why didn't you tell me? Because I was afraid you'd think it was dumb, and it was. It was all a bunch of lies, wasn't it? All of it. You never lived at the Brownings' villa, did you? No. And Emilienne, she was a lie too, wasn't she? Well... There was an Emma... ...I loved very much. But she was young and couldn't wait for me to finish my term in prison. But no, there was no Emilienne. She was a fantasy. She was a lie! She was an attempt to bring... ...a little romance into my life. That's pretty sad. Any sadder than sitting in a darkened theater... ...pretending you are Robert Redford performing heroic deeds? What am I supposed to do? Shoot it out with the bad guys? No, I'd take the girl I love to Venice and kiss her under the Bridge of Sighs. Why? That legend is just another one of your damn lies. You could make it true. Legends are but stories about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Of course, it takes courage and imagination. Not everybody has that. I may be an old fraud, Daniel, but I do know this: Something that two people who are in love... ...create together against impossible odds... ...can hold them together... ...forever. Where are you going? Venice. Who else wants to come? Police are police, in Venice or Verona. I hope they don't expect us to do this in here. - Bonjour, Madame King. - Bonjour. Monsieur De Marco, Monsieur King. This is Mr. Michon, Daniel's father. Would you please come in? We have just received word that they were seen in Verona. - Are they still there? - We don't think so. There was a local athletic event they used to slip past the authorities. I could do a better job of finding these kids. You're free to try, monsieur. Perhaps you could win yourself another merit badge. Do you know what we're going through? - The thought of Lauren with a pervert... - He isn't a pervert. He has a record as a pickpocket, not a kidnapper or molester. You want to know what I think? - I think she ran away with Daniel. - Ran away? Richard... If they ran away, why is the old guy with them? I don't know. - Why would she run away? - They were spotted again. I'm flying to Venice to coordinate things. Care to go with me? Yes. Thank you. - There's a flight leaving at 12:15. - I'll meet you there. I want to come with you. Well, someone has to stay here in case she calls. - Kay, listen, it is a good idea... - George. - Yeah? - Lf you don't mind... ...I don't think we're going to need to see any more of you. - I think that's up to Kay, not you. - It's up to Kay and me. I've been standing around watching this go on between you... ...being too civilized to fight for her. If I'd told her how much I care, she wouldn't need you. - You don't have to listen. - She does. You're forgetting I've been in your shoes. I'm her third husband. I took her away from somebody myself. You came along when Kay needed excitement, but it wouldn't last. All you're interested in is seeing if you can take her from me. Well, you can't. He's been nice enough to offer us a ride. Get in. - You're being highhanded. - I'm sure you can find your way home. The basilica of San Marco was built between 1063 and 1073. The five great domes were added during the 13th century... ...and after the sack of Constantinople in 1204 by the Venetians. Byzantine artists were brought in to transform this basilica... ...into the treasure we are about to see. - Yes, ma'am? - How much did it cost? That's hard to say, but in today's terms, several hundred million dollars. Then you'd think they could get it cleaned. Well, I wouldn't know that. - Please follow me. - Notice this end is sinking? - Much more. I wonder why. - Maybe because that end is rising. How long are we staying? And here is good evidence that Venice continues to sink on its own foundation. You can see the watermarks here where the flood of 1966... ...flooded the whole floor of the basilica... ...and filled the crypt up to the ceiling. Rough seas and high tides remain a present and increasing danger... ...to the preservation of San Marco as well as all the banks. Solutions are being sought. But the experts' opinions conflict. Now, if you follow me, we shall begin the visit of the basilica... ...from this altar. It was dedicated to the Madonna and finished in 1617. Above the altar, you can admire the Madonna of Nicopeia... ...the renowned and highly venerated icon... ...which was brought here from Constantinople in 1204. There are more than 40 iconographies of the virgin in St. Mark's. She welcomes you at the threshold of St. Peter's... ...and the chapel of St. Clement. And she is repeatedly portrayed in the crusades... My God. Do you wish to confess, my daughter? Bob! - Quick. Come on. - I'm so tired. You can rest later. Come on, quickly. - I can't go any further. - Yes, you can. Come on. Gondola! Hello! Gondola. - Maybe we should... - What? Take that gondola and head to the Bridge of Sighs now. - It's too early. The legend says sunset. - What legend? Our legend. It's going to be sunset when the bells toll or not at all. Now, come on. Julius! Wait, wait. The police are there. We'll go in there. - No. Not this one. - Why not? I'd rather be captured than sit through that again. - That one. - Yes! Here. Here. Take these and take the money. But what about you? I will come back around 7, plenty of time... ...to reach your bridge by sunset. - What about you? The three of us together are easy to spot. See you later. Gentlemen, I believe you are looking for me. I am Julius Edmond Santorin. - You're going to see him. - Who? Redford. - Suppose the police come in here. - Don't worry. I'm watching for them. The blue-eyed one, that's Paul Newman? Very good. Now, again. What did you do with the children? I can't tell you that. Not yet. When, then? - What time is the sunset tonight? - Sunset? Yeah. What time? - About 7:30. - Can you hear the bells from here? Of course. Until they toll... ...I won't tell you... ...a thing. Wake up, wake up! We're late. - We'll never make it. - We'll make it. Don't worry. Wait, wait. This is the best part. - Where's Julius? - I don't know. We can't wait for him. We've gotta find a gondola. Come on. We want a gondola. - Bridge of Sighs, and step on it. - 15,000 lira in advance. - We've only got 12. - 12,000. Take it or leave it. - No. 15. - Go to hell. You go. You go. - What are you doing? - My father's a cabdriver. - I know how to deal with these bastards. - All right, come on. I take you. But I won't sing. Thank God for that. Inspector Barloni? Inspector Leclerc de la SuretÃ©. Nice to meet you. This is Mr. King, Lauren's father. Monsieur King... May I present myself? I'm Julius Edmond Santorin. Mr. Santorin. Your daughter... ...is a very lovely girl. Where is she? I'm sorry they hit you. I'd like to talk to Mr. Santorin privately, if I may. I assure you, Monsieur King... ...your daughter is safe... ...and well. - What are you doing? - There is the bridge. - You've seen it. Now get out. - You've got to take us under it. This is as far as I go for 12,000 lira. Damn it! It's just down there. I don't understand. If you assure me that she's safe and well, why can't you tell me where she is? Where is Lauren? At this moment, she is in a gondola... ...going under the Bridge of Sighs. What for? A kiss. Michelle, darling, I'll take that. You get the bag in the bedroom. Michelle, would you get my brown leather bag...? Gloves, upstairs in the bureau? - Oh, my God! - Get in the car, Kay. - Do you see who's there? - Get in the car. - Go ahead. - Thanks. Nice car. We have a lot of luggage. The furniture's going to be sent on later. This is my address. I'll write every day. Well, probably not every day. I don't want you getting sick of me. It may be a while before we see each other again. I know. By then we'll be like everybody else. We'll lose our lead. I'll come to Paris with a bunch of college friends. I don't want you to be like everybody else. I don't want to be like everybody. We are not now, and I hope we never will be. We are different... ...and I am glad. Lauren. We will be exceptionally gifted and remain true to each other. We'll remember every detail, everything that's happened since we met... ...okay? Call me Bogie. - I forgot what I said. - You said, "Why?" And I said: "Because they belong together." [ENGLISH]
