Be careful... Keep the sun off the Senator's head. Ok, doctor. Sailor, set sail for the Island of the Sun. This old man bothers me. Paco! -It's time, Paco! -I'm coming! -Paco! -I'm coming! I told you! Paco! I'm coming! I'm going out and I'll be right back, doll! Everyday it's the same thing Paco! What's up, man? All you ever do is nag! You're supposed to be working! Working? That's where I work. That's my home and I demand peace and quiet. I can't concentrate. The clowns have been on 3 times. -How was there? -Nothing bad. She's beautiful and only 16 years old. And you brings an underage girl to my circus? I don't want trouble, understand me? And you, kid? Cut your hair. You look like a fag! What a lovely name! Mink stoles YEAR LATER A chauffeur-driven Cadillac Trips to Paris I urgently need A sugar-daddy To enrich my life To enrich my life To enrich my life Excuse me. I'm the driver of Congressman Jo?o Gaspar. He would like to have a word with you. Could you accompany me? He's the grey-haired man. In this car. Follow me, please. You were beautiful in the show. Shall we go out? Let's! To the Copacabana Palace Hotel. It was a delightful evening. But she put her foot in it. She ended up under arrest. To make things worse... She met Agildo and Indalecio on the same night. Take your hands off me! Let me go! Get off! Tell these pieces of shit to let me go! -Stop with this scene! -Shit! I can't see you right now, Ma'am. Out, out, out! You sons of a bitch! Please, calm down! Hey! A photograph! Dress in here. -Get the camera from that guy! -He's a hunk! Put that away! Are you crazy? Sabar?, go find an empty cell. We're jam-packed. So go and empty one as much as you can. OK? Could I go in and talk to her? You want to talk to her? Haven't you... and that other clown caused enough trouble already? -Me, Chief?. -No, no! Sabar?, get that bimbo's clothes. She was already like that when we arrested her. -Naked? -Stark naked. -Hey, wait a minute! -It's just a loan. Take it all, Chief. Everything's always urgent with you. This year it was the electoral campaign. Last year it was the party Convention, or whatever. Never any time left over for your family. You're the only one I know that has time left for work! Work ennobles a man. Most people lead a normal life. Work is work. And family is family. Many put family first. Could you ask your daughter to stop playing drums... -at least during dinner? -My daughter! Yes, my daughter, 'cause you don't have time to her... even to ask something to her personally. -What is it, Alzira? -The telephone, sir. I told you no one answers the phone during dinner. But the girl said it was important. So I wasn't sure. -What girl? -I didn't catch the name. Something like "fuego"... Oh, Luz del Fuego. One of his canvassers. -That's right. -I'll get it in the office. That's all I needed! Now we'll have to put up with sluts calling all the time! Wait a moment, the Chief's here, talk to him. He'll explain everything. I'm talking to a Congressman friend of mine. Except he can't understand. Talk to him. Hello, Congressman. Whatever are you thinking? This is no rendez-vous! This is a family residence! Play-time's over, sweetheart! Put this on. But Chief... Put this on or I'll sling you in jail. I'd put it on if I were you. Take your hands off me! Get out'a here! Out! Go, go, go fuck Deodoro, you fag! Hey, guys! Fresh meat! Are you here on business... or just passing through? I'm the Alligator. From the Peacock Shanty. Up there, all the girls are crazy for me. -Open up, fuck it! Open up! -Leave the girl alone. Let's just see that nice furry pussy! Open up! You think you're a virgin? Open your legs, will you! Leave the girl alone, will you! What's up, doll? What's up, doll? What's up what, you bastard? Right, you son of a bitch! Come and get me! You watch out with me! You watch out! Or you'll be an alligator-skin bag! So, no son of a bitch can face up to the doll, eh? Sit down, girl. He's the Alligator, but I'm Agildo. It's gonna be outrageous! I'll drive the newspaper editor crazy! Just look at the headline! "Congressman Jo?o Gaspar... releases naked woman". No! It's not good. l have a better idea! "Congressman Jo?o Gaspar Condones Nudity". What a headline! Are you still thinking about that? Forget it! It can't be forgotten, Luz. It's a scoop! My chance to go up in the newspaper. Easy, Indalecio! l can make you talk to him. He's a big fish. He can get you something bigger. Maybe even on another newspaper. Ok. I'll see him, but about other things. That article is right. This is my chance... Virginia, honey! My love! You came just at the right time. Come here! See that monster in front of you? He's very, very bad. He's going to hurt Gaspar. But we won't let him, will we? Why don't you wrap around him... and gobble him all up? Stop it, Luz! Look at him! He's better than that calf you ate in Mato Grosso. Don't do this to me! I'm terrified of snakes! Give me my coat back. Let me go, please! This is blackmail, Luz! Stop it! Here you are, you coward! Don't be silly, Trancoso. I trust your opinion. Have you forgotten it was I who backed your election... for your position in the House? So, you'd rather trust my good sense. No need to repeat it again. I only interceded... for the girl out of political motive. The election campaign is in full swing. We need to widen horizons and I have no doubt... that the arts can provide a very important back-up. Yes, I had to. Who did you expect me to go to? The Warden of the Zoo? To release someone in jail... I had to go to the Chief of Police. Of course. That's your opinion. For me, starlet is an artist. Look, we'll talk about... all right... we'll talk about it personally this afternoon. She needs a stage. I don't know. I'm doing what the boss ordered. The snake alone is bigger than the room. I don't know about that. The snake will have to go. You don't understand. The snake is the big attraction. Talk to the Boss. There he is! What's all this about, then? Celestino? I talked to you on the phone yesterday. The girl with the snake is here. Right? She's been here for hours! The snake's getting nervous. This cubicle's impossible, Celestino. So let's leave it for another day. The theatre is full. Oh no, man. It took me days to convince her... and she's been rehearsing for days. She comes here and you say it's not on? Let's be honest. I'm getting out of this business. Revue theatre has had it. And you tell me it just now! How could I tell you before... if this is the first time I've set eyes on you? I'm fucked up. What do I tell her? That's your problem. Tell her what I told you. Say I'm going out of business. Tell her I'm renting this shit to a restaurant. For a dance hall, a brothel, anything. All I want is to make enough money... to stay home and scratch my balls. That's enough talk! Here! You want to sell, right? -Rent. -So. Rent or buy... whatever! Let's go. If I say so, you can believe it. Nice? Nice? He would be if he didn't publish that article... without anything in exchange! How did you convince Indalecio? Just talking. He was tired of covering petty crime. He wanted to go up in life. And talking... I heard about you going to that theatre. I just mixed pleasure with business. He's so excited. Now it's just the script and cast. You'll soon see! And how are you? Can you doubt it? To be honest, I was tired of seeing you... in those third-rate joints earning a pittance. That's why I bought... rented that theatre. And I got myself out of that report. Champagne? Yes. This stuff is going to my head! Forget it! The Manager has already asked you... not to stand naked in front of the window. Soon we'll get out of here and be more comfortable. Watch out for the Manager! It was a complete success! The audience loved it! -Did you take a bow? -3 times, Indalecio! 3 times! Good! I never thought a snake could perform so well! She deserves a prize! Double rations to Virginia! 2 excellent releases for film-goers. Alfred Hitchcock, the Master of suspense... brings us "Dial M for Murder"... with Ray Milland and Grace Kelly. And "The Quiet Man" by John Ford... with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. And a tornado is sweeping the nights of Rio... with the play starring Luz del Fuego who dances... wrapped in snakes! Luz del Fuego, a madwoman, an exhibitionist... a revolutionary, or an actress? To answer our questions, here are our guests... Chief of Police Deodoro Dias... one of our police's most stalwart men. Fr. Delgado, theology doctor... and professor at the University of Brazil. Iara Satan, the queen of the Brazilian wiggle. Miss Maria Julia Parente... Vice-president of the Animal's Friends League. So Fr. Delgado, will all nudity be punished? Nudity in itself is a punishment. It's in Genesis. Nudity is a recognition of punishment. Adam and Eve, when expelled from Paradise... realised they were naked... and covered themselves in shame. How about you, Chief?. Legally, nudity is classed as indecent exposure... and is punishable by law. Would this be the case with Luz del Fuego? Not when restricted to private clubs, no. As long as it has been duly approved by the authorities. And does Luz del Fuego pose any threat to Iara Satan? I am the Starlet of Brazil! I have a firm career! I worked my way up. No upstart can threaten me. We are looking into it. But in principle... we are against animals being used in shows. Quite right too! Can you imagine that big snake under all those lights? It's an oven! And a snake is a creature of water! What a great idea! What? Nothing... It's nothing. -Agildo! -Agildo! Come here. Who's the name of the boy who's singing? Daisy? A boy? You're going crazy, Indalecio. I must talk to him. Ask him to come over here. -I'll do that. -So do it! What position does the Church intend to take? Our pastoral mission is to guide our flock. So, we will excommunicate anyone who watches... such spectacles. Quite right too! In the same way, we condemn your shows too. Are you comparing me to her? No. We consider both shows to be equally bad. That's absurd. She can't even sing! Father, art is one thing. Burlesque is another. Burlesque or not, the Church does not see it that way. Either sin exists, or it doesn't. Religion does not consider the degree of the sin. -Either it is, or it isn't. -That's just stupid! Iara... The Catholic Church does not distinguish between... large and small. It merely identifies the sin. No way. I'm out of here! That will in no way modify the Church's stance. Shut up! Go preach to your choir-boys! Cut! Cut! Things have got out of hand! Let sleeping dogs lie. At least, in politics. It must be the same in your field of work. Isn't the place packed out every night? Why fret? And give up such an idea? Drama needs change, Gaspar. Soon the snake and me will no longer be a novelty. We must always have something up our sleeves. I think it's risky. You're already in the public eye. This idea of transvestites. I don't know... Paris has had them for ages! What's the big deal? You forget censorship. Your first show was hard enough! But you got it through! If you want, you can. All you have to do is want to. Maybe. Or at least, I hope so! THE WORLD IS FOR THE DOLLS Take it easy, Chief. Relax! It's no big deal. It must be awful to work like this. You have to get bad-tempered when you arrest someone? Imagine if everyone had to get bad-tempered at work! Imagine if I went on stage fuming with rage! Ademir cursing each time they scored against his team. Or Angela Maria blowing raspberries at her audience. Enjoy the ride, Deodoro! -Anything else, boss? -No. You can go. Not even an apple? What apple?! Just go! Shit! A blanket? That's sure to tickle! Couldn't you get an eiderdown? Know why? I can only sleep naked, you see. I think this blanket is going to itch. Well... Let's try. -What's up? -The deal's closed. The place has been bought. Now Madame Luz del Fuego... is the owner of a house with a view of the Atlantic Ocean. The Boss has lots of money. Giving a place like that... He's quite right. What's he going to do with the money? Give it to his tight-assed wife? That's no wife! That's a viper! Come on. Let's go! If you see a pay-phone, pull up. -He's expecting my call. -Ok. Silence. Silence, please! Our dear Luz del Fuego would like to say a few words. I'd like to introduce to our dear audience... our dear producer and director... Indalecio Ribeiro! I am here... the whole team is... delighted... that today, we have done the 100th performance... of a unique show in Brazil. Thanks to Luz del Fuego... we have proved that the stage is for all... no matter what sex, ideology or religion. We have brought the third sex out the shadows... And now we can all see... the talent of these wonderful boys. Finally, a special thanks... to Congressman Gaspar, a future senator in Brazil. Look! Look in that mirror! A defeated man! The mere shadow of a senator! A man who had everything... and lost everything for a 4th-class whore! To vote for Gaspar is to vote for debauchery. In the name of decency... in the name of the morality of the Brazilian family... Jo?o Gaspar should be banned... from the national political scene! The fury of my enemies has fallen upon my head. Just in the moment that the nation, in my name... is on the way to power. The voice of prejudice and false moralism... rises to uncover mortal sin where there is no evil! But these voices do not deter me. Except for those undecided and easily led. But the man in the street, never! Because he is not so easily deceived. He knows well what a kiss means. He knows the affection of a kiss its recognition... and its expression of tenderness. Friends, ladies... young people, you know what a kiss means. The answer lies with you. Show in the polling-booth... those unbelievers who only see behind a kiss... the figure of Judas. Mink stoles A chauffeur-driven Cadillac Vacations in... Luz del Fuego. Together, we'll conquer the world! A fucking kiss got me into the Senate! Now we'll screw in the Place de la Concorde! Fireworks, Indalecio! Fireworks! Let's go, Agildo! Mink stoles Chauffeur-driven Cadillacs Vacations in Paris! After win these elections, Ladies and Gentlemen... this Senator is going to give... a fireworks display! All nudity... Yes, senator? Damn it. All nudity will be rewarded! The denial of the body is the denial of freedom! Nudism is not subversion! Nudity was never anarchy! The naked body is free. Is beautiful, mobile and healthy. Man needs nudity like he needs water. The nation needs nudity as it needs beans. The nation of Brazil! everyone... Nude! Everyone strip! Everyone nude! Now let's see if that thing l promised you works. -Turn off the lights! -Let's see, let's see! It's just like a snake Senator! A little clumsy. Hi, Dad! Dad? Where did you get that from, boy? Wasn't it you who last night forbade everyone... to use the word "Senator"? You said it yourself. To call you Dad, not Senator... Forget yesterday. Today is today. Ok. Great Dad! I don't know what strange Spell you have woven That drives me so crazy Dad... Dad... -Dad... -Ok... Dad! Excuse me... You can forget this deal, Aquino. I've already paid a deposit. I don't care. Work it out. I won't set foot in that slut's house. I won't bring up our children there! But I can't back out now. I'll lose the deposit. How could I know it belonged to Luz de Fuego? The deeds show a totally different name. Just one moment more. The notary and owner... will be here any moment. Congratulations, Ma'am. You made an excellent purchase. But you were not entirely honest. In what way? Isn't the price to your liking? But you should have told us who it belonged to. I've already told my husband. Neither I nor my children will ever set foot there! I want that house by the lagoon. So you change clothes in front of the windows... with everyone watching! I've seen that film! Mister Aquino, Miss Luz, the owner. May all those who are now present before me know... that I, in bona fide, in the year of our Lord, 1959... site as purchaser, Mr. Jos? de Aquino... How marvellous! Funny how different people can be. I simply adore this place and you loathe it. You know you upset me, Luz. You're just a little girl. Never satisfied with what has... always wanting something else. I'm a spoilt little girl and you're a dictator. I defied you by selling the house. But I don't care. I don't care what you think of the island. You would think it was shit anyway. When your Royal Highness gave me that house... you never thought I'd dare sell it, did you? Imagine, exchange that house for this thing. Here, there isn't even a place to sit down! Just looks at my trousers! It's rocks, sand, thorn bushes... Just getting here nearly gave me a heart attack! And I have something else to tell you. On this island, my life is going to change. I'll only appear on stage once in a blue moon. And then, only to publicize the island. More bullshit! I told you to let sleeping dogs lie. I've proved to you that it's good to make charges. It helps. It's for the better. You just wait. You'll see what I have planned for this island. Hey! Why haven't you taken off your clothes? Ah, it's Pericles... He took me by surprise, Luz. He just turned up... -Who is the son of a bitch? -My secretary. I'm sorry, sir. I have urgent business for you. Get your clothes off, sonny boy! Is that how you guard the way-in, Agildo? With people coming and going we gonna have a red light! And take off those ridiculous panties! Let's go inside, Pericles. I won't be long. I'll be back to finish those invitations. Goddamn these rocks! You'll have to learn to go barefoot on the island, sir. I'll have the whole place concreted over! Come on, Pericles! Stop with that shit, Agildo! Damn it! Stop whoring around! What an asshole! We've been here for ages and nothing happens. Time goes by and nothing happens. And you're a great help, aren't you, son of a bitch? Ok, Ok... -Come here, Agildo! -Let's go. Statutes of the Brazilian Nudist Club. Pay attention, Agildo. Any suggestion is welcome. The opening party is been decided. Right? Any doubts? No. Remember how drunk Gaspar got... on Senate election day? What he yelled out? That's been going round in my head. I've had an idea. But he mustn't know. I'm going to write a speech for you to give at party. It's going to be really bombastic! Silence, please! Quiet! Our Luz will speak! We do not want the Island of the Sun to be seen... merely as a place where nudism is practiced. It's time to think big. The Naturalist Movement... must claim its place on the political arena. Ladies and Gentlemen, we are today founding... the Brazilian Naturalist Party, which already has... the support of its true founder... Senator Jo?o Gaspar who, in a moment of inspiration... created the phrase that will henceforth be our motto... and our war-cry... "People of Brazil! Everyone nude!" Everyone nude! I called you because I need some help. This affair has gone too far and I confess I am unable... to convince Gaspar of the gravity of the situation. Isn't it madness for Gaspar to lead a Party... of fanatical nudists? That's not quite the point. I no longer care about his affair with that slut. I think it would be better if we talked privately. No, otherwise she'll go in there and start... playing the drums and we won't hear ourselves think. As you wish. But don't worry about it. It's all a misunderstanding. What if he loses his post? What will he do? He always been a politician, the only thing he knows. Your husband is a very clever man, he'll find a way out. I hope so! Even if he hasn't worked as a husband for many years... at least I hope he can support us! I'm the new owner of this island! I'm out here! Don't run away! I'm not kicking you out. What a strange guy! No. People round here are like that, reserved. We could hire him. What do you think? Instead of buying a boat, we could hire one. Boats cost a small fortune these days. You go that way, Agildo, and I'll go this way. Go! Good morning! Weren't you on the Island of the Sun? Hello! Is this your child? This one's hers. Mine are at home. Are you sisters? She's the eldest. -And who's his lucky lady? -She is. I'm his wife. I see... -Do you want some fish? -No. I just needed to talk to your husband. I need to hire a boat. Garden of tenderness Love-birds and doves Fishermen's humble homes And the moon shines High above As on Paquet? we make love Mysterious rendez-vous in Paquet?. Sit down. I need to have a serious talk with you. And I need to have a serious talk with you. Why didn't you come to my party? You knew how much it meant to me. Are you crazy? Don't you understand I'm a senator now? But a Congressman can go to the theatre, right? Actually, I helped you a lot in the elections. Times have changed... And I can't let you jeopardise me like you used. What idea is this about involving me... in a nudist Party? Are you mad, or want to ruin me? It was in all the papers! And I look like a total idiot! I think you should be proud of yourself. Is that what you think? Forget the whole thing... and keep me out of any Party, understand? Luz, times are changing and things could get heavy. A lot of things in Brazil may be changing. Keep out of this Party. Take my word for it. I always wanted the best for you. The Constitution guarantees legally recognized... party meetings. This party does not exist. Anyway, a meeting is one thing. Rallies are another. Isn't that just your personal opinion, sir? Authorities do not have opinions. Authorities make decisions and this is mine. Nobody actually knows what this demonstration is about. What kind of rally is likely to be forbidden? I shall be there and I'll decide by the facts. Doesn't the City have more serious affairs... to deal with first? Your paper decides the front page. Here who decides the priorities is me. Going back to another question... when the Constitution refers to a meeting... does this meeting have to be behind closed doors? What are you driving at? Excuse me, "sir", but who is interviewing who? Look, kids! It won't be two journalists... who'll come in here questioning my authority! You press people are funny. You couldn't see a scoop... if it bit you on the ass! The whole thing's absurd. Luz del Fuego founding a political party is mad! And you know that very well. I'll deal with this case... personally tomorrow. No high jinks with me! You can bet on that! This interview is over! People of Brazil, vote for the Brazilian Naturalist Party! Listen up! Man is only free in contact with nature. Mankind needs to go naked just as needs water. Hear our motto, "Everyone nude"! Say it along with me! All together now! Everyone nude! Everyone nude! She's gone completely bonkers! As if the rally wasn't enough she had to do it... all over again at my front door! -People of Rio! -Right! -Our time has come! -I don't believe it! ...greets the Nation and demands to be heard! -I know. -Our Senator, Jo?o Gaspar... But Vicente! They're making a scene outside my door! Where's Deodoro? See if you can find him. Right. Now Jo?o Gaspar is putting his foot down! ...to free our bodies and our minds. Stop those drums or I'll smash them to pieces! Go ahead! Smash them! Join your own crowd! As our Senator said... Everyone nude! Everyone nude! You want to make an enemy out of me? Not me, "Mr." Senator! For starters, only peasants say "Mr." Senator. A journalist says "Yes Senator" or "No Senator". The smarter ones say "Yes Senator". Learn it. Or don't you want to become a real journalist? Of course you do. So learn this too... recent events cannot be repeated... with your participation or we'll all get ruined. If she insists on continuing and won't realise that Brazil... has changed, then she's screwed. But she'll get screwed alone, without me, without you. You're a journalist, not a gigolo. It's time to start over from wherever we can... making concessions, friends, allies... and a little money. This is a chance to restart as my middleman. And your first concession. I had to take drastic measures. I told Deodoro to arrest her. But she's smart and managed to blackmail poor Deodoro. I'm a dead man. Fucked, ruined! So many years of struggle and sacrifice for nothing! She was prepared. She'd prepared everything... to blackmail me! Ten years after it's all there in Luz del Fuego's diary. It could ruin my career! No! Easy! Look, all that happened 1 0 years ago. You think she's records every screw she ever had? She's screwed the whole world! Use your head! I'm not guessing, Heleno. She proposed a deal. I get her off the hook and she won't compromise me. In that case, you'll have to go along with the deal. I won't make any deal. I won't! Easy! Think it over. You have a good job. Soon you'll retire and everything will calm down. Look at me! I'm there on my country estate... doing fuck all! Nice and quiet. Think of the future. Don't you think I've ever had to pull my pants down? Ok. I'll sleep on it. You do that! Son of a voodoo bitch! What are you up to? Come here! Come here! Suck me! Let's see who's the best witch bitch! My soul... If this is love... I think I'm happy. Luz told us to deal with the diary affair. You two, not. Only the Senator. You wait there. You know the rules, Senator. Here, not even the Pope wears clothes! C'mon Senator. Ass out! Otherwise, no diary! Sorry! I didn't know... Sorry! How could I know you were screwing in the living-room? -Ah, so that's it! -You know what? I'm going to see people I know. Suddenly, the whole place's got weird. Became full of forbidden places. Put a sign on the door, will you? What do you want? That I go round in circles... so I don't interrupt your screws with that witch? Yes. That's exactly what I want, Agildo. Sailor, stop this thing right there. Sailor! I'm sure... I'm the only one she ever gave herself to. Get going, Sailor! Ivonete, what's this guy doing here? He had a bad turn. He's resting. I mean, what is he doing in my chair? He was looking for you. Luz del Fuego gone missing. l think she's dead. She's disappeared, Chief. Over a week ago. It was that voodoo witch! It was him! Canario! He beat her up. She didn't recognise anyone. She put everything in her diary. Sabar?, get him out of here. Put him in solitary. I'm the only one who can talk to him. Take him away! -Come on, let's go. -Get your hands off me. I don't know anything. What are you investigating? Her death, or her diary? How can you keep him in solitary without a charge? Especially a respected journalist like Indalecio? You'll be slaughtered on the front page! It's a curse! Anything to do with Luz del Fuego falls on my head! Use your head! You have a body? No. No body, no crime. And you're all outdoing each other... to catch a murderer. It must be because of the diary. What if it's one of Luz's publicity stunts? You'll look a right idiot! What's happened? Where's "the man with cold eyes"? The Henry Fonda of the Rio Police dept.? You look just like a nervous rookie! Easy for you to say! Put yourself in my shoes. My client has had no contact with Luz del Fuego for ages. Police Chief Deodoro Dias must have some secret... to treat my client in such a gross manner. Write this: I place Chief Dias under suspicion. -Shall I heat up the coffee? -No need. Pass me the sugar. How's school, then? What's got into this kid? Ivonete! Ivonete! Sit down... May I know what's going on under my own roof?. I talk to her and she doesn't answer. And you with that hurt look. Do you think this is pleasant for Mariana? It isn't easy for me either. I'm furious... Ivonete, will you please tell me what's going on? Just spit out, will you! An adolescent's father is a murder suspect! -How's that again? -Read the paper... -What's in the paper? -Just read it! The bastard son of a...! Hello? Who is it? Look, I want everybody... who's working on the case of this slut Luz del Fuego... here within half an hour! Is that clear? On the dot! Who's talkin' here? This is the Brazilian Bombshell speaking, darling! Mink stoles A chauffer-driven Cadillac Trips to Paris I urgently need A sugar-daddy To enrich my life To enrich my life To enrich my life This diary's incomplete. Several pages are missing. I'm sure that it will soon be even more incomplete. -What are you driving at? -Our Chief of Police. I don't believe that you'll reveal a document with such... intimate details! I think I can be honest with you. We're both victims of Luz's indiscretions. The pages in which I figured in that diary are ashes. I presume you will take similar measures. Our positions do not allow us to be thus compromised. Leave it to me, Senator. I will deal with this. One more thing. Sooner or later, Luz will appear. It would then be a tragedy if certain persons... were in any way involved in this. I suggest that you find the most logical perpetrator. Most suited to the situation or the most practical. I shall keep that in mind. -Who'll identify the body? -Put it right there. Take it away. He who lives dangerously risks a tragic death. Does Luz del Fuego belong to posterity? Of course not, my daughter. Posterity only records great names and great works. Look, I have been a politician for 30 years. Dedicated to great national works. This is what history will record. The work of someone who worked for the people. On the other hand, doesn't work for... women's liberation also deserve merit? Maybe, of a minority. The Brazilian woman is recognised as a mother... and the mother cell of society. It is within the family, that women find liberation. Senator, it seems that you had... a torrid love affair with Luz del Fuego. No comment. It also seems that you were a sponsor for Luz del Fuego. No comment. There is a list of her possible murderers... or those who ordered it. Your adviser, journalist Indalecio Ribeiro... Chief of Police Deodoro Dias and Luz's recent friends... Agildo and the fisherman Canario. Even your name has been mentioned. My dear, there is a long list of the services... I have lent to my country and the Brazilian nation. A man of untainted reputation. I shall answer duly at the due time in the due place. And anyone who soils my name shall also answer in court. Thank you, Senator. Be careful what you publish. Why don't you do something more useful? Luz del fuego... That's no way to a decent career in journalism. Sorry, Senator. This has to go out tomorrow. What a democrat has to go through! We'll only refer to Canario from now on. He's our key. Be careful. He could be dangerous. A suspect of several murders out in the suburbs. The subversive leader of a community center. A self-confessed bigamist. Married to two sisters. Children by both. A voodoo practitioner of the worst kind. Knew Luz intimately. Knew the whole routine on the Island of the Sun. Sabar?! Lourival! Cure his hangover! And get rid of rim! Get rid of him, sir? It's not what you think. Get him out of here! But, Chief! This guy... This guy, this guy! This guy's one of Luz's. He's only made trouble for years. He gets drunk and goes berserk. Imagine if this catches on? Everday, we'll have people from the Island... saying they're the murderer. And this goes for you too! For everyone! The case has been solved. Canario's our man. Canario! Got it! Canario! And don't show up with anybody except him! I'll denounce them all! Gaspar, Deodoro, Agildo... Canario... all assholes! All murderers! Even me! The sun must shine one more time. Light, Luz, must reach into our hearts. Love... must be once again eternal. It's Judgment Day... the story of good and evil. I wish to have eyes to see all evil fade. It's her! It's Luz! Look! She'll never die! She's back! She always comes back! Did you see? I am a Light that never goes out. Subtitulos: Pichulas2009
