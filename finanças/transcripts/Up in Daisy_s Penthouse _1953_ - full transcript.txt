Well, I got the marriage license and the wedding's all set for 3:00. Nice work, cutie. Me and Chopper decided to have the wedding up here in the penthouse. Yeah, it wouldn't be very polite to give a guy the works in his own joint. Especially on his wedding day. It's all right by me. Attagirl. And after it's all over, you and I are going to Europe and spend the old guy's dough, huh, baby? [BOTH CHUCKLE] Come on, give a guy a chance. Don't hog the mirror. Oh. There. Oh, oh.

CHOPPER: Sure. As soon as the mug marries Daisy, I'll polish him off. BUTCH: We can't shoot him. That'll make too much noise. Sure, it'll make noise. I got it. Soon as they get married, I'll take the groom, dump him out of the window, he drops 14 stories, then it looks like an accident. BUTCH: Yeah, that's a good idea. Whew. I'm glad they made up their mind, because if... Wait a minute. Do you think they mean me? Well, they don't mean your uncle. Whoa. Well, Popsie, are you ready for the big leap? Big leap? Yes, I...

I wonder what's keeping my Daisy-waisy? Boy, will she be surprised to see how young I look. [RINGS] Hello. Is Daisy there? Yeah, but she can't come to the phone now, she's busy getting married to Howard. Thanks, I'll call later. Married? She can't do that. I ain't there. But I'll be there. I'm coming right over, that's what I'll do. By golly. How do you like that? Look at this. Snap dragons, eh? I'll fix her. I'll tell her a thing or two. Why that... By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife 'till death do you part. [SQUEALS] [SHEMP SQUEALING] You know, we can't throw the old man out the window while the Justice of the Peace is still here. What am I going to do? I got it. Let's dump him down the elevator shaft. Good boy. Now I'll tell you what you do. Yeah? You go in and tell him... You can't marry without me, Daisy-waisy. Uh, where... Oh, here it is here. Farino frappe. Made it up out of my own head. This drink'll put sparks in your hair. Oh, boy. I had six of these one day, mm-hm. Somebody's coming. Oh, yeah. You know, it's a nice day. Especially for the wedding upstairs here. Oh, hiya, boys.

What do you think, I'm a squirrel? No, your ears are too short. LARRY: Come on, get up, will you? Get up higher. Higher, Shemp. I can't. I've run out of pole. They're all set up for us. Well, let's give it to all of them. LARRY: Hurry it up. MOE: Get up there, faster. [ALL YELL] LARRY: Whoa. Moe, Moe. Hey, look. Ah! That's it, Butch. Hey, spread out, you guys. You're crowding me. So long, chumps. [STOOGES SCREAMING] Sufferin' cats, it's Pa. Good. Let's get him home to Ma. Am I mortified. Come on home, Pa. We know you. [♪♪♪]
