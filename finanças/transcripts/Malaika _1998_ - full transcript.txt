[animated music] [trumpeting] [growls] [suspenseful music] [speaks foreign language] [laughing] [hisses] [trumpeting] [trumpeting] [melodic music] [clicks] Mother and child. They're close. Easy. Yeah. -[laughs] -I need to get her. You'll be back home very happy. Hmm. [chuckles] No crazy, no tough. Let's go. [mellow music] [trumpeting] [brooding music] [moaning] [thrilling music] -[speaking foreign language] -[moaning] Screaming. [groans] [squeaking] [groaning] -[gunshot] -[moans] [trumpeting] [squeaks] [trumpeting] [moaning] [trumpeting] [groans] [Jack] Keep that rope tight. [trumpeting] [moaning] [brooding music] [squeaking] [moaning] Get the truck. [moaning] [suspenseful music] Out here in the open? Isn't that dangerous? I've been doing this a long time, boy. She arrived just a few hours ago, straight from the Serengeti. We will hunt tonight? Shouldn't she rest for a few days? No, it's too risky. I'll say when we hunt. Where is the money? [trumpeting] That's half of it. Where is the rest? You will have it when we get back. After the shoot? You don't trust me. Let's just say I don't wanna tempt you. Something could go wrong in an accident. I'm not stupid. [elephant moans] Deal? [trumpeting] Deal. [groans] Oh! Hey! Hey. -[sighs] -[chuckles] [lively music] [Hanna] I'd like to present the new advertising campaign for super vacuums. As you can see, Mr. Beany what we have here is the typical housewife, hardworking and industrious. Armed with the broom, she attacks the carpet A huge cloud of dust rises and suddenly, out of the dust storm this white knight gallops up and rescues her from her horrible fate. And they live happily ever after. Of course, the knight would be her husband. What do you think? Well, I like it... but I don't think the knight should be her husband. Why? Well, because like you, not all women have husbands. Honey, please get your brothers in, is bath time. No! Please, Kelly, you know how important this is. I gotta get this done by tomorrow morning. I know, we need the money. [trumpeting] [suspenseful music] [groaning] [moaning] [trumpeting] [grunts] -[thud] -[moans] Hey! [moans] [thrilling music] -[thump] -[groans] [groans] -[gunshot] -[moans] I can't move! -[thud] -[grunts] I'd like to shoot you myself, but you're not worth a bullet. [whines] Come on, David, there's school tomorrow. [David] I'm quitting school. They all make fun of my long hair. [Hanna] T-Rex. [David] My hair isn't any longer than Daddy's hair was. That was Africa, David. Daddy was a grown up. Besides, you can't quit school. It's the law. [moans] Why are these things so low? [trumpets] [melodic music] [sighs] [flute playing] [trumpeting] -Hi, mama. -Oh, hi baby. [chuckles] What are you doing up? What's with Dad's watch? Oh, I don't know. It's for luck. For tomorrow. You don't need luck. You have talent, mama. [giggles] I love you, baby. I love you too. But what you need is rest. Tomorrow you are gonna have bags under your eyes -[moans] -So, let's go. Yes, mommy. [Kelly] Come on. [moans] Could I sleep here with you? [Hanna] Oh, let me see. I didn't wet. [birds chirping] [lively music] [dogs barking] [dogs continue barking] -[trumpeting] -[barking] [whimpering] [trumpets] -[intriguing music] -What happened to him? He got run over by an elephant. You haven't mentioned our little plan to anyone, have you? Not yet. I want out. Out? You know? You're legally responsible for all of this. You're about two steps away from the pen? You're the one who wanted to kill an elephant. Remember? There is no out. If anyone hears about this hunt, I'll cut you like a fish. I'll find that elephant and we'll finish the hunt. I want my money. [lively music] -[trumpets] -[thud] [trumpets] [trumpets] [whines] It is prickly in here. I'm thirsty. [shushes] -I'm thirsty. -[shushes] -[whispers] Don't wake the others. [sings] I am thirsty. [clapping] [shushes] Is that the sun already? You should be sleeping. We should all be sleeping. Let's get you a drink of water. [water running] Here you go, sweetie. Mom, I'm hungry. [moans] Breakfast later, Daniel. Let's go back to sleep for a little while, okay? [Daniel] You don't love me. Okay, just don't-- Just don't wake the others, okay? Alright, come on. I'm gonna get you some cereal. I don't want cereal, I want mommy's pancakes. Cereal. Okay! Fine. Go get an apple. The pancakes will take a while. Specially, this early in the morning. -[playful music] -[moans] Mom, there's an elephant in the driveway. [Hanna] Honey, that's a horse. Elephants only live in Africa. We're in California now. Hi! Do you want an apple? [sniffs] [slurps] Mommy thinks you are a horse. You're really an elephant, aren't you? Wait here. Sit. [moans] [mellow music] Kelly! There's an elephant in the driveway. Leave me alone, I'm sleeping! Kelly, I promise. Hope to die, stick a needle in my eye. Really? Really! Okay, alright. Wait for me! [lively music] [moans] She's an African Grey? Wow! Radical. She is enormous! [Kelly] It's like being back in Africa. This is gonna be great! Our own elephant. She's is all wrinkly. [Matt] This is too dangerous. Mommy will never let us keep her. We're not gonna tell her, are we? Don't be stupid, she will know. Be careful, Daniel. [camera clicks] How did she get here? She flew, just like an angel. She is not Dumbo, Kelly? -[trumpets softly] -[camera clicks] Kelly? It's not a hunker? It's a trunk. Yak! [indistinct] She's hurt! Looks like someone tried to shoot her. We have to hide her in the backyard. You guys are crazy. You tell and you are dead meat. We will protect you. [camera clicking] We're gonna have to move her before mom sees her. [David] How do we do that? [Daniel] Just call her. She will come. [David] Call her what? Sally? Zeus. That's tough. She's a girl. -[trumpeting] -How do you know? Oh, Matt! Look! [Matt] How about Gina? [moans] [Kelly] She hates that. Let's call her Malaika. Remember, David? It means angel in Swahili. And how about, Mary? Yak! Come on, Malaika. Malaika! Come on, sport. Malaika. Good girl. Sally, come here, girl. Matt! Get the first aid kit. And watch out for mom. Come on, Malaika. [trumpets] [people chattering] Oh! Fat ugly gorilla. Hey! Fat ugly gorilla. -What's your name? -It's Gabriel. I'm Nick. -Hi. -Hi. You know what I do? -No. -I'm a veterinarian for the zoo. You know what a veterinarian does? -No. -Well, when animals get sick I try to make them better. I'm sorry, Mr. Gorilla. You need to be kind to animals. Just like they are to us. [people chattering and laughing] -[suspenseful music] -So, you lost an elephant? Hard to. An African Grey. I thought she may turn up at this little zoo of yours Is she tagged? I didn't notice. Ugh! And I... What did you plan to do with an African Grey here in Los Angeles? A friend of mine is in the hospital. He has a special affection for elephants. [chuckles] So, let me get this straight, Jake, or I mean, Jack. You're gonna-- your plan is to take a 7 to a 10 thousand pound animal, to a sick friend of yours in the hospital? That must be a mighty big hospital. What sort of gun does your friend Kelly? Are you trying to tell me something? No, I'm telling you to your face. You have a reputation Mr. Grant. If I find that elephant you can be absolutely certain you will never see her again. That elephant is my legal property to do with her as I please. Not to hunt. Not to kill. Not in this country. If you find that elephant, I'll expect you to return her to me. So Nick, what do you think? What do I think? Ah... he qualifies to be a definite jerk. Why can't guys like that accidentally fall into the tiger's den? You know? A little slip, may be a push... [both chuckle] [lively music] [Kelly] Hey, Matt. [Matt] Oh, it's gonna hurt. Hurry! [Daniel] Oh, not the ouchy stuff. I know what I'm doing. [moans] [trumpets softly] Come on. -[moans] -Easy, Malaika. [shushes] Daniel! Pancakes are ready. [moaning] Pancakes! Perfect! You guys, come on! Okay. Alright, come on, Danny. Okay, here is the plan. Okay. -Hi honey. -Hi, mom. Daniel. Thanks. So much for being quiet. We're starving. Well, there's one for each of you and there's more coming out. Hmm, yummy! Can we have some more? Coming, slow down, you guys. [laughing] [moans] You can't all be having [indistinct] at the same time. Can you? [laughing] There you go. That's it, that's all I'm making. [giggling] -[moans] -[Kelly shrieks] Thanks, mom! Come on, mommy. You lay down a little bit. You sleep. We're gonna go outside and play. Okay? Thanks, sweetie. We'll wake you up before school. -[lively music] -[moaning] [camera clicks] She eats like a horse. Open the mouth. How are we supposed to take care of her when we're at school? In turns. You and I have to figure a way how to stay home from school today. I wanna stay too. Me too. Only two of us. Mommy won't believe it if we all stay. It's not fair. Matt! I get to stay. She's mine. I found her. No she's not, you have to share. Not so. Matt, I'll give you my allowance this week. Hmm... Two weeks. Fine then. You stay here alone with her. And I hope that mommy finds out and blames it all on you. Okay, one week. Go get the bikes. [animated music] Okay, here we go. [David] I'm not tall enough. Cool! I'm pulling! More blankets. [David] Oh, man. Flowers. These flowers are real dumb. [Matt] Come on, mom will be upset. [gasps] [playful music] Okay. [Daniel] Good, David. What are you kids doing? Hmm... We're making a tent. With my clean blankets? [sighs] Come on, get ready for school. I'm gonna be late. [playful music] [shushes] Hurry up guys, come on. [thrilling music] David, hurry up. Daniel! [air blowing] Matt, sweetie, are you ready? We gotta go. I'm ready, mom. [moans] Who is this upside down boy? -[giggling] -What are you doing? [moans] That burnt! Oh, come on! [moans] Babies? You are burning up! [exhales] Maybe a should just cancel the appointment. No! I'm not that sick. But, I could take care of David. You should go. Remember? [in unison] We need the money. Okay. You guys get some sleep, alright? Okay. You need to finish, come on. Coffee. Hot, black coffee. Coming up. [moans] The network gave us our season finale -party last night. -Aha. And then I spent all night arguing with Sam. At least you have a man, Molly. He is driving me crazy! Matt! You are late for school! Oh, Molly, you're an absolute life saver for doing this for us. -Hey, let's go! Bye! -Yeah. We're late. Decaff? -[lively music] -[trumpets softly] -[siren wails] -Hold it right there, lady. Good morning, Hanna. How are you? Hey, Harrison! Hey Lucky! Guys, I'd love to share a donut or something, but we're late for school as usual. So, if you could just move the car... [chuckles] You did lock your door before you left? Well, no! Why? There have been a lot of robberies in the neighbourhood lately [Hanna] In Shadow Hills? Hi officer Harrison! Hi buddy! How are you doing? Okay. Well, Hanna, if you need anything... I know, Harrison. You're four doors away. Let's go Lucky. Remember Hanna, I'd do anything for you. -I know. -Just call me. -I'll be there. -I'll be sure to call you. [lively music] [groans] Do you think she'll like broccoli? Well find out. [moans] A zit! A big fat zit. Look! Isn't this appalling? Grossed out! Disgusting! Disgusting? She's eating half the yard. I know, but she's still hungry. Aren't you, Malaika? We gotta find a way to take care of here, David. The internet! Good idea! E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T-S dot com. [beeps] Wow! 9.262 entries! God, that's a lot. Elephants bathe themselves in mud to keep their skin protected from the sun. -[both giggling] -[joyful music] [moans] [laughing] -[moaning] -[laughing] [trumpets] Thanks a lot. Okay, so... How can I help you? Yeah, I lost an elephant. [suspenseful music] An elephant? Well we don't get many elephants around here. Well, except for the LA zoo. Have you ever been to the LA zoo? I mean, they got big elephants there. Don't they, Bill? Yo, Bill. [speaks indistinctly] You got any elephants back there? [laughing] Look, we're just trying to be helpful but I just got a message that there's a tyrannosaurus down in San Diego. [laughing] Yeah, we gotta go. I lost an elephant. An African Grey. Hmm. Those are those ones with the long noses. No, those are the Asians. Aren't they? [exhales] This is my name and address. I'll expect to hear from you. Hmm. We'll do our best to find the elephant. -Yeah. -[taps] [chuckles] -[laughing] -[trumpets] Who are we gonna rob next? [Thelma] Wake me up when you decide Loui. No, not them. They look like the shop at Cheap-mart. [Thelma] Huh. Like the last place you picked. Instead of silverware they had Tupperware. [lively music] Hmm. Sam, sweetheart, I promise I fell asleep on Hanna's sofa. Matt, help. [Matt] I'm on it! Oh, man! Sweetheart, I promise. I fell asleep on Hanna's sofa. [Daniel giggles] This is funny. [Kelly] Not if we get caught. [moans] Malaika! Watch the wire! [Molly] Sam, [indistinct] on the tree. [wire snaps] Hello? Hello? He hang up on me! I can't believe it! I told you to dump him. Yeah, you did, didn't you? Don't worry, Molly. I'll be your boyfriend. Aww, Matt, thank you. Thank you. Did you get the job? Did Mr. Beany like the campaign? Agh! He was such as sleazebag! Agh! I walked out. [groans] Just having a man on the house... I know what you mean. [sighs] I can't do this alone anymore, Molly. I need help. What you need is a housekeeper. Somebody you can hire and fire easily without having to divorce them. Then you just get rid of them. Molly, I can't afford a housekeeper. I can't even afford to feed these kids! Do you realize how much they eat? There's nothing left in this house. Hanna, I'm going to help you. -Molly! -I'll give you some money. Put that away. I told you before. I can't accept that. -Come on! -No. I will not accept that from you. You know that. Besides, what these kids need is a father. They have no male influence. You realize it's been four years since Alan died? So, are you gonna help me find a husband or not? -[giggles] -Maybe you don't know anybody who'll date an aging stressed-out widow with four unruly kids. A challenge. Fine. [Hanna] What are you doing? Let me see. No, too young. Even for you. Too young. Hmm, banker... Hmm. -Podiatrist. -No. Rich. That's what you need. Really rich. [moans] -[lively music] -[flies buzzing] It's humongous! What are we gonna do with it? I ain't moving it. No way! Come on! It's only nature. Yaky? [trumpeting] [Daniel] Kelly, don't touch... the poop. Yikes! [moans] [Thelma] Thelma and Louie, hey! We're the new Bonnie and Clyde. With flavour. [Louie] Nice car! Maybe they got a nice crib. Nice crib. Yeah, we're the lucky ones. [Thelma chuckles] Lucky ones. [Louie] Big stealing easy living, bingo! [moans] This window is locked. Hand me a crowbar. We ain't got all day. Okay. Oh! Come on! I need a crowbar. What's the matter? A cat got your tongue? Hand me the crowbar, Thelma. [Thelma gasping] This is Louie, baby. Thanks. [gasps then screams] [screaming] [Malaika moaning] [continues screaming] Leave the ladder alone [screams] My butt! I should have been a doctor. -[thud] -[moans] Put the pedal to the metal. I'm coming, Thelma. Wrap it up. [Thelma] Hmm, Louie, let's make like eggs and scramble out of here. We gotta get out of here! What happened to-- [moans] [gasps] I'm coming Thelma! Thelma, wait for me! -Thelma! -[trumpets] [screaming and whining] -Watch out! -[tires squeal] [trumpets softly] [moans] -Malaika! -Kelly? Wait a minute! What in the world is going on here? Well, I can explain Explain? There's an elephant in my driveway and you have an explanation? Daniel found this elephant and... it was hurt and then we took care of her and we kept her in the corral and... And-- [stutters] Kelly, how could you guys keep a secret like that from me? We didn't mean to keep it a secret. When you don't tell someone something that they should know that is called a secret. If there is an elephant in my backyard, I think I should have known about it. Don't you? Come on, Kelly. Don't you think I would have found out about it? Don't you? Come on, you'll love her. Please. What are we supposed to do with an elephant? This is ridiculous. [moans] You're gonna love her! I'm calling the zoo. [shrieks] [suspenseful music] We don't have much time. Excuse me, you don't know me but there's an elephant living in my backyard and it's been shot. -Where is she? -This way. Come on, kids. My, my, my. [chuckles] God works in mysterious ways. [lively music] [zoo manager moans] What a beautiful Grey! Oh, my! [trumpets] [zoo manager] Look at her! [Nick] She let me walk right up to her. She must have been in the orphanage program With actually no fear of humans at all. -[zoo manager] Steady. -[Nick] Incredible! Steady. [moans] She's a lamb. [blows raspberries] How loving she is! [Nick] So, what do you think, girl? Can I take a look at that? Clean it up a little bit? I'm so glad you came to us. So, you can take her to the zoo, then? And take care of her? Did you know there is a man looking for this elephant? Well, I didn't think she appeared from nowhere. Yeah, I guess he figured whoever found her may report her to us. And he was right. Here we are. But this man plans to hunt and kill her. Isn't that illegal? Of course. So is jaywalking. Everyone jaywalks. [trumpets] If I take this sweet baby to the zoo, he's gonna claim her, take her and he'll kill her. [brooding music] I just don't know how I feel about this. I mean, an elephant in my backyard. Honey, you're doing a really great thing. This is gonna give us a chance to find her a home To find out where she should go back. Her family. We need to do that so she'll be safe. -Alright. -Thank you! Let me say thank you then. -Thank you. -How long? What are we talking? I mean, another day? Days... it could be three days. I just need you to... get in touch with the people in Africa. A lot of time difference. We'll work it out. [engine starts] Nick, so... you have to admit this a little unusual. Hmm... I mean, is there anything special we need to do with her? -Do I have... -[laughing] Is anything to worry about with the kids? Is it safe? Wouldn't she just walk away? I know I can tell you she treats those children like they were her own. I mean, I've never seen anything like it. Yeah. [moans] Neither have I. Hmm... If it just-- If it... would be okay, I'd like to spend as much of the time as I can here until we get her taken care of. Would that be alright? Hmm, I guess we don't have much a choice. Do we? [moaning and trumpeting] [brooding music] [Kelly] How embarrassing. Delivering pizza. [Hanna] If you want to keep an elephant we'll need the extra money. Okay, guys. Remember, stay down. I'll be right back. [lively music] [David] I hate pizza. It gives you zits. -Oh, hello! Here's your pizza. -Hello! -Thank you. -You're welcome. Okay. You're gonna eat that, all by yourself? -Yes. -Yes? There you go. Bye! Wait! Two, three. Here. Thank you! -Bye! -Bye! Guess what? We got our first tip. Yes! Come on. [kids whining] -[Kelly] Is not fair! -[Hanna shushes] [whispers] Be quiet. Stay there. [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [Kelly] This is ridiculous, mom. Come on. Come on, let's go. There is nobody home. -Yeah. -[chuckles] Oh, good. Your pizza, sir. You're late. Oh, I rang your bell exactly four minutes ago, so, that would have put me here in ¿ 28 minutes. Yeah, I didn't hear the bell ring. So the pizza is free. [stutters] Well, I-- -You wanna argue with me? -I was here-- -Huh? -No! -But I was-- -And with children! God damned kids! Quiet! And now gimme the damn pizza! -There! -Thank you a lot! Come on! [lively music] -[David] She's looking good. -[Nick] She sure is. You guys did a great job with her. [trumpets] Okay. It's okay. [dialing tone] Hello, is this Mr. Pilton? Congratulations, Mr. Pilton, you just won a free trip to Hawaii. Mr. Pilton? [line beeps] Retarded. This is a job. [dialing] [lively music] [trumpets] [Daniel] Shake in those hands. Right, Malaika? Really? Wow! You taught her to do that? [Daniel] Yeah, ask her to do it. Okay. Okay, girl. Shake hands with me. Come on, shake hands. Thank you! -[trumpets] -Very much! [dialing tone] Look, mom. -I like worms. -Don't put that in your mouth. Oh no, not you, ma'am. -Mom... -Is this Mrs. Jackson? Congratulations, Mrs. Jackson! You just won a free trip to Hawaii! -I'm hungry. -Yes! You and your husband. Shh! No! Not you! So, you've been to Hawaii? [screams] No, no! Aha. Exciting. Aha. Oh, Thai food? [screams] No, no! -[blows raspberries] -Thank you. Thank you. Hi Nick. She likes you. Yeah, I kinda like her too. She's gonna be okay. She's gonna be just fine. -Just fine. -Malaika? Kiss... Kiss him. -[blows raspberry] -[smacks kiss] Thanks. [trumpets] [Daniel] What did you get? [Hanna] Leave some for us. [David] But she's hungry, mom. [Molly] Don't cook, I'll cook. You? You don't know [Molly] I'll order out and you don't have to do that? Yeah? You have to get dressed. Why? You have a date. -What? -[chuckles] His name is Graham. -[stutters] -He'll be here in one hour. -Now go! -But Molly! Shoo! He's rich. He's a stock broker. He's my stock broker. Let's get you dressed. [lively music] Hello, boy? What's your name? Hey! Don't do that! -[drizzling] -[laughing] Hey! Stop that! [all chuckling] [gasps] Oh, I-- I am... so sorry. They're never like this. Are they, Molly? Never! Graham, sweetheart, -never. -[chuckles] [exhales] [lively music on the radio] [Hanna coughs] Some car, huh? Oh, you're home so early. -[both smack kisses] -Hello, Molly. [giggles] Did you have a good time? Fantastic. -[chuckling] -Unbelievable. [Molly moans] [Hanna giggles] [all laughing] [chuckling] Oh, good! Well... the kids are fast sleep. I gave them your recipe, the milk and the honey. And they won't wake up for anything Not anything at all. So, good night. Molly, are you sure you won't stay and have tea with us? I told you. I have my annual live with the wives photo session in the morning. -I have to get my beauty sleep. -[chuckles] -Have fun! Bye! -Thanks, Molly! [Molly] Oh, you're so welcome! [lively music] [trumpets] [moans] You know? This is very rural. Very rustic. It's almost like nature here. That's what they call it. -[Graham] Oh, yeah. -Hmm... Graham, thank you for a lovely evening. Don't mention it. Molly didn't tell you -I have four kids, did she? -[laughs] [laughing] No. Does that bother you? [laughs] Absolutely, I don't know anything about kids. But I know what I like. And I like you. Oh! I-- Oh, my God! Oh, I'm sorry! A 25 hundred dollar alligator, ruined. I'm sure the alligator didn't mind. -Huh? -Oh, I'm sorry. Can I help you with that? [moans] Oh! [sighs] -I'll call you. -[snorts] [laughing] Sure, you will. -[laughing] -[festive music] Happy 4th of July! [sirens wailing] I'm worried about Malaika. Don't worry, she's not going anywhere. -[lively music] -[trumpets softly] [festive music] [lively music] [festive music] [lively music] [Malaika moans] [trumpets] [playing trumpets] -[lively music] -[moans] [festive music] [trumpets] [trumpets] [trumpets] [festive music] [trumpets] [trumpets] [trumpets] [brooding music] [Hanna chuckling] How is her hangover?

And show some cleavage. Oh, I gotta go. Thanks, Mol. -[wood cracking] -[Nick] Hey! Well, maybe she is not that okay. [soft music] Don't you have a hot date that you have to be getting ready for? Yeah. Cause I can finish up here and I'll take care of the children. Are you sure? Yes, cause... this is a job for... veterinarian man! [chuckles] Okay, veterinarian man. Do your stuff. Go away. Actually, would you zip me up, please? I can't reach. Hmm? Mmm, thank you! You're welcome. Oh, I didn't know it was you. Why do you have to go out this night? You went out last night. -Sweetheart-- -Is not fair! [sighs] Honey! I promised. Mom, can we get a video, please? Sweetie, I don't have time. [groans] Maybe I can be of some service. I don't mind going on the video store if you guys tell me what you want. How about Mary Poppins? Since we don't have a mother who takes care of us. We could see someone who does. -[Hanna sighs] -Okay, I tell you what. If you guys would go and get in my car, I'll take you to the video store whit me. If your mom says is okay. -[Hanna] It's okay with me. -Let's go! [Matt] Yes! I get front! [melodic music] -[Hanna chuckles] -You're welcome. Incidentally, I wanted to tell you that...

[smacks kiss] Hi, mommy. Hi, sweetie. We're going to the park tomorrow with Greg. You'll like him. -[lively music] -[kids chattering] -[whines] -[Greg] Whoops! Too bad! [Matt] That hurt. How was your date with Greg last night? He was fine. We don't like him. Oh sweetie, you don't even know him. Maybe you'll like him better when you get to know him more. I doubt it. [Hanna] Why? He's not Dad. I know, sweetie. I know. [Greg] Okay, rocket man. It's time for touchdown. Watch the hair. Thanks. I think the kids had a really good time. [whistling] -Oh! I-- -I'll call you. [Hanna] Okay. [mimicking kissing] Grow up, Nick! [door opens then closes] [engine starts] [thud] [gasps] What's going on? Get in here! All of you. What's going on here? They're mean to me, they don't like me. Cause Greg likes me, not them. I don't want Greg to like me! Why don't you guys give someone a chance? Someone to do guys things with. Kelly, you and I could do girls things together. Yeah, right. All I wanna do is spend time with you, not some stranger. Well, if you spend time with someone, then they're no longer a stranger. Don't you get it? -[exhales] -[lively music] [growls] [growls] [trumpets] [trumpets] [trumpets] [camera clicks] Hey, buddy! Do I never get to see any of these great pictures you've been taking? Not likely. No film. But I really like this camera. Because it bugs at Molly. -[chuckles] -Don't tell anyone. We keep it just between us men. Five that. I don't know, Molly. Maybe I just need somebody more practical. [sobs] Yeah. [sniffs then sighs] Aww, are those tears? You guys don't have to be so upset over me. [laughs] Nick, do you wanna stay for dinner? [Nick] I would love to. Good. It gives me an excuse to order Chinese. [brooding music] [playful music] [Nick] She'll be home in a few days. [Hanna] I'm really gonna miss her. [Nick] Yeah, I know. Me too. [Hanna screams] A giant underwater squid -[Nick chuckles] -[Hanna] Someone help! -[Nick] Oh, no! -Get out of there. You're gonna get dirty. Come here, let me look at you. [smacks kiss] I gotta go get some more stuff. -Hi. -Hi. I think I may have something for you. [trumpets] -You wanna know what it is? -I wanna know. You know what this book is about? It's about the elephants. Oh! Even though elephants are big and strong, they need to be cared for and loved just like people do. [trumpets] And this is an Indian elephant can you tell the difference by the shape of his head? [Matt] That's a mastodon. It's an elephant dinosaur. All different sizes and shapes. That's the trunk. Let me show you something. Hang on. Wait a second. Can you come to my play tomorrow? Sure, I'd like that. Thank you. Okay. [trumpets softly] Hey! You're good with him. Hey! Let me help you. Oh, thanks. I think he is a good boy. Very nice children. Very nice? Yeah. Petunias are nice. Clouds. Fluffy white clouds are nice. That's a really nice elephant. Listen, maybe you've noticed I tend to go right to the point on things... These children are better than very nice. These children are brilliant, fantastic children! Cheetahs run faster, horses are stronger and whales, well, they swim better. You don't get out much, do you? [chuckles] Nope, I don't. Just animals are more predictable than humans. You like Hanna? Please, don't compare her to a wombat or something. I like Hanna. -Enough to marry her? -What? -Marriage? -Marriage. -It's a conspiracy. -No. Oh yeah. And I'm gonna play [indistinct] on this. In the interest of not wanting to incriminate myself in front of a prejudiced witness. [clucking] Chickens are squeamish. You didn't say no, did you? [moans] [moans then trumpets] I bet you, it says that. Look. Kelly, sweetheart, tell me about Africa. We had a farm in Africa. It overlooked the Serengeti plains. -[Nick] Really? -Every night, my dad would tell us a story. -Cool. -My daddy died in Africa. Shut up, Danny! David, you shut up! Knock it off, kids. -[Molly] You're okay, Daniel? -[Daniel moans] [Hanna] Come on, guys. Let's clean up. [suspenseful music] Come on, we're running late. Jeez, come on, hurry up. Can I help you with something? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. -[soft music] -[trumpets] [moans] Well, I know it's here somewhere. What? Ahhh! So, for your camera. I don't know what it is. Well, it's film for your camera, so you can take pictures. Real pictures, just like your dad did. You know something? I bet you [indistinct] -[lively music] -[Nick] Okay. Hop on. The day after tomorrow? I can't believe the kids have to say goodbye already. I mean, how is she going to get back to Africa? Who is going to pay for the ticket? It's too soon. It's just too soon. [chuckles] Don't worry about it. Save the Elephant Fund, they wanna do a new add campaign. [Hanna] You're kidding! That's great. I'll call them. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Why don't you pick up the phone? -[phone ringing] -It's never for me! -Hello? -[Nick] Hanna! - Something? -Who is it? -It's Nick. -There is an emergency. - and-- -Oh, really? -[scoffs] - No, really! A hippo is giving birth at the zoo and you-- Well, not actually. Could you just tell Matt-- Right. Well... - No . -Matt will be disappointed. - I know . -But... Don't worry about, I'll just ask Greg to go instead. - I'm worried . -Hmm. - Look-- Hello? -Bye. Mom, you didn't have to be so mean. Dad would have never missed a show. He is not Dad, so get over it, alright? [dialing] Greg? It's Hanna. I was wondering what you were doing this afternoon? [lively music] -Well, I made it. -Oh, good. [chuckles] -Hey, buddy. Break a leg. -Fine. [Greg] I'll be watching. -You wanna sit here? -Yeah, sure. [oriental music] [speaks indistinctly] This is Marrakech, my friends. [indistinct] Welcome to my home. [public laughing] [public booing] Matt? He won't tell me what the problem is. -[Hanna] Okay. -I gotta go. Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry about what Greg did, baby. That was wrong. He didn't look. He wasn't looking. Okay. I know, baby. Some people are too self-centered to be part of a family. We're better off without him. I don't want another daddy, Mommy. I just want you. I just want you too, sweetheart. Look, Greg, I... I don't think this is working out. So, are you gonna order in some Chinese? What? No! You and I. We are not gonna work out. [lively music] [kids] Come on, Malaika. Move over. Come on, Malaika. Come on, you can do it. Come on, Malaika. [farting] Yes! You know? You're a little too old for me anyway. What? Deal with it. I gotta go. [sighs] [playful music] [sniffing] [exhales then sniffs] -[whines] -[kids laughing] -[Malaika trumpets] -[laughing] [trumpets] [laughs] He is so cheap. [moans] He sent me the cleaning bill. Young and cheap or old and rich. [suspenseful music] Hello! Is anyone here? Hanna? It is Harrison, the cop. Come on, Molly, quick. Go upstairs and stall him I just don't want him to come down here and see the elephant. -Hello? -Oh! What do you know? Hello, officer. It's Sargent. Sargent Harrison Taylor. Are you... Molly De Mornay. -Yeah. -Star of the night time Soap Lives of their wives. We just finished our eleventh season. -Yes -[both chuckle] And what can I do for you, Sargent Harrison Taylor? [chuckles] Well, first of all, It's a pleasure meeting you. [both chuckle] I must admit I'm a bit embarrassed. Yeah. I'm here to check out a report of a missing elephant. [chuckles] You see? We catch these two cat burglars last night and they insist they had seen an elephant here. -[both laughing] -I love it! Oh, my. Well, we could check under the bed. [both laughing] Let me make you a cup of coffee. And we can talk about this elephant of yours. -You betcha. -[moans] [suspenseful music] [chuckles] Hey there, what do you say? [Jack] Give me a drink. Hear the one about the monkey and the goat? Seems like this monkey was climbing up a palm tree-- Did I ask you for funny stories? No. Hey, I'm just trying to be friendly. [scoffs] Friendly. A friend would be the first one [indistinct] Who was that somebody that poisoned your soul, Jack? Huh? Standing besides me is the arresting officer Harrison Taylor. Officer Taylor, I understand that they were armed. No, they weren't. [reporter] Weren't armed? [Sargent] No, they were unarmed and actually pretty harmless. They admitted to everything. We didn't have to beat them up or interrogate them. They were kind of nice. So they were insane. No, I didn't say they were insane. They said they saw an elephant at someone's backyard. I don't think there's much of a story here... Thanks a lot. [phone ringing] -Hello? -[Nick] Hi Hanna, It's-- Oh, Nick, hi! [Nick] Hi. Can I speak to Matt? Yeah, he is right here. Just a minute. It's for you, Matt. -Hi! -[Nick] Hey, Matt. I'm really sorry about the play. It's okay. My mom wants to talk to you. [Nick] She does? Hanna? -Hi. -[Nick] Hi. Hmm... So, how's the hippo? [Nick] Well, it really wasn't a hippo. It was a gorilla. He's fine now. He wasn't even-- Nick, I'm sorry about the other day. [Nick] Oh, me too. It was my fault. So, tonight I was thinking maybe I could take you out to dinner. Do you think you may be interested? Of course I would understand if you weren't. Oh! Hmm, no! I mean, yes! I'd be interested. [Nick] You'd be interested? [chuckles] Really? Umm, okay. What about seven, is that okay? Pu that away. Seven would be great. [Nick] Don't worry about a sitter, I have a plan. -[kids screaming] -I have to go. -[Nick] Hello? -I'll talk to you later. [Nick] Hello? Bye. [suspenseful music] Where is the money, Johnny Boy? [moans] You find it? No, aren't we eager? You are a wonder Johnny boy? No, I haven't found it. Until then I'm gonna need a little more money. I've paid you. We've had a couple unexpected expenses. I need to talk to some man right away. This little talk... it's gonna cost about 20 grand. I gave you plenty. Can't you pay for this talk yourself? You ever done time? in Grey Rock Hotel, Johnny boy. Alright. I'll be back for the cash tomorrow. Don't worry, you won't be sorry. I'm already sorry. You're the worst thing that's ever happened to me. [scoffs] Well, it's early yet. [Matt] Why can't we go with her? [Kelly] It's too expensive. Hey, you guys. Guess what? I got a surprise for you. What is it, mama? I got a new job! What is it? I get to do the Safe the Elephants ads. [kids] Wow! -Is that some fun? -[trumpets] It means traveling to Africa. [trumpets] Oh! Can we go too? Maybe. If you're really good. Come on, let's celebrate over lunch. -[suspenseful music] -Mister Garrett, are you sure you wanna bail these two out of jail? You bet. I'm real fond of these two boys. You see? I'm their uncle. [gate opens] Here are your boys. They're ruined? Their uncle, huh? Yeah, my family got around. Sign there. Say hello to your uncle Jack, boys. Hello, uncle Jack. [playful music] [melodic music] [Hanna] Where are you taking me? Nick, I can't see anything. Watch your step. Oh, my goodness. This is beautiful. [smacks kiss] Beautiful things for a very beautiful lady. This is incredible. Hanna, this whole thing it's incredible. You know? My life has been closer to animals than the medium guy? I never would have thought that I would have been introduced to the most beautiful woman I've ever seen by an elephant. [both laughing] [chuckles] An elephant. Well, who knows? May be someday we'll have baby elephants together. [both chuckling] I would have guessed? [brooding music] [clicks] [clicks] [moans] [moans] [roars] [roars] [trumpets] [trumpets] It's Malaika. Something is wrong. I'm going down there. [trumpeting] Stay here. Mom! Stay here. [trumpeting] Call Nick. [roaring] Get your shoes. [thrilling music] [trumpets] I figured you would show up sooner or later. I see my favourite pet has been well cared for. Perfect for the hunt you're planning? I see somebody could keep their mouth shut. She belongs to us now. [Jack] She's mine. [Hanna] You'll never get away with this. [chuckles] I already have.
