See the most fantastic terror thrills the screen has ever brought you. Beware. - The first Roman Grocer film I ever saw was called Scream Queen Massacre, the one where the bathing beauty contestants were stalked and killed by the raving, psycho maniac. I was 10 years old and that was when I decided to become a filmmaker Slaughter Studios in its day was the best. Roman Grocer had produced 122 films here, and I have seen every single one of them. But we were - Not cooked, you? Is cooked. This was a lobster. No, one lobster, a giant lobster. Lemme talk to the boss. I don't know how many you've seen, but I have a few of my favorites. Lumberjack, my dad took me. After 10 minutes, he wanted to leave the theater but I talked him into staying. Fungus, I loved the - It'll grow on you. His first and only western, Tin Can Kelly. Brilliant. Hobbes, the only feminist I can recall. Cherry Hill High. Loved Cherry Hill High, just because. Of course, Rock n' Roll Diner, which I first saw with my little brother. This film made my brother piss his pants. Too bad the Justin Kirkpatrick thing had to happen. - Where the fuck are my actors?! - Hey, you don't have to wait for me, Roman. - You don't have to wait for me either, baby. - Mr Kirkpatrick! Mr Kirkpatrick! Mr. Kirkpatrick, they need you on the set. They're ready for you. - We're almost done, one minute. - That feel okay, Justin? - You know some of this tape's pinchin' me, man. It's fuckin' cold. - If you think it hurts now, wait 'til we take it off. Jesus. - Where have you been? Can you get on set, please? - Alright, alright. - I'm waitin' forever. What the hell took you? Come on! Tryin' to make a movie here, will ya? Put yourself where you're supposed to be. Okay, is everybody set? Is everybody in places? Could we have some quiet? Alright, roll sound! - Speed! - Roll camera! Mark it! 78-1, mark. - Are we ready? Action! - What're you whacked-out horse bags doin' here? How many times I gotta tell you to stay away from my club? If it ain't Rock Candy, all rag and sweet-like. Ooh. - Oh yeah? That's the way you want to play it, huh? Huh? Let's go,. You want a piece of me? You're goin' down, bitch. Down. - No way, Rock Candy. Eat lead! - Cut! Cut, cut! What the fuck was that? Nobody dies like that in a Roman Grocer film! Nobody! Ya understand, Justin? Justin! Justin! - Justin? He's not movin'. - Call an ambulance, Justin's been shot! - That was the last film ever made at Slaughter Studios. It's been rotting away for more than 20 years now. Some say this place is haunted and the ghost of Justin Kirkpatrick still roams these hallways and empty sound stages to this day looking to finish his last film. That's where we come in. - Steve, what have you got up your sleeve? - A secret plan, Madi. He's right on time like clockwork. - What's so secret you can't tell your own girlfriend? You'll find out along with the others. - Naughty Sex Kittens versus the Giant Praying Mantis? - We're gonna make it in the truest tradition at Slaughter Studios. No time, no money, it'll be great! But we've got to hurry before they demolish the place. - How many weeks? - Nine hours. - Nine hours? - That's right, tonight! - How are we possibly gonna do that? - Digital video. Everyone's goin' digital these days. Gary's got a camera, it'll work. Tell 'em, Gary. - I've got a camera, it'll work. - Now what we do need is four or five great-looking actresses who can stay up all night and do nudity for free. - I've got some girls in my class. They'll totally do it. - Great! - Some of them are actually good. - It doesn't matter. This script is bulletproof. Bring as many as you can; any actors as well. - Dammit! - I'm sorry. Sorry. - Yeah. This is Kevin. - Hey. Hi, hey. - Hey. - This is Steve, Madigan, Gary. - Hi, how are ya? - Nice to meet you, Kevin. It's a pleasure. - Alright get a seat, Kev. Kevin is classically trained. He studied in London; Shakespeare for four years. He's great. - Is that so? - Thou art a fellow of good respect. Thy life had some smatch of honor in it. Take then my sword and turn away thy face while I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato? Farewell, good Strato. Caesar, now be still! - That was amazing. - Thanks. - Can I be in it? - Sweetheart, I was hoping you'd do makeup and wardrobe. - Oh. - Hello Sex Kittens, what is up? I'm seeing party started without me. Did I miss anything? - Well Ollie, only the greatest opportunity of your life. , Count me inside. Ready to do some acting? - You bet. What's my role? - Brilliant. The movie is only as good as the monster is bad. - That's pretty awful. - Did you remember to pack the blood? - A whole gallon. - Great! Here they come. Hello, hello! - How ya doin'? - Great! - Ready to meet your cast? - Absolutely. - Alright. Here you go. Rebecca, this is Steve. - Hi, Sam. What's your name again? - Steve. - Oh hi Steve, I'm Rebecca. - It's a pleasure. Nice to meet you, Rebecca. - Nice to meet you too. - Lovely, very, very. - Hi there, Darlene Valentine. - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Darlene. I'm Steve. Very beautiful. - Oh, hi. - Hello. - Hey, I'm Candyce. I'm here to meet Justin. - Nice to meet you, Candyce. Very, very nice. - Oh no, germs too rampant. I'm allergic. - You are? - Portia, like the car only spelled so you can understand how to pronounce it. - Portia, charming. - Listen, I've never done one of these monster flicks before. I don't wanna leave that slimy stuff on my body otherwise I'll walk. Oh be a doll and carry this for me, will ya? - She's just a little bitch. - Hey there, everybody. I'm Chad Daniels. Glad to be here. - Hello Chad, I'm Steve Sperg. Nice to meet you. - Right, bro. You're the man. - Yes, I suppose. - Right. I'm ready for my up-close, Mr. - Hello, Ollie. - Do your worst. I gave him all the script I have. I kinda noticed there wasn't that many lines. - I only counted 8 1/2 lines for my part. - Yeah. - Yeah, what's up with that? - That's because this is a conceptual horror story about the obsessive love between humans and overgrown nature. We'll be improvising most of the lines. Right this way. - He must be a genius. I'd kill for eight lines in a movie. - You counted them? - Gather 'round, gather 'round. The only thing we must watch out for is a security guard who makes his rounds five minutes 'til every hour at which time we must shut off all the lights until he's finished. Let's make history. We're going in! Gary, help me. - The fuck's in here? - This thing is heavy. Head back to the cage. Get away, you mortal. - Sorry. - What's the hold up? - Laughter Studios? Ooh, did they make comedies here? - Yeah, sort of. This way, everyone. This way. - Ooh god. Shit, this is. - It's so creepy. - Come on, everyone. I think it's right ahead. - Hey, can I get a flashlight? Oh god, my. I can't breathe in this dust. What's that smell? I am getting heebie-jeebie. - Do we have craft services on this shoot? You're gonna watch your step. - Shit, your tail. - Oh I'm sorry, Gary. - What a dump. - I'm gonna see Justin. Justin was. I don't have any flashlights or. - Huh, who's that? I'm supposed to star in this and I don't even have a flashlight. - Alright already, Chad. - Disgusting. - Come on princess, move along up there. - Slut. - Excuse me? What'd you say to me? - Nothing. - Come back here and say that to my face. - Come on you guys, don't fight. We're making a movie. Oh jeez. Chad, are you okay? - Yeah. - Spider! - Shut up. - You don't understand. I'm allergic to spiders. - You know what? I'm allergic to you. Come on,. - Well if I could see, I wouldn't be fallin' over stuff. - Just stick close to us, okay? - I don't have another flashlight. Keep it moving. - Steve, do you know where we're going? - I think I see it. - I can't see anything and I need a flashlight. I bet Eric Roberts doesn't work like this. - Are we almost there? - It's down this way. It's down this way. Stage 17. - Why Stage 17? - That's where Justin Kirkpatrick was murdered. - It's just a rumor. - Crowbar. - No, it's true. He really was. - That was a cover up. - Guys, watch your step. Shut up, the security guard will hear us! - It's alright, he's alright. Security guy is deaf. He can't hear a thing just as long as the lights are out at the proper time, alright? - That's bad luck. - No no, that was Justin. I know it. It was Justin. - Enough with the Justin. - No, it was him. - Alright everyone, come on inside. Right this way. There we go. Right in slowly. I know it's dark. Don't worry, come on. Madigan, come on in. Here we go. Chad over here, come on. - Oh god, I can't believe we're actually making a movie. - Don't worry honey, you'll get used to it. - Where's my trailer? - Smells literal ca-ca here. Ooh! - Guys, look at that. What is that? - Comin' from? - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Welcome to Stage 17! So many great films shot right here. Madigan, clear this space. - Can I get a hand? - Where's my camera bag? - I got it. - Comin' through, excuse me. - Yeah, I heard you. - Thank you very much. - Where's prop services? - Yes, right over there. All you'll do. - You wanna help me with somethin', sweetcheeks? Oh, sure. - What's that? - I bought digicam to document this historic event. - Great idea, Ollie! - Thank you. Who is the man? - Can I see that? - Of course, dudie. Sexy, isn't it? You like that? - Oh shit, we have no batteries. - What? - Wait. No no no, I packed them. - There's no mistake. There is no batteries in here. - Dude, get the camera out of here. - Chad, would you please go study your lines? - I wish I could help, but I don't know what to do. I'm just an actress. - A monster? I'm afraid. - The batteries are in here, I know they are. Shit. - No, they are not in here. Do you wish to insult me? - No one's insulting anyone. Gary, where are they, Gary? - I swear I brought them. - I can't fuck with this bastard if he continues to insult me. - Please do not kill me. - Chad, what are you doing? - Practicing my lines. - Here they are. Magic, very funny. C'mon people, we got a film to shoot. - Shoot it with your gun now! - Chad, please! Go study your lines somewhere else. - I found one. - What? - Look. - Cockroach! - No, it's a bullet hole. Justin Kirkpatrick was killed right here in this very spot. It's sacred. - Jesus, get a therapist, will you? - Steve, where do the actors changE? - There's a dressing room across the hall. Okay ladies, let's go. - When's lunch? I need to eat. - Portia, we haven't even got much time sweetheart. - Alright, here we are. - Look. I wonder if Justin wore any of these clothes. - Yeah maybe, just look for the bullet holes. - I am not wearing any of this stuff. - You don't have to. - Does everybody have clean underwear? - What? - You're gonna be in your underwear most of the time. - But I don't wear underwear. - Don't worry, I brought some extra just in case. - So what do you think? - It's you. - Okay, let's all get dressed. - Candyce, are you ready? - Yeah, uh huh. - What's that? - It's my scrapbook on Justin. - God, I love him. Such a tragedy. - They say it was an accident. Nobody was murdered. - That's the man. That's the man that killed my Justin, Daryl James. He did, he killed my Justin. - She's just a good actress. - There's somethin' behind you. No! - Chad, Chad, Chad! Go to another room far away, please? - It's dark out there and there's spi-- - Find a room, turn on the lights, close the door and I'll find you when I need you, alright? - Okay, sir. Bye, Ollie. - Bye bye. Chad is quite friendly fellow, would you think? He's great actor. One day superstar, win Oscar. - Sorry. - I wasn't scared. - You okay? - Anybody have any scissors? Does anybody have scissors? - I think I might. - Hey, get outta here! - Oh my god, stop that. What are you doing? Some of your nipples are showing. - Ollie, what the hell do you think you're doing? - I am making super-duper documentary. - Document this. - Very real. Very real. - What about this? - Ollie, get out. - I'm going. I will to tell you we want you on set to take you. - We'll be right there. Okay? Good. - Document my ass. - Thank you, I will. - Get out. - Hey, where'd you get that? - From your scrapbook. - Give it back. - Gary? - Ready. - Roll camera. - Rolling. - Naughty Sex Kittens versus the Giant Praying Mantis. Scene one, take one. - Action! - Cut! - Cut? Portia, never ever say cut to the director. Not on my set, what's wrong with you? - I wanna take a break. - We haven't even started yet. - But I'm thirsty! - Just finish the scene then you can take a break, okay? - Okay, but I'm working under protest. - Roll camera. - Rolling. - Action! - Oh great spirits of the underworld, we call upon you to show yourself in flesh and blood. Repeat after me. Oh gentle fair one, we see you. - Oh my god, it's Justin! - Tell me you got that. - I got it. - It was, it was Justin. It really was, just like you said. - I told you. Did you see anything? - No, I saw something. - Think my eyes are playing tricks on me. - Justin. I saw you. I know you're here. - Did you have anything to do with it? - Not a bloody thing. - Can we take a break now? - Shit, the security guards. Kevin quick, cut the lights. Gary, Gary. I hope he didn't see anything. Madigan, you have got to watch the time. - You guys, where's Chad? - Don't turn around, something behind you. Run. Don't turn around. There is something behind you. Run. There's something behind you. Run. Don't turn around. There's somethin' behind you, run! - You're okay? - Hey, you guys want a strawberry? She wants a beer. - Yeah right, we'll be back. No, no! - You guys, what was that? - Chad. - Was that real? - No he's doing his lines badly, I might add. Madigan, come with me. Remember, no lights. I wonder where they're going. - Steve, where are we going? - This way. - I can't see. - Neither can I. There he is, right on schedule. I need you to keep watch. - You want me to stay up here in the dark all alone? - Yeah, that's right. - Forget it. I have heard of combinations. - C'mon everyone, no lounging around. We got a film to make. C'mon everyone, let's get set up. This is the romantic scene. Get the lights! - So how was it? - Will someone please find Chad? Madigan? - Where is he? - I don't know, find him. Where's the tent? Where's the bloody tent? We had it right here. - Chad? Chad? You're needed on set. Chad, is that you? Chad? Chad? - C'mon people, we still got seven more pages to fill in this hour block and we've only got 34 minutes left. Hustle up! - I can't find Chad. - Go look again. - I have to do makeup. - Did you look everywhere? - No, the place is too big. - Let's hope he left. He wasn't very good. - Fucking actors! Alright, we can film around it. - He's the lead. - We'll have to make due without him. - Hey Steve, I could do it! - Right, Ollie. - Yes? - Come here. You, my friend, are now Hamilton. - Goodie gumdrops. I am now big gonad like daddy. - Wait, who's gonna do sound? - Ooh good. - Madigan? - Where's Chad? - I think he went home. - If I wasn't such a committed actress, I'd be right behind him. - Quiet please, quiet! - And-- - I have to pee. - Not now. - Okay, I'll just pee in the tent then. - And action. - Tanya, I've waited so long to caress your firm bootay. - Oh Hamilton, I've missed you so. - But Darlin', where are the others? - I sneaked out of the slumber party while they wasn't lookin'. - Ooh, you naughty minx. I long to mount your molten milk jugs. - Ooh, I long for you. - Who's your daddy? - Take me, take me! Take me, Hamilton. - I will! Come on. - Stop it! - God what the fuck was that, Portia? - He's tryin' to take my top off. - That's what the script calls for. - I would very much like to do that scene again. - I don't care, I will not do nudity unless I get paid for it. - I got a quarter. - Is that what you get paid? - No, but it would be a pay raise for you. Okay, who wants to stand in for Portia? Jerk. - How long would I have to stand for? - I will. - What? Darlene? - I'd love to. - I feel distress. - And action. - Take me, take me. - Yes! - Oh Hamilton, take me. - I wouldn't lie to you. - Oh, take me. - I goin' to bite you. Ooh yes, come on. - Cut, brilliant! - Exceptionally sorry for the-- - It's alright. - This will edit nicely. Now let's finish the scene. Where's Portia? Portia? Portia. - I'm very upset. - What's wrong? Talk to me. - I have a chemical imbalance. - Here, take a couple of these. They'll relax you. Here. - What are they? - It's Somadome or something like that. I don't remember. All I know is I'd explode without them. - I need some water. - There we are. There we go. There we are. Take a minute, then come back alright? Sweet. Portia, Portia? Portia. Look, you're the best actress I've ever seen. Even better than Madonna. - I know. - And action. - Ooh Tanya, I long to pounce on the package of your pulsating action. - The room is spinning. Daddy has. I think there's someone outside. - Hello. - Hello. There you are, Tanya. We were looking for you at the slumber party. Who is your friend? - I'm Hamilton Bigfoot III. Hello, join me in my tent of love. - I'd love to. - That's it, lovely lovely. Room for more. Hello. - C'mon in, girls. - Come to Papa. - What are we doing? - I'm in a bad place. Perfect, lovely. - Sorry. - Good, let's get to the exit shots so we can set up the sequence. Madigan, how much time? - Two minutes, better shut it down now. - No no, we've got time. Roll camera and-- - What are we doing? - Just climb out of the tent. Everyone else stay put and go! - Now? - Yes, now. Go go go! - Me? - Shit, Candyce you just climb outta the tent fast and go! Cut! Brilliant, turn off the lights. The flashlights as well. Move it, move it. - Candyce, where you goin'? - I'm goin' to see Justin. - Hey, hey, hey. What are you doin'? - You don't have to hit me, I was only tryin' to stretch my arm. - She's gone over the edge. - She's great. Maybe it'll help her performance. - Justin? Justin. Where are you, Justin? Justin, I'm looking for you. - Dammit! - Getting out of here. - Eww. - Eww, that's stinky. It was not me, I am going to. - It must've been Portia. She's the only one still in there. - It doesn't smell like a girl did it. - Portia? - Portia. - Oh my god, the smell killed her. - Jesus Christ. Portia. Portia, wake up. Portia, Portia. - What's wrong, Steve? - She's sleeping. She's probably tired or something. - She must've been real tired to sleep through that. - Be nice. She told me she had some sort of chemical imbalance. Probably makes her tired. Kevin, get her outta the the tent. We're gonna need it. - Yeah okay, sure. - Justin, where are you? Come to me, baby. Right. When I went to the Chinese man's theater, I saw your hand print. I put my hand there, Justin. I placed it in your print. You're not gonna believe this, but it fit perfectly. It fit perfect. It was a perfect, perfect match. Plus I needed to come here and tell you I've been dreaming about you. I've collected everything of yours from the scrapbook from the beginning of your career to the end. Madigan, he's here. He's here. He's physically here in his physical form. I can see him, I can hear him. He's walking around me. Do you hear him? Ssh, listen. I'm serious, listen. Alright, fine. You don't believe he's here, that's fine. What's the next scene? What do we have to do? - We have to get back 'cause we're almost ready. Why don't you come along? - You think I'm nuts, don't you? - No, I just don't think you should be here all by yourself. - I'm not by myself at all. I got my Justin. I got my Justin. - Here we go, nice. Easy does it. Easy, okay. Alright, sweetheart. - It's called acting from the outside in. I think for your scene you should use this face. - That one right there? Like this? - Oh my god, that's so good. - You like that? - Have you done this before? No, but I've done this one. - I don't see that one on here. - Alright chief, we're onto the fantasy sequence. - Wait, where? - Company move. - What fantasy sequence? - Script revision. No dialogue, won't take long. C'mon everybody, right this way. Here it is. Here it is. Ollie, Gary! - Touch me again and I'll kick your ass. - Mind of its own. I can't control it, sorry. - What's the bed for? - It's a girl love scene. - Oh brother. - Who's fantasy is this? - It represents the changing nature of the duality of the human animal. Trust me, you'll understand once it's edited in. - Sounds like bullshit. - You wouldn't understand, it's art. - Right here, light it low Gary. - I would very much like to be in lesbian love scene. - I need two actresses for this. - Count me out. - I'll do it. - Not you. Darlene? - Sure, what the hell? I'll do it. - Come here, sweetie. - Candyce? - Want to get down with brown? - Candyce? - No I don't think Justin would like that, would you? - Rebecca? - Steve, c'mon. - You just shoot the pictures, Gary. Rebecca, sweetheart. - Why do I have to do it? Why can't Ollie do it? - Tell me when this is done. - Lemme talk to you for just one second. - I just don't know how this could be good for my career. - What are you talking about? This could be the best thing that has happened to your career. - How can that be? - Truest test of an actor is when an actor has to play a role that is in direct opposite to that actor's real character. - You mean if I had to play a man, then it would make me a better actress? - Exactly! You hit the nail on the head. In this scene, the giant mantis has you so terrified that you take solace in the arms of another woman. You are like a man making love to that woman. - But I don't have a-- - It doesn't matter just as long, sweetheart, as you believe it. Nobody will notice. - Ooh, I get it. Okay, I'll do it. - That's the spirit. And action. Rebecca, go over to Darlene. That's nice. There we go. Darlene,, there we are. Kiss her. Good, good. Slowly bring her down to the bed. There we are. - Right there, right there. Take her. Cut! - Oops, wrong way. - Jeez, fuck! - You scared us. - Sorry, we need you two back on set. Alright we'll hurry, won't we? Sure. Okay, alright Portia. Gonna have to move this a little bit here, there we go. Nice and easy. Gotcha. Oh god, okay. Oh god, this is strangely arousing. Reminds me of seventh grade gym class. Oh, can I get a towel please? - I'm getting the creeps in here. - You getting the creeps? - I keep hearin' noises like somebody else is in here with us. - Me, too. - You, too? - There's so much film history. If I concentrate, I can hear the sounds of all the horror films gone by. It's like we're invoking the spirits of all these dead filmmakers. It will permeate the fabric of the story and get into the blood of my film! - Video. - Yeah, whatever. Okay, are we ready? Where's everybody at? Goddammit, late again. Kevin quick, cut the lights. Huh? - We're gonna get caught. He's already makin' his rounds. - Where the hell is Madigan? - I thought it was this way, but it all looks the same to me now. Oh wait. - Whoa! - Oh my god, Rebecca. Check this out. - Wow. - Oh my god, check this out. - Wow. - This is so cool. - Ooh cool. - Oh my god. - Look at-- - Oh my god, I haven't seen one of these. - Oh look at this. Cool. - Woo! - Yeah. - You shouldn't have done that to Rebecca. You know she's not very smart. You took advantage of her. - Gary, the process of filmmaking is a process of discovery. Rebecca made a discovery tonight. It's a beautiful thing. - I do completely agree with you, Steve. I, too, want to discover her boobies. - Cool. , Oh my god. Ooh, I like that beat.

No more Rebecca. I'll even take the camera with me. - You just shoot, Gary. I'm the director and I make the decisions. - Try me. - Steve, why don't you let Madigan do it? - Who's gonna do sound? - C'mon, lemme do it. I don't mind being naked. - Nobody wants to see you naked! - I am one person who would like to see her butt-naked. - Shut up! Trish, go get Candyce. C'mon, let's go, let's go! Portia. She can sleep all she wants, we just need her body. Kevin, go get her. - Okay. - Putting on the buttocks. Ass first, ass first. Ooh, me so horny. - Ooh yeah, there you go. - Come on. - You get her? I am, oh god. - Is that good for you? - Where is Madigan? - Yes. - Who's gonna do sound? - Be a true independent filmmaker. Go 95 using existing sound that the camera mic picks up. - Alright. C'mon Candyce, right this way. Here we are. C'mon sweetheart, yes. Alright, where's the blood? - In the tent. - Great, great. Remember girls, look dead when you're supposed to. Alright, inside the tent. Here we go, come on. Ladies, Kevin? - I am ready, Steve. - And action! Ooh Hamilton, you haven't had enough? - Don't stop, keep on goin'. Cut! That was brilliant! There we are. Take her outta the tent, just like that. Alrighty, that's it. That's it, yes. You are taking her back to your lair. Remember, you are the giant, evil praying mantis. Continue on. Very good. - Good, c'mon Portia help me out here. - I'm so tired. - Oh god, Steve is such a jerk. That tickles. I have to pee. - Ooh shit. - Ollie, what are you doing here? - Excuse me, please. I'm only here because the toilet is not working. Poo-poo will go everywhere. - Get out, get out! - Poo-poo is going everywhere. - Get out! Get out! - Here Madigan, you can put her head here. You're a good person, Madigan. - At least somebody notices. - Yeah. How'd you hook up with Steve anyway? - We had an editing class together. - Hey look, here I may be oversteppin' my bounds but he doesn't really seem to appreciate you for your talents. He's awfully mean to you. - I know. He won't even cast me in one of his movies, but I guess he's the genius. - Why do you say that? - Because he always tells me he is. Why would he lie? - I am so sorry. - That's okay. - I'm such a dork. - No, that's okay. Madigan! Damn! - Justin, where are you? Come to me. - Justin? - Yes. Come to me. - I'm comin' to you. - Yes. - You won't regret this. - Come into me, baby. Justin? - Hi, Candyce. - What do I have to do to be with you? Find me. - Justin? Find me, Candyce; I'm here waiting for you. Candyce. Come inside, be together forever. - I'm here. - I'm inside, Candyce - I'm comin' for you. Justin, I'm here. Where are you hiding? Come to me, Candyce. Find me. Come on, work work. - Gary, lights. Madigan, Candyce has wandered off again. We're gonna need her for the final lair of the praying mantis. Now go find her! Quickly, c'mon! - Steve, I am about ready... Okay. Shoot. What the hell? What is that? - Don't spill the blood. Are you gonna help us? - Anything you need, Steve. - Look, find Trish. She's gonna have to play queen of the moth eaters. - Steve, I would very much like to play king of the moth eaters. - Trish? Hey. Where are you? Goddammit. What the fuck? Oh Jesus Christ. What the hell is this? I found it hidden in the dressing room recording. - Whose is it? - It's Ollie's. - Why was it in the dressing room? - Why do you think? - We undress in there. My cousin, I wanted to make some money on the side. - Over my dead body! Steve please. - Can we hook this up to the monitor? - What for? - Maybe there's something here we can use. - I think I should go now. - Find Trish! - She wasn't in the dressing room. - Well go find her! - I can't believe you! - What do you want me to do? I have a film to finish! Where the hell is everybody? Fuckin' where's Ollie? Go find him, we need our leading man! - I'm gonna find him and rip his guts out! - Bring him back first, maybe we'll film it! - Alright Steve, it's ready. - I wonder what Chad looks like under those tight pants. He's your type. - What do you mean? - What, you haven't seen the way he looked at Ollie? - You mean he's-- - Yeah. - Huh. I wonder what Ollie looks like under those baggy plaid pants. - Eww, gross. - Steve is such an asshole. - I got my uterus adjusted today. - Really? - The doctor did it. It was really wild. He like pressed on my stomach and he pushed my leg over kinda like that. It's just so cool. - Alright Steve, c'mon this stuff is private. - Gary, you must learn that in filmmaking nothing I mean nothing is private. - Trish, Candyce? Ollie? - Oh shit! - Alright, this is boring. Nothing I can use. C'mon people, let's go, let's go. - What the hell? What is that? - Tell me it's not real. - Jesus Christ. - Is this is one of your fucking games, Steve. - Honestly, no. - Tell me it's not real. - Look, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna get everybody and round 'em up and leave, okay? - Why? Where are you going? - Steve you just saw that, right? Trish. - What about the movie? - The movie?! - Candyce, Chad, Darlene, Rebecca. There's someone else in here. - With black boots and dark pants. - Gary, Gary, wait up! We should stick together! C'mon, Madigan. Gary! - What about my film? - Gary! Gary! Gary! - What about Ollie? We have to help him! - What about my film? - Fuck your film, come on! Gary! Gary, no! - Ollie. Dammit! - Come on! He's this way. Oh my god, Trish. - Oh shit, who's doing this? Portia? Get up. C'mon, you gotta get up. Gotta get up. Good, gotta go. Ooh boy,. Gary! - Fuck. Shit, come on! - Here! - There's someone down here. - What are we gonna do when we get to save him? - We can try. Door. - Come on, we've got to get outta here. - Shut up! - Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. - Open it, Steve. - Madigan, you go ahead. I'll cover you. - Steve. - Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh. Be quiet, do you wanna get killed? Be quiet. Be quiet. - If you're gonna rape me, don't scratch my face. I'm an actress, you know. It's cold in here, I need another blanket. - Mother. Ooh, fuck. - Don't try anything weird. I'm not into that stuff. Go real slow 'cause I have a moisture deficiency. Don't try to kiss me either. I don't want any of your icky germs. Oh and bring me water when you're done. Ow. - Wear a condom. I don't wanna have an ape baby. - Come on, get dressed! - What are you doing? - We gotta get outta here. - Come back here and finish what you started, you bastard. - Shut up, Portia. - Don't you tell me to shut up! Nobody tells me to shut up! I'm leaving! Portia, come back! - I'm not coming back until you apologize. - Portia! Portia, come here! Portia! Portia, Portia! Portia. Portia! Portia. - It's me, it's me, it's me. - Where's everybody? - We have to get out. Shit. Ow! Ooh, please. - Madi, try the door. This way, c'mon. Whoa. - Oh my god! Candyce. They're all dead! - Let's get outta here. Welcome to Stage 17! A movie will never join the great ones. Masterpieces! Torture Chamber. Attack of the He-Woman. St Patrick's Day Massacre. Maniac. Motorcycle Mutants. Cut. - Steve showed me this room. - Can we go out through the window? It's pretty high. - Madi, isn't that his car? - What time is it? - It's quarter after, he should be there by now. - You're right. - Listen. His radio's on. He's not dead after all. - Let's get outta here. - Go go go go, Madigan go! - Kevin! Kevin, hold on! - Go go, run for the gate. Run. Go! Go! C'mon. Anyone else get out? - No. - Oh shit. - I know who the security guard is. - Who? - It's Daryl James - Who's that? - Do you remember in Candyce's scrapbook the face was X'd out? That's him. - You mean the guy who shot-- - Yeah, the guy who shot-- - Justin? Shit. Madi. Just in case. - Kevin, what's the plan? - Just keep your head down. Madi! - Whoa! Kevin! Kevin! - You killed them. You killed them all, you son of a bitch! - I didn't. - Then why are you chasin' us? - 'Cause I thought you killed them. - I thought you were deaf. - I may be deaf. I'm not dumb; I read lips. - So why are you were listening to the radio? - So people think I can hear. - Get out of the way, I'll knock his head in. - Madigan no, he's not the killer. - What are you talking about? - He followed us 'cause he thought we were. Look, look. He's got brown shoes, not black boots. - You're Daryl James, aren't you? - Yeah. - They said you disappeared after Justin-- - Justin tried to blow my brains out. That's how I lost my hearing. Felt sorry for me and he give me a job. - If you didn't do it and we didn't do it-- - Whoever did it, must still be back at the studio. - Oh my god. Oh my god, Portia. - Hey, where is everybody? I need some water! Hey guys, look! I found your ghost. Justin, woo! Hey! Where'd you guys go? Trish? Steve. Where are you? You guys playin' tricks on me? I don't know how I got hooked up with such a bunch of losers. - Folks shouldn't fuck with a man's house. It ain't right. Shouldn't fuck with him.
