Gaston Lei. Industrial businessman. 52 years old. My darling, my darling... - My Teddy bear wants to play? - Indeed I do. - What do you want to play? - Brigitte, I know you're there. - My husband. - Open up immediately. Out of the window. Come. Out of the window... No use hiding. I know you are with another man. - I'll kill you. - It's raining. - I'll kill you both. - Take the umbrella. Open up, in the name of the law. Brigitte, open up immediately. Open up or I'll slam the door. Open up. Brigitte, I know you are there. Open up immediately. Can you call a taxi, please? Thanks. Funny thing. Today, beauty has another meaning for me. It used to be something fleeting and unreachable, but now I feel as if I can take hold of it and keep it. Of course you can. You are a great artist. No, I'm not one yet. But now, at least, I have the chance to become one. I don't feel like it. You still didn't speak about your last trip to Paris. How was the sale of those lands? Everything perfect. Business is going very well. Business... that word brings old memories back to me. You'll soon be able to get back to them. I'll never get rid of this wheelchair. We had so much fun back then. After the accident, you should have done what any other woman would have done. Run away from me. I never told you, but now I'm happier than I ever was. Why? I feel useful. I have a task: Taking care of you. I was just an object before. Like a decorative figure you visited from time to time. I'm happy now too. I used to feel so tired. Full of problems and responsibilities... But I may be too much of a burden for you now. No, you're not. I'm just giving back a small portion of what you gave to me. Excuse me. A letter for you arrived, madam. Do you have to leave? I suppose so, my dear. Your trips are becoming more and more frequent. You arrived just a few days ago, and you'll leave again tomorrow. I need to. Each time you leave, I think: Will she meet other men? Will she have fun with them? Would they desire her? Don't say that. I know I can't blame you, but if I'd ever know you... To be opened en route. Top secret. Javier Echevarría. Neurologist. 42 years old. León Urrutia. Jeweller. 45 years old. This will be mission No.5. The previous ones were just a training. You may have opened the last envelope by now. Take a look at the two men in the pictures. They both have the same weakness: women. You must impress them. You must create expectations, but don't let them reach you. In the 20-page file No.3, you will find all the info you need: Topics to tackle, dresses to wear... Strictly adhere to my instructions and pay close attention. Don't use blue lenses today. Just show your grape juice green eyes. Are you happy with me, Mr. Decker? When will I meet you? - I admire you so much. - You can't fail. This mission is the most important one. Perhaps the last one. Our prize will be: One billion. Over. One billion. URRUTIA Jewellery I wouldn't buy emeralds. Why not? Your eyes are much more beautiful than that. Your necklace would go unnoticed. So what do you recommend, then? A woman like you doesn't need jewels. You must be Mr. Urrutia. A simple employee wouldn't dare to talk like that. My name is Desiree Charlier. A perfect name. Dr. Echevarría's wife. Even the most beautiful diamond has some kind of imperfection. I must confess I have a little bad habit. Can you guess? I can't, but I hope it's the same little bad habit I have too. Jewels. I love them. They overwhelm me. I can't help it, they drive me mad. Sorry to hear that. They don't mean anything to me. Mere trifles. I'll be honest with you. My husband has some money available, and I'd like him to invest it in jewellery. Can he deny any wish to you? Which amount are we talking about? I'm not certain. Around... one billion. Jewellery for that kind of investment is not commonly displayed here. Follow me, please. Here you can find the most perfect jewels you could ever dream of. These stones speak for themselves, as your beauty does. Their value would increase if you were wearing them. I want them so badly that it's like they were mine already. Wishing it is not enough to get what you want. I'll come back with my husband. I beg your utmost discretion. I still have to convince him. How I envy your husband. My name is Desiree Charlier. Mr. Urrutia's wife. Urrutia, the jeweller? Yes, he's my husband and he's the one who should be here, not me. I see. How can I help you? You see... Lately, my husband has been... Are you happily married? Not completely happy, but quite happy. - My husband, lately... - Any children? - My husband, lately... - Normal intimate relations? You see, my husband often grows a bit irritable and, let's say that he becomes too unloving. Mr. Urrutia must be very sick, don't you think? What else? He's suffering from a persecution mania. He's always thinking that someone is going to steal his jewellery, and he is suspicious of everybody. Tell me, why is he not here? I've tried to convince him many times, but he gets mad whenever he hears the word "psychiatrist". I'm worried. It may be a temporary state, work overload, fatigue... please let me know if anything else happens. It's a relief to know I can count on you. Call me anytime. I'd like to keep this visit secret. Is that possible? Of course. But... - For you. - Thank you kindly, madam. I'd like to open a current account in the name of Desiree Charlier de Echevarría. I want his initials on it. "J E", Javier Echevarría. Next Monday is our anniversary. My husband will forget about, as usual. He must be a very busy man. That's right. Too busy. Where shall we meet... to give you the lighter? We'll see... My dear, despite the distance between us, I feel so close to you. It's 7.30 pm. I'm sure you must be sitting at your piano now. Playing Mozart or Liszt... This new business is marvellous. Jewellery trading. I'm planning this transaction as if it were a battle. down to the smallest detail. I came to see you. But as you're leaving, we can talk now. I must meet my husband at the jewellery. - Would you mind taking me there? - Of course. How is he doing? He's getting worse and worse. He's bringing me very expensive jewels all the time. The Imperial 3 necklace, the Poseidon Diamond... But the cases are empty. And then he becomes insane, and shouts that he's been robbed. It's really awful. If you really want my help... Of course I do. I'm begging you please, Doctor. Then I'll have to carry out a medical examination. Of course, I understand. I had thought that... that the only way he can agree to this unsuspectingly is if you phone him, pretending you're interested in buying some jewels. - No problem with that. - Will you do it? Will you really do it? Nobody should see him entering the clinic. There are already rumours about his illness. Don't worry. I'll give instructions for him to be taken to my office directly. Your husband? It's a pleasure to see you again. I presume you have convinced your husband. Almost. That man was your husband? Correct. Let's see how the lighter looks. Perfect. Why did you bother to come? I would have brought it to you personally. I need you for other higher things. My husband will probably call you tomorrow. He wants to see the jewels. Would you mind taking them to the clinic? - I will go with you. - Of course, no problem with that. How's things, Echevarría? Excuse me, are you Dr. Echevarría? I'm Urrutia, the jeweller. We met just one hour ago, when you were with... Yes. What a coincidence. - I was going to call you tomorrow. - Really? Is there something wrong with your foot? No. Nothing. I see. You probably have a pain in the back of your neck, and you feel better doing that little work out, right? No, I'm in no pain. You said you were going to call me. Yes. I would like to buy some jewels. That's a really good idea, Doctor. I'm sure you'll love my collection. You continue doing that movement with your fingers. - So what? - Do you know what that means? There's a pressure in the back of your neck. No. I swear I don't feel any pain in the back of my neck. Is this yours? Why did you do that? I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. Just a professional habit. Well, then... it's been a pleasure. I'm expecting you tomorrow at 6, at my clinic. - Where's my car. - In the garage. The theft device stalled. - Give it to me, please. - Here you are. Please take a seat. He won't be long. Put them on the table, please. I can't wait to see my jewels. They're wonderful. I can't wait any longer. Do you mind if I take them to my husband? It won't be easy for him to say no if we're alone. As you wish. - Dr. Echevarría, please. - He's in his office. Would you mind giving this to him, please? And please tell him Mr. Urrutia is waiting for him. - The garage, please? - That way. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Isn't your wife coming with you? My wife? No. Where's yours? I'm not married. - I understand... - Did you like the jewels? Well, I couldn't say for certain. But I think the price... One billion, is that right? - Exactly. - ...is disproportionate. You're an expert, so, how much would you ask for this? My jewels. They stole my jewels. They stole my jewels. It was her. Who, Mr. Urrutia? Your wife? - It was her. - Take him away. She stole my jewels. She stole them. - Calm yourself. - I'm not married. I can't be calm. My jewels have been stolen. Let go of me. One billion pesetas, doctor. Let go of me. Call the police. Don't just stand there. They stole my jewels. It's one billion. Let go of me. I must find her. She stole them. She stole them. Police. My dear Terence. Everything is fine. I hope to be with you again soon. I miss you so much in this cold and ruthless business world. It's 6.30pm. You must be in the garden, finishing your latest painting. Don't forget your pills. The pink ones in the morning, and the blue ones in the evening. And don't overlook your recovery exercises either. And please don't sleep with your windows open, or else you'll get a cold. Excuse me, Monsignor. I long to be at your side to take care of you, but I still need a few days to finish this job. I'm flying off to Geneva today. You're under arrest. You'd better not offer any resistance, sir. You promised you wouldn't beat them so hard. I warned you. They don't have enough experience. I need men prepared to fight the underworld. If I were a criminal, those men would be dead or badly injured by now. Since you're just a lieutenant, they'll just need five weeks to recover. If you want success, I must choose my men personally. Congratulations. I really enjoyed your demonstration. And I'd like to talk to you in private. - Will you follow me? - Of course. Slowly, be careful... I don't. Thank you. I don't. Thank you. I sure you must have some weakness. Women, perhaps? I like them, but I don't think of them as a weakness. Of that I'm convinced. Myself, I love that sort of minor weakness. I must admit I can't live without them. That's your problem. Mr. Holmes, you're said to belong to a kind of man which is nearly extinct. The incorruptible ones. You defend the law, not as a simple duty, but as a priesthood instead. My father used to say: The law is the only thing that matters. Anything that goes beyond it must be destroyed, annihilated. I agree with him. You see, Mr. Holmes, I'm the director, manager and main shareholder of an important insurance company. A few days ago, an important jewel theft took place in Madrid. And if they don't show up... my company would have the unpleasant obligation, of paying the amount of one billion pesetas. which exchanged to pounds, amount to around... Some 6 million, two hundred and fifty thousand. A very annoying issue. Indeed. So what do you want from me? Simple. If you manage to recover those jewels, I'm offering you 10% of it all. That is to say, £625,000. I'll do it, but not for the money. Paid expenses and the usual allowances in a foreign country. My father used to say: Smash evil wherever you find it, expecting no reward. I would have loved to meet your father. Well Mr. Holmes, this is a very complicated mission. A beautiful lady, a jeweller and a psychiatrist. Jewellers and psychiatrists... just the kind of people I dislike. So you don't have a duplicate of the jewels? I don't. Why? Just because. They were unique items. Some jewellers make rhinestones of the jewels they sell. - Lieutenant... - Speak when you're spoken to. My jewels are insured. I didn't feel the need to make duplicates. So you didn't feel the need? And it looks like you didn't feel the need to request reports about a certain unknown lady... ...who came into your shop... ...with the humble pretension of acquiring jewels worth a billion. I never doubted she was Dr. Echevarría's wife. She also signed a cheque for me as Dr. Echevarría's wife. Didn't you suspect her when she left with the cases? Didn't you find it strange? No, not at all. You're a psychiatrist, aren't you? That's right. How much time do you need to assess a patient's mental state? Normally, you can see any sign of alteration at first sight. When you met Mr. Urrutia, did you consider him to be a normal person? Lieutenant, I'm absolutely convinced that there's no such thing as a normal individual. We all have some kind of weakness in our brain. You, for example. What's wrong with me? You work under excessive pressure. You spend too little energy. You need a better escape valve... than just rattling your key chain. Please disregard your diagnosis. I'm perfectly fine. You kept Mr. Urrutia, a healthy man, locked up for two days. And that prevented him from reporting the theft. It may sound right to you. Not to me. At least you'll be able to provide a detailed description of the woman. Tall and slim. Five foot eight. A blonde. She'd wear her hair up. Very big, green emerald slanting eyes. Her eyes were more like grape juice. Small nose, to ease contact with her lips. Her mouth was perfect... You should have seen her smile. She won't feel like smiling when I catch her. I wonder where she is now. What must she be doing now? She's not enjoying herself, that's for certain. She knows she's being relentlessly pursued and chased... She feels in constant danger. Her nervous system shattered by fear. I have 15 years experience in this job. Believe me. The offender can never rest. A real Ming. 24th Dynasty. You must be Madame Chantal. I was actually looking for a 16th Dynasty Ming. These are very hard to find. There's always a chance. Especially here, in Geneva. But you have to be patient and wait for the appropriate time. I'm a very patient person... when I need to be. Mr. Decker, in Amsterdam, said you could help me. He phoned me last night. How was your journey? Any complications? So, did you bring Renoir's 'Jewel Lady'? I'll try to find a buyer for your painting. But it's very difficult, with such a high price. It will be easy for you. It's a wonderful painting. Keep your distance with your left. That's it. Keep your distance. Protect your liver. Move your legs, that's it. Your legs. Prepare for one-two. One with your left, two with your right. One more time. That's it. One-two, one-two... Keep your distance... That's it. What are you doing here? Can't you see we're working? - Are you the "Butterfly"? - Yes, and I've no idea why they call me that. What do you want, young man? The 'mouse' from London sent me. I don't know any mouse. Think harder. You worked together in 1968. Who are you anyway? Did you hear about the stolen jewellery? One billion worth. I don't know anything about that. Go away. Boys. Tell him to beat it. Here's my address. If your contacts tip you off about any fence trying to buy jewellery... just call me. You better do it. Don't forget. What just happened? See, that's how you do the one-two combo. Is that packaging safe enough? It's completly safe. Could it be delivered to the wrong person? Each container has a number. Yours is 499, and is the same number written on your receipt. It's a piece of cherished furniture. Family heirloom, you know? Don't worry. It'll be safer than at home. Please sign here. So, you're Barney Holmes. From England. I quite like English people... Police, and many other things... What have you got? You really hurt my little chaps the other day. They bear you no grudge, but they'll throw a couple of fights. Is that enough? You're not being exactly generous. Look at you... What have you got? My friends in Amsterdam informed me via Paris. The lot will be sold soon. Where? What if I don't tell you? As you wish. Don't be brute. Geneva. Geneva. Ruffian. Your silence is an omen of bad news, Mr. Holmes. My poor heart can't stand it. Please tell me something. They didn't report the robbery for two days. Do you know what a blonde, green-eyed woman with one billion worth in jewellery can do? Many things, unfortunately. She can hide anywhere in the world. She can disassemble the jewels, carve them, and sell them. Please don't go on. I think you'd better abandon all hope, Mr. Stanley. I'm sorry. I've decided to return to London. There must be something that can be done about it. My father used to say: If you can't do useful things, at least try not to do useless things. But you still have something to do. First meeting with a buyer, The price has been already set. Demand small bills, dollars, and Swiss francs. Time: 2.30 a.m. Place: 'Banana Boulevard' at the park. Please Mr. Decker. Will I see you in person? You said this would be the last mission, but I'd like to continue working with you. I believe you must be a wonderful man... My share is still 60%. Transfer will be made to the usual account in Amsterdam. Over. Here's the report on that woman's daily activities in Geneva. She rented the No.8 small mansion. We found a prospective buyer. We arranged a first, non-biding contact. He's in the car waiting for you . Is there anything wrong? You look nervous. Aren't you? Why should I? Mr. Decker has everything planned. A man or a woman? A man. Young or old? Young, but... Everything will be fine. Don't fret. You have the goods? Yes, I do. - Plastic surgery? - I beg your pardon? Have the jewels been reshaped? No, no surgery whatsoever. I'm ready to pay the stated price. In cash. Small bills. Dollars and Swiss francs. I'll have to check the gems first. Do you like horse racing? Only when I bet and I win. Saturday at the racetrack. Covered grandstand. Gate C. Come alone. I always work alone. That's a shame. A stranger's voice in the dark is a mystery. You can never guess what kind of man he may be. I trust we'll have the chance to talk in the darkness again. You never know. What is the colour of your eyes? Blue. Can't you see? Covered grandstand. Gate C. Alone. Your feet are very small. You were starting to undress. - You can carry on. - I'm not in a hurry. Something has changed in you. You mean my back? Or my face? Your eyes have a different colour. They rest on Friday nights... But if you prefer my real ones... Just wonderful. Yes, I prefer these ones. How did you find me? When you came to see me with your husband, I hired a man to follow you. Were you suspecting anything? Right from the very first day. You must admit I helped you a lot. I locked up the jeweller so you could fly away. So kind of you. I should thank you for it. Or perhaps you need something else? Am I correct? Perhaps. How much, for instance? Do you know what I thought when I first saw you? It doesn't bother me either way. The jewels. They were so easy to find. What did you think when you first saw me? "I'd love this woman to get closer to me, put her arms around me... and kiss me". Is that so? Out of the blue? Yes, and I still feel that way. Do you realise you're in my hands now? Just a phone call to the police and... And now let's talk business. - I'm in your hands. - Not yet. I offer you 20%. Do you know what I thought the second time? 30%. I thought that it would be a shame if she'd just kiss me. I'd love to make love to her. 40%. That's the best I can do. Can I go on unzipping your dress? My dear, things are getting rough. This isn't turning out quite the way I had planned. I imagine you must be at the library, with your books now... She's so clueless. That gives me the courage to carry on. No hard sacrifice will bring me down. Whatever happens, I'll be there with you. I want to be taking care of you, always. My dear Terence, I think... I must stop writing now. It just struck me now ... yes. I've got something really important to do now. Goodbye, Terence. Goodbye. Why didn't he show up? Why? He's trying to confuse you. Jewels are like a delayed-action bomb. They become increasingly dangerous with every passing second. He wants you to lose control, so you will get rid of them carelessly. But we're not going to lose control. Did he strike you as a dangerous man? No man looks dangerous to me. - Not even me? - Well, you do look dangerous. How could you get in touch with him again? Don't worry. Mr. Decker will arrange everything. And how do you get in touch with that mysterious Mr. Decker? He always finds me. Messages, phone calls... - From Amsterdam? - Or Geneva, Paris, London... He travels greatly. What is the meaning of this lighter? A woman must give a present to her husband from time to time. Those initials and the cheque I signed made a big impression on poor Urrutia. You can keep it. I bought it for you. You could be Mr. Decker too. Why didn't you meet me at the racecourse? I actually was there and saw you. Your plaid dress was beautiful, but you didn't come alone. Why didn't you follow my instructions? Alright. I'll give you another chance. Tomorrow. 9am. Natural History Museum. As you can see, there are no witnesses at this hour... save for the skeletons. Did you bring the jewels? Here they are. These animals lived in a remarkable world. Have you noticed? No, not really. They are defeated, but they don't look humiliated. Not like you or me. What are we missing? We are the winners, but we are humiliated. By laws, norms, prejudice... ...rules. All of that, as a whole, is limiting our freedom. I wouldn't trade places with them. Last night I started thinking about how your voice would sound in the dark. I obsessed over it. I'm sorry. Say something. You must. Please... Did you bring the money? It sounds great. Do you remember my voice? - Close your eyes. - Please. Do as I tell you. Close your eyes. I can only keep this emerald. The other jewels are false. They're false. Completely false. Pig. He lied when he said he hadn't made any duplicates. I'm glad to see you again anyway. So are we, aren't we? While in Geneva we felt the urge to see you, so we left everything behind to meet you here. I knew that sooner or later you would discover that the jewels were fake, But I never thought you'd come to reproach me for it in person. I didn't count on you, Doctor. What made you wonder? Sheer chance. A little something. The lighter. Exactly. A wife never gives the same present twice. And then, I thought of cheating the person who was trying to cheat me. Did you get the insurance's payment already? What if we share it into equal parts? It wouldn't be fair. I would have to reshape them and they'd lose their value. I suggest 50% for me and 25% for both of you. Alright, profit is secondary among gentlemen. - That's fine. - Sounds good. Can you pour another one for me, please? You. What is he doing here? How did he get in? Simple. Care to explain it to her? What do you have to explain to me? This all looks unconvincing to me. This man is the Geneva fence. He told me the jewels were false. He's a policeman. Lieutenant Barney Holmes. Interpol. You're all under arrest, charged for defrauding an insurance company. You are a lieutenant? You're from the Interpol? He cheated me. He lied to me. What a fraud. He made me believe that... I guess you can prove such an accusation. Of course. You signed a statement claiming that there were no duplicate jewels. And then there's this. I know the exact place where you hid them. Is that enough evidence for you? One more drink? Teetotaller? There's no point in denying the evidence. He's been the smartest of the lot. That's what my father always said. I guess it would be useless to try and explain that it all was... ...like a game. There has been no wrongdoing of any kind. You'll have to convince Mr. Stanley about that. We're all civilised here. And needless to say, we're ready to pay for our mistakes. I'm also ready to pay. My father used to say: "You do the crime, you do the time". Anyway, my insurance will cover any risk. You have no scruples. You're all despicable. I knew you'd try to bribe me. And I knew I would accept, any... reasonable proposal. Four equal parts, for example? Hello, who's calling? What? It was the Police. They said there was a fire in a warehouse. Two boxes were burnt. And they found the stolen jewels in one of those boxes. Now I have to give the insurance money back. Are you leaving again? No, dear. But tomorrow... ...someone will come to visit us. Mr. Decker will come to visit you at 1 PM tomorrow. Which one of you is Decker? Please tell me. Me. I'm Decker. Terence. You can walk. I've always been able to. But two years ago, I got trapped into the repulsive world of finance. It almost choked me. I was tired. Exhausted. So I sat down. But, Terence... - You are Decker? - Of course I am. I sent you a telegram, signed as 'Desiree', to make sure you'd keep the appointment. A good bait can always be used for different fish. I must confess, that you're the most clumsy, inept and useless bunch I have ever known. You ruined a great deal. However, I think you have other merits, and if you obey my orders without question, I may give you another chance. I have the most... ...amazing idea. The Bank of Spain.
