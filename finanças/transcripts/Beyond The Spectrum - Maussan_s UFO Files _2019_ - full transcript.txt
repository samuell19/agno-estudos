- From humble beginnings to legendary award-winning journalist, Jaime Maussan has been trusted as the voice as the people in Mexico for more than 47 years. - In the mid-90s, Maussan brought the subject of UFO's to the spotlight. - Then I became the anchor, and finally the director of the show that was on the air until 1995. From then on, I became involved with something that I felt was very important, UFO's. I know many people think that they are not important, that they are an illusion or fantasy, but I realized that many people have cameras at the beginning of the 90s, and they were able to record the UFO's, and I thought that I had a chance with these evidences to change the way people think. - Maussan has received the United Nation's Global 500 Award, three times the National Prize of Journalism in Mexico, the Ondas Award for journalists in Spain. He was recognized at the capital in Washington, DC. Currently, he is presenting Third Millennium News from Monday to Friday at 10 p.m. on national television. This news has set the standard for audience records for the channel, A-Plus Amas, on several occasions. Tercer Milenio continues to be presented every Sunday on prime time, after 22 years of uninterrupted transmission on Mexican TV. - I was not gonna be a journalist. I was gonna be an administrative worker for my father. He had a company, and he wished that I was able to take care of his company, and I never thought that I wanted to be a journalist, because 50 years ago the journalists in Mexico were not very honest. They wanted money for everything they put on the TV or in the newspaper. My father was a rancher, he had bullfights, he was also impresario for big bullrings. He organized bullfights. Even my aunt was a bullfighter, then I was going to become one, but at the same time my father wanted me to take care of his business. But in the last day when I had to choose my major, a friend of mine came to me, and asked me what was gonna be my future, what kind of major I was going to choose? Business administration, something like that. And he said, "Oh that's boring." and I said, "Why?" "Because it's just numbers, you know, "in a closed place, with no windows, so on." And I said, "What are you going to study?" He said, "Journalism." And I said, "Oh, you're gonna be a corrupt man, "you're gonna take money from people." And he said, "No, journalism is to change the world. "Journalism is the possibility to create conscience. "Journalism is traveling, journalism is going into the open, "and reporting what you find." And I liked that. I immediately changed my major, probably the best decision I have done in my life. Then, I decided, but my father didn't like the idea, and at the same time he knew that the journalists in Mexico were corrupt. And I said to my father, "I will never, ever, father, take any money from anyone. "I'm gonna be a very clean and honest journalist." And I have kept that promise until now. I've been an honest man, all my life. And thanks to that, I've been able to develop credibility. When I was a young kid, I saw the destruction of nature, but I didn't know why I didn't like it. I knew that the animals were being killed, there was business doing with animals, that anybody could take an animal from their habitats, and sell it. When I found journalism, when I found my real passion for life, I really started to try to change my world. And I was able to do it in many ways, because I worked in television with the most important journalists of Mexico. Jacobo Zabludovsky, the Walter Cronkite of the US, a man that was very well known everywhere in Mexico, and I became very close to him, in many ways, his right hand, even though I was almost a teenager. When I did my first report, I took my report to Cannes, in France. I was just 19, and I received a scholarship from the US, from an American university, the University of Ohio. And I was able to finish my career then. When I came back I started working in journalism, to try to protect the environment, to try to protect the woods and the jungles. I was able to find the monarch butterfly in Mexico, their hidden places, where they hibernate. Fred Urquhart, Canadian scientist, he's the one who found it. I mean he's the one who really tracked the monarch butterfly, but when he published his article in National Geographic, he never said where it was. My network, Televisa, asked me, to go out and find the place. It took us two years to find it, but we finally did, and I was able to present for the first time to the Mexican people, the monarch butterfly, and I was able to get protection for the monarch butterfly. Then, working in 60 Minutes in Mexico as a reporter, I was able to get involved with the protection of the turtles. In Mexico we used to kill the turtles in slaughterhouses. And thanks to my reporting on 60 Minutes, they were closed, and we created laws to protect the turtles, and that's the reason why some of the species of turtles have now recuperated. Then, I was able to do many things to speak about the climate change, or the global warming, back in 1986. I was able to speak about the El Nino current in '87, or the depletion of the ozone layer in '88. We were just two journalists from all around the world, who went with NASA to the North Pole, to report if there was a hole in the North Pole, as the one that had been observed in the South Pole. They found that no, there was not a hole, it was a little bit depleted, but we didn't have the same problem, because the currents are different in both poles. Anyway, I was able to be there with a German journalist, and even the NASA people were amazed, they said, a reporter, a journalist from a tropical country is here. Why, the Americans, why, the Europeans, are not here? But I was very much involved in the protection of environment, and when I found that news, Televisa allowed me to go and participate with NASA, in this investigation back in January, 1988. And I was able to do many other things, like for example, to help the Tarahumaras in the Sierra in Mexico. They were dying of hunger and cold, also in '88, '87, and we were able to get thousands of funds of food for them, with a report on 60 Minutes in Mexico. Then I became the anchor, and finally the director of this show that was on the air until 1995. From then on, I became involved with something that I thought was very important, UFO's. I know many people think that they are not important, that they are an illusion or fantasy, but I realized that many people have cameras, at the beginning of the 90's, and they were able to record the UFO's. And I thought that I had a chance, with these evidences, to change the way people think. Back in 1991, there was a total solar eclipse in Mexico, probably the longest, or the second longest in the whole century, six minutes and 54 seconds. And people, many people in Mexico recorded the solar eclipse, but some people got UFO's, in the middle of the videos, and I thought that was very important. - I was invited to this program because I had done a report on 60 Minutes about Billy Meier, and people identified me, but as a matter of fact, I didn't want to go to this television show, because I thought that UFO's were not good for journalists, that they were very risky, and I shouldn't get involved with this. But my company, my network, I don't need to go to this show. And it was so successful they asked me to go for a second time, and I didn't want to go. I really didn't want to go. I said, "That's it, no more UFO's please." But this man insisted. "Please, this is the last time. "Let's do another show, "because you know how many people saw this, "millions and millions and millions of people, "and I want to do a new one." And I say okay, but this is the last one. This is really the last show. And I went there and I was able to find these videos, that were recorded by some people of the eclipse, where they found UFO's. When I presented this, very early in the morning, probably three of four o'clock in the morning, it was a revolution. Thousands of people came to the television. At five o'clock in the morning there were more than five or 10 thousand people outside the station, because they wanted to get in, because they were so excited with these videos, and after that show, nothing was the same for me in my life. I received many invitations from different universities in Mexico, then I received invitations from international congresses around the world, and I couldn't get away. I couldn't get away anymore. Then I started, even without, even thinking to get so much involved, because people send me videos. I have hundreds of videos of UFO's. And then I realized that this was very important, this was a new phenomenon, a phenomenon inside a phenomenon, where people were recording these things with cameras, because everybody had a camera now. Or many people had a camera, VHS, back in '90-'91. And I thought with the development of technology, more and more and more people are gonna have cameras. And then I said, "Well, "I am very sure in the future, "everyone is gonna have a camera, "and we will be able to have "many more videos, many more evidences." And I started to promote people to watch the sky, when they have time to watch the sky, and record whatever was there. I never thought this was gonna be successful, but then I received one video recorded by one person, and then another, and another, and another, and then dozens, and then hundreds, and then I didn't know what to do with so much evidence I had. And 1995 ended 60 Minutes, and I received more and more invitations to present conferences. And I went all around Mexico, and I mean all around Mexico, presenting all the evidences, with full theaters, and I'm talking a thousand people, two thousand people, everywhere. And I couldn't escape anymore, and then I became the center of this phenomenon in Mexico. In 1997, I started that show, Tercer Milenio, on Televisa, that lasted until 2003, then went out of the air. - Tercer Milenio. - That Televisa is a huge network, the national network in Mexico, asked me to come back and present Tercer Milenio in 2004. And I did it, and I have, I've been on the air since 2004 until now. Very successful show. Now it's running in a different network, also a national network, Azteca. And we have even growing in numbers, in ratings. Around two million people watch the show every week, which should probably be considered the most successful show on UFO's around the world. - UFO's have been the stuff of conspiracy theorists for decades, often mocked for talking about it, but maybe they shouldn't be mocked. Commander David Fravor spent 18 years as naval aviator or pilot. In 2004 he had an unforgettable encounter with an aircraft he said was defying the laws of physics. Well Commander Fravor joins us tonight. Thanks a lot for coming on tonight. Tell us what you saw. - We had launched on a routine training mission. When we joined up we were told that the event was gonna be canceled, and that we have real-world tasking, and we were sent out to the west. Now take in mind that this is taking place about a hundred miles southwest of San Diego, between San Diego and Ensenada, Mexico, on a clear, perfect day, blue waters. We get out to the spot where they tell us it's at. We start looking around, and both of us, both airplanes see a disturbance in the water, and white, 40-foot long, Tic Tac-shaped object, just hovering above the water, going forward, back, left, right. There's no rotor wash, there's no wings, nothing. So as we drive around in a clockwise flow, we get to about the nine o'clock position, and I said, well I'm gonna go down and check it out, and the other jet is gonna stay high. So as we go down and when we get to the 12 o'clock position, it starts to mirror us. So it's in a clockwise flow and it's on the opposite side of the circle from us, and we continue this. It's in a climb, we're in a descent. We're getting a great look at it, this whole thing takes about probably up to five minutes from the time we show up. I get over to the eight o'clock position, it's at about the two o'clock position, and I decide I'm gonna go and see what it is, and it's about 2,000 feet below me, and I cut across the circle, and as I get within about a half-mile of it, it rapidly accelerates to the south in about two seconds and disappears. - What would you estimate the speed? - Well above supersonic. It, like a bullet out of a gun, it took off. - So from what you know about aerodynamics, mechanics, physics, should this be possible, what you saw? - Not with the technology that we have today, not at all. - Even now, even 13 years later, is there anything that you know of, capable of this kind of behavior? - No, there's nothing I know of. When we saw the video with the IR, it has no exhaust, no discernible things of any form of propulsion, and this thing came from a dead hover over the water, just kind of moving around to a climb up to about 12,000 feet, to rapidly accelerating away in a climb, and in less than two seconds it was gone. And you figure, you're talking 50 miles of visibility, and you can easily see an object that size, easily after 10 miles, and it just disappeared in seconds. - What would be the effects on a human pilot, the G forces involved in that altitude change? - Well the altitude wouldn't be bad, it would be the acceleration of the object. - Right. - Honestly, I wanted to fly it. You know talking to some physicists, they don't think the human body could handle that kind of force with that acceleration. - Yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't sound like the human body could. So bottom line, what do you think this was? - I believe as do the other folks that were on the flight when we visually saw it, that it was something not from this world. - Presumably you expressed that belief to your superiors, what did they say? - Actually we caught a lot of grief getting back to the boat, and it got passed off as an event that no one could explain. Now keep in mind, they had been tracking these for two weeks prior to us seeing it, and this was the first time that manned airplanes had been airborne when the objects appeared. - This feels like a really big story to me, it's not exactly clear why Vladimir Putin's more interesting than this. I think this seems like a big deal, and Commander, I appreciate your taking the time to talk do us about it. - Back in 2004, the Secretary of Defense in Mexico called me to deliver a video to me. They recorded this video on March the 5th, 2004. It goes to the Campeche area, but the plane was in the middle of the jungle. They were able to record these lights, following the airplane. There were 11 lights following the airplane. The Mexican scientist went to the television to say, that they were, how you say, lightning, or energy in the air, ball lightning. 11 ball lightning, following and surrounding an airplane. They went to the Secretary of Defense later and said, oh we are sorry, oh we were wrong, sorry. But they had never said that publicly, you see? But they know they were wrong, because the Secretary of Defense wouldn't deliver a video of UFO's, if he knew it was something else. Then I can tell you, that proves that in Mexico even the authorities are ready to accept this. The only reason we don't do it, is because we don't want to confront the US. We don't want to confront the scientists from the US, because they would make fun of the Mexican government, and they would make jokes about that, and nobody's ready for that. - I received a call from the Secretary of the Secretary of Defense in Mexico. He asked me to come. I had an appointment, I went there, I sit down in an office, nobody was there. When I realized I was in the drug traffic, from the administration from the military, and I said, Jesus Christ, what happened? Did somebody say that I did something? What I'm doing here? I have to go, I have to go. This is no good. And then they came and said, Mister Maussan, can you come with us please? And I says, Jesus Christ, what is gonna happen now? And they took me to a little theater, and they put the video, and they all said, "Can you explain this please?" And I saw it, and I said, "Jesus, are these things following the airplane?" "Yes, and they surrounded the airplane." "Can I talk to the pilot?" "No, first tell us what you think." And I said, "Well, I think they are UFO's." The video had been recorded with a FLIR camera. This camera was in 2004, just for the military. It was a very specialized camera, that could track the infrared, and could track the heat in the airplane. They were using this camera in this airplane because they were looking for narcotics from, drugs from South America, and they were in the area where is the shortest in Mexico, from coast to coast, and the airplanes had to go through there, and it was fairly easy to track these drug dealers. And they used this as special equipment. And the military, saw these lights. They couldn't see the lights with their eyes. They just saw it with the camera, but they knew, they had a screen, in the airplane and they were looking at the screen, even though they couldn't find it in the air, in the atmosphere. It was in the camera, and they got very nervous, especially when they were surrounded by these lights. The captain turn off the navigation lights, because he thought he was gonna be confronted, by these UFO's. Then some people came, and tried to explain that video, saying that they were oil rigs. - Letting off fire? - Exactly, and some other things, missiles, and so many really crazy things. But the military were there every day, for many hours, in the same place, and they never saw something like this, and they couldn't explain it. When I told them that these were UFO's, they said, "Okay, thank you very much Mister Maussan." And I left, they didn't tell me anything else. I received a call again, a couple of days later, and they say, the Secretary of Defense wants to see you personally, in his office. I went there, and he asked me, "What do you think they are?" And I said, "UFO's. "Can I talk to the crew?" "You will, you will. "You are gonna be the only one who is gonna do that. "I'm gonna give you the tape, "you can do whatever you want. "Just remember that you have the honor and the pride "of the Armed Forces of Mexico in your hands. "Be very careful." - "If somebody asks you who gave you this video..." I thought, oh he's gonna say, you don't know who gave you this. "...you are gonna say, "that the Secretary of Defense gave you this video." And I said, Jesus Christ. My pants almost fell down. I have this evidence, they have given me this evidence, and the Secretary of Defense of Mexico was supporting me, whatever I did with this. I felt a big responsibility. I investigated everything I could with this tape. I had a chance to interview all the crew, the captain, and the cameraman, and everyone that was inside the plane, and all of them told me, this is real, we've never seen anything like this. And then I presented this video in a national television program in Mexico, in the newscast, in the most important newscast, on May the 9th, or the 10th, of 2004. The next day I gave a press conference, and all the international media came to the press conference. I gave them this video, and next night, or that night, it was everywhere around the world, in every single newscast. I don't think there is a sighting of UFO's, that has been presented everywhere like this happened in 2004. And then I thought that I had done my job the best I could. I never expected the explanations that were going to be given to this video, incredible video, were gonna be so stupid as they were. - After I learned that there were UFO's that were invisible to the eye, I proposed that idea on television, and Pedro Avila, a UFO hunter, who cannot walk, he's in a chair, he's looking through his window all day long, built a device, to put two cameras, one infrared and one normal spectrum, and he was able, it's the only time that this has every been done everywhere where you have camera recording in the normal spectrum, and the other camera in the infrared, and you can see these objects in the infrared, and you cannot really see anything in the normal spectrum, proving that there are UFO's that are not visible to the eye, to the sight. And I think that was very important. From then one, more and more people and with the development of technology, even the FLIR technology now, available to many people, to almost anyone, who wants to have a FLIR camera, now you can have it. And now many people are recording these invisible UFO's, everywhere, and it is just amazing. And we are proving now that what was said 15 years ago, with the military in Mexico, is happening in many, many places, right now. - Jaime Maussan has a multi-faceted story, that spans the over-arcing theme of ET visitation. He has coordinated the investigation of the tridactylus beings in Peru, and that could become the most important finding that has been made on the theme. His story will continue, and so will "Beyond the Spectrum."
