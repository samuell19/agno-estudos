DEBAUCHERY Here. Starring Ryoko Watanabe Serina Nishikawa Mizuho Nakagawa Yuka Hanabusa Yuka Takemura Written and Directed by Hidehiro Ito Your husband is here. Honey! You're really good. How long have you been here? Just a little while. - So, how is she coming along? - Hello. Pretty soon, I won't be able to keep up with her. Excessive flattery is part of his mindset. I think he's convinced that women are too vain. We're going to grab something to eat. Care to join us? Thanks, but no. I see. Well, see you later. See you! You don't like him very much, do you? I hate how his eyes are always on me. Was he like that even back when you were a nurse? You're a talented surgeon, and he's your old friend. Still, he was the one who brought us together. I don't mean to speak too badly of him. Maybe he was actually in love with you. Don't be silly. Wait here. I'll go get changed. Here. I'll be late tonight. Why don't you eat dinner without me? Actually, honey, I already have plans with Mizuho for tonight. Oh, you do? That’s perfect. Have a relaxing night out. You're so lucky. You landed yourself such a great husband. You know, I want to hurry up and leave this angel in white nurse job behind... ...and slip into a pink negligee instead... ...and really start turning on the charm. Oh, you don't say? You sure seem horny these days, Mizuho. I knew it. You can tell? The thing is... I'm in love with someone. With who? He should be here any time now. You were late, so... I called him. Dr. Kohsaka... Don't be mad. If I hadn't, I'd never have a chance to see him outside of work. He doesn't return your feelings, does he? I don't stand a chance with him, anyway. Instead of being so stingy with my goods all the time, maybe I should try selling 'em to everyone like that girl does. What girl? Remember that girl Sachiko, she was two years behind us? They say she works at a prostitution club these days. We're living in an age when young housewives work in brothels. It’s a marketplace where the clients ask how much for that woman's body. Of course, there's a difference between high-grade and ordinary grades of meat. If you like, I can tell you where to find that club. Doctor! Why didn't you speak up sooner? You scared me half to death! I'm so embarrassed... I feel like someone just caught me naked. So, you enjoy buying women, Doctor? Ami! I've only gone there once. The Madam Machiko Society Club in Aoyama. There are even happy wives there who are just like you. They get off on the thrill of it. The thrill of being bought by some man they've never met. It’s the joy of the illicit. Hello? This is the lady of the house? Time, 2PM today. Place, Central Park in Harajuku. Your client will be wearing a striped suit and sunglasses. He will be holding a copy of Focus magazine. Goodbye. Hello? Could you please page Dr. Fujina at the Psychology Laboratory? Honey? If it’s possible, I'd like to see you right away. No, nothing's wrong. I just wanted to see you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you. Yes. You're right. I understand. What kept you? You're more than 30 minutes late. I just put in a call to complain. - No! - Like hell! No! There are even happy wives there who are just like you. They get off on the thrill of it. It’s the thrill of the illicit. And you are? Come right in. You want to work here? I don't know who told you about us, but you do know what sort of work that entails, I take it? I see. So, what are your conditions? Only in the afternoon. And only one or two times per week. I'm sure you have your reasons. I don't employ girls who don't intend to stick with it. Of course, we've had some girls who started out reluctant, but then became addicted to it and started working every day. In any case, I think a woman of your caliber will have fine partners. You'll be spending time with all sorts of clients, so you should enjoy yourself. Come here. You want to enjoy yourself, too, don't you? Your body is throbbing, isn't it? Just as I thought. It’s your queen that’s attacking the enemy, which draws out the knight. And before he knows it, he finds himself in too deep and is trapped. I never beat you at chess anymore. You were too good a teacher. I'm going to turn in. It’s so good to see you. We haven't seen you lately. We've been waiting for you. A partner has arrived for you. Come out and say hello. Hello. Be my guest. She's only joined us just recently. I'm not certain that she'll be to your liking. I'll know for sure once I try her out. She'll never make it. Making her take a client like him will drive her crazy. Leave her be. That girl is starving. She's wishing for something extreme. Hands off! You're the one who needs to undress. Not the top. Take off your panties. Sit on the sofa. Bend your knees and spread your legs. Play with yourself. Dig in there with your fingers. Rub where you're most sensitive. Bitch! You poor thing, getting an animal like him your first time... I thought that he might break you. I never felt like that before. It was like I was about to be torn in half. Don't. Does your life with him satisfy you? I see that your blood is boiling, making your body tingle in new, strange ways. Someday, you will belong to me. I'll make you my plaything. Look at those two go at it. Why don't you dance with her? I'm not sure. She's changed. I guess you could say she has a strange allure to her. She almost seems like a different person sometimes, doesn't she? It’s subtle, but a woman like me can spot these things. To an angel like you, I bet it makes you jealous, huh? Am I right? While you're not looking, Ami keeps getting prettier and prettier. How does that feel... Excuse me. You tested me. To see if I was a woman who could be charmed by him. But you didn't give in to him. I don't understand you sometimes. Even though we're so close. You seem awfully uninterested in me sometimes. Don't give up on me. I love you. You're the only one for me. I'm so happy... I have an academic conference in Kyoto two days from now. Could you buy the ticket for me? Would it be all right if I went with you? I want to be with you. It’s all right, isn't it? I promise that I won't get in your way. All right. But on one condition. Let me kiss your breasts. Right now? Out here? My goodness, it’s you. I thought we might not see you again. Please, come right in. You're just in time. A client is here who is dying to meet you. Once you're done changing, go straight into the room. What’s the matter? Having me as a client doesn't sit well with you? Why are you... What are you doing here? If you're going to say that, you'll have to explain what YOU are doing here, too. You knew, didn't you? You knew I came here. You came here so you could see me and gloat! I'd be lying if I said I didn't know. You've finally begun to become aware of your desires. Your body and soul were awakened by extreme acts, acts that his kindness can't satisfy. I've been watching you all this time. That’s vile... Cowardly! Telling me about this place was part of your plan, wasn't it? You wanted to shame me... To hold me up for ridicule! Yes. Exactly. Because you hated me more than anything else. As if I would pass up the chance to conquer you. Fine. You want to enjoy yourself with me, right? I'm your whore. Use me however you want. I intend to do just that. But ordinary ways would be boring. I'll use the means that suit you best... ...to get your body acquainted with me. Lick her. Use your tongue to make this woman cry out in pleasure like a madwoman. Stop... Ami. I'll be heading into Tokyo straight from the university tomorrow. Care to join me for tea at the station? Sure. Hello? Kohsaka? Yes, that’s right. It’ll be for about three days. That material I lent you the other day, can you return it after I get back? Yeah. To Ami? Sure. Just a minute. It’s Kohsaka. He says he needs to tell you something. Yes? All right. I understand. What do you think? A fairly devious scheme, isn't it? This is where you lived with Mizuho until you got married. She's been living here alone ever since you left. Don't worry. She's on vacation, visiting her parents. You crawled your way out of here. Given your background, I thought this would give this a fitting atmosphere. Can you really kill me? You know what a hemorrhage is, right? Don't... A man will pump out a massive amount of blood until he dies. Stay away! Enough to cover this whole apartment in blood! Stay back! What are you going to do with that knife? I'm starving, pops. Did you bring me anything? You want to be punished. Punishment that will make you writhe in pain. Will you endure it? I won't lock the door. There's no telling who might come in and see you. Wait! No... What are you doing, pops? You aren't jerking off, are you? I want you to do my toenails. Can you do that? Ow! Bastard! What are you doing? I'm sorry! My hand slipped! Why would it slip? You were staring at my crotch, right? You were spacing out. You're that interested in what’s down here? I'll show you. I'll give you a good whiff of it, too! It must feel great for a filthy old bachelor like you to have the company... ...of a sweet young thing like me! Crawl. Get on all fours and walk like a dog. No! No! Whatever you doing? Let me go! I dreamed of being whipped by that man... I wanted him to do horrible things to me. I wanted to do such unspeakable things... Darling... Forgive me. You don't need to go anywhere anymore. I'll treat you exactly how you want. - I'll punish you like a slave. - No... Ami! The End
