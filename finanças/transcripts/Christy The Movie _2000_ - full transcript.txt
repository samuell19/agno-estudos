Are you alright, Mother? Fine. Oww. Can't drive no closer, ladies. You'll have to walk the rest. Thank you, Mr. Franklin. [ Giggling ] Mother, what's so funny? [ Sighing ] It feels like home. [ Giggling ] I can hardly believe my eyes. Does it seem very different? Oh, David would have a fit if he saw what a sorry state it was in. He built the mission house with his own hands, you know. He and Alice. Ohh.... Alice Henderson.... After all these years I can still see her standing on the porch confronting Birdseye Taylor and the moonshiners with a shotgun. Shotgun? [ Chuckling ] She was a Quaker missionary! She was that and more. She was the glue that held this place together. A source of strength and conviction when we all needed them. And it was Alice Henderson who recruited me to come here and teach. [ Christy: ] Life in the Great Smokies of 1912 was not like anywhere else. Certainly not the city of Asheville, North Carolina, where I was raised. Tall-tales, gossip and superstition dominated everyone, as the threads of many traditions were woven into the fabric of their simple, harsh lives. But there was also intense loyalty and faith among the families. It took me a long time to appreciate how enriching those qualities could be... ...and that a privileged upbringing was not required to possess them. [ Indistinct Chatter ] At the mission, we tried to bring spiritual comfort to people's lives wherever possible, but there were practical goals as well, like building a useable road to connect us to the outside world. But sometimes there were obstacles to those efforts. The crime spree that hit the families that year was particularly difficult. David, Jeb, hello!! Miss Christy. What are you doing way out here? I felt like taking a ride. It's such a beautiful day, isn't it? That isn't exactly the word I'd use to describe it. David, what's wrong? Take a look around. My entire crew's disappeared, that's what. After three weeks, it's back to just Jeb and me. I don't understand... Where did everyone go? Somebody's milk cows ran off and they all went looking for them. So much for road building. The families are nervous about the robberies, David, but that doesn't mean the men won't be back. Don't be too sure about that. Some of them were already suspicious about what we're doing out here, isn't that right, Jeb? I'm afraid that's true. Suspicious? Sure, haven't you heard? Outsiders will use this road to invade Cutter Gap and steal everything that's not nailed down. But a road will make life so much better for everyone. And I've heard nothing but grumbling ever since someone ran off with the O'Teale's rooster last week. According to our neighbors, outsiders are the root of all evil, Christy, and hese robberies are the only proof they need. I'm sorry you're having such a bad time of it... I guess this isn't the best time to ask for a favor. So it wasn't just a beautiful day that brought you out here after all. Not entirely. I was wondering if you'd consider helping Zach prepare for his exam. If he can swing an axe, I'll tutor him all he wants. I meant at the mission, in the evenings. Christy, I barely have time to prepare my sermon during the week. Besides, you don't need my help. You've done wonders with Zach. But he needs more. He's far behind where he should be for college. I don't think I can do it. But he wants to be a doctor so badly. And I want this road finished. I'm sorry. [ Christy: ] When David turned me down, I became more determined than ever to help Zach pursue his dream. Achieving it would be another matter. Who formulated the fundamentals of geometry? I don't remember, Miss Christy. Euclid. Euclid...right. Who formulated the basic laws of gravity and motion? N-Newton? Correct. And who showed that the Earth revolves around the sun? Umm, I don't-- I don't know. Sure you do. It starts with a "C". C-Copernicus. Very good, Zach. Right pretty gal. It's a pity she don't know me yet. I don't know, teacher. I ain't--I ain't never gonna be like the doc. He knows practically everything. He didn't always. A long time ago, he was a boy just like you growing up... Mr. Holt, good morning! My boy left before his work was done. I'm sorry, Pa. Go tend to your chores, boy. Yes, sir. Mr. Holt, I apologize for asking Zach to come to school early this morning. Problem is, them poachers made off with my tools last night. I'm so sorry. We'll get by. But that boy of mine needs to be at home working, not off somewhere with his nose in a book. I have a good mind to put an end to all this. Please, don't do that. Zach is a very special student. He has a wonderful future ahead of him! Future... Yes. He wants to be a doctor so much. Do you think he's got it in him to be like Doc MacNeill? Why don't we let Vanderbilt College give us the answer to that. This is a letter from the Dean. Because we're so far away, they're giving permission for Zach to take the entrance examination right here. Where exactly is that... Vanderbilt? Nashville. Don't worry, Mr. Holt. Zach is going to do very well. I'm sure of it. Alright, you! Come on down from that horse, and you won't get hurt! My name is Alice Henderson. I'm traveling to the mission at Cutter Gap. Thee wouldn't steal from a Christian woman, would thee. Don't trouble me none. Boo! [ Horse Whinnies ] Now you done it! Come on! Miss Christy. When's Miss Alice getting back for Cataleechie? I don't know, Fairlight. There were two women near term. Why? Well, it don't set right with Jeb me bein' gone all day and them poachers around. He wants me looking after the cabin when he's out. Fairlight, don't give it a second thought. We'll survive. You won't if you let Ruby Mae in the kitchen. I swear, that girl can't fix a kettle of water! You go take care of your family. Thank you, Miss Christy. [ Indistinct Chatter ] Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for being patient. There seems to be quite a bit of interest in the road that Reverend Grantland is building. Can anyone tell me what the new road will bring? More thievin' outlanders. Not exactly. Anyone else? It's called progress. That's what happens when people get something to make their life better. Won't be nothing left if them outlaw poachers get their way. My daddy says ain't nothing good that's come from outside the cove. I'm sure he didn't mean that, Creed. After all, I came from the outside, and so did Miss Henderson and Mr. Grantland. We're not so bad, are we? Hmm, reckon not. And Zach is hoping to attend college all the way across the state in Nashville. [ Oohs and Aahs ] People from the outside and progress coming here are different things. And progress isn't anything to be feared. In fact, it's exciting, like the new Woolworth Building in New York City. It's the tallest in the world... 60 stories high! Can you imagine a building as tall as a mountain? But teacher, we already got us mountains. You certainly do. Here's another-- next year the Panama Canal will finally make a waterway from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. We got those too-- Turkey Trot Creek and cold Springs Branch. But here's one thing you don't have-- instead of an outhouse, how would each of you like to have your own inside toilet on freezing winter nights? You mean outlanders got privies right in their cabin?! In most cities they do. And there's are all sorts of modern conveniences like that beyond these mountains. Some day they'll be right here in Cutter Gap. [ Airplane ] [ Boy: ] By the window... [ Indistinct Chatter ] Look...over there! [ Engine Sputtering ] [ Indistinct Chatter ] I take it this isn't the Knoxville Airfield. This here's Cutter Gap. Tennessee? Where else'd it be? We're 70 miles east of Knoxville. My name's Harriet-- Harriet Quimby. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Christy Huddleston, and these curios creatures are my school children. They've never seen an airplane. Miss Quimby, you're hurt! I'll be fine. I've survived worse crashes. You'd better get Doctor MacNeill. Yes, ma'am. [ Christy: ] By the time Doctor MacNeill arrived, word of the airplane had spread. People came from as far away as Lufty Branch and Lonesome Pine Ridge to see for themselves. [ Indistinct Chatter ] [ Christy: ] But it wasn't so much the machine as the woman who brought it that became the main attraction. Well, what do we have here? Doctor MacNeill, meet Miss Harriet Quimby. Miss Quimby. Doctor. This may hurt a wee bit, but I'll be as careful as I can. Christy has complete faith in you, so I'll trust her judgment. Well, I'd better do my best work then. Yes, you had. Now, by using small stitches, the scar will be more difficult to see. So, it ain't that bad. Fortunately for Miss Quimby, no. If you don't mind me asking, what in blazes was a woman like you doing risking her neck? I'm not sure, doctor... What kind of woman am I? I meant no offense... Only that flying is a dangerous enterprise... ...Better left to men. Better left to birds and insects. Doctor MacNeill, you are going to be amazed by the adventures that Miss Quimby has been sharing with us. Last month Harriet became the first woman to fly the English Channel alone. Was that by design or would no one fly with you. Miss Quimby, I hope you'll come speak to the school children. I've been telling them all about the modern era, and your travels would be so educational. Well, I'll have plenty of time. Somehow I need to get a propeller from Knoxville. Well, I'd be pleased to lend you a hand-up, miss. I can get over to Knoxville in no time. Thank you, Mister...? Perkins. Josh Perkins. And I'm, uh, I'm pretty fair with my tools if you show me what to do with that gyro-gismo. Well, I can help Mister McHone... [ Christy: ] No, Zach... You have studying to do. Yes--yes, ma'am. Zach is preparing for his entrance exam to Vanderbilt. He's going to be Cutter Gap's very next physician. [ Harriet: ] Thank you for offering, Zach. Thank you all. Oh, shucks, think nothing of it. I hope that flying machine don't take long to fix. You ever see such wearin' clothes? Frightful. More like bark on a tree. This is a nice view there. Zacharias, you got chores waitin'! But my lesson with teacher. Never mind! You like a lump of sugar in your lemonade? Doctor MacNeill... May I have a word with you? You may have several, Miss Huddleston. No additional charge. Zach seems to be doing quite well as your assistant. Well, he's fine for a boy with no training. He's enthusiastic about medicine and dedicated, don't you think? Christy, why do I get the feeling you're about to sell me something? Because I am. I was wondering if you would consider reviewing Zach's science studies with him this week. But I'm already devoting more time to his studies than I bargained for. Can't Grantland do this? He turned me down. Did he... And with the test only days away, I don't know how I'll ever get Zach ready. It would mean so much to me. Then by all means, count me in. [ Indistinct Chatter ] [ Squeaking Wheels ] Alright, easy, gentlemen. Harriet, now you let us do that! You rest up! Thank you, Tom, but I think I'll be fine. Oh, now, you'll never be able to fly this thing till you rest up. Alright. Can't be too careful. Watch the other end. It's hard to imagine a big machine like this being able to soar through the sky, isn't it, children? But it can't. Of course it can, Sam Houston. You saw it land. No, ma'am. We seen it fall... on account of it can't fly. [ Ruby Mae: ] Miss Harriet... Hmm? What's it like up yonder? Oh, that's hard to describe, Ruby Mae. When you're flying, your senses are alive in a way they're not on the ground. It's a whole different world. Does anyone know what a person who flies an airplane is called? A bird-lady? An aviator. And since the Wright Brothers made their flight at Kitty Hawk nine years ago, more and more people have learned to fly. Miss Harriet, while you're up in the sky, have you ever seen Santa? As a matter of fact, I have. And since we're fellow aviators, Santa and I have become good friends. Can you tell him Little Burl says, "Howdy?" Oh, I'd be happy to. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Christy: ] Doctor MacNeill, what's wrong with her? Whoa! Whoa, now! [ Child: ] Why is she all bent over like that? Let me help, doc. What's happened? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What happened?! She was thrown from her horse. Let's take her upstairs. Alright, be careful now. Easy...easy. Poor Miss Alice! We'll wait downstairs. I'll stay here to help Doctor MacNeill. She awake? Some men tried to steal her horse. The poachers? Worse than that. They could have killed her. Thankfully, the Lord was watching over her. Or the thieves simply bungled the job. Maybe God helped them bungle it. Or maybe Alice is simply a very lucky woman! Either way, I'll look in on her tomorrow. Would you mind walking Zach home? He came to study, and under the circumstances I wouldn't feel right sending him out there alone. I'll do better than that. I'll work with him a bit when we get there. You'll stick to science, I hope... And leave theological discussions to someone else. I'll try to control myself. [ Knocking ] Yes? How are you feeling? Embarrassed. Whatever for? I was too tired to travel safely. If I'd had my wits about me, those men would not have surprised me. Well, you're back with us now, and that's all that matters. Have you had a chance to speak with our guest? Briefly. Harriet is a remarkable woman-- so accomplished and modern. Wait until you hear about her life. Christy, there is something that I must talk to you about. I saw Doctor Ferrand during my stay. He asked me to say that if thee should decide to continue teaching, he can only offer you a reduction in the compensation. Did he happen to mention how much of a reduction? One-half of thy salary. I see... You better get some rest. A reduction in salary after all you've accomplished here? I can't believe that even an old goat like Ferrand would... David! I can't help it. You shouldn't talk like that. I'm sorry, but I haven't been this angry in a long time. Tell me what I can do to make this right. I don't think there's anything you can do. Sure there is. I can go telephone him right now and tell him what a fine teacher you are! He's seen me teach, David. He knows all that he needs to. Then how could he propose something so grossly unfair? Maybe that's the point. Maybe he wants me to leave. That's ridiculous. Is it? The school at Raven Gap is closing. Soon Doctor Ferrand will have one too many teachers. That can't be his motive. No one could ever replace you. Under the circumstances, I don't think I have any choice. Yes, you have. Marry me. You won't have to worry about leaving here. What? And money won't be a problem. [ Voices Outside: ] Come on, boys, let's try the mission house. There they are. Ault, wh-what's going on? Spencer got hit by them poachers. They made off with our wagon. Is Fairlight alright? She blames herself, Miss Christy. They stole it while she was out huntin' berries with the young 'uns. That makes five families... ...And Miss Henderson. Search party's gettin' together over to Holcombe's. We aim to run them outsiders down once and forever... ...If'n they don't get away on that road of yours first. That road had nothing to do with this, Ault. Come on, we best be getting to Holcombe's. There ain't no telling when them fellas will show up again. You folks-- be watchful. Thank you, Tom, we will. I'd be grateful if Fairlight and the young 'uns could stay down at the mission house while I'm gone. Of course they can, Jeb. Your family's welcome anytime. I appreciate it. I should go with them. David, why? You know Ault. This might be my only chance to prevent a lynching. Please be careful. I better get going. Whoa. So Harriet, how goes the repairs? Oh--slowly, I'm afraid. My helpers left to join a search party. I hope I haven't come at a bad time. Oh no, not at all. It's flying I love, not wallowing in grease. Then you might be of a mind to escape from it. Just give me an excuse. Well, how does a personal tour of Cutter Gap sound? I've even packed a picnic lunch, if you care to brave my cooking. How brave do I have to be? Not very. Coincidentally, a physician will be close at hand throughout the meal. Well, then I gladly accept. [ Christy: ] Doctor MacNeill, what brings you out so early? I just came by to check in on Alice. How is she getting along? She's already defying your orders to stay in bed. That's a good sign. I'm also going to show Harriet what the cove looks like from the ground. You're welcome to come along, of course. Thank you, but as you know, I have school to teach. Well, it isn't anything you haven't seen before. Well, I'll, uh, go clean up. Well, take your time. I've still got a patient to see. It's so thoughtful of you to show Harriet around. Ah, it's the least I could do. Well, a woman can't be expected to work on a plane all the time. No, of course not. [ Christy: ] Good morning, class. [Christy, reflecting ] I tried to concentrate on teaching, but it was impossible. [ Kids Talking ] [ Yelling ] Quiet! [ Christy: ] Seeing Miss Alice that morning had only reminded me of my uncertain future at the mission school. I couldn't help but wonder why she hadn't defended me against Doctor Ferrand's salary cut. But something else was on my mind, as well. Although I didn't want to admit it, I was also distracted by knowing where Neill was that day, and who he was with. It seemed as if everything in my life was being turned upside down. [ Kids Yelling ] Fight! Fight! Fight! Boys, stop it! I said STOP! You know how I feel about fighting! Well, he started it! I was just walking and all of a sudden--BANG! Right in the eye. Creed, is that what happened? No, ma'am. I didn't start this here knock-fight. Well, Lundy? I already said what happened. So you expect me to believe that a boy half your size just decided to hit you for no reason?! Lundy Taylor, you tell the truth! Why don't you mind your own business. What did you say? Everyone in the cove knows them no good poachers are robbing folks on account of your meddling. Alright, the first thing we're gonna do is hear an apology from Lundy. My pa says never be sorry for being truthful. But I am not responsible for the robberies in Cutter Gap. You know that! My pa says you are. It was your idea for preacher to build that there road. And momma says you don't like the cove. That's why you keep wanting to change it. They been saying things were better off before you brung your citified ideas. [ Children Agreeing ] [ Indistinct Chatter ] Remember to stay in groups on the way home! Miss Huddleston? Mister Holt! How nice to see you again. Zach, we missed you in school today. I wanted to come, teacher, but I couldn't. Is something wrong? I'll just say it straight out-- I don't want my boy goin' off to college. But Zach is such a special student! The way some folks tell it, you're filling his head with a lot of foolishness! My mind's made up. [ Harriet: ] It must be a challenging life. Forgive my curiosity, Neill, but how is it you're not married? I was once. She passed away. I'm sorry. Ah, it's behind me now. What about you? Never married. Never even came close. Might I ask how that could be possible? Men want tradition-minded wives who are content to stay at home and raise children. Having one who heads for the clouds at every opportunity isn't terribly desirable. Oh, I have my doubts about that. Well, then I'm a better pilot than I am a judge of men. Do you want to know my theory? I don't see that I have a choice. You are my guide back to the mission. These men--they're afraid they can't keep up with you. An independent woman can be as intimidating as a beautiful one. And you happen to be both. You don't seem intimidated. Fairlight... ...Can I talk to you? I got chores to finish, Miss Christy. And what with Jeb being so busy, my babies need me. I won't keep you long. The children said some hurtful things about me today in class. And they claim that their parents feel the same. Now, I wouldn't fret on that. You know how young 'uns are. This was different, Fairlight. Ozias Holt said that he won't let Zach go to college, and he left little doubt that I'm the reason. Now, Miss Christy, I wouldn't have no idea about that. Please--you're the only one I can count on. This mountain is the same now as it was when I was born, and my parents before me, and their parents before them. Folks understand the cove the way it is. But when things get different-- like that road you're aching for-- it puts things in edge. So what do I do? I don't know. Folks are wrong-headed right now, what with them poachers on the loose. Things might get better when they get caught. Does that include Ozias Holt? Oh, Ozias just don't want his Zach turning out like his brother. What do you mean? When Luke came age, he set off for Atlanta to work in a factory. He was going to make it rich so his family here would have it nice. Well, it didn't turn out that way. The factory was old and crowded... and one day there was a fire... But all the doors were locked and nobody got out. Luke died... and a piece of Ozias Holt died along with him. He and his brother were awful close. You see, Ozias never talked Luke into staying here at the cove, but he can make sure his Zach does. [ Chickens Clucking ] Christy, wait! Leave me alone! Christy... Christy, I have to talk to you. I don't have anything to say to you! What are you doing here? I came for the book you promised Zacharias Holt! If it's the book you wanted, why did you run away? I really don't care to discuss this. I have to go! Not until you answer one question-- Why did it upset you to see Harriet with me? I'm not upset. I-I was startled, that's all. Startled by what? The sight of someone having a cup of tea? May I go now? What about the book? Give it to Zach yourself! He's waiting for it at home. You know what I said about this, boy! The only book you need in this life is the Good Book! And the only life you need is right here where you was raised up, you hear me? Yes, sir. Now, I don't want to hear no more about college in the city. You belong in the cove with your own kind. [ Inaudible ] Mister Holt! This is no concern of yours, miss. Since it appears that my teaching is behind this, I think that it is. Mister Holt, I know why you're doing this to Zach, and I know about what happened to your brother, but it's not right to let the past rule your life. I'll be the judge of what's right for my kin--not you. Then at least please consider this: every parent wants their child to have a better life. That's why you sent Zach to the mission school, isn't it? Well, he has a chance to go even further-- further than his brothers and sisters, further than everyone in his class! He has the chance to be one of the few people from Cutter Gap to attend college, let alone medical school. That chance is a gift from God, Mister Holt, and it would be a sin to waste it because of a terrible tragedy that happened over 30 years ago. Zach! I didn't expect to see you here. Pa thought on it, teacher. Says he wants to see what that college says. That's wonderful! I guess. Let's get to work. Yes, ma'am. Alright, name the continents. Well, there's Africa, Asia, Australia... ...Temple of the Acropolis, the symbol of Athens? The Pantheon. No, that's the great church in Rome. Oh, sorry. The symbol of Athens is called the Parthenon. Parthenon... You did so well, Zach. I'm proud of you. T-Teacher, I'm real sorry about what--what folks been saying about you. Thank you, Zach. But your exam is the only thing you should be thinking about right now. [ Heavy Breathing ] [ Screaming ] Uhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhhh! Uhhhh! Ahh! David! Christy, what is it? Two...men...there. Jeb, keep an eye on her. [ Jeb: ] It's alright, Miss Christy. You're gonna be alright. You really shouldn't have been out there alone, Christy. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. I'll say you weren't. You're lucky it's only your ankle that hurts. Well, I should be getting back to work anyway. That road won't build itself. Thank you for protecting me. You can thank me by saying "yes" to my proposal. Don't you ever give up? Should I? You are wonderful, you know that. The fact may have eluded some of the more stubborn mountain families around here, and Ferrand, but I know it. David... I'll see you later. [ Gun shot ] [ Gasping ] [ Ault: ] Thief. What ya got there, Ault? [ Ault: ] Oh, we got us a prime catch, Bogg. Found him up at a cave by Lookout Rock. Well now, ain't that a poke in the eye? Lookout Rock... I reckon you fellas wasn't lookin' out enough. [ Laughing ] What happened to him? Oh, this one took a rifle stock to the head to bring in. You find my rifle he made off with? Sorry, Kyle. You boys got names? Clay Owens. Tutt Bradford. Where you from? Bristol. Oooh, that's a long way from here. Please!... We only took enough to eat. We were gonna pay everyone back. Let's do this away from the mission, Bogg. That suits me fine. [ Christy: ] Uncle Bogg, what are you doing? [ Clay: ] They're gonna lynch us! These proceedings ain't fit for no female. But you can't hang these men. Why not? First of all, Reverend Grantland is against it. [ Laughing ] He ain't here. These men may be responsible for crimes in other jurisdictions. If you execute them, the authorities may never know the full extent of-- of their actions. So you're siding with these poachers? Not them--you. I'm sure the Marshall in Lyleton will--will be grateful for you handing them in. You seem to be sure of yourself about a whole lotta things. And you're on the wrong side of most of them! Uncle Bogg...? It's time to butt out! [ Bogg: ] Now, let's make these boys a neck tie. [ Gun Shot ] Shame on you, gentlemen, for ignoring a lady's wishes. Harriet! Kindly leave the prisoners and be on your way! You outsiders sure stick together. No--people of decency do. Miss Christy! Ruby Mae, call the marshall in Lyleton. Tell him we have two prisoners and to get here as fast as he can. We should lock them up. There's a store room behind the barn. I'll do it. My head hurts. Shut your mouth! [ Fairlight: ] Okay, you two, get moving. I want no trouble. Thank you for all your help, Harriet. It was the least I could do. Christy, I owe you an apology for what happened at Neill's. What happened between you and Doctor MacNeill is none of my concern. I mean between the two of you. I don't know what you're talking about. He told me it was you he ran after. Christy, please believe me-- I didn't know that you have designs on him. But I don't! Christy, I'm a woman. If I'd been paying attention, then I would have seen it earlier. But I saw you at his cabin. Yes, you did. And as much as I would have liked for him to be interested in me, his heart was elsewhere. It's you he wants, Christy. He said that? He didn't have to. [ David: ] Christy! Christy! I saw Bogg and he's spitting nails. Why? Because he was denied the pleasure of killing two men? He said you shot at him. Umm, that was...me. This is bad, Christy. You know how much weight Bogg carries around here. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go check on Fairlight. He's gonna make life miserable for you. How? By turning the families against me? Or telling Doctor Ferrand to get rid of me? Those things are already happening, David. I have nothing to lose! Nothing? I think it might be a good idea if I left Cutter Gap when my contract is up next month. So you're running away. Obviously, God doesn't want me here. Don't blame this on God. I wasn't blaming Him. Then don't blame Ferrand or the families either. What you're running away from is me! David, how could you say such things? Because I'm not blind. I can see it in your face. You have no intention of marrying me. David, I.... And rather than face that fact, you're just going to leave Cutter Gap without a fight. Well, that's hardly the Christy Huddleston I know. [ Christy: ] Miss Alice, do you have a moment? Miss Alice, the families are rejecting any notion of progress in their lives. Many have grown suspicious of my intentions. Christy, I have watched thee struggle with these issues for days. However, this is not about you. Not about me, but my ability to work is at stake. Thy work is classroom instruction-- Not turning the cove into a place of thy liking. Why is God testing me? [ Laughing ] Oh... Christy, thy test is of thy own creation. I will tell you this-- that if these problems continue to obstruct thy ability to do thy work, then perhaps you had better leave. [ Christy: ] I had driven a wedge between David and me... And now even Miss Alice had given up on me. But then something David said hit home. He said that giving up without a fight was not the Christy Huddleston he knew. He was right, of course. And that had to change. What I said was, we didn't have no problems around here till you got the preacher to build that road! But that had nothing to do with the poachers. When one outsider shows up, swarms more are sure to come! Like them poachers! They're in jail right now! Way I heard it was, you stood against the lynchin'. They didn't deserve to die. Only an outlander would back their kind. Surely you don't agree with that. Well, Miss Christy, that's right hard to say. But you know I'd never go against the people here. This is my home! For now anyways. They all know that you'll be leaving us someday, and... All of us, well, we're in Cutter Gap for good. Miss Christy, you're back! I'm sorry I missed dinner, Ruby Mae. Oh, I saved you some fried possum. Want me to fix it? No, I'm not very hungry. Miss Christy, you know that little box you asked me to give preacher? Well, I sorta looked inside, and I swear, that was the most sparking thing I ever seen! I'm not feeling very well, Ruby Mae. I think I'll just call it a night. Okay. Good night, Miss Christy. Zach? Like I told you, I don't care what folks say. I don't care what folks do. I still want to try for that college exam tomorrow. [ Christy: ] At last, God had given me a sign! No matter what else was wrong in my life, I was still a teacher, and there was still one student who needed me. I had to put aside my problems to think about someone else. Frankly, it was a welcome change. But then it was time. Well, Zach, how do you feel? Umm, all jittery, teacher. Me too. Well... You've got one hour. Good luck. [ Christy: ] As Zach took the exam, my mind and pulse raced. I came to understand that this was as much my test as his. If I could send just one student off to college, then I could leave Cutter Gap with a sense of accomplishment. [ Sigh ] I'm done, teacher. Are you sure? I answered the ones I know. And I'm sure you did very well. Please send in Doctor MacNeill. Yes, ma'am. [ Christy: ] I don't know how long it took to grade the answers, but it seemed like an eternity. And Neill's familiar scowl of concentration didn't help matters. As much as I tried, I could not guess how Zach was doing. [ Sigh ] [ Christy: ] And then, he finished. Well, Doc? Miss Christy? I'm sorry, Zach, you didn't pass. Folks was right about you. How can this happen? Becoming a doctor is everything to him. Everything to him, or everything to you? What do you mean by that? Well, I was quite happy to help him with his studies, Christy, but quite frankly, there were times when I was wondering whose dream it was-- his or yours. That's a terrible thing to say. You became a doctor, why can't Zach? Well, for one thing, I wasn't spending my time attending a one-room schoolhouse and working in the fields and trying to raise livestock! And for another, I was lucky. Well, a lack of good fortune will not be very comforting to the Holt family. I'm aware of that. So what do I do now? Vanderbilt was his best chance. What do I tell him? You tell him the truth, Christy. Life isn't fair. And life in Cutter Gap is a lot less fair than some of us would like. Take it from me. [ Knocking ] Yes. May I come in? Of course. Christy, I owe thee an explanation. You don't owe me anything, Miss Alice. You were right. If I can't make things work here, then I should leave. A missionary faces an arduous challenge, Christy-- Sharing our faith with... with often an unwilling population, and doing what we can to bring joy to their lives. And that's exactly what I've been doing! No, child, I have watched thee steadfastly try to mold this place into a world suitable to you. That's not fair! Christy... Christy, I have made that same error in judgment. And that's why I was so harsh on thy plight, because you reminded me of myself. What you must think of me... That thy are a very caring young woman with so much to give. [ Man, yelling: ] Reverend? What is it? It's them poachers! They were all caught. Not all of 'em. They made off with the meat from my smokehouse... And we aim to get him. I'll get my coat. [ Christy: ] Word of the new robbery sent every man in the cove into action. But the idea of more poachers on the loose colored their search with a very real sense of anger and fear. How many of 'em you reckon there are? No telling'. Bogg shoulda hung them first two we got. Woulda scared the others off! Maybe not. Maybe this bunch is fixin' to stay! Hush up! You hear that? Over yonder... [ Gun Shot ] You've got him, Ozias! [ Shouting ] [ Moaning ] I shot...Bob Allen. Bob's hurt! [ Indistinct Chatter ] Give me a coat. Get a lamp. We'd best get doc now. I'll go! Okay! He's lost a lot of blood. Ruby Mae, get me my medical bag. Then boil some water and get us some towels! [ Alice: ] Get me the linens! Christy... I didn't know it was him. What can I do to help? Could you hold this compress? I'm still dizzy on my feet. Miss Henderson, that lead's gotta come out now. I can't do that. I can't... My vision is still blurry. Just tell me what to do! I seen Doc operate plenty. Zach, you can't... Maybe Vanderbilt College thinks that, but if we don't do for Bob Allen right now, he's gonna die. Go wash your hands in the kitchen. Yes, ma'am. I thought he was one of them poachers. Mr. Holt, he's in the Lord's care now. Better you should concentrate on praying for his recovery. It's alright, Mr. Allen. We're gonna take care of you. Take these instruments into the kitchen, and wash them, scald them. And towels-- I need lots of towels. Take this and pour into him as much as he can take. Yes, ma'am. Bob, you gotta drink. Bob, drink this. Drink this, Bob. Open your mouth. [ Moaning ] That's it-- open your mouth... ...and bite. [ Inaudible ] How is he, Doc? Well, he's much better than I expected. Zach, your surgery was a complete success. Bob will be good as new. Congratulations. It--It weren't much, Doc. I just... did what you'd do. You keep up on your studies, I'll wager you can still be a fine physician one day. We'll see. Zacharias, I just wanna say that you did something tonight that most men never could...especially me. You made me proud to be your pa. [ Woman: ] Everybody come quick! Lundy Taylor? Caught him red-handed. He had my wagon and most everything else that got stolen. It's alright now, sweetpea. We got the guilty one, alright. Yeah, he had a bundle of Tom's smoked pork. Never thought it'd be one of our own. I was just hungry, that's all! So hungry you'd do our family wrong? Preacher, I swear on my dead momma's soul-- I took that meat from Mister McHone, but I never stole nuthin' else. Oh, you hush up now, you hear me! [ Alice: ] Bogg, listen to this boy. The poachers confessed the crime. What were you gonna do with all of it, Lundy? Sell it down the mountain when that road was done. Boy, you know what you done? A man almost died on account of your foolishness! Miss Christy, I--I heard tell you was fixin' to leave the cove. I suppose it serves us right. Well, I--I wish you would change your mind. Good night. [ Christy: ] It took a lot for Uncle Bogg to say that... And it gave me hope. I realized that I still had a job to do at the mission school, even if I wasn't perfect. [ Christy: ] David! May I walk with you to see Harriet off? Certainly. You're so important to me, and I don't want to drive you away. I don't want you to either. Good. We better get going. [ Indistinct Chatter ] [ Harriet: ] I'd like to thank everybody for coming to see me off today. Before I go, I wondered if there was anyone here who would like to take a ride in my airplane. [ Ooohs and Aaahs, Indistinct Chatter ] Tom... What about you? You helped me fix it. I might be of a mind to give it a try. Sorta like to see what the mountains look like from above, like the Almighty does. Hop in. [ Applause and Cheering ] Contact! [ Engine Starts ] [ Christy: ] In the Bible it says that "God rode upon a cherub and did fly, and He was seen on the wings of the wind." That day in Cutter Gap, with Harriet Quimby's help, He did it all over again. Captions by CaptionHouse
