EVERYBODY IN JAIL Captain. Is Councillor Vanzetti in? Yes, he's the last to leave, judge. Alright. May I? - Excuse me. May I? - Who is it? - It's me, Councillor. - I thought you had already left. - Isn't it your wife's birthday? - Yes, Councillor. My wife can wait, work can't. - I wanted to compile the arrest warrants. - We could've done it Monday. Why postpone to Monday what we can do today? I've learned to know you well, Salvemini, in these years of collaboration! Truly many. And I hope you're pleased with me, even if not always I could do everything. You do even more than you should. - Yes, Councillor. - And zealously. Here are the arrest warrants. - Have you checked all the indictments? - Yes... yes, yes, Councillor. You can sign safely. Here you are, Councillor. Ambrogio Fornari: Mafia related criminal conspiracy Triple residence: Italy, Switzerland, United States.

I also wrote the arrest warrant for Msgr Kubisky, aka The Good Man, Vatican, involved, with his sister, in drugs, currency smuggling... Please, forget the sister! We have to review everything and see... Yes, as you wish, Councillor! Giovanni Andrea, Marta Costamillio, bankers. President, manager, lawyer of the "Ambra" holding company. Fraudulent bankruptcy, illegal export of capital. The bribes were paid in a bank... Please, upright! You're tickling me with those curls. Excuse me, the shampoo fluffs them. Will you sign please?

In the bribes inquest that's been going on for over three years, 17 new accused have been rounded up, adding to the other 72 in the "Who's Who" of serious organized crime, already in prison awaiting trial. The criticism of the judiciary that all newspapers have reported reverberates in the political environment. While hundreds of persons only suspected languish in prisons awaiting trial, the investigators have no other option but to continue a fight without quarter, but, also, without an end. Are you having fun? Of course I'm having fun dear! It's a rock! I like it! It's beautiful! - It sure is beautiful! - Annibale. - Yes, my dear? Are we here to celebrate my birthday, or do you have, as always, another aim? - What other goal, my dear? - That couple, for instance. Oh, that couple? He is the journalist Enrico Patellaro, talking head on TV. I find him particularly annoying on the screen. And now, seeing him in person, it's worse. He's odious. I know it, dear, you say this each time we watch the evening news. I do? Your annoyance went through the roof when you saw him with that gorgeous girl. Gorgeous, you say? Yes, she's cute. Cute?! She's splendid! I don't think that only a somehow frivolous journalist, but even a wise and toughened judge could lose its head for such a creature. Yes, I admit it, my dear, not a judge, but even a minister lost his head for her, You see you know more than you'd like me to believe? I don't want you to believe anything! It's you who want to know more than I can tell you. I'm your wife, after all! Yes, I know, so keep your mouth shut. They're looking at us. - We should go and sit down. - Bravo! This is a good idea. With this rock you should ask my wife. - You danced very well when you saw her. - I did? Jealous? Thank you, my dear. All the best! All the best, my dear! Thank you. Thank you all. Who'd say, looking at your husband. that he's a judge? You imagine a judge as a public figure, strict, who frightens people, In fact, at home, he's very sweet. It's true, Annibale, you're the exact opposite. You even take the liberty of going to nightclubs. And, then, you're such a dancer! You see, my father who was president of a Court of Appeal, he didn't dance rock, but, now, times have changed. ...helps maintaining the psychological balance, indispensable to a judge who has to decide the fates of numerous citizens... Hello?! Parisi speaking. I am Parisi. Yes. Parisi. My personal jet is in the parking lot. Here's your whisky, sir. Fill it up. If there's no news, we'll leave for Nice this evening. Thank you. See you later. Excuse me. - Has she arrived? - Yes, sir, she's here. Corrado Parisi, you're under arrest! - Annibale Salvemini! - Corrado! It's been twenty years! Where have you been all this time?! Around the world: South America, Europe, Middle East... I don't know who that is! - And now, you live in Rome? - I only come to Rome to visit mother. Oh, you're coming to Rome for you mother? - Do you remember her? - Of course I do! - Will you have something to drink? - A small whisky. Another one, Amedeo! I heard you on the phone waking the pilot. Do you have your own jet? No, a small jet my French friend loans me. He is a banker. A banker loans you his jet?! What line of work are you in? I'm a middle man. In international business. - What about you? - I got into the judiciary. - You are a judge?! - Yes. That's where the arrest warrant came from! - Did I scare you? - Not me, but, these days, many are. They shit their pants, especially in my business. Your business? What do you do? There're many kinds of business. I do a little of everything: banks, oil, software... They'll trembling! Guilty or innocent. - You know there's an inquest going on? - If I know? I'm running it! I and Councillor Vanzetti are precisely investigating the corruption cases. I see you're very well-informed. - I have to. That's my branch. - Bravo! I'd like talking to you, you being inside this complicated swarm of interests. Let's talk about it. But, is it as friend, or as a judge? As a friend, but I'm also interested as a judge. - I'm kidding you! - Sure you are! I know you, I know you're joking. That's why you can ask me whatever you wish. But, forgive me if I'm inappropriate, you run these investigations on these colossal fortunes... - How much you earn per month? - Around 2,500,000. Are you kidding me?! - How do you get by? - I manage. I am not rich, but my wife works and, with the little that father left me... Giovanna, this is Corrado Parisi, my old friend. - I told to you about him. - Oh, Corrado! - More than friends, we were brothers. - We've never met... - Glad to meet you. - Annibale often talks about you. - We haven't met for such a long time. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but it's already late. - Annibale tomorrow morning... - Let's take him home with us! We'll have another whisky and continue our... I'd gladly come, but I have a date here with a... woman. You haven't changed a bit! You know, Giovanna, since he was a kid he only thought about two things: women and business! Listen, now that you've reconnected, I hope you'll see each other... Don't just disappear for another twenty years! By the way, if I want to see you, where can I find you? When I am in Rome, I stay at the hotel, at the "Grand Hotel". For now, I temporarily live on the C?te d'Azur. Listen, when you are in Rome, this is my business card. My home and my office number! Don't disappear! Call me, alright? We'll get in touch sooner than you think! We'll call you soon! - It was a pleasure. - Bye, Corrado. - Bye, Corrado. - Bye. - And kiss your mother for me. - I will. - She'll be very pleased. - Bye, Corrado. My dearest ones, we have to say goodbye. Goodbye, and thanks for having come. Thank you. I'll see you afterward. You told me: "It's for life. " But I knew it'd end up one day. I knew you'd go back to her. And then, that day came. I know it. I feel it. Don't say you love me. Don't say anything. Let me dream a little more. - Annibale! - Please! Stay here a little more. Close to me. And then: Farewell! Is she the girl from the nightclub? Yes. You never take me anywhere by chance. Is she also among the suspects? I don't know that yet. I was looking at that brooch. - What do you think? How much could it be worth? - You call that a brooch?! It's a diamond adorned sapphire, that, if real, are worth at least 100,000,000. She's precious this girl. Do you think she's involved? - Why do you ask me that? - Curiosity. Oh, Giovanna, Giovanna, can it be that after twenty years of marriage, you still haven't understood that an investigation is secret, even for you? Alright, Annibale, I won't do it anymore. I was expecting the usual TV oxen. The usual primates, intrusive like always. You should realize a judge can't answer your questions. - I am Patellaro, from RAl. - Yes, Patellaro from RAl. During the roundup someone saw you in a nightclub. As you are the one that saw me, I saw you also. What're you doing? Yes, I was dancing late into the night. I was celebrating my wife's birthday. For other news about the roundup, ask Councillor Vanzetti. There he is! He's coming. - Good morning, Councillor. - Good morning, Salvemini. Careful, there's the usual step. - Don't keep saying it, or you make me stumble! - Yes, Councillor. - TV journalist Enrico Patellaro. Shall I get rid of him? - No, let him do. Good morning, I'm Patellaro, RAl. I'd like to ask the Councillor if it's true that in this night's roundup, like usually, only small caliber criminals were caught. When will the big fish follow? Councillor Vanzetti will not answer. He doesn't like fishing. Is it true, Councillor, that 150 arrest warrants are waiting on his desk, intended for personalities of the financial world, bankers, MPs and a summons for a cabinet minister? Do you think this is a question I can answer to? Do you think this is the right kind of question to ask? - What do you mean?! - The big mouth of RAl journalist! I really dislike that talking head. - Keep that for yourself! - Yes? We are from a private TV. The media has more than once been ironical about your long page-like hairstyle. - Well, Miss... I'll be right with you, Councillor. - Alright. You were saying? - I was referring to your long page-like hairstyle... - Yes. - What's your reaction to that? - I don't, but I'll answer you now. You see, Miss, we have to be very grateful to our democracy. Because, while granting the media total freedom of speech, it censors even less the length of the judges' mane. That means that, the more the media criticizes me, the longer I let my hair grow. Satisfied? - Thank you. - Don't try that again! - Oh man! Mr. judge! Mr. judge! Mr. judge! Mr. judge! - Who is it? - It's me, sir, the prior. Excuse me, but I'm rather in a hurry! We all are in a hurry, Father. Wait. - Concillor, the prior is here. - Show him in. - Very well. - Come in, Father. - Thank you. Sergeant... - If Miss. Del Monte arrives, ask her to wait. - Of course, sir. - Alright. - May I? - Please sit down, Father. Thank you, your Excellency, very kind of you. Could you please repeat exactly what you said at your last interrogatory about the Minister? Eight years ago, in the month of September, the Minister had requested permission to spend two weeks of retreat and reflection in our convent. And we were very glad to offer him our hospitality. And, during those two weeks, did the Minister receive any visitors? More than one, dottore. Do you remember if the Minister... .. received a visit... .. from this person? Look at him closely! I don't remember having seen this man, not in the convent, and not in photos. - Not even in photos? - No, your Excellency. Come on! But the picture is in all newspapers, even on TV! And who might this dear person be? You tell him, or I'll have a fit! This dear person you're referring to, Father, is yet another bankrupt. A famous currency exporter, money launderer, and even an instigator in a double murder case. And you, Father, sustain not even having seen his photo in the newspapers? Forgive my ignorance. In our seclusion convent we don't receive newspapers, and we have no TV. Do you know, Father, to what consequences you might be exposed, if your testimony were to be proven false? I've spent my life inside a cell, the prison doesn't frighten me! - Go, go! - I can leave? - You can leave, Father. - Thank you, your Excellency, and to you also, sir. - We're not making any progress! - In our prior's seclusion convent the monks grow marijuana for their personal usage. - Forget it! Let's see the serious stuff. - Yes, Councillor. - Who else to be interrogated? - Miss Iris Del Monte. - Bring her in. - Yes. Sergeant, show Miss. Iris Del Monte in. - Please, Miss, go in. - Yes. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Haven't I seen you already? - At the nightclub where you sing. - Salvemini! What're you doing? - Excuse me, Councillor. To celebrate my wife's birthday I took her to a nightclub, to shake a few moves... - Please, sit down. - Thank you. The search of your flat revealed a couple of grams of cocaine. Yes... A French friend lived with me for a coupe of weeks, she must have left it. Councillor, here's the agenda. We also found an agenda with the names of Italy's most famous and rich men. Including a Minister's... Miss Del Monte is often on TV, she sings a beautiful, sentimental song, "By And By", that I've hummed earlier, so it's only logical that many men want to meet her. - Allow her to answer. - Yes, Councillor. Answer, Miss. Well, a Minister's backing comes in handy for a girl wanting to make career on TV... You push and I push and if one manages to jump on the RAl wagon! Please, Miss, you are in a very delicate situation. I advise you to tell the truth. I swear, Excellency, that I'm not involved! Spare me the oaths and don't you also call me Excellency! You tell me how I am to call you! Forgive me, I'm so confused, my head's spinning, I don't understand anything! Councillor, the police captain is here. It's 10 o'clock. You're already late. - The prison interrogatory. - Yes, right! - I'll be right with you, captain. - Very well, Councillor. - You go on with the interrogatory. - Alright, Councillor. - Miss... sit down, please. - Thank you. Why are you so tense? That man scared me. I feel so... summoned! I can't think straight! I feel more at ease with you. That's fine! - Relax, Miss. - Can I smoke? Why not? - I'll keep you company and smoke too. - Please, have one. Thank you. Miss... Our investigation has shown that you have traveled abroad a lot these last years, even with private jets. True? When there's a party in St. Moritz or Monte Carlo these friends send their jets for me. It's usual nowadays, you know? Of course it's usual! Also because, in these small airports, one can skip the customs, isn't it so? Yes. Indeed, the customs officers don't even look at you. And so, you can carry, unnoticed a suitcase full of banknotes! You're saying all of this laughing, but I don't know if I should also laugh. Should I? Please laugh, if you find it funny, but someone has squealed that a couple of big bankers were using you to smuggle tens and tens of billions abroad. Still laughing? - Who says all of this? - Here's who says it. This note brings upon you serious suspicions, Miss. - Serious suspicions? - Yes. - What kind of suspicions? Of complicity, see? It's addressed to you. "Dear Iris, If you accept my proposition, the reward is 300 million. " Signed: "E. P. " As in Empoli Palermo. You see? Yes, I see it. It must be coming from RAl. With a three years contract offer. A nice offer... Alright, Miss, if it's a RAl offer, then everything's explained. Oh, I'm so glad! Forgive me, but I feel more relieved. You do? And do you remember the name of the manager who signed this note? - Well... Empoli Palermo? - Yes, Empoli Palermo. I can't remember it. You know, at the RAl they're all managers. How witty! But don't let them hear you, or they might not let you sing anymore. Good. Thank you, Miss, you may go. Thank you. My luck I found an understanding person like you. Goodbye, Miss. - Then, you're saying I can rest assured? - You see, Miss, as long as you have an appointment with justice, I'd never advise anyone to rest assured. Yes, I know that. - But I'm counting on you. - Very well, Miss, do that. - Goodbye, dottore. - Goodbye, Miss. Clerk? - Yes, sir. Check if anyone with the names beginning with "E" and "P" works at RAl. And then make a request to have Miss Iris Del Monte's phone out under surveillance, - and send it to the police. - Yes. - Iris Del Monte. - Yes. - Hello? Right away. - I'll take it. Salvemini speaking. Good morning, Excellency. No, I'm D'Allessio. The Attorney General wants to talk to you. You mind coming down? Tell the Attorney General I'll be right there. Let's hope we won't go back to that argument. Because, anyway, I won't cut my hair! I'm saying this in the most informal... and brotherly way, we were hoping that dottor Vanzetti, with your help, would be able to wrap up the investigation... in one week. What do you think? No, Mr. President, I don't think dottor Vanzetti can wrap up the investigation. Two years of work, 3,000 pages, hundreds of suspects, and many arrest warrants still to be checked. Are you aware that, next Monday, dottor Vanzetti will leave office? Yes, I am aware. He's retiring. As a matter of fact, I'm wondering who will take over his position? Well, no matter what magistrate we'd appoint to his position, would have to start everything anew. - It could take months, years, maybe... - I understand. And we must avoid that. The public opinion is exasperated, not to mention the press. Remember the Patellaro case, hundreds in prison still awaiting trial! You see, my dear Salvemini, the only person having worked for three years with dottor Vanzetti, and who knows in minute details all the components of the preliminary investigation, is you. Therefore, it's you that we must entrust with the preliminary investigation, so that you finish it in the shortest time possible. I thank you, gentlemen, for the trust I am being shown! - We are the ones who thank you. - I am. Dottor Salvemini. - Yes? - Just a moment. Tell me, President. What's been said here, it's been said in an absolutely informal manner, in absolute secrecy. Therefore, no one must know anything. - Please. - No one will no know anything! - That's the way! - Thank you once again. - Oscar. - Good morning, judge, sir. - Can you mind car? - I'll put it in the garage. Congratulations for your new assignment! The what?! Annibale, this is a wonderful day for you! Unbelievable! It was meant to be a secret! My foot, even the doorman knows it! - Hi, daddy. - Hi, Julia. Look how many telegrams! Even from mom! Take them into my office. I'll read them later. And all these flowers, presents... What's with this exhibition? Our friends, as soon they found out. Julia, what do the newspapers write? They're all wondering what're your opinions, what's your political trend. - Annibale! - Yes. This is a present from your friend. The one we ran into in the nightclub. In the nightclub? That's Corrado. He's sent me a drawing. You see? It's a drawing. - Damn! It's a Picasso! - It's nice. He's funny. What do you mean?! It's a Picasso. Look, Julia! - Is it an original? - An original? I wish it were! It's a print. Were it an original, it'd be worth hundreds of millions. But I like it all the same. - Listen what this newspaper writes. - What? Let's hear. "With his long and curly hair, the news judge reminds us of a rock star, rather than of a strict magistrate." I know what they are alluding to, to my hair. - You look great with it. - I know I look great with it. There's no need to tell me that. I know I look great with it. Salvemini, speaking. - Annibale, it's Parisi, congratulations - Even you've found out, imagine that! - Everybody has found out! - Corrado, you shouldn't have! What's with all these flowers, presents... - It's the least I could do. - You shouldn't have! - Where are you calling from? - I'm on the Cote d'Azur, in a friend's mansion. What are your plans for this week-end? What can we do on a week-end? The usual: staying at home, resting. Isn't it so, Giovanna? - We might go to the seaside. - My wife says we might go to the seaside. - Why don't you come here, then? - Where's that? - Here, on the Cote d'Azur. - He says we go to the Cote d'Azur. - I'd love that! - Giovanna says she'd love it. But I can't, it's too far away. On Monday at 8 AM I have to be in court. I'll send the private jet. In one hour you are here, and you'll go back when you wish Are you joking, Corrado? We aren't used to that kind of life. I'm not joking, on the contrary. Remember that night, at the nightclub, we started an interesting conversation? - Yes. - So you remember. Fine. Take the jet, come here with your wife, and during the weekend we'll talk about things that could prove very useful to you You know I'm an expert, don't you? If you send the jet, I'd almost... - That's the way I want you! - Well, Giovanna? - Yes! The jet's waiting at the airport. - I'll send the Rolls to pick you up. - Very well. See you soon, then. Get ready, Giovanna! In less than an hour, we're off to the Cote d'Azur! Oscar? I want to speak to Mr. Minister. Colonel Bocci. - Hello. - Euclide? You again? Let's hear it, colonel. You've read the evening papers? Yes. I was just reading that the investigation will stay with Salvemini. Yes. Unfortunately, that old wise man Vanzetti is retiring. Who is this judge Salvemini?! Up to today, an illustrious unknown. Now, that he's the master of our destinies, everybody's wondering to what political trend he belongs to. That's what I'm wondering too! And then, with that hair-style! How wonderful! In a few minutes we're already in France! See? What did I tell you, Giovanna? Captain, could you tell me how much this two way travel costs? - Around 6-7 millions. - Wow, seven millions?! - Judge Salvemini? - Yes. The voiture is ready. Mister Parisi is waiting for you at the villa. Great, let's go, Giovanna! - Goodbye. - Goodbye, madam. - Goodbye, captain. - Goodbye, judge, sir. - Je vous en prie. - Merci. - Toute de suite, monsieur. - Oui. Wonderful! We're in France! - Are you happy, my darling? - Yes, very! Where's he going? Please! Please, chauffeur... Don't we go through customs? Non, monsieur, nous passons par un passage priv?. Le voila. Le voila. - Through a private passage, he says. - I heard. Ce sont des amis de Monsieur Parisi. Tres bien. Passez! Ouvre! Mister Parisi's friends, he says. Des amis, but... had we had a suitcase full with banknotes or cocaine, nobody would have checked. Even this is an useful experience, isn't it? You bet it is! Annibale, look, so many flowers! So beautiful! Annibale! - Corrado! - My dear, Annibale! - Je suis venu aujourd'hui, see? - Welcome. How was your trip? - Thank you. - A trip? You call that a trip? - Corrado, hi! - Giovanna is enthusiastical! - Thank you, my dear, for bringing him. I live here, in this wonderful place, many months a year, as if it were... as if it were my home! - Then, it isn't your house? - Whose is it then? - A big Milan businessman's. - Do you see him? - How could I miss him?! Cavaliere Mariotti. Cavaliere Mariotti, here's judge Salvemini, I talked to you about. Of course, my respects, judge, Italian newspapers get here too, otherwise how could I follow the Milan stock exchange? - Welcome. - My wife. - My respects, madam. - Glad to meet you. We thank you for your hospitality, cavaliere. - My house is at your disposal, judge. - Thank you. - Champagne? - Gladly! - Alright with you, Giovanna? - Of course. But first I'd like to freshen up. By all means! Giovannino, show the lady to her room. Thank you, later. Come and sit down, judge, on the veranda. Breathe this soiodic air What a beauty! So, this wonderful villa is yours, cavaliere? If it's the friend asking, I answer yes. If it's the magistrate asking, I answer sni. Please, sit down, judge. Why sni? What's with this interrogatory?! He's joking. The villa is of a Swiss company. I was only asking because it's beautiful. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. You're too kind, judge. Everything's in order. D'you see this gentleman? D'you know who he is? He's an electronic brain! He's the man who cuts the mustard at the Milan Stock Exchange. Really? You work at the Stock Exchange? Most interesting! All the ups and downs, with shares going up and going down... - Unfortunately, I know nothing about it. - Look! If you are not aware, beware! And beware the dollar! That's the big bad wolf! Today it's happy! But tomorrow, if they put a mameluke in Reagan's place, it'll leave you fucking broke! - Have you heard how simple it is? - Yes. Anyway, thank for your advice, cavaliere. A friend's advice. Look! For people like you who don't know the ropes, I always advise the basket! The basket? And what is a basket, sorry? - Exactly what it says. You take a basket. - Yes. You put inside a handful of dollars, one of German marks, they're always honest, and a generous fistful of Swiss francs. So, if one currency goes down, the other one, that's livelier, saves you. Did you hear how the cavaliere made clear the world situation in a few brushes? - Have you got the basket? - I? Well, I might have a basket at home, too bad it's empty. There's no dough to put into it. The dough is the least important! - Oh, yes? If someone like you, of your standing, just calls me on the phone, I will open you right away an account and get you a credit. - Is it that easy? Of course! When you decide to get a basket, call me at this number. Thank you, cavaliere! - Buenas tardes, amigos! - Here he is! - Come, come! How is it qu? va? - Fine. Mister Ferrero, judge Salvemini. - Oh, Ferrero... - Encantado. - Are you from Turin? What do you mean? Venesuelano! Venusuelano, you say... Do you also own a villa here, on the Cote d'Azur? No, our Ferrero wanders around, always on the sea. He lives on a 50 meters yacht, with two Rolls-Royce engines! Judge, it's been years since I've made a home from my boat. - Mira! Do you like it? - Where? That one? And you call it a boat?! 50 meters... that's a ship! How much does it cost only to move it? Mucho! But I have fun! Those engines are gas-guzzlers! But what does he care? He's one of the biggest oil producers in Venezuela! Congratulations. With your leave, I'll also go freshen up. I'll join my wife. We'll talk later. Show the judge to his room. - Thanks for everything, cavaliere. - At your service, judge! - Well, what do you think of him? - Well... Seeing the mug he has one finds him likable. But, isn't he too curious? It's his job, but he's an old friend. Didn't I tell you Aurelia? This judge from Rome is one of us. Yes, but when you don't know someone... - Did you expect such an welcome? - It's true, madam. When they told us: "Come to dinner, the famous judge Salvemini will be there"... .. I got the shakes? But, then, seeing your smiling, merry face and your... forgive me, curls, my heart opened up! All the more now, that we've met, judge you'll do us the honour of being our guest With pleasure. - You also have a villa here? - Yes, nearby. - Overlooking the sea. Listen, Corrado, about our discussion... You were asking about the bribes... - True. Let's hear. - Well... In America, if you help two people strike a business deal, let's say a 1,000,000 $ deal, well, you, by the law, mind me, by the law, - you have the right to get 3%. - In America? - Yes. Am I not right, cavaliere? - Of course you are! But, if I do the same thing in Italy, the newspapers would write right away that I was bribed! And the next I'd wake up in the joint! So, it's the law that's wrong, what do you think, judge? The law might be wrong, but I'm a judge and I have to implement it, or I'd be the one waking up the next day in the joint! Please, let's not joke about the joint, it brings bad luck! The only who can get bribes without any fear is my husband; he has parliamentary immunity! You'd never be able to put him inside! Are you sure, madam? Gisella, don't drink or you'll prate! That's how she is? Judge, have I said something stupid? Yes, but don't you worry, madam. We all say stupid things. He's so cute this judge! That's what we were also saying yesterday, at dinner. There were politicians, bankers, even a Minister. And they were all saying: "He's so cute, this judge, with his curls! We must invite him to our house and try to befriend him!" What're you saying? The judge already is a friend! You drink too much and then yap. Here we are! I knew it that sooner or later you'd say something dumb! She must be really drunk to speak this way! But I... but I only wanted to make a compliment to our guest! - I've understood that. - We have, madam, and we thank you. Enough said! Who wouldn't like having such an welcome guest at his table?! - Let's toast to our dear magistrate! - Thank you. To your health! Giovannino! Take the champagne on the terrace! If anyone wants to have a little fun, a round of chemin... - O... there's the chemin. - Yes. Will you also have a round, judge? - But the chemin means gambling! - Gambling?! - Punishable by law... - If you say so, no round of chemin... A little music, chitchat... - I'll take the round with my friend. - Please! Do as you wish, you're at home in my house! - Did you hear? - What did he say? - You didn't hear?! Gambling is prohibited! We're on the Cote d'Azur to have fun! If he says "the law prohibits", I get agitated and have no fun anymore! Listen, Corrado. I'm really grateful for this invite, and I thank you for having introduced me to these people. It's really revealing, but do satisfy a curiosity I have: these Italians living here on the Cote d'Azur, with swimming-pools and yachts and private jets, fatsoes that offer you their villa, talk about baskets, of dollars smiling, marks weeping, who are they? - What? - Yes, these people, what do they do? They are people who, affording to leave Italy, made an easy life for themselves. Easy? Why? They're rich, healthy, they must have had a reason for leaving Italy. Tell me the truth. What's the matter? Pending law actions? What law, what truth?! They're all friends of mine, honest people! I vouch for it! Alright, if you vouch I believe it, but why don't they live in Italy? Oh, you think is simple living in Italy? If you're into the Stock Exchange, in building, oil imports... even if you work in all honesty, you're always afraid of making some mistake! - Afraid of what? - We're in Italy, afraid of everything! Afraid of taxes, of the IRS, of the finances, of the handcuffs... But, if they are so anxious and afraid of handcuffs, it could be that they have something to hide. Annibale, one can always make a mistake! When they hear you have 300 arrest warrants in your case, of course they wonder. It's good they do that, but, if these gentlemen acted honestly, they should be at peace! Easy to say. You see they are at peace, poor souls, also because, Annibale, you?re my friend, right? - I am. - But you're also the magistrate who knows the names of the suspects, dangles the handcuffs, - It depends... - But you're bound by the secrecy of the investigation. Of course I am. I know about all that... I am not asking you to break the secrecy... - What're you saying?! - Don't get me wrong! I'm only asking one thing. Let's hear it. I'm only asking if ingeniere Arduinni, commandante Ferrero... .. and cavaliere Mariotti, the fatso, he's even got asthma... .. what should they do now? - What do you mean? - Can they be at peace, or should they go on being afraid? What's asthma got to do? If they're honest people, they should be at peace! Yes? I wanted to hear you say that, thanks, Annibale! So, according to you, they're citizens that can go back to Italy without any fear Why say "can", they must go back! They have every right to! They're Italians! As far as I'm concerned there's nothing! Send them all back! Here it is... Here, Salvemini... Here are the files. You'll be left alone to get this difficult assignment done. - Very well. - Now,.. with a simple gesture and no formalities, I trustfully leave into your hands the inquiry I have conducted, with your precious help, for more than three years. I am aware of the responsibility! In this folder there are 354 arrest warrants, Very well! that I haven't yet signed. Couldn't you sign them, and close the inquiry yourself? - No. - No? I have thought about it till late last night... and I couldn't reach a conclusion. You are lucky to have all the time you need to look over some files of the inquiry, reach your conclusions, and meditate before issuing the arrest warrants. Have no doubt, Councillor. - I hope that, Salvemini. - Rest assured. Good luck and be careful. Than you, Councillor. I will really need it. Councillor. Now that you're leaving and I'll be left alone with my responsibilities, wich last advice would you give me? The one Talleyrand gave, in his time, - to all the men of law. - Tell me. "Surtout, pas trop de z?le." Above all, not too much zeal! Goodbye, Councillor. De Luca... - See the Councillor off, then come straight back. - Yes, sir. Talleyrand... "Surtout... " "pas trop de zele... " "Above all, no excessive enthusiasm. " Mr. Minister, colonel Bocci is on the phone. Excuse me, please. Congressman... Carlo, you come also. Come, mother. - Hello. I'm listening, colonel. - Good news. Vanzetti did not sign the arrest warrants. The transfer went along without any bloodshed. Magnificent! Perfect! Thank you, Bocci. Mother, everything's just fine! And now we should cultivate a little this judge, Salvemini, shouldn't we? - Cheers! - Cheers! I don't know why... but the echo of these sirens... gives me black thoughts... forebodings. It frightens me! Less than one hour after Councillor Vanzetti has left his assignment, judge Salvemini has already signed 152 arrest warrants, that, according to sources in the Justice Department, had been lying for months on the desk of the old and cautious magistrate. The trap of the biggest roundup in the last years. has closed in various towns from the North, the South and the center In the trap fell personalities above suspicion of the world of finances, banks, and, even, politics. It'd seem an entire town council was arrested. Personalities above suspicion were arrested while sleeping, or trying to run away. Drug refineries and warehouses, hideouts and stacks of arms have been routed. The secret service men and bosses of the so called occult powers of the parallel Mafias, were surprised in their circles, where, for years, they had plotted, undisturbed, against the state and the democratic institutions. Thank you. - Are you Miss Iris Del Monte? - Yes, I am Iris Del Monte. I have an arrest warrant for drugs trafficking. - Signed by who? - By the judge Salvemini. That's not possible! He told me to relax! No! Sergeant, wait, don't push me! According to the law, I should handcuff you. Are you afraid I'll run away?! The judge was so nice when he interrogated me! We had a few laughs, we smoked a cigarette, and now he arrests me? Then that was a trick! - Can I phone mother? - No. - Urbino Da Aragona? - Yes, I'm here. - You're coming with us. - No! I'm not Urbino Da Aragona! No! I'm not Urbino Da Aragona! - Take care, please! - Don't worry, madam. You can't go through, madam! They talk so much about the Cote d'Azur, but our country's air is something else! You're right. Look, they're coming with the siren! Oh, these are the carabinieri! - Are you cavaliere Angelo Mariotti? - Yes, at your service. - And you're Mr Claudio Ferrero? - Exactly. - We have arrest warrants for you. Warrant... The handcuffs?! It's a mistake! - I am a friend of judge Salvemini's... - He signed the warrants. - Mr sergeant, listen... - Get in. Sergeant, I demand to be taken to the Venezuelan Embassy! - We met in Cote d'Azur! - We had champagne together! You're no Venezuelan, you're Italian! While we're bringing you this, the implacable roundup still goes on. Private homes, public venues, banks and even untouched convents... .. were subjected to police intervention who arrested a prior, 3 nuns and a couple of laymen protected by them and hiding in the seclusion cells. And with this last an little rejoicing news, we end our news bulletin. Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all good night. - Good night and thanks, Patellaro. - Bye, Perugini, bye all of you. TV journalist Enrico Patellaro? Yes. What's the matter? What do you wish? - You're under arrest. - Under arrest?! - What's he saying? - But, handcuffs?! - They're taking away Patellaro! Salvemini?! He said I was alright! Dottor Perugini! - They've arrested me! - Stay calm, stay calm, Patellaro! Are you joking?! They've handcuffed me! They're taking me to prison! Oh my God! I'm feeling ill! Take me to the hospital! I have a heart condition! - What's up? - We lost Patellaro! - Good morning, judge. - Good morning. Here they are! Judge, after last night's 150 arrests those trusting your caution were badly let down. It's exactly because the alleged offenders trusted my excessive caution... .. that they were surprised sleeping and returned from abroad only to get arrested. Handcuffing a known journalist well-loved by the public revolted the whole country. What have you to say? That it's a dangerous drift of public emotion that should leave me indifferent! - May I, judge? - You again?! Unfortunately, the usual private TV. Go ahead, network! Our female viewers are curious to know the shampoo you use to have such soft hair. I don't do commercials. The curls are natural. I have other things to attend to. Let's go, De Luca! To the prison. Please, judge, a photo! Play with your hair! - Judge Salvemini. - Open up! - Judge Salvemini. - Come in. - Please, judge. - Thank you. - Patellaro? - Dottor Patellaro is in number 3. Judge, I'm feeling ill! I am feeling so ill! Stay calm. Unwind, don't worry. Relax, stay calm, make yourself comfortable. I can't. I announced your roundups everyday on TV and I now find myself... .. in the long line of offenders. Don't be sorry about it, dottor Patellaro. Many blind men have guided blind men before losing their sight. I beg you... I feel like dying. Tell me, at least, what am I accused of! You, Mr Patellaro, four years ago, accompanied a ministerial commission, led by the Minister, for a crude oil supply. - Yes. I... I went with that commission... the Minister... But as a journalist! For that supply, a 100 billion bribe was paid. - Did you know that? - Yes. I think the bribe was okayed. But... I... didn't know anything! Three cheques were written. A 50 billion one for the son of the sheik... .. and two other, 25 billion each. For whom were the other two cheques? I don't know... look... don't ask me... I'm feeling ill. I'm feeling ill. Miss Iris Del Monte was also on that trip. She now performs as a singer in a nightclub. Do you know her? Yes... I think so... - She was with us. - Yes. But not in an official capacity... She had come with a middle man. - Do you know this middle man's name? - No. I don't remember it. Do you at least know with whom was Miss Del Monte going to bed with, I mean... .. with whom was she sharing her bed in the hotel? Listen, judge, I don't remember it, I only know that the girl had room - 204. - 204... - Yes. Do you know if Miss Del Monte left her room in order to get into that of the Minister? No, look... I only remember that the Minister... - Yes? was staying in room 206. 206. Patellaro, is this your note? - No. - How come, after that voyage, you offered Miss Del Monte the sum of 300,000,000? It's in your writing, isn't it? I'm feeling ill... Look, that is not my note... .. I've never had 300,000,000... .. even less for giving it to a woman! You could have made much more with a bribe... It's in your writing... These are your initials: "E", "P"... Enrico Patellaro. Patellaro, come on, repent! What don't you tell me what happened on that voyage? What was your role? Patellaro, come on, tell me the whole truth! Miss Del Monte, what was her relation with the Minister? Tell me the names of your accomplices! It's in your interest! Come on! Repent! - Judge. - Who is it?! What're you doing?! I'm interrogating him. - But he's fainted! - Damn! I thought he was thinking! "FEMALE DISTRICT PRISON" Relax, be calm, Miss. Make yourself comfortable. And do tell me, who was your official traveling companion? A middle man. And did you accidentally run into the Minister in that Tehran hotel? I've never said it was accidentally. The middle was using me to attract the attention of the Minister, and of the others. Was journalist Enrico Patellaro also mixed in this big oil deal? No, he was there only for work. What work?! Delivering a bribe? I don't know, I've only met him then, on that voyage. I found him a nice, honest person. - You did? - Yes. The nice journalist offered you 300,000,000, you see? - No, no, I swear to you it was not him. - These are his initials:... - "E","P", Enrico Patellaro. - These could be the middle man's. - They can? - Yes. What is the middle man's name? Emilio Parisi, but everyone called him mister Emilio. Emilio Parisi?! That's correct... "E", "P"... A relative, maybe, of Corrado Parisi? - I don't know. - How did you get to Tehran? - With one of his friends' private jet. - One of his friends' private jet... Hello. Salvemini. Who is it? - I'm Parisi. - Hey! Corrado! Where're you calling from? What's happening?! I send my friends to Italy and you arrest them?! Well, it must be that your friends were accused. How, accused? You told me to send them back to Italy! No! I specified: "If they really are innocent, they can go back. " Obviously, they misunderstood me. And now, what should they do? Nothing! Now they're all in prison. They must be calm and trust the law. - So you say! - Can I come and meet you? - Of course you can, Corrado. As a matter of fact, you must come right away. Leave immediately. And if you come with your jet, I'll send for you at Ciampino. Bye, Corrado. See you soon, my dear. Are you mister Corrado Parisi? I got it, it's my friend, judge Salvemini, who's pulling one over on me! No, it's no joke. We got a summons warrant for you. A summons warrant? But he said he'd send for me at the airport! And indeed we came! Here we are! - Go, Clemente. And turn the siren on! - Right away, captain! This way. - Here we are. Wait here! - Sure. - Mr Corrado Parisi is here. - Yes? Oh, Franceschi, take my place. I'll receive him. - Show him in. - Come in, please. Annibale, you say you'll send someone to pick me up and the police is there! What's more efficient and timely than the police? You should appreciate it. Besides, I must warn you that in here formal speech is mandatory. Sure, I understand, if it's mandatory... It is. Rather, many suspicions are weighing on you. My colleague wants to interrogate you. - yes? - Go! Good morning, dottore. Glad to meet you. I'm ready to answer all your questions, but let's not take it tragically... Indeed, could I offer you something, a whisky? - Could you order a bottle of champagne? - A bottle of champagne?! No, no champagne! You can't drink in here! We're not on the Cote d'Azur! This is not a feast, and you'll realize! - Sit down and answer the questions. - I'm listening. Corrado Parisi, living in Cap Ferrat, on the Cote d'Azur, triple residence: USA, - France, Italy. - Three of them. - Yes, three. Why? Is it forbidden? - Hear that? Mr Parisi, how many times did you join a ministerial commission for... .. crude oil supply in the Middle East? Many times. This is what I do. Why? Because here it says: "A 100 billion bribe was paid to a sheik's son through a wealthy operator's dealings" - Hello. - My dear President... By this call we have no intention of pressuring in any way the judiciary... .. but only to inform you that judge Salvemini is Mr Parisi's childhood friend. I want to thank you, Congressman, but we were already aware of that. You were? And you find it alright that a judge interrogates an old friend?! No, it's not alright! As a matter of fact, judge Salvemini has delegated the task to the state attorney who is now conducting the interrogation. Then, everything's by the book? - Of course! - Then we'll have to admit that this judge Salvemini is a real fox! May I remind you, Congressman, that here we are at the Palace of Justice... .. and not in a Zoo! Try and remember, Corrado Parisi, or we'll be here till tomorrow morning. I've told you all I know. Then, as you are the mystery middle man, you should also remember what room was the Minister staying in. Where did he sleep? The Minister slept in room 206, Miss Del Monte in 204 and... - the TV journalist in 210. - Where? Did you and Miss Del Monte share the bed? I wish we did. I told you, she isn't a loose woman. Miss Del Monte was with me because, in the Arab countries, that type of woman is very desired. As a matter of fact, with your help, the deal was concluded by paying the son of the sheik a 100 billion bribe. An authorized bribe. To us it looks like the son of the sheik got only a 50 billion cheque. Where did the other 50 billion go? Maybe it was split up among you, the TV journalist Patellaro and the Minister? What're you saying?! Is that a joke? For my part, I only got a 20 million cheque! Not even the fuel cost. You got 20 for fuel expenses, and you offered Miss Del Monte 300 for her part. Read this: the initials of your name: Emilio Parisi. Emilio? No, my name is Corrado. No, no! The civil registry has you as: "Corrado Emilio Parisi"... .. and it's known that, in some unsavory businesses, you're called "Mr Emilio". Come on, Annibale, say it that you're after me! You do everything to nail me! So, this slip of paper is not signed by you? No! It's not mine! It's not mine! We found out that, on your return from Teheran, you bought an yacht, a villa on the Cote d'Azur, and an airplane worth 20 billion. Come on! You just prove they're mine! I haven't got anything to my name! Not even a bicycle! - We'll prove it. - You can go. Go! - Go. - Go, go! Go, go, Mr Parisi. And your current address in Italy? I told you, didn't I? For a couple of days I'll be at the "Grand Hotel", room 111. Corrado Emilio Parisi! We're not through with you yet! Stay at the "Grand Hotel", so we know where to find you! Is it clear? I get it, Annibale. I'll remain at the "Grand Hotel". - Mr Minister... - Oh God! What? Who is it? - It's me, Mr Minister. - What d'you want? - Colonel Bocci's on the phone. - Give it to me. Bocci? What's the matter? Euclide, forgive me if I woke you up. It's been three days and three nights... Del Monte? Yes! He's interrogating her round the clock! He wants to make her admit she had sexual intercourse with you in the Middle East! - Cameras, partusas, sex toys came up! - What sex toys?! I've always said I've never liked a judge with such a mane! Then, he must want to ruin me! Why is this hippie investigating my sexual life?! The waiter Mustafa says, textually: "Mr Minister was reading in a low voice from a small black book, and the young woman was throwing him such an enchanted... .. and seductive look that she seemed in absolute ecstasy. " Were you that young woman in ecstasy? And what was so that so out of the ordinary the Minister was reading? "The Gospel According To St Matthew" What chapter? The parable of the multiplication and division of the loaves and fish. Maybe Mr Minister was alluding to a fair division of the bribe? Either it's me who is very naive, or it's you who are a cynic, who knows only too well the human nature, and of whom I should only be afraid. Wait, Miss. You mustn't be scared. You shouldn't worry. Know that a judge is always only on the accused's side! On the accused's side?! I'm learning that on myself... Come, Miss. - The villa on the Cote d'Azur... - Yes? .. was the property of a Swiss company. - Swiss. - La "Cozma". - The "Cozma". - Whose actions were bought... - By who? - By a Canadian company... - owned by Parisi. - Good. So, - the villa, - Yes. as well the plane, belong to that bastard friend of yours. And I was nothing else but a front. Let's say, a blockhead. Now, commander Ferrero. Shall we talk about that luxurious boat? My boat belongs to the a Venezuelan company... "Los hijos de Ramon Fernandez". - But all the shares were bought by Mr Parisi. - Parisi... So you showed off as a big oilman, owner of this superb yacht, in order to protect Parisi from the IRS, isn't it so? But, actually, even you were a big blockhead! - Not to call you something else. - Judge! I'm a retired Navy officer! I've served the motherland, I'm ready to serve it again, by giving everyone away! Alright. Are you ready to sign your statements? At your orders, judge. As soon as I saw the handcuffs, I repented right away. And as I'm also kind of asthmatic, if you take me out of this inferno and you give me house arrest, I'll denounce all those to whom I made baskets, and "gardens" in Switzerland, and I'll sign whatever you say, judge! I'm happy for you and hope to see you soon on TV. - Thank you very much. - Good luck. - To you too. - Avvocato! - I'm here! Iris! Here I am! I had no hope anymore the judge would show himself so sympathetic. Sympathetic?! If it had depended on him, you'd still be in isolation. - Who freed me, then? - I filed an appeal... .. and I got a court judgment revoking judge Salvemini's arrest warrant. - How did he take it? - Must be careful. He won't let go. - You'd better leave... - God, how I hate that man! I'd like to get away from everything! Come on, let's go home! - I'm really satisfied, my dear Monsignor. - Yes? Yes, because I got Miss Del Monte out of prison, today I freed the three nuns and tomorrow we'll also get the prior out of prison. - Bravo, sir! - I love seeing that judge suffer! Go on arresting people, I'll set them free anyway... - Mr. Baldelli? - Yes, it's me. - I've got an arrest warrant for you. For me?! Who signed it? Judge Salvemini! How can that be... You free the others and now they're arresting you?! Oh Jesus! Is there anyone who can stop him?! It's not me they're after! I know who they are after! O my Jesus Whom I love and kind, In my darkness I've been blind! Here's the arrest warrant for Mr Corrado Parisi. - And the address, judge? - "Grand Hotel", room 111. At what hour should I arrest him? Perfectly knowing his habits, women, night life, nightclub's attender, I'd say he always gets home very late. Wait him at 3 AM, so you don't risk him slipping away. - Crystal clear. - Go, captain. And, please, top secrecy: he's the key man of our investigation. - Don't doubt it, judge. - Go, go. - Hello, who is it? - It's Parisi. I've already packed. - Me also. - Before going away, could we spend a couple of hours together? You're losing your time. - I?m offering you 400,000,000. - Well, you might as well know this: I fell in love. In love?! Whom with? Do I know him? Unfortunately, he's married and much older than me. He's also into law. Into law?! Are you telling me you've fallen for my enemy, judge Salvemini? Those long interrogatories in the close intimacy of a cell... .. and the figure of the authoritative, paternal judge... .. with that nice artist's mane! You're laughing, but judge Salvemini doesn't lack charm. A subtle, insidious charm... Hey, what do I care? I fight with my weapons! I'm offering you 600,000,000. Iris? Have you heard? Yes, I have heard. 600,000,000. I can't now. There's a taxi downstairs waiting to take me to the airport. - Annibale, it's 3 o'clock! - Yes. - Who's calling at this hour?! I know who it is! I was waiting for this call! - Yes, Salvemini here. - It's the captain. - Tell me, captain. - Judge, a strange thing happened. - Meaning? - Mr Parisi hasn't returned at the hotel. How come he didn't return?! Why do you say it's very strange? Last night he left the apartment and vanished. Must have had an informer! Send the warrant to the Interpol! Cable all the countries in the world! - I will. - Please, captain! He had an informer? He got away? Yes, he got away. The informer... I'll finish listening to this tape and I'll join you. - You want to be alone, right? - You got it. - Still the nightclub girl. - It's work! - Good night. - Good night. Lawyer Baldelli. Who is it? Corrado Parisi. I've offered Miss Del Monte 400,000,000. - And what did she say? - To speak with you. - You must rise. She wants 600. - Then you've already talked to her. Alright, agreed. Where's Iris now? She found work at the 'Mamoulian" hotel Marrakech, Morocco. .. 'Mamoulian" hotel Marrakech, Morocco. What are you doing here... in Morocco? I surely didn't get here by chance... - What more do you want from me?! - Absolutely nothing. You were exonerated from all charges, don't be afraid. I'm here only as a friend Sure... If only I could believe you You must believe me. I give you my word. Come out. Let's have a drink together, and you'll convince yourself. I don't know why, but you seem changed in what concerns me... Changed? I don't see why. I don't seem to understand. Explain me, better, Miss. There's something more human, softer in your eyes. A woman can sense that right away. Thank you. Now, in spite of everything, I think I am able to show you I like you. - Really? - Yes. - Thank you. It's hot. What do you think, should I trim my hair? - No, don't. You?d lose all your charm. - I would? And, still, one day you said: "I should fleece that judge like a sheep!" - O, you found out about that! - Yes. - Garcon, deux tropicales, s'il vous plait - Oui, madame. Merci. Since you deem me innocent, I'm wondering why're you looking for me so persistently? Some people, journalists, colleagues, and even my wife, have implied I'm prosecuting you because, unconsciously, I'm every attracted by you. And what do you think? Well... I've scrupulously tried plumbing the depths... .. of my soul's recesses, but, nothing, I found nothing to be ashamed of. Briefly, what do you want to say? That during all those interrogatories you've never wanted me? During the interrogatories, no, but, incidentally, I have to admit that when... .. asleep at night I dreamt of a woman who got into my bed and stuck to my body, I could feel her breasts crushed on my chest! And I was that woman? The body was that of a cousin of mine who became a nun, but that bright face was categorically yours. Please, go on. Gladly, my dear. Waking up one morning after having had one of those dreams, I realized that a man... .. would have offered you any sum of money to feel the emotions that... .. that I had had for free, during the whole night! That's exactly what happened to your friend Parisi. Wanting to spend a night with me he sent me that famous note with the 300,000,000 offer you always misunderstood - True. - D'you want one? - O thank you. - 300 million that then became 600, true? - Exactly. Tell me, please... why have you always turned down the offers? I was always raising the sum - in order to get set for life. - I understand. But maybe I refused because I was falling in love with anther man... A married man from whom I can't ask nothing. Do you want to know his name? - No, he's man is already suffering enough - And are we to let him suffer? Iris... - It's all about a choice he made... - What are you saying? How come his choice?! I want to take him out of that cell before it's too late! What cell?! - It must be a mistake! Isn't it about me? - What have you got to do with it?! I fell in love with Enrico Patellaro, the TV journalist, who's now wearing himself out in prison because of you! O... O my God, a sunstroke! O God! Forgive me... A little water! Is anything the matter? - No, I'm fine. - How can I get Enrico out of prison? What?... Enrico, she says... Please forgive this small blockage... - Only Parisi can help your Enrico. - Why Parisi? Because Parisi knows the truth about the bribes... His confession would help many innocents out of prison, but he's disappeared. I know where he is. He took refuge in Spain, I even know his phone number. Only you could have known where he had hidden. That's what I was hoping for... That's why I came in Morocco after you If in his amorous delirium he got to offering 600,000,000 for a night with him, it means he's ready to run any risk in order to come to you. So, we've nailed him! - Have I made myself clear? - Yes, perfectly - Now I understand why you came here. - That's it. This is his latest phone number. - Great. - Shall we try it? - Of course, let's try it. - Hi. it's me. - Hi, my love, how are you? - Fine. Listen, how much longer will be good this phone number? I'm leaving tonight. I'll call you afterwards. I don't trust anyone. - "What if I wanted to see you?" - But, if I want to see you, - what do I do? - If... if you've really decided to see me - we can meet even tonight! - Where? No matter where, I'll send the plane! In less than an hour you're here. It's a splendid place! An oasis, a true lovers' nest! But I have to sing tonight! You know how much I love my work. I can't come! You come here! Come on! - Come! - It's dangerous in Morocco. Yes, I know, but there are so many small airports nearby... - Come on, you come! - OK. I should have some friends around there. Let me think. - If there're any problems, I'll call you, OK? - Alright, I'm waiting for you. Do you think he'll come? You were right. He'll come. - Bonsoir. - Bonsoir, monsieur. - Vous avez une pr?notation? - I am Emilio Parisi. J'ai une pr?notation. Room 301, adjoining the room of Miss Iris Del Monte. Votre passeport. Signez votre nom. - Allez, voila. - Merci. - Garcon, la cle. - Merci. Ici "Mamoulian. Corrado Parisi est arriv?. Il est a I'hotel. You told me: "It's for life. " But I knew it'd end up one day. I knew you'd go back to her. And then, that day came. I know it. I feel it. Don't say you love me. Don't say anything. Let me dream a little more. Please! Just stay here a little longer... .. close to me. And then... farewell. C'est vrai, monsieur. Yes, I know her. She's a well-liked girl, she sings well, nice body, natural gifts one can't buy... Hey! Corrado! - Surprised? - You used the girl to trap me? I did. There was no need to, I'd have come even if you had called. Sorry, but I don't think you?d have. There's an arrest warrant in your name. As a matter of fact I don't understand how come you're so at ease. - You proved yourself a true friend. - True friend, you say? But I issued the warrant for your arrest... Of course, but your colleagues were watching you, you had to do it. You must be joking. It's true the prosecutor interrogated you, and I knew everything, but, had I been alone, I'd have arrested you anyway, you know? But, my Annibale, you didn't arrest me, you did things the way a friend does, You sent the police at 3 AM to give me the time to run away. That's what you think, but you're wrong, You're a real fox! There?re things you do, not talk about them. - A, c'est bon! - Oui, madame. Good! What is it? See how nice it is, the three of us here? Yes, it is nice. Have a prune, traitor, and may you choke on it. Don't give me that look, I was joking! I'm generous, I've already forgiven you. If I used her to make you come here, don't misunderstand me, it was to ask you important questions, that I know, as a friend, you'll answer. When they arrest you, I'm afraid you won't ever speak. Forget it, I haven't gone to prison yet. Not you, but many innocents have, others are about to. You know it all, help them. Tell me then what you want to know. I want to know if the Minister took the bribe. Well... I offered him the bribe. You understand, I went roundabout, talking about cake, slices, golf clubs... - And how did he take it? - How? - He got scared and refused. - The main thing is he refused! Now, let's talk about Enrico Patellaro, the TV journalist. Oh, he's pure! When I started talking about slices and bribes he covered his ears and got out of the room! Thanks, Corrado. With this statement the Minister will be exonerated of all charges And you also make someone here present happy, because her love, Enrico Patellaro, will soon get out of jail. Patellaro?! But wasn't she in love with you? No, you got it wrong. She's in love with Patellaro. O, now I understand! It's because of him you were refusing me! Well done for our Iris! Poor girl! Another mistake: she fell for a pure man. That one'll never leave his wife for you. Don't worry, my little one! You'll see that a nice cherub will make you forget many things. Cheers! Now that you've got what you wanted, what do you plan on doing? What can I plan? Go back to Rome and resume my work. - Still a 1,500,000 a month. - Yes. Why? What do you mean? I thought you'd work for me. It'd be a total! No limits to what you'd earn. No. You're a briber. You bribed bankers, politicians, people of the cloth, even this poor girl. But, don't you try it on me, Corrado! You haven't got a chance! First look at the amount, then answer me. - What are you writing? - Wait! The best is now! This is only an advance. Take it. 300,000,000? And this is the advance? You always try! Some nerve you have! Corrado, I'm a judge, I could accuse you of attempted bribery! You know that's a charge even more serious than your other ones? - May I? Who is it? I am an Interpol police commissioner. Who among you is Mr Parisi? He is. Annibale! You're under arrest! That's what you do... I had told you, Corrado, that I was going to arrest you. I'm sorry for you, Annibale. I'm mixed in too big things. And me, I was tricked once again! You made a mistake. You shouldn't have done it, you'll realize that. Come, sir. Congratulations, sir. You came early. - Show me your passport, please. - Yes. I'm judge Salvemini, the magistrate that signed the arrest warrant. What's with this cherub? An explicit bribery attempt by the accused The young lady was a witness. Aside from her, what're you doing in here, having dinner with the accused? What do you mean aside from her?! It's with her help that I've lured Corrado Parisi in here to arrest him! I'm sorry for you. It was the hotel manager who phoned us, informing about Parisi's arrival. - I know. I and the manager had agreed on it. Dottor Salvemini, I'm very happy for your success, but I should get the merits for arresting Mr Parisi, before anyone else! I understand, commissioner, that this is a very important capture for your career, but, when you'll write your report, I'd like to be also present, to make absolutely clear what was my contribution to this operation. - OK. I'll be waiting for you in my office - Here's your passport. - Thank you. And the check? - I'll add it to the file to prove the attempted bribery. - Alright. We'll meet at your office to arrange for the extradition, so to avoid errors. Don't worry, dottor Salvemini, all will be done with the utmost precision. - Tres bien. - Bonsoir, monsieur le juge. - Bonsoir, monsieur le commisaire. Then, it wasn't you who denounced him? Of course I did! I had made arrangements for him to be arrested tomorrow at dawn. But the hotel manager made a mistake. A small glitch. A small glitch that cost me 600,000,000! Happy now? Miss, I told you, the engine of justice is slow to start, but, when it starts moving, is unpredictable. No one can stop it, and it catches up with you wherever you are, and when you less expect it. Might be, but one thing's sure: whenever we meet, I'm the one who always gets it! Good morning, captain. How did you know I was coming? Thank you for having come to pick me up. - I've come to take you to the tribunal. - Why there? The president of the tribunal wants to see you right away. The suitcases. - Thank you. - This one also. - I'll carry it, if you don't mind. - No, you're tired, give it to him. - To the policeman? - Yes, please. - Take it. Is that alright? - Please. - Yes. I've understood. From the Interpol report... .. it results you lodged at the "Mamoulian" hotel .. in the company of operator Corrado Parisi and of his... .. suspected accomplice, Miss Iris Del Monte. Yes, Mr President, that's how it happened. Using the sexual instinct as a bait, I was successful in luring Corrado Parisi at that gorgeous hotel, and getting him arrested by the Interpol! The terrible but all so human suspicion we'd all want to be delivered of, is that, in a moment of frustration, far away from your country, you tried, once again, to save your dear friend. One again?! Mr President, after all it is true that, after my arrival in Morocco, - Corrado Parisi was arrested! - We are amazed... .. that a magistrate so experienced like you are... .. can resort to these small subterfuges! What subterfuges?! In his report, the Interpol commissioner stated not having got any call from you... .. and having acted on information from the hotel manager. Mr President, I admit to having used a small subterfuge, it's true, but, in substance if not in form, I maintain I was acting in good faith. The good faith, dottor Salvemini, can be proven by the capacity of resisting the offers... .. made by that skillful briber, who is your friend Parisi. I've always resisted, Mr President! But not till the last moment! When the commissioner made the arrest, you were dinning with the accuse who had just given you... .. this 300,000,000 cherub! Fortunately, Miss Iris Del Monte was present at that scene... .. and she can testify that I refused that cherub! Because of her past and because of her involvement in the bribes case, Miss Del Monte is not a trustworthy witness. If anything, her presence at that dinner is an aggravating circumstance! An aggravating circumstance?! Mr President, how can you doubt a judge with an untarnished past like I am?! Untarnished until you've run into... .. your friend Parisi. And the... Cote d'Azur weekends, original paintings as gifts... It's a worthless print, Mr President. We had it appraised, that print... It's an authentic Picasso, worth 200,000,000! An authentic Picasso?! 200,000,000?! You are too much of an expert in painting to not discern a print from an original And if we connect this with the arrest warrant for Parisi... .. to be enforced at 3 AM in order to give the friend time to prepare his escape... No, Mr President. I've never accepted Parisi's offers, nor those of his accomplices, no offer except... that small incident... that small painting that I... .. I didn't know how I could, yes... maybe... I should've given it a closer look... .. I should have... yes, have it appraised... to understand that... I didn't understand that, Mr President! I thought it was a worthless print! I was at home... and was just saying: "Should I cut my hair?" and my daughter says: "No, father, not the hair!" and the painting says: "Put it... put it... You are very tense. Relax. - Unwind. - Yes. I also always say: "Relax! Unwind!". The thing is, Mr President, I'm used to interrogate, not to answer. Well, now, answer. Could you tell me the meaning of this number we found in your office drawer: "Mariotti, UBS, 263544". Of course. "Mariotti, 263544". It's the phone number of that fatso that... .. I had the bad luck of getting acquainted with before he became a suspect No! It is not a phone number! Think better. "U-B-S" - "UBS"? - Union Bank of Switzerland. Union... Bank... of Switzerland... An account opened in your name at the Lugano branch, only days after the investigation went into your hands. In this account was paid, in three consecutive deposits, the sum of $200,000. DM 100,000, 100.000 Swiss francs. Do you understand what this means? Yes, Mr President. They made a basket for me! A basket, or a station wagon as these operators call it in their jargon. But, Mr President, about these baskets, these "gardens", I don't know anything! We'd want to believe you, dottor Salvemini, but because of the serious suspicions piled against you we're forced... ...to put in motion a judiciary inquest. Gentlemen. I admit having committed a few naiveties and some excess of initiative, but... .. everything I did... .. I only did it in order to free from prison... .. those innocents. The terrible experience is now over, and I don't wish it to no one! The great friendship and solidarity you have shown me. - We're going on in 4 seconds, Enrico. - Alright. - Ready. - Go! Ladies and gentlemen, here I am again at my job unfortunately, as everyone knows, after a long period of protective custody. Excuse me. The news. After long, stressful, humiliating interrogatories, judge Salvemini... .. suffers from amnesia. His by now diminished mental capacities didn't allow him to defend himself with the needed lucidity from the accusations operator Parisi and the other repented criminals pile up on him. In his desperate defense, he managed to exculpate a few suspected persons, the undersigned among them, a Minister in the Cabinet and the, by now, famous singer and showgirl Iris Del Monte, who, due to her sudden popularity, has signed a staggering contract with a private TV, while judge Salvemini's position... .. is crumbling. About the mentioned magistrate, the media is split between presenting him to the public as an untarnished judge... .. and a dangerous for the society person. Everyday, judge Salvemini is accompanied by the police to the tribunal... .. to be submitted to new and every day more harsh interrogatories. - Mr Salvemini we were waiting for you. - Please, sir... - Judge... - Good morning. Judge after all your misadventures, do you still have faith in justice? After my recent, bitter experiences, I'm asking myself if it's still useful to invest so much energy in law enforcing, or if, instead, giving up empty hopes and never rewarded expectations, we should accept injustice as a rule, and not as an exception, this with the hope, obviously, that at least injustice will be equal for all. Excuse me, gentlemen, but I'm an accused. The judges are waiting for me. Thank you.
