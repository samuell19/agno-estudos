Let's go! - A group of seemingly loved-up couples-- - I love you, baby. - Are moving in together and will play the ultimate game of deception. - Let the games begin. [all cheering] - While some are real couples in real relationships-- - I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. - Hidden among them are liars. - Are you guys thinking us? - Oh, [bleep]. narrator: Fake couples determined to swindle the lovers out of a massive cash prize. - Jake told me that they were talking about you guys being a fake couple. - What's going on here? All you've done is lie, lie, lie. - The couples will compete in activities designed to test their relationships and unearth suspicions. - Can you sniff out your partner's pit? [laughs] - Oh! - It was the most unconvincing kiss I've ever seen. - Each night at the Truth Ceremony, the couples will have to vote off who they think is lying about their love. - Give them a few minutes to think of the next lie. - You don't fake this [bleep], bro. - I have never met anyone as snakey in my whole life. We trusted in you so much that we voted our friends. - [gasps] - Clearly, you are trusting the wrong people. Each time they get it right, the prize fund grows by $25,000, but kick out a real couple-- - What? - What the hell, you guys? - Be aware that backstabbing will be happening. - And the prize fund stays the same. - You guys really think that we're fake? - Are you kidding? At the first Truth Ceremony, the couple that received the most votes was... - Riani and Chantz. - Chantz and Riani. - Riani and Chantz. - Damn, damn, damn. - But were they real or fake? both: We are...

I will see you tomorrow. - ♪♪ I'll be the last one standing ♪♪ - The big reveal tonight was that Chantz is actually gay. - No one suspected that I was gay. - Everyone said they had a really great friendship, but notably, most of the couples said they didn't see a chemistry there as lovers. During the ceremony, they wouldn't look me in the eye and I always, like, grew up thinking, you know, if people don't look you right in the eye, they're hiding something. both: We are...liars. [cheering] - I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. - So happy for all the remaining couples because they already have 25k in the prize fund.
