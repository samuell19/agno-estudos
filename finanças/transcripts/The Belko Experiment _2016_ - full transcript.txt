Listen, listen. No. Greg, no! I need those files this morning. Come on, man. You can't be that lazy. It's not my fault. Made myself! Made myself! Yeah, made yourself. That's great. Very impressive. Made myself! Come on, man! What's going on? Is there a bomb threat or something? Who are you? Where's Wilmar? ID, please. You're kidding? Here you go. Why are they sending that man home? Open the trunk, please. Okay. Here's your company ID. Make sure they spelled everything correctly. Mmm-hmm. Company credit card. Company telephone. Keys to your company car. It's a Honda, in Section H, Westside of the lot. And, last but not least, keys to your new apartment. I got you a corner. You have the address, correct? Yeah. Yes. Okay, and you saw the doctor yesterday? For the tracer, you mean? It's for your own protection. There's dozens of kidnappings every year here in Colombia, usually from companies like ours. But, with that sucker, they can locate you anywhere, anytime, no problem. Hmm. Bogot√° treating you good so far? Yeah. Don't be scared, Dany. Belko likes the transition of its homespun employees to go as smooth as possible. So, if you have any questions whatsoever, just come to me or Raziya here, okay? Hi. In English? Sure. Belko is a non-profit organization that facilitates American companies in South America in the hiring of American workers. What the fuck is that? It's a little corn cob dude. Mike, it looks like someone's eaten off of it. It's a gift for you. No. Here. Let's put him right here. Ew! That's disgusting. I don't want it. It's good luck. He wards off werewolves. Maybe it'll work on Wendell. Asshole. My God! The man just does not get it. Hey, what? Maybe we should slow things down. Mike, I'm barely divorced. Got married too young. No, I got married too stupid. And I'm not any smarter. Oh, that's great for me then! Mr. Norris. Hey, Barry. Mike. Leandra, will you set up that Caracas call for 2:00? I'll put it through. PowerPoint files from these documents in two hours, please. All right? What? Uh, yes. Okay. Two hours. I'm Roberto. I'm Dany. Leota, will you stop being a bitch and introduce yourself? You're an ass, Roberto. I've already introduced myself. Yeah. And we're going to be friends and we're going to ostracize you. She doesn't even know to spell "ostracize." Oh! Cute, no? I don't know. He's a little too normal for me. Honey, normal people do not work at Belko. Oh, Keith. One's loose. Oh, shit. Okay, all right, here I come. Tickles. Oh, yeah. Obviously, that's John. Oh, although, he prefers to be called Jake. He thinks it makes him sound tough. Well, he looks very, very tough. He thinks you're very pretty. Honey, believe me. One more bad date, and I am there. Oh, guard your heart. He's a total "love 'em and leave 'em" kind of guy. Just 'cause he has a very short lifespan. He doesn't have commitment issues. Hi, Mike. Hey, how are you? Terry, where is everybody? I don't know, mate. They sent all the locals home at the gate. Mmm, Mike. Next time, you got to come with us to the rain forest. Check it out. The bats let you come right up and stroke 'em. The kids were in heaven. Wow. Next time, buddy, yeah? Yeah, totally. Looks like fun. Security. Hey, Evan, it's, uh, Mike Milch up in systems. Yes, sir. Hey, uh, who sent all the Colombian nationals home? Central. They sent me an email this morning saying there was some kind of security concerns. I figure somebody made some threats somewhere and got 'em all worked up. Who are those new guards? I don't know. They ain't friendly, though. They got some big-ass dogs. Yeah. You have any idea why they would be heading into that old hangar next door? I don't know, man. I'll check it out. All employees, no matter what you're doing, please stop and lend me your full attention. Hey, it's Jesus! Shh! There are currently 80 of you in the building. What is that? Intercom? Do we have an intercom? In eight hours, most of you will be dead. Your chance of survival increases by following my orders, and excelling at the tasks I place before you. Your first task is simply this. Murder any two of your fellow employees within the next half hour. How they are killed, or how they are chosen to be killed, is of no consequence. But if there are not two dead bodies in the building within 30 minutes, you will face repercussions. What the... Not a clue. Hey, all the lines are dead. What did that man say? He wanted us to kill each other? Panicking is not gonna help anybody, Agnes. Calm down, it's okay. Anything? No. Nothing. Calmly, we need to evacuate the floor. Mikey, come on. It's a joke, man. Yeah, probably, yeah. But still. Okay. Break time. Hey, let's not take the elevator, okay? Let's use the stairs. Why? It's less risky. We're all gonna die. Hey, where you going? What was that? What's that noise? Just go. Head on down, okay? Mike, come on. I'll be right there. Hey, are you trying the police? Yeah. Reception's usually fine here. What in bloody hell? Wendell! Wendell? Wendell, you're gonna break your foot. No! How is this connected to the security check this morning? I don't know, sir! God damn it! I just validate, okay? Hey, Bud. What do you think, Mikey? What's this all about? I don't know. You think you got a way to get through it? Blowtorch could do the job, but I don't know how thick it is. It could take a while. What if we try cutting through one of the walls first? Wouldn't it be easier to try to get through cement than get through whatever that is? No, no, no. This metal surrounds the entire building. So the whole building's covered? Yeah. It's worth a shot, though, right? The blowtorch? It's worth a try. I'll make a call. Hey, where you guys going? Roof. See if we can get someone's attention. Got anything? Still nothing. Thought we'd get a shot here in the lobby, but... Can you guys stick around for me? Oh, that's great. Like I didn't already feel trapped in this job. Hey, listen up, everybody, okay? I'm Barry Norris, the COO here, for people who don't know. Listen, I'm aware that this is a very... Hell, to say the least, a very strange situation here. But I don't believe there's any cause for panic. All right? We're still trying to figure out exactly what the situation is, but I'm certain there's a rational explanation. This is a government building. We think maybe somebody put precautions in place in case of a military event. Obviously these walls. Now, someone has clearly discovered this feature, and they're having a little fun at our expense. Okay? Whoever's doing this, the object is to get all of you upset. So let's not play into that, okay? Let's just remain calm, chill out, and take a few minutes to figure out exactly what's happening, okay? So, thank you. I'm gonna go work on that. And I'll circle back to you as soon as I can. Thanks, everybody. So, someone's just taking the piss. Right? Hey, what's up? Are you smoking pot? What? We just had our lives threatened and you come up to hang out? That dude on the speakers? Please. That shit's hilarious. You guys are insane for smoking pot at Belko. They test here. They'll fire you, you know. It's from Panama, man. It's not that strong. It isn't. I know. It ain't melting at all, Bud. No, no, look. It ain't even hot. What? Feel it. Feel it. I've never seen anything like that. Do you know what kind of metal this is? Mmm. I don't really know. Barry. Sorry, this is rude. Damn hot with all these bodies. Yeah. Um, I think that they turned the air conditioning off. Hey, Wendell. Yo! Can I get one of those? 100%. Hey, listen. It's great that you calmed everybody down, but, um, I don't think this is a prank. No? No, I mean, these walls, they seem designed to keep people in just as much as out. There's no cell reception. That's not an easy thing to accomplish. Those new guards this morning? I saw one of them heading over to that old hangar that's next door. So my guess is that is where they're set up. So what are you saying? We should pick out a couple folks to kill? No, no. Not at all. That was a joke, Mike. Yeah. I mean, I know. Um, but I'm not sure how much people are gonna be joking if something else happens. Something like what? Something. Listen, Mike. In a situation like this, it's normal for a handful of folks to panic and overreact. Would you agree with that? Sure. So why don't you consider that you might be one of those people? All right? I brought some bottled water from the cafeteria. Why don't you guys grab yourselves some? Not getting jack up here, either. God damn it. Keith! I see one! Who? Right there! Look! In the window. The security guard from this morning. Hey! Hey! - Hello! - Help us! We're stuck! We're trapped! - Help us, please! - Come on, man! Hey! Hey! Hey! What the fuck? You guys, quit getting so worked up. I'm sorry. What, man? Bro, did you even happen to read what you signed when you started working for this place? We gave these fuckers the right to do practically whatever the fuck they wanted to do to us. Oh, kill us? No, dude. It's a psychological fucking test, man. They wanna see how we'll react to this bullshit. Look at me. Look how fucking chill I am. They lose, man. I fucking win. So just relax and take the day off, man. Consider it a present from corporate fucking America. Oh, my God! What the fuck? Somebody's shooting! Get down. Jesus! Shit! No, Mr. Norris. Be careful! No. It's okay. What the hell? That's not a bullet wound. What are you doing? What the... The bone... Jesus. His head exploded from the inside. What? The tags. When we start working here, they put tracers. They implanted them in the back of our heads. For insurance. - What if they're rigged to explode? - What? That's why the locals were sent home. They don't have them. Wait, Mike! Lonny... Hey, stop. Don't cry. Okay? Take this. Watch my back, yeah? Mmm-hmm. Give me a duke. Okay. Come on, let's go. Mike. Mike, where are you going? Mike! What are you doing, Mike? What's happening? Is it okay? Please. I can help you look for something. What's happening? What are you doing? Mike. What's happening? What's going on? Did they catch him? I don't know. Fuck. Mike. Mike, open the door! Mike! Mike! Michael Milch, set down the knife immediately, or we will detonate the explosive. Mike! Mike, please! Mr. Milch, we will give you 10 seconds to cease and desist. Open the door, Mike! Ten. Nine. Eight. Mike, open the door! Seven. Six. Five. Four. Mike! Three. Two. Fuck. Oh, my God, Mike! What in God's name is wrong with you? Shit! It's okay, honey. Okay, okay, okay. Hey. What's the ice for? You gonna build a snowman or what? It dulls the pain as he gets stitched up. Oh... What is that? Is that your boyfriend? This Mike guy? Because, obviously, Leandra, your parents never had a conversation with you about mixed messages. What? Leandra, admit it. Don't you understand? I've clocked every single one of the looks that you give me. Looks? Yeah, the flirtatious emails, I come. Fuck off! You can do it, Mike. The fucking world is falling apart. Seriously, Mike, what were you thinking? Here. Are you okay? Yeah. There's three cameras in the bathroom alone. They've been watching every bloody thing that we do. Hey, Evan. Here, man, have some water. Me and Lawrence, we came over here together, man. He never did nothing to nobody. Just a dumb-ass kid, man. Every time he got pussy, he thought he was in love. I'm sorry about your friend. Hey, listen. You have the key to that armory, right? Where the guards keep their weapons? Anybody else have keys besides you? No. I mean, maybe them ones outside. Mmm. I think I should hold on to those keys. You think you should what? I think I should hold on to them. Make sure they're safe. Come on, you know I can't do that, sir. I'm your boss, Evan. Okay, then I quit. All right. I think it's best I hold on to these keys until somebody lets me out of that fucking door. Don't worry, I ain't gonna give them to nobody. Thanks for the water. Did you get it all off? Is it all off of me? Hold on, doll. They're trying to freak us out by shutting down the air-co, man. That's their plan, right, Bud? Right, Bud? Hmm? Do you think it is, Bud? Do you think that's their plan? I don't know, Lonny. She's down, all right. How can you tell? I can hear it, man. The pilot's off. Everything. Did they do it? I don't know if they did it or not. But we're gonna fix it. They're trying to break us down so that we start killing each other, Bud. You just need to relax, all right? Hmm? I hope by now we've demonstrated that we aren't blindly bluffing. This game's a real one. Each of you are deep inside it. You can choose to follow our directives, or not. Either way, you'll be giving us the results we're looking for. Fuck you, man! You are mostly free to do as you please. However, you must not dismantle any more cameras. And you must not remove the tag from your body. Next time we will not provide a countdown as we did Mr. Milch. If you break either of these rules, your life will abruptly end. There are currently 76 of you left in the building. The time is now 12:47 pm. Listen! By 2:47 pm, in two hours, we want 30 of you dead through whatever means necessary. If 30 of you are not dead, we will end 60 of your lives through our own methods. Christ! Begin. Fuck you! Fuck you! Calm down! Everybody calm down! Slow down, everybody. Hey, hey, Lonny, it's gonna be okay... Get back off me! Whoa! Don't look at me like that, man. Move. Wendell, what are you... Wendell, stop. Guys, guys, please. What are you guys doing? Why are you getting those? Listen, asshole! Where are you going? I'm just going to find a quiet place to hide. Come on! Ah! Jesus! What did you do that for? This shit is hooked up to the fire department, Chet. They'll hear it and come get us. Everybody calm down! The last thing we need to do is lose our cool. Knock it off! Come on! Dickhead! Now come on out here and let's discuss this. Raven, what are you doing? I'm protecting myself, Michael. Guys, come on! Cut it out, please! Evan, does the fire alarm alert the station or is it a self-enclosed system? It's just us. Can you turn it off? What is that? Lonny, calm down, man! It's just a fire alarm. No, it's not. They're trying to make us kill each other. Easy, cowboy. Chill out, man! Hey, come here. Get back! Whoa! Wait a second. What just happened? Hold on. Uh... Wait, wait. Something is happening. I'm so sorry, Bud! I didn't see anything. Okay? Stop! I'm just gonna go, okay? Bud, he fell down and he hit his head. It's okay. I should go. He tried to grab me. Shh! Wait, wait! God damn it! Now, please, stop putting words in my mouth. I'm sorry, but that sounds to me like you're saying you wanna kill innocent people. No, I am not saying that at all. I'm saying that we need to discuss all our options. We understand. But we are not going to entertain the option of killing people. We? What? Do you got a mouse in your pocket there, Milch? - Mr. Norris has a point. - Absolutely he does. But we have to think about what is best for the whole group. All right, look. I know no one wants to actually think about sacrificing 30 lives. But if it means saving the lives... No, uh-uh, fuck that. Consider it as a fucking option. It does not matter what the circumstances are. We do not have the right to take innocent human lives. And besides that, there are practical reasons. Like what? You can't really think that they're gonna let anybody live to tell about this. This is not going to stop after we kill 30 people. Maybe not, but it would buy us time to figure out another solution. I can't even believe you're considering this, Barry. Vince, we cannot pretend things aren't what they are. I might have an idea. We can... We can go up to the roof and put banners up there letting every car that comes by know that we're in here. That way, nobody gets hurt. We should try that. Leandra, this isn't a pep rally. We are in the middle of nowhere, the road traffic is next to nothing. The driveway's, like, half a mile long. People need to see these banners. Then they have to call the cops, who have to then get here, all in less than two hours. Do you have a better idea? Yeah, jerking off into a cup is a better goddamn idea. Oh, there's something I can do. 75% of us will die if it doesn't work. Okay, no disrespect intended, Barry, but some would fare better than others if this was turned into a cage match. What the hell does that mean? That means not all of us are Special Forces trained to kill. Are you questioning my integrity? I've read both your files. Hey, hey! Come on! Nobody is questioning anything. But we need to work together to get the hell out of here, right? I suggest we try the banners, okay? See if it works. In the meantime, if anybody else comes up with anything better, then we'll go for that. And how long will that take? We can do it in 30 minutes. It's worth trying, Norris. Come on, let's go. We won't know unless we try. Can we sit in and talk about this? People! We got to live in reality. We're just wasting time. We don't have time. There was no... I can't fucking... God damn it! Terry. What? You have kids, right? Yes. What's your conscience telling you here? What? Who are you beholden to first and foremost? I mean, these people, they're our friends, right? Right. But if you're like me... My wife and kids need me. I don't know what they'll do without me. Yeah. We have to be bold here. This isn't the time for timidity. You agree? Yes. Hey! It's in the fucking water, man. What is? Some sort of fucking psychotropic fucking chemical or something, man! It's making us all on fucking edge. We're on edge because they just killed four people, Marty! Dude! Dude! I'm protecting us, motherfucker. That's gonna get moldy. Mike. Mike. Mike! God, Mike, enough! Enough what? Listen. Don't be fucking mad at me just because I thought that we should have an open mind. Oh, an open mind? An open mind about killing people? I did not want to kill people, but we need to discuss things. It is not a discussion. It is needling each other into these bullshit rationalizations. And the circumstances do not alter what is right and what is wrong. Evan, would you give me a hand with this, please? Thanks. Evan? Where's that blowtorch that was here? It's not there anymore. Hey. Hey! Wendell! Hold up. Milch? What are you doing? This is where security keeps the weapons. Yeah, I know. We're getting them out of here. Why? Because it's important we keep them safe. All right? We don't want someone coming in here and just breaking in. Evan here won't give us the keys. So. Go ahead, Wendell. I don't think that's wise. I think the weapons are safe to stay exactly where they are. Quite honestly, Mike, I don't give a fuck what you think. That was foolish. Look, man, he's right. Y'all can't do this. You don't need no more weapons in here. I'm gonna shove this down your goddamn... Whoa! Hey, chill, man. Lower your gun. Lower that gun, man. Come on. Who the hell do you think you are? Not much, man, but don't try me, I'm on fucking edge! Listen, son, we just wanna make sure these weapons are safe, all right? Shut the fuck up! I swear to God, I'm two seconds away from blowing a hole in your ugly, motherfucking face! Hey, look at me, man. Look at me! You had a hard day, right? You saw your friend get killed. Come on, man. I know, I know. But you don't wanna do this, okay? You don't wanna do this. Put it down. It's gonna be okay, man. Just let me handle it, okay? It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Let's go. Well, there. Jesus, Mike! Let's go. Yeah. You know what, Mike? That was a stupid fucking move. We're gonna need help. That was hardcore, bro. Oh, shit! They know who they fucking with now! Evan, you wanna just blow him and get it over with? Damn. What? What? Yeah, and then we attach with those and stuff like that. Mike, where have you been? Uh, we ran into some problems. Hey, everybody. Listen up, okay? You need to look out for Norris, Terry and Wendell Dukes, all right? Um, they're working against us here, okay? Yeah, now especially. Hey, we need that rope. We're gonna be done here in 20 seconds. It's not really up to the standards I'd like but... It's beautiful, it's not a contest. Come on. Here we go. Really? I'm trying to make these things pop. You want us to be saved, right? You can put the finishing touches when they're hanging on the side of the building. The fuck are you doing, Mike? Hmm? Are you trying to get killed? What? What? Mike, you don't antagonize those types of people. Seriously, I'm just starting to think you're stupid. Hey, hey, hey. Fuck you! What? For saying, "Hey, hey, hey"? No, because you need to be realistic, Mike. Everyone here is afraid for their lives. And at that point, whatever you think is right or wrong goes out the fucking window. It's human nature. At the end of the day, people are out for themselves. You're driving me crazy. Let's just go take care of this, okay? Okay. Hey, Mike. We're ready now. And, uh, obviously, we all just heard your whole conversation. Just so you know. You know it's not a separate room, it's just a cubicle. Maybe we'll just get going. Yeah, let's go. For what it's worth, I thought he was totally out of line saying "hey" like that. Did you drink any? We're doing you a favor. Move, assholes! Shit! We can hang them from here. Roll them out. Tie the corners in knots. Tie the ropes to the corners. Got it. Yeah? Oh, fuck. Keith, don't stop. Keep going, come on! No, Keith, don't! Come on! Help me! Mike, stop! Mike! MIKE: Come on! We almost got it! Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Watch it! Look out! Jesus Christ! Misspelled "hangar." Mike, what are you doing? We have to try again. What and get shot? Please cease and desist hanging the notices off the side of the building. If another attempt is made, the explosive in the offender's head will be detonated. Fuck! Mike, look out! Mike, stop! Mike, stop it! Get down. Mike, what the hell? No, we can do it! I can. Come on! Stop! Can you hear me? Stop it! Do you hear me? Do you hear me? What is wrong with you? Do you hear me? Come on. Yeah. Mike, are you okay? You can't save everyone, Mike. So what are you saying? Hmm? That we just do what they say? I don't know. Who the fuck are these people? I don't know, Leandra. I've been thinking. This job... What is it? I mean, this location. Out in the middle of nowhere. That never made any sense. This building, it's like it was designed for just this purpose. They've had these tags in us for over a year. Mike, you're saying that the government's the one that's doing this? That's who we work for. No. Think about it. They've never seemed to give a shit about the work that we actually do. For the past year, they've just had us running in circles like hamsters on a fucking treadmill. There's no way, Mike. There's no way. What if the only reason that we've been here all along, because of this? I don't know, some kind of human experiment. Mike, listen to me. Do you hear me? That's impossible, okay? Impossible. Look at me. We're gonna be okay. Now we should go. Let's go. Hey. Just was looking out, in case them ones come back. Yeah. My mother never wanted me to move to Bogot√° for this job. Back of my head will be blown off and the first thing she'll say is, "I told you." Mike! You stay! You stay! Norris, what are you doing? Leandra, you listen to me, all right? This guy is putting us all in danger. He's gonna get a lot of people killed. Terry. Terry, come on, he's your friend. Yes, I know. That's part of the reason why. He's not being rational, is he? Keys. You want the fucking keys? What the fuck are you doing? He threw the keys! What, stabbing him is going to make them fly up the fucking stairs? You shut up. He had to get it anyway. What do I do? What do I do? She can't stay here. Fuck! Get the fuck off of me, you pin-eyed pervert! Don't you call me a pervert! I'm not a pervert. Chill out, Wendell. Come on. I said, come on! I'm sorry, Evan. Give them one mag a piece. Why do you keep the rest? Because I'm the one that's gonna do this. Do what? Isn't that what we decided? Do what? There's too many guns. It doesn't make sense. He put them here. Who put them here? Our new god. Okay, like we discussed. Everybody down in the lobby. And then what? Calm down, calm down. Look, come on, use your brains... Somebody grab the keys. Everybody, stay where you are! Don't fucking move! What the fuck! Come on, let's move! Come on, let's go! Fucking move, man. Let's go! Guys, come on! Come on, man. Fucking move! I'm not babysitting here. Don't worry about it. You'll find out when we get there. Just get your ass down the stairs. Can I have your attention, please? I'm gonna need everyone with children under the age of 18 to step forward. Why? Barry, you can't do that! Quickly, quickly, quickly. Excuse me, sir. Sir, sir. I send money home to my, uh, parents every month for my little brother. Is your little brother made out of your sperm, cocksucker? No. Then shut the fuck up! Get back! Everybody, back! Everybody, step back. It's gonna help us a lot. We don't have a lot of time. So this will make this easier. Just step back. Good. Thank you. If this group would please stand by that wall, the west wall. Okay, good. Come on. Up against the wall. All right. Now I'm gonna need everybody over the age of 60 to please step forward. You. Come on, let's go. Perhaps you should consider this differently, yeah? We could do a lottery. People just can write their names on a scrap of paper... Don't undermine me again. Are we clear? Clear. How about you? Are you over 60? Let's go, come on! Hey, you're only doing this because of the fucking chemicals in your system. Everybody, listen up! Now I realize that this is very difficult. But it's... This is the right thing. This is the only choice we have. All right? In less than 20 minutes, they are going to kill 60 of the people in this room. So we need order. Now the next person who speaks up, who says a single word, we are unfortunately gonna put a bullet in your head. Now if this group will kindly go stand against the east wall. Go. Go, go, go. Seven people. Fuck! Okay. Him. Let's go. Her. No. Go. Her. Go. Don't touch me! Him. You, let's go. No, I'm not going! I'm not going! Let him go. Her. Please don't kill us. Him. Everyone, shut the fuck up! Turn on some music or something. Barry? What are we doing? You motherfucker! Who the fuck are you to decide who lives and dies? You will rot in hell for... That's five. Six. Turn up the fucking music! Please. Please. Seven. Hey, Terry. Terry, give me the gun. Terry, it's not too late, man. I forgive you, okay? Just give me that gun. Mike Milch is trying to get me to give him my gun, Barry. I didn't do it. Bully for you. Shoot him. No, no, Terry! Listen, to me. Look at me, Terry. No, no, no, Terry, don't! Go, go, go! Peggy! Look out. Watch out. Look out. You okay? Come on, let's go. Dany! Get in, get in. Come on, come on! Let's go. Come on, come on. Let's go. Stop! I count four more dead. Don't count, just go. Get as many as you can. Let's go, let's go. Come on. Whoever's there, show yourself. So far, you've killed 29 people. That's one short. You have two minutes remaining. If you don't kill one more person in the next 120 seconds, 30 more of you will die. Hello? No! Leandra, please, no! I was just doing what Norris told me to do. Please, I swear! I'm no danger to you, please. I'm sorry, please. I beg you. Please. Please. Please. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm sorry. You've come one body short. We're sorry to inform you that 31 employees will now be eliminated. No! It's all in my mind. Dude, get the fuck down. It's all in my mind. It's all in... It's all in my mind. It stopped! They stopped! The last stage of the game is quite simple. In one hour, whoever has killed the most people will be allowed to live. The current tally is as follows. Barry Norris, 11 kills. Wendell Dukes, seven kills. Vincent Agostino, one kill. Daniele Wilkins, one kill. Begin. Hmm. No! Don't! Wait! Vince, it's me. I'm sorry, Raziya. No, no, don't shoot. Mr. Norris. Please. Don't hurt me. I know what you want. Look, Mr. Norris. You can have me if you want. Stop. Come here. Can't waste a bullet. We have to get down. No! We don't know who it is. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
