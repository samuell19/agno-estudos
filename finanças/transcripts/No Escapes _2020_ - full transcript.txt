What do you say, sir? Time we got out? We'll all be goddamn toast in a minute. Hawk, do you copy? Hawk, this is Air. I'll be with you soon. Look at those flames jump. I've never seen anything like it. Dig in and hydrate. - Vitya. - Yes, sir. There's a way out. No flames. It's a trap, Sasha. What do you mean? Fire has its tricks. Get digging right now! Fire shelters, here. We're safer dug in under these. Chopper's on its way. Okay, now pay attention. The Forest Protection Service has fire shelters for protection. Get it off your head. This is no joke. Is this everything for Krasnoyarsk, sir? Put in a request for two B-200s as well. Okay. You wanted to see me, sir? - Hey, what's up? - Hey. What're you still doing on base? Look at this situation. I can't go out there without a sixth man. There are 100 new recruits outside. Those guys? They're a bunch of preschoolers. They need six more months at least. What's wrong with them? And what about you? How did you learn, huh? In the forest putting out fires. And they can do the same. I learned the hard way. So pick one and make a capable smokejumper out of 'em. You are an instructor, are you not? Vladimir I lost a man. I'm sad about the kid too, but we'll mourn when the season's done. Now isn't the time. I've never seen a season like this, ever. Irkutsk's burnin'. Siberia, Karelia. The whole country's up in flames. We don't have enough people and you're hangin' around here. I already told you I won't take another rookie. Get out and retire then. Get out there. Dismissed. I said dismissed. Thank you for calling. Yes, please hold. Where's Katya? - Tanya. - Huh? Where's Katya? At lunch. I see. Wait a second. You tell her dad was here, okay? - You got it. - Thank you. I can take a message if you like. Hey Tanya, who are these from? From a guy. Kinda funny-looking, wears shades, one of the new recruits. He's very handsome. "Meet me at Hangar 1" Oh no, what's that scraping noise? Wait. That's me. Are we there yet? We are now. Just like I promised. Are you serious? Let's hit the skies. But I'm on my lunch break. Don't worry. One hour is plenty. And if it isn't, you'll jump out right into the office and land right at your computer. And the parachutes? Right here. It's all been checked over. I took care of everything. Oh. Would ya look at that? Huh? Beautiful, right? Perfect for my beautiful lady. Put it on. I'll go get the pilot. Hey Pavel! Pavel! Hey, I brought another jumper along like we agreed. Stop the music. Finish your tea and let's go. Hey, where are you going? We discussed this. Come on, out. Stop checking up on me, dad. It's normal. It's called being concerned and caring. I get it. You're back, you missed me. You're worried. Who packed the parachutes, huh? Your boyfriend? - Okay, where is he? - Dad! "Dad," what? Nothing. C'mere. Where is he? Dad. Can't jump, can't fly. - I feel like Rapunzel. - Pavel's so formal. Just call me Pasha. Pasha, get over here. I never said she could fly. Pasha, get back here Just a sec. Hi there. And you are, huh? I'm Roman Ilyin. I see. - Whose unit? - Nobody's. I'm new here. Why aren't you training? Training is for amateurs. I'm a natural. Call me a - future hero of Russia. Oh, come on. Why so uptight? I'm just kidding around. Dad, this is Roman. He's-- Don't you have lunch? Go eat. Dad. Go on, have your lunch. Go on now. I just wanted to show Kat a good time. She told me she hadn't flown in years, so I pulled out a surprise. Pretty sweet of me, huh? If I see you with her again, you're going to be flying solo back home. Am I clear? Roman? Thing is I can't give you a refund. I spent it already. Spent it all already, huh? Nice running, by the way. Are you gonna stop filming me - any time soon? - Nope, never. Chowin' down alone again, Pyotr. It's called eating. Oksana. Hi, you're looking very pretty today. What do you want? Listen, be a pal and help me. It's my mom's birthday and I wrote her a postcard. I need you to check my spelling. "Dear Mama," comma. "I most likely won't be able to visit as everything's on fire." Lose the hyphen and likely has an E in it. "As soon as I can," comma. "I'll be right there with you." It's there not their. - I was in a rush. - Sergey. We're needed at Command. All right. Would you please fix it and you know, mail it? I'll bring you back some strawberries that are as big as your fist. ♪ Firefighter ♪ ♪ I was in love with you ♪ ♪ Firefighter ♪ ♪ I was in love with you ♪ Ladies, c'mon. Big smiles, big smiles.

What about my kiss? Can't you read a book or something? Eyes to yourself. A smokejumping unit comprises a minimum of six members. The unit is led by a squad leader and transported to the fire by a spotter. It's a spotter's job to assess fire type, the fire perimeter, its direction and other parameters. And why is that? Like an eagle from above, I see everything. Any questions? No questions? Dismissed. Valera. I need to fly, but I'm short a man. Take five of us, then just write down six. Alexey, six isn't just some random number. But I know you trust me and my unit. I do. I'm not writing down anything. Listen to me, half of Karelia's on fire. Why do you have to be so- No, this isn't war and I'm not taking any risks. Valera. Come on, Valera. Just this once, huh? We're done here. Sir! Gromov's saying some crazy things - about us being disbanded and you being dismissed. He says this guy's our squad leader now. What the hell? Sir? What the hell's goin' on? Hold onto your parachutes, boys. I'm not goin' anywhere. Get ready to fly. Out of the way. What are you doing? Where is he? Handsome with shades. FILE: R. ILYIN Listen, go ahead and assign him to my unit. Tanya, I'm sorry. Stop right here. The B-200 is an amphibious aircraft. It's basically a flying boat. It can carry up to 12 tons of water. - Golian, may I? - Sure. Ilyin, please stand. Call me Roman. Why did you become a smokejumper? To serve and protect. Fine. I love planes and forests, you know? Can't live without those forests. It shows. I'll take him. Go ahead. Come with me. Okay. How did you meet Katya? Well basically on the internet. We were messaging a lot, you know? You never let her go anywhere, so I kinda came here and to serve and protect as well. Attaboy. I got your things for you right here. The hell for? Well you're in my unit now. You'll serve and protect with me. Oh, I get it. You're taking me along so that I'd fly with you, see a real fire and realize it's no joke. Am I getting that right, Pops? Catch a burn and run off home, that type of thing? Only I don't scare easily. We'll see. We fly in five minutes. If you're late, I'll report you missed take-off. You know what happens then. I hit the road with Kat. Katya is not going anywhere, that I promise you. I'm a man of my word. Ask the guys. Had your tick shot yet? No. Great job, son. You've got five minutes. Let's go. Okay. let's see what we've got here. Detonating cord. Guess we're blowing stuff up again. Let's get loaded up. Come on, let's go. Why is the windshield dirty? It's gonna get dirty all the same when we fly. Bon apetit. Thank you. I'm curious, Pavel. Do you have a single shirt that's white? Why? What do you mean why? A pilot starts wearing white shirts and it changes how he views himself and his work. Oh come on, Valera. We're not taking a bunch of politicians fishing. We're like bus drivers, there and back. Oh look, it's our passengers. Guys! Hello, guys. How're y'all doin'? Anybody got a powerbank? Gotta charge my cell. I gotta call my girlfriend to tell her I'm flying. Guess that's a no, huh? What's with all the "Armageddon" shit? We like a soft landing. You got a problem, rook? Whoa, there. Cool it, old-timer. Don't get all heated up. It's a joke. This boy's green. He'll be cryin' for home by tomorrow. He's all muscle, absolutely no brain. Ready to fly? Yoo-hoo, your dad stopped by. Thanks. Hey Kat. I'm registering your man to fly. Stop! Stop! Sir, Katya's on the runway. She'll get off it. What do I do? She'll get scared and get off. Come on, step on it. What're you doin'? She's not moving! Abort takeoff. Hands off me. - Faster! - She's not movin'. There's no time! Come on, take off. Outta the way, you idiot! - Brake! - It's too late for that. Unbelievable. Kat, come here. Well sir, I see now you brought him along. Why didn't you tell me? I'll be just fine. I promise. Well then, ready to fly? Approaching. See you, fire demon. It's kind of a ritual we have. The nearest populated area is Ol'khovo. We'll lay the mineral soil here. We stop the fire, save the village and then we- In and out in three hours. That's all we got. Wait, what? We're jumpin' right here? Affirmative. What if we touch down in the fire? No problem, it'll warm you up a bit. If you're scared, just go ahead and say it. I ain't scared at all. Just calculating my trajectory. The pilot reports you wouldn't jump and you go home. There's your trajectory. Just figured out your plan, sir. You're just too smart, Sergey. Don't sweat it, kid. Good luck. AERIAL FOREST PROTECTION SERVICE Whoa! I'm alive. Hey guys! What are you doin' up there, rook? Buildin' a nest? I'm fine, I'm fine. Just chillin'. Chill away. Hang in there. Hey guys, where you goin'? Now, what do we do with him, sir? Pyotr, you'll stay at the camp and keep an eye on him there. Hey Pyotr, how 'bout some grub first? Some steaks or somethin'? First we get to work, then we can eat. Fellas? No way, I have to eat first then work. Maks, give him a candy bar. How do I get outta this suit? I gotta go to the bathroom. Enjoy your meal. Good evening. Damn, been lookin' for you all over. Hey, where's your helmet, huh? Made me look like some kinda foreman. Why's your shovel crooked? It's a designer model. Made the handle myself. What's the hold up? Let's get to work. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! What do you think you're doing? You have to be assigned a task first. I know mine. You do, huh? Explain it to me. Well basically, I gotta dig this ditch a little longer so the fire doesn't jump across to my side. And what's this ditch called? It's called soil? - Yeah? - Uh. - Come on. - Uh. Spring soil. Keep thinkin' of bottled water. Why did you sit down? One sec. The term's mineral soil. You got it? Yeah, sure. That's what I meant. Okay and then what? Well next, we have to set our own fire to go meet it. Yeah, to meet what? To meet you, fire curls. Listen, rook. What's with the attitude? Whoa, why you gotta get up in my face? Okay, so we need to set our fire to meet that one, then they kinda extinguish each other. And what is that called? It's called a meeting fire? Meeting basically, you know. - Basically, sure. - C'mon, fellas. Let's finish up. Sergey, let's lay the cord. Konstantin, go ahead. Let's light it at the edge. Yes, sir. Keep going, further. Hey sir, it's a backfire. You remember, attaboy. Keep going! No, there's a backfire over there coming up behind Sergey. Shit. Sergey! Sergey! Stop, where are you going? Fire! Fire behind you, Sergey! Watch out! Run! Get outta here! Move it! Maybe we should celebrate. The wedding's tomorrow. C'mere, son. Look. Now our fire meets that fire and there'll be a bang. A big bang? No, don't worry. - Whoa. - Holy! What the hell are you doing here? Who the hell are you? Forest Protection. No no no. Please stop. Back up, back up. C'mon, stop it. Stop it, everybody. Everybody stop. You were told we'd be here. Nobody told us anything. What do you mean? Like I said you didn't warn us. There's been no communication for a week. Come on, guys. Let them put it out. You're Forest Protection? So do some protecting. You really soured the mood. We're celebrating a wedding tomorrow. ♪ Peer a little closer ♪ ♪ Come sit beside the fire ♪ ♪ I just can't wait much longer baby girl ♪ ♪ Just let me have enough of ♪ It's already been half an hour. ♪ Gorgeous loving eyes ♪ Pick the mushrooms. How long can it take? Valera, I'm asking you. Why didn't you warn the locals? My whole camp burned down. My unit's lost everything. Guys, what's burned is burned. You put the fire out and we're headin' home tomorrow. We need to sit on this thing at least another week. Can't be serious. We best head to the village then. At least we'll be able to get some sleep there. Don't worry. We'll sleep here on the forest floor. It's soft and you'll be pine-scented. I'll go there myself. I just gotta... Has anyone got a cell with the internet? Here, only the satphone works. Tomorrow you'll bring me tools, tents and food. Are you tellin' me how to do my job? That's what I thought! Get me what I need. Tell me then, go right ahead. Enough talking, Valera. Listen, Mr. Tolstoy. I need you to do me a favor. Could you ask Sokolov for the satphone? You see, I just wanna call my girlfriend. She works at the base. She can hook us up with some blankets and some real food. Maybe you need a razor. Just don't tell him that it's for me. Just say you need it to call the wife and kids. Got a son, maybe a daughter then? Fine, understood. Over and out. Pyotr, the mushrooms. What did you say to him? Nothin', I just asked about his family. He lost his wife. It was a fire. She was pregnant. All right, sleeping beauties. Rise and shine. Just a few more minutes, sir. Rise and shine I said. Look, fellas. The rook got himself a new lady while we slept. Rise and shine. Maybe she could cook us up some bacon. What the hell is this? So this is the plan: you go to the village and tell them your boss - Well you know what to say. Ask for food, tools and a tarp, got it? I'm putting Kostik in charge. That's right. I said we needed to go to the village. The hero of Russia has a special assignment here. What's that? Looking for firewood. You were meant to be together. Valera, here's your buckwheat. Sorry I couldn't get more. Asha, the way you look, I'm surprised they gave you anything. I got a whole jar of honey. Local pilot, he has his own bees. Bees? The unit's got nothing to eat. Honey's very nutritious. Did you gas up the plane? About that, it doesn't seem like there's a whole lotta fuel here either. There's no fuel, Valera, okay? There's enough to fly the unit home but not to patrol. What's that look for? We can use the chopper over there. Come meet the pilot. He's kind of a hermit. Flies an M-i like a god. Okopych. Okopych! Greetings, dear colleagues. Come take in the morning sun with me. There's no sun like it anywhere else. Okopych meet our spotter, Valera. Okopych will fly us around so we can have eyes on the fire. I don't get it. Are you a pilot or a beekeeper? Life with the bee is life in harmony. Okopych, is this buckwheat honey? Floral. What flowers? Dandelions. What kind, yellow or the gray kind? - Pasha. - Huh? Come here a second. Yes, sir? Was it the buckwheat or the shirt? What did I do? Go find fuel. Well shall we? Larisa Ivanovna is an older lady and doesn't have the lift for a vertical takeoff. So we'll cushion along the ground for a running takeoff and then lift just like a plane. Okay, Larisa Ivanovna.

What was it, Misha? I'm Konstantin. Call me Kostik. What are you drinking? It's just water. Are you sick? A real Russian keeps himself sober. Well then, guess I'm a real Russian too. For now, be a pal. Pass me that bottle. What bottle might that be? Nina, honey. I just wanted some fruit punch. I've been drivin' that bus all day. I'm parched. Pass the punch. Will punch drive us when the baby comes? Nina, that baby's been coming all week. Choose the city life just to get knocked up. Consider yourself warned. Keep an eye on him, no alcohol. Zoya, have some chicken. Home-reared, not like that city stuff full of antibiotics. Mom, I've already had some. Have another bun and these pies here. Mom, it's you making me fat, not the baby. Sure, why sit here? Go dance. - Look at that curly-haired guy. - Mom. Just cool it, okay? Cover your hair. You look like you've been sick. Huh? Look at that. Doesn't it hurt? I'm made of iron, ladies. Fireproof. Look, not a single scar. And that one? Oh, this. It's from appendicitis. Pulled it out myself. Ooh. And fire. That's a nice laugh, just like my mom's. Here you go, hotshot. Why'd you keep your pants on? Here you go, gorgeous. You have an eye problem? What do you mean, wrong spot? You're always wearing those. It's just how I roll. I can hook you up with a sweet pair if you'd like. Help take a few years off. It'll help - offset - the hair loss. Whose, mine? Well yeah. I don't mind Sunglasses help compensate. A little style, you know? Listen Mr. Stylist, I can see that you're scared. Happens to a lotta people and the shades don't hide it. What do you mean scared? When you flew, I flew. And when you jumped, I jumped. It was me who saw the backfire and saved everybody, so how 'bout we talk like adults? Like adults, how do you mean? This plan of yours ain't working. Get me? Come on, admit it. Okay, listen here. Forests have always burned and they always will. It's the law of nature like my hair loss, understand? Now my job is to save people from these fires. But the fact that Katya hasn't told you about her condition goes to show how much she trusts you. Vegetative vascular dystonia. You ever heard of that? Sure, it's like when dystonia. Mm-hmm. I mean I've definitely heard of it. Lemme explain. At high altitudes, Katya can experience panic attacks either on a plane or jumping, from the changing air pressure. It's that simple. Got it? Now this junk you brought us couldn't heat a bird's nest. We need real firewood. Go get some birch. You know what it looks like, right? Vegetative vascular what? Sokolov, do you copy? Copy that. We found the base of the fire. The wind's driving it towards Ol'khovo. How much time do we have? Not much. It's a crown fire. Can you hear me? It's over 100 meters a minute. It can't be stopped. Get your men and we'll get you out. Got it. Sending up a flare now. I see you. Let base know over the satphone. Stylist! Hey dad. Kat, it's Roman. Roman. Oh my god. How are you? Are you all right? Hey, do you trust me, Katya? What do you mean? Just what I said, do you trust me or don't you? Roman, did something happen? Yeah, my girlfriend didn't tell me about her chronic illness. I've coped fine with it for three years. Could've gotten sick. I'm fine, okay? How can I prove it if you won't let me fly? Hiding it was irresponsible. Did you even consider how I would feel? Is it me you're worried about or trouble with my dad? Your dad and I are getting along just fine. Mm-hmm. I'm worried about you and me. So why are you giving me such a hard time? Hello? Roman, can you hear me? Hello? Great, now I'm getting the silent treatment. Listen, there's a fire and it's just me here. - I gotta tell the guys. - A fire? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Roman? Hello, Roman? It's time! The baby's coming. - Nina, calm down. - Girls, it's coming. Out of the way. It's coming quick. I sensed it. Come on. - We need to go now. - It's okay. - Just my water. - I don't care. - Out of the way, move. - Careful. I'll get her back. - Vitya, start the bus. - Call the hospital. - It's gonna be fine. - We have no signal. Fruit punch, huh? Fruit punch, huh? I thought I asked you to watch him! Nina, just gimme five minutes and we'll go. Are you okay? Are any of you boys sober? Who can drive us to the hospital? Well? Hey, why don't you come sit next to me? Hey, I'm the godmother. - Okay, Nina? - Okay! Sit back here, it'll be more comfortable. Vitya, why you doin' this? We've got work to do 'round here. It's not your job. One hour there, one back. I'll talk to the Cap. Who else could I ask? Not one of our men is sober. Zoya, breathe. Like she can't figure that out herself. All right, away from the bus. I'm going to get my grandson. Mom, why are you telling people they're the godmother? The mom can't do a thing right. You'll thank me later. All this for a thanks. Are you still alive there? Drive! Hey, it's a good thing these people gave us food. Hey, minions. Over here. That's right, Arnold, you. C'mere a sec. Sergey, there's no time for this. - Sergey. - Hey, get outta here, kid. It's about to get rough. Go to your mom. Well guys, got everything you need? That's right. Then beat it, okay? Hey, I just wanted the girl's number, that's all. You dumb or what? We asked you nicely. You callin' me dumb? Sergey, that's enough. Hey, what's up, pal? Come here! I'll kick your ass! Hey bro, easy. I just had surgery. I swear. Get over here. Come here. What did I do? We were playin' football. Where's Pyotr? He took a pregnant woman to the hospital. There's a crown fire headed this way. What? What do you mean? Where's the satphone? We have to inform the base. Listen, head to camp, find the rookie and get back here. We don't want people to panic. Fire! The forest is on fire! - Shh, quiet. - We saw a fire there. A big one. - It's close. - Shut up. - Over there. - Where's the satphone? The satphone? I needed to call Katya. Give it here. Hurry up, rook. We need to tell base. I - kinda - dropped it. You what? Wait, that was the only one? What? You were telling me all that stuff about her health, so I thought I'd give her a call. Idiot, we've got no comms now. - What are you doin' here? - Everybody, listen! Hey, come on. What are you talkin' about? This isn't like the fire you put out yesterday. Yeah, yeah. So go get to work. It's a crown fire if you know what I mean and it's headed here. We have to get outta the village. Head out of the village? What are you talking about? - This is a wedding. - It's ridiculous. - This is my wedding. - Quiet! Quiet all of you! Got a minute? It's spreading through the treetops. We can't stop it. First, it'll jump to the sawmill, then to your homes. Everything will be lost. People will die, that simple. You've got 10 minutes to pack your things. The person you're calling cannot be reached. The person you're calling cannot be reached. If you'd like to leave a message. Sir, there's no response on satellite or cell. Something's wrong. Where at? In Ol'khovo. Anya, bring up Petrossova and find Ol'khovo. Zoom in. OLKHOVO It's clear, look. There's always a delay. It's only four hours off. No smoke, winds two meters per second. Dead call. Can't you call them, sir? A pilot, a spotter, anybody? Katya, enough. Please, uncle. Fine, I'll call them. Where's that spotter? Here he is. Your dad's been doing this all your life. Sometimes he doesn't call for weeks and you've been fine. - The person you're calling- - What's changed? It's not just my dad out there. Sir, the minister's on the line about the plant. Katya, I haven't slept in three days. I have to go. Go back to work. Gromov here, sir. Andrey, wait a second. Andrey. Sir, we've got everything under control. All right. We gotta get goin', guys. Come on. - Get all your stuff. - Okay. All right, guys. C'mon let's go! All right, let's move it. Let's move, let's move, let's move. - Everybody out. - Unload the car. Everybody out, we gotta go. - We don't have time for this. - C'mon. - Take only what you need. - We gotta go. - Get to the car. - Don't take that. - You don't need that. - Let's go. - C'mon, c'mon. - C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Faster! - This way, move it! - Run, you guys. Sir. Sir, a guy won't leave his house and he's got a wife and - C'mon, c'mon! Hurry, let's move, everybody! - You guys, over there! - Come on. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. We don't have time. Leave what you don't need. Sir, I want to apologize. Maybe I can-- Leave the cow! The cow, leave it. Stop, stop, stop. What the hell are we waiting for? Get in line. We leave in an orderly fashion. He says there's no room for us to ride with him. Says he's got chickens. Okay, let's see. What did I tell you? Lose the chickens and let the girls ride! Come on, let's go! These chickens are like family to me. Those girls aren't even from here. Cool it. Come on, girls. You sit in the van. Don't leave people with nothing. Panic's worse than fire. - Slava, come on. - Hey, excuse me. - Let's get outta here. - Hey, hey. Hey, can we please finish our wedding? There's still the cake, the first dance. Send someone into town for help. We spent months planning this. No time. Is there nothing we can do? Change into comfortable clothes. It's no use. - Get away from me! - Turn it off right now! Nice house, huh? Warm and dry. No time to douse it. It'll burn up in three minutes. We're evacuating the village. I'll take your family and you do what you want, okay? Come on, kids. Let's go. Watch your step. It's okay. Hurry up. Misha, please let's go. Let's go, huh? They're the firefighters. They know better. Misha. Kostik, let's move out. I got it, Cap. Sokolov, I can't see you. We're getting the villagers evacuated and ready to hit the road. Forget the road. There's- I didn't copy that. Repeat. I repeat: the road's on fire. Forget the road. It's on fire. I repeat: the road's on fire. Here, drink some water. I'm fine. Fine. When I gave birth to you, I didn't have time to call. I got up, got on the bus and went to the hospital by myself. A friend of mine gave birth in Kazakhstan with no electric lights. They lit matches. And look at you. CALLING SATELLITE The person you're calling cannot be reached. What now? We have to turn back. But we're nearly there. It's just the bridge and that's it. Aren't you a firefighter? There's no fire. It's just smoke. Come on, go! Christ, what's wrong with men these days? Take out some rags and seal up any cracks. FLAMMABLE Sir, the minister's here. What? The minister has just arrived. I have no idea why. Why didn't they warn me? I haven't shaved. Hello, satellite monitoring? It's Ekaterina Sokolova, Gromov's new deputy. Can you please update us on Karelia? Yes, I know, but I - I mean Chief Gromov needs to know right now. It's imperative. Right now, that's correct. Thank you, we'll be waiting. Uncle Vova. Don't Uncle Vova me. What the hell, Katya? I could fire you for crap like that. Fire me for what? Lying to me. Sometimes saving people means lying. Here. Look, it's just come in, see? Can't you see what's happening there? You need to send people in planes, B-200s as soon as possible. The Be-200s are needed elsewhere. The chemical plant is in danger. Its gas line's exposed and you're worried about a village. I see. So that's why we let homes and malls burn. It's just a bunch of worthless people, that's all. And what if I send those planes out there for nothing? Who's gonna answer for that? I will if nobody else will. You care more about your career than you do other people's lives. You're too young. Maybe I am, but I get it all right. Don't count on others. Nobody's looking out for you or coming to rescue you. And if anything happens to these guys, you'll bail on them as well in a heartbeat! If these aren't your own people, then who are? You Sokolovs are real hard asses. We're here. Fire's coming this way. The river's here. It's four clicks through the forest. We make it there and we're safe. We won't make it carrying the kids. We'll put the kids and the women in the chopper. Valera, do you copy? I'm sending out a line. Clip onto it and we'll go. Valera, do you copy? Valera, we're evacuating people. Negative. I've come to get you out. We're not going anywhere. Sit 'er down, Valera. No can do. She's too old. I need you to take the children. I repeat: I cannot land. I'm sending you down a line. Clip onto it and we'll go. Hawk, do you copy? Hawk! Valera, I need to know how much your line can hold. For what? We can take two tons. Oh no, no, no. No way. Keep going! Lower! Okay, we've got it. All right, it's attached. What the hell is going on, huh? Hey, so we going or not? Change of plan. We'll head for the river through the forest. Road's out of action. Ditch the thing. With the kids, are you nuts? Women and kids go by air. Are you insane? They could fall. Only option we got. We can't land the helicopter. It's too dangerous. We're carefully going to lift them and take them to base. Take him. Come on, buddy. It's fine. Sit there. There's no time. Get the kids! - All right, come on. - Mama. It'll all be fine. Squeeze in tighter. Lock your arm around your kid like this. Don't let go. - Where are you taking them? - Let go of her. - Tikka, come here. - Mom. - Come here! - Mom! - Sit right here. - Listen to me. I'm done listening to you. You have to calm down now. Calm down? Would you put your own kids in there? Look at me. If my daughter were here, she'd be in there with you, understand? Understand? Do you understand? - Come on, come on. - Come on up. Close it up. Stand back, fellas. Everybody settle down. We're all right. We know what we're doin'. Valera, get ready. Take 'er up, Valera. Come on, take off. Take off! - Take off! - What about the rest of 'em? Careful, don't drop them! Don't jinx it! We did need to lose 200 kilos to fly like a plane. No way. Hawk, we can't lift it. Take three women off. Ladies, someone needs to stay behind. The helicopter can't take off. Decide who's getting off or nobody goes anywhere. Ladies, all of you get off the truck. We'll just take the kids. Who'll stay with them? Are you insane? Our calling. I'm not moving. Fine, then I guess we'll just sit and wait for the fire to get here. Girls, my darlings. Listen to me. You have to get off the truck. There isn't much time. - Natasha. - Mom. - Natasha. - Mom? - There's no time. - Mom, no. - Mom. - Come on. - Come on. - Mom, what are you doing? Here. Come on, girls. - Let's go. - Mom, mom! Calm down. I will come back. You'll be okay. Come on, we gotta go. Out, out, out! Get up. We have no time. Now! C'mon, let's go. We need to tie them all in tight. Rook, go get some rope. I will come back. Maks, Maks! Get over here! Get in and start 'er up. Come on, gimme a smile. It's gonna be just fine. Hold on tight to the rope. The jumper will start forward and you'll move with it. It'll be a running takeoff. Valera, you got the fire shelters? Do you have fire shelters? I've got everything. You give the order. She's worn out. We'll take off straight ahead. Okay, we're going down to get around the fire. Yeah, we'll take off then hang a right. Is the base that way? No, stop. This is the only option we have right now. My babies. Mom. - Mom. - It'll be okay. I know, I know. It's gonna be okay. Let me get my kid, please! Don't be scared. Okay, let's go. Godspeed. Larisa, come on. All right, let's go! Stop! - Mama! - I love you. No, stop. I love you. Can you hear me? - My sweetie. - Mama! Mama, no. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Climb higher. Climb higher! I said climb, dammit. I'll toss you right out that goddamn door! Higher! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Larisa Ivanovna, I know you could do it! Look, you guys. We're astronauts! Woo! They're in the air. Okay, let's get to the river. Sergey, take center. Kostik at the back. Come on. Let's go. Let's go, let's go. All right, let's go. Leave your things! They'll slow you down. Come on, rook. Come on, rook! Come on. Run! Here we go. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Do you have authorization? It's an emergency. That's not how it works. There's no authorization in place. Sir, with all due respect. They could put us away as well. Your phone got a camera? - Yeah, sure. - Hand it over. Come on, come on. Here you go. Record me. I, Vladimir Gromov, without the consent of my superiors and against all pilot advice have decided to personally assume command of a B-200. I am ready to be held accountable. There. I'd rather go to prison than bury my own people. - Where's mommy? - Mom! Mom! Hey guys, we'll be landing in just a few minutes. Hang in there. That's why so nobody gets sick, I'd like to offer each of you a piece of candy. Go ahead, take a piece. Houston, Huston, we have a problem. We lost the cable. You all okay? Yes, but we need to land right now. You hear me, Valera? Land right now, Valera. We need a clearing. We can't land. We unhook the truck and put the kids in here. No no no no no. We're nearly there. We can make it. And if we don't? You said it yourself, she's too old to even attempt that. It's either that or we drop the kids. Okay, clearing where are you? Reveal yourself. Your hand. I can't go on. There we go. Gimme your hand. Plant your feet. Gimme your hand. Go ahead. Take my hand. What the hell are you carrying? What? It's valuable scrap. I'm going to have a grandson to pay for. Let's go! Let's go. Fire travels faster uphill. Help me here, rook! Sergey, wait a second. Let them say goodbye to their homes. Kostik, I need you to take the lead. You got it, sir. We need to keep moving. Sure. Let's get goin'. - Come on, come on, come on. - Stay to the right, - - ground's easier. - Come on. Gimme your hand. Come on, come on! Fire travels faster uphill. Here, breathe. We're at the bridge. We made it. Mom. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Where are we goin'? C'mon, c'mon. C'mon, c'mon. Where are we supposed to go? There's nowhere left. Hold onto me. Stay close, stay close. We're gonna die. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom. We have to get out of here now. You need to wake up. Hey, what's wrong with you, huh? Hey, you need to wake up. Please help me. Help me! Please help me. Help me please. Help me. Please. - Help. - Please. Please. Help us. Please. Please help me. Please help me. Look at me, Look at me. It's all going to be okay. What's your name? Mine's Pyotr. Shh. Shh. Again, come on. One more time. Come on, again. Come on, come on, come on. I can't. Come on, you're doin' great. - Just one more push. - I can't. - I can't. - Breathe. Come on. Okay guys, everybody out. Follow me, let's go. Jump in, little buds. Take a seat over there. That's everyone. Let's go! Hold on tight to each other. Up we go! Come on, come on, come on. Take 'er up! What did I tell you, huh? Hey, hey, what's all this? We ain't scared of this. You're all my heroes. I got your medals right here. Toss out whatever we don't need. Heavy stuff first! Go stand over there, guys. In the corner, go, go! Stand by your man, Larisa Ivanovna. Come on, sweetie, do it for me. It's just you and me now. I'll shower you with kisses. I'll treat you right. You'll always be my girl. Did it work? She's not in the mood. How much fuel you got left? Less than a ton. Dump it. What? I said dump it. Are you out of your mind? One spark and we're toast. We'll be toast soon anyway. I absolutely won't allow it. What do you suggest, that we dump the kids? If we dump the fuel, we might be able to fly on the reserve tank. If we catch the wind, we should be able to make it back. Take the controls, Valera. Are you both crazy? Empty the left tank. I'll get the right. Maksim, c'mon! All right, get in. Okay, now let's all take off our shoes. Yes. Okay and now our jackets. Kinda warm in here, isn't it? Like at the beach. Come on, sweetie. She just can't lift us. Come on, come on. Climb. Okay guys, listen up. Now everybody who believes in miracles, shut your eyes and count to three. We'll take off. One. Don't peek. Two. Three! Come on, come on, come on. Climb! Come on, Larisa Ivanovna. Okopych, we're climbing. - Okopych. - We're climbing! We're climbing! We're climbing! - We're climbing! - Kids, we're flying! We're up! I can't believe it. We're up. What are we going to do? Is it much further to the river? Just a little. How much is a little? About 200 meters, maybe 300. Stop panicking. Panic's worst than fire. We're rescuing you. You guys don't even know what you're doing. Who's gonna rescue us? There's fire everywhere. Quiet. Calm down. How much cable do you have? - Oh my god. - How long is it? Think I measured it? I see. Give it here. Kostik, help me. Everybody quiet! Now listen to me. I'm going to lay a pathway to the river with this cable and then you're going to follow it. How will we know when to set off? I'll send up a flare. You'll see it in the sky. Will you make it? I'll make it back. And what do we do if you don't? Konstantin. Yes, sir. There are fire shelters in this backpack. If I don't make it, hand them out. But there aren't enough. So some of us won't make it? Huh? - Some of us are done for, huh? - Nobody's done for, Pops. Pops, Pops. Nobody's gonna die. Pops, look at me. - Nobody's going to die, okay? - Come on! Kostik, hang on for two minutes. Hmm? Oh shit. This here is a fire shelter. Each is designed to shield just one person. We don't have enough for everybody. I'm sorry. Take 'em. Open them up. Go on, open them. Take them and open them up. Follow my lead, hurry, hurry. I'll demonstrate how to use 'em. Nothing to be afraid of. Dad. You have kids to take care of. Now everybody lay down on the ground, bunch up close. All the oxygen is down here. Sir, sir. Are you all right? Put him out, put him out. Sir, can you hear me? Kostik, lead the group along the cable. Sergey, you take center. Rookie at the back. And you, sir? I'll catch my breath, then follow. Move it, Kostik. We've got people to rescue. Okay, everybody behind me! I want you right on my heels. Cover your heads. There's boiling resin coming down. Let's go, quickly! Come on! Sir! Get up. Wake up, sir. Wake up! I can see people down there. Take her lower. Come on, come on. Jump! Go ahead! Jump! Come on! Is everyone here alive? Rookie's not here. Alexey's missing. Sokolov, where is he? Alexey! Hey! Hey! Hey, we're down here! Here! Help, we're down here! Sir, there's someone else. Take her lower. Do it. Well now you gotta spring for that Hero of Russia medal. For who? What do you mean? Anybody who rescues a hero of Russia's gotta be an even bigger hero of Russia. Oh, come on. Why so uptight? I'm just kidding around. Excuse me, sir? Yeah? I think I ripped my pants. Attaboy. Is my mommy here? They'll find you in just a minute. - What about my dad? - And your dad, of course. They're waiting for you. - You're our hero. - What, me? The real hero's in the cockpit there. Now how about a little tea? You like honey? Let's go drink some tea with honey. Come on. Stay together now. This way. AERIAL FOREST PROTECTION M. SHUSTOV Daddy, daddy! Lena, my little Lena. Buddy.
