You have reached ANVISA the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency. Good afternoon, Aline speaking. Who am I speaking with? Good afternoon, Aline. My name is Katiele. ILLEGAL I've ordered something from the US, but it hasn't arrived. Instead, I've received a telegram. It asks for the product's name and manufacturer. Also, it requires a statement containing the use and the purpose of the product I'm importing. It says that the statement must contain all the required information. But actually, they're not requiring any information. What kind of product is it? It's a dietary supplement. If it's not a restricted product or anything that requires a prescription... It's a controlled product. So a doctor or anyone enabled to prescribe it will have to certify that you need it. Yes, I already have a statement. I'll read it to you, OK? "Anny Bortoli, 5 years old", this is my daughter. "She has a very rare disorder." "She displays a psycho-motor disorder" "as a result of a brain disease." "Among the symptoms she has seizures." "It's resistant to every treatment available in the country." "I hereby justify the request for cannabidiol" "based on what was said above", which is her current situation. When we found out about the CBD and decided to import it, we knew it came from Cannabis sativa, and for this reason, it was illegal in the country. But the agony of seeing my daughter having seizures every day was so big that we decided to face it and bring the medication no matter how, even if we had traffic it. And that's what we did. That's the word: trafficking. Anny was planned. We planned on having her since the first one was born. So, when she was born, we were very happy, but I knew there was something about her eyes. Then, in typical mother-and-daughter moment, when you are staring at your little baby, when you can smell their scent... I was holding her when she had her first seizure. It was a mixture of fear and astonishment, because that should not be happening to me. To my daughter. To my family. It didn't seem real, you know? She didn't move she didn't smile... She looked like a little doll... ...quiet, static. When she was three, she was able to walk. She could actually stand up and take confident steps. That was a very important moment, because, at the age of three, she could finally walk. The whole thing was a moment of joy. But right after that... ...she began to have more aggressive seizures, and due to the syndrome and the attacks, she started to lose her abilities. And after four months, she had already forgotten everything she had accomplished over three years. I think it was one of the saddest moments of our lives. But despite the sadness, we never lost hope... ...that one day she would be able to recover her abilities. And it was precisely this feeling of hope that made us search all over the world for something that could really help her. And what we found was CBD. Cannabidiol is a compound that is found in Cannabis sativa, the marijuana tree. It doesn't have any psychoactive effects and it's responsible for some of the species' medicinal properties. When she was 35 days old, she started having seizures. And that's when our fight began. It was the acceptance phase, I would cry a lot, I would go to class crying and I would come back crying. I would think: "I have a special daughter". It was a mission, and I knew it. When she was born, I thought: "She is perfect". But after a month, she had a seizure, and we didn't think it was something serious. So you start to look for a solution. You start to go to spiritual centers and try every option there is to try. It took us two and a half years to diagnose it. The doctors used to say: "It could be this or that". "You have to take her abroad." I have always dealt with her situation better than him. He suffers quite a bit more than I do. One night, he suddenly woke me up and said: "You know, there is a girl that has been using" "a medicine made from marijuana," "and she has achieved great results." "It seems that, within 15 days, the seizures have stopped." He was so excited, and I was still sleeping. We had already tried all kinds of medication. Nothing worked, and we were feeling depressed. Suddenly, you find someone in the same situation, who found a new drug that has been working. I looked at it and saw that it was working. The whole cannabis and CBD thing, I had no idea that people could use one of the compounds of the tree to produce medicine. I never had any prejudice towards marijuana, so, for me, it didn't seem so complicated as it would seem to other people. It was a relief to know that in the US there was this little girl who had been using it and the medicine was actually working. Then, you start to think: "If anyone wants to sue me, go ahead." Katiele is much like me. She laughed right away and took it with humor. She started to follow my instructions. I didn't quite know it worked over there, but when I told her the news, I sounded like an insane person. "Hey, people are giving marijuana to this little girl and it's working," "do you want to try it as well?" What we were told when we were children, is that this is a drug, so you have to keep away from it, it's evil. This was the impression I had. After trying everything and nothing worked, the possibility that this could help puts and end to any sort of prejudice. Even if it's something bad, in theory. In the beginning, I didn't believe in it, but the actual consequence, the results from using it were excellent. We were given a contact in the US. This contact would make the purchase, receive the product, hide it in a box, and send it to Brazil. We would receive it at home, through the mail. As soon as we realized it was working, we started to look for a way to buy it again. This time, the package disappeared. It was held. The customs sent it to ANVISA, which soon after, sent us a telegram. You have reached ANVISA, the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency. Good afternoon, Camila speaking. Who am I speaking with? Good afternoon, Camila, my name is Katiele. Look, Camila, here's the thing. I have imported a product and I received a telegram... I need to speak with someone from ANVISA who may help me. I'll be honest with you: I don't know where this product is. I don't have much time, I need this product. I won’t read the regulation again and won't contact you again either. It doesn't make sense. I ask you for an explanation and you tell me to read the regulation I don't understand, and then you tell me to call you back. It's easier if we cut all this bureaucracy: I'm already talking to you and I don't know the regulation. So put me in touch with someone who can tell me what I can do to buy the product I need. Ma'am, all this information was already given to you. This is how we proceed. Will I have to go through this every time I import? Will my daughter have to stay at home convulsing? She'll keep having 60 seizures every week? I don't know if you did the math, but it adds up to one seizure every two hours. How much will I have to wait to have this product after answering the telegram? That's why we're telling you to contact the post office, because the product is being held there. OK. So you're telling me you can't help me and I'll have to go to the post office? To the post office, yes. Can I help you with anything else? I think so, but you're telling me different. Alright, then. Thanks anyway. It's alright. Its alright. That's it, it's OK. A seizure is something that... When you see it for the first time, it seems the person is about to die. So, for a mother, it's like seeing their child dying every time. Regarding epilepsy cases that are more aggressive, you will often see the child's development being affected. I always go this way. Both, child and mother, are traumatized from constant visits to hospitals or ERs. At this moment, the family takes the responsibility for this. I understand very well, because you try to put yourself on their shoes. And the mother is forced to take a leap in the dark. This worries me, because medical attention is essential. We get very concerned, because while the doctors want to help us, there's also the lack of research. So we try to work together, right, doctor? As professionals, we get a little insecure when facing the possibility of receiving some penalty or even having our credentials suspended, in the worst case scenario. So we have to fight for our right to research. I believe the mothers and their children have the right to have more researches being carried out about cannabidiol. In 2013, we were very worried that we were not able to tell the doctor the amount of seizures she used to have. We would show him the numbers, but I believe the numbers couldn't really represent it. So we developed a graphic that showed the distribution of attacks over the days and a weekly and monthly perception. For instance, the numbers from October show the amount Os attacks she was having. And the numbers were quite large. In November, the number of seizures were also pretty high, until 11/11, when we gave her the first doses of cannabidiol. It took a while to have any effect, but we could see the graphic began to clear up. By the end of November, the number of seizures had already decreased. From 60 to 19. After that, in December, Anny had a few infections, she got sick, but even so, the number of seizures decreased. By January, we could really feel the difference. Because by the second week of the month, the attacks had practically stopped. So even with the infections and the sore throat, she didn't have seizures anymore. But in February, we ran out of medicine and the amount of seizures increased again. A sense of hopelessness, right? Good afternoon. Welcome to the post office call center. This line is exclusive for compliments, suggestions, and complaints. All our operators are busy at the moment. Please, hold on the line. TELEGRAM All the operators are still busy. Please, hold a little longer. Michele speaking, who am I speaking with? Good afternoon, Michele, my name is Katiele. Good afternoon, Katiele, how can I help you? How much is the product, Mrs. Katiele? -One hundred dollars. -One hundred? You were asked to give all this information? Yes. ANVISA has approved it and put it under special evaluation. The army or institutions like that. -Is it a dietary supplement? -Yes, it is. It's a supplement that... ...controls my daughter's seizures. I see. Can you see why it's urgent? Yes. Maybe you can ask for help at an authorized agency associated with ANVISA. How much time will I have to wait for an answer? Initially, five days. -Five days? -Correct. Is there anything else, Mrs. Katiele? I just wanted to say I'm disgusted by this bureaucracy, because in the meantime... This deadline is for the answer, not for approval. Yes, it's just that in this meantime, my daughter has more than 50 seizures because I don't know where's the product she needs. -Is there anything else? -No, that'll be all. Thanks for calling, have a good night. Good night. Unfortunately, bureaucracy is depressing. Because, it makes you bounce from one person to the next, in the end, no one gives you a straight answer, No one! As much as I try to make a way and call people, I can't get a simple answer. "How long". That's all I wanted to know. That's all. It's been decades since we last had new medication. Decades. Those who don't know about it are against it. Those who don't research are against it. From the bat. "It comes from marijuana? I am against it." I wasn't afraid people would say: "Is he prescribing forbidden medication?" I didn't do it. All I did was report the experience from using the medicine. What it does is, it relieves cases of epilepsy... that can't be controlled with other types of medication. If we succeed, this will be very important in the future. And that's on you. Why isn't it approved here? Why isn't this easier? They are either incompetent and have no interest at all or there are political and financial forces that have a great influence on all this. Since, legally, I can't have something that can benefit my daughter so much, I became a drug dealer. For us, its a very delicate fight, because we are aware this product is something good, that has good points, we also know that anything we say or do will involve moral values. Try to picture the suffering of the mother or the family. You see your child, you know there is a medicine, but then you find out it's beyond your reach. So you are not going to do anything about it? Even this is affected by monetary interests? Come on. My enemy has no face, I don't know who to fight, who to appeal to, or who to talk to. I still believe I have the right to do this for her. Even though it's illegal. "You give her medicine that comes from Cannabis sativa?" "Do you bring it here illegally?" And I say "yes". I do it because it's good for her, it makes her life better, and that is what matters to me and my family. A little girl who has a condition that leads to multiple convulsions. Only one drug works, but it's forbidden in Brazil, since it comes from marijuana. If you were one of her parents, would you buy the drug anyway? A Brazilian couple decided to do it, and a documentary tells their story. Scenes from the short movie "Illegal". On January 15th, somebody called me. It was a guy named Tarso. That was the first time we talked to him. He wanted information on cannabidiol, information on its use and how we were doing it. He wanted to write a story on it. His call made me very happy, because someone had heard our plea. Medical marijuana was a very delicate subject. It was something no one would talk about and few people even knew about it, and it's extremely important. While I was getting ready to write the story, I found out about Katiele and Anny. On the week of the interview she'd had 3 seizures, down from 60. The results were so incredible, they would easily justify any behavior that would allow this medicine to keep reaching that child. However, she wasn't allowed do it. You feel angry. I can't believe it! This is... ...so backward. She wasn't afraid and she was ready to fight. She was up for it. After the story was published, he contacted me and offered to make a short movie. We accepted right away, and we said: "Sure, Tarso! That would be great!" I got very nervous. So when the staff arrived, they started to set up all the equipment, and we started to get more and more excited. So we shot for two straight days. The video was edited and then released. "CAMPAIGN SPREADS THE BENEFITS OF MARIJUANA." The impact was instantaneous. To inform, to draw attention, to make people aware, to start a discussion on the issue, which, so far, is considered a tabu. I always thought it was weird that this discussion, that has been happening in other countries, took so long to get here. Fantástico and Fátima Bernardes came all the way over here, as well as CBN and several magazines. All the papers wanted to know about it publish and publish it. This helped us a lot. My heart is racing. So come in, please. Hello. On Thursday, the movie was released in São Paulo On Sunday, the story was aired. On Monday, the lawyer started to pursue court action. "Court ruling allows girl to use medicine derived marijuana." I believe that all this media exposure and with all that has been done, it will be easier. The doors are open. We just have to get in. On April 3rd, 2014, Anny Fischer became the first person legally allowed to import a marijuana-based product in Brazil. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for coming. We are starting another meeting of the Parents Association for People with Epilepsy, the APPEPI. Most people didn't know that cannabidiol could control seizures. The Fantástico piece was a turning point regarding social awareness over the issue. When I first read it, I read it before I saw the movie. I thought that mother was just crazy. I would never give my son marijuana. After I watched "Illegal", the issue started to feel real. It became something "humane". He was diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome. It's terrifying for parents to know that their child, who's almost walking, who's practically normal, after two years, won't develop anymore and will have severe cognitive delays, and 60 per cent of Dravet carriers die before turning six. So we even began to mourn. There's a great demand from children with refractory epilepsy, who need this sort of civil organization in order for the legislature to get involved, and also for the judiciary to get involved, so maybe we can finally start to produce it here to help those mothers that don't have U$ 500,00 every month... Everybody in my family is associated with the army. My husband is in the army, I was in the army, my father-in-law is in the army... I have always been old-fashioned, I've never even seen marijuana. I have no idea what it is. And when I look at it, I currently give my son three drugs, I give him topiramate, Depakene, and clobazam to a child that is only one year and three months old, So why can't I give him CBD? If there is a solution, and CBD comes from marijuana, fine, we will use marijuana. if it was found in pineapples, we would use pineapples. But it isn't. The strength those mothers are showing is huge. They don't care if there's a law that might put them in jail from 5 to 15 years for traffic, they will keep buying a banned medication that comes from marijuana in order to treat their children. It's a social demand, they want to take care of their children and they are showing the State the path to be followed. As a matter of fact, they're doing politics. On Thursday, Katiele's injunction was issued. On Friday, ANVISA released a note which said that nobody had talked to them and that importing the drug was a possibility. They didn't even know which documents were required. They just told me: "Bring everything you have". The fact that ANVISA had authorized the acquisition of the product for children with refractory epilepsy, along with the fact that a prescription was required, suggests that the government was also authorizing the doctor to issue that prescription. So it seemed that we were allowed to prescribe it. However, it wasn't that simple, because we still don't have an official position regarding that. I had an appointment with the doctor on Thursday, so I decided to wait and talk to doctor Wagner, who I didn't know, and ask him for a prescription. When I talked to him about CBD and asked for his opinion, he told me this was currently the only option for Dravet. If there's anything for Dravet nowadays, it's CBD. But he didn't want to prescribe it. He didn't want to put this on paper. ANVISA requires the prescription. And how will I do this without a prescription? I got the prescription from a friend, who is Gustavo's doctor since he was born. I didn't think twice. I didn't even think. I did it in accordance with all the regulations. What is the problem of giving the prescription? It's not any drug, people are researching it, it's medicine, it´s for medical use. It's a belief that is typical of a doctor's education, to believe that it's just harmful. So, people are afraid. If THC was the solution, I would prescribe THC. I'm not sure what I would do if I was a doctor. I'm a mother. If a mother wants CBD, she will get CBD. For her, it seems absurd that a doctor wouldn't prescribe it. I think the pharmaceutical industry is involved. We can't imagine the role that greed has in a capitalist world. Because if CBD succeeds, people would stop buying Depakene, Depakote, phenobarbital, and hidantal, am I right? It's something hard to investigate. There's no way of knowing the influence of the "Big Pharma" in the whole situation. But this is something that clearly goes against all the lobby imposed by the Big Pharma. It took me, Camila, an educated woman, a mother that loves her son, living in Brasilia, right next to ANVISA, I took one month... ...to get enough CBD for just three months. And that's me, Camila, and I live in Brasília. But what about the people living in Rio Grande do Sul's countryside? What about those living in Ceara's countryside? What is she going to do about it? I'm totally for the local production. But I would like the right seeds. People say there are people in Brazil producing them. So if I could buy it, if I could import the right seeds, and if I knew those seeds had the right amount of CBD and THC, I would do it. Because I want to fight for it, I have to do it. He is my only son. As a surgeon, it seems that every surgery adds a weight on my shoulders. Patients show no improvements. Every week I do four or five back surgeries. That's what I do. If the patient doesn't get better, I also feel bad. So I started to see cannabis as an alternative. As for the surgery screw, morphine, or opioids, I would also like to use cannabis as a therapeutic option. And I didn't. I went to Amsterdam, brought back some seeds, and I started to research how to do this. So, one day I found Growroom while surfing the web, and I saw that the page had a few tips on how it works. I began to search how to grow it and realized it was feasible. Then I decided I would do it. Ever since Growroom came about, if you do a quick search, you'll see that the first article on medical marijuana is probably dated from 2002, the year the page was created. Most of the visitors are people looking for treatment, people who go seek, in Growroom, information about their diseases and treatments with marijuana. My best results were observed in patients with fribromyaldia, at first. This was a turning point in my life, in terms of Cannabis. I was doing something and it was working. It's a long-term investment, both of money and time, because it's free, there's no financial feedback, It's a life project, I think. If you have tried everything and nothing has worked, you'll keep taking medicine that bring some relief. At the same time, we'll start this treatment. "Are you up for it?", and everyone says "yes". Everyone. I just bring up the subject, I just offer it to the patient when I've know the person for a long time, years. It's not months, it takes me years to offer this to patients. Margarete and I are very close, but besides her, nobody knows about it. Actually, Sofie is the only child I know using it, no one else. I use a species that contains only CBD, the Harle-Tsu. If a doctor, in Brazil, prescribes any marijuana-based medicine, or marijuana itself, he will have his registry suspended, and will be investigated for this. The Regional Council of Medicine, in São Paulo, stipulated it in 2010 and hasn't altered it ever since. Due to this, the doctors in Brazil cannot prescribe it, but they are free to say whatever they want. If I lose my registration, I can't pay my bills. Unlike other professionals, we rely on a Council that will grant us permission to work. We're celebrating Anny's birthday today. It's her first birthday after we were granted the right to legally import CBD. I would like authorities in Brazil to carry out a careful study about it, along with qualified professionals, doctor and scientists, for instance, and the politicians themselves got involved, not only for Anny, but for children all over the country and even the world. We got scared, at first, because we had no idea it was possible to make medicine from marijuana. And if they use it responsibly, we have to support it and make it accessible not just for Anny, but for others. So, they may have this possibility. I'll sing from the heart So listen very carefully I thank you very much And I say it sincerely You came this far To be around us To bring us a bit of joy And make things a little better Anny, you just couldn't be any different. You couldn't be someone else. You're simply our Anny. A girl who teaches us every day that nothing happens by chance. A six-year old girl who is able to change lives. And to change the history of a country as big as Brazil. Here we go. My tummy hurts. The website... ...Te delivery date has vanished from the FedEx website. It was Thursday, but now it says "n/a", not available. -What does that mean? -Good question. It seems there's no delivery date. So let's check if it has arrived at the airport. "ANVISA." That's what I'm saying, it's that way. See? "ANVISA". "ANVISA", it's this way. Hello...? -Is there any good news? -Yes, not that bad. -Come on in. -Excuse us. -There's always something, right? -What do you mean by "not so bad". Actually, there was problem. Because the package said "ANVISA", they had to confirm it again on their system in order for it to be updated. But they told me that it would arrive within 24h. So it was FedEx fault? Yes, at first, but it was solved. -So it was it was the IRS? -No, no. -It's wrong. -I know, just wait a minute. Let's take it slow. It didn't arrive here. There was a small problem. -Why do we require the IL? -The Importing License... Yes, every medicine must have a number. This way, we know the recipient's name so we can prevent a trading business to set in. So, with IL, will it arrive in airports to? Yes, it will arrive in airports. What about cities that do not have an airport, Ricardo? The question is not the airport itself, the problem is if there's not an IRS office there, and the office is located in the airport. We're speaking the same language, but I still don't get the IL thing. What happen is that this was a court decision, so we had to comply with it and approve. -So it was a matter of... -You had to approve it? We had to approve it, and we did all it was necessary. -Let's hope it arrives, then. -But it already has! Well, it just didn't get to the proper place! -It was inspected... -We've got to have faith. It's very simple, there won't be any problem. The issue is that this substance is not just controlled, it's forbidden here. So it shouldn’t have gotten in. -We'll come back tomorrow, then. -No, I'll call you. Thanks, Ricardo, see you. What's more important? A system for tracking down the products that arrive here or a child's life? MARIJUANA MARCH, 2014 SÃO PAULO MARIJUANA MARCH, 2014 RIO DE JANEIRO We have to stop being so hypocritical, we have to evolve! The Marijuana March is the greatest expression of our fight NO MORE HYPOCRISY against this absurd prohibition... "BRING AN END TO YOUR PREJUDICE." "CANNABIS MAY SAVE LIVES." We have to end this nonsense war... "CAN I GROW IT?" We have invited here a few mothers whose children have refractory epilepsy, and who cannot treat them through conventional means and have decided to treat them with marijuana. So let's welcome them and make them feel comfortable, because they are fighting for their children's rights. Thank you all. "CANNABIS MAY SAVE LIVES. THINK ABOUT IT." "REFRACTORY EPILEPSY NEEDS CBD NOW." We feel that things are finally getting started, they're not "virtual" anymore, they're real now. I t's a great support... ...A great psychological help to know that you are not alone. I think those mothers whose children need products that derive from cannabis in order to get treatment have joined the activists that are fighting for their rights. And that's a very important convergence. I've noticed the relation between cannabis and multiple sclerosis. I cannot be outside the law anymore, while using low-quality products. I know things are slow, but, for me, it's horrible to wait. It's amazing the ignorance that some doctors and scientists show regarding the biological process associated with marijuana and our body's reaction to it. I don't think it's controversial for people to seek health or well being. It's unbelievable that someone finds this controversial. I hope people start to realize that we are serious. Life does not wait. At first, we started to research cannabidiol. We got better informed about it. Soon we met some people who smoked it. People who would benefit from its use and relied on it. The question was not Anny's supply anymore. It was the use of medical marijuana in the treatment for many other diseases and no one wants to talk about it. THC is very important for those who are on chemo, for those who suffer from chronic pains... There's a whole list of diseases that could be treated with medical marijuana. THC is a compound found in marijuana that has psychoactive effects. It's responsible for other medical properties of the plant. What should I do? Let's see. "Try coloring number six." You already did, it's great. It's a rainbow. You have ballet class today. We find it incredible that she can walk, go to university, take care of two children. She sustained a serious back injury. She went through two surgeries to try to fix her vertebrae and straighten her bone marrow. They tried, but they didn't succeed. What happens is that her nerve roots are being crushed. I've tried every sorts of medication: anti-epileptic, anticonvulsants, some heavy medication, even morphine, which I used to consume a lot. I would use so much morphine, baclofen, and other sorts of strong medication, that I decided to get a morphine pump that would be connected directly to my brain. I can't find any similar cases, but I kept looking for something that could help me. Soon I found out about the use of marijuana for neurological pain. I started using it and the spasms decreased, stopped. Feeling pain became normal. When I don't feel any pain, it's what I need. Marijuana is the only thing that really helps me. It's the only drug that actually does it. When I went to extract my morphine pump, I realized it was something so unusual, that the procedure wasn't even listed on the health plan. There was the insertion, but not the extraction. Because once you're addicted, it's over. Ovarian cancer is one of the most aggressive ones Only 30 per cent of people survive. Thank God I was one of them. Hello. I was eight months pregnant when I started to feel severe pains around the ovaries. I went through a Cesarian. My daughter’s lung was malformed, so she was taken to the ER right away. Meanwhile I went through a hysterectomy and went home. So, a week later, I started doing chemo. It was one of the worst moments of my life, I felt like a truck had ran me over. I could barely open my eyes, from all the pain I was feeling all around my body. I wasn't hungry, I didn’t want to eat anything, I would force myself to eat fruits, juice, and other liquids, which, basically, I could digest without feeling nauseous. The person starts to lose weight and gets thinner and thinner. She couldn't even take water, which was her only "food". The pain and the sickness were terrible, but the psychological aspect was even worse. I was always afraid of dying and losing my daughter. She became so depressed, that she said "my newborn daughter is here, but I can't do anything". She barely had enough strength to get out of bed. We started to search for something that had any effect or improved chemo. Nothing the doctor prescribed actually worked. It was a surprise, I had no idea that marijuana could diminish the chemo's symptoms. I started to eat normally, I was hungry again. The fear I had, vanished, and I was normal. I had friends over again, I started to laugh, I would laugh while telling the story. For the first time she could get our daughter in her arms. She could finally enjoy being a mother. People don't understand that I smoke to kill the pain. I'm tired of smoking marijuana locked in the bathroom because of the neighbours, because of the smell, because of prejudice. There were some neighbours that stopped talking to me and even with my daughters due to this. I want to go to places, I want to be a part of society without people staring at me because I smoke marijuana. We started to research and we saw that some web pages that sold the seeds would say what type was the best one for what disease. So we gave it a shot. The desire of growing it was bigger than the fear. It was bigger than the fear Os the neighbours or the police. It was 07:30 AM when I came downstairs and I saw this woman get out of a car. After she confirmed my identity, she told me she was a bailiff. I was charged with international drug trafficking. I didn't have the right to bail or habeas corpus, anything. It's considered a heinous crime. After we went through everything, after my daughter and I had survived... He was charged with international trafficking. We couldn't believe that. National Congress Brasília These mothers have contacted this Human Rights Commission so they could talk with its members and ask for their support, since tomorrow they will talk to ANVISA. Now I will give the floor to one of these mothers. Come here, Katiele. Come on, both of you, have a seat. I'll give the floor to Margarete, who will talk about her experiences and motivations. I'm a mother and I represent a group of other mothers who use medical cannabis. We would like to ask for the support of this Commission, because this is a subject that's surrounded by prejudice. We're here to say that there is evidence and marijuana is neither an evil or a miraculous herb, it's a herb that has certain medical properties. So we would like to ask you to consider the issue without any prejudice. That's all. Thank you, Margarete and Katiele. -Congratulations for your bravery. -Thank you. -...of cannabis. -Medical. Just medical. We are talking only about medical... We need someone who can approach the issue of research. -Who does that? -The big manufacturers. The big manufacturers. My idea, which I will give to Jean Wyllys and Paulo Teixeira, is separate the discussions. We have to discuss the issues separately. -Have you told Jean Wyllys? -Not yet, but I will today. This is what I wanted to hear. Most people still have quite a bit of prejudice, and the MPs just want to keep their jobs. They want to be reelected. Why have I decided to start this project this year? Because it's election year. Everybody would talk about it, the press, the people, the whole country. I talked to the president, and he told me: "But this is a very tricky matter, why should we start a fight?" And I told him about the medical properties. "But the project cover more than that." "It's very vague. You see what Jean Wyllys has done?" He said it as if pointing out a huge mistake. So if we focus on the medical aspects we're likely to get 80 to 80 per cent of approval among all the MPs, even the evangelicals. I won't lie to you, I'm not a self-seeking. I won't tell you what you want to hear, even though someone else may already have. No, I just want the truth. I'll be honest, I'll not try to fool you. I cannot say that everyone here has the same opinion. -It's not true. -I wanted to talk about that. It's not true. ANVISA has approved the import Gustavo's medication. Have a look. Hey! Can you turn down the air-conditioner, please? Quite a few of my MP friends told me that if we focus on the medical aspects, they would support it, but not if the discussion was on general terms. This Congress is prejudiced against some things, just like society. Because society doesn't want to open its eyes. And neither do they, but we're getting there. It's hard work, that requires awareness. As for the legalization and regulation of marijuana, I intend to focus on the number of deaths, the number of homicides caused by the war on drugs. I'm fighting against discrimination of the poor population all over the country. The issue of marijuana is very important for that, so I decided that I would fight all those wrong notions and try to solve them. But I'm sure that today Cristóvão will approve it. -He won't be here today. -He won't? He's traveling. What a shame! Then I'll keep going anyway. It was good, right? It was very good! That was what I wanted. I think now we did it. We have to realize that these causes walk hand in hand. That is, to ensure the medical use, first we have to legalize it. I know I'll be selfish right now, but my focus, as a mother, is right here, right now. I want it now. You see, when I checked my phone, my daughter was at the hospital. I thought: "Fuck me!" Edit this out! If I were you, I would probably feel the same. "Jean Wyllys wants to legalize it". I know you want to discuss it all, and I'm all for it, but let's focus on this first, I need this fast. I can't separate the discussions, we have to talk about the whole subject. Our issue is with ANVISA. That's right, it's not here. 4th International Symposium on Medical Cannabis São Paulo My main cause is research. We take to the streets, we will make noise, we will do whatever is necessary, because my dream is to control my daughter's seizures. Here's the clinical study they want so much. Do something! Don't accept when someone tells you: "You see, there's nothing you could do about it." "There's nothing you could do." Do you know how devastating that is? So don't accept it, go ahead, fight for it! Now it's up to one of the directors of ANVISA the removal of cannabidiol from the list of substances that are currently forbidden here in Brazil. Should the doctor have any doubts, he can clarify it with the Council. It was a phone call, Katiele called and explained her situation, that she had to smuggle the drug to treat her daughter. It was something that really got to me. I even got a little shaken from seeing her here. It seems to me that what science couldn't accomplish, a mother could. As they demand a solution for their problem, they're doing politics, and that kind of attitude is starting to have an effect by changing a regulation, that the country has been denying to change for many years. To what extent does this sort of classification hurt democracy? Because we do not have the right to discuss how this plant is being classified. The vice-president of the Federal Council of Medicine claimed that they would never allow a Brazilian doctor to prescribe any kind of marijuana product. We have to abolish prejudice, we're losing a lot of time. What I want to talk about now is biological medicine. The thing is that we were forced to approve registrations of molecules whose phase 3 trial was concluded just two months ago. They are too recent, their future is unknown. We have to register them, though. But not cannabidiol. And why is that? Because the industry wants to approve them quickly. A treatment that costs over R$ 100 thousand a month is great. And the government pays for it... Yes, exactly. However, cannabidiol is much cheaper, it has no patent. Who would want it? These are the rules of their game. Not our rules, let me be clear. I'm saying it so you don't get mad. -Yes, I know. -She has a very short fuse. And there's one just like me, Camila, from Brasília. There are many others. Maybe there is knowledge, but there is no discussion, because there's no way of putting it into practice in a clinic. To discuss in theoretical terms is not common for us. When I was a kid, people would say: "That kid is a pothead!" This sort of things start, in people's and doctor's mind, since he was raised by this culture in Brazil, the fear of a drug that, essentially, will harm you. I think now we have to evolve even more. We have to hope for the best. The president of ANVISA said that the liberation of the compounds of the tree for therapy, will be studied by the end of this month. It's important to demystify. MEETING OF ANVISA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS - MAY 29TH, 2014. This is the result of a journey that started last October and which has brought us many difficulties, right? Many fears. Today is the day we take the first step. I think there's still a lot to fight for. What I want today is to eliminate the bureaucracy. If we do it, we'll be halfway there. And even if it gets to the C1 list, the doctors still have prejudice and lack of knowledge. to give a prescription. It's useless putting it on C1 without the prescriptions. And the main excuse is the fact that it's a forbidden substance, They don't want to prescribe something illegal. As of today it won't be anymore. What we're discussing here is the feasibility and the relevance of transferring one of the compounds found in the species Cannabis sativa to a list of controlled substances and what are the consequences of such procedure. Everything that represents a risk, might cause harm. Our mission is to protect people from those harms, because they will be exposed to the risks. Cannabidiol is one of the substances of cannabis and has been subjected a technical study. The classification of cannabidiol to the C1 list would not indicate that other substances would also be classified as such, let alone receive the same treatment, especially the THC. If a product leaves the US and comes to Brazil, we would have THC coming too. And the International Treaty does not consider if it is for medical purposes or not. The situation I have just exposed makes it very intricate for the direction board to consider the subject that is being discussed. What I am realizing now is that simply transferring cannabidiol from one list to another will be pointless regarding people's needs. A group of doctors still feel a little unsure about giving this sort of prescription. It's true that a decision like this would show society that it is possible to obtain substances from alternative means. But if ANVISA approves it, that would suggest people that things are quite easy and that everything is solved now, and it's not. -Is it over? -It was adjourned. I want to talk to you. Am I not allowed to talk to you? As mother, I have this right. How can you say that it's not worth it? The thing is, you should look for our complaints department... But they will simply listen to me, and I want you to talk to them for me. The number doesn't work! There's no demand because we can't get you to listen! I'm ashamed of being Brazilian. What you said about the lack of demand is not true! No, I said there was four requests in 2014... The number doesn't work! Wait, wait. If I were to ask you for an exception, ANVISA requires... ANVISA requires the prescription of a doctor in order for me to ask for an exception. Where am I going to find a doctor brave enough to put his own registration at risk for prescribing a substance that is officially forbidden? That's the question. I can't understand what was decided there or why they are not going to move it from the C3 list. It's absurd! Nobody can get a prescription for a prohibited substance. That's what they should explain, because he said there's no demand, but there are many mothers who are using a prohibited substance because they bring it illegally. And that number will go up! Everyday there will be more and more people doing it and giving that to their children without medical advice because of that ridiculous speech we heard there. I receive hundreds of messages every week and Margarete also receive hundreds. The mothers can't get the prescription because it's a prohibited substance. Of course! It's a vicious circle. So nobody can say that there's no demand. What I would like to say to ANVISA is that the amount of time it takes to carry out a clinical trial is much bigger than that of a mother whose child is having a seizure at a hospital bed. And I think that if their children had 80 seizures every week, if they had to consume CBD illegally, and if their children benefited from that, I'm sure that the clinical trial would be much faster. ANVISA's board of directors didn't remove cannabidiol from the list of prohibited substances. Camila couldn't stay until the end of the discussions. During the meeting, her son had a very serious seizure. He died 48 hours later. I don't blame ANVISA for the death of my son. But I deserved a faster solution, as well as every mother. As far as I know, even after this, bureaucracy is still there. Can't you see that our cause is urgent? They're putting lives on hold for political interests. It's ridiculous! It's absurd and unacceptable! What we have is a group of mothers trying to save their children. But there's also the apathetic government, ANVISA, which doesn't do anything, doctors, who don't prescribe, the Medicine Council, that still hasn't taken a stand... These mothers are all around, completely lost. They don't have time to wait. They can't ask their children to stand some more seizures because ANVISA is deciding what to do. I think we have to count on ourselves, because the truth is that we can't rely on the State. It's my pain. I'm the one who's sick and can't have a normal life. Why should the State tell me what's good for my pain? The government only cares about itself. If reality doesn't get to them, they won't look for it. The fact that people are creating pressure groups to inquire the authorities, that makes things much faster. They don't want power, they don't have a government plan, they just want to change one aspect of reality, and the Brazilian State won't allow it. Everything that has changed was confronted once. And if we don't do it, nothing will ever change. Anny! Let's take the medicine? Let's take the medicine? You're going to help daddy, right? Today she talks to us, she is more present. Who’s my little princess? Who? Her life changed a lot, and so did ours. Happiness has returned to our home. Today she laughs, it's amazing. She quickly turned her head when I made a noise. These are our impressions now, this is our vocabulary. Now she can clearly show when she's happy or not. It's really incredible that she is able to do all this. It's worth trying anything that might help, anything that might bring some relief to this people, their families, their children... Only people who live through it know how hard it is. So every time I receive a message from someone saying that they were able to buy it, somehow, either through traffic or an authorization from ANVISA, telling us that their children have gotten better, that there are fewer seizures now, that they are smiling again, that they're starting to walk... Because we know that no matter what a child might accomplish, that will always be a moment of joy. I think it's a long way, that requires a lot of persistence. From everyone. You can't just give up. I have the right for a less bureaucratic country and an administration that is less stupid. It's my right. We want this to be fast, because our clock goes faster than that of politics. So we want it to be quick. But it's already a fact: There's no coming back. I would like to see people choosing their own treatment. That's what I hope for the future. Thaís' cancer hasn't come back. Jairo is waiting to be trialed for International Drug Trafficking. Juliana became the first Brazilian to be legally allowed to import nabixinols, an extract from marijuana that contains THC. Camila accepted to take part in this movie even after the death of her son, Gustavo. He was the first person to legally import cannabidiol, without having to appeal to the Judiciary. Margarete formalized APPEPI and became an important activist on the battle for the regulation of medical marijuana. It has been five months since Anny's last seizure. In the semester that followed her injunction, ANVISA issued 74 authorizations allowing her to import cannabidiol. This movie is dedicated to Gustavo Guedes and everyone fighting for their rights.
