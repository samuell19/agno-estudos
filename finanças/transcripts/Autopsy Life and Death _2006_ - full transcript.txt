How do you imagine your own death? Will it be peaceful? Will it be quick? Will you be old? Our death is a mystery to us. We cast it as an outsider, a thief, robbing us of our breath in an instant without warning. But death is less mysterious than he imagined. Its origins are in our genes, in the things that happened to us in what we do all day in this series, I will show you how the two causes of your death can be found in the way you are designed and the way you live your life. Lesson one-- Blood. And investigation, including a live dissection of a human body into how diseases of the circulatory system caused death. It's often said that life hangs by a thread and the sense of this is certainly true in this series, we're going to be using real human anatomy to show you some of the diseases that can intrude into our lives. But far from being a catalog of doom and gloom, understanding what can go wrong with our bodies actually gives us a stronger basis for looking after ourselves. Now, I said that life hangs by a thread, but if we were going to be less poetic but more accurate about it, what we should say is that life hangs by a tube, in fact, by thousands of them. In this program, we're going to be looking at the tubes, make up our circulatory system and what happens when these tubes go wrong. And all those tubes all together run two times to create off earth and here in this specimen originated from a body donor. You see all those fine little Atari's running through the debate here and the lips down and coming out here and the veins like to be seen here in the leg. So what this really impressive specimen shows is that embedded in our bodies is an amazing system of plumbing. And I can perhaps point out one or two features of it here. We have large vessels emanating from the heart, such as the aorta, which the pointer is on now, which are for distributing the blood around the body. And then we have small, large vessels such as this vessel here, the carotid artery in this vessel here, the vertebral artery, which are responsible for supplying the blood to particular organs. These two arteries on each side supply all the blood to the brain and head. So obviously, if the blood stops flowing through those arteries, the brain and head are in trouble. Or here's another example down here. The common iliac artery going down to the leg, supplies all the blood to the leg. So, again, if that artery got blocked up, the leg would have problems. If I can have a close up of this area here, I could just point out a couple of other details to you on the plasma screen. You can see some smaller vessels called capillaries, capillaries coming from a Latin word, meaning hair, because they're very, very fine. And the next picture on the plasma screen shows you some dilated capillaries in the skin. This is what the blood circulation is all for, to get the blood to these small vessels, which is where the exchange takes place. And the red blood cells are there inside the small vessels. These vessels are so small that you could fit 100 of them side by side on the head of a pin. There's nowhere in our body that's very far away from the capillary. So this is what the circulatory system is all about. Let's now examine the circulatory system in a patient we believe died as a result of diseases of the circulation. And this 84 year old lady is now on this table for some dissection, for reasons of anonymity. We have covered her face with a mask. She lost her weight and her mother had used to fight. But we wouldn't expect something else. In the age of 84, at least I would be happy to be alive and in such shape when I am reaching that age. And now I like to start dissection without any delay. Please us in. Mice come in with a dissection table with our instruments so we can start the dissection of this fresh, not fixed body. So in this dissection, we'll be examining the inside of her circulatory tubes to see what can go wrong with them and what consequences this may have for the body. I will open the body in an oval shape. And finally, in one flap, I will open this thoracic shield together with abdominal wall and turn it over to my side. I will start now. I will take a few minutes. And I have opened those abdominal thoracic cavity. I have to go a little bit deeper. When I do the cut here across the. Rips the sternum, I cannot accidentally cut any organ. I cut his suit muscles, pectoral muscle. So we see some subcutaneous fat tissue, fat tissue looks yellowish, and I will start here now. To cut through the holes. The whole sickness of the abdominal wall and then I am about to feel the intestine and indeed here I feel already the intestine. OK, there is real osteoporosis, the bones have lost calcium. It's possible with my scissors just to cut through the ribs, which I could certainly do in a younger body, like in Mice body. Actually, you're younger. You dissect me. So now I need. Now it's specialized leap. What is this? So no. This is a specialized Rip's town here, and in just a moment, we have opened the flat. And you can see the bright yellow color of fat in the body there in the slightly more salmon colored mussels exposed to the. Intimate, can you take it over? These are the rips from the inside. This is some fit, more fit than expected from the outside inside's is said there should be a heart. Left lung, right lung. I cut here through the diaphragm, so I've opened now the. Abdominal thoracic cavity. And it's time now to look for the vessels. While the dissection is continuing, let me give you a very simple demonstration of the consequences of narrowing of arterial tubing. We have here a very simple model to demonstrate this, the container at the top represents our arterial system and we have two tubes here representing an artery in my right hand and a diseased narrowed artery in my left hand. The trouble with narrowing of arteries is that flow through the artery is very dependent on the diameter. So narrowing of the artery substantially reduces the flow to the affected organ. So let me demonstrate this to you now. But I'll show you containers underneath and I'll fill up our circulatory system. It's a red fluid representing blood. Yeah, and now I'll just let the blood flow through to arteries. You can see the tube on the right is a narrow diameter. So if I can stop the flow just in time. You can see that there's a lot more fluid has flown out through the normal artery as we're having it than through the narrow artery, and the importance of understanding this in the context of disease is one of the commonest diseases of human beings has exactly this consequence. That's the disease known as hardening of the arteries, arteriosclerosis, or pathologists call it Arthur Roemer. This can cause the lining of the arteries to become rough and irregular and narrowed, and this can cause arteries in the bodies to narrow. As we can show you some examples, a more common expression for other ailments, arteries, sclerosis. And when you're putting in place a collection of a cut open from several body donors at different age, then what we see here, this is an open abdominal order from an 18 years old here. Both sides of those arteries going to the pelvis, iliac arteries. And here are those shoot offs which go to the liver, to the bowels, 10 years later, 35 years. You see already some irregularities in the ward, some arteries close, some incapacitation of calcium. And it is close now at the age of 50. Is here to see atherosclerosis sclerotic Plax called here even more severe and at the age of 60, when you drink a little bit alcohol, when you do sports, when you have good genes, it may be stay like that. But here it's already advanced at its closest C. At this election of all here, even as rumbas. And what you also see could accomplish nothing. Show me in the outside disease that they are really distended from the outside. This one would like about in this way, but a healthy one is. About that scene, so I am here in the middle, so this would be about my size. And finally, when this gets more and more severe at this close to lakes, may not get enough blood. You may even get a graft, an artificial connection between the aorta of the abdomen and the legs in order that the legs don't have to be amputated. Let me share this process a little bit more detail in a couple of photographs taken down the microscope. This shows an artery which would originally have had a diameter indicated by this outer red line here, but the process of hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis has caused calcification indicated by these dark areas and thickening of the wall of the artery so that now the space in the middle is substantially narrowed. And this will have the effect of restricting the flow through this artery to the organ that's affected if I could have the next plasma screen image. This is one of the problems with this narrowing. Not only is the flow reduced normally, but there's a worry that the blood clot in the artery during life and this is called a thrombus. So on this image of two arteries from the heart, you can see the one over here is still got an open middle with blood can flow, but the one on this side has got blood clot in it, occupying most of the space in the middle of the artery, apart from this little irregular space in the middle. And obviously, this would have had disastrous consequences for the heart that this artery supplied. In part two, a demonstration of those disastrous consequences, the dissection specimen is used to show what happens to the heart when coronary arteries are obstructed. Arteriosclerosis has been described next, preparations begin for a demonstration of its consequences. The dissection specimen will be used to simulate an obstruction to normal blood flow. The larger order which comes from the heart and goes to both legs, septum, auto, we identified exactly here. And we like edited in with this tube, so like it is just a medical term, meaning that something is tied off in order to show you the consequences of lack of blood flow to an organ in the body, we're first removing the blood from this body so that we can then subsequently put a silicone polymer back in and show you the effects of lack of flow and what we are about to do now, we will flow flush in the water. And it this very flush to blood out through the arteries, through the capillary bed, coming out of the vein. In this way, all the organs will more or less lose its color because the reason the lung is already liver is so dark, it's a blood, the organ by itself look pale. Therefore, it start now with putting some water in and all the blood will go out. Careful, careful, you don't want to explode our bodies or not. So why are we just waiting for that process to complete? Let me show you some of the commonest arteries affected by this disease process of hardening of the arteries. And we have here Julietta anatomical artist is drawn on Denis's our live model today, an outline of the arterial system. And some of these arteries supply the organ, which depends on them. For example, these arteries supplying the head. These arteries here supply the bowel, these supply the kidneys, the supply, the legs. And all four of those sites are susceptible to narrowing to an extent that can damage the organ that they supply. Now, we tend to think of the heart as just a pump that pumps the blood around the circulation. But the heart also needs energy and it also needs to own vascular supply, its own supply of blood. And it gets these from to quite narrow arteries called the coronary arteries. And if one of these gets narrowed, the consequences can be disastrous. I can show you this over on the plasma screen. The coronary arteries or the artery supplying the heart are quite narrow to start with, and if they get damage to the lining, which causes either narrowing of the artery or a blood clot to form in the artery, the supply to the bit of heart muscle that that artery was responsible for stops altogether. And in the heart, there are no other arteries that supply that particular bit of muscle to that particular bit of heart muscle will then die, as I can show you in the next picture. He we have some normal heart muscle where you can see the muscle fibers and these little blue dots are the nuclei of the cells, and on this side, the heart muscle has died as a result of the blood flow being stopped and indeed inflammation, which these little blue dots is beginning to come in and dissolve the heart muscle. Heart muscle that's dead like this won't function anymore. So the heart can't pump properly. And indeed, it may suffer an arrhythmia, an electrical impulse which stops it acting as a pump. And that will be manifest as a heart attack. That's when the heart stops working as a pump and the blood supply went to the whole body fails. So the heart is really a key organ in this in this story. Well, let's have a look now and try and illustrate this process of lack of blood supply to the heart on our dissection specimen. Now, look how spectacular pale the organs have become here. The lung virtually wiped because the blood away the liver here, the intestine. Everything pale except for the thin, especially here covering the heart, which is yellow. No, we want to do the opposite. We don't remove blood. We were putting in new artificial blood. The new artificial blood, Mice you put something up, stop, please go ahead. So I will stop now the flow of the water, because no blood coming out anymore. Everything here is white. I call it now the ultraviolet light, because within this reason, we have mixed some unique pigment, so we should see it much more pronounced, not only red. Now, I will do something very special when the blood comes. I like to simulate an infection. I like to clamp with a tiny clip. I like to clamp one coronary artery in the front I see already one. Let's go the other way in here. The camera can see it here. Should go in here and I take the heart to the back and I see here another coronary artery and here I see important artery. So we're going to place a clip over one of the arteries supplying part of the heart muscle and then put the polymer into all the other arteries. And this will mimic an infarction or the situation where blood doesn't reach part of the heart. So I will do it here. I clampitt here, OK? And on the other side, I always clamp the right coronary artery. OK, I go here now to the left coronary artery and the right coronary artery is somewhere here in the depths. I'm not sure that I see even one moment, that's the second, yeah, wonderful Up perfect here. Yeah, don't playing clamp in case the heart doesn't work, it may have to. I would like to put a big clamp here into the mesentery to those vessels that actually nourish the intestine. So this part of the intestine should not become red you will see. Now Mice. Let's go to give me the artificial blood that's artificial about coming. Yeah. Come in and I go here into the water. And now it's a very decisive moment of this operation and anxious. OK, ok, ok, OK. Now is a big moment is imminent, so I open here, I open their Mice, please. And now let's have a look. It takes some time. The blood flows now. So they all take to the heart for all the major arteries and should very soon come up. The tension can be not beaten by any football player or soccer player, even not by the Olympics. This is something very special, great and wonderful. Yes, yes. When you look now on the plasma screen, you see the wheaty going. Its path is a coronary artery. You mentioned at the beginning, little tubes by which life hangs in here. You can see some in the heart full of UV dye. These are the small tubes of which the heart muscle depends which nourishment. And if these are blocked and the flow doesn't happen, then the muscle will die. Now, I want to show you the other part of the heart here, where I put in the clamp there is no you will die in this area. And you can see here the clamp to stop the flow of polymer through the artery in the lower part where you can see some evidence, it's a bit patchy because of the fattiness of this heart. Now, I want to show you that actually all the organs are infused with a right lung within the liver to a good extent, injected again. And we also see here the power with all its arteries filled up with artificial blood. This time, again, if we can have a close up of that part of the intestine. It's a very striking comparison here. You can see between this fold of intestine, which has been fused with the red polymer and the white unary perfused part at the top there where we clamp the arterial supply. So the the blood flow, the blood flow has come back into this lower segment, not into the upper segment, which remains white. And when the blood supply to part of an organ is completely stopped, that's called ischemia a word, meaning lack of blood flow to that particular part of the organ. And when that happens, that part of the organ then dies. And now I want to show you the consequences of Kimock heart disease. In some person, it's not what you come in, please. And what you see on this table, there are a number of heart. So this is a normal heart. It could be my heart, nice, small about the size of my fist. And then, you know, look at this incredibly big heart when I open this. You see, it's not healthy here. This area is not infused his blood. This is ischemia. There is an area of heart infarction, and I can show you what this looks like under the microscope on the plasma screen, where you can see some remnant heart muscle in these red areas and in between a white, pale area of scarring. Now, about a quarter of us will die of the effects of this type of damage to the heart and a heavy heart with severe scarring here. When you compare just from the outside, it's a healthy, small, lovely heart here. And this diseased heart, you see a scarring on the outside. And now when I open this heart, look on the healthy side here. Very even signees, about 110 meters, as it should be, and here it has a Senning also, you see that the shape of the heart is distorted because it's arrogated and here the wall is very thin. This is a scar exactly here and now. Look inside. Wonderful, red, healthy, beautiful. But here, this person, he didn't die from his heart, in fact, but he escaped narrowly death. But all too often, a heart, in fact, has a much more dramatic result it results in death, as in this unhappy body donor, on my left side, right side, and we did it cut and have now a transparent plastinated slice from him. And now look. His lung surrounding the heart. The right part of the heart and here the left part, which comes to blood into the body, and here here is a crime story going on. You see here a Upshaw you see the bleeding and all this blood went out into the pericardial sac, about this space in this space which surrounds the heart. And finally, as I can show you in a slice of this unhappy lady. The blood goes out of the heart because this is against the heart and you see the black blood and the blood. Is going inside this space again and the heart pumps and pumps, it actually is drowning in the blood which surrounds it. Finally, within minutes, this person died. In part three, the heart is dissected to establish whether arteriosclerosis killed this patient. Her body is used to illustrate another way in which arteries can become obstructed. And a simple demonstration reveals what happens when arteries burst. A demonstration has shown that when blood flow to an organ is blocked, the consequences can be devastating. Now it's time to find out whether this woman's arteries were obstructed by arteriosclerosis. John, would you join me? I'd like to cut open the heart. It is popularity muscle the inside the heart, which pumps the blood into the body. And from here, I go out. And I cut the aorta. Which I just enter here. Come on here, look, these are actually the valves and I open the coronary artery. With this small scissors. And now listen to this noise, this noise is calcium calcifications, severe atherosclerosis. A perfect now to see come, please John come here look. This now is the inner side of the left heart pumping the blood into the body. This is aortic valve and he is in terms of the coronary artery and opening this coronary artery shows. He distinct are sclerotic plucks exactly here. These are the yellow areas you can see in the red wall of the artery there in the artery is healthy. It looks like that here when that close looks like that. Let's look now in the water and go back to coronary artery and go back. I go back here to the border between the heart. And they all and the other shows he has, those little white patches says, is the artist roses here, here, here, here. This is artist roses and this is more marked, which is very normal down. In the abdominal part here in the abdominal cavity, again, these are just clothes and those whitish areas here with some alterations, some don't. Look how striking this is. Roses here shows up here even with some world effects, some alterations. So we can see three basic areas here, the relatively normal wall of the inside of the aorta here, these fatty streaks and calcified plaques, which are the white and yellow areas here, and an area of ulceration, which is where the arteriosclerosis burst through the normal lining of the aorta and caused some blood clotting inside the aorta. And before I showed you this on the press it, and these are exactly those ulcerations and Kathak to see, it couldn't be shown better. So we've been able to demonstrate to you arteriosclerosis in our dissection specimen and we've shown you how it can damage the inside wall of the artery and lead to blood clotting. But there's an even more dramatic way in which blood clotting inside the arterial system in life can cause a problem. And this is called embolism. I can demonstrate to that to you on our live model here, Dennis, there are two fundamentally different ways in which embolism a clot breaking off inside the body and going around the circulation can occur. One of them, which we can start with, can happen on the basis of a heart attack. Sometimes following a heart attack, a blood clot can form on the interior wall of the heart and grow and then break off. And when that happens, it can be pumped out of the heart round the aorta until it gets stuck in one of the smaller arteries, for example, perhaps going down these arteries here, which supply the upper bowel causing death of the upper bowel or into one of these arteries here, which supply the kidneys, causing death of a kidney or part of the kidney, or even more catastrophically, it can pass up into the blood vessels supplying the head and cause death of part of the brain. A completely different type of embolism happens when you get a blood clot in your legs. This can happen for a variety of reasons. It's associated with air travel. Sitting on an airplane with your legs in a cramped up position for many hours can cause a blood clot to form in the veins of the leg. And it is then subsequently breaks off. It can travel up from the leg into the right side of the heart, through the right side of the heart and into the lungs, blocking off some of the pulmonary circulation, the circulation to the lungs. And if this is a big enough clot, it's one of the relatively few causes of instant death. I think we can see a very simple demonstration of embolism back on the dissection specimen. Well, when the come on would come in exactly here, here is the artery which goes through the pelvis and here and here runs in the leg. And now I take an ambulance, some blood and I. Inserted here into this artery. A final push now by my syringe with water simulating the blood flow. And now. Stop. Now, the Emperor's travel its way and I will open. The artery and signed it where it traveled. Here it is, yeah, you've got it. Perfect. Now, when this would have in life, the blood flow would be exactly here and the lake would not have blood supply, emergency operation, or this patient would lose his leg. So we can see on the plasma screen here that are not embolism has traveled along the artery and it's got embedded here. And it's like turning the artery. And in life, there would be no flow distance to that part. And so the part of the body in this case, the leg distant to that part, would have no blood supply and would gradually, over an hour or two die. And this would be a surgical emergency. It is possible to remove it surgically if they're known about, but it has to be done within a very short time. Well, we've seen how hardening of the arteries can cause narrowing of the arteries and can cause blockage of the arteries. But there's another thing that can happen to tubes. As any plumber can tell you, they can burst. And hardening of the arteries can also contribute to that because it can weaken the wall of an artery sufficiently to cause it to dilate and then burst. And I can illustrate the process to you here on the plasma screen. With a microscopic picture of a weakened area of the wall of an artery and the dark colors here. Are the original wall of the artery on this side and on this side, but round here where there should be a continuous arterial wall, there are only small residual part of the artery wall and the rest has been completely replaced. The wall has been completely replaced by a blood clot. And you can easily imagine how this area would be quite susceptible to rupture, to bursting. Well, I can illustrate this for you very schematically with a simple demonstration. This tube here represents an artery like they oughta, and the white bits at either end represent the normal arterial wall with the red bit in the middle being the thinned and weakened part of the arterial wall due to arteriosclerosis. Well, let's see what happens if I blow it up. As the war dilates, the pressure in the war increases. Until eventually. Sometimes after considerable time. It ruptures now, of course, a ruptured aneurysm in the body doesn't make a noise like that, but the consequences can be equally dramatic. Sometimes the patient hears this noise and they die within hours. I recall such a case from my clinical time, and I want to demonstrate now Nadine could you bring me some plastinated exactly this kind of aneurisms. As you just demonstrated, in real place tonight in real specimen's, so this is a young auto. I would like to have and this is already I order 70 about. And when you cut this open before I showed you advance notice, close with already some ulceration, some blood clot here when this continues. It looks like that not only. One place, this blood clot, several, and here it is already in a small aneurysm and here and here, blood clots here, blood clots here. And I turn it around. You see all those buildings. OK, now the most severe aneurysm I found. In this unhappy paternal. To illustrate to you, this is a heart. Opened and this is say Orta, say Auto which. And a healthy person look again like that, and now look at that, a bulging an aneurysm, thinning of the bone bulging here and there is no one there's another one here and there is another one, the big one here. Look at this one from the big one, big bulging here, one bulging here and one bulging here. And all this is filled up with clotted blood. And now it's time for questions on everybody who has a question will raise his arm, please. I would like to ask, why do people get a heart attack when they have a sudden shock? If you get a sudden shock, you get a sudden burst of adrenaline into the blood and that can increase the excitability of the heart, but in hearts that are already disease, that increased excitability can cause an arrhythmia to happen so the heart can stop acting like a pump. And in fact, there's a large collection of examples of the fact that it's entirely true that you can die of a sudden shock causing a sudden stop in the in the heart. One of the most unfortunate examples that I know somebody had a heart attack and died when he got a hole in one in golf. Ok next questions, so let's go right in front, please. This evening has all been about blood flowing and I'm quite pleased my blood is flowing nicely and my veins. But athletes are sometimes accused of taking drugs with always being accused of taking drugs, was accused of taking drugs to thicken their blood. Doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me. Can you help, John? Well, yes, blood has a normal consistency, which it's designed to have and which helps it to flow around the body. And if you don't have as many blood cells in your blood, that's the condition of anemia or thin blood. You don't carry as much oxygen around the body and the therefore the tissues don't get as much oxygen supply. What you're talking about is the opposite situation where people take drugs to increase the amount of blood cells in their blood and therefore to supply more oxygen to their tissues and hope to enhance athletic performance. The downside to this is that it also makes their blood thicker and less likely to flow and more likely to clot in the system. So although it may work in the short term, it's actually really rather a dangerous thing to do, too, with thick blood. I'm better performing, but with thin blood I sometimes faint and but I live longer. That may be the case. Next question, please. This gentleman over there, if you have the bad luck and get an ambulance, for instance, in your leg, how will be the treatment? How long time do you have that it can be treated and what will be done in that case? It depends how large the ambulance is, whether some side flow is allowed. In the worst case, you have to rush to the hospital in minutes, let's say, in a maximum of one hour, and then there's an opportunity, a possibility to dissolve this blood clot. I ask because on long distance flights, you're always you always have to take care and wear compression socks and something like that. The reason why you're susceptible to them on long flights is because of pressure really on the back of your legs. And anything that changes the flow of blood in a vessel can predisposed to clotting and in this case, pressing on the back of your legs to predisposed to clotting in the back of your legs, which is why it's recommended that, A, he keep well hydrated on flights. You drink lots of water, you don't drink too much alcohol. And secondly, you get up and walk around every so often because that helps the blood flow through your veins, back to the heart and not to clot in them. OK, thank you. And then more questions over there. Please go ahead. What needs to be done to avoid an early atherosclerosis or even to prevent severe atherosclerosis in old age? Yes, well, that's a good question. And in fact, there are things we can do to look after our arteries. And I can explain that to you by using Dennis, our live model again. Here we've got a projection of our arterial system and the main organs and the reason why diseases of the arterial system are so important is because the arteries go everywhere. They're required to supply all of our organs and all of our organs can be in trouble without an arterial supply. The commonest organs that are affected by this lack of supply are the brain, in which case you get a stroke, the heart in which case you can get a heart attack. The kidneys can be affected with multiple small scars or bigger ones, and the bowel can also be affected. And sometimes, as we've seen, the blood flow can be blocked off to the legs. Well, what are the main risk factors for this disease if at the moment what actually predisposes to the most important one and the one that's easiest to do something about? Well, unless you're too addicted to smoking, smoking is a major risk factor for a thorough. It causes it throughout the body and it causes it to accelerate and appear at a younger age. So not smoking is a good thing and stopping smoking is a good thing if you want to look after your arteries. The second thing that's important is blood pressure. The blood pressure determines how much energy is transferred to the inside of the arteries. Every time the heart beats, so the your blood pressure, the more of a pounding the inside of your arteries get and the more likely they may be to develop an aroma. And that's why after you reach your 40s or 50s, it's a good idea to have your blood pressure checked by the doctor every so often because there are these days very effective drugs for lowering blood pressure into the normal range and again, protecting our arteries. And the third thing that's important is the type of fats, the type of lipids that are circulating in your blood. And there are two ways you can find out about that. One is that if you've got a family history of arterial disease somewhere in the body of stroke or heart attack happening at a young age, you should have a blood test because you can find out whether or not you're predisposed to that. Again, if you are, there are drugs that can know the lipids. And secondly, you can have a blood test randomly to see whether or not you have high lipids. This indeed is a quite unusual program. And some of you may have been frightened in the beginning, but fortunately enough, nobody frightened to death. Even you learn something to prevent this, to live longer. And therefore, I thanks you everybody and the see themselves plastinated as late as possible. Thank you.
