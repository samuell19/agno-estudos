Go ahead, get it up, Go ahead, go ahead, - I think we need a little review, Remember how I tagged everything by the room it's supposed to go in? - Yes, Mom, Yes, Mom, - So, if it's marked "K-I-T" it goes into the-- - Kitchen, - Good one, - Thank you, Debbie, And if it's marked "1-KID-B-R" it goes into the-- - First kids bedroom, - Thank you, Becky, - Nice work, - So, why am I finding boxes in rooms they're not supposed to go in? Yes, Jonathan? - I can't read, I don't know where stuff goes, - Hmmm, - All right, well, maybe some of you older ones can help him, okay? We're in this together, we've moved before, Yeah, - All right, Let's go! All right, You wanna grab that box? Goes in the kitchen! Right into the kitchen, Okay? Perfect, - I'm sorry, Mom, - That's okay, Mary, - You are amazing, I forgot you knew how to whistle like that, - Well you can take the girl out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the girl, Mm-hmmm, So, this goes into the basement? - You put that in the basement, I'll put you in the basement, * Take the name of Jesus with you * * Child of sorrow and of woe * It will joy and comfort give you * * Take it then wherever you go - As you all know, we've been searching for a pastor for quite awhile, We're so excited to have him and his family here as they help grow our congregation, Let's pray, Lord Jesus, I just thank you for Pastor Albert, I thank you for his wife Aimee, and I thank you for their lovely family, I pray your blessing upon our congregation as you lead Pastor Albert to lead us in your ways through his gifted teaching and his anointed leadership, Father we just thank you and praise you, In Jesus name, Amen, Amen, - Church! The Andersons! - My family and I feel extremely blessed to be here, We felt a calling to come, We felt led to this beautiful town, After our first meeting with Chris and the rest of the board, Aimee and I went home and we prayed with our six wonderful children, The Lord led us to Isaiah 43, verses 16-21, - Mom, can the kids and I go play outside? Mrs, Reese said it was okay, - Of course, Have fun, - Let's go, - Grab your plates guys, - Thank you, Mrs, Reese, It was yummy, - You're welcome, Thank you so much, - You're welcome, You have such wonderful children, They seem to truly love and respect each other, - Thank you, we're really proud of them, - Well, that just comes from good parenting, and God's grace, - We're really glad you're here, Are we gonna see a revival in this town anytime soon? - Well, I certainly hope so, Always be ready to preach the Gospel, in season and out, - We're going to get along just fine, Pastor, - We really want to see you succeed here, so any support we can give you, let us know, - Oh, that's sweet, - Thank you, we really appreciate that, - Do you like fishing, Albert? - Are we still talking spiritually, or? I mean actual fish, - Well, I don't get to often, but yes I do, - We have a houseboat down at the marina and we'd love to have you come join us this Saturday, If you're available, - That would be great! - Absolutely, the kids would love that, - Well then, it's set! - I'm gonna have to find my rod, Yeah, - Thank you all so much for coming out this evening, Aimee and I thought that we would do just a basic marriage seminar to all help up to get to know each other and our stories a bit better as well, Sound good? - Now Aimee would say that our marriage is a love story, Right, Sweetheart? - Right, - I always get a little nervous when I ask that question, Hollywood would lead us to believe that a love story takes place in two hours or less, but a real love-- - Albert leaned over and whispered, "I have something for you, Aimee," My heart was fluttering, - And so was mine, Gentleman, you'll appreciate this one, One hot summer afternoon, Aimee decided to help out with the yard work, - Albert! - What? It's a funny story, Yeah, to you, - Okay, well, needless to say, Aimee got angry with the lawn mower, - Ladies, when It comes to making decisions, being a marriage partner comes with great responsibility, - Now Gentlemen, the Seahawks didn't just walk out onto that field and collect those Superbowl rings, now did they? A real marriage takes a lot of effort, It has to be nurtured, worked, and fought for, Bade, your wife said you wanted to chat with us? - Yeah, well I just want to tell you my wife and I both really liked your talk, - Nancy mentioned that, - Gonna need your help, I can tell you that, You may regret it someday, but we really do need your help that's for sure, - Okay, well, if you want to call the office and set up an appointment, we'll see what we can do, - Will do, - That was interesting, - The devil's in that one, Excuse me? - Well, I mean, there's just something not quite right about him, - We need to be careful, Chris, Well, maybe he just really needs our help, - Other pastors have tried, It's lead to nothing but trouble, And, I want you to know, you did a good job tonight, Nice job, - Thank you, - And that was interesting, - We need to pray for grace, Really? Yeah, Chris did that? Yeah, Well, I had no idea, - It took him months to live down that title, - That is some great ammunition for the next board meeting though, thank you, - Yeah, - So, how are you enjoying your retirement? - It's different all right, Still just as busy though, Between the house, new boat, the yard, kids, grandkids, All the church activities, of course, - Yeah, you know I've been meaning to say something about that, You know, most people check out when they retire, but you two? You're still just as involved, I love that, - Well God has a reason for us to still be here, And it's not just to serve ourselves, I want to hear "well done," not "well done until the last mile," - I like that, I like that a lot actually, You mind if I use that in one of my sermons? - Oh, go right ahead, - Oh! Oh, I think I got one, Oh! Hang on to him! Hang on to him! Oh, he's pulling on it! All right, Bring it in slowly, I'll pull mine in, The kids are going to be happy, We're gonna have dinner tonight! - Thank you so much for having us here, It's a perfect day, - Isn't it? I can't think of a better way to get to know our new friends, - So, tell me more about growing up as a pastor's daughter, Maybe I'll learn some things I can help my own kids with, - Oh, honey, your kids are great, They're a joy and blessing to us, believe me, - Thank you, But seriously, anything? - Well, times are different now, There'll always be someone who has an opinion about you and your family, constantly under a microscope, Everyone will be looking to you, to your kids, to see how their kids should behave, Either way, listen to the Lord, Let God be your strength and grace, - I've never had anyone I could confide in that might understand what it's like, - Oh, Well you're welcome, I'll be praying for you, - Fervently, I hope, - Is there any other way? - I don't think so, Mom! Dad's back! - You go it? Look, Dad caught a fish! - Hey, look at this, Eh? - Wow, Dad, that is a big one! - It is, Yeah, you want to touch it? Slimy, isn't it? How about you Mark, you want to touch it? Yeah, woe, look at you! - Dad, can we catch another one and keep it as a pet? - Oh, bless her heart, - Hey, that looks pretty good, - Thanks, - You know if this whole pastoring thing doesn't work out, you might want to consider becoming a butcher, - Thanks, honey, - You're welcome, Today was a good day, - It was, - They're a real Godsend, - Mm-hmm, - You don't think so? - Well, of of course I do, I think they're great, - But? - It's just,,, We need to be careful, Look, I know you think the world of Francine, And I feel the same way about Luke, But, people can get jealous if they get the idea that the pastor and or his wife think more highly of someone else, - But that's not-- - I know, We didn't run into anything like this at Mountain View, but I think there are definitely some jealousies to contend with here, - All right, I'll be careful, - Thank you, - Speaking of careful, - Hmmm? - That couple the other night at the seminar, - The Blake's? - Yeah, What was that all about? - Yeah, I'm not sure what to make of that yet, You know Bade really seems to be searching for something, but I'm wondering if there might be some mental issues there as well, Maybe there's something I can do to help, - I love you, - Now that is not fair, - What? - I'm covered in fish guts, - I don't care, - Oh, you don't, huh? Come back here you! - I do! I do care! I do care! - You know we all come from different seasons in our lives right now, Some of us are still changing diapers and planning play dates, While others, Faye, I know you have a child going off to college in the fall, But it doesn't stop us being concerned for their safety, I have grown children and I still worry about them, Our nurturing and caring doesn't turn off like a faucet just because they leave the nest, It's a constant struggle, That's where Hannah had it right, placing Samuel in Eli's care, in the Lord's house, If we can do that then we can we truly focus on just loving our kids, It was wonderful, - Isn't Hannah amazing? Yes, absolutely, It helps us to really focus on our children, Thank you for hosting, - Sure, it was my pleasure, Oh, that's a good idea, Would you ladies excuse me? - Oh, certainly, - Thank you, Aimee, are you all right? - I'm fine, - Oh, you can talk to me, honey, What's the matter? - Albert's concerned about our friendship, - Did I do something wrong? - No, no, not at all, He's just worried that other women in the congregation might get jealous if it looks like I'm favoring you, - I've seen that happen in churches more often than I'd like to mention, Albert's wise to bring it up, Oh, we'll figure this out, I have to tell you, God brought you into my life to remind me of something I really needed reminding of, We'll work it out Aimee, - Thank you, Thank you for being such a great friend, - Come on, God brought you into my life for a reason, Aimee, - Good morning, - Good morning, - Sleep well? Sweetheart, you okay? - Yeah, I just,,, I had a bad dream, - About what? - It was about Francine, - Hmmm, I hope it wasn't because of what I said, - I'm fine, I'm sure everything's all right, I'll give her a call today, - Okay, Well, I am heading to the office, I've got couple of counseling sessions and then lunch with the board, - I'll pray for you, - Yes, please, - Don't worry, - Call me if anything comes up, - I will, Take care, - Love you, - Love you too, Francine, Thank you for calling the Reese's, Leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as we can, - Hello? - Hi Flint, this is Aimee Anderson, I'm a friend of your mother's, - Ah, you're the Pastor's wife at my parents church, right? - Yes, that's right, Flint, I was trying to reach your mother over a meal she offered to provide for a widow, Have you heard from her? - Yeah, no, no, I wouldn't worry about it, No, they got working their yard, they don't hear the phone, Cell phone coverage out there is pretty much non-existent, Country life, right? - Well, if you do hear from her, can you ask her to give me a call? - You bet, - Thanks so much, Bye, bye, - Honey, Did I forget about a meeting? - No, I wanted to go out to Luke and Francine's place, - Sweetheart, we can't just show up like that, - I'm still having nightmares about them, No one, including their son, seems to know where they are, I'd really feel a lot better if we could go check, - Okay, let's go, - Debbie, we're going, - Okay, bye, - Wait here, - Okay, - Knocked on the door, Rang the bell, No answer, - I hope they're all right, - I'm sure they're fine, Just give her a call in the morning and if you aren't able to reach her, we'll come back tomorrow evening, okay? - Okay, - All right, - Oh, hi, Susan, Hi, Has Francine been to your place this week? - Oh, hi, Fay, how are you? Great, it's Aimee, I was wondering if you've heard from Francine today, You haven't either, huh? Oh, hi, George, I was just wondering if their boat was still docked, This might be a bit odd but I was wondering if the Reese's have come in to pick up their shipment this week? Veronica! Hi, You know, I was just calling to see if you've heard from Francine, You haven't, Yeah, you know I haven't heard from her for a while and I was starting to get a bit concerned, You're right, we'll just,,, Well you take care and God bless you, and we'll see you on Sunday, Great, Have a good day, Bye, bye, Thanks for doing this with me again, I don't think I could do it alone, - Oh, I wouldn't want you to, In all honesty, I'm starting to get a little concerned myself, So I scheduled a pastoral meeting in the same area tonight, - At the Renton's? - Mm-hmm, - Thank you, - Of course, sweetheart, - I was hoping we'd find them working in the yard, - I'll go check, - Wait, Something doesn't feel right, Can we pray? - Of course, Heavenly Father, you are our protector, you are our rock, our comforter, We'd like to lift Luke and Francine up to you right now, Lord, that wherever they are, whether they're at home or elsewhere that they are in the palm of your hand Lord, and that you are keeping them safe and protected, Thank you, Lord, Amen, - Amen, - I'll be right back, Hello? Luke? Francine? It's Albert, - Well? - Nothing, - Nothing? - The door was open a crack, but still,,, When I knocked on the door last night it was shut, - Are you sure? - Positive, - I think we should call the police, - No, hold on, Let's try Flint first, see if he knows what's going on, All right, let's get to the Renton's and we'll call him from there, - Pastor Anderson, Welcome, - Thank you, Mrs, Renton, - Can we use your phone? - Of course, It's in the kitchen, - Thank you, - But I thought you were here for the meeting, Hello? - Flint, This is Aimee Anderson calling, I was wondering if you found out where your parents are, No, I've been checking around, but-- - Well, have you been to their place or just phoned them? Yeah, just phoned, I really didn't think I needed to go out there, - Flint, my husband and I went to their home earlier this evening, Albert found the door open a crack and he called inside, but there was no answer, No, that's not like them, I'll head up there now, - Okay, we'll meet you there, - Is everything okay? - We're not sure, I'm sorry, do you mind if we reschedule? - Certainly, I hope it's nothing serious, - Yeah, so do we, - Thank you, - They're both here,,, but they're gone, - Here Sweetheart, - In the bedroom, - The police are on their way? - Police? - You didn't call them? - No, I,,, - We need to call the Sheriff right away, Where's the phone? - It's right here, I can't get a dial tone, - Tap it a few times, Anything? - Yeah, 9-1-1, - Hello? Do you have an emergency? - Hello, yeah, could you please come to the Reese residence on Maple Drive immediately? Sir, are you injured? - No, it's my parents, They've both been murdered, The Sheriff's Department is on their way, - Yes, yes, I understand, They'll be there shortly, - Please hurry, They said that we should wait outside and not to touch anything, - Okay, - Why don't you go wait in the car? - Will you come with me? I don't want to be alone, - You'll be safe, Just lock the door, I'll be right here, - Please, - All right, We'll be in the car, - Where is he going? - I don't know, He just looks like he's out for an afternoon stroll, - We all grieve in different ways, sweetheart, - This is so evil, - Jones! When did you guys get here? - We arrived shortly after Flint, the Reese's son, Have you been inside? - Yes, - All right, Go to the end of the driveway, okay? Wait there, I'm going to need to talk to ya, - Absolutely, - Aimee, - What? - The Sheriff asked you a question, - Sorry, Sheriff, Can we just go home? - Not yet, Did they invite many people in? - Yeah, a few, Here and there, but they didn't entertain much, - Hmmm, Did they keep cash stashed around the house? - No, - Oh, God, why is this happening? I really don't feel well, - I think I'm done with you Mrs, Anderson and Flint, Could you drive him home? - Of course, - Thank you, Honey, can you drive me home first? I really need to check on the kids, - Absolutely, - Thank you, - I'm good, I just don't get it, Nothing about these murders makes any sense, I just keep running it over again and again, Shirt's un-tucked, Top few buttons undone on his shirt, It's like something caught his attention before he could get fully dressed, - You know, that could just be the way he dressed around the house, - No, Reese was an impeccable dresser, He took pride in it, There's no marks around the windows or the doors, so no one was breaking in and caught him by surprise, They either they knew the killer or let a stranger in willingly, - Like somebody turned on them, - Maybe, Maybe, By all accounts, Mrs, Reese was an immaculate housekeeper, I mean there's nothing out of place, Everything neat and clean and in order, No signs of struggle, I just don't get it, Well, do these things ever make sense? - Poor thing, Tied up with a pair of her own panty-hose, You could consider it a murder suicide, I mean, they weren't getting along, hated retirement, he off's her and kills himself, - Suicide? - Doesn't fit though, Why would he untie her after he shoots her and then kill himself? No one shoots themselves, cleans up their own blood before they breathe their last, I don't care how ODC they might be, And where's the gun? - The ,22? - Everything's okay, I'll be back as soon as I can, You have nothing to fear, God is with you, I love you, Are you going to be all right? Flint? - Yeah, Thank you, I'll be fine, - We'll be praying for you, - Mom? What's wrong? Where's Dad? - Your Father's fine, He had to drive the Reeses' son home, - Why? What happened? - Something terrible, sweetheart, Come here, I'll tell you both, Tonight, your father and I found Mr, and Mrs, Reese dead in their home, Somebody shot them, - What? Who would do that? - We don't know, - But they loved us just like-- - They loved us like you and Dad love us, - I know, I'm so sorry, They were so good to us, - I know, Can we pray for Dad? - Of course, - Dear God, please bring Dad home safe, And help us so we will all be able to go to sleep, When we wake up, we won't have any worries, In Jesus name we pray, amen, - Amen, - Hey gang, - Dad! - Hey, You okay? Yeah? How's everybody doin'? You know I was driving back home, God put a verse on my heart, - Can you read it to us, Dad? - Of course I can, buddy, I'd love to, It's from Psalm 46, It's important that we remember it, especially in times like this, This is what it says, "God is our place of safety, "He gives us strength, "He's always there to help us in times of trouble, "The earth may fall apart, "The mountains may fall into the middle of the sea, "but we will not be afraid," That's beautiful, I don't know about you guys but I need a family hug, Come on, let's get in here Anderson family, Come on, Yeah, Your Mom and I love you guys so much, You are so precious to us, Mm-hmm, Thank you, Lord, - I don't think I'll ever be able to think of the Reese's home in the same way again, - I know, It's going to be difficult, but,,, - You can't un-see that sort of thing, Albert, It's etched in my heart, - I know, sweetheart, I know, We have to go on, We have the kids to think about, God will keep us, - But that's just it, Luke and Francine knew God just like we do, She taught Sunday school, She was the daughter of a minister, How could something so terrible-- - Sweetheart, we have to trust him, I know, I know it's hard to understand right now, We don't hold all the pieces and we probably never will, but Aimee, God is greater than all of this, He has the power to deliver us from any and all fear, Come here, - Albert? - Hmmm? - Will you go downstairs and make sure the kitchen windows are locked, and then check on the children again? Please? - Okay, - Thank you, - I need you, Lord, Please give me strength, Lord, Give me strength, I need it, I need your wisdom, I need the right words to say, Lord, to comfort my family, To comfort my wife, Lord, Please, God, please, - Albert! Albert! Albert, there's someone in the house! - What? Albert, I think there's someone in the house! Wake up! - Where? - There, did you here that noise? It's downstairs, - What? - It's in the hall now! Can you go check on it? - Yeah, - The children, hurry! - Okay, Okay, - Albert! - I'm going, sweetheart, okay, - Albert? Albert, - Sweetheart, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey, Hey, let go, let go, - I'm sorry, - Come on, - I thought it was someone else, - It's okay, - Are you okay? - I'm fine, I'm fine, everything's okay, - Are the kids okay? - The kids are fine, - But I know I heard something, - You did, You heard the floor creaking, I can see how that can sound like someone walking around, It's okay, - Oh, thank God it's you, - It's okay, Come on, let's get back to bed, Get in bed, - Sorry, - Don't be sorry, You okay? - No, I'm not, I just keep thinking about Luke and Francine, - Hmmm, - What they must have gone through, - I know, - Who is safe? - You want me to pray for us? - Okay, - Yeah? Come here, Heavenly Father, we plead the blood of Christ, Lord, over my wife, over our children, Lord, over our congregation, over our entire community, Lord, we need you, We say, Lord, to this entire situation, we say peace be still, That you still our hearts, Lord, that you bring peace to us, We thank you Lord for these things, We pray for it, Lord, in your mighty and powerful name, Amen, - Amen, Thank you, - Pastor, everyone's afraid, They haven't caught the killer yet, It could be someone in this room, - Yeah, Pastor, it's really changed the whole town, I mean, normally everyone's pretty easy going and laid back, We don't even lock our doors or windows at night, - Yeah, I know, - Lori has me keeping my shotgun next to the bed now, and she hates guns, - Yeah, Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you firsthand that things are, that things are challenging right now, For all of us, But we can't forget that God is still in control, - Yeah, but Pastor, how can God let the Reese's be cut down in cold blood? - I'm not saying I understand it, Mike, The reality is that we live in a sin drenched world, There really is an enemy out there that seeks to steal, kill, and destroy us, But if there's one thing I know is that God can take a situation even like this one and make good from it, Me? I choose to trust, I hope you gentlemen will do the same, You ready to go, sweetheart? Have a blessed afternoon, gentlemen, Thank you, Pastor, - That is a man of faith right there, Go, ahead, roll, roll, roll, - Thank you for making cookies, Mary, - We thought that it would be nice, - Smells great over there, ladies, I'll get it, Here, hold on buddy, I'll be right back, Nobody is going to roll until I get back, - We'll be right back, - Okay, - Pastor, - Flint, come in, Grace, - Can I get you some coffee or tea? The girls just made fresh cookies, - No thank you, - No, - Okay, - So, how are you two holding up? - Why did you two leave the funeral so quickly? - Well, it was very hard on us, as you can imagine, Your parents were becoming very close friends of ours, - Did you receive any money from them? - Money? No, of course not, - How much beef did they give you? - I'm sorry? - Dad told they gave you some, - Well-- - About half, - Half a beef? I don't understand, - You know how much money the Crane's got from our parents? - No, I mean, we know they loaned them some to help out, but we don't know how-- - Exactly, Everybody was taking advantage of them, of their goodness, and their generosity, And because of that they're dead, - Excuse me? - What I'm saying is because of my parents generous spirit, they're dead! Somebody in this town didn't get what they wanted and they got mad so they killed them, - Now hold on, Flint, You can't go around making accusations like that, - I don't know who did it yet but when I find out-- - Flint! I think we're done here, Let's go, - Oh, and if somebody borrowed somethin' from our parents, we want it back, Tell them that, Put that in one of your sermons! - Come on, Flint, - I mean it! - Sheriff Tomlin, - Sheriff, this is Jon Klaussen over on Willow Drive, I got to thinking about this deal with the Reese's, - Yeah? - I couldn't get it out of my mind, - What do you mean? I was driving to Port Angeles on 101, I think it was September 2nd or so, As I came across a rise in the road, just past Stevenson's tulip farm, I saw this woman hitch-hiking, At first, I wasn't gonna stop, but then I saw she had a baby, I felt sorry for her, so I gave her a ride, You need a ride somewhere? I don't really think a woman could pull off a murder like everyone's saying happened to the Reese's, but this gal didn't say much and she didn't seem to know where she was going, I kept trying to find out where, but it just made her more and more nervous, We drove through Sequim and headed toward Port Angeles, Suddenly she asked me to stop and let her out, It was right near the Dungeness River Bridge, I said to her, "Why let you off here?" And she says, "I'm going to sleep under the bridge tonight," I told her, "This was no place for a baby," She looked like she was giving it some thought, but then she got out and walked away, I didn't know how to convince her otherwise so I drove off, - That's just a few hundred yards from the Reese's place, - Yeah, I know, - Anything else you can tell me about the incident? - I'm afraid that's it, Sheriff, - All right, John, I appreciate it, Appreciate the call, If there's anything else you can recall about it, don't hesitate to get ahold of me, - Yeah, Of course, - Thanks, - Are you expecting someone? - No, Bade! You can't just come in here! Hey, we're here to protect you, - Protect us from what? - From the murderer, of course! I don't understand, - It's like the newspaper said, Preacher, it could have been anyone in town, You're an important man, Important enough to protect, - Are you,,, Are you sure about this, Bade? - Well, that's just it, you never can never really be sure, Do you have a metal detector? - No, we don't, - Did you ever consider that the murder weapon could buried right out there in your yard? - Well I,,, - You're the only decent man left in this town, They already killed Luke Reese, - Bade, I'm,,, I'm concerned, - Well, you should be concerned, We're gonna stay the night, Maybe a couple nights if we need to, - Bade, I don't think that's-- - That's great, Bade, Thank you, - Yeah, we want to make sure you're safe, - Well, we appreciate that, We're gonna head up to bed now, Have a good night, - Let's settle in, - Debbie, Sweetheart, What's wrong? - Is this what it's gonna be like from now on? What do you mean? - I'm scared, Mom, Sometimes I'll stay up at night wondering if you and Dad are gonna make it home, Wondering if I'm going to have to become the parent, What would make you think such a thing? - I don't know, - It's going to be okay, I promise, - Is everything okay up there, Mrs, Anderson? - We're fine up here, Bade, - Just checking, - It's going to be all right, okay? Come here, - Good night, - Just so you know, I'm not okay with this, - Well, I'm not okay with it either, - Then why did you let them stay? - Well, I thought it would be worse if I asked them to leave, Like telling them that I didn't trust them, - Are you telling me you trust two men with loaded guns and conspiracy theories to camp out in our living room? - No, sweetheart, What I'm saying is that if I asked them to leave they may have taken it the wrong way, - What are we going to do? - About Bade? - About everything, I jump at every sound I hear, And I have you chasing every little noise throughout the night, The whole town is terrified, Poor Debbie thinks we could be killed next, - And so does Bade, apparently, - How can you make jokes right now? - I'm sorry, But I'm, I'm sorry, you're right, What? - You don't think Bade has something to do with this do you? - I can't say that I haven't wondered about a few people but-- - But what? - But we can't go jumping to conclusions out of fear, And I'm not just talking about you and the kids, You know, it's like you said, this whole town is paralyzed, - You're right, I feel like I should have so much more faith than this, - Oh, no, no, Don't go doing that to yourself, okay? - I wish this never happened, - I know, I'll tell you what, I'll ask them to leave at first-light and let them know that we appreciate it, but that we've got it covered from here on out, Hmmm? I'll even put in a few extra locks for good measure, Okay? - Okay, I just wish they would leave now, - I know, They'll be gone soon enough, Come on, let's try and get some sleep, - Okay, - I love you, - I love you too, - I'm right here, Bade? - Why'd you do it? - Do what? - Call the Sheriff! All we were doing is trying to help ya', trying to protect ya', - We did no such thing, Bade, - Well why'd the Sheriff come around then asking all kinds of questions about the Reese's? - Well, I don't know, I mean they're talking to everyone, - But it seemed to happen just after we come over to protect you that night, You expect me to believe that's just a conscience? - No, - Then you did it, - What, no, look, all I'm saying is that they're talking to everyone, Bade, - I warned you, - Warned me about what? - I warned you that you might regret getting to know us, Well, that time has come, - What are you going to do, Bade? - I'm, gonna tell your supervisor, that's what, Wait till he hears how you've been treating your flock! - Well, you have every right to do that, Bade, But know this-- - But what? - I'm going to keep praying for you, and your family, - Francine Reese was not the kind of woman to turn away a woman with a baby, I'm thinking this deranged woman got up, went to the Reese house for some food or a hand-out, And if she had a gun she could have ordered Francine into submission and bound her, And if you really think about it, this is just the size of pistol a woman would carry, - What about Mr, Reese? How would he fit into this scenario? - His son told me that Luke liked to go out on the family properties in the morning to work all day long, He'd come back midday for lunch, So, maybe she surprised him when he came to the door to change his clothes, And if you really think about it, a psychotic woman might be more likely to untie the bonds after shooting Mrs, Reese and might be more likely to clean up the blood, Put out an APB on every detail we have, Maybe someone will remember this hitch-hiking baby woman, - You got it, - All right, I understand, but as soon as you find out about that call me back, thanks, - She's clean, - What? - She admits to being in the area and even sleeping under the bridge, but she didn't murder anybody, She was up at dawn, on the road and seen a hundred miles away from there, She might be mentally challenged but completely harmless, We're back to square one! - Undersheriff Jannsen? - Now is not a good time, - Well, I thought you should know my dad's ,357 is missing, - Flint! I'm sorry, what did you say? - Well, my sister was doing inventory up at my parents place and my dad's ,357 is missing, He always kept it in a shelf in the closet, Here, Here's the make and serial number, - Your parents were killed with a ,22 though, - Yeah, I know, it doesn't make any sense, but still, I thought you should know, - Thanks, Flint, Here's what we're going to do, We're going to run the gun as stolen if you're okay with that, - Yeah, - Get me a signed stolen report for that, And call the FBI, I want to know if anyone has ran that gun, Oh, and get ahold of the ATF and have them run the gun through E-Trace, Maybe someone pawned or sold the gun for some extra cash, Okay, let's get this case moving again! - Fill this out here, - Well, I'm assuming this isn't a social visit, Do you have more questions for us? - How well do you know Bade Blake? - Well, he's a, he's a member of the congregation, You might think this is ridiculous, but I, I let him and his grandson stand guard a few nights back, - You did? How? - With their shotguns, - Right here, in fact, - Why? - Well, to be honest I felt that it was safer to let them stay than insist that they leave, - Hmmm, - Bade isn't a suspect is he, Sheriff? - No, He's not, But I wouldn't recommend him guarding your home anymore though, - Why? - He's a diagnosed schizophrenic with a record, - Really? Well, we've had a falling out since, so, - Is he harassing you? - No, No, no, nothing like that, Sheriff, He's all bark, He's got a good heart, - I'll keep an extra patrol in your neighborhood just in case though, - Thank you, - Mm-hmm, yeah, we appreciate that, - You know, we're still questioning a lot of people, Friends of the Reese's, We know that Mrs, Reese counseled a lot of people within the church, so we-- Everyone is still a suspect, - Whoever it was, it wasn't just a double murder, It was a double execution, Someone with a seared conscience, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you, Thank you for the coffee, ma'am, Thank you for coming by, Sheriff, - Absolutely, Sheriff? - Yes, Mrs, Anderson? - Never mind, it's probably nothing, - Well, hold on a second, In a case like this, nothing could be something, What is it? Well,,, Have you been by the Crane residence yet? - No, I haven't, Why? - Well, right around the time of the murders, Faye called Francine, All Francine said was, "I can't talk right now, "I've got to go and be with my Lord," - Faye Crane, What else? - You don't think that has anything to do with it do you? - It might, Anything else? - After Faye's friend Caroline passed away, Faye had a vision that two more people would die, She was so upset she didn't even go to the funeral, Remember? I do, Sweetheart, - Okay, Is that it? That's all I can think of for now, but we'll call you if there's anything else, - Very good, Thank you, - We'll see you out, - Okay, Listen, a friend of mine goes to your church, I can see if he can't loan you a gun or two, You can never be too careful, - Well, I don't know how comfortable I feel about that, but given the circumstances, thank you, - You're welcome, - Have a good day, What do you say we grab the kids, pile them into the van, go for a drive and get some fresh air? - Okay, - Not too far now, I love this place, - I still can't believe the Sheriff isn't any closer to solving this than he was two weeks ago, - Well, these things take time, sweetheart, - I just feel like if they could find out who did this I could be myself again, I wouldn't have to be afraid any more, - But that's not how God works, That wouldn't be faith at all, - What do you mean? - Well, we live in fear because of the unknown, So we fill in the blanks and we "fear" the worst, - Our friends are murdered, How can we not be afraid? You heard the sheriff, these were executions, Whoever did this can do this again, - I know, I know, sweetheart, but God asks us to trust him, to deliver us in the middle of the fear, in the middle of the unknown, Think about Daniel when he was in the lion's den, He faced some very real furry and sharp fanged fears, But he prayed and he trusted while he was surrounded by his fear, And he came out all the better for it, Look, we found a fuzzy caterpillar, - A caterpillar? Well, I want to see that, - What are you doing here, Sheriff? Did you come to harass me again? - Bade, we need to talk, - So talk, - I need you to leave the Andersons alone, Don't go near their home, Don't call 'em, Just stay away, got it? - Yeah, I got it, Oh, I understand perfectly, I'm sorry, Sheriff, I don't know why I did that, Sheriff, I'm sorry, Really, Sheriff, I'm sorry, I apologize, forgive me, - Turn around, It's okay, man, We're gonna get you some help, buddy, Okay? I'm sorry, Sheriff, - It's all right, let's go, Albert, we're all in agreement, You need to do more, - Well, what do you propose I do, gentlemen? I've given sermons, We've had prayer meetings, We've denounced the enemy, When it comes right down to it, it's about people and their choices, Now I can lead them to the water, but it's up to them to drink it, - Well-- - And the Sheriff is doing everything that he can to solve this, Now, I'm sorry but I really don't know what more I can do, - I'm so sorry to interrupt, gentlemen, I have Sheriff Tomlin on the line asking for you, Pastor, - You mind taking a message? - I tried, but he says it's urgent, - Okay, I'll take it, - Thank you, he's on line two, - Excuse me, gentlemen, Sheriff, how can I help you? I'm at the Crane residence, Can you and your wife come and drive Faye Crane to the psychiatric hospital? She's having a breakdown and says she won't go without your wife, I understand, As soon as you can get here, - Of course, We'll be right there, Thank you, - Albert, what was that about? - Aimee and I have to drive one of our church members to the psychiatric hospital for evaluation, - Now that's exactly what we're talking about, This is getting out of hand, One of our congregants is being committed to a mental institution? - If you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Hey, gang, Everybody have a good day? - Yeah, - I thought you had a board meeting, - I did, something's come up, You wanna grab a sweater, I'll explain on the way? - Okay, Becky, can you say grace? Yeah, - Debbie, you mind taking over for your mom? - Sure, don't worry about us, Love you, Dad, - Love you guys, - Bye, Mom, love you, - I should have seen this coming, - What do you mean? - After Sheriff Tomlin's visit she called me, She said she thought her husband was the murderer, - That doesn't make any sense, - I know, I assumed it was her exhaustion talking, She asked me to pray for her and I did, I thought she'd be okay after that, - Well, we'll do whatever we can for them, - I can't believe it's come to this, - Aimee! Don't let them take, don't take me to the hospital! Not in the back of that car like a criminal! Not get in the back of that car! Don't you touch me! - Aimee, bring her here, - Don't you touch me! Don't you trust him! Don't you trust him! Don't trust him! I know everything about it! I know everything about it! - You all right, Rob? - It's been tough, Yeah, I can imagine, - We'll be right behind you, Hit your flashers if you need any help, Okay? We'll meet you there, - I know who committed the murderers, I know who did it, - I know, Faye, you already told me, - No, no, no, no, no! The Psychiatrist! And my husband's in on it, Aimee, Faye, the doctor's here, - Do not touch me, do not touch me, - Mrs, Crane, I'm Doctor Barrett, I'm going to ask you some questions, How long did it take you to get here? How long do you think you'll be here? - I know what you did, And I know what you did, And I know what you did, and you did, and you did, and you did, - Mrs, Crane, are you going to cooperate peacefully or do I need to get some help in here? - Oh, you know what? You're just a horrible, horrible little man! Horrible people, don't shake your head at me! "She's a dim wit, little num, num, little stupid head," You know what?! I know! Okay?! You think you're soooo smart like you pulled one over on me, but I know, No, I know! You're not gonna get away with this! Don't you touch me! You're not going to get away with this either, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, don't, Don't, Don't, Don't, Please, No, No, No, No, Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! I know you know the truth! I know you know the truth! I know you see it too, you feel it! The truth will set her free! The truth will set her free! Don't touch me! - Do you think I could end up like Faye? I can't shake these fears, - Sweetheart, sometimes God gives us more than we can handle, More than we can handle on our own, It's why He created us for relationship with Him, - But I know Him, and I know I need Him, and I talk to Him, but I just feel so trapped, - Aimee, are you letting the Lord carry this? Or are you still trying to carry it on your own? - I don't know, - Come here, It's okay, It's okay, Why don't you head home, take a nice hot bath, try and relax, I'll probably be here all night with Rob, I'll get the Sheriff to give me a ride home, - Okay, - Okay, - Just give me a minute, - Of course, Of course, I love you, - I love you too, I'm giving this all to you Jesus, Take it, - Mom, you're humming, - I am? I am! Debbie! It's such a great day! What's going on? - Isn't it a great day, Debbie? - What is going on? What did I miss? - We're dancing for joy, Daddy! - You are?! Well, I want to dance for joy too! Come on! I love you guys, come here, Arrrrr, I love seeing you like this, - You're home just in time to make breakfast, Oh, perfect, yeah, - Sheriff Tomlin, - Sheriff, this is Detective Reid over in Bellingham, We've got your gun, - What?! I'm sorry, did I hear you correctly? - We picked it up off a perp last night, I ran the serial through the NCIC and got a hit, - Who is he? - Edward Chaney, Best we can tell he's new in town, He's working as a tree planter in Bothel, So, last night he borrows his boss' vehicle and ends up in Bellingham after picking up a couple of hitch-hikers, Now all of them have a little bit too much to drink, Chaney runs the car off the road, One of our officers witnessed the whole thing, Well the hitch-hikers are laughing and Chaney takes off like a fox, Officer Tillman is in pursuit and we loose him just outside of a nature park, So, we call in the dogs when we finally do catch up with him he's got the ,357 in his possession, - Mm-hmm, He says he picked it at a junk yard for ten bucks but can't for the life of him remember where, - Of course he doesn't, - Oh, and you should also know that there's a hold on him from New York State, parole violation, - I need to talk to him, - Yeah, sure, have at it, - Okay, thanks, We'll be there first thing tomorrow morning, Okay, see you then, - All right, thanks, - Well, this is good, - I sure hope so, Mr, Chaney, Sheriff Tomlin, Clallam County, There's this little matter of a ,357 found in your possession, It was taken from the scene of a double homicide we're investigating, - Okay, I don't know nothing about no murder, Like I told all the others, I bought the gun second hand-- - Yeah, that's right, From a junk yard, ten bucks, Which one? Oh, you know,,, I just,,, I can't remember, - Have you ever been in Sequim, Mr, Chaney? - Look, I came out here for work, right? Fresh start 'n all, - And violate the terms of your parole, - No, no, no, okay, When you get out of prison, they want you to re-integrate, Best way to do that is to move someplace new and start fresh, - I see, Can you tell me where you were on the 2nd of September? - Ain't nobody remembers that, - You're a felon in violation of parole, cited for drunk driving, property damage, resisting arrest and in possession of a firearm that disappeared in a robbery that left two people brutally murdered, I'm having a heck of a time believing you came out west here to turn over a new leaf, In fact, I bet a Grand Jury would have a hard time believing that as well, Mr, Chaney, - You can't prove nothin' and I have a one way ticket back to New York tomorrow, so,,, Oh, you're gonna stay here? - Is this your guy? - I think so, - Brady, - I'm afraid your trip was unnecessary, I have here, in my hand, a warrant for Chaney from the Clallam County Prosecutor's office, He's a material witness in a couple of murders cases and that supersedes your extradition order, thanks, He's all yours, - Looks like you got yourself an extended stay, It's good though, It gave you a few extra days to think things over, I wonder,,, how many of those good people are gonna have recollections of you in their fine town after we flash your photo around, And I wonder just how forgiving they'll be sat down as a panel of your peers, There must be a very special place reserved in Hell for someone like that, - I didn't murder those people, One of my friends that I served time with back in New York moved out here a couple months ago, We planned a camping trip, The plan was to break into people's trailers when they was down at the beach, We started down on the Oregon coast and moved our way north, Didn't have much luck though, We ended up somewhere up here before we crossed the sound and went home, - Is that it? I said, is that it? No more details, - If you want more details, I want a deal, Now I didn't murder those people but I know who did, - Deal? I don't make deals with convicts, I have enough on you to put you away for life, You'd be better off just telling me the rest, - You know what? You're right, You don't make deals, The District Attorney on the other hand, they make deals, And I'd wonder how they'd feel about this conversation, - Are you sure you guys are okay with this? I just thought you might want to be here and listen to this yourselves, - Thank you, Sheriff, Yeah, we appreciate it, - All right, - Got a pen? I knew that my old cell-mate, Brian Sanders, and his wife were planning on moving out here once he got out, He told me I should hit him up when I got out, So that's what I did, We had a couple of days off in early September and we decided we'd just go have some fun, We were going to rob campers, You know, people who could actually afford to be on vacation, but we just, we had no luck, Apparently, you guys camp different out here than we do back east, So, the next day, we were in Port Angeles area and we just started looking for houses, We figured most people were gonna be gone for Labor Day weekend, So, we find these houses at the back end of this dead-end road pretty far out, It didn't look like anyone else was around, Brian tells me, stay in the car, He grabs his ,22, gets out, and goes up to this house to check it out, So, he knocks on the door and this old lady comes out and he just shoves her right through the doorway, I didn't know what to do, Suddenly, I hear a couple of shots go off so I got out of the car and I ran into the house, Are you okay?!? - I don't want to hear it! - Wanna here what?! What is going on?! - Dude, I was tying her up, I was gagging her, This guy, right here, walks up-- - And you shot someone?! - I had to shoot him! - What?! Why did you have to shoot him?! We need to go! Come on, let's go! - No! No! No! We need to get her in the room, now, - Why do we need to? - We need to, let's go, get up! - You know this is a horrible idea, right? No, don't, don't, don't! - Yes! There you go buddy, Now you have one, Let's go, - And we take off, Head back across the sound and home, like nothing had ever happened, - So, is that it? - Enough to go to trial, We'll see if his story holds up, - And there's still so many unanswered questions, - Welcome to my world, - Thank you, Sheriff Tomlin, * When peace like a river * Attendeth my way * When sorrows * Like sea billows roll * Whatever my lot * Thou hast taught me to say * It is well * It is well * With my soul * It is well * With my soul * It is well * It is well with my soul * Though Satan should buffet * Though trials should come * Let this blessed assurance control * * That Christ has regarded * My helpless estate * And hath shed * His own blood * For my soul * It is well * With my soul * It is well, it is well * With my soul * My sin * Oh, the bliss * Of this glorious thought * My sin * Not in part * But the whole * Is nailed to the cross * And I bear it no more * Praise the Lord * Praise the Lord * O, my soul * It is well * With my soul * It is well, it is well * With my soul * And Lord face the day * When thy faith shall beside * The clouds may roll back * As a storm * The drum shall resound * And the Lord shall descend * Even so * It is well * With my soul * It is well * With my soul * It is well, it is well * With my soul
