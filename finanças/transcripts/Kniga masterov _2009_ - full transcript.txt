And she had a daughter - a girl who was pretty and kind. Not at all like her mother. Only a misfortune befell the girl. Once she found in the forest the Alatyr Stone, a stone of fantastic beauty and magic untold. The Stone cast a spell on the girl, and she became the Stone Princess. starring MARIA ANDREEVA MAKSIM LOKTIONOV She was destined to remain locked up in the Stone Tower till the day when a Great Master brings to life the Alatyr Stone. LIA AHEDJAKOVA LEONID KURAVLEV ARTUR SMOLYANINOV IRINA APEKSIMOVA For 300 years the Princess was imprisoned inside the Stone Tower. She became angry at the entire world, her heart turned to stone. Across the entire world her Ardar warriors roamed spreading evil and wreaking havoc. Meanwhile the Stone Princess languished inside the Tower and throughout centuries searched for the Great Master." Do the strongest of warriors serve me? Certainly, Stone Princess. Do the stones obey me? Without a doubt, Stone Princess. Am I the ruler of all dark forces? Yes. Then answer me: how long am I to languish in this tower? Where's the new Master? There's a bit of a problem here. He kind of exists and kind of doesn't. Enough with riddles! - Where's the new Master?! - Please don't get agitated. If you get agitated - then I get agitated. What prophesy, I beg you! Where is he?! Well, there is some prophesy-hypocrisy? But who cares about all those old-wives tales! That's it. I'm tired of this. Answer me now! No! No! Wait, Stone Princess! You are such a hot-tempered woman, heavens be with you. Out with it! Once upon a time, in a far away land? Out with it! There is such a Master, Stone Princess. Only his time has not yet come. There is?! Show him to me! I'm extremely sorry, but your time is up. Till our next transmission? a film of VADIM SOKOLOVSKY BOOK OF MASTERS Hey, Kuzma! What do you want? Vanya! Have you been sitting here all night? Leave me, Kuzma! Just a little bit left. Ivan! You've lost your mind! Run quickly! Everyone is with Barin (lord of the manour)! With Barin?! What time is it?! You're late! On this celebratory day I would also like to note that the stone-cutters workshop I oversee has exceeded? Enough! Get to the point! The portrait of our esteemed birthday girl is made of precious stone of the highest quality. And since the previous birthday of our dear birthday girl was only yesterday, we did not expect, the next one to come so soon. Well? So this work has been completed in record time by myself personally? - Well?! - Well?! Personally?! Where the devil have you been? And on this celebratory day I am very happy to give the gift to our dear birthday girl Klavdia. - How dare you! - It wasn't me! Honestly! - A whipping! - It wasn't me! Brothers! It wasn't me! Honestly! Not me! Not me! It's all Vanya! Him?! Grab him! Don't touch him! He'll come on his own. You wish! You'll come, you'll come? Or I'll do to your little toy? Your father was such a talented man. Don't! Give it back! That is all I have left of my father? Let me go! I'll come myself! Well, start! Ardars? Ardars! Daddy! - Save Barin! - Klavdia! Daddy! - Where are you, Klavdia?! - Klava! My dad is the Barin! Hey, freaks! Let her go! And so the Ardars took Ivan and Klava to the Neverending Forest to Baba-Yaga herself as a gift! You've brought your hoard once again, Yangul the warrior? You should know, I don't have any food. We haven't come empty-handed. So why are you standing there, counting crows? Bring them into the hut! What have you brought for me? What's this? This is just skin and bones! Well this one's alright! This one has some fat on her. My dad is the Barin. He'll whip you all! Is he fat too? Ivan, tell her! - He's fat. - Idiot! A fat idiot - that's delicious! Why are you standing? Wait outside! You hungry stonemen? I'll treat you to some soup from death-cap mushrooms. Quiet! You want to run away? Who are you?! Me? I'm the daughter of the Stone Princess! What Stone Princess? You what?! You don't know who is the Stone Princess? Don't know and don't want to know. My dad is the Barin. He'll send his men here. They'll save me and will whip you all! I'll whip you! Whip you all! Oh, what grief! Oh, what misfortune! Find my daughter! Alive and unharmed! Oh, what grief! Oh, what misfortune! So long as? these Ardars? continue with the unlawful raids? on our peaceful leands and villages? I mean lands. Lands and villages. Or? leands? No matter! There'll be a whipping! Oh, Barin, what grief this is! What are we to do? What are? So! The kidnappers must be destroyed! Bring my daughter back! Go, my eagles! Go after the Ardars! Where do we go? What? Where do we find these Ardars? Oh, you imbeciles! You don't know where Ardars live! Well, usually they come to us themselves! There are rumors that Ardars live in the Neverending Forest? You see, any fool knows: Ardars live in the Neverending Forest? But the Neverending Forest is just that: it's neverending! We don't go there. It, you know, doesn't have an end. No. We don't go there. - Never. - No-no. Neither our grandfathers nor our fathers ever went there. Barin, you are sending them to their death. A human being cannot defeat an Ardar! - Dare cross me! A whipping's coming! - They are bewitched people! They say, it's been a thousand years since Stone Princess cast a spell on them. And we will obey the Stone Princess, untill the day when a stone starts crying, and a human being feels pity for the stone. Their chief warrior - Yangul. Instead of a heart he has stone and? scissors instead of hands. Old wives tales! Ignorance and superstition! So. I'll whip anyone who disobeys me! Well?! Oh, mercy! Oh, Lord! Ignorant masses. I have to enlighten them and enlighten some more. Only the patient teachings of a father are capable of? Yes! Yes! Get out. Out! Wanted to run away? Go on, run! Nothing will come of it. Go ahead! Making fun of us are you? Is that fair? Fair? What does it mean "fair"? Without your magic sorcery! Can't do it fairly?! Fairly? Without sorcery? How is that? Lower the fence and then try to catch us yourself! That will be fair! Sure! Let's do it this way! Run, Klava! Run! - And you? - Run! Vanya. Run! It's? It's a? At the bottom she has? a snake tail! - Really?! - Yeah. I won't lie. There's a sting in her mouth. And her eyes are of stone? And her hair is stone, and her arms are stone, and her legs are stone. And? - But you said she has a tail? - Don't confuse me! I told you, Stone Princess! I won't lie. So, the Stone Princess is searching the world, searching for a master stone craftsmen. We had this one Stepan. He was so skilled - he could carve any stone in any way. So the Stone Princess lured him into the Neverending Forest, and that was the end of him. He disappeared. His wife loved him a lot. She waited and waited, then fell ill and died. Their boy, Ivan (Vanya), became an orphan. Yeah? That's how it is. And you laugh. Maybe? We should stop have a bite first? He's so thin. Just skin and bones! What soup can you make out of that? Where you going? If he floats to the top, push him back down. - Should add some mushrooms? - Katya! I'll go see him out. We're tired of you, Yangul? - Look what the cat dragged in. What do you want? - I want to see her. Why are you pushing me?! Am I your latest amusement toy? - Aren't you tired of it, witch? - Am I the witch now? I am a witch, but I want to help you! Like I'll believe you! Granddaughter! Yes, Grandma? There's a guest to see you. Coming! Just let me stir the soup! She's stirring the soup! Get in! Where did you get this? Get in! - I want to see her. - There she's coming! So, stay here! Once I knock, then you come out and jump out the window. - Katya! Are you coming or not? - And? Yes coming, coming! It's? Better for us to not go back. He'll give us a whipping. Oh, that's because he doesn't respect us. - And the Ardars don't respect us! - O! Hush! Men! Men, look! A wild pig! And so we thought that it was a wild pig. We thought we'll catch it and? ?take it to our Barin. Then we looked closer? Oh, dear, dear, how could we mistake? Our esteemed... for a wild pig? Eagle! Eagle! Your operation for saving my daughter has been a success, so you deserve a reward! The most precious thing that I have is my daughter? She'll be yours. - What do you mean "be mine"? - Klavushka. Klavdyusha! Do you want to marry your savior? I do... want to marry Ivan. The soup came out so bland, there's virtually nothing in it. No meat at all. I have to go sleep on an empty stomach. Give the bones to the Grey Wolf. Alright, Grandma. Hey! Fear the boy! What? I need to fear some boy?! A-ha-ha-ha! You've got a head injury. Look at the crack in the mirror. Fear the boy! Cut it out! I don't fear anyone. And I say you should fear. I just don't get it. I don't warn you - you don't like it, I do warn you - you don't like it. I'm a thousand years old. I can't work in these conditions. My nerves are on edge. Will you ever shut up?! Jump! - Or are you scared? - Who?! Me?! - Where are we? - Inside the Stone Tower. Ivan! Ivan, don't. He's alive. Yeah right, alive. Solid stone. Back in place. Let's go. Statue! Ardars are the army of the Stone Princess. The Stone Princess is my mom. Only, I rarely see her. She's usually very busy. Give me your hand. You won't make it on your own here. Your hand it's warm, alive? Well that's because I am... alive. Do all humans have hands like that? You didn't know that? Let's go. We have little time. There is one prophesy. Only the Great Master will be able to bring to life the Alatyr Stone. And when that stone comes to life, the Stone Princess will be able to leave the Tower and will gain power over the entire living world, not only stones. My mom is really hung up on this subject. Now every 100 years she kidnaps a master of stone carving, forces him to work, to chip away at Alatyr piece by piece and carve all sorts of trinkets, to make them come alive. But nothing works. Help me. Where did you get this from? When I was very little, my mom kidnapped one master. He was so kind. He had hands just like yours. Just as warm. Father? Where is he? Where is my father? He is no more. - She? The Stone Princess? - Yes. If only I could get my hands on her? Are you sure that's what you want? More than anything else in the world! Alright. This is the Book of Great Stone Artisans. Several generations of masters have been writing it. The last one was your father. Read it till the end, and you will become the Great Master. Then the Stone Princess will find you herself. But her power is great. Be careful that you don't spend the rest of your life here. So think about it, Ivanushka. Though, what is destined to happen cannot be avoided. That's all. Time for us to get out of here. Jump into the well and you'll be home in no time. Any well is an enterance into the magic world. So, you can really jump into any well? You can. Only it will not open up to everyone. Well? Time for you to go! Go on! Katya? Will I ever see you again?! What is destined to happen cannot be avoided. Go ahead, jump! Goodbye, Katya. I'll be waiting for you, Ivanushka. "And so Ivan began to study the Book of Great Stone Artisans. Countless secrets were stored in that book. For a whole year Ivan studied the book and carved miraculous objects out of stone. He forgot about the world outside, stoped keeping track of time. He ate rarely. Only one thought consumed his mind: 'I will become a Great Master of stone carving, such as the world has never seen.' Pride gripped hold of Ivanushka." Where have you ever seen that a dead stone would come to life? You're a good friend, Kuzma, only foolish. Do you have a dream? Ha? A dream! Something you desire more than anything else. - More than anything? - Yes. I do have. A pineapple! What?! I've seen it in a book. There exists such a fruit called "pineapple." And I realized: I can't die, untill I try this fruit. I just really want a pineapple! That's it? Alright, only you won't tell anyone? Promise? Vanya, I am really in love with Klava? I want it, I want it, I want it! I want to get married! To Ivan! Again? We're having a holiday. The lady ordered us to bake a wedding cake. - A holiday?! - Yes. My daughter wants to marry a peasant. - Is that the holiday we're having?! - Yes, yes. If she wants to marry a peasant, then let her marry a peasant! - Bring Ivan here quickly! - Yes, Sir. - Why have you come? - As if you don't know? You've cut off all ties with society. Sitting here, doing who knows what. Maybe you're up to something no good, hey? At a time when our workshop? is working hard to exceed the assigned plan by 12%, you are? Wow! Where did you steal such a mouse from? - Steal?! That's my work! - You're lying! You couldn't possibly carve such a mouse! No one can! I can! - How dare you speak to me this way? - He's here! Come here! There you go! Katya. Hello, Mirror. Katya! What do you want? Now you are a big girl, so I can tell you the truth. You're not the daughter of that witch. The Stone Princess kidnapped you in order to raise an assistant for herself. But you are a human being, and you have a kind heart. Trust me. So what should I do? Congratulations. I am giving you my daughter in marriage. I know, I know, you're happy. But that's not all. Along with my daughter you will receive a dowry. I know, you're grateful. So, along with my daughter I give you: a three bedroom hut, stone foundation, next to a forest, so plenty of fresh air. There's been a road put through nearby. So people have called it "Rublevka." ["Rublevka" is Moscow's version of Beverly Hills.] Great place. I've been thinking of moving there myself. Next: a cart - made in Germany, steam engine. Drives so nicely! Ah! It even has a bell. Jingle, jingle! Jingle, jingle! Delightful! Alright, alright, I'll give you money? A bag of silver. Oh, Vanya! So difficult, the bloodsucker! So be it, a bag of gold! What else? I love another. We have to get married. You will be mine. - That is what the Stone Princess has ordered. - Ordered to marry? Yangul! And what if she orders you to drown yourself? You'll what? Go and drown? Yes. - What about jumping off the tower? - Yes. - What if I order it? - Yes. You will do what I order? I will do what you ask. Marry me. No. No, I? I love another. There, there, stay quiet! In the morning I'll come for you. Barin said, if you don't go into marriage of your own free will, we'll drag you by force! What is destined to happen cannot be avoided. Stone Princess! Silent for so long and then all of a sudden you speak? - What's going on? - I must tell you... in accordance with the magical spell paragraph 78, part 2. The Great Master? has appeared. Where is he? I have read the book to the very end! Do you hear me, Stone Princess?! I'm the Master! The well has let me through. It must be that I am the Great Master! Master? Just like father? Welcome to the tower, Master! The Ardars will see you in! Klava! Klava! Klava! Who's there? Be gone! Now daddy? Wait! You know,? I really? like you a lot. You have beautiful eyes. Your nose is so cute. Your cheeks are so plump. You're just like a pastry pie. You must have a good appetite! Thank you for the kind words, invisible spirit! Are you an angel from above? Angel? Angel? - Vanya! - Katya! Vanechka! Katya! I am now? I know, Ivanushka. I know everything. You've read the book to the end. Must be true that what's destined to happen cannot be avoided. I'm the Master! There is no one better than me now! You don't need it! So that's what you're like, Alatyr Stone! - Ivan! Let's get out of here! - Going far? Oh, how you are! Just like me. Just like you? I wonder why would that be? When you're not my mother! Mirror must have given it away! No matter. I don't have time for it right now. Ivanushka, don't be scared! You're a man! Why are you hiding behind a girl's skirt? I'm not hiding. - What do you want? - Answer me. - Do you love Katerina? - I love her! More than my own life! Don't exaggerate. Just "I love" will quite suffice. As Katya's guardian I have nothing against it. Go ahead and get married, if you wish. - So you're letting us go? - Yes! But! On one condition! I won't let Katya marry just anyone. Prove that you are a real Master. Bring to life Alatyr. Don't agree to it, Ivan! She will deceive you, and you will destroy the whole world! Katya! Katya! Why are you being so? If he brings Alatyr to life, I'll be so busy that I won't have time to get in your way! And if he can't bring it to life? Then what's the value in him? Simply a waste. I agree! And I will? break it! - No! - No! Alright. Have it your way. But know this, Ivan, if you don't bring Alatyr to life, then you'll never see your Katerina. Ivan! Yangul! Yangul! Defend yourself. I'm a warrior, not a murderer. She's mine! Vanya! No! No! I ask you, Yangul! Please! Don't kill him! I had promised to fullfill your request. Will you come with me? Ivan! Dear? You were supposed to bring them here! Do you hear? Here! Why did you not do it? I do not need a slave. I need a wife. Idiot! What does the girl have to do with it? I need him! The Master! He can bring Alatyr to life. Do you know, brainless Yangul, what's gonna happen then?! Grass will wither and die, rivers will dry up! The Earth will become stone and cold! And there will be night, neverending night! And I will rule across the Earth! - Let's go. - Wait. Ivan, give me the Alatyr. You don't need it. It will bring tragedy. I don't care about tragedy. If I bring Alatyr to life, then you and I will be together. And everyone will know that there is no greater stone master on Earth than me. You didn't want to do it the nice way, Katya, so we'll have to do it the evil way. Bring the stone to life, Master, and Katya will be yours! "And so Ivan began to work. To bring the Alatyr Stone to life. He didn't listen to Katya. And he didn't notice that the more alive Alatyr became, the more dark it became outside. The greater power of the Stone Princess over the world became." Katya, it's me! I have come for you! - Too late, Master. - Katya, what's with you? Well, you have brought Alatyr to life, Master. Now I will remain a witch forever. And the Stone Princess will take away your life. You shouldn't have believed her. Goodbye forever, Ivanushka. Kuzma! Listen, I'm asking you like a friend! Make me a sword that can cut through stone! I can. In how many days? In 5 minutes. Right away. Bring me the Alatyr! Kill Ivan! Only I'm not sure, if it can cut through stone. We'll check that right now. Run, Ivan, I'll hold them off! No-o-o! No-o-o! Go! Do I have to say the magic word? Please? "Ivanushka completely lost his head, when he realized that Ardars have taken the stone. He rushed to the well thinking: 'I'll defeat the Stone Princess, destroy the stone. I'll free Katya from the spell.'" The well didn't let me go through. It's alright. We'll go a different way! It's alive! The Alatyr! Why am I not feeling anything? Can it be that it's all in vain? So that's what it is. Go straight! Into the the Neverending Forest! Go! Please. For God's sake, that is your forest! You're a magic horse afterall! You're a horse yourself! You're a village native, and you can't tell the difference between a stallion and a horse! You're not "Ivan the Fool" by any chance? - Why are you calling me names? - Just wanted to make sure. Because if you were "Ivan the fool" that would be a completely different fairy tale. Got it. And I'm not "the fool." That's clear now. Why are you going into the forest? The well didn't let me pass through. And you thought it was some thoroughfare? The well had let you pass through, only while the Stone Princess allowed it. She doesn't need you anymore. That's why I need to go in the forest: to find Baba-Yaga and through her rescue Katya. Maybe you are "the fool" after all? You better admit it: you're going to die in that forest! So be it! There's no life for me without Katya anyways! Alright, I'll help you. You really remind me of a fool. And fools need all the help they can get. So in the fairytale I say, "Why are you, Ivanushka, unhappy? Why hung your head so low?" - What? - Be silent. That's the script! So you've already told me you request? Blah-blah-blah. "The task is difficult, I must agree"? Blah-blah-blah? "But I will tell you as a friend This task is not yet the real challenge." So on and so forth? "Then the little stallion says to Ivan?" Aha! Now listen up! You're gonna go straight at first... Get out! I thought of everything. But didn't think about this. The stone requires a living soul. A human soul? Otherwise the Alatyr won't come to life! Besides you, Katyusha, there's no other living soul around here. So forgive me. I'll have to take your soul out. "And so the talking stallion sent Ivan into the Neverending Forest and told him that whoever he meets along the way will show him the road to Baba-Yaga's place." Ivan? Come to me? Ivan? Come to me? Come to me? - I've waited for you for so long. - Who? are you? Take my hand. Tell me that I'm beautiful. Very? beautiful. I'm so cold? Make me warm? Kiss me. What are you yelling for? So I have a tail? So what? Is that a problem? No, men are really quite astonishing! Everything is going great, but once they see the tail it's all over. They grab their swords and start screaming. Decided to kill me have you?! Why "kill you?" Just maybe confuse you a little. You think I'm happy sitting here all by myself? Once in a 100 years a brave hero passes by. So why are you sitting here then? Good question actually. Let me think about that one. Probably not because I like it, but because I've been chained down! Can't you see it? Here! - Why? - I'm the bride of Koschei the Immortal. Koschei has been trying to win me over for 200 years! He is disgusting, but because of my tail I don't have many options. Then he took some stones from the Stone Princess. Or was it something else they were fighting about? Don't know really. So she kidnapped me and is holding me here. Listen, brave hero! Maybe you can let me go free? For you it'll be a heroic deed, you'll get all sorts of fame for it. Good for both you and me. Please! You only need to swing your sword once, but I'll get my freedom. Only don't try any of your? Oh please! Am I my own enemy? "Thank you, brave hero!" Evil spirit! - Any fish biting? - Naah? After that whole story with the old woman she doesn't stick her nose out. Wait. Who... are you? Not Gvidon Saltanovich by any chance? No. I'm Ivan? Not the fool? I don't think so. - And not the tsarevich? - What tsarevich? Just Ivan. Nickname Vanya. Great. Nice to meet you. And I'm? I'm? the 34th warrior. - What do you mean 34th? - Don't you know... "The sea will rise up turbulently, Seething, howling, It will flood the empty shore, Dissipate in a flash, And on the shore there will appear?" - Well? - What? Young man! "Dressed in scales, burning like fire, 33 warriors!" Beautiful poetry? - Beautiful! - There you go! But in reality? it's 34 warriors! Chernomor had 34 warriors in his army! Do you understand?! "Dressed in scales, burning like fire, 34 warriors." Sounds horrible! Doesn't rhyme! That's why I was fired. I was laid off to save the rhyme and rhythm of the poem. Chernomor even said to me: "It's nothing personal." Ever since then I serve Baba-Yaga. Look after the lake for her. Such humiliation! I'm a warrior afterall! But instead of a sword, I've got, see - a fishing rod. If only I'd had a sword, then I'd? Only I must have a sword! Listen, warrior! Let's exchange! I'll give you a sword! And you take me to Baba-Yaga? My dear man! First time I see dinner coming over the second time of it's own free will! - Listen, old woman, you know what? - What? "You're a foolish old woman?" No insults! "Ivan-Tsarevich said to her:" "You first give me a drink." "Give me, brave hero, some food." "And then ask the questions!" Ah? eee? "Immediately Baba-Yaga gave food and water to Ivan-Tsarevich, "put him into a bed to sleep and started asking the questions:" "Where are you traveling, Ivan-Tsarevich?" "Going far? Traveling of your own free will or against it?" That's chapter 5 "Baba-Yaga and?" You rascal! Are we going to go through the entire script or what? Only keep in mind, I don't have any food! We'll talk without it! Where are you going? Our Katya is in trouble. I recognize my daughter's signature in all of this, the Stone Princess. Where is it? So this stone flower must be decorated with diamonds? These are no ordinary diamonds. These are the diamonds that Koschei keeps! "And so Baba-Yaga told Ivan, how the young Princess cried because she did not want to do evil in the world. But the magic spell had already started working, and her tears turned into small diamonds. Those were the very last tears of the Stone Princess. And their magical power is so strong that if one decorates Alatyr with them, a miracle will happen! So Baba-Yaga instructed Ivan: no matter what happens, he must carry out what she has told him to do!" Oh misery! I am giving you the very last one! I was saving it for myself for a rainy day! It's a drop of life-giving water! It's such a rare thing! I cannot even bear to part with it! I am only giving this to you for Katya, otherwise I'd never give it away! Here! I simply can't bear this! I need this myself so much! I'm old now! Anything can happen? What am I going to do without life-giving water? Here! Thank you! Mistress! I am. Here! Alright, good luck! Take this Ivan to Koschei! Go straight. After 50 sazhens take a right. - After 50 sazhens take a right. - I'm tired of you! I need to stop at the village to get Kuzma. Without him I won't be able to defeat Koschei! Turn right. After 5 sazhens? Turn right? And I tell you: take me to the village. There's nothing for you to do in the village. - Kuzma has been killed. - What?! What? Nothing. Keep going straight. Take me to the village now or I will unwind you! Destination changed! Do not change destination! Do not? Kuzma! Kuzma! Kuzya! It is no use crying over spilt milk. Now keep moving. Wait! Warning. Quantity of life-giving water is enough for one use only. Kuzma! I thought, you were killed. Vanya? I saw a dream. As if I was up in heaven eating a pineapple. But it was really sour, so afterwards my mouth was hurting. There goes my dream! Gotcha! Getting married is no cakewalk. Done with running away! - Jump in the fire. - What?! - Jump in the fire! - Jump yourself! Attention! The client is being told to jump, but he's not jumping! Hold on, you fur face! Ivan! Ivan? He was a brave lad. He really didn't want to get married? - Burned himself alive. - Yeah! Let's drink to his memory? So why did you bring him here? How many times I told Yaga: only use the fire exit in cases of dire emergency. - Dire! - Delivering a message. From Baba-Yaga to Koschei the Immortal. "I ask to return the diamonds that I had deposited and to place them in the hands of Ivan present here." Diamonds! What diamonds? And who do I give them to? Look at this lifeless body! People handle this sort of travel very differently. Maybe he's going to pass his human spirit away right now. Koscheyushka! What's going on? We've got here? A brave hero. Again! Hour by hour it doesn't get any better! Promiscuous woman! There you go? your brave hero! You? Koscheyushka! You've got it all wrong! - I will explain everything! - It's he who's going to explain everything! Hey, peasant! Who's are you? What did you come for? Tell me the truth, you've come for my egg? For the diamonds. Diamonds! What diamonds? Ha? My diamonds! D'you hear that, he's come for my diamonds?! Like I'm gonna give them to you just like that! Lad, did you get a little too much heat in that fire? Or you don't want to live anymore?! The diamonds are not yours. They have been deposited with you. Dep? Wha-a-at? Deposi? Depo? Used to be yours, now they're mine! Koschei! Give him what he wants! Alright, why? - Ouch! My tail! - Sorry! Why? Because he saved me! He cut the chain that held me! - Cut the chain? - Yes, cut the chain! - Oh, the chain! Saved you? - Saved me! And he wasn't seduced by you? No. Because he is in love. You weren't seduced? Alright. He cut the chain, let her go free and wasn't seduced. Is that a normal man or what? Like I'm gonna buy that! People have no shame, no conscience nowadays? My prescious darling egg! Alright, where is it? Here it is! My darling diamonds! Dev? Dev? Depo? I would never have given them away! Koscheyushka! Listen to me! Alright, got it! You have my fishy over here to thank for this! Here, catch! See, brave hero, I came to be of use to you afterall. Don't you start flirting now! Or I'll change my mind. Oh, you scared me! Mindchanger! It is necessary to relocate to the Stone Tower. The Stone Tower?! Jump into the fireplace then! Again? Again what? Don't be scared! Be a man! - You're the "brave hero" afterall! - Goodbye, evil spirit! Cheeky oaf! You better not lose those diamonds! "Ivan saw Katya standing on the top of the Tower, and her soul was being transferred into the Alatyr Stone." Katya? "And such horror gripped hold of Ivanushka that words cannot describe it. He understood that without Katya life has no meaning for him." Katya! How are you doing? Katya! She's there! I need to go to her! Not a problem! Hold on! Katya, help me! Katya, I love you! Ivanushka? My destiny? My heart and soul! Stay with me. I beg you. Let us go. Let him go, and I will stay! You don't love me. Go, both of you. Faster, before I change my mind. Yangul? Do not worry about me. My heart is made of stone. Well! Thank you. Catch them! - Leave them! - Catch them! That's an order! Let them be. They love each other! You won't understand it. There are things in this world more powerful than your magic, Princess. Once I had spared you. You are stone! So remain a stone forever! Now talk to me about love. Big boulder! I would like to drink to our deceased? Our highly respected deceased? would decease well, so to speak? Yes. The deceased! Get away! Get away! Run away! Get away, Katya! No! Hit it! Katya. Katya. Katya! Guys! Guys! He's alive! Grab him! The Barin is doing him such an honor and he! Is running away from marriage to the world of the dead? Go wash up and change your clothes! You're going to your wedding! Well, Yaga? If you lied to me? Ardars! Everyone stay where you are! Hands behind your head! I will kill people one by one. If you don't give me the Alatyr. Let's start. Katya! Vanya! You're alive? I brought her back to life, so I'll kill her once again. If only? I understand. Here! What have you done? Ivanushka? - Don't give it! - Here is what you need! "Ivan carried out the orders of Baba-Yaga and decorated the Alatyr with diamonds. And the diamonds once again turned into tears. And such power was in those tears that the Stone Princess remembered everything: how she was a young girl, how she loved her mom, and how she did not want to do evil. And those tears melted away the stone heart of the Stone Princess, and a miracle happened." I remember. I remember everything. I'm crying? You poor poor girl. So unfortunate. Are you feeling sorry for me? "And they will obey the Stone Princess, untill the day that stone cries, and a human being feels sorry for the stone." Vanya! And now, when everything has ended so happily? I want! I want to get married! Then get married! But to the person who will marry you of his own free will! - And who'll do that?! - I will! Klava, I love you so much. Will you marry me? I will. And I will say the following? Gorko! "After that Katya and Ivan lived very long and happy lives. And they had children? They had many children. And I went to visit them and ate their pies and drank their kvas. That is the end of the fairytale, and the person who listened?" Hey, you! Yes, you! Why are you getting up from your seats? I haven't yet finished the fairytale! Running for the door already! Oh, young people! Young people! Come again. I will have such an interesting fairytale for you! Do come again.
