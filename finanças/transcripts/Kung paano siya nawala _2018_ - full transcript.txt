What time is it? I have to go to work. It's only 6:00. -I might be late -Stay a little longer, Lio. Wait. You stay here. Stay here. Stay put. I'm so sorry, miss. Lio? What's wrong with you? Who did you think it was? I thought it was your sister. It's dark. Have you seen my phone? My brother is downstairs. Just relax, okay? - Mimi. - Minnie. - Mimi! - Mimi. That's what I said. There, Leo. You need to end your calls properly. - It's Lio. - Lio. Felix, my e-mail is acting up again. I told you, Cheska, if you run Facebook, it will lock everything else. I'm not, okay? - By the way, have you met Cheska? - Hi, Cheska. We met yesterday, Lio. That's right. Felix, my e-mail. You're in trouble. - She seems angry. - She bites. Anyway, Friday morning, Kwarto Bar. It's a tradition here. It's also your welcome party. I have something... There's only six of us here. Just shove it in, Lexy, so these can fit. There is so much stuff. So, I'm thinking of cutting my hair. What a waste, Lex. You'll give your brother a hard time. That's why I'm letting you know. Brother, I'm getting a haircut, okay? Let's do it together, Mom. Lex, if it was only that easy... Hey! This is Donny's, right? Donny can't live without that, Mom. Stop calling him uncle. Uncle. I was close to calling him Dad. Too early for this. Come on, Mom. Just buy a new... Give it to him. Buy a new one. He's near. You two take care of this. - Is your Mom here? - No. Call me if you need anything. - What? - What's up? What happened to you? Hit my head. Come on. Let's drink. Here. Here you go again. All you do is gossip. You get nothing out of it. Let's drink. What are we waiting for? Let's have a shot! - What age did you lose your virginity? - What? How do you like your women? Tell him you're taking him home. He's not answering! How do you like your men? You're taking someone else's... Hey, are you okay? You're pushing too hard. Buy her one, sir. You want one? How much? Thank you, sir! Let's go! You didn't say "thank you." I did. - Have you ever made out in public? - What? You want to? Was it bad? Just right, it's soft and moist. It's actually good. Do you have a girlfriend? But if you had a girlfriend, you'd still make out with me? At least you're honest. Honest cheaters are rare. Aren't you going to smoke that? I don't smoke. I saw you inside, it looked like you'd rather be somewhere else, so I decided to join you. - Where do you want to go? - I want to go home, to be honest. Lame! I want to go to La Union. I can go there right now. I'm so sick of this place. I don't like it here. Okay, let's go. - LU? - Can I come? - Let's go to LU? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Game. Let's go. You said LU, right? I'd already gone far! You had an excursion. - So far! - You did. You left me here. I thought... - What happened there? - Where? - Clumsy! - This? No... - Did someone beat you up? - No. I was running, then... Stupid. Nice! I'm into stupid guys. It should be like that. Keep going headfirst until you're bloody. No pride without a beard. I mean scars! Hey! You thought you could escape? Where am I? Bro, it's me. I just wanted a change. Change your attitude not your hair. And you should stop being a brat. Hey! You two. Goodness, why get drunk when you don't even drink? How did I get home, Ma? Your office mates dropped you off. Hey, is Victor gay? His shirt was so tight. Mom, I'll teach you how to block calls. Hey! That's forbidden. Someone's looking for you. Lio? You know me? It was hard to find you. I couldn't find you and Lexy on Facebook. My name is May. Do you know him? Pilo Macaraig? Filomeno Macaraig? Your Dad. He's my Dad too. We're siblings. I've been looking for you since we got back from Tarlac. I don't understand why you don't have matcha tea! All coffee shops have it! You're the only one who doesn't have it. I'm sorry, sir. I'm the one that has to be understanding? Hey! Hey? - How are you? - I'm okay, you? I'm okay. Can I order? The menu isn't on my boobs, sir. I was just checking your name. Of course. Let's go to La Union. You... - You forgot me. - It's not that. My head still feels a bit off. It's still kind of... - How is it? - It's fine. Nothing serious. This is where you work? No, I'm just here for a week. I'm learning how to be a barista. My next movie is the comeback film of John Lloyd Cruz. - I'm preparing for the role. - Really? No. Strike one, Lio. Shana. Come back for me. Hey! Am I that forgettable? We've made out. I know your favorite coffee. And you don't remember me? Wow, how's my self-esteem? Shana! Face blindness? I can't remember people's faces, so I don't recognize them. So how will you remember me? Your stare is so intense. I need to memorize your face and over time I'll recognize you. But if I don't see you often, I'll forget you. See that dog? If you see that bulldog somewhere else tomorrow, you won't know it's the same bulldog. So, we look like bulldogs to you? That's not what I'm saying, Shana. I'm joking. I get it. It's just hard to believe. Is it weird? We'll figure it out. Your phone! Memorize this. Later. I'm still here. There's something different about you. Your voice? I'm just hoarse. You're not Shana. Hey, Lio. Sorry. Hi, Shana. So, you're messing with me. No, it's just hard to believe your condition. So you think I'm making it all up, for what? For attention? That's a really creative illness I made up. Okay, take care. Hey... Lio. I'm sorry, Lio. Don't be like that. He has issues. The meeting started at 1:30. Where is the ARD compilation? About that, sir... Lio, have you submitted to me your weekly ARDs? Yes, yesterday. You submitted it yesterday. - Seriously? - Sir, I gave them to Cheska. I'm Fae. You thought Fae was me? -Fae, I gave them to you... -Nope. You didn't give them to me, either. There's only six of us here. Sir, what were you explaining earlier? Here's our agenda. Later at five o'clock, we'll do planning... I'm still not used to this schedule. - That's right, from accounting? - Yes! That's me. Anyway, can I ask a favor, Lio? Can you accompany me? I just need someone to talk to. I love places that don't close. All places should be like this. I'm bothered by something. I hurt someone. Friend, but with potential. I'm such an idiot. I did something I shouldn't have. How about you? Are you a forgiving person or do you hold grudges? But it's not the mistakes that I forget. What I forget is the person. Hi... Shana. Fuck, you knew it was me? For a while now. I was having fun watching you pretend. Fine, I'll give you something to remember. So you always know it's me, okay? There. That's the hairstyle you had when I first met you. - To our new beauty parlor! - What? To our new beauty parlor. - To our... - To our new beauty parlor! Shana? - Whiskey! - It's okay. How did he get in here? How old is he? I don't know. They found him on Katipunan. His owner abandoned him. PAWS rescued him and I adopted him. Is this your house? No, I'm just the caretaker while the owner is trying to sell it. You've lived here long? I left from home six years ago. Then I started living with Kelly... Actually, someone died here. - That's why it hasn't sold. - What? - So you took all of these? - Yes. The owner didn't get mad? No. Mama Triccia loves me. You know all of them? Some I came across, some came across me. They're all there. Preserved. I used to think I was an artist. I took Fine Arts in Bulacan. Right? But I didn't finish. I only have a year left. But before that, I studied biology. - Kinesiology. - Why did you keep switching? I couldn't find what I was looking for. For the record, I'm not easy. We've already kissed, we've fought, we've gotten drunk. I didn't say anything. What are you thinking? That you use sex to apologize to someone you've offended. - Did it work? - No. Need one more. How? Pervert. You're gross. - One more time? - I'm game. - Me too. - Right now. - Yeah, I'm game. - Sure. Right now? Eat first. It looks like you have no plans of doing anything. Are you just gonna lay there and let me do all the work? I'm just kidding. Come here. I'm in line. Are you hungry? Who is that in blue? Dio. In white? Jason. Just remember, Dio is always stiff, serious. Jason's the roundish one. Who walked in? That's easy. His skin is dark. It's Mark. He's always chatting with Dio. No, it's Jason. Inconsiderate. - Sorry, miss. - Your date will arrive soon. If it doesn't reach you Please accept my apology I didn't forget you It's still you in my heart And if I hurt you... Who else knows about your face blindness? You, my family. Everyone else thinks I'm just abnormal. I don't want them to think that. I don't care about them. - Then why did you tell me? - I don't know. You're the only one I told. When I was a kid, I liked to play basketball. But my friends never wanted to play with me because I would pass the ball to the wrong player. Then my Mom tried to explain my condition to my school. No one believed her so I was bullied, until I had to transfer schools. When it comes to work, same thing. I always screwed up. People would get mad at me because they felt I was rude and that I didn't care. It's hard. Hard to make friends, hard to meet people. So, I'd rather not. What is that? Rum and Coke. It's too early for that. Lio, where are we meeting tomorrow? I hope Lexy can join too. Lio? That's right, you won't recognize me. Dad told me. Where's Lexy? She can't make it. May, I want to ask a favor. If it's okay, call me instead if you have any concerns about your father. I mean, please don't contact Lexy or our Mom. Do you need money? - No. - I can send you some. I can lend some. - Just give me your account number. - Brother. - Can't we all just get to know each other? - No, we can't. For Dad. How is he? We don't need your money. - Hello, Babe? - Why aren't you picking up? I'm at work. Can't take calls, why? At the caf√©? I'm behind the bar answering your call. - Are you really at work? - Sorry, babe, I can't hear you. - What? - Babe, what's wrong? Babe, my boss. - Can you leave? - I just started my shift. - Is there a problem? - I just wanted to see you. -Can I wait... -I work until 1:00 a.m. Fine with me. Cute, right? Cute. Super cute. I told her about my... - Wow. - Really? - So she's the real thing! - She's the real thing. Her glam team is charging one million pesos. She's just a blogger. That's crazy! Bro, your vibe's so different. She hit me hard, you know? This is Whiskey. This is the dog she rescued. Wow! You're so giddy. Babe, get the other one instead. Maybe you'll beat your three-month record. Please, kids, don't be celebrities. Hurry up, my headache is getting worse. Look at me. Your eye bags are bad. Try this. I'm on fourth day of my juice cleanse. Do you notice I'm glowing? - Sounds like torture. - Juice cleanse! I look pretty. You two need to be more like me. Excuse me, Mom, you want me to be pretty? Camille, can you believe how my kids talk to me? Because you don't need to see the people you're talking to. Do I need to look for a dance instructor? Up to you. Excuse me, Mom, I don't live there. You're good. - Mom, who is Ricky? - My boyfriend. Get that away from me. I'm going to smell. If you want to get on her good side, tell her how young she looks. Say her juice diet is working. That she's blooming. I'll say, "Oh Lio, you didn't tell me you had an older sister." - Is that okay? - I guess so. - I'm sweaty. - You're nervous! - Don't introduce her so I can say my line. - Sure. Lio? - This is Shana, my girlfriend. - Hi. - My mom is inside. We'll follow. - Okay. Let's go. - Do you know who that is? - My mom's boyfriend. That's Ricky Davao! Seriously, I've never seen a ghost. A ghost rode at the back of my car once. At the back. Did you know the American Cemetery at BGC? Before it became BGC, it was a military camp. One night I came from a shoot, by myself, then when I looked in the rear view mirror, someone was in the back seat. - No way! - It's true. Also, the person in the backseat, looked like me. As in me, Ricky Davao! - I've got goosebumps! - I keep having nightmares. I have a hard time sleeping and I always have dreams that someone is in the backseat. I always dream about my childhood. Me too, Brother. But for some reason, Zayn Malik is always involved. I'm okay with Zayn Malik. - Who's that? - One Direction. What about you Shana? I don't have dreams. I don't know Auntie, maybe I don't remember them? What are you scared of Lio? You're so macho. He couldn't sleep with a light on. - He's got you beat. - He does. Lexy, she's scared of everything. She can't even go to the bathroom by herself. There's a ghost in there. Seriously, you've never been scared your whole life? Twice. The first one was when I had the accident and the second is when I lost Lexy. - When was this? - I was 12, she was 6. I never told you this You probably don't remember, Lexy. Mom brought us to a mall, then she left us because she had a meeting, so I brought you to the playground. You played there while I waited for you to finish. I took your hand and walked to Jollibee then you suddenly cried. When I looked to see why, it wasn't you. What I remember, you wearing a light blue shirt and light blue shorts. So I went back to the playground and sought help from the guard. Nothing. I was so worried, I wanted to cry. I was about to shit due to fear. Lio, stop that! Good thing I remembered your favorite was Dora the Explorer. So I went to the department store, at the section of Dora. I found you there hiding. Then you said... - "Found you!" - "Found you!" And I couldn't stop laughing. Then you hugged me tight and I wasn't scared anymore. Good thing I didn't know, Lio because I would have killed you. She looks so young. She was only 20 when she gave birth to me. - Then the girl beside her is Lexy? - Yup. She's cute. They look like each other. - Are you close? - Yes. They're the only two people I know in this world. Three. - Me. - Yes, you too. - Your Dad? - Gone. They separated when I was still young. - I think that was me. - It was me. Was it you? Okay, Babe. I'm going to shower. I have work. - You have older brothers, right? - Yup. - You're close? - With who? Your older brothers. Just right. No, not really. Your Mom and Dad? Haven't seen them in about a year. Why? They're pretty angry at me. Actually, my niece is being baptized on the 24th, and my brother Ajay is pushing me to go. - But? - But, I haven't fixed my schedule at work. Come on, how often will she be baptized? - I really want to get it out. - No. You can handle it, you're a big boy. Do you still need tape? You want? - To our new beauty parlor! - To our new beauty parlor! - Do you know him? - No. That's you. And... This one. That's you. - This is us. - Great. Look at this one. - Who's that? - My sister. Nisha. Nisha. Cute. We're really close. The youngest. Where is she? She's dead. Who knew one can die from that. I carry all of them with me. You still remember your Dad? No. It's like... I just imagined him. I can't picture him in my head. I don't remember anymore It's like I just made him up. Do you know he's here? He's back? - Are you going to see him? - No. Fuck him. But you know, if you love someone, then they leave, they're still in your heart, right? Yes. For me, when people leave, everything is erased. Do you understand? I don't know why. Is it because I can't hold on to their faces? But even if you forget someone, you won't forget how they made you feel, right? I don't know. Because if they disappear from here, then they disappear from here too. It's hard. Because even the memory of them, I can't bring back. Where have you been? Have you been drinking? You're drunk? Slightly. Bottle opener? Want one? Hurry. - Ajay. This is Lio. - Wow. - You decided to show up. - I came from work, sorry. It's good that you're working. - Caf√©, I work the night shift. - Wait. Are you drunk? You hardly even show yourself to us. You better not go inside like that. Let's leave. You don't need to go in. Come. Let's go. I know this song. I like how she sings. Don't carry all of it, give the rest to me. I love you. Really? I love you too. Wow, you have a big smile today! You sure? You ate that? - I wouldn't eat that. - Fuck, I never said I ate it. Will you please buy your own toothbrush! It's clean. You're done. Handsome. Wow, shame on us! Why? No jumping. Just getting some air. Smoke? - You came with Shana, right? - Yes, you know her? How's Whiskey? You keep leaving me. But babe, I haven't seen my friends in a long time. Can you just try making friends! So, just text her because we have to go. So what? Those hip-hoppers, thinking they're gangsters. They're just hypebeasts from Pasay. You're so mean. They're good friends. They always take care of me. That... That Pete. How long have you known him? A while. He told me... Really? How dramatic. So why did that asshole say that? He was addicted to crystal meth back then. I helped him rehab. I locked him in that room for two weeks. - So you're a therapist? - He was my boyfriend. He's your ex? Why didn't you tell me? - Do I need to tell you everything? - I tell you everything. That's not important, babe. It's important. You're so different when you're with them. You're the one who's different. Jerk. - Should I spell it out for you? - You don't have to go. No, this is not good. I left everything for our family now you're going to leave us? Then go! Go leave with your other woman! Lio! Lio! Daddy! Daddy? - Daddy? - Lio! Lexy! Who is that with Camille? Why? Don't go yet, okay? Are you leaving? Wait. I swear, if no one was here, I would've punched you. - Why? - May called me. I couldn't believe it. She even called me "Sis". - So, she told you? - You tried to hide it from me? I told her not to. She called you? Did you tell Mom? Don't tell her, she might get depressed. - Hey! - What? That's art. I'm sorry, I'll fix this. - How? - Lexy! Wow, there's lot of people. Congrats to Camille! Are you drunk? Oh, there she is! What happened? They're inviting me to show in their gallery. Just let them drool. Shana, did you sell to Benjie? Look at him, he's so wasted. Benj! Oh, is he alright? Who else would he have gotten it from, if not you? What are you saying? If you can't handle your wasted boyfriend... - Look at you, you're so high! - How dare you? I'm not. Check yourself, you haven't changed. How are you? Have you changed? Looking good! How many boys are you seeing now? Say hi to your sponsors for me. Why are dragging me? Wait, just wait! What are you doing? It's so embarrassing! Fuck! - Why did you do that? - What is she talking about? You believe her? I don't, I'm just asking what she's talking about. I left my bag. It's too embarrassing to go back. You get it! - Okay, just sit. - Okay. Fine. - Get my bag! - Okay. Calm down. Were you a drug addict? When I dropped out of college, I didn't have a job, so I helped my friend with his business. What kind of drugs? - What kind of drugs? - What the hell? You're the one who's mad? Hey! What, I'm suddenly a different person just because you found out something about me? How dare you bring up my past and judge me? I thought we wouldn't do that? Where are you? Who's with you? May. May, I told you not to call or text Lexy right? I thought that was clear? Not now May, I'm busy. About your Dad, we already talked about this. Don't bother us anymore. Shana? Whiskey? Whiskey? Babe? Is Pete here? Is that him? You drank again? For you. What happened to your arm? You're gone for hours. Your stuff are not there. It's swollen. It might be broken. I thought you're not coming back. - Where would I go? - I don't know. So were you with Pete? Just tell me, please. - Please. - Enough. Everyone in these photos you erased from your life. - But Pete you didn't? - Enough! So this is Pete? It's my sister's death anniversary today. I came from the cemetery. Just forget what I said. I don't know what's going on. Let's have this checked at the ER. But sorry, I will fix this, promise. No more of this. I'm going crazy. You're alive. What happened? Ricky and I are done. Why? I don't know, but it's all right. He's not that good in conversations and from the things he cares about, seemed like we don't have the same values. He can't handle the demands of my job. You ended it before it started. You broke your arm? But it doesn't hurt anymore. I know that your Dad is here. Son. Your dad. I thought after 20 years, the pain will be gone. ...it feels like it just happened yesterday. When times like this happen, like Donny and Ricky... Lio! I thought you understood her? - Goodness, where's the catering? Let's go! - Darlene. This is our super chill producer, Darlene. - My friend, Lio. - Hi, Lio! Super chill, huh? Whatever, let's go! It's 2:00 p.m. We're late. So, I thought you understood her. Okay, come with me. - Lio, you should talk to your Mom. - She's just scared. Lio, do you know what she told me on our first date? From the beginning, I already lost. I bought her a ticket for Japan, a birthday surprise for the two of us. You know what she said? "Yuck. There's too many Filipinos there, I'll stay here instead." That's how she is. I'm tired of it. Sorry, I'm done. The song is nice. Why did you stop? You're home early. - I resigned from work. - Why? No reason, I just want something different. I'll help you look. - For what? - A new job. - I'm hungry. You? - I'm okay. Boss! We're here. Bro! Felix. I'm sorry, bro. I thought... - You look lost. You live here as well? - No. Shana lives nearby. I live there at Cypress building. So you live around here? In Cypress. - Are you okay? - Okay. - Good, tomorrow okay? - Tomorrow. Excuse me, the train is passing through. The service here is horrible. - To our new parlor! - To our new parlor! I'm gonna cry! - You're too much! - What's your problem? Finally, they left. They stole my scene. - You know, Lio's kind of weird. - We're all weird. I know, we're all weird but Lio is off. You guys are crazy. They're just drunk. - His stare is so intense. - Like this? There's always a ten-second delay before he answers. Maybe he's autistic. Lio is face blind, okay? He has a problem with his brain, he can't remember faces. Now is that okay? Did you get it? Are you guys done? Hey! - What are you saying? - Shit, oh my god. - Who the fuck are you? - Fuck you! Lio! Sorry, he's my boyfriend. - Calm down. - I'm sorry, he has a condition. - Talk to your damn boyfriend! - I'm sorry. Lio! Lio! Lio! Why don't you just tell everyone I'm abnormal? Lio, I'm sorry. You know that I don't want anyone to know about my sickness. I don't know what to do with you. I can't keep up with you, with your life. You know you're my whole life, am I the same to you? Every time I think of the things that I don't know about you, I get scared. Babe, I don't understand you, I just want to help. Like a project? Huh? I already know why you chose me. Because I am easy to leave behind. Thug. Do you know who I am? Cheska. You wrecked my party, man! Stay here. What? I told May that we're going to visit Dad. Why did you do that? He's dying, so let's visit him. How dramatic. You shouldn't have done that, we're already okay. It's done, okay? Mom agreed. Mommy agreed? Impossible. - Who is that? - Shana. Then why not answer it? Bro, what happened? Sorry for telling them about your condition. Sorry if you can't trust me anymore. I just don't know sometimes, what you expect from me. What I need to prove to you. You're always judging me. When I feel like I'll get hurt, I run away. I had sex with Cheska. That night. I thought If I just... Because I thought... I didn't drink that night. I'm really weird. If you don't want someone abnormal, go find someone else! There's a lot of guys anyway! Enough. You always blame everything on your sickness. Just admit your real problem. That's your real sickness. Bro. Bro. I'm visiting him. No matter how much we ignore him, he's there. I'll regret it if I don't see him. Please don't be mad at me. Why is it when it's too late, that's when... things get clearer. I shouldn't have said this, I shouldn't have done that. I've got it all figured out. When it's too late. I'll go with you. Okay, Uber's here. Lexy. Lio. Lexy? Is that you? Lio. Do you remember me? No, I didn't forget you. Jayma, this is Mark. To our new beauty parlor. To our new partner. It's too early for your love lines. What? You know I hate that term. So how did you know that he's the one? - When I blew him in the parking lot. - You pig! Why? I don't have time to be demure. It's really tiring to wait. Hi! Good morning everyone! - Tomas. You're here. - Good morning. Shouldn't you be sterilizing the cattery? You're wrong. - I was assigned here in the dog run. - I am never wrong. Just once, when I chose to love him. - Well! - Well! - So great! - Perfect! Wonderful! Lio someone's looking for you in the office. - Oh, it's me Dennis. - Yes, I know. Just tell them, I'll be there. - How did you know that's him? - The beard. How about me, how will you recognize me? If I see someone pretty, I will know it's you. So you're going back there? Yes, you'll never know. You'll never know. - Hello, Mrs. Cortez and Mico! - Oh, here she is. This is Emma. Emma? Where did you find Emma? In the province, we rescued her before she got butchered. You know she's my favorite here, so take care of her okay? Can I change her name? Sure, what name would you like to give her? Bienvenido S. Capistrano Park. - Huh? - Oh, the park near us. - Where do you live? - Why? Are you going to visit me? - What is his name? - Hammer. - Where did you find him? - Just there somewhere. What does he eat? Is this a boy or a girl? What do you think, for Hammer? A boy. He's cute. Where do you work? Guess. Wow, he's cute. Why did you take him? Oh, here you are. Let's go. - Bye! - Say bye, Hammer.
