Let her rest. I'm glad you called me. Susan had another asthma attack. I'm on my way. One moment, George. Was this absolutely necessary? You're the boss, and I've no right to question your work. I'm only a doctor here. But I'm sorry, I think this is going too far. The papers are always full of... fake news. But maybe one day we will perform a heart transplant. It might happen. But George, that day is nowhere near. We're not properly equipped for transplants, and this is very bad publicity. You're my brother, and I have to tell you these things Don't you know that other doctors are already making fun of us? Mr Philip Holden is not a doctor. He's a guy that can help clear the clinic's debts. He's a millionaire from Nevada who owns banks, hotels, oil wells. He read the article and he liked it. And he called wanting to see me. - So this was done for him? - It was. There's always a reason. You'll see, I'll get the money we need. Don't go, George, she's been very sick. I've never been so worried for my sister. I asked the clinic to send a nurse. You know very well I'll send her away. I don't want anyone in my way... just to ease your conscience. I can't postpone this trip. Sure, I know... If you don't find the money, the boat will sink. I've been directing the clinic for many years, and I don't mean to stop. If I did, the clinic would be finished. Among other things. You mean our marriage? The clinic always comes first. - Don't blame it all on the clinic. - You're right... You're to blame. The clinic is just an excuse. If that makes you feel better, fine. How long have you been working for us? This is my second day, doctor. Otherwise I would have noticed you. You should know that my wife is a rather difficult woman. Work hard and maybe she'll come to trust you. Do you understand? These are her drugs. This is Listofel, for asthma attacks. She often has them. Almost every day. Be very careful. Every evening give her 20 drops of Neurosedyl. That's a tranquillizer. Careful not to mix them up. It's very dangerous. Neurosedyl can cause choking if administered during asthma attacks. I'll be very careful, doctor. And now, you must meet my wife. - Be patient with her. - You must love her very much... Of course. Light me a cigarette. - When did you decide to break up? - Last night. - We could have talked about it. - We already have. It didn't help. So what happened? Nothing. Nothing new, at least. - I'll take you to the station. - If you want. I can't imagine you in San Luis Obispo, back with your family. Larry will buy me out. He'll keep the studio. We've already agreed on it. You offered Larry the studio? You've been thinking about this for some time. Yes. Obviously, I have. Why do you want to leave? It seems you're running away. Yes. Maybe I am. But I love you. And if I stayed, this would never be over. D0 you really want it to be over? Yes, I want it to end. Susan is Catholic, she'd never agree a divorce. If she weren't so sick, I might have found a way... and you'd be my wife by now. Are you so sure I'd have agreed to marry you? If you don't want to get married then what do you want? A man of my own. I don't like to share my partners. Let's say good-bye here. I hate long good-byes. They're ridiculous. How can I get to San Luis Obispo? San Luis Obispo? It's that way. - You have to turn round. - Thanks. Tell me, George, how's it going to end for us? I don't know. l do. One day I'll get off that train... and you won't be waiting for me. No... We'll work it out. - This is for you, sir - Thanks What is it? My brother. He's called three times. George? It's Susan... She's dead. Dead? It's incredible... So long ago it seems like another lifetime. After taking the drops, Susan must have sent the nurse away and was alone. She'd already done it, unfortunately. The girl didn't think to wake up Martha before leaving I don't think she'll be going back to the clinic Leave us alone, George D0 you need something, George? A sedative I drove all night and my nerves are shot What you need is something to get you to sleep Doctor... Nude's not enough these days. It needs to be disgusting Try some of these insects. They're fashionable now Maybe I'll use this sea cricket. What do you think? Yes, good idea. Try on her breasts - Like it? - Hmm, no - Here? - No. Further down - Here? - That's good Move a little, let me see What do you think? I don't like it. Millipede might be better Millipede? That's even more disgusting than a sea cricket - I'm ready with the lights now - Well, I'm not ready Come on Larry, think of something An idea... it's not easy. I guess "'Beauty and the Beast" was dumb - What about something funnier? - I told you, use a millipede But that's disgusting... Come on, that's too much Wait, wait - Let's hear this one then - Yeah A dragonfly would be good, no? - A bit different, but... - Yes, put it on her behind Yeah Turn around a bit... That's it That's not bad, is it? How could Martha not know? She wouldn't wait a month to tell me She found the policy today, in a drawer Why are you so worried? Had she left you bills to pay, I'd understand No, that's good. Try something else, darling Your dead wife left you a million dollar insurance... Yes, that's good, like that... ...and you're complaining Come on baby, turn round, a bit sexier Susan was a woman, and you know how unpredictable we can be That's not news to you, right? Turn around, sweetie Why make me beneficiary of a million dollar policy? That's more than unpredictable Well she did, and that's what matters Pleasure and horror With all that money, one could do many things That's enough... always eating If I were you, I'd thank your dear dead wife Yes, I'd be very thankful Stick out your tongue, like this... Good But you don't get it, Susan always hated me She used to blame me for being alive while she felt like death We hardly ever spoke It got so bad... she'd lock herself in her room for days Yes, I know she even stopped the staff going up there At those times, only Marta and I were allowed to see her Dr Dumurrier. .. Telephone call for you Thank you Yes? One moment, please It's the Fidelity Trust. They're asking for you... It's fine, there's nothing to be afraid of George Dumurrier here You'll get all your money. Yes, this week I said it'll be paid A million dollars takes care of everything And this policy... You didn't know about it, George? No, Henry I didn't know a thing - The check, please - Right away That was Henry. I have to go to the clinic I'm sorry about our evening How does he know you're here? We didn't plan it I don't know. I'll ask him That's a good idea It was a silly excuse Sit down. No need to be gallant here I'm trying to make you comfortable, George I ran out of cigarettes. D0 you have any? I didn't know you liked these kinds of shows Why don't you ask her name? Why? Curiosity Monica Weston D0 you know her? I asked a question I don't know her That phone call I had, someone told me to look to my left I did, and I saw the poster What poster? The poster to this place. She was on it You mean her picture? Yes. I was shocked by her resemblance to Susan I mean, if you look at her in person, they look so alike Yes, it's incredible But why didn't you tell me? It all sounded so... so absurd Ask her to our table Why would I? I told you, curiosity Hello ls this all right, sir? Yes, thanks You ordered champagne, very refined Are you visiting our city of sin? No, we live in San Francisco Ah, so you're not foreigners Well, you can sin in your own town That's even more exciting Your friend is beautiful. She's very... feminine Look, if you guys want to treat yourselves, give me your offer, and I'll tell you yes or no So isn't that what you're looking for? - What do you want? - Nothing We just want to drink some champagne with you All right, then let's drink! OK, what's up? Why are you staring at me like that? Right, I've had enough here - It was very nice meeting you - You're two real oddballs Did you see the color of her eyes? Yes, they're green Well, Susan's were brown Who is it? How the hell did you get my number? I bought it. For $200 $200? What do you have in mind, the two of you? The two of us? We don't want anything. It's just me You won't believe me, honey, but I'm shy What you guys were offering me at the club is not for me I prefer the simple and normal way The natural way, just two people... No complications So no threesomes? That depends on the money, darling Have a look around, honey This is a nice place. Elegant, chic even But it's very expensive, - and I need to pay the bills - Yes, I can imagine But that's not a problem for you Someone like you, must be loaded, eh? Let's say I have enough money to do any stupid thing that comes to mind Good for you As I'm doing now Well, thanks for the compliment Sorry. But at times, pleasant things are stupid Umm, listen, what's-your-name... I am not a genius You talk a lot, and I don't understand you So explain yourself, right? Never mind. That'd be even more stupid Look, honey, do something intelligent right? Take your clothes off What's the matter, sweetie? Sex make you speechless? Well it's better than the ones who bore you with their problems Why? You don't smoke? I've never smoked. I don't like it People with asthma can't smoke Who's this now? Can you answer it? Like this? I can't... Come on, honey - Hi - Hello Monica, honey, can I have my drops back? What drops? The sleeping drops. I bet you didn't even use them Oh, those, yes I did use them. They're here somewhere Say, Monica, you remember that guy from last night? Well, you can't imagine... These what you're looking for? Yes, that's it. Thanks... Why's he laughing? Maybe I'm not 100% normal, but that doesn't mean I'm crazy It's me who's crazy Ignore him. He's usually quiet But when he speaks who knows what he means Answer that Can you get it? Hello? Hello... Monica Weston, please I'd like to speak to Monica Weston Who is it? Hello Who? Carol? Carol Timmons? No, you got the wrong number Yes, this is Monica Weston. I don't know anyone by that name Dumb Carol Timmons Never heard of her, don't know her And Jane Bleeker? - Jane who? - Bleeker Nope Why did I call? Guess I don't want to. I want you to tell me All right, I will Go back 3 I had this idea that Susan could be Monica That's a good one Absurd, isn't it? That doesn't explain why you called Yes it does Suppose you want to be someone else... If you cut it here, we can use it If someone calls you and says they know you, at first you pretend to know who it is and let them talk I tried this with Monica If she was Susan, she'd have fallen for it, don't you think? I don't buy it Now it's your turn, George I believe you slept with her to test her too Come on, Jane. Let's check these pics We're wasting time You like it? Don't we have a close-up? Yes, but I don't think we need it, do we? They're only interested in... Wait! Go back one... You like her, right? Me too. She's very hot But the best bit's down here - Have you seen her before? - I know her But I can't remember who she is I tell you, I was about to give up I followed Dumurrier for days, and didn't notice a thing A regular 9W He's having an affair, but nothing suspect So what is it? Look at this That's his wife, Susan Dumurrier - Presnell... - It was taken a few years ago Now look closely at this one. What do you think? It's still Mrs Dumurrier, only her hair is different. That woman is not Mrs Dumurrier She's alive and well Her name is Monica Weston and she's a stripper They must be the same person Not only is Monica Weston alive and well, but she and Dr Dumurrier are, let's say, very close A very strange coincidence Exactly what I thought You know, Mr Bent, I bet the police would be interested to hear our story Get out of the car Come on, babe, hurry up What the hell do you want from me? I'm just doing myjob Ladies first You looking for Monica Weston? Yes - Who are you? - Police But why are you here? What's happened to Monica? Nothing, she's fine She just went to the station for a chat Then why are you searching her place? Look". Is Monica in trouble? What is it? Is there anything I can do for her? What you can do is get out of here But I want to... Beat it At least, tell me what you're looking for I'd like to know that too D0 you see anything, inspector? Yes, spots, scribbles... Next slide AnYthing now? No Number 5 See, this is an S, then U, another S, A, and this is N Susan. Can you see that? Number 6 In this slide, Dumurrier was enlarged so you can see it better Susan Dumurrier Turn off the projector This is the paper towel we enlarged - Where'd you find it? - Monica West0n's apartment We found it in a drawer She'll regret being careless Indeed It proves she was forging Susan Dumurrier's signature It was for a woman A woman who was... who was very sick She had an incurable illness... and was going to die very soon No one cared if she lived or died Apart from the insurance company They cared a million dollars' worth That's a lot of money Indeed Get me the DA Here's the confession She says it was this woman called Betty Monica describes her as... tall, elegant, about 40 She always met her alone Always dressed differently Monica thinks she wore a wig - Just Betty, no other name - No, and no address Only the phone call before they met up And she gave her 20,000 dollars After she signed the policy as Susan Dumurrier, Betty paid her In cash... and then disappeared Like a ghost Yes... What about Dr Dumurrier? He's the only one who profits from her death What did she die of? An asthma attack She suffocated in the night Did she have any other illness? Not that we know of No thanks Asthma is not usually fatal Unless there's some underlying issues He's a doctor and should have known how to treat her It's a close likeness You said you never knew Monica Weston I told you how I met her The telephone call and the poster, right? You don't believe me? To be honest, doctor... It seems you have a vivid imagination... as we've seen many times before lfl made something up... it would be a better story than this one Your wife might have been murdered Did you ever think about that? Who would think such a thing? I would And I'm not the only one That's why we're having your wife's body exhumed I'm sorry, but the law requires this, Miss Yes, it's her, it's her. Now can we let her rest in peace This is our report on the Dumurrier's case Enough curare in her body to kill a horse It's a poison that suffocates, like asthma When your friend Betty told you... that your double was sick and that she would die soon, you believed her right away, yes? And you never suspected, not even for a moment, that someone might be interested in sending her to the grave? Don't you know that the accomplice to a crime... is just as guilty as whoever committed it? We're now certain that Mrs Dumurrier was poisoned And you are also responsible for her death But we can be lenient with those who help us find the truth This is something you should consider I already told you all I know I don't believe you There's something here that doesn't make sense If Dumurrier used this woman Betty to get to you, why did he meet you at the Roaring 20's? You think that Betty doesn't exist, that the doctor and I are partners? That's just what I think All right I'll tell you everything, Inspector There it is You didn't look in there, did you? We didn't know we had to dismantle the place I didn't know that, either Take that envelope to the lab. It'll clarify everything Lean backwards, against the rail. Yeah, like that No, not so sexy Hold that one... What pictures? The ones when George was in the studio He thought he knew that girl - Lean to one side - We have to find her Have to find who? That girl. She wasn't a model. You found her in a strip club In a strip club? Oh, the girl with the red wig. She was a hooker That's all for today Yeah, I know who you're talking about She was dancing in one of those places It was more than a year ago That woman was at George's house the night his wife died I know now where he saw her She was the nurse Eh...? Oh, right Right... yes Tell me A (109 A black poodle I want to pay Monica West0n's bail She was let out 2 hours ago A newspaper in his mouth? We might find the dog, but not the newspaper - Who paid the bail? - What's it to you? No miss, the dog's sex is not important I'm sorry, sergeant But it was 3000 dollars It was very hard for me... to get such a sum together Then you should be happy you still got it Yes miss, I'm still listening Yes, call us every ten minutes Yes, all the police in San Francisco will be looking for you dog The restaurant Vagenende 42, Boulevard Saint Germain I'll talk to you later So now you are spying on me like a child, Benjamin? You've got a French lover? Yeah right, a lover! Will you ever stop with this story? I'm in enough trouble already, if you only knew I went to the police. I wanted to pay your bail Oh, Benjamin... I can't believe you did that! I'd never allow it Now I'm sure you have a lover Yes, you're right Someone that loves me more than you do But it's a woman It's me $3,000 is a lot of money Maybe I'm rich What do you know about me, after all? Benjamin. Leave me alone It'd be better for you if we'd never met But we have, and now it's too late. Not for me. I'm fed up with yourjealousy. No Monica, I'm notjealous. It doesn't bother me if you sleep with other men. But if it's only one man, then it's the end for me Everything ends sooner or later. No, not this. This cannot end I ask so little of you, only that you stay here You and I... just every once in a while Whenever you want... Can't you see, you're my whole life Monica, if you take this away from me... I'll have nothing Nothing, understand? And then you'll kill me, right? Yes... I'll kill you I want you to go now Go away Well? Yes... - Not bad - Thanks Jane, we're ready! - Jane is my partner - Yes She's very good You'll see, if she likes the model, she'll take the pictures Here she is What do you think? It's good. I'll do it I'm off to see a Mickey Mouse flick Didn't you recognize me? Yes, but there was no reason to mention it You were more confident at the Roaring 20's You were more friendly It's different in our world, Jane Does he always go to Disney movies? Not always. Only when I ask him D0 I look okay? You're perfect What if we turned the lights off? Your partner only talked about doing some pictures And you only do pictures? No, but it'll cost more That's not a problem, honey - I can turn it off if it bothers you - It doesn't bother me Who is she? She's a dancer. Her name is Elizabeth O'Neill You probably know her as Liz She used to sleep in your room. You used to be close - I don't know her - You worked together... at Carol Doda's, in September You can't deny that And I can tell you the rest Such as? Rumors A friend of mine heard about your relationship All right, turn it off I want to meet that girl She's left San Francisco If you know where she is, you must tell me That's all you wanted from me Yes, that's all I'll pay any price for that information So this was your set up I thought the newspapers were exaggerating when they spoke of your famous "findings" Much written about me is true except for one thing: I didn't kill my wife And to prove it, I need to find your friend Liz - She knows nothing about this - She does And you know more than what you told the police I told them everything More than you can imagine He's still up there OK, we'll look for this Elizabeth O'Neill, interpretive dancer and nurse in her spare time - You don't believe me, do you? - Sure I do You don't believe me Show that picture to my sister-in-law or at the clinic Someone will recognize her Yes, it's possible that Liz poisoned your wife... while you were away But it'll be hard to convince a jury... that you didn't pay her to do it You really think that's the way it happened? All I know is that the women involved in this case... Betty, Monica Weston, and now this dancing nurse... didn't have a motive to kill your wife You were the only one who did, Doctor You got the insurance money. That's a primary motive Yes, but... that doesn't prove I'm guilty No, I agree But tell me one thing... does agreeing to blackmail equal a confession of guilt? - Blackmail? - Yes... Monica Weston confessed She told me why she called you to the Roaring 20's that night No, she's not the one who called It was Monica Weston She called, and you came at once And the next day you gave her $10,000 No, I never gave her money Come on, Doctor, we found it In this envelope We found some fingerprints on it which are now being examined If they happen to be yours... you understand, it'll be the gas chamber The girl's the only one who can save Dumurrier - If she's still here - Or if nobody killed her - That would be bad - Yes, really bad It's open... No... No... She couldn't have left me A French lover... Boulevard Saint Germain... restaurant Vagenende It must be here... It must be here somewhere... She must have left it... Mr Benjamin... Mr Benjamin... Don't send me away, please I haven't finished looking You know you can't do this, give me the key - The key? - Yes Should we bring him in? He won't tell you anything, just that she ruined his life That could be entertaining If this Monica West0n's gone, we'll call the FBI Or Interpol if necessary We're going to death row - What's your name, sir? - Henry Dumurrier Are you carrying any packages, cameras, alcohol? No - You can go, then - Thanks Show this pass at the next gate I asked the lawyer to leave us alone No one else can hear us now It's a prisoner's right I really don't think I've got much to say Jane". can take care of herself, Fortunately I don't have any children I know The clinic was your family - I could have never done yourjob - Well... That's why I thought I might as well sell it Thanks to the policy, we don't have any more mortgages or debts It was a good deal, things look much brighter now It's like receiving an interest free loan A transaction that'll cost me my life, Henry Yes, a transaction... that in the end, went my way As you have no children, I'll be the one to benefit from your death The jury didn't consider that They're convinced you're guilty... because you benefitted from that policy They didn't think to investigate my interests Me... your brother... and heir Of course I could have killed you myself, but that would be risky So now the state will do it, and do it for free Henry... what are you saying? You still don't get it, George? It's me, your own brother, who is sending you to the gas chamber You... killed Susan No, no-one killed her Susan is alive And she's as healthy as you and me... you until tomorrow morning, that is Calm down, George They can't hear us, but they can see us Sit down if you want to hear the rest of the story, or I'll have to call for help... as my brother suddenly became crazy But I saw Susan dead Saw her with my own eyes Try to remember George, how long did you see her? You were so tired that night and overwhelmed Don't you remember? You wanted a sedative, but I gave you some sleeping drops instead The nurse? The people at the morgue didn't know Susan Of course we had to bury someone else instead, so we killed the person who should have committed the murder, the dancing nurse, Elizabeth O'Neill When you saw her at the morgue, her corpse was already decomposing Unrecognizable So Martha knew too Martha would do anything for Susan Susan has a good sister, while you have a bad brother... a brother who's been sleeping with your wife for many years You see, this situation couldn't last much longer On the other hand, it would be absurd and stupid... to simply end it with a divorce Our father left the clinic to you because you were his favorite And he left me nothing I had to make my own way... without a cent Frankly, I didn't feel like starting a new life with Susan... under such conditions You know Susan She needs a lot of money to be happy You know this better than anyone I've always loved her, George, But she chose you because you were rich Now you can see why I hate you This is not hate, it's madness Maybe, but brilliant madness You must admit that our plan was perfect Each move was precisely planned... and performed at the right moment It wasn't hard to create Monica Weston Strippers never stay long in the same place While you were on your business trips, we created Monica, gave her life, and made her popular here in San Francisco Susan never held back She did everything right to please those who were useful to us Betty never existed, of course You believed everything Susan wanted you to believe Who'd have thought she'd be such a great actress? What about the asthma attacks? Well, that was the easiest part. You're not much of a doctor, George That's why she used to lock herself in her room for days It was all planned, even things like the mistake with the paper towel It's quite clear how Inspector Wald got that envelope... with the money and your fingerprints You see George, I hate you I couldn't have you going to the gas chamber... without you knowing the truth And you think I won't try to defend myself? Of course... of course but I thought of that as well You'll probably get a 24-hour deferral... but it'll only prolong the agony Your lawyer will do his best to save you, and you'll wait here in hope It's a vain hope, George From the Governor to the people of San Francisco... everybody knows about the miraculous treatments... and the heart transplants that you made up to advertise the clinic It'd be only natural that now you'd come up with another story, an absurd one, to save your life The song of the dying swan It all happened minutes before the prisoner was taken... from death row to maximum security on the first floor, where he had to spend the night, watched by two guards chosen by him It's what they call "the death watch" At 10am tomorrow, it would all have been over We can't tell you more about this story We don 't know Mr Mitchell's latest evidence All we know is that George Dumurrier's attorney... was able to obtain a 24-hour deferral During which time, the Governor of California will decide whether or not to allow for a longer deferral to reopen the case This is an atrocious murder, Mr Mitchell And Dumurrier's social position makes it more complicated You're trying to create a new Chessman case... and to keep Dumurrier alive If we do that, we'd go against public opinion... and could be accused of being partial And all to find this Monica Weston... to see if she's got blue or brown eyes? Isn't that what you want, sir? Yes. Or at least we should get in touch with Henry Dumurrier And when we find him, on what basis can we indict him? Let's suppose for a moment that your story is true D0 you expect him to confess? No, he'll probably say that his brother's crazy Or that he made it all up to save himself Look, Mitchell, he'd do that even if he was guilty Yes but...why did Henry Dumurrier disappear? To give her the time to spread uncertainty Let's suppose Henry had a deal with George He risks nothing He just has to stay hidden for a while That's doable for a brother, don't you think? You think it's all fake? That's just a hypothesis But the expedient would fit with the character of George Dumurrier A rather cynical expedient, let me say it... that public opinion would not like at all In your theory the positions are inverted the convict is innocent and the victim guilty To say this ridiculous thesis out loud... could bring a defamation charge from the deceased's sister Yes, ltotally admit it. If Henry's disappearance is an expedient Thank you It's up to you... to prove that it's not The State of California granted you 24 hours the Police force is at your disposal, there is nothing more we can do. But if you weren't allowed up there... how did you know Mrs Dumurrier was in her room? Well, when Miss Martha went up there... we heard them talking Don't ask me to confirm that These questions are an insult to my sister's memory When Mrs Dumurrier died and you went upstairs... - did you see her dead? - Of course I did - And did you notice anything? - Notice what, sir? How the hell do I know? Something... Anything! Is there any news? Who do you want to guard your cell tonight? - So this must mean... - No, it doesn't mean anything It's the rule, you have the right to choose two guards, and I came to ask who you want But we don't know if you're going downstairs Keep calm. The police are working very hard No, I can't say which one it is What if you looked at the corpse? Not with these pictures lfl had her dental records, I could identify her There's no American who's never been to the dentist Would the teeth be the same? Teeth remain intact for a long time Bring me the corpse. I'll take a mould And then you'll be able to see I can tell you the Governor has authorized... the exhumation of Mrs Dumurrier's corpse That's all I can say - So this means... - I can't say any more Thanks Tell Inspector Wald that we're ready George, there's still hope ls it better... or worse? I don't know, but there are rumors in the prison It looks like they might have found something We examined it very carefully, and I can state absolutely that the person it belongs to... - is Susan Dumurrier - What? No, that's impossible I'm sorry, but this is the mould I took from the corpse, and this is Mrs Dumurrier's dental record from the police The teeth match perfectly I'm afraid there's no doubt about it But, this report is from the Dumurrier clinic It's only natural she would use her husband's own clinic Yes, but... You're suggesting that Henry changed the records? Tell me, do you believe George's story? I did all I could do. What I believe doesn't matter What did you put in my drink? Give me a hand I gave her something to help her sleep What time is it? I don't know, my watch is broken This is Donald Grant, KPAT, from San Quentin State Prison I am currently inside the priSon's gas chamber It's 10.30 am Exactly one hour ago, Dr George Dumurrier was brought here He sat on one of these chairs, and was tied with one of these belts After these procedures were completed, the door was locked by turning this wheel This phone is directly connected to the Governor's office in Sacramento, so the execution can be stopped even at the last second As you might know, the Governor had already authorized... a 24-hour deferral of the execution Attorney Arthur Mitchell had requested it... so he could introduce new evidence Which however was not considered relevant, and was thought to be the result... of George Dumurrier's infamous creative ideas Monica This happened in Paris at 11am about 2 am our time, 9 hours before George Dumurrier entered the gas chamber Those hours were crucial for his life A telex was received from the French Police Paris, February 2nd, 1969 Killed today, February 2nd, 1969, two American citizens from San Francisco, California The man is Dr Henry Dumurrier The identity of the woman is unknown The killer, Benjamin Wormser, also American from San Francisco, claims that the woman is Monica Weston... but her passport, number 109356, was issued to Susan Dumurrier The San Francisco Police received the message... only a few minutes before 10am It was exactly at 10am... when the lever to release the gas was about to be pulled, when suddenly this phone rang And Dr George Dumurrier was free This is Donald Grant, KPAT, from San Quentin State Prison, California
